1
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:33,651
Come in close.

2
00:00:36,265 --> 00:00:36,785
Closer.

3
00:00:38,499 --> 00:00:40,637
Because the more you think you see,

4
00:00:41,066 --> 00:00:43,074
the easier it'll be to fool you.

5
00:00:44,866 --> 00:00:47,071
I'm going to flip through this deck.

6
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:48,643
And I want you to see one card.

7
00:00:48,732 --> 00:00:50,365
Not this one. That's too obvious.

8
00:00:50,565 --> 00:00:51,844
Pay close attention.

9
00:00:54,465 --> 00:00:55,738
That was too fast. I'll do it again.

10
00:00:55,832 --> 00:00:56,751
Are you ready?

11
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:57,498
Okay.

12
00:01:00,166 --> 00:01:01,884
- Now did you see one?
- Yes.

13
00:01:02,099 --> 00:01:04,033
- Do you have one in mind?
- Yes.

14
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:06,131
Now, do you see your card here?

15
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:06,845
No.

16
00:01:07,632 --> 00:01:09,803
That's because you're looking too closely.

17
00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:11,934
And what have I been telling you all night?

18
00:01:12,033 --> 00:01:13,422
The closer you look...

19
00:01:13,566 --> 00:01:14,655
The less you see.

20
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:35,545
Now look into my eyes.

21
00:01:36,767 --> 00:01:37,806
And sleep. Okay.

22
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:42,559
And...

23
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,067
If you can get this bill
from me, you can have it.

24
00:01:47,266 --> 00:01:48,875
Go ahead. Take it. Get it.

25
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,861
If you can say your name, you can have it.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,409
All right, just hang out there, wriggle a sec.

27
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,842
I'm gonna take a little peek under the hood

28
00:01:59,933 --> 00:02:01,467
- of your hubby's brain.
- Oh, no, no, no.

29
00:02:01,566 --> 00:02:02,665
I'm picturing...

30
00:02:02,767 --> 00:02:04,545
- Don't tell me.
- Of course.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,109
Beach. Cocktails.

32
00:02:07,467 --> 00:02:08,046
Florida?

33
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,178
Look, it was a business trip.

34
00:02:10,367 --> 00:02:12,345
I mean, it is a kind of business.

35
00:02:12,434 --> 00:02:14,062
Maybe the oldest business.

36
00:02:15,434 --> 00:02:16,639
You know what, Honey Bee, let's...

37
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:18,146
She can't move, Mack.

38
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:19,800
You're thinking of a woman's name.

39
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,533
A, B, c, D, E, F, G H, L J...

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,329
J? Jean. Jane. Janet.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,859
Who's Janet?

42
00:02:28,701 --> 00:02:29,680
You know Janet?

43
00:02:30,034 --> 00:02:32,102
It's not your best friend, is it?

44
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:34,269
- Your sister?
- No, please.

45
00:02:34,367 --> 00:02:35,806
Her sister? Oh, my God.

46
00:02:36,701 --> 00:02:38,549
You weren't away on business.

47
00:02:38,834 --> 00:02:40,539
- You were away on Janet.
- No.

48
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:41,936
Your wife's sister!

49
00:02:42,601 --> 00:02:44,135
Okay. Now she's gonna get upset.

50
00:02:44,234 --> 00:02:45,303
Let's move over here.

51
00:02:45,401 --> 00:02:46,950
You want this to go away?

52
00:02:47,701 --> 00:02:49,701
- Yes.
- Okay, pull out your wallet.

53
00:02:49,901 --> 00:02:51,160
Come on, get it out.

54
00:02:51,434 --> 00:02:52,707
Do you shake down everybody like this?

55
00:02:52,834 --> 00:02:54,392
No, only the special few.

56
00:02:54,701 --> 00:02:56,736
What is this? Two hundred seem fair?

57
00:02:56,868 --> 00:02:58,903
You know what?
This is a big deal. Let's go $250.

58
00:02:59,001 --> 00:02:59,978
You're a stick-up artist.

59
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:01,140
Yeah. Of course.

60
00:03:02,534 --> 00:03:03,573
Okay, and sleep!

61
00:03:05,402 --> 00:03:08,312
Now, when I snap my fingers,
you won't remember any of this.

62
00:03:08,402 --> 00:03:09,634
And you, Warren Beatty,

63
00:03:09,834 --> 00:03:12,372
every time you see or even think of Janet,

64
00:03:13,035 --> 00:03:14,943
you're gonna picture me naked.

65
00:03:15,568 --> 00:03:16,670
And that's not a pretty sight.

66
00:03:16,768 --> 00:03:17,168
Yeah.

67
00:03:17,868 --> 00:03:19,487
And... You're wide awake!

68
00:03:23,101 --> 00:03:27,838
Well, we did the best we could,
but some people just aren't to be hypnotized.

69
00:03:27,934 --> 00:03:30,208
- I did it wrong?
- Come on, Honey Bee.

70
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,006
- Oh, no, you did it fine.
- Let me buy you dinner.

71
00:03:32,168 --> 00:03:33,147
Look after her.

72
00:03:33,435 --> 00:03:35,273
Just have to hit an ATM first.

73
00:03:44,168 --> 00:03:47,295
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am the next great magician,

74
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:52,669
and I will give $100 to anyone who
can tell me how this trick is done.

75
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:56,335
I have an ordinary spoon from Mel's Deli,
right here in Brooklyn.

76
00:03:56,435 --> 00:03:57,294
Check it out.

77
00:03:57,935 --> 00:04:01,132
Now, everyone
please pay very, very close attention.

78
00:04:01,835 --> 00:04:04,942
Because I'm about to
bend this spoon with my mind.

79
00:04:15,369 --> 00:04:17,744
Thank you. Thank you. Pass that around.

80
00:04:17,835 --> 00:04:19,336
- What's this?
- What are you doing, man?

81
00:04:19,436 --> 00:04:22,533
Look at this! Looks like
we got a spoon and a stem.

82
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:23,872
I've got other tricks.

83
00:04:23,969 --> 00:04:26,037
Or you could give me my 100 bucks.

84
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:27,303
You said you would.

85
00:04:27,436 --> 00:04:28,245
Nice wallet.

86
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:29,940
You have a very good eye, sir.

87
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:30,556
Thanks.

88
00:04:38,202 --> 00:04:38,722
Wallet.

89
00:04:39,736 --> 00:04:41,004
My wallet. My watch!

90
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:47,488
Stop that guy!

91
00:04:47,736 --> 00:04:48,839
Stop that guy in the leather jacket!

92
00:04:48,936 --> 00:04:50,194
He's got my wallet!

93
00:04:54,136 --> 00:04:55,295
Okay, Los Angeles,

94
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:57,406
are we ready to end this thing?

95
00:04:57,503 --> 00:04:57,903
Yeah!

96
00:04:58,603 --> 00:05:00,221
When that timer hits zero,

97
00:05:01,103 --> 00:05:03,360
a tank full of flesh-eating piranhas

98
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:04,832
will fall from above.

99
00:05:05,536 --> 00:05:08,144
A lady has to have handcuffs. Right, girls?

100
00:05:08,503 --> 00:05:09,542
One, two, three!

101
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,103
Yeah!

102
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:40,989
Help! Stop it!

103
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,798
She's serious! She can't get out!

104
00:05:47,537 --> 00:05:48,626
Go get some help!

105
00:05:49,737 --> 00:05:50,486
Help, dude!

106
00:05:52,437 --> 00:05:54,335
Get out of the way! Move! Move!

107
00:06:30,538 --> 00:06:32,156
Come on! This is bullshit!

108
00:06:32,704 --> 00:06:35,192
Whoever thought of this is a sick sadist!

109
00:06:40,371 --> 00:06:40,711
Yes!

110
00:06:43,405 --> 00:06:44,784
I am your biggest fan.

111
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:46,947
I could tell by the way
you're attacking my face right now.

112
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:48,277
Close the door. Bad apartment building.

113
00:06:48,371 --> 00:06:50,169
- Magician, come here.
- Okay.

114
00:06:52,071 --> 00:06:53,606
- Wait, wait.
- What? What?

115
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,083
How did you do that...

116
00:06:55,271 --> 00:06:56,578
The seven of diamonds
on the side of the tower?

117
00:06:56,671 --> 00:06:58,569
- Yes.
- That's a trade secret.

118
00:07:00,338 --> 00:07:02,646
I'll give you a hint. It involved
bribing the tower electrician.

119
00:07:02,772 --> 00:07:03,401
How much?

120
00:07:03,938 --> 00:07:04,567
50 bucks.

121
00:07:05,238 --> 00:07:07,080
- But it's so hard.
- Oh, thank you.

122
00:07:07,204 --> 00:07:08,273
Is it always a seven?

123
00:07:08,371 --> 00:07:09,974
I could do that trick 52 different ways.

124
00:07:10,072 --> 00:07:12,139
Can you do 52 different tricks on me?

125
00:07:12,338 --> 00:07:13,505
I'll see what I can do.

126
00:07:13,705 --> 00:07:14,394
Magic man!

127
00:07:15,772 --> 00:07:17,041
I love your shampoo.

128
00:07:19,471 --> 00:07:20,560
- Hold up.
- What?

129
00:07:23,105 --> 00:07:24,105
You need to leave.

130
00:07:24,239 --> 00:07:25,239
Are you kidding me?

131
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,472
Oh, my God, this is so embarrassing.

132
00:07:27,671 --> 00:07:28,671
Is this what you do?

133
00:07:28,772 --> 00:07:30,705
Some kind of sick trick you do to women?

134
00:07:30,905 --> 00:07:32,294
"45 East Evan Street."

135
00:07:33,172 --> 00:07:34,582
Don't worry about it. I'll call you.

136
00:07:34,772 --> 00:07:36,172
You don't have my number.

137
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,407
I'm magic. I'll find it. Have a good night.

138
00:07:38,506 --> 00:07:40,004
You are such an asshole.

139
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:51,179
Hey!

140
00:08:53,006 --> 00:08:53,526
Henley.

141
00:08:54,407 --> 00:08:55,156
Danny? Hey.

142
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,098
You got a card, huh?

143
00:09:00,273 --> 00:09:02,512
No, no, no,
it's good for you. Congratulations.

144
00:09:02,607 --> 00:09:03,584
All right, so here's what I'm gonna do,

145
00:09:03,707 --> 00:09:04,980
I'm gonna go inside.
I'm gonna scope the place out.

146
00:09:05,073 --> 00:09:07,409
You wait out here. I will come back
and get you, okay? Do not come in.

147
00:09:07,507 --> 00:09:09,373
Hey, Danny! I'm not your assistant anymore.

148
00:09:09,573 --> 00:09:10,262
Nice hair.

149
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,645
So, actually, what have you been up to?

150
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:14,843
I think you know exactly
what I've been up to, Danny.

151
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:17,679
I saw all your anonymous
posting on my website.

152
00:09:17,774 --> 00:09:19,013
You have a website. That's good.

153
00:09:19,107 --> 00:09:21,005
Good for you. Get the word out.

154
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:23,740
Okay.

155
00:09:24,874 --> 00:09:27,871
So apparently none of us
was the only one chosen.

156
00:09:28,174 --> 00:09:30,742
Let me be the first one
to kick my ego to the curb.

157
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,974
Yeah. Excuse me.

158
00:09:32,107 --> 00:09:33,880
- Door's locked.
- Is it? I'll check.

159
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:36,109
You. Now, hold it, don't tell me.

160
00:09:36,673 --> 00:09:37,592
Helen? No, no.

161
00:09:38,408 --> 00:09:38,927
Henley.

162
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,074
It's on your coffee cup.

163
00:09:41,274 --> 00:09:42,910
Thanks for keeping me honest.

164
00:09:43,007 --> 00:09:44,542
That wasn't mentalism, by the way.

165
00:09:44,673 --> 00:09:45,742
It was just an observation.

166
00:09:45,874 --> 00:09:48,212
Second observation, you are beautiful.

167
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,530
Thank you.

168
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,508
That's good. That's very nice.
Very well-polished. Nice bit.

169
00:09:53,608 --> 00:09:55,686
J. Daniel Atlas. Nice to meet you.

170
00:09:56,107 --> 00:09:58,818
Very nice. I know who you are and I just want
to say that I'm not interested in you doing

171
00:09:58,907 --> 00:10:00,010
your mentalism thing on us.

172
00:10:00,107 --> 00:10:03,041
Especially when we don't know
who brought us here or even if it's real.

173
00:10:03,241 --> 00:10:06,987
Hold on, I'm sensing...
I'm sensing you are a control freak.

174
00:10:07,408 --> 00:10:08,675
I'm sorry, have we met before?

175
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,284
It doesn't take a mentalist to figure that out.

176
00:10:10,374 --> 00:10:11,408
You are a control freak.

177
00:10:11,508 --> 00:10:12,679
Well, I take that as a compliment.

178
00:10:12,775 --> 00:10:13,980
Only he would take it as a compliment.

179
00:10:14,075 --> 00:10:15,518
Good. Another compliment.

180
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,208
So that's why you're no longer a couple.

181
00:10:17,374 --> 00:10:18,408
A couple? No, no.

182
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:19,678
We were never a couple.

183
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,373
He used to saw me in half.

184
00:10:21,674 --> 00:10:22,743
She was a very good assistant.

185
00:10:22,841 --> 00:10:23,818
But I was too fat for Danny.

186
00:10:23,908 --> 00:10:26,681
No. I said that one time
because of the trap door.

187
00:10:26,775 --> 00:10:27,980
No one could fit through there. No one.

188
00:10:28,075 --> 00:10:29,242
Rebecca fit through.

189
00:10:29,441 --> 00:10:30,830
Rebecca fit for years.

190
00:10:31,108 --> 00:10:34,599
Do you know how hard it is to stay
in those tiny little costumes?

191
00:10:34,908 --> 00:10:36,696
No. I'm the main attraction.

192
00:10:37,042 --> 00:10:38,986
Okay. So he never made you feel special.

193
00:10:39,075 --> 00:10:42,362
And, trust me, you deserve
to be made to feel special.

194
00:10:43,108 --> 00:10:44,484
That's a really nice story.

195
00:10:44,574 --> 00:10:46,309
Hope you guys enjoy each other's company.

196
00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:47,018
No way.

197
00:10:48,841 --> 00:10:49,880
J. Daniel Atlas?

198
00:10:50,542 --> 00:10:53,110
Dude, I've seen everything
that you have ever done.

199
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:54,187
You're like...

200
00:10:54,575 --> 00:10:55,813
I idolize you. Seriously.

201
00:10:55,908 --> 00:10:57,409
From a true fan. It's so nice to meet you.

202
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:58,877
I'm Jack, by the way.

203
00:10:59,108 --> 00:11:00,518
Question. Did you get one of these?

204
00:11:00,609 --> 00:11:01,418
Yeah. Death.

205
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,379
The High Priestess.

206
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,544
I'm the Lover.

207
00:11:05,876 --> 00:11:06,805
Three minutes.

208
00:11:07,941 --> 00:11:08,461
Hermit.

209
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,843
So, what are we...
Are we waiting for someone?

210
00:11:12,042 --> 00:11:13,486
- Why are we just...
- The door's locked.

211
00:11:13,575 --> 00:11:15,483
Oh, no, nothing's ever locked.

212
00:11:25,776 --> 00:11:26,985
What is this place?

213
00:11:30,942 --> 00:11:33,150
Wow. Thought my apartment was nasty.

214
00:11:34,776 --> 00:11:36,504
Man, it's freezing in here.

215
00:11:38,609 --> 00:11:39,468
What's that?

216
00:11:39,876 --> 00:11:40,785
I don't know.

217
00:11:44,343 --> 00:11:45,312
What's it say?

218
00:11:46,575 --> 00:11:47,664
"Now you don't."

219
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:50,730
"A rose by any other name..."

220
00:11:57,176 --> 00:11:58,685
Guys, what's happening?

221
00:12:01,043 --> 00:12:01,902
Look at that.

222
00:12:09,276 --> 00:12:09,955
It's gas!

223
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:11,879
Relax. Just dry ice.

224
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:13,910
Cool.

225
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,944
Wait. What do you think this is all about?

226
00:12:17,043 --> 00:12:18,132
Hang on. Hang on.

227
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,529
I got nothin'.

228
00:12:24,943 --> 00:12:26,677
Okay. Thank you. Thank you for the delay.

229
00:12:26,877 --> 00:12:28,743
I'm just trying to create
the space for wisdom.

230
00:12:28,943 --> 00:12:30,643
Danny, be honest. Did you do this?

231
00:12:30,843 --> 00:12:31,946
No. Wait, did you?

232
00:12:32,077 --> 00:12:32,586
I wish.

233
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,898
Why didn't anyone ask me if I did it?

234
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:37,799
Oh, great.

235
00:12:43,576 --> 00:12:44,795
Electricity is out.

236
00:12:46,244 --> 00:12:47,453
Well, let's check.

237
00:13:04,777 --> 00:13:05,537
Blueprints.

238
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,356
They're incredible.

239
00:13:09,877 --> 00:13:11,211
Who do you think did this?

240
00:13:11,411 --> 00:13:14,168
I don't know, but I really want to meet them.

241
00:13:15,511 --> 00:13:16,360
It's a show.

242
00:13:36,911 --> 00:13:38,020
Merritt McKinney,

243
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:43,740
Daniel Atlas, Henley Reeves,

244
00:13:46,011 --> 00:13:46,820
Jack Wilder.

245
00:13:48,511 --> 00:13:51,588
Arthur Tressler
and the MGM Grand proudly presents

246
00:13:55,178 --> 00:13:56,337
The Four Horsemen.

247
00:13:58,744 --> 00:13:59,434
Thank you.

248
00:14:00,211 --> 00:14:02,382
Tonight we would like to try something

249
00:14:02,512 --> 00:14:04,699
that will, well, set us a bit apart.

250
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:06,380
For our final trick,

251
00:14:06,678 --> 00:14:08,656
we're gonna do something never before

252
00:14:08,745 --> 00:14:10,353
seen on a Las Vegas stage.

253
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:13,567
Or any stage for that matter.

254
00:14:14,911 --> 00:14:16,250
Ladies and gentlemen,

255
00:14:18,678 --> 00:14:22,336
tonight we are going to rob a bank.

256
00:14:33,412 --> 00:14:35,830
That's a lot of excitement for a crime.

257
00:14:36,245 --> 00:14:39,023
I'm getting excited.
What about you, people?

258
00:14:45,378 --> 00:14:46,417
One, two, three!

259
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:59,517
Sorry, sir. There's absolutely no
recording allowed during the performance.

260
00:14:59,645 --> 00:15:01,613
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure, of course.

261
00:15:01,745 --> 00:15:02,779
Let me just put this away.

262
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:04,186
Actually, I need to take that.

263
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:07,246
After the show, I can come
and give it back to you.

264
00:15:07,446 --> 00:15:07,845
Okay.

265
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:12,695
Okay, Okay.

266
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,917
Now, please, please, settle down.

267
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:19,516
Now who here has a bank
they would like us to rob?

268
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:22,524
That's a lot of people with a vendetta.

269
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,901
So we'll choose one at random then.

270
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,785
My associates will make sure
it's random. Right?

271
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,213
- Elvis, help me out, bud.
- Thank you very much.

272
00:15:31,413 --> 00:15:33,948
In Jack's bowl
are ping pong balls with section numbers.

273
00:15:34,047 --> 00:15:36,047
Jack, could you hand me a section number?

274
00:15:36,246 --> 00:15:37,724
Thank you. We are looking at Section B.

275
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:39,022
Where is Section B?

276
00:15:39,646 --> 00:15:42,413
Okay. There. It's gonna be
one of you guys. Get ready.

277
00:15:42,613 --> 00:15:43,920
I don't know why everybody's happy.

278
00:15:44,047 --> 00:15:45,076
It's only them.

279
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:47,397
Merritt, can I get a row, please?

280
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:48,780
Thank you, Merritt.

281
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,687
We are looking at row number 5.

282
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,699
Where is that?

283
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:55,217
And Henley, could I please
have a random seat number?

284
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:56,948
Oh. Lucky number 13.

285
00:15:57,479 --> 00:15:58,968
B-5-13. Where are you?

286
00:15:59,313 --> 00:16:01,800
Sir, please, stand up. There you are. Hi.

287
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:08,288
Could you just confirm for me that this
is, in fact, your seat? B-5-13.

288
00:16:08,414 --> 00:16:08,753
Yes.

289
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,913
Okay. Wonderful. Now, could you please tell
us your name and the name of your bank?

290
00:16:13,113 --> 00:16:15,141
Well, my name is Etienne Forcier.

291
00:16:15,547 --> 00:16:18,434
And my bank,
it's Credit Republicain de Paris.

292
00:16:19,113 --> 00:16:19,982
French. Okay.

293
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,014
We were hoping for something
a little more local,

294
00:16:22,113 --> 00:16:24,352
a kind of mom-and-pop
credit union with no security.

295
00:16:24,447 --> 00:16:26,482
But that's fine. A promise is a promise.

296
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:29,152
Could you please come up to the stage
and we'll rob your bank.

297
00:16:29,247 --> 00:16:30,806
And while he does that...

298
00:16:31,447 --> 00:16:34,553
There is someone here tonight
without whom we would just be

299
00:16:34,647 --> 00:16:36,625
four magicians working the circuit,

300
00:16:36,714 --> 00:16:37,747
trying to get...

301
00:16:37,947 --> 00:16:39,347
Well, actually, trying to get here.

302
00:16:39,547 --> 00:16:42,258
You probably know this man,
if not from one of the many, many

303
00:16:42,414 --> 00:16:43,619
companies he puts his name on.

304
00:16:43,714 --> 00:16:45,817
He is our friend. He is our benefactor.

305
00:16:45,914 --> 00:16:47,193
Mr. Arthur Tressler.

306
00:16:47,313 --> 00:16:49,382
Please, stand up, Art. Please, stand up.

307
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,488
The only man here with
the Queen's cell phone number.

308
00:16:53,214 --> 00:16:55,491
Actually, please, stay standing, Art.

309
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:58,486
I want to say that
when we came to Mr. Tressler,

310
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:02,117
we promised that, as a unit, we could become
the biggest name in magic.

311
00:17:02,248 --> 00:17:03,657
So we wanted to say, "Thank you."

312
00:17:03,747 --> 00:17:05,725
And by the way, Art,
you notice on the sign out front,

313
00:17:05,814 --> 00:17:07,881
we made sure we put your name on top.

314
00:17:08,081 --> 00:17:09,849
If you turn out to be as good

315
00:17:10,248 --> 00:17:12,048
as you think you are, dear girl,

316
00:17:12,248 --> 00:17:14,348
that won't be necessary much longer.

317
00:17:14,548 --> 00:17:15,786
We haven't done our closer yet.

318
00:17:15,881 --> 00:17:18,455
Why don't you watch it
and then you can decide for yourself.

319
00:17:18,548 --> 00:17:20,885
Ladies and gentlemen, Arthur Tressler!

320
00:17:21,114 --> 00:17:24,615
Thank you. And, of course, once again, the
Cardinal of Clairvoyance, Merritt McKinney.

321
00:17:24,814 --> 00:17:27,762
Etienne, what Jack
is bringing to the stage now,

322
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:31,808
is what we in the magic world
call a teleportation helmet.

323
00:17:32,081 --> 00:17:36,819
You will need to wear this, as it will allow
you to literally fold through space and time

324
00:17:38,381 --> 00:17:39,760
to your bank in the...

325
00:17:40,748 --> 00:17:41,087
8th?

326
00:17:41,982 --> 00:17:43,730
-9th arrondissement.
- Yeah.

327
00:17:44,082 --> 00:17:48,051
Now, once you are there, we will be able
to speak with you through this helmet.

328
00:17:48,149 --> 00:17:48,778
Now if...

329
00:17:50,115 --> 00:17:51,854
Oh, my God, that's beautiful.

330
00:17:51,948 --> 00:17:54,119
It has the added attraction
of being very stylish.

331
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:58,218
It's about time the French learned
from America on that subject.

332
00:17:59,615 --> 00:18:00,718
Is that a beautiful piece of headgear?

333
00:18:00,815 --> 00:18:02,833
- Thank you. Thank you...
- It is.

334
00:18:03,481 --> 00:18:05,390
Thank you. Thank you very much.

335
00:18:07,449 --> 00:18:10,915
But before you go anywhere,
could you please, pick a card, any card.

336
00:18:11,115 --> 00:18:12,034
Not that card.

337
00:18:12,449 --> 00:18:15,748
No, that's an old American joke.
You can take that one.

338
00:18:15,948 --> 00:18:16,927
Okay. This one?

339
00:18:17,582 --> 00:18:20,738
Show it to your friends in Section B.
But not to us.

340
00:18:21,249 --> 00:18:23,249
Okay, great. Now if you could
just sign your name there.

341
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,384
- Yes.
- In English, if possible.

342
00:18:26,249 --> 00:18:27,748
- That's good.
- Thanks.

343
00:18:28,783 --> 00:18:30,049
Put it in your pocket.

344
00:18:30,249 --> 00:18:31,977
And now for one tiny detail.

345
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:53,656
Now, Etienne, let's step into
this cockamamie contraption.

346
00:18:54,816 --> 00:18:57,055
And I'll step off of it. Bonne chance.

347
00:18:57,150 --> 00:18:59,148
It's 11:50 p.m. here in Vegas.

348
00:19:00,116 --> 00:19:01,884
That's 8:50 a.m. in Paris.

349
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:04,783
Your bank opens in less than 10 minutes.

350
00:19:04,983 --> 00:19:06,542
One, two...

351
00:19:07,216 --> 00:19:07,675
Three.

352
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:12,469
What the fuck?

353
00:19:12,949 --> 00:19:14,228
- Etienne?
- Etienne?

354
00:19:14,749 --> 00:19:16,693
It wasn't supposed to happen
like that, was it?

355
00:19:16,783 --> 00:19:17,363
Etienne?

356
00:19:18,417 --> 00:19:20,325
I liked that little French guy.

357
00:19:20,616 --> 00:19:21,645
Where did he go?

358
00:19:30,617 --> 00:19:31,766
Wait, there he is.

359
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:36,517
No, no, no, no, please, please, please.

360
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,024
This is Daniel Atlas. Can you hear me?

361
00:19:39,483 --> 00:19:40,722
Etienne? Are you okay?

362
00:19:40,817 --> 00:19:41,156
Yes.

363
00:19:41,983 --> 00:19:44,061
Perfect. What do you see in there?

364
00:19:46,316 --> 00:19:46,776
Money.

365
00:19:47,917 --> 00:19:48,776
Is this real?

366
00:19:49,116 --> 00:19:52,123
Yes. Looks like three million
or so Euros' worth.

367
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,385
Okay, now, here's what
we're gonna need you to do.

368
00:19:55,483 --> 00:19:58,726
I want you to take the card that you signed
out of your pocket.

369
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,450
And I want you to take the ticket stub
from tonight's show

370
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:04,452
and I want you to put it right there
in the middle of the money.

371
00:20:07,917 --> 00:20:08,716
Now drop it.

372
00:20:21,117 --> 00:20:24,323
Now, on the side of your helmet
you should feel a button.

373
00:20:24,418 --> 00:20:25,724
Don't press it just yet.

374
00:20:25,817 --> 00:20:27,557
That button activates an air duct

375
00:20:27,651 --> 00:20:29,679
that connects Paris to Las Vegas.

376
00:20:30,584 --> 00:20:31,917
Okay, good. Now you can press it.

377
00:20:32,117 --> 00:20:34,220
All right, now, Etienne, hold on tight.

378
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:36,325
You might feel a bit of a vacuum.

379
00:21:06,751 --> 00:21:07,670
Wait a second.

380
00:21:48,951 --> 00:21:51,285
Thank you, Etienne. Thank you, everyone!

381
00:21:51,485 --> 00:21:52,619
We are The Four Horsemen.

382
00:21:52,819 --> 00:21:53,798
And good night!

383
00:21:54,052 --> 00:21:54,802
Good night!

384
00:22:07,886 --> 00:22:08,745
Hold up here.

385
00:22:09,485 --> 00:22:10,354
Dylan Rhodes.

386
00:22:12,552 --> 00:22:14,655
What? I don't think I heard you correctly.

387
00:22:14,752 --> 00:22:16,141
Did you say magicians?

388
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:17,777
Yeah, Dylan, magicians.

389
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:19,467
Where are you now?

390
00:22:19,585 --> 00:22:22,732
I'm at Aria. I'm heading
up there to grab 'em now.

391
00:22:25,819 --> 00:22:27,728
FBI! Hands where I can see them.

392
00:22:27,819 --> 00:22:29,707
Let's go. Get 'em up. Come on.

393
00:22:30,553 --> 00:22:31,921
Let's go. Get 'em up.

394
00:22:32,486 --> 00:22:33,634
Put the book down.

395
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:35,075
Okay. You got me.

396
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:37,620
- Freeze! Hands in the air!
- Oh, my!

397
00:22:37,819 --> 00:22:41,146
Do one of you guys
mind giving us a hand with our bags?

398
00:22:56,386 --> 00:22:58,330
Boss, please tell me this is a joke.

399
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,455
I just got Willy Mears
to finger Paulie Attanasio.

400
00:23:01,553 --> 00:23:04,763
I'm a month, two tops,
away from blowing this whole thing open.

401
00:23:04,887 --> 00:23:05,816
Get Turkelson.

402
00:23:05,987 --> 00:23:07,124
He's in Atlantic City.

403
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,424
What about Cowan? Look at him.

404
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:09,963
He's just sitting there on his ass.

405
00:23:10,054 --> 00:23:11,222
Hilarious, Rhodes.

406
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,459
I love you.

407
00:23:13,154 --> 00:23:13,733
Asshole.

408
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,955
I don't have time for this magic crap.

409
00:23:16,054 --> 00:23:18,554
This crap just pulled
three million Euro out of a Parisian bank.

410
00:23:18,653 --> 00:23:19,756
- That's how much they got?
- Yeah.

411
00:23:19,853 --> 00:23:20,832
Actually, 3.2.

412
00:23:25,087 --> 00:23:25,826
Who is she?

413
00:23:27,287 --> 00:23:28,795
Alma Dray from Interpol.

414
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,563
I'll be working the investigation with you.

415
00:23:30,653 --> 00:23:31,824
You gotta be kidding me.

416
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,723
It's bad enough they got me chasing down
David Copperfield and Friends.

417
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:38,026
Now I'm being saddled with,
no offense, with Interpol?

418
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,325
I look forward to working
with you, too, Agent Rhodes.

419
00:23:40,421 --> 00:23:43,399
I'm sorry. I don't think I'm gonna
need your help on this. Okay?

420
00:23:43,487 --> 00:23:46,021
- Where's the French guy?
- I already spoke to him.

421
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,621
Oh, you did? You spoke
to my witness before me?

422
00:23:48,721 --> 00:23:51,778
Your witness? I thought
you didn't want the case.

423
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,369
Besides, he's useless.

424
00:23:53,721 --> 00:23:55,219
Oh, really? Why is that?

425
00:23:55,454 --> 00:23:57,728
Because he believes their magic was real.

426
00:23:57,821 --> 00:23:59,423
Oh, he believes the magic was real?

427
00:23:59,554 --> 00:24:00,997
You're right, he probably is useless.

428
00:24:01,087 --> 00:24:03,965
Is it okay with Interpol if we talk to him, too?

429
00:24:04,521 --> 00:24:05,210
Thank you.

430
00:24:06,721 --> 00:24:09,428
I have never stolen a thing in my life, okay?

431
00:24:09,988 --> 00:24:12,329
I tried to give
the money back, but they won't take it.

432
00:24:12,421 --> 00:24:15,764
Okay, okay, Etienne. Just 'cause I'm new to
this, can you explain to me how you went

433
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:18,188
from Las Vegas to Paris in three seconds?

434
00:24:18,387 --> 00:24:20,256
With the teleportation helmet.

435
00:24:21,055 --> 00:24:22,623
Okay, what the hell is going on here?

436
00:24:22,721 --> 00:24:24,494
He was hypnotized during the show.

437
00:24:24,587 --> 00:24:26,196
I told you, he's useless.

438
00:24:26,487 --> 00:24:29,290
Okay, I'll deal with you when I'm done
with this other bullshit.

439
00:24:32,288 --> 00:24:32,627
Hey!

440
00:24:33,455 --> 00:24:35,228
During the show,
half the audience was hypnotized

441
00:24:35,321 --> 00:24:36,721
to believe they were in the Philharmonic.

442
00:24:36,921 --> 00:24:39,229
I guess that "bullshit" was the trigger word.

443
00:24:39,321 --> 00:24:41,458
Okay. Ecoutez, buddy. Come on down.

444
00:24:41,588 --> 00:24:42,860
You're not in the Philharmonic.

445
00:24:42,954 --> 00:24:45,364
- How do you say "stop" in French?
- Stop.

446
00:24:45,455 --> 00:24:46,489
Tell him to stop.

447
00:24:46,588 --> 00:24:50,154
No, I can't. You just have to
let him finish his movement.

448
00:24:51,155 --> 00:24:52,704
Okay, I need a time-out.

449
00:24:53,121 --> 00:24:54,599
Too many French people in one room.

450
00:24:54,722 --> 00:24:55,591
Agent Rhodes!

451
00:24:56,321 --> 00:24:59,026
I'm ordered by my bosses
to provide a report.

452
00:24:59,121 --> 00:25:02,098
And until we have one,
I'm here, like it or not.

453
00:25:02,255 --> 00:25:03,562
So we can work together,

454
00:25:03,655 --> 00:25:07,758
or you can continue to follow behind
asking the same exact questions I'm asking.

455
00:25:07,889 --> 00:25:08,908
It's up to you.

456
00:25:12,922 --> 00:25:14,071
I'm not finished.

457
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:17,785
I just flew 12 hours,
after what was already a long day.

458
00:25:18,288 --> 00:25:20,296
And I do not handle jet lag well.

459
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:26,098
So if you want to see who can be grumpier,

460
00:25:26,222 --> 00:25:28,010
I promise you, you will lose.

461
00:25:29,955 --> 00:25:33,531
Fine. So which one of these idiots
do you want to talk to first?

462
00:25:33,622 --> 00:25:33,962
Him?

463
00:25:38,722 --> 00:25:42,092
Dylan, for the record, mentalism has never
actually been proven to be accurate.

464
00:25:42,189 --> 00:25:42,588
Okay.

465
00:25:43,289 --> 00:25:44,630
That is to say, that it's not a science.

466
00:25:44,722 --> 00:25:45,791
It's more for entertainment.

467
00:25:45,955 --> 00:25:46,644
All right.

468
00:25:47,222 --> 00:25:50,689
Just don't believe
everything the guy says. That's all.

469
00:25:51,822 --> 00:25:53,920
Please convey my deepest apologies

470
00:25:54,755 --> 00:25:56,494
to your colleague out there.

471
00:25:56,589 --> 00:25:58,930
I'm really sorry about this
whole Tranny Tuesday thing.

472
00:25:59,056 --> 00:26:00,195
I was out of line.

473
00:26:00,322 --> 00:26:01,311
Tranny Tuesday?

474
00:26:01,623 --> 00:26:03,294
Well, it's an arrangement
he and his wife have.

475
00:26:03,423 --> 00:26:05,128
Or might not have, if you believe

476
00:26:05,256 --> 00:26:07,666
everything Agent Fuller
is saying to be correct.

477
00:26:07,756 --> 00:26:10,359
But isn't there a proud tradition in the FBI

478
00:26:10,456 --> 00:26:11,905
of men wearing dresses?

479
00:26:12,956 --> 00:26:14,984
No shame, Agent Fuller. No shame.

480
00:26:19,856 --> 00:26:21,174
I'm just having fun.

481
00:26:21,556 --> 00:26:23,794
So, if you had nothing to do with it,

482
00:26:24,222 --> 00:26:26,791
then how did
the playing card get into the vault?

483
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:27,890
Oh, yes. That would be...

484
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:29,467
What do the kids call it these days?

485
00:26:29,589 --> 00:26:30,726
Oh, yes, that's right. Magic.

486
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:32,801
Just answer the question, okay, smartass.

487
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,808
All right. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

488
00:26:36,489 --> 00:26:38,424
You can keep that. Don't share it with him.

489
00:26:38,623 --> 00:26:40,641
It says here you are a mentalist.

490
00:26:42,057 --> 00:26:43,685
What exactly is mentalism?

491
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:46,798
Tricks, mostly. Some science.

492
00:26:48,123 --> 00:26:51,200
Targeted guessing
might be a most apt description.

493
00:26:52,157 --> 00:26:55,064
Along with some intuition
and the occasional...

494
00:26:57,057 --> 00:26:58,206
Voices in my head.

495
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:02,618
Says here you were
fairly famous at one point.

496
00:27:02,856 --> 00:27:04,923
You can
even hypnotize people over the phone.

497
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,624
Some big tours
around the U.S. for a few years,

498
00:27:07,724 --> 00:27:09,632
- two TV specials.
- Glory days.

499
00:27:09,924 --> 00:27:13,390
Then your brother/manager disappeared
with all your hard-earned money.

500
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:14,797
Did your research, did you?

501
00:27:14,891 --> 00:27:16,279
IRS audit. Back taxes.

502
00:27:16,824 --> 00:27:18,563
You've had a long hard slog back

503
00:27:18,657 --> 00:27:21,067
into the limelight,
haven't you, Mr. McKinney?

504
00:27:21,157 --> 00:27:25,263
Yes, indeed, it has. And I do appreciate
that trip down Memory Lane.

505
00:27:26,058 --> 00:27:29,227
As far as I understand it, when the man
from Paris put on the magical helmet...

506
00:27:29,323 --> 00:27:30,183
Listen to me.

507
00:27:30,457 --> 00:27:32,992
If you didn't rob that bank,
then you knew about it.

508
00:27:33,091 --> 00:27:34,194
Which makes you an accomplice.

509
00:27:34,291 --> 00:27:36,700
So if you wanna walk out of here
today, I'd suggest you start...

510
00:27:36,791 --> 00:27:39,334
Now you listen to me, unless you think
there's a D.A. in the state of Nevada

511
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:42,124
who'd be willing to make sense of this to
a jury, then we have a show to perform.

512
00:27:42,324 --> 00:27:44,764
And you, Agent Rhodes,
have a drawing board to get back to.

513
00:27:44,891 --> 00:27:46,390
Is this your first date?

514
00:27:47,425 --> 00:27:47,824
What?

515
00:27:48,624 --> 00:27:52,398
No, I mean, obviously, you guys don't
know each other well, if at all.

516
00:27:52,491 --> 00:27:55,667
But, like,
there is a palpable tension in this room.

517
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,829
And before you get involved,

518
00:27:57,991 --> 00:28:01,458
you should consider the fact
that she has a lot of big secrets.

519
00:28:01,625 --> 00:28:03,261
And I know the first one is that

520
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:06,268
this is your first time off the desk. Isn't it?

521
00:28:06,924 --> 00:28:08,368
You should have said something to him.

522
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:10,629
This is a weird way for you to find out.

523
00:28:10,725 --> 00:28:12,532
You are literally
begging to be arrested. You know that?

524
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:14,965
If it means you would
actually do it, then, yeah. But you won't.

525
00:28:15,091 --> 00:28:18,694
Because if you did, it means that you,
and the FBI, and your friends at Interpol,

526
00:28:18,792 --> 00:28:22,108
actually believe,
at an institutional level, in magic.

527
00:28:23,324 --> 00:28:24,959
The press would have a field day.

528
00:28:25,158 --> 00:28:26,966
And we'd be even more famous
than we already are.

529
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:29,528
And you guys would look like idiots
even more then you already are.

530
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:31,703
Well, no, not you. But him. Right?

531
00:28:31,858 --> 00:28:35,258
You have, what we in the business,
like to call, "nothing up your sleeve."

532
00:28:35,458 --> 00:28:36,487
And you know it.

533
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:38,728
Don't draw him in and then dump him

534
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,642
because abandonment
is a big "area" for him.

535
00:28:42,825 --> 00:28:43,285
Mommy?

536
00:28:44,658 --> 00:28:45,118
Daddy.

537
00:28:46,092 --> 00:28:47,558
You have big daddy issues.

538
00:28:47,758 --> 00:28:49,259
- Okay, that's enough.
- I'll tell you what.

539
00:28:49,392 --> 00:28:52,631
Your average therapist is gonna charge you
$200-$300 for this sesh.

540
00:28:52,758 --> 00:28:54,247
Me? I'll take a tenner.

541
00:28:55,591 --> 00:28:58,269
Okay, later, if you're feeling magnanimous,

542
00:28:58,758 --> 00:29:00,367
I'll still take a tenner.

543
00:29:00,858 --> 00:29:02,892
You wanna know who sat
in that chair before you?

544
00:29:03,092 --> 00:29:05,192
Mob bosses, murderers, and thieves.

545
00:29:05,392 --> 00:29:06,801
And you know who put them there?

546
00:29:06,892 --> 00:29:08,801
The guy who's sitting in this chair.

547
00:29:08,892 --> 00:29:12,059
So I warn you,
I can maintain my resolve much longer

548
00:29:12,925 --> 00:29:15,593
than you can maintain
that phony arrogance.

549
00:29:15,826 --> 00:29:17,904
And the instant that you even show

550
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:21,762
the slightest crack in that smug facade,
I'll be there.

551
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:23,728
I will be all over you like...

552
00:29:23,826 --> 00:29:25,034
Like white on rice?

553
00:29:25,292 --> 00:29:26,681
Sorry. That's unfair.

554
00:29:26,959 --> 00:29:27,936
Let me warn you.

555
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:29,192
I want you to follow.

556
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:30,699
Because no matter
what you think you might know,

557
00:29:30,793 --> 00:29:33,426
we will always be one step, three steps,
seven steps ahead of you.

558
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:36,202
And just when you think you're catching up,
that's when we'll be right behind you.

559
00:29:36,292 --> 00:29:38,895
And at no time will you be anywhere other
than exactly where I want you to be.

560
00:29:38,993 --> 00:29:42,068
So come close. Get all over me
because the closer you think you are,

561
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,535
the less you'll actually see.

562
00:29:43,626 --> 00:29:45,005
I'm gonna nail you...

563
00:29:49,093 --> 00:29:51,361
Something wrong with that soda, Miss?

564
00:29:59,726 --> 00:30:00,356
Oh! Shit!

565
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,828
First rule of magic.

566
00:30:03,893 --> 00:30:06,261
Always be the smartest guy in the room.

567
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,961
Boss, what are we doing?
We're letting them go?

568
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,195
They all but admitted
they're gonna do it again.

569
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:30,293
About a half an hour ago,
you didn't give a damn about them.

570
00:30:30,393 --> 00:30:32,121
- What changed?
- I met them.

571
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:32,950
Hey. Guys.

572
00:30:33,493 --> 00:30:35,621
Hey, I ran a check on the audience.

573
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:37,229
Most of it was just filler.

574
00:30:37,326 --> 00:30:38,998
People that Tressler
dragged in to pack the room.

575
00:30:39,094 --> 00:30:42,097
But guess who was sitting there in the back,
filming the whole damn thing?

576
00:30:42,227 --> 00:30:43,136
I don't know.

577
00:30:43,326 --> 00:30:44,435
Thaddeus Bradley.

578
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,797
Thaddeus Bradley,
the guy from TV with the DVDs and shows?

579
00:30:47,927 --> 00:30:48,207
No.

580
00:30:48,994 --> 00:30:51,032
Okay, well, he debunks magicians.

581
00:30:51,393 --> 00:30:53,235
He exposes them.
He shows you how to do their tricks.

582
00:30:53,327 --> 00:30:54,396
Get him on the phone.

583
00:30:54,493 --> 00:30:56,130
I did. You're having lunch with him in 45.

584
00:30:56,261 --> 00:30:56,660
Good.

585
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,095
So you were a magician first?

586
00:30:59,227 --> 00:31:01,136
What made you jump over to this side?

587
00:31:01,227 --> 00:31:04,535
Do you know how many people went
to see magic performed live

588
00:31:04,627 --> 00:31:06,126
in the last half decade?

589
00:31:07,161 --> 00:31:08,370
About 1.6 million.

590
00:31:08,628 --> 00:31:12,384
You know how many digital downloads
I sold in the same period?

591
00:31:15,428 --> 00:31:16,297
Five million.

592
00:31:16,794 --> 00:31:18,523
Isn't there a cost, though?

593
00:31:19,927 --> 00:31:20,507
Careers.

594
00:31:21,494 --> 00:31:22,243
Even lives.

595
00:31:22,828 --> 00:31:25,032
I assume you're referring to Lionel Shrike.

596
00:31:25,161 --> 00:31:26,650
I'm sorry, who's that?

597
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:28,523
Lionel Shrike.

598
00:31:29,494 --> 00:31:31,702
A middling magician. A fool, really,

599
00:31:32,961 --> 00:31:35,948
who tried to make a name
for himself in the '70s.

600
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:38,752
My first show, I revealed all of his tricks.

601
00:31:39,095 --> 00:31:42,231
Exposed him
for the two-bit hustler that he really was.

602
00:31:42,327 --> 00:31:44,761
A year later, he tried to stage a comeback.

603
00:31:44,961 --> 00:31:46,749
Had himself locked in a safe,

604
00:31:47,828 --> 00:31:50,485
and dropped to the bottom of the East River.

605
00:31:51,995 --> 00:31:53,503
But he never resurfaced.

606
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,234
The guy died in there?

607
00:31:55,328 --> 00:31:57,126
The safe was never recovered.

608
00:31:57,494 --> 00:31:59,131
Must have been great for ratings.

609
00:31:59,228 --> 00:32:01,761
He attempted something
he was ill-prepared to handle.

610
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,802
You're about to do the same thing.

611
00:32:03,895 --> 00:32:06,373
But I assure you, Vegas was just a start.

612
00:32:07,594 --> 00:32:11,368
New Orleans will be to draw you in
so you think you know their routine.

613
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:14,399
All the while, setting you
up for the big punch,

614
00:32:16,328 --> 00:32:17,487
show number three.

615
00:32:17,961 --> 00:32:21,428
What makes you so certain
New Orleans is their next play?

616
00:32:22,429 --> 00:32:22,828
What?

617
00:32:25,562 --> 00:32:27,820
Flyer they passed out after the show.

618
00:32:28,228 --> 00:32:30,596
You, my friend, are going to be played.

619
00:32:30,928 --> 00:32:34,285
And your pathetic attempts
at fawning to gain my trust,

620
00:32:34,429 --> 00:32:37,246
only show how really
far out of depth you are.

621
00:32:38,095 --> 00:32:39,534
Okay. Here's the deal.

622
00:32:39,829 --> 00:32:41,607
You're great at what you do.

623
00:32:42,262 --> 00:32:43,706
We're trying to nail the same guys.

624
00:32:43,796 --> 00:32:45,794
So why don't you give us a hand?

625
00:32:50,829 --> 00:32:52,377
Now, why would I do that?

626
00:32:53,229 --> 00:32:55,197
The longer you spin your wheels,

627
00:32:56,129 --> 00:32:57,507
the more money I make.

628
00:32:58,096 --> 00:33:02,709
How about I drag you in right now on
obstruction charges and force you to tell me?

629
00:33:03,163 --> 00:33:05,266
Unless what you're actually
really trying to say is,

630
00:33:05,396 --> 00:33:07,863
you don't have any idea how they did it.

631
00:33:12,629 --> 00:33:14,268
Showmanship and theatrics.

632
00:33:14,996 --> 00:33:18,896
When a magician waves his hand and says,
"This is where the magic is happening."

633
00:33:19,096 --> 00:33:21,714
The real trick is happening somewhere else.

634
00:33:21,996 --> 00:33:24,384
Misdirection. A basic concept of magic.

635
00:33:25,163 --> 00:33:27,430
Not interested in the concepts of magic.

636
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,107
I wanna know how they robbed a bank.

637
00:33:29,296 --> 00:33:32,029
You're an idiot if you think
they robbed a bank.

638
00:33:32,229 --> 00:33:33,797
But don't take my word for it.

639
00:33:33,996 --> 00:33:35,605
How about a trip to Paris?

640
00:33:36,129 --> 00:33:39,226
Hermia,
the teleportation helmet, please, darling?

641
00:33:39,797 --> 00:33:41,096
You're joking, right?

642
00:33:41,296 --> 00:33:43,594
You wanna know how they did it or not?

643
00:33:44,263 --> 00:33:46,561
I'm just gonna put this on your head.

644
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:51,089
Step right UP There you go.

645
00:33:52,596 --> 00:33:55,353
Now we just pull this down
all safe and snug.

646
00:33:57,296 --> 00:33:59,684
Make yourself comfortable. There we go.

647
00:34:00,297 --> 00:34:02,399
And when you're ready to go to Paris,

648
00:34:02,496 --> 00:34:03,995
just say the magic word.

649
00:34:04,897 --> 00:34:05,466
Blow me?

650
00:34:07,064 --> 00:34:09,032
- That'll suffice.
- Bon voyage.

651
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:23,727
I personally prefer to take the stairs to Paris.

652
00:34:24,631 --> 00:34:26,564
Welcome to the City of Light, Agent Rhodes.

653
00:34:26,763 --> 00:34:28,731
Hardy har har. What was with the helmet?

654
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:29,440
My fun.

655
00:34:31,464 --> 00:34:31,863
What?

656
00:34:32,798 --> 00:34:33,377
Nothing.

657
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:37,067
So they got a vault set.

658
00:34:37,164 --> 00:34:37,504
Yes.

659
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:40,633
And it's the exact replica
of the little French guy's bank.

660
00:34:40,764 --> 00:34:41,764
So he's a plant.

661
00:34:41,864 --> 00:34:43,307
He was a dupe, not a plant.

662
00:34:43,397 --> 00:34:45,831
They chose him. They knew
which seat he was in.

663
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:48,518
No, no, no, the audience picked the seat.

664
00:34:49,065 --> 00:34:51,838
Unless, of course,
the audience didn't pick the seat.

665
00:34:51,931 --> 00:34:53,966
They let them think they picked the seat.

666
00:34:54,065 --> 00:34:55,764
We'll choose one at random then.

667
00:34:55,964 --> 00:34:59,898
Actually, they were just palming the ball
with the seat number they wanted.

668
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,905
We are looking at row number 5.

669
00:35:02,098 --> 00:35:03,731
Henley, could I please
have a seat number?

670
00:35:03,931 --> 00:35:04,908
Lucky number 13.

671
00:35:04,998 --> 00:35:07,033
Could you just confirm that this
is, in fact, your seat?

672
00:35:07,131 --> 00:35:08,170
He was selected.

673
00:35:09,464 --> 00:35:11,499
They programmed his mind
to make him go to Las Vegas.

674
00:35:11,597 --> 00:35:12,576
Viva Las Vegas.

675
00:35:13,831 --> 00:35:16,778
And then
they kept reinforcing it, until he did.

676
00:35:18,098 --> 00:35:19,197
They trailed him.

677
00:35:19,432 --> 00:35:20,531
They studied him.

678
00:35:20,631 --> 00:35:22,310
Nothing was left to chance.

679
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:25,664
I got his measurements.

680
00:35:25,764 --> 00:35:27,892
He had no idea he was their target.

681
00:35:28,265 --> 00:35:30,334
And they simply activated him in Vegas.

682
00:35:30,532 --> 00:35:31,764
When I snap my fingers...

683
00:35:31,964 --> 00:35:34,002
And once again, Merritt McKinney.

684
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:35,765
But how did they know what bank was his?

685
00:35:35,964 --> 00:35:37,098
- You're kidding.
- Really?

686
00:35:37,298 --> 00:35:39,833
Can you be any more
of a condescending ass?

687
00:35:39,931 --> 00:35:40,271
Yes.

688
00:35:41,698 --> 00:35:42,387
Like this.

689
00:35:43,865 --> 00:35:46,352
There's a very rare, very mysterious way

690
00:35:47,231 --> 00:35:50,588
in which a magician divines
an audience member's bank.

691
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:52,421
You ready?

692
00:35:53,165 --> 00:35:53,505
Yes.

693
00:35:55,066 --> 00:35:55,875
Credit card.

694
00:35:56,832 --> 00:35:59,639
And that's how they got
the signature for the card

695
00:35:59,732 --> 00:36:01,676
they left in the vault in Paris.

696
00:36:01,799 --> 00:36:02,488
Very good.

697
00:36:03,032 --> 00:36:04,599
You're being one-upped, Agent Rhodes.

698
00:36:04,799 --> 00:36:07,606
Okay, but they had to get
the signature card in the vault.

699
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:09,299
You said they didn't steal the money.

700
00:36:09,498 --> 00:36:10,999
No, I didn't say they didn't steal the money.

701
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:13,107
I said they didn't rob the bank.

702
00:36:13,698 --> 00:36:17,402
My guess is that they targeted
a shipment of freshly minted money

703
00:36:17,498 --> 00:36:21,085
headed to the Frenchman's bank
on-board an armored truck.

704
00:36:22,832 --> 00:36:25,605
Which, of course,
is just as hard to break into.

705
00:36:25,732 --> 00:36:27,591
Unless you're already inside.

706
00:36:44,066 --> 00:36:47,101
And despite what the banks
would have you believe,

707
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:50,906
the men who drive
these trucks are not exactly mental giants.

708
00:36:51,733 --> 00:36:52,952
For our Horsemen...

709
00:36:53,366 --> 00:36:54,985
...it was almost too easy.

710
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,589
Hey, boys-

711
00:37:09,433 --> 00:37:13,234
So, how did they make the phony money
disappear from the vault?

712
00:37:13,433 --> 00:37:14,243
Flash paper.

713
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,948
Magicians use it all the time.

714
00:37:24,499 --> 00:37:26,707
Creates no smoke, leaves no residue.

715
00:37:32,699 --> 00:37:35,041
Two days ago, no one heard of these guys,

716
00:37:35,233 --> 00:37:37,801
but tonight's show sold out in 35 seconds.

717
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:40,344
I think these guys have cracked
the secret to show business.

718
00:37:40,434 --> 00:37:42,292
Give your audience $3 million.

719
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,742
Puts 'em in a good mood, doesn't it?

720
00:37:44,833 --> 00:37:45,932
Best finale ever.

721
00:37:46,133 --> 00:37:48,577
They're gonna be
the first magicians in history to get laid.

722
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:51,104
Remember, if the oxygen mask comes down,

723
00:37:51,233 --> 00:37:53,233
- put it on the lawyer first. Remember.
- Oh, yes.

724
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:55,291
I always do. It's lawyer first,

725
00:37:55,767 --> 00:37:57,802
- then myself and then the children.
- Then yourself.

726
00:37:57,901 --> 00:37:59,349
Yes. Then the children.

727
00:37:59,734 --> 00:38:01,712
We'll be getting there a few minutes early.

728
00:38:01,801 --> 00:38:02,904
So, sit back, relax.

729
00:38:03,001 --> 00:38:04,740
We should be in the Big Easy soon.

730
00:38:04,834 --> 00:38:06,505
Appreciate you flying with us today.

731
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,908
So, what's in it
for Tressler, besides the money?

732
00:38:09,068 --> 00:38:09,407
Ego.

733
00:38:11,901 --> 00:38:13,230
Okay, pick your card.

734
00:38:14,134 --> 00:38:16,601
Look at it, put it in the deck, and tell me.

735
00:38:16,801 --> 00:38:18,000
No, don't tell me.

736
00:38:18,634 --> 00:38:21,910
.Okay-.Okay- Thaddeus was there that night.

737
00:38:22,001 --> 00:38:24,411
He knows exactly
how they pulled it off. What about him?

738
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,172
You think they could be working together.

739
00:38:26,268 --> 00:38:28,468
Like there's another
Horseman or something.

740
00:38:28,667 --> 00:38:31,676
I don't know. All I know is that these guys
were a bunch of street magicians

741
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:33,336
a year ago with no resources.

742
00:38:33,435 --> 00:38:37,404
So, how do they go from doing that to this
without some kind of outside help?

743
00:38:37,501 --> 00:38:38,650
Is this your card?

744
00:38:38,901 --> 00:38:42,118
No, my card is sitting
over there in that guy's lap.

745
00:38:42,368 --> 00:38:43,237
Nice shuffle.

746
00:38:44,334 --> 00:38:47,369
Allow me to make plain
what we've both been thinking.

747
00:38:47,501 --> 00:38:48,590
And what's that?

748
00:38:48,768 --> 00:38:51,837
Well, obviously, you have feelings
of affection for Daniel.

749
00:38:51,934 --> 00:38:53,513
Unrequited and misguided,

750
00:38:54,168 --> 00:38:56,846
owing to his lack of emotional availability.

751
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:59,379
Consequently, you're very tightly...

752
00:38:59,868 --> 00:39:01,126
How should I put it?

753
00:39:02,068 --> 00:39:02,588
Corked.

754
00:39:03,134 --> 00:39:03,754
Oh, I am?

755
00:39:04,234 --> 00:39:07,838
Now, recognizing that
you have physical needs not being met,

756
00:39:07,935 --> 00:39:10,538
and strictly in the vein of
helping a sister out,

757
00:39:10,635 --> 00:39:14,211
I invite you to think
of me as your own personal corkscrew.

758
00:39:15,568 --> 00:39:16,377
Wow. Thanks.

759
00:39:16,768 --> 00:39:19,541
Let me mull over
that offer of cheap and meaningless sex.

760
00:39:19,635 --> 00:39:22,952
Cheap and meaningless, maybe,
but not time-consuming.

761
00:39:26,335 --> 00:39:28,404
Is it magicians, in general,
you have a problem with?

762
00:39:28,501 --> 00:39:30,190
Or specifically those guys?

763
00:39:31,501 --> 00:39:34,070
I could careless about magicians in general.

764
00:39:34,169 --> 00:39:37,010
What I hate is people
who exploit other people.

765
00:39:37,102 --> 00:39:38,201
Exploit them how?

766
00:39:38,302 --> 00:39:38,991
Try again.

767
00:39:40,735 --> 00:39:42,645
By taking advantage of their weaknesses.

768
00:39:42,768 --> 00:39:45,508
Their need
to believe in something that's unexplainable

769
00:39:45,602 --> 00:39:48,209
in order to make their lives more bearable.

770
00:39:48,669 --> 00:39:50,097
I see it as a strength.

771
00:39:50,436 --> 00:39:52,804
My life is happier when I believe that.

772
00:39:53,402 --> 00:39:54,551
Is this your card?

773
00:39:55,968 --> 00:39:56,368
Yeah.

774
00:39:57,935 --> 00:39:58,335
Yeah?

775
00:39:59,069 --> 00:39:59,988
- Yeah.
- Cool.

776
00:40:03,002 --> 00:40:05,190
That smile on your face. Is it real?

777
00:40:06,469 --> 00:40:06,929
Maybe.

778
00:40:08,169 --> 00:40:10,417
So let me ask you, Mr. Detective Man.

779
00:40:10,669 --> 00:40:12,058
Do you feel exploited?

780
00:40:12,169 --> 00:40:14,977
Or did you have maybe
a tiny, tiny bit of fun?

781
00:40:17,669 --> 00:40:18,908
Guy goes to the doctor.

782
00:40:19,003 --> 00:40:21,205
Doctor says, "Sir, you're gonna
"have to stop masturbating."

783
00:40:21,302 --> 00:40:22,279
He says, "Why?"

784
00:40:22,369 --> 00:40:23,813
He says, "So I can finish the examination."

785
00:40:23,903 --> 00:40:24,972
Oh, Danny, can I talk to you about

786
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:26,604
- my role in the show real quick?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

787
00:40:26,702 --> 00:40:27,391
Hey' guys.

788
00:40:28,402 --> 00:40:29,812
We got a show to prepare for.

789
00:40:29,936 --> 00:40:30,615
Do we now?

790
00:40:32,336 --> 00:40:33,370
No, no, no, don't do that.

791
00:40:33,469 --> 00:40:34,606
You're not doing that thing to me. No.

792
00:40:34,736 --> 00:40:36,043
What thing? I'm just looking at you.

793
00:40:36,136 --> 00:40:37,704
No, you're not.
I've been watching you for a year.

794
00:40:37,803 --> 00:40:39,145
I know all of your little tricks.

795
00:40:39,236 --> 00:40:40,373
That what they are to you? Tricks?

796
00:40:40,503 --> 00:40:42,208
Yes, it's gimmicks. It's Barnum statements.

797
00:40:42,303 --> 00:40:43,974
It's reading the eyes. Body language. I get it.

798
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:45,741
If it's such an easy thing,
why don't you do Henley?

799
00:40:45,836 --> 00:40:47,576
Yeah, Danny. Why don't you do me?

800
00:40:47,669 --> 00:40:49,806
No, you're too easy. I'll do Jasmine.

801
00:40:49,903 --> 00:40:50,183
No.

802
00:40:51,736 --> 00:40:52,186
Do me.

803
00:40:52,836 --> 00:40:54,246
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Do Art.

804
00:40:54,336 --> 00:40:54,736
Okay.

805
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:56,279
Even better.

806
00:40:56,603 --> 00:40:57,462
- Art.
- Yeah.

807
00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:00,537
But I warn you, I can be difficult to read,
when I want to be.

808
00:41:00,637 --> 00:41:02,135
Just stay with me, okay?

809
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:05,308
So, Art, you were a tough kid.

810
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,470
You know, kind of a real rapscallion.

811
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:09,514
You had a dog. A real tough dog.

812
00:41:09,603 --> 00:41:11,478
A brutish breed. Like a real...

813
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:13,468
I want to say, Ben the bulldog.

814
00:41:13,837 --> 00:41:16,035
Actually, I was a prissy little tot.

815
00:41:16,336 --> 00:41:18,824
I had a fluffy white cat called Snuffles.

816
00:41:20,970 --> 00:41:21,429
Sorry.

817
00:41:22,437 --> 00:41:23,540
Wait, let me try one.

818
00:41:23,637 --> 00:41:24,706
- I can do way better than that.
- Let him do it.

819
00:41:24,804 --> 00:41:25,873
Come on, give me
one more time. One more time.

820
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:27,538
He can do way better than that.

821
00:41:27,637 --> 00:41:28,614
Let's do family.

822
00:41:28,737 --> 00:41:31,155
You had an uncle on your mother's side.

823
00:41:32,071 --> 00:41:34,674
He had a real, kind of...
A real masculine name.

824
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:36,975
A real, kind of, salt-of-the-earth...

825
00:41:37,071 --> 00:41:38,571
You know, a real stick-it-to-you...

826
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:42,127
Like it was some kind of Paul.
Thompson? Was it a Paul...

827
00:41:43,004 --> 00:41:44,539
Okay. You know what? I got nothin'.

828
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,148
- Nearly though.
- Was I?

829
00:41:46,271 --> 00:41:48,988
Yeah. My uncle's name
was Cushman Armitage.

830
00:41:49,837 --> 00:41:51,372
Really? Snuffles and Cushman Armitage?

831
00:41:51,471 --> 00:41:52,471
That was your childhood?

832
00:41:52,604 --> 00:41:55,638
I certainly hope
tonight's show is gonna be better than this.

833
00:41:55,837 --> 00:41:57,566
Don't worry. Just you wait.

834
00:42:03,237 --> 00:42:06,340
Hey. Come on, give me some good news
on a hotel room, please.

835
00:42:06,438 --> 00:42:07,541
What, are you kidding me?

836
00:42:07,638 --> 00:42:09,138
No, it's Mardi Gras, Dylan.

837
00:42:09,271 --> 00:42:11,180
There's nothing within sight of the theater.

838
00:42:11,271 --> 00:42:14,148
Hold on a second. Hold on.
Where is this woman?

839
00:42:15,504 --> 00:42:17,003
Hey, hey! There you are.

840
00:42:17,738 --> 00:42:20,237
What, the French girl doing a little
sightseeing while she's in New Orleans?

841
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:22,425
No. In fact, here, speaking French

842
00:42:22,638 --> 00:42:23,967
is actually an asset.

843
00:42:24,438 --> 00:42:26,336
Do you see that woman up there?

844
00:42:26,971 --> 00:42:28,074
That's Marie Claire.

845
00:42:28,172 --> 00:42:30,479
And she has a lovely apartment for us.

846
00:42:32,738 --> 00:42:33,777
You're welcome.

847
00:42:34,438 --> 00:42:34,838
Yeah.

848
00:42:35,805 --> 00:42:36,774
We got a place.

849
00:42:39,571 --> 00:42:41,405
This other guy, Maximillian...

850
00:42:41,604 --> 00:42:44,705
I am not interested in a history lesson
on magic at this moment.

851
00:42:44,905 --> 00:42:47,383
If you want to keep playing
into their hands, go for it.

852
00:42:47,472 --> 00:42:49,381
I'm just
trying to understand how they think.

853
00:42:49,472 --> 00:42:51,676
You think I'm playing
in their hands, do you?

854
00:42:51,771 --> 00:42:54,545
I don't know how any of that
is gonna go against this.

855
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:56,027
This what? This magic?

856
00:42:58,272 --> 00:42:59,201
Lionel Shrike.

857
00:42:59,805 --> 00:43:03,072
In Central Park,
he has a guy pick a card and sign it.

858
00:43:03,405 --> 00:43:06,405
Then he goes to a tree
that has been there 20 years.

859
00:43:06,605 --> 00:43:07,980
They saw the tree in half.

860
00:43:08,072 --> 00:43:10,141
Inside the tree, encased in glass,

861
00:43:10,272 --> 00:43:12,079
is the card with the signature.

862
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,275
How did he do that?

863
00:43:13,372 --> 00:43:17,058
I have no idea.
But I'm sure there's a logical explanation.

864
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,381
You guys got a guy in that lobby yet?

865
00:43:21,472 --> 00:43:23,039
No, but I do have some good news.

866
00:43:23,238 --> 00:43:25,216
Remember how Atlas is such a control freak,

867
00:43:25,305 --> 00:43:27,045
he's got his whole crew
on those tracking bracelets?

868
00:43:27,139 --> 00:43:28,411
What tracking bracelets?

869
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:31,407
He has every member of his crew
wearing a tracking bracelet.

870
00:43:31,505 --> 00:43:33,574
Those bracelets are on a sub-8 flat-band.

871
00:43:33,672 --> 00:43:34,809
So as long as Atlas is tracking them...

872
00:43:34,906 --> 00:43:35,305
Next.

873
00:43:36,106 --> 00:43:38,682
...our boys can track Atlas
from right here in the mobile command unit.

874
00:43:38,772 --> 00:43:40,716
Okay, call me if you get any movement.

875
00:43:40,806 --> 00:43:41,495
Copy that.

876
00:43:50,939 --> 00:43:53,606
You are missing the big picture here, Dylan.

877
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:57,117
There is a place in Paris, Pont des Arts.

878
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:01,437
Sometimes in the mornings
I sit on a bench there.

879
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:06,475
And I watch the people make a wish
and lock it in a lock on the bridge.

880
00:44:06,573 --> 00:44:08,651
Then throw the key into the Seine.

881
00:44:11,073 --> 00:44:13,960
All day they do this.
Mothers, lovers, old men.

882
00:44:15,907 --> 00:44:17,885
Watching the key sink into the water

883
00:44:17,972 --> 00:44:20,410
and their secret is locked away forever.

884
00:44:22,106 --> 00:44:24,304
Real and, at the same time, magical.

885
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:38,302
So, do you really think it's
possible there's a fifth Horseman?

886
00:44:39,740 --> 00:44:40,140
Yeah.

887
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,316
There is a legend of a secret order

888
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:52,463
born in ancient Egypt called "The Eye."

889
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:57,218
It is said they perfected sleight of hand

890
00:44:57,307 --> 00:44:59,215
to steal food from the Pharaohs

891
00:44:59,474 --> 00:45:01,082
and give it to the slaves.

892
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:02,570
Their purpose?

893
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:06,297
Using magic
and illusion to even the scales of justice.

894
00:45:07,807 --> 00:45:11,843
Are The Horsemen next in a long line
of fools to believe this myth?

895
00:45:12,507 --> 00:45:16,713
Will they evade the rules of law and logic
like they did in Las Vegas?

896
00:45:18,074 --> 00:45:21,321
Or will the dark mysticism
of this Southern swampland

897
00:45:22,908 --> 00:45:24,346
get the better of them?

898
00:45:30,941 --> 00:45:32,159
Bravo, Mr. Bradley.

899
00:45:32,607 --> 00:45:34,585
Either you have a cease-and-desist,

900
00:45:34,674 --> 00:45:36,975
which you don't, or you should leave.

901
00:45:37,174 --> 00:45:39,542
If I want something to cease or desist,

902
00:45:42,108 --> 00:45:42,677
it does.

903
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:44,164
Take five.

904
00:45:44,974 --> 00:45:46,774
According to your potential backers,

905
00:45:46,974 --> 00:45:49,102
you stand to make 2.5 million tops

906
00:45:50,774 --> 00:45:52,223
from your best special.

907
00:45:52,507 --> 00:45:53,706
I have here a check

908
00:45:56,941 --> 00:45:58,030
for 3.5 million.

909
00:45:58,408 --> 00:45:59,267
To walk away?

910
00:45:59,574 --> 00:46:01,992
To fly away. My jet is at your disposal.

911
00:46:05,408 --> 00:46:07,785
Let's not kid ourselves, Mr. Tressler.

912
00:46:09,675 --> 00:46:11,623
You're in this to ride them up.

913
00:46:12,275 --> 00:46:14,043
I'm in it to ride them down.

914
00:46:14,575 --> 00:46:16,802
I take it that we do not have a deal.

915
00:46:19,108 --> 00:46:20,966
And therein lies our conflict.

916
00:46:26,842 --> 00:46:27,871
Let me be blunt.

917
00:46:28,508 --> 00:46:31,455
My bank account
is much, much bigger than yours.

918
00:46:33,175 --> 00:46:35,203
And my lawyers are much stronger.

919
00:46:36,341 --> 00:46:37,900
And they will manacle you

920
00:46:40,675 --> 00:46:42,243
with so many injunctions.

921
00:46:42,775 --> 00:46:45,014
Until you stand by, hopelessly watching

922
00:46:45,109 --> 00:46:47,197
everything that you own drain away

923
00:46:48,608 --> 00:46:50,806
in front of your greedy little eyes.

924
00:46:51,176 --> 00:46:53,575
This isn't the first time I've been threatened.

925
00:46:53,775 --> 00:46:57,471
It is, however,
the first time you've been threatened by me.

926
00:46:59,975 --> 00:47:01,823
You shouldn't have done that.

927
00:47:03,409 --> 00:47:04,976
According to superstition,

928
00:47:05,176 --> 00:47:07,983
one who uses a doll
to enact one's own wrath,

929
00:47:08,276 --> 00:47:11,223
is likely to bring that
very wrath unto himself.

930
00:47:13,576 --> 00:47:14,724
Isn't that funny?

931
00:47:15,909 --> 00:47:18,507
And I thought you didn't believe in magic.

932
00:47:23,909 --> 00:47:26,985
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Savoy management welcomes you

933
00:47:27,109 --> 00:47:30,521
to tonight's special performance,
The Four Horsemen, Act Two.

934
00:47:31,643 --> 00:47:33,610
Unlike traditional performances,

935
00:47:33,810 --> 00:47:37,020
The Four Horsemen encourage you to film,
call your friends,

936
00:47:37,109 --> 00:47:39,667
upload, stream, and tweet the show freely.

937
00:47:40,276 --> 00:47:43,213
Thank you. The show
will begin in a few minutes.

938
00:47:46,342 --> 00:47:48,810
By the way, I know how he did that trick.

939
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:50,989
- Who?
- Shrike.

940
00:47:52,243 --> 00:47:53,441
So, when he was 14,

941
00:47:54,277 --> 00:47:56,576
he saw a hole in a tree in Central Park.

942
00:47:56,776 --> 00:47:59,134
He had a guy who worked at the carousel

943
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:03,583
sign a card for what looked
like a routine little trick.

944
00:48:04,277 --> 00:48:06,764
At the guy's retirement, 18 years later,

945
00:48:08,477 --> 00:48:12,593
Shrike performs, has the guy sign a card,
and presto!

946
00:48:13,743 --> 00:48:15,050
The card is in the tree.

947
00:48:15,143 --> 00:48:16,984
It was in the tree for 18 years.

948
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:18,144
The card was in the tree.

949
00:48:18,243 --> 00:48:21,221
The tree grew around the card in 18 years.
That's not magic.

950
00:48:21,343 --> 00:48:24,110
The point is, the trick
was not to look closely.

951
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:25,619
It was to look so far

952
00:48:26,310 --> 00:48:28,498
that you see 20 years into the past.

953
00:48:29,177 --> 00:48:32,134
After Shrike drowned,
they never found the body.

954
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:34,118
What are you suggesting?

955
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:42,206
Arthur Tressler presents Jack Wilder,
Henley Reeves,

956
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:43,619
Merritt McKinney,

957
00:48:44,044 --> 00:48:45,142
and Daniel Atlas.

958
00:48:45,811 --> 00:48:46,970
The Four Horsemen.

959
00:48:52,944 --> 00:48:53,863
What is magic?

960
00:48:54,944 --> 00:48:57,741
Our argument,
nothing but targeted deception.

961
00:48:59,178 --> 00:49:00,546
So I want you to look.

962
00:49:01,144 --> 00:49:02,882
Look as closely as possible.

963
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:05,644
Because the tricks you are about to see

964
00:49:05,844 --> 00:49:07,293
may not seem connected.

965
00:49:07,644 --> 00:49:09,373
But we assure you, they are.

966
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:12,778
Is what follows 100 different tricks?

967
00:49:13,644 --> 00:49:15,373
Or is it one giant illusion?

968
00:49:24,911 --> 00:49:27,889
And now for one
of the oldest tricks in the book.

969
00:49:28,044 --> 00:49:30,181
Danny, if you wouldn't mind
opening up the box,

970
00:49:30,278 --> 00:49:32,511
and showing everybody
that it's completely empty.

971
00:49:32,711 --> 00:49:35,668
Now, we're gonna need
12 courageous volunteers.

972
00:49:36,944 --> 00:49:39,183
I'm gonna take sweet little Fluffy here,

973
00:49:39,278 --> 00:49:41,476
and put her inside this mystery box.

974
00:49:42,511 --> 00:49:44,182
There are two pencils out there.

975
00:49:44,311 --> 00:49:45,550
Hold 'em up high. Let me see 'em.

976
00:49:45,645 --> 00:49:46,564
- Here!
- Yeah!

977
00:49:47,545 --> 00:49:49,523
And now, you will say the magic word.

978
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:50,430
Abracadabra.

979
00:49:50,945 --> 00:49:53,947
Yes, and I will wave this magic wand
for no reason. And then...

980
00:49:54,045 --> 00:49:57,241
Fluffy has
magically vanished before your very eyes.

981
00:49:58,045 --> 00:50:00,250
If you haven't experienced mass hypnosis,

982
00:50:00,344 --> 00:50:01,433
you're about to.

983
00:50:01,778 --> 00:50:02,467
And sleep.

984
00:50:02,945 --> 00:50:05,622
Down, down. Sleep, sleep.
Completely sleep.

985
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:07,446
Good, good. Sleep, sleep.

986
00:50:07,545 --> 00:50:09,214
And now we are gonna debunk

987
00:50:09,645 --> 00:50:11,553
a few magic myths this evening.

988
00:50:11,845 --> 00:50:15,012
We all know that Fluffy is,
in fact, alive and well.

989
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:17,589
And Fluffy has miraculously appeared.

990
00:50:17,945 --> 00:50:21,955
As has the mirror which makes the box
only appear as though it's empty.

991
00:50:22,045 --> 00:50:23,953
When you hear the word "freeze"

992
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:26,110
you are all football players.

993
00:50:27,045 --> 00:50:31,672
And your job is to tackle, dismantle, crush,

994
00:50:32,479 --> 00:50:33,748
tear limb from limb,

995
00:50:35,179 --> 00:50:36,228
the quarterback.

996
00:50:47,979 --> 00:50:50,236
You will know who the quarterback is.

997
00:50:50,512 --> 00:50:52,700
He will be the one saying that word.

998
00:50:54,145 --> 00:50:54,665
Freeze.

999
00:50:55,345 --> 00:50:56,504
Three, two, one...

1000
00:51:04,646 --> 00:51:06,590
Put your hands in the middle.
One, two, three...

1001
00:51:06,679 --> 00:51:08,018
Kill the quarterback!

1002
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:09,788
Get on back to your seats.

1003
00:51:10,013 --> 00:51:12,820
I got a feeling
I'm gonna be seeing you soon.

1004
00:51:44,547 --> 00:51:46,625
I guess you have lost some weight.

1005
00:52:01,713 --> 00:52:05,447
At the intermission, we asked you to
write down your current bank balance,

1006
00:52:05,647 --> 00:52:07,023
and seal it in an envelope.

1007
00:52:07,114 --> 00:52:08,682
Now it's time to take those envelopes out.

1008
00:52:08,814 --> 00:52:10,203
Everyone take 'em out.

1009
00:52:11,346 --> 00:52:15,195
Now, everybody,
shout out your name. All at once. Go.

1010
00:52:17,613 --> 00:52:18,532
Shout 'em out.

1011
00:52:21,214 --> 00:52:22,383
Clement? Frannick?

1012
00:52:23,347 --> 00:52:25,382
- Yeah! Up here!
- Oh. Way up there.

1013
00:52:25,481 --> 00:52:26,879
Okay. Dina? Robertson?

1014
00:52:27,647 --> 00:52:28,387
That's me!

1015
00:52:29,114 --> 00:52:30,962
Okay. Names. Names. Let's go.

1016
00:52:32,814 --> 00:52:33,803
Josepha Hickey?

1017
00:52:34,847 --> 00:52:35,587
That's me!

1018
00:52:35,947 --> 00:52:38,715
Josepha, I want you
to focus on your balance,

1019
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:40,947
and count from one to 10 out loud.

1020
00:52:41,147 --> 00:52:42,750
One, two, three, four, five...

1021
00:52:42,847 --> 00:52:43,247
Stop.

1022
00:52:44,381 --> 00:52:45,700
Is the first digit 5?

1023
00:52:46,214 --> 00:52:46,554
Yes.

1024
00:52:47,281 --> 00:52:48,588
Do it again. This time, faster.

1025
00:52:48,681 --> 00:52:50,090
One, two, three, four, five, six...

1026
00:52:50,181 --> 00:52:50,581
Stop.

1027
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:52,730
Six. Again.

1028
00:52:53,548 --> 00:52:54,297
One, two...

1029
00:52:54,781 --> 00:52:57,668
Josepha, is your
bank balance $562 as of today?

1030
00:52:58,948 --> 00:53:00,496
Yeah. That's what I got.

1031
00:53:02,848 --> 00:53:04,348
Unfortunately, you're wrong.

1032
00:53:04,548 --> 00:53:05,297
Okay, Dina.

1033
00:53:07,514 --> 00:53:11,101
1, 4, 7,

1034
00:53:12,848 --> 00:53:13,587
-7.
- Yeah.

1035
00:53:14,548 --> 00:53:17,595
You think it is.
But in fact, you, too, are wrong.

1036
00:53:18,381 --> 00:53:18,961
Clement.

1037
00:53:19,648 --> 00:53:22,066
You do not have $6,500 in your account.

1038
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:25,203
In fact, everybody stand up. Everybody.

1039
00:53:28,614 --> 00:53:31,172
Yeah. Put your envelopes to your forehead.

1040
00:53:32,881 --> 00:53:34,210
Focus on your number.

1041
00:53:38,615 --> 00:53:40,922
This is... Oh, dear. Just as I feared.

1042
00:53:41,815 --> 00:53:43,084
Oh, this is strange.

1043
00:53:44,382 --> 00:53:47,539
You know, I hate to say this,
but you're all wrong.

1044
00:53:47,782 --> 00:53:49,589
Every last one of you is dead wrong

1045
00:53:49,682 --> 00:53:51,785
about what you think is in your account.

1046
00:53:51,881 --> 00:53:53,550
Okay, you can sit down now.

1047
00:53:53,948 --> 00:53:55,337
Yeah. I almost forgot.

1048
00:53:56,348 --> 00:53:58,436
This evening would not be possible

1049
00:53:59,315 --> 00:54:02,732
if it weren't
for our great benefactor Arthur Tressler.

1050
00:54:04,348 --> 00:54:05,983
Big applause! Big applause!

1051
00:54:06,182 --> 00:54:08,594
Art, actually, why don't you come up on stage
for the finale?

1052
00:54:08,849 --> 00:54:10,622
- Come on down, Art!
- Come on down, Art!

1053
00:54:10,715 --> 00:54:12,333
There he goes. Okay, good.

1054
00:54:12,715 --> 00:54:13,624
Are we on red?

1055
00:54:13,849 --> 00:54:15,884
Bright red. We're all standing by.

1056
00:54:15,982 --> 00:54:17,425
All right, no one leaves the theater. No one.

1057
00:54:17,515 --> 00:54:18,434
There he goes.

1058
00:54:19,315 --> 00:54:21,486
Now, Art, did you fill out your envelope?

1059
00:54:21,582 --> 00:54:23,880
Well, no need. We've done it for you.

1060
00:54:24,083 --> 00:54:25,631
Now, Art, I took a guess.

1061
00:54:26,982 --> 00:54:28,530
North of 140. Am I right?

1062
00:54:30,316 --> 00:54:32,274
That's 140 million, by the way.

1063
00:54:36,582 --> 00:54:37,583
I'm sorry, Merritt.

1064
00:54:37,749 --> 00:54:40,885
How can he be right about his balance
and everyone else be wrong?

1065
00:54:41,049 --> 00:54:43,657
I think possibly because he, too, is wrong.

1066
00:54:44,616 --> 00:54:46,534
Everybody, take out your paper.

1067
00:54:46,882 --> 00:54:49,380
And using the flashlight under your seat,

1068
00:54:49,616 --> 00:54:51,344
start to warm up that paper.

1069
00:54:51,616 --> 00:54:54,453
I think your correct balance
begins to appear.

1070
00:54:58,383 --> 00:55:01,610
Now, Art, don't worry,
we have a flashlight for you.

1071
00:55:01,917 --> 00:55:02,256
Yes.

1072
00:55:09,716 --> 00:55:10,115
Look.

1073
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:13,256
What's going on there, Daniel?

1074
00:55:13,349 --> 00:55:16,096
Wait. This is weird. A second ago, it said
$144,519,651.

1075
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:19,639
But now...

1076
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:22,092
Now it says $70,000 less.

1077
00:55:26,783 --> 00:55:28,227
Josepha, can you stand up?

1078
00:55:28,317 --> 00:55:28,656
Yes.

1079
00:55:29,616 --> 00:55:31,351
Now, what is your new number?

1080
00:55:31,550 --> 00:55:33,219
$70,562 now in my account.

1081
00:55:39,017 --> 00:55:41,844
Is it possible that
Josepha's balance went up

1082
00:55:42,517 --> 00:55:44,586
the exact amount that Art's went down?

1083
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:47,204
Hey. Check it out. It's happening again.

1084
00:55:47,651 --> 00:55:48,100
Is it?

1085
00:55:50,084 --> 00:55:50,823
Wow. It is.

1086
00:55:52,751 --> 00:55:55,298
Art's balance has gone down another 280K.

1087
00:55:56,117 --> 00:55:58,184
Dina Robertson? What did yours say?

1088
00:55:58,384 --> 00:55:59,073
$281,411.

1089
00:56:05,983 --> 00:56:07,651
We have a confession to make.

1090
00:56:07,851 --> 00:56:09,829
She's right. We lied about something.

1091
00:56:09,918 --> 00:56:11,554
Yes. None of you were chosen at random.

1092
00:56:11,717 --> 00:56:13,905
All of you have one thing in common.

1093
00:56:14,684 --> 00:56:16,559
Everyone in this room was a victim

1094
00:56:16,651 --> 00:56:19,527
of the hard times that hit one of
America's most treasured cities.

1095
00:56:19,617 --> 00:56:22,045
Some of you lost your houses, your cars.

1096
00:56:22,651 --> 00:56:23,628
Your businesses.

1097
00:56:23,818 --> 00:56:24,795
Your loved ones.

1098
00:56:24,951 --> 00:56:27,888
But all of you were insured
by the same company.

1099
00:56:28,285 --> 00:56:29,513
Tressler Insurance.

1100
00:56:31,285 --> 00:56:32,421
You were abandoned.

1101
00:56:32,517 --> 00:56:33,586
You were loopholed...

1102
00:56:33,684 --> 00:56:35,373
...out of your settlements.

1103
00:56:36,251 --> 00:56:38,099
This is all for show. Correct?

1104
00:56:38,984 --> 00:56:41,618
"All" meaning we're doing it onstage
in front of a paying audience?

1105
00:56:41,818 --> 00:56:43,518
- Then, yes, it's for show.
- Whoa! Whoa!

1106
00:56:43,717 --> 00:56:46,015
I've got $82,000 in my bank account!

1107
00:56:46,385 --> 00:56:48,285
It says it right here on my cell phone!

1108
00:56:48,485 --> 00:56:51,971
Everybody, look at your
cell phones right now! Everybody!

1109
00:56:59,385 --> 00:57:00,385
Is this for real?

1110
00:57:00,585 --> 00:57:01,494
I don't know.

1111
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:03,120
Is this happening?

1112
00:57:03,318 --> 00:57:05,086
I don't know! I can't tell!

1113
00:57:05,652 --> 00:57:06,970
Hey! Did you do this?

1114
00:57:08,984 --> 00:57:10,133
How could we, Art?

1115
00:57:10,285 --> 00:57:11,585
We don't have your password.

1116
00:57:11,785 --> 00:57:15,051
We'd need access to information
we could never get our hands on.

1117
00:57:15,251 --> 00:57:18,953
Yes, security questions, for instance, like,
I don't know, your mother's maiden name

1118
00:57:19,086 --> 00:57:20,563
or the name of your first pet.

1119
00:57:20,652 --> 00:57:22,719
Where would we get that information, Art?

1120
00:57:22,919 --> 00:57:25,007
You certainly would never tell us.

1121
00:57:27,351 --> 00:57:31,068
We got confirmation.
It's really happening. They robbed him.

1122
00:57:31,785 --> 00:57:33,229
Do not let them get away.

1123
00:57:33,319 --> 00:57:35,676
Hey, we left you the jet and the Rolls.

1124
00:57:42,252 --> 00:57:43,510
You got hell to pay!

1125
00:57:46,585 --> 00:57:46,985
Stop!

1126
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:49,478
Stop! Nobody move!

1127
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:52,572
Freeze!

1128
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:54,205
Quarterback!

1129
00:57:57,819 --> 00:57:59,378
We are The Four Horsemen.

1130
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,068
Good night.

1131
00:58:13,586 --> 00:58:14,555
Get 'em off me!

1132
00:58:15,719 --> 00:58:16,978
Get off! Get off me!

1133
00:58:23,586 --> 00:58:24,325
Get off me!

1134
00:58:33,286 --> 00:58:36,413
All right. I want everyone
on the street! Everyone!

1135
00:58:38,953 --> 00:58:41,842
Fuller, meet me in front of the theater
and bring the tracker.

1136
00:58:42,486 --> 00:58:44,760
Let's go! Let's go! Now! Come on! Let's go!

1137
00:58:44,953 --> 00:58:46,222
Give me the tracker.

1138
00:58:46,519 --> 00:58:47,199
Let's go.

1139
00:58:51,553 --> 00:58:52,303
FBI! Clear!

1140
00:58:53,554 --> 00:58:54,533
- Dylan!
- Damn.

1141
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:55,797
What have you got?

1142
00:58:55,886 --> 00:58:57,455
That's him right there. Follow the red dot.

1143
00:58:57,554 --> 00:59:01,290
All right, I'll take this.
Go. Box 'em. Cut 'em off that way.

1144
00:59:02,087 --> 00:59:03,995
He's turning left on Burgundy.

1145
00:59:40,654 --> 00:59:41,343
Hey! Move!

1146
00:59:42,254 --> 00:59:43,003
Move! Move!

1147
00:59:46,121 --> 00:59:47,928
I got him heading north on Bourbon.

1148
00:59:48,021 --> 00:59:49,639
- Sorry. Move, move!
- Hey!

1149
00:59:49,821 --> 00:59:52,139
Hey, excuse me. Move, move! Excuse me.

1150
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:03,886
I've lost him at Bourbon.

1151
01:00:06,817 --> 01:00:08,193
Damn! Where are you?

1152
01:00:18,751 --> 01:00:19,922
Excuse me.

1153
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:28,029
He's heading south on Exchange Place.

1154
01:00:30,417 --> 01:00:31,451
Stop!

1155
01:00:38,484 --> 01:00:39,791
What are you doing?

1156
01:00:43,251 --> 01:00:45,353
He's going in Napoleon House.

1157
01:00:47,417 --> 01:00:48,918
Move! Move!

1158
01:00:49,851 --> 01:00:51,352
Move out of the way!

1159
01:00:52,084 --> 01:00:53,061
Hey!

1160
01:00:53,918 --> 01:00:54,895
Move!

1161
01:00:57,251 --> 01:00:59,490
He's in the bathroom.
I have him in the bathroom.

1162
01:00:59,651 --> 01:01:01,890
No! No! No!

1163
01:01:03,784 --> 01:01:04,955
Freeze!

1164
01:01:05,784 --> 01:01:07,057
Lower your weapons!

1165
01:01:07,351 --> 01:01:08,385
What?

1166
01:01:08,685 --> 01:01:10,663
I'm tracking myself!

1167
01:01:11,185 --> 01:01:14,889
The Horsemen left egg on the face of
what they call the alphabet agencies,

1168
01:01:14,984 --> 01:01:16,121
calling into question

1169
01:01:16,251 --> 01:01:18,490
the efficacy of the FBI's task force

1170
01:01:18,618 --> 01:01:21,323
as well as the man in charge
of the investigation,

1171
01:01:21,418 --> 01:01:22,862
Special Agent Dylan Rhodes,

1172
01:01:22,951 --> 01:01:24,623
who was publicly ridiculed,

1173
01:01:24,718 --> 01:01:27,559
and even tackled at tonight's performance.

1174
01:01:27,985 --> 01:01:29,223
Talk about a fumble.

1175
01:01:29,318 --> 01:01:31,125
This is quickly becoming a national story,

1176
01:01:31,418 --> 01:01:34,191
as The Horsemen have now
seemingly pulled off the impossible

1177
01:01:34,418 --> 01:01:36,692
for the second time in as many days.

1178
01:01:36,985 --> 01:01:40,161
Two nights ago in Vegas, The Horsemen
seemingly robbed a bank in Paris...

1179
01:01:40,485 --> 01:01:41,588
Hey.

1180
01:01:42,819 --> 01:01:43,922
What are you doing?

1181
01:01:44,019 --> 01:01:45,360
I'm having a drink.

1182
01:01:48,485 --> 01:01:49,827
I came to get you.

1183
01:01:50,418 --> 01:01:51,589
I'm worried about you.

1184
01:01:51,819 --> 01:01:53,297
You're worried about me.
Well, I'm worried about you.

1185
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:54,521
Atlas. You had him.

1186
01:01:54,618 --> 01:01:55,857
He didn't have a weapon.

1187
01:01:55,952 --> 01:01:57,452
I couldn't shoot him and you know that.

1188
01:01:57,585 --> 01:02:00,393
Yeah, but you... You let him go.

1189
01:02:00,585 --> 01:02:01,756
Didn't you?

1190
01:02:02,386 --> 01:02:04,022
A pretty French girl
shows up out of the blue,

1191
01:02:04,152 --> 01:02:05,823
acts like she's my partner
and then she lets the bad guy go?

1192
01:02:05,919 --> 01:02:07,022
Let go of my arm.

1193
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:08,755
Who exactly are you anyway?

1194
01:02:10,952 --> 01:02:12,930
I thought you said you were a desk agent.

1195
01:02:18,019 --> 01:02:19,224
Not bad.

1196
01:02:21,186 --> 01:02:22,163
What is this?

1197
01:02:25,186 --> 01:02:26,596
What's the Eye of Horus?

1198
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:29,798
Oh, certainly nothing
I want to get into tonight.

1199
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,420
You're dismissive enough
about me when you're sober.

1200
01:02:32,953 --> 01:02:35,123
Find your way back yourself.

1201
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:42,290
Mr. Bradley? Mr. Tressler would like you
to join him for a drink.

1202
01:02:51,719 --> 01:02:52,719
Sir.

1203
01:02:52,986 --> 01:02:54,191
Thank you.

1204
01:02:55,586 --> 01:02:57,757
What is your role with them?

1205
01:02:57,986 --> 01:02:58,963
Role?

1206
01:02:59,187 --> 01:03:00,892
Yes. You seem to know
everything about them.

1207
01:03:00,986 --> 01:03:02,725
What they're gonna do.
Where they're gonna be.

1208
01:03:02,953 --> 01:03:04,624
If it makes you feel any better,

1209
01:03:04,753 --> 01:03:05,958
this wasn't about you.

1210
01:03:06,053 --> 01:03:09,497
Please tell me why this was not about me.

1211
01:03:10,253 --> 01:03:12,821
This is a magic trick, Mr. Tressler.

1212
01:03:13,086 --> 01:03:15,394
Played out on a global scale.

1213
01:03:15,786 --> 01:03:19,730
You, sir, are the abracadabra.

1214
01:03:20,320 --> 01:03:23,059
The distraction, while they
set up the real trick.

1215
01:03:23,287 --> 01:03:27,425
I was a $140-million distraction?

1216
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:29,457
Yes.

1217
01:03:30,153 --> 01:03:34,291
And that very ego that got you involved
with them in the first place

1218
01:03:34,754 --> 01:03:36,288
is what keeps you from seeing that.

1219
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:37,955
- You know...
- "I can destroy you."

1220
01:03:38,086 --> 01:03:39,428
Yes, I do know.

1221
01:03:39,687 --> 01:03:40,926
Well, you won't.

1222
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,657
And you won't destroy them.

1223
01:03:43,787 --> 01:03:45,822
Whatever this grand trick is,

1224
01:03:46,121 --> 01:03:48,894
it was designed a long time ago.

1225
01:03:49,121 --> 01:03:53,656
And I believe that what's about to follow
is really going to amaze.

1226
01:03:54,520 --> 01:03:59,022
So I suggest
you sit back and enjoy your front row seat.

1227
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:02,158
You paid quite a lot of good money for it.

1228
01:04:02,388 --> 01:04:04,388
Whatever you stand to make

1229
01:04:06,554 --> 01:04:10,055
I'll double it, if you expose them now.

1230
01:04:10,288 --> 01:04:11,663
And destroy them.

1231
01:04:12,087 --> 01:04:14,065
I stand to make five million.

1232
01:04:14,787 --> 01:04:16,026
Am I flinching?

1233
01:04:18,188 --> 01:04:19,722
No, you're not.

1234
01:05:11,822 --> 01:05:12,822
Good morning.

1235
01:05:14,422 --> 01:05:16,695
I'm sorry. Good morning.

1236
01:05:17,155 --> 01:05:18,791
I'm sorry for your arm.

1237
01:05:19,055 --> 01:05:20,465
No.

1238
01:05:22,222 --> 01:05:24,325
I'm sorry I was a drunken asshole.

1239
01:05:24,556 --> 01:05:28,329
And I'm completely lost in this case.

1240
01:05:28,422 --> 01:05:33,162
Will you please explain to me
what all this means?

1241
01:05:35,556 --> 01:05:38,830
Okay. Sure.

1242
01:05:40,923 --> 01:05:42,662
They are called "The Eye."

1243
01:05:44,155 --> 01:05:46,030
Known for thousands of years

1244
01:05:46,255 --> 01:05:48,324
as the keepers and protectors

1245
01:05:48,422 --> 01:05:49,695
of real magic.

1246
01:05:51,056 --> 01:05:53,000
"Candidates for initiations

1247
01:05:53,089 --> 01:05:56,067
"must follow
a series of commands with blind obedience.

1248
01:05:56,923 --> 01:05:59,162
"For only by taking a leap of faith

1249
01:05:59,389 --> 01:06:01,833
"will their eyes truly be opened

1250
01:06:01,923 --> 01:06:03,662
"to the world of miracles."

1251
01:06:03,889 --> 01:06:07,129
So The Horsemen, the heists,

1252
01:06:07,355 --> 01:06:10,163
the shows, all of this is only to...

1253
01:06:10,389 --> 01:06:14,192
To join The Eye Come on.
Don't you think that's a little extreme?

1254
01:06:14,356 --> 01:06:17,027
I mean, I had to pledge
at a fraternity at Rutgers

1255
01:06:17,156 --> 01:06:21,864
and all they asked from me was to do four
beer bongs and put a diaper on a squirrel.

1256
01:06:22,089 --> 01:06:23,066
What?

1257
01:06:23,156 --> 01:06:25,532
I like squirrels. I'm not a frat guy.

1258
01:06:25,756 --> 01:06:27,200
It's just... Never mind, I'm an idiot.

1259
01:06:27,423 --> 01:06:28,729
A sweet one.

1260
01:06:31,156 --> 01:06:32,691
Have you ever

1261
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:37,998
felt something that you can't see

1262
01:06:38,989 --> 01:06:40,729
but you know it's there?

1263
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:51,423
What?

1264
01:06:51,824 --> 01:06:53,665
- Shit!
- What?

1265
01:06:54,190 --> 01:06:55,691
Look, a bug.

1266
01:06:55,924 --> 01:06:59,732
Someone has
heard every call, read every text.

1267
01:06:59,990 --> 01:07:01,194
That's how
they were able to stay ahead of us.

1268
01:07:01,323 --> 01:07:02,323
God damn it!

1269
01:07:03,390 --> 01:07:05,164
Get me Atlas' interrogation tape.

1270
01:07:05,523 --> 01:07:07,024
Yes, sir. I have it on the hard drive.

1271
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:09,959
Picture's up.

1272
01:07:10,423 --> 01:07:12,163
Okay, fast forward.

1273
01:07:12,557 --> 01:07:14,001
Go on, go on. Freeze!

1274
01:07:14,824 --> 01:07:16,563
Okay. Frame by frame. Go on.

1275
01:07:17,490 --> 01:07:18,490
Play it through.

1276
01:07:19,657 --> 01:07:21,896
Stop. Zoom in tighter. Tighter.

1277
01:07:22,391 --> 01:07:24,164
There. That's where he took my phone.

1278
01:07:25,491 --> 01:07:26,627
Is that thing transmitting?

1279
01:07:26,824 --> 01:07:28,200
Only when
you're making a call or sending a text.

1280
01:07:28,424 --> 01:07:29,401
Plus I removed the bug.

1281
01:07:29,491 --> 01:07:30,991
All right. Put it back in
and turn on the phone.

1282
01:07:31,257 --> 01:07:33,030
They don't know
that we know about the bug.

1283
01:07:33,257 --> 01:07:35,257
As of this instant, we are ahead of them.

1284
01:07:35,357 --> 01:07:37,426
We need to keep it that way. Understand?

1285
01:07:37,890 --> 01:07:39,197
Find my real phone and track it.

1286
01:07:39,291 --> 01:07:42,633
Already did. As of about 20 minutes ago,
it's in New York City.

1287
01:07:42,857 --> 01:07:43,857
Good.

1288
01:07:44,257 --> 01:07:45,962
I wanna cut 'em off at the knees.

1289
01:07:46,057 --> 01:07:47,126
They got power? Cut it.

1290
01:07:47,357 --> 01:07:50,631
They got phones, electricity, water? Cut it.

1291
01:07:50,858 --> 01:07:51,858
Squeeze 'em out.

1292
01:07:51,990 --> 01:07:53,730
I want 'em to feel our presence.

1293
01:07:53,825 --> 01:07:55,268
And get me an airplane!

1294
01:07:58,058 --> 01:07:59,865
The firewall's down.
Do they know about this?

1295
01:07:59,958 --> 01:08:00,935
They who?

1296
01:08:01,025 --> 01:08:02,798
"They," "them," whoever we're working for.

1297
01:08:03,025 --> 01:08:04,161
Who are we working for?

1298
01:08:04,324 --> 01:08:06,359
And are we prepared to go to jail for them?

1299
01:08:06,491 --> 01:08:07,468
Stop being paranoid.

1300
01:08:07,691 --> 01:08:08,725
It really does happen.

1301
01:08:08,991 --> 01:08:10,525
It happened to you.
Doesn't mean it's gonna happen to us.

1302
01:08:10,691 --> 01:08:12,226
Guys, I don't know if can do this, all right.

1303
01:08:12,357 --> 01:08:13,630
I don't want to go to jail, you know?

1304
01:08:13,724 --> 01:08:16,762
Then don't screw up. You're always talking
about wanting to be treated like an adult.

1305
01:08:16,891 --> 01:08:18,062
Now might be a good time
to start acting like one.

1306
01:08:18,158 --> 01:08:20,295
Stick to the plan. Stay here and burn it all.

1307
01:08:33,392 --> 01:08:34,563
I don't know what I'm doing here.

1308
01:08:34,791 --> 01:08:35,768
I don't know
what you would do anywhere else.

1309
01:08:35,858 --> 01:08:38,268
I'm here for the pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow.

1310
01:08:38,659 --> 01:08:40,728
That's it. Then I'm gone.

1311
01:08:40,858 --> 01:08:42,995
You can do whatever you want
when this is over, Merritt.

1312
01:08:43,225 --> 01:08:45,328
But until then, you stick to the plan.

1313
01:08:45,425 --> 01:08:47,460
Hey, guys. They're here.

1314
01:08:49,325 --> 01:08:51,303
- My guys are ready to go.
- Let's do this quickly...

1315
01:08:51,392 --> 01:08:52,665
- No.
- What?

1316
01:08:52,759 --> 01:08:53,963
She doesn't have jurisdiction here.

1317
01:08:54,225 --> 01:08:55,464
She's Interpol. She's with me.

1318
01:08:55,559 --> 01:08:56,559
She stays.

1319
01:08:56,659 --> 01:08:57,932
What? What?

1320
01:08:58,025 --> 01:08:59,003
Stay in the car.

1321
01:09:01,258 --> 01:09:02,463
Let's go.

1322
01:09:08,092 --> 01:09:09,126
Okay. Let's do it.

1323
01:09:13,592 --> 01:09:14,569
FBI!

1324
01:09:18,859 --> 01:09:20,166
Ladies first.

1325
01:09:20,759 --> 01:09:21,964
Don't move!

1326
01:09:28,026 --> 01:09:29,470
Tell me.

1327
01:09:29,559 --> 01:09:31,265
Is my money being well-spent?

1328
01:09:31,826 --> 01:09:33,701
Exceedingly well.

1329
01:09:35,493 --> 01:09:36,970
Now you tell me,

1330
01:09:37,759 --> 01:09:39,396
how do you like your Horsemen?

1331
01:09:39,593 --> 01:09:41,593
Fricasseed or fried?

1332
01:09:41,892 --> 01:09:42,892
Shredded.

1333
01:09:44,026 --> 01:09:45,470
I'll tell the chef.

1334
01:11:00,993 --> 01:11:01,970
Freeze!

1335
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:10,137
Dylan!

1336
01:11:11,093 --> 01:11:12,230
Hold on!

1337
01:11:14,594 --> 01:11:15,628
You little...

1338
01:11:20,161 --> 01:11:21,138
Come here!

1339
01:11:22,894 --> 01:11:24,803
Five is clear. Standing by for six.

1340
01:11:25,028 --> 01:11:27,261
You little shit!

1341
01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:29,531
- What game are you playing?
- What game are you playing?

1342
01:11:29,894 --> 01:11:31,929
We're all good at six. Move to seven.

1343
01:11:32,028 --> 01:11:34,028
Copy that. Going to seven. Go, go, go!

1344
01:11:35,894 --> 01:11:36,997
Hey!

1345
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:39,966
Come here!

1346
01:12:10,995 --> 01:12:12,131
Come here!

1347
01:12:12,228 --> 01:12:13,900
All right, hold on, hold on!

1348
01:12:15,829 --> 01:12:17,636
- Really?
- Yup.

1349
01:12:21,628 --> 01:12:22,605
You...

1350
01:12:26,095 --> 01:12:27,538
You little...

1351
01:12:39,728 --> 01:12:40,762
Shit!

1352
01:12:59,162 --> 01:13:00,162
Shit!

1353
01:13:01,596 --> 01:13:02,937
Give me that!

1354
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:22,638
All units, cover the north exit now!

1355
01:13:22,729 --> 01:13:24,105
Clear on Evan.

1356
01:13:24,196 --> 01:13:25,936
Block every possible exit.

1357
01:13:26,030 --> 01:13:27,234
Hey! Get back. Shit.

1358
01:13:29,096 --> 01:13:31,199
- FBI. Sort of. I need your car. Thanks.
- What?

1359
01:13:31,296 --> 01:13:32,273
What?

1360
01:13:34,263 --> 01:13:35,865
Stop! Stop!

1361
01:13:52,030 --> 01:13:53,030
Hey!

1362
01:14:22,931 --> 01:14:23,908
Good. Follow him!

1363
01:14:24,031 --> 01:14:26,907
Don't ever tell me to stay in the car. Ever.

1364
01:14:26,997 --> 01:14:28,201
Fine! Now go!

1365
01:14:53,031 --> 01:14:54,031
There he is!

1366
01:15:05,198 --> 01:15:06,175
Move!

1367
01:15:10,698 --> 01:15:11,698
Left!

1368
01:15:14,231 --> 01:15:15,868
We're heading east on the FDR Drive.

1369
01:15:15,964 --> 01:15:17,874
- This is not east.
- North! North!

1370
01:15:18,164 --> 01:15:20,164
We're coming to you live above the FDR,

1371
01:15:20,264 --> 01:15:23,174
where NYPD
and federal agents, as you now see,

1372
01:15:23,264 --> 01:15:25,139
are engaged in a high-speed pursuit,

1373
01:15:25,264 --> 01:15:26,469
following a black sedan.

1374
01:15:31,431 --> 01:15:32,408
Fuller, where are you?

1375
01:15:32,932 --> 01:15:34,568
Right here. Trying to catch up to you now.

1376
01:15:34,798 --> 01:15:36,798
We're now trying to get you a better shot.

1377
01:15:39,331 --> 01:15:40,400
Come on!

1378
01:15:46,098 --> 01:15:49,401
It looks like they're turning
onto the 59th Street Bridge.

1379
01:15:51,465 --> 01:15:54,938
As soon as we have them within range,
we will bring you those pictures live.

1380
01:16:00,499 --> 01:16:01,669
Good. Just stay with him.

1381
01:16:09,065 --> 01:16:10,270
Go, go, go!

1382
01:16:14,332 --> 01:16:15,832
Behind... You're behind the bus!

1383
01:16:19,432 --> 01:16:20,466
Get over!

1384
01:16:24,065 --> 01:16:25,065
Oh, shit!

1385
01:16:45,632 --> 01:16:46,609
Come here!

1386
01:16:47,899 --> 01:16:49,309
Get back! Get back!

1387
01:16:50,799 --> 01:16:52,072
Dylan, let's go, man!

1388
01:16:52,300 --> 01:16:53,300
Come on, you...

1389
01:16:54,799 --> 01:16:56,834
- Come on, man! Get out!
- He's gonna die in here.

1390
01:16:56,933 --> 01:16:58,275
Leave him! There's nothing you can do!

1391
01:16:58,400 --> 01:17:00,275
Let's go! Leave him!

1392
01:17:05,099 --> 01:17:06,475
'1-he Paper!
- Dylan!

1393
01:17:06,732 --> 01:17:08,641
Let's go! Let's go! Come on!

1394
01:17:43,333 --> 01:17:46,005
Dylan, they just
figured out what the paper was in Jack's car.

1395
01:17:46,100 --> 01:17:47,372
So they know what it is?

1396
01:17:47,467 --> 01:17:49,173
And why the kid died trying to protect it.

1397
01:17:49,267 --> 01:17:50,903
Evans is on his way to brief us right now.

1398
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,534
Let's go.

1399
01:17:52,633 --> 01:17:53,940
You're gonna wanna take this first, though.

1400
01:17:54,034 --> 01:17:55,011
What's that?

1401
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:57,374
Your friend Thaddeus Bradley.

1402
01:17:57,900 --> 01:17:58,877
Rhodes.

1403
01:17:59,234 --> 01:18:00,802
You do understand the function

1404
01:18:00,934 --> 01:18:03,037
of the magician's assistant,
don't you, Agent Rhodes?

1405
01:18:03,267 --> 01:18:06,105
Yeah, she's there to distract them
while he sets up the trick.

1406
01:18:07,301 --> 01:18:09,472
You'd be right if you weren't so wrong.

1407
01:18:09,900 --> 01:18:11,606
While you're watching the magician,

1408
01:18:12,468 --> 01:18:14,706
that lovely innocent
is actually pulling the strings.

1409
01:18:14,934 --> 01:18:18,037
Don't you find it peculiar
that Interpol would send you

1410
01:18:18,134 --> 01:18:21,578
a first timer off the desk
to be your assistant?

1411
01:18:22,067 --> 01:18:24,204
Why did she request to be put on the case?

1412
01:18:24,634 --> 01:18:26,543
She was assigned to the case.

1413
01:18:27,434 --> 01:18:28,776
Luck of the draw.

1414
01:18:29,401 --> 01:18:32,436
Like choosing a random card in the deck.

1415
01:18:32,668 --> 01:18:36,202
I find it odd, your sudden act of generosity.

1416
01:18:36,301 --> 01:18:37,404
What's in it for you?

1417
01:18:37,601 --> 01:18:39,408
Just trying to even the game.

1418
01:18:39,668 --> 01:18:43,635
I feel like I'm playing with somebody
wearing ankle weights and flippers.

1419
01:18:44,801 --> 01:18:48,540
Keep up, Agent Rhodes. Keep up.

1420
01:18:52,401 --> 01:18:53,435
Hey.

1421
01:18:53,768 --> 01:18:54,973
We got a problem.

1422
01:18:56,168 --> 01:18:57,237
Here's the safe.

1423
01:18:57,334 --> 01:18:58,744
No, no, no. Hey.

1424
01:18:58,868 --> 01:19:00,107
What's he doing here?

1425
01:19:00,302 --> 01:19:01,870
Giving us our first solid lead.

1426
01:19:01,968 --> 01:19:05,106
We've been investigating a private
security contractor called Elkhorn

1427
01:19:05,202 --> 01:19:07,146
- for the last five years.
- And?

1428
01:19:07,235 --> 01:19:08,871
They've been hiding close
to a half billion dollars...

1429
01:19:08,968 --> 01:19:11,412
I didn't ask you. I asked him.

1430
01:19:11,835 --> 01:19:14,109
The money's in a vault inside
a warehouse in Queens.

1431
01:19:14,335 --> 01:19:16,778
We think this vault
is your magicians' final target.

1432
01:19:17,001 --> 01:19:18,910
The magician who died on the bridge...

1433
01:19:19,001 --> 01:19:22,411
You pulled our classified Elkhorn file
right from his crispy little hand.

1434
01:19:22,835 --> 01:19:24,813
And despite their bullshit
Robin Hood razzle-dazzle,

1435
01:19:25,101 --> 01:19:26,942
your magicians are nothing
more than common thieves.

1436
01:19:27,068 --> 01:19:28,239
How did they get the file?

1437
01:19:29,569 --> 01:19:32,579
This is the part you're gonna find
particularly interesting, Agent Rhodes.

1438
01:19:32,802 --> 01:19:35,109
They patched to my server
after they accessed

1439
01:19:35,202 --> 01:19:39,137
your mobile command center in New Orleans
with codes they got from your phone.

1440
01:19:41,302 --> 01:19:43,109
You ordered us all out to chase after them.

1441
01:19:43,569 --> 01:19:46,137
The level of incompetence
displayed on this case,

1442
01:19:46,235 --> 01:19:48,713
that's a magic trick in and of itself.

1443
01:19:48,802 --> 01:19:51,041
Abracadabra. I'm taking over.

1444
01:19:52,502 --> 01:19:54,377
Boss, he's taking over?

1445
01:19:54,936 --> 01:19:56,914
Let's go, gentlemen.

1446
01:19:58,335 --> 01:19:59,677
Hey.

1447
01:19:59,836 --> 01:20:01,280
Hey. I want to have a word with you.

1448
01:20:01,402 --> 01:20:02,539
Don't ever talk to me like that again.

1449
01:20:02,635 --> 01:20:04,670
- Why the hell did you take this case?
- What?

1450
01:20:04,769 --> 01:20:06,906
People say I'm "hard to read."
That's an American expression.

1451
01:20:07,036 --> 01:20:08,445
Do you understand it?

1452
01:20:08,535 --> 01:20:09,535
Yes.

1453
01:20:09,669 --> 01:20:11,908
Good, then let me make myself
perfectly clear to you.

1454
01:20:12,002 --> 01:20:15,640
If I find out that you are anything other
than who you say you are, I swear...

1455
01:20:15,735 --> 01:20:17,475
And we French also have an expression.

1456
01:20:19,503 --> 01:20:21,037
"Faith can move mountains."

1457
01:20:21,269 --> 01:20:24,874
If we hope to capture The Horsemen,
then you need to have a little faith in me.

1458
01:20:25,102 --> 01:20:27,080
Because I've done nothing
to deserve otherwise.

1459
01:20:27,303 --> 01:20:29,906
I just got my ass handed to me.

1460
01:20:30,002 --> 01:20:31,537
I am losing this case.

1461
01:20:31,636 --> 01:20:34,943
So faith is a luxury
I don't have any time for right now.

1462
01:20:47,003 --> 01:20:48,173
Approaching the warehouse.

1463
01:20:48,269 --> 01:20:50,975
Units 5 and 6
cover the north and south entrances.

1464
01:20:51,070 --> 01:20:52,308
We are going for the vault.

1465
01:20:57,170 --> 01:21:00,046
Hey. Where's the safe? Where's the safe?

1466
01:21:04,270 --> 01:21:05,247
What is this?

1467
01:21:05,336 --> 01:21:06,609
Where the hell is the goddamn safe?

1468
01:21:06,803 --> 01:21:08,542
We just moved it while you were outside.

1469
01:21:08,736 --> 01:21:09,907
- Evans' orders.
- What?

1470
01:21:10,003 --> 01:21:11,037
I never said that.

1471
01:21:11,137 --> 01:21:14,173
Sir, you got a phone call
and said Washington wants the safe moved.

1472
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:16,305
You never heard that
come out of my mouth, agent.

1473
01:21:16,437 --> 01:21:17,414
What happened?

1474
01:21:17,504 --> 01:21:19,708
You tell me what's going on,
because this is bullshit!

1475
01:21:19,803 --> 01:21:20,872
No!

1476
01:21:26,770 --> 01:21:28,248
Jesus Christ.

1477
01:21:28,471 --> 01:21:31,449
Sir? Sir? What are you doing?

1478
01:21:31,537 --> 01:21:33,378
I think it's Beethoven's Concerto in D-Major.

1479
01:21:33,471 --> 01:21:34,471
Where's the safe?

1480
01:21:34,571 --> 01:21:35,640
His team is loading the truck.

1481
01:21:39,937 --> 01:21:41,574
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

1482
01:21:43,170 --> 01:21:44,307
- Stop the truck!
- Stop!

1483
01:21:45,337 --> 01:21:47,440
- Stop!
- Hey! Stop that truck!

1484
01:21:56,104 --> 01:21:57,979
What the hell's going on?
We got our orders.

1485
01:21:58,071 --> 01:21:59,810
Now you've got new orders. Open it up.

1486
01:22:03,771 --> 01:22:05,544
Okay. Here's what I want.

1487
01:22:05,637 --> 01:22:07,876
At this moment,
they think that safe's leaving this site.

1488
01:22:08,171 --> 01:22:09,274
So we stay with it.

1489
01:22:09,370 --> 01:22:11,246
We follow it
all the way to... Where's it going?

1490
01:22:11,537 --> 01:22:12,571
5 Pointz. Up the street.

1491
01:22:13,071 --> 01:22:15,912
So we go to 5 Pointz.
Wherever the safe goes, we go.

1492
01:22:16,138 --> 01:22:17,207
It'll lead us right to 'em.

1493
01:22:18,138 --> 01:22:19,309
You two are with me.

1494
01:22:31,938 --> 01:22:33,177
Guys.

1495
01:22:34,171 --> 01:22:36,649
Look. Office just called with this.

1496
01:22:36,738 --> 01:22:38,579
Horsemen posted it to YouTube
20 minutes ago.

1497
01:22:39,004 --> 01:22:42,539
The point of why we're here
is to say that we are not...

1498
01:22:42,839 --> 01:22:44,612
We cannot quit now.

1499
01:22:44,839 --> 01:22:47,282
We've started something
bigger than all of us.

1500
01:22:47,505 --> 01:22:49,039
We have to finish it.

1501
01:22:49,138 --> 01:22:51,673
Remember the name Jack Wilder
when you see us live,

1502
01:22:51,772 --> 01:22:53,647
5 Pointz, Queens, 7:00.

1503
01:22:53,905 --> 01:22:54,939
Their show is in a half an hour.

1504
01:22:55,071 --> 01:22:56,276
It's exactly where we're headed.

1505
01:22:56,505 --> 01:23:00,783
I don't know, boss. I don't wanna be the
naysayer, but these guys are kinda tricky.

1506
01:23:00,872 --> 01:23:03,440
Rhodes, they're entertainers.

1507
01:23:06,005 --> 01:23:08,142
A stunning turnout here in 5 Pointz

1508
01:23:08,239 --> 01:23:12,047
as the renegade Horsemen
taunt the FBI into a final showdown.

1509
01:23:12,139 --> 01:23:13,548
The Horsemen have invited
us to their final round

1510
01:23:13,638 --> 01:23:15,775
of their three-act face-off with the FBI.

1511
01:23:16,306 --> 01:23:19,647
What do they have in store?
We're about to find out.

1512
01:23:31,005 --> 01:23:33,244
All eyes on the truck.
Let's see who approaches.

1513
01:23:33,339 --> 01:23:34,646
Copy that.

1514
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:52,613
Agents Rhodes, Fuller?

1515
01:23:53,339 --> 01:23:54,316
Go, for us.

1516
01:23:54,473 --> 01:23:57,076
We've got movement.
Someone's walking toward the truck.

1517
01:23:57,239 --> 01:23:58,683
It's a woman.

1518
01:24:02,439 --> 01:24:03,576
- Freeze!
- Oh, shit!

1519
01:24:05,406 --> 01:24:06,884
What the hell's going on?

1520
01:24:07,973 --> 01:24:10,314
Hey! It's the guy from the TV.

1521
01:24:10,406 --> 01:24:11,406
Put your guns down.

1522
01:24:11,673 --> 01:24:14,480
Look who it is. The fifth Horseman.

1523
01:24:14,673 --> 01:24:15,650
Are you kidding?

1524
01:24:15,739 --> 01:24:17,546
I'm following them, just like you are.

1525
01:24:17,639 --> 01:24:19,242
I'm not following anybody anymore.

1526
01:24:19,340 --> 01:24:21,045
You've been ahead of us this whole time.

1527
01:24:21,140 --> 01:24:22,742
But guess what? I'm ahead of you now.

1528
01:24:22,973 --> 01:24:24,575
Your ass is mine.

1529
01:24:24,806 --> 01:24:26,545
You guys are still idiots.

1530
01:24:26,773 --> 01:24:27,807
Yeah?

1531
01:24:27,906 --> 01:24:31,141
This happens to be the former
rehearsal space for Lionel Shrike.

1532
01:24:31,606 --> 01:24:33,414
It's where I did my first show.

1533
01:24:33,639 --> 01:24:36,413
Now, if you wanna look
like even bigger idiots,

1534
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:37,878
why not open it?

1535
01:24:38,273 --> 01:24:41,809
And while you're doing it, Agent Rhodes,
would you mind reenacting your look

1536
01:24:42,040 --> 01:24:43,915
of absolute befuddlement for me?

1537
01:24:44,106 --> 01:24:46,175
It will make a wonderful cover for my DVD.

1538
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:48,779
Open the safe.

1539
01:24:48,873 --> 01:24:50,351
- Go ahead.
- Open it.

1540
01:24:54,707 --> 01:24:55,707
What the hell?

1541
01:24:58,173 --> 01:24:59,207
What?

1542
01:24:59,507 --> 01:25:00,541
Give me that.

1543
01:25:00,774 --> 01:25:01,774
No.

1544
01:25:01,974 --> 01:25:02,951
No!

1545
01:25:07,607 --> 01:25:08,641
What is this?

1546
01:25:09,774 --> 01:25:10,751
Get back!

1547
01:25:18,373 --> 01:25:20,476
Who doesn't love a good magic trick?

1548
01:25:21,141 --> 01:25:23,448
They have you chasing empty safes again.

1549
01:25:24,807 --> 01:25:27,978
Once again, misdirection.

1550
01:25:34,941 --> 01:25:36,577
The show is starting. Move out!

1551
01:25:36,674 --> 01:25:39,118
The question
I'd be asking now, Agent Rhodes is,

1552
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:41,743
"What happened to the real one?"

1553
01:26:02,408 --> 01:26:04,147
Clear! Clear 'em out!

1554
01:26:04,241 --> 01:26:05,776
Come on. Move 'em out.
Move 'em out of the way.

1555
01:26:07,241 --> 01:26:09,082
FBI! Give me a path!

1556
01:26:09,741 --> 01:26:11,309
Clear out! Clear out!

1557
01:26:11,575 --> 01:26:12,917
What is magic?

1558
01:26:13,775 --> 01:26:14,809
Magic is deception.

1559
01:26:14,942 --> 01:26:16,647
But deception designed to delight,

1560
01:26:16,908 --> 01:26:18,544
to entertain, to inspire.

1561
01:26:18,775 --> 01:26:21,083
Look out! Clear! Clear! Look out!

1562
01:26:21,475 --> 01:26:22,578
It is about belief.

1563
01:26:22,675 --> 01:26:23,652
Faith.

1564
01:26:23,775 --> 01:26:24,752
Trust.

1565
01:26:28,775 --> 01:26:30,117
Without those qualities,

1566
01:26:30,242 --> 01:26:33,651
magic, as an art form,
would no longer exist.

1567
01:26:34,242 --> 01:26:36,049
But what happens if these qualities

1568
01:26:36,275 --> 01:26:38,219
are not used for their higher purpose?

1569
01:26:38,442 --> 01:26:41,215
And instead they're used to cheat, lie.

1570
01:26:41,442 --> 01:26:43,612
For personal gain or for greed.

1571
01:26:43,842 --> 01:26:45,445
Then it's no longer magic.

1572
01:26:45,675 --> 01:26:46,709
It's crime.

1573
01:26:46,942 --> 01:26:49,943
So tonight, for our final act,

1574
01:26:50,042 --> 01:26:52,849
you're gonna help us set a few things right.

1575
01:26:57,008 --> 01:26:58,145
What's going on here, Rhodes?

1576
01:26:58,409 --> 01:26:59,284
I don't know.

1577
01:27:00,642 --> 01:27:01,813
Showtime.

1578
01:27:06,975 --> 01:27:07,976
Look!

1579
01:27:12,309 --> 01:27:14,218
There they are on the roof. Let's move!

1580
01:27:14,309 --> 01:27:15,582
Go, go, go!

1581
01:27:16,342 --> 01:27:17,615
- Dylan!
- FBI, coming through!

1582
01:27:19,242 --> 01:27:20,242
What are you doing here?

1583
01:27:20,409 --> 01:27:22,643
They're going in the wrong direction
and you know it.

1584
01:27:22,943 --> 01:27:25,250
Rhodes! I need all personnel now!

1585
01:27:25,409 --> 01:27:28,717
You need to trust me.
Take your leap of faith.

1586
01:27:29,576 --> 01:27:30,610
Wait.

1587
01:27:31,109 --> 01:27:32,212
I'm going to go with her.

1588
01:27:32,442 --> 01:27:33,647
Go. I got your back. I'll be right here.

1589
01:27:50,742 --> 01:27:54,743
Let's go, let's go! Now, now, now!

1590
01:28:05,909 --> 01:28:06,943
Daniel?

1591
01:28:07,643 --> 01:28:08,814
Yeah?

1592
01:28:08,943 --> 01:28:13,547
As our, let's call it,
year of living dangerously

1593
01:28:13,777 --> 01:28:17,084
comes to a close,
in a rare moment of vulnerability,

1594
01:28:17,310 --> 01:28:19,948
I'd like to express a sentiment

1595
01:28:20,077 --> 01:28:21,645
to you about our relationship.

1596
01:28:21,910 --> 01:28:22,910
Okay.

1597
01:28:23,310 --> 01:28:29,620
Well, when I first met you,
I thought you were kind of a dick.

1598
01:28:31,177 --> 01:28:32,177
And?

1599
01:28:34,010 --> 01:28:35,646
No, that's it.

1600
01:28:35,910 --> 01:28:36,887
That's very nice.

1601
01:28:36,977 --> 01:28:38,454
- Yeah.
- I'm touched.

1602
01:28:38,677 --> 01:28:40,087
Yeah. Just from the heart.

1603
01:28:40,311 --> 01:28:41,879
Well, I didn't tell you where I was touched.

1604
01:28:42,044 --> 01:28:43,044
Oh, you!

1605
01:28:46,643 --> 01:28:48,315
Oh, God.
What are we gonna do when this is over?

1606
01:28:48,577 --> 01:28:49,611
We're on our own.

1607
01:28:49,743 --> 01:28:51,380
Our instructions run out after the show.

1608
01:28:52,311 --> 01:28:55,982
Even if there is no "Eye,"
if we were completely played and we spend

1609
01:28:56,110 --> 01:28:58,088
the next 20 years in jail, then,

1610
01:28:58,644 --> 01:29:00,315
I just want to say that...

1611
01:29:00,578 --> 01:29:02,919
I know. Me, too.

1612
01:29:04,277 --> 01:29:06,186
Little too sentimental for me.

1613
01:29:13,177 --> 01:29:14,211
There they are!

1614
01:29:17,244 --> 01:29:19,950
Go grab 'em! Put 'em down! Go, go, go!

1615
01:29:20,110 --> 01:29:21,087
Grab 'em!

1616
01:29:26,111 --> 01:29:27,145
Get up!

1617
01:29:27,611 --> 01:29:28,748
What the hell?

1618
01:29:32,578 --> 01:29:33,715
Shit!

1619
01:29:42,945 --> 01:29:44,184
Hello, New York!

1620
01:29:52,678 --> 01:29:54,587
Thank you for the magic.

1621
01:29:54,811 --> 01:29:58,989
And thank you for being such
an incredible and dedicated audience.

1622
01:29:59,412 --> 01:30:01,412
Unfortunately, like all good things,

1623
01:30:01,512 --> 01:30:03,251
it must come to an end.

1624
01:30:06,011 --> 01:30:08,489
So we would like to start our show tonight...

1625
01:30:08,579 --> 01:30:10,079
BY Saying goodbye.

1626
01:30:11,479 --> 01:30:12,786
All we wanted was to

1627
01:30:12,911 --> 01:30:14,856
bring the world to a magic show.

1628
01:30:14,945 --> 01:30:17,649
And thereby bring a little magic
back to the world.

1629
01:30:21,679 --> 01:30:22,782
Clear the way!

1630
01:30:32,579 --> 01:30:35,750
This has been
one hell of a ride for all of us.

1631
01:30:36,312 --> 01:30:38,620
But it's time for us to disappear.

1632
01:30:38,846 --> 01:30:40,153
Good night, New York.

1633
01:30:40,412 --> 01:30:41,788
And thank you for believing in us.

1634
01:30:44,479 --> 01:30:45,582
Stop!

1635
01:30:49,112 --> 01:30:50,089
Freeze!

1636
01:30:50,545 --> 01:30:51,682
No!

1637
01:31:09,779 --> 01:31:11,052
God damn it!

1638
01:31:40,813 --> 01:31:41,984
I'm sorry.

1639
01:31:43,180 --> 01:31:45,249
You were right. It's bigger than all of us.

1640
01:31:46,413 --> 01:31:50,482
This is one time I'm not happy being right.

1641
01:31:52,580 --> 01:31:54,286
So I guess this is it.

1642
01:31:56,314 --> 01:31:57,451
Is it?

1643
01:32:23,681 --> 01:32:24,953
Dylan!

1644
01:32:25,347 --> 01:32:27,552
Dylan! Dylan!

1645
01:32:27,914 --> 01:32:28,914
Hey.

1646
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:32,189
- You see that?
- What?

1647
01:32:35,848 --> 01:32:37,189
Where's the real money?

1648
01:32:51,380 --> 01:32:55,291
You're under arrest! Hands in the air! Now!

1649
01:33:46,448 --> 01:33:47,551
I've been framed.

1650
01:33:48,915 --> 01:33:49,915
I'm sure you were.

1651
01:33:50,049 --> 01:33:51,287
Yeah, but I can prove it.

1652
01:33:51,815 --> 01:33:53,054
I always do.

1653
01:33:53,448 --> 01:33:55,426
Just like I predicted that you'd play the fool.

1654
01:33:55,515 --> 01:33:57,993
Let's just drop the theatricality, all right?

1655
01:33:58,249 --> 01:34:00,386
The cameras aren't rolling in here.

1656
01:34:00,615 --> 01:34:03,116
Fellas, can I have a few minutes
with my friend here alone, please.

1657
01:34:03,216 --> 01:34:05,023
Sure.

1658
01:34:10,015 --> 01:34:11,015
All right.

1659
01:34:12,082 --> 01:34:13,684
I got information to trade.

1660
01:34:13,815 --> 01:34:14,986
I believe that's how it's done. Huh?

1661
01:34:15,216 --> 01:34:16,818
If it's of some value.

1662
01:34:19,282 --> 01:34:22,419
These bars give a man time to think.

1663
01:34:23,649 --> 01:34:26,888
And I'm pretty sure I know how they did it.

1664
01:34:27,382 --> 01:34:29,451
Remember the rabbit trick
in the second show?

1665
01:34:30,649 --> 01:34:32,456
The box was never empty.

1666
01:34:34,850 --> 01:34:35,986
The room wasn't either.

1667
01:34:37,282 --> 01:34:39,658
After gaining access to the warehouse,

1668
01:34:40,016 --> 01:34:42,084
The Horsemen left the real safe

1669
01:34:42,182 --> 01:34:44,558
and transformed the whole room

1670
01:34:44,649 --> 01:34:47,127
into a giant rabbit box.

1671
01:34:48,749 --> 01:34:50,886
You go charging in there,

1672
01:34:51,150 --> 01:34:53,559
thinking the safe was already gone.

1673
01:34:53,816 --> 01:34:54,793
Hey!

1674
01:34:54,883 --> 01:34:56,156
Hey! Stop!

1675
01:34:56,382 --> 01:34:57,792
Missing the trick. Again.

1676
01:34:57,883 --> 01:35:00,684
Which was to make you think
the safe had already been stolen,

1677
01:35:00,783 --> 01:35:02,988
so you'd drop your guard and leave.

1678
01:35:03,583 --> 01:35:06,527
Now, while you were busy
playing with balloon animals,

1679
01:35:06,749 --> 01:35:09,318
someone was breaking into the warehouse.

1680
01:35:27,850 --> 01:35:28,987
Who?

1681
01:35:30,417 --> 01:35:31,894
Jack Wilder.

1682
01:35:32,684 --> 01:35:33,990
Holy shit.

1683
01:35:34,217 --> 01:35:36,559
No. No way. He died
right in front of my eyes.

1684
01:35:37,383 --> 01:35:39,292
Unless, of course, he didn't.

1685
01:35:46,817 --> 01:35:48,056
It's locked.

1686
01:35:48,884 --> 01:35:50,055
Weren't you listening?

1687
01:35:50,584 --> 01:35:51,618
Nothing's ever locked.

1688
01:35:53,051 --> 01:35:55,790
Well done, Mr. Wilder! Good work.

1689
01:35:56,017 --> 01:35:57,790
You're a big boy now, Jack.

1690
01:35:58,017 --> 01:36:00,358
He escaped in a standard FBI vehicle, right?

1691
01:36:04,184 --> 01:36:05,490
Led you to the bridge.

1692
01:36:05,750 --> 01:36:09,360
Where the other Horsemen were waiting
with an identical replacement car.

1693
01:36:10,384 --> 01:36:13,527
It only took a split second for you to
lose contact with it and make the switch.

1694
01:36:35,851 --> 01:36:38,830
When you crawled into that burning car,

1695
01:36:39,218 --> 01:36:41,196
quite heroically, I might add,

1696
01:36:43,084 --> 01:36:45,153
you almost died trying to rescue

1697
01:36:45,251 --> 01:36:48,229
what I assume was
a cadaver from the morgue.

1698
01:36:49,751 --> 01:36:53,388
Why go through
such an elaborate and dangerous plan

1699
01:36:54,184 --> 01:36:55,662
just to frame one guy?

1700
01:36:56,018 --> 01:36:57,018
I don't know.

1701
01:36:57,152 --> 01:36:58,561
They never kept any of the money they took.

1702
01:36:58,685 --> 01:37:01,061
Yeah, that's the part
I haven't been able to put together yet.

1703
01:37:01,152 --> 01:37:03,857
But I just gave you information that
is substantially more important.

1704
01:37:04,018 --> 01:37:05,689
- No. Not really.
- What?

1705
01:37:05,785 --> 01:37:10,321
I finally got a chance to
really look into Lionel Shrike.

1706
01:37:10,618 --> 01:37:13,358
His comeback attempt. His accident.

1707
01:37:14,319 --> 01:37:17,785
The insurer who denied the family's claim?

1708
01:37:18,052 --> 01:37:19,223
Tressler Insurance.

1709
01:37:21,185 --> 01:37:23,390
The bank that carried the note?

1710
01:37:24,486 --> 01:37:26,157
Credit Republican of Paris.

1711
01:37:26,385 --> 01:37:27,953
Credit Republicain de Paris.

1712
01:37:29,352 --> 01:37:30,761
What do you make of that?

1713
01:37:30,852 --> 01:37:32,955
A sucker is born every minute.

1714
01:37:33,751 --> 01:37:36,320
What if all this was just leading up to

1715
01:37:36,419 --> 01:37:39,124
us getting mugged
in Central Park at 2:00 a.m.?

1716
01:37:39,219 --> 01:37:41,924
No, I'm telling you,
we're right where we need to be.

1717
01:37:42,018 --> 01:37:43,087
We just have to find...

1718
01:37:43,185 --> 01:37:44,254
That?

1719
01:37:46,819 --> 01:37:48,524
The Lionel Shrike tree.

1720
01:37:49,486 --> 01:37:51,964
And the card encased in glass.

1721
01:37:53,352 --> 01:37:54,921
What do we do now?

1722
01:38:11,586 --> 01:38:13,030
Oh, nice!

1723
01:38:28,886 --> 01:38:30,330
So, here's my new theory.

1724
01:38:30,819 --> 01:38:34,229
The legend is that the "Eye" is everywhere.

1725
01:38:34,919 --> 01:38:36,056
Waiting

1726
01:38:36,487 --> 01:38:40,226
for the truly great magicians
to distinguish themselves

1727
01:38:41,220 --> 01:38:42,959
from the mediocre ones.

1728
01:38:43,819 --> 01:38:45,024
Maybe that was you.

1729
01:38:45,687 --> 01:38:47,891
Deep down inside
you wanted nothing more

1730
01:38:48,019 --> 01:38:50,623
than to be part of the "Eye,"
but you were never invited.

1731
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:53,857
So you try to destroy them.
But instead what happens?

1732
01:38:54,353 --> 01:38:55,797
You pissed them off.

1733
01:38:57,553 --> 01:39:00,554
The Eye isn't real.

1734
01:39:00,653 --> 01:39:03,722
Okay, then, explain then.
Who's behind all this?

1735
01:39:04,020 --> 01:39:05,326
Somebody with an obsession.

1736
01:39:05,587 --> 01:39:06,997
- Meticulous.
- Who?

1737
01:39:07,087 --> 01:39:10,394
Somebody prepared to sacrifice everything.

1738
01:39:10,487 --> 01:39:13,056
Somebody so prepared to lose

1739
01:39:13,154 --> 01:39:15,654
that they wouldn't even be a suspect
until the trick was done.

1740
01:39:15,753 --> 01:39:18,560
I don't want a profile.
I need a name. Who? Who?

1741
01:39:18,653 --> 01:39:20,325
I don't know who.

1742
01:39:20,720 --> 01:39:22,891
But they had to have
access to the warehouse

1743
01:39:23,020 --> 01:39:24,327
to plant the mirrors.

1744
01:39:25,653 --> 01:39:29,496
Always a step ahead of me. And the FBI.

1745
01:39:29,587 --> 01:39:32,827
Got past them not once,
not twice, but consistently.

1746
01:39:33,187 --> 01:39:35,755
Almost as if they were on the...

1747
01:39:48,688 --> 01:39:50,029
The inside.

1748
01:40:02,154 --> 01:40:03,188
You.

1749
01:40:07,821 --> 01:40:08,821
Why?

1750
01:40:09,654 --> 01:40:11,996
That is the question, isn't it?

1751
01:40:12,821 --> 01:40:14,355
You're right.

1752
01:40:14,988 --> 01:40:17,329
I can't tell you how long I've waited

1753
01:40:17,421 --> 01:40:19,365
to see the look on your face.

1754
01:40:21,855 --> 01:40:23,299
Who are you?

1755
01:40:24,421 --> 01:40:25,797
What do you want from me?

1756
01:40:26,688 --> 01:40:28,166
What do I want?

1757
01:40:28,588 --> 01:40:31,498
I want you to spend
the rest of your life in this cell,

1758
01:40:31,588 --> 01:40:35,556
staring at four walls
and wondering how you missed it.

1759
01:40:36,255 --> 01:40:39,290
How you let yourself
be so blinded by your ego

1760
01:40:39,921 --> 01:40:42,331
that you convinced yourself
that you were one step ahead

1761
01:40:42,422 --> 01:40:45,127
when you were always two steps behind.

1762
01:40:49,821 --> 01:40:51,026
Dylan?

1763
01:40:51,821 --> 01:40:52,629
Wait a minute.

1764
01:40:54,055 --> 01:40:56,158
Dylan! How did this happen?

1765
01:41:03,822 --> 01:41:05,458
Dylan!

1766
01:41:05,622 --> 01:41:06,599
Why?

1767
01:41:07,355 --> 01:41:08,332
Why?

1768
01:41:12,355 --> 01:41:14,458
Oh, my God.

1769
01:41:15,489 --> 01:41:17,364
I did not see that coming.

1770
01:41:17,522 --> 01:41:18,727
That's impossible!

1771
01:41:18,822 --> 01:41:19,822
No way.

1772
01:41:19,922 --> 01:41:22,331
That was actually pretty good.

1773
01:41:22,755 --> 01:41:23,789
Thank you.

1774
01:41:24,256 --> 01:41:26,460
When I said,
"Always be the smartest guy in the room."

1775
01:41:26,555 --> 01:41:27,555
We were in agreement.

1776
01:41:27,856 --> 01:41:28,993
Okay. Right.

1777
01:41:29,389 --> 01:41:30,366
Henley.

1778
01:41:31,189 --> 01:41:32,996
I've never seen her speechless.

1779
01:41:33,089 --> 01:41:34,657
I take that as a huge compliment.

1780
01:41:35,389 --> 01:41:38,026
Hey, man,
I'm so sorry for kicking your ass. Really.

1781
01:41:38,822 --> 01:41:40,323
Hey, listen, for the record,

1782
01:41:40,523 --> 01:41:43,966
I have always been a 100% believer.

1783
01:41:44,189 --> 01:41:48,626
And the amount of energy I have expended
to keep these infidels on point...

1784
01:41:48,722 --> 01:41:50,723
Merritt, you're in.

1785
01:41:51,590 --> 01:41:52,624
God bless.

1786
01:41:52,756 --> 01:41:53,756
Come.

1787
01:41:54,856 --> 01:41:57,993
The real magic is taking
four strong solo acts

1788
01:41:58,223 --> 01:42:00,064
and making them all work together.

1789
01:42:00,323 --> 01:42:02,597
And that's exactly what you did.

1790
01:42:03,590 --> 01:42:04,624
So welcome.

1791
01:42:07,990 --> 01:42:10,025
Welcome to the Eye.

1792
01:43:17,224 --> 01:43:19,259
It was all connected.

1793
01:43:19,891 --> 01:43:22,869
Credit Republican. Tressler Insurance.

1794
01:43:32,258 --> 01:43:33,530
And Elkhorn?

1795
01:43:33,657 --> 01:43:35,566
What's the connection to Shrike?

1796
01:43:38,091 --> 01:43:41,262
Elkhorn started as a safe manufacturer.

1797
01:43:41,624 --> 01:43:43,727
They used cheap steel.

1798
01:43:45,358 --> 01:43:46,596
They cut corners.

1799
01:43:46,724 --> 01:43:49,930
When he got
to the bottom of the river, the safe warped.

1800
01:43:50,024 --> 01:43:51,366
And he was trapped.

1801
01:43:52,924 --> 01:43:54,596
He was your father.

1802
01:43:56,558 --> 01:43:57,864
Of course.

1803
01:43:58,291 --> 01:44:00,200
I was 12 years old.

1804
01:44:00,291 --> 01:44:01,667
And from that moment on,

1805
01:44:02,024 --> 01:44:04,559
I created a persona.

1806
01:44:05,225 --> 01:44:07,100
I planned. I worked out every detail.

1807
01:44:07,191 --> 01:44:10,465
But the one thing
that I couldn't imagine happening

1808
01:44:10,924 --> 01:44:12,061
was you.

1809
01:44:13,625 --> 01:44:16,569
I know that the logical conclusion for you

1810
01:44:17,225 --> 01:44:19,760
is to take this case to its resolution.

1811
01:44:20,025 --> 01:44:23,060
And for you to turn me in.

1812
01:44:28,191 --> 01:44:29,225
Yeah.

1813
01:44:31,226 --> 01:44:35,034
But you know how I feel
about resolution and logic.

1814
01:44:36,425 --> 01:44:37,732
And you also know

1815
01:44:38,492 --> 01:44:42,800
that I think some things
are best left unexplained.

1816
01:44:49,459 --> 01:44:51,232
One more secret to lock away.

1817
01:45:18,693 --> 01:45:20,170
Come in close.

1818
01:45:20,693 --> 01:45:21,898
Closer.

1819
01:45:21,993 --> 01:45:24,231
Because now you know our secret.

1820
01:45:24,326 --> 01:45:26,668
We could be anywhere. Watching you.

1821
01:45:27,292 --> 01:45:30,930
We're looking for someone
to help us with our next trick.

1822
01:45:31,026 --> 01:45:33,526
On the count of three, open your eyes

1823
01:45:33,626 --> 01:45:35,570
and tell me what you see.

1824
01:45:36,593 --> 01:45:37,627
One.

1825
01:45:37,793 --> 01:45:38,770
Two...
