Yeah.

00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,129
Go ahead, I'm going in. One down.

00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,547

Okay.

33
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,634
Dang, I'm out. Come on, back me up.

34
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:16,427
Ah! They dropped a smoke screen.

35
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,346
I can't keep 'em out.

36
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,973
- Ah, I died!
- He's moving in.

37
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,558
I'll shoot 'em down. Move over.

38
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:23,726
Okay, I'll take the stairs then.

39
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:27,272
No, I died. They're closing in on you.

40
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,731
They're all gonna die.

Go, Diarrhea! Go, Diarrhea!
Go, Diarrhea! Go, Diarrhea!

42
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,112

- Go, Diarrhea!

43
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,072
- Assholes!
- Diarrhea!

00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,907

- Hello?

00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,500
Yeah, okay.

49
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:48,418
Yeah.

50
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,003
- I'll be right back.
- Be quick.

51
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:52,046
Yep.

Aw, thank you so much.

57
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,928
This is a freebie.

58
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,473
Are you, like, a psychic?

59
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:46,184
Oh, hey! Come by next week.

60
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:48,269
- Touch up the blonde.
- I need to?

61
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:50,939
Thank you. Thank you.

62
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:52,607
Hold on, I'm almost there.

63
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,901
We're playing now.

64
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,402
And make it quick.

65
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,862
- Uh-huh.
- Speed pedal.

66
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:58,780
Okay.

67
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,408
Stop, that's enough.

68
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:05,078
- Why are you messing with me?
- Stop!

69
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:07,455
Hmm?

70
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,334
- Oh.
- Stop fighting.

71
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:13,002
What's going on?

72
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,548
Son of a bitch!

73
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:21,594
Come here, you little...

74
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,596
Come at me. Goddamn it!

75
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:25,682
Whoa.

76
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,642
Asshole!

77
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,019
Oh, huh.

78
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,854
- Get off me! Get off me!
- Stop fighting me.

79
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,523
I said, get off! Fuck you!

80
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,566
Let go...

81
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,111
Fine, I'll go with you.

82
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:45,159
Damn it.

83
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,413
- I won't cuff you, so let's go quietly.
- All right.

84
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,209
Fucking shit!

85
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,502
Fuck!

86
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:55,503
You fucker!

87
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:56,587
Hey, hey!

88
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:58,965
Asshole!

89
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,969
Asshole!

90
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,679
- Fucker!
- Hey, stop, stop!

91
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,306
Break it up! Break it up!

92
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,809
- He's really hurt.
- What the fuck do you want?

93
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:11,686
Son of a bitch!

94
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:15,732
- You piece of...
- That's enough.

95
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,818
You want some?!

96
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,326
What's his deal?

97
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,287
Oh.

98
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,707
- Whoa. Are you all right?
- Yeah.

99
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,835
- Thanks for your help.
- Sure.

100
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:38,796
This could have ended very differently.
I can't thank you enough.

101
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,174
It was no problem at all.

102
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,342
On the count of three.

103
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,010
{\an8}SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROBATION OFFICE

104
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,054
{\an8}One, two, three.

105
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,556
- He's tall and buff as hell.
- Mm-hmm.

106
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,309
- Thank you for all you've done.
- Of course.

107
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:52,810
- Get home safely.
- Yes, ma'am.

108
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:56,856
- I'd like to introduce you to my director.
- Hello.

109
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,441
- Welcome, Jung-do-ssi.
- Oh.

110
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,526
I'm in charge
of the Electronic Monitoring Division.

111
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,237
I'm Director Kim Sun-min.
It's great to meet you.

112
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,238
Likewise.

113
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,075
Would you be able to spare me
a few minutes right now?

114
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,451
Uh-huh.

115
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:14,624
There are about 5,000 former inmates
wearing electronic ankle tags nationwide.

116
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:18,878
People who have committed violent crimes,
like homicide and sexual violence.

117
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,047
And many are re-offenders.

118
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,466
Which is why
there are probation officers like me.

119
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,010
We monitor the re-offenders 24-7,

120
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,221
utilizing electronic anklets, with GPS.

121
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,681
Ah, so then the guy that I helped was a...

122
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,101
That was Supervisor Cho
you previously helped.

123
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,560
He's our martial arts officer.

124
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:39,148
The former inmates we monitor can
cause trouble every now and again though.

125
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,191
Mmm.

126
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:43,569
When something like that happens,
we have to get to the spot fast,

127
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,071
to ensure that everyone is safe.

128
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:47,490
Ah, but as we get up there in age...

129
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,911
...we're not all as physically capable
of catching them as we'd like.

130
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:53,037
Mm.

131
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:56,499
So therefore, each officer teams up
with a strong young partner.

132
00:06:56,582 --> 00:07:00,420
Typically, they're called
martial arts officers.

133
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,713
Ah, martial arts officer. Oh.

134
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,716
Jung-do-ssi, may I ask
what do you do for work?

135
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,301
I deliver.

136
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,762
My <i>abeoji</i> runs a chicken shop.

137
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:13,516
That's surprising because Supervisor Cho
made it sound like you do tae kwon do

138
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,935
or judo professionally,
you were so impressive.

139
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,604
- Do you?
- Not for a living.

140
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,691
But in both tae kwon do and judo,
I'm a third <i>dan.</i>

141
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,443
- Wow.
- Kendo too.

142
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,194
- I'm a third <i>dan</i>.
- Wow.

143
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,531
Can I please ask you a favor?

144
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,782
No.

145
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,370
Of course. Yes, please, ask away.

146
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,749
The thing is,
the martial arts officers in our division

147
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,752
are currently on
a triple-shift rotation schedule.

148
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,921
But because of Supervisor Cho's injuries,

149
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:47,842
the two other martial arts officers
now have to pull 12-hour shifts.

150
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:48,759
Mmm.

151
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:51,345
That means they have to work for 12 hours

152
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:54,015
and come back to work
12 hours later, on repeat.

153
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:56,476
- Yeah, that's pretty intense.
- It is.

154
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,353
The work we do is somewhat difficult.

155
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,064
Realistically, it's near impossible
to find someone

156
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:05,485
to fill in just for the five weeks
Supervisor Cho is recovering.

157
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,862
But he told me, when he saw you

158
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:11,908
and how you were... handling
the former inmate with such ease,

159
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,203
he thought that it would be
nothing short of a miracle

160
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,498
if you might be willing to help us out.

161
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:22,001
Oh. Uh, but would I even qualify though?

162
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:23,878
Yeah, you're pretty much in.

163
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,548
Tae kwon do, hapkido, judo, or kendo,

164
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,634
and because you have
a third <i>dan</i> behind you,

165
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,260
you'll definitely be in.

166
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,304
Jung-do-ssi, your skills
are more than enough.

167
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:35,139
Uh, but is it

168
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,934
something I'll have fun doing?

169
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,394
That's the most important thing for me.

170
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,104
Well,

171
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:46,108
something "fun" can be defined differently
for each individual.

172
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:50,530
But I can say, it's such a rewarding job
and work we're proud of.

173
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,574
What we do helps keep civilians safe.

174
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:54,784
But...

175
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:59,038
Is that, um, something cool?

176
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,292
Yeah, it is.

177
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,629
It's something where you'll learn a lot,

178
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:09,382
and by working with us,
you could have fun too.

179
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:10,299
Hmm.

180
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,762
I know about this because
I've done research for my writing.

181
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:17,598
You get an anklet because of murder
or another violent crime.

182
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:20,518
Most of what you'd do is chase
and catch people. It might be a good fit.

183
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,353
- Why?
- Adrenaline.

184
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,689
- I think you'd like it too.
- For sure.

185
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,570
What do you think about me
filling in for a martial arts officer?

186
00:09:30,653 --> 00:09:33,114
The triple shift sounds pretty rough.

187
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:35,741
- Why do you think it'd be rough?
- It'll ruin his sleep cycle.

188
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,493
Diarrhea is in great shape.

189
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,328
- I'll be fine.
- Might be too intense.

190
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,247
Can you stop changing your mind?

191
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,041
- Stop telling me what to do.
- Go ahead and try.

192
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,793
Thank you.

193
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,715
They told me I'd have to chase
and catch the guys if necessary.

194
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,925
But what do you think?

195
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:57,388
I'd be happy to see you take on
a new challenge and learn things.

196
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,391
You got a commendation,
and I'm proud of you.

197
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,144
You are?

198
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,439
Yeah, and, uh, I'm on board.

199
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:09,317
I'll be able to manage the restaurant,
so worry about you.

200
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,282
Sounds good.

201

SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROBATION OFFICE

202
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,417
Can I have everyone's attention?

203
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,253
Meet Lee Jung-do.

204
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:32,590
While Supervisor Cho is recovering,
he'll be helping us out.

205
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:35,092
Let's welcome him
with a warm round of applause.

206
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,010
Hello.

207
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,724
This is our senior martial arts officer,
Huh Dong-won.

208
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:42,808
Hello.

209
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:46,312
Supervisor Huh will be showing you
how to use the program.

210
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,189
- Great.
- Take good care of him.

211
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,857
- No worries.
- Mm-hmm.

212
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,359
All right.

213
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,819
These numbers here
are the former inmates we monitor.

214
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,030
Oh...

215
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:58,699
The people here include
someone who raped a ten-year-old boy

216
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,451
and someone who killed his own parents.

{\an8}JANG HO-SIK
87%/HOMICIDE

218
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,790
When the anklet battery drops to 30%,

219
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:07,875
those green icons turn yellow.

220
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:09,877
And when that happens,

221
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,755
we call them and persuade them nicely
to charge up their anklet.

222
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:17,343
So, uh, what do you think's the next step
if they won't comply?

223
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,430
Go there?

224
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:22,348
- Nice.
- We go there.

225
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,349
Right.

226
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:26,519
You'll be overwhelmed
if I explain everything at once.

227
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:27,853
For now,

228
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,981
if you're unsure of anything,
just ask Director Kim.

229
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:32,733
I will. Thanks.

230
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:33,859
No problem.

231
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:51,001
Hey there, I'm calling
because your battery's down to 30% now.

232
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,586
It would be good to charge it.

233
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,588
Oh, you're out with a friend?

234
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,674
I think he's doing better
than we expected.

235
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:59,135
Really? I'm so glad to hear that.

236
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,145
Hmm?

237
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,148

30%/SEX CRIME

239
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,693
{\an8}DATE OF BIRTH: MAY 24, 2003

240
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:16,777
He's 20?

241
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:20,448
How did it go?

242
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:24,785
Choi Jong-hwa-ssi swore at me
and pushed me when I told him to go home,

243
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,912
so you could say I struggled a little.

244
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,708
I was hoping he would just listen to me.

245
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,378
I wish he would seriously stop doing that.

246
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,220
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Oh.

247
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,931
- Is this... Lee Yang-ho-ssi's phone?
- <i>Yes.</i>

248
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,601
I'm just calling as a reminder

249
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,394
to make sure that you charge...

250
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,938
- <i>Who is it?
- I didn't order</i> jjajangmyeon.

251
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,315
Hello?

252
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,193
<i>Jjajangmyeon?</i>

253
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:58,861
REDIAL

254
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,283
Oh, the call got disconnected.

255
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:07,536
I heard you the first time,
fucking bitch. Hang up.

256
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,079
Hello?

257
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:18,130
<i>This customer is
not receiving calls at this time.</i>

258
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,965
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

259
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,509
- <i>Extra charges may apply.</i>
- Hmm.

260
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,637
Mm-hmm.

261
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:26,263
- Try texting.
- Okay.

262
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:27,181
- Also...
- Director Kim.

263
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,017
We should go. He's ignoring me.

264
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:31,894
Who? And go where?

265
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:36,857
Lee Yang-ho-nim, he... hung up on me twice,
and now he's not answering my calls.

266
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:39,401
- When was Lee Yang-ho released?
- Three months ago.

267
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:42,363
He seemed to be on his best behavior.
I met with him the other day.

268
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:45,366
- All right, give Jung-do his equipment.
- Yes, sir.

269
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,576
- I'll meet you at the parking lot.
- You got it.

270
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,082
- Come with me.
- Oh, sure.

271
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,423
- Put this armor on.
- Whoa.

272
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,133
It's heavy.

273
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,849
- So this vest can really stop a knife?
- It prevents slashing injuries.

274
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,101
But if the point is direct,
you'll probably bruise.

275
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:15,062
Your bodycam needs to be
turned on before you get started.

276
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,648
- Oh.
- Here's your Taser.

277
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,069
I'm allowed to use one?

278
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:24,238
Director Kim has to give you the go-ahead.

279
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:25,781
- Cool.
- Put this in here.

280
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,704
How'd he end up in jail?

281
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:33,372
He raped a middle-school girl.

282
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,875
Whoa.

283
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,755
Do you think I could shock him a little?

284
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,591
Only if it's absolutely necessary.

285
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:49,388
Our priority is to keep watch
over these guys and... prevent trouble.

286
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,181
Ah, right.

287
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,655
What is it?
Did you see something, Jung-do-ssi?

288
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,659
Right there. 201.

289
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:11,994
It's probably there.

290
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,457
I've delivered to so many buildings
that I can roughly figure out the layout.

291
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,751
See that window?

292
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,252
No security grille.

293
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,962
But that window has one.

294
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,757
He removed it,
so it's easier for him to run away.

295
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,010
I bet if you knock on his door,

296
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:30,679
he'll probably jump down there,

297
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,765
and that's where I can pounce on him.

298
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:35,601
And what if he runs out the front door?

299
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,271
Then I'll meet you there.

300
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,107
Yeah?

301
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:46,070
Hmm.

302
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:51,825
Wait a minute.

303
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,879
Yang-ho-kun.

304
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,173
- Open the door.
- It's nothing. Ignore it.

305
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,549
I know you're inside.

306
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,643
- I know that you're in there.
- Goddamn it!

307
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:19,311
What the fuck does he want?!

308
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,271
Yang-ho-kun, I know you're...

309
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,107
Fuck!

310
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,359
You son of a bitch!

311
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:26,986
I told you to leave me alone.

312
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,779
- Please help!
- I'm trying to sleep!

313
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,322
- Once I open this...
- Open the door!

314
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,408
Why don't you get lost,
you stupid piece of shit?

315
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,660
Open the door!

316
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,163
What's going on in there? Hello?

317
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:41,583
O... open the door!

318
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,044
<i>Ahjussi</i>, please help me!

319
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,089
- Ah, shit.

320
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:53,846
Fuck.

321
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,868
Whoa, man!

322
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:17,536
Wow.

323
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:20,998
Oh, Director Kim.

324
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,296
Lee Yang-ho-ssi, you're under arrest

325

of your probation officer.

327
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,304
You have the right to remain silent.

328
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:39,850
{\an8}Anything you say can and will be used

00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,264
- Huh?
- Oh shit.

337
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,225
Hey!

338
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,726
Oh shit, man!

339
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,526
Ow!

Ow! Shit!

Son of a bitch.

342
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:34,905
Just... just let me go!

343
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:37,282
- Let you go?!
- Yeah. What's your fucking problem?

344
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:38,534
- You crazy...
- Calm down.

345
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,701
Just try to hit me!

346
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,286
Look at me. Hey.

347
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,289
He's trying to provoke you.
You need to calm down.

348
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:47,793
I'm not trying to provoke you,
you piece of shit. Don't hold back!

349
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,795
- Hey, shut your big mouth!
- Stop! Don't.

350
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,171
Calm down, please.

351
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,506
I won't repeat myself.

352
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:55,134
I know. I get it. I understand. Please.

353
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,677
Calm down.

354
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,845
I know. I get it.

355
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,233
Jung-do-ssi.

356
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:14,736
- I know. I'm sorry.
- Why are you sorry?

357
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,821
That was cool.

358
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:16,864
Thank you.

359
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,700
That was a long day, yeah?
Can I buy you dinner?

360
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,994
Oh. Uh...

361
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:25,289
I'm, uh, supposed to meet up
with my friends soon.

362
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:28,083
- Oh, some other time, then.
- Could you take us all out for a meal?

363
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:31,753
Oh, sure!

364
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,463
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

365
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,883
- Thank you.
- Oh man, it's no big deal. Come on.

366
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,518
Diarrhea's boss is
taking us out for <i>samgyeopsal.</i>

367
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,853
Yay!

CAST IRON KIMCHI AND PORK BELLY

00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,108
Hello.

370
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,402
Oh, yes. Hello. Hi.

371
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:57,779
I'm Writer K.
I've heard so much about you.

372
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,782
Yes, I'm Kim Sun-min.
It's so nice to meet you all.

373
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,826
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello, I'm Moisture.

374
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,329
- Thank you for inviting us all.
- Sure.

375
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,248
How did you get "Moisture"
as your nickname?

376
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,584
His nose always looks wet.
Hence the nickname.

377
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,960
It does.

378
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,004
It's grease, or maybe it's sweat,
but nobody knows.

379
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:15,797
I'm pretty sure
it's half-sweat, half-grease.

380
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,257
I see!

381
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,926
This is Earthworm.

382
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,261
- "Earthworm"?
- Because I squirm when I'm stepped on.

383
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,596
Like an earthworm.

384
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:23,889
He's too nice for his own good.

385
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:26,141
- He will never get angry at you.
- Oh!

386
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,352
All right, I think It's time to eat.

387
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:29,895
- Yeah.
- Please, sit.

388
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,313
- Yes, thank you.
- Go ahead.

389
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,857
What are you in the mood for?

390
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,653
We can start with the combination

391
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,155
of delectable <i>minari</i>
and flavorful <i>samgyeopsal</i>,

392
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,907
then segue into the spicy kimchi <i>jeongol</i>

393
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,826
before we wrap it up
with the delicious crispy <i>bbokeumbap.</i>

394
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,579
A perfectly balanced meal,
rich in healthy carbs, protein, and fat.

395
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,666
Yes, please, order all that.

396
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:51,917
- Thank you.
- No prob.

397
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,587
He described it like a story.

398
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:56,672
- Twenty servings?
- Yes.

399
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,715
And we'll get five servings
of kimchi <i>jeongol.</i>

400
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,800
Twenty-five in total?

401
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,677
Including the five servings
of the <i>jeongol</i>.

402
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:04,680
Hand me your glass.

403
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,057
Oh, I don't have
the enzymes to break down alcohol.

404
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,350
Oh.

405
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,435
And I'm more fun sober than anyone wasted.

406
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,145
Okay. Here.

407
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,855
- This looks so good.
- Thank you.

408
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,732
It's so nice to meet you, Moisture-ssi.

409
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,192
- You too, Earthworm-ssi.
- Same.

410
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,780
- All right, shall we drink up?
- Yes.

411
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,408
- All righty.
- Cheers.

412
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:33,417
I did some research on probation officers
while I was working on one of my scripts.

413
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,334
Oh, nice.

414
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:38,005
I know that it's a very stressful job
that involves many dangerous tasks.

415
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:40,382
Why did you decide to go into probation?

416
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:43,093
I was in a car accident when I was little.

417
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,928
Ah...

418
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,763
Our car wasn't even moving.

419
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:50,892
But someone suddenly came
and crashed into the back of our car.

420
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,811
The rear doors all caved in,

421
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:56,023
and I couldn't even move my legs
because they were completely stuck.

422
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,149
Whoa.

423
00:21:57,232 --> 00:22:00,235
And the engine caught on fire. Whoa.

424
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,486
I was only ten years old.

425
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,032
A ten-year-old had to
think about death in that moment.

426
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,783
"Whoa! This is how I die?"

427
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:09,411
I would've played video games nonstop
instead of studying

428
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,787
if I knew I'd die like this."

429
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,914
I couldn't stop thinking about
all my New Year's money

430
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:15,334
I had stashed in my drawer.
I was so upset about it!

431
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,921
Anyway, um...

432
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,923
...some cops arrived to save us,

433
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:25,635
and they ripped the whole door off,
working to save me.

434
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:26,803
Oh...

435
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:30,640
I decided that I would become
a police officer,

436
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:34,436
to save people and pay forward
the help I had received that day.

437
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,521
- Mm.
- But I had an issue.

438
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,649
The growth plate in my leg
was damaged in the accident.

439
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,735
- Oh man.
- So my left leg is shorter than my right.

440
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:45,530
Because of that, I knew I wouldn't be able
to run around and catch criminals,

441
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:46,948
and...

442
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:50,035
...and then I wondered...
what would come second?

443
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:53,497
So then
I learned about probation officers.

444
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,414
Mm.

445
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,875
The fact that I could contribute
to reducing recidivism

446
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,461
got me deeply motivated to do this work.

447
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,713
Then once I got married
and became a father,

448
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,216
um, my job became more meaningful to me.

449
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:05,467
Why?

450
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,844
There were a lot
of sex offenses involving children

451
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,138
among the formerly incarcerated
that we monitor.

452
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,099
It's my dream

453
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:16,228
that we can have a world where
children are always protected and safe.

454
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:19,147
- Wow.
- Wow.

455
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:26,571
Oh!

456
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,454
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

457
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,248
All right. Let's eat!

458
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,335
Uh, we're wondering

459
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:43,213
if we might be able
to call you our <i>hyung-nim</i>.

460
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,297
Garlic.

461
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:47,592
But the thing is,
you have to pass a little test first.

462
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:50,720
This lettuce wrap is
filled with our loyalty,

463
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,140
our sincerity, and friendship.

464
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,433
And all that we need

465
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,561
is for you to eat this in one bite.

466
00:23:57,644 --> 00:24:00,647
- Say ah!
- Ah!

467
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,316
Ah!

468
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,820
Ah!

469
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,365
<i>Hyung-nim,
hyung-nim, hyung-nim...</i>

470
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,033
This is way too big!

471
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,453
...<i>hyung-nim,
hyung-nim, hyung-nim,</i>

472
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,496
<i>hyung-nim, hyung-nim, hyung-nim,</i>

473
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,708
<i>hyung-nim, hyung-nim, hyung-nim,
hyung-nim, hyung-nim, hyung-nim,</i>

474
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,042
<i>hyung-nim, hyung-nim...</i>

475
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,838
Yeah!

476
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:26,173
Yeah!

477
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,425
Yeah!

478
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:34,848
LOW BATTERY DETECTED

479
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,684
HAN JUN-GU
30%/KIDNAPPING

480
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,858
<i>...receiving calls at this time.</i>

481
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:47,694
Yo, Han Jun-gu-ssi's battery is at 30%,
but his phone is off.

482
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,282
What is this?

483
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:53,825
Who is it?

484
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,536
{\an8}MIN DO-WOONG

485
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,288
That was such a great meal.

486
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:59,998
- Thank you.
- What are you doing?

487
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:02,375
- Thank you for the dinner, <i>hyung-nim</i>!
- I'm blushing.

488
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,586
I can't imagine if I had bought you steak.

489
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,963
There's a beef restaurant
just up the street if you want!

490
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,549
ASSISTANT MANAGER YOON DONG-JU

491
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,010
Mm-hmm?

492
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:14,012
Director Kim, where are you right now?

493
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:14,971
What's going on?

494
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:18,475
One of the former inmates is MIA,
so we have to go track him down,

495
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:21,853
but Min Do-woong-ssi broke the rules
and is somewhere in Seorin-dong,

496
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,772
but when I call, he's not answering me.

497
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:27,067
Actually, I'm in Seorin-dong now.
I can go.

498
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:30,237
Um, what was it he did time for?

499
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,322
He served 20 years
for second-degree murder.

500
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,490
Released three months ago.

501
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:35,951
Do you know
anybody he has a grudge against out here?

502
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,203
<i>That I haven't figured out yet,
I'm sorry.</i>

503
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,789
Don't worry about it. I got it.

504
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,418
<i>Hyung-nim</i>, we can probably get there
in five minutes if we run.

505
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:49,506
How about one minute?

506
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:54,594
Ooh! Oh!

507
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,392
CRIME CATEGORY: MANSLAUGHTER

508
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,439
You guys stay in the car. You hear?

509
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,024
- Yes.
- We'll be back.

510
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:14,990
- That way?
- Yes.

511
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,293
- What's happening?
- He's cut off the anklet.

512
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:27,586
How do we track him down?

513
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,379
- We go to the address.
- Okay.

514
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,300
Do! Here.

515
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,179
He cut it off with a knife.

516
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:49,941
Should we call the police?

517
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,068
No, he can't be far,
so let's catch him quickly.

518
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,697
<i>Hyung,</i> Moisture has a drone.
Why don't we try that?

519
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,325
- Think it would help?
- It's worth a shot.

520
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,418
- Oh, here. You can follow it here.
- Oh.

521
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:10,879
Whoa!

522
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,135
This way. Can it go this way?

523
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:18,553
Yup.

524
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:23,975
This must be him.

525
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:25,727
Where's he going?

526
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,480
I'll go after him, <i>hyung</i>.

527
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:30,357
- I'll tag along.
- No, no.

528
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,900
I'll run and get him. I'll be quick.

529
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:33,693
He's got a knife!

530
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:35,654
Don't you worry about that.

531
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,241
After all, it's my duty
as a martial arts officer

532
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,201
to protect my partner.

533
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,244
I'll be back.

534
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:45,497
Dumbass.

535
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,459
Put an earbud in.
This way, I'll give directions.

536
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:50,460
Oh, okay.

537
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:52,045
I'll be right back!

538
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:53,880
Be careful.

539
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,681
Go straight ahead. Keep going.

540
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,641
<i>Make a left.
You passed it. You passed the alley.</i>

541
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:05,975
Go back, back, back.

542
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,111
- <i>Hurry, faster.</i>
- Keep going?

543
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,696
<i>Yes, keep going.</i>

544
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:19,114
<i>Hey, Jung-do, I'm sorry.</i>

545
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,282
<i>But can you go a bit faster?</i>

546
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,618
You're really close,
almost there.

547
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,413
A little faster and you'll make it
to him in no time. Go to the right.

548
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:28,456
<i>On your right.</i>

549
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,166
On my right? Right, where is he?

550
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,543
Where? Which right?

551
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:33,878
Do you see the two buildings
with rooftops on your right?

552
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,505
You'll see him past those buildings.

553
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:37,549
- Two rooftops? Where?
- You don't see them at all?

554
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,677
One, two. Okay.

555
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,857
You bastard!
Come out, you son of a bitch!

556
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,027
Come out!

557
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,863
Ji Hyeok-jun, die, die, die!

558
00:28:59,946 --> 00:29:01,364
Come out and face me!

559
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:03,908
I'm gonna kill you! Come out!

560
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:05,744
Min Do-woong-ssi!

561
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,415
What?

562
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:12,792
Hi.

563
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,423
I'm a mar...
martial arts officer.

564
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:19,883
And?

565
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,136
I'm here to finish it all off tonight.

566
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,056
Yeah, that's why I'm here.

567
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:30,018
Let's go back quietly.

568
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,686
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

569
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,860
Goddamn it!

570
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:47,869
Jung-do, what's wrong? Jung-do-ya?

571
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,204
Are you all right?

572
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:06,429
You can come now, <i>hyung</i>.

573
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:10,099
Coming now. I'll be right there.

574
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:15,939
Ow, shit.

575
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:17,690
Hey!

576
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:21,110
Leave or I'm gonna kill myself.

577
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,782
<i>Hyung</i>, I need your help.

578
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,036
<i>What's going on?</i>

579
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:32,330
Um, right now,
he's holding a knife to his throat.

580
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,965
Jung-do-ya, I need you to be my voice.

581
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,007
What?

582
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:46,219
<i>Relay my words to him.</i>

583
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:47,303
Leave!

584
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:48,888
Uh-huh.

585
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,182
Min Do-woong-ssi.

586
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:53,893
"Min Do-woong-ssi."

587
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:57,730
It seems like your day was really hard.

588
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,943
"It seems like your day was really hard."

589
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:05,905
<i>Did you</i>

590
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:08,992
<i>get into a fight with a friend?</i>

591
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:12,829
"Did you get into a fight with a friend?"

592
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,380
Late... lately,

593
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:26,009
I swear I'm trying really hard
to be a good guy lately.

594
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,220
But that son of a bitch,

595
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,515
he kept making fun of me
in front of the others,

596
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,183
for wearing that damn ankle tag,

597
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,769
<i>and... it's really unfair.</i>

598
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:39,981
<i>It makes me so angry
that I can't even sleep.</i>

599
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,693
And I wanna kill him off,

600
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,029
and then I'll die!

601
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:47,697
Do-woong-nim.

602
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:49,449
"Do-woong-nim."

603
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,244
"I understand you."

604
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:55,038
"Life was already so difficult."

605
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,249
And more piled on top of it all,

606
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:00,043
it really tested your limits.

607
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,253
"If you give up your life,

608
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:06,925
you'd be wasting
those twenty years you spent repenting."

609
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,510
"Wouldn't that be unfair to you?"

610
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,102
You might've slipped up
and needed a drink too.

611
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:20,897
I'll write a report that's light.

612
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,274
You'll only get a minor penalty.

613
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,860
"I promise, I'll do my best."

614
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,491
"Can I ask you to drop the knife?"

615
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,164
You mustn't repeat the same mistake.

616
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:40,458
"You have to win at your life."

617
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,544
"Hang in there just a little longer."

618
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,714
"That day will come
when you can remove the anklet."

619
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,386
"Until that day arrives,
I promise I'll be here."

620
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:54,347
I mean that.

621
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:57,976
"I mean that."

622
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,454
- I'm home.
- Hey, you.

623
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,791
- How was work?
- Not too bad.

624
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:26,254
Well, my director...

625
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:29,340
He's really

626
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:31,884
kinda cool.

627
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:34,846
I'm glad.

628
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,765
- Go wash up. Let's eat these apples.
- All right.

629
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,310
<i>Beginning in May 1998,</i>

630
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:45,648
{\an8}<i>Kang Ki-jung has managed to elude
the police dragnet for four years.</i>

631
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:50,278
{\an8}<i>During that time, he sexually assaulted
15 young girls under the age of 13.</i>

632
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,114
Oh man, what a sick piece of work.

633
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:54,615
{\an8}<i>And given the fact</i>

634
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:58,244
{\an8}<i>that he has committed sexual offenses
against these young children,</i>

635
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:02,415
{\an8}<i>we can say that Kang Ki-jung has
a higher rate of recidivism upon release,</i>

{\an8}<i>even when compared to other sex offenders.</i>

637
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,920
We need a task force. Any ideas?

638
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:11,674
Three teams with a probation
and martial arts officer

639
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:15,344
on a triple-shift rotation schedule
to monitor Kang Ki-jung around the clock.

640
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:16,596
A triple shift?

641
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,223
Each of our probation officers

642
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:22,310
has to monitor
over twenty former inmates at the moment.

643
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,729
If we have to monitor Kang Ki-jung
on top of that,

644
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:28,024
we won't be able
to closely monitor the others properly.

645
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:31,319
I know that you're all
already working overtime.

646
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:35,323
The problem is that it's not that easy
to get a budget increase,

647
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,866
but I'll push harder for it.

648
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:42,246
Thank you, come again.

649
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,248
Have a nice day.

Could I borrow you for a sec?

He touched a young server.

She looked uncomfortable,

You were right. We have a problem.

00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:47,974
Huh?

684
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,308
Did he cut it off?

685
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:52,228
I think he's somewhere with no connection.

686
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:55,064
Where was he when you saw him last?

687
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,827
Uh, sorry for barging in.

688
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,955
Was this man here in this restaurant?

Uh-huh.

690
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:13,291
Which way did he go?

691
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:17,712
Left or right?

692
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,714

Oh, right.

694
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:24,176
He told me that today was his birthday
and invited me over to his place,

695
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,094
but I declined.

696
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,096
Okay.

697
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,723
- Thank you.
- Thanks for your time.

698
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:34,854
I'll go down here. You go there.

Okay, yeah.

00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,658
If it gets too hot,
just let me know, okay?

I was my happiest when I was on stage.

752
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,853
Rehearsing with my friends,
sweating together,

spraying saliva on each other

Even if you're doing things

inspiring others is much better.

It's an incredible feeling

759
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:29,083
when the passionate energy
that's in your heart

can be connected and shared
inside someone else's heart too.

00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:53,524
And the Ministry of Economy and Finance
will increase budget

769
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:55,526
for two additional martial arts officers.

770
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:58,612

Fourteen out of fifteen sexual offenses
Kang Ki-jung committed

00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:09,998
all took place immediately before

Whoever monitors him
during the day is the most important.

I will take on the responsibility.

00:45:18,674 --> 00:45:21,885
will you be all right with a double shift?
What about your kid?

779
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,974

We are invincible together.

800
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,159
<i>Kang Ki-jung,</i>

801
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:30,454
<i>a man who served a 20-year sentence
for sexually assaulting 15 children,</i>

802
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:31,622
<i>will be released today.</i>

803
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:35,834
<i>For the next ten years, he will wear
a GPS-enabled electronic tracking device.</i>

804
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:37,586
Jung-do-ya.

805
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:39,004
What is that?

806
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,091
- Try it on.
- This is mine?

807
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:48,680
Hold on.

808

MINISTRY OF JUSTICE

809
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:55,729
PROBATION & PAROLE

810
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,566
I appreciate this.

811
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:13,288
JEONAN PRISON

812
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:34,309
Kang Ki-jung-ssi,
you must never deliberately remove,

813
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:36,436
damage, or disable the ankle monitor

814
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,606
by jamming signals
or manipulating our data, and so on.

815
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:43,026
You will be under 24-hour surveillance
from our probation officers

816
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:46,405
following your release, and we may track
your movements whenever we decide.

817
00:47:46,488 --> 00:47:47,322
Is that understood?

818
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:49,074
Yes.

819
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:51,618
Put your foot up,
whichever one you prefer.

820
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:10,304
You may now put your shoes on
and stand up.

821
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:17,811
You can use this phone
until you have the means to buy one.

822
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:28,780
We're leaving now.

823
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:39,166
<i>Kang Ki-jung, sex-offender of children,
will soon return to society</i>

824
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:41,209
<i>upon completing his 20-year sentence.</i>

825
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:44,421
<i>Many residents and members of civic groups
have been waiting in front of his house</i>

826
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:47,966
<i>since the early hours of the morning.
The police are also on the scene,</i>

827
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:50,344
<i>preparing to prevent
any altercations that may take place.</i>

828
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,638
Send Kang Ki-jung to Jeju Island!

829
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:54,723
Don't let that monster
in our neighborhood!

830
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:58,936
This is dangerous. Please stay calm.
Let us pass through. Move to the side.

831
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:01,021
Give him the death penalty!

832
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,606
Move to a different country!

833
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:03,899
Please move back!

834
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:06,443
Please stay calm.
Get out of the way.

835
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:09,488
- It's dangerous. Make way.
- Asshole!

836
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:12,741
Give Kang Ki-jung
the death penalty!

837
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:19,581
Are we paying taxes so rapists like him
can get a comfortable ride home?

838
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:20,707
Fuck that!

839
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,418
Death penalty!
Death penalty! Death penalty!

840
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:26,004
Death penalty!
Death penalty! Death penalty!

841
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,214
Stay back, stay back!

842
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:30,634
What are you...
You guys see this? What the hell?

843
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,844
I'm not the criminal! Let me go!

844
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:38,558
Death penalty!
Death penalty! Death penalty!

845
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:41,103
Death penalty! Death... Get off me!

846
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:42,396
Don't let him go!

847
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,731
- You fucking seeing this?!
- What's that guy doing?!

848
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,525
Move!
Get out of my way!

849
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,071
Please move back. Everyone, back.

850
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:59,079
Kang Ki-jung-ssi, is there anything
you'd like to say to the victims?

851
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:01,915
- Kang Ki-jung-ssi! Kang Ki-jung-ssi!
- Move it. Walk faster.

852
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:04,876
Answer me. Please answer
the question, Kang Ki-jung-ssi!

853
00:50:10,382 --> 00:50:12,009
What are you looking at?

854
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,179
Keep it moving.

855
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:18,473
- Get him inside.
- Come on.

856
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:27,232
This used to be
a quiet, peaceful neighborhood.

857
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:28,358
I know.

858
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:34,698
- All clear?
- Yes, I think so.

859
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:36,783
Hey, come on.

860
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:39,327
- Let's patrol this block one last time.
- Yeah, let's do it.

861
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:42,372
- Did you see him earlier?
- He's hard to miss.

862
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:44,374
- And his face is intimidating.
- It is.

863
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:47,836
All the residents in this area
must be terrified with him moving in.

864
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,360
What happened to you?!

865
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:14,821
You beefed up.

866
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:17,532
It helped me with my stress.

867
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,788
Here, put this on. It's a cool jacket.

868
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:29,961
Oh.

869
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:31,922
Let's go smoke on the roof.

870
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:33,590
Yeah, right.

871
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:38,595
Hey, I've been wearing this
for three years.

872
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:41,556
They can't detect your movements
going up or down in the same building.

873
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,559
You can go wherever you want
if it's under ten meters.

874
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:48,313
The GPS... is kind of a joke in accuracy.

875
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:08,041
- Man.
- Have you thought about it?

876
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:10,710
About the thing I wrote in my letter.

877
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:14,131
Yeah, let's do it.

878
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:37,195
He's on the move.

879
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:42,534
- Where's he going?
- <i>Hyung</i>, would it be okay if I go tail him?

880
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,953
- Right now?
- Yeah.

881
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:47,914
I think if we wait around,
we'll... end up behind.

882
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:57,215
I want you to always be careful.
Always keep your earphone in.

883
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:58,550
I'll be monitoring.

884
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:00,177
Okay.

885
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:04,389
I can't see him yet, <i>hyung</i>.

886
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:07,434
Kang Ki-jung hasn't stopped anywhere.
He's still walking.

887
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:08,810
Let me know when you spot him.

888
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:09,811
I will.

889
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:18,111
There he is.

890
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:21,239
- <i>Could you turn right here, please?</i>
- Sure.

891
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:24,659
Slow down. Please slow down
and drive slowly.

892
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:29,956
<i>Hyung,</i> Kang Ki-jung is
entering a building.

893
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,709
<i>- I'm getting out.</i>
- Okay, okay. Just be careful.

894
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,254
I will. Thank you.

895
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:37,172
Uh-huh.

896
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:00,528
I have no idea which way he went.

897
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:02,489
Can you tell me what you spot around you?

898
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:09,704
From the second to the fifth floors,
it's all kids' academies.

899
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:14,292
It's too early.
The kids will still be in school.

900
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:16,169
<i>I don't think he went up.</i>

901
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:18,213
I'll check underground.

902
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,956
I'll get straight to the point.

903
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:56,251
I distribute a very specific type
of video content.

904
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,296
You'll be creating videos with children,

905
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:03,174
and I'll take care of all the distribution
on the dark web.

906
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:06,594
I'll pay you ten million won
per ten-minute video.

907
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:12,392
Byung-soon-ssi will help you
record and edit the videos.

908
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:14,352
And as for the children,

909
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:16,229
we'll procure them for you.

910
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:18,148
You have absolutely

911
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,401
nothing to lose.

912
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:24,154
Sounds good to me.

913
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:29,576
Someone's here.

914
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:33,330
Who's that?

915
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:36,374
He must've followed me
because of the ankle monitor.

916
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:38,501
He can't see inside the car,
so don't move.

917
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,212
<i>Jung-do-ya, you still okay?</i>

918
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:43,006
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm still looking.

919
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:01,441
Five times five is 25.

920
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:04,569
All good.

921
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:09,908
I think that prick saw our license plate.

922
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:11,618
You'll take care of him, right?

923
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,995
I'll handle him quietly.

924
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:18,625
What's up? You find anything?

925
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:22,212
I can't find him. The parking lot is huge.
What should we do?

926
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:25,548
Jung-do-ya, I'll call Kang Ki-jung.

927
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,425
I'll put it on speaker,
so listen carefully.

928
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:28,551
Got it, yeah.

929
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:51,366
<i>Hello?</i>

930
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:53,368
<i>Kang Ki-jung-ssi?</i>

931
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:56,746
- <i>I'm calling from the probation office.</i>
- Yes, hello.

932
00:56:58,039 --> 00:57:00,959
<i>Uh, it took you quite a while
to answer the phone.</i>

933
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:03,420
Oh, sorry.

934
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:06,714
I'm not used to carrying one around,
so I didn't know you were calling.

935
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:08,591
<i>Oh, I see.</i>

936
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:12,762
Could you please tell me where you are?

937
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:14,973
Uh...

938
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:21,354
<i>Of course. I just stepped out
to have some</i> gimbap.

939
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:25,358
Ah, <i>gimbap</i>, huh?

940
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:28,278
I'll go there now. Buy me some time.

941
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:31,948
Oh, well, um, Kang Ki-jung-ssi,

942
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:36,077
<i>about your anklet.
If it's uncomfortable at all for you,</i>

943
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:38,913
<i>we can adjust the fit for you, no problem.</i>

944
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:41,332
<i>Would you like to make any adjustments?</i>

945
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:43,543
No, it fits fine.

946
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:50,258
Also, as a service,
we can provide support and resources

947
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:51,509
to help with your job search.

948
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:54,095
<i>What kind of job
do you think you might be looking for?</i>

949
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:55,138
I'm good on jobs.

950
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:03,855
He's sitting in the <i>gimbap</i> place.

951
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:07,025
Hmm, well, all right.

952
00:58:07,108 --> 00:58:09,527
Enjoy your meal, and, uh, from now on,

953
00:58:09,611 --> 00:58:12,238
please make sure
you answer your phone a little faster.

954
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:13,656
Sorry about that.

955

- Yeah.

960

It makes me anxious.

961
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:30,548
We can't tail him
every single time he leaves the house.

962

I know, but I'm gonna try my best.

969
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:50,360

It's for you. I figured you'd need it
while you're working.

- It's a pair of tactical gloves.

976
00:59:05,583 --> 00:59:07,126
Wow. This is awesome.

977
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:09,128
They look nice.

978
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:12,674
- I'll use them well. Thank you.
- Make sure you don't get hurt, all right?

979
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:13,591

Shouldn't we seal the door
and the windows so no sound escapes?

990

Don't you worry about that.

01:16:27,624 --> 01:16:31,086
He was able to remove the monitor,
but the police are tracking him down.

1117
01:16:32,129 --> 01:16:34,548
They're on the move now,
so we'll get him soon.

1118
01:16:35,382 --> 01:16:37,092
What about the girl?

1119
01:16:37,676 --> 01:16:38,594
Resting at home.

1120
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:43,223
How's...

1121
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:45,100
how's Director Kim?

1122
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:57,487
Director Kim's neck was broken,
and... he's undergoing surgery.

1123
01:16:58,405 --> 01:17:00,866
But doesn't breaking his neck mean

1124
01:17:01,658 --> 01:17:02,868
that he'll be paralyzed?

1125
01:17:03,368 --> 01:17:06,496
Thankfully, the injury didn't damage
any nerves, so he'll be all right.

1126
01:17:09,666 --> 01:17:11,835
It'll take him a while to recover though.

1127
01:17:19,801 --> 01:17:20,761
Jung-do-ssi.

1128
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:25,349
Cho Min-jo's been

1129
01:17:27,142 --> 01:17:28,268
declared brain-dead.

1130
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:32,814
The police have launched an investigation.

1131
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:35,859
He suffered

1132
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:38,779
from cardiac arrest.

1133
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:51,958
Supervisor Cho

1134
01:17:53,585 --> 01:17:55,754
had signed consent for organ donation,

1135
01:17:56,338 --> 01:17:57,255
and his family

1136
01:17:58,298 --> 01:18:00,300
would like to respect his decision.

1137
01:18:34,668 --> 01:18:37,170
This wraps up
the Brave Citizen Award Ceremony.

1138
01:18:37,254 --> 01:18:39,005
Thank you all for joining us today.

1139
01:18:41,591 --> 01:18:42,467
Thank you.

1140
01:18:44,511 --> 01:18:45,721
Excuse me.

1141
01:18:47,472 --> 01:18:50,350
You're... Min-ju's savior.

1142
01:18:50,434 --> 01:18:51,768
Ah, uh...

1143
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:54,104
Right, sorry, I'm her <i>emo</i>.

1144
01:18:54,604 --> 01:18:55,522
Ah.

1145
01:18:56,273 --> 01:18:57,107
Hello.

1146
01:18:57,190 --> 01:18:59,568
I apologize for not coming sooner.

1147
01:18:59,651 --> 01:19:01,278
Oh, no. No worries.

1148
01:19:01,361 --> 01:19:02,821
I wanted to, uh,

1149
01:19:03,363 --> 01:19:06,158
to thank you
for saving Min-ju's life the other day.

1150
01:19:06,241 --> 01:19:07,075
Oh.

1151
01:19:07,993 --> 01:19:08,827
Uh...

1152
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:11,747
Thank you.

1153
01:19:12,789 --> 01:19:14,207
Oh, and one more thing.

1154
01:19:15,792 --> 01:19:16,960
This is from Min-ju.

1155
01:19:17,043 --> 01:19:18,545
She asked me to give you this.

1156
01:19:18,628 --> 01:19:19,504
Uh...

1157
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:31,266
HELLO, UNCLE
I'M MIN-JU, THE GIRL YOU SAVED

1158
01:19:31,349 --> 01:19:33,769
BEFORE YOU SHOWED UP, I WAS REALLY SCARED

1159
01:19:37,230 --> 01:19:39,065
I THOUGHT I'D NEVER SEE MY PARENTS AGAIN

1160
01:19:39,149 --> 01:19:41,026
BUT THANKS TO YOU, I COULD SEE THEM AGAIN

1161
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:42,778
YOU EVEN GOT HURT SAVING ME
THANK YOU

1162
01:19:43,570 --> 01:19:45,197
Is Min-ju doing all right now?

1163
01:19:48,033 --> 01:19:50,952
She's still too scared
to leave the house for any reason.

1164
01:19:52,662 --> 01:19:54,915
She relives what happened in her dreams.

1165
01:19:55,916 --> 01:19:57,876
Even so,

1166
01:19:57,959 --> 01:19:59,920
when I talk about you with her,

1167
01:20:01,171 --> 01:20:03,173
she just perks right up.

1168
01:20:03,256 --> 01:20:04,382
She's staying strong.

1169
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:08,178
I came by to thank you for saving her.

1170
01:20:09,012 --> 01:20:10,388
I can't thank you enough.

1171
01:20:14,518 --> 01:20:16,853
{\an8}<i>Many people are saying that the punishment</i>

1172
01:20:16,937 --> 01:20:19,439
{\an8}<i>for serial rapist Kang Ki-jung
was far too light.</i>

1173
01:20:19,523 --> 01:20:21,566
{\an8}<i>What's your take on it, Professor Kim?</i>

1174
01:20:21,650 --> 01:20:23,902
{\an8}<i>It is true that our penalties
for sex offenders</i>

1175
01:20:23,985 --> 01:20:26,863
{\an8}<i>are considerably lighter when compared
to those of other countries.</i>

1176
01:20:26,947 --> 01:20:29,324
- <i>Right.
- A few years ago, attempts...</i>

1177
01:20:29,407 --> 01:20:31,076
- Hi!
- You're here!

1178
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:33,328
- Hey, dude. Have some pizza.
- I'm back.

1179
01:20:33,411 --> 01:20:34,621
No, I'm not hungry.

1180
01:20:35,205 --> 01:20:37,457
<i>...concerned that it might lead
to over-punishment.</i>

1181
01:20:37,541 --> 01:20:38,375
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

1182
01:20:38,959 --> 01:20:41,044
<i>I think we can all agree
that sexual assault,</i>

1183
01:20:41,127 --> 01:20:43,213
<i>especially sex crimes against children,</i>

1184
01:20:43,296 --> 01:20:46,341
<i>should never be tolerated
or forgiven, no matter what.</i>

1185
01:20:46,424 --> 01:20:47,551
<i>Hyung.</i>

1186
01:20:47,634 --> 01:20:51,638
You know how I rescued that little girl?
I met her <i>emo</i> today.

1187
01:20:52,138 --> 01:20:54,808
She's always home,
still too scared to go out.

1188
01:20:56,518 --> 01:20:58,186
The thing is, she did nothing wrong.

1189
01:20:58,937 --> 01:21:01,690
Kang Ki-jung sexually harmed children

1190
01:21:01,773 --> 01:21:04,651
while evading the police dragnet
for over four years.

1191
01:21:06,069 --> 01:21:07,404
He won't be easily caught.

1192
01:21:08,947 --> 01:21:10,115
I'm on your side.

1193
01:21:11,491 --> 01:21:13,535
But... you're still recovering.

1194
01:21:14,828 --> 01:21:16,121
You can't get hurt again.

1195
01:21:18,498 --> 01:21:19,833
Let the police handle it.

1196
01:21:26,506 --> 01:21:27,340
Hey, guys.

1197
01:21:28,300 --> 01:21:30,594
Shouldn't we still try to do
what we can to help out?

1198
01:21:31,094 --> 01:21:32,304
That's what I was thinking

1199
01:21:32,387 --> 01:21:34,389
the entire time
you were having that conversation.

1200
01:21:34,472 --> 01:21:35,307
Mmm.

1201
01:21:35,390 --> 01:21:37,434
Even the police are
struggling to track him down.

1202
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:39,519
Would we get in their way though?

1203
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:42,564
That's why we should help,
not hinder them.

1204
01:21:42,647 --> 01:21:45,108
Sometimes, it's ordinary people
who catch the criminals.

1205
01:21:45,191 --> 01:21:47,986
I saw a car while tailing Kang Ki-jung.

1206
01:21:48,069 --> 01:21:50,864
But the windows were so tinted
that I couldn't get a good look.

1207
01:21:50,947 --> 01:21:53,408
The fact I couldn't see inside
keeps bothering me.

1208
01:21:53,491 --> 01:21:55,493
What was the car's make and plate number?

1209
01:21:56,536 --> 01:21:59,205
Range Rover, 100-TA-5525.

1210
01:21:59,289 --> 01:22:00,498
"100-TA-5525."

1211
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:02,292
All right, I'll go ask my <i>hyung</i>.

1212
01:22:02,792 --> 01:22:03,668
Okay.

1213
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:06,880
I can go home next week,
so get me some equipment, guys.

1214
01:22:06,963 --> 01:22:08,340
Send a group text of what you need.

1215
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:09,925
Okay.

Plug this in,

1223
01:22:40,538 --> 01:22:42,082
and I can control it remotely.

1224
01:22:48,922 --> 01:22:50,590
Nice.

1225
01:22:51,424 --> 01:22:53,885
- I'll be able to do that. No problem.
- Can you let me up?

1226
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:55,553
- Oh, it's open.
- We'll make a great team.

1227
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:56,513
I'll talk to you soon.

FISH SAUCE

1229
01:23:11,361 --> 01:23:12,404
Is this fish sauce?

1230
01:23:13,154 --> 01:23:14,489
It'll be useful.

1231
01:23:16,157 --> 01:23:16,992
All right.

1232
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:22,747
Hey, hey. You're sure you can open it?

1233
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:23,957
YouTube had a tutorial.

1234
01:23:24,874 --> 01:23:26,042
- Okay.
- Mm.

1235
01:23:28,628 --> 01:23:29,796
- Oh shit!
- What the hell?

1236
01:23:29,879 --> 01:23:31,131
- What was that?
- What?

1237
01:23:31,214 --> 01:23:32,132
I don't know.

1238
01:23:33,633 --> 01:23:34,634
I'll try again.

1239
01:23:36,553 --> 01:23:38,763
- Ooh! Oh, oh.
- What's that sound? What's that?

1240
01:23:39,764 --> 01:23:41,433
Hey, we better leave.

1241
01:23:41,516 --> 01:23:42,684
Hurry up. Let's go.

1242
01:23:42,767 --> 01:23:45,311
What the hell?
What the fuck is my door doing?

1243
01:23:46,813 --> 01:23:47,856
Stop it.

1244
01:23:55,405 --> 01:23:56,281
Shit.

1245
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:14,966

Hey, I got it.

01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:27,437
MY LITTLE BRO

1249
01:24:33,526 --> 01:24:34,736
I see a shit ton of files.

Shit! What the hell's going on?

<i>This guy's computer has
a bunch of videos of kids that...</i>

1253
01:24:49,375 --> 01:24:50,543
Damn it.

1254
01:24:51,294 --> 01:24:52,170
Hey, guys.

1255
01:24:52,879 --> 01:24:56,216
This bastard has a terabyte
of child exploitation videos.

1256
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:00,678
Hand over the Taser.

1257
01:25:00,762 --> 01:25:02,430
- Now!
- Uh, here.

1258
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:05,308
Hey, J... Jung-do-ya.

1259
01:25:08,895 --> 01:25:10,897
You had Kang Ki-jung
make the video, didn't you?

1260
01:25:12,607 --> 01:25:13,608
Where is he?

1261
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:16,444
Use it.

1262
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:18,113
You don't think I will?

1263
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:19,823
Do it.

1264
01:25:20,615 --> 01:25:23,034
- Fucking bastard. Fucker!
- Jung-do-ya! Don't.

1265
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:23,993
- Let go.
- No way.

1266
01:25:24,077 --> 01:25:25,912
- Right now!
- You need to calm down, Jung-do-ya.

1267
01:25:26,996 --> 01:25:27,831
Don't do this.

1268
01:25:27,914 --> 01:25:28,873
- Let me go.
- Please stop.

1269
01:25:28,957 --> 01:25:30,125
- Let go!
- Calm down, please!

1270
01:25:36,756 --> 01:25:39,300
Shut up and calm down.

1271
01:25:44,305 --> 01:25:46,516
Dude, I can't believe
you actually used it.

1272
01:25:46,599 --> 01:25:49,394
I think blood's coming out
of his eye. What if he goes blind?

1273
01:25:49,477 --> 01:25:52,188
- I told you to hold back, dude.
- Oh man.

1274
01:25:54,023 --> 01:25:54,941
Just a sec.

1275
01:26:00,864 --> 01:26:02,991
Look at your eye.

1276
01:26:04,868 --> 01:26:07,912
You could go blind if you don't
go to the hospital right away.

1277
01:26:09,122 --> 01:26:12,458
Tell us where Kang Ki-jung is,
and I'll call you an ambulance.

1278
01:26:20,133 --> 01:26:21,968
Please nod if you're going to tell us.

1279
01:26:29,517 --> 01:26:30,476
Help me sit him up.

1280
01:26:40,361 --> 01:26:41,863
Now tell us.

1281
01:26:42,906 --> 01:26:44,365
I have...

1282
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:47,118
...a debit card
with a borrowed-name account I opened.

1283
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:48,536
Kang Ki-jung's using it.

1284
01:26:50,413 --> 01:26:54,667
On my phone, there are text messages
that tell you where he used the card.

1285
01:26:55,335 --> 01:26:56,711
About an hour ago...

1286
01:26:58,838 --> 01:27:00,048
another text popped up.

1287
01:27:00,131 --> 01:27:02,300
I bet you'll find him
if you go there.

1288
01:27:02,383 --> 01:27:03,426
CHINESE PAVILION

1289
01:27:03,509 --> 01:27:04,636
I told you everything, so...

1290
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:07,555
Ugh, just get me to the hospital <i>now!</i>

1291
01:27:11,017 --> 01:27:13,978
Is there another video Kang Ki-jung filmed
in the past four weeks?

1292
01:27:20,818 --> 01:27:21,736
Oh yeah!

1293
01:27:23,363 --> 01:27:24,197
There is?

1294
01:27:28,534 --> 01:27:30,161
Hey, calm down! Seriously!

1295
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:31,746
- Hey, stop.
- You piece of...

1296
01:27:31,829 --> 01:27:33,748
- Get off me.
- Don't do it! Stop!

1297
01:27:33,831 --> 01:27:34,666
Hey, hey!

1298
01:27:34,749 --> 01:27:36,251
- Stop!
- Calm down.

1299
01:27:39,045 --> 01:27:40,546
112. What's your emergency?

1300
01:27:40,630 --> 01:27:43,007
<i>A man's been making
pornographic videos of minors.</i>

1301
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:44,759
- <i>Could you come get him?</i>
- Where are you?

1302
01:27:45,677 --> 01:27:47,053
See all the red circles?

1303
01:27:47,136 --> 01:27:50,682
These are the places Kang Ki-jung used
Kim Min-wook's card in the past two weeks.

1304
01:27:50,765 --> 01:27:52,892
And each one is
surrounding this cluster of motels.

1305
01:27:52,976 --> 01:27:55,436
In my opinion,
he's probably in this area now.

1306
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:56,688
All right.

1307
01:27:56,771 --> 01:27:58,189
You brought your drone, right?

1308
01:27:58,273 --> 01:28:00,441
- Yeah, in the car.
- Okay.

1309
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:02,026
Listen up, guys.

1310
01:28:02,986 --> 01:28:03,861
Don't get hurt.

1311
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:06,364
Also,

1312
01:28:07,198 --> 01:28:08,283
sorry I got mad at you.

1313
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:11,869
Don't worry about it. We get it.

1314
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:13,830
Not gonna lie, I was scared.

1315
01:28:15,748 --> 01:28:16,582
Winner Winner...

1316
01:28:16,666 --> 01:28:17,959
Chicken Dinner!

1317
01:28:19,377 --> 01:28:20,878
Oh, it's cold.

1318
01:28:20,962 --> 01:28:21,796
Huh?

1319
01:28:24,841 --> 01:28:25,717
Where you headed?

1320
01:28:26,467 --> 01:28:27,510
Huh?

1321
01:28:28,469 --> 01:28:30,805
Not allowed. Nothing dangerous.

1322
01:28:32,432 --> 01:28:33,725
- <i>Appa...</i>
- Hey!

1323
01:28:34,934 --> 01:28:35,935
You were stabbed.

1324
01:28:37,145 --> 01:28:39,397
You could've died
if the knife had gone in any deeper!

1325
01:28:45,486 --> 01:28:47,071
Hey, guys, go inside for a sec.

1326
01:28:47,155 --> 01:28:48,573
- Huh?
- Oh, okay.

1327
01:28:48,656 --> 01:28:49,907
Uh, yeah, take your time.

1328
01:28:55,413 --> 01:28:56,539
Three months ago...

1329
01:28:58,541 --> 01:29:01,169
I'd never heard of
an electronic ankle tag, you know?

1330
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:05,214
But now I know it all.

1331
01:29:05,882 --> 01:29:07,091
Maybe <i>too</i> much.

1332
01:29:10,553 --> 01:29:12,347
I don't wanna forget what I've learned.

1333
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:13,848
Let the police handle it.

1334
01:29:14,682 --> 01:29:16,476
You don't need to be involved anymore.

1335
01:29:18,978 --> 01:29:19,812
You know,

1336
01:29:20,980 --> 01:29:23,358
that young girl I saved that day...

1337
01:29:26,486 --> 01:29:28,613
can't even leave the house
because she's terrified.

1338
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:33,242
She's only ten.

1339
01:29:34,660 --> 01:29:35,703
Ten years old.

1340
01:29:38,956 --> 01:29:42,460
She's too young and was so scarred
that she shut herself off from the world.

1341
01:29:44,295 --> 01:29:46,172
You know what else I found out today?

1342
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:51,803
That evil bastard hurt
another child after his release.

1343
01:29:56,641 --> 01:29:57,934
The police do their job.

1344
01:29:58,810 --> 01:30:00,812
I'm sure they're all working very hard.

1345
01:30:01,312 --> 01:30:03,147
I want to do everything in my power.

1346
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:08,277
No regrets.

1347
01:30:11,948 --> 01:30:14,826
I need to do the best
that I possibly can for that little girl.

1348
01:30:20,498 --> 01:30:22,375
So please, for God's sake, let me go.

1349
01:30:24,085 --> 01:30:26,212
I know I'll be able to catch that bastard.

1350
01:30:28,172 --> 01:30:29,048
Even as we speak,

1351
01:30:29,132 --> 01:30:31,342
another ten-year-old girl
could be out there,

1352
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:34,720
scared and shivering,
waiting for me to help out.

1353
01:30:37,265 --> 01:30:38,933
I wouldn't care if I didn't know.

1354
01:30:40,393 --> 01:30:42,812
But how can I do nothing
when I know everything?

1355
01:30:50,820 --> 01:30:53,448
I won't get hurt again,
so don't worry about it.

1356
01:30:57,702 --> 01:30:59,370
I'm confident I'll get him, <i>appa.</i>

1357
01:31:02,248 --> 01:31:03,499
Wish me luck, won't you?

1358
01:31:08,296 --> 01:31:09,297
See you later.

1359
01:31:11,507 --> 01:31:12,675
Let's go.

1360
01:31:12,758 --> 01:31:13,676
Okay.

1361
01:31:19,223 --> 01:31:20,391
Be careful, all right?

1362
01:31:21,726 --> 01:31:22,602
I will!

1363
01:32:11,776 --> 01:32:12,652
Ready.

1364
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:16,906
{\an8}VOICE CALL

1365
01:32:20,076 --> 01:32:21,452
I've started a group call.

1366
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:23,204
If anything happens,
let me know right away.

1367
01:32:23,287 --> 01:32:25,289
And do not step in. Got it?

1368
01:32:26,332 --> 01:32:27,166
Let's go.

1369
01:32:36,884 --> 01:32:38,970
Earthworm, you start from here
and go straight.

1370
01:32:39,053 --> 01:32:40,054
Got it.

1371
01:32:43,808 --> 01:32:44,809
Hello?

1372
01:32:45,768 --> 01:32:47,103
You go that way. I'll go this way.

1373
01:32:47,186 --> 01:32:48,271
- Okay, be careful.
- Yeah.

1374
01:32:52,817 --> 01:32:54,110
- Sorry to bother you.
- Yes?

1375
01:32:54,193 --> 01:32:57,280
Have you possibly seen this man
at your motel recently?

1376
01:32:57,363 --> 01:32:59,031
No, I've never seen him before.

1377
01:32:59,115 --> 01:33:00,866
Have you seen this man, by any chance?

1378
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:02,493
No, I've never seen him before.

1379
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:04,412
Excuse me, ma'am,
but have you seen this man?

1380
01:33:04,495 --> 01:33:05,830
I've never seen that man.

1381
01:33:05,913 --> 01:33:07,373
Could you please look again?

1382
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:08,416
I... don't know.

1383
01:33:09,041 --> 01:33:09,875
Thank you.

1384
01:33:09,959 --> 01:33:12,962
- He's definitely not one of our guests.
- Sorry to bother you. Thank you anyway.

1385
01:33:15,006 --> 01:33:17,300
<i>Hey, guys,
I'm in front of Daewon Inn right now.</i>

1386
01:33:17,383 --> 01:33:19,760
It's at the end of the alley
where we started.

1387
01:33:19,844 --> 01:33:22,054
There's Chinese takeout containers
piled up out front

1388
01:33:22,138 --> 01:33:24,390
and a bunch of men's shoes inside.
Come meet me here.

1389
01:33:24,473 --> 01:33:25,725
Okay.

1390
01:33:29,020 --> 01:33:30,062
Hey, over here.

1391
01:33:32,106 --> 01:33:33,524
- Over there.
- Where?

1392
01:33:42,867 --> 01:33:43,868
Hey.

1393
01:33:44,368 --> 01:33:46,454
I saved your life in jail.
Don't tell me you forgot.

1394
01:33:47,038 --> 01:33:48,539
I'm sick of hearing that.

1395
01:33:49,165 --> 01:33:51,334
How much longer
you gonna guilt trip us with that?

1396
01:33:52,168 --> 01:33:53,002
Ki-jung-a!

1397
01:33:53,085 --> 01:33:54,503
Let's open the window.

1398
01:33:54,587 --> 01:33:55,421
Yeah.

1399
01:33:59,550 --> 01:34:00,801
You guys go wait.

1400
01:34:01,302 --> 01:34:03,638
- I'll handle the rest.
- Be careful.

1401
01:34:04,263 --> 01:34:05,723
Call if you need backup.

1402
01:34:05,806 --> 01:34:07,224
- Good luck.
- You got this.

1403
01:34:14,523 --> 01:34:15,733
Hmm.

1404
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:28,788
Kang Ki-jung, you little shit. Come out!

1405
01:34:32,458 --> 01:34:35,086
- What's going on?
- Oh, I'm sorry about that.

1406
01:34:35,169 --> 01:34:37,672
- It's dangerous. Please go back in.
- Oh, okay.

1407
01:34:42,593 --> 01:34:44,178
Who are you, motherfucker?

1408
01:34:46,597 --> 01:34:48,849
I will crack your skull open,
you fucking prick.

1409
01:34:50,851 --> 01:34:53,270
That son of a bitch... Hey!

1410
01:35:05,491 --> 01:35:07,284
That dickhead. Why, you...

1411
01:35:07,368 --> 01:35:08,494
Fuck!

1412
01:35:09,495 --> 01:35:11,997
Ow, ow! He threw <i>gochujang!</i>
It's burning my eyes!

1413
01:35:12,081 --> 01:35:12,915
Fuck.

1414
01:35:14,417 --> 01:35:17,044
- Come here!
- You have a death wish or what?!

1415
01:35:26,679 --> 01:35:28,556
My hand!

1416
01:35:31,142 --> 01:35:32,601
Hey, asshole. Come here!

1417
01:35:39,567 --> 01:35:40,568
Oh!

1418
01:35:41,902 --> 01:35:44,155
Hey, you fucking piece of shit!

1419
01:35:50,494 --> 01:35:51,328
Huh?

1420
01:35:52,204 --> 01:35:53,289
Hmm!

1421
01:35:53,372 --> 01:35:54,206
What the hell?

1422
01:36:04,967 --> 01:36:05,801
Moisture!

1423
01:36:06,427 --> 01:36:07,553
I'll follow him.

1424
01:36:25,571 --> 01:36:28,115
- Hey, asshole, stay over there!
- Don't let him go inside!

1425
01:36:37,166 --> 01:36:38,918
Son of a...

1426
01:36:46,175 --> 01:36:47,593
Argh! It stings! It stings!

1427
01:36:51,847 --> 01:36:52,848
You little...

1428
01:37:01,273 --> 01:37:02,983
Fuck, not <i>gochujang</i>!

1429
01:37:04,735 --> 01:37:06,237
I'm saved. It's only <i>doenjang</i>.

1430
01:37:08,447 --> 01:37:09,573
Fuck off, you asshole.

1431
01:37:14,453 --> 01:37:15,746
Moisture, which way?

1432
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:16,831
To your right!

1433
01:37:17,790 --> 01:37:18,624
Okay.

1434
01:37:21,502 --> 01:37:23,003
<i>Make a left.</i>

1435
01:37:24,171 --> 01:37:25,297
<i>Now turn right.</i>

1436
01:37:31,595 --> 01:37:32,763
He spotted us.

1437
01:37:32,847 --> 01:37:34,390
Did he know we were following?

1438
01:37:34,932 --> 01:37:36,392
Yeah, I guess so.

1439
01:37:42,857 --> 01:37:44,400
He scared the shit out of me.

1440
01:38:02,293 --> 01:38:03,127
Ha!

1441
01:38:43,792 --> 01:38:45,461
Fuck.

1442
01:38:54,345 --> 01:38:55,220
Shit.

1443
01:39:00,142 --> 01:39:01,352
You're dead.

1444
01:39:07,524 --> 01:39:08,442
Die!

1445
01:39:18,953 --> 01:39:20,037
Bring it on. Come on!

1446
01:39:21,830 --> 01:39:23,040
Let's go, big guy.

1447
01:40:14,675 --> 01:40:16,385
How do we help him? Shit!

1448
01:40:21,515 --> 01:40:22,349
Hey!

1449
01:40:32,317 --> 01:40:33,902
- Oh, nice!
- Yeah!

1450
01:40:46,582 --> 01:40:47,583
Get up.

1451
01:41:03,599 --> 01:41:04,516
You little...

1452
01:42:23,804 --> 01:42:26,598
You have the right to remain silent.

1453
01:42:27,641 --> 01:42:29,059
Anything you say can...

1454
01:42:30,227 --> 01:42:32,855
can and will be used against you
in a court of law.

1455
01:42:34,314 --> 01:42:35,899
SILENT, AGAINST YOU, ATTORNEY

1456
01:42:36,483 --> 01:42:38,610
And you also have
the right to an attorney.

1457
01:42:52,624 --> 01:42:53,458
Wow.

1458
01:42:55,294 --> 01:42:57,421
"I present this award to you

1459

1463
01:43:07,014 --> 01:43:08,015

1464
01:43:08,098 --> 01:43:09,433
Thank you.

1465

You saved lives.

1466

You're a very brave man.

01:43:22,362 --> 01:43:24,156
Thank you very much.

1468
01:43:24,239 --> 01:43:25,365
It is now time

1469
01:43:25,449 --> 01:43:28,118
for the president to take pictures
with the award recipients.

1470
01:43:33,457 --> 01:43:34,708
You did good.

1471
01:43:44,927 --> 01:43:46,220
Oh, oh.

1472
01:43:46,803 --> 01:43:48,096

1476
01:43:56,772 --> 01:43:57,606
Are you okay?

1477

Yes, I'm okay now.
