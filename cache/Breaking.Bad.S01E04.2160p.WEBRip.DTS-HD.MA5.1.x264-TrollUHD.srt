1
00:00:02,192 --> 00:00:05,403
Operation Icebreaker.

2
00:00:07,947 --> 00:00:10,617
How we liking that?
We never used that before, did we?

3
00:00:10,783 --> 00:00:13,035
- Isn't that the name of a breath mint?
- What?

4
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:16,269
- Ice Breakers, right? Breath mint?
- Nobody's gonna think that.

5
00:00:16,414 --> 00:00:19,500
Gonna be thinking about some ship
in the North Pole breaking ice.

6
00:00:19,584 --> 00:00:22,420
Says you. I'm gonna be thinking
Operation Breath Mint.

7
00:00:22,587 --> 00:00:26,424
I think Operation Breath Mint every
time you and me are on a stakeout.

8
00:00:26,591 --> 00:00:29,219
Your breath can knock a buzzard
off a shit wagon.

9
00:00:29,385 --> 00:00:33,806
All right, Operation TBD.

10
00:00:33,973 --> 00:00:35,173
Thanks for nothing, Gom.

11
00:00:35,683 --> 00:00:39,687
Anyway, say hello to
Domingo Gallardo Molina.

12
00:00:39,854 --> 00:00:43,650
A.k.a. Krazy-8. Way smarter
than your average cheese eater.

13
00:00:43,816 --> 00:00:47,516
I turned him out when he was street,
but this dude's like <i>The Jeffersons</i>

14
00:00:47,612 --> 00:00:50,112
- moving on up.
- Every dealer he'd throw at us

15
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:54,244
- he'd end up snaking their customers.
- He's missing, presumed dead.

16
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:56,663
Found his car out in the boonies.

17
00:00:56,829 --> 00:01:00,959
Last guy he ratted out
was none other than his cousin

18
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:02,877
Emilio Koyama.

19
00:01:03,044 --> 00:01:05,544
You thinking the cousin found out
and took revenge?

20
00:01:05,672 --> 00:01:08,341
Could be, turns out he's missing too.

21
00:01:08,508 --> 00:01:11,886
And normally I'd say
someone did the world a favor.

22
00:01:12,053 --> 00:01:15,974
But our snitch's car, turns out
we find two grams of meth in it

23
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,240
we take it to the lab, they come back

24
00:01:18,351 --> 00:01:21,145
they tell us it is the purest
they've ever seen.

25
00:01:21,312 --> 00:01:22,981
Ninety-nine-point-one percent.

26
00:01:23,147 --> 00:01:25,797
Our chemist is blown away.
Said he couldn't do better.

27
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,945
Worse yet, it didn't come out
of some super lab in Mexico

28
00:01:29,112 --> 00:01:32,362
we're thinking this was cooked
here in the Land of Enchantment.

29
00:01:32,448 --> 00:01:35,952
Car was abandoned
at what appears to be a cook site.

30
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:38,621
This is the only other thing left behind.

31
00:01:38,788 --> 00:01:42,338
We're sending it off to Quantico,
see if they can pull something off it.

32
00:01:42,458 --> 00:01:47,505
Meantime, our guys swabbed the filter
element and found the same 99.1 meth.

33
00:01:48,923 --> 00:01:50,133
So be on notice.

34
00:01:51,217 --> 00:01:53,636
We got new players in town.

35
00:01:54,429 --> 00:01:57,974
Now, we don't know who they are,
or where they come from,

36
00:01:58,141 --> 00:02:00,602
but they possess
an extremely high skill set.

37
00:02:01,102 --> 00:02:02,979
<i>Me, personally</i>

38
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:07,400
<i>I'm thinking Albuquerque
just might have a new kingpin.</i>

39
00:02:42,143 --> 00:02:44,729
{\an8}Jesus, Walt,
you're burning the shit out of them.

40
00:02:45,396 --> 00:02:46,814
{\an8}Damn it.

41
00:02:47,023 --> 00:02:49,442
{\an8}Hey, Sky, you got any more chicken?

42
00:02:49,609 --> 00:02:51,611
{\an8}Emeril here is gonna need a fresh pack.

43
00:02:53,738 --> 00:02:55,073
All right, looking good.

44
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:57,950
Is this low-fat mayonnaise
in the coleslaw?

45
00:02:58,576 --> 00:03:01,245
{\an8}I don't know, it's store-bought.

46
00:03:01,454 --> 00:03:04,248
{\an8}Okay, Hank, you need another beer?

47
00:03:04,415 --> 00:03:06,000
{\an8}Does the pope shit in his hat?

48
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:10,004
{\an8}Yeah, I don't think that he does, Hank,
and I think everybody would like it

49
00:03:10,088 --> 00:03:11,538
{\an8}if you'd stop saying that.

50
00:03:11,673 --> 00:03:14,008
{\an8}- Marie, some more wine?
- I'm all right, thanks.

51
00:03:14,092 --> 00:03:15,927
{\an8}- All right.
- Hey, I want a beer.

52
00:03:16,094 --> 00:03:19,179
{\an8}Yeah, I want Shania Twain
to give me a tuggy.

53
00:03:19,347 --> 00:03:21,265
{\an8}Guess what. It ain't happening either.

54
00:03:21,432 --> 00:03:23,601
{\an8}- How about some more soda?
- Yeah, sure.

55
00:03:23,768 --> 00:03:25,770
{\an8}Honey, do you need anything?

56
00:03:25,937 --> 00:03:29,607
{\an8}- No, Walt, thank you.
- Okay. Be right back.

57
00:03:49,127 --> 00:03:51,963
{\an8}- No.
- What, are you kidding me?

58
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,382
{\an8}You look like a damn movie star, man.

59
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,135
{\an8}Girls gotta be lining up left and right.

60
00:03:57,635 --> 00:04:00,138
- Tell him how good-looking he is.
- He's adorable.

61
00:04:00,304 --> 00:04:03,154
He doesn't wanna be fricking adorable,
he wants to be hot.

62
00:04:03,307 --> 00:04:05,934
See what I'm talking about?
That's female perspective.

63
00:04:06,018 --> 00:04:10,022
{\an8}- She's supposed to say that.
- Look, a guy doesn't gotta look like

64
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:13,401
{\an8}you know, Charlton Heston...
I'm talking Moses days.

65
00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:17,196
- -to get a girl, all right?
- You just gotta have...

66
00:04:17,864 --> 00:04:19,657
...confidence.

67
00:04:19,824 --> 00:04:22,493
Confidence and persistence.

68
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,912
{\an8}Okay? That's what I'm talking about.

69
00:04:25,121 --> 00:04:27,665
{\an8}I chased your aunt Marie here
all over creation.

70
00:04:27,832 --> 00:04:30,543
I kept bugging her for a date,
she kept saying no.

71
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,410
{\an8}What, I asked you, like, 50 times?

72
00:04:32,545 --> 00:04:36,424
{\an8}Yeah, it was before they tightened
the stalking laws.

73
00:04:37,175 --> 00:04:41,429
{\an8}Anyway, how about your dad here?
That there's a good story, Walt.

74
00:04:41,637 --> 00:04:46,350
{\an8}- Tell him how you met Skyler.
- Mom was a waitress in Los Alamos,

75
00:04:46,517 --> 00:04:50,229
{\an8}and Dad said that thing to you.

76
00:04:50,396 --> 00:04:53,566
{\an8}Well, actually, your mother
wasn't a waitress

77
00:04:53,733 --> 00:04:57,945
{\an8}it was a summer job,
and she was the hostess,

78
00:04:58,154 --> 00:05:00,740
{\an8}and she also worked the cash register.

79
00:05:00,907 --> 00:05:04,619
{\an8}And I used to go in there a lot because
it was close enough to the lab

80
00:05:04,786 --> 00:05:07,663
{\an8}where I could ride my bicycle.

81
00:05:08,664 --> 00:05:10,374
And once I noticed her

82
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:15,922
it got to be so that I would only go in
when I knew she was working.

83
00:05:16,088 --> 00:05:19,217
When it was slow,
she would lean against the counter

84
00:05:19,717 --> 00:05:23,888
doing her crossword puzzles,
but kind of hiding it

85
00:05:24,055 --> 00:05:26,224
pretending that she was still working,

86
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,559
and once I caught on to that

87
00:05:28,726 --> 00:05:32,647
I would do crossword puzzles while
I ate my grilled-cheese sandwich.

88
00:05:32,814 --> 00:05:35,566
It got so that every day at lunch

89
00:05:35,733 --> 00:05:38,986
we would both be doing <i>The New</i>
<i>York Times</i> crossword puzzle

90
00:05:39,195 --> 00:05:41,781
10 feet from each other.

91
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:46,244
And eventually

92
00:05:46,744 --> 00:05:49,580
I caught her looking over at me,

93
00:05:50,748 --> 00:05:52,667
so I began saying:

94
00:05:52,834 --> 00:05:58,756
"Excuse me, 14 across,
seven-letter word for whatchamacallit

95
00:05:58,923 --> 00:06:02,426
may I ask what you wrote down?"

96
00:06:02,593 --> 00:06:06,764
And, well, that got us talking,

97
00:06:06,931 --> 00:06:11,310
and, boy, I tell you,
I was terrible at those puzzles.

98
00:06:11,727 --> 00:06:15,273
I don't think that I finished
even one of them.

99
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:18,609
But your mother would do them in ink.

100
00:06:18,776 --> 00:06:19,944
Very smooth.

101
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:23,947
I bet you didn't think
your old man had it in him, huh?

102
00:06:24,031 --> 00:06:27,201
But that's what I'm talking about,
that's persistence, you see?

103
00:06:27,367 --> 00:06:29,453
Once you set your cap for something,

104
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:33,165
or somebody, you gotta just, you know...

105
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:39,297
- Skyler.
- Mom, are you all right?

106
00:06:39,463 --> 00:06:41,632
Hey, hey.

107
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:43,634
Honey, it's okay.

108
00:06:43,801 --> 00:06:45,845
What's the matter?

109
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,808
What is it?

110
00:06:51,767 --> 00:06:53,895
Ask him.

111
00:07:03,487 --> 00:07:05,405
What's she talking about?

112
00:07:10,328 --> 00:07:11,537
Walt?

113
00:07:19,003 --> 00:07:21,339
I have cancer.

114
00:07:25,676 --> 00:07:27,178
Lung cancer.

115
00:07:37,188 --> 00:07:38,856
It's bad.

116
00:08:00,378 --> 00:08:02,213
<i>Ask him how long he's known.</i>

117
00:08:04,048 --> 00:08:07,593
- I guess a month, maybe.
- Oh, for God sakes, Walt.

118
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,179
We're just sitting out there having
a cookout like nothing's going on.

119
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,891
He made me promise not to tell anybody.

120
00:08:14,225 --> 00:08:17,728
Christ, these last 48 hours.

121
00:08:17,895 --> 00:08:22,400
And it's the weekend, so I couldn't
even get his doctor on the phone.

122
00:08:22,566 --> 00:08:25,569
Buddy, why...? I mean, why wouldn't
you wanna tell anybody?

123
00:08:25,736 --> 00:08:31,575
Walt, don't you see
everybody just wants to help you.

124
00:08:31,742 --> 00:08:35,830
We're family.
We get through these things together.

125
00:08:35,997 --> 00:08:40,584
And I don't get, you know, lung cancer?
How can that happen?

126
00:08:40,751 --> 00:08:43,337
- You don't even smoke.
- You know, I'm thinking

127
00:08:43,504 --> 00:08:45,504
that this goes back 20 years, maybe

128
00:08:45,631 --> 00:08:49,381
to the applications lab, all those
chemicals they had you working around.

129
00:08:49,468 --> 00:08:51,762
We always took the proper precautions.

130
00:08:51,929 --> 00:08:55,349
One time you complained that
they didn't give you the right kind of

131
00:08:55,433 --> 00:08:58,769
I don't know, some kind of
ventilation hood or something,

132
00:08:58,936 --> 00:09:01,772
- and then the headaches.
- Honey, it wasn't that.

133
00:09:01,939 --> 00:09:04,316
How do they think
they can get away with this?

134
00:09:04,483 --> 00:09:10,448
- We should hire a lawyer.
- Okay, so first let's deal with this.

135
00:09:10,614 --> 00:09:14,535
Okay, so, what's the next step for Walt?

136
00:09:14,702 --> 00:09:17,788
Certainly a second opinion, right?

137
00:09:17,955 --> 00:09:20,541
Right. Right, absolutely.

138
00:09:20,708 --> 00:09:25,129
Okay, so first thing tomorrow,
I talk to my radiologists

139
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:31,469
we find you the best,
the oncology dream team.

140
00:09:31,635 --> 00:09:34,638
That's good. That's good.

141
00:09:34,805 --> 00:09:36,432
Yeah.

142
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:39,643
Yeah?

143
00:09:40,644 --> 00:09:41,812
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay.

144
00:09:41,979 --> 00:09:43,355
Yeah.

145
00:09:48,986 --> 00:09:51,447
I'm gonna go check on Walt Jr.

146
00:09:52,323 --> 00:09:54,241
I'm gonna see

147
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,995
if I can talk him into,
I don't know, joining us.

148
00:09:58,245 --> 00:10:02,500
I really didn't mean for him
to find out that way.

149
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:10,382
Walt

150
00:10:11,717 --> 00:10:13,677
whatever happens

151
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:17,556
I hope this goes without saying,

152
00:10:17,723 --> 00:10:19,850
but whatever happens

153
00:10:20,684 --> 00:10:22,686
I want you to know that

154
00:10:24,188 --> 00:10:27,066
I'll always take care of your family.

155
00:10:54,718 --> 00:10:57,471
Yo, check out these fake Pop-Tarts.

156
00:10:57,638 --> 00:11:00,307
- These are mad tight, yo.
- No, thanks, man, pass.

157
00:11:00,516 --> 00:11:04,311
Your loss. These are from, like,
Canada, or something. Imported.

158
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,646
Hey, yo, what happened
to your hallway, man?

159
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:10,442
- Did, like, the ceiling fall down, or...?
- Oh, yeah

160
00:11:10,609 --> 00:11:13,946
no, man,
I think the house is just settling.

161
00:11:14,113 --> 00:11:16,323
You know,
it's been caving in left and right.

162
00:11:16,532 --> 00:11:18,284
Hit me in the eye.

163
00:11:18,742 --> 00:11:21,245
- It's bananas.
- Yo, my pops could fix you up

164
00:11:21,412 --> 00:11:23,747
he's, like, a contractor or something.

165
00:11:23,914 --> 00:11:26,292
Yeah? Yeah, right on,
I should grab that number.

166
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:29,128
Say, Jesse,
you still cook a little crystal?

167
00:11:33,424 --> 00:11:37,094
Could be, yeah.
You know, from time to time.

168
00:11:37,261 --> 00:11:40,097
I heard you lost your partner.

169
00:11:40,264 --> 00:11:41,557
Emilio.

170
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,351
Didn't he get locked up?

171
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,146
No, man, he's out.
His cousin bailed him out.

172
00:11:47,313 --> 00:11:49,273
I think he skipped town or something.

173
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,840
I don't know about any of that,
I've just been

174
00:11:51,942 --> 00:11:54,292
kind of doing my own thing
these days, so...

175
00:11:54,445 --> 00:11:56,989
But you maybe got some crystal, man?

176
00:11:57,156 --> 00:12:01,056
Because I could seriously go for a bowl
right now, you know, take the edge off.

177
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:05,372
- Hell, yeah, Sunday night bowl, yo.
- All right.

178
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,962
Well, maybe it just so happens

179
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:15,715
that I just recently cooked
the best batch ever.

180
00:12:17,218 --> 00:12:18,302
Yeah?

181
00:12:18,802 --> 00:12:21,055
Oh, yeah. Came up
with this whole new recipe.

182
00:12:21,222 --> 00:12:23,307
It's more like a formula.

183
00:12:23,474 --> 00:12:27,853
It's, like, way, way more chemically...

184
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,898
Shit, you know, it's just the bomb, so...

185
00:12:32,024 --> 00:12:35,194
But, you know, I don't know,
I've been thinking lately

186
00:12:35,361 --> 00:12:37,411
I'll just lay off of it for a while

187
00:12:37,529 --> 00:12:40,579
because lately it's been
kind of making me paranoid, so...

188
00:12:45,496 --> 00:12:48,666
You know, for, like,
health-wise, just lay off.

189
00:12:48,832 --> 00:12:53,254
Yo, if you're not into sharing, man,
just tell us to piss off, it's cool.

190
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,964
- We don't need no soap opera.
- Yeah, man, whatever.

191
00:12:56,048 --> 00:12:57,925
No, no, it's all good, you know.

192
00:12:58,133 --> 00:13:02,346
I'm just saying,
hey, I got plenty of pot.

193
00:13:02,513 --> 00:13:04,764
Yeah, I think I'll bounce, man.

194
00:13:04,932 --> 00:13:07,184
Yeah, sounds about right.

195
00:13:07,351 --> 00:13:11,689
Hey, yo, yo. Hey, homes, I'm joking.

196
00:13:11,855 --> 00:13:14,858
Okay, I'm totally joking with you.

197
00:13:15,025 --> 00:13:17,653
You kidding? Sit down.

198
00:13:24,243 --> 00:13:26,912
Best scante ever.

199
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:28,205
Grab that pipe.

200
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,546
Okay, there.

201
00:16:30,053 --> 00:16:31,889
Shit.

202
00:16:42,316 --> 00:16:45,819
Walt, do you need some help?

203
00:16:47,821 --> 00:16:53,452
Oh, no, I'm fine, honey. I'm fine.
Just privacy.

204
00:16:53,619 --> 00:16:55,329
Thanks.

205
00:16:57,414 --> 00:17:00,167
I'm right outside if you need me.

206
00:17:00,501 --> 00:17:02,085
Okay.

207
00:17:09,009 --> 00:17:11,159
Yeah, any time on Friday
is absolutely fine.

208
00:17:11,261 --> 00:17:14,097
Thank you so much for working us in.

209
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:19,186
Can I just put that on a credit card?

210
00:17:19,353 --> 00:17:21,438
Great. Perfect.

211
00:17:21,605 --> 00:17:26,693
Okay, so we will see you at 10:45
on Friday morning.

212
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:29,488
Thank you so much.

213
00:17:29,655 --> 00:17:31,281
Okay.

214
00:17:32,282 --> 00:17:35,202
Oh, yes.

215
00:17:35,369 --> 00:17:36,537
Honey

216
00:17:36,703 --> 00:17:40,457
the best oncologist, I mean,
not even just in New Mexico,

217
00:17:40,624 --> 00:17:43,710
but one of the top 10
in the entire nation

218
00:17:43,877 --> 00:17:47,172
his name is Dr. Delcavoli,

219
00:17:47,339 --> 00:17:49,508
and we see him on Friday.

220
00:17:52,302 --> 00:17:54,555
I mean, Marie really came through for us.

221
00:17:54,721 --> 00:17:56,807
She had her boss call, and...

222
00:17:59,476 --> 00:18:03,564
Okay, this is good.

223
00:18:04,231 --> 00:18:06,081
From here on out, things are gonna...

224
00:18:06,191 --> 00:18:08,569
What's that we're putting on
a credit card?

225
00:18:08,735 --> 00:18:11,905
It's just a deposit kind of thing.

226
00:18:12,364 --> 00:18:16,326
- How much of a deposit?
- It's $5000.

227
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,245
Five thousand?

228
00:18:21,123 --> 00:18:22,666
Jesus.

229
00:18:25,252 --> 00:18:27,504
What's that, just to start? I mean

230
00:18:27,671 --> 00:18:29,881
just to tell me what I already know?

231
00:18:30,048 --> 00:18:32,593
Walt, he's not in our HMO, okay?

232
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:35,637
So be it, we'll figure it out.

233
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:40,434
Come on, don't get hung up on money here.

234
00:18:40,642 --> 00:18:44,187
- We can always borrow from Hank.
- Absolutely not.

235
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,400
No, I just...

236
00:18:48,567 --> 00:18:50,444
We're not gonna do that.

237
00:18:51,153 --> 00:18:52,863
Well, maybe we can ask your mom.

238
00:18:55,407 --> 00:18:57,284
Have you even called her yet?

239
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:03,370
Walt, regardless, you're gonna have to
tell her about this

240
00:19:03,457 --> 00:19:06,607
- I mean, I'm willing to do it, but I...
- I'll call. I'll call.

241
00:19:06,918 --> 00:19:08,920
Okay, look

242
00:19:09,755 --> 00:19:13,550
I don't even want us
thinking about money.

243
00:19:13,717 --> 00:19:15,761
Money is not the issue here.

244
00:19:15,927 --> 00:19:18,597
- It's not.
- I know. I know.

245
00:19:21,141 --> 00:19:22,142
It's not.

246
00:19:22,309 --> 00:19:23,810
- Okay.
- Okay.

247
00:19:23,977 --> 00:19:25,646
Okay.

248
00:19:26,313 --> 00:19:28,815
I'll take care of the deposit.

249
00:19:28,982 --> 00:19:30,609
Yeah?

250
00:19:31,151 --> 00:19:32,694
Yeah.

251
00:19:34,655 --> 00:19:37,407
I'll borrow it from my pension.

252
00:20:08,105 --> 00:20:09,189
Damn it!

253
00:20:11,983 --> 00:20:15,487
Hey. Hey, pal, what's up?

254
00:20:18,031 --> 00:20:21,034
Oh, yeah, no, I thought I heard mice.

255
00:20:21,827 --> 00:20:24,371
Boy, that's all we need, huh?

256
00:20:26,206 --> 00:20:28,125
So, what's up, pal?

257
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,877
What the hell's wrong with you?

258
00:20:33,672 --> 00:20:38,009
- What?
- You're acting all...

259
00:20:38,176 --> 00:20:40,053
You're...

260
00:20:40,554 --> 00:20:45,976
You're all...
Why are you acting so weird?

261
00:20:46,143 --> 00:20:49,855
- Son.
- You're acting like nothing is going on.

262
00:21:43,074 --> 00:21:45,744
Oh, no, please. Please, please, no.

263
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,089
Hey, no, hey!

264
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:42,008
- Hey!
- Put that douche bag on the phone.

265
00:22:42,092 --> 00:22:43,176
Oh, come on.

266
00:22:43,342 --> 00:22:47,389
Hey, am I gonna have to
come down there and whup your ass?

267
00:23:00,652 --> 00:23:04,302
And let me tell you something else,
I'm not doing this for charity, right?

268
00:23:04,406 --> 00:23:06,783
I'm the best he's got.
He knows it, I know it

269
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:10,369
I expect to be paid to a level
commensurate with...

270
00:23:10,537 --> 00:23:13,498
I said, "Dave, do you think 40 grand
is a proper bonus?"

271
00:23:13,999 --> 00:23:16,849
That's less than 10 percent
of what I booked this quarter.

272
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,129
I'm not gonna sit here
and be disrespect...

273
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:21,464
Oh, he's shitting bricks.

274
00:23:21,631 --> 00:23:23,049
Oh, you know he is.

275
00:23:23,216 --> 00:23:25,716
Yeah, that man lives in fear
I'll go across town...

276
00:23:25,844 --> 00:23:27,220
Hell, I could go anywhere.

277
00:23:27,386 --> 00:23:29,388
Hoffman, Gordon Bradley, or Sorcher.

278
00:23:29,556 --> 00:23:33,476
Even Goldberg-Wayne. They'd make me
a partner for walking in the door

279
00:23:33,643 --> 00:23:36,093
- that's how ecstatic they'd be.
- Next customer.

280
00:23:36,187 --> 00:23:38,397
Hells, yes, brother man.

281
00:23:39,566 --> 00:23:41,735
Dude, you should check this chick out.

282
00:23:42,736 --> 00:23:44,571
Who? No.

283
00:23:44,738 --> 00:23:46,740
Buddy, she's a cow.

284
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,742
Stacey's a cow.

285
00:23:49,242 --> 00:23:51,912
We're talking major barnyard boo-hog.

286
00:23:52,078 --> 00:23:56,249
Roll her in flour and look for
the wet spot before you hit that, man.

287
00:23:56,458 --> 00:23:59,210
That kind of stink does not wash off.

288
00:23:59,377 --> 00:24:01,755
- Sir?
- Right.

289
00:24:01,963 --> 00:24:03,673
Sir.

290
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:05,675
Oh, yeah?

291
00:24:05,842 --> 00:24:07,928
- Sorry. Hi.
- Oh, totally.

292
00:24:08,094 --> 00:24:10,388
- Hi. What can I do for you today?
- Which dude?

293
00:24:10,472 --> 00:24:13,015
- That dude that looks like a lizard?
- Next in line.

294
00:24:13,099 --> 00:24:16,686
- And he limps like some leper.
- I'm sorry, I would like

295
00:24:16,853 --> 00:24:18,855
- a cashier's check...
- Grosses me out.

296
00:24:19,022 --> 00:24:20,273
...in the full amount...

297
00:24:20,439 --> 00:24:25,278
...made out to Oncology Partners
of New Mexico, please.

298
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:30,367
Oh, that's O-N-C-O-L-O-G-Y.

299
00:24:30,533 --> 00:24:32,451
Yeah, you got it.

300
00:24:34,453 --> 00:24:36,653
I don't understand
why they're forcing you

301
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:38,640
to choose between piccolo and oboe.

302
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,585
You show so much promise with both.

303
00:24:40,752 --> 00:24:43,129
They can't have any
switching between woodwinds.

304
00:24:43,296 --> 00:24:46,196
No matter how they divide it up,
someone would be left out.

305
00:24:46,299 --> 00:24:49,635
- Rules are rules, I guess.
- Sure, rules are rules. I'm all for that.

306
00:24:49,719 --> 00:24:52,931
But I'm telling you,
you really shine on that oboe.

307
00:24:53,098 --> 00:24:55,598
You have real talent,
and I'm not just saying that.

308
00:24:55,725 --> 00:24:57,435
Thanks.

309
00:24:57,811 --> 00:24:59,145
What about Mr. Pemberton?

310
00:24:59,312 --> 00:25:01,606
Is he giving you enough
individual attention?

311
00:25:01,773 --> 00:25:04,173
I'd say so.
He tries to talk to each one of us

312
00:25:04,275 --> 00:25:06,403
at least once during every practice.

313
00:25:06,569 --> 00:25:10,448
- That's good. Feedback's important.
- It's key, I think.

314
00:25:10,991 --> 00:25:13,952
Hey, so how was soccer practice?

315
00:25:17,496 --> 00:25:19,165
I think that was in our backyard.

316
00:25:28,091 --> 00:25:29,426
Who's there?

317
00:25:36,099 --> 00:25:38,517
What the hell are you doing out here?

318
00:25:41,646 --> 00:25:42,856
Hey, Dad.

319
00:25:44,357 --> 00:25:45,775
Hey, Mom.

320
00:25:46,276 --> 00:25:47,819
Jake.

321
00:25:47,986 --> 00:25:50,697
Got new patio furniture.

322
00:25:51,614 --> 00:25:53,491
Right on.

323
00:25:56,535 --> 00:25:58,204
My leg.

324
00:27:01,476 --> 00:27:03,602
What do you think it could be?

325
00:27:05,105 --> 00:27:07,357
God knows I'm no expert.

326
00:27:07,524 --> 00:27:11,194
I don't know. Uppers, downers?
Your guess is as good as mine.

327
00:27:11,361 --> 00:27:14,989
I think we should check his arms
for needle marks.

328
00:27:18,409 --> 00:27:19,536
Do we let him stay?

329
00:27:20,829 --> 00:27:23,873
The Presbyterian Church
has those meetings.

330
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,710
So maybe on condition, you know?
If he agrees to attend.

331
00:27:28,878 --> 00:27:31,673
I just don't know what to tell Jake.

332
00:27:39,389 --> 00:27:42,725
- Hey.
- Hey. Good evening.

333
00:27:43,351 --> 00:27:45,644
Well? Sleep well?

334
00:27:46,187 --> 00:27:49,232
What time's...? What time is dinner?

335
00:27:50,441 --> 00:27:52,861
In about an hour.

336
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:58,783
You know,
I could wash those clothes if you like.

337
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,952
They look a little lived in.

338
00:28:02,203 --> 00:28:05,707
No, that's cool. Maybe later.

339
00:28:10,295 --> 00:28:11,921
We are not doing this again.

340
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,923
No.

341
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:17,260
We said we'd lay down the law,
we lay down the law.

342
00:28:17,427 --> 00:28:20,388
We just have to be consistent about it.

343
00:29:06,142 --> 00:29:07,769
Hey.

344
00:29:08,728 --> 00:29:12,523
You're not taking the bus?

345
00:29:16,027 --> 00:29:18,154
All right. Well, listen.

346
00:29:18,655 --> 00:29:21,824
Give me maybe another 20 minutes,
and we'll get out of here.

347
00:29:21,991 --> 00:29:25,370
- All right.
- All right.

348
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,872
Yeah, good.

349
00:29:58,569 --> 00:30:02,198
You know, I just think that...

350
00:30:05,368 --> 00:30:08,830
things have a way
of working themselves out.

351
00:30:33,646 --> 00:30:35,773
When did you get this?

352
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,151
Last May at the year-end assembly.

353
00:30:38,318 --> 00:30:41,321
They gave me that one too.
The one on the end.

354
00:30:42,613 --> 00:30:46,200
Environmental Consciousness Award.

355
00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:50,204
What's that mean? What, you,
like, recycle cans and shit?

356
00:30:50,455 --> 00:30:52,305
I contacted <i>The Albuquerque Journal</i>,

357
00:30:52,415 --> 00:30:55,315
and asked what chemicals
they use to bleach their paper.

358
00:30:55,418 --> 00:30:58,518
- Wound up writing an article about it.
- Right on, little bro.

359
00:30:58,671 --> 00:31:01,549
Making mad inroads
with the business community.

360
00:31:01,716 --> 00:31:03,343
All right.

361
00:31:03,509 --> 00:31:05,303
Now, hey, remember

362
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:09,307
not all learning comes out of books.

363
00:31:12,935 --> 00:31:14,729
Look at you.

364
00:31:15,438 --> 00:31:17,982
You know, we should...
We should hang out more often.

365
00:31:18,066 --> 00:31:22,320
You know, just kick back and chill.

366
00:31:22,528 --> 00:31:27,575
I mean, if you ever, like,
I don't know, need advice.

367
00:31:28,034 --> 00:31:31,704
Because, you know, I've been...
I've been through it all. For real.

368
00:31:34,957 --> 00:31:38,586
Yeah, man, you... You play the flute?

369
00:31:39,379 --> 00:31:43,341
- It's a piccolo, actually.
- Dude, play some Jethro Tull.

370
00:31:46,552 --> 00:31:49,097
Hey, guys, how we doing in here?

371
00:31:49,972 --> 00:31:52,058
We're good.

372
00:31:53,601 --> 00:31:56,396
- Jake?
- Yeah. Fine, Mom.

373
00:31:56,562 --> 00:32:01,234
Well, that's good. That's great.

374
00:32:08,783 --> 00:32:12,578
You know, what the hell?
You see this?

375
00:32:13,246 --> 00:32:15,146
What am I, some criminal or something?

376
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,751
- Whatever.
- Whatever?

377
00:32:18,918 --> 00:32:21,254
What, you think that's okay?

378
00:32:21,421 --> 00:32:26,884
Like, "Oh, we can't let that scumbag
warp the mind of our favorite son."

379
00:32:27,051 --> 00:32:28,553
I'm the favorite?

380
00:32:29,762 --> 00:32:31,556
Yeah, right.

381
00:32:31,722 --> 00:32:33,933
You're practically
all they ever talk about.

382
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:14,408
Oh, snap.

383
00:34:15,493 --> 00:34:17,495
Awesome.

384
00:34:50,236 --> 00:34:52,780
- Yeah?
<i>- Yo, man, it's me.</i>

385
00:34:53,281 --> 00:34:56,742
Hey, listen. You know that product?

386
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:58,619
You got any more of that?

387
00:34:58,786 --> 00:35:00,936
No, man, okay?
I'm done giving out freebies.

388
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,416
You want charity,
go ask the Salvation Army.

389
00:35:03,583 --> 00:35:05,418
<i>No, no charity. No.</i>

390
00:35:05,585 --> 00:35:08,003
I got this cousin,
he's got him some rich friends.

391
00:35:08,087 --> 00:35:10,923
These dudes are in town,
they're looking to party.

392
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:14,594
And your stuff is, like, so sweet.

393
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,470
<i>So, what do you say?</i>

394
00:35:17,179 --> 00:35:19,098
You up for making some fat stacks?

395
00:35:19,265 --> 00:35:21,559
Because they'll buy everything you got.

396
00:35:31,611 --> 00:35:35,281
Yes. Yes. Okay.

397
00:35:40,953 --> 00:35:43,122
Oh, you can't be serious.

398
00:35:44,707 --> 00:35:46,357
What the hell are you doing here?

399
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:51,255
Yo, I waited till the ball buster left.
I mean, no offense.

400
00:35:52,965 --> 00:35:54,800
Who sent you, huh?

401
00:35:54,967 --> 00:35:56,552
- You wearing a wire?
- Hey. Jesus.

402
00:35:56,636 --> 00:35:58,262
- You setting me up?
- Homo.

403
00:35:58,763 --> 00:36:00,306
A wire? You want a wire?

404
00:36:00,473 --> 00:36:03,267
I got a wire.
Speak into the mike, bitch.

405
00:36:03,434 --> 00:36:04,984
What the hell's wrong with you?

406
00:36:05,144 --> 00:36:06,979
A wire.

407
00:36:07,146 --> 00:36:08,481
Jesus.

408
00:36:10,149 --> 00:36:13,149
- So who did you tell about...?
- Nobody. What, are you nuts?

409
00:36:13,277 --> 00:36:15,738
Then why are you here?

410
00:36:17,657 --> 00:36:19,367
I don't know.

411
00:36:19,533 --> 00:36:22,828
To, like, touch base.

412
00:36:23,371 --> 00:36:24,622
Touch base?

413
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:27,833
Yeah, you know.

414
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,671
What they call a debrief.

415
00:36:31,837 --> 00:36:33,547
Maybe we could, like...

416
00:36:33,756 --> 00:36:35,508
Thought we could debrief.

417
00:36:35,675 --> 00:36:37,551
Debrief?

418
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,553
Wow, that's...

419
00:36:39,762 --> 00:36:42,973
That's what you think we need, debrief?

420
00:36:45,017 --> 00:36:49,188
Yeah, after what happened,
it just seems like the thing to do.

421
00:36:49,355 --> 00:36:51,357
Kind of, you know, talk about it.

422
00:36:51,524 --> 00:36:54,402
I mean, we can't talk to anybody else.

423
00:36:55,861 --> 00:36:58,698
Anyway, that and I wanted to...

424
00:36:58,864 --> 00:37:00,032
Wanted to, you know

425
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:04,161
tell you how much everybody digs
that meth we cooked.

426
00:37:04,704 --> 00:37:08,374
Everybody digs the meth we cooked.

427
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:15,506
Seriously. I got dudes that would give
their left nut for a little more.

428
00:37:15,923 --> 00:37:18,884
- Great.
- I'm just saying, I mean, if you ever

429
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:21,762
you know, saw your way clear

430
00:37:21,929 --> 00:37:28,728
to, you know,
you and I cooking a little more...

431
00:37:36,819 --> 00:37:38,571
Get the hell off my property.

432
00:37:38,738 --> 00:37:41,574
- What? I'm just saying.
- Go. And don't come back.

433
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:43,743
Now.

434
00:37:45,745 --> 00:37:47,204
All right.

435
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,457
All right, you know what?

436
00:37:49,623 --> 00:37:51,709
Four grand.

437
00:37:52,585 --> 00:37:56,255
Your share from selling that batch.

438
00:37:56,756 --> 00:37:59,133
That's why I'm here.

439
00:37:59,467 --> 00:38:03,763
Yeah, yeah, that's right.
Hey, I didn't smoke it all.

440
00:38:27,536 --> 00:38:30,122
Non-small-cell adenocarcinoma.

441
00:38:30,331 --> 00:38:35,085
Stage 3A, which means it's spread
from the lung to the lymph nodes.

442
00:38:35,252 --> 00:38:37,755
There's no denying it's very serious.

443
00:38:38,339 --> 00:38:40,591
But it... Is it...?

444
00:38:41,133 --> 00:38:42,968
It is

445
00:38:43,761 --> 00:38:45,137
curable?

446
00:38:45,763 --> 00:38:48,224
I prefer the word "treatable."

447
00:38:48,641 --> 00:38:51,841
But the treatments we have
at our disposal can be very effective.

448
00:38:51,936 --> 00:38:55,397
Without making any promises,
I can tell you that the specific course

449
00:38:55,481 --> 00:38:59,568
of radiation and chemotherapy I'm
going to suggest has been successful.

450
00:38:59,735 --> 00:39:04,114
In certain cases, it's prolonged a
patient's life and resulted in remission.

451
00:39:05,991 --> 00:39:08,494
What about the side effects?

452
00:39:08,661 --> 00:39:12,164
Well, they can be mild
to practically non-existent.

453
00:39:12,373 --> 00:39:14,291
Or they can be pretty darn awful.

454
00:39:14,458 --> 00:39:18,128
It varies from patient to patient.
Typically, there's hair loss

455
00:39:18,295 --> 00:39:22,132
which begins a couple of weeks
after the start of chemotherapy.

456
00:39:22,675 --> 00:39:25,636
You may find yourself unusually
fatigued, not much energy.

457
00:39:25,803 --> 00:39:27,638
You won't want to get out of bed.

458
00:39:27,805 --> 00:39:31,851
You may lose weight due to reduced
appetite and certain intestinal issues.

459
00:39:32,017 --> 00:39:35,271
Muscle aches and pains,
gums will get sore and bleed.

460
00:39:35,437 --> 00:39:39,316
And, of course,
there's the possibility of nausea

461
00:39:39,483 --> 00:39:43,153
although we'll prescribe an
antiemetic and try to counteract that.

462
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,220
Possible kidney or bladder irritation.

463
00:39:45,322 --> 00:39:47,908
You may wind up with
increased bruising and bleeding.

464
00:39:47,992 --> 00:39:54,039
There are maybe sexual symptoms.
Your skin may become dry...

465
00:40:22,067 --> 00:40:24,236
Got anything to say?

466
00:40:30,910 --> 00:40:32,369
What do you know about that?

467
00:40:33,996 --> 00:40:36,665
- Nothing.
- Well, that's not gonna fly this time.

468
00:40:36,832 --> 00:40:39,585
How many chances have we given you?

469
00:40:39,752 --> 00:40:41,702
How many times have we sat right here,

470
00:40:41,837 --> 00:40:44,422
and had the same conversation
over and over again?

471
00:40:44,506 --> 00:40:47,092
Where you look us in the eye
and you plead ignorance?

472
00:40:47,176 --> 00:40:48,761
And you play on our emotions,

473
00:40:48,969 --> 00:40:52,264
and tell us anything and everything
you think we want to hear

474
00:40:52,348 --> 00:40:54,934
just so we'll give you another chance.

475
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:59,480
And it makes us feel like fools.
Every time.

476
00:41:03,484 --> 00:41:05,778
Enough, Jesse.

477
00:41:06,236 --> 00:41:07,279
Enough.

478
00:41:08,697 --> 00:41:11,408
We are not going to have this
in our house.

479
00:41:12,785 --> 00:41:15,371
We need you to leave.

480
00:41:54,743 --> 00:41:56,996
Thanks for not telling on me.

481
00:42:01,792 --> 00:42:04,169
You think I could have it back?

482
00:42:18,642 --> 00:42:21,103
It's skunk-weed anyway.

483
00:42:39,663 --> 00:42:42,163
<i>The Air Force is aware
of the widely held belief</i>

484
00:42:42,291 --> 00:42:44,841
<i>that some of these
could be flying saucers from...</i>

485
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,212
You know, this is actually very hopeful.

486
00:42:47,379 --> 00:42:49,179
<i>Nothing conclusive in the evidence,</i>

487
00:42:49,339 --> 00:42:52,133
<i>but probing and digesting
of information about UFOs</i>

488
00:42:52,217 --> 00:42:53,719
<i>continues unceasingly.</i>

489
00:42:54,344 --> 00:42:55,721
Did you hear me?

490
00:42:55,888 --> 00:42:59,391
I said this is really very, very hopeful.

491
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:03,395
<i>Defense Command in
Colorado Springs issued an order...</i>

492
00:43:03,562 --> 00:43:08,108
So can I call them
and tell them you'll start next week?

493
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,904
<i>Even as they did so,
the military wondered whether</i>

494
00:43:12,988 --> 00:43:15,638
<i>their scientific know-how
and their best weapons</i>

495
00:43:15,741 --> 00:43:22,581
<i>would be effective in any battle
of the Earth versus the flying saucers.</i>

496
00:43:23,123 --> 00:43:28,087
I just think that we need to discuss it
a little more, that's all.

497
00:43:28,253 --> 00:43:30,714
What is there to discuss?

498
00:43:30,881 --> 00:43:34,384
You're gonna get the best treatment,
and he's the best.

499
00:43:34,551 --> 00:43:40,182
Well, there's the money discussion.
I think... No, $90,000 out of pocket.

500
00:43:40,349 --> 00:43:42,226
- Maybe more.
- There's a way, Walt.

501
00:43:42,392 --> 00:43:43,727
There's financing

502
00:43:43,894 --> 00:43:48,190
there's installment plans.
I could always go back to work.

503
00:43:48,357 --> 00:43:51,860
- Walt, there's always a way.
- All right.

504
00:43:52,027 --> 00:43:55,030
Skyler, say that there is a way.

505
00:43:55,197 --> 00:43:58,283
And we spend all that money, and...

506
00:44:10,045 --> 00:44:14,383
Am I supposed to leave you
with all that debt?

507
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,302
No. Honey.

508
00:44:17,469 --> 00:44:21,098
I just don't want emotions ruling us.

509
00:44:21,807 --> 00:44:24,726
Maybe treatment isn't the way to go.

510
00:44:25,978 --> 00:44:29,314
Then why don't you just fucking die,
already?

511
00:44:32,484 --> 00:44:34,945
Just give up and die.

512
00:45:24,369 --> 00:45:26,872
Come on, move your ass.

513
00:45:28,248 --> 00:45:30,292
Name of the guy? You'll like him.

514
00:45:32,044 --> 00:45:35,547
Yeah, dude, I'm not worried.
I got the best fricking attorney.

515
00:45:35,713 --> 00:45:38,299
I would not want to be
on the other side of this one.

516
00:45:38,383 --> 00:45:42,554
He's got this little team of ninjas too
that go out and do covert operations...

517
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:44,890
He's got crap on people.

518
00:46:57,629 --> 00:46:59,047
What the hell?

519
00:47:03,427 --> 00:47:05,429
- What?
- Don't go near it, buddy.

520
00:47:05,595 --> 00:47:09,057
What...? What are you doing?
Call somebody. Call the fire people.

521
00:47:09,224 --> 00:47:10,976
Yeah. I have a fire...

522
00:47:11,143 --> 00:47:14,043
I don't believe this.
Do you know how much I paid for that?

523
00:47:18,984 --> 00:47:21,236
Why is it doing this?
