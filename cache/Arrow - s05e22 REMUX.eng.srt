1
00:00:02,295 --> 00:00:03,546
Previously on Arrow...

2
00:00:03,754 --> 00:00:06,048
Russia is your home. Let me go save mine.

3
00:00:06,257 --> 00:00:09,051
People are gonna wanna know
where I've been for the past five years.

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,180
It's easier if I'm just a simple castaway.

5
00:00:14,432 --> 00:00:16,350
I'm afraid you're going
to miss your boat home.

6
00:00:16,934 --> 00:00:18,936
What's so funny about my father's legacy?

7
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,105
He was going to disown you.

8
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:25,610
With help from the Green Arrow
and his team,

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,197
the Throwing Star Killer
is now behind bars,

10
00:00:29,405 --> 00:00:31,073
and our streets are a little safer.

11
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:37,538
Former District Attorney Adrian Chase
faces multiple counts of capital murder,

12
00:00:37,747 --> 00:00:38,748
among other charges.

13
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:42,460
SCPD spokesperson Alison Rou
credits the Green Arrow

14
00:00:42,668 --> 00:00:46,172
with bringing the man known as
the Throwing Star Killer to justice.

15
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:51,385
Well, it looks like the Green Arrow
is a hero again. Whoever he is.

16
00:00:51,594 --> 00:00:53,596
Yep. And the mayor
ain't doing too bad, either.

17
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:56,432
The Sentinel's got your approval rating
back up to 70%.

18
00:00:56,641 --> 00:00:59,018
What? Was it ever that high?

19
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:01,938
No, it was wasn't.
Um, anyway, listen, if you'll excuse me,

20
00:01:02,146 --> 00:01:04,649
I gotta go find Rene
and remove his head from his ass.

21
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:06,501
- Wait, what?
- He missed a hearing

22
00:01:06,525 --> 00:01:07,961
about possibly getting his daughter back.

23
00:01:07,985 --> 00:01:09,028
- Hey, Quentin?
- Yeah?

24
00:01:09,487 --> 00:01:11,465
If you need any help with that,
just let us know, okay?

25
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:13,074
Yeah, thanks. Yeah, will do.

26
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,534
Oh, by the way, um,
I'm sorry I almost forgot.

27
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,913
Happy birthday, Mr. Mayor.

28
00:01:19,205 --> 00:01:21,457
Thank you.

29
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:24,919
We should go get a drink tonight.

30
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:27,922
We haven't celebrated your birthday in...
I can't remember how long.

31
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,924
Remember the last time
we celebrated yours?

32
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:32,426
Oh, God, we decided
we would never talk about that again.

33
00:01:33,386 --> 00:01:34,845
Four years?

34
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:37,306
You've changed a lot, Speedy.

35
00:01:37,682 --> 00:01:41,519
We both have.
Just not sure I have for the better.

36
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:42,979
I'm sure.

37
00:01:43,396 --> 00:01:45,648
Look, Thea, uh,

38
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:48,150
being happy doesn't mean
you don't have issues.

39
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:50,987
It just means that you're working on them.

40
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:54,490
When did you become all Zen-like
and well-adjusted?

41
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,869
We should celebrate that tonight,
as well as your birthday.

42
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:00,955
I appreciate that,
but I already have plans.

43
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,374
With who?

44
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,669
Please say "not Susan Williams."

45
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:09,964
Um, it... No, uh, with Felicity.

46
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:12,675
As in a date?

47
00:02:12,883 --> 00:02:16,220
As, uh...
As in I don't know if it's a date.

48
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:17,972
But you're hoping that it is?

49
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,225
It's dinner.
People go to dinner.

50
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:26,856
See, I don't believe you,
but I find it incredibly cute.

51
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,091
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

52
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:58,095
Happy birthday. Everything hurt.
Everything hurts here.

53
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:05,728
Yes!

54
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,521
I love the cake,
where did you get it?

55
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,023
Lord Mesa Bakery.

56
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:10,313
What's up with number six?

57
00:03:10,441 --> 00:03:11,710
Is that for the number of members
of the team?

58
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:13,253
- It's cool.
- Actually, I ordered the cake

59
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:15,529
for a six-year-old because I wasn't sure

60
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:18,199
that I could order a Green Arrow cake
for a grown man.

61
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:21,629
Well, hey,
Oliver's a child at heart, right?

62
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:24,538
That is the concussion talking,
yep, for sure.

63
00:03:24,747 --> 00:03:26,187
I'm really sorry about that, Curtis.

64
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,750
No, that's okay. But you should know

65
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,878
that if I'd had my T-Spheres,
I would have...

66
00:03:31,087 --> 00:03:32,380
Would've what?

67
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:34,131
Would have still been on the floor.

68
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:36,926
I'm very sorry.

69
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,763
Mmm.

70
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:43,599
I was worried
this might've got hurt.

71
00:03:43,808 --> 00:03:44,809
What is it?

72
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:47,245
They are sound modulators
that I've been working on for Dinah.

73
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:50,648
Not only will they be able to
focus her canary cry,

74
00:03:50,815 --> 00:03:53,567
but they will be able to override
any kind of sonic dampeners.

75
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:55,152
- Yes.
- She's coming, right?

76
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:58,003
Yeah. She said if work didn't go too late,
then she'd swing on by.

77
00:03:58,447 --> 00:03:59,573
Thank you.

78
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:00,950
- Cake. Here you go.
- Yes!

79
00:04:04,161 --> 00:04:05,162
Lyla couldn't make it?

80
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:07,665
She and J.J. are visiting
her sister in Chicago.

81
00:04:07,832 --> 00:04:09,959
- Oh.
- We're good, man.

82
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:12,169
We'll patch things up.

83
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:18,967
I'm late, aren't I?

84
00:04:19,135 --> 00:04:20,886
That's all good. Didn't miss much.

85
00:04:21,137 --> 00:04:23,180
Just Oliver flipping Curtis
over his shoulder.

86
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:25,724
I told you a surprise party
wasn't a good idea.

87
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:28,144
How's Rene?

88
00:04:28,644 --> 00:04:29,687
He's not home.

89
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,623
There's a couple of days' worth
of newspapers

90
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:32,982
piled up outside his apartment.

91
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,192
- You're worried about him.
- Yeah, well, you know,

92
00:04:35,359 --> 00:04:37,736
Rene may come across
as an irresponsible idiot,

93
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:39,131
but that's... No, it's just 'cause

94
00:04:39,155 --> 00:04:40,715
that's what he wants
people to think of him, you know.

95
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:41,739
Yeah.

96
00:04:41,907 --> 00:04:43,367
- Hey.
- Hey.

97
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:45,887
We're gonna do a toast in
about five minutes. So, champagne, and...

98
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,496
- Club soda.
- All right, you got it.

99
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,415
Really nice wrapping.

100
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:50,708
Thank you.

101
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:55,588
Thank you all so much
for doing this. Cheers.

102
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:57,006
Cheers.

103
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,580
I almost forgot what it was like
to celebrate a birthday.

104
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:02,463
That's because we're usually

105
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:04,930
saving the city from being destroyed
this time of year.

106
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:08,058
Uh, it's like summer break for you guys.
What are you gonna do, huh?

107
00:05:08,434 --> 00:05:09,834
I've always wanted to see Florence.

108
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:13,063
The city in Italy,
not the woman or her weird machines.

109
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:16,901
I'm gonna teach J.J. how to fish.

110
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:20,338
Few days with my son on the water,
that'll be heaven.

111
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:21,922
I was thinking the Pacific Crest Trail.

112
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:25,576
For a night. For, you know,
just one night under the stars,

113
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:27,868
and then definitely
a manicure-pedicure afterwards.

114
00:05:28,704 --> 00:05:31,016
What about you, Oliver?
We know you got City Hall and all, but...

115
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,709
Yeah, it keeps me busy.
But I need to buy some socks.

116
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:38,464
Everybody has their thing.
I need socks bad.

117
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,299
Socks it is.

118
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:41,759
Hey, we all need socks.

119
00:05:42,218 --> 00:05:46,972
Uh, well, I think we could all use
another piece of cake, right?

120
00:05:48,224 --> 00:05:50,976
- Yeah, sure.
- You know, actually, I'm good.

121
00:05:51,227 --> 00:05:53,312
Had about three or four slices myself.

122
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:54,789
- You need cake, son.
- Oh, okay.

123
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,933
- You need to go.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, I need that, yeah.

124
00:05:57,274 --> 00:05:58,609
Oh.

125
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:00,319
That was subtle.

126
00:06:00,611 --> 00:06:02,071
So subtle.

127
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,991
I guess since the dinner
at Chez Marta was a ruse,

128
00:06:06,242 --> 00:06:08,118
they think we deserve some alone time.

129
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:09,453
Do we?

130
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,498
Well, I mean, I didn't know if it was a...

131
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:16,919
We can take it one step at a time.

132
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:19,004
I would like that very much.

133
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:20,798
This is hard for you, huh?

134
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,509
Hypothetically dating my ex-fiancée?
No. It's...

135
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,347
Wow, no, I meant summer vacation,
as they are now calling it.

136
00:06:28,681 --> 00:06:31,016
It's incredibly hard.
It's borderline impossible.

137
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:32,810
We won.

138
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:34,603
Oliver, we won.

139
00:06:36,272 --> 00:06:37,648
Just take a step back, you know.

140
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:40,085
You can put your feet up,
no matter the state of your socks.

141
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:44,154
You could just, God forbid, relax.

142
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:47,658
Yeah.

143
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:56,500
My government heard rumors of this place.

144
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:00,004
An island prison built by the Chinese.

145
00:07:01,005 --> 00:07:05,551
It's incredible that you should lead me
here of all places.

146
00:07:08,012 --> 00:07:09,638
I killed you.

147
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:12,474
Almost.

148
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,312
But nothing ever really dies.

149
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,148
There are always echoes.

150
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,985
You'll learn that soon enough.

151
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,405
The KGB call this the Red Death.

152
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:28,991
It's an interrogation drug

153
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:32,494
meant to break men
by inducing psychological anguish.

154
00:07:33,704 --> 00:07:36,832
It's why you followed me
halfway around the world?

155
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,250
Torture?

156
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:42,546
Murder creates intimacy between men.

157
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:45,549
So, I'd appreciate an honest answer.

158
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:49,678
If your intention was to return home,
why leave from here?

159
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:51,555
Honestly?

160
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:53,891
Go to hell.

161
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,893
That's an interesting response.

162
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:03,233
If my Chinese is correct,

163
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:05,474
this place is called purgatory.

164
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:09,865
You know the Catholics
consider purgatory to be

165
00:08:12,117 --> 00:08:14,453
the immediate state
following physical death?

166
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,257
Konstantin...

167
00:08:28,384 --> 00:08:31,887
When I kill you this time,

168
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:35,307
I'm gonna make sure you're dead.

169
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:44,608
When we're done, the only person you'll
want to kill is yourself.

170
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,905
I'm just saying, you could've taken
a big knife

171
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:52,884
and cut the tension between you two.
And by tension, I mean sexual tension.

172
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:54,410
Yeah, I know what you meant, Curtis.

173
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:58,288
And then the way you guys dressed up
for each other? Ooh! Sizzle! Sizzle!

174
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:01,166
Okay. Can you please stop?

175
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:03,137
You're worse than a shipper
on a soap opera.

176
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,421
Okay, well, look, I'm here.

177
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:07,923
I hope Dinah's still up,
I think her neighbors are asleep.

178
00:09:08,132 --> 00:09:10,012
That's the whole point
of this modulator anyway.

179
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:12,803
- Oh, no.
- "Oh, no" what?

180
00:09:13,846 --> 00:09:15,686
- I think she was robbed.
- Do you need backup?

181
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:18,851
Yeah, probably, but I'm here now,
so I gotta make sure she's okay.

182
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:29,778
Hello?

183
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,196
Dinah?

184
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:35,325
If there's someone in here,
you should know that I know martial arts.

185
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:36,618
Curtis, what's going on?

186
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:38,704
Oh, my God.

187
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:40,664
Curtis? Curtis?

188
00:09:41,623 --> 00:09:42,624
Curtis?

189
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:04,855
Clear.

190
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:07,357
We got Curtis' phone
but no Dinah and Curtis.

191
00:10:07,566 --> 00:10:09,693
Okay, well, if Curtis and Dinah
are missing,

192
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,213
I guess we can presume that Rene
didn't skip out on his daughter.

193
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,237
Whoever did this is good.

194
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:15,032
We know who's doing this.

195
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:16,658
It's Chase.

196
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:19,077
He's picking us off, one by one.

197
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:20,328
Not to state the obvious,

198
00:10:20,496 --> 00:10:24,374
but Chase is currently under surveillance
24/7 in an impenetrable glass box.

199
00:10:25,209 --> 00:10:26,644
There's no way
he got out to do this.

200
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:27,711
Look, he had to have help.

201
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:31,215
I hate to say this, but what if this was
Chase's plan all along?

202
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:32,861
Get himself caught, lull us to sleep.

203
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,150
Yeah. Well, consider me officially woke.

204
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,392
Okay, Chase has worked
with Evil Laurel before,

205
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:38,865
but she's currently locked up
atA.R.G.U.S.

206
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:41,289
and there is no way
that Evelyn is doing this all by herself.

207
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,392
John?

208
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:45,729
Isn't that League?

209
00:10:46,021 --> 00:10:47,439
It's Talia al Ghul.

210
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:52,879
Contact Thea and Lance,
we need to get them some place secure.

211
00:10:52,903 --> 00:10:54,881
There's an A.R.G.U.S. safe house
across town we can use.

212
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:57,105
Okay, you get them there
and then meet me at the bunker.

213
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,785
Where you going?

214
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:03,372
It's time to talk to Chase.

215
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,255
Where are they?

216
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:13,757
- Adrian, where are they?
- Who?

217
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:15,693
- You know damn...
- You know damn well who!

218
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,261
You're right. I do know.

219
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:20,889
Just like I know your every move,
while it seems like you know none of mine.

220
00:11:22,057 --> 00:11:23,100
Tell me where they are.

221
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:24,309
Or what?

222
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,880
We've already established
that you think you won't kill me.

223
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:28,397
Kind of weakens your leverage.

224
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:30,652
I'm gonna find them
and I'm gonna get them back.

225
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:35,289
Is that what you came here to tell me,
or are you just wasting time?

226
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:43,829
See you later.

227
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:49,793
Oh, pain. It's fascinating, isn't it?

228
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:55,090
Some men will do anything to avoid it,
others will embrace it.

229
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:56,967
Even revel in it.

230
00:11:57,426 --> 00:11:58,468
Like you.

231
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:02,639
That's why you're so formidable.

232
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:05,183
Pain is not a new experience to you.

233
00:12:05,684 --> 00:12:07,519
Then stop wasting my time.

234
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:17,487
That was my epiphany for true retribution.

235
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,698
I couldn't merely cause you pain.

236
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,533
I had to wake you up.

237
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,286
Open your eyes, make you see.

238
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,455
The pain you suffer is still with you.

239
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:29,875
This drug will help set it free.

240
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:44,139
Every cut, every bullet, every wound,

241
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:46,850
like you're feeling it all
for the first time.

242
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:56,360
Am I still wasting your time?

243
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:12,042
Freeze, jerk-wad!

244
00:13:13,043 --> 00:13:14,086
Sorry.

245
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:16,856
I knew it was you, but what if
it wasn't "you" you. You know?

246
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,440
Multiple Earths, evil twins, et cetera.

247
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,193
Et cetera being the scariest thing
I've said all day.

248
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:22,219
I hate this thing. Oh.

249
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:23,762
I'm a little on edge.

250
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,323
I'm actually really looking forward

251
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:27,224
to being holed up
in an A.R.G.U.S. safe house.

252
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:29,744
I don't want you in the safe house.
I want you down here with me.

253
00:13:29,768 --> 00:13:32,354
- What? No. Why?
- I can run comms remotely.

254
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:35,357
Okay? And if Malcolm Merlyn
has proven anything,

255
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,043
it's that when it comes to
the League of Assassins,

256
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,211
locks are more like suggestions.

257
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:41,613
I can handle Talia al Ghul
and whatever acolytes she's fighting with.

258
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:47,703
Where I need you is down here with me,
so that both of us can try to stop Chase.

259
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:49,413
Is this...

260
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,374
And this might sound
a little self-serving,

261
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:55,585
but is tactic the only thing
behind me staying down here?

262
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,963
- Honestly?
- Yeah.

263
00:13:58,755 --> 00:13:59,881
Of course not. Okay?

264
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:03,260
The thing that's clear, though,
to me right now is that I...

265
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:07,067
I let my guard down. And I shouldn't have.

266
00:14:07,097 --> 00:14:09,099
No one could have
seen this coming, Oliver. No one.

267
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:11,935
I saw it coming.
I knew something was wrong.

268
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:16,273
I knew it. Here. And I ignored it.

269
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:21,611
And then I second-guessed myself, and now,
everyone that I love is in danger.

270
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,280
Including, maybe...

271
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:26,849
- My son.
- No. I couldn't find him.

272
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:29,095
There's no way they're going to.
Not Chase. Not Talia al Ghul.

273
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,120
William's gonna be fine.

274
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:32,622
I appreciate that.
But you can't know that.

275
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:33,957
You can't.

276
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:37,002
William is the purest part of me.

277
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:39,337
And now he's in danger,

278
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:42,507
maybe because of something
that the worst part of me set in motion.

279
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:47,709
- How'd it go?
- Thea and Quentin are not happy about it,

280
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,139
but they're secure.

281
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:54,102
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no...
- What's going on?

282
00:14:54,311 --> 00:14:56,991
I had A.R.G.U.S. triple-check
on Black Siren, she's not in her cell.

283
00:14:57,147 --> 00:14:58,148
That's not a coincidence.

284
00:14:58,356 --> 00:14:59,596
Quentin doesn't know about her.

285
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,985
It's why Chase will send her right there.

286
00:15:02,194 --> 00:15:04,362
We need to get the safe house
on the phone now.

287
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:15,373
God, you know what the worst part
about a safe house is?

288
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:18,168
It's not being able
to use your cell phone. That's just...

289
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:19,377
That's barbaric.

290
00:15:19,628 --> 00:15:21,773
Well, yeah, normally I'd chalk that up
to millennial nonsense,

291
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:22,797
but I know what you mean.

292
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:26,384
I'm chomping at the bit to speak to
that judge on Rene's case right now.

293
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:27,803
Well, what could you say?

294
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:32,390
That Rene was kidnapped by some psycho
that's in jail? That...

295
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,851
I gotta do something, Thea.

296
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,537
I know what it's like to lose a daughter,

297
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,361
and hell if I'm gonna
let that happen to Rene.

298
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,480
Right.

299
00:15:41,024 --> 00:15:43,819
Agent Kosinski. Hello?

300
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:47,857
Hey, Sharon, we got a problem
with the comms in the...

301
00:15:49,866 --> 00:15:51,201
Stay here.

302
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:52,512
Yeah, well, I don't know about you,

303
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:54,336
but I'm sure as hell
not staying here waiting.

304
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:56,706
You read my mind. Let's go.

305
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,552
It's a tranq dart.

306
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,019
Stop right there!

307
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:21,731
Stop, turn around slowly. Turn...

308
00:16:31,908 --> 00:16:32,909
Hi, Daddy.

309
00:16:39,249 --> 00:16:40,417
No, it can't be.

310
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,752
It can be. Daddy, it can.

311
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:44,713
Don't worry.

312
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:47,047
I'll explain everything.

313
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,571
Just don't take your gun off her, Quentin.

314
00:16:51,595 --> 00:16:53,430
Thea, Thea...

315
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:55,557
You know it's not what it seems.

316
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:58,268
Okay, Ollie told...

317
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:11,239
I'm so sorry, Daddy.

318
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:21,291
What do we know?

319
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:25,295
You mean besides this being
the horror version of Groundhog Day?

320
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:27,631
Look, the security camera footage
is grainy,

321
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,259
but it's good enough to see Black Siren
giving her best Laurel impression.

322
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:33,828
We know there was
a second attacker. Who do we think it was?

323
00:17:34,012 --> 00:17:35,052
Well, the A.R.G.U.S. agent

324
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,974
that gave Black Siren
her "get out of jail free" card

325
00:17:38,183 --> 00:17:41,937
said that he was blackmailed by a woman
wearing black, so could be Talia...

326
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:43,145
It was Evelyn.

327
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:45,473
Agent Kosinski got a positive ID
before he got tranged.

328
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:47,484
So these kidnappings are what? Payback?

329
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:51,655
Before Chase tortured me,
I told him that the team was my strength.

330
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:52,983
He's trying to take it away.

331
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:55,134
So his lady friends can come after you
instead of him?

332
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:56,510
That doesn't sound very satisfying.

333
00:17:56,534 --> 00:17:59,263
Chase doesn't think I can game out
what he's planning, but it's obvious.

334
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:01,164
Yeah. Obvious to a murdering psychopath.

335
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,167
And present company excluded.

336
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:07,545
He's trying to leverage our friends
to make me set him free.

337
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:09,005
That's crazy.

338
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:11,841
Which would be consistent for Chase.

339
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:14,344
- You two have to leave the city.
- What?

340
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:16,489
You gotta leave the city.
You gotta leave the state.

341
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:17,657
And you can't tell me where you're going.

342
00:18:17,681 --> 00:18:19,450
Oliver, we're not leaving.
We're not going anywhere.

343
00:18:19,474 --> 00:18:20,474
We're not abandoning you.

344
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:22,286
I understand
that you're not abandoning me.

345
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:26,022
You're doing
what I'm asking you to do, because...

346
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:28,858
Chase knows how I think.

347
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:31,653
He knows that if he puts
the two of you in danger,

348
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:36,032
and he's gonna try to, that my instinct
will be to pull you close.

349
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:38,159
So do something he's not expecting.

350
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:39,911
Split up.

351
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:41,496
No, that's...

352
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:46,542
What about you?

353
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:49,796
If I don't have to worry
about the two of you,

354
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,924
then I can put my focus
towards finding the others.

355
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:54,860
You get this son of a bitch, Oliver.

356
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:55,969
I will.

357
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:07,939
You're strong.

358
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:09,899
Like a piece of iron.

359
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:13,945
You think you can resist any pain
because you have.

360
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:21,119
But the worst pain is up here.

361
00:19:22,412 --> 00:19:24,581
Locked away, deep inside.

362
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:28,293
That's what the drug is for.

363
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:31,421
To show you everything. Your sins.

364
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,179
Your failures.

365
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:40,764
I think you made your choice.

366
00:19:43,141 --> 00:19:44,351
No!

367
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:47,771
Your guilt.

368
00:19:48,605 --> 00:19:50,690
Oliver! No!

369
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:55,612
Your bloodlust.

370
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,121
Your inhumanity.

371
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:21,971
That gun, it only has one bullet.

372
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:25,016
You can waste it on me,

373
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:29,062
but I think we both know

374
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:32,148
who's responsible for your pain.

375
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:38,154
I've seen the strongest man

376
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:43,535
resist for up to 12 minutes
before ending his suffering.

377
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,246
Such is my respect for you that I...

378
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:49,332
I think you can last for, uh...

379
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:52,502
14 minutes.

380
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,383
Do svidanya.

381
00:20:59,676 --> 00:21:01,177
You're going to do it, aren't you?

382
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:07,517
Because you are not strong
and you know you deserve to die.

383
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:26,786
Let me help you understand.

384
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,289
I'm not going to Kill you.

385
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:32,417
I am never going to give you

386
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:36,796
the satisfaction of being the man
that you think I am.

387
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:40,425
You're never getting out of here.

388
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:42,552
Not today.

389
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,221
Not tomorrow. Not ever.

390
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,057
Do you understand?

391
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,893
No, I don't.

392
00:21:51,394 --> 00:21:52,729
But only because you're wrong.

393
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:59,736
I told you, Oliver. Everyone in your orbit
suffers as the price for your sins.

394
00:22:00,612 --> 00:22:05,158
And the only way to keep them
from paying that price is to let me go.

395
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:14,751
I'm gonna find another way.

396
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,671
Find it quick.

397
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:21,132
They're transferring me to Idaho tonight.

398
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:25,762
And once that happens,
this offer's off the table.

399
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:28,473
I don't want to see that happen, Oliver.

400
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:32,435
Like I told you,

401
00:22:32,602 --> 00:22:35,271
I think that you're one loss away
from getting destroyed.

402
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,441
Who would it be, I wonder?

403
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:42,445
Thea or Felicity?

404
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:46,157
Maybe someone else.

405
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,846
I mean, look. I don't understand,
all right? But that was Laurel.

406
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,791
No, Quent, it wasn't.

407
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:58,545
It looks like her and it sounds like her...

408
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:00,105
No, that was my baby girl, all right?

409
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:01,798
She's back. Just like with Sara.

410
00:23:01,965 --> 00:23:03,633
Listen, there...

411
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:09,180
It is hard to explain, but there are
these other Earths, okay?

412
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:10,557
Parallel universes.

413
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:12,517
You're talking crazy. Listen to yourself.

414
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:16,813
I know.
I know how crazy it sounds, trust me.

415
00:23:17,146 --> 00:23:18,147
But it is real.

416
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:20,692
It's real.

417
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:24,070
Just as real as meta-humans and aliens.

418
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:30,326
So, that wasn't Laurel?

419
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:33,204
It was a Laurel.

420
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:37,333
It's just not the one that we knew.

421
00:23:39,836 --> 00:23:42,839
Okay, now, look. She's very convincing.

422
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:44,953
And I need you to remember that,

423
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:47,343
because that is exactly why
Chase has brought her here.

424
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:52,682
Let's go.

425
00:23:53,516 --> 00:23:54,559
Where are we going?

426
00:23:55,852 --> 00:23:57,020
That's a surprise.

427
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:09,115
Felicity, I already have major anxiety.
You going silent on me is not helping.

428
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:11,125
You know,
my mom's really big into intuition.

429
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:14,621
Like, stars, signs, horoscopes,
Ouija boards, even.

430
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:16,890
I always thought it was
either stupid or ridiculous.

431
00:24:16,914 --> 00:24:18,458
Never really took it seriously.

432
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,751
Until now, right?

433
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:23,713
Yeah. I have this really bad feeling,
like right in the pit of my stomach.

434
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,048
What's it telling you?

435
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:27,442
We never should have left Oliver alone.

436
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:00,750
I agree with you, Felicity.

437
00:25:03,503 --> 00:25:04,587
Leaving Oliver feels wrong,

438
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:06,714
but maybe that's why
it was the right thing to do.

439
00:25:08,216 --> 00:25:09,902
You do realize
how backwards that sounds, right?

440
00:25:09,926 --> 00:25:12,404
I do realize that, but this is Chase
we're dealing with, remember?

441
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:15,723
Yeah. I know. But what if we overthought
it and now Oliver's vulnerable?

442
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:27,151
I see your sense of hospitality
remains intact.

443
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:29,362
You are not welcome here, Malcolm.

444
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:31,215
Do you aim to cut off
my other hand, Oliver?

445
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:32,407
Maybe.

446
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:34,796
You gonna tell another person
about my son?

447
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:37,537
Last time I was down here,
I saved your life.

448
00:25:37,745 --> 00:25:43,251
Do you really think that gives you a pass
for serving up William to Damien Darhk?

449
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:45,962
I'm sorry about that.
I wasn't thinking clearly.

450
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:48,506
I let my emotions get out of hand.

451
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:50,133
That is all in the past.

452
00:25:50,341 --> 00:25:52,802
The only thing I'm concerned about now
is saving my daughter.

453
00:25:58,099 --> 00:25:59,142
What's that?

454
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:06,852
Angry woman with two swords.

455
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:08,877
You getting major Isabel Rochev
flashbacks right now?

456
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,821
- Yep.
- You remember how we handled that, right?

457
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:12,113
Yep.

458
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,801
We gotta get out of here.

459
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,887
That worked better with Rochev.

460
00:26:37,472 --> 00:26:38,514
Digg.

461
00:26:41,476 --> 00:26:42,810
Told you I had a bad feeling.

462
00:26:58,659 --> 00:27:01,120
John? Felicity?

463
00:27:01,579 --> 00:27:02,872
They're gone, Oliver.

464
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:06,125
- Damn it!
- They were taken alive. Focus!

465
00:27:07,502 --> 00:27:10,379
I would've thought you would have tagged
your, your pets by now.

466
00:27:10,588 --> 00:27:15,468
They're my friends, Malcolm, and Curtis
did put tracking nanites in Felicity,

467
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:19,347
but they were rendered useless
when Chase set off an EMP.

468
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:23,726
Well, I'll give him this much.
He's 50 moves ahead.

469
00:27:24,977 --> 00:27:26,297
But the question is, to what end?

470
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:29,273
He wants to leverage me
into breaking him out of prison.

471
00:27:30,358 --> 00:27:35,112
And my daughter?
Your sister isn't sufficient leverage?

472
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,573
You've blackmailed people, Malcolm.

473
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:40,241
How often have you kept up
your end of the bargain?

474
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:43,371
And quite frankly, I am surprised

475
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:47,124
that someone like you is willing
to give in to a man like Chase.

476
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,544
I will give in to someone
if it gets Thea back.

477
00:27:50,837 --> 00:27:54,215
The fact that she hates me
doesn't make her any less my daughter.

478
00:27:55,383 --> 00:27:57,260
Something you learned last year,

479
00:27:57,468 --> 00:28:00,054
friends are one thing,
but family is family.

480
00:28:00,555 --> 00:28:02,223
And your child?

481
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:07,019
You would do anything,
absolutely anything, to keep him safe.

482
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:10,481
A little while ago, I worried that John...

483
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:13,526
That the personal connections that I had
were making me vulnerable.

484
00:28:13,734 --> 00:28:16,320
Because as long as there are people
in my life that I care for,

485
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:20,074
I have to be something else
to protect them.

486
00:28:20,283 --> 00:28:22,243
That's something
that I can't leave in the past.

487
00:28:23,411 --> 00:28:25,746
I admire you, Oliver.

488
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:29,250
It takes a special kind of idiot
to actually get dumber with time.

489
00:28:29,876 --> 00:28:31,586
I am not in the mood, Malcolm.

490
00:28:33,004 --> 00:28:35,089
Human connections are what keep us human.

491
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:39,635
And it's sad that
it's a sociopath

492
00:28:39,844 --> 00:28:41,524
who's gonna have to point this out to you.

493
00:28:41,762 --> 00:28:44,307
You can't live on an island.
You've already tried.

494
00:28:46,017 --> 00:28:48,853
But you are always gonna
have people in your life, Oliver.

495
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:53,441
And they will always need you.
Better or worse, baggage and all.

496
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:56,319
And if you can't accept that,

497
00:28:56,527 --> 00:28:59,238
well, your past is gonna stay your anchor.

498
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:03,868
- Yeah?
- Mr. Queen,

499
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:05,345
the marshals are here
to transfer the prisoner.

500
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:06,787
You said you wanted to know.

501
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:08,497
Thank you, I'm on my way.

502
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:13,127
I'm going to ensure that
Chase's prison transfer goes smoothly.

503
00:29:13,336 --> 00:29:15,421
We're very capable people,

504
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:18,299
and we're gonna find a way
to rescue everyone.

505
00:29:26,641 --> 00:29:27,641
You're not real.

506
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:29,727
I am as real as your conscience.

507
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:35,650
Remember? Survive.

508
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,819
My dying wish for you
after I gave my life for yours.

509
00:29:40,154 --> 00:29:42,573
But you squandered my sacrifice,

510
00:29:42,782 --> 00:29:47,328
and now my daughter,
my dear Shado, is dead.

511
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:53,501
Yao Fei, I'm so sorry. I'm so...

512
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:55,503
Apologies won't bring her back.

513
00:29:56,045 --> 00:29:57,672
And it won't bring the others back.

514
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,965
Please, stop.

515
00:29:59,173 --> 00:30:02,593
Taiana, Akio, Sara...

516
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:05,846
Everyone you've lost
over the past five years.

517
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:09,809
And all of those you have yet to lose.

518
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:12,186
This isn't real.

519
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:14,480
It's not real, you're in my head.

520
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:19,110
And who better
than you knows the truth?

521
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:22,405
What truth?

522
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:28,119
That those closest to you
are fated to suffer for your sins.

523
00:30:32,707 --> 00:30:34,542
But you can save them, Oliver.

524
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:39,880
By making the same sacrifice

525
00:30:40,089 --> 00:30:41,298
I made for you.

526
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:47,430
I love what you've done
with the place.

527
00:30:47,638 --> 00:30:50,099
You got shipping containers
as nice as this on Earth-2?

528
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:53,477
Everything's exactly the same
as it is here, Dad.

529
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:57,356
Don't call me that.

530
00:30:57,565 --> 00:30:59,165
You're Laurel, but you're not my Laurel.

531
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:03,029
- Is that too tight?
- You care?

532
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,031
You think this isn't hard for me?

533
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07,783
Doesn't much look like it.

534
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:10,703
I owe my freedom to Adrian Chase.

535
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:14,540
In exchange, I give him my help

536
00:31:14,749 --> 00:31:17,043
and his assurance that you won't get hurt.

537
00:31:17,293 --> 00:31:18,961
Chase's assurance?

538
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:22,923
My Laurel wouldn't be that stupid.

539
00:31:23,257 --> 00:31:24,550
I know.

540
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:28,637
You loved her, and I know you lost her,

541
00:31:29,764 --> 00:31:32,683
and I know how
it makes you feel seeing me.

542
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:34,977
You've got no idea.

543
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:50,743
Don't worry, sir. If custody's threatened,
we have orders to shoot on sight.

544
00:31:54,497 --> 00:31:55,498
Tick-tock.

545
00:31:59,293 --> 00:32:01,670
You're not pulling my strings
anymore, Adrian.

546
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:04,256
At least you admit that I have been.

547
00:32:06,008 --> 00:32:08,928
Hey, but just so that we're clear,

548
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:11,889
the moment I get on that transfer chopper,

549
00:32:12,098 --> 00:32:14,934
my friends have orders to kill yours.

550
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,353
We'll see about that.

551
00:32:28,364 --> 00:32:30,241
Think you're about to get a phone call.

552
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:52,680
Hello?

553
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:54,430
Hello?

554
00:32:54,598 --> 00:32:56,725
Somebody help me.

555
00:32:57,268 --> 00:32:58,561
Please help me.

556
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:01,730
Please, please.

557
00:33:26,589 --> 00:33:27,589
I need the van!

558
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:29,049
Sir, what are you doing? Stop!

559
00:33:42,104 --> 00:33:43,355
He took your son, didn't he?

560
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:45,649
How'd you know?

561
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:48,068
Like minds. Here.

562
00:34:05,794 --> 00:34:07,213
Something funny, nut-bag?

563
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:09,882
Not yet, but soon.

564
00:34:13,928 --> 00:34:15,012
See what I mean?

565
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:36,837
This would be easier
if we could kill them.

566
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:38,327
Then it's not gonna be easy.

567
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:43,249
We're compromised.
Take the prisoner out!

568
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:46,918
They're targeting Chase.

569
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:48,295
Go, I'll cover you.

570
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:50,172
Really!

571
00:35:08,023 --> 00:35:09,149
Chase!

572
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:11,105
Thanks for the assist, pal.

573
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:12,486
Where is my son?

574
00:35:12,695 --> 00:35:14,175
No! No! That wasn't the deal, Oliver.

575
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:16,043
That wasn't the deal.
I said you let me go,

576
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:17,533
and I keep your loved ones safe.

577
00:35:18,033 --> 00:35:19,201
But I'm not gone yet.

578
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:31,046
Why did you involve William?

579
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:34,300
That's my boy.

580
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:37,886
He's an innocent.

581
00:35:38,304 --> 00:35:42,391
So was my wife, man, but you involved her.

582
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:47,313
I already told you, Oliver,
everyone that you care about suffers.

583
00:35:49,523 --> 00:35:50,733
Everyone.

584
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,072
I'll see you on the boat.

585
00:36:17,092 --> 00:36:21,096
Okay, Chase's helicopter flew to an
abandoned airfield in Dawn Valley, Utah.

586
00:36:21,347 --> 00:36:23,908
Then five minutes later,
this aircraft took off from the same field

587
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:26,060
at a vector of two-seven-zero.

588
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:28,604
Due west.
That would take him back to Star City.

589
00:36:28,771 --> 00:36:30,105
Chase seems smarter than that.

590
00:36:30,356 --> 00:36:33,525
I'm trying to track this plane,
but it's not easy without Felicity.

591
00:36:33,734 --> 00:36:36,195
Back before the Undertaking,
some of my associates,

592
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:39,281
especially those who were
on the wrong end of your bow,

593
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,367
thought that The Hood had computer skills.

594
00:36:41,617 --> 00:36:44,453
I had good hardware
and a specific purpose.

595
00:36:45,287 --> 00:36:47,057
Chase turned off the transponder
on the plane.

596
00:36:47,081 --> 00:36:49,458
Luckily, Felicity has access
to a keyhole satellite

597
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:53,128
that can track the heat signature
of any aircraft in the world. Which...

598
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:54,712
Impressive.

599
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,632
Just got lucky.

600
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:58,926
- You expecting someone?
- Yes, I am.

601
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:00,278
Because Chase is working with

602
00:37:00,302 --> 00:37:02,304
at least Black Siren, Evelyn Sharp,

603
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:05,432
Talia al Ghul, and whatever army
she's currently controlling.

604
00:37:05,641 --> 00:37:07,309
So you called in reinforcements?

605
00:37:07,476 --> 00:37:10,771
If I wasn't such a confident individual,
my ego might be bruised.

606
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:14,149
Malcolm, your ego is what I'm going to
need you to keep in check.

607
00:37:14,483 --> 00:37:15,651
Why?

608
00:37:15,901 --> 00:37:17,444
Who did you reach out to?

609
00:37:21,949 --> 00:37:22,991
Husband.

610
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:30,249
Mr. Merlyn.
I assume you still have no title.

611
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:32,334
- No.
- Malcolm...

612
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:34,837
- I1 will not work with her.
- I told you.

613
00:37:35,003 --> 00:37:36,463
I'd sooner slice her throat.

614
00:37:36,672 --> 00:37:37,965
Try to, you mean.

615
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:41,173
Malcolm, you said you were willing to do
whatever it takes to get Thea back.

616
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:44,847
So, here we are!

617
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:46,682
Fine.

618
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:48,976
But does she know?

619
00:37:53,856 --> 00:37:55,149
Know what, Mr. Merlyn?

620
00:37:55,357 --> 00:37:57,526
One of the people we are up against.

621
00:37:58,527 --> 00:37:59,528
IS your sister.

622
00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:04,324
Nyssa, I wanted to explain it
to you in person.

623
00:38:06,869 --> 00:38:08,620
We have Chase at C-one-thirty.

624
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:12,624
Flew out over the coast
banked southerly 12 degrees, which...

625
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:14,042
Which means...

626
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:15,377
What does it mean?

627
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:23,250
I know where he's taking them.

628
00:38:31,018 --> 00:38:33,187
Why would your adversary
bring them here?

629
00:38:34,146 --> 00:38:36,815
For that matter,
how did he even know about this place?

630
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:38,400
Talia.

631
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:40,569
She researched me.

632
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:42,404
Probably told Chase everything.

633
00:38:42,696 --> 00:38:43,739
Ironic.

634
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:48,076
When I was a little girl,
my father told me to visit this place.

635
00:38:51,914 --> 00:38:53,415
It's where I found Sara.

636
00:39:02,508 --> 00:39:04,259
Please, don't.

637
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:11,016
I'm sorry that I have to.

638
00:39:12,434 --> 00:39:14,228
But it's better for everyone.

639
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:25,781
This is the only way
to make sure that...

640
00:39:28,075 --> 00:39:31,286
That I don't infect everyone that I love.

641
00:39:31,912 --> 00:39:33,622
But we love you in return for it, Ollie.

642
00:39:36,458 --> 00:39:37,793
We need you home.

643
00:39:38,669 --> 00:39:40,462
Please come home to me, Ollie.

644
00:39:40,963 --> 00:39:43,298
To Thea, and your mother.

645
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:46,969
Please, we need you.

646
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:53,016
If you don't, then your father
and my sister will have died for nothing.

647
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:26,008
- Diggle! Felicity!
- We're okay, you okay?

648
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:28,152
We're fine.
Little north of pissed off, though.

649
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:30,178
- Rene, Dinah, where are they?
- Not with us.

650
00:40:32,848 --> 00:40:34,182
Relax.

651
00:40:35,517 --> 00:40:38,478
Enjoy the weather.

652
00:40:40,689 --> 00:40:41,732
Miss Smoak.

653
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:45,694
Anybody ever tell you
how much you suck at life?

654
00:40:46,862 --> 00:40:48,030
No.

655
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:49,197
Care to be the first?

656
00:40:49,406 --> 00:40:50,657
Why are we here?

657
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,577
So you recognize this place?

658
00:40:55,537 --> 00:40:56,913
That's good.

659
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:03,045
Oliver's gonna come for us.

660
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:05,213
Yeah, I'm counting on it, sis.

661
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:09,551
Sounds like Chase is using us as bait.
He wants to draw Oliver out.

662
00:41:09,843 --> 00:41:11,553
Numbers aren't exactly in his favor.

663
00:41:11,762 --> 00:41:12,846
He faced worse odds before.

664
00:41:13,055 --> 00:41:14,056
Yeah.

665
00:41:14,598 --> 00:41:15,798
With the help of you and John.

666
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:18,101
Roy and Laurel. Thea.

667
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:19,393
The rest of us.

668
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:21,281
Curtis is right,
Oliver can't do this alone.

669
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:41,416
I need your help.

670
00:41:43,043 --> 00:41:44,878
Hey, kid.

671
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,260
I'm glad you came back.

672
00:42:25,127 --> 00:42:26,128
