my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

5
00:00:12,115 --> 00:00:15,717
<i>I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.</i>

6
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:17,686
<i>I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,</i>

7
00:00:17,688 --> 00:00:21,256
<i>but in doing so, I opened
up our world to new threats.</i>

<i>And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.</i>

No!

12
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:33,294
The man who saved Central City.

13
00:00:33,296 --> 00:00:34,729
Why did you want to kill me?

14
00:00:34,731 --> 00:00:36,898
- He promised he'd take me home.
- Who?

15
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,401
- Zoom.
- Wells killed my mother.

16
00:00:39,403 --> 00:00:40,702
I don't know anything anymore,

17
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:42,370
especially who I can and can't trust.

18

S.T.A.R. Labs is now safer than ever.

19

People can't just waltz in and out of here.

20
00:00:46,143 --> 00:00:48,043
- Exactly.
- [gasps]

21
00:00:48,045 --> 00:00:51,112
- Stay where you are.
- My name is Jay Garrick.

22
00:00:51,214 --> 00:00:53,681
Your world is in danger, Barry Allen.

23
00:00:54,785 --> 00:00:56,484
Please, just let me explain.

24
00:00:56,486 --> 00:00:58,153
I mean you no harm.

25
00:00:58,155 --> 00:00:59,420
How do you know my name?

26
00:00:59,422 --> 00:01:01,823
I know all your names. Caitlin Snow,

27
00:01:01,825 --> 00:01:03,925
Cisco Ramon, Detective Joe West...

28
00:01:03,927 --> 00:01:05,627
Enough.

29
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:07,562
That part about explaining
needs to happen right about now.

30
00:01:07,564 --> 00:01:09,330
This world is in danger.

31
00:01:09,332 --> 00:01:11,499
What other worlds are there?

32
00:01:11,501 --> 00:01:13,668
When you created the
singularity above Central City,

33
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,038
you also created a breach
between my world and yours.

34
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,873
I'm sorry, a breach?

35
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:21,242
Yes, a portal connecting our two earths.

36
00:01:21,244 --> 00:01:23,678
And what precisely is your concern?

37
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,549
A few days ago, you found a dead man
named Al Rothstein at the nuclear plant.

38
00:01:27,951 --> 00:01:29,417
But then a different Al
Rothstein tried to kill you.

39
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:31,139
Atom Smasher.

40
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:32,473
That man was from my world.

41
00:01:32,475 --> 00:01:33,875
If he got through the breach,

42
00:01:33,877 --> 00:01:35,443
I suspect there'll be more to follow.

43
00:01:35,445 --> 00:01:38,649
Okay, so, Jay, how exactly
do you know all of this?

44
00:01:41,651 --> 00:01:44,886
Where I came from, I
was a speedster like you.

45
00:01:44,888 --> 00:01:47,388
They called<i> me</i> The Flash.

I've heard that name before.

00:02:05,065 --> 00:02:08,834
Atom Smasher, he said Zoom
sent him here to kill me.

Who is this guy?

54

He's a speedster, like you and me.

56

Why haven't you come to see us before?

79
00:03:10,063 --> 00:03:11,896
I'm in a foreign world here, Detective.

80
00:03:11,898 --> 00:03:13,397
I didn't know who you all were.

81
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:15,833
Took me that long to piece it all together.

you, another Flash,

it all came as an
unexpected shock to me, too.

I could do to convince you.

<i>[dramatic music]</i>

101
00:04:11,824 --> 00:04:14,125
So, Mr. Garrick,

102
00:04:14,127 --> 00:04:16,594
how long have you been
The Flash on your world?

103
00:04:16,596 --> 00:04:19,330
Not long enough to call me Mister.

104
00:04:19,332 --> 00:04:20,564
Please, it's Jay.

105
00:04:20,566 --> 00:04:21,866
Jay, of course.

106
00:04:21,868 --> 00:04:24,635
On my world, I've been The
Flash for about two years.

107
00:04:24,637 --> 00:04:27,038
And how did you get your speed?

108
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,106
Not really sure. I was at my lab

109
00:04:29,108 --> 00:04:32,076
trying to purify heavy water
without any residual radiation

110
00:04:32,078 --> 00:04:33,911
when there was a blinding light.

111
00:04:33,913 --> 00:04:36,314
I fell into a coma. When I woke up,

112
00:04:36,316 --> 00:04:39,016
I could run almost as
fast as the speed of light.

113
00:04:39,018 --> 00:04:41,719
Sorry. Did you say lab?

114
00:04:41,721 --> 00:04:43,421
Are you a scientist?

115
00:04:43,423 --> 00:04:44,955
Well, I certainly didn't
work at a place like this,

116
00:04:44,957 --> 00:04:46,257
but, yeah.

117
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,759
I had a respectable solo operation.

118
00:04:48,761 --> 00:04:50,895
Part-time chemist, part-time physicist.

119
00:04:50,897 --> 00:04:52,997
- Part-time superhero.
- Hmm.

120
00:04:52,999 --> 00:04:56,967
I can forget that superhero
part now, though, huh?

121
00:04:56,969 --> 00:04:58,436
Is any of this possible?

122
00:04:58,438 --> 00:05:00,338
A breach to another earth? It's not, right?

123
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,605
The contrary. Just recently,

124
00:05:01,607 --> 00:05:04,308
the many-different-worlds
theory proposed interaction

125
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,310
with parallel universes was plausible.

126
00:05:06,312 --> 00:05:08,312
Now, if what Mr. Garrick's saying is true,

127
00:05:08,314 --> 00:05:10,581
that theory's been proven
sooner than we all thought.

128
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:11,749
It doesn't add up.

129
00:05:11,751 --> 00:05:13,017
I'm gonna be honest here,

130
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:14,285
I don't understand what the hell

131
00:05:14,287 --> 00:05:15,753
any of you are talking about.

132
00:05:15,755 --> 00:05:18,055
So, Jay is saying he's from,

133
00:05:18,057 --> 00:05:20,257
like, a mirror-world.

134
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:22,159
Or a parallel universe

135
00:05:22,161 --> 00:05:24,528
that's very, very similar to ours.

136
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:27,965
Multiverse would be a more apt description.

137
00:05:27,967 --> 00:05:30,701
- No, not helping.
- Bless your heart.

138
00:05:30,703 --> 00:05:33,371
Okay, let's see if this helps.

139
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:38,275
This is our earth.

140
00:05:38,277 --> 00:05:42,113
Let's call it Earth-1.

141
00:05:42,115 --> 00:05:45,118
And this second Earth,
let's call it Earth-2.

142
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,987
This is where Jay claims to be from.

143
00:05:49,989 --> 00:05:53,325
And these other earths, three, four, five,

144
00:05:54,227 --> 00:05:57,896
to infinity, all of them,
are nearly identical to ours.

145
00:05:58,498 --> 00:06:01,399
And they all exist at the same time,

146
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:04,702
giving us endless alternatives
to what we have here.

147
00:06:04,704 --> 00:06:09,006
For example, the Joe West on
Earth-2, your doppelganger,

148
00:06:09,008 --> 00:06:10,408
he might not be a detective.

149
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,043
He could be a Nobel
Prize-winning physicist.

150
00:06:13,045 --> 00:06:16,614
And you, the Barry Allen here is The Flash,

151
00:06:16,616 --> 00:06:20,117
but over there, he could be an electrician.

152
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:23,989
So, I'm assuming that the
people on all these other earths

153
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:27,324
work to make money to pay bills and such.

154
00:06:27,326 --> 00:06:29,326
- I would imagine.
- So we got that in common.

155
00:06:29,328 --> 00:06:30,728
I'm heading back to the station.

156
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,463
Call me when this makes
a little bit more sense.

157
00:06:32,465 --> 00:06:33,831
I'm still trying to wrap my head

158
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:34,965
around this whole idea of time travel.

159
00:06:34,967 --> 00:06:36,567
[laughs softly]

160
00:06:38,671 --> 00:06:41,105
There is, uh, one problem that remains.

161
00:06:41,107 --> 00:06:43,507
If Mr. Garrick is telling the truth,

162
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:44,942
there is a breach

163
00:06:44,944 --> 00:06:46,844
somewhere in Central
City that we need to find

164
00:06:46,846 --> 00:06:48,612
and close for good.

165
00:06:48,614 --> 00:06:49,914
Yeah, but how do we find it?

166
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,382
We don't even know what to look for.

167
00:06:51,384 --> 00:06:53,250
Well, I... I suggest we
put our heads together

168
00:06:53,252 --> 00:06:56,287
and come up with a solution.

169

Those days are over.

171
00:07:06,299 --> 00:07:09,667
- What'd you find?
- Well, Jay's heart rate is extraordinarily low.

172
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:12,603
And he does have regenerative capabilities.

173
00:07:12,605 --> 00:07:14,271
Other than that, I'm
not seeing any evidence

174
00:07:14,273 --> 00:07:15,973
of the Speed Force in his system.

175
00:07:15,975 --> 00:07:17,608
We don't even have proof
that he's a speedster,

176
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,143
much less from another earth?

177
00:07:19,145 --> 00:07:20,678
Not necessarily.

178
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,812
What does that mean?

179
00:07:21,814 --> 00:07:23,647
Well, Jay doesn't know this,

180
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:25,082
but while I was testing his heart rate,

181
00:07:25,084 --> 00:07:26,884
blood pressure, and motor responses,

182
00:07:26,886 --> 00:07:30,721
I also measured his autonomic
reactions while we were talking.

183
00:07:30,723 --> 00:07:33,224
You gave him a lie detector test?

184
00:07:33,226 --> 00:07:35,626
And he passed it.

185
00:07:38,097 --> 00:07:39,897
What if he's not a good guy,

186
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:41,799
and he just wants to find our weaknesses?

187
00:07:41,801 --> 00:07:45,002
Keep running tests. See
what else you can find out.

there may be positions

194

available on your
anti-meta-human task force.

195
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:09,593
Yeah, everybody quit. There
is no task force anymore.

196
00:08:09,595 --> 00:08:13,063
Well, I know someone who's
interested in being on it.

197
00:08:13,065 --> 00:08:14,732
Me.

198
00:08:14,734 --> 00:08:15,900
You do realize that

199
00:08:15,902 --> 00:08:17,434
meta-humans have super powers, right?

200
00:08:17,436 --> 00:08:19,069
- [laughs softly]
- And even if they didn't,

201

you wouldn't be a good fit for the team.

I didn't mean to imply that.

204

Good, because I know how
difficult this job would be,

205

206

Detective Thawne, yes.

214

- Spivot, Patty Spivot.

219
00:08:54,707 --> 00:08:56,941
Yes, Spivot, the answer's no.

220
00:08:56,943 --> 00:08:58,876
All I'm asking for is a shot, sir.

- Please, just an interview.
- You just had the interview.

You're doing what you think you have to.

But you'll all realize
soon enough that this,

the tests, it's unnecessary.

You're not the first person
that's said that to me.

If what you told me about Zoom is true,

232
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,173
that he sent Rothstein here to kill you,

instead of locking me up in here,

you better start listening.

It was nice to meet you, Barry.

325
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:08,370
Yeah, you too. Ahem.

326
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,613
His blood pressure is
low, his heart rate is low,

327
00:13:18,615 --> 00:13:21,183
his oxygen levels are impressive.

328
00:13:21,185 --> 00:13:23,785
Yeah, but nothing compared to Barry's.

329
00:13:23,787 --> 00:13:27,189
No, but he's certainly in
the physical specimen range.

330
00:13:27,191 --> 00:13:30,258
- In more ways than one.
- Hmm?

331
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,894
Oh, I wasn't paying attention.

332
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,730
That's enough for today, Jay.

333
00:13:34,732 --> 00:13:36,364
Thank you.

334
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:39,968
Found it at the crime scene.

335
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,704
I mean, it's gotta be from the
meta-human that attacked me.

336
00:13:42,706 --> 00:13:44,272
Huh.

337
00:13:44,274 --> 00:13:45,407
What is this stuff? Sand?

338
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:47,008
- [sighs]
- It's not sand.

339
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:49,144
It's human cells whose myosin II protein

340
00:13:49,146 --> 00:13:51,146
have migrated to the cell's periphery.

341
00:13:51,148 --> 00:13:53,248
Jay's a fellow science nerd.

342
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,418
Those cells have the ability
to rearrange and harden,

343
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,487
giving them the appearance of sand.

344
00:13:58,489 --> 00:14:00,388
And how do you know this?

345
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,790
They belong to a meta-human

346
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:03,058
I've fought before named Sand Demon.

347
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,359
I know you're new here,

348
00:14:04,361 --> 00:14:05,794
so I'm just gonna break it down for you.

349
00:14:05,796 --> 00:14:07,362
The whole "naming the bad guys thing,"

350
00:14:07,364 --> 00:14:09,531
that's my jam. But you know what?

351
00:14:09,533 --> 00:14:10,665
I'm gonna let you have that one

352
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:11,733
'cause I actually kinda like it.

353
00:14:11,735 --> 00:14:12,734
I'm not mad at that one.

354
00:14:12,736 --> 00:14:14,102
Is that Barry's sweatshirt?

355
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:16,605
Oh, uh, sorry. It was
all we could find, so...

356
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:19,074
I was gonna say, 'cause
it looks a lot smaller

357
00:14:19,076 --> 00:14:23,145
on you, right? [Chuckles]

358
00:14:23,847 --> 00:14:26,548
I gotta do this thing.

359
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,084
So, who is this Sand Demon?

360
00:14:29,086 --> 00:14:30,385
I don't know his name,

361
00:14:30,387 --> 00:14:31,853
but I know how to stop him.

362
00:14:31,855 --> 00:14:33,155
You know what?

363
00:14:33,157 --> 00:14:34,923
I think we'll be fine on our own.

364
00:14:34,925 --> 00:14:37,359
Look, Barry, I don't
know what else I can do

365
00:14:37,361 --> 00:14:39,294
to prove to you I'm on your side.

366
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:40,695
I've been poked, prodded.

367
00:14:40,697 --> 00:14:43,799
I even subjected myself
to a full body scan.

368
00:14:43,801 --> 00:14:45,133
I was being thorough.

369
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:46,802
Sand Demon's from my world.

370
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:49,271
Let me teach you how to stop him.

371
00:14:49,273 --> 00:14:52,407
Yeah, I don't need you
to teach me anything, Jay.

372
00:14:52,409 --> 00:14:54,509
Zoom sent Rothstein here to kill you.

373
00:14:54,511 --> 00:14:56,611
He must have sent Sand Demon
here to do the same thing.

374
00:14:56,613 --> 00:14:58,446
Don't you get it? Anyone
close to the Flash,

375
00:14:58,448 --> 00:15:00,282
all of you, are in a lot of danger.

376
00:15:00,284 --> 00:15:01,983
All right.

377
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:03,919
If you're so good,

378
00:15:03,921 --> 00:15:05,887
you would have caught him already.

Hey, beautiful mind,

384
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:23,271
I think you need to take a breather.

385
00:15:23,273 --> 00:15:25,674
After some, uh, lengthy calculations,

386
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:27,475
I believe I have discovered the key

387
00:15:27,477 --> 00:15:30,312
to proving the proposed breach theory.

388
00:15:30,314 --> 00:15:33,114
Exotic matter.

389
00:15:33,116 --> 00:15:34,516
Huh.

390
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:35,684
You mean, like,

391
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:36,918
transdimensional energy?

392
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,120
Precisely. Exotic matter,

393
00:15:39,122 --> 00:15:42,224
transdimensional energy
will theoretically leak

394
00:15:42,226 --> 00:15:44,659
from one universe into another.

395
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:46,828
Now, if this breach Mr.
Garrick's talking about

396
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,763
is real, if there is indeed

397
00:15:48,765 --> 00:15:53,268
a hole in our universe
which leads to his earth...

398
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,970
We can make some adjustments

399
00:15:54,972 --> 00:15:57,305
and upload an electrophotography program

400
00:15:57,307 --> 00:15:58,707
to the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite

401
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:00,876
and essentially photograph

402
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:02,344
the exotic matter leak.

403
00:16:02,346 --> 00:16:05,647
Thereby giving us the
locale of said breach.

404
00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:08,049
Last time I saw the kit, it
was in the fabrication room.

It was a cash business.

One night he went to Fairfield bank
