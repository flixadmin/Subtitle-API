52
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:15,589
You remember in the camp --

53
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:20,218
you were so hungry
you'd cry all the time

54
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:24,765
and I snuck into the storage room
to steal you rice?

55
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:30,979
I took care of you.

56
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:37,402
I still will.

57
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:46,661
I also remember the time
they came after you for stealing.

58
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:51,374
I said no, it was me,
and they broke my hands.

59
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:54,711
You might be my big sister.

60
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:58,423
But I protect you too.
We protect each other.

61
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:01,885
You know...

62
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:04,805
the Americans will torture me.

63
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:07,516
I won't let them.

64
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,102
How will you stop them?

65
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,651
You have to let me go.

66
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,572
I won't attack anyone.

67
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,658
I won't hurt anyone.

68
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:30,080
I'm your brother --

69
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:34,835
we only have each other now.

70
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:37,712
Please.

71
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:54,855
I'm sorry.



717
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:33,077
Please. Don't.

720
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:09,196
Please.

721
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:13,451
I love you.

722
00:49:15,453 --> 00:49:17,037
I love you, too.
