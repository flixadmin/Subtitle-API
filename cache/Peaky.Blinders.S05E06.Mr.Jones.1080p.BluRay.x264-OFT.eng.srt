1
00:00:01,005 --> 00:00:03,205
There are some things we need to discuss.

2
00:00:03,325 --> 00:00:07,165
Our friend Jimmy McCavern
has asked for control of the racecourses

3
00:00:07,285 --> 00:00:08,485
north of Wincanton.

4
00:00:08,605 --> 00:00:10,045
I said yes.

5
00:00:10,165 --> 00:00:13,085
- In return for what?
- No return.

6
00:00:15,525 --> 00:00:16,645
None.

7
00:00:17,925 --> 00:00:21,605
I'm glad I didn't shoot you.

8
00:00:21,725 --> 00:00:23,805
It would have been a kindness.

9
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,845
Now get out.

10
00:00:27,965 --> 00:00:29,405
This is a cheque guarantee.

11
00:00:29,525 --> 00:00:31,365
Signed by Mosley.

12
00:00:32,605 --> 00:00:35,685
On behalf of a man called Jimmy McCavern.

13
00:00:46,565 --> 00:00:48,485
<i>The consequence of good intentions.</i>

14
00:00:49,565 --> 00:00:51,085
<i>My good intentions.</i>

15
00:00:53,205 --> 00:00:54,605
Push the button.

16
00:00:54,725 --> 00:00:56,925
Unlock the door and come home to me.

17
00:01:01,925 --> 00:01:03,485
I have a job for you.

18
00:01:05,725 --> 00:01:07,485
I'll come for you...

19
00:01:07,605 --> 00:01:09,405
...after midnight on Wednesday.

20
00:01:09,525 --> 00:01:10,965
Barney Thomason...

21
00:01:12,245 --> 00:01:15,685
...is gonna kill Oswald Mosley.

22
00:01:15,805 --> 00:01:17,525
While he's on stage.

23
00:01:17,645 --> 00:01:19,165
While I'm stood next to him.

24
00:01:21,005 --> 00:01:23,845
And then I will take over
as leader of the party.

25
00:01:23,965 --> 00:01:27,325
<i>It's going to be a busy few weeks,
brother.</i>

26
00:01:47,805 --> 00:01:50,085
Mmm.

27
00:01:56,005 --> 00:01:58,125
You prefer Irish to Scotch?

28
00:01:59,845 --> 00:02:01,205
Yes, Mr Churchill.

29
00:02:05,445 --> 00:02:06,725
Irish over Scotch.

30
00:02:08,125 --> 00:02:10,285
Cigarettes over Havana cigars.

31
00:02:11,285 --> 00:02:13,525
And your mother
was probably born in a tent.

32
00:02:15,285 --> 00:02:16,765
Grandmother in a tent.

33
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:19,725
My mother on a narrow boat.

34
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:25,525
And always happy to give smart answers
to men born better than you.

35
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:29,885
A man needs to prove he is better than me

36
00:02:30,005 --> 00:02:32,325
rather than show me his birth certificate.

37
00:02:32,445 --> 00:02:37,005
You see, I don't have one,
so they mean very little to me.

38
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:40,085
You speak beautifully in the House.

39
00:02:40,205 --> 00:02:41,885
- Thank you.
- And believe

40
00:02:42,005 --> 00:02:43,845
not a word of what you are saying.

41
00:02:45,485 --> 00:02:49,925
Conviction introduces emotion,
which is the enemy of oratory.

42
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:52,365
You read Greek literature.

43
00:02:52,485 --> 00:02:53,845
I have trouble sleeping.

44
00:02:58,085 --> 00:03:00,845
Is there a reason for your visit,
Mr Churchill?

45
00:03:01,845 --> 00:03:05,525
You are forming an alliance
with a fascist.

46
00:03:05,645 --> 00:03:10,845
So I made some enquiries
amongst the worst people in Whitehall,

47
00:03:10,965 --> 00:03:15,365
and I found out that you are not
forming an alliance with him at all.

48
00:03:16,605 --> 00:03:18,245
You are spying on him.

49
00:03:18,365 --> 00:03:20,165
Yes.

50
00:03:20,285 --> 00:03:21,285
Why?

51
00:03:24,645 --> 00:03:26,165
The honest answer is...

52
00:03:28,085 --> 00:03:29,365
...I'm no longer sure.

53
00:03:29,485 --> 00:03:32,765
Do you dig your own garden, Mr Shelby?

54
00:03:34,685 --> 00:03:36,005
I have a gardener.

55
00:03:37,085 --> 00:03:39,805
In fact, I have three gardeners.

56
00:03:41,245 --> 00:03:44,685
Three generations of men
with no ambition...

57
00:03:46,085 --> 00:03:48,125
...who are happier than I will ever be.

58
00:03:48,245 --> 00:03:52,085
Well, if you ask them, they will tell you

59
00:03:52,205 --> 00:03:54,725
that there are certain species of weed

60
00:03:54,845 --> 00:03:57,125
that no matter how much you tug at them,

61
00:03:57,245 --> 00:03:58,685
poison them,

62
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:01,085
they continue to grow back.

63
00:04:01,205 --> 00:04:06,085
In the end, the only solution
is to plough up the topsoil,

64
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:07,885
create a field of mud

65
00:04:08,005 --> 00:04:10,845
and blow up and burn
the exposed taproots.

66
00:04:12,325 --> 00:04:14,925
That's what you and I did in France.

67
00:04:15,045 --> 00:04:18,685
But when I hear that man Mosley speak,

68
00:04:18,805 --> 00:04:23,565
I see the green shoots of another war
growing up around his feet.

69
00:04:25,685 --> 00:04:29,005
And you see exactly the same thing I do.

70
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:31,245
That's why you oppose him.

71
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:33,845
Yeah.

72
00:04:34,885 --> 00:04:37,405
Your mystery solved.

73
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,885
What is your strategy?

74
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,165
I won't burden you with it.

75
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,085
You're going to break the law.

76
00:04:50,685 --> 00:04:51,725
I need to sleep.

77
00:04:53,285 --> 00:04:55,285
You said you don't sleep.

78
00:04:55,405 --> 00:04:57,285
I said I have trouble sleeping.

79
00:04:58,565 --> 00:04:59,565
As do I.

80
00:05:01,205 --> 00:05:02,245
As do I.

81
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,245
Mr Shelby...

82
00:05:06,405 --> 00:05:10,285
...I have no doubt
that there was once a time in Flanders

83
00:05:10,405 --> 00:05:14,405
when you were under the ground
and I was above it,

84
00:05:14,525 --> 00:05:16,565
both working to the same end.

85
00:05:17,725 --> 00:05:23,045
We are in the same exact situation
here in Westminster.

86
00:05:25,245 --> 00:05:28,045
Do what you have to do, Mr Shelby.

87
00:05:32,285 --> 00:05:34,805
And if you need anything, call me.

88
00:05:39,765 --> 00:05:42,725
There are some times, some nights...

89
00:05:44,245 --> 00:05:48,005
...when I don't see the point
of carrying on with any of it.

90
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:49,125
Oh.

91
00:05:50,565 --> 00:05:53,125
That old dance routine.

92
00:05:54,165 --> 00:05:55,805
I put out a cigar,

93
00:05:55,925 --> 00:05:59,085
and an hour later I want another.

94
00:06:00,445 --> 00:06:04,685
Sometimes, the bridge between hours
is as fragile as that.

95
00:06:06,085 --> 00:06:07,165
But use it anyway.

96
00:06:10,525 --> 00:06:12,325
A tent.

97
00:06:12,445 --> 00:06:13,725
Then a boat.

98
00:06:13,845 --> 00:06:15,365
Then a house.

99
00:06:15,485 --> 00:06:17,405
Now a mansion.

100
00:06:17,525 --> 00:06:19,525
That's something.

101
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:20,685
Isn't it?

102
00:06:22,445 --> 00:06:25,005
Yeah, that is something.

103
00:06:28,565 --> 00:06:30,565
By the way...

104
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:36,645
...was it you who killed
that Ulsterman intelligence officer?

105
00:06:36,765 --> 00:06:38,085
I forget his name.

106
00:06:38,205 --> 00:06:39,805
Major Campbell.

107
00:06:39,925 --> 00:06:42,525
Yes, Campbell.

108
00:06:42,645 --> 00:06:44,285
No.

109
00:06:44,405 --> 00:06:45,725
It was my aunt.

110
00:06:46,845 --> 00:06:49,365
I really must come up to Birmingham
some day

111
00:06:49,485 --> 00:06:51,285
and spend an evening with your family.

112
00:06:52,805 --> 00:06:54,485
They sound interesting.

113
00:06:54,605 --> 00:06:56,085
Yes.

114
00:06:56,205 --> 00:06:58,085
They'd like that.

115
00:07:13,845 --> 00:07:16,605
I got to Harold French,
refereeing Liverpool. He just wants cash.

116
00:07:16,725 --> 00:07:18,885
Tom the tatter,
reffing Sheffield Wednesday, wants cash

117
00:07:18,925 --> 00:07:21,565
and a beating
for a bloke who's screwing his wife.

118
00:07:21,685 --> 00:07:23,965
The clap doctor said go easy
on the whiskey, yeah?

119
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:26,245
Finn.

120
00:07:28,165 --> 00:07:29,325
You don't knock?

121
00:07:30,565 --> 00:07:32,085
No, Finn.

122
00:07:32,205 --> 00:07:34,325
I don't knock.

123
00:07:36,045 --> 00:07:37,205
Right.

124
00:07:38,885 --> 00:07:40,045
Hello, Billy.

125
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:42,885
How are you, mate?

126
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:44,405
Good, Mr Shelby.

127
00:07:44,525 --> 00:07:46,765
Yeah, you look good.

128
00:07:46,885 --> 00:07:49,165
That's a nice suit.

129
00:07:49,285 --> 00:07:50,645
Thank you, Mr Shelby.

130
00:07:50,765 --> 00:07:52,245
He earned that suit.

131
00:07:52,365 --> 00:07:55,605
We made more on the matches
than we did on the races last Saturday.

132
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:56,725
He's a good man.

133
00:07:56,845 --> 00:07:59,485
Yeah, I know that. Mm.

134
00:07:59,605 --> 00:08:01,605
You're coming up in the world, I like it.

135
00:08:03,805 --> 00:08:05,845
How's the missus, hmm?

136
00:08:06,925 --> 00:08:09,885
The old trouble and strife,
as the cockneys like to call it.

137
00:08:10,005 --> 00:08:11,165
She moved out.

138
00:08:11,285 --> 00:08:13,285
Oh, that's a shame.

139
00:08:13,405 --> 00:08:15,645
Mind if I join you, eh?

140
00:08:15,765 --> 00:08:20,045
Mind if I join the party?
Look at this, having some fun. Hmm?

141
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:24,485
You're a good man, Billy.

142
00:08:26,445 --> 00:08:28,125
You're a good man, eh?

143
00:08:29,285 --> 00:08:32,085
You could sing like a bird in a cage.

144
00:08:32,205 --> 00:08:34,165
And what did we do, eh?

145
00:08:34,285 --> 00:08:39,445
We opened that cage,
and the real man flies out,

146
00:08:39,565 --> 00:08:42,005
reveals himself.

147
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,445
The truth is young, Billy boy.

148
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,005
Yeah.

149
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,565
Here, look.

150
00:08:47,685 --> 00:08:50,045
What have we got here? Oh, look.

151
00:08:50,165 --> 00:08:52,565
Look at that, Billy boy, eh?

152
00:08:52,685 --> 00:08:54,245
Then there's some snow there, look.

153
00:08:54,365 --> 00:08:58,045
Oh, there's more.
Look, snowflakes, Billy.

154
00:08:58,165 --> 00:08:59,965
Now, I know you like that, hmm?

155
00:09:00,085 --> 00:09:01,325
Well, I do too.

156
00:09:01,445 --> 00:09:04,605
So, I'll tell you what, why don't we have
a little line together?

157
00:09:04,725 --> 00:09:06,965
Eh? Why don't we do
a little bit of snow together?

158
00:09:08,205 --> 00:09:10,765
Oh, spilt it all down you an' all.

159
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:13,125
It's the eyes. Sorry, mate.

160
00:09:13,245 --> 00:09:15,725
Hey, what can I do?
I'm messy, aren't I, Billy?

161
00:09:15,845 --> 00:09:17,205
I do apologise.

162
00:09:17,325 --> 00:09:19,365
And you. Hmm?

163
00:09:19,485 --> 00:09:20,565
Look at you.

164
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:24,125
Sitting here with your mate, eh?
Your best mate.

165
00:09:24,245 --> 00:09:25,845
Well, while you're sitting here,

166
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:28,245
talking about our business,

167
00:09:28,365 --> 00:09:31,285
drinking whiskey, smoking and sniffing...

168
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,205
- Hmm?
- And working.

169
00:09:33,325 --> 00:09:36,725
You remember, you tell this man

170
00:09:36,845 --> 00:09:39,325
about our family business...

171
00:09:41,405 --> 00:09:43,165
...and it's his life you're risking.

172
00:09:43,285 --> 00:09:44,925
Cos people talk, Finn.

173
00:09:45,045 --> 00:09:47,565
We... we only ever talk about football
and women, Mr Shelby.

174
00:09:50,285 --> 00:09:51,405
Football and women,

175
00:09:51,525 --> 00:09:53,821
we only ever... we only ever talk
about football and women.

176
00:09:53,845 --> 00:09:55,565
- Oh, do you?
- Yeah.

177
00:09:55,685 --> 00:09:57,365
It's...

178
00:09:57,485 --> 00:09:58,685
Hmm.

179
00:10:00,405 --> 00:10:01,925
Yeah.

180
00:10:04,485 --> 00:10:05,805
Come on.

181
00:10:05,925 --> 00:10:07,365
Family meeting, let's go.

182
00:10:18,805 --> 00:10:20,725
You're not eating right.
You're not eating right.

183
00:10:20,845 --> 00:10:24,925
You're not getting the natural things
in you, boy, that's what it is, always.

184
00:10:31,645 --> 00:10:33,725
You bearing up, Arthur?

185
00:10:33,845 --> 00:10:35,405
Bearing up for what?

186
00:10:36,685 --> 00:10:38,845
Bearing up to being free, Pol.

187
00:10:41,925 --> 00:10:43,685
Another glass, eh?

188
00:10:43,805 --> 00:10:45,925
Another glass of so what.

189
00:10:52,805 --> 00:10:54,645
Are you all right, Charlie?

190
00:10:56,525 --> 00:10:58,885
Mad bastard Barney kicked me
in the shin when I woke him up.

191
00:10:59,005 --> 00:11:00,325
Where is the mad bastard?

192
00:11:02,005 --> 00:11:04,485
He's tied to a lamp-post outside
with three Lee boys,

193
00:11:04,605 --> 00:11:06,605
shitting themselves.

194
00:11:08,645 --> 00:11:10,245
A drink.

195
00:11:18,445 --> 00:11:19,765
First of all,

196
00:11:19,885 --> 00:11:24,845
an apology from Lizzie -
she can't be here.

197
00:11:24,965 --> 00:11:28,525
Charles has a violin concert.

198
00:11:29,885 --> 00:11:33,365
Also, a welcome to Mr Aberama Gold.

199
00:11:34,325 --> 00:11:38,965
He and Polly are to be married
in three weeks, with my blessing.

200
00:11:39,085 --> 00:11:43,005
From now on, Aberama will be welcome
at our meetings.

201
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:46,045
First item of business, a bereavement.

202
00:11:47,525 --> 00:11:49,005
Colonel Ben Younger,

203
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:52,565
who may perhaps have become
a member of this family,

204
00:11:52,685 --> 00:11:54,205
was taken from us,

205
00:11:54,325 --> 00:11:56,405
four days ago,

206
00:11:56,525 --> 00:11:58,205
by dark forces.

207
00:11:58,325 --> 00:12:00,645
We've made some investigations,

208
00:12:00,765 --> 00:12:02,725
and we think we know
who planted the bomb.

209
00:12:02,845 --> 00:12:05,485
In the meantime,
our thoughts are with Ada

210
00:12:05,605 --> 00:12:08,365
and the baby inside of her,

211
00:12:08,485 --> 00:12:11,885
who may one day sit at these meetings,

212
00:12:12,005 --> 00:12:15,565
but hopefully
under happier circumstances.

213
00:12:15,685 --> 00:12:18,125
Let's drink to happier circumstances.

214
00:12:18,245 --> 00:12:19,605
Yeah.

215
00:12:21,045 --> 00:12:22,285
To Ada.

216
00:12:22,405 --> 00:12:25,805
- To Ada.
- Ada.

217
00:12:26,885 --> 00:12:29,405
Item number two.

218
00:12:29,525 --> 00:12:30,965
An announcement,

219
00:12:31,085 --> 00:12:32,165
regarding Michael.

220
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:35,245
Before you go on, Tommy,

221
00:12:35,365 --> 00:12:39,205
there's something I'd like to say
to the whole family directly,

222
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:42,325
regarding finances
and the future of this company.

223
00:12:42,445 --> 00:12:44,925
According to your own estimations,

224
00:12:45,045 --> 00:12:48,725
this new venture of the delivery
and shipment of opium

225
00:12:48,845 --> 00:12:51,765
will bring into the company
around £2 million per year.

226
00:12:51,885 --> 00:12:54,045
Therefore,

227
00:12:54,165 --> 00:12:56,565
due to the amounts involved,

228
00:12:56,685 --> 00:12:58,725
I think this company
should be restructured.

229
00:12:58,845 --> 00:13:02,645
Michael, I think this can wait
till outside the family meeting.

230
00:13:02,765 --> 00:13:03,965
Restructured in what way?

231
00:13:04,085 --> 00:13:06,045
Because of the amounts
of money involved,

232
00:13:06,165 --> 00:13:08,005
shipment and dispatch will become

233
00:13:08,125 --> 00:13:10,605
the primary source of income
to the company.

234
00:13:10,725 --> 00:13:13,245
It's simple mathematics.

235
00:13:13,365 --> 00:13:14,605
And with the help of my wife,

236
00:13:14,725 --> 00:13:17,565
I will organise an expansion into America,

237
00:13:17,685 --> 00:13:20,765
where the narcotics business
is just beginning to grow.

238
00:13:20,885 --> 00:13:23,645
So I have very good contacts in Detroit,

239
00:13:23,765 --> 00:13:27,405
New York, Boston,
who I've already spoken to about this.

240
00:13:27,525 --> 00:13:30,286
And Gina has family who are
very experienced in this kind of business.

241
00:13:31,765 --> 00:13:34,445
According to the conversations
I've had with them,

242
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:35,925
with a regular supply

243
00:13:36,045 --> 00:13:37,725
of pure opium from China,

244
00:13:37,845 --> 00:13:40,125
within a short space of time,

245
00:13:40,245 --> 00:13:46,005
the American narcotics business
will bring in $20 million per annum.

246
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:52,165
Enough money for you to all enjoy
an easing of the burden you all now feel.

247
00:13:53,485 --> 00:13:58,205
See, I know that the scars
and the wounds,

248
00:13:58,325 --> 00:13:59,885
they're on the inside,

249
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,525
not on the outside.

250
00:14:01,645 --> 00:14:03,845
And as a member of the new generation,

251
00:14:03,965 --> 00:14:07,765
I'm able to take that great burden
off your weary shoulders.

252
00:14:09,285 --> 00:14:11,405
A new decade is coming.

253
00:14:11,525 --> 00:14:14,605
There'll be new opportunities
in new territories.

254
00:14:14,725 --> 00:14:16,325
More money than we've ever had before.

255
00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:19,685
Tommy,

256
00:14:19,805 --> 00:14:23,045
you can still do the good work
that deep down you want to do.

257
00:14:25,005 --> 00:14:29,285
Mum, you can get married
and live in that big house.

258
00:14:29,405 --> 00:14:31,765
Arthur, you can be the man
that Linda wants you to be.

259
00:14:31,885 --> 00:14:33,445
Fuck Linda.

260
00:14:36,445 --> 00:14:37,445
Finn.

261
00:14:39,085 --> 00:14:40,085
You've proved yourself.

262
00:14:42,405 --> 00:14:44,045
You're part of the new generation.

263
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,925
You could come to New York with me.

264
00:14:52,405 --> 00:14:54,285
Here is my proposal.

265
00:14:55,925 --> 00:14:57,965
A full restructuring of the company.

266
00:14:58,085 --> 00:15:01,165
I will be managing director.

267
00:15:01,285 --> 00:15:03,445
And you can be non executive chairman.

268
00:15:03,565 --> 00:15:06,565
But under an assumed name,
to protect your reputation.

269
00:15:07,645 --> 00:15:09,205
I've found the name of a dead man.

270
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,405
You will be registered as Mr Jones.

271
00:15:13,965 --> 00:15:17,765
You will each receive a percentage
of the profits as an annuity,

272
00:15:17,885 --> 00:15:23,445
and you will no longer have to engage
in any of the associated activities.

273
00:15:27,965 --> 00:15:30,205
Take a look at the future, Tommy.

274
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,445
At least read it with an open mind.

275
00:15:41,725 --> 00:15:43,005
It's cold in here, Michael.

276
00:15:44,605 --> 00:15:46,845
Tommy, the Americans want to deal with me.

277
00:15:46,965 --> 00:15:48,325
Item number three.

278
00:15:48,445 --> 00:15:50,725
Tell him the truth.

279
00:15:50,845 --> 00:15:51,885
Go on.

280
00:15:52,925 --> 00:15:54,805
He can take it.

281
00:16:00,565 --> 00:16:02,725
Tell me the truth, Michael.

282
00:16:05,285 --> 00:16:09,365
The Americans don't want to deal with
an old-fashioned backstreet razor gang.

283
00:16:09,485 --> 00:16:11,445
Those days are done.

284
00:16:15,645 --> 00:16:18,245
Tommy. He's bitten through
the fucking rope.

285
00:16:18,365 --> 00:16:19,661
They've got him cornered,
but they need help.

286
00:16:19,685 --> 00:16:21,565
Go and get him!

287
00:16:24,685 --> 00:16:26,565
Fuck the Americans.

288
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:39,445
I'm doing this for you, Tommy.

289
00:16:41,045 --> 00:16:42,525
It's time.

290
00:16:44,325 --> 00:16:45,445
And you know it.

291
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:48,445
Tommy, Mum's leaving...

292
00:16:49,685 --> 00:16:52,885
...John's dead, Arthur needs help,

293
00:16:53,005 --> 00:16:56,565
Ada's man was killed in your own back yard
because you fucked up.

294
00:16:58,365 --> 00:17:01,765
Go on, Tom. Go on, cut me.

295
00:17:02,885 --> 00:17:04,365
Like the good old days.

296
00:17:05,445 --> 00:17:06,445
Or...

297
00:17:07,565 --> 00:17:09,845
...see this for what it is.

298
00:17:11,725 --> 00:17:13,245
A natural succession...

299
00:17:14,285 --> 00:17:15,965
...that someday must happen.

300
00:17:21,645 --> 00:17:24,125
I gave you an opportunity, Michael.
You betrayed me.

301
00:17:25,365 --> 00:17:26,805
Don't be here when I get back.

302
00:17:26,925 --> 00:17:27,925
You.

303
00:17:29,325 --> 00:17:30,725
You can tell your family...

304
00:17:30,845 --> 00:17:32,805
Let me guess.

305
00:17:32,925 --> 00:17:34,565
Don't fuck with the Peaky Blinders.

306
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:39,125
Right?

307
00:18:08,685 --> 00:18:10,805
Well...

308
00:18:10,925 --> 00:18:13,165
...guess we're gonna be forced
to take the second option.

309
00:18:17,885 --> 00:18:19,925
They're not fucking voices!

310
00:18:20,045 --> 00:18:23,165
Whoa! Whoa! Calm down.

311
00:18:23,285 --> 00:18:26,485
- Put the gun down.
- They're not fucking voices!

312
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,005
Barney!

313
00:18:29,085 --> 00:18:30,245
Barney!

314
00:18:32,005 --> 00:18:34,365
Put down the gun. At ease.

315
00:18:35,725 --> 00:18:36,845
Finn.

316
00:18:39,205 --> 00:18:40,965
At ease, soldier. At ease.

317
00:18:41,085 --> 00:18:43,005
Look at me. You're on our side.

318
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,045
You're at home.

319
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,365
You're at home.

320
00:18:46,485 --> 00:18:48,725
Yeah? Yeah.

321
00:18:48,845 --> 00:18:51,685
Here. Take this, Barney. Jeremiah?

322
00:18:51,805 --> 00:18:53,645
Yeah.

323
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:56,325
Take him to Charlie's yard
before he falls over.

324
00:18:56,445 --> 00:18:57,685
The devil will now be an angel.

325
00:18:57,725 --> 00:18:59,725
Isiah, Curly, you go with him.

326
00:18:59,845 --> 00:19:00,925
Come, brother.

327
00:19:01,045 --> 00:19:02,645
Let me give you the good news.

328
00:19:02,765 --> 00:19:04,045
Jesus loves you.

329
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:06,485
So, where the fuck is he?

330
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:07,685
All right, boys.

331
00:19:07,805 --> 00:19:12,765
A subsidiary meeting of the generation
that actually do the work.

332
00:19:27,005 --> 00:19:29,085
Right.

333
00:19:29,205 --> 00:19:30,725
Let's have the good stuff.

334
00:19:30,845 --> 00:19:33,005
None of that shit ponces' drink.

335
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:35,085
Here we go, look.

336
00:19:35,205 --> 00:19:37,965
All right, so item number three.

337
00:19:38,085 --> 00:19:39,925
An introduction.

338
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:44,165
Except now you've already met the man
I was going to introduce.

339
00:19:44,285 --> 00:19:46,125
In France, he was a comrade.

340
00:19:46,245 --> 00:19:47,565
What the fuck is he now, Tom?

341
00:19:47,685 --> 00:19:50,125
He's a man we can use, Johnny.

342
00:19:50,245 --> 00:19:52,965
For what? Put him in a ring with a bear
and take bets on the outcome?

343
00:19:53,085 --> 00:19:56,045
I tell you, I wouldn't put much money
on the fucking bear.

344
00:19:57,725 --> 00:19:59,725
Aberama,

345
00:19:59,845 --> 00:20:03,765
that man is a trained Royal Marine sniper.

346
00:20:03,885 --> 00:20:05,925
Furthermore, he has a criminal profile

347
00:20:06,045 --> 00:20:09,285
which will make his actions explicable
to the police.

348
00:20:09,405 --> 00:20:11,205
What actions?

349
00:20:11,325 --> 00:20:12,765
A killing.

350
00:20:13,965 --> 00:20:16,045
And since when
did you worry about the police?

351
00:20:18,565 --> 00:20:19,685
Barney Thomason...

352
00:20:21,085 --> 00:20:22,845
...is gonna kill an MP.

353
00:20:22,965 --> 00:20:25,805
Possibly the future prime minister
of Great Britain.

354
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:28,245
What the fuck, Tom?

355
00:20:33,645 --> 00:20:35,565
After the killing,

356
00:20:35,685 --> 00:20:38,205
there will be an investigation
by Special Branch

357
00:20:38,325 --> 00:20:39,485
and Intelligence forces.

358
00:20:41,165 --> 00:20:45,405
There will be a lot of powerful people
as angry as fucking hornets.

359
00:20:45,525 --> 00:20:48,165
We need there to be no connection to us.

360
00:20:48,285 --> 00:20:50,565
Barney Thomason is registered
as criminally insane.

361
00:20:50,685 --> 00:20:53,085
He broke out. He's an old soldier.

362
00:20:53,205 --> 00:20:55,045
He has known grievances.

363
00:20:55,165 --> 00:20:59,125
No-one will question
that the assassination was carried out

364
00:20:59,245 --> 00:21:01,605
by a single gunman acting alone.

365
00:21:01,725 --> 00:21:04,925
And you'd sacrifice an old comrade?

366
00:21:05,045 --> 00:21:07,285
If they catch him,

367
00:21:07,405 --> 00:21:10,685
they won't hang him
on grounds of insanity,

368
00:21:10,805 --> 00:21:13,445
just send him back to where I found him.

369
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:15,245
He'll have had a very eventful holiday

370
00:21:15,365 --> 00:21:17,725
that he'll probably believe
never really happened.

371
00:21:17,845 --> 00:21:19,805
And where will this killing take place?

372
00:21:24,685 --> 00:21:25,685
There you go.

373
00:21:33,285 --> 00:21:34,365
He'll be on stage.

374
00:21:34,485 --> 00:21:36,645
With lots...

375
00:21:37,685 --> 00:21:39,005
...of witnesses.

376
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,205
During the rally,

377
00:21:41,325 --> 00:21:44,005
there will be
an anti-fascist demonstration.

378
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:47,045
Amidst the confusion,
a shot will be fired.

379
00:21:47,165 --> 00:21:48,845
And we're organising this demonstration?

380
00:21:48,965 --> 00:21:50,085
Yeah.

381
00:21:50,205 --> 00:21:51,925
Where will you be, Tom?

382
00:21:55,285 --> 00:21:57,445
I'll be down on one knee,
cradling his head...

383
00:21:58,605 --> 00:22:00,005
...while the life drains from him.

384
00:22:01,725 --> 00:22:03,125
Then I'll make a speech...

385
00:22:04,325 --> 00:22:06,805
...saying how the cause he died for
must continue...

386
00:22:08,605 --> 00:22:10,085
...continue safe in my hands.

387
00:22:11,325 --> 00:22:12,445
Holy fuck.

388
00:22:13,765 --> 00:22:15,125
Tommy...

389
00:22:16,525 --> 00:22:18,285
...does your ambition have no limits?

390
00:22:21,565 --> 00:22:24,405
Jimmy McCavern will be running security
at this event.

391
00:22:25,685 --> 00:22:27,165
He'll probably be in the wings.

392
00:22:28,405 --> 00:22:30,965
You can take his life
whichever manner you choose.

393
00:22:36,045 --> 00:22:37,965
What do you want us to do, Tom?

394
00:22:38,085 --> 00:22:40,085
You and Arthur
and a couple of the Lee boys,

395
00:22:40,205 --> 00:22:42,765
you'll be in charge
of getting Barney into position.

396
00:22:42,885 --> 00:22:45,125
He'll be up in the lighting gantry.

397
00:22:45,245 --> 00:22:46,725
We'll need chains and a twitch, Tom.

398
00:22:46,845 --> 00:22:48,845
No. I will medicate him.

399
00:22:48,965 --> 00:22:52,445
So he's gonna be cross-eyed
when he takes the shot?

400
00:22:52,565 --> 00:22:55,805
In France, he never missed...

401
00:22:56,845 --> 00:22:58,445
...no matter what they gave him.

402
00:22:59,725 --> 00:23:02,205
He'll have had plenty of target practice.

403
00:23:02,325 --> 00:23:04,045
Before he takes the shot,

404
00:23:04,165 --> 00:23:08,205
Arthur here will give him some cocaine
to sharpen him up.

405
00:23:08,325 --> 00:23:09,925
So just...

406
00:23:10,045 --> 00:23:11,725
You're gonna be up on the stage

407
00:23:11,845 --> 00:23:14,965
while this criminally insane gunman
filled with cocaine

408
00:23:15,085 --> 00:23:18,365
takes aim at a man
just a yard away from you?

409
00:23:20,445 --> 00:23:22,365
Welcome to the family, Aberama.

410
00:23:22,485 --> 00:23:25,805
What about me, Thomas?
The man with the broken fucking leg.

411
00:23:28,565 --> 00:23:29,925
After the killing,

412
00:23:30,045 --> 00:23:33,445
every copper in Birmingham
will be sent to Bingley Hall.

413
00:23:33,565 --> 00:23:35,725
Use that opportunity

414
00:23:35,845 --> 00:23:39,165
to get that boat full of opium
up to Stourbridge locks.

415
00:23:39,285 --> 00:23:44,485
There, you'll be met
by some Chinese gentlemen.

416
00:23:44,605 --> 00:23:46,485
They will have two suitcases full of cash.

417
00:23:47,925 --> 00:23:49,725
£250,000.

418
00:23:52,205 --> 00:23:56,365
Every man in this room
will receive $30,000 in cash,

419
00:23:56,485 --> 00:23:58,365
in recognition of extra services.

420
00:23:58,485 --> 00:24:01,805
Holy Mary, Mother of God, Tom!

421
00:24:03,205 --> 00:24:07,165
Anyone who wants to leave,
leave now.

422
00:24:08,445 --> 00:24:11,685
Anyone who is tired
of this old-fashioned,

423
00:24:11,805 --> 00:24:15,765
backstreet fucking razor gang can leave.

424
00:24:15,885 --> 00:24:19,525
Anyone who's tired can fucking stop.

425
00:24:23,645 --> 00:24:24,765
Good.

426
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:29,645
Charlie, go to the yard and light a fire.

427
00:24:29,765 --> 00:24:31,845
Johnny, bring the van round.

428
00:24:31,965 --> 00:24:34,965
What's the fire for, Tom?

429
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,725
There is an item number four.

430
00:25:00,205 --> 00:25:01,365
It's time.

431
00:25:28,445 --> 00:25:30,125
Jeez, Mr Shelby.

432
00:25:30,245 --> 00:25:33,005
If I'd have known, I'd have come in early
and served you drinks, huh?

433
00:25:37,205 --> 00:25:38,645
Here, Micky.

434
00:25:41,605 --> 00:25:42,685
Sit down there.

435
00:26:02,005 --> 00:26:03,445
So I'll have a drink, will I?

436
00:26:07,645 --> 00:26:09,165
Here you go, have a drink.

437
00:26:16,765 --> 00:26:18,765
A few days ago, I went to London, Micky.

438
00:26:22,245 --> 00:26:23,445
To collect some cargo.

439
00:26:26,845 --> 00:26:28,765
I was met by the Titanic boys.

440
00:26:31,125 --> 00:26:32,965
They knew I was coming.

441
00:26:35,125 --> 00:26:38,925
Yeah. When, where, what time.

442
00:26:39,045 --> 00:26:40,165
They even knew...

443
00:26:41,685 --> 00:26:42,861
...the cargo I was picking up.

444
00:26:42,885 --> 00:26:44,085
Jesus.

445
00:26:44,205 --> 00:26:46,125
Four days ago, Micky...

446
00:26:47,125 --> 00:26:48,525
...a soldier was killed...

447
00:26:49,565 --> 00:26:50,925
...outside my office...

448
00:26:52,205 --> 00:26:53,285
...by a bomb.

449
00:26:53,405 --> 00:26:57,045
Yeah, erm, the papers said that was IRA.

450
00:26:57,165 --> 00:26:58,325
No, it wasn't the IRA, Micky.

451
00:26:58,445 --> 00:27:01,245
No. It weren't the IRA.

452
00:27:05,005 --> 00:27:11,285
I spoke to the girls who work
at the Digbeth telephone exchange.

453
00:27:11,405 --> 00:27:12,525
They're friends of mine.

454
00:27:15,525 --> 00:27:20,605
I asked them what calls were made
around the time of the explosion.

455
00:27:22,805 --> 00:27:24,005
They told me that...

456
00:27:26,205 --> 00:27:30,245
...30 minutes before the explosion
a call was made to a man in Sparkhill

457
00:27:30,365 --> 00:27:33,885
who has connections
to the Ulster Volunteer Force.

458
00:27:34,005 --> 00:27:36,365
He now offers his services for cash.

459
00:27:42,405 --> 00:27:44,285
Paddy Rose.

460
00:27:48,325 --> 00:27:50,645
Yeah, me and my brother,
we spoke to Paddy.

461
00:27:51,925 --> 00:27:53,085
At length.

462
00:27:54,245 --> 00:27:56,965
He told us it was him
that planted the bomb.

463
00:27:59,285 --> 00:28:00,325
Yeah, we spoke to him.

464
00:28:05,125 --> 00:28:07,005
We killed him, Micky.

465
00:28:08,965 --> 00:28:10,405
Paddy Rose is dead.

466
00:28:10,525 --> 00:28:12,645
We weighed him down,

467
00:28:12,765 --> 00:28:14,765
we sunk him...

468
00:28:14,885 --> 00:28:17,045
...to the bottom of the Grand Union Canal.

469
00:28:22,605 --> 00:28:24,765
The girls at the exchange
gave me the number

470
00:28:24,885 --> 00:28:27,045
of the man that called, Micky,
before the explosion.

471
00:28:27,165 --> 00:28:28,445
That was your number.

472
00:28:30,645 --> 00:28:33,525
Micky, it was you who called him.

473
00:28:34,925 --> 00:28:35,925
You tipped him off.

474
00:28:38,645 --> 00:28:39,765
You were told to call him

475
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:42,445
if a black man of a certain description
ever came to Small Heath.

476
00:28:50,045 --> 00:28:53,645
We know you've... you've been giving
the Titanic boys information as well.

477
00:28:55,205 --> 00:28:56,205
We know that.

478
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:59,005
Yeah.

479
00:28:59,125 --> 00:29:02,085
You've been working behind the bar, hmm?

480
00:29:02,205 --> 00:29:06,685
Seeing what goes on, listening,
taking notes,

481
00:29:06,805 --> 00:29:10,565
and selling your stories
to the highest bidder. Hmm?

482
00:29:14,325 --> 00:29:16,245
Yeah.

483
00:29:16,365 --> 00:29:17,365
Come on.

484
00:29:20,205 --> 00:29:21,285
Come on, man.

485
00:29:30,805 --> 00:29:33,525
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.

486
00:29:44,925 --> 00:29:46,365
I'm sorry, Mr Shelby.

487
00:29:53,365 --> 00:29:55,645
Don't look at Tommy.

488
00:30:01,205 --> 00:30:03,765
The ceiling would be cheaper, brother.

489
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,125
Micky!

490
00:30:18,165 --> 00:30:19,805
Fucking hell, Arthur.

491
00:30:19,925 --> 00:30:21,165
Eh?

492
00:30:21,285 --> 00:30:23,285
Shaking like the hand of a normal man.

493
00:30:31,005 --> 00:30:33,285
What about item five, Tom?

494
00:30:33,405 --> 00:30:34,445
Huh?

495
00:30:36,285 --> 00:30:39,485
There is an item five, right, Tommy?

496
00:30:40,685 --> 00:30:42,605
I'm fucking sinking here, man.

497
00:30:46,765 --> 00:30:48,245
I'm fucking sinking, Tom.

498
00:30:49,805 --> 00:30:51,845
You... you... you said
there's an item five.

499
00:30:51,965 --> 00:30:53,565
Say it, Tommy.

500
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:57,605
Item five could start now, Tommy.

501
00:30:57,725 --> 00:31:01,005
It could start this year, a new decade.

502
00:31:02,205 --> 00:31:03,645
M-M-Michael...

503
00:31:03,765 --> 00:31:06,165
Michael could be right -
we could go, Tommy.

504
00:31:06,285 --> 00:31:08,005
We could go.

505
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:10,085
We could fucking leave this place.

506
00:31:10,205 --> 00:31:11,925
We could leave it to the kids.

507
00:31:12,045 --> 00:31:14,485
Michael's... He might be right.

508
00:31:14,605 --> 00:31:16,525
- He might be fucking right.
- Arthur!

509
00:31:16,645 --> 00:31:20,565
There is no item number five!

510
00:31:33,285 --> 00:31:35,405
Go and check
that Polly is still on our side.

511
00:31:36,685 --> 00:31:38,245
I have to go to Margate.

512
00:31:38,365 --> 00:31:39,645
All right, Tom.

513
00:31:42,605 --> 00:31:43,885
All right, brother!

514
00:31:49,645 --> 00:31:52,885
Oh, God. Jesus Christ.

515
00:32:11,965 --> 00:32:13,405
You out there, Tommy?

516
00:32:15,365 --> 00:32:17,445
Yeah. I'm here.

517
00:32:17,565 --> 00:32:22,605
I was just having some oil rubbed
into the bits that really hurt, mate.

518
00:32:22,725 --> 00:32:25,805
What do you think of that view, eh?

519
00:32:27,325 --> 00:32:29,325
It's Margate. What can you do?

520
00:32:33,925 --> 00:32:35,261
I'll tell you something, Tommy, right?

521
00:32:35,285 --> 00:32:38,565
I sit all day every day in that chair,

522
00:32:38,685 --> 00:32:42,525
on that balcony,
contemplating the fact, right,

523
00:32:42,645 --> 00:32:45,925
that life is so much easier to deal with
when you are dead!

524
00:32:49,805 --> 00:32:52,725
- Hello, Alfie.
- Yeah.

525
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:54,845
Did you... did you look
through the binoculars?

526
00:32:54,965 --> 00:32:56,045
Yeah.

527
00:32:56,165 --> 00:32:58,245
I watch ships. No two are the same.

528
00:32:58,365 --> 00:33:00,205
Yeah.

529
00:33:00,325 --> 00:33:03,765
That is how God sees us both, in his eyes.

530
00:33:03,885 --> 00:33:05,245
God, eh?

531
00:33:05,365 --> 00:33:06,845
Yeah, sort of. I mean, you know.

532
00:33:06,965 --> 00:33:09,765
Someone's responsible
for all this fucking mess.

533
00:33:11,325 --> 00:33:12,325
Now...

534
00:33:12,405 --> 00:33:15,205
How soon did you know
that I was not dead?

535
00:33:15,325 --> 00:33:16,845
You wrote me a letter, Alfie.

536
00:33:16,965 --> 00:33:18,165
Did I?

537
00:33:18,285 --> 00:33:20,045
Yeah, you asked about your dog.

538
00:33:21,085 --> 00:33:23,725
They gave me a lot of drugs at first.

539
00:33:23,845 --> 00:33:26,405
Hmm. Yeah, all right.

540
00:33:26,525 --> 00:33:28,165
I was lying out there,

541
00:33:28,285 --> 00:33:31,205
and the tide had come in,
and it woke me up.

542
00:33:32,325 --> 00:33:35,005
I remember looking around
and thinking, you know...

543
00:33:36,325 --> 00:33:37,405
..."Fuck...

544
00:33:38,605 --> 00:33:40,405
"...if this is hell...

545
00:33:41,605 --> 00:33:43,485
"...it looks a lot like Margate."

546
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:46,605
Maybe that's just what hell looks like,
eh?

547
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:50,525
No, no, not according
to this holy book right here, yeah?

548
00:33:50,645 --> 00:33:53,765
It gives a very, very vivid description.

549
00:33:53,885 --> 00:33:55,685
You and I are both fucked, mate.

550
00:33:59,565 --> 00:34:01,405
Do you read the papers, Alfie?

551
00:34:01,525 --> 00:34:03,365
No, don't be silly.

552
00:34:04,725 --> 00:34:05,845
But you've heard.

553
00:34:05,965 --> 00:34:07,725
What, fascism, yeah?

554
00:34:10,645 --> 00:34:11,765
Three,

555
00:34:11,885 --> 00:34:13,485
two,

556
00:34:13,605 --> 00:34:15,325
one,

557
00:34:15,445 --> 00:34:16,925
bang.

558
00:34:17,045 --> 00:34:18,125
No?

559
00:34:20,365 --> 00:34:21,765
Fine.

560
00:34:23,045 --> 00:34:25,485
Good Lord, your fucking condition
has got worse, mate.

561
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,365
Mine, on the other hand,

562
00:34:28,485 --> 00:34:30,125
I've been living the dream.

563
00:34:30,245 --> 00:34:33,245
Sometimes, I will shoot
at the side of a ship.

564
00:34:33,365 --> 00:34:36,125
And sometimes I'll sit here,
I may shoot at the old seagull.

565
00:34:36,245 --> 00:34:37,445
Alfie...

566
00:34:40,565 --> 00:34:42,725
...I'm gonna shoot Oswald Mosley.

567
00:34:42,845 --> 00:34:44,085
Right, well...

568
00:34:45,245 --> 00:34:48,245
...I hope you do a better job on him
than the one you done on me, yeah?

569
00:34:49,685 --> 00:34:54,365
I mean, what... what were you thinking?
Was your mind somewhere else, Tommy?

570
00:34:56,085 --> 00:34:57,805
Yes, it was, actually.

571
00:34:57,925 --> 00:35:01,245
Yeah, all right.

572
00:35:01,365 --> 00:35:03,005
Oh, look.

573
00:35:04,085 --> 00:35:05,205
A ship.

574
00:35:12,605 --> 00:35:14,165
Why do you want to shoot him?

575
00:35:15,165 --> 00:35:18,205
I need to organise a riot, Alfie.

576
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:19,325
Right.

577
00:35:19,405 --> 00:35:23,285
And I hear you still have some... standing

578
00:35:23,405 --> 00:35:25,725
in the Jewish community.

579
00:35:25,845 --> 00:35:29,205
Let me be clear, right?

580
00:35:29,325 --> 00:35:31,685
Since my resurrection,

581
00:35:31,805 --> 00:35:35,605
I am considered to be a god, all right?

582
00:35:35,725 --> 00:35:39,965
In the Holy Land,
someone has made an image of me

583
00:35:40,085 --> 00:35:43,445
out of rock embedded in the sand,
so I'm told,

584
00:35:43,565 --> 00:35:47,085
and I am planning to make
a pilgrimage to stand in my own shadow.

585
00:35:52,605 --> 00:35:56,405
Are you going to shoot him
because this man is evil?

586
00:35:56,525 --> 00:35:57,965
I need men who can fight.

587
00:35:59,045 --> 00:36:02,845
Mosley uses men from Glasgow.

588
00:36:02,965 --> 00:36:07,045
So if the men causing the trouble
are Jewish it will be... explicable.

589
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,805
Since when did you need explanations,
Tommy?

590
00:36:09,925 --> 00:36:11,805
Since I entered politics.

591
00:36:11,925 --> 00:36:13,485
Oh, that's right, yeah.

592
00:36:13,605 --> 00:36:16,685
Oh, yeah.
And how has that been for you, Tom?

593
00:36:17,965 --> 00:36:19,965
Gangs, wars, truces...

594
00:36:20,085 --> 00:36:22,045
Nothing I didn't already know.

595
00:36:26,925 --> 00:36:32,005
So you think if you kill him, you...
you will kill the message, yeah?

596
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:35,645
I will kill the man,

597
00:36:35,765 --> 00:36:37,525
then I will kill the message.

598
00:36:41,245 --> 00:36:42,605
How much you paying?

599
00:36:43,965 --> 00:36:45,541
I thought you might do it for the cause,
Alfie.

600
00:36:45,565 --> 00:36:46,565
Fuck off.

601
00:36:47,765 --> 00:36:49,565
Each man will get £20.

602
00:36:49,685 --> 00:36:51,565
You'll get £5,000.

603
00:36:51,685 --> 00:36:53,245
You know, as a god, Tommy, right,

604
00:36:53,365 --> 00:36:59,045
I am now able to just rise above
those kinds of insults, mate.

605
00:36:59,165 --> 00:37:00,685
Ten?

606
00:37:03,925 --> 00:37:05,165
How is my dog?

607
00:37:06,685 --> 00:37:07,765
Your dog is fine.

608
00:37:10,405 --> 00:37:12,325
In that case, ten should be enough.

609
00:37:12,445 --> 00:37:13,565
Where do you want the men?

610
00:37:13,685 --> 00:37:14,685
Birmingham.

611
00:37:14,725 --> 00:37:15,805
No. No.

612
00:37:15,925 --> 00:37:17,685
20 will not be enough

613
00:37:17,805 --> 00:37:20,205
for my lads to step inside
that fucking shit-hole.

614
00:37:20,325 --> 00:37:23,165
It will have to be 25 at least.

615
00:37:24,245 --> 00:37:26,885
25 it is.
You can take your dog back, then, eh?

616
00:37:27,005 --> 00:37:29,485
No, it's better for him
to think that I am still dead.

617
00:37:30,805 --> 00:37:33,085
As it is also with the police.

618
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:38,205
Right.

619
00:37:38,325 --> 00:37:40,205
So you're still at it, eh, Tommy?

620
00:37:40,325 --> 00:37:42,125
Hmm.

621
00:37:42,245 --> 00:37:44,205
You ain't got no Margate to go to.

622
00:37:46,605 --> 00:37:47,965
No.

623
00:37:50,045 --> 00:37:52,165
And I have no interest
in shooting seagulls.

624
00:37:52,285 --> 00:37:55,125
Oh, you have
in shooting Cabinet ministers?

625
00:37:55,245 --> 00:37:56,245
Yeah.

626
00:37:57,445 --> 00:37:58,845
And their paid informants.

627
00:37:58,965 --> 00:38:00,645
Mm.

628
00:38:03,205 --> 00:38:07,165
I was on a lot of drugs at first, right,
due to the pain, you know,

629
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,765
on account of it...

630
00:38:08,885 --> 00:38:14,405
Well, you know,
being shot in the face by... some cunt.

631
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:17,405
I won't bore you with the details
of the trivia.

632
00:38:17,525 --> 00:38:20,765
Nonetheless, I had a recurring dream.

633
00:38:22,365 --> 00:38:26,085
I saw you in a field, right?

634
00:38:26,205 --> 00:38:27,605
With a big black horse.

635
00:38:27,725 --> 00:38:32,645
And you said goodbye, and then... bang.

636
00:38:42,165 --> 00:38:46,125
All right, then. Well, what now?

637
00:38:59,685 --> 00:39:00,685
I will continue...

638
00:39:03,245 --> 00:39:06,845
...till I find a man that I can't defeat.

639
00:39:10,445 --> 00:39:11,805
Hmm.

640
00:39:37,805 --> 00:39:40,045
Arthur asked whose side I was on.

641
00:39:55,845 --> 00:39:57,245
There will be a war.

642
00:39:58,645 --> 00:39:59,965
And one of you will die.

643
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:03,805
But which one, I cannot tell.

644
00:40:05,285 --> 00:40:06,925
Hmm.

645
00:40:09,485 --> 00:40:10,645
He's gonna do it anyway.

646
00:40:11,805 --> 00:40:15,685
- Yeah.
- You should know,

647
00:40:15,805 --> 00:40:18,485
if Aberama takes his side,
I will kill him.

648
00:40:22,005 --> 00:40:23,285
What about me?

649
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:29,245
I'll do what I have to do, Pol.

650
00:40:31,005 --> 00:40:33,765
Kill... and kill.

651
00:40:35,365 --> 00:40:37,445
It's the only way to make people listen.

652
00:40:50,045 --> 00:40:52,365
Soon you'll have a stage to stand on.

653
00:40:54,405 --> 00:40:57,445
Millions of people will listen to you.

654
00:40:59,245 --> 00:41:04,645
And you will run the country
like you run this family.

655
00:41:04,765 --> 00:41:06,885
It appears to be what people want.

656
00:41:08,325 --> 00:41:09,325
But not me.

657
00:41:10,845 --> 00:41:12,605
Not any more.

658
00:41:12,725 --> 00:41:14,605
My resignation.

659
00:42:58,405 --> 00:43:01,005
If it's Barney you're worried about,
he's sleeping.

660
00:43:01,125 --> 00:43:03,485
But I can't sleep
because my fucking leg is cracked.

661
00:43:20,685 --> 00:43:23,965
Tell me how my mother went, Charlie.

662
00:43:27,685 --> 00:43:29,445
You know.

663
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:30,885
She drowned.

664
00:43:33,365 --> 00:43:35,605
I know it wasn't by accident.

665
00:43:44,445 --> 00:43:46,005
Tell me the truth, Charlie.

666
00:43:46,125 --> 00:43:47,845
The truth, Tommy, yeah?

667
00:43:47,965 --> 00:43:49,525
The fucking truth.

668
00:43:55,485 --> 00:43:56,525
Fuck's sake.

669
00:44:07,805 --> 00:44:09,565
She just stepped into the canal.

670
00:44:13,245 --> 00:44:14,725
Your dad was no use.

671
00:44:15,845 --> 00:44:17,845
It was me trying to stop her,
for three days.

672
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:22,405
In the end, she did it anyway.

673
00:44:27,245 --> 00:44:30,445
- Did she say why?
- Nothing that made sense.

674
00:44:32,565 --> 00:44:34,765
Tell me the things
that didn't make sense.

675
00:44:37,325 --> 00:44:41,045
She said it were the Gypsies
made the nails for Jesus's cross.

676
00:44:41,165 --> 00:44:42,925
That's why we're cursed and restless.

677
00:44:45,125 --> 00:44:47,205
Yeah, go on.

678
00:44:47,325 --> 00:44:49,925
You have to move around
or the guilt catches up with you.

679
00:44:52,645 --> 00:44:55,085
I said,
"Well, why not go on the road for a bit?"

680
00:45:02,045 --> 00:45:03,565
She went to Worcester.

681
00:45:04,725 --> 00:45:06,285
She came back with a white pony.

682
00:45:12,645 --> 00:45:13,845
That one she gave to you.

683
00:45:17,205 --> 00:45:19,525
You used to ride it round, remember?

684
00:45:24,285 --> 00:45:26,725
Well, she seemed happy for a bit,
watching you ride it.

685
00:45:30,565 --> 00:45:31,805
And then she was gone.

686
00:45:35,045 --> 00:45:37,005
None of it made any sense.

687
00:45:38,965 --> 00:45:42,485
Afterwards, whenever I looked
at that white pony, I saw her.

688
00:45:48,405 --> 00:45:50,485
You see, I was in love with her, Tom.

689
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,565
No-one knew but me.

690
00:45:57,165 --> 00:45:59,645
Broke my fucking heart
to pull her from the cut.

691
00:46:05,645 --> 00:46:08,845
You know, your grandfather,
he went the same way.

692
00:46:08,965 --> 00:46:10,925
Suicide.

693
00:46:11,045 --> 00:46:13,205
Sometimes, these things run in the family.

694
00:46:16,005 --> 00:46:18,085
Fuck family, Tom.

695
00:46:18,205 --> 00:46:20,965
You just have to get on with it.

696
00:46:21,085 --> 00:46:22,205
You're a Gypsy.

697
00:46:22,325 --> 00:46:24,565
You have to move around,
or it all catches up with you.

698
00:47:10,005 --> 00:47:13,285
Didn't need all them tablets,

699
00:47:13,405 --> 00:47:16,845
just needed another fucking war, eh?

700
00:47:45,245 --> 00:47:46,245
Perish Judah.

701
00:47:46,285 --> 00:47:47,685
Perish Judah.

702
00:47:55,285 --> 00:47:58,805
Shalom, my friends. Shalom.

703
00:47:58,925 --> 00:48:00,565
Shalom. Shalom.

704
00:48:02,805 --> 00:48:04,245
In you go, buddy.

705
00:48:23,445 --> 00:48:26,605
Show these fascist bastards no mercy,
brothers.

706
00:48:29,245 --> 00:48:32,005
The Jew and the Gypsy united.

707
00:48:32,125 --> 00:48:34,485
Look, I have got to go, yeah?
I have to go.

708
00:48:34,605 --> 00:48:35,845
Go where?

709
00:48:35,965 --> 00:48:37,645
They're shooting a fascist tonight.

710
00:48:37,765 --> 00:48:39,045
You're gonna do what?

711
00:48:39,165 --> 00:48:40,325
Ssh.

712
00:48:41,685 --> 00:48:43,805
Mosley's in town.

713
00:48:43,925 --> 00:48:45,285
Really?

714
00:48:45,405 --> 00:48:48,165
Look, go into town,

715
00:48:48,285 --> 00:48:50,285
get some drink and some girl

716
00:48:50,405 --> 00:48:52,605
and listen to the radio.

717
00:49:04,325 --> 00:49:08,485
We will not stand by and let this scum
have free rein in our city!

718
00:49:08,605 --> 00:49:13,125
Fascism must not be allowed to voice
its creed of hatred.

719
00:49:19,725 --> 00:49:21,645
Out the fucking way!

720
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:25,885
We have a right to protest!

721
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:27,285
Get back!

722
00:49:27,405 --> 00:49:30,445
Anybody heckles you,
beat the fuck out of them.

723
00:49:58,925 --> 00:50:00,925
We have a right to protest!

724
00:50:01,045 --> 00:50:03,125
We got another one. Let's go. Get, get!

725
00:50:03,245 --> 00:50:04,445
Calm yourself down.

726
00:50:05,885 --> 00:50:07,845
It's not against the law to protest.

727
00:50:10,005 --> 00:50:12,965
Out of the way.
Out of the way. Out of the way.

728
00:50:13,085 --> 00:50:14,085
Let her go.

729
00:50:14,125 --> 00:50:16,061
- I don't need the help of a fascist.
- Yes, you do.

730
00:50:16,085 --> 00:50:19,085
At Steelhouse Lane,
they'll do whatever they want to you.

731
00:50:19,205 --> 00:50:20,205
Let her go.

732
00:50:21,365 --> 00:50:24,565
I'm Tommy Shelby, and I'm ordering you
to let her fucking go. Go on.

733
00:50:26,325 --> 00:50:27,485
Fuck you.

734
00:50:27,605 --> 00:50:31,605
Jessie, you can do more damage
from the inside.

735
00:50:31,725 --> 00:50:33,725
Do you understand?

736
00:50:33,845 --> 00:50:36,405
You can do more damage from the inside.

737
00:50:37,565 --> 00:50:39,245
Come on.

738
00:50:39,365 --> 00:50:40,485
Come on.

739
00:50:40,605 --> 00:50:43,405
Out of the way. Out of the way.

740
00:50:43,525 --> 00:50:44,965
Shut up!

741
00:50:46,325 --> 00:50:48,085
Here, look.

742
00:50:48,205 --> 00:50:49,845
There, look.

743
00:50:53,845 --> 00:50:55,445
I'll join you.

744
00:50:56,645 --> 00:50:58,085
Play high.

745
00:50:58,205 --> 00:50:59,781
Now, you know what you're doing,
don't you?

746
00:50:59,805 --> 00:51:01,965
Yeah. Tommy checks his pocket watch,

747
00:51:02,085 --> 00:51:03,125
I count ten,

748
00:51:03,245 --> 00:51:04,885
then I blow the other bloke's head off.

749
00:51:05,005 --> 00:51:06,605
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

750
00:51:06,725 --> 00:51:08,005
There, that's for after.

751
00:51:08,125 --> 00:51:10,285
Thank you. Thank you.

752
00:51:10,405 --> 00:51:12,245
- See you later, Arthur.
- Oh, soldier.

753
00:51:12,365 --> 00:51:16,005
Soldier, you do that, you run like fuck.

754
00:51:16,125 --> 00:51:17,845
- Don't stop.
- Run like fuck.

755
00:51:17,965 --> 00:51:19,845
- Yeah.
- Run like fuck.

756
00:51:31,565 --> 00:51:33,085
In here.

757
00:51:37,045 --> 00:51:38,405
Here, for your face.

758
00:51:38,525 --> 00:51:40,205
At least I have only one face.

759
00:51:40,325 --> 00:51:43,205
What did you mean,
"damage from the inside"?

760
00:51:43,325 --> 00:51:44,645
I have a strategy.

761
00:51:44,765 --> 00:51:46,325
You always have a strategy.

762
00:51:46,445 --> 00:51:47,445
But it's dangerous,

763
00:51:47,525 --> 00:51:49,965
and it can't be shared
without sharing the danger.

764
00:51:50,085 --> 00:51:51,365
You think I'm afraid?

765
00:51:51,485 --> 00:51:54,885
No, but it's only gonna put you
in more danger.

766
00:51:55,005 --> 00:51:58,125
Jessie, before the speeches start,
just go home.

767
00:51:58,245 --> 00:51:59,885
There's gonna be lots of arrests.

768
00:52:00,005 --> 00:52:01,341
You have a mark against your name.

769
00:52:01,365 --> 00:52:03,005
Why?

770
00:52:03,125 --> 00:52:04,325
What's going to happen?

771
00:52:09,605 --> 00:52:10,645
I'm gonna do a good thing.

772
00:52:12,605 --> 00:52:14,365
Whenever I do a good thing,

773
00:52:14,485 --> 00:52:16,525
innocent people get hurt.

774
00:52:16,645 --> 00:52:17,685
So go home.

775
00:52:18,965 --> 00:52:22,245
After this evening, we can meet,
discuss strategy.

776
00:52:22,365 --> 00:52:25,565
That beast out there, he's just a beast.

777
00:52:25,685 --> 00:52:27,485
It's like a horse.

778
00:52:27,605 --> 00:52:30,525
It's the rider that decides
what direction it takes.

779
00:52:32,645 --> 00:52:33,885
And who will be the rider?

780
00:52:35,285 --> 00:52:36,525
Just go home.

781
00:52:46,205 --> 00:52:47,325
Full?

782
00:52:47,445 --> 00:52:49,205
To the fucking brim.

783
00:52:50,685 --> 00:52:51,685
Trouble?

784
00:52:51,725 --> 00:52:53,445
So far, a few communists.

785
00:52:54,605 --> 00:52:57,205
Bullers helped our boys clear them away.

786
00:52:57,325 --> 00:53:00,085
Well, a few hecklers are a good thing.

787
00:53:00,205 --> 00:53:02,605
We can illustrate
how we deal with opposition.

788
00:53:02,725 --> 00:53:06,445
There is a rumour a gang of Jews
are coming up from Digbeth.

789
00:53:06,565 --> 00:53:08,125
No sign of them yet.

790
00:53:08,245 --> 00:53:09,845
Well, let them come.

791
00:53:09,965 --> 00:53:11,565
Welcome them appropriately.

792
00:53:14,885 --> 00:53:16,885
There are a few Peaky boys around.

793
00:53:19,125 --> 00:53:20,365
They are your allies.

794
00:53:20,485 --> 00:53:22,605
There'll be no rifts between us.

795
00:53:22,725 --> 00:53:24,445
Keep your powder dry.

796
00:53:30,485 --> 00:53:32,285
Mr McCavern?

797
00:53:34,565 --> 00:53:36,645
Perish Judah.

798
00:53:36,765 --> 00:53:40,885
No joke, Mr McCavern.

799
00:53:44,965 --> 00:53:45,965
Perish Judah.

800
00:54:46,725 --> 00:54:50,565
You turn the radio on
and turn up the volume.

801
00:54:50,685 --> 00:54:52,405
I want to listen to the news.

802
00:54:55,285 --> 00:54:57,445
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

803
00:54:57,565 --> 00:54:59,925
Mr Oswald Mosley.

804
00:55:32,725 --> 00:55:33,885
Perish Judah!

805
00:55:34,005 --> 00:55:39,005
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!

806
00:55:39,125 --> 00:55:41,965
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!

807
00:55:42,085 --> 00:55:45,565
Perish Judah! Perish Judah! Perish Judah!

808
00:55:45,685 --> 00:55:51,165
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!

809
00:55:51,285 --> 00:55:53,965
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!

810
00:55:54,085 --> 00:55:59,485
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!

811
00:55:59,605 --> 00:56:02,645
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!

812
00:56:02,765 --> 00:56:04,365
Perish Judah!

813
00:56:09,805 --> 00:56:13,325
Welcome, men and women
of Birmingham.

814
00:56:13,445 --> 00:56:17,285
Thank you for coming here
on this cold, dark night,

815
00:56:17,405 --> 00:56:21,085
in spite of the obstruction
and provocation of our enemies.

816
00:56:22,165 --> 00:56:26,485
Our enemies deal in bricks and stones

817
00:56:26,605 --> 00:56:31,485
and bottles. We deal in reasoned
principle, argument and fact.

818
00:56:32,725 --> 00:56:37,285
Among those enemies,
we can number Mr Winston Churchill,

819
00:56:37,405 --> 00:56:42,485
who last night condemned me
in the House as a threat to democracy.

820
00:56:49,325 --> 00:56:51,285
Them's that gone are the lucky ones.

821
00:56:51,405 --> 00:56:52,845
Them's that gone are the lucky ones.

822
00:56:56,885 --> 00:57:01,525
But then Mr Churchill has never been
a friend of the common people.

823
00:57:01,645 --> 00:57:03,885
Faced with the alternative

824
00:57:04,005 --> 00:57:06,485
<i>of saying goodbye to the gold standard,</i>

825
00:57:06,605 --> 00:57:09,085
<i>and therefore to his own employment,</i>

826
00:57:09,205 --> 00:57:12,365
<i>he characteristically selected the latter,</i>

827
00:57:12,485 --> 00:57:13,965
<i>but of course...</i>

828
00:57:14,085 --> 00:57:16,765
<i>...not all attending tonight</i>

829
00:57:16,885 --> 00:57:18,885
<i>will be convinced of our cause.</i>

830
00:57:19,005 --> 00:57:23,605
<i>Some will have come here tonight
to find out for themselves</i>

831
00:57:23,725 --> 00:57:25,845
<i>what we stand for.</i>

832
00:57:25,965 --> 00:57:28,645
Whenever you're ready, Tom.

833
00:57:28,765 --> 00:57:31,725
So here are our guiding principles.

834
00:57:31,845 --> 00:57:35,765
Every citizen shall serve the state.

835
00:57:35,885 --> 00:57:39,365
Not the banks, not factions,

836
00:57:39,485 --> 00:57:41,765
not the Jews!

837
00:57:43,285 --> 00:57:48,285
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!
Perish Judah! Perish Judah!

838
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:52,045
The barriers of class will be abolished

839
00:57:52,165 --> 00:57:53,925
and a greater Britain will be born

840
00:57:54,045 --> 00:57:57,925
of the national socialist
and fascist creed.

841
00:58:09,725 --> 00:58:14,485
It is useless to hide from ourselves
the fact that ever since 1918,

842
00:58:14,605 --> 00:58:17,005
when our heroes returned from France,

843
00:58:17,125 --> 00:58:21,925
our empire has shown all the signs
of disintegration,

844
00:58:22,045 --> 00:58:26,445
and our people are threatened
by gathering disaster.

845
00:58:38,445 --> 00:58:41,445
Get out of my way!

846
00:58:41,565 --> 00:58:42,805
Out of the way!

847
00:58:52,765 --> 00:58:54,285
Go. Go.

848
00:59:15,085 --> 00:59:16,965
Ten.

849
00:59:17,085 --> 00:59:19,405
Nine.

850
00:59:21,445 --> 00:59:23,165
Eight.

851
00:59:25,005 --> 00:59:26,725
Seven.

852
00:59:27,765 --> 00:59:29,525
Six.

853
00:59:31,965 --> 00:59:34,605
Five.

854
00:59:34,725 --> 00:59:36,885
Four.

855
00:59:37,005 --> 00:59:38,645
Three.

856
00:59:38,765 --> 00:59:40,285
Two apple crumble...

857
01:00:53,325 --> 01:00:56,085
I think it's about time
we got off the stage, old man,

858
01:00:56,205 --> 01:00:57,885
until this thing is sorted.

859
01:01:04,965 --> 01:01:08,485
The coppers are here, Arthur.
You gotta get away from the body.

860
01:01:32,605 --> 01:01:34,085
What the fuck are you doing here?

861
01:01:34,205 --> 01:01:35,245
What happened?

862
01:01:35,365 --> 01:01:36,685
I don't know what happened.

863
01:01:36,805 --> 01:01:39,885
I don't know what fucking happened.
It doesn't make any fucking sense.

864
01:01:40,005 --> 01:01:42,485
Wait. Fuck, it's us.

865
01:01:44,205 --> 01:01:47,525
Aberama's dead, he's gone.

866
01:01:47,645 --> 01:01:49,765
He's gone, and they came for me, too.

867
01:01:50,845 --> 01:01:53,365
What the fuck is she doing here?

868
01:01:53,485 --> 01:01:55,205
Arthur, they got to Barney.

869
01:01:55,325 --> 01:01:56,685
They knew everything.

870
01:01:56,805 --> 01:01:58,485
They knew fucking everything.

871
01:01:58,605 --> 01:02:00,805
Who? Who knew, Tom?

872
01:02:00,925 --> 01:02:02,365
Johnny, get this woman out of here.

873
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:03,605
- I want to know.
- Yeah.

874
01:02:03,725 --> 01:02:05,725
Get her out of here. Get her out!

875
01:02:13,285 --> 01:02:14,765
Doesn't make sense.

876
01:02:16,605 --> 01:02:18,045
Doesn't make fucking sense.

877
01:02:19,085 --> 01:02:20,965
Who? Who? Who?

878
01:02:21,085 --> 01:02:24,445
The Chinese, the Italians...

879
01:02:26,125 --> 01:02:29,605
...the Branch, Intelligence,
McCavern, Mosley...

880
01:02:29,725 --> 01:02:32,325
Mosley knew nothing!

881
01:02:32,445 --> 01:02:33,525
He knew nothing!

882
01:02:39,085 --> 01:02:40,765
Who?!

883
01:02:40,885 --> 01:02:42,605
Jesus fucking Christ.

884
01:02:42,725 --> 01:02:45,405
You're fucking frightening me, Tom.

885
01:02:45,525 --> 01:02:46,805
Doesn't make sense.

886
01:02:50,085 --> 01:02:51,445
Who?

887
01:02:52,525 --> 01:02:54,885
Who? Who?

888
01:02:55,005 --> 01:02:56,845
Who?

889
01:02:56,965 --> 01:02:59,605
Who? You know, Tom, you must know.

890
01:03:00,805 --> 01:03:04,365
You're fucking scaring me,
what are you doing?

891
01:03:07,725 --> 01:03:09,765
Talk to me.

892
01:03:09,885 --> 01:03:14,325
Maybe I've found him, Arthur,
the man I can't defeat.

893
01:03:18,125 --> 01:03:20,045
- Mosley?
- I don't know.

894
01:03:20,165 --> 01:03:21,325
I don't fucking know.

895
01:03:23,085 --> 01:03:24,405
Doesn't make sense.

896
01:03:29,285 --> 01:03:30,285
Let's...

897
01:03:31,565 --> 01:03:32,765
Let's go inside.

898
01:03:34,525 --> 01:03:35,765
We'll work it out...

899
01:03:36,845 --> 01:03:38,845
- ...have a drink.
- I need to walk.

900
01:04:22,925 --> 01:04:24,885
The work is all done, Tommy.

901
01:04:25,005 --> 01:04:26,685
It's all done.

902
01:04:26,805 --> 01:04:29,805
We can walk away from all of this.

903
01:04:29,925 --> 01:04:31,525
It's so easy.

904
01:04:31,645 --> 01:04:33,365
It's so soft.

905
01:04:33,485 --> 01:04:35,445
Such a small change.
