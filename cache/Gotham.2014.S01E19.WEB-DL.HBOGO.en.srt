1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,960
I had a meeting
with board of Wayne Enterprises.

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:05,600
To tell them I was
investigating them,

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,600
they sent someone
we trust to spy on us.

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,760
Alfred was stabbed.
It was a friend of his from the Army.

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,000
- What was he looking for?
- Some of my files missing.

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,040
I could find out who hired him.
He's the key to everything.

8
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,160
I have a plan.

9
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,360
I promise you,

10
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,600
I will get some of us
out of here alive.

11
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,680
- Who are you?
- Dr. Francis Dulmacher.

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,120
The people in the basement trust me.

13
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,800
Put me in charge and I promise you
a dependable flow of healthy product.

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,000
- And if I fail?
- Those who fail me

15
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,040
still have their uses.

16
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,120
What are they doing?

17
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,320
I'm sorry, honey, you're on the list.

18
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,800
Half the cops on the G.C.P.D.
have a Cobblepot

19
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,360
and Loeb has the goods on
all of them.

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,720
That is what Loeb does.

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,000
- Well, it ends now.
- So, what do you want?

22
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,080
With the coming election

23
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,920
for president
of the policeman's union

24
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,040
there's no man I'd rather support.

25
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,360
It's a new day in the G.C.P.D.

26
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,680
- Looking good, Ms. Cavanaugh.
- Thank you.

27
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,440
- How's that swelling?
- Fine.

28
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,840
If you need more ice packs,
I'll let Denise know.

29
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,160
Mr. Douglas,
I know you don't like your view

30
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,080
and as soon as
a recovery suite is open

31
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,720
I'm going to move you.

32
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,080
Is there a problem?

33
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,720
- You're outside.
- You're observant.

34
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,120
I'm the new assistant for the doctor.
I'm Fish.

35
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,480
And you are?

36
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,040
Inside, you're free to roam,
that's Dr. Dulmacher's prerogative.

37
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,560
But once you step outside,
you're in my world.

38
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,600
I'm the man who catches
the poor souls

39
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,760
brave enough to try to escape.

40
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,320
You're the catcher.

41
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,840
I've heard a lot about you.

42
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,840
So, have there been many?

43
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,400
Poor souls, I mean.

44
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,480
No.

45
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,200
The water does most of the work.

46
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,280
But every so often, someone gets
stupid and gives it a go.

47
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,760
I didn't know
I wasn't supposed to be outside.

48
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,880
My mistake.

49
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,360
Make that mistake again

50
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,720
and it'll be your last.

51
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,440
I saw the papers the other day.

52
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,840
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

53
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,680
So, what does president
of the policeman's union do exactly?

54
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,960
Depends on the president.

55
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,600
- I see.
- How's Alfred?

56
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,080
Whinier than I thought.

57
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,040
No, he's getting better.

58
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,480
Glad to hear it.

59
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,000
You two lied about who stabbed him,
didn't you?

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,480
That's why you're here?

61
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,560
Is it?

62
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,640
Yes.

63
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,080
Did you...

64
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,880
lie to me?

65
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,520
No.

66
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,200
If we don't have a description
of the culprit

67
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,400
we won't find him.

68
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,280
I wish I could help you, detective.

69
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,280
Alfred wants to go after him

70
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,720
on his own,
that's why you lied to me.

71
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,320
No.

72
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,680
Bruce, look at me.

73
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,120
Whatever Alfred is up to,
you have to stay out of it.

74
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,680
It's dangerous.

75
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,680
And it's not your fight.

76
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,600
I cut this bread way too thick,
didn't I?

77
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,680
Bruce...

78
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,920
I understand what you're saying.

79
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,280
Okay, then.

80
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,520
Detective Gordon.

81
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,400
Len Moore.

82
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,360
- Officer. What can I help you with?
- You're a man with a reputation.

83
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,920
- Yeah?
- A Gotham detective

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,200
who actually closes cases.

85
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,640
I try.

86
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,120
That's actually why I'm here.

87
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,600
- Yeah?
- See a few weeks ago

88
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,160
I was the first responder
to a homicide.

89
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,720
Victim's name was 'Grace Fairchild'.

90
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,800
They found her body stabbed
to death.

91
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,560
The detectives who caught the case

92
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,520
they got nowhere with it
and moved on.

93
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,840
I'm sorry to hear that

94
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,720
- but it happens.
- I'm wondering if you'd pick up

95
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,080
where they left off.

96
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,920
You want me to take over the case?

97
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,400
Yeah.

98
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,880
Look, Len, I got a full boat here.

99
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,200
This victim's family,
they deserve justice.

100
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,480
- Yeah.
- Her killer deserves to pay

101
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,240
for what he did.

102
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,480
This was a nasty one.

103
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,920
They're all nasty.
What's your angle on this?

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,400
There's no angle. It's just...

105
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,240
A few of us younger guys,

106
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,240
and we've been watching
what you've been doing

107
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,160
to clean up Gotham and the G.C.P.D.,
and I wanna be a part of it.

108
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,360
And bringing you this case...

109
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,280
is my way of trying to do that.

110
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,720
I'll look into it.

111
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,440
Ready to go?

112
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,760
Ready?

113
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,600
I have been dreaming
about the carbonara

114
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,200
at Luccio's all day.

115
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,080
New case?

116
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,520
Sort of. It's an unsolved homicide
a uni asked me to look into.

117
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,880
- It's an odd one.
- How so?

118
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,000
Thought you were hungry.

119
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,280
What can I say?

120
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,720
You had me at "homicide."

121
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,680
The victim, Grace Fairchild,
was found two weeks ago.

122
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,920
But she was reported missing
four months earlier.

123
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,280
The last anyone heard,
she called her mother

124
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,440
said she was having a drink at a bar
in the South Village.

125
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,800
That's my neighborhood. What bar?

126
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,280
Detectives canvassed the area,
nobody knows.

127
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,480
No leads, no tips.

128
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,240
I'm starting to see
why the case was dropped.

129
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,680
God, we were almost the same age.

130
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,200
We could've been friends.

131
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,800
You know, they have a few
speakeasies in the South Village.

132
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,880
It's a new thing.

133
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,640
You walk in through a dry cleaner's
or a shoe store to get inside.

134
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,720
Easy to miss
if you're not in the know.

135
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Thanks. I'll check it out.

136
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,000
Good.

137
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,480
I'm glad you're looking into this.

138
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,760
Whoever did this, he's a monster.

139
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,760
Kelly.

140
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,520
God.

141
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,240
Still bad.

142
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,760
What do you want?

143
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,600
I have a plan, but I need your help.

144
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,880
What plan?

145
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,160
We're going to escape.

146
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,160
I'm getting off of this hell
of an island

147
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,880
or I'm gonna die trying.

148
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,760
{\an5}Alfred?

149
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,920
{\an5}Where are you going?

150
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
{\an5}Into the city, Master Bruce.

151
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,800
{\an5}If I know Reggie,
he's probably drunk himself

152
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,200
{\an5}half to death by now

153
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,320
{\an5}and is moving swiftly
onto the harder stuff.

154
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,040
{\an5}I'll probably find him

155
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,720
{\an5}holed up in a shooting gallery,
totally off his maracas.

156
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,680
{\an5}Alfred, you can't go.

157
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,520
- You're not well.
- No choice, Master Bruce.

158
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,080
{\an5}He'll only be here for a few days.

159
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,280
{\an5}Enough time to get his fix,
then he'll be off.

160
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,520
{\an5}Well, then we'd better get going.

161
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,920
If you think I'm gonna take you,
Master...

162
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,840
Oh, dear.

163
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,680
{\an5}Good day, Lidia.

164
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,800
{\an5}Have you thought about my offer?

165
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,280
{\an5}I told you already,
my place is not for sale.

166
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,960
{\an5}Please.

167
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,480
{\an5}I beg of you, think again.

168
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,560
{\an5}I will serve strictly
as a silent partner.

169
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:35,600
{\an5}You will continue
to run the day-to-day operations...

170
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,000
I told you already!

171
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,880
Madam, please, I meant no harm.

172
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,000
Okay, ma'am. You made your point.

173
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,080
Madam, I assure you...

174
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,840
{\an5}I have a sincere interest
in your establishment.

175
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,680
{\an5}If money is not what you seek...

176
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,840
{\an5}surely there is something you want.

177
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,840
{\an5}My granddaughter, Antonia...

178
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,160
{\an5}She's beautiful...

179
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,520
{\an5}Virtuous...

180
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,960
{\an5}An angel.

181
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:12,040
{\an5}And she has been seduced
by a silver-tongued guitar player.

182
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,480
Lucifer himself.

183
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,480
A tragedy.

184
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,720
{\an5}You make her come home...

185
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,800
{\an5}leave this baboon...

186
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,640
then I'll consider your offer.

187
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,720
Madam...

188
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,720
She'll be home for Sunday Mass.

189
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,440
You have my word.

190
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,760
This place is a dump.
Real nickel-and-dime.

191
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,800
It's worth far more than that, Gabe.

192
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,320
You just don't see it yet.

193
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,400
- No.
- I'm not saying

194
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,280
we officially take over
the investigation.

195
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,360
Just help me look into it.

196
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,760
No.

197
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,120
Harvey, the victim deserves justice.

198
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,320
Yeah,
and I deserve a mute supermodel

199
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,840
who likes pasty Irish guys
and loves to cook.

200
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,040
It's not happening.
Besides, we both know that justice

201
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,160
isn't the real reason
you want this one.

202
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,440
Hello, detectives.

203
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,480
Ed, question.

204
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,800
Would you rather work more or less?

205
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,440
- Is this a riddle?
- Exactly.

206
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,800
You're helping. What's up?

207
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,000
List of establishments
in the South Village

208
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,120
with a liquor license.

209
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,200
- Including speakeasies?
- Yes, sirree.

210
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,280
Four of which,
you'll be pleased to know,

211
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,960
were missed
by the original detectives.

212
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,720
That's great, Ed.
Thanks. One more thing.

213
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,240
I was going through
the crime scene evidence

214
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,880
from the Fairchild murder and...

215
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,320
there's a piece of evidence missing.

216
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,920
- Any idea what it is?
- No, but it's labeled "3A."

217
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Think you can find it?

218
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,360
Detective, I will solve this puzzle.

219
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,120
You coming?

220
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,120
Let me say it in Spanish. No.

221
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,520
Okay, look, you're right.
I'm ambitious.

222
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,800
I wanna show people around here
that things are gonna change.

223
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,920
But, Harvey,
I can't do that without your help.

224
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,320
Look, I know you're riding high

225
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,600
with getting over on
Loeb and all

226
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,480
but there's one thing
you should always remember.

227
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,680
Fly too close to the sun,
you're gonna get burned.

228
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,360
- You done?
- Yeah.

229
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,920
Good. Then get your ass up.

230
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,080
<i>So that's it.</i>

231
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,120
So you're trying to tell me

232
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,120
you actually think
we can get out of here?

233
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,200
That's what I said, didn't I?

234
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,360
- How?
- With cunning and guile.

235
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,240
But it won't work without your help.

236
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,240
Why us?

237
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,920
Why not your friends?

238
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,840
There's no telling
how this is all going to go down

239
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,240
during the breakout.

240
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,480
Just in case it goes south.

241
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,120
I need some stone-cold killers

242
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,560
by my side
not some whipped-ass victims.

243
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,960
That's fair. What's the plan?

244
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,640
Outside, there's a boat
down by the shore

245
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,720
big enough to carry the six of us
off of this island.

246
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,800
A boat?

247
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,880
You have a better idea?

248
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,120
I heard a chopper land the other day.

249
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,600
Thumped like a son of a bitch.

250
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,760
Why don't we fly out of here?

251
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,760
Do any of you know how to fly
a helicopter?

252
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,760
That's why.

253
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,560
All right, this boat.

254
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,640
You got the keys to it?

255
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,120
No. Not yet, but I will.

256
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,680
So, are you in or out?

257
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,120
We're 0-3 and
my dogs are barking.

258
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,560
I'm hardly one to complain
about going to a bar,

259
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,200
but this is getting ridiculous.

260
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,200
It's grunt work.
Just like any other case.

261
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:47,040
Except it's not just like
any other case, it's a hobby.

262
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,640
Everybody needs a hobby.

263
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,960
G.C.P.D. Homicide.

264
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,120
Yeah, she was in here.

265
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,240
A while ago,
maybe three or four months.

266
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,480
You remember her?

267
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,520
Yeah, she mentioned
she went to a rival college of mine.

268
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,080
- Plus...
- Plus what?

269
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,440
To be honest with you,
her date was hot.

270
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,920
Her date,
remember what he looked like?

271
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,560
Just that he was good-looking,
but classy, you know?

272
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,880
Okay, your turn.

273
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,800
How is a successful, funny,

274
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,960
mildly good-looking guy like you
still single?

275
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,400
Mildly?

276
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,800
Maybe a little bit more than that.
Come on.

277
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,400
Something has to be wrong with you.

278
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,080
Maybe you're right.
I've had plenty of relationships

279
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,480
but in the end they...

280
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,040
never seem to work out.

281
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,120
Why not?

282
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,680
I think what I'm looking for
frightens people.

283
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,760
Okay.

284
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,520
No, it's, it's nothing weird.

285
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,680
What, then?

286
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,280
It's gonna sound cheesy.

287
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,920
I won't laugh. I promise.

288
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,040
What I'm looking for...

289
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,640
is unconditional love.

290
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,800
Unconditional, real,

291
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,440
intense love.

292
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,480
Cheesy, right?

293
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,560
Totally.

294
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,200
You like it?

295
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:44,000
It'll do.

296
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,840
There's some wine in the kitchen.

297
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,920
Open anything you like.

298
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
May I take your jacket?

299
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,320
This place must work well.

300
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,200
What do you mean?

301
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,080
The women that you bring back here.

302
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,120
Actually it's...

303
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,440
Been a while,
since I've had anyone over.

304
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,760
Lucky me.

305
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm the lucky one.

306
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:25,320
Thank you for taking a chance on me.

307
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,760
Are you kidding me?

308
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,600
Look at this place.

309
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,720
I could definitely stay here.

310
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,800
For a night.

311
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,800
Look, if he...

312
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,440
Comes back in or you think
of anything else, give me a call.

313
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,120
Sure.

314
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,840
He was right here, Harvey.

315
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,920
Yeah.

316
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,200
You're not dropping this one,
are you?

317
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,240
Not a chance.

318
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,840
So...

319
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,840
Are we in agreement?

320
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,400
Not quite.

321
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,520
<i>Pagliacci</i>says
he still loves the girl.

322
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,600
He won't leave her.

323
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,240
Antonia and I are destined
to be together.

324
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,560
And nothing you can do

325
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,480
will make me stop loving her.

326
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,040
See what I mean? True love.

327
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,120
You want me to put a slug in him?

328
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,080
- See if that loosens him up?
- No.

329
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,280
He's a guitar player.

330
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,080
Lose the fingers.

331
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:24,320
- You want me to shoot his fingers?
- Don't shoot them.

332
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,400
Lose them.

333
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,760
Just the man I wanted to see.

334
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,320
Don't say that.

335
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,560
You're gonna make Jim jealous.

336
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,880
I finished the Fairchild autopsy
and the results are strange.

337
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,400
Strange how?

338
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,160
Grace Fairchild was missing
for over four months.

339
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,520
Usually with these kind
of abductions there's a lot of...

340
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,320
trauma and abuse to the body,
not this time.

341
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,320
Other than the stab wounds
to her heart and her throat,

342
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,920
her body was mostly pristine.

343
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,920
That doesn't add up.

344
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,360
Unless...

345
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,360
- Unless what?
- Have you ever consider

346
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,600
if she ran off on her own?

347
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,440
That her going missing has
nothing to do with her murder?

348
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,520
The findings would certainly
support that.

349
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,520
Maybe.

350
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,040
No.

351
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:30,040
No. Fairchild had a good job,
a mortgage.

352
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:33,000
Hell, she called her mother
the night she went missing.

353
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,600
No, she didn't run away.
She was taken.

354
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,160
And whoever took her
kept her locked away

355
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,000
'til he was good and ready.

356
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,440
And then he killed her.

357
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:48,840
I know it.

358
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,760
Morning. How'd you sleep?

359
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,400
Like a baby.

360
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,440
So, I thought after breakfast,
we could go to the Palick exhibit.

361
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,960
He's only in town another week.

362
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,520
I would love to, really,
but I am already late

363
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,280
and I've got a morning meeting
and a work lunch.

364
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,320
- So reschedule it.
- I can't.

365
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,760
I had a really good time
with you last night.

366
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,600
And I hope that
I get to see you again.

367
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:34,040
At least have some breakfast.

368
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,400
I still have to go home and change,
and I'm so late.

369
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,480
Next time.

370
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,640
Call me tonight.

371
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,880
I can come over after work.

372
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,040
If you want.

373
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,720
Jason, please. I really have to go.

374
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,440
No.

375
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,720
You don't.

376
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,320
Ms. Mooney.

377
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,880
What a surprise.

378
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,520
Is there something I can do for you?

379
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,360
Well,

380
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,800
supplies were running low
for the inmates.

381
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,560
Those are in the storage room.

382
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,720
But then, of course,
you already knew that.

383
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:54,400
The one thing
I won't tolerate is dishonesty.

384
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,640
You were trying to escape,
weren't you?

385
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,720
No.

386
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,920
I'll tell you what

387
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,080
I'm gonna shoot you in the stomach.

388
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,040
You'll feel pressure at first.

389
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,280
Then you'll feel an intense burning
like you've never felt in your life.

390
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,920
Maybe that will properly motivate you
to be honest with me.

391
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,640
I ask you again.
Were you trying to escape?

392
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,520
- No.
- How disappointing.

393
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,560
Wait. Stop. Wait, wait.

394
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,600
I was lying,
but I wasn't trying to escape.

395
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,520
You were going to kill me?

396
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,080
Slit my throat, perhaps?

397
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,040
No, I swear.

398
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,240
Not yours.

399
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,320
Not yours.

400
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:52,400
Every night when I close my eyes,
I pray to God...

401
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,240
that nightmare doesn't come.

402
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,240
That...

403
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,960
living, breathing man
stitched together with...

404
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,120
arms and legs that weren't his.

405
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,680
That nightmare you created...

406
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,080
I've faced dangerous men

407
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,240
but none like you.

408
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,240
Dollmaker.

409
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,960
So, you'd rather take your own life
than end up one of my creations?

410
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,040
Yes.

411
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,120
Well,

412
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,720
Miss Mooney.

413
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,120
Try anything like this again
and your nightmare will come true.

414
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,960
I will bring you back
from the dead if I have to.

415
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,960
And make you into something
the world has never seen.

416
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,880
Was there something else?

417
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,320
No.

418
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,280
I could've smashed your head
with a brick, you know.

419
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,040
Why would you do that?

420
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,240
Why'd you even say that?

421
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,720
Just thought you should know.

422
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,480
What's up?
Why are you looking for me?

423
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,920
Reggie Payne,

424
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,240
the man who stabbed Alfred,
he's in Gotham.

425
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,200
And you need my help to find him.
Okay.

426
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,600
Alfred said he'd be at a gun range
for a few days.

427
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,120
But I checked every one in the city.
Nothing.

428
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,160
Who stays at a gun range
for a few days?

429
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,000
Doesn't make any sense.

430
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,920
That's what he said.

431
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,040
He said Reggie would be
at a shooting gallery.

432
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,280
That's not the same as
a gun range, silly.

433
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,200
You really need to get out more.

434
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,520
All right, all right, all right.

435
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,680
Now, go get yourself cleaned up.

436
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,120
I'll be back in a minute.

437
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,320
So...

438
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,160
Shall we discuss terms?

439
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,880
- So, what is it?
- Well, to be clear.

440
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,880
This isn't an actual piece of crime
scene evidence.

441
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,400
It's gone, as far as I can tell.

442
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,960
What I was able to find
is a photocopy buried

443
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,320
deep in a logbook.

444
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,640
It's a broken heart.
Hand-painted, I guess.

445
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,720
This was at the crime scene?

446
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,000
- You sure?
- Well, not this, exactly.

447
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,680
You see, a photocopy is a replica...

448
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,800
Damn it, no, Ed. Not now.

449
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,760
- What's wrong?
- I warned you

450
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,640
but, no.

451
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,280
You had to go
and get both of us burned.

452
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,960
- What are you talking about?
- This guy you're after.

453
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,360
This is not his first rodeo.

454
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,960
He's a serial killer.

455
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,760
This looks delicious.

456
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,120
Thank you.

457
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,040
I...

458
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:23,680
I think I might have overcooked
the lamb a little bit.

459
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,120
But I... I...

460
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,200
I'm sure it's fine.

461
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:30,120
How was your day?

462
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,560
Wonderful...

463
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,640
Darling.

464
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,320
And how was yours?

465
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,040
Good.

466
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,560
Thank you for asking.

467
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,920
I think you might have been right.

468
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,080
About the lamb.

469
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,880
I am so sorry.

470
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
It's fine.

471
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,960
I checked it twice
when it was in the oven

472
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:20,400
and I think it might be hotter
than it says that it is.

473
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,400
You know.

474
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:34,000
I don't think this is working out.

475
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,720
It's not you.

476
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,680
It's me.

477
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,080
We could've had something special.

478
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,560
Please. Please, don't hurt me.

479
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,600
You know,
I really thought you were the one.

480
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,480
Please.

481
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:20,160
Don't worry, sooner or later.

482
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,240
I'll find her.

483
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,160
I still don't get it.

484
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,760
Why all that trouble
for this pile of bricks?

485
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,040
This was never about money, Gabe.

486
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,240
Not about money? What else is there?

487
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,000
All kinds of things motivate people.

488
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,880
Lust, ambition, envy.

489
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,800
Okay, what motivated you?

490
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,200
Why do you want this place so bad?

491
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,280
It's simple.

492
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,200
This is where,
I'm gonna kill Don Maroni.

493
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,360
It's time. Are you ready?

494
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,440
Let's go.

495
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,480
Now, as soon as this door opens,

496
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,120
an alarm will go off
and we will not have much time.

497
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,720
- What about the gate?
- Unlocked last night.

498
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,240
Take these.
Get the boat started as soon as

499
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,160
- you get there.
- You're not coming?

500
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,680
I'm coming. I'll be right back.
I need to get Kelly.

501
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,600
He can barely walk. Let's go.

502
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,800
Call me sentimental,
but I cannot leave him here.

503
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,000
And you better not leave me.

504
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,280
You lied to me, Fish.

505
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,040
I warned you what would happen
if you lied to me.

506
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,200
What wonders I'm going to make
of your parts.

507
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,600
See you around, doc.

508
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,800
Leave him there.

509
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,560
We don't have much time. Let's go.

510
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,640
Go.

511
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,680
This way.

512
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,720
They're headed for the boat.

513
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,360
What are you doing, man?
Open up the gate.

514
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,480
I can't. It's locked.

515
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,680
What? Fish said she unlocked it.

516
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,360
- That bitch.
- What?

517
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,000
Fish.

518
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:29,520
She set us up.

519
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,120
- Kelly, other side.
- Over here, come on.

520
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,040
- Hurry, hurry.
- Come on.

521
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,960
You told them you couldn't fly,
didn't you?

522
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,400
I lied.

523
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,000
The chopper.

524
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:14,920
Hold on.

525
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,640
Fish.

526
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,800
He abducts young, single,
attractive women

527
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,840
and he keeps them
sometimes for a week,

528
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,200
sometimes for months.

529
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,840
Then he dumps
their bodies around Gotham.

530
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,520
- How many has he killed?
- A dozen. Maybe more.

531
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,920
Every time he makes a kill,
he leaves one of these

532
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
at the crime scene.
It's his calling card.

533
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,360
So, who is he?

534
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,480
No one knows.

535
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,560
Thinking is he's educated,
decent-looking, rich,

536
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,680
but that's just a profile.

537
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,600
Some of the guys call him
the Don Juan Killer.

538
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,720
Most call him the Ogre.

539
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,120
So, why haven't I heard
about this guy before?

540
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,600
Why hasn't the public?

541
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,360
- It's the G.C.P.D.'s...
- Hey, fellas.

542
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,120
Dirty little secret.

543
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,760
Only a handful of senior detectives
know anything about this guy.

544
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,560
And they sure ain't leaking it
to the press.

545
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,760
Why not?

546
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:37,200
Because the Ogre retaliates
against any cop who investigates him.

547
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,080
He kills the people they love.

548
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,480
That's why this lunatic
hasn't been caught yet, Jim

549
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,960
because no one's been stupid enough
to investigate.

550
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,160
Until I came along.

551
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,760
Which makes me wonder,
how did you catch this?

552
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,440
I told you, a fellow officer asked me
to look into it.

553
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,080
Who?

554
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,160
Which one?

555
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,840
Okay.

556
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,800
- <i>Other side.</i>
- That's him.

557
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,120
<i>Give me some of that stuff.</i>

558
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,360
Relax, old man.
We're not gonna rob you.

559
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,200
- What are you doing here?
- We came to talk to you.

560
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,560
- Who's she?
- Never mind.

561
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,560
Who sent you to my house?

562
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,000
Who sent me to...

563
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,480
Just go home. Go home, Bruce.

564
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,720
You'll be in more trouble
than you are already.

565
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:05,160
Hey! That's my medicine.
Give me that.

566
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,160
My friend just asked you a question.

567
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,560
I said, give me that.

568
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,680
Or you'll what?

569
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,360
- Hey! Don't!
- Answer the question.

570
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,200
Listen, I didn't mean any harm.

571
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,960
I just was to take some documents.

572
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,520
But Alfred walked in...

573
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,240
is he all right?

574
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,760
Is he?

575
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,040
You stabbed him.

576
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,240
What do you care?

577
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,800
I care. He's all right, isn't he?

578
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,320
Who sent you?

579
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,960
Throw them out.

580
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,280
- No!
- Tell me who sent you.

581
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,480
Who sent you?

582
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,040
You shouldn't be doing this, Bruce.

583
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,240
Only Alfie can deal
with these people.

584
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,760
What people?

585
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,920
It's a woman named Mathis,

586
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,400
and a guy called Bunderslaw.

587
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,360
Sid Bunderslaw.
He's the guy I dealt with.

588
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,520
But you've go...

589
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,040
You've got to let
Alfie take care of this.

590
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:25,040
Not you, Bruce.
It's no business for a child.

591
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,560
This man, Bunderslaw.

592
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,840
What did he want?

593
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,200
Just to know what you knew.

594
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:35,680
To see how far your investigation
had gone.

595
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,360
But he was scared.

596
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,440
And that's why he sent me.

597
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,320
Now, can I have my bag back, please?

598
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,760
Please?

599
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,240
Give it back to him.

600
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,920
You.

601
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,920
You're a sick man, Mr. Payne.

602
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,920
You need help.

603
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,880
Don't you patronize me.

604
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,680
I may have vices, yeah,
but I'm a professional.

605
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:26,760
You want me to tell Bunderslaw
that you're onto him?

606
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,400
Because he'll come after you.

607
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:33,560
And there's nothing that you can do
to stop him.

608
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,160
You're just silly little children.

609
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,440
I'm going to tell on you.

610
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,880
No, you won't.

611
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,640
It wa... it wasn't my idea. I swear.

612
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,480
I was ordered to get you
to take the case.

613
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,360
- Ordered by who?
- Loeb.

614
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,520
It was Commissioner Loeb.

615
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,400
He told me to tell you that...

616
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,960
I looked up to you,
that you inspired me.

617
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,960
I mean, he told me to say that
I wanted to help clean up Gotham

618
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,920
and the G.C.P.D,

619
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,160
and that this case...

620
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,840
this case was part of that.

621
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,080
He knew you couldn't say no.

622
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,680
So you followed orders
like a good soldier.

623
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,240
I didn't have a choice.

624
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,560
I mean, you know what Loeb can do.

625
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:21,920
All too well.

626
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,640
Jim, listen,
you're still in the clear on this.

627
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,960
In the clear?
He could come after Lee.

628
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,520
Only if he thinks
you're investigating him.

629
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,160
Think about it.

630
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,600
It's not on your docket.

631
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,280
There's been no press
linking you to this case.

632
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,240
All we've done is ask questions,
so you gotta drop it now.

633
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,080
This is no time to be a hero.

634
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,800
If I drop it,
I'm letting a serial killer go free.

635
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,720
The blood of his next victim
is on my hands.

636
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,520
If you don't drop it,
that blood could be Lee's.

637
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,840
<i>Hi, you've reached Lee.
Go ahead and leave a message.</i>

638
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,400
Lee, call me as soon as you can.
It's very important.

639
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,360
You!

640
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,200
- You son of a bitch.
- Excuse me?

641
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,320
You set me up.

642
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,680
- Detective, I don't know what...
- Don't talk.

643
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,600
- Listen. Back off.
- Hey.

644
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,680
Don't you...

645
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,360
I tried to work with you.

646
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,640
But now you crossed a line.

647
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,600
You come after the one I love?

648
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,480
From here on, we're playing my way.

649
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,360
