1
00:03:00,025 --> 00:03:02,116
It's the sense of touch.

2
00:03:03,658 --> 00:03:04,749
What?

3
00:03:07,092 --> 00:03:10,956
Any real city, you walk,
you know?

4
00:03:11,059 --> 00:03:14,889
You brush past people.
People bump into you.

5
00:03:14,992 --> 00:03:17,981
In L.A., nobody touches you.

6
00:03:20,725 --> 00:03:23,987
We're always behind
this metal and glass.

7
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:28,357
I think we miss
that touch so much

8
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:32,413
that we crash into each other
just so we can feel something.

9
00:03:34,425 --> 00:03:36,618
You guys okay?

10
00:03:36,725 --> 00:03:39,748
I think he hit his head.

11
00:03:39,858 --> 00:03:41,687
You don't think that's true?

12
00:03:41,792 --> 00:03:43,690
Stay in your car.

13
00:03:43,792 --> 00:03:46,587
Graham, I think
we got rear-ended.

14
00:03:46,692 --> 00:03:48,749
I think we spun around twice.

15
00:03:48,858 --> 00:03:53,813
And somewhere in there, one of us lost
our frame of reference.

16
00:03:53,925 --> 00:03:56,323
And I'm gonna go look for it.

17
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:01,154
- Calm down, ma'am.
- I am calm!

18
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:03,191
I need to see your registration
and insurance.

19
00:04:03,292 --> 00:04:05,281
Why? It's not my fault! It's her fault!

20
00:04:05,391 --> 00:04:07,085
- She do this!
- My fault?

21
00:04:07,192 --> 00:04:09,249
Ma'am, you really need
to wait in your vehicle.

22
00:04:09,358 --> 00:04:11,257
- My fault?
- Stop in middle of street!

23
00:04:11,358 --> 00:04:13,018
Mexicans no know how to drive.

24
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:17,819
- She "blake" too fast.
- I "blake" too fast? I "blake" too fast.

25
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:21,618
- I'm sorry you no see my "blake" lights.
- Ma'am.

26
00:04:21,725 --> 00:04:24,520
See, I stop when I see a long line of cars
stopped in front of me.

27
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:27,455
Maybe you see over
steering wheel, you "blake" too!

28
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:31,082
- Ma'am!
- I call immigration. Look what you do my car.

29
00:04:31,192 --> 00:04:32,912
Officer, can you please
write in your report

30
00:04:32,992 --> 00:04:34,958
how shocked I am to be hit
by an Asian driver!

31
00:04:35,059 --> 00:04:38,253
- Ma'am!
- Ma'am, no. See, Detective...

32
00:04:43,092 --> 00:04:46,455
All right. You've got
to calm down.

33
00:04:54,092 --> 00:04:58,184
- Hey, Detective! Nice entrance.
- Fuck you.

34
00:05:01,292 --> 00:05:05,587
- Hey, you okay?
- I'm freezin'

35
00:05:05,692 --> 00:05:08,453
Shit. I heard
it might snow.

36
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,922
- Get outta here.
- That's what I heard.

37
00:05:11,025 --> 00:05:13,786
- You got a smoke?
- Nah. I quit.

38
00:05:13,892 --> 00:05:16,517
Yeah, me too.

39
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:19,114
- What do you got?
- Dead kid.

40
00:05:28,592 --> 00:05:30,387
Hey, Bob.

41
00:06:12,792 --> 00:06:15,553
You get one free box of ammunition.
What kind do you want?

42
00:06:28,858 --> 00:06:31,323
Yo, Osama! Plan a jihad
on your own time.

43
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:34,017
What do you want?

44
00:06:37,192 --> 00:06:39,953
- Are you making insult at me?
- Am I making insult "at" you?

45
00:06:40,059 --> 00:06:43,434
- Is that the closest you can come to English?
- Yes, I speak English! I am American citizen.

46
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:45,890
- Oh, God, here we go.
- I have right like you.

47
00:06:45,992 --> 00:06:48,068
- I have right to buy gun.
- Not in my store, you don't!

48
00:06:48,092 --> 00:06:50,183
- Andy, get him outta here now!
- Go wait in the car.

49
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:51,291
Now. Get out!

50
00:06:52,592 --> 00:06:55,990
- You're an ignorant man!
- I'm ignorant? You're liberating my country

51
00:06:56,092 --> 00:06:59,149
and I'm flying 747 s into your mud huts
and incinerating your friends?

52
00:06:59,258 --> 00:07:02,247
- Get the fuck out!
- No, you get the fuck out!

53
00:07:02,358 --> 00:07:04,018
No, don't touch me!
He cheat me!

54
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,023
- Andy, now!
- Let's go.

55
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,613
Okay.

56
00:07:11,258 --> 00:07:14,157
You can give me the gun
or give me back the money.

57
00:07:14,258 --> 00:07:16,554
And I am really hoping
for the money.

58
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,616
- What kind of ammunition do you want?
- Whatever fits.

59
00:07:24,725 --> 00:07:26,691
We got a lot of kinds.

60
00:07:26,792 --> 00:07:29,155
We got long colts,
short colts, bull heads,

61
00:07:29,258 --> 00:07:31,816
flat nose, hollow points,
wide cutters,

62
00:07:31,925 --> 00:07:35,357
and a dozen more that'll fit
any size hole.

63
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:39,220
Just depends upon how
much bang you can handle.

64
00:07:41,158 --> 00:07:43,420
I'll take the ones
in the red box.

65
00:07:46,592 --> 00:07:49,251
- You know what those are?
- Can I have them?

66
00:07:58,558 --> 00:08:03,048
Did you see any white people waitin' an hour
and 32 minutes for a plate of spaghetti?

67
00:08:03,158 --> 00:08:05,091
And how many cups of coffee
did we get?

68
00:08:05,191 --> 00:08:08,056
You don't drink coffee!
And I didn't want any.

69
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:11,921
Man, that woman poured cup after cup
to every single white person around us.

70
00:08:12,025 --> 00:08:15,082
But did she even ask you
if you wanted any?

71
00:08:15,191 --> 00:08:17,234
We didn't get any coffee that
you didn't want and I didn't order,

72
00:08:17,258 --> 00:08:19,486
and that's evidence
of racial discrimination?

73
00:08:19,592 --> 00:08:21,581
Did you notice
that our waitress was black?

74
00:08:21,692 --> 00:08:24,157
And black women don't think
in stereotypes?

75
00:08:24,258 --> 00:08:26,224
You tell me. When was
the last time you met one

76
00:08:26,325 --> 00:08:28,689
who didn't think she knew
everything about your lazy ass

77
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:31,020
before you even opened
your mouth, huh?

78
00:08:31,124 --> 00:08:33,454
That waitress sized us up
in two seconds.

79
00:08:33,558 --> 00:08:37,251
We're black, and black people don't tip.
She wasn't gonna waste her time.

80
00:08:37,358 --> 00:08:40,347
Somebody like that? Nothing you can do
to change their mind.

81
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,890
How much did you leave?

82
00:08:42,992 --> 00:08:44,958
You expect me to pay
for that kind of service?

83
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:49,457
What? What the fuck
is you laughin' at, man?

84
00:08:49,558 --> 00:08:52,524
I'm seriously starting to think that
you're jealous of Karen.

85
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:56,819
Hardly. I'd just like to see you get through
a meal without calling her or anyone else.

86
00:08:56,925 --> 00:09:01,448
Okay, no more phone calls. As a
matter of fact, you can hold the battery.

87
00:09:01,558 --> 00:09:03,387
Okay?

88
00:09:04,858 --> 00:09:07,187
Ten bucks says
she calls you in the car.

89
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,985
Wait, wait, wait.
See what that woman just did?

90
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,148
- You see that?
- She's cold.

91
00:09:12,258 --> 00:09:15,554
She got colder
as soon as she saw us.

92
00:09:15,658 --> 00:09:18,783
- Ah, come on, don't start.
- Man, look around you, man.

93
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:22,346
You couldn't find a whiter, safer or
better-lit part of this city right now.

94
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,356
But yet this white woman
sees two black guys

95
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:27,151
who look like UCLA students
strolling down the sidewalk,

96
00:09:27,258 --> 00:09:29,690
and her reaction is blind fear?

97
00:09:29,792 --> 00:09:32,280
Look at us, dog. Are we dressed
like gangbangers?

98
00:09:32,391 --> 00:09:35,721
Huh? No.
Do we look threatening? No.

99
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:39,723
Fact. If anybody should be
scared around here, it's us!

100
00:09:39,825 --> 00:09:43,780
We're the only two black faces surrounded
by a sea of over-caffeinated white people

101
00:09:43,892 --> 00:09:46,585
patrolled by
the trigger-happy L.A.P.D.

102
00:09:46,692 --> 00:09:50,249
So you tell me.
Why aren't we scared?

103
00:09:50,358 --> 00:09:52,551
'Cause we got guns?

104
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:54,453
You could be right.

105
00:09:57,525 --> 00:09:59,753
- Get the fuck outta the car!
- Gimme the keys!

106
00:09:59,858 --> 00:10:02,585
- Hurry up! Get down!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

107
00:10:02,692 --> 00:10:06,920
- No, no! Please!
- Don't look at me! Turn around!

108
00:10:07,024 --> 00:10:10,548
- Come on! Go!
- We're fine! Just keep moving!

109
00:10:15,725 --> 00:10:20,180
No, no, no! Take that voodoo-assed thing
off of there right now.

110
00:10:20,291 --> 00:10:22,587
I know you just didn't call
Saint Christopher voodoo.

111
00:10:22,692 --> 00:10:24,555
Man's the patron saint
of travelers, dog.

112
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:27,522
You had a conversation
with God, huh? What did God say?

113
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:31,751
"Go forth, my son, and leave big slobbery
suction rings on every dashboard you find"?

114
00:10:31,858 --> 00:10:33,323
Why the hell do you do that?

115
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:36,289
Look at the way your crazy ass drive,
then ask me again.

116
00:10:44,024 --> 00:10:46,547
Chevy pickup and Mercedes
driving north on Balboa.

117
00:10:46,658 --> 00:10:49,419
Pickup cuts in front. Driver of the
Mercedes gets pissed, pulls a gun.

118
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:52,151
Doesn't realize the guy in the
pickup is a cop coming off shift.

119
00:10:52,258 --> 00:10:54,190
This Barry Gibb dude is a cop?

120
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:56,655
Yeah. Name's Conklin.
He's a narc out of Wilshire.

121
00:10:56,758 --> 00:10:59,417
I got the Mercedes.

122
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:03,150
Mercedes takes a shot at him.
Detective Conklin returns fire. One shot.

123
00:11:03,258 --> 00:11:06,816
Mercedes rolls to a stop.
Driver opens the door, falls out dead.

124
00:11:06,925 --> 00:11:09,720
He looks very relaxed
for just having shot somebody.

125
00:11:09,825 --> 00:11:11,688
He says he kept tryin'
to drive away.

126
00:11:11,792 --> 00:11:14,000
The Mercedes kept pulling up next to him,
screaming, waving a gun.

127
00:11:14,024 --> 00:11:16,547
Shot back in self-defense.

128
00:11:16,658 --> 00:11:20,852
- Anybody actually see who shot first?
- They just heard two bangs.

129
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,788
Find me a witness.

130
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,720
That is a nice gun.

131
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:44,382
The car's registered
to a Cindy Bradley.

132
00:11:44,491 --> 00:11:46,354
And that's not Cindy.

133
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:49,253
That is a William Lewis.

134
00:11:49,358 --> 00:11:52,324
Found under the front seat.
Hollywood Division.

135
00:11:56,792 --> 00:12:00,724
Looks like Detective Conklin
shot himself the wrong nigger.

136
00:12:12,325 --> 00:12:15,450
- How much longer are you gonna be?
- This is the last one.

137
00:12:15,558 --> 00:12:17,456
Thank you.

138
00:12:26,191 --> 00:12:28,555
You don't think reporters
listen to police calls?

139
00:12:28,658 --> 00:12:30,453
I need to talk to you
for a second.

140
00:12:32,325 --> 00:12:34,814
You just give me a minute,
all right?

141
00:12:34,924 --> 00:12:38,448
- Find Flanagan, will you? Now.
- Yes, sir.

142
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:40,491
Yes, honey?

143
00:12:40,558 --> 00:12:42,524
I want the locks changed
again in the morning.

144
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:43,625
You want...

145
00:12:43,692 --> 00:12:46,351
Why don't you just go lie down?
Have you checked on James?

146
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:49,720
Of course. I've checked on him every five
minutes since we've been home.

147
00:12:49,825 --> 00:12:53,723
Do not patronize me. I want the locks
changed again in the morning.

148
00:12:54,425 --> 00:12:57,118
It's okay. Just go to bed.

149
00:12:57,224 --> 00:13:00,713
You know, didn't I just ask you
not to treat me like a child?

150
00:13:00,824 --> 00:13:03,052
I'm sorry, Miss Jean.

151
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:04,590
Is okay I go home now?

152
00:13:04,692 --> 00:13:07,487
It's fine. Thank you
very much for staying.

153
00:13:07,592 --> 00:13:09,734
- You're welcome, no problem. Good night.
- Good night.

154
00:13:09,758 --> 00:13:11,223
We'll see you tomorrow.

155
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:15,451
I would like the locks
changed again in the morning.

156
00:13:15,558 --> 00:13:17,853
And you might mention
that we'd appreciate it

157
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:20,151
if next time they didn't send
a gang member.

158
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:22,554
- A gang member? You mean that kid in there?
- Yes, yes.

159
00:13:22,658 --> 00:13:26,351
Yes. The guy with the shaved head, the
pants around his ass, the prison tattoo.

160
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,967
- Those are not prison tattoos.
- Oh, really? And he's not gonna sell our key

161
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:31,583
to one of his gangbanger friends
the moment he is out our door?

162
00:13:31,692 --> 00:13:32,589
We've had a tough night.

163
00:13:32,692 --> 00:13:36,351
- It'd be best if you went...
- And wait for them to break in?

164
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:39,912
I just had a gun
pointed in my face.

165
00:13:40,024 --> 00:13:41,149
You lower your voice!

166
00:13:41,258 --> 00:13:43,985
And it was my fault
because I knew it was gonna happen.

167
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:46,614
But if a white person sees two black men
walking towards her,

168
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:50,248
and she turns and walks in the
other direction, she's a racist, right?

169
00:13:50,358 --> 00:13:52,949
Well, I got scared
and I didn't say anything.

170
00:13:53,058 --> 00:13:55,320
And ten seconds later
I had a gun in my face!

171
00:13:55,425 --> 00:13:59,619
I am telling you. Your amigo in there is
gonna sell our key to one of his homies.

172
00:13:59,725 --> 00:14:04,214
And this time it'd be really fucking great
if you acted like you actually gave a shit!

173
00:14:31,658 --> 00:14:34,351
All right, what have we got?
Talk to me, Karen.

174
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,424
Flanagan doesn't think
anybody has the story yet.

175
00:14:36,525 --> 00:14:38,888
I'm the goddamn District Attorney
of Los Angeles.

176
00:14:38,991 --> 00:14:42,185
If my car gets jacked,
it's gonna make news.

177
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,086
Fuck!

178
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,553
Why did these guys
have to be black?

179
00:14:47,658 --> 00:14:51,090
I mean, why?
No matter how we spin this,

180
00:14:51,191 --> 00:14:54,271
I'm either gonna lose the black vote
or I'm gonna lose the law-and-order vote.

181
00:14:54,358 --> 00:14:59,518
You're worrying too much. You have
a lot of support in the black community.

182
00:14:59,625 --> 00:15:02,267
All right. If we can't duck this thing,
we're gonna have to neutralize it.

183
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:06,848
What we need is a picture of me
pinning a medal on a black man.

184
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:08,924
Bruce?

185
00:15:10,091 --> 00:15:11,750
The firefighter.

186
00:15:11,857 --> 00:15:14,789
The one who saved the camp or something.
Northridge. What's his name?

187
00:15:14,891 --> 00:15:16,914
He's Iraqi.

188
00:15:17,024 --> 00:15:20,184
He's Iraqi?
Well, he looks black.

189
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:24,087
He's dark-skinned, sir, but he's Iraqi.
His name's Saddam Khahum.

190
00:15:24,191 --> 00:15:27,180
Saddam?
His-His name's Saddam?

191
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:31,417
That's real good, Bruce. I'm gonna
pin a medal on an Iraqi named Saddam.

192
00:15:31,525 --> 00:15:33,683
Give yourself a raise!

193
00:15:36,691 --> 00:15:40,180
It's been good
doing business with you.

194
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:43,655
- How soon can I have them?
- I'm picking them up right now.

195
00:15:43,757 --> 00:15:47,383
Look, you're not listening to me.
This is an emergency.

196
00:15:47,491 --> 00:15:50,355
I keep telling you he's in pain.
He can't sleep.

197
00:15:50,458 --> 00:15:54,356
Mr. Ryan, your father has been to
the clinic three times in the last month.

198
00:15:54,458 --> 00:15:59,754
He is being treated for a urinary tract
infection. That is by no means an emergency.

199
00:15:59,857 --> 00:16:03,221
If you have any more questions
about your HMO plan,

200
00:16:03,325 --> 00:16:07,654
make an appointment to come in between
10:00 and 4:00, Monday through Friday.

201
00:16:07,757 --> 00:16:09,814
What does my father do
about sleeping tonight?

202
00:16:09,924 --> 00:16:11,787
I don't know.
I'm not a doctor.

203
00:16:11,891 --> 00:16:14,789
- I wanna talk to your supervisor.
- I am my supervisor!

204
00:16:14,891 --> 00:16:16,686
- What is your name?
- Shaniqua Johnson.

205
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,485
Shaniqua.
Big fucking surprise that is.

206
00:16:35,757 --> 00:16:38,121
Bronson Avenue, Westwood.

207
00:16:38,224 --> 00:16:40,917
Vehicle is described as a black,
late-model Lincoln Navigator.

208
00:16:41,024 --> 00:16:45,548
California plates,
4 Peter Charles Ida 315.

209
00:16:45,657 --> 00:16:49,090
Suspects are two black males,
approximately 20 years of age.

210
00:16:57,591 --> 00:17:01,648
That's not it. That's not the vehicle,
John. The plates don't match.

211
00:17:01,757 --> 00:17:06,486
The driver's gotta be 40. Nobody
jacks a car and takes it to Studio City.

212
00:17:10,624 --> 00:17:12,988
They were doin' something!

213
00:17:57,158 --> 00:17:58,555
Enthusiastic.

214
00:17:59,757 --> 00:18:01,916
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em, please.

215
00:18:02,024 --> 00:18:06,252
I'm gonna need to see your driver's license
and registration.

216
00:18:06,358 --> 00:18:08,516
No problem.

217
00:18:08,624 --> 00:18:12,522
I'm gonna have to reach inside the glove
compartment to get the registration.

218
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:16,488
- Is that okay?
- Nice and slow, please.

219
00:18:20,624 --> 00:18:22,852
How are you tonight, Officer?

220
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,821
Excellent.

221
00:18:26,691 --> 00:18:29,089
Here you go.

222
00:18:31,657 --> 00:18:33,714
Stay inside the vehicle, please.

223
00:18:43,091 --> 00:18:45,886
Let's do it again right now.

224
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:48,014
Step outta the car, please, sir.

225
00:18:48,124 --> 00:18:51,817
Wait a minute, Officer.
I haven't been drinking or anything.

226
00:18:51,924 --> 00:18:54,152
Then we shouldn't have
a problem.

227
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,917
He doesn't drink.
He's a Buddhist, for Christ's sake.

228
00:18:57,024 --> 00:18:58,853
No, it's okay.

229
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,480
It's fine.

230
00:19:03,891 --> 00:19:07,255
Step onto the sidewalk, sir.

231
00:19:09,091 --> 00:19:11,353
That's good. Right there.

232
00:19:13,158 --> 00:19:15,420
Look at me.

233
00:19:15,524 --> 00:19:17,456
I want you to stand
on your right foot.

234
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:21,717
Touch your nose with the index finger
of your left hand.

235
00:19:26,091 --> 00:19:28,682
I told you he doesn't drink.

236
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:31,450
Ma'am, I'm only gonna tell you
one time to stay in the vehicle.

237
00:19:31,557 --> 00:19:34,115
- Ma'am?
- Honey, honey, I'm okay. I got this.

238
00:19:34,224 --> 00:19:36,567
Don't you "ma'am" me. Who the hell
do you think you're talking to?

239
00:19:36,591 --> 00:19:40,887
Look, Officer, my wife
has had a couple of drinks...

240
00:19:40,991 --> 00:19:44,034
Both of you, turn around. Put your hands on
top of your head and interlock your fingers.

241
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:45,853
Wait. We're only a block
away from our house.

242
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:48,288
Hands on your head.
Interlock your fingers.

243
00:19:48,391 --> 00:19:51,515
- Hands on your head. Interlock your fingers.
- I'm a television director.

244
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:54,386
Me and my wife were just coming home
from an awards show.

245
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:56,752
Take your hands off him.
He's done nothing wrong.

246
00:19:56,857 --> 00:19:59,016
Put your hands on top
of your head, ma'am.

247
00:19:59,124 --> 00:20:00,612
- Do what he says.
- Fuck you!

248
00:20:00,724 --> 00:20:04,588
- Put your hands...
- And you keep your filthy hands off me!

249
00:20:04,691 --> 00:20:06,351
You motherfucking pig!

250
00:20:06,457 --> 00:20:09,946
- Just stop talking!
- That's quite a mouth you have.

251
00:20:10,058 --> 00:20:11,819
Of course you know that.

252
00:20:11,924 --> 00:20:15,686
Fuck you! That's what
this is all about, isn't it?

253
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:18,667
You thought you saw a white woman blowin' a
black man. That drove your cracker ass crazy.

254
00:20:18,691 --> 00:20:20,418
Will you just shut
your fucking mouth!

255
00:20:20,524 --> 00:20:23,581
I'd listen to your husband, ma'am.

256
00:20:23,691 --> 00:20:25,987
Put your legs open.

257
00:20:27,757 --> 00:20:32,019
Do you have any guns or knives
or anything I might get stuck with?

258
00:20:32,124 --> 00:20:34,453
I'm wearing a cocktail dress.
What do you think?

259
00:20:34,557 --> 00:20:37,046
You'd be surprised
some of the places I've found weapons.

260
00:20:37,158 --> 00:20:38,158
He's clean.

261
00:20:39,624 --> 00:20:42,988
What do you think we should do about this,
Mr. Thayer?

262
00:20:43,091 --> 00:20:47,648
My partner and I just witnessed your wife
performing fellatio on you

263
00:20:47,757 --> 00:20:49,916
while you were operating
a motor vehicle.

264
00:20:50,024 --> 00:20:54,116
That's reckless endangerment,
which incidentally is a felony.

265
00:20:56,124 --> 00:21:00,715
We could charge your wife with lewd conduct
and performing a sexual act in public.

266
00:21:03,024 --> 00:21:05,751
You say you're a block
from home.

267
00:21:05,857 --> 00:21:08,153
We could use our discretion

268
00:21:08,258 --> 00:21:11,315
and let you go with a warning,

269
00:21:11,424 --> 00:21:14,857
or we could cuff you and put you
in the back of the car.

270
00:21:16,524 --> 00:21:19,422
What do you think
we should do, sir?

271
00:21:26,891 --> 00:21:30,119
Look, we're sorry, and

272
00:21:30,224 --> 00:21:35,747
we would appreciate if you would
just let us go with a warning, please.

273
00:21:40,357 --> 00:21:43,085
The man's apologizing, Tommy.

274
00:21:43,191 --> 00:21:46,248
I think we can let him go. Don't you?

275
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:50,583
Yeah.

276
00:21:50,691 --> 00:21:52,884
All right.

277
00:21:54,024 --> 00:21:56,819
You can go.

278
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:07,319
You folks drive safe now, huh?

279
00:22:41,557 --> 00:22:43,921
Let's go, Tommy.

280
00:22:52,058 --> 00:22:53,956
It won't close.

281
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:56,248
I can do that.

282
00:22:56,357 --> 00:22:59,017
Dad, you couldn't even
get it open.

283
00:22:59,124 --> 00:23:02,022
Have respect for your father.
Give me the gun!

284
00:23:02,124 --> 00:23:04,783
Here. Now you can shoot
anybody you want.

285
00:23:04,891 --> 00:23:07,652
Dorri, that man
could've killed your mother.

286
00:23:07,757 --> 00:23:11,245
You think I should let crazy people
do what they want to us?

287
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:12,846
Farhad, it won't close.

288
00:23:16,591 --> 00:23:19,989
Dorri, you should be at work.

289
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:33,356
Who are you calling?

290
00:23:33,457 --> 00:23:36,083
I'm gonna report their asses.
Sons of bitches.

291
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:40,180
You actually believe they're gonna take
anything you have to say seriously?

292
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:45,188
Do you have any idea how that felt? To have
that pig's hands all over me?

293
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,155
And you just stood there!

294
00:23:48,257 --> 00:23:50,348
And then you apologized to him?

295
00:23:50,457 --> 00:23:53,355
What did you want me to do?
Get us both shot?

296
00:23:53,457 --> 00:23:56,946
They were gonna shoot us
on Ventura Boulevard! Pathetic.

297
00:23:57,058 --> 00:24:00,751
Well, maybe you would've been satisfied
with just being arrested.

298
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:04,721
Oh, I get it. Much better to let him
shove his hand up my crotch

299
00:24:04,824 --> 00:24:07,619
than get your name in the paper.

300
00:24:07,724 --> 00:24:09,917
You finally got me
figured out, 'cause see,

301
00:24:10,024 --> 00:24:12,854
that's exactly
what I was worried about.

302
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:15,947
Oh? You weren't afraid that all your good
friends at the studio

303
00:24:16,058 --> 00:24:19,922
were gonna read about you in the morning
and realize he's actually black?

304
00:24:21,557 --> 00:24:23,580
You need to calm down right now.

305
00:24:23,691 --> 00:24:28,521
What I need is a husband who will not just
stand there while I am being molested!

306
00:24:28,624 --> 00:24:31,590
They were cops for God sakes!
They had guns!

307
00:24:33,257 --> 00:24:35,985
Maybe I should've let them
arrest your ass.

308
00:24:36,091 --> 00:24:39,853
Sooner or later you gotta find out
what it is really like to be black.

309
00:24:39,958 --> 00:24:42,685
Fuck you, man.
Like you know.

310
00:24:42,791 --> 00:24:46,484
The closest you ever came to being black,
Cameron, was watching The Cosby Show.

311
00:24:46,591 --> 00:24:49,682
At least I wasn't watching it with
the rest of the equestrian team.

312
00:24:49,791 --> 00:24:51,950
You're right, Cameron.
I got a lot to learn

313
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:55,148
'cause I haven't quite learned
how to shuck and jive.

314
00:24:55,257 --> 00:24:58,121
Let me hear it again.
Thank you, mister policeman.

315
00:24:58,223 --> 00:25:00,951
You sure is mighty kind
to us poor black folk.

316
00:25:01,058 --> 00:25:05,581
You be sure to let me know next time
you wanna finger-fuck my wife.

317
00:25:07,123 --> 00:25:10,090
How the fuck do you say
something like that to me?

318
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:13,848
You know, fuck you!

319
00:25:14,891 --> 00:25:18,152
That's good. A little anger.
It's a bit late, but it's nice to see!

320
00:26:07,924 --> 00:26:08,947
How's it goin'

321
00:26:09,057 --> 00:26:10,785
Okay.

322
00:26:10,891 --> 00:26:13,016
You didn't get scared
or something, did you?

323
00:26:13,123 --> 00:26:15,919
There's no monsters in the closet, right?
'Cause I hate monsters.

324
00:26:16,024 --> 00:26:18,990
There's no such thing
as monsters.

325
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:22,682
- Ah, that's a good thing.
- I heard a bang.

326
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:24,381
Like a truck bang?

327
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:26,581
Like a gun.

328
00:26:33,824 --> 00:26:37,654
That's funny, 'cause we moved
outta that bad neighborhood.

329
00:26:37,757 --> 00:26:41,849
And there's not
too many guns around here.

330
00:26:41,958 --> 00:26:44,321
How far can bullets go?

331
00:26:44,424 --> 00:26:46,390
They go pretty far.

332
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:49,388
But they usually get stuck
in something and stop.

333
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:51,046
What if they don't?

334
00:26:51,157 --> 00:26:54,920
You thinking about that bullet that came
through your window?

335
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:00,313
'Cause we never
did find it, did we?

336
00:27:00,424 --> 00:27:03,948
I think it didn't see me
'cause I was under the covers.

337
00:27:04,057 --> 00:27:09,046
Hmm. You think it was that same
bullet that you heard tonight?

338
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:14,416
You think we should move again?

339
00:27:14,524 --> 00:27:15,524
I like it here.

340
00:27:15,591 --> 00:27:19,546
Me too. But if that bullet found out
where we lived...

341
00:27:19,657 --> 00:27:20,657
Oh, hold on.

342
00:27:20,757 --> 00:27:22,245
What?

343
00:27:22,357 --> 00:27:24,448
So stupid!
How can I forget this?

344
00:27:24,557 --> 00:27:26,819
What?

345
00:27:28,257 --> 00:27:30,450
Nah. Forget it.
You ain't gonna believe me.

346
00:27:30,557 --> 00:27:33,045
Tell me.

347
00:27:33,157 --> 00:27:35,589
Okay.

348
00:27:35,691 --> 00:27:38,555
When I was five, this fairy
came into my room one night.

349
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:42,020
- Right.
- I told you, you weren't gonna believe me.

350
00:27:42,123 --> 00:27:44,612
- Okay, go to sleep now, you little rat.
- No, tell me.

351
00:27:46,757 --> 00:27:49,018
Okay.

352
00:27:49,123 --> 00:27:54,385
So this fairy comes into my room and
I'm like, "Yeah, right, you're a fairy."

353
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:56,513
Anyway, we're talking, you know.

354
00:27:56,624 --> 00:27:59,715
And she's flying all around the room,
knocking down all my posters and stuff.

355
00:27:59,824 --> 00:28:02,187
She was flying?

356
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:04,999
She had these little stubby wings.
She could've glued 'em on, you know?

357
00:28:05,023 --> 00:28:07,649
Like I'm gonna believe she's a fairy.

358
00:28:07,757 --> 00:28:09,723
So she said, "I'll prove it."

359
00:28:09,824 --> 00:28:12,415
So she reaches
into her backpack.

360
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,854
And she pulls out
this invisible cloak.

361
00:28:14,957 --> 00:28:19,549
She ties it around my neck,
and she tells me that it's impenetrable.

362
00:28:19,657 --> 00:28:21,885
You know what
impenetrable means?

363
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,854
It means that nothing
can go through it.

364
00:28:23,957 --> 00:28:26,219
No bullets. Nothing.

365
00:28:26,324 --> 00:28:30,120
She told me that if I wore it,
nothing would hurt me.

366
00:28:30,223 --> 00:28:35,178
So I did. And my whole life,
I never got shot, stabbed.

367
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:38,256
Nothing.
I mean, how weird is that?

368
00:28:38,357 --> 00:28:42,289
Only she told me that I was supposed to give
it to my daughter on her fifth birthday.

369
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,151
And I forgot.

370
00:28:44,257 --> 00:28:45,746
Can I touch it?

371
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:47,913
Sure, go ahead.

372
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:53,313
- I don't feel it.
- Yeah. It's pretty cool, huh?

373
00:28:53,424 --> 00:28:57,288
I can take it off and tie it around your
shoulders. She told me how to do it.

374
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:01,015
- Unless you think it's stupid.
- Don't you need it?

375
00:29:01,123 --> 00:29:03,918
No, not anymore.

376
00:29:04,023 --> 00:29:06,955
So what do you think?
You want it?

377
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:15,019
Okay, let's get outta here.

378
00:29:20,824 --> 00:29:22,982
Okay.

379
00:29:35,724 --> 00:29:38,315
Put your head up.

380
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:45,949
Okay. Is that too tight?

381
00:29:46,057 --> 00:29:48,546
Do you feel anything at all?

382
00:29:48,657 --> 00:29:51,054
Good. Then
it's just right.

383
00:29:57,324 --> 00:29:59,812
Do I take it off
when I have a bath?

384
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,685
No, you leave it on
all the time.

385
00:30:02,791 --> 00:30:08,155
Until you have a daughter when
she turns five, then you give it to her.

386
00:30:08,257 --> 00:30:10,382
Okay?

387
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:13,752
Okay.

388
00:30:13,856 --> 00:30:17,289
Okay.
Good night, sweetie.

389
00:30:18,524 --> 00:30:20,183
Good night.

390
00:31:00,223 --> 00:31:03,656
Nah, nah. You wanna listen to music
of the oppressor, you go right ahead, man.

391
00:31:03,756 --> 00:31:07,779
How in the lunacy of your mind is hip-hop
music of the oppressor?

392
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:11,152
Listen to it, man!
"Nigger this, nigger that."

393
00:31:11,257 --> 00:31:14,690
You think white people go around calling
each other honkies all day, man?

394
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,313
"Hey, honky, how's business?"

395
00:31:16,424 --> 00:31:18,322
"Going great, cracker.
We're diversifying."

396
00:31:18,424 --> 00:31:23,288
How 'bout this, huh? Listen. You like that?
Man's singin' about lynchin' niggers.

397
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:25,266
And you think there's
a difference, don't you? Huh?

398
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:29,382
Gonna buy me a rope
and lynch me a nigger.

399
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:32,650
You have absolutely no idea where hip-hop
music comes from, do you?

400
00:31:32,756 --> 00:31:35,279
I'd shoot 'em dead first
but I done broke my trigger.

401
00:31:35,390 --> 00:31:37,652
See, back in the '60s we had
smart, articulate black men.

402
00:31:37,756 --> 00:31:39,915
Gonna get out my sheet
Put my hood on my head.

403
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:43,046
Like Huey Newton, Bobby Seale,
Eldridge Cleaver, Fred Hampton.

404
00:31:43,157 --> 00:31:44,521
Gonna string 'em up good.

405
00:31:44,624 --> 00:31:46,500
These brothers were speaking out good,
and people were listening!

406
00:31:46,524 --> 00:31:48,217
Then they'll be dead.

407
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:50,313
Then the FBI said,
"No, we can't have that."

408
00:31:50,424 --> 00:31:53,151
Home of the brave
and the land of the free.

409
00:31:53,257 --> 00:31:55,466
"Let's give the niggers this music
by a bunch of mumbling idiots

410
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:58,285
and sooner or later,
they'll all copy it, and nobody

411
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,390
will be able to understand
a fucking word they say.

412
00:32:00,424 --> 00:32:01,651
End of problem."

413
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:10,849
What the fuck was that, dog?

414
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:27,518
- Holy shit!
- What?

415
00:32:27,624 --> 00:32:30,089
Man, we done ran over
a Chinaman.

416
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,099
You're sayin' there's a Chinaman
under this truck?

417
00:32:32,123 --> 00:32:33,363
What part don't you understand?

418
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:36,220
There's a Chinaman stuck
underneath the fucking truck.

419
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:42,419
- Help me.
- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

420
00:32:42,524 --> 00:32:46,217
Ah, God. What the hell did he do,
just leap out in front of the truck?

421
00:32:46,324 --> 00:32:49,347
Man! This is so
completely fucked up.

422
00:32:49,457 --> 00:32:51,320
Oh, really? No shit!

423
00:32:51,424 --> 00:32:54,481
Okay, hold up.
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

424
00:32:54,591 --> 00:32:56,557
- Get back in the truck.
- What?

425
00:32:56,656 --> 00:32:58,933
- Yes, get back in the truck.
- You think we didn't drag him far enough?

426
00:32:58,957 --> 00:33:01,855
No, we gonna drive away.
And he gonna let go.

427
00:33:01,957 --> 00:33:03,617
He's not gonna let go, Anthony.

428
00:33:03,723 --> 00:33:06,814
You know why? Because he's stuck
underneath the fucking truck!

429
00:33:06,923 --> 00:33:12,151
Now, if he could've let go, he probably would've
considered that option half a block back.

430
00:33:12,257 --> 00:33:15,780
What you and I gotta do, just grab his arms
and pull him from underneath.

431
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,481
You grab his arm,
it's gonna fall off.

432
00:33:17,591 --> 00:33:20,386
Then you gonna be standing in the street
holding a Chinaman's arm.

433
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:23,217
Then what your ass
gonna do, huh?

434
00:33:23,324 --> 00:33:26,915
If we leave this man here, he dies.
Then we're up for murder charges.

435
00:33:27,023 --> 00:33:30,921
Just grab his arm.
We'll just pull him out.

436
00:33:35,756 --> 00:33:39,382
I don't wanna cause any problems,
Lieutenant. I just want a new partner.

437
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:41,547
I understand.
Your partner's a racist prick.

438
00:33:41,656 --> 00:33:44,088
But you don't wanna stir up
any bad feelings with him.

439
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,985
He's been on the force
for a long time.

440
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:48,249
Seventeen years.

441
00:33:48,357 --> 00:33:50,584
And I do have to work here, sir.

442
00:33:50,690 --> 00:33:53,088
So you don't mind that there's
a racist prick on the force.

443
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:56,156
You just don't want him
to ride in your car.

444
00:33:56,257 --> 00:33:59,052
If you need me to go on record
about this, sir, I will.

445
00:33:59,157 --> 00:34:00,986
That'd be great.
Write a full report.

446
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:03,851
Because I'm anxious to
understand how an obvious bigot

447
00:34:03,957 --> 00:34:06,889
could've gone undetected
in this department for 17 years.

448
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:09,149
Eleven of which he was under
my personal supervision.

449
00:34:09,257 --> 00:34:11,654
Which doesn't speak very highly
of my managerial skills.

450
00:34:11,756 --> 00:34:15,519
But that's not your concern.
I can't wait to read it.

451
00:34:15,623 --> 00:34:19,522
What if I said I wanted a new partner
for personal reasons?

452
00:34:19,623 --> 00:34:22,885
So now you're saying he's not a
racist prick, you just don't like him.

453
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:25,922
- Yes, sir.
- That's not a good enough reason.

454
00:34:26,023 --> 00:34:28,921
Then I guess I should think of a better one
and get back to you.

455
00:34:29,023 --> 00:34:31,887
So you think I'm asking you
to make one up.

456
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:36,752
Uh, no, sir. I just can't
think of one... right now.

457
00:34:36,856 --> 00:34:38,947
You wanna know what I heard?

458
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:42,447
I heard it was a case
of uncontrollable flatulence.

459
00:34:42,556 --> 00:34:44,749
You want me to say
he has flatulence?

460
00:34:44,856 --> 00:34:47,617
Not him. You. You have
uncontrollable flatulence.

461
00:34:47,723 --> 00:34:51,383
You're too embarrassed to ride with anybody
else so you're requesting a one-man car.

462
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:54,115
I'm not... comfortable with that,
Lieutenant.

463
00:34:54,223 --> 00:34:57,155
I wouldn't be either. Which is why
I understand your need for privacy.

464
00:34:57,257 --> 00:35:01,019
Just like I'm sure you understand how hard
a black man has to work to get to,

465
00:35:01,123 --> 00:35:04,283
say, where I am, in a racist fucking
organization like the L.A.P.D.

466
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:07,379
And how easily
that can be taken away.

467
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:10,614
Now, that being said,
it's your decision.

468
00:35:10,723 --> 00:35:15,553
You can put your career and mine
on the line in pursuit of a just cause,

469
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:19,554
or you can admit to having
an embarrassing problem

470
00:35:19,656 --> 00:35:21,952
of a personal nature.

471
00:35:25,324 --> 00:35:27,290
Fuck.

472
00:35:57,590 --> 00:35:59,783
Excuse me.

473
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:02,481
Excuse me. Sir?

474
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:04,522
You finished?

475
00:36:04,623 --> 00:36:07,748
I replaced the lock. But you got
a real problem with that door.

476
00:36:07,856 --> 00:36:10,322
You fix the lock?

477
00:36:10,424 --> 00:36:14,617
Nah, I replaced the lock.
But you gotta fix that door.

478
00:36:14,723 --> 00:36:18,121
- Just fix the lock!
- Sir, listen to me.

479
00:36:18,223 --> 00:36:21,314
What you need is a new door.

480
00:36:21,423 --> 00:36:23,981
- I need new door?
- Yeah.

481
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:26,555
Okay. How much?

482
00:36:26,656 --> 00:36:30,520
I don't... Sir, you're gonna have to call
somebody that sells doors.

483
00:36:30,623 --> 00:36:34,749
You try to cheat me, right?
You have a friend that fix door?

484
00:36:34,856 --> 00:36:36,981
Nah, I don't have a friend
that fix doors, bro.

485
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:39,419
Then go and fix
the fucking lock, you cheater.

486
00:36:39,523 --> 00:36:42,285
You... You know what?

487
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:45,913
Why don't you just pay for the lock
and I won't charge you for the time.

488
00:36:46,023 --> 00:36:48,420
You don't fix the lock!
I pay! You think I'm stupid?

489
00:36:48,523 --> 00:36:51,614
You fix the fucking lock,
you cheater!

490
00:36:51,723 --> 00:36:54,365
- I'd appreciate if you'd stop calling me names.
- Then fix the fucking lock!

491
00:36:54,389 --> 00:36:57,753
I replaced the lock!
You gotta fix the fucking door!

492
00:36:57,856 --> 00:37:01,084
You cheat!
You fucking cheater!

493
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:03,917
- Fine. Don't pay.
- What?

494
00:37:04,023 --> 00:37:06,750
- Have a good night.
- What? No. Wait!

495
00:37:06,856 --> 00:37:09,822
Wait! You come back here!
You fix the lock!

496
00:37:09,923 --> 00:37:13,787
Come here! You fix my lock!
Fix the fucking lock!

497
00:37:19,957 --> 00:37:23,980
I understand. You run over a Chinaman.
Stuff him in the back.

498
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:26,954
Then bring the truck here
so I can share in the experience.

499
00:37:27,057 --> 00:37:29,818
Come on, man. It's a little bit of blood.
It'll wash right off.

500
00:37:29,923 --> 00:37:32,287
- Georgie, burn this thing.
- Burn it?

501
00:37:32,389 --> 00:37:34,699
It's a brand-new Navigator.
All you need is a little piece of carpet.

502
00:37:34,723 --> 00:37:36,655
You watch the Discovery Channel?

503
00:37:36,756 --> 00:37:40,154
- Not a lot.
- They got some good shit on that channel.

504
00:37:40,257 --> 00:37:43,848
Every night there is a show with somebody
shining a blue light

505
00:37:43,957 --> 00:37:48,151
and finding tiny specks of blood splattered
on carpets and walls and ceiling fans,

506
00:37:48,257 --> 00:37:52,814
bathroom fixtures and special-edition
plastic Burger King tray cups.

507
00:37:52,923 --> 00:37:56,377
The next thing they show is some
stupid redneck in handcuffs

508
00:37:56,489 --> 00:38:00,683
who looks absolutely stunned
that this is happening to him.

509
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:03,813
Sometimes the redneck is actually
watching the Discovery Channel

510
00:38:03,923 --> 00:38:05,912
when they break in
to arrest him.

511
00:38:06,023 --> 00:38:11,251
And he still can't figure out how on earth
they could've caught him!

512
00:38:19,223 --> 00:38:23,121
Do I look like I wanna be
on the Discovery Channel?

513
00:38:23,223 --> 00:38:24,483
No.

514
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:27,385
Then get the fuck outta my shop.

515
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:31,749
Oh, yeah, make sure
you get that.

516
00:38:31,856 --> 00:38:35,220
Without him, things could've gone really
fucking wrong tonight.

517
00:38:37,489 --> 00:38:41,081
- Fuck!
- Don't! Don't you dare.

518
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:43,053
Don't.

519
00:38:43,157 --> 00:38:46,248
Graham Waters.

520
00:38:46,356 --> 00:38:50,618
No. No, he's not here, Mom.

521
00:38:52,057 --> 00:38:55,046
I'm not gonna go
looking for him.

522
00:38:55,157 --> 00:38:58,452
Look, he'll be home when...
Just leave it alone.

523
00:38:58,556 --> 00:39:03,216
Mom, I can't talk to you right now, okay?
I'm having sex with a white woman.

524
00:39:03,323 --> 00:39:05,755
Okay, where were we?

525
00:39:05,856 --> 00:39:08,321
I was white, and you were
about to jerk off in the shower.

526
00:39:08,752 --> 00:39:11,616
Oh, shit!

527
00:39:11,718 --> 00:39:13,843
Come on.

528
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:18,907
I would've said you were Mexican, but I don't
think it would've pissed her off as much.

529
00:39:19,019 --> 00:39:21,280
Why do you keep everybody
at a certain distance, huh?

530
00:39:21,385 --> 00:39:25,113
- What, you start to feel something and panic?
- Come on, Maria.

531
00:39:25,219 --> 00:39:28,673
You're just pissed
'cause I answered the phone.

532
00:39:28,785 --> 00:39:31,081
That's just where
I begin to get pissed.

533
00:39:31,185 --> 00:39:34,582
I mean, really, what kind of man
speaks to his mother that way?

534
00:39:34,685 --> 00:39:38,742
Oh, this is about my mother.
What do you know about my mother?

535
00:39:38,852 --> 00:39:41,716
If I was your father,
I'd kick your fucking ass.

536
00:39:43,185 --> 00:39:45,174
Okay. I was raised badly.

537
00:39:45,285 --> 00:39:48,718
Why don't you take your clothes off,
get back into bed and teach me a lesson?

538
00:39:48,818 --> 00:39:52,773
You want a lesson? I'll give you a lesson.
How 'bout a geography lesson?

539
00:39:52,885 --> 00:39:57,011
My father's from Puerto Rico.
My mother's from El Salvador.

540
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,176
Neither one of those is Mexico.

541
00:40:00,285 --> 00:40:02,717
Ah. Then I guess
the big mystery is

542
00:40:02,818 --> 00:40:06,306
who gathered all those remarkably
different cultures together

543
00:40:06,418 --> 00:40:09,441
and taught them all how to park
their cars on their lawns?

544
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:39,548
Pop, you okay?

545
00:40:39,652 --> 00:40:42,675
If I could piss, I'd be okay.

546
00:40:44,218 --> 00:40:46,946
I'm... Jesus.

547
00:40:47,052 --> 00:40:49,540
I'm done now.

548
00:40:49,652 --> 00:40:51,675
Give me a hand.

549
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,108
Wait a goddamn minute!

550
00:40:56,218 --> 00:40:58,878
- Wait a minute.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

551
00:41:00,852 --> 00:41:04,306
All right. Okay. Okay.

552
00:41:11,685 --> 00:41:14,344
Wait, wait, wait.
Stop, stop!

553
00:41:14,451 --> 00:41:17,111
- I gotta go back.
- Okay.

554
00:41:29,451 --> 00:41:32,474
What, are you gonna
stand there and stare at me?

555
00:42:41,385 --> 00:42:44,011
- So Conklin just shot him?
- Mm-hmm.

556
00:42:44,118 --> 00:42:47,050
- They know each other? It's a grudge thing?
- Sir.

557
00:42:47,151 --> 00:42:49,777
Not as far as we can tell.

558
00:42:49,885 --> 00:42:52,180
You think this is
racially motivated?

559
00:42:52,285 --> 00:42:55,615
Well, a dozen people heard the shots.
Nobody saw anything.

560
00:42:55,718 --> 00:42:57,684
- Who do we have on it?
- Graham Waters.

561
00:42:57,785 --> 00:43:01,774
Waters. Tell him he speaks
to no one but me.

562
00:43:01,885 --> 00:43:05,044
Call a press conference for 4:00,
and I want Waters here at 3:30.

563
00:43:05,151 --> 00:43:07,049
And would someone
please find Flanagan.

564
00:43:09,084 --> 00:43:12,312
Oh! What up, Mo Phat?

565
00:43:12,418 --> 00:43:16,783
Man robs purses from old ladies and you,
"Hey, how's it goin', Mo Phat?"

566
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:19,908
That nigger will steal teeth
from a cripple, man.

567
00:43:20,018 --> 00:43:22,541
You callin' him a thief?
And we do what?

568
00:43:22,652 --> 00:43:24,618
The man steals
from black people.

569
00:43:24,718 --> 00:43:27,047
Only reason black people
steal from their own

570
00:43:27,151 --> 00:43:29,777
- is 'cause they terrified of white people.
- Man, please.

571
00:43:29,885 --> 00:43:33,715
Think about it. Sherman Oaks.
Burbank. Santa Monica.

572
00:43:33,818 --> 00:43:36,375
All scary-ass places
for a brother to find himself.

573
00:43:36,485 --> 00:43:38,883
Drop Mo Phat at a Starbucks
in Toluca Lake,

574
00:43:38,984 --> 00:43:43,110
that nigger will run like a rabbit soon
as somebody say "decaf latte."

575
00:43:43,218 --> 00:43:46,446
What the fuck did you do to my car?

576
00:43:53,885 --> 00:43:57,248
Sorry I take your car, Miss Jean.

577
00:43:57,351 --> 00:44:00,317
I turn key to my car,
but nothing.

578
00:44:00,418 --> 00:44:02,350
James wanted
to take this to school.

579
00:44:02,451 --> 00:44:05,144
But I don't want the kids
to fight over it.

580
00:44:05,251 --> 00:44:09,013
- Are these clean or dirty?
- All clean, senora!

581
00:44:09,118 --> 00:44:14,050
You know, Maria, just once I would like to
wake up and find these dishes in the cabinet.

582
00:44:15,385 --> 00:44:17,943
Si, senora.
No problem.

583
00:44:18,984 --> 00:44:20,450
I'm startin' to understand now.

584
00:44:20,551 --> 00:44:24,347
By your work, you're settin'
an example for our neighborhood.

585
00:44:24,451 --> 00:44:26,939
Sort of like a big brother
kind of thing, right?

586
00:44:28,151 --> 00:44:29,447
Yeah, you laugh, man.

587
00:44:29,551 --> 00:44:33,608
But you have never seen me steal
from a black person ever in your life.

588
00:44:35,652 --> 00:44:38,140
What the hell do you think
you doin' right now, man?

589
00:44:38,251 --> 00:44:39,581
Wavin' down the bus.

590
00:44:39,685 --> 00:44:41,980
Put your hand down, dog!
Are you outta your mind?

591
00:44:42,084 --> 00:44:44,448
You actually expect me
to get on a bus?

592
00:44:44,551 --> 00:44:46,813
No. I was hopin' we could
push your car across town.

593
00:44:46,918 --> 00:44:48,927
You know why? 'Cause we just
don't do stuff like that no more.

594
00:44:48,951 --> 00:44:51,577
You have no idea, do you?

595
00:44:51,685 --> 00:44:55,173
You have no idea why they put them great
big windows on the sides of buses, do you?

596
00:44:55,285 --> 00:44:57,843
- Why?
- One reason only.

597
00:44:57,951 --> 00:45:02,247
To humiliate the people of color
who are reduced to ridin' on 'em.

598
00:45:02,351 --> 00:45:03,715
I didn't know that.

599
00:45:03,818 --> 00:45:06,784
You could fill the Staples Center
with what you don't know.

600
00:45:06,885 --> 00:45:08,851
You know the Kings
are playin' tonight.

601
00:45:08,951 --> 00:45:12,315
You don't like hockey! The only reason
you say you do is to piss me off!

602
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:14,748
I love hockey.

603
00:45:14,852 --> 00:45:16,442
Cut! Print. Moving on.

604
00:45:16,551 --> 00:45:20,745
Okay, that takes us into scene 12.

605
00:45:20,852 --> 00:45:23,942
Jamal, that's what
I'm talking about.

606
00:45:24,051 --> 00:45:27,176
Right on.

607
00:45:27,285 --> 00:45:30,649
- Cam, you got a second?
- Yeah, Fred, I just wanna grab some coffee.

608
00:45:30,752 --> 00:45:33,513
Yeah. Listen.
I think we need another take, buddy.

609
00:45:33,618 --> 00:45:36,345
That looked pretty terrific, man.

610
00:45:36,451 --> 00:45:40,611
This is gonna sound strange, but is Jamal
seeing a speech coach or something?

611
00:45:40,718 --> 00:45:42,650
What do you mean?

612
00:45:42,752 --> 00:45:46,206
Have you noticed, uh...
This is weird for a white guy to say,

613
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:50,080
but have you noticed he's talking
a lot less black lately?

614
00:45:51,884 --> 00:45:53,646
No, I haven't noticed that.

615
00:45:53,752 --> 00:45:57,514
Really? Like in this scene, he was supposed
to say, "Don't be talkin' 'bout that."

616
00:45:57,618 --> 00:46:00,140
And he changed it to,
"Don't talk to me about that."

617
00:46:00,251 --> 00:46:01,581
Wait a minute.

618
00:46:01,685 --> 00:46:06,413
You think because of that, the audience
won't recognize him as being a black man?

619
00:46:06,518 --> 00:46:09,541
- Come on!
- Is there a problem, Cam?

620
00:46:09,652 --> 00:46:11,242
Excuse me?

621
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:13,715
Is there a problem, Cam?

622
00:46:18,618 --> 00:46:21,140
No, we don't have a problem.

623
00:46:21,251 --> 00:46:24,513
I mean, 'cause all I'm saying is,
it's not his character.

624
00:46:24,618 --> 00:46:27,209
Eddie's supposed to be
the smart one, not Jamal, right?

625
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:31,045
You're the expert here.
But to me, it rings false.

626
00:46:34,385 --> 00:46:38,181
- We're gonna do it one more time.
- Thanks, buddy.

627
00:46:38,285 --> 00:46:42,217
Everybody back to one, please.
Let's do it one more time.

628
00:46:44,752 --> 00:46:46,842
Jamal, um...

629
00:46:50,351 --> 00:46:52,681
Morning, Carol.
Who do I have?

630
00:46:52,785 --> 00:46:55,580
Hold for a minute, please.
Mr. Trujillo called and canceled,

631
00:46:55,685 --> 00:46:58,412
but you have a walk-in,
Mr. Ryan.

632
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:04,412
Send him in.

633
00:47:04,518 --> 00:47:06,813
- Mr. Ryan.
- Yeah.

634
00:47:06,918 --> 00:47:09,077
My name is Shaniqua Johnson.

635
00:47:09,184 --> 00:47:11,742
I believe we spoke last night.

636
00:47:11,851 --> 00:47:15,147
Oh, yeah. I wanted
to apologize about that.

637
00:47:15,251 --> 00:47:18,445
I haven't been gettin' too much sleep.
My father's in a lot of pain.

638
00:47:18,551 --> 00:47:21,073
Oh! I'm sorry to hear that.

639
00:47:21,184 --> 00:47:25,344
This doctor he's been seein' says
he's got a urinary tract infection.

640
00:47:25,451 --> 00:47:28,905
But he's been takin' this medicine for
a month, and he keeps gettin' worse.

641
00:47:29,018 --> 00:47:31,007
And he's been back to see
Dr. Robertson?

642
00:47:31,118 --> 00:47:33,811
Yeah. Between you and me,
the man's an idiot.

643
00:47:33,918 --> 00:47:35,850
- Really?
- No offense.

644
00:47:35,951 --> 00:47:39,440
But the guy sees 100 patients an hour. I
think his nurses are doing most of the work.

645
00:47:39,551 --> 00:47:44,574
Mmm. If you're unhappy, your father's
welcome to see a doctor outside the network.

646
00:47:44,685 --> 00:47:49,083
And if this new doctor
says it's not an infection,

647
00:47:49,184 --> 00:47:52,344
says it's his prostate and it needs to be
operated on, is that gonna be covered?

648
00:47:52,418 --> 00:47:56,043
- Not unless Dr. Robertson authorizes...
- What good is that gonna do?

649
00:47:56,151 --> 00:47:58,810
I'm sorry. There's nothing else I can do.

650
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:02,476
All right.
You know what I can't do?

651
00:48:02,585 --> 00:48:05,176
I can't look at you without
thinking about the five or six

652
00:48:05,285 --> 00:48:07,683
more qualified white men
who didn't get your job.

653
00:48:07,784 --> 00:48:09,512
It's time for you to go.

654
00:48:09,618 --> 00:48:12,708
I'm saying this 'cause I'm hoping
that I'm wrong about you.

655
00:48:12,817 --> 00:48:14,613
I'm hoping that someone like yourself,

656
00:48:14,717 --> 00:48:16,774
someone who may have
been given a helping hand,

657
00:48:16,884 --> 00:48:19,680
might have a little compassion
for someone in a similar situation.

658
00:48:19,784 --> 00:48:21,943
Carol, I need security
in my office!

659
00:48:22,051 --> 00:48:25,142
You don't like me,
that's fine. I'm a prick.

660
00:48:25,251 --> 00:48:27,808
My father doesn't deserve
to suffer like this.

661
00:48:27,918 --> 00:48:29,884
He was a janitor.
He struggled his whole life.

662
00:48:29,984 --> 00:48:31,813
Saved enough to start
his own company.

663
00:48:31,918 --> 00:48:33,884
Twenty-three employees,
all of them black.

664
00:48:33,984 --> 00:48:36,678
Paid 'em equal wages when
no one else was doing that.

665
00:48:36,784 --> 00:48:41,773
For 30 years he worked side by side with
those men, sweeping and carrying garbage.

666
00:48:41,884 --> 00:48:43,646
Then the city council decides

667
00:48:43,751 --> 00:48:46,979
to give minority-owned companies
preference in city contracts.

668
00:48:47,084 --> 00:48:49,845
And overnight,
my father loses everything.

669
00:48:49,951 --> 00:48:53,349
His business, his home,
his wife. Everything!

670
00:48:53,451 --> 00:48:57,144
Not once does he blame
your people.

671
00:48:57,251 --> 00:49:00,705
I'm not asking you to help me.

672
00:49:00,817 --> 00:49:05,147
I'm asking that you do this small thing
for a man who lost everything

673
00:49:05,251 --> 00:49:07,581
so people like yourself
could reap the benefits.

674
00:49:07,684 --> 00:49:09,980
And do you know
what it's gonna cost you?

675
00:49:10,084 --> 00:49:12,016
Nothing.

676
00:49:12,118 --> 00:49:14,107
Just a flick of your pen.

677
00:49:15,684 --> 00:49:18,617
Your father sounds like
a good man.

678
00:49:18,717 --> 00:49:22,843
And if he'd come in here today, I probably
would've approved this request.

679
00:49:22,951 --> 00:49:27,407
But he didn't come in. You did.
And for his sake, it's a real shame.

680
00:49:27,518 --> 00:49:30,416
- Get him the hell outta my office.
- Prick.

681
00:49:37,518 --> 00:49:42,177
Sir, I spoke to our employee, and he told
you you needed to replace or repair the door.

682
00:49:42,285 --> 00:49:43,773
He say he fix the lock.

683
00:49:43,884 --> 00:49:46,612
- You come here, see how "fix-ed" it is!
- You're yelling again.

684
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:48,615
I am not yelling!
I'm upset!

685
00:49:48,717 --> 00:49:51,081
Yes... Yes, I am.

686
00:49:51,184 --> 00:49:52,809
Mom, are you all right?

687
00:49:52,918 --> 00:49:57,180
Stop washing.
Insurance must take picture.

688
00:49:57,285 --> 00:50:00,046
Okay?

689
00:50:00,151 --> 00:50:02,515
Look what they wrote.

690
00:50:02,617 --> 00:50:04,640
They think we're Arab.

691
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:06,774
When did Persian become Arab?

692
00:50:06,884 --> 00:50:09,714
I want his name. Yes.

693
00:50:09,817 --> 00:50:11,443
Oh, my God.

694
00:50:11,551 --> 00:50:14,574
- I want his name! Give me his name!
- Dad?

695
00:50:14,684 --> 00:50:16,082
I'm not giving you
his name, sir.

696
00:50:16,184 --> 00:50:19,946
- Dad, did they take the gun?
- Not fix my lock! I want his name!

697
00:50:20,051 --> 00:50:22,108
I'm gonna hang up now, sir.

698
00:50:22,218 --> 00:50:25,945
Don't hang up! Shit!

699
00:50:26,051 --> 00:50:27,880
Oh, thank God.

700
00:51:13,784 --> 00:51:16,716
Mom?

701
00:51:16,817 --> 00:51:19,045
Mom, it's cold.
Come on.

702
00:51:41,251 --> 00:51:43,546
Did you find your brother?

703
00:51:45,684 --> 00:51:47,809
No, Mom.

704
00:51:57,285 --> 00:51:59,807
I was doin' good.

705
00:51:59,918 --> 00:52:04,577
I was... I was doin' real good.

706
00:52:06,385 --> 00:52:10,147
- I know, Mom.
- I was doin'...

707
00:52:13,651 --> 00:52:15,583
It's okay.

708
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:29,177
Did you find your brother?

709
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:33,848
No, Mom.

710
00:52:35,184 --> 00:52:37,706
Tell him to come home.

711
00:52:39,118 --> 00:52:44,448
Tell him I'm not mad, okay?
Okay, baby?

712
00:52:44,550 --> 00:52:47,073
Okay, Mom.

713
00:52:47,184 --> 00:52:49,672
Okay, baby.

714
00:52:49,784 --> 00:52:51,375
Okay.

715
00:52:52,418 --> 00:52:54,440
Okay.

716
00:53:30,051 --> 00:53:32,983
- Did you apologize to your mother?
- She wasn't there.

717
00:53:34,951 --> 00:53:38,576
Internal Affairs called. Found something
in the Mercedes.

718
00:53:41,351 --> 00:53:44,874
That's lunch. One hour.

719
00:54:12,717 --> 00:54:14,842
I tried to call.

720
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:19,440
- Sounded like you're havin' a bad day, huh?
- Yeah.

721
00:54:22,784 --> 00:54:25,477
What?

722
00:54:25,584 --> 00:54:27,482
I got scared, Cam.

723
00:54:27,584 --> 00:54:33,040
It's not like I haven't been
pulled over before. You know?

724
00:54:33,151 --> 00:54:35,140
But not like that.

725
00:54:36,484 --> 00:54:38,473
And, yes, I was a little drunk.

726
00:54:38,584 --> 00:54:42,516
And I was mouthing off.

727
00:54:42,617 --> 00:54:44,810
I'm sorry.

728
00:54:46,918 --> 00:54:48,760
But when that man was putting
his hands on me...

729
00:54:48,784 --> 00:54:50,409
I don't wanna talk about it.

730
00:54:50,517 --> 00:54:53,950
I can't believe
you let him do that, baby.

731
00:54:54,051 --> 00:54:58,881
Look, I know what you did
was the right thing. Okay?

732
00:55:00,417 --> 00:55:03,111
But I was humiliated!

733
00:55:03,218 --> 00:55:05,376
For you.

734
00:55:05,484 --> 00:55:10,008
I just couldn't stand to see that man
take away your dignity.

735
00:55:10,118 --> 00:55:13,107
Yeah. That's what happened.

736
00:55:13,218 --> 00:55:16,241
- Oh, baby, don't do this.
- No. No, you're right.

737
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:18,112
I ain't doin' it.

738
00:55:18,218 --> 00:55:20,740
You gonna walk away from me?

739
00:55:20,851 --> 00:55:24,113
- Cameron!
- Just go home.

740
00:55:30,151 --> 00:55:33,878
Mm-hmm. I understand.

741
00:55:35,951 --> 00:55:37,917
Thanks.

742
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:43,948
- Has your father read his policy?
- He doesn't read English.

743
00:55:47,784 --> 00:55:50,046
Mr. Golzari, you said
you called the locksmith?

744
00:55:51,584 --> 00:55:53,107
Yes. I tell him, fix it.

745
00:55:53,218 --> 00:55:56,877
They said their man told you

746
00:55:58,018 --> 00:56:00,279
to fix the door,
and you didn't do so.

747
00:56:02,284 --> 00:56:04,580
Are you saying it's his fault?

748
00:56:05,617 --> 00:56:10,016
Insurance company is calling it negligence.
They're not covering this.

749
00:56:18,851 --> 00:56:22,943
No. This store is all we have.

750
00:56:40,018 --> 00:56:42,075
I really am sorry.

751
00:57:04,584 --> 00:57:06,743
What time you must go to work?

752
00:57:06,851 --> 00:57:09,749
Not until tonight.

753
00:57:09,851 --> 00:57:11,316
Go home and sleep.

754
00:57:14,584 --> 00:57:17,209
It's okay. It's okay.
Go home and sleep.

755
00:57:40,417 --> 00:57:41,542
Hey.

756
00:57:43,284 --> 00:57:46,682
Maybe they didn't tell you,
but I've been reassigned.

757
00:57:46,784 --> 00:57:48,977
Yeah, they told me.

758
00:57:49,084 --> 00:57:51,879
I just wanted to say, good luck

759
00:57:51,984 --> 00:57:53,813
and it was good ridin' with you.

760
00:57:53,918 --> 00:57:55,577
You too.

761
00:57:58,584 --> 00:58:01,846
Wait till you've been on the job
a few more years.

762
00:58:01,951 --> 00:58:05,144
- Yeah.
- Look at me, look at me.

763
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:09,876
Wait till you've been doin' it
a little longer.

764
00:58:09,984 --> 00:58:13,916
You think you know
who you are, hmm?

765
00:58:14,018 --> 00:58:16,848
You have no idea.

766
00:58:20,317 --> 00:58:23,408
Yo, Gomez,
you ready to roll, homie?

767
00:58:23,517 --> 00:58:25,346
Ready, amigo.

768
00:58:35,084 --> 00:58:38,106
Radio check, 2-1-L-2-3.

769
00:58:38,217 --> 00:58:42,877
21-L-23, picking up strange noises
from your car.

770
00:58:42,984 --> 00:58:46,780
21-L, is your mike open
by any chance?

771
01:00:57,925 --> 01:00:59,788
Call it in.

772
01:01:37,257 --> 01:01:39,052
Ma'am?

773
01:01:39,157 --> 01:01:41,180
Can you hear me?

774
01:01:41,291 --> 01:01:43,723
Paramedics are rolling.
They'll be here in two minutes.

775
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:46,882
- Get an extinguisher, and get that fire out.
- Jesus.

776
01:01:50,558 --> 01:01:53,955
Ma'am, are you hurt?

777
01:01:54,057 --> 01:01:57,114
- Can you move?
- I... I can't breathe.

778
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:03,214
Okay, I'm gonna get you out.

779
01:02:09,990 --> 01:02:11,456
It's okay.

780
01:02:15,724 --> 01:02:18,212
Okay. Okay.

781
01:02:18,324 --> 01:02:20,222
Okay, I'm gonna get you out.

782
01:02:24,558 --> 01:02:26,524
No!

783
01:02:26,624 --> 01:02:29,681
- It's okay.
- Get away from me!

784
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:32,847
Get away.
Stay away from me!

785
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:36,219
Not you! Not you!

786
01:02:36,324 --> 01:02:39,119
- It's okay.
- Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

787
01:02:39,224 --> 01:02:42,816
- Keep away from me!
- Lady, I'm tryin'- - I'm tryin' to help you.

788
01:02:42,924 --> 01:02:45,447
Fuck you!
Not you!

789
01:02:45,558 --> 01:02:48,524
Somebody!
Anybody else!

790
01:02:48,624 --> 01:02:52,283
- Please, somebody! Not you!
- Stop moving!

791
01:02:52,391 --> 01:02:55,879
No! Get your filthy
fucking hands off me!

792
01:02:55,990 --> 01:03:00,150
Stop moving. Lady, I'm not
gonna fucking hurt you!

793
01:03:05,124 --> 01:03:07,556
Okay. Okay.

794
01:03:07,658 --> 01:03:10,180
Please don't touch me. Don't, don't.

795
01:03:10,291 --> 01:03:14,087
I'm not gonna touch you.
But there's nobody else here yet

796
01:03:14,191 --> 01:03:16,214
and that's gasoline there.

797
01:03:17,824 --> 01:03:21,120
We need to get you
outta here right away. Okay?

798
01:03:21,224 --> 01:03:23,417
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

799
01:03:23,524 --> 01:03:29,286
Okay. I need to reach across your lap.
Can I do that, please?

800
01:03:32,491 --> 01:03:34,457
Yeah. Yeah.

801
01:03:35,857 --> 01:03:37,517
Thanks.

802
01:03:41,491 --> 01:03:45,253
Is anything broken?

803
01:03:45,357 --> 01:03:47,788
L-I don't think so.

804
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:50,788
Okay. Then that's good.

805
01:03:50,890 --> 01:03:53,413
Are you... Are you
gonna get me out?

806
01:03:53,524 --> 01:03:56,785
Yeah, I'm gonna get
you out. Okay?

807
01:03:56,890 --> 01:04:00,220
Look at me. Look at me.
I'm gonna get you out.

808
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:07,886
Oh, fuck!

809
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:10,979
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

810
01:04:13,157 --> 01:04:15,952
I'm gonna have to cut your belt, okay?

811
01:04:16,057 --> 01:04:18,148
I'm gonna have to cut the belt.

812
01:04:19,124 --> 01:04:20,749
It's okay, it's okay.

813
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:23,551
It's okay. Okay,
we're gonna get you out.

814
01:04:23,658 --> 01:04:25,953
Everything's gonna be fine.
Look at me!

815
01:04:26,057 --> 01:04:28,546
Everything's gonna be fine.
We're gonna get you outta here.

816
01:04:28,658 --> 01:04:30,385
Everything's gonna be fine.

817
01:04:48,757 --> 01:04:49,757
Ryan!

818
01:05:24,658 --> 01:05:26,680
Pull!

819
01:05:40,591 --> 01:05:42,614
It's okay.

820
01:05:52,090 --> 01:05:54,386
It's okay.

821
01:05:54,491 --> 01:05:58,116
All right.
It's okay, it's okay.

822
01:05:58,224 --> 01:06:00,689
It's all right.
I got it. I got it.

823
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:02,847
Ma'am? Ma'am,
can you walk with me?

824
01:06:02,957 --> 01:06:05,253
It's cool, it's cool.

825
01:06:06,657 --> 01:06:09,680
Here we go. All right,
you're doin' great.

826
01:06:40,657 --> 01:06:44,055
The D.A. Wanted me to apologize.
He really wanted to be here himself.

827
01:06:44,157 --> 01:06:46,957
No, he didn't! If he did his own
dirty work none of us would have jobs.

828
01:06:46,990 --> 01:06:49,252
- Jake Flanagan. I work with Rick.
- Graham Waters.

829
01:06:49,357 --> 01:06:52,187
- Thanks for coming in.
- He just pulled into the garage.

830
01:06:52,291 --> 01:06:55,416
Great. Press conference is in ten minutes,
so we'll make this short.

831
01:06:55,524 --> 01:06:58,887
Internal Affairs says this Conklin has two
suspicious shootings on his record.

832
01:06:58,990 --> 01:07:02,252
Both black men. Both times he was cleared,
but only just.

833
01:07:02,357 --> 01:07:05,152
Detective Lewis
makes black man number three.

834
01:07:05,257 --> 01:07:08,711
You know any reason why we shouldn't
hang Conklin for this?

835
01:07:08,824 --> 01:07:13,916
Well, it's more complicated
than we originally thought.

836
01:07:14,024 --> 01:07:19,888
We found $300,000 in the trunk of the car
that Detective Lewis was driving.

837
01:07:19,990 --> 01:07:22,115
Shit!

838
01:07:22,224 --> 01:07:26,713
Ah. Go down to the garage. Tell him
to stay in the car until he hears from me.

839
01:07:26,824 --> 01:07:30,688
You found the money in the Mercedes.
I thought that wasn't his car.

840
01:07:30,790 --> 01:07:34,620
The car's registered to a Cindy Bradley. We
haven't been able to get in touch with her.

841
01:07:34,723 --> 01:07:38,212
Apparently she, uh,
left town this morning.

842
01:07:38,324 --> 01:07:42,086
So it wasn't Lewis's car. He may not
have known the money was in it.

843
01:07:48,457 --> 01:07:52,116
You really think you're gonna
be able to make that fly?

844
01:07:53,357 --> 01:07:56,414
Latasha Harlins, Rodney King.

845
01:07:56,523 --> 01:07:59,490
- These names ring a bell, Detective?
- Yeah, vaguely.

846
01:07:59,590 --> 01:08:05,080
We have attorneys for this slain
police officer camping in our offices.

847
01:08:05,191 --> 01:08:07,918
We have his mother
and a half dozen men of the cloth

848
01:08:08,024 --> 01:08:10,922
who swear that Lewis was one of
the twelve apostles of Christ.

849
01:08:11,024 --> 01:08:12,490
We have two black city councilmen

850
01:08:12,590 --> 01:08:15,852
and a congresswoman
who call on the hour, every hour,

851
01:08:15,957 --> 01:08:19,355
demanding to know what the district
attorney intends to do about this.

852
01:08:19,457 --> 01:08:22,480
And you want him to walk
into that press room

853
01:08:22,590 --> 01:08:25,647
and tell them all that
the situation is complicated?

854
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:32,323
Give us a minute.

855
01:08:33,957 --> 01:08:36,116
No problem.

856
01:08:43,623 --> 01:08:45,816
Who knows about the money?

857
01:08:45,924 --> 01:08:47,947
You gotta be kiddin' me.

858
01:08:48,057 --> 01:08:51,921
There are only two people
in this room.

859
01:08:52,024 --> 01:08:55,354
Myself, my partner,
Ferguson and Internal Affairs.

860
01:08:55,457 --> 01:08:57,945
- Jim Ferguson?
- Yeah.

861
01:09:02,523 --> 01:09:04,955
Okay. I guess
I don't see a problem.

862
01:09:05,057 --> 01:09:07,599
As it wasn't Lewis's car, the money
isn't clear evidence of any wrongdoing.

863
01:09:07,623 --> 01:09:10,589
And even if it was, we aren't going to
prosecute a dead man.

864
01:09:10,690 --> 01:09:15,146
Which means the money Internal Affairs
is holding can't be considered evidence.

865
01:09:15,257 --> 01:09:17,552
You can do this dance
if you want to,

866
01:09:17,657 --> 01:09:21,112
but I'm willing to bet when the
coroner's report comes back tomorrow

867
01:09:21,224 --> 01:09:24,190
it's going to say that Detective Lewis
was coked out of his head.

868
01:09:25,623 --> 01:09:27,089
Fucking black people, huh?

869
01:09:27,191 --> 01:09:29,248
What did you just say?

870
01:09:29,357 --> 01:09:31,323
I mean,

871
01:09:31,424 --> 01:09:33,946
I know all the sociological
reasons why per capita

872
01:09:34,057 --> 01:09:37,114
eight times more black men
are incarcerated than white men.

873
01:09:37,224 --> 01:09:41,088
Schools are a disgrace. Lack of
opportunity. Bias in the judicial system.

874
01:09:41,191 --> 01:09:43,157
All that stuff.
All that stuff!

875
01:09:43,257 --> 01:09:47,314
But still, it's gotta get to you,
on a gut level as a black man.

876
01:09:47,423 --> 01:09:50,356
They just can't keep their hands
out of the cookie jar.

877
01:09:55,057 --> 01:09:57,614
Of course, you and I know
that's not the truth.

878
01:09:57,723 --> 01:09:59,848
But that's the way
it always plays, doesn't it?

879
01:09:59,957 --> 01:10:03,390
And assholes like Lewis keep feeding
the flames. It's gotta get to you.

880
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:06,945
What did you say
you did for the D.A. Again?

881
01:10:07,057 --> 01:10:08,955
You coach ball down in Compton.
Am I right?

882
01:10:09,057 --> 01:10:10,989
Oh, please, don't do that.

883
01:10:11,090 --> 01:10:13,920
Don't act like you know
something about me, okay?

884
01:10:14,024 --> 01:10:17,979
What do you think those kids need... to
make them believe, to give them hope?

885
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:20,681
You think they need another
drug-dealing cop

886
01:10:20,790 --> 01:10:23,722
or do you think they need
a fallen black hero?

887
01:10:23,824 --> 01:10:28,415
Why don't you cut through the bullshit
and just tell me what it is you want.

888
01:10:30,423 --> 01:10:33,219
The D.A.'s squad loses
its lead investigator next month.

889
01:10:33,324 --> 01:10:37,188
Rick is quite adamant that his replacement
be a person of color.

890
01:10:37,291 --> 01:10:41,450
It's a high-profile position, and he wants
to send the right message to the community.

891
01:10:41,557 --> 01:10:45,217
And the right message is,
"Look at this black boy I just bought?"

892
01:10:45,324 --> 01:10:50,188
Well, fuck you very much.
But thanks for thinking of me.

893
01:10:50,291 --> 01:10:52,756
Actually we were thinking of you.

894
01:10:52,857 --> 01:10:56,051
Until we saw that.

895
01:10:56,157 --> 01:10:58,214
It's your brother's file.

896
01:10:58,324 --> 01:11:01,414
Twenty-something years old
and already three felonies.

897
01:11:01,523 --> 01:11:04,251
Three strikes law. Kid's going away
for life for stealing a car.

898
01:11:04,356 --> 01:11:07,016
Christ, that's a shitty law.

899
01:11:07,124 --> 01:11:09,056
There's a warrant in there.

900
01:11:09,157 --> 01:11:13,555
But still, hey, he had
every opportunity you had.

901
01:11:14,957 --> 01:11:18,287
Fucking black people, huh?

902
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:27,079
So all, uh... all I need to do
to make this disappear

903
01:11:27,191 --> 01:11:29,486
is to frame
a potentially innocent man?

904
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:32,886
What are you? The fucking defender
of all things white?

905
01:11:32,990 --> 01:11:36,717
We're talking about a white man
who shot three black men.

906
01:11:36,824 --> 01:11:41,552
And you're arguing with me that maybe
we're not being fair to him?

907
01:11:41,657 --> 01:11:44,589
You know what? Maybe you're right.
Maybe Lewis did provoke this.

908
01:11:44,690 --> 01:11:46,883
And maybe he got exactly
what was coming to him.

909
01:11:46,990 --> 01:11:49,979
Or maybe stoned or not,
just being a black man in the Valley

910
01:11:50,090 --> 01:11:52,385
was enough to get him killed.

911
01:11:52,490 --> 01:11:55,888
There was no one there to see who
shot first, so there is no way to know.

912
01:11:55,990 --> 01:12:00,116
Which means we
could get this wrong.

913
01:12:01,990 --> 01:12:05,047
Maybe that's what happened
with your brother. Maybe we got it wrong.

914
01:12:05,157 --> 01:12:09,555
Maybe Lewis isn't the only one
who deserves the benefit of the doubt.

915
01:12:09,657 --> 01:12:12,055
You're the one closest to all this.

916
01:12:12,157 --> 01:12:14,180
You need to tell us.

917
01:12:17,990 --> 01:12:20,421
What does your gut tell you?

918
01:12:33,157 --> 01:12:36,350
So? Graham?

919
01:12:36,456 --> 01:12:38,581
What do I tell 'em?

920
01:12:38,690 --> 01:12:42,588
You tell me, and I'll tell them.

921
01:12:49,224 --> 01:12:53,383
Well, I think given
Detective Conklin's history,

922
01:12:53,490 --> 01:12:56,513
it's pretty clear
what happened last night.

923
01:12:56,623 --> 01:12:59,282
Okay.

924
01:13:15,890 --> 01:13:18,152
Before I get to why we're here,

925
01:13:18,256 --> 01:13:22,189
I know that many of you have heard we had
our car stolen last night.

926
01:13:22,290 --> 01:13:26,655
And as you could imagine, my wife and I
are both pretty shaken up.

927
01:13:26,757 --> 01:13:28,586
But we're okay.

928
01:13:28,690 --> 01:13:33,315
And Jean and I truly appreciate all
your calls and your concern. Thank you.

929
01:13:33,423 --> 01:13:39,015
Now, just after 9.'00 p.m. Last night,
Detective William Lewis,

930
01:13:39,124 --> 01:13:41,833
an eight-year veteran of the force and an
active member of the black community,

931
01:13:41,857 --> 01:13:45,983
was gunned down
by a fellow officer.

932
01:14:43,824 --> 01:14:45,653
Get outta the car!

933
01:14:45,757 --> 01:14:48,222
Gimme the keys!
Get out... What the fuck?

934
01:14:50,223 --> 01:14:52,246
Whoa! What the fuck
are you doing, man?

935
01:14:52,356 --> 01:14:54,219
Shit! You wanna get killed, nigger?

936
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:57,221
Say that again!

937
01:14:57,323 --> 01:14:59,585
- Say that again!
- You stupid motherfucker!

938
01:14:59,690 --> 01:15:02,986
Say it again, huh!
Call me a nigger again!

939
01:15:03,090 --> 01:15:05,453
- Man, what the fuck? Get off!
- Fuck you!

940
01:15:05,557 --> 01:15:08,318
- Shoot him!
- I'll blow your head off!

941
01:15:08,423 --> 01:15:11,480
- Shoot this motherfucker!
- I swear to God, I'm gonna blow your head off!

942
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:14,056
Stop talkin' and shoot!

943
01:15:14,156 --> 01:15:17,021
- Stop! Let's go! Here comes the po-po.
- Get off of me!

944
01:15:19,123 --> 01:15:21,885
Hey, hey! Where you goin', man? Hell, no!

945
01:15:21,990 --> 01:15:23,956
- Oh, shit.
- Anthony! Anthony!

946
01:15:26,323 --> 01:15:27,789
Get the fuck outta my car!

947
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:30,151
Shit! Damn!

948
01:15:30,256 --> 01:15:32,496
- What are you doin', man? Get outta the car!
- Fuck you!

949
01:15:36,423 --> 01:15:40,378
Car 25 in pursuit of a black Navigator.
West bound.

950
01:15:45,990 --> 01:15:50,319
2-2 Ida Tom Adam 3...
Oh, Christ!

951
01:15:55,890 --> 01:15:58,166
- Get the fuck outta the car!
- You get the fuck outta the car!

952
01:15:58,190 --> 01:16:00,622
- Get outta the fucking car!
- It's my fucking car!

953
01:16:00,723 --> 01:16:03,086
- It's my fucking gun!
- Fuck, it's my gun now!

954
01:16:03,190 --> 01:16:05,383
Gimme my fucking gun!

955
01:16:12,545 --> 01:16:14,340
Fuck!

956
01:16:16,078 --> 01:16:20,011
Hands in plain sight!
Step out of the vehicle!

957
01:16:22,878 --> 01:16:26,901
Hands in plain sight!
Step out of the vehicle!

958
01:16:30,178 --> 01:16:32,736
Slowly step out of the vehicle.

959
01:16:32,845 --> 01:16:36,538
- Get out of my car.
- You so brave, you get outta the car, man.

960
01:16:39,611 --> 01:16:43,407
Turn off the engine.
Throw the keys out the window.

961
01:16:56,044 --> 01:16:59,442
You fucking want me?
Here I am, you pig fuck!

962
01:16:59,545 --> 01:17:01,010
Lie face down on the ground.

963
01:17:01,111 --> 01:17:03,577
- Spread your arms and legs.
- No, you lie face down!

964
01:17:03,678 --> 01:17:05,871
Don't come any closer!
Down on your knees!

965
01:17:05,977 --> 01:17:08,375
Fuck you! What are you gonna do?
Pull the fucking trigger!

966
01:17:08,478 --> 01:17:09,478
On your knees now!

967
01:17:09,545 --> 01:17:12,238
You get on your knees
and suck my fucking dick!

968
01:17:12,344 --> 01:17:15,139
Do I look like
I'm fucking joking with you?

969
01:17:15,244 --> 01:17:16,888
That's what you look like,
a fucking joke to me.

970
01:17:16,912 --> 01:17:19,187
- This man is making threatening gestures.
- Threatening gestures?

971
01:17:19,211 --> 01:17:21,621
You wanna see a threatening gesture?
I got a threatening gesture.

972
01:17:21,645 --> 01:17:25,338
- I know this man! I know this man!
- Get back.

973
01:17:25,445 --> 01:17:27,967
- Give me some space. I know this guy.
- Get outta the way.

974
01:17:28,078 --> 01:17:29,203
Step away.

975
01:17:29,311 --> 01:17:31,300
Give me some goddamn room.
I know this guy.

976
01:17:33,178 --> 01:17:35,736
- Man, don't walk up on me!
- See what's happening here?

977
01:17:35,845 --> 01:17:38,037
Do you wanna die here, huh?
Is that what you want?

978
01:17:38,144 --> 01:17:40,076
'Cause these guys
really wanna shoot you.

979
01:17:40,178 --> 01:17:42,818
And the way you're acting,
they'll be completely fucking justified.

980
01:17:42,878 --> 01:17:44,036
Fuck you!

981
01:17:44,144 --> 01:17:47,304
Fuck me? I'm not the one who's fucked here.
You're the one.

982
01:17:47,411 --> 01:17:49,639
'Cause you're the one whose head's
gonna be blown off

983
01:17:49,745 --> 01:17:51,985
- and onto that man's patio.
- Officer Hanson, step away.

984
01:17:52,178 --> 01:17:55,440
He's a friend of mine, okay? He's a
fucking friend! This man is not armed!

985
01:17:55,545 --> 01:17:58,443
He's not gonna shoot you, me,
or anybody else, all right?

986
01:17:58,545 --> 01:18:00,636
So give me two goddamn seconds.
Can you do that?

987
01:18:00,745 --> 01:18:04,006
Lower your firearm.
Lower your firearm!

988
01:18:09,144 --> 01:18:12,406
You startin' to understand
the situation?

989
01:18:12,511 --> 01:18:15,238
What do you want from me?

990
01:18:15,344 --> 01:18:19,868
Unless you think your wife is better off with
a husband who has a bloody stump for a head,

991
01:18:19,977 --> 01:18:21,953
I want you to sit on that curb,
put your hands on your head

992
01:18:21,977 --> 01:18:24,205
and do nothing until I speak
with these officers.

993
01:18:24,311 --> 01:18:27,277
I'm not sittin' on no curb, I'm not puttin'
my hands on my head for nobody.

994
01:18:27,378 --> 01:18:31,401
Then stand where you are and keep your
hands in sight. Can you do that, huh?

995
01:18:34,478 --> 01:18:36,603
Yeah, I can do that.

996
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:38,973
Good.

997
01:18:39,078 --> 01:18:42,875
I told this man to stay where he is
and keep his hands in plain sight.

998
01:18:42,977 --> 01:18:47,740
This man better be related to you by blood
because this is fucking nuts.

999
01:18:47,845 --> 01:18:49,935
I need this favor.

1000
01:18:50,044 --> 01:18:54,067
You can check the guy's name, his license.
He's got no priors, no warrants.

1001
01:18:54,178 --> 01:18:56,736
I need to let him go
with a warning.

1002
01:18:56,845 --> 01:19:01,777
- What kind of fucking warning?
- A harsh warning.

1003
01:19:04,344 --> 01:19:06,207
Thank you.

1004
01:19:09,011 --> 01:19:13,068
You've been warned. Do you understand me?
Do you understand me!

1005
01:19:13,178 --> 01:19:16,440
You want something from me?
'Cause I'm right here.

1006
01:19:16,545 --> 01:19:20,602
- I'm trying to help you.
- I didn't ask for your help, did I?

1007
01:19:22,745 --> 01:19:24,937
Go home.

1008
01:19:28,578 --> 01:19:30,907
Yeah, that I can do.

1009
01:20:49,344 --> 01:20:51,242
Look at me.

1010
01:20:52,712 --> 01:20:55,371
You embarrass me.

1011
01:20:55,478 --> 01:20:57,569
You embarrass yourself.

1012
01:21:40,178 --> 01:21:41,667
Daddy's home!

1013
01:22:01,578 --> 01:22:03,601
- What's up?
- Give me my money!

1014
01:22:03,711 --> 01:22:06,143
- What? What money?
- Daddy!

1015
01:22:06,244 --> 01:22:09,540
- To pay for my store. Give me my money!
- Honey, stay inside. Elizabeth!

1016
01:22:09,645 --> 01:22:10,940
Give me my money!

1017
01:22:12,611 --> 01:22:15,770
- I want my fucking money! Give me that truck!
- That's not my truck!

1018
01:22:15,877 --> 01:22:18,207
- Daddy?
- Elizabeth!

1019
01:22:18,311 --> 01:22:22,573
Hey, you know what?
Hey, I got $50. Here.

1020
01:22:22,677 --> 01:22:24,973
Fifty dollars?
You took everything!

1021
01:22:25,078 --> 01:22:28,874
- Mommy?
- I'm coming, I'm coming!

1022
01:22:28,977 --> 01:22:33,239
- He doesn't have it.
- Hasn't got what?

1023
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:38,572
I have it. He doesn't
have the impenetrable cloak!

1024
01:22:38,677 --> 01:22:40,337
Lara, stay outta the street!

1025
01:23:07,911 --> 01:23:11,605
- It's okay, Daddy.
- What... What?

1026
01:23:11,711 --> 01:23:13,177
I'll protect you.

1027
01:23:40,411 --> 01:23:43,104
It's okay. Daddy's okay.

1028
01:23:43,211 --> 01:23:46,200
It's a really good cloak.

1029
01:25:07,344 --> 01:25:09,071
How's it goin'

1030
01:25:34,844 --> 01:25:39,799
I sent her out for groceries,
and that was two hours ago, Carol.

1031
01:25:39,911 --> 01:25:41,843
Well, you are one to talk.

1032
01:25:41,944 --> 01:25:45,808
You go through, like,
six housekeepers a year?

1033
01:25:45,911 --> 01:25:49,241
I'm not snapping at you!
I am angry.

1034
01:25:50,510 --> 01:25:52,567
Yes! At them! Yes!

1035
01:25:52,677 --> 01:25:57,007
At them, the police,
at Rick, at Maria,

1036
01:25:57,111 --> 01:26:00,804
at the dry cleaners
who destroyed another blouse today,

1037
01:26:00,911 --> 01:26:04,604
at the gardener who keeps
over-watering the lawn.

1038
01:26:04,711 --> 01:26:05,711
I...

1039
01:26:07,378 --> 01:26:09,900
I just thought that...

1040
01:26:10,011 --> 01:26:13,602
Carol, I just thought that
I would wake up today

1041
01:26:13,711 --> 01:26:16,677
and I would feel better,
you know?

1042
01:26:16,777 --> 01:26:20,766
But I was still mad.
And I realized...

1043
01:26:20,877 --> 01:26:24,775
I realized that it had nothing to do
with my car being stolen.

1044
01:26:26,811 --> 01:26:30,573
I wake up like this
every morning!

1045
01:26:30,677 --> 01:26:34,632
I am angry all the time,
and I don't know why.

1046
01:26:34,744 --> 01:26:38,074
Carol, I don't know why!
And I...

1047
01:26:39,744 --> 01:26:42,869
Yeah, yeah, call me back.

1048
01:26:42,977 --> 01:26:44,840
Bye.

1049
01:28:35,844 --> 01:28:37,707
Really appreciate this.

1050
01:28:37,811 --> 01:28:40,073
No problem.

1051
01:28:45,911 --> 01:28:47,853
So how long you been
out there tonight? It's cold.

1052
01:28:47,877 --> 01:28:50,070
Hour maybe.

1053
01:28:50,178 --> 01:28:51,871
Big surprise, huh?

1054
01:28:51,977 --> 01:28:55,239
Yeah, this ain't exactly
"pick up a brother" territory.

1055
01:28:55,343 --> 01:28:57,105
True.

1056
01:28:57,211 --> 01:28:59,234
So where you headed?

1057
01:28:59,343 --> 01:29:01,468
Anywhere the other side
of the hill.

1058
01:29:01,577 --> 01:29:03,372
I'm goin' to El Segundo.

1059
01:29:03,477 --> 01:29:05,807
El Segundo's cool.

1060
01:29:05,911 --> 01:29:07,104
You've been there?

1061
01:29:07,211 --> 01:29:09,109
Fuck no.

1062
01:29:15,410 --> 01:29:16,967
That's some good music.

1063
01:29:20,610 --> 01:29:23,008
No, really. I'm startin'
to understand it.

1064
01:29:23,977 --> 01:29:27,171
Wrote me a country song
myself just yesterday.

1065
01:29:27,277 --> 01:29:29,573
I'll bet you did.

1066
01:29:30,977 --> 01:29:32,875
Whatever.

1067
01:29:46,777 --> 01:29:49,141
So what was goin' on
in the Valley tonight?

1068
01:29:49,243 --> 01:29:50,903
Ice-skatin'

1069
01:29:52,011 --> 01:29:53,170
Ice-skatin'

1070
01:29:53,277 --> 01:29:55,835
Love the ice-skatin'

1071
01:29:55,944 --> 01:29:59,569
When I was a kid, I always
wanted to be a goalie.

1072
01:29:59,677 --> 01:30:01,267
Come on!

1073
01:30:01,377 --> 01:30:04,639
What, you... you think
that's funny or somethin'

1074
01:30:04,744 --> 01:30:06,710
I think you're having fun.

1075
01:30:06,811 --> 01:30:08,800
Yeah. Whatever.

1076
01:30:18,544 --> 01:30:19,635
Something else funny?

1077
01:30:19,744 --> 01:30:21,972
Oh, yeah.

1078
01:30:24,277 --> 01:30:26,209
Yeah? What's that?

1079
01:30:26,310 --> 01:30:27,936
People, man. People.

1080
01:30:29,111 --> 01:30:31,077
People like me.

1081
01:30:31,177 --> 01:30:34,541
No, no, no.
I'm not laughin' at you, man.

1082
01:30:35,644 --> 01:30:37,200
Yeah, I can see that.

1083
01:30:37,310 --> 01:30:40,970
- Why don't you laugh outside?
- Why are you gettin' all bent outta shape?

1084
01:30:41,078 --> 01:30:43,737
I'm not gettin' bent, man.
Just pulling over.

1085
01:30:46,343 --> 01:30:50,435
Come on, man, keep drivin'
I said I'm not laughing at you.

1086
01:30:50,544 --> 01:30:52,908
And I'm not telling you
to get the fuck out of my car.

1087
01:30:53,011 --> 01:30:55,636
Why you bein' a fucking jerk?
Just drive the car.

1088
01:30:55,744 --> 01:30:57,607
I've got a better idea.
Get out now.

1089
01:30:57,711 --> 01:30:59,420
Fine. You want me
to show you? I'll show you.

1090
01:30:59,444 --> 01:31:02,153
Get your hands out of your pocket.
Put your hands where I can see 'em.

1091
01:31:02,177 --> 01:31:04,286
- Who the fuck you think you're talkin' to?
- Put your hands where I can see!

1092
01:31:04,310 --> 01:31:07,270
You wanna see what's in my hands?
I'll show you what's in my fuckin' hands!

1093
01:31:32,477 --> 01:31:34,068
Oh, God.

1094
01:31:43,343 --> 01:31:44,866
Oh, God.

1095
01:32:20,510 --> 01:32:24,909
Thank you, Brother Merle.
That was Merle Haggard on KYHA.

1096
01:32:25,011 --> 01:32:27,101
The scene of country music
here in L.A.

1097
01:32:27,210 --> 01:32:29,403
It's a cold night,
and it's getting colder.

1098
01:32:29,510 --> 01:32:33,499
We're giving out tickets to the rodeo
coming to the Fairplex in Pomona.

1099
01:32:37,043 --> 01:32:41,271
- Hey, you okay?
- I'm freezin'

1100
01:32:41,377 --> 01:32:44,343
Shit. I heard
it might snow.

1101
01:32:44,444 --> 01:32:46,774
- Get outta here.
- That's what I heard.

1102
01:32:46,877 --> 01:32:50,138
- You got a smoke?
- Nah. I quit.

1103
01:32:50,243 --> 01:32:52,402
Yeah, me too.

1104
01:32:52,510 --> 01:32:55,067
- What do you got?
- Dead kid.

1105
01:32:57,877 --> 01:33:00,365
Hey, Bob.

1106
01:34:27,310 --> 01:34:30,299
Choi Jin Gui! Choi Jin Gui!

1107
01:34:30,410 --> 01:34:33,376
- Choi Jin Gui! Choi Jin Gui!
- Do you speak English?

1108
01:34:33,477 --> 01:34:37,466
I am speaking English, you stupid cow!
My husband name Choi Jin Gui!

1109
01:34:39,711 --> 01:34:41,233
- Jin Gui!
- Ma'am!

1110
01:34:41,343 --> 01:34:44,571
Kim Lee.

1111
01:34:50,477 --> 01:34:53,307
I thought you were dead.
I called every hospital.

1112
01:34:53,410 --> 01:34:57,604
It's okay. I'm okay.

1113
01:34:57,711 --> 01:35:00,871
I went crazy speeding.
I drove into car.

1114
01:35:00,976 --> 01:35:02,840
My God. Are you okay?

1115
01:35:02,943 --> 01:35:05,501
I got into big fight
with poor woman.

1116
01:35:05,610 --> 01:35:07,132
I called her names.

1117
01:35:08,343 --> 01:35:10,605
Oh, fine.
I die from worry

1118
01:35:10,711 --> 01:35:12,768
and you laugh.

1119
01:35:15,277 --> 01:35:17,175
Thank you for finding me.

1120
01:35:19,877 --> 01:35:24,036
- Will you do something for me?
- Anything.

1121
01:35:24,143 --> 01:35:27,473
Go to the locker.

1122
01:35:30,110 --> 01:35:32,042
No, next one.

1123
01:35:35,110 --> 01:35:37,871
In my wallet, there's a check.

1124
01:35:37,976 --> 01:35:40,067
Bring it here.

1125
01:35:48,110 --> 01:35:51,338
Oh, I get it. When I said get me
a black Lincoln Navigator,

1126
01:35:51,444 --> 01:35:54,808
you thought I said get me
a white piece of shit panel van.

1127
01:35:54,910 --> 01:35:59,933
- Fine, fine. Just give me whatever for it.
- You should see this.

1128
01:36:16,077 --> 01:36:17,975
I'll take the van.

1129
01:36:18,077 --> 01:36:20,305
They're chained to the van.

1130
01:36:20,410 --> 01:36:22,069
So I'll take them too.

1131
01:36:23,477 --> 01:36:25,500
You wanna buy these Chinamen?

1132
01:36:25,610 --> 01:36:27,667
Don't be ignorant.
They're Thai or Cambodian.

1133
01:36:27,777 --> 01:36:29,935
Entirely different kind of chinks.

1134
01:36:30,043 --> 01:36:33,168
- What the hell are you gonna do with 'em?
- Sell 'em. What you think?

1135
01:36:33,277 --> 01:36:37,607
I'll give you 500 apiece,
and you can keep the van.

1136
01:36:55,711 --> 01:36:58,643
Oh, no!

1137
01:37:02,410 --> 01:37:04,672
No! No!

1138
01:37:20,876 --> 01:37:22,740
This is Dorri.

1139
01:37:35,210 --> 01:37:39,404
My baby. My poor baby!

1140
01:37:41,677 --> 01:37:44,142
Mom.

1141
01:37:44,243 --> 01:37:48,902
I promise you... I promise I'm gonna
find out who did this, Mom.

1142
01:37:50,810 --> 01:37:53,572
Oh, I already know.

1143
01:37:55,544 --> 01:37:57,271
You did.

1144
01:37:59,610 --> 01:38:04,235
I asked you to find your brother,
but you were busy.

1145
01:38:04,343 --> 01:38:08,139
We weren't much good
to you anymore, were we?

1146
01:38:12,577 --> 01:38:15,600
You got things to do.
You go ahead. I'll sign the papers.

1147
01:38:15,710 --> 01:38:17,540
I wanna stay.

1148
01:38:17,644 --> 01:38:21,303
I just wanna wait with my baby.

1149
01:38:31,143 --> 01:38:32,938
He came home.

1150
01:38:33,043 --> 01:38:35,941
Did you know that?

1151
01:38:36,043 --> 01:38:38,873
My little boy.

1152
01:38:38,976 --> 01:38:40,771
When I was sleepin',

1153
01:38:40,876 --> 01:38:43,933
he brought me groceries.

1154
01:38:44,043 --> 01:38:46,032
It's the last thing he did.

1155
01:39:25,343 --> 01:39:27,332
What happened?

1156
01:39:33,843 --> 01:39:35,706
What did you do?

1157
01:39:36,810 --> 01:39:39,368
What did you do?

1158
01:39:41,544 --> 01:39:43,442
I shoot a little girl.

1159
01:39:43,544 --> 01:39:45,771
What?

1160
01:39:45,876 --> 01:39:48,706
No, she's okay. She's...

1161
01:39:50,343 --> 01:39:52,468
She's... Here.

1162
01:39:52,577 --> 01:39:57,804
The gun shoot her,
but she's okay, Dorri.

1163
01:39:57,910 --> 01:40:00,899
Nothing happened.

1164
01:40:02,609 --> 01:40:03,768
She's my...

1165
01:40:05,477 --> 01:40:07,272
What are you
talking about, Daddy?

1166
01:40:11,077 --> 01:40:12,872
My angel.

1167
01:40:15,010 --> 01:40:16,942
My angel!

1168
01:40:18,743 --> 01:40:21,369
She came to protect me.

1169
01:40:22,676 --> 01:40:25,074
To protect us!

1170
01:40:26,810 --> 01:40:28,605
You understand?

1171
01:40:32,943 --> 01:40:34,966
Take this. Please.

1172
01:40:36,544 --> 01:40:38,442
Take it.

1173
01:40:42,810 --> 01:40:45,368
Hey! Hey!

1174
01:40:45,477 --> 01:40:49,034
Everything is okay, Dorri.

1175
01:40:49,143 --> 01:40:50,870
It's okay.

1176
01:40:55,910 --> 01:40:57,536
Okay, Daddy.

1177
01:40:57,643 --> 01:40:59,234
Okay.

1178
01:41:22,377 --> 01:41:23,672
Jean?

1179
01:41:23,776 --> 01:41:25,799
- Rick?
- Yeah. What's wrong.

1180
01:41:25,910 --> 01:41:28,603
I fell down the stairs.

1181
01:41:28,710 --> 01:41:32,040
- Are you all right?
- I tried calling you.

1182
01:41:32,143 --> 01:41:35,337
I couldn't get through
to anyone. Not...

1183
01:41:35,444 --> 01:41:38,876
Not Kath, not Marge, not Julie.

1184
01:41:38,976 --> 01:41:41,786
I'm getting in the elevator. I'll be in
my car. I'll be home in 20 minutes.

1185
01:41:41,810 --> 01:41:44,799
It's okay. Maria drove me to emergency.
It's just a bad sprain.

1186
01:41:44,910 --> 01:41:47,308
Carol was the only one
that was home and

1187
01:41:47,410 --> 01:41:51,069
she said she couldn't come get me
because she was getting a massage.

1188
01:41:51,177 --> 01:41:53,574
That's because she's a bitch.

1189
01:41:53,676 --> 01:41:57,608
She's been my friend for ten years.

1190
01:41:57,710 --> 01:41:59,573
All right, honey.
Feel better.

1191
01:41:59,676 --> 01:42:01,972
I'll be there soon.

1192
01:42:04,177 --> 01:42:06,075
I love you.

1193
01:42:06,177 --> 01:42:08,405
I love you too.

1194
01:42:40,676 --> 01:42:42,767
Miss Jean.

1195
01:42:44,810 --> 01:42:47,435
Would you like to sit up?

1196
01:42:53,110 --> 01:42:56,304
Here. Good!

1197
01:43:04,910 --> 01:43:07,103
Do you wanna hear
something funny?

1198
01:43:07,210 --> 01:43:09,142
What, Mrs. Jean?

1199
01:43:10,976 --> 01:43:13,771
You're the best friend I've got.

1200
01:46:26,710 --> 01:46:28,074
Hi.

1201
01:46:28,776 --> 01:46:30,264
Hi.

1202
01:46:36,077 --> 01:46:37,804
I love you.

1203
01:48:07,910 --> 01:48:09,773
All right.

1204
01:48:09,876 --> 01:48:13,239
Everybody out, man.
You're free to go.

1205
01:48:16,043 --> 01:48:18,406
All right, come on.

1206
01:48:18,509 --> 01:48:21,964
Come on now! This is America.
Time is money. Chop, chop!

1207
01:48:22,077 --> 01:48:23,542
Come on, y'all.

1208
01:48:26,843 --> 01:48:28,604
Come on.

1209
01:49:05,209 --> 01:49:07,300
That's $40.

1210
01:49:07,409 --> 01:49:10,341
Buy everybody chop suey.
You understand?

1211
01:49:11,743 --> 01:49:14,265
Dopey fucking Chinaman.

1212
01:49:49,810 --> 01:49:54,174
Oh, my God!
