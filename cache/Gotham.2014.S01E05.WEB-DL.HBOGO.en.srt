1
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,560
Fancy a stroll?

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,320
It's a lovely day.

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,160
Stretch the legs,
breath of fresh air.

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,320
I'm busy.

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,080
I got a question for you,
Master Bruce.

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,960
What if all of this

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,720
was a complete and utter
bloody waste of time?

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,880
What if you never discovered
who killed your mom and dad?

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,000
What if you never get
to wreak revenge?

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,400
I don't want revenge.

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,600
I wanna understand how it all works.

12
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,440
How Gotham works.

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,960
Well, you'd have more chance
digging to China with a teaspoon.

14
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,720
Take the Arkham project,
for instance.

15
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,720
How did the Falcone and Maroni
crime families

16
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,240
get such big shares in the deal?

17
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,200
I mean, I know city hall is corrupt,

18
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,240
but why didn't Wayne Enterprises
do something?

19
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,920
Can you pass me that blue folder,
over there?

20
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,880
Well, I suppose as hobbies go,
this is,

21
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,600
a damn sight better than grilling
yourself like a bloody pork chop.

22
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,480
Still, not particularly healthy,
is it?

23
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,560
Thank you.

24
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,440
Are you listening to me?

25
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,560
Yeah, yeah, for sure.
I'll take a walk later.

26
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,640
Thank you, Alfred.

27
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,120
I won a piece of Arkham.
I strong-armed the mayor,

28
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,760
I made Falcone back down,

29
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,320
and you're telling me
that I can't rob a lousy casino?

30
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,600
Sal, the casino is Falcone's
pride and joy.

31
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,840
I mean, what's the point?

32
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,080
For a few thousand bucks,
why mess with Falcone?

33
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,360
That's the point,

34
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,520
messing with Falcone.

35
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,840
I want him and his people to know
we're not backing off.

36
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,120
Arkham was only the beginning.

37
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,840
We're taking over, Frankie.
Inch by inch.

38
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,640
- Yeah, okay, but...
- "But, but, but."

39
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,560
- Make it happen.
- Okay, boss.

40
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,080
What are you looking at?
You got something to say?

41
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,000
No, sir. Nothing at all.

42
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,960
Hey.

43
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,760
Hey, man!

44
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,240
Hey.

45
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,680
Hey, you gotta pay for that.

46
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,880
Do not vex me, mortal.

47
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,200
Yeah?

48
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,640
Suit yourself, Zeus.

49
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,560
Hey, it might look like the heel
of a hobo's shoe.

50
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,760
Best burgers in midtown.

51
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,480
- Huh, Efram?
- If you say so.

52
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,480
All right. I want two cheeseburgers,
hold the sauce,

53
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,240
extra pickles, two malted shakes.

54
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,320
- No pickles on mine, please.
- Oh, you gotta trust me on this one.

55
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,280
- Yeah?
- All right, pickles.

56
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,360
Bring them.

57
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,120
Alright, now, you wanna look good
in a swimsuit like me,

58
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,720
come summertime, you'll want
a lot of this and lot of this.

59
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,800
All right.

60
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:06,840
Yeah.

61
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,280
- You!
- Hey!

62
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
Jim.

63
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,480
Jim! Come on, it's lunchtime. Relax.

64
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,920
It's lunchtime.

65
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,800
No, Jim. We're on our... It's lunch!

66
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,880
Oh, brother.

67
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:38,000
Jim, you can't just pop up and jump
every time you hear a bell.

68
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,600
G.C.P.D. Anybody here?

69
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,040
Over, over here.

70
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,240
You all right, sir? You okay?

71
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,320
- Thank God you're here.
- Anybody dead?

72
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,320
I don't think so.

73
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,640
Some guy, he was stealing milk.

74
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,640
I tried to stop him,
he hauls away my ATM machine.

75
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,560
All right, nobody dead.
We're Homicide, and it's lunch.

76
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,640
So have a good day, sir.

77
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,560
Call 911 and someone
will take care of you.

78
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,800
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

79
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,240
One guy did this?
Stole your ATM over milk?

80
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,640
Little skinny ass dude.

81
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,920
Guitar case.

82
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,240
Drinking milk
like there's no more cows.

83
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,560
"Don't vex me, mortal," he says.

84
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,640
I'm sorry, what?

85
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,440
Listen, if I had a dollar
for every hobo skeez

86
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,080
that walks through that door thinks
they're God, I wouldn't be here.

87
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,280
But this son of a bitch,
he wasn't fooling around.

88
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,360
All right.

89
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,880
You get a description of the vehicle,
license plate, something?

90
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,760
He didn't have a vehicle.

91
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,920
Then how'd he pull your ATM
from the wall?

92
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,480
- How'd he take it away?
- That's what I'm telling you, man.

93
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,720
He pulled it out of here
with his bare hands.

94
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,440
I'm bored.

95
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,040
{\an5}Poor little baby girl.

96
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,200
{\an5}Cooped up in here all the time.

97
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,280
{\an5}- You want some excitement.
- Yes, I do.

98
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,760
{\an5}Can we just go somewhere?

99
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,320
{\an5}How's that? Excited now?

100
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,720
- What'd you do that for?
- Why are you here with me?

101
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,360
{\an5}- I'm your secret weapon.
- Exactly.

102
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,240
{\an5}But are you helping me help you?

103
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,320
{\an5}No, you're not.

104
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,200
You won't even learn the damn tune.

105
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,400
{\an5}I told you this is important.

106
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,160
{\an5}- I'm sorry, Mama.
- I'm not your mama.

107
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,200
{\an5}Now, you might be my baby girl,
but I'm not your mama.

108
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,920
Not yet.

109
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,760
{\an5}You have to earn that.

110
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,960
{\an5}(Foreign Language)

111
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:09,160
{\an5}(Foreign Language)

112
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,600
How is that even possible?

113
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,800
Who is this guy?

114
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,040
{\an5}No positive ID as of yet.

115
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,280
{\an5}He's a street guy.

116
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,400
{\an5}We think that this thing
has something to do

117
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,360
{\an5}with his excessive <i>joie de vivre.</i>

118
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,360
{\an5}Yeah, we found it in the suspect's
guitar case. It's some drug.

119
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,440
{\an5}A drug did that?

120
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,520
{\an5}- Wow.
- Nygma found traces of the drug.

121
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,840
{\an5}He'll have a read on what the hell
this thing is by tomorrow morning.

122
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,720
{\an5}Meantime, we'll try and ID
the strong man.

123
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,800
{\an5}Yeah.

124
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,720
I know your families are upset

125
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,920
{\an5}but tell them everybody got
a piece of the Arkham project.

126
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,720
It was a business decision.

127
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,520
We didn't lose, Maroni didn't win.

128
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,400
Maroni thinks he won.

129
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,120
He thinks he won a great battle.

130
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,880
- We need to hurt him.
- No.

131
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,320
If we don't push back hard,
he's going to think...

132
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,960
Nikolai, that fool will think
what I want him to think.

133
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,440
No pushback, not yet.

134
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:28,040
In my country, we say,
"Even a fool may bite the king,

135
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,640
if he has teeth."

136
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,840
Can the folklore, Niko.

137
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,120
We're not in your godforsaken
country.

138
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,680
We are here in Gotham
where we have plumbing,

139
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,080
electricity, and Don Falcone
is the boss.

140
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,280
He's playing that cluck Maroni
on a long line. Done.

141
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,680
Why so angry, Fish?

142
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,680
I speak my mind. Is no crime.

143
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,480
And I assure you in my country,
we have all modern conveniences.

144
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,080
Only difference, ladies.

145
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,080
Ladies are in kitchen or in bed,
depending on their talents.

146
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,160
I bet your mother was a lousy cook.

147
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,880
- Don't speak of my mother.
- Or what?

148
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,880
You're gonna hit a lady?

149
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,120
That's enough.

150
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,560
There'll be no bad blood here.

151
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,520
My apologies, Don Falcone.

152
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,320
We need each other.

153
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,400
We're family.

154
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,960
Hey.

155
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,880
Excuse me.

156
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,240
- You seen this guy by chance?
- No.

157
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,280
Seen this guy?

158
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,280
Excuse me.

159
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,560
Familiar to you?

160
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,480
Any chance you seen this guy?

161
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,680
Yeah, I know him. It's Benny.

162
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,120
He's a guitar player.

163
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,440
Strung out like a string.

164
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,480
- What'd he do?
- Nothing bad.

165
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,840
He came into an inheritance
actually no one knew about.

166
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,120
That's right. A million dollars.

167
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,600
Farm, horses, real nice.

168
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,720
You know where we can find him?

169
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,760
20 dollars.

170
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,880
Ten.

171
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,400
Same as the bodega.

172
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,280
Yeah, what's with
all the dairy products?

173
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,920
Sir, G.C.P.D. Let me see those hands.

174
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,120
Help me.

175
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,120
I need more.

176
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,600
More what? What'd you take?
What is it?

177
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,920
It felt so good.

178
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,560
And now I don't feel so good.
Something's wrong.

179
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,960
I need more. Please.

180
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,160
You have to find him.

181
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,800
Find who?

182
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,320
- The guy that gave you the stuff?
- Yeah.

183
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,080
The man with a mangled ear.

184
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,000
With a mangled ear. Go ahead.

185
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,440
Stay calm, we got it.
We're gonna help.

186
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,960
- Just put your...
- No, no, no.

187
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,240
Hey, hey! Sir!

188
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,040
Sir, we need you to calm down.

189
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,120
- Calm down.
- Put your hands behind your back!

190
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,640
- I said no.
- Put it down!

191
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,240
What the hell?

192
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,840
God help us if that drug gets out.

193
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,880
Will you look at this shambles?

194
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,960
What would your mother say?

195
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,560
You know, I have half a mind

196
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,240
to stick all this lot
straight into the bloody fire.

197
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,640
- No fire.
- We'll see about that.

198
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,720
Come on. Up you get.

199
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,760
Wayne Enterprises is hosting
a charitable luncheon tomorrow.

200
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,240
I took the liberty of accepting
their kind invitation

201
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,200
- on your behalf, Master Bruce.
- Good.

202
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,800
Is there breakfast?

203
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,880
Yeah, I'll make you an egg.

204
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,240
Does that mean you'll go?

205
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,560
Yes.

206
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,720
I have some questions I need
to ask the members of the board.

207
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,520
- What kind of questions?
- About Arkham.

208
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,120
It seems very likely those gangsters
were actually given their shares

209
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,320
in Arkham by Wayne Enterprises.

210
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,960
Well, that's how business is done,
isn't it?

211
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:57,840
Is it?

212
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,600
My parents didn't do business
that way, did they?

213
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,640
No.

214
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,720
No, they didn't, Master Bruce.

215
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,920
The board might not know, of course.

216
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,080
There's quite a bit of clever
camouflage used.

217
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,200
Shell companies, offshore accounts
and so forth.

218
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:19,840
Right. So, you learned all
of that from all of this, did you?

219
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,320
Fantastic detective work.

220
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,360
I still want to get the whole lot
and chuck it straight in the fire.

221
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,200
Don't put anything in the fire,
Alfred.

222
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
That's an order.

223
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,920
Right, Master Bruce.

224
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,240
Nothing in the fire.

225
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,920
<i>We are live in downtown Gotham</i>

226
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,880
<i>where a deadly new drug
has hit the streets.</i>

227
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,200
<i>Nicknamed Viper,
users of this mystery drug</i>

228
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,240
{\an5}<i>acquire great strength
and a euphoric sense of power,</i>

229
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,440
{\an5}<i>but only for a few brief hours.</i>

230
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,840
{\an5}<i>Then without exception,
they die a horrible death.</i>

231
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,400
Let me out!

232
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,680
Get off me!

233
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,760
Let go of me!

234
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,800
Get your crummy hands off me!

235
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,160
It's really quite remarkable.

236
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,480
Viper somehow activates unused DNA.

237
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,480
The body starts to burn calcium
from the skeletal system as fuel,

238
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,960
hence the victims' cravings
for milk and cheese.

239
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,640
They're desperately trying
to replace the missing calcium,

240
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,360
but they can't consume enough.

241
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:53,440
Essentially their bones crumble,
then they suffocate and die.

242
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,080
Have you seen anything
like this before?

243
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,000
No, nobody has. Totally new.

244
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,880
I can't tell you how thrilled I am
to be...

245
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,800
No new reports for a few hours now.

246
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,320
Maybe they're done.
Maybe they ran out of the stuff.

247
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,400
I doubt it.

248
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,480
Who would put this on the street?
Why?

249
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,840
They're not even selling it,
they're giving it away.

250
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,280
That's how you create demand.

251
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,800
For a drug that kills you that fast?

252
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,400
First, it makes you king
of the world.

253
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,560
There'll be takers.

254
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,000
There'll be mayhem that's for sure.

255
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,480
But it's skell-on-skell mayhem.

256
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,120
If we keep the decent citizens
indoors for a couple of weeks,

257
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,320
let the scumbags have at it?

258
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,360
Voilà, the end of crime.

259
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,720
Yeah, that's a nice thought, but no.

260
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,840
This stuff seems hard to make, no?

261
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,720
It takes a high level
of technical sophistication.

262
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,520
A state-of-the-art lab
made this stuff.

263
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,160
Okay, so who has the biggest
and best lab in the city?

264
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,120
The best is WellZyn.

265
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,480
But this is not them.

266
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,560
They're a subsidiary
of Wayne Enterprises.

267
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,920
Multibillion dollar corporation.

268
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,040
Why would they do this?

269
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,400
I don't know. But we might
as well start at the top.

270
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,880
Grab her! Grab her!

271
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,200
Let go of me. Get off me!

272
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,160
Get off me!

273
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,880
Fascinating.

274
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,440
Fascinating.

275
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,520
<i>Breaking news. Continued mayhem...</i>

276
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,920
Maybe I should hire that guy
to take the casino.

277
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,680
Maybe you should snort some Viper.

278
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,200
Either way, I want that casino taken.

279
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,480
Sure, we'll take it.

280
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,240
I mean, it's tight as a nut.

281
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,320
Ten armed guards,
blast-proof doors, cameras.

282
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,280
We're gonna lose a few guys,
but we'll take it.

283
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,920
Excuse me, gentlemen.

284
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,760
I couldn't help but overhear
your conversation

285
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,840
regarding the casino.

286
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,440
Go mind your business.

287
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,440
I'm sorry. Of course. So sorry.

288
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,400
No. Tell me, what about the casino?

289
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,880
I know a janitor who runs
the boiler room of the casino.

290
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,040
He could get you inside
quite easily, I believe.

291
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,320
There are access tunnels
that nobody knows about.

292
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,760
Access tunnels?

293
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,640
Sit down. Come here.

294
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,560
Thank you, sir. A great honor indeed.

295
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,960
What's your name again?

296
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,160
Everyone here calls me Penguin, sir.

297
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,280
You don't like that name, huh?

298
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,160
Yeah, well, you're wrong.

299
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,080
It's a good name.

300
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,880
Works for you.

301
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,160
So, how do you know this man?
The janitor?

302
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,280
I have connections.

303
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,160
Reliable, is he?

304
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,320
I think I can persuade him to be.

305
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,560
Boss, this guy is a dishwasher
in a suit...

306
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,640
Relax.

307
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,800
Is that right, Penguin?

308
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,000
Are you just a dishwasher?

309
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,600
'Cause I don't get that vibe.

310
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,160
You come off as all humble, but...

311
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,440
you got a little player in you, huh?

312
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,880
That's very perceptive of you, sir.

313
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,480
I guess that's why you're the don.

314
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,560
Well...

315
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,320
I'm not a dishwasher.

316
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,440
And this isn't my first rodeo,
so to speak.

317
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,320
So, you've rode some bulls, huh?

318
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,480
- Well...
- I knew it.

319
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,240
Well, tell all, cowboy.

320
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,400
Well, my real name
is Oswald Cobblepot.

321
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,120
And I think that once you hear
my story,

322
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,440
you'll agree that I could be
a great asset for you, sir.

323
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,760
It's a long, funny story really.

324
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,640
But the headline,
just so you're not surprised...

325
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,800
I used to work for Fish Mooney.

326
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,880
Fish Mooney?

327
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,760
- Hey.
- Yes, sir.

328
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,640
I was privy to many aspects
of the Falcone family business.

329
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,360
- Until they tried to kill me.
- Yeah.

330
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,160
Hello.

331
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,240
Suffice it to say...

332
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,200
That is a funny story.

333
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,800
I'm Taylor Reece,

334
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,280
general counsel,
public relations for WellZyn.

335
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,200
Good morning, gentlemen.

336
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,640
Thank you for saving us a trip.

337
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,720
We were en route as soon as we
were apprised of your inquiries.

338
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,240
WellZyn is committed
to good community relations.

339
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,400
What do you know about Viper?

340
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,840
Only what we see on the news.

341
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:06,000
WellZyn has no connection
to this tragedy.

342
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,560
We will vigorously pursue

343
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,880
legal action against any individuals
making assertions to the contrary.

344
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,160
Do you think we push a button

345
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,960
or does she just rewind
automatically?

346
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,680
We're looking for
an employee of WellZyn's.

347
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,720
Male with a severely damaged ear.

348
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,440
Yes. Full disclosure,
that does raise a flag.

349
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,560
That's Stan Potolsky.

350
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,880
He worked for us for several years
as a biochemist.

351
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,480
Primarily personal care products.

352
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,760
Shampoos, toothpastes.

353
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:45,840
So what happened?

354
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:50,200
Well, Stan was frustrated that
he wasn't doing more important work.

355
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,160
He grew disgruntled and unstable.

356
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,080
We tried to get him help,
but he resisted.

357
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,800
Last April, there was an incident.

358
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,760
He tried to cut off his own ear

359
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:06,080
during a disagreement
with his supervisor.

360
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,320
Guess it was harder than he thought.

361
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,440
We had to let him go.

362
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,560
Last known address?

363
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,200
Well, after he was terminated,
he didn't even clear off his desk.

364
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,000
Just disappeared, off the grid.

365
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,640
You knew, didn't you?

366
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,200
You knew all along it was him.

367
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,840
That's why you came to see us
so fast.

368
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:26,680
That's incorrect.

369
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,240
Viper can only be produced
in a state-of-the-art lab,

370
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,280
like yours.

371
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,560
Stan Potolsky is a brilliant man,

372
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,800
perfectly capable of building
his own lab.

373
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,360
But you are more than welcome
to examine our facilities.

374
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,840
With full and proper clearances,
of course.

375
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,840
Of course.

376
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,160
We'll get the paperwork started.

377
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,440
Lawyers. Scumbags, the lot of them.

378
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,920
Yeah, some of them.

379
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,280
Let's go find Stan Potolsky.

380
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,800
What, drive around looking for him?

381
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,360
No. I'll call dispatch,
have them put out an APB.

382
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,640
All right, I'll check with the desk,
see if his name's come up.

383
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,880
- Gordon, right?
- Yeah. Who the hell are you?

384
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,560
You got to come with me now,
nice and quiet like.

385
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,600
- What are you talking about?
- Relax. We got a mutual friend.

386
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,480
- Oh, yeah, who's that?
- Oswald Cobblepot.

387
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,040
Yeah, him.

388
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,760
And if you don't come with me now,

389
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,600
we're gonna put his head in a bag
and send it to Falcone,

390
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,440
which would be embarrassing for you,
no?

391
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,160
Or maybe we've been misinformed.

392
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,040
I mean, if I'm not ringing
any bells here,

393
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,360
you can go on your merry way.

394
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,680
No, I'll come.

395
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,480
Come on, shove over.

396
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,480
Hey! Hey!

397
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,360
Welcome.

398
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,520
I'm Salvatore Maroni.

399
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,400
I know who you are.

400
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,720
What do you want?

401
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,600
- Here's the thing...
- Jim, just tell the truth.

402
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:16,920
You want a drink, Jim?

403
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,920
I'm having a Negroni.
So good with seafood.

404
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,280
Water.

405
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,280
So, our friend here told me
a fascinating story.

406
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,360
Never heard a story so good.

407
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,240
It's hard to believe it's true.

408
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,800
- It is, it's true.
- Shut up! Shut up!

409
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,600
One more word,
and I'll jam this down your throat.

410
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,840
I try to be civil, Jim.

411
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,080
But I'm not the kind of man
that likes to ask twice.

412
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,800
So, here's how it's gonna go.

413
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,720
Slow down, Mr. Maroni.
I don't know...

414
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,720
No! No. No.

415
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,800
You let me finish.

416
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,920
You'll have your turn to speak.

417
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,680
Okay, then.

418
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,360
I want you to tell me
the same exact story

419
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,160
that Penguin told me.

420
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,040
What story is that?

421
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,680
Oh, you better know what story,
my friend.

422
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,440
Because if you tell me
the same story he told me,

423
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,360
then I could believe it's true.

424
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,240
Then I'm happy.

425
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,680
But if you tell me another story,
oh, mama.

426
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,720
Then someone's lying to me.

427
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,280
And I don't know which one,
and the both of you will die.

428
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,360
Understand?

429
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,160
- Yes, I do.
- Good.

430
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,080
So...

431
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,320
Tell me a story, Jim.

432
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,280
Somebody murdered
Thomas and Martha Wayne.

433
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,240
My partner and I caught the case.

434
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,320
We didn't even know
each other then...

435
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,440
What did I say?

436
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,560
Go put him on the slicer.

437
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,400
No, no, no.

438
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,640
If I don't like what I hear,
slice his face prejute.

439
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,800
Oh, I'm sorry. Go on.

440
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,160
I was a pawn...

441
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,040
in a conspiracy

442
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,840
between Falcone,
the mayor and the G.C.P.D.

443
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,840
to frame Mario Pepper
for the Wayne murders...

444
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,920
with the help of Fish Mooney,
Mr. Cobblepot's employer at the time.

445
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,360
Mr. Cobblepot then told
the whole story to the MCU.

446
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,680
To prove that I wouldn't
betray the conspiracy,

447
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,480
Falcone ordered me to kill Cobblepot.

448
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,400
I didn't do it.

449
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,400
I let him live.

450
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
And here we are.

451
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,600
Falcone, Mooney, the MCU cops...

452
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,080
none of them know he's alive?

453
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,200
If they did, I'd be dead already.

454
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,600
It's delicious.

455
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,920
Frankie!
Bring the Penguin back out here.

456
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,360
The little punk is telling the truth.

457
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,520
Thank you, Jim.

458
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,040
Good story. Told well.

459
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,280
Lot of guys in your situation,
they freak out.

460
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,920
There you are, you rat, you snitch,
you gorgeous turncoat son of a bitch.

461
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Come here, I love you.

462
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,920
Be happy, Frankie.

463
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,160
We just got a brand-new weapon
against the Falcones.

464
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,840
It's Christmas!

465
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,680
Happy holidays. Can I go now?

466
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,120
Oh, yeah. Jim, you can go.

467
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,600
You know, just so that we,
understand each other,

468
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,040
you know, keep all this hush-hush.

469
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,120
Between us pals.

470
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,760
And if I need you again,
I'll call you.

471
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,640
Thank you.

472
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,480
You do that.

473
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,840
Look at you, come on.
Let's get you cleaned up.

474
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,920
Look at you. Come on.

475
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,520
I love you, baby.

476
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,960
I love you, baby.

477
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,960
- I love you, baby.
- Okay, now,

478
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:06,560
you're still putting too much sex
on it.

479
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,680
Keep it clean. Like a mother.

480
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,880
I love you, baby.

481
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,240
I love you, baby.

482
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,880
Good. Better.

483
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:23,120
Now, act as if you've caught me
in a lie.

484
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,960
Not angry.

485
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,880
No. Disappointment.

486
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,880
Oh, honey.

487
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,520
Oh, honey.

488
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
There you go.

489
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,360
Now, about your hair.

490
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,120
There you are.

491
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,760
Where the hell have you been?

492
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,800
Personal business.

493
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,320
You disappear in the middle
of a case,

494
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,520
you can't even tell me why?

495
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,360
That's what "personal" means.

496
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,560
You in some kind of trouble?

497
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,400
Look, forget it.
I don't want to know your problems.

498
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,120
WellZyn sent by Potolsky's stuff.
Grab a box.

499
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,640
- Anything useful yet?
- No. Classic geeky loner.

500
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,800
Lived for his work.

501
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,560
No wife, no family, no real friends.

502
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,640
Is it Barbara?

503
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,400
She get into something?

504
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,440
Oh, yeah.

505
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,360
Kind of.

506
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,160
Figures. No offense.

507
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,600
- Need any help?
- No, I'm all right, thanks.

508
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,440
Hey.

509
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,520
What do you think about this?

510
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,200
Looks like a friend, no?

511
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,080
Judging by the books and the mascot,

512
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,320
philosophy professor, Gotham U.

513
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,840
Worth a shot.

514
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:47,920
Amen.

515
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,120
I was just on my way
to an appointment,

516
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,320
but yes, I know Stan Potolsky.

517
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,240
He was a student of mine.

518
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,480
A very brilliant student.

519
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,120
And you've stayed
in touch over the years.

520
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,240
We have. He may be a biochemist,
but philosophy is a passion of his.

521
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,360
What can you tell us
about WellZyn firing him?

522
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,520
Research for WellZyn led him
into some dark moral corners.

523
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,040
WellZyn said he made shampoo.

524
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,840
Where are the dark moral corners
in that?

525
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,920
Shampoo?

526
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,560
They say that, do they?

527
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,160
No, no, Stan designed
pharmaceutical weapons

528
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,280
to be used by combat troops.

529
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,040
Drugs that worked
on an epigenetic level.

530
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,240
Imagine an army

531
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,800
made up of soldiers so strong
that they can tear a man apart

532
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,400
with their bare hands.

533
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,320
Of course, at the beginning,
there were side effects.

534
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,560
Yeah, death.

535
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,160
But Viper was the first batch.

536
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,840
They worked out the kinks
in the second version.

537
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,240
Called it Venom.

538
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,400
By then, Stan had acquired
some clarity.

539
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,440
He appealed to his
bosses to end the program.

540
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,080
They refused,
so he went over their heads

541
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,640
to Thomas and Martha Wayne.

542
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,520
He convinced them to shut it down.

543
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,800
And when they died, WellZyn
immediately revived the program

544
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,360
with the blessings
of Wayne Enterprises.

545
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,200
In the end, there was nothing
for Stan to do

546
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,200
but to resort
to more radical measures.

547
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,600
Killing people.

548
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:25,400
I'm not hearing a sense
of moral outrage, Professor.

549
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,240
If you don't mind,
I'll reserve my moral outrage

550
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,200
for the true villains of this piece.

551
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,280
You mean WellZyn.

552
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,520
You planned this with Potolsky.

553
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,920
- Yes.
- Where is he?

554
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,080
Talk fast, bub!

555
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,880
Oh, what are you gonna do to me?
I'm an old man! I'm dying.

556
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,080
I'll help you die quicker,
you terrorist.

557
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:46,680
Soon, Stan will issue a statement
the world won't be able to ignore.

558
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,800
Soon?

559
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,400
- Today?
- You're already too late.

560
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,840
Now, you tell us where he is
right now.

561
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,040
Wait a minute! You said
you had an appointment, right?

562
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,160
Where were you going?

563
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,440
Bravo!
You've asked the right question.

564
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,160
The first step to enlightenment.

565
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,200
- Where is he? Where's Potolsky?
- Those hypocrites.

566
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,960
Empty altruism will not erase
what they've done.

567
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,120
They must pay.

568
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,640
- Who? Who must pay?
- WellZyn.

569
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,280
Wayne Enterprises.

570
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:37,400
Everyone will finally
see them for what they are.

571
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,360
How? Where's Potolsky headed?

572
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,080
What's altruism?

573
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,720
Charity.

574
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,720
I know where he's going.

575
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,960
- Name, please?
- He's, Bruce Wayne.

576
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,040
Master Bruce Wayne.

577
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,440
- Just this way. Thank you.
- Thank you.

578
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:37,240
<i>Wayne Enterprises
is a helping hand...</i>

579
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,280
<i>A port in the storm.</i>

580
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,720
Oh, that's Ms. Mathis.

581
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,760
She worked closely with your father.

582
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,800
<i>Wayne Enterprises
is a shelter for all.</i>

583
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,880
<i>And clean water...</i>

584
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,200
Please, sit, Bruce.

585
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,160
It is so good to see you out
and about.

586
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,880
Glad to be here.

587
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:20,000
All of us at Wayne Enterprises
are so sorry for your loss.

588
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,680
So, are all you here on the board?

589
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,000
Oh, heavens no.
We're middle management.

590
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,280
The board members
don't do this sort of thing.

591
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
No?

592
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,960
Why not?

593
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,240
Well, they're very busy people,
Bruce.

594
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,640
Your family created a company

595
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,040
worth billions
and billions of dollars.

596
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,400
- How awesome is that?
- Awesome.

597
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,080
I wanted to speak to them
because I've found

598
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,760
what looks like serious
irregularities

599
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,840
in the Arkham project.

600
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,640
Irregularities?

601
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,840
I can assure you, Bruce,
that Wayne Enterprises

602
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,840
would never countenance
doing business with criminals.

603
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,600
- Just wouldn't happen.
- I hope so,

604
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,760
but I'd like to speak
directly with the board myself.

605
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:16,080
Can you make that happen?

606
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,040
I can certainly try.

607
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,200
They prefer to communicate
with minors

608
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,560
via the usual legal mediation, but...

609
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,960
<i>Good evening, ladies and gentleman.</i>

610
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,880
<i>This is a public service announcement
on behalf of all living creatures.</i>

611
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,000
<i>You've heard of a drug called Viper?</i>

612
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,280
<i>That's me.</i>

613
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:46,280
<i>I made it for WellZyn,
a subsidiary of Wayne Enterprises.</i>

614
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,720
- Is this true?
- Of course not, Bruce.

615
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,840
I mean, this man is clearly insane.

616
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,920
The AC plant, where is it?
On the roof?

617
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,480
Straight ahead, staircase
across the ballroom.

618
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,720
Clear the ballroom!

619
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,880
<i>I hoped that a demonstration
using street people would suffice,</i>

620
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,840
<i>but seems bad things
only truly happen</i>

621
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,920
<i>when they happen to important people.</i>

622
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,680
<i>Like you!</i>

623
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,720
G.C.P.D.! Everybody out!

624
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,800
Now!

625
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,400
Turn it off!

626
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,520
Can't do that.

627
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,960
Turn it off or I'll shoot!

628
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,040
Go ahead.

629
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,720
My work is done.

630
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,080
Turn around!
Put your hands behind your head!

631
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,760
Interlock your fingers!

632
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,840
That's all right.

633
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:02,880
You're angry and confused.
I understand.

634
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,480
There's no more need for violence.

635
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,440
Don't shoot!

636
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,240
That's considerate of you.

637
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,960
I'm leaving now.

638
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,280
Go look in warehouse 39.

639
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,640
You're not going anywhere!

640
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,240
I can go anywhere I want!

641
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,640
Don't do it!

642
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,240
You really can have
too much of a good thing.

643
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,080
Nothing.

644
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,880
What'd you expect?

645
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,640
It's Gotham.

646
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,440
It's Mathis.

647
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,040
I'm outside the site. They're here.

648
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,560
No. I think we should leave them be.

649
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,280
There's nothing here for them.

650
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,520
We'll review that if they get close.

651
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,640
It's been ten minutes.

652
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,320
I, I assure you,
my friend is reliable.

653
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,800
You scared, Penguin?

654
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,520
Your voice is doing that shaky thing.

655
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,000
No, sir. I'm fine.

656
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,720
You don't have to act tough.

657
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,800
Nerves are a good thing.

658
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,200
Perhaps I am a bit jittery, sir.

659
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,680
Good.

660
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,760
You should be.

661
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,680
Because if my boys don't make it,
neither do you.

662
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,400
Got them!

663
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,480
Keep going!

664
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,560
Take that, Falcone,
you son of a bitch!

665
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:16,480
Huh? I told you, Frankie,
the kid's a player.

666
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,560
He's got a future.

667
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,040
What are you waiting
here like an old lady?

668
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,080
Go!

669
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,680
Untie me.

670
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,640
Say "pretty please."

671
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,800
Please.

672
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,640
Sometimes I think
you really don't like me.

673
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,360
Now, would I be backing your takeover
if I didn't like you?

674
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,800
And that stuff with Falcone,

675
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,840
well, we have to look good
for the old man.

676
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,960
If he figures out
we're working together...

677
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,000
we'd be cooked.

678
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,960
- Patience.
- I have no more patience.

679
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,000
The old man has to go.

680
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,720
We must strike soon.

681
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,600
Yes. But softly.

682
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,960
Excuse me.

683
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,000
I couldn't help but overhear
that aria you were humming.

684
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,160
- Oh, yes. It's my favorite.
- Mine, too.

685
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,720
Oh, well, there you go.

686
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,920
I'm sorry, I, I just...

687
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,680
I, I didn't mean to bother you.

688
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,040
My mother sang that to me
when I was young.

689
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,520
Her whole life, she sang that to me.

690
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:31,040
I hadn't heard it in a while,
and I...

691
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,440
I had to smile because you look...

692
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,280
Anyhow, sorry, I'm rambling on.

693
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,280
No, that's okay.

694
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,560
Do you want to listen?

695
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:48,880
- Well, yeah. Sure, thank you.
- Let's sit down.
