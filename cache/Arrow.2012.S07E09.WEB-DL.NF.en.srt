610
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:45,863
BECAUSE...I THINK WE HAVE
A NEW PROBLEM.

611
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,764
COME ON. YOU CAN DO
BETTER THAN THAT.

612
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:13,557
YOU'RE A KILLER,
A DEPRAVED MONSTER

613
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,308
WHO FOUND A WAY TO
CHANNEL HIS DARKNESS

614
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,728
AND PAT HIMSELF
ON THE BACK FOR IT!

615
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,772
YOU'LL NEVER BEAT ME.
TOO SLOW, BIG HEART.

616
00:32:19,813 --> 00:32:22,733
MAMA RAISED YOU RIGHT,
SO RIGHT,

617
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:24,818
YOU COULDN'T STOP ME
FROM KILLING HER.

618
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:29,322
YOUR FATHER TOOK
THE COWARD'S WAY OUT,

619
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,909
AND ALL THESE YEARS,
YOU TOLD YOURSELF
IT WAS BRAVE,

620
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:35,203
BUT HE WAS A COWARD
JUST LIKE YOU.

621
00:32:35,245 --> 00:32:36,204
A FAILURE.

622
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:37,414
SELFISH.

623
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:39,374
SLOW.

624
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:41,543
PATHETIC.

625
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:42,836
PATHETIC.

626
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:49,593
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

627
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:01,396
NO. SERIOUSLY,
WHO ARE YOU?

628
00:33:01,438 --> 00:33:04,190
YOUR FRIENDS WERE EXPOSED
TO A POWERFUL HALLUCINOGEN.

629
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,525
ARE YOU GUYS
ALL RIGHT?

630
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:07,235
DEFINE ALL RIGHT.

631
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:12,532
SO HOW DOES
A BOOK MAKE PEOPLE
CHANGE BODIES?

632
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:15,076
DEEGAN SAID HE WAS
USING THE BOOK
TO CHANGE REALITY.

633
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,496
CISCO: SAME QUESTION.
HOW DOES A BOOK
CHANGE REALITY?

634
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,414
WE'LL FIGURE THAT OUT
WHEN WE GET BACK
TO STAR CITY.

635
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:21,541
GUYS, WE'RE GONNA NEED
SOME HELP WITH THIS LOCK.

636
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,543
GOOD. THEN
YOU'LL BE LEAVING GOTHAM.

637
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:25,712
YOU GUYS HAVE CAUSED
ENOUGH PROBLEMS
FOR ONE NIGHT.

638
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:28,507
HEY. WOULD HITCHING
A RIDE IN THE BATMOBILE
BE OUT OF THE QUESTION?

639
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,425
GET...OUT.

640
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:32,010
SURE.

641
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,971
KARA: SHE REALLY IS LIKE BATMAN.
BARRY: YEP.

642
00:33:40,853 --> 00:33:43,605
I DON'T DO
TEARFUL GOOD-BYES.

643
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:46,775
NO. I...I JUST WANTED
TO WISH YOU LUCK.

644
00:33:46,817 --> 00:33:49,611
WHEREVER YOUR
COUSIN IS,

645
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:53,281
I'M SURE HE'S REALLY
PROUD OF YOU.

646
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:55,784
X-RAY VISION.

647
00:33:55,826 --> 00:33:58,662
YOU REALLY DO HAVE
A LOT OF TATTOOS.

648
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:02,165
SOMEHOW, I FEEL LIKE
KARA DANVERS DOESN'T
HAVE A SINGLE ONE.

649
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:06,753
YOU KNOW, IT'S SUCH
A SHAME I HAVE TO GO

650
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:09,255
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE
WE WOULD MAKE
A GOOD TEAM.

651
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,090
WORLD'S FINEST.

652
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:15,762
HEH HEH.

653
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,437
FELICITY: OH. LOOK WHO
FINALLY CAME BACK.

654
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:26,606
WITH WHAT LOOKS LIKE
A FAIRLY INFAMOUS BOOK.

655
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:28,066
CAITLIN: A BOOK WITH
A CRYPTOGRAPHIC LOCK ON IT.

656
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,735
OLIVER: CAN YOU
GET TO WORK ON
OPENING IT, PLEASE?

657
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:30,986
JOHN: WE DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF TIME.

658
00:34:31,028 --> 00:34:33,572
OK. GEEK SQUAD,
FORM UP ON ME!

659
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,156
NOT MUCH
OF A HEARTFELT REUNION.

660
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,909
SHE'S GETTING USED
TO EVERYTHING.

661
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:39,536
DO YOU WANT ME TO
TALK TO HER AS,
YOU KNOW, YOU?

662
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:42,080
I THINK I'M IN ENOUGH
TROUBLE WITH FELICITY
AS IT IS,

663
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,957
BUT NO OFFENSE.

664
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:45,625
HEY. CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE, THEN?

665
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:47,419
-YEAH. WHAT'S UP?
-I JUST WANTED TO SEE

666
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,754
HOW YOU'RE DOING.

667
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,714
I'M COMPARTMENTALIZING.

668
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:52,257
I'LL FIX THINGS
WITH FELICITY LATER.

669
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:54,718
I DON'T MEAN
WITH FELICITY.

670
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,637
WE BOTH SAW SOME STUFF
BACK AT ARKHAM.

671
00:34:57,679 --> 00:34:59,932
I SAW EVIL FLASH.

672
00:34:59,973 --> 00:35:01,182
EOBARD THAWNE.

673
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,018
I SAW MALCOLM MERLYN.

674
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,352
-OH.
-I KNEW YOU'D BEEN

675
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:05,854
THROUGH A LOT,
BUT...

676
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:07,313
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
I NEVER REALIZED.

677
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,815
I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU DO IT.

678
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:10,400
I WOULDN'T BE
ABLE TO LIVE

679
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:12,110
WITH THE BURDENS
THAT YOU CARRY.

680
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:13,612
YES, YOU WOULD.

681
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,405
BARRY, I ALWAYS THOUGHT
THAT YOU HAD IT EASY,

682
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:18,366
EVERYTHING WAS JUST
SUNSHINE AND RAINBOWS

683
00:35:18,408 --> 00:35:22,079
AND...EVERYBODY LIKES YOU.

684
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:27,459
YOU HAVE REAL STEEL
IN YOU, MY FRIEND.

685
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:30,087
YOU CAN CARRY ANY BURDEN
THROWN YOUR WAY.

686
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:34,007
SOME UNSOLICITED
ADVICE?

687
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:35,759
HMM.

688
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:39,387
DON'T WAIT TO
WORK THINGS OUT
WITH FELICITY.

689
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:41,932
OUR LINE OF WORK,
YOU NEVER KNOW HOW
MUCH TIME YOU GOT.

690
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:48,354
NOT ONLY IS THE LOCK
CRYPTOGRAPHIC...

691
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:50,356
IT'S METAPHYSICAL.
THE READINGS I'M
GETTING OFF THIS THING

692
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,525
ARE NUTS...AND, YES,
THAT'S A TECHNICAL TERM.

693
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:55,153
OLIVER: UM, MAY I SPEAK
WITH FELICITY FOR A MINUTE?

694
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:58,156
CISCO: SURE THING, BARRY...
OLIVER...BOLIVER.

695
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:00,993
CAITLIN: STOP HELPING.

696
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:02,911
THIS MUST BE STRANGE
FOR YOU.

697
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:04,496
OH. WHAT GAVE YOU
THAT IDEA?

698
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:07,124
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE IT'S EASIER
FOR YOU TO HEAR THIS

699
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:10,752
COMING FROM...
[WHISPERS] BARRY ALLEN.

700
00:36:10,794 --> 00:36:11,962
HEAR WHAT?

701
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:16,800
THAT WE'RE GONNA BE OK.

702
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:19,678
PEOPLE CHANGE, FELICITY.

703
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:22,221
IT MEANS WE'RE GROWING.

704
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,349
IT MEANS WE'RE
EVOLVING,

705
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,600
EXCEPT FOR ONE THING,

706
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:27,560
ONE THING THAT
WILL NOT CHANGE...

707
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:32,732
IS HOW I FEEL
ABOUT YOU.

708
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:36,569
LOVE IS TOO SMALL
A WORD...

709
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:42,408
AND NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE

710
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,536
OR...OR WHAT YOU BECOME,

711
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,287
NO MATTER WHO I AM

712
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,790
OR...OR WHAT I BECOME...

713
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:53,628
YOU WILL ALWAYS BE...

714
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,588
YOU WILL ALWAYS BE
THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.

715
00:36:57,465 --> 00:37:00,010
PEOPLE CHANGE.

716
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:02,054
THAT NEVER WILL.

717
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:08,810
OLIVER, I...

718
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:14,357
[THUNDER]

719
00:37:17,694 --> 00:37:19,278
BARRY: JAY?

720
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,615
-NO.
-OH, MY GOD. DAD?

721
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:25,911
MY NAME IS BARRY ALLEN.

722
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,620
HELLO, JOHN.

723
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:28,872
DO...DO I KNOW YOU?

724
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:30,957
YOU'RE NOT WEARING
YOUR RING.

725
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:32,834
THINGS MUST BE
DIFFERENT HERE.

726
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:35,503
OLIVER: BARRY,
WHERE'S THERE?

727
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:37,589
MY EARTH, EARTH 90.

728
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:40,092
I'VE TRAVELED FROM THERE
TO WARN YOU.

729
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:42,343
-WARN US ABOUT WHAT?
-HIS NAME IS MAR NOVU,

730
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:45,263
BUT HE CALLS HIMSELF
THE MONITOR NOW.

731
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:48,850
HE'S BEEN UNLEASHING
THE BOOK OF DESTINY

732
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:52,187
ACROSS THE MULTIVERSE
TO TEST DIFFERENT EARTHS.

733
00:37:52,229 --> 00:37:54,480
TEST THEM FOR WHAT?

734
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:57,525
A CRISIS THAT HE
BELIEVES IS COMING.

735
00:37:57,567 --> 00:38:00,862
NOVU THINKS
THE ELSEWORLDS CREATED

736
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:03,406
BY THE BOOK OF DESTINY
APPROXIMATES

737
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:07,368
THE COLLISION OF REALITIES
THAT WE'RE FACING.

738
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:10,122
GUYS...

739
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:11,915
WE GOT A SITUATION.

740
00:38:11,957 --> 00:38:13,959
CISCO.

741
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:18,046
THAT...THAT'S HIM
FROM THE VIBE.

742
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,428
BARRY: MAR NOVU,

743
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,222
YOU'RE GONNA
STAND DOWN.

744
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:30,349
YOU'RE GONNA USE
THAT BOOK TO HELP US
SET REALITY RIGHT.

745
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,977
WELL, I CERTAINLY
WOULDN'T HAVE PLACED IT

746
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,937
IN DEEGAN'S HANDS
IF THAT WERE MY INTENT.

747
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:35,563
ENOUGH.

748
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:37,356
YOU WILL NOT DO
TO THIS EARTH

749
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,858
WHAT YOU DID TO MINE.

750
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,111
I ADMIRE YOUR
PERSISTENCE, BARRY.

751
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,994
HE SAID YOU WERE
TESTING US.

752
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,495
MONITOR: INDEED,
AND THUS FAR,

753
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:52,038
I AM UNIMPRESSED.

754
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,623
A CRISIS IS IMMINENT.

755
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,333
SOMEONE IS COMING,

756
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:58,336
SOMEONE FAR, FAR MORE POWERFUL
THAN MYSELF.

757
00:38:58,377 --> 00:38:59,879
I MEAN TO PREPARE.

758
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:02,090
BY GIVING A NUT BAR
AN ALL-POWERFUL

759
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:03,716
REALITY-REWRITING
BOOK?

760
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:07,470
I AM TESTING UNIVERSES
TO FIND ONE, I HOPE,

761
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:08,888
STRONG ENOUGH TO STAND
AGAINST HIM.

762
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:10,515
YOU'RE CAUSING CHAOS,

763
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:12,142
AND YOU'RE BLAMING
EVERYONE ELSE!

764
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:14,060
