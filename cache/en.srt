1
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,471
I am Knull.

2
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:58,349
God of the void.

3
00:00:58,432 --> 00:01:00,851
Slicer of worlds.

4
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,104
<i>Long ago,</i>

5
00:01:03,187 --> 00:01:06,064
<i>when light invaded my kingdom,</i>

6
00:01:06,148 --> 00:01:09,317
<i>my symbiote children betrayed me</i>

7
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:12,529
<i>and imprisoned me here.</i>

8
00:01:16,867 --> 00:01:20,453
At last,
a codex has been created.

9
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:23,749
It is the key to my freedom.

10
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,877
It will unlock this prison.

11
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:31,257
I order you to search
the corners of the universe

12
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,593
until you find this key.

13
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:37,930
Find me the codex.

14
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,564
And when I escape,

15
00:01:46,647 --> 00:01:48,940
and annihilate
every living planet

16
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:53,070
and destroy
my symbiote offspring,

17
00:01:53,195 --> 00:01:55,280
I will reward you...

18
00:01:56,115 --> 00:01:57,574
with your lives.

19
00:02:33,944 --> 00:02:35,820
<i>So you're saying
in this universe,</i>

20
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,740
<i>there's these superhero people.</i>

21
00:02:37,865 --> 00:02:38,949
All right.

22
00:02:39,825 --> 00:02:42,911
So tell me again
about your purple alien friend

23
00:02:42,995 --> 00:02:44,955
who really loves stones.

24
00:02:45,831 --> 00:02:47,874
'Cause I'll tell you what, man,

25
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:51,378
aliens, they do not love stones.

26
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:52,731
- <i>Eddie, don't start.</i>
- No.

27
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:55,132
No, they do not love stones.

28
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,130
Do you know what they love?

29
00:02:58,135 --> 00:03:00,137
They love eating brains!

30
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,056
Because that's what they do.

31
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:06,393
<i>Señor,</i> he made
my family disappear.

32
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:07,603
For five years.

33
00:03:10,147 --> 00:03:11,857
Five years, huh?

34
00:03:13,734 --> 00:03:15,193
Well, that is a long time.

35
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:17,822
All right.

36
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,031
<i>Eddie!</i>

37
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:21,325
<i>We are drunk!</i>

38
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,256
<i>We're home!</i>

39
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,258
<i>I'm so done
with the multi-verse shit.</i>

40
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,970
<i>And I like our version
of the barman better.</i>

41
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,639
Ow. My head hurts.

42
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,141
I feel like I'm drunk,

43
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:47,559
but I'm also hungover
at the same time.

44
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,812
<i>Eddie!
You want a Bloody Maria.</i>

45
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:51,480
<i>Oh yeah!</i>

46
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:57,069
- No.
- I don't want a drink.

47
00:04:00,614 --> 00:04:03,116
Stop! You are destroying
this man's bar!

48
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:10,874
<i>Tequila!</i>

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,627
<i>I'm having the time
of my life, Eddie!</i>

50
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,463
I'd rather have
a glass of water.

51
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:17,881
<i>Be a man, Eddie.</i>

52
00:04:19,383 --> 00:04:22,052
<i>We should've been a bartender!</i>

53
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,017
<i>- Tequila!
- I did it.</i>

54
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,143
I did it.

55
00:04:31,645 --> 00:04:34,189
What the hell were those things?

56
00:04:35,357 --> 00:04:36,900
I was born with them.

57
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:41,197
Freaking bar!
I'm done with this shit!

58
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:46,660
<i>This is Kelly Roulet
reporting from San Francisco.</i>

59
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:49,079
<i>Police are still
trying to locate</i>

60
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:50,849
<i>former reporter
Eddie Brock for questioning...</i>

61
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,082
Oh no.

62
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:55,127
<i>After the tragic death
of Detective Patrick Mulligan.</i>

63
00:04:55,252 --> 00:04:56,336
No.

64
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,589
<i>Detective Mulligan
was found impaled</i>

65
00:04:58,672 --> 00:05:01,174
<i>amidst a series
of bizarre happenings</i>

66
00:05:01,258 --> 00:05:02,676
<i>at the city's cathedral.</i>

67
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,386
They think that I killed him.

68
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,514
<i>How long can he
evade authorities?</i>

69
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,015
<i>Only time will tell.</i>

70
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:10,433
<i>If we are on the news here,</i>

71
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:13,437
<i>we are on the news everywhere.</i>

72
00:05:15,105 --> 00:05:16,815
Well, we can't go back
to San Francisco.

73
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,358
And I'm not staying down here,

74
00:05:18,442 --> 00:05:21,153
hiding for the rest of my life
in Mexico, that's for sure.

75
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,446
<i>Where will we go?</i>

76
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,365
I don't know. I don't know.

77
00:05:28,118 --> 00:05:29,536
Ooh.

78
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,498
That could work. Hey.

79
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:33,749
This judge got me

80
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,673
- kicked out of New York.
- <i>What a dick!</i>

81
00:05:35,751 --> 00:05:38,378
Yeah, I still got a ton
of shit on him too.

82
00:05:38,462 --> 00:05:41,923
<i>I've always wanted
to see the Statue of Liberty.</i>

83
00:05:42,007 --> 00:05:44,175
Maybe we could blackmail him.

84
00:05:45,135 --> 00:05:47,303
And clear my name.

85
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:48,389
<i>Let's go!</i>

86
00:05:49,056 --> 00:05:51,683
<i>- Road trip!</i>
- Let's get the hell out of here.

87
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,395
<i>Keep the change!</i>

88
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:03,028
We keep our heads down,
and we keep moving.

89
00:06:06,073 --> 00:06:07,908
<i>We are fugitives!</i>

90
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:10,452
<i>We are on the run!</i>

91
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:13,247
<i>Yes, we are innocent. Yes.</i>

92
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:17,500
<i>But I will eat every bad guy
that gets in our way.</i>

93
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:19,336
I need a Tylenol.

94
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:33,725
Do you hear that?

95
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:47,280
<i>Someone's in trouble.</i>

96
00:06:47,364 --> 00:06:49,324
<i>And I need fuel for the road.</i>

97
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:50,409
Yeah, okay.

98
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:12,889
<i>That way.</i>

99
00:07:23,817 --> 00:07:25,193
<i>Bad men, Eddie.</i>

100
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:30,032
<i>Are we the Lethal Protector,
or not?</i>

101
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,579
Do your thing.

102
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:36,747
<i>Easy-peasy.</i>

103
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:54,515
Jesus.

104
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:03,440
<i>Cute!</i>

105
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:05,234
<i>I promise not to eat it.</i>

106
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,112
They're fighting dogs.

107
00:08:09,196 --> 00:08:12,199
<i>I draw the line
at fighting dogs, pal.</i>

108
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:21,416
<i>Oye, vato,</i>
you're in the wrong place.

109
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,961
Oh, hello.

110
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:25,545
This is our territory.

111
00:08:26,922 --> 00:08:28,506
Well, I assume

112
00:08:28,632 --> 00:08:30,342
by the threatening look
on your faces

113
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:33,262
that I oughta be scared, right?

114
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,892
But you took
the wrong path, <i>hermano.</i>

115
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,352
We can't let you leave.

116
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,522
I have a headache

117
00:08:43,605 --> 00:08:47,191
on account of the fact
that I was drinking a lot.

118
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:48,277
I'm gonna be honest.

119
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:52,739
I have a really dark
and unpredictable side to me.

120
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,491
We all have monsters inside us.

121
00:08:55,242 --> 00:08:56,368
Not like this.

122
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,954
So dark that it is highly likely

123
00:08:59,079 --> 00:09:02,373
to tear your head off
and feed it

124
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:03,542
to your asshole.

125
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:05,418
<i>Or me!
You can feed it to me!</i>

126
00:09:05,502 --> 00:09:06,961
Yeah, or I can feed it to him.

127
00:09:08,672 --> 00:09:10,817
All right. Look. Whoa, Whoa.
Come on. I got a suggestion.

128
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,050
No. Stop speaking.

129
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,136
I'm not gonna stop speaking.
This is for you.

130
00:09:14,219 --> 00:09:16,387
I'm doing this
for your benefit, all right?

131
00:09:16,513 --> 00:09:18,890
I don't have to. Okay?
So pay attention.

132
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,161
We're gonna find all of these
dogs loving forever homes

133
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,520
because what you're doing
is reprehensible.

134
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:26,314
What does your mother
think of you, man?

135
00:09:26,398 --> 00:09:28,316
My mother's dead, <i>culero.</i>

136
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,692
<i>You made it awkward!</i>

137
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,361
I'm sorry to hear that.

138
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:33,739
Huh?

139
00:09:40,412 --> 00:09:42,414
I'm giving you a chance.

140
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:44,791
Sweetie, I really am
giving you a chance.

141
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,167
You should probably take it.

142
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,301
Say <i>when.</i>

143
00:09:54,426 --> 00:09:55,718
When.

144
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,189
<i>Hola,</i> bitches.

145
00:10:29,711 --> 00:10:30,711
Oh!

146
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,007
Who's a bad boy?

147
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:43,100
Now that's some sturdy footwear!

148
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:47,354
- Where you going?

149
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,190
Home.

150
00:10:50,315 --> 00:10:51,357
Nah.

151
00:10:59,908 --> 00:11:00,992
What...

152
00:11:02,077 --> 00:11:03,078
are you?

153
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:06,748
We are...

154
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,416
We are Venom!

155
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,084
We are...

156
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,795
- Venom!
- No!

157
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,213
- Oh!
- Yeah.

158
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,423
- We...
- We...

159
00:11:14,506 --> 00:11:17,258
are Venom.

160
00:11:18,093 --> 00:11:19,094
What?

161
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:23,181
We are totally gonna
need to work on that.

162
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:34,109
<i>That was delicious!</i>

163
00:11:34,234 --> 00:11:35,944
You're welcome.

164
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,487
Thank you.

165
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:40,282
<i>You take me
to all the finest places!</i>

166
00:11:40,365 --> 00:11:42,116
Let's get the hell out of here.

167
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,493
Where's my shoe?

168
00:11:44,411 --> 00:11:45,829
Oh, hey, buddy!

169
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:48,123
That's my shoe!
That's my shoe. That's my shoe!

170
00:11:48,248 --> 00:11:49,791
Give me my shoe.

171
00:11:56,757 --> 00:11:58,258
<i>These Will fit.</i>

172
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,218
Now we are on the run

173
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,220
for something
we actually did do.

174
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,806
And I got stuck with a superhero
who can't fly.

175
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:05,891
<i>Wanna bet?</i>

176
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,084
There you are.

177
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,048
Get me General Strickland.

178
00:12:57,901 --> 00:12:58,902
What the...?

179
00:13:07,494 --> 00:13:08,870
Viral shedding.

180
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:11,831
These things wanna live.

181
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,093
Tell me about the man
who was just here.

182
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,892
He was acting, like, crazy.
Talking to himself.

183
00:13:31,935 --> 00:13:33,061
What was he saying?

184
00:13:34,229 --> 00:13:38,729
He had these big,
massive, wild arms.

185
00:13:39,484 --> 00:13:40,860
They were bobbling like this.

186
00:13:43,363 --> 00:13:44,364
Bring him.

187
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,445
<i>You think there are
another brother and sister</i>

188
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:06,636
<i>on one of those stars...</i>

189
00:14:08,096 --> 00:14:10,056
looking at the same sky?

190
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,016
I'll be able to tell you
one day.

191
00:14:16,104 --> 00:14:17,605
My twin brother...

192
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:19,565
a future NASA scientist.

193
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,110
One day.

194
00:14:25,822 --> 00:14:27,907
When thunder roars,
head indoors.

195
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:46,718
No!

196
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,376
<i>He's on life support.</i>

197
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,795
<i>Get him
to emergency symbiosis now.</i>

198
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,602
It should be you.

199
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:41,416
<i>This just came across
our news desk</i>

200
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,441
<i>and it bears repeating:</i>

201
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:45,944
<i>For all of you alien enthusiasts
out there, it's a sad day.</i>

202
00:15:46,027 --> 00:15:49,947
<i>Washington has finally announced
the decommissioning of Area 51.</i>

203
00:15:50,031 --> 00:15:51,657
<i>The controversial site is famous</i>

204
00:15:51,741 --> 00:15:53,993
<i>for its alleged testing
on aliens.</i>

205
00:15:54,077 --> 00:15:55,453
<i>In other news today...</i>

206
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,385
Right this way. Come on up.

207
00:16:26,776 --> 00:16:27,818
Strickland.

208
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,529
<i>Strickland authorized.</i>

209
00:16:45,128 --> 00:16:47,088
- It's finally happening, then.
- Yeah.

210
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:51,134
Yes, ma'am. Be nothing left
but rock and dust.

211
00:16:51,259 --> 00:16:52,885
And roaches.

212
00:16:52,969 --> 00:16:55,304
Even the biggest of bangs
couldn't kill <i>'em.</i>

213
00:16:55,388 --> 00:16:58,516
They've been around 280 million
years. And counting.

214
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,892
I did not know that, Dr. Paine.

215
00:17:07,275 --> 00:17:08,276
Good to go.

216
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,903
- Have a good one, Gus.
- You too.

217
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,064
- Thank you.
- Yes, ma'am.

218
00:17:51,444 --> 00:17:54,280
Morning, Dr. Paine,
we'll keep 'em safe for you.

219
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:56,300
I still don't think anyone
wants my old beater, Jim.

220
00:17:56,324 --> 00:17:57,992
Never judge a book by its cover.

221
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:05,166
Early morning wake-up,
General Strickland.

222
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,585
Looks like
all your dreams came true.

223
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,837
I know how that must bug you.

224
00:18:10,797 --> 00:18:13,049
He arrived shortly
before you did.

225
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,884
Did our new friend
give him any trouble?

226
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,719
You see,
that's exactly the problem.

227
00:18:16,803 --> 00:18:17,804
What?

228
00:18:17,887 --> 00:18:19,367
Your assumption
we're meeting friends.

229
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,101
- Morning.
- Good morning.

230
00:18:23,935 --> 00:18:25,686
The bonding was successful.

231
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:26,896
I heard.

232
00:18:31,484 --> 00:18:33,194
You always have this
look on your face

233
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,678
like something terrible
is imminent.

234
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:35,822
Because in my line of work

235
00:18:35,905 --> 00:18:37,990
something terrible
is always imminent.

236
00:18:38,074 --> 00:18:40,493
We contain them, you study them.

237
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,078
It's how it works.

238
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,503
Let's have a look.

239
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,338
- Hello, doctor.
- Morning.

240
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,590
His other symbiote
left him for dead.

241
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,303
<i>We saved him.</i>

242
00:18:58,428 --> 00:18:59,554
He would have died.

243
00:19:03,224 --> 00:19:04,433
Oh, try lowering those levels.

244
00:19:11,274 --> 00:19:12,692
Morning, Sadie.

245
00:19:12,817 --> 00:19:14,151
Let me get that.

246
00:19:14,277 --> 00:19:15,903
We got this down in Mexico.

247
00:19:15,987 --> 00:19:18,197
Hi. Welcome.

248
00:19:19,407 --> 00:19:20,866
Any more on
where the rest of him is?

249
00:19:20,992 --> 00:19:23,411
- We're gettin' there.
- Update me as you have it.

250
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,290
I don't get this obsession.

251
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,709
I told you.
My mom made me this pin.

252
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:30,876
It's July.

253
00:19:31,878 --> 00:19:33,598
- I'll see you in there.
- Mm-mm.

254
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,466
Everyone on this side...

255
00:19:37,425 --> 00:19:39,176
is weird.

256
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,719
Leave her alone, Rex.

257
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:43,807
God forbid anyone should
actually enjoy their work.

258
00:19:58,154 --> 00:20:00,030
Area 51 will be
fully decommissioned

259
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:01,366
by the end of the week.

260
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:02,908
It's just a shipwreck anyway,

261
00:20:02,992 --> 00:20:04,743
and they're tired
of the tourists.

262
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:07,162
But we don't exist down here.

263
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,623
A hundred feet subsurface...

264
00:20:08,748 --> 00:20:11,250
undetectable to any human...

265
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,419
or nonhuman.

266
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,880
No one's phoning home from here.

267
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,340
My brother's greatest ambition

268
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:20,260
was to work up there at 51
doing what I do.

269
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,571
And I wish
I could have shown him

270
00:20:22,595 --> 00:20:23,762
what we've built down here.

271
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,227
<i>You're okay.</i>

272
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:30,979
<i>Just"</i>

273
00:20:32,313 --> 00:20:34,356
<i>try to breathe. Okay?</i>

274
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,503
When my brother and I were kids

275
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:40,947
they told us that UFOs were just
weather balloons, space trash.

276
00:20:41,072 --> 00:20:44,241
Kubrick directed the moon
landing in a Hollywood studio.

277
00:20:45,076 --> 00:20:46,452
Cool story.

278
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,538
Where are you going? This first.

279
00:20:48,663 --> 00:20:50,331
Is there an increased risk
of exposure?

280
00:20:51,207 --> 00:20:53,500
It's not us I'm worried about.

281
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:56,045
You know we carry all kinds
of viruses and bacteria

282
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:57,857
that could be harmful
to a sensitive life form.

283
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:00,425
And we don't know exactly
what we're dealing with here.

284
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,734
As long as we're keeping
the guests safe.

285
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:11,394
This is the first time
we've had a host

286
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:12,913
compatible with
one of our symbiotes.

287
00:21:12,937 --> 00:21:14,855
And now we'll be able
to talk to one.

288
00:21:17,108 --> 00:21:18,192
<i>Monsters.</i>

289
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,544
He's been experiencing panic
surges since we bonded him.

290
00:21:36,669 --> 00:21:39,463
You try "Jingle Bells"?
So soothing.

291
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:41,674
Wow, why didn't I think of that?

292
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,011
Release him.

293
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,725
<i>Monsters.</i>

294
00:21:53,686 --> 00:21:55,938
<i>I'm Dr. Paine. Teddy.</i>

295
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,524
You're safe here.

296
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,109
We're gonna help you.

297
00:22:01,444 --> 00:22:02,653
Both of you.

298
00:22:04,739 --> 00:22:06,657
The transfer was successful.

299
00:22:07,867 --> 00:22:09,076
We had no choice.

300
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:10,786
We had to try and save you.

301
00:22:18,294 --> 00:22:19,628
<i>Monsters.</i>

302
00:22:27,595 --> 00:22:28,929
<i>You're broken too.</i>

303
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:38,940
<i>May I...?</i>

304
00:22:43,361 --> 00:22:44,695
<i>May I ask you some questions?</i>

305
00:22:50,076 --> 00:22:52,411
Is the symbiote
communicating with you?

306
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:56,249
<i>Do you hear it?</i>

307
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,128
Sound distresses them.

308
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:04,883
<i>Okay.</i>

309
00:23:08,511 --> 00:23:10,596
<i>- Why are they here?
- What do they want?</i>

310
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:11,889
<i>Safe haven.</i>

311
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,600
<i>Safe haven?</i>

312
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,351
<i>We were running.</i>

313
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,645
<i>Is he talking
about the other symbiotes?</i>

314
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,147
<i>I think so.</i>

315
00:23:19,939 --> 00:23:23,442
His creatures
search the universe for us.

316
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,903
<i>But we will be found.</i>

317
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:31,450
<i>And when we are,
he will kill us all.</i>

318
00:23:33,661 --> 00:23:34,662
Who?

319
00:23:35,371 --> 00:23:36,955
<i>There will be nothing left.</i>

320
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:39,458
<i>Here? On Earth?</i>

321
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,297
Why were they running?

322
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:48,759
<i>Because there is a dark,</i>

323
00:23:48,843 --> 00:23:51,971
<i>cold sea</i>

324
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:54,348
<i>around this universe.</i>

325
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:55,850
<i>What is it?</i>

326
00:24:03,566 --> 00:24:05,859
<i>You don't wanna know.</i>

327
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,830
<i>I've seen the future.</i>

328
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:37,767
The <i>darkness</i>

329
00:24:39,185 --> 00:24:43,397
<i>has teeth.</i>

330
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:49,862
<i>This is your captain speaking.</i>

331
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:53,866
<i>We are currently cruising
at a comfortable 31,000 feet.</i>

332
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:56,661
<i>If you look out there
to your left just now,</i>

333
00:24:56,744 --> 00:24:58,954
<i>you'll see the Grand Canyon.</i>

334
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:02,559
<i>Told you we could fly.</i>

335
00:25:02,583 --> 00:25:03,959
Oh my God!

336
00:25:04,043 --> 00:25:05,335
<i>Direct to New York.</i>

337
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,296
My mouth is so dry!

338
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,048
<i>And we clear your name.</i>

339
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:11,217
It's so unpleasantly cold!

340
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:14,595
How does Tom Cruise do this?

341
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,639
<i>He doesn't whine
like a little bitch!</i>

342
00:25:28,651 --> 00:25:29,860
<i>What was that?</i>

343
00:25:33,197 --> 00:25:34,406
<i>What is that?</i>

344
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:36,200
Oh fuck!

345
00:25:59,515 --> 00:26:01,975
I'm sorry, Eddie,
but I got to disappear.

346
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,020
- What, now?
- <i>We're in deep shit!</i>

347
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:08,357
Why did you do that?

348
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,651
<i>I will explain.</i>

349
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,446
No! No!

350
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,910
No! No!

351
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:26,125
I'm gonna go ahead and say that

352
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:28,711
this is the shittest hangover
of all time.

353
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:31,088
<i>Look at it, Eddie.</i>

354
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:33,883
<i>Isn't it just astonishing?</i>

355
00:26:33,966 --> 00:26:35,300
Oh, shut up.

356
00:26:35,426 --> 00:26:38,053
<i>I don't think
I mind living here forever.</i>

357
00:26:38,137 --> 00:26:41,557
We just came face-to-face
with a literal death machine.

358
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:44,185
Forever seems pretty optimistic.

359
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,318
<i>With the
decommissioning of Area 51,</i>

360
00:26:52,401 --> 00:26:55,904
<i>will the Pentagon finally admit
that they've been holding UAPs?</i>

361
00:26:55,988 --> 00:26:58,907
That's "unidentified aerial
phenomena" to you.

362
00:26:58,991 --> 00:27:00,367
Yeah, Dad, we know.

363
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:03,120
What I wouldn't give to see
who built one of those things.

364
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,997
That's why we cashed in
our savings

365
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:06,957
and came on this
road trip, babe.

366
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,834
So you could finally
get to see...

367
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,002
That it's bullshit?

368
00:27:10,086 --> 00:27:11,504
Yeah, well, what if I'm right?

369
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:13,172
Then I really hope
we don't end up

370
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:15,299
in an alien space lab
with probes up our asses.

371
00:27:15,424 --> 00:27:17,342
- Or dead.

372
00:27:17,468 --> 00:27:18,677
"Asses."

373
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,475
- Whoa!
- Whoa, whoa, Whoa!

374
00:27:28,771 --> 00:27:30,189
Kicked up some gravel there.

375
00:27:30,314 --> 00:27:32,190
- Hang tight, family.
- You good?

376
00:27:32,316 --> 00:27:34,192
That was wild!

377
00:27:34,318 --> 00:27:35,861
- Did the dog vomit?
- Yeah.

378
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:50,376
<i>Okay!</i>

379
00:27:50,501 --> 00:27:51,793
<i>We've got this.</i>

380
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:54,213
<i>Soft landing. Bend your knees.</i>

381
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:56,382
<i>Engage your core.
Engage your core!</i>

382
00:27:57,425 --> 00:28:00,553
<i>Yes! Yes, that's it!
Yes. That's it!</i>

383
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,722
Whoa!

384
00:28:03,806 --> 00:28:05,057
<i>Well done.</i>

385
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:06,684
That was terrifying.

386
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:10,354
Uh, this is not New York.

387
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:11,939
No, this is a wasteland.

388
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,774
<i>I'm detecting
passive aggression.</i>

389
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:14,859
- Are you?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

390
00:28:14,942 --> 00:28:17,653
Oh, I'm sorry. How about
some <i>active</i> aggression?

391
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:20,698
You just threw me off a 757

392
00:28:20,781 --> 00:28:22,824
without even
the slightest consideration

393
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,744
for my chronic vertigo.

394
00:28:24,827 --> 00:28:26,620
It was an Airbus A320.

395
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:29,540
Was it'? I am sorry. All right.

396
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:31,959
And what was that thing?

397
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,128
That thing
that we just juiced back there?

398
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,713
You're not going to like this.

399
00:28:35,796 --> 00:28:38,590
No, I can absolutely guarantee
you that I'm not gonna.

400
00:28:40,718 --> 00:28:42,237
What are you doing?
Why are you doing that?

401
00:28:42,261 --> 00:28:44,179
That's er... You're being weird.
That's creepy.

402
00:28:44,263 --> 00:28:46,014
That was a Xenophage.

403
00:28:46,098 --> 00:28:47,099
A What?

404
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,851
A Xenophage.

405
00:28:48,976 --> 00:28:50,978
- A symbiote hunter.
- Of course.

406
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:53,856
Problem is, if she has found
her way here,

407
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,483
others will soon follow.

408
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:56,734
"Others"?

409
00:28:56,817 --> 00:29:00,529
The Xenophage's maker
also created us symbiotes.

410
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,156
So that's your sister.

411
00:29:02,281 --> 00:29:05,492
All the symbiotes turned on him,
locked him up on Klyntar.

412
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:06,702
- Your planet.
- No!

413
00:29:06,827 --> 00:29:08,453
- Not a planet.
- Not your planet.

414
00:29:08,579 --> 00:29:10,497
A prison we built for him
to sleep...

415
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:12,458
- Of course.
- For eternity!

416
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:14,210
What's his name, then?

417
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,338
I didn't hear a word you said.

418
00:29:17,421 --> 00:29:18,463
Knull.

419
00:29:18,547 --> 00:29:19,714
- Knull.
- No!

420
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,467
Shush, shush, shush, shush.

421
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:26,472
This is serious, Eddie.

422
00:29:26,555 --> 00:29:27,806
Let's just not talk.

423
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,851
Quiet.

424
00:29:35,481 --> 00:29:38,317
<i>What does this
Xyla-Xyn-Xyn-thingy,</i>

425
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:40,277
this symbiote hunter,
want with you anyway?

426
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:43,947
It doesn't. It wants us.
We have something it needs.

427
00:29:44,031 --> 00:29:48,531
We only have this shitty shirt,
we got one boot and sunburn.

428
00:29:48,869 --> 00:29:50,453
And the codex.

429
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:51,664
The what, now?

430
00:29:51,747 --> 00:29:53,123
I'll show you.

431
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,877
Damn it, what are you doing?

432
00:29:56,961 --> 00:30:00,047
<i>Let's say you died.
I could bring you back to life.</i>

433
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:01,215
<i>Well, I like that.</i>

434
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:04,093
<i>But if I did,
our separate life forces</i>

435
00:30:04,176 --> 00:30:08,676
<i>would become one single force
called a codex.</i>

436
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,933
<i>What the hell is a codex?</i>

437
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:15,229
<i>It's a key.
A key that unlocks a cage.</i>

438
00:30:15,354 --> 00:30:16,938
<i>The prison on Klyntar.</i>

439
00:30:17,064 --> 00:30:18,940
<i>It would free our creator.</i>

440
00:30:19,066 --> 00:30:20,650
Well, thank God we haven't died.

441
00:30:20,735 --> 00:30:22,236
<i>Yeah, except that one time.</i>

442
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,199
<i>Oh, no. No.</i>

443
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,452
<i>So you're telling me
we're carrying this thing.</i>

444
00:30:29,535 --> 00:30:31,335
<i>That's Why the Xenophage
is hunting us.</i>

445
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,581
<i>What do we do?</i>

446
00:30:33,664 --> 00:30:35,165
<i>She can only see the codex</i>

447
00:30:35,249 --> 00:30:37,668
<i>when a symbiote
is in its full true form.</i>

448
00:30:40,963 --> 00:30:42,047
Right.

449
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:43,882
You mean you can't come out?

450
00:30:43,966 --> 00:30:46,343
I can do this. I can do this.

451
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:48,679
But if I fully transform,

452
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:51,474
the codex sends her
a tracking signal.

453
00:30:51,557 --> 00:30:54,309
She'll find us,
rip it out of our spine

454
00:30:54,393 --> 00:30:56,061
and free Knull from Klyntar.

455
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:57,688
So how do we
get rid of this codex?

456
00:30:57,813 --> 00:31:02,313
As long as you and I both live,
the codex exists.

457
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,612
- If one of us should die...
- No.

458
00:31:04,695 --> 00:31:05,737
The codex would die.

459
00:31:05,821 --> 00:31:07,697
- That's not gonna work for me.
- Nor me!

460
00:31:08,699 --> 00:31:10,784
That Xenophage was fast.

461
00:31:10,868 --> 00:31:12,619
It won't take long
for the feds to tie us

462
00:31:12,703 --> 00:31:15,580
to those four headless bodies
we left in Mexico.

463
00:31:15,664 --> 00:31:17,584
- We gotta get out of here.
- Yeah, we better go.

464
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:22,463
- Ah!

465
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:25,174
<i>Four legs are better than one.</i>

466
00:31:25,299 --> 00:31:27,092
Be honest with me, buddy.

467
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:31,097
How fast do you think
you can get that thing to go?

468
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:32,598
Without killing it.

469
00:31:32,681 --> 00:31:33,961
<i>Only one way to find out.</i>

470
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:38,729
<i>Don't scare him.
Don't scare horsey-horsey-horse.</i>

471
00:31:41,023 --> 00:31:42,733
<i>Nice horsey.</i>

472
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:43,943
Hey.

473
00:31:44,026 --> 00:31:45,485
<i>Nice horsey.</i>

474
00:31:47,029 --> 00:31:48,864
<i>Surprise, horsey!</i>

475
00:31:50,157 --> 00:31:51,491
<i>I love horsey!</i>

476
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:55,913
Oh!

477
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,543
Let's go. Whoa!

478
00:32:03,629 --> 00:32:05,047
<i>Yeehaw!</i>

479
00:32:10,469 --> 00:32:12,387
<i>Ride me, cowboy!</i>

480
00:32:12,471 --> 00:32:14,431
You are an asshole!

481
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:16,600
I swear to God,
when I get off this horse,

482
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:19,061
I'm gonna kick your ass,
you mother...

483
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,612
<i>Now that's horsepower!</i>

484
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:44,879
<i>Safe haven?</i>

485
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:47,923
No. They're not here
for a safe haven.

486
00:32:48,966 --> 00:32:51,301
How about a new home?
Evict the current tenants.

487
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:54,596
I think you've watched too many
alien invasion movies, Rex.

488
00:32:57,516 --> 00:32:58,517
Have I?

489
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:07,234
They were running.
That's what he said.

490
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:09,027
Don't kid yourself.

491
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,779
They were always migrating.

492
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:13,407
<i>A meteor carrying symbiote life</i>

493
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:16,243
<i>crashes on Earth,
and they all survive.</i>

494
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,536
<i>Coincidence?</i>

495
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,871
<i>Give me a break.</i>

496
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,540
All right.

497
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:24,418
Let's go get <i>'em.</i>

498
00:33:25,961 --> 00:33:27,420
You're so desperate to believe

499
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,423
that they're here
for altruistic reasons.

500
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:32,050
Makes you dangerous.

501
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:44,229
We just intercepted
an emergency call

502
00:33:44,355 --> 00:33:45,689
from an Airbus out of Mexico

503
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:48,192
saying a man jumped
off the plane over Sequoia.

504
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,152
We'll take the Osprey.

505
00:33:50,986 --> 00:33:52,195
Eyes Wide, Paine.

506
00:34:02,122 --> 00:34:03,915
I can't feel my balls.

507
00:34:06,001 --> 00:34:07,502
- That...

508
00:34:07,586 --> 00:34:08,878
That was horrible.

509
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:26,337
<i>Visual on suspect.</i>

510
00:34:29,483 --> 00:34:30,567
Take him out.

511
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:34,238
- Collect the symbiote.
<i>- Team</i> Six <i>engaged.</i>

512
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:46,541
<i>Disengage harness. Let's go.</i>

513
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:15,881
Oh!

514
00:36:15,964 --> 00:36:16,964
Oh.

515
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,138
<i>No! The codex!</i>

516
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:24,681
Can't let you die.

517
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,036
Where did that come from?

518
00:36:59,049 --> 00:37:00,717
- <i>Morph!</i>
- Copy.

519
00:37:09,017 --> 00:37:10,577
- <i>Time</i> to go!
- Hell yeah!

520
00:37:48,974 --> 00:37:50,100
What happened?

521
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,643
<i>There's something else out here.</i>

522
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,812
- Something else?
<i>- He said this would happen.</i>

523
00:37:53,937 --> 00:37:55,563
I just lost three people.

524
00:37:55,689 --> 00:37:57,232
Can you collect any samples?

525
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:00,027
Samples?

526
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:22,883
Those were not feds.

527
00:38:22,966 --> 00:38:25,134
Those were some
special forces shit.

528
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,571
<i>They were trying to kill us.</i>

529
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:27,429
Yeah.

530
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:31,141
Yeah, great. Great.
So now we have the cops,

531
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,517
the United States Army

532
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:36,396
and some creature
from hell hunting us.

533
00:38:37,314 --> 00:38:40,317
Oh, God, I just saw
blood mist spray

534
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,527
out of the back
of an alien's face.

535
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:53,830
I killed someone.

536
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:56,082
<i>They didn't give you a choice.</i>

537
00:38:57,334 --> 00:38:58,960
You didn't give me a choice.

538
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,253
<i>I couldn't get to you.</i>

539
00:39:00,337 --> 00:39:03,423
Not in the rapids. A year ago
when you stole my life.

540
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,300
<i>We've been together
for a Whole year?</i>

541
00:39:05,425 --> 00:39:07,343
A year too long.
Just stay hidden

542
00:39:07,427 --> 00:39:09,512
while we get to New York
without getting killed.

543
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:22,734
We need you to come out.

544
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:29,032
The thing you talked about,
the creature...

545
00:39:29,741 --> 00:39:30,742
It's here.

546
00:39:34,037 --> 00:39:35,663
It killed some people.

547
00:39:59,187 --> 00:40:00,396
Wow.

548
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,776
He's so beautiful.

549
00:40:25,255 --> 00:40:26,881
<i>I sense...</i>

550
00:40:28,508 --> 00:40:31,302
<i>I sense my own.</i>

551
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:39,477
<i>And yet,</i>

552
00:40:39,561 --> 00:40:44,061
<i>the one Knull seeks is not here.</i>

553
00:40:45,859 --> 00:40:47,235
<i>Hmm.</i>

554
00:40:48,153 --> 00:40:49,863
<i>What does he seek?</i>

555
00:40:53,533 --> 00:40:55,076
<i>The black one.</i>

556
00:40:55,827 --> 00:40:56,994
<i>Brock's symbiote?</i>

557
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:00,457
He's the only one
who carries a codex.

558
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:06,629
<i>The end is Knull.</i>

559
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,889
You need your suit.

560
00:41:16,014 --> 00:41:18,391
Still worried
about giving this thing a cold?

561
00:41:19,142 --> 00:41:22,478
<i>Venom carries the key
to Knull's freedom.</i>

562
00:41:22,562 --> 00:41:25,106
He must never obtain it.

563
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,608
<i>Or your race will be killed.</i>

564
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,152
<i>You.</i>

565
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:32,322
And you.

566
00:41:32,864 --> 00:41:34,073
<i>And...</i>

567
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,576
you.

568
00:41:38,453 --> 00:41:41,622
<i>Everyone, everything.</i>

569
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:43,959
<i>How do we stop whatever's
up there from coming down here?</i>

570
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,794
<i>You can't.</i>

571
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:49,589
<i>He's older than the universe.</i>

572
00:41:49,881 --> 00:41:52,174
He needs the key.

573
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:57,343
<i>Then everything will end.</i>

574
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,852
<i>How do we stop him
from getting it?</i>

575
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:07,190
<i>If the symbiote
and the host are alive,</i>

576
00:42:08,066 --> 00:42:11,110
<i>then the codex is alive.</i>

577
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:14,739
And if one of them dies?

578
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,700
The codex dies.

579
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:19,118
<i>The codex dies.</i>

580
00:42:20,954 --> 00:42:23,414
- Rex, you can't be serious.
- Oh, I'm game.

581
00:42:23,498 --> 00:42:25,291
Destroying the codex
is the only way

582
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:27,168
it remains unobtainable. Right?

583
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,106
<i>Hey, buddy, I'm talking to you.</i>

584
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,339
Destroying it?

585
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:33,133
We have barely even
scratched the surface.

586
00:42:33,258 --> 00:42:34,968
My people are dead.

587
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:39,347
Something is coming
that cannot be beaten.

588
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,576
I'm stopping
all this shit right now.

589
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,851
Science is sacrifice.

590
00:42:42,934 --> 00:42:44,060
Teddy.

591
00:42:44,978 --> 00:42:46,854
This is serious.

592
00:42:46,938 --> 00:42:48,606
Listen to her.

593
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,446
Have you spoken
to your family recently?

594
00:43:38,865 --> 00:43:40,408
Is everything okay?

595
00:43:44,621 --> 00:43:45,622
Yeah.

596
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:51,461
<i>I smell wet dog.
And sausamages!</i>

597
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:52,796
Hey, friend-o.

598
00:43:53,421 --> 00:43:54,422
You okay, there?

599
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:58,426
No, I'm not okay.

600
00:43:58,510 --> 00:43:59,510
Uh...

601
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:01,346
It's pretty wild out there.

602
00:44:01,471 --> 00:44:03,222
- I know.
- Yeah.

603
00:44:03,306 --> 00:44:04,307
You hungry?

604
00:44:04,432 --> 00:44:05,933
Yes.

605
00:44:06,017 --> 00:44:07,018
Come over.

606
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:09,104
Thank you.

607
00:44:09,229 --> 00:44:12,190
- So this is my wife, Nova Moon.
- Hi.

608
00:44:12,315 --> 00:44:15,609
And these are my kids.
Echo and Leaf.

609
00:44:15,735 --> 00:44:17,695
- <i>A lifetime in therapy.</i>
- Don't.

610
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:18,947
Huh?

611
00:44:19,614 --> 00:44:24,114
Don't you dare! Wow.
How beautiful are your children.

612
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,412
And that's Blue.

613
00:44:27,747 --> 00:44:29,540
- Who is a...
- Dog.

614
00:44:29,666 --> 00:44:31,417
And I'm Martin.

615
00:44:31,501 --> 00:44:33,294
- Hey, Martin.
- Hey.

616
00:44:33,378 --> 00:44:34,379
I'm Eddie.

617
00:44:34,462 --> 00:44:36,302
- Nice to meet you, Eddie.
- You too. Pleasure.

618
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:40,093
- Come, sit, please. Come on.
- Okay. Thank you.

619
00:44:40,969 --> 00:44:42,428
Jesus Christ.

620
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:45,557
So, right.

621
00:44:46,099 --> 00:44:46,974
Oh.

622
00:44:47,058 --> 00:44:49,852
So nothing died on that plate.
Namaste, man.

623
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:52,021
- Thank you.
- <i>Hard pass!</i>

624
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,649
Oh, dear.

625
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:57,610
- Eddie, where you headed?
- New York.

626
00:44:57,694 --> 00:44:58,695
Oh, wow.

627
00:44:58,820 --> 00:44:59,820
- Yeah.
- All right.

628
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:02,866
Long way to New York
with naked shrimps, man.

629
00:45:02,991 --> 00:45:04,409
Yeah.

630
00:45:04,534 --> 00:45:06,661
We could ride you out to Vegas.

631
00:45:06,786 --> 00:45:07,787
Yeah.

632
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:10,248
<i>These people are weird,
I'm telling you.</i>

633
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:11,559
That would be so kind.
Thank you.

634
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:12,584
You're welcome.

635
00:45:12,667 --> 00:45:14,085
Of course.
Life's one big adventure.

636
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:15,569
Who doesn't love
making new friends?

637
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:16,796
- Right?
- Right?

638
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,091
This guy is so one of those
serial killer hitchhikers

639
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:22,051
from my favorite murder podcast.

640
00:45:22,135 --> 00:45:24,220
- <i>Ha-ha!</i>
- Baby. Not now.

641
00:45:24,346 --> 00:45:26,514
How has social services
not taken us away yet?

642
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:30,143
She... She...
She's joking.

643
00:45:30,268 --> 00:45:33,020
- I'm not.
- Please, honey.

644
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,149
So we're riding
the Extraterrestrial Highway.

645
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,484
- Yeah.
- The whatchamawhosit?

646
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:40,028
It's the road
that leads to Area 51.

647
00:45:40,153 --> 00:45:42,446
See if we can spot us an alien

648
00:45:42,572 --> 00:45:44,615
before they shut the place down
forever, you know?

649
00:45:44,741 --> 00:45:46,743
It's, uh,
it's my lifelong dream.

650
00:45:46,826 --> 00:45:48,244
<i>We could show him right now!</i>

651
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:49,329

813
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:22,192
I'm not sure 20 bucks
is gonna get us much

814
00:55:22,276 --> 00:55:24,111
in the way of a motor transport.

815
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:29,616
And I'm not ever riding
an alien horse again.

816
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:32,369
So I guess it looks like
we're stealing cars.

817
00:55:32,453 --> 00:55:33,996
<i>No, I've watched</i> Rain Man,

818
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,750
<i>and in my infinite wisdom
as a celestial being,</i>

819
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:40,294
<i>- working the system is easy.
- Uh...</i>

820
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:44,006
<i>We hit the slots,
then blackjack, then roulette!</i>

821
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:45,341
<i>Bingo-bango!</i>

822
00:55:45,466 --> 00:55:48,677
<i>Luxury ride,
Bluetooth sound system, AC</i>

823
00:55:48,761 --> 00:55:51,221
<i>and the top down.</i>

824
00:55:51,305 --> 00:55:53,557
<i>Because that's how we roll.</i>

825
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:55,601
Paris Casino
has a strict dress code.

826
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:01,690
No, you know what? It's a hotel.
These are my vacation clothes.

827
00:56:01,774 --> 00:56:03,108
Get better ones.

828
00:56:03,192 --> 00:56:05,235
<i>He's not wrong.
Look at you.</i>

829
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:08,948
Don't push it, all right, buddy?

830
00:56:09,782 --> 00:56:11,283
- <i>Want a hand?</i>
- Yes.

831
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:16,330
I didn't mean knock him out.
What are you doing?

832
00:56:16,414 --> 00:56:18,134
- He was <i>being a dick.</i>
- Yeah, but...

833
00:56:18,207 --> 00:56:19,875
<i>Oh! Look.</i>

834
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:24,922
<i>We need a disguise.</i>

835
00:56:26,924 --> 00:56:28,467
What are we doing?

836
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:30,135
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

837
00:56:30,261 --> 00:56:31,262
Hi.

838
00:56:34,181 --> 00:56:35,182
Oh God.

839
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:36,558
<i>Warm.</i>

840
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:44,400
Why do you keep
knocking people out?

841
00:56:44,483 --> 00:56:45,901
What is wrong with you?

842
00:56:45,985 --> 00:56:47,486
Jesus, why?

843
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:50,572
So sorry, buddy.

844
00:56:50,656 --> 00:56:52,824
I am so, so sorry.

845
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:55,286
<i>Eddie! Yeah, baby.</i>

846
00:56:55,369 --> 00:56:58,663
<i>Now no one will recognize us.</i>

847
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:00,499
<i>- Seriously.</i>

848
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:04,878
<i>You could get voted

849
00:57:04,962 --> 00:57:07,589
<i>if anyone cared
who you were anymore.</i>

850
00:57:07,673 --> 00:57:09,591
I've won Sexy Man awards before.

851
00:57:09,675 --> 00:57:10,717
<i>'Course you have.</i>

852
00:57:12,053 --> 00:57:13,471
- Hey. Hey.
- Yeah?

853
00:57:13,554 --> 00:57:14,721
The guy that did that?

854
00:57:14,805 --> 00:57:17,349
I saw it.
He's in the arch over there.

855
00:57:17,433 --> 00:57:18,953
- He's shitfaced.
- All right.

856
00:57:20,394 --> 00:57:21,978
We are bad people.

857
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:23,647
<i>Yeah, we are!</i>

858
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,608
We're keeping these shoes,
by the way.

859
00:57:27,276 --> 00:57:30,320
<i>We are so money, and we know it!</i>

860
00:57:30,404 --> 00:57:31,780
Welcome to the Paris.

861
00:57:31,864 --> 00:57:33,264
- Thank you.
- No, thank <i>you.</i>

862
00:57:33,324 --> 00:57:35,451
- Just sit on the ground.
- What happened?

863
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:40,539
<i>♪ Baby, here I am

<i>Oh, yes!</i>

868
00:57:51,842 --> 00:57:55,554
<i>Let me multiply that 20.
Let me quadruplify it.</i>

869
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,056
What are you doing?

870
00:57:57,932 --> 00:57:59,767
No. This is all the money
that we have.

871
00:57:59,892 --> 00:58:02,185
<i>♪ Luck, be a lady tonight ♪</i>

<i>Smashing jacket!
Let's eat him and steal it!</i>

874

<i>I know Lady Luck
is on our side tonight!</i>

875
00:58:15,783 --> 00:58:17,242
No, I would say that Lady Luck

876
00:58:17,326 --> 00:58:19,036
is definitely
not on your side tonight.

877
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,288
In fact, I would even
go so far to say

878
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:23,374
that Lady Luck hates you, buddy.

879
00:58:23,499 --> 00:58:26,293
- <i>I can't stop now!</i>
- Of course you can't stop.

880
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:27,479
<i>What is this feeling?</i>

881
00:58:27,503 --> 00:58:28,647
<i>- It's like: Aaah!</i>
- This feeling?

882
00:58:28,671 --> 00:58:30,714
<i>It's like all
of my problems have gone away!</i>

883
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,883

<i>I need more money.</i>

But we don't have
any more money, buddy.

887
00:58:45,187 --> 00:58:46,813
<i>Goddamn it!</i>

888
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:49,775
You are a sore loser.

889
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:51,818
- <i>You're a sore loser!</i>
- Oh...

890
00:58:52,653 --> 00:58:54,988
I think you broke my foot.

891
00:58:55,072 --> 00:58:57,741
<i>Ah!
Lady Luck is a fickle slut!</i>

<i>We should have played

893
00:59:02,371 --> 00:59:04,247
No effing way.

894
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:07,876
Eddie Brock?

895
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:10,295
- Mrs. Chen! That's not yours.

896
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:13,173
- I'm sorry.
- <i>Eddie! It's Mrs. Chen!</i>

897
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:14,776
- Oh, Mrs. Chen!

898
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:15,801
Eddie, baby!

899
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:18,220
Mrs. Chen!
Mrs. Chen! Mrs. Chen!

900
00:59:18,345 --> 00:59:20,388
- I'm <i>gonna cry.</i>
- Me too.

901
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:24,018
Wow. What happened to you?

902
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:25,144
You look hot!

903
00:59:25,227 --> 00:59:26,895
- So do you.
- <i>Really hot.</i>

904
00:59:26,979 --> 00:59:28,355
- I <i>always</i> look hot.
- Yeah.

905
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:30,191
- Is the big guy in there?
- Yeah.

906
00:59:30,316 --> 00:59:31,692
Do you like my dress?

907
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:33,277
I've been winning so big,
they gave me

908
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:34,588
a credit line
at the clothes store.

909
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:36,155
And then the penthouse suite!

910
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:40,492
Wow. You know I stole this suit
off a guy who pissed on me.

911
00:59:40,576 --> 00:59:42,703
I knocked him out.
I left him in a bush.

912
00:59:42,787 --> 00:59:44,663
Well, that explains the stink.

913
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:48,042
You could use my room
to clean up, and then we party.

914
00:59:48,167 --> 00:59:49,710
Oh, that would be so good.

915
00:59:49,835 --> 00:59:51,711
And room service.

916
00:59:51,837 --> 00:59:54,214
<i>Oh, yes!</i>

917
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:07,102
We got him.
Positive ID on Brock.

918
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:10,940
CCTV hit,
the Paris Hotel, Vegas.

919
01:00:11,023 --> 01:00:13,525
- Have we reconstituted The Six?
- Yes, sir.

920
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:15,319
Put 'em in.

921
01:00:29,166 --> 01:00:31,668
- The Six are en route.

922
01:00:31,752 --> 01:00:33,253
They'll bring him in.

923
01:00:34,421 --> 01:00:38,383
At this time, I'm requesting
control of the Imperium Program.

924
01:00:41,053 --> 01:00:42,804
You have my permission, general.

<i>When thunder roars,
head indoors.</i>

926
01:01:15,337 --> 01:01:16,629
Let's dance, baby.

927
01:01:16,755 --> 01:01:19,132
- No. <i>No.</i>
<i>- Yeah! I love dancing!</i>

928
01:01:19,216 --> 01:01:21,801
Are you crazy?
That thing will find us.

929
01:01:21,927 --> 01:01:22,969
Don't be a party pooper.

930
01:01:23,095 --> 01:01:25,806
No! Do not encourage him.

931
01:01:25,931 --> 01:01:26,932
You know what, Mrs. Chen?

932
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:28,684
We are fugitives.
We are on the run.

933
01:01:28,767 --> 01:01:31,394
So, thank you for having us.
We gotta go.

934
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:32,747
- <i>You're no fun!</i>

935
01:01:32,771 --> 01:01:34,898

- What?

938
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:39,069
Just a little dance.

939
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:43,032

Area 51.

972
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:14,850
- Yeah.
- Huh?

973
01:04:14,975 --> 01:04:16,184
Yeah.

974
01:04:17,853 --> 01:04:19,271
We made it.

975
01:04:22,691 --> 01:04:24,192
You finally got to see it, Dad.

976
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:26,861
It's kind of cool...

977
01:04:27,738 --> 01:04:29,030
I guess.

978
01:04:29,948 --> 01:04:30,949
Yeah.

979
01:04:34,161 --> 01:04:35,162
Leaf.

980
01:04:36,413 --> 01:04:38,039
Where you goin', hon?

981
01:04:38,749 --> 01:04:40,500
Well, let's see
if we can't find us

982
01:04:40,584 --> 01:04:42,377
something cooler. Come on.

983
01:04:42,503 --> 01:04:43,587
Come on, guys.

984
01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:46,005
Okay, babe.
Lifelong dream.

985
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:47,716
All right. Go, go, go, go, go!

986
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:49,884
I smell alien.

987
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:58,185
He's deteriorating
without his host.

988
01:04:59,019 --> 01:05:00,186
Poor thing.

989
01:05:01,355 --> 01:05:03,190
Put him below with the others.

990
01:05:03,273 --> 01:05:04,607
Safer there.

991
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:42,813
Down, down.
Come on, come on.

992
01:05:51,196 --> 01:05:54,199
All right.
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

993
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:58,829
I think we're gonna get
a better view from up there.

994
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:02,332
Follow me, guys. Come on.

995
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:04,376
This is so exciting.

996
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:06,086
I can't believe we're here.

997
01:06:19,683 --> 01:06:20,892
Wow.

998
01:06:24,438 --> 01:06:27,399
Wow. Oh, wow.

999
01:06:29,026 --> 01:06:30,569
What is this?

1000
01:06:41,705 --> 01:06:43,373
It's all broken.

1001
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:46,167
So sad.

1002
01:06:58,764 --> 01:07:00,098
Buddy?

1003
01:07:01,308 --> 01:07:02,642
Hey, buddy?

1004
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:07,356
Oh no.

1005
01:07:07,439 --> 01:07:09,232
Oh...

1006
01:07:09,316 --> 01:07:10,400
No.

1007
01:07:12,945 --> 01:07:17,074
Oh, my God, how many hangovers
can you have in one day'?

1008
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:19,867
<i>Eddie?</i>

1009
01:07:24,957 --> 01:07:26,166
Hello?

1010
01:07:28,669 --> 01:07:30,128
<i>They did this to me.</i>

1011
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:34,007
<i>Mulligan?</i>

1012
01:07:35,175 --> 01:07:36,176
<i>Why?</i>

1013
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:37,386
You're alive?

1014
01:07:38,845 --> 01:07:40,429
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

1015
01:07:42,683 --> 01:07:44,393
<i>We're being hunted, Eddie.</i>

1016
01:07:45,185 --> 01:07:47,562
You have what he needs.

1017
01:07:49,189 --> 01:07:52,984
Protect the codex
from dark hands.

1018
01:07:53,735 --> 01:07:57,447
A symbiote army waits here.

1019
01:07:57,531 --> 01:07:59,074
Free them.

1020
01:08:00,117 --> 01:08:01,535
Protect it, Eddie.

1021
01:08:02,536 --> 01:08:03,537
Knull...

1022
01:08:04,788 --> 01:08:08,082
must stay locked away.

1023
01:08:12,838 --> 01:08:14,256
Eddie, I'm Dr. Paine.

1024
01:08:16,967 --> 01:08:17,968
<i>Where's my friend?</i>

1025
01:08:18,093 --> 01:08:19,177
<i>He's safe for now.</i>

1026
01:08:20,846 --> 01:08:21,847
Great news!

1027
01:08:21,972 --> 01:08:24,099
- Oh <i>shit.</i>
- We're all done here.

1028
01:08:24,224 --> 01:08:26,267
All of this
is out of your hands.

1029
01:08:26,393 --> 01:08:27,560
This is my lab.

1030
01:08:27,686 --> 01:08:29,896
No, no, not yours.
You just work here.

1031
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:31,106
Or you did.

1032
01:08:31,189 --> 01:08:32,899
You, Christmas,
you're going home.

1033
01:08:33,483 --> 01:08:34,859
And what about them?

1034
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:36,170
- You heard what it said.
- Hands up.

1035
01:08:36,194 --> 01:08:37,945
The codex only exists
if they're both alive.

1036
01:08:38,071 --> 01:08:39,405
Yeah, we're good. We're good.

1037
01:08:40,699 --> 01:08:42,158
You killed one of my people.

1038
01:08:42,242 --> 01:08:44,053
I'm returning the favor
personally. Please escort

1039
01:08:44,077 --> 01:08:45,138
- Dr. Paine out of here.
- No.

1040
01:08:45,162 --> 01:08:46,163
<i>- Don't move.</i>
- Christmas!

1041
01:08:46,246 --> 01:08:47,288
Time to go.

1042
01:08:47,414 --> 01:08:48,498
- Hey!

1043
01:08:57,924 --> 01:08:59,300
Big mistake.

1044
01:09:06,016 --> 01:09:07,892
- Fire!
- Run!

1045
01:09:12,147 --> 01:09:13,907
- Oh my God!
- Fall back, fall back!

1046
01:09:14,566 --> 01:09:15,733
- Go!

1047
01:09:20,614 --> 01:09:22,991
- Venom, run. Go!

1048
01:09:30,707 --> 01:09:33,876
Let's go! Move! Clear! Clear!

1049
01:09:35,796 --> 01:09:37,380
Release the symbiotes!

1050
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:38,650
- Go! Go!

1051
01:09:46,973 --> 01:09:48,683
- Come on.
- Go! Go!

1052
01:10:01,279 --> 01:10:02,280
Hurry up! Move!

1053
01:10:03,031 --> 01:10:04,032
Get back!

1054
01:10:04,324 --> 01:10:05,324
Ah!

1055
01:10:05,409 --> 01:10:06,660
Jim!

1056
01:10:07,953 --> 01:10:08,995
Ah!

1057
01:10:20,674 --> 01:10:21,800
Let's go.

1058
01:10:21,925 --> 01:10:23,051
Take her down.

1059
01:10:49,369 --> 01:10:50,620
Ah!

1060
01:10:56,334 --> 01:10:57,835
Come on!

1061
01:11:04,050 --> 01:11:05,968
Get the codex out of here.

1062
01:11:13,185 --> 01:11:14,225
That's our way out.

1063
01:11:24,988 --> 01:11:27,198
You, break us out of here!

1064
01:11:31,203 --> 01:11:33,413
- There's no aliens here, kids.
- Hmm.

1065
01:11:37,959 --> 01:11:40,002
<i>Best shoes ever!</i>

1066
01:11:40,128 --> 01:11:42,255
Whoa! What was that?

1067
01:11:47,093 --> 01:11:49,053
- Okay.
- We gotta go! Move it!

1068
01:11:57,354 --> 01:11:58,355
We are leaving!

1069
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,023
Move!

1070
01:12:00,106 --> 01:12:01,357
Move, move!

1071
01:12:04,194 --> 01:12:05,904
- Dad.
- It's all right, kids.

1072
01:12:11,701 --> 01:12:14,495
Aliens! Alien invasion!

1073
01:12:14,996 --> 01:12:16,330
Alien attack!

1074
01:12:25,173 --> 01:12:27,091
Motherfucker!

1075
01:12:32,389 --> 01:12:34,283
- You two, get airborne!
- Right away, sir!

1076
01:12:34,307 --> 01:12:35,349
On me!

1077
01:12:35,433 --> 01:12:38,978
Hurry up, airborne! Move, move,
move! In the Hummers! Go!

1078
01:12:39,104 --> 01:12:40,206
<i>We've got to get the codex</i>

1079
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:41,439
<i>as far away as possible.</i>

1080
01:12:44,317 --> 01:12:45,985
- It's Eddie?
- It's Eddie.

1081
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:48,196
- Eddie! Hey!
- Eddie!

1082
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:49,739
- Oh, no.
- Eddie, Eddie!

1083
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:54,953
Martin. And family.

1084
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:01,000
You can't be here, Martin.

1085
01:13:01,126 --> 01:13:02,877
Dark forces, man.

1086
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:22,480
Eddie, can you help us?

1087
01:13:23,148 --> 01:13:25,650
I lied. Aliens are real.

1088
01:13:25,775 --> 01:13:27,902
My best friend
in the whole world is one.

1089
01:13:27,986 --> 01:13:29,338
He's gonna get you
out of here, okay?

1090
01:13:29,362 --> 01:13:30,946
Okay.

1091
01:13:32,616 --> 01:13:35,952
- Don't... Don't be scared.
- Hi.

1092
01:13:36,036 --> 01:13:37,037
Wow.

1093
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:40,039
- Pleasure to meet you.

1094
01:13:40,123 --> 01:13:41,958
Thanks for the chocolate.

1095
01:13:42,751 --> 01:13:44,419
- You're welcome.

1096
01:13:51,676 --> 01:13:54,804
Ah!

1097
01:13:59,476 --> 01:14:00,602
No!

1098
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:05,148
Mom, Dad!

1099
01:14:13,657 --> 01:14:14,699
Dad!

1100
01:14:14,824 --> 01:14:16,283
Hold on, kids!

1101
01:14:19,412 --> 01:14:20,955
Hold on, kids!

1102
01:14:24,042 --> 01:14:25,626
Eddie!

1103
01:14:36,721 --> 01:14:39,932
He was trying to protect you.

1104
01:14:40,016 --> 01:14:42,810
We are not the bad guys!

1105
01:14:46,272 --> 01:14:47,773
Echo! Leaf.

1106
01:14:47,857 --> 01:14:49,108
- My baby, my baby.
- Mom!

1107
01:14:49,234 --> 01:14:50,860
- Thank you, Eddie.
- You're welcome.

1108
01:14:55,490 --> 01:14:56,741
You gotta be kidding me.

1109
01:15:06,084 --> 01:15:07,627
Get in!

1110
01:15:07,752 --> 01:15:08,961
Run. Run.

1111
01:15:09,045 --> 01:15:10,379
Run!

1112
01:15:12,382 --> 01:15:13,383
Eddie!

1113
01:15:27,731 --> 01:15:29,733
Go. Bring me that codex.

1114
01:15:34,279 --> 01:15:35,446
What's that noise?

1115
01:15:35,572 --> 01:15:37,699
<i>She phoned home.</i>

1116
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:43,996
Oh shit.

1117
01:16:06,269 --> 01:16:09,021
- Jesus!
- Get down! Get down! Get under!

1118
01:16:09,105 --> 01:16:11,482
Take cover! Take cover!
I got you.

1119
01:16:22,035 --> 01:16:23,953
<i>She saved us.</i>

1120
01:16:25,246 --> 01:16:27,373
There's only one thing
that's gonna distract them.

1121
01:16:27,457 --> 01:16:28,583
<i>Copy.</i>

1122
01:16:32,003 --> 01:16:33,671
- Get 'em back to their van!
- What?

1123
01:16:33,797 --> 01:16:35,632
Come on! Hurry, hurry!

1124
01:16:37,884 --> 01:16:40,219
I'm gonna round them up.
Have the chopper follow me.

1125
01:16:42,597 --> 01:16:44,515
- Go, go, go! Go!

1126
01:16:58,029 --> 01:16:59,447
Go!

1127
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:03,117
He's leading them to a kill box.

1128
01:17:03,201 --> 01:17:05,161
When you get a lock,
vaporize 'em!

1129
01:17:29,602 --> 01:17:32,229
We're home. We're back.
Okay, okay. Hold it.

1130
01:17:32,856 --> 01:17:34,440
- Run!
- Go, kids! Go! Come on!

1131
01:17:34,566 --> 01:17:36,401
- Hurry. Hurry, honey.

1132
01:17:36,526 --> 01:17:38,110
Thank you!

1133
01:17:39,696 --> 01:17:41,239
Aliens suck!

1134
01:18:05,263 --> 01:18:06,703
- Light 'em up!
- <i>Copy that.</i>

1135
01:18:18,860 --> 01:18:20,194
<i>Target eliminated.</i>

1136
01:18:23,615 --> 01:18:25,283

Thompson down!

1138
01:18:26,868 --> 01:18:28,744
It's coming down. Go!

1139
01:18:45,553 --> 01:18:46,554
Slide!

1140
01:18:51,476 --> 01:18:52,852
Oh Sh...!

1141
01:18:52,936 --> 01:18:54,812
Oh! Go away!

1142
01:19:03,655 --> 01:19:04,989
Let's finish this.

1143
01:19:05,114 --> 01:19:06,782
<i>With pleasure.</i>

1144
01:19:12,997 --> 01:19:14,623

1145
01:19:36,896 --> 01:19:38,063
I got you.

1146
01:19:43,653 --> 01:19:45,738
- It's okay.
- Get him somewhere safe.

1147
01:19:48,241 --> 01:19:49,242
Oh God.

1148
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:16,435
I'm so sorry! I'm sorry!

1149
01:20:17,270 --> 01:20:18,646
Okay. Okay.

1150
01:20:38,416 --> 01:20:39,750
No.

1151
01:20:41,878 --> 01:20:43,713
Okay. Okay.

1152
01:20:47,759 --> 01:20:49,886
Still living
your brother's dream?

1153
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:58,352
Oh, my God.

1154
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:05,818
- I'm coming! I'm coming!
- Dad, come on!

1155
01:21:05,902 --> 01:21:08,154
Dad! Dad! Run! Come on!

1156
01:21:35,848 --> 01:21:37,432
I'm proud of you, Eddie.

1157
01:21:37,558 --> 01:21:39,268
You did it all yourself.

1158
01:21:40,895 --> 01:21:42,354
Well, some of it.

1159
01:21:58,830 --> 01:22:01,415
I really would have liked
to have seen her.

1160
01:22:06,796 --> 01:22:07,838
Who?

1161
01:22:08,506 --> 01:22:10,007
Lady Liberty.

1162
01:22:11,050 --> 01:22:12,384
Oh, yeah.

1163
01:22:13,594 --> 01:22:16,888
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, well, we're going.

1164
01:22:17,849 --> 01:22:20,184
We're gonna go just as soon
as we get...

1165
01:22:21,436 --> 01:22:22,603
out of here.

1166
01:22:24,522 --> 01:22:26,857
They're just going
to keep coming.

1167
01:22:26,941 --> 01:22:29,109
We'll never leave
this place, friend.

1168
01:22:40,913 --> 01:22:42,372
Okay, well...

1169
01:22:45,042 --> 01:22:47,878
I thought we were gonna be
the Lethal Protector.

1170
01:22:51,466 --> 01:22:53,301
We are.

1171
01:22:54,177 --> 01:22:55,887
That's what this is.

1172
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:07,273
Yeah.

1173
01:23:32,965 --> 01:23:33,966
All right.

1174
01:23:38,387 --> 01:23:39,638
All right.

1175
01:23:50,858 --> 01:23:52,150
Come and get us.

1176
01:24:56,465 --> 01:24:58,341
-Huh?

1177
01:24:58,467 --> 01:24:59,885
Go.

1178
01:24:59,969 --> 01:25:00,970
Go.

1179
01:25:07,226 --> 01:25:09,228
- Oh, my God.

1180
01:25:19,822 --> 01:25:20,823
What are you doin'?

1181
01:25:24,285 --> 01:25:26,036
I'll never forget you.

1182
01:25:29,832 --> 01:25:32,876
Don't forget me either, Eddie.

1183
01:25:33,002 --> 01:25:34,169
No.

1184
01:25:34,295 --> 01:25:35,671
Time to go.

1185
01:25:38,883 --> 01:25:40,050
Strickland.

1186
01:25:40,134 --> 01:25:41,445
<i>Strickland authorized.</i>

1187
01:25:43,304 --> 01:25:44,305

1188
01:26:02,573 --> 01:26:03,448
Strickland.

1189

Huh? Huh?

1192
01:26:28,140 --> 01:26:30,183
It's just bye for now.

1193
01:26:49,829 --> 01:26:50,871
No.

1194
01:26:50,955 --> 01:26:51,956
No!

1195
01:26:52,039 --> 01:26:53,457
No! No!

1196
01:27:28,534 --> 01:27:29,576
Go!

1197
01:27:57,521 --> 01:27:59,105
No, Eddie!

1198
01:27:59,899 --> 01:28:01,942
Eddie!

1199
01:28:02,026 --> 01:28:03,027
Oh, my God.

1200
01:28:52,701 --> 01:28:54,202
Nierika.

1201
01:29:19,019 --> 01:29:20,353
<i>Hey, buddy.</i>

1202
01:29:22,314 --> 01:29:24,149
I just had a crazy dream.

1203
01:29:31,615 --> 01:29:32,616
Buddy?

1204
01:29:32,741 --> 01:29:34,325
He's not coming back.

1205
01:29:42,585 --> 01:29:44,211
But I need him back.

1206
01:29:45,004 --> 01:29:47,214
He wasn't meant for this place.

1207
01:29:47,298 --> 01:29:49,008
You couldn't have kept him...

1208
01:29:49,967 --> 01:29:51,468
and he couldn't have kept you.

1209
01:29:53,804 --> 01:29:54,971
For your bravery,

1210
01:29:55,055 --> 01:29:58,308
you both have the heartfelt
thanks of a grateful nation.

1211
01:30:00,853 --> 01:30:02,771
Eddie, you're free
to start your life again.

1212
01:30:03,647 --> 01:30:05,732
Everything that happened
in San Francisco

1213
01:30:05,816 --> 01:30:07,400
and in the last few days...

1214
01:30:08,027 --> 01:30:09,778
consider it expunged.

1215
01:30:16,452 --> 01:30:18,871
Just so you're clear,
of course...

1216
01:30:18,954 --> 01:30:21,748
you ever breathe a word of this
to any living soul

1217
01:30:21,874 --> 01:30:24,501
you will spend
the rest of <i>that</i> life

1218
01:30:24,585 --> 01:30:27,504
