3
00:02:19,583 --> 00:02:21,458
There's only one here.

4
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:23,333
They were forged as a pair.

5
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:26,208
We'll keep looking for it.
It must be buried elsewhere.

6
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:27,542
Elsewhere?

7
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,792
Like where?

8
00:02:45,417 --> 00:02:48,417
Kamala! Are you doing
your homework, beta?

9
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,708
Yeah! Science!

10
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:01,208
Boom!

11
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:03,250
Enter, Kamala Khan.

12
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,583
Ready for...

13
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,500
Captain Marvel.

14
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:09,792
She needs my help.

15
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,375
Shine on, baby.

16
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,083
Why are hands so hard to draw?

17
00:03:18,667 --> 00:03:21,667
Okay, Ms. Marvel arrives,
and just in time...

18
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:23,542
...'cause even the Avengers need backup,
ya know?

19
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,167
Wham! Kapow!

20
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:30,083
This is my chance!

21
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:34,000
Pow!

22
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,708
Boom!

23
00:03:38,417 --> 00:03:39,333
Not bad, kid.

24
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:42,500
What's your name?

25
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:43,625
Ms. Marvel.

26
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Dude.

27
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,167
Twinsies!

28
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,625
Hey, you wanna go party with the Avengers?

29
00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:51,417
Uh... Yeah!

30
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:53,792
Can you fly?

31
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,917
No, but I can do this!

32
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,500
Kamala! Don't make me come up there!

33
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,583
-That does not sound like science to me.
-Okay.

34
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,500
You don't remember anything?

35
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:33,500
I see...

36
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,083
flashes.

37
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:38,375
Little moments.

38
00:04:38,917 --> 00:04:41,583
If I could just piece together
what happened that morning...

39
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:43,833
maybe it'll all make sense.

40
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:56,542
You stole me from my home,
my family, my friends.

41
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,917
Lieutenant Trouble.

42
00:04:58,583 --> 00:05:00,542
-Higher, further, faster, baby.
-That's right.

43
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,000
Tell the Supreme Intelligence
that I'm coming to end it.

44
00:05:04,792 --> 00:05:06,667
The war, the lies.

45
00:05:07,542 --> 00:05:08,417
All of it.

46
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:09,667
You can't do this.

47
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,375
I'll be back before you know it.

48
00:05:11,542 --> 00:05:13,167
I could fly up and meet you halfway.

49
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:15,792
Only if you learn to glow
like your Auntie Carol.

50
00:05:48,625 --> 00:05:49,958
Come here, Goosey.

51
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,750
Incoming call from Nick Fury.

52
00:05:54,917 --> 00:05:56,125
You expecting a call?

53
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,625
Maybe we just send it to voice mail.

54
00:06:02,667 --> 00:06:03,917
Nick Fury...

55
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:06,583
my favorite one-eyed man of intrigue.

56
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,792
Carol Danvers.

57
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,833
Prodigal child of the Milky Way.

58
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,167
How goes it out there?

59
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,583
Thriving.

60
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,208
What the hell was that?

61
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,083
-Goose?
-Yeah.

62
00:06:18,042 --> 00:06:18,875
What about you?

63
00:06:19,042 --> 00:06:20,083
How are you doing?

64
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:23,667
What do you know about the surge
in the jump point system a few hours ago?

65
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:26,583
I didn't notice anything unusual.

66
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,125
I'll take a look now.

67
00:06:28,292 --> 00:06:29,417
It rattled the whole system.

68
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,083
We're trying to get a handle on
what happened.

69
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,625
The entire network was affected?

70
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:34,875
Yeah. End to end.

71
00:06:35,042 --> 00:06:36,458
Thankfully, our neural network team...

72
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:39,750
was able to trace the origin back to
MB-418.

73
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:42,292
-You're in the neighborhood, right?
-Yeah.

74
00:06:42,917 --> 00:06:43,958
Can you check it out?

75
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:46,750
-I'm on it.
-Appreciate you.

76
00:06:46,917 --> 00:06:49,792
Monica and her team
will send more intel as they acquire it.

77
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,542
Monica?

78
00:06:51,708 --> 00:06:53,667
What's she doing there?
I thought that she was on Earth.

79
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:56,042
-Is she okay?
-Yeah.

80
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:58,500
And she's not that
little kid you remember.

81
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,458
So, do we think that
we can finish this before dinner?

82
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:18,958
Yeah. I don't think we're gonna fix it

83
00:07:19,083 --> 00:07:21,625
in time to get a reading
on the jump point.

84
00:07:21,792 --> 00:07:25,208
But I do know someone with superpowers
who could.

85
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:26,792
Oh.

86
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,375
Fine. I'll go.

87
00:07:29,542 --> 00:07:31,417
You guys head in
and check the status of the network.

88
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:34,542
We've gotta find this damage
and see if we can reverse it.

89
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:35,917
Aye, aye, Captain.

90
00:08:06,292 --> 00:08:07,167
Fury...

91
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:08,958
I think I found something.

92
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,292
Communications override.

93
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:13,250
Captain Rambeau. Spacewalk.

94
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:14,625
Connected.

95
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:16,458
Rambeau...

96
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:17,917
what the hell are you doin'?

97
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:22,083
Seems the surge has had
some residual effect on the jump point.

98
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,833
I'm gonna get you some readings, Fury.

99
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,875
Mon...

100
00:08:25,042 --> 00:08:26,625
-Hello?
-Monica.

101
00:08:26,792 --> 00:08:27,792
Hello?

102
00:08:35,332 --> 00:08:36,292
Was that Monica?

103
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,167
-Aunt Carol?
-Fury...

104
00:08:38,332 --> 00:08:40,417
-was that Monica?
-Why, you wanna talk to her?

105
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:43,000
I don't think I'm in the best...

106
00:08:43,167 --> 00:08:45,875
position to... I... I don't...

107
00:08:46,042 --> 00:08:47,292
I don't wanna...

108
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,292
Look...

109
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:49,708
I don't wanna talk to her like this.

110
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,917
-Not after all this time.
-You know...

111
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,417
-eventually you're gonna have to talk to her.
-I know.

112
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:55,542
I know, but...

113
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,917
let's save the family reunions
till I'm back inside.

114
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:09,000
I think I found the source of the surge.

115
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,958
What are you seeing?

116
00:09:12,542 --> 00:09:16,208
It's a jump point,
but it's not closing. Like...

117
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,250
it's stuck.

118
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:19,417
Danvers.

119
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:34,458
Danvers.

120
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:36,667
Danvers!

121
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,833
The jump point's still leaking energy.

122
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,458
-Captain Rambeau?
-Hello?

123
00:09:47,417 --> 00:09:49,542
-Hello?
-Monica.

124
00:09:57,417 --> 00:09:58,708
Beautiful.

125
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,750
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!

126
00:10:40,167 --> 00:10:42,292
Stop spinning, stop spinning, stop spinning,
please!

127
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:51,833
It's Nick Fury! Hey!

128
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,208
How did you... Oh, wow.

129
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:57,583
I'm Kamala Khan.
No, sorry, I'm Ms. Marvel, actually.

130
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,000
But I'm from Jersey City and I...

131
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:01,292
Oh, no, I don't have my mask on.

132
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,583
Is this an Avengers test?

133
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:06,292
Who the hell are you?

134
00:11:35,917 --> 00:11:37,417
Hi.

135
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:38,667
Really good living room.

136
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,167
-Kamala?
-Kamala?

137
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:52,875
What did you do to me?

138
00:11:53,042 --> 00:11:55,208
-What is Dar-Benn doing?
-It's too late.

139
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:58,125
The Supremor's already on Tarnax.

140
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,125
You can't stop this.

141
00:12:00,292 --> 00:12:01,500
Watch me.

142
00:12:15,542 --> 00:12:17,333
Fury. It's the Kree.

143
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,292
They're going after the Skrulls on Tarnax.

144
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:22,667
Now, hold on.
Do not go in swinging.

145
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,167
-This is a peace and reconciliation tour.
-Fury.

146
00:12:25,333 --> 00:12:27,083
-I got this.
-Carol...

147
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,333
So, I switched with someone
named Kamala Khan?

148
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,542
Yeah.
She seemed to be as confused as you are.

149
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,750
Well, there's nothing in her power-set
about teleportation.

150
00:12:36,917 --> 00:12:37,875
Enough about her.

151
00:12:38,042 --> 00:12:40,500
I wanna know what happened
to you on MB-418.

152
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:42,333
Yes, sir.

153
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,917
Let me preface this by saying
I'm not really sure. But...

154
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:48,125
I did not break my closet door, okay?
I was in space.

155
00:12:48,292 --> 00:12:51,792
-Oh, so it broke itself?
-No, no, no. See, I disappeared.

156
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,917
So maybe Captain Marvel broke it.

157
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,458
-What?
-Yes, your friend, Captain Marvel.

158
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:59,542
She was walking up and down
our living room...

159
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:00,708
and now you come back...

160
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:04,625
-waltzing in with no apologies.
-I'm sorry, Captain Marvel was in our house?

161
00:13:04,792 --> 00:13:07,625
Is Captain Marvel pressuring you in any way?

162
00:13:08,042 --> 00:13:11,292
Look, I understand that she's
an important figure and all that...

163
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:12,625
but you don't have to do as she says.

164
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,917
No, no, they're clearly working together.

165
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:16,583
-Look at her face. Look at her smile.
-Aamir, stop it.

166
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,833
-She's being super secretive as always.
-Aamir, stop picking on your sister.

167
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,042
-Look at her.
-Muneeba.

168
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,667
Kamala, are you lying again?

169
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,750
-Just tell me if you're involved or...
-My daughter has said she's not lying.

170
00:13:23,917 --> 00:13:24,917
-Kamala.
-Looks like she's having...

171
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,083
-so much fun.
-Muneeba...

172
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,667
-She's bad at keeping secrets.
-Oh, my God! It's happening!

173
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,958
Approaching Tarnax.

174
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:43,458
Warning.

175
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,083
Kree ship detected.

176
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,917
This is not what we agreed, Dar-Benn.

177
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,292
Supremor Dar-Benn.

178
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,417
The Skrull...

179
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:40,792
have been scattered
to every corner of the universe.

180
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:44,125
Made refugees wherever we go, and still...

181
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:48,917
we came into these negotiations
in good faith.

182
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:50,917
I hear you, Dro'ge.

183
00:14:52,417 --> 00:14:56,333
I, perhaps more than anyone, understand what
you and your people have been through.

184
00:14:56,917 --> 00:14:59,750
After my predecessor was destroyed...

185
00:14:59,917 --> 00:15:02,167
heretics rose up to fill the void.

186
00:15:04,042 --> 00:15:07,750
The Civil War has polluted our skies.
My people cannot breathe.

187
00:15:10,292 --> 00:15:11,750
Our sun is dying.

188
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,417
Hala is out of time.

189
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,167
I hope we can rebuild together.

190
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,417
So much so that I'm willing
to put our ancient animosities behind us.

191
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,250
And give you a chance to protect your people.

192
00:15:27,042 --> 00:15:28,375
To stop running.

193
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:35,500
The Skrull will take their rightful place
in the Kree Empire.

194
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,542
And I will aid in their relocation.

195
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,167
-Relocation?
-What?

196
00:15:41,917 --> 00:15:43,792
-What?
-What is the meaning of this?

197
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:49,167
I would hate for your people to suffocate
when I strip the atmosphere.

198
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,333
It's the Annihilator!

199
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,500
Oh, my God!

200
00:16:36,542 --> 00:16:39,333
-What the hell is going on?
-Yes, what the hell is going on?

201
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,333
I was on some freaky spaceship
and then I teleported here.

202
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,458
I don't know if that's my new power.

203
00:16:42,625 --> 00:16:44,750
-And then this freaking cat ate a man.
-How can a cat eat a man, Kamala?

204
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:45,833
I don't know. It has tentacles...

205
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:46,958
-and it ate a man.
-What tentacles, Kamala?

206
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,042
-I don't know.
-Where are the tentacles?

207
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:49,500
It comes out of his mouth,
and they're...

208
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,625
-Oh, my God!
-Oh!

209
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:54,167
Oh, my God,
it's happening again!

210
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,042
-Oh, no, no, no.
-Kamala, who are they?

211
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:05,708
Please run.

212
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,416
How did you get here,
and how're you involved in this?

213
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:16,041
-The Kree jury-rigged a wormhole on MB-418.
-You mean like a jump point?

214
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:19,791
-I don't know. But I touched it and then I...
-Why'd you do that?

215
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:21,333
Because it was glowing and mysterious.

216
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:24,958
Okay, new rule, no more touching shit.
Especially glowing, mysterious shit.

217
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,625
Okay, I'm feeling a lot of
negative energy from you...

218
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:28,750
and I don't like it. That's not the point.
The point is...

219
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:32,000
is that it was siphoning off
the atmosphere. And it did this!

220
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:33,333
Scissors beat paper.

221
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:36,917
Fury! There was, like,
energy that went around my hand. Focus.

222
00:17:37,417 --> 00:17:38,500
Okay, maybe if I do this.

223
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:46,750
Annihilator.

224
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:47,958
I don't like that name.

225
00:18:20,292 --> 00:18:22,333
-Friends of yours?
-Hi.

226
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:50,000
Annihilator!

227
00:19:10,292 --> 00:19:11,792
Annihilator!

228
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:44,750
Aamir, get him!

229
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,458
Get him! Hit him!

230
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:03,333
Yusuf!

231
00:20:11,292 --> 00:20:15,000
Let me go! Let me go! Let me go!

232
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,375
Kamala, are you okay?

233
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:38,750
Fury!

234
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:42,417
I think I'm getting teleported whenever I
channel any kind of radiant...

235
00:20:44,917 --> 00:20:46,542
I think I switch when I use my powers.

236
00:20:46,708 --> 00:20:47,875
Strong theory.

237
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,083
Strong theory.

238
00:20:57,667 --> 00:21:00,583
Our tests keep generating the same result.

239
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:05,083
With each new jump point,
this band becomes more unstable.

240
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,708
I strongly suggest we wait
for the second band.

241
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:58,375
Oi.

242
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:01,792
Hi, again.

243
00:22:02,667 --> 00:22:04,750
So sorry about earlier.

244
00:22:04,917 --> 00:22:06,500
We're looking for Kamala Khan.

245
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:08,792
Did I get in?

246
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:12,333
-Is this the new iPad? I haven't seen it yet.
-They wish!

247
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,458
-All right. Come on, let's go.
-I know. Wait...

248
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:16,375
if this is all top secret information,
why is it on a clear case?

249
00:22:16,542 --> 00:22:17,375
Well...

250
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,208
just... swipe it a little bit... Hi.

251
00:22:20,375 --> 00:22:23,292
-Okay.
-Can you believe it? They have intel on me.

252
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:24,583
On me!

253
00:22:25,333 --> 00:22:26,500
I am intel.

254
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:27,917
Look at you!

255
00:22:29,583 --> 00:22:31,542
Hey, what does S.A.B.E.R. stand for?

256
00:22:31,708 --> 00:22:33,458
Strategic Aerospace Biophysics...

257
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:36,167
-and Exolinguistic Response.
-That's classified.

258
00:22:36,542 --> 00:22:37,542
Sorry.

259
00:22:38,417 --> 00:22:40,000
"Hard Light powers,"
yes.

260
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:42,500
-"Noor..."
-Okay, but why do you have intel on her?

261
00:22:42,667 --> 00:22:44,375
Is there some sort of surveillance on us?

262
00:22:44,542 --> 00:22:46,833
-"Surveillance" is a strong word.
-Well, ma'am...

263
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,958
your daughter is the hero
that saved Jersey City.

264
00:22:50,292 --> 00:22:53,125
So, of course we would have intel
on someone like her. And you're also...

265
00:22:53,292 --> 00:22:55,708
-electromagnetically altered.
-What does that mean?

266
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,458
Oh, it just means that we both have...

267
00:22:58,625 --> 00:23:00,375
light-based powers.

268
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,833
What's your code name?

269
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,417
Oh, I don't have a code name.

270
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:05,958
-We'll workshop it.
-No, thank you.

271
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:07,833
Aunt Carol...

272
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,708
Captain Marvel also has light-based powers.

273
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:12,250
It's probably not a coincidence.

274
00:23:12,417 --> 00:23:15,333
Not to mention the two of you
came into direct contact...

275
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,208
with some malfunctioning jump points.

276
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:21,375
I still cannot believe that Captain Marvel
was here and I didn't even get to meet her.

277
00:23:21,542 --> 00:23:22,958
You know, we're supposed to be
all, like "twinsies!" you know.

278
00:23:23,125 --> 00:23:25,875
We have the same name.
I would obviously, then...

279
00:23:26,042 --> 00:23:28,083
I don't know, I would just give her
the letter I wrote for her...

280
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,167
and we would go out for lunch,
and then it would just...

281
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:33,167
Did you say "Aunt Carol?"

282
00:23:34,542 --> 00:23:36,875
I said that Captain Marvel...

283
00:23:37,042 --> 00:23:38,792
can absorb light energy.

284
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:40,083
I can see it.

285
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,417
And you, you can turn light...

286
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:44,083
into physical matter.

287
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,667
Which I have never heard of.

288
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:47,250
-But my working theory...
-I could totally show you.

289
00:23:47,417 --> 00:23:48,583
No!

290
00:23:50,792 --> 00:23:51,792
What the...

291
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:57,083
Hi.

292
00:23:58,042 --> 00:23:59,042
Hi.

293
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:02,208
Nah, they don't seem related.

294
00:24:03,417 --> 00:24:06,208
Whatever, Yusuf. Families are complicated.

295
00:24:06,917 --> 00:24:11,667
Monica, you wanna fill Carol in
on your working theory?

296
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:13,250
Yeah.

297
00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:15,292
Hi, Captain Marvel.

298
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,500
It is so good to see you,
Lieutenant Trouble.

299
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:20,750
You too.

300
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,500
And it's Captain Rambeau now.

301
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:25,708
Right. Sorry.

302
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:30,208
So, what's new?

303
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:31,667
-Where's my sister?
-Yeah.

304
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:36,083
I'm thinking that our joint exposure
to these unsteady jump points...

305
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:39,375
and our susceptibility to
electromagnetic energy...

306
00:24:39,542 --> 00:24:42,917
-has temporarily entangled our world-lines.
-Yeah, that, right there.

307
00:24:44,667 --> 00:24:47,458
Entanglement.
Our light powers are entangled.

308
00:24:47,625 --> 00:24:50,500
So, we switch places
whenever we use them at the same time.

309
00:24:50,667 --> 00:24:52,542
-Which would mean Kamala...
-When did you get powers?

310
00:24:53,167 --> 00:24:55,500
I walked through
a radiation shielding barrier...

311
00:24:55,667 --> 00:24:57,833
of a witch hex
and now I can manipulate and see...

312
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,917
all wavelengths
of the electromagnetic spectrum.

313
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:02,333
I'm very happy for you. Yeah.

314
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,958
-Where's our daughter?
-Yes, please. Where is Kamala?

315
00:25:05,125 --> 00:25:06,208
Wherever you were.

316
00:25:06,375 --> 00:25:07,583
-Where were you?
-Who's Kamala?

317
00:25:07,875 --> 00:25:09,792
The third person we're switching with.

318
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:13,375
-Light powers. Teenage girl. Where were you?
-What are you doing?

319
00:25:13,542 --> 00:25:15,542
-What are you doing?
-I'm trying to switch.

320
00:25:15,708 --> 00:25:17,292
-Why isn't it working when I need it to work?
-Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

321
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:18,333
-Danvers, Danvers!
-Hey!

322
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,333
-So confused.
-Tell Kamala that her Abu is very upset.

323
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,042
Where are we going
and why are we going there?

324
00:25:23,208 --> 00:25:25,875
-Carol!
-Carol, where you going?

325
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:37,875
-Oh, my God!
-Uh-oh!

326
00:25:38,042 --> 00:25:40,000
Monica, you gotta fly.

327
00:25:40,167 --> 00:25:41,375
No, no, no. I...

328
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:42,583
I mean, I know.

329
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,250
But technically, I haven't done that yet!

330
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:45,917
Yeah, well, you got to now...

331
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:48,167
or Kamala's not gonna graduate
from high school.

332
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:49,583
Come on! Use your core!

333
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:54,417
Oh, jeez.

334
00:25:54,583 --> 00:25:56,375
Hey. Black Girl Magic.

335
00:26:17,583 --> 00:26:19,333
I got you! I got you!

336
00:26:19,667 --> 00:26:20,667
I got you!

337
00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:23,125
Oops!

338
00:26:40,458 --> 00:26:43,625
Hold on!

339
00:26:43,792 --> 00:26:45,292
What is happening?

340
00:26:45,458 --> 00:26:47,375
I can't hold on to you while I'm flying.

341
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:52,042
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

342
00:26:52,208 --> 00:26:53,583
-We're gonna die!
-Hold on!

343
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,542
Hold on! I'm thinking, I'm thinking!

344
00:26:55,708 --> 00:26:57,792
Wait, I have an idea.

345
00:26:57,958 --> 00:26:59,083
Grab on to me!

346
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,333
This had better work!

347
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,333
Oh, it's cool. It's Carol.

348
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:16,083
Okay, no powers, no powers. Just...

349
00:27:28,417 --> 00:27:29,625
Who are they?

350
00:27:29,792 --> 00:27:33,375
They are associates of Captain Marvel.

351
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:37,667
The Annihilator is here?

352
00:27:37,833 --> 00:27:41,417
Yeah, well, she was.
And then these two just sort of appeared.

353
00:27:41,583 --> 00:27:42,708
What about the band?

354
00:27:42,875 --> 00:27:44,375
If she's meddling, I need to strike now.

355
00:27:44,542 --> 00:27:47,833
Yeah. I still can't account for the
instabilities exhibited on MB-418.

356
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,708
-This thing does much more than just...
-But it works?

357
00:27:52,292 --> 00:27:54,333
Yes. Yes. But if you give me more time...

358
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,167
-I can make it safer.
-No.

359
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:58,167
No. We do it now.

360
00:27:59,167 --> 00:28:01,458
Before the Annihilator appears.

361
00:28:19,375 --> 00:28:23,083
What should we do about... these two?

362
00:28:37,250 --> 00:28:38,667
You.

363
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,417
Hold that thought.

364
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,292
We gotta get that band off of her.

365
00:29:13,458 --> 00:29:15,083
It looks like mine.

366
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,375
Guys!

367
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:28,083
I can't fly.

368
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,625
Do you guys have
a spaceship I could borrow or...

369
00:29:31,792 --> 00:29:32,833
Kamala, don't talk to them.

370
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:34,917
You know my name!

371
00:29:44,958 --> 00:29:47,167
The Kree came here hopeful...

372
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:50,750
-that we could build a covenant of peace.
-What have you done?

373
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:54,583
But then you sic the Annihilator on us.

374
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:57,750
Like we're vermin.

375
00:29:59,417 --> 00:30:03,375
Once again,
the Skrull have betrayed the Kree.

376
00:30:04,417 --> 00:30:05,625
And for that...

377
00:30:31,708 --> 00:30:33,250
Carol, we gotta get these people out of here.

378
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:35,333
Emperor Dro'ge...

379
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,583
you need to evacuate your people now.

380
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:41,208
We have nowhere to go.

381
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,875
Carol, the ships...

382
00:31:09,542 --> 00:31:11,125
they're not gonna make it.

383
00:31:13,042 --> 00:31:14,958
Get back to the ship
and don't use your powers.

384
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:16,667
-But I can help.
-Now.

385
00:32:12,625 --> 00:32:14,500
-Let's go.
-Where's Kamala?

386
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:18,292
Kamala!

387
00:32:30,375 --> 00:32:31,375
No!

388
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:42,458
Let's go, let's go!

389
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,458
-Come on!
-Keep moving...

390
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:57,208
please, please.

391
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:02,500
-All these people, they're gonna...
-Come on, sweetie.

392
00:33:02,667 --> 00:33:04,292
-No! How can you just leave them here?
-Kamala, now!

393
00:33:04,458 --> 00:33:06,250
We need to save who we can.

394
00:33:46,417 --> 00:33:48,292
Transmission sent.

395
00:33:54,583 --> 00:33:55,583
Hey.

396
00:33:55,917 --> 00:33:57,167
This peace treaty...

397
00:33:58,208 --> 00:33:59,208
it was a good thing.

398
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,667
-It was a ruse.
-If it were...

399
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,417
your intervention failed.

400
00:34:06,083 --> 00:34:09,083
We don't need your help anymore.

401
00:34:12,667 --> 00:34:14,250
I called a friend.

402
00:34:14,417 --> 00:34:16,083
She can find a safe place for you.

403
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,208
Is that okay?

404
00:34:19,042 --> 00:34:20,625
We have no choice.

405
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:24,708
Incoming.

406
00:34:38,917 --> 00:34:40,333
Are you all right?

407
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,667
Thank you again.

408
00:34:47,167 --> 00:34:48,542
Always.

409
00:34:48,708 --> 00:34:50,917
I see that you've finally
found yourself a team.

410
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:52,083
It is unintentional.

411
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:54,458
Oh, I've been
on some unintentional teams myself.

412
00:34:54,958 --> 00:34:59,625
-I know, but...
-You can stand tall without standing alone.

413
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:02,542
Take it from me, Marv.

414
00:35:10,833 --> 00:35:11,833
Hey.

415
00:35:13,167 --> 00:35:14,792
Captain Marvel will fix this.

416
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,917
I promise.

417
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:32,958
Thank you.

418
00:35:35,917 --> 00:35:38,417
May our next meeting be joyful.

419
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:21,375
Breathe.

420
00:36:34,083 --> 00:36:35,500
Do you remember?

421
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:39,875
When the sun used to shine on Hala?

422
00:36:41,542 --> 00:36:43,667
How beautiful our home was?

423
00:36:46,708 --> 00:36:48,042
Before her?

424
00:36:54,208 --> 00:36:56,167
Before the Annihilator.

425
00:36:59,167 --> 00:37:00,333
I was there.

426
00:37:07,167 --> 00:37:08,792
I heard her lies...

427
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:11,792
claiming she was there to set us free.

428
00:37:13,375 --> 00:37:16,500
But when she destroyed
the Supreme Intelligence...

429
00:37:17,208 --> 00:37:19,167
she destroyed the Kree.

430
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:29,875
For 30 years I have been fighting
alongside you.

431
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:32,875
Not only have I brought you peace...

432
00:37:33,583 --> 00:37:36,958
but I have found a way
to return Hala to glory.

433
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:39,042
Supremor!

434
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:41,000
Supremor!

435
00:37:43,542 --> 00:37:47,208
We need more power than that band
can provide if we're to reignite our sun.

436
00:37:48,125 --> 00:37:49,458
That amount of energy...

437
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:50,958
Well, it would kill you.

438
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:53,458
If my life is the cost, so be it.

439
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:55,333
We will find the other in time, Suprem...

440
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,125
There is no more time.

441
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,833
Hala is out of time.

442
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:24,583
Need a hand?

443
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,250
Yeah.

444
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,458
Will you hand me that laser?
Three micrometres.

445
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:49,208
Wow.

446
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:52,375
So you can do that
because you walked through a witch hex?

447
00:38:52,542 --> 00:38:53,875
Yep.

448
00:38:54,042 --> 00:38:57,458
When I got blipped back,
they weren't sending us to space anymore.

449
00:38:57,625 --> 00:39:00,750
Grounded us to investigate
earthbound anomalies.

450
00:39:01,333 --> 00:39:02,625
That must have been hard.

451
00:39:02,792 --> 00:39:05,917
Your mom told me that you
always dreamed of going to space.

452
00:39:06,083 --> 00:39:07,333
That you had something to prove.

453
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,375
You said you'd be back before I knew it.

454
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,625
What?

455
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,375
When you left...

456
00:39:14,208 --> 00:39:17,125
you said you'd be back before I knew it.

457
00:39:19,583 --> 00:39:22,375
I meant what I said. I just,
I didn't know...

458
00:39:22,542 --> 00:39:25,208
what I was getting myself into.

459
00:39:25,375 --> 00:39:27,792
I didn't know how to explain
to a little girl that...

460
00:39:27,958 --> 00:39:32,000
A little girl that hung on your every word.

461
00:39:35,542 --> 00:39:37,208
If you knew...

462
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,417
I was going to come back.

463
00:39:40,583 --> 00:39:42,000
I just...

464
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:44,417
There was people that needed me.

465
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:47,000
We needed you, Carol.

466
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,250
Hey.

467
00:40:07,417 --> 00:40:09,583
I hope you don't mind.
I didn't have any other clothes.

468
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:11,417
It's totally fine.

469
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:12,917
Looks good on you.

470
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:16,792
I...

471
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:19,208
I'm really sorry...

472
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:20,417
for the way I spoke to you.

473
00:40:22,375 --> 00:40:23,375
Thank you.

474
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,917
I know that this situation isn't ideal...

475
00:40:28,292 --> 00:40:30,792
but it is actually nice...

476
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:33,458
having people on board again.

477
00:40:35,833 --> 00:40:37,542
It gets pretty lonely out here.

478
00:40:37,708 --> 00:40:41,250
Anytime you need company, I will be there.
I will drop everything. I will...

479
00:40:41,417 --> 00:40:42,833
I will drop high school.

480
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,375
Don't do that.

481
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:46,583
But can we start again?

482
00:40:48,167 --> 00:40:51,042
Hi, I'm Carol Danvers.

483
00:40:52,625 --> 00:40:53,625
I am Kamala Khan.

484
00:40:53,792 --> 00:40:55,958
But when I'm fighting crime
on the streets of Jersey City...

485
00:40:56,125 --> 00:40:58,792
I go by Ms. Marvel, and I hope
that's okay, like, copyright-wise.

486
00:40:58,958 --> 00:41:00,542
Because, honestly,
I never thought I'd ever get to meet you.

487
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:02,625
But now that it's happening and we're,
like, touching each other...

488
00:41:02,792 --> 00:41:04,667
I've realized I should have
asked permission.

489
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:09,125
So, twinsies.

490
00:41:10,208 --> 00:41:11,958
Okay. All right.

491
00:41:12,125 --> 00:41:14,042
Here's what we're gonna do.

492
00:41:14,333 --> 00:41:16,083
-Captain Marvel.
-You need to stop calling me that.

493
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,833
-I used to change your diapers.
-Oh, that was once.

494
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,750
And then I was told
you proceeded to vomit everywhere.

495
00:41:19,917 --> 00:41:20,917
First of all...

496
00:41:21,083 --> 00:41:22,708
it's my ship, so I make the game plan.

497
00:41:22,875 --> 00:41:24,750
Oh, I'm sorry.
When's the last time you led a team?

498
00:41:24,917 --> 00:41:26,333
As early as last week.

499
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,375
Goose doesn't count.

500
00:41:27,542 --> 00:41:28,792
Please. You try giving Goose orders.

501
00:41:28,958 --> 00:41:30,042
Oh, my God, we're a team?

502
00:41:30,208 --> 00:41:32,125
-We're not... We're not a team.
-No, no, no, we're not a team.

503
00:41:33,208 --> 00:41:35,667
I, Kamala Khan of Jersey City...

504
00:41:35,833 --> 00:41:39,000
am on a team with Captain Marvel
and Captain Monica Rambeau...

505
00:41:39,167 --> 00:41:41,667
who from this point onwards
will now be known as...

506
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:44,708
-Professor Marvel.
-Oh!

507
00:41:44,875 --> 00:41:47,167
-Professor Marvel.
-No.

508
00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:50,583
-No, no, she, she will not. But thank you.
-The Marvels.

509
00:41:50,917 --> 00:41:53,875
Now that we've got that out of the way,
team, I've been trying to tell you...

510
00:41:54,042 --> 00:41:55,917
I think I know how she's making
the weird jump points.

511
00:41:57,083 --> 00:41:58,083
She has one of these.

512
00:41:58,958 --> 00:42:00,458
It's my nani's bangle.

513
00:42:00,833 --> 00:42:03,000
It started glowing really weirdly...

514
00:42:03,167 --> 00:42:05,750
when Dar-Benn opened
that first jump point. Also...

515
00:42:05,917 --> 00:42:08,708
it once traveled me through space and time...

516
00:42:08,875 --> 00:42:10,583
so that's probably related.

517
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:13,375
What you're describing is a Quantum Band.

518
00:42:13,875 --> 00:42:15,125
I mean, I knew there were two of these.

519
00:42:15,292 --> 00:42:17,250
I just did not expect the other one
to be in space.

520
00:42:18,042 --> 00:42:20,542
They're a pair?
How do you have a Quantum Band?

521
00:42:20,708 --> 00:42:22,208
Okay. What is a Quantum Band?

522
00:42:22,375 --> 00:42:26,375
A myth. Or I thought it was a myth.
It's an ancient artifact.

523
00:42:27,792 --> 00:42:30,000
So this is what Dar-Benn found on
MB-418.

524
00:42:30,167 --> 00:42:32,875
And then her and Kamala just happened
to stumble into each other?

525
00:42:33,042 --> 00:42:34,625
I mean, what are the chances?

526
00:42:34,792 --> 00:42:37,000
"What you seek is seeking you."

527
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:39,083
It's inscribed on the bangle.

528
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,208
If the Kree legends are true...

529
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:45,125
the Quantum Bands were used
to create every jump point in the universe.

530
00:42:45,292 --> 00:42:46,417
Teleportation network.

531
00:42:46,875 --> 00:42:50,667
Two Quantum Bands working in unison
to connect the galaxy.

532
00:42:50,833 --> 00:42:54,208
So that would explain
our switch-y entanglement situation.

533
00:42:54,375 --> 00:42:57,250
Yeah, yeah, but Dar-Benn only has one.

534
00:42:57,417 --> 00:43:01,458
She must be overloading it with the
energy from her space hammer thingy.

535
00:43:01,625 --> 00:43:02,625
It's called the Universal Weapon.

536
00:43:02,792 --> 00:43:05,167
Oh, really? I was gonna call it Cosmi-Rod.

537
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:09,333
Either way, she's using it to force
unstable jump points into the grid.

538
00:43:09,875 --> 00:43:12,417
We have got to get to her
before she makes another one.

539
00:43:12,875 --> 00:43:15,125
She had star charts and maps
on the screens on her ship.

540
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:17,500
Okay. To where?

541
00:43:18,292 --> 00:43:20,375
-To the stars?
-Okay.

542
00:43:21,167 --> 00:43:22,958
It's fine. Got a plan.

543
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,042
We will use this.

544
00:43:25,333 --> 00:43:27,167
-Is that...?
-A Skrull torture device.

545
00:43:27,333 --> 00:43:29,542
And, wait, we put it on our heads?

546
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:33,375
Yes, it's fine.
You use it to access memories.

547
00:43:33,542 --> 00:43:35,292
I've been using it...

548
00:43:35,458 --> 00:43:37,833
to regain the memories
that the Kree took from me.

549
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:40,083
Still?

550
00:43:40,458 --> 00:43:41,458
Yeah.

551
00:43:41,625 --> 00:43:43,458
But, you know, it has a lot of other uses.

552
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:45,250
It's safe.

553
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,208
You might wanna get comfortable.

554
00:43:54,542 --> 00:43:56,208
This is weird.

555
00:43:57,333 --> 00:43:58,542
Wait. Go back.

556
00:44:00,458 --> 00:44:03,333
Her band absorbs your energy
and redirects it.

557
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:07,042
It's like you gave her power
to use against you.

558
00:44:08,583 --> 00:44:09,583
Kamala?

559
00:44:11,583 --> 00:44:12,542
What about this?

560
00:44:12,708 --> 00:44:15,458
There! Those coordinates.
Can you read that?

561
00:44:15,625 --> 00:44:17,292
Yes. The Magellanic Galaxy.

562
00:44:19,792 --> 00:44:21,583
All right, the pilot seat's all you.

563
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:24,875
Is that you, Monica? You're so cute!

564
00:44:26,292 --> 00:44:27,292
No, wait.

565
00:44:27,458 --> 00:44:28,542
Carol, what are you doing?

566
00:44:32,458 --> 00:44:33,750
Why'd you ask me to come, Maria?

567
00:44:33,917 --> 00:44:34,917
Mom.

568
00:44:36,917 --> 00:44:38,375
The cancer's back.

569
00:44:39,667 --> 00:44:41,750
So I need you to take care of Goose.

570
00:44:43,625 --> 00:44:44,917
-No.
-What do you mean "no?"

571
00:44:45,083 --> 00:44:46,792
No, I mean, you beat it once.
You'll beat it again.

572
00:44:46,958 --> 00:44:47,958
Carol...

573
00:44:48,125 --> 00:44:50,792
-I'm not taking the cat.
-It's not a cat.

574
00:44:52,875 --> 00:44:54,708
It should've been you that day.

575
00:44:55,583 --> 00:44:57,625
That stupid race to the hangar.

576
00:44:57,792 --> 00:44:59,958
I never wanted to be Captain Marvel.

577
00:45:00,625 --> 00:45:03,125
Captain Rambeau suits me just fine.

578
00:45:03,583 --> 00:45:06,208
And it's just until Monica gets back.

579
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:09,917
She blipped.

580
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:11,542
Carol, I don't wanna relive this.

581
00:45:11,708 --> 00:45:12,875
I'm sorry.

582
00:45:17,167 --> 00:45:18,958
Stop now, please, Carol!

583
00:45:19,125 --> 00:45:20,750
Remember why you're out there.

584
00:45:21,042 --> 00:45:23,667
-I'm looking for a patient in room 104.
-I don't know. I don't know what to tell you.

585
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,417
And remember to come home.

586
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:27,750
Your mom, she died, honey.

587
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:29,625
No. No, no, no!

588
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:35,750
Never do that again.

589
00:45:35,917 --> 00:45:37,708
I'm sorry. It wasn't on purpose.

590
00:45:37,875 --> 00:45:38,917
Wait, so your mom...

591
00:45:39,083 --> 00:45:41,583
Passed away while I was blipped.

592
00:45:42,458 --> 00:45:43,458
And when I came back...

593
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:45,375
no one was there.

594
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:53,167
Okay.

595
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Thank you.

596
00:46:05,167 --> 00:46:07,417
She seemed really cool. I'm sorry.

597
00:46:07,958 --> 00:46:09,292
She was.

598
00:46:09,667 --> 00:46:10,833
She was the best.

599
00:46:13,333 --> 00:46:16,292
Well, we have to make do
with what we know right now.

600
00:46:17,292 --> 00:46:19,250
Here is what we do know.

601
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,583
The Universal Neural Teleportation Network...

602
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:25,250
is a system of wormholes through
the space-time continuum aka, jump points...

603
00:46:25,417 --> 00:46:28,125
which allows us to hop
between different planetary systems.

604
00:46:28,292 --> 00:46:31,958
Basically, it stretches and reconfigures
space without rupturing the continuum.

605
00:46:32,542 --> 00:46:35,250
Like fracking, the more holes you drill...

606
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:38,917
the more destabilized the shale becomes
and then... earthquake.

607
00:46:41,125 --> 00:46:43,417
Bottom line, if she keeps creating
these jump points...

608
00:46:43,583 --> 00:46:45,208
it's gonna get really bad, really fast.

609
00:46:45,583 --> 00:46:47,958
Question is, what does she want?

610
00:46:48,917 --> 00:46:52,000
Tarnax used to be occupied by the Kree, so...

611
00:46:52,167 --> 00:46:53,625
maybe the attack was a warning?

612
00:46:53,792 --> 00:46:55,750
So, she could be after another former colony?

613
00:46:55,917 --> 00:46:57,542
Is there a former Kree colony
in the Magellanic?

614
00:46:57,708 --> 00:47:01,708
At one point the Kree colonized 25%
of the galaxy, so...

615
00:47:01,875 --> 00:47:03,792
If all she wanted was to destroy Tarnax...

616
00:47:03,958 --> 00:47:06,458
why not bring in an army
or use a bomb or something?

617
00:47:06,625 --> 00:47:07,667
Why a jump point?

618
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:10,833
You're right. Jump points aren't weapons,
they're means of transportation.

619
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,667
Every jump point has two sides...

620
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:15,083
so if Tarnax's atmosphere
was siphoned away...

621
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:17,917
-it had to go somewhere, or...
-Hala.

622
00:47:20,042 --> 00:47:21,583
The Kree Civil War...

623
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:23,708
basically bankrupted Hala
of its natural resources.

624
00:47:23,875 --> 00:47:25,125
The air is barely breathable...

625
00:47:25,292 --> 00:47:27,042
-they're suffering from a drought.
-A drought?

626
00:47:27,208 --> 00:47:29,250
So, she could be after water next.

627
00:47:29,417 --> 00:47:33,125
-Okay. Where in the Magellanic can we find...
-Aladna.

628
00:47:34,958 --> 00:47:37,250
Oceans cover 99.63% of the planet.

629
00:47:37,417 --> 00:47:40,125
That is a very specific stat.
You've been there.

630
00:47:42,458 --> 00:47:43,458
Yeah.

631
00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:45,208
Yeah.

632
00:47:48,083 --> 00:47:49,417
She said that really weird.

633
00:47:49,583 --> 00:47:50,542
-Yeah. Why are you being weird?
-Okay.

634
00:47:50,708 --> 00:47:52,375
Consensus on Aladna.

635
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:57,292
-Aye.
-Yeah, I say we do it.

636
00:47:57,458 --> 00:48:00,250
Get to Aladna
and separate Dar-Benn from that bangle.

637
00:48:00,417 --> 00:48:01,917
We have our heading.

638
00:48:02,083 --> 00:48:06,542
Kamala, you are not going
on any space adventures.

639
00:48:06,708 --> 00:48:09,375
Nicholas has told me
how dangerous they can be.

640
00:48:09,542 --> 00:48:11,833
It's just "Fury." God.

641
00:48:12,417 --> 00:48:13,667
Wait. Where are you guys? Where is Abu?

642
00:48:14,333 --> 00:48:17,750
Hell. This man has taken us to Hell.

643
00:48:19,792 --> 00:48:21,708
Hell? So that means I'm the devil?

644
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:24,500
-Really, Fury?
-They insisted,

645
00:48:24,667 --> 00:48:27,250
and your dad is not adjusting very well
to space travel.

646
00:48:27,417 --> 00:48:31,083
Hey, babe, so I'm in this crazy
space elevator and we're going up.

647
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:34,542
Or maybe we're going down.

648
00:48:34,708 --> 00:48:37,167
-Are there directions in space?
-Yes, there are.

649
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:38,500
But no filming.

650
00:48:38,667 --> 00:48:40,167
Oh. Okay.

651
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:42,333
Help me.

652
00:48:43,375 --> 00:48:44,375
Whoa.

653
00:48:52,042 --> 00:48:54,000
Fury, everything okay?

654
00:48:54,167 --> 00:48:55,292
We've had another surge.

655
00:48:55,458 --> 00:48:57,375
Reports are coming in across the network.

656
00:48:57,542 --> 00:48:59,167
It seems everyone's been affected.

657
00:48:59,333 --> 00:49:01,875
Well, we need to stop her
from making another one...

658
00:49:02,042 --> 00:49:04,583
and we can't risk intergalactic body swapping
in the meantime.

659
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,125
Mrs. Khan, I'm sorry, but your daughter
will have to stay aboard my ship...

660
00:49:08,292 --> 00:49:09,875
-until we can get to the bottom of this.
-Oh, no, no, no.

661
00:49:10,042 --> 00:49:10,875
Yes!

662
00:49:11,042 --> 00:49:12,292
You will let her go.

663
00:49:12,458 --> 00:49:15,625
Mrs. Khan, it is not that simple.

664
00:49:15,792 --> 00:49:17,500
We need Kamala.

665
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:19,667
Ammi, we found Nani's other bangle...

666
00:49:19,833 --> 00:49:21,583
and there's this weirdly beautiful
but kind of terrifying woman...

667
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:23,750
using the other one to hurt people.
And we have to stop her.

668
00:49:23,917 --> 00:49:25,208
You're telling me there's another bangle.

669
00:49:25,375 --> 00:49:27,917
And they're going to use that bangle
to hurt you?

670
00:49:28,083 --> 00:49:29,083
Monica will take care of her.

671
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:32,500
We will. And we will make sure
she gets back home in one piece.

672
00:49:32,667 --> 00:49:33,667
I promise.

673
00:49:34,042 --> 00:49:35,208
Stay the course.

674
00:49:35,375 --> 00:49:37,833
We'll figure out
how to close those jump points.

675
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,583
Kamala, you listen to me.

676
00:49:40,750 --> 00:49:42,083
If anything happens to you...

677
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:43,792
I will kill her.

678
00:49:43,958 --> 00:49:45,125
You tell her that.

679
00:49:46,792 --> 00:49:48,375
I love you, beta.

680
00:49:48,542 --> 00:49:49,625
I love you more.

681
00:49:49,792 --> 00:49:51,792
-Wait, what did she just say?
-Nothing.

682
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:55,583
Nobody cares more than Captain Marvel...

683
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:57,250
and nobody gets more grief for it.

684
00:49:57,417 --> 00:50:00,417
Trust me. Kamala is in good hands with Carol.

685
00:50:04,667 --> 00:50:06,125
What's wrong with that cat?

686
00:50:07,042 --> 00:50:08,500
It's acting very weird.

687
00:50:08,667 --> 00:50:11,583
Also, Mr. Fury, she's looking little pudgy.

688
00:50:11,958 --> 00:50:13,708
I think you're overfeeding her.

689
00:50:15,458 --> 00:50:16,458
Goose.

690
00:50:20,792 --> 00:50:21,792
Goose!

691
00:50:23,917 --> 00:50:25,083
Firefly? Night Light.

692
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:26,917
Countess Marvel. Mistress Marvel?

693
00:50:27,083 --> 00:50:28,167
-Doctor Marvel?
-That's too much.

694
00:50:28,625 --> 00:50:29,792
Doctor Bright.

695
00:50:30,667 --> 00:50:31,958
Professor Marvel.

696
00:50:32,125 --> 00:50:33,958
Nova, Supernova Girl...

697
00:50:34,125 --> 00:50:35,208
-Spectrum, Spectrum-Vision.
-You're doing too much.

698
00:50:35,375 --> 00:50:37,375
Vision! Oh, wait.
No. Sorry.

699
00:50:37,542 --> 00:50:39,500
How many times do I have to tell you guys
I do not want...

700
00:50:39,667 --> 00:50:41,500
-or need a code name?
-Why?

701
00:50:41,667 --> 00:50:44,250
Besides, none of it matters
if we're not coordinated out there.

702
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:45,500
Wanna figure out the switching thing?

703
00:50:48,083 --> 00:50:50,625
Powers stay activated after a switch.
Good to know.

704
00:50:50,792 --> 00:50:52,792
Okay, everyone together on three.

705
00:50:52,958 --> 00:50:56,042
Ready? One, two, three, go.

706
00:50:56,208 --> 00:50:58,125
Now, why would you say "go"
if we're going on three?

707
00:50:58,292 --> 00:50:59,375
I'm aware.

708
00:51:05,875 --> 00:51:06,875
Now.

709
00:51:07,458 --> 00:51:08,458
Now.

710
00:51:08,875 --> 00:51:09,708
Now.

711
00:51:10,125 --> 00:51:11,125
One, two, three!

712
00:51:13,833 --> 00:51:14,792
She gave me eyes.

713
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:20,000
Now. Now.

714
00:51:20,167 --> 00:51:21,750
Can you hold on for one second?

715
00:51:22,167 --> 00:51:23,792
Walk. And switch!

716
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:26,833
Switch!

717
00:51:30,875 --> 00:51:31,792
Hey, I got this!

718
00:51:39,292 --> 00:51:40,292
Yes!

719
00:51:43,375 --> 00:51:44,375
And switch!

720
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:49,625
That's why you wanna invest in index funds
rather than in individual stocks.

721
00:51:49,792 --> 00:51:54,125
Of course, both a Roth IRA and 401k
are important for tax purposes.

722
00:51:54,292 --> 00:51:56,500
You know, I never even thought
about planning for retirement.

723
00:51:56,667 --> 00:51:58,125
Hey, it's never too late.

724
00:51:58,292 --> 00:52:00,500
And it's never too early, like I say.

725
00:52:00,667 --> 00:52:02,458
-How old are you?
-306.

726
00:52:03,208 --> 00:52:04,208
Wow. Same age.

727
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:09,417
What was that?

728
00:52:09,583 --> 00:52:11,208
-I'm gonna find out.
-Please.

729
00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:13,500
Foreign object in sector K.

730
00:52:13,667 --> 00:52:15,750
-Sweet Svartalfheim.
-Don't touch it.

731
00:52:18,042 --> 00:52:19,042
What is it?

732
00:52:19,208 --> 00:52:20,875
I haven't the foggiest idea.

733
00:52:21,042 --> 00:52:23,042
-How did it get in there?
-I don't know.

734
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:26,292
Should we tell Fury?

735
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,417
Twenty seconds to the jump point.

736
00:52:30,583 --> 00:52:32,000
Do you guys realize
how crazy this is right now?

737
00:52:32,167 --> 00:52:34,208
Like, I'm in a spaceship
with two superheroes.

738
00:52:34,375 --> 00:52:35,583
Also, is it too late to go
to the bathroom?

739
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:37,250
Because I feel like
it's gonna hit really soon.

740
00:52:37,417 --> 00:52:38,417
No one would believe me. Like my...

741
00:52:38,583 --> 00:52:39,833
Nakia, she would never...

742
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:38,625
Okay. Here we go. Comms.

743
00:53:38,792 --> 00:53:40,000
Wow!

744
00:53:40,167 --> 00:53:42,500
-I've always wanted one of these.
-Thank you.

745
00:53:42,667 --> 00:53:45,375
-Testing. Testing, one, two, three.
-Kamala. Kamala.

746
00:53:45,542 --> 00:53:47,708
We hear you, baby. Thank you.

747
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:51,792
So, real quick before we get sucked in...

748
00:53:51,958 --> 00:53:53,000
What the hell is that?

749
00:53:53,583 --> 00:53:56,958
I should warn you that
I'm kind of famous here.

750
00:53:57,333 --> 00:53:59,792
Well, you do know
you're famous everywhere, right?

751
00:53:59,958 --> 00:54:03,667
This one's kinda different.
I helped the prince with a legal issue.

752
00:54:03,833 --> 00:54:04,708
Okay.

753
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:05,958
Mm-hmm. Let's go.

754
00:54:06,125 --> 00:54:07,083
No matter what...

755
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:08,333
follow my lead.

756
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,333
Aladnean culture is very specific.

757
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,292
So, there's gonna be a bit of a
ceremony we have to do...

758
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:14,625
but just... stay cool.

759
00:54:14,792 --> 00:54:16,917
Fair Aladna...

760
00:54:17,083 --> 00:54:20,000
it's a peaceful crossroads

761
00:54:20,167 --> 00:54:22,583
Diamond of the quadrant...

762
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:25,625
Aladna, our home

763
00:54:25,833 --> 00:54:27,125
Hi, small child, could you tell...

764
00:54:27,208 --> 00:54:29,417
Fair Aladna...

765
00:54:30,042 --> 00:54:32,958
as if no time has passed

766
00:54:33,125 --> 00:54:35,958
So excited that you're home

767
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:40,625
Our princess is home

768
00:54:40,792 --> 00:54:41,667
Princess?

769
00:54:47,333 --> 00:54:48,250
It's a technicality.

770
00:54:48,875 --> 00:54:49,875
Carol. What is happening?

771
00:54:50,167 --> 00:54:51,167
Their language is Song.

772
00:54:51,333 --> 00:54:53,167
Most of them won't understand you
unless you sing. Come on.

773
00:54:54,083 --> 00:54:57,333
Going to the banquet
Prince Yan's at the banquet

774
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:59,000
Going to the banquet
Prince Yan's at the banquet

775
00:54:59,167 --> 00:55:01,208
Hi. Oh, hi, hello.

776
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,125
Going to the banquet
Going to the banquet

777
00:55:04,708 --> 00:55:07,625
Where's the prince? Where's the prince?
Hey, hey, hey

778
00:55:07,792 --> 00:55:10,833
Going, going, going, going
Going to the banquet

779
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:14,250
Going, going, going, going
Going to the banquet

780
00:55:17,167 --> 00:55:18,333
Why aren't you guys dancing?

781
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:19,542
I am dancing.

782
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:21,750
Dancing is life

783
00:55:21,917 --> 00:55:23,417
Oh, we're almost there.

784
00:55:25,333 --> 00:55:28,417
How angelic.
Hi... Okay. All right.

785
00:55:29,083 --> 00:55:30,083
Wow.

786
00:55:33,125 --> 00:55:35,333
Oh, my gosh,
give me some of what they're having.

787
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:38,250
-If you tell anyone about...
-What?

788
00:55:38,417 --> 00:55:40,417
That you're a pretty, pretty princess?

789
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:44,667
So, that's what you meant
when you said "legal issue."

790
00:55:44,833 --> 00:55:47,875
It is a marriage of convenience.
It's more of a diplomatic act, you know?

791
00:55:48,042 --> 00:55:50,333
It's like, there was a power struggle.
Matriarchal society.

792
00:55:50,875 --> 00:55:53,792
We are friends. It's a long story.

793
00:55:54,167 --> 00:55:55,625
Maybe you could sing it.

794
00:55:56,208 --> 00:55:57,667
Maybe not.

795
00:55:58,125 --> 00:55:58,958
We're here.

796
00:56:05,167 --> 00:56:06,708
Damn.

797
00:56:06,875 --> 00:56:08,917
-You saw them arrive
-Oh, hello

798
00:56:09,917 --> 00:56:12,375
Well, okay, I see why you like
to come here.

799
00:56:15,583 --> 00:56:20,708
-Attention
-Yes

800
00:56:20,917 --> 00:56:25,917
A pleasure to announce
To this lovely roomful

801
00:56:26,208 --> 00:56:28,417
Two new faces

802
00:56:30,625 --> 00:56:33,542
One could be more cheerful

803
00:56:33,708 --> 00:56:35,958
Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha

804
00:56:36,125 --> 00:56:39,167
But nonetheless, we ring the bells

805
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:43,417
To usher in, who, pray tell?

806
00:56:43,917 --> 00:56:44,917
None other than

807
00:56:45,333 --> 00:56:48,667
One, two, three

808
00:56:49,417 --> 00:56:54,833
The Marvels!

809
00:56:54,917 --> 00:56:56,000
The Marvels

810
00:56:56,083 --> 00:56:56,917
The Marvels?

811
00:56:57,083 --> 00:56:57,958
Yes!

812
00:56:58,458 --> 00:56:59,958
How is that even a thing already?

813
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:02,875
-Okay, let's be cool.
-Where's the prince?

814
00:57:15,083 --> 00:57:16,083
That's...

815
00:57:17,125 --> 00:57:18,125
What the hell?

816
00:57:23,458 --> 00:57:25,833
-What is she doing?
-She's respecting the flow.

817
00:57:33,208 --> 00:57:36,042
How long

818
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:39,292
do I have with my dance partner this time?

819
00:57:39,458 --> 00:57:41,417
Yan...
we are all in danger

820
00:57:41,625 --> 00:57:42,917
What is happening?

821
00:57:43,083 --> 00:57:43,917
What?

822
00:57:44,083 --> 00:57:46,625
-The Captain needs our help
-Help!

823
00:57:46,792 --> 00:57:48,208
Dar-Benn is coming

824
00:57:48,292 --> 00:57:49,750
I'm feeling so many feelings right now.

825
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:52,500
Oh, Aladna's not afraid of her

826
00:57:52,667 --> 00:57:55,542
Invite her down
put her feet on the ground

827
00:57:55,708 --> 00:57:56,958
Give me a chance here...

828
00:57:57,125 --> 00:58:01,542
-before it gets too messy
-So lead the wolf inside our walls

829
00:58:01,708 --> 00:58:03,625
And trust that you alone...

830
00:58:03,792 --> 00:58:06,292
-can stop an army?
-Have I ever let you down?

831
00:58:06,458 --> 00:58:08,375
How many chapters of your Captain Marvel
fan fiction is this giving you?

832
00:58:08,458 --> 00:58:09,917
I'm not about to start...

833
00:58:10,042 --> 00:58:10,875
So many.

834
00:58:10,958 --> 00:58:11,875
and don't forget...

835
00:58:12,042 --> 00:58:13,792
Don't forget

836
00:58:15,417 --> 00:58:18,625
I'm not alone

837
00:58:22,167 --> 00:58:23,208
Monica.

838
00:58:27,292 --> 00:58:32,000
My Princess from the star...

839
00:58:32,167 --> 00:58:35,083
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Stop. Please stop.
We need to talk.

840
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:36,542
-Okay, let's talk.
-Okay.

841
00:58:36,708 --> 00:58:38,583
Oh, wait. He doesn't have to sing?

842
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:39,750
Yeah, he's bilingual.

843
00:58:40,292 --> 00:58:41,625
We are severely underdressed.

844
00:58:41,792 --> 00:58:44,625
But could you get us
something a little more battle-ready?

845
00:58:44,792 --> 00:58:46,042
Of course.

846
00:58:46,458 --> 00:58:47,458
Thank you.

847
00:58:51,375 --> 00:58:52,750
Theories so far?

848
00:58:52,917 --> 00:58:54,833
At best, a one-off pest problem.

849
00:58:56,125 --> 00:58:58,625
At worst, an enemy plant.

850
00:58:58,792 --> 00:59:00,958
Some kinda infestation bioweapon.

851
00:59:01,125 --> 00:59:03,458
Or it could be from a traitor from within.

852
00:59:03,625 --> 00:59:08,250
Well, let's not go there yet.
This... egg you say...

853
00:59:08,417 --> 00:59:11,833
let's just continue to study it,
and if anything...

854
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,250
Warning. Twenty-nine new objects detected.

855
00:59:18,625 --> 00:59:19,625
Oh, my God.

856
00:59:22,583 --> 00:59:24,542
What about Lady of Light?

857
00:59:25,125 --> 00:59:26,792
-Frequency. Pulsar.
-No. No.

858
00:59:26,958 --> 00:59:28,208
Pulsar Light Lady.

859
00:59:28,375 --> 00:59:30,667
Absolutely not. These...
These are too much, right?

860
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:31,667
-Definitely.
-No.

861
00:59:42,083 --> 00:59:44,083
We make this quick. Nothing grandiose.

862
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:46,792
You three need to disappear. But stay close.

863
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:47,958
My specialty.

864
00:59:55,125 --> 00:59:56,125
This will work, Yan.

865
00:59:58,375 --> 01:00:00,958
Remember, we wanna keep
unintentional switching to a minimum.

866
01:00:01,125 --> 01:00:03,792
Entertain her as long as you possibly can.

867
01:00:03,958 --> 01:00:05,542
Monica and I will get the jump on her.

868
01:00:05,708 --> 01:00:06,625
And we'll get the bangle.

869
01:00:10,333 --> 01:00:11,458
It's time.

870
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,042
Supremor, why have you come?

871
01:01:16,208 --> 01:01:20,792
I've come here to pardon you
for your crimes against the Kree Empire.

872
01:01:21,625 --> 01:01:22,625
Kneel.

873
01:01:23,042 --> 01:01:24,042
To you?

874
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:28,500
-I will never kneel.
-Okay.

875
01:01:56,917 --> 01:01:57,917
Damn it!

876
01:02:21,542 --> 01:02:22,542
Use your scarf.

877
01:02:40,875 --> 01:02:41,875
Go!

878
01:02:50,958 --> 01:02:52,125
I found her.

879
01:03:08,833 --> 01:03:09,833
Monica, where are you?

880
01:03:16,792 --> 01:03:17,750
Monica, tag me in.

881
01:03:17,917 --> 01:03:19,333
One, two...

882
01:03:20,375 --> 01:03:21,292
Don't do this.

883
01:03:21,542 --> 01:03:22,750
You're too late.

884
01:04:01,792 --> 01:04:03,083
Where did you get that?

885
01:04:03,667 --> 01:04:06,125
My grandma, she sent it to me in the mail.

886
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:09,792
-Give it to me.
-Kamala, run.

887
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:11,500
Get to the ship.

888
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:28,375
With this, your powers
only make me stronger.

889
01:04:52,333 --> 01:04:53,750
The surges are frying our systems.

890
01:04:53,917 --> 01:04:55,042
Are we doing something about these?

891
01:04:55,208 --> 01:04:56,333
The space elevator's offline.

892
01:04:56,500 --> 01:04:57,792
You ever come in here with good news?

893
01:04:59,292 --> 01:05:00,958
Half the evacuation pods just went down.

894
01:05:01,125 --> 01:05:03,125
That's not good news.

895
01:05:36,875 --> 01:05:37,917
Are you guys in?

896
01:05:38,083 --> 01:05:39,083
In.

897
01:05:40,875 --> 01:05:42,542
Redirect all fighters.

898
01:05:53,917 --> 01:05:55,292
Disengaging autopilot.

899
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:04,000
Oh, my God.
Okay, here we go. Here we go.

900
01:06:07,667 --> 01:06:08,583
Monica?

901
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:12,375
Monica, we're going down, Monica!

902
01:06:16,042 --> 01:06:17,333
I thought you could drive this thing!

903
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:18,625
Carol! Get down here.

904
01:06:19,042 --> 01:06:20,042
Hold that thought.

905
01:06:20,208 --> 01:06:21,208
Can you believe this woman?

906
01:06:27,833 --> 01:06:29,917
O, Captain! My Captain!

907
01:06:38,583 --> 01:06:40,875
-No, no, no!
-Move over.

908
01:06:50,083 --> 01:06:51,625
I'm activating a jump point.

909
01:06:51,792 --> 01:06:54,125
-No, I can lose her.
-And what about the other 20 ships?

910
01:06:54,292 --> 01:06:55,292
I can do this.

911
01:07:01,292 --> 01:07:02,708
-Missile lock.
-Guys?

912
01:07:02,875 --> 01:07:04,208
Missile lock.

913
01:07:14,083 --> 01:07:15,667
Incoming missiles.

914
01:07:15,833 --> 01:07:17,417
-Impact in five...
-We need to leave now.

915
01:07:17,583 --> 01:07:18,625
-I can't let this happen again.
-four...

916
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:19,583
-It already has.
-three, two...

917
01:07:19,708 --> 01:07:22,000
-I can do this.
-And you'll kill us trying.

918
01:07:22,167 --> 01:07:24,333
Jump point activated.

919
01:07:43,833 --> 01:07:45,708
We left Aladna to fend for themselves.

920
01:07:45,875 --> 01:07:47,250
Dar-Benn was gonna get my bangle.

921
01:07:47,417 --> 01:07:49,625
So I made a tough call
like you did on Tarnax.

922
01:07:49,792 --> 01:07:52,667
Don't try to be like me.
I messed this whole thing up.

923
01:07:52,833 --> 01:07:54,042
If we weren't entangled...

924
01:07:54,208 --> 01:07:55,875
if we weren't here,
then you could have beat Dar-Benn.

925
01:07:56,042 --> 01:07:57,083
And I'm sorry.

926
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:01,708
No, you don't understand.

927
01:08:01,875 --> 01:08:05,292
The Kree had been ruled by an AI
for a millennia...

928
01:08:05,458 --> 01:08:06,875
that led them into a war.

929
01:08:07,042 --> 01:08:10,292
And I thought the only way to stop it
was to destroy it.

930
01:08:11,333 --> 01:08:12,375
But I just...

931
01:08:13,250 --> 01:08:14,583
made it worse.

932
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:18,625
I'm the reason why the civil war
started in the first place...

933
01:08:18,792 --> 01:08:21,625
I'm the reason why they
couldn't breathe the air.

934
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:24,207
That's how I got the name Annihilator.

935
01:08:25,957 --> 01:08:28,917
And I never wanted you to see
that version of me.

936
01:08:32,542 --> 01:08:34,375
Is that why you never came back?

937
01:08:34,875 --> 01:08:36,542
I thought if I fixed it...

938
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,457
then I could come home.

939
01:08:39,542 --> 01:08:40,625
Carol.

940
01:08:42,625 --> 01:08:44,625
That's not how family works.

941
01:08:46,292 --> 01:08:50,000
I never expected you to be
the mighty Captain Marvel.

942
01:08:51,875 --> 01:08:53,292
I just wanted you.

943
01:08:54,957 --> 01:08:56,542
My aunt.

944
01:09:02,207 --> 01:09:03,957
I'm really glad that you're here now.

945
01:09:10,917 --> 01:09:12,542
And you, too.

946
01:09:13,332 --> 01:09:14,792
I'm glad to be here.

947
01:09:15,957 --> 01:09:19,457
I hope that goes without saying.
And I am sorry...

948
01:09:19,625 --> 01:09:21,875
for coming on too strong at the beginning.

949
01:09:22,042 --> 01:09:23,875
I did not give you a lot of space
to be a real person.

950
01:09:29,292 --> 01:09:30,457
We have to find her.

951
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:32,167
I mean, but she could be anywhere.

952
01:09:32,332 --> 01:09:35,000
No, not anywhere.

953
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,832
She's targeting the people
that I care about...

954
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,582
and stealing resources
from every place I call home.

955
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:43,457
We have to warn Fury.

956
01:09:49,832 --> 01:09:51,457
This is an emergency.

957
01:09:51,625 --> 01:09:56,458
All S.A.B.E.R. personnel must report
to an evacuation pod immediately. Walk.

958
01:09:56,625 --> 01:09:58,625
-Do not run.
-We only have one evacuation bay online.

959
01:09:58,792 --> 01:09:59,875
Which means that all we have left...

960
01:10:00,042 --> 01:10:02,417
to evacuate 350 personnel
are 15 escape pods...

961
01:10:02,583 --> 01:10:04,750
which seat five, 10, if we squeeze.
It's nowhere near enough.

962
01:10:04,917 --> 01:10:07,375
Well, fill the remaining ones
with as many people as you can...

963
01:10:07,542 --> 01:10:11,000
-then come up with a Plan B.
-This is an emergency. All S.A.B.E.R...

964
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:22,333
No, no, no.

965
01:10:23,125 --> 01:10:24,042
Aamir. Go help them.

966
01:10:24,208 --> 01:10:25,042
Okay, okay. Okay.

967
01:10:27,625 --> 01:10:28,750
I got this.

968
01:10:33,833 --> 01:10:34,833
My living room.

969
01:10:35,833 --> 01:10:36,833
Goose?

970
01:10:48,333 --> 01:10:50,708
Goose, how'd you...

971
01:10:51,458 --> 01:10:54,125
Come here. Come. Come on.

972
01:10:54,292 --> 01:10:57,125
Yes. Yes. Come here. Look at you.

973
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:00,125
Look!

974
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:01,417
Oh, no, not my good eye!

975
01:11:03,625 --> 01:11:05,333
We only have one escape pod left.

976
01:11:05,917 --> 01:11:06,917
We're doomed.

977
01:11:08,375 --> 01:11:09,667
In the end...

978
01:11:10,042 --> 01:11:12,833
none of us choose how we transition
from this life...

979
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:14,417
to the next.

980
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:16,458
What? No!

981
01:11:16,625 --> 01:11:18,583
Get everyone to the evacuation deck.

982
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:19,750
Now!

983
01:11:26,417 --> 01:11:28,042
Here, kitty. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

984
01:11:28,125 --> 01:11:30,000
What are we doing?

985
01:11:30,958 --> 01:11:32,083
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

986
01:11:32,167 --> 01:11:33,708
Let's go. Come on. Come on.

987
01:11:34,208 --> 01:11:36,292
-I can't. Can you?
-I got it.

988
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:41,000
What is going on, fam?

989
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:42,500
Kamala?

990
01:11:43,083 --> 01:11:44,708
Kamala! Yusuf, Kamala!

991
01:11:44,875 --> 01:11:47,500
Kamala! Kamala!

992
01:11:49,208 --> 01:11:50,542
You're back safely, beta.

993
01:11:50,708 --> 01:11:51,875
You're not dead.

994
01:11:52,125 --> 01:11:53,875
I've lost contact with Earth.

995
01:11:54,042 --> 01:11:56,208
We're officially at abandon-ship phase.

996
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:01,750
Spit him out.

997
01:12:01,917 --> 01:12:03,250
-Spit him out.
-No, no, no.

998
01:12:03,417 --> 01:12:04,833
No. That's the plan.

999
01:12:06,125 --> 01:12:07,417
-That's the plan?
-It's much easier...

1000
01:12:07,583 --> 01:12:11,042
to transport a family of cats
than hundreds of crew members.

1001
01:12:11,667 --> 01:12:12,958
So, we're literally herding cats?

1002
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:18,708
Come here, kitty.

1003
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,708
Attention, S.A.B.E.R. crew.

1004
01:12:21,875 --> 01:12:24,792
Stop running and let the Flerkens eat you.

1005
01:12:24,958 --> 01:12:26,375
You will be fine.

1006
01:12:37,208 --> 01:12:38,583
S.A.B.E.R. crew.

1007
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:41,833
Stop running and let the Flerkens eat you.

1008
01:12:42,875 --> 01:12:44,292
Stop running.

1009
01:12:58,833 --> 01:13:00,083
I'm sorry.

1010
01:13:05,208 --> 01:13:07,958
Stop running and let the Flerkens eat you.

1011
01:13:09,292 --> 01:13:10,375
Stop running.

1012
01:13:31,042 --> 01:13:32,375
Guys, I found her.

1013
01:13:33,875 --> 01:13:36,000
-Come on. Come on, move.
-Hey! Come on.

1014
01:13:36,167 --> 01:13:37,167
Come on, come here.

1015
01:13:38,958 --> 01:13:41,083
-Go, go, go.
-Come on, come on.

1016
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:43,417
-Go to the spacecraft bay.
-Okay. Come on.

1017
01:13:43,583 --> 01:13:45,583
Come on.
Yusuf, stop with your belt.

1018
01:13:59,833 --> 01:14:02,583
Nope. No. No, no, no. Thank you. No.

1019
01:14:03,583 --> 01:14:04,833
Come, come, come.

1020
01:14:12,708 --> 01:14:16,250
Don't you worry, little one.
Here, go to Kamala. Go to Kamala.

1021
01:14:19,375 --> 01:14:21,542
-There you go, come, come.
-I found Dar-Benn.

1022
01:14:21,708 --> 01:14:22,667
What?

1023
01:14:23,583 --> 01:14:24,833
She wants our sun.

1024
01:14:52,542 --> 01:14:53,667
You leavin' again?

1025
01:14:54,333 --> 01:14:55,417
Yeah.

1026
01:14:55,958 --> 01:14:57,500
Ammi, the universe isn't safe.

1027
01:14:57,667 --> 01:14:59,667
And if the universe isn't safe,
that means you guys aren't safe.

1028
01:14:59,833 --> 01:15:01,000
And if you guys aren't...

1029
01:15:01,625 --> 01:15:02,958
Listen to me.

1030
01:15:03,667 --> 01:15:07,333
You are chosen for a greater purpose, okay?

1031
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:09,375
So, of course you must go now.

1032
01:15:10,667 --> 01:15:13,417
But I will never let you go.

1033
01:15:13,875 --> 01:15:15,667
You understand that, right?

1034
01:15:20,292 --> 01:15:22,125
-Yeah.
-Come back safely, beta.

1035
01:15:22,292 --> 01:15:25,083
You better.
I don't wanna be an only child.

1036
01:15:25,250 --> 01:15:27,458
Not again. Not with these two.

1037
01:15:30,917 --> 01:15:33,667
You think it's wise taking that bangle
to the bad guy?

1038
01:15:34,042 --> 01:15:36,375
Yes. Mr. Fury's right. Give it to me.
I will take it home.

1039
01:15:37,292 --> 01:15:38,500
Dar-Benn's opened another jump point...

1040
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:40,708
and we're gonna need both bangles
to close it.

1041
01:15:40,875 --> 01:15:43,833
Then I guess you'd better make damn sure
she doesn't get her hands on it.

1042
01:15:44,833 --> 01:15:45,958
Understood.

1043
01:16:04,375 --> 01:16:05,500
Oh, God, Mr. Fury...

1044
01:16:05,667 --> 01:16:08,792
-you are going in the wrong direction!
-Mrs. Khan, I know!

1045
01:16:12,208 --> 01:16:14,958
-You did it, Mr. Fury!
-I didn't do anything.

1046
01:16:18,667 --> 01:16:19,792
Are you praying?

1047
01:16:20,750 --> 01:16:23,208
Don't stop! We need all the help we can get!

1048
01:16:24,208 --> 01:16:25,125
Amen!

1049
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:27,500
Amen!

1050
01:16:27,667 --> 01:16:28,833
Holy cow!

1051
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,167
Mr. Fury!

1052
01:17:23,792 --> 01:17:24,917
There she is...

1053
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,625
the Annihilator herself.

1054
01:17:27,792 --> 01:17:29,250
It's over, Dar-Benn.

1055
01:17:29,625 --> 01:17:30,792
No, not yet.

1056
01:17:30,958 --> 01:17:33,500
I know that you would do anything
to protect Hala.

1057
01:17:34,167 --> 01:17:37,500
This will be the end of the Kree.
It will be the end of everything.

1058
01:17:37,667 --> 01:17:40,833
You took from me.
I'm simply repaying the favor.

1059
01:17:41,833 --> 01:17:44,708
Now, give me the band.

1060
01:17:46,125 --> 01:17:47,250
You're forgetting something.

1061
01:17:47,417 --> 01:17:49,250
-What?
-Me.

1062
01:18:03,625 --> 01:18:06,958
This could have been so much easier.

1063
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:09,875
I don't know. I like our odds.

1064
01:19:30,500 --> 01:19:32,708
You're living up to your name again.

1065
01:19:33,917 --> 01:19:35,292
I didn't want this.

1066
01:19:35,458 --> 01:19:37,208
Death seems to follow you.

1067
01:19:44,375 --> 01:19:46,042
It doesn't have to end like this, Dar-Benn.

1068
01:19:46,208 --> 01:19:47,375
Please, just give us the bangle.

1069
01:19:47,542 --> 01:19:48,458
I won't!

1070
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:52,833
Hala's sun died because of you.

1071
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,583
Why shouldn't you repay us?

1072
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:57,792
Maybe she should.

1073
01:19:59,667 --> 01:20:02,292
The reaction in your sun's core has slowed.

1074
01:20:02,458 --> 01:20:04,750
It needs an incredible amount of energy
to jump-start it...

1075
01:20:04,917 --> 01:20:06,625
and that's what you have, Carol.

1076
01:20:07,625 --> 01:20:10,542
You can use your powers to save Hala.

1077
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,958
But I've never done anything
like that before.

1078
01:20:14,125 --> 01:20:17,125
In the last couple of days I have done
a lot of things I have never done before.

1079
01:20:18,833 --> 01:20:20,042
You got this.

1080
01:20:25,750 --> 01:20:26,917
For Hala.

1081
01:20:31,708 --> 01:20:33,083
For Hala.

1082
01:20:50,625 --> 01:20:52,958
Try anything
and I'll kill her faster than you can move.

1083
01:20:57,375 --> 01:20:58,917
Carol!

1084
01:21:02,958 --> 01:21:03,958
No!

1085
01:21:19,125 --> 01:21:20,417
You won't survive this.

1086
01:21:20,583 --> 01:21:23,042
Dar-Benn, listen to me.

1087
01:22:07,125 --> 01:22:08,250
Are you okay?

1088
01:22:09,583 --> 01:22:10,583
Yeah.

1089
01:22:12,042 --> 01:22:13,500
I didn't switch.

1090
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,000
One, two, three.

1091
01:22:40,708 --> 01:22:42,667
I'm so glad you're okay.

1092
01:22:43,583 --> 01:22:44,750
You got the bangles.

1093
01:22:47,125 --> 01:22:48,458
We are gonna need those.

1094
01:22:51,458 --> 01:22:53,667
Okay, come on, Princess.

1095
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:01,083
So, what are we looking at?

1096
01:23:01,250 --> 01:23:04,042
A self-propagating singularity
with negative mass...

1097
01:23:04,208 --> 01:23:05,750
and non-Newtonian topology.

1098
01:23:07,625 --> 01:23:10,667
She tore a hole in space-time.

1099
01:23:13,208 --> 01:23:16,625
That is a different reality
bleeding into ours.

1100
01:23:17,083 --> 01:23:18,250
Can we even fix that?

1101
01:23:18,417 --> 01:23:21,708
In theory, you and Carol can reproduce
the same amount of energy...

1102
01:23:21,875 --> 01:23:23,292
that was used to open it.

1103
01:23:23,458 --> 01:23:26,250
I will absorb it and then release it,
but from inside the tear.

1104
01:23:26,417 --> 01:23:27,958
But what about the switching?

1105
01:23:28,125 --> 01:23:30,625
Our powers aren't entangled anymore.

1106
01:23:34,083 --> 01:23:36,500
Well, that's a good thing, I guess.

1107
01:23:36,958 --> 01:23:40,958
But, wait. You want us to blast you
with the same amount of power...

1108
01:23:41,125 --> 01:23:43,625
that punched a hole in the fabric
of space-time?

1109
01:23:44,583 --> 01:23:47,333
If we wanna un-punch it, yeah.

1110
01:23:48,083 --> 01:23:49,083
Monica...

1111
01:23:50,750 --> 01:23:51,958
You're gonna need this.

1112
01:24:00,417 --> 01:24:01,667
How are you feeling, Ms. Marvel?

1113
01:24:03,167 --> 01:24:05,750
These bangles traveled
through space and time.

1114
01:24:05,917 --> 01:24:07,167
To find me.

1115
01:24:09,375 --> 01:24:10,625
I was born for this.

1116
01:24:14,833 --> 01:24:16,417
It has to be now.

1117
01:24:58,708 --> 01:25:00,125
Your mom would be proud.

1118
01:25:01,167 --> 01:25:02,792
Higher, further, faster.

1119
01:25:05,042 --> 01:25:07,042
Higher, further, faster.

1120
01:26:04,625 --> 01:26:06,625
It's closing, Monica.
You've got to get out of there.

1121
01:26:08,167 --> 01:26:09,458
I can't leave, Carol.

1122
01:26:09,625 --> 01:26:10,917
What? What do you mean?

1123
01:26:11,083 --> 01:26:12,167
I can't leave.

1124
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:13,542
I have to finish the job.

1125
01:26:13,708 --> 01:26:15,583
No! Monica, it's closing.
You'll be trapped!

1126
01:26:16,208 --> 01:26:17,208
It's okay.

1127
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,125
Come on.

1128
01:26:40,042 --> 01:26:42,042
Always knew I would have to stay.

1129
01:27:49,958 --> 01:27:51,292
Kamala.

1130
01:27:57,375 --> 01:27:59,500
Kamala, you saved
the world.

1131
01:28:04,417 --> 01:28:07,458
Why are you crying?
Why are you crying?

1132
01:28:11,958 --> 01:28:13,250
What happened?

1133
01:28:14,458 --> 01:28:16,250
We lost Monica.

1134
01:28:19,250 --> 01:28:21,500
She got stuck on the other side.

1135
01:28:22,250 --> 01:28:23,417
And Carol?

1136
01:28:26,958 --> 01:28:28,708
She went to fulfill a promise.

1137
01:29:53,375 --> 01:29:54,583
How are things?

1138
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,875
The planets are expected
to make a full recovery.

1139
01:29:58,042 --> 01:30:00,750
And a team of scientists are being sent
to Hala to try and help their people.

1140
01:30:00,917 --> 01:30:02,458
That's not what I meant.

1141
01:30:25,833 --> 01:30:29,083
This says "Kitchen," but there are
all these hot sauce packets...

1142
01:30:29,250 --> 01:30:32,375
And then there's
this very bizarre-looking tray...

1143
01:30:32,542 --> 01:30:35,458
which I will say is
a very good quality, though.

1144
01:30:35,625 --> 01:30:36,625
You can keep it.

1145
01:30:36,792 --> 01:30:38,000
-Oh, no, no, Carol, I just...
-Where else would they go?

1146
01:30:39,500 --> 01:30:40,500
Oh, yeah, yeah, it was for me.

1147
01:30:40,667 --> 01:30:44,750
The vastness of it just gives you
a whole new perspective on life.

1148
01:30:44,917 --> 01:30:46,833
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

1149
01:30:47,000 --> 01:30:48,375
And it was surprisingly cool.

1150
01:30:52,625 --> 01:30:54,167
This place is amazing.

1151
01:30:54,333 --> 01:30:55,917
Yeah, it is.

1152
01:30:57,542 --> 01:30:58,792
Hey, do you still fly that thing?

1153
01:30:59,625 --> 01:31:00,792
-You wanna check it out?
-I do.

1154
01:31:00,958 --> 01:31:01,917
All right.

1155
01:31:02,083 --> 01:31:05,292
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
Come here. Come here. Come here.

1156
01:31:06,167 --> 01:31:09,625
-I'm so happy that you're home safe, beta.
-Okay.

1157
01:31:15,500 --> 01:31:16,500
Aamir...

1158
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:20,292
this would be a lovely house
to raise a family in, you know?

1159
01:31:21,958 --> 01:31:22,958
Aamir.

1160
01:31:23,250 --> 01:31:24,875
This is so cool.

1161
01:31:25,375 --> 01:31:26,792
Pilot seat's all you.

1162
01:31:36,375 --> 01:31:37,708
Let's fly this thing.

1163
01:31:38,208 --> 01:31:40,167
I actually don't have the key.

1164
01:31:40,333 --> 01:31:42,333
I'm just looking after it.

1165
01:31:44,083 --> 01:31:46,000
Just until Monica gets back?

1166
01:31:46,625 --> 01:31:47,792
Yeah.

1167
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:51,250
Just until Monica gets back.

1168
01:31:51,917 --> 01:31:53,333
I really miss her.

1169
01:31:53,958 --> 01:31:56,042
We were good together.

1170
01:31:56,208 --> 01:31:58,542
Which got me thinking...

1171
01:32:10,208 --> 01:32:12,000
Pizza delivery.

1172
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:17,833
Okay.

1173
01:32:23,917 --> 01:32:25,458
Can I help you?

1174
01:32:25,625 --> 01:32:27,000
Kate Bishop.

1175
01:32:30,333 --> 01:32:32,375
Did you think you're
the only kid superhero in the world?

1176
01:32:34,167 --> 01:32:35,625
-Well, I'm 23.
-Oh, I know.

1177
01:32:36,792 --> 01:32:37,917
I've been reading up on you.

1178
01:32:39,042 --> 01:32:40,042
Where did you get that?

1179
01:32:40,208 --> 01:32:41,583
I found it in my couch.

1180
01:32:41,958 --> 01:32:42,875
Okay.

1181
01:32:43,042 --> 01:32:45,125
You've just become
part of a much larger universe.

1182
01:32:46,583 --> 01:32:50,292
Which, at the moment, is just me, mostly.

1183
01:32:50,458 --> 01:32:51,458
I do have feelers out, though.

1184
01:32:51,625 --> 01:32:53,458
-Did you know Ant-Man had a daughter?
-What do you want?

1185
01:32:53,625 --> 01:32:55,250
I'm putting together a team.

1186
01:32:55,917 --> 01:32:57,250
And I want you on it.

1187
01:33:03,208 --> 01:33:04,208
Please?

1188
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:12,167
Mom?

1189
01:36:15,417 --> 01:36:16,750
"Mom"?

1190
01:36:18,417 --> 01:36:20,250
-Mom!
-"Mom?"

1191
01:36:20,417 --> 01:36:22,375
I've missed you so much!

1192
01:36:22,542 --> 01:36:23,583
You missed me?

1193
01:36:23,750 --> 01:36:26,292
-I'm so sorry. I'm... I'm...
-Okay. Okay. Okay, okay.

1194
01:36:26,458 --> 01:36:29,792
Hey, hey, look at me.
It's okay. You're okay. Hey.

1195
01:36:30,917 --> 01:36:33,042
How's our mysterious visitor?

1196
01:36:33,208 --> 01:36:35,375
She seems a little disoriented.

1197
01:36:35,542 --> 01:36:38,208
Where... Where are we? What happened?

1198
01:36:38,375 --> 01:36:40,458
We were hoping you could tell us.

1199
01:36:41,375 --> 01:36:43,708
All we know is that Binary found you.

1200
01:36:43,875 --> 01:36:48,125
My theory? You somehow crossed
through a tear in space-time.

1201
01:36:48,292 --> 01:36:51,000
You are now in a reality parallel
to your own.

1202
01:36:51,750 --> 01:36:54,625
Which is, of course, impossible.

1203
01:36:57,167 --> 01:36:59,625
I think there might be
a little confusion happening.

1204
01:36:59,792 --> 01:37:02,958
Confusion is but the first step
on the journey to knowledge.

1205
01:37:03,125 --> 01:37:05,750
Okay. I'll take it from here.

1206
01:37:05,917 --> 01:37:08,083
Charles asked for an update.

1207
01:37:09,542 --> 01:37:11,250
I'll come by and check on you later.

1208
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:23,792
Who are you?

1209
01:37:25,167 --> 01:37:27,125
Oh, shit.
