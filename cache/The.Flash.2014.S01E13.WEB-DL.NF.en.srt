of Ronnie's body, not the other way around?

126
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:24,069
Simple Darwinism, I suspect.

A brand new organism will select the
strongest parts of itself in order to survive.

Survival of the fittest.

In this case, Ronnie's body, Stein's mind.

130

But any event, he badly hurt an innocent man
and we have hunted meta-humans for less.

Quentin Quale...

...the scientist that Ronnie attacked
is a former colleague of Martin Stein.

136

If Martin is indeed in control
of Ronnie's body...

137
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,187
...he may be trying to figure out
what's happening to him.

138
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:03,358

I don't even know what Stein looks like.

Most scientists don't have an appreciation
for the value of aesthetics.

Albert Einstein said,
"Once you can accept the universe...

...as being something expanding into
an infinite nothing which is something..."

150
00:08:50,655 --> 00:08:53,283
"Wearing stripes with plaid
comes easy."

actual books anymore.

-Oh.

153
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:04,252
Physics. Hobby or endeavor?

00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,463
Both, actually.

CLARISSA:
Of course I've heard of S.T.A.R Labs.

178
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:27,585
Martin was always vocal
about the competition.

179
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:30,630

the C.C.P.D. looking...

Martin was very proud of that one.

184
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,227
Well, I always hoped to win
one of these myself.

185

Oh, and look at that,

Takes a special kind of person
to make Dr. Wells jealous.

187
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:55,113
Martin had a talent
for making people jealous.

188
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,781
Even me.

189
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,326
I sometimes think Martin loved his theorems
and experiments...

190
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:01,995
...more than he did me.

191
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,914
I'm sure that's not true.

192

since he disappeared?

No.

194
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:16,301
Mrs. Stein, could I show you a photograph?

195
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,595
Have you seen this person before?

196
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:21,389
Yes, I have.

197

Who is he?

198
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,436
Um...

199
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,897
He's a person of interest
in your husband's case.

200
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:31,858
When did you see him?

201
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:35,987
I started getting the feeling
that someone was watching me.

202
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,323
Sometimes I still do.

203
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:42,035
And about a month
after Martin disappeared...

204
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:46,039
...that young man showed up here.

212

-This isn't my body.

Where's my body?

215
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:40,718
I see my life but I can't reach it.

216
00:12:40,927 --> 00:12:45,098
Please send someone.
There's an intruder in my house.

217
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,521
It appears Martin Stein and Ronnie Raymond
have something in common...

218
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,022
...besides sharing a body.

219
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,900
They both feel the need to protect
the women they love.

220
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:59,612
Clarissa said she feels like
she's being watched.

221
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,239
Well, then...

222
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,408
...this has all the makings of a stakeout.

223

-I'll cancel.
-No. No, go.

225
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:12,041
If we need you here, something tells me
you can get back in a hurry.

226
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:19,257
I'm not picking up anything.
Not even with the super light.

227
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:20,550
Super light?

228
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,428
It's a multispectrum ultraviolet laser
enhanced scanner...

229
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:26,514
...that detects molecular schisms
in the 600-megavolt range...

230
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:28,933
...but I figured "super light"
was easier to say.

231
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,393
But what does it tell you?

232
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,770
Nothing we didn't already know
about that night.

233
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,105
Okay, keep looking.

Ahem. Uh, can I get you boys
something to drink?

235

It was often used to back vintage mirrors.

If there were two speedsters there
that night...

252
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,213
...the sparks from their movement
would've generated enough flashes...

253
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,882
...to actually expose images
onto the silver nitrate.

254

No. That would be so lame.

264

Ha, ha. All right, so here's the plan:

265
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:25,174
First, a dinner reservation at Paper Clip.

266
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:26,592
Then a round of mini golf.

267

Followed by Mal Duncan,
who's playing at an underground jazz club.

so he hooked us up.

"A scientist's work is never finished."

His work is never finished. My work did this
to Ronnie, did this to Martin Stein.

But it's not finished, and it won't be...

And this may be one of them.

473
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:47,434
Dr. Wells is a great man.

474
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:52,147
I was nothing when he gave me a job,
a chance to change my life.

475
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:55,025
He has helped so many people.
He's not a murderer.

476
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:56,318
Cisco.

477
00:28:57,027 --> 00:29:00,364
I'm a cop. I'm good at reading people.

478
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:04,284
So I know I can trust you with my suspicion.

479
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:08,080
When I go talk to the family and friends
of a murder suspect...

480
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,958
...somebody I know is guilty...

481
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,669
...and I tell them the person they love
is a killer...

482
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,879
...guess what they all say.

483
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,883
"That's not the person I know."

484
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:25,013
I think I'm done being a cop for today.

485
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,190
Are you comfortable?

486
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:36,984
A little warm.

487
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,653
Ronnie used to always run warm.

488
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:42,906
Not that warm.

489
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,910
Can I talk to him?

490
00:29:48,412 --> 00:29:51,581
Sorry, my dear,
I'm not sure it works like that.

491
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,584
I can feel him, though.

492
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,004
I have these memories.

493
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:00,340
Memories that I know aren't my own.

494
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:03,051
One is particularly strong.

495
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,971
Piedmont State Park,
it's famous for the Hudson Falls.

496
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:12,853
I know that I've never been,
but I can remember those waterfalls perfectly.

497
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,399
That's where Ronnie proposed to me.

498
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,444
He loves you very much.

499
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:22,446
That, I can feel.

500
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:28,035
WELLS:
<i>Dr. Snow, can we see you for a minute?</i>

501
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,870
Excuse me.

502
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:37,461
-You okay?
-Yeah, it's just confusing.

503
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,380
What isn't confusing
is what's happening to him now.

504
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:45,385
Ronnie's body is rejecting Stein's atoms
like a host rejecting a parasite.

505
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:49,264
The resulting instability
is causing an exothermic reaction.

506
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:52,601
I worry, if his temperature
continues to rise...

507
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:54,603
...it'll set off a chain reaction.

508
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,938
And then what happens?

509
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,318
He could go nuclear.

510
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:09,701
Ronnie.

511
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:11,912
Not Ronnie.

512
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,956
-Martin Stein.
-Cisco Ramon.

513
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:18,627
Your colleagues are in the next room,
not so subtly discussing my condition.

514
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,467
That's not freaky at all.

515
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:30,097
It seems Ronnie's fight with the Flash
has exacerbated the Firestorm matrix.

516
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,932
It's unstable.

517
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:35,852
It's exponentially increasing the rate
of fission inside his body.

518
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:38,271
How long does he have?

519
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,691
If his temperature keeps rising
at the current pace...

520
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,027
...no more than a couple of hours.

521
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:47,906
But you can fix it, right? I mean,
you can separate them before it's too late?

522
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:52,119
Any attempt we make to separate
the two of them could be catastrophic.

523
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,371
A nuclear explosion.

524
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:59,042
And a nuclear explosion of this magnitude
would level this entire city.

525
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:01,002
Unless...

526
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,046
Unless what?

527
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,258
Unless the host body
were no longer functional.

528
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:09,428
You wanna kill Ronnie?

529
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,930
No, I don't wanna kill Ronnie.

530
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:15,016
But in this scenario,
Ronnie is the host body.

531
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:18,311
If you kill Ronnie, you kill Stein.
That's two people.

532
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,939
I don't know how else to stop it.

533
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:24,526
And my guess is
that if Ronnie and Professor Stein...

534
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:27,070
...knew the consequences that
we were all facing...

535
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:28,989
...they would make the same decision.

536
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:32,451
It's two lives for millions.

537
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:37,330
Can you give us a minute?

538
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:47,048
-Caitlin...
CAITLIN: I've already lost Ronnie once.

539
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:49,968
I'm not gonna do it again.

540
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:53,430
You said we have a couple of hours.

541
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,557
Use them.

542
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:05,484
Dr. Wells, you don't really
think we should kill Ronnie, do you?

543
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,652
Stay here, Cisco.

544
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,121
BARRY:
Hey.

545
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,499
Sorry.

546
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,376
Can I get you anything, or...?

547
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:28,548
A glass of Chateau Haut-Brion
Pessac-Leognan 1982 might be nice.

548
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:31,259
Or maybe it wouldn't.

549
00:33:31,468 --> 00:33:35,639
This body's taste buds
would obviously be different from my own.

550
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,183
Perhaps I'm now a light beer man.

551
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,769
There are worse things to be.

552
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:43,355
You mean like a living nuclear bomb?

553
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,274
You know.

554
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:51,363
Unstable nuclear fission was always a danger
in the transmutation process.

555
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:54,032
Plus, you all argue very loudly.

556
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:57,869
I'm sorry.

557
00:33:58,078 --> 00:34:01,373
But my friends are gonna figure out
how to fix this, I promise.

558
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,501
I remember meeting you, Mr. Allen,
on the train.

559
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:10,173
You were headed to S.T.A.R. Labs
with a girl, but not your girlfriend.

560
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:12,551
Yeah.

561
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:16,179
I'm not sure that I have any girlfriend.

562
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:21,059
You know, Einstein was not only brilliant...

563
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,728
...he had a great sense of humor.

564
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:25,730
How did it go?

565
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:29,234
"Any man who drives safely
while kissing a pretty girl...

566
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:34,322
...is not giving the pretty girl
the attention she deserves."

567
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,535
If I learned anything this past year...

568
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:40,829
...life's too short not to live.

569
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:51,339
-Hey.
-What are you doing here?

570
00:34:51,548 --> 00:34:53,633
-I gave you an out.
-I don't want an out.

571
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:55,885
I won't date someone who's
into someone else.

572
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,263
I'm not into anyone else.
I'll prove it to you.

573
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:01,349
This is a <i>naga jolokia,</i>
or the ghost pepper.

574
00:35:01,558 --> 00:35:06,605
It is the world's hottest pepper, measuring
401.5 times hotter than Tabasco sauce.

575
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,190
If you do not agree
to go on another date with me...

576
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:12,736
...I will eat it, right here, right now.

577
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,114
You're bluffing.

578
00:35:16,865 --> 00:35:18,617
I never bluff.

579
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:25,874
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine, yeah.

580
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:27,667
-Are you sure?
-Mm-hm.

581
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,795
Yes, yes, I'll go out with you.

582
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:34,633
-That pepper could've killed you, nerd.
-Thanks. Mm.

583
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,761
Ugh. Thank you.

584
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:41,931
Okay, I won't let my job...

585
00:35:42,724 --> 00:35:47,479
...or how bad my mouth is burning right now
come between us.

586
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:51,691
My Spice Champion of Central City. Ha, ha.

587
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:09,834
GIDEON:
<i>A crude weapon, if I may say so, Dr. Wells.</i>

588
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:12,337
I couldn't agree more, Gideon.

589
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,674
But it will do the job.

590
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:24,516
Gideon...

591
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:30,021
...can the tachyon prototype be converted
into a quantum splicer?

592
00:36:30,271 --> 00:36:33,358
<i>Theoretically,
but I must warn you, Dr. Wells...</i>

593
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:36,653
<i>...converting the tachyon prototype
will delay your timetable.</i>

594
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:41,282
There's not gonna be a timetable if Central
City goes up in a mushroom cloud.

595
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:44,035
Hey, anything?

596
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:49,165
I have an idea. It's a bit of a Hail Mary,
but Cisco and I are gonna give it a try.

597
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,293
-Thank you.
-I'll get Professor Stein.

598
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:53,962
Looking for the professor?

599
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,631
Yeah, he's gone.

600
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:02,345
-You guys almost done?
-Hang on, hang on.

601
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:04,347
CAITLIN:
I found Stein. He's in the Badlands.

602
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:07,392
The middle of nowhere,
30 miles outside of Central City.

603
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,352
Minimum safe distance.

604
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,187
He's sacrificing himself.

605
00:37:11,396 --> 00:37:13,565
How much time does he have left?

606
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,442
Twelve minutes.

607
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:19,738
And we're done.

608
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:24,659
-What is it?
-This is a quantum splicer.

609
00:37:24,868 --> 00:37:27,912
-Will it work to separate them?
-We'll know in 12 minutes.

610
00:37:28,121 --> 00:37:30,498
Now, Barry, even you
can't outrun a nuclear blast...

611
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:35,378
...so you get this device to Professor Stein
and you get out of there as fast as you can.

612
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:37,297
-What are you doing?
-Going with you.

613
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:39,174
-No, you're not.
-It's too dangerous.

614
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,509
Barry doesn't know how
to operate the splicer.

615
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:45,722
-Cisco's gonna talk me through it.
-There's not enough time. Let's go.

616
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:47,515
Go.

617
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:55,482
What was that?

618
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:02,113
Uh, comm system's on the fritz.
I'll be right back.

619
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:07,911
-Cisco.
-I'm not proud of it but I ran the samples.

620
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:11,581
-One wasn't identified. The other had a match.
<i>-Cisco, you're hesitating.</i>

621
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:13,583
-Was it Wells?
-No, it's not Dr. Wells.

622
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:16,002
I told you, he has nothing to do with this.

623
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,129
But I know whose blood it is.

624
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:19,380
It's Barry's.

625
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:21,633
We already know
Barry was there that night.

626
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:23,885
No, no, no, you don't understand.

627
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:28,598
The sample had high levels of P-16, a protein
that builds up in the blood as we get older.

628
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:31,351
<i>And these levels were way too high
for an 11-year-old.</i>

629
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:36,648
This sample was from Barry as an adult.

630
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:53,331
Professor Stein!

631
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:56,709
What are you doing here? You can't be here!

632
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,545
Get her out of here now!

633
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,756
Please, look,
Ronnie's still in there somewhere.

634
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:05,426
All those people.
Clarissa, I won't let them die.

635
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,345
It's better I end this now.

636
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:09,138
We can separate you!

637
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:11,391
We can stop the explosion.

638
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,894
-How?
-A quantum splicer.

639
00:39:15,103 --> 00:39:18,022
It's a fission device
designed to bombard your atoms...

640
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:21,985
...with as much energy as they experienced
in the particle accelerator explosion.

641
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,987
It should be enough to separate you.

642
00:39:24,571 --> 00:39:28,324
Please, professor,
you have nothing left to lose.

643
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:36,666
Ronnie, if you're in there...

644
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:38,626
...I love you.

645
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,680
That was from him.

646
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:55,393
I look forward to meeting you
in person, professor.

647
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:07,989
It's not working.

648
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:12,535
-He's not gonna make it. He's gonna blow.
-Get out of there. Barry, get out of there now.

649
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:15,204
-Oh, no. No, no!
-Caitlin, we have to go.

650
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:16,414
Run!

651
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,086
No!

652
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,522
Sir, we have a thermonuclear detonation...

653
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:44,150
...approximately 30 miles northeast
of Central City.

654
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:47,153
Deploy the Rapid Response Team, sergeant.

655
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:49,530
Bring me Firestorm.
