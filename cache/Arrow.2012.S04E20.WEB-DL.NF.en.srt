Now is not the time for panic.

00:00:03,836 --> 00:00:05,838
We let him rot in prison.

3
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:09,942
Clearly, you overestimate
Darhk's capacity for forgiveness.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,544
Which is to say that he has any.

5
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:16,049
Should Damien prove to be unreasonable,
I have implemented contingencies.

00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,757
What happened to Ian and Judy?

00:00:24,824 --> 00:00:27,294
They come down with that nasty little flu
that's been going around?

11
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,230
Some were wary of this meeting,
given that...

12
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:31,998
You all abandoned me to my imprisonment?

13
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:34,067
I visited.

14
00:00:34,134 --> 00:00:36,136
Someone should teach
this evil organization

15
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:38,138
a lesson in helping their fellow man.

16
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:40,607
I'm sure it's all
just a simple misunderstanding.

17
00:00:40,673 --> 00:00:43,976
After all, why would I rely solely
on the word of Malcolm Merlyn?

18
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:46,779
-He can be so underhanded.
-Cute.

19
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,350
And our illustrious council has worked
together for such a very long time.

20

I'm glad that we still have your trust.

21
00:00:52,419 --> 00:00:56,656
Of course. I had a lot of time to reflect
while I was in prison.

22
00:00:57,490 --> 00:00:59,592
Mostly about religion and Bundt cake.

23
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:01,961
But after much thought, I realized that...

24
00:01:02,028 --> 00:01:04,197
Oh, almost forgot.

25
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:07,100
Did my little incarceration
delay Genesis at all?

26
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,169
(GRUNTS) Of course not.

27

without your help,

it is time to begin

Milo Armitage. SCPD found him
in an alley outside Ellendale.

43
00:02:08,195 --> 00:02:09,729
And across town...

44
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:11,931
-(KEYBOARD KEYS CLACKING)
-Phaedra Nixon.

45
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,434
-Okay, so, what am I missing?
-They were both HIVE.

46
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:16,736
You probably don't recognize
Phaedra and Milo now that they're dead,

47
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,705
or maybe you were too busy
running for your life, but...

48
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:20,307
They were with Darhk
when he held us hostage.

49
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:21,374
And now they're dead.

50
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:24,577
Wait, so you think
crazypants Lonnie Machin's back in town?

51
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,313
No, his grudge is against Darhk, not HIVE.

52
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,480
You think Darhk is cleaning the house?

53
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,849
Well, HIVE didn't lift a finger
to break him out of Iron Heights.

54
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,251
That was all Andy and Merlyn.

55
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:34,354
Okay, well, if Darhk is settling scores,
then now might be the time to hit him.

56
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:37,824
We have seen how powerful he is.
I can't risk losing anyone else.

57
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,226
We just can't sit on our hands, Oliver.

58
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:41,794
We're not just sitting on our hands,
but before we do anything,

59
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:43,830
we need to know
that we can counteract his magic.

60
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,665
Well, is that even possible?

61
00:02:45,998 --> 00:02:47,099
I think it might be.

62
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:49,636
I was finally able
to get in touch with Constantine

63
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:52,339
and he put me onto someone
who he thinks may be able

64
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:54,741
to teach me how to defend
against Darhk's magic.

65
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:57,944
Okay. Well, I'm not just saying this
because I love <i>Harry Potter,</i>

66
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,647
but why are we not all taking
those lessons?

67
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:04,317
Well, it is easier said than done,
and apparently quite dangerous.

68
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:08,921
So, I have to go to Hub City
for a day or two.

Okay, in that case,
can I take the weekend with Alex?

Kind of wants to go away, clear our heads.

I think that...

Actually, I think
everyone should take a little time.

Lay low, but stay available,

319
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:48,747
(SIGHS) Darhk has a similar idol.

320

It gives him his power.

Mmm-mmm. It only channels it.

322
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:56,022
Darhk's power comes from...

All things have their opposite.

Darhk draws his power from fear and death.

331
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:20,946
Its opposite is light and hope.
<i>La luz del alma.</i>

332
00:16:21,413 --> 00:16:22,848
Light of the soul.

333
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,919
If you can channel <i>la luz del alma,</i>

334
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,357
you will be able to repel Darhk's magic.

If the darkness inside you
outweighs the light,

338
00:16:43,702 --> 00:16:48,807
instead of repelling Darhk's magic,
you'll end up fueling it.

629
00:34:52,323 --> 00:34:55,793
Felicity's taking her and Sara back.
Darhk is...

630
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:57,428
Darhk's in the wind.

631
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:02,533
John, what happened?

632
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:07,138
He was never gonna back off, Oliver.

633
00:35:10,941 --> 00:35:13,111
My family,

634
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:15,913
they were never gonna be safe.

635
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:27,492
FELICITY: Hey.

636
00:35:27,558 --> 00:35:28,693
Hi.

637
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:32,930
-Did you get in touch with Thea?
-Not yet.

638
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:36,634
-You okay?
-(SIGHS)

639
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,172
Earlier, with Darhk, it worked.

640
00:35:42,207 --> 00:35:45,176
He tried to use his magic on me
and I was able to repel it.

641
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:46,477
That's incredible.

642
00:35:48,078 --> 00:35:49,514
How'd you do it?

643
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:53,384
(SIGHING)

644
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:56,287
I heard your voice in my head.

645
00:35:58,088 --> 00:35:59,790
You were reminding me
of all of the good things

646
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:01,226
that I have in my life.

647
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,363
I heard Thea, I heard John.

648
00:36:08,132 --> 00:36:09,334
I heard Laurel.

649
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:15,039
Just telling me to keep fighting,
to never give up.

650
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:19,143
Just telling me to have hope.

651
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:28,219
(KISSES)

652
00:36:30,488 --> 00:36:31,556
Hey.

653
00:36:33,023 --> 00:36:35,493
-Sara? Where's Sara?
-No, no, no, she's fine.

654
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:38,896
She's fine. Felicity took her to Donna's.
She's okay.

655
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:40,265
(SIGHS)

656
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:46,237
But something's wrong.

657
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:56,214
I, um...

658
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:59,584
I had to put him down, Lyla.

659
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,621
Andy.

660
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,859
I had to kill my baby brother.

661
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:12,663
He wasn't a brother to you, Johnny.

662
00:37:14,265 --> 00:37:16,100
Not in the ways that really matter.

663
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:20,204
What happened?

664
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:28,913
He reached for my gun. (SIGHS)

665
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,951
I didn't have a choice.

666
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:46,964
Oh, no.

667
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:48,633
-No, no, no, no.
-What? What?

668
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:50,801
(BREATHES HEAVILY)

669
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:56,307
It's gone. Darhk took it.

670
00:37:57,675 --> 00:37:58,843
Took what?

671
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:03,448
Rubicon.

672
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:06,584
I thought Rubicon
was being stored at A.R.G.U.S.

673
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:10,087
It was,
until Shadowspire tried to steal it.

674
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:11,622
After Waller's death,

675
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:14,224
-I had it moved for security reasons.
-To where?

676
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:17,695
It was under your skin?

677
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:20,998
A sub-dermal implant. Darhk ripped it out.

678
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:24,034
Lyla, you need to tell us what Rubicon is.

679
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:27,872
A ballistic launch override protocol.

680
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:30,240
Designed to prevent any country,
even our own,

681
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,676
from firing a nuclear missile.

682
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:34,845
Something tells me
Darhk's plans aren't so benign.

683
00:38:39,249 --> 00:38:43,854
LYLA: <i>With some work and the right
expertise, Rubicon could be corrupted.</i>

684
00:38:44,589 --> 00:38:47,157
Instead of controlling nukes
to prevent them from being launched...

685
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:48,225
Oh, my God.

686
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,260
Darhk would control
the world's nuclear stockpile.

687
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:51,496
To what end?

688
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:54,064
I don't mean to apply logic
to a bad guy's plot here,

689
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:57,668
but Darhk destroys the world, then what?
He'll be ruler of nothing.

690
00:38:57,735 --> 00:38:59,036
Unless he wants to rebuild.

691
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:03,140
-Andy told me that Genesis was coming.
-I don't think so.

692
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:04,609
Phil Collins said they'd never tour again.

693
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:07,445
The Old Testament, the Book of Genesis.

694
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:10,681
God wanted to give the world a do-over
so he destroyed it.

695
00:39:10,748 --> 00:39:12,149
He destroyed it with a flood.

696
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,619
Rubicon is Darhk's flood.

697
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,394
FELICITY:
<i>So, nuclear annihilation is Darhk's flood.</i>

698
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:26,296
What's he planning on building as his ark?
