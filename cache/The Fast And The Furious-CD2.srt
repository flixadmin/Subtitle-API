1
00:00:05,193 --> 00:00:06,820
I wanna show you something.

2
00:00:17,138 --> 00:00:18,571
Wow.

3
00:00:21,209 --> 00:00:22,733
Me and my dad built her.

4
00:00:23,745 --> 00:00:29,240
900 horses of Detroit muscle.
It's a beast.

5
00:00:29,317 --> 00:00:32,115
- Know what she ran in Palmdale?
- No. What did she run?

6
00:00:32,187 --> 00:00:34,018
Nine seconds flat.

7
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,688
- God.
- My dad was driving.

8
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:42,196
So much torque the chassis twisted
coming off the line.

9
00:00:43,298 --> 00:00:45,823
Barely kept her on the track.

10
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,869
- So what's your best time?
- I've never driven her.

11
00:00:48,937 --> 00:00:50,029
Why not?

12
00:00:52,841 --> 00:00:55,071
Scares the shit out of me.

13
00:00:57,212 --> 00:01:02,980
That's my dad. He was coming up
in the pro stock car circuit.

14
00:01:03,051 --> 00:01:04,712
Last race of the season.

15
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:10,856
A guy named Kenny Linder came up
from inside in the final turn...

16
00:01:10,925 --> 00:01:14,224
and clipped his bumper and put him
into the wall at 120.

17
00:01:17,565 --> 00:01:20,398
I watched my dad burn to death.

18
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,961
I remembered hearing him scream.

19
00:01:27,775 --> 00:01:32,405
The people that were there said
he had died before the tanks blew.

20
00:01:38,686 --> 00:01:41,621
They said it was me
who was screaming.

21
00:01:44,559 --> 00:01:47,187
I saw Linder about a week later.

22
00:01:48,263 --> 00:01:52,063
I had a wrench, and I hit him.

23
00:01:52,133 --> 00:01:53,896
And I didn't intend
to keep hitting him...

24
00:01:53,968 --> 00:01:57,267
but by the time I was done,
I couldn't lift my arms.

25
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,644
He's a janitor at a high school.

26
00:02:05,713 --> 00:02:08,307
Has to take the bus
to work every day.

27
00:02:09,384 --> 00:02:12,785
And they banned me
from the tracks for life.

28
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:20,250
I live my life
a quarter-mile at a time.

29
00:02:22,096 --> 00:02:24,826
Nothing else matters...
not the mortgage, not the store...

30
00:02:24,899 --> 00:02:27,993
not my team and all that bullshit.

31
00:02:29,203 --> 00:02:31,728
For those ten seconds or less...

32
00:02:33,207 --> 00:02:34,640
I'm free.

33
00:02:55,196 --> 00:02:58,597
So how is it, anyways,
that the gang came to be?

34
00:02:58,666 --> 00:02:59,894
- What?
- The gang.

35
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,528
The gang? No, they don't
call themselves a gang.

36
00:03:02,603 --> 00:03:04,764
- What do they call themselves?
- They're a team.

37
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:08,366
- They call themselves a team.
- How is it the team came to be?

38
00:03:09,344 --> 00:03:11,505
Well, that's
a whole lot of history.

39
00:03:12,747 --> 00:03:15,079
I've got time.

40
00:03:15,149 --> 00:03:17,413
Vince grew up with my brother.

41
00:03:17,485 --> 00:03:20,682
He didn't ever actually grow up,
as you can tell.

42
00:03:21,322 --> 00:03:25,554
But they were friends as kids.
And Letty, she lived down the street.

43
00:03:25,626 --> 00:03:28,925
Always into cars, though,
ever since she was ten years old.

44
00:03:28,997 --> 00:03:33,127
So, naturally,
my brother always had her attention.

45
00:03:33,201 --> 00:03:37,331
- And then she turned 16...
- And then she had Dom's attention.

46
00:03:37,405 --> 00:03:41,068
Yeah. Yeah, it's funny
how that works, isn't it?

47
00:03:41,142 --> 00:03:42,074
Yeah.

48
00:03:45,813 --> 00:03:47,906
How is it that Jesse
fits into the whole thing?

49
00:03:49,117 --> 00:03:51,984
Well, Jesse and Leon
just sort of showed up one night...

50
00:03:52,053 --> 00:03:53,748
and never ever left.

51
00:03:54,355 --> 00:03:57,188
It's just the way my brother is.
Dom's like...

52
00:03:58,926 --> 00:04:00,860
He's like gravity.

53
00:04:01,996 --> 00:04:04,226
Everything just gets
pulled to him.

54
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,561
Even you.

55
00:04:12,774 --> 00:04:15,538
The only thing
that pulled me in was you.

56
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:17,942
Being friends with your brother
is just a bonus.

57
00:04:21,315 --> 00:04:22,907
That's good.

58
00:04:24,786 --> 00:04:28,688
That's good. That's nice
to come first every once in a while.

59
00:04:32,093 --> 00:04:33,583
You wanna go for a drive?

60
00:05:11,632 --> 00:05:13,827
- Yeah?
- The hijackers have hit again.

61
00:05:13,901 --> 00:05:16,392
Bilkins made his decision.
We're gonna move on Johnny Tran...

62
00:05:16,471 --> 00:05:20,999
and his guys at 1700 hours,
unless you say otherwise.

63
00:05:21,075 --> 00:05:23,771
If you agree, just say yes.

64
00:05:23,845 --> 00:05:25,938
- Yeah.
- Who is that?

65
00:05:27,682 --> 00:05:29,616
Just a wrong number.

66
00:08:21,782 --> 00:08:23,807
Yes, sir. Yeah, I know, but...

67
00:08:23,884 --> 00:08:26,580
Yeah, yeah. Yes. Yes, sir.

68
00:08:26,653 --> 00:08:28,644
Yeah. I got it.

69
00:08:32,926 --> 00:08:34,894
The DVD players
were purchased legally.

70
00:08:34,962 --> 00:08:38,090
All we've got on Tran and company
are a couple of weapons charges...

71
00:08:38,165 --> 00:08:40,690
and some outstanding
speeding tickets.

72
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:45,170
- So they're out.
- Yeah. Father bailed 'em out.

73
00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:48,333
Is this the kind of intelligence
I can expect from you, O'Conner?

74
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,808
- You're gonna put this on me?
- I can put it on whoever I want to.

75
00:08:56,883 --> 00:09:00,114
- Perks of the job.
- No way you're gonna put this on me.

76
00:09:00,187 --> 00:09:01,779
Wait a minute.
Let me tell you.

77
00:09:01,855 --> 00:09:03,618
I don't care if you have to
put a gun to someone's head...

78
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,124
and blow your cover
to smithereens.

79
00:09:06,193 --> 00:09:08,684
You got 36 hours
to crack this bastard...

80
00:09:08,762 --> 00:09:11,287
or you might wanna be thinkin'
about another career.

81
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:26,434
It's Toretto, Brian.
It always has been Toretto.

82
00:09:27,748 --> 00:09:31,548
Tran and Hector are...
They're just fumes.

83
00:09:34,988 --> 00:09:37,718
Well, I know you've been lying to me.
My question is this:

84
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,487
Have you been lying to yourself
because you can't see past Mia?

85
00:09:44,164 --> 00:09:47,031
He won't go back to prison.

86
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,001
Well, that's a choice
he's going to have to make.

87
00:09:54,141 --> 00:09:56,439
There's all kinds
of family, Brian.

88
00:09:58,011 --> 00:10:01,003
That's a choice
you're gonna have to make.

89
00:10:18,765 --> 00:10:21,325
You ready for this, jumpy?

90
00:10:22,869 --> 00:10:23,801
Yeah.

91
00:10:46,927 --> 00:10:50,158
Nice car. What's the retail
on one of those?

92
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:53,666
More than
you can afford, pal. Ferrari.

93
00:10:59,539 --> 00:11:00,471
Smoke 'im.

94
00:11:55,695 --> 00:12:00,189
- So what's wrong, Brian?
- Nothin', man. I'm fine.

95
00:12:00,267 --> 00:12:04,101
Come on.
Obviously something's off.

96
00:12:04,171 --> 00:12:08,301
Look. I have my good days, and I
have my bad days, like anybody else.

97
00:12:08,909 --> 00:12:12,345
Brian, don't lose that cool.
That's your meal ticket.

98
00:12:14,381 --> 00:12:17,316
My meal ticket? What?
I can't pay for my own shrimp?

99
00:12:17,384 --> 00:12:20,842
- I got your shrimp.
- That's one thing about me.

100
00:12:20,921 --> 00:12:23,754
You don't understand. I don't need
handouts. I don't take handouts.

101
00:12:23,824 --> 00:12:25,621
I earn my way, every step.

102
00:12:26,726 --> 00:12:28,921
I just gotta make a little something
extra on the side, like you.

103
00:12:28,995 --> 00:12:31,190
What do you mean, like me?

104
00:12:31,264 --> 00:12:34,199
- What's that supposed to mean?
- That's what I mean.

105
00:12:34,267 --> 00:12:37,202
- What does that mean, like me?
- Don't try...

106
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,397
I'm not stupid, all right?

107
00:12:39,473 --> 00:12:43,534
I know there's no way you paid
for all that shit under the hood...

108
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:47,068
There's no way you paid for all that
shit under the hood of those cars...

109
00:12:47,147 --> 00:12:49,479
by doing tune-ups
and selling groceries.

110
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,412
Now, whatever it is you're in on,
I want in on it too.

111
00:13:16,773 --> 00:13:19,298
- What is this?
- Read it.

112
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,935
- What is this for?
- It's directions.

113
00:13:24,047 --> 00:13:27,881
To Race Wars.
We'll see how you do.

114
00:13:29,118 --> 00:13:31,211
Then we'll talk.

115
00:14:16,866 --> 00:14:18,265
- How's it goin', bro?
- What's up, man?

116
00:14:18,334 --> 00:14:20,097
Welcome to Race Wars.

117
00:14:20,169 --> 00:14:22,433
Great. Thanks a lot.

118
00:14:44,427 --> 00:14:46,019
Baby. Hey, baby.

119
00:14:47,764 --> 00:14:51,222
You should watch from the side.
I wouldn't want to get exhaust on you.

120
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:55,236
- Put your money where your mouth is?
- How 'bout I race you for that ass?

121
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:58,133
You want ass, why don't you
hit Hollywood Boulevard?

122
00:14:58,207 --> 00:15:01,768
You want an adrenaline rush,
it'll be two large.

123
00:15:01,844 --> 00:15:04,404
Right here, right now.
What's it gonna be?

124
00:15:07,316 --> 00:15:08,578
You got it.

125
00:15:28,871 --> 00:15:30,566
Another one bites the dust.

126
00:15:34,043 --> 00:15:36,443
Come on. What do you got?
What ya got?

127
00:15:36,512 --> 00:15:38,343
See ya.

128
00:16:13,449 --> 00:16:15,784
Whoa. Bri, what's up?

129
00:16:15,852 --> 00:16:18,912
What's up, Jesse?
What do you have in your hand?

130
00:16:18,988 --> 00:16:21,821
Throwing down the pink slip,
just like you.

131
00:16:21,891 --> 00:16:24,485
- The pink slip to what? TheJetta?
- Yeah.

132
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,085
- You can't bet your dad's car.
- It's all right.

133
00:16:27,163 --> 00:16:32,328
I ain't losin'. This fool
is runnin' a Honda 2000. I'll win.

134
00:16:32,401 --> 00:16:36,565
That way, me and my dad can roll
together when he gets out of prison.

135
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,402
They're gonna throw him right back
in prison after he kills you.

136
00:16:38,474 --> 00:16:40,635
Shit. I'm up.

137
00:16:48,251 --> 00:16:51,982
Visualize the win.
Visualize the win, Jesse.

138
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:54,716
- I'm serious. Listen to me, man.
- Who you racin'?

139
00:17:01,197 --> 00:17:04,189
Don't do it. I bet you he's got more
than a hundred grand under the hood.

140
00:17:28,524 --> 00:17:30,583
Too soon, junior.

141
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,590
Shit!

142
00:17:39,669 --> 00:17:41,432
Oh, God.

143
00:17:51,447 --> 00:17:54,382
Heads up, bro. We got problems.

144
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,884
- What?
- Jesse.

145
00:17:57,887 --> 00:18:00,947
- Where's Jesse goin'?
- He just raced Tran for slips.

146
00:18:01,023 --> 00:18:03,548
Oh, shit.

147
00:18:15,104 --> 00:18:18,005
- Where's he going?
- He went to the car wash.

148
00:18:18,074 --> 00:18:20,235
Whatever. Go fetch my car.

149
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:25,176
Go fetch your car?
We're not on your block anymore.

150
00:18:25,247 --> 00:18:27,340
You'd better watch
who you talk to like that.

151
00:18:32,989 --> 00:18:37,517
SWAT came into my house,
disrespected my whole family...

152
00:18:37,593 --> 00:18:39,925
because somebody narced me out.

153
00:18:40,696 --> 00:18:42,823
And you know what? It was you!

154
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,005
Go! Let him go!

155
00:19:07,723 --> 00:19:10,556
Get off of him!
Get off of him!

156
00:19:18,601 --> 00:19:20,796
Dom, chill out, man.
Come on. Let's go.

157
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:24,704
I never narced on nobody!
I never narced on nobody!

158
00:20:12,455 --> 00:20:15,891
- I'm asking you not to go.
- I'm doing this for both of us.

159
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:17,892
Don't give me that crap.
You're doing this for you.

160
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,594
- Why are you asking me to stay?
- Why do you insist on doing this?

161
00:20:20,727 --> 00:20:22,786
Dom, please, don't.

162
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:37,532
- What's goin' on?
- What?

163
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,171
- You know what I'm talkin' about.
- No, I don't, Brian.

164
00:20:40,246 --> 00:20:43,409
So what? You always have tears
in your eyes when Dom drives away?

165
00:20:43,483 --> 00:20:45,348
- What is the matter with you?
- Come on.

166
00:20:45,418 --> 00:20:47,477
What's your brother racin' off
in the middle of the night for?

167
00:20:47,554 --> 00:20:49,078
I'm talkin' about the trucks.
You know about the trucks?

168
00:20:49,155 --> 00:20:51,385
No, Brian. What trucks?

169
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,085
Jesus Christ.

170
00:20:53,159 --> 00:20:56,185
- What?
- Listen to me.

171
00:20:56,262 --> 00:20:58,730
Mia, I'm a cop.

172
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:00,993
What are you talking about, Brian?
What is this?

173
00:21:01,835 --> 00:21:04,827
Ever since the first time I met you,
I've been undercover.

174
00:21:06,706 --> 00:21:08,139
I'm a cop.

175
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:14,840
You bastard.

176
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,611
You bastard.

177
00:21:21,121 --> 00:21:23,316
Get off of me, Brian!

178
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:25,858
Listen to me!

179
00:21:25,925 --> 00:21:29,827
Everything I ever said I felt
about you was real, I swear to God.

180
00:21:29,896 --> 00:21:33,195
You have to believe me. But right now,
this isn't about you and me.

181
00:21:33,266 --> 00:21:35,996
Your brother's about to pull a job,
and we're almost out of time.

182
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:38,731
Those truckers, they're not
laying down anymore.

183
00:21:38,805 --> 00:21:41,672
They may make it through the night,
but every law enforcement agency...

184
00:21:41,741 --> 00:21:43,333
in California
is comin' down on 'em.

185
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:46,010
If you don't want anything to happen
to your brother, to Letty...

186
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:48,946
to Leon, to Vince, you have to just
get in that car with me right now.

187
00:21:49,015 --> 00:21:50,949
You have to help me.

188
00:21:51,785 --> 00:21:55,186
Mia, you are the only person
that can help me right now.

189
00:21:55,889 --> 00:21:59,188
Please, Mia. Please help me.

190
00:22:10,937 --> 00:22:13,906
Civics are stashed somewhere
outside of Thermal.

191
00:22:13,973 --> 00:22:17,534
They wouldn't double back.
And Highway 10's too well-patrolled...

192
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:18,702
so what does that
leave us with then?

193
00:22:18,778 --> 00:22:20,473
That leaves us with all this.

194
00:22:29,355 --> 00:22:32,256
- Nextel.
- Yes, this is Officer O'Conner...

195
00:22:32,325 --> 00:22:34,987
serial number 34762.

196
00:22:35,061 --> 00:22:36,926
I need a cell phone trace.

197
00:22:36,996 --> 00:22:39,863
- What's the cell number?
- Mia, what's the cell phone number?

198
00:22:42,268 --> 00:22:44,828
Come on, Mia. She needs
Dom's cell phone number now.

199
00:22:48,108 --> 00:22:53,011
323-555-6439.

200
00:22:54,514 --> 00:22:57,415
Thank you. You get that?

201
00:23:23,343 --> 00:23:26,710
All right. We're one man short.
Letty, I need you on the left side.

202
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:32,479
Your sister's right about this one.
This don't feel good.

203
00:23:32,552 --> 00:23:34,611
Don't do that.

204
00:23:35,722 --> 00:23:37,622
- Something's wrong.
- Stop.

205
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:39,749
We shouldn't be doing this
without Jesse.

206
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,893
Look. This is the mother lode.
We've been on this for three months.

207
00:23:43,963 --> 00:23:46,454
After this, it's a long vacation
for everyone.

208
00:23:46,533 --> 00:23:48,967
- Let's go.
- I hope so.

209
00:23:52,172 --> 00:23:56,233
Listen. The other night
I had a dream that you and I...

210
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,834
were on a beach in Mexico.

211
00:23:58,912 --> 00:24:00,470
- Really?
- Really.

212
00:24:04,017 --> 00:24:06,281
Come on.
Let's make this happen.

213
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:13,124
- Keep on those scanners.
- Copy that.

214
00:24:16,996 --> 00:24:18,930
All right. Let's go.

215
00:24:29,075 --> 00:24:30,007
Yeah?

216
00:24:30,076 --> 00:24:32,772
We traced the number
to the northbound 86...

217
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:35,679
mile 114 outside Coachella.

218
00:24:35,748 --> 00:24:38,376
- We'll keep the trace open.
- Let me see this.

219
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,886
All right. I think
we're about 40 miles away.

220
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,723
What are you gonna do?

221
00:24:49,762 --> 00:24:52,094
What are you gonna do?

222
00:25:24,063 --> 00:25:26,156
Okay! Go time!

223
00:25:41,848 --> 00:25:43,907
We're all good, man.
I got nothin' on the scanners.

224
00:25:43,983 --> 00:25:45,245
Keep goin'.

225
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:03,901
Don't! Get back in!

226
00:26:12,545 --> 00:26:16,481
- He's got a damn shotgun!
- Back off! Get him off of there!

227
00:26:19,485 --> 00:26:20,952
Shit.

228
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:34,065
Get me off this thing!
Pull up!

229
00:26:35,401 --> 00:26:37,961
- Unhook yourself!
- Come back!

230
00:26:38,037 --> 00:26:40,267
- Do it!
- Pull up!

231
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,808
- I can't...
- You can do it!

232
00:26:41,941 --> 00:26:43,602
Pull up! I'll jump!

233
00:26:43,676 --> 00:26:45,337
Come on!

234
00:26:53,252 --> 00:26:55,652
I'm pullin' up to distract him.

235
00:27:02,695 --> 00:27:05,289
Come on, boy.

236
00:27:05,364 --> 00:27:06,991
Shot doesn't get better than this.

237
00:27:12,438 --> 00:27:14,633
Son of a bitch!

238
00:27:18,277 --> 00:27:20,802
Take me off of here.
I'm gonna unhook the wire.

239
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:25,146
Try it again.
One, two, three!

240
00:27:37,263 --> 00:27:40,061
Unhook yourself!

241
00:27:40,132 --> 00:27:43,898
- I can't get my arm free!
- Vince, grab my hand!

242
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:46,336
- My arm!
- Listen! Give me your hand!

243
00:27:46,405 --> 00:27:48,498
- I can't get my hand free!
- I'm gonna pull you off!

244
00:27:54,213 --> 00:27:57,410
Dominic, hold on!
Listen to me!

245
00:28:06,325 --> 00:28:07,383
Shit!

246
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:13,160
Hold on!

247
00:28:14,467 --> 00:28:16,594
Move out of the way!
I'm comin' to get him!

248
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,423
- Yo?
- Pull back for Letty.

249
00:28:46,499 --> 00:28:49,400
- Get her out of there!
- I'm on it! Go!

250
00:28:58,177 --> 00:29:00,372
I got her!
You get Vince off that truck!

251
00:29:07,653 --> 00:29:09,621
Come on, baby.

252
00:29:09,689 --> 00:29:11,554
You okay?

253
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:14,593
Come on, girl. You all right?
Come on. Let me look at you.

254
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,890
Come on. We gotta go.
Let's go.

255
00:29:59,605 --> 00:30:02,369
- Take the wheel!
- What do you mean?

256
00:30:02,441 --> 00:30:03,931
Put your foot on the gas!

257
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,841
- What the hell are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna get him.

258
00:30:05,911 --> 00:30:08,539
- Put your foot on the gas!
- Okay!

259
00:30:12,518 --> 00:30:15,487
- All right. Keep it steady.
- I got it!

260
00:30:16,722 --> 00:30:18,883
All right. Hold on, Vince!

261
00:30:19,959 --> 00:30:22,291
He's having a hard time holding on!
Get me a little closer!

262
00:30:22,361 --> 00:30:23,293
All right!

263
00:30:24,497 --> 00:30:26,863
- Closer!
- I'm moving in!

264
00:30:26,932 --> 00:30:29,298
Hold it right there!

265
00:30:30,536 --> 00:30:35,200
- Go!
- You gotta hang in with me!

266
00:30:35,274 --> 00:30:37,469
We're gonna get you off this thing!
Give me your arm!

267
00:30:37,543 --> 00:30:39,841
Look at me. Don't let go.

268
00:30:43,849 --> 00:30:46,340
Come on, Vince!
Throw this arm around me!

269
00:30:48,087 --> 00:30:49,918
Don't let go.

270
00:30:53,592 --> 00:30:55,253
Come on, Vince! Get closer!

271
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,225
Vince, get closer! Come on!

272
00:31:03,302 --> 00:31:04,394
Here we go.

273
00:31:09,575 --> 00:31:11,440
Gotta jump.

274
00:31:32,665 --> 00:31:34,098
Shit.

275
00:31:38,537 --> 00:31:41,631
It's gonna be okay, baby.
I love you.

276
00:31:44,877 --> 00:31:45,809
Watch her.

277
00:31:47,546 --> 00:31:49,480
Come on, Vince.
Hang in there!

278
00:31:54,186 --> 00:31:56,211
If we don't get him to an ambulance
in ten minutes, he's dead.

279
00:31:57,456 --> 00:31:58,718
- Hold this. Hold the pressure.
- I got it.

280
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:00,315
Don't let go. Hold his arm up.

281
00:32:06,065 --> 00:32:09,660
Yeah. Yeah,
this is Officer Brian O'Conner.

282
00:32:09,735 --> 00:32:11,896
I'm off-duty M.A.P.D.

283
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:13,996
I need a life flight rollout
right away.

284
00:32:15,674 --> 00:32:19,337
My twenty is Highway 86,
mile marker 147.

285
00:32:20,412 --> 00:32:24,314
I got one trauma victim,
about 24 years of age, six foot...

286
00:32:24,383 --> 00:32:26,180
maybe 200 pounds.

287
00:32:26,252 --> 00:32:29,346
He's got a deep laceration to his
right arm with arterial bleeding.

288
00:32:30,089 --> 00:32:34,549
And he's got a shotgun wound,
close-range, to his left leg.

289
00:32:34,627 --> 00:32:36,288
Yeah.

290
00:32:36,362 --> 00:32:39,126
Yeah. And he's going into shock.

291
00:34:18,364 --> 00:34:21,060
Put the gun down now!

292
00:34:22,668 --> 00:34:26,104
- Move your car.
- Bullshit. Put it down now!

293
00:34:26,171 --> 00:34:28,969
- No more running.
- I'm not running!

294
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:34,370
- Where's Leon and Letty?
- They're long gone.

295
00:34:34,446 --> 00:34:37,643
Then it's over. I didn't
call the police, but don't push me.

296
00:34:37,716 --> 00:34:40,651
- Put the gun down! I swear to Go...
- You are the cop!

297
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,277
You're a cop!

298
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:46,981
Brian, I gotta find Jesse
before they do.

299
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:50,028
- I'm all the kid's got.
- I'll call in the plates.

300
00:34:50,095 --> 00:34:53,223
P.D.'ll pick 'im up way before
Johnny even gets near 'im.

301
00:34:54,166 --> 00:34:57,135
- Move your car.
- Dom, stop it! It's over! Please!

302
00:34:57,202 --> 00:35:00,899
Mia, stay out of it.
Move the...

303
00:35:06,378 --> 00:35:10,007
I am so sorry.
I don't know what I'm doin'.

304
00:35:11,216 --> 00:35:14,617
I'm so scared right now.
I don't know what's goin' on.

305
00:35:16,855 --> 00:35:19,415
- What were you thinkin', man?
- I don't know. I panicked.

306
00:35:19,491 --> 00:35:24,155
I'm sorry. I don't know what I'm doing.
Will you please help me?

307
00:39:04,816 --> 00:39:07,808
Call 911. You, call 911!

308
00:39:42,821 --> 00:39:46,188
I used to drag here
back in high school.

309
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:50,558
That railroad crossing up there
is exactly a quarter-mile away.

310
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:54,065
On green, I'm goin' for it.

311
00:42:28,752 --> 00:42:31,243
That's not what I had in mind.

312
00:43:17,701 --> 00:43:22,104
- You know what you're doin'?
- I owe you a ten-second car.

313
00:50:35,901 --> 00:50:38,597
I live my life a quarter-mile
at a time.

314
00:50:40,238 --> 00:50:42,001
Nothing else matters.

315
00:50:43,075 --> 00:50:45,635
For those ten seconds or less...

316
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:47,769
I'm free.
