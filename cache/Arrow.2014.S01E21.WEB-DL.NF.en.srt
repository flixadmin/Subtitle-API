Those guys would make me
the minute I walked in.

Oliver Queen would never be
in a place like that.

I wasn't talking about you.

-Absolutely not.
-I can count cards.

-Felicity...
-Oliver, the reason I joined you...

167

...in the first place was to find Walter.

For the first time,
we have a real chance at finding him.

-And doing this...

...won't give it back.

When she called my cell phone for the
first time, I remember being annoyed.

She knew I was busy, so I just let it ring.

188

...I shut my phone off.

190
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:35,612
A little after midnight, two S.C.P.D.
officers showed up at my office.

191

All I remember them saying was...

...she'd been shot.

193

Murdered. In the Glades.

00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,127
After the cops left...

195
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:55,006
...I sat in my office the rest of the night,
listening to Rebecca's messages.

She kept calling my name.

Asking for help.

198
00:12:08,937 --> 00:12:11,439
Until she was just struggling
to breathe.

Gasping for air.
