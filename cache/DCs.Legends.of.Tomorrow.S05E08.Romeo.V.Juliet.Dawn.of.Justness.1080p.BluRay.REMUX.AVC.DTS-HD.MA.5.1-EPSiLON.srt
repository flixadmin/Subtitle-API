1
00:00:01,795 --> 00:00:03,273
<i>Previously on</i>
Legends of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:03,297 --> 00:00:06,300
- I plan on asking Nora to marry me.
- Yes.

3
00:00:06,383 --> 00:00:08,319
You don't understand
how dangerous that Loom is, John-o.

4
00:00:08,343 --> 00:00:10,512
Come on, Charlie.
We use the Loom to help Astra,

5
00:00:10,596 --> 00:00:13,348
and then I will help you
destroy it forever. Deal?

6
00:00:13,432 --> 00:00:15,350
Someone's trashing
Rebecca Silver online.

7
00:00:15,434 --> 00:00:16,494
Cute. You have a troll.

8
00:00:16,518 --> 00:00:18,061
- This your kid?
- She's your kid, too.

9
00:00:18,145 --> 00:00:19,855
<i>Nora belongs
in the real world...</i>

10
00:00:19,938 --> 00:00:21,064
I need you to support her.

11
00:00:21,148 --> 00:00:22,667
<i>And she can't do it
on that ship of yours.</i>

12
00:00:22,691 --> 00:00:23,692
Do the right thing, son.

13
00:00:42,294 --> 00:00:43,294
Morning, babe.

14
00:00:44,755 --> 00:00:45,755
Hey.

15
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:48,633
You okay?

16
00:00:49,134 --> 00:00:51,553
Actually, I was thinking
about your dad.

17
00:00:52,596 --> 00:00:53,931
That's romantic.

18
00:00:54,765 --> 00:00:56,391
Thinking about something he said to me.

19
00:00:57,893 --> 00:00:59,561
When I committed my life to you,

20
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:01,979
I meant it.

21
00:01:02,356 --> 00:01:03,440
So I've been thinking...

22
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:06,902
maybe our life together
isn't on this ship.

23
00:01:08,195 --> 00:01:12,074
Maybe it's time for us
to move on... and move out.

24
00:01:12,616 --> 00:01:13,616
Together.

25
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:16,828
Oh, hey.

26
00:01:17,537 --> 00:01:21,208
Listen, I wanna build a life with you
wherever we are.

27
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:23,001
I know, but...

28
00:01:24,086 --> 00:01:26,129
you can't really
do your job on a Timeship.

29
00:01:26,797 --> 00:01:28,006
What about the Legends?

30
00:01:28,382 --> 00:01:29,883
They've become my family.

31
00:01:29,967 --> 00:01:32,344
But we can't begin our life together...

32
00:01:32,886 --> 00:01:35,889
when I literally have
one foot in the past.

33
00:01:36,223 --> 00:01:39,893
So I think I'll do one last mission
with the team.

34
00:01:42,187 --> 00:01:43,187
Say goodbye.

35
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,483
Wow.

36
00:01:48,193 --> 00:01:49,278
Are we doing this?

37
00:01:50,612 --> 00:01:51,612
Yeah.

38
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:54,324
- Okay.
- Okay.

39
00:01:54,449 --> 00:01:55,449
Okay.

40
00:01:58,328 --> 00:01:59,328
Mmm.

41
00:02:00,122 --> 00:02:01,722
Yeah, but maybe
after we brush our teeth?

42
00:02:02,457 --> 00:02:03,457
Okay.

43
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:08,255
Come on! Is she still in there?

44
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:10,882
Zari, there's a line.

45
00:02:10,966 --> 00:02:14,511
I'm doing my hair. You can't stop
the glam routine mid-process.

46
00:02:14,678 --> 00:02:16,430
Come on, we talked about this!

47
00:02:16,596 --> 00:02:19,099
- Ooh, let me guess. Zari?
- Uh-huh.

48
00:02:19,182 --> 00:02:21,101
Hey, what happened
to the sign-up sheet I made?

49
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:24,938
Oh, Mick burned it in frustration
after Zari's last Korean Sheet Mask day.

50
00:02:25,022 --> 00:02:29,401
Well, I guess now is as good a time
as any to tell you two that...

51
00:02:30,402 --> 00:02:32,112
Nora and I have some big news.

52
00:02:32,195 --> 00:02:34,448
We're talking big news?
Because, guys, I got a whopper.

53
00:02:34,906 --> 00:02:36,867
I told John we'll help him
find the Loom of Fate.

54
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:37,908
Nuh-uh. You know the rules.

55
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:40,203
No MacGuffin talk until after
I've finished my coffee.

56
00:02:40,287 --> 00:02:42,724
Yeah. And besides, you guys were
about to make a big announcement?

57
00:02:42,748 --> 00:02:43,664
Yes.

58
00:02:43,665 --> 00:02:45,810
Is it time for morning announcements?
'Cause I need you all to know,

59
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:47,544
I have to go so badly.

60
00:02:47,961 --> 00:02:50,547
If my sister ever leaves the bathroom!

61
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,548
- B!
- Come on.

62
00:02:51,549 --> 00:02:54,843
Hey, bro, let's not pretend like
you don't take this long with your hair.

63
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:55,969
Get in line.

64
00:02:56,053 --> 00:02:58,638
Bathrooms are also for other things.

65
00:02:58,722 --> 00:03:00,474
And in other announcements...

66
00:03:00,557 --> 00:03:01,683
She still in there?

67
00:03:02,726 --> 00:03:05,062
I would be too
if I had all that damn hair.

68
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:08,774
Okay, well, this is the perfect time,
now that we're all here,

69
00:03:09,316 --> 00:03:12,444
to let you know that Nora and I...

70
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:14,404
- You're moving out.
- Mmm?

71
00:03:14,696 --> 00:03:15,614
How'd you know that?

72
00:03:15,615 --> 00:03:18,493
Well, you got married.
Next logical step in a relationship.

73
00:03:18,575 --> 00:03:22,746
And by the way, I heard you two
going at it like jackrabbits last night.

74
00:03:23,455 --> 00:03:24,515
At least someone's
getting it.

75
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:25,540
Oh, my God.

76
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:28,752
Look, after one final mission...

77
00:03:29,795 --> 00:03:31,338
Nora and I will be leaving.

78
00:03:31,505 --> 00:03:32,815
- Aw, I'm gonna miss you, man.
- Wait. For real?

79
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:34,216
- Seriously?
- Congrats.

80
00:03:34,383 --> 00:03:36,176
I mean, we always knew
this day would come,

81
00:03:36,259 --> 00:03:38,387
but I never thought it would be so soon.

82
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,596
How are you gonna tell Nate?

83
00:03:39,679 --> 00:03:40,919
- Tell Nate what?
- What?

84
00:03:45,185 --> 00:03:46,311
Hmm?

85
00:03:48,855 --> 00:03:51,691
The wait for the bathroom is upwards
of 30 minutes. Can you believe it?

86
00:03:51,775 --> 00:03:52,901
Hey, take it easy.

87
00:03:52,984 --> 00:03:55,487
At least I get to wait in line
with the happy new couple.

88
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:59,074
Nora, welcome to your
new morning routine. Uptown!

89
00:04:01,785 --> 00:04:03,787
- Thank God.
- Good morning. Good morning.

90
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:05,414
Damn, she looks good.

91
00:04:06,832 --> 00:04:07,832
Glam complete.

92
00:04:09,543 --> 00:04:11,545
You guys could really
work on your hygiene.

93
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:13,130
It's 7:15.

94
00:04:26,309 --> 00:04:28,562
Mick! There you are.

95
00:04:30,147 --> 00:04:31,147
Mona.

96
00:04:31,731 --> 00:04:33,066
Consent to hug you?

97
00:04:35,318 --> 00:04:36,736
I'll take that as a no.

98
00:04:37,696 --> 00:04:38,864
So what's new?

99
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:43,702
Any torrid affairs, flourishing
romances, lovers left behind?

100
00:04:43,785 --> 00:04:46,746
Rebecca Silver could always
use fresh inspiration.

101
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:48,038
No.

102
00:04:48,248 --> 00:04:51,042
Anyway, had to be here
for Nora's first book club

103
00:04:51,126 --> 00:04:52,419
as a married woman.

104
00:04:52,502 --> 00:04:55,505
And speaking of books,
I could use your advice.

105
00:04:55,589 --> 00:04:57,841
Rebecca Silver has been
besieged by a troll.

106
00:04:57,924 --> 00:05:00,260
Forget about her. I mean "him." Whoever.

107
00:05:00,635 --> 00:05:04,014
Well, I tried that, and it didn't stop.
I was thinking of reaching out.

108
00:05:04,097 --> 00:05:06,349
Don't. It's just gonna
make you feel worse.

109
00:05:06,433 --> 00:05:07,851
Well, I think it's a cry for help.

110
00:05:07,934 --> 00:05:09,769
Maybe someone just needs
to show them love.

111
00:05:09,853 --> 00:05:11,313
It's got nothing to do with love!

112
00:05:16,443 --> 00:05:18,653
Hey. I was packing up my stuff
in the lab,

113
00:05:18,737 --> 00:05:20,339
and I noticed
that Marie Antoinette is gone,

114
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:22,157
and the jars of Rasputin are empty.

115
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,367
Astra must have recalled
their souls to hell.

116
00:05:24,451 --> 00:05:26,828
Damien said something
about "eternal torture."

117
00:05:27,662 --> 00:05:29,623
So, um... packing, huh?

118
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,291
You talk to Nate yet?

119
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:35,086
Ah. When I saw his face back there,
I just couldn't.

120
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,880
He was so excited
about us living together.

121
00:05:37,005 --> 00:05:40,008
I just have to wait
for the perfect moment, you know?

122
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:42,552
Look, I say just get it over with.

123
00:05:42,636 --> 00:05:44,971
And then you guys can enjoy
your last "hoorah" together.

124
00:05:45,347 --> 00:05:48,642
Yeah. Saying goodbye to Nate,
it's my biggest mission yet.

125
00:05:48,725 --> 00:05:50,060
Mmm-hmm.

126
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:52,938
I did go to the moon once,
so second biggest.

127
00:05:55,774 --> 00:05:57,150
The Loom of Fate.

128
00:05:57,234 --> 00:05:59,736
Eons ago, I tossed it
through space and time...

129
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,905
because it was too dangerous.

130
00:06:01,988 --> 00:06:04,991
But now, for all my sins, we're
gonna piece it back together again.

131
00:06:05,075 --> 00:06:07,494
And finally put an end
to our Encore problem.

132
00:06:07,577 --> 00:06:10,413
By rewriting Astra's life
and setting her on the right path.

133
00:06:10,497 --> 00:06:13,416
Yeah, speaking of life changes...

134
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:20,298
Must be a life-changing experience
for you, Charlie,

135
00:06:20,382 --> 00:06:23,009
to know that the Loom
is back on our Earth.

136
00:06:23,134 --> 00:06:25,095
- Charlie?
- Yeah, it is.

137
00:06:25,554 --> 00:06:27,556
But there's only one piece
whose spot I'm sure of.

138
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:29,575
I gave it to a close mate
of mine for safekeeping.

139
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:32,060
All right, so we'll go back
to right after you dropped it off.

140
00:06:32,894 --> 00:06:33,894
That's our move.

141
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:36,856
And, uh, speaking of moves...

142
00:06:38,858 --> 00:06:41,319
Let's get a move on it.

143
00:06:41,403 --> 00:06:42,571
Where are we headed, Charlie?

144
00:06:42,988 --> 00:06:46,324
Well, the last place I left it
was in London, 1594.

145
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:47,784
Gideon, set a course.

146
00:06:47,867 --> 00:06:51,371
Affirmative, Captain.
And speaking of setting a new course...

147
00:06:52,706 --> 00:06:54,249
Of course, she means...

148
00:06:54,332 --> 00:06:58,044
Sara, please give us one of those
terrific period-specific send-offs.

149
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:00,129
Fine.

150
00:07:01,423 --> 00:07:05,176
Enjoy the jolly old London, you blokes!

151
00:07:08,638 --> 00:07:10,181
That was... that was bad.

152
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:11,975
And, frankly, offensive.

153
00:07:20,734 --> 00:07:24,279
Oh, it warms my cockles to know
that Londoners haven't changed a bit.

154
00:07:24,654 --> 00:07:26,531
Let's find this bloody Loom piece,
shall we?

155
00:07:26,615 --> 00:07:28,617
Well, I've disguised the pieces
as rings.

156
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,460
And this one, I gave
to a close mate of mine.

157
00:07:30,493 --> 00:07:32,495
And if I know him, he'll be here.

158
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:34,247
Wasn't a day he didn't stop by
for a pint.

159
00:07:34,331 --> 00:07:35,665
Why stop at one pint?

160
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:38,793
Hmm. Well, found our guy.

161
00:07:39,252 --> 00:07:40,210
Will the Quill.

162
00:07:40,211 --> 00:07:43,049
You didn't tell me you were friends
with the real William Shakespeare.

163
00:07:43,548 --> 00:07:44,948
I didn't wanna name-drop.

164
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:49,721
Pardon the intrusion, squire.

165
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:52,265
We have the knowledge
that you came into possession

166
00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:55,352
of a particular ring
some several days past.

167
00:07:56,186 --> 00:07:58,438
I know not of what you speak,
good constables.

168
00:07:58,855 --> 00:08:00,607
And why should anyone hand me a ring?

169
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,317
Do I appear as a jeweler to thine eyes?

170
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,196
It's a pity! Because that ring
was stolen from the...

171
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,199
- Duke...
- And... And he wants it back!

172
00:08:09,282 --> 00:08:10,533
And if it were to be discovered

173
00:08:10,617 --> 00:08:13,078
that someone had lied
about its whereabouts...

174
00:08:14,371 --> 00:08:16,831
let's just say, heads would roll.

175
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,751
Yes! Yes, the ring.

176
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:21,878
- Ah.
- The ring. Now, I remember it well.

177
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,672
Would that I could yield it for you,

178
00:08:23,755 --> 00:08:25,757
but I just sold that very ring
of which you speak.

179
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,218
What? You sold it already,
you lousy git?

180
00:08:28,593 --> 00:08:29,953
It was by necessity.

181
00:08:30,553 --> 00:08:32,847
See, a stubborn case of writer's block

182
00:08:32,931 --> 00:08:37,602
is preventing me from finding the ending
to my new play, <i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

183
00:08:37,686 --> 00:08:39,521
Sounds like an instant classic.

184
00:08:39,604 --> 00:08:43,233
My producer, Philip Henslowe,
has threatened to remove me of hands

185
00:08:43,316 --> 00:08:45,527
by way of sword if I can't finish.

186
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:49,072
Thus, I gave him the ring in exchange
for more time.

187
00:08:49,155 --> 00:08:51,783
If I can't bring my story to a close,

188
00:08:52,117 --> 00:08:55,620
my career is over.

189
00:08:56,621 --> 00:08:58,248
So much for quick and easy.

190
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:09,259
Discussing <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>
in Elizabethan England.

191
00:09:09,342 --> 00:09:11,302
- Hmm.
- Ava, you needed me?

192
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:14,681
Sorry, is this an intervention?

193
00:09:14,764 --> 00:09:18,935
No, no, no, no, no.
So, since you're a member of the team,

194
00:09:19,018 --> 00:09:20,812
we wanted to invite you to book club!

195
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,021
Oh.

196
00:09:22,105 --> 00:09:25,358
That is very sweet, but I actually
have a lot on my plate right now,

197
00:09:25,442 --> 00:09:27,986
so I don't really have time
to talk about books.

198
00:09:28,653 --> 00:09:30,053
The thing about book club is, uh...

199
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:31,683
we don't really talk about books.

200
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:35,034
- Mmm-mmm.
- Because book club is magic.

201
00:09:35,118 --> 00:09:37,954
What she means is,
book club is a place

202
00:09:38,037 --> 00:09:40,766
where you can hang out with your friends
and talk about your problems.

203
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,792
- And eat tiny crackers!
- And drink.

204
00:09:44,753 --> 00:09:47,130
Well, according to the ironmonger
at the bar,

205
00:09:47,255 --> 00:09:50,633
for 20 shillings, I can get a bottle
of wine and a strumpet.

206
00:09:50,717 --> 00:09:52,844
Also, Henslowe and his goons
just arrived,

207
00:09:52,927 --> 00:09:54,095
and they're right over there.

208
00:09:55,096 --> 00:09:56,936
Yeah,
I can see the ring on his hand.

209
00:09:57,432 --> 00:09:59,032
I doubt he's gonna give it up so easily.

210
00:09:59,434 --> 00:10:00,435
Ah, that's simple.

211
00:10:00,518 --> 00:10:03,605
You distract the goons,
and I'll punch the producer in the face.

212
00:10:04,856 --> 00:10:06,191
Anyone got 20 shillings?

213
00:10:06,357 --> 00:10:08,318
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

214
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:10,320
This mission has to be epic. Okay?

215
00:10:10,612 --> 00:10:14,616
By which I mean, extremely well
and elaborately coordinated.

216
00:10:15,283 --> 00:10:16,283
Ray's right.

217
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:19,662
And I have the perfect plan.

218
00:10:20,955 --> 00:10:23,166
<i>We have the element of surprise
on our side,</i>

219
00:10:23,249 --> 00:10:25,335
<i>so I say, aerial attack.</i>

220
00:10:25,418 --> 00:10:27,837
<i>I'll rappel down
while he's totally distracted.</i>

221
00:10:27,921 --> 00:10:29,923
<i>Love it.
And then I'll rappel next to Nate.</i>

222
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:33,802
And then we'll high-five mid-air,
and it will be epic.

223
00:10:35,053 --> 00:10:37,680
And then... Wait. Ray, are you crying?

224
00:10:38,681 --> 00:10:40,391
It's just that I love this plan.

225
00:10:40,475 --> 00:10:41,577
No. Yeah, man, I get it.

226
00:10:41,601 --> 00:10:43,311
I'm a little choked up.
It's a great plan.

227
00:10:44,062 --> 00:10:46,898
<i>And then we'll land behind Henslowe
to his total surprise.</i>

228
00:10:49,275 --> 00:10:50,944
<i>You'll subdue him,
and I'll grab the ring.</i>

229
00:10:51,069 --> 00:10:52,320
Ha! Got it.

230
00:10:52,403 --> 00:10:56,074
Then Behrad will air-blast Henslowe's
thugs with a killer gust of wind.

231
00:10:57,325 --> 00:10:59,202
Dude, I don't dance like that.

232
00:10:59,285 --> 00:11:02,705
And then Constantine will emerge
from the shadows, per uje.

233
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:08,586
Spout some nonsense, and cast a spell
on any troublemakers

234
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,296
<i>to make them think that they're animals.</i>

235
00:11:12,632 --> 00:11:14,759
<i>And then we go to Star City.</i>

236
00:11:14,843 --> 00:11:16,511
We pick up Wild Dog and we...

237
00:11:16,594 --> 00:11:19,305
Oi. Story time's over. I got it.

238
00:11:20,348 --> 00:11:22,016
How the hell did you do that?

239
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,411
What, I just nicked it off his hand
while you lot were prattling on.

240
00:11:24,435 --> 00:11:25,937
Does that mean the mission is over?

241
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,982
Which is why we should get moving,
find that next Loom piece, yeah?

242
00:11:29,065 --> 00:11:31,526
And it's time for you to go, Haircut.

243
00:11:32,277 --> 00:11:33,278
Ray, where are you going?

244
00:11:35,196 --> 00:11:37,031
On... on my honeymoon.

245
00:11:37,115 --> 00:11:40,994
Nora and I are going
to Bermuda... Bahamas.

246
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:44,205
Shut up! You're doing
the whole "Kokomo" package?

247
00:11:44,289 --> 00:11:45,599
Bro, you're gonna be gone for weeks.

248
00:11:45,623 --> 00:11:47,542
I didn't even throw you
a proper bachelor party.

249
00:11:48,126 --> 00:11:50,295
The mission isn't officially over

250
00:11:50,378 --> 00:11:51,897
until we bring the ring back
to the ship, right?

251
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:54,048
Which is where
we should be going right now.

252
00:11:54,173 --> 00:11:56,801
- Come on, let's go.
- Ray! You're not going anywhere.

253
00:11:56,885 --> 00:11:58,845
Grab your doublet and your ruff,

254
00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:03,224
because this bachelor party
is gonna be an Elizabethan extravaganza!

255
00:12:04,309 --> 00:12:05,786
You know, the other thing
about book club is,

256
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:08,370
it can help you figure out what
your true path is supposed to be.

257
00:12:08,396 --> 00:12:09,606
Oh, so this is a cult.

258
00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:10,875
No, no, no.

259
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:13,860
We don't... We don't use certain
"C" words. "Cult," "clone."

260
00:12:13,943 --> 00:12:16,696
I would know,
because book club helped me

261
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:18,948
move forward after my time
in a real cult.

262
00:12:19,032 --> 00:12:20,575
Look, I get your reservations.

263
00:12:20,658 --> 00:12:24,120
The last "club" I joined programmed me
to be an assassin.

264
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:26,456
But book club,
it's helping me be a real person.

265
00:12:26,539 --> 00:12:28,458
And I'd killed a federal agent.

266
00:12:28,917 --> 00:12:34,005
I meant to lead with, I'm a Kaupe.
It's like a Hawaiian Werewolf.

267
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,840
Book club helped me cope with that.

268
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:38,468
That's also a lot to... Okay.

269
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:41,387
So what do you think, Zari?
Can book club help you?

270
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:46,684
You know what? Enough about me.

271
00:12:46,768 --> 00:12:48,686
This is Nora's last book club.

272
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:52,732
Shouldn't we be throwing her
a belated bachelorette bash?

273
00:12:53,734 --> 00:12:56,694
- Yes!
- That's what I'm saying, right?

274
00:12:56,778 --> 00:12:58,780
Captain, I have
an incoming transmission.

275
00:12:58,863 --> 00:13:00,382
- The boys.
- Let's get a fireman.

276
00:13:00,406 --> 00:13:01,449
- Shh!
- What?

277
00:13:02,283 --> 00:13:04,386
<i>Hey, Sara. Sorry that the mission
is taking so long.</i>

278
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:08,122
It's just that a dog took the ring,
and it turned out to be the, um...

279
00:13:08,206 --> 00:13:11,960
You know, the Queen's dog.
But we got it covered. We're good.

280
00:13:12,043 --> 00:13:15,880
Well, great then.
Uh, keep us posted, and be safe.

281
00:13:16,047 --> 00:13:17,047
Copy that.

282
00:13:18,049 --> 00:13:20,134
Fill them up! She bought it.

283
00:13:22,178 --> 00:13:24,222
All right, the boys
are gonna be a while.

284
00:13:24,305 --> 00:13:27,100
So pop that champagne and fill her up!

285
00:13:30,061 --> 00:13:33,940
I noticed John Constantine
is walking topside.

286
00:13:34,315 --> 00:13:36,943
Plans changed. I needed leverage.

287
00:13:37,485 --> 00:13:39,153
John is working for me now.

288
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:40,780
He promised me something.

289
00:13:41,614 --> 00:13:45,118
What exactly is John Constantine
doing for you, Astra?

290
00:13:45,451 --> 00:13:48,955
He said something
about some powerful artifact,

291
00:13:49,038 --> 00:13:51,833
whatever it is,
that can bring my mom back.

292
00:13:53,793 --> 00:13:57,171
I'd have a family again.

293
00:13:59,549 --> 00:14:00,549
So...

294
00:14:02,093 --> 00:14:05,680
John makes this grand promise
to bring your family back,

295
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:07,140
and you quickly forget...

296
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,477
that I'm the one who found you
roaming the streets as a child.

297
00:14:11,561 --> 00:14:13,604
I'm the one who pulled you
from the gutter.

298
00:14:13,688 --> 00:14:16,566
- I raised you...
- No! No, I haven't forgotten.

299
00:14:17,025 --> 00:14:20,486
Then did it occur to you,
if John brings your mother back,

300
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,572
I will no longer be in your life.

301
00:14:23,781 --> 00:14:24,866
You know I don't want that.

302
00:14:25,658 --> 00:14:28,036
You are my family.

303
00:14:29,495 --> 00:14:31,914
If there's a way
to discover what he's after,

304
00:14:31,998 --> 00:14:33,708
maybe you could get it for yourself.

305
00:14:36,085 --> 00:14:37,920
I know a way we can find out.

306
00:14:40,757 --> 00:14:43,843
This is an <i>exspiravit</i> ritual.

307
00:14:44,761 --> 00:14:47,180
It will allow you to see the other side.

308
00:14:48,181 --> 00:14:51,976
You'll be among those on Earth,
able to spy on John like a ghost.

309
00:14:53,061 --> 00:14:54,145
You sure you're ready?

310
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,361
Fill it up.

311
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:20,755
Go on, Ray. Say a few words.

312
00:15:21,214 --> 00:15:23,841
- Speech! Speech!
- Speech! Speech!

313
00:15:24,342 --> 00:15:28,971
Um, I just wanna say... thank you
for this bachelor party.

314
00:15:29,055 --> 00:15:31,724
You're the best friend a guy could have.

315
00:15:31,808 --> 00:15:36,062
- No, no. Because you are!
- You are!

316
00:15:36,145 --> 00:15:40,358
Is there anything else
you'd like to say, Ray?

317
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:41,984
Mmm-mmm.

318
00:15:42,068 --> 00:15:46,114
Anyone have any big life changes
that they wanna reveal?

319
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:50,283
I got a kid.

320
00:15:50,493 --> 00:15:51,493
You what?

321
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:53,579
I've been trying to ignore her, but I...

322
00:15:54,747 --> 00:15:56,082
can't stop thinking about her.

323
00:15:56,499 --> 00:15:58,626
Aw, it's a good thing, Mick.

324
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,460
It's called love.

325
00:16:01,838 --> 00:16:05,299
Let's keep this share-fest going.
All right, who's next?

326
00:16:35,413 --> 00:16:39,458
Hey, we're a regular old, uh,
Fellowship of the Ring.

327
00:16:39,542 --> 00:16:42,461
Here's to getting to the first piece
of the Loom of Destiny...

328
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:45,590
- Yeah, the Spear of Fate.
- Mmm.

329
00:16:45,673 --> 00:16:47,008
Do you remember the totems?

330
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:48,926
- Mmm.
- The totems.

331
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:49,968
I met Elvis.

332
00:16:49,969 --> 00:16:51,387
I mean, it's the "Loom of Fate."

333
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,558
<i>Once we piece it all together,</i>

334
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:58,060
<i>we rewrite Astra's life...</i>

335
00:16:58,144 --> 00:17:00,396
<i>and I'm telling you,
all this is gonna be worth it.</i>

336
00:17:03,983 --> 00:17:04,984
Who's there?

337
00:17:08,029 --> 00:17:09,405
Charge thee, speak!

338
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:20,541
- Oi! Watch it, you pigeon-livered worm!
- Piss off.

339
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:21,833
You want some?

340
00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:24,837
Hey! Leave him alone.

341
00:17:38,017 --> 00:17:39,393
What the devil?

342
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,485
Yes, B! That was it!

343
00:17:48,778 --> 00:17:49,778
Speak to me!

344
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:52,865
What plane of hell did you surface?

345
00:17:53,491 --> 00:17:54,492
Well, whoever you are,

346
00:17:55,368 --> 00:17:59,664
I'm afraid I must do my duty
and send you back.

347
00:18:01,499 --> 00:18:02,499
<i>Fuge.</i>

348
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,880
Astra!

349
00:18:09,465 --> 00:18:11,717
Astra? Astra.

350
00:18:12,551 --> 00:18:13,551
Oh, no.

351
00:18:16,597 --> 00:18:17,848
Yeah, buddy.

352
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:22,270
Ah! Time for the Atometh
to saveth the dayeth.

353
00:18:26,941 --> 00:18:27,941
Deactivate suit.

354
00:18:29,402 --> 00:18:30,861
Deactivate suit!

355
00:18:32,405 --> 00:18:33,321
Sorry.

356
00:18:33,322 --> 00:18:34,322
Watch out!

357
00:18:37,827 --> 00:18:39,495
Code X-94.

358
00:18:39,578 --> 00:18:40,579
X-94!

359
00:18:40,663 --> 00:18:42,623
Dr. Palmer voice authenticated.

360
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:53,968
Party's over.

361
00:18:53,969 --> 00:18:55,409
Yeah, Jock-o's right about that one.

362
00:18:55,469 --> 00:18:56,512
Zounds!

363
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:58,139
Yeah, we'd better mind-wipe that dude.

364
00:18:58,222 --> 00:19:00,057
I got it.

365
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,640
- Wait, no! It's pointing the wrong way.
- I got it.

366
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:10,526
Well, another Legends' mission perfect.

367
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:12,403
Let's head back to the ship.

368
00:19:16,282 --> 00:19:17,282
Sorry.

369
00:19:26,042 --> 00:19:27,042
Hey!

370
00:19:27,626 --> 00:19:28,836
Turn off the music!

371
00:19:30,463 --> 00:19:31,463
Look at this.

372
00:19:31,714 --> 00:19:33,382
Take a look at that. What is that?

373
00:19:34,008 --> 00:19:35,634
Did something go wrong with the mission?

374
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:36,802
Is that Mick?

375
00:19:36,886 --> 00:19:38,763
What's <i>Romeo v. Juliet?</i>

376
00:19:38,846 --> 00:19:41,557
Shakespeare is writing superhero plays?

377
00:19:42,058 --> 00:19:43,351
Oh, that's gonna be a problem.

378
00:19:49,357 --> 00:19:50,900
I cannot believe you guys!

379
00:19:51,067 --> 00:19:53,444
I put you in charge of the mission,
and you lied to me.

380
00:19:53,611 --> 00:19:55,946
- You... you lied to me!
- Ow.

381
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:58,783
So, why? So why... You could just...
You could go party?

382
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,493
That's what we should have done.

383
00:20:00,576 --> 00:20:03,496
We should have waited for Ray and Nora
to come back from their honeymoon

384
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:06,248
and throw one big party. My bad, buddy.

385
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:09,585
Yeah, and guess what? We're well
on our way to assembling the Loom.

386
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:10,896
Uh, but you're right, Sara.

387
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,756
I really should have insisted
that we come back to the ship sooner.

388
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:16,717
- Yeah.
- "Tybalt draws his sword on Mercutio,

389
00:20:16,801 --> 00:20:18,886
but Mercutio turns to steel!"

390
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:19,969
What?

391
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:23,808
Well, thanks to you guys
and your stupid party,

392
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:25,976
this mission is not over.

393
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,771
"With another swing,
Tybalt stabs Mercutio."

394
00:20:28,854 --> 00:20:29,772
I am hurt.

395
00:20:29,773 --> 00:20:32,109
Why didn't he just steel up again?
Stupid Mercutio.

396
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:35,569
This is the least of our worries.
We need to get out there

397
00:20:35,653 --> 00:20:37,613
- and fix hissory.
- What's that?

398
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:39,573
Histrory. History.

399
00:20:39,657 --> 00:20:41,450
Time! We gotta fix time.

400
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,662
- What?
- Are you sloshed?

401
00:20:45,371 --> 00:20:47,498
Follow-up question.
Why is there glitter on your face?

402
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,572
Uh, looks like your tachyon scrubber
needs to be replaced.

403
00:20:52,128 --> 00:20:53,128
Whatever that means.

404
00:20:55,214 --> 00:20:58,592
Could someone... just see this
fine gentleman out? Thank you.

405
00:20:58,676 --> 00:20:59,927
With pleasure.

406
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,680
Let's go, sexy firefighter.
Go on, get!

407
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:05,599
Ray, can I talk to you, please?

408
00:21:06,392 --> 00:21:07,392
Yeah.

409
00:21:08,477 --> 00:21:09,477
Mmm-hmm.

410
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,859
All right, Ray. What's up?

411
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:17,153
Why haven't you told Nate
that you're leaving?

412
00:21:18,446 --> 00:21:20,990
Because he's my best friend.

413
00:21:22,116 --> 00:21:24,994
And the moment I tell him, then...

414
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:26,744
this all becomes real.

415
00:21:27,163 --> 00:21:30,207
And I know it's my choice, my decision,

416
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,877
but I don't... I don't know
if I'm really ready for it.

417
00:21:34,628 --> 00:21:36,464
You remember when we first
moved on the ship?

418
00:21:37,423 --> 00:21:41,469
We left our entire lives behind us.
We had no idea what to expect.

419
00:21:43,012 --> 00:21:45,055
But because we embraced the change...

420
00:21:45,931 --> 00:21:47,016
We made history.

421
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:49,310
Sure did.

422
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:55,107
Who would have thought
that we would still be here...

423
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:58,611
and that we'd be saying goodbye already?

424
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,696
I'm gonna miss you, Captain Lance.

425
00:22:02,281 --> 00:22:04,366
Don't make me cry.

426
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:07,203
I'm gonna miss you, too, Ray.

427
00:22:08,204 --> 00:22:09,246
A lot.

428
00:22:10,831 --> 00:22:12,458
Come here.

429
00:22:16,921 --> 00:22:18,561
Let's hope the actors
aren't off-book yet.

430
00:22:18,631 --> 00:22:20,942
<i>You have to talk Shakespeare
out of his superhero play.</i>

431
00:22:20,966 --> 00:22:23,135
<i>And make sure you get those scripts.</i>

432
00:22:23,219 --> 00:22:26,514
Back, foul villain! Whoosh!

433
00:22:26,597 --> 00:22:30,935
Take to the skies, brethren!
For tonight, there will be justice.

434
00:22:32,353 --> 00:22:35,272
Behold! What worthy hero faces me?

435
00:22:35,356 --> 00:22:39,485
My face is silver.
Fists like thunder strikes.

436
00:22:39,568 --> 00:22:42,404
We must collect the gems
to save the world,

437
00:22:42,488 --> 00:22:45,199
while learning how to work more
as a team.

438
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:48,327
- Yes.
- Come hither. We have much to discuss.

439
00:22:48,536 --> 00:22:51,539
Wow. And it's still
in iambic pentameter.

440
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,749
Okay, you guys take care of the cast

441
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:55,834
and get the scripts.
I'll talk to Shakespeare.

442
00:22:55,918 --> 00:22:57,086
Copy.

443
00:22:58,671 --> 00:23:00,464
Take to the skies, brethren.

444
00:23:00,548 --> 00:23:02,174
I can't believe
we have to destroy these.

445
00:23:02,258 --> 00:23:03,884
This show has potential.

446
00:23:06,804 --> 00:23:08,973
Hear ye! Hear ye!

447
00:23:09,723 --> 00:23:11,141
So there's been a change of plans.

448
00:23:11,225 --> 00:23:13,686
You guys have been replaced
by <i>Riverdale.</i>

449
00:23:18,107 --> 00:23:19,733
- William Shakespeare?
- Bother me not.

450
00:23:20,109 --> 00:23:21,986
I'm making amendments to my script.

451
00:23:22,111 --> 00:23:23,279
I must elucidate more clearly

452
00:23:23,362 --> 00:23:25,864
what the Steel Man's
takeaway lesson is from the story.

453
00:23:26,365 --> 00:23:28,492
I'm actually here to speak to you
about your new play.

454
00:23:28,993 --> 00:23:29,993
I know you.

455
00:23:30,327 --> 00:23:32,413
You're one of the constables
that asked for the ring,

456
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:34,896
and who caused such a glorious row
with Henslowe and his men.

457
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:37,084
Yes, and now I'm here

458
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:38,586
to say that

459
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:40,337
you cannot put on the show.

460
00:23:41,505 --> 00:23:43,382
But I finally struck inspiration.

461
00:23:43,924 --> 00:23:45,843
Look, I have a plan.

462
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,846
Romeo and Juliet

463
00:23:48,929 --> 00:23:50,347
will form a team,

464
00:23:50,431 --> 00:23:52,349
and I will henceforth
introduce the allies,

465
00:23:52,433 --> 00:23:54,810
Hamlet, Viola, and Puck,

466
00:23:54,893 --> 00:23:57,605
who will join forces
to face Richard III.

467
00:23:58,063 --> 00:23:59,648
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

468
00:23:59,732 --> 00:24:02,776
Now I understand why you've written
this new version of the play.

469
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,588
You don't want
Romeo and Juliet's story to end.

470
00:24:04,612 --> 00:24:05,612
Exactly.

471
00:24:05,613 --> 00:24:08,657
I love the characters,
so why say goodbye?

472
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:11,493
But if you truly love the characters,

473
00:24:11,577 --> 00:24:13,495
don't they deserve a great ending?

474
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:21,211
I've always known
how to finish their story.

475
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:23,130
If I let them go,

476
00:24:24,006 --> 00:24:25,841
I'm unsure what happens next.

477
00:24:28,552 --> 00:24:30,012
I understand, but...

478
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:32,640
endings are necessary for growth.

479
00:24:33,641 --> 00:24:37,353
No matter how painful they may be.

480
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:40,689
You speak quite wisely.

481
00:24:41,273 --> 00:24:43,859
I'm speaking from experience.

482
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,987
I find myself in a similar situation.

483
00:24:48,072 --> 00:24:52,826
When I'm done here, I am leaving my team
for a new adventure,

484
00:24:53,202 --> 00:24:57,247
and ending our journey
has proven more heartbreaking...

485
00:24:58,415 --> 00:24:59,458
than I can bear.

486
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,711
And while
I can't imagine saying goodbye,

487
00:25:03,212 --> 00:25:04,672
I know that I must.

488
00:25:05,756 --> 00:25:06,799
Very well.

489
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,261
I shall do what is needed
for my beloved characters,

490
00:25:11,345 --> 00:25:15,099
give Romeo and Juliet an ending
no one will forget.

491
00:25:20,854 --> 00:25:22,648
All righty.

492
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:24,233
If we did our job right,

493
00:25:24,316 --> 00:25:26,151
this cover should change back

494
00:25:26,235 --> 00:25:29,238
to <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> any second.

495
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:30,948
I know you're leaving, Ray.

496
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:34,618
Yeah, uh, to my honeymoon.

497
00:25:34,702 --> 00:25:36,370
Would you just knock it off?

498
00:25:37,246 --> 00:25:39,164
I know you're leaving the team.

499
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:44,628
Nate, I'm... I'm sorry.

500
00:25:44,712 --> 00:25:46,463
I was gonna tell you sooner.

501
00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:49,508
I swear, but I just...
I didn't know how to do it.

502
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:51,343
Maybe if you had the balls
to say it sooner,

503
00:25:51,427 --> 00:25:54,763
maybe I could have done something
like make us a last-mission playlist

504
00:25:54,847 --> 00:25:56,765
or get us matching T-shirts.

505
00:25:57,141 --> 00:25:59,059
That would have been amazing.

506
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:01,562
But I was waiting
for some perfect moment,

507
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:03,147
which doesn't exist,

508
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:06,108
because I didn't want to upset you.

509
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:07,985
Of course, I'm upset!

510
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:09,713
Today could have been awesome.
It could have been amazing,

511
00:26:09,737 --> 00:26:11,405
but now it's just...

512
00:26:13,157 --> 00:26:14,199
It's just over.

513
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:18,829
Eventually, everything has to change.

514
00:26:18,912 --> 00:26:20,348
Yeah, I know everything
changes eventually.

515
00:26:20,372 --> 00:26:21,558
I didn't think it'd be so soon,

516
00:26:21,582 --> 00:26:23,309
and I didn't think
I'd be the last one to know.

517
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:24,543
Attention, Legends.

518
00:26:24,626 --> 00:26:26,920
There is no record of the play
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i>

519
00:26:27,004 --> 00:26:29,173
in the timeline, which means...

520
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:31,091
Shakespeare didn't put on the play yet.

521
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:33,427
The final mission isn't completed.

522
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,720
We can still go back

523
00:26:34,803 --> 00:26:36,346
and fix history together.

524
00:26:39,099 --> 00:26:41,810
The team has it, Ray. You should go.

525
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:43,353
You're right.

526
00:26:43,437 --> 00:26:46,231
Things change eventually,
so why not start now?

527
00:26:46,774 --> 00:26:48,025
Nate.

528
00:26:49,568 --> 00:26:50,569
Nate!

529
00:26:57,201 --> 00:26:58,535
Willy Shakes,

530
00:26:58,619 --> 00:26:59,828
what's happening?

531
00:26:59,912 --> 00:27:02,331
Spare me your whimsical turns of phrase.

532
00:27:02,414 --> 00:27:03,414
Barkeep,

533
00:27:03,791 --> 00:27:05,751
my draught has gone hollow.
I'll have another.

534
00:27:05,834 --> 00:27:08,712
Will, what happened to the play?

535
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:12,049
Henslowe withdrew the moneys
and shut us down.

536
00:27:12,132 --> 00:27:14,510
In his mind's eye,
he thinks I stole back his ring.

537
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:16,678
Now, I have no theater,

538
00:27:16,762 --> 00:27:19,807
no actors, and so no career.

539
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:22,226
Tell us where Henslowe is.
We'll help you.

540
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:23,894
Just leave me be.

541
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:26,355
I've seen your help in action,
and it is anything but.

542
00:27:26,438 --> 00:27:27,648
So you're just gonna give up?

543
00:27:27,731 --> 00:27:29,358
It's like the tall one said.

544
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,443
All things must cease.

545
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,822
And this is the end
of William Shakespeare.

546
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,784
- He is so dramatic.
- Yeah.

547
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,210
Woah.

548
00:27:50,546 --> 00:27:52,756
- Packed already?
- Yeah.

549
00:27:53,507 --> 00:27:54,758
Figured why wait.

550
00:27:54,842 --> 00:27:56,444
Well, there's no rush.
You know, we can stick around

551
00:27:56,468 --> 00:27:58,011
until they get back.

552
00:27:59,513 --> 00:28:01,265
I think we've stuck around
too long already.

553
00:28:16,655 --> 00:28:17,698
What is going on?

554
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:19,783
Well, we ruined
the Western literary canon,

555
00:28:19,867 --> 00:28:21,118
and Shakespeare hates us,

556
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:23,495
so here's to Legends of Tomorrow,

557
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:27,457
who single-handedly destroyed
storytelling as we know it.

558
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:29,793
Sorry, so that's it?

559
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:33,463
First, you pick a fight with Ray,
and now you admit defeat!

560
00:28:33,547 --> 00:28:36,008
Are you just trying to prove
that everything is as miserable

561
00:28:36,091 --> 00:28:38,051
- as how you feel?
- I don't wanna talk about Ray.

562
00:28:39,011 --> 00:28:41,054
Look, Nate, I get it.

563
00:28:41,138 --> 00:28:43,015
I'm afraid of losing Ray, too.

564
00:28:43,682 --> 00:28:45,350
Honestly, I don't know
what we're gonna do

565
00:28:45,434 --> 00:28:48,770
without his stupid optimism
and blind faith

566
00:28:48,854 --> 00:28:52,190
and ridiculous plans
that somehow always work.

567
00:28:53,901 --> 00:28:55,235
I know what we need to do.

568
00:28:58,155 --> 00:29:01,074
Gideon, tell the team it's
all hands on deck here at the tavern,

569
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:03,577
and fabricate some codpieces.

570
00:29:04,703 --> 00:29:06,163
The show must go on.

571
00:29:13,128 --> 00:29:14,504
All right, it's almost showtime.

572
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:16,840
Remember, Gideon is going to be
feeding you your lines.

573
00:29:16,924 --> 00:29:18,050
Yeah, no pressure.

574
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:20,677
It's not like we're rebooting
Shakespeare's career or anything.

575
00:29:20,761 --> 00:29:22,679
It really is book club's
greatest mission yet.

576
00:29:22,763 --> 00:29:25,015
I can't believe I let you guys
rope me into this one.

577
00:29:25,098 --> 00:29:27,643
Look, if you want to find the Loom,
you gotta do things our way.

578
00:29:27,726 --> 00:29:29,269
You think this is gonna work, Captain?

579
00:29:29,353 --> 00:29:32,230
Honestly, no. But Ray would.

580
00:29:32,773 --> 00:29:35,275
"My bounty is as boundless as the sea."

581
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:37,152
- That's crap.
- Just say the words,

582
00:29:37,235 --> 00:29:39,237
because you are on!

583
00:29:48,163 --> 00:29:50,707
Listen up, you uncultured jerks.

584
00:29:53,126 --> 00:29:55,128
Two households, both alike in dignity,

585
00:29:55,212 --> 00:29:56,421
in fair Verona,

586
00:29:56,505 --> 00:29:58,298
- where we lay our scene.
- What?

587
00:29:58,382 --> 00:29:59,692
From ancient grudge
breaks to new mutiny.

588
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:00,634
What?

589
00:30:00,635 --> 00:30:01,635
Where civil blood...

590
00:30:01,677 --> 00:30:03,595
What? What? Stop.
Those are my words!

591
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,807
...a pair of starstruck lovers
take their life.

592
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,076
Just enjoy the show, all right?

593
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,619
Whose misadventured
piteous overthrows...

594
00:30:09,643 --> 00:30:11,120
- Looks like the audience is.
- ...done to their death.

595
00:30:19,403 --> 00:30:23,365
Clubs, bills, and partisans.

596
00:30:23,949 --> 00:30:27,202
Strike! Beat them down.

597
00:30:27,285 --> 00:30:29,246
Down with the Capulets.

598
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:31,415
Down with the Montagues!

599
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:35,544
What noise is this?

600
00:30:36,712 --> 00:30:38,380
Give me my long sword, ho!

601
00:30:39,214 --> 00:30:42,134
A sword? A crutch!

602
00:30:42,217 --> 00:30:45,178
Why call you for a sword?

603
00:30:45,262 --> 00:30:47,222
My sword, I say!

604
00:30:47,305 --> 00:30:49,433
Old Montague has come,

605
00:30:49,516 --> 00:30:52,060
and flourishes his blade in spite of me.

606
00:30:52,144 --> 00:30:54,396
Thou villain Capulet.

607
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:57,065
Hold me not! Let me go.

608
00:30:57,149 --> 00:31:01,236
Thou shalt not stir one foot
to seek a foe.

609
00:31:10,746 --> 00:31:11,788
Fight.

610
00:31:16,334 --> 00:31:17,335
Exciting.

611
00:31:22,215 --> 00:31:24,718
What shall I swear by?

612
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:26,845
If my heart's dear love...

613
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:28,680
Do not swear.

614
00:31:28,764 --> 00:31:30,348
Although I take joy in thee,

615
00:31:30,432 --> 00:31:32,559
I take no joy in this contract tonight.

616
00:31:32,642 --> 00:31:33,810
It is too rash,

617
00:31:33,894 --> 00:31:36,480
too unadvised, too sudden.

618
00:31:37,689 --> 00:31:39,066
Too rash,

619
00:31:39,149 --> 00:31:42,402
too unadvised,
too sudden.

620
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,660
Too like the lightning,

621
00:31:50,744 --> 00:31:52,162
which doth cease to be.

622
00:31:52,746 --> 00:31:55,290
One can say, it lightens.

623
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:57,709
Sweet, good night.

624
00:32:00,504 --> 00:32:02,064
Oh, uh...

625
00:32:02,089 --> 00:32:05,509
Wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

626
00:32:06,885 --> 00:32:07,885
What's wrong?

627
00:32:07,886 --> 00:32:10,847
I mean, other than the fact this role
clearly should have gone to a woman.

628
00:32:10,931 --> 00:32:13,683
I just need a second, okay?

629
00:32:13,767 --> 00:32:14,976
Acting is hard.

630
00:32:16,353 --> 00:32:17,729
I know it can be hard to face

631
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:20,065
that your time with someone
is coming to an end.

632
00:32:21,066 --> 00:32:22,776
Sometimes, it's easier to just

633
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:27,030
send them away before it hits you.
Like Juliet's doing here.

634
00:32:27,405 --> 00:32:28,657
She got all that?

635
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,492
She was meant for book club.

636
00:32:31,201 --> 00:32:32,744
Change is hard,

637
00:32:32,828 --> 00:32:35,914
but it can also be beautiful.
It can be both.

638
00:32:37,874 --> 00:32:41,044
You know, it's not too late
to say goodbye to your friend.

639
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:45,966
- What about Juliet?
- I have it handled.

640
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:50,720
Among my many talents,

641
00:32:51,096 --> 00:32:53,598
- I'm a classically trained actor.
- Huh.

642
00:32:59,855 --> 00:33:01,606
Gidget, I'm off-book.

643
00:33:06,111 --> 00:33:09,614
This bud of love,
by summer's ripening breath,

644
00:33:09,698 --> 00:33:13,368
may prove a beauteous flower
when next we meet.

645
00:33:13,702 --> 00:33:16,037
Is that a man?

646
00:33:16,121 --> 00:33:17,831
- Good night.
- Does it matter?

647
00:33:17,914 --> 00:33:19,207
Good night.

648
00:33:19,291 --> 00:33:21,626
As sweet repose
and rest come to thy heart

649
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:25,630
- as that within my breast.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

650
00:33:25,714 --> 00:33:28,800
Wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

651
00:33:31,595 --> 00:33:32,888
All right, Gideon.

652
00:33:33,847 --> 00:33:35,182
It's time for me to go.

653
00:33:35,348 --> 00:33:37,434
Will I ever see you again?

654
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:39,060
I hope so.

655
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:41,354
Thank you for everything.

656
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:45,525
And, uh,
take care of the Legends for me.

657
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:47,652
Safe travels, Dr. Palmer.

658
00:33:52,324 --> 00:33:54,701
Ray, are you there? Can you hear me?

659
00:33:55,076 --> 00:33:56,076
Ray.

660
00:33:57,287 --> 00:33:59,998
You... again.

661
00:34:14,429 --> 00:34:16,139
Get over here.

662
00:34:16,223 --> 00:34:17,223
Help.

663
00:34:17,974 --> 00:34:18,975
Ray!

664
00:34:19,768 --> 00:34:23,271
What satisfaction
canst thou have tonight?

665
00:34:23,355 --> 00:34:26,858
The exchange of thy love's
faithful vows for mine.

666
00:34:26,942 --> 00:34:29,527
I gave thee mine
before thou didst request it,

667
00:34:29,611 --> 00:34:31,154
and yet I would it were to give again.

668
00:34:31,238 --> 00:34:33,823
Wouldst thou withdraw it?
For what purpose, love?

669
00:34:35,242 --> 00:34:37,869
But to be frank, and give it thee again.

670
00:34:40,372 --> 00:34:43,458
<i>And yet I wish
but for the thing I have...</i>

671
00:34:46,962 --> 00:34:49,422
<i>my bounty is as boundless as the sea.</i>

672
00:34:50,298 --> 00:34:51,925
<i>My love as deep.</i>

673
00:34:52,634 --> 00:34:54,511
The more I give to thee,

674
00:34:55,178 --> 00:34:58,640
the more I have, for both are infinite.

675
00:35:05,355 --> 00:35:07,607
I hear some noise within.

676
00:35:07,691 --> 00:35:09,651
Dear love, adieu.

677
00:35:11,569 --> 00:35:13,780
Ray! Ray! Ray!

678
00:35:19,911 --> 00:35:20,911
I missed him.

679
00:35:22,998 --> 00:35:24,249
He's gone.

680
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:26,126
Nate. Nate!

681
00:35:26,751 --> 00:35:28,128
I'm still here, buddy.

682
00:35:29,379 --> 00:35:31,298
Romeo. Romeo.

683
00:35:33,258 --> 00:35:36,052
Ray, I am so sorry I lashed out at you.

684
00:35:36,136 --> 00:35:39,180
It was just a lot to process,
and I didn't know how to say it.

685
00:35:40,223 --> 00:35:42,058
The thing is, I'm just really sad...

686
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:46,229
but I'm really happy for you guys.

687
00:35:49,733 --> 00:35:52,235
I'm sorry that you found out
the way you did...

688
00:35:53,903 --> 00:35:56,489
and that just... I wish there was
some way that everything

689
00:35:56,573 --> 00:36:00,368
and nothing could change all at once.

690
00:36:16,509 --> 00:36:17,552
This sucks.

691
00:36:19,846 --> 00:36:21,097
But I love you.

692
00:36:24,851 --> 00:36:26,394
This totally sucks.

693
00:36:28,146 --> 00:36:29,439
But I love you, too.

694
00:36:33,068 --> 00:36:34,110
<i>Good night.</i>

695
00:36:34,277 --> 00:36:35,320
<i>Good night.</i>

696
00:36:36,029 --> 00:36:37,781
<i>Parting is such sweet sorrow</i>

697
00:36:37,864 --> 00:36:40,992
that I shall say good night
till it be morrow.

698
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:45,120
Aw.

699
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:08,186
Zari was pretty good at Juliet.

700
00:37:08,269 --> 00:37:10,188
I mean, not as good as you, but...

701
00:37:17,153 --> 00:37:18,405
You okay?

702
00:37:19,072 --> 00:37:20,698
It's a weird thing with friendship.

703
00:37:21,616 --> 00:37:23,284
It starts because you need each other.

704
00:37:24,327 --> 00:37:26,079
And then, if you do it right

705
00:37:26,162 --> 00:37:27,956
and help each other grow,

706
00:37:28,039 --> 00:37:30,208
you need each other less.

707
00:37:30,291 --> 00:37:32,419
I guess change is the whole point.

708
00:37:32,502 --> 00:37:35,964
Well, if you, um...
If you ever need a bro hug...

709
00:37:38,133 --> 00:37:39,133
I'm your gal.

710
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:42,095
Bring it in.

711
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,100
Sorry.

712
00:37:48,726 --> 00:37:49,811
It's okay.

713
00:37:49,894 --> 00:37:52,397
Ray was terrible
at bro hugs at first, too.

714
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,732
- Yeah.
- But you're really terrible.

715
00:37:55,316 --> 00:37:56,901
You're such a dick.

716
00:37:57,527 --> 00:37:58,778
Why are you so strong?

717
00:38:02,365 --> 00:38:03,658
On a Shakespeare kick?

718
00:38:03,741 --> 00:38:05,660
Didn't care much for those Italian kids,

719
00:38:05,743 --> 00:38:06,828
but, this guy...

720
00:38:07,287 --> 00:38:08,580
This guy is a hero.

721
00:38:08,663 --> 00:38:11,541
You know King Lear is a tragic figure

722
00:38:11,624 --> 00:38:13,626
whose stubbornness
and fear of the future

723
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:15,295
leads to his own misery?

724
00:38:15,378 --> 00:38:17,338
Sounds like someone I can get behind.

725
00:38:17,672 --> 00:38:19,007
You should talk to your daughter.

726
00:38:20,216 --> 00:38:22,010
There's no secrets in book club.

727
00:38:25,346 --> 00:38:26,639
I'm not hiding from her.

728
00:38:26,723 --> 00:38:29,225
- I'm protecting her.
- From what?

729
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,817
Nurturing fathers
don't run in my family.

730
00:38:38,526 --> 00:38:41,404
But I'm better off
because I had you in my life.

731
00:38:42,113 --> 00:38:43,364
She will be, too.

732
00:38:46,117 --> 00:38:47,327
It's good to see you.

733
00:38:48,536 --> 00:38:50,288
Consent to hug you?

734
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,541
Gonna take that as a yes.

735
00:39:00,965 --> 00:39:03,218
So this is part of the Loom of Fate?

736
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,179
Well, I had to disguise the bit
so that mere mortals like you

737
00:39:06,262 --> 00:39:07,990
wouldn't burst into flames
when you looked at it.

738
00:39:08,014 --> 00:39:10,892
That is certainly
very thoughtful of you, Charlie.

739
00:39:12,143 --> 00:39:13,770
Not so fast.

740
00:39:14,187 --> 00:39:16,606
This is too powerful, John,
and, honestly,

741
00:39:16,689 --> 00:39:17,774
you're too close to it.

742
00:39:17,857 --> 00:39:19,651
You know, this is my mission, Sara.

743
00:39:20,235 --> 00:39:21,694
And this is my ship.

744
00:39:22,111 --> 00:39:24,364
- So what's the plan?
- This is just the beginning.

745
00:39:24,447 --> 00:39:27,700
But with that,
we can find the other pieces.

746
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:38,378
I was so worried.

747
00:39:38,461 --> 00:39:40,588
I wasn't sure when you'd wake up.

748
00:39:41,047 --> 00:39:42,298
What did you see?

749
00:39:43,299 --> 00:39:46,177
I... I was in a bar...

750
00:39:46,427 --> 00:39:48,096
and people were...

751
00:39:49,472 --> 00:39:51,391
laughing, and...

752
00:39:51,474 --> 00:39:53,768
And John was there with his friends.

753
00:39:53,851 --> 00:39:55,395
Did he say what he was looking for?

754
00:39:58,189 --> 00:40:00,733
He's looking for the Loom of Fate.

755
00:40:03,486 --> 00:40:04,444
The Loom?

756
00:40:04,445 --> 00:40:07,198
- So you've heard of it?
- Of course.

757
00:40:07,865 --> 00:40:12,120
The Loom of Fate is one
of the most powerful tools in existence.

758
00:40:12,203 --> 00:40:14,956
It could completely rewrite your life.

759
00:40:16,082 --> 00:40:19,586
Are you sure you want to trust
that power in someone else's hands?

760
00:40:20,461 --> 00:40:23,381
Especially John Constantine's?

761
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:35,310
- Can't sleep either, huh?
- Yeah.

762
00:40:36,644 --> 00:40:39,147
You know,
we all spend time off the ship,

763
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,649
but people usually don't feel this,
uh...

764
00:40:41,733 --> 00:40:43,359
- Gone.
- ...gone.

765
00:40:43,443 --> 00:40:46,154
How early does a guy have to get up
to get some alone time?

766
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:50,366
Ray's green juice.
You feeling sentimental too, huh, Mick?

767
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:53,202
The juice was taking up
all the room in the fridge.

768
00:40:53,286 --> 00:40:54,495
Now shut up, pretty.

769
00:40:54,954 --> 00:40:58,041
Missing someone after they're gone
almost makes them more present.

770
00:40:58,499 --> 00:40:59,834
Heard you get up, babe.

771
00:41:00,668 --> 00:41:02,629
- I was awake anyway.
- Hi, babe.

772
00:41:02,712 --> 00:41:05,006
I had a feeling other people
would be up.

773
00:41:05,089 --> 00:41:07,050
Oh, gross! Is that Ray's green juice?

774
00:41:07,133 --> 00:41:08,676
- Yep.
- Give me some.

775
00:41:20,396 --> 00:41:21,439
To Ray...

776
00:41:22,357 --> 00:41:24,317
who taught me how to be a better friend

777
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,569
by being a better friend
than I deserved.

778
00:41:26,861 --> 00:41:29,656
Who told me that, if you're dumb enough
to expect good from the world,

779
00:41:29,739 --> 00:41:31,908
well, it might just live up
to your expectations.

780
00:41:32,575 --> 00:41:36,079
And who showed us
that there's never a problem so big

781
00:41:36,162 --> 00:41:38,247
it can't be solved with a smile.

782
00:41:39,415 --> 00:41:40,500
To the big guy.

783
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:41,501
- To Ray.
- To Ray.

784
00:41:41,502 --> 00:41:42,502
To Ray.

785
00:41:42,919 --> 00:41:44,671
I'm really gonna miss him.

786
00:41:47,048 --> 00:41:48,132
Tastes like death.

787
00:41:48,216 --> 00:41:49,300
It's delicious.

788
00:41:52,845 --> 00:41:55,139
You think Ray left
that bathroom sign-up sheet?

789
00:41:58,267 --> 00:42:00,645
No, no, no!
