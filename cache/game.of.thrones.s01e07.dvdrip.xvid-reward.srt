1
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:48,960
(Fanfare)

2
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:50,960
(Crow caws)

3
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:53,080
(Man yells)

4
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,120
(Horse neighs)
(Man shouting)

5
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:00,360
''Summoned to court
to answer for the crimes

6
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:04,440
''of your bannerman Gregor Clegane,
the Mountain.'' Er...

7
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,000
''Arrive within the fortnight
or be branded an enemy of the crown.''

8
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:11,680
Poor Ned Stark.

9
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,200
Brave man, terrible judgment.

10
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,160
Attacking him was stupid.

11
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:27,000
(Grunts)

12
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,400
Lannisters...

13
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,920
don't act like fools.

14
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,640
Are you going to say something clever?

15
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,360
Go on, say something clever.

16
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:49,200
Catelyn Stark took my brother.

17
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:55,520
- Why is he still alive?
- Tyrion?

18
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,200
Ned Stark.

19
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,960
One of our men interfered,

20
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,200
speared him through the leg
before l could finish him.

21
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,280
Why is he still alive?

22
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,320
lt wouldn't have been clean.

23
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,800
Clean.

24
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,960
You spend too much time worrying
about what other people think of you.

25
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,000
l could care less
what anyone thinks of me.

26
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,040
That's what you want
people to think of you.

27
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,320
lt's the truth.

28
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:26,080
When you hear them whispering
''kingslayer'' behind your back,

29
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:28,080
doesn't it bother you?

30
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:32,240
Of course it bothers me.

31
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,160
A lion doesn't concern himself

32
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,160
with the opinions of the sheep.

33
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,120
l suppose l should be grateful
that your vanity

34
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,200
got in the way
of your recklessness.

35
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,240
l'm giving you half of our forces -

36
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,680
30,OOO men.

37
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,360
You will bring them to Catelyn Stark's
girlhood home

38
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:55,760
and remind her that Lannisters

39
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,720
pay their debts.

40
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:01,800
l didn't realise you placed such
a high value on my brother's life.

41
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:04,240
He's a Lannister.

42
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,560
He might be the lowest of the Lannisters,
but he's one of us.

43
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,000
And every day that he remains a prisoner,

44
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,880
the less our name commands respect.

45
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,960
So the lion does concern himself
with the opinions of...

46
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,400
No, that's not an opinion. It's a fact.

47
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,160
lf another house
can seize one of our own

48
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,760
and hold him captive with impunity,

49
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:27,040
we are no longer a house to be feared.

50
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,400
Your mother's dead.

51
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:35,520
Before long l'll be dead.

52
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:37,360
And you...

53
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,560
and your brother
and your sister

54
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:41,120
and all of her children.

55
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,320
All of us dead,
all of us rotting in the ground.

56
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,720
lt's the family name that lives on.

57
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:51,120
lt's all that lives on.

58
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,160
Not your personal glory,
not your honour,

59
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:56,040
but family.

60
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,120
Do you understand?

61
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,920
Hmm.

62
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,400
You're blessed with abilities
that few men possess.

63
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:17,480
You're blessed to belong to the most
powerful family in the Kingdoms.

64
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,280
And you're still blessed with youth.

65
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:23,640
And what have you done
with these blessings, huh?

66
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:27,080
You've served as a glorified
bodyguard for two kings -

67
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,520
one a madman,
the other a drunk.

68
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,160
The future of our family will be determined
in these next few months.

69
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:43,160
We could establish a dynasty
that will last a thousand years.

70
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,520
Or we could collapse into nothing,
as the Targaryens did.

71
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:52,960
l need you to become the man
you were always meant to be.

72
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:57,080
Not next year. Not tomorrow.

73
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,680
Now.

74
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:20,680
(Bell tolling)

75
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,400
You're in pain.

76
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,120
l've had worse, my lady.

77
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:39,360
Perhaps it's time to go home.

78
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,200
The South doesn't seem
to agree with you.

79
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,680
l know the truth Jon Arryn died for.

80
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,560
Do you, Lord Stark?

81
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:50,000
ls that why you called me here,
to pose me riddles?

82
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:53,400
Has he done this before?

83
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:59,640
Jaime would have killed him.
My brother is worth a thousand of your friend.

84
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,280
Your brother...

85
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:02,640
or your lover?

86
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:09,760
The Targaryens wed brothers
and sisters for 300 years

87
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:12,280
to keep bloodlines pure.

88
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,360
Jaime and l are more
than brother and sister.

89
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,520
We shared a womb.

90
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,360
We came into this world together.
We belong together.

91
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,240
My son saw you with him.

92
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,880
Do you love your children?

93
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,800
- With all my heart.
- No more than l love mine.

94
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,920
- And they're all Jaime's.
- (Chuckles) Thank the gods.

95
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,440
ln the rare event that Robert leaves his whores
for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed,

96
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,280
l finish him om in other ways.

97
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:43,000
- In the morning, he doesn't remember.
- You've always hated him.

98
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,160
Hated him? l worshipped him.

99
00:07:46,279 --> 00:07:50,800
Every girl in the Seven Kingdoms dreamed
of him, but he was mine by oath.

100
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,680
And when l finally saw him
on our wedding day in the Sept of Baelor,

101
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,440
lean and fierce and black-bearded,

102
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,640
it was the happiest moment of my life.

103
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:02,400
That night he crawled on top of me,
stinking of wine,

104
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:05,240
and did what he did,
what little he could do,

105
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,320
and whispered in my ear, ''Lyanna.''

106
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:13,560
Your sister was a corpse
and l was a living girl

107
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,600
and he loved her more than me.

108
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,920
When the king returns from his hunt,
l'll tell him the truth.

109
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,120
You must be gone by then -
you and your children.

110
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,800
l will not have
their blood on my hands.

111
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,240
Go as far away as you can,

112
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,480
with as many men as you can.

113
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,840
Because wherever you go,

114
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,120
Robert's wrath will follow you.

115
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,840
And what of my wrath, Lord Stark?

116
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,120
You should have taken the realm for yourself.

117
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,960
Jaime told me about the day
King's Landing fell.

118
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,760
He was sitting in the Iron Throne
and you made him give it up.

119
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:49,120
All you needed to do
was climb the steps yourself.

120
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,800
Such a sad mistake.

121
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:54,280
l've made many mistakes in my life...

122
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,840
but that wasn't one of them.

123
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,440
Oh, but it was.

124
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:01,640
When you play the game of thrones,
you win.. .

125
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,120
or you die.

126
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,000
There is no middle ground.

127
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,720
- (Children laughing)
- Come here.

128
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,680
(Children crying)

129
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,000
(Dog barking)

130
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,320
(Woman moaning)

131
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,240
Oh, yes! Oh, yes!

132
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,360
(Woman laughs and moans)

133
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,360
Oh!

134
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:42,200
Oh, yes! Oh! Oh!

135
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:46,120
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Oh!

136
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:49,680
Oh, yes! Oh, yes!

137
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,200
Oh!

138
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,040
No, no, no, no!

139
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:58,280
ls that what they teach you
up in the North?

140
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,920
And you -
wherever you're from -

141
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,800
do you have any idea
how ridiculous you sound?

142
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:10,080
Either of you understand
a thing that l'm saying?

143
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,760
Yes, my lord.

144
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:15,040
Let's start over, shall we?

145
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,440
You be the man...

146
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:20,440
and you be the woman.

147
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:26,080
Well, go ahead.

148
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:30,520
Slowly.

149
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,720
(Soft moaning)

150
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:41,560
You're not fooling them.
They just paid you.

151
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,960
They know what you are.

152
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:46,080
They know it's all just an act.

153
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,840
Your job is to make them
forget what they know.

154
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,960
Now, that takes time.

155
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:53,680
You need to...

156
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:55,600
ease into it.

157
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:59,600
Go ahead.

158
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,240
Ease into it.

159
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,320
He's winning you over
in spite of yourself.

160
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,160
You're starting to like this.

161
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,040
He wants to believe you.

162
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,920
He's enjoyed his cock since he was old
enough to play with it. Why shouldn't you?

163
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:26,080
He knows he's better
than other men.

164
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,480
He's always known it deep down inside.
Now he has proof.

165
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,000
He's so good,

166
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,640
he's reaching something deep inside of you
that no one even knew was there,

167
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:39,240
overcoming your very nature.

168
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,400
Why don't you join us, my lord?

169
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:46,880
l'm saving myself for another.

170
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:49,400
What she doesn't know won't hurt her.

171
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,440
- A stupid saying.
- (Moans)

172
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:54,440
What we don't know is usually
what gets us killed.

173
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:55,840
(Moans)

174
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,800
She must be very beautiful.

175
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:01,440
No, not really.
Impeccable bloodlines though.

176
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,440
l do believe my lord's in love.

177
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:06,800
For many years.
Most of my life, really.

178
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:08,080
Play with her arse.

179
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,240
And she loved me too.

180
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:14,600
l was her little confidant, her plaything.

181
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,560
She could tell me anything,
anything at all.

182
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:21,360
She told me about all the horses
that she liked,

183
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,680
the castle that she wanted to live in

184
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:26,560
and the man that she wanted to marry -

185
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,800
a Northerner...
with a jaw like an anvil.

186
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:32,920
- (Moaning)
- So l challenged him to a duel.

187
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:35,720
l mean, why not?
l'd read all the stories.

188
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:39,360
The little hero always beats
the big villain in all the stories.

189
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,720
ln the end,
she wouldn't even let him kill me.

190
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:46,160
''He's just a boy,'' she said.

191
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:48,120
''Please don't hurt him.''

192
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,760
So he gave me a nice little scar
to remember him by, and om they went.

193
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:54,520
ls she still married to him?

194
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,440
Oh, no. He got himself killed
before the wedding...

195
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:59,360
(Gasping loudly)

196
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,080
..and she ended up with his brother,
an even more impressive specimen.

197
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,680
She loves him, l'm afraid.

198
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:09,200
And why wouldn't she?
l mean, who could compare to him?

199
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,440
- He's just so...
- (Shrieks and moans)

200
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:13,240
(Moaning)
(Laughs)

201
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,800
(Moaning, sighing)

202
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,640
..good.

203
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,440
Do you know what l learned,
Iosing that duel?

204
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:27,600
l learned that l'll never win, not that way.

205
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,520
That's their game,

206
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:32,080
their rules.

207
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,080
l'm not going to fight them.

208
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,240
l'm going to fuck them.
That's what l know.

209
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,400
That's what l am.

210
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,240
And only by admitting what we are
can we get what we want.

211
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,520
And what do you want?

212
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:48,080
Oh, everything, my dear.

213
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,920
Everything there is.

214
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:56,680
Now wash yourselves.
Both of you are working tonight.

215
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,400
Hmm.

216
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:19,720
(Footsteps)

217
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:28,840
You're a very lucky girl.
Do you know that?

218
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:35,360
Where l come from,
we don't show mercy to criminals.

219
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,000
Where l come from,
if someone like you attacked a little lord...

220
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,240
at low tide we'd lay you
on your back on the beach,

221
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,120
your hands and feet
chained to four stakes.

222
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,640
The sea would come in
closer and closer.

223
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,200
You'd see death creeping towards you
a few inches at a time.

224
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,160
Where is it you come from?

225
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,280
The Iron Islands.

226
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:58,400
They far away?

227
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:00,800
You've never heard of the Iron Islands?

228
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:04,400
Trust me, you've never heard
where l'm from neither.

229
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,720
''Trust me, my lord.''

230
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,640
You're not living in the wilderness anymore.

231
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:14,920
ln civilised lands,
you refer to your betters

232
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:17,040
by their proper titles.

233
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:19,680
- And what's that?
- Lord.

234
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:21,560
Why?

235
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,200
Why?

236
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,160
What do you mean, why?

237
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:29,360
My father is Balon Greyjoy,
Lord of the Iron Islands.

238
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,000
What's that got to do with you?

239
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,840
lf your father's lord,

240
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,760
how can you be lord too?

241
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:40,160
- l will be lord after my father.
- So you're not lord now?

242
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:42,040
No, you...

243
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:46,720
Are you having a go at me?
Is that it?

244
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,520
l just don't understand
how you southerners do things.

245
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:52,760
- l'm not a southerner.
- You're from south of the Wall.

246
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,800
That makes you a southerner to me.

247
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,560
You're an impudent little wench, aren't you?

248
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:03,320
Couldn't say, my lord.

249
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,280
Don't know what ''impunent'' means.

250
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,200
lmpudent.

251
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,520
lt means rude, disrespectful.

252
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:16,560
Do you want to lose that chain?

253
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,760
Theon Greyjoy!

254
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:23,200
The lady is our guest.

255
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,120
l thought she was our prisoner.

256
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,720
Are the two mutually exclusive
in your experience?

257
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,600
Chances are l won't be nearby
the next time that happens.

258
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,400
l'm used to worse than him.

259
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,480
Hmm?

260
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,200
l'm used to men who could
chew that boy up

261
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,640
and pick their teeth with his bones.

262
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,240
(Chuckles)

263
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,920
Why did you come here?

264
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,920
Didn't mean to come here.

265
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:01,800
Meant to get much further south than this.

266
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:04,680
As far south as south goes,

267
00:17:04,759 --> 00:17:06,840
before the long night comes.

268
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,560
Why? What are you afraid of?

269
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:14,600
There's things that sleep in the day
and hunt at night.

270
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:19,080
- Owls and shadowcats...
- l'm not talking about owls and shadowcats.

271
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,400
The things you speak of -

272
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,880
they've been gone
for thousands of years.

273
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,760
They wasn't gone, old man.

274
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:33,520
They was sleeping.

275
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,000
And they ain't sleeping no more.

276
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:48,160
(Samwell) l miss girls.

277
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:50,880
Not even talking to them.
l never talked to them.

278
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:54,360
Just looking at them,

279
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:55,920
hearing them giggle.

280
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,320
Don't you miss girls?

281
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:09,320
Riders.

282
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:12,640
The horn.
We have to blow the horn.

283
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,840
Why is he alone?

284
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,000
One blast for a ranger returning,

285
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:21,840
two for wildlings,

286
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,960
- three for...
- There's no rider.

287
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,280
(Creaking)

288
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,920
(Neighs, snorts)

289
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:53,640
(Neighs)

290
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:56,840
- (Neighs)
- Whoa, boy, whoa.

291
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,920
That's my Uncle Benjen's horse.

292
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,240
(Neighing continues)

293
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,640
Where's my uncle?

294
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,160
Ned!

295
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,760
lt's Robert.
We were hunting...

296
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,600
a boar...

297
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,480
(Robert) l should have
spent more time with you,

298
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,200
shown you how to be a man.

299
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,800
l was never meant to be a father.

300
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,280
Go on.

301
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,400
You don't want to see this.

302
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,960
My fault.

303
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:20,280
Too much wine,
missed my thrust.

304
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:31,320
(Robert) It stinks.

305
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,480
lt stinks like death.

306
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:37,280
Don't think l can't smell it.

307
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,440
(Robert laughs)

308
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,520
l paid the bastard back, Ned.

309
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,800
l drove my knife
right through his brain.

310
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:48,240
You ask 'em if l didn't. Ask 'em!

311
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:54,040
l want the funeral feast to be
the biggest the Kingdoms ever saw.

312
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,520
And l want everyone
to taste the boar that got me.

313
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:05,200
Now leave us, the lot of you.
l need to talk to Ned.

314
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,360
- Robert, my sweet...
- Out, all of you!

315
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,520
(Coughing)

316
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:30,120
You damned fool.

317
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,280
Paper and ink on the table.

318
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,560
Write down what l say.

319
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:45,720
''ln the name of Robert
of the House Baratheon,

320
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:46,920
''first of...''

321
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,520
You know how it goes.

322
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,080
Fill in the damn titles.

323
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,160
''l hereby command

324
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:55,920

00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:58,400
titles, titles...

326
00:21:58,519 --> 00:22:01,800
''to serve as Lord Regent
and Protector of the Realm

327
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,960
''upon my death,

328
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:06,880
''to rule in my stead

329
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,400
''until my son Joffrey comes of age.''

330
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,600
Give it over.

331
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:45,600
Give it to the council...

332
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,240
after l'm dead.

333
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,560
At least they'll say l did this right,

334
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,960
this one thing.

335
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,760
You'll rule now.

336
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:58,480
You'll hate it worse than l did...

337
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:01,440
but you'll do it well.

338
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,120
The girl...

339
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,720
Daenerys.

340
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:13,520
You were right.
Varys, Littlefinger,

341
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,400
my brother... worthless.

342
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:18,680
No one to tell me ''no'' but you.

343
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,040
Only you.

344
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,920
Let her live.

345
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,120
Stop it, if it's not too late.

346
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,840
l will.

347
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,160
And my son...

348
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,560
help him, Ned.

349
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,880
Make him better than me.

350
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:43,840
l'll...

351
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,440
l'll do everything l can
to honour your memory.

352
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:50,720
My memory. (Laughs, coughs)

353
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,360
King Robert Baratheon,

354
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,560
murdered by a pig.

355
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,360
(Wheezes, coughs)

356
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,480
Give me something for the pain
and let me die.

357
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,640
Give him milk of the poppy.

358
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,280
He was reeling from the wine.

359
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,920
(Door closes)

360
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,920
He commanded us to...

361
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,280
step aside, but...

362
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,400
l failed him.

363
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,200
No man could have
protected him from himself.

364
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:46,880
l wonder, Ser Barristan,

365
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,680
who gave the king this wine?

366
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,640
His squire,
from the king's own skin.

367
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:56,280
His squire? The Lannister boy?

368
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:59,400
Such a dutiful boy
to make sure His Grace

369
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:01,840
did not lack refreshment.

370
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:05,280
l do hope the poor lad
does not blame himself.

371
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,520
His Grace has had a change of heart
concerning Daenerys Targaryen.

372
00:25:18,599 --> 00:25:21,160
Whatever arrangements you made...

373
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:24,560
unmake them. At once.

374
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,840
l'm afraid those birds have flown.

375
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,880
The girl is likely dead already.

376
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:44,680
The stallion who mounts
the world has no need for iron chairs.

377
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,280
According to the prophecy...

378
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,720
...the stallion will ride
to the ends of the earth.

379
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:51,280
The earth ends at the black salt sea.

380
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,240
No horse can cross the poison water.

381
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,400
The earth does not end at the sea...

382
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:57,760
...there are many dirts beyond the sea.

383
00:25:57,839 --> 00:26:00,080
The dirt where l was born.

384
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:05,480
Not dirts. Lands.

385
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:07,800
Lands, yes...

386
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:11,520
There are thousands of ships
in the free cities.

387
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,520
Wooden horses that fly across the sea...

388
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:17,160
Let's speak no more of wooden horses
and iron chairs.

389
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,920
lt's not a chair. It's a...

390
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,040
(Speaks English) ..throne.

391
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,520
(Speaks English) Throne.

392
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,680
A chair for a King to sit upon,

393
00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:33,360
Or...

394
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,080
...a Queen.

395
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:41,600
(He groans)

396
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:45,520
A King does not need a chair to sit upon.

397
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,320
He only needs a horse.

398
00:26:59,359 --> 00:27:01,640
(Chatter, music, traders calling)

399
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,720
Can't you help me
make him understand?

400
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:12,360
The Dothraki do things in their own time,
for their own reasons.

401
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,880
Have patience, Khaleesi.
We will go home, l promise you.

402
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,000
My brother was a fool, l know,

403
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:20,560
but he was the rightful heir
to the Seven Kingdoms.

404
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,120
(Chuckles)

405
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,920
Have l said something funny, ser?

406
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:26,840
Forgive me, Khaleesi,
but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror

407
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,360
didn't seize six of the Kingdoms
because they were his right.

408
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,200
He had no right to them.
He seized them because he could.

409
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:33,680
And because he had dragons.

410
00:27:33,799 --> 00:27:36,440
Ah, well, having a few dragons
makes things easier.

411
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,200
- You don't believe it.
- Have you ever seen a dragon, Khaleesi?

412
00:27:41,319 --> 00:27:44,000
l believe what my eyes
and ears report.

413
00:27:44,119 --> 00:27:46,600
As for the rest...
it was 300 years ago.

414
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,360
Who knows what really happened?

415
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,680
Now if you'll pardon me,
l'll seek out the merchant captain,

416
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,400
see if he has any letters for me.

417
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:55,120
- l'll come with you.
- No, no, don't trouble yourself.

418
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:58,000
Enjoy the market.
l'll rejoin you soon enough.

419
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:08,400
Psst! Jorah the Andal.

420
00:28:10,599 --> 00:28:12,560
The Spider sends his greetings

421
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,680
and his congratulations.

422
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,440
A royal pardon.
You can go home now.

423
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:30,640
(Merchant calling in Dothraki)

424
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,920
Sweet reds...

425
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:41,360
l have sweet reds from Lys,
Volantis and the Arbor!

426
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:44,080
Tyroshi pear brandy! Andalish sours!

427
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,480
l have them! l have them!

428
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,960
A taste for the Khaleesi?

429
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,840
l have a sweet red from Dorne, my lady.

430
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:55,560
One taste and you'll
name your first child after me.

431
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,520
(Speaks English) My son already has
his name, but l'll try your summeM/ine.

432
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:02,800
Just a taste.

433
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,800
My lady, you are from Westeros.

434
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,720
You have the honour of addressing Daenerys
of the House Targaryen,

435
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,760
Khaleesi of the Riding Men
and Princess of the Seven Kingdoms.

436
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,760
- Princess.
- Rise.

437
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,800
l'd still like to taste that wine.

438
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,000
That? Dornish swill.

439
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,400
Not worthy of a princess.

440
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:25,680
l have a dry red from the Arbor -

441
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:27,640
nectar of the gods.

442
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:30,320
Let me give you a cask.
A... A gift.

443
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,840
You honour me, ser.

444
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,240
The honour...
the honour is all mine.

445
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:36,080
(Man) Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.

446
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,680
You know, there are many in your homeland
that pray for your return, Princess.

447
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:44,360
l hope to repay
your kindness someday.

448
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,800
Rakharo.

449
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,840
Put down that cask.

450
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,040
- Is something wrong?
- l have a thirst.

451
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:53,920
Open it.

452
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,480
The wine is for the khaleesi.
It's not for the likes of you.

453
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,800
Open it.

454
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,440
Pour.

455
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,480
lt would be a crime
to drink a wine this rich

456
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:15,480
- without at least giving it time to breathe.
- Do as he says.

457
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,040
As the princess commands.

458
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,960
Sweet, isn't it?

459
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:34,160
Can you smell the fruit, ser?

460
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,160
Taste it, my lord.

461
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,960
Tell me that that is not the finest wine
that has ever touched your tongue.

462
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:45,480
You first.

463
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,400
Me?

464
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:51,840
l'm afraid l am not worthy of the vintage.

465
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:55,280
Besides, it is a poor wine merchant
who would drink up his own wares.

466
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,040
You will drink.

467
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,600
(Grunting, shouting)

468
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,800
Stop him!

469
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,520
(Grunts)

470
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:25,240
(Men shouting)

471
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:27,240
(Growls)

472
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:29,360
Come.

473
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,880
(Spits)

474
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,040
- You came to us as outlaws...
- (Thunder)

475
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:42,160
..poachers, rapers,

476
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:44,240
killers, thieves.

477
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,840
You came alone, in chains,

478
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,560
without friends

479
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,720
or honour.

480
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:55,120
You came to us rich
and you came to us poor.

481
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,520
- (Thunder)
- Some of you bear the names

482
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,440
of proud Houses,

483
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,080
others only bastard names
or no names at all.

484
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,880
lt does not matter.

485
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,880
All that is in the past.

486
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,840
Here...

487
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,800
on the Wall...

488
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,200
we are all one House.

489
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,440
- Tonight...
- You're allowed to look happy.

490
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,160
You're going to be a ranger.

491
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,320
lsn't that what you always wanted?

492
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,720
l want to find my uncle.

493
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:31,880
l know he's alive out there.
l know he is.

494
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,720
l wish l could help you,
but l'm no ranger.

495
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:38,720
lt's the steward's life for me.

496
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:41,720
There's honour in being a steward.

497
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,120
Not much, really.

498
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,640
But there's food.

499
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:53,200
Here...you begin anew.

500
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,800
A man of the Night's Watch...

501
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,120
lives his life for the realm.

502
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,400
Not for a king...

503
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:13,200
or a lord, or the honour of this House

504
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:15,560
or that House,

505
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,320
not for gold or glory,

506
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,680
or a woman's love,

507
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,680
but for the realm

508
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,360
and all the people in it.

509
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,800
You've all learned
the words of the vow.

510
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,760
Think carefully before you say them.

511
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,560
The penalty for desertion...

512
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,920
is death.

513
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,400
You can take your vows here...

514
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,160
tonight...

515
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:47,520
at sunset.

516
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,720
Do any of you still keep the old gods?

517
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:54,680
l do, my lord.

518
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:58,040
You'll want to take your vow
before a heart tree as your uncle did.

519
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,160
Yes, my lord.

520
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,040
You'll find a weiM/ood
a mile north of the Wall.

521
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,840
And your old gods too, maybe.

522
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,760
My lord, might l go as well?

523
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,680
Does House Tarly keep the old gods?

524
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,960
No, my lord.

525
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,520
l was named in the light of the Seven,

526
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:18,040
as my father was
and his father before him.

527
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,880
Why would you forsake the gods
of your father and your House?

528
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,960
The Night's Watch is my House now.

529
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,480
The Seven have never answered my prayers.

530
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,760
Perhaps the old gods will.

531
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:34,480
As you wish, lad.

532
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,280
You've all been assigned an order,

533
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,080
according to our needs

534
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,800
and your strengths.

535
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,680
Halder to the builders.

536
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,280
Pyp to the stewards.

537
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,120
Toad to the builders.
Grenn to the rangers.

538
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,080
Samwell to the stewards.

539
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,600
Matthar to the rangers.
Dareon to the stewards.

540
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,600
Balian to the rangers.

541
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,200
Rast to the rangers.

542
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,800
Jon to the stewards.

543
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,560
Rancer to the builder.

544
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:06,440
Echiel to the builders.
Gordo to the stewards.

545
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:09,760
Niko to the rangers.
Escan to the rangers.

546
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,760
Vorkoy to the builders.
Joby to the stables.

547
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,960
Mink to the kitchens.
Allo to the builders.

548
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,280
Nelugo to the rangers.

549
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,760
May all the gods preserve you.

550
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,760
Rangers with me.

551
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:31,280
Builders!

552
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:53,880
Samwell, you will assist me
in the rookery and library.

553
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,760
Pyp, you will report
to Bowen Marsh in the kitchens.

554
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:02,360
Luke, report to One-Eyed Joe
in the stables.

555
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,200
Dareon, we are sending you
to Eastwatch.

556
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,960
Present yourself to Borcas
when you arrive.

557
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:12,080
Make no comment about his nose.

558
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:16,200
Jon Snow,
Lord Commander Mormont

559
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,120
has requested you
for his personal steward.

560
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:23,680
Will l serve the Lord Commander's meals
and fetch hot water for his bath?

561
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,360
Certainly. And keep a fire burning
in his chambers,

562
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,200
change his sheets
and blankets daily

563
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,800
and do everything else
the Lord Commander requires of you.

564
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,200
Do you take me for a servant?

565
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,760
We took you for a man
of the Night's Watch.

566
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,560
But perhaps we were wrong in that.

567
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:47,080
- May l go?
- As you wish.

568
00:36:52,679 --> 00:36:56,440
Jon, wait! Don't you see
what they're doing?

569
00:36:56,559 --> 00:36:58,360
l see Ser Alliser's revenge, that's all.

570
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,200
He wanted it and he got it.

571
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,640
Stewards are nothing but maids!

572
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,720
l'm a better swordsman
and rider than any of you!

573
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,720
- It's not fair.
- Fair?

574
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,640
l was singing for a high lord
at Acorn Hall

575
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,560
when he put his hand on my leg
and he wanted to see my cock.

576
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:17,320
l pushed him away and he said he'd have
my hands cut om for stealing their silver.

577
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,160
So now l'm here -
at the end of the world

578
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,920
with no one to sing for
but old men and little shits like you.

579
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:23,840
l'll never see my family again.

580
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,960
l'll never be inside a woman again.

581
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,200
So don't tell me about fair.

582
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,920
l thought you were caught stealing
a wheel of cheese for your starving sister.

583
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:34,960
Think l was gonna tell a bunch of strangers
that a high lord tried to grab my cock?

584
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:40,840
Could you sing me a song, Pyp?
l'd like to hear a song.

585
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:47,360
Now listen to me.

586
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,600
The old man is the Lord Commander
of the Night's Watch.

587
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,440
You'll be with him day and night.

588
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:54,920
Yes, you'll clean his clothes.

589
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,720
But you'll also take his letters,
attend him at meetings,

590
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,600
squire for him in battle.

591
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:04,200
You'll know everything,
be part of everything.

592
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,800
And he asked for you himself.

593
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,480
He wants to groom you for command.

594
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,960
l just...

595
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:18,880
l always wanted to be a ranger.

596
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:22,960
l always wanted to be a wizard.

597
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,160
- (Laughs)
- What?

598
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,400
No, l'm serious.

599
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:31,960
So you'll stay
and say your words with me?

600
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:41,400
Lord Stark...a moment.

601
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:44,480
Alone, if you will.

602
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,640
He named you Protector of the Realm.

603
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,760
He did.

604
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,440
She won't care.

605
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:03,840
Give me an hour and l can put
a hundred swords at your command.

606
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,640
And what should l do
with a hundred swords?

607
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:09,440
Strike! Tonight, while the castle sleeps.

608
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,840
We must get Joffrey away from his mother
and into our custody.

609
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,600
Protector of the Realm or no,
he who holds the king holds the kingdom.

610
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:20,600
Every moment you delay gives Cersei
another moment to prepare.

611
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:23,480
By the time Robert dies,
it will be too late for the both of us.

612
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,280
What about Stannis?

613
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,480
Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei
and delivering them to Stannis?

614
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:31,200
You have odd notions
about protecting the realm.

615
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,840
Stannis is your older brother.

616
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,000
This isn't about the bloody
line of succession.

617
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:39,040
That didn't matter when you rebelled
against the Mad King. It shouldn't matter now.

618
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,960
What's best for the Kingdoms?

619
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:45,840
What's best for the people we rule?

620
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,360
We all know what Stannis is.

621
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,600
He inspires no love or loyalty.

622
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:54,320
He's not a king.

623
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:56,920
l am.

624
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,200
Stannis is a commander.

625
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:08,280
He's led men into war twice.

626
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,040
He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet.

627
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:12,840
Yes, he's a good soldier.
Everyone knows that. So was Robert.

628
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:15,160
Tell me something.

629
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,560
Do you still believe good soldiers
make good kings?

630
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:27,600
l will not dishonour Robert's last hours
by shedding blood in his halls...

631
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:30,040
and dragging frightened children
from their beds.

632
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:45,720
You will sail to Dragonstone tonight.

633
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,320
You will place this in the hand
of Stannis Baratheon.

634
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,640
Not his steward...

635
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:54,920
not his captain of the guard...

636
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:57,240
and not his wife.

637
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,640
Only Stannis himself.

638
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,520
- (Knocking)
- Yes, my lord.

639
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,080
Now leave us.

640
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:21,400
My Lord Protector.

641
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,720
The king has no trueborn sons.

642
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:31,200
Joffrey and Tommen...

643
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,120
are Jaime Lannister's bastards.

644
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:38,400
- So when the king dies...
- The throne passes to his brother...

645
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,240
Lord Stannis.

646
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:43,440
So it would seem.

647
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:47,360
- Unless...
- There is no ''unless''.

648
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:49,720
He is the rightful heir.
Nothing can change that.

649
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,800
And he cannot take the throne
without your help.

650
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,760
You would be wise to deny it to him
and to make sure Joffrey succeeds.

651
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:01,240
Do you have a shred of honour?

652
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:04,960
You are now Hand of the King
and Protector of the Realm.

653
00:42:05,079 --> 00:42:07,200
All of the power is yours.
You need only...

654
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,720
reach out and take it.

655
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,800
Make peace with the Lannisters.

656
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,240
Release the Imp.
Wed your daughter to Joffrey.

657
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:17,920
We've plenty of time to get rid of Stannis,

658
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,320
and if Joffrey seems likely to cause problems
when he comes into his throne,

659
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,600
we simply reveal his little secret

660
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:26,720
- and seat Lord Renly there instead.
- We?

661
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:30,440
You'll need someone to share these burdens,
l assure you.

662
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:32,520
My price would be modest.

663
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,520
What you suggest is treason.

664
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:37,640
Only if we lose.

665
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:42,760
Make peace with the Lannisters,
you say.. .

666
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:46,240
with the people who tried to murder my boy.

667
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:49,640
We only make peace
with our enemies, my lord.

668
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,880
That's why it's called ''making peace''.

669
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,080
No. l won't do it.

670
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:57,600
So it will be Stannis and war?

671
00:42:57,679 --> 00:42:59,800
There is no other choice.

672
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:02,200
He is the heir.

673
00:43:03,159 --> 00:43:04,680
So why did you call me here?

674
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,760
Not for my wisdom, clearly.

675
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,320
You promised Catelyn
you would help me.

676
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,120
The queen has a dozen knights
and a hundred men-at-arms -

677
00:43:13,239 --> 00:43:16,920
enough to oveM/helm what remains
of my household guard.

678
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,760
l need the gold cloaks.

679
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:21,920
The City Watch is 2,OOO strong...

680
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:25,040
and sworn to defend the king's peace.

681
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:29,320
Look at you.

682
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,360
You know what you want me to do,

683
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,400
you know it has to be done,

684
00:43:34,519 --> 00:43:36,520
but it's not honourable, so...

685
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:38,920
the words stick in your throat.

686
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:41,920
When the queen proclaims one king

687
00:43:42,039 --> 00:43:43,680
and the Hand proclaims another,

688
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,360
whose peace do the gold cloaks protect?

689
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,800
Who do they follow?

690
00:43:54,679 --> 00:43:56,440
The man who pays them.

691
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,240
(Rumbling, chains rattling)

692
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,160
(Thud)

693
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:05,320
(Rumbling, chains rattling)

694
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:10,480
(Barking)

695
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:13,320
(Wind whistling)

696
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,240
(Thunder)

697
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:44,160
(Jon and Samwell) Hear my words
and bear witness to my vow.

698
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,560
Night gathers
and now my watch begins.

699
00:44:47,639 --> 00:44:50,720
lt shall not end until my death.

700
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,000
l shall take no wife,

701
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,960
hold no lands,
father no children.

702
00:44:56,519 --> 00:45:00,000
l shall wear no crowns
and win no glory.

703
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:03,600
l shall live and die at my post.

704
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:06,480
l am the sword in the darkness.

705
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:09,120
l am the watcher on the walls.

706
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,000
l am the shield that guards
the realms of men.

707
00:45:13,159 --> 00:45:16,800
l pledge my life and honour
to the Night's Watch,

708
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:20,600
for this night
and all the nights to come.

709
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,760
You knelt as boys.

710
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,240
Rise now as men of the Night's Watch.

711
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:39,760
Well done. Well done.

712
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,160
What's he got there?

713
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:51,160
To me, Ghost.
Bring it here.

714
00:45:53,239 --> 00:45:55,480
Gods be good!

715
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,720
What will they do to him?

716
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:08,960
When the khalasar rides,
he'll be leashed to a saddle

717
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:12,480
and forced to run behind the horses
for as long as he can.

718
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:14,360
And when he falls?

719
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:18,360
l saw a man last nine miles once.

720
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,080
King Robert still wants me dead.

721
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:24,360
This poisoner was the first.
He won't be the last.

722
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,160
l thought he'd leave me alone
now that my brother is gone.

723
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,800
He will never leave you alone.

724
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,080
lf you ride to darkest Asshai,
his assassins will follow you.

725
00:46:34,199 --> 00:46:36,520
lf you sailed all the way
to the Basilisk Isles,

726
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:37,840
his spies would tell him.

727
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,840
He will never abandon the hunt.

728
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,680
You're a Targaryen -
the last Targaryen.

729
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,760
Your son will have Targaryen blood

730
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,320
with 40,OOO riders behind him.

731
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,560
He will not have my son.

732
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:55,400
He will not have you either, Khaleesi.

733
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:18,240
(Whimpering)

734
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:28,840
Moon of my life.

735
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:30,840
Are you hurt?

736
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,760
Jorah the Andal,

737
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,520
l heard what you did.

738
00:47:45,639 --> 00:47:49,040
Choose any horse you wish, it is yours.

739
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,880
l make this gift to you.

740
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:06,680
And to my son,
the stallion who will mount the world,

741
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:10,120
l will also pledge a gift.

742
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:14,240
l will give him the iron chair...

743
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:18,200
...that his mother's father sat upon.

744
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,880
l will give him Seven Kingdoms.

745
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,760
l, Drogo, will do this.

746
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,480
l will take my Khalasar west
to where the world ends...

747
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:36,840
...and ride wooden horses
across the black salt water...

748
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,320
- ...as no Khal has done before.
- (Men cheering)

749
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:46,760
l will kill the men in iron suits...

750
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,760
- ...and tear down their stone houses.
- (Cheering)

751
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:55,680
- l will rape their women...
- (Cheering)

752
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:58,200
...take their children as slaves...

753
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:01,320
...and bring their broken gods
back to Vaes Dothrak.

754
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,560
(Shouting and cheering)

755
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:07,040
This, l vow...

756
00:49:07,159 --> 00:49:09,960
... l, Drogo, son of Bharbo.

757
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:11,360
(Cheering)

758
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:16,080
l swear before the Mother of Mountains...

759
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:17,960
...as the stars look down in witness.

760
00:49:19,639 --> 00:49:22,400
As the stars look down in witness.

761
00:49:22,519 --> 00:49:24,400
(Roaring and cheering)

762
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:46,720
(Grunts)

763
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:52,240
Lord Stark!

764
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:54,160
- Stop!
- (Ned) No, all right.

765
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:56,040
lt's all right.
Let him through.

766
00:49:56,119 --> 00:49:59,640
Lord Stark, King Joffrey and the Queen Regent
request your presence in the Throne Room.

767
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,440
King Joffrey?

768
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:02,960
King Robert is gone.

769
00:50:03,079 --> 00:50:05,160
The gods give him rest.

770
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:10,000
(Bells tolling)

771
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,640
All is accomplished.
The City Watch is yours.

772
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,360
Good.

773
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:23,040
ls Lord Renly joining us?

774
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,360
l fear Lord Renly has left the city.

775
00:50:28,119 --> 00:50:31,240
He rode through the Old Gate
an hour before dawn

776
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:35,080
with Ser Loras Tyrell
and some 50 retainers.

777
00:50:35,239 --> 00:50:38,560
Last seen galloping south
in some haste.

778
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,000
(Ned sighs)

779
00:50:58,559 --> 00:51:00,520
We stand behind you, Lord Stark.

780
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,240
(Steward) All hail His Grace,

781
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:14,080
Joffrey of Houses Baratheon
and Lannister

782
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:15,760
the First of His Name,

783
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:18,000
King of the Andals and the First Men,

784
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:20,280
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms

785
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:23,360
and Protector of the Realm.

786
00:51:40,599 --> 00:51:44,280
l command the council to make all necessary
arrangements for my coronation.

787
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,880
l wish to be crowned within the fortnight.

788
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,680
Today l shall accept oaths of fealty

789
00:51:49,800 --> 00:51:51,600
from my loyal councillors.

790
00:51:55,239 --> 00:51:56,640
Ser Barristan...

791
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:00,120
l believe no man here
could ever question your honour.

792
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,280
King Robert's seal - unbroken.

793
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:24,760
''Lord Eddard Stark is herein named...

794
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:26,600
''Protector of the Realm...

795
00:52:27,719 --> 00:52:29,520
''to rule as regent...

796
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:32,160
''until the heir come of age.''

797
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:35,440
May l see that letter, Ser Barristan?

798
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:45,160
Protector of the Realm.

799
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:52,000
ls this meant to be your shield, Lord Stark?

800
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:54,560
A piece of paper?

801
00:52:57,639 --> 00:53:00,520
- Those were the king's words.
- We have a new king now.

802
00:53:03,159 --> 00:53:06,240
Lord Eddard, when we last spoke
you omered me some counsel.

803
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,480
Allow me to return the courtesy.

804
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:11,680
Bend the knee, my lord.

805
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,600
Bend the knee
and swear loyalty to my son...

806
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,760
and we shall allow you
to live out your days

807
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:20,400
in the grey waste you call home.

808
00:53:20,519 --> 00:53:22,640
Your son has no claim to the throne.

809
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:23,920
- (Snorts)
- Liar!

810
00:53:24,039 --> 00:53:26,800
You condemn yourself
with your own mouth, Lord Stark.

811
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:28,680
Ser Barristan, seize this traitor.

812
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:33,240
Ser Barristan is a good man,
a loyal man. Do him no harm.

813
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,080
You think he stands alone?

814
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:43,200
Kill him! Kill all of them!
l command it!

815
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:47,200
Commander!
Take the queen and her children into custody.

816
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:51,280
Escort them back to the royal apartments
and keep them there, under guard.

817
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,120
Men of the Watch!

818
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:59,360
l want no bloodshed.

819
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:01,880
Tell your men to lay down their swords.

820
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,880
No one needs to die.

821
00:54:05,639 --> 00:54:07,560
(Commander) Now!

822
00:54:17,679 --> 00:54:20,200
l did warn you not to trust me.
