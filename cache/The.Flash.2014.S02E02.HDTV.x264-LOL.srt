1
00:00:01,635 --> 00:00:02,868
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,904
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:06,076 --> 00:00:09,110
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,

4
00:00:09,112 --> 00:00:12,113
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

5
00:00:12,115 --> 00:00:15,717
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

6
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:17,686
I hunted down the man who killed my mother,

7
00:00:17,688 --> 00:00:21,256
but in doing so, I opened
up our world to new threats.

8
00:00:21,258 --> 00:00:24,426
And I am the only one
fast enough to stop them.

9
00:00:24,428 --> 00:00:27,529
I am The Flash.

10
00:00:27,691 --> 00:00:30,325
Previously on The Flash...

11
00:00:30,327 --> 00:00:31,526
No!

12
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:33,294
The man who saved Central City.

13
00:00:33,296 --> 00:00:34,729
Why did you want to kill me?

14
00:00:34,731 --> 00:00:36,898
- He promised he'd take me home.
- Who?

15
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,401
- Zoom.
- Wells killed my mother.

16
00:00:39,403 --> 00:00:40,702
I don't know anything anymore,

17
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:42,370
especially who I can and can't trust.

18
00:00:42,372 --> 00:00:44,205
S.T.A.R. Labs is now safer than ever.

19
00:00:44,207 --> 00:00:46,141
People can't just waltz in and out of here.

20
00:00:46,143 --> 00:00:48,043
Exactly.

21
00:00:48,045 --> 00:00:51,112
- Stay where you are.
- My name is Jay Garrick.

22
00:00:51,214 --> 00:00:53,681
Your world is in danger, Barry Allen.

23
00:00:54,785 --> 00:00:56,484
Please, just let me explain.

24
00:00:56,486 --> 00:00:58,153
I mean you no harm.

25
00:00:58,155 --> 00:00:59,420
How do you know my name?

26
00:00:59,422 --> 00:01:01,823
I know all your names. Caitlin Snow,

27
00:01:01,825 --> 00:01:03,925
Cisco Ramon, Detective Joe West...

28
00:01:03,927 --> 00:01:05,627
Enough.

29
00:01:05,629 --> 00:01:07,562
That part about explaining
needs to happen right about now.

30
00:01:07,564 --> 00:01:09,330
This world is in danger.

31
00:01:09,332 --> 00:01:11,499
What other worlds are there?

32
00:01:11,501 --> 00:01:13,668
When you created the
singularity above Central City,

33
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,038
you also created a breach
between my world and yours.

34
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,873
I'm sorry, a breach?

35
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:21,242
Yes, a portal connecting our two earths.

36
00:01:21,244 --> 00:01:23,678
And what precisely is your concern?

37
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,549
A few days ago, you found a dead man
named Al Rothstein at the nuclear plant.

38
00:01:27,951 --> 00:01:29,417
But then a different Al
Rothstein tried to kill you.

39
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:31,139
Atom Smasher.

40
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:32,473
That man was from my world.

41
00:01:32,475 --> 00:01:33,875
If he got through the breach,

42
00:01:33,877 --> 00:01:35,443
I suspect there'll be more to follow.

43
00:01:35,445 --> 00:01:38,649
Okay, so, Jay, how exactly
do you know all of this?

44
00:01:41,651 --> 00:01:44,886
Where I came from, I
was a speedster like you.

45
00:01:44,888 --> 00:01:47,388
They called me The Flash.

46
00:01:50,327 --> 00:01:54,362
- synced and corrected by chamallow -

47
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,197
Before I arrived on your earth,

48
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:59,968
I was in a fight with a man named Zoom.

49
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,894
Zoom?

50
00:02:02,896 --> 00:02:05,063
I've heard that name before.

51
00:02:05,065 --> 00:02:08,834
Atom Smasher, he said Zoom
sent him here to kill me.

52
00:02:09,636 --> 00:02:10,902
Who is this guy?

53
00:02:10,904 --> 00:02:12,537
He's a speedster, like you and me.

54
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:14,972
And fast. Maybe the fastest of all.

55
00:02:14,974 --> 00:02:16,507
But evil.

56
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:19,844
He is an unstoppable demon
with the face of death.

57
00:02:23,216 --> 00:02:26,117
We were engaged in our
fiercest battle ever,

58
00:02:26,119 --> 00:02:27,952
racing throughout my city.

59
00:02:27,954 --> 00:02:29,320
But I wasn't fast enough to stop him.

60
00:02:29,322 --> 00:02:32,457
Zoom had me beaten.

61
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:33,624
Aah!

62
00:02:33,626 --> 00:02:35,026
He was about to kill me

63
00:02:35,028 --> 00:02:36,794
when suddenly there was a blinding light

64
00:02:36,796 --> 00:02:39,197
and the sky split open.

65
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:41,532
A breach, between my world and yours,

66
00:02:41,534 --> 00:02:44,635
caused from the singularity.

67
00:02:44,637 --> 00:02:46,137
It pulled me in...

68
00:02:51,344 --> 00:02:54,545
And I somehow ended up in your world.

69
00:02:54,547 --> 00:02:56,948
Powerless. Unable to return home.

70
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,249
What do you mean?

71
00:02:58,251 --> 00:02:59,984
I lost my speed.

72
00:02:59,986 --> 00:03:00,952
How?

73
00:03:00,954 --> 00:03:04,121
Not entirely sure.

74
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:08,526
So, you've been in Central
City for six months.

75
00:03:08,528 --> 00:03:10,061
Why haven't you come to see us before?

76
00:03:10,063 --> 00:03:11,896
I'm in a foreign world here, Detective.

77
00:03:11,898 --> 00:03:13,397
I didn't know who you all were.

78
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:15,833
Took me that long to piece it all together.

79
00:03:15,835 --> 00:03:17,602
So that's how you know our names.

80
00:03:17,604 --> 00:03:19,737
You've been following us.

81
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,241
Look, I know how this sounds.

82
00:03:23,243 --> 00:03:25,042
The existence of another earth,

83
00:03:25,044 --> 00:03:26,978
you, another Flash,

84
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:30,948
it all came as an
unexpected shock to me, too.

85
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,618
I just wish there was something
I could do to convince you.

86
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:35,019
There is.

87
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:38,823
We're gonna... do some tests on you.

88
00:03:38,825 --> 00:03:41,125
See if you're telling us the truth.

89
00:03:41,127 --> 00:03:45,596
'Cause if you're not, this Zoom,

90
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:49,300
he's not gonna be your only enemy.

91
00:03:58,978 --> 00:04:00,645
Where the hell am I?

92
00:04:00,647 --> 00:04:02,246
You want to go home?

93
00:04:02,248 --> 00:04:04,849
You only have to do one thing.

94
00:04:04,851 --> 00:04:05,850
What's that?

95
00:04:05,852 --> 00:04:08,252
Kill The Flash.

96
00:04:11,824 --> 00:04:14,125
So, Mr. Garrick,

97
00:04:14,127 --> 00:04:16,594
how long have you been
The Flash on your world?

98
00:04:16,596 --> 00:04:19,330
Not long enough to call me Mister.

99
00:04:19,332 --> 00:04:20,564
Please, it's Jay.

100
00:04:20,566 --> 00:04:21,866
Jay, of course.

101
00:04:21,868 --> 00:04:24,635
On my world, I've been The
Flash for about two years.

102
00:04:24,637 --> 00:04:27,038
And how did you get your speed?

103
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,106
Not really sure. I was at my lab

104
00:04:29,108 --> 00:04:32,076
trying to purify heavy water
without any residual radiation

105
00:04:32,078 --> 00:04:33,911
when there was a blinding light.

106
00:04:33,913 --> 00:04:36,314
I fell into a coma. When I woke up,

107
00:04:36,316 --> 00:04:39,016
I could run almost as
fast as the speed of light.

108
00:04:39,018 --> 00:04:41,719
Sorry. Did you say lab?

109
00:04:41,721 --> 00:04:43,421
Are you a scientist?

110
00:04:43,423 --> 00:04:44,955
Well, I certainly didn't
work at a place like this,

111
00:04:44,957 --> 00:04:46,257
but, yeah.

112
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,759
I had a respectable solo operation.

113
00:04:48,761 --> 00:04:50,895
Part-time chemist, part-time physicist.

114
00:04:50,897 --> 00:04:52,997
- Part-time superhero.
- Hmm.

115
00:04:52,999 --> 00:04:56,967
I can forget that superhero
part now, though, huh?

116
00:04:56,969 --> 00:04:58,436
Is any of this possible?

117
00:04:58,438 --> 00:05:00,338
A breach to another earth? It's not, right?

118
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,605
The contrary. Just recently,

119
00:05:01,607 --> 00:05:04,308
the many-different-worlds
theory proposed interaction

120
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,310
with parallel universes was plausible.

121
00:05:06,312 --> 00:05:08,312
Now, if what Mr. Garrick's saying is true,

122
00:05:08,314 --> 00:05:10,581
that theory's been proven
sooner than we all thought.

123
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:11,749
It doesn't add up.

124
00:05:11,751 --> 00:05:13,017
I'm gonna be honest here,

125
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:14,285
I don't understand what the hell

126
00:05:14,287 --> 00:05:15,753
any of you are talking about.

127
00:05:15,755 --> 00:05:18,055
So, Jay is saying he's from,

128
00:05:18,057 --> 00:05:20,257
like, a mirror-world.

129
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:22,159
Or a parallel universe

130
00:05:22,161 --> 00:05:24,528
that's very, very similar to ours.

131
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:27,965
Multiverse would be a more apt description.

132
00:05:27,967 --> 00:05:30,701
- No, not helping.
- Bless your heart.

133
00:05:30,703 --> 00:05:33,371
Okay, let's see if this helps.

134
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:38,275
This is our earth.

135
00:05:38,277 --> 00:05:42,113
Let's call it Earth-1.

136
00:05:42,115 --> 00:05:45,118
And this second Earth,
let's call it Earth-2.

137
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,987
This is where Jay claims to be from.

138
00:05:49,989 --> 00:05:53,325
And these other earths, three, four, five,

139
00:05:54,227 --> 00:05:57,896
to infinity, all of them,
are nearly identical to ours.

140
00:05:58,498 --> 00:06:01,399
And they all exist at the same time,

141
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:04,702
giving us endless alternatives
to what we have here.

142
00:06:04,704 --> 00:06:09,006
For example, the Joe West on
Earth-2, your doppelganger,

143
00:06:09,008 --> 00:06:10,408
he might not be a detective.

144
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:13,043
He could be a Nobel
Prize-winning physicist.

145
00:06:13,045 --> 00:06:16,614
And you, the Barry Allen here is The Flash,

146
00:06:16,616 --> 00:06:20,117
but over there, he could be an electrician.

147
00:06:20,119 --> 00:06:23,989
So, I'm assuming that the
people on all these other earths

148
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:27,324
work to make money to pay bills and such.

149
00:06:27,326 --> 00:06:29,326
- I would imagine.
- So we got that in common.

150
00:06:29,328 --> 00:06:30,728
I'm heading back to the station.

151
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,463
Call me when this makes
a little bit more sense.

152
00:06:32,465 --> 00:06:33,831
I'm still trying to wrap my head

153
00:06:33,833 --> 00:06:34,965
around this whole idea of time travel.

154
00:06:38,671 --> 00:06:41,105
There is, uh, one problem that remains.

155
00:06:41,107 --> 00:06:43,507
If Mr. Garrick is telling the truth,

156
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:44,942
there is a breach

157
00:06:44,944 --> 00:06:46,844
somewhere in Central
City that we need to find

158
00:06:46,846 --> 00:06:48,612
and close for good.

159
00:06:48,614 --> 00:06:49,914
Yeah, but how do we find it?

160
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:51,382
We don't even know what to look for.

161
00:06:51,384 --> 00:06:53,250
Well, I... I suggest we
put our heads together

162
00:06:53,252 --> 00:06:56,287
and come up with a solution.

163
00:06:56,289 --> 00:06:59,023
Not literally, of course.

164
00:06:59,025 --> 00:07:01,492
Those days are over.

165
00:07:06,299 --> 00:07:09,667
- What'd you find?
- Well, Jay's heart rate is extraordinarily low.

166
00:07:09,669 --> 00:07:12,603
And he does have regenerative capabilities.

167
00:07:12,605 --> 00:07:14,271
Other than that, I'm
not seeing any evidence

168
00:07:14,273 --> 00:07:15,973
of the Speed Force in his system.

169
00:07:15,975 --> 00:07:17,608
We don't even have proof
that he's a speedster,

170
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:19,143
much less from another earth?

171
00:07:19,145 --> 00:07:20,678
Not necessarily.

172
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,812
What does that mean?

173
00:07:21,814 --> 00:07:23,647
Well, Jay doesn't know this,

174
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:25,082
but while I was testing his heart rate,

175
00:07:25,084 --> 00:07:26,884
blood pressure, and motor responses,

176
00:07:26,886 --> 00:07:30,721
I also measured his autonomic
reactions while we were talking.

177
00:07:30,723 --> 00:07:33,224
You gave him a lie detector test?

178
00:07:33,226 --> 00:07:35,626
And he passed it.

179
00:07:38,097 --> 00:07:39,897
What if he's not a good guy,

180
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:41,799
and he just wants to find our weaknesses?

181
00:07:41,801 --> 00:07:45,002
Keep running tests. See
what else you can find out.

182
00:07:56,249 --> 00:07:59,149
Detective West, sir.

183
00:07:59,151 --> 00:08:01,151
Yes, Officer... ?

184
00:08:01,153 --> 00:08:03,420
Spivot. Patty Spivot.

185
00:08:03,422 --> 00:08:05,089
Captain Singh mentioned
there may be positions

186
00:08:05,091 --> 00:08:06,957
available on your
anti-meta-human task force.

187
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:09,593
Yeah, everybody quit. There
is no task force anymore.

188
00:08:09,595 --> 00:08:13,063
Well, I know someone who's
interested in being on it.

189
00:08:13,065 --> 00:08:14,732
Me.

190
00:08:14,734 --> 00:08:15,900
You do realize that

191
00:08:15,902 --> 00:08:17,434
meta-humans have super powers, right?

192
00:08:17,436 --> 00:08:19,069
And even if they didn't,

193
00:08:19,071 --> 00:08:20,905
you wouldn't be a good fit for the team.

194
00:08:20,907 --> 00:08:22,306
Because I'm a woman?

195
00:08:22,308 --> 00:08:24,108
I didn't mean to imply that.

196
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:26,777
Good, because I know how
difficult this job would be,

197
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:28,712
but I think I'm an excellent candidate.

198
00:08:28,714 --> 00:08:31,415
I triple-majored at Hudson in
biology, chemistry, and physics.

199
00:08:31,417 --> 00:08:33,250
I'm in prime physical condition.

200
00:08:33,252 --> 00:08:35,286
And I rated top of my
class in marksmanship.

201
00:08:35,288 --> 00:08:36,687
Your class?

202
00:08:36,689 --> 00:08:38,188
You don't even have your stripes yet.

203
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,924
Soon. Been on the job seven months, sir.

204
00:08:39,926 --> 00:08:42,159
Are you aware of what happened
to my previous partner?

205
00:08:42,161 --> 00:08:43,460
Detective Thawne, yes.

206
00:08:43,462 --> 00:08:45,896
I know that he died and the one before him,

207
00:08:45,898 --> 00:08:48,265
Fred Chyre, died, too, but
the one before that's not dead,

208
00:08:48,267 --> 00:08:49,567
just transferred.

209
00:08:49,569 --> 00:08:51,502
I'm sure it had nothing to do with you.

210
00:08:51,504 --> 00:08:54,705
- Listen, Officer...
- Spivot, Patty Spivot.

211
00:08:54,707 --> 00:08:56,941
Yes, Spivot, the answer's no.

212
00:08:56,943 --> 00:08:58,876
All I'm asking for is a shot, sir.

213
00:08:58,878 --> 00:09:01,612
- Please, just an interview.
- You just had the interview.

214
00:09:01,614 --> 00:09:04,214
Didn't get the job.

215
00:09:12,158 --> 00:09:14,458
I hope you understand
why we have to do this.

216
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,793
I get it, kid.

217
00:09:15,795 --> 00:09:17,428
You're doing what you think you have to.

218
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,663
But you'll all realize
soon enough that this,

219
00:09:19,665 --> 00:09:21,799
the tests, it's unnecessary.

220
00:09:21,801 --> 00:09:23,567
I want to help you, Barry, not harm you.

221
00:09:23,569 --> 00:09:25,636
You're not the first person
that's said that to me.

222
00:09:25,638 --> 00:09:27,438
If what you told me about Zoom is true,

223
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,173
that he sent Rothstein here to kill you,

224
00:09:29,175 --> 00:09:30,708
instead of locking me up in here,

225
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,709
you better start listening.

226
00:09:31,711 --> 00:09:33,310
Because if Zoom is involved,

227
00:09:33,312 --> 00:09:35,546
you are gonna need a lot
more than just me at your side

228
00:09:35,548 --> 00:09:37,014
to stay alive.

229
00:09:37,016 --> 00:09:38,248
Barry, there's a fire at the waterfront.

230
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,984
Fire department's en route.

231
00:09:39,986 --> 00:09:42,152
I'm on my way.

232
00:09:42,154 --> 00:09:44,088
Be careful.

233
00:10:05,523 --> 00:10:06,688
That was the Flash.

234
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:18,534
That was a big fire.

235
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:20,068
It's out, Cisco.

236
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,803
Copy that, see you in a bit.

237
00:10:38,122 --> 00:10:41,189
I thought it would be harder than this.

238
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:56,305
Barry?

239
00:10:56,307 --> 00:10:59,007
Hello? Are you there?

240
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:00,676
- What was that?
- I don't know.

241
00:11:00,678 --> 00:11:03,679
We need to find out.

242
00:11:06,116 --> 00:11:08,317
- Bar.
- Hey.

243
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:09,685
What are we dealing with here?

244
00:11:09,687 --> 00:11:12,120
Pfft. Well, definitely a meta-human.

245
00:11:12,122 --> 00:11:14,289
Had a pretty solid look
at him between punches.

246
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,425
And he was, like, made of sand.

247
00:11:16,427 --> 00:11:17,693
- Sand?
- Mm-hmm.

248
00:11:17,695 --> 00:11:20,262
- Okay.
- These walls are too porous

249
00:11:20,264 --> 00:11:21,630
to pull any prints.

250
00:11:21,632 --> 00:11:22,931
I can't even get one off the boat,

251
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:25,000
but check this out.

252
00:11:25,002 --> 00:11:28,570
There's gasoline burns everywhere.

253
00:11:28,572 --> 00:11:30,072
Water didn't go off.

254
00:11:30,074 --> 00:11:32,741
Sprinklers weren't working.

255
00:11:32,743 --> 00:11:34,443
This was arson.

256
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:36,912
Excuse me? Barry Allen?

257
00:11:36,914 --> 00:11:38,513
- Yeah.
- Hi.

258
00:11:38,515 --> 00:11:41,316
Two days in a row,
Officer. What a coincidence.

259
00:11:41,318 --> 00:11:44,252
Or kismet, if you believe
in destiny or fate.

260
00:11:44,254 --> 00:11:46,355
Uh...

261
00:11:46,357 --> 00:11:48,423
- I'm Patty. Patty Spivot.
- Hey.

262
00:11:48,425 --> 00:11:49,558
I'm really excited to meet you.

263
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,094
- I'm a huge fan.
- Excuse me?

264
00:11:52,096 --> 00:11:54,963
Your forensic reports.
I... I read them sometimes.

265
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:56,164
Oh.

266
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:57,399
Who am I kidding? All the time.

267
00:11:57,401 --> 00:11:59,101
I've actually read them all.

268
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:02,004
Wow, I don't think that I've read them all.

269
00:12:02,006 --> 00:12:03,905
They're always so detailed.
You know, they really paint

270
00:12:03,907 --> 00:12:06,008
a picture like you were
somehow actually there

271
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:08,610
when somebody was being brutally murdered.

272
00:12:08,612 --> 00:12:09,578
Thank you.

273
00:12:10,848 --> 00:12:13,548
Uh, anyhow, I... I found, uh, something.

274
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:15,817
Well, I think I found
something. It's just a theory,

275
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:18,353
- but I would like to show you.
- Great.

276
00:12:18,355 --> 00:12:21,823
So, this right here is the
point of origin of the fire.

277
00:12:21,825 --> 00:12:24,226
And look.

278
00:12:24,228 --> 00:12:25,527
I don't know a sandblaster on the market

279
00:12:25,529 --> 00:12:27,029
that can make a cut that precise,

280
00:12:27,031 --> 00:12:29,431
so I think a meta-human may have done this.

281
00:12:29,433 --> 00:12:31,566
Here. Took a sample for you.

282
00:12:31,568 --> 00:12:33,201
Uh, there's also some fingerprints

283
00:12:33,203 --> 00:12:34,536
on the back of the pipe.

284
00:12:34,538 --> 00:12:36,471
You should have gone into CSI work.

285
00:12:36,473 --> 00:12:39,207
I love the science, but out
here's where all the action is.

286
00:12:39,209 --> 00:12:40,709
Isn't that right, Detective West?

287
00:12:40,711 --> 00:12:41,943
Mm.

288
00:12:41,945 --> 00:12:43,979
The answer's still no, Officer S...

289
00:12:43,981 --> 00:12:47,015
- Spivot, yeah.
- Spivot.

290
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:48,617
What was that about?

291
00:12:48,619 --> 00:12:50,752
I'm trying to join the
anti-meta-human task force.

292
00:12:50,754 --> 00:12:53,555
- Ah.
- But you heard him.

293
00:12:53,557 --> 00:12:55,290
Hey, he's kinda like your dad, right?

294
00:12:55,292 --> 00:12:57,726
So, do you have any advice on
how I can crack his no-code?

295
00:12:57,728 --> 00:13:00,662
Yeah, I've been trying to
pick that lock since I was 11.

296
00:13:00,664 --> 00:13:02,931
So, if you figure it out,
how about you let me know?

297
00:13:02,933 --> 00:13:04,132
- Deal.
- All right.

298
00:13:04,134 --> 00:13:05,200
It was nice to meet you, Barry.

299
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:08,370
Yeah, you too. Ahem.

300
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,613
His blood pressure is
low, his heart rate is low,

301
00:13:18,615 --> 00:13:21,183
his oxygen levels are impressive.

302
00:13:21,185 --> 00:13:23,785
Yeah, but nothing compared to Barry's.

303
00:13:23,787 --> 00:13:27,189
No, but he's certainly in
the physical specimen range.

304
00:13:27,191 --> 00:13:30,258
- In more ways than one.
- Hmm?

305
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,894
Oh, I wasn't paying attention.

306
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,730
That's enough for today, Jay.

307
00:13:34,732 --> 00:13:36,364
Thank you.

308
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:39,968
Found it at the crime scene.

309
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:42,704
I mean, it's gotta be from the
meta-human that attacked me.

310
00:13:42,706 --> 00:13:44,272
Huh.

311
00:13:44,274 --> 00:13:45,407
What is this stuff? Sand?

312
00:13:45,409 --> 00:13:47,008
It's not sand.

313
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:49,144
It's human cells whose myosin II protein

314
00:13:49,146 --> 00:13:51,146
have migrated to the cell's periphery.

315
00:13:51,148 --> 00:13:53,248
Jay's a fellow science nerd.

316
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,418
Those cells have the ability
to rearrange and harden,

317
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,487
giving them the appearance of sand.

318
00:13:58,489 --> 00:14:00,388
And how do you know this?

319
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,790
They belong to a meta-human

320
00:14:01,792 --> 00:14:03,058
I've fought before named Sand Demon.

321
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,359
I know you're new here,

322
00:14:04,361 --> 00:14:05,794
so I'm just gonna break it down for you.

323
00:14:05,796 --> 00:14:07,362
The whole "naming the bad guys thing,"

324
00:14:07,364 --> 00:14:09,531
that's my jam. But you know what?

325
00:14:09,533 --> 00:14:10,665
I'm gonna let you have that one

326
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:11,733
'cause I actually kinda like it.

327
00:14:11,735 --> 00:14:12,734
I'm not mad at that one.

328
00:14:12,736 --> 00:14:14,102
Is that Barry's sweatshirt?

329
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:16,605
Oh, uh, sorry. It was
all we could find, so...

330
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:19,074
I was gonna say, 'cause
it looks a lot smaller

331
00:14:19,076 --> 00:14:23,145
on you, right?

332
00:14:23,847 --> 00:14:26,548
I gotta do this thing.

333
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,084
So, who is this Sand Demon?

334
00:14:29,086 --> 00:14:30,385
I don't know his name,

335
00:14:30,387 --> 00:14:31,853
but I know how to stop him.

336
00:14:31,855 --> 00:14:33,155
You know what?

337
00:14:33,157 --> 00:14:34,923
I think we'll be fine on our own.

338
00:14:34,925 --> 00:14:37,359
Look, Barry, I don't
know what else I can do

339
00:14:37,361 --> 00:14:39,294
to prove to you I'm on your side.

340
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:40,695
I've been poked, prodded.

341
00:14:40,697 --> 00:14:43,799
I even subjected myself
to a full body scan.

342
00:14:43,801 --> 00:14:45,133
I was being thorough.

343
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:46,802
Sand Demon's from my world.

344
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:49,271
Let me teach you how to stop him.

345
00:14:49,273 --> 00:14:52,407
Yeah, I don't need you
to teach me anything, Jay.

346
00:14:52,409 --> 00:14:54,509
Zoom sent Rothstein here to kill you.

347
00:14:54,511 --> 00:14:56,611
He must have sent Sand Demon
here to do the same thing.

348
00:14:56,613 --> 00:14:58,446
Don't you get it? Anyone
close to the Flash,

349
00:14:58,448 --> 00:15:00,282
all of you, are in a lot of danger.

350
00:15:00,284 --> 00:15:01,983
All right.

351
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:03,919
If you're so good,

352
00:15:03,921 --> 00:15:05,887
you would have caught him already.

353
00:15:07,925 --> 00:15:10,025
Let's get Jay back to his cell.

354
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,466
Whoa.

355
00:15:18,468 --> 00:15:20,468
Hey, beautiful mind,

356
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:23,271
I think you need to take a breather.

357
00:15:23,273 --> 00:15:25,674
After some, uh, lengthy calculations,

358
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:27,475
I believe I have discovered the key

359
00:15:27,477 --> 00:15:30,312
to proving the proposed breach theory.

360
00:15:30,314 --> 00:15:33,114
Exotic matter.

361
00:15:33,116 --> 00:15:34,516
Huh.

362
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:35,684
You mean, like,

363
00:15:35,686 --> 00:15:36,918
transdimensional energy?

364
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,120
Precisely. Exotic matter,

365
00:15:39,122 --> 00:15:42,224
transdimensional energy
will theoretically leak

366
00:15:42,226 --> 00:15:44,659
from one universe into another.

367
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:46,828
Now, if this breach Mr.
Garrick's talking about

368
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,763
is real, if there is indeed

369
00:15:48,765 --> 00:15:53,268
a hole in our universe
which leads to his earth...

370
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,970
We can make some adjustments

371
00:15:54,972 --> 00:15:57,305
and upload an electrophotography program

372
00:15:57,307 --> 00:15:58,707
to the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite

373
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:00,876
and essentially photograph

374
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:02,344
the exotic matter leak.

375
00:16:02,346 --> 00:16:05,647
Thereby giving us the
locale of said breach.

376
00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:08,049
Last time I saw the kit, it
was in the fabrication room.

377
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:09,885
- I shall return.
- Oh, hoo, hoo.

378
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:12,554
- Ha-ha!
- Getting gooseys.

379
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:14,489
All right.

380
00:16:14,491 --> 00:16:18,093
Let's see what you're made of.

381
00:16:18,095 --> 00:16:19,628
That's too much.

382
00:16:28,505 --> 00:16:30,238
Barry?

383
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:36,281
I thought it'd be harder than this.

384
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,253
What's happening to me?

385
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,037
- Hey.
- I found our meta.

386
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:03,305
His name is Eddie Slick.

387
00:17:03,307 --> 00:17:04,906
We tracked those prints to his address.

388
00:17:04,908 --> 00:17:07,509
All right, where are
you? I'll meet you there.

389
00:17:07,511 --> 00:17:08,543
Too late. He made me.

390
00:17:08,545 --> 00:17:10,378
What? Joe?

391
00:17:31,034 --> 00:17:34,836
So, can I be on your task force?

392
00:17:44,098 --> 00:17:46,898
That look familiar?

393
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:49,801
How about now?

394
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:51,203
- What's it look like?
- A fire.

395
00:17:51,205 --> 00:17:52,838
There you go, genius.

396
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,806
It's the fire you started
in the third ward last night.

397
00:17:54,808 --> 00:17:57,042
Man, I didn't start no
fire there last night.

398
00:17:57,044 --> 00:17:58,577
What? Were you out of town?

399
00:17:58,579 --> 00:17:59,945
Your cat get sick?

400
00:17:59,947 --> 00:18:01,313
Well, let me guess.

401
00:18:01,315 --> 00:18:02,614
You don't start fires anymore.

402
00:18:02,616 --> 00:18:04,016
You been rehabilitated.

403
00:18:04,018 --> 00:18:05,584
Yeah, I done it before. So what?

404
00:18:05,656 --> 00:18:07,556
I didn't do this one.

405
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:11,426
I always start a fire with
something that's hard to trace.

406
00:18:11,428 --> 00:18:13,662
You know, like acetone or something.

407
00:18:13,664 --> 00:18:17,466
Or maybe you don't need
to use accelerants anymore.

408
00:18:17,468 --> 00:18:19,167
Iron Heights can hold people like you now.

409
00:18:19,169 --> 00:18:20,635
You know that, right?

410
00:18:20,637 --> 00:18:22,738
You think I'm one of
those meta-human freaks?

411
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:25,273
If I had powers, you don't
think I would have used them

412
00:18:25,275 --> 00:18:26,475
to get away from you?

413
00:18:26,477 --> 00:18:27,976
December, 2013. Where were you?

414
00:18:27,978 --> 00:18:30,011
- Why?
- Answer the damn question.

415
00:18:30,013 --> 00:18:32,547
- Where were you?
- Blackgate Penitentiary.

416
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:35,350
You don't believe me. Check your records.

417
00:18:35,352 --> 00:18:37,285
Jimmy, I need you to
confirm something for me.

418
00:18:37,287 --> 00:18:39,521
So, Joe told me what you did.

419
00:18:39,523 --> 00:18:40,722
I'm impressed.

420
00:18:40,724 --> 00:18:42,758
No, all I did was, you know,

421
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,292
run the other print
from the electrical pipe,

422
00:18:44,294 --> 00:18:45,994
then track Slick down from there.

423
00:18:45,996 --> 00:18:48,096
That's all.

424
00:18:48,098 --> 00:18:49,898
Yeah.

425
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,133
How's it going with Joe?

426
00:18:51,135 --> 00:18:53,468
You any closer to cracking his no-code?

427
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,736
Are you kidding me?

428
00:18:54,738 --> 00:18:56,738
He's like the permission Sphinx.

429
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,508
Or like a magic eight
ball with just one answer.

430
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,842
Or like, you know,

431
00:19:00,844 --> 00:19:02,544
the Bridgekeeper protecting the Holy Grail.

432
00:19:02,546 --> 00:19:05,280
- What is your quest?
- Oh, to join your task force.

433
00:19:05,282 --> 00:19:07,382
- No.
- Aah!

434
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,222
Well, maybe I can put
in a good word for you.

435
00:19:13,824 --> 00:19:19,060
That would mean a lot to me, Barry.

436
00:19:19,062 --> 00:19:20,128
- He needs me.
- Yeah.

437
00:19:21,698 --> 00:19:25,267
Okay, so, Slick wasn't in Central City

438
00:19:25,269 --> 00:19:27,335
the night the particle
accelerator exploded.

439
00:19:27,337 --> 00:19:28,570
He's lying.

440
00:19:28,572 --> 00:19:30,338
He's a dirt bag, and an arsonist,

441
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,840
but he's not lying about
this. He's not a meta, Barry.

442
00:19:31,842 --> 00:19:34,242
Slick is the guy who jumped me.

443
00:19:34,244 --> 00:19:35,710
Do you think it's possible

444
00:19:35,712 --> 00:19:37,612
that the Slick in there has a...

445
00:19:37,614 --> 00:19:41,650
A doppelganger? I don't know.

446
00:19:41,652 --> 00:19:44,953
Yesterday's surprise broadcast
from a Star City vigilante

447
00:19:44,955 --> 00:19:47,155
who is calling himself the Green Arrow

448
00:19:47,157 --> 00:19:48,590
has spawned a massive outcry of
both support and dissenters...

449
00:19:48,592 --> 00:19:50,058
Catchy.

450
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:53,028
I hate it when they put
a color in their name.

451
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,230
- Yo.
- Yo.

452
00:19:55,232 --> 00:19:56,398
- The sample you gave us?
- Yeah.

453
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,833
Not sand.

454
00:19:57,835 --> 00:19:59,401
Definitely human cells.

455
00:19:59,403 --> 00:20:01,603
Yeah, I know. It's not him, I get it.

456
00:20:01,605 --> 00:20:03,705
I hate to say it, but I
think this Earth-2 theory

457
00:20:03,707 --> 00:20:05,474
- is starting to make sense.
- For real?

458
00:20:05,476 --> 00:20:07,909
What, you think Jay is
lying about the Sand Demon?

459
00:20:07,911 --> 00:20:10,145
I don't know. That's my point.

460
00:20:10,147 --> 00:20:13,649
But I'm not gonna just believe
some guy that walks in here

461
00:20:14,451 --> 00:20:17,085
and says a few things
that sort of check out.

462
00:20:17,087 --> 00:20:19,554
Sort of? He was... he was right about Zoom.

463
00:20:19,556 --> 00:20:21,389
We don't even know anything about Zoom.

464
00:20:21,391 --> 00:20:23,225
What is Zoom? Is Zoom even real?

465
00:20:23,227 --> 00:20:25,427
Right now, that's just, you know, a story

466
00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:26,728
around a campfire.

467
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:29,331
I mean, have you discovered a breach yet?

468
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,466
Not yet, but we know how to now.

469
00:20:31,468 --> 00:20:35,237
Have you found one thing to
suggest that Jay is a speedster?

470
00:20:35,239 --> 00:20:38,440
Is the Speed Force even in his system?

471
00:20:38,442 --> 00:20:41,343
It doesn't appear to be, no.

472
00:20:41,345 --> 00:20:43,411
See?

473
00:20:43,413 --> 00:20:45,514
We are scientists.

474
00:20:45,516 --> 00:20:47,249
You are a journalist.

475
00:20:47,251 --> 00:20:50,485
We test, we prove, we
report. That's what we do.

476
00:20:50,487 --> 00:20:53,522
Except right now, nobody
here wants to do any of that

477
00:20:53,524 --> 00:20:55,526
except me.

478
00:20:59,463 --> 00:21:01,196
Can we have the room for a minute?

479
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:09,471
What has happened to you?

480
00:21:09,473 --> 00:21:11,373
Are you... me?

481
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,108
Yes, you.

482
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,476
The you that I grew up with.

483
00:21:14,478 --> 00:21:16,278
The you that is my best friend.

484
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,679
The you that became The Flash.

485
00:21:17,681 --> 00:21:20,382
I haven't seen that
you in a very long time.

486
00:21:20,384 --> 00:21:22,050
A lot's changed, Iris.

487
00:21:22,052 --> 00:21:23,451
Yeah, it sure has.

488
00:21:23,453 --> 00:21:27,188
You have learned how to not trust people.

489
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,624
What is it about Jay that you don't like?

490
00:21:29,626 --> 00:21:32,327
I don't know.

491
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:34,866
It's because he reminds
you of Harrison Wells.

492
00:21:37,868 --> 00:21:39,734
I trusted that man.

493
00:21:39,736 --> 00:21:41,770
For months. We all did.

494
00:21:45,042 --> 00:21:47,042
And you know what?

495
00:21:47,044 --> 00:21:48,910
Eddie is dead.

496
00:21:48,912 --> 00:21:50,745
Ronnie is dead.

497
00:21:50,747 --> 00:21:54,483
And a whole lot of other
people in this city,

498
00:21:55,185 --> 00:21:56,651
they are dead

499
00:21:56,653 --> 00:21:58,253
because we trusted him.

500
00:21:58,255 --> 00:22:01,656
I'm not gonna let us
make that mistake again.

501
00:22:01,658 --> 00:22:04,496
Barry, not everyone is Harrison Wells.

502
00:22:08,498 --> 00:22:11,935
Besides, you defeated him
because you trusted in people.

503
00:22:13,337 --> 00:22:17,238
Because you believed in them.

504
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,341
This team that you have here,

505
00:22:19,343 --> 00:22:20,575
they will follow your lead.

506
00:22:20,577 --> 00:22:23,278
They'll do what you say.

507
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,514
But if they think that
you don't believe in them,

508
00:22:26,516 --> 00:22:29,417
it won't be long before
they don't believe in you.

509
00:22:35,058 --> 00:22:36,992
Get to walking.

510
00:22:36,994 --> 00:22:39,127
I don't want to see your
ugly mug around here again.

511
00:22:39,129 --> 00:22:40,762
Sayonara.

512
00:22:44,401 --> 00:22:45,800
We didn't have probable cause.

513
00:22:45,802 --> 00:22:46,801
I get it.

514
00:22:46,803 --> 00:22:48,069
One thing you should know

515
00:22:48,071 --> 00:22:49,371
about dealing with these meta-humans,

516
00:22:49,373 --> 00:22:51,773
nothing is ever as it seems.

517
00:22:51,775 --> 00:22:52,941
Speaking of which,

518
00:22:52,943 --> 00:22:54,242
you're the only person here

519
00:22:54,244 --> 00:22:56,077
who wants to be on my task force.

520
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:58,446
You want to tell me why you're
so hell-bent on being on it?

521
00:22:58,448 --> 00:23:01,616
You want to tell me why
you're so hell-bent I'm not?

522
00:23:05,255 --> 00:23:06,821
Didn't I just tell you

523
00:23:06,823 --> 00:23:08,723
I didn't want to see your
ugly mug around here again?

524
00:23:08,725 --> 00:23:11,493
Well, you're gonna have to, Detective West.

525
00:23:11,495 --> 00:23:14,362
So I can get to the Flash.

526
00:23:20,237 --> 00:23:22,003
Hey!

527
00:23:28,111 --> 00:23:31,680
I like you. You'll do the trick...

528
00:23:31,682 --> 00:23:33,581
just fine.

529
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,453
Finally come to your senses?

530
00:23:50,455 --> 00:23:52,822
Sand Demon kidnapped a police officer.

531
00:23:52,824 --> 00:23:54,057
A woman that I know.

532
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:55,325
And you need my help?

533
00:23:55,327 --> 00:23:58,161
I need you to help us save her.

534
00:23:58,163 --> 00:24:00,897
Before something happens.

535
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:02,999
I guess you're gonna have
to trust me now, huh, kid?

536
00:24:04,369 --> 00:24:05,635
We're looking for any structures

537
00:24:05,637 --> 00:24:07,036
that promote humidity.

538
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:09,205
Greenhouses, grow rooms,
anything of the sort.

539
00:24:09,207 --> 00:24:11,174
His body will literally start to fall apart

540
00:24:11,176 --> 00:24:12,508
if he becomes dehydrated.

541
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,110
- Like dry sand.
- Exactly.

542
00:24:14,112 --> 00:24:16,479
Sand Demon always attacks on two fronts.

543
00:24:16,481 --> 00:24:18,681
He creates a diversion, then
strikes when you're distracted.

544
00:24:18,683 --> 00:24:19,916
Okay, then what do we do?

545
00:24:19,918 --> 00:24:21,251
We use your speed to get to him

546
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:23,186
before the distraction can happen.

547
00:24:23,188 --> 00:24:26,322
Jay, how do I stop somebody
who can slip through my fingers?

548
00:24:26,324 --> 00:24:28,725
The way I was never able to.

549
00:24:28,727 --> 00:24:30,193
With lightning.

550
00:24:30,195 --> 00:24:32,729
Yo, are you about to pull a Zeus right now?

551
00:24:32,731 --> 00:24:34,063
What are you talking about?

552
00:24:34,065 --> 00:24:35,465
Barry's gonna hurl lightning

553
00:24:35,467 --> 00:24:37,934
from the energy he creates when he runs.

554
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:39,902
Because lightning plus sand equals...

555
00:24:39,904 --> 00:24:41,170
Glass.

556
00:24:41,172 --> 00:24:43,406
Time to learn something new, kid.

557
00:24:44,843 --> 00:24:46,276
All right.

558
00:24:46,278 --> 00:24:47,610
Choo!

559
00:24:51,249 --> 00:24:52,815
Give me a sec.

560
00:24:54,052 --> 00:24:55,785
Hey, are you good?

561
00:24:55,787 --> 00:24:57,053
That was Singh.

562
00:24:57,055 --> 00:24:58,755
CCPD still hasn't found anything yet.

563
00:24:58,757 --> 00:25:01,257
Irony is, I didn't want Patty
to have anything to do with

564
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:02,525
the damn task force in the first place.

565
00:25:02,527 --> 00:25:04,093
And she gets taken because of me.

566
00:25:04,095 --> 00:25:05,461
No, no, no, this isn't
your fault, all right?

567
00:25:05,463 --> 00:25:07,230
It's hard not to think that.

568
00:25:07,232 --> 00:25:09,132
Well, look, we're gonna
find Patty, all right?

569
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:12,735
Whatever it takes.

570
00:25:24,516 --> 00:25:26,649
Flash is coming for you, you know?

571
00:25:26,651 --> 00:25:28,918
Yes, I'm sure he is.

572
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,187
You can't beat him.

573
00:25:31,189 --> 00:25:33,723
I don't care what powers you have.

574
00:25:33,725 --> 00:25:36,993
I wouldn't be too sure about that.

575
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:40,296
Is that why you need to
build that concussive bomb?

576
00:25:40,298 --> 00:25:41,931
Yeah, I know what it is.

577
00:25:41,933 --> 00:25:45,401
I'm a cop. I've seen one before.

578
00:25:45,403 --> 00:25:48,237
This isn't gonna kill the Flash.

579
00:25:48,239 --> 00:25:49,339
I am.

580
00:25:49,341 --> 00:25:53,176
This... is gonna kill you.

581
00:25:57,549 --> 00:26:01,250
You know you got lucky, right?

582
00:26:01,252 --> 00:26:03,953
You think you were chosen.

583
00:26:03,955 --> 00:26:06,089
The rest of us don't mean anything.

584
00:26:06,091 --> 00:26:07,590
But it's not true.

585
00:26:07,592 --> 00:26:11,228
You were just at the right
place at the right time.

586
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:14,464
Getting those powers
didn't change who you are.

587
00:26:14,466 --> 00:26:17,800
They only highlighted the worst
parts of who you already were.

588
00:26:17,802 --> 00:26:20,470
Maybe you're right.

589
00:26:20,472 --> 00:26:22,305
Maybe not.

590
00:26:22,307 --> 00:26:24,474
Either way, you and the
Flash are about to find out

591
00:26:24,476 --> 00:26:26,342
what those worst parts are.

592
00:26:30,915 --> 00:26:32,915
I've searched all the vacant
buildings in Central City

593
00:26:32,917 --> 00:26:35,551
and none of them fit the
description that we need.

594
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:37,987
And I've looked at any draw
upticks on the electrical grid.

595
00:26:37,989 --> 00:26:39,989
Nothing out of the norm, I'm afraid.

596
00:26:39,991 --> 00:26:42,458
We gotta do whatever it takes.

597
00:26:44,729 --> 00:26:46,863
I'll be back.

598
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:52,368
Okay, come on.

599
00:27:04,249 --> 00:27:07,049
Flash is coming for you, you know?

600
00:27:07,051 --> 00:27:10,353
Yes, I'm sure he is.

601
00:27:10,355 --> 00:27:12,321
You can't beat him.

602
00:27:12,323 --> 00:27:14,824
I don't care what powers you have.

603
00:27:14,826 --> 00:27:18,161
I wouldn't be too sure about that.

604
00:27:18,863 --> 00:27:21,831
Oh, no.

605
00:27:24,702 --> 00:27:26,602
Mr. Ramon?

606
00:27:26,604 --> 00:27:29,906
What are you doing down here?

607
00:27:29,908 --> 00:27:31,974
I figured out where Patty is.

608
00:27:31,976 --> 00:27:35,545
And how exactly did you do that?

609
00:27:35,547 --> 00:27:38,714
Just a hunch.

610
00:27:38,716 --> 00:27:40,249
We gotta tell Barry.

611
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:00,887
Again.

612
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:05,258
I've been doing this for an hour.

613
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,827
It's not working.

614
00:28:06,829 --> 00:28:09,062
It's because you're trying to rush it.

615
00:28:09,064 --> 00:28:12,533
This is the one time you need to slow down.

616
00:28:13,035 --> 00:28:15,035
Let the energy pass over you,

617
00:28:15,037 --> 00:28:17,737
then simply direct it to
where you want it to go.

618
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:19,206
All right, Jay...

619
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:20,607
I don't know if I'm gonna get this in time.

620
00:28:20,609 --> 00:28:23,643
You'll get it. I believe in you.

621
00:28:23,645 --> 00:28:25,278
The last person that helped me like this

622
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,080
was a man that I looked up to.

623
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:28,548
Idolized.

624
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:30,884
He taught me how to get
faster, how to get stronger,

625
00:28:30,886 --> 00:28:34,120
how to use my powers to save people.

626
00:28:34,122 --> 00:28:36,223
That same man murdered my mother.

627
00:28:39,895 --> 00:28:42,095
It's a tough break,

628
00:28:42,097 --> 00:28:45,165
but I'm not him.

629
00:28:45,167 --> 00:28:47,767
Yeah.

630
00:28:47,769 --> 00:28:49,169
I know where they are!

631
00:28:51,406 --> 00:28:53,206
The abandoned Woodrue grow house.

632
00:28:53,208 --> 00:28:54,541
That's where Slick's keeping Patty.

633
00:28:54,543 --> 00:28:56,142
Dude, great job.

634
00:28:56,144 --> 00:28:58,778
And I was thinking, if I were Sand Demon

635
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,881
and I were attacking a
speedster on two fronts,

636
00:29:00,883 --> 00:29:02,849
I would probably want to slow you down,

637
00:29:02,851 --> 00:29:05,318
like, by using a concussive bomb

638
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,621
- or something like that.
- That's a good thought.

639
00:29:07,623 --> 00:29:09,523
He's actually used one on me before.

640
00:29:09,525 --> 00:29:11,791
His body absorbs the blast
so it doesn't affect him.

641
00:29:11,793 --> 00:29:14,528
Well, kid, gonna have
to think of something.

642
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:15,662
You know what?

643
00:29:15,664 --> 00:29:17,397
What if we give Slick a diversion?

644
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:18,465
He knows you, right?

645
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:19,833
You said you went up against him.

646
00:29:19,835 --> 00:29:22,602
Yeah, but, Barry, I don't have my speed.

647
00:29:22,604 --> 00:29:23,937
He doesn't know that.

648
00:29:23,939 --> 00:29:25,272
You got your suit?

649
00:29:25,274 --> 00:29:27,340
Sure. Well, except my helmet.

650
00:29:27,342 --> 00:29:29,042
- Helmet?
- Silver kettle helmet?

651
00:29:29,044 --> 00:29:30,277
Gold wings?

652
00:29:30,279 --> 00:29:33,680
Don't tell me you guys found it.

653
00:29:40,822 --> 00:29:42,289
Never thought I'd see that again.

654
00:29:46,295 --> 00:29:47,827
It was my father's,

655
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:49,396
from the War of the Americas.

656
00:29:49,398 --> 00:29:51,831
Did you just say War of the Americas?

657
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:54,467
I wish you would have just
told us you lost your helmet.

658
00:29:54,469 --> 00:29:56,503
Would have saved us all a headache.

659
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:05,579
Well, sure you want to do this, Flash?

660
00:30:05,581 --> 00:30:07,213
Yeah.

661
00:30:07,215 --> 00:30:10,250
Let's go see what you're made of... Flash.

662
00:30:26,168 --> 00:30:27,400
I'm in the security feed.

663
00:30:27,402 --> 00:30:29,636
Go, Barry!

664
00:30:32,374 --> 00:30:34,908
Is that you, Flash?

665
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:36,176
Found your way here.

666
00:30:39,348 --> 00:30:41,514
I came quite a distance.

667
00:30:41,516 --> 00:30:42,716
I thought you were dead.

668
00:30:42,718 --> 00:30:44,284
You were wrong.

669
00:30:44,286 --> 00:30:45,685
Like usual.

670
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,056
Let the girl go.

671
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:52,025
Have at it. But you touch her,

672
00:30:52,027 --> 00:30:54,661
she goes boom.

673
00:30:54,663 --> 00:30:58,465
And I think even you aren't
fast enough to save her.

674
00:31:02,537 --> 00:31:05,472
Quite a bit slower on this
Earth, aren't you, Flash?

675
00:31:14,916 --> 00:31:17,083
You don't have your speed, do you?

676
00:31:17,085 --> 00:31:19,352
Slick's distracted. Go, Barry.

677
00:31:46,481 --> 00:31:47,647
- Jay!
- Barry!

678
00:31:51,853 --> 00:31:53,486
Patty's alive.

679
00:31:53,488 --> 00:31:55,522
Must be my lucky day.

680
00:31:55,524 --> 00:31:57,557
Zoom sent me here to kill you.

681
00:31:57,559 --> 00:31:59,592
Now I get to kill The Flash from two worlds

682
00:31:59,594 --> 00:32:02,228
before I go home.

683
00:32:04,466 --> 00:32:05,732
He's choking Jay.

684
00:32:05,734 --> 00:32:07,467
Barry, you gotta do something now.

685
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,680
Come on!

686
00:32:29,891 --> 00:32:32,459
Aah!

687
00:32:46,508 --> 00:32:48,041
You okay?

688
00:32:48,043 --> 00:32:50,110
Yeah. I'm okay.

689
00:32:50,112 --> 00:32:51,411
Nice shot, kid.

690
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:56,883
Flash?

691
00:32:56,885 --> 00:32:58,218
Coming.

692
00:33:11,937 --> 00:33:13,203
You're pretty good at this.

693
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,906
I've had a lot of practice
over the last year.

694
00:33:15,908 --> 00:33:18,308
Mm.

695
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:21,445
It was really courageous
doing what you did today,

696
00:33:22,347 --> 00:33:25,048
standing up to the Sand
Demon without any powers.

697
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:27,717
Ah, Barry did all the work.

698
00:33:27,719 --> 00:33:29,819
I just stood there and took a few punches.

699
00:33:29,821 --> 00:33:32,222
It was more than a few.

700
00:33:32,224 --> 00:33:35,191
This is a lot harder than I thought.

701
00:33:35,193 --> 00:33:36,693
Losing something that was such a big part

702
00:33:36,695 --> 00:33:39,462
of who I was for so long.

703
00:33:39,464 --> 00:33:42,767
I lost something that
was a part of me, too.

704
00:33:43,569 --> 00:33:45,969
It's hard,

705
00:33:45,971 --> 00:33:49,406
but it gets easier every day.

706
00:33:52,444 --> 00:33:56,013
You just have to find a new way to live.

707
00:33:57,115 --> 00:33:59,115
Just because it's a different life

708
00:33:59,117 --> 00:34:01,217
it doesn't mean it's a worse one.

709
00:34:05,991 --> 00:34:08,725
And, speed or no speed,

710
00:34:08,727 --> 00:34:11,428
in my book you were still a hero today.

711
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:13,196
I'm just sorry

712
00:34:13,198 --> 00:34:15,932
we didn't all realize
it a little bit sooner.

713
00:34:15,934 --> 00:34:18,068
Especially me.

714
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:20,604
I'll leave you two speedsters alone.

715
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:25,508
So, I hear they call you
"The Scarlet Speedster""

716
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:27,444
Yeah.

717
00:34:27,446 --> 00:34:29,179
- What about you?
- "The Crimson Comet."

718
00:34:29,181 --> 00:34:31,314
- Mm.
- What is it with

719
00:34:31,316 --> 00:34:32,782
alliteration and nicknames?

720
00:34:34,586 --> 00:34:38,421
Hey, look, Jay, um...

721
00:34:38,423 --> 00:34:41,257
So, thank you for all your help.

722
00:34:41,259 --> 00:34:44,260
And for being so patient with me.

723
00:34:44,262 --> 00:34:47,263
Nah, anytime, kid. You're a quick study.

724
00:34:47,265 --> 00:34:49,199
Took me a lot longer to
learn how to toss lightning,

725
00:34:49,201 --> 00:34:50,433
believe me.

726
00:34:50,435 --> 00:34:52,836
Then I suppose I had the right teacher.

727
00:34:52,838 --> 00:34:56,373
It's going to be a lot
harder to take down Zoom.

728
00:34:57,275 --> 00:34:58,742
Who is this guy?

729
00:34:58,744 --> 00:35:00,543
No one knows.

730
00:35:00,545 --> 00:35:03,446
He showed up around the same
time as when I got my powers.

731
00:35:03,448 --> 00:35:05,548
Killed a lot of people in my world.

732
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:07,586
I spent about two years tracking him down.

733
00:35:09,588 --> 00:35:12,355
But he was too smart, too quick.

734
00:35:12,357 --> 00:35:15,392
He's always one step ahead.

735
00:35:15,394 --> 00:35:17,060
You really think he's just

736
00:35:17,062 --> 00:35:19,095
bringing these guys here to kill me?

737
00:35:19,097 --> 00:35:21,364
Zoom is obsessed with destroying me.

738
00:35:21,366 --> 00:35:24,134
- Now he wants to destroy you.
- Yeah.

739
00:35:24,136 --> 00:35:27,237
He needs to be the best.

740
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:29,539
And he will do whatever it takes

741
00:35:29,541 --> 00:35:32,909
to ensure he's the only speedster.

742
00:35:32,911 --> 00:35:33,910
In any world.

743
00:35:37,582 --> 00:35:39,716
- Officer Spivot?
- Detective.

744
00:35:39,718 --> 00:35:40,917
You're supposed to be home resting.

745
00:35:40,919 --> 00:35:42,552
I'm okay, sir, really.

746
00:35:42,554 --> 00:35:44,888
Look, I'm sorry you got
mixed up in all this mess

747
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:46,122
because of me.

748
00:35:46,124 --> 00:35:48,091
It's not your fault.

749
00:35:48,093 --> 00:35:49,826
Do you really think you have what it takes

750
00:35:49,828 --> 00:35:51,695
to be part of my task force?

751
00:35:51,697 --> 00:35:53,396
I know it, sir.

752
00:35:53,398 --> 00:35:55,298
Well, I always check the jacket of anyone

753
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,499
I'm considering for it.

754
00:35:56,501 --> 00:35:58,268
In my research on you,

755
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:01,204
I found out we got a mutual acquaintance.

756
00:36:01,206 --> 00:36:03,940
Mark Mardon.

757
00:36:03,942 --> 00:36:05,942
I need you to be honest with me here.

758
00:36:05,944 --> 00:36:08,046
Why do you want to do this?

759
00:36:10,048 --> 00:36:13,216
Mark Mardon killed my dad.

760
00:36:16,588 --> 00:36:20,257
He had a little shoe
shop down on Chesterfield.

761
00:36:20,859 --> 00:36:22,592
It was a cash business.

762
00:36:22,594 --> 00:36:25,128
One night he went to Fairfield bank

763
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:27,097
to make his weekly deposit,

764
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:30,400
and the Mardon brothers showed up.

765
00:36:30,402 --> 00:36:33,136
While he was waiting in line,

766
00:36:33,138 --> 00:36:36,673
Mark shot my dad in the face
for a few hundred dollars.

767
00:36:38,977 --> 00:36:42,679
Then a few months later, Mark
and his brother got powers.

768
00:36:43,281 --> 00:36:46,182
Two murderers got superpowers.

769
00:36:46,184 --> 00:36:47,951
So that's why I'm here, Sir.

770
00:36:47,953 --> 00:36:51,589
That's why I'm so hell-bent
on being on your task force.

771
00:36:52,591 --> 00:36:54,858
'Cause there's some bad people out there

772
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:58,062
and they can do anything.

773
00:36:58,864 --> 00:37:01,364
And I may not have powers,

774
00:37:01,366 --> 00:37:04,267
but I want to stop them.

775
00:37:04,269 --> 00:37:07,270
You're the only person I know
who wants to do that, too.

776
00:37:13,245 --> 00:37:15,714
Monday, 8:00 a.m.

777
00:37:17,716 --> 00:37:19,415
Don't be late.

778
00:37:19,417 --> 00:37:22,252
Uh, late for what?

779
00:37:22,254 --> 00:37:24,821
The task force, Detective.

780
00:37:34,432 --> 00:37:37,000
Joseph.

781
00:37:39,671 --> 00:37:42,071
Hi.

782
00:37:42,073 --> 00:37:45,241
Been a long time.

783
00:37:48,413 --> 00:37:51,781
Yeah, it has.

784
00:37:51,783 --> 00:37:53,616
Why are you here?

785
00:37:53,618 --> 00:37:56,152
Because you didn't return my calls.

786
00:37:56,154 --> 00:38:00,123
And I wanted to see you.

787
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:02,892
And our daughter.

788
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,835
Any progress with the electrophotography?

789
00:38:11,837 --> 00:38:14,103
The satellite picture of
the city's still rendering.

790
00:38:15,841 --> 00:38:17,607
While we wait,

791
00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:19,209
care to tell me what's going on with you?

792
00:38:19,211 --> 00:38:20,577
What? Nothing.

793
00:38:21,947 --> 00:38:24,447
Two hunches in one day.

794
00:38:24,449 --> 00:38:26,282
Slick's locale,

795
00:38:26,284 --> 00:38:28,585
and that he'd be using a concussive bomb

796
00:38:28,587 --> 00:38:30,620
to thwart Barry.

797
00:38:30,622 --> 00:38:33,423
Do I need to inform you of
the odds of such a prediction?

798
00:38:35,393 --> 00:38:37,260
Something's happening to me.

799
00:38:37,262 --> 00:38:40,630
I'm starting to perceive things.

800
00:38:40,632 --> 00:38:42,298
Horrible things.

801
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:46,169
It started after Wells killed
me in the other timeline.

802
00:38:46,171 --> 00:38:49,939
It came back when Atom
Smasher attacked on Flash Day,

803
00:38:49,941 --> 00:38:53,142
and then again when Sand Demon showed up.

804
00:38:53,144 --> 00:38:55,378
I get a vibe,

805
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:59,616
and then a vision of something
that's already happened,

806
00:38:59,618 --> 00:39:01,417
and then it's gone.

807
00:39:03,588 --> 00:39:06,022
That's how I knew where Slick was.

808
00:39:06,024 --> 00:39:07,824
Cisco, this is amazing.

809
00:39:07,826 --> 00:39:10,426
We... we have to study this,
figure out just what to do.

810
00:39:10,428 --> 00:39:11,995
No, no, no, we're not doing any of that,

811
00:39:11,997 --> 00:39:13,663
and we're certainly not
telling anybody, either.

812
00:39:13,665 --> 00:39:15,865
Cisco, I would think you'd
be the one most intrigued

813
00:39:15,867 --> 00:39:18,167
with knowing exactly what
this is and how it works.

814
00:39:18,169 --> 00:39:20,770
I'm seeing things I don't want to see.

815
00:39:20,772 --> 00:39:22,171
And knowing things I don't want to know.

816
00:39:22,173 --> 00:39:23,873
I just want it to stop.

817
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:27,210
Professor, I don't want
anyone to know about this.

818
00:39:27,212 --> 00:39:28,511
Not yet.

819
00:39:32,884 --> 00:39:35,118
It's okay to be afraid, you know?

820
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,454
Wells told me this was my future.

821
00:39:38,456 --> 00:39:43,826
That he gave me this power.

822
00:39:43,828 --> 00:39:47,030
But everything he did was evil.

823
00:39:47,832 --> 00:39:50,500
That's what scares me, Professor.

824
00:39:50,502 --> 00:39:53,269
You have to promise me

825
00:39:53,271 --> 00:39:56,372
you won't tell anyone about this.

826
00:39:56,374 --> 00:39:58,841
I promise.

827
00:40:03,114 --> 00:40:04,580
Oh, wow.

828
00:40:06,618 --> 00:40:08,685
It appears that while
we were indeed successful

829
00:40:08,687 --> 00:40:10,053
in closing the singularity,

830
00:40:10,055 --> 00:40:12,588
there was an unfortunate side effect.

831
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:14,657
- What are you talking about?
- Using electrophotography,

832
00:40:14,659 --> 00:40:17,226
Cisco and I were able
to search Central City

833
00:40:17,228 --> 00:40:19,896
for any signs of energy entering our earth

834
00:40:19,898 --> 00:40:21,364
from another dimension.

835
00:40:21,366 --> 00:40:24,968
From any "breaches", as
Mr. Garrick described them.

836
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:27,937
But, of course, there
isn't just one breach.

837
00:40:27,939 --> 00:40:30,907
There's 52 of them scattered
throughout the city.

838
00:40:30,909 --> 00:40:33,676
These breaches are
pockets of time and space

839
00:40:33,678 --> 00:40:36,446
folded into and upon itself.

840
00:40:36,448 --> 00:40:39,615
But the most significant
breach of all appears to be

841
00:40:39,617 --> 00:40:41,050
this one.

842
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,488
And where exactly is that located?

843
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:48,624
It's here, inside S.T.A.R. Labs.

844
00:40:48,626 --> 00:40:51,227
And just beyond that breach

845
00:40:51,229 --> 00:40:54,431
is an entirely diff... fferent...

846
00:40:57,168 --> 00:40:59,068
Professor?

847
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:00,169
Professor!

848
00:41:09,014 --> 00:41:10,980
I'd like to personally welcome you

849
00:41:10,982 --> 00:41:12,915
to the Scientific and Technological

850
00:41:12,917 --> 00:41:14,784
Advanced Research Laboratories,

851
00:41:14,786 --> 00:41:17,453
or, as it's more commonly known,

852
00:41:17,455 --> 00:41:18,921
S.T.A.R. Labs.

853
00:41:18,923 --> 00:41:21,591
Founded in 1991, S.T.A.R. Labs is leading

854
00:41:21,593 --> 00:41:24,327
the world in exciting new
technological discoveries

855
00:41:24,329 --> 00:41:26,195
that, as our motto suggests,

856
00:41:26,197 --> 00:41:29,499
are truly bringing us
tomorrow's world today.

857
00:41:29,501 --> 00:41:32,068
Specializing in artificial intelligence,

858
00:41:32,070 --> 00:41:35,038
genetics, and meta-human stu...

859
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,409
Oh, are we in for an unexpected treat.

860
00:41:39,611 --> 00:41:43,146
It is my absolute honor to
introduce you to the founder

861
00:41:43,148 --> 00:41:44,747
of S.T.A.R. Labs,

862
00:41:44,749 --> 00:41:47,183
the savior of Central City,

863
00:41:47,185 --> 00:41:49,152
Dr. Harrison Wells.

864
00:41:56,528 --> 00:41:58,761
Hello, kids.
