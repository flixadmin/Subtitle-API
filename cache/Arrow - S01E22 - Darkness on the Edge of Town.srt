1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,049
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,682
For five years, I was stranded
on an island with only one goal...

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:10,686
...survive.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,525
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:17,163
Now I will fulfill my father's dying wish
to use the list of names he left me...

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,806
...and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,891
To do this,
I must become someone else.

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,089
I must become something else.

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,441
Previously on Arrow:

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,804
Rescuing your father and stopping Fyers
is not gonna be some walk in the park.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,287
- Yao Fei.
- Pa.

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,720
How did you escape?

13
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:39,805
I didn't.

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,640
You told me to stay away
from your family and I did.

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,083
But your family isn't staying away,
which means something must be done.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,047
You're going home.

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,242
About my mother and about
her involvement in the Undertaking.

18
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:00,129
She's working with Malcolm Merlyn,
and they're planning something terrible.

19
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:06,807
So I was wondering, there's a late
night happy hour at Stella's.

20
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,246
The place across the street.

21
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,410
You mean the place that's always
playing loud salsa music at all hours...

22
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,524
- ...when I'm trying to work late?
- That would be the one.

23
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,321
Anyway, I was thinking that, uh,
maybe, you know...

24
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,922
...if you wanted to,
we could perhaps grab a drink?

25
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:23,929
How about two?

26
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,568
Oh, my God!

27
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,361
Please, I did everything
Mr. Merlyn required of me.

28
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,406
He knows, Dr. Markov,
and he thanks you for your service.

29
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,885
- Open the door!
- Open the door!

30
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,282
- Open the...
- Freeze!

31
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,607
Open the door.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,287
- Open the door.
- Get down on the floor!

33
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:00,283
Open the door.

34
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:33,608
I've been watching your mother
for days now, Oliver, and nothing.

35
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,768
She goes to work, she comes home.
Occasionally she goes out to dinner.

36
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,850
She seems to particularly like
the salmon tartare at Table Salt.

37
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,327
I'm linked into her home and office
phone. Nothing out of the ordinary.

38
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,921
No mention of Walter's abduction
or the Undertaking.

39
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,205
- Just a few innocuous calls to Malcolm Merlyn.
- Why wouldn't she call him?

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,126
They're old friends.

41
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,041
We're all old friends.

42
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,727
Are you okay?

43
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,604
My mom and my best friend's dad
are involved in a conspiracy...

44
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,781
...that may have dire
consequences for the city.

45
00:03:05,806 --> 00:03:07,624
And I'm pretty sure they
murdered my father.

46
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,964
I'm not planning on using the word
okay again anytime soon.

47
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,040
Listen, all we know for
sure is that Malcolm and

48
00:03:14,047 --> 00:03:16,007
your mother are planning
something for the Glades.

49
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,941
And that Walter and I were
getting to close to it.

50
00:03:17,966 --> 00:03:19,287
That's why they had
him kidnapped.

51
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,362
We have to find out
what this Undertaking is.

52
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,244
I gotta ask her.

53
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,450
Well, no. The last time the vigilante
paid your mom a visit...

54
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,331
...you got shot,
and I got to play doctor with you.

55
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,961
Oh! My brain thinks of
the worst way to say things.

56
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,606
This time it'll just be me asking.

57
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,521
Friendly mother-son chat.

58
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,047
Laurel, what are you doing here?
It's not even 7 a.m.

59
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,489
That's just after closing time, right?

60
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,251
- How's business?
- Well, it's busy.

61
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,801
Busy. It was easier
when Tommy was running things.

62
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,805
- Tommy's a good guy.
- Yeah.

63
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,008
- Are you?
- What do you mean?

64
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:07,682
Last week, I told you
that I wanted to get back with Tommy.

65
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,330
That I needed you to go
to him and explain to

66
00:04:10,355 --> 00:04:12,910
him that you didn't still
have feelings for me.

67
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,248
But instead, you told me that you did.

68
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,571
As I'm sure you can probably imagine,
I haven't been able to think of much since.

69
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,046
- I shouldn't have said that.
- Then why did you?

70
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,248
I... I didn't have an agenda.

71
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,607
I didn't mean to make it more difficult
for you to fix things with Tommy.

72
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,731
But what if you did?

73
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,242
After you disappeared with Sara...

74
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,767
...I was sorry I ever knew you.

75
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,809
But now things have happened
that I never thought would.

76
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,046
You coming home.

77
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,289
My parents being in the same room.

78
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,761
And you.

79
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,929
What if I'm finally starting to see you
for who you really are?

80
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,571
- No...
- Maybe Tommy was right.

81
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:15,800
Maybe he and I weren't meant to be.
Maybe I'm finally ready to admit...

82
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,608
...that I still have feelings for you too.

83
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,765
Nothing's changed.
My life hasn't changed.

84
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,883
I haven't changed.

85
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,205
I gotta go. Walter's coming home.

86
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:49,964
Everything's exactly as you left it.

87
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,483
- How are you feeling, Walter?
- I'm on the mend, thank you, Oliver.

88
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,604
- Oh, I'm so glad you're home.
- That makes two of us.

89
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,404
All of us.

90
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,610
We've prepared a delicious brunch for you.
All your favorites.

91
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:04,683
Yum, English food.

92
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,049
Actually, I'm more tired
from the drive than I expected.

93
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,767
- So I think I'd like to lie down for a bit.
- Yes, of course.

94
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,243
Walter doesn't really seem like himself.

95
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,805
He's gone through a lot.
It's just gonna take a little bit of time.

96
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,523
I'm really sick of us all
having to go through a lot, you know?

97
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,524
Six scientists and three security personnel
are confirmed killed in the massacre.

98
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,809
Among the dead,
respected seismologist, Brian Markov.

99
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,442
A spokesperson for Unidac Industries
says a comment would be forthcoming.

100
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,007
- Mom, we need to talk.
- Oh, uh, later, Oliver.

101
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,885
...To co-workers, parents and families
of all the victims...

102
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,811
...to see how they're coping
with their loss.

103
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,206
You...

104
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,768
Save it. We don't have the luxury
of indulging in vendettas.

105
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,405
- Pa.
Shado.

106
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,927
You led Fyers right to us, you coward.

107
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,444
Fyers was about to fire bomb
the entire forest just to eliminate you.

108
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,483
This way, you all have a chance.

109
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,927
Pray I don't get the chance
to repay your mercy.

110
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,730
How fitting. Everyone reunited for the end.

111
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,651
The end of what? What is all this for?

112
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:04,085
HKIA, this is Ferris Air, Flight 637 out
of Berlin, nonstop to Hong Kong.

113
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,251
We are steady on approach at 33,000 feet
with winds at 15 knots.

114
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,602
ETA, two hours, 15 minutes, over.

115
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:17,007
Ferris 637, this is HKIA. Adjust course
to 0.6 degrees south, 11 minutes, over.

116
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,322
Roger, HKIA.
Why the course change?

117
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:23,531
Nothing to worry about, 637. Just looking
to make sure you avoid a little turbulence.

118
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,330
Roger that. Adjusting course now.

119
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,643
They're altering course. The plane
will be in range of Lian Yu in 26 minutes.

120
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,490
Good. Keep tracking it.

121
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,409
That's a commercial airliner, Fyers.

122
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,929
- It's not like it can land here.
- It won't be landing anywhere, Mr. Queen.

123
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,083
I'm going to destroy it.

124
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,489
Arrows are black, not green.
Copycat archer again.

125
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,331
Psychopaths are color-coding
themselves now. That's helpful.

126
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,568
Yeah, except we haven't seen
the copycat in quite a while.

127
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,121
Ok, last time he took hostages
to draw out the vigilante.

128
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,369
This time,
he massacres a bunch of lab nerds?

129
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,291
Want a press lockdown.
Nobody hears about the other archer.

130
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,404
We beed to get a list of all Unidac employees
and find out what they're working on here.

131
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,687
Apparently it was a tight group.

132
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,201
Anyone who knows anything
about the project is dead.

133
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,960
The copycat fried all their computers
and burned their research.

134
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,686
Ah. Whatever's going on here, someone
doesn't want anyone to know about it.

135
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,684
Where did you even get that camera?

136
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,201
Come to think of it,
where did you get this car?

137
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,244
I borrowed it, illegally.

138
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,407
When I imagined being in a car with you,
this isn't exactly what I had in mind.

139
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,728
Well, you were the one who said
you'd help me find the vigilante.

140
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,724
I know, but it's been two weeks.

141
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,406
And the closest we've come
is snapping photos of the cop...

142
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,126
...who hates the Hood
just as much as you worship him.

143
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:44,891
- I don't worship him. I just need to find him.
- You don't need to find him to be somebody.

144
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,569
Besides, it's not like
you're gonna meet him any time soon.

145
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,883
Seems like the cops don't have a clue.

146
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,410
We don't know what they know.

147
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,643
- Okay, I officially do not like that look.
- You still work at CNRI, right?

148
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,245
Hey, Mom.

149
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,041
Walter's upstairs resting.
I think he's doing well, don't you?

150
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,005
- Who took him?
- Well, we don't know yet.

151
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:22,483
But I'm gonna make sure all the resources
of Queen Consolidated are behind it.

152
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,491
That's the answer
that you gave to reporters yesterday.

153
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,001
Tell me the truth.

154
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,321
- I don't know what you mean.
- I think you do.

155
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,403
Couple months ago,
when I showed you dad's notebook...

156
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:38,127
...you seemed to know something.
Something about our family being in danger.

157
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,485
Are you suggesting that I knew
something about my husband's kidnapping?

158
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,284
I'm just suggesting that
maybe you were scared.

159
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,245
That maybe you didn't mean
for any of this to happen, but...

160
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,525
It was harder than you thought and now
you're barely keeping your head above water.

161
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:56,809
Please, Mom.
Let me help you before you drown.

162
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,484
You need to stop asking these things.
Do you understand? I need you to stop.

163
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,960
I can't.

164
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,170
I need to know.

165
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,131
- Is that a power outage?
- I don't know.

166
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,240
Oliver. Oliver.

167
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,804
Mom.

168
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,365
Oliver.

169
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,324
- Are you okay?
- Oliver?

170
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,171
What...? We...

171
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,766
- Oh, we've gotta get out of here.
- Moira Queen...

172
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,329
...you have failed this city.

173
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,370
This doesn't make any sense.
Why do you want to blow up a plane?

174
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,609
When the New York Stock
Exchange reopened after 9/11

175
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,566
...the Dow Jones dropped
nearly 685 points.

176
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,162
Can you imagine what would happen to China,
the world's second largest economy...

177
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,807
...if all air travel in and out of China
were to be grounded indefinitely.

178
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,646
You want to destabilize China's economy?

179
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,168
It's not what I want,
but rather my employer.

180
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,922
We have enough missiles here to shoot down
any aircraft approaching the mainland.

181
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,124
And that will decimate China's economy.
Especially...

182
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:32,491
...once a rogue element in China's
own military claims responsibility.

183
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,811
You see, inconvenient
though you occasionally were...

184
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,725
...you're always worth more to me alive
than dead.

185
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,447
Then you should have killed me,
because I won't do it.

186
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,043
Really?

187
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,642
Shado. Shado.

188
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:59,368
I said I need you alive,
but I can kill everyone you care about.

189
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,764
Help you with something?

190
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:16,330
Yes, urn, I'm from CNRI and we're investigating
claims of racial bias in SCPD arrests.

191
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,524
So I'm gonna need a copy of each file
from every arrest...

192
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,361
...in Starling City
January, 2011 to present.

193
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,526
- It's almost 9 at night.
- Tell that to Judge Crow.

194
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,802
He's the one who signed the court order.

195
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,765
Wait here.

196
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,351
I don't know, it seems
like a bit of a leap.

197
00:13:36,376 --> 00:13:38,515
Yeah, which is what you
do when you got nothing...

198
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,401
...because all I know is the copycat,
he torched every record down at Unidac.

199
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,002
And all we got are phone records
and they show that this Markov guy...

200
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,841
...he made a couple of calls to
an unclaimed line at Merlyn Global.

201
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:52,891
A couple of calls? Did I say "reach"?
I misspoke. I meant "leap."

202
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,921
Just get someone down here from Merlyn
Global to answer a few questions under oath.

203
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,885
- Did you find anything?
- Lots.

204
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,122
- Anything helpful?
- No, still looking.

205
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,921
What about you?
You learn anything from the cops?

206
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,124
- As a matter of fact.
- I like the sound of that.

207
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,607
- You know that copycat archer?
- Yeah.

208
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,849
Turns out he's connected
to Merlyn Global somehow.

209
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,730
Or at least his victims are.

210
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,327
We're looking for the Hood,
not some crazy wannabe.

211
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:26,844
Well, the guy with the black arrows seems to
hate the guy with the green arrows, so...

212
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,681
So what, we just show up at Merlyn Global
and hope the Hood shows up too?

213
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,609
Last I checked,
you don't have any better ideas.

214
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,969
Please.

215
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,684
Do not hurt my son.

216
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,691
Tell me what
the Undertaking is and I won't have to.

217
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,362
- No!
- Tell me!

218
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,407
Please, leave my son alone.

219
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,286
- What is Malcolm Merlyn planning?
- I can't tell you.

220
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,651
He'll kill me, he'll kill my family.

221
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,690
You should be
more worried about what I'll do.

222
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:12,765
No! Malcolm is planning
to level the Glades.

223
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,327
He said so he could rebuild it but...

224
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,328
- How?
- There's a device.

225
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,451
- What device?
- He says that it can cause an earthquake.

226
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,484
- How is this possible?
- I don't know.

227
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,929
It was invented by Unidac Industries.

228
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:35,485
Malcolm used
my company's applied sciences...

229
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,046
...to turn it into a weapon.

230
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,644
Why would you get involved
in something like this?

231
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,045
My husband...

232
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,929
He got involved without my knowing.
He was just trying to do some good.

233
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,885
He was lost. He...

234
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,244
His decisions left me vulnerable to Malcolm
and I had no choice.

235
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,205
I had to protect my family and my children.

236
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,205
This device, where is it?

237
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,046
- I don't know.
- If you don't tell me, I can't stop Merlyn.

238
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,004
Oh, you can't stop him.

239
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,846
It's too late.

240
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,849
No, no, no, I told you everything!

241
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,722
- Oliver. No. Oh, sweet...
- Don't.

242
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,846
Please, I know what you must be thinking,
sweetheart...

243
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,202
...but I never intended
any of this to happen.

244
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,806
You know I would never willingly be a part
of anything like this.

245
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,402
I don't know anything anymore.

246
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,971
Oh, my God. You said you were
gonna pull your punches.

247
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,642
- I did.
- Let me get you an icepack for everything.

248
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,450
I'm fine.

249
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,808
I need you to dig up everything you can
on Unidac Industries.

250
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,083
Well, we know Queen Consolidated
acquired them seven months ago.

251
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,731
That's when we met.

252
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,241
I need information about what I don't know.

253
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,764
Unidac is a small research
and development technology company...

254
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,361
...that specializes in
seismic infringement.

255
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:41,482
Merlyn plans on leveling the Glades with a
device that triggers a manmade earthquake.

256
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,929
You're kidding.

257
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,003
What else does it say?

258
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,168
More information on the stock auction...

259
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,489
...and you know the latest,
what the media's calling...

260
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,809
- The Unidac massacre.
- There's no way this timing is a coincidence.

261
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,686
Oliver, there's a website claiming
the police suspect a copycat archer.

262
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,087
- What?
- So the other archer works for Merlyn?

263
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,371
He's tying up loose ends.

264
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,969
Erasing all evidence this device exists so no
one can trace the devastation back to him.

265
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,437
Alright, so you're gonna have a
poignant conversation with Mr. Merlyn.

266
00:18:10,462 --> 00:18:11,783
Well, even if I
take out Merlyn...

267
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:15,327
...the other archer is still there. He can
set off the device. We need to find it.

268
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,806
Then Merlyn can get his.

269
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,480
Well, maybe there's another way
to get Merlyn to tell us.

270
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,489
What do you have in mind?

271
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,160
As I keep proving, people keep secrets...

272
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,686
...computers don't.

273
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,123
Felicity, are you hacking
into the Merlyn Global mainframe?

274
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:33,166
Hacking is such an ugly word. No. I'm...

275
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,520
Yeah, totally hacking
into the Merlyn Global mainframe.

276
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,970
Stop! I'll do it.

277
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,640
I knew your good judgment
could be counted on.

278
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,764
Come along now.
We need to get you back into uniform.

279
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,729
- It's Fyers. It's happening.
- Understood.

280
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,361
That was Fyers.
Everything is proceeding to your plan.

281
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,002
It truly is very kind of you
to come all the way out here.

282
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,964
Walter?

283
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,485
Who are you speaking to?

284
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,002
- Moira. How are you?
- Well. Thank you.

285
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:42,285
- Actually, you look a little bit out of sorts.
- Oh, no, no, I'm fine.

286
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,766
Malcolm stopped by
to check up on his nemesis.

287
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,765
On the racquetball court.

288
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,046
I didn't get a chance to talk
to Walter at the hospital.

289
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,005
Like everyone,
I'm glad he's back where he belongs.

290
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,247
With his family.

291
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,010
Yes.

292
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,720
I'll let you get some rest.

293
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,445
- Thanks again.
- Yeah.

294
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,160
Uh, I'll walk you out.

295
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,562
Your assassin wasn't too subtle
in eliminating those people at Unidac.

296
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,921
And now the Police are focused on the
copycat archer instead of the Undertaking.

297
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,651
As for our collateral damage,
I had to limit our exposure.

298
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,811
I see. And does paying Walter a visit
just now fall under the same category?

299
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,287
You held him for nearly six months.

300
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,807
- Surely you had him questioned.
- He was.

301
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,641
And I assume that if Walter knew something
you'd rather he didn't, agreement be damned...

302
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,810
...I would be a widow again. Am I wrong?

303
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,609
Rarely.

304
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,123
Well, we discovered a few phone calls...

305
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,086
...between one of the Unidac victims
and someone at the Merlyn Global group.

306
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,080
Which is why I asked for someone at your
company to help me with my investigation.

307
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:54,487
But naturally, they send
down the one guy...

308
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:58,162
...that's been working there 30 seconds
and knows nothing.

309
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,041
Detective Lance, if someone from Merlyn
Global is involved with those deaths...

310
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,487
- ...I want them found as much as you do.
- Yeah.

311
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:09,368
Give me more to go on than some phone calls
and I will help you in any way that I can.

312
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,289
Thank you.

313
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,205
Hey-

314
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:20,246
- What are you doing here?
- Helping your father with an investigation.

315
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,451
Uh...

316
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:28,567
- Call me if you need anything else.
- Thank you.

317
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,890
One second, sweetie.

318
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,527
Okay, someone at Merlyn Global
could be connected to the copycat archer.

319
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,008
Alright? Any chance you can have a little
snoop around their computer systems?

320
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:44,364
- We'll need a warrant.
- No, we'll need a judge who owes me a favor.

321
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,611
Hey-

322
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,365
You never did tell me
what had you and Merlyn on the outs.

323
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:55,805
- No, I didn't.
- You don't have to tell me.

324
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,367
Oliver.

325
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,003
- Come on.
- I know.

326
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,611
I know. Say it.

327
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:06,647
You think I'm crazy.

328
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,090
I mean, Oliver, he cheated on me, he broke
my heart, he led Sara to her death...

329
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,444
...and you would probably rather drink acid
than see me with him again.

330
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:19,321
Dad, I am sure you're disappointed in me.

331
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,684
Since Queen's been back, he's different.

332
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,521
I'll deny ever having said that.

333
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,040
Let's eat.

334
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,565
- Ah.
- Anything?

335
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,407
Just for the record, I will pump my fist
in the air and scream "yes" if I get in.

336
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:57,081
- You know, you can just say this isn't working.
- This isn't working.

337
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,089
Alright, there has to be some other way we can
find out where he is keeping this device.

338
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,807
Unless I can waltz up to Merlyn's mainframe
and plug in my tablet directly...

339
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,970
- ...there's no way of getting that location.
- Then we waltz.

340
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,764
Excuse me?

341
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:11,248
You need direct access to the mainframe, so
we get you direct access to the mainframe...

342
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,683
- ...and figure out where the device is being kept.
- Oliver...

343
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,201
...I did mention that the mainframe
is located...

344
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,688
...inside Merlyn Global Group's
main headquarters, on the 25th floor?

345
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,646
- It's only accessible through a restricted access elevator.
- I know.

346
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,201
We're gonna have to break in.

347
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,962
Hi. Oliver Queen.
I have an 11:30 with Tommy Merlyn.

348
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,285
I have a super deluxe Big Belly Buster
for a Mr. Andrews.

349
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,244
I think he's in security.

350
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,409
- He a good tipper?
- You can go on up, Mr. Queen.

351
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,285
You can wait a second.

352
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,689
- New guy, you order food?
- Yeah, I'm addicted to Big Belly Burger.

353
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,049
- Never had it.
- I'll split it with you.

354
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,166
Keep the change.

355
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,806
Hold that.

356
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,642
- Where you heading, sweetie?
- Nineteenth floor.

357
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,287
Too bad, I'm going to 13th. Damn it!

358
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,204
Mr. Andrews got his lunch?

359
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,165
One Belly Buster with benzodiazepine.
Hold the mayo.

360
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,964
Sleep tight.

361
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,891
Mainframe's on 25, guys.
This is as close as I can get you.

362
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,884
- Don't look down.
- Too late.

363
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,641
I should mention I'm afraid of heights,
which I just learned.

364
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,006
- Felicity. Hold on to me tight.
- Huh?

365
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,204
I imagined you saying that
under different circumstances.

366
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:54,001
Very platonic circumstances.

367
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,490
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.

368
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,448
Come on.

369
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,880
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

370
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:31,085
Yeah, this is just my about-to-hack face.
I always...

371
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,204
...oh, look like this right before I,
you know, hack.

372
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,283
Security patrol's on a 10-minute cycle.

373
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,847
I'll have my meeting with Tommy
and be back in nine.

374
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,724
Okay.

375
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,285
Okay.

376
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,724
Dig, you got eyes on her?

377
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,447
Five by five.

378
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,207
Okay.

379
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,007
Sure beats the back of a bar.

380
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,730
I saw your name in my schedule.
I thought it must be a typo.

381
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:20,687
Why so serious?

382
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:24,970
Did someone decide that they didn't
want you putting an arrow in them today?

383
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,124
- I thought it was past time we talked.
- About what?

384
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,325
Me leaving the club, you being a serial
killer? We're not lacking for topics.

385
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,444
Let's start with Laurel,
since you're still in love with her.

386
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,247
So are you.

387
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,329
I can't be with her, Tommy.

388
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,364
- You know why I can't.
- So what?

389
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:49,090
- I'm her consolation prize? I'll pass.
- She's not anyone's property.

390
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,005
Laurel makes her own decisions...

391
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,362
...and she chose you.

392
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,040
Until you couldn't handle it.

393
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,969
Lord knows I am guilty
of a lot of things between us...

394
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,969
...but not you and her.

395
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,484
That's all I came to say.

396
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,884
What exactly do you do here?

397
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,482
I work closely with my father.

398
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,530
- Guys, you got trouble.
- What?

399
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,921
Felicity's about to have some
ahead of schedule company.

400
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,324
- I'm not there yet on the download.
- Hold tight. I am on my way.

401
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,601
Oliver.

402
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,843
- Mr. Merlyn.
- I must say, I'm surprised to see you here.

403
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,048
Tommy and I just had
a little unfinished business.

404
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,123
Ah. I know things have
been challenging between

405
00:28:55,148 --> 00:28:57,030
you two, but I trust
you're working things out.

406
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,043
- Felicity.
- Just a few more seconds.

407
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,322
Yes. I'm sorry, I have to go.

408
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,602
There are some investors waiting for me
at my club.

409
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,287
I'm heading out to a meeting myself.
I'll walk you down to the lobby.

410
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,206
She's gonna get made, Oliver.

411
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,969
Oliver, did you hear me?

412
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,086
- Felicity.
- What? Just a few more seconds.

413
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,363
- Come on, come on.
- You don't have a few more seconds.

414
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,767
Yes. Wow, I really do do that.

415
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,687
- Oh.
- Dammit Oliver, she's in trouble. Where are you?

416
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,160
This is a restricted area.

417
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,971
Let's see some ID.

418
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,605
ID? Uh...

419
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:51,284
- Tell your mother I said hello.
- I will.

420
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,170
- Got held up. Heading back upstairs.
- Ollie?

421
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,204
- Thea? What are you doing here?
- I, uh, just saw Tommy.

422
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,444
Yeah, me too. I'm gonna run back up.
I don't wanna be late.

423
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,961
Oh, I thought you just came down.

424
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,127
There you are. Thanks a lot, man,
this one snuck past security.

425
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,244
One of Merlyn junior's bimbos.
She's pissed he never called her back.

426
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,728
- Copy that. I read the tabloids.
- Yeah. Thanks again.

427
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,804
Let's go, Barbie.
Your new last name ain't gonna be Merlyn.

428
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,765
But I love him. He's my man.

429
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,042
Ha, ha.
You're my knight in shining armor.

430
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,402
Is that your friend Roy?

431
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,244
- No. Uh...
- No?

432
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,408
Yeah, he gave me a ride.

433
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,728
Thea, what are you really doing here?
The truth, please.

434
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,649
- The truth? Uh...
- Mm-hm.

435
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,360
- We're trying to find the vigilante.
- What?

436
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:52,007
Roy's been kind of obsessed with him
since he saved his life at the subway.

437
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,686
And I overheard Detective Lance
saying the other archer...

438
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,360
...was connected to Merlyn Global, some...
Hey.

439
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,281
Roy. We haven't met.
I'm Thea's disapproving older brother.

440
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,847
Yeah, I know. Good to meet you.

441
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,810
Don't mess around with the Hood.

442
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,447
He's a psychopath. He's dangerous.
Anyone who gets near him winds up dead.

443
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,160
That will not be my sister, do you hear me?

444
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,685
Okay.

445
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,243
Take her home now.

446
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,850
What are you doing?

447
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,247
The Vigilante's not too fond
of guys who sell Vertigo.

448
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,807
I know a guy who claims
he still has a stash to sell.

449
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,010
Maybe we could stake him out,
hope the Hood shows up for him.

450
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:45,727
- Did you not hear what my brother said?
- What does your brother know about him?

451
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,089
Uh, for one thing,
the vigilante once saved his life...

452
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,363
...so if he's telling us to keep away
that should say something.

453
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,403
No offense, but your
brother's kind of a wimp.

454
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,849
- Don't say that.
- Why not? It's true.

455
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,089
My brother survived five years alone
on an island.

456
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:06,889
- Five years I thought I had lost him.
- Yeah? Well, I lost someone too.

457
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:10,527
- And they aren't coming back.
- Who?

458
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,930
It doesn't matter.

459
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,011
That is why I need to find him.
So he can teach me to be like him.

460
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,130
I'm not losing anyone else ever again.

461
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,329
I can't do this, Roy.

462
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,569
If you don't give this up,
you're gonna lose me.

463
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,251
Better now than later.

464
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,770
Oh, good. I was just coming to check on you
to see if maybe you'd like some tea or...

465
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,241
What is this?

466
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,803
Walter...

467
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,290
...please.

468
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,403
Divorce is an extreme reaction.

469
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,649
Well, considering the circumstances,
I find it somewhat reserved.

470
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,810
Or do you think I believe that
my abduction on the night you told me...

471
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:11,250
...that I was getting too close
to your conspiracy was a coincidence?

472
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,287
No, you were in danger.
This arrangement, it saved your life.

473
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:21,084
Well, that's ironic.
Because it feels like you've destroyed it.

474
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,361
- Walter.
- You know...

475
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,285
...I read about people in forced captivity.

476
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:30,481
Some of them said it was a simple thought
that got them through the isolation and fear.

477
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,806
Returning to their loved ones.

478
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,404
So I don't know really why I'm still alive,
Moira, because I didn't have that.

479
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,681
Walter, please...

480
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:43,407
What do you think you can say to me
to convince me that everything I knew...

481
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,683
...my whole life, hasn't just evaporated?

482
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,569
Where are you going?

483
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,730
Come here.

484
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:15,684
Detective?

485
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,527
What did you find?

486
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,530
Merlyn Global's cyber security
is off the charts.

487
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,405
Firewalls, NSA-grade, lPSec protocols.

488
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,887
What's that, tech speak for,
"I struck out, boss"?

489
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,088
Yeah, but I wasn't the only one.

490
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,931
Somebody else tried hacking
into Merlyn Global systems.

491
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,930
Same pathways I used, same result.

492
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:37,249
You're saying someone was looking
for Merlyn's connection to Unidac?

493
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,125
Someone good. Knew how to
reverse engineer her footprints.

494
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:42,089
- I almost didn't catch her.
- Her?

495
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,409
Yeah. She works at Queen Consolidated.
Name's Felicity Smoak.

496
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,202
Who the hell is Felicity Smoak?

497
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,965
In addition to the download...

498
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,050
...I also took the liberty of uploading
a Trojan to Merlyn's system.

499
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,607
- Figured it might come in handy.
- That's smart.

500
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,690
If Merlyn thinks he's been compromised,
it'll help if we know first.

501
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,406
- Can you locate the seismic device?
- I'm working on it.

502
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,649
But there's at least a teraflop
of data to go through.

503
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,404
You all right?

504
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,527
My father, he told me
that he failed the city.

505
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,960
Asked me to right his wrongs,
but I never knew what he meant until now.

506
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,640
It's the Undertaking.

507
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:28,924
I promised myself that when I crossed all
these names off the list, I'd be done...

508
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,924
...but taking down these people,
it doesn't honor him.

509
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:38,129
I was just treating the symptoms
while the disease festered.

510
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,931
I stop the Undertaking...

511
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,803
...I wipe out the disease.

512
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,004
What are you saying, Oliver?
You would hang up the Hood?

513
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:53,247
Merlyn's plan is what I returned
from the island to stop.

514
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,009
- Where are you going?
- Out.

515
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,451
Hi. Can we talk?

516
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,842
What do you wanna talk about?

517
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:22,207
Wow, I thought this was gonna
be easier to say.

518
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,964
But now I'm standing here...

519
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,722
- ...looking at you and it's...
- Just say what you have to say and go, ok?

520
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,203
Ever since I've been back,
we've been doing this dance.

521
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,483
We come together, and then I pull away.

522
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,523
Something pulls me away.

523
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,244
But I think, finally...

524
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,890
...that something might be over.

525
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:57,843
- What are you trying to say?
- That you know me better than anyone.

526
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:04,809
And that you are more important to me
than anyone.

527
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,451
I just hope I didn't
wait too long to say it.

528
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,929
You didn't wait too long.

529
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,082
You're right on time.

530
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,840
- What is it?
- Felicity found the Markov device.

531
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:24,084
Merlyn's keeping it at a warehouse
his company owns in the Glades.

532
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,120
Good. Coordinate an attack.
You take the device, I'll take Merlyn.

533
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,767
- Got a location?
- Yeah.

534
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,806
According to Felicity's Trojan, Merlyn's
logged on to his computer from his office.

535
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,883
I'm on my way.

536
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,530
The uniform suits you, Yao Fei.

537
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,929
Any time you're ready.

538
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,530
To the people of China
and citizens of the world...

539
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:53,527
...I make this statement voluntarily,
taking responsibility for the shooting...

540
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,411
...of Ferris Air flight 637...

541
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,610
...to protest the People's
Republic of China's treatment of me...

542
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,690
...for betraying and abandoning me
to the island of Lian Yu.

543
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,285
Consider this my righteous delivery
of powerful vengeance.

544
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,966
Thank you.

545
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,321
- No!
- Pa!

546
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,287
Pa!

547
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,562
Sir, the plane is within range.

548
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,405
Very well. I'll be in touch.

549
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:58,809
Can I help you?

550
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,690
No.

551
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,129
I wasn't talking to you.

552
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,561
Malcolm Merlyn...

553
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,929
...you have failed this city.

554
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:16,603
- And how have I done that?
- The Undertaking. It ends now.

555
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,404
Oliver, the device...

556
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,484
...it's gone.

557
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:25,130
Where's the device?

558
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:29,484
Safe. I don't know how you got that Trojan
onto my system...

559
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,644
...but it prompted me
to take precautions.

560
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,971
There is nothing you can do to stop
what is about to happen.

561
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:39,850
And you shouldn't.

562
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:44,324
This city needs what is about to happen
in order to survive.

563
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:48,844
The people who are destroying it from
the inside need to be erased from the map.

564
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,931
Fine. Let's start with you.

565
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:00,285
Ironic, isn't it?
Last Christmas, I almost killed you.

566
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:05,448
A few months ago, you saved my life.
And now you're here trying to kill me.

567
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,041
- You should make up your mind.
- Done.

568
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,361
Oh, no.
