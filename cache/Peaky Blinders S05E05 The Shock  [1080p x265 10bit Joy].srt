1
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,640
Clear that shit.
Clear it.

2
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,840
All right. Take her.

3
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,200
Shit!

4
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,800
Outside. Till it's done.
Till it's done, brother.

5
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,440
Easy. Easy!

6
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,360
Linda!

7
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,120
I would've taken your bullet.

8
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,120
I deserve the bullet.

9
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,880
An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth!

10
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,360
Linda! Linda, look at me.

11
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,280
Linda, you've got a kid.

12
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:04,840
If you die, he'll come to us to raise.

13
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,800
You hear me?

14
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,120
I used a Derringer.

15
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,160
-All right.

16
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,360
It's still in there, right above the bone.

17
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,600
Mr Shelby, your guests...

18
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,920
Get him out. Arthur. Family only!

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,920
Get him out!

20
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,720
-Mr Shelby, on your behalf--
-Get out!

21
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:26,480
-Get out!

22
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,480
Lizzie, go to the kitchen,
get some iodine.

23
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,400
Now! Go!

24
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,400
All right.

25
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,720
-Linda. You'll have to bite on this.

26
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,760
Linda. Arthur.

27
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,360
Bite! Come here.

28
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,200
All right.
Now it's really going to hurt.

29
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,680
-One, two, three.

30
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,000
All right. All right.

31
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,720
-All right. Almost there.
- Hold her.

32
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,520
Is she going
to be all right, Tom?

33
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,160
Is she going to be all right, Tom?

34
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,520
- Yeah.

35
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,560
Oh, Jesus.

36
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,600
Arthur, come here. Come here.

37
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,760
If you love her, go to the library,
get some opium.

38
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,640
Go on. She'll be fine. Go, soldier.

39
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,560
Right.

40
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,480
Actually, you can use mine.

41
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,080
Brought a bit to celebrate
the wedding proposal.

42
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,040
Oh!

43
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,280
He proposed, eh?

44
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,000
One knee.

45
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,640
Congratulations, Pol.

46
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,960
Linda. Linda.

47
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,960
You'll have to drink this.

48
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,080
-No, I don't want anything you've touched.
-Twenty-five seconds.

49
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,080
Twenty-five seconds
and the pain will be gone.

50
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,520
Even the pain in your head.

51
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,920
All right, here you go. Drink.

52
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,360
Cushion, Pol.

53
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,400
All right.

54
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,920
- Never again.

55
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,360
Jesus Christ!

56
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,760
Arthur.

57
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,440
She's going to be fine.

58
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,160
I gave her something to get her to sleep.
She's going to be fine.

59
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,480
You should have...

60
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,680
You should have let her do it, Pol.

61
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,280
You should have let her do it.

62
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,680
Arthur, come on.

63
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,640
-You should have let her do it.
-Look at me, brother!

64
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,760
Look at me.

65
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,960
You got things to do.

66
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,800
-You've got a kid.
-Yeah.

67
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,760
We need you. All right?

68
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,280
-You understand?
-Yeah.

69
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,680
Aberama wants you as best man.

70
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,520
You hear that?

71
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,480
I save his life, he hugs him.

72
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,000
Oh.

73
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,920
I'll do it.

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'll take it.

75
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,000
Right, fine. Let him be. Let him be.

76
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,279
Oh.

77
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,000
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

78
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,040
Ladies and gentlemen.

79
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,160
I would like to extend our gratitude

80
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:38,440
to the musicians and the dance company
for your wonderful performance.

81
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,280
This has been a wonderful evening.

82
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,200
Yes, it has.

83
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,960
And not only for the music
and the dancing.

84
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,800
It has also been about us,
the people gathered here.

85
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,160
English people
in the very heart of England.

86
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,120
There are no people
I would rather be among,

87
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:04,120
no place I would rather be
and no time I would rather be alive.

88
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,040
Well said!

89
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,480
Because ever since
the terrible events of October,

90
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,240
when the money markets betrayed us all...

91
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,160
Disgrace!

92
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:15,040
...I have known that change is coming.

93
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:24,040
The human species has never faced
such immense possibilities, such choices.

94
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,840
In the lives of great nations,

95
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,400
there are moments of destiny

96
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,680
which have swept aside
small men of convention

97
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:39,720
and discovered men of the moment.

98
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,600
-And our host...
- Yes.

99
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,120
...is such a man.

100
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,960
For him...

101
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,760
For him, the little calculations
of little men mean nothing.

102
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,520
He is a man well suited to the mighty mood
that England is now in.

103
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,120
Hear, hear.

104
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:06,520
The only reason I say this now,
at this moment on this stage,

105
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,520
is because I have some news.

106
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,880
Good news, I think.

107
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,560
I'm sure our host will forgive me
if I use this platform,

108
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:23,400
this gathering of friends and like minds,
to give you, his trusted allies,

109
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,400
an early announcement
of a long-overdue event.

110
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,920
I want to tell you good folk first

111
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,160
that with the dawn of a new decade,

112
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,880
I will be setting a new course,

113
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,800
setting up a new political movement

114
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,200
-here in the very heart of England.

115
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,600
And Mr Shelby will be with me,
shoulder to shoulder.

116
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,840
It will offer a new conception of politics

117
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,080
in which the great character
of the British, our true character,

118
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,880
will be reborn.

119
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,520
Many of you lost fortunes
in the recent stock market crash.

120
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,800
The men of money,

121
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,000
the capitalists in New York,

122
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,160
the Jews,

123
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,440
the money-power, they...

124
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,080
They run an international system
in which the infinite mobility of money,

125
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,240
its capacity to create
financial chaos and panic,

126
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,800
can bring down any government that dares,
for one moment, to oppose it.

127
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,480
For generations, the efforts
of hardworking men like you

128
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,480
have equipped our competitors against us.

129
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:46,840
The cotton mills of India,
the cotton mills of Asia,

130
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,360
created with British money

131
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:53,120
but used for the destruction
of Lancashire and Yorkshire.

132
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,840
-Disgraceful.
- The usurers of New York,

133
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,040
the sweated labour of the Orient,

134
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,000
combining to destroy
the iron and steel factories

135
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,440
of Warwickshire and Staffordshire.

136
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,920
These are policies that could not
be pursued by British statesmen

137
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,240
unless they were mad
or the servants of Jewish finance.

138
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,120
Right words. I second that.

139
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,480
They are the ones who took your money,

140
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,680
but it is I and those who know this truth

141
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,560
who will light a flame
the atheists cannot extinguish.

142
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,520
The ranks of our heroes of the Great War

143
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,919
have been betrayed again and again
by politicians!

144
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:49,800
<i>But hear this, those of you</i>
<i>who fought the Jew war for nothing, </i>

145
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,560
<i>you brave men, </i>

146
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,960
you will join hands with the angry youth
of Birmingham and Manchester

147
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,120
and London and Liverpool

148
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,600
and declare that England lives tonight
and marches on!

149
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,760
Yes, yes!

150
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,480
Well said!

151
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,640
I say all this to you now

152
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,240
because I believe it is
in places like this with people like you

153
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,800
that we will have to pass on
our message directly.

154
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,360
Our message can be summarised
with these words:

155
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,560
"Britain first."

156
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,000
As it should be!

157
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,080
And because this is our message,

158
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:33,560
I doubt it'll be reported fairly
in the press.

159
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,040
I'm afraid the newspapers of this country

160
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,080
are owned by the same vested interests
who took your money.

161
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,960
They sell to the people false news

162
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,200
to raise the interests of the faction

163
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,160
and the section above
the interests of the nation.

164
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,320
Good man.

165
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:57,760
So hear my words and pass them on
to those with ears to hear,

166
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,400
and be reminded
that when the new decade begins,

167
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,760
there will be the birth of a new
political party which will speak for you!

168
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,400
Yes! At last.

169
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:17,120
This party, this new movement,
this revolution

170
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,320
will be called
the British Union of Fascists.

171
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,520
Well said!

172
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,520
What the fuck are you doing
dealing with a man like that, Tommy?

173
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,000
Yeah... You're going to have to trust me.

174
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,680
Again.

175
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm going to fuck the Swan.

176
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,440
Somebody go and tell her
to come to my room.

177
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,880
How do you know she'll come?

178
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,400
Because they always do.

179
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:22,480
Now, forgive me. I'm going to borrow
your husband for a little while.

180
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,800
This way.

181
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,000
<i>Things like tonight,</i>

182
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,480
that shooting, a family dispute in public,

183
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,160
things like that will have to stop.

184
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,520
It's very lower-class.

185
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,240
It's all been cleared up, Mr Mosley.

186
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,280
So, did you learn anything
from my speech tonight?

187
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,080
Yes.

188
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,440
Yes, I learned many things.

189
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,200
Religion was a beast,
but it's dead.

190
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,320
You have to ride the new thing
when it comes.

191
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,320
Like a horse.

192
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,440
You grab it.

193
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,520
I looked into the audience
and I saw medals

194
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,960
and Savile Row suits and bitterness.

195
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,040
They are my people.
Your people will be different.

196
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,320
Oh, do see the funny side, Shelby.

197
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:29,960
I do.

198
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,440
I do see the funny side.

199
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,760
Do you enjoy strategies?

200
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,680
Yes, I do.

201
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,560
Things will begin to happen now.

202
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,040
So...

203
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,760
there are some things we need to discuss.

204
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,720
I have been looking into your companies.

205
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,800
The Shelby portfolio.

206
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,400
Your company lawyer is a Jew.

207
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,760
He will have to go.

208
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,360
-Of course.
-Also,

209
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,360
our friend, Jimmy McCavern,

210
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,240
has asked for control of the racecourses
north of Wincanton.

211
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,920
I decided it is a trifling thing,
considering our new enterprise,

212
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,680
so I said yes.

213
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,200
In return for what?

214
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,200
No return.

215
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,600
None.

216
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,840
When our campaign begins,

217
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,600
the country will be divided
into distinct areas.

218
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,320
McCavern and his men
will be our soldiers in the north,

219
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,200
controlling rallies
and breaking up demonstrations.

220
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,040
In the midlands, it'll be you.

221
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,480
The south, well...

222
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,040
I have yet to decide.

223
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,400
Please understand what I'm offering you
as we go forward, Mr Shelby.

224
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,440
When we succeed,

225
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,120
even the king will not be above us.

226
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,880
Power.

227
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,720
Like plugging into the mains.

228
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,400
A lighthouse beam.

229
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:21,440
Your millions of dollars
safe in Switzerland,

230
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,680
and access to every dirty-minded Swan
in England.

231
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,160
Hmm.

232
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,440
Oh, and also, Shelby,

233
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,520
drink less.

234
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,240

244
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,320
The ballerina and I were wondering
whether perhaps

245
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,480
you might want to join us.

246
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,400
If I told Tommy,
you wouldn't see the morning.

247
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,480
I doubt that very much.

248
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,080
You see, he has been seduced,
just as you were.

249
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,760
Tommy.

250
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,400
Tommy.

251
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,640
Tom!

252
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,920
What...

253
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,680
Lizzie?

254
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,480
What?

255
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,880
Tommy, I swear to God, you're bad.

256
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,440
That man is fucking evil.

257
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,680
Lizzie...

258
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,360
I'm only doing this

259
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,760
to bring the bastard down.

260
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,240
Yeah, but why?

261
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,280
Tommy, why?

262
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,880
I'm supplying the British government

263
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,079
with information on his organisation,

264
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:14,520
and in return they are giving me
favourable terms on defence contracts.

265
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:15,920
No.

266
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,280
You're doing it because you think
somebody should stop him.

267
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,160
-I saw your face when he was speaking.

268
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,119
You're doing it because you think
it's the right thing to do.

269
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,680
All this time, you just did things
that feel nice because you can afford it.

270
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,240
Lizzie, please, please, please, stop.

271
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,800
Don't scare me

272
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,120
by saying you see things in my face.

273
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,880
I still want things that feel nice.

274
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,040
-Linda.
-Arthur.

275
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,560
Linda.

276
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,320
Let's go.

277
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,200
Let's go. Let's leave.

278
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,440
Let's get in the car.

279
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,680
We'll go and pick up Billy.

280
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,800
We'll drive to the docks.

281
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,000
Any dock you want.

282
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,640
We'll get on a boat.

283
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,560
We'll sail away.

284
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,200
You and me.

285
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,080
Any destination.

286
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,800
Be careful, it's...

287
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,480
It's broken everywhere.

288
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,320
We leave tonight. Hmm?

289
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,160
We leave this place.

290
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,000
We never come back, Linda.

291
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,200
We never come back.

292
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,360
I mean that.

293
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,840
We go before it gets light.

294
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,600
Say yes.

295
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,480
-I've got a better idea.
-Yeah?

296
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,240
You stay here...

297
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,600
living inside your head,

298
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,840
inside your knife, inside your war.

299
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,200
I'm glad I didn't shoot you.

300
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,720
It would've been a kindness.

301
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,880
Now, get out.

302
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,840
-Oh, please.

303
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,600
An evening with
a bunch of fucking Gypsies.

304
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,000
I will shoot!

305
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,840
Peter! Peter! Kick it here!

306
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,320
Kick it here, mister!

307
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,040
<i>This is a cheque guarantee. </i>

308
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,920
Signed by Mosley

309
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,560
on behalf of a man called Jimmy McCavern.

310
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,640
A cheque for what?

311
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,960
Well, I said it was
for the sale of a gin distillery.

312
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,800
But it doesn't matter.

313
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:27,120
It is direct evidence
of a link between Mosley

314
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,560
and the head
of an organised criminal network.

315
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,560
A relationship he will try to deny

316
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,840
after the bonfire of all conventions.

317
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,880
It also contains the names of MPs
who have signed up to the movement.

318
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,960
And those MPs who are sympathetic

319
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:48,640
but will not show their hand until
the organisation is announced officially.

320
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,200
On the second of January.

321
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,480
In Grosvenor House.

322
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,080
You might want to write some of this down.

323
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:58,480
I am experiencing resistance
from my superior officers, too.

324
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,120
This isn't intelligence, Younger.

325
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,560
This is evidence.

326
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,320
Give it to the Branch.

327
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,800
Special Branch?

328
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,720
Half of whom spend their lives defending
the Union against Fenians,

329
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,000
and the other half who spend their lives

330
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,360
defending men like Mosley
against socialists.

331
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,560
I heard about his speech
at your house the other night.

332
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,840
It was favourably reported as
the passionate and spontaneous outpouring

333
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,640
of a man moved by
the emotions of a ballet.

334
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,520
-Reported where?
<i>-Daily Mail, Morning Post, Daily Mirror.</i>

335
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:36,320
It's upper, middle, and working class,
all united in admiration.

336
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,240
Also, I'm being asked the source
of my information on Mosley.

337
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,920
-Which you don't divulge.
-No.

338
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,320
As a result, my six-monthly review
was unfavourable.

339
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,480
They're talking about moving me to
a black and coloured desk in Johannesburg.

340
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,080
I also suspect there are specific threats
to me personally

341
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,400
from an organisation called "Section D".

342
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,880
I believe you've had a dispute
with them in the past.

343
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,240
Sit down, Younger.

344
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,280
We are now Section D.

345
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,560
I fucking beat them.

346
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,560
You're a soldier, I'm a soldier.

347
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:39,920
There are elements within the state
who are prepared to kill.

348
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,600
We need to meet them unafraid.

349
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,200
Spoken like a true believer.

350
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,360
My superiors also ask why the information
on Jessie Eden and the communists

351
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,200
has apparently dried up.

352
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,440
Why has it dried up, Mr Shelby?

353
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,960
Your sister has an interesting theory.

354
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:06,520
She thinks perhaps at last Tommy Shelby

355
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,880
has actually started
to believe in something.

356
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,680
Younger.

357
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,320
Please don't listen
to my sister's opinions of me.

358
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,280
They are always...

359
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,200
hopeful.

360
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,840
Therefore, they are always wrong.

361
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,840
Can you hear me? Look at me.

362
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,720
You're going to be all right.
I'll be back.

363
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,760
You'll be okay.

364
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,880
Look at me. It's okay. It's all right.

365
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,200
Fuck.

366
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:32,000
Call an ambulance! Call Moss!
Find out where I can reach him.

367
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,000
Come on, love. Up you get.

368
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,080
Good girl. Come on.
Take her. Take her.

369
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,360
Come on. Up you get.
Up you get. Good boy.

370
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,560
Come on. In you go.

371
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,400
Inside. Stay inside.

372
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:39,600
Tommy?

373
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,720
Let's sit down, Ada.

374
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,000
What's happened?

375
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,680
Here.

376
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,120
Sit down, eh?

377
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,040
Ben Younger is dead.

378
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,120
Someone put a bomb in his car.

379
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,400
I don't know how you felt about him
or how bad this is going to hurt,

380
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,880
but whatever happens, just remember
you have a baby inside of you.

381
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,840
God.

382
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,560
Anyone you touch.

383
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,960
Which means anyone I touch.

384
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,680
Which means anyone any of us touch.

385
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,200
He never knew I was pregnant.

386
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,040
I hadn't told him.

387
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,880
God, I didn't love him.

388
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,720
But I liked him.

389
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,680
He was decent and good.

390
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,040
And I wasn't going to marry him.

391
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,560
The baby was a mistake, but that's okay...

392
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,120
because I didn't

393
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:08,720
ask anything of him.

394
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,360
God, he didn't deserve us.

395
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,440
Well, I've spoken to his family.

396
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,320
They're going to take care of the funeral.

397
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,560
It will go down as an IRA assassination
of a British military officer.

398
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,880
And what was it really?

399
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,800
It was...

400
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,240
a consequence of good intentions.

401
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,760
My good intentions.

402
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,400
I pushed him to report on the fascists.
I thought it was the right thing to do.

403
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:56,920
And as a result, Section D or the Branch
or Intelligence had him killed.

404
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,960
There was a kid,

405
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,480
died in the explosion.

406
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,880
He was ten years old.

407
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,040
It's funny...

408
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,440
isn't it? How it works?

409
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,760
No, Tommy.

410
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,800
Don't give yourself this excuse.

411
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,120
He was ten years old.

412
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,320
If I would have stuck to what I do,

413
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,480
he'd still be kicking
a ball in the street.

414
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,720
It's funny, isn't it?

415
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,800
Push the button,

416
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:52,320
unlock the door, and come home to me.

417
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,880
Chinese lanterns! Brass on deck!

418
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,600
God fucking help us.

419
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,120
Chang will be waiting
at the dock with the cargo.

420
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,760
We weigh it, we load it, we fuck off.

421
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,679
Where the fuck is Chang?

422
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,440
Isiah, take point.

423
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,560
Look lively.

424
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,760
Right. There's your lanterns.

425
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,440
Where the fuck are the Chinese?

426
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,520
All right.

427
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,400
Arthur, it's Chang.

428
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,440
Get over. Get over! Get over!

429
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,040
I knew we shouldn't trust these fuckers
and their fucking lanterns.

430
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:04,360
If it's police, hold fire.
Chang, where's the stuff? Where is it?

431
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,240
They didn't look like police.

432
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,400
Smelled of gin.

433
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,560
They said they were taking the opium
on behalf of the king.

434
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,480
Then they saw your boat coming.

435
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,040
So, were they Italian?

436
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,640
-Were they Italian?
-Irish.

437
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,600
-Irish, I think.
-Oh, fuck.

438
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,680
Fuck!

439
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,560
Curly, my gun. Give me the gun.
Give it up! That's it.

440
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,640
Listen. Listen to me!

441
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,200
They're Titanic boys out there, all right?

442
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,960
They're out of Poplar.
In the war, they were very capable.

443
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,880
Very capable soldiers.

444
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,480
So was I.

445
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:39,280
I was a fucking capable soldier, too.

446
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,480
Hey!

447
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:44,000
Hey, you fucking bastards!

448
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,320
Arthur! Arthur! Stop firing!
Arthur, they're gone.

449
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,480
To any of you still alive,

450
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:21,360
you do not fuck
with the Peaky fucking Blinders.

451
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,720
Oh.

452
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,800
Yeah.

453
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,480
Here we go.

454
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,640
Hmm.

455
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,200
Chang.

456
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,400
Purest ever in Europe.

457
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,680
Arthur, there's a dead man
in a copper's uniform.

458
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,560
Should I throw him in the cut?

459
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:16,840
No.

460
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,800
No, he'll float, won't he?

461
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,760
Even Irishmen fucking float.

462
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,440
No. Go and find a...

463
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,360
Go and find a kiln or something.

464
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,480
But there are men working them.

465
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,120
Why do you carry a gun, Isiah, eh?

466
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,520
Or razor blades in your cap?

467
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,840
Because you're a Peaky fucking Blinder,
that's why.

468
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,560
You take that body
and you burn it to the bone.

469
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,560
And if anybody speaks to you on that,

470
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,000
you offer them the chance
to burn in that furnace with him.

471
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,840
All right?

472
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,320
Yes, Arthur.

473
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,280
Yeah.

474
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,840
Yeah.

475
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,560
Do we know the people
who tried to trick us?

476
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,320
The uncles will be mad.

477
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:07,320
Fuck your uncles. And your aunts,
your cousins, all of them. Right?

478
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,720
Curly, load this up onto the boat.

479
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,720
Let's get back to Birmingham, eh?

480
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:16,440
Get back to fucking civilisation.

481
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,360
And find out who's been talking. Yeah.

482
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,480
Now, look. The Titanic heard
about this, right?

483
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:27,240
That means every gang from Poplar
to Birmingham will be here.

484
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,200
Well, let them come.

485
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,080
Let them come, Aberama!

486
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,520
Yeah.

487
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,760
Oh, let them fucking come.

488
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,320
Yeah.

Hat and coat off.

504
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,600
Stand up against the wall.

505
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,480
For your own safety,
I need to search you for items

506
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,400
that could potentially be used
as weapons against you.

507
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,240
Oh, that's nice.

508
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,560
He was my friend.

509
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,400
Yeah, well he's nobody's friend anymore.

510
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,000
He's a fucking animal.

511
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,440
Laces out of your shoes.

512
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,800
Table.

513
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,160
Barney! Visitor.

514
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,320
This one's real.

515
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,960
You can wait here.

516
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,520
No. I can't.

517
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,320
It's your funeral.
I'll have to lock you in.

518
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,240
Yeah.

519
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,080
Hello, Barney.

520
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,960
Arthur says to say "hello".

521
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,160
Sergeant Major?

522
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,240
You're alive?

523
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:07,480
Arthur's alive, John's dead,
Danny's dead, Freddie's dead,

524
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,320
Jeremiah preaches the gospel barefoot.

525
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,560
Yeah.

526
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:15,960
And I'm alive.

527
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,960
Thems who're gone are the lucky ones.

528
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,680
Thanks for the letters
you send, Sergeant Major.

529
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,640
Yeah, Arthur mostly writes them. I just...

530
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,160
just sign them.

531
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:36,960
How the fuck do you write back?
With your fucking teeth?

532
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,800
No, they stick a pen up me arse.

533
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,880
Someone in here said your name.

534
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,280
They said out there
you are a politician now.

535
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:00,720
Sometimes, yeah.

536
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:05,160
Didn't know if it was real, comrade.

537
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,880
I see rats coming out of bodies
like at the black wood.

538
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:12,080
The shit they give me in here...

539
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:21,320
Hey, Barney. Look at me.

540
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,680
Barney, this here is opium and cyanide.

541
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,480
Bring on a heart attack.

542
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,960
They won't even check the cause.
You won't feel a fucking thing.

543
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:45,320
So, here.

544
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,040
You're in here forever, brother.

545
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,600
Don't have the use of your fucking hands.

546
00:44:55,640 --> 00:44:57,080
You're still in the tunnels.

547
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:00,520
I can give this to you now.

548
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,200
You want it?

549
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,680
No.

550
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,640
Why not?

551
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,400
I know.

552
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,320
I know.

553
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,560
You still remember that French waitress.

554
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,560
You still going on about that, Tom?

555
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:56,960
Yeah.

556
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:58,920
Did you fuck her before me?

557
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,560
Because whoever did
gave me the fucking clap,

558
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,800
and I'm guessing it was you.

559
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,400
-Yes, I fucked her before you did.
-Yeah.

560
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,560
She was beautiful.

561
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,320
She was. She was.

562
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,200
And I reckon I was second best
after Barney.

563
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,040
Why did you bring the capsule, Tom?

564
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,680
You're in here, Barney.

565
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,040
You have no hands.

566
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,920
There is no daylight.

567
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:26,440
And you don't want to die.

568
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,040
No, I don't.

569
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:35,720
Because one day things might change.

570
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,280
Yeah.

571
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:50,720
Things might change.

572
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,760
Maybe they already have.

573
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:58,720
Come here, Barney.

574
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:01,520
Come here.

575
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,000
What if I could break you out of here?

576
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,960
Why would you break me out?

577
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:14,720
See, the trouble with the people in here
is the fucking meds they keep you on.

578
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,720
Ten years since we're back.

579
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,880
Barney, ten fucking years.

580
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,160
Maybe the storm has passed.

581
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:26,720
Passed for you then, has it, Tom?

582
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,120
What would the world do with me
if I was out?

583
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,320
I have a job for you.

584
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,160
-Fuck.
-Barney.

585
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:41,840
Barney, you were the best fucking sniper
in our company. Never missed.

586
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,400
I can use that man.

587
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:50,240
Get you the latest BSA,
fucking telescopic sights.

588
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,360
Who am I shooting?

589
00:47:52,440 --> 00:47:55,760
The fuck do you care, Barney?
Get that fucking thing off.

590
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:56,680
Get you free.

591
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:58,200
- You all right in there?

592
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,400
Grand in here.

593
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,640
What do you say, Barney?

594
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:07,800
I'll come for you

595
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,000
after midnight on Wednesday.

596
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,320
I don't keep track of days, Tom.

597
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:13,400
Don't have to.

598
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,720
You'll know it will be Wednesday
because there'll be a big fucking bang.

599
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,040
All right.

600
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:25,240
Big fucking bang.

601
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,360
Big fucking bang.

602
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,760
Big fucking bang.

00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,120
Big bang on Wednesday!

612
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:42,440
They called from the Black Boy in Knowle.

613
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:44,600
They'll be here any minute.

614
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,920
I hear you agreed to give up the north.

615
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:52,720
I hear there needs to be some certainty
in the south.

616
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:56,920
Some of my people were attacked
by members of the Titanic.

617
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,400
They've heard about the cargo.

618
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:03,080
Mr Mosley is open to suggestion
regarding who he can rely on

619
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,840
to offer him support in London.

620
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:10,040
Well, I would suggest the most competent
organiser of men in the south

621
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,480
is Alfie Solomons.

622
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,240
He's dead.

623
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,360
And he's Jewish.

624
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,120
And I'd say as far as our boss
is concerned,

625
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,600
him being dead would be less
of an obstacle than him being Jewish.

626
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,360
I think he'll give London to the Italians.

627
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,760
He likes Italians.

628
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,160
That'll mean more concessions
on your part,

629
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,160
but you're going to have to accept it,
tinker boy.

630
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:40,920
I like Wincanton.

631
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,360
It's a grand old racecourse.

632
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:46,880
That brother of yours,

633
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,880
the one who lent me a hand grenade...

634
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,440
he'd be the first
of you tinkers I'd go for

635
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,840
if our truce should end
and the whistle blew.

636
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:58,480
Good.

637
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:00,920
He's in the mood for a quarrel.

638
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,280
We had a brush with the Titanic, Tom.

639
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:07,200
Yeah, I heard.

640
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,400
Yeah.

641
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,600
Fun night.

642
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,160
Got noisy, though.

643
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:15,880
And to think they all said I was mad
to take me dad with me, eh?

644
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:18,040
Your dad? Who's your dad?

645
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,000
This is my fucking dad.

646
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,240
Right here.

647
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,680
This is my fucking dad.

648
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:25,960
Where's Aberama?

649
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,400
He got off at Solihull.

650
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,320
Said if he sees Billy Boy here,

651
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,320
he'll cut his fucking throat.

652
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:39,840
Tell the tinker he's welcome
to come and try at any time.

653
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:40,760
Hmm.

654
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,440
Is it all aboard?

655
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:48,400
Yeah.

656
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,240
It's all there.

657
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,720
We weighed it at the wharf.

658
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:53,960
We used Cockney scales.

659
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,040
I wouldn't trust them,
they're probably crooked.

660
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,520
But, er...

661
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,440
I reckon seven tons.

662
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:01,560
Curly!

663
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:06,280
Put ten sacks of flour
onto Mr McCavern's boat.

664
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:07,800
Tom...

665
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,960
I don't think it's really flour.

666
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,880
I know, Curly. Just do as I say.

667
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,280
Yeah. Yeah.

668
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:14,800
Curly.

669
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:21,040
Hey, Arthur.

670
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,440
Someday, yes?

671
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:24,920
You and me?

672
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,160
Oh, Tommy, eh?

673
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:31,200
Fascists. Hmm?

674
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,400
Look at them.

675
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,520
I fucking hate them,

676
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:37,280
always have done.

677
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,520
But you?

678
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,560
You, Billy Boy.

679
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,240
Oh, you're special.
You know, I fucking like him, Tommy.

680
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,720
I like you.

681
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,960
I do. You're a man after me own heart.

682
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,800
-Someday, Mr Shelby.
-Yeah.

683
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:53,720
-Someday.
-Yeah.

684
00:52:55,080 --> 00:52:55,920
Yeah.

685
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,880
You just tell me when, Tom.

686
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,360
You just tell me when.

687
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:10,360
So...

688
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,120
-So, you spoke to Barney Thomason, eh?
-Yeah.

689
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:17,720
Barney Thomason...

690
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:23,000
is going to kill Oswald Mosley.

691
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,560
Shoot him in the fucking head.

692
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,120
Yep.

693
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:30,880
While he's onstage.
While I'm stood next to him.

694
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:35,240
And then I will take over
as the leader of the party,

695
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,680
and you and Aberama
can take care of that bastard, McCavern.

696
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:45,280
I had more complicated strategies
in mind for Mr Mosley.

697
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,400
Then he spoke badly to my wife.

698
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:52,600
It's going to be
a busy few weeks, brother.

699
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:53,520
Yeah.
