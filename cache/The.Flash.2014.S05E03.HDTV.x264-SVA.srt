1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,395
Previously on "The Flash"...

2
00:00:01,398 --> 00:00:04,007
We have a kid who defied
the laws of physics

3
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:05,543
to hang out with her parents.

4
00:00:07,688 --> 00:00:09,154
- Melt.
- Killer Frost...

5
00:00:09,156 --> 00:00:09,937
Is gone.

6
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:11,182
The only time you need your mother

7
00:00:11,184 --> 00:00:12,204
is when you're in trouble.

8
00:00:12,206 --> 00:00:14,046
My father's death certificate.

9
00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:15,527
The M.E. who signed off on it,

10
00:00:15,529 --> 00:00:16,516
he doesn't exist.

11
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:18,118
Now I know why she never wants to leave

12
00:00:18,121 --> 00:00:20,437
her dad's side and never
wants to be by mine.

13
00:00:22,369 --> 00:00:23,502
I just lost my speed.

14
00:00:24,705 --> 00:00:26,405
Sounds like an insect.

15
00:00:26,407 --> 00:00:27,706
Like a cicada.

16
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:28,841
Who's Cicada?

17
00:00:42,056 --> 00:00:43,622
As a kid

18
00:00:43,624 --> 00:00:45,497
there was a part of the Flash Museum

19
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,427
that always scared me.

20
00:00:48,429 --> 00:00:50,003
I guess it's normal for children

21
00:00:50,006 --> 00:00:51,703
to be afraid of monsters.

22
00:00:54,435 --> 00:00:57,636
But this monster was different.

23
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,640
No one knows where he came from,

24
00:01:01,642 --> 00:01:03,609
how he got his powers,

25
00:01:03,611 --> 00:01:05,177
who he is.

26
00:01:05,179 --> 00:01:07,713
All that's known is his alias,

27
00:01:07,715 --> 00:01:10,069
and the last sound his victim's hear.

28
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:13,719
But that's not what makes him scary.

29
00:01:13,721 --> 00:01:15,921
What makes him scary is...

30
00:01:15,923 --> 00:01:18,223
you never catch him.

31
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:22,960

32
00:01:22,963 --> 00:01:24,263
We never catch him?

33
00:01:24,265 --> 00:01:25,998
Supergirl, The Legends,

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,433
even The League tried,
but no one was successful.

35
00:01:28,435 --> 00:01:30,302
Probably 'cause he can
dampen everybody's powers

36
00:01:30,304 --> 00:01:32,938
with that magic friggin' dagger.

37
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,940
Not all superpowers
are meta-humans though.

38
00:01:34,942 --> 00:01:36,975
- What about...
- Green Arrow?

39
00:01:36,977 --> 00:01:38,777
Yeah, he tried too once, but...

40
00:01:38,779 --> 00:01:41,680
So we're dealing with a
meta-human Jack the Ripper.

41
00:01:43,182 --> 00:01:45,082
Amazing.

42
00:01:45,085 --> 00:01:47,019
What else do you know about him?

43
00:01:47,021 --> 00:01:48,820
Just that he...

44
00:01:48,822 --> 00:01:50,455
he's early.

45
00:01:50,457 --> 00:01:51,790
What do you mean he's early?

46
00:01:51,792 --> 00:01:54,234
In my history, Cicada's first victim

47
00:01:54,237 --> 00:01:56,495
was a meta-human named Floyd Belkin.

48
00:01:56,497 --> 00:01:58,597
And he never killed Gridlock or Block.

49
00:01:58,599 --> 00:02:00,165
They're completely different victims.

50
00:02:00,167 --> 00:02:01,433
Because the timeline changed.

51
00:02:01,435 --> 00:02:03,568
Yeah, and now they're both dead...

52
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,170
because of me.

53
00:02:05,172 --> 00:02:06,805
Okay, there's no telling

54
00:02:06,807 --> 00:02:08,573
the ripple effect of this change

55
00:02:08,575 --> 00:02:10,349
or what kind of future
Nora's gonna return to.

56
00:02:10,351 --> 00:02:11,817
We gotta catch this guy fast.

57
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,780
You mean catch the guy
that future us can't catch?

58
00:02:14,783 --> 00:02:17,129
Right, I thought beating
The Thinker was hard.

59
00:02:18,485 --> 00:02:20,852
Guys, it's Joe. CCPD
needs help downtown.

60
00:02:20,854 --> 00:02:22,454
- Okay, I got it.
- No, I'll... I'll do it.

61
00:02:22,456 --> 00:02:23,822
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I got it.

62
00:02:23,824 --> 00:02:24,957
You guys stay here and deal with

63
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,458
the meta serial killer.

64
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,164
Okay, guys, look, we got this.

65
00:02:28,167 --> 00:02:30,262
Let's just canvass some crime scenes,

66
00:02:30,264 --> 00:02:32,331
interview some witnesses,
and see if there's any

67
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:35,500
common acquaintances
between Gridlock and Block.

68
00:02:35,502 --> 00:02:37,002
I have a plan.

69
00:02:37,004 --> 00:02:40,072
You... you've got a plan already?

70
00:02:40,074 --> 00:02:42,007
I know how to fix this.

71
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:51,883
Now nobody try nothing funny.

72
00:02:51,885 --> 00:02:55,354
This baby is solar with
a zero carbon footprint.

73
00:02:55,356 --> 00:02:57,289
I spent a week in the sun charging

74
00:02:57,291 --> 00:03:00,092
with U, V, A, B, and C!

75
00:03:00,094 --> 00:03:02,494
So y'all stay put.

76
00:03:02,496 --> 00:03:03,962
Hey. Hey!

77
00:03:03,964 --> 00:03:07,137
I told you, I brought my own bags.

78
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,002
- Sorry.
- Apology accepted.

79
00:03:10,004 --> 00:03:12,337
Don't forget the other kind of greens.

80
00:03:19,179 --> 00:03:20,898
What the hell?

81
00:03:24,918 --> 00:03:26,785
Fear not, good citizens.

82
00:03:26,787 --> 00:03:29,354
Elongated man is here.

83
00:03:33,193 --> 00:03:34,593
Why do I feel like you're focusing

84
00:03:34,595 --> 00:03:36,194
on the wrong thing?

85
00:03:36,196 --> 00:03:38,286
I just saved you...

86
00:03:38,289 --> 00:03:39,664
Okay, if you're gonna...

87
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:40,999
Just don't post... don't post...

88
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:42,367
I saw you post it.

89
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:46,364
So your plan is to contact Herr Wells?

90
00:03:46,367 --> 00:03:48,000
Yes, that's my plan.

91
00:03:48,003 --> 00:03:50,559
I know in the future you
guys never bring in a Wells

92
00:03:50,562 --> 00:03:51,743
to help you catch Cicada.

93
00:03:51,745 --> 00:03:54,379
So if you want a different
result this time...

94
00:03:54,381 --> 00:03:56,882
I try something new.

95
00:03:56,884 --> 00:03:58,617
It's a great idea.

96
00:03:58,619 --> 00:04:01,119
- 'Cept it's not.
- What?

97
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:02,788
It's a terrible idea. If you're looking

98
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,424
for cooperation, trust
me, this is not your guy.

99
00:04:05,426 --> 00:04:08,032
He is just an asshat.

100
00:04:08,035 --> 00:04:09,434
That's way harsh, Cisco.

101
00:04:09,437 --> 00:04:11,497
- I'm sorry, I'm being harsh?
- Yes.

102
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,898
Go ahead, call him.

103
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,033
See if you don't get a
steaming pile of side-eye.

104
00:04:15,035 --> 00:04:16,401
Okay.

105
00:04:18,505 --> 00:04:20,772
Yah?

106
00:04:22,376 --> 00:04:23,575
The Flash.

107
00:04:23,577 --> 00:04:25,110
Wait for it.

108
00:04:25,112 --> 00:04:27,825
- I love The Flash.
- What?

109
00:04:27,828 --> 00:04:31,149
Oh, you Barry Allen,
yah? With the zoom, zoom,

110
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:33,718
and the defy the
physics laws and gravity.

111
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,684
Always with some style and grace, yah.

112
00:04:36,687 --> 00:04:38,290
Thanks, man.

113
00:04:38,292 --> 00:04:41,256
Das Kinder Flash. Child of the Flash.

114
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:43,793
Obviously, you have your
father's moral fiber, yah.

115
00:04:43,796 --> 00:04:47,532
And your mother's smarts,
and classic beauty.

116
00:04:47,534 --> 00:04:49,768
- Oh, my God. Stop.
- Thank you, Herr Wells.

117
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,770
No, don't thank him.

118
00:04:51,772 --> 00:04:53,505
Don't fall for this ruse.

119
00:04:53,507 --> 00:04:55,774
Clearly this guy is putting on an act.

120
00:04:55,776 --> 00:04:57,142
He's a charlatan.

121
00:04:57,144 --> 00:04:59,644
But you hurt me, stab me in the back,

122
00:04:59,646 --> 00:05:01,480
this guy who must be Cisco.

123
00:05:01,482 --> 00:05:03,448
- You know who I am.
- Hey, don't be rude.

124
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,983
All right, look. Hey, I'm sorry.

125
00:05:04,985 --> 00:05:06,485
We need your help catching

126
00:05:06,487 --> 00:05:09,221
a meta-human serial killer.

127
00:05:09,223 --> 00:05:10,889
Yeah, I have heard of this Cicada.

128
00:05:10,891 --> 00:05:13,358
Of course, the message
already from Kinder Flash.

129
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,527
Unfortunately, I'm otherwise occupied,

130
00:05:15,529 --> 00:05:17,192
unable to assist you at this time.

131
00:05:17,195 --> 00:05:18,563
- You can't?
- Nein.

132
00:05:18,565 --> 00:05:20,113
But, I have done one better

133
00:05:20,116 --> 00:05:21,582
and called someone who can.

134
00:05:21,585 --> 00:05:23,835
This man is a legend, this man is

135
00:05:23,837 --> 00:05:27,072
the greatest detective
in all the Multiverse.

136
00:05:27,074 --> 00:05:28,960
So I've attached his coordinates

137
00:05:28,963 --> 00:05:30,475
- if you want to look at them.
- Okay.

138
00:05:30,477 --> 00:05:32,677
- Yah, do you see it?
- Got 'em.

139
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:34,500
- Good.
- Cisco.

140
00:05:34,503 --> 00:05:36,248
Cisco what? You want
me to breach him here?

141
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:38,543
- Yeah.
- Hello? I just got Benihana'd.

142
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,734
- Hurts a little bit.
- Sorry.

143
00:05:39,737 --> 00:05:41,820
Why don't we just breach him
here the old fashioned way?

144
00:05:41,822 --> 00:05:44,356
Hey, man, thank you
for this. This is great.

145
00:05:44,358 --> 00:05:46,858
Privilege and an honor
to help The Flash, yah,

146
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,794
and Kinder Flash, and Iris Flash, yah.

147
00:05:49,796 --> 00:05:51,129
Bye, Kinder Flash.

148
00:05:51,131 --> 00:05:52,703
Bye, Herr Wells.

149
00:05:52,706 --> 00:05:54,266
Nice guy.

150
00:05:54,268 --> 00:05:55,336
What are you talking about, man?

151
00:05:55,338 --> 00:05:57,269
- He's awesome.
- He's not...

152
00:05:57,271 --> 00:05:58,937
You know what?

153
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:00,539
Let's just turn on the extrapolator

154
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:02,407
and get this master detective out here.

155
00:06:15,622 --> 00:06:18,423
Well...

156
00:06:18,425 --> 00:06:20,959
I imagine your Earth would be colder.

157
00:06:23,263 --> 00:06:25,754
Harrison Sherloque Wells

158
00:06:25,757 --> 00:06:27,265
at your service.

159
00:06:28,914 --> 00:06:32,037
I'm here to catch your killer.

160
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:05,204
Barry, what is he doing?

161
00:07:05,207 --> 00:07:06,916
I don't know. Maybe it's some kind

162
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:08,508
- of CSI kit?
- Voila.

163
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:11,388
Shh. Just let him...

164
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,391
Mmm. That's the stuff.

165
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:15,792
And now we can begin.

166
00:07:15,794 --> 00:07:17,260
- Tea?
- That's right.

167
00:07:17,262 --> 00:07:18,962
We've been watching you for 20 minutes.

168
00:07:18,964 --> 00:07:20,663
You're welcome.

169
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:23,266
- Cannot rush excellence.
- This is a waste of time.

170
00:07:23,268 --> 00:07:26,002
Thank you very much
for coming, Cumberbatch.

171
00:07:26,004 --> 00:07:29,438
I'm sure you would like it
if I took my leave, right?

172
00:07:29,441 --> 00:07:32,409
Could have more time to recover
from your recent heartbreak.

173
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:34,044
What are you talking about?

174
00:07:34,046 --> 00:07:35,969
Subcutaneous under-eye bruising,

175
00:07:35,972 --> 00:07:38,281
which indicates you've been crying.

176
00:07:38,283 --> 00:07:40,483
Flaky skin, which indicates dehydration,

177
00:07:40,485 --> 00:07:42,819
probably from alcohol consumption.

178
00:07:42,821 --> 00:07:45,855
Alcohol plus crying
can only mean one thing.

179
00:07:45,857 --> 00:07:47,724
You have been dumped.

180
00:07:47,726 --> 00:07:48,821
Wrong, detective.

181
00:07:48,824 --> 00:07:51,126
- I have not been dumped.
- Oh, no?

182
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:54,097
It was a mutual decision, okay?

183
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:56,566
Cynthia and I, we reached a
decision together as a team.

184
00:07:56,568 --> 00:07:57,657
Sure. Of course.

185
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,298
Okay, and I haven't been sobbing.

186
00:07:59,301 --> 00:08:02,971
In fact, I can't remember the
last time I cried about it.

187
00:08:02,974 --> 00:08:04,841
Excuse me.

188
00:08:07,045 --> 00:08:09,049
You are the resident
speedster, I presume?

189
00:08:09,052 --> 00:08:10,726
- How did you...
- Who favors stopping

190
00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:12,148
on his right heel?

191
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,851
Can tell from the wear
and tear on your footwear.

192
00:08:14,853 --> 00:08:18,021
It's uneven. A trait
that you have inherited

193
00:08:18,023 --> 00:08:19,856
from your father. Although you do share

194
00:08:19,858 --> 00:08:21,458
a little bit more body
language with your mother,

195
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,059
who's been touching her left shoulder

196
00:08:23,061 --> 00:08:25,261
since I came around here.
What are you hiding from me?

197
00:08:25,263 --> 00:08:26,529
Excuse me?

198
00:08:26,531 --> 00:08:28,131
I am not hiding anything.

199
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:30,333
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
Yes, you are, but what?

200
00:08:30,336 --> 00:08:33,410
You have touched it, like...

201
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:35,205
it's something there, then gone again,

202
00:08:35,207 --> 00:08:37,340
something removed. A tattoo, right?

203
00:08:37,342 --> 00:08:39,690
Yes, perhaps from a former lover?

204
00:08:39,693 --> 00:08:41,159
Okay! You know what?

205
00:08:41,162 --> 00:08:44,880
I think that this
Sherloque has proven himself

206
00:08:44,883 --> 00:08:48,017
and that we should start finding Cicada.

207
00:08:48,019 --> 00:08:50,553
Excellent. Let's find Cicada.

208
00:08:50,555 --> 00:08:53,156
But first, the question of my fee.

209
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:54,424
You're charging us?

210
00:08:54,426 --> 00:08:56,960
This service is not free, right?

211
00:08:56,962 --> 00:08:58,728
I don't work for charity.

212
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:00,330
Can already tell the young doctor here

213
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:02,732
is expecting to hire
me for another case.

214
00:09:02,734 --> 00:09:04,134
I saw you glance at your purse,

215
00:09:04,136 --> 00:09:05,719
and I'm happy to assist
you in that mystery.

216
00:09:05,721 --> 00:09:07,695
But first, I think we can all agree

217
00:09:07,698 --> 00:09:11,708
that a villain of Cicada's caliber...

218
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:14,644
will require a substantial fee.

219
00:09:14,646 --> 00:09:16,379
Yeah.

220
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:19,424
Shrap, that's a lot of
money even from when I from.

221
00:09:19,427 --> 00:09:21,417
I'm very expensive, but very worth it.

222
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:23,119
What do you think?

223
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:27,090
I mean, we could sell off
some of Star Labs stock.

224
00:09:27,092 --> 00:09:30,627
- Yes! We have an agreement.
- Yeah.

225
00:09:30,629 --> 00:09:32,462
Do you hear that?

226
00:09:32,464 --> 00:09:34,864
Sounds of these frantic
steps, we're being approached

227
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:38,168
either by a tall, sensitive man, or...

228
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,936
a frightened, baby giraffe.

229
00:09:39,938 --> 00:09:43,306
I got... I got a problem
here, guys, and I...

230
00:09:43,308 --> 00:09:44,774
- Hey.
- Hello, baby giraffe.

231
00:09:44,776 --> 00:09:46,643
Harry, how are you?

232
00:09:46,645 --> 00:09:48,978
This is Sherloque Wells.

233
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:53,101
Loque. Sherloque. "L-O-Q-U-E."

234
00:09:53,104 --> 00:09:55,318
Sherloque. I'm French.

235
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,819
- "Sher-lowk" here is...
- Loque.

236
00:09:56,821 --> 00:09:59,522
...is gonna help us find Cicada.

237
00:09:59,524 --> 00:10:02,125
Oh, cool, so you're like a detective.

238
00:10:02,127 --> 00:10:04,527
Oh, detective, the fans.

239
00:10:04,529 --> 00:10:06,696
Who should I make the autograph out to?

240
00:10:06,698 --> 00:10:08,431
Little baby giraffe.

241
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:10,466
Uh, no, no, no. I'm... I'm... listen.

242
00:10:10,468 --> 00:10:11,868
I'm a detective as well.

243
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:14,204
Yeah. Yeah.

244
00:10:14,206 --> 00:10:18,374
Ah, well...

245
00:10:18,376 --> 00:10:19,976
That's right, well, you're a detective.

246
00:10:19,978 --> 00:10:21,911
What... what have you solved recently?

247
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:24,214
Most recently? I uncovered the case

248
00:10:24,216 --> 00:10:25,982
of the stolen Chevy.

249
00:10:27,352 --> 00:10:30,253
Of Impala.

250
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:31,917
- Funny.
- Hmm.

251
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,557
Very funny from the looks of things.

252
00:10:34,559 --> 00:10:36,926
Well, okay, so I saved
all these hostages

253
00:10:36,928 --> 00:10:39,262
and... and all anybody can
talk about is this picture,

254
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:42,034
and turned into a meme.
And... and... it's...

255
00:10:42,037 --> 00:10:44,601
This is... I just... I don't
think anybody in this city

256
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:46,336
takes me seriously.

257
00:10:46,338 --> 00:10:48,671
Oh, there's 14 million
people in this city.

258
00:10:48,673 --> 00:10:52,775
Only 500,000 have reposted this.

259
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,677
Yeah.

260
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:57,680
So, uh... Cicada?

261
00:10:57,682 --> 00:10:58,848
Cicada, yes.

262
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,350
I've reviewed your evidence

263
00:11:00,352 --> 00:11:02,118
and I know where to find your killer.

264
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,587
So, shall we, let's get this
done before dinner, right?

265
00:11:04,589 --> 00:11:06,022
All right, allons-y.

266
00:11:06,024 --> 00:11:08,391
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

267
00:11:08,393 --> 00:11:09,926
Not so fast, baby giraffe.

268
00:11:09,928 --> 00:11:12,895
Two detectives only complicates matters.

269
00:11:12,897 --> 00:11:15,565
Especially when only one is a master.

270
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:17,600
So why don't you stay put?

271
00:11:17,602 --> 00:11:20,937
You can, bite the leaves.
Everyone else, come with em.

272
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:27,237
- You okay?
- Hmm?

273
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,911
Oh, yeah. I'm...

274
00:11:28,913 --> 00:11:30,780
Yeah, I'm... I'm great.
I just got shut down

275
00:11:30,782 --> 00:11:33,116
by Jean-Claude Van Damme.

276
00:11:33,118 --> 00:11:34,884
You know Cicada's not the only mystery

277
00:11:34,886 --> 00:11:36,386
around here that needs solving.

278
00:11:37,956 --> 00:11:39,555
Yeah.

279
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:42,892
Mom, I know it sounds crazy,

280
00:11:42,894 --> 00:11:47,130
but we think someone forged
Dad's death certificate.

281
00:11:47,132 --> 00:11:49,265
Have you any proof?

282
00:11:49,267 --> 00:11:53,269
No, well, yes, sort of.

283
00:11:53,271 --> 00:11:55,238
It's complicated, but

284
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,507
I just thought you should know.

285
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:02,478
- Unless I already knew.
- I didn't say that.

286
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,013
It's why you're here, isn't it?

287
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:05,615
If this is some elaborate,

288
00:12:05,617 --> 00:12:07,183
possibly nefarious cover-up,

289
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:08,679
it must be mom's doing.

290
00:12:08,682 --> 00:12:09,687
It's not like she's ever

291
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:11,254
had your best interests at heart.

292
00:12:11,256 --> 00:12:13,289
You always do this.

293
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:14,590
I just want to know the truth.

294
00:12:14,592 --> 00:12:16,926
I think I deserve to know that.

295
00:12:16,928 --> 00:12:18,628
Is...

296
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,829
my dad even really...

297
00:12:19,831 --> 00:12:21,631
Caitlin, your father is dead.

298
00:12:21,633 --> 00:12:23,499
And if you care about
my feelings at all,

299
00:12:23,501 --> 00:12:26,402
you'll just let this be.

300
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,040
Thanks, mom. Pleasure as always.

301
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:34,277
Don't become obsessed with the past.

302
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:37,714
Your father had that flaw.
It nearly led to his ruin

303
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:39,615
even before his death.

304
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,519
I trust you know the way out.

305
00:12:47,692 --> 00:12:49,526
I'm sorry we came

306
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:51,260
all this way for no reason.

307
00:12:51,262 --> 00:12:54,630
No, I'm impressed. Your
mom is a really good liar.

308
00:12:54,632 --> 00:12:56,966
Yeah, I know she forged
this death certificate.

309
00:12:56,968 --> 00:12:59,869
I just... She's never gonna tell us why.

310
00:12:59,871 --> 00:13:01,537
We've hit a brick wall.

311
00:13:01,539 --> 00:13:03,206
Ah, but where you see a wall

312
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:06,876
this detective sees a
brick door with no handle.

313
00:13:06,878 --> 00:13:10,513
What I mean is I know exactly
how to get what we came for.

314
00:13:18,556 --> 00:13:20,423
- You sure he's in there?
- I'm certain.

315
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,745
Now, your evidence, while slight,

316
00:13:22,748 --> 00:13:25,094
was enough to build
a psychologic profile.

317
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,397
This is a man hiding in the shadows.

318
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:29,417
This is someone who's been pushed

319
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,534
to the peripheries of society,

320
00:13:31,536 --> 00:13:33,378
and then now he sits alone

321
00:13:33,381 --> 00:13:35,872
waiting for the moment to strike.

322
00:13:35,874 --> 00:13:38,750
All this, plus the census data

323
00:13:38,753 --> 00:13:41,511
cross-referenced with the
location of his attacks,

324
00:13:41,513 --> 00:13:45,415
and the profile narrows to one name...

325
00:13:45,417 --> 00:13:47,483
David Hersch.

326
00:13:48,386 --> 00:13:50,109
Nora's plan might actually work.

327
00:13:50,112 --> 00:13:51,845
Well, it will work.

328
00:13:55,994 --> 00:13:58,928
Once inside, you should
find a small booby trap.

329
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,396
I found it.

330
00:14:01,366 --> 00:14:02,784
I'm on it.

331
00:14:05,236 --> 00:14:06,936
Here is the critical part.

332
00:14:06,938 --> 00:14:08,571
It's a decoy.

333
00:14:24,378 --> 00:14:26,789
Sorry. I got caught off-guard.

334
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:35,729
Not so tough without your dagger, huh?

335
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,773
We got him.

336
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:10,684
That's ridiculous!

337
00:15:10,686 --> 00:15:13,286
I don't know what you're talking about.

338
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:15,021
You don't got anything on me!

339
00:15:15,023 --> 00:15:17,090
- Well, he sounds angry.
- Yeah.

340
00:15:17,092 --> 00:15:18,892
Forensics examined Hersch's hideout

341
00:15:18,894 --> 00:15:20,327
and they found evidence linking him

342
00:15:20,329 --> 00:15:21,995
to several anti-government bombings.

343
00:15:21,997 --> 00:15:23,864
He's been doing it for a while.

344
00:15:23,866 --> 00:15:25,832
- So we got him.
- I don't know.

345
00:15:25,834 --> 00:15:27,901
They didn't find any sign of his dagger

346
00:15:27,903 --> 00:15:28,969
or his mask.

347
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:31,404
Dad, one CSI to another

348
00:15:31,406 --> 00:15:33,507
look at the facts, okay?

349
00:15:33,509 --> 00:15:36,676
Sherloque is the best
detective in the Multiverse.

350
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:38,413
His profile led us to David Hersch,

351
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:39,828
and we found evidence that David Hersch

352
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:40,981
is a mass murderer.

353
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:43,316
What are the chances
that this isn't our guy?

354
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:45,805
- I mean, maybe.
- Come on, we should celebrate.

355
00:15:45,808 --> 00:15:47,266
Okay, I'm gonna gather everyone up,

356
00:15:47,269 --> 00:15:48,271
make some drinks,

357
00:15:48,274 --> 00:15:49,774
and we can have our first party

358
00:15:49,777 --> 00:15:51,057
- in the new lounge.
- I don't know, Nora.

359
00:15:51,059 --> 00:15:52,459
I...

360
00:15:55,731 --> 00:15:58,868
Detective Joseph West.

361
00:15:58,871 --> 00:15:59,900
What do you want?

362
00:15:59,902 --> 00:16:03,537
To finish what I started.

363
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:05,939
The meta-human called Vibe.

364
00:16:05,941 --> 00:16:08,942
Call him here now.

365
00:16:08,944 --> 00:16:10,744
I can't. I don't even know him.

366
00:16:15,884 --> 00:16:17,851
You were saying?

367
00:16:18,787 --> 00:16:22,722
Yes, I mean, he helps CCPD,

368
00:16:22,724 --> 00:16:25,792
but it's not like I have a Vibe phone

369
00:16:25,794 --> 00:16:27,761
so I can just call him up.

370
00:16:27,763 --> 00:16:29,829
He's just a masked do-gooder

371
00:16:29,831 --> 00:16:31,598
that shows up at crime scenes.

372
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:36,836
This could be a crime scene.

373
00:16:43,512 --> 00:16:45,478
When you said you had a plan, Ralph,

374
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,080
I didn't mean you meant
breaking and entering

375
00:16:47,082 --> 00:16:49,849
into my mother's company's files.

376
00:16:53,155 --> 00:16:54,754
Reinforced steel.

377
00:16:54,756 --> 00:16:57,290
It's times like this I
really miss Killer Frost.

378
00:16:57,292 --> 00:16:58,959
Oh, don't you worry.

379
00:16:58,961 --> 00:17:00,160
Ralphie's got it.

380
00:17:03,932 --> 00:17:06,466
Okay.

381
00:17:06,468 --> 00:17:08,535
Yep. Almost there.

382
00:17:08,537 --> 00:17:10,870
Hang on. Yeah, almost got it.

383
00:17:10,872 --> 00:17:12,639
Oh, my God.

384
00:17:12,641 --> 00:17:14,341
- What is it?
- Lasers.

385
00:17:14,343 --> 00:17:16,409
Rooms filled with lasers!

386
00:17:16,411 --> 00:17:18,532
Holy snakies. Oh, my God.

387
00:17:18,535 --> 00:17:19,901
It's like a Rubik's Cube of pain.

388
00:17:19,904 --> 00:17:21,114
I don't know the code.

389
00:17:21,116 --> 00:17:22,616
Try something

390
00:17:22,618 --> 00:17:23,984
that your mother would...

391
00:17:23,986 --> 00:17:26,135
Caitlin! There's gotta be something.

392
00:17:26,138 --> 00:17:27,287
Got it.

393
00:17:29,191 --> 00:17:30,757
You okay?

394
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:33,226
Nothing a gallon of Aloe won't fix.

395
00:17:33,228 --> 00:17:34,394
Ooh.

396
00:17:35,631 --> 00:17:38,498
Look for the name Thomas Snow.

397
00:17:41,136 --> 00:17:42,669
Jackpot.

398
00:17:49,678 --> 00:17:51,011
What is that?

399
00:17:51,013 --> 00:17:53,780
It's a game my dad and I used to play.

400
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:56,883
He would teach me the
periodic table, but...

401
00:17:56,885 --> 00:17:58,217
he would let me make up

402
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,553
my own fictional compounds and elements.

403
00:18:00,555 --> 00:18:02,222
Nerd-onium?

404
00:18:02,224 --> 00:18:04,024
He used to say it's
what made us so smart.

405
00:18:07,262 --> 00:18:09,696
We used to have so much fun together.

406
00:18:09,698 --> 00:18:12,365
Catching bugs in the backyard,

407
00:18:12,367 --> 00:18:16,403
looking at constellations
through a telescope we built.

408
00:18:16,405 --> 00:18:19,039
He taught me so much
about science and life.

409
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:23,009
Maybe he still has
something left to teach you.

410
00:18:29,251 --> 00:18:32,686
What is it? It's a letter from my dad.

411
00:18:32,688 --> 00:18:34,187
Saying...

412
00:18:34,189 --> 00:18:35,622
goodbye.

413
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:40,160
It's a suicide note.

414
00:18:45,267 --> 00:18:47,767
Alcohol, thank you, very much. Merci.

415
00:18:49,271 --> 00:18:50,770
- There he is.
- Hey.

416
00:18:50,772 --> 00:18:52,439
Dad, we're all set to celebrate...

417
00:18:52,441 --> 00:18:53,540
No, hey, um.

418
00:18:53,542 --> 00:18:56,385
Actually, Hersch isn't Cicada.

419
00:18:56,388 --> 00:18:58,178
What?

420
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,512
He has to be.

421
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:02,048
No, I checked Cicada's boot print from

422
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:04,084
both the Block and Gridlock crime scenes

423
00:19:04,086 --> 00:19:06,057
and it's three sizes
larger than Hersch's.

424
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:06,953
It's not him.

425
00:19:06,955 --> 00:19:08,655
Well, of course it's him.

426
00:19:08,657 --> 00:19:10,457
It's always Hersch.

427
00:19:10,459 --> 00:19:13,059
Every time I capture Cicada
it's always the same man.

428
00:19:13,061 --> 00:19:15,100
Wait a minute, you've
caught this guy before?

429
00:19:15,103 --> 00:19:17,737
37 times. I've captured 37 Cicadas,

430
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,998
37 different Earths,

431
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,800
and every time I try to capture him

432
00:19:20,802 --> 00:19:23,603
trail always leads back to
that Earth's David Hersch.

433
00:19:23,605 --> 00:19:27,540
So this psychological
profile that you created,

434
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:30,410
you just made it up?

435
00:19:30,412 --> 00:19:32,078
Not, the first time.

436
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,415
Now the next 36, then I
just trot it out there.

437
00:19:35,417 --> 00:19:36,683
You know, to impress the client,

438
00:19:36,685 --> 00:19:38,485
and then... skip to the end.

439
00:19:38,487 --> 00:19:40,610
And here I thought you
just a bad detective,

440
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:42,246
but you're not a bad detective.

441
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:43,948
You're just a lazy one.

442
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:46,593
I'm not lazy.

443
00:19:46,595 --> 00:19:47,994
I'm efficient, right?

444
00:19:47,996 --> 00:19:49,796
- Anyway, that's not the point!
- Ow!

445
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:52,565
The point's simply
that there's no reason

446
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:54,968
for the Cicada of this
Earth to be anyone other

447
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,903
than David Hersch.

448
00:19:56,905 --> 00:20:00,173
Well, there may be one reason.

449
00:20:00,175 --> 00:20:01,508
What's that?

450
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,009
The timeline.

451
00:20:03,011 --> 00:20:05,011
Yes, since Nora got here

452
00:20:05,013 --> 00:20:07,480
things have changed a bit.

453
00:20:07,482 --> 00:20:08,815
Yeah.

454
00:20:08,817 --> 00:20:10,850
Oh, mais no, you must...

455
00:20:10,852 --> 00:20:12,619
How can you not tell me this?

456
00:20:12,621 --> 00:20:14,154
How am I expected to operate

457
00:20:14,156 --> 00:20:15,855
when you don't give
me all the variables?

458
00:20:15,857 --> 00:20:17,590
I don't know, but what we can expect

459
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:19,651
is a refund, so...

460
00:20:19,654 --> 00:20:21,127
Yeah.

461
00:20:21,129 --> 00:20:23,849
Oh, no, no, no. That money is long gone.

462
00:20:23,852 --> 00:20:25,244
What do you mean "it's gone"?

463
00:20:25,247 --> 00:20:27,400
You spent all that money in one day?

464
00:20:27,402 --> 00:20:28,802
- Right.
- On what.

465
00:20:28,804 --> 00:20:30,479
My ex-wife-ves..

466
00:20:30,482 --> 00:20:33,006
Ex-wives. Seven marriages.

467
00:20:33,008 --> 00:20:34,741
Five wives. Lots of alimony.

468
00:20:34,743 --> 00:20:36,609
That's not the point!
The point is simply

469
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:38,678
this is not my fault.

470
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,280
It's your fault. She is to blame.

471
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:42,415
Timeline variance.

472
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:46,146
Dad.

473
00:20:46,149 --> 00:20:47,954
You're not gonna let Hersch off the hook

474
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:49,556
because of a boot print.

475
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:51,391
He's a meta.

476
00:20:51,393 --> 00:20:53,393
How do we know what this guy can do?

477
00:20:53,395 --> 00:20:55,061
That's the other thing.

478
00:20:55,063 --> 00:20:56,659
Hersch has no dark matter readings.

479
00:20:56,662 --> 00:20:57,864
He's not a meta.

480
00:20:57,866 --> 00:20:59,885
All right, remember.
From one CSI to another,

481
00:20:59,888 --> 00:21:02,368
we have to look at the facts, right?

482
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,970
We got the wrong guy.

483
00:21:03,972 --> 00:21:06,239
No, not this time. You
know what we should do?

484
00:21:06,241 --> 00:21:07,974
We should throw him in the
pipeline for safe keeping

485
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:10,310
until he talks. I'm gonna go get him.

486
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:12,011
Hey, what are you... No, you're not.

487
00:21:12,013 --> 00:21:14,914
We're not gonna kidnap a
suspect in police custody.

488
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,583
If you don't see what's wrong with that,

489
00:21:16,585 --> 00:21:18,084
you can sit this one out.

490
00:21:20,021 --> 00:21:22,989
Well, guess we're back to square one

491
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:25,058
with Cicada.

492
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,659
Yeah.

493
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:29,596
Let's hope it's not too
late to save his next victim.

494
00:21:39,441 --> 00:21:43,276
You have a lovely
family, Detective West.

495
00:21:43,278 --> 00:21:45,712
By not giving me what I want,

496
00:21:45,714 --> 00:21:48,081
by putting your life in danger,

497
00:21:48,083 --> 00:21:51,618
you're gambling their future with you.

498
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,420
If you knew what I know,

499
00:21:54,422 --> 00:21:56,356
you'd cherish them more.

500
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:58,558
I'm not luring Vibe into a death trap.

501
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,627
You can threaten me all you want.

502
00:22:00,629 --> 00:22:02,128
I'm not afraid.

503
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:05,164
I believe you.

504
00:22:05,166 --> 00:22:07,867
But you should be.

505
00:22:25,847 --> 00:22:28,147
Still swirling around up there?

506
00:22:29,763 --> 00:22:32,197
I just don't get Nora.

507
00:22:32,199 --> 00:22:34,332
I mean, I thought our
training was sinking in.

508
00:22:34,334 --> 00:22:36,684
She defeated Block. She
was really making process.

509
00:22:36,687 --> 00:22:39,237
And next thing I know, she
wants to break into CCPD

510
00:22:39,239 --> 00:22:41,973
and kidnap a suspect in police custody.

511
00:22:41,975 --> 00:22:44,075
I mean, it's like she wants to

512
00:22:44,077 --> 00:22:47,312
make Hersch Cicada.

513
00:22:47,314 --> 00:22:50,482
Barry, you really don't
get why she's obsessed?

514
00:22:52,586 --> 00:22:54,586
- Wait. Should I?
- Think about it.

515
00:22:54,588 --> 00:22:56,454
She's been hearing
about the ripple effects

516
00:22:56,456 --> 00:22:58,456
on the timeline since she got here

517
00:22:58,458 --> 00:23:01,092
and at first they were relatively small,

518
00:23:01,094 --> 00:23:02,594
but now...

519
00:23:02,596 --> 00:23:04,892
- Cicada and...
- It's not so small.

520
00:23:04,895 --> 00:23:07,098
He's one of the worst
serial killers in history,

521
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,801
and now because of Nora...

522
00:23:09,803 --> 00:23:11,903
he's here early.

523
00:23:11,905 --> 00:23:13,805
And an entirely different person.

524
00:23:13,807 --> 00:23:15,707
With an entirely
different set of victims.

525
00:23:15,709 --> 00:23:17,809
That is a huge weight
to bear for someone

526
00:23:17,811 --> 00:23:20,278
who just wanted to spend time
with a dad she never knew.

527
00:23:21,442 --> 00:23:23,815
She feels really guilty, Barry.

528
00:23:23,817 --> 00:23:26,751
She wants to try to fix her mistakes

529
00:23:26,753 --> 00:23:29,420
whatever that takes.

530
00:23:29,422 --> 00:23:32,056
Sounds like another
speedster I know actually.

531
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:40,231
Nora says there's an emergency
in the pipeline intake.

532
00:23:42,736 --> 00:23:44,435
Are you sure that...

533
00:23:44,437 --> 00:23:46,004
Sherloque.

534
00:23:46,006 --> 00:23:48,106
- Yeah.
- What happened?

535
00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:51,309
As far as I can tell it looks like

536
00:23:51,311 --> 00:23:52,610
he was in the wrong place

537
00:23:52,612 --> 00:23:54,479
when this fusion cell went critical.

538
00:23:54,481 --> 00:23:57,415
I think it wasn't placed
in its cradle properly.

539
00:23:57,418 --> 00:24:01,052
- Vaporized into ash.
- What a way to go.

540
00:24:01,054 --> 00:24:02,787
- Shenanigans.
- Good grife!

541
00:24:02,789 --> 00:24:04,756
I call shenanigans.

542
00:24:04,758 --> 00:24:07,125
You see, these cells right here,

543
00:24:07,127 --> 00:24:09,661
they run in a redundant cascade circuit.

544
00:24:09,663 --> 00:24:11,129
That's how they power the pipeline,

545
00:24:11,131 --> 00:24:13,798
in the first place,
so if one of them blew

546
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,600
they all would have blown.

547
00:24:15,602 --> 00:24:17,802
Yeah, the whole pipeline
would have exploded.

548
00:24:17,804 --> 00:24:20,505
Exactly right.

549
00:24:20,507 --> 00:24:22,173
- Ugh.
- Mm.

550
00:24:22,175 --> 00:24:25,777
Darjeeling, oolong.

551
00:24:25,779 --> 00:24:27,512
Tea leaves.

552
00:24:27,514 --> 00:24:30,148
Barry, be a dear and check the building

553
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:32,116
for a weasel in a pork pie hat,

554
00:24:32,118 --> 00:24:34,953
about yay tall, smells
vaguely of poutine.

555
00:24:40,227 --> 00:24:43,494
Whoa. Tell me...

556
00:24:43,496 --> 00:24:45,621
who died?

557
00:24:45,624 --> 00:24:47,698
Found him with this.

558
00:24:47,701 --> 00:24:49,068
Of course, you did.

559
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:50,471
So you thought you could just leave

560
00:24:50,473 --> 00:24:52,237
to another Earth without paying us back?

561
00:24:52,239 --> 00:24:54,839
Worked on my fourth wife...

562
00:24:54,841 --> 00:24:57,008
and my sixth.

563
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,776
- Same woman.
- Oh.

564
00:24:58,778 --> 00:24:59,911
Okay, Cisco,

565
00:24:59,913 --> 00:25:01,779
maybe it's time to have a talk

566
00:25:01,781 --> 00:25:03,781
about a little place
called debtor's prison.

567
00:25:03,783 --> 00:25:05,483
Come with me.

568
00:25:05,485 --> 00:25:07,819
- All right.
- You make me miss Herr Wells.

569
00:25:07,821 --> 00:25:08,920
Come with me.

570
00:25:08,922 --> 00:25:11,155
I'm... I'm taking you!

571
00:25:11,157 --> 00:25:12,924
You okay?

572
00:25:12,926 --> 00:25:15,059
Yeah, yeah. It's just...

573
00:25:15,061 --> 00:25:17,666
for second I thought me
inviting Sherloque here

574
00:25:17,669 --> 00:25:20,698
got him killed, and I just, um...

575
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,286
least that's one thing
that's not my fault.

576
00:25:25,672 --> 00:25:28,539
Hey, I wanted to talk to you actually.

577
00:25:28,541 --> 00:25:32,744
I think I understand how you're feeling.

578
00:25:34,214 --> 00:25:36,414
Sometimes our powers
are so extraordinary

579
00:25:36,416 --> 00:25:39,917
it makes our mistakes feel amplified,

580
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,169
especially guilt.

581
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:43,238
Yeah, but I should feel guilty.

582
00:25:44,724 --> 00:25:46,624
I've never messed up this badly before,

583
00:25:46,626 --> 00:25:48,526
and I can't stop thinking about it.

584
00:25:48,528 --> 00:25:50,428
That's just cause you care.

585
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,297
It's okay. It's a good thing.

586
00:25:52,299 --> 00:25:53,965
But...

587
00:25:58,305 --> 00:26:01,205
Nora, if every time you make a mistake

588
00:26:01,207 --> 00:26:02,774
you just rush in to fix it

589
00:26:02,776 --> 00:26:05,076
you're only gonna make things worse.

590
00:26:05,078 --> 00:26:07,679
Trust me, I know that
better than anyone.

591
00:26:09,416 --> 00:26:12,050
You just gotta have a
little more patience.

592
00:26:12,052 --> 00:26:14,185
Take a moment.

593
00:26:14,187 --> 00:26:16,587
Think before you act.

594
00:26:16,589 --> 00:26:19,157
Fix the problem the
right way, all right?

595
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,293
Okay.

596
00:26:24,931 --> 00:26:28,099
Listen, Caitlin, I'm sorry.

597
00:26:28,101 --> 00:26:29,400
For what?

598
00:26:29,402 --> 00:26:32,403
For all of this.

599
00:26:32,405 --> 00:26:34,450
Just I-I felt like a complete joke

600
00:26:34,453 --> 00:26:37,674
after that hostage thing,
and then... Sherloque shows up

601
00:26:37,677 --> 00:26:39,143
and everybody swoons

602
00:26:39,145 --> 00:26:42,113
over his so-called
"Master Detective-ness."

603
00:26:42,115 --> 00:26:43,810
You were nice enough to invite me along,

604
00:26:43,813 --> 00:26:46,825
and I pushed you...

605
00:26:46,828 --> 00:26:50,021
into that, and...

606
00:26:50,023 --> 00:26:51,489
I'm really sorry.

607
00:26:51,491 --> 00:26:53,324
Ralph, this thing you pushed me into

608
00:26:53,326 --> 00:26:55,626
gave me something I've never had before.

609
00:26:55,628 --> 00:26:56,928
Your first felony?

610
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:59,163
No. Closure.

611
00:27:00,233 --> 00:27:04,836
It may not be pretty, but
I finally know the truth.

612
00:27:04,838 --> 00:27:07,472
And that means everything.

613
00:27:07,474 --> 00:27:09,273
So, for my book,

614
00:27:09,275 --> 00:27:11,943
you're the best detective
a girl could ask for.

615
00:27:17,283 --> 00:27:18,916
Hey, you never told me what the code was

616
00:27:18,918 --> 00:27:21,419
on your mom's Resident
Evil laser grid of death.

617
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,764
It was my birthday.

618
00:27:43,543 --> 00:27:47,211
All this and not even a scream.

619
00:27:47,213 --> 00:27:49,887
You've experienced pain before,

620
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:52,481
but not more than me.

621
00:27:56,723 --> 00:27:58,426
No, Cecile don't.

622
00:27:58,429 --> 00:28:00,496
No. That's what he wants.

623
00:28:00,499 --> 00:28:02,933
I didn't want to do this.

624
00:28:02,936 --> 00:28:05,870
Not to a family man.

625
00:28:05,873 --> 00:28:08,307
But I will.

626
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:12,035
Time to make a decision, Detective West.

627
00:28:12,038 --> 00:28:14,642
While there's still some of you left.

628
00:28:19,446 --> 00:28:21,979
No, no, no! Leave her out of it!

629
00:28:33,092 --> 00:28:34,926
What's wrong?

630
00:28:49,513 --> 00:28:51,113
He took Cisco!

631
00:28:56,194 --> 00:28:58,139
- Cicada took Cisco.
- What do you mean took him?

632
00:28:58,142 --> 00:28:59,289
- Took him where?
- I don't know.

633
00:28:59,291 --> 00:29:01,054
They jumped into a breach
right when I got here.

634
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,881
But a breach could take them anywhere.

635
00:29:02,884 --> 00:29:05,108
Cisco, can you hear me?

636
00:29:05,111 --> 00:29:07,542
Guys, can you hear me?

637
00:29:08,807 --> 00:29:11,207
Cisco, where are you?

638
00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:13,743
I don't know. My breach fritzed out

639
00:29:13,745 --> 00:29:15,378
and spat us out in a forest somewhere.

640
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:17,614
Can you breach out?

641
00:29:22,888 --> 00:29:24,421
It's not working.

642
00:29:29,895 --> 00:29:31,928
Cicada's dampening his powers.

643
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:33,825
Without a satellite I can't
pin point his location.

644
00:29:33,827 --> 00:29:35,031
I mean, in this state alone

645
00:29:35,033 --> 00:29:36,766
there's over 14 million acres of forest.

646
00:29:36,768 --> 00:29:38,403
All right, Black Forest
and Roanoke are closest.

647
00:29:38,405 --> 00:29:39,769
I'll start there.

648
00:29:39,771 --> 00:29:41,788
We're not gonna find
him in time, are we?

649
00:29:41,791 --> 00:29:44,091
Well, before you give up,

650
00:29:44,094 --> 00:29:45,660
- what kind of trees?
- What?

651
00:29:45,663 --> 00:29:48,278
In the forest, what
kind of trees, ask him.

652
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,019
Cisco, what kind of trees are they?

653
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:53,583
I don't know! I'm in a forest!

654
00:29:55,187 --> 00:29:57,520
What kind of trees, little one?

655
00:29:57,522 --> 00:29:59,522
- Pine trees, I think.
- Good.

656
00:29:59,524 --> 00:30:01,724
Some of them have pointy leaves.

657
00:30:01,727 --> 00:30:03,526
Ah, pointy....

658
00:30:03,528 --> 00:30:05,428
ash trees, of course.

659
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,964
All right, now I need
you to hold your breath.

660
00:30:07,966 --> 00:30:09,702
What? Why?

661
00:30:09,705 --> 00:30:11,301
Because I need to hear the forest,

662
00:30:11,303 --> 00:30:13,303
So, shh.

663
00:30:19,077 --> 00:30:20,710
Crickets.

664
00:30:20,712 --> 00:30:23,113
You hear this? Assuming
that's field crickets.

665
00:30:23,115 --> 00:30:25,215
They live in the soil.
Anyway, cross-reference

666
00:30:25,217 --> 00:30:27,350
field crickets with a high concentration

667
00:30:27,352 --> 00:30:28,752
of pine trees, ash trees,

668
00:30:28,754 --> 00:30:30,453
in an open field, and you have...

669
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:32,834
- Kolins Woods.
- On my way!

670
00:30:58,617 --> 00:31:00,444
Barry, you got to get out of there!

671
00:31:05,357 --> 00:31:07,557
We have to help him.

672
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:09,492
Barry?

673
00:31:13,398 --> 00:31:16,900
It takes time to hone your skills, Nora.

674
00:31:16,902 --> 00:31:18,803
You can't just skip rungs on the ladder

675
00:31:18,806 --> 00:31:20,170
or jump right to the big stuff,

676
00:31:20,172 --> 00:31:21,805
that's not how it works.

677
00:31:21,807 --> 00:31:24,741
Take a moment. Think before you act.

678
00:31:24,743 --> 00:31:26,647
Fix the problem the right way.

679
00:31:28,713 --> 00:31:30,170
I got it.

680
00:31:30,173 --> 00:31:31,581
I can fix this.

681
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:33,077
I've thought this through.

682
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,443
I won't mess it up this time.

683
00:31:34,446 --> 00:31:36,079
I promise.

684
00:31:36,082 --> 00:31:38,282
I trust you.

685
00:31:38,285 --> 00:31:39,651
Go.

686
00:31:46,097 --> 00:31:48,608
All these years in Central City

687
00:31:48,611 --> 00:31:52,434
spent defending metas
instead of ending them.

688
00:31:52,437 --> 00:31:55,672
Those days end now.

689
00:31:55,674 --> 00:31:58,007
Starting with you.

690
00:32:06,084 --> 00:32:07,784
Use this!

691
00:32:09,087 --> 00:32:11,221
Hey, Michael Myers,

692
00:32:11,223 --> 00:32:13,189
dampen this.

693
00:32:23,969 --> 00:32:26,035
No. No. No. No.

694
00:32:26,037 --> 00:32:27,686
Cisco's gone.

695
00:32:27,689 --> 00:32:29,088
Oh, my God...

696
00:33:20,892 --> 00:33:22,458
Cisco?

697
00:33:43,214 --> 00:33:44,600
He's alive.

698
00:33:44,686 --> 00:33:46,582
He's alive.

699
00:33:49,064 --> 00:33:50,253
Hey. Hey.

700
00:33:52,089 --> 00:33:54,523
Sorry. Sorry.

701
00:33:57,095 --> 00:33:59,595
Your daughter.

702
00:33:59,597 --> 00:34:01,731
She remembered there's
more than one way to

703
00:34:01,733 --> 00:34:03,655
open a breach.

704
00:34:03,658 --> 00:34:04,978
Figured Cicada wouldn't give up

705
00:34:04,981 --> 00:34:06,053
until Vibe was dead,

706
00:34:06,056 --> 00:34:08,990
so we gave him what he wanted.

707
00:34:08,993 --> 00:34:10,993
Thanks, fangirl.

708
00:34:10,996 --> 00:34:13,530
You saved my life.

709
00:34:13,533 --> 00:34:15,610
I did good?

710
00:34:15,613 --> 00:34:17,246
You did great.

711
00:34:24,298 --> 00:34:27,133
It's almost like you're really dead.

712
00:34:27,135 --> 00:34:29,135
Yeah.

713
00:34:29,137 --> 00:34:31,537
I almost really was.

714
00:34:34,842 --> 00:34:36,475
How the hell are we
gonna catch this guy?

715
00:34:36,477 --> 00:34:38,907
Not with our powers.
We know that at least.

716
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,308
We don't know much else either.

717
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:43,049
Variations in the timeline, they've...

718
00:34:43,051 --> 00:34:45,214
shifted the elements,
complicated the equation.

719
00:34:45,217 --> 00:34:46,819
- Now...
- Not all those elements

720
00:34:46,821 --> 00:34:48,139
are bad though.

721
00:34:48,142 --> 00:34:50,122
You could be the new
element that saves us.

722
00:34:50,124 --> 00:34:51,816
You could be the reason we catch Cicada.

723
00:34:51,819 --> 00:34:54,193
I must admit, Miss Nora here pulled

724
00:34:54,195 --> 00:34:55,828
the rug right under from Cicada.

725
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:57,496
Woof, alley-oop, huh?

726
00:34:57,498 --> 00:34:59,427
- Very impressive.
- Yeah, that's the only

727
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:00,730
fake death we're gonna see around here

728
00:35:00,732 --> 00:35:01,934
'cause you're sticking around

729
00:35:01,936 --> 00:35:03,526
until you pay us back every cent.

730
00:35:03,529 --> 00:35:04,837
Well, I have to say, prospect

731
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:06,338
of another mystery with Cicada

732
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,807
puts a little pep in my step.

733
00:35:07,809 --> 00:35:09,508
Also, that breach device you used to get

734
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:10,843
in and out of places, I suppose

735
00:35:10,845 --> 00:35:12,245
that's under lock and key right now?

736
00:35:12,247 --> 00:35:13,765
That's at the bottom of the ocean

737
00:35:13,768 --> 00:35:14,867
as far as you're concerned.

738
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,270
Well, then I'm staying!

739
00:35:16,273 --> 00:35:17,472
- Great!
- Course you are.

740
00:35:17,475 --> 00:35:18,684
I'm watching you, Holmes.

741
00:35:18,686 --> 00:35:19,852
Yes. Yes. Yes. Well, you'll learn a lot.

742
00:35:19,854 --> 00:35:21,187
- Good for you.
- Ow.

743
00:35:21,189 --> 00:35:22,674
All right, shall we, sidekick.

744
00:35:22,677 --> 00:35:23,789
I'll sidekick your face.

745
00:35:23,791 --> 00:35:25,424
Something tells me
those two are gonna be

746
00:35:25,426 --> 00:35:28,060
just great friends.

747
00:35:28,062 --> 00:35:30,062
So...

748
00:35:30,064 --> 00:35:33,032
You guys up for a family dinner night?

749
00:35:35,837 --> 00:35:37,269
Sure.

750
00:35:37,271 --> 00:35:40,206
Yeah. And then maybe after

751
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:42,775
we could help you move into the loft.

752
00:35:42,777 --> 00:35:44,518
I know you've been
kind of cooped up here,

753
00:35:44,521 --> 00:35:47,113
and now that Sherloque is
gonna need a place to stay

754
00:35:47,115 --> 00:35:49,615
I thought you could...

755
00:35:49,617 --> 00:35:52,518
crash with us.

756
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,254
I think it's a great idea, Nora.

757
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:58,791
Okay, thanks, yeah. Thanks.

758
00:36:00,528 --> 00:36:01,994
Let me get my purse.

759
00:36:01,996 --> 00:36:03,929
- Okay.
- This will be good.

760
00:36:04,899 --> 00:36:06,265
I think it could be just the thing

761
00:36:06,267 --> 00:36:08,134
to bring you two closer together.

762
00:36:09,636 --> 00:36:11,603
I really hope so.

763
00:36:25,219 --> 00:36:26,685
Hey.

764
00:36:26,687 --> 00:36:28,154
Taking Cisco out for some drinks

765
00:36:28,156 --> 00:36:29,688
in memoriam of Vibe.

766
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:32,358
- You wanna come?
- I'm okay, but thank you.

767
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,160
Anything you want to talk about?

768
00:36:34,162 --> 00:36:37,463
My dad wasn't really
the letter writing type.

769
00:36:37,465 --> 00:36:39,738
I feel like he would have
found some other way to tell me.

770
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,000
No luck with his work notes?

771
00:36:41,002 --> 00:36:42,468
No, I mean, these molecular models

772
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:44,170
are gibberish. There's gaps everywhere

773
00:36:44,172 --> 00:36:46,972
and some of these
compounds don't even exist.

774
00:36:46,974 --> 00:36:48,951
It's like his mind was the first to go.

775
00:36:50,311 --> 00:36:52,178
But, maybe I should
just listen to my mom

776
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:55,047
and forget about the past.

777
00:36:55,049 --> 00:36:57,583
Well...

778
00:36:57,585 --> 00:36:59,285
You left this behind.

779
00:37:00,521 --> 00:37:03,622
Sometimes the past is worth remembering.

780
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:06,559
Thank you.

781
00:37:22,176 --> 00:37:23,509
They don't exist

782
00:37:23,511 --> 00:37:25,678
because they're not supposed to.

783
00:37:52,748 --> 00:37:57,108
_

784
00:38:10,857 --> 00:38:13,858
So this is all I could remember

785
00:38:13,861 --> 00:38:15,692
about Cicada. It's not much, but...

786
00:38:15,695 --> 00:38:17,216
No. No. No, this is... This is great.

787
00:38:17,219 --> 00:38:18,485
I mean, every little bit we get

788
00:38:18,488 --> 00:38:19,954
helps build a profile on him.

789
00:38:19,957 --> 00:38:22,101
I will comb over this in the morning.

790
00:38:22,103 --> 00:38:24,737
You should go be with Cecile right now.

791
00:38:24,739 --> 00:38:26,572
Feel better.

792
00:38:26,574 --> 00:38:29,141
Wait. There's... There's one more thing.

793
00:38:29,143 --> 00:38:31,677
He made these comments

794
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:32,911
about family

795
00:38:32,913 --> 00:38:34,546
and cherishing them.

796
00:38:34,548 --> 00:38:37,216
And then the way he
picked up Jenna's blanket,

797
00:38:37,218 --> 00:38:39,918
and I got this feeling

798
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,288
when I looked in his eyes.

799
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:44,390
What... what kind of feeling?

800
00:38:44,392 --> 00:38:47,626
I think Cicada's a father.

801
00:39:07,048 --> 00:39:08,714
Hello, Orlin.

802
00:39:17,191 --> 00:39:20,159
Any progress?

803
00:39:20,161 --> 00:39:22,261
She's not coming out of it.

804
00:39:32,139 --> 00:39:33,841
Let me see it.

805
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:42,881
It's not healing.

806
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,352
Doesn't matter.

807
00:39:46,354 --> 00:39:48,287
You can't keep doing this.

808
00:39:48,289 --> 00:39:49,421
You have to stop.

809
00:39:49,423 --> 00:39:51,423
Not until I'm finished.

810
00:40:23,357 --> 00:40:24,552
Oh, hi.

811
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:26,457
I'm just looking for my purse.

812
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,527
I'm about to have
dinner with my parents.

813
00:40:28,529 --> 00:40:29,862
It's on the chair.

814
00:40:29,864 --> 00:40:31,063
In the Cortex.

815
00:40:31,065 --> 00:40:33,031
By the mannequin.

816
00:40:33,033 --> 00:40:35,236
Right. Thanks.

817
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:36,935
Well, enjoy the couch.

818
00:40:36,937 --> 00:40:38,237
Nora.

819
00:40:40,174 --> 00:40:42,608
Can you help me with something?

820
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:44,510
I've been wondering...

821
00:40:44,512 --> 00:40:46,712
You. You've traveled back into all these

822
00:40:46,714 --> 00:40:49,014
great moments of your
parent's lives, right?

823
00:40:49,016 --> 00:40:52,025
Some wonderful, some dangerous.

824
00:40:52,028 --> 00:40:54,420
Most not as dangerous as...

825
00:40:54,422 --> 00:40:56,855
punching a falling satellite, right?

826
00:40:56,857 --> 00:40:58,190
And yet...

827
00:40:58,192 --> 00:41:00,626
that is the moment when you made

828
00:41:00,628 --> 00:41:03,429
the decision to act,

829
00:41:03,431 --> 00:41:05,631
altering the course of history forever.

830
00:41:05,633 --> 00:41:07,566
That decision...

831
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:11,503
Did you come to it on your own?

832
00:41:16,727 --> 00:41:18,510
Of course you did!

833
00:41:18,512 --> 00:41:20,412
Right? No, of course you did.

834
00:41:20,414 --> 00:41:21,647
You're Excess!

835
00:41:21,649 --> 00:41:23,782
The temptation...

836
00:41:23,784 --> 00:41:25,717
was too much, I'm sure.

837
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:27,252
It was.

838
00:41:28,589 --> 00:41:30,456
Well, please,

839
00:41:30,458 --> 00:41:32,424
forgive me. You have a dinner to go to.

840
00:41:33,427 --> 00:41:34,927
Good night.

841
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:48,673
