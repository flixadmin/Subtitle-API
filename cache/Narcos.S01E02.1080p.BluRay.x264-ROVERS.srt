1
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,363
<i>By the time I left Miami,</i>

2
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,842
<i>Americans were doing a couple hundred tons
of cocaine every year.</i>

3
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,450
<i>To satisfy American noses,
the narcos ramped up their operations.</i>

4
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,967
- Here, honey.
- Ah, thank you.

5
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,050
- Hey, is that the Bahamas?
- Hm?

6
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,085
Oh... Yeah.

7
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,049
That's beautiful.

8
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,484
<i>They were flying so many planes,</i>

9
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,882
<i>they needed a refueling stop
between Colombia and Miami.</i>

10
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,964
<i>So Carlos Lehder
bought an island in the Bahamas</i>

11
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,731
<i>as a transshipment point
for the drugs and money.</i>

12
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:33,567
<i>Turns out...
it was a damn good place to party.</i>

13
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,162
<i>It was modern day Sodom and Gomorrah,
with the three things Carlos liked most:</i>

14
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,768
<i>- sex, drugs, and Nazi sympathizers.</i>
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

15
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,729
Let's get down!

16
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,686
<i>The problem was
no longer demand... it was supply.</i>

17
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,286
We should be over the Amazon by now.

18
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:11,088
<i>From 10,000 feet, Colombia
was a paradise of untouched rainforest.</i>

19
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,602
<i>But things were different
on the ground.</i>

20
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,406
<i>Pablo and his partners built superlabs
the size of small cities.</i>

21
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:28,721
<i>From leaf to paste to powder,
they produced 10,000 kilos a week.</i>

22
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,847
<i>At 50 grand a kilo,
that's five billion dollars a year.</i>

23
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,161
<i>These guys weren't fuckin' around.</i>

24
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:45,126
<i>Pablo 's cousin Gustavo flew chemists in
from Germany to liquefy the cocaine.</i>

25
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,127
<i>They added it to liquor, to coffee,
and just to be funny...</i>

26
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,725
<i>they put it back in Coca-Cola.</i>

27
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,131
<i>¿Patrón?</i>

28
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,201
Looks good?

29
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,681
<i>Cocaine was no longer
hidden alongside products.</i>

30
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,127
This is going
to sell better than the original.

31
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,645
<i>It was the product.</i>

32
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,006
It's time to take Pablo's money.

33
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,527
<i>The narcos even
had their own drug-sniffing dogs.</i>

34
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,531
<i>Gacha bet Pablo that not even
a German scientist could fool his dog.</i>

35
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,728
- Search.

36
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,408
- What's happening? Look at that.

37
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,529
Your prize dog didn't even stop.

38
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,807
There's no coke in that boat.

39
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,927
Come here.

40
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:30,929
It's blended
right into the fiberglass hull.

41
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,571
Give me the money...
the cash!

42
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,961
Looks like you got taken
with this dog, brother.

43
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,087
- Hold this a moment.
- Oh, Marquessa, my dear...

44
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,485
It's OK, it's OK.

45
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,009
- Are you fucking crazy?
- What?

46
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,525
It's my dog.

47
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,560
Son of a bitch.

48
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,086
What happened?

49
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,606
You want to know what happened? Go look.

50
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,280
Pablo?

51
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,048
- Pablo, we have a motherfucking problem.
- Bastard murderer.

52
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,650
- He killed the dog.
- I don't give a shit.

53
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,883
If we don't resolve this problem,
we're all dead. Come on.

54
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,042
- Come on, man.
- Son of a bitch.

55
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,691
Let's see...

56
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,127
- This is the problem?

57
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,362
People are watching us, Pablo.

58
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,245
They're asking themselves
how two small businessmen

59
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,688
- suddenly came up with so much cash.
- Gustavo, brother...

60
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,570
just launder the money.

61
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:52,369
Make it look legitimate...
that's all.

62
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,482
Isn't that what Al Capone did?

63
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,051
- Al Capone?
- Al Capone.

64
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,164
You're a dumbass, Pablo.

65
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,641
- Al Capone is a terrible example.
- Why?

66
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,366
Because Al Capone
never had this much cash.

67
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,045
This is too much to launder.

68
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,366
Well, then...

69
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,167
let's buy a bigger washing machine.

70
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,804
<i>And that's what they tried first.</i>

71
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,844
<i>On paper, Pablo had
the most profitable taxi company ever.</i>

72
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,081
<i>He only had three cars,</i>

73
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:30,528
<i>but he was pulling in
more than five million dollars a week.</i>

74
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,082
<i>And Gacha had the most successful
emerald mine of all time.</i>

75
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,881
<i>He would inject bad stones with oil
to make them shiny,</i>

76
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,651
<i>then have his friends in Miami
buy the emeralds with drug money</i>

77
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,007
<i>and give them as gifts
to hookers in town.</i>

78
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,004
<i>Everybody was happy.</i>

79
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,402
<i>But no matter what they did,
they couldn't hide all that money.</i>

80
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,442
<i>It just kept coming in.</i>

81
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,840
You're spending too much cash, Pablo.

82
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,288
You have Picassos, Dalís, farms,

83
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,166
houses, apartments, boats, planes, cars...

84
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,011
I told you we have to fly low.

85
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,242
If you keep spending like that,
you're going to end up in <i>Forbes Magazine.</i>

86
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,641
And if that happens,
the government is going to have our asses.

87
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,882
Enough, Gustavo, enough.

88
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,088
What do you want me to say?

89
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,564
Bury it.

90
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,530
- How's that?
- Bury the cash.

91
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,728
And cut the bullshit.

92
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,891
Go on, pussy.

93
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,251
<i>- And that's what they did.</i>

94
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,527
<i>They buried it in fields...</i>

95
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:47,051
<i>they hid it in</i> caletas,
<i>hiding places in walls and ceilings.</i>

96
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,048
<i>They even stuck a million dollars
in Pablo 's mother's couch.</i>

97
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,164
Hey, Mom.

98
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,289
- I'm praying, Pablo.
- Just for a second.

99
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,246
Sit.

100
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,362
It isn't very comfortable, Pablito.

101
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,283
I'll buy you another sofa later.

102
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,569
Wouldn't it be better
if you put all this money in a bank, son?

103
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,324
No.

104
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,880
All bankers are bandits.

105
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,485
Really, honey?

106
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,682
<i>Pablo called this accountant "Blackbeard,"</i>

107
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,603
<i>not because he looked like a pirate,</i>

108
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,889
<i>but because his job was to map out
where the treasure was hidden.</i>

109
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,086
<i>But not even the pirate did the trick.</i>

110
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,322
<i>The problem was Colombia itself.</i>

111
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,449
<i>It was too small a country
for a fortune that big.</i>

112
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:52,606
<i>It was inevitable... someone, somewhere
would try to snatch the narcos' treasure.</i>

113
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,641
<i>Forbes Magazine</i> says...

114
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,847
that the narcos have more money

115
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,003
than the richest capitalist pig
in this country.

116
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,527
- Let me see?

117
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,763
If we kidnap someone in their family,
what are they going to do?

118
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,888
- Call the police?

119
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,802
Commander.

120
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,404
It says here that Gacha, "The Mexican,"
is the ninth richest man in the world.

121
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,403
I say we kidnap his son.

122
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,207
- He's a psycho maniac, comrade.

123
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,369
Plus, he's bought off half the military.

124
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,121
Well, the Ochoa brothers
are number 14 on the list.

125
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,521
Their sister Marta
goes to the university.

126
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,840
How about her?

127
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,366
I like that more.
The Ochoas are soft.

128
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,931
Wait a second.

129
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,963
What about Pablo Escobar?

130
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,929
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

131
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,810
<i>No one's crazy enough
to kidnap drug dealers, right?</i>

132
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,531
<i>But if you're thinking that, it's because
you're not familiar with M-19.</i>

133
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,361
<i>- M-19 was a communist guerrilla group</i>

134
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,727
<i>made up of college students
and intellectuals</i>

135
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,280
<i>who read too much Karl Marx
for their own good.</i>

136
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,209
<i>Their leader was
Ivan "the Terrible" Torres...</i>

137
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,011
<i>a history professor
who knew nothing about guerilla warfare,</i>

138
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,367
<i>but understood the power of symbols.</i>

139
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,522
<i>He broke into
the Quinta de Bolívar Museum</i>

140
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,650
<i>with his buddy Alejandro
and Alejandro's girlfriend, Elisa,</i>

141
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,089
<i>and stole a national treasure...
the sword of Simón Bolívar,</i>

142
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,051
<i>the mythic general who led Colombia
to independence from the Spanish empire.</i>

143
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,562
<i>These jokers even left a note:</i>

144
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,690
<i>"Bolívar, your sword
returns to the battlefield."</i>

145
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,042
<i>It was a stroke of genius...
a marketing stunt way ahead of its time.</i>

146
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,122
<i>And it made them famous overnight.</i>

147
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,442
<i>And I guess it went to their heads.</i>

148
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,081
What about Pablo Escobar?
He's the richest of them all.

149
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,202
Escobar gives money to the poor.

150
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,608
You're right.
Escobar is a man of the people.

151
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,011
He's all right with me.

152
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,730
OK, then.

153
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,206
- Let's do the Ochoas.

154
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:54,201
<i>March 13th, 1981,
the day they kidnapped Marta Ochoa,</i>

155
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,841
<i>was also the day the Lion
completed 100 trips to Miami.</i>

156
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,605
<i>- Hola.</i>

157
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,648
Good afternoon.

158
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,011
- Mr. and Mrs. Murphy.
<i>- Sí.</i>

159
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,249
Does the cat have any papers?

160
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,442
<i>- Sí.</i>
- Please.

161
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,130
Thank you.

162
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,481
Mm.

163
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,524
Excuse me a second, please.

164
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,610
Sir, this couple has no sanitary B-47 form

165
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,444
and no I-435
identifying papers, either.

166
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,568
Well, I guess he's talking about Puff.

167
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,530
Yes, sir.
They brought an American cat with them.

168
00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:00,290
Sure, but without the I-435, I can't
officially state that it is indeed a cat.

169
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,285
I also can't guarantee
that it's American.

170
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,849
Sir, I'm not trying
to make your life more difficult.

171
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,762
OK, sir.

172
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,367
My boss is not having a good day.

173
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,442
I think his wife left him.

174
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:30,649
Yeah, well, he's a little bit cranky,
so... how important is this cat to you?

175
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,211
Excuse me?

176
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,004
OK.

177
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,081
Come with me, please.

178
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,521
So... wait here, please.

179
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,445
And my boss will ask you
for this paper later.

180
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,129
How long is it gonna be?

181
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,401
I don't know.

182
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,883
- Pablo! Pablo!

183
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,088
<i>While I was trying to get into Bogotá,</i>

184
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,686
<i>Pablo was trying to get into politics.</i>

185
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,810
<i>When he said he was going
to be president of Colombia, he meant it.</i>

186
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,651
- Hello, Pablo.
- Hello, Valeria.

187
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,008
- This is my wife, Tata.
- Hello.

188
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,287
Don't worry.
Everything will be perfect.

189
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,204
I'm just not used
to these type of things.

190
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,725
Just be yourself.

191
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,921
Ma'am, it would be best
if you weren't here.

192
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,166
Look, Tata,
there are a lot of people here.

193
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,083
It might not be good for the baby.

194
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,251
Go to the house.

195
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,401
Where is this guy?
We've been waiting for hours now.

196
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,323
Maybe he's at <i>"terapia de pareja."</i>

197
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,890
What's that?

198
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,371
Couples counseling.

199
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,961
Right.

200
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,331
What're you doing?

201
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,402
Oh, I'm practicing my Spanish.

202
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,931
<i>Welcome to</i> Nuevos Tiempos.

203
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,449
<i>I'm Valeria Velez and I'm here with the
man known as "the Robin Hood of the poor"</i>

204
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,046
<i>for his generosity
with the poor of Medellín.</i>

205
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,282
<i>Yeah, you heard that right.</i>

206
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,081
<i>She just compared Pablo Escobar
to fucking Robin Hood.</i>

207
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,926
<i>- And in a way, she was right.</i>

208
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,809
<i>When you've run out of ways
to hide your money,</i>

209
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,326
<i>that's when you give it to the poor.</i>

210
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,448
<i>But I don't want to get ahead of myself.</i>

211
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,201
Tell us about your program,
"Medellín Without Slums," Mr. Escobar.

212
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,284
I was born in Rionegro,
not too far from here.

213
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,082
And I asked myself how a government
that exists for the people

214
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,970
can be so out of touch
with what they need.

215
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,725
Hospitals, social and athletic programs,

216
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,929
plus the construction
of 400 houses in this community.

217
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,971
I hear you told your mother that one day
you would be president of Colombia.

218
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,963
Do you have any political aspirations,
Mr. Escobar?

219
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,443
None at all.
My business takes up most of my time.

220
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,443
I will tell you one thing, Valeria.

221
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:20,721
For decades, our country has been led by
Lopez and other families that are wealthy

222
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,565
who made their fortune
off exploiting the poor.

223
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,970
<i>They don't know what
common people dream of, but I do...</i>

224
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,407
- Connie, you know who that is?

225
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,006
Bet he could get our cat
into the country.

226
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,725
I can't believe it.

227
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,961
They don't even know
he's a fucking drug dealer.

228
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,403
<i>- Thank you very much.
- Pablo! Pablo! Pablo!</i>

229
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,729
<i>At the time,
Pablo was just a blip on my radar.</i>

230
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,131
<i>I didn't know
I was about to be a blip on his.</i>

231
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,160
Well, we've been waiting for hours.
Thanks for coming out.

232
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,444
Uh, my wife's a little exhausted,
so here is the cat's vaccination--

233
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,045
Your passport.

234
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,001
I'm sorry?

235
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,883
Your passport, please.

236
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,330
<i>- Gracias.</i>

237
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,645
What do you do at
the United States Embassy, Mr. Murphy?

238
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,961
I am in, uh,
janitorial services.

239
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,287
Janitorial services.

240
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,885
Another one.

241
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,487
Your embassy must be very clean.

242
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:48,321
Oh, yeah.
You bet your ass it is.

243
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,086
Your cat's cleared.

244
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,204
Enjoy Colombia.

245
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,325
<i>And just like that, the narcos
had me on file the very first day.</i>

246
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,003
<i>As for Valeria Velez,</i>

247
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:31,210
<i>the journalist who first
interviewed Pablo... watch out.</i>

248
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,681
<i>She was as dangerous as M-19.</i>

249
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,483
Does your wife do it standing up?

250
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,849
- Aah!

251
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:58,766
Don't ever disrespect Tata.

252
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,961
- Do you hear me?

253
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:08,327
I'm sorry, Pablo...
I'm sorry.

254
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,205
Forgive me.

255
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,843
It won't happen again.

256
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,081
I promise.

257
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,408
How can I apologize? Huh?

258
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,525
Want to put it in my ass? Hm?

259
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,884
<i>You gotta give it to her.</i>

260
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,043
<i>- She saw Pablo coming a mile away.</i>

261
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,284
<i>And she got herself in just the
right place to take full advantage of him.</i>

262
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,331
<i>Not unlike my partner Javier Peña,</i>

263
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,210
<i>who figured the best way
to get inside narco information</i>

264
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,521
<i>was to hang out
with the same women they did.</i>

265
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,641
We get better every time we practice.

266
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,722
You're amazing, Javier.

267
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,605
Well...

268
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,804
don't go overboard.

269
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,564
It's the truth.

270
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,923
What can you offer me to drink?

271
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,287
Whiskey or tap water.

272
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,004
Water.

273
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,370
What you're missing
in this apartment is a woman.

274
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,329
It's fine the way it is.

275
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,602
Well, I wasn't offering.

276
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,286
Here.

277
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,521
If you were a client,
you would have paid me already.

278
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,004
- And you wouldn't know my real name.
- Don't take it the wrong way.

279
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,130
It's cash from Uncle Sam
for the information you never gave me.

280
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,724
Take it.

281
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,805
And my visa?

282
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,965
Give me something I can use
and we'll talk about it.

283
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,002
What are you doing this weekend?

284
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,170
- I'm going to Medellín.
- Work or play?

285
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,963
I have to take care of my child.

286
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,569
I can pay, too.

287
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,606
Those guys are richer
than Uncle Sam, Javi.

288
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,406
Come here.

289
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,202
- What?
- Give me a kiss.

290
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,769
Give me a kiss.

291
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,251
I guess I'll have to find another girl.

292
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,087
Good luck with that.
We're all going to Medellín.

293
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,288
Some of us are even going by plane.

294
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,169
Helena?

295
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,651
Helena.

296
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,050
Whose party is it?

297
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,610
- Oh, God! What was that?

298
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,846
That was like a .38.

299
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,888
- About four blocks away.
- Oh...

300
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,525
- Welcome to Bogotá.

301
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,410
- Should we do it under the bed?

302
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,528
Just one thing...
Who told you about this?

303
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,603
Mother Teresa of Calcutta.

304
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,924
<i>Pablo says they're
not going to pay a dime for Marta Ochoa.</i>

305
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,280
<i>Gustavo, too.</i>

306
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:48,161
<i>- And Jorge?
- No. Jorge doesn't agree.</i>

307
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,642
<i>- Then what?
- They're all going to a meeting.</i>

308
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,762
<i>At Las Margaritas.</i>

309
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,491
<i>- Everyone?
- Yeah, they'll all be there.</i>

310
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,245
<i>First day at the American Embassy.</i>

311
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,886
<i>- I met my partner...</i>
- Javier?

312
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,167
<i>...who introduced me to the DEA.</i>

313
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,964
Murphy, this is Weaver and Wisnicki.

314
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,008
These guys are R.I.P.
"Retired in Place."

315
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,003
- Eat me, Peña.
- Paid vacation's over, fellas.

316
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,360
Murphy and I are going to Medellín.

317
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,450
We'll telex the T-3 reports.
They go straight to Washington.

318
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,003
We are going to Medellín?

319
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,203
<i>- Then the Mil Group.</i>
- Jarheads... this is Murphy.

320
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,645
Murphy, this is Mil Group.

321
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,242
They advise Colombian military
on communist threats in the countryside.

322
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,731
Hey, those are classified.

323
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,924
- Now they're declassified.
- That's the ambassador's call.

324
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,490
No problem.

325
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,481
<i>And the last stop...
the ambassador's office.</i>

326
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,846
Why do you need this intel?

327
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,884
There's an unusual number of prostitutes
headed to Medellín this weekend.

328
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,650
Every high-end girl in Bogotá.

329
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,882
First class airfare,
five-star hotels.

330
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,162
The narcos are having a meeting
and then a party.

331
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,601
What does the M-19
have to do with this?

332
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:06,565
Somebody kidnapped Marta Ochoa.
Intel suggests it was M-19.

333
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,564
I need access to the M-19 files
to confirm.

334
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,961
If I find out one single dollar
of American taxpayer money

335
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,442
went to any of those hookers,
it'll be your ass.

336
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,682
OK, thank you.
One last thing, Ambassador.

337
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,966
Yes, Agent Peña?

338
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,766
I'm filing a visa request
for my informant. I need your signature.

339
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,530
You're bothering me.

340
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,563
She sure likes you.

341
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,404
Is your informant really a prostitute?

342
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,244
Everybody works for somebody.

343
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,123
<i>The very next day,
I was flying with Peña to Medellín,</i>

344
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,929
<i>Pablo's home turf.</i>

345
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,330
<i>First stop: Carlos Holguín School,
Colonel Carrillo's base of operations.</i>

346
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,600
- Good day, Major.
- Good day.

347
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:16,607
Your intel was good. The <i>traquetos</i>
are gathering at Las Margaritas.

348
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,524
I want you to meet
our new DEA, Steve Murphy.

349
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,250
Fresh meat.

350
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:29,610
<i>Then we went straight to a fancy
hotel where the narcos were about to meet.</i>

351
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:36,320
<i>The pictures I took that day
helped to ID guys for months to come.</i>

352
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,800
<i>- There was Carlos Lehder...</i>

353
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,401
<i>- ...the Ochoa brothers...</i>

354
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,401
<i>Fernando Galeano,
"the Wolfman"...</i>

355
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,610
Is that Gacha?

356
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,091
I've never seen him
with other traffickers.

357
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:18,729
<i>And last but not least...
Gustavo and Pablo.</i>

358
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,642
Get pictures of that fucker.

359
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,410
<i>They were all under one roof
and Peña got us there to document it all.</i>

360
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,726
<i>What we didn't know was
that we were witnessing the formation</i>

361
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,882
<i>of the famed Medellín cartel.</i>

362
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,770
<i>Pablo took advantage
of the kidnapping of Marta Ochoa</i>

363
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,242
<i>to bring ail the narcos together
for the very first time.</i>

364
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:53,371
<i>And then he proclaimed himself
their leader.</i>

365
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,529
What I propose at this moment, gentlemen,

366
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,491
is that we form an organization.

367
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:09,603
Pool our resources to train soldiers,
trade knowledge and buy information.

368
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:15,725
And so the message is clear,
we're going to name our group

369
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,041
"Death to Kidnappers."

370
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,884
What I propose:

371
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,730
I will manage all operational aspects.

372
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,406
All you need to do
is cover my expenses.

373
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,448
What you gentlemen will receive in return:
two things.

374
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,569
One... I promise to end the kidnapping.

375
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,121
Two... and at this moment,
the most important...

376
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,404
I promise to return
Marta Ochoa to her family.

377
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,080
<i>- Salud.</i>

378
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,687
Death to Kidnappers!

379
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,130
<i>We knew the meeting was over
when the hookers came to play.</i>

380
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,562
<i>Pena had finally
gotten one of his informants</i>

381
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,563
<i>right into the heart of the action.</i>

382
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,442
Come in! Enjoy! Ooh!

383
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,490
Don't forget La Quica!
Take care of him, too.

384
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,204
Sit down, my love.

385
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:27,491
- How are you?
- Good. And you?

386
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,528
I like your hat.

387
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,449
It looks good on you.

388
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,964
- Do you think so?
- Yes, it looks good.

389
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,280
Let's see.

390
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,044
- Very cute.

391
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,489
She should be here by now.

392
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,965
You think she slipped?

393
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,168
Nah, she's no dummy.

394
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,561
Maybe she's getting pretty for you.

395
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,926
Yeah.

396
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,288
Aah...

397
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,808
<i>Helena wanted a US visa so bad,</i>

398
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,724
<i>she was willing to do anything
to help our cause.</i>

399
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,649
<i>And that was a problem.</i>

400
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,202
- You're tired.
- Hm?

401
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,242
Let me relax you a bit.

402
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,044
So what happened at that meeting
that made you so tired?

403
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,407
What did you hear?

404
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,801
Nothing.
Just making conversation.

405
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,290
They're telling me
the girl left a long time ago.

406
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,763
- She's already dead.
- No, they wouldn't kill her at the hotel.

407
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,569
Then they killed her somewhere else.

408
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,449
She knew the risks.

409
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,488
If we're going back,
we go back now.

410
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,324
I want you to find the girl.

411
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,081
I can pick up a <i>sicario</i>.
You OK with that?

412
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,162
- I'm going with you.
- What about Fresh Meat?

413
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,561
Gonna stick around here
and see if she shows up, OK?

414
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,484
- Yeah, and where are you going?
- We're gonna go look for her.

415
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,085
That's it, guys.

416
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,370
- Guys.
Hey, what happened?

417
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,681
That little girl doesn't move.
Like a dead cow.

418
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,125
What, did you kill her?

419
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,128
It's my turn now.

420
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,646
- Where's the girl?

421
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,644
- Where's the girl, asshole?
- I don't know.

422
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,246
I don't know.

423
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,805
Choke him.

424
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,724
- Enough with the party.

425
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,051
I gotta rough this girl up.

426
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,248
Gacha wants to know
if she knows something.

427
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,846
Gacha's paranoid.

428
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,524
Wait a second...
I don't like them bruised.

429
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,007
Let me have a little more fun,
then I'll let her go.

430
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,560
- It's all right, boys.

431
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,051
This one's for all of you!

432
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,528
- Slap her around!

433
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,605
Any news on the radio?

434
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:28,241
- Should I tell him?
- No. Remember what Carrillo said.

435
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,288
Sorry, I don't speak English.

436
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:44,130
- How far is it?
- Come on, you piece of shit.

437
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,763
Helena?

438
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:50,291
I'm going to get you
out of here, OK? I promise.

439
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,889
All right. She's coming out.

440
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,164
Copy, Major.

441
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,366
Let's go, boys.

442
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,406
Hey, gringo.
Carrillo is calling. Come on.

443
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,207
<i>- No habla inglés,</i> huh?

444
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:26,927
¡Vamos!

445
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,049
Where the fuck's Peña?
<i>¿Dónde está Peña?</i>

446
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,360
Over there.

447
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,322
- How is she?
- Sedated.

448
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,964
- Is she gonna be OK?
- Physically, yeah.

449
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,247
Mentally, I haven't got a fucking clue.

450
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,886
- You left me behind on purpose.
- Look, man--

451
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,281
If we're gonna be partners,
I don't get left behind.

452
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,967
I didn't come all the way down here, Peña,
to sit on the fucking sidelines.

453
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:23,810
Whatever's going on here...
I'm in all the way.

454
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,484
Is that understood?

455
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,840
Understood.

456
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,889
I hope you know what that means.

457
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,649
<i>Pablo 's message
to the kidnappers was simple.</i>

458
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:54,681
<i>He was going to kill them, one by one,
until he got Marta Ochoa back.</i>

459
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:58,685
<i>Ivan "the Terrible" thought he could
hide in the jungle and wait it out.</i>

460
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,809
<i>Sooner or later,
he figured the narcos would cave in.</i>

461
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,329
<i>Big mistake.</i>

462
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,801
<i>M-19 didn't stand a chance.</i>

463
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:21,130
"Deliver Marta Ochoa safe and sound...
or your family is next."

464
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,163
Signed, "Death to Kidnappers."

465
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,569
Please! Please, let me go.

466
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,161
- Hurry up!
- Please, don't!

467
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:39,131
<i>Needless to say,
Marta Ochoa was released unharmed.</i>

468
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,049
<i>And 'the killing didn't stop.</i>

469
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:53,567
<i>Pablo had tasted blood,
and he liked it.</i>

470
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,207
Tell him to get a little closer.

471
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,965
A little closer. A little closer!

472
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,805
You know what, boss?
Go a little higher.

473
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,962
A little bit higher
and a little bit closer

474
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,963
so you can see the tree!

475
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,571
That's it.

476
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,725
Now a little bit higher
so you can see the little tree!

477
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,330
That...

478
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,885
That's it. Perfect.

479
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,161
DEATH TO KIDNAPPERS

480
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,810
A little more.

481
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,924
That's it! There you go.

482
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,568
- Much better.
- Yes, boss.

483
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:40,926
Didn't I tell you
not to let anyone into the park?

484
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,162
- I'll take care of it.
- Are you crazy or what?

485
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,208
Stupid asshole.

486
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,049
It's a woman with a baby.

487
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,840
Take a picture
so we can send it to the newspapers.

488
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,081
Do it.

489
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,168
Good day, ma'am.

490
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:59,445
- Good day.
- I'm sorry, but the park is closed today.

491
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,488
What do you mean the park is closed?

492
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,642
May I escort you out?

493
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,200
Why is it closed?
I come by here every day.

494
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:11,446
It's because there is a foul odor
and I don't want the child to get sick.

495
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,761
I thought I smelled something.

496
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,251
- Right?
- Yes.

497
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,049
Oh, look,
what a beautiful little baby.

498
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,600
Right, just like his dad.
Thank you very much.

499
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,729
- You must be proud.
- Yes, of course.

500
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,883
My wife and I
are having a baby very soon.

501
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,247
Oh, very good.
Congratulations!

502
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,250
I don't know if it's a boy or a girl,
but as long as it's healthy.

503
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:35,848
Yes, of course.
The most important thing is health.

504
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,927
<i>Sending the photos
of the hanging M-19 to the newspapers</i>

505
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,771
<i>gave Pablo an image of invincibility.</i>

506
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:47,091
<i>If he could do this
to the feared communists,</i>

507
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,810
<i>he could do it to anyone.</i>

508
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,971
<i>Ivan "the Terrible"
was quick to realize...</i>

509
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,122
<i>there was only one thing he could do.</i>

510
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,965
Hey, Don Pablo.

511
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,648
What do you want us to do
with this guy?

512
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,804
Should I kill him or What?

513
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,881
From what I can see,
you're not going to stop.

514
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,846
Here I am,
so you can finish what you started...

515
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,961
but with the sword of Bolívar.

516
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,966
It's a very beautiful gift.
Thank you very much.

517
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,841
Stand up.

518
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:11,682
I guarantee no harm
will come to you or your family.

519
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,847
From now on,
we are going to work together.

520
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,006
Go in peace, brother.

521
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,369
Is that What I think it is?

522
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,050
You've gotta be kidding.

523
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:58,242
I want you
to run my day-to-day operations.

524
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,847
And you'll do what?

525
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,202
Liberate Colombia.

526
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,641
Welcome to the Medellín cartel.

527
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:38,525
<i>The narcos had their army,
but me and Peña had ours, too.</i>

528
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,331
<i>Many Colombians
like Major Horacio Carrillo</i>

529
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,404
<i>were so invested
in the future of their country</i>

530
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,529
<i>that they were ready
to do whatever it took to fix it.</i>

531
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:54,408
<i>This was a war that would shake
an entire country to its foundations.</i>

532
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:58,166
<i>And in the carnage...
mine would be shaken as well.</i>

533
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,609
<i>Even my wife, Connie,
wanted to help.</i>

534
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,122
<i>She got a job as a nurse
in a local</i> comuna.

535
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,851
<i>- She wanted to make a difference.</i>

536
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,571
<i>I guess she forgot we were in Colombia.</i>

537
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:14,803
Look, our <i>escolta</i> will drive me
there and back every day.

538
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,400
- Yeah.
- He'll wait outside all day.

539
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,609
You know the last time you were in church
is when we got married.

540
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:22,882
Well, I'm letting the Lord
back into my life.

541
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,041
Hey, stop right here.

542
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,729
Praise God.

543
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:45,291
Perdón.

544
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:52,127
I want that <i>escolta</i> watching
every inch of you at that <i>comuna</i> now.

545
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,529
Hey, did we leave the door open?

546
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:00,202
Oh, my God, Steve!

547
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,282
- Get back.

548
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,964
You stay right there
and don't move.
