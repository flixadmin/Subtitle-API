It's yours.

No, Barry, not that you. This you.

Cisco had the samples analyzed...

119
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,748
...and the proteins in the blood
were that of an adult...

...not a child.

121
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:41,753
But that means...

If the last five months have proven anything,
it's that anything can exist.

But to actually travel through time?

Well, the greatest minds in human history...

129

...put their collective genius towards
solving that puzzle.

130
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,740
So is it possible?

131
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,784
Yes, it's possible.

132
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:15,120
But problematic. I mean...

133
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:19,416
...assuming you could create the conditions
necessary to take that journey...

134
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,210
...that journey would be fraught
with potential pitfalls.

135
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,921
Novikov principle of self-consistency
for example...

136
00:08:25,088 --> 00:08:26,297
Wait, the what now?

137
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,842
If you travel back in time
to change something...

138
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:33,179
...then you end up being
the causal factor of that event.

139
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:35,390
-Like <i>Terminator.</i>
-Ah.

140
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:38,268
Or is time plastic? Is it mutable...

141
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:42,105
...whereby any changes to the continuum
could create an alternate timeline?

142
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:44,524
-<i>Back to the Future.</i>
-Oh.

143
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:49,279
-I saw that one too.
-"Doc Brown." Tremendous picture.

144
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,240
Right. So, what's the answer?

145
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:56,119
I might be a clever guy, but if you're
asking me to give you a theory...

146
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:59,456
...on how to travel through time,
I'm afraid I just can't do that.

147
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,167
There is someone else
you can talk to about this.

148
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:10,884
Danish?

149
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:15,388
Why do you have a blueprint
of the S.T.A.R. Labs' particle accelerator?

150
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:19,267
-Do you know anything about physics?
-Not a thing. Might as well be in Dothraki.

151
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:22,479
So, what more is there
with the S.T.A.R. Labs story?

152
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:27,025
The only new information is Wells admitted
he was warned of a potential disaster.

153
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:28,526
Yeah.

154
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,612
Why do you think he did that?

155
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,531
Because he's a good person?

156
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:34,866
-Is he?
-Yes.

157
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,368
He saved my friend's life.

158
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:41,122
He was struck by lightning
and Dr. Wells and his team kept him alive.

159
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:45,376
So your friend wouldn't need saving
if Wells hadn't zapped him in the first place.

160
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:49,214
-It was an accident.

192

...is a free-flowing highway
that intersects the physical world.

We live in the moments
between the on and off ramps.

195

Theoretically, to travel through time...

196
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:45,163
...one merely needs to find a way
onto the highway.

Okay. So you're saying that this is actually
possible, to travel into the future?

would be the Chicago World's Fair, 1893.
