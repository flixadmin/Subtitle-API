1
00:01:09,505 --> 00:01:10,505
Hey!

2
00:01:12,421 --> 00:01:13,755
What happened to him?

3
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,880
Where did you get that?
What are you doing here?

4
00:01:30,255 --> 00:01:31,630
I just want to go home.

5
00:01:33,338 --> 00:01:34,880
Maybe he's a returned POW.

6
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:46,463
Looks like you've been roughed up.

7
00:01:48,088 --> 00:01:50,421
I guess you could use something to eat.

8
00:01:50,505 --> 00:01:51,838
I'm fine, thanks.

9
00:01:51,921 --> 00:01:54,421
Nonsense.
Erna has a soft spot for fellas like you.

10
00:01:54,505 --> 00:01:55,838
Come along.

11
00:03:00,838 --> 00:03:03,380
Agnes, go and let Erna know.

12
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,380
Run.

13
00:03:15,005 --> 00:03:16,296
Where were you stationed?

14
00:03:23,963 --> 00:03:25,046
Eastern front.

15
00:03:27,213 --> 00:03:29,463
- Labor camp.
- Those people aren't human.

16
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:31,755
We should have won the war.

17
00:03:36,796 --> 00:03:38,546
Do you have a place to sleep?

18
00:03:46,213 --> 00:03:48,463
Tell your brother
to get the chamber ready.

19
00:03:49,046 --> 00:03:50,630
But just for a few days.

20
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,963
Until you're back on your feet.

21
00:03:54,005 --> 00:03:55,713
I know this sounds strange.

22
00:03:58,588 --> 00:03:59,963
But what year is it?

23
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:05,838
They did quite a job on you, didn't they?

24
00:04:08,838 --> 00:04:10,130
1921.

25
00:04:17,796 --> 00:04:19,213
1921...

26
00:05:51,171 --> 00:05:53,338
JUNE 24, 2020

27
00:05:53,421 --> 00:05:56,838
THREE DAYS UNTIL THE APOCALYPSE

28
00:06:29,588 --> 00:06:31,463
I think we're a perfect match.

29
00:06:33,796 --> 00:06:35,546
Never believe anything else.

30
00:07:10,088 --> 00:07:11,088
Yes?

31
00:07:11,505 --> 00:07:13,713
Mrs. Doppler called in. She's sick.

32
00:07:14,255 --> 00:07:15,630
What's wrong with her?

33
00:07:17,088 --> 00:07:18,130
She didn't say.

34
00:07:19,213 --> 00:07:20,213
Hold on.

35
00:07:23,213 --> 00:07:26,171
- You're Mr. Wöller, right?
- Yes.

36
00:07:29,005 --> 00:07:30,505
Then the pleasure is ours today.

37
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,005
- You do have a car, right?
- Mm-hmm.

38
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,630
Wonderful.

39
00:08:29,296 --> 00:08:32,630
CALL FROM
HANNAH KAHNWALD

40
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,046
Where did you get this?

41
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,296
- Who is this?
- It's complicated.

42
00:09:45,171 --> 00:09:46,713
Mom, why do you have that?

43
00:09:50,005 --> 00:09:51,630
Should I make us breakfast?

44
00:10:06,588 --> 00:10:08,255
What are we going to do with Mom?

45
00:10:09,755 --> 00:10:10,796
I don't know.

46
00:10:27,296 --> 00:10:28,588
What do you want?

47
00:10:32,296 --> 00:10:33,880
- Martha.
- Franziska.

48
00:10:33,963 --> 00:10:36,046
- What do you want?
- We have to talk.

49
00:10:42,005 --> 00:10:45,713
- What?
- If you expect an apology, forget it!

50
00:10:45,796 --> 00:10:47,005
You fucked up.

51
00:10:47,463 --> 00:10:50,380
But I shouldn't have said what I said.
We're even.

52
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,421
Am I supposed to babysit
while you make out?

53
00:10:55,713 --> 00:10:57,338
Why did you bring her along?

54
00:10:57,671 --> 00:11:00,046
My parents haven't been home in two days.

55
00:11:00,755 --> 00:11:02,213
I can't leave her alone.

56
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:07,338
Why is everyone acting so weird?

57
00:11:19,963 --> 00:11:23,588
- I want to know what's up.
- What? You want to go into the caves?

58
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,088
You can stay here.

59
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,463
You slept nearly 24 hours.

60
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:54,296
Who are you?

61
00:11:58,046 --> 00:12:01,338
People say Erna can't say no
to any stray dogs.

62
00:12:07,505 --> 00:12:08,880
I'm in the wrong place.

63
00:12:11,713 --> 00:12:12,963
This isn't right.

64
00:12:20,796 --> 00:12:22,421
I pictured you differently.

65
00:12:30,171 --> 00:12:31,713
Why did you just say that?

66
00:12:33,171 --> 00:12:34,255
What does it mean?

67
00:13:13,505 --> 00:13:15,838
<i>Sic mundus creatus est.</i>

68
00:14:22,671 --> 00:14:23,671
Can I help you?

69
00:14:26,046 --> 00:14:27,921
I'm looking for someone.

70
00:14:29,296 --> 00:14:31,838
She used to work here.
It was a while back.

71
00:14:32,463 --> 00:14:34,463
Tiedemann. Claudia Tiedemann.

72
00:14:36,421 --> 00:14:37,755
She used to run the plant.

73
00:14:37,838 --> 00:14:41,171
- Where can I find her?
- There's only one Tiedemann here.

74
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,463
Aleksander Tiedemann.
He runs the plant.

75
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,505
Aleksander Tiedemann?

76
00:14:48,963 --> 00:14:52,755
So that's why you didn't want to let
Ulrich Nielsen onto the grounds?

77
00:14:53,588 --> 00:14:55,838
After Fukushima
safety standards were raised.

78
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,630
I can't just let anyone stroll in here.

79
00:15:01,255 --> 00:15:05,671
His suspicion that his son might be
on the grounds was totally unfounded.

80
00:15:06,921 --> 00:15:08,880
You know about the door in the cave?

81
00:15:10,921 --> 00:15:12,796
It was installed in the 1980s.

82
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,463
It was already welded shut back then,
as a security measure.

83
00:15:16,546 --> 00:15:19,880
- It's still sealed shut.
- You know what I find strange?

84
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,505
Everyone who was born here stays.

85
00:15:26,255 --> 00:15:28,463
Seems odd, in a town of this size.

86
00:15:31,046 --> 00:15:32,130
What do you think?

87
00:15:33,505 --> 00:15:34,630
Why is that?

88
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:40,630
The nuclear power plant always took care
of people. There's work.

89
00:15:41,713 --> 00:15:43,296
Prosperity, security.

90
00:15:48,796 --> 00:15:50,463
That'll probably change now.

91
00:15:52,338 --> 00:15:53,546
When the plant closes.

92
00:15:57,255 --> 00:15:59,505
- You're not from here.
- No.

93
00:16:00,463 --> 00:16:01,463
Why?

94
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:05,005
You came to Winden in 1986.

95
00:16:08,255 --> 00:16:10,463
At the same time the boy disappeared.

96
00:16:10,963 --> 00:16:11,963
Mads Nielsen.

97
00:16:13,296 --> 00:16:14,796
Ulrich Nielsen's brother.

98
00:16:15,463 --> 00:16:17,213
No. It was a bit later.

99
00:16:18,505 --> 00:16:19,505
A few weeks.

100
00:16:22,171 --> 00:16:23,546
Why does that matter?

101
00:16:33,296 --> 00:16:34,796
It probably doesn't.

102
00:16:51,463 --> 00:16:52,796
Just one more question.

103
00:16:53,796 --> 00:16:55,963
Why did you take your wife's name?

104
00:16:58,088 --> 00:16:59,213
I don't understand.

105
00:17:00,463 --> 00:17:02,713
Pretty unusual for the time.

106
00:17:05,796 --> 00:17:09,505
The Tiedemanns shaped this town.
Especially Regina's mother.

107
00:17:11,088 --> 00:17:15,046
Regina has no siblings.
We wanted to keep the name alive.

108
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:16,880
What's your real name?

109
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:23,546
Köhler. Aleksander Köhler.

110
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,255
Who's next on the list?

111
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,088
Mr. Wöller?

112
00:17:46,505 --> 00:17:47,921
Hannah Kahnwald.

113
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:04,546
<i>Why do you have a gun
and someone else's passport?</i>

114
00:18:07,213 --> 00:18:08,338
It's insurance.

115
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,755
What do you mean?

116
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,671
Someone needs
to keep both things hidden.

117
00:18:20,713 --> 00:18:22,296
You're blackmailing someone?

118
00:18:23,963 --> 00:18:25,130
Who are you?

119
00:18:28,963 --> 00:18:29,963
Who I am?

120
00:18:34,005 --> 00:18:35,005
Who are you?

121
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,880
Hannah?

122
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,505
I'm sorry.

123
00:18:53,338 --> 00:18:55,130
But we have to tell someone.

124
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:03,796
Thanks for getting here so soon.
I know none of this makes sense, but...

125
00:19:04,921 --> 00:19:06,713
This is Jonas. He...

126
00:19:07,296 --> 00:19:10,171
He's much older,
and he knows where my Jonas is,

127
00:19:10,255 --> 00:19:11,546
and where Ulrich is.

128
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,171
You're the man from the hotel
Regina talked about.

129
00:19:28,671 --> 00:19:29,921
Who are these people?

130
00:19:38,421 --> 00:19:40,255
This man here. The priest.

131
00:19:41,338 --> 00:19:42,880
Do you know who he is?

132
00:19:43,671 --> 00:19:44,713
That's Noah.

133
00:19:46,546 --> 00:19:47,713
You know him?

134
00:19:50,296 --> 00:19:51,796
What do you know about him?

135
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,005
- He's one of them.
- What is all this?

136
00:19:57,505 --> 00:19:58,505
One of whom?

137
00:20:02,171 --> 00:20:03,213
Sic Mundus.

138
00:20:04,463 --> 00:20:05,463
The travelers.

139
00:20:06,671 --> 00:20:07,671
The travelers?

140
00:20:09,255 --> 00:20:10,963
<i>Sic mundus creatus est</i>?

141
00:20:12,338 --> 00:20:15,171
What are you talking about?
You knew all of this?

142
00:20:15,796 --> 00:20:17,755
The time travel?

143
00:20:18,796 --> 00:20:21,005
There's something you should both see.

144
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:38,671
Okay.

145
00:20:47,505 --> 00:20:49,421
You want to go in there?

146
00:20:51,255 --> 00:20:55,796
After four kids disappeared here?

147
00:21:07,213 --> 00:21:10,713
You stay with me.
Do what I tell you. Okay?

148
00:21:27,463 --> 00:21:31,713
WINDEN MUNICIPAL LIBRARY

149
00:21:44,463 --> 00:21:45,463
Excuse me.

150
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,130
I am interested in...

151
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,630
the town's history.

152
00:21:50,921 --> 00:21:54,796
Where can I find articles and publications
from the past 30 years?

153
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,546
It's all been digitized.

154
00:22:02,713 --> 00:22:04,255
And where do I find that?

155
00:23:02,171 --> 00:23:03,171
Excuse me.

156
00:23:04,671 --> 00:23:06,130
Where's the keyboard?

157
00:23:07,546 --> 00:23:08,588
There isn't one.

158
00:23:19,505 --> 00:23:20,671
SEARCH

159
00:23:28,338 --> 00:23:29,338
CLAUDIA TIEDEMANN

160

CLAUDIA TIEDEMANN FIRST WOMAN
TO HEAD A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT

161
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:45,630
NUCLEAR POWER PLANT BOSS
DISAPPEARS WITHOUT A TRACE

162
00:23:52,755 --> 00:23:54,546
You informed her about the meeting?

163
00:23:56,171 --> 00:23:57,171
Yes.

164
00:23:58,588 --> 00:24:00,046
APPOINTMENTS

165
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:01,838
Anything about Hannah Kahnwald?

166
00:24:08,171 --> 00:24:10,171
Her husband killed himself last year.

167
00:24:11,296 --> 00:24:12,880
He hanged himself.

168
00:24:13,796 --> 00:24:17,713
Actually, no one here understood
why she married him. She's very pretty.

169
00:24:18,421 --> 00:24:20,505
She could've had any man she wanted.

170
00:24:20,588 --> 00:24:23,421
It was rumored she had an affair
with Ulrich Nielsen.

171
00:24:26,046 --> 00:24:27,880
Did Mrs. Nielsen know about it?

172
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,171
May I ask you something?

173
00:24:45,755 --> 00:24:47,005
Go ahead.

174
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:51,088
How did you get this position?

175
00:24:52,755 --> 00:24:54,046
Special task force.

176
00:24:54,796 --> 00:24:56,338
Did you volunteer for it?

177
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:02,880
Oh, yes.

178
00:25:04,838 --> 00:25:05,838
I did.

179
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,796
IS THIS MAN A CHILD MURDERER?

180
00:25:37,338 --> 00:25:39,630
She told Tronte and me what to do.

181
00:25:43,046 --> 00:25:44,130
Claudia Tiedemann.

182
00:25:45,005 --> 00:25:47,838
She knew the exact time
things would happen.

183
00:25:49,213 --> 00:25:53,005
It made no sense. And yet
it was the only thing that made sense.

184
00:25:54,546 --> 00:25:55,755
You knew all this?

185
00:25:59,046 --> 00:26:00,046
Michael?

186
00:26:00,338 --> 00:26:01,546
Mikkel? Ulrich?

187
00:26:04,088 --> 00:26:05,088
You knew it all?

188
00:26:12,796 --> 00:26:13,796
This here.

189
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,963
She gave it to us.

190
00:26:17,005 --> 00:26:19,380
It's all in there. About the children...

191
00:26:19,838 --> 00:26:21,130
Who disappeared when.

192
00:26:22,088 --> 00:26:23,588
Things about time travel.

193
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:27,005
Symbols and tables
we don't really understand.

194
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,505
The last few pages were ripped out.

195
00:26:32,171 --> 00:26:34,130
Does Katharina know about this?

196
00:26:38,171 --> 00:26:39,505
You have to tell her.

197
00:26:47,921 --> 00:26:48,921
Okay.

198
00:26:52,505 --> 00:26:53,588
But I'll do it.

199
00:26:59,796 --> 00:27:01,588
REGINA AND ALEKSANDER TIEDEMANN
TO WED

200
00:27:04,421 --> 00:27:07,588
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED
REGINA TIEDEMANN - ALEKSANDER TIEDEMANN

201
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,755
WALDHOTEL WINDEN OPENS

202
00:27:16,921 --> 00:27:20,046
WALDHOTEL WINDEN CLOSED

203
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,005
EGON TIEDEMANN

204
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:35,130
NO TRACE OF MADS NIELSEN
CHIEF INSPECTOR EGON TIEDEMANN...

205
00:27:40,671 --> 00:27:43,630
FORMER WINDEN CHIEF INSPECTOR
FOUND DEAD IN HIS APARTMENT

206
00:27:43,713 --> 00:27:44,838
ON JUNE, 261987

207
00:27:57,338 --> 00:27:58,338
Excuse me.

208
00:27:59,463 --> 00:28:01,213
Can you print from these things?

209
00:28:47,171 --> 00:28:48,921
<i>Sometimes I dream about him.</i>

210
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,380
Jonas.

211
00:28:57,213 --> 00:28:58,921
It feels so real.

212
00:29:00,796 --> 00:29:02,255
As if he were still alive.

213
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:06,755
How can it feel so real if he's dead?

214
00:29:09,546 --> 00:29:12,713
Do you think he knew something?
Before he disappeared?

215
00:29:14,588 --> 00:29:15,671
What do you mean?

216
00:29:17,838 --> 00:29:20,838
That he found out something
he wasn't supposed to.

217
00:29:22,255 --> 00:29:24,005
The door has to be here.

218
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,880
Where are we going, Charlotte?

219
00:30:01,171 --> 00:30:02,838
Tell me where we're going.

220
00:30:05,046 --> 00:30:07,421
Damn it, Charlotte! Where are we going?

221
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:10,338
It's easier to explain it
if I show it to you.

222
00:30:15,255 --> 00:30:16,838
Have you found them?

223
00:30:22,463 --> 00:30:23,630
You found them.

224
00:30:28,421 --> 00:30:31,005
We found them. Both of them.

225
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:35,421
They're not dead. They're alive.

226
00:30:40,671 --> 00:30:41,921
But they're not here.

227
00:30:45,255 --> 00:30:46,463
What does that mean?

228
00:30:48,088 --> 00:30:50,046
They're alive, they're not here?

229
00:30:51,796 --> 00:30:54,046
You better see it with your own eyes.

230
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:22,671
What's she doing here?

231
00:31:23,963 --> 00:31:25,421
What is this, Charlotte?

232
00:31:26,255 --> 00:31:29,880
You said you thought Mikkel
was in the cave. You were right.

233
00:31:29,963 --> 00:31:33,380
Mikkel was in the cave,
and Ulrich was looking for him there.

234
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,421
But there was something in the caves.

235
00:31:41,921 --> 00:31:43,130
A kind of

236
00:31:43,213 --> 00:31:45,380
crack in time.

237
00:31:56,088 --> 00:31:57,588
Are you screwing with me?

238
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,505
What is all this bullshit?

239
00:32:07,421 --> 00:32:09,713
- Where are Mikkel and Ulrich?
- It's true...

240
00:32:09,796 --> 00:32:11,171
Shut your face!

241
00:32:11,796 --> 00:32:13,921
No one asked for your opinion.

242
00:32:16,755 --> 00:32:17,880
Charlotte is right.

243
00:32:21,796 --> 00:32:22,796
Another one.

244
00:32:25,505 --> 00:32:28,171
Who are you? Her new lover?

245
00:32:30,088 --> 00:32:31,088
I'm Jonas.

246
00:32:33,921 --> 00:32:34,921
Her son.

247
00:32:39,296 --> 00:32:40,296
Your grandson.

248
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,463
She says it's shaking.

249
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,963
- What is it?
- There's someone there.

250
00:33:54,838 --> 00:33:56,088
Go, go!

251
00:33:56,421 --> 00:33:57,755
Flashlights off!

252
00:34:18,921 --> 00:34:20,338
Bartosz?

253
00:34:28,213 --> 00:34:29,505
Why are you here?

254
00:34:31,171 --> 00:34:32,463
What the fuck?

255
00:34:34,338 --> 00:34:35,713
What are you doing here?

256
00:34:42,671 --> 00:34:46,380
<i>My husband is caught in the 1950s,
and my son in the 1980s?</i>

257
00:34:47,963 --> 00:34:51,046
You left him there
because Mikkel is your father. Right?

258
00:34:52,921 --> 00:34:53,921
Yes.

259
00:35:01,796 --> 00:35:03,130
I can't believe it.

260
00:35:03,421 --> 00:35:05,671
That you're buying all his bullshit.

261
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:09,463
What do you want? Huh?

262
00:35:12,505 --> 00:35:13,505
Money?

263
00:35:14,296 --> 00:35:16,255
Can you talk to the dead? Hm?

264
00:35:19,088 --> 00:35:20,088
Katharina.

265
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:24,463
I was there.

266
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:26,838
I saw him.

267
00:35:28,963 --> 00:35:29,963
Mikkel.

268
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,838
You've all lost it.

269
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:24,630
No.

270
00:38:05,463 --> 00:38:08,546
If you have anything to do
with this shit...

271
00:38:09,005 --> 00:38:10,005
Fuck you!

272
00:38:10,546 --> 00:38:13,130
Stop it. Just tell us why you're here!

273
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:22,838
Come here.

274
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,630
What is that?

275
00:38:38,005 --> 00:38:39,005
What is it?

276
00:38:39,255 --> 00:38:41,255
Hands off. It's not your business.

277
00:38:44,713 --> 00:38:47,380
If you have anything to do
with Mikkel or Dad...

278
00:38:49,213 --> 00:38:50,296
I'll kill you.

279
00:38:55,046 --> 00:38:56,671
What are we going to do now?

280
00:38:58,505 --> 00:38:59,671
We're taking it.

281
00:39:01,338 --> 00:39:02,338
And him?

282
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:05,421
We'll leave him here.

283
00:39:06,505 --> 00:39:08,171
Maybe he'll change his mind.

284
00:39:10,421 --> 00:39:11,421
Shit!

285
00:39:12,463 --> 00:39:13,546
You can't do that.

286
00:39:16,088 --> 00:39:17,088
Martha!

287
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,630
You can't do that!

288
00:39:20,921 --> 00:39:22,588
Hey. Fuck... Hey!

289
00:39:23,713 --> 00:39:24,713
Magnus!

290
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:26,588
Hey! Magnus!

291
00:39:28,213 --> 00:39:29,213
Magnus!

292
00:39:36,671 --> 00:39:38,546
<i>What's your take on all of this?</i>

293
00:39:39,255 --> 00:39:40,921
We have a man-eating cave.

294
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,838
An NPP with a boss
who is obviously hiding something.

295
00:39:46,505 --> 00:39:48,755
An inspector who has gone into hiding.

296
00:39:49,171 --> 00:39:51,046
And a town full of people

297
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:53,505
who lie, cheat and betray one another.

298
00:39:55,421 --> 00:39:59,380
And who are all only concerned with
concealing what's really going on here.

299
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:02,838
So, Mr. Wöller?

300
00:40:04,713 --> 00:40:06,130
What do you make of it?

301
00:40:11,255 --> 00:40:12,588
I don't know.

302
00:40:19,296 --> 00:40:20,838
What happened to your eye?

303
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,380
Okay.

304
00:40:33,963 --> 00:40:34,963
But...

305
00:40:36,171 --> 00:40:37,713
you can't tell anyone.

306
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:43,130
Well...

307
00:40:44,505 --> 00:40:46,088
- Last summer...
- Watch out!

308
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,963
Interesting.

309
00:41:25,213 --> 00:41:27,505
TEACHER'S LOUNGE
PLEASE KNOCK

310
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:40,546
1986, 1986...

311
00:41:48,796 --> 00:41:51,880
KAHNWALD, MICHAEL - 6B

312
00:41:51,963 --> 00:41:53,213
6b.

313
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,630
6b...

314
00:41:57,130 --> 00:41:58,296
6b.

315
00:41:59,588 --> 00:42:01,546
CLASS REGISTER

316
00:42:39,463 --> 00:42:40,546
It's not open yet.

317
00:42:56,713 --> 00:43:00,046
It's going to take
nearly 32 more years until it opens.

318
00:43:01,421 --> 00:43:02,671
So you know about it?

319
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:11,671
They're waiting for you.

320
00:43:17,796 --> 00:43:18,796
Who?

321
00:43:19,755 --> 00:43:20,796
Sic Mundus.

322
00:43:23,046 --> 00:43:26,630
You want to go home, right?
That's what they say, anyway.

323
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:28,880
Who are "they"?

324
00:43:33,171 --> 00:43:34,171
The travelers.

325
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:53,838
And now?

326
00:43:58,380 --> 00:43:59,505
It doesn't matter.

327
00:44:01,296 --> 00:44:03,546
Everything will happen as it always has.

328
00:44:06,796 --> 00:44:08,421
Then why are you here?

329
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:14,630
- He said there's a loophole.
- Who?

330
00:44:15,796 --> 00:44:16,796
Adam.

331
00:44:16,963 --> 00:44:17,963
Who's Adam?

332
00:44:19,505 --> 00:44:21,005
The leader of Sic Mundus.

333
00:44:21,421 --> 00:44:22,838
The people in the photo,

334
00:44:23,421 --> 00:44:24,463
the travelers?

335
00:44:25,046 --> 00:44:26,046
Yes.

336
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:29,838
He wants the last cycle to begin.

337
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:31,630
In three days.

338
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:34,463
I have to stop him.

339
00:44:40,213 --> 00:44:41,505
That's why I'm here.

340
00:44:47,088 --> 00:44:48,130
She tried.

341
00:44:53,588 --> 00:44:56,088
But in the end she became
what she wanted to fight.

342
00:46:41,505 --> 00:46:43,338
What are we doing here?

343
00:46:47,130 --> 00:46:48,296
You're one of them.

344
00:46:50,213 --> 00:46:51,213
A traveler.

345
00:46:52,755 --> 00:46:53,755
Not yet.

346
00:46:54,755 --> 00:46:55,880
But I will be soon.

347
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,921
It must be strange for you to see me here.

348
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:28,130
Especially after our last encounter.

349
00:47:31,755 --> 00:47:34,171
You've already made my acquaintance.

350
00:47:46,213 --> 00:47:48,588
You finally want answers, don't you?

351
00:49:17,921 --> 00:49:21,630
ALEKSANDER KÖHLER?

352
00:50:17,296 --> 00:50:20,880
<i>SIC MUNDUS CREATUS EST</i>

353
00:51:53,088 --> 00:51:55,546
What are you doing here?

354
00:51:57,296 --> 00:51:58,630
What is that in there?

355
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:02,880
You knew it was here!

356
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:06,380
You were

357
00:52:07,338 --> 00:52:09,046
lying to us the entire time.

358
00:52:10,171 --> 00:52:11,171
What is that?

359
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:13,963
What is that?

360
00:52:17,046 --> 00:52:22,796
They say it's a piece of God.

361
00:52:27,338 --> 00:52:30,296
But it's really a piece of the devil.

362
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:43,130
The prophecy.

363
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:46,671
How did it arise?

364
00:53:03,296 --> 00:53:04,880
The book. Who wrote it?

365
00:53:17,255 --> 00:53:19,921
Whoever it was who wrote it...

366
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:24,838
had already seen the future and the past.

367
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:38,171
What will happen next?

368
00:53:43,838 --> 00:53:47,171
Adam will send him on the path
that has been predetermined for him.

369
00:53:49,755 --> 00:53:51,671
So the last cycle can begin.

370
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,213
You must have a lot of questions.

371
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:15,171
Traveling doesn't leave one unscathed.

372
00:55:17,421 --> 00:55:20,630
The human body isn't equipped for it
on a continual basis.

373
00:55:28,338 --> 00:55:29,463
What is this place?

374
00:55:35,963 --> 00:55:37,088
Shall we begin?

375
00:55:38,796 --> 00:55:43,255
I don't want to begin anything.
I want this to finally end. All of it!

376
00:55:44,421 --> 00:55:46,338
Don't worry. It will end.

377
00:55:47,338 --> 00:55:48,546
That is inevitable.

378
00:55:49,921 --> 00:55:50,921
Your end.

379
00:55:52,046 --> 00:55:53,046
My end.

380
00:55:55,546 --> 00:55:58,255
Upon closer examination, everyone's end.

381
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:10,380
Who are you?

382
00:56:21,421 --> 00:56:23,171
Don't you know?

383
00:56:43,338 --> 00:56:44,338
That can't be.

384
00:56:46,671 --> 00:56:47,671
I am you.

385
00:56:52,588 --> 00:56:55,130
Every stone is once again
where it belongs.

386
00:56:56,255 --> 00:56:58,755
Everyone in the place
they were destined to be.

387
00:57:03,755 --> 00:57:05,838
Now all that's needed is a little push.

388
00:57:06,505 --> 00:57:08,755
