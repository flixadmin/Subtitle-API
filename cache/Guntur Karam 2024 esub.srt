Hey!

Ranga, what's that?

26
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,400
It's our warehouse!

27
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:04,650
Hey!

28
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,110
-Hey!
-Hey, who is that?

29
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,100
-Brother, take this.
-What's going on?

30
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,260
Beat those idiots to a pulp!

31
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:11,220
-Catch them!
-Hey, move!

32
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,190
Hit them!

33
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,390
Where are you off to? Come here!

34
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,110
-You…
-Hey!

35
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,600
How dare you hit my brother!

36
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,360
-Hey!
-Brother…

37
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,140
How dare
you touch my brother-in-law!

38
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,230
You…

39
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,400
Lenin!

40
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,770
Hey, Lenin! Lenin!

41
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,850
Lenin…

42
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:54,180
Lenin! Hey, Lenin.

43
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,180
Nothing will happen to you.

44
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:57,940
-What have you done?
-I didn't expect this to happen.

Hey!

46
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:04,020
I will not spare those bloody rogues
who harmed my brother!

Lenin, you will be fine.

If anything happens to my brother,
you will be done for!

00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,190
Brother…

52
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:17,760
-Lenin, get up! Lenin!
-Don't spare them.

53

00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,610
Come on, my horse, let's go.

61
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:31,050
-Come on, my horse, let's go.
-Grandpa!

62
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,270
{\an8}AFTER FEW YEARS

63
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:37,010
-We will look at the files later.
-Just say Kata's here!

64
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,400
Bless me, sir.

65
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,050
{\an8}I have relied on you
for twenty-five years.

66
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,600
{\an8}I have become an MLA twice.

67
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,310
{\an8}I have sold half my assets.

68
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,140
{\an8}I heard we will be getting
the Law Ministry this time.

69
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,510
{\an8}With your blessings…

70
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,050
{\an8}I will get down to the job, sir.

71
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,220
Only someone like him,
who can request without inhibition,

72
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,900
will emerge in politics.

73
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:00,900
What do you say, Madhu?

74
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,800
-You know me well, sir.
-But only someone like me,

75
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:06,680
who can decline
without hesitation, will stay on top.

76
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,550
My daughter gets the ministry this time.
You can relax.

77
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:12,190
What has she
accomplished so far, sir?

78
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:16,300
{\an8}Married twice, gave birth to two,
and let go of one. Is that it?

79
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,480
{\an8}"Why was her firstborn abandoned?"

80
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,230
"Where is he? What is he up to?"

81
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,440
If I ask such questions
in front of the press…

82
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,260
you will make the headlines,
and I will make my way to the cabinet.

83
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,480
{\an8}Well, you need to stay alive
for that to happen.

84
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,940
"I, Vyra Vasundhara,
as the Minister of State for Law,

85
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:42,810
{\an8}shall discharge my duties
faithfully and conscientiously.

86
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,680
{\an8}Without fear, bias, or prejudice,

87
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:49,860
{\an8}in accordance with
the Constitution and Law,

88
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:54,220
{\an8}I shall do right by all manner of people,
and I solemnly swear in the name of God. "

89
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,690
-Did you get the papers ready, Pani?
-Yes, sir.

90
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,150
Why bother him now
after twenty-five years, sir?

91
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,810
I am not keen on doing this either.

92
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,430
Has she asked?

93
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,560
How her is former son and so on?

94
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,600
Actually, I'm overcome with love
for my grandson, and I want him here.

95
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,430
You probably think
you can still carry him.

96
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,770
He is more than six feet tall now.

97
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,260
His name is Ramana…

98
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,390
but he's as hot and spicy
as Guntur pepper to touch.

99
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,850
Pepper bales, loading trucks…

100
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,350
It's a world in itself.

101
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,610
And he's the king of that world.

102
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,760
He is already in great form, waging wars
and brandishing swords in his kingdom.

103
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,850
We shouldn't dig our own graves, sir.

104
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:06,220
He might be a king there,

105
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:07,980
but he is no more
than a son here.

106
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,550
We will manage. Call him.

107
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,480
Should I call him home, sir?

108
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,980
If we call him home, we will have
to entertain him until he leaves.

109
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,020
Call him to the office.

110
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,180
We can get up
and go once our job is done.

111
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,190
Okay, sir.

112
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,890
-Okay.
-Dear…

113
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,860
-Grandpa.
-What is the status?

114
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:31,220
I just had my breakfast.

115
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,100
I also had my coffee.

116
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,860
In a while, Mom will also leave
for the government office.

117
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,140
Correct? Yeah.

118
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,440
Bye, Grandpa.

119
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,310
He makes me wonder…

120
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:46,860
Is it necessary to call the other guy?

121
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:49,890
He makes me feel certain
that it is actually an emergency.

122
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:57,150
{\an8}SUBURB OF GUNTUR

123
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,940
-Who is it, Dad?
-It's Pani.

124
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,980
He's been continuously calling me
for the past ten days.

125
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:06,810
"Is Ramana coming to Hyderabad?"

126
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,390
Why don't you go and ask him?

127
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,440
No way!
You know he is short-tempered.

128
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,900
-He will shout at me.
-Why shouldn't he?

129
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,430
He was disowned by his mom
when he was just ten.

130
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,020
Do you expect him to be cheerful?

131
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,550
That's not temper.

132
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:22,220
That's anguish.

133
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,390
Guntur chili powder.

134
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,060
See… it's red and spicy to look at.

135
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,060
Once it touches your tongue,

136
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:38,310
there's no way you can stop your tears.

137
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:42,400
He is no different.

138
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,720
He seems harsh
but is actually sweet.

139
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,480
Ask him yourself.
You'll know how sweet he is.

140
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,720
{\an8}What do we ask him?

141
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,310
{\an8}His mom is calling him.

142
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,720
{\an8}Asking him to meet her is wrong.
Telling him not to is also wrong.

143
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,440
{\an8}I dice with death!

144
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,010
What are you looking at?

145
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,050
We got to move three full loads of chili.

146
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,600
Nerli Route seems to be good.
Take the same route.

147
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,720
-Okay.
-Call me as soon as you get there.

148
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,720
-Okay.
-"We didn't want to disturb you at night. "

149
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:09,900
If you come up with such lame excuses,
I will flay your skin, morons!

150
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,810
Go! Get going!

151
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:12,940
Let's go.

152
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,220
What?

153
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,360
Well…

154
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,050
Pani has been asking
if you have started for Hyderabad yet.

155
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:25,650
Should I go?

156
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:28,300
I'm not able to say yes
because I know they are not fair people.

157
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,680
Of course, there is nothing
to say about you.

158
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,470
Is that a yes or a no?

159
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,730
If I knew that,
why would I stretch so much?

160
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,970
-Hey, Samba.
-Yes?

161
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,300
Do you think she will recognize me?

162
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,470
Bro…

163
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,310
-Is there enough diesel in the car?
-Tank's full, bro.

164
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:08,650
What is the address?

165
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,650
Abids, Jandal Party Office, Hyderabad.

166
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,060
I was told that
anyone would guide you there.

167
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,550
{\an8}JANDAL PARTY

168
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,390
-Are the papers ready?
-Yes, sir.

169
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,180
I hope there are no spelling mistakes.

170
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,140
She divorced her husband
and abandoned her son.

171
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:24,940
She remarried and had another son.

172
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,400
The first son has no right to her assets.

173
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,020
This statement is a mistake in itself and
you're asking me for spelling mistakes?

174
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:31,470
His name is Ramana.

175
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:32,860
Show it to everyone.

176
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,970
-Has nobody seen him in all these years?
-We made a mistake.

177
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,520
This is not a mistake, sir.
It's a blunder.

178
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,970
I have had enough of you.
Give it to me. Come!

179
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,600
{\an8}RAMANA

180
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,060
<i>Spicy and pungent!</i>

181
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:00,900
{\an8}<i>Stinging chili powder!</i>

182
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,890
My left eye is a bit weak, man!

183
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,550
{\an8}Come here.

184
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,600
{\an8}You are…

185
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,140
Are you thrilled to see me?

186
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,520
Did your heart rate go up?

187
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,300
{\an8}Did you feel like whistling?

188
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:51,800
It's Ramana.

189
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,350
You look like a hero, sir!

190
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,060
What's the buzz here?

191
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:01,230
The old man is turning eighty, sir.

192
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:02,350
You know…

193
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,140
Most useless things last long.

194
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,480
So much hubbub for his birthday!

195
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,760
What will you do when he dies?

196
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,390
Break open the earth?

197
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,890
That was deep, sir.

198
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,440
Where is Pani?

199
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,520
He is waiting in there, sir.

200
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,720
-This is his obligation.
-Yes, sir.

201
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,020
-What else can he do besides wait?
-Yes.

202
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,150
Mom!

203
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,230
Mom!

204
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,680
Sir, that way…

205
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,100
Sir?

206
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,220
Why is he blocking my way?

207
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:00,860
That way, sir.

208
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:02,900
Doesn't he know what she is to me?

209
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,010
Mother?

210
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:06,560
She was called "sister" when she was
younger. Now, they call her "mother. "

211
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:07,890
Go, get an appointment first.

212
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,400
He talks a bit too much.

213
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,560
What are you looking at?
Will you hit me?

214
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,940
Just wondering if I should kill you.

215
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,220
Whoa!

216
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:27,480
Sir!

217
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:28,980
Son…

218
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,270
This way.

219
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,360
Come.

220
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,050
Coffee? Tea?

221
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:35,980
Is there a cup in your hand?

222
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,310
Only papers, right?

223
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,260
Give me a pen.
I'll sign and leave.

224
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,390
You better read it before signing, sir.

225
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,730
I should be killing you.

226
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,940
What could be so disruptive?

227
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:53,610
"Don't claim a legacy. "
You don't need it.

228
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:57,050
"Don't use the surname. "
You have your paternal surname anyway.

229
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,260
In short, you have no relation
with this family.

230
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,560
As if it has existed all these years!

231
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:04,060
In agreement, a signature…

232
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,730
When you part ways from
your husband, it's called a divorce.

233
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,970
When you disown your son,
what's the term for it?

234
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,220
Did you think of a name?

235
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,690
If yes, ask her to come and tell me.

236
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:14,980
Why just one?

237
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,600
I'll put a thousand signatures.

238
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,690
How is she still his mother?

239
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:24,720
If he wants, let him see her
when she is on TV.

240
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,430
He doesn't have a mother,
and he won't be getting one now.

241
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,480
Go, tell him.

242
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:32,600
-What if he doesn't agree?
-Destruction…

243
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,510
I will destroy him.

244
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,430
Ensure that emphasis
is placed on "destruction. "

245
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:43,640
If we place emphasis on it,
he'll probably not sign the paper, sir.

246
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:48,010
No, I mean, why call him here
yourself and then provoke him?

247
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,510
If he realizes we are in need,
he may raise his price.

248
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,690
We must keep him at a distance
and get the work done.

249
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,900
Yes.

250
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:01,850
When we ask for votes,
we even enter huts.

251
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,940
Once we win, do we allow the voters
to come into our homes?

252
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:07,220
Correct.

253
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,810
It's the same with him.

254
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,150
While he is still under the illusion
of seeing or meeting his mother,

255
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:16,520
we should get the job done.

256
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,150
Go, tell him.

257
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,520
Which one? About the voters, sir?

258
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,890
-What I told you before that.
-Okay, sir.

259
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:23,690
I got it, sir.

260
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:56,980
I got it signed, sir.

261
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,680
Why do you take the trouble, sir?
Let me check this for you.

262
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:02,810
-Oh…
-Give it here.

263
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,860
Sorry, sir!

264
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:10,060
LOOKING FORWARD TO THE DESTRUCTION
YOU WILL CREATE

265
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,360
It's just a signature.
Why are you laughing?

266
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:25,850
The old man will kill me. Shut up!

267
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:29,760
Hey!

268
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,010
-What happened? Tell me.
-Sorry, sir. He wrote,

269
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:34,390
"Looking forward to the destruction
you will create. "

270
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,810
He has emphasized on the word…

271
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,600
"destruction. "

272
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,390
What's happening?

273
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,220
{\an8}JANDAL PARTY

274
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,930
It's falling down!

275
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,480
-Careful!
-Move back!

276
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,560
Get out of here!

277
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:14,730
Oh, God!

278
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:18,390
<i>His name is Ramana…</i>

279
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,690
<i>but he's as hot and spicy</i>
<i>as Guntur pepper to touch. </i>

280
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:44,100
<i>It stings! This boy's chili powder!</i>
<i>Business with him is a roller coaster</i>

281
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:50,680
<i>Hot and spicy is his chili powder</i>
<i>Business with him is a roller coaster</i>

282
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,510
<i>In every nook and cranny</i>
<i>Whispers of his tales abound!</i>

283
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,010
<i>No one dares to step out of line</i>
<i>Because of him</i>

284
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,100
<i>Hey, there's no one who doesn't know him</i>

285
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,800
<i>Hey, he looks all glorious</i>
<i>But is good at battering, mother promise!</i>

286
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:03,100
<i>When he strikes, brain freezes</i>
<i>And they forget the PIN code</i>

287
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,180
<i>Fair!</i>

288
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,600
<i>Hey, crazy!</i>

289
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:08,900
<i>Stinging!</i>

290
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:12,940
<i>Hey, he's like a stinging slap!</i>

291
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,400
<i>Fair in complexion</i>
<i>With mind-blowing speed</i>

292
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,810
<i>A stinging burn</i>
<i>He is highly inflammable</i>

293

<i>Everybody, make way</i>
<i>Leader on the way</i>

<i>Ain't got no time to play</i>

<i>No one to account for</i>

298
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,360
<i>No one to endorse for</i>

299
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:46,850
<i>A burden loaded by others</i>
<i>Why should I carry it on my shoulders?</i>

<i>Slow-cooked spicy biryani</i>
<i>Red chili half tandoori</i>

<i>Make your stamp on Guntur</i>

<i>I am silence infinite</i>

305
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:16,060
<i>A bit of selfishness and a bit of virtue</i>
<i>I am love-matter with a mix of these</i>

306
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,800
<i>Hey, hold it, beauty</i>
<i>Hold the pestle high</i>

307
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:40,640
<i>Bring it down one after one</i>
<i>And pound it to your maximum</i>

308
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,730
<i>Pound it!</i>

309
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,510
<i>Hey, one chili per pound</i>
<i>Sacrifice it to the stone</i>

00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:26,550
<i>My destiny is a colorful pattern</i>

318
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,550
<i>I may be sad</i>
<i>But won't stop the celebration</i>

319
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:33,550
<i>My own fort of laughter</i>
<i>Why should I destroy it?</i>

320
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:38,390
<i>Slow-cooked spicy biryani</i>
<i>Red chili half tandoori</i>

321
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:43,230
<i>With lemon soda and a cigarette</i>
<i>Make your stamp on Guntur</i>

322
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:48,060
<i>Slow-cooked spicy biryani</i>
<i>Red chili half tandoori</i>

323
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:53,300
<i>With lemon soda and a cigarette</i>
<i>Make your stamp on Guntur</i>

324
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:14,770
Mom!

325
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,060
Ramana is here!

326
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:17,260
What?

327
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,300
Ramana is here!

328
00:23:18,390 --> 00:23:20,470
What are you saying?
I can't hear you! Come again!

329
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,230
{\an8}Mom, Ramana is here.

330
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,360
{\an8}If you could shout it from upstairs,
why bother rushing down?

331
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,860
Your wife cannot hear.

332
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,020
{\an8}He's already at the door.
He would come in anyway.

333
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,850
{\an8}If the door is shut,
he will go wherever he wants.

334
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,610
Hey, Ramana. How did it go?

335
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,510
-Count or deal?
-Drop.

336
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,680
{\an8}Hey, you never get a life in cards.
Nor wisdom in life.

337
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:41,270
{\an8}Does context mean anything to you?

338
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,140
How is your mother?

339
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:45,440
Has she put on weight?

340
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,480
She is glowing
like a Goddess in a temple.

341
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,190
You should have performed <i>arti</i> then!

342
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:50,350
I didn't find the matches.

343
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:52,550
But you find packs of them
for lighting cigarettes.

344
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,550
Yeah, right.

345
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,800
I'm famished.
What did you cook?

346
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,390
Nothing special.

347
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,060
I have only made egg curry.

348
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:00,980
Aunty!

349
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,390
Bring the egg here.
I will eat it.

350
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,220
-What?
-One of your eyes doesn't work anyway.

351
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:10,180
Do these sunglasses
make it any better?

352
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,150
Damn!

353
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,980
You cannot handle my style.

354
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,980
Did she ask you
how you have been?

355
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,310
She broke down as soon as she saw me.

356
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,400
Really?

357
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:22,230
She said, "Why should you eat
your aunt's awful egg curry?

358
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,180
Stay back. I will make chicken for you. "

359
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,860
-Well, you should have!
-Oh!

360
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,300
I didn't want you to miss me.
So, here I am.

361
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,560
Hey, what is that half-hearted serving?
He's growing up.

362
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,890
-Eat this.
-Hey! You want to kill me with eggs?

363
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,980
Yeah, I cannot let go like your mother.

364
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:37,110
Hey! Allow him to tell us
what happened there.

365
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,610
You haven't given him a break
since he came back!

366
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,470
He only speaks once a year.

367
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,980
But when he does, he is on the dot.

368
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,940
It's not like they were
overcome with love.

369
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:48,180
They required my signature,
indicating I was nobody to them.

370
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:49,770
That's why they called me.

371
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,110
Hey, Samba.

372
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:54,510
Yes?

373
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:55,970
They say we shouldn't claim their assets.

374
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:57,730
Have we ever?

375
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,860
She won't see her son…

376
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,270
but sits in the office
behind closed doors.

377
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:05,440
Since she was so busy, I thought
I shouldn't bother. So, I didn't sign.

378
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,400
Hello, Mr. Satyam!

379
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,610
Go and play the right song
on your gramophone on this occasion.

380
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:15,930
It should suit the estranged husband
as well as the disowned son.

381
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:31,350
I can't tell who is laying eggs at home!
You or the chicken!

382
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,770
Didn't you like the <i>dosa, </i> sir?

383
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,850
-I don't feel good, Pani.
-Oh!

384
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:48,180
You never know when Kata Madhu
would create a nuisance.

385
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:49,850
True, sir.

386
00:25:50,770 --> 00:25:52,360
Why isn't he signing?

387
00:25:52,930 --> 00:25:53,890
After all, it's his mother.

388
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,480
In that case, call him,
saying his mother wants to see him.

389
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,550
Hey!

390
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:12,860
Do I ever drink soda?

391
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,150
Sorry about that.

392
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,520
You use water, right?
I'll get it.

393
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:18,850
Uncle!

394
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,010
Uncle! That's water.
Here, take this.

395
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,260
One minute.

396
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,690
Hey, I prefer an omelet!

397
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,300
Where is your mind at?

398
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:44,800
What is the problem?

399
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,350
There was a call from Hyderabad yesterday.

400
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,480
He was asked to come home this time.

401
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,520
Your son is drinking like a fish, Uncle.

402
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:56,360
By the time I took him some water,
he had finished a quarter.

403
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,970
If I take too long with the omelet,
he might even devour me!

404
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,440
-Don't tell him I told you this.
-Wait.

405
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,400
-Let me talk to him.
-Please, don't. He will kill me.

406
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,100
-Hey!
-Uncle…

407
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,300
Ramana.

408
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,190
Are you drinking?

409
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:14,050
Did you get a call
from Hyderabad?

410
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,360
Yeah.

411
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:16,760
What was it about?

412
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,360
They were pleased to see the grandson.

413
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:20,150
Now, they want to see the son.

414
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,480
You should go then.

415
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:24,220
For what?
They are closing doors on me.

416
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,690
Break down the doors.
You possess every right as a son.

417
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,050
Is that so?

418
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,680
You sit and gaze out of the window.

419
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,690
But expect me to go there
knocking down doors!

420
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,810
They say when you refuse a meal,
you stay hungry the whole day.

421
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:42,230
But if you reject your mother,
you will cry all your life.

422
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:45,150
She has left him,
but he doesn't let go of her.

423
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:48,390
He thinks she will scoop me up
as soon as I go.

424
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:49,610
What did you say?

425
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,190
Are you going there or not?

426
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,680
BASAVARAJU SARANGAPANI
B. A, B. L

427
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:56,110
ADVOCATE

428
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,180
I'm the boss here.

429
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,770
The moment I enter,
they wet their pants out of fear.

430
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,650
Sir! Welcome, sir.

431
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,760
-You are?
-I'm Mr. Pani's assistant, sir.

432
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:08,890
Don't you have a name?

433
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,060
I'm Balu, sir.

434
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,060
-This is?
-Mr. Pani's house, sir.

435
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,150
Hey, capture well.

436
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,060
I should have everyone floored.

437
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:17,150
And that is?

438
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:18,550
Mr. Pani's daughter.

439
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:21,270
Today's special is my home tour.

440
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,640
This is our tree.

441
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:24,310
Sister! That's a plant.

442
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:26,850
When I don't know it myself,
how would the others know? Keep quiet!

443
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,600
Tomorrow is my father's death anniversary.

444
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,010
It's Grandpa's!

445
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,900
Wasn't something
of Dad's coming up as well?

446
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,150
His birthday.

447
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,010
Both are special occasions.

448
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,550
Jeez!

449
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,050
Pani's daughter is quite ravishing.

450
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,600
Ravishing?

451
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,810
He has come to meet your dad.

452
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:49,890
He is not home.

453
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,140
We will wait.

454
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,720
Sure. Wait outside.

455
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:54,810
Hey, girl!

456
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,760
Look at my complexion.

457
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,680
Won't I get tanned sitting in the sun?

458
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,940
Oh, really?
Just a minute.

459
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:06,690
As if he is a rose!

460
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,310
Wear it in your hair.

461
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,230
So, is that how you speak to all girls?

462
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,020
Not unless they are extremely pretty.

463
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:18,720
What's your deal?

464
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,050
Not with you.

465
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,480
With your pop.

466
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,980
Pop? What do you mean by "pop"?
Can't you give him some respect?

467
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,390
I guess she is angry.

468
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,020
I offered it.

469
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,300
But he refused.

470
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,600
My goodness!

471
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,970
Green really suits her.

472
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,480
Who is this guy flirting so openly?

473
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:41,180
I spared him because
he's good-looking. Otherwise…

474
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:01,050
-What's the name though?
-Bala Subramanyam, sir.

475
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,600
Who wants yours?

476
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:05,270
Amukta Malyada, sir.
We call her Amuda out of love.

477
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,800
Why should you show any love?
Leave that to me.

478
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,650
Won't you give me at least that freedom?

479
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:10,650
Take it, sir.

480
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,800
Why is she in a sari?
What is the occasion?

481
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:16,720
She makes reels on social media.

482
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:18,270
She was in jeans yesterday.
Today, she is in a sari.

483
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,940
Could she be wearing a skirt tomorrow?

484
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,770
-Why do you ask, sir?
-I'll come again tomorrow.

485
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:22,970
Tomorrow is my weekly off, sir.

486
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:26,300
Mom! That's him.

487
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:33,650
Are there burglars in their house, Balu?

488
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,390
They are not allowing anybody in!

489
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,520
They won't even offer tea.

490
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,100
That's not the case, sir. This is
the first time they have seen a rowdy.

491
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:41,800
Sorry, sir.

492
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,220
What did I say earlier?

493
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,100
You said Mr. Pani's daughter is ravishing.

494
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:53,560
She's not just ravishing.

495
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,310
-She's delightfully ravishing.
-Son!

496
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,930
-Sir!
-Pani, we were just talking about you.

497
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,610
-Why did you make him sit here?
-Sir…

498
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,640
-Actually--
-Have you any sense?

499
00:31:00,850 --> 00:31:02,140
Please come, sir.
Let's go in and have some coffee.

500
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:03,270
-Pani…
-Yes?

501
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,060
Was it Mom who called me?

502
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:06,690
Yes, I swear.

503
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:08,050
We will have coffee there.
Let's go.

504
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,100
One minute. I will reverse the car.
Come with me.

505
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:13,230
Ammu!

506
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:16,890
The name is Ramana.

507
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,480
Remember it.

508
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:20,720
It will be of use
when you come to Guntur.

509
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,760
He has given you a nickname already.

510
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,100
Hey, it's done. Lift it.

511
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,360
Did he say
I was going to cause destruction?

512
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,930
Did he say I was waiting?

513
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,110
What did you write?

514
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:26,970
What did you say?

515
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,760
You know I would lie.

516
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:33,390
You know I am covering up.

517
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:40,940
He is your uncle.

518
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:43,470
-My daughter's--
-Second husband?

519
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,310
Boss, if you don't mind,
can I ask you something?

520
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:50,690
Please.

521
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:52,430
What did my mother see in you
that she married you?

522
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:57,270
-I condemn. Condemn.
-I don't know.

523
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:00,810
Grandpa! In what context
can we use "condemn"?

524
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:03,720
Your father can condemn him
for his question.

525
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:05,720
Who is this guy?

526
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:09,260
To this family and our constituency,
he is the only heir.

527
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:10,930
-Who is this gentleman?
-Your brother by relation.

528
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,050
You can go.

529
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,550
Hey!

530
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,350
Don't walk away in such a peculiar manner!

531
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:18,110
Weren't you taught
how to greet your elders?

532
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,720
-Namaste!
-I see!

533
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:33,360
You and your stupid
half-hearted greetings!

534
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,600
I condemn this!

535
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:37,270
I bless you. Now, get going.

536
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:41,140
All the characters are here.

537
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,180
But where is the main lead?

538
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,150
Have you locked her up inside?

539
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:50,260
Sign this first.
She will come.

540
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,430
Let her come first.
I will sign.

541
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,610
The other day, while he was at the office,
if only we had disciplined him properly…

542
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,270
You don't have it in you!

543
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,390
Hey!

544
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,560
You don't have to shout.
I can hear properly.

545
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,900
You are old and hard of hearing.

546
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:06,310
-I should be shouting.
-Who are you calling old?

547
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,300
Who…

548
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,970
-Father-in-law!
-Sir!

549
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,190
Be careful…

550
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,650
Who is old here?

551
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:16,020
Are you going to get up and dance
to prove that you are not old?

552
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:23,190
You want me to read it?

553
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,260
You want my signature?

554
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,810
I only sign autographs for my fans,
not just anyone and everyone.

555
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,230
Superb!

556
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:40,560
I guess he doesn't need any medicine.
He has stopped coughing all of a sudden.

557
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,060
Why bother the old guy, sir?
Why don't you just sign it?

558
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:11,970
There is a love story going on here.

559
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:15,140
I should know whether
it's a one-sided or two-way situation.

560
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:17,470
I won't sign until then.

561
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,680
Why do you keep provoking him, sir?

562
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,850
In my opinion, it was wrong
to talk to him in the first place.

563
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:03,050
Fine, you did.

564
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:06,680
She has disowned him for 25 years.

565
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:08,110
You should have done the same.

566
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,800
That won't do.

567
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:13,690
He should stop believing
that my daughter is his mother.

568
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,350
Or we should make him stop?
That is why…

569
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:19,650
it's imperative he signs the document
saying he is in no way related to us.

570
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:22,720
That way, my grandson will have
no hurdles. He will become an MP.

571
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,730
Ramana will confine himself to Guntur.

572
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:26,150
Madhu will be out of power.

573
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:29,300
The requirement is yours,
and the signature is his.

574
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:30,720
How am I concerned?

575
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:32,110
Because Pani…

576
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:35,600
Venkat Swamy never takes
no for an answer.

577
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:39,060
Whoever dared to say no to me is dead.

578
00:36:44,350 --> 00:36:48,550
SHRI KANAKADURGA CHILI YARD

579
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,470
Hi, sir.

580
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,260
Hey, Balu.

581
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,610
What are you doing here?

582
00:36:58,270 --> 00:36:59,440
-Hey, Samba!
-Yes?

583
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,440
Didn't I tell you?

584
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:02,010
That's Pani's daughter.

585
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,720
Remember me?

586
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,230
Well, you told me…

587
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:15,190
"The name is Ramana. It will be of use
when you come to Guntur. "

588
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,940
That is why…

589
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:18,940
Oh!

590
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:21,430
-Hey, Yakub!
-Sir?

591
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:23,440
I'm beginning to blush.

592
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,230
-Go, bring three cups of tea.
-Yes.

593
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:32,850
I refused to sign that day.
Did the old guy trouble this Pani guy…

594
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,440
They must have tortured him.

595
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:38,480
He's not in the
best situation, sir.

596
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:40,550
-Is he gone?
-Not yet, but…

597
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,760
-Dad!
-Dear, what happened?

598
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:43,720
Don't cry.

599
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,520
Why are you crying?

600
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,560
-Losing a job is okay.
-Calm down.

601
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,140
But if it costs me my life,

602
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:51,940
should I laugh instead of crying?

603
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:53,680
You can always find another job.

604
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,060
Don't fret about it.

605
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:59,560
Who will offer a job to a lawyer
ousted from the Law Minister's office?

606
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,470
Don't worry.

607
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,550
When she sneezes, she turns more red.

608
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,560
Very tender.

609
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:11,690
Yes.

610
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:12,650
Where are you put up?

611
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:14,100
Star Hotel.

612
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,060
There are no-star hotels
around here!

613
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:18,860
Star Hotel is just a name, sir.
It's actually a lodge.

614
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:21,050
It's difficult to stay in lodges
for someone so ravishing.

615
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:24,680
I was praising you.

616
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:29,760
My dad's lost job, monthly EMIs…

617
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,150
I can't handle this, Ramana.

618
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:37,190
She's in distress.
Why are you crying?

619
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,770
That's what I fail to understand, sir.

620
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,180
I'm not even attached to her family.

621
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:43,730
And yet, tears seem to flow in streams.

622
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,720
The chili here is pungent.
His eyes must be burning.

623
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:49,650
Oh! Makes sense.

624
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,400
What is this?

625
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,140
Just one signature.

626
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,010
Do you know
what the old guy has written?

627
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,890
I know, sir.
Actually, I was the one who drafted it.

628
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:25,310
You should forget your mother.
Isn't that all?

629
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,640
Like a boy going to a boarding school…

630
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,860
I don't understand
why you have to act so dramatic.

631
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:35,860
After all, your mother left you long ago.

632
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,050
Am I right?

633
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:52,190
Hey!

634
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,180
Did he tell you
why he didn't buy it from us?

635
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,350
Some guy offered him a discount
of ten thousand rupees on each load.

636
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:58,100
Did he say who?

637
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,640
Go, have your lunch.

638
00:39:59,980 --> 00:40:02,020
Before you reach the last course,
he will spill all the beans.

639
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,600
He has been buying red chili
from us for ten years now!

640
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,180
When some guy offered you a discount…

641
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:09,850
"Madam, I have this offer.
What shall I do?"

642
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:12,600
Shouldn't you have asked me that?
Idiot! Don't let me hit you!

643
00:40:13,430 --> 00:40:14,800
You want to be consulted
about chili in the curry…

644
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:17,770
as well as chili in the truck.

645
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:18,760
What did you say?

646
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,150
Nothing.

647
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:22,440
You are playing my mouthpiece as well.

648
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,860
I just wanted
to play the listener this time.

649
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,510
That's it.

650
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,770
Why are you being so gentle?

651
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:34,770
Hit him so hard that he divulges the name
of his mistress in front of his wife!

652
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:40,350
Give me his phone.

653
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:47,150
This is the guy who stopped him
from buying chili from us.

654
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:48,760
-Who is it?
-Hey!

655
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:52,270
Touch him, and I will see your end!

656
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,140
You were saying something, Uncle?

657
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,610
Stay there.

658
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:59,400
If I don't come there in ten minutes
and burn you all up,

659
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,730
I will change my name from Marx!

660
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:05,190
Changing name and place at this age
on the Aadhar card and ration card

661
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:06,360
is a big headache.

662
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:08,650
Hey, Samba!

663
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:09,650
Yes?

664
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,270
Put him in the vehicle.

665
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,650
Let's go and say hello to Uncle Marx.

666
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:22,940
Uncle!

667
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,690
You burned down our warehouse
and sent my dad to jail.

668
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,360
You got your elder brother killed.

669
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:28,970
Don't panic. I got him.

670
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,430
But you are still vengeful.

671
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,850
That's why I have come to settle this
once and for all.

672
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:43,190
The vehicle is here.
Where is the boy?

673
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,600
{\an8}Admit that it was wrong
to snatch our business.

674
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:48,400
{\an8}The boy himself will come to you jumping.

675
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,520
Himself?

676
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:52,520
Are you going to wait
until I fall at his feet?

677
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:53,860
You bloody…

678
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:55,890
Right!

679
00:41:58,560 --> 00:41:59,440
Hey!

680
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,980
You want to monopolize
the chili business?

681
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:05,220
Don't we have the load or a truck?

682
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:09,810
Today, Satya is going to lose his son
in addition to his estranged wife!

683
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,230
I want him at my feet.

684
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,010
I will see how he will exit
from my compound.

685
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:30,350
-Let's thrash him! Don't spare him.
-Come on! Let's go!

686
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:33,190
Hit him!

687
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,760
Excellent!

688
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:55,180
Hit him!

689
00:42:56,060 --> 00:43:00,480
<i>Hey, you blow my mind away!</i>

690
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:03,310
Come here.

691
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,480
Come to this side.

692
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:05,980
<i>Hey!</i>

693
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:20,860
<i>A warm desire enters my heart</i>
<i>And throws me off my feet</i>

694
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:26,300
Bravo!

695
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:20,220
<i>Hey, you blow my mind away!</i>

696
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,510
Uncle, stop sitting around.

697
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:18,980
Lie down. I will explain.

698
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,550
Uncle!

699
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,560
Something has been bothering me
since I came.

700
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,600
Why have you put up a tent in winter?

701
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,470
Well, it's your money and your pleasure.

702
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:38,640
How dare he?

703
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:40,690
Hey! Why are you walking away?

704
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:42,730
His father has been
pestering me with calls.

705
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:43,770
Where is he?

706
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:46,190
Where the heck is he?

707
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,550
Uncle!

708
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:52,720
-Shut it!
-What?

709
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:06,430
<i>Hey, you blow my mind away!</i>

710
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:23,050
Move!

711
00:46:38,930 --> 00:46:41,850
Our car was crushed under the shed.
A shard of tile landed on my head.

712
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:42,890
Oh, God!

713
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:48,980
Is your car insured?

714
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:51,300
The mechanic is my guy.
He will get it ready in two days.

715
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:54,220
What is your story?

716
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:56,430
Didn't you say it yourself

717
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:59,390
that girls like me cannot stay in lodges?

718
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:00,940
So…

719
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,060
So…

720
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,260
So? You walk in with your suitcases?

721
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:08,260
There are no rooms here.

722
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:09,900
Hey, be quiet.

723
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,560
You are obedient.

724
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,440
You will come up in life.

725
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:19,610
Listen.

726
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:22,400
My aunt doesn't appreciate people
standing around.

727
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,360
Yes.

728
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:25,810
Go and stay in the room
under the staircase.

729
00:47:25,890 --> 00:47:27,220
-What?
-Yes.

730
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:28,470
My clothes are there.

731
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:30,260
Which room doesn't have your clothes?

732
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:32,350
Burn them up,
and half the problem will be solved.

733
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:35,270
Sure, set them on fire. It's your
dad's money. She's got nothing to lose.

734
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:36,640
He has given you a room. Go.

735
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:40,100
Let's go.

736
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:46,650
What is it?

737
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:48,180
My accommodation?

738
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:49,650
-Your accommodation?
-Yes.

739
00:47:50,390 --> 00:47:52,220
-You are a man.
-Yes, sir.

740
00:47:52,310 --> 00:47:54,110
-You can stay anywhere.
-True.

741
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,810
Make sure you don't enter the rooms.

742
00:47:56,730 --> 00:47:57,610
Sir?

743
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,050
-This is your bedroom?
-Exactly!

744
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:01,760
This is my balcony.

745
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:03,600
What about the toilet?

746
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:05,970
He said, "It's disgusting
to do it in the house.

747
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:07,890
Do your business under some tree. "

748
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:09,400
-Who?
-Who else?

749
00:48:09,730 --> 00:48:10,980
My harasser, Ramana.

750
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:14,940
How come she hasn't called me yet?

751
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:16,770
Will she take it easy if I relax?

752
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:17,970
Let me send her a photo.

753
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:20,760
Is it your dad?

754
00:48:21,310 --> 00:48:22,310
What did he send?

755
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:26,560
Does he want us to buy this from here?

756
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:28,550
He says he will hang himself
if he doesn't get the signature.

757
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,550
Cheap! He is not going to sign.

758
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:33,560
He only fines people.
He never signs.

759
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,850
Ramu…

760
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:42,400
I tried to open the window,
but it was stuck.

761
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:44,680
Can you please help?

762
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:52,300
What did she say?

763
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,010
-Something about the window--
-No…

764
00:48:54,770 --> 00:48:55,650
Before that.

765
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:56,930
Ramu?

766
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:02,400
I never realized
how good my name sounds!

767
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,940
I never knew Ramana could be
shortened as Ramu, sir.

768
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,360
Excuse me!

769
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:11,690
Can I ask you something?

770
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:13,600
You shouldn't mind.

771
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,560
Do you rip your clothes
before putting them on or afterward?

772
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:21,720
It's ripped jeans, Ramu.

773
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:23,640
I guess they are more expensive
than regular jeans.

774
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:24,610
How do you know, sir?

775
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:27,010
I can tell from where
they are ripped and how much they show.

776
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:28,800
They are a different category.

777
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:31,510
Aren't they nice?

778
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:33,470
You look phenomenal.

779
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:38,060
Wow!

780
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:41,430
What did I say about Pani's daughter?

781
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,730
First, you said she's ravishing.

782
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:44,550
Then you said
she's delightfully ravishing.

783
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:45,930
She is not just delightful.

784
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:47,890
She is bloody delightful.

785
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:49,150
I will note that.

786
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:51,650
-Did you put it to dry?
-Yes, I did.

787
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:52,980
Did you eat yet?

788
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:54,390
I wasn't offered.

789
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,770
-Don't be shy in your own house.
-That's right.

790
00:49:56,850 --> 00:49:58,140
Go out and eat.

791
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:05,720
<i>Madam, listen. </i>

792
00:50:05,810 --> 00:50:08,730
<i>You became a minister</i>
<i>to make solid money, </i>

793
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:11,890
<i>not to appoint a Commission</i>
<i>on the double murder</i>

794
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:14,940
<i>that occurred five years ago. </i>
<i>Note that down. </i>

795
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:18,600
<i>You probably think Hari Das is the same</i>
<i>old Das who partnered with your father. </i>

796
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,390
<i>That was a tale of the past. </i>

797
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:25,260
Now, you want to call me,
inquire, and throw me in jail?

798
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,510
The state will be on fire.

799
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,890
<i>You want to call Das and inquire?</i>

800
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:33,110
Will the judge you have appointed
come to your office?

801
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:46,980
Excuse me, ma'am.

802
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:50,300
Mr. Alok has a message for you.

803
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,890
Due to personal reasons, he has
withdrawn from the Hari Das Commission.

804
00:50:58,060 --> 00:50:59,230
Shocking!

805
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:08,190
A judge can be replaced in a week.

806
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,600
A minister can be replaced in ten days.

807
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:16,220
But when Hari Das goes to prison,
it will take him twenty years to get out.

808
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:33,020
Why mess with him?

809
00:51:33,850 --> 00:51:34,890
Listen to me.

810
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:39,190
Even a vile person has some principles,
but he doesn't.

811
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,150
He may not have principles…

812
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,220
but I have responsibilities.

813
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:49,640
-Narayan…
-Tell me?

814
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:53,560
How did Das know that the judge
was going to come here?

815
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:54,930
Why do you say that?

816
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:56,940
We have appointed the Commission.
How would he not know?

817
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:59,150
Not before we could announce.

818
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:00,800
Kata Madhu must have told him.

819
00:52:00,890 --> 00:52:02,640
You can't relax in politics.

820
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:04,180
Get your son ready.

821
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:06,470
If his mother is in power,
he'll be an MP or else an MLA.

822
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:09,940
-Yes…
-Sir?

823
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:11,020
What happened to the signature?

824
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:15,390
-It's not done yet, sir. I--
-You…

825
00:52:33,890 --> 00:52:34,890
Hey, where to?

826
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,260
There's no specific direction.
Just going with the flow.

827
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,430
Wear these glasses.
Let me see if they increase your glamour.

828
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,510
Oh!

829
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:47,800
-Great.
-Thank you, sir.

830
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:48,890
Face sideways.

831
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:52,350
Wow!

832
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:54,610
You look smooth and shiny.

833
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:55,720
I feel embarrassed, sir.

834
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:56,940
So do I.

835
00:52:57,770 --> 00:52:59,440
Turn that way.
Don't change your posture.

836
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:03,690
Coffee.

837
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:10,360
You don't use all that, do you?

838
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:14,110
I don't need it.

839
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,690
You should learn.

840
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:18,230
Besides the clothes…

841
00:53:18,770 --> 00:53:21,190
Those perfumes and creams…

842
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:22,650
Stop moving.

843
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:25,520
Excuse me!

844
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:29,110
Please groom her as well.

845
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:35,690
If you don't mind,
can I say something?

846
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:37,550
Sure.

847
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:40,050
Your eyes are mesmerizing enough.

848
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:43,640
Don't wear eyeliner and kohl.

849
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:45,650
Stupid boys like me fall for you.

850
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:47,480
Don't embarrass me, Ramu.

851
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:50,940
Wow…

852
00:53:51,810 --> 00:53:54,900
Gosh, I never knew
there was so much melody in my name!

853
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:00,810
What's with those sunglasses?

854
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,100
You look like a pickpocket.
Take them off.

855
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:05,480
You said they looked great earlier.

856
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:06,810
She was here earlier.

857
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:13,890
She won't return, I guess.

858
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:23,430
If we ask him now, he would sign
with his blood instead of ink.

859
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:26,190
Let's find the right time and get it.

860
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:27,230
Yes!

861
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:33,470
He started drinking.

862
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:34,520
I can see it.

863
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:36,050
Hi, sir!

864
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:39,150
-Why are you peeking like a thief?
-This is your private time, sir.

865
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:41,020
Oh, wow. Can I join, sir?

866
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:43,020
Is this some school to join?

867
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:44,510
All you need is a glass.

868
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:46,470
Well said, sir.
Thank you.

869
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:52,190
All said and done…

870
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:55,260
Raji's clothes look more appealing on you.

871
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:58,650
You look great.

872
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:01,270
Is it scotch, sir?
I didn't expect this.

873
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:04,470
Only the bottle is foreign.
The drink inside is local.

874
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:07,260
-Little. Just a little.
-Okay.

875
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:09,350
-So, Balu…
-Sir?

876
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:12,680
-That's enough.
-What is your full name?

877
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,480
Bala Subramanyam, sir.

878
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,190
-S. P. B?
-Just B.

879
00:55:17,930 --> 00:55:19,350
You are named after a legend.

880
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:20,390
Thank you, sir.

881
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:22,360
-With his inspiration…
-Sir…

882
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,850
Sing a nice song.

883
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:26,890
I have a problem with my pitch, sir.

884
00:55:26,980 --> 00:55:28,360
Why bring up cricket
in the middle of a song?

885
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:29,720
Not that "pitch. " The tune.

886
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:31,470
This is not the Indian Idol.

887
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:33,100
It's just a warehouse.

888
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:35,390
Forget about making mistakes.
You can try, come on.

889
00:55:35,890 --> 00:55:36,800
Okay, sir.

890
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:39,890
Why are you looking at me like that?

891
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:42,980
Would you like some beer?

892
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:44,690
Sir, you are crossing a line there.

893
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:48,010
Is this some Kabaddi match
to cross lines?

894
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:49,100
She is a kid, sir.

895
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:51,050
They fill the bars these days!

896
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:53,140
Let's not touch on a controversial topic.

897
00:55:53,230 --> 00:55:54,190
Do you have vodka?

898
00:55:54,770 --> 00:55:56,310
Hey…

899
00:55:58,390 --> 00:56:00,890
-Soda or water?
-Juice.

900
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:02,470
Health conscious, I see.

901
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:04,680
-Hey, Yakub.
-Sir.

902
00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:11,260
What is it?

903
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:15,890
I carried her to school in these arms.

904
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:17,930
Take her to the bar
tomorrow onwards.

905
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:19,050
No way.

906
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:21,610
Stop being dramatic and sing a song.

907
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,300
Any specific song, sir?

908
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:26,680
-Any song will do.
-Okay, fine.

909
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,610
Why don't I sing the same song?
To hell with it.

910
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:39,300
<i>I've loved you, and I'll always love you</i>

911
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:46,520
<i>Even after death, I'll keep loving you</i>

912
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:51,480
<i>When I remember you</i>
<i>Then my tears--</i>

913
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:55,810
I was singing a nice song, sir.
Why did you hit me?

914
00:56:55,890 --> 00:56:57,050
Sridevi…

915
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:01,180
I feel like crying when I think of her.

916
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:04,850
May her great soul rest in peace.

917
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:07,190
Sing a song of someone who's alive.

918
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:08,930
Sing a happy song.

919
00:57:09,810 --> 00:57:11,980
Sing something that's
soothing and delightful.

920
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:14,060
Idiot.

921
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:18,180
I'll play it on my phone.

922
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:26,520
<i>-Tell me, oh, cool breeze!</i>
-Wow, what a song!

923
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:30,220
<i>-Embrace me with your chills</i>
-Wow!

924
00:57:31,890 --> 00:57:33,470
How come I hear music with your song?

925
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:34,900
I wasn't singing.
I played it on my phone.

926
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:35,900
Oh.

927
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:37,190
Play it.

928
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:42,400
<i>Tell me, oh, cool breeze</i>
<i>Embrace me with your chills</i>

929
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:47,690
<i>Where the celebration of joy is</i>

930
00:57:47,770 --> 00:57:51,560
<i>Lead me there and tell me</i>

931
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:53,300
Bhumika!

932
00:57:54,810 --> 00:57:57,610
Wow! What a girl!

933
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,930
Wow!

934
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:02,470
What a dancer!

935
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:04,680
He has stopped making them.

936
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,550
They barely have any flesh on them now.

937
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:11,680
Hugging them is like hugging yourself.

938
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:15,110
We don't understand what they say.

939
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:17,390
They don't understand what we say.

940
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:19,440
They don't know how to play or to sway.

941
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:20,900
Don't even get me started
on their language.

942
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:25,470
Baby…

943
00:58:33,020 --> 00:58:33,980
Phone.

944
00:59:07,890 --> 00:59:09,390
She looks like Prabhu Deva's dupe.

945
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:11,800
Are there any bones in her body or not?

946
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:13,970
Forget about her body.
Where is the cigarette, sir?

947
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:21,860
Updated version.

948
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:24,110
-Balu.
-Baby?

949
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:25,720
Go to my library.

950
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:27,970
-Play song fifteen.
-Done.

951
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:42,800
Volume at twenty.

952
00:59:56,020 --> 00:59:56,900
<i>Hey!</i>

953
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:02,600
<i>Hey!</i>

954
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:18,350
<i>Check if it has fallen close by</i>
<i>My gold necklace</i>

955
01:00:18,850 --> 01:00:24,100
<i>Check if it has fallen near you</i>
<i>My gold necklace</i>

956
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:29,860
<i>Check if it has fallen close by</i>
<i>My gold necklace</i>

957
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:35,430
<i>Check if it has fallen near you</i>
<i>My gold necklace</i>

958
01:00:58,600 --> 01:00:59,470
Sorry, sir.

959
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:02,360
Why was my lungi snatched?

960
01:01:02,850 --> 01:01:04,300
Probably, she got too carried away
by the dance, sir.

961
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:05,890
-What dance was that?
-Right, sir.

962
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,350
You have brought Prabhu Deva's dupe.

963
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,680
Whoa!

964
01:01:11,310 --> 01:01:13,060
I couldn't match her energy.

965
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:15,310
I haven't danced like this
in my entire career.

966
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:17,940
My goodness.

967
01:01:19,390 --> 01:01:20,600
Whatever you say…

968
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:23,100
I have enjoyed a lot, man.

969
01:01:23,230 --> 01:01:24,310
Same here, sir.

970
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:26,810
-Life is all about these small moments.
-True, sir.

971
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:33,980
Why are you pulling a pen
out of your blouse?

972
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:37,560
Why are you pulling out a paper
from your pocket?

973
01:01:38,060 --> 01:01:41,900
This small moment calls
for a scribble of your initials, sir.

974
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:43,650
So, you didn't come here
for entertainment?

975
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:48,060
You clearly have an agenda.

976
01:01:49,890 --> 01:01:51,890
-Hold this for me, please.
-Okay.

977
01:01:57,020 --> 01:01:57,940
Slowly.

978
01:01:58,020 --> 01:02:00,060
He was drunk last night
and spared you with a slap.

979
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:03,390
If he sees us when he gets sober,
he will kill us.

980
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:05,470
-Thank God!
-Let's sneak out before he wakes up.

981
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:07,110
-Let's go.
-We won't ever see him again.

982
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:08,640
It should just remain a dream.

983
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:09,770
-The garage is that way.
-Yes.

984
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:12,770
Here's the money.
Is the car ready?

985
01:02:12,850 --> 01:02:14,430
The headlight isn't working.

986
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:15,650
Let it be. Anyway, it is daytime.

987
01:02:15,730 --> 01:02:17,150
The brakes aren't working either.

988
01:02:17,230 --> 01:02:18,650
-We won't use them.
-That's the spirit.

989
01:02:18,730 --> 01:02:19,980
-Keys, sir!
-Give it here!

990
01:02:20,270 --> 01:02:21,400
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

991
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:26,010
No looking back!

992
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:36,350
-What is that?
-Looks like some statue.

993
01:02:36,480 --> 01:02:37,360
Whose?

994
01:02:37,430 --> 01:02:39,600
Who is the scoundrel
that knocked down my father's statue?

995
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:41,400
Who are you?!

996
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:43,100
How dare you?!

997
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:44,890
Satyam killed my father!

998
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:47,060
Now, his guests won't even
spare his statue!

999
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:48,520
Get them!

1000
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:51,400
-Sir, it's a mistake. It was an accident.
-Shut up!

1001
01:02:51,560 --> 01:02:52,900
Tell us if you want money.
Madam can give you.

1002
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:54,060
Who wants your money?

1003
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:55,510
So, what do you expect from us?

1004
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:58,640
You better fix the head of the statue,
or I will replace it with yours!

1005
01:02:58,730 --> 01:03:00,770
-Hey, hurry up! Fast!
-I'm not a great artist, sir!

1006
01:03:00,930 --> 01:03:02,550
-Fix it. Come on!
-Sir! Hey!

1007
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,720
Hey, stop them! Please, sir.

1008
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:06,020
Sir, stop them.

1009
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:08,970
Don't do this, sir. This is wrong.

1010
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:10,980
-We didn't do it on purpose, sir.
-Sir…

1011
01:03:11,060 --> 01:03:12,310
Listen to me, sir.

1012
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:16,640
Madam is in the car. What are you doing?
Listen to me.

1013
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:19,180
-Get her!
-Sir!

1014
01:03:19,770 --> 01:03:20,940
Please ask them to stop, sir.

1015
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:22,230
We offered them money,
and they still won't listen.

1016
01:03:22,310 --> 01:03:23,810
Was his father some Ambedkar or Gandhi?

1017
01:03:27,020 --> 01:03:28,230
My elder brother.

1018
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:32,100
I will pawn my head if need be,
but I will get the statue redone.

1019
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:36,640
Not this head, sir. My head.

1020
01:03:42,810 --> 01:03:45,770
-Why discuss it with her, Uncle? Come!
-Hey, let her go!

1021
01:03:45,850 --> 01:03:47,800
-Hey!
-Hey, catch him!

1022
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:01,690
What was that?

1023
01:04:01,850 --> 01:04:02,800
Who did this?

1024
01:04:02,890 --> 01:04:03,760
Who is that?

1025
01:04:11,850 --> 01:04:13,930
What is this brute force against women?

1026
01:04:14,930 --> 01:04:16,350
-Against women, really?
-Hey!

1027
01:04:17,060 --> 01:04:19,400
Let him go.
They have done something wrong.

1028
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:20,810
As if he has done some engineering!

1029
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:23,180
-An offender shall be punished.
-Let me go.

1030
01:04:23,310 --> 01:04:24,310
Really?

1031
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:28,390
Uncle, please don't act
like Ajay Devgn in <i>Singham. </i>

1032
01:04:28,810 --> 01:04:29,900
It doesn't suit you.

1033
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:32,060
-Limit the issue to the statue.
-Is it so?

1034
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:34,930
-I heard this statue is a jinx.
-Let go of my hand.

1035
01:04:35,140 --> 01:04:37,970
If someone looks at it,
their work seems to go awry.

1036
01:04:38,310 --> 01:04:40,480
-Why don't you tell him, guys?
-He doesn't listen, you know.

1037
01:04:40,560 --> 01:04:42,440
Hey, what are you just watching
and not beating him up?

1038
01:04:42,770 --> 01:04:43,650
Hey!

1039
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:48,510
If anyone steps forward,
I will twist this idiot's arm so much,

1040
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:50,390
-it will get dislodged from the groove.
-Hey…

1041
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:52,900
Let me go.

1042
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:55,110
-I am letting her go. Now, let go of him.
-Let me go.

1043
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:01,360
-Hey, Balu!
-Sir.

1044
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:03,010
-My hand.
-Go and sit in the car first.

1045
01:05:04,390 --> 01:05:05,350
Come.

1046
01:05:23,180 --> 01:05:24,640
-Call me once the car is ready.
-Sure, sir.

1047
01:05:24,730 --> 01:05:25,690
I will let you know.

1048
01:06:02,390 --> 01:06:05,930
<i>The sugar cube in my coffee cup is you</i>
<i>It's you</i>

1049
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:10,150
<i>The tracery of kohl around my eyes is you</i>
<i>It's you</i>

1050
01:06:10,930 --> 01:06:14,430
<i>The blush of chrysanthemum on my cheeks</i>
<i>Is you, it's you</i>

1051
01:06:14,850 --> 01:06:18,470
<i>You wrap around my breath like perfume</i>

1052
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:22,800
<i>Oh, my baby!</i>
<i>I want to pinch your cheeks</i>

1053
01:06:22,890 --> 01:06:26,930
<i>Oh, my baby!</i>
<i>I want to kiss you many times</i>

1054
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:31,980
<i>Oh, my baby!</i>
<i>With my stole, let me make you a tie</i>

1055
01:06:40,230 --> 01:06:44,270
<i>Craving, craving, craving for you</i>
<i>The novel next to my pillow is you</i>

1056
01:06:44,350 --> 01:06:48,220
<i>Tripping, tripping, tripping on you</i>
<i>My new playlist is now just you</i>

1057
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:52,550
<i>Craving, craving, craving for you</i>
<i>The novel next to my pillow is you</i>

1058
01:06:52,770 --> 01:06:56,690
<i>Tripping, tripping, tripping on you</i>
<i>My new playlist is now just you</i>

1059
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:07,970
Hey, Balu.

1060
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:25,760
<i>You are the sun who is my wake-up call</i>
<i>With his warm touch</i>

1061
01:07:25,850 --> 01:07:29,890
<i>You are the full moon</i>
<i>Jumping over my balcony walls</i>

1062
01:07:30,310 --> 01:07:34,110
<i>You are the one among millions</i>
<i>Born only for me</i>

1063
01:07:34,180 --> 01:07:37,930
<i>I became your wife in secret</i>
<i>As soon as I opened my eyes</i>

1064
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:42,110
<i>Oh, my baby!</i>
<i>I want to lie next to you</i>

1065
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:46,260
<i>Oh, my baby!</i>
<i>I want to watch the stars with you</i>

1066
01:07:46,350 --> 01:07:51,260
<i>Oh, my baby!</i>
<i>I want to fill the space in your embrace</i>

1067
01:07:55,350 --> 01:07:59,350
<i>Craving, craving, craving for you</i>
<i>The novel next to my pillow is you</i>

1068
01:07:59,430 --> 01:08:03,640
<i>Tripping, tripping, tripping on you</i>
<i>My new playlist is now just you</i>

1069
01:08:03,730 --> 01:08:07,810
<i>Craving, craving, craving for you</i>
<i>The novel next to my pillow is you</i>

1070
01:08:07,890 --> 01:08:11,260
<i>Tripping, tripping, tripping on you</i>
<i>My new playlist is now just you</i>

1071
01:08:11,350 --> 01:08:13,850
<i>Oh, my baby!</i>

1072
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:18,360
<i>Oh, my baby!</i>

1073
01:08:19,730 --> 01:08:21,150
<i>Oh, my baby!</i>

1074
01:08:23,810 --> 01:08:25,610
<i>Oh, my baby!</i>

1075
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:48,930
Ramana is heading back.

1076
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:50,550
Some other time.

1077
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:53,300
Excuse me!

1078
01:08:55,480 --> 01:08:57,900
Ask your mom to ward off the evil eye.

1079
01:08:59,930 --> 01:09:01,970
You look gorgeous in that dress.

1080
01:09:09,100 --> 01:09:10,390
How come you have become so thin?

1081
01:09:11,100 --> 01:09:13,180
-They don't serve rice in Guntur.
-Really?

1082
01:09:13,350 --> 01:09:14,930
I wonder what they served instead.

1083
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:21,900
Sir, the girl has returned,
and he has left.

1084
01:09:22,350 --> 01:09:23,220
Sir.

1085
01:09:23,730 --> 01:09:24,860
What is this, sir?

1086
01:09:24,930 --> 01:09:26,430
You call yourself a lawyer,
but where is your clarity?

1087
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:29,110
When you say, "The girl has returned, "
do you mean the neighbor or your maid?

1088
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:30,890
"My daughter has returned. "
That's clarity.

1089
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:33,020
Where did she come back from?
From a different city.

1090
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:34,890
Who dropped her off?
Ramana dropped her off.

1091
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:35,900
More clarity.

1092
01:09:35,980 --> 01:09:36,860
Did he come inside?

1093
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:40,560
Since we don't offer any pleasantries,
he took a U-turn and left.

1094
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:41,760
Utmost clarity.

1095
01:09:41,850 --> 01:09:43,640
You know how relieving
this narrative is, sir?

1096
01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:44,860
Who am I talking to?

1097
01:09:44,980 --> 01:09:46,440
-I don't need clarity on that--
-Hey, listen!

1098
01:09:47,020 --> 01:09:48,270
I'm talking to Mr. Venkat Swamy.

1099
01:09:48,390 --> 01:09:49,510
Why am I talking to him?

1100
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:51,140
To get Ramana arrested.

1101
01:09:52,140 --> 01:09:53,680
This is what you call clarity.

1102
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:56,020
Why should he be arrested?
Don't we need clarity on that matter?

1103
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:57,260
You don't need that clarity.

1104
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:58,440
Idiot.

1105
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:23,260
Why are you blocking the road?

1106
01:10:26,230 --> 01:10:27,400
Have you lost your way?

1107
01:10:46,180 --> 01:10:48,300
Bhogineni Veera Venkat Ramana.

1108
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:51,140
What's your full name, chap?

1109
01:10:55,520 --> 01:10:58,020
You can't call me "chap"
just because you can wag your tongue.

1110
01:10:59,230 --> 01:11:00,940
My arm will start acting then.

1111
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:02,940
I don't know which way I might twist it.

1112
01:11:03,310 --> 01:11:04,480
What can you twist?

1113
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:07,980
There's a case against you for picking up
a fight with Mr. Vyra Venkat Swamy.

1114
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:11,520
You mean the brawl
at the party office?

1115
01:11:11,930 --> 01:11:12,800
At home.

1116
01:11:16,430 --> 01:11:18,010
How much did you charge the old man?

1117
01:11:18,430 --> 01:11:19,800
Don't cross the line.

1118
01:11:20,390 --> 01:11:22,260
Is this your first time
at the police station?

1119
01:11:23,060 --> 01:11:25,270
I'm not an employee like you
to come here regularly.

1120
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:30,760
How dare you…

1121
01:11:32,100 --> 01:11:32,970
{\an8}Let go of my hand.

1122
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:35,900
I will flay you, bloody fool!

1123
01:11:36,230 --> 01:11:37,900
Let him remove his uniform.

1124
01:11:38,270 --> 01:11:40,520
I will break this rogue's leg!

1125
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:42,890
What makes you so arrogant?

1126
01:11:43,350 --> 01:11:44,220
Arrogant?

1127
01:11:45,230 --> 01:11:47,270
I don't become arrogant
due to others' strength.

1128
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:48,520
I am like Shah Rukh.

1129
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:49,940
The king!

1130
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:52,640
Let's put you behind bars
for a week and polish you.

1131
01:11:52,770 --> 01:11:53,980
We will know what type you are!

1132
01:11:54,640 --> 01:11:56,930
Am I some brass vessel
that he wants to polish me?

1133
01:11:58,770 --> 01:12:01,560
Some useless idiot
will come with bail for me.

1134
01:12:02,270 --> 01:12:04,900
We will discuss more on polishing
or getting polished.

1135
01:12:05,600 --> 01:12:07,260
-Sir?
-Hey, Balu!

1136
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:10,050
I just said, "Some useless idiot, "
and you walked in! What timing!

1137
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:11,100
I have got you bail, sir.

1138
01:12:11,930 --> 01:12:13,220
-You have got me bail?
-Yes, sir.

1139
01:12:13,310 --> 01:12:14,190
Why?

1140
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:17,440
Actually, sir, during my journey with you…

1141
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:18,400
During your journey?

1142
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:21,930
-Don't say it and kill my feelings.
-Okay, sir.

1143
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:25,860
Your boss files a case, and you
submit bail. Is this your side hustle?

1144
01:12:25,930 --> 01:12:27,550
Look who's talking about side hustle!

1145
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:29,230
Pani filed this case?

1146
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:30,400
Yes, sir.

1147
01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:31,760
What have I done?

1148
01:12:31,850 --> 01:12:32,930
They have written all lies.

1149
01:12:36,930 --> 01:12:38,180
Why don't we make it real?

1150
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:05,900
Well, Pani…

1151
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:07,050
Sir?

1152
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:11,440
Why did your junior choose a losing case
for his first assignment?

1153
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:15,970
Hey, Mr. Spicy Pepper!

1154
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:17,720
Listen.

1155
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:20,940
In a powerful household like ours,

1156
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:23,400
one son is a blessing.

1157
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:25,900
Two is a problem.

1158
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:29,390
If the second one turns out
to be like you, it's disgusting.

1159
01:13:29,480 --> 01:13:31,860
-Sir, actually--
-I'm old. I might forget.

1160
01:13:32,020 --> 01:13:32,900
Let me finish.

1161
01:13:35,140 --> 01:13:39,550
Kids leave their parents
in old age homes these days.

1162
01:13:39,850 --> 01:13:43,220
Why did you drive so far
to meet your mother?

1163
01:13:45,980 --> 01:13:46,980
Get those papers.

1164
01:13:47,730 --> 01:13:48,610
Listen!

1165
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:50,810
The papers are here.

1166
01:13:51,810 --> 01:13:53,270
The case is in the court.

1167
01:13:53,980 --> 01:13:55,310
It's a false case, of course.

1168
01:13:55,390 --> 01:13:58,390
If you choose a fight, prepare a counter
and go to court.

1169
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:01,010
If you choose peace,
sign the papers and go home.

1170
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:04,390
-Balu.
-Sir.

1171
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:11,480
You wrote the FIR, didn't you?

1172
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:14,360
-Yes.
-Read it without spelling mistakes.

Ramana, son of Bhogineni Satyanarayan,

alias Royal Satya, forcefully entered
my house around 10:20 a. m. today.

1182
01:14:51,180 --> 01:14:54,470
He broke my eighty-five-inch, smart TV…

01:14:54,980 --> 01:14:58,060
using the ashtray from the center table.

1184
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:00,440
He smashed it into pieces. "

1185

Hey!

1186
01:15:07,730 --> 01:15:08,980
Hey, what are you doing?

1187
01:15:10,390 --> 01:15:11,260
Hey!

Hey!

Hey!

dining table chair…"

-Stop him!

1193
01:15:29,310 --> 01:15:31,150
and smashed the expensive French window.

1194
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:37,610
He threw the Italian silverware
and food kept for guests

1195
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:40,050
onto the ground
without any discrimination.

1196
01:15:42,680 --> 01:15:45,680
He destroyed the cupboard

the items inside!

1198
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:58,980
He recklessly
beat up the security on duty,

who tried to stop him.

Oh, God!

1208
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:55,220
Where did they raise you?

1209
01:17:56,270 --> 01:17:58,190
In their house
or on the streets of Guntur?

1210
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:03,970
Ask him why he is here.

1211
01:18:04,390 --> 01:18:05,470
What does he want?

1212
01:18:07,270 --> 01:18:08,190
Property?

1213
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:11,720
Talk to Pani and take whatever you want.

1214

If you throw a stone at a tree,
you might get some fruit.

If you throw a stone into a mire,
what will you possibly get?

give me the papers.

1219
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:12,550
Hunger remains unsatisfied
unless the mother herself serves you.

1220
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:13,600
It's a proverb.

1221

Don't forget to read the last line, Pani.

Why?

1228
01:20:03,770 --> 01:20:05,810
Actually, the reason I signed--

1229
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:07,360
You lied for your father.

1230
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:09,430
Why should you tell the truth for me?

1231
01:20:12,430 --> 01:20:14,050
You remembered me in Guntur.

1232
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:16,150
And you sidelined me in the city.

1233
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:18,480
You are justified.

1234
01:20:23,890 --> 01:20:25,300
Why did she ask me who raised me?

1235
01:20:26,730 --> 01:20:27,980
Ideally, she should have raised me.

1236
01:20:29,020 --> 01:20:31,560
But you told me it's a love story
between you and your mom, sir.

1237
01:20:31,640 --> 01:20:32,760
Love, my foot!

1238
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:37,060
The way she glared down
and said, "Clear the trash!"

1239
01:20:37,350 --> 01:20:38,300
Did you see that?

1240
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:42,940
Who do you think the trash was?

1241
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:44,680
It was me, her son.

1242
01:20:46,390 --> 01:20:48,930
Did you think she meant
the broken glass and porcelain?

1243
01:20:52,930 --> 01:20:55,010
My mother, who should have hit me
when I was a kid,

1244
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:59,220
now invites me over
and slaps me in all dignity.

1245
01:21:02,180 --> 01:21:03,300
This chap, Ramana…

1246
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:06,550
His life is a miracle!

1247
01:21:08,140 --> 01:21:10,260
His mother doesn't want him.
His father doesn't remember him.

1248
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:17,140
On the outside, it's fair and lovely.

1249
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:19,510
Deep inside, it's all unfair and lonely.

1250
01:21:31,930 --> 01:21:32,930
Doesn't light up.

1251
01:21:33,890 --> 01:21:35,050
Just like my life.

Bro, he is Kata Madhu.

1254
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:05,140
He says he doesn't get along
with your grandfather.

1255
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:08,520
What does he want?

1256
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:10,430
I heard they slapped
a false case against you,

1257
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:12,810
beat you up, and coerced you to sign.

1258
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:14,550
Are we living in a democracy or a jungle?

1259
01:22:15,390 --> 01:22:17,100
Do they think there's no one
to question them?

1260
01:22:18,390 --> 01:22:20,680
I will make you contest against her.

1261
01:22:20,890 --> 01:22:22,260
I will spend a hundred crores
if necessary.

1262
01:22:22,390 --> 01:22:24,010
I will send you to the Assembly.

1263
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:25,510
All that is fine, boss.

1264
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:27,760
How do you know about this?

1265
01:22:27,890 --> 01:22:31,100
Because their driver is on my payroll.

1266
01:22:31,310 --> 01:22:32,650
-Really?
-Yes.

1267
01:22:34,390 --> 01:22:35,300
Hey, Samba.

1268
01:22:36,680 --> 01:22:38,260
I want to have a heart-to-heart
conversation with him.

1269
01:22:38,430 --> 01:22:39,390
Close the shutter.

1270
01:22:39,480 --> 01:22:41,730
I don't think
I need to teach you the ropes of politics.

1271
01:22:42,640 --> 01:22:44,300
I just wanted to meet my mom…

1272
01:22:45,100 --> 01:22:46,300
not win against her.

1273
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:07,010
Son, please let go of me.
I won't trouble anyone. Forgive me.

1274
01:23:07,310 --> 01:23:08,190
That boy…

1275
01:23:09,020 --> 01:23:13,270
The first emotion I had
when I saw Ramana was pity.

1276
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:17,350
{\an8}I asked him, "I want to make you contest
against your mother. What do you feel?"

1277
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:19,260
He almost hugged me.

1278
01:23:19,430 --> 01:23:21,510
Trust me, I couldn't even breathe!

1279
01:23:21,770 --> 01:23:23,650
{\an8}He made me his guru.

1280
01:23:24,230 --> 01:23:25,690
He was holding my feet.

1281
01:23:25,770 --> 01:23:27,610
I asked him if he had any proof.

1282
01:23:27,770 --> 01:23:29,810
That's it.
He immediately went home

1283
01:23:29,890 --> 01:23:32,720
and got me a family picture
from a treasured box.

1284
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:36,360
Venkat Swamy!

1285
01:23:37,100 --> 01:23:38,430
I have only one thing to say.

1286
01:23:38,980 --> 01:23:41,440
Your grandson or this one?

1287
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:45,150
If you ask us to choose between
Raj Gopal or Venkat Ramana…

1288
01:23:45,230 --> 01:23:47,560
{\an8}<i>we stand with Venkat Ramana. </i>

1289
01:23:48,270 --> 01:23:49,690
<i>You better understand this. </i>

1290
01:23:49,770 --> 01:23:52,810
<i>Otherwise… the public</i>
<i>will make you realize. </i>

1291
01:23:55,980 --> 01:23:59,150
Unlike his dad, he doesn't sit
at home behind closed doors.

1292
01:23:59,270 --> 01:24:01,440
He barges into our house,
breaking open all doors.

1293
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:04,010
Because that is Royal Satyam.

1294
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:05,640
He's an old engine.

1295
01:24:06,020 --> 01:24:09,520
And this is Rowdy Ramana,
a new engine of 1800cc.

1296
01:24:09,730 --> 01:24:10,690
Right, sir.

1297
01:24:10,930 --> 01:24:14,300
If he comes before the public and speaks,
our party won't even get the deposits.

1298
01:24:17,060 --> 01:24:19,400
He is a truck without brakes.

1299
01:24:19,770 --> 01:24:20,900
Who can stop him?

1300
01:24:30,310 --> 01:24:31,650
{\an8}Why are the cops here, sir?

1301
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:33,550
{\an8}Sir…

1302
01:24:33,770 --> 01:24:35,730
{\an8}They are the most prominent family
in this area, sir.

1303
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:38,640
Please approach with caution, sir.

1304
01:24:39,850 --> 01:24:40,800
I mean, with love.

1305
01:24:48,600 --> 01:24:49,550
Ma'am?

1306
01:24:53,270 --> 01:24:55,610
Dussehra is over.
We even gave donations, didn't we?

1307
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:57,680
She's just a kid, sir.
I will make her understand.

1308
01:24:57,770 --> 01:24:59,400
Sir has come from Hyderabad.

1309
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:01,480
It's shocking how people have started
traveling so far for donations!

1310
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:03,470
Hey! Don't you get derisive!

1311
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:05,260
Donations? Again?!

1312
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:07,220
How many times should we give?

1313
01:25:07,310 --> 01:25:08,520
Come back next year. Leave!

1314
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:11,850
Hey, don't infuriate me!
I will lock you all up!

1315
01:25:11,930 --> 01:25:14,140
{\an8}What? For donations?
Sure, try me!

1316
01:25:14,230 --> 01:25:15,650
{\an8}Hey, hold up.
Just wait.

1317
01:25:16,350 --> 01:25:18,350
{\an8}-What is the issue?
-There is no issue.

1318
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,270
{\an8}If Venkat Ramana comes,
we need to go to Hyderabad.

1319
01:25:20,390 --> 01:25:22,260
If you don't know the way,
we can send someone to guide you.

1320
01:25:22,390 --> 01:25:23,550
Why do you want Ramana?

1321
01:25:24,430 --> 01:25:25,350
{\an8}What is this?

1322
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:27,360
{\an8}No one here
gives a straightforward response!

1323
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:29,110
{\an8}Didn't I tell you to think twice, sir?

1324
01:25:34,230 --> 01:25:35,110
Hey, Narayan!

1325
01:25:35,520 --> 01:25:38,360
Why have you come with so many cops?
Were you missing me?

1326
01:25:38,730 --> 01:25:41,860
With the kind of bail you have, you need
my permission before leaving the city.

1327
01:25:41,980 --> 01:25:44,520
{\an8}But you roam as you please.
And why wouldn't I miss you?

1328
01:25:45,270 --> 01:25:46,610
{\an8}We have to report to the station.
Let's go.

1329
01:25:46,770 --> 01:25:47,980
What will you do if I don't?

1330
01:25:48,390 --> 01:25:49,850
{\an8}I'll grab your collar and drag you there!

1331
01:25:49,930 --> 01:25:50,970
You will do no such thing!

1332
01:25:51,430 --> 01:25:53,850
-Run for your life!
-Grab him!

1333
01:25:59,180 --> 01:26:00,260
Hey!

1334
01:26:00,350 --> 01:26:02,350
-What is he saying?
-What should we do with him?

1335
01:26:02,730 --> 01:26:03,770
He is a cop.

1336
01:26:04,060 --> 01:26:05,110
Are you going to crush him?

1337
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:07,400
Let go of him. Leave him.

1338
01:26:08,980 --> 01:26:09,900
Mohammed.

1339
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:11,970
Mohammed!

1340
01:26:12,060 --> 01:26:13,400
Sir, over here!

1341
01:26:13,770 --> 01:26:16,360
I have been telling you
to handle it with care!

1342
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,970
-Hey, Samba.
-Yes?

1343
01:26:19,770 --> 01:26:20,770
What is the gentleman saying?

1344
01:26:20,850 --> 01:26:22,220
He says he will kill us if we let him go.

1345
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:23,690
Bravo!

1346
01:26:25,560 --> 01:26:26,480
Narayan…

1347
01:26:28,060 --> 01:26:29,520
Venkat Swamy had called you, right?

1348
01:26:30,810 --> 01:26:32,060
{\an8}He asked you to pick me up, right?

1349
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:34,770
Go, tell the old man.

1350
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:37,800
Ramana's collar is not starched.

1351
01:26:38,810 --> 01:26:41,150
It is stiff with arrogance.

1352
01:26:41,810 --> 01:26:44,110
Tell him if he touches it,
he will burn himself.

1353
01:26:47,770 --> 01:26:49,230
Gun? My gun!

1354
01:26:49,890 --> 01:26:51,600
What will you do with the CI's gun?

1355
01:26:52,100 --> 01:26:53,180
You want to play with it?

1356
01:26:53,560 --> 01:26:54,440
Give it back.

1357
01:26:55,730 --> 01:26:56,650
You…

1358
01:26:58,140 --> 01:26:59,010
Sir.

1359
01:27:03,930 --> 01:27:06,100
-Why did you take a picture?
-In case I need it…

1360
01:27:06,180 --> 01:27:07,180
To garland?

1361
01:27:09,430 --> 01:27:10,350
Hey!

1362
01:27:11,350 --> 01:27:13,050
Escort the CI to his Jeep.

1363
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:15,650
-Come on, let's go!
-Come on!

1364
01:27:15,770 --> 01:27:16,650
Ramana.

1365
01:27:27,020 --> 01:27:27,900
What is the matter?

1366
01:27:28,890 --> 01:27:29,850
Why were the police here?

1367
01:27:29,930 --> 01:27:32,180
Your son went
to Minister Vasundhara's house.

1368
01:27:32,350 --> 01:27:33,550
He beat up their people.

1369
01:27:33,890 --> 01:27:35,550
{\an8}He damaged their furniture.

1370
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:37,350
{\an8}We came to question him,
and he's threatening us!

1371
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:39,230
{\an8}I'm telling you,
I will not spare him!

1372
01:27:39,310 --> 01:27:40,190
It's a warning!

1373
01:27:40,600 --> 01:27:41,640
Hey, no!

1374
01:27:42,060 --> 01:27:44,150
Move aside!
We will take care of it later!

1375
01:27:44,230 --> 01:27:45,690
Hey, move! Give way!

1376
01:27:48,230 --> 01:27:49,310
Are you a rowdy?

1377
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:52,050
-Or some goon?
-Wow!

1378
01:27:54,270 --> 01:27:56,690
Mr. Satya has finally opened his mouth
and chided me.

1379
01:27:58,140 --> 01:27:59,300
It's going to rain today.

1380
01:27:59,390 --> 01:28:00,850
He only smashed things.

1381
01:28:00,930 --> 01:28:03,140
I would have burnt the place down.

1382
01:28:03,230 --> 01:28:05,480
You say enough things
to instigate him.

1383
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:07,550
Hey!

1384
01:28:08,020 --> 01:28:09,940
If you have to sign, just go and sign.

1385
01:28:10,270 --> 01:28:11,480
Why did you have to fight?

1386
01:28:11,810 --> 01:28:13,270
They filed a case against me.

1387
01:28:13,770 --> 01:28:14,770
Do you expect me to honor them?

1388
01:28:15,730 --> 01:28:17,730
Should I sit gazing out of the window,
just like you?

1389
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:21,050
To believe he's searching for his wife…
Hyderabad is not that way.

1390
01:28:21,230 --> 01:28:22,150
It's this way.

1391
01:28:22,390 --> 01:28:24,010
No one knows what he keeps looking at.

1392
01:28:25,430 --> 01:28:27,220
I did what was written in the complaint.

1393
01:28:27,310 --> 01:28:30,310
Has he killed anyone
that you're interrogating him?

1394
01:28:30,390 --> 01:28:31,260
Bujji!

1395
01:28:33,640 --> 01:28:34,510
Hey…

1396
01:28:35,560 --> 01:28:37,360
Do you even know why she left me?

1397
01:28:39,270 --> 01:28:40,190
For you.

1398
01:28:41,980 --> 01:28:43,400
<i>After the blast at the warehouse…</i>

1399
01:28:45,770 --> 01:28:48,270
<i>I wanted to get your uncle out of jail. </i>

1400
01:28:50,020 --> 01:28:52,770
<i>And she wanted to take you to the hospital</i>
<i>for your eye. </i>

1401
01:28:54,100 --> 01:28:56,010
<i>We had a fight over our priorities. </i>

1402
01:28:57,430 --> 01:28:59,550
<i>I was young and arrogant. </i>

1403
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:00,890
<i>I scolded your mother. </i>

1404
01:29:01,180 --> 01:29:04,050
<i>I mentioned that I knew</i>
<i>when to get my son treated. </i>

1405
01:29:04,140 --> 01:29:05,100
Satya!

1406
01:29:10,810 --> 01:29:12,610
When she wanted to take you and leave…

1407
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:17,100
in my state of confusion,
I requested the door to be closed.

1408
01:29:17,810 --> 01:29:20,190
Your aunt never disobeys her brother.

1409
01:29:21,430 --> 01:29:22,760
She shut the door on your mother.

1410
01:29:31,730 --> 01:29:34,860
That broke your mother's heart,
and she left.

1411
01:29:36,310 --> 01:29:37,610
Even at the court,

1412
01:29:38,390 --> 01:29:39,930
she asked your aunt about you.

1413
01:29:41,980 --> 01:29:42,940
Bujji…

1414
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:45,360
please tell me his eye is fine.

1415
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:50,050
They say it won't go back to normal.

1416
01:29:50,640 --> 01:29:52,430
They said it should have been
treated immediately.

1417
01:29:55,310 --> 01:29:57,190
<i>Enraged that you had lost your eye, </i>

1418
01:29:57,640 --> 01:30:01,260
<i>though your uncle was the one who</i>
<i>stabbed, she directed her finger at me. </i>

1419
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:03,140
<i>Since his daughter had returned to him, </i>

1420
01:30:03,730 --> 01:30:05,690
<i>your grandfather didn't say</i>
<i>I was innocent. </i>

1421
01:30:06,390 --> 01:30:09,680
<i>Marx's elder brother was dead, </i>
<i>and his enemy was convicted. </i>

1422
01:30:09,770 --> 01:30:11,190
<i>So, Marx remained silent. </i>

1423
01:30:11,270 --> 01:30:12,150
JUNIOR CIVIL JUDGE JUDICIAL MAGISTRATE
FIRST CLASS COURT GUNTUR

1424
01:30:12,930 --> 01:30:14,350
<i>I was behind bars for ten years. </i>

1425
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:16,640
<i>So, I couldn't meet her. </i>

1426
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:19,770
During the ten years I spent in prison…

1427
01:30:20,850 --> 01:30:23,010
there was nobody here
to close the doors on her.

1428
01:30:24,180 --> 01:30:25,260
And yet, she didn't return.

1429
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:27,310
Why didn't she take you back?

1430
01:30:28,310 --> 01:30:29,440
Isn't that what you should be asking?

1431
01:30:30,310 --> 01:30:31,860
Why do you get into a brawl instead?

1432
01:30:32,770 --> 01:30:35,110
I can't come up with a solution
to my problem.

1433
01:30:35,350 --> 01:30:38,010
That's why I keep staring
out of the window.

1434
01:30:39,480 --> 01:30:42,400
You, on the other hand,
don't even know what the problem is!

1435
01:30:42,890 --> 01:30:45,260
That's why, instead of talking,
you're trying to become like me.

1436
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:48,020
I'm afraid that…

1437
01:30:48,520 --> 01:30:49,900
in just another four years…

1438
01:30:50,310 --> 01:30:52,020
you might sit next to me
in front of the window.

1439
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:57,550
Ramana…

1440
01:30:59,100 --> 01:31:01,550
I know why my wife left me.

1441
01:31:02,680 --> 01:31:03,600
But…

1442
01:31:04,430 --> 01:31:06,850
Do you know
why your mother left you?

1443
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:17,350
It's not that. Mr. Satya…

1444
01:31:18,430 --> 01:31:19,850
Hello! Mr. Satya!

1445
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:23,860
She is the one who left me.
What should I do?

1446
01:31:26,430 --> 01:31:28,510
If I replace the broken furniture…

1447
01:31:29,390 --> 01:31:32,390
and ask her,
"Mom, why did you leave me? Tell me, "

1448
01:31:32,560 --> 01:31:33,610
will she tell me?

1449
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:36,600
Or will she hold my hand and come back?

1450
01:31:38,480 --> 01:31:39,610
Can you guarantee that?

1451
01:31:40,980 --> 01:31:42,610
There he goes with his songs.

1452
01:31:46,350 --> 01:31:47,890
She scolds, and he laments.

1453
01:31:49,020 --> 01:31:50,400
They don't even give us
a chance to cry.

1454
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:53,140
But both have dragged me to the curb.

1455
01:31:56,270 --> 01:31:58,310
I have found a great caption for my life.

1456
01:32:00,180 --> 01:32:01,390
"A father staring out of the window.

1457
01:32:02,930 --> 01:32:04,430
A mother shutting the door.

1458
01:32:04,730 --> 01:32:06,690
As for me…
A son out and about the streets. "

1459
01:32:08,180 --> 01:32:09,680
Why are you holding a spoon?

1460
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:12,770
I am a goon,
that's why she didn't want me.

1461
01:32:13,100 --> 01:32:13,970
Let it be.

1462
01:32:14,060 --> 01:32:16,150
Why should I go and ask her again?

1463
01:32:17,730 --> 01:32:20,270
Every flirt seems to be getting lucky.

1464
01:32:20,810 --> 01:32:22,560
Not a single sad song is trending!

1465
01:32:22,640 --> 01:32:24,550
Yeah, you want others to cry for you.

1466
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:27,470
-Let's go for this one.
-Have you found one finally?

1467
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:29,930
A little on the side.

1468
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:32,140
-Is this okay?
-Yes. Perfect.

1469
01:32:33,680 --> 01:32:35,300
Three, two, one!

1470
01:32:37,480 --> 01:32:44,440
<i>Your love's eyes caress you</i>
<i>And yet, why do you stay unmoved?</i>

1471
01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:52,100
<i>I cast a net and wait patiently</i>
<i>But is this all in vain?</i>

1472
01:32:54,140 --> 01:32:55,470
She has made a
reel on Instagram.

1473
01:32:55,850 --> 01:32:57,010
I guess it's for you.

1474
01:33:03,850 --> 01:33:10,510
{\an8}<i>My darling friend, my heart throb</i>
<i>Look at me once, please</i>

1475
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:17,350
Must be for the video likes.

1476
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:20,060
Not because she likes me.

1477
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:25,470
<i>Sister, your dress is really nice. </i>
<i>Where did you buy it from?</i>

1478
01:33:26,270 --> 01:33:27,730
Come and take it when I die.

1479
01:33:28,230 --> 01:33:29,900
-Why don't you tell the poor thing?
-Shut up!

1480
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:32,890
<i>Someone who ignores a beautiful girl</i>
<i>like you has to be a fool. </i>

1481
01:33:32,980 --> 01:33:34,020
<i>You can always count on me. </i>

1482
01:33:34,180 --> 01:33:35,050
<i>Chill. </i>

1483
01:33:35,520 --> 01:33:37,230
He seems to have a lot of free time.

1484
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:41,520
<i>Visit Shirdi once, dear. </i>
<i>Everything will fall into place. </i>

1485
01:33:48,810 --> 01:33:52,110
When the CI went to meet him yesterday,
he snatched his gun and threatened him.

1486
01:33:52,230 --> 01:33:54,270
Clashes with the cops
and meetings with Madhu.

1487
01:33:54,680 --> 01:33:56,800
He is purposely creating a nuisance
out of sheer vengeance.

1488
01:33:56,890 --> 01:33:58,970
I don't want to talk about the past.

1489
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:01,310
What did your son take
in exchange for that photo?

1490
01:34:01,390 --> 01:34:03,890
Whatever he had taken from you
for signing the papers.

1491
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:07,110
Talk to him once.

1492
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:09,930
Ask him to keep quiet,
at least until the elections conclude.

1493
01:34:28,180 --> 01:34:30,180
Why have they brought
Mr. Satya's gramophone here?

1494
01:34:33,980 --> 01:34:35,270
Play the rhythm.
Let me show you.

1495
01:35:02,850 --> 01:35:06,300
<i>Bro, it doesn't matter how big the bill is</i>

1496
01:35:06,560 --> 01:35:09,610
<i>I'm feeling low and I will have a full</i>

1497
01:35:10,310 --> 01:35:13,770
<i>A thorn pierced through my heart</i>

1498
01:35:14,060 --> 01:35:17,520
<i>My pain has worsened</i>

1499
01:35:17,730 --> 01:35:21,310
<i>The world has changed</i>
<i>The evil has united</i>

1500
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:25,230
<i>For a sensitive man like me</i>
<i>Every day is a rotting hell</i>

1501
01:35:25,310 --> 01:35:28,860
<i>No one to blame</i>
<i>I'm angry with myself</i>

1502
01:35:29,100 --> 01:35:32,930
<i>When the sky remains unreachable</i>
<i>How long can we leap?</i>

1503
01:35:34,140 --> 01:35:37,930
<i>Hey, people think they have people</i>
<i>But no one actually belongs</i>

1504
01:35:38,020 --> 01:35:41,520
<i>All relations, and endearments</i>
<i>Are just part of lip service</i>

1505
01:35:41,730 --> 01:35:45,360
<i>Hey, vexed eyes are dry of tears</i>

1506
01:35:45,770 --> 01:35:49,480
<i>I look around and find that</i>
<i>I am my only lover</i>

1507
01:36:26,180 --> 01:36:27,220
<i>Brother!</i>

1508
01:36:27,430 --> 01:36:29,430
<i>Spicy and pungent!</i>

1509
01:36:31,180 --> 01:36:33,140
<i>Stinging chili powder!</i>

1510
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:38,270
Sir…

1511
01:36:40,560 --> 01:36:43,980
Sir!
A contract has been issued to kill you.

1512
01:36:44,060 --> 01:36:45,310
Ammu sent me here.

1513
01:36:45,890 --> 01:36:51,100
<i>Iron bar, heavy hammer</i>
<i>A single blow and broken by sparks!</i>

1514
01:36:52,770 --> 01:36:53,650
{\an8}Hey!

1515
01:36:55,430 --> 01:36:56,600
{\an8}Is there a Ramana here?

1516
01:36:59,560 --> 01:37:00,520
One second.

1517
01:37:00,930 --> 01:37:01,800
Hello…

1518
01:37:02,930 --> 01:37:04,430
I see you are with a red light.

1519
01:37:05,020 --> 01:37:06,360
Are you taking us to the area?

1520
01:37:13,810 --> 01:37:14,770
Got you!

1521
01:37:40,350 --> 01:37:41,850
{\an8}Hey, come out.
Get down.

1522
01:37:46,930 --> 01:37:50,140
Brother, when we asked for Ramana,
two of them had come forward.

1523
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:51,940
We brought them both as a precaution.

1524
01:37:52,140 --> 01:37:53,300
Hey, Amazon!

1525
01:37:53,810 --> 01:37:55,690
Stop the chatter and open the parcel.

1526
01:37:59,180 --> 01:38:00,220
Hey, get down!

1527
01:38:00,600 --> 01:38:01,680
Hey, get down!

1528
01:38:05,770 --> 01:38:06,770
Sir!

1529
01:38:07,390 --> 01:38:08,720
-Can't you hear me?
-Sir!

1530
01:38:09,020 --> 01:38:10,060
Please get up!

1531
01:38:35,560 --> 01:38:36,440
Sir…

1532
01:38:37,350 --> 01:38:38,510
-Sir…
-Hey, Samba!

1533
01:38:39,430 --> 01:38:40,600
I don't think Samba is around, sir.

1534
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:43,180
-Samba!
-Sir! Balu, sir.

1535
01:38:44,060 --> 01:38:45,360
Sir, it's Balu.

1536
01:38:48,100 --> 01:38:49,100
What are you doing here?

1537
01:38:50,060 --> 01:38:51,190
Ammu has sent me.

1538
01:38:51,310 --> 01:38:52,480
-Ammu?
-Yes.

1539
01:38:53,980 --> 01:38:54,980
Why did she send you?

1540
01:38:55,060 --> 01:38:57,270
Some Babji has been given a contract
to kill you, sir.

1541
01:38:57,350 --> 01:38:59,350
I tried to inform you,
but you got me drunk.

1542
01:38:59,980 --> 01:39:00,860
By who?

1543
01:39:13,100 --> 01:39:14,300
Who are all these people?

1544
01:39:15,430 --> 01:39:17,680
Are we appointing new drivers
for our trucks?

1545
01:39:18,100 --> 01:39:19,470
They are the contract holders, sir.

1546
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:20,560
-Contract?
-Yes.

1547
01:39:20,770 --> 01:39:21,650
For what?

1548
01:39:22,020 --> 01:39:23,940
{\an8}Ammu has sent me
to tell you exactly that, sir.

1549
01:39:24,020 --> 01:39:24,900
{\an8}Hey!

1550
01:39:24,980 --> 01:39:27,310
{\an8}We are not on talking terms.
Why would she send you?

1551
01:39:27,390 --> 01:39:29,470
{\an8}Spare me your personal issues, sir!

1552
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:31,690
{\an8}Babji has been paid to kill you!

1553
01:39:31,770 --> 01:39:33,650
{\an8}I wanted to tell you the same,
but you got me drunk!

1554
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:35,440
{\an8}By who?

1555
01:39:37,100 --> 01:39:38,510
It was you, sir!

1556
01:39:43,430 --> 01:39:44,300
For what?

1557
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:48,770
Oh, Go! I curse my fate! Kill me!

1558
01:39:48,850 --> 01:39:49,720
{\an8}Hey!

1559
01:39:51,100 --> 01:39:52,800
{\an8}He has swallowed a mic.

1560
01:39:52,930 --> 01:39:54,220
{\an8}Idiot.

1561
01:39:58,980 --> 01:39:59,900
Hey…

1562
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:01,860
are you here to give him a haircut?

1563
01:40:02,390 --> 01:40:04,600
I don't want his hair.
I want his head! Get it!

1564
01:41:20,390 --> 01:41:21,300
What happened?

1565
01:41:21,770 --> 01:41:22,690
He is sleeping.

1566
01:41:23,180 --> 01:41:24,470
So, should I turn on the AC?

1567
01:41:24,600 --> 01:41:25,890
Wake him up, you fool!

1568
01:41:26,890 --> 01:41:27,930
{\an8}Hey, get up!

1569
01:41:28,480 --> 01:41:34,400
{\an8}<i>Wake up, wake up!</i>
<i>Oh, my king!</i>

1570
01:41:47,270 --> 01:41:48,940
Who took the contract to kill me?

1571
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:50,360
Hey, half-bottle!

1572
01:41:51,430 --> 01:41:53,760
I'm the contract killer
tasked with ending your life.

1573
01:41:54,140 --> 01:41:55,470
I am Babji.

1574
01:41:56,680 --> 01:41:58,010
Gelatin Babji.

1575
01:41:59,060 --> 01:42:00,900
You are very costly.

1576
01:42:02,060 --> 01:42:03,770
I took one crore rupees.

1577
01:42:04,730 --> 01:42:06,270
Remember this before you die.

1578
01:42:06,390 --> 01:42:08,100
Why would Ammu give you one crore rupees?

1579
01:42:09,810 --> 01:42:10,770
Hey!

1580
01:42:11,770 --> 01:42:13,520
Is there a queue system now?

1581
01:42:13,930 --> 01:42:14,800
Move!

1582
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:01,020
How audacious of you
to put a price tag on me!

1583
01:43:02,310 --> 01:43:03,310
My name is Ramana.

1584
01:43:04,270 --> 01:43:05,520
I'm not for sale.

1585
01:43:05,890 --> 01:43:07,140
-Hey, Balu.
-Sir?

1586
01:43:07,480 --> 01:43:08,400
Who are all these men?

1587
01:43:08,640 --> 01:43:09,890
{\an8}Why did Ammu send them?

1588
01:43:10,140 --> 01:43:12,390
{\an8}Why would Ammu send them, sir?
Do you think she is crazy?

1589
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:13,690
Ammu has sent me!

1590
01:43:14,310 --> 01:43:17,480
You're the one bothering me
by constantly chanting Ammu's name, sir!

1591
01:43:18,140 --> 01:43:19,350
It was Babji who took the contract.

1592
01:43:19,930 --> 01:43:22,600
It's Vyra Venkat Swamy who
wants you dead! Your grandfather!

1593
01:43:24,980 --> 01:43:27,150
-Who?
-Your bloody old grandfather.

1594
01:43:27,600 --> 01:43:28,760
-My grandfather?
-Yes!

1595
01:43:29,100 --> 01:43:30,720
Hey, what is this meeting about?

1596
01:43:30,850 --> 01:43:31,720
Keep quiet!

1597
01:43:33,520 --> 01:43:35,020
Why does the old man want to kill me?

1598
01:43:35,100 --> 01:43:35,970
Oh, God!

1599
01:43:36,430 --> 01:43:38,600
Hey! I'm a saint with no enemies.

1600
01:43:39,350 --> 01:43:40,470
A saint?

1601
01:43:41,850 --> 01:43:43,930
Sir! Do you even know its meaning?

1602
01:43:44,230 --> 01:43:46,150
Great souls like Yudhishthira and Vidura--

1603
01:43:46,230 --> 01:43:47,980
-Hey, shut up!
-Shut up, man!

1604
01:43:50,230 --> 01:43:51,650
Whenever you meet them, you threaten them.

1605
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:53,650
Why won't they kill you?

1606
01:43:53,810 --> 01:43:54,940
You think they will pamper you?

1607
01:43:58,730 --> 01:43:59,610
{\an8}Hey!

1608
01:43:59,680 --> 01:44:00,930
{\an8}Hey, stop!

1609
01:44:01,020 --> 01:44:01,980
Hey!

1610
01:44:02,430 --> 01:44:04,180
-Hey!
-You might hit us.

1611
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:10,440
Hey!

1612
01:44:11,140 --> 01:44:12,180
Are you gone?

1613
01:44:29,850 --> 01:44:31,760
-How many fingers are these?
-Whose fingers?

1614
01:44:34,270 --> 01:44:35,360
Mine's only one.

1615
01:44:36,730 --> 01:44:38,310
I guess he has lost both his eyes.

1616
01:44:38,390 --> 01:44:40,100
-Is he blind?
-You doubt it?

1617
01:44:40,180 --> 01:44:41,390
Blind? Who is blind?

1618
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:43,900
-Who is that?
-You! Idiot!

1619
01:44:44,270 --> 01:44:46,480
You said your name was some Tin or Can.
What was it?

1620
01:44:47,930 --> 01:44:49,300
Gelatin Babji, brother.

1621
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:50,400
Christian?

1622
01:44:50,850 --> 01:44:52,390
No, brother. Hindu.

1623
01:44:52,730 --> 01:44:53,690
What is Gelatin?

1624
01:44:54,350 --> 01:44:55,930
That's my profession, brother.

1625
01:44:56,310 --> 01:44:58,730
I use gelatin sticks
and blast rocks in quarries.

1626
01:44:58,890 --> 01:45:00,640
Are the sticks this long?

1627
01:45:00,980 --> 01:45:01,900
No.

1628
01:45:02,140 --> 01:45:03,100
They are only this long.

1629
01:45:08,100 --> 01:45:09,050
Hey!

1630
01:45:09,350 --> 01:45:10,430
Where is my grandpa right now?

1631
01:45:11,100 --> 01:45:13,430
How would I know
where your grandfather is, brother?

1632
01:45:15,270 --> 01:45:16,940
Tell me.
Where is the old man?

1633
01:45:17,770 --> 01:45:18,940
-Surya!
-Brother!

1634
01:45:19,850 --> 01:45:21,180
Send him the location.

1635
01:45:38,480 --> 01:45:40,690
What's up, Venkat Swamy?
Is the scenery so good?

1636
01:45:40,890 --> 01:45:41,890
You seem engrossed!

1637
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:43,730
Why are you here?

1638
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:45,520
What do you want from me?

1639
01:45:46,060 --> 01:45:48,810
I'm done with you.
So why did you still send goons at me?

1640
01:45:48,890 --> 01:45:50,010
I sent goons?!

1641
01:45:50,640 --> 01:45:52,640
Hey, what is
he talking about, Narayan?

1642
01:45:54,140 --> 01:45:55,100
Mr. Narayan!

1643
01:45:55,730 --> 01:45:58,480
Sir! Mr. Narayan! Sorry, sir.
The job is not done.

1644
01:45:59,350 --> 01:46:00,930
Uncle, was it you who sent them?

1645
01:46:01,680 --> 01:46:03,760
Who asked you to get him killed?

1646
01:46:03,850 --> 01:46:06,010
Didn't you tell me
he shouldn't open his mouth?

1647
01:46:06,180 --> 01:46:07,600
-I did?
-Yes.

1648
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:11,260
People like him will only be quiet
when they die. There is no other option.

1649
01:46:12,100 --> 01:46:13,550
-Hey, Babji!
-Brother?

1650
01:46:13,640 --> 01:46:16,010
Pass the phone. Let's play them
the sound of Ramana's voice.

1651
01:46:16,180 --> 01:46:17,100
Here, brother.

1652
01:46:17,270 --> 01:46:18,560
-Hey, I'm here.
-It's okay, brother.

1653
01:46:18,640 --> 01:46:19,600
Hey!

1654
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:21,690
Who are you calling?

1655
01:46:22,140 --> 01:46:23,140
Hey, close them.

1656
01:46:38,930 --> 01:46:41,850
Before coming here, we loaded the cars
and set the trigger on the phone.

1657
01:46:41,930 --> 01:46:44,350
The explosion and cars soaring
amidst the dust were an added bonus.

1658
01:46:44,480 --> 01:46:48,480
Madhu and you want to trample on
my daughter's and my political careers?

1659
01:46:48,680 --> 01:46:50,720
Why will I join hands
with that pickpocket?

1660
01:46:51,350 --> 01:46:53,430
He came to me, and I thrashed him.

1661
01:46:53,680 --> 01:46:55,350
He snatched my wallet in the flow.

1662
01:46:56,850 --> 01:46:58,430
You owe me the five thousand rupees
that I lost.

1663
01:46:59,390 --> 01:47:00,390
Look, Venkat Swamy!

1664
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:02,650
The next time I come, cars won't fly.

1665
01:47:02,850 --> 01:47:04,470
You will fly along with your building!

1666
01:47:06,060 --> 01:47:07,810
-Hey, come on.
-Take me along, brother.

1667
01:47:08,390 --> 01:47:11,470
Why do you water those?
Water the dried-up plants.

1668
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:20,720
He is not home.

1669
01:47:21,020 --> 01:47:21,940
Is that the girl?

1670
01:47:22,020 --> 01:47:22,900
That's the mother.

1671
01:47:22,980 --> 01:47:24,190
Come in and sit.

1672
01:47:27,140 --> 01:47:28,850
-Is she the one?
-Her younger sister.

1673
01:47:28,930 --> 01:47:30,720
Someone loves tea.

1674
01:47:31,060 --> 01:47:32,940
Ask them if they want some, Balu.

1675
01:47:33,020 --> 01:47:35,190
-Is that the mother?
-It's the father with a sore throat!

1676
01:47:35,850 --> 01:47:37,350
-Give it.
-Sir.

1677
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:46,260
Do you think we should say thanks?

1678
01:47:46,480 --> 01:47:48,770
-Someone seems to be expecting it.
-Drat!

1679
01:47:48,980 --> 01:47:51,520
When I heard you were safe,
I wore a sari to go to the temple.

1680
01:47:51,850 --> 01:47:53,600
If I weren't safe,
would you be wearing pants?

1681
01:47:58,140 --> 01:47:59,970
When will you understand my heart, sir?

1682
01:48:00,230 --> 01:48:02,770
You play cricket
and football with my heart…

1683
01:48:03,140 --> 01:48:04,850
but I'm supposed to understand!

1684
01:48:05,850 --> 01:48:07,600
Why am I being tortured, Balu?

1685
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:08,680
No idea, baby.

1686
01:48:08,850 --> 01:48:10,050
Why do you want to involve him?

1687
01:48:10,890 --> 01:48:11,890
Idiot!

1688
01:48:12,060 --> 01:48:14,360
-What did I do, sir?
-You did nothing.

1689
01:48:14,810 --> 01:48:16,020
You are a serpent.

1690
01:48:16,980 --> 01:48:19,150
Did you ever let us sit
next to each other?

1691
01:48:19,390 --> 01:48:21,180
You would pull her away,
calling her "baby" all the time.

1692
01:48:21,270 --> 01:48:22,150
Idiot!

1693
01:48:24,270 --> 01:48:26,270
Is sitting next to you enough,
or shall I sit in your lap?

1694
01:48:31,930 --> 01:48:33,800
I took her to school with these hands.

1695
01:48:33,890 --> 01:48:34,850
What happened, Balu?

1696
01:48:35,020 --> 01:48:37,310
She apologizes to him,
and he expresses his gratitude.

1697
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:39,550
What's the color of her skin?

1698
01:48:40,230 --> 01:48:41,940
She must be all red from blushing.

1699
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:44,100
Eleven, twelve, thirteen.

1700
01:48:44,980 --> 01:48:46,770
Twelve, thirteen, fourteen…

1701
01:48:47,350 --> 01:48:48,680
Hey, what are you doing?

1702
01:48:49,930 --> 01:48:51,140
Why did you go to him?

1703
01:48:51,600 --> 01:48:54,010
She asked me to warn Ramana.

1704
01:48:54,180 --> 01:48:55,930
-This one?
-Who else? This one?

1705
01:48:57,230 --> 01:48:58,110
Hey!

1706
01:48:59,560 --> 01:49:02,360
I had asked you to get his signature.
Instead, you have been spying on me!

1707
01:49:04,350 --> 01:49:06,260
What makes you so captivated by him?

1708
01:49:07,390 --> 01:49:10,100
His own mother rejected him
and abandoned him.

1709
01:49:13,140 --> 01:49:14,550
I'm sure she didn't take a proper look.

1710
01:49:14,640 --> 01:49:16,470
And I believe
he didn't step into the house?

1711
01:49:17,140 --> 01:49:18,220
I stepped out myself.

1712
01:49:19,770 --> 01:49:22,270
He was ready to pick a fight.
Your mom told me.

1713
01:49:22,350 --> 01:49:23,640
That's his way of showing love.

1714
01:49:24,680 --> 01:49:26,260
You don't seem to understand my situation.

1715
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:29,020
Continue this, and I will hang myself.
Be warned!

1716
01:49:30,930 --> 01:49:31,850
Balu…

1717
01:49:34,310 --> 01:49:35,230
What is this?

1718
01:49:35,480 --> 01:49:38,020
Are you threatening me that
you'll kill yourself? Go ahead!

1719
01:49:38,100 --> 01:49:39,470
No, that is meant for you.

1720
01:49:40,890 --> 01:49:44,550
If you can't kick the stool, there are
four of us here. One of us will do it.

1721
01:49:47,350 --> 01:49:48,300
Hey, silly girl!

1722
01:49:48,390 --> 01:49:51,850
Most Honorable Venkat Swamy
takes care of our needs.

1723
01:49:53,310 --> 01:49:56,150
But I am in love with Venkat Ramana.

1724
01:50:05,480 --> 01:50:08,270
He visits Hyderabad frequently.
I wonder what's so interesting!

1725
01:50:08,350 --> 01:50:10,260
His mother probably
comes into his dreams every day.

1726
01:50:10,520 --> 01:50:12,480
The father and son
appear deeply engrossed.

1727
01:50:13,020 --> 01:50:14,690
Hey, bring me that cloth!

1728
01:50:15,350 --> 01:50:17,760
Just the other day, they filed a case
and forced him to sign.

1729
01:50:17,850 --> 01:50:19,180
Moreover,

1730
01:50:19,390 --> 01:50:21,100
unsatisfied, they sent thugs after him.

1731
01:50:21,430 --> 01:50:24,510
Your dad wants you to find out
why a woman like her left you.

1732
01:50:24,600 --> 01:50:26,010
Go and ask her!

1733
01:50:26,310 --> 01:50:27,940
You don't pay attention
to the people around you.

1734
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:29,440
Hey!

1735
01:50:32,060 --> 01:50:33,610
You have been badgering me for hours!

1736
01:50:34,060 --> 01:50:36,310
You closed the door on my mother,
and she left.

1737
01:50:37,390 --> 01:50:38,430
It's all your fault.

1738
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:41,560
You are afraid
I would keep this in mind.

1739
01:50:42,350 --> 01:50:43,350
Who told you?

1740
01:50:43,930 --> 01:50:44,890
Did you have a dream?

1741
01:50:45,310 --> 01:50:48,150
Going somewhere implies leaving
and returning, not staying there.

1742
01:50:48,480 --> 01:50:50,020
I used to think drinking was an addiction.

1743
01:50:50,350 --> 01:50:51,640
But a mother is also an addiction.

1744
01:50:51,890 --> 01:50:52,890
I feel that now.

1745
01:50:52,980 --> 01:50:54,400
Don't take her name here anymore.

1746
01:50:55,350 --> 01:50:57,350
Hey, your dad will hear.

1747
01:50:57,430 --> 01:50:58,350
Let him!

1748
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:00,060
I have heard why she left.

1749
01:51:00,350 --> 01:51:02,760
I have decided I don't want her.
Let him hear it!

1750
01:51:09,640 --> 01:51:11,970
{\an8}<i>All of us support Venkat Ramana. </i>

1751
01:51:35,770 --> 01:51:36,730
Madam!

1752
01:51:37,480 --> 01:51:38,440
Madam!

1753
01:51:40,980 --> 01:51:42,400
What do you have to say about this?

1754
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:45,650
-Sir, answer us!
-Can you tell us who's responsible?

1755
01:51:45,980 --> 01:51:47,110
We want to know!

1756
01:51:47,180 --> 01:51:48,890
Did she have enemies?

1757
01:51:49,480 --> 01:51:51,060
What's her condition now?

1758
01:51:51,180 --> 01:51:52,350
Answer us!

1759
01:52:30,600 --> 01:52:34,510
{\an8}<i>Law Minister Vyra Vasundhara</i>
<i>met with an accident today. </i>

1760
01:52:34,600 --> 01:52:38,260
{\an8}<i>A truck rammed into her convoy on the way</i>
<i>to the Secretariat, severely injuring her. </i>

1761
01:52:38,350 --> 01:52:41,720
<i>She was immediately rushed</i>
<i>to Axis Hospital, close by. </i>

1762
01:52:41,810 --> 01:52:45,730
<i>Doctors have confirmed injuries</i>
<i>to her head and arms. </i>

1763
01:52:45,810 --> 01:52:47,020
<i>We will keep you updated…</i>

1764
01:53:02,980 --> 01:53:06,270
<i>Minister Vyra Vasundhara is appearing</i>
<i>before the media in a short while!</i>

1765
01:53:06,350 --> 01:53:09,050
<i>There's a press meet</i>
<i>in the conference hall</i>

1766
01:53:09,140 --> 01:53:10,350
<i>on the first floor of Axis Hospital!</i>

1767
01:53:10,430 --> 01:53:14,140
<i>She is expected to give her health updates</i>
<i>and the reasons for the accident. </i>

1768
01:53:14,230 --> 01:53:15,770
<i>We have learned that</i>

1769
01:53:15,850 --> 01:53:18,680
<i>Minister Vyra Vasundhara</i>
<i>has been under treatment for two days. </i>

1770
01:53:18,770 --> 01:53:21,610
<i>The entire city…</i>

1771
01:53:22,350 --> 01:53:24,600
The opposition organized this attack.

1772
01:53:25,180 --> 01:53:27,300
They tried their best to kill me.

1773
01:53:27,640 --> 01:53:29,600
But my people's blessings saved me.

1774
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:32,020
Is your hand fractured?

1775
01:53:32,230 --> 01:53:33,650
Just a shoulder injury.

1776
01:53:36,730 --> 01:53:39,980
{\an8}Kata Madhu has criticized
that you have

1777
01:53:40,060 --> 01:53:41,400
-Listen…
-abandoned your elder son.

1778
01:53:41,730 --> 01:53:44,150
-This press meet is for her health.
-Oh.

1779
01:53:44,930 --> 01:53:47,220
Please don't divert the topic. Next.

1780
01:53:50,850 --> 01:53:54,220
Kata Madhu has said
that you've abandoned your elder son.

1781
01:53:54,310 --> 01:53:55,440
What do you have to say about that?

1782
01:53:56,430 --> 01:54:00,970
Ma'am, would you fight with rivals
like Hari Das and Madhu or let go?

1783
01:54:22,140 --> 01:54:24,680
I may let go of what I love.

1784
01:54:27,350 --> 01:54:29,010
I don't spare anything
that poses a threat to me.

1785
01:54:30,810 --> 01:54:34,440
In Kashi, the way we let go
of our favorite things for Ganga…

1786
01:54:35,640 --> 01:54:38,430
I have also let go
of some of my favorite ones.

1787
01:54:46,430 --> 01:54:48,760
We must somehow get Ramana back.

1788
01:54:50,100 --> 01:54:51,430
I need your help.

1789
01:54:51,890 --> 01:54:52,800
Let go.

1790
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:56,550
I don't insist out of adamance, Dad.

1791
01:54:56,850 --> 01:54:59,260
I didn't ask you
to let go of your adamance.

1792
01:55:00,310 --> 01:55:02,190
I meant, let go of your son.

1793
01:55:04,310 --> 01:55:05,400
Do you find it painful?

1794
01:55:06,640 --> 01:55:07,970
Well, you have raised him for ten years.

1795
01:55:09,390 --> 01:55:11,680
What about my pain
when I was asked to give up my daughter?

1796
01:55:12,730 --> 01:55:14,360
I had raised you for 25 years.

1797
01:55:15,730 --> 01:55:17,770
Your parenting for ten years is love.

1798
01:55:18,480 --> 01:55:21,150
But my parenting for 25 years
is selfishness?

1799
01:55:23,140 --> 01:55:26,260
If I am selfish, then so are you.

1800
01:55:27,310 --> 01:55:30,270
If yours is love,
then mine is bigger love.

1801
01:55:32,020 --> 01:55:34,150
If you still insist on going,
I won't stop you.

1802
01:55:36,310 --> 01:55:40,110
But this time when the warehouse
catches fire, your husband will be gone.

1803
01:55:40,480 --> 01:55:42,150
This time, it won't just
be an eye like before.

1804
01:55:42,770 --> 01:55:43,900
Your son himself will be gone.

1805
01:55:44,680 --> 01:55:46,430
-Dad?
-Yes!

1806
01:55:48,640 --> 01:55:49,640
Yes.

1807
01:55:51,430 --> 01:55:53,640
The matchstick that ignited
the Guntur warehouse,

1808
01:55:54,060 --> 01:55:56,770
the broken petrol bottles,
the expense of five lakh rupees,

1809
01:55:57,180 --> 01:56:00,350
Marx's pockets that held it,
and dead Lenin's blood.

1810
01:56:00,430 --> 01:56:01,390
Everything!

1811
01:56:01,640 --> 01:56:04,850
Your dad was the person behind it all.

1812
01:56:15,350 --> 01:56:17,930
Mothers may not always be right.

1813
01:56:18,930 --> 01:56:21,220
But they never go wrong
in fulfilling their responsibilities.

1814
01:56:24,270 --> 01:56:26,360
Madam, one minute.
Mr. Kata Madhu accuses you

1815
01:56:26,430 --> 01:56:28,350
-of leaving your elder son like an orphan.
-Enough.

1816
01:56:28,430 --> 01:56:29,550
What's your take on this?

1817
01:56:32,890 --> 01:56:33,930
I am a mother.

1818
01:56:34,930 --> 01:56:37,800
Never ask a mother
what she has done for her children.

1819
01:56:40,430 --> 01:56:42,140
You won't know even if I tell you.

1820
01:56:42,850 --> 01:56:44,550
You won't understand
even if you find out.

1821
01:57:03,020 --> 01:57:06,440
The media and we are aware that Hari Das
was responsible for this accident.

1822
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:07,770
Only you don't know.

1823
01:57:09,430 --> 01:57:11,260
But no one has the guts to speak up.

1824
01:57:12,230 --> 01:57:14,610
The driver would claim
the brakes were not working.

1825
01:57:14,680 --> 01:57:16,550
And he would be out in six months.

1826
01:57:17,140 --> 01:57:18,760
That is Hari Das.

1827
01:57:19,600 --> 01:57:24,050
People like you ignore rogues like him
but come and challenge old men like me.

1828
01:57:25,390 --> 01:57:26,760
Tell him if you have the guts.

1829
01:57:28,480 --> 01:57:30,020
"I am Vasundhara's son.

1830
01:57:31,310 --> 01:57:32,480
Face me if you can.

1831
01:57:32,810 --> 01:57:34,400
I am called Guntur Chili. "

1832
01:57:35,560 --> 01:57:38,060
Don't come up with excuses like
not knowing the address.

1833
01:57:38,310 --> 01:57:41,110
Everyone pays a visit after an accident.

1834
01:57:42,270 --> 01:57:43,770
Go and see him.

1835
01:57:44,930 --> 01:57:47,470
Then come, twirl your mustache,
and tell your mom, "I am your son. "

1836
01:57:48,060 --> 01:57:49,940
If you can't,
then weep and keep quiet.

1837
01:57:51,730 --> 01:57:53,900
Why do you always meddle with him,

1838
01:57:54,020 --> 01:57:57,020
make it a big issue,
and turn it into a calamity?

1839
01:57:57,850 --> 01:58:00,300
I mean,
you are so wise in political affairs!

1840
01:58:00,430 --> 01:58:03,390
When it comes to family,
why do you get so emotional?

1841
01:58:03,480 --> 01:58:04,610
-Pani!
-I don't get it.

1842
01:58:04,680 --> 01:58:06,140
-Sir.
-Let me tell you a story.

1843
01:58:06,310 --> 01:58:08,770
-Listen with some patience.
-Yes, sir.

1844
01:58:09,430 --> 01:58:12,510
A man built himself a solid fort
only by playing caste politics.

1845
01:58:13,180 --> 01:58:14,850
He won thrice consecutively.

1846
01:58:15,350 --> 01:58:18,550
His daughter got into
an inter-caste marriage and left him.

1847
01:58:18,850 --> 01:58:22,300
{\an8}<i>People said, "You couldn't make your</i>
<i>daughter marry into your own caste. </i>

1848
01:58:22,430 --> 01:58:23,970
<i>What can you possibly do for the others?"</i>

1849
01:58:24,560 --> 01:58:25,810
<i>-And he lost. </i>
<i>-With a huge margin…</i>

1850
01:58:25,890 --> 01:58:29,930
<i>-Mr. Niranjan has won! Congratulations!</i>
<i>-We won!</i>

1851
01:58:30,020 --> 01:58:33,770
<i>To win the election again, </i>
<i>his daughter would have to come back. </i>

1852
01:58:33,850 --> 01:58:35,220
He finally brought her back.

1853
01:58:36,850 --> 01:58:38,260
It was a massive fight!

1854
01:58:45,980 --> 01:58:47,310
-Narayan…
-Listen…

1855
01:58:47,390 --> 01:58:50,100
He stands a chance
if we take him to a hospital in the city.

1856
01:58:50,390 --> 01:58:53,390
What if he gets stuck in traffic
before reaching the hospital?

1857
01:58:53,770 --> 01:58:54,810
-What?
-Narayan!

1858
01:58:55,270 --> 01:58:57,770
-Let him die.
-Narayan…

1859
01:59:03,600 --> 01:59:05,510
He got his daughter married
into the same caste.

1860
01:59:05,770 --> 01:59:07,190
He made her contest elections.

1861
01:59:07,350 --> 01:59:09,550
Since she married into the same caste,
they elected her.

1862
01:59:09,640 --> 01:59:10,760
She even became a minister.

1863
01:59:11,390 --> 01:59:17,550
Now, he desires his grandson,
born into his own caste, to become an MP.

1864
01:59:17,980 --> 01:59:21,230
Exactly at that moment, here's what
appears on his daughter's phone.

1865
01:59:21,430 --> 01:59:22,350
Here…

1866
01:59:28,480 --> 01:59:31,610
Twenty-five years of control.
Isn't it slipping out of hand?

1867
01:59:33,310 --> 01:59:34,690
Where is emotion involved in all this?

1868
01:59:35,060 --> 01:59:36,520
It's all politics, right?

1869
01:59:57,020 --> 01:59:58,650
I haven't seen you before.

1870
02:00:00,350 --> 02:00:01,640
I never came here.

1871
02:00:03,020 --> 02:00:04,440
What brings you here now?

1872
02:00:06,980 --> 02:00:08,230
To eat some fritters.

1873
02:00:08,390 --> 02:00:10,220
Don't you get them in your place?

1874
02:00:11,930 --> 02:00:13,890
Each location
has its distinctive specialty.

1875
02:00:14,600 --> 02:00:15,970
What's special here?

1876
02:00:20,390 --> 02:00:21,300
Hari Das.

1877
02:00:24,100 --> 02:00:26,350
What is so special about him?

1878
02:00:26,980 --> 02:00:28,650
He wants to kill my mother.

1879
02:00:29,140 --> 02:00:30,510
Who is your mother?

1880
02:00:31,930 --> 02:00:32,930
Vyra Vasundhara.

1881
02:00:36,020 --> 02:00:37,270
My grandfather told me that…

1882
02:00:38,810 --> 02:00:41,400
he'd kill my mother
and I'd have to sit at home and cry.

1883
02:00:43,730 --> 02:00:44,770
Tell me, Uncle.

1884
02:00:45,890 --> 02:00:47,430
How disgusting it would be if I cried!

1885
02:00:49,230 --> 02:00:52,110
As disgusting as a wig
on your bald head!

1886
02:00:53,640 --> 02:00:54,550
That's why…

1887
02:00:55,270 --> 02:00:56,650
I have come to kill him.

1888
02:00:59,930 --> 02:01:01,850
-Are you carrying a knife?
-Yes.

1889
02:01:02,730 --> 02:01:04,230
Where are you hiding it?

1890
02:01:04,310 --> 02:01:05,770
Six feet one inch.

1891
02:01:06,310 --> 02:01:07,400
It's not possible to hide it.

1892
02:01:29,140 --> 02:01:31,430
Brother, there's a guy claiming
that he has come to kill you.

1893
02:01:34,980 --> 02:01:38,270
I've been here for the last 42 years.
I'll show you who Das is. Come on.

1894
02:01:41,140 --> 02:01:45,050
They say all the bandits
from Chambal came here and settled down.

1895
02:01:45,680 --> 02:01:48,220
Knives, bombs, you name it!

1896
02:01:48,310 --> 02:01:52,610
Everything needed for survival
and killing is available for sale here.

1897
02:01:52,770 --> 02:01:53,730
These youngsters?

1898
02:01:53,980 --> 02:01:56,520
Only they can act on impulse
without thinking of consequences.

1899
02:01:56,930 --> 02:01:59,350
That's why Hari Das only uses them.

1900
02:02:04,180 --> 02:02:06,390
Is this Hari Das?

1901
02:02:09,850 --> 02:02:10,890
That's quite a big head.

1902
02:02:11,350 --> 02:02:12,300
But I will pluck it and go.

1903
02:02:43,850 --> 02:02:44,970
What is this, Uncle?

1904
02:02:45,850 --> 02:02:47,180
Are they ladies or rowdies?

1905
02:02:51,560 --> 02:02:53,480
Even the sweepers are
delivering flying kicks!

1906
02:02:53,640 --> 02:02:55,300
You want Das's head, right?

1907
02:02:57,600 --> 02:02:58,510
Yes.

1908
02:02:58,600 --> 02:03:01,010
Hey! Basha, Jani, Khatri, Ahmed!

1909
02:03:01,180 --> 02:03:04,390
His legs, arms, neck, and torso…
hack them into pieces

1910
02:03:04,560 --> 02:03:07,650
and decide whether you
want to cremate or bury them.

1911
02:03:13,350 --> 02:03:15,600
While they decide,
could you get me some water?

1912
02:03:20,520 --> 02:03:21,480
Hey, Chotu!

1913
02:03:22,930 --> 02:03:24,720
Have you ever played Thief and Police?

1914
02:03:24,810 --> 02:03:26,400
Police don't come here, brother.

1915
02:03:27,020 --> 02:03:28,360
But the black guard is here.

1916
02:03:39,350 --> 02:03:40,550
Do you want to watch the game?

1917
02:04:17,430 --> 02:04:19,220
What are you looking at, sisters?

1918
02:04:22,100 --> 02:04:23,600
I will get him down.

1919
02:04:24,140 --> 02:04:25,430
You please get down to cooking.

1920
02:04:30,180 --> 02:04:31,890
The biryani should be delicious.

1921
02:04:32,430 --> 02:04:33,600
Make it spicy.

1922
02:05:14,020 --> 02:05:15,270
Why do you stare?

1923
02:05:16,810 --> 02:05:18,440
Is the cigarette appearing in 3D?

1924
02:06:06,770 --> 02:06:10,360
Oh, my brother!

1925
02:06:11,180 --> 02:06:13,350
My brother!

1926
02:06:16,770 --> 02:06:17,690
Hey!

1927
02:06:19,430 --> 02:06:21,550
I don't mind holding you by your hair
and smashing you to the ground!

1928
02:06:28,060 --> 02:06:29,020
What is happening, Uncle?

1929
02:06:30,230 --> 02:06:31,150
Are you Das?

1930
02:06:32,520 --> 02:06:33,440
Yes.

1931
02:06:37,810 --> 02:06:40,150
-What about him?
-He sells fritters.

1932
02:06:40,230 --> 02:06:41,360
Why were you sitting outside?

1933
02:06:42,730 --> 02:06:45,110
Whenever someone comes,
I sit at the fritter shop,

1934
02:06:45,180 --> 02:06:47,010
and he sits in my chair.

1935
02:06:47,100 --> 02:06:48,390
Oh, my!

1936
02:06:48,600 --> 02:06:49,510
But why?

1937
02:06:50,640 --> 02:06:52,180
To elude.

1938
02:06:58,180 --> 02:07:00,760
I saw such tricks long ago in old films.

1939
02:07:01,680 --> 02:07:03,510
And now, I see you.

1940
02:07:04,890 --> 02:07:06,600
It really hurts.

1941
02:07:06,680 --> 02:07:08,300
I'm not able to bear it.

1942
02:07:09,310 --> 02:07:11,270
What sin have I committed, God?

1943
02:07:11,350 --> 02:07:12,260
Shall I tell you?

1944
02:07:13,930 --> 02:07:15,390
Threatening the minister.

1945
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:18,560
Ramming a truck into their car
while they are inside.

1946
02:07:19,060 --> 02:07:23,060
God may be busy, but sons like me,
who gallivant with no work…

1947
02:07:24,100 --> 02:07:25,640
will come looking for you.

1948
02:07:26,810 --> 02:07:28,900
Why would I kill your mother?

1949
02:07:29,180 --> 02:07:31,100
I have only threatened her.

1950
02:07:31,560 --> 02:07:34,690
My problem is only… with your grandfather.

1951
02:07:36,180 --> 02:07:37,930
What has the old man done to you?

1952
02:07:38,020 --> 02:07:40,270
If I recall that, I will die right away.

1953
02:07:41,270 --> 02:07:43,440
Why remember that mess now?
Hey, keep quiet!

1954
02:07:43,520 --> 02:07:45,980
-What are you saying?
-Stop crying and pull this out.

1955
02:07:46,430 --> 02:07:47,550
Brother…

1956
02:07:47,640 --> 02:07:49,430
Hey! Sister!

1957
02:07:50,640 --> 02:07:52,640
-What are you trying to pull?
-Why?

1958
02:07:55,520 --> 02:07:57,270
I think it has pierced
right through the center.

1959
02:07:58,390 --> 02:08:01,550
If you pull it, blood will gush out
like water from a borewell.

1960
02:08:03,180 --> 02:08:05,100
At least suture it.

1961
02:08:05,310 --> 02:08:07,270
If I was so skilled, why would I be here?

1962
02:08:07,890 --> 02:08:10,800
Like AIIMS,
I would have set up RIMS in Guntur.

1963
02:08:13,680 --> 02:08:15,050
Only God can save you now.

1964
02:08:15,140 --> 02:08:16,550
Forget God!

1965
02:08:16,680 --> 02:08:18,850
Call a doctor.

1966
02:08:19,810 --> 02:08:22,560
There's not even a pharmacy nearby.

1967
02:08:22,640 --> 02:08:26,100
You are right.
Hey, call the ambulance, at least.

1968
02:08:27,140 --> 02:08:28,470
We don't have the number.

1969
02:08:31,140 --> 02:08:32,550
It's all over.

1970
02:08:33,140 --> 02:08:34,390
Go and get ready.

1971
02:08:39,980 --> 02:08:40,980
Hey, Balu!

1972
02:08:51,980 --> 02:08:53,860
Have you got a doctor for me?

1973
02:08:53,930 --> 02:08:55,260
No, I have brought him.

1974
02:08:57,270 --> 02:08:59,690
-Are you fine?
-Look who you gave my address to!

1975
02:09:03,520 --> 02:09:05,810
I'm the victim.
Why is the nurse looking at him?

1976
02:09:05,890 --> 02:09:07,100
That's his love, not a nurse.

1977
02:09:08,640 --> 02:09:10,180
She's the nurse. Do something.

1978
02:09:10,390 --> 02:09:11,510
Who did this to you?

1979
02:09:13,730 --> 02:09:15,610
Wow! Great person!

1980
02:09:15,890 --> 02:09:17,260
He has given you a second life.

1981
02:09:17,480 --> 02:09:21,020
I don't even have to put a stent.
98 percent of the valves were blocked.

1982
02:09:21,100 --> 02:09:23,300
By piercing with a nail,
he opened all of them.

1983
02:09:23,520 --> 02:09:24,860
But you need some blood.

1984
02:09:24,930 --> 02:09:26,100
B positive, doctor.

1985
02:09:26,180 --> 02:09:28,470
I'm definitely positive.
I'm asking for your blood group.

1986
02:09:28,810 --> 02:09:30,860
That's what I told you, doctor.
B positive!

1987
02:09:30,930 --> 02:09:32,010
But who will give the blood?

1988
02:09:32,520 --> 02:09:34,560
Hey! One of you come forward.

1989
02:09:34,810 --> 02:09:36,770
-Come on.
-How can we have blood?

1990
02:09:36,850 --> 02:09:38,300
-It's all alcohol.
-In that case,

1991
02:09:38,390 --> 02:09:39,970
remove the nail during cremation.

1992
02:09:42,390 --> 02:09:44,430
Shut up!

1993
02:09:44,520 --> 02:09:45,480
Oh, my!

1994
02:09:45,850 --> 02:09:47,850
Why do you start crying?

1995
02:09:47,930 --> 02:09:49,890
-One of you must donate your blood.
-How did this happen?

1996
02:09:52,560 --> 02:09:55,940
{\an8}The one who stabbed him is donating
his blood. This is a historical moment.

1997
02:09:59,270 --> 02:10:00,690
Keep these things aside.

1998
02:10:01,890 --> 02:10:03,260
What is your problem with my grandpa?

1999
02:10:03,480 --> 02:10:06,360
Both of us were into business together
25 years ago.

2000
02:10:06,480 --> 02:10:08,480
We got double returns.

2001
02:10:09,020 --> 02:10:10,810
What should the ratio be?

2002
02:10:11,100 --> 02:10:13,970
To be all fair and honest… fifty each?

2003
02:10:15,180 --> 02:10:18,100
He wanted ten percent more
since it was his idea.

2004
02:10:18,520 --> 02:10:19,440
Fair enough.

2005
02:10:19,850 --> 02:10:21,300
But you should get at least forty.

2006
02:10:21,640 --> 02:10:23,010
Claiming ownership of goodwill,

2007
02:10:23,100 --> 02:10:25,010
he insisted on an additional
ten percent as interest.

2008
02:10:25,180 --> 02:10:26,100
Fine.

2009
02:10:26,560 --> 02:10:27,810
Did he at least give you thirty?

2010
02:10:28,100 --> 02:10:31,970
Since supply had to continue, he sought
an additional ten percent for investment.

2011
02:10:32,350 --> 02:10:33,300
Terrible!

2012
02:10:33,730 --> 02:10:34,980
He should at least give you twenty.

2013
02:10:35,060 --> 02:10:38,520
He said I'd squander the money at once.
So, he wanted to pay in two installments.

2014
02:10:38,680 --> 02:10:39,850
Excellent.

2015
02:10:40,020 --> 02:10:41,020
What about the ten percent?

2016
02:10:41,100 --> 02:10:44,100
He gave me five,
and when I asked him about the rest,

2017
02:10:44,180 --> 02:10:47,680
he called me rowdy and kicked me out.

2018
02:10:49,980 --> 02:10:52,020
He showed you fifty percent profit
and gave you only five?

2019
02:10:52,100 --> 02:10:53,930
I wasn't hurt by that.

2020
02:10:54,270 --> 02:10:56,230
Do you know
what he did when I was leaving?

2021
02:10:57,350 --> 02:10:58,720
He gave this to me.

2022
02:11:01,390 --> 02:11:02,930
I knew that the old man was nasty.

2023
02:11:04,600 --> 02:11:06,220
I just didn't know how nasty!

2024
02:11:07,140 --> 02:11:08,100
Don't worry.

2025
02:11:08,930 --> 02:11:10,470
I will be the gun under your pillow.

2026
02:11:11,060 --> 02:11:12,020
Just give me a call.

2027
02:11:12,890 --> 02:11:13,800
I will be there.

2028
02:11:14,730 --> 02:11:15,610
Stop!

2029
02:11:18,140 --> 02:11:20,470
How can you donate blood
and just walk away?

2030
02:11:21,270 --> 02:11:22,770
You can't always have your way.

2031
02:11:23,480 --> 02:11:25,730
Let us at least throw you a party.

2032
02:11:27,100 --> 02:11:28,010
Hey!

2033
02:11:28,270 --> 02:11:30,230
Call our Ramola batch.

2034
02:11:36,890 --> 02:11:38,970
Young lad, pass me the chilled water.

2035
02:11:43,480 --> 02:11:45,980
<i>Salutations to the theater!</i>

2036
02:11:46,270 --> 02:11:49,610
<i>A grand welcome to connoisseurs!</i>

2037
02:11:49,980 --> 02:11:53,980
<i>The time is seven o'clock</i>
<i>The evening is dusky</i>

2038
02:11:54,230 --> 02:11:56,770
<i>The cool breeze begins to tickle</i>

2039
02:11:56,980 --> 02:12:02,940
<i>Daring Das seated on that couch</i>
<i>And the elegant prince on this one</i>

2040
02:12:03,270 --> 02:12:09,400
<i>Ramola dancing party's performance</i>

2041
02:12:09,770 --> 02:12:11,400
<i>Why don't we make it scintillating?</i>

2042
02:12:11,850 --> 02:12:13,010
Hey, Ramola!

2043
02:12:13,100 --> 02:12:14,850
Why don't we drape this girl in a sari?

2044
02:12:32,890 --> 02:12:34,800
<i>Ragamanjari from Rajahmundry</i>

2045
02:12:35,060 --> 02:12:38,520
<i>There's no one</i>
<i>Who doesn't know the mother of me</i>

2046
02:12:38,730 --> 02:12:44,400
<i>All are artists in the family</i>
<i>With our dance, we commit sleep robbery</i>

2047
02:12:50,350 --> 02:12:55,680
<i>Stylish, dream girl!</i>
<i>Your velvety look is a bed of jasmines</i>

2048
02:12:56,100 --> 02:13:01,930
<i>My breath is on fire</i>
<i>Looking at you makes my heart go crazy</i>

2049
02:13:07,810 --> 02:13:13,270
<i>Loading bullets in your curves</i>
<i>You fired shots, my belle</i>

2050
02:13:13,350 --> 02:13:15,470
<i>Seducing the entire male race…</i>

2051
02:13:16,560 --> 02:13:18,150
<i>Folding the chair…</i>

2052
02:13:18,480 --> 02:13:22,730
<i>Folding the chair…</i>
<i>Folding it…</i>

2053
02:13:22,810 --> 02:13:25,690
<i>Folding it…</i>
<i>Folding it…</i>

2054
02:13:54,770 --> 02:13:57,560
<i>To her…</i>

2055
02:13:57,680 --> 02:14:03,010
<i>To her, you gifted the goats</i>
<i>And gave me broken rice</i>

2056
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:09,900
<i>The goats grew into hundreds and herds</i>
<i>And my broken rice melted in titbits</i>

2057
02:14:12,230 --> 02:14:17,900
<i>You gave her emerald earrings</i>
<i>You gave me dotted, checkered saris</i>

2058
02:14:18,060 --> 02:14:23,810
<i>Her earrings shone with sparkles</i>
<i>My saris turned into tatters</i>

2059
02:14:23,890 --> 02:14:29,430
<i>What sort of patron are you, Mr. Das?</i>
<i>You are always with prejudice!</i>

2060
02:14:29,680 --> 02:14:35,350
<i>What sort of patron are you, Mr. Das?</i>
<i>You are always with prejudice!</i>

2061
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:36,900
<i>Folding the chair…</i>

2062
02:14:36,980 --> 02:14:39,810
<i>Folding it…</i>
<i>Folding it…</i>

2063
02:14:39,890 --> 02:14:42,800
<i>Folding it…</i>
<i>Folding it…</i>

2064
02:14:58,810 --> 02:15:03,060
<i>-Such a stylish, beautiful lady</i>
<i>-Folding it…</i>

2065
02:15:03,140 --> 02:15:05,970
<i>-Your velvety look is a bed of jasmines</i>
<i>-Folding it…</i>

2066
02:15:06,060 --> 02:15:08,900
<i>-My breath is on fire</i>
<i>-Folding it…</i>

2067
02:15:08,980 --> 02:15:12,020
<i>Looking at you makes my heart go crazy</i>

2068
02:15:23,520 --> 02:15:24,730
What are you looking at?

2069
02:15:25,100 --> 02:15:27,010
Each one is a lyric writer
of his own anguish.

2070
02:15:27,390 --> 02:15:29,260
Write it, fold it, and throw it.

2071
02:15:29,350 --> 02:15:32,140
<i>Folding it…</i>

2072
02:15:32,230 --> 02:15:35,060
<i>Folding it…</i>

2073
02:15:35,140 --> 02:15:39,430
<i>Folding it…</i>

2074
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:40,940
<i>Folding the chair…</i>

2075
02:15:42,520 --> 02:15:43,940
<i>Folding it…</i>

2076
02:15:45,310 --> 02:15:46,810
<i>Folding it…</i>

2077
02:15:48,180 --> 02:15:49,760
<i>Folding it…</i>

2078
02:15:54,560 --> 02:15:55,940
Just one word.

2079
02:15:56,270 --> 02:15:58,400
There's no one like you!

2080
02:15:58,770 --> 02:16:00,900
-Long live…
-Jandal Party!

2081
02:16:00,980 --> 02:16:03,190
{\an8}-Long live…
-Jandal Party!

2082
02:16:03,270 --> 02:16:05,520
{\an8}-Long live…
-Jandal Party!

2083
02:16:05,600 --> 02:16:07,890
-Long live…
-Jandal Party!

2084
02:16:07,980 --> 02:16:09,360
-Long live…
-Sir.

2085
02:16:09,430 --> 02:16:11,680
-Jandal Party!
-Stop.

2086
02:16:11,770 --> 02:16:13,690
-Long live…
-Please wait.

2087
02:16:13,770 --> 02:16:16,270
-Enough. Okay.
-Jandal Party!

2088
02:16:16,350 --> 02:16:18,220
-Sir…
-Wait.

2089
02:16:18,310 --> 02:16:19,770
-Okay. Move.
-Long live…

2090
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:22,730
-Where is Raja Gopal?
-Didn't he come with you, sir?

2091
02:16:23,350 --> 02:16:25,510
-Long live…
-Jandal Party!

2092
02:16:25,600 --> 02:16:28,890
-Long live…
-Jandal Party!

2093
02:16:28,980 --> 02:16:30,150
-Mr. Gopal.
-Gopal.

2094
02:16:30,310 --> 02:16:31,690
Where's Gopal? Have you seen him?

2095
02:16:31,930 --> 02:16:33,390
-Gopal!
-Okay.

2096
02:16:33,480 --> 02:16:34,360
Mr. Gopal!

2097
02:16:34,480 --> 02:16:35,400
Mr. Gopal.

2098
02:16:35,850 --> 02:16:37,180
-Mr. Gopal!
-Narayan!

2099
02:16:38,430 --> 02:16:40,100
-Where are you?
-Narayan!

2100
02:16:41,980 --> 02:16:43,230
Drunkard…

2101
02:16:43,390 --> 02:16:44,680
Get up!

2102
02:16:45,480 --> 02:16:46,730
-Father-in-law?
-Where is he?

2103
02:16:47,890 --> 02:16:49,260
-Who?
-Who else?

2104
02:16:49,350 --> 02:16:51,050
-Your own son!
-My son…

2105
02:16:51,230 --> 02:16:52,310
He has left home.

2106
02:16:52,480 --> 02:16:53,900
But he's nowhere to be found.
Where is he?

2107
02:16:54,980 --> 02:16:56,860
He must be somewhere around.

2108
02:16:57,060 --> 02:16:58,480
Oh, there he is!

2109
02:17:01,480 --> 02:17:02,480
What did you do?

2110
02:17:03,100 --> 02:17:04,010
Actually…

2111
02:17:04,270 --> 02:17:05,610
He has joined the Party.

2112
02:17:05,850 --> 02:17:07,390
He's also getting the MP ticket.

2113
02:17:07,560 --> 02:17:08,980
He said he was feeling nervous…

2114
02:17:09,140 --> 02:17:10,050
So?

2115
02:17:10,890 --> 02:17:13,970
To pep him up,
I gave him a glass of juice.

2116
02:17:14,390 --> 02:17:15,260
Oh, no!

2117
02:17:16,640 --> 02:17:17,640
Hey, Gopal!

2118
02:17:18,850 --> 02:17:20,010
I think he's in a stupor.

2119
02:17:20,140 --> 02:17:22,390
Father-in-law, I will get him ready
in ten minutes.

2120
02:17:22,480 --> 02:17:25,270
-Hey! Someone get some curd--
-You should be killed, wastrel!

2121
02:17:25,350 --> 02:17:28,970
What are you doing?
Why are you hitting me?! Father-in-law!

2122
02:17:29,140 --> 02:17:30,010
I was…

2123
02:17:30,100 --> 02:17:32,050
I was going to make him join the Party,

2124
02:17:32,140 --> 02:17:34,760
-but you organized your own party!
-Don't hit me!

2125
02:17:34,850 --> 02:17:36,680
-And today of all the days!
-What did I do?

2126
02:17:36,770 --> 02:17:39,360
He is the future of this family
and politics!

2127
02:17:39,520 --> 02:17:41,060
-Not a wastrel like you!
-Don't hit me!

2128
02:17:41,430 --> 02:17:43,850
He is Vyra Venkat Swamy's heir!

2129
02:17:44,140 --> 02:17:45,890
-You--
-Who? Who is the heir?!

2130
02:17:46,850 --> 02:17:47,930
He is not even my son!

2131
02:17:48,810 --> 02:17:50,400
I don't even have a son!

2132
02:17:58,600 --> 02:17:59,800
I don't even have a son!

2133
02:18:01,520 --> 02:18:04,610
Whether you like it or not,
you have only one heir!

2134
02:18:08,060 --> 02:18:09,980
Bhogineni Veera Venkat Ramana!

2135
02:18:17,270 --> 02:18:18,940
He is your real heir!

2136
02:18:35,060 --> 02:18:37,270
Are you so drunk
that you are blabbering?

2137
02:18:38,890 --> 02:18:39,800
I am sober!

2138
02:18:42,980 --> 02:18:44,610
Exactly 25 years ago…

2139
02:18:45,770 --> 02:18:48,310
your daughter married a man
from a different caste.

2140
02:18:49,270 --> 02:18:50,770
Then you got her married to him.

2141
02:18:51,810 --> 02:18:55,480
By the time the next elections occurred,
you pulled the strings.

2142
02:18:56,930 --> 02:19:00,640
Now, just as your grandson
is about to enter politics,

2143
02:19:00,850 --> 02:19:02,720
your daughter is pulling the strings.

2144
02:19:04,930 --> 02:19:09,510
Your daughter didn't marry me
because she thought I was handsome.

2145
02:19:10,980 --> 02:19:12,860
She married me to make a fool of you.

2146
02:19:15,980 --> 02:19:18,360
Fortunately, since our bedroom
is on the first floor,

2147
02:19:18,520 --> 02:19:20,270
you're unable to climb the stairs.

2148
02:19:20,930 --> 02:19:23,890
Let me tell you
that there are two beds in there.

2149
02:19:24,680 --> 02:19:27,100
You can place a net between them
and play badminton.

2150
02:19:27,350 --> 02:19:28,390
That's the situation.

2151
02:19:29,730 --> 02:19:32,560
As soon as you began to wonder
why there were no children yet,

2152
02:19:32,640 --> 02:19:33,640
she announced her pregnancy.

2153
02:19:34,270 --> 02:19:37,020
She said she would be more comfortable
delivering the baby abroad,

2154
02:19:37,100 --> 02:19:38,930
and went to Aunt Rani in Australia.

2155
02:19:39,060 --> 02:19:40,110
Once she reached there,

2156
02:19:40,180 --> 02:19:42,930
she said she didn't want to trouble them
and stayed alone.

2157
02:19:43,600 --> 02:19:47,220
Have you ever seen her photograph
when she was pregnant?

2158
02:19:50,390 --> 02:19:51,260
No.

2159
02:19:51,850 --> 02:19:52,720
I knew it.

2160
02:19:53,520 --> 02:19:54,440
She came back with him.

2161
02:19:55,430 --> 02:19:56,640
You took him.

2162
02:19:56,730 --> 02:19:57,860
Carried him on your back.

2163
02:19:58,430 --> 02:19:59,760
When he cried, you called it music!

2164
02:20:00,180 --> 02:20:01,510
When he peed, you called it perfume!

2165
02:20:02,560 --> 02:20:06,360
If you gave him my surname,
you thought he wouldn't get any votes.

2166
02:20:06,520 --> 02:20:08,610
So, you call him Vyra Rajagopal!

2167
02:20:09,140 --> 02:20:10,390
You are making him an MP now.

2168
02:20:11,270 --> 02:20:13,360
If all goes well,
you would make him the PM as well.

2169
02:20:16,350 --> 02:20:19,510
But if you realize
he is not your daughter's son…

2170
02:20:21,770 --> 02:20:22,690
what will you do?

2171
02:20:26,180 --> 02:20:28,140
Your daughter is not boastful like you.

2172
02:20:28,390 --> 02:20:29,350
No way!

2173
02:20:30,390 --> 02:20:31,760
She sent her husband to jail.

2174
02:20:32,390 --> 02:20:33,890
<i>You trusted her 25 percent. </i>

2175
02:20:34,480 --> 02:20:37,060
She married me.
You trusted her 50 percent.

2176
02:20:37,310 --> 02:20:38,650
She said she gave birth to him.

2177
02:20:38,850 --> 02:20:40,260
<i>You trusted her 75 percent. </i>

2178
02:20:40,520 --> 02:20:41,860
She abandoned her own son.

2179
02:20:43,350 --> 02:20:44,850
You trusted her a hundred percent!

2180
02:20:46,680 --> 02:20:51,300
She has proved that a mother would go
to any extent to protect her son. Wow!

2181
02:20:52,770 --> 02:20:54,310
Your daughter is not an ordinary woman.

2182
02:21:01,680 --> 02:21:05,350
She can easily manipulate three men
like you into following her plan!

2183
02:21:05,980 --> 02:21:07,810
-You should have told me this earlier…
-Relax.

2184
02:21:08,060 --> 02:21:11,400
Actually, once you cross 70,

2185
02:21:12,270 --> 02:21:14,150
people like you
shouldn't stay alive.

2186
02:21:14,560 --> 02:21:15,730
You must make your exit.

2187
02:21:16,770 --> 02:21:17,690
You should.

2188
02:21:17,930 --> 02:21:19,510
That would do good to everyone.

2189
02:21:20,270 --> 02:21:21,190
Please die.

2190
02:21:21,520 --> 02:21:23,190
-Heed my advice.
-Grandpa, don't be angry!

2191
02:21:23,480 --> 02:21:25,650
Hey! Who is your grandpa?!

2192
02:21:27,930 --> 02:21:29,140
Who is your grandpa?

2193
02:21:32,180 --> 02:21:34,800
All of you are playing a game
behind my back, right?

2194
02:21:35,430 --> 02:21:36,550
I'm going to kill you.

2195
02:21:37,480 --> 02:21:39,110
She's the one behind all this, right?

2196
02:21:39,640 --> 02:21:41,760
She should be killed first!

2197
02:21:43,560 --> 02:21:45,810
In that case,
you should be killed a hundred times.

2198
02:21:48,980 --> 02:21:50,190
I couldn't stop him, sir.

2199
02:21:53,770 --> 02:21:54,810
When did you get here?

2200
02:21:56,230 --> 02:21:58,400
Did you walk in quietly like a thief?

2201
02:22:02,430 --> 02:22:03,600
I was missing you.

2202
02:22:05,390 --> 02:22:06,430
So, I have come to talk.

2203
02:22:06,520 --> 02:22:08,610
I would also like to talk.
Come. Let's talk.

2204
02:22:08,770 --> 02:22:10,230
Hey, get a chair. Come on.

2205
02:22:10,480 --> 02:22:14,900
Normally, people discuss their kids'
future. We'll discuss your mom's past.

2206
02:22:17,020 --> 02:22:19,060
Is your mom some goddess in a temple?

2207
02:22:19,270 --> 02:22:20,560
You want to visit her all the time!

2208
02:22:21,600 --> 02:22:22,640
She's a demon!

2209
02:22:24,180 --> 02:22:25,470
Really?

2210
02:22:25,890 --> 02:22:27,390
Why did you orchestrate the accident?

2211
02:22:27,480 --> 02:22:28,480
Which accident?

2212
02:22:28,680 --> 02:22:30,930
The one in which you made a truck
ram into her car?

2213
02:22:35,020 --> 02:22:36,650
Hey, get me some water.

2214
02:22:37,350 --> 02:22:38,510
That accident.

2215
02:22:38,600 --> 02:22:39,930
Ask Hari Das!

2216
02:22:43,310 --> 02:22:44,230
Hey!

2217
02:22:47,390 --> 02:22:48,800
Give him the glass, Dasu.

2218
02:22:50,770 --> 02:22:52,020
Why are you shocked?

2219
02:22:53,560 --> 02:22:54,560
It's our very own Das.

2220
02:22:55,020 --> 02:22:57,150
That water is not going
to wash away your sins.

2221
02:22:59,770 --> 02:23:00,940
Whose truck was it?

2222
02:23:01,350 --> 02:23:02,600
Aren't there enough rogues?

2223
02:23:02,850 --> 02:23:04,470
If not him,
it must have been Kata Madhu's job!

2224
02:23:05,640 --> 02:23:07,100
You could fall. Sit down.

2225
02:23:18,890 --> 02:23:20,800
Have you joined hands with him?

2226
02:23:23,140 --> 02:23:24,970
As a precaution, I have brought him along.

2227
02:23:25,770 --> 02:23:27,270
Please don't say
he was behind the accident.

2228
02:23:27,730 --> 02:23:29,610
Because he himself is ramming
into things and falling.

2229
02:23:31,600 --> 02:23:32,680
Why did you do it?

2230
02:23:34,640 --> 02:23:37,680
Do you think it is easy to win
the fourth time after three terms?

2231
02:23:38,310 --> 02:23:39,940
There has to be some magic.

2232
02:23:42,390 --> 02:23:45,140
I organized a murder attempt.
I created sympathy.

2233
02:23:45,520 --> 02:23:46,650
Go, check the surveys.

2234
02:23:46,980 --> 02:23:48,400
They confirm her victory.

2235
02:23:49,270 --> 02:23:50,730
Anyway, what is the problem now?

2236
02:23:52,140 --> 02:23:53,140
She is not dead…

2237
02:23:53,890 --> 02:23:55,680
Hey! Let him go!

2238
02:23:58,270 --> 02:24:02,900
A little harder, and there won't be
any need for surveys.

2239
02:24:03,520 --> 02:24:05,690
She's sure to secure victory
through sympathy.

2240
02:24:20,480 --> 02:24:22,560
As soon as you discovered
he was not your grandson,

2241
02:24:22,640 --> 02:24:23,760
you discarded him.

2242
02:24:24,230 --> 02:24:27,150
But she raised him
like her own son for thirty years.

2243
02:24:27,230 --> 02:24:29,480
Hey, I'm not jealous of you.
Please don't feel bad.

2244
02:24:32,270 --> 02:24:34,270
Her action was betrayal,
and yours was sacrifice?

2245
02:24:37,060 --> 02:24:40,190
Shall I give you a list of her sacrifices?
Your heart will stop.

2246
02:24:41,390 --> 02:24:42,760
A pointless wedding.

2247
02:24:43,730 --> 02:24:45,020
A meaningless marriage.

2248
02:24:47,480 --> 02:24:48,690
A son who's not her own.

2249
02:24:49,890 --> 02:24:51,390
And an unsolicited rank.

2250
02:24:52,520 --> 02:24:53,650
For whom did she do all this?

2251
02:24:54,680 --> 02:24:56,220
She did it so that Ramana
could live like a king!

2252
02:24:58,270 --> 02:24:59,400
I failed to understand it then.

2253
02:24:59,980 --> 02:25:00,940
I'm a dunderhead!

2254
02:25:02,640 --> 02:25:04,050
I'm not sure if you said it
knowingly or not…

2255
02:25:04,270 --> 02:25:05,190
but she is truly a goddess.

2256
02:25:05,770 --> 02:25:06,980
Any place she is becomes a temple.

2257
02:25:08,180 --> 02:25:10,140
When she leaves tomorrow,
you will know…

2258
02:25:10,810 --> 02:25:12,480
Forget about a sacred offering,

2259
02:25:12,850 --> 02:25:14,550
no one would even pay you a visit.

2260
02:25:27,810 --> 02:25:29,730
With so much love in your heart,

2261
02:25:30,480 --> 02:25:31,650
you choose to fight.

2262
02:25:32,730 --> 02:25:34,860
Is shouting Ramana's way
of expressing love?

2263
02:25:35,640 --> 02:25:36,510
Come.

2264
02:25:37,480 --> 02:25:40,940
You have done whatever you want,
and now look at you talking!

2265
02:25:41,390 --> 02:25:42,850
What have I done, Dad?

2266
02:25:43,520 --> 02:25:44,940
Did I set the warehouses on fire?

2267
02:25:45,480 --> 02:25:46,810
Did I organize murders?

2268
02:25:47,930 --> 02:25:49,550
I just wanted him to do well.

2269
02:25:49,730 --> 02:25:50,860
Is that a crime?

2270
02:25:52,390 --> 02:25:56,050
You've arranged for a survey
on election result trends if I die.

2271
02:25:56,480 --> 02:25:58,940
Now that I'm leaving,
get a fresh survey done.

2272
02:25:59,020 --> 02:25:59,980
Where will you go?

2273
02:26:00,890 --> 02:26:01,800
If you go,

2274
02:26:01,890 --> 02:26:04,970
I'll kill everyone in that place!

2275
02:26:05,270 --> 02:26:07,690
You're threatening me
even after you saw him?

2276
02:26:08,730 --> 02:26:10,650
Back then, he was as tall as your knee.

2277
02:26:11,020 --> 02:26:13,230
Now, he has made you kneel!

2278
02:26:13,310 --> 02:26:14,310
What the heck?

2279
02:26:14,730 --> 02:26:16,480
Why are you talking nonsense like him?

2280
02:26:17,600 --> 02:26:19,760
Why would I talk like him, Dad?

2281
02:26:20,310 --> 02:26:22,310
He talks like me.

2282
02:26:23,100 --> 02:26:24,510
Because he is my son.

2283
02:26:27,930 --> 02:26:28,800
Son?!

2284
02:26:29,140 --> 02:26:30,470
I will show you…

2285
02:26:34,600 --> 02:26:35,800
Can you say that again?

2286
02:26:37,980 --> 02:26:39,270
You are my son.

2287
02:26:45,930 --> 02:26:47,260
Why didn't you tell me all these years?

2288
02:26:48,600 --> 02:26:51,260
Feelings aren't beholden to words, Son.

2289
02:26:57,180 --> 02:26:58,390
When I came home, I was kicked out.

2290
02:26:58,980 --> 02:27:00,610
But I watched you from upstairs.

2291
02:27:04,680 --> 02:27:05,890
Why did you slap me?

2292
02:27:06,480 --> 02:27:07,980
I wanted to touch you.

2293
02:27:11,770 --> 02:27:13,270
At the hospital,
you said you didn't like me.

2294
02:27:14,350 --> 02:27:16,890
Before that, I mentioned
my favorite things, didn't I?

2295
02:27:17,680 --> 02:27:18,600
Before what?

2296
02:27:19,850 --> 02:27:20,720
Son…

2297
02:27:21,730 --> 02:27:23,610
When you were a child,
you used to bother me about food.

2298
02:27:24,640 --> 02:27:26,470
Now, you want to trouble me
about talking?

2299
02:27:28,230 --> 02:27:30,980
Only death can separate
a mother from her son.

2300
02:27:43,310 --> 02:27:44,940
Bloody hell, Venkat Swamy!

2301
02:27:46,060 --> 02:27:49,230
Waiting another 25 years
to hear this again would be worthwhile.

2302
02:27:50,980 --> 02:27:53,060
When she speaks,
it's not just my ears that listen,

2303
02:27:53,810 --> 02:27:55,270
but my entire body.

2304
02:27:55,980 --> 02:27:57,060
-Hey!
-Hey!

2305
02:27:57,180 --> 02:27:58,800
Why do you want to talk to him?
Come on.

2306
02:28:00,140 --> 02:28:01,050
Hey!

2307
02:28:01,350 --> 02:28:02,220
Wait!

2308
02:28:03,270 --> 02:28:05,520
Hey, wait!

2309
02:28:07,520 --> 02:28:09,440
Hey!

2310
02:28:12,930 --> 02:28:13,850
Hey!

2311
02:28:18,060 --> 02:28:19,190
Long live…

2312
02:28:20,270 --> 02:28:21,480
Long live…

2313
02:28:22,310 --> 02:28:23,560
Long live…

2314
02:29:33,730 --> 02:29:34,650
What is it?

2315
02:29:38,640 --> 02:29:39,970
As soon as I saw you…

2316
02:29:41,230 --> 02:29:42,610
I wanted to pick a big fight.

2317
02:29:44,310 --> 02:29:46,150
But the moment you touched me,
I forgot everything.

2318
02:29:49,980 --> 02:29:50,860
What?

2319
02:29:51,480 --> 02:29:52,770
You are so handsome.

2320
02:29:53,600 --> 02:29:55,600
-Why the beard?
-This?

2321
02:29:58,140 --> 02:29:59,100
Love failure.

2322
02:30:00,600 --> 02:30:01,470
Hey!

2323
02:30:01,930 --> 02:30:02,850
Who is the girl?

2324
02:30:06,480 --> 02:30:07,360
You.

2325
02:30:14,180 --> 02:30:15,890
Hey, when did you get here?

2326
02:30:28,640 --> 02:30:29,550
Bujji…

2327
02:30:36,560 --> 02:30:37,560
How are you?

2328
02:30:44,180 --> 02:30:45,140
Bujji!

2329
02:30:45,270 --> 02:30:46,690
Bujji… Bujji!

2330
02:31:01,980 --> 02:31:03,060
Sister-in-law…

2331
02:31:40,890 --> 02:31:42,300
How are you, Satya?

2332
02:31:44,390 --> 02:31:45,300
How are you?

2333
02:31:49,980 --> 02:31:50,980
My room…

2334
02:31:53,850 --> 02:31:54,890
your memories…

2335
02:31:58,060 --> 02:31:59,810
Here… like this…

2336
02:32:22,850 --> 02:32:24,180
Old songs…

2337
02:32:25,180 --> 02:32:26,550
Old bike…

2338
02:32:28,930 --> 02:32:29,930
Old wife…

2339
02:32:33,310 --> 02:32:34,310
I didn't give up anything.

2340
02:32:40,270 --> 02:32:44,810
Did it take you so long
to stop being angry with me?

2341
02:32:47,680 --> 02:32:52,720
It took me so many years
to stop being afraid of my dad.

2342
02:33:17,100 --> 02:33:18,930
You were so hurt
that you had shut the door on her.

2343
02:33:21,180 --> 02:33:22,470
Today, you opened
the door to her yourself.

2344
02:33:23,270 --> 02:33:24,310
It's even now.

2345
02:33:37,270 --> 02:33:38,440
-Hey, Samba!
-Yes?

2346
02:33:39,180 --> 02:33:40,890
Shall I give you a nice caption?

2347
02:33:42,350 --> 02:33:43,510
"Ramana is rebellious…

2348
02:33:44,520 --> 02:33:46,110
because he has two mothers. "

2349
02:34:09,180 --> 02:34:11,100
{\an8}Hey, Venkat Swamy is calling.

2350
02:34:15,100 --> 02:34:16,550
Cut the call and block him.

2351
02:34:22,600 --> 02:34:25,300
All this while you have been sharpening
a needle instead of a knife.

2352
02:34:25,890 --> 02:34:27,680
I will start sharpening
the knife then.

2353
02:34:28,770 --> 02:34:30,690
My constituency should not be orphaned.

2354
02:34:31,390 --> 02:34:32,600
We need Ramana.

2355
02:34:33,020 --> 02:34:34,020
He won't come.

2356
02:34:34,270 --> 02:34:35,560
What would bring him to us?

2357
02:34:35,980 --> 02:34:36,940
Father-in-law…

2358
02:34:37,310 --> 02:34:40,110
during every festival, we decorate
with festoons made of mango leaves.

2359
02:34:40,640 --> 02:34:42,260
It's considered auspicious, right?

2360
02:34:42,480 --> 02:34:44,060
After a few days, the leaves dry up,

2361
02:34:44,140 --> 02:34:48,010
and the rustling sound they make
becomes irritating to the ear.

2362
02:34:48,140 --> 02:34:51,470
We can't discard it
due to sentimental reasons.

2363
02:34:52,480 --> 02:34:53,690
You are just like that.

2364
02:34:54,060 --> 02:34:56,860
Discarding you would be a sin
while keeping you would pose a risk.

2365
02:34:57,520 --> 02:34:58,730
Drop the matter.

2366
02:35:13,560 --> 02:35:15,060
-He isn't home.
-I know.

2367
02:35:15,430 --> 02:35:16,300
Wow!

2368
02:35:16,390 --> 02:35:17,260
Hi, sir.

2369
02:35:17,520 --> 02:35:18,440
-Hey!
-Sir?

2370
02:35:18,640 --> 02:35:20,300
-Are those clothes?
-Yes, sir.

2371
02:35:20,520 --> 02:35:22,310
-Bought or tailored?
-Ready-made, sir.

2372
02:35:23,560 --> 02:35:24,560
Shall we go?

2373
02:35:24,890 --> 02:35:25,800
Where to, sir?

2374
02:35:26,100 --> 02:35:27,050
Why do you care?

2375
02:35:27,390 --> 02:35:28,550
When will you be back?

2376
02:35:29,020 --> 02:35:30,810
-Tomorrow evening.
-Tomorrow evening?

2377
02:35:31,180 --> 02:35:32,510
What should I tell Mr. Pani?

2378
02:35:32,730 --> 02:35:33,900
Tell him she has eloped.

2379
02:35:35,100 --> 02:35:37,640
I carried her to school
with these hands, sir.

2380
02:35:38,020 --> 02:35:39,610
Using the same hands,
lead her to the wedding altar.

2381
02:35:42,890 --> 02:35:43,890
Careful, sir.

2382
02:35:44,480 --> 02:35:45,440
Your sari…

2383
02:35:47,770 --> 02:35:49,810
-If it weren't for you, Balu…
-Sir?

2384
02:35:50,560 --> 02:35:53,940
I would have driven her to Guntur
in my Jeep the very first day I saw her!

2385
02:35:54,520 --> 02:35:55,610
First day!

2386
02:35:57,060 --> 02:35:58,520
That's what you are doing right now, sir.
