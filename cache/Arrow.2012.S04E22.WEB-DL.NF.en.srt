Wow.

00:00:12,387 --> 00:00:14,389
Cool.
You know, I didn't even mean to do that.

00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,937
I turn steel arrows into dust,
and you thought lead would do the trick?

Oh, I'm still human. Just better.

Well, not right now, at least.

00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,401
She used to be a lot different.

310
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,952
All clear. Looks like
we bought ourselves a few minutes.

311
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,788
John, this place is enormous.
I don't know how we're going to find Thea.

312
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,874
Just have to make sure
that the Ghosts don't find us.

313
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,130
So much for clear.

314
00:17:30,882 --> 00:17:32,051
We're not going to hurt you.

315
00:17:32,343 --> 00:17:33,885
Then what are the weapons for?

316
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:37,889
There's a woman
being held against her will.

317
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,475
We're just here to bring her home.

318
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,853
<i>Citizens of Tevat Noah,
I have disturbing news.</i>

319
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:45,231
<i>We are under attack
from a man in a green hood</i>

320
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,690
<i>and another in a black helmet.</i>

321
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,568
<i>Do not let them disrupt Genesis.</i>

322
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:53,655
<i>These individuals
are not only an affront to our home,</i>

323
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:57,159
<i>but to our future
and the futures of our children.</i>

324
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,994
<i>Find them and kill them.</i>

325
00:18:03,374 --> 00:18:04,416
OLIVER: Oh, no.

326
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,502
It's okay, Oliver. (BREATHING DEEPLY)

327
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,837
I know what to do now.

328
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,216
I finally understand
what Reiter was after.

329
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,677
OLIVER: Taiana, Reiter was insane.

330
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,970
TAIANA: Why?

331
00:18:17,053 --> 00:18:21,267
He said after his village was destroyed,
he would never be powerless again.

332
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:24,645
I have a village, too, Krasnoyarsk,

333
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:27,314
run by a government strongman named Kovar.

334
00:18:27,398 --> 00:18:28,357
Taiana...

335
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,859
Now I know
why fate has led me to this place.

336
00:18:30,942 --> 00:18:33,529
To give me the strength to free my home.

337
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,656
Okay. All right.

338
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:40,035
You'll go back to Russia,
and you can take on this Kovar.

339
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,497
But right now there are people here
that need our help.

340
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:47,459
What would Vlad want you to do?

341
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,131
What would your brother expect you to do?

342
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:56,051
Find these hostiles at once.

343
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,596
Nothing can be permitted
to stand in the way of Genesis.

344
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,681
Thank you.

345
00:19:02,098 --> 00:19:06,687
I'm not sure murdering vigilantes is what
your loyal supporters signed up for.

346
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,358
Well, you better hope that
they don't find Mr. Queen and Mr. Diggle

347
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:12,484
before you do, Malcolm,

348
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:16,738
or I'll be forced to seriously question
what your purpose here is.

349
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,540
Every time I knock down a firewall,
five more pop back up.

350
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:29,125
It would seem that Mr. Darhk
has a counter-hacker in his employ.

351
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,877
-And he's good.
-Yeah.

352
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,922
Okay. I might have something.

353
00:19:34,005 --> 00:19:37,343
Now, until the FBI gets their way,
smartphones are protected by encryption.

354
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,803
If you don't enter your passcode
after enough times,

355
00:19:39,886 --> 00:19:41,722
then the device bricks itself, right?

356
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:44,308
Curtis, I don't even have the time
to tell you that I don't have the time.

357
00:19:44,391 --> 00:19:45,934
You just did. But, here's the point.

358
00:19:46,017 --> 00:19:47,769
Instead of trying
to break Rubicon's encryption...

359
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:48,979
We make it stop working
in the first place.

360
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:51,440
You're suggesting
as it is with a smartphone.

361
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,650
We overload Rubicon
with too many access requests.

362
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:54,776
And it shuts itself down.

363
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,778
Unfortunately, I doubt very much
that A.R.G.U.S.

364
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:00,949
would leave Rubicon so vulnerable
to such a brute force attack.

365
00:20:01,032 --> 00:20:02,243
Let them try.

366
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,077
You're always such a stick in the mud.

367
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,372
Yes!

368
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:07,956
Let's all take hacking advice

369
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:11,793
from a woman whose only use
for her smartphone is as a mirror.

371
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,047
So funny. Not.

372
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,884
Felicity may have gotten
her brains from you,

373
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,887
but she got her creativity from <i>moi.</i>

374
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,932
Matching lipstick
to lip liner isn't creativity.

375
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,893
And, while I may
not be father of the year...

376
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:29,353
Oh, try the past two decades.

377
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:32,648
I recently took a bullet for our daughter.
Not metaphorically, either.

378
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:35,484
-By the way, a metaphor, it's a...
-Oh, I know what a metaphor means,

379
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,569
just like I know what abandoning
your family looks like.

380
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:40,656
Really? Because I remember
not having much of a choice in the matter.

Who is this guy, again?

389
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:05,681
Cooper Seldon, her ex-boyfriend.
How could I forget?

390
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,599
I thought he was dead,
and he just came back evil.

391

Oliver, Dr. Palmer, this guy.

How did you know?

Just because I wasn't in your life

402

doesn't mean
I wasn't keeping tabs on my daughter.

00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,539
You sound like
there's a "but" to that sentence.

627
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:11,126
People still need saving.

628
00:36:11,877 --> 00:36:13,128
They still need hope.

629
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,174
Give it back!

630
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:20,178
Taiana, if you want it back,
you're going to have to kill me.

631
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,554
And I'm betting you won't.

632
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,181
And what about me, Mr. Queen?

633
00:36:24,014 --> 00:36:26,434
And after killing you,

634
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:27,768
I'll kill her.

635
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,036
Tell me.

636
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:49,081
It was Machin. He's...

637
00:36:49,164 --> 00:36:50,750
Ruvé?

638
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,044
I'm sorry.

639
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:58,383
My daughter?

640
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,219
We're still getting reports of survivors.

641
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:02,845
We're locked out of Rubicon.

642
00:37:02,928 --> 00:37:03,929
Momentarily.

643
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:06,516
I know someone who can get us back online.

644
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:07,975
Damien...

645
00:37:08,058 --> 00:37:10,561
Tevat Noah is gone.
It's buried under miles of ash.

646
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:14,524
Even if you could
regain control of Rubicon,

647
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:17,443
there'd be no place on Earth that is safe.

648
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:25,034
If there's no place left on Earth
that's safe,

649
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:28,746
let it all burn.

650
00:37:39,089 --> 00:37:40,174
All right, I'm listening.

651
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,509
Though, if you could
keep the lecture short...

652
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,218
-No lecture.
-I'd appreciate it.

653
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,430
-Just a request.
-Uh-huh.

654
00:37:48,933 --> 00:37:51,226
Leave, and this time,

655
00:37:52,227 --> 00:37:53,479
don't come back.

656
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,230
-What?
-You helped Felicity tonight.

657
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:56,982
Maybe it was because you'd be nuked, too.

658
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,901
Maybe it was a broken clock
being right for once.

659
00:37:58,984 --> 00:38:01,696
Either way, we both know it wasn't you.

660
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:05,199
-Dee...
-You know who you are.

661
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,955
Are you really going to stand here

662
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,164
(CHUCKLES)

663
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,792
and tell me that you've changed?

664
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:21,215
You're every bit as dangerous
to our daughter

665
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,967
as the day I took her from you.

666
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,097
If you care about her,

667
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:30,975
you will walk away.

668
00:38:31,642 --> 00:38:34,144
After everything that's happened,
she'll be crushed.

669
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,063
She'll survive.

670
00:38:36,146 --> 00:38:38,566
She's strong. She's my daughter.

671
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:45,656
You can lie to her,
but can you lie to yourself?

672
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:52,830
Can you really believe
that leaving isn't the best thing for her?

673
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:55,958
CURTIS: <i>What do you think
your parents are talking about?</i>

674
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,918
FELICITY: I'm trying
not to think about it.

675
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,921
Maybe they're discussing that thing
that Noah said before

676
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:02,923
about not having much of a choice.

677
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:04,509
That's exactly what
I'm trying not to think about.

678
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,594
-Felicity, I helped you save the world.
-Mmm-hmm?

679
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,429
The least you can do
is give me a little gossip.

680
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,139
Okay, fine.

681
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:13,142
So, apparently...

682
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:15,770
My dad didn't leave.
My mom kicked him out.

683
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:17,605
Did she tell you why?

684
00:39:18,188 --> 00:39:20,566
I think she didn't want
to risk him hurting me.

685
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,443
I mean, he could promise
whatever he wanted,

686
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:25,780
but he was a criminal, is a criminal.

687
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:29,575
So, he inevitably would have
gone back to his old habits.

688
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:30,868
Mmm-hmm.

689
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:33,579
What does that mean?

690
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,373
It just sounds familiar, that's all.

691
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,626
The criminal
who you don't think can change,

692
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:42,797
the slightly overactive
but understandable breakup.

693
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,048
Just saying.

694
00:39:44,131 --> 00:39:45,633
You and Oliver,

695
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:46,717
Donna and Noah.

696
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,970
(DOOR OPENS)

697
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:52,807
Where is Noah?

698
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:55,518
He's going away for a little while.

699
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,603
That's what you told me when I was seven.

700
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,940
DARHK: Boo-hoo!

701
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:05,486
Are you getting all weepy?

702
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:06,571
Do you need a moment?

703
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:08,656
No? Good.

704
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:10,157
'Cause I need you to do me a favor.

705
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:11,909
Go to hell.

706
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:13,243
(DARHK EXHALES DEEPLY)

707
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:15,287
Why bother?

708
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:17,498
I'm going to bring it to us.
