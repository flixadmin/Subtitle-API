1
00:00:43,143 --> 00:00:45,543
Those old-time movies were the best.

2
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,674
Bogart, Gable, Tracy.

3
00:00:48,848 --> 00:00:50,679
They don't make them like that anymore.

4
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,580
- Remember our first date?
- Like it was yesterday.

5
00:00:53,753 --> 00:00:55,744
Went to the Fox Theatre,
San Francisco...

6
00:00:55,922 --> 00:00:58,049
...saw a movie with Ronald Colman.

7
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:01,387
The Embassy Theatre.
And it was Errol Flynn.

8
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:04,359
- You sure?
- Pretty sure.

9
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:06,260
Of course, it was a long time ago.

10
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:09,925
Well, all I remember is I couldn't
take my eyes off you.

11
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:12,094
I still can't.

12
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:14,664
What's that?

13
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,480
- What is it?
- I don't know.

14
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:28,482
Looks like a broken piece of jewelry.

15
00:01:28,655 --> 00:01:31,283
Well, why would someone
leave it here for you?

16
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:33,119
Who knows.

17
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:59,344
My God. I know what this is.

18
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:35,241
Everybody, can you just stand back,
away from the debris, please?

19
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,649
Yeah. Sir, can you help me
with this over here?

20
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:46,456
Yeah. I have to move everybody back,
out of the way.

21
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,753
Sir, could you step over here, please?

22
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:58,561
Please, stay back, people.
Please stay behind...

23
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,707
Too bad about Judge Foster.

24
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:03,671
- Yeah.
- He was a cool dude.

25
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:07,472
My dad used to always say he was
one of the fairest judges in Central City.

26
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:09,342
They used to play poker together.

27
00:04:09,515 --> 00:04:13,076
Well, someone dealt him
a lousy hand tonight.

28
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:17,589
- What happened here?
- I don't know, man. I just got here myself.

29
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:22,289
But the coroner's assistant
found this in his hand.

30
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:25,226
It looks like some part
of a medallion.

31
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:26,990
Allen. Mendez.

32
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:30,658
What are you waiting for,
an engraved invitation? Get to work.

33
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,635
Garfield, you sweet-talker.

34
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:38,204
Anything?

35
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:41,777
Here you go.

36
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:46,482
- What is it?
- Residue of plastic explosives.

37
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,280
I knew this wasn't an accident.

38
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:54,120
Whoever did this knew exactly how much
explosives to use and where to put them.

39
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,318
Barry.

40
00:04:56,496 --> 00:05:00,660
Looks like I found the detonator cap,
but I don't recognize the make.

41
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:06,433
You know, lieutenant, if I were you,
I'd check through Foster's old case logs.

42
00:05:06,606 --> 00:05:09,404
Look for somebody he put away
who got out of jail recently.

43
00:05:09,575 --> 00:05:12,339
Also, I'd look for someone
with experience using explosives.

44
00:05:12,512 --> 00:05:15,640
Yeah, like a cat who worked construction
or did time with Uncle Sam.

45
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,045
Now, why didn't I think of that?

46
00:05:18,217 --> 00:05:22,881
It's a good thing I got you two geniuses
around to do my job for me.

47
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:27,787
Hey, what's this?

48
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:33,632
Looks like an engagement ring.

49
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,766
Marriage?

50
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:39,934
Anyone we know, sir?

51
00:05:40,106 --> 00:05:43,007
- Look, there's an M inscribed in it.
- Margaret?

52
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,768
- Mary.
- Mabel.

53
00:05:45,278 --> 00:05:47,678
- Mavis.
- You two guys are cute.

54
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,474
Thank you, sir.

55
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:53,050
You're sure you're really ready for this?
It's an awfully big step, sir.

56
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:56,120
You've only been dating for three years.
You hardly know her.

57
00:05:56,289 --> 00:06:00,055
Why don't you two clowns go back
to the lab and blow yourselves up.

58
00:06:03,262 --> 00:06:07,665
- So you think he'll really pop the question?
- Oh, I think he's just gonna pop.

59
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,891
Warren, you scared the daylights
out of me.

60
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,165
- You hungry?
- That depends.

61
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,362
I'll make you a salad.
Seaweed and kelp.

62
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:51,033
If I want something from the ocean,
I'll eat a fish stick. How about some water?

63
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,905
Tap water, right?

64
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,707
You know, bottled water
doesn't have any soul.

65
00:06:57,116 --> 00:06:58,947
All right.

66
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:00,779
Confess, Warren.

67
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:02,887
What did you have for breakfast?

68
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:04,852
A dozen eggs.

69
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:07,686
Bacon. Raw.

70
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:11,193
You can joke all you like,
I'm just looking after your heart.

71
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:13,298
- Yeah, I know you are.
- What's this?

72
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:23,098
Oh, my God.

73
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:27,207
- You're crazy.
- Why?

74
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:31,478
We can't get married.
We'd drive each other crazy.

75
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:33,243
That's what married people do.

76
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:36,855
- You're really serious.
- Look...

77
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,924
I'm not very good with words.

78
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,596
I've been alone almost all my life.
All I know is being a cop. It's all I got.

79
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:49,234
I want somebody to come home to.

80
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:51,669
Me too.

81
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:53,965
Oh, you're the best, Mavis.

82
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:58,036
You got a good heart, terrific smile.

83
00:07:58,277 --> 00:07:59,904
So, what do you say?

84
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:02,471
Wanna get married?

85
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,247
Sure, why not.

86
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:18,620
One thing, though.
When we get married, I do the cooking.

87
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:26,800
Mendez. I've been looking for you.

88
00:08:26,973 --> 00:08:31,433
- You guys finish that forensics report yet?
- Well, actually we're still working...

89
00:08:31,611 --> 00:08:33,841
No problem.
I know you guys are working hard.

90
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,982
- Just let me know when it's ready.
- Yes, sir.

91
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:39,879
- That's a nice shirt.
- Thanks.

92
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:50,755
She must've said yes.

93
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,703
Damn. Broken again?

94
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:09,807
Fine.

95
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,610
I'll do it myself.

96
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,991
Not bad, Allen.

97
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:33,901
I gotta get my eyes checked, man.
Things keep blurring on me.

98
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:38,966
I tested the residue from that explosive
from the theater.

99
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:41,670
Its chemicals are different
from anything available.

100
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:44,782
Well, that detonator cap we found
is made out of titanium.

101
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:48,717
So we have a custom cap to match
your designer explosives.

102
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:52,048
That means we have to talk
to a specialist.

103
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:54,317
What about that guy
from the survivalist shop?

104
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:56,961
You know, the one we busted
for concealing a weapon?

105
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,460
- Callahan?
- Yeah.

106
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:00,690
The man who sleeps with a grenade
under his pillow?

107
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,228
- I think I'll pay Mr. Callahan a little visit.
- Well, good luck.

108
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:07,167
I asked him some questions
about the dock arson cases.

109
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,001
He stonewalled me the whole time.

110
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:12,906
Look, if you ask me, his clip is short
a few bullets. Catch my drift?

111
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,070
Yeah. I think I can handle him.

112
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:25,414
Well, like I said, this is just
a facsimile of the real thing.

113
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:28,185
But if you're interested...

114
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:31,819
...for another $20, this book will teach you
to convert that...

115
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:35,195
...into an actual operating
rocket launcher.

116
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,495
Of course, that's illegal.

117
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:42,471
But you know what I always say:
"If it ain't illegal, it ain't fun."

118
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,534
There you go.

119
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:49,203
- See you.
- You enjoy.

120
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,852
- What the hell?
- Hello, Callahan.

121
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,897
I know who you are.

122
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:09,831
You're The Flash.
I'm a big fan of yours.

123
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,799
I get something for you?

124
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,098
Look, how about this?

125
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:18,539
M-60. You can wipe out a whole streetload
of those homeless people with this.

126
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,406
You make me sick, Callahan.

127
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,706
Oh, come on.

128
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:25,976
- We believe in the same things.
- Not even close!

129
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,643
Just touching you makes my skin crawl.

130
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:31,954
All right, then what do you want?

131
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:33,614
Information.

132
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,385
On what?

133
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:59,243
Didn't anyone ever tell you
it's illegal to sell these?

134
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:03,747
Hey.

135
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,668
I'll never be able to put those
back together.

136
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,778
That's the idea.

137
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:33,875
- Did you make this?
- No.

138
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:35,782
But you know who did.

139
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,352
Tell me!

140
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:41,584
You wanna kill me, go ahead.

141
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:46,323
Because if I tell you anything, I'm signing
my own death warrant. So go ahead.

142
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,910
The minute I pulled out
that detonator cap, this guy...

143
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:15,152
I mean, he was really ready
to let me kill him before he'd talk.

144
00:13:15,327 --> 00:13:18,387
All right? Now, what would
inspire fear like that?

145
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,191
I haven't the faintest idea.

146
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:24,598
Another weird thing. You know, I tried
to access Callahan's police file. No dice.

147
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,261
Restricted for security reasons.

148
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,464
Now, figure that out.

149
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,007
What do you think?

150
00:13:31,177 --> 00:13:34,169
I think we agreed not to discuss
police business tonight.

151
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:36,906
- Remember?
- I agreed to that?

152
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,250
Is your name Barry?

153
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,943
All right, all right, all right.

154
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:45,616
So, what's the occasion?

155
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,759
I did want to talk to you
about something.

156
00:13:51,063 --> 00:13:54,032
I've been offered a position
at another research institute.

157
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:55,932
Where?

158
00:13:56,569 --> 00:14:01,734
It's the Pacific Institute of Technology
in California.

159
00:14:01,907 --> 00:14:04,239
I've always dreamed of working there.

160
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:09,247
It sounds like quite an opportunity.

161
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:10,643
- Oh, it is.
- Oh, yeah.

162
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:12,909
I mean, you plan to accept?

163
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,916
I don't know.
I haven't really thought about it yet.

164
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:19,118
I see.

165
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:21,520
Well...

166
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:25,861
...what about you and me?
I mean, the experiment?

167
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,659
What'll happen to us...? That.

168
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:34,661
- Maybe I can fly back every few months.
- Every few months?

169
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,331
- Your metabolism, I mean.
- Oh, right. My metabolism.

170
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:41,275
Yeah, we certainly wouldn't wanna let
that get away from us, would we?

171
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:47,442
We have serious problems in this state.
Crime, poverty, troubled schools.

172
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,747
What are you gonna do
about that, Mr. Dejoy?

173
00:14:49,922 --> 00:14:52,220
Well, when I was a DA,
I had the reputation...

174
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:54,951
...for finding new solutions
to old problems.

175
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:58,824
If I'm elected senator,
you can expect the same thing.

176
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:02,666
You're not writing that down.

177
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,366
No need. It's all in your campaign fliers.

178
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,805
Okay. Okay.

179
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:12,705
Let's just say, I'll do my best and hope.

180
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:16,041
- To get lucky?
- To get lucky.

181
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:17,773
And let's leave it at that.

182
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:20,578
You've got that cocktail party
at the mayor's office.

183
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,517
Oh, that's right. Thank you, Jeff.
I'll meet you at the car.

184
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:25,782
And a messenger delivered this
to your office.

185
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,687
Thank you.

186
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:31,394
- Well, you'll have to excuse me.
- No problem.

187
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:33,656
Thank you for the interview.
And good luck.

188
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:35,265
Thank you.

189
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,872
Barry Allen.

190
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,778
Frank. How are you?

191
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,010
- Frank Dejoy, meet Christina McGee.
- Hello.

192
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:57,553
I knew Frank when he was in
the district attorney's office.

193
00:16:05,497 --> 00:16:06,725
Good seeing you, Barry.

194
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:10,993
Frank?

195
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:13,296
Oh, my God!

196
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:21,179
Get an ambulance!

197
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:24,405
It's too late.

198
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:25,982
He's already dead.

199
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,210
- Is he okay?
- Help.

200
00:17:32,184 --> 00:17:34,379
An ex-DA gets shot with an arrow...

201
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,750
...lands in the middle of your dinner plate,
and you took off?

202
00:17:37,923 --> 00:17:40,756
Where the hell were you
last night, Allen?

203
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:44,418
You were the only officer at the scene
of a crime, and you disappeared?

204
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:47,030
I was pursuing the killer, lieutenant.

205
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:50,794
The arrows were fired from the courthouse,
which is across the street, so...

206
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:53,665
You weren't there
when the black-and-whites arrived.

207
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,434
Sorry, sir.

208
00:17:56,608 --> 00:17:58,599
I rushed back to the lab.

209
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,169
I wasn't thinking very clearly.

210
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:04,338
You came back to the lab
after witnessing a homicide?

211
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:07,843
When Dejoy died,
he was clutching a metal fragment.

212
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,683
And it was exactly the same
as what we found in Judge Foster's hand.

213
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:14,849
I rushed back to the lab
to compare them, okay?

214
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:17,188
Now take a look. Take a look at this.

215
00:18:17,896 --> 00:18:19,420
They match up.

216
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:23,466
Together, they form part of
some kind of symbol.

217
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:27,032
So now the two killings are related.

218
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,470
All right. Nice work.

219
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:31,870
Thank you, sir.

220
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:33,978
Doesn't excuse what you did.

221
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:37,707
You ever leave a crime scene again,
I'm gonna have you on suspension.

222
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:39,748
Yes, sir.

223
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,484
Something wrong?

224
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:48,182
Oh, I twisted my back.

225
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,294
Allen.

226
00:18:51,697 --> 00:18:53,289
Where would you rather go:

227
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,296
Atlantic City...

228
00:18:55,901 --> 00:18:57,129
...or Las Vegas?

229
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,328
You and me, sir?

230
00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:02,736
I'm talking about my honey...

231
00:19:02,908 --> 00:19:04,136
Moon?

232
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:07,369
- Get out of here, Allen.
- Yes, sir.

233
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:11,182
- I can't believe he didn't suspend you.
- Yeah.

234
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,681
- You okay?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

235
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:15,479
- How did you hurt your back?
- I wasn't looking behind me.

236
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,122
- You should see a doctor.
- I think you're right.

237
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,850
- Could you cover for me for a couple hours?
- Sure.

238
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:23,824
Great. Start checking through
Judge Foster's old cases...

239
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,157
...the one Dejoy prosecuted
when he was DA.

240
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:30,028
- Lf there's a connection, it'll be there.
- That's gonna be a long list, man.

241
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:33,035
Narrow it down to someone
with a penchant for exotic killings.

242
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:35,765
- Like a hit man?
- No, it goes way behind that, Julio.

243
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,203
I don't know, look for...

244
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:39,241
- Something weird.
- Something weird.

245
00:19:39,411 --> 00:19:40,742
- Hey, Barry.
- Yeah?

246
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:44,405
You told Garfield you came back
to the lab last night, right?

247
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:47,677
Well, I was here last night,
and I didn't see you.

248
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,151
Must have just missed you.

249
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,690
So...

250
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,127
...will I live?

251
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,291
Unfortunately.

252
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:08,138
- Are you mad at me?
- No, I'm not mad at you.

253
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:10,235
I'm furious at you.

254
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:13,936
You disappeared, and I never saw you again.
For all I knew, you were dead.

255
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:16,740
Well, I was dazed by an electrical jolt.

256
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:19,247
Then I heard the police sirens,
so I took off.

257
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:22,285
Without bothering to call me
or let me know what happened.

258
00:20:22,454 --> 00:20:23,648
I'm here now, aren't I?

259
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:27,417
Because you want me to fix you, not
because you give a damn about my feelings.

260
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:30,619
- Barry, I was worried about you.
- Is that why you're moving?

261
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:33,321
I mean, our phone bills
are gonna be hell, right?

262
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,127
Is that what this is all about?

263
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:38,929
You don't want me to take the job.

264
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:42,164
- I didn't say that.
- Yes, that's right, you didn't.

265
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:43,831
You didn't say anything.

266
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:46,443
Barry, if you don't want me to go,
tell me.

267
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:49,009
Well, I...

268
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:50,705
...don't...

269
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:52,179
...know. I don't...

270
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:55,081
Look, you wanna go to California,
you go to California.

271
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,279
All right? It's your choice.

272
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,217
Fine.

273
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,090
I've gotta go to work.

274
00:21:19,177 --> 00:21:23,136
Now let's access all known symbols
in the departmental files.

275
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:43,862
Nope.

276
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:46,561
Julio, why don't you go
get us a cup of coffee.

277
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,296
Sure.

278
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:36,143
What?

279
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:38,619
Could you feel my head?

280
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:42,125
- What?
- Will you feel my head, please?

281
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,854
- I don't wanna feel your head.
- Feel my head.

282
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,227
- I don't wanna feel your head.
- It's easy. Just like this.

283
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:50,898
Is it warm?

284
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:52,661
Why?

285
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:56,731
Because I could've swore that...

286
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:00,667
I just saw you working...

287
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:03,212
...so fast that I couldn't see your hand.

288
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,510
Yeah, you know, it does feel
a little warm to me.

289
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:10,781
I hope you're not getting sick, man.
We got a lot of work to do.

290
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:16,587
That's it.

291
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:18,286
That's it. That's our answer.

292
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:22,259
- "The Warriors of Freedom."
- The what?

293
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:24,402
You ever hear of Jefferson Zacharias?

294
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,461
Sounds a little familiar.

295
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:31,601
Rasputin have a grandson?

296
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:35,076
Zacharias led a survivalist commune
in the wilderness 10 years ago.

297
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:40,511
It's a bunch of neo-fascists. Assassination
squads, terror units, the works.

298
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:43,245
They called themselves
"The Warriors of Freedom."

299
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,289
Freedom. Yeah, they wanted
to start their own country.

300
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,255
With an army funded by bank robberies.

301
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:52,523
- Wasn't there a big shootout in the woods?
- Yeah. Most of the Warriors were killed.

302
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:56,064
Zacharias was arrested,
but not before he blew away a few cops.

303
00:23:56,234 --> 00:23:58,361
I remember there was a big trial.

304
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:02,931
And there's your connection, right there.

305
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,941
Foster was the judge,
and Dejoy, the prosecuting attorney.

306
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,909
Zacharias is out of prison,
and he wants to settle the score.

307
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,640
No, man, he was sentenced to death.

308
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,677
But I remember
on the day he was executed...

309
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:17,344
...it was in all the papers, he swore...

310
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:20,218
...that he would send
an angel of death...

311
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,656
...to kill everyone responsible.

312
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,691
Oh, my God.

313
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:33,969
Where would Garfield be?

314
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,869
He's off duty, right?
Probably at the diner with Mavis.

315
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:39,101
Call the duty sergeant,
have him send a car.

316
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:40,642
Right.

317
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:44,844
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Sarge, it's Mendez.

318
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:48,417
Look, we gotta find
Lieutenant Garfield right away, man.

319
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:51,883
<i>Hello?</i>

320
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:53,747
<i>Hello?</i>

321
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:56,587
<i>Who is this?</i>
<i>You're gonna be in big trouble.</i>

322
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,430
I always kind of wanted to go to Paris
on my honeymoon.

323
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:06,002
I hate French food.

324
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,264
Don't you have any sense of romance?

325
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,342
- What's more romantic than Atlantic City?
- This is never gonna work.

326
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,844
We must have been kidding ourselves,
thinking we could get married.

327
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:19,450
- Are you saying you wanna call it off?
- Maybe we should.

328
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:21,415
- All right, then, fine.
- Terrific.

329
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:23,577
Wonderful.

330
00:25:28,093 --> 00:25:29,993
This is gonna be some marriage.

331
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:32,061
It sure is.

332
00:25:40,805 --> 00:25:42,397
Warren?

333
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:46,172
There's this for you.

334
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:52,845
What's that red dot?

335
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,947
- It's gone.
- No.

336
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:01,786
No. No. Mavis!

337
00:26:16,107 --> 00:26:17,699
Help!

338
00:26:18,877 --> 00:26:21,345
Police! Call the police!

339
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:30,249
No, no, no!

340
00:26:35,026 --> 00:26:39,963
I'll be at the hospital in a couple of minutes.
You guys take good care of her, you hear?

341
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:43,032
Hurry up. Hurry up, now. Hurry up.

342
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:45,533
Johnson, keep those people back, please.

343
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:56,572
- Allen.
- Yes, sir?

344
00:26:57,816 --> 00:26:59,044
What do you got?

345
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:02,584
The gunman was positioned on the roof.
He left his weapon behind.

346
00:27:02,754 --> 00:27:04,881
Custom-made, no serial numbers.

347
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:07,251
What about this Flash character?

348
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:08,892
Nobody saw him but you, sir.

349
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,893
No, I'm telling you, he was here.
He saved my life.

350
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:13,629
I believe you.

351
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:15,594
This is all my fault.

352
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:16,995
It's not your fault.

353
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:19,568
I should've recognized
the symbol on those pieces.

354
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:23,572
- Sir, it was 10 years ago.
- You tell that to Mavis.

355
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:27,867
- What's Jack Callahan's connection to this?
- Who?

356
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:32,005
Jack Callahan.
He runs a survivalist shop in Helltown.

357
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,915
Where did you get that name?

358
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,582
It came up in my investigation.

359
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:41,214
I tried to access his police record,
but it's restricted.

360
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:44,487
You stay away from Callahan,
and that is an order.

361
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,961
If Callahan's involved,
I need to know how.

362
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:50,101
He's not involved. At least not anymore.

363
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:53,834
What is that supposed to mean?
And why are you covering up for him?

364
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,342
- What?
- All right, get them back. Get them back!

365
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:02,707
Excuse me. One question.

366
00:28:02,881 --> 00:28:05,509
All right, damn you.
I am not covering up for anybody.

367
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:09,245
Well, would you please tell me
what the hell is going on here? Sir.

368
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:12,481
I mean, we're supposed to be
on the same team, right?

369
00:28:12,657 --> 00:28:15,285
- This doesn't go beyond here, understood?
- Yes, sir.

370
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:19,294
Callahan's record was sealed because
he was an informant inside the Warriors.

371
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:22,331
- An informer?
- He helped set up Zacharias.

372
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,025
The agreement was he wouldn't be
involved in the trial.

373
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,763
He was terrified that Zacharias' people
would kill him!

374
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,266
Now...

375
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:33,707
...you and Mendez give this case priority.

376
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:37,473
The minute you get anything,
you contact me and nobody else.

377
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:40,812
Lieutenant,
department regulations stipulate...

378
00:28:40,985 --> 00:28:44,045
...we're not to work cases
we're personally involved with.

379
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,383
I'm on this till the chief
tells me different.

380
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,487
- I know how you feel.
- No, you don't.

381
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:50,889
Yes, I do.

382
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:54,225
Now, we'll catch who did this,
and we'll bring him in.

383
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,630
You do your job, Allen,
and stay out of my way.

384
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:15,611
- How's he taking it?
- Not well, Julio. Not well at all.

385
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:18,756
Can you finish up things?
I've gotta go down to Helltown.

386
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,720
At this time of night? What for?

387
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:23,053
I gotta see a man about a gun.

388
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:43,404
Going somewhere, Callahan?

389
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,010
Angel, hi.

390
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:49,085
No, I was just moving my cash
to a safer place.

391
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:51,779
Never tell when the IRS might drop by.

392
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,316
You look nervous.

393
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,361
- Is anything wrong?
- No, everything's fine.

394
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:06,593
I heard The Flash paid you a visit
the other day.

395
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,972
- Was asking a lot of questions.
- I didn't tell him anything.

396
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,804
- Tony and Jay were here. Ask them.
- Did I say you did?

397
00:30:15,213 --> 00:30:16,646
But if you didn't...

398
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:20,842
...then how come The Flash showed up
right before I shot that cop's girlfriend?!

399
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:24,716
Look, Angel, your father was my friend.

400
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:27,221
I would never do anything to betray you.

401
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:33,287
Well, I guess I'm just being paranoid.

402
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,858
Sure, it's the times.

403
00:30:37,035 --> 00:30:39,560
I mean, these days,
who can you trust, huh?

404
00:30:40,305 --> 00:30:42,671
I'm beginning to wonder.

405
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:49,778
You know, your father tried to tell people.
They wouldn't listen.

406
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:52,007
So they crucified him.

407
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:54,980
God, he was a great man.

408
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,379
Yeah, he was always bigger than life.

409
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:01,192
Sometimes, it's like...

410
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:05,962
...without my father...

411
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:08,429
...I don't know who I am.

412
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,836
Oh, Angel, I think he'd be
proud of you.

413
00:31:13,304 --> 00:31:16,705
Whoever it was that betrayed your father,
they deserve to die.

414
00:31:18,743 --> 00:31:20,370
You're right.

415
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,019
Callahan.

416
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:35,687
Yeah?

417
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:39,622
I need more plastic explosives.

418
00:31:41,766 --> 00:31:43,734
Oh, sure.

419
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:47,233
I'll get some.

420
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,843
Here you go.

421
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:56,880
These should do it, huh?

422
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:01,980
So after we get this cop,
everything's finished then, huh?

423
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:04,121
Not quite.

424
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:07,423
There's still one more.

425
00:32:08,726 --> 00:32:10,193
The man...

426
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:14,229
...who betrayed my father
to the police.

427
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:19,063
Angel.

428
00:32:33,551 --> 00:32:36,850
I never said this very well before...

429
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:41,255
...but I love you, babe.

430
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:44,952
You understand?

431
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:52,799
It's because of me this happened.

432
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,974
I'm gonna make it right.

433
00:33:35,246 --> 00:33:37,214
Who did this?

434
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:39,546
Angel.

435
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,084
Angel.

436
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:06,534
- Crime Lab.
- <i>It's me. Call the coroner.</i>

437
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,975
- <i>The killer got here first.</i>
- Callahan?

438
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:13,174
<i>Yeah. Look, I need members list</i>
<i>of the Warriors for Freedom.</i>

439
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:16,878
<i>We're looking for someone named Angel,</i>
<i>as in "avenging angel."</i>

440
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,818
Oh, man.

441
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:22,282
Zacharias had a daughter.
Her name was Angel.

442
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,519
- <i>What?</i>
- Yeah, man. It's in the files.

443
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:26,560
She was a teenager
when he was executed.

444
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:29,131
<i>Print out her file. I'm on my way.</i>

445
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:37,533
So that's what you look like.

446
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:43,174
- Lieutenant.
- This is the killer, huh?

447
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:45,238
Nice work.

448
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,240
Barry.

449
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,303
A fax came in.

450
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:15,241
- Where you been?
- Oh, out running around.

451
00:35:15,413 --> 00:35:17,847
Okay, this is what we got
on Angel Zacharias.

452
00:35:18,015 --> 00:35:20,347
She grew up on
her father's paramilitary world.

453
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:24,113
Her parents got divorced when she was 13.
Her mom got custody.

454
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,121
The day after her dad was executed,
she ran away from home.

455
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:30,852
- It says here she joined the military at 18.
- Discharged a month ago.

456
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:34,555
- Last known address in Helltown.
- Garfield probably arrested her by now.

457
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:37,758
- What?
- He got her address about 15 minutes ago.

458
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:39,627
Man, he didn't go to arrest her.

459
00:35:40,204 --> 00:35:42,172
He went to kill her.

460
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:25,077
<i>Hold it. You're standing on</i>
<i>a pressure-sensitive plate...</i>

461
00:36:25,249 --> 00:36:28,446
<i>... connected to over 50 pounds</i>
<i>of plastic explosives.</i>

462
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:32,749
<i>And if you try to step off the plate,</i>
<i>the explosives will go off instantly.</i>

463
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:38,885
<i>However, you've also activated a timer</i>
<i>set to detonate in 60 seconds anyway.</i>

464
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:41,088
<i>I'm glad you weren't killed in the diner.</i>

465
00:36:41,265 --> 00:36:44,792
<i>This is much better.</i>
<i>You're the one who arrested my father.</i>

466
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:48,530
<i>More than anyone else,</i>
<i>you're responsible for his death.</i>

467
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,230
<i>And another thing...</i>

468
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:55,474
<i>... since you took away someone I love,</i>
<i>I'm going to do the same thing to you.</i>

469
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:59,548
<i>In fact, right now I'm on my way</i>
<i>to kill your girlfriend.</i>

470
00:37:00,117 --> 00:37:03,416
<i>But there's absolutely nothing</i>
<i>you can do about it.</i>

471
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:08,347
<i>Think about that while you wait to die.</i>

472
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:31,915
You.

473
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:35,645
A pressure plate and a timer.

474
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,119
- You're in trouble.
- Forget about me.

475
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:42,817
She's going to kill my girlfriend.
Room 808, County Hospital.

476
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:47,727
And if I try to disarm it,
it goes off anyway. Nice.

477
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:50,492
You hear me? I said get out of here!

478
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:55,237
- Get out of here.
- Are you crazy? Get out of here.

479
00:37:55,406 --> 00:37:57,237
- Go!
- You're faster than I am.

480
00:37:57,408 --> 00:37:59,069
There's only a few seconds left.

481
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,679
You wanna die? Fine.

482
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:18,058
This is gonna be close.

483
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:35,571
Visiting hours are over.

484
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:05,301
Garfield, no.

485
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:02,485
Angel.

486
00:41:12,069 --> 00:41:13,627
Three strikes, you're out.

487
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:17,205
- Give up, Angel. It's over.
- You're damn straight it is.

488
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,749
- Don't.
- You stay out of this.

489
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:30,887
You're a cop.

490
00:41:31,055 --> 00:41:32,545
Yeah? Yeah?

491
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:34,623
Then I resign.

492
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:40,319
- You have no right to kill her.
- She murdered four people.

493
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:44,059
- And she tried to kill Mavis.
- You killed my father!

494
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:46,430
I arrested him after he shot two cops.

495
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:51,337
I was only 15 years old
when you executed him!

496
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:54,009
Go ahead.

497
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,146
Kill me.

498
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:58,713
I'm dead inside, anyhow!

499
00:41:58,883 --> 00:42:00,544
Look at her.

500
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:04,176
She's eaten up by hatred.
Is that what you wanna become?

501
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:11,126
Damn you.

502
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,188
- Nice wedding.
- Yeah.

503
00:42:40,658 --> 00:42:41,989
Listen...

504
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:47,222
...l've been thinking about that job offer
of yours in California.

505
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,025
And?

506
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:51,190
Well, l...

507
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:55,097
It's very far away, you know.
And I'm fast, all right...

508
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:57,763
...but suppose I have an emergency?

509
00:42:57,942 --> 00:43:01,571
I'm sure we can find another metabolic
specialist at the lab who can help you...

510
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:03,406
Look, I'd miss you.

511
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:05,481
So don't go, all right?

512
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:08,418
Say "please."

513
00:43:08,886 --> 00:43:10,786
Don't push it, McGee.

514
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:12,252
Okay.

515
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,551
Actually, I've already turned
the offer down.

516
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:18,290
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

517
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:20,089
Take a picture. Take a picture.

518
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,198
Yeah. All right.

519
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:28,604
- Bye-bye. Congratulations.
- Good luck!

520
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:30,933
- Bye. Congratulations!
- Good luck.

521
00:43:32,843 --> 00:43:35,641
- Barry. Looking sharp, man.
- Thanks.

522
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:38,944
- I gotta talk to you for a minute.
- Yeah, sure.

523
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:41,141
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

524
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:46,218
I have to talk to you. So we've
been friends for a long time, right?

525
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:48,358
So we can be honest with each other.

526
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,726
Absolutely.

527
00:43:50,894 --> 00:43:55,354
Okay. Well, for the past couple of months,
you've been acting kind of different.

528
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:59,434
And at first I didn't know why,
but I think I figured it out.

529
00:43:59,603 --> 00:44:03,630
You see, it all started
when you got hit by lightning, right?

530
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:07,834
At the same time, The Flash started
showing up all over the place.

531
00:44:08,846 --> 00:44:12,111
- That's when I figured it out...
- Julio, look!

532
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:21,382
- Did you see that?
- Oh, yeah, man. I can't believe it.

533
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:25,050
- The Flash was...
- I guess he really exists.

534
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:33,528
What did you wanna
talk to me about?

535
00:44:35,706 --> 00:44:37,640
No, never mind.

536
00:44:37,808 --> 00:44:39,776
It's all right.

537
00:44:40,611 --> 00:44:42,738
- See you.
- Okay.

538
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,680
Take care, you understand
what I'm saying?

539
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,981
You son of a gun.
Get rid of that mustache.

540
00:44:53,624 --> 00:44:55,251
Dress codes, dress codes.

541
00:44:55,426 --> 00:44:58,327
- All right.
- Drive carefully.

542
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:01,430
- Bye!
- Have a good time.

543
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:09,128
Poor Julio. You think you convinced him?

544
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:10,637
Yeah.

545
00:45:10,808 --> 00:45:13,606
But listen, don't ever let me
do that again, all right?

546
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:16,678
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

547
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:19,338
I just need something to eat.

548
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:25,712
Would you excuse me a moment?

549
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:28,551
Barry. Save me a slice.

550
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:51,798
