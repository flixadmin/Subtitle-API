He's not from around here.

waiting for you back at your apartment.

341

Is there anything you can
tell us about the Tesseract

342
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:01,673
that we ought to know now?

Loki's gonna drag this out.

817
00:53:01,596 --> 00:53:05,099
So, Thor, what's his play?

818
00:53:05,266 --> 00:53:07,894
He has an army called the Chitauri.

819
00:53:08,061 --> 00:53:10,980
They're not of Asgard,
nor any world known.

820
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:13,524
He means to lead them
against your people.

821
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:15,318
They will win him the Earth,

822
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:17,236
in return, I suspect, for the Tesseract.

823
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:19,155
An army

824
00:53:19,322 --> 00:53:21,074
from outer space.

825
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,659
So, he's building another portal.

826
00:53:23,826 --> 00:53:25,119
That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.

827
00:53:25,203 --> 00:53:26,204
Selvig?

828
00:53:26,454 --> 00:53:28,873
- He's an astrophysicist.
- He's a friend.

829
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:31,209
Loki has him under some kind of spell,

830
00:53:31,292 --> 00:53:32,835
along with one of ours.

831
00:53:33,002 --> 00:53:34,670
I want to know why Loki let us take him.

832
00:53:34,754 --> 00:53:36,089
He's not leading an army from here.

833
00:53:36,255 --> 00:53:37,965
I don't think
we should be focusing on Loki.

834
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:40,009
That guy's brain is a bag full of cats.

835
00:53:40,093 --> 00:53:41,344
You could smell crazy on him.

836
00:53:41,594 --> 00:53:43,262
Have care how you speak.

837
00:53:43,888 --> 00:53:45,807
Loki is beyond reason,
but he is of Asgard.

838
00:53:46,307 --> 00:53:47,433
And he is my brother.

839
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:49,519
He killed 80 people in two days.

840
00:53:50,478 --> 00:53:51,479
He's adopted.

841
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:54,023
I think it's about the mechanics.

842
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:56,192
Iridium... What do they
need the iridium for?

843
00:53:56,317 --> 00:53:57,318
It's a stabilizing agent.

844
00:53:57,527 --> 00:53:58,861
I'm just saying, pick a weekend.

845
00:53:58,986 --> 00:54:00,530
I'll fly you to Portland.

846
00:54:00,696 --> 00:54:02,323
Keep love alive.

847
00:54:02,490 --> 00:54:04,409
It means the portal
won't collapse on itself

848
00:54:04,492 --> 00:54:06,411
like it did at S.H.I.E.L.D.

849
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:09,872
No hard feelings, Point Break.
You've got a mean swing.

850
00:54:10,039 --> 00:54:12,333
Also, it means the portal
can open as wide

851
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:15,002
and stay open as long, as Loki wants.

852
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:17,672
Raise the mizzenmast. Jib the topsails.

853
00:54:19,382 --> 00:54:20,591
That man is playing <i>Galaga.</i>

854
00:54:21,843 --> 00:54:25,221
He thought we wouldn't notice,
but we did.

855
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:28,391
How does Fury even see these?

856
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:29,517
He turns.

857
00:54:30,017 --> 00:54:31,686
Sounds exhausting.

858
00:54:32,687 --> 00:54:33,938
The rest of the raw materials,

859
00:54:34,105 --> 00:54:36,899
Agent Barton can get
his hands on pretty easily.

860
00:54:37,066 --> 00:54:38,526
The only major component
he still needs

861
00:54:38,693 --> 00:54:42,196
is a power source
of high-energy density.

862
00:54:42,363 --> 00:54:45,491
Something to kick-start the Cube.

863
00:54:45,867 --> 00:54:48,578
When did you become an expert
in thermonuclear astrophysics?

864
00:54:48,661 --> 00:54:49,745
Last night.

865
00:54:50,538 --> 00:54:53,749
The packet, Selvig's notes,
the extraction theory papers.

866
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:54,959
Am I the only one who did the reading?

867
00:54:55,126 --> 00:54:57,920
Does Loki need any particular
kind of power source?

868
00:54:58,087 --> 00:55:00,882
He would have to heat the Cube
to 120-million Kelvin

869
00:55:01,048 --> 00:55:02,550
just to break through
the Coulomb barrier.

870
00:55:02,717 --> 00:55:04,969
Unless Selvig has figured out
how to stabilize

871
00:55:05,136 --> 00:55:06,262
the quantum tunneling effect.

872
00:55:06,429 --> 00:55:07,638
BANNER: Well, if he could do that,

873
00:55:07,722 --> 00:55:10,224
he could achieve heavy ion fusion
at any reactor on the planet.

874
00:55:10,266 --> 00:55:12,727
Finally, someone who speaks English.

875
00:55:12,894 --> 00:55:14,770
Is that what just happened?

876
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:17,106
It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner.

877
00:55:17,273 --> 00:55:20,401
Your work on antielectron
collisions is unparalleled.

878
00:55:20,568 --> 00:55:22,403
And I'm a huge fan of the way
you lose control

879
00:55:22,570 --> 00:55:24,447
and turn into an enormous
green rage-monster.

880
00:55:26,157 --> 00:55:27,241
Thanks.

881
00:55:27,408 --> 00:55:29,911
Dr. Banner is only here
to track the Cube.

882
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:31,412
I was hoping you might join him.

883
00:55:31,579 --> 00:55:32,580
ROGERS:
I would start with that stick of his.

884
00:55:32,914 --> 00:55:33,915
It may be magical,

885
00:55:33,956 --> 00:55:35,416
but it works an awful lot
like a HYDRA weapon.

886
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:38,419
I don't know about that,
but it is powered by the Cube.

887
00:55:38,794 --> 00:55:40,546
And I would like to know
how Loki used it

888
00:55:40,755 --> 00:55:42,423
to turn two of the sharpest men I know

889
00:55:42,507 --> 00:55:44,258
into his personal flying monkeys.

890
00:55:44,634 --> 00:55:46,135
Monkeys? I do not understand.

891
00:55:46,385 --> 00:55:47,220
I do.

892
00:55:50,306 --> 00:55:51,933
I understood that reference.

893
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,477
Shall we play, Doctor?

894
00:55:54,644 --> 00:55:56,270
This way, sir.

895
00:56:10,368 --> 00:56:11,953
The gamma readings
are definitely consistent

896
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:13,913
with Selvig's reports of the Tesseract.

897
00:56:14,539 --> 00:56:16,207
But it's going to take weeks to process.

898
00:56:16,374 --> 00:56:17,625
If we bypass their mainframe

899
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:19,001
and direct route to the Homer cluster,

900
00:56:19,168 --> 00:56:22,296
we can clock this
at around 600 teraflops.

901
00:56:23,464 --> 00:56:25,466
All I packed was a toothbrush.

902
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:28,135
You know, you should come by
Stark Tower sometime.

903
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:30,304
Top ten floors, all R&D.

904
00:56:30,638 --> 00:56:32,139
You'd love it. It's Candy Land.

905
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:34,892
Thanks, but the last time
I was in New York,

906
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:37,645
I kind of broke Harlem.

907
00:56:37,812 --> 00:56:39,647
Well, I promise
a stress-free environment.

908
00:56:39,814 --> 00:56:41,649
No tension, no surprises.

909
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:43,067
- (ELECTRIC DISCHARGE)
- Ow!

910
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:44,569
- ROGERS: Hey!
- Nothing?

911
00:56:44,694 --> 00:56:45,736
Are you nuts?

912
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:46,821
Jury's out.

913
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:48,281
You really have got
a lid on it, haven't you?

914
00:56:48,322 --> 00:56:49,323
What's your secret?

915
00:56:49,448 --> 00:56:50,908
Mellow jazz, bongo drums,
huge bag of weed?

916
00:56:50,992 --> 00:56:51,993
Is everything a joke to you?

917
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:53,452
Funny things are.

918
00:56:53,661 --> 00:56:55,454
Threatening the safety
of everyone on this ship

919
00:56:55,496 --> 00:56:56,831
isn't funny.

920
00:56:56,872 --> 00:56:57,873
No offense, Doc.

921
00:56:57,957 --> 00:56:59,584
It's all right,
I wouldn't have come aboard

922
00:56:59,667 --> 00:57:02,545
if I couldn't handle pointy things.

923
00:57:02,628 --> 00:57:05,006
You're tip-toeing, big man.
You need to strut.

924
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:07,049
And you need to focus
on the problem, Mr. Stark.

925
00:57:07,133 --> 00:57:08,509
STARK: Do you think I'm not?

926
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:11,596
Why did Fury call us in?
Why now? Why not before?

927
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:13,389
What isn't he telling us?

928
00:57:13,472 --> 00:57:15,016
I can't do the equation unless
I have all the variables.

929
00:57:15,641 --> 00:57:16,976
You think Fury's hiding something?

930
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:20,521
He's a spy. Captain, he's "the" spy.

931
00:57:20,563 --> 00:57:22,398
His secrets have secrets.

932
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:24,025
It's bugging him, too. Isn't it?

933
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:25,067
Uh...

934
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:27,695
I just want to finish my work here, and...

935
00:57:28,362 --> 00:57:29,363
Doctor?

936
00:57:34,869 --> 00:57:37,330
"A warm light for all mankind."

937
00:57:37,371 --> 00:57:39,373
Loki's jab at Fury about the Cube.

938
00:57:39,582 --> 00:57:40,875
I heard it.

939
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:43,252
I think that was meant for you.

940
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:47,214
Even if Barton didn't
tell Loki about the tower,

941
00:57:47,256 --> 00:57:48,299
it was still all over the news.

942
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:50,468
The Stark Tower? That big, ugly

943
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:52,928
building in New York?

944
00:57:53,262 --> 00:57:57,058
It's powered by an arc reactor,
a self-sustaining energy source.

945
00:57:57,099 --> 00:57:59,602
That building will run itself
for, what, a year?

946
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:01,562
It's just the prototype.

947
00:58:01,604 --> 00:58:03,481
I'm kind of the only name
in clean energy right now.

948
00:58:03,898 --> 00:58:05,358
That's what he's getting at.

949
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:08,069
So, why didn't S.H.I.E.L.D. bring him in
on the Tesseract project?

950
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:10,071
What are they doing
in the energy business

951
00:58:10,112 --> 00:58:11,405
in the first place?

952
00:58:11,572 --> 00:58:14,575
I should probably look into that
once my decryption program

953
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,661
finishes breaking into all of
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secure files.

954
00:58:16,744 --> 00:58:17,745
I'm sorry. Did you say...

955
00:58:17,787 --> 00:58:19,914
Jarvis has been running it
since I hit the bridge.

956
00:58:20,247 --> 00:58:21,874
In a few hours,
I'll know every dirty secret

957
00:58:21,916 --> 00:58:23,167
S.H.I.E.L.D. has ever tried to hide.

958
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:24,251
Blueberry?

959
00:58:24,293 --> 00:58:26,045
Yet you're confused about why
they didn't want you around.

960
00:58:26,379 --> 00:58:29,006
An intelligence organization
that fears intelligence?

961
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:30,966
Historically, not awesome.

962
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:33,386
I think Loki's trying to wind us up.

963
00:58:33,427 --> 00:58:35,096
This is a man who means to start a war

964
00:58:35,137 --> 00:58:36,597
and if we don't stay focused,
he'll succeed.

965
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:40,393
We have orders.
We should follow them.

966
00:58:40,935 --> 00:58:42,770
Following's not really my style.

967
00:58:44,146 --> 00:58:46,607
And you're all about style, aren't you?

968
00:58:46,649 --> 00:58:47,775
Of the people in this room,

969
00:58:47,817 --> 00:58:49,485
which one is,
A, wearing a spangly outfit,

970
00:58:49,568 --> 00:58:50,736
and, B, not of use?

971
00:58:50,986 --> 00:58:55,116
Steve, tell me none of this
smells a little funky to you.

972
00:58:57,827 --> 00:58:58,911
Just find the Cube.

973
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:03,457
(AGENTS TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

974
00:59:11,799 --> 00:59:13,801
STARK: That's the guy
my dad never shut up about?

975
00:59:14,427 --> 00:59:16,554
I'm wondering if they shouldn't have
kept him on ice.

976
00:59:16,637 --> 00:59:17,972
Huh.

977
00:59:18,013 --> 00:59:19,807
The guy's not wrong about Loki.

978
00:59:19,849 --> 00:59:21,684
He does have the jump on us.

979
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:24,520
What he's got is an Acme dynamite kit.

980
00:59:24,603 --> 00:59:26,480
It's going to blow up in his face.

981
00:59:26,522 --> 00:59:28,649
And I'm going to be there when it does.

982
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:31,318
Yeah. I'll read all about it.

983
00:59:32,737 --> 00:59:34,572
Uh-huh. Or you'll be suiting up
with the rest of us.

984
00:59:34,655 --> 00:59:35,781
(CHUCKLES)

985
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:39,952
You see, I don't get a suit of armor.

986
00:59:39,994 --> 00:59:43,414
I'm exposed. Like a nerve.

987
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:44,999
It's a nightmare.

988
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:48,210
I've got a cluster of shrapnel
trying every second

989
00:59:48,294 --> 00:59:50,337
to crawl its way into my heart.

990
00:59:50,421 --> 00:59:52,506
This stops it.

991
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:54,759
This little circle of light,
it's part of me now,

992
00:59:56,135 --> 00:59:57,678
not just armor.

993
00:59:58,471 --> 01:00:00,765
It's a terrible privilege.

994
01:00:01,265 --> 01:00:03,517
- But you can control it.
- Because I learned how.

995
01:00:03,601 --> 01:00:04,602
It's different.

996
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:08,481
Hey, I read all about your accident.

997
01:00:08,522 --> 01:00:11,734
That much gamma exposure
should have killed you.

998
01:00:12,026 --> 01:00:14,528
So you're saying that the Hulk...

999
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:18,115
The other guy saved my life?

1000
01:00:18,616 --> 01:00:19,784
That's nice.

1001
01:00:20,826 --> 01:00:24,538
It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what?

1002
01:00:25,873 --> 01:00:27,708
I guess we'll find out.

1003
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:31,253
You may not enjoy that.

1004
01:00:31,337 --> 01:00:33,339
And you just might.

we moved Jane Foster.

01:01:35,901 --> 01:01:38,320
They've got an excellent
observatory in Tromsø.

1011
01:01:38,404 --> 01:01:41,991
She was asked to consult there
very suddenly yesterday.

1012
01:01:42,074 --> 01:01:45,911
Handsome fee, private plane,
very remote.

1013
01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:47,705
She'll be safe.

1014
01:01:47,913 --> 01:01:49,290
Thank you.

1015
01:01:51,083 --> 01:01:52,918
It's no accident, Loki taking Erik Selvig.

1016
01:01:54,128 --> 01:01:56,547
I dread what he plans for him
once he's done.

1017
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:57,798
Erik is a good man.

1018
01:01:57,882 --> 01:01:58,924
He talks about you a lot.

1019
01:02:00,968 --> 01:02:02,970
You changed his life.

1020
01:02:04,638 --> 01:02:06,599
You changed everything around here.

1021
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,809
They were better as they were.

1022
01:02:09,393 --> 01:02:11,520
We pretend on Asgard
that we're more advanced

1023
01:02:11,604 --> 01:02:15,357
but we come here,
battling like bilge snipe.

1024
01:02:15,441 --> 01:02:17,318
- Like what?
- Bilge snipe.

1025
01:02:17,401 --> 01:02:20,154
You know, huge, scaly, big antlers.

1026
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:23,073
- You don't have those?
- I don't think so.

1027
01:02:23,157 --> 01:02:25,075
Well, they are repulsive.

1028
01:02:26,327 --> 01:02:28,662
And they trample everything
in their path.

1029
01:02:36,295 --> 01:02:39,590
When I first came to Earth,
Loki's rage followed me here,

1030
01:02:39,757 --> 01:02:41,926
and your people paid the price.

1031
01:02:42,176 --> 01:02:44,011
And now, again.

1032
01:02:46,513 --> 01:02:49,016
In my youth, I courted war.

FURY: War hasn't started yet.

1034
01:02:53,896 --> 01:02:55,731
You think you could make Loki tell us

1035
01:02:55,814 --> 01:02:57,149
where the Tesseract is?

1036
01:02:57,191 --> 01:03:00,527
I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield.

1037
01:03:00,611 --> 01:03:05,366
It's not just power he craves,
it's vengeance, upon me.

1038
01:03:05,449 --> 01:03:07,284
There's no pain
would prise his need from him.

1039
01:03:08,661 --> 01:03:10,913
A lot of guys think that

1040
01:03:10,996 --> 01:03:12,247
until the pain starts.

1041
01:03:14,792 --> 01:03:16,335
What are you asking me to do?

1042
01:03:16,377 --> 01:03:19,880
I'm asking,
what are you prepared to do?

1043
01:03:20,047 --> 01:03:21,048
Loki is a prisoner.

1044
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:23,676
Then why do I feel like
he's the only person on this boat

1045
01:03:23,717 --> 01:03:25,094
that wants to be here?

1046
01:03:37,898 --> 01:03:41,068
There's not many people
who can sneak up on me.

1047
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:42,736
But you figured I'd come.

1048
01:03:43,487 --> 01:03:44,905
After.

1049
01:03:45,906 --> 01:03:49,410
After whatever tortures
Fury can concoct,

1050
01:03:49,493 --> 01:03:53,205
you would appear
as a friend, as a balm.

1051
01:03:54,081 --> 01:03:55,666
And I would cooperate.

1052
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:57,793
I want to know what
you've done to Agent Barton.

1053
01:03:58,043 --> 01:03:59,878
I would say I've expanded his mind.

1054
01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:04,591
And once you've won,

1055
01:04:05,092 --> 01:04:06,427
once you're king of the mountain,

1056
01:04:08,846 --> 01:04:11,265
what happens to his mind?

1057
01:04:11,306 --> 01:04:12,307
Oh...

1058
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:14,226
Is this love, Agent Romanoff?

1059
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:17,146
Love is for children. I owe him a debt.

1060
01:04:21,233 --> 01:04:22,943
Tell me.

1061
01:04:27,448 --> 01:04:30,743
Before I worked for S.H.I.E.L.D... I, uh...

1062
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:37,082
Well, I made a name for myself.

1063
01:04:37,124 --> 01:04:40,210
I have a very specific skill set.

1064
01:04:40,294 --> 01:04:43,714
I didn't care who I used it for, or on.

1065
01:04:44,965 --> 01:04:48,260
I got on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar
in a bad way.

1066
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:52,598
Agent Barton was sent to kill me.

1067
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:54,975
He made a different call.

1068
01:04:57,102 --> 01:04:59,980
And what will you do
if I vow to spare him?

1069
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:01,815
Not let you out.

1070
01:05:01,899 --> 01:05:03,817
No, but I like this.

1071
01:05:04,777 --> 01:05:08,030
Your world in the balance,
and you bargain for one man.

1072
01:05:08,322 --> 01:05:10,449
Regimes fall every day.

1073
01:05:10,491 --> 01:05:12,868
I tend not to weep over that.
I'm Russian.

1074
01:05:12,951 --> 01:05:13,994
Or I was.

1075
01:05:15,496 --> 01:05:16,997
And what are you now?

1076
01:05:17,623 --> 01:05:20,667
It's really not that complicated.

1077
01:05:20,709 --> 01:05:24,838
I got red in my ledger,
I'd like to wipe it out.

1078
01:05:25,798 --> 01:05:27,174
Can you?

1079
01:05:28,675 --> 01:05:32,513
Can you wipe out that much red?

1080
01:05:33,639 --> 01:05:35,182
Dreykov's daughter,

1081
01:05:36,850 --> 01:05:38,727
São Paulo,

1082
01:05:39,728 --> 01:05:42,064
the hospital fire?

1083
01:05:43,065 --> 01:05:45,484
Barton told me everything.

1084
01:05:45,526 --> 01:05:48,403
Your ledger is dripping. It's gushing red

1085
01:05:48,654 --> 01:05:51,365
and you think saving a man
no more virtuous than yourself

1086
01:05:51,406 --> 01:05:52,825
will change anything?

1087
01:05:52,866 --> 01:05:55,619
This is the basest sentimentality.

1088
01:05:55,702 --> 01:05:57,996
This is a child at prayer.

1089
01:05:58,038 --> 01:05:59,206

01:06:09,007 --> 01:06:12,052
<i>You pretend to be separate,
to have your own code,</i>

1093
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:15,055

1095
01:06:18,725 --> 01:06:22,312
<i>And they will never go away.</i>

1096
01:06:23,105 --> 01:06:26,650
I won't touch Barton,
not until I make him kill you.

1097
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:29,027
Slowly, intimately,

1098
01:06:29,069 --> 01:06:31,572
in every way he knows you fear.

1099
01:06:31,613 --> 01:06:34,449
And then he'll wake just long
enough to see his good work

1100
01:06:34,825 --> 01:06:38,328
and when he screams, I'll split his skull.

1101
01:06:38,495 --> 01:06:41,248
This is my bargain, you mewling quim.

You brought the monster.

1107

So, Banner.

1108
01:06:56,263 --> 01:06:57,431
That's your play.

What?

1110
01:06:59,683 --> 01:07:01,310
Loki means to unleash the Hulk.

1111
01:07:01,393 --> 01:07:02,936
Keep Banner in the lab. I'm on my way.

1112
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:04,104
Send Thor as well.

Thank you

1114
01:07:07,399 --> 01:07:09,610
for your cooperation.

1115
01:07:17,075 --> 01:07:18,577
What are you doing, Mr. Stark?

1116
01:07:18,619 --> 01:07:21,205
Uh, kind of been wondering
the same thing about you.

1117
01:07:21,622 --> 01:07:23,207
You're supposed to be locating
the Tesseract.

1118
01:07:23,290 --> 01:07:24,583
BANNER: We are. The model's locked

1119
01:07:24,791 --> 01:07:26,335
and we're sweeping
for the signature now.

1120
01:07:26,418 --> 01:07:27,711
When we get a hit,

1121
01:07:27,794 --> 01:07:29,296
we'll have the location
within half a mile.

1122
01:07:29,630 --> 01:07:33,926
Yeah, then you get your
Cube back. No muss, no fuss.

1123
01:07:33,967 --> 01:07:35,010
What is "Phase 2"?

1124
01:07:37,346 --> 01:07:40,224
Phase 2 is S.H.I.E.L.D. uses
the Cube to make weapons.

1125
01:07:40,307 --> 01:07:42,100
Sorry, computer was moving
a little slow for me.

1126
01:07:42,476 --> 01:07:44,937
Rogers, we gathered everything
related to the Tesseract.

1127
01:07:44,978 --> 01:07:46,313
This does not mean that we're making...

What were you lying?

1130
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:51,193
I was wrong, Director.

1131
01:07:51,318 --> 01:07:52,444
The world hasn't changed a bit.

1132
01:07:52,486 --> 01:07:53,487
Did you know about this?

1133
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:55,489
You want to think about
removing yourself

1134
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:56,698
from this environment, Doctor?

1135
01:07:56,782 --> 01:07:58,659
I was in Calcutta.
I was pretty well removed.

1136
01:07:58,951 --> 01:08:00,285
Loki is manipulating you.

1137
01:08:00,494 --> 01:08:01,870
And you've been doing what, exactly?

1138
01:08:01,954 --> 01:08:03,497
You didn't come here because
I bat my eyelashes at you.

1139
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:04,831
Yes, and I'm not leaving

1140
01:08:04,915 --> 01:08:06,291
because suddenly
you get a little twitchy.

1141
01:08:06,541 --> 01:08:08,210
I'd like to know why S.H.I.E.L.D.

1142
01:08:08,293 --> 01:08:11,922
is using the Tesseract
to build weapons of mass destruction.

1143
01:08:12,631 --> 01:08:13,799

1144
01:08:14,675 --> 01:08:15,676
Me?

1145
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:19,429
Last year, Earth had a visitor
from another planet

1146
01:08:19,513 --> 01:08:22,724
who had a grudge match
that leveled a small town.

1147
01:08:22,808 --> 01:08:24,935
We learned that
not only are we not alone

1148
01:08:25,143 --> 01:08:28,772
but we are hopelessly,
hilariously, outgunned.

1149

My people want nothing
but peace with your planet.

1150
01:08:31,191 --> 01:08:33,235
But you're not the only people
out there, are you?

1151
01:08:33,318 --> 01:08:35,195
And you're not the only threat.

1152
01:08:35,362 --> 01:08:38,365
The world's filling up with
people who can't be matched,

1153
01:08:39,032 --> 01:08:40,367
that can't be controlled.

1154
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,743
Like you controlled the Cube?

1155
01:08:41,827 --> 01:08:43,120
Your work with the Tesseract

1156
01:08:43,203 --> 01:08:45,831
is what drew Loki to it, and his allies.

1157
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:47,374
It is a signal to all the realms

1158
01:08:47,416 --> 01:08:50,127
that the Earth is ready
for a higher form of war.

1159
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:51,336
A higher form?

1160
01:08:51,378 --> 01:08:52,546
You forced our hand.

1161
01:08:52,587 --> 01:08:53,588
We had to come up with something.

1162
01:08:53,672 --> 01:08:54,715
A nuclear deterrent.

1163
01:08:54,756 --> 01:08:56,883
Because that always
calms everything right down.

1164
01:08:56,925 --> 01:08:59,386
Remind me again how
you made your fortune, Stark.

1165
01:08:59,428 --> 01:09:01,596
I'm sure if he still made weapons,
Stark would be neck-deep...

1166
01:09:01,888 --> 01:09:03,598
Hold on. How is this now about me?

1167
01:09:03,682 --> 01:09:04,850
I'm sorry, isn't everything?

1168
01:09:04,891 --> 01:09:06,893
I thought humans were
more evolved than this.

1169

your planet and blow stuff up?

1453
01:29:05,090 --> 01:29:06,759
<i>They called it.</i>

1454
01:29:22,983 --> 01:29:24,652
These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.

1455
01:29:27,988 --> 01:29:30,157
I guess he never did
get you to sign them.

1456
01:29:33,786 --> 01:29:35,496
We're dead in the air up here.

1457
01:29:35,579 --> 01:29:38,707
Our communications,
the location of the Cube,

1458
01:29:39,083 --> 01:29:41,252
Banner, Thor...

1459
01:29:42,711 --> 01:29:44,463
I got nothing for you.

1460
01:29:44,547 --> 01:29:47,466
I lost my one good eye.

1461
01:29:50,469 --> 01:29:53,430
Maybe I had that coming.

1462
01:29:57,726 --> 01:29:59,061
Yes,

1463
01:30:00,145 --> 01:30:03,566
we were going to build
an arsenal with the Tesseract.

1464
01:30:04,984 --> 01:30:06,944
I never put all my chips
on that number, though

1465
01:30:06,986 --> 01:30:10,114
because I was playing
something even riskier.

1466
01:30:13,993 --> 01:30:18,163
There was an idea, Stark knows this,

1467
01:30:19,999 --> 01:30:23,419
called the Avengers Initiative.

1468
01:30:24,587 --> 01:30:26,755
The idea was to bring together a group

1469
01:30:26,839 --> 01:30:29,425
of remarkable people

1470
01:30:30,175 --> 01:30:33,012
to see if they could become
something more.

1471
01:30:34,346 --> 01:30:38,350
To see if they could work together
when we needed them to,

1472
01:30:38,517 --> 01:30:41,812
to fight the battles that we never could.

1473
01:30:44,773 --> 01:30:49,695
Phil Coulson died
still believing in that idea.

1474
01:30:51,989 --> 01:30:53,699
In heroes.

1475
01:31:01,707 --> 01:31:03,334
Well,

1476
01:31:04,168 --> 01:31:06,879
it's an old-fashioned notion.

1479
01:31:43,666 --> 01:31:44,917
Did I hurt anybody?

1480
01:31:45,250 --> 01:31:48,379
There's nobody around here to get hurt.

1481
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:51,757
You did scare the hell
out of some pigeons, though.

1482
01:31:52,591 --> 01:31:53,676
Lucky.

1483
01:31:53,759 --> 01:31:55,094
Or just good aim.

1484
01:31:55,511 --> 01:31:56,804
You were awake when you fell.

1485
01:31:59,139 --> 01:32:00,933
- You saw?
- The whole thing.

1486
01:32:01,100 --> 01:32:02,768
Right through the ceiling.

1487
01:32:03,102 --> 01:32:07,106
Big and green and buck-ass nude.

1488
01:32:07,147 --> 01:32:08,315
Here.

1489
01:32:09,650 --> 01:32:11,902
Didn't think those would
fit you until you shrunk down

1490
01:32:11,944 --> 01:32:14,446
to a regular-size feller.

1491

1493
01:32:20,619 --> 01:32:21,829

1494
01:32:22,121 --> 01:32:23,497
From outer space, an alien.

1495
01:32:24,039 --> 01:32:25,082
No.

1496
01:32:25,708 --> 01:32:28,627
Well, then, son, you've got a condition.

1501
01:32:48,272 --> 01:32:50,149
Is that what you know?

1502
01:32:52,609 --> 01:32:55,487
I've got no window.

1503
01:32:56,071 --> 01:32:57,489
I have to flush him out.

1504

ROMANOFF: You got to level out.
It's going to take time.

1505
01:33:00,492 --> 01:33:01,910
You don't understand.

1506
01:33:03,996 --> 01:33:06,999
Have you ever had someone
take your brain and play?

1507
01:33:08,041 --> 01:33:12,296
Pull you out
and stuff something else in?

1508
01:33:15,382 --> 01:33:17,551
Do you know what it's like
to be unmade?

1509
01:33:19,344 --> 01:33:21,513
You know that I do.

1510
01:33:29,021 --> 01:33:30,063
Why am I back?

1511
01:33:31,482 --> 01:33:32,900
How did you get him out?

1512
01:33:32,983 --> 01:33:35,694
Cognitive recalibration.

1513
01:33:35,944 --> 01:33:38,489
I hit you really hard on the head.

1514
01:33:38,572 --> 01:33:39,698
Thanks.

1515
01:33:44,161 --> 01:33:45,704
Natasha...

1516
01:33:46,371 --> 01:33:47,498
How many agents did I...

1517
01:33:47,581 --> 01:33:49,124
Don't.

1518
01:33:49,374 --> 01:33:51,460
Don't do that to yourself, Clint.

1519
01:33:52,169 --> 01:33:53,921
This is Loki.

1520
01:33:54,254 --> 01:33:56,673
This is monsters and magic,

1521
01:33:56,715 --> 01:33:58,091
and nothing we were ever trained for.

1522
01:33:58,258 --> 01:33:59,843
Loki, did he get away?

1523
01:33:59,885 --> 01:34:00,886
Yeah.

1524
01:34:01,512 --> 01:34:03,597
I don't suppose you know where.

1525
01:34:03,889 --> 01:34:05,724
I didn't need to know.

1526
01:34:05,808 --> 01:34:07,559
I didn't ask.

1527
01:34:10,813 --> 01:34:13,065
He's going to
make his play soon, though.

1528
01:34:13,440 --> 01:34:14,483
Today.

1529
01:34:14,733 --> 01:34:15,859
We got to stop him.

1530
01:34:16,485 --> 01:34:17,820
Yeah? Who's "we"?

1531
01:34:18,028 --> 01:34:19,863
I don't know. Whoever's left.

1532
01:34:21,365 --> 01:34:22,741
Well,

1533
01:34:24,409 --> 01:34:26,578
if I put an arrow
through Loki's eye socket,

1534
01:34:26,703 --> 01:34:29,414
I would sleep better, I suppose.

1535
01:34:32,084 --> 01:34:33,585
Now you sound like you.

1536
01:34:34,253 --> 01:34:35,754
But you don't.

1537
01:34:37,923 --> 01:34:40,801
You're a spy, not a soldier.

1538
01:34:40,884 --> 01:34:45,639
Now you want to wade into a war. Why?

1539
01:34:47,391 --> 01:34:49,393
What did Loki do to you?

1540
01:34:50,102 --> 01:34:52,563
He didn't. I just...

1541
01:34:56,275 --> 01:34:57,818
Natasha.

1542
01:34:59,903 --> 01:35:01,947
I've been compromised.

1543
01:35:04,950 --> 01:35:06,869
I got red in my ledger.

1544
01:35:09,204 --> 01:35:11,331
I would like to wipe it out.

1545
01:35:27,306 --> 01:35:28,891
Was he married?

1546
01:35:28,974 --> 01:35:30,434
No.

1547
01:35:30,475 --> 01:35:34,771
There was a cellist, I think.

1548
01:35:36,315 --> 01:35:37,774
I'm sorry.

1549
01:35:38,442 --> 01:35:39,860
He seemed like a good man.

1550
01:35:41,361 --> 01:35:42,529
He was an idiot.

1551
01:35:42,613 --> 01:35:44,698
Why? For believing?

1552
01:35:44,990 --> 01:35:46,450
For taking on Loki alone.

1553
01:35:46,491 --> 01:35:48,285
He was doing his job.

1554
01:35:48,327 --> 01:35:50,662
(SCOFFS) He was out of his league.
He should have waited.

1555
01:35:50,746 --> 01:35:51,830
He should have...

1556
01:35:52,164 --> 01:35:53,665
Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.

1557
01:35:53,874 --> 01:35:56,084
Right, I've heard that before.

1558
01:35:56,168 --> 01:35:57,336
Is this the first time you lost a soldier?

1559
01:35:57,669 --> 01:35:59,296
We are not soldiers.

1560
01:36:04,009 --> 01:36:05,594
I'm not marching to Fury's fife.

Neither am I.

1562
01:36:07,179 --> 01:36:09,473
He's got the same blood
on his hands that Loki does.

1563
01:36:09,514 --> 01:36:10,974
But right now,
we got to put that behind us

1564
01:36:11,016 --> 01:36:13,018
and get this done.

1565
01:36:13,226 --> 01:36:14,227
Loki needs a power source.

1566
01:36:14,311 --> 01:36:15,312
If we can put together a list...

1567
01:36:15,354 --> 01:36:16,355
He made it personal.

1568
01:36:16,688 --> 01:36:17,689
That's not the point.

1569
01:36:17,856 --> 01:36:20,275
That is the point. That's Loki's point.

1570
01:36:20,484 --> 01:36:22,152
He hit us all right where we live. Why?

1571
01:36:22,527 --> 01:36:23,570
To tear us apart.

1572
01:36:24,029 --> 01:36:25,530
Yeah, divide and conquer is great

1573
01:36:25,614 --> 01:36:28,158
but he knows he has to
take us out to win, right?

1574
01:36:28,200 --> 01:36:29,826
That's what he wants.

1575
01:36:29,868 --> 01:36:32,120
He wants to beat us,
he wants to be seen doing it.

1576
01:36:32,287 --> 01:36:33,372
He wants an audience.

1577
01:36:34,373 --> 01:36:36,041
Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart.

1578
01:36:36,124 --> 01:36:39,127
Yeah, that was just previews.
This is opening night.

1579

And Loki, he's a full-tilt diva, right?

1580
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:43,507
He wants flowers, he wants parades.

1581
01:36:43,548 --> 01:36:47,052
He wants a monument built to the skies

you've managed to piss off
every single one of them.
