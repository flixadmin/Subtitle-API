00:00:04,547 --> 00:00:05,547
[Fast Track screaming]

2
00:00:15,016 --> 00:00:16,016
You were dead.

3
00:00:17,227 --> 00:00:18,228
I saw your body.

4
00:00:18,478 --> 00:00:19,478
And yet...

5
00:00:20,104 --> 00:00:23,358
here I am, in the flesh.

6
00:00:24,484 --> 00:00:25,818
How's that possible?

7
00:00:26,277 --> 00:00:28,029
The Negative Forces...

8
00:00:29,364 --> 00:00:30,573
brought me back.

9
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:32,158
Because they were too weak

10
00:00:32,367 --> 00:00:35,370
without a fourth member
of their merry band.

11
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:37,163
Didn't I tell you...

12
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:40,917
that finding ways to kill you

13
00:00:41,751 --> 00:00:43,294
is my life's work?

14
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:47,257
Here's what's really funny.

15
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,384
Killing your mother

16
00:00:50,218 --> 00:00:52,011
led to the birth of the Flash,

17
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:53,930
and killing Iris...

18
00:00:55,265 --> 00:00:57,058
led to the rebirth of me.

19
00:00:57,934 --> 00:01:02,272
So I guess you could say
your mother and Iris...

20
00:01:03,815 --> 00:01:05,066
were good for something.

21
00:01:05,608 --> 00:01:06,608
[yelling]

22
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:12,824
[screaming]

23
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:14,824
Dad! Stop!

24
00:01:14,826 --> 00:01:15,826
He's not worth it.

25
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:17,120
He killed your mother!

26
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:18,204
[laughing]

27
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:21,499
Dad, if you do this,
you'll be just as bad as him!

28
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:29,424
[panting]

29
00:01:30,675 --> 00:01:32,760
[Reverse-Flash] Yeah,
what's the matter, Flash?

30
00:01:34,304 --> 00:01:35,805
You can't finish the job?

31
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:38,850
You better finish the job!

32
00:01:39,559 --> 00:01:41,311
Because if you don't...

33
00:01:43,646 --> 00:01:44,646
they're next.

34
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,317
Dad, don't listen to him, please.

35
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,486
Even if he did kill Mom,
now, in 2022, we're still here.

36
00:01:50,862 --> 00:01:52,280
Don't you see? We're still alive.

37
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:54,925
[Impulse] She's right. We haven't been
erased from the timeline yet.

38
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:57,285
Which means Mom isn't dead yet.

39
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:43,955
They're both hurting.

40
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:47,627
- Badly.
- Okay, so what do we do now?

41
00:02:47,752 --> 00:02:49,837
We find Iris and we bring her home.

42
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:52,002
Then we find a way to take down
the Negative Forces,

43
00:02:52,048 --> 00:02:54,258
'cause if they come back
for a rematch...

44
00:02:54,342 --> 00:02:55,510
I don't think they will.

45
00:02:56,094 --> 00:02:57,534
They already got what they came for.

46
00:02:58,012 --> 00:02:59,347
The last Thawne in existence.

47
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,848
What do they need him for anyway?

48
00:03:01,015 --> 00:03:02,534
[The Flash] There's only one way
to find out.

49
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:04,811
I have to find a way
into the Negative Speed Force.

50
00:03:07,772 --> 00:03:08,772
Dad.

51
00:03:10,108 --> 00:03:11,442
No offense. That's insane.

52
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:12,568
I don't have a choice.

53
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,339
As long as Thawne's out there,
everyone's in danger.

54
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:17,115
Chester already ran a satellite search.

55
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:18,700
Thawne's nowhere on the planet.

56
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:21,095
The only place left to hide
is the Negative Speed Force.

57
00:03:21,119 --> 00:03:22,513
- So if I can find a way in...
- [Cecile] No.

58
00:03:22,537 --> 00:03:25,289
Look, I can feel
all of the anger inside you, I can.

59
00:03:25,373 --> 00:03:28,084
And I know that you've been
to hell and back today,

60
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:31,254
but we need to think
our next move through.

61
00:03:31,337 --> 00:03:32,338
He killed Iris!

62
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:39,095
Barry, how can you possibly be so sure?

63
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,470
Because I am.

64
00:03:42,098 --> 00:03:43,098
[XS] Guys.

65
00:03:44,851 --> 00:03:46,144
We need to talk to our dad.

66
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:52,357
Fine.

67
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:55,695
I'll call Joe and tell him
that we're all okay.

68
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:02,283
[XS] Look.

69
00:04:02,285 --> 00:04:05,037
Assuming we can find our way
into the Negative Speed Force,

70
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:06,914
let us handle this.

71
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:11,127
We will make sure
Thawne gets back to Iron Heights.

72
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,087
Dad, we promise.

73
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:15,046
You weren't there.

74
00:04:16,966 --> 00:04:18,259
You didn't see what I saw.

75
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:23,973
Iris died in my arms

76
00:04:25,057 --> 00:04:26,809
before her body disappeared.

77
00:04:28,603 --> 00:04:29,603
You say she's alive,

78
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:33,024
but for all we know, she's already
been erased from this timeline.

79
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:34,947
Only the changes haven't caught up
with us yet.

80
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,067
It's happened before.

81
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:38,237
You still want to kill him.

82
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:40,739
Don't you?

83
00:04:52,043 --> 00:04:53,043
Hello?

84
00:04:59,217 --> 00:05:00,217
Is anybody here?

85
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,220
[Damien] Hello, Iris.

86
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:07,849
Damien?

87
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:11,395
If you're here,
does that mean that I'm dead, too?

88
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:12,480
No, it doesn't.

89
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:16,025
What happened to you
is far more interesting than that.

90
00:05:17,902 --> 00:05:19,028
We have a lot to discuss.

91
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:29,497
[The Flash] Going inside
is the only way to end this.

92
00:05:29,664 --> 00:05:31,082
Barry, it sounds dangerous.

93
00:05:31,332 --> 00:05:32,332
'Cause it is.

94
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,003
Fine.

95
00:05:37,213 --> 00:05:40,967
So how exactly do you get inside
the Negative Speed Force?

96
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:43,803
The first time
I went into the Positive Speed Force,

97
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:47,265
Harry hit me with a concentrated blast
of dark matter and lightning

98
00:05:47,348 --> 00:05:49,183
that generated a tachyon reaction.

99
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:51,686
Well, I could rig the tachyon harness
to do the same.

100
00:05:51,936 --> 00:05:54,355
Only if you're trying to get into
a negative place,

101
00:05:54,939 --> 00:05:56,979
you're going to need
a negative source of lightning.

102
00:05:57,692 --> 00:05:58,692
Like me.

103
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:01,194
[Cecile] Uh...

104
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,699
Meena, I don't think
that's such a good idea right now.

105
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:06,242
We need to find a way in.

106
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,120
I'm the key.

107
00:06:11,539 --> 00:06:12,899
Chester, go ahead and get started.

108
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,240
You wanna tell me how you're gonna deal
with all of that anger?

109
00:06:30,224 --> 00:06:31,224
Barry,

110
00:06:32,018 --> 00:06:34,645
I can feel it pouring off of you.

111
00:06:36,022 --> 00:06:37,022
What are you planning?

112
00:06:41,652 --> 00:06:42,695
Oh, my God.

113
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,323
You want revenge.

114
00:06:46,616 --> 00:06:49,869
But why?
Bart and Nora said that Iris is alive.

115
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:51,037
And I know she's not.

116
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:55,791
[male voice] <i>Cecile. Cecile.</i>

117
00:06:57,126 --> 00:06:58,126
What is it?

118
00:06:58,127 --> 00:06:59,379
Someone's calling my name.

119
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,759
And now I'm picking up desperation.

120
00:07:05,343 --> 00:07:06,636
[Bashir] You have to find us.

121
00:07:08,471 --> 00:07:10,222
You're the only one that can help us.

122
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:11,709
- [The Flash] Who is it?
- Bashir?

123
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:14,144
What happened to you?
Where are the other Forces?

124
00:07:20,066 --> 00:07:21,066
He's gone.

125
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:22,944
- Was it our Bashir?
- Yeah.

126
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,071
And he's in pretty bad shape.

127
00:07:25,655 --> 00:07:26,655
He said that...

128
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:28,616
I'm the only one who can help them.

129
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:34,622
I think he wants me to help bring back
the other Positive Forces.

130
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:00,898
His timeline's gone.

131
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:02,399
I love you.

132
00:08:04,777 --> 00:08:07,113
[Negative Deon] Well, we wanted you
to feel at home.

133
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,290
You, uh...

134
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,876
You know who we are.

135
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:25,131
Beings who can do all this.

136
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:29,385
I'm guessing you're the Negative Forces.

137
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:30,845
Why am I here?

138
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:34,348
You never wondered
where your speed really comes from?

139
00:08:35,141 --> 00:08:36,851
I built a machine...

140
00:08:38,811 --> 00:08:40,771
that taps into the Negative Speed Force,

141
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:43,107
allowing me to siphon it for my own use.

142
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:45,316
Brilliant.

143
00:08:45,735 --> 00:08:47,194
Oh, you didn't tap into it.

144
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,864
No, no, no. It tapped into you.

145
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:53,241
It's true.

146
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:56,579
The Negative Speed Force
has always existed.

147
00:08:56,954 --> 00:08:59,040
It chose you as an avatar

148
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:01,709
because it feeds off your hatred
for Barry Allen.

149
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:03,676
[Negative Alexa] The other Thawne
forgot that.

150
00:09:04,295 --> 00:09:07,256
No hate, no Negative Speed Force avatar.

151
00:09:08,132 --> 00:09:09,300
That's why he had to go.

152
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:11,177
I don't know what you're planning.

153
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:16,849
But if you think I'm gonna stand here
and play your stupid game...

154
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:21,854
[Negative Alexa] Relax.

155
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:23,856
We're not gonna hurt you.

156
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:25,900
I'm just gonna transform you.

157
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:32,073
[Damien] So, let me guess.

158
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,450
The last thing you remember is

159
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:38,037
figuring out that the Negative Forces
used your time sickness

160
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:40,873
- to rebirth a new avatar.
- Yes.

161
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:42,976
But if I've had this time sickness
for months, then...

162
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,918
Why now?

163
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:47,213
The Negative Forces
used your body as an incubator.

164
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:49,840
And, yes, it's a dastardly scheme.

165
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:52,218
Reminds me of my bad old days.

166
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:53,844
Okay, so if I'm alive, then...

167
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:56,346
Where am I?

168
00:09:56,597 --> 00:09:58,390
You're here inside my Time Stone.

169
00:09:58,849 --> 00:10:02,269
The talisman that you and Barry used
to wipe out anachronisms during...

170
00:10:03,354 --> 00:10:04,354
Armageddon.

171
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:10,569
I can't feel my connection
to Barry anymore.

172
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:13,419
And if it's the same for him,
then Damien,

173
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,366
I have to get out of here
and I need your help.

174
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:18,452
- Even if you're...
- A remnant of my old consciousness

175
00:10:18,869 --> 00:10:19,995
imprinted on a stone?

176
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,332
Bearing witness
to all timelines for eternity.

177
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,208
Wahoo.

178
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:27,214
Are you saying that
I'm stuck here forever, too?

179
00:10:27,545 --> 00:10:28,545
Oh, no, no, no.

180
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:29,588
No, that's up to you.

181
00:10:30,256 --> 00:10:31,632
See, unlike me,

182
00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:33,259
you aren't supposed to be dead.

183
00:10:33,843 --> 00:10:35,737
Which is why,
at the moment that the Negative Forces

184
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:37,179
annihilated your body,

185
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:38,973
the stone spared you.

186
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:42,726
It senses that you still have
something important to do.

187
00:10:43,727 --> 00:10:44,727
The question is,

188
00:10:45,229 --> 00:10:46,229
are you up to it?

189
00:10:51,694 --> 00:10:55,239
[Chester] Okay, you all ready?
The harnesses are good to go.

190
00:10:59,577 --> 00:11:00,786
[all grunting]

191
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,870
What is happening?

192
00:11:03,122 --> 00:11:05,332
- Oh, God.
- I'm shutting down remote ignition.

193
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,376
- Keep on going.
- But, Barr...

194
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:08,459
Do it!

195
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,176
[yelling]

196
00:11:15,634 --> 00:11:16,634
I'm calling it.

197
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,470
Dad!

198
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:22,683
- Why didn't it work?
- I don't know.

199
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:25,120
If this won't work, we can't access
the Negative Speed Force.

200
00:11:25,144 --> 00:11:26,464
Then we need to find another way.

201
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,358
Eobard would have known what to do.

202
00:11:33,986 --> 00:11:34,986
But now he's gone.

203
00:11:37,698 --> 00:11:38,698
Because of me...

204
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,120
and that damn machine.

205
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:45,955
Dad.

206
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:56,966
Meena...

207
00:11:57,843 --> 00:11:58,759
You don't want to do this.

208
00:11:58,761 --> 00:11:59,929
Yes, I do.

209
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:02,389
This machine ruined my life.

210
00:12:02,473 --> 00:12:03,473
No, it didn't.

211
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:05,308
Thawne did.

212
00:12:12,608 --> 00:12:16,779
There is nothing we can do about it!

213
00:12:20,366 --> 00:12:21,408
Not anymore.

214
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:29,666
Yes, there is.

215
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:31,627
Look, Meena...

216
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:34,255
I know exactly how you feel.

217
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:36,715
You're the only one who understands.

218
00:12:37,049 --> 00:12:38,717
Who knows how this has to end.

219
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:42,680
That's why you can't destroy your work.
We need it.

220
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:44,555
What for?

221
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:46,558
So we can get you charged...

222
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:49,293
and you can share your speed again.

223
00:12:50,396 --> 00:12:51,396
With me.

224
00:13:08,122 --> 00:13:09,456
Your speed's at 100%.

225
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:14,128
Promise me when you find that bastard,

226
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:17,506
you'll never let him hurt anyone else
ever again.

227
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:23,147
Do you remember what you did
when you shared your speed with Eobard?

228
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:26,953
You told me I had to share
the most important parts of myself.

229
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:46,367
Baby girl...

230
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,705
Wherever you are,

231
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,793
please, please,

232
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:57,921
come back home soon.

233
00:14:02,343 --> 00:14:03,927
Jay? Joan? What are you...

234
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:05,386
What are you doing here?

235
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:08,265
We've been following Iris'
particle trail across the timestream,

236
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:10,142
and it led us here.

237
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:13,020
When Cecile called,
she said that Iris was still missing.

238
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,814
- [tracker beeping]
- Not anymore.

239
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:18,733
Come this way.

240
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:33,248
What is that thing?

241
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:34,875
[Garrick] It's a time stone.

242
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:37,586
I've heard about it in my travels.

243
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:39,212
Where did you get it?

244
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:45,928
Damien Darhk gave it to me.
He said I might need it one day.

245
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:48,597
But why is it glowing now?

246
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,265
Those particles that were left behind?

247
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,643
They're Iris' consciousness.

248
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,105
And now I think they've somehow
ended up inside the stone.

249
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:57,856
How do we get her out of there?

250
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:07,675
I can't believe we're doing this.

251
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:10,160
Look, Allegra, we have to bring
the Positive Forces back.

252
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:12,371
This is the only way
we can help Flash do it.

253
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,873
Who cares about him?

254
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:16,874
Yeah.

255
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:18,585
We just want our powers back.

256
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:21,839
Okay, look,
both of you are now ex-psychics,

257
00:15:21,922 --> 00:15:23,757
but you know exactly the way
that this works.

258
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:27,719
Now start concentrating
and help me focus in.

259
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:29,333
I will do all the heavy lifting.

260
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:51,784
You found me.

261
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:52,785
[gasps]

262
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,370
Oh...

263
00:15:54,913 --> 00:15:56,248
Oh, my God, are you okay?

264
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,586
This is a nice office.

265
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:01,879
What happened?

266
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,841
Iris' time sickness, it spread to us.

267
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:09,344
So we needed to tether ourselves
to someone in this reality.

268
00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:10,512
I chose Cecile.

269
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:12,890
- Why?
- Because of your boundless potential.

270
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:14,615
So I opened the floodgates of your mind.

271
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:16,894
That's how you were able to absorb
the gifts of others.

272
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:18,831
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on, wait, wait.

273
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:22,566
So you're the guy
who gave her all of our powers?

274
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:23,858
Mm.

275
00:16:23,984 --> 00:16:24,984
Thanks.

276
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:27,321
You're... welcome.

277
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:30,824
So you now have the strength
to bring back the Forces.

278
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:32,428
That is, if you're willing to help us.

279
00:16:32,493 --> 00:16:33,493
Of course I will.

280
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:35,409
What do you need me to do?

281
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,212
Your biometrics are spiking.

282
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:45,047
We thought the bad Forces were back,

283
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,716
but now you're going into
the Negative Speed Force without us.

284
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:52,887
We're too late.

285
00:16:54,223 --> 00:16:55,223
[grunts]

286
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,020
Thawne.

287
00:17:11,907 --> 00:17:12,907
What the hell?

288
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:15,327
Eobard can't come to the phone
right now.

289
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:17,287
He's going through some changes.

290
00:17:17,621 --> 00:17:18,705
What are you doing to him?

291
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,876
Helping him reach his full potential.

292
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:26,421
If this was all about Thawne,
why did you attack us?

293
00:17:26,547 --> 00:17:29,424
Oh, man, you came at us first

294
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:31,843
for Armageddon.

295
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:36,306
When you cut off the
Negative Speed Force from his avatar.

296
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:38,433
[yelling]

297
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:40,726
Now, see, we...

298
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:43,827
We've been pulling the strings
ever since.

299
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:46,441
Finally ready now.

300
00:17:47,693 --> 00:17:49,570
[Negative Bashir] See,
this is on you, Flash.

301
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:51,363
You tipped the scales.

302
00:17:51,947 --> 00:17:53,073
We're just...

303
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,910
putting things back to normal,
and then some.

304
00:17:57,578 --> 00:17:59,162
[screaming]

305
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:04,459
This all started the day
that you severed Thawne's speed.

306
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:07,713
The day that you upset
the cosmic balance.

307
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:09,756
Something we didn't know was possible...

308
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:12,509
until you showed us how.

309
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,598
And that was also the day
that we realized...

310
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,226
we could do the same.

311
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:25,230
Time to tip the scales.

312
00:18:27,232 --> 00:18:28,148
[grunts]

313
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,610
Dad, are you okay?

314
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:31,737
It's all my fault.

315
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:33,779
What about Thawne?

316
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,782
The Negative Forces.

317
00:18:35,532 --> 00:18:37,034
They were transforming him somehow.

318
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:38,160
So he's still alive.

319
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,621
But they already gave him
his speed back.

320
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:42,039
What more could they want?

321
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:44,081
[Chester] Guys?

322
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:46,752
I'm picking up a huge influx
of negative kinetic tachyons.

323
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:48,419
Where?

324
00:18:51,423 --> 00:18:52,591
Right over downtown.

325
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:09,232
[people screaming]

326
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,072
There's no point in running.

327
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:19,034
[distorted] You're all going to die.

328
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:20,577
[people screaming]

329
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:36,301

330
00:19:48,689 --> 00:19:50,023
[XS] Holy shrap. That's Thawne.

331
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:51,274
Who's his new tailor?

332
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:53,275
Satan?

333
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:56,488
[Chester] Guys, I'm not just picking up
negative kinetic isotopes.

334
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:59,741
Reading temporal, geothermic,
electrochemical ones, too.

335
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:02,411
He has the power
of all four Negative Forces now.

336
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:03,786
Why?

337
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:07,416
To tip the balance of power
in their favor.

338
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,668
Turn the entire world
into a living hell.

339
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,341
You said I had unfinished business.

340
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:20,636
What is it?

341
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:25,183
It's Barry, isn't it?

342
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:28,812
Where is he? What's happening?

343
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:32,190
If you want to find out,
you have to get out of here yourself.

344
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:35,526
How, damn it?

345
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,404
Oh, come on, Iris.

346
00:20:38,071 --> 00:20:39,072
Look at your life.

347
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:41,074
Look at everything
that has happened to you

348
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:42,868
since Barry went into that coma.

349
00:20:43,535 --> 00:20:45,162
<i>You were destined to die,</i>

350
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:47,831
<i>held captive in another dimension.</i>

351
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:51,585
Hell, you faced certain death
over and over and over again.

352
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:54,087
And every time you should have died,
only you didn't.

353
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:55,171
Why?

354
00:20:55,672 --> 00:20:56,923
Because I always had help, I...

355
00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:59,634
[mimics buzzer] Thanks for playing.
Wrong answer.

356
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:01,719
Come on.

357
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:03,805
It's right in front of you.

358
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:05,306
You're a survivor.

359
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:07,434
You always will be.

360
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:11,813
I haven't reached my limit.

361
00:21:12,773 --> 00:21:14,900
No, you haven't.

362
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:17,110
But what about the spark
between Barry and I?

363
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:18,987
Well...

364
00:21:22,324 --> 00:21:24,034
Just because you can't feel it,

365
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:26,745
doesn't mean it isn't there.

366
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,457
So, what are you gonna do now?

367
00:21:30,582 --> 00:21:34,169
Spend the rest of eternity
hanging out with Damien Darhk?

368
00:21:38,757 --> 00:21:39,757
No.

369
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:42,219
Atta girl!

370
00:21:44,012 --> 00:21:45,138
I'm gonna reignite it.

371
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,403
Say hi to your old man for me.

372
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:10,539
[screaming continues]

373
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:34,980
You're outnumbered. Four to one.

374
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:37,357
You're going to pay
for everyone you've hurt.

375
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:40,026
Especially Eobard.

376
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,005
[screaming]

377
00:23:07,345 --> 00:23:08,345
Bart?

378
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:11,558
Dad? Is he going to be okay?

379
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:14,644
If that's Impulse, where is Thawne?

380
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:16,645
Right here.

381
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:25,030
What did you do?

382
00:23:25,155 --> 00:23:26,615
I sent them back in time.

383
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:30,118
A billion years, to be precise.

384
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:34,858
[Bashir] We only have one chance.

385
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:41,671
Okay. What do you need me to do?

386
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:46,425
Put it on.

387
00:23:48,428 --> 00:23:50,722
There's a reason you were given
all these powers, Cecile.

388
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:55,018
The powers you absorbed were enhanced
by the one thing that I like.

389
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:57,270
Your ability to care about people.

390
00:23:58,188 --> 00:23:59,268
That's why you were chosen.

391
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:01,316
So, take it.

392
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:05,320
The mask will reabsorb your
psychic powers and transfer them to me.

393
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:10,951
Don't even think about it.

394
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:29,803
[screaming]

395
00:24:32,222 --> 00:24:33,222
[Bashir] Wait.

396
00:24:33,556 --> 00:24:34,849
She has to go through this.

397
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:44,943
Cecile, are you okay?

398
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:49,322
Did it work?

399
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:52,617
I sure as hell hope so.

400
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:17,641
[exhales]

401
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:21,938
Well, well, well.

402
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:28,403
Who's faster now, Flash?

403
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:44,878
Oh! [laughing]

404
00:25:45,336 --> 00:25:46,796
How does it feel, Flash?

405
00:25:46,921 --> 00:25:51,926
How does it feel knowing
you could have prevented all this?

406
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:56,264
If only you'd killed me

407
00:25:57,307 --> 00:25:59,601
when you had the chance.

408
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:02,562
Believe me...

409
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:07,192
that's a mistake I won't make.

410
00:26:15,784 --> 00:26:16,784
Who's doing this?

411
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,163
Who's doing this?

412
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:22,164
[Deon] I am.

413
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:32,425
You're too late
because your pathetic avatar

414
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:34,511
is powerless.

415
00:26:34,761 --> 00:26:35,887
You call that power?

416
00:26:37,889 --> 00:26:39,390
This is power.

417
00:27:06,417 --> 00:27:07,627
This is impossible.

418
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:10,672
No, this is the end.

419
00:27:21,474 --> 00:27:22,767
We're equals now, Thawne.

420
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:24,810
Equals?

421
00:27:25,728 --> 00:27:26,728
Never.

422
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:28,565
I have always been,

423
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:30,900
I will always be better than you.

424
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:54,090
This is for Iris,

425
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:56,718
for everyone you've killed.

What is it?

429
00:28:26,206 --> 00:28:30,335
Some kind of temporal disruption
coming from inside the stone.

[Iris West screaming]

- Dad!

434
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:50,021
It's okay. It's okay.
Damien Darhk showed me the way back.

That felt like an earthquake.

00:28:57,528 --> 00:28:59,197
Or something a lot worse.

438

They started Armageddon.

Jay, I need you

Iris?

448
00:29:46,077 --> 00:29:47,077
Barry, you have to stop.

449
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:48,370
No, I have to finish this.

450
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:49,747
No, Barry, listen to me.

451
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:51,141
The city can't take any more fighting.

452
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:52,165
That's why I have to end this.

453

You can't!

[Negative Reverse-Flash] She's right.

We'll never stop

I'll slaughter you where you sit!

00:31:00,318 --> 00:31:02,779
I just need more power.

What is that?

It's the universe resetting itself.

481
00:33:58,037 --> 00:34:00,039
[Joan] Barry,
your Force particles are gone.

482
00:34:00,248 --> 00:34:01,749
And as for you, Iris,

483
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,627
there's no sign
of your time sickness anywhere.

484
00:34:05,086 --> 00:34:06,087
You're completely cured.

485
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:10,299
And Gideon says there's no Thawne
anywhere in the timeline.

486
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:12,468
Then it's really over.

487
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,220
All of it.

488
00:34:17,557 --> 00:34:20,893
Bart, Nora, about the way
I behaved today...

489
00:34:21,102 --> 00:34:22,102
Uh-uh.

490
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:23,436
No.

491
00:34:24,063 --> 00:34:27,108
Not after all of the things
that you have helped us with.

492
00:34:28,442 --> 00:34:31,112
He's right, Dad.
At the end of the day, all that matters

493
00:34:31,612 --> 00:34:33,072
is you did the right thing.

494
00:34:36,075 --> 00:34:40,663
And on that note, I think we should all
go back to our lives in 2049.

00:34:41,372 --> 00:34:43,291
- Great work today, Flash.
- Thank you.

00:34:43,374 --> 00:34:44,458
As always.

497
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:45,959
Thank you.

498
00:34:46,836 --> 00:34:47,836
Bye.

499
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:51,632
Guys, guys!

500
00:34:51,841 --> 00:34:53,593
Thank you for everything.

501
00:34:53,676 --> 00:34:54,760
Don't sweat it, Pops.

502
00:34:56,178 --> 00:34:58,848
It was all "aster." No "dis."

503
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:00,516
No idea what that means.

504
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,101
[all chuckling]

505
00:35:02,184 --> 00:35:03,184
You don't need to.

506
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:07,732
All right, love you, Pops.

507
00:35:08,274 --> 00:35:09,650
- Mom.
- See you, guys.

508
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:11,652
We love you.

509
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:18,909
How are you feeling?

510
00:35:19,535 --> 00:35:22,079
Like there is so much I don't know.
[chuckles]

511
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:25,166
But more importantly,

512
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:27,585
the B.L.O.C. is no longer working.

513
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:32,673
It was never my idea, was it?

514
00:35:34,592 --> 00:35:35,592
No, it wasn't.

515
00:35:36,594 --> 00:35:39,305
The Negative Speed Force
used the machine to pick its avatars.

516
00:35:40,264 --> 00:35:41,390
You were a means to an end.

517
00:35:44,226 --> 00:35:45,645
I'm sorry you lost your speed.

518
00:35:45,895 --> 00:35:49,523
Don't be. It was never
my dream to be a speedster.

519
00:35:51,484 --> 00:35:52,902
I know I never got to meet him,

520
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,489
but Eobard seemed like
a very special person.

521
00:35:56,697 --> 00:35:57,740
He was.

522
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:02,659
I wanted to give you this.

523
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:05,706
[Barry] We found it at S.T.A.R. Labs.

524
00:36:06,791 --> 00:36:07,791
[sniffles]

525
00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:14,297
Thank you.

526
00:36:16,467 --> 00:36:17,467
For everything.

527
00:36:25,893 --> 00:36:26,893
I should go.

528
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:31,524
Hey, Meena, look, if you need anything,
just call us, okay?

529
00:36:31,941 --> 00:36:32,941
We're here for you.

530
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:33,983
I know.

531
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:39,657
Oh, and if Team Flash ever needs a
helping hand,

532
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,701
as in the technical kind,

533
00:36:43,536 --> 00:36:44,576
you know where to find me.

534
00:36:56,507 --> 00:36:59,343
[Chester] Good news. Your brain's back
to its old empathic capacity.

535
00:36:59,635 --> 00:37:01,137
Dillon has her powers back.

536
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,973
The Queen, too,
who's back in Iron Heights.

537
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:05,683
I am going to miss being leveled up.

538
00:37:05,766 --> 00:37:08,144
I'm just glad we all survived this.

539
00:37:08,352 --> 00:37:10,771
Yeah, yeah, I guess I should be happy.

540
00:37:10,855 --> 00:37:13,107
We did bring back the Positive Forces,

541
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,067
and then there was
saving the entire city.

542
00:37:15,151 --> 00:37:16,569
That should be good enough.

543
00:37:17,153 --> 00:37:18,362
A humble brag?

544
00:37:18,529 --> 00:37:20,281
Go ahead, girl. I see you.

545
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:24,160
Look, here's to saving the world,

546
00:37:24,952 --> 00:37:27,037
friends and Team Flash.

547
00:37:27,413 --> 00:37:29,457
Or, as I like to call it,

548
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:30,998
Team Badass.

549
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,958
- Okay.
- Yeah.

550
00:37:31,959 --> 00:37:33,919
- Team Badass! Come on!
- Team Badass!

551
00:37:34,795 --> 00:37:36,422
Mm. Mm-mm.

552
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,509
Okay, that is not a decaf latte.

553
00:37:40,593 --> 00:37:42,136
And this does not have three sugars.

554
00:37:42,303 --> 00:37:45,055
Cecile, I'm sorry.
I guess we mixed up coffees.

555
00:37:45,139 --> 00:37:46,139
I already, uh...

556
00:37:46,432 --> 00:37:47,600
No worries, it's fine.

557
00:37:53,814 --> 00:37:55,566
Cecile, did you do that?

558
00:37:55,858 --> 00:37:56,858
Uh...

559
00:37:57,651 --> 00:37:58,651
Yeah?

560
00:37:59,236 --> 00:38:00,236
But...

561
00:38:00,905 --> 00:38:03,300
Okay, all I did was think
I really wish I had the right coffee.

562
00:38:03,324 --> 00:38:04,593
And then I kind of saw it in my head.

563
00:38:04,617 --> 00:38:05,977
And then all of a sudden it was...

564
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:10,039
Oh, the Force is strong with this one.

565
00:38:10,664 --> 00:38:11,664
Huh.

566
00:38:12,875 --> 00:38:13,875
Well...

567
00:38:15,419 --> 00:38:16,419
that's new.

568
00:38:23,552 --> 00:38:25,471
[Tinya] I never thought
I'd see you again.

569
00:38:27,598 --> 00:38:32,019
I don't mean to be rude or whatever,
but why am I here?

570
00:38:36,649 --> 00:38:37,649
[Renee] Tinya.

571
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:39,734
Mom?

572
00:38:40,528 --> 00:38:41,528
It's really you?

573
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,540
I didn't know
if I'd ever get out of that place.

574
00:38:50,204 --> 00:38:52,164
I just knew I had to see you again.

575
00:38:53,457 --> 00:38:54,458
How did this happen?

576
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:57,920
When Iris beat her time sickness,
it cured the Still Force, too.

577
00:38:58,379 --> 00:39:00,631
And then Renee showed up
back at home in Coast City.

578
00:39:02,299 --> 00:39:03,634
We have so much to catch up on.

579
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:06,344
Thank you.

580
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:08,012
You're welcome.

581
00:39:26,198 --> 00:39:27,366
[laptop beeping]

582
00:39:32,496 --> 00:39:33,622
Chamber malfunction?

583
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,458
What do you mean, chamber malfunction?

584
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:44,758
Frost, are you okay?

585
00:39:49,388 --> 00:39:50,388
Frost?

586
00:39:54,143 --> 00:39:55,185
Who the hell are you?

587
00:39:56,228 --> 00:39:57,228
[woman] A friend...

588
00:39:58,856 --> 00:39:59,856
I think.

589
00:40:11,744 --> 00:40:12,953
I never want to let you go.

590
00:40:14,872 --> 00:40:15,872
Then don't.

591
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:18,918
I mean, I could stay like this all week.

592
00:40:19,585 --> 00:40:21,253
- That works for me.
- [chuckles]

593
00:40:24,965 --> 00:40:27,092
Iris, last night,
I thought I lost you forever,

594
00:40:27,968 --> 00:40:29,528
because I couldn't feel our connection.

595
00:40:31,472 --> 00:40:33,992
Yeah, when I was in the time stone,
I couldn't feel you, either.

596
00:40:35,559 --> 00:40:37,311
That's why I knew
I had to get back to you.

597
00:40:39,563 --> 00:40:41,565
So, I reignited our spark.

598
00:40:43,317 --> 00:40:44,317
How?

599
00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:48,364
You're my lightning rod, too.

600
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:58,289
Thank you.

601
00:40:58,666 --> 00:40:59,666
Seriously?

602
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:02,127
I mean, I've been gone
for a while, but...

603
00:41:02,503 --> 00:41:05,464
For reminding me
that even the Flash has limits.

604
00:41:06,924 --> 00:41:08,592
Thawne couldn't accept that
about himself.

605
00:41:09,635 --> 00:41:11,053
Which is why he didn't survive.

606
00:41:17,434 --> 00:41:20,274
Barry, you know the Negative Speed Force
will need to find a new avatar.

607
00:41:20,521 --> 00:41:21,521
I know.

608
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:25,372
<i>Because the universe
is all about balance.</i>

609
00:41:28,362 --> 00:41:29,655
<i>Which means that one day,</i>

610
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:32,491
<i>the Negative Forces
will have to pick one.</i>

611
00:41:36,078 --> 00:41:37,678
[Iris West] <i>I wonder who they'll choose.</i>

612
00:41:39,748 --> 00:41:41,308
[Barry] <i>We won't know until it happens.</i>

613
00:41:42,376 --> 00:41:47,172
<i>But whenever that day comes,
and whoever that avatar is...</i>

614
00:41:51,218 --> 00:41:52,261
we'll be ready for them.
