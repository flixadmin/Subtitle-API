1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,840
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,840
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,520
Leonard. I must be losing my mind.

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,200
The reason why Snart and I
got on so well

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,200
was we trusted one another.
We were friends.

6
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,640
Have either of you gentlemen
heard of the Spear of Destiny?

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,480
The spear could alter reality itself.

8
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,280
We broke it
into four separate pieces.

9
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,480
Mr. Hunter took one...

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,840
And took the rest of you
to three different time periods,

11
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,200
which means
the last piece unaccounted

12
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,520
for must be with your grandfather.

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,800
Waverider crew,
we are now the proud owners

14
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,920
of the last fragment
of the Spear of Destiny.

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,160
Back in 1942, you have
a destiny waiting for you.

16
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,720
Ask Grey what happens
to your village,

17
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,120
ask him what happens to your daughter
and your granddaughter,

18
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,280
and tell me you'll choose history
over your own family.

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,600
Watch out, lads!

20
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,800
Incoming!

21
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,720
Coming through! Coming through!

22
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,800
According to this map,
Jesus' blood is somewhere over there.

23
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,800
The spear is sensing the blood.

24
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,560
We won't last five minutes out there.

25
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,840
It's not too late to use it.

26
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,880
It's hard to imagine that,
when joined with their siblings,

27
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,440
they're as powerful as God.

28
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,320
{\an5}But right now, that's just
a useless piece of wood.

29
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,560
It's not useless.

30
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,040
I know ten different ways
to kill somebody with this.

31
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,440
Not to mention,

32
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,400
it's great for scratching
in those hard-to-reach places.

33
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,320
Please don't tell me
you used the Spear of Destiny

34
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,520
as a back scratcher.

35
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,360
Who said anything about my back?

36
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,240
Well, as Mr. Rory has demonstrated,
in the wrong hands,

37
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,320
{\an5}this divine artifact
can be put to truly horrific use.

38
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,600
{\an5}- Yeah.
- Which is why I called this meeting,

39
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,680
{\an5}to figure out how to keep it out
the Legion's hands.

40
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,760
Where's Nate?

41
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,320
{\an5}Nathaniel said he wasn't
feeling up to socializing.

42
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,320
He said he'll go along
with whatever we decide.

43
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,880
What is there to decide?

44
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,440
{\an5}We find the Legion, and we steal
back their pieces of the spear.

45
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,040
There's no need to find the Legion.

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,480
I know where they've been
operating out of.

47
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,320
Why keep it a secret?
Let's just go get them.

48
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,280
{\an5}The reason why you've been
unable to locate Mr. Thawne

49
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,640
and his partners all this time

50
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,320
{\an5}is because they've been
operating outside of it.

51
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,640
- You lost me.
- Yeah, me too.

52
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,720
Three.

53
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,120
What's the one place
that exists outside of time?

54
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,840
- No way.
- Yes way.

55
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,080
We must return
to the Vanishing Point.

56
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,920
We're in position. Ray?

57
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,240
{\an5}<i>- Ready.</i>
- Mick?

58
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,120
{\an5}<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Standby.

59
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,200
Here.

60
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,240
{\an5}The pieces of the spear
call to each other.

61
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,480
{\an5}We will be able to use these
to locate the pieces

62
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,760
in the Legion's possession.

63
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,160
That's why we're separating
into two teams.

64
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,480
Mr. Jackson, shall we?

65
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,080
Are you sure bringing out pieces
of the spear was a good idea?

66
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,160
If this goes wrong...

67
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,880
Then the Legion has the entire spear.

68
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,720
So, we have to be careful.

69
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,560
<i>On my way for Legion-watching.</i>

70
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,640
<i>20 seconds.</i>

71
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,880
Well, I thought I'd seen
the last of this place.

72
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,520
Let's not make it a habit.

73
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,520
{\an5}Well, I appear to be
getting considerable

74
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,240
vibrational energy from this.

75
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,800
My old friend, please, forgive me.

76
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,720
<i>Mick.</i>

77
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,520
<i>Mick!</i>

78
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,200
Are you okay?

79
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,000
Am I okay?

80
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,440
Why wouldn't I be okay?

81
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,920
I miss him too.

82
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,480
He blew himself up.

83
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,920
For what?

84
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,360
So the rest of us could live.

85
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,680
Idiot.

86
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,600
Mick, we gotta go.

87
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,480
Look, this is a heist.

88
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,120
{\an5}We have to steal
the other pieces of the spear,

89
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,280
and get out of here.

90
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,080
You think this is what Snart wants?

91
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,360
You waiting around,
so that you can get caught?

92
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,920
Probably not.

93
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,200
Hold on a sec.

94
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,920
That looks like something
you might hide something in.

95
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,520
Yes, it does.

96
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,720
{\an5}Jax and I may have found
the other pieces of the spear.

97
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,960
Standby.

98
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,040
<i>Copy that.</i>

99
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,800
And I've got eyes on Thawne.

100
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,200
He doesn't know we're here.

101
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,120
Your try, Mr. Jackson.

102
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,400
What's your favorite candy?

103
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,440
Jelly beans. Why?

104
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,640
A little transmutation trick me
and Grey have been working on.

105
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,960
{\an5}Both delicious and impressive,
Mr. Jackson.

106
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,920
- We have the rest of the spear.
- Get back to the ship.

107
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,960
<i>We better hurry.
He's on to us. On my way.</i>

108
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,280
Everyone, get the hell out of here.

109
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,760
This can't be happening.

110
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:01,160
They're not smart enough
for this to be happening.

111
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,680
- You get it?
- Indeed.

112
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,320
Gideon, get us out of here.

113
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,080
No!

114
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,160
Piece of cake.

115
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,960
You thought that was easy?

116
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,280
No, I want a piece of cake
and a beer.

117
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,080
Later, where's the spear?

118
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,240
There we go.

119
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,680
- What is that?
- That's power.

120
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,560
The pieces of the spear
are calling to each other.

121
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,720
They long to be whole.

122
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,720
Yep, that just happened.

123
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,800
Well, that's remarkable.

124
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,520
The spear must be composed
of some kind

125
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,000
of magnetized compound
which acts as its own sealant.

126
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,720
No, no, no, don't, don't, don't.

127
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,800
Don't touch it.

128
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,360
Now that the spear is whole,

129
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,920
it will try and lure
each of us to use it.

130
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,320
It will draw on our weaknesses,
our desires, our regrets.

131
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,360
It will promise each of us
that we can remake the world

132
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,920
just as we want it.

133
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Well, what's wrong with that?

134
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,840
What? Oh, come on.

135
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,920
You're all thinking it.

136
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,280
Absolute power corrupts, Mr. Rory.

137
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,920
Even when used
with the best intentions,

138
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,600
which is why I'd attempted
to destroy it.

139
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,920
Well, maybe you didn't
try hard enough.

140
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,720
No, no, no, no, no!

141
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,920
Not on the ship, bro!

142
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,600
You said destroy, so I destroyed.

143
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,040
It's not destroyed.

144
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,120
It's not even charred.

145
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,800
Any harm brought upon
the spear is temporary.

146
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,320
It will always heal itself.

147
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,400
That's why you had to keep
the pieces separated.

148
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,800
Yes, accomplished with much effort
and numerous explosives.

149
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,120
Wait a sec.

150
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,360
There's something written on it.

151
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,760
That's odd.

152
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,200
That wasn't there before.

153
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,800
It must have been revealed
by the flames.

154
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,840
See, I did help.

155
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,160
<i>Natum de sanguine,
perditus a sanguine.</i>

156
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,040
Anyone know Latin?

157
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,720
<i>Natum de sanguine,
perditus a sanguine.</i>

158
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,080
Yes, but what does that mean?

159
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,520
"Born of blood, undone by blood."

160
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,000
And what does that mean?

161
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,360
- It...
- Look, we finally have the spear.

162
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,880
We just need to figure out
what to do with it.

163
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,120
We need to determine
a way to protect it.

164
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,200
You don't.

165
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,480
You destroy it.

166
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,960
Yes, well, I've tried that,
Dr. Heywood.

167
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,640
It is impervious to destruction.

168
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,720
No, it's not.

169
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,880
"Born of blood, undone by blood."

170
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,840
Pretend we're not historians.

171
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,960
"Born of blood"

172
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,120
because the blood of Christ
gave the spear power.

173
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,160
"Undone by blood"
because the blood of Christ

174
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,920
is the only thing
that can destroy it.

175
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,120
Now you're talking.

176
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,120
Gideon, plot a course
for the Crucifixion.

177
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,720
<i>- Yes, Cap...</i>
- Don't you dare, Gideon.

178
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,040
Look, throughout history,
there are certain moments

179
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,120
whose integrity are crucial.

180
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,840
The birth, life, and death
of Jesus Christ

181
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,960
are all such moments.

182
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,560
Any interference,
no matter how miniscule,

183
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,240
could have disastrous consequences
for the time stream.

184
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,000
We cannot go there. Ever.

185
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,080
Look, I understand that,

186
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,120
but if this is the only way
to destroy the spear...

187
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,200
It's not.

188
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,960
It's not the only way.

189
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,800
Now, I'm not a historian,

190
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,800
but I can't imagine it's possible
to obtain the blood of Christ

191
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,880
without Christ.

192
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,480
Actually, it is.

193
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,560
I did a year abroad at Oxford
while working on my Masters,

194
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,200
and in between dating this girl,

195
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:38,720
Wendy, I remember reading
this unpublished paper

196
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,920
by this classics scholar
from early 20th century.

197
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,520
Now, this scholar
had this far-fetched theory

198
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,640
about Sir Gawain,
that the knight returned

199
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,760
from the Crusades
not with the Holy Grail,

200
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,680
but with something far more valuable.

201
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,280
- The blood of Christ.
- Exactly.

202
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,840
Now, the paper went on to theorize
that Gawain had a vial

203
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,640
of this precious substance on him

204
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,680
up to his death
and was buried with it

205
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,360
somewhere in the North of France.

206
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,400
Just somewhere
in the North of France?

207
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,680
That's a big area.

208
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,000
I know, but if anyone and I mean
anyone, knows where to start looking,

209
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,200
it's this guy.

210
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,360
<i>The Burden of the Purest Heart:</i>

211
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,960
<i>Sir Gawain's Secret Treasure,</i>
written by...

212
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,160
John Ronald Reuel Tolkien.

213
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,240
You're kidding.

214
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,480
The guy who wrote <i>The Hobbit</i>
and <i>The Lord of the Rings.</i>

215
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,200
<i>John Tolkien was
in the North of France in 1916</i>

216
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:37,160
<i>during the Battle of the Somme
as a Second Lieutenant</i>

217
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,400
<i>in World War I.</i>

218
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,120
Well, looks like
we're going back to war.

219
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,520
Temper, temper.

220
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,200
Don't test me, Damien!

221
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,840
Shouldn't it be the other way around?

222
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,040
You sent me and Malcolm off
to find the Kalabros Manuscript

223
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,480
while the Legends managed to abscond
with the Spear of Destiny.

224
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,280
I should have that zombie Speedster
you're so afraid of eat your brain.

225
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,160
No.

226
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,360
No, this is actually
a positive development.

227
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,360
Or maybe he already has.

228
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,960
With the entire spear
in the Legends' possession,

229
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,600
we no longer have to keep going
after it piecemeal.

230
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,560
Yeah, I'm a glass half-full
kind of guy...

231
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,600
The legendary idiots
won't be able to use it.

232
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,400
They'll either try to hide it
or destroy it,

233
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,520
and when they do,
we'll be there, waiting.

234
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,640
No.

235
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,600
- Excuse me?
- Not just us.

236
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,120
I'm not sure if you're keeping score,
Eobard, but we're losing.

237
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,880
So, it's time to change the game.

238
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,040
All right, we gotta be careful.

239
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,320
The Battle of the Somme
was one of the bloodiest conflicts

240
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,680
in human history.

241
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,280
- Sounds terrible. I'm in.
- We're all in.

242
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,480
It's not gonna be easy
finding Tolkien in this mess.

243
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,080
<i>According to military records,</i>

244
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,640
<i>Second Lieutenant Tolkien
contracted trench fever</i>

245
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,480
<i>and was transferred
to a first aid outpost</i>

246
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,400
<i>to await transportation
back to Britain.</i>

247
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,480
Perfect.

248
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:06,040
Amaya, take the Backstreet Boys,
intercept Tolkien,

249
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,200
find out what he knows,
send him on his way.

250
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,680
So what'd you want us to do?

251
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,360
Guard the spear.

252
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,400
Somebody has to be
with the spear at all times.

253
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,760
Indeed, now that the spear
has been reconstituted,

254
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,520
the stakes have never been greater.

255
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,640
Which is why I should stay
on the ship too.

256
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,360
You okay?

257
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,520
I'm fine.

258
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,880
All right, in that case,
go with the guys.

259
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,360
They could use the adult supervision.

260
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,920
We're at the outpost.

261
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,880
God, it's a madhouse.

262
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,160
Fan out to cover more ground.

263
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,480
Stay on the coms and be careful.

264
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,280
Yeah, Gideon said Tolkien was ill.

265
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,920
We should search amongst the injured.

266
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,840
Mr. Rory, Ms. Jiwe,
you go look in triage.

267
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,120
Let me guess.

268
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,600
We get the fun part?

269
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,520
I've always wanted
to visit the Somme.

270
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,680
Just without, you know,
all the warfare going on.

271
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,400
Amaya, any sign of Tolkien?

272
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,880
I... I don't know.

273
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,240
There's so much suffering.

274
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,400
So many injured.

275
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,080
Miss, please, help me.

276
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,560
Just try to stay still.

277
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,480
Let me see what we're dealing with.

278
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,160
Nurse, change these bandages,
will you?

279
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,800
I don't want to die alone.

280
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,960
You won't.

281
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,240
Here.

282
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,880
Hey, those are for them.

283
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:24,200
My, my, my,
how the mighty have fallen.

284
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,480
You said that the last time
you appeared.

285
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,280
You pick a hell of a time to show up.

286
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,920
I'm kind of in the middle
of something.

287
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Yeah, in the middle of being
a good little doggie

288
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:36,000
to those insufferable wannabes.

289
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,400
Stay on mission, now.

290
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,040
Gotta find this hobbit guy.

291
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,160
J.R.R. Tolkien, why?

292
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,520
Hoping for an autograph?

293
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,960
I don't even know who that guy is.

294
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,800
All I know is I gotta find
this hobbit guy

295
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,560
who knows the guy
who's buried with Jesus' blood.

296
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,800
Then we can destroy
the Spear of Destiny.

297
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,960
Mick, Mick, Mick, when have
we ever destroyed anything

298
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,040
we've ever stolen, let alone
the most valuable score

299
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,120
in the universe?

300
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,160
What have they done to you?

301
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,080
How the hell are we supposed
to find anyone in here?

302
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,880
- What?
- I said, how the hell are we sup...

303
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,280
On your feet,
you lazy good-for-nothings,

304
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,520
or I'll have you shot!

305
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,880
Did you hear me, Lieutenant?

306
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,800
Yes, sir.

307
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,200
On your feet with your weapon,
you fool of a Tolkien!

308
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,280
On your feet!

309
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,600
Tolkien, Lieutenant Tolkien?

310
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,520
Yes, yes, that's me.

311
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,120
He's very ill.
He's gotta come with us.

312
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,320
Nonsense, I... I'm perfectly fine.

313
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,560
This man is burning with a fever.

314
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,000
We're taking him out of here now!

315
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,520
Well, get him to the field hospital.

316
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,400
Come on, you trench rats!

317
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,920
The boys have a date
with your bitter steel!

318
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,880
We have him,
but he's in no condition to talk.

319
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,880
All right, get him
to the extraction point.

320
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,960
- We'll meet you there.
- Mr. Rory?

321
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,840
<i>Steal us an ambulance, will you?</i>

322
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,920
On it.

323
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,040
What happened to the man
who never took orders from anyone?

324
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,040
I respected the hell out of that guy.

325
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,760
Now you're just their trained pet.

326
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,320
Sit, Mick. Fetch, Mick.

327
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,000
Good boy, Mick. Woof!

328
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,800
I'm no one's pet.

329
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,040
Sure you are.

330
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,600
They may act all friendly to you,
but they'll never trust you, never.

331
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,840
When the chips are down,
they'll look at you the same way

332
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,840
they always have, as a thug.

333
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,200
But you and me?

334
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,200
We're partners.

335
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,600
At least, we were and could be again.

336
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,040
Take the Spear of Destiny, Mick.
Use it for yourself.

337
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,720
- Use it for us.
- There is no us.

338
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,440
- You're dead.
- I don't have to be, Mick.

339
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,400
With the spear,
it'd be so easy to bring me back.

340
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,520
You're in my head.
You're a, you're an illumination.

341
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,840
- A hallucination.
- That's it.

342
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,440
Now, did that feel like
a hallucination?

343
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,320
I must be hallucinating.

344
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,440
Actually, we took the liberty
of curing your typhoid fever,

345
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,800
Lieutenant Tolkien.

346
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:09,880
You.

347
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,160
I knew you weren't volunteers.

348
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,400
Your accent alone was horrendous.

349
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,040
I'll have you know I played Bert

350
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,520
in my middle school production
of <i>Mary Poppins,</i> thank you.

351
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,520
Who are you, then? German?

352
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,360
Ottoman?

353
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,120
And where on God's Earth
have you brought me?

354
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,840
Somewhere the less talked
about, the better, for your sake.

355
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,760
But we're on your side,
and we need your help.

356
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,520
In your paper,
<i>The Burden of the Purest Heart,</i>

357
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,720
you described the final resting place
of Sir Gawain.

358
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,040
I never actually published
that paper, how did you...

359
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,640
It's hard to explain,
but we need to know

360
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,120
where the knight is buried.

361
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,920
You abducted me
from the middle of a battlefield

362
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,280
to ask about an old myth?

363
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,960
There is a war on, you fools!

364
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,320
And I imagine that the view
from the trenches is pretty bleak.

365
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,760
It looks to me
like the end of the world.

366
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,840
But it's not.

367
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,600
Believe me, this darkness will pass.

368
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,720
You speak as someone
who's seen the future.

369
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,560
Haven't all students of history?

370
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,680
Those who suffer heal.

371
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,520
Everything destroyed gets rebuilt.

372
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,880
And our towers grow
a little taller every time.

373
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,240
I should like to believe you.

374
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,160
Tell me, why do you seek
the grave of Gawain?

375
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,040
It's a long story.

376
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,440
I enjoy long stories.

377
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,640
Yeah, he does.

378
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,840
In short,
my fellow travelers and I...

379
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,080
Fellowship, if you will.

380
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,800
We're on a journey
to destroy an object.

381
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,640
One which would bring
the bearer unimaginable power.

382
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,640
Have you heard
of the Spear of Destiny?

383
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,760
I came across numerous obscure
references to it in my studies.

384
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,960
Of course, such a divine artifact
could never actually exist.

385
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,040
But it does.

386
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,760
And we need your help
to end its threat.

387
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,480
I left all my research at Oxford.

388
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,400
To help you,
I would need a vast library.

389
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,160
Well, lucky for you, we brought one.

390
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,000
How'd it go out there?

391
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:06,640
Amaya?

392
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,400
It was worse than any nightmare.

393
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,160
You've seen this before.

394
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,840
In World War II, it's definitely
a situation where the sequel

395
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,400
was worse than the original.

396
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,200
What changed?

397
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:29,200
I had Gideon show me
the historical record.

398
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,600
My future.

399
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,760
How much did you see?

400
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,520
My village burned to the ground.

401
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,560
My daughter turned into a refugee.

402
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:44,840
And her daughter turned
into an orphan.

403
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,080
Seeing the battlefield today,
it just made it so real.

404
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,680
I'm so sorry.

405
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,760
But, if it helps...

406
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,760
from what my sister told me,...

407
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,360
despite all the pain
and suffering your granddaughter

408
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,440
will endure...

409
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,600
She turns out to be
a pretty remarkable person.

410
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,760
A hero.

411
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,480
Don't even think about it!

412
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,000
That is not a scratcher
of any variety.

413
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,360
What happened to your face?

414
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,960
I saw Snart again.

415
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,040
More likely, you took a nasty blow
on the battlefield.

416
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,760
Perhaps you're suffering
some minor brain damage

417
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,160
or, at least, more brain damage.

418
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,640
Snart did this!

419
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,760
I believe you.

420
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,520
- You do?
- Of course not.

421
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,120
I just don't want you to hurt me.

422
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,520
But, given our trip
to the Vanishing Point,

423
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,840
it would make sense
that he'd be in your thoughts.

424
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,040
Mick, let him go.

425
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,400
You're going to church.

426
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,440
I'm not the religious type.

427
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,280
Tolkien's located
Gawain's burial place.

428
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,320
It's in a cathedral in Amiens.

429
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,480
If it's still there.

430
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,840
The war's already passed through.

431
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,800
- Are you sure you're up for this?
- Yes.

432
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,000
Snart, he...

433
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,720
he's in my head, right?

434
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,600
The Church of Amiens.

435
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:34,200
Built in the 1600s, for centuries,
it was a shelter, a refuge.

436
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,520
Now just a place
for marauding armies to squat.

437
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,120
Look closely, but be careful.

438
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,440
Returning knights of the Crusades
were known to hide their relics

439
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,600
so only the worthy could find them.

440
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:48,160
They set traps for those
who aren't so worthy.

441
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,120
They're so close,
finishing each others' dire warnings.

442
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,360
I think I found something.

443
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,360
It's gotta be worth a fortune.

444
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,800
- Gold.
- Yeah, don't bite the relics.

445
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,240
- Give me that.
- And don't steal the relics.

446
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,240
Now, if I'm not mistaken,
the inscription's written in...

447
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,000
Proto-Celtic.

448
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,720
It says, "Follow the outlier,
then push further still."

449
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,440
But what is the outlier?

450
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,960
Three rubies, one emerald.

451
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,600
I think I found our outlier.

452
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,280
"Then push further still."

453
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,880
This structure's been damaged
from all the fighting.

454
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,560
Sir Gawain, I presume.

455
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:52,840
Hey, look, on his shield,
it's an engraving.

456
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,600
Pretty pathetic, if you ask me.

457
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,160
Mr. Snart?

458
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,320
Wait, you can see him?

459
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,200
You're supposed to be dead.

460
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,400
Yeah, they told me
all about how I get soft

461
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,520
and die for you losers.

462
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,640
I didn't believe them.

463
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,720
Believe who?

464
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:19,360
Well, if that's not an entrance line,
I don't know what is.

465
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,760
What is going on here?

466
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,080
The Legion must have traveled
back in time

467
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,760
and picked up Mr. Snart
before he joined the Legends.

468
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,240
He told us all about your plan

469
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,360
on how you're going
to destroy the spear.

470
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,800
Thanks for the tip, Mick.

471
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,400
I didn't think he was real.

472
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,120
No, no, no, no.
No need to defend yourself.

473
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,720
Actually, there is.

474
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,920
Angriff!

475
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,600
Get behind me!

476
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,040
What is this madness?

477
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,600
What are you?

478
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,160
What are you doing? We gotta go!

479
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,840
Not without the engraving!

480
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,560
You actually care about these losers.

481
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,280
Mick, come on, let's go!

482
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,160
Because I guarantee
they don't care about you, Mick.

483
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,160
So, Snart's alive.

484
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,840
And he's working with the Legion.

485
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,160
Well, it's not just the Legion,
is it, Mick?

486
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,480
You got something to say to me?

487
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:32,080
You told him about our plan
to destroy the spear.

488
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,040
Well, I thought I was seeing things.

489
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,680
Whether Mr. Snart
was a hallucination or not,

490
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,360
the fact that you told him
about our plan speaks volumes.

491
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,240
Volumes of what, Professor?

492
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,240
I think what Martin is trying
to say is that he's worried

493
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,120
that, if it came down to a decision
between Leonard and us...

494
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,400
You would choose Snart
in a heartbeat.

495
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,520
Yeah, I would.

496
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,760
He's a friend, and you guys ain't
exactly being friendly right now.

497
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,240
Can you blame us?

498
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,400
We're concerned
that your blunder with Mr. Snart

499
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,280
confirms that you haven't
truly given up

500
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,920
your roots as a thug.

501
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,840
That what you think, Captain?

502
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,800
Mick, we just need you to be careful.

503
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,880
Why?

504
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,200
Oh, I see.

505
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:22,960
In your eyes,
I'm always gonna be a criminal.

506
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,760
This is fascinating.

507
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,640
Apparently, the spear will glow
in the presence of divine blood.

508
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,720
Yeah, and it also revealed
the message when Mick lit it on fire.

509
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,440
A secret only fire can tell.

510
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,200
How marvelous.

511
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,040
So, unless you wanna
wander all over France

512
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,280
waiting for this thing to light up,
I suggest we figure out this map.

513
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,320
You okay?

514
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,760
I'm afraid I suffer
from what is known

515
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,800
in the trenches as "shell shock,"

516
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,960
although some would prefer
to call it "common cowardice."

517
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,480
Said the guy who dodged bullets
to get a grave rubbing.

518
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,560
Give me a break.

519
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,200
Proof I belong in a library,
and not on a...

520
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,040
battlefield.

521
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,640
I know where we have to go
to destroy the spear.

522
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,720
Where?

523
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,560
The middle of hell on Earth.

524
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,040
You hear them too, huh?

525
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,840
I'm sorry?

526
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,720
The voices.

527
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,360
What's the spear saying to you?

528
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,600
It's not the spear. It's my mother.

529
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,760
Her voice, at least.

530
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,040
She's begging me to help our people.

531
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,600
To keep our family
and our legacy safe.

532
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,400
She wants me to change my destiny.

533
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,400
Maybe the spear can do that for her.

534
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,800
The chance to rewrite reality.

535
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,960
Who wouldn't be tempted?

536
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,960
What do you hear?

537
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,960
My parents.

538
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,960
What are they saying?

539
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,880
"Don't play with fire, Mick."

540
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,720
Mick, Amaya, I need you in here.

541
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,760
So, it looks like our historians
have made a discovery.

542
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,080
According to this map,

543
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,120
the blood of Christ
is hidden right smack

544
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,480
in the middle of no-man's land.

545
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,800
Great, right at the center
of the bloodiest battle

546
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,880
in human history.

547
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,080
Even if we were to make it
through the terrain unscathed,

548
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,800
there's still the issue
of the blood's precise location.

549
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,960
That's the good news.

550
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:41,320
Just as the spear acted
as a diving rod for its pieces,

551
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,040
it glows when it's close
to Jesus' blood.

552
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,440
But one cannot simply walk
into the middle of a war zone.

553
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,560
What if we convinced
both sides to stop fighting

554
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,320
long enough for us to get in there?

555
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,480
That'll never work.

556
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,000
But there is another way.

557
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,440
We can rewrite reality.

558
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,880
Eliminate the threat of the Legion
once and for all time.

559
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,080
No, we can't.

560
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,280
This is just a tool.

561
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,760
In the right hands, in our hands,
we can use it for good.

562
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,840
But the spear has more power
than any of us could possibly wield.

563
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,760
I know a thing or two
about wielding mystical artifacts.

564
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,720
I can control it.

565
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:20,840
Look, a totem is one thing,
but that, that is more powerful

566
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,120
than anything any of us have seen.

567
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,640
She said she can handle it.

568
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,160
Mick, not now.

569
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,680
Amaya, look, you don't know
what the spear can do to you.

570
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,760
Having the ability
to rewrite your own reality,

571
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:35,440
it's too much temptation for anyone.

572
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,640
That's why we have to do
this the hard way.

573
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,720
All right, hard way it is.

574
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,520
I'm in.

575
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,840
Yeah, I'm down.

576
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,080
It's the right thing to do.

577
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,800
Obviously, I've been outvoted.

578
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,400
I will help you
in whatever way I can.

579
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,200
But I think you're making
a huge mistake.

580
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,440
Incoming!

581
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,200
Coming through! Coming through!

582
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:20,160
According to this map, Jesus' blood
is somewhere over there.

583
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,240
The spear is sensing the blood.

584
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,000
We won't last five minutes out there.

585
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,240
It's not too late to use it.

586
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,080
Loser.

587
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,320
Commander, we may request
a moment of your time.

588
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,480
We are in the midst of battle.

589
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,400
There are no moments,
Lieutenant Tolkien.

590
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,200
I was told you were suffering
from trench fever,

591
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,000
and you better be,
or else I report you as a deserter.

592
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,440
Captain Hunter,
Royal Army Medical Corps.

593
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,000
Now, I can assure you
that this man is no deserter.

594
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,760
As such, we have an urgent entreaty.

595
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,480
We need you to contact German
command and request a ceasefire.

596
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,920
How dare you waste my time?

597
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,160
We're on the verge
of taking Guillemont.

598
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,680
Guillemont can wait.

599
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:05,960
There is a greater battle at hand,
one that concerns all of humanity.

600
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,040
Both sides must lay down their arms,
or all shall be lost.

601
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:13,240
Sir, latest casualty report.

602
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,840
Twenty-three hundred dead.

603
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,480
Nearly 8,000 wounded.

604
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:23,280
All has already been lost.

605
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,880
Perhaps, our friends
on the Germans' side

606
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,080
are having more luck.

607
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,160
You wish for me
to order our artillery

608
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,080
to stop shelling the enemy?

609
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,240
Just long enough
for us to rescue the wounded

610
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,320
from the battlefield.

611
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,200
And so the British can rescue theirs.

612
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,600
I will order our batteries
to stop firing

613
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,240
when they stop firing on us.

614
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,040
It seems neither side
wants to give up the fight.

615
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,080
We don't have time,
not with the Legion on our tails.

616
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,480
We have to push forward.

617
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,160
Advance, soldiers!

618
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,800
Up the ladders,
over the top, let's go!

619
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,560
The British are advancing.

620
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,200
Now's our best chance to move.

621
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,280
It's all on us now.

622
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,320
Watch each others' backs,
and we'll make it to the ship alive.

623
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,480
Understood?

624
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,760
We're getting closer!

625
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,480
What is it with me and Nazis?

626
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,840
Wrong World War, Mick!

627
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,520
These are Huns, not Nazis!

628
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,960
I don't care
what you wanna call them,

629
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,280
just take them out, now!

630
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,360
<i>I'm on it.</i>

631
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,840
We must be almost on top of it.

632
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,240
That way.

633
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,640
Sir, you need to understand
that this is one problem

634
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,320
that cannot be solved with violence.

635
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,040
Okay, maybe a spot of violence.

636
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,440
Well, if he's not gonna give
the order for the ceasefire,

637
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,840
we'll have to.

638
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,640
What frequency are we on?

639
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,720
Three megahertz.

640
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,880
Jax, set the Waverider
to receive the signal

641
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,160
and hijack all communication
on the battlefield.

642
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,640
Copy that, pumping the volume.

643
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,440
<i>Attention all combatants.</i>

644
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,520
<i>May I have your attention, please?</i>

645
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,640
<i>There are casualties
on the battlefield.</i>

646
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,680
Brave men on both sides

647
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,040
who are in urgent need
of medical attention.

648
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,720
<i>I know that the divisions
between us run deep,</i>

649
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,680
<i>that they may very well
be insurmountable.</i>

650
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:26,600
But I implore both of our armies
for this one moment

651
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,560
<i>to come together as allies
and honor a ceasefire</i>

652
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,800
so that the injured may be removed
from the field of battle.

653
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,720
<i>There may come a day
when our courage fails us...</i>

654
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,080
when we forsake our friendships

655
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:49,680
and break the bonds of fellowship,
but today is not that day.

656
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,560
And perhaps
in showing our humanity...

657
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,560
We might just save it.

658
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,120
It worked.

659
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,800
I can't believe they fell for it.

660
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,400
Let's keep moving.

661
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,000
That's gotta be it.

662
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:48,560
Tolkien was right.

663
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,200
The legend's real.

664
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,280
It's the blood of...

665
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,520
Christ, you are so predictable.

666
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,000
Though, I have to admit,
negotiating a ceasefire

667
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,480
in the middle of a World War?

668
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,640
Pretty impressive.

669
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,320
Maybe they'd like to hear
our peace terms.

670
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,120
It's quite simple, really.

671
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:09,120
Hand over the spear, or we kill you.

672
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,520
Sorry, Captain, but you've reached
the end of your quest.

673
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,880
You're right.

674
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,160
I'm gonna end this now.
Mick, give me the spear.

675
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,960
- Mick.
- What are you doing?

676
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,520
Hey, man, we're your friends.

677
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,920
I don't have friends.

678
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
But he does have partners.

679
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,320
So, what do you say, partner?

680
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,440
Mick, you're better than this.

681
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,160
No, actually, you're not.

682
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,520
They may pretend to believe in
you as long as they can use you,

683
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,160
but they'll just as soon let you die,
same as they did me.

684
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,920
He's messing with your head, man.

685
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,040
Ever since I've been on that ship,

686
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,480
you people have been
trying to change me.

687
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,000
That's not true, Mick.

688
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,440
But guess what?

689
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,160
There are things about me
I wanna change too.

690
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,200
Steel up, Nate. Stop him.

691
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,640
He does, you and animal chick die,
but we still keep the spear.

692
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:12,080
And we're gonna make
all kinds of fun changes.

693
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,760
You bastard.

694
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:14,960
Come with me.

695
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,480
The spear can help us fix your
messed up future and my past.

696
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,440
Never.

697
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,320
If you think we're gonna
let you walk out of here

698
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,520
- with the spear...
- You're right.

699
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,040
You know, we could use a distraction.

700
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:35,040
I hereby declare
that the armistice is over.

701
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,160
Get down!

702
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,200
Oh, that's just great.

703
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,520
Now, we're all gonna die.

704
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:54,200
Mick, have I ever pulled a heist
without a getaway plan?

705
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,640
I wish things could've
been different, Sara.

706
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,320
Get down!

707
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,320
Jax, we need an extraction.

708
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,400
Go!

709
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,680
Copy that, I'm in bound.

710
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,720
Okay, opening the cargo bay doors.

711
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,200
Let's go!

712
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,920
Amaya!

713
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,280
Mick's gone. It's over.

714
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,720
We never should have set foot
on that battlefield.

715
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,400
We didn't have a choice.

716
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,000
That's not true.

717
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:22,040
There was a choice,
and you made the wrong one,

718
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:25,000
and now the Spear of Destiny,
the most powerful weapon

719
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,640
in all of history,
is in the hands of not one,

720
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,240
but four psychopaths.

721
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,160
Don't forget Mr. Rory.

722
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,440
That's right.

723
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,760
We trusted him,
and he screwed us over.

724
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,080
Did we trust him?

725
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,960
I mean, admit it,
we never really did,

726
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,120
and he picked up on it.

727
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,800
Yeah, apparently Mr. Rory's
not entirely stupid.

728
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,320
We lied to him.

729
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,920
Not Mick, Tolkien.
We told him there was hope.

730
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,760
That humanity will light
its way, but...

731
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,480
we just ended up dumping him
back in the trenches.

732
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,160
We had to restore time.

733
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,600
Although I suppose
it doesn't really much matter

734
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,520
now that reality itself
is threatened.

735
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,800
Maybe not.

736
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,520
Last time I checked,
there was not an on/off button

737
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,600
on the spear.

738
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,200
What if...

739
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,680
what if they don't know
how to use it?

740
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,720
I have to say, well done.

741
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,000
I've heard of your skills
as a thief before,

742
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:35,160
but this has taken it
to a whole new level.

743
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:39,080
Truly masterful, getting
one of them to steal it for us.

744
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,000
He was never really one of them.

745
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,080
Were you, Mick?

746
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:46,080
I thought you said
the spear belonged to us.

747
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,080
There's plenty of power to go around.

748
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,600
Thanks for waiting for me.

749
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,120
Seems like I missed a few things.

750
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,400
You found the Kalabros.

751
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,800
The word of God himself.

752
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,680
It's like the owner's manual
for the Spear of Destiny.

753
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,360
It wasn't easy to find.

754
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:01,440
Now what?

755
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Grab hold.
