1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:02,200
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,400
- Who are you?
- Oh, my word.

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,920
Please, don't hurt me.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
We caught a spy!

5
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,280
- Ivy?
- Marv!

6
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:09,640
No!

7
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,720
Watch out!

8
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,720
Ivy?

9
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,520
<i>Gotham listens to me.</i>

10
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,640
<i>It's time to round up our friends.</i>

11
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,360
<i>Former war hero.</i>

12
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,320
<i>Former white knight cop.
Now bounty hunter.</i>

13
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,920
<i>Saving Gotham's not my job anymore.</i>

14
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,400
<i>You are a cop in everything but name.</i>

15
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,520
Who the hell are you, Jim Gordon?

16
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,600
- What are you doing?
- Shut up for once.

17
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,640
When I count to three,

18
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,640
you will all awake and have no
memory of your animal identity.

19
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,720
One, two, three.

20
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,760
Thank you. Thank you.

21
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,680
A magician? Really?

22
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,040
Hypnotist.

23
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,280
I like him.

24
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,800
Plus, the place is packed. Be happy.

25
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,400
Just a taste, ladies and gentlemen.

26
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:24,160
But now, let us venture
into something more arcane.

27
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,400
I'll need a single volunteer.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You, sir.

29
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,320
- Beautiful suit.
- Thank you.

30
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,280
- A lawyer?
- Doctor.

31
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,120
- Your mistress?
- My... my wife.

32
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,200
Oh, delightful.

33
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,600
Listen to the watch.

34
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,920
The way its ticking synchronizes
with your heartbeat.

35
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,280
Look into my eyes.

36
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,880
Not above them, not around them
but deep into their center.

37
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,800
You are completely relaxed
and are becoming weightless.

38
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,360
Are you ready to do
something impossible?

39
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,160
Yes.

40
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,680
Stand upon the chair.

41
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,080
No, the back of it.

42
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,080
Remember, you weigh nothing at all.

43
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,360
- He'll fall!
- Not at all, my dear.

44
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,920
In a hypnotic state,
unburdened by doubt and fear,

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,120
we can accomplish the impossible.

46
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,160
Now, one foot.

47
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,400
So you could get him to do
anything you wanted?

48
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,560
Did you have something in mind,
Miss Kean?

49
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,480
Jump down, sir.

50
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,520
Lock sense away, awaken the rascal.

51
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,640
When I say it is so,
your home is my castle.

52
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,880
Now, I'm going to count down
and clap my hands and you will awake.

53
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,880
Three, two, one.

54
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,040
How do you feel, sir?

55
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,880
I feel great.

56
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,360
Thank you!

57
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,520
Thank you.

58
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,720
Very impressive, Mr. Tetch.

59
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,400
You have quite the gift.

60
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,400
But you didn't answer my question.

61
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,200
Can you make people do anything
you tell them to do?

62
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,680
Only things they secretly wish to do.

63
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,880
It's surprising what people wish for,
secretly.

64
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,680
Deep down.

65
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:01,800
True. You must be a very popular man.

66
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,880
Oh. I wish.

67
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:06,280
Parties like this help pay my way,
so thank you.

68
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,840
And you're new to Gotham?

69
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,600
Yes, just arrived from up north.

70
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,720
- You have a place to stay?
- Not yet.

71
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,560
But something always seems
to turn up.

72
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,160
{\an5}This is weird for me, too.

73
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,240
{\an5}- What's, what's your name?
- Five.

74
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,840
{\an5}Five One Four A.
But they call me Five.

75
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,640
{\an5}- At Indian Hill?
- Yes.

76
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,480
{\an5}- And how about before that?
- I don't... I don't remember...

77
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,880
{\an5}I don't remember anything
before that.

78
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,040
{\an5}Well, that's convenient isn't it?
I mean, nothing?

79
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,160
{\an5}I mean, you must've had a home,
family, friends?

80
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,960
- Parents?
- If I did, I can't remember.

81
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,760
{\an5}I woke up in that lab
over a year ago.

82
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,120
{\an5}I was locked up the whole time
I was there.

83
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:06,240
{\an5}They gave me books,
did tests on me many tests.

84
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,040
{\an5}I heard the other inmates
in the halls but I never saw them.

85
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,040
{\an5}Not until Miss Mooney broke us out.

86
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,680
{\an5}I'm sorry I surprised you
by coming here

87
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,760
but when I saw you,
I had to meet you.

88
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,440
{\an5}You "saw" me?

89
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,320
{\an5}On the rooftop, with that girl.

90
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,680
{\an5}Selina.

91
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,920
{\an5}She gave me money, I followed her.

92
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,040
{\an5}You're welcome to stay here
as long as you need.

93
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,880
{\an5}Or perhaps we should contact someone

94
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,160
{\an5}with more expertise in these matters,
Master Bruce.

95
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,240
{\an5}It's late.

96
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:42,040
{\an5}That can wait until tomorrow,
we'll make up one of the guest rooms.

97
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,680
{\an5}Master Bruce, we have to get rid
of that thing, as quick as possible.

98
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,800
{\an5}He's a human being, Alfred.
He's in need of help.

99
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,280
{\an5}Look, I understand you feel sorry
for the boy

100
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,000
but have a butcher's at him,
will you?

101
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,560
{\an5}I mean, he's you.
Hugo Strange made another you.

102
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,680
I reckon this was something to do

103
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,960
with that secret society
or something.

104
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,720
{\an5}So, what do we do,
throw him back on the street?

105
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,720
{\an5}I want to know who and what
and why as much as you do, Alfred.

106
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,400
{\an5}Better he stays here
until we find out.

107
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,960
{\an5}Fine but tomorrow,
we call Lucius Fox.

108
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,200
{\an5}Maybe he'll know what to do with it.
I mean, him.

109
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,920
- Valerie.
- James.

110
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,240
You want some breakfast?

111
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,800
There's a place around the corner.

112
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,520
Pass. I have to be
at City Hall in an hour.

113
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,080
I have to go home and shower.

114
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,320
I have a shower.

115
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,960
No, you have a dark hole in the wall

116
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,000
with no water pressure
and one damp towel.

117
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,360
Right.

118
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,280
Well, I'm collecting my bounty
from the GCPD today,

119
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:02,080
so I can stop on my way home,
make things a little...

120
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,560
nicer.

121
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,480
Yeah, good luck with that.

122
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,760
That was fun.

123
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,600
See you around.

124
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,720
Okay. See you.

125
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,800
I'm not gonna get all misty-eyed
but the simple truth is,

126
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,800
this department has missed you.

127
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,440
God-given talent like yours
is hard to find.

128
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,000
Your expertise and your
professionalism is exemplary.

129
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,720
I'm very pleased
that you're returning to the GCPD.

130
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,360
Where else can you make a difference
like this?

131
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,440
Nowhere.

132
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,840
I know. It's not that.

133
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,800
Look, now forgive me if I'm...

134
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,120
stepping into a delicate minefield

135
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,320
but if what you're worried
about is Jim Gordon,

136
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,520
he no longer works here.

137
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,360
No GCPD affiliation whatsoever.

138
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,920
<i>I wanna use my phone call, huh?</i>

139
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,320
Hey, Harvey.

140
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,800
Jim. Buddy, pal.

141
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,960
Let's get a cup of coffee.

142
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,800
I just came by for my check.

143
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,040
City still owes me for bringing
in the last of Strange's creeps.

144
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,400
- Yeah, you mean, Osw...
- Jim?

145
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,600
Hello, Jim.

146
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,800
What... what are you...

147
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,840
Hey. You look well.

148
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,560
Thanks.

149
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,360
You visiting?

150
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,040
No, we're...

151
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,480
I'm... I'm moving here, permanently.

152
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,520
With my fiancé.

153
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,800
He's been offered head trauma
position at Gotham General.

154
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,480
A doctor. Good call.

155
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,200
Captain Barnes has been nice enough
to offer me my old job back.

156
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,280
Here.

157
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,240
I haven't decided, yet.

158
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,480
Well, if you did, you'd see me.

159
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,200
I'm here now and again, getting paid.

160
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,120
It's good to see you, Lee.

161
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,040
I guess I better get going,
the movers are due any minute.

162
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
Be well, Jim.

163
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,520
Jim.

164
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,800
Where's my money, Harvey?

165
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,040
Hello?

166
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,600
<i>Lock sense away, awaken the rascal.</i>

167
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,440
<i>When I say it is so,
your home is my castle.</i>

168
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,840
<i>Go to the door.</i>

169
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,280
Honey?

170
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,600
Who are you?

171
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,720
Who am I?

172
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,960
I haunt your dreams like a ghost.

173
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,120
For I know what scares you most.

174
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,000
So, you run, run
as fast as you can...

175
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:23,200
There's no escape from the magic man.

176
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,000
Jolly good.

177
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:34,400
Now, get some plastic, wrap her up
and bury her in the garden.

178
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,600
Oh. And I'm gonna need you
to kill yourself, too.

179
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,680
Chop, chop.

180
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,280
My sweet sister, Alice.

181
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,840
I've travelled so far.

182
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:05,160
So, come out, come out,
wherever you are.

183
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,200
Alice! Hey, Alice!

184
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,720
This time, no excuses.

185
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,760
My money, where is it?

186
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,280
I'll get it for you.

187
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,920
You said that last week
and the week before that.

188
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,280
I should have known,
you're a liar, a cheat.

189
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,640
- I lost my job.
- Then get another.

190
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,600
Don't cheat me!

191
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:48,000
But perhaps,
we work something out, eh?

192
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,960
If you're a nice girl.

193
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,920
Are you a nice girl?

194
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,080
- Stay away from me.
- Oh, be nice to me.

195
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,280
Stop. You don't understand.

196
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,360
Be nice...

197
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,520
I'm so sorry.

198
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,120
You shouldn't have done that.

199
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,000
You brought this on yourself.

200
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,200
Since the death of Galavan,

201
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,680
the office of mayor has been governed
by the elected officials

202
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,000
you see behind me.

203
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:28,440
This city desperately needs
experienced, seasoned leadership.

204
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,920
And so, in their wisdom,
they have persuaded me,

205
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,240
much against my will,
to resume the office of mayor

206
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,040
until elections can be organized
in the new year.

207
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,120
Stop!

208
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,720
This proceeding is a sham!

209
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,960
- Security, remove this criminal!
- Criminal?

210
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,720
I was jailed illegally
by a corrupt system.

211
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,440
A corrupt system that was put
into place by this man.

212
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:01,120
Who has the audacity to put himself
back into the position

213
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,520
that he brought so much shame
and dishonor to.

214
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,960
How dare you?

215
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,480
No, how dare you waltz up there
and announce yourself mayor?

216
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:14,200
The people demand to have a say
into who will represent them,

217
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,040
who will protect them.

218
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,280
Yeah!

219
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,320
It was I... I alone, who drove out
the monsters that plagued our city.

220
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,000
Oh, please.

221
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,200
Where were you then?

222
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,520
While I faced peril at the hands
of those abominations?

223
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,080
Sir... are you challenging James'
appointment to office?

224
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,840
I most certainly am.

225
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,240
Go get a close-up.

226
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,760
To govern this city,
one should be legally elected,

227
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,560
which is why I, Oswald Cobblepot,

228
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,920
announce my candidacy
for the office of mayor.

229
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,200
And I demand and the people demand,

230
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:58,800
that an emergency election
be held forthwith!

231
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,720
Cobblepot! Cobblepot!

232
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,040
Cobblepot! Cobblepot!

233
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,200
Cobblepot!

234
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,400
Good, that's good. That's good.

235
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,680
No one's tired. No one's tired.

236
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,840
And again.

237
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,000
Good boy.

238
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,600
One more time.

239
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Good morning.

240
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,440
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.

241
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,040
Would you like to try?

242
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,720
I... I don't think
that's a particularly good idea.

243
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,760
- Do you, Master Bruce?
- Come, now, Alfred.

244
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,960
I think a little exercise
before breakfast

245
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,240
might be just what he needs.

246
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,560
Fine.

247
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,960
I'll go easy on you. Pop these on.

248
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,240
Put your hand in.
And the other one, that.

249
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,440
Now step up.

250
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,840
Now, just remember,
let's see what you got.

251
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,960
Now, keep your gloves up.

252
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,080
And protect your chin at all times.

253
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,800
All right? Ready, here we go.

254
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,880
Bosh!

255
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,280
Ready?

256
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,360
Come on.

257
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,000
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
- Absolutely fine.

258
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,600
Let's see if you can do that again.

259
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Here I come.

260
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,480
Bloody hell.

261
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,800
Who taught you how to do that, then?

262
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,080
No one.

263
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,680
If they did, I... I don't remember.

264
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,160
Right, well.

265
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,520
Let's see what you got, sunshine.

266
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,600
Here we go again. Here we go.

267
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,120
Oh, dear.

268
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,840
I'm frightfully sorry.

269
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:35,320
- What for?
- Your nose.

270
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,440
Didn't you feel it?

271
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,160
No.

272
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,440
Should I?

273
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,640
Right, well, I think that's,
quite enough for today.

274
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,720
Don't you, Master Bruce?

275
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,520
Here you are, press that up
against your nose.

276
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,720
All right? Here you go.

277
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,520
Stem the flow.

278
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,160
Good lad.

279
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,200
Well, that's a very nasty scar.

280
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,400
Where'd you get that?
Or can't you remember?

281
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,640
What did they do to you in there?

282
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,760
Good day, Mr. Gordon.

283
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,520
Tea?

284
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,120
- How'd you find me?
- Oh, you're famous, sir.

285
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,120
Your name's in the papers.

286
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,080
The fearless bounty hunter.

287
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,000
I want you to find my sister.

288
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,640
We're very close.

289
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,520
We lost our parents at an early age.

290
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,160
I became her guardian.

291
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,520
But her condition proved too much
for me.

292
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,680
I sought help. The worst kind.

293
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,640
The fiend, Professor Strange.

294
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,000
- "Her condition"?
- Some poison in her blood.

295
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,680
Very rare. Unique, in fact.

296
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,760
He took her in, said she needed
constant supervision.

297
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,200
He wouldn't let me see her.

298
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,640
You go to the police?

299
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,880
Useless.
And this is Gotham, after all.

300
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,760
Years passed and I lost hope.

301
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,040
But then I heard about the breakout.

302
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,240
I assume she escaped with others

303
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,760
but now she's out there,
alone, afraid.

304
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,960
Indian Hill escapees get five grand
from the GCPD.

305
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,480
You able to top that?

306
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,400
I'll double it.

307
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,400
I'll see what I can do.

308
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,160
Thank you very much.

309
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,760
Leave your number.

310
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,240
You've seen so much pain
and tragedy, Mr. Gordon.

311
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,080
I hope it hasn't left you too alone.

312
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:10,600
I'm not being negative.
I'm just saying, it's a big step.

313
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,040
Holy crap.

314
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,400
Headquarters, let me just say
one thing...

315
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,880
Gotham is rife with crime butch.

316
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,640
Who better than a criminal
to clean it up?

317
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,800
Okay.

318
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,760
Look, you know I've faced the worst
Gotham has to offer but politicians?

319
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,440
- They scare me.
- The people of Gotham are with me.

320
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,640
They are scared, which means angry
and who have they got to turn to?

321
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,160
Aubrey James?

322
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:36,120
Please, that man is a hack.

323
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:40,320
This is my opportunity
to create a legacy.

324
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,040
One that my father would be proud of.

325
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,840
- Mr. Cobblepot?
- Oh.

326
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,920
What do you think?

327
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,280
You got my vote.

328
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,600
Mr. Cobblepot? I have Aubrey James,
he'd like to meet you, alone.

329
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,080
What are you looking for?

330
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,240
The scars on your back
are distinctive.

331
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,240
I was hoping to find a reference,
a clue as to why they were made.

332
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,360
- You need to hide.
- What?

333
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,160
She won't understand.

334
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,320
What are you doing?

335
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,280
Homework.

336
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,040
Something wrong?

337
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,480
Ivy's missing.

338
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,720
She'll turn up somewhere.

339
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,440
Doesn't she always?

340
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,400
This time, she fell.

341
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:05,840
And it was a long way down,
into water.

342
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,680
Then maybe she survived.

343
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,200
I got a bad feeling.

344
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,720
No offense but...

345
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,360
it's not like you to care.

346
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,880
She had nothing, that kid.

347
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,680
I was it!

348
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,960
No one else would even talk to her.

349
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,560
I shouldn't give up, right?

350
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,280
Maybe take one more look
at the shelters,

351
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,720
our favorite hiding spots?

352
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,800
Sure.

353
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,120
Good idea.

354
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,960
Will you come with me?

355
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,920
If I had a car,
I could get around much quicker.

356
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,400
I am in... no.

357
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,760
No. Not... not right now.

358
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,840
- I just...
- What?

359
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,880
That's too much to ask?
After everything I've done for you?

360
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,080
Selina, it's not like that.

361
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,160
- I...
- Forget it.

362
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,920
Stupid of me to even come here.

363
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,160
I just... it's just not a good time.

364
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,080
You're a selfish son of a bitch,
you know that, right?

365
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,600
I'm sorry.

366
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,920
I'm sorry.

367
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,800
I'm sorry.

368
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,400
I'm sorry.

369
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,720
Selina!

370
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,120
- What do you want?
- I'm looking for someone.

371
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,200
I think you may have seen her.

372
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,880
And if I have, why would I tell you?

373
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,960
She's in trouble.

374
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,480
And I can pay you.

375
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,080
I don't need your money.

376
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,280
So, what do you need?

377
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,720
Ivy.

378
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,480
She's missing.

379
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,400
- For how long?
- Too long.

380
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,200
Just keep an eye open for her,
would you?

381
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,440
Will do.

382
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,800
She's from Indian Hill.

383
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,880
Yeah.

384
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,440
I saw her with Mooney
but only for a day or two.

385
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,880
Last I heard, she got a job
at The Narrows Bar.

386
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,480
All right. Thanks.

387
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,480
Who the hell are you?

388
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,840
You a cop?

389
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,520
Nope.

390
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,280
Well, if you're looking to rob
the place, you're too late.

391
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,840
Fire took everything I had.

392
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,600
I'm looking for someone.

393
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,400
Her name is Alice.

394
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,720
This some kind of joke?

395
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,600
No. What's funny?

396
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,280
That crazy bitch is the one
who started the fire.

397
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,400
- Why'd she do that?
- How the hell do I know?

398
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,760
Said she cut herself.
"Clean yourself up, then," I say.

399
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,120
"You don't understand," she says.
"My blood is on the counter."

400
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,480
Next thing I know,
the whole damn kitchen's in flames.

401
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,400
Someone's gotta pay for this damage.

402
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,880
You tell me where she is,
my client will pay.

403
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,800
- Who's your client?
- You know where she is?

404
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,840
If I did, would I be talking to you?

405
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,520
Thanks for your time.

406
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,200
I say when we're done.

407
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,160
Time to teach you some manners.

408
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,080
- You had enough?
- Not yet.

409
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,280
Now I have.

410
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,760
Sorry for the delay.

411
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,760
Gotham Friday nights keep us busy.

412
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,560
- How you feeling?
- I'll be fine.

413
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,640
Might want to take your shirt off,
don't want to bloody it up.

414
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,960
James Gordon? The policeman.

415
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,560
Used to be.

416
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,840
I don't need to tell you,
it's gonna hurt a little bit.

417
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,240
Here we go.

418
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,960
Lee speaks very highly of you.

419
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,320
I'm Mario, Lee's fiancé.

420
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,880
That's nice of her.

421
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,120
Look, Jim, I don't know
where your head's at with all this

422
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,600
but I want you to know
that I love her very much.

423
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,600
I'm gonna take good care of her.

424
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,560
Good to know.

425
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,680
- So we're okay?
- Yeah.

426
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,840
Sure.

427
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,960
Why wouldn't we be?
Lee and I are old news.

428
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,200
Water under the bridge.

429
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,320
You won't get any problem from me.

430
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,040
I wish you both nothing but the best.

431
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,680
Thank you.

432
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,160
All done.

433
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,160
But...

434
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,080
you ever were to hurt her...

435
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,360
I'd have to hunt you down
and kill you.

436
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,520
Hey, look, about three days ago,

437
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,760
a girl might have come in here
with burns on her.

438
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,560
Ring any bells? I need an address.

439
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,640
Look familiar?

440
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,800
A public place. Smart.

441
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,800
Knowing your flare for the dramatic,
I felt it necessary.

442
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,160
How flattering.

443
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,240
But why exert myself needlessly?

444
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,320
The public sees me
as a man of action, of change.

445
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,360
You... you are yesterday's sad joke.

446
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,280
While Galavan humiliated this city,
where were you?

447
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,480
In a warehouse
with a box on your head.

448
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,520
You're an unstable lunatic, Penguin

449
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,480
and people are gonna see
right through you.

450
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,880
I've got the judges,
the unions, the GCPD

451
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,560
and a whole team
of legal experts behind me.

452
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,640
What have you got?

453
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,720
I have me.

454
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,640
You're psychotic!

455
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,920
Not this time, Penguin.

456
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,160
My head will not be
put in a box again.

457
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,160
Oh, you. So smart.

458
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,880
Always one step ahead.

459
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,200
Never three.

460
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,680
Relax, I do not want you dead.

461
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,440
Besides, what kind of fun
would an election be

462
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,200
if I were the only candidate, huh?

463
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,000
You're right about one thing, though.

464
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,360
I do need a little help.

465
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,960
And I have just the right person
in mind.

466
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,840
Hello?

467
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:32,640
Hello?

468
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,000
No one lies to me!

469
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,440
Don't lie!

470
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,240
Any of his blood get on you?

471
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,760
No.

472
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,480
Hello, Alice.

473
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,160
I wasn't sure how he turned.

474
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,560
"Turn"? What's wrong with him?

475
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,920
He's infected.

476
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,280
Infected with what?

477
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,640
With me.

478
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,920
Who are you?

479
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,360
Why are you here?

480
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,480
Your brother's looking for you.

481
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,720
He can't find me.

482
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,920
Alice. Alice.

483
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,840
He's gone.

484
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,920
He's taken some of your clothes
and the keys to the Roller.

485
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,400
Cut his hair, too.

486
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,160
To look more like you.

487
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,200
We have to go after him.

488
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:38,840
I'm not sure who scheduled
this meeting, Mr. Cobblepot.

489
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,160
But as you can see,

490
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,200
I have been burdened
with restoring order to this facility

491
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:47,040
and that is no easy task.

492
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,440
A man of your reputation
should not have been sent here

493
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,120
to clean up Strange's wreckage.

494
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,200
- Indeed.
- Get off me!

495
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,720
Let me out!

496
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:59,240
You are aware of my ambitions
for office?

497
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,320
Oh, yeah.

498
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:05,800
Once mayor, I will grant you whatever
position you care to request.

499
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,800
Gotham's Head of Psychiatry,
a chair on Gotham's Board of Health.

500
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,360
In exchange for what, exactly?

501
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,840
Even though my victory is inevitable,

502
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,280
I fear my campaign
is missing one key element.

503
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,120
A colleague of mine
is locked up here, unfairly.

504
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,400
Are you suggesting

505
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,280
I release a convicted criminal
out onto the street?

506
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,520
Well, yes.

507
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,920
For your betterment.

508
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,200
That would take extensive
patient analysis,

509
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,760
probational hearings, appeals.

510
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,880
<i>Lock down is now in full effect.</i>

511
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,360
<i>Repeat.
Lock down is now in full effect.</i>

512
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,120
Of course, there's always plan B.

513
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,040
I give you nothing but I make sure
you remain here forever.

514
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,120
Not as a warden. No.

515
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:56,040
I would see you scrub floors
and empty inmates' latrines.

516
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,240
Oh, no.

517
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,960
- Options.
- Yeah.

518
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,040
Look into my eyes.

519
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:13,680
Not around them, not above them
but into their center.

520
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,880
Now sleep.

521
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:22,680
Now, what would we like to see
the lovely Miss Kean do?

522
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,200
Physical feats?

523
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,760
A trip into her psyche?

524
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,760
She said we needed more whimsy.

525
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:38,240
Barbara, when I count down from
three, you will find me irresistible.

526
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,880
You will be madly in love with me.

527
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:45,680
Three, two, one.

528
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:48,920
Barbara?

529
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,720
- Do you care for me?
- Oh, yes.

530
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,760
Do you love me?

531
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,760
Very much.

532
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,800
But what if I can't feel the same?

533
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,800
- Oh, dear.
- What if I love another?

534
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,320
I'm sorry, Barbara, my dear but...

535
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,960
Three, two, one.

536
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,040
Awake.

537
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:20,680
She's a bit sensitive to rejection.

538
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:26,200
Ladies and gentlemen,
the great Jervis Tetch.

539
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,480
- Did you find her?
- I found her.

540
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,560
Lost her.

541
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,160
She shot a man
and set fire to his body.

542
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,720
Said she had an infection.

543
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,360
Also said she doesn't want anything
to do with you.

544
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,720
You wanna tell me
what the hell is going on?

545
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,440
It's complicated.

546
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,880
My next stop will be the GCPD.

547
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,960
- You can explain it to them.
- Please, don't do that.

548
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,440
Let's talk somewhere private.

549
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,040
Allow me to explain the situation.

550
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,520
So what does Alice have in her blood
that makes it so infectious?

551
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,040
She doesn't look sick to me.

552
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,920
She's not sick.

553
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,200
She's powerful, sir.

554
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,720
Powerful, how?
I need answers, Tetch.

555
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,080
You deserve some.
Do you hear my watch ticking?

556
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,240
- Yeah.
- Listen closer.

557
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:46,120
The ticking, it synchronizes
with your heartbeat, yes?

558
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,640
Look into my eyes.

559
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,120
Not above them or around them,
into their center.

560
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,600
Are you asleep, Jim?

561
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,120
- Yes.
- Show me.

562
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,480
Take out your gun
and put it on the ground.

563
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Good.

564
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,520
Now walk to the edge
and climb onto the wall.

565
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:26,160
Been such a long,
hard road for you, Jim Gordon.

566
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,920
You are so very tired of life,
aren't you?

567
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,240
Yes.

568
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,920
Now you can rest, Jim.

569
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,240
Close your eyes.

570
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,720
Sleep forever.

571
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,760
Deep down, you want to die, Jim.

572
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:02,760
You want to end this miserable,
empty, loveless life.

573
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,680
- Don't you?
- Yes.

574
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,760
Yes.

575
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,480
Let me help you.
I'm going to count to ten.

576
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:13,920
When I reach ten,
you will simply step off the ledge

577
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,640
and you will find everlasting peace.

578
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,200
Ready?

579
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,840
Yes.

580
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,160
One.

581
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
Two.

582
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,840
Three. Four.

583
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,240
- Five.
- Stop!

584
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:32,840
Alice?

585
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,920
Thank God! At last, I found you.

586
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,440
Tell that man to get off the ledge.

587
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,720
Never mind him.

588
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,320
- Put down the gun.
- Mister!

589
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,640
- Get down!
- He can't hear you.

590
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,200
Don't come near me!

591
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,200
Why are you here
if you don't wanna talk?

592
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,720
Put the gun down, Alice.

593
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,920
You're evil.

594
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,880
Leave me alone, or I'll kill you!

595
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,920
But Alice, I love you.

596
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,080
Thank you.

597
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,040
I'm sane?

598
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,160
Absolutely, 100 percent.

599
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,720
I examined you myself.

600
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:52,960
And the murder of Miss Kringle...

601
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,520
Committed while you were insane.

602
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,680
- Officer Dougherty...
- Insane.

603
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,000
- Officer Pinkney...
- Insane.

604
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,440
- And now I'm...
- Sane.

605
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,960
And not responsible

606
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:02,680
for any of the acts perpetrated
during your sickness.

607
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,360
You're a free man, Edward.

608
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,360
Not to look a gift horse in the mouth
but how did you...

609
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,280
Never mind.

610
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,320
Hello, old friend.

611
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,240
You're still thinking
about your meeting with Jim?

612
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,640
No, there's nothing left to say.

613
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,760
It's all in the past now.

614
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,360
It's been less than a year,
I... I think there's plenty to say.

615
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,520
After all you went through with him,

616
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,720
I just need to know that nothing's
left unsaid.

617
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,440
Well, you should speak to him
yourself, then.

618
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,800
I did.

619
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,080
You did?

620
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,480
Something you could have mentioned
the moment we sat down.

621
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,760
When? How?

622
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,520
It's not like
I wasn't gonna tell you.

623
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,320
He came into the ER,
he needed stitches.

624
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,400
Of course.

625
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,160
So I took the opportunity
to introduce myself.

626
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,120
He didn't make the connection
at first

627
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:05,200
because you hadn't told him my name.

628
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,640
It never came up.

629
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,360
Right.

630
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,200
What do you mean, "right"?

631
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,920
Did I enter at a bad time?

632
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,440
Glad you could make it, Dad.

633
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,080
I'm honored that you invited me.

634
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,560
When Mario was born,

635
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,400
I promised my wife that he
would never be part of our thing.

636
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,360
That we'd raise him to lead a good,
honest life.

637
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,360
And we did.

638
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,760
And he has.

639
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,720
He can't use the Falcone name

640
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,760
but he's brought true honor
to the family.

641
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,880
My wife is looking down on us now
and she's so proud and happy.

642
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,680
She would love you, Lee.

643
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,440
You're exactly the kind of woman
she would have wished for her son.

644
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,120
Thank you.

645
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,440
There's only one thing
that would have worried her.

646
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,920
Oh?

647
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,880
My wife would say
you're a little too beautiful.

648
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,240
All the great tragedies start
with a face like yours.

649
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,080
Makes men fall in love
when they shouldn't.

650
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:20,080
Makes them do crazy things.

651
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,320
Dad, really?

652
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,480
Are you referring to Jim Gordon?

653
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,680
I've spoken with him.

654
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,320
He's moved on.

655
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,360
I'm fine. He's fine.

656
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,640
We both have.

657
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,120
You've got nothing to worry about.

658
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,440
Here's to both of you,
a blessed union.

659
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,160
What the hell are you doing here?

660
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:18,160
I wanted to apologize for the way
I treated you last night.

661
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,840
I'm sorry.

662
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,800
I was insensitive and rude.

663
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,240
Does Alfred know you have his car?

664
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,160
No. Why tell him?

665
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,600
It's mine, not his.

666
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,760
Would you like to go for a ride?

667
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,880
Are you hungry?

668
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,560
What's with you?

669
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,160
You seem different.

670
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,000
Is that a bad thing?

671
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:51,600
I could eat.

672
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,360
Don't wait up, losers.
