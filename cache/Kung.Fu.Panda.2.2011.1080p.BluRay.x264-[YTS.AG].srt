15
00:01:13,096 --> 00:01:17,934

20
00:01:39,247 --> 00:01:42,083

00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,129
<i><font color="#80FFFF">and all of China would bow at his feet.</i></font>

22
00:02:17,577 --> 00:02:20,497
It's almost done, Lord Shen,
but we've run out of metal.

23
00:02:22,082 --> 00:02:26,586
Search the farthest villages!
Find more metal!

24
00:02:26,753 --> 00:02:28,630
China will be mine.

25
00:02:38,765 --> 00:02:41,976
And then the Dragon Warrior
joined the Furious Five!

26
00:02:42,143 --> 00:02:45,021
And they became the most
awesomest kung fu team ever!

27
00:02:45,188 --> 00:02:47,023
Enough talk. Let's fight!

28
00:02:48,274 --> 00:02:49,359
- Thirty-three...
- Listen, listen!

29
00:02:49,526 --> 00:02:51,861
You can hear the Dragon Warrior
training right now!

30
00:02:52,028 --> 00:02:53,446
Thirty-three. Stop him!

31
00:02:53,613 --> 00:02:54,864
- Thirty-four.
- It's too dangerous!

32
00:02:55,031 --> 00:02:57,367
- Thirty-five. Stay focused.
- Thirty-six!

33
00:02:57,534 --> 00:02:59,202
- Thirty-seven!
- Yeah!

34
00:02:59,369 --> 00:03:01,830
How is he doing that with his face?

35
00:03:05,542 --> 00:03:08,169
Thirty-eight bean buns!

36
00:03:08,336 --> 00:03:10,880
Yes! New record! You monster!

37
00:03:11,047 --> 00:03:13,341
- Keep going! Hit 40!
- He'll never hit 40.

38
00:03:13,508 --> 00:03:15,718
You guys wait and we'll go to 40.

39
00:03:15,885 --> 00:03:17,011
Do it.

40
00:03:17,178 --> 00:03:18,596
No problem!

41
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,351
Yeah!

42
00:03:24,477 --> 00:03:25,895
Give me a minute.

43
00:03:27,147 --> 00:03:28,565
Yeah!

44
00:03:29,566 --> 00:03:31,776
- He did it!
- Well done, Po!

45
00:03:33,361 --> 00:03:34,779
Your training has paid off.

46
00:03:36,072 --> 00:03:38,158
Master Shifu!
Gotta go. See you later!

47
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,244
You'll save those for me, right?

48
00:03:49,669 --> 00:03:51,087
Flippety-do.

49
00:04:01,723 --> 00:04:03,308
Inner peace.

50
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:08,813
Inner peace.

51
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:13,902
Inner peace.

52
00:04:14,068 --> 00:04:15,487
Master Shifu.

53
00:04:16,446 --> 00:04:18,364
Master Shifu, what do we got?

54
00:04:18,531 --> 00:04:21,451
Pirates? Vandals of Volcano Mountain?

55
00:04:21,618 --> 00:04:25,663
Whatever it is, I will take them down.
'Cause I am in a mood.

56
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:28,249
I need to get something done,
you know what I mean?

57
00:04:30,168 --> 00:04:31,419
What are you doing?

58
00:04:31,586 --> 00:04:35,006
One of Master Oogway's final teachings.

59
00:05:06,287 --> 00:05:07,288
Awesome!

60
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:10,375
How did you do that?

61
00:05:10,542 --> 00:05:14,546
- Inner peace.
- Inner piece. That's cool.

62
00:05:15,463 --> 00:05:19,425
- Inner piece of what?
- It is the next phase of your training.

63
00:05:19,592 --> 00:05:25,056
Every master must find his path
to inner peace.

64
00:05:25,223 --> 00:05:29,394
Some choose to meditate for 50 years
in a cave just like this...

65
00:05:31,437 --> 00:05:34,566
...without the slightest taste
of food or water.

66
00:05:36,317 --> 00:05:37,402
Or?

67
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:41,030
Some find it through
pain and suffering, as I did.

68
00:05:41,197 --> 00:05:44,576
Po, the day you were chosen
as Dragon Warrior

69
00:05:44,742 --> 00:05:46,578
was the worst day of my life.

70
00:05:47,453 --> 00:05:49,998
By far.
Nothing else came close.

71
00:05:50,164 --> 00:05:54,544
It was the worst, most painful,
mind-destroying, horrible moment...

72
00:05:54,711 --> 00:05:57,171
- OK.
- ...I have ever experienced.

73
00:06:01,175 --> 00:06:05,263
But once I realised the problem
was not you, but within me,

74
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:11,019
I found inner peace and was able
to harness the flow of the universe.

75
00:06:11,185 --> 00:06:13,730
So that's it? I just need inner peace?

76
00:06:13,896 --> 00:06:16,024
My innards are
already super, super peaceful,

77
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:19,611
so all I need to do
is just get this thing going.

78
00:06:19,777 --> 00:06:21,738
Inner peace, you're going down.

79
00:06:21,904 --> 00:06:23,698
Now show me what you were
doing there with your feet.

80
00:06:23,865 --> 00:06:24,949
I saw you do sort of a fancy foot...

81
00:06:25,116 --> 00:06:28,119
Po! Bandits!
Approaching the Musicians Village.

82
00:06:28,286 --> 00:06:29,370
Danger.

83
00:06:29,537 --> 00:06:33,458
Tell those musicians to start playing
some action music because it is on.

84
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,002
Don't worry, Shifu, I'll master
inner peace as soon as I get back.

85
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:37,795
No snack stops this time.

86
00:06:38,796 --> 00:06:40,673
Snack stops.

87
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,550
Wait, are you serious?

88
00:06:55,104 --> 00:06:57,190
Get all the metal you can find!

89
00:07:01,235 --> 00:07:02,528
Grab the metal!

90
00:07:08,117 --> 00:07:10,370
Help, help, help, help. Help!

91
00:07:13,581 --> 00:07:15,833
That's everything!
Let's get out of here.

92
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:18,127
Oh, no.

93
00:07:23,466 --> 00:07:25,468
Wings of Justice!

94
00:07:44,445 --> 00:07:45,655
The Dragon Warrior!

95
00:07:45,822 --> 00:07:48,116
A panda? That's impossible.

96
00:07:48,282 --> 00:07:50,201
My fist hungers for justice.

97
00:07:51,411 --> 00:07:53,079
That was my... fist.

98
00:07:53,246 --> 00:07:55,581
- Get 'em!
- Come on!

99
00:08:18,813 --> 00:08:20,148
Take that!

100
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:32,160
Po! Incoming!

101
00:08:32,326 --> 00:08:34,162
Thanks, Mantis!

102
00:08:52,597 --> 00:08:54,432
Tigress, Double Death Strike!

103
00:09:03,232 --> 00:09:04,275
Feet of Fury!

104
00:09:08,821 --> 00:09:11,115
Tigress! Monkey!

105
00:09:11,282 --> 00:09:13,242
Viper! Mantis!

106
00:09:13,409 --> 00:09:15,244
Bunny! What?

107
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,246
Oh, sorry.

108
00:09:23,336 --> 00:09:24,337
Help!

109
00:09:25,463 --> 00:09:27,423
- Crane, go!
- I'm on it!

110
00:09:46,567 --> 00:09:48,152
Is everyone OK?

111
00:09:48,694 --> 00:09:50,738
That was awesome!

112
00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:54,534
I got this.

113
00:10:05,837 --> 00:10:07,129
Po!

114
00:10:13,386 --> 00:10:14,929
Chew on that, tubby!

115
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,436
Help.

116
00:10:24,522 --> 00:10:26,858
- Sweetie, are you OK?
- What happened?

117
00:10:28,484 --> 00:10:30,194
I think I saw...

118
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:32,697
I think...

119
00:10:32,864 --> 00:10:34,282
I gotta go.

120
00:10:36,617 --> 00:10:41,873
Thank you. Thank you for coming
to Dragon Warrior Noodles and Tofu.

121
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:43,791
- More tea? Lemon sauce?
- No.

122
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:46,711
If you need anything, just ask.

123
00:10:47,628 --> 00:10:50,590
- Thank you.
- Feet of Fury!

124
00:10:50,756 --> 00:10:55,219
The Dragon Warrior's mop.
He mopped these very floors!

125
00:10:55,845 --> 00:10:58,723
No touching!
You'll get the mop dirty.

126
00:10:59,348 --> 00:11:01,225
- He once waited on me.
- Awesome!

127
00:11:01,392 --> 00:11:05,313
Yeah, I have the stain to prove it.
Hey, where is the Dragon Warrior?

128
00:11:05,479 --> 00:11:07,815
He doesn't work here any more.

129
00:11:07,982 --> 00:11:11,485
He's busy out there
protecting the Valley.

130
00:11:11,652 --> 00:11:13,154
- The Dragon Warrior!
- There he is.

131
00:11:13,321 --> 00:11:14,363
Po!

132
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:18,993
- Here. OK. Nice kid.
- The Dragon Warrior!

133
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,412
- You should've told me you were coming.
- Hi, Dad.

134
00:11:21,579 --> 00:11:23,831
I would have saved you some stinky tofu.

135
00:11:25,499 --> 00:11:28,502
- Dad, can I talk to you?
- Of course, son.

136
00:11:29,253 --> 00:11:34,842
In honour of my son,
free tofu dessert for everybody!

137
00:11:35,009 --> 00:11:36,886
With purchases.

138
00:11:37,053 --> 00:11:40,681
Oh, it's so good to see you, Po.

139
00:11:40,848 --> 00:11:44,477
Have you lost weight? I can
almost put my wings around you.

140
00:11:44,644 --> 00:11:46,312
Ah, well, maybe a little.

141
00:11:46,479 --> 00:11:50,316
Poor you, you must feel weak.
Let me get you some soup.

142
00:11:50,483 --> 00:11:52,068
No, that's OK, Dad.
I'm not hungry.

143
00:11:52,234 --> 00:11:54,904
Not hungry?
Po, are you all right?

144
00:11:55,071 --> 00:11:57,031
Yeah. No, I'm fine. I just...

145
00:11:57,198 --> 00:11:59,533
Earlier today,
I was fighting these bandits.

146
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,954
Nothing too dangerous.
I mean, they were just, you know...

147
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,082
- Yeah?
- And then the strangest thing happened.

148
00:12:06,248 --> 00:12:07,959
I had this crazy vision.

149
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:11,921
I think I saw my mom and me,
as a baby.

150
00:12:12,421 --> 00:12:14,715
Mom? A baby?

151
00:12:14,882 --> 00:12:19,220
- Dad?
- What...?

152
00:12:19,387 --> 00:12:21,430
How do I say this?

153
00:12:22,932 --> 00:12:24,934
Where did I come from?

154
00:12:28,813 --> 00:12:34,610
Well, you see, son,
baby geese come from a little egg.

155
00:12:34,986 --> 00:12:39,448
- Don't ask me where the egg comes from.
- Dad, that's not what I meant.

156
00:12:40,783 --> 00:12:42,827
I know it's not.

157
00:12:42,994 --> 00:12:48,290
I think it's time I told you something
I should have told you a long time ago.

158
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:50,251
OK.

159
00:12:50,418 --> 00:12:54,255
You might have been kind of a...

160
00:12:57,758 --> 00:12:59,427
...adopted.

161
00:12:59,593 --> 00:13:01,429
- I knew it.
- You knew?

162
00:13:01,595 --> 00:13:04,557
- Well, who told you?
- No one. I mean, come on, Dad.

163
00:13:04,724 --> 00:13:07,560
But if you knew,
why didn't you ever say anything?

164
00:13:07,727 --> 00:13:09,603
Why didn't you say anything?

165
00:13:11,939 --> 00:13:14,608
How did I get here, Dad?
Where did I come from?

166
00:13:16,318 --> 00:13:19,780
Actually... you came from this.

167
00:13:23,701 --> 00:13:26,537
It was just another day
at the restaurant.

168
00:13:26,704 --> 00:13:28,330
Time to make the noodles.

169
00:13:29,123 --> 00:13:33,627
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I went out to the back, where my
vegetables had just been delivered.</i></font>

170
00:13:33,794 --> 00:13:36,505
<i><font color="#80FFFF">There were cabbages, turnips, radishes.</i></font>

171
00:13:37,673 --> 00:13:40,301
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Only there were no radishes.</i></font>

172
00:13:40,468 --> 00:13:43,888
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Just a very hungry baby panda.</i></font>

173
00:13:46,724 --> 00:13:48,476
<i><font color="#80FFFF">There was no note.</i></font>

174
00:13:48,642 --> 00:13:50,686
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Of course, you could have eaten it.</i></font>

175
00:13:50,853 --> 00:13:55,858
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I waited for someone to come
looking for you, but no one did.</i></font>

176
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,842
<i><font color="#80FFFF">I brought you inside.</i></font>

177
00:14:24,095 --> 00:14:25,721
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Fed you.</i></font>

178
00:14:27,389 --> 00:14:28,891
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Gave you a bath.</i></font>

179
00:14:31,894 --> 00:14:33,896
<i><font color="#80FFFF">And fed you again.</i></font>

180
00:14:36,357 --> 00:14:37,983
<i><font color="#80FFFF">And again.</i></font>

181
00:14:40,194 --> 00:14:42,863
<i><font color="#80FFFF">And tried to put some pants on you.</i></font>

182
00:14:51,455 --> 00:14:55,417
<i><font color="#80FFFF">And then I made a decision
that would change my life forever.</i></font>

183
00:14:57,586 --> 00:15:00,714
<i><font color="#80FFFF">To make my soup without radishes.</i></font>

184
00:15:00,881 --> 00:15:05,136
<i><font color="#80FFFF">And to raise you as my own son.</i></font>

185
00:15:05,302 --> 00:15:09,515
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Xiao Po, my little panda.</i></font>

186
00:15:10,724 --> 00:15:15,062
<i><font color="#80FFFF">And from that moment on,
both my soup and my life</i></font>

187
00:15:15,229 --> 00:15:17,398
have been that much sweeter.

188
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,569
And, little Po,
that's the end of the story.

189
00:15:22,903 --> 00:15:25,906
Look at me. No, don't look at me.

190
00:15:26,073 --> 00:15:30,578
That's it? That can't be it.
There's gotta be more, Dad!

191
00:15:30,744 --> 00:15:34,957
Well, there was the time
you ate all my bamboo furniture.

192
00:15:35,124 --> 00:15:37,126
It was imported, too.

193
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:40,462
One dumpling, please,
Dragon Warrior size.

194
00:15:45,801 --> 00:15:49,680
Oh, Po, your story may not
have such a happy beginning,

195
00:15:49,972 --> 00:15:51,348
but look how it turned out.

196
00:15:51,515 --> 00:15:55,269
You got me, you got kung fu,
and you got noodles.

197
00:15:55,436 --> 00:15:58,105
I know. I just have so many questions.

198
00:15:58,272 --> 00:16:00,691
Like how did I ever fit
in this tiny basket?

199
00:16:00,858 --> 00:16:02,526
Why didn't I like pants?

200
00:16:04,862 --> 00:16:06,864
And who am I?

201
00:16:13,996 --> 00:16:15,956
Good. Watch your form.

202
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:20,127
Good.

203
00:16:21,712 --> 00:16:24,506
Better. Elbow.

204
00:16:24,673 --> 00:16:26,675
Straighten it out!

205
00:16:52,451 --> 00:16:54,662
Shen?

206
00:16:54,828 --> 00:16:57,790
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

207
00:16:57,957 --> 00:17:02,711
Now we've got the pleasantries
out of the way, please leave my house.

208
00:17:02,878 --> 00:17:05,005
- Your house?
- Yes.

209
00:17:05,172 --> 00:17:07,675
Didn't you see the peacock
on the front door?

210
00:17:09,635 --> 00:17:11,804
There you are, Soothsayer.

211
00:17:12,388 --> 00:17:17,142
It seems your fortune-telling skills
are not as good as you thought.

212
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:21,313
- We shall see, Shen.
- No, you shall see, old goat.

213
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,024
- Where were we?
- What do you want, Shen?

214
00:17:24,191 --> 00:17:28,696
What is rightfully mine. Gongmen City!

215
00:17:28,862 --> 00:17:31,532
Gongmen is under the stewardship
of the Masters' Council,

216
00:17:31,699 --> 00:17:35,536
and we will protect it. Even from you.

217
00:17:36,704 --> 00:17:39,957
I'm so glad you feel that way.

218
00:17:40,124 --> 00:17:42,960
Otherwise, I'd have dragged
that here for nothing.

219
00:17:43,127 --> 00:17:45,170
What's in the box, Shen?

220
00:17:45,337 --> 00:17:48,882
You want to see? It's a gift.

221
00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:52,845
It's your parting gift,
in that it will part you.

222
00:17:53,012 --> 00:17:54,555
Part of you here, part of you there

223
00:17:54,722 --> 00:17:58,684
and part of you way over there,
staining the wall!

224
00:17:58,851 --> 00:18:00,853
You insolent fool!

225
00:18:18,579 --> 00:18:21,373
- Show-off.
- That is a warning.

226
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,376
You are no match for our kung fu.

227
00:18:24,543 --> 00:18:26,503
I agree.

228
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,380
But this is.

229
00:18:42,353 --> 00:18:45,105
Are you familiar
with the master of Gongmen City?

230
00:18:45,272 --> 00:18:46,607
- Master Thundering Rhino?
- Yes.

231
00:18:46,774 --> 00:18:49,360
- Son of legendary Flying Rhino?
- Yes.

232
00:18:49,526 --> 00:18:52,488
And slayer of the Ten Thousand
Serpents in the Valley of Woe?

233
00:18:52,654 --> 00:18:54,698
- He's dead.
- Whoa.

234
00:18:54,865 --> 00:18:56,075
That's impossible.

235
00:18:56,241 --> 00:18:58,702
Rhino's Horn Defence
is impervious to any technique.

236
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:02,373
It was no technique.
Lord Shen has created a weapon,

237
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:04,958
one that breathes fire and spits metal.

238
00:19:05,584 --> 00:19:10,464
Unless he is stopped,
this could be the end of kung fu.

239
00:19:11,131 --> 00:19:15,010
- But I just got kung fu!
- And now you must save it.

240
00:19:15,177 --> 00:19:19,098
Go! Destroy this weapon
and bring Lord Shen to justice!

241
00:19:19,264 --> 00:19:21,100
OK, here we go! Here we go!

242
00:19:22,351 --> 00:19:24,978
Wait a second.
How can I do this?

243
00:19:25,145 --> 00:19:27,773
I mean, how can kung fu stop
something that stops kung fu?

244
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,858
Remember, Dragon Warrior,

245
00:19:30,025 --> 00:19:33,404
anything is possible
when you have inner peace.

246
00:19:39,118 --> 00:19:41,829
Inner peace. Inner peace. Inner peace.

247
00:19:42,663 --> 00:19:43,747
Peace on.

248
00:19:43,914 --> 00:19:45,958
- Oh, Po?
- Peace!

249
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,252
Oh, Po, I got you a travel pack.

250
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:51,505
I packed you food for weeks.
Cookies, buns, vegetables.

251
00:19:51,672 --> 00:19:54,925
And I even packed
all your action figures. See?

252
00:19:58,011 --> 00:20:01,306
I don't know what those are.
Never seen them before in my life.

253
00:20:01,473 --> 00:20:03,350
Dad, you got scratches on my Tigress.

254
00:20:03,517 --> 00:20:06,395
I also packed your paintings
of our best time together,

255
00:20:06,562 --> 00:20:09,106
just in case you get lonely.

256
00:20:09,273 --> 00:20:13,110
That's me and you making noodles.
And that's me and you eating noodles.

257
00:20:13,277 --> 00:20:15,696
And that's me giving you
a piggyback ride.

258
00:20:17,156 --> 00:20:20,117
That cute? On second thought,
I'll hang on to this one.

259
00:20:20,284 --> 00:20:24,163
- Hey, they're waiting for me.
- Of course, of course.

260
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:27,499
You have a job to do... far from home,

261
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:31,378
in a strange city, filled with
strange people, and strange noodles,

262
00:20:31,545 --> 00:20:35,299
facing horrible danger
from which you might never return!

263
00:20:35,466 --> 00:20:38,051
- Don't go, Po!
- I gotta go.

264
00:20:38,218 --> 00:20:41,513
I'm the Dragon Warrior.
It's kind of my job to save kung fu.

265
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,641
And if I don't... what am I?

266
00:20:44,808 --> 00:20:47,269
You're my son.

267
00:20:49,938 --> 00:20:51,064
Right?

268
00:20:52,399 --> 00:20:55,486
- Po, it's time.
- Goodbye.

269
00:20:57,571 --> 00:20:58,989
Don't worry, Mr. Ping.

270
00:20:59,156 --> 00:21:01,533
He'll be back before
you can say "noodles".

271
00:21:07,247 --> 00:21:09,249
Noodles.

272
00:21:15,672 --> 00:21:17,508
Come on, guys, let's go!

273
00:21:17,674 --> 00:21:18,884
Yeah!

274
00:21:21,678 --> 00:21:23,263
Yeah...

275
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:26,183
Yeah, yeah. Yeah...

276
00:22:45,762 --> 00:22:47,264
Mama?

277
00:22:52,477 --> 00:22:55,314
Mom? Dad? Is that you?

278
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,816
Mom! Dad!

279
00:22:59,693 --> 00:23:02,154
Oh, hi. Hey, son. You're back.

280
00:23:03,697 --> 00:23:05,532
Honey, what are you doing here?

281
00:23:05,699 --> 00:23:06,700
But I thought...

282
00:23:06,867 --> 00:23:09,828
We replaced you, dear,
with this lovely radish.

283
00:23:10,912 --> 00:23:14,041
- Radish?
- It's quiet, polite, and, frankly,

284
00:23:14,207 --> 00:23:16,585
does better kung fu.

285
00:23:16,752 --> 00:23:18,462
No. No, no, no.

286
00:23:22,549 --> 00:23:23,550
Wait!

287
00:23:29,765 --> 00:23:30,807
No.

288
00:23:39,358 --> 00:23:42,027
Radish, radish, radish, radish.

289
00:23:50,577 --> 00:23:52,412
Inner pea...

290
00:23:55,207 --> 00:23:56,291
Pea...

291
00:23:58,752 --> 00:24:00,337
Inner peace.

292
00:24:16,687 --> 00:24:21,525
Inner peace! Inner peace! Inner peace!
Inner peace! Inner peace...!

293
00:24:27,447 --> 00:24:29,449
I'm... training.

294
00:24:29,616 --> 00:24:31,910
The mast is not a worthy opponent.

295
00:24:35,622 --> 00:24:37,958
- I am ready.
- OK.

296
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:40,127
So serious.

297
00:24:47,843 --> 00:24:49,928
I think I prefer the mast.

298
00:24:50,095 --> 00:24:54,808
Apologies. I used to punch the
ironwood trees by the palace to train.

299
00:24:54,975 --> 00:24:56,309
Now I feel nothing.

300
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,354
That's severely cool.

301
00:25:02,315 --> 00:25:03,316
Again!

302
00:25:05,819 --> 00:25:10,240
So, this punching ironwood trees,
how long did you have to do that?

303
00:25:10,407 --> 00:25:13,160
- Twenty years.
- Oh, 20, 20 years.

304
00:25:14,077 --> 00:25:16,329
Is there any, you know, faster way?

305
00:25:16,496 --> 00:25:19,207
You know, until you, you know,
don't feel anything?

306
00:25:19,374 --> 00:25:21,334
No. Besides...

307
00:25:25,338 --> 00:25:28,341
...I don't think
hard style is your thing.

308
00:25:32,846 --> 00:25:35,474
Po, why are you really out here?

309
00:25:36,808 --> 00:25:40,187
I just found out that my dad
isn't really my dad.

310
00:25:42,272 --> 00:25:44,065
Your dad? The goose.

311
00:25:46,693 --> 00:25:48,945
That must have been quite a shock.

312
00:25:49,112 --> 00:25:51,031
Yeah.

313
00:25:51,198 --> 00:25:54,034
- And this bothers you?
- Are you kidding me?

314
00:25:54,201 --> 00:25:57,204
We're warriors, right?
Nerves of steel.

315
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,331
Souls of platinum.

316
00:25:59,498 --> 00:26:00,707
Like you.

317
00:26:00,874 --> 00:26:02,834
So hard-core, you don't feel anything.

318
00:26:07,339 --> 00:26:09,382
- I was...
- So, what are you guys talking about?

319
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,052
Nothing. Nothing.

320
00:26:12,219 --> 00:26:14,387
Po's having daddy issues.

321
00:26:14,554 --> 00:26:17,641
I'm so lucky.
I don't have any problems with my dad.

322
00:26:17,808 --> 00:26:20,185
Maybe it's because Mom
ate his head before I was born.

323
00:26:20,352 --> 00:26:23,188
- I don't know.
- Mantis, this isn't about you.

324
00:26:23,355 --> 00:26:25,398
Po is the one freaking out.

325
00:26:25,565 --> 00:26:27,734
- I'm not freaking out.
- Po.

326
00:26:27,901 --> 00:26:30,111
- I'm freaking in.
- Po!

327
00:26:30,278 --> 00:26:32,948
- What?
- We're here.

328
00:26:33,114 --> 00:26:35,075
Gongmen City.

329
00:26:51,424 --> 00:26:53,969
My father's throne.

330
00:26:54,135 --> 00:26:57,180
He used to let me play here beside him,

331
00:26:57,347 --> 00:27:01,852
promising someday,
this throne would be mine.

332
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:07,983
A little to the left.

333
00:27:08,149 --> 00:27:10,277
Oh, but it's so heavy, Master!

334
00:27:10,443 --> 00:27:13,738
Thirty years I've waited
for this moment.

335
00:27:13,905 --> 00:27:17,409
Everything must be exactly
how I envisioned it.

336
00:27:17,576 --> 00:27:21,288
And I envisioned it
a little to the left.

337
00:27:22,205 --> 00:27:23,498
Perfect!

338
00:27:23,665 --> 00:27:26,877
With the weapon by my si...
A little bit more.

339
00:27:29,045 --> 00:27:34,801
With the weapon by my side,
all of China will bow before me.

340
00:27:34,968 --> 00:27:36,636
We move out in three days,

341
00:27:36,803 --> 00:27:40,640
when the moon is full
and the tide is high.

342
00:27:42,309 --> 00:27:45,437
Now, you old goat,
why don't you tell me my...

343
00:27:45,604 --> 00:27:46,646
Fortune?

344
00:27:47,522 --> 00:27:50,525
Future. I was going to say future.

345
00:27:51,484 --> 00:27:55,071
Look into your bowl
and tell me what glory awaits.

346
00:27:56,781 --> 00:28:00,327
If you continue on your current path...

347
00:28:02,662 --> 00:28:06,666
...you will find yourself
at the bottom of the stairs.

348
00:28:09,294 --> 00:28:11,171
I see...

349
00:28:11,963 --> 00:28:13,965
I see...

350
00:28:14,716 --> 00:28:18,178
I see pain... and anger.

351
00:28:18,345 --> 00:28:21,348
How dare you!
That is the finest silk in the province!

352
00:28:21,514 --> 00:28:22,641
Followed by denial.

353
00:28:22,807 --> 00:28:25,352
This is not fortune-telling.
You're just saying

354
00:28:25,518 --> 00:28:27,520
- what's happening right...
- Now?

355
00:28:29,189 --> 00:28:31,858
The most important time is now.

356
00:28:33,109 --> 00:28:35,528
But if you really want
to see the future...

357
00:28:38,406 --> 00:28:40,075
Oh, what do you see?

358
00:28:45,997 --> 00:28:47,832
A peacock...

359
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:53,213
...is defeated by a warrior
of black and white.

360
00:28:54,422 --> 00:28:56,424
Nothing has changed.

361
00:29:02,973 --> 00:29:05,517
That's impossible, and you know it.

362
00:29:05,684 --> 00:29:08,895
It is not impossible, and he knows it.

363
00:29:09,062 --> 00:29:10,355
Who?

364
00:29:10,522 --> 00:29:13,525
- Lord Shen! I saw a panda!
- A panda?

365
00:29:15,777 --> 00:29:18,071
A kung fu warrior.
It fought like a demon!

366
00:29:18,238 --> 00:29:19,864
Big and furry.

367
00:29:20,031 --> 00:29:23,201
Soft and squishy.
Kind of plush and cuddly.

368
00:29:23,785 --> 00:29:26,997
There are no more pandas.

369
00:29:27,163 --> 00:29:30,500
Even with his poor eyesight,
he can see the truth.

370
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:33,545
Why is it that you cannot?

371
00:29:34,462 --> 00:29:37,590
Find this panda and bring him to me!

372
00:29:37,757 --> 00:29:39,509
Yes, sir!

373
00:29:39,676 --> 00:29:43,513
One panda lives.
That does not make you right.

374
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:47,517
You're right.
Being right makes me right.

375
00:29:48,101 --> 00:29:52,063
Then I will kill him and make you wrong.

376
00:29:54,065 --> 00:29:56,192
Will you stop that!

377
00:30:08,246 --> 00:30:11,332
That must be Shen's palace
on the other side of the city.

378
00:30:11,499 --> 00:30:14,044
Great. We'll march into the tower
and proclaim,

379
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:16,254
"We are the Dragon Warrior
and the Furious Five,

380
00:30:16,421 --> 00:30:18,423
and we are here
to bring you to justice!"

381
00:30:21,676 --> 00:30:24,512
What are you doing?
This place is crawling with wolves.

382
00:30:30,101 --> 00:30:32,604
Hey, isn't that the guy
who hammered you in the face?

383
00:30:36,066 --> 00:30:37,650
I do not like that guy.

384
00:30:37,817 --> 00:30:41,446
We need to get to that tower
without being spotted by those wolves.

385
00:30:41,613 --> 00:30:44,115
Got it. Stealth mode.

386
00:31:07,555 --> 00:31:09,766
- Get out of the way!
- Foiled again.

387
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:13,603
Now, where'd those noodles go?

388
00:31:19,859 --> 00:31:21,945
Hello. I couldn't help but...

389
00:31:22,737 --> 00:31:25,031
Yeah, OK. Anyway, where was I?

390
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:28,201
- Where's Po?
- How can we lose a guy that big?

391
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,123
OK.

392
00:31:39,921 --> 00:31:41,631
Guys! Guys?

393
00:31:41,798 --> 00:31:43,508
- Hey, Po.
- What? Sorry.

394
00:31:43,675 --> 00:31:45,176
So that was stealth mode, huh?

395
00:31:45,343 --> 00:31:47,804
To be honest,
not one of my stronger modes.

396
00:31:47,971 --> 00:31:50,390
...gold in there, come on!

397
00:31:51,724 --> 00:31:53,017
This rice is raw!

398
00:31:53,184 --> 00:31:55,728
You stole all my metal pots
for Lord Shen!

399
00:31:55,895 --> 00:31:59,065
Either you cook my rice, or I cook you!

400
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:01,985
- My apologies, but...
- Po, do something.

401
00:32:02,152 --> 00:32:04,654
How am I supposed to help her cook rice
without getting caught?

402
00:32:04,821 --> 00:32:06,865
- Wait, I have a better idea.
- ...two...

403
00:32:07,031 --> 00:32:08,241
...one.

404
00:32:08,408 --> 00:32:10,034
- Hey.
- Hey.

405
00:32:21,337 --> 00:32:23,756
We're here to liberate the city
and bring Shen to justice.

406
00:32:23,923 --> 00:32:25,633
- You will need help.
- Thank you, brave sheep,

407
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,260
but it's too dangerous. I can't let you.

408
00:32:27,427 --> 00:32:30,597
Oh, no, not me.
It's not safe to speak here.

409
00:32:30,763 --> 00:32:32,223
Right.

410
00:32:34,601 --> 00:32:37,103
I'm talking about Masters Ox and Croc.

411
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:40,648
They're in Gongmen Jail
on Black Dragon Alley.

412
00:32:40,815 --> 00:32:42,442
What? They're still alive?

413
00:32:42,609 --> 00:32:44,611
They must be in that jail
gathering intelligence,

414
00:32:44,777 --> 00:32:47,488
hatching a plot to use their
awesomeness to defeat the weapon!

415
00:32:47,655 --> 00:32:49,324
OK, let's go!

416
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:52,577
- Thanks, sheep.
- Hey! Stop that costume!

417
00:32:52,744 --> 00:32:54,037
- Hold it right there!
- Get them!

418
00:32:54,704 --> 00:32:56,456
- Get them!
- Sorry!

419
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:58,791
Take that!

420
00:32:58,958 --> 00:33:00,543
- Keep going!
- Faster!

421
00:33:01,628 --> 00:33:02,629
Hey, stop!

422
00:33:22,815 --> 00:33:24,817
- Look out! Watch it!
- Sorry!

423
00:33:24,984 --> 00:33:26,069
Surround him.

424
00:33:28,488 --> 00:33:29,989
Now!

425
00:33:30,156 --> 00:33:31,908
Gotcha!

426
00:33:32,951 --> 00:33:34,202
What? Where'd he go?

427
00:33:34,369 --> 00:33:37,163
- Spread out! Search everywhere!
- What about over there?

428
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:41,292
- Is "there" a part of "everywhere"?
- I... I guess.

429
00:33:41,459 --> 00:33:42,919
Then search there!

430
00:33:47,924 --> 00:33:51,344
They must be close. I can feel
a kung fu chill riding up my spine.

431
00:33:51,511 --> 00:33:53,513
Sorry, Po. It's just me.

432
00:33:54,681 --> 00:33:56,683
Look. Gongmen Jail.

433
00:34:00,311 --> 00:34:02,105
Aw, it's cute.

434
00:34:03,189 --> 00:34:04,565
Cute, huh?

435
00:34:13,825 --> 00:34:15,410
Nice work, Po.

436
00:34:16,869 --> 00:34:19,497
At the first sign of trouble,
I'll give you a signal.

437
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,834
- You mean like Crane does?
- Yeah.

438
00:34:23,001 --> 00:34:25,378
Excuse me,
when have I ever made that noise?

439
00:34:26,212 --> 00:34:28,506
Master Ox! Master!

440
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,218
The ferocious Master Croc!

441
00:34:34,178 --> 00:34:36,556
And Master Storming Ox.

442
00:34:37,598 --> 00:34:40,393
I can't believe we're rescuing
actual legends of kung fu.

443
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,562
We're gonna free you from those
bonds of injustice. No problem.

444
00:34:42,729 --> 00:34:45,356
Gotta be a key around here. No,
they wouldn't leave a key around here.

445
00:34:46,774 --> 00:34:49,610
Oh, good! You found it.
Come on, you guys! Yeah!

446
00:34:49,777 --> 00:34:51,779
We're coming for you, Shen!

447
00:34:57,368 --> 00:35:00,496
Guys, are we going or not?
Do you want to meet us there later?

448
00:35:00,663 --> 00:35:02,415
I mean, you do want to
take back your city, right?

449
00:35:02,582 --> 00:35:04,292
Of course we do.

450
00:35:04,459 --> 00:35:08,296
But if we stand up to Shen,
he will turn the weapon on the city.

451
00:35:08,463 --> 00:35:10,256
Listen to yourself.
You're protecting Gongmen City

452
00:35:10,423 --> 00:35:12,216
by not protecting Gongmen City?

453
00:35:12,383 --> 00:35:17,013
- If we all fight together...
- Then the weapon would kill everyone.

454
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:20,933
Oh, would it?
Then we use... a sneak attack!

455
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:23,686
- We get inside and then...
- And then you will be stopped...

456
00:35:26,773 --> 00:35:28,441
...by the unstoppable weapon.

457
00:35:28,608 --> 00:35:30,943
Nothing's unstoppable except for me
when I'm stopping you

458
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:33,613
from telling me something's unstoppable!

459
00:35:44,082 --> 00:35:47,168
Master Ox,
I'm not letting you stay in this cell.

460
00:35:47,335 --> 00:35:48,878
I'd like to see you get me out!

461
00:35:54,467 --> 00:35:56,844
You guys see that?
It's called being awesome.

462
00:35:57,011 --> 00:35:58,888
Come on! Whatever
happened to being heroes?

463
00:35:59,055 --> 00:36:01,808
The only hero in this town
is a dead one!

464
00:36:06,396 --> 00:36:10,108
Like I said, you are not
getting me out of this cell!

465
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:14,695
Yes!

466
00:36:15,071 --> 00:36:16,739
All right, let's go!

467
00:36:17,573 --> 00:36:18,825
I get the top bunk.

468
00:36:20,993 --> 00:36:25,164
It's time to surrender, panda.
Kung fu is dead.

469
00:36:25,331 --> 00:36:26,833
I...

470
00:36:29,961 --> 00:36:31,045
You...

471
00:36:31,212 --> 00:36:34,382
Kung fu is dead? Fine!

472
00:36:34,549 --> 00:36:38,010
You stay in your prison of fear
with bars made of hopelessness.

473
00:36:38,177 --> 00:36:41,389
And all you get are three
square meals a day of shame!

474
00:36:41,556 --> 00:36:43,182
With despair for dessert.

475
00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:46,519
We'll take on Shen and prove
to all those who are hungry

476
00:36:46,686 --> 00:36:50,606
for justice and honour
that kung fu still lives!

477
00:36:50,773 --> 00:36:52,150
Yeah!

478
00:36:55,278 --> 00:36:56,404
Monkey?!

479
00:36:57,947 --> 00:36:59,282
You! You're mine!

480
00:36:59,449 --> 00:37:01,409
I'll tell you what's gonna be yours!

481
00:37:01,576 --> 00:37:04,495
My fist in your plush, cuddly,
super-soft face!

482
00:37:07,123 --> 00:37:08,541
Get him!

483
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:10,793
- Get me out of here!
- Yes, sir!

484
00:37:11,627 --> 00:37:13,004
Stop him!

485
00:37:16,007 --> 00:37:17,300
Faster!

486
00:37:20,386 --> 00:37:22,889
Yeah! Go, go!

487
00:37:23,514 --> 00:37:25,558
- Lose him!
- Yes, sir!

488
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,562
- Viper!
- Hang on!

489
00:37:38,988 --> 00:37:41,741
- What?
- Watch out!

490
00:37:44,327 --> 00:37:46,412
Uncool! Very uncool!

491
00:37:46,787 --> 00:37:49,582
Try this!

492
00:37:49,749 --> 00:37:50,917
Guys, guys, guys!

493
00:37:56,172 --> 00:37:57,757
Maybe something smaller!

494
00:37:58,299 --> 00:38:00,426
No, no! Oh, no, no.

495
00:38:04,972 --> 00:38:07,725
Cute bunnies, off the face.
Excuse me! OK, pardon me!

496
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,070
Fire!

497
00:38:19,737 --> 00:38:21,280
We've lost them.

498
00:38:30,289 --> 00:38:32,250
Again! Again!

499
00:38:33,376 --> 00:38:34,627
Crane, catch!

500
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:39,131
Gotcha!

501
00:38:48,432 --> 00:38:50,434
Guys, guys, guys, guys,
give me a shove!

502
00:38:51,185 --> 00:38:53,145
Mantis, now!

503
00:39:06,576 --> 00:39:10,413
Is that all you got? It feels like
I'm fighting a big old fluffy cloud!

504
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:12,832
Well, this cloud is about
to bring the thunder!

505
00:39:16,043 --> 00:39:17,169
Your turn!

506
00:39:19,297 --> 00:39:22,842
Why... are... there...
so... many... signs?!

507
00:39:38,649 --> 00:39:40,985
Come here! Alaka-squasho!

508
00:39:42,278 --> 00:39:45,656
Yes! Taste the defeat!

509
00:39:45,823 --> 00:39:47,199
Let me tell you something.

510
00:39:47,366 --> 00:39:50,369
Next time you mess with a panda,
you better bring a whole a...

511
00:40:00,421 --> 00:40:01,964
Guess nobody told you,

512
00:40:02,131 --> 00:40:05,051
if you mess with the wolf,
you get the fangs.

513
00:40:05,551 --> 00:40:09,430
I've hit you twice.
What are you going to do now?

514
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:14,268
We surrender!

515
00:40:17,813 --> 00:40:22,026
You can chain my body, but you will
never chain my... warrior spirit.

516
00:40:22,193 --> 00:40:24,695
- Hey, don't forget the little guy.
- Did you just call...?

517
00:40:24,862 --> 00:40:28,032
- Po, what are you doing?
- Trust me. I got a pl...

518
00:40:29,575 --> 00:40:32,578
No way. Eight-point acupressure cuffs?

519
00:40:32,745 --> 00:40:35,998
Just like the ones that held Tai Lung.
The more you move, the tighter they get.

520
00:40:36,749 --> 00:40:38,918
These are the best cuffs!

521
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:44,090
Greetings, panda. At last we meet!

522
00:40:45,466 --> 00:40:47,301
No, no, no...

523
00:40:50,596 --> 00:40:54,600
We meet at last! Yes, that's it.

524
00:40:54,767 --> 00:40:57,269
Greetings, panda. We meet at...

525
00:40:58,771 --> 00:41:02,525
- You are afraid for a reason.
- I am not afraid.

526
00:41:02,692 --> 00:41:05,444
He is coming to me in chains.

527
00:41:05,611 --> 00:41:08,114
- If anyone should be afraid, it's...
- You.

528
00:41:11,367 --> 00:41:13,744
Don't even think about it.

529
00:41:26,966 --> 00:41:29,719
I hope this turns out better than
your plan to cook rice in your stomach

530
00:41:29,885 --> 00:41:32,221
by eating it raw
and then drinking boiling water.

531
00:41:32,388 --> 00:41:34,473
This plan's nothing like that plan.

532
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,767
- How?
- 'Cause this one's going to work.

533
00:41:49,321 --> 00:41:51,323
Keep moving.

534
00:41:56,996 --> 00:41:59,582
Ah, my old enemy...

535
00:42:04,086 --> 00:42:06,172
...stairs.

536
00:42:34,492 --> 00:42:37,703
Thanks for carrying me
those last few flights. OK.

537
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:40,289
I threw up a little bit
on the third floor.

538
00:42:40,456 --> 00:42:41,874
Someone might want to clean that up.

539
00:42:42,041 --> 00:42:44,710
Is there some sort of evil janitor
or something?

540
00:42:44,877 --> 00:42:46,462
Greetings, panda.

541
00:42:46,629 --> 00:42:48,964
- We meet at...
- Hey, how you doing?

542
00:42:50,674 --> 00:42:52,092
Hey.

543
00:42:52,259 --> 00:42:55,262
You've grown up bigger than I thought.

544
00:42:55,429 --> 00:42:58,140
Hey... enough with the poking around.

545
00:42:58,307 --> 00:43:01,060
Strong. Healthy.

546
00:43:01,227 --> 00:43:03,896
Look, I don't know who you are,
but please stand aside, sir.

547
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:06,524
- That's a lady.
- Oh! Sorry.

548
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:09,401
The beard threw me.
It's kind of misleading.

549
00:43:09,568 --> 00:43:12,655
- False advertising.
- Enough of this nonsense!

550
00:43:12,822 --> 00:43:14,490
Bring the prisoners to me.

551
00:43:14,657 --> 00:43:16,283
Sorry, ma'am. Get ready, guys.

552
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:18,994
Keep your eyes peeled for the...
weapon!

553
00:43:23,415 --> 00:43:24,625
Sparrow kick!

554
00:43:26,669 --> 00:43:29,839
We did it! I just kung fu-ed it!
Did you guys see that? I was all like...

555
00:43:39,014 --> 00:43:42,268
Do you actually believe this is
the warrior destined to defeat me?

556
00:43:42,434 --> 00:43:45,604
I do not. I know he is.

557
00:43:46,897 --> 00:43:50,359
Oh, look at him.
A lifetime to plot his revenge

558
00:43:50,526 --> 00:43:54,029
- and he comes to me on his knees.
- What? A lifetime?

559
00:43:54,196 --> 00:43:55,447
I did not have a lifetime.

560
00:43:55,614 --> 00:43:57,575
We only heard about Master Rhino
a few days ago,

561
00:43:57,741 --> 00:44:02,454
- and we came to avenge him!
- You've come to avenge nothing else?

562
00:44:02,621 --> 00:44:05,124
Well, yeah.
All the pots and pans that you stole.

563
00:44:05,291 --> 00:44:07,710
- I'm gonna want those back.
- Nothing else?

564
00:44:07,877 --> 00:44:10,462
You probably did some other evil stuff
along the way. I don't know.

565
00:44:10,629 --> 00:44:12,798
- What else did you do?
- You don't know?

566
00:44:12,965 --> 00:44:15,175
Know what? What's so funny?

567
00:44:15,342 --> 00:44:18,470
The very thing
that you clearly do not know!

568
00:44:18,637 --> 00:44:22,558
OK, enough of these riddles!
Would you guys spill the beans?

569
00:44:22,725 --> 00:44:26,061
First, we come in and the weapon
is tiny. Surprise, it's big.

570
00:44:26,228 --> 00:44:29,231
And then the lady over here,
I think it's a guy, 'cause he's got...

571
00:44:30,566 --> 00:44:33,110
The only reason you are still alive

572
00:44:33,277 --> 00:44:38,073
is that I find your stupidity
mildly amusing.

573
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:41,577
Well, thank you. But I find your
evilness extremely annoying.

574
00:44:41,744 --> 00:44:43,621
Who do you think you are, panda?

575
00:44:43,787 --> 00:44:46,498
Who do you think I am, peacock?

576
00:44:55,090 --> 00:44:57,259
Why are we laughing?

577
00:44:58,302 --> 00:44:59,470
Take aim.

578
00:45:11,148 --> 00:45:12,566
Fire.

579
00:45:16,695 --> 00:45:19,448
Well, light the... thing!

580
00:45:19,615 --> 00:45:21,200
I did!

581
00:45:25,955 --> 00:45:27,831
Fear the bug!

582
00:45:36,882 --> 00:45:38,342
Get the weapon!

583
00:45:40,344 --> 00:45:42,221
Tigress!

584
00:46:15,045 --> 00:46:16,505
You... You were there.

585
00:46:16,672 --> 00:46:19,591
Yes. Yes, I was.

586
00:46:27,558 --> 00:46:30,602
- You just let Shen get away!
- At least we destroyed the weapon.

587
00:46:35,232 --> 00:46:36,650
Fire!

588
00:46:39,611 --> 00:46:41,447
Oh. No, he's got way more.

589
00:46:47,786 --> 00:46:49,163
- My wing!
- Help, Po!

590
00:46:49,329 --> 00:46:50,748
Coming!

591
00:46:51,623 --> 00:46:54,043
- Watch out!
- Po!

592
00:46:57,337 --> 00:47:00,215
- Help me up!
- No. Get him down.

593
00:47:00,382 --> 00:47:01,925
Use the ropes.

594
00:47:10,809 --> 00:47:12,895
Run, run, little panda!

595
00:47:24,156 --> 00:47:27,242
- Po, come on. We need you to focus!
- I got it, I got it!

596
00:47:27,409 --> 00:47:29,036
Bring it down!

597
00:47:32,498 --> 00:47:34,792
- We're trapped!
- This way!

598
00:47:39,171 --> 00:47:40,672
Goodbye!

599
00:47:43,717 --> 00:47:45,052
Fire!

600
00:47:46,512 --> 00:47:47,930
Get back!

601
00:47:55,979 --> 00:47:57,981
The only way out is up.

602
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:00,109
What?

603
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,997
Follow me! Come on!

604
00:48:14,164 --> 00:48:15,499
Where are they going?

605
00:48:15,666 --> 00:48:18,502
- To the top!
- Come on! Keep going!

606
00:48:25,759 --> 00:48:27,302
Here we go!

607
00:48:45,988 --> 00:48:49,324
- You idiot!
- My nose!

608
00:48:49,491 --> 00:48:53,912
Call in the wolves! All of them!
I want them ready to move!

609
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,708
The Year of the Peacock begins now!

610
00:48:57,875 --> 00:49:00,752
Right now?
'Cause it's the middle of the year,

611
00:49:00,919 --> 00:49:03,589
so you'd only get like
a half of the Year of the Peacock.

612
00:49:05,382 --> 00:49:08,510
And this is the Year, of course,
of the Peacock.

613
00:49:08,677 --> 00:49:10,679
Happy New Year, sir.

614
00:49:14,516 --> 00:49:18,770
Get the wolves ready.
We're loading the ships now.

615
00:49:18,937 --> 00:49:20,022
Now!

616
00:49:20,189 --> 00:49:22,107
Now, now, now, now, now!

617
00:49:22,274 --> 00:49:25,068
Move! Move, move, move, move!

618
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:43,086
This way.

619
00:49:47,466 --> 00:49:49,301
Let's go.

620
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,976
Oh, you! What did you do?
It's chaos up there.

621
00:49:58,143 --> 00:49:59,811
What happened to stopping Shen?

622
00:50:01,271 --> 00:50:02,898
Yeah.

623
00:50:04,316 --> 00:50:06,485
Guys, come on.
Give me a little credit.

624
00:50:06,652 --> 00:50:08,779
I meant for him to get away.

625
00:50:08,946 --> 00:50:11,907
'Cause... it was a trick. It was a plot.

626
00:50:12,074 --> 00:50:16,995
I was thinking...
I'll figure out his plot more.

627
00:50:17,663 --> 00:50:19,665
That makes no sense.

628
00:50:19,831 --> 00:50:21,500
What do you mean? Sure it does.

629
00:50:21,667 --> 00:50:25,003
Po, the truth.
You had Shen. What happened?

630
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:27,214
What are you talking about?
I don't know what you're talking about.

631
00:50:27,381 --> 00:50:29,925
I... Yeah...
OK, he caught me off guard.

632
00:50:30,634 --> 00:50:31,885
The truth.

633
00:50:35,264 --> 00:50:39,017
Fine. They will keep you
far from danger.

634
00:50:39,184 --> 00:50:41,728
- Real far.
- What?

635
00:50:41,895 --> 00:50:44,022
You're staying here.

636
00:50:44,523 --> 00:50:46,942
Wait! I have to go ba...

637
00:50:52,322 --> 00:50:54,157
You're staying here!

638
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:56,868
I'm going. And you can't stop me.

639
00:51:00,163 --> 00:51:02,416
OK. I wasn't ready that time.

640
00:51:02,582 --> 00:51:04,293
Guys? Don't.

641
00:51:04,459 --> 00:51:05,544
Ready.

642
00:51:06,169 --> 00:51:07,212
Look!

643
00:51:19,766 --> 00:51:21,143
Stay down.

644
00:51:22,769 --> 00:51:25,856
- I have to get to him.
- Then tell me why!

645
00:51:28,233 --> 00:51:30,569
He was there! OK?

646
00:51:30,736 --> 00:51:33,947
The peacock was there
the last time I saw my parents.

647
00:51:34,114 --> 00:51:37,743
He knows what happened.
Where I came from.

648
00:51:37,909 --> 00:51:40,370
Who I am.

649
00:51:44,041 --> 00:51:46,043
Look, I'm going.

650
00:51:46,668 --> 00:51:49,087
I have to know.

651
00:51:49,254 --> 00:51:51,298
The hard core can't understand.

652
00:51:51,465 --> 00:51:53,175
Tigress, no!

653
00:51:57,346 --> 00:51:59,348
The hard core do understand.

654
00:52:01,058 --> 00:52:03,685
But I can't watch my friend be killed.

655
00:52:05,103 --> 00:52:09,191
- We're going.
- Maybe you can't watch me be killed?

656
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:12,277
- Stop being a wimp.
- And she's back.

657
00:52:13,945 --> 00:52:16,114
- No.
- Don't worry, kid.

658
00:52:16,281 --> 00:52:18,075
You're better off here.

659
00:52:27,626 --> 00:52:32,130
You were wrong, Soothsayer.
We sail to victory tonight.

660
00:52:32,964 --> 00:52:35,300
Your magic panda is clearly a fool.

661
00:52:35,467 --> 00:52:38,428
Are you certain it is the panda
who is a fool?

662
00:52:38,595 --> 00:52:40,972
You just destroyed
your ancestral home, Shen.

663
00:52:41,139 --> 00:52:46,478
A trivial sacrifice...
when all of China is my reward.

664
00:52:46,645 --> 00:52:49,106
Then will you finally be satisfied?

665
00:52:49,272 --> 00:52:53,485
Will the subjugation of the whole world
finally make you feel better?

666
00:52:54,027 --> 00:52:58,031
It's a start. I might also convert
the basement into a dungeon.

667
00:53:00,951 --> 00:53:03,662
The cup you choose to fill
has no bottom.

668
00:53:03,829 --> 00:53:06,832
It is time to stop this madness.

669
00:53:07,874 --> 00:53:09,793
Why on earth would I do that?

670
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,170
So your parents can rest in peace.

671
00:53:13,004 --> 00:53:15,966
My parents hated me.

672
00:53:17,175 --> 00:53:20,053
Do you understand?

673
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:25,600
They wronged me...
and I will make it right.

674
00:53:25,767 --> 00:53:27,060
They loved you.

675
00:53:27,227 --> 00:53:31,982
They loved you so much that
having to send you away killed them.

676
00:53:34,568 --> 00:53:40,365
The dead exist in the past...
and I must tend to the future.

677
00:53:45,203 --> 00:53:49,249
Set the soothsayer free.
She's no use to me.

678
00:53:49,416 --> 00:53:53,044
Goodbye, Shen.
I wish you happiness.

679
00:53:53,211 --> 00:53:55,922
Happiness must be taken.

680
00:53:57,549 --> 00:53:59,926
And I will take mine.

681
00:54:21,823 --> 00:54:24,576
- Hurry it up!
- Move it!

682
00:54:25,702 --> 00:54:28,830
If all of those weapons
leave the building, China will fall.

683
00:54:28,997 --> 00:54:33,293
- We bring down the building.
- Hey, guys. How about this?

684
00:54:35,921 --> 00:54:38,089
- This will work!
- All right, let's go.

685
00:54:38,256 --> 00:54:39,758
I can't feel my face.

686
00:54:55,232 --> 00:54:58,193
Did you hear him call it
Year of the Peacock?

687
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,612
- Hey.
- Hey.

688
00:55:00,779 --> 00:55:02,280
OK. So, keep it cool.
Keep it cool. Keep it cool.

689
00:55:02,447 --> 00:55:04,908
You! Where are you going?

690
00:55:06,993 --> 00:55:10,455
On your feet! And wipe those
stupid grins off your faces.

691
00:55:23,885 --> 00:55:27,681
Move, you dogs!
Faster, faster! Load them all!

692
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:39,985
Greetings, panda.

693
00:55:43,572 --> 00:55:46,575
- Tell me what happened that night.
- What night?

694
00:55:46,741 --> 00:55:49,744
- That night.
- Ah, that night.

695
00:55:49,911 --> 00:55:52,914
Yes! We're talking
about the same night, right?

696
00:55:53,832 --> 00:55:57,627
Yes, I was there. Yes. I watched
as your parents abandoned you.

697
00:55:57,794 --> 00:56:02,382
It's a terrible thing.
I believe it went something like this.

698
00:56:12,517 --> 00:56:13,977
Here's your New Year's gift.

699
00:56:14,144 --> 00:56:16,313
Hope you like it,
'cause you can't return it.

700
00:56:18,189 --> 00:56:20,567
Po? What's he doing here?

701
00:56:21,484 --> 00:56:22,736
Return it! Return it!

702
00:56:34,789 --> 00:56:37,375
Are you willing to die
to find the truth?

703
00:56:37,542 --> 00:56:41,087
You bet I am.
Although I'd prefer not to.

704
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:05,570
We got them. Go!

705
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:28,802
You looking for me?

706
00:57:35,809 --> 00:57:37,602
I said that too soon, didn't I?

707
00:57:46,027 --> 00:57:47,195
Po!

708
00:57:51,950 --> 00:57:53,493
Po, get away from him.

709
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:55,620
I'll get up. Here we go.

710
00:57:58,415 --> 00:58:01,084
- No more running, Shen.
- So it seems.

711
00:58:01,251 --> 00:58:03,253
Now... answers.

712
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:06,172
Oh, you want to know so badly.

713
00:58:06,798 --> 00:58:10,009
You think knowing will heal you, huh?

714
00:58:10,176 --> 00:58:14,222
Fill some crater in your soul?

715
00:58:14,389 --> 00:58:16,558
Well, here's your answer.

716
00:58:16,725 --> 00:58:19,811
Your parents didn't love you.

717
00:58:20,854 --> 00:58:22,731
But here...

718
00:58:22,897 --> 00:58:25,567
...let me heal you!

719
00:58:31,573 --> 00:58:33,366
No!

720
00:59:47,941 --> 00:59:50,443
Yeah, like you could make me drink that.

721
00:59:54,697 --> 00:59:58,952
If I wanted you dead,
I would have left you in that river.

722
00:59:59,118 --> 01:00:03,081
- Well, why save me?
- So you can fulfill your destiny.

723
01:00:03,248 --> 01:00:06,459
What are you talking about?
Where am I?

724
01:00:08,753 --> 01:00:10,296
What is this place?

725
01:00:10,463 --> 01:00:14,467
I'm surprised you remember so little.

726
01:00:14,634 --> 01:00:18,096
But you were so little when it happened.

727
01:00:23,393 --> 01:00:25,937
Perhaps you do remember.

728
01:00:26,104 --> 01:00:28,106
What? It's just a stupid nightmare.

729
01:00:28,273 --> 01:00:30,358
Nightmare? Or memory?

730
01:01:01,306 --> 01:01:03,933
This was a thriving village.

731
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:07,645
Young Shen was in line
to rule Gongmen City.

732
01:01:07,812 --> 01:01:09,647
But he wanted more.

733
01:01:09,814 --> 01:01:15,570
I foretold that someone would stand
in his way. A panda.

734
01:01:15,737 --> 01:01:19,699
But I never could have foretold
what came next.

735
01:01:32,879 --> 01:01:34,297
Get them all!

736
01:01:41,054 --> 01:01:44,349
Take our son and run away! Go!

737
01:01:57,904 --> 01:02:01,532
Stop fighting. Let it flow.

738
01:04:05,448 --> 01:04:09,535
Your story may not have
such a happy beginning,

739
01:04:09,702 --> 01:04:12,830
but that doesn't
make you who you are.

740
01:04:12,997 --> 01:04:15,541
It is the rest of your story.

741
01:04:16,375 --> 01:04:18,544
Who you choose to be.

742
01:04:50,701 --> 01:04:54,080
So, who are you, panda?

743
01:05:02,338 --> 01:05:03,756
I am Po.

744
01:05:05,550 --> 01:05:07,510
And I'm gonna need a hat.

745
01:05:16,936 --> 01:05:19,897
Such sad, sad faces.

746
01:05:20,481 --> 01:05:22,775
But now is a time only for joy.

747
01:05:22,942 --> 01:05:26,988
You are going to be part
of something beautiful.

748
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:33,244
Once we reach the harbour,
in front of all the world,

749
01:05:33,411 --> 01:05:37,582
you and your precious kung fu will die.

750
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:44,672
Then China will know to bow before me.

751
01:05:44,839 --> 01:05:46,507
Set sail!

752
01:05:57,768 --> 01:05:59,187
What is that?

753
01:06:19,665 --> 01:06:22,835
Honestly, guys,
I never thought I'd die like this.

754
01:06:23,002 --> 01:06:26,005
I always thought I'd meet
a nice girl and settle down and...

755
01:06:26,172 --> 01:06:27,924
...then she'd eat my head.

756
01:06:28,090 --> 01:06:30,509
- So sad.
- We cannot give up hope.

757
01:06:30,676 --> 01:06:35,223
Po would want us to remain strong.
Hard-core. Right, Tigress?

758
01:06:43,189 --> 01:06:47,151
- Lord Shen, what about the bridge?
- Nothing stands in my way.

759
01:06:47,860 --> 01:06:49,111
Fire!

760
01:06:58,329 --> 01:07:00,164
You coward!

761
01:07:10,174 --> 01:07:11,175
Po?

762
01:07:13,594 --> 01:07:14,595
Po?

763
01:07:16,889 --> 01:07:21,852
How many times do I have to kill
the same stinking panda?

764
01:07:31,445 --> 01:07:32,863
Shen!

765
01:07:33,030 --> 01:07:37,076
A panda stands between you
and your destiny.

766
01:07:37,785 --> 01:07:38,828
What?

767
01:07:38,995 --> 01:07:43,040
Prepare yourself for a
hot serving of justice.

768
01:07:43,207 --> 01:07:44,834
Your reign of terror comes to an end.

769
01:07:45,001 --> 01:07:48,254
- What?
- And now, free the Five!

770
01:07:48,421 --> 01:07:50,506
Disc of Destruction!

771
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:04,520
OK. Take aim!

772
01:08:15,823 --> 01:08:17,450
Ready?

773
01:08:38,387 --> 01:08:40,348
You can't follow me.

774
01:08:40,514 --> 01:08:41,599
Just get him!

775
01:08:46,896 --> 01:08:48,647
- Yeah. Here we go.
- Come on!

776
01:08:55,905 --> 01:08:57,281
- No, no, no, don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!

777
01:08:57,448 --> 01:08:58,491
No, don't shoot!

778
01:08:58,657 --> 01:09:01,077
- Don't shoot!
- Don't shoot!

779
01:09:01,243 --> 01:09:03,662
- You don't shoot!
- I won't shoot if you won't shoot.

780
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:07,083
Yeah!

781
01:09:07,249 --> 01:09:10,127
- Don't shoot! Cross fire!
- Attack!

782
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:18,761
- Catch of Freedom!
- Monkey!

783
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:26,310
Impressive, Dragon Warrior.
What's your plan?

784
01:09:26,477 --> 01:09:29,021
- Step one, free the Five.
- What's step two?

785
01:09:29,188 --> 01:09:30,606
Honestly, I didn't think
I'd make it this far.

786
01:09:30,773 --> 01:09:31,774
Po!

787
01:09:31,941 --> 01:09:34,110
Stop Shen before he gets to the harbour.

788
01:09:39,657 --> 01:09:40,658
Nice!

789
01:09:43,244 --> 01:09:44,578
Viper, Puppet of Death!

790
01:09:45,329 --> 01:09:46,330
Tigress!

791
01:09:55,005 --> 01:09:57,007
- Master Ox!
- Jump!

792
01:09:57,174 --> 01:09:59,677
- And Croc!
- Vengeance is served.

793
01:09:59,844 --> 01:10:02,680
- Why did you...?
- Your friend there is very persuasive.

794
01:10:10,312 --> 01:10:11,522
Master Shifu!

795
01:10:13,858 --> 01:10:16,193
Quickly. Use their boats
to block the way.

796
01:10:27,037 --> 01:10:28,038
Crane!

797
01:10:28,998 --> 01:10:30,916
Wings of Justice!

798
01:10:33,002 --> 01:10:34,211
Yeah!

799
01:10:40,342 --> 01:10:41,385
What?

800
01:10:51,395 --> 01:10:55,483
I love you guys.

801
01:11:04,408 --> 01:11:06,076
Why aren't we firing?

802
01:11:06,243 --> 01:11:09,663
They're taking out our gunners, sir.
They're getting close.

803
01:11:11,457 --> 01:11:14,418
Fire! Fire at them!

804
01:11:15,085 --> 01:11:18,672
- But, sir, we'll kill our own.
- I said fire at them!

805
01:11:18,839 --> 01:11:19,882
Fire!

806
01:11:22,551 --> 01:11:23,552
No.

807
01:11:31,185 --> 01:11:32,478
Po!

808
01:12:08,055 --> 01:12:09,181
Tigress?

809
01:12:59,023 --> 01:13:00,733
As you wish.

810
01:13:00,899 --> 01:13:02,526
Let's finish this.

811
01:13:26,216 --> 01:13:27,426
Fire!

812
01:13:32,473 --> 01:13:34,308
<i><font color="#80FFFF">Inner peace.</i></font>

813
01:14:01,794 --> 01:14:02,795
Again!

814
01:14:10,135 --> 01:14:11,136
Yeah!

815
01:14:12,429 --> 01:14:15,391
Kill him! Somebody kill him!

816
01:14:37,579 --> 01:14:39,998
What? No. No!

817
01:14:46,630 --> 01:14:49,633
Keep firing! Keep firing!

818
01:15:10,279 --> 01:15:11,780
Skadoosh.

819
01:15:42,019 --> 01:15:43,353
How did you...?

820
01:15:44,772 --> 01:15:46,398
How did you do it?

821
01:15:50,360 --> 01:15:52,863
You know, you just keep your elbows up
and keep the shoulders loose.

822
01:15:53,030 --> 01:15:56,200
Not that. How did you find peace?

823
01:15:56,366 --> 01:16:00,037
I took away your parents. Everything.

824
01:16:00,204 --> 01:16:02,581
I scarred you for life.

825
01:16:03,207 --> 01:16:06,710
See, that's the thing, Shen.
Scars heal.

826
01:16:06,877 --> 01:16:10,881
No, they don't. Wounds heal.

827
01:16:11,048 --> 01:16:13,467
Oh, yeah. What do scars do?
They fade, I guess?

828
01:16:13,634 --> 01:16:18,055
- I don't care what scars do.
- You should, Shen.

829
01:16:18,222 --> 01:16:22,142
You gotta let go of that stuff from
the past, 'cause it just doesn't matter.

830
01:16:22,309 --> 01:16:26,814
The only thing that matters
is what you choose to be now.

831
01:16:26,980 --> 01:16:28,398
You're right.

832
01:16:28,565 --> 01:16:30,943
Then I choose... this!

833
01:17:23,745 --> 01:17:25,956
That was pretty hard-core.

834
01:17:35,299 --> 01:17:36,383
- Po!
- You did it!

835
01:17:36,550 --> 01:17:39,636
- Come here! Yeah!
- Don't ever do that again, please.

836
01:17:39,803 --> 01:17:43,473
It seems you have found inner peace.

837
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:45,976
And at such a young age.

838
01:17:46,143 --> 01:17:48,020
Well, I had a pretty good teacher.

839
01:18:08,999 --> 01:18:12,669
What do you mean he's not here?
It's my son's birthday.

840
01:18:12,836 --> 01:18:15,213
All he wanted was to meet
the Dragon Warrior.

841
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:18,133
How about some tofu birthday cake
instead, huh?

842
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:21,136
You know, I think we'll
just try again another time.

843
01:18:21,303 --> 01:18:22,679
When do you think he'll be back?

844
01:18:25,641 --> 01:18:29,645
I don't know. OK, I don't know.
Maybe never.

845
01:18:29,811 --> 01:18:33,148
I mean, I worry, OK?
But that's my job, I'm his dad.

846
01:18:33,315 --> 01:18:35,525
At least, I was his dad.

847
01:18:35,692 --> 01:18:39,363
Why did he have to go and save China?
I know why.

848
01:18:39,529 --> 01:18:43,200
But why? He's just one little panda.

849
01:18:58,715 --> 01:19:02,511
So, how did it go?
Did you save China?

850
01:19:03,512 --> 01:19:04,888
Yep.

851
01:19:05,055 --> 01:19:07,349
Well, I knew you would.

852
01:19:07,516 --> 01:19:09,267
That's why I had new signs made.

853
01:19:09,434 --> 01:19:11,687
"My son saved China.
You, too, can save.

854
01:19:11,853 --> 01:19:14,398
Buy one dumpling, get one free."

855
01:19:14,564 --> 01:19:15,899
Hey, that's a pretty good deal.

856
01:19:16,066 --> 01:19:18,735
- Would you like to try one?
- Maybe later.

857
01:19:21,530 --> 01:19:23,615
There's something I should tell you.

858
01:19:26,410 --> 01:19:30,831
While I was gone,
I found the village where I was born.

859
01:19:32,541 --> 01:19:35,919
I found out how I ended up
in that radish basket.

860
01:19:36,086 --> 01:19:37,713
You did?

861
01:19:38,547 --> 01:19:42,467
- I know who I am.
- You do?

862
01:19:44,469 --> 01:19:46,096
I'm your son.

863
01:19:52,227 --> 01:19:53,854
I love you, Dad.

864
01:19:54,896 --> 01:19:56,773
I love you, too, son.

865
01:20:00,819 --> 01:20:02,863
Delicious, fat radishes!

866
01:20:03,030 --> 01:20:05,157
You're probably hungry.
Let me make you something to eat.

867
01:20:05,323 --> 01:20:07,075
What are you talking about? I'll cook.

868
01:20:07,242 --> 01:20:08,660
- No, no, I'll cook.
- Dad!

869
01:20:08,827 --> 01:20:10,954
Well, it's the least I can do.
You saved China.

870
01:20:11,121 --> 01:20:13,457
No, it's the least I can do.
You raised me.

871
01:20:13,623 --> 01:20:14,624
- Po.
- Dad.

872
01:20:14,791 --> 01:20:16,251
- Po!
- OK.

873
01:20:16,418 --> 01:20:19,046
Let's both cook. Together.

874
01:20:19,212 --> 01:20:20,505
Together.

875
01:20:20,672 --> 01:20:22,257
No, I'll cook.

876
01:20:57,167 --> 01:20:59,586
My son is alive.
