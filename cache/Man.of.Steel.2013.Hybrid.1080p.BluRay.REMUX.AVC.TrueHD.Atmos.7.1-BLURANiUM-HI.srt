<i>This is a genesis chamber.</i>

00:47:04,406 --> 00:47:07,534
All Kryptonians were conceived
in chambers such as this.

489
00:47:07,784 --> 00:47:11,496
Every child was designed to fulfill
a pre-determined role in our society...

490
00:47:11,747 --> 00:47:12,747
...as a worker...

...a warrior, a leader and so on.

492

Your mother and I believed Krypton
lost something precious.

493

The element of choice, of chance.

494
00:47:22,424 --> 00:47:24,593
What if a child dreamed
of becoming something...

495
00:47:24,843 --> 00:47:27,346
...other than what society
had intended for him or her?

496
00:47:28,889 --> 00:47:31,475
What if a child aspired
to something greater?

497
00:47:32,267 --> 00:47:34,269
You were the embodiment
of that belief, Kal.

498

Krypton's first natural birth
in centuries.

to save you.

Why didn't you come with me?

501

We couldn't, Kal.

502

Your mother, Lara, and I...

506
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:00,128
...were a product of the failures
of our world as much as Zod was...

You can embody
the best of both worlds.

A dream your mother and
I dedicated our lives to preserve.

from us, it's true.

The symbol of the house of El
means hope.

519

Embodied within that hope
is the fundamental belief...

02:10:11,263 --> 02:10:13,390
- Get in the car, captain.
- Mm-hm. Yes, sir.

MARTHA: He always believed
you were meant for greater things.

And that when the day came...

1445
02:10:28,572 --> 02:10:31,366
...your shoulders would be able
to bear the weight.

1446
02:10:31,616 --> 02:10:35,454
Yeah, I just wish he could have
been here to see it finally happen.

1447
02:10:35,912 --> 02:10:37,873
He saw it, Clark, believe me.

1449
02:11:28,465 --> 02:11:32,177
- Have you given any thought to that?
- I have, actually. Heh, heh.

1450
02:11:33,804 --> 02:11:37,808
I gotta find a job
where I can keep my ear to the ground.

Come on, Lois.
When are you gonna throw me a bone?

Courtside seats to the game tonight.

1456
02:12:09,673 --> 02:12:11,216
- What do you say?
- I say...

1457
02:12:11,466 --> 02:12:14,010
...you should go back
to trolling the intern pool.

1458
02:12:14,261 --> 02:12:17,639
You'll probably have more luck.
Sorry.

1459
02:12:19,433 --> 02:12:20,349
Courtside?

- LOIS: Don't. Ha, ha, ha.
- No.

02:12:22,310 --> 02:12:25,105
Lombard, Lane,
I want you to meet our new stringer.

1462
02:12:25,355 --> 02:12:28,567
I want you to show him the ropes.
This is Clark Kent.

1463
02:12:28,817 --> 02:12:30,110
Good luck, kid.

Hey. Steve.
