1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:06,649
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:10,765
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,406
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,567
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,805
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,523
...but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,163
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,931
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,282
Previously on The Flash:

10
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,643
Ronnie was vaporized
in the accelerator when it went critical.

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,286
Ronnie's alive. I saw him, Cisco.

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,720
Firestorm.

13
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,849
I wanted to talk to you about Firestorm.

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,247
We had some success
with our stage-one testing.

15
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,448
- Professor Stein...
- Professor Martin Stein?

16
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,971
He was our team leader.

17
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,810
I know what really happened to him.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,082
In the mass of energy. Looks like...
Ronnie.

19
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,409
- And Professor Stein.
- The dark matter merged them together.

20
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,566
So how does a superhero
get ready for a date?

21
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,922
Same as everybody else.

22
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,967
All right.

23
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:26,051
Everyone tells you to just be yourself.

24
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,281
But who is that really?

25
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,602
You change one more time,
I'm gonna shoot you.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,074

27
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,685
Punctual.

28
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,926
Ye... Yeah, that is what my
friends call me. Mr. Punctual.

29
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,330
Is that lonely-looking flower for me?

30
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,527
Is this dumb?

31
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,883
I thought about getting a full bouquet,
but I thought that was weird.

32
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,690
No.

33
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,331
It's awesome.

34
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,686
All right.

35
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,726
Mm.

36
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,766
Yes!

37
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,485
Victory.

38
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,331
I told you these were the spiciest tacos
in Central City.

39
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,091
- I thought you were bluffing.
- I never bluff.

40
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,682
Just say it.
I am the champion of all things spicy.

41
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:34,090
You are the spice champion of Central City.

42
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,089
Well, this requires soap and water.

43
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,083
- I'll be right back.
- Mm-hm.

44
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,406
H9)'-

45
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,610
Robbery at the convenient store
on Brand and Paulson.

46
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,686
Oh, man, come on.
I'm kind of on a date.

47
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,769
Can't the cops get this one?

48
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,088
Fine. But when you read
in the paper tomorrow...

49
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,686
...about that poor little old lady
getting robbed...

50
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,290
- How do you know it's a little old lady?
- Please. It's always a little old lady.

51
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,971
Okay. All right.

52
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,130
No little old lady.

53
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,560
Your move, Allen.

54
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,444
What's next?

55
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,685
So, what's wrong with you?

56
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,207
Why hasn't someone snatched you up yet?

57
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,048
Uh, it's work. Just a sec.

58
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,004
H9)'-

59
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,369
- Hello.
- Hey, I know you're on a date...

60
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,841
...but we got a jumper on 52nd and Waid.

61
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,406
Sir, please, you have
everything to live for.

62
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,602
No, I don't.

63
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,920
- Are you gonna let me go back up there?
- No.

64
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,049
Well...

65
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,005
"thanks.

66
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,804
Yeah.

67
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,089
- What was that for?
- To see if I wanted a second date.

68
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,805
And?

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,810
Let me see one more time.

70
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,723
Definitely.

71
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,290
Quentin Quale.

72
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,245
Can I help you, young man?

73
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,128
Haven't been called that
in quite some time.

74
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,405
I'm sorry, do I know you?

75
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,805
We went to school together.

76
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,847
- You're one of my students.
- No.

77
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,451
Classmates.

78
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,570
University of Chicago, class of '74.

79
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,205
We protested the war.

80
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,927
"Make love, not napalm." Remember?

81
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,771
Look, I don't know
if this is some kind of practical joke.

82
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,002
I know about your brother.

83
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,649
- The truth is, he committed suicide.
- What?

84
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,842
You found the body.

85
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:13,490
- I never told anyone about that.
- You've told one person.

86
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,165
Martin?

87
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,727
I need you to help me.

88
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,126
Dude, you're a crime-fighting,
lady-slaying machine.

89
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,926
Oh, God, it was so cool.
She was so cool.

90
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,044
- We're going on another date tonight.
- Tonight, really?

91
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,811
Aren't you worried about moving too fast?

92
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,650
No. What do you mean?

93
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,966
It's a second date.

94
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,640
No, no, no, I meant going too fast.

95
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,887
Hurrying?

96
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,924
Look, you're fast,
but there's fast, and then there's fast.

97
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,049
- Am I being subtle?
- Really not.

98
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,124
Cisc0's right. With your increased
blood flow and heart rate...

99
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,442
...theoretically,
your speed can cause you to...

100
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,211
You're gonna need to think
about a lot of dead puppies.

101
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,169
Like we're talking a whole kennel.

102
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,807
And baseball. Cold showers.
You know what? Nuns.

103
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,924
- It is just a second date.
- A second date?

104
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,884
With Who?

105
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,730
Uh, with Linda Park, the sports reporter.

106
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,605
- Hello.
- That's great.

107
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,848
Linda seems great, and you're great.

108
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:23,281
So great. Heh.

109
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:27,527
- Great.
- Hey, I gotta go. I gotta help out a friend.

110
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,644
- Everything okay? We just got here.
- Yeah. I'll see you later.

111
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,561
Quale was attacked near
his lab at Concordance Research last night.

112
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,888
There were several
unsubstantiated reports...

113
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,249
...of the so-called Burning Man in the area
following the attack.

114
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,521
Burning Man?

115
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,682
Caitlin, weren't you asking about him
a few weeks ago?

116
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,167
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

117
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,965
- Thanks for meeting me.
- Sure.

118
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,162
What exactly are we doing here?

119
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,203
That's Barry's old house.

120
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,805
Where his mother was murdered?

121
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,248
I have a theory about who might've
been involved in his mother's death.

122
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,488
Thought you and I
could re-examine the scene.

123
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,564
You could apply your expertise,
and help me prove who did it.

124
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,081
We should get Dr. Wells and Caitlin in
on this.

125
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,325
No, we should keep this between us. if too
many people know, Barry will find out.

126
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,729
I don't wanna involve him
until we know something definitive.

127
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,963
Hello, ma'am. I'm Detective West.

128
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,367
This is Cisco Ramon.

129
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,722
Please, it's Sherry. Like the drink.

130
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,208
- What can I do for you, detective?
- I don't know if you're aware...

131
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,449
...but there was a homicide
in this residence 15 years ago.

132
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,564
- Oh, I know.
- We've re-opened the investigation.

133
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,604
Do you mind if we come in
and take another look around?

134
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,447
Not at all.

135
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,644
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

136
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,802
- You live alone?
- Yes, I'm divorced.

137
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,090
Well, it appears letting Ronnie roam free
is no longer an option.

138
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,203
He's not even Ronnie anymore.

139
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,643
He's Martin Stein
walking around in Ronnie's body.

140
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,126
Like a vampire.

141
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,723
Is there a reason Stein's brain is in control
of Ronnie's body, not the other way around?

142
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,370
Simple Darwinism, I suspect.

143
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:28,844
A brand new organism will select the strongest
parts of itself in order to survive.

144
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,246
Survival of the fittest.

145
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,642
In this case, Ronnie's body, Stein's mind.

146
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:37,368
But any event, he badly hurt an innocent man
and we have hunted meta-humans for less.

147
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,971
Caitlin...

148
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:43,161
...we need to know that you're on board
with what needs to be done here.

149
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,930
How do we find him?

150
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,769
Quentin Quale...

151
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,561
...the scientist that Ronnie attacked
is a former colleague of Martin Stein.

152
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:56,565
If Martin is indeed in control
of Ronnie's body...

153
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,485
...he may be trying to figure out
what's happening to him.

154
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,685
What do we know about him?
I don't even know what Stein looks like.

155
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,769
Martin Stein.

156
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,482
- That's Stein?
- It is.

157
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,684
- I've seen him before.
- When?

158
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,842
On the train,
the day the accelerator exploded.

159
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,842
Super cool, isn't it?

160
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,082
Uh, S.T.A.R. Labs, I mean.

161
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:33,931
Yes, it's super cool.

162
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,444
Trust Harrison Wells to build
a particle accelerator with a bit of style.

163
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,971
Most scientists don't have an appreciation
for the value of aesthetics.

164
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,845
Albert Einstein said,
"Once you can accept the universe...

165
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,761
...as being something expanding into
an infinite nothing which is something..."

166
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,611
"Wearing stripes with plaid
comes easy."

167
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,724
I thought people your age didn't read
actual books anymore.

168
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,446
- I'm the only one.
- Oh.

169
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,570
Physics. Hobby or endeavor?

170
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,761
Both, actually.

171
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,004
I'm a CSI. I work for the
Central City Police Department.

172
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,124
Really? You look too young for that.

173
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,440
That is what they tell me.

174
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,490
Are you gonna watch the accelerator
turn on tonight?

175
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,971
I wouldn't miss it.

176
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,162
They say it's gonna change the world.

177
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,526
I hope so.

178
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,802
Carson Station. Carson Station.

179
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,684
This is my stop.

180
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,644
- It was nice talking to you.
- You too.

181
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,327
Maybe I will see you there tonight.
Excuse me.

182
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,967
I'm taking a girlfriend-Not my girlfriend.
She's just, uh...

183
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,247
Sorry.

184
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,521
She's a female friend.

185
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,131
Who I'm not dating. Yet.

186
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,243
- The doors are about to close.
- Yeah.

187
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,086
Bye.

188
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,524
Don't turn it on!

189
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,529
Don't turn it on!

190
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,524
Don't turn it on!

191
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,491
Don't turn it on! Don't turn...

192
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,011
Caitlin, whatever happens...

193
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,447
Of course I've heard of S.T.A.R Labs.

194
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,809
Martin was always vocal
about the competition.

195
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,850
S.T.A.R. Labs is helping
the C.C.P.D. looking...

196
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,486
...into your husband's disappearance,
Mrs. Stein.

197
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,762
Oh, please, call me Clarissa.

198
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,368
The Conway Prize
for Scientific Advancement.

199
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,040
Martin was very proud of that one.

200
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,447
Well, I always hoped to win
one of these myself.

201
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,564
Oh, and look at that,
he won it three times.

202
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,522
Takes a special kind of person
to make Dr. Wells jealous.

203
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,361
Martin had a talent
for making people jealous.

204
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,005
Even me.

205
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,568
I sometimes think Martin loved his theorems
and experiments...

206
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,246
...more than he did me.

207
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,167
I'm sure that's not true.

208
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,167
And you haven't heard from your husband
since he disappeared?

209
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,161
No.

210
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,526
Mrs. Stein, could I show you a photograph?

211
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,848
Have you seen this person before?

212
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,609
Yes, I have.

213
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,207
Who is he?

214
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,687
Um...

215
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,127
He's a person of interest
in your husband's case.

216
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,085
When did you see him?

217
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,203
I started getting the feeling
that someone was watching me.

218
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,568
Sometimes I still do.

219
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,287
And about a month
after Martin disappeared...

220
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,282
...that young man showed up here.

221
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,284
What happened to me?

222
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,888
It's a month...

223
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,162
Clarissa.

224
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,086
Clarissa.

225
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,449
Who are you?

226
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,610
How did you get in here?

227
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,802
The loose stone,
you leave a key for me there.

228
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,722
I'm always losing my keys.
Losing my mind.

229
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,366
- I'm going to call the police.
- This isn't my body.

230
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,928
Where's my body?

231
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,961
I see my life but I can't reach it.

232
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,324
Please send someone.
There's an intruder in my house.

233
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,768
It appears Martin Stein and Ronnie Raymond
have something in common...

234
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,246
...besides sharing a body.

235
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,125
They both feel the need to protect
the women they love.

236
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,847
Clarissa said she feels like
she's being watched.

237
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,491
Well, then...

238
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,648
...this has all the makings of a stakeout.

239
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,844
But Barry's got a date tonight.

240
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,924
- I'll cancel.
- No. No, go.

241
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,289
If we need you here, something tells me
you can get back in a hurry.

242
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,491
I'm not picking up anything.
Not even with the super light.

243
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,766
Super light?

244
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,651
It's a multispectrum ultraviolet laser
enhanced scanner...

245
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,770
...that detects molecular schisms
in the 600-megavolt range...

246
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,161
...but I figured "super light"
was easier to say.

247
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,646
But what does it tell you?

248
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,007
Nothing we didn't already know
about that night.

249
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,321
Okay, keep looking.

250
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:39,644
Ahem. Uh, can I get you boys
something to drink?

251
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,404
Water? Soda?

252
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,731
Wine?

253
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,648
We're fine. Thank you.

254
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,001
Well, if you change your mind, I've been
told my strawberry daiquiris are sinful.

255
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,406
- I will not judge you.
- Okay...

256
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:03,450
Barry's mother's body was found here.
Knife beside her.

257
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,041
Blood spatter on the wall
belonged to Nora.

258
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,322
Joe, I think...

259
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,841
I just think maybe it's been too long.

260
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,849
And everything's different.

261
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,165
Except that mirror.

262
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,250
Sherry must've bought
it at the estate sale.

263
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:25,569
Oh, my God.

264
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,444
Silver nitrate.

265
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,284
The compound used in photography.

266
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,201
It was often used to back vintage mirrors.

267
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,971
If there were two speedsters there
that night...

268
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,443
...the sparks from their movement
would've generated enough flashes...

269
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,126
...to actually expose images
onto the silver nitrate.

270
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,211
- Are you saying what I think your saying?
- This mirror might contain photographs...

271
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,931
...of what actually happened that night.

272
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:56,611
Hey, you look great.

273
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,202
Well, I have a big date tonight
and I kind of wanted to impress the guy.

274
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:05,122
I think I can speak for that guy
and say that he is super impressed.

275
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,366
So this is your place?
It's awesome.

276
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:12,404
Yeah. Well, not entirely. I grew up here.

277
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,331
- Is it really lame, that I live at home?
- Mm, not at all.

278
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,364
- I still live with my parents.
- Really?

279
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,002
No. That would be so lame.

280
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,004
Ha, ha. All right, so here's the plan:

281
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,402
First, a dinner reservation at Paper Clip.

282
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,840
Then a round of mini golf.

283
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,083
Followed by Mal Duncan,
who's playing at an underground jazz club.

284
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,925
But my foster dad has connections there
so he hooked us up.

285
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,771
And if you're not sick of me by then,
we can get Froyo.

286
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,604
Or...

287
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,082
Want some of my fries?

288
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:49,569
No, thanks. Why would he come back here?

289
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,961
Because this is his home.

290
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,287
I don't mean the actual house.

291
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,284
I mean Clarissa. She's his home.

292
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,687
And we all wanna go home again.

293
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,841
Where we feel safe.

294
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,488
Where we feel loved.

295
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,608
Ronnie's your home.

296
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,163
Not anymore.

297
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,124
Remember what I told you on your first day
at S.T.A.R. Labs?

298
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,882
"A scientist's work is never finished."

299
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:29,290
His work is never finished. My work did
this to Ronnie, did this to Martin Stein.

300
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,807
But it's not finished, and it won't be...

301
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,809
...until we bring them both home.

302
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,563
So I'm assuming you have Barry
on speed dial?

303
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,406
Mm. Wow.

304
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,562
What's wrong? That felt amazing.

305
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,888
I just got a little excited.

306
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,482
- I would hope so.
- Sorry, Linda, I'm just, urn...

307
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,967
...a little worried about, urn...

308
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,481
...moving too fast.

309
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:11,609
It's okay. I hate slow.

310
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,686
Denying every tear

311
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,410
I'm sorry, I should check
just in case it's an emergency. Aah!

312
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,170
Okay.

313
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,607
I'm so sorry. It's important.

314
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,809
Not that this isn't important.

315
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,525
It's just that, um...

316
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,650
...this other thing is time-sensitive.

317
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:45,362
But otherwise there's no way
that I would be leaving you.

318
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,490
No one in their right mind would leave you.

319
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,928
Um, your shirt's on backwards.

320
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,208
Yeah, I got it. Okay.

321
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,329
I will text you, all right?

322
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,409
No, I'll call you. I'll call you.

323
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:00,564
Why don't I just... I'll just
do both, okay? I'll do both.

324
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,047
I'm so sorry.

325
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,805
Professor Stein.

326
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,446
Hey, I'm not here to hurt you.

327
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,887
And I know you don't wanna hurt
anyone else.

328
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,441
So if you could just not...

329
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,721
...flame on.

330
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,760
No!

331
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,646
Well, that was terrifying.

332
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,330
I sent Sherry to the movies.

333
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,967
Trust me, the best show in town
is gonna be in here tonight.

334
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:38,481
So you can get actual photographs
from this thing?

335
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,923
The science is solid.
It works exactly like an old film camera.

336
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,408
I developed the mirror backing,
and fortunately for us...

337
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,001
...the lightning went off
about 10 times that night.

338
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,928
- Multiple exposures.
- Now you're getting it.

339
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,841
I went ahead and enhanced them digitally,
and just for kicks...

340
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,089
...decided to extrapolate a 3D hologram
from the original 2D.

341
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,210
- Cisco.
- Lights...

342
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,846
...camera, action.

343
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,290
Wow.

344
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,325
Can you play it again, slower?

345
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,126
There, there. You see that?

346
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,010
Next frame.

347
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,088
This wallpaper is new.

348
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,411
Oh, man.

349
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,885
Is that blood?

350
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,005
We had a husband holding
the same weapon that killed his wife.

351
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,282
We weren't looking for any other suspects.

352
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,405
That blood belongs to one of the two
speedsters that was here that night.

353
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,924
Maybe the one that killed Nora.

354
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,930
I'll get a sample kit.

355
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,603
L 90'! you.

356
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,969
- That's great.
- Linda.

357
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,770
_H6Y-
_H6Y-

358
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,486
- So I hope it's cool that I came by.
- Yeah, of course.

359
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,682
I was just writing a column
on the Combines.

360
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,370
Oh, sweet, how are they doing?

361
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:45,964
Well, they were up two goals to none
last night, but then they blew it.

362
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,889
Wait, we're not talking about
hockey anymore, are we?

363
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,445
No, we're not.

364
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:56,651
Look, I'm so, so sorry
that I left you like that.

365
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,683
I'm not that kind of guy.

366
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,566
Well, let me tell you
what kind of girl I am.

367
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,047
I work in a hard business
and I work hard in it...

368
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,961
...and so I'm very picky about who I choose
to spend my free time with.

369
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,481
I chose to spend some of it with you...

370
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,923
...so tell me, Barry Allen,
did I make the right choice?

371
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:18,881
Yeah, you did, it's just that
something important came up.

372
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:24,081
Not more important than you, just sort of an
equal-level-of-importance type situation.

373
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,130
And usually I can do both...

374
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,722
...but it's just that I have to, um...

375
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,803
I have to go to work. I'm so sorry.

376
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,923
It's a police emergency.

377
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,485
Can we talk later tonight?

378
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,281
I'm not going anywhere, yet.

379
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,363
Okay, thanks.

380
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,607
- Hey.
- Hi.

381
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,849
Sorry, gotta go. Uh, hey, what's up?

382
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,644
Bye. Ha, ha.

383
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,524
Hey, can I ask you a question?

384
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,848
- Yeah, sure.
- So...

385
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:01,165
...you and Barry are like BFFs, right?
The best of BFFs.

386
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,681
Has he ever actually dated anyone before?

387
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:08,528
Because he's simultaneously surprisingly
good at it, and really, really bad at it.

388
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,281
I don't know. He's Barry.

389
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,010
What was his last girlfriend like?

390
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,807
You know, he hasn't really had a girlfriend
in a while.

391
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,321
I don't know, maybe he's
just not ready yet.

392
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,766
What do you mean?

393
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:26,727
You know, I mean, he was into someone,
an unrequited-love thing.

394
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,008
You know, he had feelings for someone...

395
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,891
...and they weren't really
reciprocated, so...

396
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,404
Yeah, maybe just give him time.

397
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,125
Sure.

398
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,324
There he is. Looks like the tracker
Barry placed on him worked.

399
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,930
Professor Stein?

400
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,169
- I told you to stay away from me.
- And I will...

401
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,842
...but there's someone else
who wants to talk to you.

402
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,690
Martin?

403
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,405
Do you know who I am?

404
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,247
Clarissa?

405
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,811
- Is it really you?
- I don't know.

406
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:17,163
I hear the other inside of me,
and he wants to go home to her.

407
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,007
But we can't.

408
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,290
I just want to be me again.

409
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,130
Martin.

410
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,131
What's my favorite color?

411
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,567
You could... You could never decide.

412
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,480
So you chose stripes.

413
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,006
You shouldn't see me like this.

414
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,521
I see you.

415
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,530
I see you, Martin.

416
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,288
These people can help you.

417
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,806
They say they can.

418
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,328
Please, let them.

419
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,929
Please, help us.

420
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,130
Well, we got him... Them. Now what?

421
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:17,644
Stein clearly thinks he can separate himself
from Ronnie's body using nuclear fission.

422
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:20,844
- What do you think?
- What do I think?

423
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,323
Is it possible? Theoretically.

424
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:28,360
Splitting an atom and splitting a man
are two very different things.

425
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,609
I don't suppose it's necessary
to point out you're all staring.

426
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,921
Our apologies.

427
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,405
It is remarkable.

428
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,444
I feel clearer than I
have since the accident.

429
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,484
- What did you give me?
- A cocktail of antipsychotics.

430
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,762
Depressants, mood stabilizers.

431
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,766
The same formula used to treat
dissociative identity disorder.

432
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,411
I assume this was your idea?

433
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,203
Very clever, Cait.

434
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,085
Don't call me that, please.

435
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,691
I apologize.

436
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,563
We'd like to run some tests on you,
if you don't mind.

437
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,603
Of course, Dr. Snow.

438
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,006
Hey, I'm so sorry
I had to run out like that again.

439
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,328
I had police business.

440
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:22,570
That's funny. I just called the station. They
said that you'd taken some personal time.

441
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,969
I'm not mad, Barry, I swear.

442
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,363
- But I do think that we should call it.
- Wait, can we talk about this?

443
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,046
- What do you mean?
- I know how hard and weird it is...

444
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,050
...to date someone new
when you're still not over someone.

445
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:38,084
- What are you talking about?
- You and Iris.

446
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,280
Me and Iris? We're not...

447
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,166
Who told you that I was hung up on Iris?

448
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:49,763
- Hey. Um...
- Hey, what's up?

449
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,170
Why would you tell Linda
that I had feelings for you?

450
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:57,046
I did not say that. Wait, did I?

451
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,164
Okay, Iris, this isn't funny.
I like this girl.

452
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,091
- I know and I am happy for you.
- Really?

453
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,926
Because, I mean, right now,
it sort of feels like...

454
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:10,125
...you don't want to be with me, and you
don't want anyone else to be with me either.

455
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,170
I've wanted nothing more than
for you to meet someone amazing.

456
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,086
And I did, and you went out of your way
to convince her that I was unavailable.

457
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,966
Look, I'm really sorry.

458
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,009
- Great.
- Do you want me to talk to her?

459
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,091
No, no, no. Absolutely not. Don't talk
to her. I'll figure this out on my own.

460
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:35,240
I just need you to know that I don't
have those feelings for you anymore.

461
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,170
Yeah, I know.

462
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,009
Okay.

463
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,002
I'll see you later.

464
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,888
Yes, yes, yes.

465
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,726
See, we got two different blood samples.

466
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,002
- One for each speedster.
- That's right.

467
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,084
One is A-positive, and the other one's
AB-negative. Super rare.

468
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,961
I'll run them both through the C.C.P.D.
criminal database, see if I get a match.

469
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,248
Can you run them against a specific person?

470
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,201
Yeah, sure, if we have something
to match it to. Who are we looking at?

471
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,641
Dr. Harrison Wells.

472
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,569
I thought we were trying to solve
Barry's mom's murder.

473
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,290
We are.

474
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,682
And I'm asking you to keep this between us.

475
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,046
You think Dr. Wells killed Barry's mom?

476
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:38,925
No way. He didn't even know Barry then.
Why would he kill his mom?

477
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,569
I don't know yet.

478
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:45,887
But I do know that Wells keeps secrets.

479
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,411
And this may be one of them.

480
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,725
Dr. Wells is a great man.

481
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:55,403
I was nothing when he gave me a job,
a chance to change my life.

482
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,291
He has helped so many people.
He's not a murderer.

483
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,607
Cisco.

484
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,648
I'm a cop. I'm good at reading people.

485
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,561
So I know I can trust
you with my suspicion.

486
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,363
When I go talk to the family and friends
of a murder suspect...

487
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,245
...somebody I know is guilty...

488
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,966
...and I tell them the person they love
is a killer...

489
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,162
...guess what they all say.

490
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,165
"That's not the person I know."

491
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,291
I think I'm done being a cop for today.

492
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,481
Are you comfortable?

493
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,250
A little warm.

494
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,926
Ronnie used to always run warm.

495
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,165
Not that warm.

496
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,204
Can I talk to him?

497
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,843
Sorry, my dear,
I'm not sure it works like that.

498
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,848
I can feel him, though.

499
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,289
I have these memories.

500
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,609
Memories that I know aren't my own.

501
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:06,331
One is particularly strong.

502
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,251
Piedmont State Park,
it's famous for the Hudson Falls.

503
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:16,131
I know that I've never been, but I can
remember those waterfalls perfectly.

504
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,682
That's where Ronnie proposed to me.

505
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,721
He loves you very much.

506
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,730
That, I can feel.

507
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,324
Dr. Snow, can we see you for a minute?

508
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,170
Excuse me.

509
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,726
- You okay?
- Yeah, it's just confusing.

510
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,645
What isn't confusing
is what's happening to him now.

511
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,644
Ronnie's body is rejecting Stein's atoms
like a host rejecting a parasite.

512
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,521
The resulting instability
is causing an exothermic reaction.

513
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,889
I worry, if his temperature
continues to rise...

514
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,883
...it'll set off a chain reaction.

515
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,208
And then what happens?

516
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,603
He could go nuclear.

517
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,931
Ronnie.

518
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,171
Not Ronnie.

519
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,204
- Martin Stein.
- Cisco Ramon.

520
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,842
Your colleagues are in the next room,
not so subtly discussing my condition.

521
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,725
That's not freaky at all.

522
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:34,363
It seems Ronnie's fight with the Flash
has exacerbated the Firestorm matrix.

523
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,204
It's unstable.

524
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:40,126
It's exponentially increasing the rate
of fission inside his body.

525
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,561
How long does he have?

526
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,969
If his temperature keeps rising
at the current pace...

527
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,290
...no more than a couple of hours.

528
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:52,161
But you can fix it, right? I mean,
you can separate them before it's too late?

529
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:56,410
Any attempt we make to separate
the two of them could be catastrophic.

530
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,648
A nuclear explosion.

531
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:03,325
And a nuclear explosion of this magnitude
would level this entire city.

532
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,289
Unless...

533
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,331
Unless what?

534
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:10,526
Unless the host body
were no longer functional.

535
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,730
You wanna kill Ronnie?

536
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,201
No, I don't wanna kill Ronnie.

537
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,290
But in this scenario,
Ronnie is the host body.

538
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,603
If you kill Ronnie, you kill Stein.
That's two people.

539
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,206
I don't know how else to stop it.

540
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,808
And my guess is
that if Ronnie and Professor Stein...

541
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,367
...knew the consequences that
we were all facing...

542
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,289
...they would make the same decision.

543
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,728
It's two lives for millions.

544
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,610
Can you give us a minute?

545
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,326
Caitlin...
I've already lost Ronnie once.

546
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,251
I'm not gonna do it again.

547
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,726
You said we have a couple of hours.

548
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,843
Use them.

549
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,762
Dr. Wells, you don't really
think we should kill Ronnie, do you?

550
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,922
Stay here, Cisco.

551
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,405
Hey.

552
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,765
Sorry.

553
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,651
Can I get you anything, or...?

554
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:32,846
A glass of Chateau Haut-Brion
Pessac-Leognan 1982 might be nice.

555
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,524
Or maybe it wouldn't.

556
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,924
This body's taste buds
would obviously be different from my own.

557
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,441
Perhaps I'm now a light beer man.

558
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,043
There are worse things to be.

559
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,646
You mean like a living nuclear bomb?

560
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,561
You know.

561
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:55,641
Unstable nuclear fission was always a
danger in the transmutation process.

562
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,326
Plus, you all argue very loudly.

563
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,165
I'm sorry.

564
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,648
But my friends are gonna figure out
how to fix this, I promise.

565
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,770
I remember meeting you, Mr. Allen,
on the train.

566
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,450
You were headed to S.T.A.R. Labs
with a girl, but not your girlfriend.

567
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,844
Yeah.

568
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,447
I'm not sure that I have any girlfriend.

569
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,328
You know, Einstein was
not only brilliant...

570
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,006
...he had a great sense of humor.

571
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,004
How did it go?

572
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,524
"Any man who drives safely
while kissing a pretty girl...

573
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:38,607
...is not giving the pretty girl
the attention she deserves."

574
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,811
If I learned anything this past year...

575
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,122
...life's too short not to live.

576
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,603
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

577
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,922
- I gave you an out.
- I don't want an out.

578
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,168
I won't date someone who's
into someone else.

579
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,527
I'm not into anyone else.
I'll prove it to you.

580
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,644
This is a naga jolokia,
or the ghost pepper.

581
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:10,880
It is the world's hottest pepper, measuring
401.5 times hotter than Tabasco sauce.

582
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:13,486
If you do not agree
to go on another date with me...

583
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,002
...I will eat it, right here, right now.

584
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,407
You're bluffing.

585
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,884
I never bluff.

586
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,160
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine, yeah.

587
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,930
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hm.

588
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,087
Yes, yes, I'll go out with you.

589
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:38,926
- That pepper could've killed you, nerd.
- Thanks. Mm.

590
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,048
Ugh. Thank you.

591
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,209
Okay, I won't let my job...

592
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,767
...or how bad my mouth is burning right now
come between us.

593
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,960
My Spice Champion of Central City. Ha, ha.

594
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:14,127
A crude weapon, if I may say so, Dr. Wells.

595
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,601
I couldn't agree more, Gideon.

596
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,966
But it Will do the job.

597
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,810
Gideon...

598
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:34,287
...can the tachyon prototype be converted
into a quantum splicer?

599
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,643
Theoretically,
but I must warn you, Dr. Wells...

600
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,929
...converting the tachyon prototype
will delay your timetable.

601
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:45,569
There's not gonna be a timetable if Central
City goes up in a mushroom cloud.

602
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,326
Hey, anything?

603
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:53,441
I have an idea. It's a bit of a Hail Mary,
but Cisco and I are gonna give it a try.

604
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,561
- Thank you.
- I'll get Professor Stein.

605
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,250
Looking for the professor?

606
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,920
Yeah, he's gone.

607
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,563
- You guys almost done?
- Hang on, hang on.

608
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,564
I found Stein. He's in the Badlands.

609
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,644
The middle of nowhere,
30 miles outside of Central City.

610
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,604
Minimum safe distance.

611
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,404
He's sacrificing himself.

612
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,802
How much time does he have left?

613
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,684
Twelve minutes.

614
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,969
And we're done.

615
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:29,887
- What is it?
- This is a quantum splicer.

616
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,163
- Will it work to separate them?
- We'll know in 12 minutes.

617
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:35,727
Now, Barry, even you
can't outrun a nuclear blast...

618
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,608
...so you get this device to Professor Stein
and you get out of there as fast as you can.

619
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,529
- What are you doing?
- Going with you.

620
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,409
- No, you're not.
- It's too dangerous.

621
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,762
Barry doesn't know how
to operate the splicer.

622
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:50,970
- Cisco's gonna talk me through it.
- There's not enough time. Let's go.

623
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,770
Go.

624
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,730
What was that?

625
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,371
Uh, comm system's on the fritz.
I'll be right back.

626
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,165
- Cisco.
- I'm not proud of it but I ran the samples.

627
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,807
- One wasn't identified. The other had a match.
- Cisco, you're hesitating.

628
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,803
- Was it Wells?
- No, it's not Dr. Wells.

629
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,247
I told you, he has nothing to do with this.

630
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,363
But I know whose blood it is.

631
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,607
It's Barry's.

632
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,888
We already know
Barry was there that night.

633
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,128
No, no, no, you don't understand.

634
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:33,848
The sample had high levels of P-16, a protein
that builds up in the blood as we get older.

635
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,606
And these levels were way too high
for an 11-year-old.

636
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,885
This sample was from Barry as an adult.

637
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,566
Professor Stein!

638
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,968
What are you doing here? You can't be here!

639
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,764
Get her out of here now!

640
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,004
Please, look,
Ronnie's still in there somewhere.

641
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,647
All those people.
Clarissa, I won't let them die.

642
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,569
It's better I end this now.

643
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,370
We can separate you!

644
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,649
We can stop the explosion.

645
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,122
- How?
- A quantum splicer.

646
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,244
It's a fission device
designed to bombard your atoms...

647
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:27,201
...with as much energy as they experienced
in the particle accelerator explosion.

648
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,204
It should be enough to separate you.

649
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,566
Please, professor,
you have nothing left to lose.

650
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,881
Ronnie, if you're in there...

651
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,851
...I love you.

652
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,928
That was from him.

653
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,646
I look forward to meeting you
in person, professor.

654
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,251
It's not working.

655
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,764
- He's not gonna make it. He's gonna blow.
- Get out of there. Barry, get out of there now.

656
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,442
- Oh, no. No, no!
- Caitlin, we have to go.

657
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,647
Run!

658
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,326
No!

659
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,768
Sir, we have a thermonuclear detonation...

660
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,406
...approximately 30 miles northeast
of Central City.

661
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,410
Deploy the Rapid Response Team, sergeant.

662
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,762
Bring me Firestorm.

663
00:41:55,305 --> 00:42:01,492
