1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,440
Welcome to Westeros where
the fight for the kingdom is on.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,680
Anyone can die. Where great families
live and die for the Iron Throne.

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,080
They're coming.
Your heart is in your mouth.

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:16,440
Those scenes are breathtaking.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,680
Some are noble.
Jon Snow's everybody's hero.

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,280
Some are not.
Aarrgghh! Spill some blood.

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,040
I had her!
So many kings and queens

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,040
but only one can rule.
You cannot deny her strength.

9
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,960
Run! The Wall is down
and the dead are coming.

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,720
You can't have
a cliffhanger greater than that.

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,920
Oof! When's it start?

12
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,840
This is what Game Of Thrones does,
it sucks you in.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,480
So let's fly through
the saga to date

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,920
and get you ready for season eight.

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,600
As season one opens,
it's the calm before the storm.

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,680
King Robert Baratheon rules
from the capital King's Landing

17
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,360
but his days are numbered.
To be king or queen in Westeros,

18
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,920
you sit on the
Iron Throne and you rule over

19
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,440
the Seven Kingdoms
from King's Landing.

20
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,640
Start the damn joust
before I piss myself!

21
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,560
He's locked in a
loveless marriage and

22
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,880
only chose his queen for her family's
name to hold his kingdom together.

23
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,360
On Robert's part,
there's no love involved.

24
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,360
Don't you get tired?

25
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,480
Every day.

26
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,960
It could've been anybody
and it happens to be Cersei.

27
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,680
I felt something
for you once you know.

28
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,600
I'm very sympathetic to Cersei.
I know.

29
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:43,160
She was completely in love with him.
She... she was in awe of him almost

30
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,680
and he turned into
this semi-abusive drunk.

31
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,240
Was it ever possible for us?
Was there ever a time,

32
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,280
ever a moment?

33
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,920
No.

34
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,360
You may think, initially,
'Oh, that poor

35
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,880
'lady married to that terrible
man.' But don't underestimate her.

36
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:10,240
This unhappy couple have three
golden-haired children to their name

37
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,840
but Cersei keeps
a deadly secret from Robert.

38
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,520
The children are not his.

39
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,760
The truth will be discovered
on a royal trip north

40
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,480
and it's here that
our story really begins.

41
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,600
The king has asked his old ally
Ned Stark to help him rule.

42
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,960
Ned and his wife Catelyn
govern the North,

43
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,000
fiercely loyal to the crown.

44
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,080
The Starks stand for loyalty,
integrity, bravery.

45
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,240
They are really
the moral compass of the show.

46
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,280
They're the good guys
and they're the ones

47
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,640
that you find yourself
rooting for from the start.

48
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,080
The couple have five children,

49
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,120
three sons and two daughters.

50
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,240
And the decimation
of this happy family

51
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,480
will reverberate
throughout our tale.

52
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,680
They're almost too
innocent for that world.

53
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,120
King Robert arrives
with his queen Cersei

54
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,160
and with them
is the whole Lannister clan.

55
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,040
That's Jaime Lannister,
the queen's twin brother.

56
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:10,400
Oh, the Lannisters. They're blond,

57
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,520
they're beautiful,
they're arrogant, so fuck them.

58
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,720
It's the Lannisters
who are going to introduce

59
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,000
a lot of trouble into the lives
of the Starks from this point.

60
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,400
King Robert has decided to ask
Ned to be the hand of the king.

61
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,080
Nine years I haven't seen you,

62
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,440
where have you been?
Guarding the North for you.

63
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:33,320
Robert realises that he... too late,
that he's surrounded himself

64
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,920
by enemies, really.

65
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,240
The only person he can trust is Ned.

66
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,880
I need you, Ned,
down at King's Landing

67
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,120
not up here where
you're no damn use to anybody.

68
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,360
More importantly, during the visit,
Bran Stark goes climbing

69
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,680
one day, gets to the
top of the tower and

70
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,480
discovers the Lannisters'
deep dark secret.

71
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,080
(THEY GROAN)

72
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,280
The secret is that
Cersei the queen

73
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,720
is actually sleeping
with her brother Jaime.

74
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,760
The Lannisters, oh, God!

75
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,280
Ugh! Oh!

76
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,640
Pffff! They are...

77
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,160
I have never seen a family...

78
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,160
I mean, talk about dysfunctional.

79
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,840
(GROANS) Oh!

80
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,680
Stop! Stop.

81
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,600
It's incest, which,
even in Westeros,

82
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,880
is generally frowned upon. It also
means that King Robert's children

83
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,360
are not actually his children.
It's all right.

84
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,240
He saw us!
I heard you the first time.

85
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,960
He knows what it means too
and he knows that if the incest

86
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,440
is discovered, not only will he
and his sister be put to death

87
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,080
but their three children
may very well too.

88
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,240
And so for Jaime Lannister,
the greatest swordsman in Westeros,

89
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,280
there's only one solution.

90
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,560
The things I do for love.

91
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,880
Here's a convenient way.
The kid will die,

92
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,840
it'll look like he fell
and our kids will be safe.

93
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,440
First in a coma,
Bran will later awake

94
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,280
with no memory of how
he fell or what he saw.

95
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,760
The royal secret is safe
for now and only the viewer

96
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,600
has seen what the
Lannisters will do to keep it.

97
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,080
Everything went
pear-shaped after that

98
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,880
and really that's the whole
chain of events starting.

99
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:14,120
King Robert still wants Ned
down in the capital,

100
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,920
so this will be the last ever
time we see the Stark family

101
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,720
all together, a family which
includes Ned's son out of wedlock,

102
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,520
the bastard Jon Snow.
Ned must now leave his family

103
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,560
and follow King Robert south,

104
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,320
taking his daughters
Sansa and Arya with him.

105
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,960
The reason I think the first
season of Game Of Thrones works

106
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,040
is it's essentially about this
good family that just wants to

107
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,640
essentially be left alone and serve
their king and their country.

108
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,200
The family is ripped apart and thrown
into situations they never anticipated.

109
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,400
They are bound for the capital
King's Landing,

110
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,760
where Ned's new task
will be to protect King Robert

111
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,800
from those who would unseat him.

112
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,920
And in season one, viewers learned

113
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,680
the greatest enemies
live in exile overseas.

114
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:01,480
The Targaryens. They were dethroned
by King Robert in the last war.

115
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,800
The only surviving members
of the family

116
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,440
are a brother and sister
called Viserys and Daenerys.

117
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,720
The siblings are the children of
the Mad King who was killed in war.

118
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,360
Viserys dominates
his younger sister.

119
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,680
Viserys has more than a touch
of the Targaryen madness

120
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,120
and, you know,
sometimes he's protecting her

121
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,520
but he's also trying to treat
her as a... as a bargaining chip.

122
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,160
Come forward, my dear.
In search of an army,

123
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,560
Viserys makes a pact with
a savage tribe, the Dothraki.

124
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,520
Offering his beautiful young
sister in marriage to their leader,

125
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,640
Khal Drogo. She's the only
bargaining chip he has,

126
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,640
he doesn't have any wealth any more,
he doesn't have any armies

127
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,240
but he has her who he
can trade to this horse lord.

128
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,880
I would let his
whole tribe fuck you,

129
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,800
all 40,000 men and their horses
too, if that's what it took.

130
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,400
He's power hungry
but to a nasty degree.

131
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,040
He doesn't really care
how or by what means,

132
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,800
he just wants to be
important and looked up to.

133
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,840
But his plans backfire.

134
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,600
Daenerys and Khal Drogo fall in love
and become quite the power couple.

135
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,880
Suddenly, she finds herself, with Khal
Drogo, empowered. People are obeying her.

136
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,680
Tell him I want what was bargained
for or I'm taking you back.

137
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,760
He completely underestimates
not only Dany but Khal Drogo.

138
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,000
What's he saying?

139
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,040
He says yes.

140
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,720
You shall have a golden crown.

141
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,480
It's a real coming-of-age story
throughout the first season.

142
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,320
She really grows into herself.

143
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,840
Look away, Khaleesi.
No.

144
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,960
This is one of the
turning points for Daenerys.

145
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,080
I think this is when you
realise that she's prepared

146
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,760
to sacrifice anything
for the greater good.

147
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,880
A crown for a king.

148
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:57,400
Aarrgghh!

149
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,040
Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

150
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,520
Argh! Ugh! Ugh!

151
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,760
He was revolting.

152
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,240
He was utterly, utterly revolting.

153
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,280
And that was the moment that
she escaped from her shell.

154
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,680
When she became the woman
and not the kowtowed girl.

155
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,240
And as the Targaryens grow in power,

156
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,600
we learn that King Robert
faces another challenge

157
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,720
to his northernmost borders.

158
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,800
Threats which led
past rulers to build

159
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,080
this giant wall of ice
to keep out wild things beyond.

160
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,800
It's protected by the
legendary Night's Watch.

161
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,560
The Night's Watch are a small army

162
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,320
who guard the northern
border of the country.

163
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,760
In season one, there's lots
of fighting for the throne

164
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,920
but actually, in the background,
there are these creatures appearing

165
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,840
north of the Wall that nobody
has seen for thousands of years

166
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,200
and no-one wants to believe they're
there but they certainly are.

167
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:55,560
We hear the characters
saying that this is all folklore,

168
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,040
that this is all made up
but, for the viewer,

169
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,800
we see that, basically,
these characters do exist.

170
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,760
They are there.
Ugh!

171
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,720
The White Walkers
are terrifying mostly because

172
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,520
you're not 100% sure you know
what they're capable of doing

173
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,160
or what their motives are.

174
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,680
They are a serious threat.

175
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,360
In season one,
in search of a purpose,

176
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:25,960
Jon Snow ventures to the Wall
and joins the Night's Watch,

177
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,000
a leader in the making.

178
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,440
Jon Snow's everybody's hero.

179
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,720
Jon Snow's one of my favourite
characters. He's the dude.

180
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,400
He's also in search of answers.

181
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,960
The question of Jon...
Jon Snow's parentage

182
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,440
has been one of the
burning topics amongst,

183
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,560
not only the show's fans,
but book fans for many decades.

184
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,800
Jon Snow is Ned Stark's bastard son.
He brought him back from a war

185
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,880
and we never really
learned who the mother is.

186
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,280
Um, understandably,
Catelyn, Ned's wife,

187
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,320
isn't too fond of Jon
for that reason.

188
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:02,840
Try as she may, um,
she could never make peace

189
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,960
with that, with the fact
that Ned was unfaithful.

190
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,560
But down in the capital
King's Landing,

191
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,440
Ned Stark has a much
greater challenge to face.

192
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,200
His daughter has fallen
for Prince Joffrey.

193
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,360
She's presented with
marrying the future king,

194
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,400
live in a beautiful castle,
go to banquets,

195
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,520
have beautiful dresses to wear.
A fairy tale story.

196
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,720
Ned has discovered the queen
and her brother are lovers

197
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,440
and this will be
his family's undoing.

198
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,480
When the king returns from his hunt,
I'll tell him the truth.

199
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,440
You must be gone by then,
you and your children.

200
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,680
I will not have
their blood on my hands.

201
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,720
Before he gets the chance to talk to King Robert,
King Robert gets killed on a hunting trip.

202
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,840
Joffrey is now king and without
Robert to protect him,

203
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,320
Ned is tried for treason.
He confesses,

204
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,800
believing it will save his daughter
but misjudges the new ruler.

205
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,320
He's been stuck up
in the North too long

206
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,560
and has no idea how
the real world operates,

207
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,000
how to really deal with the
kind of... the politics of Westeros.

208
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,880
Bring me his head!

209
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
(SHOUTING)

210
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,840
You will not!

211
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,800
That's when you realise nobody
is safe in this world at all.

212
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,760
(SHOUTING)
No! Stop them!

213
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,760
When I saw Sean Bean pushed down...

214
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,160
..that was the only scene that
really has brought a tear to my eye.

215
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,440
It's cruel, it's heartbreaking,

216
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,800
but there's a point
to the children witnessing this.

217
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,000
If they want to survive,
they have to start to be resilient.

218
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,040
They have to learn from this.

219
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,360
It was at that moment, you realised
what Game Of Thrones was really about.

220
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,160
It's here that the
Stark family splinters.

221
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,560
Arya is whisked away by a Night's
Watch brother loyal to Ned,

222
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,440
leaving Sansa
at the mercy of Joffrey.

223
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,000
Robb Stark reacts
with murderous rage

224
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,520
to the news that his father
has been beheaded.

225
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,280
Robb's the heir and he's not only
picking up his father's mantle

226
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,040
as Lord of Winterfell but he's
picking up a much older mantle.

227
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,920
The crown that no-one has worn for
300 years, the Kingdom of the North.

228
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,200
It will lead to all-out war

229
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,240
between the Starks
and the Lannisters

230
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,640
who are led by its patriarch
Tywin Lannister.

231
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,720
Tywin Lannister is one
of the great warriors

232
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,080
and battle strategists of the age.

233
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,760
His legacy is uppermost
in his mind all of the time.

234
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,440
In these next few months,
we could establish a dynasty

235
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,480
that will last a thousand years.

236
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:35,200
Or we could collapse into nothing
like the Targaryens did.

237
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,600
All of his hopes are in Jaime.

238
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,520
As well as his twins,
Cersei and Jaime,

239
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,000
he has a son he despises,
Tyrion, known as the Imp.

240
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,960
You're wounded.
Good of you to notice.

241
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,720
Tyrion doesn't look like a warrior.
He doesn't look like a kingmaker,

242
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,960
there's no way that he can
assume the position of Tywin.

243
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,160
I hear we won. I would say Tyrion
is one of my favourite characters.

244
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:07,280
How he's managed to last
this long is amazing to me.

245
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,560
As war rages in Westeros,
over the Narrow Sea,

246
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,720
Daenerys loses a husband
but gains astonishing new powers.

247
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,320
She walks into
Khal Drogo's funeral pyre

248
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,560
with fossilised dragon's eggs.

249
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,800
Oh, what an epic scene.

250
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,840
(SCREAMING)

251
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,640
Season one ends
with the sight of Daenerys

252
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,960
emerging from a fire unscathed
with her dragons hatched.

253
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,280
These creatures
are extraordinary creatures,

254
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,320
the likes of which have not
been seen in hundreds of years.

255
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,320
Blood of my blood.

256
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,120
You see these three dragons
around her and you're, just, like,

257
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,320
they're gonna be awesome
when they're grown.

258
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:52,160
The innocence is gone, she's it.

259
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,320
You know, she's the force now.

260
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,560
As the dragons are born, she
comes more and more into her own

261
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,480
until the power
becomes innate to her.

262
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,880
It's about a new era. The whole
first season is essentially

263
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,080
the old era dying out
and the new era beginning.

264
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,880
And by the end,
she has a sense that she knows

265
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,240
that she's bound for greatness.

266
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:18,560
And after the break, watch
those dragons grow in season two.

267
00:14:21,389 --> 00:14:21,549
Welcome to Westeros where
the fight for the kingdom is on.

268
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:28,469
Welcome back to Game Of Thrones,
The Story So Far, where season two

269
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:32,349
marks a new reign of tyranny
in the capital King's Landing.

270
00:14:32,469 --> 00:14:34,509
Joffrey is brutalising his subjects

271
00:14:34,669 --> 00:14:36,909
as well as his bride-to-be,
Sansa Stark.

272
00:14:37,069 --> 00:14:39,789
You can't!
What did you say?

273
00:14:39,949 --> 00:14:43,069
Sansa has learned some
painful lessons along the way.

274
00:14:43,229 --> 00:14:46,549
The chivalrous knights and gallant
princes that she dreamed of,

275
00:14:46,709 --> 00:14:49,749
she got a gallant prince
and he turned out to be Joffrey.

276
00:14:49,909 --> 00:14:52,469
Killing you would send
your brother a message.

277
00:14:52,589 --> 00:14:53,829
(CRIES)

278
00:14:53,989 --> 00:14:58,349
She's a prisoner in the worst place
imaginable, enduring all kinds

279
00:14:58,509 --> 00:15:02,069
of psychological and sometimes
physical abuse from these captors.

280
00:15:02,189 --> 00:15:03,189
Leave her face.

281
00:15:04,549 --> 00:15:05,869
I like her pretty.

282
00:15:07,309 --> 00:15:09,069
(PUNCH)
(CRIES)

283
00:15:10,229 --> 00:15:13,749
He's a bully
and we don't like bullies.

284
00:15:13,909 --> 00:15:16,109
Joffrey is the character
throughout the series

285
00:15:16,229 --> 00:15:18,149
that the audience loves to hate.

286
00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:23,029
I heard a disgusting lie
about uncle Jaime. And you?

287
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:26,029
He's a despicable human being.

288
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:32,429
Cersei's smart enough to
realise that Joffrey is perhaps

289
00:15:32,549 --> 00:15:35,629
not what she might have hoped for

290
00:15:35,789 --> 00:15:38,749
and he's getting out of her
control now and he's a danger,

291
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:42,629
in part, even to her and even
to other members of the family.

292
00:15:42,789 --> 00:15:46,189
What you just did
is punishable by death.

293
00:15:49,389 --> 00:15:51,349
Joffrey's enemies are everywhere.

294
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:54,189
Chief amongst them, and just
across the bay at Dragonstone,

295
00:15:54,349 --> 00:15:57,229
is Stannis, brother
of the late King Robert,

296
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,269
who believes the throne
should be his.

297
00:16:01,149 --> 00:16:04,709
Stannis has learned that Robert's
children are Lannister bastards,

298
00:16:04,869 --> 00:16:07,549
which means that it is Stannis
who is next in line.

299
00:16:07,709 --> 00:16:11,749
So Stannis Baratheon, who knows King
Joffrey is the product of incest,

300
00:16:11,909 --> 00:16:15,149
decides to send ravens out to all
the corners of the Seven Kingdoms,

301
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:17,629
letting them know
the Lannister secret.

302
00:16:17,789 --> 00:16:20,269
In order to claim the throne,
Stannis enlists

303
00:16:20,389 --> 00:16:22,309
the Red Priestess, Melisandre,

304
00:16:22,469 --> 00:16:25,829
who was on her own mission to find
the right ruler for Westeros.

305
00:16:25,989 --> 00:16:29,989
She believes Stannis is the
saviour of the world, basically.

306
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:32,029
He's supposed to be
on the Iron Throne.

307
00:16:32,189 --> 00:16:35,709
And her magical powers
have no limits, I think.

308
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:38,629
There's... There's so much that
we don't know that she can do.

309
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:42,029
However, Stannis isn't the
only one after the throne.

310
00:16:42,189 --> 00:16:44,549
His younger brother, Renly,
also believes he has a claim

311
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:46,589
and so war is inevitable.

312
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:49,349
The Iron Throne is mine by right.

313
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:52,149
All those that
deny that are my foes.

314
00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:56,269
The whole realm denies it,
from Dorne to the Wall.

315
00:16:56,429 --> 00:16:59,269
They both think they should be king
but I'm on Stannis's side,

316
00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:01,509
so screw Renly.

317
00:17:01,669 --> 00:17:03,509
Rather than fight
it out on the battlefield,

318
00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:05,749
Stannis finds
another way to kill his brother.

319
00:17:05,909 --> 00:17:08,109
Family ties don't mean
an awful lot in Westeros.

320
00:17:08,269 --> 00:17:11,229
The powerful sorcery of
the Red Priestess is revealed

321
00:17:11,389 --> 00:17:13,589
when she gives birth
to a sinister weapon.

322
00:17:13,709 --> 00:17:16,269
Aarrgghh!

323
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:21,429
The shadow baby is basically
just a way to kill Renly

324
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:24,789
and it comes out of me
in a great way.

325
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:26,789
(SCREAMS)

326
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:32,189
I think Melisandre, she's
always lived by this religion.

327
00:17:33,829 --> 00:17:35,789
If she's got something to do,
she's gonna do it

328
00:17:35,949 --> 00:17:38,149
and she's not gonna let
other people stand in her way.

329
00:17:38,309 --> 00:17:40,309
What I think is brilliant
about Game Of Thrones,

330
00:17:40,469 --> 00:17:43,269
it's a fantasy world but it's
a completely realistic depiction of

331
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:47,189
how power works. What power does to
people, what people do to get power,

332
00:17:47,389 --> 00:17:51,149
what happens when they fall short, when they
miss the mark. That's why it's so brilliant.

333
00:17:51,309 --> 00:17:55,189
Ugh!
(CREATURE HISSES) Ugh-ugh!

334
00:17:55,349 --> 00:17:58,029
When Renly is murdered,
it leaves behind his widow,

335
00:17:58,189 --> 00:18:01,629
Margaery Tyrell,
who belongs to the Tyrell family,

336
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,829
who are very rich and
powerful in their own right.

337
00:18:03,989 --> 00:18:06,349
Calling yourself king
doesn't make you one

338
00:18:06,509 --> 00:18:09,549
and if Renly wasn't a king,
I wasn't a queen.

339
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:15,109
She knows how to play the game. She
really knows how to play the game.

340
00:18:15,229 --> 00:18:17,349
Do you want to be a queen?

341
00:18:17,469 --> 00:18:19,389
No.

342
00:18:20,389 --> 00:18:22,589
I want to be THE queen.

343
00:18:24,349 --> 00:18:28,349
As one would-be king is extinguished,
another rises up

344
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:32,189
as season two sees a small but
vicious family enter the fray.

345
00:18:32,349 --> 00:18:37,469
A seafaring house that commands the
greatest fleet of ships in Westeros.

346
00:18:37,629 --> 00:18:41,269
It is led by Balon Greyjoy,
whose son Theon,

347
00:18:41,429 --> 00:18:43,469
a captive of the
Starks since childhood,

348
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,509
has finally made it back home.

349
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:48,749
We take what is ours.

350
00:18:50,269 --> 00:18:53,029
Your time with the wolves
has made you weak.

351
00:18:53,189 --> 00:18:56,349
Theon Greyjoy has grown up
with the Stark family,

352
00:18:56,509 --> 00:18:59,869
he was a sort of a prisoner
from a war in the past.

353
00:19:00,029 --> 00:19:04,309
He now returns to his motherland,
which is the Iron Islands

354
00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:06,709
and decides to betray the Starks.

355
00:19:06,869 --> 00:19:09,869
You would have our father
bow down to your other family?

356
00:19:09,989 --> 00:19:12,549
I have no other family!

357
00:19:12,709 --> 00:19:15,789
Theon's sister Yara,
a battle-hardened warrior,

358
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:18,309
is now heir to the Iron Islands.

359
00:19:18,469 --> 00:19:23,189
Yara is strong and fierce.
When Theon comes back

360
00:19:23,349 --> 00:19:27,029
and stakes his claim,
she's worked too hard for this

361
00:19:27,149 --> 00:19:29,669
and is not given that up.

362
00:19:29,829 --> 00:19:33,629
To prove his loyalty,
Theon invades Winterfell.

363
00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:37,429
The ravens are informing
my father of my victory here.

364
00:19:37,589 --> 00:19:40,309
This leaves the Stark
family home in chaos

365
00:19:40,469 --> 00:19:43,469
and he takes the younger
Stark brothers captive.

366
00:19:43,629 --> 00:19:47,629
Prince Theon.
I yield to Prince Theon.

367
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:50,989
Across the Narrow Sea,
Daenerys Targaryen is learning

368
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:53,549
valuable lessons
in her quest to return

369
00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:55,909
to Westeros and seize the throne.

370
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,749
She's desperate to be a good ruler.

371
00:19:58,909 --> 00:20:01,549
That she can, you know,
go to bed at night saying,

372
00:20:01,709 --> 00:20:04,109
'I think I'm doing things
the right way.'

373
00:20:04,269 --> 00:20:07,229
As Daenerys's power grows
so do her dragons

374
00:20:07,389 --> 00:20:09,269
but as news of their
existence spreads,

375
00:20:09,389 --> 00:20:11,669
they become highly sought after.

376
00:20:11,829 --> 00:20:14,589
When she's in Qarth, everybody
kind of thinks, 'Who are you?

377
00:20:14,749 --> 00:20:18,229
'We'll just take your dragons.
And you're not powerful any more.'

378
00:20:22,829 --> 00:20:24,789
Dracarys!

379
00:20:26,629 --> 00:20:29,149
People have underestimated her
the whole way.

380
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:33,149
And it is in season two
that we finally see

381
00:20:33,269 --> 00:20:35,189
the dragons kill for Daenerys.

382
00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:36,989
Aarrgghh!

383
00:20:40,229 --> 00:20:43,869
As Daenerys gets stronger in exile,
Jon Snow and the Night's Watch

384
00:20:43,989 --> 00:20:45,909
are on a mission beyond the Wall

385
00:20:46,069 --> 00:20:49,109
where the true scale of the
threat to the kingdom is revealed.

386
00:20:49,229 --> 00:20:51,709
Blow the horn. Somebody come.

387
00:20:51,829 --> 00:20:53,869
The army of the dead is on its way

388
00:20:54,029 --> 00:20:56,989
and it's gonna kick off sooner
or later and really, you know,

389
00:20:57,149 --> 00:20:59,629
they've got to get out of there
as fast as they possibly can.

390
00:20:59,749 --> 00:21:03,989
One blast for friends, two for foes.

391
00:21:05,229 --> 00:21:07,909
And three for White Walkers.

392
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:10,149
The threat of winter
coming is very much

393
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,509
a myth to the people of the south.

394
00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:14,549
They're not
really taking it seriously.

395
00:21:14,669 --> 00:21:16,589
They don't know about the undead

396
00:21:16,749 --> 00:21:19,709
and all the horrors
that are coming towards them.

397
00:21:19,829 --> 00:21:22,869
(HORN BLOWS THREE TIMES)

398
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:25,629
Three blasts.
Come on!

399
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:27,749
So what we learn
in season two is that

400
00:21:27,909 --> 00:21:29,949
the White Walkers
are very much real.

401
00:21:30,109 --> 00:21:33,189
They're nothing like we've
ever seen before in television.

402
00:21:33,349 --> 00:21:35,549
They're not just zombies,
they're not just statues,

403
00:21:35,709 --> 00:21:38,149
they're walking
ice cubes, basically.

404
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:41,029
Um, they're, they're really
bad and they're really scary

405
00:21:41,189 --> 00:21:44,709
and it's literally... I think it's
got to be a fight of ice and fire.

406
00:21:44,829 --> 00:21:46,749
(SCREECHES)

407
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:53,789
We have all these kingdoms
wanting to fight for the throne

408
00:21:53,949 --> 00:21:58,229
and they think that that is what
ultimately the battle is about.

409
00:21:58,349 --> 00:22:00,549
But really, at the end of the day,

410
00:22:00,709 --> 00:22:03,869
they're not looking at
what's the real problem here

411
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,909
and it's the White Walkers.

412
00:22:08,669 --> 00:22:11,669
And it's in season two,
in King's Landing,

413
00:22:11,829 --> 00:22:14,069
where we see that Tyrion
may just be an asset

414
00:22:14,229 --> 00:22:17,709
to the war when Stannis
launches an attack on the city.

415
00:22:20,069 --> 00:22:21,789
I'll leave you dead.

416
00:22:21,949 --> 00:22:24,149
The battle of Blackwater
was his moment.

417
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:27,789
He was the best person to speak
to the people of King's Landing

418
00:22:27,949 --> 00:22:31,669
and to get them to protect their,
their... their... their city

419
00:22:31,829 --> 00:22:34,389
because he knows
what it's like to fight,

420
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:37,229
he knows what it's like to have
your back up against the wall.

421
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:40,709
We like an underdog.
And when they...

422
00:22:40,869 --> 00:22:44,189
When the underdog manages
to come out on top,

423
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:46,269
it's a cause for celebration.

424
00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:49,789
(BANGING) Those are brave men
knocking at our door.

425
00:22:51,029 --> 00:22:53,909
Let's go kill them!
(CHEERING)

426
00:22:55,669 --> 00:22:59,629
Tyrion manages to get the
troops fired up by giving

427
00:22:59,789 --> 00:23:03,149
a good speech and then
heads out with them to fight

428
00:23:03,309 --> 00:23:05,949
Stannis on the bay.
He doesn't last very long,

429
00:23:06,109 --> 00:23:07,989
he gets knocked out
after a couple of minutes.

430
00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:10,949
Tyrion is upstaged
by his father Tywin,

431
00:23:11,109 --> 00:23:12,989
who arrives with
his own massive army.

432
00:23:13,149 --> 00:23:16,269
He's been bolstered by the Tyrells,
who firmly joined the cause

433
00:23:16,389 --> 00:23:18,589
and they crush the Stannis attack.

434
00:23:18,749 --> 00:23:21,429
Certain people
have luck on their side.

435
00:23:21,589 --> 00:23:24,589
Other people don't.
Possibly Stannis is one of those...

436
00:23:25,949 --> 00:23:31,349
..very, very unlucky characters
who are destined not to achieve

437
00:23:31,509 --> 00:23:33,349
their goals.
Let's fight!

438
00:23:33,469 --> 00:23:35,989
Tywin's pretty lucky.

439
00:23:36,109 --> 00:23:38,269
Fortune tends to smile on him

440
00:23:38,429 --> 00:23:41,189
when it should damn him.
Father.

441
00:23:41,349 --> 00:23:45,589
And yet, against all the odds,
that battle is won.

442
00:23:46,629 --> 00:23:50,549
The battle is over. We have won.

443
00:23:55,949 --> 00:23:59,469
Season three begins,
Daenerys has set sail on a mission.

444
00:23:59,629 --> 00:24:02,749
She and her dragons may have
grown in power and stature

445
00:24:02,909 --> 00:24:05,229
but securing an army
still eludes her.

446
00:24:05,389 --> 00:24:07,709
So she ventures to a place
where she can buy one.

447
00:24:10,709 --> 00:24:14,069
She knows she needs an army,
a powerful army,

448
00:24:14,229 --> 00:24:17,189
if she ever wants to
reclaim the Westerosi throne

449
00:24:17,349 --> 00:24:21,589
and the best bet for that
are the Unsullied. I have dragons.

450
00:24:21,749 --> 00:24:26,869
I'll give you one. She appears to
want to trade the dragon for slaves.

451
00:24:27,029 --> 00:24:29,389
She seems to have made
this daft agreement

452
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,429
to give away her best dragon.

453
00:24:31,549 --> 00:24:33,469
(SCREECHES)

454
00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:36,669
She hands over the dragon.
Next thing you know,

455
00:24:36,829 --> 00:24:38,589
once she has control
of the Unsullied...

456
00:24:38,709 --> 00:24:40,909
(SPEAKS OWN LANGUAGE)

457
00:24:43,069 --> 00:24:44,989
..then it's very easy
to say to the dragon

458
00:24:45,149 --> 00:24:48,469
who still will listen to her
and not to him, 'Burn him.'

459
00:24:48,589 --> 00:24:49,949
Dracarys!

460
00:24:52,749 --> 00:24:53,949
No! No! No!

461
00:24:54,109 --> 00:24:57,229
Because you would take power
if you have the force of a dragon,

462
00:24:57,349 --> 00:24:59,589
they're pretty impressive creatures.

463
00:24:59,749 --> 00:25:02,349
She's been the mother of dragons
and knew she was destined

464
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:05,069
for greatness but now she
really is a queen with an army.

465
00:25:05,229 --> 00:25:08,349
To then see that she
has thousands of people

466
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:14,749
on her team and then you get,
like, this swoop past.

467
00:25:14,909 --> 00:25:18,869
She's got these, like,
fire-breathing mythical creatures

468
00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:21,469
that they're
just gonna tear shit up.

469
00:25:21,629 --> 00:25:24,709
As this young Targaryen
gains followers,

470
00:25:24,869 --> 00:25:27,989
in King's Landing, a young
Tyrell is gaining influence.

471
00:25:28,149 --> 00:25:31,069
Margaery has replaced Sansa
in Joffrey's affections,

472
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:34,429
a reward for her family's
military support at Blackwater.

473
00:25:36,389 --> 00:25:40,469
I imagine it must be so exciting
to squeeze your finger here

474
00:25:40,589 --> 00:25:43,389
and watch something die over there.

475
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:47,029
Margaery is a woman
who's on top of her game,

476
00:25:47,189 --> 00:25:51,029
she's controlling where she's going,
she's a proper feminist icon.

477
00:25:51,189 --> 00:25:54,469
But the Tyrells' ambitions
are not going down well

478
00:25:54,629 --> 00:25:57,949
with Cersei Lannister. Alana
is the matriarch of the family

479
00:25:58,109 --> 00:26:02,029
and she advises her granddaughter on
how best to play the political game,

480
00:26:02,189 --> 00:26:04,669
so that she might
take power in King's Landing.

481
00:26:04,829 --> 00:26:09,429
To make matters worse, her soulmate
Jaime is a prisoner of war.

482
00:26:09,549 --> 00:26:11,389
He is held first by Brienne of Tarth

483
00:26:11,549 --> 00:26:13,989
then both are captured
by a northern faction.

484
00:26:14,149 --> 00:26:16,829
Looks like your woman's
getting the better of you.

485
00:26:16,989 --> 00:26:20,789
This is all bundled up in when Jaime
starts thinking about other people.

486
00:26:20,949 --> 00:26:23,229
You're only making it worse.
Argh!

487
00:26:23,389 --> 00:26:27,869
His efforts to stop Brienne being
raped are the beginning of that.

488
00:26:27,989 --> 00:26:30,429
You know who she is, don't you?

489
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,389
Argh! It's good when those
little bits of goodness

490
00:26:33,549 --> 00:26:35,829
come in those characters
that are so devilish as well.

491
00:26:35,989 --> 00:26:38,069
Just give you
a little light in there.

492
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:40,309
Lord Selwyn would pay
his daughter's weight

493
00:26:40,469 --> 00:26:42,669
in sapphires if
she's returned to him.

494
00:26:42,829 --> 00:26:45,429
It being Game Of Thrones,
it doesn't get him anywhere.

495
00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:49,149
Argh! Argh! Aarrgghh!

496
00:26:49,309 --> 00:26:52,109
Another one of those Game Of Thrones
moments which has so much more

497
00:26:52,269 --> 00:26:55,229
going on in it than just him
losing his hand. He's the greatest

498
00:26:55,389 --> 00:26:58,749
swordsman in Westeros we're told,
so he can't do that any more.

499
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:01,949
He's now made a good friend in
her and he's seen a lot of things

500
00:27:02,109 --> 00:27:07,109
and I'm sure he's questioning what
being a Lannister is about as well.

501
00:27:07,269 --> 00:27:11,269
Yet, without his hand, we see
Jaime Lannister at his most heroic.

502
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:14,349
The heartless knight who pushed
Bran Stark from the tower

503
00:27:14,469 --> 00:27:16,509
finds new honour in season three.

504
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:20,069
He's left, he's left her behind,
he's abandoned her

505
00:27:20,229 --> 00:27:22,589
and he's on his way
to King's Landing

506
00:27:22,749 --> 00:27:27,549
and then his captors mention
what's gonna happen to her.

507
00:27:27,709 --> 00:27:30,749
Not fair? And then he decides
to return and save her.

508
00:27:32,429 --> 00:27:33,589
(ROARS)

509
00:27:34,549 --> 00:27:37,669
And it is in season three that
we witness the fearsome work

510
00:27:37,829 --> 00:27:40,269
of another powerful family,
the Boltons,

511
00:27:40,429 --> 00:27:43,149
who are scheming
to take control of the North.

512
00:27:43,309 --> 00:27:45,749
I think the Boltons want
what everyone else seems to want,

513
00:27:45,869 --> 00:27:48,389
it's power and status.

514
00:27:48,509 --> 00:27:50,629
Kill me!

515
00:27:52,389 --> 00:27:55,869
You're no good to me dead.
We need you.

516
00:27:55,989 --> 00:27:57,869
Ramsay, a bastard son of the family,

517
00:27:58,029 --> 00:28:01,709
enjoys torturing his enemies,
including Theon Greyjoy,

518
00:28:01,869 --> 00:28:05,549
who he took prisoner when sacking
Winterfell after Ned's demise.

519
00:28:05,709 --> 00:28:09,029
Historically, the Boltons have
always been just under the Starks,

520
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:11,229
kind of the Starks have
always been on top of them,

521
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:15,149
so I think they feel
that now is their time to rise.

522
00:28:15,309 --> 00:28:19,229
You don't look like
Theon Greyjoy any more.

523
00:28:19,389 --> 00:28:23,189
It's unbelievable what Ramsay
is capable of doing to people.

524
00:28:23,349 --> 00:28:26,029
Freak!
He's just all about the mind.

525
00:28:26,189 --> 00:28:27,989
He's all about
making you doubt yourself.

526
00:28:28,149 --> 00:28:30,549
He's all about getting in there
and making you insecure

527
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:34,149
and making you feel like
you can't go up against him.

528
00:28:34,309 --> 00:28:37,349
Another hostage at large
in season three is Arya Stark

529
00:28:37,509 --> 00:28:40,509
kidnapped by the Hound.
The disgraced knight

530
00:28:40,669 --> 00:28:43,749
plans to find Arya's family
and trade her for cash.

531
00:28:43,909 --> 00:28:46,909
Remember what happens
to children who run.

532
00:28:47,069 --> 00:28:51,269
One of the great double acts of Game
Of Thrones is the Hound and Arya.

533
00:28:54,029 --> 00:28:56,669
Don't! Don't kill him.

534
00:28:56,829 --> 00:29:01,189
There's something so perversely
magical about that pairing,

535
00:29:01,349 --> 00:29:05,869
sort of warped mentor-protege
relationship that develops. Ugh!

536
00:29:12,749 --> 00:29:16,629
In his desire to claim a ransom,
the Hound heads for the Twins

537
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:20,269
where he knows Arya's mother
and brother, Catelyn and Robb Stark,

538
00:29:20,389 --> 00:29:22,309
are attending a wedding.

539
00:29:22,509 --> 00:29:26,069
The Twins is a strategic river
crossing controlled by the Frey family

540
00:29:26,229 --> 00:29:29,189
and the Starks need them
onside for their war effort.

541
00:29:29,349 --> 00:29:32,789
Walder Frey is a very
bitter nasty old man

542
00:29:32,949 --> 00:29:35,709
who controls a small but
significant area in the kingdom.

543
00:29:35,869 --> 00:29:38,909
I was pledged to marry one
of you and I broke that vow.

544
00:29:39,069 --> 00:29:43,789
If he's been let down by
Robb Stark after this promise,

545
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:48,629
if he shows any kind of forgiveness
or, 'Just let it go.

546
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:51,469
'He didn't want to marry my
daughter, he married someone else.'

547
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:54,749
He would lose face in that world,

548
00:29:54,909 --> 00:29:57,349
it's a vicious world
he's operating in.

549
00:29:57,509 --> 00:30:00,509
The Stark family offer
Robb's uncle to make amends,

550
00:30:00,669 --> 00:30:03,389
they're here for that wedding,
a terrible mistake.

551
00:30:04,509 --> 00:30:08,669
Also at the wedding is Roose,
head of House Bolton.

552
00:30:08,829 --> 00:30:11,989
Traditionally loyal to the Starks
but not for much longer.

553
00:30:13,189 --> 00:30:16,669
Robb's decision not to marry
Walder Frey's daughter,

554
00:30:16,829 --> 00:30:20,029
he knows he's alienating and going
to upset a very powerful house

555
00:30:20,189 --> 00:30:23,749
and a very, very powerful man.
So he changes his allegiance.

556
00:30:26,229 --> 00:30:28,749
Catelyn, in her heart,

557
00:30:28,909 --> 00:30:32,429
knew that you do not break a promise
if you are the king of the North

558
00:30:32,589 --> 00:30:35,269
and you certainly don't break
it to Walder Frey. Your grace...

559
00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:38,989
He's probably laid awake for nights
just planning it and timing it

560
00:30:39,149 --> 00:30:41,349
and working out just how
it's gonna work out.

561
00:30:41,509 --> 00:30:44,429
The moment where Cat
sees that Roose Bolton

562
00:30:44,589 --> 00:30:48,149
is wearing chain mail
is a powerful moment.

563
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:51,389
Why would you wear
chain mail to a wedding?

564
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:54,949
What is the purpose of chain mail?
It's to prevent you getting killed.

565
00:30:56,469 --> 00:30:58,189
Robb!

566
00:30:58,309 --> 00:31:01,069
Catelyn and Robb and his wife

567
00:31:01,229 --> 00:31:03,869
and all the others,
nobody saw it coming.

568
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:06,829
The Red Wedding is the event
that pretty much decimates

569
00:31:06,989 --> 00:31:09,069
an entire generation
of the Stark family.

570
00:31:10,029 --> 00:31:12,829
Within the Game Of Thrones,
Walder Frey's not playing

571
00:31:12,989 --> 00:31:15,549
the Game Of Thrones.
He's not attempting to be the king.

572
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:18,029
He's actually perfectly
happy with what he's got.

573
00:31:18,149 --> 00:31:20,189
He has his own little fiefdom

574
00:31:20,349 --> 00:31:23,109
and he's sitting in the chair
watching terrible things.

575
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:25,149
Robb is such an amazing character,
I think

576
00:31:25,309 --> 00:31:28,549
you kind of want
him to be the king...

577
00:31:28,709 --> 00:31:30,829
Mother...
..and to win.

578
00:31:32,069 --> 00:31:34,189
The Lannisters send their regards.

579
00:31:35,149 --> 00:31:38,709
It's brutal. 'I'm going to let you know
this information just before I kill you.'

580
00:31:41,869 --> 00:31:46,229
It's another illustration of what
Tywin Lannister is prepared to do.

581
00:31:48,709 --> 00:31:50,749
Aarrgghh!

582
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:54,989
And in that case, he's got somebody
else to do his dirty work.

583
00:31:56,829 --> 00:32:00,349
It's the cruelty of it
and it's the relishing of it.

584
00:32:02,189 --> 00:32:06,269
Everything goes to hell
at the Red Wedding. (CHANTING)

585
00:32:06,429 --> 00:32:09,109
Arya Stark arrives
at the Twins to witness

586
00:32:09,269 --> 00:32:13,829
her brother's desecrated body and
loses any last shred of innocence.

587
00:32:13,989 --> 00:32:15,709
She's there.
She's at the Red Wedding,

588
00:32:15,869 --> 00:32:19,349
she's outside and
she was so close, you know,

589
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:22,149
she was so close to seeing
them again, she was so close.

590
00:32:22,349 --> 00:32:25,989
The path that she goes on,
she learns to become stronger

591
00:32:26,149 --> 00:32:29,749
and fight and also
she was after revenge.

592
00:32:29,909 --> 00:32:32,829
And when she comes across
her family's killers later...

593
00:32:32,989 --> 00:32:35,309
You little shit
..she matches their brutality.

594
00:32:38,029 --> 00:32:41,629
She's had to go over
to the dark side,

595
00:32:41,749 --> 00:32:43,669
that's what makes her interesting.

596
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:47,789
In order to survive in that world,
you have to match what is given you.

597
00:32:47,909 --> 00:32:50,309
And so, by the end of season three,

598
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:53,509
all the elder Starks have
gone from the Game Of Thrones.

599
00:32:53,669 --> 00:32:57,589
Only the children remain, orphaned
and scattered across Westeros,

600
00:32:57,749 --> 00:33:00,869
including Bran Stark,
still paralysed from his fall.

601
00:33:01,029 --> 00:33:04,549
He's fled Winterfell with a loyal
band of followers heading north.

602
00:33:04,709 --> 00:33:07,989
So, Hodor we know as
a very loyal character.

603
00:33:08,149 --> 00:33:11,069
All right, Hodor?
Hodor.

604
00:33:11,229 --> 00:33:14,349
He lost the use of his legs and
Hodor's the person that carries him

605
00:33:14,469 --> 00:33:16,389
around and takes him everywhere,

606
00:33:16,549 --> 00:33:18,669
um, being the big giant
of a man that he is.

607
00:33:20,789 --> 00:33:24,069
It's all right,
the wolves will protect him.

608
00:33:24,229 --> 00:33:27,749
Him and his brother Rickon
are the two last male heirs

609
00:33:27,869 --> 00:33:29,829
to the Stark household.

610
00:33:29,989 --> 00:33:35,589
Um, and, yeah, it's fast depleting,
we're running out of Starks.

611
00:33:35,749 --> 00:33:38,669
I think it's all about Rickon and
Bran kind of sticking together

612
00:33:38,829 --> 00:33:43,389
and, you know, seeing how their
adventures and journeys play out

613
00:33:43,509 --> 00:33:46,549
to kind of find this lost happiness

614
00:33:46,709 --> 00:33:48,789
and this lost family
that they're searching for.

615
00:33:48,949 --> 00:33:52,309
Bran Stark is very much
on his own journey to discover

616
00:33:52,469 --> 00:33:55,269
the roots of this ancient
magic that's reappearing

617
00:33:55,429 --> 00:33:57,589
in the kingdom
throughout the season.

618
00:33:57,749 --> 00:34:00,669
And yet, amid this loss,
comes a small victory.

619
00:34:00,829 --> 00:34:05,509
Unlikely hero Samwell Tarly stumbles
on a weakness of the White Walkers.

620
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:08,429
Samwell reaches for
all he has to hand,

621
00:34:08,589 --> 00:34:11,829
an old dragonglass spear
he once found in the ground.

622
00:34:11,949 --> 00:34:13,909
Ugh! (SCREECHES)

623
00:34:14,029 --> 00:34:16,989
To his astonishment it... it works.

624
00:34:17,829 --> 00:34:21,269
The spells are shattered
and it's melting before him.

625
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:27,909
And stay with us to see wedded bliss
vanish after the break. He's choking!

626
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:31,280
Welcome to Westeros where
the fight for the kingdom is on.

627
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,520
Welcome back to Game Of Thrones,
The Story So Far.

628
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,240
We're in season four,
a royal wedding in King's Landing

629
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:44,000
unites two great houses of Westeros,

630
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,280
the Tyrells and the Lannisters.

631
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,040
Season four begins
with the wedding between

632
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:52,120
King Joffrey and Margaery Tyrell,

633
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,040
And as we know from
experience in Westeros,

634
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,120
weddings are not happy occasions.

635
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,000
It's full of injured parties
with scores to settle.

636
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,120
Chief among them is Oberyn Martell
and his lover Ellaria Sand.

637
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:07,040
In that first meeting
with Cersei and Tywin...

638
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,800
Ellaria Sand.
My lord, my lady.

639
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,280
..they see Ellaria
as being sort of scum.

640
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,960
Ha! I can't say
I've ever met a Sand before.

641
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:21,680
Oberyn has a zest for life and all
the beautiful things that the world

642
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,560
has to offer.
None of it is as beautiful

643
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,360
as his own rage
and taste for revenge.

644
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,200
Oberyn is seeking vengeance
for his sister's brutal death

645
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,800
at the hands of the Lannisters.

646
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:35,840
The rape and murder of women and
children is considered distasteful.

647
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:41,920
Oberyn has a massive grudge
against the Lannisters

648
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:46,400
and he's sort of coming to
the wedding to just sniff out

649
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,920
what's going on and to get justice.

650
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,320
There's been too much amusement...

651
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,600
Joffrey really uses
the wedding as an excuse

652
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,640
to be as horrible as he can.

653
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,680
Uncle, you can be my cup bearer.

654
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:04,120
And the way he treats Tyrion
and everybody at that table,

655
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,160
he's just hideous.

656
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,040
You're watching him
being a total arse.

657
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,640
And so when an unseen hand
poisons the newly wed king...

658
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,920
Idiots! Help your king!
Move away!

659
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:22,880
..it's the moment of retribution the whole
of the Seven Kingdoms have been waiting for.

660
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,120
I think everybody
who watches Game Of Thrones

661
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,480
was hoping this day would come.

662
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,480
Ugh!

663
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,800
I wanted to kill him
in such a way that the viewers

664
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,600
were reminded that here's
a 13-year-old boy who's dying.

665
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,800
Though it is actually the Tyrells
that have poisoned Joffrey,

666
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,840
it is Tyrion who is blamed.

667
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,920
This is really the point
where Tyrion's fragile bonds

668
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,960
with his family begin to unravel.

669
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,200
Take him! Take him!

670
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,320
Take him!

671
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,880
In plot terms, the death of Joffrey
is another shaking of the board

672
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,920
where the pieces are scattered.

673
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,600
And also it's one of those things
that elevate the whole series

674
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,960
from merely a story into a saga.

675
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:12,160
As the royal family grows weaker,
news from Westeros

676
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:15,120
reaches Meereen where Daenerys
has conquered the city

677
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,760
but she is not yet ready to
capitalise on her enemy's weakness.

678
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,040
King Joffrey Baratheon is dead.

679
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,600
Murdered at his own wedding.

680
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,920
This would appear
to be a really good time

681
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,520
for her to finally make
her play for the Iron Throne.

682
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,480
She has the dragons
and she has the army

683
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,400
and she has the
strength of character.

684
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,520
But actually she has
new responsibilities now

685
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,560
and she has unfinished
business where she is

686
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,440
and she's still trying
to learn how to rule.

687
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,600
And to compound matters,
her dragons have grown so big

688
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,520
that Daenerys has started
to lose control of them.

689
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,800
(SNARLS)
Ugh!

690
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:54,600
They get bigger as her power increases,
the harder it is for her to manage.

691
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,440
And that's where the
story then has to go.

692
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,720
All they're going to
bring is complexity.

693
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,080
And when one of the dragons
kills a child and abandons her,

694
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,560
Daenerys is left with no other
choice but to chain the other two.

695
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,920
She's just locked up her dragons,
so can she unleash them again

696
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,960
and will they forgive her?

697
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,080
Without the mighty
force of her dragons,

698
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,720
Daenerys is faced with a dilemma
as to what to do next.

699
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,160
(THEY SCREECH)

700
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,080
She's definitely going through a
sort of a dark night of the soul,

701
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:29,720
I think, where she's trying to
determine, have I got what it takes?

702
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,080
And so, in season four,

703
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,480
as Daenerys remains in exile
across the Narrow Sea,

704
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:39,680
Sansa Stark has fled the capital
and taken refuge with her aunt Lysa,

705
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,360
who has been seduced
by an arch schemer.

706
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:49,720
Littlefinger is playing a very
chaotic game and he thrives on that.

707
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,640
Oh, my sweet wife.

708
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:56,680
For Littlefinger, it's all
about getting power, I think,

709
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,280
and using Lysa
as a pawn along the way.

710
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,400
Argh!

711
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,880
Sansa has witnessed Lysa's murder

712
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,920
and covers for Littlefinger.

713
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,600
Sansa's one of these
poor characters who's been

714
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,920
mistreated all through the series.

715
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,120
She's seen a lot of horrible,
horrible things happen

716
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,720
and she's never been able to take
control and this is the first time.

717
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,000
Actually, she's got
nothing else to lose.

718
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,480
He tried to reason with her,
promised her

719
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,880
she was the only woman
he'd ever loved.

720
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:31,480
But she stepped
through those doors...

721
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,320
What you discover is that she's
been learning this entire time.

722
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,440
She's been listening,
she's been watching.

723
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:45,400
She's been taking
Littlefinger's lessons to heart.

724
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,920
So, from one Stark
protege to another.

725
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,800
Sansa's sister Arya
is still the Hound's hostage

726
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,400
but they're now on an equal footing.

727
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,640
Who would pass the Bloody Gate?

728
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:00,400
The bloody Hound, Sandor Clegane.

729
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,640
He's her captor
but he's also her protector

730
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,920
and, you know, she's seen his own
pain and his own fear at times

731
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,680
and they've shared
some dangerous situations.

732
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,320
But when the Hound
is gravely injured in battle,

733
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,800
Arya is forced to
strike out on her own.

734
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,840
Fuck it! I'm ready.

735
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,280
Now he's wounded and he's dying
and she's remembering

736
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,960
all he said about mercy
and he's asking for mercy

737
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:30,120
and by mercy he means, you know,
a quick thrust to kill him.

738
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,280
And she doesn't give it to him.

739
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,960
Kill me.

740
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,200
She won't put him out of his misery,

741
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,440
she won't give him the easy way out,

742
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,640
she's going to leave
him there to suffer.

743
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,280
Another wandering Stark is
Arya's crippled brother Bran,

744
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:51,160
who has made it north of the Wall
in search of a Three-Eyed Raven

745
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,200
who he believes
will help him walk again.

746
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,640
All the time, aided by his
loyal travelling companion Hodor.

747
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:00,120
I think Hodor's more
than just Bran's legs.

748
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:04,800
I mean, I think he means a lot
to Bran, you know, someone to...

749
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,040
He's always been there through
absolutely everything, you know.

750
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,360
Even though he can't speak,
he can only say one word,

751
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,480
he's always someone
that's looking after him.

752
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,880
You know, in a world of evil, he's
probably one of the only good ones.

753
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,560
Clearly, Bran
is very important because

754
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,840
he's trekked all the way up north
to a cave where this raven

755
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,440
has been summoning him
for the past couple of seasons

756
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,880
and now he's in this cave
with the Three-Eyed Raven,

757
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:33,480
we're gonna find out what the grand
scheme of things is for Bran.

758
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:35,640
You'll never walk again.

759
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,200
But you will fly.

760
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:43,600
His powers, he's getting stronger

761
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,720
and there's gonna be some really
exciting things happening, I think.

762
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,760
We're gonna find out
more and more about him.

763
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,880
At the Wall, the Night's Watch
suffers a huge Wildling attack

764
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:57,480
at Castle Black but in season four
they get a powerful new ally.

765
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,080
Stannis Baratheon, who's
been away licking his wounds

766
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:04,240
after the Blackwater defeat
joins them with his vast army.

767
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,560
The Battle of the Blackwater
was a huge and crushing defeat

768
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:12,400
at the end of season two and it's
taken them basically two seasons

769
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:15,960
to sort of rebuild from that.
And his arrival means that Jon Snow

770
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,520
could have a new ally in the
battle against the White Walkers

771
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,120
beyond the Wall. If my father had
seen the things that I've seen,

772
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:26,320
he'd also tell you to burn
the dead before nightfall.

773
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,000
All of them.

774
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:32,440
Season four draws to
a mighty climax in King's Landing

775
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,720
when the ultimate father-and-son
showdown comes to a head.

776
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,760
Tyrion is tried for murder.

777
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,920
I'm guilty of being a dwarf.

778
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:46,760
You're not on trial for being
a dwarf. Oh, yes, I am.

779
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,600
I've been on trial
for that my entire life.

780
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:54,120
Finally, Tyrion just says,
'You know what this is about.

781
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,160
'It's because I'm a dwarf.'

782
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,200
You know.

783
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:03,440
And he's absolutely right,
that is what it's about.

784
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,000
He's put on trial for
a murder he doesn't commit.

785
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,120
His father deserts him
and betrays him.

786
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,480
I demand a trial by combat!

787
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,640
I mean, trial by combat, you can get
someone to fight for your honour,

788
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,480
so whether you're wrong or not,

789
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,480
as long as they win the fight,
that's what matters.

790
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,400
He names Oberyn Martell
as his champion.

791
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,480
You're going to fight that?

792
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,440
I'm going to kill that.

793
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:32,120
I think Ellaria has total faith

794
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:36,040
in the Red Viper,
her lover's powers as a fighter.

795
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:41,200
But the minute she sees
the Mountain, she doubts it.

796
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,840
(THEY GRUNT)

797
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,880
The one thing that he's ever lived
for is to avenge his sister's death

798
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:51,520
and he knows that now that the
opportunity is presenting itself,

799
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,240
there is no question that
he will get what he wants.

800
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,680
You killed my sister!

801
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:05,000
And he does get what he wants by
forcing a confession out of him.

802
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,880
It's not exactly how he expected it.

803
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:11,200
Aarrgghh!
I killed her children.

804
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,160
He still technically
got what he wanted.

805
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,760
Aarrgghh!
Then I raped her. Aarrgghh!

806
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,360
Then I smashed
her head in like this.

807
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,320
Argh!
(SCREAMS)

808
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:27,920
She's lost the man who was her
protector, who was her champion,

809
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:33,320
who was everything that
she believed in in her world.

810
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:35,960
Tyrion Lannister...

811
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:40,320
With his champion defeated, Tyrion's
life now hangs in the balance.

812
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,120
..you are hereby sentenced to death.

813
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:50,000
In Westeros, the pursuit of justice
is as futile as anything else.

814
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,440
Oh, get on with it,
you son of a whore.

815
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,760
Is that any way to
speak about our mother?

816
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,240
Tyrion is released from jail
by his brother Jaime

817
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,600
and told to go and
board a ship and run away.

818
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,720
Instead, he decides
to check in on his father.

819
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:05,880
Mmm!

820
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:10,160
But it's his former lover Shae
that he discovers in Tywin's bed.

821
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,440
Tyrion then kills Shae
in a sort of fit of jealousy

822
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:17,560
and then takes a crossbow
and goes to find his father.

823
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,600
Tyrion.

824
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,960
Put down the crossbow.

825
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,680
Tywin really has
had it coming to him.

826
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,440
Ugh!

827
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:34,160
I don't know how much more Tywin
could have got away with, really.

828
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,960
Especially after what
he's put Tyrion through.

829
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:40,960
You're no son of mine.
I am your son.

830
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:46,000
This is someone who spent his whole
life trying to win his approbation,

831
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:50,040
as much as he hated him, he
really wanted that, you know.

832
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,880
Obviously that's
never gonna happen now

833
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,760
because he put a crossbow
bolt in his groin. (LAUGHS)

834
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:59,080
Ugh! What it means, is when
a big character like that goes,

835
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:02,800
there's gonna be a power vacuum
and there's gonna be hustling

836
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:04,840
and jostling to get into his place.

837
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,000
I am the queen!
I am the queen! I'm not...

838
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:12,000
Join us after the break where,
in season five,

839
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:14,840
a new power rises in King's Landing.

840
00:46:20,085 --> 00:46:20,245
Welcome to Westeros where
the fight for the kingdom is on.

841
00:46:23,365 --> 00:46:27,165
Welcome back to The Story So Far.
Where, in season five,

842
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:29,685
a royal wedding unsettles Cersei.

843
00:46:30,765 --> 00:46:33,965
Her son Tommen is now king
and has fallen under the spell

844
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:37,445
of his new queen Margaery,
much to Cersei's dismay.

845
00:46:37,565 --> 00:46:39,485
When Margaery come in his life,

846
00:46:39,685 --> 00:46:42,525
I think he was just
enjoying life so much.

847
00:46:42,685 --> 00:46:45,725
Judging from the king's enthusiasm,
the Queen Mother

848
00:46:45,885 --> 00:46:48,765
will be a queen grandmother soon.
Wouldn't that be a lovely day?

849
00:46:48,925 --> 00:46:51,765
Him being king was just a whole
new excitement, a whole new life.

850
00:46:52,525 --> 00:46:55,125
Cersei empowers religious fanatics

851
00:46:55,285 --> 00:46:57,605
to help her topple her rival,
Queen Margaery.

852
00:46:57,765 --> 00:47:00,045
I can't hear it.
I am the queen!

853
00:47:00,205 --> 00:47:02,205
Cersei brings back
the Faith Militant

854
00:47:02,365 --> 00:47:05,325
because, in her mind, this is
her wiping the slate clean,

855
00:47:05,485 --> 00:47:09,605
this is her taking an opportunity
to claw back a little bit of power.

856
00:47:09,765 --> 00:47:13,045
But Cersei's engineered
her own downfall.

857
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:16,885
Royalty is no longer above the law
and fanatics come for her next.

858
00:47:19,685 --> 00:47:23,725
It's hard to see how anybody would
be able to get the power back

859
00:47:23,885 --> 00:47:26,885
from the High Sparrow
and Septa Unella.

860
00:47:27,045 --> 00:47:31,085
Move. There's another
contender to power in Westeros

861
00:47:31,245 --> 00:47:33,645
and it's religion.
It's the power of the faith.

862
00:47:33,805 --> 00:47:38,205
They want to remove
all the excesses.

863
00:47:38,325 --> 00:47:42,005
To strip Cersei of all her finery

864
00:47:42,165 --> 00:47:46,245
and encourage her, in inverted
commas, to become clean.

865
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:49,445
It's such a sexualised
form of humiliation.

866
00:47:49,565 --> 00:47:51,365
A sinner comes before you.

867
00:47:51,525 --> 00:47:54,405
Watching Cersei
do the walk of atonement,

868
00:47:54,565 --> 00:47:57,245
something happened that
I thought would never happen

869
00:47:57,365 --> 00:47:59,325
and that is I felt compassion.

870
00:47:59,485 --> 00:48:03,525
No matter what she'd done
previously, she didn't deserve this.

871
00:48:03,685 --> 00:48:08,245
And so season five sees her
left naked before her subjects

872
00:48:08,405 --> 00:48:12,085
to atone for her infidelities.
(SHOUTING)

873
00:48:12,245 --> 00:48:14,645
Who would've thought we
would've felt sorry for Cersei

874
00:48:14,805 --> 00:48:17,685
until the walk of shame?
It was very, very tough for her.

875
00:48:17,845 --> 00:48:20,845
Very few women could have done
what she did, complete that walk.

876
00:48:21,005 --> 00:48:25,405
People love to hate her,
so you see her

877
00:48:25,565 --> 00:48:29,325
trying to maintain
this regal presence

878
00:48:29,445 --> 00:48:31,285
but she can't.

879
00:48:31,445 --> 00:48:34,725
Stripped down to her, literally,
physically and emotionally

880
00:48:34,885 --> 00:48:37,405
and psychologically, stripped
down to her most vulnerable

881
00:48:37,565 --> 00:48:40,645
and then swept up into the
arms of the beast that she...

882
00:48:40,765 --> 00:48:43,125
that she invited into the world.

883
00:48:43,285 --> 00:48:47,085
The strange creation
that is her new knight.

884
00:48:47,205 --> 00:48:49,565
It's just a brilliant twist.

885
00:48:49,725 --> 00:48:51,605
When Cersei's picked up
by the Mountain

886
00:48:51,765 --> 00:48:55,325
and Qyburn tells her
what's happened,

887
00:48:55,485 --> 00:48:57,965
the brilliant look
across Cersei's eyes

888
00:48:58,125 --> 00:49:02,485
of, 'Whatever happens,
I will get these people.'

889
00:49:04,365 --> 00:49:07,805
Also getting a new ally
in season five is Daenerys,

890
00:49:07,965 --> 00:49:10,685
in the form of Tyrion.
After killing his father,

891
00:49:10,845 --> 00:49:14,885
he's fled across the Narrow Sea,
a fugitive on the run.

892
00:49:15,045 --> 00:49:19,085
He was a Lannister and he
had all the money in the world

893
00:49:19,245 --> 00:49:23,485
and a noble name
and a big bag of gold

894
00:49:23,645 --> 00:49:26,205
can buy you a lot.
All that's gone now.

895
00:49:26,365 --> 00:49:29,885
He's totally at the mercy
of the people he's travelling with.

896
00:49:30,045 --> 00:49:33,605
Who are you? And then the
unthinkable happens. I am the gift.

897
00:49:33,765 --> 00:49:37,045
He's captured and handed over
to his family's greatest enemy,

898
00:49:37,205 --> 00:49:39,725
the Targaryen
queen in waiting, Daenerys.

899
00:49:39,845 --> 00:49:42,165
My name is Tyrion Lannister.

900
00:49:43,125 --> 00:49:47,525
And between them,
they are an extraordinary force.

901
00:49:47,685 --> 00:49:51,325
Protect your queen! She appoints
him as her political adviser.

902
00:49:51,485 --> 00:49:55,245
But when a civil rebellion begins,
Tyrion gets to witness Daenerys

903
00:49:55,365 --> 00:49:58,445
transform into a true Targaryen.

904
00:49:58,605 --> 00:50:02,845
The symbol of the Targaryens
coming to claim their power

905
00:50:03,005 --> 00:50:06,645
is on the back of a dragon because,
I mean, there's not much you can do

906
00:50:06,805 --> 00:50:10,245
when you're standing on the ground
and a dragon's coming at you.

907
00:50:11,405 --> 00:50:13,605
(SCREAMING)

908
00:50:15,205 --> 00:50:17,725
Daenerys has had the dragons
now for quite some time now

909
00:50:17,885 --> 00:50:22,525
but that moment she gets on Drogon
and rides him for the first time,

910
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:24,565
that is her claiming her birthright.

911
00:50:25,725 --> 00:50:28,725
The dragon riders are what
the Targaryens are all about.

912
00:50:28,885 --> 00:50:30,765
That is how they
wielded their power.

913
00:50:30,925 --> 00:50:35,165
(SPEAKS OWN LANGUAGE) Everybody
painted that picture of Daenerys

914
00:50:35,325 --> 00:50:37,485
flying her dragon,
it never really happened.

915
00:50:37,645 --> 00:50:40,805
And they've waited so many years
to see that and she finally does

916
00:50:40,965 --> 00:50:44,285
and she does it in a wicked way
where she's escaping death.

917
00:50:46,045 --> 00:50:48,765
Daenerys, she's got
the greatest name ever.

918
00:50:48,885 --> 00:50:51,405
Stormborn, Mother of Dragons.

919
00:50:51,565 --> 00:50:54,645
Daenerys Stormborn Targaryen,
I love that name.

920
00:50:54,805 --> 00:50:58,205
She's got these dragons as back-up
and then she's got Tyrion,

921
00:50:58,325 --> 00:51:00,405
who knows King's Landing,

922
00:51:00,565 --> 00:51:02,925
who knows the political
side of things

923
00:51:03,085 --> 00:51:04,965
and he's been
through battles as well.

924
00:51:05,085 --> 00:51:07,205
Yet, as season five ends,

925
00:51:07,365 --> 00:51:10,965
Daenerys's dragon delivers
her to an uncertain fate.

926
00:51:12,485 --> 00:51:14,285
The last thing we see
of her in season five,

927
00:51:14,445 --> 00:51:16,485
surrounded by Dothraki,
back where she started.

928
00:51:16,605 --> 00:51:18,245
(SHOUTING)

929
00:51:21,285 --> 00:51:24,525
And season five is one
of vengeance for Arya.

930
00:51:24,685 --> 00:51:28,645
The young Stark follows her mentor
to Braavos to become an assassin.

931
00:51:28,805 --> 00:51:32,525
To serve well,
a girl must become no-one.

932
00:51:32,685 --> 00:51:36,325
Arya's relationship
with Jaqen is fascinating.

933
00:51:36,445 --> 00:51:39,005
He is utterly mysterious

934
00:51:39,125 --> 00:51:44,645
and she is seduced by his power.

935
00:51:44,765 --> 00:51:47,285
I didn't come here to sweep floors.

936
00:51:47,405 --> 00:51:50,525
No? Why come then?

937
00:51:50,645 --> 00:51:52,925
You said I could be your apprentice.

938
00:51:53,085 --> 00:51:56,205
The power of death,
the power to choose who dies.

939
00:51:56,365 --> 00:51:59,645
And Arya uses her new skills
to slaughter Meryn Trant,

940
00:51:59,805 --> 00:52:02,605
a name on her kill list of people
who have destroyed her world.

941
00:52:02,765 --> 00:52:05,445
Argh!
Arya's just a wee assassin.

942
00:52:05,565 --> 00:52:07,485
Argh! Argh!

943
00:52:07,645 --> 00:52:12,285
She made him suffer
in the best way possible

944
00:52:12,405 --> 00:52:14,405
and she thoroughly enjoyed it.

945
00:52:14,565 --> 00:52:18,085
But you must remember
what Arya has been through. Argh!

946
00:52:18,245 --> 00:52:23,045
There is a sense of vengeance
rather than a sense of justice.

947
00:52:23,165 --> 00:52:25,485
As Arya explores vengeance,

948
00:52:25,645 --> 00:52:28,965
back home, the battle is on
for the Stark family home.

949
00:52:29,125 --> 00:52:31,405
Stannis Baratheon
is marching on Winterfell,

950
00:52:31,525 --> 00:52:33,445
now held by the Boltons.

951
00:52:34,605 --> 00:52:37,725
But sometimes sacrifices
must be made to ensure victory.

952
00:52:37,885 --> 00:52:43,565
He's going after something and it
is... it's increasingly futile.

953
00:52:43,725 --> 00:52:46,245
In a desperate move,
Stannis follows the advice

954
00:52:46,405 --> 00:52:48,645
of a red priestess
who promises him victory

955
00:52:48,805 --> 00:52:52,045
if he makes an unspeakable
offering to the Lord of Light.

956
00:52:52,205 --> 00:52:54,925
She managed to convince him
to burn his own daughter.

957
00:52:55,085 --> 00:52:57,965
That's one of the most chilling
scenes, I think, of season five,

958
00:52:58,085 --> 00:53:01,525
when... when he burns his child.

959
00:53:01,685 --> 00:53:05,365
She's believed in this god
for so many years, I think that

960
00:53:05,525 --> 00:53:08,525
if it's not to do with the god, she
kind of just blocks everything out

961
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:11,165
and I think that's what happened
as she blocked out the fact

962
00:53:11,325 --> 00:53:13,445
that she was going
to be sacrificing a child.

963
00:53:13,605 --> 00:53:15,485
She was sacrificing
the king's blood.

964
00:53:15,605 --> 00:53:16,725
(SCREAMING)

965
00:53:16,885 --> 00:53:20,445
Melisandre really did believe that
Stannis was going to be the one

966
00:53:20,605 --> 00:53:24,045
who would bring everything together
and he was going to be the ruler

967
00:53:24,205 --> 00:53:26,765
of the Seven Kingdoms and she
put a lot of her heart and soul

968
00:53:26,925 --> 00:53:30,565
into helping him.
But it proves to be his undoing.

969
00:53:30,725 --> 00:53:33,925
His men desert him and Melisandre,
realising all is lost,

970
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:36,485
flees to Castle Black...
We're ready.

971
00:53:36,645 --> 00:53:39,005
..leaving Stannis to advance
to Winterfell on his own.

972
00:53:39,165 --> 00:53:41,845
Speak up.
It can't be worse than mutiny.

973
00:53:42,005 --> 00:53:43,885
He's had a rough old time,
Stannis, hasn't he?

974
00:53:44,045 --> 00:53:47,485
Because really he should be the king
from after Robert Baratheon dies

975
00:53:47,645 --> 00:53:51,485
but every battle, he loses he
becomes further and further

976
00:53:51,605 --> 00:53:53,885
involved with this kind of fantasy.

977
00:53:54,045 --> 00:53:57,365
And awaiting Stannis
at Winterfell are the Boltons,

978
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:59,605
who tried to cement
their position in the North

979
00:53:59,765 --> 00:54:01,645
with a tactical marriage
to Sansa Stark,

980
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:05,045
orchestrated by master
manipulator Petyr Baelish.

981
00:54:05,205 --> 00:54:07,325
She shouldn't trust Littlefinger,
I mean,

982
00:54:07,485 --> 00:54:10,125
why are you gonna trust
Littlefinger, I mean, jeez!

983
00:54:10,285 --> 00:54:13,605
He is the dodgy car
salesman in Game Of Thrones,

984
00:54:13,765 --> 00:54:16,805
offers you everything
and gives you nothing.

985
00:54:16,965 --> 00:54:20,565
May I introduce my son,
Ramsay Bolton.

986
00:54:21,885 --> 00:54:24,845
Now the Boltons have established
themselves at Winterfell,

987
00:54:25,005 --> 00:54:29,485
bringing in a Stark will solidify
their position in the North.

988
00:54:29,605 --> 00:54:31,525
But it's a huge miscalculation

989
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:34,285
that traps her in another
brutal relationship.

990
00:54:34,445 --> 00:54:39,565
Ramsay is a horrible, cruel,
evil, power-hungry man.

991
00:54:39,725 --> 00:54:43,325
He took psychotic nature
to another level.

992
00:54:43,485 --> 00:54:45,485
I mean, he went there,
and he went some.

993
00:54:45,605 --> 00:54:47,365
Oh, no, no, no.

994
00:54:47,485 --> 00:54:50,325
You stay here, Reek.

995
00:54:50,485 --> 00:54:52,365
You watch.

996
00:54:52,525 --> 00:54:57,245
Fellow prisoner Theon Greyjoy,
aka Reek, is too terrified to help.

997
00:54:57,445 --> 00:55:01,165
I think we all thought he should have stepped
in on the wedding night, let's be frank.

998
00:55:01,325 --> 00:55:04,125
With Ramsay distracted by battle...
You're leaving it to me?

999
00:55:04,285 --> 00:55:06,205
..Sansa is caught
attempting to escape

1000
00:55:06,365 --> 00:55:10,005
and it's only then that Reek finds
the courage to become Theon again.

1001
00:55:10,925 --> 00:55:14,965
Ugh!
Stop! (SCREAMS) Ugh!

1002
00:55:15,125 --> 00:55:17,245
That was a moment we all
needed to see. Theon again

1003
00:55:17,405 --> 00:55:20,005
had been so much
at the mercy of Ramsey

1004
00:55:20,165 --> 00:55:23,885
that finally he had a moment
where he could do good.

1005
00:55:24,005 --> 00:55:26,365
And so, by the end of season five,

1006
00:55:26,525 --> 00:55:29,805
Sansa has jumped either to
her death or to her freedom.

1007
00:55:31,365 --> 00:55:36,885
It's someone being
pushed in every way

1008
00:55:37,045 --> 00:55:40,805
to the absolute limit
of their will to live

1009
00:55:40,925 --> 00:55:45,125
and having come through that,

1010
00:55:45,285 --> 00:55:49,045
she's obviously gonna be
quite a different person.

1011
00:55:49,205 --> 00:55:53,445
As Sansa and Theon leap
from the walls of Winterfell,

1012
00:55:53,605 --> 00:55:57,525
nearby, Stannis is facing
defeat by the vast Bolton army.

1013
00:55:59,885 --> 00:56:02,005
I think Stannis had given up.
I think even before

1014
00:56:02,165 --> 00:56:04,685
they'd gone into battle,
I think he was going there to die.

1015
00:56:04,845 --> 00:56:08,365
Fate finally catches up with Stannis
when he comes face to face

1016
00:56:08,525 --> 00:56:10,605
with Brienne of Tarth
who's sought vengeance

1017
00:56:10,725 --> 00:56:13,125
for Renly's death since season two.

1018
00:56:13,285 --> 00:56:19,245
She is probably the toughest person
going about... about Westeros.

1019
00:56:27,485 --> 00:56:28,765
Argh!

1020
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:30,805
But as Stannis bows out,

1021
00:56:30,965 --> 00:56:34,725
Jon Snow comes up against a greater
foe when he ventures to Hardhome

1022
00:56:34,845 --> 00:56:36,845
to make peace with the Wildlings.

1023
00:56:37,005 --> 00:56:39,805
This alliance is sacrilege
but when the White Walkers

1024
00:56:39,965 --> 00:56:42,965
launch a full attack,
Jon sees his hunch is right.

1025
00:56:43,125 --> 00:56:46,725
All humans must unite to fight them.
(GROWLS)

1026
00:56:46,885 --> 00:56:49,205
What's so great about the
whole White Walker mythology

1027
00:56:49,365 --> 00:56:51,845
is the way it has been building
throughout the series.

1028
00:56:51,965 --> 00:56:54,285
Who knows what they want?

1029
00:56:54,445 --> 00:56:56,325
They would bring
death and destruction

1030
00:56:56,445 --> 00:56:59,045
to absolutely everything.

1031
00:57:02,245 --> 00:57:05,205
Up until this point, they've
been semi-mythical characters.

1032
00:57:05,365 --> 00:57:07,525
It's been the White Walkers
in those cold lands

1033
00:57:07,645 --> 00:57:09,565
that no-one ever goes to

1034
00:57:09,725 --> 00:57:13,485
and here they are in front of the
heroes and they're very real

1035
00:57:13,605 --> 00:57:15,805
and it's a very real danger.

1036
00:57:17,925 --> 00:57:21,005
I don't think the White Walkers
are afraid of anything.

1037
00:57:21,165 --> 00:57:25,645
I think fear is just
not in their vocabulary.

1038
00:57:27,525 --> 00:57:30,365
And then Jon and the viewers
see the Night King reveal

1039
00:57:30,485 --> 00:57:32,405
that he has a greater power.

1040
00:57:33,445 --> 00:57:36,245
He can raise and recruit the dead.

1041
00:57:38,685 --> 00:57:41,725
It's a challenge to Jon
and, 'Look what I can do.'

1042
00:57:44,885 --> 00:57:47,405
Forget all the other
battles that are going on,

1043
00:57:47,565 --> 00:57:51,205
you know, battles for castles
and kingship, you know.

1044
00:57:51,325 --> 00:57:53,365
He's got to focus his army.

1045
00:57:53,485 --> 00:57:55,765
But on Jon's return to Castle Black,

1046
00:57:55,885 --> 00:57:57,845
in the final minutes of season five,

1047
00:57:58,005 --> 00:58:00,325
viewers witness
the cruellest blow of all

1048
00:58:00,445 --> 00:58:02,365
in a gut-churning finale.

1049
00:58:02,525 --> 00:58:06,685
When I saw the cross with traitor
written on it, I thought, 'Oh, no,

1050
00:58:06,805 --> 00:58:09,005
'they're not gonna kill him.'

1051
00:58:09,125 --> 00:58:11,605
And then they did!

1052
00:58:14,605 --> 00:58:16,525
For the Watch.

1053
00:58:16,685 --> 00:58:19,405
You root for him but the great
thing about Game Of Thrones is

1054
00:58:19,525 --> 00:58:21,445
your heroes can die at any second.

1055
00:58:25,405 --> 00:58:27,645
For the Watch.

1056
00:58:27,805 --> 00:58:29,685
They're all members
of the Night's Watch

1057
00:58:29,845 --> 00:58:32,605
and no matter what
one of their brothers has done,

1058
00:58:32,765 --> 00:58:35,925
what they did was
worse than what he did.

1059
00:58:36,085 --> 00:58:40,245
And so season five
ends on betrayal and death.

1060
00:58:40,365 --> 00:58:42,645
Is this really the end for Jon Snow?

1061
00:58:48,965 --> 00:58:51,925
Season six begins
at the scene of a crime.

1062
00:58:52,045 --> 00:58:55,005
Jon Snow lies slain at Castle Black

1063
00:58:55,165 --> 00:58:57,285
and all hopes are pinned
on the red priestess

1064
00:58:57,405 --> 00:58:59,565
and her magic to bring him back.

1065
00:59:00,725 --> 00:59:02,965
Game Of Thrones needs Jon Snow.

1066
00:59:03,125 --> 00:59:06,885
We do, we need him
to finish what he started.

1067
00:59:07,045 --> 00:59:09,405
As viewers hope
for Jon's resurrection,

1068
00:59:09,565 --> 00:59:13,285
we learn that Melisandre
harbours a great secret.

1069
00:59:13,445 --> 00:59:16,485
The reveal of ancient Melisandre
was definitely one of the most

1070
00:59:16,645 --> 00:59:19,245
stunning surprises in season
six of Game Of Thrones.

1071
00:59:20,525 --> 00:59:22,965
It shows how much
older she actually is

1072
00:59:23,125 --> 00:59:26,405
and how much longer she's been
believing in this god for.

1073
00:59:26,565 --> 00:59:30,325
Then we see her
use this power for Jon.

1074
00:59:30,485 --> 00:59:33,445
She tries to bring him back to us,
to resurrect him, it doesn't work.

1075
00:59:33,605 --> 00:59:36,765
When the wolf started
to sort of make some noise,

1076
00:59:36,925 --> 00:59:40,805
that's when I thought... I think
everyone thought Jon Snow's alive.

1077
00:59:40,965 --> 00:59:43,445
And then it's just that moment of...
(GASPS)

1078
00:59:43,605 --> 00:59:47,725
Jon Snow has returned and all
of Westeros rejoices. (LAUGHS)

1079
00:59:47,885 --> 00:59:50,405
And after the miracle
of Jon's rebirth

1080
00:59:50,565 --> 00:59:53,285
comes a partial reunion
of scattered Starks

1081
00:59:53,405 --> 00:59:55,405
when Sansa arrives at Castle Black

1082
00:59:55,565 --> 00:59:59,165
and together they'll gather forces
in a bid to retake the North.

1083
01:00:03,085 --> 01:00:07,845
Sansa's become majestic
but she's also become savvy.

1084
01:00:07,965 --> 01:00:09,885
She's lost that naivety.

1085
01:00:10,045 --> 01:00:14,445
A monster has taken
our home and our brother.

1086
01:00:15,525 --> 01:00:18,405
We have to go back to
Winterfell and save them both.

1087
01:00:18,525 --> 01:00:20,645
She's a queen, really.

1088
01:00:20,845 --> 01:00:23,525
In terms of being
from a powerful family

1089
01:00:23,685 --> 01:00:26,485
and being able to make decisions
and tell other people to do stuff,

1090
01:00:26,645 --> 01:00:28,725
I think she's gonna tell
other people to do stuff.

1091
01:00:28,885 --> 01:00:32,205
As one former Bolton
captive looks for revenge,

1092
01:00:32,325 --> 01:00:34,245
another looks for redemption.

1093
01:00:34,365 --> 01:00:36,285
I am Theon Greyjoy.

1094
01:00:37,325 --> 01:00:39,525
Last living son of Balon Greyjoy.

1095
01:00:39,685 --> 01:00:42,485
Theon returns again
to the Iron Islands.

1096
01:00:42,645 --> 01:00:45,125
But, following his
father's mysterious death,

1097
01:00:45,245 --> 01:00:47,165
renounces his claim.

1098
01:00:47,325 --> 01:00:51,565
And she is your rightful ruler.
ALL: Aye!

1099
01:00:51,725 --> 01:00:55,805
Theon, by backing Yara,
shows that he's learnt

1100
01:00:55,965 --> 01:01:00,405
from his massive fall
and humiliation and castration

1101
01:01:00,565 --> 01:01:04,565
and he's learnt
who is the more powerful person.

1102
01:01:04,685 --> 01:01:08,885
CHANT: Yara! Yara! Yara! Yara!

1103
01:01:09,005 --> 01:01:10,805
I'm Euron Greyjoy.

1104
01:01:10,925 --> 01:01:13,845
I claim the Salt Throne.

1105
01:01:14,005 --> 01:01:18,405
But it's not all plain sailing
for Yara. Her uncle Euron arrives

1106
01:01:18,565 --> 01:01:21,165
and immediately
scuppers her plan to rule.

1107
01:01:22,285 --> 01:01:25,845
Euron comes in and we know
he's killed the father

1108
01:01:26,005 --> 01:01:30,085
and Yara announces
that he's killed the father

1109
01:01:30,245 --> 01:01:32,125
and you think that's
gonna be the end of him.

1110
01:01:32,285 --> 01:01:34,525
He led us into
two wars we couldn't win.

1111
01:01:34,685 --> 01:01:38,645
I apologise to you all
for not killing him years ago.

1112
01:01:38,805 --> 01:01:43,645
He is just
the most insane creation.

1113
01:01:43,765 --> 01:01:45,885
He's cocky, he's arrogant.

1114
01:01:46,045 --> 01:01:48,285
He could start a fight
in an empty room.

1115
01:01:48,405 --> 01:01:50,445
I wasn't born to be king.

1116
01:01:50,605 --> 01:01:55,085
I paid the iron price
and here I stand.

1117
01:01:55,205 --> 01:01:58,405
(CHEERING) Euron! Euron!

1118
01:01:58,565 --> 01:02:01,125
All the men will still
side with a another man

1119
01:02:01,285 --> 01:02:04,685
because he's shown such
ruthlessness and cunning.

1120
01:02:04,805 --> 01:02:07,205
With Euron crowned king,

1121
01:02:07,365 --> 01:02:10,725
Theon and Yara flee,
taking part of the fleet with them.

1122
01:02:10,845 --> 01:02:13,085
They stole our best ships.

1123
01:02:13,245 --> 01:02:18,485
They are headed across the
Narrow Sea to join Daenerys

1124
01:02:18,605 --> 01:02:21,205
who's been a hostage of the Dothraki.

1125
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:25,685
But now burns their leaders
and converts the tribe.

1126
01:02:27,965 --> 01:02:30,005
The huge Dothraki horde.

1127
01:02:30,165 --> 01:02:33,685
(SPEAKS OWN LANGUAGE)
(THEY SHOUT)

1128
01:02:33,845 --> 01:02:39,845
We're gonna finally get a lot
of different power factions

1129
01:02:40,005 --> 01:02:43,165
coming together
in a very scary explosive way.

1130
01:02:43,285 --> 01:02:46,005
And she bags herself a navy

1131
01:02:46,165 --> 01:02:49,565
by forging an alliance with Yara
who pledges her fleet of ships.

1132
01:02:50,645 --> 01:02:53,685
But as Great Houses unite for war,

1133
01:02:53,845 --> 01:02:56,245
beyond the Wall, we learn
more about the deathly foe

1134
01:02:56,365 --> 01:02:58,285
which threatens them all.

1135
01:02:58,445 --> 01:03:00,965
While time training
with a Three-Eyed Raven,

1136
01:03:01,085 --> 01:03:03,685
Bran Stark uncovers a great secret.

1137
01:03:03,845 --> 01:03:06,445
White Walkers were created
from the First Men.

1138
01:03:09,645 --> 01:03:12,765
The Children Of The Forest
invented the White Walkers

1139
01:03:12,885 --> 01:03:16,485
to help protect their own race.

1140
01:03:16,645 --> 01:03:20,805
It was an innocent
defence to do that.

1141
01:03:20,965 --> 01:03:24,045
But clearly it has
gone out of control.

1142
01:03:24,205 --> 01:03:26,485
And when the White Walkers
come for Bran,

1143
01:03:26,645 --> 01:03:30,405
there are terrible casualties.
Hodor is a goner.

1144
01:03:31,085 --> 01:03:36,005
Hold the door!
A completely pure act of protection.

1145
01:03:36,165 --> 01:03:39,325
There was nothing...
There was no greater goal

1146
01:03:39,485 --> 01:03:43,085
to what he did
other than protect Bran.

1147
01:03:44,725 --> 01:03:50,285
Everyone who's basically just given
in order to give way for Bran

1148
01:03:50,405 --> 01:03:54,005
and there must be a reason, right?

1149
01:03:54,165 --> 01:03:56,245
We know he's become
the Three-Eyed Raven

1150
01:03:59,285 --> 01:04:02,045
But how's he going
to use those powers.

1151
01:04:02,165 --> 01:04:04,405
And as the Three-Eyed Raven,

1152
01:04:04,525 --> 01:04:06,725
Bran resolves a great Stark secret

1153
01:04:06,885 --> 01:04:10,645
when he sees Jon Snow's
mother is Ned's sister Lyanna.

1154
01:04:12,645 --> 01:04:15,285
You understand what Ned's been
going through the whole time.

1155
01:04:15,445 --> 01:04:17,645
He made out that it was his son,
his bastard son,

1156
01:04:17,765 --> 01:04:19,725
but it was really his nephew.

1157
01:04:19,885 --> 01:04:23,445
But it confirms Jon Snow
is still half Stark

1158
01:04:23,605 --> 01:04:26,805
and, in season six,
he and Sansa march

1159
01:04:26,965 --> 01:04:29,885
on their family seat of Winterfell
to fight Ramsay Bolton

1160
01:04:30,045 --> 01:04:33,725
in what goes down in history
as the Battle of the Bastards.

1161
01:04:35,805 --> 01:04:40,205
Ramsay's now top dog, having murdered
his father and newborn brother.

1162
01:04:40,365 --> 01:04:43,725
If you want to say... You're going
to die tomorrow, Lord Bolton.

1163
01:04:43,885 --> 01:04:47,445
When you play the Game Of Thrones,
you either win or you die, you know,

1164
01:04:47,605 --> 01:04:49,685
and she knows
it's about winning now,

1165
01:04:49,845 --> 01:04:52,885
she's had enough of all the rest,
it's time to win.

1166
01:04:53,005 --> 01:04:55,245
She offers her insight.

1167
01:04:55,445 --> 01:04:59,165
You think he's going to fall into your trap,
he won't. He's the one who lays traps.

1168
01:04:59,325 --> 01:05:01,925
She's lived with this man
for a long time and she knows

1169
01:05:02,085 --> 01:05:06,125
that...
that he is cruel to the core.

1170
01:05:06,245 --> 01:05:08,885
Sansa's words go unheeded.

1171
01:05:09,045 --> 01:05:11,725
Ramsay baits Jon
with his hostage Rickon.

1172
01:05:11,845 --> 01:05:14,165
Run to your brother.

1173
01:05:14,325 --> 01:05:16,605
It shows a lot about
how Ramsay's mind works.

1174
01:05:17,685 --> 01:05:20,645
He's calculating, he's always
thinking about the next move.

1175
01:05:20,805 --> 01:05:24,725
You know, it's very interesting how
Machiavellian he can be as well.

1176
01:05:26,765 --> 01:05:29,925
I think everybody who was watching
that episode for the first time,

1177
01:05:30,085 --> 01:05:33,205
I think they all thought he was
probably likely going to make it.

1178
01:05:33,325 --> 01:05:34,685
Ugh! Argh!

1179
01:05:37,205 --> 01:05:39,125
It was just kind of
cut so short and I think

1180
01:05:39,285 --> 01:05:41,725
that's kind of what
Game Of Thrones is always about.

1181
01:05:44,325 --> 01:05:48,085
Ramsay Bolton's, like,
'Yes I've got you now, boy,

1182
01:05:48,245 --> 01:05:51,005
'just in the
middle of no-man's land.'

1183
01:05:53,205 --> 01:05:56,005
That's what Game Of Thrones
does so brilliantly,

1184
01:05:56,165 --> 01:06:00,445
it's constantly pitting good
moral forces against bad ones

1185
01:06:00,605 --> 01:06:02,485
and you don't just win
because you're good.

1186
01:06:02,605 --> 01:06:04,365
Argh! Argh!

1187
01:06:04,525 --> 01:06:06,925
They were surrounded
by the entire army,

1188
01:06:07,045 --> 01:06:09,565
they were being driven into the mud.

1189
01:06:09,725 --> 01:06:12,485
Ramsay should have won, he was
much more conniving and cunning

1190
01:06:12,645 --> 01:06:15,085
and if it hadn't have
been for Sansa coming in

1191
01:06:15,245 --> 01:06:17,565
at the last minute,
then he probably would have won.

1192
01:06:26,645 --> 01:06:29,125
She's a strong independent woman.
She's really powerful

1193
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:31,525
and she saves the day
and I think that's brilliant.

1194
01:06:31,685 --> 01:06:37,405
This was probably their first
major victory in six years.

1195
01:06:43,005 --> 01:06:46,245
They're suddenly inside the castle.
Winterfell.

1196
01:06:47,405 --> 01:06:50,005
It seems Jon will kill Ramsay.

1197
01:06:51,125 --> 01:06:54,005
But he then leaves
Sansa to take the scalp.

1198
01:06:55,125 --> 01:06:58,845
There was only one way to kill him and
Sansa found the right way to do it.

1199
01:07:00,325 --> 01:07:04,165
She knows what she's gonna do
and she knows he deserves it.

1200
01:07:04,285 --> 01:07:06,525
All memory of you will disappear.

1201
01:07:12,845 --> 01:07:16,005
If you were face to face
with your nemesis

1202
01:07:16,165 --> 01:07:19,765
and you had the opportunity,
you'd take it.

1203
01:07:19,885 --> 01:07:23,085
Aarrgghh! Argh!

1204
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:25,245
She's hardcore.

1205
01:07:25,405 --> 01:07:28,765
(BARKING)
She has the makings of a Cersei.

1206
01:07:28,925 --> 01:07:30,765
CHANT: The king is born!
The king is born!

1207
01:07:30,925 --> 01:07:34,125
But it's Jon Snow who becomes
king as the season ends,

1208
01:07:34,285 --> 01:07:38,085
with the Starks controlling the
North and Sansa is by his side.

1209
01:07:39,205 --> 01:07:41,165
She's a character
that will surprise people

1210
01:07:41,285 --> 01:07:43,685
because she's not what she seems.

1211
01:07:43,805 --> 01:07:46,725
And neither is Sansa's sister Arya.

1212
01:07:46,885 --> 01:07:49,845
Blinded and stabbed in her
training as a faceless man,

1213
01:07:50,005 --> 01:07:53,405
she's now back in Westeros
to deal with Walder Frey.

1214
01:07:54,525 --> 01:07:56,565
She's gone on this mad journey.

1215
01:07:57,645 --> 01:08:01,525
Arya comes in disguise,
having chopped up Walder's sons.

1216
01:08:04,525 --> 01:08:06,365
They weren't easy to carve.

1217
01:08:07,245 --> 01:08:10,405
She wanted him to see who she was.

1218
01:08:13,685 --> 01:08:17,805
The face comes off, there's a knife.
The last thing you'll ever see

1219
01:08:17,965 --> 01:08:20,165
is a Stark smiling
down at you as you die.

1220
01:08:20,685 --> 01:08:23,125
She's been caught up in it so young

1221
01:08:23,285 --> 01:08:26,325
that she's turning into
this child soldier.

1222
01:08:28,605 --> 01:08:30,885
Ugh! Ugh!

1223
01:08:31,005 --> 01:08:33,565
Revenge is a dish best taken cold.

1224
01:08:33,725 --> 01:08:37,725
I literally cannot wait now
for her and Cersei to face off.

1225
01:08:37,885 --> 01:08:41,085
In fact, Cersei elevates
revenge to an art form

1226
01:08:41,245 --> 01:08:45,605
in season six as the Lannisters fight
for their family's very survival.

1227
01:08:46,685 --> 01:08:49,485
These royal lovers
are united in grief

1228
01:08:49,645 --> 01:08:52,165
after the Sand Snakes
killed their daughter.

1229
01:08:52,325 --> 01:08:56,205
The Lannisters are all about power.
They're all about revenge.

1230
01:08:56,365 --> 01:08:58,965
We're the only ones who matter,
the only ones in this world

1231
01:08:59,125 --> 01:09:01,165
and everything
they've taken from us

1232
01:09:01,325 --> 01:09:03,205
we're going to take back and more.

1233
01:09:03,365 --> 01:09:07,365
It doesn't matter how long it takes,
they will get you back.

1234
01:09:07,525 --> 01:09:09,405
With Jaime sent away
to fight revolt,

1235
01:09:09,565 --> 01:09:13,125
Cersei is left alone to face judgment
by the Faith Militant. (BELL TOLLS)

1236
01:09:15,285 --> 01:09:18,005
We are told that Cersei
is going to turn up for a trial

1237
01:09:18,165 --> 01:09:20,765
but we know perfectly well
she's not going to.

1238
01:09:20,925 --> 01:09:24,605
But it's now she plays
a game-changing hand.

1239
01:09:24,765 --> 01:09:27,885
She was always going
to have a dastardly plan.

1240
01:09:28,965 --> 01:09:31,885
The man who was sent by Cersei
to hold Tommen in that room...

1241
01:09:32,045 --> 01:09:36,685
There's something wrong. Margaery
knows what's up in an instant.

1242
01:09:36,845 --> 01:09:39,845
The High Sept is packed with
those who've wronged Cersei.

1243
01:09:40,005 --> 01:09:43,205
The Tyrells, High Sparrow
and Faith Militant.

1244
01:09:43,405 --> 01:09:47,045
The amazing thing is the spectacle is
incredible and you never know it's coming.

1245
01:09:51,965 --> 01:09:53,525
This isn't gonna end well.

1246
01:09:59,565 --> 01:10:02,245
Cersei has, of course,
unleashed wildfire.

1247
01:10:02,405 --> 01:10:06,245
(SCREAMING) She's wiped out
this fantastic building,

1248
01:10:06,365 --> 01:10:08,285
she's destroyed all her enemies.

1249
01:10:08,445 --> 01:10:11,045
That's what makes
Cersei so brilliant,

1250
01:10:11,205 --> 01:10:13,325
she's been to the
absolute lowest place

1251
01:10:13,445 --> 01:10:15,365
that you could possibly go

1252
01:10:15,485 --> 01:10:18,045
and she still comes out on top.

1253
01:10:18,205 --> 01:10:22,605
In the moment where she gets
her revenge on everyone else,

1254
01:10:22,765 --> 01:10:27,685
she loses the only thing that
she has left that matters to her.

1255
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:32,045
Knowing that his mum's
the one that's

1256
01:10:32,165 --> 01:10:34,085
pretty much murdered his wife...

1257
01:10:37,805 --> 01:10:41,245
..what has he got to live for?
Tommen's death

1258
01:10:41,405 --> 01:10:45,085
leaves the Iron Throne empty,
so a new reign begins.

1259
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:48,325
A witch told her
that she was cursed

1260
01:10:48,485 --> 01:10:50,365
and that all
of her children would die.

1261
01:10:50,525 --> 01:10:53,765
It didn't stop her from loving her
kids and trying to protect them

1262
01:10:53,885 --> 01:10:57,565
at any cost but she accepts

1263
01:10:57,685 --> 01:11:00,885
very swiftly her fate.

1264
01:11:01,045 --> 01:11:06,085
And so Jaime returns to a new world
order, courtesy of his sister.

1265
01:11:07,165 --> 01:11:10,725
She's devastated the Tyrells.

1266
01:11:10,885 --> 01:11:14,085
Now the Lannisters are once more
a force to be reckoned with.

1267
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:19,085
Queen Cersei
sitting on the Iron Throne.

1268
01:11:22,125 --> 01:11:24,765
The fact that a woman has
managed to achieve that position

1269
01:11:24,925 --> 01:11:29,405
and get that much power, Tywin,
he would probably have been

1270
01:11:29,525 --> 01:11:32,045
reluctantly proud.

1271
01:11:32,205 --> 01:11:35,765
Then you go, 'OK, well, what are you
going to do with this Iron Throne?'

1272
01:11:35,885 --> 01:11:39,085
Jaime, he knows, not a lot of good.

1273
01:11:40,405 --> 01:11:43,885
He's wondering who she's going to
become now that she has the power.

1274
01:11:44,005 --> 01:11:46,405
As one queen takes the throne,

1275
01:11:46,565 --> 01:11:49,405
another sets sail
to challenge her for it.

1276
01:11:49,565 --> 01:11:52,805
Finally Daenerys,
the Targaryen queen,

1277
01:11:52,965 --> 01:11:55,965
is on her way to Westeros
with a vast alliance

1278
01:11:56,085 --> 01:11:58,285
she spent six seasons amassing.

1279
01:12:00,005 --> 01:12:03,325
We're now getting to crunch time.
The dragons flying overhead,

1280
01:12:03,485 --> 01:12:07,325
everybody on the boats,
'We're coming.' (LAUGHS)

1281
01:12:08,365 --> 01:12:12,565
Join us after the break
for the Targaryen invasion.

1282
01:12:22,165 --> 01:12:22,365
Welcome to Westeros where
the fight for the kingdom is on.

1283
01:12:26,245 --> 01:12:28,685
Welcome back to The Story So Far

1284
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:32,885
where, in season seven, Daenerys
finally lands on home soil,

1285
01:12:33,005 --> 01:12:36,045
he birthplace Dragonstone...

1286
01:12:37,845 --> 01:12:40,365
..along with her huge
alliance of power players.

1287
01:12:40,525 --> 01:12:45,525
To see this female character rise
to power and get to the point

1288
01:12:45,685 --> 01:12:49,725
where she's commanded thousands
of men, it's so magical.

1289
01:12:49,845 --> 01:12:52,725
Her allies want immediate invasion.

1290
01:12:52,885 --> 01:12:55,525
We have an army,
a fleet and three dragons.

1291
01:12:55,685 --> 01:12:59,285
We could hit King's Landing now,
hard, with everything we have.

1292
01:12:59,405 --> 01:13:01,325
The city will fall within a day.

1293
01:13:01,485 --> 01:13:04,285
Ellaria wants to take Cersei out
and all the Lannisters.

1294
01:13:04,445 --> 01:13:07,765
That's what she wants
and she feels now that her

1295
01:13:07,885 --> 01:13:10,765
and the Tyrells and the Greyjoys,

1296
01:13:10,925 --> 01:13:13,925
they're all there together,
just go and rip them out.

1297
01:13:14,085 --> 01:13:16,805
Tens of thousands will die in
the firestorm. It's called war.

1298
01:13:16,925 --> 01:13:19,045
Who can against these dragons?

1299
01:13:19,205 --> 01:13:21,445
But to avoid being seen
as foreign invaders,

1300
01:13:21,605 --> 01:13:24,325
Daenerys's hand Tyrion
has a more cunning plan.

1301
01:13:24,485 --> 01:13:26,565
You can't have
everybody hating you.

1302
01:13:26,725 --> 01:13:28,605
You've got to have
some people onside.

1303
01:13:28,765 --> 01:13:30,645
I think that's what
Tyrion is there for.

1304
01:13:30,765 --> 01:13:33,285
Then comes a fateful meeting.

1305
01:13:33,445 --> 01:13:36,845
In need of more allies, Daenerys
summons the king in the North,

1306
01:13:37,005 --> 01:13:40,405
Jon Snow.
He comes but with his own agenda.

1307
01:13:40,565 --> 01:13:42,885
He's learned there
is dragonglass there.

1308
01:13:43,005 --> 01:13:45,885
Jon's biggest goal is to prove

1309
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:48,965
to the southern part of Westeros

1310
01:13:49,125 --> 01:13:53,005
that the Night King is real
and that this threat's coming.

1311
01:13:53,165 --> 01:13:56,765
The dead are the enemy.
The dead?

1312
01:13:56,925 --> 01:14:00,725
The overall battle for humanity
itself is the greater battle.

1313
01:14:00,885 --> 01:14:04,845
Daenerys allows Jon to search
for this natural treasure.

1314
01:14:06,085 --> 01:14:08,565
Beneath dragonstone
is more dragonglass

1315
01:14:08,725 --> 01:14:10,885
than they'll ever need
to defeat the White Walkers

1316
01:14:11,045 --> 01:14:13,445
and it is key, in fact,
to defeating the White Walkers.

1317
01:14:13,565 --> 01:14:16,285
And they find ancient cave paintings.

1318
01:14:16,445 --> 01:14:20,005
The enemy is real.
Proof of White Walkers.

1319
01:14:20,125 --> 01:14:22,085
It's always been real.

1320
01:14:22,245 --> 01:14:25,925
He's taking the first steps
towards convincing Daenerys

1321
01:14:26,085 --> 01:14:29,885
that that threat is real and looking
for the ally he needs to fight it.

1322
01:14:30,005 --> 01:14:31,965
I will fight for the North.

1323
01:14:35,245 --> 01:14:37,565
When you bend the knee.

1324
01:14:37,685 --> 01:14:40,325
Aware of the impending invasion,

1325
01:14:40,485 --> 01:14:43,565
in the capital Queen Cersei
is more than up for a fight,

1326
01:14:43,725 --> 01:14:46,845
amassing weapons and allies
to face down the enemy.

1327
01:14:48,325 --> 01:14:52,405
Cersei is ruthless but she's
incredibly canny and clever

1328
01:14:52,525 --> 01:14:54,445
and that's whys he's lasted so long.

1329
01:14:54,605 --> 01:14:58,405
To think I listened to father
for 40 years and know nothing.

1330
01:14:59,925 --> 01:15:03,965
Cersei is very much
a chip off the old block.

1331
01:15:04,125 --> 01:15:07,725
We must stand together
if we hope to stop her.

1332
01:15:07,885 --> 01:15:10,925
The powerful Tarlys
reluctantly join them.

1333
01:15:11,085 --> 01:15:15,325
Randyll is the most successful
general in Westeros

1334
01:15:15,445 --> 01:15:18,405
and considered invincible.

1335
01:15:18,565 --> 01:15:21,685
She has three full-grown dragons,
Your Grace.

1336
01:15:21,845 --> 01:15:26,005
The same as Aegon when he
conquered the Seven Kingdoms.

1337
01:15:26,125 --> 01:15:29,365
How do you propose to stop them?

1338
01:15:29,485 --> 01:15:31,285
He acknowledges their power.

1339
01:15:31,445 --> 01:15:34,645
It's like saying, 'They've got
nuclear weapons, we don't.'

1340
01:15:36,045 --> 01:15:39,325
In fact, Cersei has
two secret new weapons.

1341
01:15:39,445 --> 01:15:41,445
A giant anti-dragon machine

1342
01:15:41,605 --> 01:15:45,285
and an approaching wildcard
with his very own fleet.

1343
01:15:46,485 --> 01:15:48,845
I love Euron Greyjoy.

1344
01:15:48,965 --> 01:15:50,885
He's set his heart on Cersei.

1345
01:15:52,085 --> 01:15:54,485
You invited the Greyjoys
to King's Landing.

1346
01:15:54,645 --> 01:15:56,925
Not all of them.
Well, it looks like all of them.

1347
01:15:57,085 --> 01:15:59,565
He wants power, he wants
to marry Cersei Lannister.

1348
01:15:59,685 --> 01:16:01,845
So here I am

1349
01:16:01,965 --> 01:16:03,885
with a thousand ships

1350
01:16:04,005 --> 01:16:05,845
and two good hands.

1351
01:16:06,005 --> 01:16:09,125
So, he says,
'OK, I'll bring you a present.'

1352
01:16:09,285 --> 01:16:13,325
I won't return to King's Landing
until I have that for you.

1353
01:16:13,445 --> 01:16:15,365
So he goes off with his fleet.

1354
01:16:17,605 --> 01:16:21,325
Euron... He delivers
a victory for Team Cersei,

1355
01:16:21,445 --> 01:16:23,365
knocking out her enemy's armada.

1356
01:16:23,525 --> 01:16:28,325
They get invaded
by Euron and his madness.

1357
01:16:28,445 --> 01:16:29,565
Aarrgghh!

1358
01:16:29,725 --> 01:16:32,885
So swashbuckley.
I mean, properly swashbuckley.

1359
01:16:33,045 --> 01:16:36,565
He manages to encircle Theon
and Yara's much smaller fleet.

1360
01:16:36,685 --> 01:16:39,405
And he takes Yara prisoner.

1361
01:16:39,525 --> 01:16:43,085
I have her. Come and get her.

1362
01:16:43,245 --> 01:16:46,245
Theon escapes in a really
embracing and cowardly way.

1363
01:16:48,965 --> 01:16:50,765
(LAUGHS)

1364
01:16:50,925 --> 01:16:54,525
Poor Theon. I mean,
he abandons his sister.

1365
01:16:54,685 --> 01:16:58,165
Jumps overboard early on in season
seven. Theon's scared of everyone.

1366
01:17:00,045 --> 01:17:03,965
Euron also captures
Ellaria Sand and her daughter.

1367
01:17:04,125 --> 01:17:08,205
And that is the gift
Euron presents to Cersei

1368
01:17:08,365 --> 01:17:12,645
because, of course, Ellaria
murdered Cersei's daughter Myrcella.

1369
01:17:13,925 --> 01:17:16,325
I'm the prize to take back to Cersei

1370
01:17:16,485 --> 01:17:20,125
so she can get her revenge on me,
which I don't want.

1371
01:17:20,285 --> 01:17:24,325
I give you what
no other man could give.

1372
01:17:24,445 --> 01:17:26,125
Justice.

1373
01:17:26,285 --> 01:17:29,045
He's pushing and
pushing and pushing...

1374
01:17:29,165 --> 01:17:31,245
There's only one reward I want.

1375
01:17:31,405 --> 01:17:35,365
..a wedge between, you know,
these kind of star-crossed lovers.

1376
01:17:35,525 --> 01:17:38,045
You shall have
what your heart desires...

1377
01:17:39,685 --> 01:17:41,845
..when the war is won.

1378
01:17:44,045 --> 01:17:46,525
In a double bluff,
Cersei lets her enemies

1379
01:17:46,645 --> 01:17:48,925
capture her family's ancestral home.

1380
01:17:50,085 --> 01:17:54,045
So, they're able to take Casterly
Rock surprisingly easily.

1381
01:17:54,205 --> 01:17:57,325
And, of course, that puts
them a little bit on edge.

1382
01:17:57,485 --> 01:18:01,005
In fact,
it's a strategic distraction...

1383
01:18:04,285 --> 01:18:08,405
..allowing Jaime to take his army
south to conquer House Tyrell

1384
01:18:08,525 --> 01:18:10,445
and steal its fortune.

1385
01:18:11,805 --> 01:18:13,765
The Lannisters, led by Jaime,

1386
01:18:13,925 --> 01:18:16,925
have very cleverly
gone to Highgarden.

1387
01:18:18,005 --> 01:18:20,365
I remember when the Lannisters
did go to pay their debts

1388
01:18:20,525 --> 01:18:23,325
by basically stealing
a load of gold from Highgarden.

1389
01:18:24,605 --> 01:18:28,165
That is where the money is and,
of course, they owe the Iron Bank

1390
01:18:28,285 --> 01:18:29,725
not an insignificant sum.

1391
01:18:32,005 --> 01:18:34,045
And Jaime goes to confront Olenna

1392
01:18:34,205 --> 01:18:37,685
who is, you know, kind of, like,
the last Tyrell of any consequence.

1393
01:18:37,845 --> 01:18:40,805
She's almost sitting there waiting
for him, she knows what's coming.

1394
01:18:40,965 --> 01:18:44,125
How will it happen? It was like
a business appointment, wasn't it?

1395
01:18:44,285 --> 01:18:47,685
It was like, 'Oh, hello.
And now you need to die.'

1396
01:18:49,725 --> 01:18:51,365
As a viewer, you were just winded.

1397
01:18:51,525 --> 01:18:56,005
But in her very last breath, Olenna
reveals she killed King Joffrey.

1398
01:18:56,165 --> 01:18:59,765
Tell Cersei,
I want her to know it was me.

1399
01:19:00,805 --> 01:19:04,325
Boom! (LAUGHS) You know, it's, like,

1400
01:19:04,485 --> 01:19:06,765
Game Of Thrones just delivers,
doesn't it?

1401
01:19:06,885 --> 01:19:08,805
(SHOUTING)

1402
01:19:10,485 --> 01:19:13,245
When news of the Lannister
victories reaches Daenerys,

1403
01:19:13,405 --> 01:19:17,045
she furiously abandons Tyrion's
softly, softly strategy

1404
01:19:17,165 --> 01:19:19,885
and she finally invades Westeros.

1405
01:19:21,845 --> 01:19:25,925
She's just had enough,
she is raining down her aggression

1406
01:19:26,085 --> 01:19:28,525
on top of them.
They're coming!

1407
01:19:32,525 --> 01:19:34,765
She's tired of being,
you know, bottled up

1408
01:19:34,925 --> 01:19:38,445
and being told that she shouldn't do
this. This is who she knows she is.

1409
01:19:38,605 --> 01:19:41,445
As the Lannister and Tarly
troops are eviscerated,

1410
01:19:41,605 --> 01:19:45,365
Jaime is confronted by the true
scale of the Dragon Queen's army.

1411
01:19:45,525 --> 01:19:49,325
He has looked into the
face of the future of war

1412
01:19:49,485 --> 01:19:51,365
and they're on
the losing side of it.

1413
01:19:51,525 --> 01:19:54,485
They might have held against
the charge of the Dothraki

1414
01:19:54,645 --> 01:19:57,325
but not when you've got
a dragon flying towards you.

1415
01:20:00,285 --> 01:20:03,685
Jaime makes this absolutely
ridiculous decision

1416
01:20:03,845 --> 01:20:06,885
to have one final choice
and be the queen slayer,

1417
01:20:07,045 --> 01:20:10,365
forgetting there's a gigantic
dragon just over his shoulder.

1418
01:20:10,525 --> 01:20:13,285
After Jaime escapes,
Daenerys gives the survivors,

1419
01:20:13,445 --> 01:20:16,605
along with Randyll Tarly,
a brutal ultimatum.

1420
01:20:16,725 --> 01:20:18,885
(ROARS)

1421
01:20:19,885 --> 01:20:21,845
Join her or fry.

1422
01:20:22,925 --> 01:20:26,725
Randyll is captive at this point
and resigned to his fate.

1423
01:20:26,845 --> 01:20:28,325
Step forward, my lord.

1424
01:20:28,485 --> 01:20:32,125
He's unimpressed by Daenerys
co-opting a foreign army

1425
01:20:32,285 --> 01:20:37,845
of savages and laying waste to those
that she encounters in battle.

1426
01:20:38,005 --> 01:20:41,205
You will not kneel?
I already have a queen.

1427
01:20:41,365 --> 01:20:45,485
She needs to stake her ground here
and she needs to make examples

1428
01:20:45,645 --> 01:20:47,685
of her enemies when they
refuse to bend the knee,

1429
01:20:47,845 --> 01:20:49,845
so that she can do
what she ultimately

1430
01:20:50,005 --> 01:20:52,245
needs to do politically
in this country.

1431
01:20:52,365 --> 01:20:53,565
Dracarys.

1432
01:20:53,685 --> 01:20:55,605
(SCREAMING)

1433
01:20:55,765 --> 01:20:57,645
What sort of leader
will Daenerys be?

1434
01:20:57,805 --> 01:21:01,765
Will she be a fair ruler
or will she be the Mad King?

1435
01:21:02,925 --> 01:21:05,925
Away from the fighting,
the remaining Stark family

1436
01:21:06,045 --> 01:21:07,965
is reunited in season seven

1437
01:21:08,085 --> 01:21:10,605
as Bran and Arya finally make it home

1438
01:21:10,765 --> 01:21:14,405
to the delight of Sansa,
the new Lady of Winterfell.

1439
01:21:18,325 --> 01:21:20,325
They're not the
people that they were.

1440
01:21:20,445 --> 01:21:22,325
They're not the kids that had those

1441
01:21:22,485 --> 01:21:24,725
cute little wolf pups
back in series one.

1442
01:21:24,845 --> 01:21:26,205
You came home.

1443
01:21:29,045 --> 01:21:32,045
But it's not as harmonious
as one would hope.

1444
01:21:32,205 --> 01:21:34,165
They haven't been together
for so long and they

1445
01:21:34,325 --> 01:21:36,205
viewed the past in
entirely different ways.

1446
01:21:36,365 --> 01:21:39,165
I remember you standing on that
platform with Joffrey and Cersei

1447
01:21:39,325 --> 01:21:41,205
when they dragged
father to the block.

1448
01:21:41,365 --> 01:21:45,365
They are sisters but they could,
in a blink, become sworn enemies.

1449
01:21:45,525 --> 01:21:48,685
You should be
on your knees thanking me.

1450
01:21:48,845 --> 01:21:52,405
We're standing in Winterfell
again because of me.

1451
01:21:52,565 --> 01:21:57,045
We were expecting sisterly love
and tears and all of that.

1452
01:21:57,205 --> 01:21:59,085
It was quite the opposite of that,
wasn't it?

1453
01:21:59,245 --> 01:22:03,285
And in the shadows, Littlefinger
is stoking the tension between them.

1454
01:22:03,405 --> 01:22:04,885
What do you think she's after?

1455
01:22:05,045 --> 01:22:07,485
You think, 'Is this all going
to implode from the inside?'

1456
01:22:07,605 --> 01:22:09,845
You stand accused of murder.

1457
01:22:09,965 --> 01:22:12,605
You stand accused of treason.

1458
01:22:12,725 --> 01:22:14,845
How do you answer these charges...

1459
01:22:17,605 --> 01:22:20,005
..Lord Baelish?

1460
01:22:20,165 --> 01:22:22,925
But it all backfires
for the arch schemer

1461
01:22:23,085 --> 01:22:26,125
as he's finally outwitted
and beaten at his own game.

1462
01:22:27,045 --> 01:22:31,165
The youngest wolves of the pack
have found their way to unite

1463
01:22:31,285 --> 01:22:33,365
and use all their skills together.

1464
01:22:33,525 --> 01:22:37,085
None of you knows the truth.
You've held a knife to his throat.

1465
01:22:37,245 --> 01:22:42,205
Bran has now been replaced
by this Three-Eyed Raven...

1466
01:22:42,365 --> 01:22:44,565
You said,
'I did warn you not to trust me.'

1467
01:22:44,725 --> 01:22:47,845
..who is this all-seeing,
all-knowing,

1468
01:22:47,965 --> 01:22:50,645
kind of slightly sinister power.

1469
01:22:50,805 --> 01:22:54,085
He just didn't see it.
He is the puppeteer.

1470
01:22:54,245 --> 01:22:57,325
I was expecting him
to be much more clever.

1471
01:22:57,485 --> 01:23:01,005
Turn family against family,
turn sister against sister,

1472
01:23:01,165 --> 01:23:03,205
that's what you did
to our mother and Aunt Lysa.

1473
01:23:03,365 --> 01:23:05,245
And that's what
you tried to do to us.

1474
01:23:05,405 --> 01:23:08,885
He's got his comeuppance... (LAUGHS)
..at the hand of Ned's kids.

1475
01:23:14,765 --> 01:23:18,205
And even farther north,
a vital quest has begun.

1476
01:23:18,365 --> 01:23:21,285
In order to unite the warring
kingdoms of Westeros against

1477
01:23:21,445 --> 01:23:24,845
the true enemy heading their way,
Jon Snow leads a mission

1478
01:23:24,965 --> 01:23:26,885
beyond the wall.

1479
01:23:27,045 --> 01:23:30,845
It's their plan to go north,
capture a wight...

1480
01:23:30,965 --> 01:23:32,725
(SNARLS)

1481
01:23:32,885 --> 01:23:35,925
..and bring it down south
and just show people

1482
01:23:36,085 --> 01:23:38,725
for once and for all
that there is this threat.

1483
01:23:39,925 --> 01:23:42,205
After bagging a wight,
they are surrounded.

1484
01:23:46,085 --> 01:23:50,485
And it falls on Daenerys and
her dragons to fly to the rescue.

1485
01:23:50,605 --> 01:23:52,885
She's there to save Jon.

1486
01:23:54,125 --> 01:23:56,725
There's a mad battle
raging on all sides

1487
01:23:56,885 --> 01:24:00,605
but the moment the Night King just
very slowly picks up an ice spear...

1488
01:24:01,965 --> 01:24:03,925
Ugh!

1489
01:24:04,045 --> 01:24:06,285
This is a pretty massive moment.

1490
01:24:11,805 --> 01:24:14,165
Not only does he kill the dragon...
(ROARS)

1491
01:24:18,285 --> 01:24:21,765
..the Night King has gained one of
the most powerful weapons imaginable.

1492
01:24:21,925 --> 01:24:25,725
They escape with
a captive wight in tow

1493
01:24:25,845 --> 01:24:28,045
but it comes at a great cost

1494
01:24:28,205 --> 01:24:31,925
as the Army of the Dead
swarm in to claim their prize.

1495
01:24:33,325 --> 01:24:36,205
When he kills the dragon, you're
devastated. You think that's it.

1496
01:24:38,845 --> 01:24:42,325
When he revives the dragon
and it becomes one of them,

1497
01:24:42,485 --> 01:24:46,285
it's more than a turnaround,
it's pretty devastating.

1498
01:24:52,645 --> 01:24:55,285
Which leads to a dramatic reveal

1499
01:24:55,445 --> 01:24:59,165
as Daenerys and Jon bring their
deadly evidence down to the capital.

1500
01:24:59,325 --> 01:25:02,365
Against the odds,
Jaime's persuaded Cersei to meet

1501
01:25:02,525 --> 01:25:05,965
her enemies at a peace summit.
They plan to beg her for a truce

1502
01:25:06,125 --> 01:25:08,365
and to join the fight
against the dead.

1503
01:25:09,445 --> 01:25:11,925
Cersei and Daenerys coming
face to face for the first time

1504
01:25:12,085 --> 01:25:14,365
that's, you know,
the clash of titans.

1505
01:25:21,485 --> 01:25:23,645
There are so many
of them at play there.

1506
01:25:23,805 --> 01:25:26,005
You've got the Greyjoys,
you've got the Lannisters.

1507
01:25:27,045 --> 01:25:29,005
And suddenly Euron is so volatile.

1508
01:25:29,165 --> 01:25:32,045
We are all facing a unique...
Theon!

1509
01:25:32,205 --> 01:25:36,365
I have you sister.
If you don't submit to me here now,

1510
01:25:36,485 --> 01:25:38,685
I'll kill her.

1511
01:25:38,805 --> 01:25:40,725
When there's that first face-off,

1512
01:25:40,885 --> 01:25:43,165
you've got Cersei
and Daenerys over here.

1513
01:25:43,325 --> 01:25:46,925
You have my word.
The word of a would-be usurper.

1514
01:25:47,085 --> 01:25:51,525
There is no conversation that
will erase the last 50 years.

1515
01:25:52,845 --> 01:25:54,685
We have something to show you.

1516
01:25:54,805 --> 01:25:56,685
When the Hound releases the wight...

1517
01:25:57,685 --> 01:26:01,125
And the dead come out
and go straight for Cersei.

1518
01:26:01,245 --> 01:26:02,725
(ROARS)

1519
01:26:04,525 --> 01:26:07,645
..it is the visceral payoff
that we've all been waiting for

1520
01:26:07,805 --> 01:26:10,725
and it is the theatrics
that Jon and Tyrion intend.

1521
01:26:10,885 --> 01:26:13,685
This is the only thing I've
ever seen that terrifies me.

1522
01:26:13,845 --> 01:26:16,165
It seems Euron Greyjoy
is turning tail

1523
01:26:16,285 --> 01:26:18,205
and deserting his queen.

1524
01:26:18,365 --> 01:26:20,925
They call your bluff,
they don't actually have anyone

1525
01:26:21,085 --> 01:26:24,325
get killed in that scene,
it becomes something else entirely.

1526
01:26:24,485 --> 01:26:28,125
A darkness is coming for us all. And
Cersei appears to support a truce.

1527
01:26:28,245 --> 01:26:30,165
We'll face it together.

1528
01:26:30,325 --> 01:26:32,245
When she agrees,
you just think, 'Oh,

1529
01:26:32,405 --> 01:26:34,805
'this is just going
to go horribly wrong.'

1530
01:26:34,925 --> 01:26:36,845
In fact, nothing is as it seems.

1531
01:26:37,005 --> 01:26:40,045
We'll meet at Lord Harroway's Town
and march together to Winterfell.

1532
01:26:40,205 --> 01:26:42,805
Ser Jaime.
Your Grace.

1533
01:26:42,965 --> 01:26:45,925
He's organising the troops,
saying, 'We're going to go north,

1534
01:26:46,085 --> 01:26:48,805
'we're going to help people out,
let's get it together.'

1535
01:26:48,965 --> 01:26:51,565
And the she's, like, 'You're stupid.
We're not ding that.'

1536
01:26:51,725 --> 01:26:53,885
Do you really think
Euron Greyjoy will turn tail

1537
01:26:54,005 --> 01:26:55,525
and sail back to the Iron Islands?

1538
01:26:55,685 --> 01:26:59,285
You see Cersei not sending
the Lannister troops

1539
01:26:59,445 --> 01:27:04,365
but instead sending Euron Greyjoy
down to Essos for the mercenaries.

1540
01:27:04,485 --> 01:27:06,205
You plotted with Euron Greyjoy?

1541
01:27:06,325 --> 01:27:08,805
She will stop at nothing Cersei.

1542
01:27:08,965 --> 01:27:11,965
Even though Cersei
has revealed she's pregnant

1543
01:27:12,125 --> 01:27:17,005
with a Lannister baby to bolster
their dynasty, Jaime now leaves her.

1544
01:27:17,165 --> 01:27:20,485
Those Lannisters, man. They have
a complicated relationship.

1545
01:27:21,525 --> 01:27:24,885
He's a man of honour and, in the end,
he's going to be true to his word.

1546
01:27:25,005 --> 01:27:26,925
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

1547
01:27:27,085 --> 01:27:29,565
As one incestuous pairing
hits the rocks,

1548
01:27:29,685 --> 01:27:31,605
another is setting sail.

1549
01:27:32,965 --> 01:27:35,085
Jon has now best the knee to Daenerys

1550
01:27:35,245 --> 01:27:37,365
and they can
no longer deny their love.

1551
01:27:39,725 --> 01:27:43,645
It's almost like seeing
a god and a goddess.

1552
01:27:45,085 --> 01:27:47,245
You've been wanting
them to become lovers

1553
01:27:47,405 --> 01:27:51,325
and you get the loving moment as
you're totally given the information

1554
01:27:51,485 --> 01:27:54,045
that you're
watching incest right now.

1555
01:27:54,205 --> 01:27:56,965
In fact, Jon's fallen
for his own auntie.

1556
01:27:57,125 --> 01:28:00,605
In a vision, Bran sees that Jon's
father is Dany's older brother

1557
01:28:00,725 --> 01:28:02,645
Rhaegar Targaryen.

1558
01:28:02,805 --> 01:28:05,965
Prince Rhaegar married Lyanna Stark
in a secret ceremony,

1559
01:28:06,125 --> 01:28:09,645
which makes Jon Aegon Targaryen's
true heir to the throne.

1560
01:28:09,765 --> 01:28:11,685
He's never been a bastard.

1561
01:28:15,925 --> 01:28:17,885
He's the heir to the Iron Throne.

1562
01:28:18,045 --> 01:28:22,325
Even if culturally
Game Of Thrones can handle incest,

1563
01:28:22,485 --> 01:28:26,565
you know Jon and Daenerys probably
won't be able to handle that.

1564
01:28:29,245 --> 01:28:32,525
But eclipsing all developments
and personal struggles,

1565
01:28:32,685 --> 01:28:36,725
in the North, the season ends
on a cataclysmic event

1566
01:28:36,885 --> 01:28:42,005
that changes the game
for every living human being.

1567
01:28:42,125 --> 01:28:44,045
This is the moment that we were told

1568
01:28:44,205 --> 01:28:47,125
could never happen.
The Wall can never come down.

1569
01:28:47,285 --> 01:28:51,805
You see the army
kind of coming out of the forest.

1570
01:28:54,605 --> 01:28:56,925
And then you hear something.

1571
01:28:57,045 --> 01:28:58,885
(SHRIEKING)

1572
01:28:59,045 --> 01:29:02,245
Oh, that's just changed
the whole ballgame here.

1573
01:29:05,965 --> 01:29:09,805
It didn't occur to me that we
would have a dragon White Walker.

1574
01:29:09,925 --> 01:29:11,845
(SHRIEKS)

1575
01:29:12,685 --> 01:29:16,605
But when that happened, you thought,
'Oh, yes, this is inevitable.'

1576
01:29:16,765 --> 01:29:19,765
Now this takes us on
a whole different journey.

1577
01:29:22,045 --> 01:29:25,085
That's when you know
it's on for next season.

1578
01:29:25,245 --> 01:29:27,805
There's nothing to protect
them in the south any more.

1579
01:29:29,565 --> 01:29:32,765
I mean, you can't have
a cliffhanger greater than that.

1580
01:29:32,925 --> 01:29:35,245
I don't know what's going
to happen but I can't wait.

1581
01:29:45,845 --> 01:29:48,725
