1
00:00:00,318 --> 00:00:01,662
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:01,665 --> 00:00:03,678
and I am the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:03,681 --> 00:00:05,059
To the outside world,

4
00:00:05,062 --> 00:00:07,217
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

5
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,962
but secretly, with the help of
my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

6
00:00:09,965 --> 00:00:12,763
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

7
00:00:12,766 --> 00:00:15,150
But when my daughter came
back from the future to help,

8
00:00:15,153 --> 00:00:17,590
she changed the present,

9
00:00:17,593 --> 00:00:20,149
and now our world is
more dangerous than ever,

10
00:00:20,152 --> 00:00:22,696
and I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.

11
00:00:22,698 --> 00:00:25,304
I am the Flash.

12
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,577
- Previously on "The Flash"...
- I'll deliver it myself.

13
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:30,704
That is Eobard Thawne,
the Reverse Flash.

14
00:00:30,706 --> 00:00:32,469
- He killed my mother.
- I didn't know that.

15
00:00:32,472 --> 00:00:34,024
My life is a million times better

16
00:00:34,026 --> 00:00:35,626
and it's all because of you, Gracie.

17
00:00:38,288 --> 00:00:40,630
She may never wake.

18
00:00:40,633 --> 00:00:45,636
Every meta will die.

19
00:00:45,638 --> 00:00:47,871
This is a DNA sample from Cicada.

20
00:00:47,873 --> 00:00:49,873
We can make a meta-human cure.

21
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,250
What if the key to defeating
him is appealing to his heart?

22
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:54,419
- How do we do that?
- By saving his child.

23
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:56,480
We need to wake up Grace.

24
00:00:58,309 --> 00:00:59,808
I want you to think about

25
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,760
the biggest secret in your life.

26
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:04,763
The one you keep from
the people that you love

27
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:07,057
or even from yourself.

28
00:01:07,059 --> 00:01:08,909
I want you to imagine what would happen

29
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:11,937
if that secret got out.

30
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:14,522
Remember when you asked me that?

31
00:01:14,524 --> 00:01:17,659
I've been using all of your training.

32
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:21,738
Studying my pulse,
managing micro-expressions,

33
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,573
limiting non-congruent gestures,

34
00:01:23,575 --> 00:01:26,826
destroying any piece of evidence.

35
00:01:26,828 --> 00:01:31,098
I don't know how much
longer I can keep this up.

36
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,458
And not just because of the risks.

37
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:39,848
But because the closer
I get to my parents,

38
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,444
the more I feel like I'm hurting them.

39
00:01:43,446 --> 00:01:45,279
Data entry complete, Gideon.

40
00:01:45,281 --> 00:01:47,639
Thank you, Nora West-Allen.

41
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:50,725
Shall I send this to the usual recipient?

42
00:01:50,727 --> 00:01:52,286
Yes.

43
00:01:52,288 --> 00:01:54,529
Send it to Eobard Thawne,

44
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:57,124
priority level urgent.

45

46
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,043
You ready for this?

47
00:02:04,046 --> 00:02:05,829
Dad, I'm just... I'm
not fast enough yet.

48
00:02:05,832 --> 00:02:08,635
No backing out now, this is
the biggest race of your life.

49
00:02:08,638 --> 00:02:11,472
- Get ready, set, go!
- Not really. Dad, Dad...

50
00:02:11,474 --> 00:02:14,666
Wait, wait! Oh, God.

51
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:18,044
Whoa, whoa.

52
00:02:18,046 --> 00:02:19,838
Gotcha.

53
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,767
This is so embarrassing.

54
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:26,376
I'm really good at the ice
skating game on my Pocket Pal!

55
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:27,896
Okay, you're just
gonna bend your knees...

56
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,639
- Kay.
- And lead forward a little.

57
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:31,023
Just, yeah.

58
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:32,181
Yeah.

59
00:02:32,184 --> 00:02:33,594
- I'm doing it.
- You're doing it.

60
00:02:33,597 --> 00:02:36,346
I'm skating. This is
like schway city, Mom.

61
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:37,647
Thanks.

62
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:43,337
Look at you guys.

63
00:02:43,339 --> 00:02:46,015
- Such a mom.
- What? What about you?

64
00:02:46,018 --> 00:02:48,676
You're the one who sprang for
ice skating and game night.

65
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:51,489
Yeah, well, I know when Nora got hurt,

66
00:02:51,492 --> 00:02:53,808
I got a little frustrated.

67
00:02:53,811 --> 00:02:57,118
And now, I mean, we have an
actual plan to stop Cicada.

68
00:02:57,121 --> 00:02:59,961
Waking up his niece
to appeal to his heart.

69
00:02:59,963 --> 00:03:03,518
I know Dwyer's a killer,
but he's still a person,

70
00:03:03,521 --> 00:03:05,163
and he loves Grace
just like we love Nora.

71
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:06,509
So I don't know. I just feel like

72
00:03:06,511 --> 00:03:08,270
everything's heading
in the right direction.

73
00:03:08,273 --> 00:03:10,290
Here I come. Coming in. Here we go.

74
00:03:10,293 --> 00:03:12,036
I'm sorry, why are you wearing a helmet?

75
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:13,200
I thought you were made of rubber.

76
00:03:13,202 --> 00:03:15,035
Somebody's gotta set a
good example for these kids.

77
00:03:15,037 --> 00:03:17,121
Well... I thought you
grew up on the ice.

78
00:03:17,124 --> 00:03:18,521
Well, I did, basically,

79
00:03:18,523 --> 00:03:21,191
my mom dated a zamboni operator, so...

80
00:03:21,193 --> 00:03:24,527
And I tell you where I'm from
we don't date zamboni drivers.

81
00:03:24,529 --> 00:03:26,362
Why is that? Because
there are no zambonis.

82
00:03:26,364 --> 00:03:28,215
How do we clear the
ice? All winter long,

83
00:03:28,217 --> 00:03:30,427
we are on our hands and
knees with a squeegee in hand.

84
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,552
Let me tell you.

85
00:03:31,554 --> 00:03:33,699
Best eight months of
the year for this guy.

86
00:03:33,702 --> 00:03:35,201
It's a really great story, Sherlock.

87
00:03:35,204 --> 00:03:36,247
Sherloque.

88
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:37,749
You know, speaking of squeegeeing,

89
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,301
you know who could
use a good squeegeeing

90
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:42,229
is Larry Blumenthal. He's dead.

91
00:03:42,231 --> 00:03:44,421
- Larry Blumenthal is dead?
- Yeah.

92
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:46,594
The patent registrar
across the hall from you

93
00:03:46,597 --> 00:03:48,384
with the 400 square footage...

94
00:03:48,386 --> 00:03:50,929
- And the courtyard views?
- Yeah, dead as a doornail.

95
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:52,647
You can have that place if
you want it. Yours to rent.

96
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,432
What? Oh, my God. This is perfect.

97
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,577
I mean, my ad revenue has
been up this quarter, so...

98
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:58,394
Yeah, with the extra
space you'd be able to hire

99
00:03:58,396 --> 00:04:00,230
editors, photographers.

100
00:04:00,232 --> 00:04:03,441
I could turn my blog
into a real newspaper.

101
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:05,452
Oh, my package has arrived.

102
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,162
What package?

103
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:09,447
This is the solution
to all our problems.

104
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,167
Allez, les amis. We must go.

105
00:04:14,037 --> 00:04:16,729
Madames et monsieurs,
may I present to you

106
00:04:16,732 --> 00:04:18,599
La Machine à Mémoire,

107
00:04:18,601 --> 00:04:20,458
or as they say in Amérique, you know...

108
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,541
The Memory Machine.

109
00:04:21,544 --> 00:04:24,586
Oui, Iris. Memory Machine. Many times...

110
00:04:24,589 --> 00:04:26,940
I have entered into people's minds

111
00:04:26,942 --> 00:04:28,776
using this very technology.

112
00:04:28,778 --> 00:04:30,760
From the unfortunate comatose victims

113
00:04:30,762 --> 00:04:32,521
of the Summerholt Institute to, yes,

114
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:34,222
Jervis Tetch himself,

115
00:04:34,224 --> 00:04:36,871
the Terrible Mad Hatter
Killer from Earth-221.

116
00:04:36,874 --> 00:04:39,970
I come back from
Tannhauser for one second,

117
00:04:39,973 --> 00:04:42,790
just borrowing a
splicer for the meta cure

118
00:04:42,792 --> 00:04:44,440
and what do I find?

119
00:04:44,442 --> 00:04:46,442
- This, this...
- Machine à Mémoire.

120
00:04:46,444 --> 00:04:49,630
Whatever. How did you even
get this here from Earth-221?

121
00:04:49,632 --> 00:04:52,271
Well, I used the Forerunner
Multiversal Delivery Service.

122
00:04:52,274 --> 00:04:54,200
You don't use it? You don't
have a gold card like me?

123
00:04:54,202 --> 00:04:56,462
- Maybe I'll get you a discount.
- We don't need a discount.

124
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:58,204
All right, we just
need to wake up Grace.

125
00:04:58,206 --> 00:04:59,548
This'll wake her up, right?

126
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,791
So in most coma patients,

127
00:05:01,793 --> 00:05:03,924
high traffic areas of brain activity

128
00:05:03,927 --> 00:05:07,147
go dormant and the low
traffic areas spring to life,

129
00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:09,674
but unfortunately, Grace isn't normal.

130
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:12,320
Not only has her coma lasted
longer than the average,

131
00:05:12,323 --> 00:05:14,470
but her consciousness
has isolated itself

132
00:05:14,472 --> 00:05:16,578
into one specific region,

133
00:05:16,581 --> 00:05:18,263
her long-term memories.

134
00:05:18,266 --> 00:05:20,257
It will be so facile,
easy peasy for you.

135
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:24,480
All you do is you
transmit your brainwaves

136
00:05:24,482 --> 00:05:26,149
into Grace's memories, right?

137
00:05:26,152 --> 00:05:28,418
And then you'll lead her consciousness

138
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,983
out of a neural nexus portal.

139
00:05:30,986 --> 00:05:33,441
And Grace awakens.

140
00:05:33,444 --> 00:05:35,091
It's sort of like when Barry woke me up

141
00:05:35,094 --> 00:05:36,634
when the Thinker trapped me.

142
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:39,198
Surprisingly, that
sounds kind of easy peasy.

143
00:05:39,201 --> 00:05:41,702
As long as Grace's unusual brain damage

144
00:05:41,705 --> 00:05:44,277
doesn't cause any unforeseen risks.

145
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,022
This is why I suggest
you travel in pairs

146
00:05:46,025 --> 00:05:47,312
when you're using this technology.

147
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:49,831
Every time I enter
into someone's memories

148
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:52,442
when I use this I went
with my partner for sure.

149
00:05:52,444 --> 00:05:56,170
Your partner's name didn't
happen to be Watson, did it?

150
00:05:56,173 --> 00:05:58,614
No, his name was not Watson.

151
00:05:58,616 --> 00:06:00,968
His name was Watsune.

152
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,328
Yes, together we went through
dozens of minds, together...

153
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,089
Until one time I found myself

154
00:06:06,091 --> 00:06:09,125
in a memory of a motel room in Montreal

155
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:13,463
where what do I find but
Watsune in flagrante deli

156
00:06:13,465 --> 00:06:16,650
in interpersonal
relationship with my wife,

157
00:06:16,652 --> 00:06:18,583
fourth wife, but still.

158
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:21,061
You're saying you could
see your partner's memories?

159
00:06:21,064 --> 00:06:25,567
It's a possible side effect
of traveling in pairs.

160
00:06:25,569 --> 00:06:27,529
And speaking of which,

161
00:06:27,532 --> 00:06:29,167
which pairs would like to
volunteer for this mission?

162
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:30,261
I suggest the speedsters

163
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,629
for this to be accomplished so quick.

164
00:06:31,631 --> 00:06:33,759
- Yeah.
- Elected.

165
00:06:33,762 --> 00:06:36,458
Hey, if you see a memory of
me stealing blank Scrabble tile

166
00:06:36,461 --> 00:06:37,988
it's not what it looks like, all right?

167
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,362
That's a good one, Dad.

168
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:42,107
All that is left is to
connect this transceiver disc

169
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,942
to Grace's EEG and we can transmit.

170
00:06:44,945 --> 00:06:46,254
- Great.
- Right.

171
00:06:46,256 --> 00:06:47,538
All right, first thing tomorrow,

172
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,208
we save Grace.

173
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,750
Any big plans for the night off?

174
00:06:51,753 --> 00:06:53,186
I'm gonna crash.

175
00:06:53,188 --> 00:06:55,115
Killer Frost was up all
night watching movies

176
00:06:55,118 --> 00:06:57,765
from her two favorite
Johns, Woo and Hughes.

177
00:06:57,768 --> 00:07:00,176
Huh, I'm more of a Ford
and Waters man myself,

178
00:07:00,178 --> 00:07:02,947
but I will be up all night
yet again working with

179
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,074
the radiated meta-human
sample you guys got me.

180
00:07:05,077 --> 00:07:06,867
There's something
missing with this cure.

181
00:07:06,869 --> 00:07:08,184
All right, I'll see you guys later.

182
00:07:08,186 --> 00:07:09,424
- All right.
- Night.

183
00:07:09,427 --> 00:07:11,537
You know, there's something
that I'm missing too.

184
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,948
- Your freshly healed hands.
- Odd choice of words.

185
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,709
Well, I'm meeting with
an informant tonight

186
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,786
and he might have a
lead on Dwyer's location,

187
00:07:17,788 --> 00:07:19,904
but I'm not sure if I should trust him.

188
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:22,073
So you need me to vibe him. Look, man.

189
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:25,701
I should really be working on this cure.

190
00:07:25,703 --> 00:07:28,889
But my splicer algorithm

191
00:07:28,891 --> 00:07:31,550
won't technically be
done until 3:00 a.m.

192
00:07:31,553 --> 00:07:35,302
Thanks, man, this is, this
is really important work.

193
00:07:35,305 --> 00:07:36,879
Okay.

194
00:07:46,367 --> 00:07:48,191
Okay, Gideon, how do I hack this thing

195
00:07:48,193 --> 00:07:50,077
so that Dad won't see my memories?

196
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,498
In any configuration,

197
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:53,195
if you and Barry Allen go in together,

198
00:07:53,198 --> 00:07:55,916
you still risk exposing your memories.

199
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:58,326
So I can't do anything.

200
00:08:13,685 --> 00:08:16,085
- Gideon, is that...
- Grace Gibbons' brain waves.

201
00:08:16,087 --> 00:08:17,628
It would appear Sherloque Wells

202
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,347
has planted the transceiver disc.

203
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:21,922
So I can go in alone.

204
00:08:21,925 --> 00:08:23,717
And I'll be back before anyone notices,

205
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,903
but by that time
Grace'll be awake anyway.

206
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:30,099
Activating brain wave transmission.

207
00:08:30,101 --> 00:08:33,703
In three, two, one.

208
00:08:40,796 --> 00:08:43,371
CCPD?

209
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:47,961
Okay, Jones, here's the kid.

210
00:08:47,964 --> 00:08:50,470
We found her in the car
hiding under the seat.

211
00:08:50,472 --> 00:08:52,751
Her parents were at the
ATM when the meta attacked.

212
00:08:52,754 --> 00:08:55,216
Damn. We located her next of kin?

213
00:08:55,218 --> 00:08:57,001
Maybe an uncle. Still tracking down

214
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,213
his last known address.

215
00:08:58,216 --> 00:08:59,721
Well, she can't sleep on this bench.

216
00:08:59,723 --> 00:09:02,173
We've gotta get her out of here.

217
00:09:02,175 --> 00:09:05,510
God, poor kid.

218
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:08,471
- Who are you?
- You can see me?

219
00:09:08,473 --> 00:09:11,803
Oh, right, you're Grace's consciousness

220
00:09:11,806 --> 00:09:14,035
in her old memory.

221
00:09:14,037 --> 00:09:16,145
I'm Nora.

222
00:09:16,147 --> 00:09:19,240
Can you take me to my parents?

223
00:09:19,242 --> 00:09:22,652
No, um, I can't,

224
00:09:22,654 --> 00:09:25,663
but if you come with me,
I can help you feel better.

225
00:09:27,283 --> 00:09:29,342
You know,

226
00:09:29,344 --> 00:09:33,346
when I was your age, I had
a friend just like this.

227
00:09:33,348 --> 00:09:37,017
I bet he'd like to feel better too.

228
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:39,060
Yeah.

229
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:45,600
Okay.

230
00:09:45,602 --> 00:09:48,862
All right, Gracie, let's get you through

231
00:09:48,864 --> 00:09:50,661
this portal and out of your coma

232
00:09:50,664 --> 00:09:53,228
before anyone notices I snuck in here.

233
00:09:53,231 --> 00:09:55,601
Oh, no.

234
00:09:55,603 --> 00:09:58,163
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

235
00:10:00,545 --> 00:10:01,961
Oh, no.

236
00:10:01,964 --> 00:10:03,376
I'm trapped.

237
00:10:06,451 --> 00:10:08,729
We're gonna find a way
out of here, I promise.

238
00:10:08,732 --> 00:10:11,818
I feel like I've been in this
police station for a long time,

239
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:14,396
and now I'm gonna be
here forever, aren't I?

240
00:10:14,398 --> 00:10:17,349
Just leave me alone.

241
00:10:17,351 --> 00:10:19,160
You know, when I was your age,

242
00:10:19,162 --> 00:10:22,020
I had to come to this
very same police station

243
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:24,332
all by myself too.

244
00:10:24,334 --> 00:10:27,117
- It's kind of scary in here.
- I'm not scared.

245
00:10:27,119 --> 00:10:30,987
Well, I was. I'm scared all the time.

246
00:10:30,989 --> 00:10:34,675
In fact, once, there
was this really bad guy

247
00:10:34,677 --> 00:10:37,920
and he wanted to hurt a whole
lot of people on a plane.

248
00:10:37,922 --> 00:10:40,038
A meta?

249
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,040
But I helped stop him.

250
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:44,760
- Whoa, really?
- I was terrified, though.

251
00:10:44,762 --> 00:10:46,712
But you know what my secret is?

252
00:10:46,714 --> 00:10:50,358
I just imagine what will
happen after I do the thing.

253
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,720
Do you want to try it?

254
00:10:52,723 --> 00:10:56,105
Okay, close your eyes,

255
00:10:56,107 --> 00:11:00,016
and think about what will
happen once you're out of here.

256
00:11:00,018 --> 00:11:02,561
I'll see Uncle Orlin.

257
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:07,899
Let's find our way out of here, okay?

258
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:11,796
So I can't use "Gazette"? "Chronicle"?

259
00:11:13,624 --> 00:11:16,241
So the only name that's cleared
is "Central City Citizen."

260
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:20,819
Uh, yeah, yeah, thanks.

261
00:11:20,822 --> 00:11:23,936
Hey, who was that on the phone?

262
00:11:23,939 --> 00:11:27,084
Um, a lawyer, she was
helping answer some questions

263
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:29,588
about me starting a newspaper.

264
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,467
That's cool. What'd she say?

265
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:33,378
You know, it doesn't matter.

266
00:11:33,381 --> 00:11:35,724
I-I'm actually not sure
that the timing is right,

267
00:11:35,727 --> 00:11:37,763
and I really just want
to focus on team Flash

268
00:11:37,765 --> 00:11:39,765
and stopping Cicada.

269
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:41,767
Yeah, but...

270
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:43,411
Oh, hold on.

271
00:11:43,413 --> 00:11:44,768
Hey.

272
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:46,500
Slow down, slow down.

273
00:11:46,503 --> 00:11:48,486
It's Sherloque.

274
00:11:48,496 --> 00:11:50,900
Nora did what?

275
00:11:50,903 --> 00:11:52,828
Why would Nora go in alone?

276
00:11:52,831 --> 00:11:54,422
And why isn't she out yet?

277
00:11:54,424 --> 00:11:56,665
My working theory is that
Grace's unique brain damage

278
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:58,450
has caused her brain to act defensively,

279
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:00,118
so when it sensed an outside presence,

280
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,952
it moved all of its
neural nexus pathways

281
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:05,174
to seal the exits like
a-a quarantine procedure.

282
00:12:05,176 --> 00:12:07,147
Grace's brain thinks Nora's a pathogen.

283
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:10,000
Yes, we can expect its
synaptic defense mechanisms

284
00:12:10,003 --> 00:12:12,733
to try and eliminate her.

285
00:12:12,736 --> 00:12:14,515
Remember I told you
about the Mad Hatter?

286
00:12:14,518 --> 00:12:17,260
He was also brain damaged,
so after my dispute with

287
00:12:17,262 --> 00:12:19,930
Watsune and my fourth wife,
Watsune pursued the case

288
00:12:19,932 --> 00:12:22,027
on his own until the day I found him

289
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:25,835
hooked up to the Machine
à Mémoire brain-dead.

290
00:12:25,838 --> 00:12:27,303
You knew this was a possibility?

291
00:12:27,306 --> 00:12:28,772
What happened to easy peasy?

292
00:12:28,774 --> 00:12:32,442
That's why I say go in in pairs.

293
00:12:32,444 --> 00:12:34,277
Barry, we have to go in after her.

294
00:12:38,492 --> 00:12:41,010
I looked all over CCPD.

295
00:12:41,013 --> 00:12:42,754
There's no sign of the portal.

296
00:12:42,757 --> 00:12:44,545
How could you have looked everywhere?

297
00:12:44,548 --> 00:12:46,665
You were gone for about two seconds.

298
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:48,458
Well, I'm really fast.

299
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:51,294
I-I used to run track in high school.

300
00:12:51,296 --> 00:12:53,505
Go CC Squirrels.

301
00:12:53,507 --> 00:12:56,086
Look, Grace, is there
anywhere else you can take me?

302
00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:59,320
Another memory?

303
00:13:09,398 --> 00:13:11,147
Where are we?

304
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:13,751
My house.

305
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,994
Uncle Orlin!

306
00:13:23,996 --> 00:13:25,996
Hey!

307
00:13:25,998 --> 00:13:28,757
Aww. Hey, kiddo.

308
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:30,833
How you doing? How was your day?

309
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,478
Let me run through this again.

310
00:13:33,481 --> 00:13:39,884
So Mr. Truck, you said.
You've seen Cicada here?

311
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:42,554
Dude's been up in here
like a mean fungus.

312
00:13:42,556 --> 00:13:46,182
I see, and how is the
White Russian Hacker?

313
00:13:46,184 --> 00:13:48,226
You wanna focus up here?

314
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:52,108
So can you tell me was he violent?

315
00:13:52,111 --> 00:13:54,282
Hell yeah, every Thursday,

316
00:13:54,285 --> 00:13:57,545
comes in and assaults anyone in here

317
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:04,033
Unnecessary.

318
00:14:04,036 --> 00:14:06,369
But okay.

319
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:12,467
♪ Running, screaming ♪

320
00:14:12,469 --> 00:14:17,297

00:14:17,299 --> 00:14:21,051
♪ Take me up, terror ♪

322
00:14:26,482 --> 00:14:30,651
You're talking about
a band named "Sickada"?

323
00:14:30,654 --> 00:14:31,995
Yeah, bro.

324
00:14:31,998 --> 00:14:34,239
You said "that dude" assaulted people.

325
00:14:34,242 --> 00:14:37,201
He assaults everyone in here
with that terrible music.

326
00:14:37,204 --> 00:14:38,452
Dibs.

327
00:14:38,455 --> 00:14:40,247
Well, that didn't pan
out the way that I hoped.

328
00:14:40,249 --> 00:14:41,904
We will have two Mother-In-Laws, please.

329
00:14:41,907 --> 00:14:44,407
No, no, no, no. Truck,
thank you for your time.

330
00:14:44,409 --> 00:14:46,093
- I think we're done here.
- One drink.

331
00:14:46,095 --> 00:14:48,762
I'm paying.

332
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:50,672
One drink, but only because

333
00:14:50,674 --> 00:14:53,083
you never pay for anything
ever and I'm really curious

334
00:14:53,085 --> 00:14:55,811
to see what hell looks like frozen over.

335
00:14:57,568 --> 00:14:59,463
We can't warn her we're coming?

336
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:01,496
We wanted to install
an emergency beacon,

337
00:15:01,499 --> 00:15:02,860
but it didn't work.

338
00:15:02,862 --> 00:15:05,195
So once you enter, it'll
create a new portal.

339
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:08,098
You'll only have a few
moments to find Grace and Nora

340
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,943
before Grace's brain
tries to seal it off.

341
00:15:10,945 --> 00:15:13,770
Remember, if you die in there...

342
00:15:13,772 --> 00:15:18,533
We die out here. I remember from DeVoe.

343
00:15:18,535 --> 00:15:21,703
We're gonna save her, I promise.

344
00:15:21,705 --> 00:15:24,632
Commencing brainwave transmission.

345
00:15:26,302 --> 00:15:28,410
Good luck.

346
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,835
CCPD.

347
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:45,486
All right, come on.

348
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:50,306
We found her hiding in the
last car under the seat.

349
00:15:50,308 --> 00:15:52,183
- And her parents?
- No idea.

350
00:15:52,185 --> 00:15:54,019
She was on the Red Line headed downtown.

351
00:15:54,021 --> 00:15:56,238
Must've jumped the
turnstile at Fourth and Waid.

352
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,545
We can't just let her
sleep on this bench.

353
00:15:59,548 --> 00:16:01,985
Oh, my God. Barry.

354
00:16:01,987 --> 00:16:05,005
Wait, is that Joe West's granddaughter?

355
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:07,323
Nora? Hey, Nora.

356
00:16:07,325 --> 00:16:09,259
Someone get her.

357
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:11,563
I don't think we're in Grace's memories.

358
00:16:11,566 --> 00:16:12,996
We're in Nora's.

359
00:16:19,614 --> 00:16:22,219
There's been no changes
in Grace's brain activity.

360
00:16:22,222 --> 00:16:23,564
But look.

361
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:25,517
Nora's brain activity has tripled.

362
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,978
That means...

363
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:30,291
Barry and Iris are in Nora's memories.

364
00:16:30,293 --> 00:16:33,193
How did we end up in
Nora's childhood memories?

365
00:16:33,196 --> 00:16:34,935
I have no idea. I also have no clue

366
00:16:34,938 --> 00:16:38,681
how we're gonna rescue Nora from here.

367
00:16:38,684 --> 00:16:42,752
Okay. Okay, we're in a
memory within a memory, right?

368
00:16:42,755 --> 00:16:45,472
- Yeah.
- So if we went through a portal, then...

369
00:16:45,474 --> 00:16:48,525
It should take us into Grace.

370
00:16:48,527 --> 00:16:51,269
Okay, yeah, we just have to
wander through Nora's memories

371
00:16:51,271 --> 00:16:53,196
until we find where the portal went.

372
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:55,991
Okay.

373
00:16:55,993 --> 00:16:57,787
Maybe she'll lead us right there.

374
00:17:00,989 --> 00:17:03,364
Whoa.

375
00:17:03,366 --> 00:17:04,875
What happened here?

376
00:17:04,877 --> 00:17:08,104
I guess in Nora's future,
S.T.A.R. Labs is...

377
00:17:08,107 --> 00:17:10,288
- The Flash Museum.
- The Flash Museum.

378
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:14,334
No way.

379
00:17:14,336 --> 00:17:16,127
Look at this.

380
00:17:16,129 --> 00:17:20,131
Flash toys and Flash phones.

381
00:17:20,133 --> 00:17:24,807
Flash rings. Are you kidding? Wow.

382
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,822
This is all gonna go
to your head, isn't it?

383
00:17:26,825 --> 00:17:29,516
Oh, you know what? It
looks like it might.

384
00:17:29,518 --> 00:17:31,309
Oh, that is very cute.

385
00:17:34,281 --> 00:17:36,481
Hey, I found her.

386
00:17:38,461 --> 00:17:40,818
You think we can talk to her?

387
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,079
No. I wish.

388
00:17:43,081 --> 00:17:47,242
This might be the only time
I get to see her at this age.

389
00:17:47,244 --> 00:17:49,035
Nora's consciousness isn't here, though.

390
00:17:49,037 --> 00:17:50,754
It's in Grace. This is a fixed memory.

391
00:17:50,757 --> 00:17:52,589
We can't interfere.

392
00:17:55,502 --> 00:17:58,428
When I was ten, I wasn't
running away from home.

393
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:00,046
That's 'cause you were a good kid.

394
00:18:00,048 --> 00:18:01,463
I ran away all the time.

395
00:18:01,466 --> 00:18:04,426
Yeah, only 'cause you were
trying to see your dad.

396
00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:07,197
Not 'cause you were
running from someone.

397
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:15,353
Oh, hey, we should keep
trying to find the portal.

398
00:18:19,952 --> 00:18:22,057
Come on, Gracie, no cussing.

399
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,361
Please, can we, please?

400
00:18:24,364 --> 00:18:26,406
Okay, fine.

401
00:18:26,408 --> 00:18:29,833
A rare, old bird is a pelican
whose beak can hold more

402
00:18:29,836 --> 00:18:31,139
than his belly can.

403
00:18:31,142 --> 00:18:34,539
He can hold in his beak
enough food for a week.

404
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:37,681
But I'm darned if I
know how the hell he can.

405
00:18:39,977 --> 00:18:41,920
Grace, I was thinking
maybe we could go now

406
00:18:41,923 --> 00:18:45,147
and look for the portal?

407
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,643
Is something burning?

408
00:18:46,645 --> 00:18:48,136
Oh, crap.

409
00:18:48,138 --> 00:18:50,888
I mean, crud.

410
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,852
He thinks he takes care of me now,

411
00:18:52,855 --> 00:18:54,934
but I really take care of him.

412
00:18:57,915 --> 00:19:00,415
Okay, kiddo, you better eat up.

413
00:19:00,417 --> 00:19:02,251
We've got a big day.

414
00:19:02,253 --> 00:19:03,660
This is...

415
00:19:03,662 --> 00:19:06,454
First we're going to the zoo...

416
00:19:06,456 --> 00:19:08,540
This is an interesting doll house.

417
00:19:08,542 --> 00:19:10,458
We're gonna get ice cream, and then...

418
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,377
Can't forget the fair.

419
00:19:12,379 --> 00:19:14,320
Fair?

420
00:19:14,323 --> 00:19:16,239
Where you got hurt.

421
00:19:16,242 --> 00:19:18,632
Grace, I-I think that's
where the portal is.

422
00:19:18,635 --> 00:19:19,917
Can you take me there?

423
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,179
To the last place that you remember?

424
00:19:23,181 --> 00:19:26,049
Okay.

425
00:19:28,186 --> 00:19:30,186
Hey, check her out.

426
00:19:30,188 --> 00:19:32,764
She's right up your alley.
You should buy her a drink.

427
00:19:32,766 --> 00:19:35,358
Damn. Look at that hand stitching.

428
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,937
No, no, I did not come
here to admire jackets.

429
00:19:39,939 --> 00:19:42,690
I came here to vibe and inform.

430
00:19:42,692 --> 00:19:44,406
Is it just me or are there a lot

431
00:19:44,409 --> 00:19:46,944
of ladies in leather in here?

432
00:19:46,946 --> 00:19:49,197
Yep, singles night.

433
00:19:49,199 --> 00:19:53,660
- It's quite a coincidence.
- Is it?

434
00:19:53,662 --> 00:19:55,662
What is it you're always saying?

435
00:19:55,664 --> 00:19:59,382
- "I smell a mystery"?
- That is trademarked.

436
00:19:59,384 --> 00:20:02,052
I can vibe the anxiety
coming off of you right now.

437
00:20:02,054 --> 00:20:04,295
This whole thing was a setup.

438
00:20:04,297 --> 00:20:07,722
Of course your informant
didn't know Cicada.

439
00:20:07,725 --> 00:20:09,484
I mean, he knew of Cicada.

440
00:20:09,486 --> 00:20:12,481
You lied to me, you wasted my time

441
00:20:12,484 --> 00:20:14,397
so I could be your wingman tonight?

442
00:20:14,399 --> 00:20:16,232
No, no, no, dude, it's not like that.

443
00:20:16,234 --> 00:20:18,685
You know, just when I
think you're growing up,

444
00:20:18,687 --> 00:20:20,311
you go ahead and do
something that shows me

445
00:20:20,313 --> 00:20:22,331
you're just as selfish
as the day we met.

446
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,333
That's for the drinks.

447
00:20:24,335 --> 00:20:26,376
Excuse me.

448
00:20:29,197 --> 00:20:30,547
Wait.

449
00:20:32,991 --> 00:20:35,534
These guys get their own wing?

450
00:20:35,537 --> 00:20:38,180
Who is Cicada? Officials believe...

451
00:20:38,182 --> 00:20:40,273
Barry, maybe we should
keep looking for the portal.

452
00:20:40,276 --> 00:20:41,458
Yeah.

453
00:20:41,461 --> 00:20:44,146
But when Cicada resurfaced in 2024

454
00:20:44,149 --> 00:20:47,020
after the Flash vanished,
some were left to speculate

455
00:20:47,023 --> 00:20:49,325
that Cicada is not a man at all,

456
00:20:49,328 --> 00:20:51,453
but an immortal monster.

457
00:20:51,456 --> 00:20:54,554
All we know for sure is his body count,

458
00:20:54,556 --> 00:20:57,451
152 victims and rising.

459
00:20:57,454 --> 00:20:59,826
Wait, what?

460
00:20:59,828 --> 00:21:03,446
I knew we never caught Cicada,
but he never stops killing?

461
00:21:03,448 --> 00:21:06,190
Flash did everything he could,

462
00:21:06,192 --> 00:21:08,860
but Cicada killed more people than Zoom

463
00:21:08,862 --> 00:21:11,121
or even the Red Death.

464
00:21:11,123 --> 00:21:16,385
And the way the city saw
the Flash, his legacy...

465
00:21:16,387 --> 00:21:19,746
it was never the same.

466
00:21:19,749 --> 00:21:23,600
Nora West-Allen, you are in
serious trouble, young lady.

467
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,263
Grace, what are we doing here?

468
00:21:28,265 --> 00:21:30,140
You wanted to go to my last memory.

469
00:21:30,142 --> 00:21:32,809
Yeah, but I thought that was
supposed to be at the fair.

470
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,572
Grace?

471
00:21:37,574 --> 00:21:39,213
Hello?

472
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:42,318
The destructive phenomenon
emanated from a satellite

473
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,256
that had fallen into a decaying orbit.

474
00:21:45,259 --> 00:21:46,939
Thankfully, before the satellite

475
00:21:46,941 --> 00:21:49,442
could strike the city...

476
00:21:49,444 --> 00:21:51,110
How does she remember this?

477
00:21:51,112 --> 00:21:52,622
A catastrophic event...

478
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:55,381
A new meta was last seen
jumping off a building

479
00:21:55,384 --> 00:21:57,241
in order to evade capture after...

480
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:02,914
I'm gonna make this right, Gracie.

481
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:07,177
Every meta will die.

482
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,630
Grace, how did you
hear Orlin that night?

483
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:17,225
- You were in a coma.
- I know.

484
00:22:17,228 --> 00:22:19,154
But I've been listening.

485
00:22:22,143 --> 00:22:24,936
- You have to stop.
- Not until I'm finished.

486
00:22:24,938 --> 00:22:26,288
Did they come after you tonight?

487
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:29,315
I killed his partner, Vibe,

488
00:22:29,317 --> 00:22:31,275
but there was a woman there too,

489
00:22:31,277 --> 00:22:33,277
banged me up pretty bad.

490
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:35,571
She had speed.

491
00:22:35,573 --> 00:22:38,550
I think she's the Flash's daughter.

492
00:22:40,757 --> 00:22:43,692
Grace, I don't know what
you think Orlin said...

493
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,714
You said you looked everywhere.

494
00:22:45,717 --> 00:22:48,551
I get it now. You have speed.

495
00:22:48,553 --> 00:22:50,479
You're her, aren't you?

496
00:22:50,481 --> 00:22:52,338
You're the Flash's daughter.

497
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,841
You're the one who hurt my uncle.

498
00:23:00,502 --> 00:23:02,286
Grace, I want to help you.

499
00:23:03,436 --> 00:23:06,387
No, you don't. Uncle
Orlin told me about you.

500
00:23:06,389 --> 00:23:08,606
You and your dad are trying to hurt him.

501
00:23:08,608 --> 00:23:10,934
Only because he's trying
to hurt other people,

502
00:23:10,937 --> 00:23:12,393
innocent people!

503
00:23:12,395 --> 00:23:15,538
No, he only hurts metas,

504
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,707
like the one who killed my parents.

505
00:23:17,709 --> 00:23:21,002
Like you! You're a meta and a liar!

506
00:23:21,004 --> 00:23:22,453
All metas aren't bad.

507
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:27,741
My uncle is a hero. He protects people,

508
00:23:27,743 --> 00:23:30,220
and I protect my uncle!

509
00:23:33,132 --> 00:23:35,967
My speed's gone.

510
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,949
Did you think that you could run away

511
00:23:46,952 --> 00:23:48,262
and I wouldn't figure
out where you went?

512
00:23:48,264 --> 00:23:49,814
It's my job to find out the truth.

513
00:23:49,816 --> 00:23:51,844
- I'm a reporter.
- You're always a reporter.

514
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,576
Why not be my mom for once?

515
00:23:53,578 --> 00:23:55,686
Oh, yeah? How's this for being your mom?

516
00:23:55,688 --> 00:23:57,071
You are never coming
back to this place again.

517
00:23:57,073 --> 00:23:58,814
Let's go.

518
00:23:58,816 --> 00:24:00,858
Excuse me, what is in your pocket?

519
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,776
- Hand that over right now.
- It's not yours.

520
00:24:02,778 --> 00:24:05,432
Well, it is now. There are
consequences to your actions.

521
00:24:05,435 --> 00:24:07,325
Hand it over.

522
00:24:10,786 --> 00:24:12,286
I hate you.

523
00:24:13,841 --> 00:24:16,414
Leave it. Let's go.

524
00:24:19,387 --> 00:24:22,630
Iris, that wasn't you.

525
00:24:24,925 --> 00:24:28,686
Yeah, but it will be, Barry.

526
00:24:28,688 --> 00:24:30,446
Nora's gonna grow up hating her mother.

527
00:24:30,448 --> 00:24:32,690
No, she won't. You're gonna
make different choices.

528
00:24:32,692 --> 00:24:34,808
If you don't wanna be that
person that we just saw,

529
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:36,128
- don't be that person.
- I know.

530
00:24:36,131 --> 00:24:37,465
I know you keep saying that, Barry,

531
00:24:37,467 --> 00:24:39,163
and that's what I'm trying to do.

532
00:24:39,165 --> 00:24:41,106
I had a moment today and I thought that

533
00:24:41,108 --> 00:24:43,150
maybe if I could
change the timeline now,

534
00:24:43,152 --> 00:24:44,774
that even in the smallest way

535
00:24:44,777 --> 00:24:46,296
that... I don't know.

536
00:24:46,298 --> 00:24:49,490
That everything in the future
would be somehow different.

537
00:24:49,492 --> 00:24:52,524
This is why you changed your
mind about the newspaper.

538
00:24:52,527 --> 00:24:54,319
When I talked to the lawyer,

539
00:24:54,322 --> 00:24:57,881
I asked her to check a
dozen potential names,

540
00:24:57,884 --> 00:25:00,217
and guess which one was
the only one that cleared.

541
00:25:00,219 --> 00:25:02,159
The "Central City Citizen."

542
00:25:02,162 --> 00:25:04,388
I know it's got baggage,
but it's just a name.

543
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:06,891
Is it? I mean, we've been
looking at that front page

544
00:25:06,893 --> 00:25:08,318
for four years.

545
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,821
"Flash Missing, Vanishes in Crisis."

546
00:25:11,823 --> 00:25:15,015
And I'm the one that
writes that article, Barry.

547
00:25:15,017 --> 00:25:16,392
I just thought that, I don't know,

548
00:25:16,394 --> 00:25:17,833
maybe if I don't start
the paper, that...

549
00:25:17,835 --> 00:25:19,162
Iris, this is your dream,

550
00:25:19,164 --> 00:25:21,355
and the city needs somebody like you.

551
00:25:21,357 --> 00:25:23,241
Yeah, but, Barry, look where it gets us.

552
00:25:23,244 --> 00:25:26,078
These are Nora's memories
right now in this timeline

553
00:25:26,081 --> 00:25:28,195
after she interfered.

554
00:25:30,175 --> 00:25:33,158
Let's keep looking for the portal, okay?

555
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,136
Nora needs our help.

556
00:25:50,862 --> 00:25:52,720
I'll have whatever he's having.

557
00:25:52,722 --> 00:25:55,222
All I want to order right
now is a Lyft out of here,

558
00:25:55,224 --> 00:25:57,766
but I get no bars in this bar,

559
00:25:57,769 --> 00:26:00,018
so maybe I'll just have to
leave the old-fashioned way

560
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,353
and breach on out of here.

561
00:26:01,355 --> 00:26:03,790
Look, Cisco, I'm...

562
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,692
Sorry I lied to you.

563
00:26:07,695 --> 00:26:09,120
Don't apologize to me.

564
00:26:09,122 --> 00:26:10,788
Apologize to all the
meta-humans out there

565
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,548
still waiting for a cure,

566
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:15,960
for their right to choose if
they want these powers or not.

567
00:26:15,962 --> 00:26:18,221
Before I was The Elongated Man,

568
00:26:18,223 --> 00:26:21,966
when I was just nobody Ralph Dibny,

569
00:26:21,968 --> 00:26:24,529
I could do whatever I
wanted whenever I wanted,

570
00:26:24,532 --> 00:26:27,921
but I didn't have any friends
to do those things with.

571
00:26:29,475 --> 00:26:32,251
So I just thought if, uh,
we're getting a night off

572
00:26:32,254 --> 00:26:34,887
from stopping Cicada, we could just

573
00:26:34,889 --> 00:26:37,431
go out and...

574
00:26:37,433 --> 00:26:39,057
have some fun, you know?

575
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:41,268
And I want that too,

576
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:44,897
but after we figure out this cure.

577
00:26:46,584 --> 00:26:48,418
You know, my mom's friend Doug,

578
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,277
he had a saying.

579
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:52,112
"If you're always
waiting to live your life,

580
00:26:52,114 --> 00:26:53,664
you're gonna die before it starts."

581
00:26:53,666 --> 00:26:58,335
And Doug, he would know.
He operated a zamboni.

582
00:26:58,337 --> 00:27:00,096
May he rest in peace.

583
00:27:00,098 --> 00:27:01,872
All right, I'ma go outside,

584
00:27:01,874 --> 00:27:03,182
see if I can stretch my arm high enough

585
00:27:03,184 --> 00:27:06,102
to get you some cell phone service.

586
00:27:10,591 --> 00:27:13,726
Dark and Stormy on the house.

587
00:27:13,728 --> 00:27:15,394
Do I look that pathetic?

588
00:27:15,397 --> 00:27:17,804
You look like you belong
here about as much as I do.

589
00:27:17,807 --> 00:27:20,087
Thought I was coming here
for a business meeting.

590
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:22,248
What do you do, sell leather?

591
00:27:22,251 --> 00:27:24,144
- Nope.
- Tattoo artist.

592
00:27:24,146 --> 00:27:26,237
- Mm-mm.
- Gun for hire.

593
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,358
Trust me.

594
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,158
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

595
00:27:31,161 --> 00:27:32,469
Well, I'm a photographer,

596
00:27:32,472 --> 00:27:34,914
so it looks like we're
both a little lost.

597
00:27:34,917 --> 00:27:36,465
So what's your excuse?

598
00:27:36,468 --> 00:27:39,043
Taking pictures hasn't
made me rich, yet,

599
00:27:39,045 --> 00:27:40,878
so I bartend to pay rent.

600
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,305
My sister hooked me up here.

601
00:27:42,307 --> 00:27:44,474
Forgot to mention I'd
be working in hell.

602
00:27:46,219 --> 00:27:48,460
Sisters.

603
00:27:48,462 --> 00:27:51,726
If I looked at the DNA of two siblings,

604
00:27:51,729 --> 00:27:53,932
one who became a meta
and one who didn't,

605
00:27:53,935 --> 00:27:56,134
I would have a close
enough genetic match

606
00:27:56,136 --> 00:27:57,561
to isolate the part of the genome

607
00:27:57,563 --> 00:27:59,471
that controls meta-genes.

608
00:28:00,885 --> 00:28:03,158
I'm sorry, did I just say that out loud?

609
00:28:03,161 --> 00:28:05,269
Yeah, you did.

610
00:28:05,271 --> 00:28:09,106
I-I just... that... I...

611
00:28:09,108 --> 00:28:10,979
- Cisco.
- Camilla.

612
00:28:10,982 --> 00:28:13,835
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

613
00:28:13,838 --> 00:28:15,654
I can't find the portal anywhere.

614
00:28:15,656 --> 00:28:19,509
I can't even get out of Nora's
memories of this one day.

615
00:28:19,511 --> 00:28:21,076
Barry, get down!

616
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:37,475
Nora's in trouble.
Grace's defense mechanisms

617
00:28:37,478 --> 00:28:38,886
must be attacking her.

618
00:28:38,888 --> 00:28:40,607
She's not the only one who's in trouble.

619
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:42,198
We need to get them out of there now.

620
00:28:43,715 --> 00:28:45,886
It's Nora's defense mechanism.

621
00:28:59,693 --> 00:29:02,310
What am I supposed to do now?

622
00:29:10,536 --> 00:29:11,869
Hello?

623
00:29:11,872 --> 00:29:13,922
- Nora, is that you?
- Caitlyn!

624
00:29:13,924 --> 00:29:15,435
Yes, I told you the M.A.D. 2.0

625
00:29:15,438 --> 00:29:17,055
could complete your emergency beacon.

626
00:29:17,058 --> 00:29:19,211
Uh, Nora, your parents
went into your memories.

627
00:29:19,214 --> 00:29:20,745
Uh, let me conference them in.

628
00:29:20,747 --> 00:29:23,456
Sorry, my parents went where?

629
00:29:39,349 --> 00:29:41,399
- Iris West-Allan.
- Mom? Dad?

630
00:29:41,401 --> 00:29:42,903
- Nora, are you okay?
- So listen.

631
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:45,308
- We made an important discovery.
- To get you out of there.

632
00:29:45,311 --> 00:29:48,671
The portals are hidden
in perception gaps.

633
00:29:48,674 --> 00:29:50,790
Things that you remember
the way you want them to be,

634
00:29:50,793 --> 00:29:52,151
not the way they actually were.

635
00:29:52,153 --> 00:29:53,890
'Cause you're in denial
or your perception

636
00:29:53,893 --> 00:29:55,572
was colored by anger or what have you.

637
00:29:55,574 --> 00:29:58,008
So these defense mechanisms,
they're composed of synapses.

638
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:00,752
If you can break down the
synapses in the false memory,

639
00:30:00,754 --> 00:30:02,408
that will reveal the real memory

640
00:30:02,411 --> 00:30:04,764
and the synaptic jolt
will expose the portal.

641
00:30:04,767 --> 00:30:08,001
Okay, so... okay,
well, how do we do that?

642
00:30:08,003 --> 00:30:10,587
Well, uh, we'll have to call you back.

643
00:30:10,589 --> 00:30:11,688
You're burning up.

644
00:30:13,216 --> 00:30:14,233
Hello?

645
00:30:19,698 --> 00:30:21,740
Perception gaps.

646
00:30:25,395 --> 00:30:26,692
The dollhouse.

647
00:30:28,239 --> 00:30:31,782
How do we know which
memories weren't real?

648
00:30:31,785 --> 00:30:35,067
Of course... Iris, it's
the Hall of Villains.

649
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,288
You and Nora.

650
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:38,698
Barry, I still dampen Nora's power.

651
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,458
She still grows up hating me.

652
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:43,036
- This is my future.
- No, no, it's not.

653
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:45,301
It's just a memory, one
warped from the perspective

654
00:30:45,304 --> 00:30:47,540
of a sad, angry, little
kid that ran away from home.

655
00:30:47,542 --> 00:30:49,726
Don't you get it? That
person that we saw in there,

656
00:30:49,728 --> 00:30:52,253
the bad mom that Nora told us about,

657
00:30:52,255 --> 00:30:55,180
she doesn't even exist in any timeline.

658
00:30:55,183 --> 00:30:57,401
I told you you had to be
different in the future,

659
00:30:57,404 --> 00:30:58,551
but I was wrong.

660
00:30:58,553 --> 00:31:00,428
You don't have to change who you are.

661
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:03,648
You don't even have to change
the name of your newspaper.

662
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:07,652
I know any future with you
in it is gonna be a good one.

663
00:31:07,654 --> 00:31:11,105
You just gotta believe that too.

664
00:31:13,109 --> 00:31:14,918
What are you doing here?

665
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,236
Please, this memory isn't real.

666
00:31:17,238 --> 00:31:20,740
Your uncle's house, I don't
think it's really like this.

667
00:31:20,742 --> 00:31:22,511
Okay, better eat up, kiddo.

668
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:23,576
We got a big day...

669
00:31:26,492 --> 00:31:27,764
Grace, get down!

670
00:31:38,444 --> 00:31:40,468
I don't see the portal anywhere.

671
00:31:53,066 --> 00:31:54,857
Barry, it's working!

672
00:32:02,867 --> 00:32:04,993
Death. Failure.

673
00:32:04,995 --> 00:32:08,494
Another broken family.

674
00:32:08,497 --> 00:32:12,842
This is the legacy I gave you.

675
00:32:14,585 --> 00:32:17,171
Nobody breaks up my
family, you son of a bitch.

676
00:32:56,346 --> 00:32:58,671
Oh, no.

677
00:33:00,341 --> 00:33:02,383
You dropped your toy.

678
00:33:02,385 --> 00:33:04,528
I just wanted to see the museum.

679
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:05,862
I know, honey, but you ran away.

680
00:33:05,864 --> 00:33:07,181
I didn't know where you went.

681
00:33:07,184 --> 00:33:08,940
I was afraid you could have gotten hurt.

682
00:33:08,942 --> 00:33:11,276
You said that the museum
reminded you of Dad

683
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:14,062
'cause Dad was the
Flash's number one fan.

684
00:33:14,064 --> 00:33:16,614
So I wanted to see it

685
00:33:16,616 --> 00:33:20,777
'cause I love the Flash too.

686
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:22,904
It's not fair.

687
00:33:22,906 --> 00:33:26,324
I know, honey. I know it's not fair.

688
00:33:26,326 --> 00:33:28,282
I love you, Nora.

689
00:33:28,285 --> 00:33:30,553
Your dad loved you too.

690
00:33:30,556 --> 00:33:32,889
So, so much.

691
00:33:35,752 --> 00:33:37,376
Come here, girl.

692
00:33:45,212 --> 00:33:47,529
Come on. We gotta go.

693
00:33:49,983 --> 00:33:51,908
Let's go get Nora.

694
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:55,179
Grace, I know you're afraid.

695
00:33:55,182 --> 00:33:57,465
You think that you'll never
be as happy as you were

696
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:59,082
that day with your uncle.

697
00:33:59,084 --> 00:34:02,110
That's why you try to
remember it as perfect,

698
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:05,613
but things can be that good, Grace.

699
00:34:05,615 --> 00:34:09,426
You just have to wake up.

700
00:34:11,263 --> 00:34:14,422
And then you and me and my parents,

701
00:34:14,424 --> 00:34:17,059
we can all help your uncle together.

702
00:34:18,771 --> 00:34:21,170
You're a liar.

703
00:34:32,725 --> 00:34:34,701
Grace.

704
00:34:34,703 --> 00:34:37,270
Maybe you don't have
anyone who cares about you,

705
00:34:37,272 --> 00:34:40,106
but I have someone who cares about me,

706
00:34:40,108 --> 00:34:43,442
and I'm the only one who can help him.

707
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:51,450
Mom.

708
00:34:51,452 --> 00:34:53,545
- Hey.
- She's not coming.

709
00:34:53,547 --> 00:34:54,997
- What?
- Hurry!

710
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,497
Come on. Come on.

711
00:35:07,135 --> 00:35:09,486
They're okay.

712
00:35:22,339 --> 00:35:23,726
Neural oscillations are normal.

713
00:35:23,729 --> 00:35:25,019
You three are perfectly healthy.

714
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:26,355
Oh, and we think we've figured out

715
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:28,060
how you two ended up in Nora's brain.

716
00:35:28,063 --> 00:35:30,370
That is a satellite shard

717
00:35:30,373 --> 00:35:32,716
full of dark matter in Grace's head.

718
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:34,003
Mon dieu.

719
00:35:34,005 --> 00:35:36,247
Sometimes surgeons
leave a piece of shrapnel

720
00:35:36,249 --> 00:35:38,890
in a patient's brain if
it's too dangerous to remove,

721
00:35:38,893 --> 00:35:41,024
and we think that the
dark matter was seeping out

722
00:35:41,027 --> 00:35:43,116
to create a barrier around her brain.

723
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,513
We can't go back in
as long as it's there.

724
00:35:45,516 --> 00:35:46,605
It's too dangerous.

725
00:35:46,608 --> 00:35:49,109
Well, we need to find
another way to stop Cicada.

726
00:35:49,112 --> 00:35:52,214
I think I might be
able to help with that.

727
00:35:59,105 --> 00:36:00,771
It's the inside of Dwyer's house.

728
00:36:00,774 --> 00:36:01,901
Whoa.

729
00:36:01,904 --> 00:36:03,297
- Damn.
- I mean, that's great.

730
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,807
But why did you go in without us?

731
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:06,125
We had a plan.

732
00:36:06,128 --> 00:36:08,670
No, I know, um...

733
00:36:08,673 --> 00:36:10,999
You know, just with
the machine being ready

734
00:36:11,001 --> 00:36:13,042
and knowing that Cicada
was still out there

735
00:36:13,044 --> 00:36:16,504
I guess I just, um, I
got a little excessive.

736
00:36:16,506 --> 00:36:19,832
It's not the only reason, though, right?

737
00:36:19,834 --> 00:36:22,877
It was protecting her secret.

738
00:36:22,879 --> 00:36:25,105
What secret is that?

739
00:36:35,475 --> 00:36:38,160
Well, her feelings for her
mother when she was a child.

740
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:40,144
Must be painful memories.

741
00:36:42,949 --> 00:36:44,357
Is that correct, Nora?

742
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:46,133
Yeah, exactly.

743
00:36:47,977 --> 00:36:51,238
Okay, um, let's get
started on this lead.

744
00:36:51,241 --> 00:36:52,371
Good job, Nora.

745
00:36:52,374 --> 00:36:53,874
Thanks.

746
00:36:58,206 --> 00:37:02,017
Monsieur Allen, just for my
records of today's events,

747
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:07,505
what was the defense
mechanism Nora was using?

748
00:37:07,507 --> 00:37:10,525
It was one of the
costumes from the museum.

749
00:37:10,527 --> 00:37:12,843
What costume?

750
00:37:12,845 --> 00:37:14,863
The Reverse Flash.

751
00:37:32,824 --> 00:37:34,457
Surprise!

752
00:37:34,459 --> 00:37:36,626
Happy first day in your new office.

753
00:37:36,628 --> 00:37:37,802
You're so sweet.

754
00:37:39,664 --> 00:37:42,039
So have you decided what
you're gonna name the paper?

755
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:43,498
I don't know.

756
00:37:43,501 --> 00:37:46,393
"Central City Citizen"
has a certain ring to it.

757
00:37:46,396 --> 00:37:49,714
- You sure?
- Yeah, you were right.

758
00:37:49,716 --> 00:37:51,733
Future isn't always what it seems.

759
00:37:51,735 --> 00:37:53,477
We decide what it gets to be.

760
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:57,888
So, um, I just have to
tell you one little thing.

761
00:37:57,890 --> 00:37:59,932
See that ledger down there?

762
00:37:59,934 --> 00:38:02,768
That's the year the paper
was founded in my time.

763
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:04,520
2021.

764
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:07,198
That's two years from now.

765
00:38:08,299 --> 00:38:10,609
You're changing the future already.

766
00:38:12,405 --> 00:38:15,465
Hey, um, I gotta find Cisco,

767
00:38:15,467 --> 00:38:17,366
but I'll see you guys later, all right?

768
00:38:17,368 --> 00:38:18,909
Okay.

769
00:38:20,788 --> 00:38:22,514
Let's head back.

770
00:38:24,767 --> 00:38:26,529
- Mom?
- Yeah?

771
00:38:26,532 --> 00:38:30,847
Dad told me about the
memory that you saw.

772
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:34,300
I know it wasn't real, Nora,

773
00:38:34,302 --> 00:38:37,112
but it must have come
from a very real place.

774
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:40,806
You must have been so angry
with me to see me that way.

775
00:38:40,808 --> 00:38:43,809
I was angry all the time.

776
00:38:43,811 --> 00:38:46,362
Angry for not getting to have a dad,

777
00:38:46,364 --> 00:38:51,567
angry 'cause nobody seemed to
understand what I was feeling.

778
00:38:51,569 --> 00:38:54,537
And it didn't matter
what you did or said, Mom.

779
00:38:54,539 --> 00:38:57,355
I was always gonna be angry at you...

780
00:38:57,358 --> 00:39:00,067
because you were there.

781
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:02,378
You're going through a lot, Nora.

782
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,227
But so were you.

783
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:05,882
I mean, I thought you were trying

784
00:39:05,884 --> 00:39:07,104
to stop me from being me,

785
00:39:07,107 --> 00:39:10,126
but you were trying to
stop me from being Dad.

786
00:39:10,129 --> 00:39:13,631
I mean, ending up like him.

787
00:39:13,633 --> 00:39:16,842
You guys had a whole life together

788
00:39:16,844 --> 00:39:20,322
and a child, and he vanished.

789
00:39:20,324 --> 00:39:25,735
I-I can't imagine how hard
that must have been for you.

790
00:39:25,737 --> 00:39:28,479
And from that day, you...

791
00:39:28,481 --> 00:39:30,981
you were protecting me.

792
00:39:30,983 --> 00:39:34,212
I-I get that now.

793
00:39:34,215 --> 00:39:37,172
So sorry for the way that I treated you,

794
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:42,251
both back then and now
when I first got here.

795
00:39:42,253 --> 00:39:43,828
You didn't deserve that.

796
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:49,542
Thank you.

797
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:56,215
You're an amazing woman, Nora West-Allen.

798
00:39:56,217 --> 00:39:58,884
I will always love you,

799
00:39:58,886 --> 00:40:00,678
past, present, and future.

800
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,198
I love you too, Mom.

801
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,867
It's hard to keep a secret,
but it's a lot easier

802
00:40:05,869 --> 00:40:07,810
when you're reminded
why you're doing it.

803
00:40:07,812 --> 00:40:09,430
- Ready?
- Yeah.

804
00:40:09,433 --> 00:40:12,355
I met someone who told me
that she would do anything

805
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:14,913
to protect her family.

806
00:40:14,916 --> 00:40:20,837
She helped me see that... so would I.

807
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:25,053
My parents can't know that
you're helping me stop Cicada.

808
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:27,463
There's too much at risk.

809
00:40:27,465 --> 00:40:31,792
And I'll do anything to protect them.

810
00:40:31,794 --> 00:40:34,137
Even lie.

811
00:40:38,977 --> 00:40:40,558
Liar.

812
00:40:40,654 --> 00:40:42,237
Liar.

813
00:40:42,305 --> 00:40:45,714
Liar. Liar.

814
00:40:45,725 --> 00:40:48,225
Nora lied to me.

815
00:40:49,913 --> 00:40:51,320
She'll pay.

816
00:40:53,158 --> 00:40:55,065
They'll all pay.

817
00:41:00,465 --> 00:41:02,424
Doug was right.

818
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:04,730
Going out there, doing
the ice skating thing,

819
00:41:04,733 --> 00:41:06,952
that was definitely
the right thing to do.

820
00:41:06,954 --> 00:41:09,896
Yeah, all Doug, may he rest in peace.

821
00:41:09,899 --> 00:41:11,766
Let's pour one out for the guy.

822
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,553
Camilla? The bartender?

823
00:41:13,556 --> 00:41:16,557
- Uh, excuse me.
- Dude, nice.

824
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,464
- All right, all right.
- Yeah.

825
00:41:18,466 --> 00:41:20,140
Hey, did you guys make a breakthrough

826
00:41:20,143 --> 00:41:21,601
with the meta-human cure?

827
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:24,310
We did. I managed to locate

828
00:41:24,313 --> 00:41:26,331
a pair of meta-non-meta siblings,

829
00:41:26,334 --> 00:41:29,491
so this cure, it's as good as done.

830
00:41:29,494 --> 00:41:32,361
All right, good, because
I've been thinking.

831
00:41:34,407 --> 00:41:36,219
I want to use the cure on Cicada.

832
00:41:36,222 --> 00:41:39,004
