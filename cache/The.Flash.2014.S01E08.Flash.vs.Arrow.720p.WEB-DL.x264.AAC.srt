00:00:01,233 --> 00:00:06,005
My name is Barry Allen,
and I'm the fastest man alive.

3
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:07,706
When I was a child,
I saw my mother

4
00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:09,141
Killed by something impossible.

5
00:00:09,143 --> 00:00:10,442
Run, Barry, run!

6
00:00:10,444 --> 00:00:13,012
My father went to prison
for her murder.

7
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:17,082
Then an accident made me
the impossible.

8
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:18,350
To the outside world,

9
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:19,718
I'm an ordinary
forensic scientist,

10
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,521
But secretly I use my speed
to fight crime

11
00:00:22,523 --> 00:00:24,023
And find others like me,

12
00:00:24,025 --> 00:00:26,692
And one day I'll find
who killed my mother...

13
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:29,361
- Mom.
- And get justice for my father.

14
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,964
I am the Flash.

15
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:34,733
Previously, on<i> the Flash</i>
<i>and arrow...</i>

16
00:00:34,735 --> 00:00:36,268
I'm just not sure I'm like you,
Oliver.

17
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,038
I don't know
if I can be some vigilante.

18
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,707
You can be better,
because you can inspire people

19
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:43,242
In a way that I never could.

20
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:45,411
You said you were writing
about me to bring hope

21
00:00:45,413 --> 00:00:46,979
To someone you care about.

22
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:49,214
How would he feel if doing that
put you in harm's way?

23
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:51,083
You're giving hope
to a lot of people.

24
00:00:51,085 --> 00:00:52,952
So I'm doing this for them.
Barry, when you met me,

25
00:00:52,954 --> 00:00:56,522
Oliver, and Dig, we were this
well-oiled archery machine,

26
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:58,023
But it didn't
start out that way.

27
00:00:58,025 --> 00:00:59,858
I'm sorry I wasn't there
for you tonight.

28
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,695
You're worth being on time for.

29
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,867
Everyone on this planet,
at some point in their lives,

30
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:11,036
Has had a major case
of the feels...

31
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:13,038
Those days when your heart
is just too small

32
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,443
To hold the big things
you're feeling.

33
00:01:17,445 --> 00:01:20,079
Today's one of those days.

34
00:01:20,081 --> 00:01:23,115
We think of our emotions like
they're these unique,

35
00:01:23,117 --> 00:01:24,950
Personal phenomena,

36
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:28,354
That no one has ever felt
what we have felt.

37
00:01:28,356 --> 00:01:31,924
There is a basis in science
for every emotion we feel...

38
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:33,625
Anger, love.

39
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:36,228
As a scientist,
I know there's nothing magical

40
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:39,498
About what makes us feel
something for someone else...

41
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,701
But then I see her smile.

42
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:45,404
Man, that cannot be science.

43
00:01:45,406 --> 00:01:49,008
♪ Whoo, I want it, whoo ♪

44
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:56,615
Oh, and there's a fresh bottle
in the fridge

45
00:01:56,617 --> 00:01:59,018
When she wakes up from her nap.

46
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,853
Thank you.

47
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:06,091
Sir?
Help you with something?

48
00:02:06,093 --> 00:02:08,560
Thanks.

49
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:10,996
I'll be just fine on my own.

50
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:25,711
Sir, you're not allowed
to be back here.

51
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:27,780
Nothing to get upset about.

52
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:43,095
Barry, bank robbery
in progress

53
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:45,731
- At Cunningham and Sampere.
- I got it.

54
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:47,099
Wait, that's where I bank.

55
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:50,602
Once super thieves showed up,
I went mattress.

56
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:26,138
I've already missed the gym.

57
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,042
Ugh, no.
Five more minutes.

58
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:32,711
Come on,
we never get to sleep in.

59
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:35,881
I know.
But your dad hates tardiness.

60
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:40,119
Buzzkill.

61
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:43,088
The buzziest.

62
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:51,196
Another picture of the Flash
came in.

63
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:52,331
See?

64
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:55,033
That red blur?

65
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:56,435
How do you know that wasn't
photoshopped?

66
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:57,703
It wasn't.

67
00:03:57,705 --> 00:04:01,273
It's not a hoax
or a mass hallucination.

68
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:05,310
You know, every day, someone new
accepts the impossible

69
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:07,346
and believes in him.

70
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:08,947
Why can't you?

71
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:12,384
I believe in what I can see...

72
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:14,586
What I can touch...

73
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:17,589
What I can feel.

74
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,991
- Which means I believe in you.
- Mm.

75
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,200
Do you mind?

76
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,520
Thanks, man.

77
00:04:27,535 --> 00:04:29,701
- Hey.
- Busy morning.

78
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:31,570
Witnesses reported
seeing a red streak?

79
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:33,872
Joe, you should have seen it.
It was like everybody in here

80
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:35,874
Was trying to kill each other.
I got here just in time.

81
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:37,576
Well, it must've
been a diversion,

82
00:04:37,578 --> 00:04:40,212
Because there's 1/2 million
bucks missing from the vault.

83
00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:41,980
There's a tracer
in the cash stacks.

84
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:43,549
We're trying to find the signal.

85
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:47,953
Meantime, any idea what could've
caused such mass...

86
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:50,355
- This?
- A neurotoxin, maybe.

87
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:52,758
I'm going to swab some surfaces,
see what I can find,

88
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,961
But I think maybe
they got whammied.

89
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:59,198
- Did you just say "whammied"?
- I got so angry.

90
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,834
I can't believe I did that.
I would never hurt anybody.

91
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:06,036
- You have to believe me.
- I do.

92
00:05:06,207 --> 00:05:08,106
Something is happening
in this city

93
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:10,108
And everyone wants to pretend
like it isn't, but it is,

94
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,211
And I think we should do
something about it.

95
00:05:12,213 --> 00:05:14,379
My boyfriend has decided
we need to eat healthy at home,

96
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:18,650
So work is now the only place
I can eat what I like.

97
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,920
Oh, I'm sorry, were you saying
something, detective?

98
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:24,222
The blur, the Flash,
the man in the red suit...

99
00:05:24,225 --> 00:05:26,225
Whatever he's called...
he was spotted at the bank

100
00:05:26,227 --> 00:05:28,193
- this morning.
- You mean the bank

101
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:30,229
that was robbed
of 1/2 million dollars,

102
00:05:30,231 --> 00:05:32,464
where a dozen people tried
to murder each other,

103
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:34,416
And you think our attention
should be focused on

104
00:05:34,435 --> 00:05:35,935
catching Santa Claus.

105
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,940
I can't explain how he gets to
and from crime scenes so fast.

106
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,976
We need to figure out who this
guy is and what he wants.

107
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:45,911
You should
ask your girlfriend.

108
00:05:45,913 --> 00:05:49,681
She writes fan fiction
about him.

109
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,317
Joe, help me out here.

110
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,585
Sorry, partner.

111
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:56,521
I stopped believing in Santa
when I was about eight.

112
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,196
Hey.
What's going on in there?

113
00:06:04,198 --> 00:06:06,798
I think Eddie's trying
to convince the Captain

114
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,200
That the Flash
is a public menace.

115
00:06:09,203 --> 00:06:10,703
Excuse me?

116
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:14,606
So after weeks of my trying
to convince you

117
00:06:14,608 --> 00:06:17,508
that the Flash is real, now
that you finally do believe me,

118
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:18,910
you're trying
to have him arrested?

119
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,520
- What the hell?
- Thanks, Barry.

120
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:21,947
Sorry.

121
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:24,983
No worries.
The Captain shot me down.

122
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:26,685
Look, I'm not feeling
like lunch.

123
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:28,287
See you later.

124
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,692
He's just jealous.

125
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:35,527
Of the Flash?

126
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:36,728
Should he be?

127
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,031
No.

128
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:42,167
I'll see you later.

129
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:43,235
Barry,

130
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:45,070
You need to get
to S.T.A.R. Labs.

131
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:48,340
Yeah, I will.
After I eat.

132
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:58,417
Anger, hate, aggression.

133
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:02,054
A Jedi craves not these things.

134
00:07:02,056 --> 00:07:03,655
No one is feeling that quote?

135
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:05,824
Everyone in the bank
went total savage for,

136
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:07,192
Like, five minutes.

137
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:08,493
And then they were fine again.

138
00:07:08,495 --> 00:07:10,629
Anger can be
a powerful emotion.

139
00:07:10,631 --> 00:07:13,265
If this meta-human can engender
irrational feelings of anger

140
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,334
In his victims,
he can do a lot of damage.

141
00:07:15,336 --> 00:07:17,369
Detective west helped get
a copy of the cat scans

142
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:19,671
The hospital did on everyone
at the bank.

143
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:22,107
Take a look.

144
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,408
Well, look at this,

145
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,043
The emotion centers
of the brains

146
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:27,379
Are still showing signs
of being overwhelmed.

147
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:30,515
Particularly the area that
controls executive function.

148
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:32,617
That's the part of the brain
that stops people from doing

149
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:34,653
Whatever random and potentially
destructive thing

150
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,021
That pops into their head.

151
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:37,522
How do you think the meta
does it to them?

152
00:07:37,524 --> 00:07:39,725
That's the 1/2 million dollar
question.

153
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:45,530
Hey, if you guys figure it
out, just give me a call, okay?

154
00:07:45,532 --> 00:07:48,600
Is the Flash off to another
rooftop rendezvous with Iris?

155
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:50,602
No.

156
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:53,872
Yeah, but she probably just
wants to ask me...

157
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:57,075
I mean, you know, him... about
meta-human stuff for her blog.

158
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:58,744
Do you want some advice?

159
00:07:58,746 --> 00:08:00,946
No matter what I say,
I'm getting the advice, right?

160
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:02,147
Don't get involved.

161
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,516
As the Flash or yourself.

162
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:08,186
You don't want to be the one
to blame for their breakup.

163
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:10,389
Okay.
I hear you.

164
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,200
Iris.
Flash.

165
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,838
Be great to call you
by your real name.

166
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,541
You mean like Ralph?

167
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:31,510
Is your name Ralph?

168
00:08:33,446 --> 00:08:36,648
What did you want
to see me about?

169
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,183
My boyfriend, he's...

170
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:39,818
Did you guys break up?

171
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,621
- No.
- Oh.

172
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:47,025
He's a cop and he thinks
that you're dangerous.

173
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:49,327
And he's trying to convince
his boss that you're a menace

174
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:50,996
That needs to be stopped.

175
00:08:50,998 --> 00:08:54,733
I thought I should warn you.

176
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:58,136
Anyways, you should probably go.

177
00:09:01,674 --> 00:09:02,941
You're not going.

178
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:04,276
Barry, are you there?

179
00:09:04,278 --> 00:09:05,677
- What?
- The police got a ping

180
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,479
From the tracer hidden
in the stolen cash.

181
00:09:07,481 --> 00:09:10,115
Swat team's closing in
on the 1600 block of pass.

182
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:13,752
Now stop ruining
Iris' love life and go.

183
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:15,921
I've gotta run.

184
00:09:15,923 --> 00:09:19,224
I bet you say that
to all the girls.

185
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,660
What other girls?

186
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:41,746
He always paid in cash.

187
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,248
- Never seemed like trouble.
- He's on the move.

188
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:49,287
- Freeze!
- Hold it right there!

189
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:53,492
- Hands up.
- Is there a problem, gentlemen?

190
00:09:53,494 --> 00:09:54,693
Certo.

191
00:09:57,563 --> 00:10:00,232
Turn around!

192
00:10:03,402 --> 00:10:06,838
Certo, what are you waiting for?
Cuff him!

193
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,407
You don't tell me what to do.

194
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,477
Get down!

195
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,157
Ugh!
Ah!

196
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:30,729
Nice mask.

197
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:47,579
It's kinda comforting to know
that no matter

198
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:49,514
What city you go to,
Big Belly Burger is always

199
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:52,517
Going to taste
like Big Belly Burger.

200
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:55,253
You mean full of grease
and salt?

201
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,455
I thought those were
the secret ingredients.

202
00:10:58,292 --> 00:11:00,725
Oliver's back.

203
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:05,997
By the way, I gave Oliver,
like, 1/2 hour head start.

204
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:09,034
- Hi, Barry.
- Hey, Felicity.

205
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:11,703
How you doing, Dig?

206
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:13,638
You're fast.

207
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,140
Did you guys not tell him
about me?

208
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:18,109
Seeing is believing, or...

209
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:20,078
drooling.

210
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:31,187
Hey, thanks for showing up
back there, but I had that.

211
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:32,124
Uh-huh.

212
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:34,330
What, I was getting ready
to make my move.

213
00:11:34,338 --> 00:11:35,361
What move?

214
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:36,462
The one to the morgue?

215
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,990
Wait, so what are you guys
doing in Central City?

216
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,500
Working a case.

217
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:44,936
Suspicious homicide in the
styling where the murder weapon

218
00:11:44,938 --> 00:11:46,805
is a boomerang.

219
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:50,842
Cool.

220
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:52,410
I mean, awful.

221
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:54,379
I found traces
of iron oxide on it.

222
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:55,947
I know it's a long shot,
but Central City has

223
00:11:55,949 --> 00:11:58,183
The highest concentration of
iron oxide in the country.

224
00:11:58,185 --> 00:11:59,584
Did you know Australian
aboriginals

225
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:01,252
Use boomerangs to hunt?
Mainly on kangaroo,

226
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:03,355
Which is a surprisingly
low-fat source of prot...

227
00:12:03,357 --> 00:12:05,056
we were following up a lead

228
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,292
When we heard the S.W.A.T. Raid
over the radio, and I thought

229
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:11,162
That I would come by...
Watch you make your move.

230
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:13,231
I had a cousin got hit
by lightning once.

231
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,333
He just developed a stutter.

232
00:12:15,335 --> 00:12:16,835
Huh.
Well, my team and I

233
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:19,904
Are after a nasty meta-human
who makes people angry.

234
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,106
Cool.

235
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:22,841
I mean, awful.

236
00:12:22,843 --> 00:12:24,743
Uh, well, since you guys
are here, why don't we team up?

237
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,511
I'll help you find your
boomerang man, you can help me

238
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:28,246
Find my super rage-a-holic.
We'd love to.

239
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:30,415
No, we'll handle our business
and head home.

240
00:12:30,417 --> 00:12:32,017
The fastest way to find out
everything we need to know

241
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:33,752
About the boomerang is to sic
S.T.A.R. Labs on it.

242
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,954
Enough people know
my secret identity.

243
00:12:35,956 --> 00:12:38,723
Fine... I'll go.
They already know who I am.

244
00:12:38,725 --> 00:12:42,527
You can drop me off, and I will
meet up with you later.

245
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:44,462
- How 'bout I give you a lift?
- Whoo!

246
00:12:48,401 --> 00:12:51,102
Man,
that's not freaking you out?

247
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:53,872
Let's go.

248
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,345
- Oh!
- So what'd you think?

249
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:01,579
I think...

250
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:03,381
My shirt's on fire!

251
00:13:03,383 --> 00:13:05,817
Oh, I'm sorry!

252
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,425
I'm glad I decided
not to go braless.

253
00:13:13,427 --> 00:13:15,026
You guys remember Felicity?

254
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:17,262
I'll always remember this.

255
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:19,330
Hi, Felicity,
it's so good to see you.

256
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:21,866
What brings you
back to Central City?

257
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:23,001
Not Barry?

258
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:24,402
No, not Barry.

259
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:26,805
This?
Not happening.

260
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:29,307
We looked down that road
and we said "no, thank you."

261
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:31,409
They get it.

262
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:35,146
Actually, I'm here...
Because of this.

263
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,948
Awesome!

264
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,483
What are the wings made of?

265
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,385
Not sure... I'm thinking
some sort of composite

266
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:41,920
Or high-density plastic...

267
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:44,022
Reinforced with carbon fiber.
Oh, that's weird.

268
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:46,024
It almost feels like it's...
vibrating.

269
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:47,492
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

270
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,094
Oh, I wanna run some tests,

271
00:13:49,096 --> 00:13:51,396
- And I wanna run 'em right now!
- Mmhmm.

272
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:54,999
Hey, you guys come up
with anything new on our meta?

273
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,901
The officer who was affected
tonight says he saw

274
00:13:56,903 --> 00:13:59,537
A flash of red
before he lost control.

275
00:13:59,539 --> 00:14:03,274
I suspect the meta is inducing
rage via the ocular nerve.

276
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:06,010
Oh, Dr. Wells
wants to see you.

277
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,650
Why do I feel like
I just got called

278
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:14,853
Into the principal's office?

279
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:17,856
Starling City vigilante.

280
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:19,991
He calls himself
"the Arrow" now.

281
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:22,327
Oh, does he...
"Flash"?

282
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:24,295
Wait, what's the problem?

283
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:26,464
We don't trust him.

284
00:14:26,466 --> 00:14:28,533
You guys don't even know him.

285
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,101
I know that he was wanted
for murder

286
00:14:30,103 --> 00:14:32,737
In at least 12 different cases
dating back three years.

287
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:34,839
I know there's been at least
two major terrorist attacks

288
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:36,975
In Starling since
he became active.

289
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:38,409
All right, but the cops there
are cool with him now.

290
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:39,711
He doesn't kill people anymore.

291
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,579
And what about
all the criminals

292
00:14:41,581 --> 00:14:43,615
That he put arrows through?
Those, what, don't count?

293
00:14:43,617 --> 00:14:47,352
- He's a hero, Joe.
- You're a hero, Barry.

294
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:50,021
You offer protection,
hope, light.

295
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:53,758
What that man does is carry out
a dark reckoning for his city.

296
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,361
It is a brutal, violent vision
of justice,

297
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:58,296
One we do not share.
You truly think

298
00:14:58,298 --> 00:14:59,864
He's a hero, fine, so be it.

299
00:14:59,866 --> 00:15:03,535
But he's not the kind
you should be looking up to.

300
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:08,072
Aah!

301
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,081
That's my bad.
That's on me.

302
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,121
I want that "arrow"
out of my city.

303
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:25,023
Tonight.

304
00:15:26,692 --> 00:15:29,761
Tell me, do you think he can
do everything really fast?

305
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:31,729
I mean, like, how fast do you
think he goes to the bathroom

306
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:33,698
After he's eaten something?

307
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,767
This is you watching my back?

308
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:39,569
Well, the Mirakuru soldiers
are one thing, but this...

309
00:15:39,573 --> 00:15:41,773
Whatever he can do now,
he's still the same Barry

310
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,675
- we met last year.
- Well, if you're so adamant

311
00:15:43,677 --> 00:15:45,910
against teaming up with him,
what are we doing here?

312
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:48,980
He's a good kid,
and it's just a name, Diggle.

313
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:52,917
The man who rents
this storage unit...

314
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:56,454
I want... his... name.

315
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:04,162
Hey.

316
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:06,764
The bad guy that you're after,
the one who robbed the bank,

317
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:08,733
His name is Roy G. Bivolo.

318
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:11,769
Uh, thanks.
How did you find that out?

319
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:16,074
The guy's still alive, right?

320
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:17,442
I'm just asking.

321
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:19,043
I thought you
didn't want to help.

322
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:22,780
I'm not.
It's just a name.

323
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:24,115
- All right.
- Hi.

324
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:25,550
- Hey.
- Ooh!

325
00:16:25,552 --> 00:16:28,286
One non-fat latte,
extra sugar for Felicity,

326
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:31,890
And one coffee, black,
for Oliver.

327
00:16:31,892 --> 00:16:34,058
I brewed you a fresh pot,
so...

328
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,128
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

329
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:40,365
Barry, um, can I talk to you
for a second?

330
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:42,333
- Yeah.
- Okay. Bye.

331
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:43,701
Bye.

332
00:16:46,805 --> 00:16:48,306
Ow.
What are you doing?

333
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:51,509
You did not tell me
that you knew Oliver Queen.

334
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:52,810
- I know Oliver Queen.
- Oh, my god,

335
00:16:52,812 --> 00:16:54,412
He's even more handsome
in person.

336
00:16:54,414 --> 00:16:56,581
And his arms are, like,
twice the size of yours.

337
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,683
Technically
they're not twice the size.

338
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,051
He's on my three list.

339
00:17:00,053 --> 00:17:01,786
- What's a three list?
- My list

340
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:03,688
Of three guys I'm allowed
to cheat on Eddie with.

341
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,390
You usually don't meet people
on your list,

342
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:10,161
But now here he is, and I just
cannot stop staring at him.

343
00:17:11,865 --> 00:17:14,699
Felicity,
this is me noticing you staring.

344
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,901
We need to help Barry
with his case.

345
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:18,603
Why don't you want to help?

346
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:20,505
Because Barry doesn't
really want my help.

347
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:22,240
He only thinks he does.

348
00:17:22,242 --> 00:17:24,943
Harrison Wells
and Barry's cop foster dad

349
00:17:24,945 --> 00:17:28,012
Both said you were dangerous
and a bad influence.

350
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:30,682
Barry defended you.

351
00:17:30,684 --> 00:17:32,250
You're going to hock me
about this

352
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:34,953
Until I say yes, aren't you?

353
00:17:34,955 --> 00:17:37,922
I'm a hocker.

354
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:42,727
Okay.

355
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:43,761
- Okay, what?
- Okay, we'll help you

356
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:45,063
Catch your bad guy.

357
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:46,631
Great.
Meta-human.

358
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:49,133
I am not calling him that,
Barry.

359
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,037
Partners?

360
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,073
Partners.

361
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:09,787
- Hey.
- You're late.

362
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:11,849
Barry, how can you have
super-speed

363
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:13,258
and still not be on time?

364
00:18:13,266 --> 00:18:17,428
Sorry, I guess the super-tardiness
kinda neutralizes it.

365
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,064
So how do we catch Bivolo here?

366
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:23,267
Oh, no, we don't here.
We're here to train.

367
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,203
What?
Like<i> Rocky?</i>

368
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,374
I read your friend Iris'
blog post on the Flash,

369
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:32,677
And I visited all
the crime scenes you fought at.

370
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:34,045
- Don't you sleep?
- Last month

371
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:36,180
You took on a man
named Leonard Snart.

372
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:37,582
We call him Captain Cold.

373
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:39,117
We can talk about you giving
your enemies

374
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:40,852
Silly code names later.

375
00:18:40,854 --> 00:18:44,022
You mean like over coffee with
deathstroke and the huntress?

376
00:18:44,024 --> 00:18:47,191
The point is that you engaged
Snart on a commuter train,

377
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:48,860
Which he derailed.

378
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:51,929
Okay, there may have been some
damage, but I got the job done,

379
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:53,891
- I was the hero.
- Barry, when you approach

380
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,568
a new environment,
do you case every inch of it?

381
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:01,506
You could.
You have the time.

382
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:04,375
But you don't.

383
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:06,344
You just run in blind.

384
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:09,847
There's a difference, Barry,
between having powers

385
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:11,482
And having precision.

386
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,550
When I came to you
thinking about

387
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:13,751
Going out and helping people,

388
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:15,486
You said
I could be an inspiration.

389
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:17,088
Living this life...

390
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:19,123
Well,
it takes more than a mask.

391
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,691
It takes discipline.

392
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:23,194
And since you are probably
as stubborn as I am...

393
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:26,264
What is that for?

394
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:28,332
You're going to run
over there,

395
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:29,901
You're going to come back at me,

396
00:19:29,903 --> 00:19:31,102
And you're going to get hit
with an arrow.

397
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:34,072
No, I'm not.

398
00:19:34,074 --> 00:19:36,407
Yes, you are.

399
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:39,077
Okay, fine,

400
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:40,845
I will humor you.

401
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,115
Ready?

402
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:48,186
Ready.

403
00:19:51,657 --> 00:19:53,057
Nice try.

404
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:56,561
Gah!
Ah!

405
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:58,696
What, you shot me?

406
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,498
I heard you heal fast.

407
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:03,835
Oh, god!

408
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:11,409
Hey.
What's up?

409
00:20:11,411 --> 00:20:15,446
Eddie's making his case
for the task force again.

410
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:17,448
But I thought the Captain
shot him down already.

411
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:20,685
Well, apparently
he's got a new argument.

412
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:23,454
The arrow made another
appearance last night.

413
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:26,357
And you forgot to tell me
that you got Bivolo's name

414
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,693
From shooting that storage guy
in the leg.

415
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:30,461
Well, technically
I didn't shoot him.

416
00:20:30,463 --> 00:20:32,330
Well, what word
would you use to describe

417
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:33,764
How you got this info?

418
00:20:33,766 --> 00:20:37,735
I'm gonna go with "torture."

419
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,804
I don't... the Arrow
gets results.

420
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:41,405
He's a crazy man.

421
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,808
Look, I don't actually
disagree with you at the moment,

422
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:45,109
But we wouldn't even have
Bivolo's name

423
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:46,944
If it weren't for the Arrow.

424
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:50,047
So maybe instead of judging him,
you should just be thanking him.

425
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:52,150
Two things I won't be doing
in this life...

426
00:20:52,152 --> 00:20:56,754
Playing professional baseball,
and thanking that lunatic.

427
00:20:59,058 --> 00:21:00,791
Stay.

428
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:02,326
Have you heard
of color psychology?

429
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:03,761
The theory that changes
in the color spectrum

430
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:05,229
Can affect emotion.

431
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:07,598
It is so nice to have
another woman to talk to.

432
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,933
I know.

433
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,535
I was thinking
that if Bivolo uses color

434
00:21:10,537 --> 00:21:12,203
To induce the temporary
psychosis,

435
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:14,305
Maybe we can use light and color
to reverse it.

436
00:21:14,307 --> 00:21:18,209
Miss Smoak,
a word, if you please.

437
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:24,715
Hey, what's up, doc?

438
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:26,651
Sorry, that was dumb.

439
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:28,486
Remember I went to M.I.T.

440
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:30,121
Yes, you're smart.

441
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:33,224
Felicity, I like to surround my
team with known quantities.

442
00:21:33,226 --> 00:21:34,759
That is because I find
the unknown

443
00:21:34,761 --> 00:21:37,929
To be toxic, dangerous.

444
00:21:37,931 --> 00:21:40,965
The arrow is unknown.

445
00:21:42,334 --> 00:21:46,304
I can assure you, Dr. Wells,
he's not dangerous.

446
00:21:46,306 --> 00:21:48,206
To us.

447
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:51,242
Well, of that,
I have little doubt.

448
00:21:51,244 --> 00:21:54,645
And yet, I find myself
with a conundrum.

449
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:59,850
How can I completely trust a man
when I don't even know his name?

450
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:01,953
And so, I was hoping,
Miss Smoak,

451
00:22:01,955 --> 00:22:04,522
That you could help me
trust him.

452
00:22:04,524 --> 00:22:08,192
Who is he under the hood?

453
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:11,729
That is not my secret to tell,
Dr. Wells.

454
00:22:17,202 --> 00:22:20,705
Of course.

455
00:22:20,707 --> 00:22:23,941
I'll figure it out on my own.

456
00:22:26,546 --> 00:22:28,112
- Hey.
- Hey.

457
00:22:28,114 --> 00:22:29,680
How'd it go with Oliver?

458
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:30,915
You know, to be honest,
not exactly the partnership

459
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:32,283
I thought it would be.

460
00:22:32,285 --> 00:22:34,719
Oh, did he really do the thing
with the arrows?

461
00:22:34,721 --> 00:22:36,220
You knew
he was going to shoot me?

462
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:37,622
Whoa, it is practically
impossible to tell

463
00:22:37,624 --> 00:22:38,689
When Oliver's making a joke.

464
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,524
Hey, we just got a ping from

465
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:43,027
The facial recognition software
on Bivolo, aka, Prism.

466
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:44,929
Since when do we have
facial recognition software?

467
00:22:44,931 --> 00:22:46,497
- Happy Chanukah.
- Where can I find him?

468
00:22:46,499 --> 00:22:48,899
Traffic cameras just caught
him entering a residence

469
00:22:48,901 --> 00:22:50,868
At 168 Jarvis.

470
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,503
We should let the Arrow know.

471
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:54,205
I can handle this solo.
I've done it before.

472
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:55,873
Barry, I really think
you need to wait...

473
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:59,176
Felicity,
I don't need his help.

474
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:23,034
I knew you'd be coming
for me.

475
00:23:23,036 --> 00:23:25,536
I could see it in your eyes
at the bank.

476
00:23:25,538 --> 00:23:29,040
When I turned those people
against each other,

477
00:23:29,042 --> 00:23:31,876
It made you angry.

478
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,117
Have some real anger.

479
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,830
No signs of macular damage.

480
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:55,466
Your retina and cornea
seem unaffected.

481
00:23:55,468 --> 00:23:56,801
I told you, I'm fine.

482
00:23:56,803 --> 00:23:58,736
You said Bivolo whammied you.

483
00:23:58,738 --> 00:24:01,305
No desire to go MMA
on any of us?

484
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:02,337
No.

485
00:24:02,342 --> 00:24:04,642
Yeah, I mean,
something weird happened

486
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,770
- with his eyes for a sec.
- Weird thing?

487
00:24:06,813 --> 00:24:09,413
Yeah, everything went red.

488
00:24:09,415 --> 00:24:11,148
You were right.

489
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:14,151
Okay, next thing you know,
Bivolo was gone.

490
00:24:14,153 --> 00:24:16,020
Look, obviously his powers
didn't work on me, so...

491
00:24:16,022 --> 00:24:18,456
It was stupid for you
to go out there alone.

492
00:24:18,458 --> 00:24:20,191
You take too many risks.

493
00:24:20,193 --> 00:24:22,760
As fast as you are, that's going
to catch up with you.

494
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:24,228
Caitlin, I'm not Ronnie.

495
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,263
You gotta stop treating me
like I am.

496
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:32,336
You're right.
You're not.

497
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:38,943
What?

498
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,446
You are such a lovable dummy.

499
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,885
It's Oliver... he wants
to have another session.

500
00:24:47,887 --> 00:24:50,888
I'm sure he's not going
to shoot you again.

501
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:53,391
Maybe you should
wear body armor.

502
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:59,597
Thinking of new ways
to embarrass me?

503
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:01,432
I'm not trying
to embarrass you, Barry,

504
00:25:01,434 --> 00:25:04,835
But you went after Bivolo
last night alone

505
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,303
And you lost him.

506
00:25:06,305 --> 00:25:08,305
And you've never
had a misstep?

507
00:25:08,307 --> 00:25:09,974
Course I've had missteps.

508
00:25:09,976 --> 00:25:14,478
Barry, I have been living this
life for almost eight years,

509
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,648
Encountering things
that you can't even fathom,

510
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:20,117
And I am still alive.

511
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:24,555
Not because super-speed
kept me out of the ground.

512
00:25:24,557 --> 00:25:28,426
It was because I realized
that I needed to keep learning,

513
00:25:28,428 --> 00:25:31,128
Keep training,
keep getting smarter,

514
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:35,199
And until you get that,
despite your best intentions,

515
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:38,102
You will do more harm than good.

516
00:25:38,104 --> 00:25:41,505
I finally see it.

517
00:25:41,507 --> 00:25:44,608
You're a little bit
jealous of me, aren't you?

518
00:25:45,811 --> 00:25:48,813
A guy like you, handsome, rich,

519
00:25:48,815 --> 00:25:50,548
Can have any girl he wants,

520
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:53,083
Jealousy's probably
a new emotion for you,

521
00:25:53,085 --> 00:25:55,920
So you might be a little slow
to get what it is

522
00:25:55,922 --> 00:25:57,488
That you're feeling.

523
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:00,324
- That's your theory?
- Absolutely.

524
00:26:00,326 --> 00:26:03,194
So you can train, lift weights,

525
00:26:03,196 --> 00:26:06,030
Climb that stupid barn
till your heart explodes,

526
00:26:06,032 --> 00:26:09,099
But you'll never be
as fast as I am.

527
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:12,503
You'll never be what I am.

528
00:26:12,505 --> 00:26:16,574
And that's gotta hurt
your rock-hard pride, Ollie.

529
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,444
I told Felicity
you didn't want my help.

530
00:26:20,446 --> 00:26:23,414
Yeah. You're finally right
about something.

531
00:26:27,352 --> 00:26:29,286
Allen! Where are you
with the Bivolo case?

532
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:30,821
I'm working it.

533
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:32,456
Care to be more specific?

534
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:34,825
Hey, how 'bout you answer me
when I ask you a question?

535
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:36,861
Hey!
How 'bout you back off?

536
00:26:36,863 --> 00:26:39,296
Excuse me?

537
00:26:39,298 --> 00:26:42,533
Look, I work just as hard
as anyone in this building.

538
00:26:42,535 --> 00:26:45,603
I don't need you constantly
berating me to do my job.

539
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:47,538
When it's done,
you will have it, all right?

540
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:51,008
Sorry, Captain.
He's having an allergic reaction

541
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,043
To some bad medication.

542
00:26:53,045 --> 00:26:55,679
You remind him
who answers to who.

543
00:26:58,016 --> 00:26:59,517
Have you lost your mind?

544
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:01,118
I'm so sick of Singh talking
to me like that.

545
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,553
He's still our boss.

546
00:27:02,555 --> 00:27:04,421
Now I know you're upset
about losing Bivolo...

547
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:07,591
Wait, wait...
You're just like him.

548
00:27:07,593 --> 00:27:10,594
Like Wells, and Oliver,
and everyone else my whole life

549
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:12,296
That didn't think
I could get the job done.

550
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:14,832
Do you want to help me, Joe?
You want to help me?

551
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:16,467
Get my dad out of prison.

552
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:17,935
You helped put him there,
didn't you?

553
00:27:17,937 --> 00:27:20,371
Barry, I need you
to calm down.

554
00:27:20,373 --> 00:27:23,340
Why don't we both
take a ride to S.T.A.R. Labs?

555
00:27:23,342 --> 00:27:25,075
I'm calm!
Okay?

556
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:28,579
When I am not calm,
you'll know.

557
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:38,789
Okay.
I'll call you back later.

558
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:40,224
That was the Arrow.

559
00:27:40,226 --> 00:27:42,793
He says Barry
is acting strangely.

560
00:27:42,795 --> 00:27:43,994
Strangely, how?

561
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:46,430
He's been whammied.

562
00:27:46,432 --> 00:27:49,099
He was acting angry.
It was scary.

563
00:27:49,101 --> 00:27:52,202
And his eyes...
They glowed.

564
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:54,805
It's possible that his body
is fighting off the effect,

565
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:56,974
So it's hitting him slower.
When it comes to rage,

566
00:27:56,976 --> 00:27:58,342
That is not a good thing.

567
00:27:58,344 --> 00:27:59,810
The longer you suppress
your emotions...

568
00:27:59,812 --> 00:28:01,312
The bigger the explosion.

569
00:28:01,314 --> 00:28:03,981
Considering what he can do,
how do we even stop him?

570
00:28:03,983 --> 00:28:07,251
A cold-gun would come in
real handy right about now.

571
00:28:07,253 --> 00:28:09,320
- Hey.
- I'm just sayin'.

572
00:28:09,322 --> 00:28:12,456
None of us can stop Barry.

573
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:15,859
Fortunately,
Felicity knows someone who can.

574
00:28:15,861 --> 00:28:19,530
I think you better call back
Oliver Queen.

575
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:22,700
We're gonna need
the Arrow's help.

576
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:37,748
Is this your way of telling me

577
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:39,883
That you want satellite radio
for Christmas?

578
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,554
Look, I am not mad at you.

579
00:28:43,556 --> 00:28:46,757
Good, 'cause there's no reason
you should be.

580
00:28:46,759 --> 00:28:51,028
Eddie, both you and the Flash
care about protecting this city.

581
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,930
You would both
give your lives for it.

582
00:28:52,932 --> 00:28:55,099
You're more alike
than you think, okay?

583
00:28:55,101 --> 00:28:58,235
He's not the bad guy.

584
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:01,205
How do you know
so much about him, Iris?

585
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,077
He got in touch with me
after I started the blog,

586
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:10,914
And I've seen him
a couple times.

587
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,783
A couple times?

588
00:29:12,785 --> 00:29:14,685
Why didn't you tell me
about this?

589
00:29:14,687 --> 00:29:16,320
Well, given the fact
that I think he's a hero,

590
00:29:16,322 --> 00:29:17,755
And you want to put him in jail,

591
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:19,556
Do you really need
to ask that question?

592
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:22,893
How could you ever think
I would be okay with this?

593
00:29:33,805 --> 00:29:36,407
I heard you've been looking
for me.

594
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:44,481
All this time,
you've been trying to catch me,

595
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:47,718
And I caught you first.

596
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,120
Guess you haven't read
your girlfriend's blog.

597
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:51,288
Eddie, no!

598
00:29:56,528 --> 00:30:00,698
Ooh, see I knew the Arrow
was Oliver Queen.

599
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,367
I mean, I had it narrowed down
to, like, a list of 150 people,

600
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:06,070
But he was definitely
on that list.

601
00:30:06,072 --> 00:30:08,806
Do you have a way to stop
Barry's rage-fest?

602
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:10,474
I have an idea
about how to do that.

603
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:12,643
Joe, we're gonna need
your help.

604
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:14,812
We need to find him first
before he hurts somebody.

605
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:16,547
I have him.

606
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:20,117
Facial recognition picked him up
on a traffic camera downtown.

607
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:21,552
Oh, god.

608
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:28,258
Eddie!

609
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,094
Who the hell are you, huh?

610
00:30:30,096 --> 00:30:31,462
You think
you can just come along

611
00:30:31,464 --> 00:30:33,497
And get to have
whatever you want?

612
00:30:33,499 --> 00:30:35,365
What gives you the right?

613
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:36,934
What the hell
are you talking about?

614
00:30:36,936 --> 00:30:39,970
What are you doing?
What has happened to you?

615
00:30:39,972 --> 00:30:41,171
I feel fine.

616
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:42,773
You are not fine.

617
00:30:42,775 --> 00:30:45,409
How would you know?
Because you write about me?

618
00:30:45,411 --> 00:30:48,011
You don't know me!

619
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:49,947
You don't know who I am.

620
00:30:49,949 --> 00:30:52,149
You never did.
I know that you have

621
00:30:52,151 --> 00:30:54,718
Risked your life
to help people,

622
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,754
To save them!
Someone who does that

623
00:30:56,756 --> 00:31:00,257
Does not suddenly turn around
and want to hurt people.

624
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:02,793
Please.

625
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:12,402
Run!

626
00:31:12,404 --> 00:31:14,338
Eddie, run!

627
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:19,109
You need to calm down.

628
00:31:19,111 --> 00:31:21,712
And you need to hold on.

629
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:28,986
I just hope
they can turn Barry back

630
00:31:28,988 --> 00:31:30,487
Before he kills Oliver.

631
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:31,688
Me, I'd be more worried
about what Oliver

632
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,423
Might have to do to Barry.

633
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:35,659
Barry has superpowers.
Oliver has a bow and arrow.

634
00:31:35,661 --> 00:31:37,327
Do you have any idea
how many people

635
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:39,563
Oliver has killed
with that bow and arrow?

636
00:31:39,565 --> 00:31:42,166
Recurve bow arrows can travel
up to 300 feet per second,

637
00:31:42,168 --> 00:31:43,500
So, like, 200 miles an hour.

638
00:31:43,502 --> 00:31:45,035
Barry can run three times
that fast.

639
00:31:45,037 --> 00:31:46,670
Whatever.
Oliver's been doing this

640
00:31:46,672 --> 00:31:48,605
A lot longer.
My money's on experience.

641
00:31:48,607 --> 00:31:49,907
My money's on speed.

642
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:51,408
Please tell me
you're not actually

643
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,010
Having this conversation
right now.

644
00:31:57,949 --> 00:31:59,349
You missed.

645
00:31:59,351 --> 00:32:00,984
No.

646
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:02,820
Aah!

647
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,898
2000 milligrams
of horse tranquilizer

648
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,900
Should be hitting you
any time now.

649
00:32:44,495 --> 00:32:47,231
Where you going?

650
00:32:47,233 --> 00:32:48,699
We're not done!

651
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:00,711
Is that all you got?

652
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,585
Oliver, get up.

653
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:47,925
Fool me once.

654
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:58,235
Ah... Ah... Ah!

655
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:05,609
I still believe in you, Barry.

656
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:15,719
Is this even going to work?

657
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:17,187
He just needs to see
the right colors.

658
00:34:17,189 --> 00:34:19,690
Now, Joe!

659
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:45,515
Barry, you okay?

660
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:51,254
Oh, this is going to be
a special kind of hangover.

661
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,364
So...

662
00:35:00,366 --> 00:35:02,766
It was a tie.

663
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:06,169
Oliver...

664
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:07,437
I'm so sorry.

665
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,172
It's not your fault.

666
00:35:09,174 --> 00:35:12,642
But we do still have your
meta-human to take care of.

667
00:35:12,644 --> 00:35:14,811
Anything left in the tank?

668
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:17,848
Well, if not,
there's two of us, right?

669
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:19,850
Right.

670
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:28,058
You think this will stop me?

671
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:30,394
I will make you tear each other
to pieces!

672
00:35:30,396 --> 00:35:31,895
You will all die
screaming with rage!

673
00:35:31,897 --> 00:35:34,431
Blah, blah, blah,
"no prison can hold me."

674
00:35:34,433 --> 00:35:36,066
Heard it all before, pal.

675
00:35:36,068 --> 00:35:37,501
Adios, Prism.

676
00:35:37,503 --> 00:35:39,369
I liked "rainbow raider."

677
00:35:39,371 --> 00:35:40,871
Okay, you don't get
to pick the names.

678
00:35:40,873 --> 00:35:42,639
I have a prison like this.

679
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:45,709
Mine's on a nearly inhospitable
island in the North China sea,

680
00:35:45,711 --> 00:35:48,945
But this works too.

681
00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:53,216
My identity is a closely-guarded
secret known only to a few,

682
00:35:53,218 --> 00:35:57,954
And if it were to get out,
will endanger my family,

683
00:35:57,956 --> 00:36:00,957
My friends,
and it would embolden

684
00:36:00,959 --> 00:36:03,760
My enemies to retaliate
at me through them.

685
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:06,296
What Oliver is trying to say

686
00:36:06,298 --> 00:36:07,931
Is that he had a lovely time
working with you

687
00:36:07,933 --> 00:36:10,133
And getting to know each of you,

688
00:36:10,135 --> 00:36:13,036
And he can't wait
to do it again soon.

689
00:36:13,038 --> 00:36:14,638
Right.

690
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,975
You know, it didn't sound like
that's what he was saying.

691
00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:21,978
I may not agree
with your methods, but...

692
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:24,681
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

693
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,450
Hey.
If I had a DNA sample

694
00:36:26,452 --> 00:36:28,085
I was unable
to fully break down,

695
00:36:28,087 --> 00:36:30,821
do you think you could isolate
the genetic markers for me?

696
00:36:30,823 --> 00:36:32,789
Sure, what's the sample from?

697
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:35,058
The canary's murder.

698
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,694
Of course.

699
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:43,800
Mr. Queen,
I met your father once.

700
00:36:43,802 --> 00:36:45,902
Charity event.

701
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:48,972
One of the things
we spoke of was you.

702
00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:54,311
I think he would be very proud
of the man you've become.

703
00:36:54,313 --> 00:36:55,846
Thank you.

704
00:36:55,848 --> 00:36:59,983
And please, call me Oliver.

705
00:37:04,922 --> 00:37:08,725
There is something off
about that guy.

706
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:18,668
Captain Singh approved
the task force.

707
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:21,404
You wanted me to believe
the Flash was real.

708
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:23,573
Now I do.

709
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:25,542
I believe he's dangerous,

710
00:37:25,544 --> 00:37:28,645
And I am going to take him in.

711
00:37:28,647 --> 00:37:32,716
How do you feel about that?

712
00:37:32,718 --> 00:37:35,285
All I know...

713
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:37,254
is how I feel about you.

714
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:53,103
Hey!
You guys heading home?

715
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:54,804
Yeah, we could use some Javas
for the road.

716
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:55,906
I will hook you up.

717
00:37:55,908 --> 00:37:58,441
- Okay.
- Thank you.

718
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:04,247
Um, so listen...

719
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:07,784
I'm really sorry
for what I said in the field

720
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09,553
And then last night
in the street.

721
00:38:09,555 --> 00:38:12,756
I wish I could say it was all
because of whatever Bivolo

722
00:38:12,758 --> 00:38:15,025
Did to me, but I guess I had

723
00:38:15,027 --> 00:38:17,294
More feelings bottled up
than I thought.

724
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,497
You can always talk to me.

725
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:23,033
Yeah.
Thank you.

726
00:38:23,035 --> 00:38:25,669
And you were right,
I still have...

727
00:38:25,671 --> 00:38:27,571
A lot to learn.

728
00:38:27,573 --> 00:38:29,472
There's one more thing...

729
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:32,108
And you're not going to like it.

730
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:34,411
Does it involve
you shooting me in the back?

731
00:38:34,413 --> 00:38:37,948
No.
No, the heart.

732
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:43,420
That's not going
to work out for you.

733
00:38:43,422 --> 00:38:45,322
You need to let her go,

734
00:38:45,324 --> 00:38:48,191
For both of your sakes.

735
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,402
Guys like us don't get the girl.

736
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:03,373
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

737
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:06,643
- This one's yours.
- Thank you.

738
00:39:06,645 --> 00:39:08,211
Oliver.

739
00:39:10,581 --> 00:39:12,849
- Hi.
- Hi.

740
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,519
- How are you?
- Good, good.

741
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:18,755
It's been a long time.

742
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:23,994
We never spoke after,
and I'm so sorry.

743
00:39:23,996 --> 00:39:27,030
No, I'm sorry.

744
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:29,766
I heard about your mother...

745
00:39:29,768 --> 00:39:31,534
She loved you very much.

746
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:35,405
She did.

747
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:40,210
- I should get going.
- All right.

748
00:39:44,782 --> 00:39:46,449
- Who was that?
- Hmm?

749
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:52,489
Someone that I used to know.

750
00:39:52,491 --> 00:39:54,491
Hi, sweetheart.

751
00:39:54,493 --> 00:39:58,028
Yes, I'm just getting you
a hot chocolate.

752
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:03,366
Mommy will be home soon.

753
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,244
Got your message.

754
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:17,881
I wanted you to know,
last night...

755
00:40:17,883 --> 00:40:19,549
That wasn't me.

756
00:40:19,551 --> 00:40:21,184
Sure looked like you.

757
00:40:21,186 --> 00:40:24,421
Yeah. I was affected
by one of the meta-humans.

758
00:40:24,423 --> 00:40:26,256
He messed with my head.

759
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:29,726
But I'm okay now, I promise.

760
00:40:29,728 --> 00:40:32,195
I defended you.

761
00:40:32,197 --> 00:40:35,065
Everyone told me that you would
bring me nothing but danger.

762
00:40:35,067 --> 00:40:38,201
My father, Barry, Eddie...

763
00:40:38,203 --> 00:40:41,971
I didn't listen to them.
I never listened to them.

764
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:45,275
But now it's time I did.

765
00:40:45,277 --> 00:40:48,945
Don't contact me anymore,
okay?

766
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:53,516
Iris...

767
00:40:53,518 --> 00:40:55,985
I'm sorry.

768
00:40:55,987 --> 00:40:59,089
Me too.

769
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:04,961

775
00:41:38,463 --> 00:41:41,464
Anyone tell you not to hang out
under the freeway at night?

776
00:41:41,466 --> 00:41:44,768
You're liable to get robbed.

777
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:46,202
You got the shakes, man?

778
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:49,072
What are you, tweaking,
or just cold?

779
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,082
I'm not cold.
