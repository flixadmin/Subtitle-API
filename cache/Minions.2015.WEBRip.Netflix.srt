1
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,190
Minions.

2
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:51,111
Minions have been on this planet
far longer than we have.

3
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:56,449
They go by many names.
Dave, Carl, Paul, Mike.

4
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,078
That one is Norbert.

5
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:02,497
He's an idiot.

6
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:06,417
They're all different,
but they all share the same goals.

7
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:10,588
To serve the most despicable master
they could find.

8
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:11,589
Boss!

9
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:21,015
Making their master happy was
the tribe's very reason for existence.

10
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,270
But that's not to say
that they didn't have other passions.

11
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,313
Looka!

12
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:28,898
Move over.

13
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,068
Banana!

14
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,197
Finding a boss was easy.

15
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:41,244
But keeping a boss, therein lies the rub.

16
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,829
Nope, it wasn't easy for these guys.

17
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,789
But they never gave up.

18
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:32,253
With the emergence of the Stone Age
came the rise of a new species.

19
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,381
Man was very different from the dinosaur.

20
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,133
He was shorter, hairier,

21
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,802
and way, way smarter.

22
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:50,688
The Minions took an instant liking to man,
and helped him the best they could.

23
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:11,876
Poor man. So trusting, so fragile.

24
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,045
So, so delicious!

25
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:18,216
Their quest for a boss
put the Minions front and center

26
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:21,511
for some of civilization's
most historic moments.

27
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,515
Anubis!

28
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,644
Ancient Egypt held great promise.

29
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,188
Okay!

30
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:33,940
Pancake!

31
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:38,361
But it didn't last long.

32
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,828
The Dark Ages were actually fun times.

33
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:53,167
Their new master had a tendency
to party all night and sleep all day.

34
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,762
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
357

35
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:12,437
But eventually, the party was over.

36
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:18,276
They bounced
from one evil boss to another,

37
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:21,446
but they never seemed to find
their perfect fit.

38
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:28,786
One particular employer
took their failure very, very badly.

39
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:43,634
The Minions had no other choice
but to keep moving.

40
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,559
And then, when all hope seemed lost,

41
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,020
they found sanctuary.

42
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:57,482
The Minions were safe!

43
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:29,222
Years passed as the Minions
forged their own civilization.

44
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:31,974
They truly made a life for themselves.

45
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:34,560
But something just wasn't right.

46
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,985
They felt empty inside.

47
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,113
Without a master, they had no purpose.

48
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,116
They became aimless and depressed.

49
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:57,834
If this continued any longer,
the Minions would perish.

50
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:04,799
But all was not lost
for one Minion had a plan.

51
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,677
His name was Kevin.

52
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,516
He was excited to share
his idea with the tribe.

53
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:17,645
He'd been preparing
for days, weeks, months.

54
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:20,565
But now he was ready!

55
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,467
Kevin would leave the cave,
go back to the outside world,

56
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,969
and he would not return
until he had found his tribe

57
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:52,305
the biggest, baddest villain to serve.

58
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:54,974
But he needed help.

59
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,020
Bob was eager to go,

60
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,856
but Kevin felt he was
just not strong enough

61
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,483
for the dangerous journey ahead.

62
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,952
Luckily, someone stepped up.

63
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:16,996
Stuart, come.

64
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,582
Me? Thank you.

65
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,752
Truth be told, Stuart had no idea
what he was chosen for,

66
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,295
Por que...

67
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:28,174
but was thrilled
it made people cheer for him.

68
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:37,808
Soy fuerto.

69
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:42,480
See?

70
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,360
Okay. No otra?

71
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,995
Eventually, Bob's energy and enthusiasm,

72
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,666
but mostly lack of other volunteers,
changed Kevin's mind.

73
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,461
-Kumbaya!
-Kumbaya!

74
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,424
The tribe said their farewells.

75
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,553
Kevin had given them something
they hadn't had in a very long time.

76
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:14,845
Hope.

77
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:18,766
Hey, Tony.

78
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:20,810
Tom...

79
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:22,478
Hey, Chris.

80
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:25,731
Hey, Bob.

81
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:32,947
Bye-bye.

82
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,913
Kevin felt pride.

83
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,624
He was going to be the one
to save his tribe.

84
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,670
Stuart felt hungry mostly.

85
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,047
He was going to be the one
to eat this banana.

86
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,092
And Bob...

87
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,805
Bob was frightened of the journey ahead.

88
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,324
And they were off.

89
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,660
Off to find their new boss!

90
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,378
Banana?

107

Yeah, go Bob!

122
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,376
Kevin?

Or will it be Stuart?

124
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:28,260
Gosh! This is so hard!
They all sounded so cute.

125
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,180
I think I'm gonna go with...

Heck, yeah!

169
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:16,590
Thanks, man!

170
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,135
All right-y!
Who needs to stretch their legs?

171
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,553
-Yeah!
-Yes! Me, me, me!

172
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,097
-Sweet!
-You guys wait here, we'll be right back.

173
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,183
Okay, Nelsons, let's do this!

174
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,692
BANK

175
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:36,944
Go, go, go!

176
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,532
Okey-dokey. On the road again.

177
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,876
Dad! We got company!

178
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,046
It's because I tripped the alarm. I stink!

179
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:58,298
Hey, we all make mistakes, sugarplum.

180
00:20:58,757 --> 00:20:59,675
You're still learning.

181
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,469
What?

182
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,680
-Your father's right, Tina.
-Reload!

183
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,848
He wasn't this good
at being evil overnight!

184
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:08,600
-Reload!
-Your time's coming.

185
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,104
It's jammed!

186
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,057
Okay, who did that?

187
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,186
That was great!

188
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,776
Say, fellas, can we get personal
for just a second?

189
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:03,322
Why are you going to Orlando?

190
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,825
Come on. You can tell us.

191
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,410
You're going to Villain-Con, aren't you?

192
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,750
Wow! So many bad guys in the car.

193
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:15,667
What fun!

194
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,754
I knew it! I knew you were villains!
Didn't I, honey?

195
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:21,465
What a small world!
Hope we're not in rival gangs.

196
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,011
Binky! Joke! Babies, huh?

197
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:28,532
When we get to Orlando,

198
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,368
I'm gonna get all my favorite villains
to sign my magazine!

199
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,995
Dumo the Sumo!

200
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:37,958
Kevin, you don't wanna work for him!

201
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,417
He ate his last henchmen!

202
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,921
Frankie, fish lips.

203
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,089
He lives in the ocean.

204
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,676
Can you breathe underwater?

205
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,431
Look at her! Scarlet Overkill!

206
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,892
The coolest super-villain, like, ever!

207
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,353
She started out
as your average little girl,

208
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:59,771
braces, pigtails.

209
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:03,483
But by the time she was 13,
she built a criminal empire!

Welcome to Billy Bob's Bait Shop.
How can I help you?

218
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:39,728
Yeah, hi.

219
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:44,107
We're here for so much fun, it's a crime.

Well, this is it!
I wanna tell you, and I really mean this.

224
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,312
I really appreciate what you did
back there with the cops. Really!

225
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:27,025
Dad! It's Frankie Fish Lips!
I can smell him from here!

226
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:29,861
-Junior! Get my camera!
-Good luck in there, boys!

Not bad.

What about you? Any evil talents?

237
00:25:58,932 --> 00:25:59,891
SHUT UP!
AND WAIT YOUR TURN

238
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,398
That's not evil or a talent.

239
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:22,664
I'm sorry! But I'm not looking
for any more servants,

Hello!

243
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:41,683
Move that over there,
Professor Flux from two weeks from now.

244
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,436
As you can see, I don't need any help.

Scarlet Overkill!

251
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:07,709
The world's first female super-villain!

252
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:11,921
Appearing right now in Hall H!

00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:21,514
Are you ready

255
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:26,936
for Scarlet Overkill!

256
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:34,235
Doesn't it feel so good to be bad?

257
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,155
-Scarlet! Scarlet! Scarlet!
-Yes!

258
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,136
Awesome!

259
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:07,227
Wow! Thank you!

260
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,978
Scarlet! Scarlet!

261
00:28:09,312 --> 00:28:11,147
Thank you so much!

262
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:13,149
Okay.

263
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:22,450
When I started out, people said a woman
could never rob a bank as well as a man!

264
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:23,827
Well,

265
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,205
times change!

266
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,666
I love you, Scarlet!

267
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,876
Look at all those faces out there!

268
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,546
We are all so different!

269
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:36,714
But we have one thing in common.

270
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,926
We were born with flippers!

271
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:42,512
No?

272
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:43,680
Just me?

273
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:45,515
Okay.

274
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:48,435
We have big dreams!

275
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,229
And we will do anything
to make them come true!

276
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,940
Have any of you ever dreamt

277
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:58,528
of working for the greatest
super-villain of all time?

278
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:06,077
Well, what if I were to tell you

279
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:09,414
that I am looking for new henchmen?

280
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:16,463
I truly believe somewhere out there

281
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:20,091
is a villain with the potential
to serve greatness!

282
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:22,927
And it could be any of you.

283
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,389
Although, let's not kid ourselves.

284
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:31,853
Truly, the only men for this job
are Kevin and his Minions!

285
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:36,399
Ten times the evil
in half the package! I am just in awe!

286
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,443
Let's hear it for Kevin.

287
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,196
He saved his tribe!

288
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:53,917
So, how should we do this?

289
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,172
You see this tiny little trinket?

290
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:01,966
Well, just take it from my hand
and you've got the job.

291
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,219
No big deal, it's almost too simple.

292
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,764
Come on! Don't be afraid.

293
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:10,433
Just take the stone and get that job!

294
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,476
Come on!

295
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:12,519
Okay.

296
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:15,980
That job is mine!

297
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,656
Now go easy on me.

298
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,578
Love the costume!

299
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,085
So cool!

300
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,851
Is no one good enough?

301
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:07,782
I got it! I got it!

302
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:23,006
Didn't my speech inspire anyone
to rise up and prove themselves worthy?

303
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:27,218
All these villains
and yet I still have the bear.

304
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,387
Stuffed bear! Why am I holding a bear?

305
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:31,598
Who has the ruby?

306
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,106
Wow!

307
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,567
Who are you, my...

308
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,653
knights in shining denim?

309
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:52,076
That was incredible!

310
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:58,458
Behold! The last creatures you'd expect
to win the day have emerged victorious!

311
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,419
Everyone, meet my new henchmen.

312
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,379
The Minions!

313
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:13,848
I know those guys!
I gave them a ride here!

314
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:22,148
Buckle up, boys! Next stop, England.

315
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,272
Hello, Kevin? So, did you say England?

316
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,107
Le Boss, si.

317
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:47,358
Scarlet Popapil?

318
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:59,203
Hello? Hello!

319
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:00,830
Que pasa?

320
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:01,873
Hello?

321
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,394
Here we go! There.

322
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:27,565
By the way, I really like your bear.

323
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:31,360
-Herb! My baby!
-You know I am!

324
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:34,238
How'd it go? Were you evil?

325
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,032
So evil!

326
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:39,202
A little bird dropped this off today.

327
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:42,622
I Missed You!
H.

328
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,957
It's me, I'm the "H."

329
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,877
Also, there was no bird. Also me.

330
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:52,256
Herb, seriously, I wanna dig up
that William Shakespeare

331
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,550
so he can see what true writing is.

332
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:58,221
-I love it!
-That works out because I love...

333
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:01,307
Well, I love...too.

334
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:09,023
Boys, could you come here, please?

335
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,734
Meet my husband, Herb.

336
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,530
Inventor, super genius, fox.

337
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,866
Herb, these are the new recruits.

338
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,370
Kevin, Stuart,
and that cute little one is Bob.

339
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:27,583
Right on! You guys are crazy little
and way yellow,

340
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,544
and I dig that!

341
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,674
Sweet, man!

342
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:42,890
I know, right?

343
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:46,727
Just a few things I stole
to help fill the void.

344
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:49,772
La mega ukulele.

345
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:53,985
Checkin' out my can?

346
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,529
We stole that
because finally someone expressed

347
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:58,406
my love of soup in painting form.

348
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,032
CAMPBELL'S CONDENSED
TOMATO SOUP

349
00:36:00,116 --> 00:36:03,619
Okay, listen up!
It is time to get down to business.

350
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,330
Do you know who this is?

351
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:12,336
This is Queen Elizabeth, ruler of England.

352
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:15,339
I love England.

353
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,550
The music, the fashion.

354
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:20,094
I'm seriously thinking
about overthrowing it someday.

355
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:25,975
Anyway, this pale drink of water
oversees it all.

356
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,685
I'm her biggest fan.

357
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,103
I love her work.

358
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:31,772
And I really, really,
really want her crown.

359
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:39,155
Steal me the crown
and all your dreams come true.

360
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,782
Respect! Power!

361
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,034
Banana!

362
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:45,077
Banana!

363
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,131
Henry!

364
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,175
No! Oh, no.

365
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,510
Don't get too close, boys.

366
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,804
When it's completed,
it'll be my ultimate weapon.

367
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:47,348
But right now, it's leaking radiation

368
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:49,141
like you would not believe!

369
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,729
So, you're here for gear.

370
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,403
Bob, Robert, Bobby, my boy.

371
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:04,365
You get my far-out stretch suit.

372
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:10,121
Kevin, Kev-bo, Seventh Kevin,

373
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,708
you are the proud owner
of my lava lamp gun.

374
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:16,877
This baby shoots actual lava!

375
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:19,797
Pretty cool, right?

376
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:25,094
Finally, Stu. Stu-art,
Stu-perman, Beef Stu.

377
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,888
I got you the coolest invention,
probably ever.

378
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:31,559
Hypno-hat!

379
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,776
You can use it to hypnotize anyone.

380
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,153
Anyone!

381
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,947
You look so great!

382
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:48,826
I feel like a proud mama
with three dashing evil sons.

383
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,874
No, no. Don't say anything.
I won't understand.

384
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:58,961
It's getting late. You've had a big day,
you must be exhausted!

385
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,551
Wow! These cats are pumped!

386
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:09,805
Well, maybe I'll settle them down
with a bedtime story?

387
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:18,564
How does that sound, Bob? Bob. Bob! Bob!

388
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,316
Bedtime porry?

389
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:23,652
That is a groovy idea!
I'll go get some cookies and warm milk.

390
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:26,614
This is gonna be so fun!

391
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:33,579
Yes, I've got a really, really good
bedtime porry.

392
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:37,833
Once upon a time,
there were three little pigs.

393
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,087
One fateful day,

394
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:44,757
the pigs encountered a big, bad wolf

395
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:48,719
who had a wonderful surprise for them!

396
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,263
The wolf offered the three piggies

397
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:54,016
and all their friends
a job working for her.

398
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,644
Everyone would be so happy!

399
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:01,649
All the three little piggies had to do
was just steal one little crown

400
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,359
that the beautiful wolf had wanted

401
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:06,612
ever since she was
a penniless little street cub,

402
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:10,282
unloved and abandoned.

403
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:14,495
But that crown would mean
she was a princess,

404
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,872
and everybody loves a princess!

405
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:19,250
So the wolf sent the piggies
to get that crown.

406
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,879
But the little pigs
weren't up to the challenge.

407
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,965
They failed their mission.

408
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:29,593
So the wolf huffed and puffed,

409
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:32,430
and she blew them off
the face of the earth!

410
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:39,770
The end.

411
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:46,902
Good luck getting that crown tomorrow,
little piggies.

412
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:50,364
I know you won't disappoint me.

413
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:02,251

416
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:13,345
Which way is the loo, please? Thank you.

417
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:19,602
Hello, tres, please.

418
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:24,106
You're not allowed in without an adult.
Scram, hooligans!

419
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:43,751
How many tickets, please?

420
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:46,462
Tres, please.

421
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,590
Uno, please. Uno!

422
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,306
Enjoy yourself, love.

423
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:58,599
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

424
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,229
It was nowhere near Hyde Park!

425
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,231
Bob's your uncle.

426
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,862
STRICTLY PROHIBITED
KEEP OUT

427
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:27,044
Hey! What are you doing here?

428
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:31,590
This is a restricted area!

429
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:32,967
Hands in the air!

430
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:35,636
Let me do it.

431
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:41,392
Stop that!

432
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,438
Get back.

433
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:08,854
So, you came for
the Queen's crown, did you?

434
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:12,066
Well, you're gonna have to get through me!

435
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,401
The Keeper of the Crown!

436
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:24,203
You think it's funny
to mock the elderly, do you?

437
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:25,954
Si.

438
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:28,248
I've been up here for decades,

439
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:32,795
just waiting for someone to try
and steal the Queen's treasure!

440
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:40,135
What are you saying?
Never mind, don't care!

441
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:48,102
No, you don't!

442
00:44:50,687 --> 00:44:51,522
Flippin' heck!

00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:02,533
Bob, break glass.

00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,640
La corona.

445
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:33,355
La corona. Speed up.

446
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:34,606
Hello!

447
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:56,211
Hello!

448
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:58,964
-Stone the crows!
-Stop him, lads! Wait!

449
00:45:59,047 --> 00:45:59,882
Go for the legs!

No!

456
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:55,020
Gentlemen do not steal ladies' crowns!

457
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:19,753
Oh, dear!

458
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:36,353
You scoundrel! After them!

459
00:47:40,524 --> 00:47:41,400
Stop the blighter!

One of England's most famous myths
has become a reality

as a new king has been crowned.

466
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:13,557
Bob, who appears to be
a bald, jaundiced child,

467
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:16,351
has pulled the famed sword
right from its stone,

468
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:19,104
which, legend dictates,
makes him the new king.

I feel used. Not gonna lie.

You stole my dream!
I was going to conquer England someday!

495
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:38,697
There was gonna be a coronation,
and I was going to be made Queen.

496
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:40,574
Every moment was planned.

497
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:44,160
I'd wear a dress so sparkly, it glowed!

498
00:52:44,452 --> 00:52:48,665
And everyone who ever doubted me
would be watching,

499
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:51,042
and they would be crying!

500
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:55,213
I was going to be
the picture of elegance and class!

501
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:58,049
And you pinheads screwed it up!

502
00:52:58,133 --> 00:52:59,718
No, no! La corona, para tu.

503
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:04,973
No, no, no, King Bob!
You cannot just abdicate the throne!

504
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,267
Who invited the square?

505
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:10,645
And you definitely cannot
just give the job to this woman!

506
00:53:11,187 --> 00:53:12,480
There are laws!

507
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:23,783
King Bob has officially changed the law,

508
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:27,370
clearing the way for Scarlet Overkill
to be crowned Queen of England!

509
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:30,790
She will be coronated
at London's historic Westminster Abbey.

510
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:34,878
If I wasn't so polite, I'd say this spells
certain doom for the country,

511
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:36,254
if not the world.

512
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:39,841
But I'm so very polite
that I shall keep my mouth shut.

513
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:42,802
But, seriously, we're all in big trouble.

514
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:44,930
Scarlet! Scarlet!

515
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:47,974
I don't have time to answer any questions.

516
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:49,768
I just want to thank the Minions

517
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:52,729
for going above
and beyond the call of duty.

518
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:58,443
You are three tiny, golden,
pill-shaped miracle workers,

519
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:03,281
and you have stolen
not just England but my heart.

520
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:04,532
Scarlet, over here!

521
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:08,286
Pardon me?

522
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:09,204
La triba.

523
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:13,500
Wow! So many!

524
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:15,377
Good for you!

525
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:18,171
Well, you'll all get what you deserve.

526
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:51,997
Go ahead, go ahead.

527
00:55:03,299 --> 00:55:06,261
I don't want you to take this
the wrong way, but I hate you.

528
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:08,930
I thought I could get over what you did,

529
00:55:09,014 --> 00:55:11,141
but I feel so betrayed.

530
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:13,059
I think...

531
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:15,979
Yes, I think we're gonna have to break up.

532
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:17,689
And it's not you.

533
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:22,527
Wait, hold on. It is you. It's 100% you!

534
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:28,158
So get comfortable, Minions.
Get real, real comfortable.

535
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:30,952
Because this is where
you're going to spend

536
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:35,040
the rest of your worthless little lives.

537
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:40,420
All right! Let's do this!

538
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:44,674
Who's this handsome "Herb" fella?

539
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:48,303
No, my name is "Blerb."
I'm a dungeon master.

540
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:51,139
Prepare for torture, which I do!

541
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:57,520
All right, are we comfy?
Doesn't matter! This is torture!

542
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:07,238
Wow! Harder than I thought. Next machine!

543
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:09,991
Welcome to Hang Town!

544
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:12,327
Population, you!

545
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:22,212
Cut it out! This is really unprofessional!

546
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:23,922
There's no laughing in the dungeon!

547
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:26,466
I wanna see tears
and I wanna hear screams,

548
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:28,426
or I'm gonna get... Wait!

549
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,471
I've got a groovy idea!

550
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:34,808
Look at this!

551
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:45,568
Hello! Will the future king,
Herb Overkill,

552
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:47,862
please come upstairs
to prepare for the coronation?

553
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:50,198
Well, I hope you learned
your lesson for today.

554
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:52,909
And by the way,

555
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:55,120
it was me, Herb,

556
00:56:55,411 --> 00:56:56,454
the whole time!

557
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:00,708
I don't even know anyone named "Blerb"!

558
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:10,301
I am hours away from becoming
the Queen of England!

559
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:12,262
I know! It's a gas!

560
00:57:12,428 --> 00:57:14,347
-I will finally get my crown.
-Yeah.

561
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:15,890
It's all I've ever wanted.

562
00:57:15,974 --> 00:57:18,101
I'm going to be so happy.

563
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:21,855
But let me ask you something, Fabrice.

564
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:25,483
Does that look like this to you?

565
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:28,903
Mrs. Overkill,

566
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,239
the hair in that picture,

567
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:33,324
it's just two wavy lines!

568
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:35,994
So, what, now you're an art critic?

569
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:38,621
I drew that when I was five years old!

570
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:40,707
Get out of my sight!

571
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:45,920
Bye, Fabrice!

572
00:57:46,588 --> 00:57:48,465
I liked him. He was fun.

573
00:57:49,382 --> 00:57:50,800
So, what do you think of the dress?

574
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:52,927
It's so beautiful.

575
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:56,973
So fashion-forward. So Valentino.

576
00:57:57,515 --> 00:57:59,893
Gave it a sweetheart neckline
because you're my sweetheart.

577
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:04,105
The high collar and cinched waist
reflect a simpler, more violent time.

578
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:07,692
The material is a blend of taffeta
and high-density body armor.

579
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:09,110
Fully armed and loaded.

580
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:13,323
And that glow, that's nuclear.

581
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:15,700
Nice. Just one more thing to do.

582
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:17,494
Gotta look good for the public.

583
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:20,747
-Do you mind?
-My pleasure.

584
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:25,543
Little tighter, sweetie.
Come on, I can take it.

585
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:27,045
Little tighter.

586
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:29,214
Tighter!

587
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,717
Must have tiny waist.

588
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:35,261
Seeing stars, seeing stars!

589
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:38,056
Losing feeling in my legs. Perfect!

590
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:39,390
Tie it, tie it, tie it, tie it.

591
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:57,283
CARNABY STREET
BIG BEN

592
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:00,995
GOD SAVE
THE QUEEN

593
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:14,133
SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS

594
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,017
Hey, Kevin, look

595
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,227
para la Scarlet.

596
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:33,695
SORRY
SCARLET

597
00:59:41,786 --> 00:59:42,704
ABBEY

598
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:05,101
I love you, Scarlet!

599
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:09,147
Queen wave, queen wave! Queen waving!

600
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:20,867
I am so, so excited! This is perfect!

601
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:23,202
Everyone looks so nice!

602
01:00:23,995 --> 01:00:26,623
You are just adorable!

603
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:29,792
Yes!

604
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:31,294
And that music.

605
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:35,590
Who is that organist? She is good! Right?

606
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:36,758
She looks like an Edna.

607
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:39,719
-Edna, you are very good!
-Who was that?

608
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,100
Thanks for doing this, padre. Big fan.

609
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:48,269
Come here, let me squeeze you!

610
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:50,313
You are so squishy!

611
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:56,462
Will you to your power

612
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:59,257
cause law and justice...

613
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:21,237
In mercy...

614
01:02:27,034 --> 01:02:29,203
Do you, Scarlet Overkill...

615
01:03:04,655 --> 01:03:08,117
I proclaim thee, Scarlet Overkill,

616
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:10,286
the Queen of England!

617
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:15,208
Kevin!

618
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:24,801
Scarlet! Scarlet, my queen?

619
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:27,053
Somebody help me!

620
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:30,848
Come on, come on! Lift on two.

621
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:33,559
One, two!

622
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:35,436
One, two!

623
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:48,282
Scarlet! You're okay!

624
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,202
He tried to kill me!

625
01:03:53,454 --> 01:03:56,207
Villains, this is no longer a coronation!

626
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:58,584
It is an execution!

627
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:00,127
Get them!

628
01:04:05,132 --> 01:04:08,094
Whoa, Nelly! Run, fellas, run!

629
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:15,434
Come back here, you!

630
01:04:53,681 --> 01:04:54,807
You're mine!

631
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:16,245
Hey! I got one!

632
01:05:56,994 --> 01:05:57,828
Stuart?

633
01:05:58,245 --> 01:05:59,080
Bob?

634
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:07,171
Mind the gap.

635
01:06:09,507 --> 01:06:10,716
Mind the gap.

636
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:16,263
Mind the gap.

637
01:06:18,516 --> 01:06:19,725
PIG'S SPLEEN
SINCE 1967

638
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:22,019
-He won't get away!
-He won't escape us!

639
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:30,820
What about this one?

640
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:34,156
Why did the queen go to the dentist?

641
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:36,659
To get her teeth crowned.

642
01:06:39,453 --> 01:06:41,247
Tell us another one, Lizzy!

643
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:45,418
It's you.

644
01:06:45,918 --> 01:06:48,796
Everyone, this is
one of the little fellows

645
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:50,715
who stole the monarchy from me.

646
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:53,300
And how's that working out for you?

647
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:58,639
Yes, yes, I saw what was
going on on the telly.

648
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:00,683
BREAKING NEWS

649
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:03,019
What was meant to be
the coronation of Scarlet Overkill

650
01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:04,687
has gone terribly wrong as--

651
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:05,604
Move!

652
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:10,693
Kevin, Kevin, I know you're out there.

653
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:12,611
You think you've gotten away?

654
01:07:12,778 --> 01:07:15,406
Well, what do we have here?

655
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:17,992
-Oh, my goodness!
-Bob? Stuart?

656
01:07:18,075 --> 01:07:20,244
Which one shall I kill first?

657
01:07:20,661 --> 01:07:22,955
Little Bob? Stuart?

658
01:07:23,539 --> 01:07:25,958
Bob! Stuart!

659
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:30,755
I will do it, Kevin,
if you are not back here by dawn!

660
01:07:32,173 --> 01:07:33,841
-Oh, my!
-No!

661
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:54,987
There he is!

662
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:04,747
Follow me!

663
01:08:17,885 --> 01:08:19,929
Harder! It's just my head.

664
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:26,018
-This way! Let's get him!
-Go, go, go!

665
01:08:41,283 --> 01:08:42,493
DO NOT
PUSH THIS BUTTON

666
01:08:43,828 --> 01:08:44,662
DO NOT
FLIP THIS SWITCH

667
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:48,332
DO NOT
PULL THIS LEVER!

668
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:54,964
DO NOT
BLOW IN THIS HOLE

669
01:08:55,047 --> 01:08:56,423
Ultimate weapon initiated.

670
01:08:56,674 --> 01:09:00,886
Activation in three, two, one.

671
01:09:38,299 --> 01:09:39,133
TNT

672
01:09:41,218 --> 01:09:42,303
This is it, boys!

673
01:09:43,053 --> 01:09:45,222
Things do not look good for you.

674
01:09:46,098 --> 01:09:47,099
And I'm keeping the bear.

675
01:09:48,642 --> 01:09:50,436
You're not gonna need him
where you're going.

676
01:09:51,395 --> 01:09:52,438
Heaven.

677
01:10:07,828 --> 01:10:10,581
Bye-bye. Say bye-bye, Bob. Bye-bye!

678
01:10:50,704 --> 01:10:52,581
Wait, what? How did he...

679
01:10:53,749 --> 01:10:54,750
Hold my bear.

680
01:11:24,321 --> 01:11:25,614
So, that's your plan?

681
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:27,825
Make yourself a bigger target?

682
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:37,126
Kevin?

683
01:12:04,028 --> 01:12:04,945
And so help me,

684
01:12:05,029 --> 01:12:09,366
I never wanna see another one of
your goofy, bug-eyed faces ever again!

685
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:11,410
What?

686
01:12:12,369 --> 01:12:13,412
-Scarlet!
-Scarlet!

687
01:12:13,495 --> 01:12:14,913
You've gotta be kidding me!

688
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:19,585
No, you don't!

689
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,763
And just for the record,
my little deviled eggs,

690
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:33,974
you can thank Kevin
for what I'm about to do to you!

691
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:35,684
GOD SAVE THE QUEEN

692
01:12:38,062 --> 01:12:42,524
QUEEN FIASCO!

693
01:12:50,532 --> 01:12:51,367
You the man!

694
01:12:53,118 --> 01:12:54,119
Buddies!

695
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:55,871
Mazel tov.

696
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:12,638
Enough!

697
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:16,850
This ends now!

698
01:13:45,754 --> 01:13:48,507
You imbecile! Have fun exploding!

699
01:13:49,091 --> 01:13:49,925
Baby!

700
01:13:51,051 --> 01:13:53,095
-What's the rush?
-Got to get out of here!

701
01:13:54,721 --> 01:13:57,099
Let us go!

702
01:14:05,315 --> 01:14:07,067
No, no, no, no!

703
01:15:45,249 --> 01:15:46,083
Stuart?

704
01:15:46,833 --> 01:15:47,960
-Bob?
-Si.

705
01:15:50,796 --> 01:15:51,630
Okay.

706
01:16:05,769 --> 01:16:07,563
Ladies and gentlemen,

707
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:12,317
we are here today
to celebrate the Minions!

708
01:16:18,156 --> 01:16:21,201
The country owes you
a great debt of gratitude.

709
01:16:22,619 --> 01:16:27,499
Bob, you were a wise and noble king
for all of eight hours.

710
01:16:28,208 --> 01:16:33,505
So for you, I offer this tiny crown
for your teddy bear, Tim.

711
01:16:37,968 --> 01:16:38,844
Very good, Bob!

712
01:16:41,346 --> 01:16:42,681
Spectacular!

713
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:45,726
I'm so proud of you boys!

714
01:16:47,227 --> 01:16:48,061
Stuart.

715
01:16:49,187 --> 01:16:52,065
For you, I have this beautiful,

716
01:16:52,566 --> 01:16:54,776
super-duper, incredible

717
01:16:55,736 --> 01:16:56,612
snow globe!

718
01:16:59,698 --> 01:17:02,367
And look, look, hours of excitement!

719
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:07,664
Gracias.

720
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:13,295
Stuart, we're just messing with you!

721
01:17:14,421 --> 01:17:17,424
Don't be mad at me, it was Kevin's idea.

722
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:22,429
We have a much better surprise for you!

723
01:17:23,388 --> 01:17:24,973
Super, mega ukulele.

724
01:18:04,429 --> 01:18:05,263
Right.

725
01:18:06,431 --> 01:18:08,392
And finally, Kevin!

726
01:18:11,395 --> 01:18:14,356
You are a hero of the highest order.

727
01:18:15,023 --> 01:18:17,275
For your bravery and valor,

728
01:18:17,901 --> 01:18:19,069
I am knighting you.

729
01:18:19,986 --> 01:18:23,156
From here on out, you are Sir Kevin.

730
01:18:24,282 --> 01:18:25,325
Well done.

731
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:37,421
What a beautiful moment!

732
01:18:40,257 --> 01:18:45,053
The nation, nay, the world was celebrating
Kevin, Stuart and Bob.

733
01:18:45,595 --> 01:18:47,681
The last few thousand years were rough,

734
01:18:47,764 --> 01:18:48,724
no question,

735
01:18:48,807 --> 01:18:51,935
but things were finally going their way!

736
01:18:53,061 --> 01:18:55,522
Kevin had never been more proud.

737
01:18:56,857 --> 01:18:58,525
But something was missing.

738
01:18:59,192 --> 01:19:01,319
Yes, good show, good show!

739
01:19:03,113 --> 01:19:05,449
My crown is gone! It's gone!

740
01:19:06,116 --> 01:19:06,950
Blimey!

741
01:19:07,033 --> 01:19:08,869
-She's lost the crown!
-Oh, my days!

742
01:19:13,707 --> 01:19:14,541
Scarlet?

743
01:19:20,422 --> 01:19:21,923
They took everything from me!

744
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:24,050
My castle! My reputation!

745
01:19:24,551 --> 01:19:27,095
Things look bleak, baby,
I'm not gonna lie!

746
01:19:27,345 --> 01:19:30,849
But now at least I have my crown!

747
01:19:45,155 --> 01:19:47,365
Child, give me that back.

748
01:19:48,158 --> 01:19:51,119
No, I don't think so!

749
01:19:51,244 --> 01:19:54,289
You have no idea who you're messing with!

750
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:57,542
I am the greatest
super-villain of all time!

751
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:00,420
Were you?

752
01:20:09,095 --> 01:20:10,680
Buddies, come here. Come here!

753
01:20:11,306 --> 01:20:12,182
Looka!

754
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:30,992
New boss!

755
01:20:32,035 --> 01:20:35,205
Get back! Are you really going to
allow that little penguin

756
01:20:35,288 --> 01:20:37,916
to make off with my crown?

757
01:20:40,252 --> 01:20:41,086
Herb.

758
01:20:42,087 --> 01:20:43,171
I'm done.

759
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:49,010
For me?

760
01:20:50,762 --> 01:20:51,763
Si, para tu.

761
01:20:53,139 --> 01:20:53,974
Bye-bye.

762
01:20:54,641 --> 01:20:56,017
New boss!

763
01:20:58,562 --> 01:21:02,649
And that is how the Minions
found their new boss.

764
01:21:02,983 --> 01:21:06,236
He was cunning,
he was evil, he was perfect.

765
01:21:06,611 --> 01:21:09,948
He was despicable.

766
01:23:32,257 --> 01:23:33,633
-Gru. Gru. Gru.
-Gru. Gru. Gru.

767
01:29:55,515 --> 01:29:57,141
Hey! Come back here!

768
01:30:44,063 --> 01:30:44,897
Freeze ray!
