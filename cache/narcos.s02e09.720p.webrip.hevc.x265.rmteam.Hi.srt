What did you tell them?

00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,250
The truth.

15
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,800
That I haven't seen you in years.

16
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,220
You've gotten old, Pablo.

[Latin guitar theme music plays]

34
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:51,210
[Steve] I read in a book somewhere
about a rich guy who goes broke.

35
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:56,720
When he's asked how it happened,
how he had lost everything, he answered:

36
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:02,520
"Slowly at first.
And then... all at once."

37
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,350
For Pablo Escobar,
"all at once" had finally come.

38
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:12,840
His empire in shambles,
his army all dead or in jail,

39
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:17,820
Escobar did the one thing
he could still do: a disappearing act.

40
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,530
One month, 14 days and seven hours...

41
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:26,120
with no sightings, no intercepts, nothing.

42
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:30,350
While we waited
for his eventual reemergence,

43
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,250
the machine built to capture him
found itself idle.

44
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:37,090
And that brought
a different kind of danger.

One that comes
with too much time to think.

and how do I get clean?"

[in Spanish]
It is the state, not individuals,

49

[Steve]
Under mounting political pressure,

51
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:03,580
Gaviria finally publicly denounced
Los Pepes.

52
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:07,160
And Los Pepes responded
with their own press release.

53
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,850
They said their job was done.

54
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,500
They were packing up and going home.

55
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:16,510
But Los Pepes wasn't something
you could turn on and off.

56
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,190
Its members were looking to the future.

57
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:23,260
One without Escobar.
And they each had their own version of it.

58
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,910
Los Pepes had knocked Pablo
out of the narco business

59
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:30,950
and that had created a vacancy
for a new cocaine king of Medellín.

60
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:34,880
Or, depending on who you asked,
maybe a queen.

63
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,720
They issued a statement without us.

00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,700
Los Pepes is done.

65
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:50,180
That's only for show.
The Castaños are still in Medellín.

If Escobar comes through that door,
we'll kill him ourselves.

But if Gilberto finds out, what then?

00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:13,350
Did you know they're offering
$1.4 million for Los Pepes?

75
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,730
I know where they are.

That's a dangerous thought, Judy.

I'm not interested in the reward.

What do you want us to do?
Where do we send it?

we can keep all of it.

What? I thought we were going home.
We don't know anything about cocaine.

00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,120
We'll learn.

96
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,600
If they can, why not us?

97
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,900
And what about Judy? Hmm?

98
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,780
Judy feels Medellín
is only big enough for one narco.

99
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:48,130
We'll let the Castaños decide which one.

[Steve] Los Pepes may have disbanded,
but that didn't mean they were done.

00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,170
The story of a vigilante army taking down
Escobar made for great headlines.

And while no one was named, it's not
to say it wasn't cause for concern.

This article's getting more traction
than we thought.

110
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,800

want a statement from the ambassador.

111

- Are we giving one?
- No. Nobody is.

112
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,430
But we're watching it closely.

113
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:35,310
I don't need to tell you
it could look very bad for us.

114
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:36,770
I want to make sure we're covered.

115
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,180
Well, Los Pepes is disbanded.
It's basically over.

116
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:43,440
Look, I tend to agree. But the press may
shake a few more trees, see what falls.

What if someone talks?

The only people that are gonna
talk about Los Pepes is Los Pepes.

How many people do we have
in the laboratories?

- Forty-five in each one.
- How many supervisors?

Three in each.

I'm busy. I can't talk.

There's been an attempt on Judy.

142

She's saying a few things
you might want to hear.

143
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,430
Give me time.

144
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,230
What's going on?

145
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,480
Nothing that's my problem anymore.

146
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,480
Where you going?

147
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,650
I just want to make sure.

148
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:35,990
Fuck it. I don't want to know.

149
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,670
- Peña.
- [in Spanish] Mr. Peña has arrived.

150
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,300
Let's go. Search.

151
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:25,480
Kiko and I built all of this together.
This is all that is left for me.

152
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,270
What are the Castaños thinking?
That they can chase me out?

153
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,110
I'm not leaving.

154
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:34,220
They don't want you to leave,
they want to kill you.

155
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:40,310
And what about you?
You're in this with me too.

156
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:51,920
Look... you brought these guys here.
You got in bed with Cali.

157
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,130
This is all your doing.

158
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:57,090
This is a fight between narcos.
It's not my problem.

159
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,990
Don't call me again.

160
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:04,680

intelligence is a federal offense.

00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:07,980
Especially when it ends up
in the hands of a death squad

162
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,560
that's killed innocent people.

163
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:14,670
I'm sure some newspaper in America might
be interested in hearing more about that.

164
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,530
Are you threatening me?

165
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,680
Yes, I'm threatening you.

166
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:30,360
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

167
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,790
What do you want?

168
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,530
You're a cop.

169
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,760
You know perfectly well
where Montecasino is.

170
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:42,490
Where the Castaños are,
and the Rodriguezes.

171
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:44,790
Arrest them.

172
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,670
And when you do,
accidentally shoot them in the head.

173
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,550
- It doesn't work that way.
- Oh, no? Then how?

174
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,930
We'll do it my way.

175
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,960
[Berna]
So you want Judy to be a rat?

176
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,650
I don't agree with this, Javier.

177
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,150
We are narcos, but we have our honor.

178
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:22,160
Berna... you're a fucking drug dealer
who sells poison by the kilo.

179
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,600
Fuck your honor.

180
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,870
[soft chuckle]

181
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,520
Says you.

182
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:33,170
You've been happily working
with the information we've provided.

183
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:36,300
And what have you done?

184
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:41,050
If you have a better idea, go for it.

185
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:44,740
Otherwise, this is the deal.

186
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,180
Judy becomes a confidential informant
to the DEA.

187
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:50,600
She gives us Cali, everything she knows.

188
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:56,570
If you don't like it,
you can take on the Castaños alone.

189
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,450
[in English]
And you can go fuck yourself.

190
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,550
[Steve]
Best way to make a bad story go away

191
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,330
is to come up with a better story...

192
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,750
and sell it hard.

193
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:11,430
This is one of the cornerstones
of American foreign policy,

194
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:15,150
and one we learned through years
of trial and error in Latin America,

195
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:18,770
Chile, Guatemala, Panama.

196
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,360
Getting caught with your pants down sucks,

197
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,990
but if at the same time
you give the folks a big win,

198
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:28,580
like, say, dismantling the second biggest
drug cartel in the world,

199
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,580
well, then nobody's paying attention
to the bad story.

200
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,960
They're too busy patting you on the back.

201
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:39,290
Risky plan? Yes.
But pressure will force you to take risks.

202
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,670
It'll force you to do a lot of things.

203
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:44,370
[in Spanish] We haven't heard anything
from him for weeks.

204
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,800
We don't even know where he is.

205
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:50,600
[Hermilda] I don't know why
you're letting De Greiff come here.

206
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,410
He's coming to scare you.

207
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,600
And now you're losing faith in Pablo.

208
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:58,800
[gentle scoff]
You don't understand, do you?

209
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,280
We don't have any more money, Hermilda.

210
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,240
If they take our protection away,
we can't do anything else.

211
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,870
Pablo has many properties.
Don't be so dramatic, Tata.

212
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:13,370
You think someone
is going to invest in us?

213
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,520
They're going to give us their money?

214
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,610
No one is going to help us.

215
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,950
Everyone knows what that would mean.

216
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,420
Whatever he's doing...

217
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:46,050
wherever my son is,
he's doing it for his family.

218
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,800
Don't forget that.

219
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:20,670
[softly] Pablo? Pablo?
Can you hear me, Pablo? Please answer.

[Miguel] That's a lot of product for men
who don't know how to run this business.

231
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:09,880
We have to be clear with them.
Their work isn't done.

232
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,110
Our donation to them is an advance.

233
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,840
Besides, we have to keep them happy.

234
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:19,640
Their connection with the Americans
is invaluable, brother.

00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:21,680
What a fucking joke,

236

the CIA and their war
against the communists.

237

It's a joke, but that friendship
could save our lives one day.

What? Any news about Judy?

239

The Castaños took their first shot,
a bomb. But they didn't kill her.

240
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:42,540
Since when did it get so fucking hard
to kill someone?

241
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,830
What about her assistant?
The fat one, what do they call him? Berna?

242
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,920
He's the one we should kill.
She's just a loud-mouth bitch.

He says he may have a lead, man.

Yeah, well, why don't you, uh,
give it to Martinez?

Or you could give it
to your Los Pepes pals.

This is a tier-one narco who's
ready to flip on other tier-one narcos.

318
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:13,470
She's been in the business for 30 years.
She knows Cali's operation.

319
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:16,310
It's not Intel anyone can provide.

320
00:26:16,330 --> 00:26:17,710
She has leverage over you.

321
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:22,810
Her information on Escobar
crippled his business.

322
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,130
She'll do the same to Cali,
only this time for us.

323
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:29,300
The moment she goes on record,
her leverage is gone.

324
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,870
She doesn't get immunity
until after she talks.

325
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:40,230
Get her on record
and we'll see what she's got.

326
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:42,940
Nobody seems to want to take on Cali.

327
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:46,110
They've been off-limits,
but this may do the trick.

328
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:50,380
And Peña. Be discreet. Tell no one.

329
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:53,160
There are people in this building
who won't like it.

330
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:03,290
[elevator dings, doors opening]

331
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:05,550
[Bill]
Going down?

332
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,840
[clears throat]

333
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:18,140
So... how's it going?

334
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,190
[buzzing]

335
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:38,450
[cows mooing]

336
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,270
[father]
What are you doing, Pablo?

337
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:49,880
[chuckles]
You don't know how to tie a knot.

338
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:02,350
This is a cowboy's knot.
This is really good.

339
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,930
[indistinct chatter in Spanish]

340
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:22,160

[father chuckles]

342
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:40,950
[man] Wanted: Pablo Escobar.
Reward 2,700,000 pesos.

343
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:45,450
Call for free from any city
at 9-800-10-600.

344
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:51,480
In Bogotá, 222-50-12.
In Medellín, 461-11-11.

345
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:38,070
[birds calling]

346
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:53,760
The kids would love to be here.

347
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,220
I've been thinking...

348
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:07,060
I could buy some land here next to you.

349
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,190
Some cows, maybe some sheep.

350
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,610
And have my own farm.

351
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,840
We could run it together.

352
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:44,060
What do you think?

353
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:02,570
We need to finish putting up the wire.

354
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,510
Do you remember when the soldiers
came to our village?

355
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,510
You were a tough little boy,
probably only seven or eight years old.

356
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:32,400
But even in that moment,
you were already the man of the house.

357
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:40,250
In the face of all that
violence and death, you were strong.

358
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,910
You are a survivor.

359
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,630
A man of action.

360
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:50,910
I knew that day you were destined
for great things, Pablo.

361
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:55,440
- [Martinez in Spanish] Good evening.
- [men] Colonel.

362
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,750
Sit.

363
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:02,280
So, did you decipher those codes?
Are they real?

364
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,070
Yes, Colonel. I verified the frequencies.

365
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,360
The codes are the same ones
Escobar's wife is using.

366
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:11,540
- He'll use them when he calls her.
- Did you confirm it's Escobar?

367
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:12,560
Did you hear him?

368
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,360
No, Colonel, not yet.

369
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:19,380
[in English] All right, say he picks up
the phone. How close can we get?

370
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,010
If Pablo talks in Medellín,
we'll know every word he says.

371
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:26,570
- Can you get his exact location?
- If it's within range, yes.

372
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:31,970
All right, if Pablo uses the phone
outside of Medellín with the same codes,

373
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,210
can you hear him?

374
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:38,880
No. The antenna is not that strong.

375
00:33:01,610 --> 00:33:06,530
Why didn't you answer me when I asked
about me coming here with my family?

376
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:09,740
I wasn't paying that much attention.

377
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,040
But you're paying attention to me now,
right?

378
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,790
So, what do you think?

379
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:24,300
- It's a nice idea.
- Yes, it's a nice idea.

380
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:30,140
It's a nice idea, now help me.
Put that bucket down here.

381
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:39,440
Now hold on to the pig.

382
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,610
Fuck!

383
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:48,530
[father]
Funny that you don't like blood.

384
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,780
How strange.

385
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,620
What are you trying to say?

386
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,710
Clean yourself.

387
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,220
[soft chuckle]

388
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,970
You know what's funny?

389
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:20,610
That my dad...

390
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:27,740
has no fucking idea who I am.

391
00:34:29,990 --> 00:34:33,240
- I know very well who you are.
- Mmm.

392
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:39,640
Did you know that I was
one of the world's richest men?

393
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,890
Is that right?

394
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,150
You know the President
of the United States knows who I am?

395
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:46,760
- The United States? Disgusting.
- Mmm.

396
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:52,610
I was elected to the
House of Representatives of this country.

397
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:57,100
Your last name is known throughout
the whole world because of what I did.

398
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:01,370
- So what? So what? So what?!
- So what?!

399
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,190
And what about you? What about you?!

400
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:13,590
Ignorant old man. Who lives alone.

401
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:16,410
On this shithole farm.

402
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,170
Who doesn't know his own grandchildren.

403
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:25,340
Not even one fucking picture of them here.

404
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,900
Mmm.

405
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,930
So I'm nothing more than
an ignorant old man?

406
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,260
That's right.

407
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:43,230
Now tell me... [shaky chuckle]

408
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,070
Tell me...

409
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:50,530
what you think of me.

410
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,640
- Who cares?
- I do.

411
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,350
[drops knife]

412
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:01,410
It's important to me.

413
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:08,460
You wanted to come live on this farm
with your wife and kids.

414
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:12,760
But that's not possible, Pablo.

415
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,680
You chose your life!

416
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,140
Be in charge of it.

417
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,520
You want me to tell you
what I think of you?

418
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,520
I'm ashamed.

419
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:34,160
I think you're a murderer.

420
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,250
At last, the truth.

421
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:48,000
At last, the truth.

422
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:51,510
[voice quavers] A truth...

423
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,350
that breaks my heart.

424
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,190
Leave me alone.

425
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,100
Limón.

426
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,140
Yes, sir?

427
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:52,420
You like it here, right?

428
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,480
[soft chuckle]

429
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:56,030
Yes, boss. It's a peaceful place.

430
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:59,160
[whispers] Peaceful.

00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,120
Kneel down.

433
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:22,970
A few kilometers from here, in a field,
you will find a big tree.

434
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:27,940
Under that tree is a buried case of money.

435
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,370
Go get it.

436
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,650
Are we leaving, boss?

437
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,030
[softly] Yes.

438
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,190
Go on.

[De Greiff]
That's correct, Mrs. Escobar.

441
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:02,900
How long did you think this arrangement
was going to last?

442
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:06,240
[Tata] Do you not realize that if
we leave here, they're going to kill us?

443
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:13,080
If you desire, you have the right
to contract private security services.

444
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:16,630
Tell us how. We don't have a dime.

445
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:21,130
That is not our problem.
Mrs. Escobar, I'm sorry.

446
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,450
You're sorry?

447
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,010
Then help us find asylum
in another country.

448
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:30,060
I don't have an issue with you
leaving Colombia. But...

449
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,040
But you can't help us find asylum.

00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:39,840
That's bullshit!

452
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:42,300
They're going to...

453
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:44,680
[whispers] ...kill us all.

[whispers] Nothing, my love.

I'm sorry, Attorney General...

457
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,160
but I don't know what else to do.

458
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:23,400
If you're in contact with your husband,
I advise you to express your concern.

459
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:25,340
Tell him to surrender.

460
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:30,930
The power of the law is your last hope.

461
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:34,100
Think about your children.

Shit.

- No. [whines]
- Yes, before you go to sleep.

Jhon. What are you doing here?

471
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:35,180
Where is the money?
The money we gave you. I need it back.

472
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,890
We spent it. It's gone.

473
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:40,750
Relax. I'm not going to hurt you.

474
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:46,590
You've already hurt me.

475
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,720
You fucked up my life.

476

I want to put the baby in her crib.
Can I put her down?

477
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:03,900
Hang on, Maritza.

478
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:22,790
And this?

479
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:30,980
That's all we have, Jhon.
It's all we have. We need it.

480
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:35,320
Please, don't take it. Please.
It's for the baby, please!

481
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:39,070
You lying... bitch! Get off!

482
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,950
Motherfucker! Bastard!

483
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:45,790
I should turn you in for the reward!
You deserve it!

484
00:44:45,810 --> 00:44:49,530
- Sooner or later, they'll find you anyway.
- [baby whimpering]

485
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:52,780
What did you say?

486
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:57,550
Are you going to say something? Hmm?
Are you going to rat on me?

487
00:44:57,570 --> 00:45:00,990
I might! Why shouldn't I?

488
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:07,710
What? So now you're a killer?
Like your hero? [spits]

489
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:10,210
Jhon!

490
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:13,690
I know you! Get that shit out...

491
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,630
- [gunshot]
- [gasps]

492
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:54,510
[turns off engine]

493
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:12,400
- Boss, I did what you asked.
- Show me.

494
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,550
But I have bad news.

495
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:17,610
- What happened?
- Look.

496
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,870
It's rotten, sir.

497
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:42,890
There was half a million dollars
in that fucking case.

498
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:55,080
This is what I could retrieve, sir.

499
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:57,610
There's about six thousand dollars.
I counted, boss.

500
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:11,210
Get your things. We're leaving.

501
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:15,980
[Judy] Remember, you and I
are partners in all this.

502
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,360
[Javier] Everything's set.
We have to do this tonight.

503
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:21,400
Where?

504
00:47:21,430 --> 00:47:23,510
It's a safe house in El Poblado.

505
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:25,470
We've used it before.

506
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,180
Berna knows where.

507
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:30,390
[Judy]
I'll see you there.

508
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:51,210
Everything is ready, Judy. Get in.

509
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:54,040
Let's go, Flaco.

510
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:03,470
[in English]
She's on her way.

511
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:11,850
[in Spanish]
I know what you're thinking.

512
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:17,940
I'm making a mistake. [chuckles]

513
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:23,170
You'll be taken care of
like you've taken care of me.

514
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,720
The only thing that needs to happen
is to get rid of the Cali cartel.

515
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:27,910
Up here, Flaco.

516
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:44,680
I can't protect a rat.

517
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:52,020
[static, stops]

518
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:05,320
I didn't think you'd betray me.

519
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:08,910
You were going to get yourself killed,
Judy.

520
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,640
So now, you're going to get on that plane.

521
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:15,640
And if I don't, what? What happens?

522
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:18,690
If you don't get on,
then you'll leave with the Castaños.

523
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:20,750
And I won't protect you anymore.

524
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,540
Tell me something.

525
00:49:54,870 --> 00:49:56,870
Did Cali arrange this?

526
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:01,940
How much did they offer you?
At least tell me that.

527
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:06,010
It's a mutual understanding.
I'll work with the Castaños.

528
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:11,570
They don't understand our business,
but they'll be useful in mine.

529
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:15,350
- So you fucked over your partner.
- I was never your partner.

530
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:18,150
I only protected your life.

531
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:24,250
Relax. You'll have money.

532
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:27,530
The Americans said they'd make sure
you had everything you need.

533
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:31,280
- Where am I going?
- Doesn't matter.

534
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:36,830
Go. And never come back to Colombia.

535
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:45,130
Don't worry about a thing.

536
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:51,510
You'll still be a rat, but for the CIA,
instead of the DEA.

537
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:16,370
[in English]
Hey, man. How's it going?

538
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,370
Everything good at the safe house?

539
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:23,250
- Where's Messina?
- Oh, she's gone.

540
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:27,150
Reassigned. Headed home.

541
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:31,240
Likely to spend the rest of her career
busting meth labs in Indianapolis.

542
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:33,570
Something about chain of command.

543
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,180
- And Judy?
- You didn't hear?

544
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:42,210
Judy has an interview
with the Miami Herald in, uh...

545
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:44,210
oh, about five hours.

546
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:48,250
Now I can't be certain,
but I bet she has a story to tell

547
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:52,490
about the involvement of a certain
DEA agent with Los Pepes.

548
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,850
All I know for sure is,
whatever Judy has to say,

549
00:51:57,870 --> 00:51:59,960
it won't be pointed in my direction.

550
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:03,210
You should've stayed in your lane.

551
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:05,500
[whispers] Wow.

552
00:52:06,750 --> 00:52:08,670
And Cali too, right?

553
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:11,880
They get a pass?

554
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:18,160
How much do they pay you
for your protection?

555
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:19,520
Pay me?

556
00:52:20,350 --> 00:52:21,950
[gentle scoff]

557
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:24,190
Let me tell you something, Agent Peña.

558
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:27,400
Maybe it'll make you feel better,
but maybe not.

559
00:52:28,530 --> 00:52:32,990
We're gonna get them someday.
But not your way.

560
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:38,200
For everything you know, you're, uh...
extremely naive.

561
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:40,950
Anyway, I've enjoyed this.

562
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:42,770
The laughs.

563
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:44,810
Um... Oh.

564
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:46,880
I think the ambassador wants to see you.

565
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:51,720
I guess word about this Miami Herald thing
is spreading like a prairie fire.

566
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,130
And bring your passport.

567
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:57,010
I think you're going home, but...

568
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,390
you didn't hear that from me.

569
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:46,970
Tata?

570
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,330
[static]

571
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,710
Tata, can you hear me?

572
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,840
[Tata] Pablo?

573
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:00,260
It's me, my love.

574
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:03,350
Finally, I can speak to you, my love.

575
00:55:03,970 --> 00:55:05,600
I've missed you so much.

576
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:08,310
Where have you been, Pablo?

577
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:14,400
I had to do something very important.

578
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,820
But I'm back home, my love.

579
00:55:23,950 --> 00:55:25,950
I'm home.
