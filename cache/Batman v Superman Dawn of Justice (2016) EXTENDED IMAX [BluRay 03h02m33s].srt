1
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:21,271
There was a time above.

2
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,982
A time before.

3
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:26,902
There were perfect things,

4
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,196
diamond absolutes.

5
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:32,533
How things fall.

6
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:35,035
Things on Earth.

7
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:36,954
And what falls...

8
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:38,539
Master Wayne!

9
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:40,207
- is fallen.
- Bruce!

10
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,544
Bruce, it's all right.

11
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,339
Bruce, please.

12
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:12,067
Martha.

13
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:48,663
In the dream,
they took me to the light.

14
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,665
A beautiful lie.

15
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:37,254
- Jack.
- Bruce.

16
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:38,547
Jack, listen to me.

17
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,799
I want you to get everyone
out of the building right now.

18
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:43,218
- You understand?
- My God.

19
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,427
Stay away from the windows!

20
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,596
Let's go. Come on.
Start moving now, people. Let's go.

21
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,474
The boss wants us out of the building,
so let's make it happen.

22
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:51,518
Jack. Jack!

23
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:33,954
We're sorry.

24
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:38,458
All circuits are busy now. Will you
please try your call again later?

25
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,002
Heavenly God,

26
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,297
creator of Heaven and Earth,

27
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,675
have mercy on my soul.

28
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,680
Jack!

29
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:33,013
Buddy hands! Everybody show me!
Good job!

30
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,348
Come on, guys.

31
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:38,518
Hold on tight.

32
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,021
Come on, guys.

33
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,732
Go.

34
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:44,941
Mr. Wayne!

35
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:48,069
Mr. Wayne! I can't feel my legs.

36
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:49,696
I can't feel my legs.

37
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,905
We need help over here!

38
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,533
Help me. I can't feel my legs.

39
00:08:53,616 --> 00:08:55,368
You're gonna be okay. You hear me?

40
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,413
Wallace? What do they call you,
Wally?

41
00:09:00,665 --> 00:09:01,666
You're the boss, boss.

42
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,503
All right. You're gonna be okay.

43
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,047
Easy, easy. Come on.

44
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:11,801
My God. I can't move my leg.

45
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:14,721
My God. I can't feel my legs.

46
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:25,023
It's okay.
You're gonna be okay.

47
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:28,401
You're okay. All right?

48
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,028
You know what?
We're gonna find your mom.

49
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,696
Where is she?

50
00:11:34,319 --> 00:11:37,864
All that wind is bad luck.
Blood in the sky.

51
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,699
There she is!

52
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,250
Miss Lane.

53
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,754
Miss Lane. Jimmy Olsen.

54
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,881
Photographer. Obviously.

55
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,507
Where's Heron?

56
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:57,967
Trouble at the border.

57
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:03,431
So, how'd you land it?
This is, like, pioneer stuff.

58
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,725
Amajagh's never given an interview.

59
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:08,895
You know what Heron always says
when we're on assignment together?

60
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:11,898
Not a goddamn thing.

61
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:13,733
I like Heron.

62
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,748
Let's go.

63
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,548
Passports. Electronics.
Phones. Camera.

64
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:39,926
Your fixer said that
the general approved photos.

65
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,999
Are you a terrorist, General?

66
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,877
They did not tell me the interview
was with a lady.

67
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,796
I'm not a lady. I'm a journalist.

68
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:22,427
What I am
is a man with nothing

69
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,179
except a love of my people.

70
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:28,808
Who's paying for these
security contractors, General?

71
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:31,728
Who pays for the drones
that pass over our heads at night?

72
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:35,106
One question begs another.

73
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,566
Yes?

74
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,818
Say what you're saying, General.

75
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,236
It's just a camera.

76
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,739
The United States
has declared its neutrality

77
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:46,242
in your country's civil war
both in policy and in principle.

78
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:49,579
Don't open... You just exposed...

79
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:54,167
These pious American fictions...

80
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,835
spoken like truth.

81
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,045
Okay. That's my film.

82
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:07,055
Men with power obey
neither policy nor principle, Miss Lane.

83
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:11,517
No one is different.

84
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:14,645
No one is neutral.

85
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:25,490
CIA.

86
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:27,950
They're tracking us!

87
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,453
You!

88
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:35,917
You're CIA?

89
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,251
What? No. No!

90
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:40,171
- You brought him here!
- No, he's a photographer.

91
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:43,049
No!

92
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,098
It's okay, Lois.

93
00:15:07,115 --> 00:15:08,116
Talon's down, sir.

94
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:10,701
Python, we have lost our asset
on the ground.

95
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:12,954
Repeat, we have lost our asset
on the ground.

96
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:15,915
There's still a civilian
in the compound. We'll extract her.

97
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:19,293
Negative. RPA to engage.
Stand down and get black.

98
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:21,921
There'll be friendlies
in the blast zone, so...

99
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,798
Call off the goddamn drone.

100
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:27,093
Stand down is an order. Python?

101
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,678
Let's move!

102
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:37,937
I...

103
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,605
I didn't know.

104
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:44,986
Ignorance is not the same as innocence,

105
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:46,946
Miss Lane.

106
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,601
Get up! Stand up!

107
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,781
Quickly. He's coming.

108
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,087
Inbound 2 mikes.

109
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,007
Passing Python now.

110
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:57,558
Move out!

111
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:07,318
- Target locked.
- You are clear to engage.

112
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,070
Armed hot and in range.

113
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:15,952
Three.

114
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,081
Two. One.

115
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,051
Link's been hit.

116
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,219
By what?

117
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:41,227
Take one step,
you will see the inside of her head.

118
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:08,022
The women in the village
heard a noise.

119
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,818
Like the sky cracked open.

120
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:17,948
He came down. Then came fire.

121
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,786
Even worse came after.

122
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,330
The government attacked.

123
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,083
No mercy in the villages.

124
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,252
My parents tried to run.

125
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:38,177
The world has been so caught up
with what Superman can do

126
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,263
that no one has asked what he should do.

127
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:47,019
Let the record show that this
committee holds him responsible.

128
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:49,105
He'll never answer to you.

129
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:53,818
He answers to no one.
Not even, I think, to God.

130
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,197
58 to nothing.

131
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,533
Metropolis, again,
blowing out Gotham City.

132
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:02,493
Really, only the diehards
are left in the stands.

133
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:05,371
Delta Charlie 27-Reports
of screams coming from vacant home

134
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,248
at 1939 Harborway.

135
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,749
Tom, it's been great
working with you.

136
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,418
I want to thank
our producer and director.

137
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,211
- Now wait a second.
- I don't even want to suggest...

138
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,462
Delta Charlie 27, respond-

139
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:14,630
Just take a knee.

140
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,466
They're lining up as if
Clarkson is gonna throw it deep here.

141
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,009
- Don't tell me, Dave.
- Going to the end zone!

142
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,636
- This is unnecessary.
- Delta Charlie 27.

143
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,723
Zeke Baker is open.
Baker with a touchdown catch!

144
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,099
I can't believe I just watched that.

145
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:27,351
Delta Charlie 27-
Do you copy?

146
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,687
10-4. We're on it.

147
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:31,856
And now
a fight breaks out.

148
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:35,276
Gotham City, you know
how they are about their football team.

149
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,237
Things could get ugly
in the city tonight.

150
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,237
Go.

151
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,293
It's okay.

152
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:35,961
It's okay.

153
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,880
We're gonna help.
We're here to help.

154
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:41,425
We're gonna get you out of here. Okay?

155
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,229
I don't understand.

156
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,527
Please don't. Please don't.

157
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:12,122
Please. I don't know who he is.

158
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,085
I don't know who he is!

159
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,090
No!

160
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:42,945
Fuck.

161
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:23,027
Christ!

162
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:24,612
I saw him.

163
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:26,655
I never saw him before.
I... I didn't know.

164
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,240
You almost took my face off.

165
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,534
How about you don't shoot
the good guys?

166
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:35,956
Jesus Christ.

167
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:37,958
He branded him.

168
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:09,883
- Hey.
- Hey.

169
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,468
I was gonna cook.

170
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:13,262
Surprise you.

171
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,768
They held hearings about what happened.

172
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:23,439
- They're saying that--
- I don't care.

173
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,649
I don't care what they're saying.

174
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:29,319
The woman I love could have
been blown up or shot.

175
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,113
Think of what could have happened.

176
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,740
Well, think about what did happen.

177
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,868
I didn't kill those men,
if that's what they think.

178
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,202
If that's what you're saying.

179
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,872
No, I'm saying
I want to understand what happened.

180
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,751
I'm saying thank you for saving my life.

181
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:45,502
I'm saying there's a cost.

182
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,555
I just don't know if it's possible.

183
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,224
Don't know if what's possible?

184
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,480
For you to love me and be you.

185
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,093
Clark!

186
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:37,346
Clark, you're going
to flood the apartment.

187
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:13,465
You still working?

188
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,927
You're getting slow
in your old age, Alfred.

189
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:19,096
Comes to us all, Master Wayne.

190
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,850
Even you got too old to die young.

191
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,895
And not for lack of trying.

192
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:32,651
Funnel-ferry butterbar.
Funnel-ferry butterbar. Funnel-ferry...

193
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,361
There's nothing wrong
with the microphone.

194
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,781
It's this new layer of armor.

195
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:40,242
I'll just have to rewire.

196
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:45,706
So, last night was productive?

197
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:50,043
No. He's too low-level. He knew nothing.

198
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,421
This is the man who knows things.

199
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,550
Anatoli Knyazev. He's Russian.

200
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,468
Contracts all over the globe,

201
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:00,012
but he's based out of
the port of Gotham.

202
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,722
Weapons and human trafficking.

203
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:05,017
So the White Portuguese
is a Russian. That's the theory.

204
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:10,147
No. The theory is that the Russian
will lead me to the man himself.

205
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:13,358
If he is, indeed, a "him."

206
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,529
You don't even know if he exists.
Could be a phantasm.

207
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:19,865
One that wants to bring
a dirty bomb into Gotham?

208
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:22,659
High-stakes round.

209
00:28:25,746 --> 00:28:26,663
New rules.

210
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:32,169
We're criminals, Alfred.

211
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,504
We've always been criminals.
Nothing's changed.

212
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:36,924
Yes, it has, sir.

213
00:28:39,593 --> 00:28:41,178
Everything's changed.

214
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:48,018
Men fall from the sky.

215
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,355
The gods hurl thunderbolts.

216
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:54,066
Innocents die.

217
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:57,402
That's how it starts, sir.

218
00:28:58,195 --> 00:29:00,239
The fever. The rage.

219
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:03,283
The feeling of powerlessness.

220
00:29:04,952 --> 00:29:09,206
It turns good men cruel.

221
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,969
John, get D.

222
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,889
Ooh. Ahoy, ahoy!
I did not know you were here.

223
00:29:26,098 --> 00:29:27,933
- Man on the marquee.
- Yeah, don't believe it.

224
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,518
My father named the company
after himself.

225
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,353
He was the Lex in front of the Corp.
How you doin'?

226
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:32,813
Really great.

227
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,607
Really great? Good. Good. Follow me.

228
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,819
No, Dad started saying
that he named the company

229
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,445
after his kid at investor pitches.

230
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:42,781
Rich old ladies.
They thought it was very cute, you know?

231
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,408
"Write checks for Lex."

232
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:47,619
You know, Dad was born in East Germany.

233
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:50,038
He grew up eating stale crackers.

234
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:52,457
And every other Saturday,
he had to march in a parade

235
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:54,376
and wave flowers at tyrants.

236
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:58,547
So, I think it was providence
that his son, me,

237
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,840
would end up with this.

238
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,259
One of my Rebuild Metropolis
crews found it.

239
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,845
Little souvenir from
the Kryptonian World Engine.

240
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:07,222
What does a rock have to do
with homeland security?

241
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:08,807
Homeland security?

242
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,643
No, no, no, ma'am, planetary security.

243
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:14,479
The fragment
is of a radioactive xenomineral.

244
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:16,857
We suspected it might
have bio-interactions,

245
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,109
so we took the sample to AMRIID,

246
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:23,447
where they keep the remains
of the Kryptonian decedent.

247
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,992
And, when we exposed
General Zod to the mineral,

248
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,535
this happened.

249
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:33,498
Profound biodegradation.
Decaying Kryptonian cells.

250
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:35,208
We concluded the mineral
could be weaponized

251
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:36,668
if a large enough sample was found.

252
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:39,921
And then, among the fishes, a whale.

253
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,592
Lying at the bottom of the Indian Ocean.

254
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:46,386
Emerald City.

255
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:47,929
Beautiful.

256
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:49,848
Now, Rocky is radioactive,

257
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:53,143
but what he needs from you
is an import license.

258
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:55,854
And why would we want to
weaponize this material?

259
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:56,938
As a deterrent.

260
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:59,608
A silver bullet to keep in reserve,
to use against the Kryptonians,

261
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,109
so the day does not come, madam,

262
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,528
when your children are waving
daisies at a reviewing stand.

263
00:31:03,612 --> 00:31:06,823
Last I looked, the only one of those
flying around up here was Superman.

264
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:10,035
Ha-ha, yes. Superman.
Yeah, but there are...

265
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:11,286
There are more of them.

266
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:12,579
The metahuman thesis.

267
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:14,039
Yes, the metahuman thesis.

268
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:17,667
More likely than not
these exceptional beings live among us.

269
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:20,003
The basis of our myths.
Gods among men upon

270
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:21,755
our little blue planet here.

271
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,176
Now, you don't have to use
a silver bullet.

272
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:28,595
But if you forge one...

273
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,180
Well, then

274
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:32,724
we don't have to depend
upon the kindness of monsters.

275
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,940
There are ways we can help each other.

276
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,735
Would you step into
my office here?

277
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:48,198
Yes.

278
00:31:48,824 --> 00:31:50,075
What's your wish list?

279
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:57,124
Access to the wreck of
the crashed Kryptonian ship?

280
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:00,377
Done.

281
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:52,304
The complete remains
of the dead alien for testing.

282
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:55,182
You want Zod's body?

283
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:57,476
Okay.

284
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:35,222
It's cherry.

285
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:42,979
Because the time has come

286
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:46,316
for the world to hear
the other side of the story.

287
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:49,694
They say that Superman is a hero-
Okay, but whose hero?

288
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:52,030
If Superman
were here right now,

289
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,573
what would you want to say to him?

290
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:56,201
That my family, too,
had dreams.

291
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:02,874
To look him in his eye
and ask him how he decides

292
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,834
which lives count.

293
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,337
And which ones do not.

294
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:18,992
Sir, get down.

295
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,288
Sir, I said get down!

296
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,372
Now!

297
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:27,751
Can we get some backup here?

298
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:31,212
Hey! Hey! Don't do it!

299
00:35:31,296 --> 00:35:32,213
Hey!

300
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:37,010
Lois! Crime lab, on three.

301
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,263
- This is Lane.
- Kent.

302
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:41,681
You're Sports today.

303
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:44,100
I want you to go to Gotham,
follow up on football.

304
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:48,271
"Underdog Dreams Dashed:
Ten Yards Between Gotham and Glory."

305
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,609
Watch yourself over there in Gotham.
Don't let them take your lunch money.

306
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,779
Hey. Are you guys watching this?

307
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,530
Emergency responders quickly created

308
00:35:57,614 --> 00:36:00,283
a precautionary perimeter
around Heroes Park...

309
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:02,702
while they brought the man down
from this beloved monument.

310
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:06,081
The suspect has been identified
as Wallace Vernon Keefe.

311
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,415
I work for Bruce Wayne!

312
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:08,917
I work for Bruce Wayne!

313
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:12,545
He'll be arraigned on charges
of vandalism, resisting arrest,

314
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:14,756
and the felony charge of
making terrorist threats.

315
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:17,384
That carries up to 40 years in prison.

316
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:18,426
Poor son of a bitch.

317
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,303
Metropolis News 8.

318
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:21,346
Jenny.

319
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:26,309
Headline, "End of Love Affair
with Man in the Sky, question mark."

320
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:29,437
Okay.

321
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:11,896
Is she in?

322
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:14,190
No, she's been gone.

323
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:15,817
What'd she do, officer?

324
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:20,447
I'm not a cop. I'm a reporter.

325
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:23,825
The young lady living here...

326
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:25,618
She hasn't been back.

327
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:27,912
In fact, if she's smart,
then she's got out of this city.

328
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:31,082
And you need to
get out of here before dark.

329
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:32,292
Unless you want to run into him.

330
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,252
Don't listen to that nonsense.

331
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:37,922
Only people scared of him,
people who got reason to be.

332
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:39,340
Scared of who?

333
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:42,135
There's a new kind of mean in him.

334
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,512
He is angry.

335
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:47,766
And he's hunting.

336
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,353
Show 'em what you got!

337
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:54,731
Let's go. Come on!

338
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,319
Throw a punch, will ya?

339
00:38:01,154 --> 00:38:03,239
Let's go! Come on!

340
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,555
Thank you.

341
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:38,566
The house treats luck like an insult.

342
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,694
Good luck for one is always
his brother's misfortune.

343
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:47,867
Three nights with
a Bolshoi ballerina,

344
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:49,035
that line was all she taught me.

345
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:52,580
Not all, I'm sure. Good evening.

346
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:00,004
It's like a one-man
reign of terror.

347
00:39:00,088 --> 00:39:03,925
This Bat vigilante has been
consistently targeting the port

348
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,677
and the adjacent projects and tenements.

349
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,846
And, as far as I can tell,
the cops are actually helping him.

350
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,765
"Crime Wave in Gotham."

351
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:14,060
Other breaking news, "Water, Wet."

352
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:15,520
Did you file the football yet?

353
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,564
Why aren't we covering this?

354
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:19,148
Poor people don't buy papers?

355
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:21,359
People don't buy papers, period, Kent.

356
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,861
Perry, when you assign a story,

357
00:39:22,944 --> 00:39:24,696
you're making a choice
about who matters.

358
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:25,780
And who's worth it.

359
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,866
Good morning, Smallville.

360
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:31,703
The American conscience died
with Robert, Martin, and John.

361
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:33,288
Sorry. I'm sorry.

362
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:37,917
No match. My guys in the crime lab
never seen one before.

363
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:41,880
It's called a bullet.
You shoot people with them.

364
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:44,507
Recovered from the scene
of the firefight in the desert.

365
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:48,136
Not sold anywhere commercially
in the world, even black market.

366
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,220
So?

367
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:52,849
So who gave prototype military rounds
to Tuareg fighters in the Sahara?

368
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,058
You're the reporter. Tell me.

369
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:56,102
I think that the US government
is arming the rebels

370
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:58,187
while claiming to support
the elected government.

371
00:39:58,271 --> 00:39:59,606
The ask, Lois.

372
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:06,654
Flight to D.C. tonight.
Couple of days there.

373
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:07,864
Go.

374
00:40:08,489 --> 00:40:10,450
Coach. No extra legroom.

375
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:14,037
Economy plus.

376
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,246
Coach!

377
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:18,833
So, why didn't you tell me?

378
00:40:22,003 --> 00:40:23,212
You're digging up snakes, Lo.

379
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:28,134
- It's kind of dangerous.
- That is why I didn't tell you.

380
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:30,094
Lane, don't you have
a plane to catch?

381
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,096
Yes, sir.

382
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,725
Benefit for the Library of Metropolis.

383
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:38,811
Someone on the committee
requested that Clark Kent cover it.

384
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,981
Probably some old charity crone
who's got a thing for nerds.

385
00:40:52,659 --> 00:40:53,785
Senator.

386
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,454
Little bourbon before lunch?

387
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:58,498
My driver's outside. I can't stay.

388
00:40:58,581 --> 00:40:59,832
No bourbon?

389
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:01,918
Kentucky girl like yourself?

390
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:09,050
My dad always said that Kentucky mash
was the secret to health.

391
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,638
This was his room.

392
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,183
I kept it just the same.

393
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:26,776
"Maybe one day Dad'll come back
if I just keep everything the same."

394
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:28,736
That is silly.

395
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:32,281
The magical thinking of orphan boys.

396
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,243
I'm blocking the import license
for your mineral.

397
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:45,211
The redcapes are coming.

398
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:48,423
The redcapes are coming.

399
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:54,637
You and your hearings.

400
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,227
Galloping through the streets
to warn us.

401
00:42:02,562 --> 00:42:05,898
One if by land, two if by air.

402
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:15,116
Do you know the oldest lie
in America, Senator?

403
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:17,952
- Can I call you June?
- You can call me whatever you like.

404
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:21,748
Take a bucket of piss
and call it Granny's Peach Tea.

405
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:26,127
Take a weapon of assassination
and call it deterrence.

406
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:29,881
You won't fool a fly or me.

407
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:33,634
I'm not gonna drink it.

408
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:40,892
You don't think Dad would mind, do you?

409
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:45,772
If I changed just...
Just one thing in this room?

410
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,735
Because that should be upside-down.

411
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:54,739
We know better now, don't we?

412
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:58,034
The devils don't come
from Hell beneath us. No.

413
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:00,578
No, they come from the sky.

414
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:02,825
I hope the next generation of Waynes
won't inherit an empty wine cellar.

415
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:07,580
Not that there's likely
to be a next generation.

416
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:10,082
Thank you, sir.

417
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:16,547
This is every call made
from the Russian's phone.

418
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:19,217
Two mentions of business
with the White Portuguese.

419
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:22,178
And it's continually
transmitting blacked-out data

420
00:45:22,261 --> 00:45:25,473
to the personal residence
of Alexander Luthor.

421
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:28,851
You think Lex Luthor
is the White Portuguese?

422
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:33,397
I can't see that he needs the income
from imported arms.

423
00:45:33,481 --> 00:45:35,566
Regardless, I'll need to put
a leech at his house,

424
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:36,734
and I'm gonna need the suit.

425
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:41,030
The Bat interrogated six people
and came away with nothing.

426
00:45:42,782 --> 00:45:44,867
It was Bruce Wayne
that got the information.

427
00:45:44,951 --> 00:45:47,995
Well, Bruce Wayne can't
break into Lex Luthor's house.

428
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,747
Bruce Wayne won't have to.

429
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,042
He's been invited.

430
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:07,700
Who's that?

431
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:10,911
You must be new to
the "let them eat cake" beat.

432
00:47:10,995 --> 00:47:12,788
That is Bruce Wayne.

433
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,916
Philanthropist, bibliophile...

434
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:19,170
True friend
of the Library of Metropolis.

435
00:47:19,462 --> 00:47:20,921
Mr. Lex Luthor.

436
00:47:21,172 --> 00:47:23,466
Me? Okay.

437
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:29,388
Nicky.

438
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:31,807
You're embarrassing me. Um...

439
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:33,726
Speech, speech.

440
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:35,686
Blah, blah, blah.

441
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:37,855
Open bar.

442
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:40,107
The end.

443
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:46,113
The word "philanthropist"
comes from the Greek.

444
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:48,115
Meaning a lover of humanity.

445
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,951
It was coined about 2,500 years ago.

446
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:52,661
All right. Where am I going, Alfred?

447
00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:54,830
Go past the elevator.

448
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,374
Do a left.

449
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,417
That's right, must be.

450
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:01,420
It's in the service corridor
in the basement.

451
00:48:01,504 --> 00:48:02,922
Go down the stairs-

452
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:05,591
Gods and men.
Prometheus went with us.

453
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,427
And he ruined Zeus' plan
to destroy mankind,

454
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:10,012
and for that he was given a thunderbolt.

455
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,265
That seems unfair.

456
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:16,268
On a serious note,
the Library of Metropolis...

457
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:18,562
Go to the stairs. You saw them
on your way in. Down the stairs.

458
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:21,899
But at one time,
Dad could not buy them. No.

459
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:23,359
My father could not afford
books growing up.

460
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:25,611
He had to root through the garbage
for yesterday's newspaper.

461
00:48:28,197 --> 00:48:30,116
All right.
You got the kitchens on your right.

462
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:32,451
Do a left.

463
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:34,537
Right in front of you.
That's where you want to be.

464
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:52,596
May I help you, Mr. Wayne?

465
00:48:53,389 --> 00:48:54,890
I just...

466
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:57,685
I thought the bathroom was down here.
I must have...

467
00:48:58,102 --> 00:49:01,730
That last martini was
two too many, I think.

468
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,232
Men's room is upstairs.

469
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:04,608
Great. I'm okay.

470
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:06,986
I like those shoes.

471
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:13,492
I can't stay down here, Alfred.

472
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,286
Go upstairs and socialize-

473
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:18,122
Some young lady from Metropolis
will make you honest.

474
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,917
In your dreams, Alfred.

475
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:23,794
Books are knowledge,

476
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:26,755
and knowledge is power,
and I am...

477
00:49:27,548 --> 00:49:29,008
No. Um...

478
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:31,969
No. What am I? I...
What was I saying? No.

479
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,723
The bittersweet pain among men

480
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:38,726
is having knowledge with
no power, because...

481
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,396
Because that is paradoxical!
And, um...

482
00:49:45,149 --> 00:49:46,942
Thank you for coming.

483
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,695
Please drink. Drink.

484
00:49:59,163 --> 00:50:03,000
Mr. Wayne? Mr. Wayne?
Clark Kent, Daily Planet.

485
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:05,169
My foundation has
already issued a statement

486
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:07,171
in support of books.

487
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:08,964
- Sir?
- Um...

488
00:50:09,632 --> 00:50:12,843
Wow. Pretty girl. Bad habit.
Don't quote me. All right?

489
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:15,346
What's your position on
the Bat vigilante in Gotham?

490
00:50:17,014 --> 00:50:20,184
Daily Planet. Do I own this one?
Or is that the other guy?

491
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:23,062
Civil liberties are being
trampled on in your city.

492
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:24,480
Good people are living in fear.

493
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:29,360
Don't believe everything you hear, son.

494
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:33,072
I've seen it, Mr. Wayne.
He thinks he's above the law.

495
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:39,328
The Daily Planet criticizing
those who think they're above the law

496
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:42,706
is a little hypocritical,
wouldn't you say?

497
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:46,168
Considering every time
your hero saves a cat out of a tree,

498
00:50:46,252 --> 00:50:51,215
you write a puff piece editorial
about an alien who, if he wanted to,

499
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:53,175
could burn the whole place down.

500
00:50:54,093 --> 00:50:56,595
There wouldn't be a damn thing
we could do to stop him.

501
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,600
Most of the world doesn't
share your opinion, Mr. Wayne.

502
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,687
Maybe it's the Gotham City in me.

503
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:08,399
We just have a bad history
with freaks dressed like clowns.

504
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:12,111
Boys! Um!

505
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:14,238
Bruce Wayne meets Clark Kent. Ha!

506
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,865
I love it.
I love bringing people together.

507
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:17,908
How are we?

508
00:51:17,992 --> 00:51:19,493
- Lex.
- Hello. Good.

509
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:23,205
Hi, hello, Lex, it is a pleasure.
Wow! That is a good grip!

510
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:25,457
You should not pick a fight
with this person.

511
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:29,003
So, after all these years,
we finally got you over to Metropolis.

512
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,588
Well, I thought I'd come drink you dry.

513
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:31,672
Well, you're welcome.

514
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,090
You should hop the harbor
more often, though.

515
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:36,343
I'd love to show you my labs.
Maybe we could partner on something.

516
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:39,263
My R and D
is up to all sorts of no good.

517
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:44,852
That's seven minutes.

518
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:47,104
Looks like the transfer's complete.

519
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:48,814
- Mr. Luthor.
- Yes?

520
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:50,524
- The governor.
- Governor.

521
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:52,109
- Excuse me.
- Next time.

522
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:53,235
Governor! Hi!

523
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:55,154
Lex, it's good to see you.

524
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:34,526
Excuse me.

525
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,095
We,
as a population on this planet,

526
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:44,722
have been looking for a savior.

527
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:47,224
90% of people believe in a higher power,

528
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:50,519
and every religion believes
in some sort of messianic figure.

529
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:53,731
And when this savior character
actually comes to Earth

530
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:56,191
we want to make him
abide by our rules?

531
00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:58,318
We have to understand that
this a paradigm shift.

532
00:53:58,402 --> 00:54:00,738
We have to start thinking
beyond politics.

533
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:03,449
Are there any
moral constraints on this person?

534
00:54:03,532 --> 00:54:05,325
We have international law.

535
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:08,203
On this Earth,
every act is a political act.

536
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:12,666
Is it really surprising
that the most powerful man in the world

537
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:15,544
should be a figure of controversy?

538
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:18,547
To have an individual engaging

539
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:22,342
in these state-level interventions
should give us all pause.

540
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:25,095
Human beings
have a horrible track record

541
00:54:25,179 --> 00:54:27,514
of following people with great power

542
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:31,101
down paths that led to
huge human atrocities.

543
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:33,896
We have always
created icons in our own image.

544
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:37,274
What we've done is
we project ourselves onto him.

545
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:41,111
The fact is, maybe he's not
some sort of devil or Jesus character.

546
00:54:41,195 --> 00:54:43,447
Maybe he's just a guy
trying to do the right thing.

547
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:46,450
We're talking
about a being whose very existence

548
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:50,370
challenges our own
sense of priority in the universe.

549
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:52,664
And you go back to Copernicus,

550
00:54:52,748 --> 00:54:55,584
where he restored the Sun
in the center of the known universe,

551
00:54:55,793 --> 00:54:57,169
displacing Earth.

552
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:59,129
And you get to Darwinian evolution,

553
00:54:59,213 --> 00:55:01,256
and you find out we're not
special on this Earth,

554
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,967
we're just one among other lifeforms.

555
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:05,636
And now we learn that we're not even

556
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:09,598
special in the entire universe
because there is Superman.

557
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:13,477
There he is. An alien among us.

558
00:55:14,061 --> 00:55:15,229
We're not alone.

559
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:18,232
Are you,
as a United States senator,

560
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:22,236
personally comfortable saying
to a grieving parent,

561
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:26,156
"Superman could have saved your child,

562
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:30,369
but on principle,
we did not want him to act"?

563
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:32,329
I'm not saying he shouldn't act.

564
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:34,373
I'm saying
he shouldn't act unilaterally.

565
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:36,500
What are we talking about here, then?

566
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:39,169
Must there be a Superman?

567
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:42,589
There is.

568
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:56,687
Hello?

569
00:55:56,979 --> 00:55:58,021
Mom?

570
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:59,481
Clark!

571
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,776
What is it? What's wrong?

572
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:04,945
No. Nothing. I just...

573
00:56:08,115 --> 00:56:09,116
Hi.

574
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:12,619
Hi.

575
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:16,999
How come Dad never left Kansas?

576
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:23,005
Well, he just...

577
00:56:23,130 --> 00:56:25,007
You know how he was.

578
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:27,426
"What do I need to travel for?

579
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:29,177
I'm already there."

580
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,098
Just wish it was more simple.

581
00:56:35,893 --> 00:56:37,311
My baby boy.

582
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:41,565
Nothing was ever simple.

583
00:56:48,739 --> 00:56:50,407
An odd little duck.

584
00:56:53,994 --> 00:56:55,495
I've never seen a metal like this.

585
00:56:57,456 --> 00:57:00,208
Could be DARPA black box.

586
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:01,877
Who could find out?

587
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,295
Nobody who'd want to.

588
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,715
Maybe they gave them
out to the rebels to test in theater.

589
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:09,009
Using live soldiers as guinea pigs?

590
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:12,346
This is what makes you
such a good reporter.

591
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,514
Stuff like this still shocks you.

592
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,581
It don't come off!
It don't come off!

593
00:57:40,332 --> 00:57:41,667
Prisoner transfer!

594
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:44,711
You can't put me in general, man.
They gonna kill me.

595
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:45,796
Hey, you can't bring me to general.

596
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:47,589
You should be thanking
the tax payers of Metropolis

597
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:49,257
for taking in your branded ass.

598
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:50,676
- Sign here, please.
- I'm marked, man.

599
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:52,094
You know what they do
to people with this on them?

600
00:57:52,177 --> 00:57:53,178
He's only a criminal.

601
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:55,097
- This way! Let's go!
- They're gonna kill me!

602
00:57:55,764 --> 00:57:57,432
- They're gonna kill me!
- Let's go!

603
00:57:57,516 --> 00:57:59,726
Keefe. You made bail.

604
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:00,978
Open two.

605
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:07,818
Who paid?

606
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:21,498
Who the hell are you?

607
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:27,921
Just a man.

608
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:30,382
Yeah? Well, what the fuck do you want?

609
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:37,180
To help you stand for something.

610
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:43,645
Your three o'clock's here.

611
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:56,116
He made me half a man.

612
00:58:58,076 --> 00:59:02,039
My wife walked out on me.

613
00:59:04,249 --> 00:59:07,377
I can't even piss standing up.

614
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:09,921
Let me face him.

615
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:13,425
You'll take care of it?

616
00:59:15,177 --> 00:59:16,344
Good.

617
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:42,996
What?

618
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:02,933
Wrong room, miss.

619
01:00:03,475 --> 01:00:04,518
Secretary Swanwick,

620
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,144
you haven't been
returning my phone calls.

621
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:13,026
Miss Lane, if you'd like an interview,
Major Farris is just outside that door.

622
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:15,028
You're treating me like a stranger?

623
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,198
I'm treating you like a reporter.

624
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:22,202
All right. Is the US providing
experimental military arms

625
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:23,662
to rebels in Africa?

626
01:00:24,204 --> 01:00:25,914
You know, with balls like yours,

627
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:27,958
you belong in here.

628
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:31,253
What's your source on this?
A tin foil hat?

629
01:00:31,837 --> 01:00:33,797
No, not tin. But it's metal.

630
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:35,632
Fired in the Superman incident.

631
01:00:35,841 --> 01:00:39,344
Experts at the Pentagon can't ID it.
We haven't been told the truth.

632
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:40,428
Here's the truth.

633
01:00:40,512 --> 01:00:43,265
A reporter got greedy for a scoop
and went where she shouldn't have.

634
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:47,394
Superman acted like some rogue combatant
to rescue her, and people died.

635
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:51,106
Don't invent a conspiracy theory
to put back his halo.

636
01:00:52,566 --> 01:00:53,650
Or yours.

637
01:00:54,943 --> 01:00:56,027
- Major.
- Sir.

638
01:00:57,279 --> 01:00:58,280
So-

639
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:00,448
I logged into your Dropbox to find copy.

640
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:02,617
There's copy all right.

641
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:06,496
But nothing about football.

642
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:09,833
Nothing about the friends
of the Metropolis Library,

643
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:15,547
just the goddamn Gotham Bat thing
I told you not to pursue.

644
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,757
If the police won't help,
the press has to do the right thing.

645
01:01:18,008 --> 01:01:19,509
You don't get to decide
what the right thing is.

646
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:22,012
When the Planet was founded,
it stood for something, Perry.

647
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:25,891
And so could you if it was 1938,
but it's not 1938.

648
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:29,102
WPA ain't hiring no more.
Apples don't cost a nickel.

649
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:32,230
Not in here, not out there.
You drop this thing!

650
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:37,611
Nobody cares about Clark Kent
taking on the Batman.

651
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:41,448
So apparently Superman

652
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,742
doesn't want us to think of him
as American anymore.

653
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:47,120
And really, why would we?
Aside from the red and blue costume.

654
01:01:47,204 --> 01:01:49,039
And, I don't know, the fact that he has

655
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:51,499
one-third of the USA's initials
on his chest.

656
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:53,210
I assume the only reason
he's not wearing

657
01:01:53,293 --> 01:01:55,462
the Declaration of Independence
as a cape is...

658
01:01:56,171 --> 01:01:57,464
He thinks it's too on-the-nose.

659
01:01:57,714 --> 01:01:59,299
- What is going on back here?
- No.

660
01:01:59,382 --> 01:02:00,800
Guys, come on. Let's go.

661
01:02:00,884 --> 01:02:02,260
Get yourselves together
and get out there.

662
01:02:02,344 --> 01:02:04,679
Get those glasses on those trays.
We got thirsty people out there.

663
01:02:14,189 --> 01:02:15,649
I wonder, would you excuse us?

664
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,609
- There's something I'd like to show you.
- I'm sorry.

665
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:21,905
Now some scholars insist
that it never happened...

666
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:23,949
But I believe it's the action

667
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:28,161
perfectly in keeping with a king
who was also a psychopathic killer.

668
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:32,707
For me, it's the culmination
of 40 years curating.

669
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:35,919
And I can't believe it,
but I've finally got it here.

670
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:39,089
It's the Sword of Alexander.

671
01:02:40,674 --> 01:02:43,468
It's the blade
that cut the Gordian knot.

672
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:47,138
It's a triumph.

673
01:02:47,389 --> 01:02:48,556
Yes.

674
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:50,350
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

675
01:02:57,941 --> 01:02:59,359
It's a fake.

676
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:02,112
The real one was sold
in '98 on the black market.

677
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:03,446
And now it hangs...

678
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:05,532
Over the bed of the Sultan of Hajar.

679
01:03:08,994 --> 01:03:10,495
Excuse me.

680
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,665
Excuse me, miss.

681
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:16,876
The other night, you took something
that doesn't belong to you.

682
01:03:17,085 --> 01:03:18,628
Stealing's not polite.

683
01:03:19,254 --> 01:03:22,007
Is it stealing if you steal
from another thief?

684
01:03:23,717 --> 01:03:25,176
Who are you?

685
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:28,054
Someone interested
in the same man you are.

686
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:30,432
Is that right?

687
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,852
I believe Mr. Luthor has a photograph
that belongs to me.

688
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:35,312
Did you get it?

689
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:37,147
As it happens, no, I didn't.

690
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:40,984
The data you copied
has military-grade encryption.

691
01:03:42,444 --> 01:03:44,487
You know, I bet with that dress,

692
01:03:44,571 --> 01:03:47,407
nine out of ten men will let you
get away with anything.

693
01:03:47,574 --> 01:03:48,950
But you're the tenth?

694
01:03:49,034 --> 01:03:50,660
I'm guessing I'm the first

695
01:03:51,578 --> 01:03:53,413
to see through that
babe-in-the-woods act.

696
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:58,084
You don't know me,
but I've known a few women like you.

697
01:04:01,755 --> 01:04:04,007
I don't think you've ever
known a woman like me.

698
01:04:06,259 --> 01:04:08,887
You know, it's true what
they say about little boys.

699
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:12,057
Born with no natural inclination
to share.

700
01:04:13,308 --> 01:04:16,436
I didn't steal your drive.
I borrowed it.

701
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:20,774
You'll find it in the glove compartment
of your car.

702
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:22,984
Mr. Wayne.

703
01:06:16,264 --> 01:06:17,432
Did you get it?

704
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:18,766
The rock?

705
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:20,101
Yeah, we got it.

706
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:47,086
I'm sorry.

707
01:06:48,963 --> 01:06:51,716
Get down! Get down now!

708
01:07:07,649 --> 01:07:08,650
No!

709
01:09:03,014 --> 01:09:04,265
She was my world.

710
01:09:06,392 --> 01:09:08,186
And you took her from me.

711
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:20,406
Bruce!

712
01:09:20,615 --> 01:09:23,451
Bruce! Listen to me now!

713
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:28,414
It's Lois!

714
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:30,333
It's Lois Lane!

715
01:09:31,709 --> 01:09:33,044
She's the key!

716
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:36,422
Am I too soon?

717
01:09:39,092 --> 01:09:40,385
I'm too soon!

718
01:09:41,678 --> 01:09:43,805
You're right about him!

719
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:46,641
You've always been right about him!

720
01:09:47,016 --> 01:09:49,394
Fear him! Fear him!

721
01:09:49,811 --> 01:09:51,354
Find us, Bruce!

722
01:09:52,271 --> 01:09:53,731
You have to find us!

723
01:10:58,045 --> 01:10:59,839
The White Portuguese
is not a man.

724
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:01,090
It's a ship.

725
01:11:03,968 --> 01:11:09,140
Master Wayne, since the age of seven
you have been to the art of deception

726
01:11:09,223 --> 01:11:11,642
as Mozart to the harpsichord.

727
01:11:11,851 --> 01:11:14,937
But you've never been
too hot at lying to me.

728
01:11:17,482 --> 01:11:20,401
The White Portuguese is not
carrying a dirty bomb.

729
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:22,153
What is it carrying?

730
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:24,614
It's a weapon.

731
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:26,532
It's a rock.

732
01:11:27,325 --> 01:11:30,369
A mineral capable of weakening
Kryptonian cells.

733
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:32,455
The first sample big enough
to mean something

734
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:34,540
turned up in the Indian Ocean
three months ago.

735
01:11:34,791 --> 01:11:38,878
It is now aboard the White Portuguese
being delivered to Lex Luthor.

736
01:11:39,212 --> 01:11:40,797
Who I am going to steal it from.

737
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,632
To keep it out of Luthor's hands.

738
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:44,175
To destroy it.

739
01:11:45,676 --> 01:11:46,886
No.

740
01:11:49,597 --> 01:11:51,224
You're gonna go to war?

741
01:11:52,099 --> 01:11:56,521
That son of a bitch brought
the war to us two years ago.

742
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:01,400
Jesus, Alfred. Count the dead.
Thousands of people.

743
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:04,862
What's next? Millions?

744
01:12:05,571 --> 01:12:08,366
He has the power to wipe out
the entire human race,

745
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:10,910
and if we believe there's even
a 1 % chance that he is our enemy,

746
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:13,287
we have to take it
as an absolute certainty.

747
01:12:14,205 --> 01:12:15,456
And we have to destroy him.

748
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:18,251
But he is not our enemy.

749
01:12:18,918 --> 01:12:20,294
Not today.

750
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:22,880
20 years in Gotham, Alfred.

751
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:25,466
We've seen what promises are worth.

752
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:28,511
How many good guys are left.

753
01:12:29,804 --> 01:12:31,556
How many stayed that way.

754
01:12:34,642 --> 01:12:35,977
14 hours.

755
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:41,190
My name is Clark Kent.
I'm from the Daily Planet.

756
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:47,530
I'm trying to find out
what happened to an inmate,

757
01:12:47,613 --> 01:12:48,698
a Santos.

758
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:50,658
I can't give out that information.

759
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:09,552
Mommy!

760
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:14,599
Mrs. Santos?

761
01:13:16,183 --> 01:13:17,852
May I ask you a few questions?

762
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:21,564
He wasn't my husband.
But I know what he did.

763
01:13:23,024 --> 01:13:26,068
But he was a father. He was that, too.

764
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:30,448
They took him out of Gotham Central.
They moved him to Metropolis.

765
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:32,575
But inside, they know.

766
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:35,077
They know the mark all over.
Guards don't care.

767
01:13:35,328 --> 01:13:36,495
Bat's the judge.

768
01:13:37,705 --> 01:13:39,290
One man decides who lives.

769
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:41,125
- How is that justice?
- Talk to me.

770
01:13:41,709 --> 01:13:44,086
- Help me change it.
- With what? Your pen?

771
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:47,214
A man like that, words don't stop him.

772
01:13:47,715 --> 01:13:50,509
You know stops him? A fist.

773
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:56,933
Kent, I want to talk to you.

774
01:13:58,893 --> 01:14:00,019
Kent!

775
01:14:00,603 --> 01:14:02,605
Where does he go?
Where does he go, Jenny?

776
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:04,273
I don't... I don't know.

777
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:07,526
Clicks his heels three times,
goes back to Kansas, I suppose.

778
01:14:09,362 --> 01:14:10,363
Son of a...

779
01:14:23,125 --> 01:14:25,336
Turn it! Turn it!

780
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:10,256
Move out!

781
01:15:46,208 --> 01:15:47,334
Go, go, go, go!

782
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:27,583
No!

783
01:17:52,877 --> 01:17:53,878
Where is he?

784
01:19:13,832 --> 01:19:16,502
Next time they shine
your light in the sky,

785
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:18,295
don't go to it.

786
01:19:18,504 --> 01:19:20,923
The Bat is dead. Bury it.

787
01:19:22,508 --> 01:19:23,592
Consider this mercy.

788
01:19:26,095 --> 01:19:27,304
Tell me.

789
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:33,185
Do you bleed?

790
01:19:42,069 --> 01:19:43,153
You will.

791
01:21:25,506 --> 01:21:28,258
I don't have a halo over me,
Mr. Secretary.

792
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:32,096
I went into the desert, people died.
It keeps me awake. It should.

793
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:39,937
If you think that
Superman is a murderer,

794
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:41,355
then throw it away.

795
01:21:42,189 --> 01:21:43,857
But I don't believe you think that.

796
01:21:46,985 --> 01:21:48,737
How do we determine
what's good?

797
01:21:50,197 --> 01:21:52,741
In a democracy, good is a conversation,

798
01:21:52,825 --> 01:21:55,285
not a unilateral decision.

799
01:21:55,369 --> 01:22:00,082
So I urge Superman to come
to this Hill of the People tomorrow

800
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:01,375
to see those who have suffered.

801
01:22:02,793 --> 01:22:05,379
The world needs to know
what happened in that desert.

802
01:22:06,130 --> 01:22:07,589
And to know what he stands for.

803
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:10,926
How far will he take his power?

804
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:16,181
Does he act by our will or by his own?

805
01:22:24,022 --> 01:22:27,067
People hate
what they don't understand.

806
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:32,114
But they see what you do,
and they know who you are.

807
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:36,910
You're not a killer, a threat.

808
01:22:38,537 --> 01:22:40,581
I never wanted this world to have you.

809
01:22:44,084 --> 01:22:47,546
Be their hero, Clark. Be their monument.

810
01:22:47,629 --> 01:22:51,467
Be their angel.
Be anything they need you to be.

811
01:22:52,676 --> 01:22:54,178
Or be none of it.

812
01:22:55,888 --> 01:22:57,848
You don't owe this world a thing.

813
01:22:59,141 --> 01:23:00,225
You never did.

814
01:23:03,604 --> 01:23:06,398
This is DeNiros.
Transfer available to Kane Avenue.

815
01:23:06,482 --> 01:23:07,983
Please, mind your step.

816
01:23:38,055 --> 01:23:40,098
I have to speak
to the senator today.

817
01:23:40,182 --> 01:23:41,433
You cannot see
the senator today.

818
01:23:41,517 --> 01:23:43,185
I need to speak to her
before the hearing.

819
01:23:43,268 --> 01:23:45,145
Do you understand how important this is?

820
01:23:45,229 --> 01:23:46,480
I cannot let you
see the senator.

821
01:23:46,563 --> 01:23:48,232
Please, I need to speak to her.

822
01:23:48,482 --> 01:23:51,193
Please, madam. I beg of you!
Please don't do this!

823
01:23:51,443 --> 01:23:52,778
This is so important!

824
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:54,530
- Come with me.
- Don't touch me!

825
01:23:55,489 --> 01:23:57,324
- Please!
- I'm sorry. She wouldn't leave.

826
01:23:59,368 --> 01:24:00,994
I didn't tell you the truth.

827
01:24:02,162 --> 01:24:04,164
C.I. thinks the desert was a setup.

828
01:24:05,165 --> 01:24:06,917
Somebody wanted Superman to look guilty.

829
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:10,337
The bullet?

830
01:24:18,136 --> 01:24:20,055
The metal was developed
by a private company.

831
01:24:20,138 --> 01:24:21,223
What company?

832
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:22,599
LexCorp.

833
01:24:24,184 --> 01:24:25,185
Lex Luthor?

834
01:24:25,269 --> 01:24:28,105
He also had private security contractors
at the desert compound.

835
01:24:32,568 --> 01:24:33,986
Go on record.

836
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:37,030
Not a chance. It's classified.

837
01:24:37,823 --> 01:24:38,949
I happen to like my job.

838
01:24:39,324 --> 01:24:40,200
It doesn't make sense.

839
01:24:40,284 --> 01:24:42,327
You said that the ambush was
arranged to frame Superman,

840
01:24:42,411 --> 01:24:45,080
but how could they know
that he'd show up in the...

841
01:24:51,837 --> 01:24:53,755
In the middle of the desert. Thank you.

842
01:24:57,384 --> 01:25:00,846
The Senate hearing is expected
to get underway any minute now.

843
01:25:00,929 --> 01:25:03,098
And of course
the big unknown in all of this is

844
01:25:03,181 --> 01:25:04,391
will Superman show up?

845
01:25:04,474 --> 01:25:05,601
That is what
they're really waiting to see.

846
01:25:05,684 --> 01:25:08,312
Mr. Keefe. Mr. Keefe.
Soledad O'Brien, In the Moment.

847
01:25:08,562 --> 01:25:09,730
Quick question for you.

848
01:25:09,813 --> 01:25:11,356
You're heading in
to meet with the senators.

849
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:12,608
What will you tell them?

850
01:25:13,358 --> 01:25:15,819
I've come here to tell them
to wake up.

851
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:19,698
This is flesh and blood.
He has delivered a war here.

852
01:25:19,990 --> 01:25:20,949
And this...

853
01:25:22,242 --> 01:25:24,786
This is what war looks like.
I have nothing.

854
01:25:24,870 --> 01:25:27,873
There are plenty of people,
sir, who would say he's their hero.

855
01:25:27,956 --> 01:25:29,499
He is not a hero.

856
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:32,294
Grace, can you get Greg up here, please?

857
01:25:32,628 --> 01:25:33,837
Right now.

858
01:25:34,796 --> 01:25:36,673
An anonymous source
can verify everything

859
01:25:36,757 --> 01:25:38,550
I told you about what
happened in Nairomi.

860
01:25:38,634 --> 01:25:41,094
- An anonymous source?
- Run it.

861
01:25:41,178 --> 01:25:45,015
Luthor engineered the desert.
It was an ambush for Superman.

862
01:25:45,474 --> 01:25:47,100
Trust your reporter. Think Watergate.

863
01:25:47,184 --> 01:25:48,769
Yeah, and you need to think litigate.

864
01:25:48,852 --> 01:25:51,271
If you're wrong, Luthor will
sue the paper out of existence.

865
01:25:51,855 --> 01:25:52,898
You need proof.

866
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:54,358
No. It needs to run now.

867
01:25:54,441 --> 01:25:55,651
Before the hearing.

868
01:25:55,734 --> 01:25:57,569
If Superman knows,
it might change what he says.

869
01:25:57,653 --> 01:25:59,780
I am not going to risk the paper

870
01:25:59,863 --> 01:26:02,866
so that you can pass notes in class
to the man that rescued you.

871
01:26:03,241 --> 01:26:04,242
He paid her?

872
01:26:04,326 --> 01:26:06,828
Not only paid her.
He threatened her.

873
01:26:07,371 --> 01:26:08,789
Gave her a script to learn.

874
01:26:09,539 --> 01:26:11,416
Her parents are alive back home.

875
01:26:12,292 --> 01:26:14,086
But the girl's got a conscience.

876
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:16,254
He's been using the committee
as his puppet theater.

877
01:26:16,338 --> 01:26:17,172
Senator!

878
01:26:18,006 --> 01:26:19,049
Hi, you.

879
01:26:19,466 --> 01:26:21,009
Don't go anywhere.
I want to talk to you.

880
01:26:21,093 --> 01:26:21,927
You know what?

881
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:24,429
Mercy, you go in and make sure
no one takes my seat.

882
01:26:24,721 --> 01:26:26,056
So what you been up to?

883
01:26:26,139 --> 01:26:27,224
I'm just here to tell my story.

884
01:26:27,307 --> 01:26:29,434
That I was willing to finance
a Kryptonian deterrent,

885
01:26:29,518 --> 01:26:32,813
but a certain junior senator
from Kentucky decided to block it.

886
01:26:32,896 --> 01:26:36,900
Yes, the chair of the committee
on Superman is soft on security.

887
01:26:36,983 --> 01:26:38,694
Greg, why hasn't he been
getting our checks?

888
01:26:38,777 --> 01:26:39,778
He is, Mr. Wayne.

889
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:41,571
He gets a check from
the Victims Fund every month.

890
01:26:42,364 --> 01:26:43,281
He returns them.

891
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:48,662
who lost both his legs
in those horrific events in Metropolis

892
01:26:48,745 --> 01:26:50,247
that happened two years ago.

893
01:26:50,539 --> 01:26:51,665
Jesus.

894
01:26:53,667 --> 01:26:54,918
Why haven't I seen this?

895
01:26:55,001 --> 01:26:57,003
I'm sorry.
I'll get to the bottom of it.

896
01:26:57,587 --> 01:27:00,173
And there he is.
Superman is here.

897
01:27:00,257 --> 01:27:02,342
He is actually
at the United States Capitol.

898
01:27:02,426 --> 01:27:04,511
This is really a historic moment.

899
01:27:04,803 --> 01:27:08,890
Now we expect that Superman will give
some kind of a statement to the Senate,

900
01:27:08,974 --> 01:27:11,601
to the American people,
and, of course, to the world.

901
01:27:12,436 --> 01:27:15,105
He's here. He came.
He's above the Capitol.

902
01:27:16,481 --> 01:27:19,109
You are gonna be on the hot seat
in there, Junebug.

903
01:27:19,192 --> 01:27:22,404
I grew up on a farm.
I know how to wrestle a pig.

904
01:27:22,738 --> 01:27:24,740
Do you know the oldest lie
in America, Senator?

905
01:27:26,575 --> 01:27:28,201
It's that power can be innocent.

906
01:27:30,537 --> 01:27:31,705
Good luck.

907
01:28:07,657 --> 01:28:09,659
Miss...

908
01:28:09,743 --> 01:28:11,495
Rudy, she's good to go.

909
01:28:20,045 --> 01:28:21,046
Get out!

910
01:28:24,633 --> 01:28:27,344
- Get out! Get out!
- Superman! Superman!

911
01:28:34,559 --> 01:28:36,144
Another one came
this morning, Mr. Wayne.

912
01:29:15,058 --> 01:29:18,103
Let me say at the outset
that I'm grateful to our witness

913
01:29:18,395 --> 01:29:19,563
for coming before us today.

914
01:29:21,481 --> 01:29:23,275
This is how a democracy works.

915
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:25,443
We talk to each other.

916
01:29:26,903 --> 01:29:30,490
We act by the consent
of the governed, sir.

917
01:29:32,617 --> 01:29:35,662
I have sat here before
to say that shadow interventions

918
01:29:35,745 --> 01:29:37,622
will not be tolerated by this committee.

919
01:29:38,665 --> 01:29:39,833
Neither will lies.

920
01:29:41,877 --> 01:29:45,380
Because today is a day for truth.

921
01:29:47,257 --> 01:29:48,758
Because only by speaking...

922
01:29:59,394 --> 01:30:03,607
Only by working together can we...

923
01:30:09,571 --> 01:30:10,822
Can we...

924
01:30:20,790 --> 01:30:24,544
Can we create a free, and a...

925
01:30:53,198 --> 01:30:54,199
My God!

926
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:21,017
We're back at
the nation's Capitol,

927
01:31:21,142 --> 01:31:22,727
where something is happening.

928
01:31:41,121 --> 01:31:42,247
Excuse me.

929
01:31:42,706 --> 01:31:44,374
Excuse me, officer.

930
01:31:45,417 --> 01:31:47,669
Member of the press.
Can you let me in, please?

931
01:31:55,677 --> 01:31:57,178
Breathe slowly and deeply.

932
01:31:57,804 --> 01:31:58,972
You're gonna be fine.

933
01:32:06,688 --> 01:32:10,066
Thank you.
I'm gonna need a little room to work.

934
01:32:11,609 --> 01:32:14,237
Ma'am, it appears
you've suffered a head injury.

935
01:32:15,155 --> 01:32:17,073
I'm gonna need you
to follow my light with your eyes.

936
01:33:07,832 --> 01:33:09,417
Master Wayne.

937
01:33:12,587 --> 01:33:14,297
Mr. Wayne!

938
01:33:15,465 --> 01:33:19,719
in the Senate hearing room
where Superman was testifying.

939
01:33:19,803 --> 01:33:22,514
This is a catastrophic
situation at our nation's Capitol.

940
01:33:22,597 --> 01:33:23,890
We don't have exact numbers yet,

941
01:33:23,973 --> 01:33:26,184
but I can tell you that
more than a dozen people

942
01:33:26,267 --> 01:33:29,062
have died in this explosion.
First responders are at the scene.

943
01:33:29,145 --> 01:33:30,647
They are still bringing victims out.

944
01:33:30,730 --> 01:33:34,484
Now initially, Superman was helping
bring victims out after the blast,

945
01:33:35,652 --> 01:33:37,821
but he seems to have disappeared...

946
01:33:37,904 --> 01:33:39,280
raising questions.

947
01:33:39,489 --> 01:33:42,283
Carrie Birmingham, reporting live
from the nation's capital.

948
01:33:42,367 --> 01:33:45,161
Capitol police are now
confirming that the blast was caused

949
01:33:45,245 --> 01:33:47,789
by an explosive device
inside the hearing room.

950
01:34:12,730 --> 01:34:14,983
Run that one more time for me.

951
01:34:15,275 --> 01:34:18,111
- Can you enhance that?
- There you go, sir.

952
01:34:56,858 --> 01:34:59,402
Capitol police
are confirming to CNN

953
01:34:59,485 --> 01:35:00,820
that the suspected bomber is

954
01:35:00,904 --> 01:35:03,198
Wallace Vernon Keefe.
Now these sources...

955
01:35:03,281 --> 01:35:04,908
Clark, it's me again. Can you...

956
01:35:04,991 --> 01:35:07,535
could have gotten
the explosive device into the hearing

957
01:35:07,619 --> 01:35:09,746
by concealing them
inside his wheelchair.

958
01:35:09,829 --> 01:35:13,249
As for Superman, he was in the room,
but obviously failed to stop him.

959
01:35:13,333 --> 01:35:14,667
I didn't see it, Lo.

960
01:35:15,919 --> 01:35:17,712
I was standing right there
and I didn't see it.

961
01:35:17,795 --> 01:35:19,589
Clark, there are people behind this.

962
01:35:19,672 --> 01:35:22,425
I'm afraid I didn't see it
because I wasn't looking.

963
01:35:25,136 --> 01:35:26,304
All this time,

964
01:35:27,347 --> 01:35:29,974
I've been living my life
the way my father saw it.

965
01:35:30,975 --> 01:35:33,144
Righting wrongs for a ghost.

966
01:35:35,563 --> 01:35:37,815
Thinking I'm here to do good.

967
01:35:41,653 --> 01:35:43,571
Superman was never real.

968
01:35:44,489 --> 01:35:46,950
Just the dream of a farmer from Kansas.

969
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:51,287
That farmer's dream
is all some people have.

970
01:35:52,038 --> 01:35:53,623
It's all that gives them hope.

971
01:36:04,968 --> 01:36:06,970
This means something.

972
01:36:08,429 --> 01:36:09,973
It did on my world.

973
01:36:11,140 --> 01:36:13,184
My world doesn't exist anymore.

974
01:37:32,221 --> 01:37:34,140
Welcome.

975
01:37:34,223 --> 01:37:38,978
Analysis reveals ship
operating at 37% efficiency.

976
01:37:39,771 --> 01:37:42,023
Would you like to assume command?

977
01:37:42,357 --> 01:37:43,775
Yes, I would.

978
01:37:44,359 --> 01:37:46,277
Yes, I would.

979
01:37:46,486 --> 01:37:49,072
Very well. Let's begin.

980
01:37:49,489 --> 01:37:54,243
The Kryptonian archive contains
knowledge from 100,000 different worlds.

981
01:37:54,744 --> 01:37:57,038
Good. Teach me.

982
01:40:28,314 --> 01:40:29,690
Alexander Luthor,

983
01:40:29,774 --> 01:40:32,151
your security override has been accepted

984
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:35,238
Genesis Chamber ready
to analyze genetic sample.

985
01:40:38,699 --> 01:40:41,619
Acknowledging presence
of genetic material.

986
01:40:41,827 --> 01:40:43,246
Analyzing.

987
01:40:45,957 --> 01:40:49,669
I've identified the host
as General Zod of Kandor.

988
01:41:05,226 --> 01:41:08,062
Acknowledging presence
of foreign genetic material.

989
01:41:08,145 --> 01:41:09,897
Analyzing.

990
01:41:10,398 --> 01:41:12,775
You flew too close to the sun.

991
01:41:15,194 --> 01:41:16,946
Now look at you.

992
01:41:18,364 --> 01:41:20,741
Advising. Action forbidden.

993
01:41:21,367 --> 01:41:23,786
It has been decreed
by the Council of Krypton

994
01:41:23,869 --> 01:41:27,290
that none will ever again
give life to a deformity

995
01:41:27,373 --> 01:41:29,333
so hateful to sight and memory.

996
01:41:29,625 --> 01:41:31,669
The desecration without name.

997
01:41:32,253 --> 01:41:34,672
And where is
the Council of Krypton?

998
01:41:35,381 --> 01:41:36,591
Destroyed, sir.

999
01:41:37,842 --> 01:41:39,343
Then proceed.

1000
01:41:39,635 --> 01:41:41,012
Very well.

1001
01:41:41,095 --> 01:41:44,390
Preparing chrysalis
and commencing metamorphosis.

1002
01:41:47,059 --> 01:41:48,644
"And so we are left to wonder

1003
01:41:48,728 --> 01:41:51,939
if Superman was aware of
the threat and did nothing,

1004
01:41:52,148 --> 01:41:55,026
was he then complicit
in the Capitol tragedy?"

1005
01:41:55,359 --> 01:41:56,235
Still no Kent?

1006
01:41:56,319 --> 01:41:58,154
"His disappearance
raises questions."

1007
01:41:58,237 --> 01:41:59,280
No.

1008
01:41:59,488 --> 01:42:01,824
There are still so many
unanswered questions.

1009
01:42:01,907 --> 01:42:02,825
Chief among them,

1010
01:42:02,908 --> 01:42:05,703
whether Superman was involved
in the planning of this attack.

1011
01:42:05,786 --> 01:42:08,331
I mean, here's an individual
who has unlimited power,

1012
01:42:08,414 --> 01:42:11,292
yet did nothing to stop the bomber
just a few feet away from him.

1013
01:42:11,375 --> 01:42:13,544
It just doesn't add up
for investigators.

1014
01:42:14,211 --> 01:42:15,713
Burn him, burn him, burn him,

1015
01:42:15,796 --> 01:42:18,341
burn him, burn him, burn him.

1016
01:42:40,488 --> 01:42:43,658
For 20 American, he didn't see you.

1017
01:42:44,742 --> 01:42:46,118
Same for me.

1018
01:42:57,004 --> 01:43:00,257
Now one FBI official
familiar with this case

1019
01:43:00,341 --> 01:43:01,592
told me they found, quote,

1020
01:43:01,676 --> 01:43:05,846
"A jackpot of bomb-making materials
inside Keefe's apartment."

1021
01:43:05,930 --> 01:43:07,264
What they need to determine now is

1022
01:43:07,348 --> 01:43:10,851
whether he had any help in the planning
and execution of the bombing.

1023
01:43:10,935 --> 01:43:15,648
And they haven't ruled out the idea
that Superman was a co-conspirator.

1024
01:43:16,232 --> 01:43:17,400
Now, my sources are telling me

1025
01:43:17,483 --> 01:43:20,778
they are getting a barrage of anonymous
and credible tips

1026
01:43:20,861 --> 01:43:25,700
with all roads in this investigation
leading to the Kryptonian visitor.

1027
01:44:02,778 --> 01:44:05,072
All right, Lois. You gotta go.

1028
01:44:21,922 --> 01:44:23,966
He didn't know he was gonna die.

1029
01:44:25,342 --> 01:44:26,761
He just bought groceries.

1030
01:44:26,844 --> 01:44:29,054
The wheelchair and
the bullet from the desert

1031
01:44:29,138 --> 01:44:30,765
were made from the same metal.

1032
01:44:30,848 --> 01:44:32,391
I know. The desert. The hearing.

1033
01:44:32,475 --> 01:44:35,060
Everywhere Superman goes,
Luthor wants death.

1034
01:44:35,269 --> 01:44:37,521
But, Luthor goes
through all of that trouble...

1035
01:44:37,605 --> 01:44:40,858
Creates a bomb out of a wheelchair,
and then alters it to reduce the blast?

1036
01:44:41,233 --> 01:44:42,693
What do you mean?

1037
01:44:43,027 --> 01:44:45,488
The inside of the chair
was lined with lead.

1038
01:44:47,740 --> 01:44:49,325
You couldn't stop it.

1039
01:44:49,825 --> 01:44:51,827
You couldn't see it.

1040
01:45:34,286 --> 01:45:35,454
Something, isn't it?

1041
01:45:37,581 --> 01:45:41,544
We men of Kansas live on a pancake,
so we come to the mountains.

1042
01:45:42,461 --> 01:45:46,257
All downhill from here,
down to the floodplain.

1043
01:45:46,465 --> 01:45:48,259
Farm at the bottom of the world.

1044
01:45:50,261 --> 01:45:53,097
I remember one season
the water came bad.

1045
01:45:53,305 --> 01:45:54,598
I couldn't have been 12.

1046
01:45:55,474 --> 01:45:58,143
Dad had out the shovels
and we went at it all night.

1047
01:45:58,477 --> 01:46:00,354
We worked till,
I think, I fainted.

1048
01:46:00,437 --> 01:46:02,106
But we managed to stop the water.

1049
01:46:03,482 --> 01:46:05,067
We saved the farm.

1050
01:46:06,527 --> 01:46:09,655
Your grandma baked me a cake.
Said I was a hero.

1051
01:46:12,032 --> 01:46:16,161
Later that day we found out
we blocked the water all right.

1052
01:46:16,245 --> 01:46:17,663
We sent it upstream.

1053
01:46:18,664 --> 01:46:20,749
The whole Lang farm washed away.

1054
01:46:22,334 --> 01:46:25,212
While I ate my hero cake,
their horses were drowning.

1055
01:46:28,132 --> 01:46:30,759
I used to hear them wailing in my sleep.

1056
01:46:34,346 --> 01:46:36,181
Did the nightmares ever stop?

1057
01:46:38,642 --> 01:46:39,768
Yeah.

1058
01:46:40,853 --> 01:46:42,730
When I met your mother.

1059
01:46:44,773 --> 01:46:47,526
She gave me faith that
there's good in this world.

1060
01:46:50,112 --> 01:46:51,655
She was my world.

1061
01:46:55,075 --> 01:46:56,577
I miss you, son.

1062
01:47:01,498 --> 01:47:03,500
I miss you too, Dad.

1063
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:24,897
You know you can't win this.

1064
01:47:26,690 --> 01:47:28,400
It's suicide.

1065
01:47:31,153 --> 01:47:34,615
I'm older now than my father ever was.

1066
01:47:36,617 --> 01:47:39,536
This may be the only thing
I do that matters.

1067
01:47:40,204 --> 01:47:44,041
20 years of fighting criminals
amounts to nothing?

1068
01:47:44,249 --> 01:47:46,710
Criminals are like weeds, Alfred.

1069
01:47:46,919 --> 01:47:49,588
Pull one up, another grows in its place.

1070
01:47:51,507 --> 01:47:54,051
This is about the future of the world.

1071
01:47:55,344 --> 01:47:56,804
This is my legacy.

1072
01:47:58,430 --> 01:48:00,557
My father sat me down right here.

1073
01:48:00,766 --> 01:48:02,559
Told me what Wayne Manor was built on.

1074
01:48:02,643 --> 01:48:06,313
Railroads, real estates, and oil.

1075
01:48:06,397 --> 01:48:09,775
The first generation made their fortune
trading with the French.

1076
01:48:09,984 --> 01:48:11,735
Pelts and skins.

1077
01:48:15,614 --> 01:48:17,199
They were hunters.

1078
01:48:33,716 --> 01:48:36,427
So falls the house of Wayne.

1079
01:48:37,469 --> 01:48:39,221
We gotta wait
for more evidence,

1080
01:48:39,304 --> 01:48:40,931
but the question still remains,

1081
01:48:41,140 --> 01:48:42,266
where is he?

1082
01:48:43,017 --> 01:48:46,729
If Superman was not involved,
if he's got nothing to hide,

1083
01:48:46,812 --> 01:48:50,607
then why hasn't he been seen
since the day of this tragedy?

1084
01:48:50,691 --> 01:48:52,026
You can't point
a finger and...

1085
01:48:52,109 --> 01:48:54,653
I'm not pointing anything, Warren.
Look. Ten fingers, see?

1086
01:48:54,737 --> 01:48:56,321
If there is going to be
a criminal...

1087
01:50:24,993 --> 01:50:26,912
The night is here.

1088
01:50:57,568 --> 01:50:58,569
Excuse me.

1089
01:51:00,863 --> 01:51:01,822
Don't I know...

1090
01:52:05,052 --> 01:52:09,014
Plain Lo in the morning. Lola in slacks.

1091
01:52:09,181 --> 01:52:11,266
Lois Lane.

1092
01:52:13,685 --> 01:52:15,354
Come see the view.

1093
01:52:15,646 --> 01:52:17,940
Um...

1094
01:52:18,023 --> 01:52:22,194
Now the secret to the height
is the building material.

1095
01:52:22,402 --> 01:52:26,114
It's light metals
which sway a bit in the wind.

1096
01:52:30,619 --> 01:52:32,120
And you know something
about LexCorp metals,

1097
01:52:32,204 --> 01:52:33,497
don't you, Miss Lane?

1098
01:52:33,914 --> 01:52:35,832
I've proven what you've done.

1099
01:52:35,916 --> 01:52:37,209
Wow, you're feisty.

1100
01:52:38,001 --> 01:52:41,755
Unfortunately, that will blow away.
Like sand in the desert.

1101
01:52:41,838 --> 01:52:43,590
You're psychotic.

1102
01:52:43,674 --> 01:52:47,386
That is a three-syllable word for
any thought too big for little minds.

1103
01:52:47,761 --> 01:52:49,930
Next category: circles.

1104
01:52:50,347 --> 01:52:55,018
Round and round
and round they go to find Superman.

1105
01:52:55,143 --> 01:52:57,229
Wrong category, boy.
No, no, triangles.

1106
01:52:57,312 --> 01:52:58,855
Yes, Euclid's triangle inequality.

1107
01:52:58,939 --> 01:53:02,776
The shortest distance between
any two points is a straight path.

1108
01:53:02,985 --> 01:53:05,737
And I believe
the straightest path to Superman

1109
01:53:05,946 --> 01:53:07,531
is a pretty little road...

1110
01:53:07,656 --> 01:53:09,741
Called Lois Lane.

1111
01:53:32,222 --> 01:53:33,849
You came back.

1112
01:53:34,599 --> 01:53:35,976
You came back.

1113
01:53:55,120 --> 01:53:57,456
Boy, do we have problems up here!

1114
01:54:01,626 --> 01:54:04,129
The problem of... Of evil in the world.

1115
01:54:04,338 --> 01:54:06,465
The problem of absolute virtue.

1116
01:54:06,548 --> 01:54:10,552
I'll take you in without breaking you.
Which is more than you deserve.

1117
01:54:10,635 --> 01:54:12,888
The problem of you
on top of everything else.

1118
01:54:13,096 --> 01:54:14,056
You above all.

1119
01:54:15,015 --> 01:54:16,308
Because that's what God is.

1120
01:54:17,142 --> 01:54:21,229
Horus. Apollo. Jehovah. Kal-El.

1121
01:54:22,522 --> 01:54:25,859
Clark Joseph Kent.

1122
01:54:27,277 --> 01:54:30,822
See, what we call God
depends upon our tribe, Clark-Joe.

1123
01:54:31,531 --> 01:54:34,493
Because God is tribal. God takes sides.

1124
01:54:34,701 --> 01:54:36,620
No man in the sky intervened
when I was a boy

1125
01:54:36,703 --> 01:54:38,955
To deliver me from
Daddy's fist and abominations.

1126
01:54:39,790 --> 01:54:41,583
I figured out way back,

1127
01:54:41,875 --> 01:54:45,170
if God is all-powerful,
he cannot be all-good.

1128
01:54:46,671 --> 01:54:49,841
And if he is all-good,
then he cannot be all-powerful.

1129
01:54:50,550 --> 01:54:52,427
And neither can you be.

1130
01:54:52,928 --> 01:54:55,305
They need to see the fraud you are.

1131
01:54:56,098 --> 01:54:57,599
With their eyes.

1132
01:54:58,558 --> 01:55:00,811
The blood on your hands.

1133
01:55:01,561 --> 01:55:02,562
What have you done?

1134
01:55:02,646 --> 01:55:04,523
And tonight, they will.

1135
01:55:04,898 --> 01:55:08,610
Yes. Because you, my friend,
have a date.

1136
01:55:08,693 --> 01:55:10,195
Across the bay.

1137
01:55:10,278 --> 01:55:12,781
Ripe fruit, his hate. Two years growing.

1138
01:55:12,864 --> 01:55:14,783
But it did not take much
to push him over, actually.

1139
01:55:14,866 --> 01:55:16,368
Little red notes, big bang.

1140
01:55:16,451 --> 01:55:17,911
"You let your family die!"

1141
01:55:19,204 --> 01:55:24,334
And now you will fly to him.
And you will battle him.

1142
01:55:24,876 --> 01:55:26,253
To the death.

1143
01:55:27,587 --> 01:55:30,465
Black and blue. Fight Night!

1144
01:55:31,425 --> 01:55:34,177
The greatest gladiator match
in the history of the world.

1145
01:55:34,469 --> 01:55:37,013
God versus man.

1146
01:55:37,097 --> 01:55:39,015
Day versus night.

1147
01:55:39,766 --> 01:55:42,978
Son of Krypton versus Bat of Gotham.

1148
01:55:43,061 --> 01:55:45,105
You think I'll fight him for you?

1149
01:55:45,230 --> 01:55:46,606
Yes, I do.

1150
01:55:46,815 --> 01:55:49,317
I think you will fight-fight-fight
for that special lady in your life.

1151
01:55:50,068 --> 01:55:52,279
She's safe on the ground. How about you?

1152
01:55:52,571 --> 01:55:54,948
Close, but I am not talking about Lois.

1153
01:55:55,907 --> 01:56:00,078
No. Every boy's special lady
is his mother.

1154
01:56:06,042 --> 01:56:08,378
Martha, Martha, Martha.

1155
01:56:10,213 --> 01:56:13,633
Why, the mother of a flying demon
must be a witch.

1156
01:56:14,342 --> 01:56:16,595
The punishment for witches,
what is that?

1157
01:56:17,179 --> 01:56:19,139
That's right. Death by fire.

1158
01:56:29,399 --> 01:56:31,067
Where is she?

1159
01:56:31,151 --> 01:56:32,861
I don't know!
I would not let them tell me!

1160
01:56:32,986 --> 01:56:35,363
If you kill me, Martha dies.

1161
01:56:35,447 --> 01:56:37,574
And if you fly away,
Martha also dies.

1162
01:56:37,657 --> 01:56:39,618
But if you kill the Bat...

1163
01:56:40,202 --> 01:56:42,078
Martha lives.

1164
01:56:46,875 --> 01:56:50,253
There we go. There we go.

1165
01:56:52,672 --> 01:56:56,218
And now God bends to my will.

1166
01:57:02,390 --> 01:57:05,227
Ooh, now the cameras are waiting
at your ship.

1167
01:57:05,310 --> 01:57:07,479
For the world to see
the holes in the holy.

1168
01:57:07,562 --> 01:57:10,148
Yes, the Almighty comes clean
about how dirty he is when it counts.

1169
01:57:10,232 --> 01:57:13,777
To save Martha,
bring me the head of the Bat.

1170
01:57:18,198 --> 01:57:21,201
Mother of God,
would you look at the time?

1171
01:57:21,284 --> 01:57:23,620
When you came here, you had an hour.

1172
01:57:25,038 --> 01:57:26,331
Now it's less.

1173
01:58:28,935 --> 01:58:30,228
Brooke Baldwin
is on the scene.

1174
01:58:30,312 --> 01:58:32,147
Brooke, you're live on the air.
What are you seeing?

1175
01:58:32,522 --> 01:58:34,190
There's something happening at the ship.

1176
01:58:35,525 --> 01:58:37,986
It's sending massive power surges.

1177
01:58:38,278 --> 01:58:39,779
Police helicopters
surrounding the area.

1178
01:58:39,863 --> 01:58:42,699
They've created a barricade
around this containment center.

1179
01:58:42,782 --> 01:58:44,242
And we're trying to get
a little bit closer here

1180
01:58:44,326 --> 01:58:47,162
to find out what's going on.
It is absolute chaos.

1181
01:58:47,245 --> 01:58:49,956
You can see that lightning,
those surges of electricity.

1182
01:58:50,040 --> 01:58:52,334
They seem to be getting
stronger by the minute.

1183
01:58:52,917 --> 01:58:54,294
Daily Planet.

1184
01:58:55,795 --> 01:58:57,088
Lois.

1185
01:58:58,423 --> 01:59:00,216
I have to go to Gotham
to convince him to help me.

1186
01:59:00,300 --> 01:59:01,259
Who?

1187
01:59:03,553 --> 01:59:04,971
Or he has to die.

1188
01:59:06,014 --> 01:59:07,015
Clark.

1189
01:59:10,226 --> 01:59:12,020
No one stays good in this world.

1190
01:59:21,279 --> 01:59:25,200
But as of right now, much
of the city remains in the dark tonight.

1191
01:59:25,283 --> 01:59:26,368
Much chaos.

1192
01:59:26,451 --> 01:59:29,579
Much confusion happening
on the streets of Metropolis tonight.

1193
01:59:29,663 --> 01:59:31,623
Those helicopters are still
surrounding the area.

1194
01:59:31,706 --> 01:59:34,584
I don't know if you can
still see those bolts of lightning...

1195
02:01:36,289 --> 02:01:41,294
2400 hours and 2 minutes.
Subject declining rapidly.

1196
02:01:41,377 --> 02:01:43,963
All procedural interventions
have failed.

1197
02:01:44,297 --> 02:01:45,548
Outcome---

1198
02:01:48,593 --> 02:01:50,178
will be death.

1199
02:01:58,478 --> 02:02:01,523
Dr-Silas Stone
suspending all clinical protocol.

1200
02:02:01,606 --> 02:02:07,946
US Gov, object 6-19-82
is successfully activated.

1201
02:02:29,467 --> 02:02:30,844
I need a chopper to Gotham-

1202
02:02:30,927 --> 02:02:32,095
Call the heliport.

1203
02:02:32,178 --> 02:02:36,224
Chopper? We can barely afford a bicycle.
You wanna chase a story? Go to the ship.

1204
02:02:36,307 --> 02:02:37,767
Superman's probably there already.

1205
02:02:37,851 --> 02:02:40,186
Perry, it's not for a story.

1206
02:02:45,567 --> 02:02:47,151
Jenny, get her a chopper to Gotham.

1207
02:02:47,235 --> 02:02:49,737
And forget the heliport.
Put it on the goddamn roof.

1208
02:02:49,821 --> 02:02:51,197
On the roof, Lois!

1209
02:02:53,658 --> 02:02:56,578
- Where are we headed?
- There!

1210
02:03:13,094 --> 02:03:15,763
Well, here I am.

1211
02:03:17,140 --> 02:03:19,058
Bruce. Please.

1212
02:03:20,310 --> 02:03:24,731
I was wrong. You have to listen to me.
Lex wants us to--

1213
02:03:39,662 --> 02:03:43,791
You don't understand.
There's no time!

1214
02:03:44,959 --> 02:03:46,252
I understand.

1215
02:05:02,662 --> 02:05:04,372
Stay down!

1216
02:05:04,622 --> 02:05:06,791
If I wanted it, you'd be dead already.

1217
02:05:44,996 --> 02:05:46,164
Breathe it in.

1218
02:05:49,250 --> 02:05:50,543
That's fear.

1219
02:05:53,838 --> 02:05:55,131
You're not brave.

1220
02:05:59,510 --> 02:06:00,845
Men are brave.

1221
02:09:50,783 --> 02:09:54,620
I bet your parents taught you
that you mean something.

1222
02:09:55,371 --> 02:09:57,081
That you're here for a reason.

1223
02:09:58,582 --> 02:10:01,085
My parents taught me
a different lesson...

1224
02:10:02,420 --> 02:10:04,588
dying in the gutter

1225
02:10:04,797 --> 02:10:06,382
for no reason at all.

1226
02:10:23,482 --> 02:10:25,985
They taught me
the world only makes sense

1227
02:10:26,068 --> 02:10:27,695
if you force it to.

1228
02:11:05,941 --> 02:11:07,943
You were never a God.

1229
02:11:11,405 --> 02:11:13,407
You were never even a man.

1230
02:11:20,289 --> 02:11:23,918
You're letting him kill Martha.

1231
02:11:29,548 --> 02:11:31,008
What does that mean?

1232
02:11:32,301 --> 02:11:33,928
Why did you say that name?

1233
02:11:35,096 --> 02:11:37,723
Find him.

1234
02:11:39,100 --> 02:11:40,309
Save

1235
02:11:40,726 --> 02:11:42,269
Martha.

1236
02:11:45,606 --> 02:11:46,690
Martha.

1237
02:12:17,513 --> 02:12:18,931
Martha.

1238
02:12:23,686 --> 02:12:25,604
Why did you say that name?

1239
02:12:25,729 --> 02:12:28,607
Martha! Why did you say that name?

1240
02:12:28,691 --> 02:12:31,235
Clark! Stop! Please! Stop!

1241
02:12:31,318 --> 02:12:32,945
Why did you say that name?

1242
02:12:33,028 --> 02:12:34,447
It's his mother's name!

1243
02:12:35,322 --> 02:12:38,284
It's his mother's name.

1244
02:13:08,147 --> 02:13:10,274
We're not getting
any answers.

1245
02:13:10,357 --> 02:13:12,401
We're still right outside
the containment center.

1246
02:13:12,485 --> 02:13:13,486
A dangerous situation.

1247
02:13:13,569 --> 02:13:16,864
Military and police personnel
surrounding the area.

1248
02:13:32,171 --> 02:13:33,297
Luthor.

1249
02:13:33,589 --> 02:13:35,758
He wanted your life for hers.

1250
02:13:37,051 --> 02:13:38,135
She's losing time.

1251
02:13:38,844 --> 02:13:41,138
The scout ship seems to be
drawing power from the city.

1252
02:13:41,805 --> 02:13:42,973
It's got to be Lex.

1253
02:13:43,182 --> 02:13:46,018
They need you at that ship.
I'll find her.

1254
02:13:46,227 --> 02:13:48,479
- My mother needs me.
- Wait.

1255
02:13:49,146 --> 02:13:50,898
I'll make you a promise.

1256
02:13:51,649 --> 02:13:53,567
Martha won't die tonight.

1257
02:14:20,636 --> 02:14:21,887
Master Wayne.

1258
02:14:22,096 --> 02:14:23,264
Alfred.

1259
02:14:23,347 --> 02:14:26,475
I'm sorry for listening in,
but I've tracked the Russian's phone

1260
02:14:26,559 --> 02:14:28,310
to a warehouse near the port.

1261
02:14:28,394 --> 02:14:29,728
You're locked onto it.

1262
02:14:29,812 --> 02:14:31,355
I don't deserve you, Alfred.

1263
02:14:31,647 --> 02:14:33,899
No, sir. You don't.

1264
02:14:54,003 --> 02:14:55,963
I'm afraid this is goodbye.

1265
02:14:58,299 --> 02:15:02,386
And every time we say goodbye,
you die a little.

1266
02:15:16,025 --> 02:15:17,568
- Take it down.
- Go! Go!

1267
02:15:41,258 --> 02:15:42,259
You have to take it, Alfred.

1268
02:15:42,968 --> 02:15:44,803
Right.

1269
02:15:44,887 --> 02:15:46,847
Commencing drone mode.

1270
02:15:50,142 --> 02:15:54,313
Thermal imaging is showing me
two dozen hostiles on the third floor.

1271
02:15:54,396 --> 02:15:56,565
Why don't I drop you off on the second?

1272
02:19:02,626 --> 02:19:04,127
Drop it.

1273
02:19:05,212 --> 02:19:07,005
I said drop it!

1274
02:19:08,090 --> 02:19:09,383
I'll kill her.

1275
02:19:11,343 --> 02:19:13,053
Believe me, I'll do it.

1276
02:19:16,557 --> 02:19:17,474
I believe you.

1277
02:19:29,903 --> 02:19:32,239
It's okay. I'm a friend of your son's.

1278
02:19:32,823 --> 02:19:33,991
I figured.

1279
02:19:34,867 --> 02:19:35,868
The cape.

1280
02:20:03,729 --> 02:20:05,480
"Late, late," says the White Rabbit.

1281
02:20:05,564 --> 02:20:07,149
Forty seconds to animation.

1282
02:20:07,232 --> 02:20:08,567
Right, wabbit?

1283
02:20:08,859 --> 02:20:12,613
Out of tricks, out of time.

1284
02:20:13,572 --> 02:20:16,199
And one Bat head short.

1285
02:20:16,283 --> 02:20:18,619
Thirty seconds to animation.

1286
02:20:18,702 --> 02:20:20,996
That'll be the cook. Excuse me.

1287
02:20:21,079 --> 02:20:23,332
Gotham Roast. Well done.

1288
02:20:23,832 --> 02:20:25,834
Hello. Break the bad news.

1289
02:20:26,043 --> 02:20:28,378
I'd rather do the breaking
in person.

1290
02:20:28,962 --> 02:20:30,505
Twenty seconds to animation.

1291
02:20:30,589 --> 02:20:31,840
You've lost.

1292
02:20:32,716 --> 02:20:34,009
I don't know how to lose.

1293
02:20:34,343 --> 02:20:35,594
You'll learn.

1294
02:20:35,677 --> 02:20:36,887
I'll learn.

1295
02:20:36,970 --> 02:20:38,263
I don't hate the sinner.

1296
02:20:39,348 --> 02:20:41,475
- I hate the sin.
- Ten seconds to animation.

1297
02:20:41,558 --> 02:20:43,977
And yours, my friend, is existing.

1298
02:20:44,728 --> 02:20:46,313
I cannot let you win.

1299
02:20:46,396 --> 02:20:47,773
I gave the Bat
a fighting chance to do it,

1300
02:20:47,856 --> 02:20:48,774
but he was not strong enough.

1301
02:20:49,066 --> 02:20:51,026
So, if man won't kill God...

1302
02:20:51,109 --> 02:20:52,778
two, one.

1303
02:20:54,571 --> 02:20:55,739
the devil will do it!

1304
02:21:13,173 --> 02:21:14,216
- Perry!
- All right.

1305
02:21:14,299 --> 02:21:16,093
Stay calm, everybody!

1306
02:21:16,176 --> 02:21:17,928
We're getting reports
there are total blackouts

1307
02:21:18,011 --> 02:21:20,514
in the north
and to the northwest of the city.

1308
02:21:20,597 --> 02:21:21,974
Federal authorities
are trying to determine

1309
02:21:22,057 --> 02:21:24,476
if this is part of
a larger terrorist attack.

1310
02:21:28,814 --> 02:21:31,692
Ancient Kryptonian deformity.

1311
02:21:32,025 --> 02:21:35,654
Blood of my blood.

1312
02:21:42,285 --> 02:21:43,954
Born to destroy you.

1313
02:21:47,416 --> 02:21:48,750
Your Doomsday.

1314
02:22:12,315 --> 02:22:17,029
Now God is good as dead.

1315
02:23:40,821 --> 02:23:41,905
POTUS joining.

1316
02:23:42,364 --> 02:23:43,448
Mr. President.

1317
02:23:43,532 --> 02:23:44,699
What the hell is it, Calvin?

1318
02:23:44,783 --> 02:23:46,201
These are live images
from the top

1319
02:23:46,284 --> 02:23:48,370
of the LexCorp tower
in downtown Metropolis.

1320
02:23:49,538 --> 02:23:50,872
Military aircraft are on the scene.

1321
02:24:02,717 --> 02:24:04,803
- Are you hurt, ma'am?
- I'm okay.

1322
02:24:04,886 --> 02:24:06,471
Good. You're gonna be all right, okay?

1323
02:24:16,314 --> 02:24:19,442
This thing emerged
from the Kryptonian crash site

1324
02:24:19,526 --> 02:24:20,819
just moments ago.

1325
02:24:20,902 --> 02:24:24,281
Thankfully though, the work day is over
in the downtown core.

1326
02:24:24,364 --> 02:24:25,365
It's nearly empty.

1327
02:24:25,490 --> 02:24:29,369
Now military aircraft.
Those are Apache helicopters.

1328
02:24:29,452 --> 02:24:31,830
They have now just arrived.
The images that...

1329
02:25:07,908 --> 02:25:11,286
We've, We just lost
connection with Metropolis 8 News.

1330
02:25:11,369 --> 02:25:13,538
Now, it's not clear what just happened.

1331
02:25:17,083 --> 02:25:18,752
What's happening there, Alfred?

1332
02:25:20,629 --> 02:25:22,547
How best to describe it?

1333
02:25:22,631 --> 02:25:24,132
Metropolis airspace
has been closed briefly.

1334
02:25:24,216 --> 02:25:25,175
Excuse me?

1335
02:25:25,258 --> 02:25:26,509
We kindly ask
that you stay in your seats.

1336
02:25:26,593 --> 02:25:29,429
Excuse me? Miss Prince?

1337
02:25:44,194 --> 02:25:45,570
Sir. Look,
they've cleared the city.

1338
02:25:45,654 --> 02:25:47,197
Looks like he's taking it into space.

1339
02:25:47,280 --> 02:25:48,949
We can go
straight to Key Red, Mr. President.

1340
02:25:49,032 --> 02:25:51,076
Not yet. Are you crazy?

1341
02:25:51,159 --> 02:25:53,870
They're high enough that we can nuke 'em
with no casualties, sir.

1342
02:25:53,954 --> 02:25:56,790
One casualty, Mr. President. Superman.

1343
02:25:58,833 --> 02:26:00,627
God have mercy on us all-

1344
02:26:07,008 --> 02:26:08,301
- Key is hot.
- Key is hot.

1345
02:26:08,385 --> 02:26:11,137
Red birds are armed to deploy, sir.

1346
02:26:12,222 --> 02:26:13,390
Fire at will.

1347
02:26:13,598 --> 02:26:16,226
Three, two, one...

1348
02:27:04,649 --> 02:27:05,984
God.

1349
02:27:27,922 --> 02:27:29,549
Projectile 1. Impact.

1350
02:27:29,632 --> 02:27:31,676
Stryker's Island, east of Metropolis.

1351
02:27:31,760 --> 02:27:34,554
- That's uninhabited.
- Projectile 2...

1352
02:27:40,143 --> 02:27:41,353
No apparent reentry.

1353
02:27:42,145 --> 02:27:43,646
Projectile 2?

1354
02:27:44,230 --> 02:27:49,361
Superman, Mr. President.
Projectile 2 was Superman.

1355
02:27:50,236 --> 02:27:51,237
Sir.

1356
02:27:52,322 --> 02:27:53,156
It's moving.

1357
02:28:34,614 --> 02:28:36,324
The shockwaves
are getting stronger.

1358
02:28:36,616 --> 02:28:38,952
Every time we hit it,
we make it more powerful.

1359
02:28:39,744 --> 02:28:40,829
We can't attack.

1360
02:28:41,996 --> 02:28:43,832
What are you saying, Calvin?

1361
02:28:44,290 --> 02:28:46,209
I'm saying it's unkillable.

1362
02:29:14,612 --> 02:29:16,781
Master Wayne, are you receiving me?

1363
02:29:16,990 --> 02:29:19,159
Alfred. It's Kryptonian.

1364
02:29:19,826 --> 02:29:21,828
Only Kryptonite weapons can kill it.

1365
02:29:22,412 --> 02:29:25,373
They might. If you had any left.

1366
02:29:25,832 --> 02:29:27,417
I got one round left.

1367
02:29:29,085 --> 02:29:33,047
The spear. Alfred, the spear.
It's pure Kryptonite.

1368
02:29:33,256 --> 02:29:34,466
It's back in Gotham.

1369
02:29:34,799 --> 02:29:37,969
If I can penetrate the skin,
the spear will kill it.

1370
02:29:38,052 --> 02:29:39,053
It would in theory.

1371
02:29:39,137 --> 02:29:42,056
I've gotta get it to chase me
back to the city.

1372
02:29:42,140 --> 02:29:43,600
Back to the Kryptonite.

1373
02:30:44,410 --> 02:30:45,620
Shit.

1374
02:31:35,420 --> 02:31:38,840
- Why did you bring him back to the city?
- The port is abandoned.

1375
02:31:38,923 --> 02:31:40,800
There's a weapon here that can kill it.

1376
02:31:53,605 --> 02:31:54,689
Did you find the spear?

1377
02:31:55,607 --> 02:31:57,108
I've been a little busy.

1378
02:31:57,191 --> 02:32:00,737
This thing, this creature,
seems to feed on energy.

1379
02:32:02,614 --> 02:32:04,824
This thing is from
another world.

1380
02:32:06,576 --> 02:32:07,577
My world.

1381
02:32:07,744 --> 02:32:10,246
I've killed things
from other worlds before.

1382
02:32:12,165 --> 02:32:13,166
Is she with you?

1383
02:32:14,250 --> 02:32:15,710
I thought she was with you.

1384
02:35:54,428 --> 02:35:55,638
Clark!

1385
02:35:56,472 --> 02:35:57,640
Clark!

1386
02:36:05,064 --> 02:36:06,482
Clark!

1387
02:36:16,492 --> 02:36:17,660
Clark!

1388
02:36:18,369 --> 02:36:19,996
Clark! Are you all right?

1389
02:36:57,783 --> 02:36:59,160
I love you.

1390
02:37:03,331 --> 02:37:06,834
No. No, Clark, you can't.

1391
02:37:08,544 --> 02:37:09,879
This is my world.

1392
02:37:10,338 --> 02:37:11,631
No, Clark, don't.

1393
02:37:15,635 --> 02:37:17,261
You are my world.

1394
02:37:17,720 --> 02:37:18,721
No.

1395
02:37:22,350 --> 02:37:23,726
Please. Clark!

1396
02:44:29,693 --> 02:44:30,694
Hi.

1397
02:44:37,910 --> 02:44:40,871
Clark had this sent here,
so he could surprise you.

1398
02:47:07,726 --> 02:47:09,853
"The dead shall live.

1399
02:47:10,771 --> 02:47:14,274
My slain shall rise again.

1400
02:47:16,818 --> 02:47:19,947
Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust.

1401
02:47:21,156 --> 02:47:24,535
For thy dew is like the dew of morning.

1402
02:47:26,328 --> 02:47:31,333
And the earth
shall give birth to her dead."

1403
02:47:38,632 --> 02:47:41,051
I need a ride
back to the house.

1404
02:47:41,134 --> 02:47:43,929
I forgot my checkbook
to pay the funeral director.

1405
02:47:44,012 --> 02:47:46,056
They said it's all taken care of.

1406
02:47:46,139 --> 02:47:47,140
By whom?

1407
02:47:48,141 --> 02:47:49,893
Anonymous donor.

1408
02:48:33,604 --> 02:48:37,190
All those circuses back east
burying an empty box.

1409
02:48:37,899 --> 02:48:39,818
They don't know how to honor him,

1410
02:48:40,902 --> 02:48:42,696
except as a soldier.

1411
02:48:44,406 --> 02:48:47,659
I've failed him in life.

1412
02:48:49,202 --> 02:48:51,038
I won't fail him in death.

1413
02:48:53,123 --> 02:48:55,000
Help me find the others like you.

1414
02:48:55,709 --> 02:48:57,669
Perhaps they don't want to be found.

1415
02:48:58,629 --> 02:49:01,506
They will. And they'll fight.

1416
02:49:02,507 --> 02:49:04,426
We have to stand together.

1417
02:49:12,225 --> 02:49:15,604
100 years ago,
I walked away from mankind.

1418
02:49:17,648 --> 02:49:19,524
From a century of horrors.

1419
02:49:23,236 --> 02:49:26,657
Man made a world where
standing together is impossible.

1420
02:49:30,285 --> 02:49:31,662
Men are still good.

1421
02:49:34,456 --> 02:49:37,250
We fight. We kill.

1422
02:49:38,335 --> 02:49:40,087
We betray one another.

1423
02:49:42,714 --> 02:49:44,549
But we can rebuild.

1424
02:49:46,093 --> 02:49:47,594
We can do better.

1425
02:49:49,221 --> 02:49:50,555
We will.

1426
02:49:51,306 --> 02:49:52,391
We have to.

1427
02:50:15,372 --> 02:50:17,165
The others like me.

1428
02:50:17,249 --> 02:50:19,334
Why did you say they'll have to fight?

1429
02:50:24,715 --> 02:50:26,133
Just a feeling.

1430
02:50:38,228 --> 02:50:40,856
Prisoner A-C-23-19-40.

1431
02:50:40,939 --> 02:50:43,734
The warden wants to speak to you,
so stand to your feet.

1432
02:50:45,193 --> 02:50:46,945
I'm gonna say this one more time.

1433
02:50:47,279 --> 02:50:50,198
The warden wants to speak to you,
so stand to your feet.

1434
02:50:57,748 --> 02:50:59,583
Turn around and face the wall.

1435
02:51:01,752 --> 02:51:03,962
Place your forehead against the wall.

1436
02:51:04,171 --> 02:51:07,799
Put your hands behind your back,
so that I can come in and restrain you.

1437
02:51:36,495 --> 02:51:39,289
Whatever you do, wherever you go,

1438
02:51:39,372 --> 02:51:41,374
I'll be watching you.

1439
02:51:44,795 --> 02:51:46,046
Look at us.

1440
02:51:47,589 --> 02:51:49,299
This is how it all caves in.

1441
02:51:49,758 --> 02:51:54,888
Civilization on the Wayne Manor's
out the window.

1442
02:51:59,309 --> 02:52:01,019
But who would believe me?

1443
02:52:01,144 --> 02:52:04,689
I... I'm insane.

1444
02:52:05,857 --> 02:52:07,734
I'm not even fit to stand trial.

1445
02:52:08,360 --> 02:52:09,820
That's right.

1446
02:52:10,028 --> 02:52:13,782
We have hospitals that treat
the mentally ill with compassion.

1447
02:52:13,990 --> 02:52:17,118
But that's not where you're going.

1448
02:52:17,327 --> 02:52:20,664
I arranged for you to get transferred
to Arkham Asylum in Gotham.

1449
02:52:21,998 --> 02:52:23,917
I still have some friends there.

1450
02:52:24,793 --> 02:52:26,211
They're expecting you.

1451
02:52:30,590 --> 02:52:34,845
But the bell's already been rung.

1452
02:52:37,514 --> 02:52:38,974
And they've heard it.

1453
02:52:40,642 --> 02:52:42,018
Out in the dark.

1454
02:52:42,561 --> 02:52:45,063
Among the stars.

1455
02:52:48,275 --> 02:52:51,653
Ding dong, the God is dead.

1456
02:53:01,371 --> 02:53:04,207
But a bell cannot be unrung!

1457
02:53:05,292 --> 02:53:09,004
He's hungry. He's found us.

1458
02:53:09,963 --> 02:53:11,631
And he's coming!

1459
02:53:14,843 --> 02:53:17,470
Ding, ding, ding.

1460
02:53:19,556 --> 02:53:22,350
Ding, ding, ding.

1461
02:53:24,603 --> 02:53:27,272
Ding, ding, ding.

1462
02:53:29,316 --> 02:53:31,026
Ding, ding, ding.

1463
02:53:34,195 --> 02:53:37,282
Ding, ding, ding.

1464
02:53:38,950 --> 02:53:42,412
Ding, ding, ding.
