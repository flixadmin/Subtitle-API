1
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,230
You guys didn't tell me

2
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,230
this stuff smells like cat piss.

3
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,270
Man, shit happens, huh?

4
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,820
I mean, I'm sorry, but I had to do it.

5
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,390
Obviously, I guess you see it different.

6
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,750
Some of you.

7
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,750
But I didn't see any other choice.

8
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,950
I've been thinking about this all day,

9
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,950
going over it in my head...

10
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,390
...and it was the only way.

11
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,750
Well, it's not like I wanted to.

12
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,110
The kid was on a dirt bike.

13
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,110
He could've just....

14
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,670
He could've gunned it and been gone

15
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,670
before we even had a chance to blink.

16
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,030
We never would've caught him.

17
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,030
I thought on my feet. I saw a threat...

18
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,630
- ...and I took care of it.

19
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,630
- A threat?

20
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,150
The kid was waving at us.

21
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,630
He wasn't going anywhere.

22
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,630
He was saying hi.

23
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,110
- Yeah, but you don't know that.

24
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,110
- Yeah, I do.

25
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,950
- He didn't know what he'd seen.

26
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,950
- I didn't want to take that chance.

27
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,550
The whole point of this was no one

28
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,550
was supposed to know we were there.

29
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,430
People weren't supposed to

30
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,430
know anything got robbed.

31
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,630
How could we let the kid go?

32
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,790
He made us. If I hadn't done what I did,

33
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,790
the mission would've failed.

34
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,830
I'm real sorry.

35
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,830
I really am, but I....

36
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,630
But did I make a mistake, Mr. White?

37
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,630
Because to me, you know, respectfully...

38
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,630
...I was looking out for the team.

39
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,630
I didn't want to kill him.

40
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,990
You gotta believe that.

41
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,120
At the end of the day, it was him or us,

42
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,120
and I chose us.

43
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,070
And I would do it again.

44
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,710
Okay, look.

45
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,590
Todd, why don't you step outside for a

46
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,590
few minutes so we can talk this through?

47
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,240
Of course. Yeah, you guys talk.

48
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,150
But I just want to make sure that you

49
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,150
know that my priority is this business.

50
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,350
Okay. That's fine, Todd. Thank you.

51
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,190
I want to be a real part of this.

52
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,950
All right? If you could just see that.

53
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,950
I'm motivated and I've got connections.

54
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,070
My uncle's got his hookups in prison...

55
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,150
...who I think could be a real help

56
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,150
to us if....

57
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,310
Okay. That dude? Wack job.

58
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,030
- Let's just stick to the facts here.

59
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,030
- Facts? Oh, okay.

60
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,510
How about the fact that he shot a kid?

61
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,470
A kid that he didn't need to shoot.

62
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,710
Well, the boy had seen us.

63
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,030
And, no, it didn't look like he knew

64
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,030
what he was seeing.

65
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,670
But what if he told somebody?

66
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,590
What if he just mentioned it

67
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,590
in passing?

68
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,430
We can't know what someone--

69
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,430
Exactly. We can't know,

70
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,430
because Ricky Hitler there shot him.

71
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,190
We, us three, should've had

72
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,190
a discussion about it.

73
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,630
We would've figured it out.

74
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,150
But that dickhead just went ahead

75
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,150
and made the choice for us.

76
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,110
- Is that how we do business now?

77
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,110
- I understand you're upset.

78
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,750
And what was that crap about his uncle

79
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,750
with the prison connections?

80
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,790
It's just some bullshit

81
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,790
intimidation move. Come on.

82
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,190
It's true, though.

83
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,190
He does have some connections.

84
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,110
- Is this a problem?

85
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,110
- No. It's nothing to be concerned about.

86
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,470
It came up in the background

87
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,470
I did on him.

88
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,280
Didn't worry me then. He's just flexing.

89
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,000
All right.

90
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,230
It seems to me that

91
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,230
we have three options here...

92
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,310
...and none of which are ideal.

93
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,350
One, we fire Todd.

94
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,390
- Yeah.

95
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,390
- I'm not a fan of this option...

96
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,910
...seeing that he knows way too much

97
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,910
about this business at this point.

98
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,470
And we'd most likely have to pay him

99
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,470
to keep quiet.

100
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,670
And God only knows

101
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,670
we've got enough of that going on.

102
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,750
We dispose of him.

103
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,670
Which leaves us option three.

104
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,830
We keep him on payroll.

105
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,590
Put him back on tenting houses,

106
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,590
setting up the lab and so forth.

107
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,030
We keep him close. Under our control.

108
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,950
Now, option three

109
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,950
would be my choice.

110
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,070
Shall we vote?

111
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,110
I vote three, kid.

112
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,830
You're still in.

113
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,390
Right on. Thank you so much.

114
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,390
You guys totally made the right--

115
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,470
The next time you bring a gun to a job

116
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:42,470
without telling me...

117
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,030
...I will stick it up your ass sideways.

118
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,830
- You understand?

119
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,830
- Yes, sir.

120
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,110
Hey, boss. What's up?

121
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,230
I was just in the neighbourhood.

122
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,230
Anything going on?

123
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,670
No. He's just hanging out

124
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,670
with his granddaughter.

125
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,710
Well, isn't that sweet?

126
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,830
Here, let me see.

127
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,710
It's a dead drop.

128
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,200
- What?

129
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,200
- A dead drop.

130
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,820
He just stashed something

131
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,820
underneath that trash can.

132
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,910
Write the time down. Roll on it.

133
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,950
Looks like he's leaving.

134
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,790
- Anybody coming for it?

135
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,790
- Nope, not that I can see.

136
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,350
Nobody in sight. Could be hours.

137
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,030
Could be.

138
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,590
What do you want to do?

139
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,310
It's not my fault that Murtha's got

140
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,310
his panties in a twist.

141
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,830
It's an HR issue, Janice.

142
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,550
I read the report.

143
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,500
I'm calling again because that's

144
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,500
the wrong case file number.

145
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,350
All right? I don't know what kind of

146
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,350
shoddy stan--

147
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,020
First off, Miracle Whip

148
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,020
is not mayonnaise, okay?

149
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,510
"Looks like it" doesn't equal

150
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,510
"tastes like it."

151
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,670
Secondly, every time it's like

152
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:10,670
they gotta slather an entire jar--

153
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,950
--bastard's screwing with us now.

154
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,950
How'd he make you? What'd you do?

155
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,950
We honked our horns

156
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,950
and yelled "yoo-hoo."

157
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,030
What do you mean, what did we do?

158
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,030
This guy is slippery as hell.

159
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,270
He's been throwing every tail

160
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,270
we put on him.

161
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:27,030
- The guy's a pro.

162
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:27,030
- Yeah, well, even pros make mistakes.

163
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,870
One of these days, our pal

164
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,870
Ehrmantraut's gonna slip up.

165
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,500
Just gotta be there when he does.

166
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,550
Teenagers. Sometimes you

167
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,550
just want to strangle them.

168
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,480
How's it going?

169
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:51,070
Oh, you know. Well, this little munchkin,

170
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:51,070
I could just keep her forever.

171
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,630
She is just the sweetest

172
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,630
little baby ever born.

173
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,910
Yes, she is.

174
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,510
I don't see much of Flynn.

175
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,070
That car of his keeps him pretty busy.

176
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,640
Yeah.

177
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,670
More importantly, how are you doing?

178
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,270
I'm okay.

179
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,230
How's the therapy?

180
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:18,750
I know Dave helped me so much

181
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:18,750
when I was going through my little....

182
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,400
How's your guy?

183
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,910
- Peter.

184
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,910
- Peter.

185
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,270
He's.... Yeah, he's good.

186
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,430
I feel like I'm making progress.

187
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,350
That's great.

188
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:34,070
You know,

189
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:34,070
you just keep working through it.

190
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,270
Honey. Babe, what is it?

191
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,430
It's okay. It's all right.

192
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,630
Why don't you let me take Holly,

193
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,630
and then we'll talk about this?

194
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,390
- No.

195
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,390
- Okay. All right, that's fine.

196
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,790
Then how about you just talk to me?

197
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,870
Just tell me what's going on.

198
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,470
I just....

199
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,470
I need to make the right decision.

200
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,550
I need them to be safe.

201
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,750
The kids?

202
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,510
They're safe. Of course they are.

203
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,110
I just miss them so much.

204
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,110
I just want to be with them.

205
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,000
Hey, you know we can bring

206
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,000
them back home anytime you want.

207
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,120
No. They need to stay. But I just....

208
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,590
I don't know what to do here. I....

209
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,710
Like, whatever I choose is wrong.

210
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,390
Skyler, you gotta tell me

211
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,390
what's going on.

212
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,590
I know sometimes you--

213
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,470
I know you think I have

214
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,470
a big mouth sometimes. I....

215
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:50,110
But if you felt like you couldn't talk

216
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:50,110
to me, I don't know what I'd do.

217
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,790
Okay. So, what's this about

218
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,790
the kids not being safe?

219
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:59,310
Safe from what?

220
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,230
From us.

221
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,390
From Walt and me.

222
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,910
Like what? Like you're bad parents?

223
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,830
Because you're not. Not even close.

224
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,550
Marie...

225
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,030
...there are things

226
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,030
you just don't know...

227
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,110
...that if you knew...

228
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,110
...you'd never speak to me again.

229
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,120
Try me.

230
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,310
Okay, if you're not gonna say it, I will.

231
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,630
Skyler, you have to

232
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,630
forgive yourself for Ted.

233
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,430
- What?

234
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,430
- You can't keep beating yourself up...

235
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,110
...over some stupid little affair.

236
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,590
- Walt told you.

237
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,590
- Please don't blame him.

238
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,190
I practically forced him to,

239
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,190
and I wasn't gonna say anything.

240
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,870
But I cannot stand to watch you

241
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,870
torture yourself like this.

242
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,030
You have to forgive yourself, Skyler.

243
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,230
You were having all these problems

244
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,230
with Walt.

245
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,080
And Ted is a really good-looking man.

246
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:14,950
You're only human.

247
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:14,950
Hell, I've even thought of, you know....

248
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,790
I mean, not seriously,

249
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,790
but I totally get your temptation.

250
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,270
Yeah.

251
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,110
Doesn't it feel good

252
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,110
to get it off your chest?

253
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,430
Oh, yeah.

254
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,390
- I feel better.

255
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,390
- Yeah.

256
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,700
For those who love the taste

257
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,700
but not the price...

258
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,070
...there's simulated caviar

259
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,070
made of kelp, a type of seaweed.

260
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:56,550
A fraction of the cost, it looks, smells

261
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:56,550
and tastes similar to the real thing.

262
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,150
Ready to get back at it?

263
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,880
Unlike fish caviar--

264
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,310
We have breaking news

265
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,310
into our newsroom.

266
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,470
We've just learned that police

267
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,470
are now expanding their search...

268
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,710
...for a missing McKinley County boy

269
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,710
after four days with no leads.

270
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,960
Fourteen-year-old Drew Sharp was last

271
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,960
seen by his parents Thursday morning.

272
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,350
Authorities are extending

273
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:17,350
their search today...

274
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,470
...east from Crownpoint

275
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,470
to Hospah and Whitehorse.

276
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,750
Sharp was last seen riding his dirt bike

277
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,750
into the desert behind his house.

278
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,150
Investigators are asking any--

279
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,160
Jesse, nothing can change this.

280
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,310
- Yeah, it's just that kid's parents....

281
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:44,310
- I know. Believe me.

282
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,440
I haven't been able to sleep the

283
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:49,440
past few nights just thinking about it.

284
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,230
But, Jesse, now, finally,

285
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,230
we're self-sufficient.

286
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,430
Finally we have everything

287
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,430
that we need...

288
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,430
...and no one to answer to

289
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:59,430
except ourselves.

290
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,860
And in a year, year and a half...

291
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,110
...once we've cooked through this

292
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:07,110
methylamine and made our money...

293
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,430
...there will be plenty of time

294
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,430
for soul-searching. Until then...

295
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,070
...we keep going.

296
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,830
And we run our business our way...

297
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,630
...and make sure that this

298
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,630
never happens again.

299
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,190
Okay?

300
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,590
Look.

301
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,590
Listen, I'll finish this up.

302
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,550
Why don't you go on home?

303
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,230
- You sure?

304
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,230
- Absolutely.

305
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,590
Yeah. I'll take care of this.

306
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,630
You go on.

307
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,350
Hey.

308
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,110
Yeah, I was just leaving.

309
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,110
All right.

310
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,070
Hello? Walter?

311
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,790
What are you doing here?

312
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,470
I'm delivering the batch.

313
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,470
What are you doing here?

314
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,470
Might as well get this over with.

315
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,470
Come in. Join us.

316
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,030
- Hey.

317
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,030
- Hi.

318
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,270
Where's your cars?

319
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,830
We parked around the block.

320
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,560
You might consider

321
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,560
doing that as well.

322
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,840
Okay.

323
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:46,960
So, what's going on?

324
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,310
Just since this morning,

325
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,310
I threw three separate tails. All DEA.

326
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,510
- What?

327
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,510
- The feds have been all over me.

328
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,470
This has been going on

329
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,470
for a while now.

330
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,910
Did they follow you here?

331
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,030
No. I said I threw them.

332
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,630
I would never come to the headquarters

333
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,630
of our illegal meth operation...

334
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,510
...dragging a bunch of cops, Walter.

335
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,110
- It would be unwise.

336
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:08,110
- How can you be so sure?

337
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,630
Well, I've been doing this a long time.

338
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,630
It's pretty basic stuff.

339
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,070
How long has this been going on?

340
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,910
Since about the time we started

341
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,910
this little venture.

342
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,550
The DEA, in particular your peach

343
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,550
of a brother-in-law...

344
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,280
...has taken a keen interest

345
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,280
in my activities.

346
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,750
And you're just telling me this now?

347
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,790
What, you didn't think this information

348
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,790
would be of interest?

349
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,680
- Wouldn't be germane?

350
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,680
- I've been handling it, Walter.

351
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,950
We're sitting on a thousand gallons

352
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,950
of stolen methylamine.

353
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,110
Jesus!

354
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,110
How can you be so irresponsible?

355
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,870
Calm down, would you, please?

356
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,590
I can't believe that you kept this from

357
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,590
me. From us. Did you know about this?

358
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,670
- Mike just told me.

359
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,670
- And I said calm down.

360
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,030
- I've got it under control.

361
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,030
- Oh, well, forgive me...

362
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,750
...for not having complete confidence.

363
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,270
- You know this can't go on, right?

364
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,270
- Yeah, I know.

365
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,390
And I've already decided.

366
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,790
I'm out.

367
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,190
Okay. Well....

368
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,870
Sorry to see you go, Mike.

369
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,430
But I really don't see any other way.

370
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,030
Neither do I.

371
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,630
Obviously, Jesse...

372
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,550
...you'll have to take over

373
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,550
the distribution end of things.

374
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:30,790
Mike, I trust that you'll bring Jesse up

375
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:30,790
to speed on your side of the business?

376
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,470
Yeah, about that....

377
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,550
Actually, Mr. White...

378
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,790
...I'm out too.

379
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,310
You're what?

380
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,790
I don't think I can do this anymore.

381
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,310
So...

382
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,640
...I'm retiring, I guess.

383
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,790
That methylamine that we stole, that we

384
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,790
nearly killed ourselves trying to steal?

385
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,310
That methylamine, when cooked,

386
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,310
is worth nearly $300 million.

387
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,830
And you're telling me that you're willing

388
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,830
to walk away from that?

389
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,910
We're walking away from the meth.

390
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,630
Not the methylamine.

391
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,470
Jesse and I will be taking

392
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,470
our two-thirds and selling it.

393
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,670
I've got a connection,

394
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,670
a guy I knew from my time with Fring.

395
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:22,040
This guy has the capital,

396
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:22,040
and he's motivated. Highly.

397
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,510
Mike's thinking we'll clear

398
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,510
like 5 million. Each.

399
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,870
I'll pay off my guys in lock-up

400
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:28,870
out of my share.

401
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:33,310
And those legacy costs you're so fond of

402
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:33,310
you won't have to worry about anymore.

403
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,990
And then I will be going on my way.

404
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,510
Jesse too.

405
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,990
It's a solid plan.

406
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,230
You can come in on this with us.

407
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,320
That'd be cool.

408
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:51,310
Course, you know,

409
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:51,310
you are free to hold onto your third...

410
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,070
...and keep cooking.

411
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,790
You'll be selling to my competitors.

412
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,510
This guy and his crew

413
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,510
are way out in Phoenix.

414
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,270
It's a big country, Walter.

415
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,350
Whole lot of meth-heads.

416
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,710
Pennies on the dollar, Jesse.

417
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,110
And that's what you're

418
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,110
gonna sell out for?

419
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,190
Pennies? Why?

420
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,270
Five million isn't pennies.

421
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,110
It's more money than I've ever seen.

422
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,110
And when it comes down to it...

423
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,430
...are we in the meth business?

424
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,710
Or the money business?

425
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,940
Relax, kid. There's no one there.

426
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,910
You sure?

427
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,350
I wouldn't be here if I wasn't.

428
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,190
Glad to see you could make it out.

429
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,550
I was surprised to get your call.

430
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,750
Good surprise, I hope.

431
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,150
There's one gallon, as discussed.

432
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,670
You take that back home

433
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,670
to your people, test it.

434
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,350
If you're satisfied,

435
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,350
I can get the other 665.

436
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,030
All right. That's fair enough.

437
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,990
Shall we talk money?

438
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,320
That one's free.

439
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,070
The price for the rest

440
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,070
is 15,000 per.

441
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:50,030
Six hundred and sixty-five gallons,

442
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:50,030
that's 9,975,000.

443
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,430
Although I would prefer

444
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,430
you round it up to 10.

445
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,710
Makes it easier for my partner

446
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,710
and I to split.

447
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,910
Steep.

448
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,550
We good?

449
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,190
I'll talk to my guys, but I should be

450
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,190
able to put together that cash, yeah.

451
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,790
Good.

452
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,310
I gotta tell you, this is worth it just to get

453
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,310
that blue stuff of yours off the market.

454
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,790
The blue stuff will be

455
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,790
off the market, right?

456
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,150
Now, this whole time,

457
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,150
I was thinking 666...

458
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,110
...that seems like an odd number.

459
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,110
Two-thirds of an even

460
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,110
thousand, though.

461
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,070
When I look at it that way,

462
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:37,070
it starts to make sense to me.

463
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,230
That's not all the methylamine, is it?

464
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,760
You two have a partner

465
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,760
you haven't mentioned?

466
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,900
This other party

467
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,900
wouldn't be a problem for you.

468
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,270
- His territory won't impact yours.

469
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,270
- You see, that doesn't work for me.

470
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,790
I'm not just buying this for the supply.

471
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,790
I'm buying this for the demand.

472
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,910
I'm looking to increase

473
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,910
my market share.

474
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,070
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

475
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,200
I want you to tell me that Fring's blue

476
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,200
will be off the streets.

477
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,310
All right.

478
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,310
Here's a new deal for you then.

479
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,910
I'll pay you 15K a gallon

480
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,910
for the full thousand gallons.

481
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,950
Not a drop less.

482
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,070
It's not mine to sell, Declan.

483
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,190
Well, then, no deal, Mike.

484
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,990
Yes?

485
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,750
Yes. I guess.

486
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,590
I don't know.

487
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,030
Why don't you come over here?

488
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,480
To my house.

489
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,150
Yes, seriously.

490
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,070
Hey.

491
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,790
Yo, you sure this is okay?

492
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,070
She's not here. Nobody's here.

493
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,070
All right. So....

494
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,980
Something's come up.

495
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,590
Mike wanted to come here

496
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,590
to give you the hard sell...

497
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,190
...but I figured it'd be better

498
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,190
coming from me.

499
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,070
Mike's connection won't buy

500
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,070
mine and Mike's shares...

501
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,880
...of the methylamine

502
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,880
unless he gets your share too.

503
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,800
He wants the entire thousand gallons.

504
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,190
Absolutely not.

505
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,640
Yeah, I figured you'd say that.

506
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,110
But I've been thinking about it...

507
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:05,230
...and it really makes sense.

508
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,670
- Kind of.

509
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,670
- It does, does it?

510
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,590
Look, when you started this thing...

511
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,190
...did you ever dream

512
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,190
of having $5 million?

513
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,590
I know for a fact that you didn't.

514
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:21,030
I know for a fact all you needed

515
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:21,030
was 737,000...

516
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,920
...because you worked it all out,

517
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,920
like, mathematically.

518
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,430
Look, if selling the methylamine now

519
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,430
means that no one else ever gets killed...

520
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,390
...then I vote for that, man.

521
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,390
Hands down.

522
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,990
And we could have it tomorrow.

523
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,990
We would be out.

524
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,510
Spend time with your family. No more

525
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,510
worrying about them getting hurt...

526
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,550
...or finding out about everything.

527
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,550
Isn't this what you've been working for?

528
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,150
I have not been working

529
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:44,150
this hard just to sell out.

530
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,990
- It's not selling out.

531
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,990
- Yes, it is, Jesse.

532
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,470
I have-- We have suffered

533
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,470
and bled, literally, for this business.

534
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,150
And I will not throw it away for nothing.

535
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,350
I don't know how else to say it,

536
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,350
Mr. White.

537
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,950
Five million dollars isn't nothing.

538
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,310
Jesse, have you heard of a company

539
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,310
called Gray Matter?

540
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,590
- No.

541
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:13,590
- Well, I co-founded it...

542
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,270
...in grad school with a couple

543
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,270
of friends of mine.

544
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,710
Actually, I was the one who named it.

545
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,480
And back then, it was just--

546
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,480
Oh, it was just small-time.

547
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,710
We had a couple patents pending.

548
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,270
But nothing earth-shattering.

549
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:29,910
Course, we all knew the potential.

550
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,470
Yeah, we were gonna take

551
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,470
the world by storm.

552
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,710
And then this....

553
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,790
Well, something happened

554
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,790
between the three of us.

555
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:45,270
And I'm not gonna go into detail.

556
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,350
But for personal reasons

557
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,350
I decided to leave the company.

558
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,630
And I sold my share

559
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,630
to my two partners.

560
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,110
I took a buyout for $5000.

561
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:00,470
Now, at the time,

562
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:00,470
that was a lot of money for me.

563
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,350
Care to guess what that company

564
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,350
is worth now?

565
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,150
Millions?

566
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,710
Billions, with a "B."

567
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,910
Two-point-one-six billion

568
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,910
as of last Friday.

569
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:17,190
I look it up every week.

570
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,520
And I sold my share...

571
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:24,950
...my potential, for $5000.

572
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,470
I sold my kids' birthright

573
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,470
for a few months' rent.

574
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,430
This isn't the same thing.

575
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,110
Jesse, you asked me...

576
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:43,060
...if I was in the meth business

577
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:43,060
or the money business.

578
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,720
Neither.

579
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,110
I'm in the empire business.

580
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,990
I don't know.

581
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:01,710
Mr. White, is a meth empire

582
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:01,710
really something to be that proud of?

583
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,190
Skyler, you remember Jesse.

584
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,750
Jesse, this is my wife, Skyler.

585
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,480
Hey, Mrs. White. Good to see you.

586
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,990
You have a lovely home.

587
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,880
- I was just heading out.

588
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,880
- Why don't you stay for dinner?

589
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,680
- No, Mr. White. I'm gonna go.

590
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,680
- Stay.

591
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,110
Come on. It'll be fun.

592
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,030
It's okay with us, isn't it, Skyler?

593
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,870
We don't have anything special

594
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,870
planned tonight.

595
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,510
Yeah.

596
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,990
Sure.

597
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,670
Why not?

598
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,880
See?

599
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,670
These are great green beans,

600
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,670
Mrs. White.

601
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,670
I like that you got

602
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,670
the slivered almonds going.

603
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,630
My mom always made them like that.

604
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,200
You put lemon in there too?

605
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:36,070
They are from the deli at Albertsons.

606
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,390
Well...

607
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,790
...you know, good work

608
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:45,790
on your shopping then.

609
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,430
Because these are choice.

610
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,820
I eat a lot of frozen stuff.

611
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:11,030
It's usually pretty bad.

612
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,630
I mean, the pictures

613
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,630
are always so awesome, you know?

614
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,520
It's like, "Hell, yeah,

615
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,520
I'm stoked for this lasagna."

616
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,230
And then you nuke it,

617
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,230
and the cheese gets all scabby on top...

618
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,470
...and it's like you're eating a scab.

619
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,750
I mean, seriously, what's that about?

620
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,830
It's like, yo, whatever happened

621
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,830
to truth in advertising?

622
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,590
You know?

623
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,110
Yeah, it's bad.

624
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,910
So, hey, how's business?

625
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,150
The car wash.

626
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:56,150
Mr. White said it's going really well.

627
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,190
Says, like, you're a great manager.

628
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,470
He did, huh?

629
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,950
Yeah, he says you've

630
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,950
got it running like a....

631
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,230
Like a machine. Like, well-oiled.

632
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,910
Yeah.

633
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,270
What else did he tell you about me?

634
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,270
Oh, you know, just good stuff.

635
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,160
Just really, you know,

636
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,160
really good, good stuff.

637
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,040
We don't really talk that much about...

638
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,830
...you know, personal things.

639
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,630
Did you also tell him about my affair?

640
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,670
May I please be excused?

641
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,390
You know my kids are gone?

642
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,070
Thank God.

643
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,160
No. I don't mean

644
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,160
they're out for the night.

645
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,510
They're gone.

646
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,510
They're staying with my in-laws.

647
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,710
She made me kick

648
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,710
my own kids out of the house.

649
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,190
She told me...

650
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:42,830
...that she was counting the days

651
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:42,830
until my cancer came back.

652
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,230
My wife is waiting for me to die.

653
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,990
This business is all I have left now.

654
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,550
It's all I have.

655
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,590
And you want to take it away from me.

656
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,640
I thought you might try

657
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,640
something stupid.

658
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,830
- Look, Mike--

659
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,830
- Don't bother, Walter.

660
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,150
Come join me in the office.

661
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,280
I don't think so.

662
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,070
That's not a request.

663
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,150
Might as well get comfortable.

664
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:56,150
This deal's going down tomorrow.

665
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,990
It's happening, and there's nothing

666
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,990
you can do to stop it.

667
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,230
- Got it?

668
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,230
- So it's okay for you to steal my--

669
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,910
To ensure that,

670
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,910
you and I are gonna spend...

671
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,950
...the rest of the night together

672
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,950
in this office.

673
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,350
- Like it's my birthday.

674
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,350
- Mike....

675
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,550
When the deal is done,

676
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,550
you'll get your money. I guarantee that.

677
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,680
Let me cook it.

678
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,680
I'll double your five and you still walk.

679
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:20,590
You know, I have never seen anybody

680
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:20,590
work so hard not to get $5 million.

681
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,190
Mike, you need to listen to me.

682
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,680
No, Walter. The last thing I need to do

683
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,680
is listen to you. Now, sit down.

684
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,950
All right.

685
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,870
Walter, I've got a bit

686
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,870
of a quandary here.

687
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,870
I've got something I need to attend to

688
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,870
before this deal happens.

689
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,670
But for some reason, I don't trust you

690
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,670
alone with the methylamine.

691
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,030
I'm gonna have to restrain you.

692
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,630
You gotta be kidding.

693
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,590
Stand up for me, please.

694
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,150
Stand up.

695
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,550
Turn around for me.

696
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,000
Arms out to the side. Up.

697
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,190
- Oh, man.

698
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,190
- Sit down.

699
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,310
Sit down.

700
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,870
Give me your wrist.

701
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,780
Sorry.

702
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,310
Alrighty.

703
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,310
To what do we owe the pleasure?

704
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:02,630
Well, gentlemen, we're here to discuss

705
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:02,630
your illegal harassment of my client.

706
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,300
This should be good.

707
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,260
Mr. Ehrmantraut has become

708
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:08,260
the subject of a vicious, relentless...

709
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,520
...and unwarranted DEA persecution.

710
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:17,470
- Gomie, does that sound right to you?

711
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:17,470
- I have no idea what he's talking about.

712
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,350
Play it as cool as you like, Fonzie.

713
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,670
But we all know you've been following

714
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,670
my client day and night.

715
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,560
The man can't spend a few minutes

716
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,560
with his granddaughter...

717
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,310
...without you guys quivering

718
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,310
in the bushes...

719
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:33,680
...and peeping through your binoculars.

720
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:33,680
It's.... Well, it's disturbing.

721
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:38,430
And it's taken a toll on his mental

722
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:38,430
and physical well-being.

723
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:40,760
Your client looks fine to me.

724
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,070
Well, some hurts only show

725
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,070
on the inside.

726
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:49,190
Now, you guys don't even have

727
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:49,190
warrants for these tails, do you?

728
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,870
Theoretically,

729
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,870
these tails you refer to would be...

730
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,550
...within the bounds of the law.

731
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,150
We don't need a warrant to follow

732
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,150
somebody through a public place.

733
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:01,030
- Theoretically.

734
00:43:57,360 --> 00:44:01,030
- Yeah, that is theoretically correct.

735
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:05,430
However, I would counter that an

736
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:05,430
open-ended, unrestricted surveillance...

737
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:09,110
...like this amounts to stalking.

738
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,830
Which is illegal.

739
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,500
Now, I don't know what it is

740
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,500
you find so interesting...

741
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,510
...about my client,

742
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:16,510
and I'm not here to judge.

743
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:20,720
Different strokes and all.

744
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:20,720
But sadly, he's just not that into you.

745
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,030
So I have filed for a temporary

746
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,030
restraining order...

747
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:29,400
...against the DEA

748
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:29,400
on behalf of Mr. Ehrmantraut.

749
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,620
Where'd you get your law degree,

750
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,620
Goodman?

751
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,790
The same clown college

752
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,790
you got that suit?

753
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,950
You know who likes this suit?

754
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,950
Judge Papadoumian.

755
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,910
She thinks I'm a snappy dresser.

756
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,990
You know what

757
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,990
Judge Papadoumian hates?

758
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,870
Police harassment of a senior citizen.

759
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,110
Sorry.

760
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,310
Expect a visit from the sheriff, agents.

761
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,230
You should have your ex parte

762
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,230
within the hour.

763
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,190
Let's go.

764
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,350
What kind ofjudge

765
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,350
would issue this thing?

766
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,950
Papadoumian, man.

767
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,950
She's like Ho Chi Minh.

768
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,710
So, what do we do?

769
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:17,190
Well, not a lot of choice, you know?

770
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:17,190
We back off.

771
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,830
For the moment. TRO won't stand up

772
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,830
and Goodman knows it.

773
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,990
I don't see what they're playing at here,

774
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,990
but if Ehrmantraut wants a fight...

775
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,470
- ...he's gonna get one.

776
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,470
- All right.

777
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,950
- That was a hell of a gamble.

778
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,950
- Worked.

779
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,750
Yeah, well, not for long.

780
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,590
And he's right about that TRO.

781
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,590
It's gonna get tossed tout de suite.

782
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:40,310
Meanwhile, Schrader's hard-on for you

783
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:40,310
just reached Uncle Miltie proportions.

784
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,030
So have fun with that.

785
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:43,990
How much time I got?

786
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,950
Maybe 24 hours.

787
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,960
It's enough.

788
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:52,310
It better be. Whatever you got planned,

789
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:52,310
you best pull the ripcord...

790
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,230
...while you still have a chance.

791
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,390
- Where is it?

792
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,390
- Mike....

793
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,880
- Mike!

794
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,880
- Get out of my way.

795
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,400
You sit down.

796
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,070
- Mike! Mike! Hold on, okay?

797
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,070
- I am gonna count to three.

798
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,270
Mr. White's got an idea.

799
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:17,270
Mike, I'm serious.

800
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,030
- One. Two.

801
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,030
- It's a great idea.

802
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:23,080
Look, you get your 5 million, we both do,

803
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:23,080
and he gets his methylamine, all right?

804
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:24,670
Just hear him out.

805
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:31,640
Is that true, Walter?

806
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:37,990
Everybody wins.
