IT'S GOT TO
BE THE MOUNTAIN.
HE'S THE BIGGEST.

5

- HE'S THE STRONGEST.
- BULLS ARE BIGGER THAN LIONS.

6
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,544
DOESN'T MEAN I'D PICK
A BULL IN A FIGHT.

7

IF THE BULL HAD FANGS
AND CLAWS, I WOULD.

8

LORAS TYRELL.
HE'S PRETTIER
THAN THE QUEEN.

12
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,769
I DON'T CARE ABOUT PRETTY.
HE'S BETTER WITH A SWORD
THAN ANY OF THEM.

13
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,105
HOW GOOD COULD HE BE?

14
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:29,691

OF COURSE, YOUR GRACE.

WILL BE USEFUL.

- WE'RE NOT TORTURING THEM.

THE HIGH ROAD'S VERY PRETTY,

BUT YOU'LL HAVE A HARD TIME
MARCHING YOUR ARMY DOWN IT.

THE LANNISTERS HOLD
PRISONERS OF THEIR OWN.

MORE THAN THIS CUB.

MOUTH AND LIE DOWN.
YOU DON'T WANT TO WATCH.

- NO! YOU CAN'T!
- BITE ON IT.

76
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,630

YOU KNOW MY FAMILY NAME.
YOU HAVE ME AT A DISADVANTAGE.

00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,844
THAT BOY LOST HIS FOOT
ON YOUR ORDERS.

84
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,888
THEY KILLED MY FATHER.

85
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,724
- THAT BOY DID?
- THE FAMILY HE FIGHTS FOR.

86
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,977
DO YOU THINK HE'S FRIENDS
WITH KING JOFFREY?

87
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,605
<i>HE'S A FISHERMAN'S SON</i>
<i>THAT GREW UP NEAR LANNISPORT.</i>

88
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:40,483
HE PROBABLY NEVER HELD A SPEAR
BEFORE THEY SHOVED ONE IN HIS
HANDS A FEW MONTHS AGO.

89

I HAVE NO HATRED

91
00:06:44,695 --> 00:06:46,531
THAT SHOULD HELP
HIS FOOT GROW BACK.

YOU'D HAVE US SURRENDER,
END ALL THIS BLOODSHED.

93
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:55,998
I UNDERSTAND.
THE COUNTRY WOULD
BE AT PEACE

94
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:59,335
AND LIFE WOULD BE JUST
UNDER THE RIGHTEOUS HAND
OF GOOD KING JOFFREY.

95

- YOU'RE GOING TO KILL JOFFREY?
- IF THE GODS GIVE ME STRENGTH.

96

- AND THEN WHAT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

YOU'RE FIGHTING

AND YET YOU HAVE NO PLAN
FOR WHAT COMES AFTER?

103

FIRST WE HAVE
TO WIN THE WAR.

104

THE KIND WHO SERVES
HIS KING, IMP.

136
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,768

YOU THINK DIPPING HIS WICK
WILL CURE WHAT AILS HIM?

THERE'S NO CURE
FOR BEING A CUNT.

166
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,389
AND?

167
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:23,474
WHAT IS IT?

168
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:26,018
LOOK INSIDE,
YOUR GRACE.

169
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:34,443
YOUR GRACE.

170
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,405
- HAPPY NAMEDAY, YOUR GRACE.
- MY NAMEDAY HAS PASSED.

171
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:40,157
WE WON'T TELL
IF YOU WON'T.

172
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,454
NO.

173
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,248
HER.

174
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,752
TOUCH HER.

( breathing heavily )

177
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,984
COULD YOU HIT HER?

178
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,779
( laughs )

179
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,999
MY UNCLE SENT YOU?

180
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,168
YES, YOUR GRACE.

181
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,461
HE CHOSE US HIMSELF.

182
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,296
HMM.

-<i> ( slapping )</i>

HARDER.

<i>( whimpers )</i>

187
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:09,121
I SAID HARDER.

188
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,792
HE'D WANT ME TO GET
HIS MONEY'S WORTH.

189

( whimpering, crying )

192
00:13:56,126 --> 00:14:00,130
YOUR GRACE, TOO MUCH PAIN
WILL SPOIL THE PLEASURE.

<i>( woman whimpering )</i>
<i>PLEASE, PLEASE.</i>

00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,937
YOUR GRACE,
IF YOUR UNCLE FINDS OUT--

196
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,855
OH, I WANT HIM
TO FIND OUT.

197
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:20,150
YOU WILL BRING HER
TO HIS CHAMBERS WHEN
YOU'RE FINISHED

198
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,403
AND SHOW HIM
WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

199
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,657
OR THE SAME THING
WILL HAPPEN TO YOU.

200
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:34,999

-<i> ( thuds )</i>

204
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,814
WELL, IF IT ISN'T
MY FAVORITE WHOREMONGER.

205
00:14:58,897 --> 00:15:01,817
PRAY I HAVEN'T KEPT
YOU WAITING LONG.

206
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:06,113
YOUR GRACE.

207
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:12,077
NOW YOU DO THE LANNISTERS'
BIDDING, IS THAT IT?

208
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:15,331
TELL ME,
WAS MY BROTHER'S
BODY EVEN COLD

209
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,499
BEFORE YOU SECURED
YOUR NEWEST PATRON?

210
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,877
I'M A PRACTICAL MAN.

211
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,131
JUST NOT A LOYAL ONE.

212
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,175
<i>AND WHO WOULD YOU HAVE</i>
<i>ME BE LOYAL TO?</i>

213
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,177
YOUR BROTHER'S CORPSE?

214
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,179
( chuckles )

215
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:33,390
I DON'T LIKE YOU,
LORD BAELISH.

216
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,643
I DON'T LIKE YOUR FACE.

217
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,979
I DON'T LIKE THE WORDS
THAT COME OOZING OUT
OF YOUR MOUTH.

218
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:42,650
I DON'T WANT YOU IN MY TENT
ONE MINUTE MORE THAN NECESSARY.

219
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:45,861
SO TELL ME,
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

220
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,073
Renly:
<i>YOU CAN TRUST BRIENNE.</i>

221
00:15:49,156 --> 00:15:51,700
HER LOYALTY COMES
WITHOUT CHARGE.

222
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:56,705
YOU STILL HAVE MANY FRIENDS
AT COURT, YOUR GRACE,

223
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,250
MANY WHO BELIEVE
NED STARK ERRED

224
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,544
BY NOT SUPPORTING
YOUR CLAIM.

225
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,006
NOW I UNDERSTAND.

226
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,133
YOU KNOW I HAVE
THE NUMBERS.

227
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,761
YOU KNOW I'M MARCHING
ON KING'S LANDING.

228
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:14,139
WHEN I TAKE THE THRONE,
YOU HOPE TO RETAIN
YOUR POSITION.

229
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,060
AND YOUR HEAD.

230
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,979
I WOULD GIVE PRIORITY
TO MY HEAD.

231
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,649
<i>I UNDERSTAND THAT</i>
<i>YOU DON'T LIKE ME,</i>

232
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:26,068
AND WHILE THAT
SADDENS ME GREATLY,

233
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,696
I DID NOT COME HERE TODAY
SEEKING YOUR AFFECTION.

234
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:32,074
<i>WHEN YOU MARCH</i>
<i>ON KING'S LANDING,</i>

235
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:35,661
YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF FACING
A PROTRACTED SIEGE OR...

236
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,747
OPEN GATES.

237
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,142
YOUR GRACE.

238
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:00,936
LORD BAELISH.

239
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:04,231
ALL OF THESE TENTS
LOOK THE SAME TO ME.

240
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,734
- WOULD YOU BE SO KIND--
- IT WOULD BE MY PLEASURE.

241
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:09,528
IT TOOK ME WEEKS TO LEARN
MY WAY AROUND THE CAMP.

242
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:12,656
TWICE I WALKED IN ON OFFICERS
IN STAGES OF UNDRESS.

243
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,367
AND THE MOMENT I LEARN
WHICH TENT IS MINE,

244
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,119
WE'RE ON THE MOVE AGAIN.

245
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:18,662
YOUR TENT?

246
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,789
NOT OUR TENT?

247
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,292
THE KING SNORES, PERHAPS?

248
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,462
OR SIMPLY PREFERS
SOLITUDE?

249
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,298
PRESSURES OF COMMAND,
NO DOUBT.

250
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:32,009
FOUR KINGS VYING
FOR THE THRONE.

251
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:34,386
I AM NOT TUTORED
IN WARFARE,

252
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:38,140
BUT BASIC ARITHMETIC
FAVORS THE SIDE WITH
THE GREATER NUMBERS.

253
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:43,145
IF WAR WERE ARITHMETIC,
THE MATHEMATICIANS WOULD
RULE THE WORLD.

254
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:46,273
I DID NOTICE YOUR BROTHER
ENTERING HIS GRACE'S TENT
JUST NOW.

255
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,567
THE PLACE OF A KINGSGUARD
IS BY THE KING'S SIDE.

256
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,652
AND ON THE NIGHT
OF THE YOUR WEDDING,

257
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,363
WHO WAS BY
THE KING'S SIDE THEN?

258
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,657
YOU SEEM QUITE INTERESTED
IN OUR MARRIAGE.

259
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,202
YOUR MARRIAGE
IS QUITE INTERESTING...

260
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:01,288
NOT ONLY TO ME,
BUT TO THE REALM.

261
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:04,458
THE MARRIAGE OF A WEALTHY GIRL
ALWAYS BREEDS INTEREST,

262
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:06,543
IF NOTHING ELSE.

263
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:08,712
YOU'VE NEVER MARRIED,
HAVE YOU?

264
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:13,091
I'VE BEEN UNLUCKY
IN MY AFFECTIONS, SADLY.

265
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,511
THAT IS SAD.

266
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,221
THOUGH PERHAPS
IT'S FOR THE BEST.

267
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,515
THE WHOLE NOTION
OF MARRIAGE SEEMS
TO CONFUSE YOU,

268
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,850
SO ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN.

269
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:26,021
MY HUSBAND IS MY KING,
AND MY KING IS MY HUSBAND.

270
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,775
HERE IS YOUR TENT,
LORD BAELISH.
GOOD NIGHT.

WHAT DO YOU KNOW
OF THIS PLACE?

275
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,626
ONLY THAT THE DESERT
AROUND THEIR WALLS

276
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,588
IS CALLED
THE GARDEN OF BONES.

277
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,632
EVERY TIME THE QARTHEEN
SHUT THEIR GATES
ON A TRAVELER,

278
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:37,885
THE GARDEN GROWS.

279
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:50,272
- ( man coughing )
- ( man #2 groans )

280
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:53,317
- Man #3: GO ON!
- Man #4: YOU, KEEP MOVING!

-<i> ( screams )</i>
<i>- Man: BRING HER ABOUT!</i>

283
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,787
WHAT KIND OF FIRE
MELTS STONE?

284
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,915
DRAGON FIRE.

285
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,541
THERE'S DRAGONS HERE?

286
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,169
NO, ALL THE DRAGONS
ARE DEAD.

287
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,338
WHAT'S THAT SMELL?

288
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,217
DEAD PEOPLE.

289
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,511
MOVE.

290
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:31,480

MY SISTER
WAS THREE DAYS AGO.

301

MY HUSBAND,
THE DAY BEFORE THAT.

HOW DARE YOU?

YOU MAY HAVE HEARD
FALSE REPORTS.

317
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,745
- YOU BETRAYED NED.
-<i> BETRAYED?</i>

318
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,747
I WANTED HIM TO SERVE
AS PROTECTOR OF THE REALM.

319
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,415
I BEGGED HIM
TO SEIZE THE MOMENT.

320
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:17,586
I TRUSTED YOU.
MY HUSBAND TRUSTED YOU.

321
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,797
AND YOU REPAID OUR FAITH
WITH TREACHERY.

322
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,049
- NO, MY LADY.
- GET OUT!

323

324
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,928
I'VE LOVED YOU
SINCE I WAS A BOY.

325
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:30,932
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT FATE
HAS GIVEN US THIS CHANCE--

00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:34,478
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?
GET OUT!

327

SANSA, MORE BEAUTIFUL

329
00:22:56,083 --> 00:23:00,212
AND ARYA,
JUST AS WILD AS EVER.

330
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,464
YOU HAVE ARYA, TOO?

331
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:06,468
BOTH GIRLS ARE HEALTHY

<i>FOR NOW.</i>

333
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,517
BUT YOU KNOW THE QUEEN
AND YOU KNOW JOFFREY.

334
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,478
I FEAR FOR
THEIR LONGEVITY

335
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,688
IF THEY REMAIN
IN THE CAPITAL.

WHAT DO YOU WANT?

338
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:46,007
THE LANNISTERS WILL
TRADE YOUR DAUGHTERS
FOR THE KINGSLAYER.

339
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:47,676
OF COURSE THEY WILL.

340
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,303
JAIME LANNISTER
FOR TWO GIRLS?

341
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:52,013
ROBB WILL NEVER AGREE
TO THOSE TERMS.

342
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,224
I'M NOT BRINGING
THESE TERMS TO HIM.

343
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:56,351
I'M BRINGING THEM
TO YOU.

344
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:58,770
YOU THINK I'D KEEP
SECRETS FROM MY SON?

345
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,940
ROBB HAS SURPRISED THEM ALL
WITH HIS SKILLS IN BATTLE,

346
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:03,900
BUT HE'S NOT A MOTHER.

347
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:06,695
<i>CONSIDER IT, CAT.</i>

348
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,614
<i>YOU MAY NOT GET</i>
<i>ANOTHER CHANCE.</i>

349
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:16,538
- I'VE BROUGHT YOU A GIFT.
- I DON'T WANT YOUR GIFTS.

350
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:19,875
A TOKEN OF TYRION
LANNISTER'S GOODWILL.

351
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:24,004
HE WANTS YOU TO
UNDERSTAND THAT THIS
EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS

352
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,964
IS OFFERED IN GOOD FAITH.

353
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:28,049
GOOD FAITH?

354
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,514
WHAT'S THIS?

355
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,254
YOUR HUSBAND WAS
AN HONORABLE MAN.

356
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:10,008
HE SHOULD REST BESIDE
HIS FAMILY IN THE CRYPTS
BENEATH WINTERFELL.

357
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:17,015
- YOU MAY NOT BELIEVE--
- GET OUT.

358
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,581
( groans )

359
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,550
-<i> ( men shouting )</i>
<i>- Man: GET UP, YOU DOGS!</i>

360
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:55,136
<i>( wood banging )</i>

361
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:06,398
THAT'S HIM,
THE ONE WHO PICKS.

362
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,733
THE MOUNTAIN.

363
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:13,655
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

364
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,907
HE TOLD ME HE STARES
AT HIM EVERY DAY.

365
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,285
THAT'S WHY HE
DOESN'T GET PICKED.

366
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,312
YOU.

367
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:47,856
Man:
<i>MOVE, BOY!</i>

368
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,567
MOVE!

369
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,783
<i>( liquid trickling )</i>

370
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:11,212
Tickler:
<i>IS THERE GOLD AND SILVER</i>
<i>IN THE VILLAGE?</i>

371
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,757
- I DON'T KNOW.
-<i> GEMS?</i>

372
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,884
I DIDN'T SEE ANY.

373
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:18,428
- WHERE IS THE BROTHERHOOD?
- I DON'T KNOW.

374
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,853
<i>( rats squeaking )</i>

375
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:30,523
( squeaking )

376
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,988
- Tickler:
<i>WHERE IS THE BROTHERHOOD?</i>
<i>- I DON'T KNOW. PLEASE.</i>

377
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,783
- WHERE IS THE BROTHERHOOD?
- I DON'T KNOW.

378

-<i> ( rat squeaking )</i>
<i>- ( whimpering )</i>

379
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:47,332
WHICH OF THE VILLAGERS
AIDED THEM?

380
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:49,959
- I DON'T KNOW.
- WHO?

381
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,087
I--

382
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:57,801
- WHO?
- I NEVER SAW.

383
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,552
- WHO?
- I NEVER SAW.

384
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:02,806
PLEASE. PLEASE, STOP.
PLEASE, IT'S STARTING TO--

385
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:06,142
-<i> WHO?</i>
<i>- I DIDN'T SEE</i>
<i>ANYONE HELP HIM.</i>

386
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,520
-<i> ( rat shrieking )</i>
<i>- TAKE IT OFF!</i>
<i>TAKE IT OFF!</i>

387
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,855
-<i> WHO HELPED HIM?</i>
<i>- GANES THE BUTCHER</i>

388
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:12,816
- AND HIS SON.
- THAT'S BETTER.

389
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:15,985
-<i> YOU'VE BEEN VERY HELPFUL.</i>
<i>- NO, STOP, PLEASE!</i>

390
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:18,613
<i>WHAT ARE YOU DOING?</i>
<i>PLEASE, STOP!</i>

391
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:20,990
<i>PLEASE, STOP!</i>
<i>NO! NO!</i>

392
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,201
I TOLD YOU EVERYTHING!
NO!

393
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:26,579
- NO! ( screaming )
-<i> ( rat clattering )</i>

394
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:29,916
JOFFREY.

395
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:31,960
CERSEI.

396
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,462
ILYN PAYNE.
THE HOUND.

397
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,340
Woman:
<i>PLEASE, POLLIVER.</i>
<i>SOME FOOD.</i>

398
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:40,218
JUST A CRUST OF BREAD.

399
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:44,472
<i>( woman crying )</i>

400
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,433
POLLIVER.

401
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,685
THE MOUNTAIN.

402
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,996
LADY STARK, I HAD NOT
THOUGHT TO FIND YOU
IN THE STORMLANDS.

403
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,499
I HAD NOT THOUGHT
TO BE HERE, LORD STANNIS.

404
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:15,003
- CAN THAT TRULY BE YOU?
- WHO ELSE MIGHT IT BE?

405
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,755
WHEN I SAW YOUR STANDARD,
I COULDN'T BE SURE.

406
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,216
- WHOSE BANNER IS THAT?
- MY OWN.

407
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,969
I SUPPOSE IF WE USED
THE SAME ONE,

408
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:25,763
THE BATTLE WOULD BE
TERRIBLY CONFUSING.

409
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:29,017
<i>WHY IS YOUR STAG</i>
<i>ON FIRE?</i>

410
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,685
THE KING HAS TAKEN
FOR HIS SIGIL

411
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:32,604
THE FIERY HEART
OF THE LORD OF LIGHT.

412
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:37,192
AH, YOU MUST BE THIS
FIRE PRIESTESS WE HEAR
SO MUCH ABOUT.

413
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,527
<i>MM, BROTHER,</i>

414
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:42,822
NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU FOUND RELIGION
IN YOUR OLD AGE.

415
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,073
WATCH YOURSELF, RENLY.

416
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:47,368
Renly:
<i>NO, NO, I'M RELIEVED.</i>

417
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,454
I NEVER REALLY BELIEVED
YOU'RE A FANATIC.

418
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:52,957
CHARMLESS, RIGID,
A BORE, YES,

419
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,709
BUT NOT A GODLY MAN.

420
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:57,003
YOU SHOULD KNEEL
BEFORE YOUR BROTHER.

421
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:59,380
HE'S THE LORD'S CHOSEN,

422
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,841
<i>BORN AMIDST SALT</i>
<i>AND SMOKE.</i>

423
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,927
BORN AMIDST SALT
AND SMOKE?

424
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,345
IS HE A HAM?

425
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:07,222
Stannis:
<i>THAT'S TWICE</i>
<i>I'VE WARNED YOU.</i>

426
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,224
LISTEN TO YOURSELVES.

427
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:12,519
IF YOU WERE SONS
OF MINE, I WOULD KNOCK
YOUR HEADS TOGETHER

428
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:15,688
AND LOCK YOU IN A BEDCHAMBER
UNTIL YOU REMEMBERED THAT
YOU WERE BROTHERS.

429
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:18,399
IT IS STRANGE TO FIND YOU
BESIDE MY BROTHER, LADY STARK.

430
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,236
<i>YOUR HUSBAND WAS A SUPPORTER</i>
<i>OF MY CLAIM.</i>

431
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,530
LORD EDDARD'S INTEGRITY
COST HIM HIS HEAD.

432
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:26,491
AND YOU SIT
BESIDE THIS PRETENDER
AND CHASTISE ME.

433
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:28,076
WE SHARE A COMMON ENEMY.

434
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,955
THE IRON THRONE
IS MINE BY RIGHT.

435
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:35,458
ALL THOSE THAT DENY THAT
ARE MY FOES.

436
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:38,628
THE WHOLE REALM DENIES IT,
FROM DORNE TO THE WALL.

437
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:40,505
OLD MEN DENY IT
WITH THEIR DEATH RATTLE

438
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:43,466
AND UNBORN CHILDREN DENY IT
IN THEIR MOTHER'S WOMBS.

439
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:47,470
NO ONE WANTS YOU
FOR THEIR KING.

440
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:50,765
<i>YOU NEVER WANTED</i>
<i>ANY FRIENDS, BROTHER.</i>

441
00:30:50,848 --> 00:30:53,393
<i>BUT A MAN WITHOUT FRIENDS</i>
<i>IS A MAN WITHOUT POWER.</i>

442
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:56,771
FOR THE SAKE OF THE MOTHER
WHO BORE US,

443
00:30:56,854 --> 00:30:59,190
I WILL GIVE YOU
THIS ONE NIGHT
TO RECONSIDER.

444
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:02,068
STRIKE YOUR BANNERS,

445
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:04,445
COME TO ME BEFORE DAWN,

446
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,448
AND I WILL GRANT YOU
YOUR OLD SEAT IN THE COUNCIL.

447
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:11,452
I'LL EVEN NAME YOU
MY HEIR

448
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,496
UNTIL A SON
IS BORN TO ME.

449
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,667
OTHERWISE I SHALL
DESTROY YOU.

450
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,464
LOOK ACROSS
THOSE FIELDS, BROTHER.

451
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:26,009
<i>CAN YOU SEE</i>
<i>ALL THOSE BANNERS?</i>

452
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:28,970
YOU THINK A FEW BOLTS
OF CLOTH WILL MAKE YOU KING?

453
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,888
NO.

454
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:34,309
THE MEN HOLDING
THOSE BOLTS OF CLOTH
WILL MAKE ME KING.

455
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,144
WE SHALL SEE, RENLY.

456
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,813
COME THE DAWN,
WE SHALL SEE.

457
00:31:38,896 --> 00:31:41,065
LOOK TO YOUR SINS,
LORD RENLY.

458
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,735
THE NIGHT IS DARK
AND FULL OF TERRORS.

459
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:52,869
WOULD YOU BELIEVE
I LOVED HIM ONCE?

460
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,849
I THOUGHT WE WERE WELCOME.

461
00:32:14,932 --> 00:32:17,852
IF YOU HEARD A DOTHRAKI HORDE
WAS APPROACHING YOUR CITY,

462
00:32:17,935 --> 00:32:19,896
YOU MIGHT DO THE SAME,
KHALEESI.

463
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,400
HORDE?

464
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:41,042
MY NAME IS DAENERYS--

465
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,253
DAENERYS STORMBORN
OF THE HOUSE TARGARYEN.

466
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:46,297
YOU KNOW ME, MY LORD?

467
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:49,092
ONLY BY REPUTATION,
KHALEESI.

468
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:53,638
AND I'M NO LORD,
MERELY A HUMBLE MERCHANT.

469
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:56,224
THEY CALL YOU
THE MOTHER OF DRAGONS.

470
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,309
AND WHAT SHOULD
I CALL YOU?

471
00:32:58,393 --> 00:32:59,894
OH, MY NAME IS QUITE LONG

472
00:32:59,977 --> 00:33:02,563
AND QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
FOR FOREIGNERS TO PRONOUNCE.

473
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:06,234
I AM SIMPLY A TRADER
OF SPICES.

474
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:09,529
BUT WE ARE THE THIRTEEN,

475
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:13,032
CHARGED WITH THE GOVERNANCE
AND PROTECTION OF QARTH,

476
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:17,954
THE GREATEST CITY
THAT EVER WAS OR WILL BE.

477
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:22,583
- THE BEAUTY OF
QUARTH IS LEGENDARY--
- QARTH.

478
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,795
QARTH.

479
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:28,840
MIGHT WE SEE
THE DRAGONS?

480
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:36,931
MY FRIEND,

481
00:33:37,014 --> 00:33:39,475
WE HAVE TRAVELLED
VERY FAR.

482
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,811
<i>WE HAVE NO FOOD,</i>
<i>NO WATER.</i>

483
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:44,480
ONCE I SEE MY PEOPLE FED,
I WOULD BE HONORED--

484
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:47,316
FORGIVE ME,
MOTHER OF DRAGONS,

485
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,404
BUT NO MAN ALIVE HAS SEEN
A LIVING DRAGON.

486
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:53,406
SOME OF MY MORE
SKEPTICAL FRIENDS

487
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:57,118
REFUSE TO BELIEVE
YOUR CHILDREN

488
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,828
EVEN EXIST.

489
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:02,373
<i>ALL WE ASK IS THE CHANCE</i>
<i>TO SEE FOR OURSELVES.</i>

490
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,292
I AM NOT A LIAR.

491
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,627
OH, I DON'T THINK YOU ARE.

492
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,254
BUT AS I'VE NEVER
MET YOU BEFORE,

493
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:11,549
MY OPINION ON THE MATTER
IS OF LIMITED VALUE.

494
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:15,303
WHERE I COME FROM,

495
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,638
GUESTS ARE TREATED
WITH RESPECT,

496
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:20,975
NOT INSULTED
AT THE GATES.

497
00:34:21,058 --> 00:34:23,561
THEN PERHAPS YOU SHOULD
RETURN TO WHERE YOU COME FROM.

498
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:25,730
WE WISH YOU WELL.

499
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,027
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

500
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:34,030
YOU PROMISED
TO RECEIVE ME.

501
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,616
WE HAVE RECEIVED YOU.

502
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:39,494
HERE WE ARE,
AND HERE YOU ARE.

503
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:43,164
IF YOU DO NOT LET US IN,
ALL OF US WILL DIE.

504
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,958
WHICH WE SHALL
DEEPLY REGRET.

505
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:49,337
BUT QARTH DID NOT BECOME
THE GREATEST CITY THAT
EVER WAS OR WILL BE

506
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:53,007
BY LETTING DOTHRAKI SAVAGES
THROUGH ITS GATES.

507
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,766
KHALEESI, PLEASE
BE CAREFUL.

508
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:07,688
THIRTEEN!

509
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:10,233
WHEN MY DRAGONS ARE GROWN,

510
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:13,444
WE WILL TAKE BACK
WHAT WAS STOLEN FROM ME

511
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,696
AND DESTROY THOSE
WHO HAVE WRONGED ME.

512
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,366
WE WILL LAY WASTE
TO ARMIES

513
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,952
AND BURN CITIES
TO THE GROUND.

514
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:25,123
TURN US AWAY AND WE WILL
BURN YOU FIRST.

515
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,250
AH.

516
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:30,002
YOU ARE A TRUE
TARGARYEN.

517
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:33,214
ONLY, AS YOU SAID
A MOMENT AGO,

518
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,757
IF WE DON'T LET YOU
INTO THE CITY,

519
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:37,385
YOU WILL ALL DIE.
AND SO...

520
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,971
RETREATING IN FEAR
FROM A LITTLE GIRL

521
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:42,306
IS UNBECOMING
OF THE GREATEST CITY

522
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,724
THAT EVER WAS
OR WILL BE.

523
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:47,520
THE DISCUSSION IS OVER,
XARO XHOAN DAXOS.

524
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,355
THE THIRTEEN HAVE SPOKEN.

525
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:52,275
I AM ONE OF THE THIRTEEN

526
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:54,735
AND I AM STILL SPEAKING.

527
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,946
THE GIRL THREATENS TO BURN
OUR CITY TO THE GROUND

528
00:35:57,029 --> 00:36:00,241
AND YOU WOULD INVITE HER IN
FOR A CUP OF WINE?

529
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,410
SHE IS THE MOTHER
OF DRAGONS.

530
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:05,705
DO YOU EXPECT HER TO WATCH
HER PEOPLE STARVE

531
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:07,790
WITHOUT BREATHING FIRE?

532
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:10,459
<i>I BELIEVE WE CAN ALLOW</i>
<i>A FEW DOTHRAKI</i>

533
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:13,087
<i>THROUGH OUR GATES</i>
<i>WITHOUT DOOMING OUR CITY.</i>

534
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:16,465
<i>AFTER ALL, HERE I AM,</i>

535
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:18,426
A SAVAGE FROM
THE SUMMER ISLES,

536
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,344
AND QARTH STILL STANDS.

537
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:23,264
OUR DECISION IS FINAL.

538
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,600
VERY WELL.

539
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:30,438
I INVOKE<i> SOUMAI.</i>

540
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,777
<i>I WILL VOUCH FOR HER,</i>
<i>HER PEOPLE,</i>

541
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:40,323
<i>AND HER DRAGONS</i>
<i>IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW.</i>

542
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:47,955
BE IT ON YOUR HEAD.

543
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,960
WELCOME TO QARTH,
MY LADY.

544
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:44,345
Mountain:
<i>YOU.</i>

545
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:55,272
Tickler:
IS THERE GOLD OR SILVER
IN THE VILLAGE?

546
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:58,275
- I'M NOT FROM THE VILLAGE.
- WHERE IS THE BROTHERHOOD?

547
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:00,903
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT IS.

548
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:09,537
( squeaking )

549
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,752
( horses neigh )

550
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:34,478
Man:<i> YOU TWO,</i>
<i>TAKE LORD LANNISTER'S</i>
<i>THINGS TO HIS QUARTERS.</i>

551
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,105
WHAT'S THIS?

552
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:38,858
WE WEREN'T EXPECTING YOU
TILL TOMORROW, LORD TYWIN.

553
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:41,610
( chuckles )
EVIDENTLY NOT.

554
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,947
WHY ARE THESE PRISONERS
NOT IN THEIR CELLS?

555
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,283
Mountain:
<i>CELLS ARE OVERFLOWING,</i>
<i>MY LORD.</i>

556
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:49,076
Polliver:
<i>THIS LOT WON'T BE HERE LONG.</i>

557
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,370
<i>DON'T NEED</i>
<i>NO PERMANENT PLACE.</i>

558
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:54,373
AFTER WE INTERROGATE 'EM,
WE USUALLY JUST...

559
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:58,878
ARE WE SO WELL-MANNED
THAT WE CAN AFFORD TO DISCARD

560
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:01,756
ABLE YOUNG BODIES
AND SKILLED LABORERS?

561
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:14,185
YOU,
DO YOU HAVE A TRADE?

562
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,229
Gendry:
<i>SMITH, MY LORD.</i>

563
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:22,193
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?
KNEEL!

564
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:25,404
KNEEL OR I'LL CARVE
YOUR LUNGS OUT, BOY.

565
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,782
HE'LL DO NO SUCH THING.

566
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:31,535
THIS ONE'S A GIRL,
YOU IDIOT,

567
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:32,912
DRESSED AS A BOY.

568
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:35,956
- WHY?
- SAFER TO TRAVEL,
MY LORD.

569
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,000
SMART.

570
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:39,877
MORE THAN I CAN SAY
FOR THIS LOT.

571
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,797
GET THESE PRISONERS
TO WORK.

572
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,757
BRING THE GIRL.

573
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,884
I NEED A NEW
CUPBEARER.

574
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,427
Mountain:
<i>MY LORD.</i>

575
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:50,346
<i>( knocking on door )</i>

576
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,229
YOUR VISITS
ARE TOO FEW, COUSIN.

577
00:39:58,312 --> 00:39:59,730
HER GRACE,
THE QUEEN REGENT,

578
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:02,233
COMMANDS YOU TO RELEASE
GRAND MAESTER PYCELLE.

579
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:05,486
- HERE'S YOUR WARRANT.
- SO IT IS.

580
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:07,947
WILL YOU TAKE
A CUP WITH ME?

581
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,324
I FIND THAT MULLED WINE
HELPS ME SLEEP.

582
00:40:10,407 --> 00:40:12,409
<i>I AM HERE</i>
<i>AT HER GRACE'S BEHEST,</i>

583
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:14,620
NOT TO DRINK
WITH YOU, IMP.

584
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:17,706
IF MY SISTER WAS
SO CONCERNED FOR PYCELLE,

585
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,875
<i>I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT</i>
<i>SHE'D COME HERSELF.</i>

586
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,961
INSTEAD SHE SENDS YOU.

587
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:23,462
WHAT AM I TO MAKE
OF THAT?

588
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,506
<i>I DON'T CARE</i>
<i>WHAT YOU MAKE OF IT,</i>

589
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,508
SO LONG AS YOU RELEASE
YOUR PRISONER IMMEDIATELY.

590
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:31,637
AND YOU'VE RECEIVED
THESE INSTRUCTIONS
DIRECTLY FROM CERSEI?

591
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,848
AS I SAID SEVERAL TIMES.

592
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,976
AND YOU'VE WAITED THIS LONG
TO DELIVER THE INFORMATION?

593
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:40,646
WHEN THE QUEEN REGENT
GIVES ME A COMMAND, I CARRY
IT OUT WITHOUT DELAY.

594
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,277
CERSEI MUST HAVE
GREAT TRUST IN YOU,

595
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,362
<i>ALLOWING YOU</i>
<i>INTO HER CHAMBER</i>

596
00:40:48,445 --> 00:40:51,407
DURING THE HOUR
OF THE WOLF.

597
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:58,164
THE QUEEN REGENT HAS A GREAT
MANY RESPONSIBILITIES.

598
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,748
SHE OFTEN WORKS
FROM DUSK TILL DAWN.

599
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:02,084
SHE MUST BE VERY GLAD
TO HAVE YOU HELPING HER

600
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,587
FROM DUSK TILL DAWN.

601
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:07,673
AH, LAVENDER OIL.

602
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:10,092
SHE ALWAYS
LOVED LAVENDER OIL,
EVEN AS A GIRL.

603
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,428
I AM A KNIGHT!

604
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,305
AN ANOINTED KNIGHT, YES.

605
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:17,057
TELL ME, DID CERSEI
HAVE YOU KNIGHTED

606
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:20,603
BEFORE OR AFTER SHE TOOK
YOU INTO HER BED?

607
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:23,189
WHAT?
NOTHING TO SAY?

608
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,316
NO MORE WARNINGS
FOR ME, SER?

609
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:27,276
YOU WILL WITHDRAW
THESE FILTHY ACCUSATIONS.

610
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,777
HAVE YOU EVER GIVEN
ANY THOUGHT

611
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,571
TO WHAT KING JOFFREY
WILL HAVE TO SAY

612
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:34,241
WHEN HE FINDS OUT
YOU'VE BEEN BEDDING
HIS MOTHER?

613
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,580
IT'S NOT MY FAULT!

614
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:42,208
DID SHE TAKE YOU
AGAINST YOUR WILL?

615
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,418
CAN YOU NOT DEFEND
YOURSELF, KNIGHT?

616
00:41:44,501 --> 00:41:47,588
YOUR OWN FATHER,
LORD TYWIN, WHEN I WAS
NAMED THE KING'S SQUIRE,

617
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,548
HE TOLD ME TO OBEY HER
IN EVERYTHING.

618
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,425
DID HE TELL YOU
TO FUCK HER, TOO?

619
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,803
I ONLY MEANT
I DID AS I WAS BID.

620
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:56,513
HATED EVERY
MOMENT OF IT,

621
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:58,557
IS THAT WHAT YOU'LL
HAVE ME BELIEVE?

622
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,601
A HIGH PLACE IN COURT,
A KNIGHTHOOD,

623
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:03,062
MY SISTER'S LEGS SPREADING
OPEN FOR YOU AT NIGHT.

624
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:05,522
OH, YES, IT MUST
HAVE BEEN TERRIBLE.

625
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,274
WAIT HERE.
HIS GRACE WILL WANT
TO HEAR THIS.

626
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,652
MERCY!
MERCY, MY LORD!
I BEG YOU.

627
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:11,445
SAVE IT FOR JOFFREY.
HE LOVES A GOOD GROVEL.

628
00:42:11,528 --> 00:42:14,281
MY LORD, IT WAS
YOUR SISTER'S BIDDING--
THE QUEEN.

629
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,200
I'LL LEAVE THE CITY
AT ONCE, I SWEAR.

630
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:19,328
- NO, I THINK NOT.
- MY LORD?

631
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:21,455
YOU HEARD ME.

632
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,836
MY FATHER TOLD YOU
TO OBEY MY SISTER.
OBEY HER.

633
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,340
STAY CLOSE TO HER SIDE.
KEEP HER TRUST.

634
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:33,300
PLEASURE HER
WHENEVER SHE REQUIRES.

635
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:35,344
NO ONE EVER NEED KNOW

636
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:38,931
AS LONG AS YOU KEEP
FAITH WITH ME.

637
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,309
I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT CERSEI IS DOING,

638
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,187
WHERE SHE GOES,
WHO SHE SEES,

639
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:47,815
WHAT THEY TALK OF--
EVERYTHING.

640
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,858
AND YOU WILL TELL ME.

641
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:52,319
YES, MY LORD, I WILL.

642
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,697
I SWEAR IT,
AS YOU COMMAND.

643
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,160
OH, RISE, RISE.

644
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:03,289
LET US DRINK TO
OUR UNDERSTANDING.

645
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:05,958
OH, YOU DON'T HAVE
A CUP. OH, WELL.

646
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:09,128
SMILE, COUSIN. MY SISTER
IS A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

647
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:10,671
AND IT'S ALL FOR
THE GOOD OF THE REALM.

648
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:13,507
GO BACK AND TELL HER
THAT I BEG HER FORGIVENESS,

649
00:43:13,590 --> 00:43:15,509
THAT I WANT NO MORE
CONFLICT BETWEEN US

650
00:43:15,592 --> 00:43:19,138
AND THAT HENCEFORTH
I SHALL DO NOTHING
WITHOUT HER CONSENT.

651
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,514
BUT HER DEMANDS.

652
00:43:20,597 --> 00:43:23,183
OH, I'LL GIVE HER PYCELLE.

653
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,561
- YOU WILL?
- YES, I'LL RELEASE HIM
IN THE MORNING.

654
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:27,521
<i>CERSEI CAN KEEP HIM</i>
<i>AS A PET IF SHE WANTS,</i>

655
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,523
<i>BUT I WILL NOT HAVE HIM</i>
<i>ON THE COUNCIL.</i>

656
00:43:29,606 --> 00:43:32,401
I COULD SWEAR
THAT I HAD NOT HARMED
A SINGLE HAIR ON HIS HEAD,

657
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:35,863
BUT THAT WOULD NOT,
STRICTLY SPEAKING, BE TRUE.

658
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:44,872
<i>( wood creaking )</i>

659
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,540
<i>( waves crashing )</i>

660
00:43:46,623 --> 00:43:50,210
Man:
<i>STAY WITHIN</i>
<i>ONE TABLE LENGTH.</i>

661
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:57,176
YOUR GRACE.

662
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:04,099
DO YOUR KNUCKLEBONES
BRING YOU LUCK?

663
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:09,688
WELL, LIFE'S BEEN GOOD
SINCE YOU HACKED THEM
OFF, YOUR GRACE.

664
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:12,066
AND IT'S FOUR LESS
FINGERNAILS TO CLEAN.

665
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:14,693
- FEWER.
- PARDON?

666
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:17,780
FOUR FEWER
FINGERNAILS TO CLEAN.

667
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:21,116
NEVER UNDERSTOOD
WHY YOU HAD TO WEAR THEM.

668
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,244
IT REMINDS ME
OF WHERE I COME FROM
AND WHERE I AM NOW.

669
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,164
IT REMINDS ME
OF YOUR JUSTICE.

670
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:28,749
IT WAS AN HONEST
PUNISHMENT

671
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:30,250
AND YOU WERE GOOD
WITH THE CLEAVER.

672
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:33,087
YOU WERE A HERO
AND A SMUGGLER.

673
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:36,507
A GOOD ACT DOES NOT
WASH OUT THE BAD,

674
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:39,343
NOR A BAD THE GOOD.

675
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:42,012
A LESSON I'VE TRIED
TO TEACH MY SON.

676
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:43,972
- DOES HE LISTEN?
- TO ME?

677
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:46,809
GODS, NO.

678
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:49,603
BUT IF YOUR RED WOMAN
TOLD HIM TO LEAP FROM
THE CROW'S NEST--

679
00:44:49,686 --> 00:44:51,897
SHE HAS A NAME.

680
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:57,403
I TRUST YOU'VE NOT FORGOTTEN
YOUR SMUGGLER'S TRICKS.

681
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:02,074
I'VE LIVED WITHIN
THE LAW FOR 17--

682
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:04,451
I WANT YOU TO BE
A SMUGGLER THIS TIME.

683
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:07,121
ANY SHORE, ANY NIGHT.

684
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:08,914
WHAT AM I BRINGING
ASHORE?

685
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:10,874
THE RED WOMAN.

686
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:14,253
NO ONE MUST KNOW
WHAT YOU DO

687
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:15,796
AND WE'LL NOT SPEAK
OF THIS AGAIN.

688
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:19,425
I AM TRUE TO YOUR GRACE
AND ALWAYS WILL BE,

689
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:22,261
BUT SURELY THERE ARE
OTHER WAYS, CLEANER WAYS.

690
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:24,805
CLEANER WAYS
DON'T WIN WARS.

691
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:57,546
ARE YOU AFRAID,
ONION KNIGHT?

692
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:04,970
SOMEONE ONCE TOLD ME
THE NIGHT IS DARK AND
FULL OF TERRORS.

693
00:46:05,053 --> 00:46:07,681
YOU'VE CARRIED MORE
UNPLEASANT CARGO IN YOUR TIME.

694
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,855
ARE YOU A GOOD MAN,
SER DAVOS SEAWORTH?

695
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:18,817
I'D SAY MY PARTS
ARE MIXED, MY LADY--
GOOD AND BAD.

696
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:21,320
IF HALF AN ONION
IS BLACK WITH ROT,

697
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:23,405
IT'S A ROTTEN ONION.

698
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:26,033
A MAN IS GOOD
OR HE IS EVIL.

699
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:27,951
- AND WHICH ARE YOU?
-<i> OH, GOOD.</i>

700
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:31,371
I'M A KNIGHT MYSELF
OF SORTS,

701
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:34,166
A CHAMPION OF LIGHT
AND LIFE.

702
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:37,419
WELL, THAT MUST BE
VERY NICE FOR YOU.

703
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:57,731
- DO YOU LOVE YOUR WIFE?
- I DO.

704
00:46:57,814 --> 00:47:00,150
YET YOU HAVE KNOWN
OTHER WOMEN.

705
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:01,985
DON'T TALK ABOUT MY WIFE.

706
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:06,073
I'M NOT.
I'M TALKING ABOUT
OTHER WOMEN.

707
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:08,492
LIKE ME, SER DAVOS.

708
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:14,581
YOU WANT ME.

709
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:17,584
YOU WANT TO SEE
WHAT'S BENEATH THIS ROBE.

710
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:21,838
AND YOU WILL.

711
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:28,929
STRANGE THAT
THIS LORD OF LIGHT

712
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:31,765
ASKS YOU TO WORK
IN THE SHADOWS.

713
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:35,269
SHADOWS CANNOT LIVE
IN THE DARK, SER DAVOS.

714
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,688
THEY ARE SERVANTS
OF LIGHT,

715
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:40,107
THE CHILDREN OF FIRE.

716
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:43,694
AND THE BRIGHTER THE FLAME,
THE DARKER THEY ARE.

717
00:47:43,777 --> 00:47:46,488
THESE WEREN'T HERE BEFORE.
THEY'VE BARRED THE PASSAGE.

718
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:48,031
( chuckles )

719
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:50,325
THEY CAN'T BAR
OUR PASSAGE.

720
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:56,707
GODS PROTECT US.

721
00:47:56,790 --> 00:48:00,127
THERE'S ONLY ONE GOD,
SER DAVOS,

722
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:03,046
AND HE ONLY PROTECTS
THOSE WHO SERVE HIM.

723
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,215
( gasps )

724
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:15,058
( laughs, gasps )

725
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:18,895
( moaning )

726
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:24,610
( moans )

727
00:48:44,379 --> 00:48:47,466
( screaming )

728
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:54,931
( shrieking )

729
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:01,063
( shrieking )

730
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:18,080
( growls )

731
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:25,671
