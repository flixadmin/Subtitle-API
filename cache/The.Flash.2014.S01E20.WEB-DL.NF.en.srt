We...

156
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,972
We have to access
Cisco's memories somehow.

157
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,141
Somewhere in his subconscious is the key.

158
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:20,685
-The key to what, now?
-Getting my dad out of prison.

159
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:23,021
And how are we going to do that?

160

We're gonna get Wells to confess
to killing my mom.

to see into his dream?

162
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:40,038
I got the idea from a journal article
on lucid-dream therapy.

163
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:43,249
It can be used to help people suffering
from post-traumatic stress disorder.

164

Heh. Traumatized, stressed,
check and check.

165
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:52,342

Who's gonna be lucid dreaming?

Um...

171
00:10:08,066 --> 00:10:13,404
With all of the metahumans in Central City,
people have been seeing strange things.

Things that they don't understand.

173
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:19,244
And it's really just a matter of time
before psychological issues develop.

174
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,414
And lucid dreaming will help the doctors
better understand their fears. Intriguing.

from the outside, right?

of that dream.

We're still working
on a communications interface.

178
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,263
When we dream, the middle brain lights up
with electrical activity...

179
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:42,016
...whereas the higher brain
remains dormant.

180
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,936
Once we find a way
to make both parts of the brain active...

181
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:49,107
...it's just a matter of finding the frequency
that will stimulate the language center.

182
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:50,817
Then the dreamer could speak.

183
00:10:50,984 --> 00:10:52,944
-He could describe his dream.
-Exactly.

184

This whole thing...

620
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,841
-...it's been about me?
-Not a chance.

621
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,718
You, my friend...

622
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,556
...are simply my insurance.

623
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,772
You look so young.

624
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,737
And I could kill you...

625
00:39:26,114 --> 00:39:27,198
...right now...

626
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:29,909
...so easy.

627
00:39:35,415 --> 00:39:37,625
What I wouldn't have given...

628
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:42,589
...all those times before
to have had you like this.

629
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:47,594
So helpless.

630
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,929
But fate...

631
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:53,975
Fate's tricky, isn't it?

632
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:57,186
I come here to destroy you...

633
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,568
...and then to get home,
I have to be the one who creates you.

634
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,196
[SCOFFS]

635
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,160
But I will say...

636
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:15,496
...it's been an education...

637
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:23,087
...watching you grow up all these years.
Science fairs and soccer games.

638
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:30,136
No hint, no sign, no trace
of the man you will be one day.

639
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:34,015
For whom I have nothing but hate.

640
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,726
And to be clear...

641
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:41,189
...nothing is forgiven.

642
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,108
There will be a reckoning.

643
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:47,487
I promise you, Barry Allen.

644
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,658
And you will die.
