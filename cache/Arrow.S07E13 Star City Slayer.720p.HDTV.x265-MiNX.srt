1
00:00:00,014 --> 00:00:01,820
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,235
After 6 months in hell,

3
00:00:03,236 --> 00:00:05,150
I have been released from prison
and returned home

4
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:06,310
with only one goal...

5
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,440
To save my city,
but things have changed.

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,270
Instead of operating outside the law,

7
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,480
I am now working
alongside the police.

8
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,070
I am no longer inmate 4587.

9
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,650
I am once more...

10
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,750
The Green Arrow.

11
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,450
Previously on <i>"Arrow"...</i>

12
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,240
There's always gonna
be another Dante.

13
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,330
There's always gonna be a
logical reason to compromise,

14
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,130
but I'm not doing that anymore.

15
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,760
- Walking way is not the answer.
- Well, I'm not walking away.

16
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,300
I'm gonna call my own shots.

17
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,630
I went to go check
your midterm results online,

18
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,550
and I didn't come across any test results
because you didn't take the exams.

19
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,720
- Why?
- Because I got expelled.

20
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,220
So you found this place
by watching that documentary?

21
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,550
Vigilantes were
the death of Star City,

22
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,100
and they got exactly
what they deserved.

23
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,850
We now have unfettered access

24
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,110
to the Archer program's
entire security interface.

25
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,400
Let's find those bombs.

26
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,150
- Heading home soon?
- Not quite yet.

27
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,530
I'll see you in the morning.

28
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,040
What's it say?

29
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,870
Nothing.

30
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,670
Just some punk kid
pulling a prank.

31
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:53,805

32
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:55,730
You ever get in
trouble with your parents?

33
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,910
Uh, yeah. All the time. Why?

34
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,579
Because William doesn't
need pancakes.

35
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,360
William needs to tell us
why he got expelled

36
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,240
and why he's been lying to us.

37
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,080
- After pancakes or...
- No.

38
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,370
Ok.

39
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,790
- Ready to talk?
- About what?

40
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,330
Why you got expelled.

41
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,140
Come on, will.
You know you can talk

42
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,340
to us about anything. Please.

43
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:24,270
It's not a big deal.
I just got into a fight.

44
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,760
I thought you'd be proud of me.

45
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,430
I went for the nose
just like you told me.

46
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,180
When did you tell him
to go for the nose?

47
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,050
That was over a year ago,

48
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,480
and it was a lesson in
self-defense, thank you.

49
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,350
Buddy, it's not like
you to get into a fight.

50
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,890
Why do you guys even care?

51
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,400
Every time that we spoke,
you're telling me

52
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,950
how much you love your school,

53
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,450
about your new friends
and your classes.

54
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,030
What am I missing here?

55
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,940
Maybe you should have
asked how I felt for once,

56
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,950
but you don't ask other
people for their opinions.

57
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,700
You decide everything on your own

58
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,240
just like you decided to go to prison

59
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,370
rather than take care of your family!

60
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,050
I don't think that's fair, but ok.

61
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,920
William, you got expelled,

62
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,300
and, young man, you need to understand

63
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,800
that in life you have to
accept responsibility

64
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,140
for your actions.

65
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,930
Yeah? I'm over this.

66
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,220
W-William. Hey.

67
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,100
William, we're not done here.

68
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:17,310
That went well.

69
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,150
Damn it! Still no luck figuring out

70
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,980
where Felicity planted those bombs.

71
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,730
Well, I'm pretty sure
hitting that thing harder's

72
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,660
not gonna make it work better.

73
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,690
Makes me feel better, though.

74
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,660
The Archer program's
supposed to see everything,

75
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,620
but what good's that when
there's nothing to see?

76
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,170
About damn time.

77
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,080
Your algorithm kind of sucks.

78
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,290
Ah. Nice to see you, too.
Give it to me.

79
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,920
Archer's not helping us,
and that means

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,800
Blackstar's our only lead
on finding those bombs.

81
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,710
You guys have any luck
tracking her down?

82
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:49,800
Uh-uh. I spent the last few
days searching the entire city,

83
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,550
but she knows how to be a ghost.

84
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,690
Pretty easy to do with
the way the city is now.

85
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,730
Ok. My algorithm isn't the problem.

86
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,190
The Archer program was
designed to monitor The Glades,

87
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:00,020
but Star City is 10 times the size

88
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,730
with half the technological infrastructure.

89
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:02,940
So less eyes covering
a larger area.

90
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,440
Even if that's the case,

91
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,020
that bomb plan was massive.

92
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,790
We should have found something.

93
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,440
Well, not if the bombs
haven't been positioned yet.

94
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,280
I mean,
maybe Felicity stockpiled them

95
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,780
somewhere off the grid,

96
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,380
somewhere no one would
ever think to look.

97
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,380
I think I might know a place.

98
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,330
This is definitely
off the grid.

99
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:27,340
God.
I used to think this place was so cool.

100
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,920
I can't believe
it's still standing.

101
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,510
I can't believe my dad
used to call this home.

102
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:35,560
Yeah. Well, no one's called
this home for quite some time.

103
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,560
Someone's been here.

104
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,480
Unh!

105
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,980
Someone's still here.

106
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,780
I told you this wouldn't end well.

107
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,370
What's that, some A.R.G.U.S. fan mail?

108
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,580
No, not exactly.

109
00:05:56,650 --> 00:06:00,750
Oh. This is some "I know what
you did last summer" creepiness.

110
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,620
- You want me to run a DNA trace?
- No. Already on top of that.

111
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,500
Besides, that's not the reason
why I called you in here.

112
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,710
How's the search for Dante coming?

113
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,840
Good. We were able to backtrace
the number Diaz called.

114
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,270
It belongs to Dante's contact in
Egypt, a guy by the name of Virgil.

115
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,260
If we're able to bring him in,
we'll have Dante.

116
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:19,180
Fantastic! And we would
have you to thank for it.

117
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,730
Excellent work, Curtis.

118
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:23,440
Too bad I might not be
around for my victory lap.

119
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,900
What are we talking about here?

120
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,110
There's no good way to say this,

121
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,730
but I've been offered a job at the
kohler humanitarian institute in D.C.

122
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,450
I would be able to create
tech that would be able

123
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,530
to help people all over the world.

124
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,700
Curtis, I know you're not happy
with the Ghost Initiative,

125
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,740
but I was hoping that
we could get past that.

126
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,410
Besides, the work you're
doing right here at A.R.G.U.S.

127
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,120
Is already helping people
all over the world.

128
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,960
I know you believe that, John.

129
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,470
I'm just not sure that I do.

130
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:58,760
The key is to maintain eye contact.

131
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,650
Your assailant's gonna
focus on your weakness.

132
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,480
In this case, it's that injury.

133
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,150
So you draw them in,

134
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,730
and as soon as
they're close enough, strike.

135
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:11,650
Yeah! That's very good.
Eh, you're a natural.

136
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,570
Thanks for teaching me, aunt Dinah.

137
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:16,160
It's so cool learning how to
kick ass from the Black Canary.

138
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,160
Keep kicking the crap
out of that shield,

139
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:22,340
and captain Drake's gonna
have to deputize you, too.

140
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,790
How about you keep practicing
your kicks in your room?

141
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,300
- Ok.
- Good job.

142
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,680
I saw the way you looked

143
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,260
when Zoe mentioned
the Black Canary.

144
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,470
You still adjusting to being outed?

145
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,350
Well, it was one thing when all
the people in our inner circle

146
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,970
knew about my secret identity,

147
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,020
but now everybody knows,

148
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,520
the cops at SCPD, everybody.

149
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:51,190
I don't know. Maybe I'm just worried
people are gonna treat me differently

150
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,980
now that the secret's out.

151
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:54,700
Yeah. Well, maybe it's a good
idea that me and the team

152
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,610
are gonna be hanging out
at the SCPD for now

153
00:07:57,690 --> 00:07:59,320
in case I got to
crack some heads.

154
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,820
Oh. Thanks.

155
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,620
Hey. Ever since you
became captain,

156
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:06,540
you've been busting your ass to
earn their trust and respect,

157
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,500
so you keep doing
what you're doing

158
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,970
and don't sweat the haters
because they're gonna hate

159
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:14,640
like... whoever left me this.

160
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,470
- When did you get this?
- Last night.

161
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,220
Figured it was some
punk-ass pranking me

162
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:23,310
for working with you and the SCPD.

163
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,470
- Oh, damn.
- What, did you get one, too?

164
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:28,020
And so did Laurel. We've been
trying to track down who did it.

165
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,850
We thought maybe it was about
a case we worked together,

166
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,410
but if you're getting them, too...

167
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,160
Who knows who his
next target is?

168
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,210
Ohh!

169
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,920
Get back!

170
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,930
What the hell?
I can't move.

171
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,680
Oh. Stop! Please
just stop.

172
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,810
I'll give you anything you want.

173
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,600
Why are you doing this?

174
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:09,740
Ugh!

175
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,950
Wow! This is a lot of blood.

176
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,200
I thought kullens was
in jail for helping Diaz.

177
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:23,030
Yeah. Well, apparently,
he had a very good lawyer

178
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,210
because he got out a month ago.

179
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:27,210
Any chance this connects
with the two body drops

180
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:30,170
we were looking at last week?

181
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,220
Kullens did have his throat
slit, same as the other two.

182
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,040
I mean, the only difference
is that kullens

183
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,010
was the only victim to leave
behind one of these notes.

184
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,510
Look familiar?

185
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,130
I spoke to the families
of the other victims,

186
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,730
and they did get notes, as well.

187
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,640
- They just didn't turn them in.
- Right.

188
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,850
This is turning out to be one
hell of a first day on the job.

189
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,980
Yeah. Look at us,
working together again,

190
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,690
being targeted by
a homicidal maniac.

191
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,240
Feels like a Monday.

192
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:52,740
What about Laurel?

193
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,820
You said that she got a note, too.

194
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,860
She did, but she's fine.
She's at a conference in D.C. all week.

195
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:59,900
Ok. So wait.
You, me, Laurel, Rene all got notes.

196
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,990
- Curtis and Oliver didn't.
- Oh, don't worry about me.

197
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:04,170
I'm definitely not feeling fomo over it.

198
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,250
Well, we already know this killer's
not only targeting people on the team.

199
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,830
Kullens was against vigilantes,

200
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,370
and we didn't even know
the other two victims.

201
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:11,920
There has to be a connection.

202
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,500
We just... Be patient,
and we'll find it.

203
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,210
Maybe this will help.

204
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:16,680
Kullens' autopsy report.

205
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,180
Tox screen is clear.
No defensive wounds.

206
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,050
So he didn't fight back.

207
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,060
This M.O. feels very familiar.

208
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,850
When I was undercover
in Central City,

209
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,650
the guys in homicide were
chasing after a serial killer

210
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,560
with a very similar pattern...

211
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,480
Throat slash and victims
who didn't fight back.

212
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,950
I'm gonna give
captain Singh a call.

213
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:44,620
Wakey, wakey, money bags.

214
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,790
Unh!

215
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:57,090
Touch me, I'll bite your hand off.

216
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,210
Almost makes me forget
that you're nothing

217
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,050
but a pampered girl from The Glades

218
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:03,130
playing vigilante dress-up.

219
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,800
What do you want?

220
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,220
The access codes to Archer.

221
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,110
Go to hell.

222
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:10,600
Well, let's try this another way.

223
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,890
Wait! Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

224
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,690
The access codes now.

225
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,600
Keep your mouth shut, William.

226
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,320
So that's your name.

227
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,320
All right, William.
What the hell are you even doing here?

228
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,660
Funny. I was just about
to ask you the same thing.

229
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,570
Ooh. Is that a backbone I'm seeing?

230
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:27,240
Even if we give you the codes,
you're just gonna kill us

231
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,240
just like you killed Felicity and just like
you're gonna kill the rest of the city,

232
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,250
so what is the point in talking?

233
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:35,510
Someone is trying to blow up the
city, but it's not me,

234
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,180
and I sure as hell didn't kill Felicity.

235
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:40,300
Then who did?

236
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:43,010
About what you said,

237
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,930
about wanting to do
something different.

238
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,840
Ok. Suddenly, I'm getting nervous
about where this is going.

239
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,800
No need.

240
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,430
Just talked with Lyla,
and we both agree

241
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:56,100
that, Curtis, we cannot afford
to lose a talent like yours,

242
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:59,230
so A.R.G.U.S. wants to make you

243
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:02,030
the head of its science
and technology division.

244
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:04,110
You want me in charge
of the entire division?

245
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:06,370
The entire division.
You'll be shaping the future

246
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,490
of A.R.G.U.S., Curtis,

247
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,780
and you can make all the
decisions just like you wanted.

248
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,210
- I don't know what to say.
- Say you'll do it, man.

249
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:15,160
Just stay here in Star City.

250
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,710
You can keep working
with the team.

251
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,460
I think it's the best of both worlds.

252
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:21,640
Think about it.

253
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,730
Captain Singh, thank you
for getting back to me.

254
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:32,680
I'd have done it sooner,
but some new metahuman freak

255
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,980
sent a bunch of Central
City's finest to the hospital

256
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,270
before the Flash and his
team were able to stop them,

257
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:40,480
not that there's anything
wrong with metahumans.

258
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,520
No disrespect intended, Dinah.

259
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,360
Well, none taken. Heh.

260
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,240
And here I was just starting
to feel like I had a handle

261
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,790
on this whole captain thing.

262
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,580
Do you remember when
blockbuster and his gang

263
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,200
tried to expand their operations

264
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,200
from bludhaven to Central City?

265
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:56,210
And almost started a turf war
with all the major crime families?

266
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,580
- Yeah.
- But it didn't,

267
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,590
all because one undercover cop

268
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,590
had the balls and the brains
to infiltrate their ranks

269
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,420
and prevent
a citywide bloodbath.

270
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:04,880
If anyone knows how to win

271
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,090
hearts and minds, Dinah, it's you.

272
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,930
You just have to have faith in yourself.

273
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,440
I certainly do.

274
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,230
So about that case file.

275
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:22,060
Your father is gonna make
his famous chili tonight.

276
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,530
Does he really think making
dinner is gonna solve everything?

277
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,570
I mean, it's his chili
we're talking about.

278
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,700
I'm pretty sure it could solve world peace.

279
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,830
- Let me see that.
- It's impossible.

280
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,290
Actually, solving a Rubik's Cube is a lot

281
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,250
like running an algorithm.

282
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:40,300
In fact, my favorite
pattern is a cube

283
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,720
within a cube.

284
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:47,710
- That's pretty cool.
- Yeah. Thanks.

285
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:51,260
The Green Arrow has
entered through the front door.

286
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:53,680
Heh heh heh.

287
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,680
- The Green Arrow?
- You know, I thought I'd give

288
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,890
the security system
a little personality.

289
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,100
Hey, buddy.

290
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,520
Help me unpack these bags.

291
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,610
I'm good.

292
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,730
Ok. Give you two
a moment alone.

293
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:08,660
Give me those.
Thank you.

294
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,280
William, I understand why
you were mad at me before.

295
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,960
You have every right
to be mad at me, ok?

296
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,510
You're a tough kid.

297
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:30,470
And I forget sometimes
that you are just a kid...

298
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:36,010
That's lived in 4 different
cities over the past 2 years.

299
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,640
That's tough.
One of the many reasons

300
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,600
why Felicity and I think that
you should come back here

301
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,530
and live with us.

302
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,910
Warning, warning.
Unidentified person at the front door.

303
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:53,080
Did you...

304
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,300
Mr. and Mrs. Clayton?

305
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,300
What are you doing here?

306
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,230
Our grandson called us.

307
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:21,381
Ok. I apologize.
I understand and appreciate

308
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,420
why after everything
that's happened

309
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,260
you two might be worried,

310
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,880
but we can assure you
that... that going forward

311
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,930
things will be better
and more stable, ok?

312
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,590
- They will be...
- Right.

313
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,800
Because we're taking
him with us.

314
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,560
We're filing a suit
for guardianship.

315
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,980
No. You can't do that.

316
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:46,030
William, we need to speak
with your grandparents alone.

317
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:54,070
Oliver, it's an open-and-shut case.

318
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:55,620
You're a convicted felon.

319
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,780
You were absent for
most of his life,

320
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,530
and then once you showed up...
heh...

321
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:04,790
He's kidnapped,
he's sent into hiding from a mob boss.

322
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,170
I'm his father, frank.

323
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,750
By blood maybe,

324
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:11,380
but you are not fit
to be William's guardian,

325
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,260
either of you.

326
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,220
We should have done
this a long time ago.

327
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,930
Yes, dear.

328
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,480
It's what Samantha would
have wanted for him.

329
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,150
William is my son.
Felicity treats

330
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,600
and cares for him like a son,

331
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:25,810
and nobody...

332
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,200
Is gonna take him away from us.

333
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,660
No one.

334
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,450
I hate tranqs.

335
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,000
Where are the others?

336
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,740
Hey, you!
Where are our friends?

337
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,120
They're with Blackstar.

338
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,010
Hey. She's got
questions to ask.

339
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,500
What about us?

340
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:52,750
I already know everything
I need to about you,

341
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:56,630
and you guys should
have stayed out of this.

342
00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:00,690
Wait. I recognize you.

343
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:04,360
You know him?

344
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:08,980
And so do you.
You're Connor hawke,

345
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,530
John Diggle's son.

346
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:15,330
Thank you, Dinah.

347
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,540
Call me if you
need anything, ok?

348
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,830
All right.

349
00:17:23,570 --> 00:17:25,790
Can I speak with you
for a moment?

350
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:29,040
Why? Sounds like you got
to go save the city again.

351
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:33,630
William, get over here
and sit down.

352
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,510
What?

353
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,400
Your grandparents are trying
to take you away from me.

354
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:47,140
There is no chance
that that's gonna happen,

355
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:51,650
but I cannot... I cannot
have you phoning for backup

356
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,310
every time that you're
mad at me.

357
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:55,020
It's the only thing
that got you to listen!

358
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,580
You think I'm not listening?

359
00:17:56,650 --> 00:17:59,700
I have heard and felt

360
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:02,580
every single terrible thing that you've
said to me since you've been back!

361
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,410
Come on. I'm...
I'm trying my best.

362
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,250
That's the problem because
whenever you're around,

363
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,870
things always get worse!

364
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:12,760
You want to give me
a normal life?

365
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,710
Yes! That's all I've ever tried to do!

366
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,760
That's why I...
That why I've asked you

367
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:20,050
to come back here and live
with Felicity and I.

368
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:22,480
That isn't a normal life!
I want to go live with my grandparents!

369
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,730
Eight murders over the
course of 2 months.

370
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,780
And this is definitely the
same guy we're dealing with?

371
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,730
Yeah. Analysis of the wound
confirms the same angle of entry

372
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:38,190
in all the murders here
and in Central City.

373
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:42,790
The question is why pack up
and bring the fun here?

374
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,370
Yeah. That really is the missing
piece of the puzzle, isn't it?

375
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:46,960
Doesn't seem to be

376
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,700
any obvious connection
between the victims.

377
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,800
Actually, maybe there is.

378
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:54,420
They all had elevated levels
of magnesium in their blood.

379
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,800
But their tox screens
came back clear.

380
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,050
Well, that's because increased
magnesium alone isn't a red flag,

381
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,480
but if you combine that with
decreased levels of red blood cells,

382
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:05,220
then you have a drug
called mivacurium.

383
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,930
It's a neuromuscular
blocking agent.

384
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:10,640
Captain Singh said it looked like
the victims had been immobilized.

385
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,350
It's because they
had been drugged.

386
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,230
Mivacurium is extremely rare.

387
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,310
In fact, there's only been
one shipment in the past month

388
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,990
to Star City to a condemned
house in The Glades

389
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:21,650
addressed to a John Doe.

390
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,330
- Hey, don't, Curtis.
- Why not?

391
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,420
What if someone spots
that thing flying around?

392
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:37,330
Might as well have
a freaking neon sign

393
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,460
that says, "hey, murderer.
We're here."

394
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,840
You were saying, Rene?

395
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,680
Curtis, Rene, you take upstairs.

396
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:50,020
Me and Dinah will
secure down here.

397
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:54,640
Split up? What? Have you guys
never seen a horror movie before?

398
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,860
Wait, Rene!

399
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,520
Rene.

400
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,940
Don't sneak up on me like that!

401
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,200
Sorry. What was that?

402
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,260
Our psycho was at Slabside?

403
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,890
Hyah!

404
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:06,900
Unh!

405
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,120
You should have
listened to me, huh?

406
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,290
- Dinah.
- Dinah, where are you?

407
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:27,290
Dinah, I need you to copy.
Can you hear me?

408
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:29,140
Dinah, where are you?

409
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,680
- Oh!
- Oh, my god.

410
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:37,187
Dinah. Have to stop the bleeding.

411
00:24:37,188 --> 00:24:38,050
We have to call
an ambulance.

412
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,060
They won't get here in time.

413
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,220
You're gonna be fine. D!

414
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,995
It's too deep.
There's nothing I can do.

415
00:24:43,996 --> 00:24:46,240
- What?!
- Maybe there's something I can do.

416
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,100
I've been working
on a new prototype...

417
00:24:47,101 --> 00:24:49,630
Mid-infrared lasers that might
be able to cauterize the wound.

418
00:24:49,631 --> 00:24:52,190
- Might or will?
- I don't know,

419
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,900
but the only way to bond the
cut is by burning it first.

420
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,250
- I've never tested it, though!
- Do it! Do it!

421
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,490
Ok.

422
00:24:57,570 --> 00:25:00,540
- Tell me when.
- When.

423
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:06,010
Ok. Done.

424
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,260
There's a pulse.

425
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,930
You did it.

426
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,640
Be strong, Dinah.

427
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:22,100
I take it by the way that
you're treating the chili

428
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,890
that your talk
didn't go so well.

429
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:25,520
He wants to go live
with his grandparents.

430
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,440
- And you think that's...
- I think it's ridiculous

431
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:29,610
because we're his family and
we are what's best for him!

432
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,480
Sorry.

433
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,190
Well, we've all grown
and changed a lot

434
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:35,790
since you got out of Slabside,

435
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,950
and I've been thinking
that maybe you and I

436
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,460
need to think more about
what William needs.

437
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:44,540
You need to tell me...

438
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:48,540
If you honestly believe that he
would be better off away from us.

439
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,960
I think that now
that you're working

440
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:54,970
with the SCPD
and Team Arrow again

441
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:59,890
that we don't exactly provide
a life of normalcy and...

442
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,810
I just want to be a better father
for him than my father was for me.

443
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:05,360
You already are by giving him
the life that he deserves...

444
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:09,560
Even if it breaks our hearts.

445
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,610
If you didn't kill
Felicity, then who did?

446
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:21,370
No one. Felicity's
still alive.

447
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,170
How do you know that?

448
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,160
I just do.

449
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:27,660
It's why I need Archer...
To find Felicity.

450
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,460
Don't listen to her.
She's a liar.

451
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:31,670
She'll say anything to...

452
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,040
You didn't need to do that.

453
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,470
No, but I enjoyed it.

454
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,690
Now... how about
those codes?

455
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,430
Only after you tell me why
you're looking for Felicity.

456
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:45,270
Let's just say
we owe each other.

457
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:49,190
What I don't get is you.

458
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,650
You're no hero wannabe
like the rest of them.

459
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,530
You're obviously well off,

460
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:57,820
enough to not slum
around Star City.

461
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,610
So what are you
getting out of this?

462
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:04,870
Honestly...
I don't know.

463
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:07,000
Closure maybe, to ask Felicity

464
00:27:07,070 --> 00:27:08,710
why she disappeared from my life

465
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,120
only to contact me now
out of the blue.

466
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,960
What, did you guys
date or something?

467
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,100
God, no. I'm gay,
and she's my mom.

468
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,350
Stepmom.

469
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,050
Oliver Queen is your father?

470
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:24,400
Did you get anything
out of them?

471
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,190
You're supposed to be
watching the others.

472
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,900
Unh! Agh!

473
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,740
Hyaaah!

474
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:42,870
Hyaaah!

475
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,210
- Brace yourself.
- What?

476
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:55,640
Aah!

477
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,950
Roy!

478
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,690
- Ugh!
- Drop the bow.

479
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:21,780
You first.

480
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:29,950
Called the ambulance.
They're on their way.

481
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,660
They'll be here any minute.

482
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,290
- Shh, shh, shh.
- D., D., relax.

483
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,830
Help's on the way.
You don't have to talk.

484
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:38,380
Oliver. Ohh. Oliver.

485
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,640
Oliver.

486
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,440
What the hell?

487
00:28:55,510 --> 00:28:58,270
Slabside. We found a uniform
upstairs in the closet.

488
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,990
This guy must have been
in prison with Oliver.

489
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:01,990
So all of this, the
notes, the murders...

490
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,240
It's about Oliver.

491
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,740
Mmm. Sure beats our suppers
in hope Springs, hey, William?

492
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,290
Except when we ate there,

493
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,290
I could actually see my food.

494
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,170
Yeah. I'm sure they're working on
getting the power back on soon.

495
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,080
This storm is crazy.

496
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,510
I thought my chili
was your favorite, bud.

497
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,460
- It's too spicy.
- What are you talking about?

498
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,760
It's perfect.
It's absolutely delicious.

499
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:27,140
In fact, I will have seconds if you
could pass me some more, please.

500
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:29,010
I can't.

501
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,390
Felicity...

502
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,930
I can't really move.

503
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:34,520
I can't either.

504
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:36,360
What's that sound?

505
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,150
Dad, what's going on?

506
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,530
Don't worry, Oliver.
It's me.

507
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,800
I'm just really happy
to see you guys again.

508
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,980
It's so nice to meet you, William.

509
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:17,540
I'm Stanley Dover.
I'm your dad's best friend.

510
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,740
Stanley, don't hurt my son.

511
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:23,150
Hurt him?
I don't want to hurt any of you.

512
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:26,910
I... I just want to talk.

513
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,870
That's why I gave you
the medicine...

514
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:31,750
So you would listen to me.

515
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,710
What kind of medicine?

516
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:37,720
Don't worry.
Its effects are temporary.

517
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:41,600
I used to take this stuff all
the time when I was a kid.

518
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:44,590
My dad was a doctor.

519
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,100
Said you want to talk, Stanley.

520
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,890
What do you want to talk about?

521
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,390
I just have to warn you

522
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:56,610
because those people,
they don't understand you like I do.

523
00:30:56,690 --> 00:30:58,450
Which people?

524
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,950
The people that call
themselves your friends.

525
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,450
I've been sending them warnings,

526
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:03,940
but they haven't listened.

527
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:05,940
Warnings?

528
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,240
What kind of warnings?
Like, notes?

529
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,120
Yeah.

530
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,870
You're the Star City slayer.

531
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:17,550
Err! Don't call me that.

532
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:20,960
I'm... I'm sorry.
Oliver, I'm sorry.

533
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:25,380
I just really hate that name.

534
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:30,220
Look. No tricks this time, ok?

535
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:34,810
I just really need you to listen to me.

536
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:40,770
Ok. All right, Stanley,

537
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:42,910
but this is between us...

538
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:47,570
So I need you to let
my wife and son go.

539
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:51,820
I can't because there's people
out there that want to hurt you,

540
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:54,240
who want to hurt all of you.

541
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,340
If you knew the things that
I had to do to protect you.

542
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:02,180
But I know that you would
do the same thing for me.

543
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:06,760
I... I like that you're
working with the police.

544
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,520
Not everybody does.

545
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,840
There's people out there
that are saying

546
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:12,550
bad things about you.

547
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,180
They want to hurt you.

548
00:32:14,190 --> 00:32:16,860
Like that councilman
that worked with Diaz.

549
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,030
Some people don't
deserve to live.

550
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:26,530
Come on, Stanley.

551
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:28,610
My teammates
would never hurt me.

552
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:30,950
But they're still bad for you,

553
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,710
worse even because they
don't understand you,

554
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:36,030
they don't understand
you like I do,

555
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:38,710
and I only had time
to correct one of them.

556
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,160
"Correct" them?

557
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,040
The police captain.

558
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,750
The Black Canary.

559
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,710
What did you do to her?

560
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:49,210
It doesn't matter

561
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,890
because we're together now,

562
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:53,560
and we can go somewhere new
and be a new team!

563
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,810
But I don't know about her

564
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,640
because I don't think
that she's been listening.

565
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,020
Hey, Stanley!

566
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,730
She's... she's listening.

567
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,770
Just a little scared, all right?

568
00:33:07,850 --> 00:33:10,650
Sure. I used to be scared

569
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:13,490
when my dad gave me medicine.

570
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:17,080
He gave me medicine
whenever I was bad

571
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,580
or I didn't listen,

572
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:22,090
and so when I couldn't move

573
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:25,090
and when I had to listen,

574
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,220
then he would correct me.

575
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,710
Your dad used to hurt you?

576
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:34,720
He was just doing what he
thought was right for me.

577
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,510
My mother thought so, too.

578
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:41,390
My older brother,
he tried to protect me,

579
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:45,020
tried to take
my punishments for me,

580
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,820
but it only made it worse.

581
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,790
I couldn't take it anymore,

582
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:04,410
and I gave my parents
some medicine.

583
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:06,130
I corrected them.

584
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:14,420
Everybody's got to get back
at their parents sometimes,

585
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,970
right, William?

586
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,480
Right, buddy?

587
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,220
Stanley, you said your brother.

588
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,770
Where's your brother now?

589
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,650
When he found out
what I did for him,

590
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,160
he got upset.

591
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,440
I don't know why.

592
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:35,330
He wanted to send me
to Arkham Asylum,

593
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:38,950
so I had to give him
some medicine, too.

594
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:41,490
I needed to correct him.

595
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:43,540
You killed your own brother?

596
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:47,080
I didn't have a choice.

597
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,750
If he just listened to me,

598
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:52,170
then I wouldn't have
had to do it,

599
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,220
and none of this
would have happened...

600
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,690
But I'm starting to think
that you're not listening

601
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,730
to me either, Oliver.

602
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,900
I can tell!

603
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:07,700
And you should have... you
should have apologized to me

604
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:09,860
for being mean to me
at Slabside,

605
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:12,820
but you haven't,
so I'm starting to think

606
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:14,860
that you're just like
everybody else

607
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:18,320
and you don't deserve
my... my protection.

608
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,750
I'm sorry that you feel
that way, Stanley.

609
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:29,760
You're exactly
like your father, Stanley.

610
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,890
You're wrong.
I'm nothing like him.

611
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:38,720
You're right, you're right.

612
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:41,720
You're worse.

613
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:44,390
You're the Star City slayer.

614
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,070
I told you I hate that name!

615
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:49,100
William.

616
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:50,570
Agh!

617
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,650
Are you all right?

618
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:01,030
We are now.

619
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,330
Hey. Dinah's
in surgery now.

620
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,070
Doctors say she'll be fine,

621
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,415
although they're not too
sure about her voice yet.

622
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,410
Dover's been picked up by SCPD.

623
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,280
They're transferring him
back to Slabside tomorrow.

624
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,740
How many times
has he done this?

625
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,580
At least 3 that we know of.

626
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:20,580
It always involves some
older brother figure,

627
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,250
someone he admires.

628
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,010
Stanley starts off
by killing those he thinks

629
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,460
are bad for them
and not just enemies

630
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:28,000
but friends, as well.

631
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,800
Tries to impress them,
tries to endear himself,

632
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,300
and when that doesn't work,
they become his next target.

633
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:35,840
You guys ok, though?

634
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,680
So far, so good.
If there's any trace

635
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:39,640
of the drugs left in our
system, the doctors will find it

636
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,640
in the gallons of blood
they just siphoned from us.

637
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,950
I'm gonna go check on William
and get him discharged.

638
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:50,410
This is A.R.G.U.S.
we have to go.

639
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:52,330
Actually, John, uh...

640
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:57,160
You are taking
the position in D.C.

641
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:59,620
Look. I know that A.R.G.U.S.
does a lot of good,

642
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:02,830
but I'll never agree with
them on how they do it.

643
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:05,790
You have to do
what's right for you,

644
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:08,840
but I am gonna miss you, Curtis.

645
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,220
I'm gonna miss you, too.

646
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:20,230
Sorry I didn't tell you.
Just with everything going on...

647
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:22,520
Eh, Rene already gave you up.

648
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,560
I was kind hoping
more for "boo-hoo.

649
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,060
"I'll miss you so much.

650
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,690
You're my other half
I'll never replace."

651
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,070
Yeah, but I'm really
happy that you're

652
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,690
finally doing what you want.

653
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:34,530
I think it's time
you do the same.

654
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,410
- Yeah.
- I talked to my lawyer.

655
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:38,070
They're gonna draw up
some legal documents.

656
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:42,200
I'm signing over sole
ownership of helix to you.

657
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,830
You don't have to do that.

658
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:45,460
I want to.

659
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:47,250
Helix was your idea,

660
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,500
and I love working with you,

661
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,500
but it feels like
you're struggling

662
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,670
to find your purpose, too.

663
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,020
Yeah.

664
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:56,970
Maybe this is it.

665
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:03,180
Maybe this is how Felicity
Smoak will change the world.

666
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:05,930
Well, you are right.

667
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:08,060
I am really gonna miss you.

668
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:16,950
Hey.

669
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,620
Are we going home?

670
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:23,080
Well, that depends.

671
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:25,080
Do you want to go home?

672
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,050
What do you mean?

673
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:30,080
I mean you were right

674
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,180
that I never asked you
what you wanted.

675
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,180
So I'm asking now.

676
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:39,720
Would you like to come home

677
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:42,930
and live with us?

678
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:47,320
Or do you want to go and
live with your grandparents?

679
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,160
I just want a normal life.

680
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:54,240
I want that for you, too.

681
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:58,500
I thought I could...

682
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:01,040
Provide that for you...

683
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:05,240
Especially since, um, you know,

684
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,050
I've been unmasked.

685
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:13,800
After what happened
tonight, I see that, um...

686
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:21,760
Normal may never be
a real possibility.

687
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,140
I don't want you to stop
being a hero.

688
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:26,520
I know the city needs you.

689
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:31,140
I just think for at least now,

690
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,810
it might be better for me
to be in Central City.

691
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:35,700
Ok.

692
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:39,370
Then that's what we'll do.

693
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:45,950
It gets really cold there
in the winter,

694
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,620
so I'm gonna send you,
like, 3 coats

695
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,330
and mitts and a hat.

696
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:51,660
You're definitely
gonna need a hat.

697
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:53,720
Ohh.

698
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,540
I'll miss you so much.

699
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:57,180
I'm gonna miss you, too.

700
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:08,010
Listen here, young man.

701
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:11,570
Wherever you are,
I'm always gonna be your dad.

702
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:15,230
So we'll talk
all the time... ahem...

703
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,070
And I promise to come and visit

704
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,740
whenever it's cool with you

705
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:21,360
and with your grandparents.

706
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:24,820
You just have to
promise that you...

707
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:27,250
You will call me...

708
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:30,910
If you need anything,
anything, you will call me, ok?

709
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:32,830
- I will.
- You have a home

710
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:37,920
with the two of us
in Star City forever.

711
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:39,170
I love you, William.

712
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,600
I love you, too, dad.

713
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:52,110
Hi. Dr. Schwartz,
is everything ok?

714
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,060
Oh, good. I thought it was
gonna be one of those calls

715
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:56,610
where you say,
"everything spread to the liver," and...

716
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:02,990
And what?

717
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,370
You can't win this.

718
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,200
Drop the damn knife.

719
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,380
Come on! Don't give me a
reason to pull this trigger.

720
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:20,960
You're not gonna shoot me.

721
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,220
You sure about that?

722
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:26,260
Yeah...

723
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:29,720
Because my name is Mia Smoak.

724
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,890
I'm Felicity's daughter

725
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:33,650
and your sister.

726
