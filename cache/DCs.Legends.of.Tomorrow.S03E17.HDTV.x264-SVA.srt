00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,453
Previously on Legends of Tomorrow...

2
00:00:01,454 --> 00:00:03,638
Sara can never find out
the truth about Ava.

3
00:00:03,639 --> 00:00:04,905
- I'm a...
- You're a clone.

4
00:00:04,906 --> 00:00:05,924
Future clone thing?

5
00:00:05,925 --> 00:00:09,291
The first totem bearers
imprisoned a great evil.

6
00:00:09,292 --> 00:00:11,477
And time is his cage.

7
00:00:11,478 --> 00:00:14,312
If you cannot defeat me in this vessel,

8
00:00:14,313 --> 00:00:17,833
how will you stop me once
I've assumed my true form?

9
00:00:17,834 --> 00:00:20,354
Our family's destruction looms in 1992.

10
00:00:20,355 --> 00:00:21,861
You promised you'd save us.

11
00:00:25,792 --> 00:00:26,804
Kuasa.

12
00:00:26,805 --> 00:00:29,665
Gideon, set a course. I
have to save my family.

13
00:00:32,155 --> 00:00:35,057
Code 1-3-1! All hands on the bridge!

14
00:00:35,058 --> 00:00:36,625
- What's going on?
- Yeah.

15
00:00:36,626 --> 00:00:38,293
I gotta get back to "Lord of the Rings."

16
00:00:38,294 --> 00:00:39,996
You read?

17
00:00:39,997 --> 00:00:41,931
Code 1-3-1.

18
00:00:41,932 --> 00:00:43,665
Come on, guys, I wrote
a whole a whole memo.

19
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:45,000
Yeah, nobody read it.

20
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:46,735
- I did.
- Thank you, Ray.

21
00:00:46,736 --> 00:00:49,271
- Pancakes for breakfast.
- No, 1-3-1 is not... is it?

22
00:00:49,272 --> 00:00:51,140
Yeah. Does that mean no pancakes?

23
00:00:51,141 --> 00:00:53,642
Anyway, I wrote a song to help
us remember all the codes.

24
00:00:53,643 --> 00:00:55,510
It goes like this. From the top!

25
00:00:55,511 --> 00:00:57,779
 If the code is 1-1-1 

26
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:00,416
 Mallus escaped the time dungeon 

27
00:01:00,417 --> 00:01:02,351
 If the code is 1-1-2... 

28
00:01:02,352 --> 00:01:03,685
All right, Nate, just tell us.

29
00:01:03,686 --> 00:01:05,521
Someone stole the jumpship.

30
00:01:07,457 --> 00:01:09,157
Where's Amaya?

31
00:01:09,358 --> 00:01:11,928
According to the jumpship logs,

32
00:01:11,929 --> 00:01:13,996
Zambesi, 1992.

33
00:01:13,997 --> 00:01:16,866
Right before the warlords
destroyed her village.

34
00:01:16,867 --> 00:01:18,867
And she dies.

35
00:01:18,868 --> 00:01:20,938
The old her, that is.

36
00:01:23,253 --> 00:01:25,040
The temporal zone
is getting real choppy.

37
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:26,642
Yeah, the timeline was
crumbling even before Amaya

38
00:01:26,643 --> 00:01:28,010
decided to change history.

39
00:01:28,011 --> 00:01:29,412
If that happens, the Darhks will be able

40
00:01:29,413 --> 00:01:30,946
to free their demon.

41
00:01:30,947 --> 00:01:33,715
Oh, well, I'd better
get back to my movie.

42
00:01:33,716 --> 00:01:35,218
And we'd better stop Amaya

43
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:36,587
before she does something reckless.

44
00:01:36,588 --> 00:01:39,488
- Gideon, plot a course for...
- Pardon me, Captain Lance.

45
00:01:39,489 --> 00:01:42,324
But we are receiving an
urgent call from Mr. Hunter.

46
00:01:42,325 --> 00:01:44,494
- You good?
- Gideon, put him on.

47
00:01:45,562 --> 00:01:47,462
The Bureau needs backup.

48
00:01:47,463 --> 00:01:49,066
Grodd's going after Barry.

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,368
Well, that explains the time turbulence.

50
00:01:52,369 --> 00:01:54,203
The Flash is always in trouble.

51
00:01:54,204 --> 00:01:56,740
- It's kind of his thing.
- Not that particular Barry.

60
00:02:29,072 --> 00:02:30,639
All right, people, we're dealing with

61
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,609
two anachronisms now,
Zambesi and young Obama.

62
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:34,910
Wally, Nate, I want you guys

63
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:36,345
to go talk some sense into Amaya.

64
00:02:36,346 --> 00:02:37,613
You mean, convince her
to stand down while

65
00:02:37,614 --> 00:02:39,448
her village and family is torn apart?

66
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:42,918
What if I use my temporal
simulator to find some loophole

67
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:45,656
that Amaya can use to help save Zambesi?

68
00:02:47,391 --> 00:02:48,791
All right, do it.

69
00:02:48,792 --> 00:02:51,327
The rest of us, we're on Obamacare.

70
00:02:55,986 --> 00:02:58,768
You will not escape.

71
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:00,335
Grodd will complete his mission.

72
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:06,275
Time to make America Grodd again.

73
00:03:06,276 --> 00:03:07,643
Clearly, you have some grievances.

74
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:11,447
But perhaps we can look
for a common ground.

75
00:03:15,184 --> 00:03:16,219
Or not.

76
00:03:17,787 --> 00:03:20,590
Finally, the cage is breaking.

77
00:03:23,192 --> 00:03:26,629
I can feel his arrival.

78
00:03:28,765 --> 00:03:29,933
Oh, goodie.

79
00:03:48,184 --> 00:03:50,286
Yes, resist.

80
00:03:50,287 --> 00:03:53,222
You will only prolong your suffering.

81
00:04:00,196 --> 00:04:02,699
Should have wasted your
hairy ass in 'Nam.

82
00:04:07,236 --> 00:04:08,671
Run, Barry, run!

83
00:04:11,774 --> 00:04:15,344
A hairless ape who fights with fire.

84
00:04:15,345 --> 00:04:17,247
How primitive.

85
00:04:31,094 --> 00:04:33,462
Nora. Nora, honey.

86
00:04:33,463 --> 00:04:36,399
- You okay?
- We were so close.

87
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,701
My master was escaping his bonds.

88
00:04:38,702 --> 00:04:39,563
What happened?

89
00:04:39,564 --> 00:04:41,470
Grodd's mission must have failed.

90
00:04:41,471 --> 00:04:42,938
Maybe that could be a good thing.

91
00:04:42,939 --> 00:04:44,406
It gives you and me
time to figure out what

92
00:04:44,407 --> 00:04:46,075
the big guy's arrival really means.

93
00:04:47,576 --> 00:04:50,178
It means the end of history.

94
00:04:50,179 --> 00:04:52,514
A chance for us to live as gods.

95
00:04:52,515 --> 00:04:55,250
As gods?

96
00:04:55,251 --> 00:04:57,152
Man, that sounds fantastic and all.

97
00:04:57,153 --> 00:04:58,554
But what I just saw, it seems like

98
00:04:58,555 --> 00:05:00,856
there won't be a "you" anymore.

99
00:05:00,857 --> 00:05:03,125
It'll just be him.

100
00:05:03,126 --> 00:05:07,262
That's what we always wanted.

101
00:05:07,263 --> 00:05:10,499
Isn't it?

102
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,103
Totally. 100%.

103
00:05:14,104 --> 00:05:15,804
You know, I'm just gonna
check on our grumpy gorilla

104
00:05:15,805 --> 00:05:17,506
and see how he screwed this thing up.

105
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:23,712
I'll see you later.

106
00:05:23,713 --> 00:05:27,049
No, you won't.

107
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,785
Of course.

108
00:05:29,786 --> 00:05:31,520
'Cause once I complete Grodd's mission,

109
00:05:31,521 --> 00:05:35,991
you will be gone.

110
00:05:35,992 --> 00:05:39,027
What I meant to say was,

111
00:05:39,028 --> 00:05:40,763
I'll see Mallus later.

112
00:05:49,005 --> 00:05:51,041
Goodbye, Nora doll.

113
00:06:03,286 --> 00:06:06,021
Grodd will destroy you. You're dead!

114
00:06:06,022 --> 00:06:08,424
Nice work. Let's get
him back to the ship.

115
00:06:08,425 --> 00:06:10,659
Yeah. Come on, teeny-tiny Grodd.

116
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,460
I think we still have
some chew toys left over

117
00:06:12,461 --> 00:06:13,929
from the saber-toothed tiger.

118
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:14,996
Nice to meet you.

119
00:06:14,997 --> 00:06:17,808
I'm a PhD student doing history
research, Andy Watkins.

00:06:22,405 --> 00:06:24,007
talent scout for the New York Knicks.

123
00:06:26,042 --> 00:06:27,310
What are you doing here?

124
00:06:28,611 --> 00:06:30,713
What are you doing here?

125
00:06:30,714 --> 00:06:32,514
Preventing the genocide
of my people tomorrow.

126
00:06:32,515 --> 00:06:34,683
We know. We're here to stop you.

127
00:06:34,684 --> 00:06:36,385
Peacefully.

128
00:06:36,386 --> 00:06:39,355
Look, Amaya, I know you're
upset about what happened

129
00:06:39,356 --> 00:06:42,257
to Kuasa, and all I can say is I am...

130
00:06:42,258 --> 00:06:45,026
I'm truly sorry.

131
00:06:45,254 --> 00:06:48,021
I don't blame you for my
granddaughter's death, Nathaniel.

132
00:06:49,232 --> 00:06:52,201
I blame the warlords who
draw closer by the minute.

133
00:06:52,202 --> 00:06:56,406
And I intend to stop them,
so stay out of my way.

134
00:06:58,775 --> 00:07:00,909
I must say, it has been
such an honor, Barack.

135
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:04,579
- Oh, I go by Barry.
- I really like Barack.

136
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,316
Well, Barack is what it says
on my birth certificate.

137
00:07:07,317 --> 00:07:09,118
Yeah, you might want to hold on to that.

138
00:07:12,589 --> 00:07:14,957
So, what's the backup plan?

139
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:18,160
Well, according to Ray's
song, this is a code 2-2-2.

140
00:07:18,161 --> 00:07:19,562
What's that?

141
00:07:19,563 --> 00:07:21,629
It means we're screwed
no matter what we do.

142
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:24,365
All right. Crisis averted.

143
00:07:24,765 --> 00:07:27,635
And a new one's just begun.

144
00:07:27,636 --> 00:07:29,471
You're not getting Obama.

145
00:07:29,472 --> 00:07:31,173
I'm not here for him.

146
00:07:31,174 --> 00:07:34,076
I'm here for my daughter.

147
00:07:34,077 --> 00:07:35,846
And I need your help.

148
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,017
I assure you, this is
completely unnecessary.

149
00:07:42,018 --> 00:07:44,487
I come, as they say, in peace.

150
00:07:44,488 --> 00:07:47,256
And I, as they say, think
you're full of crap.

151
00:07:47,257 --> 00:07:48,491
I'm a changed man, Sara.

152
00:07:48,492 --> 00:07:51,527
The only change I want to see
you go through is from alive to dead.

153
00:07:51,528 --> 00:07:53,729
Ray, how we doing with
Constantine's spell?

154
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:56,165
Just need one more splash of bat spleen.

155
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,166
Sorry, bat.

156
00:07:57,167 --> 00:07:58,435
And that should do it.

157
00:08:01,938 --> 00:08:03,439
Maybe I missed an ingredient.

158
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,374
Your Ankh symbol, it's...
it's upside down.

159
00:08:06,543 --> 00:08:07,776
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

160
00:08:07,777 --> 00:08:08,765
No, it's not!

161
00:08:09,546 --> 00:08:11,313
I knew it'd be difficult to
get you guys to trust me.

162
00:08:12,165 --> 00:08:13,082
Try impossible.

163
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:15,717
Which is why I brought this
gesture of good faith.

164
00:08:15,718 --> 00:08:17,486
The Water Totem.

165
00:08:17,487 --> 00:08:19,155
I borrowed it from my daughter after

166
00:08:19,156 --> 00:08:21,623
she ripped it from Kuasa's chest.

167
00:08:21,624 --> 00:08:22,792
Sorry about that, by the way.

168
00:08:27,531 --> 00:08:29,397
Do you guys mind if I give
you a hand with this?

169
00:08:29,398 --> 00:08:31,500
You seem to be struggling a bit.

170
00:08:31,501 --> 00:08:33,203
Yeah? Okay, great.

171
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:40,676
Cool... Now... try to choke me.

172
00:08:40,677 --> 00:08:43,313
- Really?
- Yeah.

173
00:08:46,447 --> 00:08:47,288
You... you can't.

174
00:08:47,289 --> 00:08:49,285
- Satisfied?
- Yeah.

175
00:08:49,286 --> 00:08:51,187
That Water Totem's gotta
be worth something.

176
00:08:51,188 --> 00:08:52,921
With all six, you guys might actually

177
00:08:52,922 --> 00:08:54,356
have a chance against Mallus.

178
00:08:54,357 --> 00:08:55,691
You mean the same demon you've been

179
00:08:55,692 --> 00:08:56,959
creating anachronisms to release?

180
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,891
That was before I realized what
our partnership would cost me.

181
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:01,030
Nora...

182
00:09:01,031 --> 00:09:03,365
Dies the moment the demon escapes.

183
00:09:03,366 --> 00:09:06,301
Now, I know this might
rankle you a bit, Sara,

184
00:09:06,302 --> 00:09:08,370
but our interests are aligned.

185
00:09:08,371 --> 00:09:11,406
We can save Nora and stop
Mallus from being freed,

186
00:09:11,407 --> 00:09:14,232
together.

187
00:09:14,233 --> 00:09:15,828
- No.
- Excuse me?

188
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:17,346
Rory, kill him.

189
00:09:17,347 --> 00:09:18,513
Wait, no-no-no.

190
00:09:18,514 --> 00:09:20,115
Wait, wait, wait. Okay, look.

191
00:09:20,116 --> 00:09:21,917
I... I know Damien has done
terrible things in his past

192
00:09:21,918 --> 00:09:23,285
which cannot be forgiven,

193
00:09:23,286 --> 00:09:25,755
but I know that he loves his daughter.

194
00:09:25,756 --> 00:09:27,923
- We can't just kill him.
- He was already dead.

195
00:09:27,924 --> 00:09:29,958
Killing him would be
repairing an anachronism.

196
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:32,328
Yeah, so would incarcerating
him in the Bureau.

197
00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:33,930
I agree with Rip.

198
00:09:33,931 --> 00:09:36,097
We need to think through
this situation rationally.

199
00:09:36,098 --> 00:09:37,367
Boss?

200
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,704
Stand down.

201
00:09:42,705 --> 00:09:44,540
I'm glad to see you came to your senses.

202
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,909
Think this makes us
straight, you're wrong.

203
00:09:52,849 --> 00:09:54,449
What are we even doing here, man?

204
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:57,187
We need to stop Amaya, not
party with the village.

205
00:10:00,523 --> 00:10:02,458
There she is.

206
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:05,127
Okay, great, well, let's
get her out of here.

207
00:10:05,128 --> 00:10:07,663
Not our Amaya.

208
00:10:07,664 --> 00:10:09,266
That Amaya.

209
00:10:13,469 --> 00:10:14,436
What's wrong?

210
00:10:14,437 --> 00:10:17,339
Nothing, it just means...

211
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,175
my Amaya comes back to Zambesi

212
00:10:20,176 --> 00:10:23,545
and we don't grow old together.

213
00:10:23,546 --> 00:10:26,215
For thousands of years,

214
00:10:26,216 --> 00:10:30,619
the Anansi Totem has been in my family.

215
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,920
And tonight,

216
00:10:31,921 --> 00:10:36,625
it is my great joy...

217
00:10:36,626 --> 00:10:41,298
to pass this totem down
to my own daughter.

218
00:10:42,532 --> 00:10:44,467
Make way

219
00:10:44,468 --> 00:10:50,006
for the new protector of Zambesi, Esi.

220
00:11:01,718 --> 00:11:05,754
Kuasa, where is Esi, child?

221
00:11:05,755 --> 00:11:09,624
I'm sorry, Nana Baa, but

222
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,695
Mother isn't coming.

223
00:11:16,332 --> 00:11:20,035
My daughter has chosen

224
00:11:20,036 --> 00:11:24,873
to reject her destiny and her duty.

225
00:11:24,874 --> 00:11:26,975
I am sorry.

226
00:11:26,976 --> 00:11:29,478
We have come here for nothing.

227
00:11:39,255 --> 00:11:41,757
Amaya. What just happened?

228
00:11:41,758 --> 00:11:43,759
My daughter rejected the totem.

229
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,327
You sound more excited
than I thought you'd be.

230
00:11:45,328 --> 00:11:47,195
Esi never bonded with the totem.

231
00:11:47,196 --> 00:11:50,300
This is why the warlords were
able to destroy my village.

232
00:11:51,434 --> 00:11:54,069
You think you can convince
Esi to be a totem bearer.

233
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,339
She'll protect the village tomorrow.

234
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:59,274
She'll protect Kuasa.
Everything will change.

235
00:11:59,275 --> 00:12:01,043
That's the problem.

236
00:12:01,044 --> 00:12:02,911
I saw what happened with Barry
Allen when he went back

237
00:12:02,912 --> 00:12:04,213
and stopped his mother's murder,

238
00:12:04,214 --> 00:12:06,581
a little thing called Flashpoint.

239
00:12:06,582 --> 00:12:08,718
We can't change history. I'm sorry.

240
00:12:08,719 --> 00:12:11,654
Tell her, Nate.

241
00:12:11,655 --> 00:12:13,589
Nate?

242
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,856
I can't believe I'm gonna say this,

243
00:12:14,857 --> 00:12:16,626
but screw history for once.

244
00:12:18,327 --> 00:12:20,596
Okay, so you go talk to your daughter,

245
00:12:20,597 --> 00:12:22,131
and I go talk to you,

246
00:12:22,132 --> 00:12:23,932
the older you.

247
00:12:26,302 --> 00:12:28,472
You always had a way with her.

248
00:12:29,939 --> 00:12:31,307
Come on.

249
00:12:31,308 --> 00:12:33,377
Wait, we doing what?

250
00:12:34,778 --> 00:12:37,481
So, listen...

251
00:12:38,781 --> 00:12:40,349
Are you okay?

252
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:42,151
The hardest thing I ever
had to do in my life

253
00:12:42,152 --> 00:12:44,119
was let Darhk live.

254
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,022
And now he's back, and it is taking

255
00:12:47,023 --> 00:12:52,129
every ounce of self-control
not to kill him.

256
00:12:53,329 --> 00:12:58,033
And I keep asking myself, "Why?"

257
00:12:58,034 --> 00:13:00,068
For the good of the mission.

258
00:13:00,069 --> 00:13:01,770
"For the good of the mission."

259
00:13:01,771 --> 00:13:03,138
Listen to yourself.

260
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:04,707
You sound like some government...

261
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:07,443
- Clone?
- I was gonna say "stiff."

262
00:13:07,444 --> 00:13:09,044
You know, Rip thought I could
talk some sense into you,

263
00:13:09,045 --> 00:13:11,312
- but maybe...
- Wait.

264
00:13:11,313 --> 00:13:13,448
You're here because of Rip?

265
00:13:13,449 --> 00:13:16,718
Why would you do anything for that man?

266
00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:18,954
Ava, he lied to you.

267
00:13:18,955 --> 00:13:21,957
He implanted false
memories into your head.

268
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:24,593
He hired actors to pretend
to be your parents.

269
00:13:24,594 --> 00:13:26,128
I mean, what more is it gonna take

270
00:13:26,129 --> 00:13:27,562
to get you to confront him?

271
00:13:27,563 --> 00:13:29,965
I am prioritizing the mission
over my own personal baggage.

272
00:13:29,966 --> 00:13:31,668
You and your team should try it sometime.

273
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:37,272
No, that's not what you're doing.

274
00:13:37,273 --> 00:13:39,007
You're covering,

275
00:13:39,008 --> 00:13:40,876
because you're afraid of
what you might find out.

276
00:13:40,877 --> 00:13:42,577
What else is there to find out, Sara?

277
00:13:42,578 --> 00:13:44,179
I'm one of thousands.
I was grown in a lab.

278
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,081
There has to be more to the story, Ava,

279
00:13:46,082 --> 00:13:48,417
and you deserve to know.

280
00:13:48,418 --> 00:13:50,518
Look, you need...

281
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:53,122
You need to talk to Rip now.

282
00:13:59,596 --> 00:14:03,065
Could do with a wee nip myself.

283
00:14:03,066 --> 00:14:05,066
Everything good, Director Sharpe?

284
00:14:05,067 --> 00:14:06,202
Peachy.

285
00:14:06,203 --> 00:14:07,869
Are we good to

286
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,972
transport Mr. Darhk back to the Bureau?

287
00:14:10,973 --> 00:14:14,543
No, Rip, we're not.

288
00:14:14,709 --> 00:14:15,603
Where are you going?

289
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,612
To go talk to someone
who can think straight

290
00:14:17,613 --> 00:14:19,882
when the whole world has gone crazy.

291
00:14:19,883 --> 00:14:22,117
So what you're saying is

292
00:14:22,118 --> 00:14:24,686
you won't aid the man
that killed your sister,

293
00:14:24,687 --> 00:14:27,155
even if it will prevent
Mollusk from escaping...

294
00:14:27,156 --> 00:14:28,690
"Mallus."

295
00:14:28,691 --> 00:14:31,659
From escaping his
inter-dimensional prison

296
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,695
and wreaking havoc across time?

297
00:14:33,696 --> 00:14:35,264
Yeah, when you put it that way,

298
00:14:35,265 --> 00:14:36,565
it does sound kind of petty.

299
00:14:36,566 --> 00:14:39,068
Not at all. It sounds...

300
00:14:39,069 --> 00:14:40,102
It sounds human.

301
00:14:40,103 --> 00:14:42,570
Okay. But then what?

302
00:14:42,571 --> 00:14:44,773
I'm just supposed to
hand Darhk over to Ava

303
00:14:44,774 --> 00:14:47,075
and let the Time Bureau deal with him?

304
00:14:47,076 --> 00:14:50,379
Your ex is clinging to
rules and regulations

305
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,214
in the face of the startling revelation

306
00:14:52,215 --> 00:14:54,182
that she is...

307
00:14:54,183 --> 00:14:56,952
I'm sorry... a clone, was it?

308
00:14:56,953 --> 00:14:59,521
But here's the thing.

309
00:14:59,522 --> 00:15:02,758
I'm not convinced the
Bureau is best equipped

310
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:05,194
to stop a demon.

311
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,929
No, it sounds like that calls for

312
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:11,801
a much more unorthodox approach.

313
00:15:14,837 --> 00:15:16,907
I really miss you.

314
00:15:23,187 --> 00:15:25,214
Oh, hi guys.

315
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,282
I do hope you're not feeling all

316
00:15:27,283 --> 00:15:29,184
killy-killy, stabby-stabby.

317
00:15:29,185 --> 00:15:32,554
I want you to listen to me carefully.

318
00:15:32,555 --> 00:15:35,257
I don't believe for a
second that you've changed.

319
00:15:35,258 --> 00:15:38,026
You're still the same
cowardly son of a bitch

320
00:15:38,027 --> 00:15:39,994
that put an arrow in my sister.

321
00:15:39,995 --> 00:15:42,364
But I will work with you to defeat Mallus

322
00:15:42,365 --> 00:15:43,999
under one condition.

323
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,667
After this is over,

324
00:15:45,668 --> 00:15:49,037
I'm putting you back in the
ground where you belong.

325
00:15:49,038 --> 00:15:50,173
Deal.

326
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:07,842
Is... so, do any of these flashing
screens actually do anything?

327
00:16:07,843 --> 00:16:09,175
Focus, Damien.

328
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,078
How do we capture your demon daughter?

329
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:12,879
If we coordinate a strike

330
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,481
between the Legends and the Time Bureau,

331
00:16:14,482 --> 00:16:16,583
we might be able to take her down.

332
00:16:16,584 --> 00:16:18,785
How did that work for you
in Victorian London?

333
00:16:18,786 --> 00:16:22,890
Besides, my little angel's only
gotten more powerful since.

334
00:16:22,891 --> 00:16:25,225
What if we just ask Nora nicely?

335
00:16:25,527 --> 00:16:28,028
I did have a bit of a
connection with her in Berlin.

336
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:29,863
Not that kind.

337
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:32,599
All right, maybe she'll
listen to her dear old dad.

338
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,201
Not anymore. Nora only
listens to Mallus now.

339
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,437
He's always in her ear.

340
00:16:37,525 --> 00:16:40,407
That's it. What if I got inside Nora?!

341
00:16:40,408 --> 00:16:42,976
Not like that.

342
00:16:42,977 --> 00:16:44,778
What if I shrunk down,

343
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:48,181
flew into her ear and
pretended to be Mallus?

344
00:16:48,182 --> 00:16:49,583
Okay, new guy on the team here.

345
00:16:49,584 --> 00:16:51,084
Is that a joke plan or a real plan?

346
00:16:51,085 --> 00:16:53,320
- We are so screwed.
- No, this could work.

347
00:16:53,321 --> 00:16:55,956
We just have to convince her
that it's actually him.

348
00:16:55,957 --> 00:16:59,493
This is how you would serve your city.

349
00:16:59,494 --> 00:17:02,429
You would risk its utter ruin.

350
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,831
That's it.

351
00:17:03,832 --> 00:17:06,133
I did what I judged to be right.

352
00:17:06,134 --> 00:17:09,570
What you judged to be right?

353
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:12,639
You sent the Ring of Power into Mordor,

354
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,175
in the hands of a witless halfling!

355
00:17:15,176 --> 00:17:19,112
Whoa, the vocal similarity
to Mallus is uncanny.

356
00:17:19,113 --> 00:17:21,481
- Quiet!
- Gideon?

357
00:17:21,482 --> 00:17:23,116
Who is that actor?

358
00:17:23,117 --> 00:17:25,654
And how can we get him without
dealing with his agent?

359
00:17:25,703 --> 00:17:27,396
- DENETHOR
- Red leather, yellow leather. Yeah?

360
00:17:27,397 --> 00:17:28,283
NEW ZEALAND - 1999

361
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:29,923
- Mis... mister Noble?
- What?

362
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:32,092
We have some... last-minute rewrites.

363
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:34,161
No worries! We'll fix 'em in post!

364
00:17:34,162 --> 00:17:38,732
Tell Peter Jackson no more chickens, huh?

365
00:17:38,733 --> 00:17:40,900
I ate four this morning, eh?

366
00:17:40,901 --> 00:17:42,503
- So what's up, mate?
- Yeah, so.

367
00:17:42,504 --> 00:17:44,104
Rewrites... from Peter.

368
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:46,106
And he'd like me to...
run lines with you.

369
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,707
You're kidding.

370
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:50,911
Okay. Let's see.

371
00:17:50,912 --> 00:17:53,180
"Nora, you must heed my command."

372
00:17:53,181 --> 00:17:54,548
That's good. That's good.

373
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:56,183
- Who's Nora?
- Nora.

374
00:17:56,184 --> 00:17:58,218
Nora, she's a new character that...

375
00:17:58,219 --> 00:18:01,388
well... they wanted to beef up
the female presence in the film.

376
00:18:01,389 --> 00:18:02,690
You can't do that, mate.

377
00:18:02,691 --> 00:18:04,024
It's Tolkien, "Lord of the Rings."

378
00:18:04,025 --> 00:18:06,459
I know... but it's a studio note.

379
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,529
Oh, studio note. Very good
note, yeah, all right.

380
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:09,963
Yeah, from the top?

381
00:18:11,699 --> 00:18:13,934
"Nora, you must heed my command."

382
00:18:14,167 --> 00:18:15,635
"What is it, Master?"

383
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,637
"Go to the Waverider, Nora."

384
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,606
"I cannot go to the Waverider."

385
00:18:19,607 --> 00:18:22,909
"The totems are ripe for the picking."

386
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,210
This is crap, isn't it? Aye?

387
00:18:24,211 --> 00:18:26,045
- Oh, well...
- I mean, who wrote this?

388
00:18:26,046 --> 00:18:27,581
- I mean, somebody...
- Don't... don't worry about it.

389
00:18:27,582 --> 00:18:28,915
- Took a lot of time...
- Don't worry about it.

390
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,617
"The totems are ripe for the picking.

391
00:18:30,618 --> 00:18:32,586
Your father will lead you to them."

392
00:18:32,587 --> 00:18:33,370
"My father?"

393
00:18:37,592 --> 00:18:41,094
Esi.

394
00:18:41,095 --> 00:18:42,963
Who are you?

395
00:18:42,964 --> 00:18:45,298
I am a distant cousin.

396
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:47,433
I came for the ceremony.

397
00:18:47,434 --> 00:18:49,237
Sorry to disappoint you.

398
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:53,874
I love it here.

399
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,408
When I was a child,

400
00:18:55,409 --> 00:18:58,879
I'd come here and lose
myself in the stars,

401
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,415
think about where my life would lead.

402
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:06,220
For as long as I can remember,

403
00:19:06,221 --> 00:19:10,156
the Anansi Totem has been my destiny.

404
00:19:10,157 --> 00:19:11,591
But now,

405
00:19:11,592 --> 00:19:16,262
I'm not sure I want it.

406
00:19:16,263 --> 00:19:18,899
- You wouldn't understand.
- Try me.

407
00:19:21,936 --> 00:19:25,972
My mother is the great Amaya Jiwe.

408
00:19:25,973 --> 00:19:29,776
She's protected our
village her entire life.

409
00:19:29,777 --> 00:19:32,946
She never doubted, never wavered.

410
00:19:32,947 --> 00:19:35,115
That's not true.

411
00:19:35,116 --> 00:19:40,154
Every totem bearer starts
their journey with doubt.

412
00:19:40,155 --> 00:19:42,423
Even your mother.

413
00:19:42,424 --> 00:19:44,624
I will never live up to her legacy.

414
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,393
You have her strength

415
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:49,996
and the strength of all others
who've come before her.

416
00:19:49,997 --> 00:19:52,566
But there is danger coming,

417
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:55,102
and your people need you
to stand up for them.

418
00:20:12,353 --> 00:20:14,121
All right, you fathwoom into Amaya's hut,

419
00:20:14,122 --> 00:20:16,189
grab the totem, and we'll
give it to her daughter.

420
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,792
Nate, I... now that you
have some space from her,

421
00:20:18,793 --> 00:20:20,527
I need you to come to your senses.

422
00:20:20,528 --> 00:20:22,228
Amaya can't see this, she's too close.

423
00:20:22,229 --> 00:20:24,231
But she's going to cause
more harm than good

424
00:20:24,232 --> 00:20:25,365
if this releases Mallus.

425
00:20:25,366 --> 00:20:26,933
- We don't know that.
- We do.

426
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,069
You do.

427
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:36,309
I can't not help her, Wally.

428
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:38,478
I love you, man, but I will stop you

429
00:20:38,479 --> 00:20:42,183
if you take this too far.

430
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:55,963
Like stealing candy from a very old baby.

431
00:21:22,968 --> 00:21:24,378
Oh, Amaya, wait.

432
00:21:24,379 --> 00:21:25,959
It's me.

433
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,460
You know, I didn't think
this would do it for me,

434
00:21:27,461 --> 00:21:28,657
but it actually kind of does.

435
00:21:28,658 --> 00:21:29,636
Who are you?!

436
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,931
- It's me, Nate.
- Who?

437
00:21:31,932 --> 00:21:33,266
Nate.

438
00:21:33,267 --> 00:21:34,701
I know it's been a while,

439
00:21:34,702 --> 00:21:36,069
but we used to travel
through time together.

440
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,438
You know, do other things...

441
00:21:38,439 --> 00:21:40,173
If this is some kind of a joke...

442
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:41,075
It's not a joke.

443
00:21:41,076 --> 00:21:43,723
I have pictures of us

444
00:21:43,724 --> 00:21:45,078
on my phone.

445
00:21:55,322 --> 00:21:57,157
This is me.

446
00:21:57,158 --> 00:21:59,926
Of course.

447
00:21:59,927 --> 00:22:01,294
You really don't remember, do you?

448
00:22:01,295 --> 00:22:02,662
How is this possible?

449
00:22:02,663 --> 00:22:04,230
We were part of a bitchin' team

450
00:22:04,231 --> 00:22:05,632
that travelled through time together...

451
00:22:05,633 --> 00:22:07,467
I mean, the 1942 you.

452
00:22:07,468 --> 00:22:11,271
Why are you here, time traveler?

453
00:22:11,272 --> 00:22:15,141
To keep my promise to you,

454
00:22:15,142 --> 00:22:17,577
by making sure your daughter Esi

455
00:22:17,578 --> 00:22:20,280
gets the Spirit Totem tonight.

456
00:22:20,281 --> 00:22:23,716
She didn't even show up
to her own ceremony.

457
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:27,687
Her head is always somewhere else.

458
00:22:27,688 --> 00:22:30,091
She doesn't know what she wants.

459
00:22:32,292 --> 00:22:33,760
Yeah, you had a hard time

460
00:22:33,761 --> 00:22:35,729
figuring that out too
when you were her age.

461
00:22:37,865 --> 00:22:42,502
But, look, if Esi believed you
were truly in her corner,

462
00:22:42,503 --> 00:22:44,804
she wouldn't doubt herself.

463
00:22:44,805 --> 00:22:47,875
She would accept the totem
and be unstoppable,

464
00:22:47,876 --> 00:22:50,178
just like you.

465
00:22:56,663 --> 00:22:58,752
Hey there, Nora doll.

466
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:00,420
Why am I still here?

467
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:02,623
Why is the Master still in prison?

468
00:23:02,624 --> 00:23:04,057
You failed me!

469
00:23:04,058 --> 00:23:05,225
I know, it's terrible.

470
00:23:05,226 --> 00:23:06,959
The Legends captured Grodd,

471
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,794
and this whole Obama thing
is just not working,

472
00:23:08,795 --> 00:23:12,032
so perhaps Mallus can advise us

473
00:23:12,033 --> 00:23:14,135
as to what to do next.

474
00:23:18,038 --> 00:23:21,274
Mallus only speaks when he desires.

475
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:23,443
I can't just "summon" him.

476
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:24,545
Well, maybe we'll just...

477
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:27,080
Wait here until he

478
00:23:27,081 --> 00:23:28,716
gets the itch.

479
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,651
- PLAY
- Nora.

480
00:23:32,012 --> 00:23:34,588
You must heed my command.

481
00:23:34,589 --> 00:23:36,723
It's him. He's speaking to me.

482
00:23:37,388 --> 00:23:38,625
Very loudly.

483
00:23:39,894 --> 00:23:42,295
Really? Mallus is speaking to you?

484
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:44,630
I need to concentrate.

485
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:48,034
Go to the Waverider, Nora.

486
00:23:48,035 --> 00:23:50,503
The Waverider, why?

487
00:23:50,504 --> 00:23:54,341
The totems are ripe for the picking.

488
00:23:54,342 --> 00:23:56,509
Your father will lead you to them.

489
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,811
My father?

490
00:23:57,812 --> 00:24:00,580
What... what... Mallus has plans for me?

491
00:24:00,581 --> 00:24:01,781
I... I wonder what those are.

492
00:24:01,782 --> 00:24:03,683
The... the... the Legends' ship.

493
00:24:03,684 --> 00:24:05,518
The Master wants you to take me there.

494
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:08,388
Oh, I would in a heartbeat,

495
00:24:08,389 --> 00:24:10,423
but we are hopelessly outnumbered, honey.

496
00:24:10,424 --> 00:24:11,724
There's just no way...

497
00:24:11,725 --> 00:24:13,160
He must take you there now, Nora.

498
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:14,260
Just do it!

499
00:24:14,261 --> 00:24:16,096
God, do it! Don't be a fool!

500
00:24:16,097 --> 00:24:18,065
No problemo. Let's go.

501
00:24:22,269 --> 00:24:26,206
Those totems should be
around here somewhere.

502
00:24:34,982 --> 00:24:36,083
You.

503
00:24:41,088 --> 00:24:42,188
What is this?

504
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:43,256
I'm sorry, sweetheart,

505
00:24:43,257 --> 00:24:44,424
but it's for your own good.

506
00:24:44,425 --> 00:24:45,626
No.

507
00:24:47,581 --> 00:24:50,164
No!

508
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:58,097
I get it.

509
00:24:58,098 --> 00:24:59,432
You think that I failed you

510
00:24:59,433 --> 00:25:00,599
because I joined with the Legends

511
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,867
and trapped you here.

512
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:03,903
Well, you're right.

513
00:25:03,904 --> 00:25:05,304
I did fail you.

514
00:25:05,305 --> 00:25:07,038
But that's not how.

515
00:25:07,629 --> 00:25:09,408
I was a terrible father.

516
00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:13,012
I was obsessed with world domination.

517
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:15,547
Because of that...

518
00:25:15,548 --> 00:25:17,082
I died,

519
00:25:17,083 --> 00:25:20,819
leaving you all alone as a child,

520
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:25,625
trapped with my name
and my foolish dreams.

521
00:25:25,626 --> 00:25:28,695
Oh, I turned you into a demon
long before Mallus did.

522
00:25:29,796 --> 00:25:31,930
It's why I'm begging you,

523
00:25:31,931 --> 00:25:35,334
do not let him take you away from me.

524
00:25:35,335 --> 00:25:38,804
Your daughter is long gone.

525
00:25:38,805 --> 00:25:40,105
No!

526
00:25:40,106 --> 00:25:42,674
I know you can hear me. Fight him!

527
00:25:42,675 --> 00:25:45,244
Oh, there was no fight.

528
00:25:45,245 --> 00:25:49,448
Her soul...

529
00:25:49,449 --> 00:25:52,418
her flesh...

530
00:25:52,419 --> 00:25:55,521
were freely given.

531
00:25:55,522 --> 00:25:57,323
You sick son of a bitch.

532
00:25:59,426 --> 00:26:01,561
One more alteration to the timeline

533
00:26:01,562 --> 00:26:03,596
and my cage crumbles.

534
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:14,440
Can't believe that worked.

535
00:26:14,441 --> 00:26:15,641
I can.

536
00:26:15,642 --> 00:26:17,677
Sara knows what she's doing.

537
00:26:17,678 --> 00:26:19,712
I may have my flaws, but I do know

538
00:26:19,713 --> 00:26:23,282
how to pick the best people for the job.

539
00:26:23,283 --> 00:26:24,683
So why did you pick me?

540
00:26:24,684 --> 00:26:26,385
What? Come on.

541
00:26:26,386 --> 00:26:29,322
Brilliant mind, calm demeanor,
incredible strength.

542
00:26:29,323 --> 00:26:33,225
And, unlike the Legends,
you actually follow rules.

543
00:26:33,226 --> 00:26:36,262
It almost sounds like I
was made for the job.

544
00:26:36,263 --> 00:26:39,131
What are you getting at?

545
00:26:39,132 --> 00:26:41,166
I know I'm a clone, Rip.

546
00:26:41,167 --> 00:26:43,102
I see.

547
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:44,089
So why me?

548
00:26:46,339 --> 00:26:49,041
Of all the clones in 2213,
why did you pick me?

549
00:26:49,042 --> 00:26:50,743
You're special.

550
00:26:50,744 --> 00:26:52,845
So why'd you erase my memory?

551
00:26:52,846 --> 00:26:55,313
- I thought it would be easier.
- Easier?

552
00:26:55,314 --> 00:26:57,182
Easier for you or easier for me?

553
00:26:57,183 --> 00:26:58,951
Don't lose focus, Ava.

554
00:26:58,952 --> 00:27:00,819
You are too critical to this mission.

555
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,121
Well, the good news is if I die,

556
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:05,759
you can just skip off to 2213,
and get yourself another clone.

557
00:27:07,594 --> 00:27:10,829
Oh, my God.

558
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,431
I wasn't even the first one, was I?

559
00:27:12,432 --> 00:27:14,333
We both know how hard it is

560
00:27:14,334 --> 00:27:16,768
to find agents as talented as you.

561
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:19,738
And to find one who is also
replaceable is invaluable...

562
00:27:19,739 --> 00:27:21,440
How many?

563
00:27:21,441 --> 00:27:24,076
How many?

564
00:27:24,077 --> 00:27:26,645
You're the 12th.

565
00:27:26,646 --> 00:27:29,448
The 12th?

566
00:27:29,449 --> 00:27:31,149
So I wasn't even your first choice?

567
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,451
Or your second or...

568
00:27:32,452 --> 00:27:34,219
You don't understand.

569
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:37,356
- You are exceptional.
- Don't, Rip.

570
00:27:37,357 --> 00:27:39,492
Just don't.

571
00:27:46,433 --> 00:27:48,200
Nora's gone.

572
00:27:48,201 --> 00:27:50,535
It's just Mallus now.

573
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:51,970
You must be enjoying this,

574
00:27:51,971 --> 00:27:54,240
seeing your nemesis with a broken heart.

575
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:57,609
I didn't know you had a heart to break.

576
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:01,781
Where was it the night
you murdered my sister?

577
00:28:01,782 --> 00:28:04,216
Look, what I did was unforgivable.

578
00:28:04,217 --> 00:28:05,851
But back then, I hadn't
loved anyone enough

579
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:08,821
to understand the pain that I caused.

580
00:28:08,822 --> 00:28:12,458
Not that it's any comfort, but
if I could take it all back,

581
00:28:12,459 --> 00:28:14,360
I would.

582
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:16,662
We all have regrets.

583
00:28:16,663 --> 00:28:19,865
But we can't undo the
things that we've done.

584
00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:22,568
True.

585
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:25,404
But even the worst of us
can be made whole again.

586
00:28:25,405 --> 00:28:27,439
You, for example.

587
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,709
League to Legend to killer to captain.

588
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,010
That's not a bad makeover, is it?

589
00:28:31,011 --> 00:28:33,512
- It's not good enough.
- Why?

590
00:28:33,513 --> 00:28:34,813
Because you put on the Death Totem

591
00:28:34,814 --> 00:28:36,348
and almost killed your entire team?

592
00:28:36,349 --> 00:28:38,584
- Yes.
- But you didn't, did you?

593
00:28:38,585 --> 00:28:40,252
You know why?

594
00:28:40,253 --> 00:28:41,753
The same reason I'm spilling my guts to

595
00:28:41,754 --> 00:28:44,223
a woman who's imagined my
death 1,000 times over.

596
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:45,791
More like 10,000.

597
00:28:45,792 --> 00:28:49,428
Love! Sara.

598
00:28:49,429 --> 00:28:51,230
'Cause without it, people like us,

599
00:28:51,231 --> 00:28:54,734
we're left alone with the darkness.

600
00:28:54,735 --> 00:28:56,369
That's not good for anyone, is it?

601
00:29:11,551 --> 00:29:15,154
I'm so proud of you, my child.

602
00:29:18,127 --> 00:29:20,393
Esi's embraced her destiny.

603
00:29:20,394 --> 00:29:22,962
Tomorrow when the marauders
come, she'll be ready.

604
00:29:22,963 --> 00:29:25,431
And if she's not, we'll be right
there to fight alongside her.

605
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:27,633
You don't have to stay, Nathaniel.

606
00:29:27,634 --> 00:29:29,467
I know that what I did was selfish.

607
00:29:29,468 --> 00:29:33,205
You couldn't be selfish if you tried.

608
00:29:33,206 --> 00:29:36,908
Now, you see that boomin'
granny over there?

609
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:39,845
She doesn't remember me,

610
00:29:39,846 --> 00:29:41,580
or the Legends.

611
00:29:41,581 --> 00:29:44,916
You know why that is?

612
00:29:44,917 --> 00:29:47,953
I must have erased my memory.

613
00:29:47,954 --> 00:29:50,856
And why would you do that?

614
00:29:50,857 --> 00:29:53,292
Because if I chose to come back here,

615
00:29:53,293 --> 00:29:56,461
after everything we've been through, then

616
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:58,264
erasing you would be the only way

617
00:29:58,265 --> 00:30:01,133
that I could be the protector
my people deserve.

618
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:04,870
Otherwise, I'd always be split in two.

619
00:30:04,871 --> 00:30:08,974
And part of me would be in love with you.

620
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:10,976
I tried to reason with them,
but they won't listen.

621
00:30:10,977 --> 00:30:12,444
Amaya is dead set on saving her village.

622
00:30:12,445 --> 00:30:13,845
And Nate? He's just...

623
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:15,314
- Whipped.
- I was gonna say "in love."

624
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:15,914
But, yeah, same thing.

625
00:30:15,915 --> 00:30:18,010
Zari, please tell me that
you found a loophole

626
00:30:18,011 --> 00:30:19,951
that allows Amaya to save her village.

627
00:30:19,952 --> 00:30:21,487
There is no loophole.

628
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:23,221
I've tried billions of variations,

629
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:25,290
but this event has too
many ripple effects.

630
00:30:25,291 --> 00:30:26,992
The village has to be destroyed.

631
00:30:26,993 --> 00:30:28,160
Or Mallus is freed.

632
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:31,897
And we're all doomed.

633
00:30:31,898 --> 00:30:33,632
What if we're not?

634
00:30:36,469 --> 00:30:37,937
We have the six totems,

635
00:30:37,938 --> 00:30:39,905
the only thing that Mallus is afraid of.

636
00:30:39,906 --> 00:30:42,441
But you can't fight what you can't see.

637
00:30:42,442 --> 00:30:45,510
What if the only way to kill
Mallus is to let him out?

638
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:48,381
Are you really suggesting that
we allow Mallus to escape

639
00:30:48,382 --> 00:30:50,282
because you have a collection
of magical stones?

640
00:30:50,283 --> 00:30:52,851
Look, we have two choices: we
fight Amaya or we fight Mallus.

641
00:30:52,852 --> 00:30:55,353
And I know it sounds crazy
to let a time demon out,

642
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,188
but it's a hell of a
lot easier to stomach

643
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:58,857
than turning on a friend.

644
00:30:58,858 --> 00:31:00,759
Okay, yes, but didn't the
original totem bearers

645
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,028
try and face Mallus and... and blow it?

646
00:31:03,029 --> 00:31:05,030
Constantine said the only reason
they couldn't kill Mallus

647
00:31:05,031 --> 00:31:08,000
was because the Death
Totem betrayed them.

648
00:31:08,001 --> 00:31:09,401
And that's not gonna happen this time.

649
00:31:09,402 --> 00:31:10,736
How can you be so sure?

650
00:31:10,737 --> 00:31:12,103
I needn't remind you what happened

651
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:13,338
the last time you tried to wield it.

652
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:15,474
She won't have to wield it.

653
00:31:15,475 --> 00:31:18,043
I will.

654
00:31:18,044 --> 00:31:20,245
The Death Totem was
attracted to Captain Lance

655
00:31:20,246 --> 00:31:22,314
because of a unique
quality we both share.

656
00:31:22,315 --> 00:31:24,349
We were both brought back from the dead.

657
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,385
Plus, I have a personal stake

658
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:28,353
in wanting to send
Mallus straight to Hell.

659
00:31:28,354 --> 00:31:31,056
He took my little girl.

660
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:32,424
True as that may be,

661
00:31:32,425 --> 00:31:34,026
there is no chance that Captain Lance

662
00:31:34,027 --> 00:31:36,128
would trust you with
such a dangerous weapon.

663
00:31:39,032 --> 00:31:40,699
Death Totem's all yours.

664
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,300
Sara, you can't be serious.

665
00:31:42,301 --> 00:31:44,002
Ava, we don't have a choice.

666
00:31:44,003 --> 00:31:46,338
Our only choice is to stop Amaya
and stop the anachronisms.

667
00:31:46,339 --> 00:31:47,539
This is insanity.

668
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,842
Insane is what we do best, Ava.

669
00:31:49,843 --> 00:31:51,477
I will not condone this behavior,

670
00:31:51,478 --> 00:31:53,512
and the Bureau certainly
does not stand behind you.

671
00:31:53,513 --> 00:31:55,280
Rip, let's go. We have work to do.

672
00:31:55,281 --> 00:31:56,949
Remember when I told you that
we would need the Legends

673
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,550
before this was through?

674
00:31:58,551 --> 00:32:01,986
Perhaps it is time that
we set aside the scalpel

675
00:32:01,987 --> 00:32:06,058
and let them be the chainsaw.

676
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:09,561
I will consider that your resignation.

677
00:32:09,562 --> 00:32:11,730
Ava.

678
00:32:11,731 --> 00:32:13,333
Ava, wait.

679
00:32:19,005 --> 00:32:20,638
This plan can work and you know it.

680
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:22,608
You just need to trust your gut.

681
00:32:22,609 --> 00:32:24,520
My gut?

682
00:32:24,521 --> 00:32:27,412
You mean the one that was
manufactured to factory settings?

683
00:32:27,413 --> 00:32:29,853
That's the same gut that 11 other
Avas used and got killed?

684
00:32:29,854 --> 00:32:32,785
Ava, please. Just trust me.

685
00:32:32,786 --> 00:32:34,219
You don't understand.

686
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,221
This plan breaks every
rule in every book,

687
00:32:36,222 --> 00:32:39,090
and all I have right now
are the rules, okay?

688
00:32:39,091 --> 00:32:41,260
You have me.

689
00:32:49,235 --> 00:32:51,337
What are you doing?

690
00:32:51,338 --> 00:32:55,607
I'm admitting something
that could save us both.

691
00:32:55,608 --> 00:32:59,379
I love you.

692
00:33:00,247 --> 00:33:03,949
There is no "me" to love.

693
00:33:16,764 --> 00:33:18,365
She looks good out there,

694
00:33:18,366 --> 00:33:20,133
ready.

695
00:33:20,134 --> 00:33:23,404
Like mother, like daughter.

696
00:33:24,782 --> 00:33:25,949
The warlords are early.

697
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,351
Hey! Oh, no.

698
00:33:27,352 --> 00:33:29,220
- Don't puma-pounce us.
- Really, Wally?

699
00:33:29,221 --> 00:33:31,355
- You're gonna do this?
- It's not like that, Nate.

700
00:33:31,356 --> 00:33:33,991
- I know why you're here.
- No, no, you really don't.

701
00:33:33,992 --> 00:33:36,259
Short version: Nora's on the
ship, tripping on Mallus juice.

702
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,661
Damien Darhk gave us the Water Totem

703
00:33:37,662 --> 00:33:38,895
after they saved Barack Obama.

704
00:33:38,896 --> 00:33:40,531
And... we are here to help you

705
00:33:40,532 --> 00:33:42,399
create the anachronisms
so we can release Mallus,

706
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,668
and then we can kill him.

707
00:33:44,669 --> 00:33:45,938
Oh, and I met John Noble.

708
00:33:48,173 --> 00:33:50,474
So you're working with Damien Darhk?

709
00:33:50,475 --> 00:33:51,942
Please, don't rub it in.

710
00:33:51,943 --> 00:33:53,344
And you're letting him
wield the Death Totem.

711
00:33:53,345 --> 00:33:55,746
In order to do justice
for someone I love.

712
00:33:55,747 --> 00:33:57,147
Sure you can understand that.

713
00:33:57,148 --> 00:33:58,782
Thankfully that is our only similarity.

714
00:33:59,611 --> 00:34:00,632
So.

715
00:34:00,633 --> 00:34:02,052
Who gets Earth? Who gets Water?

716
00:34:02,053 --> 00:34:05,121
Well, as a man of steel,
which is an element,

717
00:34:05,122 --> 00:34:07,224
I always felt a strong
connection to the earth.

718
00:34:07,225 --> 00:34:09,392
Actually, steel is an
alloy of iron and carbon.

719
00:34:09,393 --> 00:34:11,027
Also, I've watched every single episode

720
00:34:11,028 --> 00:34:12,496
of "Planet Earth" on Blu-ray,

721
00:34:12,497 --> 00:34:14,297
and I was only stoned all of the time.

722
00:34:14,298 --> 00:34:15,999
Can I just please have the damn totem?

723
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,368
- Thank you.
- All yours.

724
00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:19,102
And Water? Anyone?

725
00:34:19,103 --> 00:34:21,472
Actually, water is really powerful.

726
00:34:21,473 --> 00:34:23,373
It... it's crucial to life on Earth.

727
00:34:23,374 --> 00:34:25,275
And did you know that we
are made up of 60% water?

728
00:34:25,276 --> 00:34:26,377
- If...
- All right, I think we get it.

729
00:34:26,378 --> 00:34:27,711
Take a totem.

730
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,745
Oh, I wasn't making a pitch for one.

731
00:34:28,746 --> 00:34:29,780
Just take the totem!

732
00:34:29,781 --> 00:34:30,948
Okay, cool.

733
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:32,349
All right, so is there, like,

734
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:34,418
an instruction manual? A YouTube video?

735
00:34:34,419 --> 00:34:35,719
You better figure it out.

736
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,888
Warlords are coming, and that means

737
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:39,824
Mallus is about to make his debut.

738
00:34:42,861 --> 00:34:45,962
Dad?

739
00:34:45,963 --> 00:34:48,065
Nora.

740
00:34:48,066 --> 00:34:51,001
You're here but... how?

741
00:34:51,002 --> 00:34:54,071
The totem means you're dead.

742
00:34:54,072 --> 00:34:57,674
No, not yet.

743
00:34:57,675 --> 00:35:02,079
Mallus is trying to take me,
but I'm still fighting him.

744
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,146
For now.

745
00:35:03,147 --> 00:35:06,283
But Dad?

746
00:35:06,284 --> 00:35:08,885
I made a mistake.

747
00:35:08,886 --> 00:35:10,721
I'm sorry.

748
00:35:10,722 --> 00:35:12,422
I don't want him to take me.

749
00:35:12,423 --> 00:35:15,091
Please don't let him take me. I'm scared.

750
00:35:15,774 --> 00:35:16,961
You ready?

751
00:35:23,511 --> 00:35:25,836
Yeah, let's do this before it's too late.

752
00:35:34,755 --> 00:35:37,481
This place has been sacred to my
people since the dawn of time.

753
00:35:37,482 --> 00:35:38,849
The totems will be strongest here.

754
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:40,117
Well, they'd better be,

755
00:35:40,118 --> 00:35:41,552
'cause mine's not turning on.

756
00:35:44,088 --> 00:35:45,556
It's time.

757
00:35:45,557 --> 00:35:47,690
As soon as Esi defeats the warlords,

758
00:35:47,691 --> 00:35:49,527
our fight against Mallus begins.

759
00:36:03,875 --> 00:36:05,542
Should we help your daughter?

760
00:36:05,543 --> 00:36:07,411
Esi's got this.

761
00:36:07,412 --> 00:36:09,312
No-no-no! No-no-no!

762
00:36:09,313 --> 00:36:11,648
Looks like it's time to meet our monster.

763
00:36:11,649 --> 00:36:12,849
Or our maker.

764
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:14,219
I'm not dying today.

765
00:36:16,754 --> 00:36:18,923
Here's Mallus.

766
00:36:23,094 --> 00:36:24,962
Why isn't she transforming?

767
00:36:24,963 --> 00:36:26,030
Rip, what gives?

768
00:36:26,031 --> 00:36:28,765
The historical record is showing
that Zambesi's still destroyed.

769
00:36:28,766 --> 00:36:30,133
That doesn't make any sense.

770
00:36:30,134 --> 00:36:31,436
The battle's over. The good guys won.

771
00:36:34,439 --> 00:36:36,873
- Rip, what's going on?
- Oh, my God.

772
00:36:36,874 --> 00:36:38,541
The warlords don't destroy the village.

773
00:36:38,542 --> 00:36:40,878
The village was destroyed by

774
00:36:40,879 --> 00:36:42,980
an angry gorilla.

775
00:36:49,754 --> 00:36:51,388
I had to. She's my daughter.

776
00:36:51,389 --> 00:36:52,622
You released Grodd.

777
00:36:52,623 --> 00:36:55,527
I need history to run its course.

778
00:37:05,761 --> 00:37:06,861
Your time must end.

779
00:37:06,862 --> 00:37:08,229
This way! Quick.

780
00:37:09,168 --> 00:37:10,969
You should go too, Maame.

781
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:13,114
I can handle this beast.

782
00:37:13,115 --> 00:37:15,741
I believe in you, Obabaa.

783
00:37:35,194 --> 00:37:36,962
Esi.

784
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,264
No.

785
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:44,102
Amaya! Amaya!

786
00:37:44,103 --> 00:37:46,438
Hey, hey, are you okay?

787
00:37:47,861 --> 00:37:48,874
I'm okay.

788
00:37:51,444 --> 00:37:53,811
Nate, my family...

789
00:37:53,812 --> 00:37:55,213
I won't let them die.

790
00:37:55,214 --> 00:37:56,881
I promise.

791
00:37:56,882 --> 00:37:59,751
Damien, Mallus is coming.
This won't save Nora.

792
00:37:59,752 --> 00:38:01,486
If there's a chance in
hell, I'm gonna take it.

793
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:02,922
I'll handle this.

794
00:38:06,759 --> 00:38:10,295
"Always incapacitate
your speedster first."

795
00:38:10,296 --> 00:38:11,531
That's day one stuff.

796
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,434
Let him go.

797
00:38:20,939 --> 00:38:23,041
I'm warning you, don't stand in my way.

798
00:38:23,042 --> 00:38:25,209
I was powerful before I had this trinket,

799
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:26,911
but now I'm unstoppable.

800
00:38:26,912 --> 00:38:28,614
Yeah, we've heard that one before.

801
00:38:33,952 --> 00:38:35,353
I don't want to kill you.

802
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:37,088
I want to kill them to save my daughter!

803
00:38:37,089 --> 00:38:39,024
Why can't you understand that?!

804
00:39:03,149 --> 00:39:04,849
Can't move.

805
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:06,151
What is happening?

806
00:39:06,152 --> 00:39:07,919
Foolish human.

807
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,956
You are now mine to control.

808
00:39:10,957 --> 00:39:12,757
You will not harm my village!

809
00:39:12,758 --> 00:39:15,127
Maame! Get away from him!

810
00:39:26,672 --> 00:39:28,107
It worked!

811
00:39:29,842 --> 00:39:31,444
Amaya.

812
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:39,952
Nathaniel.

813
00:39:43,189 --> 00:39:45,790
I... I didn't take you
for a totem bearer.

814
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:48,227
That makes two of us.

815
00:39:52,497 --> 00:39:54,333
Nora.

816
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:06,144
I'll find you. I promise.

817
00:40:06,145 --> 00:40:08,314
Go.

818
00:40:09,315 --> 00:40:10,316
Go!

819
00:40:12,918 --> 00:40:16,589
Hey!

820
00:40:17,723 --> 00:40:19,958
Performance anxiety, Raymond?

821
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,493
You're only proving my point that

822
00:40:21,494 --> 00:40:24,496
this plan was never gonna work.

823
00:40:24,497 --> 00:40:27,600
Oh, come on. Don't make me do this.

824
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:31,869
It's too bad, really.

825
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:34,940
I was just beginning to
like you after Berlin.

826
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:47,285
You literally stabbed me in the back.

827
00:40:47,286 --> 00:40:48,920
It only seemed fitting.

828
00:40:48,921 --> 00:40:50,856
You're lucky I wasn't
aiming for your heart.

829
00:40:50,857 --> 00:40:53,257
I am not gonna let Nora be taken by him.

830
00:40:53,258 --> 00:40:54,726
Nora's gone, Damien.

831
00:41:06,458 --> 00:41:10,442
Finally, I am free.

832
00:41:28,127 --> 00:41:29,627
No.

833
00:41:29,628 --> 00:41:32,330
- Nora.
- You can't help her, Ray.

834
00:41:32,331 --> 00:41:33,966
Oh, my God.

835
00:41:35,935 --> 00:41:43,009
I am so much more than a god.

836
00:41:47,527 --> 00:41:51,300
