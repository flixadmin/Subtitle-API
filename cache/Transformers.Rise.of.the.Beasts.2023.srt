1
00:00:55,422 --> 00:01:01,053
There‘s a legend that precedes
the dawn of our civilization.

2
00:01:01,054 --> 00:01:05,530
A vile god,
so large and so powerful

3
00:01:05,531 --> 00:01:09,501
that it consumed
entire planets as fuel.

4
00:01:09,502 --> 00:01:11,998
Few believed such a thing
could be true,

5
00:01:11,999 --> 00:01:17,543
until the day we saw Unicron
with our own eyes.

6
00:01:40,764 --> 00:01:43,403
But he didn‘t just come
for our planet.

7
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:46,637
He wanted
our greatest technology,

8
00:01:46,638 --> 00:01:48,936
the Transwarp Key.

9
00:01:48,937 --> 00:01:53,314
And he sent his most powerful
henchman to collect it,

10
00:01:53,315 --> 00:01:55,185
Scourge.

11
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,927
More enemies are landing.

12
00:02:45,928 --> 00:02:47,368
We won‘t be safe for long.

13
00:02:47,369 --> 00:02:48,634
Do we have the key?

14
00:02:49,998 --> 00:02:51,504
You must take it.

15
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,341
Keep it hidden,

16
00:02:53,342 --> 00:02:56,212
so that it never falls
into the hands of Unicron.

17
00:02:56,213 --> 00:02:58,940
But, Apelinq, we can fight.

18
00:02:58,941 --> 00:03:02,845
No. Protecting our Transwarp
Key is all that matters!

19
00:03:02,846 --> 00:03:04,979
Go. Use it to escape.

20
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,850
What will you do?

21
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,853
I‘ll hold him off.

22
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:11,723
Buy you some time.

23
00:03:12,427 --> 00:03:13,691
Then I‘m staying with you.

24
00:03:13,692 --> 00:03:15,825
This is my fight.

25
00:03:15,826 --> 00:03:19,994
Listen, if Unicron
were to get the key,

26
00:03:19,995 --> 00:03:22,337
he could open a portal
through time and space

27
00:03:22,338 --> 00:03:25,197
with no end to the worlds
he could destroy.

28
00:03:25,198 --> 00:03:29,102
It is now your time
to lead the Maximals,

29
00:03:29,103 --> 00:03:31,204
Optimus Primal.

30
00:03:53,336 --> 00:03:57,571
So you‘re
this planet‘s great warrior.

31
00:03:59,034 --> 00:04:04,380
Mmm. You have
such a beautiful world

32
00:04:06,206 --> 00:04:09,913
filled with
an abundance of life.

33
00:04:11,178 --> 00:04:14,291
Savory.

34
00:04:15,721 --> 00:04:17,920
My master grows hungry.

35
00:04:17,921 --> 00:04:23,860
Give me the Transwarp Key,
and he will spare your home.

36
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:27,402
We‘d rather die than let
him reach other planets.

37
00:04:27,403 --> 00:04:30,901
So be it.

38
00:04:46,785 --> 00:04:50,492
Benefits of serving
the almighty Unicron.

39
00:04:53,825 --> 00:04:56,256
They never learn.

40
00:04:59,226 --> 00:05:02,966
Your master will be trapped
in this galaxy forever.

41
00:05:07,905 --> 00:05:09,643
No!

42
00:05:15,209 --> 00:05:17,618
His sacrifice will be our oath.

43
00:05:18,355 --> 00:05:19,818
To preserve the key,

44
00:05:20,489 --> 00:05:22,282
no matter the cost.

45
00:05:30,994 --> 00:05:36,405
You let them slip away
with the Transwarp Key.

46
00:05:36,406 --> 00:05:40,937
Scour the universe and find
where the Maximals have gone.

47
00:05:40,938 --> 00:05:45,810
When you acquire the key,
use it to bring me to you.

48
00:05:45,811 --> 00:05:48,076
Yes, my lord.

49
00:05:48,077 --> 00:05:54,182
Once I have the key,
I alone will reign supreme.

50
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:56,683
All right, baby, come on.

51
00:06:56,684 --> 00:06:58,312
Show me the money.
Show me the money.

52
00:07:01,524 --> 00:07:05,087
Here we go. There we go.

53
00:07:05,088 --> 00:07:07,420
Yo, Sonic. Breakfast ready yet?

54
00:07:08,993 --> 00:07:10,697
I ain‘t your butler, Kris.

55
00:07:10,698 --> 00:07:13,425
Come on, man.
No names over the airwaves.

56
00:07:13,426 --> 00:07:14,702
It‘s Tails.

57
00:07:15,571 --> 00:07:16,901
Oh, my bad,

58
00:07:16,902 --> 00:07:20,069
Kristopher Diaz
from 974 Wilson Avenue,

59
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,906
Apartment 2-C, Brooklyn.

60
00:07:21,907 --> 00:07:24,205
No real names.
They‘re listening.

61
00:07:24,206 --> 00:07:27,615
Ain‘t no secret government
agencies worried about us, Tails.

62
00:07:27,616 --> 00:07:29,716
Now get your behind out here
while it‘s hot.

63
00:07:29,717 --> 00:07:32,752
At least they got that going for ‘em.
Here, I ironed this for you.

64
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:35,348
I already ironed it. What...
Like you cooked those eggs?

65
00:07:35,349 --> 00:07:37,956
What you mean?
They‘re just... seasoned.

66
00:07:40,255 --> 00:07:41,564
Come eat, bro.

67
00:07:42,224 --> 00:07:44,192
I can‘t get past Bowser.

68
00:07:44,193 --> 00:07:45,666
Well, good morning to you too.

69
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:47,569
Drink this
and take your medicine.

70
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,703
All of it.
Okay.

71
00:07:49,704 --> 00:07:51,232
Are you sure you can take him?

72
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:53,938
Yeah, uh, hospital‘s
on the way. I got time.

73
00:07:53,939 --> 00:07:56,809
And, if that lady,
that administrator, is there

74
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,338
and she mentions a bill,

75
00:07:58,339 --> 00:07:59,439
just...

76
00:08:00,341 --> 00:08:02,782
tell her we‘re handling it.

77
00:08:02,783 --> 00:08:05,588
I will. And after today,
I‘ll be able to help out more.

78
00:08:06,622 --> 00:08:08,150
Good luck on the interview.

79
00:08:08,151 --> 00:08:10,790
Don‘t forget to laugh
at all their jokes.

80
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,892
White people love that shit.
Ma, language.

81
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:17,489
Okay! [kisses] Remember, I have
class tonight, so I‘ll be home late.

82
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,161
Los quiero.
I love you.

83
00:08:19,162 --> 00:08:21,703
Hurry up, man.
We gotta get into the city.

84
00:08:26,433 --> 00:08:27,642
Hey. Hold up. Hold up.

85
00:08:27,643 --> 00:08:29,337
Your hand‘s hurting again?

86
00:08:30,272 --> 00:08:32,010
No, it‘s nothing.

87
00:08:32,681 --> 00:08:34,012
Yo, let me see.

88
00:08:36,377 --> 00:08:37,851
Kris.

89
00:08:41,624 --> 00:08:43,317
It‘s swollen.

90
00:08:43,318 --> 00:08:46,221
The sickle cells must be
blocking the blood flow again.

91
00:08:46,222 --> 00:08:47,794
How long has this been going on?

92
00:08:47,795 --> 00:08:49,324
Couple days.

93
00:08:50,358 --> 00:08:52,194
Hey, yo, look, I told you,

94
00:08:52,195 --> 00:08:53,833
you gotta tell me these things.

95
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:56,529
You fighting this alone,
or we fighting it together?

96
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,070
Together.

97
00:09:00,104 --> 00:09:01,907
Home team?

98
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,107
Home team.

99
00:09:10,048 --> 00:09:12,720
Two for ten. Two for...
Stop touching everything.

100
00:09:12,721 --> 00:09:14,788
Oh, hell, no.
Kris, what‘d I tell you

101
00:09:14,789 --> 00:09:17,857
about letting your mans come out the
crib looking like a whole square?

102
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:19,859
Only so much I can do.

103
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,729
Yeah, whatever, bro.
Look. Here.

104
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,292
Ooh! My dawg!

105
00:09:24,293 --> 00:09:27,900
When you gonna let me put your skills
to work and get you some real money?

106
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,133
Yeah. Says the dude
who can‘t even afford cable.

107
00:09:30,134 --> 00:09:31,607
"Says the guy who..."

108
00:09:31,608 --> 00:09:33,565
I choose not to purchase cable.

109
00:09:33,566 --> 00:09:36,337
It‘s my own personal way
to protest the vampiric nature

110
00:09:36,338 --> 00:09:38,306
of modern-day capitalism!

111
00:09:38,307 --> 00:09:40,749
Hey, good luck with that
interview in that dusty suit!

112
00:10:04,267 --> 00:10:06,070
Ugh! I‘m coming.

113
00:10:06,071 --> 00:10:07,676
Hey, guys. That‘s a good one,

114
00:10:07,677 --> 00:10:09,745
but the Ankylosaurus
was an armored dinosaur.

115
00:10:19,546 --> 00:10:24,055
Where I am weak, baby
♪

116
00:10:24,056 --> 00:10:26,761
Thank you, thank you...
for being patient.

117
00:10:26,762 --> 00:10:28,356
Intern? Intern?

118
00:10:28,357 --> 00:10:31,128
I paged you three times.
Why didn‘t you call me?

119
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:34,296
Okay, well, I figured if I stopped
to call, that would make me later.

120
00:10:34,297 --> 00:10:36,738
The police are here.

121
00:10:36,739 --> 00:10:38,597
They busted an art auction.

122
00:10:38,598 --> 00:10:41,303
The owner claims
that everything is authentic,

123
00:10:41,304 --> 00:10:43,878
but they want a second opinion.

124
00:10:45,242 --> 00:10:46,342
All right.

125
00:10:49,642 --> 00:10:51,643
The da Vinci sketch is legit.

126
00:10:51,644 --> 00:10:53,282
The painting‘s a copy.

127
00:10:53,283 --> 00:10:55,351
Real one‘s at the National
Gallery in London.

128
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:58,584
Roman vase.

129
00:10:58,585 --> 00:11:02,127
Valuable, but you are not
gonna retire off of them.

130
00:11:04,767 --> 00:11:07,263
This Greek curse tablet,
it would be expensive,

131
00:11:07,264 --> 00:11:08,528
but it‘s a fake.

132
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:10,101
How can you tell?

133
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:12,708
See the spelling? Roman.

134
00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:14,435
Doesn‘t even show up
in that era.

135
00:11:14,436 --> 00:11:16,140
Got it.

136
00:11:16,141 --> 00:11:19,781
Officers,
I figured it out. So...

137
00:11:19,782 --> 00:11:23,544
The da Vinci, that is real.

138
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,654
Hmm.
Now, where did you come from?

139
00:11:49,174 --> 00:11:50,878
What are you?

140
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:53,507
It‘s pretty neat, right?
Yes.

141
00:11:53,508 --> 00:11:55,674
Where is it from?

142
00:11:55,675 --> 00:11:57,544
They just discovered it
in Sudan.

143
00:11:57,545 --> 00:12:01,515
The boys say it‘s Horus,
fifth millennia BC, Nubian?

144
00:12:01,516 --> 00:12:04,683
This symbol is definitely
not hieroglyphic.

145
00:12:04,684 --> 00:12:07,389
Well, if it‘s as exotic
as it looks,

146
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,359
I‘m gonna get a feature Minerva.

147
00:12:09,997 --> 00:12:12,131
Uh, Jillian?

148
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:16,333
Okay, team, let‘s do it.

149
00:12:34,681 --> 00:12:35,957
Okay, what are the rules?

150
00:12:37,321 --> 00:12:38,960
Bros before hos.

151
00:12:41,864 --> 00:12:43,095
"Don‘t be a problem.

152
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,624
Don‘t go looking
for a problem."

153
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,758
Or else we‘re gonna...
Have a problem.

154
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:48,067
I know, I know.

155
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:49,630
Okay, I‘ll be back
in a little bit.

156
00:12:56,505 --> 00:12:58,144
Mr. Diaz?

157
00:12:59,607 --> 00:13:01,949
Hey, I know we‘re
a little behind on the bill.

158
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:05,051
Three months behind. Until your account
is current, you can‘t bring your brother.

159
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:06,712
I‘ve told you that.
I‘m gonna fix it.

160
00:13:06,713 --> 00:13:09,220
I need a little more time.
Take him to the ER.

161
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:11,783
Well, they won‘t see him in
the ER unless he‘s critical.

162
00:13:11,784 --> 00:13:13,390
Mr. Diaz.
He‘s 11!

163
00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:16,162
He‘s 11 years old.

164
00:13:18,758 --> 00:13:21,562
Come on, Kris, we gotta go.

165
00:13:21,563 --> 00:13:24,730
What happened? I‘ll tell you later, man.
All right?

166
00:13:24,731 --> 00:13:26,271
Come on.
Let‘s get out of here.

167
00:13:29,703 --> 00:13:30,803
Hey, yo. Sit here.

168
00:13:33,113 --> 00:13:35,477
And don‘t move!

169
00:13:35,478 --> 00:13:38,480
After a conference with Simpson‘s
attorney, Howard Weitzman...

170
00:13:38,481 --> 00:13:40,614
Can I help you?
Yes.

171
00:13:40,615 --> 00:13:42,781
Hey, I‘m here for an interview with
the head of security, Mr. Bishop.

172
00:13:42,782 --> 00:13:44,552
I‘m Noah Diaz.

173
00:13:44,553 --> 00:13:46,928
It‘s been canceled. No. No,
that has to be a mistake.

174
00:13:46,929 --> 00:13:48,788
Came right from Mr. Bishop.

175
00:13:50,757 --> 00:13:52,824
Just need your authorization...

176
00:13:52,825 --> 00:13:54,661
Mr. Bishop! Hey! Hey!

177
00:13:54,662 --> 00:13:57,169
It‘s okay, Walker.

178
00:13:57,170 --> 00:14:00,403
It‘s me, Noah Diaz. Sir, I think
your boy back there is confused.

179
00:14:00,404 --> 00:14:02,768
He said our interview was canceled.
Because it is.

180
00:14:02,769 --> 00:14:05,441
Wait, why? On the phone you
said I was perfect for the job.

181
00:14:05,442 --> 00:14:07,179
You said this
was just a formality.

182
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,775
It was until your old commanding
officer called me back.

183
00:14:09,776 --> 00:14:13,284
Said you were brave, an expert
comtech, but unreliable.

184
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:14,747
Couldn‘t trust you.

185
00:14:14,748 --> 00:14:16,551
Your head was always
somewhere else.

186
00:14:16,552 --> 00:14:18,520
Sir, I can explain all of that.

187
00:14:18,521 --> 00:14:20,896
I had some responsibilities at home.
My brother, he‘s sick...

188
00:14:20,897 --> 00:14:23,294
You had a responsibility
to the United States Army.

189
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:25,395
Mr. Bishop! Sir.

190
00:14:25,396 --> 00:14:28,036
I‘m a hard worker, okay?
I just...

191
00:14:29,664 --> 00:14:31,731
I just really need a break.

192
00:14:31,732 --> 00:14:35,637
Listen, I can‘t have someone
like you mess up what I‘ve built.

193
00:14:36,242 --> 00:14:37,914
Someone like me?

194
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:45,151
You don‘t know anything
about me!

195
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:47,781
I know you don‘t know
how to be part of a team.

196
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:51,455
God.

197
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,028
Hey, look.

198
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:55,590
Superman went
on a bunch of interviews

199
00:14:55,591 --> 00:14:58,659
before he got his job
Daily Planet.

200
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,497
But he never gave up.
I‘m not Superman, Kris.

201
00:15:01,498 --> 00:15:03,004
Life ain‘t a comic book.

202
00:15:03,005 --> 00:15:05,369
I‘m just saying.
You‘ll get the next one.

203
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:07,536
Yo, there is no next one.

204
00:15:07,537 --> 00:15:10,012
No one‘s coming to save us.
We‘re alone in this.

205
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,352
Yo, man, I‘m sorry.

206
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,386
It‘s all right.

207
00:15:22,387 --> 00:15:23,685
No, it‘s not.

208
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,690
None of this is.

209
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:37,567
You know what?

210
00:15:38,469 --> 00:15:39,602
Come on.

211
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:43,902
Yo, here, bro.

212
00:15:43,903 --> 00:15:46,543
Just head upstairs. I‘ll
be right there, all right?

213
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,252
So what was you
talking about earlier?

214
00:16:13,075 --> 00:16:14,306
Hey, yo, you want one?

215
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,605
No. I don‘t want any candy.

216
00:16:16,606 --> 00:16:18,508
You gotta relax, man.

217
00:16:18,509 --> 00:16:20,609
Your energy
is really affecting my chi.

218
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:23,150
And I get it. I was
nervous my first time too.

219
00:16:23,151 --> 00:16:26,111
But you might want to do some breathing
exercises, or something. Look at me.

220
00:16:32,523 --> 00:16:34,294
My man, my man, my man, my man.

221
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:37,923
It‘s just
I ain‘t done this before.

222
00:16:37,924 --> 00:16:40,662
I know that.
But them rich cats in there,

223
00:16:40,663 --> 00:16:42,763
they give a ton of paper
to charities every year

224
00:16:42,764 --> 00:16:44,765
to make themselves feel better.

225
00:16:44,766 --> 00:16:47,736
If you look at it from a holistic
perspective, we doing them a favor.

226
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:52,003
Hey, yo! You‘re welcome!
Will you stop?

227
00:16:52,004 --> 00:16:55,545
What are you doing? This ain‘t
about to affect they pockets at all.

228
00:16:55,546 --> 00:16:57,283
And it‘s about
to be easy as hell.

229
00:16:57,284 --> 00:16:59,747
So why you ain‘t the one
going in there and doing it?

230
00:16:59,748 --> 00:17:02,222
Papito, I‘m the mastermind.

231
00:17:02,223 --> 00:17:05,126
Now come on,
put this in your ear.

232
00:17:05,127 --> 00:17:07,854
My man, you serious?
Yo, is that even clean?

233
00:17:07,855 --> 00:17:11,528
It‘s the fourth quarter, we got
about ten seconds left on the clock,

234
00:17:11,529 --> 00:17:13,267
and you got the rock.

235
00:17:13,993 --> 00:17:15,467
Get rid of this.
Hey, man!

236
00:17:16,732 --> 00:17:19,075
Don‘t slam the...

237
00:17:24,509 --> 00:17:27,610
Okay. I am off
to my fundraiser.

238
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:29,975
What do you think?
It‘s nice.

239
00:17:29,976 --> 00:17:33,782
Um, can I...
Can I run something by you?

240
00:17:37,049 --> 00:17:38,984
So I‘ve been doing
some research,

241
00:17:38,985 --> 00:17:42,196
and I don‘t think
that the statuette is Horus.

242
00:17:42,197 --> 00:17:44,330
As a matter of fact,
I‘m sure it‘s not.

243
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:47,058
The boys dated it
around 5000 BC, right?

244
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:48,664
Mm-hmm.

245
00:17:48,665 --> 00:17:50,138
But the Nubians,

246
00:17:50,139 --> 00:17:51,865
they never even had contact
with the Egyptians

247
00:17:51,866 --> 00:17:53,768
until 600 years after that.

248
00:17:53,769 --> 00:17:55,638
The symbol‘s not hieroglyphic.

249
00:17:55,639 --> 00:17:57,541
I don‘t even think it‘s
from that part of the world.

250
00:17:57,542 --> 00:17:59,775
I think it might
be Aztec or Inca.

251
00:18:01,579 --> 00:18:04,516
It‘s not some Egyptian god.
It‘s something else.

252
00:18:09,818 --> 00:18:11,489
Interesting.

253
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,788
Get those pressed, okay?

254
00:18:35,107 --> 00:18:37,009
Yeah.

255
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:40,584
There you go.
Let that breath fill you up.

256
00:18:40,585 --> 00:18:43,389
In... out.

257
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,457
Please stop talking.

258
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,119
Okay, all right, I get it, you don‘t
like to chitchat back and forth.

259
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,462
But I got something for you.

260
00:18:53,697 --> 00:18:55,698
You got a robbing mixtape?

261
00:18:55,699 --> 00:18:56,765
Uh, no.

262
00:18:56,766 --> 00:18:59,274
I got a liberating mixtape.

263
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:13,617
You feeling that, huh?

264
00:19:13,618 --> 00:19:14,718
Yeah, whatever.

265
00:19:20,988 --> 00:19:24,331
All right, there shouldn‘t be
nobody in this part of the building.

266
00:19:24,332 --> 00:19:26,466
You should be able
to just waltz right on in.

267
00:19:30,569 --> 00:19:32,768
Strike one, mastermind.
This place is packed.

268
00:19:32,769 --> 00:19:35,067
Hey, well, to error is divine.

269
00:19:35,068 --> 00:19:36,937
Just act like you own the place.

270
00:19:36,938 --> 00:19:39,577
Hey, wassup, brother?
Good to see you again.

271
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:42,141
Try not to look suspicious.

272
00:19:44,418 --> 00:19:47,618
Here you go. Here you go.
Sorry. Sorry. That‘s you, bro.

273
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:50,456
Nice glasses. I didn‘t know...
I didn‘t know you had glasses.

274
00:19:50,457 --> 00:19:52,558
What are you doing,
making friends?

275
00:20:00,962 --> 00:20:03,272
Everything good?
We‘re in the mix.

276
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:10,872
Hey. Let‘s see
what you really are.

277
00:20:21,213 --> 00:20:23,555
Now, my man said
it‘s tucked in the back.

278
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,184
Been there a couple weeks.

279
00:20:26,218 --> 00:20:27,988
It‘s like a grayish car

280
00:20:27,989 --> 00:20:29,297
with like a...

281
00:20:29,298 --> 00:20:31,024
Blue stripe.

282
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:49,141
All right, now just
like brother Reek showed you.

283
00:20:49,142 --> 00:20:50,352
Down the window...

284
00:20:51,848 --> 00:20:53,046
a little wiggle...

285
00:20:53,047 --> 00:20:55,885
feel that snag and...

286
00:20:57,392 --> 00:20:58,557
yeah.

287
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:00,296
Now we making money.

288
00:21:25,354 --> 00:21:26,882
All right.
Talk to me, homey.

289
00:21:26,883 --> 00:21:28,015
I‘m in.

290
00:21:28,016 --> 00:21:29,281
This won‘t hurt a bit.

291
00:21:44,901 --> 00:21:47,134
Stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop.

292
00:21:50,544 --> 00:21:52,876
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

293
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:01,049
I‘m gonna lose my job.

294
00:22:03,117 --> 00:22:05,317
I‘m gonna go to jail.

295
00:22:21,806 --> 00:22:24,072
It‘s definitely not Nubian.

296
00:23:01,846 --> 00:23:04,144
This cannot be.

297
00:23:04,145 --> 00:23:07,180
Calling all Autobots!
Calling all Autobots!

298
00:23:07,181 --> 00:23:08,853
Yippee-ki-yay, mother...

299
00:23:15,222 --> 00:23:17,861
Prime, this is Arcee.
I have a visual.

300
00:23:17,862 --> 00:23:19,226
What am I looking at?

301
00:23:20,601 --> 00:23:22,130
A way home.

302
00:23:27,003 --> 00:23:28,971
Calling all Autobots!

303
00:23:28,972 --> 00:23:31,139
Calling all Autobots!

304
00:23:35,451 --> 00:23:38,079
What am I doing? Well, the
coast is clear out here,

305
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,752
so whenever you want to slide
that thing on out, you good.

306
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,490
I can‘t. I can‘t.

307
00:23:42,491 --> 00:23:44,591
Like you can‘t
drive stick or something?

308
00:23:44,592 --> 00:23:47,220
No, it‘s just...
I ain‘t no thief.

309
00:23:47,221 --> 00:23:49,420
Are you having
an existential crisis now?

310
00:23:49,421 --> 00:23:51,532
The deadline for that was
when I offered you Twizzlers.

311
00:23:51,533 --> 00:23:53,424
This is an emergency.

312
00:23:53,425 --> 00:23:55,393
Can you hear me, Mirage?
Roll out!

313
00:23:55,394 --> 00:23:57,263
Who the hell was that?

314
00:23:57,264 --> 00:23:59,607
That‘s the radio, bro.
This car is buggin‘. I‘m out.

315
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:02,808
Hey!

316
00:24:03,545 --> 00:24:04,611
Shit!

317
00:24:04,612 --> 00:24:06,713
Oh, shit.
Hey, you!

318
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,914
Get out of the car!

319
00:24:10,915 --> 00:24:14,016
I‘m trying! The car started
by itself, I promise!

320
00:24:14,017 --> 00:24:15,722
Look, it‘s not working!
Get out now!

321
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:26,391
No! Wait! What you doing?

322
00:24:26,392 --> 00:24:27,668
Noah, what‘s...

323
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:33,365
Reek! Reek! Reek!

324
00:24:33,366 --> 00:24:35,236
Now, that‘s top-tier
manifestation!

325
00:24:36,468 --> 00:24:38,371
Yo, the car‘s driving by itself!

326
00:24:40,472 --> 00:24:41,780
Noah, you good?

327
00:24:41,781 --> 00:24:43,144
I don‘t know what‘s going on!

328
00:24:43,145 --> 00:24:44,618
It won‘t stop!

329
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:46,950
Yo, stop! Stop!
Why aren‘t you listening?

330
00:24:46,951 --> 00:24:49,414
You might wanna slow down.
It‘s not me, it‘s the car!

331
00:24:49,415 --> 00:24:51,086
It‘s possessed!
No, no, no.

332
00:24:51,087 --> 00:24:52,824
You‘re just
on an adrenaline high.

333
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,794
Let‘s do some of them
breathing exercises.

334
00:24:56,224 --> 00:24:58,027
Yo, I don‘t need
no breathing exercises!

335
00:24:58,028 --> 00:24:59,425
The car‘s driving by itself!

336
00:25:00,998 --> 00:25:02,867
Oh, snap.

337
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:04,803
Yo, Reek, what do we do?

338
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:06,805
Noah, I cannot hear you.

339
00:25:06,806 --> 00:25:08,500
Reek!
Noah, I can‘t...

340
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:13,846
No, he did not!
No, he did not just leave me!

341
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:18,477
Pull over!
Help me!

342
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:53,281
Oh! Are you ok...

343
00:26:00,156 --> 00:26:02,730
Drive. Drive, drive,
drive, drive, drive!

344
00:26:16,238 --> 00:26:18,613
The bridge.
The bridge, the bridge...

345
00:26:18,614 --> 00:26:19,879
Take the Williamsburg!

346
00:26:28,547 --> 00:26:31,352
I got a 10-37 in progress.
Silver Porsche.

347
00:26:33,728 --> 00:26:35,191
You serious, man?

348
00:26:40,064 --> 00:26:42,803
Oh, nah. Oh, nah.

349
00:26:50,745 --> 00:26:52,439
Hell, do something, please!

350
00:27:05,254 --> 00:27:08,829
Yo, nah. Nah, nah, nah.

351
00:27:14,934 --> 00:27:16,396
Come in, come in.

352
00:27:16,397 --> 00:27:18,432
Can you hear me, Mirage?
Mir-what?

353
00:27:30,719 --> 00:27:33,446
Oh, Mirage.

354
00:27:54,435 --> 00:27:56,778
Yo, yo, yo, slow down!
Slow down!

355
00:28:07,987 --> 00:28:11,825
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
That felt good!

356
00:28:11,826 --> 00:28:15,521
Get some oil pumping,
you know? Damn!

357
00:28:15,522 --> 00:28:17,259
I‘ve been cooped up
forever, dude.

358
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,294
I can‘t tell you
how old it gets!

359
00:28:19,295 --> 00:28:21,296
"Mirage, stay hidden.

360
00:28:21,297 --> 00:28:24,464
Mirage, don‘t draw
any attention to yourself.

361
00:28:24,465 --> 00:28:29,469
Is just a movie.
You‘ll never be a real boy."

362
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:32,208
But that was fun, man.
You‘re fun, dude.

363
00:28:32,209 --> 00:28:35,817
Oh, right. This is probably
a lot for you, huh?

364
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:40,920
Back up! Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What‘s with the aggression?

365
00:28:40,921 --> 00:28:43,021
I thought after the car
chase, we were boys.

366
00:28:43,022 --> 00:28:45,353
Are you gonna hit me?
Maybe.

367
00:28:45,354 --> 00:28:48,654
It‘s like that?

368
00:28:51,558 --> 00:28:53,724
Hmm. Tough guy.

369
00:28:53,725 --> 00:28:56,562
I like that.
I like it a lot.

370
00:28:56,563 --> 00:28:58,333
What are you?

371
00:28:58,334 --> 00:29:00,368
Some sort of possessed car
or something?

372
00:29:00,369 --> 00:29:02,876
Nah.
That‘s not real, man.

373
00:29:02,877 --> 00:29:03,976
I‘m an alien.

374
00:29:03,977 --> 00:29:06,011
Like... Like E.T.?

375
00:29:06,012 --> 00:29:08,409
E.T.? The little ugly guy
in the basket?

376
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:11,083
Look at this face!
The name‘s Mirage.

377
00:29:13,448 --> 00:29:15,449
Come on. Give me a little,
give me a little.

378
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:17,088
Give me a little.
Give a little tap.

379
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:18,419
Give me a little tap.

380
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,421
There you go.
Now we‘re friends!

381
00:29:20,422 --> 00:29:23,424
Oh, great. The gang‘s here.

382
00:29:23,425 --> 00:29:26,526
There are more like you?
Like me? Nah.

383
00:29:26,527 --> 00:29:28,231
But be cool
so they don‘t crush you.

384
00:29:28,232 --> 00:29:30,663
What? Yeah, I‘d put that
pipe down if I were you.

385
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:02,695
Well, well,
who have we got here?

386
00:30:07,106 --> 00:30:08,800
Mirage, what have you done?

387
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:12,176
You brought a human here?

388
00:30:12,177 --> 00:30:14,849
Optimus!
Hey! Looking good, man!

389
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,444
Wait a second.
Are those new rims?

390
00:30:16,445 --> 00:30:18,578
You were told to stay hidden.

391
00:30:18,579 --> 00:30:20,855
Right, right.
Crazy coincidence.

392
00:30:20,856 --> 00:30:22,956
When you called,
all Optimus-like...

393
00:30:22,957 --> 00:30:25,156
"Autobots, roll out!"...

394
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:27,026
this guy
was already in the car.

395
00:30:27,027 --> 00:30:29,259
But he‘s cool,
so it‘s cool. Cool?

396
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,822
Not cool.

397
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,167
Who are you, human?

398
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:38,235
I‘m nobody.
I ain‘t even seen nothing.

399
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:40,105
I‘m not even seeing
anything right now.

400
00:30:40,106 --> 00:30:41,800
Arcee.

401
00:30:45,342 --> 00:30:47,574
Private Noah Diaz, US Army.

402
00:30:47,575 --> 00:30:50,544
Multiple commendations.
A wizard with electronics.

403
00:30:50,545 --> 00:30:52,414
Huh. He‘s a soldier.

404
00:30:52,415 --> 00:30:54,922
He does not look like a soldier.

405
00:30:54,923 --> 00:30:59,025
I mean, you looking
pretty rough yourself.

406
00:30:59,026 --> 00:31:00,785
Sorry, sir.

407
00:31:00,786 --> 00:31:03,690
I will deal
with your mistake later.

408
00:31:06,363 --> 00:31:10,795
Okay, the energy surge we felt
was in the 4,000 yottahertz range,

409
00:31:10,796 --> 00:31:12,764
which is undetectable to humans.

410
00:31:12,765 --> 00:31:16,009
I‘ve reconstructed the source
from the energy echoes.

411
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:19,573
I cannot believe it.
It exists and it is here.

412
00:31:19,574 --> 00:31:21,575
What the hell am I looking at?

413
00:31:21,576 --> 00:31:23,214
The Transwarp Key.

414
00:31:23,215 --> 00:31:26,283
It was thought to be lost
thousands of years ago.

415
00:31:26,284 --> 00:31:30,551
It was once used
to open space-time portals

416
00:31:30,552 --> 00:31:34,060
to Energon-rich planets
throughout the universe.

417
00:31:34,061 --> 00:31:36,392
You mean Energon-rich
planets like...

418
00:31:36,393 --> 00:31:37,998
Cybertron.

419
00:31:37,999 --> 00:31:40,935
After seven long years
stranded on Earth,

420
00:31:40,936 --> 00:31:43,036
we‘ve finally found a way home.

421
00:31:43,037 --> 00:31:44,972
Wait till I catch you, Reek.

422
00:31:44,973 --> 00:31:48,206
Okay, so where
is this t-tran, t-trun...

423
00:31:48,207 --> 00:31:49,603
Transwarp Key?
Thank you.

424
00:31:49,604 --> 00:31:51,473
It‘s in the new museum
on Ellis Island.

425
00:31:51,474 --> 00:31:54,641
Let‘s blow it up
and get the hell out of Dodge!

426
00:31:54,642 --> 00:31:57,809
No, we can‘t just go in
blasting and steal it, Bee.

427
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:59,514
The humans will hunt us down.

428
00:31:59,515 --> 00:32:02,089
What we need is a quiet way in.

429
00:32:07,523 --> 00:32:09,029
Ooh, how about him?

430
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:11,262
No.
What? Come on, man.

431
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,858
He could slip in right through
one of them little doors,

432
00:32:13,859 --> 00:32:16,498
grab the key, leave a
nice IOU and peace out.

433
00:32:16,499 --> 00:32:19,105
He‘s perfect.
What?

434
00:32:19,106 --> 00:32:21,569
No, it is a bad idea.

435
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,703
I agree with Big Man.

436
00:32:23,704 --> 00:32:26,838
So, it‘s been real, y‘all.
But...

437
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:28,774
Uh, time-out.
Mirage.

438
00:32:28,775 --> 00:32:31,810
I know. I know. Just relax. Let
me just talk to my guy real quick.

439
00:32:31,811 --> 00:32:35,385
Yo, don‘t leave me with these
tight-asses, bro. We make a great team.

440
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:37,321
This is a waste of time.

441
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:39,994
Look, I‘m not breaking into a
museum for some space robots.

442
00:32:39,995 --> 00:32:42,030
But what about for friendship?

443
00:32:43,064 --> 00:32:45,461
Uh, uh... Or, or, or

444
00:32:45,462 --> 00:32:47,892
what about for cash?

445
00:32:47,893 --> 00:32:51,830
Uh-huh. You help us get this key,
so we can get off this rock...

446
00:32:51,831 --> 00:32:54,173
No offense.
Love the neighborhood and all.

447
00:32:54,174 --> 00:32:56,571
And then I let you sell me.

448
00:32:56,572 --> 00:32:58,706
Lambo?

449
00:32:59,608 --> 00:33:00,608
Ferrari?

450
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:02,479
Indy?

451
00:33:03,843 --> 00:33:06,746
Look, you get paid
and then I‘ll split.

452
00:33:06,747 --> 00:33:08,814
So all I gotta do
is walk in and out?

453
00:33:08,815 --> 00:33:11,289
All you gotta do.
We‘ll take care of the rest.

454
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:14,094
Cross my spark and hope to die.

455
00:33:14,095 --> 00:33:16,493
Wow! That was corny
when I said it out loud.

456
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:21,497
What about the big man?
Optimal, or whatever.

457
00:33:21,498 --> 00:33:23,763
You let me worry about him.

458
00:33:23,764 --> 00:33:24,864
Cool?

459
00:33:26,767 --> 00:33:29,605
Ah! Got him!
He‘s in, baby! Whoo!

460
00:33:56,137 --> 00:33:58,435
Y‘all are robots
that transform into cars,

461
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,569
even though
you‘re from way out in space.

462
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:03,341
But now there‘s this key that
opens a portal back to your home?

463
00:34:03,342 --> 00:34:06,509
Oh, and you know this because
there‘s a beacon light in the sky

464
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:08,445
that I can‘t see
because I‘m human.

465
00:34:08,446 --> 00:34:11,008
You say that like it‘s weird.
It‘s super weird.

466
00:34:11,009 --> 00:34:13,879
You know what‘s weird? Marky
Mark is leaving the Funky Bunch!

467
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:17,487
I heard he‘s just gonna pursue acting now.
That‘s crazy! What?

468
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:19,390
How does that...
What a world.

469
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:20,787
Whatever, man.

470
00:34:20,788 --> 00:34:22,723
I‘m just trying
to collect this money

471
00:34:22,724 --> 00:34:25,231
and get your angry-ass boss off
of Earth before he blows a gasket.

472
00:34:25,232 --> 00:34:26,991
Don‘t take it personal.

473
00:34:26,992 --> 00:34:28,828
He just misses home.

474
00:34:28,829 --> 00:34:32,337
And I think he blames himself
for us getting stuck here.

475
00:34:32,338 --> 00:34:34,537
Earth was supposed
to be a pit stop, you know,

476
00:34:34,538 --> 00:34:38,409
a place for us to regroup
and rejoin the war back home.

477
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:41,005
Prime feels like it‘s his fault
we‘ve been stranded here,

478
00:34:41,006 --> 00:34:43,249
like he has to fix it
all on his own.

479
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:46,120
All right, team, heads up.
There‘s security up ahead.

480
00:34:46,121 --> 00:34:47,451
Nice!

481
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:48,914
This is gonna be fun, man.

482
00:34:48,915 --> 00:34:51,125
No, no, no. No, bro.
You need to switch it up.

483
00:34:51,126 --> 00:34:54,425
You need to turn into a helicopter
or a speedboat or something.

484
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:56,758
I got something
way better than that.

485
00:35:10,376 --> 00:35:11,476
Good call.

486
00:35:14,248 --> 00:35:16,414
I do not like this plan.

487
00:35:16,415 --> 00:35:19,516
Yeah, Mirage isn‘t
really known for being quiet.

488
00:35:19,517 --> 00:35:21,485
At least Mirage is one of us.

489
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:24,015
We should not be relying
on a human.

490
00:35:24,016 --> 00:35:25,324
They are my friends.

491
00:35:25,325 --> 00:35:27,590
I know one was good to you, Bee,

492
00:35:27,591 --> 00:35:29,493
but this is not our world.

493
00:35:29,494 --> 00:35:32,463
The humans will always
protect what is theirs.

494
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:35,433
We can only trust our own kind.

495
00:35:35,434 --> 00:35:37,765
You can‘t handle the truth!

496
00:35:37,766 --> 00:35:41,440
I do not want you going
to that drive-in theater anymore.

497
00:36:26,749 --> 00:36:29,257
Nightbird, search the island.

498
00:36:30,291 --> 00:36:34,658
Finally, the hunt
draws to a close.

499
00:37:01,289 --> 00:37:02,389
Hello?

500
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:20,868
Fudge.

501
00:37:20,869 --> 00:37:21,969
Oh.

502
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:23,839
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

503
00:37:27,975 --> 00:37:29,382
Hey, are you okay?
Back up!

504
00:37:29,383 --> 00:37:31,417
Yo, are you okay?
Back up! Back up! Back up!

505
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:33,046
I didn‘t think anyone
was in here.

506
00:37:36,247 --> 00:37:37,490
That‘s it.

507
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:43,396
Who are you? Hmm?

508
00:37:43,397 --> 00:37:44,761
I‘m, uh...

509
00:37:45,432 --> 00:37:46,565
the janitor.

510
00:37:48,127 --> 00:37:50,337
Security!

511
00:37:50,338 --> 00:37:53,197
No, no, no! You don‘t have to do that!
It‘s not what it looks like.

512
00:37:53,198 --> 00:37:56,266
It looks like you‘re trying
to steal museum property.

513
00:37:56,267 --> 00:37:58,170
Okay, it‘s a little
what it looks like.

514
00:37:59,446 --> 00:38:01,414
Oh, shit.

515
00:38:01,415 --> 00:38:04,549
Hey, hey! Hey, hey, yo, yo! It
doesn‘t belong to you anyway.

516
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:07,618
No, no, no!
Just stop! Just...

517
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,490
Hey, hey! Relax, relax,
and let me explain.

518
00:38:12,217 --> 00:38:13,427
It belongs to...

519
00:38:15,561 --> 00:38:16,925
to these...

520
00:38:18,861 --> 00:38:23,503
these giant robots from space.

521
00:38:24,097 --> 00:38:25,405
Really?

522
00:38:25,406 --> 00:38:26,935
Look, I‘m gonna need that.

523
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:30,410
Damn!

524
00:38:30,411 --> 00:38:32,269
Damn!
Hey!

525
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:34,810
Hey, hey, hey! What‘s going on here?
Don‘t move.

526
00:38:34,811 --> 00:38:37,143
Man, it‘s about time
you showed up!

527
00:38:44,051 --> 00:38:45,558
The key.

528
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:12,452
You were telling the truth.
Yeah.

529
00:39:12,453 --> 00:39:14,752
But those ones aren‘t with me.

530
00:39:18,525 --> 00:39:25,433
Rip the flesh from their bones
and bring me the key.

531
00:39:30,328 --> 00:39:31,439
It‘s yours.

532
00:39:42,142 --> 00:39:43,880
Guys, we got company!

533
00:39:51,316 --> 00:39:54,022
Autobots, protect the key!

534
00:39:56,189 --> 00:39:57,289
Catch!

535
00:40:07,706 --> 00:40:09,807
Not so fast!

536
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:17,650
Oh, they‘re flying now?
Who the hell are these guys?

537
00:40:27,594 --> 00:40:29,958
Impossible!

538
00:40:29,959 --> 00:40:32,862
I enjoy that look of confusion

539
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:36,966
when an inferior being
meets a higher power.

540
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,714
What the hell are those things?

541
00:40:49,682 --> 00:40:50,980
Are you okay?

542
00:40:54,214 --> 00:40:57,117
Hey! Stop following me!
I‘m not following you!

543
00:40:57,118 --> 00:40:59,153
I‘m just escaping
in the same direction.

544
00:42:13,458 --> 00:42:14,635
Um...

545
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:19,805
Run!

546
00:42:20,498 --> 00:42:22,335
Go, go!

547
00:42:34,281 --> 00:42:36,118
Go, go, go, go, go!

548
00:42:44,027 --> 00:42:45,061
Watch out!

549
00:42:46,491 --> 00:42:48,031
Thanks.

550
00:42:54,532 --> 00:42:57,106
Scourge, I have eyes on the key.

551
00:42:58,811 --> 00:43:01,307
Prime, I don‘t think
we can hold these guys...

552
00:43:01,308 --> 00:43:03,243
Oh, no!

553
00:43:03,244 --> 00:43:04,652
My God! Put me down!

554
00:43:07,347 --> 00:43:10,052
Whoa, that was so scary.

555
00:43:10,053 --> 00:43:12,055
Oh, cool.
You‘re still alive.

556
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:15,630
Get the key!

557
00:43:17,093 --> 00:43:18,391
Noah, get out of here!

558
00:43:19,524 --> 00:43:21,933
Get off me! I hate spiders!

559
00:43:24,133 --> 00:43:27,169
Go, go, go! Don‘t die, don‘t
die, don‘t die, don‘t die!

560
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,812
Go! Get out of here!

561
00:43:39,115 --> 00:43:42,315
Uh-uh-uh.
Leaving so soon?

562
00:43:42,316 --> 00:43:44,923
Yo! Look out!

563
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:50,588
The key!

564
00:43:55,802 --> 00:43:58,771
Enough of these games.
I‘ll get it myself.

565
00:43:58,772 --> 00:44:00,708
Not on my watch.

566
00:44:28,659 --> 00:44:31,738
Aw, don‘t be frightened, humans.

567
00:44:31,739 --> 00:44:35,039
This‘ll all be over soon.

568
00:44:37,976 --> 00:44:40,109
And you call yourself a Prime.

569
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:43,179
Primus would be ashamed.

570
00:44:56,654 --> 00:45:00,526
I‘m tired of little things
getting in my way.

571
00:45:01,131 --> 00:45:02,165
Bee!

572
00:45:03,936 --> 00:45:05,696
O Captain! My Captain!

573
00:45:06,202 --> 00:45:07,335
No!

574
00:45:26,354 --> 00:45:27,685
Bee.

575
00:45:33,493 --> 00:45:36,397
Now to add a Prime
to my collection.

576
00:45:48,310 --> 00:45:50,344
Maximals.

577
00:45:50,345 --> 00:45:53,413
Good.
Maybe we‘ll get a real fight.

578
00:45:53,414 --> 00:45:56,714
No. We got what we came for.

579
00:46:01,521 --> 00:46:03,655
No.

580
00:46:04,425 --> 00:46:07,934
This cannot be.

581
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:27,547
We must go now. Come with me.

582
00:46:51,769 --> 00:46:56,114
This is my fault.
It should‘ve been me.

583
00:46:57,247 --> 00:46:59,952
I‘m sorry for your loss.

584
00:46:59,953 --> 00:47:03,054
No offense, lady,
but who are you again?

585
00:47:03,055 --> 00:47:06,486
My name is Airazor.

586
00:47:06,487 --> 00:47:08,422
I am a Maximal.

587
00:47:08,423 --> 00:47:11,326
A warrior from both
your past and future.

588
00:47:11,327 --> 00:47:14,593
Oh, right. That...
That tracks. Yeah.

589
00:47:14,594 --> 00:47:18,630
We fled our home planet
on the eve of its destruction.

590
00:47:18,631 --> 00:47:22,304
We sought refuge
and hid here on Earth.

591
00:47:22,305 --> 00:47:24,669
Right. So you‘re a Maximal.
Y‘all are Autobots.

592
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:26,836
What was those things
that attacked us earlier?

593
00:47:26,837 --> 00:47:30,708
Terrorcons. Servants
of a dark, hungry god

594
00:47:30,709 --> 00:47:33,887
who feeds on entire worlds
to sustain himself.

595
00:47:33,888 --> 00:47:36,021
Unicron.

596
00:47:36,022 --> 00:47:39,717
So you‘re saying this thing
Unicron eats planets to survive?

597
00:47:39,718 --> 00:47:44,128
Yes. And he imbues
his servants, like Scourge,

598
00:47:44,129 --> 00:47:49,364
with dark energy, which
makes him all but invincible.

599
00:47:49,365 --> 00:47:52,499
He is entirely beholden
to Unicron.

600
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:56,943
Through his power,
he possesses Scourge‘s soul.

601
00:47:56,944 --> 00:47:59,804
Awaken, my dark master.

602
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:20,164
Rise.

603
00:48:20,165 --> 00:48:23,134
My hunger is killing me.

604
00:48:23,135 --> 00:48:24,531
What have you found?

605
00:48:24,532 --> 00:48:26,698
Salvation.

606
00:48:26,699 --> 00:48:31,638
The galaxy will once again be
yours to feast on, my master.

607
00:48:32,903 --> 00:48:35,641
I should‘ve gotten
the key myself.

608
00:48:35,642 --> 00:48:38,215
I should‘ve known better
than to rely on humans.

609
00:48:38,216 --> 00:48:40,811
Yo, hold up.
What, you blaming me?

610
00:48:40,812 --> 00:48:44,518
After you conveniently left out the
part about a planet-eating monster?

611
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:46,916
Because of you,
Unicron will now use the key

612
00:48:46,917 --> 00:48:49,556
to consume every planet
in the universe!

613
00:48:49,557 --> 00:48:51,657
Including my home world.

614
00:48:51,658 --> 00:48:55,332
He doesn‘t have the key.
At least not all of it.

615
00:48:59,138 --> 00:49:02,503
This is only half the key.
Please!

616
00:49:02,504 --> 00:49:06,639
The Maximals...
They must have split it.

617
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,575
Excuses!

618
00:49:08,576 --> 00:49:11,545
Complete the key, or else
you will wish you had died

619
00:49:11,546 --> 00:49:13,811
with the rest of your planet.

620
00:49:13,812 --> 00:49:17,650
We broke the key into two
pieces for safekeeping,

621
00:49:17,651 --> 00:49:20,422
then splintered
and went into hiding.

622
00:49:20,423 --> 00:49:23,623
I do not know
where the other half is.

623
00:49:23,624 --> 00:49:28,035
For all I know,
I am the last of our kind.

624
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:30,465
It‘s in Peru.

625
00:49:30,466 --> 00:49:31,961
How you know that?

626
00:49:31,962 --> 00:49:34,040
It‘s the symbols on the stone.

627
00:49:34,041 --> 00:49:36,801
They were only ever recorded in
one other place in the world.

628
00:49:36,802 --> 00:49:39,738
The Inca Temple of the Sun
in Cusco.

629
00:49:39,739 --> 00:49:43,412
It‘s one of the oldest buildings in
the western hemisphere. I‘m-I‘m...

630
00:49:43,413 --> 00:49:46,283
I‘m guessing that
that can‘t be a coincidence.

631
00:49:46,284 --> 00:49:50,155
If you can track those symbols
to Peru, so can the Terrorcons.

632
00:49:50,156 --> 00:49:51,981
We need to get there
before they do.

633
00:49:51,982 --> 00:49:57,030
And then kill Scourge and take
his piece to complete the key.

634
00:49:57,031 --> 00:49:58,658
Yo. Hold up. Hold up.

635
00:49:58,659 --> 00:50:00,792
You want to find this other key

636
00:50:00,793 --> 00:50:03,894
and deliver it to the guy
that just kicked your asses.

637
00:50:03,895 --> 00:50:06,171
The Transwarp Key
is our only way home.

638
00:50:06,172 --> 00:50:09,207
If this dude gets ahold of that
thing, it‘s game over for Earth!

639
00:50:09,208 --> 00:50:11,804
Our families, everybody!

640
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:16,511
I‘m going.

641
00:50:16,512 --> 00:50:18,480
Out of the question.

642
00:50:18,481 --> 00:50:22,187
No offense, but I‘m not
trusting my home to a guy

643
00:50:22,188 --> 00:50:23,750
who couldn‘t even protect his.

644
00:50:25,158 --> 00:50:27,984
This is my planet.
I‘m going.

645
00:50:27,985 --> 00:50:29,459
What about you?

646
00:50:32,528 --> 00:50:35,069
Me?
What is your name?

647
00:50:36,026 --> 00:50:37,136
Elena.

648
00:50:37,137 --> 00:50:38,764
Elena,

649
00:50:38,765 --> 00:50:40,965
will you lead us to this temple?

650
00:50:44,078 --> 00:50:46,376
Chance to stop
the end of the world.

651
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:48,180
Actually,

652
00:50:48,181 --> 00:50:50,612
you‘ll be saving two worlds.

653
00:50:58,015 --> 00:50:59,093
Yeah.

654
00:51:09,169 --> 00:51:11,699
Yo, is that you, Sonic?

655
00:51:14,306 --> 00:51:15,967
What are you doing up, Tails?

656
00:51:16,803 --> 00:51:18,343
I can‘t sleep.

657
00:51:28,683 --> 00:51:29,783
This too hot?

658
00:51:31,158 --> 00:51:32,851
You playing that game too much.

659
00:51:32,852 --> 00:51:35,051
Give it a rest,
so your hand can take a break.

660
00:51:35,052 --> 00:51:36,922
I‘m gonna beat it.

661
00:51:39,133 --> 00:51:40,562
My money‘s on you, bro.

662
00:51:40,563 --> 00:51:42,300
We don‘t quit.

663
00:51:42,301 --> 00:51:44,138
Come on, get some sleep,
all right?

664
00:51:51,937 --> 00:51:54,180
Yo, listen, um,

665
00:51:54,181 --> 00:51:56,479
I gotta...
I gotta head out for a while.

666
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,779
And I don‘t know
when I‘m gonna be back.

667
00:51:59,384 --> 00:52:00,451
Why?

668
00:52:02,255 --> 00:52:05,357
Oh, shit.

669
00:52:10,395 --> 00:52:11,989
What the...
No, no, no!

670
00:52:11,990 --> 00:52:14,266
No! Stop, please!
Turn off! Turn off!

671
00:52:14,267 --> 00:52:16,730
Yo, won‘t you...
I told you to sit tight.

672
00:52:16,731 --> 00:52:18,534
Stop it. I can‘t turn it off.
I‘m sorry.

673
00:52:18,535 --> 00:52:19,667
Is that a robot?

674
00:52:19,668 --> 00:52:21,603
No, no, no.
Go... Go back to bed.

675
00:52:21,604 --> 00:52:24,672
Yo, shut it off! I think your bad
hot-wiring messed up my lights.

676
00:52:24,673 --> 00:52:26,476
I got the bat.
Yo, chill. Give me that.

677
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:29,040
Did he say "bat"?
You‘re gonna wake up Ma!

678
00:52:34,452 --> 00:52:36,553
I know you‘re a robot.

679
00:52:37,818 --> 00:52:39,050
Kris?

680
00:52:46,332 --> 00:52:48,829
Yo! You scratched my paint!

681
00:52:49,929 --> 00:52:51,633
What are you doing?

682
00:52:51,634 --> 00:52:53,437
Man, they didn‘t
treat E.T. like this.

683
00:52:53,438 --> 00:52:55,032
You know this thing?
Yeah.

684
00:52:55,033 --> 00:52:57,639
We‘re just work friends.

685
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:00,642
"Work friends"?
You‘ve been inside me.

686
00:53:00,643 --> 00:53:04,481
Look, that thing I told you
I have to go do?

687
00:53:04,482 --> 00:53:05,977
It‘s for him and his crew.

688
00:53:05,978 --> 00:53:07,682
We‘re trying to stop
the end of the world.

689
00:53:07,683 --> 00:53:08,947
The world‘s ending?

690
00:53:08,948 --> 00:53:11,455
No!
Maybe. Sixty-forty.

691
00:53:11,456 --> 00:53:13,985
You know I‘m not gonna
let that happen.

692
00:53:13,986 --> 00:53:15,724
But that‘s why I have to leave.

693
00:53:19,299 --> 00:53:20,729
I‘ll go get my things.

694
00:53:21,664 --> 00:53:23,533
Tough kid.

695
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:26,129
What? No. Whoa, whoa. Hold up.
Hold up. You‘re not coming.

696
00:53:26,130 --> 00:53:30,376
Why? You need someone to watch your back.
It‘s too dangerous, Kris.

697
00:53:31,674 --> 00:53:34,413
And I need you to stay here
and take care of Mom.

698
00:53:36,679 --> 00:53:38,483
‘Cause you might not come back.

699
00:53:52,222 --> 00:53:53,795
Hey, robot.

700
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:57,402
Me? ‘Sup?

701
00:53:57,403 --> 00:54:01,164
Watch out for my brother.
Okay?

702
00:54:01,165 --> 00:54:03,199
You got it, little man.

703
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,168
Nah, I‘m serious.

704
00:54:05,169 --> 00:54:07,809
If he gets hurt,
I‘m coming after you.

705
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:12,912
Don‘t worry.
I got Noah‘s back. I promise.

706
00:54:12,913 --> 00:54:14,244
Mm-hmm.

707
00:54:16,884 --> 00:54:18,116
Home team?

708
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:22,120
Home team.

709
00:54:26,025 --> 00:54:28,092
Kid‘s got heart.

710
00:54:28,093 --> 00:54:30,128
Cojones muy grande.

711
00:54:41,106 --> 00:54:44,009
Wu-Tang is
in the building, baby!

712
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:46,451
Way to be incognito.

713
00:54:46,452 --> 00:54:49,278
Aw, come on, Prime.
Smile a little bit.

714
00:54:49,279 --> 00:54:51,456
It won‘t hurt.
Let me see that underbite.

715
00:54:51,457 --> 00:54:54,624
All right. So what kind
of jet we taking to Peru?

716
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:56,461
Or is it a plane?
Either one‘s fine.

717
00:54:56,462 --> 00:54:59,189
I just need first class, okay?
‘Cause I got long-ass legs.

718
00:54:59,190 --> 00:55:01,125
Uh, well, he is a plane.

719
00:55:01,126 --> 00:55:02,896
No. No, no. Don‘t...

720
00:55:02,897 --> 00:55:04,733
Don‘t tell me we‘re flying on...

721
00:55:04,734 --> 00:55:06,032
Oh, no.

722
00:55:24,556 --> 00:55:28,890
My lads! I am Stratosphere,
lord of the skies!

723
00:55:36,326 --> 00:55:37,899
Yeah, I‘m walking to Peru.

724
00:55:46,908 --> 00:55:48,008
Ooh.

725
00:55:49,207 --> 00:55:50,450
Oh, my gosh.

726
00:55:54,949 --> 00:55:59,282
But I think
♪

727
00:55:59,283 --> 00:56:00,855
Sorry.

728
00:56:00,856 --> 00:56:04,188
I sing when I get nervous.
It usually calms me down.

729
00:56:04,189 --> 00:56:05,662
First time flying?

730
00:56:05,663 --> 00:56:08,160
Man, this is my first time
leaving New York.

731
00:56:09,502 --> 00:56:12,032
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

732
00:56:13,033 --> 00:56:14,506
So the Bronx, huh?

733
00:56:14,507 --> 00:56:16,640
Brooklyn, all right?

734
00:56:16,641 --> 00:56:18,368
East New York all day.

735
00:56:19,204 --> 00:56:20,369
I‘m from Bushwick.

736
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:22,844
Really?
Mm-hmm.

737
00:56:22,845 --> 00:56:25,484
Um, me and my dad,
we used to go to this...

738
00:56:25,485 --> 00:56:27,915
This pizza spot down
on Knickerbocker and Greene.

739
00:56:27,916 --> 00:56:30,787
Tony‘s Pizza? Wow.

740
00:56:35,088 --> 00:56:37,529
So, uh, tell me about him,
your pops.

741
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:38,860
What... What was he like?

742
00:56:38,861 --> 00:56:42,765
He was a...
He was a cabbie for 40 years.

743
00:56:42,766 --> 00:56:45,537
Smartest guy you ever met.

744
00:56:45,538 --> 00:56:47,869
He could talk to you
about anything.

745
00:56:47,870 --> 00:56:50,542
History, science, cricket.

746
00:56:50,543 --> 00:56:52,303
Cricket?

747
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,712
And he ain‘t never
even go to college either.

748
00:56:55,713 --> 00:56:57,747
He used to always say,

749
00:56:57,748 --> 00:57:01,410
"If you keep your eyes
and your ears open,

750
00:57:01,411 --> 00:57:03,787
life will show you
everything you need to know."

751
00:57:06,218 --> 00:57:08,594
So that‘s why you said yes
to all of this.

752
00:57:09,562 --> 00:57:12,058
I figured if
he is somewhere watching,

753
00:57:12,059 --> 00:57:15,766
then seeing his daughter
do something crazy like this

754
00:57:16,569 --> 00:57:18,505
would definitely make him proud.

755
00:57:28,548 --> 00:57:31,110
You really think
this key thing‘s in Peru?

756
00:57:31,111 --> 00:57:32,551
I... I think so.

757
00:57:32,552 --> 00:57:34,147
The evidence lines up.

758
00:57:36,050 --> 00:57:39,217
Well, if it is,
and we get our hands on it,

759
00:57:39,218 --> 00:57:40,691
then we gotta destroy it.

760
00:57:40,692 --> 00:57:42,792
What?

761
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:45,927
They can‘t unite the key
without both pieces.

762
00:57:45,928 --> 00:57:49,536
No key, no Unicron,
no Earth getting eaten.

763
00:57:53,166 --> 00:57:55,201
Yeah, but then
they can‘t get home.

764
00:57:56,642 --> 00:57:58,237
We gotta think about us.

765
00:58:02,274 --> 00:58:04,473
Look, all you gotta do
is find it.

766
00:58:04,474 --> 00:58:06,377
And I‘ll take care of the rest.

767
00:58:10,689 --> 00:58:14,758
Do you think an Energon
infusion could bring him back?

768
00:58:14,759 --> 00:58:15,859
Perhaps.

769
00:58:16,827 --> 00:58:19,456
If we could get him
back to Cybertron.

770
00:58:21,227 --> 00:58:24,494
I never should have taken us
so far from home.

771
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:09,110
Wow! Wheeljack needs to fix
that power steering.

772
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:13,377
Sorry I‘m late.

773
00:59:13,378 --> 00:59:15,280
I was taking in
a harmonious moment

774
00:59:15,281 --> 00:59:19,053
between a serene butterfly
and an unruffled caterpillar.

775
00:59:19,054 --> 00:59:20,824
Such tranquility.

776
00:59:20,825 --> 00:59:24,355
Yo-ho-ho. where you from?
Cybertron.

777
00:59:24,356 --> 00:59:26,962
So where‘d you get that accent?
Accent? What accent?

778
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:29,327
You know what I‘m saying?
I‘m just saying it‘s cool.

779
00:59:29,328 --> 00:59:31,835
I was about to be like, "¿Yo,
mira, papi, de dónde eres?"

780
00:59:31,836 --> 00:59:35,498
I didn‘t want to assume
that you speak Spanish too,

781
00:59:35,499 --> 00:59:36,939
because then... Right?

782
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:39,810
Mmm.
Hermano.

783
00:59:39,811 --> 00:59:41,878
I‘m not trying to be,
you know... Yo.

784
00:59:41,879 --> 00:59:45,145
But anyway... The mission.
Follow me.

785
00:59:45,146 --> 00:59:47,247
But he‘s a robot, like, so,

786
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:49,623
how‘s that racist?

787
00:59:53,286 --> 00:59:55,320
Okay, you guys, check this out.

788
00:59:55,321 --> 00:59:58,488
The coordinates you gave me
correspond to an old church.

789
00:59:58,489 --> 00:59:59,589
Take a look.

790
01:00:02,130 --> 01:00:05,770
That‘s Santo Domingo. The Spanish
built it on top of an old Inca temple.

791
01:00:05,771 --> 01:00:09,741
I picked up some residual energy
readings around the courtyard,

792
01:00:09,742 --> 01:00:12,370
so I‘m guessing
the key‘s somewhere close by.

793
01:00:12,371 --> 01:00:14,680
But we may have some trouble
getting there.

794
01:00:14,681 --> 01:00:16,242
Inti Raymi.

795
01:00:16,243 --> 01:00:18,981
It‘s a festival that
shuts down the whole city.

796
01:00:18,982 --> 01:00:21,445
Guess it‘s a night mission then.
No.

797
01:00:21,446 --> 01:00:23,788
Scourge could already be here.

798
01:00:23,789 --> 01:00:27,122
We must retrieve
the other half before he does.

799
01:00:29,256 --> 01:00:31,730
Me and Elena will do it.
Hmm?

800
01:00:31,731 --> 01:00:33,930
Y‘all would never
make it two blocks.

801
01:00:33,931 --> 01:00:36,559
There‘s human security all around
the church. You‘ll never get through.

802
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:39,463
Then we‘ll have to take
a play out of your book.

803
01:00:39,464 --> 01:00:41,740
We‘ll hide in plain sight.

804
01:00:41,741 --> 01:00:44,072
We‘ll blend in with the parade.

805
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:47,042
It is not a bad idea.

806
01:00:47,043 --> 01:00:49,913
We will keep an eye out
for the Terrorcons.

807
01:00:49,914 --> 01:00:53,609
On first sign of trouble,
we are going in.

808
01:00:53,610 --> 01:00:55,282
Yo, Noah, think fast.

809
01:01:01,321 --> 01:01:03,653
And if you need help,
just holler.

810
01:01:19,108 --> 01:01:21,670
I am in position.

811
01:01:21,671 --> 01:01:23,639
All right, coast is clear.

812
01:01:23,640 --> 01:01:26,346
Noah, Elena, it‘s go time.

813
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:29,349
Blend in. Act natural.

814
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:05,021
Autobots must be using
their new pets

815
01:02:05,022 --> 01:02:07,155
to reach the temple.

816
01:02:07,156 --> 01:02:09,454
Lovely.

817
01:02:09,455 --> 01:02:12,226
They‘re doing our work for us.

818
01:02:12,227 --> 01:02:14,460
Go fetch.

819
01:02:19,168 --> 01:02:21,269
The key‘s gotta be
in here somewhere.

820
01:02:21,973 --> 01:02:23,073
Yeah.

821
01:02:36,889 --> 01:02:39,583
That stonework is 17th century.

822
01:02:39,584 --> 01:02:42,752
What we‘re looking for
is something

823
01:02:43,522 --> 01:02:46,426
much, much older.

824
01:02:54,731 --> 01:02:57,437
What is it? It‘s the
same insignia on Airazor.

825
01:02:58,306 --> 01:03:00,143
But it‘s not lined up right.

826
01:03:02,816 --> 01:03:04,575
Wait, you see that?

827
01:03:04,576 --> 01:03:09,614
I think there‘s something
under here.

828
01:03:13,354 --> 01:03:14,927
There‘s another one.

829
01:03:19,228 --> 01:03:20,757
There is.

830
01:03:29,799 --> 01:03:30,976
Now what?

831
01:03:48,092 --> 01:03:50,457
That‘s some
Indiana Jones-type shit.

832
01:03:51,821 --> 01:03:53,559
You sure about this?

833
01:03:54,164 --> 01:03:55,264
No.

834
01:04:04,042 --> 01:04:06,307
Any sign of Scourge?

835
01:04:06,308 --> 01:04:07,638
Nope, all clear here.

836
01:04:07,639 --> 01:04:09,442
Uh, yeah.

837
01:04:09,443 --> 01:04:10,982
It‘s just groupies over here.

838
01:04:10,983 --> 01:04:13,347
Stay on task, Mirage.

839
01:04:13,348 --> 01:04:16,285
Prime, you gotta learn
how to relax, my man.

840
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:24,931
Ah.

841
01:04:38,835 --> 01:04:42,949
You know, we must be the first people
to walk here in half a millennium.

842
01:04:44,676 --> 01:04:47,184
Yo, Sonic. You dead yet?

843
01:04:48,812 --> 01:04:49,989
No.

844
01:04:50,847 --> 01:04:52,991
Wait, did you just
call me Sonic?

845
01:04:52,992 --> 01:04:54,455
I think that‘s a temple.

846
01:05:01,066 --> 01:05:03,166
What are we looking for?

847
01:05:03,167 --> 01:05:05,234
You see the symbols
on that temple?

848
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:07,137
They match the ones
in the courtyard.

849
01:05:07,138 --> 01:05:08,634
I think it‘s up there.

850
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:22,714
I think we found
what we came here for.

851
01:05:25,189 --> 01:05:27,091
I always wondered
what it would feel like

852
01:05:27,092 --> 01:05:29,853
to be there when artifacts
were actually found.

853
01:05:32,592 --> 01:05:35,265
All right. Now come on, push.

854
01:05:43,042 --> 01:05:45,208
Are you even pushing?

855
01:05:45,209 --> 01:05:47,376
Yeah, I‘m pushing.

856
01:05:58,552 --> 01:06:00,784
Wait, what?
Just... Just let me think.

857
01:06:00,785 --> 01:06:02,786
Oh, no, no. Where is it?

858
01:06:02,787 --> 01:06:07,033
Sometimes there‘s, like, a...
like a false bottom or something.

859
01:06:10,432 --> 01:06:11,927
Look.

860
01:06:11,928 --> 01:06:14,864
I think I found something.
You see these symbols?

861
01:06:14,865 --> 01:06:18,175
I‘ve seen markings like this...
the Airazor statue at my museum.

862
01:06:18,176 --> 01:06:20,309
They‘re new.

863
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:22,674
They‘re not
on the Transwarp Key.

864
01:06:22,675 --> 01:06:24,380
There‘s two of them.

865
01:06:33,290 --> 01:06:34,522
Mirage?

866
01:06:38,757 --> 01:06:41,562
Let‘s keep moving.
Just give me a second.

867
01:06:45,797 --> 01:06:47,304
Run!

868
01:06:54,773 --> 01:06:56,576
Go, go, go, go, go!

869
01:06:56,577 --> 01:06:58,743
Mirage! We got trouble!

870
01:06:58,744 --> 01:07:01,680
One of those things is down here!
Where are you guys?

871
01:07:01,681 --> 01:07:03,749
Hang tight!
I‘m on the way.

872
01:07:06,290 --> 01:07:07,851
The Autobots are moving.

873
01:07:07,852 --> 01:07:10,261
They must have found the key.

874
01:07:21,503 --> 01:07:22,933
Come on!

875
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,034
Airazor, where are the humans?

876
01:07:26,035 --> 01:07:28,873
They‘re underground,
heading towards the jungle.

877
01:07:46,297 --> 01:07:48,464
Aw, man, they‘re tailing us!

878
01:07:58,243 --> 01:08:00,278
Do something!
What do you want me to do?

879
01:08:08,044 --> 01:08:09,914
You had a gun this whole time?

880
01:08:28,064 --> 01:08:30,274
Prime, what the hell
are you doing?

881
01:08:30,275 --> 01:08:33,101
I‘m going to take back
Scourge‘s key

882
01:08:33,102 --> 01:08:36,446
and then take off his head.

883
01:08:47,919 --> 01:08:50,888
Guys!
I could use a little help!

884
01:08:50,889 --> 01:08:53,023
Did someone call for backup?

885
01:09:01,306 --> 01:09:02,966
Brake, brake, brake!
What?

886
01:09:02,967 --> 01:09:05,277
Brake!

887
01:09:12,647 --> 01:09:15,386
Yay!

888
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:18,587
This is for Bee!

889
01:09:30,467 --> 01:09:32,160
Come here.

890
01:09:32,161 --> 01:09:33,536
Hold on!

891
01:09:53,556 --> 01:09:56,327
I love your fire, Prime.

892
01:09:56,328 --> 01:10:00,155
But you‘re going to die
on this speck of dust.

893
01:10:00,156 --> 01:10:04,028
I can think of no better place
to bury you.

894
01:10:31,825 --> 01:10:34,333
I will end you, Scourge.

895
01:10:36,027 --> 01:10:39,700
That is a promise.

896
01:10:39,701 --> 01:10:41,339
They‘re getting away.

897
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:43,166
Not this time.

898
01:10:50,173 --> 01:10:52,417
I hear water.

899
01:10:56,355 --> 01:10:57,818
Where are we?

900
01:11:04,022 --> 01:11:05,089
What was that?

901
01:11:19,235 --> 01:11:21,269
Who are you?

902
01:11:21,270 --> 01:11:23,139
And why are you hunting
for the key?

903
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:25,614
Yo, Donkey Kong!
Stay away from my friends!

904
01:11:25,615 --> 01:11:28,519
Uh, Mirage? Don‘t worry.
Your boy‘s got this.

905
01:11:31,082 --> 01:11:33,689
Stranger danger!
Stranger danger!

906
01:11:34,426 --> 01:11:36,328
Hey, hey, hey!

907
01:11:36,329 --> 01:11:37,429
Not so fa...

908
01:11:41,928 --> 01:11:43,060
Ay, ay, ay.

909
01:11:43,061 --> 01:11:45,701
Hey! Over here,
kitty, kitty.

910
01:11:46,768 --> 01:11:49,672
Stand down!

911
01:11:51,509 --> 01:11:54,677
I won‘t ask a second time.

912
01:11:59,242 --> 01:12:01,486
No! All of you, stop!

913
01:12:04,456 --> 01:12:06,721
Airazor.
Primal.

914
01:12:06,722 --> 01:12:09,790
I thought you were lost.
All of you.

915
01:12:09,791 --> 01:12:13,057
The others... Are they...

916
01:12:13,058 --> 01:12:15,698
I am all that is left.

917
01:12:19,130 --> 01:12:22,539
Prime, these are
my fellow Maximals.

918
01:12:22,540 --> 01:12:24,970
Rhinox.

919
01:12:24,971 --> 01:12:26,576
Cheetor.

920
01:12:26,577 --> 01:12:28,336
Sorry about scaring you, brother.

921
01:12:28,337 --> 01:12:30,382
Scared?
Please.

922
01:12:30,383 --> 01:12:31,944
I‘m not scared.

923
01:12:31,945 --> 01:12:33,517
That‘s just engine oil.

924
01:12:33,518 --> 01:12:38,050
And our leader, Optimus Primal.

925
01:12:38,853 --> 01:12:40,920
Optimus Primal?

926
01:12:40,921 --> 01:12:45,221
Named after you, the legendary
warrior of Cybertron.

927
01:12:45,222 --> 01:12:46,465
It‘s an honor.

928
01:12:47,862 --> 01:12:51,029
Airazor, I‘m happy to
see you, old friend.

929
01:12:51,030 --> 01:12:54,197
But bringing others here
was not part of our plan.

930
01:12:54,198 --> 01:12:56,738
I fear you bring dark tidings.

931
01:12:56,739 --> 01:12:59,037
Scourge has come to Earth.

932
01:12:59,038 --> 01:13:00,874
He‘s found us.

933
01:13:00,875 --> 01:13:03,371
And he has half of the key.

934
01:13:03,372 --> 01:13:06,176
We must find the second
piece before he does.

935
01:13:06,177 --> 01:13:08,079
But it wasn‘t in the cave.

936
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:11,148
It was. But we moved it
long ago to keep it safe.

937
01:13:11,149 --> 01:13:13,492
Where is it now?

938
01:13:16,792 --> 01:13:18,123
Come with me.

939
01:13:26,362 --> 01:13:28,330
That doesn‘t look so good.

940
01:13:28,331 --> 01:13:31,708
When Scourge touches you,
he leaves a mark.

941
01:13:32,401 --> 01:13:34,546
But I‘ll be all right.

942
01:13:47,416 --> 01:13:49,461
Hey, back there
you called me Sonic.

943
01:13:49,462 --> 01:13:51,628
Yeah. Your little bro‘s
got this thing

944
01:13:51,629 --> 01:13:54,422
about using real names
over the airwaves, so...

945
01:13:54,423 --> 01:13:56,226
Wait, you been talking to Kris?
Uh-huh.

946
01:13:56,227 --> 01:13:59,702
He gave me this
to keep tabs on you,

947
01:13:59,703 --> 01:14:01,198
make sure I‘m keeping
my promise.

948
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:02,771
Oh, here.

949
01:14:02,772 --> 01:14:04,905
Next time,
include warning labels.

950
01:14:04,906 --> 01:14:07,842
Nah, go ahead, keep it.

951
01:14:07,843 --> 01:14:09,943
I guess it does
look better on me.

952
01:14:09,944 --> 01:14:12,584
Just don‘t ask what part
of my body it came from.

953
01:14:15,378 --> 01:14:17,621
So, who are you?

954
01:14:17,622 --> 01:14:19,755
We Maximals are an advanced race

955
01:14:19,756 --> 01:14:24,023
dedicated to the expansion of
life throughout the universe.

956
01:14:24,024 --> 01:14:27,356
We use the Transwarp Key
to visit young worlds.

957
01:14:27,357 --> 01:14:31,096
The Nazca Lines,
the Temple at Tikal...

958
01:14:31,097 --> 01:14:32,801
That was you guys, right?

959
01:14:32,802 --> 01:14:34,198
Not us.

960
01:14:34,199 --> 01:14:36,739
We cannot claim credit
for human ingenuity.

961
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:40,237
But you had the key.
Why stay on this world?

962
01:14:40,238 --> 01:14:42,778
When Unicron destroyed
our world,

963
01:14:42,779 --> 01:14:46,617
we took an oath dedicated
to the preservation of life,

964
01:14:46,618 --> 01:14:48,652
no matter the cost.

965
01:14:48,653 --> 01:14:50,985
And Earth
has been a safe refuge.

966
01:15:30,222 --> 01:15:32,564
This is Amaru.

967
01:15:32,565 --> 01:15:35,699
He and his family are the
last descendants of a tribe

968
01:15:35,700 --> 01:15:38,603
that has watched over us
for hundreds of years.

969
01:15:38,604 --> 01:15:43,641
When we arrived, they
shared their world with us.

970
01:15:43,642 --> 01:15:46,105
And together
we protected its people

971
01:15:46,106 --> 01:15:48,944
and our secret.

972
01:15:55,511 --> 01:15:57,447
You allied with humans.

973
01:15:58,316 --> 01:16:00,054
We did.

974
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:03,793
If you give us this key,

975
01:16:03,794 --> 01:16:07,962
tomorrow I will light the beacon
and bring Scourge to us.

976
01:16:07,963 --> 01:16:12,461
The Maximals have already sacrificed
one home to protect the universe.

977
01:16:12,462 --> 01:16:14,870
I won‘t risk losing another.

978
01:16:14,871 --> 01:16:17,610
As a leader,
I know you understand.

979
01:16:42,668 --> 01:16:46,363
He is not the Optimus Prime
I imagined.

980
01:16:46,364 --> 01:16:49,366
Well, he has lost so much.

981
01:16:49,367 --> 01:16:51,368
Many more will perish

982
01:16:51,369 --> 01:16:54,536
if the key falls
into the wrong hands.

983
01:16:54,537 --> 01:16:58,342
If you had another chance
to save our home,

984
01:16:58,343 --> 01:17:00,180
would you act any differently?

985
01:17:04,316 --> 01:17:07,550
Optimus, come.
I want to show you something.

986
01:17:12,357 --> 01:17:14,667
Your friend
will find peace here.

987
01:17:16,295 --> 01:17:19,066
This is raw Energon.

988
01:17:19,067 --> 01:17:21,101
The valley is rich with it.

989
01:17:21,102 --> 01:17:23,598
Could this revive Bee?

990
01:17:23,599 --> 01:17:27,074
I‘m sorry, but in this
state, it is inert.

991
01:17:27,075 --> 01:17:29,747
It would take a great power
to ignite it.

992
01:17:29,748 --> 01:17:32,685
Greater than anything
we have here.

993
01:17:35,248 --> 01:17:38,382
I see that you are surprised
we entrust the key to them.

994
01:17:38,383 --> 01:17:40,318
Yes, I am.

995
01:17:40,319 --> 01:17:43,222
I‘ve been amongst them
a long time now.

996
01:17:43,223 --> 01:17:46,489
There is more to them
than meets the eye.

997
01:17:46,490 --> 01:17:48,525
They are worth saving.

998
01:17:59,470 --> 01:18:00,570
Hmm.

999
01:18:23,329 --> 01:18:24,935
What if we didn‘t destroy it?

1000
01:18:27,267 --> 01:18:32,568
Maybe there‘s another way
to... to save both our homes.

1001
01:18:32,569 --> 01:18:35,748
Elena, I made a lot
of mistakes in my life.

1002
01:18:37,409 --> 01:18:39,048
This is different.

1003
01:18:41,479 --> 01:18:43,283
I can‘t fail at this.

1004
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:46,285
I can‘t let my family down.

1005
01:18:46,286 --> 01:18:49,354
You‘re just like him.
You know that?

1006
01:18:49,355 --> 01:18:50,718
Who?

1007
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:51,995
Optimus.

1008
01:18:53,458 --> 01:18:55,030
I‘m serious.

1009
01:18:55,031 --> 01:18:58,462
He feels it too.
Feels what?

1010
01:18:58,463 --> 01:19:00,629
Like a beast of burden

1011
01:19:00,630 --> 01:19:04,601
just trying to carry the weight
of the world on his shoulders.

1012
01:19:06,009 --> 01:19:09,539
You think he‘s some...
Some general barking orders,

1013
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:11,882
but when I look at him,

1014
01:19:11,883 --> 01:19:14,853
all I see is a big brother
trying to protect his family.

1015
01:20:12,438 --> 01:20:13,846
Are you okay?

1016
01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:21,545
Airazor?

1017
01:20:21,546 --> 01:20:25,285
I can feel Scourge!

1018
01:20:25,286 --> 01:20:27,893
He‘s...
in my mind.

1019
01:20:37,265 --> 01:20:39,938
Run, Elena!

1020
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:44,008
No!

1021
01:20:47,539 --> 01:20:50,607
Airazor.

1022
01:20:50,608 --> 01:20:52,048
They found us.

1023
01:20:52,049 --> 01:20:55,513
Everyone, defensive positions!

1024
01:20:55,514 --> 01:20:58,153
Noah, guard the key.

1025
01:20:58,154 --> 01:21:01,388
Take Elena and find
someplace safe to hide.

1026
01:21:02,851 --> 01:21:04,754
We must protect the humans.

1027
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:09,197
Miss me?

1028
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:12,168
Noah, Elena, get out of here!

1029
01:21:28,085 --> 01:21:29,845
We have to destroy it.

1030
01:21:32,023 --> 01:21:33,221
Noah!

1031
01:21:33,222 --> 01:21:34,817
No!

1032
01:21:35,653 --> 01:21:37,424
Don‘t.

1033
01:21:39,822 --> 01:21:43,660
I know you want
to protect your people,

1034
01:21:43,661 --> 01:21:46,432
but if you destroy that key,

1035
01:21:46,433 --> 01:21:49,402
our home will be lost forever.

1036
01:21:49,403 --> 01:21:51,735
We do not have to choose.

1037
01:21:58,412 --> 01:22:00,315
Please, Noah.

1038
01:22:18,597 --> 01:22:20,368
Elena!

1039
01:22:24,669 --> 01:22:25,769
Go!

1040
01:22:47,725 --> 01:22:49,199
Elena!

1041
01:22:54,237 --> 01:22:58,142
Wait, wait.
Didn‘t I kill you already?

1042
01:22:59,110 --> 01:23:00,869
No!

1043
01:23:00,870 --> 01:23:03,575
I‘m the Maximal that‘s going
to rip out your spark.

1044
01:23:03,576 --> 01:23:06,776
We‘ll see about that.

1045
01:23:06,777 --> 01:23:07,910
Kill them!

1046
01:23:14,752 --> 01:23:16,093
Airazor, no!

1047
01:23:16,094 --> 01:23:18,986
I can‘t hold it back...

1048
01:23:18,987 --> 01:23:20,922
much longer.

1049
01:23:20,923 --> 01:23:23,332
Fight it, Airazor.

1050
01:23:24,267 --> 01:23:27,302
Remember our oath, Primal.

1051
01:23:27,303 --> 01:23:29,997
No matter the cost.

1052
01:23:29,998 --> 01:23:33,672
I can‘t hold it back!
Airazor, no!

1053
01:23:45,321 --> 01:23:46,685
Primal!

1054
01:23:54,022 --> 01:23:57,299
It‘s okay.

1055
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:58,829
Do it.

1056
01:24:22,622 --> 01:24:24,294
Primal.

1057
01:24:25,691 --> 01:24:27,594
No matter the cost.

1058
01:24:36,603 --> 01:24:38,374
Elena!
Elena, look at me.

1059
01:24:39,639 --> 01:24:40,937
Are you okay?

1060
01:24:43,676 --> 01:24:45,282
Scourge has the key.

1061
01:25:29,920 --> 01:25:34,595
Awaken, almighty Unicron.
Your time has come.

1062
01:26:37,625 --> 01:26:40,594
I am sorry, Noah.

1063
01:26:40,595 --> 01:26:42,432
You were looking out
for your own.

1064
01:26:45,468 --> 01:26:47,535
I can‘t even be angry
at you for that.

1065
01:26:47,536 --> 01:26:52,001
On my home world, we believe that the
battle with darkness will continue

1066
01:26:52,002 --> 01:26:54,202
till all are one.

1067
01:26:55,676 --> 01:26:57,776
I lost sight of that.

1068
01:26:57,777 --> 01:27:01,846
You fought for yours
as I fought for mine

1069
01:27:01,847 --> 01:27:05,356
when we should have been
fighting the darkness together.

1070
01:27:08,986 --> 01:27:11,461
Well, I ain‘t done fighting yet.

1071
01:27:16,059 --> 01:27:18,192
All right, everybody, squad up!

1072
01:27:18,193 --> 01:27:19,864
Bring it in.

1073
01:27:19,865 --> 01:27:21,899
There‘s got to be a way
to stop this dude.

1074
01:27:21,900 --> 01:27:26,035
It‘s too late. The Transwarp
has already been activated.

1075
01:27:26,036 --> 01:27:28,807
It has more energy
than a supernova.

1076
01:27:28,808 --> 01:27:31,712
Any interruption
will ignite it like a bomb.

1077
01:27:32,878 --> 01:27:34,747
The only way
to stop this process

1078
01:27:34,748 --> 01:27:38,146
is an access code installed
long ago as a safeguard.

1079
01:27:38,147 --> 01:27:39,653
Okay, what‘s the code then?

1080
01:27:39,654 --> 01:27:42,359
The code was split
along with the key.

1081
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:46,594
Sadly, the second half of
that code died with Airazor.

1082
01:27:46,595 --> 01:27:48,156
No, wait, wait, wait.
I got it.

1083
01:27:48,157 --> 01:27:49,861
The one hiding
her half of the key...

1084
01:27:49,862 --> 01:27:51,665
That had markings in it

1085
01:27:51,666 --> 01:27:54,096
just like the ones I found in
the cave where you hid yours.

1086
01:27:54,097 --> 01:27:57,165
Together, they must complete
the access code.

1087
01:27:57,166 --> 01:27:58,232
Hmm.

1088
01:27:58,233 --> 01:28:00,201
So we got a chance now, right?

1089
01:28:00,202 --> 01:28:01,741
A slim chance.

1090
01:28:01,742 --> 01:28:03,710
That is all we need

1091
01:28:03,711 --> 01:28:06,318
if you will show us the way, Primal.

1092
01:28:09,277 --> 01:28:12,048
All right.
We need to move quickly.

1093
01:28:12,049 --> 01:28:14,281
We have a small window
before the portal opens

1094
01:28:14,282 --> 01:28:16,118
large enough
for Unicron to enter.

1095
01:28:16,119 --> 01:28:19,429
The bridge is girded
by a series of tunnels.

1096
01:28:19,430 --> 01:28:21,794
They are too small
for Maximals, but...

1097
01:28:21,795 --> 01:28:23,631
But not for humans.

1098
01:28:23,632 --> 01:28:27,404
If Noah and Elena
reach the central antenna,

1099
01:28:27,405 --> 01:28:29,901
they can use the code
to shut it down,

1100
01:28:29,902 --> 01:28:32,574
remove the Transwarp Key...

1101
01:28:32,575 --> 01:28:36,578
and close the portal before
Unicron enters our atmosphere.

1102
01:28:36,579 --> 01:28:38,778
But Scourge will be
watching our every move.

1103
01:28:38,779 --> 01:28:41,275
He‘ll do anything to stop us
from getting the key.

1104
01:28:41,276 --> 01:28:43,486
Then we bring the fight to him.

1105
01:28:43,487 --> 01:28:45,818
Autobots and Maximals

1106
01:28:45,819 --> 01:28:48,183
will charge the bridge together

1107
01:28:48,184 --> 01:28:50,856
and lure Scourge
onto the battlefield.

1108
01:28:50,857 --> 01:28:53,761
While me and Elena sneak in
through the back way.

1109
01:28:56,896 --> 01:28:59,195
It sounds like
we‘re all going to die.

1110
01:29:00,801 --> 01:29:05,508
If we are to die,
then we will die fighting

1111
01:29:05,509 --> 01:29:07,511
all as one.

1112
01:29:19,688 --> 01:29:23,593
This world is yours, master.

1113
01:29:24,319 --> 01:29:26,287
Scourge,

1114
01:29:26,288 --> 01:29:27,696
they‘re back.

1115
01:29:33,097 --> 01:29:36,771
Prime.

1116
01:29:38,201 --> 01:29:42,238
Protect the key. Don‘t let
them get to the bridge.

1117
01:30:02,830 --> 01:30:04,160
Maximals!

1118
01:30:04,161 --> 01:30:05,997
Autobots!

1119
01:30:05,998 --> 01:30:07,703
Roll out!

1120
01:30:18,681 --> 01:30:21,981
Rhinox, Cheetor, maximize!

1121
01:30:45,433 --> 01:30:47,401
At least
the foot soldiers took the bait.

1122
01:30:47,402 --> 01:30:49,711
Yeah, but Scourge didn‘t.
He‘s guarding the key.

1123
01:30:49,712 --> 01:30:53,880
All right. This should lead to the
bottom of the Transwarp control panel.

1124
01:30:53,881 --> 01:30:57,246
Get the key, get the hell out of there.
What are you gonna do?

1125
01:30:57,247 --> 01:30:59,380
I‘m gonna go distract Scourge.

1126
01:30:59,381 --> 01:31:01,118
No, you can‘t take on
Scourge alone.

1127
01:31:01,119 --> 01:31:03,858
Relax.
I‘m Mirage, remember?

1128
01:31:04,287 --> 01:31:05,695
Hey.

1129
01:31:41,126 --> 01:31:43,391
One, two, three!

1130
01:31:43,392 --> 01:31:45,460
Whoomp! There it is! Pow!

1131
01:31:46,769 --> 01:31:47,968
We gotta hurry up.

1132
01:31:56,141 --> 01:31:58,682
Someone give me a real fight!

1133
01:32:01,014 --> 01:32:04,017
It‘s a fight you want?
You got one.

1134
01:32:18,130 --> 01:32:20,605
He was mine.

1135
01:32:21,705 --> 01:32:22,970
Nope!

1136
01:32:23,465 --> 01:32:24,576
Missed me!

1137
01:32:27,271 --> 01:32:29,844
Noah, get to the key.

1138
01:32:29,845 --> 01:32:31,505
Mirage!

1139
01:32:31,506 --> 01:32:33,881
What do we have here?

1140
01:32:33,882 --> 01:32:35,884
Elena, go!

1141
01:32:39,052 --> 01:32:43,760
Brave, but futile.

1142
01:32:46,697 --> 01:32:49,601
Hey! Don‘t mess with my boy!

1143
01:33:12,316 --> 01:33:13,658
Mirage.

1144
01:33:19,059 --> 01:33:22,260
No one will remember
this pathetic planet.

1145
01:33:23,558 --> 01:33:26,704
And no one will remember you.

1146
01:33:30,807 --> 01:33:32,401
Mirage, what are you doing?

1147
01:33:32,402 --> 01:33:34,744
Keeping my promise.

1148
01:33:34,745 --> 01:33:37,406
Mirage, no!
Come on, you gotta get up!

1149
01:33:37,407 --> 01:33:39,046
It‘s okay, Noah.

1150
01:33:44,315 --> 01:33:45,921
Home... Home team.

1151
01:33:47,956 --> 01:33:49,551
Home team.

1152
01:33:52,730 --> 01:33:54,490
Mirage!

1153
01:33:57,262 --> 01:33:58,802
Mirage?

1154
01:34:00,969 --> 01:34:03,873
Mirage.

1155
01:34:04,676 --> 01:34:06,634
Kill the other human.

1156
01:34:43,979 --> 01:34:45,749
Unicron.

1157
01:34:45,750 --> 01:34:48,444
You fought bravely.

1158
01:34:48,445 --> 01:34:52,757
But this world is already mine.

1159
01:35:01,997 --> 01:35:03,559
We‘re too late.

1160
01:35:12,777 --> 01:35:14,438
Yo!
Hey!

1161
01:35:16,671 --> 01:35:21,082
Hey! Look!

1162
01:35:33,688 --> 01:35:36,294
Hey, Knuckles.

1163
01:35:36,295 --> 01:35:39,231
You there? Over.

1164
01:35:39,232 --> 01:35:40,596
Yo, Sonic.

1165
01:35:41,201 --> 01:35:43,236
Kris!
Noah?

1166
01:35:43,973 --> 01:35:45,534
What‘s going on?

1167
01:35:45,535 --> 01:35:47,173
Where‘s Mirage?

1168
01:35:47,174 --> 01:35:50,506
He... He‘s gone.

1169
01:35:50,507 --> 01:35:51,849
Gone?

1170
01:35:53,917 --> 01:35:56,645
No.

1171
01:35:59,153 --> 01:36:00,748
I‘m sorry, Kris.

1172
01:36:08,261 --> 01:36:10,361
I‘m not gonna win this one.

1173
01:36:10,362 --> 01:36:12,727
But you don‘t lose, right?

1174
01:36:13,365 --> 01:36:14,839
I wish that were true,

1175
01:36:15,763 --> 01:36:16,907
but I can‘t.

1176
01:36:23,276 --> 01:36:25,113
Yes, you can.

1177
01:36:26,081 --> 01:36:28,116
No.

1178
01:36:29,744 --> 01:36:32,218
No, man, I‘m not you.

1179
01:36:32,219 --> 01:36:33,483
I hate being sick.

1180
01:36:33,484 --> 01:36:35,056
Whenever I wanna give up,

1181
01:36:35,057 --> 01:36:37,521
you‘re always there
telling me to keep going.

1182
01:36:38,192 --> 01:36:39,588
But now it‘s my turn.

1183
01:36:39,589 --> 01:36:41,327
Keep going, Noah.

1184
01:36:43,395 --> 01:36:47,871
You think you‘re a nobody, but
you‘re the strongest guy I know.

1185
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:50,468
You guys are so cute.

1186
01:36:51,106 --> 01:36:52,205
Mirage?

1187
01:36:52,206 --> 01:36:54,207
You‘re alive!

1188
01:36:54,208 --> 01:36:59,675
Uh, yeah, but... I‘m gonna
need you to take the wheel.

1189
01:37:10,521 --> 01:37:12,424
You can do this.

1190
01:37:17,066 --> 01:37:18,935
‘Cause you‘re my brother.

1191
01:37:18,936 --> 01:37:21,906
Noah Diaz from Wilson Avenue,

1192
01:37:23,270 --> 01:37:25,668
Apartment 2-C,
Brooklyn, New York.

1193
01:37:29,111 --> 01:37:31,278
No names over the airwaves.

1194
01:37:31,916 --> 01:37:33,378
Forget that.

1195
01:37:33,379 --> 01:37:34,919
Let ‘em know who you are.

1196
01:37:39,484 --> 01:37:41,123
Yo, Scourge!

1197
01:37:46,194 --> 01:37:47,822
Remember me?

1198
01:38:08,645 --> 01:38:11,714
You think
you can take me on alone?

1199
01:38:14,750 --> 01:38:17,093
He is not alone.

1200
01:39:02,974 --> 01:39:05,075
I‘m never
leaving Brooklyn again.

1201
01:39:17,450 --> 01:39:20,420
Ah! Energon.

1202
01:39:49,977 --> 01:39:51,484
Prime!

1203
01:39:54,091 --> 01:39:55,191
Noah!

1204
01:40:12,241 --> 01:40:15,574
I‘m getting really tired
of you humans.

1205
01:40:48,607 --> 01:40:50,938
Bee!

1206
01:40:55,647 --> 01:40:59,387
You again.
You should‘ve stayed dead!

1207
01:41:21,244 --> 01:41:24,037
I have come here to kick ass.

1208
01:41:24,038 --> 01:41:25,412
Glad to have you back.

1209
01:41:25,413 --> 01:41:27,414
Everyone guard the bridge!

1210
01:41:27,415 --> 01:41:30,385
Elena, shut it down!

1211
01:41:36,457 --> 01:41:38,392
We gotta give her some cover!

1212
01:41:38,393 --> 01:41:39,988
We‘ll clear the way.

1213
01:41:42,892 --> 01:41:44,695
That‘s what I‘m talkin‘ about.

1214
01:41:44,696 --> 01:41:48,172
Punch in an access code...
How hard could that be?

1215
01:41:51,769 --> 01:41:53,672
Oh, you‘ve gotta be kidding me.

1216
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:01,779
Just you and me, Scourge.

1217
01:42:06,223 --> 01:42:10,083
Let‘s end this once and for all.

1218
01:42:10,084 --> 01:42:12,052
Master, the reinforcements!

1219
01:42:33,316 --> 01:42:34,613
All right, I got this.

1220
01:42:34,614 --> 01:42:35,714
Let‘s go, Bee!

1221
01:42:44,118 --> 01:42:46,329
Say hello to my little friend!

1222
01:43:09,451 --> 01:43:10,881
We gotta hurry!

1223
01:43:11,618 --> 01:43:12,652
Last one.

1224
01:43:13,620 --> 01:43:15,952
Die, you ugly mother...

1225
01:43:52,527 --> 01:43:56,333
You will never see Unicron
take this world.

1226
01:44:03,032 --> 01:44:04,670
You did it!

1227
01:44:04,671 --> 01:44:06,199
Brooklyn, baby!

1228
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:08,312
No!

1229
01:44:08,873 --> 01:44:11,006
Unicron will prevail!

1230
01:44:11,007 --> 01:44:12,580
Elena!

1231
01:44:16,045 --> 01:44:18,113
I‘ve had enough!

1232
01:44:20,786 --> 01:44:24,559
Time to show you
the real power of the Prime!

1233
01:44:28,398 --> 01:44:31,566
This belongs
to a friend of mine!

1234
01:44:44,546 --> 01:44:45,646
The panel,

1235
01:44:46,416 --> 01:44:47,879
it‘s destroyed.

1236
01:44:48,649 --> 01:44:50,112
I can‘t stop it.

1237
01:44:51,454 --> 01:44:53,983
Autobots, Maximals,

1238
01:44:53,984 --> 01:44:55,622
retreat to safety.

1239
01:44:55,623 --> 01:44:58,757
I will destroy the key myself.

1240
01:44:58,758 --> 01:45:00,429
Prime! No!

1241
01:45:00,430 --> 01:45:02,057
There‘s gotta be another way.

1242
01:45:02,058 --> 01:45:03,928
Bee, protect them.

1243
01:45:12,706 --> 01:45:16,512
Your sacrifice becomes our oath.

1244
01:45:17,238 --> 01:45:20,109
Thank you, my friends.

1245
01:45:24,388 --> 01:45:27,489
Bee!

1246
01:45:27,490 --> 01:45:29,591
We can‘t leave him!

1247
01:45:36,092 --> 01:45:38,325
Everyone, on me!

1248
01:45:50,139 --> 01:45:51,843
Don‘t, Prime.

1249
01:45:51,844 --> 01:45:55,110
I can give you
everything you want.

1250
01:45:55,111 --> 01:45:56,552
Then die.

1251
01:46:34,920 --> 01:46:36,019
Noah.

1252
01:46:36,020 --> 01:46:37,527
I got you!

1253
01:46:48,670 --> 01:46:51,398
Let me go, Noah.
Save yourself.

1254
01:46:53,477 --> 01:46:56,007
Till all are one.

1255
01:47:15,994 --> 01:47:18,095
Till all are one.

1256
01:47:30,613 --> 01:47:31,944
Punch it, Prime.

1257
01:47:59,433 --> 01:48:00,544
Yeah, baby!

1258
01:48:31,366 --> 01:48:33,972
Unicron...
Is he dead?

1259
01:48:33,973 --> 01:48:37,173
Trapped, but not dead.

1260
01:48:37,174 --> 01:48:39,715
Evil can never
be vanquished completely.

1261
01:48:40,683 --> 01:48:42,145
He could return.

1262
01:48:42,146 --> 01:48:44,246
Let him come.

1263
01:48:44,247 --> 01:48:47,282
United, we will destroy him,

1264
01:48:47,283 --> 01:48:49,384
once and for all.

1265
01:48:53,157 --> 01:48:55,422
I am Optimus Prime,

1266
01:48:55,423 --> 01:48:57,392
leader of the Autobots.

1267
01:48:58,195 --> 01:49:00,526
We have lost the Transwarp Key

1268
01:49:00,527 --> 01:49:03,640
and with it
our ability to go home.

1269
01:49:06,643 --> 01:49:09,139
But we have gained an ally

1270
01:49:09,140 --> 01:49:12,472
in our battle against
the forces of evil.

1271
01:49:12,473 --> 01:49:14,848
Forces too powerful

1272
01:49:14,849 --> 01:49:18,478
for any of us
to defeat on our own.

1273
01:49:18,479 --> 01:49:22,593
But together,
we might just have a chance.

1274
01:49:31,767 --> 01:49:34,835
I am Noah Diaz.

1275
01:49:34,836 --> 01:49:37,200
What is there to know about me?

1276
01:49:37,201 --> 01:49:39,873
I was raised out in Brooklyn.

1277
01:49:39,874 --> 01:49:42,205
I got a little bro
who calls me Sonic.

1278
01:49:42,206 --> 01:49:45,538
And if I gotta help save the universe
in order to save the people I love,

1279
01:49:45,539 --> 01:49:47,574
well, then that‘s what
I‘m gonna do.

1280
01:50:18,242 --> 01:50:19,539
How you doing, sir?

1281
01:50:19,540 --> 01:50:21,915
Um, I‘m here
for the job interview?

1282
01:50:21,916 --> 01:50:23,213
Noah Diaz.

1283
01:50:23,214 --> 01:50:24,820
I‘ll tell ‘em you‘re here.

1284
01:50:26,921 --> 01:50:28,724
60 Minutes,

1285
01:50:28,725 --> 01:50:31,617
I sit down to talk
with Elena Wallace.

1286
01:50:31,618 --> 01:50:36,589
She recently discovered an underground
temple with a network of catacombs...

1287
01:50:36,590 --> 01:50:39,427
dating back to 5000 BC.

1288
01:50:39,428 --> 01:50:43,101
I never could‘ve imagined making
a discovery of this significance.

1289
01:50:43,102 --> 01:50:45,874
So it‘s definitely
a dream come true.

1290
01:50:47,238 --> 01:50:48,744
Brooklyn, baby.

1291
01:50:48,745 --> 01:50:50,845
They‘re ready for you.

1292
01:50:50,846 --> 01:50:52,881
Thank you, sir.
Elevator in the back.

1293
01:50:57,952 --> 01:51:00,217
Why don‘t you tell me
about your strengths?

1294
01:51:00,218 --> 01:51:02,483
In addition to my
experience with electronics,

1295
01:51:02,484 --> 01:51:06,224
I‘ve also been really developing
my team-building skills too.

1296
01:51:07,896 --> 01:51:09,556
Is that so?

1297
01:51:09,557 --> 01:51:12,526
Look, I‘m gonna
be honest with you.

1298
01:51:12,527 --> 01:51:15,001
Résumé‘s a little thin.

1299
01:51:15,002 --> 01:51:17,708
Yeah, well,
I just recently had a job

1300
01:51:18,368 --> 01:51:20,501
working internationally.

1301
01:51:20,502 --> 01:51:21,976
Oh, was that...

1302
01:51:23,879 --> 01:51:26,111
No, I don‘t think it‘s on here.

1303
01:51:26,112 --> 01:51:28,850
No, it was...
it was a short-term contract.

1304
01:51:28,851 --> 01:51:31,644
Oh, well, that‘s cool.

1305
01:51:31,645 --> 01:51:33,383
Why don‘t you tell me
about that?

1306
01:51:36,760 --> 01:51:40,521
It was in South America.
So I got to work on my Spanish.

1307
01:51:40,522 --> 01:51:42,193
My mom was real happy
about that.

1308
01:51:42,194 --> 01:51:44,492
You know what I‘m saying?
You know moms.

1309
01:51:44,493 --> 01:51:47,330
She‘s just really... But while
I was out there, honestly, man,

1310
01:51:47,331 --> 01:51:50,333
it was really just like
work, work, work, you know?

1311
01:51:50,334 --> 01:51:54,173
Ah. That‘s a shame, because I hear
the food is really good in Peru.

1312
01:51:56,670 --> 01:51:59,177
Wait, I didn‘t... I didn‘t
mention anything about Peru.

1313
01:51:59,178 --> 01:52:01,509
Well, that‘s where
you were, right?

1314
01:52:01,510 --> 01:52:03,984
I was... Down in Cusco?

1315
01:52:03,985 --> 01:52:06,922
With you and, uh, Elena

1316
01:52:07,615 --> 01:52:09,352
and your, um,

1317
01:52:09,353 --> 01:52:11,289
I don‘t know, call ‘em friends?

1318
01:52:14,798 --> 01:52:16,722
What...

1319
01:52:16,723 --> 01:52:18,691
What‘s going on in here?

1320
01:52:18,692 --> 01:52:21,199
We know a lot
about you, Mr. Diaz.

1321
01:52:21,200 --> 01:52:24,807
Who are you?
The CIA or FBI or...

1322
01:52:24,808 --> 01:52:27,843
We are a secret
government organization.

1323
01:52:27,844 --> 01:52:29,570
Strictly off the books.

1324
01:52:29,571 --> 01:52:31,407
We specialize in global threats.

1325
01:52:31,408 --> 01:52:34,410
Planetary loss prevention,
that kind of thing.

1326
01:52:34,411 --> 01:52:37,611
We‘re in the middle
of an ongoing war,

1327
01:52:37,612 --> 01:52:39,789
and we‘d love
to have you join the fight.

1328
01:52:39,790 --> 01:52:41,748
You and your whole team.

1329
01:52:42,353 --> 01:52:43,453
You know,

1330
01:52:44,894 --> 01:52:46,191
the big guys.

1331
01:52:46,192 --> 01:52:48,095
No idea what
you‘re talking about.

1332
01:52:49,723 --> 01:52:51,526
That‘s a good answer.

1333
01:52:51,527 --> 01:52:52,967
All right.

1334
01:52:52,968 --> 01:52:55,695
Either way, I want you to know,

1335
01:52:55,696 --> 01:52:58,104
in lieu of the thanks
of a grateful nation,

1336
01:52:58,105 --> 01:53:01,206
we will be taking care of your
brother Kris‘s health care.

1337
01:53:01,207 --> 01:53:02,438
All of it.

1338
01:53:02,439 --> 01:53:05,111
From now on,
he will have 24/7 access

1339
01:53:05,112 --> 01:53:07,311
to the greatest doctors
in the world.

1340
01:53:07,312 --> 01:53:10,744
And these are doctors who don‘t ask
their patients about account balances.

1341
01:53:15,617 --> 01:53:17,288
Are you serious?

1342
01:53:17,289 --> 01:53:19,928
You saved the world, kid.
It‘s the least we can do.

1343
01:53:19,929 --> 01:53:21,622
I don‘t know what to say.

1344
01:53:21,623 --> 01:53:23,526
We‘ll work on that.

1345
01:53:25,099 --> 01:53:27,134
Your brother‘s
gonna be just fine.

1346
01:53:32,799 --> 01:53:34,437
Oh.

1347
01:53:34,438 --> 01:53:36,374
Kris was right, by the way.

1348
01:53:45,812 --> 01:53:47,484
No names over the airwaves.

1349
01:53:49,057 --> 01:53:51,619
We could really use
someone like you, Noah.

1350
01:53:51,620 --> 01:53:54,029
Why don‘t you think about it?

1351
01:54:16,216 --> 01:54:17,679
"G.I. Joe"?

1352
01:54:55,156 --> 01:54:58,653
Come on, baby,
show me some. Show me some.

1353
01:54:58,654 --> 01:55:00,127
That oughta do it.

1354
01:55:00,128 --> 01:55:03,889
This?

1355
01:55:03,890 --> 01:55:07,695
This is a complete waste of
your skills and my expertise.

1356
01:55:07,696 --> 01:55:09,368
Think it came out pretty good.

1357
01:55:10,732 --> 01:55:13,239
Well, I guess
we could call it modern art

1358
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:15,505
and sell it
to some cats in SoHo.

1359
01:55:15,506 --> 01:55:16,737
Nah, I‘m not selling.

1360
01:55:16,738 --> 01:55:17,838
What?

1361
01:55:18,509 --> 01:55:19,609
Why?

1362
01:55:20,907 --> 01:55:22,612
Is this about the 5-0 thing?

1363
01:55:23,547 --> 01:55:26,285
No. I told you,
I did not ditch you!

1364
01:55:26,286 --> 01:55:29,057
I was running the give-and-go.
I thought you knew the play!

1365
01:55:29,058 --> 01:55:32,423
All right, let‘s say I did
ditch you, even though I didn‘t.

1366
01:55:32,424 --> 01:55:34,920
For your sake... I see your face...
let‘s just say I did.

1367
01:55:34,921 --> 01:55:37,131
I think all the blood,
sweat and dead presidents

1368
01:55:37,132 --> 01:55:40,431
I put into getting these car
parts for you make us even steven.

1369
01:55:40,432 --> 01:55:42,367
It‘s not that.

1370
01:55:42,368 --> 01:55:44,270
This car is special.

1371
01:55:44,271 --> 01:55:47,768
This car is a jigsaw puzzle
made of garbage!

1372
01:55:47,769 --> 01:55:52,246
Hey, I bet the joint
don‘t even start.

1373
01:55:54,710 --> 01:55:55,909
Bet?

1374
01:55:57,218 --> 01:55:58,615
Yo, Mirage.

1375
01:56:08,229 --> 01:56:09,592
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1376
01:56:09,593 --> 01:56:13,167
Yeah!
Your boy is back!

1377
01:56:13,168 --> 01:56:15,533
This dude said
I wasn‘t even gonna start!
