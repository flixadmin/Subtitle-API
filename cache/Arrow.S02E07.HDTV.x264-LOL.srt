1
00:00:01,334 --> 00:00:03,436
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,054 --> 00:00:06,888
After five years
on a hellish island,

3
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,441
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:09,943 --> 00:00:12,360
to save my city.

5
00:00:12,362 --> 00:00:17,365
But to do so, I can't
be the killer I once was.

6
00:00:17,367 --> 00:00:19,517
To honor
my friend's memory,

7
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,487
I must be someone else.

8
00:00:22,489 --> 00:00:26,692
I must be something else.

9
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:28,326
Previously on "Arrow"...

10
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:29,694
This one's no longer
of use to us.

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,496
Wait. He could
still be useful.

12
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:33,915
She's right. Once we
get rid of his friends,

13
00:00:33,917 --> 00:00:36,084
we'll need him to lead us
to the grave.

14
00:00:36,086 --> 00:00:37,636
You're going back
to the island.

15
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:39,638
Look, you already
lost your dad.

16
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,374
Your mom, she's still here. And
I'm sure she'd love to see you.

17
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:44,226
I'm not going to that prison.

18
00:00:44,228 --> 00:00:46,311
It's the only way
I know how to hurt her.

19
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:49,097
And I want to hate you.

20
00:00:49,099 --> 00:00:51,383
But I can't.

21
00:00:52,885 --> 00:00:54,803
I didn't think that there were
secrets kept between us.

22
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:57,722
Mom...what
are you hiding?

23
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:02,944
My name
is Moira Dearden Queen.

24
00:01:02,946 --> 00:01:06,782
I am the acting CEO
of Queen Consolidated.

25
00:01:06,784 --> 00:01:10,252
And, God forgive me,
I have failed this city.

26
00:01:10,254 --> 00:01:13,455
I have been complicit
in an undertaking

27
00:01:13,457 --> 00:01:16,041
with one horrible purpose--

28
00:01:18,628 --> 00:01:22,464
to destroy the Glades
and everyone in it.

29
00:01:22,466 --> 00:01:24,516
If you reside in the Glades,

30
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:27,135
please, you need
to get out now.

31
00:01:27,137 --> 00:01:30,305
Your lives and the lives
of your children depend on it.

32
00:01:30,307 --> 00:01:32,557
Please.

33
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:36,194
Warden says we got
to evacuate.

34
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,596
Help me get these out of here.

35
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:41,432
What about the inmates?
Leave 'em.

36
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:20,272
Huh?

37
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:25,277
Hmm.

38
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:30,315
Ahh.

39
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:31,583
Over here, let me out.
No.

40
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:34,619
Give me the keys!
No, no, too violent.

41
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:37,706
Take me!
Sloppy, too stupid.

42
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:40,926
Too...ambitious.

43
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:43,261
You.

44
00:02:43,263 --> 00:02:45,213
I love your work.

45
00:02:45,215 --> 00:02:47,265
Big future.

46
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,633
Hey, be careful.

47
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:51,002
There's liable
to be aftershocks.

48
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,555
Oh, I'm counting on it.

49
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:16,125

51
00:03:28,641 --> 00:03:30,875
Mr. Queen, what are
your mother's chances?

52
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:34,095
Is she on suicide watch?

53
00:03:34,097 --> 00:03:36,180
Mr. Queen, can you
give us any comment?

54
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:38,483
It's not fair.
They're not the ones on trial.

55
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:41,602
That won't stop Jean Loring from using
them as props to drum up sympathy.

56
00:03:41,604 --> 00:03:43,488
You don't seem
overly concerned.

57
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:46,407
She confessed to being an accomplice
on live television.

58
00:03:46,409 --> 00:03:48,826
Also sad that
Malcolm Merlyn coerced here.

59
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:52,780
You have something, don't you?

60
00:03:52,782 --> 00:03:55,249
I thought I was
your co-counsel, Adam.

61
00:03:55,251 --> 00:03:56,241
If you're holding a trump card,

62
00:03:56,266 --> 00:03:57,870
don't you think maybe
you should share it with me?

63
00:03:57,871 --> 00:03:59,921
It's going to be
a good trial.

64
00:03:59,923 --> 00:04:03,207
Come on,
let's get inside.

65
00:04:11,683 --> 00:04:13,384
You don't
have to do this.

66
00:04:13,386 --> 00:04:15,136
Ivo says we do.

67
00:04:15,138 --> 00:04:16,587
Your friends are
a danger to his men.

68
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,222
Go. Quick and quiet.

69
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,057
Slade! Shado! Run!

70
00:04:33,238 --> 00:04:34,872
There's no one here.

71
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:39,827
They must have moved on
from their position.

72
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:41,629
Chargers are placed.
Here's the detonator.

73
00:04:41,631 --> 00:04:44,281
Make sure they have
no place to return to.

74
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:46,250
Go.

75
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:49,136
And you.

76
00:04:49,138 --> 00:04:50,922
Now you're going to take us
to the graves.

77
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:53,257
Let's go. Get him up.

78
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,762
Let's get clear.

79
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:02,850
Did you find
the detonator?

80
00:05:02,852 --> 00:05:04,969
Yes.

81
00:05:06,856 --> 00:05:08,573
We were lucky.

82
00:05:08,575 --> 00:05:12,026
I was lucky.
You were good.

83
00:05:12,028 --> 00:05:13,945
Either way...

84
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:15,646
They have Oliver.

85
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:18,032
I'm going after him.

86
00:05:18,034 --> 00:05:20,150
Not alone.

87
00:05:20,152 --> 00:05:23,037
You can barely walk.

88
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,289
All the more
reason not to stay here.

89
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:28,626
Give them another chance
at blowing me up.

90
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:35,933
Are you two ok?

91
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:37,768
I should be asking
you that question.

92
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:38,853
I'll be fine.

93
00:05:38,855 --> 00:05:40,888
You look like
you have the flu.

94
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,940
If that's true, I shouldn't have
wasted my time getting vaccinated.

95
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:45,309
Diggle, whatever
it is, just go home.

96
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:47,562
Oliver, listen,
I can take care of things.

97
00:05:47,564 --> 00:05:49,614
No, we'll be fine,
all right?

98
00:05:49,616 --> 00:05:51,532
Go rest. And don't
make me call a cop.

99
00:05:51,534 --> 00:05:55,019
There are a few
of them around here.

100
00:06:20,245 --> 00:06:23,047
...have been complicit
in an undertaking

101
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,816
with one horrible purpose--

102
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:30,104
to destroy the Glades
and everyone in it.

103
00:06:30,106 --> 00:06:32,573
And it worked.
The Glades were destroyed.

104
00:06:32,575 --> 00:06:34,809
Homes and lives
were lost.

105
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,944
All because
of her actions.

106
00:06:36,946 --> 00:06:39,413
True, she had second thoughts;
Remorse which

107
00:06:39,415 --> 00:06:42,350
compelled her
to deliver this statement.

108
00:06:42,352 --> 00:06:44,535
But on behalf
of the 503 lives

109
00:06:44,537 --> 00:06:46,871
that were
extinguished that day,

110
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:50,491
I say, Moira Queen,
your remorse comes too late.

111
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,710
For the last five years,

112
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,845
under the threat
for my life

113
00:06:54,847 --> 00:06:56,547
and the lives
of my family...

114
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:59,517
Why wouldn't those
threats silence her?

115
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,803
Why wouldn't
Moira Queen be terrified?

116
00:07:02,805 --> 00:07:05,523
Malcolm Merlyn killed
her first husband,

117
00:07:05,525 --> 00:07:06,425
abducted her second.

118
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,329
Why wouldn't she be
in fear for her life?

119
00:07:08,861 --> 00:07:11,479
For the lives
of her children?

120
00:07:11,481 --> 00:07:14,031
What would you do?

121
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,067
If it were your children
in the crosshairs

122
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:18,402
of a mad man's rage?

123
00:07:21,289 --> 00:07:24,125
S.T.A.R. Lab's
particle accelerator

124
00:07:24,127 --> 00:07:26,460
will be turned on
right on schedule.

125
00:07:26,462 --> 00:07:28,329
In other news,
we have just received word

126
00:07:28,331 --> 00:07:30,915
that both sides have now completed
their opening statements

127
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,050
in the Moira Queen trial.

128
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:34,969
Don't take this the wrong way,
but you look disgusting.

129
00:07:34,971 --> 00:07:36,971
Yeah, well, I don't
feel great, Felicity.

130
00:07:36,973 --> 00:07:39,890
Is there a right way
to take that?

131
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:41,342
You should go home.

132
00:07:41,344 --> 00:07:43,344
I am going.

133
00:07:43,346 --> 00:07:45,963
I just need to make arrangements
for a replacement bodyguard.

134
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,816
Did you get the flu shot?
Personally, I never do.

135
00:07:48,818 --> 00:07:51,936
I know that I should.
I just, I have this thing about needles.

136
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:53,738
All pointy things,
really.

137
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,823
Which is ironic, considering
who we work with.

138
00:07:55,825 --> 00:07:58,075
Yeah, it's not the flu,
Felicity, it's more like...

139
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:00,528
Dig!

140
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:03,698
Hello?

141
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,000
Are you here?

142
00:08:06,002 --> 00:08:08,953
Here...there...

143
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,038
everywhere.

144
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,790
So.

145
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:15,126
How goes our little
science project?

146
00:08:15,128 --> 00:08:17,327
Working like
you said it would.

147
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:19,296
How wonderful.

148
00:08:19,298 --> 00:08:21,165
Ah, so listen.

149
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,301
Doing the thing was 50,000.

150
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,303
Keeping quiet about it,

151
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:28,505
I'm thinking
it should be 50 more.

152
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:29,890
Hmm.

153
00:08:29,892 --> 00:08:32,059
Oh, I want word
to spread.

154
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:35,312
It's kind of the whole
objective, actually.

155
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:38,115
You see my point?

156
00:08:40,403 --> 00:08:43,954
You should know,
I find post hoc negotiation...

157
00:08:43,956 --> 00:08:46,190
distasteful.

158
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,992
Ahh.

159
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,827
Such a shame
you won't get to see

160
00:08:49,829 --> 00:08:52,213
what your works have
wrought, doctor.

161
00:08:52,215 --> 00:08:55,750
But soon,
everyone else will.

162
00:08:55,752 --> 00:09:00,421
And they'll beg for it to end.

163
00:09:10,112 --> 00:09:11,253
What the hell
are you doing here?

164
00:09:11,254 --> 00:09:12,242
I heard you
passed out.

165
00:09:12,243 --> 00:09:13,826
I told Felicity
not to call you.

166
00:09:13,828 --> 00:09:15,328
Yeah, but before that,
you said "gaw" and "thud,"

167
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,046
so I didn't take it
very seriously.

168
00:09:17,048 --> 00:09:19,215
She was right to call me. Diggle,
you need medical attention.

169
00:09:19,217 --> 00:09:21,501
He needs more than that.
When Dig passed out,

170
00:09:21,503 --> 00:09:23,336
I sent a sample of his blood
to a chemist I know at QC.

171
00:09:23,338 --> 00:09:25,671
The guy owes me a favor.
Long story, I fixed his parking ticket.

172
00:09:25,673 --> 00:09:27,723
Huh. I guess it's not that long.

173
00:09:27,725 --> 00:09:30,560
Felicity.
The blood sample.

174
00:09:30,562 --> 00:09:33,563
Yeah. It came back positive--
for trace amounts of Vertigo.

175
00:09:33,565 --> 00:09:34,680
I never used Vertigo
before in my life.

176
00:09:34,682 --> 00:09:36,482
You were exposed
to it somehow.

177
00:09:36,484 --> 00:09:37,967
Vertigo's
in play again?

178
00:09:37,969 --> 00:09:39,652
When the Count recovered

179
00:09:39,654 --> 00:09:41,254
from his OD on Vertigo,
he was sent to Iron Heights.

180
00:09:41,256 --> 00:09:44,023
That got hit
in the quake.

181
00:09:44,025 --> 00:09:46,475
He got out the same way
the Doll Maker did?

182
00:09:46,477 --> 00:09:49,278
And just like
with the Doll Maker,

183
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:53,482
prison officials worked overtime
to keep the lid on the escape.

184
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:58,320
I know what you're thinking.
No, you don't.

185
00:09:58,322 --> 00:10:00,706
I made a choice not to put
an arrow in this guy.

186
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:03,509
And it was
the right choice.

187
00:10:03,511 --> 00:10:06,345
There's no more
killing.

188
00:10:06,347 --> 00:10:08,664
I worked this up to counteract
the effects of Vertigo.

189
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:09,849
Give it to Diggle. I...

190
00:10:09,851 --> 00:10:12,051
I need to get back
to court.

191
00:10:12,053 --> 00:10:14,169
While I'm gone,
just work up whatever you can

192
00:10:14,171 --> 00:10:17,306
and figure out how Diggle got Vertigo
in his system without his knowledge.

193
00:10:17,608 --> 00:10:19,975
Ok. Go.

194
00:10:22,012 --> 00:10:25,898
When was the first time you heard
about this so-called Undertaking?

195
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,955
When everyone else did,

196
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,123
when my mother gave
the press conference.

197
00:10:30,288 --> 00:10:32,087
Doesn't seem like
you took it too well.

198
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,639
I was surprised.

199
00:10:33,641 --> 00:10:37,042
Who wouldn't be?

200
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:42,715
Uh, your mother was, um,
immediately take into custody,

201
00:10:42,717 --> 00:10:45,434
but I assume you went down
to the precinct to see her?

202
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:48,670
Um, actually I didn't see her
until she was moved.

203
00:10:48,672 --> 00:10:50,556
To the prison.

204
00:10:50,558 --> 00:10:53,509
Do you remember when
you visited her?

205
00:10:53,511 --> 00:10:54,810
Uh, not the exact date.

206
00:10:54,812 --> 00:10:58,797
It's ok, I have
the visitor log here.

207
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,349
October ninth.

208
00:11:00,351 --> 00:11:02,618
Five months later.

209
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,353
Why so long?

210
00:11:04,355 --> 00:11:07,356
Um, I--I...

211
00:11:07,358 --> 00:11:09,825
Are you ok?

212
00:11:11,027 --> 00:11:12,795
An answer, please.

213
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,381
Why did it take you
five months to visit your mother?

214
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,483
Your Honor, if I--
No.

215
00:11:17,485 --> 00:11:19,752
I want to hear this.

216
00:11:19,754 --> 00:11:21,337
I needed time.

217
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:22,955
I was...

218
00:11:22,957 --> 00:11:25,758
Angry. So angry, perhaps,

219
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,211
that it took you
five months to forgive her?

220
00:11:29,213 --> 00:11:30,930
It was complicated.

221
00:11:30,932 --> 00:11:33,649
No. It's very simple.

222
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:37,219
You blamed your mother
for what she had done.

223
00:11:37,221 --> 00:11:39,855
So why shouldn't the jury?

224
00:11:42,442 --> 00:11:44,777
Your Honor, we have
no further questions

225
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:47,396
for the...witness.

226
00:11:50,733 --> 00:11:53,285
Adam!

227
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,427
Where is it?

228
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,179
Come on,
where is it?!

229
00:12:05,682 --> 00:12:07,633
The Hosen, where is it?

230
00:12:07,635 --> 00:12:08,968
What?

231
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,469
The arrowhead.

232
00:12:10,471 --> 00:12:12,638
Every report said it was
with these bodies.

233
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,056
You said you
and your friends were here.

234
00:12:14,058 --> 00:12:16,942
Now, where is it?

235
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,361
Take him outside.

236
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:22,982
Make him show you
where his friends are hiding.

237
00:12:27,405 --> 00:12:28,871
Take us to them.

238
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:31,874
I don't know
where they are!

239
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:33,125
Oww!

240
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,994
Tell me,
or you lose your hand.

241
00:12:34,996 --> 00:12:36,879
Let us suggest
another option.

242
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:40,782
You hand the kid over to us,
and we don't kill you all.

243
00:12:50,894 --> 00:12:53,145
Hey, are you ok?

244
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:57,349
Don't worry about me.
I can take it.

245
00:13:15,335 --> 00:13:17,836
Was that as bad
as it seemed?

246
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:20,456
Thea's testimony?
It was a set-back.

247
00:13:20,458 --> 00:13:22,791
We were counting on her to--

248
00:13:22,793 --> 00:13:24,176
Humanize me.

249
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,928
Frankly, yes.

250
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,963
And now we're going to have
to go another way.

251
00:13:27,965 --> 00:13:30,299
No. No, I told you,
I won't testify.

252
00:13:30,301 --> 00:13:32,334
I know you did.
But now you have to.

253
00:13:32,336 --> 00:13:35,437
She's right, Mom.

254
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:38,140
Jean, can you
give us a minute?

255
00:13:38,142 --> 00:13:39,808
Yeah.

256
00:13:43,313 --> 00:13:45,564
I know what
you're going to say.

257
00:13:45,566 --> 00:13:48,984
But if I testify,
it will destroy our family.

258
00:13:48,986 --> 00:13:52,538
And if your lawyer's right,
you don't have a choice.

259
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,324
Mom, secrets are what
put you in this situation.

260
00:13:55,326 --> 00:13:58,577
Secrets and lies.

261
00:13:59,829 --> 00:14:02,281
And now it is time

262
00:14:02,283 --> 00:14:04,983
to give the truth its day.

263
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:08,837
Now, I don't want us
to lose sight

264
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:10,973
of the other major
event in court today.

265
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:13,592
Was there any indication
of Adam Donner being ill?

266
00:14:13,594 --> 00:14:16,745
No, there was very little
warning before Mr. Donner

267
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:17,731
collapsed to the ground.

268
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:20,682
I've spoken to several people that were
in the courtroom with me...

269
00:14:20,684 --> 00:14:23,602
How are you feeling?

270
00:14:23,604 --> 00:14:24,987
Fine.

271
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,438
You have a lousy
poker face, Diggle.

272
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,240
Did he take the antidote?

273
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,409
Didn't work. The Count
must have futzed with his recipe.

274
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:31,860
Heard what happened
with Donner

275
00:14:31,862 --> 00:14:33,662
at the court,
and with Thea.

276
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,397
How is she?

277
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,232
Going to be fine.

278
00:14:37,234 --> 00:14:39,901
Your poker face isn't much better
than mine, Oliver.

279
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:44,506
Hello, Starling City.
Felicity!

280
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:47,009
Miss me?

281
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,678
Many of you have noticed that you're
not feeling quite like yourselves...

282
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,630
He's taken over
all the local station feeds.

283
00:14:51,632 --> 00:14:53,549
Track his signal.

284
00:14:53,551 --> 00:14:55,384
Like our good assistant
district attorney here.

285
00:14:55,386 --> 00:14:56,935
You might recognize him
from his work

286
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:59,555
in the ongoing
Moira Queen trial.

287
00:14:59,557 --> 00:15:02,224
Hi, Adam.
What do you want?

288
00:15:02,226 --> 00:15:04,226
I want what you want.

289
00:15:04,228 --> 00:15:06,428
For you to feel better.

290
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,231
Go to hell!

291
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:11,733
I do think you want
the pain to end,

292
00:15:11,735 --> 00:15:13,902
and I can do that...

293
00:15:13,904 --> 00:15:16,038
With Vertigo.

294
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,625
It's what all of
your bodies crave.

295
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,861
Fortunately, the power
of relief is right here.

296
00:15:22,863 --> 00:15:24,663
And all you have
to do is go to your friendly

297
00:15:24,665 --> 00:15:27,299
neighborhood Vertigo
dealer and request the cure.

298
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,551
Simply supply
and demand at work.

299
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:32,671
Now, tell me
you want this

300
00:15:32,673 --> 00:15:34,890
and it's yours.

301
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:39,094
All the pain will
just...disappear.

302
00:15:40,513 --> 00:15:42,598
Say it.

303
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,566
Say...

304
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:45,734
You want it.

305
00:15:49,939 --> 00:15:53,141
I-I--want--I want it.

306
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,951
You see...a simple solution.

307
00:16:02,953 --> 00:16:05,037
I'm Count Vertigo,

308
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:07,822
and I approve this high.

309
00:16:10,326 --> 00:16:13,045
What do we do now?

310
00:16:13,047 --> 00:16:15,297
We find him...

311
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:18,500
And we shut him down.

312
00:16:26,385 --> 00:16:27,912
Where did he
broadcast from?

313
00:16:27,913 --> 00:16:30,080
He bounced the signal off
of S.T.A.R. Lab's satellite.

314
00:16:30,082 --> 00:16:31,798
He could have sent that
transmission from Markovia.

315
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,333
He would want
to stay local.

316
00:16:33,335 --> 00:16:35,218
Scrub the footage,
frame by frame if you have to.

317
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,754
There's something
on here that gives us a clue

318
00:16:37,756 --> 00:16:39,389
to where he is.
If he dosed the whole city,

319
00:16:39,391 --> 00:16:41,057
why are only some people
showing symptoms?

320
00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:42,676
Maybe exposure
was selective.

321
00:16:42,678 --> 00:16:44,477
The Count contaminated
something that only certain people,

322
00:16:44,479 --> 00:16:46,680
like you and Donner,
consumed.

323
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:50,567
A most dramatic turn.

324
00:16:50,569 --> 00:16:52,686
City officials are urging calm,

325
00:16:52,688 --> 00:16:54,804
hoping to avoid
widespread panic.

326
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:56,489
Deputy Mayor Levitz has...

327
00:16:56,491 --> 00:17:00,193
The Count has turned
Starling into a city of junkies.

328
00:17:00,195 --> 00:17:02,779
Any leads on where
he's holding ADA Donner?

329
00:17:02,781 --> 00:17:07,300
Hmm, no. As cold as it sounds,
I've got other concerns.

330
00:17:07,302 --> 00:17:08,618
Laurel?

331
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,370
Adam's trial notes
are very thorough.

332
00:17:10,372 --> 00:17:12,706
They better be.
You're lead counsel now.

333
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:15,175
Ms. Spencer,
you're the district attorney.

334
00:17:15,177 --> 00:17:18,595
Yes, but you're the one
that the jury knows.

335
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:24,434
You'll do fine, Laurel.

336
00:17:24,436 --> 00:17:26,736
I know.

337
00:17:26,738 --> 00:17:29,606
I just found
Adam's trump card.

338
00:17:32,727 --> 00:17:37,113
♪ Sneaking cigarettes
at lunchtime ♪

339
00:17:37,115 --> 00:17:40,984
♪ sun feels safe

340
00:17:40,986 --> 00:17:43,753
Sorry, I didn't hear you walk up.

341
00:17:43,755 --> 00:17:45,821
I just want to be
left alone.

342
00:17:45,823 --> 00:17:47,924
Well, too bad that's not
an option for you.

343
00:17:47,926 --> 00:17:49,959
But maybe I know
something that is.

344
00:17:55,299 --> 00:17:57,300
Hit me.

345
00:17:57,302 --> 00:17:58,885
What?

346
00:18:01,639 --> 00:18:03,556
You wonder why I used
to go out at night

347
00:18:03,558 --> 00:18:05,808
looking to throw down
with bad guys.

348
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:08,644
Part of it was to help the city.

349
00:18:08,646 --> 00:18:10,930
And the other part

350
00:18:10,932 --> 00:18:13,232
was to help me.

351
00:18:13,234 --> 00:18:15,985
Getting tuned up
by street thugs helped you?

352
00:18:15,987 --> 00:18:18,854
Yeah, well, I gave
as good as I got.

353
00:18:18,856 --> 00:18:21,374
There we go.

354
00:18:21,376 --> 00:18:24,994
When I would throw a punch,
I'd be so angry.

355
00:18:24,996 --> 00:18:27,814
I'd feel this heat
rising inside of me,

356
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:30,450
in my jaw. In my chest.

357
00:18:30,452 --> 00:18:32,618
And my fists.

358
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:37,507
But I needed
somewhere to go.

359
00:18:37,509 --> 00:18:40,009
Come on.

360
00:18:44,014 --> 00:18:47,216
Thea, you're angry.

361
00:18:47,218 --> 00:18:50,353
At your mother, the D.A.,
yourself, maybe.

362
00:18:50,355 --> 00:18:51,838
But that anger is going
to chew up your insides

363
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,556
if you don't
let it out.

364
00:18:53,558 --> 00:18:56,109
I'm not going to hit you, Roy.

365
00:18:56,111 --> 00:18:57,827
Try.

366
00:18:57,829 --> 00:19:00,229
Try!

367
00:19:01,915 --> 00:19:05,118
I said hit me, right? 'Cause
that felt like--

368
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,921
that didn't really
feel like anything.

369
00:19:08,923 --> 00:19:12,041
Better. But keep
your wrists straight.

370
00:19:12,043 --> 00:19:13,292
Don't just use your arm.

371
00:19:13,294 --> 00:19:15,344
Put your entire body
into it.

372
00:19:17,297 --> 00:19:20,082
Come on, again.

373
00:19:42,372 --> 00:19:44,824
At least let me
call Lyla.

374
00:19:44,826 --> 00:19:46,659
All she could do
is worry about me.

375
00:19:46,661 --> 00:19:48,161
I found something.

376
00:19:48,163 --> 00:19:49,495
I don't see anything.

377
00:19:49,497 --> 00:19:53,166
Because you have
to see what Donner does.

378
00:19:53,168 --> 00:19:55,168
His eye caught
a reflection.

379
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,552
Can you enhance?

380
00:19:56,554 --> 00:19:59,422
It hurts me that you
feel a need to ask.

381
00:19:59,424 --> 00:20:01,641
What are those,
wings?

382
00:20:01,643 --> 00:20:03,059
It's the city seal.

383
00:20:03,061 --> 00:20:04,560
Starling Municipal
Records department.

384
00:20:04,562 --> 00:20:06,128
That building's
been abandoned

385
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:07,763
since the city went to digital.
Dollars to donuts,

386
00:20:07,765 --> 00:20:09,682
that's where
is operating out of.

387
00:20:09,684 --> 00:20:11,901
Not for long.

388
00:20:18,442 --> 00:20:21,410
You shouldn't be here.

389
00:20:21,412 --> 00:20:23,079
My attorney needs...
Moira.

390
00:20:23,081 --> 00:20:26,732
I know I could be disbarred
for speaking with you,

391
00:20:26,734 --> 00:20:28,985
but this isn't something
for lawyers.

392
00:20:28,987 --> 00:20:31,820
This is a family matter.

393
00:20:41,014 --> 00:20:44,967
Jean told me she's calling you
to the stand tomorrow.

394
00:20:47,671 --> 00:20:49,772
Yes.

395
00:20:49,774 --> 00:20:51,841
You can't testify.

396
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,394
Well.

397
00:20:55,396 --> 00:20:57,713
The fact that you don't want
me to, Laurel,

398
00:20:57,715 --> 00:20:59,532
is a good indication
that I should.

399
00:20:59,534 --> 00:21:02,201
If you take the stand,
I'll have to cross examine you,

400
00:21:02,203 --> 00:21:04,220
and I'll have to do it
to the best of my ability.

401
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:07,156
Yes, I understand.
No, I don't think you do.

402
00:21:18,886 --> 00:21:22,722
Forget about what
this will do to Oliver and Thea.

403
00:21:22,724 --> 00:21:26,142
It also could undermine
your entire case.

404
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:30,146
So, Moira, please.

405
00:21:30,148 --> 00:21:31,764
Please.

406
00:21:31,766 --> 00:21:33,549
Don't make me use this.

407
00:21:33,551 --> 00:21:37,737
Everything is at stake for you.

408
00:21:37,739 --> 00:21:40,039
And I don't want
to be the one to take it all away.

409
00:21:44,328 --> 00:21:46,112
Faster, please.

410
00:21:46,114 --> 00:21:49,898
Faster! We have a city
full of customers.

411
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,451
And I mean this literally.

412
00:21:52,453 --> 00:21:55,421
I'm afraid my production apparatus
is a little over-taxed

413
00:21:55,423 --> 00:21:58,207
with the increased demand.
I can live with it, though.

414
00:21:58,209 --> 00:22:00,843
I can't say
the city can.

415
00:22:02,245 --> 00:22:04,180
Go.

416
00:22:04,182 --> 00:22:06,549
Be still, my heart.

417
00:22:17,027 --> 00:22:19,278
Step away from them.

418
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,448
Yes, I've heard you've developed
an allergy to killing.

419
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:24,867
Do it!
Or what?

420
00:22:24,869 --> 00:22:27,603
You'll kill me?

421
00:22:46,256 --> 00:22:48,341
You're really on
the no killing wagon?

422
00:22:48,343 --> 00:22:50,309
Shame.

423
00:22:50,311 --> 00:22:53,562
Really letting one of life's true
pleasures pass you by.

424
00:23:00,395 --> 00:23:04,615
But you said you didn't want
to testify.

425
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:07,618
But you have to.

426
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,004
Because of me.
No.

427
00:23:10,006 --> 00:23:11,171
You have to do
damage control.

428
00:23:11,173 --> 00:23:12,623
None of this is your fault.

429
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,842
We're here because
of what I did.

430
00:23:16,678 --> 00:23:17,928
Now, you both
know the truth,

431
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,180
but you don't know
all of it.

432
00:23:20,182 --> 00:23:22,299
Laurel does.

433
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:24,568
What does she have?

434
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,890
You shouldn't have
to find this out in court.

435
00:23:29,892 --> 00:23:31,842
Find out what?

436
00:23:34,863 --> 00:23:39,433
Years ago--
it was many yes ago...

437
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:45,155
Your father
was engaging in his--

438
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:49,159
his extramarital activities.

439
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:53,080
And I had a moment of weakness.

440
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:59,186
I cheated on him.

441
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:01,205
With Malcolm Merlyn.

442
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,461
No.

443
00:24:07,463 --> 00:24:10,447
No, I--

444
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,933
I asked you about this.

445
00:24:12,935 --> 00:24:15,636
Last year.

446
00:24:15,638 --> 00:24:18,522
You said that there was nothing
between you two!

447
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:21,108
There wasn't.
Sweetheart, it wasn't an affair.

448
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:23,577
It was very brief,
and a long time ago.

449
00:24:23,579 --> 00:24:26,363
And despite it, you remained
friends with Mr. Merlyn.

450
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:29,416
In fact, he frequently
attended parties at your home.

451
00:24:29,418 --> 00:24:32,953
He was my husband's
best friend until Malcolm killed him.

452
00:24:32,955 --> 00:24:35,089
And this is why
you claimed to feel

453
00:24:35,091 --> 00:24:36,790
as though you were
in fear for your life

454
00:24:36,792 --> 00:24:38,542
and the lives
of your children?

455
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:40,494
Well, I think it's a fairly
compelling reason.

456
00:24:40,496 --> 00:24:42,713
Last year,

457
00:24:42,715 --> 00:24:45,265
your second husband,
Walter Steel,

458
00:24:45,267 --> 00:24:48,769
was abducted by Mr. Merlyn,
is that correct?

459
00:24:48,771 --> 00:24:51,055
Yes. So you so.

460
00:24:51,057 --> 00:24:53,497
Why didn't Merlyn kill Walter,
the same as your first husband?

461
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:58,278
I convinced Malcolm not to.

462
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,148
And Malcolm
listened to you.

463
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:04,618
Your friend spared
Walter's life,

464
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,071
and yet, you'd have
this jury believing

465
00:25:07,073 --> 00:25:08,789
that you and your children
were in danger?

466
00:25:08,791 --> 00:25:10,190
We were. I was afraid--

467
00:25:10,192 --> 00:25:13,077
Afraid of getting caught.

468
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:17,665
Despite whatever youthful
mistakes I might have made,

469
00:25:17,667 --> 00:25:20,867
Malcolm Merlyn
was a dangerous man.

470
00:25:20,869 --> 00:25:22,302
To other people.

471
00:25:22,304 --> 00:25:24,972
But the only person
who truly posed a danger

472
00:25:24,974 --> 00:25:27,130
to Moira Queen
and her family

473
00:25:27,131 --> 00:25:28,931
was Moira Queen.

474
00:25:51,942 --> 00:25:52,459
Hey.

475
00:25:52,484 --> 00:25:54,478
Ok, if you want
to attack me, go right ahead.

476
00:25:54,479 --> 00:25:56,279
But you should know that you're
not going to say anything

477
00:25:56,281 --> 00:25:57,981
that I haven't already
said to myself.

478
00:25:57,983 --> 00:26:00,984
Whoa. I know that that
was difficult for you,

479
00:26:00,986 --> 00:26:03,369
and I just want to make
sure that you're ok.

480
00:26:04,822 --> 00:26:06,706
No, no.

481
00:26:06,708 --> 00:26:09,025
I don't understand
how you can forgive me

482
00:26:09,027 --> 00:26:11,494
after what I just did in there.

483
00:26:12,501 --> 00:26:14,502
I don't understand
how anyone could.

484
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:22,977
So, obviously you three

485
00:26:22,979 --> 00:26:26,213
took the Hosen
out of this cave.

486
00:26:26,215 --> 00:26:28,016
Lift him up.

487
00:26:28,018 --> 00:26:29,817
Now I know
he doesn't have it,

488
00:26:29,819 --> 00:26:31,269
which means
one of you two does.

489
00:26:31,271 --> 00:26:34,155
Give it to me,  and we'll discuss
an exchange.

490
00:26:34,157 --> 00:26:35,656
We don't know
what you're talking about.

491
00:26:35,658 --> 00:26:37,575
Give us Oliver,

492
00:26:37,577 --> 00:26:39,827
and we'll leave you
alone to look for it.

493
00:26:39,829 --> 00:26:40,912
Aah!

494
00:26:40,914 --> 00:26:42,997
Anybody else
want to be stupid?

495
00:26:42,999 --> 00:26:45,700
Hey. Hey!

496
00:26:45,702 --> 00:26:48,036
Fine.
Take 'em.

497
00:26:48,038 --> 00:26:50,671
Cut him loose.

498
00:26:53,709 --> 00:26:55,543
What are you doing?!

499
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,588
We have to keep moving,
they're following us!

500
00:27:18,901 --> 00:27:20,651
Obviously we're
continuing to monitor

501
00:27:20,653 --> 00:27:22,436
both of these
major stories

502
00:27:22,438 --> 00:27:24,872
in what has become a significant
news day here in Starling.

503
00:27:24,874 --> 00:27:26,607
What can you
tell us about--

504
00:27:26,609 --> 00:27:29,544
Oliver's going to be pretty
wrapped up with his mother.

505
00:27:29,546 --> 00:27:31,245
You making any process
on how The Count's

506
00:27:31,247 --> 00:27:32,780
getting Vertigo
into people's systems?

507
00:27:32,782 --> 00:27:34,982
Not much.

508
00:27:34,984 --> 00:27:36,934
Each dot is the home of somebody
with withdrawal symptoms.

509
00:27:36,936 --> 00:27:38,586
That seems pretty random.

510
00:27:38,588 --> 00:27:41,422
That's because
it's very random.

511
00:27:41,424 --> 00:27:43,558
Ok.

512
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,577
What if people
weren't exposed at home;

513
00:27:46,579 --> 00:27:48,513
what if they got dosed at work?

514
00:27:48,515 --> 00:27:51,249
Can you do this
by their employment addresses?

515
00:27:51,251 --> 00:27:52,567
I'm really
starting to wonder

516
00:27:52,569 --> 00:27:54,469
what it would take
to impress you guys.

517
00:27:57,323 --> 00:27:59,574
It's a trail.
A path through the city.

518
00:27:59,576 --> 00:28:01,025
Any place you've been?

519
00:28:01,027 --> 00:28:02,693
59th and Dell, that's where
I got my flu shot.

520
00:28:02,695 --> 00:28:04,912
You got your vaccination
from one of those trucks, right?

521
00:28:04,914 --> 00:28:07,365
One of those roving
flu trucks?

522
00:28:07,367 --> 00:28:09,534
The route.

523
00:28:09,536 --> 00:28:10,928
It's a flu vaccination tour.

524
00:28:10,953 --> 00:28:12,954
A truck sent out by
Starling City Mobile Care.

525
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,923
I got addicted after one injection?
That can happen?

526
00:28:15,925 --> 00:28:17,625
Sure. Try heroin
some time.

527
00:28:17,627 --> 00:28:19,544
Not try...Try.

528
00:28:19,546 --> 00:28:20,962
All right,
where's the truck now?

529
00:28:20,964 --> 00:28:23,548
Downtown.
What do you think?

530
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:25,516
Call Oliver?

531
00:28:25,518 --> 00:28:28,302
No, no, he's busy
with his family. I'll go.

532
00:28:28,304 --> 00:28:30,555
Yeah, no. That's
not happening.

533
00:28:30,557 --> 00:28:31,772
I'll go.

534
00:28:31,774 --> 00:28:34,308
Felicity,
it's too dangerous.

535
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,777
It could turn out to be nothing.
If it's not, I'll call.

536
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:38,946
...courtroom drama
you've just witnessed?

537
00:28:38,948 --> 00:28:41,365
Bethany, no one expected
the turn that testimony took.

538
00:28:41,367 --> 00:28:45,319
A revelation that Moira Queen
once had an affair with Malcolm Merlyn

539
00:28:45,321 --> 00:28:49,240
became the sole focus
of the prosecution's cross.

540
00:28:59,835 --> 00:29:02,453
Hello?

541
00:29:05,674 --> 00:29:08,042
Anybody home?

542
00:29:20,889 --> 00:29:22,690
Vertigo. Got ya.

543
00:29:22,692 --> 00:29:24,408
Funny, eh?

544
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:27,478
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

545
00:29:34,237 --> 00:29:36,240
Thea?

546
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:37,707
Can we call it a night?

547
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:40,627
Jury just signaled
that they could have a verdict.

548
00:29:40,629 --> 00:29:43,580
Judge will not send them home.
He wants to get this over with.

549
00:29:43,582 --> 00:29:45,197
Line forms behind me.

550
00:29:45,199 --> 00:29:47,500
A verdict that
quickly is bad, isn't it?

551
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:52,079
I think the two of you
should prepare for the worst.

552
00:29:57,653 --> 00:30:00,037
Excuse me.

553
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:00,978
Felicity...

554
00:30:00,979 --> 00:30:02,895
Oliver.

555
00:30:03,893 --> 00:30:07,562
Is it ok
if I call you Oliver?

556
00:30:07,564 --> 00:30:10,598
Surprised to hear
from me, right?

557
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,050
Not as surprised
as I was.

558
00:30:13,052 --> 00:30:15,719
You see, I find this

559
00:30:15,721 --> 00:30:19,023
not unattractive blonde,
getting all up in my business.

560
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:21,692
And what does she
have on her?

561
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:24,912
A Queen Consolidated
I.D. badge.

562
00:30:24,914 --> 00:30:29,166
Now, I think to myself,
why does that name ring a bell?

563
00:30:29,168 --> 00:30:31,669
Oliver Queen.

564
00:30:31,671 --> 00:30:34,005
He tried
to buy off me last year,

565
00:30:34,007 --> 00:30:37,291
just before the hood
put me in a padded cell.

566
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:41,128
Ipso facto, Arrow.

567
00:30:42,347 --> 00:30:44,298
Where are you going?!

568
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,384
Oh...

569
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,752
Something's come up
at the office.

570
00:30:48,754 --> 00:30:50,972
Ollie, the jury!

571
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:53,557
I have to go.

572
00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:25,139
Pretty swanky offices.

573
00:31:25,141 --> 00:31:29,010
You can see all the destruction
that your mom caused

574
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:30,928
from up here.

575
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,314
What do you want?

576
00:31:33,316 --> 00:31:35,816
World peace
and personal satisfaction.

577
00:31:35,818 --> 00:31:40,404
Though not necessarily
in that order.

578
00:31:40,406 --> 00:31:44,442
You poisoned me
and put me in a hole.

579
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:48,329
You have no idea
how much I hated you for that.

580
00:31:48,331 --> 00:31:51,165
Turns out, someone else
hates you, too.

581
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:52,867
Who?
Who?

582
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:55,436
Oh, you're going to be
surprised when you find out.

583
00:31:55,438 --> 00:31:57,838
He's a man of means.

584
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,125
Set me up with my new operation
so I could draw you out.

585
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:03,094
To do what?
This.

586
00:32:06,765 --> 00:32:09,717
You're going to have
to try harder.

587
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:12,103
Done!

588
00:32:18,527 --> 00:32:21,896
Come on!
Ahh!

589
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:29,620
So now we move on
to plan B.

590
00:32:29,622 --> 00:32:32,490
Oliver, don't!
Not for me!

591
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,825
Quiet, please.
I'm threatening.

592
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:37,995
Lower your bow.

593
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:49,640
Your problem is with me.

594
00:32:49,642 --> 00:32:51,242
It's not with her.

595
00:32:51,244 --> 00:32:53,310
Well, then, consider
this your penalty

596
00:32:53,312 --> 00:32:55,980
for making me
go to plan B in the first place.

597
00:33:09,694 --> 00:33:12,613
Hey. Hey.

598
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:14,448
Hey, shh, shh.

599
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,867
It's all right.

600
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:18,169
You're safe.

601
00:33:18,171 --> 00:33:20,504
Oh, you were shot.

602
00:33:20,506 --> 00:33:22,239
Hey.

603
00:33:22,241 --> 00:33:24,708
It's nothing.

604
00:33:56,134 --> 00:33:56,978
Any news?

605
00:33:56,979 --> 00:33:58,321
Where have you been?

606
00:34:00,409 --> 00:34:01,802
Something...

607
00:34:01,803 --> 00:34:03,602
happened at Queen Consolidated.

608
00:34:03,604 --> 00:34:06,439
You will see it
on the news later.

609
00:34:06,441 --> 00:34:08,190
Just don't worry about it.

610
00:34:08,192 --> 00:34:10,976
What would you have done
if there'd been a verdict?

611
00:34:10,978 --> 00:34:12,728
Thea...

612
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:15,398
I don't know.

613
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,149
Are you ok?

614
00:34:17,151 --> 00:34:19,518
Hey.

615
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,153
Jury's back.

616
00:34:21,155 --> 00:34:23,122
Come on.

617
00:34:23,124 --> 00:34:28,461
I have received a note that
the jury has arrived at a verdict.

618
00:34:30,247 --> 00:34:33,365
Please publish
the verdict.

619
00:34:35,001 --> 00:34:37,636
In the superior court
of Star county

620
00:34:37,638 --> 00:34:41,056
state versus
Moira Queen verdict...

621
00:34:41,058 --> 00:34:43,726
On one count of conspiracy
in the first degree,

622
00:34:43,728 --> 00:34:48,230
the defendant is found
not guilty.

623
00:34:48,232 --> 00:34:51,383
On the 503 counts
of murder in the first degree,

624
00:34:51,385 --> 00:34:54,737
the defendant is found...

625
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:58,223
Not guilty.

626
00:35:07,284 --> 00:35:09,234
Mom.

627
00:35:19,045 --> 00:35:22,080
I love you both so much.

628
00:35:31,274 --> 00:35:36,812
A stunning result, as Moira Queen is
acquitted of all charges.

629
00:35:36,814 --> 00:35:41,116
In a day that's provided a week's
worth of shocks and legal twists,

630
00:35:41,118 --> 00:35:43,369
many had pronounced
this case a done deal.

631
00:35:43,371 --> 00:35:45,871
Congratulations.

632
00:35:45,873 --> 00:35:48,491
Is that appropriate?
She should have lost.

633
00:35:48,493 --> 00:35:50,743
She should have been
convicted.

634
00:35:50,745 --> 00:35:53,996
Did you want her to be?

635
00:35:53,998 --> 00:35:56,332
I expected her to be.

636
00:35:56,334 --> 00:35:58,384
Verdict doesn't make sense.

637
00:35:58,386 --> 00:36:00,252
Still, your mom
must be thrilled. Beyond.

638
00:36:00,254 --> 00:36:03,055
It's more like
shock, I think.

639
00:36:03,057 --> 00:36:07,760
They're processing her now.
I just wanted to check in on you.

640
00:36:07,762 --> 00:36:09,562
And you.

641
00:36:09,564 --> 00:36:10,980
I'm feeling better.

642
00:36:10,982 --> 00:36:13,682
And, with the Vertigo
tainted vaccine,

643
00:36:13,684 --> 00:36:15,734
Queen Consolidated's
Applied Sciences Division

644
00:36:15,736 --> 00:36:18,254
was able to formulate
a non-addictive treatment.

645
00:36:20,607 --> 00:36:22,858
Good.

646
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:26,195
I need to meet
my family at home.

647
00:36:26,197 --> 00:36:29,582
So you guys go home,
get rest.

648
00:36:32,485 --> 00:36:34,870
Good night.

649
00:36:34,872 --> 00:36:37,623
Good night.

650
00:36:37,625 --> 00:36:40,926
Oliver. I, uh...

651
00:36:42,596 --> 00:36:44,063
I just wanted to say thank you.
Yeah.

652
00:36:44,065 --> 00:36:46,966
And I'm sorry.

653
00:36:46,968 --> 00:36:49,518
For what?

654
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,238
I got myself
into trouble again,

655
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,206
and you...
killed him.

656
00:36:54,208 --> 00:36:58,110
You killed again,
and I am sorry that I was the one

657
00:36:58,112 --> 00:37:00,613
to put you in a position where you
had to make that kind of choice.

658
00:37:00,615 --> 00:37:02,865
Felicity...

659
00:37:02,867 --> 00:37:06,619
He had you, and he was
going to hurt you.

660
00:37:08,488 --> 00:37:11,974
There was no choice to make.

661
00:37:19,666 --> 00:37:21,634
Why did you do that?!

662
00:37:21,636 --> 00:37:24,136
Because you stopped
the captain from killing me.

663
00:37:24,138 --> 00:37:26,138
Thank you for coming.

664
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,173
Shado, he doesn't
look too good.

665
00:37:28,175 --> 00:37:30,643
He's not.
Who's this?

666
00:37:30,645 --> 00:37:32,845
It's complicated.
That Hosen thing

667
00:37:32,847 --> 00:37:35,547
they're looking for
is back on the plane.

668
00:37:35,549 --> 00:37:38,684
No, I've got it.

669
00:37:38,686 --> 00:37:40,769
It has a Buddhist
inscription on one side.

670
00:37:40,771 --> 00:37:42,521
It reminded me
of my father.

671
00:37:42,523 --> 00:37:45,357
I'm pretty sure they aren't
interested in Buddhism.

672
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,493
What's on
the other side?

673
00:37:47,495 --> 00:37:51,563
30-30-175-12.

674
00:37:51,565 --> 00:37:53,231
Ok, numbers, what...

675
00:37:53,233 --> 00:37:55,534
Coordinates.

676
00:37:55,536 --> 00:37:57,920
To what?

677
00:37:57,922 --> 00:37:59,413
A Kairyu-class Japanese
submarine

678
00:37:59,438 --> 00:38:01,438
which ran aground
here during World War II.

679
00:38:02,176 --> 00:38:05,044
What do these guys want
with a 70 year old sub?

680
00:38:05,046 --> 00:38:07,379
The sub isn't important,
but what's on it...

681
00:38:07,381 --> 00:38:11,083
It'll save the human race.

682
00:38:11,085 --> 00:38:13,886
Will it save him?

683
00:38:22,646 --> 00:38:26,815
Well, you survived
your own stupidity, congratulations.

684
00:38:26,817 --> 00:38:29,535
You know...

685
00:38:29,537 --> 00:38:31,236
I needed you

686
00:38:31,238 --> 00:38:33,205
to deal with any
resistance

687
00:38:33,207 --> 00:38:35,290
that I encountered on the island.
I got to say,

688
00:38:35,292 --> 00:38:37,743
you've done a fairly
lousy job of that.

689
00:38:40,613 --> 00:38:42,280
Congratulations.

690
00:38:42,282 --> 00:38:46,218
You're the new captain.

691
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:53,225
I arranged for
to take out the Arrow,

692
00:38:53,227 --> 00:38:55,094
and all I accomplish
is reigniting

693
00:38:55,096 --> 00:38:57,396
the vigilante's
killing spree.

694
00:38:57,398 --> 00:38:58,964
Sir, there's been
a development.

695
00:39:20,787 --> 00:39:24,089
Brother Cyrus...

696
00:39:24,091 --> 00:39:27,259
How do you feel?

697
00:39:29,596 --> 00:39:31,964
Stronger.

698
00:39:31,966 --> 00:39:33,882
Good.

699
00:39:33,884 --> 00:39:37,836
Then you're ready.

700
00:39:40,841 --> 00:39:42,975
Mrs. Queen, how does
it feel to get away with murder?

701
00:39:42,977 --> 00:39:45,611
Once you go out back,
there's a car waiting for you.

702
00:39:45,613 --> 00:39:47,780
Did you kill
your first husband?

703
00:39:47,782 --> 00:39:49,314
Just keep going.

704
00:39:49,316 --> 00:39:52,184
Obviously Mrs. Queen
is overjoyed that the jury

705
00:39:52,186 --> 00:39:55,204
has ruled that she was acting
under terrible duress.

706
00:39:55,206 --> 00:39:56,622
Can you
give us anything else?

707
00:39:56,624 --> 00:39:59,458
This way,
Mrs. Queen.

708
00:40:17,977 --> 00:40:20,979
The freeway
will be quicker.

709
00:40:20,981 --> 00:40:22,514
I'm sorry,
Mrs. Queen.

710
00:40:22,516 --> 00:40:24,266
I was instructed
not to take you home.

711
00:40:24,268 --> 00:40:25,818
Not yet.

712
00:40:36,663 --> 00:40:38,947
Where are we?

713
00:40:38,949 --> 00:40:40,833
I-I don't know
this place.

714
00:40:40,835 --> 00:40:43,368
I've got her, sir.

715
00:40:48,458 --> 00:40:50,709
Hello, Moira.

716
00:40:54,014 --> 00:40:55,964
They said you were dead!

717
00:40:55,966 --> 00:40:57,749
There are parts of the world
where death is an illusion.

718
00:40:57,751 --> 00:40:59,134
I've been to one.

719
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,853
I learned to be
very convincing.

720
00:41:02,522 --> 00:41:05,724
But I returned because you
needed my help.

721
00:41:07,528 --> 00:41:09,427
Help?

722
00:41:09,429 --> 00:41:11,363
With your trial.

723
00:41:11,365 --> 00:41:13,232
You didn't think that
jury acquitted you

724
00:41:13,234 --> 00:41:14,566
without a little
persuasion?

725
00:41:14,568 --> 00:41:17,269
Dear God.

726
00:41:18,705 --> 00:41:21,824
What do you want, Malcolm?

727
00:41:21,826 --> 00:41:26,211
I still have
resources in Starling.

728
00:41:26,213 --> 00:41:27,963
Associates.

729
00:41:27,965 --> 00:41:30,165
Including one

730
00:41:30,167 --> 00:41:32,617
in the D.A.'s office.

731
00:41:32,619 --> 00:41:36,171
I followed Mr. Donner's
investigation of you with interest.

732
00:41:36,173 --> 00:41:38,340
The ease with which you lied
about us for years,

733
00:41:38,342 --> 00:41:41,009
it made me wonder
whether you lied to me

734
00:41:41,011 --> 00:41:42,895
No. No.

735
00:41:42,897 --> 00:41:46,815
It was a matter of a simple
surreptitious genetics test

736
00:41:46,817 --> 00:41:49,651
to confirm my suspicion.
Don't.

737
00:41:49,653 --> 00:41:52,354
Imagine my joy
at learning that

738
00:41:52,356 --> 00:41:55,774
Thea is my daughter.
