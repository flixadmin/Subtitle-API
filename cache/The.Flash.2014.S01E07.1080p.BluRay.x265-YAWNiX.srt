1
00:00:02,461 --> 00:00:06,465
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:10,761
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:13,347
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,517
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,771
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:24,775
but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:30,155
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:32,157
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,701
Previously on The Flash:

10
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:35,953
Ronnie.

11
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:38,872
Seventeen people died that night.
Many more were injured.

12
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:41,250
I'm not the most popular person these days.

13
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:45,212
We're just supposed to get used
to working above a makeshift prison...

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,965
housing evil people with superpowers.

15
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:51,718
- What is this?
- Somewhere you'll never hurt anyone again.

16
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:01,311
- Farooq!
- It's not safe. Come down.

17
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:04,273
Farooq, I'm serious. It's gonna rain.

18
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:08,485
Y'all are tripping.
This is the best seat in the house. Whoo!

19
00:01:08,652 --> 00:01:12,281
You know, when I said we should watch
the particle accelerator turn on...

20
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:15,867
I just meant we should get naked
and howl at the moon.

21
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:20,038
It's already on. Consider me unimpressed.

22
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,459
Whoo! Yeah, baby!

23
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:30,716
- Oh, my God. This is awesome.
- Are you seeing this?

24
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,802
- Oh, man. I think I am tripping.
- Ha, ha, ha.

25
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,805
Oh, man.

26
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,444
Get in the car! Get in the car!

27
00:01:58,910 --> 00:01:59,995
Farooq!

28
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:03,415
- Oh, my God, Farooq!
- Farooq!

29
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:04,708
Argh!

30
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,620
- Good day, Dr. Wells.
- One can always hope, Gideon.

31
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,872
- Bring up my log, would you?
- Certainly.

32
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,334
- Go ahead, doctor.
- New entry.

33
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:51,046
It has now been 311 days
since lightning struck.

34
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:55,592
Subject has begun relying
on his speed in everyday life.

35
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:58,095
Using his extraordinary powers...

36
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,305
lo solve ordinary problems.

37
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,433
I'm late.

38
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:07,437
Accomplish ordinary tasks.

39
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:12,192
Unfortunately, his penchant
for the heroic persists.

40
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:16,405
I hate it when they let the new guy
train during the morning rush.

41
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,128
- The fact is...
- Don't try nothing.

42
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,881
- He can be a bit of a show-off.
- Wallet. Now.

43
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:37,259
Oh, this is awesome.
You've gotta be kidding me.

44
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:39,261
Hold on, okay? I'm gonna set this down.

45
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:44,433
Heh, heh. This is crazy. There are hundreds
of thousands of people in Central City.

46
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,519
Out of everyone you could
have picked to rob, you pick me. Heh, heh.

47
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:50,313
What are you, sick? Money. Now.

48
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,607
You're really gonna
be kicking yourself, man.

49
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:56,236
I mean, if there was an Olympics
for bad luck, you didn't just medal, pal.

50
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:57,529
You Michael Phelps-ed.

51
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:00,574
I'm gonna count to three,
then I'm gonna shoot you.

52
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,159
- One...
- Yeah.

53
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:03,785
Two...

54
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:12,085
And while his desire
to help others is commendable...

55
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:17,132
it is impeding him from realizing
the full scope of his abilities.

56
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,134
But...

57
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,928
there's still time.

58
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,931
As the future remains intact.

59
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:34,399
- Where's Barry? He's late.
- Late is kind of his signature move.

60
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:38,236
Hey, you guys wanna see
my signature move?

61
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,699
Sorry, guys. I got a little held up.

62
00:04:45,202 --> 00:04:46,620
You had to be there.

63
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:49,206
I'm gonna need a moment
or two alone with Barry.

64
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:56,421
Ooh, you're in trouble.

65
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,174
Now, may I remind you, Mr. Allen...

66
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:02,219
we had an agreement that we would help
with your heroics...

67
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:06,014
while you would help us research
and develop your abilities in here. Right?

68
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,183
Yeah. No, I know.

69
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:11,853
I guess I've just gotten a little caught up
with being able to help people.

70
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,480
Put bad guys away. Feels good.

71
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:17,859
Imagine how good it would feel to cure
diseases, stop aging, reverse paralysis.

72
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,569
All good causes.

73
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:24,199
So how can I help you do that?
You need more MRIs? More blood?

74
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:25,450
I need more speed.

75
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,454
- Okay.
- Speed is the key to progress.

76
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:32,457
You need to kick it up a notch.

77
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:38,421
There was a homicide.
I'm sorry. I've gotta go.

78
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,465
This is not just about you.

79
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:41,800
Remember that, Barry.

80
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,845
Yeah.

81
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,818
- I hope you both skipped your breakfast.
- Whoa.

82
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,987
What the hell could do that?

83
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,198
Two thousand four hundred degrees,
give or take.

84
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:09,661
This area is filled with combustibles.
How come nothing else burned up?

85
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:11,997
Where you going?

86
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,624
See the soot on the ground
where the cement is burnt?

87
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:18,169
- Yeah.
- That's evidence of arc blasts.

88
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,548
Happens when high amperage currents
travel or arc through the air.

89
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:25,969
There's no live wires.
There's no utility poles.

90
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:28,138
So how was this guy electrocuted?

91
00:06:30,724 --> 00:06:32,726
The first thing we need to do is ID him.

92
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:34,394
Yeah.

93
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:38,440
His face is melted off.
How's that picture gonna help ID him?

94
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:42,193
- I've got mad skills.
- Please don't ever say that again.

95
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:44,571
All right.

96
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,576
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. Why?

97
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,536
I don't know. You seem a little off.

98
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,374
No, I'm fine.

99
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,251
All right.

100
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,840
Facial reconstructive software.

101
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:07,928
It was designed for archeologists, and
it should help us ID your crispy corpse.

102
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,180
How did he get fried in the first place?

103
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:13,183
Is there a metahuman
that can control electricity?

104
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:16,603
It'd take a serious electrostatic discharge
to cause that tissue damage.

105
00:07:16,895 --> 00:07:18,521
Guys, according to the software...

106
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,691
there's an 82 percent chance
your victim looked like this.

107
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:26,488
- Eighty-two?
- It was zero when you walked in here, pal.

108
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,990
Cross reference with the DMV database?
Get a name?

109
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,826
Absolutely.
This software can do just about anything.

110
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:33,912
Now that Felicity reprogrammed it.

111
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:39,709
Casey Donahue. No wife, no kids. Used to
work at the Petersburg electrical substation.

112
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,503
That can't be a coincidence.

113
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:45,048
That's weird. Someone just used his ID
to enter the substation.

114
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:48,593
The Petersburg grid is experiencing
a power drain right now.

115
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,428
Barry be...

116
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:51,930
careful.

117
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,574
I'm pretty sure this is a restricted area.

118
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,919
Easy there, zappy.

119
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,631
I have to feed.

120
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,643
Whoa, what was that?

121
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,570
More of that.

122
00:08:49,154 --> 00:08:50,488
I need more.

123
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,906
Barry, what's happening?

124
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,300
Too much.

125
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,094
Too much.

126
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,221
Get out of there.

127
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:21,269
Run, Barry.

128
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:25,982
I can't.

129
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:28,109
My speed...

130
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,445
Is gone.

131
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:44,084
- He runs slow even for a normal person.
- Unh.

132
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,586
You can't just lose your powers. Okay?

133
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,506
Your DNA was transformed
by the particle accelerator blast.

134
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,758
There's no way to untransform DNA.

135
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:55,762
Yeah? Tell that to the Uber driver
who charged me 65 bucks to take me here.

136
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,014
Had to say I was coming
from a cosplay party.

137
00:09:58,181 --> 00:10:02,644
So we were wrong. This metahuman doesn't
electrocute people. He siphons electricity...

138
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,354
thereby removing your power.

139
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:08,942
All right, do we think
this is temporary or...?

140
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,277
We have to run tests.

141
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,696
Yeah.

142
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,615
I've gotta warn Joe.

143
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:21,538
Barry, we will find a way
to restore your speed.

144
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,498
I promise you that.

145
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,142
- You didn't catch it.
- I loved that mug.

146
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:45,145
What part of "a metahuman stole
my speed" didn't you understand?

147
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:49,399
Barry, there's no part of anything
you can do that I ever understand.

148
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,485
- What does Dr. Wells say?
- He's working on it.

149
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:55,029
Barry, you have to get your speed back.

150
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,532
The people in this city need protecting.

151
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,952
If you don't get your speed,
how the hell are we gonna keep them safe?

152
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:04,914
The meta who stole my speed, he burned
up the body we saw in the alley today.

153
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,750
Tell the police not to confront him.
He's dangerous.

154
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,545
- Who's dangerous?
- No one.

155
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:14,757
- Just some thief.
- Well, criminals better watch out.

156
00:11:14,966 --> 00:11:17,552
Cops in Central City
are the best there are.

157
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,264
And if you can't protect this city, Dad,
I know the Flash will.

158
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:24,934
What if he can't? What if he's gone?

159
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:26,477
Gone?

160
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,271
Or maybe he's just done.

161
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,983
Or maybe whatever he could do before,
he can't do anymore.

162
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,777
Don't you have some place to be?

163
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,071
Yeah. I'm going.

164
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,535
Aw. Barry loved that mug.

165
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,804
That's a quality timepiece, young man.

166
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,390
Oh. Um, thanks.

167
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:06,809
They took mine.

168
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:08,102
All of them.

169
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:12,148
Guess you shouldn't have done
whatever it is you did.

170
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,494
- Gideon, show me the future.
- Certainly, doctor.

171
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:32,919
Run a complete search.
Show any references to the Flash.

172
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:35,672
- Zero references to the Flash.
- Look again.

173
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,173
Zero references.

174
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,551
- Show any references to Barry Allen.
- Zero references to Barry Allen.

175
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:45,431
- Look again.
- I've searched 3452 times, Dr. Wells.

176
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:46,849
There's nothing.

177
00:12:54,357 --> 00:12:57,318
- You think I'll ever wear it again?
- I hope so.

178
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:03,616
I didn't have my speed for very long.

179
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:08,997
But now that it's gone,
it feels like part of me is gone too.

180
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:12,083
With or without your speed,
you're still you, Barry.

181
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,794
But I'm not.

182
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,547
I'm not the best version of me.

183
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,842
I love being the Flash.

184
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,887
I love everything about it.

185
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:28,308
The feeling of running
hundreds of miles per hour.

186
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:32,520
Wind and power just rushing past my face.

187
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:34,522
Being able to help people.

188
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:39,986
I'm not sure I can
live without it, Caitlin.

189
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:43,072
Farooq Gibran.

190
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,701
- Who?
- The powers vampire who jacked your speed.

191
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:51,164
I hacked into surveillance footage from the
substation. It was easy to find a match.

192
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:54,542
He climbed an electrical tower
the night of the accelerator explosion.

193
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,753
No surprise where his powers came from.

194
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:06,012
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
This is not happening.

195
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,931
Dr. Harrison Wells, I need to see you!

196
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,101
Come on. I know you're inside.
Open the door.

197
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,104
I just wanna talk, Dr. Wells.

198
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:18,858
Wells, let me in!

199
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,112
Joe.

200
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:24,947
Hello, Iris.

201
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:28,951
I am out. I need you to cover for me
until the shift change.

202
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,955
Only one headline. Prison transfer.
William Tockman.

203
00:14:32,979 --> 00:14:34,979
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

204
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,009
Guns on the floor.

205
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:29,804
It should take you
less than three seconds...

206
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:32,682
to discard any thought
of rebellion and comply.

207
00:15:35,685 --> 00:15:38,020
I take it I don't need to count out loud.

208
00:15:42,859 --> 00:15:44,861
Hm. Hm.

209
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,612
Striking resemblance.

210
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,548
He's inside.

211
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:17,268
Captain, Tockman has at least 10 hostages.

212
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:19,520
Two officers down.

213
00:16:20,855 --> 00:16:24,233
- Copy that. When is the power back?
- We're on gennies for now.

214
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:27,904
- Not now.
- Wait.

215
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:32,200
Capt. Singh, I've been trying to get in
touch with Joe or anyone at the precinct.

216
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,328
There's a hostage situation, Barry.

217
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:38,873
Joe's inside, so is his daughter.

218
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:42,084
- I'll call you when I know more.
- Wait.

219
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:48,424
Joe and Iris are in trouble.
I need my powers back now.

220
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:51,469
I have a theory. It's untested.

221
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:54,847
- I'm willing to roll the dice.
- Okay. You've lost your speed. Yes.

222
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:58,267
But nothing has changed
inside you on a subatomic level.

223
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:02,063
- Your cells are still primed.
- They just need a jump-start.

224
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,689
Okay, how do we jump-start me?

225
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,900
Replicate the initial jolt to your system.

226
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:10,238
But that would mean a peak current
of at least 20,000 kiloamps.

227
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:13,741
That's more electricity than they
give to people in the electric chair.

228
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:17,286
Caitlin, with Farooq in the building,
we're looking at a death sentence.

229
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:19,080
The spare generator's offline.

230
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:21,290
If we reboot it,
we could get a charge that big.

231
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,543
We need something
that can transmit the load...

232
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:26,045
from the generator to Barry
without shorting out.

233
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:28,548
The treadmill.
My baby could take the charge.

234
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:32,510
- What if Barry can't?
- Well, that's up to Mr. Allen.

235
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,762
Where are you going?

236
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,099
I'm gonna talk to him.

237
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,476
- Nope. Nope.
- Okay...

238
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:44,105
you didn't see him at the substation.
He needed to feed.

239
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:47,066
I got super speed
out of the particle accelerator blast.

240
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:49,777
But his best friends died.
He woke up with a disease.

241
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:51,862
Earlier today, you worked a crime scene...

242
00:17:52,029 --> 00:17:54,365
where this metahuman
electrocuted an innocent man.

243
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:55,741
He's a murderer.

244
00:17:55,950 --> 00:18:00,079
And you are powerless
to defend yourself against him.

245
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:04,208
He may just need help like I did.
I don't need my powers to offer him that.

246
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,626
I have to try.

247
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,340
Tockman.

248
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,092
Tockman.

249
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,094
Tockman.

250
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:19,098
I am presently in control
of eight of Central City's finest...

251
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:22,935
three underpaid assistants,
and one very brave civilian girl.

252
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:24,937
You've got demands. I wanna hear them.

253
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,481
But first, let the civilians go.

254
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:31,068
Would you prefer
I sent them out alive or dead?

255
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,737
Please be more specific.

256
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,365
One helicopter.
One vegetarian takeout meal.

257
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:40,620
One laptop with eight gigabytes of RAM
will be delivered on this roof...

258
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:45,708
at exactly 53 minutes
and 27 seconds from now...

259
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,419
or I shoot a hostage.

260
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:52,298
There is a citywide blackout.
I'm gonna need more time.

261
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:56,385
Captain, you may delay, but time will not.

262
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,429
Benjamin Franklin.

263
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,807
Very good, detective.

264
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:09,065
Hey, whoa. Whoa, easy.

265
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,608
I'm not gonna hurt you.

266
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,486
You can't hurt me.

267
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,113
Where is Harrison Wells?

268
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,282
Look, I know what happened to you.

269
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:21,160
The night of the accelerator explosion,
it changed you.

270
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:23,829
It changed me too.

271
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:29,418
You were the one in the red suit.

272
00:19:30,461 --> 00:19:32,338
I fed from you.

273
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:36,509
- I have to keep feeding.
- Right. I know this has to be terrifying.

274
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,886
That's why I wanna help you.

275
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:40,137
Okay?

276
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:45,267
The night of the explosion
when the light hit me, it stopped my heart.

277
00:19:46,102 --> 00:19:48,896
- Jake and Darya.
- They were your friends.

278
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,565
I woke up and they were beside me, dead.

279
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:55,695
They tried to give me CPR.
They were touching me and...

280
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,905
I electrocuted them.

281
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:02,243
This is not your fault.

282
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,622
I know.

283
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,711
Wells did this to me.

284
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,257
Farooq, you need to listen to me.

285
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:30,813
- Not sure how long that'll hold.
- Done being noble, Mr. Allen?

286
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,858
Caitlin, get him to the treadmill.

287
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:38,404
Cisco, bring the generator online.
Make sure Barry gets the charge.

288
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,614
What? You're not coming with me?

289
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:42,992
I am not leaving you.

290
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,994
Listen to me.

291
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,037
Of everything I've done in my life...

292
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:51,542
of everything I have invented,
my most important creation is the Flash.

293
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:55,212
Barry Allen must have a future. Now, go.

294
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,590
Go.

295
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:06,474
End this now, and I'll talk to the DA.

296
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:12,062
It was your district attorney
that denied me furlough...

297
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,691
So I could visit my dying sister
one last time.

298
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:20,070
Say goodbye to her in person.

299
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,656
Time I'll never get back!

300
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,788
So however long I have in this life...

301
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,457
I promise not one second more...

302
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:35,336
will be spent in a prison cell.

303
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,505
- Unh!
- Got him.

304
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,048
Eddie!

305
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:46,263
Eddie. Eddie.

306
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,974
An officer was just shot 9.2 seconds ago.

307
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:53,562
I'd pick up the pace
in meeting my demands, captain.

308
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,445
I'm not healing fast anymore.

309
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,076
- That's unfortunate.
- Don't worry.

310
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,578
When Dr. Wells has a theory,
he's usually right.

311
00:22:10,246 --> 00:22:13,374
What if something happens
to Joe and Iris first?

312
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:45,739
Come to check on your pet?

313
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:49,326
Why don't you just kill me, huh?
Get it over with.

314
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,247
Quid pro quo.

315
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,750
That's Latin, Mr. Woodward.
You've heard of Latin?

316
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,211
Quid pro quo means
"something for something."

317
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,798
And in this case
that something is your freedom.

318
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,885
I'm prepared to grant it to you.

319
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:08,846
How do you know I won't kill you?

320
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:11,223
A calculated risk. One I'm willing to take.

321
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,392
- Really?
- That's right.

322
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:15,561
- Why would you do that?
- Because...

323
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,856
there is another metahuman
loose in this facility.

324
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:24,612
And I want you to kill him.

325
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,348
Did you know the human body
generates electricity?

326
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:56,185
The average person gives off 342 watts.

327
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:58,896
And I can smell it coming from you.

328
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,339
Turn on the treadmill.

329
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:28,217
- You're still hurt.
- We don't have time.

330
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,270
Been dying to punch somebody.

331
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,034
Ouch.

332
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:55,661
- Caitlin.
- I can't.

333
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:58,998
- We don't have a choice.
- If I turn this on, it could Kill you.

334
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,666
If you don't, we could all die.

335
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:04,294
I already lost someone I cared about
in this building. I can't do it again.

336
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,507
Listen.

337
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:12,094
Someone once told me that I was
struck by that lightning for a reason.

338
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:14,346
That it chose me.

339
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:15,848
I'm not sure I believe it.

340
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,560
Right now, it doesn't
matter what I believe.

341
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,399
What do you believe?

342
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,367
Come on.

343
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,044
Unh!

344
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,214
My God. You okay?

345
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:50,632
Did you feel anything?

346
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,475
It didn't work.

347
00:26:05,439 --> 00:26:08,525
Please. He's bleeding.
You have to let us get him some help.

348
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:09,985
You'll stay where you are.

349
00:26:10,444 --> 00:26:12,654
While you're killing time,
he's bleeding out.

350
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:17,159
"As if you could kill time
without wounding eternity."

351
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,702
Henry David Thoreau.

352
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,371
Good.

353
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:31,340
- Little battlefield trick.
- Eddie.

354
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:40,182
If he lives long enough
to receive medical treatment...

355
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:43,894
they'll know the exact time
the tourniquet was applied.

356
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:47,189
What? No "thank you"? Heh, heh.

357
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,025
They call you the Clock King, right?

358
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:55,405
A somewhat florid appellation,
but I've grown to see the humor in it.

359
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:59,201
- You're going back to prison.
- Really? Heh, heh.

360
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:02,412
- And how do you reckon?
- Because the Flash is coming.

361
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,206
Oh.

362
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,710
Where are you?

363
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:21,265
Tony. Tony, what are you doing?

364
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,183
Come on. You know me, Allen.

365
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:25,727
I never run from a fight.

366
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:29,523
All right. Well, stay with me. Okay?
You're good.

367
00:27:32,234 --> 00:27:34,153
Run. Unh.

368
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,529
What?

369
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,364
Hey.

370
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,158
Tony.

371
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:44,288
No.

372
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,499
Barry.

373
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:56,925
Early.

374
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:04,808
You ever see the city at night by
helicopter? It's quite spectacular.

375
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,734
You're winded. That's not good.

376
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,445
I need to take your blood
and figure out what happened.

377
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:19,156
I can't believe he's dead.

378
00:28:19,323 --> 00:28:20,407
Dr. Wells?

379
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,702
No. No. Tony Woodward.

380
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:27,039
- He escaped the Pipeline.
- He must've got out when the blackout hit.

381
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:30,500
Not possible. The Pipeline was designed
to withstand power outage.

382
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,753
Someone had to have let him go.

383
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,087
I did.

384
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:36,840
I released him.

385
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,051
Why?

386
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:42,429
To divert our intruder's attention
while we worked to restore your speed.

387
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,514
You used him as a distraction?

388
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,935
An unnecessary one as it turns out,
it seems the plan has failed.

389
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:57,945
I have his blood on me.
How could you do that?

390
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:01,240
You're showing sentiment
for a man who tormented you as a child.

391
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:05,160
Tony might've been a bully then and now,
but he didn't deserve to die.

392
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:08,914
Does Caitlin, or Cisco, or me, or you?

393
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:13,043
I had a choice to make, him or us.
I chose us without a second thought.

394
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:16,755
Well, all your talk about miracle cures
and scientific breakthroughs...

395
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:19,508
but you don't care about people at all.

396
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:22,386
Maybe you care too much.
Being a hero is important to you.

397
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,639
I respect your ideals.
I don't have the luxury of sharing them.

398
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:29,226
I forgot. Your game's chess.

399
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:32,896
We're all just pawns to you. Right?

400
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:36,441
So, what's your move, doctor?

401
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,902
Which one of us gets sacrificed next?

402
00:29:54,293 --> 00:29:55,544
We have to get out.

403
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:57,212
We just left him on D-level.

404
00:29:57,379 --> 00:29:59,840
We'll never make the main entrance
from here.

405
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,134
What about the garage?
The mobile lab van?

406
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:03,844
It's my move, Mr. Allen.

407
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,138
And I say we make a run for it.

408
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:07,639
Oh, my God. Barry, look.

409
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:10,267
Your cells are rapidly regenerating.

410
00:30:16,023 --> 00:30:18,650
- I still don't have my speed.
- It must be mental.

411
00:30:19,693 --> 00:30:21,653
Not physical.

412
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:25,699
- Ho-ho. You have the yips.
- The what's?

413
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,827
When a second baseman
all of a sudden can't throw to first...

414
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:32,372
or a golfer tries to putt,
and they get all embarrassed and upset.

415
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:36,543
That makes the yips worse, and it's a hot
mess. They feel like even more of a failure.

416
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:39,421
That's not helping.

417
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:46,553
You asked if I believed you were struck by
lightning for a reason, if you were chosen.

418
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,638
I believe.

419
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,307
You should too.

420
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:54,436
Let's move.

421
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:02,694
Tockman, no. No. Don't do this.
Not her. Take me. Please.

422
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:06,615
Something tells me you will not
be a docile passenger. She will.

423
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:10,118
- Dad. Dad.
- Wait. Wait. Let her say goodbye.

424
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:13,497
This is her boyfriend lying here dying.

425
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:18,960
I think you and me both know
that he probably won't make it.

426
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:22,089
It's wrong you didn't get to
say goodbye to your sister.

427
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:23,840
Give them what you deserved.

428
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:31,306
You have 20 seconds.

429
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,476
Eddie. Eddie.

430
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:37,604
- Sorry, babe.
- No. Please.

431
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:41,316
You have to hang on for me. Okay?
I'm gonna be right back.

432
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:46,738
Ankle holster.

433
00:31:58,708 --> 00:31:59,876
Let's go.

434
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:08,468
Second van. Keys are inside.

435
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:10,345
Come on.

436
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,891
Get in. Come on.

437
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:25,777
Come on.

438
00:32:26,111 --> 00:32:27,195
He's here.

439
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:39,541
Unh!

440
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,543
- Barry.
- Quickly.

441
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:44,713
"Time and tide wait for no man."

442
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,552
- Wait. Let her say goodbye.
- You have 20 seconds.

443
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,095
Ankle holster.

444
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,103
Iris!

445
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:03,190
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

446
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,775
- Did he hit you?
- Yeah. I'm okay.

447
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,403
- Guys.
- Oh, my God.

448
00:33:09,446 --> 00:33:11,948
- Oh, my God. No. Please.
- Hey.

449
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,328
You're here for me.

450
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,290
Finally, you show your face.

451
00:33:20,874 --> 00:33:24,211
Well, I wasn't exactly eager to be killed.

452
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,338
Neither were my friends.

453
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,507
I know.

454
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:30,300
I hurt a lot of people that night.

455
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:33,136
People? You don't even know their names.

456
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:35,597
Jake Davenport.

457
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,098
Darya Kim.

458
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:41,728
Ralph Dibney. Al Rothstein. Grant Emerson.

459
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:45,148
Will Everett. Bea De Costa.

460
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,234
Ronnie Raymond.

461
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:52,239
I know the names of every person
who died that night. They mattered.

462
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:55,700
And the fact that the world
is now deprived of their potential...

463
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:59,496
ils something I have to live
with every day, but these people...

464
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:03,041
These people have done nothing wrong.
You wanna punish me? Fine.

465
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,252
Let's do that.

466
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:08,129
But let these people live.

467
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:14,886
You died that night too.

468
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,223
No!

469
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:20,475
You just didn't know it till today.

470
00:35:25,415 --> 00:35:27,208
Iris.

471
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:14,756
- We could've called him Blackout.
- He had a name, Cisco.

472
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:17,425
I'm still not sure what happened.

473
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:21,304
Why didn't he just siphon
all my powers like before?

474
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:25,934
Because you finally stopped thinking about
your powers and just connected to them.

475
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:30,438
Look. This is a sample of your blood from
just after you were struck by lightning.

476
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:35,443
Now your cells are generating
more energy than ever before.

477
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:39,197
It was more energy
than the meta could safely handle.

478
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,324
It's almost like he choked on you.

479
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:45,161
- What does that mean?
- I think it means you kicked it up a notch.

480
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,172
Dr. Wells.

481
00:36:57,298 --> 00:37:01,302
What I said about
how you don't care about people...

482
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:05,265
Mm. No. Look, Barry.

483
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:12,147
There is a reason
that my biography describes me as...

484
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:16,276
arrogant, prickly, brusque.

485
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,986
"At times, contemptuous.”

486
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,905
- I read it twice.
- You were right.

487
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:23,825
I don't care much for people.
I find them misinformed.

488
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,118
Shortsighted.

489
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,996
So why do you do what you do?
Why get up in the morning?

490
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:29,998
Because I believe in a better future.

491
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:33,668
One that I very much want to see.
One that you are a part of.

492
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:40,091
I might not much care for people, Barry,
but I care about you.

493
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:56,149
- Hey, Allen.
- Hey, Eddie.

494
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:57,817
Flowers?

495
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:00,737
That's so nice. Heh, heh, heh.

496
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,531
Where were you all night?

497
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:07,202
Home. Tried to eat all the ice cream
before it melted.

498
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,621
I love ice cream. Ha, ha, ha.

499
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,164
He is on pain meds.

500
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:14,542
Lots of them, but he's gonna be okay.

501
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:18,087
It's been some night.
I am gonna get some coffee. I'll be back.

502
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:23,676
Do it.

503
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:32,227
Awesome.
I guess you're feeling better.

504
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:34,145
Oh, yeah.

505
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,397
Did you guys see that?

506
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:42,070
You're just high, partner.

507
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:45,824
Right. I forgot. Ha, ha, ha.

508
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,373
Oh, now you show up.

509
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:55,875
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you tonight.

510
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:57,627
It couldn't be helped.

511
00:38:57,836 --> 00:39:02,006
It's okay. A girl's gotta be her own hero
every now and again.

512
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:04,884
I promise I'll never be late again.

513
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:09,389
My best friend is always saying that,
and he is always late.

514
00:39:11,975 --> 00:39:13,977
You're worth being on time for.

515
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,946
Honey, you all right?

516
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:26,948
Yeah. Why?

517
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,200
You forgot your coffee.

518
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:32,787
Oh. Heh.

519
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,420
Good day, Dr. Wells.

520
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:43,840
Yes it is, Gideon. Bring up my log, please.
New entry.

521
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:47,844
It has now been 312 days
since lightning struck.

522
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:52,223
In the past 24 hours,
subject has taken a great leap forward...

523
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:56,352
causing me to revise my initial thesis.

524
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:58,146
I thought...

525
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:01,107
Well, I thought
his attachment to people...

526
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:03,276
was a distraction
slowing down his progress.

527
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:07,238
Now I realize the opposite is true.

528
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,532
Barry's attachment to people...

529
00:40:09,741 --> 00:40:12,160
people he cares about...

530
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:16,247
Is actually the key
to getting him up to speed.

531
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:21,252
In the meantime, good news.

532
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:25,381
The future remains intact.

533
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:30,178
You're early.

534
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:33,598
Yeah. I know. It feels weird to me too.

535
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:36,893
I thought after yesterday,
you'd wanna sleep in.

536
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:40,063
Can't. There's too much work to do.

537
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:42,982
I'm ready to do it. I wanna push myself.

538
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:45,610
Find out how fast I can really go.

539
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:48,237
You were right.

540
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,740
This is not just about me.

541
00:40:51,491 --> 00:40:53,034
Let's get to work.

542
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:35,159
Now, you...

543
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:41,749
had the ability to steal
the Flash's powers, and I...

544
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:49,632
would love to know...

545
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:54,971
how you did that.

546
00:41:54,995 --> 00:42:02,995
