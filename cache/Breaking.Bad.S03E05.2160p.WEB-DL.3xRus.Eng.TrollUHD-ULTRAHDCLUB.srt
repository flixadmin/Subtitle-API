1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,800
I am awake.

2
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:14,472
You are not how I remember you
from class. I mean, like, not at all.

3
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:26,484
Dude, this isn't even 7 grand,
all right? My guy wants 85.

4
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:31,072
This is all the money I have
in the world.

5
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:34,617
You are a drug dealer. Negotiate.

6
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:37,912
Buy the RV.

7
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,416
We start tomorrow.

8
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:54,429
Work it, work it, baby.
Yo, this is sick, brother.

9
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,181
Totally. God.

10
00:00:56,348 --> 00:01:01,269
Yo, Jesse, I got these two fine ladies
who wanna participate.

11
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:04,689
- You got the funds?
- Oh, I got the funds. Hey.

12
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:07,275
Would you ladies like to meet
my fat stack?

13
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:10,779
Get in here.

14
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,823
Come on.

15
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:15,784
Hey, yo, yo.

16
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,037
Yo, you got champagne?
None of that cheap stuff.

17
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,915
I want the expensive shit.
Don PÃ©rignon.

18
00:01:22,123 --> 00:01:23,458
It's 400 a bottle.

19
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:27,128
Oh, well, in that case,
I'll only have two.

20
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:31,716
Oh, and I want the tall, skinny glasses.
I like those skinny glasses.

21
00:01:31,882 --> 00:01:36,513
That's what James Bond drinks.
Mofos, I'm all about that.

22
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:40,517
Yo, Jesse, man, I gotta ask.

23
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:44,604
- Where did you get all the cheddar?
- Must be moving mad volume.

24
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,981
It's funny.
You wanna know what's funny?

25
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:49,859
- What's funny?
- This old dude, he gave it to me.

26
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,319
- What?
- He gave it to me.

27
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:52,987
It's his entire life savings.

28
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:56,991
- What? Why?
- Because he's a dumb-ass. That's why.

29
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,451
Oh, God.

30
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,414
Yes!

31
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,208
All right, living large, players.

32
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:12,066
Thank you. Yo, thank you.

33
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:17,071
- Thank you.
- That was...

34
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,995
Awesome, bro.

35
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,499
Later.

36
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,834
Oh, man.

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,378
Oh, I'm so dead.

38
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:36,090
I only got... Oh, damn.

39
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:42,013
I only got, like, 1400.

40
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:45,683
Waffle House? Yeah.

41
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,769
No, man.

42
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:51,105
Supposed to use that dude's money
to buy an RV.

43
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:56,361
- What do you want with a RV for?
- Because, like...

44
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,613
Because, like...

45
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,282
Never mind.

46
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:02,700
Jesus.

47
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:08,540
Now I gotta, like, leave town
or change my identity or something.

48
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:11,251
Guy's blackmailing me.

49
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:15,964
He's got, like, a criminal mind, yo.

50
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,132
RV, yeah?

51
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:22,387
I can hook you up, bro.
I can totally get you an RV.

52
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:27,934
- No, I need it today. Now.
- No problem. Let's go.

53
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,563
You're telling me you can get me an RV?

54
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,815
For 1400, at 6 in the morning?

55
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,693
Right on.

56
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,743
So do I need to sign something?

57
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:24,407
No, it's, like, a no-paperwork-type deal.

58
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:31,039
Pleasure doing business with you.

59
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,375
Come on, we gotta bounce.

60
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:36,669
- What?
- For real, yo. Get it out of here.

61
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:31,349
Oh, my God, I love this floor.

62
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,853
This feels fantastic.

63
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,564
{\an8}Can you control the temperature?

64
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:42,402
{\an8}Yeah. There should be a switch
right next to you there.

65
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,862
{\an8}It's a thermostat.

66
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:54,038
{\an8}Ted, this has gotta be

67
00:06:54,204 --> 00:06:58,459
{\an8}the most amazing invention ever.

68
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:01,713
{\an8}I know. Contractor talked me into it.

69
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:05,967
{\an8}Seemed kind of extravagant, but...

70
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:09,804
{\an8}I gotta tell you, once you try it,
you can't go back.

71
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,809
{\an8}I can never find anything in this Buick.

72
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:21,941
You know, you could leave
a few things here if you want.

73
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:49,177
- Why don't you go get your dad?
- Sure.

74
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,603
Hey, Dad.

75
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:02,857
{\an8}- Dad?
- Yeah.

76
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,610
{\an8}Mom's asking.

77
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:07,820
{\an8}Wanna come to dinner?

78
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,698
{\an8}Yeah, I'll be right there.

79
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:18,956
You're not listening to me.
I don't know.

80
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:21,292
<i>Yeah, right, like you don't know.</i>

81
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,961
- What did I just say?
- Give me the phone. Give it.

82
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:27,215
{\an8}Like you didn't make some deal
behind my back.

83
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:29,175
{\an8}<i>Correct. I did not.</i>

84
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,177
I was sitting at a stoplight

85
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,388
minding my own business,
when the man... The man...

86
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:37,683
The kid threw a bag of money
through my window.

87
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,852
Whatever, man.
You owe me that money.

88
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,813
- Let me talk to him.
<i>- I owe you?</i>

89
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,898
I owe you nothing.

90
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,365
And I will get to the bottom of this.
Trust me.

91
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,486
Trust you? Trust you?
That's a good one.

92
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:50,203
Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.

93
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,241
{\an8}You wanna talk about trust, Jesse?
Let's talk about trust.

94
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:57,078
{\an8}I told you not to cook my formula,
and you went ahead and did it anyway.

95
00:08:57,245 --> 00:09:00,895
Because I never said I wouldn't cook it
because it ain't yours. It's ours.

96
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,041
Plural, bitch.

97
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,044
You did not have my permission.

98
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,880
All I know is I got half the money
I'm due,

99
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,549
and you got the rest.

100
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,342
Escalating. You're escalating.

101
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:15,179
You know what? Escalate this.
My meth, my money!

102
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:20,643
<i>I will be a one-man glass factory.
I will rock that RV 24...</i>

103
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:27,752
It's buttoned up tight.
Can't see a damn thing.

104
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,670
I ain't feeling it.

105
00:10:30,504 --> 00:10:34,300
No smoke, no smell, no waste.
There's no cook.

106
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:38,512
Could be they're setting up.
I heard movement inside.

107
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,849
I say we call it a night,
come back with a search warrant.

108
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:44,727
I'm not letting this sucker
out of my sight.

109
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:47,313
There's gotta be a way.

110
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:51,359
There's gotta be a way.
There's gotta be a way...

111
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,324
Hey, hey, hey.

112
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,068
What are you doing?

113
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:53,546
- No, no, no.
- What the hell are you doing up there?

114
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,424
Are you some kind of a pervert?

115
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:59,552
{\an8}Yeah, because we were here last year.

116
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:03,264
{\an8}Sorry. I appreciate...

117
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:05,766
{\an8}Going after the bad guys.

118
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:10,855
{\an8}I'm sorry and enjoy the rest
of your vacation. Okay?

119
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,239
{\an8}Go back to your trailers.
Everything's okay.

120
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,287
{\an8}Guy's VFW. He's cool.

121
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:29,304
{\an8}We're gonna check out a couple more
and call it a morning.

122
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,959
{\an8}- Okay, what do you say?
- Can't. Gotta get home.

123
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:35,337
Why, you leave your balls
in your wife's purse or what?

124
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,339
Gotta pack.

125
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,550
Where you headed?

126
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,221
Texas.

127
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,493
{\an8}Hey there.

128
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,455
Hank?

129
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,502
{\an8}Hank?

130
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,473
Can I come in?

131
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,601
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

132
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:34,939
- How did it go last night?
- Good.

133
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:37,108
Catch the bad guys?

134
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,860
Nope.

135
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:44,323
- Want me to make you breakfast?
- No. I'm...

136
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:47,034
I'm heading back out after this.

137
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:50,454
Now? You worked all night.

138
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,374
Get some sleep, Hank.
Those RVs aren't going anywhere.

139
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:57,294
They're recreational vehicles, Marie.
That's what they do.

140
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,296
You know what I mean.

141
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,300
I spoke with Blanca.

142
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:08,222
She said that Steven's going to El Paso?

143
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,518
Yeah.

144
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:17,064
I was just wondering
how you feel about that.

145
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:21,527
- I turned it down. End of story.
- Good. Good.

146
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,362
Jesus, God knows I'm relieved.

147
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,829
I needed some time here because
I'm deep into this investigation,

148
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,410
and couldn't do both,

149
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:31,912
so I made a judgment call.

150
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,839
You know that you can talk to me
about things, right?

151
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:44,592
You don't have to go through this alone.

152
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,263
Do you ask me which lead bib
to put on someone

153
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,098
before you nuke them?

154
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,725
Jesus, Marie.

155
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:57,396
I made a decision.
I'm not going through anything.

156
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,607
Doing my job.

157
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,266
- I would like...
- I know. I know.

158
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,028
A condo in Georgetown. I know.

159
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:07,948
If you would let me finish,
I was going to say

160
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:12,286
I'd like to be included. That's all.

161
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:16,498
Don't you worry about my career.
My career is just fine.

162
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,544
Did you not wanna go?

163
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,632
I don't blame you. I just...

164
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:28,093
- Aren't you late for work or something?
- After what happened

165
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,210
it would make perfect sense
for you to not wanna go back.

166
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,897
I'm onto some important stuff
right here, right now.

167
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:37,978
Mexico doesn't have a damn thing to
do with it. Anyone who doubts that...

168
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,397
I mean, I'm doing
some actual good out here,

169
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:43,734
and all I get
are these bullshit accusations!

170
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,904
What, everyone thinks
I'm jerking off on this thing? Fine.

171
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,822
But I'm onto something. I know it.

172
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:51,116
You understand me?

173
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,661
You hear me?

174
00:16:01,501 --> 00:16:04,337
What exactly is this?

175
00:16:09,342 --> 00:16:11,762
I'll tell you what I think it is.

176
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:18,185
A ploy.
A ploy to get me cooking again.

177
00:16:18,351 --> 00:16:19,936
And an obvious one at that.

178
00:16:20,103 --> 00:16:22,063
How do you mean?

179
00:16:22,647 --> 00:16:27,778
As if I would seriously believe
you would hire an addict.

180
00:16:27,944 --> 00:16:30,363
Jesse Pinkman? Recovering or not.

181
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:33,700
You vouched for him previously.
I took you at your word.

182
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:38,663
No. No, no, no. Let me be clear.
Let me be perfectly clear.

183
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:42,834
Jesse was capable of working
under my supervision.

184
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:47,380
Trusting him with a solo venture

185
00:16:47,547 --> 00:16:50,884
well, that's quite another matter.

186
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:54,471
How he could possibly produce anything

187
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:57,641
other than a mediocre product at best.

188
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:01,311
I am told his product
was more or less consistent

189
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:04,189
with the quality I had come to expect.

190
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,733
More or less?

191
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:10,403
More or less? Really?

192
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:16,535
Boy, that is the...
Talk about setting the bar low.

193
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:23,416
Except you don't do that,
set the bar low.

194
00:17:25,043 --> 00:17:30,006
Therefore,
what conclusion am I left to draw?

195
00:17:31,007 --> 00:17:35,512
That you believe I have some
proprietary kind of selfishness

196
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,848
about my own formula.

197
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:43,520
Some sort of overweening pride, I suppose

198
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:48,441
that you think simply overwhelms me

199
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,403
clouds my judgment.

200
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,198
- But it doesn't.
- Absolutely not.

201
00:17:55,615 --> 00:17:58,201
I simply respect the chemistry.

202
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,957
The chemistry must be respected.

203
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,920
I apologize for being so transparent.

204
00:18:11,923 --> 00:18:17,429
Would you take a drive with me?
I'd like to show you something.

205
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,515
Hi. Is everything okay?

206
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:06,144
She's already finished an entire bottle,
but she still seemed hungry.

207
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,812
Then she fell asleep.

208
00:19:07,979 --> 00:19:10,857
But I was thinking I'd give her another
when she wakes up.

209
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:13,109
Yeah, yeah, absolutely, absolutely.

210
00:19:13,276 --> 00:19:16,738
- Fatten that baby up.
<i>- Will do.</i>

211
00:19:22,243 --> 00:19:23,286
Was that it?

212
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,622
So where are you? Are you at work?

213
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:29,334
<i>Yeah. Yeah, I'm at work.
I shouldn't be much longer.</i>

214
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,963
<i>- Is that okay?</i>
- You know I love my little pookums.

215
00:19:33,129 --> 00:19:35,579
You can leave her with me
for the next 18 years

216
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:37,717
as far as I'm concerned.

217
00:19:37,884 --> 00:19:41,638
Great. Thanks, Marie.

218
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:47,268
Are you sure you're okay?

219
00:19:48,561 --> 00:19:52,399
<i>Sweetie, what is it? Come on.</i>

220
00:19:52,565 --> 00:19:56,736
- It's Hank.
<i>- Hank? What about him?</i>

221
00:19:56,903 --> 00:20:02,075
I don't know how to talk to him.

222
00:20:02,283 --> 00:20:06,037
I don't know what to say to him
anymore. I don't know how to...

223
00:20:06,204 --> 00:20:11,376
Ever since El Paso, ever since...
Maybe before...

224
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:16,172
Yeah. God knows
he went through a lot down there.

225
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:20,719
People blown up right in front of him,
blood everywhere,

226
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:25,181
and last week,
El Paso said they want him back.

227
00:20:25,348 --> 00:20:26,391
<i>Yeah?</i>

228
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:30,395
He's not going. Steve Gomez
is going in his place,

229
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:34,691
and I don't know how I feel about that.

230
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,069
Well, he's certainly a lot safer up here,
isn't he?

231
00:20:38,236 --> 00:20:41,948
<i>Of course, and I want him safe.</i>

232
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:46,411
But I can't tell what he wants.
He won't talk to me.

233
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,570
He hardly even comes home.
He works all day, all night.

234
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:52,292
Barely eats, barely speaks to me.

235
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:55,462
<i>It's like something's
eating him away from inside.</i>

236
00:20:55,628 --> 00:20:59,591
He's just not the same. He's not.

237
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:05,305
Facing death, it changes a person.
It has to, don't you think?

238
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:09,434
I guess you've noticed a change in Walt.

239
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,675
Please.

240
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,753
What is this?

241
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:05,258
Your new lab.

242
00:23:42,378 --> 00:23:44,881
My God.

243
00:23:55,642 --> 00:24:00,729
Thorium oxide for a catalyst bed.

244
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:06,486
Look at the size of this reaction vessel.

245
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:10,823
Oh, it's got...
It's gotta be 1200 liters.

246
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,161
Where...? Where...?

247
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:19,499
How did you know
how to put this all together?

248
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:23,461
I had excellent help, as will you.

249
00:24:26,589 --> 00:24:29,008
Quite a lot of planning went into this.

250
00:24:29,592 --> 00:24:31,552
I would say so.

251
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:35,598
The laundry upstairs,
I've owned it for years.

252
00:24:35,764 --> 00:24:38,685
It receives large chemical deliveries
on a weekly basis

253
00:24:38,851 --> 00:24:40,186
detergents and such.

254
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:43,356
There is nothing suspicious about it,

255
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:48,486
and my employees, to be sure,
are well-trained, trustworthy.

256
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:52,115
The filtration system
is state-of-the-art.

257
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:55,535
It will vent nothing
but clean, odorless steam

258
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:57,537
just as the laundry does,

259
00:24:57,704 --> 00:25:00,581
and through the very same stacks.

260
00:25:01,165 --> 00:25:07,463
I need 200 pounds per week
to make this economically viable.

261
00:25:08,881 --> 00:25:11,081
You would choose your own hours,
of course

262
00:25:11,217 --> 00:25:13,344
come and go as you please,

263
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:15,972
so long as the quota is met.

264
00:25:36,617 --> 00:25:38,411
Sorry.

265
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:41,414
The answer is still no.

266
00:25:46,835 --> 00:25:52,091
I have made a series
of very bad decisions,

267
00:25:52,258 --> 00:25:54,594
and I cannot make another one.

268
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,721
Why did you make these decisions?

269
00:25:57,263 --> 00:25:59,265
For the good of my family.

270
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:03,269
Then they weren't bad decisions.

271
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:08,566
What does a man do, Walter?

272
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:14,447
A man provides for his family.

273
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,450
This cost me my family.

274
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:20,286
When you have children,
you always have family.

275
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:23,790
They will always be your priority,
your responsibility.

276
00:26:23,956 --> 00:26:28,669
And a man... A man provides.

277
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:34,467
And he does it
even when he's not appreciated,

278
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,219
or respected,

279
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,597
or even loved.

280
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:44,435
He simply bears up, and he does it

281
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,106
because he's a man.

282
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:11,296
Any chance we could grab a quick bite?

283
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,091
Thai place around the corner's
pretty good.

284
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:17,845
I really gotta head home.

285
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:21,014
All right, rain check, then.

286
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:44,246
She said it was the tofu.

287
00:27:47,124 --> 00:27:50,544
Whatever. She's still cute anyways.

288
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:58,051
Great dinner, Mom.

289
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,767
Can I be excused?

290
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,562
To do homework or to play video games?

291
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,355
I can multitask.

292
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:13,734
Yeah.

293
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,618
You wanna take her?

294
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,462
Yeah.

295
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:18,442
Give me something, Andy. Come on.

296
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:29,536
Welded onto the back of a house.
Well, that's classy.

297
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,039
Christ.

298
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:35,959
Okay. Okay, thanks.

299
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,806
Hey, Janice. Janice.

300
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,352
That the last one?

301
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,397
Sorry, Hank. That's all DMV had.

302
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:01,568
Twenty-nine early '80s Bounders
registered in New Mexico.

303
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:05,697
- Could you check again?
- Now?

304
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:09,743
- Can I do it after the party?
- Janice, I'm...

305
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,411
I'm dead in the water here.

306
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,581
Okay, I'll check.

307
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,922
Hey, how are you guys doing?

308
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,513
Oh, yeah, I'm gonna clean it
really good, I tell you.

309
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,264
All good.

310
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:34,559
- Gomey.
- Yeah.

311
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:37,854
Time for the little bird to fly the nest,
huh?

312
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:42,609
The right guy for the job, seeing as
the bean-speak comes natural and all.

313
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:46,071
Wanna know how to say
"get bent" in Spanish?

314
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,782
Just don't go native on me, all right?

315
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,122
Hey.

316
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:58,041
Here.

317
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:02,295
Know your enemy and all.

318
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:14,641
- Fight the good fight, brother.
- I will.

319
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:18,895
Who got a drink around here?

320
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:31,950
Your hunch was right. One more RV.

321
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:34,327
DMV said the registration wasn't renewed,

322
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:38,582
but then they realized it was never
filed as non-operational or destroyed.

323
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:41,126
No police report, either.

324
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:10,882
I just don't know what the hell
I'm doing anymore, you know?

325
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:13,760
It's like I'm paralyzed

326
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:16,346
like if I take a step in any direction

327
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:21,351
I'm gonna make a spectacular mistake.

328
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:26,273
God, I could go
for a glass of wine about now.

329
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,858
You wanna go to...?

330
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:30,443
Sorry, never mind.

331
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:35,282
Anyway

332
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:39,953
breaking news is
I am sleeping with my boss,

333
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,872
and I don't know why.

334
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,375
Yep.

335
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:53,383
That's a lie. I do know why.

336
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,138
I mean, he's a lovely guy.

337
00:34:58,305 --> 00:35:01,808
He's a really good person,

338
00:35:01,975 --> 00:35:05,103
but, I mean,
it's not like we're ever gonna...

339
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:10,942
Somehow, and I can't actually believe it,

340
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:16,156
but my entire family
sees me as some sort of...

341
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:20,660
My own sister, my brother-in-law.

342
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:24,080
My teenage son

343
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,416
tells me I'm a bitch.

344
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:31,254
And you say tell him the truth.

345
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:35,008
Tell him about his father,

346
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:37,927
but I can't.

347
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,221
Ever.

348
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:42,640
How could I?

349
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,226
And this man that I'm seeing, you know

350
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:47,686
as wrong as I know it is

351
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:51,112
as much as I know I'm probably
doing it to make Walt leave me

352
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:57,989
it is the only thing in my day
where I don't feel...

353
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,619
like I'm

354
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:06,039
drowning.

355
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:12,837
So he knows about this other man?

356
00:36:13,338 --> 00:36:14,464
Yeah.

357
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:17,801
So then he'll sign?

358
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:23,139
Walt says he's not going anywhere,

359
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:27,769
so that's a really brilliant
gambit on my part. Yep.

360
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,146
Genius.

361
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,491
He keeps money in the house.

362
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,246
Your husband, the drug dealer?

363
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:48,540
How much money?

364
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:53,044
I didn't count it. It's heavy.

365
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:58,174
A bag, where he keeps it.

366
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:03,388
Are you asking my permission
to spend this money?

367
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,682
No. God, no. I just...

368
00:37:05,849 --> 00:37:08,184
No, I'm just, you know...

369
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:11,771
I'm just trying to just talk it through.
That's...

370
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,138
Let me just say
that I'm half as qualified,

371
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:18,111
and twice the price of a therapist.
There is nothing to discuss here.

372
00:37:18,278 --> 00:37:22,282
I'm just saying, you know?
We have a history.

373
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,368
He's the father of my children,

374
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:28,288
and maybe what he did, he...

375
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:30,623
He did it for the family. Right?

376
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:32,792
Well, guess what.

377
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,628
That is one enormous load of horse shit.

378
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,130
Okay.

379
00:37:37,297 --> 00:37:40,133
I'm going to spell this out
as simply as I can for you.

380
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:45,472
You are a fool to stay in that house
one minute longer.

381
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,974
If your husband won't leave, then you go.

382
00:37:48,141 --> 00:37:50,393
You are now an accessory after the fact.

383
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,811
You are culpable.

384
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:54,981
You, your children,
you could lose everything you own.

385
00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:57,108
Do you understand?

386
00:37:57,484 --> 00:38:02,280
All courtesy of this criminal
you refuse to divorce.

387
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:07,327
- I didn't marry a criminal.
- Well, you're married to one now.

388
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:29,201
How about we run through this
one more time

389
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:32,167
especially where I do the talking,
you don't say jack?

390
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:35,248
Oh, I'm gonna say jack.
I'm gonna say plenty.

391
00:39:35,457 --> 00:39:38,710
What did we say about escalating,
huh? Who's got your back here?

392
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:41,421
Me, all right?
I'm going to take care of things.

393
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:44,925
Hey, what are the parameters
of this sobriety thing you got going?

394
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:47,176
- What do you mean?
- Can you take a Xanax?

395
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,429
Because I got a drawer full of them.

396
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:52,766
I get them from my "chiropractor."

397
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:57,854
Vietnamese, 5-foot tall.
She adjusts you to "completion."

398
00:39:58,897 --> 00:40:00,732
Her name's Kim Nu Suong

399
00:40:01,942 --> 00:40:04,903
as delicious as it sounds.

400
00:40:05,112 --> 00:40:07,447
I should give you her card.

401
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:10,033
Hell with this. I'm out of here.

402
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,952
<i>He's here.</i>

403
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,413
Send him in.

404
00:40:19,584 --> 00:40:22,712
Hello, Walt. Good to see you.

405
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:26,758
Please, have a seat here.

406
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:29,469
Mr. Pinkman, if you will.

407
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:32,889
You're late.

408
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:36,101
Gentlemen, if we could come
to some accommodation here now.

409
00:40:36,268 --> 00:40:38,770
There's always a way
to oil everyone's lock.

410
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:42,816
This young man is prepared
to offer you a sweetheart of a deal,

411
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:46,319
- for doing precisely nothing.
- Really?

412
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:51,283
Ten percent of all future profits
from his solo venture.

413
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:55,495
That's money you get paid
for walking down to the mailbox.

414
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:59,332
Consider it a gesture of respect
for your valuable contribution

415
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:03,336
to the business thus far.
I'm sure you'll agree that's fair.

416
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:06,590
That's charity, is what that is.

417
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:08,300
I do all the work.

418
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:11,303
He sits around on his fat ass
judging people.

419
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:15,140
Escalating. Stop.

420
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:18,935
So there's that,
but then there's one small detail.

421
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:22,355
Clearly a mistake was made
on the part of our mutual associate

422
00:41:22,564 --> 00:41:25,150
when he paid you half
of Jesse's earnings.

423
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:28,917
He must not have realized that you
two had come to a parting of the ways.

424
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,823
Take it. It belongs to you.

425
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,159
You're damn right it belongs to me.

426
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:37,704
I knew I could count on you boys
to play nice. That's...

427
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:40,321
- That almost brings a tear to my eye.
- Enjoy it.

428
00:41:40,457 --> 00:41:42,792
Spend it in good health.

429
00:41:43,084 --> 00:41:47,589
That is the last money
you'll ever earn in this business.

430
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:50,383
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

431
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:57,515
Well, I hate to break it to you, Jesse,
but our mutual associate

432
00:41:57,682 --> 00:42:01,728
was only using you to get to me.

433
00:42:01,895 --> 00:42:03,245
What are you talking about?

434
00:42:03,396 --> 00:42:07,859
See, he needs someone with expertise

435
00:42:08,401 --> 00:42:10,737
someone who knows what he's doing.

436
00:42:10,904 --> 00:42:14,532
In other words, he needs me.

437
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:17,244
You're telling me you're cooking again?

438
00:42:17,911 --> 00:42:20,997
Yeah.
Let's see, how should I put this?

439
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,251
I'm in.

440
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:27,170
You're out.

441
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:32,926
Walt, hold on there.

442
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:36,930
What was the offer, if I may ask?

443
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:42,352
It's 3 million
for three months of my time.

444
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:45,563
You're gonna need that money
laundered. I mean, of course.

445
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,065
What was our deal before?

446
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:49,359
Seventeen percent.
That's a shade high.

447
00:42:49,526 --> 00:42:52,862
Let's settle on an even 15.
That's a nice round number.

448
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:54,072
Five percent.

449
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:55,865
- Fourteen's fair.
- Five.

450
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:57,075
- Thirteen.
- Five.

451
00:42:57,242 --> 00:43:00,287
- Twelve. For old times' sake, 12.
- Five.

452
00:43:00,453 --> 00:43:03,039
I'm a reasonable guy.
It's a short-term deal.

453
00:43:03,206 --> 00:43:06,626
Ten even, but I can't go any lower
and still respect myself.

454
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:07,877
Five.

455
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:11,965
What in the hell just happened?
You're my lawyer, not his.

456
00:43:12,132 --> 00:43:15,593
That's the way of the world, kid.
Go with the winner.

457
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,054
You think this will stop me from cooking?

458
00:43:18,221 --> 00:43:19,764
Cook whatever you like.

459
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:23,893
As long as it's that ridiculous
Chili P or some other dreck,

460
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:27,272
but don't even think
about using my formula.

461
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:30,608
Just try and stop me, bitch.

462
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:23,703
- Yes?
- Hi there, Mrs. Ortega?

463
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:25,872
- Yes.
- Hi, I'm Hank Schrader.

464
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:28,792
I'm with the Drug Enforcement
Administration.

465
00:44:28,958 --> 00:44:32,462
We're interested in an RV that's
registered to your name and address.

466
00:44:33,505 --> 00:44:36,383
- Do you have an RV?
- I did.

467
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:38,385
It was stolen months ago.

468
00:44:39,302 --> 00:44:41,388
Stolen, huh? Yeah.

469
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:45,392
Well, then I'm curious as to why
the theft was never reported.

470
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:48,520
I'm not seeing any records
of it with the police or the DMV.

471
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:51,481
I just didn't get around to it.

472
00:44:51,981 --> 00:44:53,566
May I ask why?

473
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:57,570
I mean, it's a great way
to get the family together,

474
00:44:57,737 --> 00:44:59,239
for an affordable vacation.

475
00:44:59,406 --> 00:45:01,556
It must've been a blow
when it went missing.

476
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,326
It was.

477
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:07,705
Do you have any ideas at all
who might've taken it?

478
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:12,544
I didn't want him arrested.

479
00:45:12,794 --> 00:45:17,173
He ran with a bad crowd,
but he was never a bad person.

480
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:19,882
I thought he could turn his life around.

481
00:45:19,968 --> 00:45:21,818
Who are we talking about,
Mrs. Ortega?

482
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,013
My son.

483
00:45:24,848 --> 00:45:27,225
I'd really like to speak with him.

484
00:45:28,101 --> 00:45:32,272
He's passed away.
He was shot two months ago.

485
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:36,276
- What was your son's name?
- Christian.

486
00:45:36,443 --> 00:45:38,903
Christian Ortega.

487
00:45:40,447 --> 00:45:43,116
Was his nickname Combo?

488
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:54,586
Thanks for this.
I really appreciate it.
