<i>My name is Damien Darhk.</i>

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:06,080
<i>In 2016, I was murdered
by the Green Arrow,</i>

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,640
<i>but I was removed from the timeline
31 years before my death</i>

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,840
<i>by a speedster from the future
named Eobard Thawne.</i>

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:14,440
<i>Together with Malcolm Merlyn,</i>

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,480
<i>the former head
of the League of Assassins,</i>

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,800
<i>the three of us are going
to locate the Spear of Destiny,</i>

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,360
<i>a mystical object
which can rewrite reality itself.</i>

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,040
<i>With the Spear in our possession,</i>

10
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,680
<i>we will change our past
and our future</i>

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,840
<i>and the world as you know it.</i>

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,640
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow<i>...</i>

13
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:35,360
<i>A deep scan reveals that
Captain Hunter's neural architecture</i>

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,440
<i>has been reprogrammed
with a new identity.</i>

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,000
<i>The Longinus Medallion.</i>

16
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,880
Rip!

17
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,360
I know that you're one of the
protectors of the Spear of Destiny,

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,200
and I know that you know
where the other pieces are hidden.

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,920
You're gonna torture me, aren't you?

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,400
I'm not gonna torture you. They are.

21
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,840
{\an5}<i>Star City, eight months ago</i>

22
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,960
{\an5}<i>Damien Darhk, the man
behind tonight's siege of Star City,</i>

23
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,160
{\an5}<i>was killed by the masked vigilante
known as the Green Arrow.</i>

24
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:10,120
{\an5}<i>Amateur cell phone video
captured his final moments,</i>

25
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,800
{\an5}<i>putting an end to the chaos
that has gripped the city.</i>

26
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,240
This is the great Malcolm Merlyn?
I am unimpressed.

27
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,960
Well, he's fallen on hard times,

28
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,520
but this man used to be Ra's al Ghul.

29
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,000
We haven't met. I'm Eobard Thawne.

30
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,720
I'm from the future.

31
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,760
What the hell is going on here?

32
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,880
Excellent question. Here's another.

33
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,760
Do you believe in second chances?

34
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,160
I just watched you die.

35
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,280
Yeah, I hear 2016's not my best year,
but I plan on fixing that.

36
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,480
Yeah, but the question for you,
Malcolm, is

37
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,960
do you wish to see your fortunes
similarly reversed?

38
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,960
- By time travel?
- No. No.

39
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,320
Something much better.

40
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,960
<i>Present Day</i>

41
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,160
- Well?
- No luck. So far.

42
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,960
{\an5}It's not that Captain Hunter's
uncooperative.

43
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,760
{\an5}It's that he's not fully
in possession of his marbles.

44
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,760
{\an5}So he won't tell us where the rest
of the Spear of Destiny is?

45
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,360
It's more like can't.

46
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,960
Which wouldn't be such a problem

47
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,600
{\an5}if you two idiots hadn't lost
the Longinus Medallion.

48
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,600
I seem to remember
you being there as well.

49
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,800
Until you weren't.

50
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,960
I hate when he does that.

51
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,120
If you have something
to say to me, Malcolm,

52
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,000
{\an5}- I suggest you keep it to yourself.
- I'm sorry.

53
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,640
{\an5}- Am I supposed to be afraid of you?
- Oh, I would be.

54
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,640
{\an5}Considering I can kill you
before you even knew I was doing it.

55
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,200
Yes. But then you wouldn't get
what you want.

56
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,680
{\an5}You brought me and Damien
into your little quest for a reason.

57
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,880
Without the Medallion,

58
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,640
{\an5}Hunter is our only way to get
the rest of the Spear.

59
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,720
You need me to get it out of him.

60
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,920
{\an5}- We already tried torture.
- I'm not talking about torture.

61
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,080
I'm talking about hypnosis.

62
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,600
Regression therapy.

63
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,560
Hunter's mind is locked away.
I've got the key.

64
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,480
{\an5}Is this some technique you picked up
with the League of Assassins?

65
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,680
{\an5}The League didn't call me
the Magician for nothing.

66
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,920
Well, be quick about it.

67
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,600
{\an5}Speedsters aren't known
for their patience.

68
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,600
{\an5}What's to keep Hunter's crew
from finding the rest of the Spear

69
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,000
{\an5}before Merlyn finishes
unscrambling Hunter's brain?

70
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,040
{\an5}The workings of the Medallion
are lost to history.

71
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,520
{\an5}Trying to get it to reveal
its secrets will prove difficult.

72
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,080
{\an5}Plus we have
an additional advantage over them.

73
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,400
Enlighten me.

74
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,760
They're idiots.

75
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,720
{\an5}- You're all idiots.
- Excuse me?

76
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,920
Pot, meet kettle.

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,960
{\an5}Yeah, Mick. Given your glass house,
you shouldn't throw stones.

78
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,040
Mixing metaphors isn't going
to solve anything.

79
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,920
{\an5}How about, instead of bickering,
we figure out our next move

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,720
against the speedster and his allies?

81
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,320
"Legion of Doom"
has a sexier ring to it.

82
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,040
I'm not calling them that.

83
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,560
And we need to figure out
a way to rescue Rip.

84
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,040
{\an5}All you gotta do is trade the Amulet,
or the Medallion,

85
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,080
{\an5}for the Englishman.
It's really simple.

86
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,760
The only thing is
I don't know how it works.

87
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,960
You're an idiot.

88
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,160
You want to put an artifact
that can rewrite reality

89
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,240
into the hands of the enemy,
and we're the idiots?

90
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,120
Our priority has to be identifying
this speedster.

91
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,480
Of course you'd say that.

92
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,840
{\an5}I mean, he is the one
that killed your boyfriend, so...

93
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,920
He's at the center of this,

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,440
and you can't defeat an enemy
that you don't know.

95
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,760
Look, Amaya's right.

96
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,720
And I hate to say it, but so is Mick.

97
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,800
- I'm not an idiot.
- I'm not an idiot.

98
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,440
Not about being idiots.

99
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,760
{\an5}About using the Medallion
as leverage.

100
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,960
{\an5}But first, we need to figure out
how it works.

101
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,800
{\an5}Well, in my defense,
it's a mystical object.

102
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,240
It doesn't come with
a set of instructions.

103
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,400
Maybe's that been the problem,

104
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,960
approaching it
from a mystical vantage

105
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,440
{\an5}instead of leaning into
our strengths, which are...

106
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,800
{\an5}- Technological.
- Exactly.

107
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,400
{\an5}And, as it happens,
I have a colleague in Central City

108
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,600
{\an5}whose knowledge might prove
to be advantageous.

109
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,080
{\an5}Gideon, set a course
for Central City, 2017.

110
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,480
Jax, stick with Martin.

111
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,280
{\an5}And let's work on putting
a name to our speedster.

112
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,720
Here comes a man who looks like
he just struck out.

113
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,360
Don't get smug with me, Damien.

114
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,680
I may not have all my prior
resources, but at least I'm not dead.

115
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,400
Look, I couldn't get
Hunter to remember

116
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,240
because his memories
aren't buried or locked away.

117
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,200
They're gone.
It's like his old self didn't exist.

118
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,760
Are you sure about that?

119
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,080
Do you think you can do any better?
You are welcome to try.

120
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,160
- We already tried torture.
- You know what I love about torture?

121
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,760
I'm not sure if you have enough time
for me to list all the reasons,

122
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:54,520
but, mainly, it's because
there's always another gear to find!

123
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,920
This is what I get for relying
on a washout and a dead man.

124
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,720
I don't like that guy.

125
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,720
You know, I'll be honest.

126
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,080
Which, I have to admit,
I don't have much practice in.

127
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,360
I don't like this situation.

128
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,160
Not one bit.

129
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,400
For one thing, Mr. Thawne has this
habit of treating me like a henchman.

130
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,680
Do you know what all henchmen
have in common,

131
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,360
Captain Hunter?

132
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,080
No thoughts on this one?

133
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,720
The thing that all henchmen have in
common is that they all end up dead.

134
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,920
A fate that I am fastidiously
trying to avoid.

135
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,040
Maybe it's that I just hate
taking orders.

136
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,560
Or being threatened.

137
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,880
You don't like being threatened,
do you?

138
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,840
What's that? Oh, sorry.

139
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,560
- Oh, God. No.
- Yeah, neither do I.

140
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,720
Which is why I need your cooperation.

141
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,120
To end Mr. Thawne's tedious threats.

142
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,400
Look, I don't know anything. I swear.

143
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,880
I can't take your word for it.
But don't worry.

144
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,720
I will start you off
with an easy question.

145
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,640
Right eye or left eye?

146
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,600
No, please. Please, don't.

147
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,120
I'll do anything. I'll tell you
anything you want to know

148
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,080
even if I don't know it!
Please, don't!

149
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,040
Second question.

150
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,600
When was the last time
you had any dental work done?

151
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,200
What? No. No, God.

152
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,920
It may not be in the best condition,
but then again,

153
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,400
- Captain Hunter is British.
- You pulled out his tooth?

154
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,560
As torture goes,
isn't that kind of bush league?

155
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,640
- Look closer.
- Thank you, but no.

156
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,000
There're some markings on here,
like a barcode.

157
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,400
Account information.

158
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,880
From a security deposit box
in Switzerland.

159
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,040
Who puts that kind of information
on a tooth?

160
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,920
A Time Master.
That's no ordinary security box.

161
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,400
My thinking exactly.

162
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,160
Now, it's possible the box could
contain his son's birth certificate

163
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,360
and the like, but given
the exotic nature of the care

164
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,200
that's been taken here,
I would have to assume...

165
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,440
It's the rest of the Spear.

166
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,880
- When was it last accessed?
- January 2025.

167
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,840
Oh, you got somewhere to go?

168
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,480
Funny, just like clockwork.

169
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,960
Take the Time Sphere back to 2025
and secure the rest of the Spear.

170
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,000
The next one of you who screws up
will lose more than just a tooth.

171
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,840
Well, I'd hate to see you lose
another hand, Malcolm.

172
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,320
<i>Central City 2017</i>

173
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,760
<i>Seriously, Grey?</i>

174
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,200
I know you didn't bring me to 2017

175
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,400
just so we could get lattes
and Frappuccinos, man.

176
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,480
Of course not.

177
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:57,160
Just my colleague merely frequents
this establishment at this hour.

178
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,440
Sorry, Jefferson.
You should go back to the Waverider.

179
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,960
I can handle things from here.

180
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,640
What the hell is going on with you,
man?

181
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,800
Dad?

182
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,960
I didn't know
you were coming to town.

183
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,000
- Dad?
- Well, I wanted to surprise you.

184
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,360
Wait. Your colleague
is your daughter?

185
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,760
Lily, this is my friend Jefferson.

186
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:16,000
Jefferson, this is my daughter.

187
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,080
- Nice to meet you.
- Hey.

188
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,560
- Should we sit down?
- Yeah.

189
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,680
- Over here.
- This is so weird.

190
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,720
Because I didn't think
I'd get the chance to meet you.

191
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:31,120
Like, ever. But here we are.

192
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,040
I was explaining to Jefferson

193
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,280
how you might be able
to assist us with the...

194
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,920
Research project.

195
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,560
- Sort of like <i>Indiana Jones</i>.
- Yeah, sort of.

196
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,400
You brought it to a coffee shop?

197
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,920
Oh, well, for one thing,

198
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,680
it's throwing off
low levels of ionic radiation.

199
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,120
Is that an ionic transmographer?

200
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,000
I've never seen one
smaller than a house!

201
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,880
Yeah, I had an idea
for hyperminiaturization

202
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,200
when I was in Tahiti.

203
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,120
I don't vacation well.

204
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:07,280
You know, I'm thinking
a shortwave ionic pulse might...

205
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,520
Hey.

206
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,040
Perhaps we should take
our little research project

207
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,920
somewhere a bit more private.

208
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,600
A temporal navigation vessel? I...

209
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,920
I absolutely cannot believe it.

210
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,360
- Hello, who are you?
- Oh, hi. Hi, I'm Lily.

211
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,920
I'm Martin's daughter.

212
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,800
We didn't know Martin had a daughter.

213
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,120
Yeah, you told me
you didn't have kids.

214
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,400
Well, I like to keep
my private life private.

215
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,120
There's private, and there's lying.
Sara, did you know about this?

216
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,600
Oh, I know all about this.

217
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,040
- What are you doing?
- Trying to make up my mind.

218
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,480
I mean, Eobard has such a delicious
selection of killing devices.

219
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,080
We can't just storm into the bank
and demand to see the deposit box.

220
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,800
We absolutely can. We're former
members of the League of Assassins.

221
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,200
This operation requires subtlety,
not a bloodbath.

222
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,000
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm not up on current events,

223
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,760
but might this squeamishness
that I'm witnessing

224
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,400
be the cause of your downfall?

225
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,680
Hunter is an asset,

226
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,440
one that we can use
to gain access to our objective.

227
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,720
To not use him is foolish.

228
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,360
Well, in that case,
I would have to defer

229
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,200
to your superior expertise
in foolishness.

230
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,080
But if your plan goes south,

231
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,440
it's not our speedster friend
you need to worry about.

232
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,000
One thing I hate more
than taking orders from him...

233
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,360
is being threatened by you.

234
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,280
Luckily, Damien...

235
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,920
I don't find you threatening.

236
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,200
What's the big deal?

237
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,840
The professor didn't have a kid.
Now he does.

238
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,600
- Mazel tov.
- Thank you.

239
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,440
The big deal is Lily
is a time aberration,

240
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,280
which was all well and good

241
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,160
until you plucked her out of 2017
and showed her a time ship,

242
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,480
which could cause more aberrations.

243
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,600
- Hey, what you looking at me for?
- Because you were with him.

244
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,640
I quite simply missed my daughter.

245
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,120
If Lily's presence on the Waverider
posed any temporal issues,

246
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,760
I'm sure Gideon
would have detected them.

247
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:28,440
Plus Grey said Lily could hook
the Medallion up with Gideon, so...

248
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,960
Wait, she wants to try networking
an ancient amulet

249
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,440
with an advanced AI system?

250
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,920
I'm totally helping.

251
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,280
Fine. Then I would appreciate it
if you...

252
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,120
if none of you would reveal to her
that she's an aberration.

253
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,640
Why you looking at me?

254
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,680
So where are we on identifying
the speedster?

255
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,640
I think the technical term
is "nowhere."

256
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,680
All the speedsters the Flash faced
are either dead or his friends.

257
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,640
Or people he thought were his friends
and are now dead.

258
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,720
Okay, we will figure this out.
And in the meantime,

259
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,240
you and Lily keep working
with the Amulet to figure out

260
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,760
where the rest of the Spear is.

261
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,400
Who's to say he won't kill us anyway

262
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,800
even after we've gotten
his precious spear?

263
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,760
Oh, forget it. Why am I asking you?

264
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,560
I don't know, man.
I don't know anything.

265
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,960
I don't even know why you're getting
me to wear this... this monkey suit.

266
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,680
- And my mouth is so sore.
- Quit whining.

267
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,760
The fact of the matter is
we have something in common, Rip.

268
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,800
- My name is Phil.
- Whatever.

269
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,120
We are both dealing
with unstable individuals,

270
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,600
and that is not something I enjoy.

271
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,680
Hey, this is not exactly
a walk in the park for me either.

272
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,920
Which is why...

273
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,040
you will do exactly as I say.

274
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,880
And maybe, just maybe,

275
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,640
you will make it through this alive.

276
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,720
Cool. Right.

277
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,800
What is it you want me to do?

278
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,720
Tell me, Phil.
Have you ever been to Switzerland?

279
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:56,040
<i>Zurich 2025</i>

280
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,280
Put this in your ear.

281
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,440
- What is it?
- Communication device.

282
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,520
Really? It's so small.

283
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,560
Do it,
or I'll shove it down your throat.

284
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,360
It will allow us to monitor you.

285
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,640
This is very simple.

286
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,680
You go to the bank associate,

287
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,880
and you tell them you want
to access security box 4587.

288
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:21,080
4587, right. What do I do then?

289
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,120
Bring the contents of said box
back to us.

290
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,920
- If you don't, you'll be killed.
- Really?

291
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,920
What? I'm motivating him.

292
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,960
In and out. Take no longer
than five minutes.

293
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,480
- You will be fine.
- I'll be fine.

294
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,280
I'll be fine. Okay.

295
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,920
This would be easier
if we just killed everybody.

296
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,240
Hi, how are you?
I'd like box 4587, please.

297
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,640
Well, sure. Have a seat.

298
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,280
What do you think's going on
with him?

299
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,680
It's simple. His mind is pudding.

300
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,240
Not Hunter. Thawne.

301
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,920
It's strange how he never stays
in one place for very long.

302
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,640
Perhaps that's why they refer
to them as speedsters.

303
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,920
What, you think he left us behind
in 1967 Los Angeles

304
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,280
because he had
a more pressing engagement?

305
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,040
What about
what he said to us earlier?

306
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,560
- That he wanted to kill one of us?
- No.

307
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,760
That he didn't know
why he was relying on us.

308
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,640
I mean, fair question.

309
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,720
Why does a time-traveling speedster
need to rely on anyone?

310
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,440
Thawne's hiding something.

311
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,000
Wouldn't you like to know what it is?

312
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,520
Thawne said we knew each other
back in 2016.

313
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,880
Do I really become so stupid

314
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,600
that you think these mind tricks
will work on me?

315
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,000
- I am not trying to...
- In a trio such as ours,

316
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,720
turning one against each other
for your own benefit

317
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,640
is not only obvious but cliché.

318
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,120
Thawne does not treat us
as equals to him.

319
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,240
And until he does, neither of us
is getting what he wants.

320
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:46,440
- All right. Let's go over this again.
- Already been over it, Sara.

321
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,680
- Again and again.
- And again.

322
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,960
We're obviously dealing
with a new player.

323
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,520
Whoever this speedster is,

324
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,800
it's someone you and your friends
haven't encountered before.

325
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,800
Which means the speedster's
from the future,

326
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,360
which makes sense because
speedsters can time-travel.

327
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,760
Then what would the speedster
need the Spear of Destiny for?

328
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,080
He could just go back
and change history himself.

329
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,920
But not reality.
That's why he needs the Spear.

330
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,400
Question is what is the speedster
trying to change?

331
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,960
Or fix?

332
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,400
That's the question.

333
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,920
He knows what we want to do
with the Spear of Destiny,

334
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,520
but he's being very coy
about his plans.

335
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,760
Very well, Mr. Hunter.

336
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,760
Please lean towards the panel,
if you would.

337
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,400
- Excuse me?
- A retinal scan.

338
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,320
- Rectal scanner?
- What?

339
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,240
It's an eye scan.
Part of the bank's security.

340
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,120
You know, this whole situation sucks,
but, man, I love being in the future.

341
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,320
- What?
- What?

342
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,600
Retinal scan. Right.

343
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,920
Why...

344
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,880
Why is it not working?

345
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,680
Voice ID is next.
You need to speak your access code.

346
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,920
- Access code.
- Oh, boy.

347
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,200
Oh, boy.

348
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,360
Yes, so the one you set
when you opened your account.

349
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,800
<i>- Get out of there now.</i>
- Yeah.

350
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,320
No, don't.

351
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,360
<i>- Go. Move.
- Don't.</i>

352
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,800
- This was your plan.
- Which I am trying to execute.

353
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,480
And failing spectacularly, per usual.

354
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,360
Look, we can't just let them
call security.

355
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,760
I'm calling security.

356
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,880
Great idea. Security, no, that's...
Security is awesome.

357
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,520
You weren't planning on going rogue
on us, now, were you, Rip?

358
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,400
I have told you. My name is Phil.

359
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,000
All right, Phil.
It was lovely knowing you.

360
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,480
- Don't! We still need him.
- He's useless to us.

361
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,200
Hey, I can be more useful.

362
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,520
Damn it. Security's gonna be
on top of us at any moment.

363
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,880
Might I suggest
you kill them instead?

364
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:05,160
Try and run, and I will find you
and feed you your testicles.

365
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,240
Okay.

366
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,120
Oh, my God.

367
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,320
- Reinforcements are on their way.
- Let's get the hell out of here.

368
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,560
{\an5}<i>Polizei</i>

369
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,360
Okay, that should just about do it.

370
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,080
And now we just have
to activate the Medallion

371
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,000
and see if Gideon can access
its data.

372
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,080
Okay.

373
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,320
So what are we waiting for?

374
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,400
Nothing, it's just if...

375
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,040
if we've underestimated the size
of the artifact's data stream...

376
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,600
We'll fry the ship's CPU,

377
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,160
and we'll all spend the rest of our
lives stranded in the temporal zone?

378
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,080
<i>- The ship's CPU has a name.</i>
- Sorry, Gideon.

379
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,360
<i>Can we at least talk about this
before you connect...</i>

380
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,080
Gideon?

381
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,360
You still there?

382
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,200
Oh, my God, we killed her.

383
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,680
<i>Artificial intelligences cannot,
by definition, be killed, Dr. Palmer.</i>

384
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,800
Yes, I know.

385
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,000
It's pretty remarkable considering
we just mainlined 1.2 zettabytes

386
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,320
- directly into her brain.
- Yeah.

387
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,280
<i>I'm processing the Medallion's
temporal output as we speak.</i>

388
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,520
- Nice work, Doctor.
- Doctor!

389
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,080
You don't happen to have
any champagne on this ship, do you?

390
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,760
Hey.

391
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,800
1998 Blanc de Noir.

392
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,000
I like beer.

393
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,160
Gets me drunk.

394
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,160
- To Lily.
- To Gideon.

395
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,520
That tastes real.

396
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,840
It's completely synthetic.

397
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,760
The food fabricator
can make anything.

398
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,960
Except American cheese, which is
pretty much synthetic to being with.

399
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,840
Beluga caviar?

400
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,080
Fake food never tasted so good.

401
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,200
Fake food for a fake person.

402
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,560
- What did you say?
- No. He didn't say anything.

403
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,200
Everyone has been looking at me weird
ever since I came on board this ship.

404
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,000
What are you not telling me?

405
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,840
Cat's out of the bag, Haircut.
You may as well tell her.

406
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,840
Tell me what? Tell me what?

407
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,800
Sweetheart, I don't wanna rain
on your parade, but you're a...

408
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,960
How would the professor put it?

409
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,520
An abrasion... No, that's not it.

410
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,200
An asphyxiation...

411
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,960
Aberration. You're a time aberration.
You're a time aberration.

412
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,200
Ray?

413
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,400
What is a time aberration?

414
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,200
I think maybe you should talk
to your dad.

415
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,400
Perhaps we could all just talk
about what went wrong.

416
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,160
Oh, I know what went wrong.
I listened to him.

417
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,240
If you'd have listened to me,

418
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,720
we would have walked out of that bank
instead of being chased out.

419
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,440
Either way,
we came out empty-handed.

420
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,400
I seem to remember Eobard mentioning

421
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,480
how he was going to punish
your failure.

422
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,200
If anyone's a failure, it's you.

423
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,680
You were the one who learned
about Hunter's secret account

424
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,840
yet seem not to know
about a passcode.

425
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,600
Sloppy, Damien.

426
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,440
No wonder
they passed you over for Ra's.

427
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,040
You see, this is where he reminds me
that he was Ra's al Ghul.

428
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,000
Poor Malcolm.
Always living in the past.

429
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,720
This is when I remind you
about your future.

430
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,640
That's right. I've been there.

431
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,760
I've seen how pathetic you are.

432
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:55,560
In this future that you're from,
do I at least have two hands?

433
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,120
Either way, I intend to change
my future, but look at you now.

434
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,400
You're pathetic.

435
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,760
I don't even know why Thawne
recruited you in the first place.

436
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,400
We could argue all night, Damien, but
I don't want to bore our guest here

437
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,360
with your impotent insults
and recriminations.

438
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,320
What are you suggesting?

439
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,800
You recall how we resolved disputes
within the League?

440
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,120
Now...

441
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,440
I suggest you choose a blade

442
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,240
that matches
that sharp tongue of yours.

443
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,720
Excuse me for a second.

444
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,320
Gladly.

445
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,200
You did it, my darling!

446
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,760
You created an interface
between a mystical relic

447
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,360
from the first century
and a 22nd-century supercomputer.

448
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,160
Only a Stein could be so brilliant.

449
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,000
- What is a time aberration?
- I'm sorry, what?

450
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,120
You heard me, Dad.

451
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,880
An aberration
is an unnatural alteration of history

452
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,000
as a result of time travel.

453
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,320
Dad?

454
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,560
Am I...

455
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,400
Am I an aberration?

456
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,280
That word could never describe
who you are

457
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:04,400
or how much you mean to me.

458
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,440
- So it's true?
- Please let me explain.

459
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:10,120
That's why you were acting so weird

460
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,680
when you visited Central City
the first time.

461
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,040
The reason you were treating me
like a stranger...

462
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,320
Was because you didn't even exist
the last time I boarded this ship

463
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,880
and left 2016.

464
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:22,800
But now you do exist,
and that's all that matters.

465
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,480
- How could this be happening?
- But it's really quite simple.

466
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:30,720
You see, I interacted with
my younger self back in 1987,

467
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,560
who then interacted with
your mother's former self, and...

468
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,320
when two former selves
love each other...

469
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,240
Okay, Dad, we've already had
the birds and bees talk.

470
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,320
I was ten.

471
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,040
- Or did we?
- That's a very interesting point.

472
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,480
I mean, who is to say
which of our realities is real

473
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,640
and which one is aberrant?

474
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:53,080
It's really a matter of perspective.
Actually, it's quite fascinating.

475
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,320
This is not fascinating, Dad.

476
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,520
This is a nightmare.

477
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,960
Oh, Lily, I'm so sorry.

478
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,840
This is not how I wanted you
to find out.

479
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,560
No. No, I get it.

480
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,160
You didn't want kids when you
first came on board this time ship.

481
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,240
And now you have me.

482
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,240
- You just reminded me of something.
- Which is?

483
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,960
How much I've missed this.

484
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,520
Okay, stop, stop! Time-out, time-out!

485
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,280
Can't you see that
this is what your boss wants?

486
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,800
For his underlings to be
at one another's throats.

487
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,840
Like, literally.

488
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,120
- He is not our boss.
- Did he call us underlings?

489
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,320
Oh, I'm sorry.

490
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,840
- Henchmen.
- Try again.

491
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,120
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
What if he's right?

492
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,080
Oh, you actually care what this
pudding-brained hippie has to say?

493
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,760
It's just like the movie
<i>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</i>.

494
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,680
Three bad guys.
No one knows who to trust,

495
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,880
so they all end up
screwing each other over.

496
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,280
It's an interesting theory.
Which one are we?

497
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,400
The point is that neither of you
are Clint Eastwood,

498
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,800
and so neither of you end up
going home with the gold.

499
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,000
- We're not after the gold.
- I know. Yeah, I know. I know.

500
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,960
I know what you're after.
You, you wanna change your past.

501
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,640
And you, you wanna change
your future.

502
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,320
And the fast guy is the only one
who can make those two things happen.

503
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,800
I told you.
Thawne doesn't treat us as equals.

504
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,200
Even the hippie knows it.

505
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,920
And he also knows that
the only way to stop Thawne

506
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,640
from screwing us over
is for us to work together.

507
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:12,360
Two former members of the League
of Assassins versus a speedster.

508
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,840
I am liking those odds.

509
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,600
Dude, what is going on with you?

510
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,080
What do you mean?
And don't call me dude.

511
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,040
I've gotten used to sharing
a brain with you,

512
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,840
but this, whatever this is,
this is something new.

513
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:36,120
Just enjoying a cup of Earl Grey.

514
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,000
- Is that whiskey?
- Of course it's not whiskey.

515
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,320
It's brandy. What do you
take me for, a sailor?

516
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,160
Okay. Let's start this over.

517
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,560
Come on.

518
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,040
Fine.

519
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,120
I made a terrible mistake.

520
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,600
I should never have brought
Lily on board this ship.

521
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,720
She found out.

522
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,480
She knows she's an aberration.

523
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:06,120
Mr. Rory spilled the beans,
as predicted.

524
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,000
So what you gonna do?

525
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,240
What can I do?

526
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,280
- Just tell her how you feel.
- She knows how I feel.

527
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,960
- It goes without saying.
- Yeah, for us, it does.

528
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,160
We have a psychic connection,
but for her?

529
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,280
She just hears whatever
comes out of that big brain of yours.

530
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,400
Just tell her you love her.

531
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,240
That's what dads do.

532
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,680
Clearly, you never met my father.

533
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,920
You know, the...

534
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,120
the reason Clarissa and I
chose not to have children

535
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,920
the first time around was because...

536
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,840
I feared that history
would repeat itself,

537
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,840
that I would be the kind of father
that he was.

538
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,200
We're Legends, Grey.

539
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,920
Changing history is what we do.

540
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,440
Why would a speedster
need to change reality?

541
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,720
How many times
are you gonna ask that question?

542
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,160
Until we have an answer.

543
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,120
She's right.
Speedsters can time-travel,

544
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,560
so what's stopping him from changing
history even without the Spear?

545
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,800
Unless he doesn't exist.

546
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,320
Okay, so what, he's a ghost?

547
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,400
What if he's a temporal aberration,
just like...

548
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,160
Excuse me. Have any of you
seen my daughter?

549
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,280
- One second, Professor.
- Sorry, this is quite urgent.

550
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,960
Look, what if instead of creating
a person like you did with Lily,

551
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,480
our mystery speedster
erased himself from history?

552
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,000
Why would he want to do that?

553
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,320
I don't know, but it would explain

554
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,160
why we don't have
any evidence of his existence.

555
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,400
Okay, so we just need to ID
someone who doesn't exist.

556
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,040
Eobard Thawne.

557
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,400
- Is he okay?
- I'm fine.

558
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,000
Eobard Thawne is a name,

559
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:56,800
- the name of a speedster who...
- Who what?

560
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,040
<i>Thawne was erased from existence
when his progenitor,</i>

561
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,880
<i>Eddie Thawne, committed suicide
in order to stop him.</i>

562
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,840
Which would explain why the Time
Masters didn't have a file on him.

563
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,600
But if Thawne doesn't exist,
then how?

564
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,280
He was protected
from his ancestor's death

565
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,120
because he was a member
of the Speed Force.

566
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,600
- It's a little complicated.
- A little?

567
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,640
<i>Zurich 2025</i>

568
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,560
<i>Lindgren Banking Securities</i>

569
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,760
Oh, and for the record,

570
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:28,120
this is how I wanted to approach
things in the first place.

571
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,400
Only because you enjoy killing
a lot of people.

572
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,600
As if you don't.

573
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,400
<i>Access granted</i>

574
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,920
All right, that's pretty impressive,
Malcolm,

575
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,520
but how did you get
Hunter's passcode?

576
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,680
It's not Hunter's.

577
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,520
It's the bank manager's
security override code.

578
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,240
It only cost him three fingers.

579
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,960
Yes!

580
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,240
Oh, God.

581
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,760
- Going somewhere?
- No.

582
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,160
Yes. What do you expect me to do?

583
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,240
Your partners just left me here
all tied up.

584
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,520
Where are they?

585
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:19,400
They told me not to tell you.

586
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,000
The bank. They're at the bank.

587
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,720
Look, you could help yourself to
whatever is in that safe deposit box,

588
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,960
but please, please, just let me go,
man. Let me go.

589
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,480
Does this look like a spear to you?

590
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,520
It most certainly does not.

591
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,360
It's a mnemonic archive.

592
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,040
I'm sorry. Are we supposed
to know what that means?

593
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,360
Since it won't be invented
for a century, no.

594
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,600
This device is designed
to store memories.

595
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,240
Rip Hunter's, I'd assume.

596
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,800
Guys, I think I just figured it out.

597
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,240
Why a seemingly invincible speedster
would need to take on partners.

598
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,280
By all means, Dr. Heywood,
please enlighten us.

599
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,760
Okay. What if Thawne
isn't just chasing us?

600
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:16,480
- What if he's running from something?
- But running from what?

601
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,320
- Time.
- Time takes time to harden.

602
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,920
And if Thawne ceased
to exist the moment

603
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,520
his great-great-whatever
killed himself,

604
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:27,400
then maybe he has to keep moving
in order for his own nonexistence

605
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,400
not to catch up with him.

606
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,680
That doesn't even begin to make
any kind of sense.

607
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,080
I don't know. It could work.

608
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,960
Professor, what do you think?

609
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:39,760
Per the scientific method,
there's only one way to prove it.

610
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:44,200
You'd have to trap Thawne in
one place and then see what happens.

611
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,160
What do you think you're doing?

612
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,360
Renegotiating the terms
of our partnership.

613
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,400
And it is going to be a partnership.

614
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,880
We need a bit more of a guarantee

615
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,600
that you're going to uphold
your end of our bargain.

616
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,840
I'll guarantee you one thing.

617
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,320
If you don't open that door...

618
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,800
I'll kill you.

619
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:11,240
Yes, but I'm the only one
who knows the code to open it.

620
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,920
Perhaps you can persuade
our friend to cooperate.

621
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,280
Me? No. I'd rather see
how this plays out.

622
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,240
It seems you two
have formed an alliance.

623
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,040
There's just one problem.

624
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,400
That you're the only one who can
give us what we want. Yes, we know.

625
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:30,840
You're always so quick to remind us
how much we need you, Eobard.

626
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,120
But, clearly, you need us.

627
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,800
You could have gotten in this vault
all by yourself. Why didn't you?

628
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,480
And for that matter, why would a man
who can travel through time

629
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,000
- always be in such a hurry?
- We don't have time for this.

630
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,880
Oh, I've got all the time
in the world.

631
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,240
Okay! Okay, you two
have made your point.

632
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,240
I need you as much as
you need me, all right?

633
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,560
But if you do not open that door,
he is going to kill us.

634
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,080
He is coming for me!

635
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,880
- Who's coming for you?
- It's not a who.

636
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,360
It's a... a what? A thing.

637
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,840
What thing?
Can you be a little more specific?

638
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:15,280
My ancestor killed himself in
an effort to erase my very existence.

639
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,720
Well, you look pretty spry
despite it.

640
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,600
The Flash pulled me
from the timeline.

641
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:22,400
He held me captive for months,
and when I finally got loose,

642
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,520
I found myself pursued by something.

643
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,360
I thought it was a time wraith,

644
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,720
the monsters that hunt speedsters
who mess with time.

645
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:37,280
But whatever is hunting me
is far worse than a time wraith.

646
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,560
It can sense the Speed Force.

647
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,040
And it's trying to kill me.

648
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,320
Interesting. So that's why you
keep running out on us.

649
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,720
So you're kind of like a shark
who'll die if you stay in one place.

650
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,840
We are all going to die
if you don't...

651
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,840
It's too late. It's here.

652
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,200
Well, the good news is you two
finally got what you wanted.

653
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,800
You managed to balance
our partnership.

654
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,960
- We're now all equally dead.
- Oh, I wouldn't worry about that.

655
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,960
This isn't the first scary speedster
that we had to put in his place.

656
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,920
We're gonna get you out
of this bank vault, Eobard.

657
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,080
But on one condition.

658
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,320
You stop treating us like lackeys.

659
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,440
You think you can stop that?
Good luck!

660
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,640
Was that a yes?

661
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
- Yes.
- Great. Let's go to work.

662
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,200
Right, so you say this thing
is attracted to the Speed Force?

663
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,920
What if you don't use it?

664
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,520
- What are you suggesting?
- That you stop running.

665
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:54,280
- It knows I'm here.
<i>- Good.</i>

666
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,000
<i>Because we've only got
one shot at this.</i>

667
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:07,040
Remember, as long as you stay still,
he can't sense you.

668
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,960
Easy, Eobard.

669
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,560
Easy.

670
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,960
It won't stay trapped for long.
We have to go.

671
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,040
We?

672
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,440
We...

673
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,760
- Partners.
- Better.

674
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,520
Gideon, can you please take
the ship back to Central City?

675
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,640
<i>If your goal is to return to 2017,</i>

676
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,400
<i>I'm afraid your father
has instructed me</i>

677
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,840
<i>not to permit you to leave the ship.</i>

678
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,920
Well, considering he never wanted
to be my father,

679
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,320
that should draw his parental
dictates into question, wouldn't it?

680
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,280
You share my fondness for erudition.

681
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,760
You truly are my daughter.

682
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,280
Well, I am sorry about that.

683
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,720
No, I'm... I'm the one who's sorry.

684
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,840
For what?

685
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,640
It's not your fault I'm a mistake.

686
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,680
I've made many mistakes
in my life, Lily,

687
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:00,360
but you most certainly
are not one of them.

688
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,280
The apology that I owe you
is for not telling you

689
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,240
about the unique circumstances
of your conception.

690
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,080
You didn't want me to know
that you didn't want me.

691
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:15,120
No, you're right. I...

692
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:18,000
I didn't want children.

693
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:25,480
But if there's one thing my travels
aboard the Waverider have taught me,

694
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:29,160
it's that time often doesn't
provide us with what we want.

695
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:33,000
But it's quite adept at giving us
what we need.

696
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,240
And I needed you in my life...

697
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:44,760
in ways that I could never even
dare to imagine.

698
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,760
I just don't want there to be
any more secrets between us.

699
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,640
Well, in that spirit,
I suppose I should tell you

700
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:03,840
that I am one half of a nuclear-
powered superhero called Firestorm.

701
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,200
So not funny, Dad.

702
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,400
Anyway, as fun as this was,

703
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,600
I probably should be getting home.

704
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,880
- You're sure you can't stay?
- I would. I just...

705
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,800
I'm working on a series
of synthetic proteins

706
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,520
that are not gonna fold
themselves, so...

707
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,400
So then I guess this is goodbye.

708
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,040
Good luck folding those proteins.

709
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,880
Good luck rescuing your friend Rip.

710
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,560
Bye, Dad.

711
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,640
Feel no pressure to tell us
what all this technocrap is about.

712
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,360
We're sure
we can figure it out ourselves.

713
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:10,600
This technocrap,
as you so eloquently put it,

714
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,040
is Captain Hunter's memories.

715
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:16,280
Including the locations of the other
pieces of the Spear, I hope.

716
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,920
That is my working assumption, yes.

717
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,840
All we have to do now is upload
his memories to his cerebral cortex.

718
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,280
And that's not happening now because?

719
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:27,720
Well, we would hardly be doing
Captain Hunter any favors

720
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,160
if we just restored the memories
without taking the liberty

721
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,240
to address some of his shortcomings.

722
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,680
What, like stopping him
biting his nails?

723
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,080
Not exactly.

724
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:42,400
{\an5}<i>New Jersey 1776</i>

725
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:46,880
<i>Christmas Day</i>

726
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,200
Can I help you with something,
soldier?

727
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,160
No, General Washington, I'm fine.

728
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,720
You, on the other hand...
