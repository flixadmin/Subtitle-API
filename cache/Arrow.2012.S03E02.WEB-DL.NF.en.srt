And now that my sister's dead...

Because I get it. Loud and clear.

You are rich. You are impulsive.

You are the creepiest stalker
that I have ever had to deal with.

-Now, what can I do for you?
-You can stop.

You can stop sending me flowers.

00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:00,970
You can stop texting me and calling me
and e-mailing me, because I spam them.

168
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,388
Is spam a verb now?

169
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,391
Because I am never, ever,

Only because you bought the store
that I work at.

-No, I didn't.
-Yes, you did.

My boss just called
and told me that you did.

Well, he's wrong.

Kind of.

176
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:22,492
I bought the holding company
which owns all 20,000 Tech Village stores.

It's all right.

459
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,678
She can rest now. She's home.

460
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:55,242
It's a Jewish custom.

461
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:00,455
I know she wasn't, but it feels right.

462
00:34:41,329 --> 00:34:42,831
Laurel.

463
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:47,127
No, this isn't right.

464
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:51,172
This isn't...
She doesn't even get a fresh grave?

465
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:54,009
It's so perverse.

466
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:56,761
She deserves a proper burial.

467
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:02,434
-She's earned it.
-No, it's not fair.

468
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,895
No one will ever really know who she was.

469
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:11,192
Oliver, it's not fair. It's not fair.

470
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:29,878
Laurel, we'll know.

471
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:34,174
I know this doesn't count for much...

472
00:35:34,341 --> 00:35:36,926
...but me and Lyla,
we're naming the baby Sara.

473
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:41,264
We will never forget.

474
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,516
Thank you.

475
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:03,828
How did I...?

476
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,707
What the hell is going on here?

477
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:08,958
Where am I?

478
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:16,049
Please, please don't hurt me.

479
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:18,385
Look, just let me go, please.

480
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:21,513
I promise, I won't tell anybody about this.

481
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,433
OLIVER [IN DEEP VOICE]: Would a fisherman
throw his prized catch back in the sea?

482
00:36:25,767 --> 00:36:28,103
What are you talking about?

483
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:32,524
Look, whoever you are,
you really don't wanna do this.

484
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:35,694
Do you have any idea who I am?
Who my father is?

485
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,654
OLIVER:
You're Thomas Merlyn.

486
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,990
You've been looking for Oliver Queen.

487
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,784
How do you...? How do you know that?

488
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:45,912
OLIVER: A simple hack
of a missing billionaire's e-mail account.

489
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:52,544
I knew somebody would come looking for him,
but I thought it would be his mother, his sister.

490
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:58,675
But you, the son of the CEO of Merlyn Global,
jackpot.

491
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:03,680
My friend,
you are gonna make me a very rich man.

492
00:37:03,847 --> 00:37:05,682
So Oliver didn't...?

493
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,061
He isn't...?

494
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:14,315
Oliver Queen is dead.

495
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,651
He's rotting at the bottom of the ocean.

496
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:21,197
And you will too...

497
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:24,743
-...if your father doesn't pay that ransom.
MAN: Hong Kong police.

498
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,829
-I'm in here! Please help! Help!
MAN: Hands up.

499
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,998
-Hong Kong police.
-Please, please, please.

500
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:32,083
Please, please, please.

501
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:34,252
Thank you.

502
00:37:34,419 --> 00:37:37,589
-You're going home. You're safe.
-Thank you, thank you.

503
00:37:51,853 --> 00:37:54,355
I'm gonna catch whoever killed her.

504
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,566
I know you are.

505
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,904
And until you do, I'm back on the team.

506
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,324
What about your family?

507
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:07,702
Sara is family, Oliver. Just like you, man.

508
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,875
So now what?

509
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,878
Now I gotta go get Thea.

510
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,884
It's long past time she came home.

511
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:29,724
John.

512
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:37,148
I don't wanna die down here.

513
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,610
So don't, Oliver.

514
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,682
[ELEVATOR BELL DINGS]

515
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,603
-Hey.
-Hi.

516
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:58,563
Changed your mind.

517
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:02,025
I just decided I want more out of life.

518
00:40:35,016 --> 00:40:36,142
Well done.

519
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:43,691
Thanks, Dad.
