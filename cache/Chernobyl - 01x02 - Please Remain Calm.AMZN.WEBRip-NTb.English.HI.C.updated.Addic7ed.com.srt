- Yes, 3.6 roentgen,

172
00:12:48,164 --> 00:12:51,037
An RBMK reactor

173
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:55,329
uses uranium 235 as fuel.

174
00:12:55,331 --> 00:13:00,204
Every atom of U-235 is like a bullet

175
00:13:00,206 --> 00:13:02,412
traveling at nearly the speed of light,

176

penetrating everything in its path:

177
00:13:04,997 --> 00:13:08,204
woods, metal, concrete, flesh.

178
00:13:08,206 --> 00:13:11,371
Every gram of U-235 holds

179
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:14,583
over a billion trillion
of these bullets.

That's in one gram.

Now, Chernobyl holds
over three million grams,

182
00:13:19,247 --> 00:13:21,954
and right now, it is on fire.

not stop firing for 100 years.

207
00:15:38,539 --> 00:15:40,204
How does a nuclear reactor work?

208
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:43,164
- What?
- SHCHERBINA: It's a simple question.

209
00:15:44,498 --> 00:15:46,412
It's hardly a simple answer.

210
00:15:46,414 --> 00:15:50,412
Of course, you presume I'm
too stupid to understand.

211
00:15:50,414 --> 00:15:53,788
So I'll restate: Tell me
how a nuclear reactor works,

212
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:56,665
or I'll have one of these soldiers
throw you out of the helicopter.

213
00:16:06,789 --> 00:16:10,703
A nuclear reactor makes
electricity with steam.

214
00:16:10,706 --> 00:16:14,329
The steam turns a turbine
which generates electricity.

215
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:16,371
Where a typical power plant

216
00:16:16,373 --> 00:16:18,329
makes steam by burning coal,

217
00:16:18,331 --> 00:16:20,665
a nuclear plant...

218
00:16:25,831 --> 00:16:30,496
In a nuclear plant, we use
something called fission.

219
00:16:30,498 --> 00:16:36,537
We take an unstable
element like uranium 235,

220
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:38,682
which has too many neutrons.

221
00:16:38,685 --> 00:16:41,414
- A neutron is, uh...
- The bullet.

222
00:16:43,241 --> 00:16:45,033
Yes, the bullet.

223
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:48,954
So, bullets are flying
off of the uranium.

224
00:16:48,956 --> 00:16:50,371
Now...

225
00:16:50,373 --> 00:16:55,287
if we put enough uranium
atoms close together,

226
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:59,746
the bullets from one atom will
eventually strike another atom.

227
00:16:59,748 --> 00:17:02,913
The force of this impact
splits that atom apart,

228
00:17:02,915 --> 00:17:06,287
releasing a tremendous
amount of energy, fission.

229
00:17:06,289 --> 00:17:09,120
- And the graphite?
- Ah, yes.

230
00:17:09,122 --> 00:17:13,079
The neutrons are actually traveling
so fast... we call this "flux"...

231
00:17:13,081 --> 00:17:17,954
it's relatively unlikely that the
uranium atoms will ever hit one another.

232
00:17:17,956 --> 00:17:22,995
In RBMK reactors, we surround
the fuel rods with graphite

233
00:17:22,997 --> 00:17:27,997
to moderate, slow
down, the neutron flux.

234
00:17:31,221 --> 00:17:33,010
Good.

235

Comrade Shcherbina,
Chief Engineer Fomin,

329
00:24:50,665 --> 00:24:52,704
Colonel General Pikalov, and I

330
00:24:52,706 --> 00:24:54,037
are honored at your arrival.

331
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:55,371
Deeply, deeply honored.

332
00:24:55,373 --> 00:24:58,412
Naturally, we regret the
circumstances of your visit,

333
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:00,663
but, as you can see, we are
making excellent progress

334
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,287
in containing the damage.

335
00:25:02,289 --> 00:25:07,537
We have begun our own inquiry
into the cause of the accident,

336
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:10,621
and I have a list of individuals

337
00:25:10,623 --> 00:25:13,414
who we believe are accountable.

338
00:25:35,162 --> 00:25:37,299
BRYUKHANOV: Professor
Legasov, I understand

339
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:39,454
you've been saying dangerous things.

340
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:41,329
FOMIN: Very dangerous things.

341
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,665
Apparently, our reactor core exploded.

342
00:25:44,331 --> 00:25:48,581
Please, tell me how an
RBMK reactor core explodes.

343
00:25:50,456 --> 00:25:52,871
I'm not prepared to
explain it at this time.

As I presumed, he has no answer.

345
00:25:55,831 --> 00:25:58,412
It's disgraceful, really.

To spread disinformation
at a time like this.

347
00:26:07,956 --> 00:26:10,746
Why did I see graphite on the roof?

348
00:26:10,748 --> 00:26:12,954
Graphite is only found in the core,

349
00:26:12,956 --> 00:26:16,496
where it's used as a
neutron flux moderator.

350
00:26:16,498 --> 00:26:17,915
Correct?

351
00:26:18,873 --> 00:26:22,331
Fomin, why did the Deputy
Chairman see graphite on the roof?

352
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:25,373
Well, that... that can't be.

353
00:26:26,247 --> 00:26:28,995
Comrade Shcherbina, my
apologies, but graphite...

354
00:26:28,997 --> 00:26:30,287
that's not possible.

355
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:32,474
Perhaps you saw burnt concrete.

356
00:26:32,477 --> 00:26:34,496
Now there you made a mistake,

357
00:26:34,498 --> 00:26:37,204
because I may not know
much about nuclear reactors,

358
00:26:37,206 --> 00:26:38,831
but I know a lot about concrete.

359
00:26:39,665 --> 00:26:42,164
- Comrade, I assure you...
- I understand.

360
00:26:42,997 --> 00:26:45,704
You think Legasov is wrong.

361
00:26:45,706 --> 00:26:47,665
How shall we prove it?

362
00:26:48,956 --> 00:26:52,287
Our high-range dosimeter just arrived.

363
00:26:52,289 --> 00:26:55,329
We could cover one of our
trucks with lead shielding,

364
00:26:55,331 --> 00:26:57,665
mount the dosimeter on the front.

365
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:06,746
Have one of your men get as
close to the fire as he can.

366
00:27:06,748 --> 00:27:08,496
Give him every bit of
protection you have.

367
00:27:08,498 --> 00:27:10,871
But understand that
even with lead shielding,

368
00:27:10,873 --> 00:27:12,873
it may not be enough.

369
00:27:14,706 --> 00:27:16,581
Then I'll do it myself.

It means the core is open.

It means the fire we're
watching with our own eyes

is giving off nearly twice the radiation

One of the atomic reactors

543
00:41:55,539 --> 00:41:58,204
at the Chernobyl Atomic Power
Plant near the city of Kiev

is speculation in Moscow

that people were injured

Nuclear fuel doesn't turn cold

simply because it is not on fire.

632
00:50:10,539 --> 00:50:12,245
In fact, the temperature
will likely rise

633

as a result of the blanket
of sand we've dropped.

634

00:50:30,915 --> 00:50:33,287
I believed there was time to reinforce

640
00:50:33,289 --> 00:50:35,412
this lower concrete pad

641
00:50:35,414 --> 00:50:36,954
before the lava reached the earth

642
00:50:36,956 --> 00:50:38,579
and contaminated the groundwater.

643
00:50:38,581 --> 00:50:41,746
But as it turned out, I was
worried about the wrong thing.

644
00:50:41,748 --> 00:50:43,704
Uh, um...

645
00:50:43,706 --> 00:50:47,371
It was my understanding
that these large water tanks

646
00:50:47,373 --> 00:50:50,037
under the reactor
were essentially empty.

647
00:50:50,039 --> 00:50:53,204
This is Ulana Khomyuk of
the Byelorussian Institute.

648
00:50:53,206 --> 00:50:55,579
Thanks to her insight, we are now aware

649
00:50:55,581 --> 00:50:58,954
that the tanks are, in fact, full.

650

Of water. Why is that
a problem, professor?

651

(CLEARS THROAT)

652
00:51:07,122 --> 00:51:08,871
When the lava enters these tanks,

653
00:51:08,873 --> 00:51:11,601
it will instantly superheat and vaporize

654
00:51:11,604 --> 00:51:15,037
approximately 7,000
cubic meters of water,

655
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:18,621
causing a significant thermal explosion.

656
00:51:18,623 --> 00:51:20,663
How significant?

657
00:51:20,665 --> 00:51:24,621
We estimate between
two and four megatons.

658
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:27,995
Everything within a 30-kilometer radius

659
00:51:27,997 --> 00:51:29,746
will be completely destroyed,

660
00:51:29,748 --> 00:51:33,162
including the three remaining
reactors at Chernobyl.

661
00:51:33,164 --> 00:51:36,746
The entirety of the radioactive
material in all of the cores

662
00:51:36,748 --> 00:51:39,913
will be ejected at force

663
00:51:39,915 --> 00:51:43,037
and dispersed by a massive shock wave,

664
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:48,329
which will extend
approximately 200 kilometers

665
00:51:48,331 --> 00:51:51,704
and likely be fatal to the
entire population of Kiev

666
00:51:51,706 --> 00:51:53,829
as well as a portion of Minsk.

667
00:51:53,831 --> 00:51:56,829
The release of radiation will be severe

668
00:51:56,831 --> 00:52:00,162
and will impact all of Soviet Ukraine,

669
00:52:00,164 --> 00:52:03,871
Latvia, Lithuania, Byelorussia,

670

as well as Poland,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary,

Romania, and most of East Germany.

672
00:52:13,539 --> 00:52:16,414
What do you mean "impact"?

673
00:52:17,206 --> 00:52:19,829
For much of the area, a
nearly permanent disruption

674
00:52:19,831 --> 00:52:22,454
of the food and water supply,

675

of cancer and birth defects.

there will be, but many.

677

For Byelorussia and the Ukraine,

678
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:33,454
"impact" means completely uninhabitable

679
00:52:33,456 --> 00:52:36,873
for a minimum of 100 years.

680
00:52:40,706 --> 00:52:44,204
There are more than 50 million people

681
00:52:44,206 --> 00:52:47,037
living in Byelorussia and Ukraine.

682
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:48,873
Sixty, yes.

683
00:52:53,247 --> 00:52:55,079
And how long before this happens?

684
00:52:55,081 --> 00:52:58,956
Approximately 48 to 72 hours.

685
00:53:02,414 --> 00:53:04,913
But we may have a solution.

686
00:53:04,915 --> 00:53:06,788
We can pump the water from the tanks.

687
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:10,287
Unfortunately, the tanks are
sealed shut by a sluice gate,

688
00:53:10,289 --> 00:53:12,496
and the gate can only be opened manually

689
00:53:12,498 --> 00:53:14,120
from within the duct system itself.

690
00:53:14,122 --> 00:53:17,371
So we need to find three plant workers

691
00:53:17,373 --> 00:53:19,037
who know the facility well enough

692
00:53:19,039 --> 00:53:20,746
to enter the basement here,

693
00:53:20,748 --> 00:53:25,079
find their way through
all these duct ways,

694
00:53:25,081 --> 00:53:27,245
get to the sluice gate valve here,

695
00:53:27,247 --> 00:53:31,788
and give us the access we
need to pump out the tanks.

696
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:34,621
Of course, we will need your permission.
