1
00:00:00,483 --> 00:00:01,996
No. I'm still looking.

2
00:00:02,723 --> 00:00:05,112
You know, Lois, I wanted to ask you
about that artic...

3
00:00:05,283 --> 00:00:08,639
Hey, I'm gonna run downstairs
for some fresh air. Great!

4
00:00:21,843 --> 00:00:23,481
Thanks.

5
00:00:30,963 --> 00:00:33,602
- Let's talk when I get back.
- Sure.

6
00:01:24,923 --> 00:01:27,562
You know, you really
shouldn't smoke, Miss Lane.

7
00:01:30,723 --> 00:01:33,112
- Sorry. Didn't mean to startle you.
- I'm fine. Really.

8
00:01:35,163 --> 00:01:38,155
I just wasn't expecting you.

9
00:01:38,803 --> 00:01:40,316
With all the press on the plane...

10
00:01:40,483 --> 00:01:42,792
...I wasn't sure it was
the best time for us to talk.

11
00:01:42,963 --> 00:01:46,000
Well, there's no press around now.
Except for me, of course.

12
00:01:48,123 --> 00:01:50,478
I know people are asking questions
now that I'm back.

13
00:01:50,843 --> 00:01:54,233
I think it's only fair
that I answer those people.

14
00:01:55,843 --> 00:01:59,040
So you're here for an interview?

15
00:02:00,243 --> 00:02:01,232
Okay, then.

16
00:02:04,963 --> 00:02:06,874
- Where did I put that thing?
- Right pocket.

17
00:02:12,763 --> 00:02:15,357
Let's start with the big question.

18
00:02:15,523 --> 00:02:17,912
- Where'd you go?
- To Krypton.

19
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,358
But you told me it was destroyed.
Ages ago.

20
00:02:20,523 --> 00:02:21,922
It was.

21
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,358
But when astronomers
thought they found it...

22
00:02:25,763 --> 00:02:28,038
...I had to see for myself.

23
00:02:31,523 --> 00:02:35,198
Well, you're back, and everyone
seems to be pretty happy about it.

24
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:39,682
Not everyone.

25
00:02:40,803 --> 00:02:43,112
- I read the article, Lois.
- So did a lot of people.

26
00:02:43,283 --> 00:02:46,116
- Tomorrow they're giving me the Pulitzer...
- Why did you write it?

27
00:02:47,723 --> 00:02:49,679
How could you leave us like that?

28
00:02:51,123 --> 00:02:53,432
I moved on. So did the rest of us.

29
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,356
That's why I wrote it.

30
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:58,196
The world doesn't need a savior.

31
00:02:58,603 --> 00:03:00,434
And neither do I.

32
00:03:14,963 --> 00:03:15,998
Lois.

33
00:03:17,643 --> 00:03:19,998
Will you come with me?

34
00:03:21,683 --> 00:03:23,196
Why?

35
00:03:23,563 --> 00:03:25,599
There's something I wanna show you.

36
00:03:31,603 --> 00:03:33,321
Please.

37
00:03:43,883 --> 00:03:45,953
I can't be gone long.

38
00:03:46,123 --> 00:03:47,954
You won't be.

39
00:03:59,843 --> 00:04:02,482
Clark said the reason you left
without saying goodbye...

40
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:04,838
...is because it was
too unbearable for you.

41
00:04:05,003 --> 00:04:07,517
Personally, I think that's a load of crap.

42
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:11,120
- Clark?
- He's just a guy I work with.

43
00:04:12,163 --> 00:04:14,199
Maybe Clark's right.

44
00:04:17,443 --> 00:04:19,479
You know, my...

45
00:04:19,643 --> 00:04:24,478
Richard, he's a pilot.
He takes me up all the time.

46
00:04:25,603 --> 00:04:27,514
Not like this.

47
00:04:41,763 --> 00:04:44,072
I forgot how warm you were.

48
00:05:13,443 --> 00:05:14,876
Listen.

49
00:05:15,723 --> 00:05:17,554
What do you hear?

50
00:05:18,243 --> 00:05:19,437
Nothing.

51
00:05:23,203 --> 00:05:24,875
I hear everything.

52
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:30,717
You wrote that the world
doesn't need a savior...

53
00:05:32,003 --> 00:05:35,200
...but every day
I hear people crying for one.

54
00:05:47,523 --> 00:05:50,083
I'm sorry I left you, Lois.

55
00:05:53,803 --> 00:05:55,759
I'll take you back now.

56
00:08:03,443 --> 00:08:05,001
Richard's a good man.

57
00:08:08,283 --> 00:08:10,399
And you've been gone a long time.

58
00:08:12,963 --> 00:08:14,476
I know.

59
00:08:19,043 --> 00:08:20,317
I...

60
00:08:25,323 --> 00:08:27,234
So will I see you around?

61
00:08:28,203 --> 00:08:30,114
I'm always around.

62
00:08:31,363 --> 00:08:33,001
Good night, Lois.

63
00:08:51,203 --> 00:08:54,912
We're having beef, honey. Do you want
the tofu wrap or the veggie wrap?

64
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,193
You all right?

65
00:09:02,127 --> 00:09:03,313
Where have you been?

66
00:09:07,912 --> 00:09:12,161
I was up on the roof, getting some air.

67
00:09:13,154 --> 00:09:15,031
Tell the truth now.

68
00:09:21,314 --> 00:09:22,429
Were you smoking?

69
00:09:24,954 --> 00:09:26,626
No.

70
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,223
Is this real?

71
00:09:37,234 --> 00:09:39,031
- Where'd you find him?
- He found me.

72
00:09:39,194 --> 00:09:41,867
Oh, this is great. I can't wait to read it.

73
00:09:42,034 --> 00:09:44,343
So, Mr. White, about the blackout...

74
00:09:44,514 --> 00:09:46,903
Lois, this is the biggest night
of your life.

75
00:09:47,074 --> 00:09:49,144
Have you picked out a dress?
Something snazzy?

76
00:09:50,114 --> 00:09:52,708
It just feels a little weird
winning for that article.

77
00:09:52,874 --> 00:09:55,786
- It just doesn't seem right.
- What doesn't seem right?

78
00:09:55,954 --> 00:09:59,390
Winning an award for an article called
"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman."

79
00:09:59,554 --> 00:10:01,909
When, according
to this newspaper, they do.

80
00:10:02,074 --> 00:10:04,872
Lois, Pulitzer Prizes
are like Academy Awards.

81
00:10:05,034 --> 00:10:08,026
Nobody remembers what you got one for.
It's just that you got one.

82
00:10:08,194 --> 00:10:11,186
- But...
- This is your night. You enjoy it.

83
00:10:11,354 --> 00:10:13,788
I'm sure Kent's on the blackout.

84
00:11:11,874 --> 00:11:13,990
Department of Water and Power, please.

85
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:15,902
7782, great.

86
00:11:17,314 --> 00:11:18,747
Metropolis Public Works.

87
00:11:18,914 --> 00:11:21,303
Hi, Stephen, Lois Lane
from the <i>Daily Planet.</i> Blackout?

88
00:11:21,474 --> 00:11:24,068
I just need a little info
on a few outstanding power grids.

89
00:11:24,234 --> 00:11:25,792
<i>Yeah, I do have it here, actually.</i>

90
00:11:25,954 --> 00:11:29,788
<i>So the uptown grid went dark at 12:36</i>
<i>and midtown 10 seconds before.</i>

91
00:11:29,954 --> 00:11:31,387
Which grid was hit first?

92
00:11:31,554 --> 00:11:32,828
<i>It just reads Vanderworth.</i>

93
00:11:32,994 --> 00:11:35,269
- Across the river?
- <i>6 Springwood Drive.</i>

94
00:11:35,434 --> 00:11:37,584
6 Springwood Drive.
A residence or a business?

95
00:11:37,754 --> 00:11:39,426
- <i>Residence.</i>
- Sure? Nothing before that?

96
00:11:39,594 --> 00:11:41,824
- <i>That's all it shows.</i>
- Thank you very much.

97
00:11:43,594 --> 00:11:44,822
Oh, Jason.

98
00:11:51,354 --> 00:11:54,426
- There's your mom, Jason.
- You're late, Mommy.

99
00:12:02,314 --> 00:12:05,033
Where are we? Is this the Pulitzer?

100
00:12:05,194 --> 00:12:09,312
Nope. I've just gotta ask these people
a few questions and then we can go.

101
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,309
Can I stay in the car?

102
00:12:25,834 --> 00:12:27,347
No, honey.

103
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:37,952
- Are we trespassing?
- No. Yes.

104
00:12:52,074 --> 00:12:53,826
Hello?

105
00:13:24,034 --> 00:13:25,513
Hello?

106
00:13:36,154 --> 00:13:38,622
I like the curly one.

107
00:13:45,634 --> 00:13:48,353
Let's go. This was a bad idea.

108
00:14:03,434 --> 00:14:05,152
Lex Luthor.

109
00:14:07,074 --> 00:14:09,110
Lois Lane?

110
00:14:14,674 --> 00:14:15,948
You're bald.

111
00:14:35,234 --> 00:14:36,553
And what is your name?

112
00:14:36,714 --> 00:14:39,069
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.

113
00:14:39,554 --> 00:14:41,431
- Cute kid, and smart.
- Thanks.

114
00:14:41,594 --> 00:14:44,666
We're not really strangers, are we?
This is kind of a little reunion.

115
00:14:44,834 --> 00:14:46,790
Heck, I'm a fan.

116
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:48,387
I love your writing...

117
00:14:49,194 --> 00:14:50,946
...and your dress.
- I love your boat.

118
00:14:51,114 --> 00:14:53,628
How'd you get it?
Swindle some widow out of her money?

119
00:14:54,914 --> 00:14:57,064
That's funny. Didn't you win
the Pulitzer Prize...

120
00:14:57,234 --> 00:15:00,670
...for my favorite article of all time, "Why
the World Doesn't Need Superman"?

121
00:15:00,834 --> 00:15:04,588
Didn't you have a few more years to go
on that double life sentence?

122
00:15:04,754 --> 00:15:06,904
Yes, well, we can thank
the Man of Steel for that.

123
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:10,225
I mean, he's really good at swooping in
and catching the bad guys...

124
00:15:10,394 --> 00:15:13,784
...but he's not so hot at the little things,
like Miranda rights...

125
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:18,470
...due process, making your court date.

126
00:15:18,634 --> 00:15:20,989
Did you have anything to do
with the blackout?

127
00:15:23,874 --> 00:15:25,990
Are you fishing for an interview,
Miss Lane?

128
00:15:26,154 --> 00:15:28,224
It's been a while
since you've been a headline.

129
00:15:28,394 --> 00:15:30,464
Maybe it's time
people knew your name again.

130
00:15:31,114 --> 00:15:34,902
How about we turn this boat around,
call a cab for my son...

131
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:37,948
...and then you can do
whatever you want with me.

132
00:15:38,634 --> 00:15:41,068
No, I don't think we'll be
turning around, Miss Lane...

133
00:15:41,234 --> 00:15:43,748
...which means that
we do have some time to kill.

134
00:15:45,834 --> 00:15:47,631
How about that interview?

135
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:51,711
Yeah, just call me if you hear anything.
Okay. Thank you.

136
00:15:51,874 --> 00:15:53,512
So, what did the school say?

137
00:15:53,674 --> 00:15:55,107
She picked him up at 3:15.

138
00:15:59,194 --> 00:16:02,345
- Hi, I heard about Lois.
- Yes, come in, Clark, come in.

139
00:16:02,514 --> 00:16:04,903
- Is there anything I can do?
- Yeah, you're a reporter.

140
00:16:05,074 --> 00:16:07,713
- Help Richard track her down.
- I'll check her computer.

141
00:16:07,874 --> 00:16:09,068
Excuse me, Clark.

142
00:16:22,234 --> 00:16:25,192
What do you know about crystals?

143
00:16:25,354 --> 00:16:26,992
They make great chandeliers.

144
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:32,344
This crystal may seem unremarkable,
but so is the seed of a redwood tree.

145
00:16:32,514 --> 00:16:35,790
It's how our mutual friend in tights
made his Arctic getaway spot.

146
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,751
Cute. It's a little small for my taste.

147
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,393
You're building an island?

148
00:16:40,554 --> 00:16:43,751
You're not seeing
the big picture here, Miss Lane.

149
00:16:43,914 --> 00:16:46,109
Let me enlarge it for you.

150
00:16:48,594 --> 00:16:51,870
Not just an island,
an entirely new continent.

151
00:16:52,034 --> 00:16:55,151
An extinct world, reborn on our own.

152
00:16:55,314 --> 00:16:56,667
Why?

153
00:16:59,554 --> 00:17:01,385
Land, Miss Lane.

154
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:04,193
I mean... Kitty, what did my father
used to say to me?

155
00:17:04,354 --> 00:17:05,707
"You're losing your hair"?

156
00:17:06,674 --> 00:17:08,505
- Before that.
- "Get out"?

157
00:17:09,994 --> 00:17:12,189
He said, "You can print money...

158
00:17:12,354 --> 00:17:14,868
...manufacture diamonds,
and people are a dime a dozen...

159
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,992
...but they'll always need land."

160
00:17:18,154 --> 00:17:20,873
It's the one thing
they're not making any more of.

161
00:17:21,394 --> 00:17:23,669
But the United States...

162
00:17:25,314 --> 00:17:28,670
Will be underwater.

163
00:17:29,074 --> 00:17:30,587
It's simple physics, Miss Lane.

164
00:17:30,754 --> 00:17:33,427
Two objects cannot occupy
the same space at the same time.

165
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,028
And the rest of the world
will just let you keep it?

166
00:17:36,194 --> 00:17:38,310
- They'll...
- They'll...

167
00:17:38,794 --> 00:17:40,193
...what?

168
00:17:40,354 --> 00:17:43,107
I'll have advanced alien technology...

169
00:17:43,274 --> 00:17:46,186
...thousands of years beyond
what anyone could throw at me.

170
00:17:46,354 --> 00:17:48,310
Bring it on!

171
00:17:49,274 --> 00:17:51,105
And eventually...

172
00:17:51,274 --> 00:17:53,504
...the rest of the world
will be begging me...

173
00:17:53,674 --> 00:17:56,188
...for a piece of high-tech
beachfront property.

174
00:17:56,354 --> 00:17:58,584
In fact, they'll pay
through the nose for it.

175
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,666
But millions of people will die.

176
00:18:00,834 --> 00:18:03,348
Billions! Once again,
the press underestimates me.

177
00:18:03,514 --> 00:18:05,789
This is front-page news.

178
00:18:06,434 --> 00:18:08,345
Come on, let me hear you say it
just once.

179
00:18:08,514 --> 00:18:12,826
- You're insane.
- No! Not that. No, the other thing.

180
00:18:12,994 --> 00:18:16,509
It's dangling off the tip of your tongue.
Let me hear it just once, please?

181
00:18:16,674 --> 00:18:19,552
- Superman will never...
- Wrong!

182
00:18:32,234 --> 00:18:33,792
What is that?

183
00:18:34,954 --> 00:18:37,627
I think you know exactly what this is.

184
00:18:43,394 --> 00:18:46,147
Mind over muscle, Miss Lane.

185
00:18:47,234 --> 00:18:48,952
Mind...

186
00:18:56,194 --> 00:18:58,105
Who is that boy's father?

187
00:18:59,554 --> 00:19:01,351
Richard.

188
00:19:01,794 --> 00:19:05,150
<i>Mr. Luthor, we're approaching</i>
<i>the coordinates.</i>

189
00:19:05,714 --> 00:19:07,227
Are you sure?

190
00:19:07,394 --> 00:19:12,514
<i>Yes, sir. Latitude 40 degrees north,</i>
<i>longitude 73 degrees west.</i>

191
00:19:33,154 --> 00:19:35,224
Don't let them leave this room.

192
00:19:35,554 --> 00:19:38,022
Kitty, come with me.
You're not gonna want to miss this.

193
00:20:48,114 --> 00:20:49,433
- Damn it.
- What?

194
00:20:49,594 --> 00:20:50,743
She has a password.

195
00:20:52,674 --> 00:20:54,187
"Jason."

196
00:20:56,194 --> 00:20:57,832
"Richard."

197
00:20:59,674 --> 00:21:01,187
Try "Superman."

198
00:21:06,114 --> 00:21:08,423
"Superman." Great.

199
00:21:16,434 --> 00:21:18,425
Don't touch that, honey.

200
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:24,869
Why don't you go play the piano.

201
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:19,703
Come on, come on, come on.

202
00:25:02,394 --> 00:25:05,306
Lex, this isn't like the train set.

203
00:25:07,154 --> 00:25:08,826
I know.

204
00:25:14,634 --> 00:25:16,352
Come on, come on.

205
00:25:16,954 --> 00:25:18,103
Come on.

206
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,231
- Honey, are you okay?
- Yeah.

207
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,305
- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

208
00:26:47,474 --> 00:26:50,113
Open this door! Open it!

209
00:27:04,834 --> 00:27:07,109
Could you help Mommy open the door?

210
00:27:09,874 --> 00:27:11,546
I'm sorry.

211
00:27:14,514 --> 00:27:16,505
It's gonna be okay.

212
00:27:16,674 --> 00:27:18,904
Okay? It's gonna be okay.

213
00:27:37,794 --> 00:27:41,104
We had a little problem downstairs.

214
00:27:41,634 --> 00:27:43,704
Brutus is dead.

215
00:27:44,354 --> 00:27:47,471
He got hit with the piano.

216
00:27:51,874 --> 00:27:53,671
Where's the boy?

217
00:27:53,834 --> 00:27:57,793
With the mother,
locked up in the pantry.

218
00:27:59,874 --> 00:28:01,944
Oh, it's time for us to go.

219
00:28:07,714 --> 00:28:10,103
My camera's not working.

220
00:28:10,874 --> 00:28:12,910
And my phone's not working.

221
00:28:17,754 --> 00:28:20,393
- Okay, I'm good.
- That was weird.

222
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:36,984
Hey, guys.
This just came through the fax.

223
00:28:37,154 --> 00:28:39,349
It's Lois' handwriting,
I'd recognize it anywhere.

224
00:28:39,514 --> 00:28:41,266
I just... No idea
what the numbers mean.

225
00:28:41,434 --> 00:28:43,106
- They're coordinates.
- Coordinates.

226
00:28:45,154 --> 00:28:46,303
That's just off the coast.

227
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:49,466
Jimmy, tell Perry I'm taking the seaplane.
Keep trying her cell.

228
00:30:48,554 --> 00:30:49,953
What are these, lottery numbers?

229
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:52,385
I think they're coordinates, chief.

230
00:31:29,514 --> 00:31:30,629
Chief...

231
00:31:56,434 --> 00:31:58,629
Come on! Move it!

232
00:34:16,434 --> 00:34:18,106
Chief!

233
00:34:28,794 --> 00:34:31,103
Great Caesar's ghost.

234
00:36:32,874 --> 00:36:34,910
- Daddy.
- Oh, my God.

235
00:36:47,954 --> 00:36:49,307
How did you get here?

236
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:51,066
I flew.

237
00:36:54,594 --> 00:36:56,346
Look out!

238
00:37:08,674 --> 00:37:10,312
Mom!

239
00:37:10,474 --> 00:37:12,510
Mom! Mom!

240
00:37:12,674 --> 00:37:13,993
Jason, come here! Jason!

241
00:37:16,754 --> 00:37:18,585
Come here! Watch your head!
Come here!

242
00:38:16,634 --> 00:38:18,352
Mommy! Mom!

243
00:38:20,194 --> 00:38:21,388
Jason!

244
00:38:24,714 --> 00:38:26,147
Jason, hold on!

245
00:38:29,154 --> 00:38:31,714
- Have you got him?
- I got him! Go!

246
00:38:34,034 --> 00:38:35,547
Hold on! Hold on!

247
00:38:49,674 --> 00:38:50,948
- Mommy!
- Give him to me!

248
00:38:51,114 --> 00:38:52,627
Mommy!

249
00:38:53,234 --> 00:38:55,065
- Mommy! Mommy!
- Come on, Jason! Come on!

250
00:38:58,754 --> 00:39:01,473
- Lois! Lois!
- Mommy!

251
00:40:03,314 --> 00:40:05,305
Jason, get on my back.

252
00:40:34,114 --> 00:40:35,706
Give me your hand.

253
00:40:42,834 --> 00:40:45,029
- Have you got them?
- Yeah.

254
00:41:03,354 --> 00:41:05,185
Get buckled in!

255
00:41:23,434 --> 00:41:25,231
She'll be fine.

256
00:41:27,874 --> 00:41:29,193
I can't take off in this.

257
00:41:29,354 --> 00:41:33,142
- I'll point you in the right direction.
- Thank you.

258
00:42:29,994 --> 00:42:31,712
See anything familiar?

259
00:42:37,474 --> 00:42:39,783
I see an old man's sick joke.

260
00:42:40,274 --> 00:42:43,550
Really? Because I see
my new apartment...

261
00:42:43,714 --> 00:42:46,626
...and a place for Kitty,
one for my friends...

262
00:42:46,794 --> 00:42:49,627
...and that place over there, I'll rent out.

263
00:42:53,954 --> 00:42:57,993
But, you know, maybe you're right.
You know, maybe it is a little cold.

264
00:42:58,154 --> 00:43:01,942
It's... What's the word I'm searching for?
It's a little...

265
00:43:02,554 --> 00:43:04,192
...alien.

266
00:43:05,154 --> 00:43:08,829
It lacks that human touch.

267
00:43:11,674 --> 00:43:14,268
You have something that belongs to me.

268
00:43:31,074 --> 00:43:34,225
Metropolis Tower, this is seaplane
November-Seven-Two-Four-One-Hotel.

269
00:43:34,394 --> 00:43:35,907
Do you copy?

270
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:40,070
Metropolis Tower, this is seaplane
November-Seven-Two-Four-One-Hotel.

271
00:43:40,234 --> 00:43:42,464
Do you copy? Damn it!

272
00:43:42,634 --> 00:43:46,104
Metropolis Tower, this is seaplane
November-Seven-Two-Four-One-Hotel.

273
00:43:46,274 --> 00:43:48,026
Do you copy?

274
00:43:49,834 --> 00:43:52,394
Lois! Are you all right?

275
00:43:52,794 --> 00:43:56,025
Yeah. What happened?

276
00:43:57,114 --> 00:43:59,628
- Superman.
- Where is he?

277
00:44:01,074 --> 00:44:02,268
He went back.

278
00:44:04,794 --> 00:44:06,910
- Richard, we have to turn around.
- What? No.

279
00:44:07,074 --> 00:44:09,588
- We have to turn around!
- We barely made it out of there.

280
00:44:09,754 --> 00:44:12,222
- Now you want me to go back?
- Yes, please!

281
00:44:12,954 --> 00:44:14,706
He'll die.

282
00:44:17,594 --> 00:44:19,391
All right, hold on.

283
00:44:36,194 --> 00:44:37,946
Kryptonite.

284
00:44:42,874 --> 00:44:44,751
You're asking yourself, "How?"

285
00:44:46,474 --> 00:44:51,229
Didn't your dad ever teach you
to look before you leap?

286
00:44:55,114 --> 00:44:57,947
Crystals. They're amazing, aren't they?

287
00:44:58,114 --> 00:45:01,231
They inherit the traits
of the minerals around them...

288
00:45:01,394 --> 00:45:05,990
...kind of like a son
inheriting the traits of his father!

289
00:45:08,674 --> 00:45:13,464
You took away five years of my life,
I'm just returning the favor!

290
00:45:16,834 --> 00:45:19,746
I'm still Superman!

291
00:45:28,034 --> 00:45:31,310
Get up! Come on!

292
00:46:59,594 --> 00:47:01,505
Now, fly.

293
00:48:00,114 --> 00:48:02,947
So long, Superman.

294
00:48:05,314 --> 00:48:08,272
<i>Your leadership can stir others...</i>

295
00:48:08,434 --> 00:48:10,504
<i>...to their own capacities</i>
<i>for moral betterment.</i>

296
00:48:10,674 --> 00:48:13,507
<i>The human heart is still subject</i>
<i>to monstrous deceits.</i>

297
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:19,747
<i>Our destruction could have been avoided.</i>
<i>At this very moment...</i>

298
00:48:19,914 --> 00:48:21,472
<i>...I could embrace you in my arms.</i>

299
00:48:21,634 --> 00:48:23,943
<i>Your help would be called for endlessly.</i>
<i>Remember me.</i>

300
00:48:24,114 --> 00:48:27,311
<i>Even for those tasks which human beings</i>
<i>could solve themselves.</i>

301
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:40,033
<i>Remember me, Kal-El.</i>

302
00:48:40,194 --> 00:48:42,025
<i>Remember me.</i>

303
00:48:50,554 --> 00:48:52,226
Superman's down there.

304
00:48:53,194 --> 00:48:55,469
- You sure?
- Yeah.

305
00:49:05,514 --> 00:49:08,028
- Richard!
- Yeah, I saw him. Strap in.

306
00:49:35,594 --> 00:49:37,312
Lois!

307
00:49:38,594 --> 00:49:40,312
Don't move.

308
00:50:24,514 --> 00:50:26,470
Come on, come on, come on.

309
00:50:30,074 --> 00:50:31,712
Richard!

310
00:50:31,874 --> 00:50:33,193
I'm trying! It's too choppy!

311
00:50:41,954 --> 00:50:43,467
Oh, my God.

312
00:52:26,754 --> 00:52:28,665
How did you find me?

313
00:52:33,954 --> 00:52:35,512
Thank you.

314
00:52:49,874 --> 00:52:51,705
What are you doing?

315
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:55,948
I have to go back.

316
00:52:58,554 --> 00:53:00,226
You're hurt!

317
00:53:10,274 --> 00:53:11,866
Goodbye, Lois.

318
00:54:19,394 --> 00:54:21,624
<i>The technology on Krypton,</i>
<i>Superman's home world...</i>

319
00:54:21,794 --> 00:54:24,024
<i>...was based on manipulating</i>
<i>the growth of crystals.</i>

320
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:25,513
<i>Sounds like hocus-pocus to me.</i>

321
00:54:25,674 --> 00:54:29,349
<i>Well, naturally, to the primitive mind,</i>
<i>any sufficiently advanced technology...</i>

322
00:54:29,514 --> 00:54:31,391
<i>...would be indistinguishable from magic.</i>

323
00:54:31,554 --> 00:54:34,830
<i>But imagine: cities, vehicles, weapons...</i>

324
00:54:34,994 --> 00:54:37,383
<i>...entire continents, all grown.</i>

325
00:54:37,554 --> 00:54:39,226
Lex?

326
00:54:40,994 --> 00:54:43,986
Are billions of people really going to die?

327
00:54:50,234 --> 00:54:51,872
Yes.

328
00:55:18,114 --> 00:55:19,388
Lex, what's happening?

329
00:55:25,114 --> 00:55:26,672
Go, go, go. Get to the helicopter.

330
00:55:29,434 --> 00:55:31,709
Go! Out, out! Now!

331
00:55:34,754 --> 00:55:37,791
No, no, no, take nothing!
Take nothing! Go, go!

332
00:55:39,634 --> 00:55:41,147
Got it.

333
00:56:23,474 --> 00:56:24,987
Here.

334
00:56:47,914 --> 00:56:49,791
- What did you do?
- I'm sorry!

335
00:56:49,954 --> 00:56:51,467
No!

336
00:57:10,234 --> 00:57:13,670
- What did you do?
- I'm sorry!

337
01:01:03,434 --> 01:01:04,867
Watch it.

338
01:01:06,194 --> 01:01:08,310
- Clear a path.
- Clear the way.

339
01:01:08,834 --> 01:01:10,392
- Move!
- Trauma One.

340
01:01:11,714 --> 01:01:13,944
- Where we going?
- Trauma One. Here it is.

341
01:01:19,554 --> 01:01:21,192
Watch it!

342
01:01:28,714 --> 01:01:30,033
Got him!

343
01:01:33,554 --> 01:01:34,873
Okay, I think I got it.

344
01:01:39,274 --> 01:01:41,993
Penetrating side wound
to right part of lower back.

345
01:01:43,274 --> 01:01:44,389
No hemorrhage.

346
01:01:48,874 --> 01:01:50,148
Shock at 200.

347
01:01:50,314 --> 01:01:52,066
Is that enough? He's not human.

348
01:01:52,234 --> 01:01:53,826
All right, charge to three, 360.

349
01:01:53,994 --> 01:01:55,507
Clear!

350
01:02:24,914 --> 01:02:26,142
It's kind of morbid, Perry.

351
01:02:26,954 --> 01:02:29,309
Always be prepared.

352
01:02:31,594 --> 01:02:33,232
How is she?

353
01:02:51,954 --> 01:02:54,832
Thank you. Thanks, baby.

354
01:02:57,514 --> 01:02:58,708
- Lois?
- Yeah.

355
01:03:00,794 --> 01:03:02,625
We can leave whenever you're ready.

356
01:03:02,794 --> 01:03:04,307
I mean...

357
01:03:05,834 --> 01:03:07,745
...you don't have to be here.

358
01:03:08,914 --> 01:03:10,666
Where else would I be?

359
01:03:10,834 --> 01:03:14,224
<i>Police have surrounded the area in order</i>
<i>to control thousands of visitors...</i>

360
01:03:14,394 --> 01:03:16,225
<i>...who have arrived</i>
<i>to show their support.</i>

361
01:03:16,394 --> 01:03:18,112
<i>Many are carrying signs and banners...</i>

362
01:03:18,274 --> 01:03:19,627
I could drive.

363
01:03:19,794 --> 01:03:22,149
- <i>no official announcements</i>
<i>over the past few hours...</i>

364
01:03:22,314 --> 01:03:24,782
<i>...but unconfirmed reports</i>
<i>from inside tell us...</i>

365
01:03:24,954 --> 01:03:26,672
<i>...the Man of Steel lies in a coma...</i>

366
01:03:26,834 --> 01:03:31,191
<i>...his condition unchanged</i>
<i>since he was admitted late yesterday.</i>

367
01:03:36,154 --> 01:03:39,271
- <i>Doctors have been vigilant in their...</i>
- <i>Foreign exchange markets...</i>

368
01:03:39,714 --> 01:03:42,626
- Where are you going?
- To the hospital.

369
01:03:42,794 --> 01:03:45,547
I'd be careful down there, guys.
It's a madhouse.

370
01:03:54,874 --> 01:03:57,866
- So much for parking.
- Do you think I can get in?

371
01:03:58,594 --> 01:04:01,347
You're Lois Lane. They'll let you in.

372
01:04:02,274 --> 01:04:04,993
I wanna go with Mommy.

373
01:04:25,314 --> 01:04:26,906
Taxi.

374
01:04:27,074 --> 01:04:28,473
I'll be right here.

375
01:04:35,474 --> 01:04:37,510
Watch your head, okay? Here we go.

376
01:05:08,274 --> 01:05:10,151
This way, Miss Lane.

377
01:05:31,434 --> 01:05:34,312
Mommy? Is he gonna get better?

378
01:05:36,274 --> 01:05:38,788
- I don't know.
- I want him to.

379
01:05:40,194 --> 01:05:42,310
I like him.

380
01:05:44,914 --> 01:05:46,506
Me too.

381
01:06:16,394 --> 01:06:19,067
I don't know if you can hear me.

382
01:06:21,594 --> 01:06:24,950
They say sometimes
that when people are...

383
01:06:27,834 --> 01:06:30,473
That sometimes they can hear you.

384
01:06:36,514 --> 01:06:38,664
I don't know if you can hear me.

385
01:06:47,274 --> 01:06:49,742
I wanted to tell you...

386
01:07:42,794 --> 01:07:44,625
Come on, honey.

387
01:08:26,554 --> 01:08:28,545
Step back, please!

388
01:08:45,034 --> 01:08:48,629
Lex, we only have six of those!

389
01:08:50,434 --> 01:08:51,662
Six?

390
01:08:55,314 --> 01:08:59,466
I would trade 300,000 coconuts...

391
01:08:59,634 --> 01:09:01,864
...and every ounce of your blood...

392
01:09:02,034 --> 01:09:06,471
...for a quart of gasoline!

393
01:09:07,194 --> 01:09:09,754
But what will we have to eat?

394
01:11:39,514 --> 01:11:41,470
You will be different.

395
01:11:44,994 --> 01:11:47,827
Sometimes, you will feel like an outcast.

396
01:11:48,954 --> 01:11:51,548
But you'll never be alone.

397
01:11:53,834 --> 01:11:56,394
You will make my strength your own.

398
01:11:59,234 --> 01:12:02,783
You will see my life through your eyes...

399
01:12:03,634 --> 01:12:08,788
...as your life will be seen through mine.

400
01:12:19,914 --> 01:12:23,793
The son becomes the father...

401
01:12:25,434 --> 01:12:29,985
...and the father becomes the son.

402
01:13:19,594 --> 01:13:21,346
Good night!

403
01:13:30,794 --> 01:13:32,147
I...

404
01:13:40,634 --> 01:13:42,511
Will we see you?

405
01:13:44,474 --> 01:13:46,066
Around?

406
01:13:48,474 --> 01:13:50,544
I'm always around.

407
01:13:55,394 --> 01:13:57,032
Good night, Lois.

408
01:22:39,074 --> 01:22:41,065
