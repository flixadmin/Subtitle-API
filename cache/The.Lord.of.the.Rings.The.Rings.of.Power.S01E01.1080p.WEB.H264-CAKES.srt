1
00:00:22,708 --> 00:00:24,708
<i>Nothing is evil
in the beginning.</i>

2
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:25,791
Here! Over here!

3
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:33,875
<i>And there was a time
when the world was so young,</i>

4
00:00:33,916 --> 00:00:36,916
<i>there had not yet been a sunrise.</i>

5
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:41,375
<i>But even then there was light.</i>

6
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:05,875
Well, is it finished yet?

7
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:21,375
Even you couldn't possibly believe
that old scrap will float.

8
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,333
It's not going to float.

9
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:28,666
It's going to sail.

10
00:01:48,666 --> 00:01:49,786
Stop!

11
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:51,333
No, don't!

12
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:54,041
Stop, you'll break it!

13
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:56,083
Stop! Don't!

14
00:01:56,166 --> 00:01:58,500
- Come on.
- Stop, you're breaking it! Stop!

15
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:04,000
I told you it wouldn't float.

16
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:09,166
Get off me!

17
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:11,541
Lose your footing again, Galadriel?

18
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,833
It was a good ship, sister.

19
00:02:21,916 --> 00:02:23,833
I made it just as you taught me.

20
00:02:25,166 --> 00:02:30,291
Do you know why a ship floats
and a stone cannot?

21
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:35,333
Because the stone sees only downward.

22
00:02:36,458 --> 00:02:40,250
The darkness of the water is vast
and irresistible.

23
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,750
The ship feels the darkness as well,

24
00:02:43,833 --> 00:02:47,666
striving moment by moment
to master her and pull her under.

25
00:02:49,458 --> 00:02:51,750
But the ship has a secret.

26
00:02:53,375 --> 00:02:57,291
For unlike the stone,
her gaze is not downward but up.

27
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,875
Fixed upon the light that guides her,

28
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,833
whispering of grander things
than darkness ever knew.

29
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:10,500
But sometimes the lights shine
just as brightly

30
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:13,250
reflected in the water
as they do in the sky.

31
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:16,541
It's hard to say which way is up
and which way is down.

32
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,875
How am I to know which lights to follow?

33
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:34,875
But that seems so simple.

34
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,166
The most important truths often are.

35
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,458
But you must learn
to discern them for yourself.

36
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:43,375
I won't always be here
to speak them to you.

37
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:44,875
You won't?

38
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,750
Come along. Mother and Father are waiting.

39
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,458
<i>We had no word for death.</i>

40
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:05,541
<i>For we thought our joys would be unending.</i>

41
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:23,833
<i>We thought our light would never dim.</i>

42
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:31,791
<i>So when the Great Foe, Morgoth,</i>

43
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,916
<i>destroyed the very light of our home...</i>

44
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,791
<i>We resisted.</i>

45
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:47,250
<i>And a legion of Elves went to war.</i>

46
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,958
<i>We left Valinor, our home,
and journeyed to a distant realm.</i>

47
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:05,250
<i>One filled with untold perils
and strange creatures beyond count.</i>

48
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:09,375
<i>A place known as Middle-earth.</i>

49
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,875
<i>Valaron kalanen!</i>

50
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:40,333
<i>Firuvantë!</i>

51
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,500
<i>They said it would be over quickly,</i>

52
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:52,458
<i>but the war left Middle-earth in ruin.</i>

53
00:05:55,666 --> 00:05:59,250
<i>And would last centuries.</i>

54
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:23,666
<i>Now, we learned many words for death.</i>

55
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:31,875
<i>In the end, Morgoth would be defeated.</i>

56
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,625
<i>But not before much sorrow.</i>

57
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:42,750
<i>For his Orcs had spread
to every corner of Middle-earth,</i>

58
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:46,583
<i>Multiplying ever greater</i>

59
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:50,166
<i>under the command
of his most devoted servant,</i>

60
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,083
<i>a cruel and cunning sorcerer.</i>

61
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:57,000
<i>They called him Sauron.</i>

62
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:02,291
<i>My brother vowed to seek him out
and destroy him.</i>

63
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,208
<i>But Sauron found him first</i>

64
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,625
<i>and marked his flesh with a symbol.</i>

65
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:17,875
<i>One whose meaning even our wisest
could not discern.</i>

66
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:25,208
<i>And there, in the darkness,</i>

67
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:29,041
<i>his vow became mine.</i>

68
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:33,625
<i>And so, we hunted.</i>

69
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:38,750
<i>To the ends of the Earth we hunted Sauron.</i>

70
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,833
<i>But the trail grew thin.</i>

71
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,208
<i>Year gave way to year.</i>

72
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,166
<i>Century gave way to century.</i>

73
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:55,375
<i>And for many Elves, the pain of those days</i>

74
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:58,458
<i>passed out of thought and mind.</i>

75
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,000
<i>More and more of our kind</i>

76
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:05,583
<i>began to believe that Sauron
was but a memory.</i>

77
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:10,750
<i>And the threat, at last, was ended.</i>

78
00:08:13,583 --> 00:08:15,916
<i>I wish I could be one of them.</i>

79
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:14,833
Commander Galadriel.

80
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:20,000
This company has followed you
to the very edge of the world.

81
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:22,875
But none who ever dared search
for this last stronghold

82
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:24,375
has ever found anything.

83
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:28,916
It's been years
since the last Orc was sighted.

84
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:34,250
Is it not possible the other commanders
are right and our enemy is no more?

85
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,541
Night is closing in.

86
00:09:36,291 --> 00:09:40,291
How long can living flesh endure
where even sunlight fears to tread?

87
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:47,250
Perhaps we would be wise to camp here.

88
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:50,250
And tomorrow, begin the journey home.

89
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,166
We are losing the light.

90
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,291
Commander, wait!

91
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:14,875
No. We keep moving.

92
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,791
Galadriel, stop!

93
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,416
There's nothing out here.
We should have been there by now.

94
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:51,875
We are there.

95
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,750
This is it.

96
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:18,041
This is where the Orcs gathered
after Morgoth's defeat.

97
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:22,041
Far more must have escaped,
than we ever imagined.

98
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,416
My hand is past feeling.

99
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:28,541
No.

100
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:33,500
This place is so evil,
our torches give off no warmth.

101
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,416
This way.

102
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,500
How can you be certain?

103
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:39,666
It's colder than the rest.

104
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:10,875
A door was filled in here.

105
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,083
Bring it down.

106
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,625
What devilry is this?

107
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,916
These Orcs were meddling
with the powers of the Unseen World.

108
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:59,583
Some dark sorcery of old.

109
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,458
But what was their purpose?

110
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:09,250
Surely, it is lost to the ages now.

111
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,500
Whatever happened here was long ago.

112
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,208
Water.

113
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,291
Even stone cannot hide the mark

114
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,958
of one whose very hand
is flame unquenched.

115
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:43,791
He was here.

116
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,666
Sauron was here.

117
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,458
Tell the others to rest while they can.

118
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:52,750
At sunrise we move on.
We'll take the search further north.

119
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:53,916
Further north?

120
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,916
This mark was left as a trail
for Orcs to follow.

121
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:00,333
The last time I saw it was on my brother.

122
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,041
We must follow it.

123
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,583
The mark is centuries old.

124
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,500
Whoever left it could be long dead.

125
00:14:06,583 --> 00:14:08,458
Or lying in wait, gathering strength,

126
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:10,875
perfecting whatever dark art
eluded him here.

127
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:12,958
We exceeded our orders months ago.

128
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:17,083
Surely we must first return home
to take counsel with the High King.

129
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:20,666
I promise you there is not a soul
amongst our company

130
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:23,708
who yearns for home more than I.

131
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,791
I can still feel the light of the Trees
on my face.

132
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,208
I can still see it.

133
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,375
And until we are certain

134
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:40,458
every trace of our enemy is vanquished...

135
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,458
I can never return.

136
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,375
Snow-troll!

137
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,381
We should never
have come in here.

138
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:38,833
We leave soon enough.

139
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,833
The order is given.

140
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,458
We march at first light.

141
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,500
Then you shall do so alone.

142
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,875
Something's wrong here.
Nothing to hunt.

143
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,791
Wolves in every thicket.

144
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,541
Don't you think
it's the least bit strange?

145
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,375
World's strange.

146
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,416
If I let 'em pitch-kettle me,

147
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,791
I'd never get off me barstool.

148
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,676
Oi, oi!

149
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,833
Keep walkin'.

150
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:16,000
Why?

151
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,333
Looked like a badger. Maybe a fox.

152
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:21,750
More likely a Harfoot.

153
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,083
A Harfoot?

154
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,000
Ugh. Don't care to be seein' none,

155
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:28,125
but if you do, watch yourself.

156
00:18:28,208 --> 00:18:30,541
Dangerous creatures they are.

157
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:32,958
You're making it up.

158
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,375
Come on. Rattle your dags!

159
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:41,250
Let's just get to the lake before sundown.

160
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:00,541
Huh? Huh.

161
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,208
Clear and clear.

162
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,250
Nori!

163
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:29,375
Nori!

164
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,666
Nori!

165
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:38,333
Nori!

166
00:19:57,791 --> 00:20:00,416
Travelers? At this time of year?

167
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,791
It's an omen, I warrant ya.

168
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:05,458
- Mmm-hmm. Bad one. As bad as they come.
- Easy, Malva.

169
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:08,791
The last time we had travelers this early,
it was the Great Frost.

170
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:12,250
And there's no misremembering
how bleak a season that was.

171
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,333
More than likely they just got lost,
that's it.

172
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:15,892
Has to be the reason.

173
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,276
You're gonna spoil dinner.

174
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,208
I've looked high and low again.

175
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,958
The wee ones are still out there.

176
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,583
They'll be fine, Goldie.

177
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:26,375
Nori's with them. You know Nori.

178
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,291
Yes. I do.

179
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:32,291
Can we turn back now?

180
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,875
There's 110 things out here
that could kill us.

181
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:38,250
Hundred-eleven
if you count you worrying to death.

182
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,892
You know the rules.
We're not supposed to be out this far.

183
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:43,541
Don't be... If we didn't do everything
we weren't supposed to,

184
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:45,250
we'd hardly do anything at all.

185
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:46,375
Me first!

186
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,750
Go on, now. Watch the puddle.

187
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:53,375
Watch your head.

188
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,291
This way!

189
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:57,750
Nori!

190
00:20:58,625 --> 00:20:59,916
- I'm stuck.
- I've got you.

191
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:01,541
It's...

192
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,041
Nori! Ow!

193
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:09,000
Enchanting.

194
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,125
Come on.

195
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,958
Can we turn back now?

196
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:17,750
- Oh, but you haven't even seen it yet.
- Seen what?

197
00:21:17,833 --> 00:21:20,208
Good place for a hill-troll to hide,
if you ask me.

198
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:23,541
Oh, great glory and splendor.

199
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,041
Oh!

200
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,000
Nori!

201
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:38,541
Mmm.

202
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:43,916
Mmm.

203
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,166
Nori!

204
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:58,541
I found something.

205
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,708
There's something in the mud.

206
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:03,750
What is it?

207
00:22:05,833 --> 00:22:07,250
It looks like a footsie.

208
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,541
A dog.

209
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:14,166
Just a dog.
You know how dogs love berries.

210
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:23,000
Is he going to eat our berries?

211
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:25,166
Not if he doesn't see us, he isn't.

212
00:22:25,916 --> 00:22:29,250
Hey. Twos and hands, everyone. Time to go.

213
00:22:29,333 --> 00:22:31,791
- What's the big rush?
- Wolf.

214
00:22:34,125 --> 00:22:35,875
You heard your sister. Time to go.

215
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:37,791
Go on, now. Come on.

216
00:22:37,875 --> 00:22:40,750
First one back to camp
gets the first pie at Harvest Fest.

217
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:41,833
Let's go.

218
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:47,333
Remember, if anybody asks,
we were just out digging for snails.

219
00:22:57,125 --> 00:23:01,083
<i>"I Palannúmen...
I Alfirimë Nóri...</i>

220
00:23:01,166 --> 00:23:02,916
<i>"Na metta avantë...</i>

221
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:05,083
"Home.

222
00:23:07,625 --> 00:23:11,458
"For centuries, they have swept
across crag and crevice,

223
00:23:11,541 --> 00:23:14,166
"washing away the last remnants
of our enemy.

224
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:17,416
"Like a spring rain over the bones of a...

225
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:19,458
"Dead animal."

226
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:24,916
"Spring rain over the bones of a..."

227
00:23:26,708 --> 00:23:28,041
Herald Elrond.

228
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,666
At last.

229
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:35,666
Yes. It's almost as if I didn't wish
to be found.

230
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,250
What tidings?

231
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,083
The Council regrets to inform you

232
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:41,750
you won't be permitted
to attend the next session.

233
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,375
Elf-lords only.

234
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:49,791
Is there anything else?

235
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:52,000
Yes. Your friend has arrived.

236
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:55,333
She's here? Why didn't you say so?

237
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,458
For the ceremony.

238
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,666
Galadriel.

239
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:25,666
Elrond.

240
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:29,041
Lindon receives you with grace.

241
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:30,791
With grace, I am received.

242
00:24:36,291 --> 00:24:40,208
I hear it's said that
when you cross over, you hear a song.

243
00:24:40,291 --> 00:24:42,416
One whose memory we all carry.

244
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:45,083
And you are immersed in a light,

245
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:48,875
more intoxicating than any sensation
in all of Middle-earth.

246
00:24:48,958 --> 00:24:53,208
When I was a child,
it was the only feeling I knew.

247
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:55,000
And look at you now.

248
00:24:55,083 --> 00:24:58,083
Commander of the Northern Armies.
Warrior of the Wastelands.

249
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:03,041
I half expected you to arrive
caked in grime and mud.

250
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:06,166
This time, frostbite and troll blood.

251
00:25:07,166 --> 00:25:08,250
And no army.

252
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:10,791
Tell me everything.

253
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:14,791
This mark's very existence
proves Sauron escaped.

254
00:25:14,875 --> 00:25:16,125
He's still out there.

255
00:25:16,541 --> 00:25:18,166
The question now is, where?

256
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:22,125
I intend to ask of the King
a fresh company.

257
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:25,208
- If he supplies enough to...
- You have only just arrived.

258
00:25:25,291 --> 00:25:27,500
Must you speak of leaving again so soon?

259
00:25:27,583 --> 00:25:29,416
You know very well why I must.

260
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:33,666
There will be ample time later
to discuss official matters.

261
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:36,291
I want to hear about you.

262
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:39,291
Your harrowing journey.

263
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,083
Why, Elrond.

264
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:43,291
You really have become a politician.

265
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,125
You make it sound so grim.

266
00:25:45,208 --> 00:25:48,541
I am not some courtier
to be placated by idle flattery.

267
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:52,291
I demand to speak with the King directly.

268
00:25:54,708 --> 00:25:56,416
You have made that plain.

269
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,708
So I will be equally plain.

270
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:05,583
It was not your company
who defied you out there,

271
00:26:06,083 --> 00:26:08,416
but rather you who defied the High King,

272
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:12,041
by refusing to heed
any limit placed upon you.

273
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,333
In an act of magnanimity,

274
00:26:15,416 --> 00:26:18,125
he has chosen
to honor your accomplishments...

275
00:26:18,958 --> 00:26:21,291
Rather than dwell upon your insolence.

276
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,416
Test him again

277
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,916
and you may find him less receptive
than you might have hoped.

278
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:38,458
Are you going
to arrange an audience or not?

279
00:26:40,583 --> 00:26:43,541
If after the ceremony
that is still your wish,

280
00:26:43,625 --> 00:26:45,041
you shall have it.

281
00:26:56,875 --> 00:26:58,833
Ah. She has returned.

282
00:26:58,916 --> 00:27:01,500
- How fare thee?
- Well and well, Father.

283
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:03,041
And look at her!

284
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:05,166
You found all that
down by the river bank, did you?

285
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,250
Mm-hmm.

286
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,916
Did you hear about the travelers?

287
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,416
- Travelers?
- Mm-hmm. Hunters.

288
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,333
Two of them.

289
00:27:13,416 --> 00:27:15,500
Big as great boulders.

290
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:17,041
Right up on that ridge.

291
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:18,625
I can't believe I missed them.

292
00:27:18,708 --> 00:27:22,375
Maybe you ought to stick closer to home,
that way you don't miss anything, hmm?

293
00:27:31,208 --> 00:27:33,416
You went to the old farm again.

294
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:35,291
Didn't you?

295
00:27:36,416 --> 00:27:37,416
I was careful.

296
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,416
But the children might not be.

297
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,083
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

298
00:27:41,166 --> 00:27:43,333
We never get hunters up here
before the harvest.

299
00:27:43,416 --> 00:27:45,625
- Mmm.
- Or wolves.

300
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,041
I wonder if there's trouble down south.

301
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:53,583
And what concern is that of yours,
Elanor Brandyfoot?

302
00:27:58,666 --> 00:28:00,375
Haven't you ever wondered...

303
00:28:01,416 --> 00:28:02,916
What else is out there?

304
00:28:03,541 --> 00:28:04,875
How far the river flows

305
00:28:04,958 --> 00:28:08,583
or where the sparrows
learn the new songs they sing in spring?

306
00:28:09,166 --> 00:28:13,333
I can't help but feel
there's wonders in this world.

307
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:15,500
Beyond our wanderin'.

308
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:18,000
I've told you.

309
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,583
Countless times.

310
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,916
Elves have forests to protect.

311
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,250
Dwarves, their mines.
Men, their fields of grain.

312
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:32,833
Even trees have to worry
about the soil beneath their roots.

313
00:28:33,458 --> 00:28:37,291
But we Harfoots are free
from the worries of the wide world.

314
00:28:37,375 --> 00:28:41,125
We are but ripples in a long, long stream.

315
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:43,958
Our paths set by the passing seasons.

316
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:47,708
Nobody goes off trail
and nobody walks alone.

317
00:28:49,708 --> 00:28:52,416
We have each other. We're safe.

318
00:28:53,875 --> 00:28:55,375
That is how we survive.

319
00:28:58,041 --> 00:29:00,875
Go on. Help your father.

320
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:07,000
That's your problem.
You see, a wheel's supposed to be round.

321
00:29:40,708 --> 00:29:44,666
These most valiant of warriors

322
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:49,291
kneel here before us, victorious.

323
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:53,708
For though Morgoth fell an Age ago,

324
00:29:54,416 --> 00:29:58,208
some feared a new evil might arise
from his shadow.

325
00:29:58,291 --> 00:30:00,125
So for centuries now,

326
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:04,291
these soldiers have swept
across crag and crevice,

327
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:07,625
washing away the last remnants
of our enemy

328
00:30:07,708 --> 00:30:11,416
like a spring rain over the bones
of a spoilt carcass.

329
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:15,458
And now, at last,

330
00:30:16,666 --> 00:30:20,041
they return to us in triumph,

331
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:23,250
for they have proven beyond any doubt

332
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:27,458
that our days of war are over.

333
00:30:29,791 --> 00:30:30,875
Today...

334
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:35,541
Our days of peace begin.

335
00:31:01,541 --> 00:31:04,958
And as a measure of our gratitude,

336
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:08,583
these heroes shall be granted an honor

337
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:11,416
unrivaled in all our lore.

338
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,791
They will be escorted to the Grey Havens

339
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:19,208
and granted passage across the sea
to dwell for all eternity

340
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:24,000
in the Blessed Realm, the Far West.

341
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:27,250
The Undying Lands of Valinor.

342
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:31,916
At last, they are going home.

343
00:32:34,041 --> 00:32:37,375
Are you just going to stand there,
breathing like an Orc?

344
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:44,000
It is said the wine of victory is sweetest

345
00:32:44,083 --> 00:32:46,666
for those in whose bitter trials
it has fermented.

346
00:32:47,416 --> 00:32:49,250
I do not feel victorious.

347
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:52,375
You deserve the honors of this day.

348
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:54,916
Your brother would be proud.

349
00:33:01,208 --> 00:33:03,958
I remember when the first of these
were carved.

350
00:33:05,291 --> 00:33:08,708
The likeness of one fallen,
preserved upon a living thing.

351
00:33:08,791 --> 00:33:12,541
I suppose some part of me
always believed my rest would be here,

352
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:13,916
with them.

353
00:33:14,958 --> 00:33:16,875
But instead, I am to leave them.

354
00:33:18,458 --> 00:33:22,458
This is the gift of your king.

355
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
A gift I have decided to refuse.

356
00:33:29,125 --> 00:33:30,125
Galadriel, you...

357
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:32,916
My brother gave his life hunting Sauron.

358
00:33:34,416 --> 00:33:36,416
His task is now mine.

359
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:42,458
I go to seek the enemy
that escaped us in the north.

360
00:33:44,083 --> 00:33:46,125
Alone, if I must.

361
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:51,291
Ah, yes. Your mystery sigil.

362
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:53,208
I shared it with the High King.

363
00:33:53,291 --> 00:33:55,083
- Then why would...
- Because seeing a sigil

364
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:57,708
does not mean you're any closer
to finding Sauron.

365
00:33:57,791 --> 00:34:01,166
It is over. The evil is gone.

366
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:03,625
Then why is it not gone from in here?

367
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:07,041
After all you have endured...

368
00:34:08,416 --> 00:34:10,666
It is only natural to feel conflicted.

369
00:34:11,666 --> 00:34:13,125
Conflicted?

370
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:19,666
I am grateful you have not known evil
as I have.

371
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:23,125
But you have not seen what I have seen.

372
00:34:23,208 --> 00:34:24,250
I've seen my share.

373
00:34:24,333 --> 00:34:27,958
You have not seen what I have seen.

374
00:34:28,791 --> 00:34:30,916
Evil does not sleep, Elrond.

375
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,458
It waits.

376
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:36,958
And in the moment of our complacency,

377
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:38,458
it blinds us.

378
00:34:40,416 --> 00:34:43,041
Let us say that all is as you fear,

379
00:34:43,125 --> 00:34:46,458
and this enemy is out there somewhere,
lying in wait.

380
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,291
Do you truly believe seeking him out
will satisfy you?

381
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:54,041
That one more Orc upon the point
of your blade will bring you peace?

382
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,041
- If you are wrong...
- I'm not wrong.

383
00:34:56,125 --> 00:34:57,583
If you are wrong,

384
00:34:58,458 --> 00:35:01,625
will you lead more Elves
to die in far-off lands?

385
00:35:03,458 --> 00:35:05,583
To convince yourself you have done enough,

386
00:35:05,666 --> 00:35:08,500
how many more statues
would you add to this path?

387
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:11,958
No one in history
has ever refused the call.

388
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:14,875
Do so now, it may never come again.

389
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:18,750
You will linger here, an outcast,

390
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:21,083
poisoned in dark whispers and dreams.

391
00:35:21,166 --> 00:35:23,625
And in the West,
do you think my fate would be better?

392
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:28,916
Where song would mock the cries
of battle in my ears?

393
00:35:30,916 --> 00:35:34,833
You say I have won victory
over all the horrors of Middle-earth.

394
00:35:36,375 --> 00:35:38,583
Yet you would leave them alive in me?

395
00:35:39,666 --> 00:35:41,000
To take with me?

396
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,916
Undying, unchanging, unbreaking,

397
00:35:46,958 --> 00:35:49,333
into the land of winterless spring?

398
00:35:49,416 --> 00:35:51,833
Only in the Blessed Realm

399
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:54,416
can that which is broken in you be healed.

400
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,333
Go there.

401
00:35:56,833 --> 00:35:58,625
Go, and I promise you...

402
00:35:59,333 --> 00:36:03,250
If but a whisper of a rumor
of the threat you perceive proves true,

403
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:06,125
I will not rest until it is put right.

404
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,416
You have fought long enough, Galadriel.

405
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,541
Put up your sword.

406
00:36:15,291 --> 00:36:17,208
Without it, what am I to be?

407
00:36:17,291 --> 00:36:18,916
What you have always been.

408
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:23,125
My friend.

409
00:37:20,291 --> 00:37:21,708
Evenin'.

410
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:23,333
<i>Caraes</i> in three moves.

411
00:37:24,791 --> 00:37:25,833
Hmm.

412
00:37:26,916 --> 00:37:27,916
Ha!

413
00:37:28,166 --> 00:37:29,625
Poisoned more likely.

414
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:31,625
Poisoned? By who?

415
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:35,250
For all we know,
the onion-eyed scut done it himself.

416
00:37:47,375 --> 00:37:49,250
Arondir.

417
00:37:49,916 --> 00:37:52,250
Has it really been a fortnight already?

418
00:37:53,458 --> 00:37:54,583
It has.

419
00:37:56,416 --> 00:38:00,083
Uh, very little to report this go-round,
I'm afraid.

420
00:38:00,166 --> 00:38:03,583
A couple of shabby disputes,
a bit of uneven dice-handling.

421
00:38:04,166 --> 00:38:06,291
And... Oh, yes!

422
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:08,833
Had a bit of a thrill in here,
Trewsday last.

423
00:38:08,916 --> 00:38:10,833
Bit of a row over a girl.

424
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:14,666
His eye was lazy, hers overactive,
if you take my meaning.

425
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:19,000
Do you care for a drink, soldier?

426
00:38:19,083 --> 00:38:21,291
Well, my well is yours, as ever.

427
00:38:21,375 --> 00:38:22,875
And the poisoning?

428
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:24,416
What poisoning?

429
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,291
The one you were just discussing.

430
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:27,500
No, no, no, no...

431
00:38:27,583 --> 00:38:30,625
It was but poisoned grass
he was twattlin' about.

432
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:34,958
A fellow passed through,
said his grazing's gone rotten.

433
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:37,208
That only weeds will grow.

434
00:38:37,291 --> 00:38:40,000
This fellow, where was he from?

435
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:42,000
Didn't say. East, I think.

436
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:44,166
On what day was he here?

437
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:47,291
Oh, let it go, knife-ears.

438
00:38:48,208 --> 00:38:50,250
It's a bloody patch of grass.

439
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:55,625
The lot you lump us in with
died off a thousand years ago.

440
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:58,541
When are you people gonna let the past go?

441
00:39:02,416 --> 00:39:05,958
The past is with us all,
whether we like it or not.

442
00:39:06,833 --> 00:39:10,833
One day, our true king will return.

443
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:16,458
And pry us right out
from under your pointy boots.

444
00:39:16,541 --> 00:39:18,750
Easy, lad. Quench the fire now.

445
00:39:31,083 --> 00:39:32,083
Come on, lad.

446
00:39:35,208 --> 00:39:37,208
Will there be anythin' else then?

447
00:40:00,791 --> 00:40:02,208
Give me your hand.

448
00:40:16,916 --> 00:40:17,916
Hmm.

449
00:40:20,833 --> 00:40:22,000
<i>Alfirin</i> seeds.

450
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,666
I've not seen this flower
since I was a child.

451
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,916
Where did you find these?

452
00:40:30,583 --> 00:40:34,041
I had to trade with another healer
who was passing through.

453
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:36,250
We crush the petals to form a salve.

454
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:37,958
You crush them?

455
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:39,500
Gently.

456
00:40:42,958 --> 00:40:44,958
Are there healers among your kind?

457
00:40:45,041 --> 00:40:46,416
There are.

458
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,333
But we call them artificers.

459
00:40:49,291 --> 00:40:53,333
Most wounds to our bodies heal
of their own accord,

460
00:40:53,416 --> 00:40:57,833
so, it is their labor instead to render
hidden truths as works of beauty.

461
00:40:58,791 --> 00:41:01,458
For beauty has great power
to heal the soul.

462
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:06,458
Then I hope
you find <i>alfirin</i> flowers beautiful.

463
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:15,416
Until next time, then.

464
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,583
Soldier.

465
00:41:27,291 --> 00:41:28,916
Anything to report?

466
00:41:30,208 --> 00:41:31,875
Nothing out of the ordinary.

467
00:41:34,458 --> 00:41:35,666
And the well...

468
00:41:37,083 --> 00:41:38,333
How was it?

469
00:41:39,875 --> 00:41:41,291
Did you draw some water?

470
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,958
We are awaited at Ostirith.

471
00:41:46,083 --> 00:41:48,916
Have you considered
the consequences I might face

472
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,916
if the Watchwarden were to discover
what it is that you're doing?

473
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,666
Afraid I don't take your meaning.

474
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,309
It's difficult enough
keeping watch over them

475
00:41:55,333 --> 00:41:57,416
without having to keep
one eye squarely on you.

476
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,750
Or do you think me blind?

477
00:41:58,833 --> 00:42:02,000
No. I think you talk too much.

478
00:42:02,708 --> 00:42:04,625
And you smell of rotten leaves.

479
00:42:04,708 --> 00:42:06,208
No, I don't.

480
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:07,458
Yes, you do.

481
00:42:15,291 --> 00:42:18,291
My point is this.
Only twice in known history

482
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:21,500
has a pairing between Elves and humans
even been attempted.

483
00:42:21,583 --> 00:42:24,083
And on each occasion, it ended in tragedy.

484
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,250
It ended in death.

485
00:42:25,333 --> 00:42:27,250
You need not remind me.

486
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:30,416
Then why do you persist?

487
00:42:31,208 --> 00:42:32,916
Give me one reason. One.

488
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,833
Arondir! Médhor!

489
00:42:36,291 --> 00:42:39,208
The High King has declared
the days of war are over.

490
00:42:40,666 --> 00:42:43,083
All the far outposts are being disbanded.

491
00:42:44,541 --> 00:42:45,625
We're leaving.

492
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:14,375
- Taking a last look?
- Mm-hmm.

493
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:19,000
Seventy-nine years
I've been stationed here.

494
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:23,791
I suppose I've grown accustomed to it.

495
00:43:25,458 --> 00:43:29,000
Can you believe this place
was once a barren scrap of rock?

496
00:43:29,083 --> 00:43:31,083
It has changed much, Watchwarden.

497
00:43:31,958 --> 00:43:34,041
But the Men who live here have not.

498
00:43:34,541 --> 00:43:38,541
The blood of those who stood with Morgoth
still darkens their veins.

499
00:43:40,958 --> 00:43:42,833
That was long ago, Watchwarden.

500
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:49,541
What were you before the war?

501
00:43:50,458 --> 00:43:51,583
A grower.

502
00:43:51,666 --> 00:43:54,250
Then you shall be returning home
to far more than you left.

503
00:43:55,416 --> 00:43:58,208
Honors, title.

504
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,166
Your life will begin anew.

505
00:44:02,166 --> 00:44:04,208
But mark this, Arondir,

506
00:44:04,833 --> 00:44:08,416
that for 79 years, you've kept watch
over the men and women of Tirharad,

507
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:11,416
not because of what their ancestors
once did...

508
00:44:12,875 --> 00:44:14,875
But because of who they still are.

509
00:44:20,416 --> 00:44:21,625
And be grateful.

510
00:44:23,166 --> 00:44:25,333
That you need never see them again.

511
00:45:04,041 --> 00:45:07,166
Careful. That's fire-root powder.
You have to do it slowly.

512
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:09,333
Go any slower, I'll be stuck here all day.

513
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:11,291
You're in a boil this morning.

514
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:14,000
Hardly slept.
Mice were dancing a proper jig

515
00:45:14,083 --> 00:45:16,125
- under the floorboards.
- Again?

516
00:45:16,208 --> 00:45:18,916
Last three nights.
Scratchin' and scrapin'.

517
00:45:22,416 --> 00:45:24,250
What's one of them doing here?

518
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:36,750
I heard you were leaving.

519
00:45:37,791 --> 00:45:38,958
We are.

520
00:45:41,166 --> 00:45:43,166
Where's the rest of your company?

521
00:45:44,458 --> 00:45:48,000
Most likely searching for me
at this very moment.

522
00:45:48,708 --> 00:45:50,375
Then why are you at my home?

523
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:05,583
Say what you wish to say.

524
00:46:05,666 --> 00:46:07,166
I have said it already.

525
00:46:08,041 --> 00:46:11,583
A hundred times over,
in every way but words.

526
00:46:13,583 --> 00:46:14,708
Mother.

527
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:17,916
There's a man here for you.

528
00:46:26,875 --> 00:46:27,958
Mum.

529
00:46:31,291 --> 00:46:33,125
You heal animals, too?

530
00:46:35,166 --> 00:46:37,583
If you could just give her a look.

531
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,541
She's got some sort of a sickness.

532
00:46:42,291 --> 00:46:43,708
What manner of sickness?

533
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:52,541
It isn't a fever.

534
00:46:54,541 --> 00:46:57,166
And she doesn't appear to have any sores.

535
00:46:58,375 --> 00:47:00,000
Where has she been grazing?

536
00:47:00,083 --> 00:47:01,833
Hmm. She wandered east a few days ago.

537
00:47:02,958 --> 00:47:04,541
Think she might have ate something?

538
00:47:09,208 --> 00:47:12,041
What was that, squirted out of her?

539
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:14,916
How far east?

540
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,375
She might've made it
as far as Hordern.

541
00:47:24,625 --> 00:47:25,833
Where are you going?

542
00:47:25,916 --> 00:47:29,166
Hordern's a day's journey.
If I leave now, I can reach it by dusk.

543
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:30,583
I'm going with you.

544
00:47:43,083 --> 00:47:44,833
Be quick about it.

545
00:47:44,916 --> 00:47:47,208
He finds us in here,
he'll knock our teeth out.

546
00:47:50,875 --> 00:47:53,000
Only spotted it by mistake.

547
00:47:53,083 --> 00:47:54,375
Stepped on a lucky board.

548
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:58,083
So, tell me,

549
00:47:59,083 --> 00:48:01,625
is it true? About your mum?

550
00:48:02,583 --> 00:48:04,000
Is what true?

551
00:48:04,708 --> 00:48:08,500
Heard Waldreg caught herself
and one of the pointies

552
00:48:08,625 --> 00:48:11,125
mighty sweet back of his well
the other day.

553
00:48:11,208 --> 00:48:12,333
Who told you that?

554
00:48:12,416 --> 00:48:13,666
Everybody.

555
00:48:14,125 --> 00:48:15,291
It's a lie.

556
00:48:15,833 --> 00:48:18,375
Maybe that's why your father
run off like he done.

557
00:48:18,458 --> 00:48:19,791
My father didn't run off.

558
00:48:19,875 --> 00:48:21,041
Then what happened to him?

559
00:48:21,791 --> 00:48:23,458
You don't even know, do you?

560
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,833
Salty rascal's got the King's bounty
down there.

561
00:48:31,416 --> 00:48:32,916
This is the real bounty.

562
00:48:53,125 --> 00:48:54,125
Watch it!

563
00:48:56,625 --> 00:48:57,708
Go on, quick.

564
00:49:36,541 --> 00:49:38,541
She has passed beyond my sight.

565
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:42,833
Galadriel was so certain
her search should continue.

566
00:49:44,083 --> 00:49:47,083
We foresaw that if it had,

567
00:49:47,166 --> 00:49:52,541
she might have inadvertently kept alive
the very evil she sought to defeat.

568
00:49:54,583 --> 00:49:57,666
For the same wind
that seeks to blow out a fire

569
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:00,166
may also cause its spread.

570
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,750
Then the shadow she sought...

571
00:50:06,583 --> 00:50:08,166
You believe it does exist?

572
00:50:08,791 --> 00:50:11,416
Set your mind at peace about it.

573
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:14,291
What you did was right.

574
00:50:15,041 --> 00:50:18,333
For Galadriel and for Middle-earth.

575
00:50:20,291 --> 00:50:21,750
It's hard to see what is right...

576
00:50:24,208 --> 00:50:26,416
When friendship and duty are mingled.

577
00:50:28,416 --> 00:50:31,083
Such is the burden of those who lead

578
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,208
and those who would seek to.

579
00:50:35,958 --> 00:50:38,250
Galadriel sails to the sunset.

580
00:50:38,333 --> 00:50:43,166
You and I must look to the new sunrise.

581
00:50:45,291 --> 00:50:46,458
To that end,

582
00:50:48,041 --> 00:50:51,625
are you acquainted
with the work of Lord Celebrimbor?

583
00:50:52,666 --> 00:50:54,666
The greatest of Elven-smiths, of course.

584
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,166
I've admired his artistry
since I was a child. Why do you ask?

585
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:04,000
He is about to embark on a new project.
One of singular importance.

586
00:51:05,083 --> 00:51:08,208
And we've decided
that you will be working with him.

587
00:51:11,166 --> 00:51:14,666
But I'll allow you to explain the details,
Lord Celebrimbor.

588
00:51:30,250 --> 00:51:33,291
First the big people, now the stars.

589
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,333
Eyes open when they should be sleeping.

590
00:51:41,291 --> 00:51:42,583
Almost like...

591
00:51:44,208 --> 00:51:46,375
Like they're watching for something.

592
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:47,958
Watching for what?

593
00:51:48,958 --> 00:51:51,833
A tongue-lashing,
if you don't mind your own cartwheels.

594
00:51:51,916 --> 00:51:53,750
What is it? What do you see?

595
00:51:53,833 --> 00:51:56,041
Elanor Brandyfoot,
with your father's nose,

596
00:51:56,125 --> 00:51:57,958
and always poking it into trouble,

597
00:51:58,041 --> 00:52:02,250
you are far too curious and meddlesome
to have been born a Harfoot.

598
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:05,041
Are you quite certain
you're not part squirrel?

599
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:09,208
Sadoc. Sadoc, please.

600
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,208
Tell me.

601
00:52:13,958 --> 00:52:16,541
The skies are strange.

602
00:52:18,916 --> 00:52:20,208
Strange.

603
00:52:20,291 --> 00:52:21,375
Strange how?

604
00:52:21,458 --> 00:52:23,333
Nori! Do you have that grease?

605
00:52:23,416 --> 00:52:24,666
On my way.

606
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:35,958
How familiar are you
with the townsfolk of Hordern?

607
00:52:36,041 --> 00:52:38,875
Very, I should hope. I was born there.

608
00:52:40,875 --> 00:52:42,041
Why?

609
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:45,583
The people of Hordern were known
for having been especially strong

610
00:52:45,666 --> 00:52:47,333
in their loyalty to Morgoth.

611
00:52:48,458 --> 00:52:49,875
What did you just say?

612
00:52:53,916 --> 00:52:55,166
The truth.

613
00:52:56,416 --> 00:52:58,416
You're talking about my friends.

614
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:01,083
Close kin, I know them.
There are good people there.

615
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:07,041
That is why I'm here with you.

616
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:11,125
Instead of the Watchwarden.

617
00:53:12,166 --> 00:53:13,416
Bronwyn.

618
00:53:20,125 --> 00:53:24,041
You're the only kind touch
I've known all my days in this land.

619
00:53:40,583 --> 00:53:41,833
Hordern.

620
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:16,916
<i>Do you know why
a ship floats and a stone cannot?</i>

621
00:56:51,958 --> 00:56:53,125
Galadriel.

622
00:57:09,041 --> 00:57:10,458
Give me your hand.

623
00:57:23,208 --> 00:57:26,208
<i>But sometimes
the lights shine just as brightly</i>

624
00:57:26,291 --> 00:57:28,958
<i>reflected in the water
as they do in the sky.</i>

625
00:57:30,666 --> 00:57:32,458
<i>How am I to know which lights to follow?</i>

626
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:36,750
Sometimes we cannot know

627
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,500
until we have touched the darkness.

628
00:57:52,125 --> 00:57:53,208
Galadriel!
