1
00:01:14,387 --> 00:01:16,020
Are you the guys from Washington?

2
00:01:16,022 --> 00:01:17,922
You get many other visitors out here?

3
00:01:17,924 --> 00:01:19,590
How long you been on-site?

4
00:01:19,592 --> 00:01:21,058
Since this morning.

5
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,688
A Russian oil team called it in
about 18 hours ago.

6
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,397
How come nobody spotted it before?

7
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:28,246
It's really not that surprising.

8
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,801
This landscape's changing all the time.

9
00:01:30,803 --> 00:01:32,736
You got any idea
what this thing is exactly?

10
00:01:32,738 --> 00:01:34,905
I don't know.
It's probably a weather balloon.

11
00:01:34,907 --> 00:01:36,215
I don't think so.

12
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:38,426
You know, we don't have the equipment
for a job like this.

13
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:41,412
How long before
we can start craning it out?

14
00:01:41,414 --> 00:01:43,109
I don't think you quite understand.

15
00:01:43,482 --> 00:01:46,230
You guys are gonna need
one hell of a crane.

16
00:02:32,698 --> 00:02:34,666
Base, we're in.

17
00:02:40,773 --> 00:02:42,070
What is this?

18
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,516
Careful.

19
00:03:19,412 --> 00:03:20,709
Lieutenant!

20
00:03:23,878 --> 00:03:25,175
What is it?

21
00:03:25,484 --> 00:03:26,781
My God.

22
00:03:27,086 --> 00:03:29,691
Base, get me a line to the Colonel.

23
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:31,727
It's 3:00 a.m., sir.

24
00:03:31,747 --> 00:03:36,309
I don't care what time it is.
This one's waited long enough.

25
00:04:48,334 --> 00:04:49,451
Open it!

26
00:04:51,237 --> 00:04:52,795
Quickly, before he...

27
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:08,650
It has taken me a long time
to find this place.

28
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:13,185
You should be commended.

29
00:05:13,196 --> 00:05:14,248
Help him up.

30
00:05:18,531 --> 00:05:21,932
I think that you are a man of great vision.

31
00:05:22,234 --> 00:05:24,568
And, in this way, we are much alike.

32
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,103
I am nothing like you.

33
00:05:26,105 --> 00:05:27,629
No, of course, but...

34
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:33,205
...what others see as superstition,
you and I know to be a science.

35
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,667
What you seek is just a legend.

36
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,213
Then why make such an effort
to conceal it?

37
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:03,472
The Tesseract was
the jewel of Odin's treasure room.

38
00:06:08,624 --> 00:06:11,252
It is not something one buries.

39
00:06:11,917 --> 00:06:16,073
But I think it is close, yes?

40
00:06:16,755 --> 00:06:18,355
I cannot help you.

41
00:06:18,357 --> 00:06:22,744
No. But maybe you can help your village.

42
00:06:23,162 --> 00:06:28,122
You must have some friends out there.
Some little grandchildren, perhaps?

43
00:06:28,868 --> 00:06:31,234
I have no need for them to die.

44
00:06:44,984 --> 00:06:46,975
Yggdrasil.

45
00:06:47,786 --> 00:06:50,254
Tree of the world.

46
00:06:52,091 --> 00:06:54,218
Guardian of wisdom.

47
00:06:56,195 --> 00:06:58,163
And fate, also.

48
00:07:29,161 --> 00:07:33,791
And the FÃ¼hrer digs for trinkets
in the desert.

49
00:07:37,236 --> 00:07:40,205
You have never seen this, have you?

50
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,268
It's not for the eyes of ordinary men.

51
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,977
Exactly.

52
00:07:49,348 --> 00:07:51,559
Give the order to open fire.

53
00:07:52,518 --> 00:07:53,645
Fool!

54
00:07:54,486 --> 00:07:56,887
You cannot control the power you hold.

55
00:07:56,889 --> 00:07:57,913
You will burn!

56
00:07:59,024 --> 00:08:00,753
I already have.

57
00:08:13,205 --> 00:08:15,173
O'Connell, Michael.

58
00:08:16,008 --> 00:08:18,033
Kaminsky, Henry.

59
00:08:18,377 --> 00:08:20,676
Boy, a lot of guys
getting killed over there.

60
00:08:20,679 --> 00:08:22,306
Rogers, Steven.

61
00:08:23,382 --> 00:08:26,180
It kind of makes you think twice
about enlisting, huh?

62
00:08:26,719 --> 00:08:27,845
Nope.

63
00:08:30,823 --> 00:08:32,290
Rogers.

64
00:08:38,564 --> 00:08:41,124
- What did your father die of?
- Mustard gas.

65
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:45,185
He was in the 107th Infantry.
I was hoping I could be assigned-

66
00:08:45,197 --> 00:08:47,893
- Your mother?
- She was a nurse in a TB ward.

67
00:08:48,173 --> 00:08:50,266
Got hit. Couldn't shake it.

68
00:08:54,747 --> 00:08:56,880
- Sorry, son.
- Look, just give me a chance.

69
00:08:56,882 --> 00:08:59,442
You'd be ineligible on your asthma alone.

70
00:08:59,918 --> 00:09:01,153
Is there anything you can do?

71
00:09:01,453 --> 00:09:02,750
I'm doing it.

72
00:09:03,188 --> 00:09:04,450
I'm saving your life.

73
00:09:08,494 --> 00:09:10,962
War continues to ravage Europe.

74
00:09:11,997 --> 00:09:13,965
But help is on the way.

75
00:09:14,733 --> 00:09:19,363
Every able-bodied young man
is lining up to serve his country.

76
00:09:22,274 --> 00:09:27,078
Even little Timmy is doing his part
collecting scrap metal.

77
00:09:27,312 --> 00:09:28,389
Nice work, Timmy!

78
00:09:28,414 --> 00:09:29,676
Who cares?

79
00:09:30,849 --> 00:09:32,549
Play the movie already!

80
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:34,515
Hey, you wanna show some respect?

81
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:38,312
Meanwhile, overseas,
our brave boys are showing the Axis powers

82
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,824
that the price of freedom
is never too high.

83
00:09:40,826 --> 00:09:43,124
Let's go! Get on with it!

84
00:09:44,086 --> 00:09:45,815
Hey, just start the cartoon!

85
00:09:45,817 --> 00:09:47,163
Hey, you wanna shut up?

86
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:50,755
Together with Allied forces,
we'll face any threat,

87
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,101
no matter the size.

88
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:11,414
You just don't know when to give up,
do you?

89
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,787
I can do this all day.

90
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,448
Hey!

91
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,917
Pick on someone your own size.

92
00:10:29,241 --> 00:10:32,007
Sometimes I think you like getting punched.

93
00:10:32,911 --> 00:10:34,538
I had him on the ropes.

94
00:10:35,555 --> 00:10:36,920
How many times is this?

95
00:10:38,187 --> 00:10:40,314
You're from Paramus now?

96
00:10:40,491 --> 00:10:43,225
You know it's illegal to lie
on the enlistment form.

97
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:44,694
And seriously, Jersey?

98
00:10:46,558 --> 00:10:47,957
You get your orders?

99
00:10:50,562 --> 00:10:51,710
The 107th.

100
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:55,898
Sergeant James Barnes, shipping out
for England first thing tomorrow.

101
00:10:59,304 --> 00:11:00,896
I should be going.

102
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,593
Come on, man.

103
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,269
My last night! I got to get you cleaned up.

104
00:11:09,281 --> 00:11:10,924
Why? Where are we going?

105
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:12,246
The future.

106
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:19,160
I don't see what the problem is.

107
00:11:19,164 --> 00:11:22,124
You're about to be
the last eligible man in New York.

108
00:11:22,127 --> 00:11:24,459
You know there's
three and a half million women here?

109
00:11:24,461 --> 00:11:25,922
Well, I'd settle for just one.

110
00:11:26,798 --> 00:11:28,335
Good thing I took care of that.

111
00:11:28,867 --> 00:11:29,925
Hey, Bucky!

112
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,282
What'd you tell her about me?

113
00:11:34,573 --> 00:11:36,404
Only the good stuff.

114
00:11:37,609 --> 00:11:43,322
Welcome to the Modern Marvels Pavilion
and the World of Tomorrow.

115
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:47,716
A greater world. A better world.

116
00:11:50,989 --> 00:11:53,549
Oh, my God! It's starting!

117
00:11:55,827 --> 00:11:58,387
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Howard Stark!

118
00:12:08,273 --> 00:12:10,639
I love you, Howard!

119
00:12:12,945 --> 00:12:15,111
Ladies and gentlemen,

120
00:12:15,113 --> 00:12:18,605
what if I told you that
in just a few short years,

121
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:22,919
your automobile won't even
have to touch the ground at all?

122
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:27,161
Yes. Thanks, Mandy.

123
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:31,726
With Stark Gravitic Reversion Technology,
you'll be able to do just that.

124
00:12:40,072 --> 00:12:41,334
Holy cow.

125
00:12:53,752 --> 00:12:55,811
I did say a few years, didn't I?

126
00:13:04,429 --> 00:13:07,728
Hey, Steve, what do you say
we treat these girls...

127
00:13:16,541 --> 00:13:18,338
Come on, soldier.

128
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,514
Come on. You're kind of
missing the point of a double date.

129
00:13:25,517 --> 00:13:27,060
We're taking the girls dancing.

130
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:29,082
You go ahead. I'll catch up with you.

131
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:34,095
You're really going to do this again?

132
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:35,769
Well, it's a fair. I'm gonna try my luck.

133
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:37,551
As who, Steve from Ohio?

134
00:13:37,568 --> 00:13:39,900
They'll catch you.
Or worse, they'll actually take you.

135
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,032
Look, I know you don't think I can do this.

136
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,738
This isn't a back alley, Steve. It's war.

137
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,583
- I know it's a war.
- Why are you so keen to fight?

138
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:47,495
- There are so many important jobs.
- What do you want me to do?

139
00:13:47,506 --> 00:13:49,500
Collect scrap metal
in my little red wagon?

140
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:51,245
- Yes. Why not?
- I'm not gonna sit in a factory, Bucky.

141
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,750
Bucky, come on.
There are men laying down their lives.

142
00:13:54,836 --> 00:13:57,047
I got no right to do any less than them.

143
00:13:57,049 --> 00:13:59,898
That's what you don't understand.
This isn't about me.

144
00:14:00,152 --> 00:14:03,246
Right. 'Cause you got nothing to prove.

145
00:14:06,158 --> 00:14:08,991
Hey, Sarge! Are we going dancing?

146
00:14:10,262 --> 00:14:11,698
Yes, we are.

147
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:20,445
Don't do anything stupid until I get back.

148
00:14:20,447 --> 00:14:21,471
How can I?

149
00:14:21,673 --> 00:14:23,538
You're taking all the stupid with you.

150
00:14:26,244 --> 00:14:28,872
- You're a punk.
- Jerk.

151
00:14:29,648 --> 00:14:31,343
Be careful.

152
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,362
Don't win the war till I get there!

153
00:14:41,393 --> 00:14:44,294
Come on, girls. They're playing our song.

154
00:15:03,849 --> 00:15:05,077
Wait here.

155
00:15:06,118 --> 00:15:08,518
- Is there a problem?
- Just wait here.

156
00:15:27,472 --> 00:15:28,769
Thank you.

157
00:15:32,611 --> 00:15:37,860
So, you want to go overseas.
Kill some Nazis.

158
00:15:39,217 --> 00:15:40,514
Excuse me?

159
00:15:40,901 --> 00:15:45,283
Dr. Abraham Erskine. I represent
the Strategic Scientific Reserve.

160
00:15:45,624 --> 00:15:46,716
Steve Rogers.

161
00:15:51,229 --> 00:15:52,787
Where are you from?

162
00:15:53,231 --> 00:15:57,361
Queens. 73rd Street and Utopia Parkway.

163
00:15:57,836 --> 00:15:59,422
Before that, Germany.

164
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:02,704
- This troubles you?
- No.

165
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:07,873
Where are you from, Mr. Rogers?
Is it New Haven?

166
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,379
Or Paramus?

167
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,680
Five exams in five different cities.

168
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:14,851
That might not be the right file.

169
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,814
No, it's not the exams I'm interested in.

170
00:16:16,822 --> 00:16:18,758
It's the five tries.

171
00:16:20,025 --> 00:16:24,155
But you didn't answer my question.
Do you want to kill Nazis?

172
00:16:27,412 --> 00:16:28,453
Is this a test?

173
00:16:29,534 --> 00:16:30,602
Yes.

174
00:16:33,939 --> 00:16:35,566
I don't want to kill anyone.

175
00:16:36,341 --> 00:16:39,435
I don't like bullies.
I don't care where they're from.

176
00:16:41,204 --> 00:16:44,711
Well, there are already
so many big men fighting this war.

177
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:46,590
Maybe what we need now is a little guy.

178
00:16:48,954 --> 00:16:50,387
I can offer you a chance.

179
00:16:51,751 --> 00:16:53,118
Only a chance.

180
00:16:53,758 --> 00:16:55,487
- I'll take it.
- Good.

181
00:16:56,728 --> 00:17:00,528
So where is the little guy from? Actually?

182
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,816
Brooklyn.

183
00:17:05,036 --> 00:17:07,504
Congratulations, soldier.

184
00:17:31,663 --> 00:17:33,790
Are you ready, Dr. Zola?

185
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:38,896
My machine requires
the most delicate calibration.

186
00:17:40,505 --> 00:17:42,496
Forgive me if I seem overcautious.

187
00:17:43,085 --> 00:17:45,308
Are you certain that
those conductors of yours

188
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:49,612
can withstand the energy surge
long enough for transference?

189
00:17:49,614 --> 00:17:51,095
With this artifact,

190
00:17:51,716 --> 00:17:53,047
I am certain of nothing.

191
00:17:53,351 --> 00:17:55,717
I fear it may not work at all.

192
00:18:32,857 --> 00:18:34,051
Twenty percent.

193
00:18:36,294 --> 00:18:37,625
Forty.

194
00:18:40,324 --> 00:18:41,655
Sixty.

195
00:18:44,536 --> 00:18:46,367
Stabilizing at 70%.

196
00:18:48,557 --> 00:18:52,186
I have not come all this way
for safety, Doctor.

197
00:19:10,762 --> 00:19:12,320
What was that?

198
00:19:12,931 --> 00:19:18,942
I must congratulate you, Arnim.
Your designs do not disappoint.

199
00:19:19,404 --> 00:19:23,704
Though they may require
some slight reinforcement.

200
00:19:24,476 --> 00:19:26,706
The exchange is stable.

201
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:28,634
Amazing!

202
00:19:29,414 --> 00:19:34,484
The energy we have just collected
could power my designs. All my designs.

203
00:19:36,655 --> 00:19:39,453
This will change the war.

204
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:42,005
Dr. Zola,

205
00:19:43,328 --> 00:19:46,263
this will change the world.

206
00:19:48,782 --> 00:19:50,647
Ready, exercise!

207
00:19:50,649 --> 00:19:52,536
Recruits, attention!

208
00:19:53,538 --> 00:19:55,161
Gentlemen, I am Agent Carter.

209
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,122
I supervise all operations
for this division.

210
00:19:58,443 --> 00:20:00,274
What's with the accent, Queen Victoria?

211
00:20:01,479 --> 00:20:03,646
I thought I was signing up
for the U.S. Army.

212
00:20:03,648 --> 00:20:04,888
What's your name, soldier?

213
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,916
Gilmore Hodge, Your Majesty.

214
00:20:06,918 --> 00:20:08,613
Step forward, Hodge.

215
00:20:10,388 --> 00:20:11,794
Put your right foot forward.

216
00:20:13,191 --> 00:20:14,522
We gonna wrassle?

217
00:20:16,361 --> 00:20:18,727
'Cause I got a few moves
I know you'll like.

218
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:22,861
Agent Carter!

219
00:20:23,234 --> 00:20:24,599
Colonel Phillips.

220
00:20:24,601 --> 00:20:27,895
I can see that you are breaking
in the candidates. That's good!

221
00:20:28,417 --> 00:20:29,772
Get your ass up out of that dirt

222
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,608
and stand in that line at attention till
somebody comes tells you what to do.

223
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,043
Yes, sir!

224
00:20:37,382 --> 00:20:40,249
General Patton has said

225
00:20:40,251 --> 00:20:43,986
that wars are fought with weapons,
but they are won by men.

226
00:20:43,988 --> 00:20:47,515
We are going to win this war
because we have the best men.

227
00:20:51,924 --> 00:20:54,085
And because they are going to get better.

228
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,055
Much better.

229
00:20:57,006 --> 00:21:00,719
The Strategic Scientific Reserve
is an Allied effort

230
00:21:00,721 --> 00:21:03,739
made up of the best minds
in the free world.

231
00:21:04,375 --> 00:21:07,469
Our goal is to create 
the best army in history.

232
00:21:08,046 --> 00:21:10,336
But every army starts with one man.

233
00:21:10,348 --> 00:21:12,145
Rogers! Get off of there!

234
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:14,575
At the end of this week,
we will choose that man.

235
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:18,548
He will be the first
in a new breed of super-soldier.

236
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:27,312
Rogers! Get that rifle out of the mud!

237
00:21:27,314 --> 00:21:32,268
And they will personally escort
Adolf Hitler to the gates of hell.

238
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:34,397
Pick up the pace, ladies!

239
00:21:35,073 --> 00:21:38,531
Let's go, let's go! Double time!

240
00:21:38,877 --> 00:21:41,675
Come on! Faster! Faster!

241
00:21:42,147 --> 00:21:44,445
Move! Move!

242
00:21:44,816 --> 00:21:46,784
Squad, halt!

243
00:21:47,452 --> 00:21:49,682
That flag means
we're only at the halfway point.

244
00:21:50,421 --> 00:21:53,916
First man to bring it to me
gets a ride back with Agent Carter.

245
00:21:53,925 --> 00:21:55,620
Move, move!

246
00:21:56,594 --> 00:21:58,391
Come on! Get up there!

247
00:21:58,663 --> 00:22:01,464
If that's all you got,
this army's in trouble!

248
00:22:01,466 --> 00:22:03,024
Get up there, Hodge!

249
00:22:03,334 --> 00:22:05,666
Come on! Get up there!

250
00:22:07,338 --> 00:22:09,772
Nobody's got that flag in 17 years!

251
00:22:11,609 --> 00:22:14,844
Now fall back into line! Come on, fall in!

252
00:22:14,846 --> 00:22:17,110
Let's go! Get back into formation!

253
00:22:19,651 --> 00:22:21,992
Rogers! I said fall in!

254
00:22:38,136 --> 00:22:39,660
Thank you, sir.

255
00:22:48,479 --> 00:22:50,674
Faster, ladies! Come on.

256
00:22:50,982 --> 00:22:53,280
My grandmother has more life in her,
God rest her soul.

257
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:55,868
Move it!

258
00:22:55,876 --> 00:22:58,087
You're not really thinking
about picking Rogers, are you?

259
00:22:58,089 --> 00:23:01,090
I'm more than just thinking about it.
He is the clear choice.

260
00:23:01,092 --> 00:23:04,391
When you brought a 90-pound
asthmatic onto my army base,

261
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,719
I let it slide. I thought, "What the hell."
Maybe he'd be useful to you, like a gerbil.

262
00:23:07,721 --> 00:23:08,912
I never thought you'd pick him.

263
00:23:08,933 --> 00:23:10,093
Up.

264
00:23:12,604 --> 00:23:15,037
You stick a needle in that kid's arm,
it's gonna go right through him.

265
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,168
Come on, girls.

266
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:17,683
Look at that.

267
00:23:18,476 --> 00:23:19,841
He's making me cry.

268
00:23:19,843 --> 00:23:22,612
I am looking for qualities
beyond the physical.

269
00:23:22,614 --> 00:23:25,237
Do you know how long it took
to set up this project?

270
00:23:25,239 --> 00:23:27,659
All the groveling I had to do in front of
Senator What's-His-Name's committees?

271
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:30,077
Brandt. Yes, I know.
I am well aware of your efforts.

272
00:23:30,088 --> 00:23:33,422
Then throw me a bone.
Hodge passed every test we gave him.

273
00:23:33,424 --> 00:23:35,324
He's big, he's fast. He obeys orders.

274
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:36,926
- He's a soldier.
- He is a bully.

275
00:23:37,128 --> 00:23:39,858
You don't win wars with niceness, Doctor.

276
00:23:43,201 --> 00:23:45,999
You win wars with guts.

277
00:23:48,139 --> 00:23:49,299
Grenade!

278
00:23:53,845 --> 00:23:55,142
Get away!

279
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,045
Get back!

280
00:24:04,355 --> 00:24:05,879
It was a dummy grenade.

281
00:24:06,991 --> 00:24:08,982
All clear. Back in formation.

282
00:24:13,298 --> 00:24:14,356
Is this a test?

283
00:24:16,134 --> 00:24:17,260
He's still skinny.

284
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:27,471
- May I?
- Yeah.

285
00:24:30,815 --> 00:24:32,112
Can't sleep?

286
00:24:32,784 --> 00:24:34,581
I got the jitters, I guess.

287
00:24:35,153 --> 00:24:36,450
Me, too.

288
00:24:38,256 --> 00:24:39,866
Can I ask you a question?

289
00:24:39,891 --> 00:24:41,256
Just one?

290
00:24:43,494 --> 00:24:44,893
Why me?

291
00:24:47,932 --> 00:24:50,730
I suppose that is the only question 
that matters.

292
00:24:53,938 --> 00:24:56,907
This is from Augsburg. My city.

293
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:03,213
So many people forget that the first
country the Nazis invaded was their own.

294
00:25:03,948 --> 00:25:07,439
You know, after the last war,
my people struggled.

295
00:25:07,452 --> 00:25:10,439
They felt weak. They felt small.

296
00:25:10,455 --> 00:25:15,282
And then Hitler comes along with the
marching and the big show and the flags.

297
00:25:16,627 --> 00:25:20,730
And he hears of me. My work.
And he finds me.

298
00:25:20,732 --> 00:25:22,029
And he says, "You."

299
00:25:22,967 --> 00:25:24,730
He says, "You will make us strong."

300
00:25:25,503 --> 00:25:28,131
Well, I am not interested.

301
00:25:29,574 --> 00:25:31,906
So he sends the head of Hydra,

302
00:25:32,377 --> 00:25:34,345
his research division.

303
00:25:34,645 --> 00:25:37,546
A brilliant scientist by the name
of Johann Schmidt.

304
00:25:37,548 --> 00:25:41,381
Now, Schmidt is a member 
of the inner circle. And he is ambitious.

305
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:47,086
He and Hitler share a passion for
occult power and Teutonic myth.

306
00:25:47,882 --> 00:25:50,874
Hitler uses his fantasies
to inspire his followers.

307
00:25:50,876 --> 00:25:52,820
But for Schmidt, it is not fantasy.

308
00:25:53,231 --> 00:25:55,117
For him, it is real.

309
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:58,976
He has become convinced that
there is a great power hidden in the earth,

310
00:25:58,976 --> 00:26:03,108
left here by the gods,
waiting to be seized by a superior man.

311
00:26:03,674 --> 00:26:08,702
So when he hears about my formula
and what it can do, he cannot resist.

312
00:26:11,749 --> 00:26:14,309
Schmidt must become that superior man.

313
00:26:20,024 --> 00:26:21,341
Did it make him stronger?

314
00:26:21,359 --> 00:26:22,587
Yes.

315
00:26:23,027 --> 00:26:25,936
But there were other effects.

316
00:26:30,401 --> 00:26:31,527
The serum was not ready.

317
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:35,739
But more important, the man.

318
00:26:36,743 --> 00:26:39,075
The serum amplifies everything
that is inside,

319
00:26:39,077 --> 00:26:44,008
so good becomes great.
Bad becomes worse.

320
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,912
This is why you were chosen.

321
00:26:52,075 --> 00:26:55,687
Because a strong man
who has known power all his life

322
00:26:55,689 --> 00:26:57,699
may lose respect for that power,

323
00:26:57,701 --> 00:27:00,831
but a weak man knows the value of strength.

324
00:27:01,399 --> 00:27:03,264
And knows...

325
00:27:03,801 --> 00:27:05,098
...compassion.

326
00:27:08,306 --> 00:27:11,036
Thanks. I think.

327
00:27:16,981 --> 00:27:19,882
Whatever happens tomorrow,
you must promise me one thing.

328
00:27:23,087 --> 00:27:25,180
That you will stay who you are.

329
00:27:27,725 --> 00:27:30,950
Not a perfect soldier, but...

330
00:27:31,562 --> 00:27:33,530
...a good man.

331
00:27:38,736 --> 00:27:40,203
To the little guys.

332
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:44,371
No, no. Wait, wait. What I am doing?

333
00:27:44,373 --> 00:27:46,591
No, you have procedure tomorrow.
No fluids.

334
00:27:47,778 --> 00:27:49,903
All right. We'll drink it after.

335
00:27:49,914 --> 00:27:53,281
No, I don't have procedure tomorrow.
Drink it after? I drink it now.

336
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:11,666
Is there something in particular you need?

337
00:28:17,542 --> 00:28:20,340
I understand you found him.

338
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:22,806
See for yourself.

339
00:28:34,959 --> 00:28:36,449
You disapprove.

340
00:28:37,161 --> 00:28:40,292
I just don't see 
why you need concern yourself.

341
00:28:40,298 --> 00:28:42,112
I can't imagine he will succeed.

342
00:28:45,069 --> 00:28:46,263
Again.

343
00:28:46,694 --> 00:28:50,687
His serum is the Allies' only defense
against this power we now possess.

344
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:54,370
If we take it away from them,
then our victory is assured.

345
00:28:57,582 --> 00:28:59,209
Shall I give the order?

346
00:29:00,318 --> 00:29:02,218
It has been given.

347
00:29:04,422 --> 00:29:05,719
Good.

348
00:29:08,704 --> 00:29:09,671
Dr. Zola!

349
00:29:13,664 --> 00:29:14,961
What do you think?

350
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:23,739
A masterpiece.

351
00:29:34,085 --> 00:29:35,746
I know this neighborhood.

352
00:29:36,454 --> 00:29:38,649
I got beat up in that alley.

353
00:29:40,291 --> 00:29:41,377
And that parking lot.

354
00:29:43,628 --> 00:29:45,528
And behind that diner.

355
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:48,430
Did you have something
against running away?

356
00:29:51,168 --> 00:29:53,702
You start running, 
they'll never let you stop.

357
00:29:53,704 --> 00:29:57,170
You stand up, you push back.
They can't say no forever, right?

358
00:29:57,975 --> 00:30:01,433
I know a little of what that's like,
to have every door shut in your face.

359
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:06,348
I guess I just don't know why you'd want to
join the Army if you were a beautiful dame.

360
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,010
Or a... A woman.

361
00:30:08,019 --> 00:30:09,479
An agent. Not a dame.

362
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,244
You are beautiful, but...

363
00:30:12,056 --> 00:30:14,251
You have no idea
how to talk to a woman, do you?

364
00:30:14,825 --> 00:30:16,793
I think this is the longest conversation
I've had with one.

365
00:30:18,262 --> 00:30:21,789
Women aren't exactly lining up
to dance with a guy they might step on.

366
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,599
You must have danced.

367
00:30:23,601 --> 00:30:26,263
Well, asking a woman to dance
always seemed so terrifying.

368
00:30:27,338 --> 00:30:32,307
And the past few years, it just didn't seem
to matter that much. I figured I'd wait.

369
00:30:32,677 --> 00:30:33,871
For what?

370
00:30:35,513 --> 00:30:36,912
The right partner.

371
00:30:51,462 --> 00:30:52,861
This way.

372
00:30:56,133 --> 00:30:58,499
- What are we doing here?
- Follow me.

373
00:31:11,882 --> 00:31:14,544
Wonderful weather this morning, isn't it?

374
00:31:14,652 --> 00:31:16,882
Yes, but I always carry an umbrella.

375
00:32:14,545 --> 00:32:16,035
Good morning.

376
00:32:17,281 --> 00:32:18,908
Please, not now.

377
00:32:23,754 --> 00:32:24,880
Are you ready?

378
00:32:26,957 --> 00:32:30,518
Good. Take off your shirt, your tie,
and your hat.

379
00:32:36,248 --> 00:32:37,958
Senator Brandt, glad you could make it.

380
00:32:37,968 --> 00:32:39,617
Why exactly am I in Brooklyn?

381
00:32:39,626 --> 00:32:41,574
We needed access to the city's power grid.

382
00:32:41,587 --> 00:32:43,872
Of course, if you'd given me
the generators I requisitioned...

383
00:32:43,874 --> 00:32:46,035
A lot of people
are asking for funds, Colonel.

384
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:47,508
This is...

385
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:49,398
Fred Clemson, State Department.

386
00:32:49,413 --> 00:32:50,956
If this project of yours comes through,

387
00:32:50,971 --> 00:32:53,722
we'd like to see it used
for something other than headlines.

388
00:32:53,724 --> 00:32:57,225
Jesus. Somebody get that kid a sandwich.

389
00:33:10,468 --> 00:33:11,526
Comfortable?

390
00:33:13,637 --> 00:33:14,763
It's a little big.

391
00:33:17,107 --> 00:33:18,665
You save me any of that schnapps?

392
00:33:19,684 --> 00:33:22,551
Not as much as I should have. Sorry.

393
00:33:22,947 --> 00:33:24,244
Next time.

394
00:33:25,316 --> 00:33:27,531
Mr. Stark, how are your levels?

395
00:33:27,551 --> 00:33:29,781
- Levels at 100%.
- Good.

396
00:33:29,806 --> 00:33:32,321
We may dim half the lights in Brooklyn,

397
00:33:32,323 --> 00:33:35,121
but we are ready as we'll ever be.

398
00:33:36,141 --> 00:33:37,165
Agent Carter?

399
00:33:37,175 --> 00:33:39,625
Don't you think you would be
more comfortable in the booth?

400
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,222
- Yes, of course. Sorry.
- Good.

401
00:33:54,086 --> 00:33:55,451
Do you hear me? Is this on?

402
00:33:56,509 --> 00:33:57,750
Ladies and gentlemen,

403
00:33:58,282 --> 00:34:01,852
today we take not another step
towards annihilation,

404
00:34:02,152 --> 00:34:05,746
but the first step on the path to peace.

405
00:34:08,117 --> 00:34:13,632
We begin with a series of microinjections
into the subject's major muscle groups.

406
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:18,197
The serum infusion will cause
immediate cellular change.

407
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:21,837
And then, to stimulate growth,

408
00:34:21,854 --> 00:34:25,360
the subject will be saturated 
with Vita-Rays.

409
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:34,313
That wasn't so bad.

410
00:34:34,852 --> 00:34:36,149
That was penicillin.

411
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:42,240
Serum infusion beginning in

412
00:34:42,249 --> 00:34:43,410
five,

413
00:34:44,461 --> 00:34:45,450
four,

414
00:34:46,897 --> 00:34:47,886
three,

415
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:50,823
two,

416
00:34:52,269 --> 00:34:53,258
one.

417
00:35:03,847 --> 00:35:05,178
Now, Mr. Stark.

418
00:35:28,598 --> 00:35:31,567
Steven? Can you hear me?

419
00:35:32,009 --> 00:35:35,137
It's probably too late
to go to the bathroom, right?

420
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,275
We will proceed.

421
00:35:50,828 --> 00:35:51,990
That's 10%.

422
00:35:52,997 --> 00:35:53,986
Twenty percent.

423
00:35:54,398 --> 00:35:55,524
Thirty.

424
00:35:58,168 --> 00:35:59,226
That's 40%.

425
00:36:00,738 --> 00:36:01,954
Vital signs are normal.

426
00:36:01,972 --> 00:36:03,055
That's 50%.

427
00:36:03,774 --> 00:36:04,763
Sixty.

428
00:36:06,477 --> 00:36:07,739
Seventy.

429
00:36:12,349 --> 00:36:13,338
Steven!

430
00:36:13,984 --> 00:36:15,884
- Steven!
- Shut it down!

431
00:36:17,221 --> 00:36:18,245
Shut it down!

432
00:36:18,956 --> 00:36:20,322
Kill the reactor, Mr. Stark!

433
00:36:20,324 --> 00:36:21,882
Turn it off! Kill it! Kill the reactor!

434
00:36:21,907 --> 00:36:23,204
No!

435
00:36:23,727 --> 00:36:26,287
Don't! I can do this!

436
00:36:33,237 --> 00:36:34,261
Eighty.

437
00:36:34,972 --> 00:36:35,961
Ninety.

438
00:36:37,408 --> 00:36:39,342
That's 100%.

439
00:37:00,964 --> 00:37:02,864
Mr. Stark?

440
00:37:13,744 --> 00:37:15,644
Steven. Steven.

441
00:37:18,415 --> 00:37:19,712
The son of a bitch did it.

442
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,521
- I did it.
- Yeah, yeah.

443
00:37:28,292 --> 00:37:29,468
I think we did it.

444
00:37:29,493 --> 00:37:30,653
You actually did it.

445
00:37:34,631 --> 00:37:36,223
How do you feel?

446
00:37:39,136 --> 00:37:40,660
Taller.

447
00:37:43,674 --> 00:37:45,074
You look taller.

448
00:37:45,275 --> 00:37:47,074
How do you like Brooklyn now, Senator?

449
00:37:47,344 --> 00:37:51,212
I can think of some folks in Berlin
who are about to get very nervous.

450
00:37:53,751 --> 00:37:55,933
Congratulations, Doctor.

451
00:37:55,943 --> 00:37:57,604
Thank you, sir.

452
00:38:08,899 --> 00:38:10,366
Stop him!

453
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:15,392
What are you doing?

454
00:39:15,393 --> 00:39:17,098
Buddy, are you all right?

455
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,727
Hey, this guy's been shot!

456
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,969
I had him!

457
00:39:31,648 --> 00:39:33,275
Sorry!

458
00:39:53,136 --> 00:39:54,501
I'm sorry!

459
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:09,638
No! No! Not my son!

460
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,047
- Stop it!
- Don't hurt him!

461
00:41:14,051 --> 00:41:15,313
Get back!

462
00:41:16,453 --> 00:41:17,818
Let me go!

463
00:41:20,891 --> 00:41:22,256
Let go of my son!

464
00:41:24,962 --> 00:41:26,224
Don't hurt him!

465
00:41:30,634 --> 00:41:32,295
Wait, don't! Don't!

466
00:41:34,071 --> 00:41:35,095
No! Don't!

467
00:41:41,178 --> 00:41:43,146
Go get him! I can swim!

468
00:42:35,465 --> 00:42:37,762
- Who the hell are you?
- The first of many.

469
00:42:38,035 --> 00:42:39,764
Cut off one head,

470
00:42:41,772 --> 00:42:43,637
two more shall take its place.

471
00:42:46,076 --> 00:42:47,941
Hail Hydra.

472
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:09,898
The FÃ¼hrer is not accustomed to
being ignored, Herr Schmidt.

473
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,901
He funds your research because
you promised him weapons.

474
00:43:12,903 --> 00:43:14,900
You serve at his pleasure.

475
00:43:14,905 --> 00:43:17,872
He gave you this facility
as a reward for your injuries.

476
00:43:17,874 --> 00:43:20,508
Reward? Call it what it is. Exile.

477
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:23,244
I no longer reflect
his image of Aryan perfection.

478
00:43:23,246 --> 00:43:25,291
You think this is about appearances?

479
00:43:25,814 --> 00:43:30,217
Your Hydra division has failed to deliver
so much as a rifle in over a year.

480
00:43:30,219 --> 00:43:32,754
And we had learned
through local intelligence

481
00:43:32,756 --> 00:43:35,924
you had mounted a full-scale incursion
into Norway.

482
00:43:35,926 --> 00:43:37,866
The FÃ¼hrer feels... How does he put it?

483
00:43:37,868 --> 00:43:40,947
"The Red Skull has been
indulged long enough!"

484
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:54,677
Gentlemen,

485
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,738
you have come to see
the results of our work.

486
00:44:02,052 --> 00:44:03,349
Let me show you.

487
00:44:05,062 --> 00:44:09,778
Hitler speaks of a 1,000-year Reich,
but he cannot feed his armies for a month.

488
00:44:09,793 --> 00:44:13,228
His troops spill their blood
across every field in Europe,

489
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:17,257
but still he is no closer 
to achieving his goals.

490
00:44:17,734 --> 00:44:20,973
And I suppose you still aim 
to win this war through magic?

491
00:44:21,638 --> 00:44:25,551
Science. But I understand your confusion.

492
00:44:25,909 --> 00:44:28,707
Great power has always
baffled primitive men.

493
00:44:28,979 --> 00:44:33,314
Hydra is assembling an arsenal
to destroy my enemies in one stroke,

494
00:44:33,316 --> 00:44:36,615
wherever they are, regardless of
how many forces they possess,

495
00:44:36,617 --> 00:44:37,926
all in a matter of hours.

496
00:44:38,214 --> 00:44:39,511
Your enemies?

497
00:44:39,513 --> 00:44:44,925
My weapons contain enough destructive power
to decimate every hostile capital on Earth.

498
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:49,057
Quite simply, gentlemen,

499
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,491
I have harnessed the power of the gods.

500
00:44:54,538 --> 00:44:55,703
Thank you, Schmidt.

501
00:44:55,705 --> 00:44:56,672
For what?

502
00:44:57,176 --> 00:45:00,407
For making it clear 
how obviously mad you are.

503
00:45:00,409 --> 00:45:01,932
Berlin is on this map!

504
00:45:02,812 --> 00:45:04,336
So it is.

505
00:45:06,472 --> 00:45:09,066
You will be punished for your insolence!

506
00:45:09,068 --> 00:45:11,677
You will be brought
before the FÃ¼hrer himself!

507
00:45:20,897 --> 00:45:22,865
Schmidt...

508
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:29,794
My apologies, Doctor,

509
00:45:29,796 --> 00:45:34,833
but we both knew Hydra could grow
no further in Hitler's shadow.

510
00:45:36,213 --> 00:45:37,237
Hail Hydra.

511
00:45:38,048 --> 00:45:39,743
Hail Hydra!

512
00:45:44,354 --> 00:45:46,083
Hail Hydra!

513
00:45:57,734 --> 00:45:59,326
Think you got enough?

514
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:05,000
Any hope of reproducing the program
is locked in your genetic code.

515
00:46:05,642 --> 00:46:08,270
But without Dr. Erskine, 
it would take years.

516
00:46:09,613 --> 00:46:11,308
He deserved more than this.

517
00:46:12,716 --> 00:46:16,174
If it could work only once,
he'd be proud it was you.

518
00:46:19,089 --> 00:46:21,990
Colonel Phillips,
my committee is demanding answers.

519
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:23,992
Great. Why don't we start with how

520
00:46:24,017 --> 00:46:27,180
a German spy got a ride to
my secret installation in your car?

521
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:28,849
What have we got here?

522
00:46:28,874 --> 00:46:31,900
Speaking modestly, I'm the best
mechanical engineer in this country.

523
00:46:32,269 --> 00:46:34,931
But I don't know what's inside this thing
or how it works.

524
00:46:35,441 --> 00:46:36,971
We're not even close to this technology.

525
00:46:36,973 --> 00:46:38,600
- Then who is?
- Hydra.

526
00:46:39,242 --> 00:46:40,607
I'm sure you've been reading our briefings.

527
00:46:41,176 --> 00:46:43,264
I'm on a number of committees, Colonel.

528
00:46:43,266 --> 00:46:45,544
Hydra is the Nazi deep-science division.

529
00:46:45,548 --> 00:46:49,182
It's led by Johann Schmidt.
But he has much bigger ambitions.

530
00:46:49,184 --> 00:46:50,462
Hydra is practically a cult.

531
00:46:50,471 --> 00:46:52,267
They worship Schmidt.
They think he's invincible.

532
00:46:52,656 --> 00:46:54,021
So, what are you going to do about it?

533
00:46:54,891 --> 00:46:56,443
I spoke to the President this morning.

534
00:46:56,733 --> 00:46:59,759
- As of today, the SSR is being retasked.
- Colonel?

535
00:46:59,763 --> 00:47:03,164
We are taking the fight to Hydra.
Pack your bags, Agent Carter.

536
00:47:03,166 --> 00:47:04,463
You, too, Stark.

537
00:47:04,825 --> 00:47:06,619
We're flying to London tonight.

538
00:47:06,621 --> 00:47:09,083
Sir? If you're going after Schmidt,
I want in.

539
00:47:09,205 --> 00:47:11,173
You're an experiment.
You're going to Alamogordo.

540
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:12,932
The serum worked.

541
00:47:12,942 --> 00:47:14,935
I asked for an army
and all I got was you.

542
00:47:15,345 --> 00:47:17,939
You are not enough.

543
00:47:22,118 --> 00:47:23,415
With all due respect to the Colonel,

544
00:47:24,087 --> 00:47:25,884
I think we may be missing the point.

545
00:47:26,256 --> 00:47:30,556
I've seen you in action, Steve.
More importantly, the country's seen it.

546
00:47:30,927 --> 00:47:31,894
Paper.

547
00:47:32,893 --> 00:47:34,588
The enlistment lines
have been around the block

548
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:36,495
since your picture hit the newsstands.

549
00:47:37,367 --> 00:47:40,802
You don't take a soldier,
a symbol like that,

550
00:47:40,804 --> 00:47:42,499
and hide him in a lab.

551
00:47:43,113 --> 00:47:47,092
Son, do you want to serve your country

552
00:47:47,094 --> 00:47:50,063
on the most important battlefield
of the war?

553
00:47:51,348 --> 00:47:53,339
Sir, that's all I want.

554
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:57,351
Then, congratulations.
You just got promoted.

555
00:48:00,535 --> 00:48:01,789
I don't know if I can do this.

556
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:06,421
Nothing to it. You sell a few bonds.
Bonds buy bullets. Bullets kill Nazis.

557
00:48:06,830 --> 00:48:08,589
You're an American hero.

558
00:48:08,598 --> 00:48:10,759
It's just not how I pictured getting there.

559
00:48:11,517 --> 00:48:13,563
The Senator has got
a lot of pull up on the Hill.

560
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:16,815
You play ball with us, you'll be leading
your own platoon in no time.

561
00:48:16,817 --> 00:48:18,307
Take the shield.

562
00:48:19,676 --> 00:48:20,734
Go.

563
00:48:22,112 --> 00:48:26,742
âª Who's strong and brave
Here to save the American way? âª

564
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:30,825
Not all of us can storm a beach
or drive a tank.

565
00:48:30,827 --> 00:48:32,616
But there's still a way
all of us can fight.

566
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:37,334
âª Who vows to fight like a man
For what's right, night and day? âª

567
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:39,342
Series E Defense Bonds.

568
00:48:39,344 --> 00:48:43,126
Each one you buy is a bullet in
the barrel of your best guy's gun.

569
00:48:43,151 --> 00:48:46,811
âª Who will campaign door-to-door 
for America? âª

570
00:48:46,836 --> 00:48:50,101
âª Carry the flag shore to shore 
for America? âª

571
00:48:50,126 --> 00:48:53,351
âª From Hoboken to Spokane âª

572
00:48:53,376 --> 00:48:59,372
âª The star-spangled man with a plan âª

573
00:49:01,751 --> 00:49:02,839
Cut.

574
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,619
Guys, don't look at the camera.

575
00:49:04,621 --> 00:49:08,721
âª We can't ignore there's a threat
and a war we must win âª

576
00:49:08,725 --> 00:49:11,523
Each one you buy is a bullet 
in the barrel of your best guy's gun.

577
00:49:11,535 --> 00:49:16,987
âª Who'll hang a noose on
the goose-stepping goons from Berlin? âª

578
00:49:18,568 --> 00:49:22,103
âª Who will redeem
Heed the call for America? âª

579
00:49:22,105 --> 00:49:25,165
âª Who'll rise or fall
Give his all for America? âª

580
00:49:25,716 --> 00:49:28,676
âª Who's here to prove that we can? âª

581
00:49:28,678 --> 00:49:34,742
âª The star-spangled man with a plan âª

582
00:49:35,218 --> 00:49:37,618
We all know 
this is about trying to win the war.

583
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:40,888
We can't do that without bullets
and bandages, tanks and tents.

584
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:44,628
That's where you come in. Every bond
you buy will help protect someone you love.

585
00:49:45,022 --> 00:49:47,402
- Keep our boys armed and ready,
- Turn around! He's right behind you!

586
00:49:47,404 --> 00:49:50,243
and the Germans will think twice
about trying to get the drop on us.

587
00:49:54,137 --> 00:49:59,837
âª Stalwart and steady and true âª

588
00:50:01,311 --> 00:50:04,280
âª Forceful and ready to defend âª

589
00:50:04,414 --> 00:50:08,282
âª the red, white, and blue âª

590
00:50:08,284 --> 00:50:12,286
âª Who'll give the Axis the sack
and is smart as a fox? âª

591
00:50:12,288 --> 00:50:15,650
âª Far as an eagle will soar âª

592
00:50:15,658 --> 00:50:19,384
âª Who's making Adolf
afraid to step out of his box? âª

593
00:50:19,395 --> 00:50:22,478
âª He knows what we're fighting for âª

594
00:50:22,481 --> 00:50:25,967
âª Who waked the giant 
that napped in America? âª

595
00:50:25,969 --> 00:50:29,405
âª We know it's no one but Captain America âª

596
00:50:30,155 --> 00:50:30,953
Hi.

597
00:50:30,970 --> 00:50:33,064
âª Who'll finish what they began? âª

598
00:50:33,075 --> 00:50:36,221
âª Who'll kick the Krauts to Japan? âª

599
00:50:36,222 --> 00:50:46,418
âª The star-spangled man with a plan! âª

600
00:50:54,397 --> 00:50:58,265
How many of you are ready to help me 
sock old Adolf on the jaw?

601
00:51:03,073 --> 00:51:04,199
Okay.

602
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:09,176
I need a volunteer.

603
00:51:09,178 --> 00:51:11,469
I already volunteered!
How do you think I got here?

604
00:51:12,882 --> 00:51:14,907
Bring back the girls!

605
00:51:18,954 --> 00:51:23,615
I think they only know the one song,
but I'll see what I can do.

606
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,460
You do that, sweetheart.

607
00:51:25,962 --> 00:51:28,590
Nice boots, Tinker Bell!

608
00:51:29,631 --> 00:51:32,095
Come on, guys,
we're all on the same team here.

609
00:51:32,097 --> 00:51:33,217
Hey, Captain!

610
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:34,592
Sign this!

611
00:51:45,248 --> 00:51:47,113
Bring back the girls!

612
00:51:51,754 --> 00:51:54,382
Don't worry, pal. They'll warm up to you.
Don't worry.

613
00:52:02,765 --> 00:52:04,130
Hello, Steve.

614
00:52:05,501 --> 00:52:06,627
Hi.

615
00:52:07,711 --> 00:52:10,004
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

616
00:52:10,006 --> 00:52:12,201
Officially, I'm not here at all.

617
00:52:12,675 --> 00:52:14,575
That was quite a performance.

618
00:52:14,978 --> 00:52:16,155
Yeah.

619
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:19,178
I had to improvise a little bit.

620
00:52:19,182 --> 00:52:21,650
The crowds I'm used to are usually more...

621
00:52:23,288 --> 00:52:24,318
...twelve.

622
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,377
I understand you're "America's New Hope".

623
00:52:26,379 --> 00:52:29,169
Bond sales take a 10% bump
in every state I visit.

624
00:52:29,171 --> 00:52:30,671
Is that Senator Brandt I hear?

625
00:52:32,303 --> 00:52:34,362
At least he's got me doing this.

626
00:52:34,364 --> 00:52:36,116
Phillips would have had me
stuck in a lab.

627
00:52:36,114 --> 00:52:41,248
And these are your only two options?
A lab rat or a dancing monkey?

628
00:52:42,038 --> 00:52:44,666
You were meant for more than this,
you know.

629
00:52:50,546 --> 00:52:51,570
What?

630
00:52:52,956 --> 00:52:55,592
You know, for the longest time,
I dreamed about...

631
00:52:56,343 --> 00:53:01,523
...coming overseas and being on
the front lines, serving my country.

632
00:53:02,392 --> 00:53:04,360
I finally got everything I wanted...

633
00:53:07,897 --> 00:53:09,171
...and I'm wearing tights.

634
00:53:17,573 --> 00:53:19,110
They look like they've been through hell.

635
00:53:19,876 --> 00:53:21,070
These men more than most.

636
00:53:24,914 --> 00:53:29,874
Schmidt sent out a force to Azzano.
Two hundred men went up against him,

637
00:53:30,753 --> 00:53:32,880
and less than 50 returned.

638
00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:36,190
Your audience contained
what was left of the 107th.

639
00:53:37,093 --> 00:53:39,160
The rest were killed or captured.

640
00:53:39,162 --> 00:53:40,754
The 107th?

641
00:53:41,368 --> 00:53:42,063
What?

642
00:53:42,376 --> 00:53:43,707
Come on.

643
00:53:44,683 --> 00:53:45,743
Colonel Phillips.

644
00:53:45,749 --> 00:53:49,079
Well, if it isn't the Star-Spangled Man
With A Plan. What's your plan today?

645
00:53:49,101 --> 00:53:50,438
I need the casualty list from Azzano.

646
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:51,816
You don't get to give me orders, son.

647
00:53:51,818 --> 00:53:54,946
I just need one name,
Sergeant James Barnes from the 107th.

648
00:53:55,578 --> 00:53:58,179
You and I are gonna have 
a conversation later that you won't enjoy.

649
00:53:58,181 --> 00:54:00,079
Please tell me if he's alive, sir. B-A-R...

650
00:54:00,073 --> 00:54:01,142
I can spell.

651
00:54:07,323 --> 00:54:11,783
I have signed more of these condolence
letters today than I would care to count.

652
00:54:12,128 --> 00:54:14,187
But the name does sound familiar.

653
00:54:14,797 --> 00:54:15,821
I'm sorry.

654
00:54:20,036 --> 00:54:22,541
What about the others?
Are you planning a rescue mission?

655
00:54:22,805 --> 00:54:24,256
Yes, it's called "winning the war".

656
00:54:25,641 --> 00:54:27,230
But if you know where they are,
why not at least-

657
00:54:27,243 --> 00:54:29,087
They're 30 miles behind the lines

658
00:54:29,089 --> 00:54:31,933
through some of the most
heavily fortified territory in Europe.

659
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,478
We'd lose more men than we'd save.

660
00:54:33,482 --> 00:54:36,144
But I don't expect you to understand that
because you're a chorus girl.

661
00:54:38,488 --> 00:54:40,072
I think I understand just fine.

662
00:54:40,423 --> 00:54:42,389
Well, then understand it somewhere else.

663
00:54:42,391 --> 00:54:46,589
If I read the posters correctly,
you got someplace to be in 30 minutes.

664
00:54:51,467 --> 00:54:54,095
Yes, sir. I do.

665
00:54:58,207 --> 00:55:03,201
If you have something to say, right now
is the perfect time to keep it to yourself.

666
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:08,433
What do you plan to do, walk to Austria?

667
00:55:08,451 --> 00:55:09,816
If that's what it takes.

668
00:55:09,841 --> 00:55:12,340
You heard the Colonel.
Your friend is most likely dead.

669
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:13,240
You don't know that.

670
00:55:13,251 --> 00:55:15,397
Even so, he's devising a strategy. 
If he detects-

671
00:55:15,399 --> 00:55:18,205
By the time he's done that,
it could be too late.

672
00:55:18,485 --> 00:55:19,480
Steve!

673
00:55:25,668 --> 00:55:29,764
You told me you thought I was meant
for more than this. Did you mean that?

674
00:55:31,474 --> 00:55:32,771
Every word.

675
00:55:34,603 --> 00:55:35,808
Then you got to let me go.

676
00:55:39,115 --> 00:55:40,912
I can do more than that.

677
00:55:41,309 --> 00:55:44,278
On stage, girls. Five minutes!

678
00:55:45,811 --> 00:55:47,154
Where's my helmet?

679
00:55:47,156 --> 00:55:48,555
Anyone seen Rogers?

680
00:55:52,495 --> 00:55:54,603
The Hydra camp is in Krausberg,

681
00:55:54,605 --> 00:55:57,856
tucked between these two mountain ranges.
It's a factory of some kind.

682
00:55:57,858 --> 00:56:00,168
We should be able to drop you 
right on the doorstep.

683
00:56:00,169 --> 00:56:01,946
Just get me as close as you can.

684
00:56:01,945 --> 00:56:03,737
You two are gonna be 
in a lot of trouble when you land.

685
00:56:03,739 --> 00:56:04,782
And you won't?

686
00:56:04,807 --> 00:56:07,351
Where I'm going, if anybody yells at me,
I can just shoot them.

687
00:56:07,376 --> 00:56:09,086
They will undoubtedly shoot back.

688
00:56:09,111 --> 00:56:11,178
Well, let's hope it's good for something.

689
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:12,296
Agent Carter?

690
00:56:12,315 --> 00:56:13,691
If we're not in too much of a hurry,

691
00:56:13,716 --> 00:56:17,243
I thought we could stop off in Lucerne
for a late-night fondue.

692
00:56:22,525 --> 00:56:25,593
Stark is the best civilian pilot
I've ever seen.

693
00:56:25,595 --> 00:56:28,063
He's mad enough to brave this airspace.
We're lucky to have him.

694
00:56:29,832 --> 00:56:31,595
So, are you two... Do you...

695
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,225
...fondue?

696
00:56:36,296 --> 00:56:37,592
This is your transponder.

697
00:56:37,594 --> 00:56:41,051
Activate it when you're ready and
the signal will lead us straight to you.

698
00:56:42,178 --> 00:56:43,936
Are you sure this thing works?

699
00:56:44,276 --> 00:56:46,406
It's been tested more than you, pal.

700
00:56:51,554 --> 00:56:54,079
Get back here!
We're taking you all the way in!

701
00:56:55,892 --> 00:56:58,861
As soon as I'm clear, you turn this thing
around and get the hell out of here!

702
00:56:59,128 --> 00:57:01,096
You can't give me orders!

703
00:57:01,397 --> 00:57:04,025
The hell I can't! I'm a Captain!

704
00:57:22,253 --> 00:57:26,787
As you can see, production of the Valkyrie 
is progressing on schedule,

705
00:57:26,789 --> 00:57:29,087
even with components of this size.

706
00:57:29,449 --> 00:57:32,427
Increase the output by 60%

707
00:57:32,428 --> 00:57:36,057
and see to it our other facilities
do the same.

708
00:57:36,599 --> 00:57:41,268
But these prisoners,
I'm not sure they have the strength.

709
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:44,239
Then use up what strength
they have left, Doctor.

710
00:57:44,774 --> 00:57:47,572
There are always more workers.

711
00:57:49,814 --> 00:57:50,940
Not now!

712
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:07,979
You know, Fritz,

713
00:58:08,965 --> 00:58:11,263
one of these days,
I'm gonna have a stick of my own.

714
00:58:44,441 --> 00:58:45,567
Fellas.

715
01:00:47,475 --> 01:00:48,772
Who are you supposed to be?

716
01:00:48,774 --> 01:00:52,073
I'm... Captain America.

717
01:00:53,329 --> 01:00:54,762
I beg your pardon?

718
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,116
What, are we taking everybody?

719
01:01:00,470 --> 01:01:02,136
I'm from Fresno, Ace.

720
01:01:02,138 --> 01:01:04,868
Is there anybody else? I'm looking
for a Sergeant James Barnes.

721
01:01:05,207 --> 01:01:08,314
There's an isolation ward in the factory,
but no one's ever come back from it.

722
01:01:08,316 --> 01:01:09,408
All right.

723
01:01:09,433 --> 01:01:11,589
The tree line is northwest,
80 yards past the gate.

724
01:01:11,588 --> 01:01:13,802
Get out fast and give 'em hell.

725
01:01:13,804 --> 01:01:15,702
I'll meet you guys in the clearing
with anybody else I find.

726
01:01:15,718 --> 01:01:16,741
Wait.

727
01:01:16,969 --> 01:01:18,250
You know what you're doing?

728
01:01:18,262 --> 01:01:21,181
Yeah. I've knocked out Adolf Hitler
over 200 times.

729
01:01:46,215 --> 01:01:47,944
You know how to use that thing?

730
01:01:52,352 --> 01:01:53,319
Okay.

731
01:01:55,295 --> 01:01:56,762
What is happening?

732
01:02:05,034 --> 01:02:07,002
Hey. Not exactly a Buick.

733
01:02:08,504 --> 01:02:10,438
- That one. "ZÃ¼ndung".
- ZÃ¼ndung?

734
01:02:11,356 --> 01:02:12,419
Get this thing going, Dugan!

735
01:02:12,441 --> 01:02:13,851
I didn't know you spoke German.

736
01:02:13,876 --> 01:02:17,154
Three semesters at Howard,
switched to French, girls much cuter.

737
01:02:17,154 --> 01:02:18,403
Didn't ask for the resume.

738
01:02:30,926 --> 01:02:32,291
- On your left!
- Up top!

739
01:02:49,912 --> 01:02:52,210
No, no! What are you doing?

740
01:02:53,315 --> 01:02:56,284
Our forces are outmatched.

741
01:03:20,943 --> 01:03:23,639
Keep moving! Grab those grenades!

742
01:04:03,252 --> 01:04:06,244
Sergeant. Three-two-five-five-seven.

743
01:04:07,356 --> 01:04:08,323
Bucky?

744
01:04:09,458 --> 01:04:10,425
Oh, my God.

745
01:04:15,564 --> 01:04:17,031
- Is that...
- It's me.

746
01:04:17,266 --> 01:04:19,199
- It's Steve.
- Steve?

747
01:04:19,201 --> 01:04:20,634
- Come on.
- Steve.

748
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:26,044
I thought you were dead.

749
01:04:26,875 --> 01:04:28,240
I thought you were smaller.

750
01:04:36,293 --> 01:04:37,351
Come on.

751
01:04:39,655 --> 01:04:42,453
- What happened to you?
- I joined the Army.

752
01:04:48,831 --> 01:04:50,890
- Did it hurt?
- A little.

753
01:04:51,333 --> 01:04:52,833
Is this permanent?

754
01:04:52,835 --> 01:04:53,893
So far.

755
01:05:23,932 --> 01:05:25,559
Captain America!

756
01:05:25,787 --> 01:05:27,414
How exciting!

757
01:05:27,956 --> 01:05:30,925
I am a great fan of your films!

758
01:05:32,627 --> 01:05:36,586
So, Dr. Erskine managed it after all.

759
01:05:36,988 --> 01:05:38,865
Not exactly an improvement,

760
01:05:38,867 --> 01:05:42,166
but still, impressive.

761
01:05:44,973 --> 01:05:46,440
You've got no idea.

762
01:05:49,989 --> 01:05:51,047
Haven't I?

763
01:06:06,294 --> 01:06:09,338
No matter what lies Erskine told you,

764
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:12,761
you see, I was his greatest success!

765
01:06:26,248 --> 01:06:28,156
You don't have one of those, do you?

766
01:06:28,389 --> 01:06:30,687
You are deluded, Captain.

767
01:06:31,459 --> 01:06:34,087
You pretend to be a simple soldier,

768
01:06:34,089 --> 01:06:40,143
but in reality, you are just afraid to
admit that we have left humanity behind.

769
01:06:42,030 --> 01:06:44,726
Unlike you, I embrace it proudly.

770
01:06:46,004 --> 01:06:47,267
Without fear!

771
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:48,566
Then how come you're running?

772
01:07:00,682 --> 01:07:02,707
Come on, let's go. Up.

773
01:07:05,687 --> 01:07:08,019
Sir? Are we going to the roof?

774
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,198
What about me?

775
01:07:13,203 --> 01:07:14,891
Where will I sit?

776
01:07:15,536 --> 01:07:17,231
Not a scratch, Doctor.

777
01:07:17,242 --> 01:07:18,705
Not a scratch.

778
01:07:51,933 --> 01:07:54,094
Let's go. One at a time.

779
01:08:22,820 --> 01:08:25,789
- Gotta be a rope or something!
- Just go! Get out of here!

780
01:08:25,791 --> 01:08:27,156
No! Not without you!

781
01:08:28,169 --> 01:08:29,466
Hell.

782
01:08:50,916 --> 01:08:54,090
Senator Brandt, I regret to report that

783
01:08:54,092 --> 01:08:59,198
Captain Steven G. Rogers went missing
behind enemy lines on the third.

784
01:08:59,223 --> 01:09:01,234
Aerial reconnaissance
has proven unfruitful.

785
01:09:01,236 --> 01:09:05,263
As a result, 
I must declare Captain Rogers...

786
01:09:06,074 --> 01:09:08,201
...killed in action. Period.

787
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:14,146
The last surveillance flight is back.

788
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:18,620
No sign of activity.

789
01:09:19,358 --> 01:09:21,982
- Go get a cup of coffee, Corporal.
- Yes, sir.

790
01:09:24,911 --> 01:09:29,199
I can't touch Stark. He's rich and he's the
Army's number one weapons contractor.

791
01:09:29,224 --> 01:09:30,457
You are neither one.

792
01:09:30,482 --> 01:09:32,909
With respect, sir,
I don't regret my actions.

793
01:09:32,919 --> 01:09:34,678
And I don't think 
Captain Rogers did, either.

794
01:09:34,703 --> 01:09:37,808
What makes you think
I give a damn about your opinions?

795
01:09:37,810 --> 01:09:39,482
I took a chance with you, Agent Carter.

796
01:09:39,507 --> 01:09:43,449
And now America's golden boy
and a lot of other good men are dead

797
01:09:43,474 --> 01:09:44,582
'cause you had a crush.

798
01:09:44,601 --> 01:09:46,866
It wasn't that. I had faith.

799
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:51,677
Well, I hope that's a big comfort to you
when they shut this division down.

800
01:09:54,222 --> 01:09:55,661
What the hell's going on out there?

801
01:10:38,466 --> 01:10:40,229
Look who it is!

802
01:11:07,690 --> 01:11:09,629
Some of these men need medical attention.

803
01:11:09,631 --> 01:11:11,531
- Medic, we got wounded.
- Right over here.

804
01:11:11,984 --> 01:11:14,544
I'd like to surrender myself
for disciplinary action.

805
01:11:15,817 --> 01:11:17,444
That won't be necessary.

806
01:11:21,353 --> 01:11:22,581
Yes, sir.

807
01:11:24,069 --> 01:11:25,536
Faith, huh?

808
01:11:32,153 --> 01:11:33,415
You're late.

809
01:11:37,519 --> 01:11:39,180
Couldn't call my ride.

810
01:11:41,207 --> 01:11:44,624
Hey! Let's hear it for Captain America!

811
01:12:01,648 --> 01:12:05,084
I am honored to present
this medal for valor

812
01:12:05,086 --> 01:12:08,878
to my personal friend, Captain America!

813
01:12:11,443 --> 01:12:13,070
Captain America!

814
01:12:14,562 --> 01:12:16,530
Captain, that's your cue!

815
01:12:20,335 --> 01:12:22,360
I thought he'd be taller.

816
01:12:34,490 --> 01:12:37,550
The fifth one was here in Poland,
right near the Baltic.

817
01:12:37,552 --> 01:12:39,679
And the sixth one was...

818
01:12:40,221 --> 01:12:45,181
...about here, 30, 40 miles west
of the Maginot Line.

819
01:12:46,995 --> 01:12:48,860
I just got a quick look.

820
01:12:49,564 --> 01:12:51,532
Well, nobody's perfect.

821
01:12:54,836 --> 01:12:57,202
These are the weapon factories
we know about.

822
01:12:57,889 --> 01:13:00,656
Sergeant Barnes said that Hydra shipped 
all the parts to another facility

823
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:02,264
that isn't on this map.

824
01:13:02,266 --> 01:13:04,090
Agent Carter, coordinate with MI6.

825
01:13:04,092 --> 01:13:06,754
I want every Allied eyeball
looking for that main Hydra base.

826
01:13:06,757 --> 01:13:07,888
What about us?

827
01:13:07,882 --> 01:13:10,727
We are going to set a fire
under Johann Schmidt's ass.

828
01:13:10,752 --> 01:13:12,720
What do you say, Rogers? It's your map.

829
01:13:12,745 --> 01:13:14,774
You think you can wipe Hydra off it?

830
01:13:14,775 --> 01:13:16,856
Yes, sir. I'll need a team.

831
01:13:16,858 --> 01:13:19,250
We're already putting together
the best men.

832
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:22,058
With all due respect, sir, so am I.

833
01:13:23,441 --> 01:13:24,905
So, let's get this straight.

834
01:13:24,907 --> 01:13:26,898
We barely got out of there alive,
and you want us to go back?

835
01:13:28,741 --> 01:13:29,969
Pretty much.

836
01:13:29,971 --> 01:13:32,269
Sounds rather fun, actually.

837
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:35,165
I'm in.

838
01:13:47,684 --> 01:13:48,981
We're in.

839
01:13:50,006 --> 01:13:53,421
Hell, I'll always fight.
But you got to do one thing for me.

840
01:13:53,423 --> 01:13:54,412
What's that?

841
01:13:56,451 --> 01:13:57,475
Open a tab.

842
01:14:01,302 --> 01:14:02,769
Well, that was easy.

843
01:14:03,137 --> 01:14:05,571
- Another round.
- Where are they putting all this stuff?

844
01:14:09,721 --> 01:14:11,848
See? I told you.

845
01:14:12,413 --> 01:14:14,381
They're all idiots.

846
01:14:15,084 --> 01:14:16,381
How about you?

847
01:14:17,272 --> 01:14:20,419
You ready to follow Captain America
into the jaws of death?

848
01:14:20,421 --> 01:14:21,547
Hell, no.

849
01:14:21,898 --> 01:14:26,358
That little guy from Brooklyn who was
too dumb not to run away from a fight.

850
01:14:27,452 --> 01:14:29,079
I'm following him.

851
01:14:32,632 --> 01:14:34,157
But you're keeping the outfit, right?

852
01:14:36,838 --> 01:14:37,964
You know what?

853
01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:40,266
It's kind of growing on me.

854
01:14:51,753 --> 01:14:53,152
- Captain.
- Agent Carter.

855
01:14:55,989 --> 01:14:56,956
Ma'am.

856
01:14:56,958 --> 01:15:00,026
Howard has some equipment
for you to try. Tomorrow morning?

857
01:15:00,028 --> 01:15:01,325
Sounds good.

858
01:15:06,034 --> 01:15:08,730
I see your top squad is prepping for duty.

859
01:15:09,279 --> 01:15:10,401
You don't like music?

860
01:15:10,403 --> 01:15:11,585
I do, actually.

861
01:15:13,489 --> 01:15:16,947
I might even, when this is all over,
go dancing.

862
01:15:16,949 --> 01:15:18,589
Then what are we waiting for?

863
01:15:19,547 --> 01:15:21,071
The right partner.

864
01:15:22,349 --> 01:15:23,646
0800, Captain.

865
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:27,017
Yes, ma'am. I'll be there.

866
01:15:27,559 --> 01:15:29,083
I'm invisible.

867
01:15:29,527 --> 01:15:32,587
I'm turning into you.
It's like a horrible dream.

868
01:15:33,251 --> 01:15:36,311
Don't take it so hard.
Maybe she's got a friend.

869
01:15:38,047 --> 01:15:40,675
Emission signature is unusual.

870
01:15:41,069 --> 01:15:43,037
Alpha and beta ray neutral.

871
01:15:44,604 --> 01:15:47,004
Though I doubt Rogers picked up on that.

872
01:15:48,872 --> 01:15:50,169
Seems harmless enough.

873
01:15:51,416 --> 01:15:53,281
Hard to see what all the fuss is about.

874
01:16:02,914 --> 01:16:04,211
Write that down.

875
01:16:06,171 --> 01:16:08,728
Excuse me. I'm looking for Mr. Stark.

876
01:16:08,753 --> 01:16:10,812
He's in with Colonel Phillips.

877
01:16:15,657 --> 01:16:18,455
Of course, you're welcome to wait.

878
01:16:25,813 --> 01:16:27,425
I read about what you did.

879
01:16:27,428 --> 01:16:29,055
Oh, the... Yeah.

880
01:16:30,013 --> 01:16:31,537
Well, that's, you know.

881
01:16:33,121 --> 01:16:34,671
Just doing what needed to be done.

882
01:16:34,856 --> 01:16:37,689
Sounded like more than that.
You saved nearly 400 men.

883
01:16:44,032 --> 01:16:46,000
Really, it's not a big deal.

884
01:16:46,901 --> 01:16:49,028
Tell that to their wives.

885
01:16:52,529 --> 01:16:54,202
I don't think they were all married.

886
01:16:54,208 --> 01:16:55,479
You're a hero.

887
01:16:55,991 --> 01:16:58,482
Well, that depends
on the definition, really.

888
01:16:58,484 --> 01:17:01,783
The women of America,
they owe you their thanks.

889
01:17:02,984 --> 01:17:05,919
And seeing as they're not here...

890
01:17:14,705 --> 01:17:15,694
Captain!

891
01:17:15,696 --> 01:17:18,324
We're ready for you,
if you're not otherwise occupied.

892
01:17:19,584 --> 01:17:21,219
Agent Carter, wait.

893
01:17:21,235 --> 01:17:23,535
Looks like finding a partner
wasn't that hard after all.

894
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:25,152
Peggy, that's not what you thought it was.

895
01:17:25,154 --> 01:17:27,748
I don't think anything, Captain,
not one thing.

896
01:17:28,076 --> 01:17:31,705
You always wanted to be a soldier,
and now you are, just like all the rest.

897
01:17:32,087 --> 01:17:33,179
Well, what about you and Stark?

898
01:17:33,181 --> 01:17:35,889
How do I know you two
haven't been fondue-ing?

899
01:17:40,767 --> 01:17:43,065
You still don't know a bloody thing
about women.

900
01:17:44,601 --> 01:17:46,592
Fondue is just cheese and bread,
my friend.

901
01:17:46,594 --> 01:17:49,495
- Really? I didn't think...
- Nor should you, pal.

902
01:17:49,497 --> 01:17:51,574
The moment you think you know
what's going on in a woman's head

903
01:17:51,588 --> 01:17:54,149
is the moment your goose
is well and truly cooked.

904
01:17:54,151 --> 01:17:56,813
Me, I concentrate on work,
which at the moment

905
01:17:56,815 --> 01:17:59,939
is about making sure you and your men
do not get killed.

906
01:17:59,941 --> 01:18:01,636
Carbon polymer.

907
01:18:02,391 --> 01:18:04,757
Should withstand
your average German bayonet.

908
01:18:04,759 --> 01:18:08,217
Although Hydra's not going to
attack you with a pocket knife.

909
01:18:08,647 --> 01:18:11,519
I hear you're kind of attached.

910
01:18:11,530 --> 01:18:12,929
It's handier than you might think.

911
01:18:12,943 --> 01:18:15,128
I took the liberty of coming up
with some options.

912
01:18:16,095 --> 01:18:17,119
This one's fun.

913
01:18:17,757 --> 01:18:20,306
She's been fitted with electrical relays
that allow you to-

914
01:18:20,308 --> 01:18:21,952
- What about this one?
- No, no, that's just a prototype.

915
01:18:21,963 --> 01:18:23,343
What's it made of?

916
01:18:23,775 --> 01:18:24,647
Vibranium.

917
01:18:25,288 --> 01:18:27,827
It's stronger than steel
and a third the weight.

918
01:18:28,553 --> 01:18:31,267
It's completely vibration absorbent.

919
01:18:33,297 --> 01:18:34,940
How come it's not standard issue?

920
01:18:34,942 --> 01:18:36,435
That's the rarest metal on Earth.

921
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:38,203
What you're holding there,
that's all we've got.

922
01:18:38,228 --> 01:18:40,423
You quite finished, Mr. Stark?

923
01:18:40,448 --> 01:18:42,512
I'm sure the Captain
has some unfinished business.

924
01:18:42,514 --> 01:18:44,034
What do you think?

925
01:18:54,162 --> 01:18:56,130
Yes, I think it works.

926
01:19:05,439 --> 01:19:07,566
I had some ideas about the uniform.

927
01:19:07,842 --> 01:19:09,332
Whatever you want, pal.

928
01:21:14,035 --> 01:21:16,367
You are failing!

929
01:21:17,377 --> 01:21:20,910
We are close to an offensive
that will shake the planet,

930
01:21:20,918 --> 01:21:22,591
yet we are continually delayed

931
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:25,467
because you cannot outwit
a simpleton with a shield!

932
01:21:25,469 --> 01:21:27,437
This is hardly my area of expertise.

933
01:21:27,424 --> 01:21:31,464
I merely developed the weapons.
I cannot fire them.

934
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:35,785
Finish your mission, Doctor,
before the American finishes his.

935
01:21:36,682 --> 01:21:37,671
Sir!

936
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:41,074
I'm sorry, Herr Schmidt.

937
01:21:42,627 --> 01:21:44,424
We fought to the last man.

938
01:21:47,568 --> 01:21:49,536
Evidently not.

939
01:22:01,749 --> 01:22:05,050
Remember when I made you ride
the Cyclone at Coney Island?

940
01:22:05,052 --> 01:22:06,679
Yeah, and I threw up?

941
01:22:08,132 --> 01:22:09,555
This isn't payback, is it?

942
01:22:09,557 --> 01:22:11,504
Now why would I do that?

943
01:22:11,506 --> 01:22:14,236
We were right. Dr. Zola's on the train.

944
01:22:14,238 --> 01:22:17,433
Hydra dispatcher gave him permission
to open up the throttle.

945
01:22:17,898 --> 01:22:19,964
Wherever he's going,
they must need him bad.

946
01:22:26,907 --> 01:22:29,273
Let's get going,
because they're moving like the devil.

947
01:22:29,950 --> 01:22:31,727
We only got about a 10-second window.

948
01:22:31,729 --> 01:22:34,482
You miss that window,
we're bugs on a windshield.

949
01:22:34,997 --> 01:22:35,964
Mind the gap.

950
01:22:35,983 --> 01:22:37,848
Better get moving, bugs!

951
01:23:45,686 --> 01:23:47,779
Stop him! Fire again!

952
01:24:40,461 --> 01:24:43,021
- I had him on the ropes.
- I know you did.

953
01:24:43,644 --> 01:24:44,668
Get down!

954
01:24:46,914 --> 01:24:48,245
Fire again!

955
01:24:49,016 --> 01:24:50,540
Kill him! Now!

956
01:24:57,825 --> 01:24:58,792
Bucky!

957
01:25:02,897 --> 01:25:04,330
Hang on!

958
01:25:06,066 --> 01:25:07,230
Grab my hand!

959
01:26:12,633 --> 01:26:13,930
Sit down.

960
01:26:20,407 --> 01:26:22,705
- What is this?
- Steak.

961
01:26:23,714 --> 01:26:24,840
What is in it?

962
01:26:25,913 --> 01:26:27,210
Cow.

963
01:26:30,440 --> 01:26:33,432
Doctor, do you realize how difficult it is

964
01:26:33,434 --> 01:26:36,232
to get ahold of a prime cut like that
out here?

965
01:26:37,767 --> 01:26:39,166
I don't eat meat.

966
01:26:40,077 --> 01:26:41,306
Why not?

967
01:26:41,311 --> 01:26:42,972
It disagrees with me.

968
01:26:42,997 --> 01:26:45,898
How about cyanide? Does that give you
the rumbly tummy, too?

969
01:26:48,859 --> 01:26:52,104
Every Hydra agent that
we've tried to take alive

970
01:26:52,106 --> 01:26:56,907
has crunched a little pill before
we can stop him. But not you.

971
01:26:57,945 --> 01:27:00,743
So, here is my brilliant theory.

972
01:27:03,055 --> 01:27:04,352
You want to live.

973
01:27:05,686 --> 01:27:07,813
You're trying to intimidate me, Colonel.

974
01:27:08,455 --> 01:27:10,047
I bought you dinner.

975
01:27:15,295 --> 01:27:18,442
"Given the valuable information
he has provided

976
01:27:19,133 --> 01:27:22,694
"and in exchange for his full cooperation,

977
01:27:23,137 --> 01:27:26,190
"Dr. Zola is being remanded 
to Switzerland"?

978
01:27:26,192 --> 01:27:30,275
I sent that message to Washington
this morning, of course it was encoded.

979
01:27:30,871 --> 01:27:34,586
You guys haven't broken those codes,
have you? That would be awkward.

980
01:27:34,588 --> 01:27:36,556
Schmidt will know this is a lie.

981
01:27:36,550 --> 01:27:40,111
He's going to kill you anyway, Doc.
You're a liability.

982
01:27:40,554 --> 01:27:42,657
You know more about Schmidt than anyone.

983
01:27:42,881 --> 01:27:48,094
And the last guy you cost us
was Captain Rogers' closest friend,

984
01:27:48,096 --> 01:27:50,462
so I wouldn't count on
the very best of protection.

985
01:27:51,832 --> 01:27:54,460
It's you or Schmidt.

986
01:27:55,069 --> 01:27:57,128
It's just the hand you've been dealt.

987
01:27:59,740 --> 01:28:02,834
Schmidt believes he walks
in the footsteps of the gods.

988
01:28:04,694 --> 01:28:07,577
Only the world itself will satisfy him.

989
01:28:07,579 --> 01:28:09,774
You do realize that's nuts, don't you?

990
01:28:09,783 --> 01:28:10,941
What?

991
01:28:11,875 --> 01:28:14,070
The sanity of the plan is
of no consequence.

992
01:28:14,067 --> 01:28:16,418
- And why is that?
- Because he can do it!

993
01:28:16,924 --> 01:28:18,340
What's his target?

994
01:28:19,526 --> 01:28:21,858
His target...

995
01:28:23,430 --> 01:28:24,488
...is everywhere.

996
01:28:45,319 --> 01:28:46,946
Tomorrow,

997
01:28:47,721 --> 01:28:51,020
Hydra will stand master of the world,

998
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:54,840
borne to victory on the wings
of the Valkyrie.

999
01:28:55,429 --> 01:28:59,331
Our enemies' weapons
will be powerless against us.

1000
01:28:59,967 --> 01:29:04,927
If they shoot down one plane,
hundreds more will rain fire upon them!

1001
01:29:09,552 --> 01:29:15,066
If they cut off one head,
two more shall take its place.

1002
01:29:15,575 --> 01:29:16,872
Hail Hydra.

1003
01:29:17,084 --> 01:29:18,051
- Hail Hydra!
- Hail Hydra!

1004
01:29:18,752 --> 01:29:21,380
- Hail Hydra! Hail Hydra!
- Hail Hydra! Hail Hydra!

1005
01:29:33,367 --> 01:29:36,165
Blackout is still in effect
throughout the London area.

1006
01:29:36,537 --> 01:29:38,505
Please wait for the all-clear.

1007
01:29:38,872 --> 01:29:43,832
Your attention, please. All citizens shall
remain indoors until further notice.

1008
01:29:44,545 --> 01:29:47,605
Blackout is still in effect
throughout the London area.

1009
01:29:55,599 --> 01:30:00,484
Dr. Erskine said that the serum
wouldn't just affect my muscles,

1010
01:30:00,509 --> 01:30:02,568
it would affect my cells.

1011
01:30:03,845 --> 01:30:07,509
Create a protective system
of regeneration and healing.

1012
01:30:07,534 --> 01:30:09,161
Which means...

1013
01:30:11,471 --> 01:30:13,098
...I can't get drunk.

1014
01:30:15,082 --> 01:30:16,641
Did you know that?

1015
01:30:16,643 --> 01:30:20,875
Your metabolism burns four times faster
than the average person.

1016
01:30:22,616 --> 01:30:25,244
He thought
it could be one of the side effects.

1017
01:30:30,257 --> 01:30:32,225
It wasn't your fault.

1018
01:30:33,393 --> 01:30:35,020
- Did you read the report?
- Yes.

1019
01:30:36,261 --> 01:30:37,629
Then you know that's not true.

1020
01:30:37,631 --> 01:30:39,360
You did everything you could.

1021
01:30:42,876 --> 01:30:45,003
Did you believe in your friend?

1022
01:30:45,005 --> 01:30:46,472
Did you respect him?

1023
01:30:48,108 --> 01:30:50,374
Then stop blaming yourself.

1024
01:30:50,377 --> 01:30:52,936
Allow Barnes the dignity of his choice.

1025
01:30:52,947 --> 01:30:55,093
He damn well must have thought
you were worth it.

1026
01:30:57,217 --> 01:30:58,741
I'm going after Schmidt.

1027
01:31:00,377 --> 01:31:03,676
I'm not gonna stop 
until all of Hydra is dead or captured.

1028
01:31:05,626 --> 01:31:07,253
You won't be alone.

1029
01:31:09,920 --> 01:31:13,083
Johann Schmidt belongs in a bughouse.
He thinks he's a god,

1030
01:31:13,085 --> 01:31:15,177
and he's willing to blow up
half the world to prove it,

1031
01:31:15,184 --> 01:31:16,975
starting with the USA.

1032
01:31:16,977 --> 01:31:20,071
Schmidt's working with powers
beyond our capabilities.

1033
01:31:20,073 --> 01:31:21,802
He gets across the Atlantic,

1034
01:31:21,827 --> 01:31:24,309
he will wipe out
the entire Eastern Seaboard in an hour.

1035
01:31:28,782 --> 01:31:30,482
How much time we got?

1036
01:31:30,484 --> 01:31:32,944
According to my new best friend,
under 24 hours.

1037
01:31:33,118 --> 01:31:35,929
- Where is he now?
- Hydra's last base is here.

1038
01:31:36,690 --> 01:31:40,091
In the Alps, 500 feet below the surface.

1039
01:31:42,127 --> 01:31:43,610
So what are we supposed to do?

1040
01:31:43,630 --> 01:31:46,190
I mean, it's not like
we can just knock on the front door.

1041
01:31:46,867 --> 01:31:48,164
Why not?

1042
01:31:53,273 --> 01:31:55,434
That's exactly what we're going to do.

1043
01:34:01,125 --> 01:34:05,221
Arrogance may not be
a uniquely American trait,

1044
01:34:05,223 --> 01:34:07,561
but I must say,
you do it better than anyone.

1045
01:34:10,310 --> 01:34:15,577
But there are limits to
what even you can do, Captain.

1046
01:34:16,163 --> 01:34:19,552
Or did Erskine tell you otherwise?

1047
01:34:19,554 --> 01:34:20,852
He told me you were insane.

1048
01:34:25,916 --> 01:34:31,312
He resented my genius and tried to
deny me what was rightfully mine.

1049
01:34:31,331 --> 01:34:33,090
But he gave you everything.

1050
01:34:35,335 --> 01:34:36,563
So,

1051
01:34:38,371 --> 01:34:40,931
what made you so special?

1052
01:34:44,144 --> 01:34:45,270
Nothing.

1053
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:48,004
I'm just a kid from Brooklyn.

1054
01:34:59,599 --> 01:35:01,157
I can do this all day.

1055
01:35:01,159 --> 01:35:03,328
Of course you can, of course.

1056
01:35:03,330 --> 01:35:06,629
But, unfortunately,
I am on a tight schedule.

1057
01:35:12,479 --> 01:35:13,844
So am I.

1058
01:35:26,186 --> 01:35:29,004
Rogers! You might need this!

1059
01:35:29,605 --> 01:35:30,613
Thanks!

1060
01:35:41,501 --> 01:35:43,992
We're in! Assault team, go!

1061
01:35:44,237 --> 01:35:45,534
Move out!

1062
01:35:46,473 --> 01:35:48,202
Move!

1063
01:35:54,114 --> 01:35:56,139
Keep your spacing!

1064
01:36:35,755 --> 01:36:37,832
Cut off one head, two more shall-

1065
01:36:39,633 --> 01:36:41,294
Let's go find two more!

1066
01:37:08,119 --> 01:37:09,086
You're late.

1067
01:37:12,053 --> 01:37:14,021
- Weren't you about to...
- Right.

1068
01:38:28,555 --> 01:38:29,544
Get in!

1069
01:38:58,272 --> 01:38:59,569
- Keep it steady!
- Wait!

1070
01:39:05,172 --> 01:39:06,366
Go get him.

1071
01:39:08,241 --> 01:39:09,902
I'm not kissing you!

1072
01:42:49,461 --> 01:42:51,921
You don't give up, do you?

1073
01:42:51,923 --> 01:42:52,723
Nope!

1074
01:44:01,401 --> 01:44:03,961
You could have the power of the gods!

1075
01:44:04,671 --> 01:44:09,301
Yet you wear a flag on your chest
and think you fight a battle of nations!

1076
01:44:10,209 --> 01:44:12,336
I have seen the future, Captain!

1077
01:44:13,330 --> 01:44:15,128
There are no flags!

1078
01:44:15,130 --> 01:44:16,346
Not my future!

1079
01:44:30,285 --> 01:44:31,588
What have you done?

1080
01:44:32,231 --> 01:44:33,377
No!

1081
01:45:41,752 --> 01:45:44,062
Come in. This is Captain Rogers.
Do you read me?

1082
01:45:44,064 --> 01:45:45,079
Captain Rogers, what is your-

1083
01:45:45,104 --> 01:45:46,581
Steve, is that you? Are you all right?

1084
01:45:46,606 --> 01:45:48,205
Peggy, Schmidt's dead!

1085
01:45:48,808 --> 01:45:50,332
What about the plane?

1086
01:45:52,211 --> 01:45:53,892
That's a little bit tougher to explain.

1087
01:45:54,147 --> 01:45:56,513
Give me your coordinates.
I'll find you a safe landing site.

1088
01:45:57,817 --> 01:46:00,002
There's not gonna be a safe landing.

1089
01:46:00,277 --> 01:46:01,869
But I can try and force it down.

1090
01:46:01,888 --> 01:46:03,856
I'll get Howard on the line.
He'll know what to do.

1091
01:46:03,858 --> 01:46:05,009
There's not enough time.

1092
01:46:05,032 --> 01:46:07,626
This thing's moving too fast
and it's heading for New York.

1093
01:46:12,265 --> 01:46:14,205
I got to put her in the water.

1094
01:46:14,500 --> 01:46:17,345
Please, don't do this.
We have time. We can work it out.

1095
01:46:17,526 --> 01:46:18,736
Right now I'm in the middle of nowhere.

1096
01:46:18,738 --> 01:46:21,138
If I wait any longer,
a lot of people are gonna die.

1097
01:46:26,772 --> 01:46:27,966
Peggy,

1098
01:46:29,767 --> 01:46:31,029
this is my choice.

1099
01:46:55,208 --> 01:46:56,334
Peggy?

1100
01:46:57,210 --> 01:46:58,507
I'm here.

1101
01:47:01,380 --> 01:47:04,178
I'm gonna need a rain check
on that dance.

1102
01:47:12,391 --> 01:47:13,517
All right.

1103
01:47:16,648 --> 01:47:19,014
A week, next Saturday, at the Stork Club.

1104
01:47:20,532 --> 01:47:21,829
You got it.

1105
01:47:23,722 --> 01:47:27,825
8:00 on the dot.
Don't you dare be late. Understood?

1106
01:47:30,101 --> 01:47:32,333
You know, I still don't know how to dance.

1107
01:47:38,352 --> 01:47:41,450
I'll show you how. Just be there.

1108
01:47:42,588 --> 01:47:44,333
We'll have the band play something slow.

1109
01:47:48,327 --> 01:47:49,252
I'd hate to step on your-

1110
01:47:52,932 --> 01:47:53,899
Steve?

1111
01:47:56,614 --> 01:47:57,911
Steve?

1112
01:48:01,169 --> 01:48:02,363
Steve?

1113
01:49:01,416 --> 01:49:02,883
To the Captain.

1114
01:49:15,162 --> 01:49:16,129
Sir?

1115
01:49:26,273 --> 01:49:28,382
Take us to the next grid point.

1116
01:49:28,384 --> 01:49:30,443
But there's no trace of wreckage.

1117
01:49:31,130 --> 01:49:33,758
And the energy signature stops here.

1118
01:49:34,867 --> 01:49:36,596
Just keep looking.

1119
01:50:45,204 --> 01:50:47,729
Curve ball, high and outside for ball one.

1120
01:50:49,043 --> 01:50:51,737
So the Dodgers are tied, 4-4.

1121
01:50:52,746 --> 01:50:55,112
And the crowd well knows that
with one swing of his bat,

1122
01:50:55,114 --> 01:50:57,981
this fellow's capable of making it
a brand-new game again.

1123
01:50:59,452 --> 01:51:02,580
Just an absolutely gorgeous day
here at Ebbets Field.

1124
01:51:03,456 --> 01:51:06,619
The Phillies have managed
to tie it up at 4-4.

1125
01:51:07,460 --> 01:51:09,758
But the Dodgers have three men on.

1126
01:51:14,417 --> 01:51:17,215
Pearson beaned Reiser in
Philadelphia last month.

1127
01:51:17,217 --> 01:51:20,345
Wouldn't the youngster like a hit here
to return the favor?

1128
01:51:20,806 --> 01:51:22,933
Pete leans in. Here's the pitch.

1129
01:51:23,309 --> 01:51:26,369
Swung on. A line to the right.
And it gets past Rizzo.

1130
01:51:28,314 --> 01:51:29,611
Three runs will score.

1131
01:51:29,982 --> 01:51:33,440
Reiser heads to third.
Durocher's going to wave him in.

1132
01:51:34,487 --> 01:51:36,785
Here comes the relay,
but they won't get him.

1133
01:51:38,257 --> 01:51:39,360
Good morning.

1134
01:51:41,260 --> 01:51:42,955
Or should I say afternoon?

1135
01:51:44,369 --> 01:51:45,393
Where am I?

1136
01:51:46,181 --> 01:51:48,172
You're in a recovery room in New York City.

1137
01:51:49,835 --> 01:51:53,293
The Dodgers take the lead, 8-4.
Oh, Dodgers!

1138
01:51:53,672 --> 01:51:55,469
Everyone is on their feet.

1139
01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:59,467
What a game we have here today, folks.
What a game, indeed.

1140
01:51:59,469 --> 01:52:00,697
Where am I really?

1141
01:52:02,026 --> 01:52:03,994
I'm afraid I don't understand.

1142
01:52:04,710 --> 01:52:06,225
The game.

1143
01:52:06,227 --> 01:52:09,094
It's from May 1941.
I know, 'cause I was there.

1144
01:52:13,103 --> 01:52:16,575
Now, I'm going to ask you again.
Where am I?

1145
01:52:17,904 --> 01:52:19,201
- Captain Rogers...
- Who are you?

1146
01:52:26,839 --> 01:52:28,466
Captain Rogers, wait!

1147
01:52:30,309 --> 01:52:32,004
All agents, code 13!

1148
01:52:32,511 --> 01:52:35,344
I repeat. All agents, code 13!

1149
01:52:56,001 --> 01:52:57,525
At ease, soldier!

1150
01:53:06,150 --> 01:53:09,051
Look, I'm sorry about that little show
back there, but...

1151
01:53:10,349 --> 01:53:13,517
...we thought it best
to break it to you slowly.

1152
01:53:13,519 --> 01:53:14,816
Break what?

1153
01:53:17,256 --> 01:53:21,416
You've been asleep, Cap.
For almost 70 years.

1154
01:53:36,220 --> 01:53:37,527
You gonna be okay?

1155
01:53:38,439 --> 01:53:39,463
Yeah.

1156
01:53:39,778 --> 01:53:41,075
Yeah, I just...

1157
01:53:44,516 --> 01:53:46,006
I had a date.

1158
02:03:07,888 --> 02:03:09,515
Trouble sleeping?

1159
02:03:12,520 --> 02:03:13,817
You're here with a mission, sir?

1160
02:03:14,640 --> 02:03:15,755
I am.

1161
02:03:16,382 --> 02:03:18,179
Trying to get me back in the world?

1162
02:03:19,224 --> 02:03:20,452
Trying to save it.

1163
02:03:29,635 --> 02:03:31,398
You think 
you're the only hero in the world?

1164
02:03:45,776 --> 02:03:46,827
Gentlemen?

1165
02:03:47,524 --> 02:03:48,582
You're up.

1166
02:03:54,976 --> 02:03:55,943
Got a mean swing.
