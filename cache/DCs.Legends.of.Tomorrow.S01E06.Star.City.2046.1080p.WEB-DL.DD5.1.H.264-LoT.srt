- Know what?

- That this is what
would happen in my city?

Oliver said that

That things got so bad

567
00:23:25,538 --> 00:23:27,271
Is because ray and I
weren't there to help.

568
00:23:27,273 --> 00:23:28,773
- I suspected that
might be the case,

understand the pitfalls

00:29:01,841 --> 00:29:04,341
Meddling with the future

Than changing the past,

are in the future.

694

You want us to change that.
- Don't play that card with me.

Are you only willing
to risk the timeline

697
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:18,622
If it's your own family?

698
00:29:18,624 --> 00:29:21,058
- I am not just trying
to save my family

699
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:23,761
And I'm not just trying
to save one city,

700

But the entire world!

701
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:27,798
I'm not being selfish, sara.

702
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,900
- Go to hell.

703
00:29:29,902 --> 00:29:32,302
- Most likely.

704
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:34,371
If you want to go
and save mr. Hawke,

705
00:29:34,373 --> 00:29:35,806
Then be my guest.

706
00:29:35,808 --> 00:29:37,441
I'll keep the ship here
for one hour,

707
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:38,442
Then we're leaving.
