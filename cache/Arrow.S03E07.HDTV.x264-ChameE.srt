After five years in hell,

00:00:05,239 --> 00:00:07,639
I have come home
with only one goal--

4
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:09,441
To save my city.

5
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:10,976
Now others have
joined my crusade.

To them, I am oliver queen.

Previously, on "arrow"...

I killed him. The police officer.
Why didn't you tell me?

12
00:00:25,026 --> 00:00:26,825
Because you were
overdosed on mirakuru;

You didn't remember, and I was
hoping that you never would.

This city still needs saving,

And that is my vision
for this company.

Yes, I am your boss now.

I can quit, which is what
I just did.

I thought that I could be me
and the arrow, but I can't.

Say it's never going to work out
between us. Say you never loved me.

as we talked,

You changed your mind.

With the ceo of a nevada
mining concern.

They own mineral rights,
which are imperative

Ahh, the ceo is boring.
His wife, even more boring.

to go solo on this,

open with a butter knife.

00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:16,495
Did you like your present?

164
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:19,297
Do you mean Isaac Stanzler,
the man you killed?

165
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:22,968
I see the way you take care
of your city.

166
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,504
Makes me wonder...

167
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:27,973
Who takes care of you?

168
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:29,774
I want to help you--

169
00:08:29,776 --> 00:08:31,676
To fight with you,

170
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,512
To kill for you.

171
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:37,516
Mr. Stanzler
was just the first.

[cell phone beeps]

173
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:43,421
He might be the second.

174
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:47,626
I thought we could
punish this one together.

175
00:08:47,628 --> 00:08:49,928
I'm going
to find you.

176
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,596
Well, that's the idea.

177
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:52,964
But you'd better hurry,

178
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:56,067
I don't think
he's got very long.

Oliver: Roy.

180
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:21,393
I was just researching
cheap booze for thea's club.

181
00:09:21,395 --> 00:09:24,663
You know, it wasn't you
who killed that officer.

182
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:27,732
I keep telling myself that,
but it's not working.

Every single time
I put on that mask,

00:09:30,537 --> 00:09:31,937
I feel like a fraud.

You have to give this time.

If you want to talk about it--
I don't.

I appreciate
the offer, though.

Oliver:
What's up?

196

I got an idea

Local mob boss, wanted for 39
counts of murder,

One of the most heavily
protected men in starling city.

I don't know.

205
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:11,943
I can definitely
find out.

206
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,646
Where are we with the cell phone
from her apartment?

Crazy pants encrypted

I can crack it, but it's going
to take some time.

[sighs] which we don't have,
neither does he.

210
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,020
I need 100% of your focus
on finding gravano.

211
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:25,023
And I will work round the clock
on it, except for tonight.

Why?

Ray Palmer
invited me to dinner.

Oh.

215
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:30,462
Not dinner-dinner,
like a date.

216
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:31,763
It's a work dinner,
but since dinner

217
00:10:31,765 --> 00:10:34,566
Is a meal you can technically
only eat at night,

218
00:10:34,568 --> 00:10:37,102

Nothing?

He's not
answering his cell.

224
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,664
Just relax.
I'm sure he's fine.

225
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,799
He said it would
only be an hour.

226
00:11:07,801 --> 00:11:09,501
That was nine hours ago.

227

If he's going to be late,

228

He always calls.

229
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:17,175
He said his contact was
down at the docks, right?

230

I will go down
and check it out.

Trust me, I'm saving you from
wasting your day here.

I don't need saving
from anyone,

And if you're really as good
as you say you are,

00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:12,297
Then you can just wait in line
and prove it like everyone else.

red-headed vixen-type thing.

259
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:43,328
She was a police officer, that
might be why she looks familiar.

260

No, she left the force once year
before you got back from the island.

But there's another
very good reason

Why was she at the crime scene
at ted Grant's gym?

I don't know,
but it's not just there.

Apparently stalking isn't her
only hobby, either.

She's a member
of a gardening group, too.

the whole N.P.P. Thing.

The bag in the gravano

N.P.P., it's an acronym-- stands
for nitrogen, phosphate, potash.

It's the chemical formula
for fertilizer.

323
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:20,545
The department sent her to
st. Walker's for a psych eval.

324
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:23,147
She quit the force
a little bit after.

325
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,115
Where's felicity?

326
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:27,185
She's working tonight.
She said she told you.

327
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:30,655
Yes, she did.

328
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,457
Oliver, you ok?

329
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:34,993
I know this can't be easy,
with felicity spending

330
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:37,729
So much time with palmer.
I'm fine.

331
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:39,564
Where you going?

332
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:41,766
The psychiatrist that SCPD
sent cutter to.

333
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:43,167
You need back up?

334
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:45,837
No. I've got it.

335
00:16:59,651 --> 00:17:01,586
Hey.

336
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:03,087
Like what you've done
to the place.

337
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:04,389
Is everything all right?

338
00:17:04,391 --> 00:17:05,356
Yeah, yeah, I was just

339
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,358
In the neighborhood.
Thought I would stop by

340
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,093
And check out your new sign.

341
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:10,561
Oh, yeah.

342
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:12,263
Phew.

343
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:13,731
[chuckles]

344
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,500
Wow, that's a nice dress.

345
00:17:15,502 --> 00:17:18,369
Yeah, it's really, really,

346
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,638
Really nice.

347
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,374
Ray lent it to me
for a work dinner.

348
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:26,444
Yeah, some...Work dinner.

349
00:17:26,446 --> 00:17:28,846
You and ray. Mm-hmm.

350
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:30,448
Doesn't seem that platonic.

351
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:34,452
Actually, it has oliver
twisted up in knots.

352
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:37,188
Well, oliver made his choice.

353
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:39,657
We both know that was
the wrong choice.

354
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:44,062
Oh, yeah, because oliver's just
great at expressing his emotions.

355
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:46,898
He would rather go ten rounds
with the league of assassins

356
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,433
Than ever say that.

357
00:17:48,435 --> 00:17:50,101
But this thing
with you and palmer,

358
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:52,570
It's, um, it's messing
with his head, felicity,

359
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:55,506
And...That's really dangerous.

360
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:59,110
I told you, there is no
me and palmer.

361
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:00,244
But if there were,

362
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:02,080
And if oliver had
a problem with it,

363
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:06,317
Then oliver should be the one
to say something.

364
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:08,719
Ok.

365
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:13,991
Good night.

366
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,605
Dr. Pressnall--
oh, my god!

367
00:18:27,607 --> 00:18:29,340
I'm not here to hurt you.

368
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:30,141
What do you want?!

369
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:31,776
To talk about
carrie cutter.

370
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,111
I can't.

371
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:35,980
Doctor-patient privilege.
Just please, get out!

372
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:38,716
Your patient killed a man,
kidnapped another,

373
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:42,487
And I'm trying to stop her
before she hurts anyone else.

374
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:45,656
To do that, I need
to understand her.

375
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:48,626
[exhales]
please.

376
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:53,464
I can only diagnose her.

377
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,666
Attachment disorder,

378
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:57,368
The inability to form

379
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,604
Real, lasting relationships.

380
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:01,639
They push everyone away,

381
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,875
And fixate on a single person.

382
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:07,745
Someone they feel mirrors
their emotional state.

383
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:09,780
How do I stop her?

384
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:13,751
Give her the connection
that she craves--

385
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:16,420
Honesty, sincerity...

386
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:18,756
If you lie to her,

387
00:19:18,758 --> 00:19:20,892
She'll know.

388
00:19:20,894 --> 00:19:22,093
Thank you.

389
00:19:22,095 --> 00:19:26,898
If you'll permit a professional
observation...

390
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:30,067
You could use a little
therapy yourself.

391
00:19:30,069 --> 00:19:31,669
What gives you
that impression?

392
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,804
You mean, apart from the mask

393
00:19:33,806 --> 00:19:36,407
And the robin hood costume?

394
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:48,019
Oliver: Shouldn't we
get out and look around

395
00:19:48,021 --> 00:19:49,921
Or, I don't know, something?

396
00:19:49,923 --> 00:19:52,924
In this place,
at this hour?

397
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:56,394
That's a very efficient way
to get yourself killed.

398
00:19:56,396 --> 00:19:58,696
Feel free.

399
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,064
[chuckles]
thank you.

400
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:03,634
That's...
We'll wait, then.

401
00:20:05,404 --> 00:20:07,471
"gaijin."

402
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:09,373
What?

403
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,175
Maseo called me that
before he left,

404
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:14,545
And I looked it up, but it
wasn't in my chinese dictionary.

405
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,515
Because it's japanese.

406
00:20:17,517 --> 00:20:20,618
It means "foreigner."

407
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,487
Outsider.

408
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:25,256
You.

409
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:27,525
It means you, too.

410
00:20:27,527 --> 00:20:30,795
You're japanese,
living in hong kong.

411
00:20:33,632 --> 00:20:36,334
Sorry.

412
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:41,138
Why did you
leave japan?

413
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:45,476
It wasn't safe
for us there.

414
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:47,478
Why?

415
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:51,849
We upset some very powerful,

416
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:54,285
Very dangerous men.

417
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:55,319
Who?

418
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:58,356
You ask a lot of questions.

419
00:20:58,358 --> 00:21:01,492
That's what your husband says.

420
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:03,761
Who's that?

421
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:08,966
Shu gang. Rivals of the triad.
They control this port.

422
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:12,169
So they know what
happened to maseo.

423
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:14,905
I don't know.

424
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:17,975
Only one way to find out.

425
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,386
[speaking chinese]

426
00:21:28,388 --> 00:21:31,088
Hey, I don't want
any trouble!

427
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:35,860
[speaking chinese]

428
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:40,264
[footsteps]

429
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:43,434
What happened to the thing?

430
00:21:43,436 --> 00:21:45,303
Wow.

431
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:47,138
You are
ridiculous.

432
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,673
Um... Which I mean

433
00:21:48,675 --> 00:21:51,542
In a...Good way.
That's...Not creepy.

434
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:54,712
[clears throat]
you look beautiful.

435
00:21:54,714 --> 00:21:56,347
I think it's the dress.

436
00:21:56,349 --> 00:21:58,382
The dress is actually
missing something.

437
00:21:58,384 --> 00:22:01,185
Oh, no, I forgot to do up
the zipper again?

438
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:03,287
I always do that.

439
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:07,258
Oh, no, I can't wear that.

440
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,194
I'm not even sure. I'm supposed
to be looking at it.

441
00:22:10,196 --> 00:22:13,397
Well, I had to put down
a $10,000 security deposit

442
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:14,765
Just to borrow it
for the evening,

443
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:16,067
So one of us should wear it.

444
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:19,003
And diamonds aren't
really my thing, so.

445
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,438
I appreciate it,
but I think I would

446
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:24,675
Feel strange wearing a million
dollar necklace.

447
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:25,643
Oh, don't worry.

448
00:22:25,645 --> 00:22:28,245
It's not worth
a million dollars.

449
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:32,316
Ahh.

450
00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:34,752
I think it was
actually appraised

451
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:37,455
For $10 million.

452
00:22:37,457 --> 00:22:39,623
So...

453
00:22:40,325 --> 00:22:41,726
There you go.

454
00:22:41,728 --> 00:22:44,495
That's better.

455
00:22:45,463 --> 00:22:46,797
Where you been?

456
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,867
You don't call,
you don't write.

457
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:53,103
Carrie: I've been
busy, busy, busy.

458

459
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:57,674
You look good.

460
00:22:57,676 --> 00:23:01,712
Business before pleasure.

461
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,681
First I located every
crime scene

462
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:06,250
The arrow's been spotted at

463
00:23:06,252 --> 00:23:07,384
In the past six months.

464
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,986
Now the magic part--
I created

465
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:11,288
An algorithm, calculated the
average amount of time

466
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,823
It takes the arrow
to reach a crime scene,

467
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:17,961
Triangulated that by the
distance to said scene...

468
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:19,329
[beeping]

469
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:20,964
Genius, right?

470
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:22,833
I wonder why no one
thought to do it before.

471
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:26,403
Now obviously, I can't
pinpoint the exact block,

472
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,171
But, uh, there's no doubt

473
00:23:28,173 --> 00:23:31,208
Your guy hangs his hat
or his hoodie

474
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,709
Somewhere in this area.

475
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:34,645
And you're sure
about this?

476
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:37,347
Statistical correlations
do not lie.

477
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:39,783
Now...

478
00:23:39,785 --> 00:23:42,653
What was this about pleasure?

479
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:45,188
Mmm.

480
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:53,230
[groans]
shh.

481
00:23:53,232 --> 00:23:56,333
I'm sorry.

482
00:23:57,302 --> 00:24:01,004
I'm spoken for.

483
00:24:10,181 --> 00:24:12,249
How'd it go
with cutter's shrink?

484
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:16,086
Oof. There's a reason
I'm not in therapy.

485
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:18,488
[cell phone vibrating]

Carrie,
I'm here to help you,

649
00:32:12,464 --> 00:32:13,797
Because you're not well.

650
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,565
Don't ever say that again.

651
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:19,235
You sound like that shrink
that they sent me to.

652
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:21,237
I spoke to her.

653
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:23,373
You talked to that psycho?

654
00:32:23,375 --> 00:32:25,241
She just wanted me
to take pills,

655
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:27,110
Pills, pills.

656
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:29,846
She thinks that love
is a disease.

657
00:32:29,848 --> 00:32:33,316
But it's not.

658
00:32:33,318 --> 00:32:34,884
Love is the cure.

659
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:37,854
Well, I'm not the man
you think I am.

660
00:32:37,856 --> 00:32:39,556
You're a hero...

661
00:32:39,558 --> 00:32:42,392
Who saved me.

662
00:32:46,263 --> 00:32:48,231
I understand
that you're hurting.

663
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:50,633
And I know
what it's like

664
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,535
To want someone...

665
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:55,872
But not be able
to be with them.

666
00:32:55,874 --> 00:33:00,210
How you wish things can be
different, but they can't.

667
00:33:00,212 --> 00:33:01,845
I can't be with you.

668
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:04,214
I can't be with anyone.

669
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:07,450
I have to be alone.

670
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,287
Carrie: No, you don't.

671
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:15,124
You're a liar!

672
00:33:19,029 --> 00:33:21,798
I don't want to hurt you!

673
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,067
You already have.

It's over, carrie.

00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:52,795
I guess it's true
what they say--

678
00:33:52,797 --> 00:33:56,900
You only hurt
the ones you love.

Get him back.

Sorry.

685
00:34:17,188 --> 00:34:19,022
But if I can't
have you--

686
00:34:19,024 --> 00:34:20,423
Carrie, think about this!

687
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:22,759
I didn't want it
to end this way.

688
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:25,662
I guess I don't handle
rejection very well.

689
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:28,064
You don't have to do this.

[train horn honking]

691
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:33,836
I do.

692
00:34:34,371 --> 00:34:36,372
But at least this way,

693
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:38,808
We can be together.

694

For eternity.

00:34:56,961 --> 00:35:01,097

Well, it's done.

Than the last woman they
had in the suicide squad.

699

You sure this was
a good idea,

700
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:18,548
Handing her over
to waller?

701
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,783
Iron heights
isn't right for her.

702
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:24,220
At least, on the squad,

703
00:35:24,222 --> 00:35:26,589
She can make a difference.

Lyla is preparing

If you want to join.

00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:33,663
No.

707
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:35,865
No, I'm good, thank you.

708
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:38,434
Listen, oliver...

709
00:35:38,436 --> 00:35:41,070
Felicity heard what
you said to cutter.

710
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:42,605
About being alone.

711

If her reaction
was any indication,

712
00:35:45,043 --> 00:35:48,211
She does not want to be.

713
00:35:48,512 --> 00:35:50,413
You got to tell her
how you feel

714
00:35:50,415 --> 00:35:52,215
Before it's too late.

It's just food

What do I tell him?

How do I tell my son
his father is dead?

Where have you two been?

720
00:36:30,387 --> 00:36:32,422
What's going on?

721
00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:34,590
You're home.

722
00:36:34,592 --> 00:36:36,125
I was so worried.

723
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:38,861
I know. I'm sorry.
I should have called.

724
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,264
Waller changed my orders
and brought me in.

725
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:42,498
We were on lockdown tonight

726
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,702
Because three agents
got killed.

727

Pretty good
gate tonight.

You're never going to let me
forget this, are you?

00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:22,371
You have to admit,
I did save your ass.

it's so refreshing.

Aha. I thought I might
find you here.

is vastly different from mine.
