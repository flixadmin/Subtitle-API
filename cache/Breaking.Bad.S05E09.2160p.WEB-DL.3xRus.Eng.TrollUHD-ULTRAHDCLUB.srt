1
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:37,663
That was nasty, man.

2
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:04,619
Hello, Carol.

3
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,570
{\an8}- She's so cute.
- I know, isn't she?

4
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:41,198
{\an8}She takes after her mother.

5
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,206
{\an8}Well, thank goodness for that.

6
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:03,094
{\an8}Okay, everybody, since you were so good,

7
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:08,350
{\an8}and you ate all your dinner, everybody.

8
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:14,356
{\an8}Is sweetie hungry? Sweetie, pumpkin pie,
this one's for you. That one's for you.

9
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:51,560
{\an8}She's got a lot more hair than you do.

10
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:56,982
{\an8}Yes. You wear that so well. You do.

11
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:06,121
{\an8}- Look at what I have. Special one for you.
- Oh, my God

12
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,076
Skyler. I'll take the pink one.

13
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,494
It's a pink one.

14
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:11,872
- Skyler.
- I know, right?

15
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:15,500
Well, actually, they were my idea.
You are all welcome.

16
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:18,128
- You are the devil.
- Oh, my gosh.

17
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,840
{\an8}Hey, buddy. Ready for a cold one?

18
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,466
{\an8}No, no.

19
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:27,178
{\an8}- Not feeling 100 percent.
- Oh, I hope it's not something you ate.

20
00:06:27,262 --> 00:06:28,972
{\an8}No, no. I just...

21
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,141
{\an8}We have Pepto, Uncle Hank.

22
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:32,934
Yeah.

23
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,937
No, I'm good, I...
I think we need to shove off.

24
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:38,231
- Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

25
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:40,024
Sorry, Skyler, I hate to leave...

26
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:44,362
- No, no. Don't worry about it. I have help.
- And by that, she means me.

27
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:47,073
- That is correct.
- Holly can help.

28
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,576
- Let's go send them on their way.
- Yeah.

29
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:52,829
{\an8}- Let's say goodbye to auntie and uncle.
- Been too long.

30
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,457
{\an8}- Say, "Bye, auntie."
- Bye, sweetie, bye-bye.

31
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:58,710
{\an8}You know, it's been about 100 years
since we've been bowling.

32
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:01,629
{\an8}- Then how about Thursday night?
- Oh, that sounds great.

33
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,381
Thank you for having us.

34
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,509
- Yeah, absolutely. Take care of him.
- Hey. You okay to drive?

35
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:08,011
Yeah.

36
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:12,098
All right, well, feel better.

37
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,145
Say, "Bye, Uncle Hank. Bye-bye."

38
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:22,025
"Bye, Uncle Hank. Bye, Aunt Marie."

39
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:25,070
{\an8}All right, let's get started on
those dishes. Come on.

40
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,279
{\an8}- You.
- You.

41
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,781
{\an8}- No, you.
- You.

42
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,492
{\an8}- Washing, okay?
- I'll dry. You wash.

43
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,410
{\an8}- You're a good washer.
- Hello, Carol.

44
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,955
Oh, hi, Walt.

45
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,623
Europe.

46
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,459
{\an8}I can't believe it.
Were you there when she said that?

47
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,086
{\an8}Yeah.

48
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:43,254
{\an8}You okay? Your stomach okay?

49
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,007
{\an8}- Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
- Okay.

50
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:49,094
{\an8}God, Jesus, Europe.

51
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:50,845
{\an8}I just...

52
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:54,140
{\an8}And, you know, where they were
three or four months ago.

53
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:57,644
She was talking about it
like it was a second honeymoon.

54
00:07:57,852 --> 00:08:00,522
{\an8}- We need to go to Europe. We could go.
- Yeah.

55
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:03,149
{\an8}Have it be like a business trip,
you know?

56
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:08,571
{\an8}It could be Italy. To Lake Como...

57
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,502
Hank? Hank?

58
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,296
Hank? You okay?

59
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,757
Hank!

60
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,805
Oh, my God. Hank?

61
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:36,016
Hank? Hank?

62
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,353
Oh, my God. Hank?

63
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:43,440
- No. Are you okay?
- I'm good.

64
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,693
Call an ambulance!
Call an ambulance!

65
00:08:47,277 --> 00:08:48,528
Okay. You okay?

66
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,030
Just take a breath. Yeah.

67
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,073
Oh, God, sweetie.

68
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:54,825
{\an8}- An accident. It happens.
- I'll make the appointment.

69
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,287
{\an8}- All you have to do is show up.
- For what?

70
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:00,540
Three hours in the emergency room,
all for nothing.

71
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:02,750
{\an8}All they did was rule out a heart attack.

72
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:05,211
{\an8}- What if it happens again?
- It won't happen again.

73
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,672
{\an8}How can you know that?
You can't say what it was.

74
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:12,802
{\an8}Marie, baby. I'm okay. I'm fine, trust me.
Discussion over.

75
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,930
{\an8}- And do not tell Skyler.
- What? Why?

76
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,599
{\an8}Just don't.

77
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:20,769
{\an8}There's nothing to be
embarrassed about. Hank?

78
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,794
{\an8}Luis.

79
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,254
Enrique.

80
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,132
Hi.

81
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,050
Hi.

82
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,471
Okay.

83
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,184
Here you go. There's complimentary
coffee inside. Have an A-1 day.

84
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,688
Air fresheners are high-margin, right?

85
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,398
At 30 cents wholesale? Yeah.

86
00:10:48,565 --> 00:10:51,568
Right. So I'm thinking
we reorganize the display.

87
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:53,986
Separate the food scents
from the nature scents.

88
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:58,616
I mean, does bubble gum belong
anywhere near ocean spray? No.

89
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:01,494
And pine is still
our biggest seller, right?

90
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:06,833
So maybe we move that over to the cash
register, by the 5-hour Energy drink.

91
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,711
- Sure. That'd be fine.
- Yeah, yeah.

92
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,462
Come here.

93
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,008
Speaking of the business

94
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,427
the story comes first.

95
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:20,930
The story is, is that we are
car wash owners, pure and simple.

96
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:24,893
But if our story is that
the car wash is successful

97
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,146
then what do successful
car wash owners do?

98
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:31,316
They buy more car washes.

99
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,068
Listen.

100
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:38,573
Skyler, you'll be laundering
that money for years.

101
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,533
Decades.

102
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:43,494
Wouldn't two be better than one?

103
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:50,126
Well, there's Gentle Hands
over by Kirtland. I do love that location.

104
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,088
I'll think about it.

105
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:58,092
Yeah. Right, right. To be continued.

106
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,261
Okay.

107
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,474
Good morning. Welcome to A-1.

108
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,267
Just the regular, please.

109
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:09,187
Well, we're having a special
on hand wax, 21.99

110
00:12:09,354 --> 00:12:12,273
if you're interested
in getting rid of those water spots.

111
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:13,942
Just the regular is fine.

112
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:17,862
Okay. Well, there's complimentary
coffee inside while you're waiting.

113
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,365
Have an A-1 day.

114
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:29,415
Please give this to your car wash
professional, and have an A-1 day.

115
00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:36,755
Sixty-eight percent. And falling.

116
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,123
Good morning.
May I have your ticket, please?

117
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:42,595
I knew there would be a drop in quality,
but 68 percent?

118
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:45,848
This is not what I agreed to.

119
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:51,854
I left a viable operation.
The rest was up to you.

120
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:55,692
- May I have your ticket, please?
- I'm only asking for a few days

121
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,319
a week at most. Call it a tutorial.

122
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,488
That's the standard wash.

123
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:05,827
Fix this. Get the ship back on course.
We'll make it worth your while.

124
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:09,289
That'll be 14.95, please.

125
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:16,671
Listen, this is a complicated situation.
There are a lot of moving parts.

126
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:20,174
None of which are my concern.

127
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:24,012
You're putting me in a box here.

128
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,347
You know what could happen.

129
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:31,352
Again, none of my concern.

130
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,064
There's your change, and if you'll hand
this to your car wash professional.

131
00:13:35,148 --> 00:13:36,983
And have an A-1 day.

132
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:45,241
- Listen...
- It'll only be a few more minutes.

133
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,869
There's some complimentary coffee,
if you like.

134
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,467
What's up?

135
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:06,012
Just wondering who washes a rental car.

136
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,267
Walt, who was that?

137
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:18,358
She's a former business associate

138
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,568
who wants me to go back.

139
00:14:21,486 --> 00:14:23,279
And I won't.

140
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:40,755
Enrique, this one's finished.

141
00:14:43,508 --> 00:14:45,426
Get out of here.

142
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,636
Now.

143
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:48,429
Excuse me?

144
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,932
Never come back here.

145
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,392
Do you understand me?

146
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,228
- I...
- Go.

147
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,753
- Hey.
- Hey.

148
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,213
Oh, thanks.

149
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,300
You going in today?

150
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,843
No. No, no.

151
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:31,210
Good. You know, stay out of there
till you're sure you're better.

152
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,765
- Yeah.
- Stay home, rest

153
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:34,808
- don't even think about work.
- Okay.

154
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,394
- All right? I'll see you later.
- All right.

155
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:55,276
- Morning, Mrs. Schrader.
- Hey, guys. What's going on?

156
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,288
Dropping these off.
Where'd you like them?

157
00:15:57,372 --> 00:16:00,667
Bring them around
to the garage, guys. I got it.

158
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,503
Have a good day.

159
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,255
You too.

160
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:10,760
Boss, Janice said to tell you a few
of them might not have indexes.

161
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,013
We could give you a hand
sorting through them.

162
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,723
No, I got it, thanks.

163
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,602
All right.

164
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,065
- Well, see you, boss.
- Okay.

165
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,359
Okay...

166
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:26,146
Dude, you are tripping. I'm not dead.

167
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,316
I'm on the starship <i>Enterprise,</i>
macking on Yeoman Rand

168
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:33,987
while the Andorian with the disruptor
is back on Talos IV, or whatever.

169
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,531
What do you think
all those sparkles and shit are?

170
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,575
Transporters are breaking you apart, man.

171
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,995
Down to your molecules and bones.
They're making a copy.

172
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:46,708
That dude who comes out on the other
side? He's not you. He's a color Xerox.

173
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:51,255
So you're telling me every time Kirk went
into the transporter he was killing himself?

174
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:54,967
So over the whole series,
there's, like, 147 Kirks?

175
00:18:55,133 --> 00:19:00,973
At least. Dude, why do you think
McCoy never likes to beam nowhere?

176
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:05,435
Because he's a doctor, bitch.
Look it up. It's science.

177
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:10,399
I ever tell you about
my <i>Star Trek </i>script?

178
00:19:10,565 --> 00:19:14,069
<i>- Star Trek </i>script?
- Yeah. I gotta write it down, is all.

179
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:19,700
The <i>Enterprise</i>
is five parsecs out of Rigel XII.

180
00:19:19,866 --> 00:19:22,411
Nothing's going on.
Neutral zone is quiet.

181
00:19:22,577 --> 00:19:26,623
The crew is bored,
so they put on a pie-eating contest.

182
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,709
The whole crew's in the galley.
They're eating tulaberry pies.

183
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:32,587
- Tulaberry?
- Tulaberries, from Gamma Quadrant, yo.

184
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:35,424
- That's <i>Voyager, </i>dude.
- Okay, blueberries, then.

185
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:37,675
- They're eating blueberry pies...
- Better.

186
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:42,180
...as fast as the replicator
can churn them out:

187
00:19:43,598 --> 00:19:47,769
Finally it's down to just three:
Kirk, Spock and Chekov.

188
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:50,355
Okay, Spock always wins these things.

189
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:53,692
How is Spock gonna beat Kirk, yo?
Spock's like a toothbrush.

190
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,693
Look at Kirk. He's got room to spare.

191
00:19:55,777 --> 00:20:00,282
Spock has total Vulcan control over his
digestion. You wanna hear this or not?

192
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:03,327
- Yeah. Yeah, go.
- Okay. Finally, Kirk

193
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:06,204
he can't take it anymore. He yorks.

194
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:09,124
Now it's just down to Chekov and Spock.

195
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:14,921
But Chekov, you see, he's got a whole
fat stack of quatloos riding on this,

196
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:17,841
and he has figured out a way to win.

197
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:22,054
He's got Scotty back in the Transporter
Room locked in on Chekov's stomach.

198
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,349
Every time Chekov eats a pie,
Scotty beams it right out of him.

199
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,018
- Where's he sending them? The toilet?
- Space.

200
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:33,148
There's blueberries just floating out
there, frozen, because it's in space.

201
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:35,984
And Chekov is just
shoveling them into his mouth,

202
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:39,654
and Spock's like, "I can't believe
this Russian is defeating me."

203
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,199
Meanwhile,
Scotty's in the Transporter Room

204
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,619
fiddling with levers
when Lieutenant Uhura comes in.

205
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:50,582
She's got, you know, her big pointies,
and Scotty's fingers are all sweaty.

206
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,584
- No.
- Chekov screams.

207
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,379
He sprays blood out of his mouth.

208
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,465
Scotty beamed his guts into space.

209
00:20:58,673 --> 00:20:59,716
No way.

210
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:04,930
Hey, man, where you going?
You're missing the best part.

211
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,724
Just fill this out, bring it back to me.

212
00:21:26,493 --> 00:21:27,536
Yo.

213
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:31,832
Yo.

214
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:10,245
You know you can't smoke that up in here.

215
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:20,589
Yeah, Jesse Pinkman's
out here smoking pot.

216
00:22:20,755 --> 00:22:22,799
Give me a break, man.

217
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:30,307
Pinkman. He'll see you now.

218
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:35,270
Woody Harrelson, live and in person.
Pull up a bong and take a seat.

219
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:38,648
Hey, I'm kidding about the bong.
Don't be doing that.

220
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:42,151
Sorry to keep you on ice out there, kid.
If I'd known it was you...

221
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:44,987
Well, that Francesca,
I've warned her before.

222
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:48,408
One more time and it's back to the DMV.

223
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:52,913
So are we on our own today?

224
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:54,831
Barn door open.

225
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:56,958
Barn door?

226
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:03,215
So how is the maestro?
Things have been quiet on this end.

227
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:04,925
I haven't seen him.

228
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,511
Just as well, probably.

229
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:10,347
That whole thing in the jails.
I mean

230
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:13,755
when they start to whack lawyers,
that's when I draw the line.

231
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:17,437
This goes to Kaylee Ehrmantraut,

232
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:23,151
and that goes to
Mr. and Mrs. Albert Sharp

233
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:28,240
315 East Pueblo.
It's up in White Horse.

234
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:32,661
It's 2 and a half million each.
Total of 5.

235
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,456
Mr. and Mrs. who?

236
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,875
Drew Sharp's parents.

237
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:41,628
Drew Sharp? That's the kid on TV?

238
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,464
The missing...?
So but why would you...?

239
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:48,718
Scratch that. I don't know,
and I don't wanna know.

240
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:53,264
The thing is, what those folks want
is to know what happened to their boy.

241
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:57,477
A sack full of cash on their doorstep?
That's just gonna raise more questions.

242
00:23:57,894 --> 00:24:00,939
Kaylee Ehrmantraut?
That's Mike's granddaughter?

243
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:04,818
- So this is Mike's money?
- It's mine.

244
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:10,198
It's your money. Okay. And you're
giving it to Kaylee Ehrmantraut...?

245
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,242
It's what Mike wanted.

246
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:18,415
So you and Mike, you've been in touch?

247
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,464
So we're just talking about charity?

248
00:24:26,881 --> 00:24:28,300
Yeah.

249
00:24:29,091 --> 00:24:33,763
Okay, look, you know, shelling out
money to the ex and her little boy

250
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:38,935
I kind of get it. I mean, kind of.
But this, this is a bridge too far.

251
00:24:39,101 --> 00:24:43,940
I'm sorry to say, kid, but you're still
gonna be two miracles short of sainthood.

252
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:50,030
Brass tacks.
Okay, my job is to advise,

253
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:53,742
and my advice is, come on, already.

254
00:24:53,908 --> 00:24:56,202
Mike left one step ahead
of the boys in blue.

255
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:58,569
You better believe
his family's on the radar.

256
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:01,541
A couple million bucks shows up,
they're gonna snatch it.

257
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,126
The feds have already taken
Kaylee's money twice.

258
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:07,672
- What, are you going for a hat trick?
- I'll freaking do it myself, Saul.

259
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,806
No, no, no! I was just thinking out loud.

260
00:25:09,924 --> 00:25:12,719
Enough bullshit, Saul.
Are you gonna do this or not?

261
00:25:12,927 --> 00:25:16,097
Yes, yes. Absolutely. I live to serve.

262
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:23,188
And, kid, you might wanna think about
cleaning up a little, getting some rest.

263
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,982
- You've looked better.
- Just get it done.

264
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,785
You know who this is?
Don't hang up on me.

265
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,205
Yeah, there's a problem.

266
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,165
There's 5 million of them
here in my office.

267
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:47,087
No, no, don't. Just hold on to it.

268
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:49,964
Yes.

269
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,591
Ye...

270
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,259
Yes.

271
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,512
Calm down.

272
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,474
I'll handle it.

273
00:26:59,453 --> 00:27:01,413
Déjà vu, huh?

274
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,083
Jesus.

275
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:07,502
All right, look

276
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,370
you wanna talk me through this?

277
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,633
What you were thinking?

278
00:27:15,844 --> 00:27:19,222
What you asked Saul to do.
I mean, come on.

279
00:27:19,389 --> 00:27:21,516
It's just nonsensical.

280
00:27:31,026 --> 00:27:32,611
Do you...?

281
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:36,406
Do you have any explanation at all?

282
00:27:38,658 --> 00:27:41,453
- Blood money.
- What?

283
00:27:43,121 --> 00:27:44,997
It's like you said.

284
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,876
It's blood money.

285
00:27:48,084 --> 00:27:49,461
I sa...?

286
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:56,008
Jesus. Okay, yes, all right. I said that.

287
00:27:56,426 --> 00:27:57,928
I did.

288
00:27:59,513 --> 00:28:04,226
But it was in the heat of the moment.
I was trying to win an argument.

289
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:06,937
All right? And I was wrong.

290
00:28:09,064 --> 00:28:11,107
This is your money.

291
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:13,652
Come on, you've earned it.

292
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:36,466
Drew Sharp.

293
00:28:38,301 --> 00:28:41,471
That is a terrible memory,
no doubt about it.

294
00:28:44,683 --> 00:28:46,351
But, son

295
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:52,482
you need to stop focusing
on the darkness behind you.

296
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:55,235
The past is the past.

297
00:28:59,614 --> 00:29:02,826
Look, nothing can change what we've done.

298
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:06,955
But now that's over.

299
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:09,624
You're out.

300
00:29:10,834 --> 00:29:12,586
And so am I.

301
00:29:15,672 --> 00:29:18,550
That's right. I'm done.

302
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:23,263
I've been out for about a month.

303
00:29:26,016 --> 00:29:32,147
But there is nothing left
for us to do except to try

304
00:29:32,522 --> 00:29:34,065
to live

305
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,194
ordinary, decent lives.

306
00:29:53,543 --> 00:29:56,254
Why Kaylee Ehrmantraut?

307
00:29:59,215 --> 00:30:01,843
She needs someone looking after her.

308
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:09,059
Mike is perfectly capable
of looking after his own granddaughter.

309
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:12,562
I don't think so.

310
00:30:13,772 --> 00:30:16,358
I don't think he is capable.

311
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,110
I don't think he's coming back.

312
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:22,447
What...? What are you saying?

313
00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:26,951
You doing what you did

314
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:29,996
offing Mike's guys?

315
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:35,752
If he was out there, you'd have to look over
your shoulder for the rest of your life.

316
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:40,840
And that's not how you do things.
So I think he's dead,

317
00:30:41,508 --> 00:30:43,593
and I think you know that.

318
00:30:45,845 --> 00:30:47,889
I don't know that.

319
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:53,061
I don't.

320
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:56,356
Listen to me.

321
00:30:57,357 --> 00:31:00,276
I did not kill Mike.

322
00:31:01,653 --> 00:31:06,825
The last time that I saw him, he had
his bag, the one that I brought him.

323
00:31:06,991 --> 00:31:09,119
And he got into his car,
and he drove away.

324
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:12,330
And for all I know, he's alive and well.

325
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:16,376
And if...

326
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:22,590
If he does come back and he doesn't
understand why I had to do what I did

327
00:31:23,883 --> 00:31:26,678
well, then, that's on me.

328
00:31:30,265 --> 00:31:31,850
Jesse?

329
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,604
I need you to believe this.

330
00:31:41,735 --> 00:31:44,654
It's not true. It's just not.

331
00:31:46,865 --> 00:31:48,658
So he's out there?

332
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:51,161
He's okay?

333
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:52,787
Yes.

334
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:57,083
Mike is fine, wherever he is.

335
00:31:58,209 --> 00:32:01,379
We both know
that he can take care of himself.

336
00:32:02,797 --> 00:32:07,969
And he's certainly capable
to provide for his own family. Okay?

337
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:12,766
Jesse.

338
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:17,520
I need you to believe me.

339
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:23,026
Yeah.

340
00:32:23,485 --> 00:32:25,278
Like you said.

341
00:32:26,404 --> 00:32:27,989
He's alive.

342
00:32:30,825 --> 00:32:32,160
Yeah.

343
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:36,039
Mike's alive.

344
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:45,006
Absolutely.

345
00:32:53,139 --> 00:32:56,339
You've got to have a counselor.
Are they bringing in someone new?

346
00:32:56,434 --> 00:32:59,354
I don't know. Maybe she'll be back.

347
00:32:59,521 --> 00:33:03,650
What if she's not? What are you
supposed to do? What's Louis gonna do?

348
00:33:03,817 --> 00:33:05,360
He's not worried.

349
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:09,322
Oh, yeah, sure. What's there to worry
about? It's only college, right?

350
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:10,824
Right.

351
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:13,576
College. Nothing more important.

352
00:33:13,785 --> 00:33:16,830
Oh, you know,
Uncle Hank's still not feeling well,

353
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:18,790
so bowling's off tomorrow night.

354
00:33:18,957 --> 00:33:20,458
- Really?
- Really.

355
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:23,211
So you're spared
a night out with the family.

356
00:33:23,837 --> 00:33:25,887
You do not have to look
so happy about it.

357
00:33:26,005 --> 00:33:27,882
I'll be right back.

358
00:33:31,052 --> 00:33:37,392
So if bowling's off,
can I get a late curfew?

359
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:56,471
Are you gonna turn off the light?

360
00:34:56,846 --> 00:34:59,057
Have you seen <i>Leaves of Grass?</i>

361
00:35:00,934 --> 00:35:02,644
My book.

362
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:04,979
Walt Whitman.
Dark green hardcover.

363
00:35:05,146 --> 00:35:07,523
I didn't even know we had that.

364
00:35:16,324 --> 00:35:18,618
You don't think Junior...?

365
00:35:18,785 --> 00:35:20,787
You're kidding, right?

366
00:35:21,955 --> 00:35:23,498
Well

367
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:25,875
it'll show up.

368
00:35:42,433 --> 00:35:44,310
What's wrong with Hank?

369
00:35:46,729 --> 00:35:49,524
It's a stomach bug, sounds like.

370
00:35:49,774 --> 00:35:52,110
He hasn't been to work all week.

371
00:35:55,071 --> 00:35:57,991
Well, good night.

372
00:35:59,742 --> 00:36:01,077
Night.

373
00:38:10,164 --> 00:38:12,583
Mister. Can you help me out?

374
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,585
Spare some change?

375
00:38:25,972 --> 00:38:27,348
Hey.

376
00:38:27,849 --> 00:38:28,933
Come back.

377
00:38:29,142 --> 00:38:33,312
Yeah. You. Come here,
I got something for you.

378
00:38:38,818 --> 00:38:40,361
Here.

379
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:42,071
Take it.

380
00:38:42,822 --> 00:38:43,906
Go ahead.

381
00:38:45,533 --> 00:38:47,160
Just take it.

382
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:52,081
Take it.

383
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,169
Yeah.

384
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,461
Anything you want us to tell Steve Gomez?

385
00:39:38,628 --> 00:39:40,213
Says he's worried about you.

386
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:43,299
Yeah. Tell him I already
got two grandmas.

387
00:39:44,717 --> 00:39:49,096
Listen, tell everybody
more work and less worry.

388
00:39:51,182 --> 00:39:53,684
- Guess we better hit it.
- Yeah.

389
00:39:54,477 --> 00:39:55,895
Yeah.

390
00:40:15,122 --> 00:40:16,999
- Hey, guys.
- Walt.

391
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:18,625
- How are you?
- Good to see you.

392
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:20,127
How you doing?

393
00:40:20,294 --> 00:40:22,255
Well, you know, I can't complain.

394
00:40:22,421 --> 00:40:24,799
How's your son's arm?
I was thinking about that.

395
00:40:24,966 --> 00:40:28,552
- Back to 100 percent. Going to district.
- Gonna be exciting. This Saturday?

396
00:40:28,636 --> 00:40:31,973
This Saturday morning.
I think first pitch is at 10 a.m.

397
00:40:32,473 --> 00:40:35,023
- Yeah, yeah. It'll be fun.
- Should be a big crowd.

398
00:40:35,393 --> 00:40:37,812
Guys, you're still on the clock here.
Let's go.

399
00:40:37,979 --> 00:40:41,399
- See you, Walt.
- See you, Artie. All right, Scott. Be well.

400
00:40:45,987 --> 00:40:49,282
- They're good guys, huh?
- Yeah, they're good guys.

401
00:40:49,448 --> 00:40:52,118
- Well, it's good to see you up and about.
- Yeah.

402
00:40:52,285 --> 00:40:56,122
- How are you feeling?
- Well, you know. I've been better, but...

403
00:40:57,915 --> 00:40:59,458
- Yeah.
- Have you...?

404
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:01,525
Did you get to see a doctor? I mean

405
00:41:01,669 --> 00:41:04,379
when one of these things
lasts more than three days

406
00:41:04,463 --> 00:41:08,926
- you really should get that checked.
- Yeah, no, I did, and I'm fine

407
00:41:09,093 --> 00:41:11,386
I'm, what they say,
on the upswing, you know?

408
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,514
- Good. Good to hear.
- Yeah.

409
00:41:15,558 --> 00:41:19,103
When I heard you weren't
going in to work, I... Well...

410
00:41:20,062 --> 00:41:22,898
Looks like you have the work
coming to you.

411
00:41:23,065 --> 00:41:25,401
Perks of being the boss, huh?

412
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,820
You know.

413
00:41:30,614 --> 00:41:33,492
How's...?
How's things at the car wash?

414
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:35,328
- Good.
- Yeah?

415
00:41:36,662 --> 00:41:37,788
Yeah, really good.

416
00:41:39,957 --> 00:41:42,626
Hey, did you have
any of that potato salad?

417
00:41:44,503 --> 00:41:47,803
- I don't know. Maybe. Maybe.
- Yeah, I mean, no one else got sick,

418
00:41:47,923 --> 00:41:50,217
so I probably shouldn't worry about it.

419
00:41:54,513 --> 00:41:57,813
Well, Skyler will be very happy
to hear that you're feeling better.

420
00:41:57,933 --> 00:42:01,479
Which reminds me,
I better get back to it.

421
00:42:04,231 --> 00:42:06,525
If there's anything I can do...

422
00:42:13,324 --> 00:42:14,784
Feel better.

423
00:42:27,463 --> 00:42:28,923
You know...

424
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:35,930
you're gonna laugh,
but I have to ask you about this.

425
00:42:36,972 --> 00:42:40,226
Believe it or not,
I found this on my car.

426
00:42:40,393 --> 00:42:45,022
I mean, it looks just like the GPS tracker
that we used on Gus Fring, doesn't it?

427
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,734
Back when we were tracking him,
just the two of us.

428
00:42:50,694 --> 00:42:53,572
You wouldn't know anything about this,
would you, Hank?

429
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:11,382
You okay?

430
00:43:12,508 --> 00:43:16,470
I gotta say, I don't like the way
you're looking at me right now.

431
00:43:30,151 --> 00:43:31,902
It was you.

432
00:43:32,069 --> 00:43:34,321
All along, it was you!

433
00:43:34,989 --> 00:43:37,199
You son of a bitch.

434
00:43:37,366 --> 00:43:39,826
You drove into traffic
to keep me from that laundry.

435
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:41,454
Calm down.

436
00:43:42,413 --> 00:43:45,163
That call I got, telling me Marie
was in the hospital

437
00:43:45,249 --> 00:43:47,042
that wasn't Pinkman.

438
00:43:48,294 --> 00:43:49,920
You had my cell number.

439
00:43:50,129 --> 00:43:53,299
You killed 10 witnesses
to save your sorry ass.

440
00:43:53,466 --> 00:43:56,177
- Listen to me.
- You bombed a nursing home.

441
00:43:57,470 --> 00:44:00,806
Heisenberg. Heisenberg.

442
00:44:00,973 --> 00:44:03,267
You lying, two-faced sack of shit.

443
00:44:03,434 --> 00:44:04,894
Hank.

444
00:44:05,144 --> 00:44:08,230
Look, I don't know where this is
coming from, Hank, but just...

445
00:44:08,314 --> 00:44:10,149
I swear to Christ

446
00:44:10,316 --> 00:44:13,985
- I will put you under the jail.
- Take a breath, okay? Listen to yourself.

447
00:44:14,069 --> 00:44:17,364
These wild accusations, they could
destroy our family. And for what?

448
00:44:17,448 --> 00:44:19,742
You don't give a shit about family!

449
00:44:26,457 --> 00:44:29,168
Hank, my cancer is back.

450
00:44:29,877 --> 00:44:31,212
Good.

451
00:44:32,379 --> 00:44:34,673
Rot, you son of a bitch.

452
00:44:35,925 --> 00:44:37,885
I'm sorry you feel that way.

453
00:44:39,053 --> 00:44:41,430
I wanna beat this thing, I do.

454
00:44:41,597 --> 00:44:44,975
I'm back on chemo,
and I am fighting like hell.

455
00:44:47,102 --> 00:44:53,108
But the truth is, in six months,
you won't have someone to prosecute.

456
00:44:54,944 --> 00:44:56,695
But even...

457
00:44:56,862 --> 00:45:02,243
Even if somehow you were
able to convince anyone

458
00:45:03,369 --> 00:45:06,247
that I was capable of doing these things

459
00:45:06,747 --> 00:45:12,461
you and I both know I would
never see the inside of a jail cell.

460
00:45:17,007 --> 00:45:18,968
I'm a dying man

461
00:45:19,552 --> 00:45:21,178
who runs a car wash.

462
00:45:21,345 --> 00:45:26,100
My right hand to God,
that is all that I am.

463
00:45:30,688 --> 00:45:32,398
What's the point?

464
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:39,989
Have Skyler bring the kids here.

465
00:45:40,823 --> 00:45:42,825
And then we'll talk.

466
00:45:47,037 --> 00:45:49,540
That is not going to happen.

467
00:45:55,504 --> 00:45:57,673
I don't know who you are.

468
00:45:59,925 --> 00:46:02,761
I don't even know who I'm talking to.

469
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:08,601
If that's true

470
00:46:09,935 --> 00:46:13,439
if you don't know who I am...

471
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:20,654
then maybe your best course

472
00:46:21,989 --> 00:46:24,825
would be to tread lightly.
