2
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,582
Come on.

3
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,842
Come on.

4
00:02:58,345 --> 00:03:00,088
Come...

5
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:03,140
Come on. Come on, baby.

6
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:08,803
Please, please. Come on, come on.
Come on!

7
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:39,339
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

8
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:10,160
Yeah.

9
00:04:12,294 --> 00:04:16,374
Slow down. Slow... Slow down.

10
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,626
And just... Just take a deep breath.

11
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:21,463
Do it.

12
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:23,721
All right.

13
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,466
Now, what happened?

14
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,063
All right. All right. Now...

15
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:48,411
...listen... Listen to me.
Are you listening?

16
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:52,118
Everything is gonna be okay.
I promise.

17
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,374
No, no... Listen. Calm down.

18
00:04:54,586 --> 00:04:56,080
Just...

19
00:04:56,964 --> 00:05:00,498
Sit tight. I know who to call.

20
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,032
Saul Goodman sent me.

21
00:05:38,714 --> 00:05:41,419
Come on. Inside.

22
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,640
Watch the door.

23
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:55,472
Where is she?

24
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,401
Any other drugs in the house?

25
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:36,369
Think hard.
Your freedom depends on it.

26
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:40,409
What about guns?
You got any guns in the house?

27
00:07:43,005 --> 00:07:44,499
Here's your story.

28
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:48,249
You woke up. You found her.
That's all you know.

29
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:50,344
Say it.

30
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:55,932
Say it, please. "I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know."

31
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:01,934
Say it. "I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know."

32
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,023
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

33
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:05,564
Again.

34
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:08,402
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

35
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:10,191
Again. Again.

36
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:13,361
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

37
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:16,946
I woke up. I found her.
That's all I know.

38
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:24,252
Once you call,
the people who show up...

39
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:27,036
...will be with
the Office of Medical investigations.

40
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:29,629
That's primarily who you'll talk to.

41
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:32,132
Police officers may arrive,
they may not.

42
00:08:32,346 --> 00:08:34,422
Depends on how busy
a morning they're having.

43
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,131
Typically, ODs are not
a high-priority call.

44
00:08:37,893 --> 00:08:39,601
There's nothing to incriminate you...

45
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:42,137
...so I'd be amazed
if you got placed under arrest.

46
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:47,768
However, if you do, you say nothing.

47
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,109
You tell them
you just want your lawyer.

48
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:52,528
Then you call Saul Goodman.

49
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,155
And do I need to state the obvious?

50
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:00,279
I was not here.

51
00:09:10,551 --> 00:09:12,128
You put on a long-sleeved shirt...

52
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:14,253
...and cover
those track marks on your arm.

53
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:21,594
Count down from 20,
and then you dial.

54
00:09:33,907 --> 00:09:37,407
Hang tough.
You're in the home stretch.

55
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:06,142
Do you want 2-percent or skim?

56
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:10,224
- Two.
- Two. All right.

57
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,614
Thank you.

58
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:20,076
Junior.

59
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,286
Junior.

60
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:30,285
- Flynn.
- What?

61
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:32,924
Flynn.

62
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,885
Flynn.

63
00:10:37,221 --> 00:10:39,593
I'll be there in a minute.

64
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,436
You all right?

65
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:54,818
Flynn, get your butt in here.

66
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:58,858
Oh, my God. Mom, Dad, come here.
You gotta see this.

67
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:01,068
Seriously.

68
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:08,457
- What?
- Look right there. Look at that.

69
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:12,084
Are those donations?

70
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:13,957
- Yes.
- Actual donations for your dad?

71
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:21,756
Total strangers gave us $490.

72
00:11:21,974 --> 00:11:26,801
Twenty-six people.
Virginia, Minnesota, Montana.

73
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,472
Look at this one. Vancouver.
All the way up in Canada.

74
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:34,061
And it's all real, actual money.

75
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:38,402
It's actually right there
in the PayPal account.

76
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,487
And look what they're saying.

77
00:11:42,703 --> 00:11:46,997
"Hang in there, Walt." "Good luck."
"Hang in there."

78
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,123
Isn't this awesome?

79
00:11:52,212 --> 00:11:56,625
That's... Wow, that is something.

80
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:01,304
Walt, don't you think
a little thank-you is in order?

81
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:05,597
Yes, absolutely. Thank you, son.

82
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:09,012
Thank you. This is a big, big help.

83
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:15,563
Oh, look, 20 more bucks
from Thunder Bay, Ontario.

84
00:12:15,777 --> 00:12:20,772
Damn. Five hundred and ten dollars.

85
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:32,416
If you're trying to sell me something,
I've got four words for you:

86
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:33,623
"Do-not-call list."

87
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:36,624
However, if you're cool,
leave it at the beep.

88
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,462
How did I know you wouldn't be
answering your phone?

89
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,716
I'm on my way.
I'm gonna be there momentarily.

90
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:47,515
I expect you on the porch, bag packed,
ready to go. No excuses.

91
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:34,846
Sir, you may not wanna
be here for this.

92
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:58,751
I just woke up and I found her.

93
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:00,791
That's all I know.

94
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,299
What's her date of birth?

95
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:13,134
Sir, your daughter's date of birth?

96
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:15,563
April...

97
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:19,640
- April 4th, 1982.
- Okay.

98
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:24,523
And mother's maiden name
and place of birth.

99
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:28,075
- My mother?
- Your daughter's mother.

100
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:30,905
Bishop.

101
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:35,914
- And place of birth?
- Phoenix.

102
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:38,873
Phoenix, Arizona?

103
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:44,796
This is our address.

104
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,260
Do you have someone
who can drive you?

105
00:14:47,471 --> 00:14:48,882
I can drive.

106
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:51,055
Well, then if you'd like
to meet us there...

107
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:53,674
...we can complete the intake
and take our samples...

108
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:56,183
...and then you can make
your arrangements.

109
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:57,725
Okay?

110
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:01,474
Now, do you need a card?
Will you both be coming?

111
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:29,044
I don't believe it.
Walt, you have to see this.

112
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:31,255
- Forty from Te...
- Terre Haute.

113
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:32,469
Walt.

114
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:43,980
It's me.

115
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:46,317
Are you there? Hello.

116
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,781
I'm just checking in.

117
00:15:51,368 --> 00:15:55,318
Our friend says
he thinks everything went well.

118
00:15:55,539 --> 00:15:57,864
That's... That's good.

119
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:02,247
So listen. Just call me, all right?

120
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:07,421
Hey, Walt, you've gotta come in here.
We just broke a thousand dollars.

121
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:13,341
All right. I'm coming.

122
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:17,767
Some of you already know
my brother-in-law. He's a good man.

123
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:20,932
The doctors say this operation
has a real chance of helping him.

124
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:25,395
They're also saying they wanna
be paid in private islands, so dig deep.

125
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:27,689
Biggest donation...

126
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:30,740
...gets a six-pack
of my very own Schraderbrau.

127
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:33,449
Home-brewed to silky perfection.

128
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,487
Smallest donation
gets two six-packs.

129
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:38,824
All right. Other than Gomie here
pees sitting down...

130
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,072
...here's what we know.

131
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:42,664
Christian Ortega, a.k.a. Combo.

132
00:16:42,878 --> 00:16:45,451
Shot dead
by an unknown assailant last month.

133
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,297
"Combo?" I hear you say.

134
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:51,459
"Why, I'm unfamiliar with that name.
Was he a Nobel laureate perchance?"

135
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:54,300
No. He was a dipshit
wannabe banger.

136
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:57,052
Now, no arrests,
save for stealing a baby Jesus...

137
00:16:57,267 --> 00:16:59,841
...from a Knights of Columbus manger
back when he was 17.

138
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:04,012
This dude was so low-rep,
he never showed up on our radar.

139
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:06,066
So why am I talking about him?

140
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:09,696
Anyone? Anyone?

141
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:10,901
Bueller?

142
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:13,322
- He was dealing Blue Sky.
- That's right.

143
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:16,321
Now, how is it that the purest,
most professional grade...

144
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:21,163
...of meth we've ever come across
is being slung by the likes of that?

145
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:22,833
But wait. It gets better.

146
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:26,163
Since baby-Jesus thief there
slowed a bullet with his neck...

147
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,419
...the blue stuff's
vanished from town, okay?

148
00:17:28,632 --> 00:17:31,549
Not a speck to be found
in Albuquerque. Now, why is that?

149
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:37,132
Well, because maybe
your Heisenberg's in prison.

150
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:40,430
So says A.P.D.
They think they got their man.

151
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:43,052
I know you don't buy it,
but maybe it's true.

152
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:48,977
James Edward Kilkelly, yeah.
A.P.D. thinks this is our mastermind.

153
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:51,187
You believe that,
I got a bridge to sell you.

154
00:17:51,405 --> 00:17:54,026
- He copped to it, didn't he?
- For an extra pudding cup...

155
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:55,569
...every night at Los Lunas?

156
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:57,860
Maybe if you give him
a pack of cigarettes...

157
00:17:58,078 --> 00:18:01,328
...he'll tell you what
he did with Jimmy Hoffa. No, no, no.

158
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,820
I've been thinking.

159
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:07,538
Top-shelf product like this?
It doesn't fall off the face of the earth.

160
00:18:07,754 --> 00:18:09,664
Raw talent's bound
to pop up somewhere.

161
00:18:09,882 --> 00:18:12,551
It's like Whack-A-Mole.
So I've been making phone calls.

162
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:16,128
Local police departments,
small-town sheriffs.

163
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:19,505
Haven't had much luck
inside the Land of Enchantment.

164
00:18:19,725 --> 00:18:22,263
But outside,
I've got reports of the blue stuff...

165
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:25,478
...making a scene here in Texas,
Arizona, Colorado and Nevada.

166
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:29,817
In fact, everywhere but here.

167
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,939
Almost as if somebody wised up,
stopped shitting where they eat.

168
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:37,491
Now...

169
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:40,906
...I say Heisenberg's still out there.

170
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:44,071
I say he's gone regional.

171
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,497
Only he's still right here in town.

172
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:50,415
Come on, 2800.

173
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:53,916
Come on, big 28. You can do it.

174
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:56,756
Only 30 more dollars. Thirty more.

175
00:18:57,721 --> 00:19:00,592
Fo... Forty dollars! Twenty-eight ten.

176
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,266
- Yes!
- Yes!

177
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:07,059
Who's gonna be next?

178
00:19:07,272 --> 00:19:09,064
Your guy found him?

179
00:19:09,566 --> 00:19:11,310
Where is he?

180
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:12,522
Okay, listen.

181
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:14,230
No, no, I don't care.

182
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:16,071
You have your guy pick...

183
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:18,274
Saul. Just shut... Saul.

184
00:19:18,492 --> 00:19:21,777
Saul, shut up
and give me the address.

185
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,576
I don't recommend it.

186
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,917
A.P.D.'s been known
to sit on this place...

187
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:32,798
...keep an eye
on the comings and goings.

188
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:34,882
Are they here now?

189
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:38,959
Well, I don't see any sign,
but that's the point.

190
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:42,261
Police could be the least of it.

191
00:19:42,474 --> 00:19:44,431
You could just get mugged or shot.

192
00:19:46,812 --> 00:19:49,813
How about you go on home, Walter?

193
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:52,016
Let me handle this.

194
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:23,258
Yo.

195
00:21:22,491 --> 00:21:24,199
Jesse.

196
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:30,279
Jesse. Jesse. Look at me, son.

197
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:33,416
- Wake up. Wake up.
- Hey.

198
00:21:33,627 --> 00:21:37,292
I ain't got nothing for you, man.
It's all gone.

199
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:39,498
Jesse, damn it, wake up. Just...

200
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:42,967
Jesse, Jesse. Jesse, it's me.
Okay, it's me. It's Walt. It's Walt.

201
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:44,293
Jesse.

202
00:21:44,513 --> 00:21:47,182
- Yeah.
- Come on, let's get out of here.

203
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:51,009
No, no, no.

204
00:21:51,228 --> 00:21:53,221
- I'm good.
- Come on. Help me out now.

205
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:56,772
I'm good. I'm good.
Right here, man. Right here.

206
00:21:56,984 --> 00:22:00,150
Listen, Jesse, you are not good
right here.

207
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:02,520
You are not good at all. You hear?

208
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:06,407
Now, you just put your arms
around me. Come on.

209
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:07,994
You're gonna stand up...

210
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:10,659
...and we're gonna
walk out of here, okay?

211
00:22:10,873 --> 00:22:12,912
We're gonna take you
someplace nice and safe.

212
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:16,375
That's it. Now, let's go.
Come on. Here we go.

213
00:22:44,323 --> 00:22:46,315
I killed her.

214
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:49,570
- What?
- I killed her. It was me.

215
00:22:49,786 --> 00:22:51,411
- I killed her, man. I killed her.
- No.

216
00:22:51,622 --> 00:22:54,741
Jesse, look at me. Look at me.

217
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:56,369
You didn't kill anybody.

218
00:22:57,753 --> 00:23:00,041
I loved her.

219
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:06,380
I loved her more than anything.

220
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:20,522
No, no. No.

221
00:24:09,575 --> 00:24:11,651
I haven't given much thought
to the programs.

222
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:14,075
I guess they should be...

223
00:24:15,247 --> 00:24:18,830
I don't know.
Just use your best judgment.

224
00:24:20,169 --> 00:24:22,457
There's no yellow dress here.

225
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:26,289
It's all... It's all black and gray.

226
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:30,970
When's the last time you saw her
ever wearing a yellow dress?

227
00:24:32,764 --> 00:24:34,804
What about blue?

228
00:24:35,017 --> 00:24:38,302
Blue's better than black, right?

229
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:42,140
No, no. Not dark blue. More like...

230
00:24:42,357 --> 00:24:46,355
Not super-bright, either.

231
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:48,230
I mean, blue is blue.

232
00:24:48,447 --> 00:24:52,030
No. No cleavage.

233
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:55,319
Long sleeves.

234
00:24:56,914 --> 00:24:59,784
Yeah. It's nice.

235
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,037
It's nice.

236
00:25:08,717 --> 00:25:10,544
Big yawn, Holly.

237
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:13,762
I know what you feel like.
I'm tired too.

238
00:25:16,058 --> 00:25:18,845
- Okay, sweetie.
- Yes.

239
00:25:21,313 --> 00:25:22,772
Yes!

240
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:25,437
Here we go.

241
00:25:25,651 --> 00:25:29,269
Here we go. Yes.

242
00:25:35,327 --> 00:25:38,696
Would you mind
turning that thing down or off?

243
00:25:39,248 --> 00:25:41,573
Junior. Hey.

244
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:45,497
The dinging.
Just turn down the volume.

245
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:50,339
- Dad, it's money.
- Just please do it.

246
00:25:50,551 --> 00:25:53,042
Okay, the noise
is disturbing the baby.

247
00:25:55,848 --> 00:25:57,840
Marie, slow down. I can't...

248
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:03,019
Oh, my God. You are kidding me.

249
00:26:03,522 --> 00:26:06,725
Sure. Of course.
Any day after school.

250
00:26:06,942 --> 00:26:10,726
Okay. Wait. I'm gonna... Let me tell him,
and I'll call you right back.

251
00:26:10,946 --> 00:26:12,321
Okay.

252
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:15,657
- Guess what.
- What?

253
00:26:15,868 --> 00:26:18,359
- You are gonna be in the newspaper.
- No way.

254
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:20,571
One of Marie's patients
works at the Journal.

255
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:23,078
She told him about the website
and the donations...

256
00:26:23,292 --> 00:26:25,617
...and they're gonna do a story
about you.

257
00:26:25,836 --> 00:26:26,832
- For real?
- Yep.

258
00:26:27,045 --> 00:26:30,046
They're coming to interview you
with a photo and everything.

259
00:26:30,257 --> 00:26:31,835
Awesome.

260
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:36,629
- It'll mean more hits.
- And more contributions.

261
00:26:41,435 --> 00:26:43,344
East of Scottsdale?

262
00:26:43,562 --> 00:26:45,970
Let me guess. Not talking.

263
00:26:46,857 --> 00:26:48,648
Nope. Not a one.

264
00:26:48,859 --> 00:26:51,776
Someone somewhere
is running one tight ship.

265
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:56,522
All right, chief. Yeah. Thanks a lot.

266
00:26:56,742 --> 00:26:58,485
Yeah. You too.

267
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:04,164
Agent Schrader,
can you spare a moment?

268
00:27:04,374 --> 00:27:06,533
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

269
00:27:09,505 --> 00:27:12,375
Gentlemen, this is
Supervising Agent Hank Schrader.

270
00:27:12,883 --> 00:27:16,667
Agent Schrader, I'd like you to meet
Andrew Coffman of the Adobe Hotel.

271
00:27:16,887 --> 00:27:18,630
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

272
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:20,923
Paul Canterna
of Canterna Real Estate.

273
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:22,968
- Hey, it's a pleasure.
- Good to meet you.

274
00:27:23,185 --> 00:27:26,684
And Gustavo Fring
of Los Pollos Hermanos.

275
00:27:26,897 --> 00:27:28,973
- Please, just Gus.
- Hi, Gus.

276
00:27:29,191 --> 00:27:30,982
You guys make some killer chicken.

277
00:27:31,777 --> 00:27:32,773
Thank you very much.

278
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:35,477
These gentlemen are underwriting
this year's Fun Run...

279
00:27:35,697 --> 00:27:37,524
...and I thought
I would give them a tour.

280
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:40,314
Absolutely. Get to see
what you're supporting. Thank you.

281
00:27:40,536 --> 00:27:42,612
Can you tell us a little
about your work here?

282
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:44,324
Yes, the Albuquerque office...

283
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:47,161
...covers everything
from drug-related money laundering...

284
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:50,127
...to interdiction of illicit substances
crossing the border.

285
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:54,128
Now, the group that I supervise
focuses on methamphetamine...

286
00:27:54,341 --> 00:27:57,342
...which is a growing problem
in the country, unfortunately.

287
00:27:57,553 --> 00:27:59,878
- Terrible.
- Yeah. It is indeed.

288
00:28:00,097 --> 00:28:01,674
We've had
some successes locally...

289
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,966
...but overall,
the supply seems to be growing.

290
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:07,767
I gotta tell you, community outreach,
like this Fun Run...

291
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,138
...one of the most powerful
weapons we have.

292
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:11,555
Anything we can do.

293
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:13,186
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Hank.

294
00:28:13,402 --> 00:28:14,516
- Gentlemen.
- Thanks.

295
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:16,396
Sure. Thank you.

296
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:19,072
Is this one of your agents?

297
00:28:19,283 --> 00:28:23,232
Oh, yeah, no, no,
that's my brother-in-law.

298
00:28:23,453 --> 00:28:25,411
He's got a health issue.
We're trying to...

299
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:29,038
Oh, I'm very sorry.
What sort of health issue?

300
00:28:30,085 --> 00:28:33,869
- Lung cancer.
- Oh, that's a rough one.

301
00:28:34,715 --> 00:28:39,840
- Oh, hey, you don't have to do that.
- Please. Please. I'm happy to do it.

302
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,638
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

303
00:29:02,451 --> 00:29:05,950
Just so you know,
I won't be back for a while.

304
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:09,742
I'm gonna have
my surgery on Friday.

305
00:29:12,336 --> 00:29:14,743
I'm hopeful it'll go well.

306
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:19,752
But if not,
Saul will take care of things.

307
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:23,172
He's got your money.
He's keeping it for you.

308
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:38,814
Look, Jesse, lingering on things
doesn't help, believe me.

309
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:43,241
Just try and focus
on getting better, okay.

310
00:29:44,243 --> 00:29:46,282
I deserve this.

311
00:29:47,287 --> 00:29:48,746
What?

312
00:29:50,666 --> 00:29:53,620
What you said in the desert.

313
00:29:53,836 --> 00:29:57,536
I get it, what you meant.

314
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,132
I deserve whatever happens.

315
00:30:24,533 --> 00:30:26,525
Oh, shit.

316
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,710
There he is!

317
00:30:44,469 --> 00:30:47,589
Walt, they're doing a feature
on Walter Jr.

318
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:50,178
We called you about 50 times.

319
00:30:50,392 --> 00:30:53,761
Marie, I thought we were just talking
about a newspaper story.

320
00:30:53,979 --> 00:30:57,395
I know. But I thought, you know,
if it's good enough for the Journal...

321
00:30:57,608 --> 00:31:01,142
...then why not TV? So I went for it.

322
00:31:02,529 --> 00:31:03,810
- This is him?
- Yes.

323
00:31:04,031 --> 00:31:05,406
This is Dad. Great.

324
00:31:05,616 --> 00:31:08,866
Let's get everyone on the couch.
I'm thinking Walt Jr. in the middle...

325
00:31:09,077 --> 00:31:10,987
...Mom and Dad on either side.

326
00:31:11,205 --> 00:31:12,615
Mom and Dad?

327
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:17,453
How much money
have you raised so far?

328
00:31:18,003 --> 00:31:21,704
Six thousand, three hundred
and sixty dollars.

329
00:31:21,924 --> 00:31:23,963
But there's more coming in
all the time.

330
00:31:24,176 --> 00:31:27,011
- Wow, that's amazing.
- We don't even know what to say.

331
00:31:27,221 --> 00:31:30,672
It's just... It's been incredible.

332
00:31:30,891 --> 00:31:33,097
Judging from things you have
written about him...

333
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:39,016
- ...your dad must be quite a guy.
- Yeah. He is. He's the best.

334
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:41,688
You don't wanna lose him,
do you, Walter?

335
00:31:41,902 --> 00:31:46,065
None of us do. We love him.

336
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:51,028
- He's a good man, isn't he?
- Absolutely. Ask anyone.

337
00:31:51,995 --> 00:31:55,115
Anybody. He's a great father,
a great teacher.

338
00:31:55,332 --> 00:31:57,905
He knows everything there is
to know about chemistry.

339
00:31:58,502 --> 00:32:02,416
He's patient with you,
and he's always there for you.

340
00:32:02,631 --> 00:32:07,092
He's just decent.

341
00:32:07,302 --> 00:32:10,754
And he always does the right thing.

342
00:32:10,973 --> 00:32:14,424
And that's how he teaches me to be.

343
00:32:14,643 --> 00:32:19,435
- Would you say he's your hero?
- Oh, yeah. Yes, ma'am. Totally.

344
00:32:19,648 --> 00:32:22,269
My dad is my hero.

345
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:32,325
Does that put him to sleep?

346
00:32:33,245 --> 00:32:34,988
This one just relaxes him a little.

347
00:32:35,205 --> 00:32:37,957
We're almost ready.
We'll be taking you in, in just a minute.

348
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:39,791
Okay. Thank you.

349
00:32:43,714 --> 00:32:44,959
Well...

350
00:32:46,758 --> 00:32:50,092
- Here we are.
- Yeah.

351
00:33:09,281 --> 00:33:12,198
Relaxed yet?

352
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:14,532
As a matter of fact...

353
00:33:18,457 --> 00:33:23,285
I don't know what this stuff is,
but it's pretty great.

354
00:33:25,297 --> 00:33:26,756
Yeah, it looks like it.

355
00:33:29,593 --> 00:33:31,669
We'll be here when you wake up.

356
00:33:32,638 --> 00:33:35,307
Well, I'll be looking for you.

357
00:33:35,516 --> 00:33:38,185
They'll probably want me
to take your glasses.

358
00:33:38,393 --> 00:33:40,101
Yeah, you better.

359
00:33:40,771 --> 00:33:44,638
Yeah, okay. Okay. I got them.

360
00:33:46,235 --> 00:33:48,192
Where's your phone?

361
00:33:48,403 --> 00:33:50,610
Your cell phone. Did you bring it?

362
00:33:50,822 --> 00:33:52,530
Which one?

363
00:33:56,036 --> 00:34:01,243
I'm pretty sure
he didn't bring it, Mom.

364
00:34:03,836 --> 00:34:05,211
Okay.

365
00:35:22,456 --> 00:35:23,915
Well, first things first.

366
00:35:24,124 --> 00:35:26,449
How old is that baby now?
When do I get to meet her?

367
00:35:26,668 --> 00:35:29,622
I was actually thinking
of bringing her today, but...

368
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:32,045
She's 7 weeks tomorrow.

369
00:35:32,257 --> 00:35:33,253
- Seven, right?
- Yeah.

370
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:37,963
Yeah, oh, hey, I have a picture...

371
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,007
...here somewhere.

372
00:35:41,558 --> 00:35:43,847
- She's beautiful.
- Thanks.

373
00:35:44,061 --> 00:35:46,766
Always a relief to say that
and actually mean it.

374
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:51,773
- How's your pain level, Walter?
- It's...

375
00:35:51,985 --> 00:35:53,978
Very low, basically.

376
00:35:54,196 --> 00:35:56,070
Shortness of breath?

377
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:59,033
- A bit, but much better.
- Good.

378
00:36:00,202 --> 00:36:01,945
Well, your margins look good.

379
00:36:02,162 --> 00:36:03,656
I can't foresee the future...

380
00:36:03,872 --> 00:36:05,664
...but even
conservatively speaking...

381
00:36:05,874 --> 00:36:08,496
...I can say that you bought yourself
some real time here.

382
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:12,077
There's no reason
not to be optimistic.

383
00:36:12,297 --> 00:36:14,089
That's great.

384
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:17,883
That is great. Thank you, doctor.

385
00:36:19,263 --> 00:36:22,679
So when could he get back
to his normal routine?

386
00:36:22,891 --> 00:36:25,216
- He can ease into it now.
- Okay.

387
00:36:25,435 --> 00:36:30,856
- And can he go back to work or...?
- I'd give it a few more weeks.

388
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:35,232
Make sure you avoid any heavy lifting
and continue to get plenty of rest.

389
00:36:35,445 --> 00:36:38,019
But he can be on his own?

390
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,490
I mean, just more,
you know, independent.

391
00:36:41,952 --> 00:36:44,490
Yes. Use your best judgment.

392
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:46,611
Well...

393
00:36:46,832 --> 00:36:49,405
Now, that's good news
for you, huh, honey?

394
00:36:49,626 --> 00:36:51,915
One less baby in the house.

395
00:37:03,307 --> 00:37:05,465
- Don, hey.
- Hey, Stew.

396
00:37:05,684 --> 00:37:08,140
Hey, welcome back.

397
00:37:08,353 --> 00:37:10,311
Thanks. It's good to be back.

398
00:37:12,441 --> 00:37:16,901
Jesus. We were all so sorry to hear.

399
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,854
Yes. Thanks.

400
00:37:20,199 --> 00:37:22,275
Terrible thing. Just...

401
00:37:23,035 --> 00:37:26,201
But, you know, we've all been
thinking about you, and...

402
00:37:26,413 --> 00:37:29,082
- You been doing okay?
- I'm doing okay.

403
00:37:29,499 --> 00:37:32,999
After a certain point,
time off doesn't help...

404
00:37:33,212 --> 00:37:36,746
...so I figured I'd rather be here.

405
00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:41,249
- Focus on work.
- Sure. Absolutely.

406
00:37:41,887 --> 00:37:43,215
Yeah.

407
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:46,213
Well, see you inside.

408
00:37:47,768 --> 00:37:51,219
Continue to descend through 1500.

409
00:37:51,438 --> 00:37:54,439
Headed downwind for a left base
on Runway 17.

410
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:58,398
Number 26-Tango,
descend to maintain 13,000.

411
00:37:58,612 --> 00:38:02,360
Truth or Consequences altimeter,
two-niner-niner-eight.

412
00:38:02,574 --> 00:38:07,450
Pima 311, contact
Albuquerque Center 134.6.

413
00:38:07,663 --> 00:38:11,162
Juliet-5-Bravo, ident, say altitude.

414
00:38:11,834 --> 00:38:15,997
Juliet-5-Bravo, roger.
Clear direct to Winslow.

415
00:38:16,213 --> 00:38:18,786
I think I may just keep this.

416
00:38:19,049 --> 00:38:20,080
Sky?

417
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,254
What do you think?

418
00:38:25,097 --> 00:38:27,136
Doesn't look so bad, right?

419
00:38:29,434 --> 00:38:30,633
What are you doing?

420
00:38:30,853 --> 00:38:33,390
I'm going to Hank and Marie's
for the weekend.

421
00:38:35,607 --> 00:38:37,481
- Since when?
- I'm taking the baby with me.

422
00:38:37,693 --> 00:38:39,602
Marie will pick up
Walter Jr. from school.

423
00:38:40,362 --> 00:38:43,233
You'll have the house to yourself
for two days.

424
00:38:43,866 --> 00:38:46,403
I want you to pack your things
and leave.

425
00:38:47,369 --> 00:38:48,614
Why would I do that?

426
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:51,996
Hank has offered to help. You shouldn't
be doing any heavy lifting.

427
00:38:52,207 --> 00:38:54,663
- Skyler.
- I want you gone by Monday morning.

428
00:38:54,877 --> 00:38:56,287
I want...

429
00:38:56,712 --> 00:38:57,910
I want you gone.

430
00:39:07,723 --> 00:39:11,637
Okay. Can you at least tell me why?

431
00:39:12,644 --> 00:39:14,970
Because you're a liar, Walt.

432
00:39:17,149 --> 00:39:18,809
Two cell phones, after all.

433
00:39:20,277 --> 00:39:21,273
What?

434
00:39:21,486 --> 00:39:24,440
Before your surgery, I asked
if you had packed your cell phone...

435
00:39:24,656 --> 00:39:28,524
...and you said, "Which one?"

436
00:39:29,786 --> 00:39:30,985
When?

437
00:39:31,205 --> 00:39:33,742
Skyler, I was medicated.

438
00:39:33,957 --> 00:39:36,116
I mean, I could have said
the world was flat.

439
00:39:36,335 --> 00:39:37,330
You know what I think?

440
00:39:39,254 --> 00:39:42,421
I think you accidentally
told the truth.

441
00:39:42,799 --> 00:39:45,504
Honey, we have been over this.

442
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:47,676
Asked and answered, right?

443
00:39:47,888 --> 00:39:50,805
Then it got me thinking again...

444
00:39:51,016 --> 00:39:54,599
...about all the strange behaviour.

445
00:39:54,811 --> 00:39:57,267
Not the least of which
was the disappearance.

446
00:39:57,481 --> 00:39:59,936
Out of my mind with worry,
calling hospitals...

447
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:02,059
...checking the morgue.

448
00:40:02,903 --> 00:40:05,061
Your fugue state?

449
00:40:07,658 --> 00:40:10,231
I had to believe that, didn't I?

450
00:40:10,744 --> 00:40:13,200
I had to find a way.

451
00:40:14,164 --> 00:40:19,075
I mean, who would lie
about such a thing?

452
00:40:19,795 --> 00:40:21,075
You tell me, Skyler.

453
00:40:21,296 --> 00:40:24,381
You tell me exactly what it is
you think I'm lying about.

454
00:40:24,883 --> 00:40:27,754
What? I'm having an affair.
Is that what you think?

455
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:30,176
Yeah. For the last few weeks.

456
00:40:30,389 --> 00:40:33,058
With whom?
Who am I having an affair with?

457
00:40:33,267 --> 00:40:35,639
Well, my guess
was Gretchen Schwartz.

458
00:40:36,436 --> 00:40:40,185
Something was going on between you.
I just knew.

459
00:40:40,399 --> 00:40:43,934
Jesus. Skyler. Get me a Bible
to swear on, if that's what it takes.

460
00:40:44,152 --> 00:40:45,944
I am not having an affair
with Gretchen.

461
00:40:46,154 --> 00:40:49,191
I know. I know you're not.
Because I asked her.

462
00:40:52,995 --> 00:40:55,283
It really took me forever
to get in touch with her.

463
00:40:55,497 --> 00:40:57,406
She was ducking my calls for weeks.

464
00:40:58,375 --> 00:40:59,786
So I finally left a message:

465
00:41:00,002 --> 00:41:03,834
"What exactly is going on
between you and my husband?"

466
00:41:04,047 --> 00:41:06,455
I thought that'd get her attention,
and it did.

467
00:41:06,675 --> 00:41:10,258
So she called me back,
and she finally told me.

468
00:41:11,763 --> 00:41:14,136
The money for your treatment...

469
00:41:15,434 --> 00:41:19,348
...Gretchen and Elliott
didn't give you a dime.

470
00:41:21,023 --> 00:41:22,766
They paid for nothing.

471
00:41:22,983 --> 00:41:25,391
You refused every offer
they made you.

472
00:41:25,611 --> 00:41:26,891
But that didn't make sense...

473
00:41:27,112 --> 00:41:29,568
...because I checked with Delcavoli
and the hospital...

474
00:41:29,781 --> 00:41:33,067
...and not including your surgery...

475
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:35,278
...we're nearly paid up.

476
00:41:35,621 --> 00:41:38,325
Over $100,000.

477
00:41:39,791 --> 00:41:44,169
Out of where? Out of thin air?

478
00:41:52,638 --> 00:41:54,381
But then...

479
00:41:55,849 --> 00:41:58,056
...I called your mother.

480
00:42:00,145 --> 00:42:01,687
Yeah.

481
00:42:02,731 --> 00:42:04,558
Thanks for that too.

482
00:42:05,234 --> 00:42:07,559
But I thought, you know,
maybe she has some money...

483
00:42:07,778 --> 00:42:11,858
...that I don't know about.
Maybe she contributed.

484
00:42:13,242 --> 00:42:15,115
It's possible.

485
00:42:17,287 --> 00:42:21,748
It turns out that not only is the money
not from your mother...

486
00:42:21,959 --> 00:42:27,000
...she didn't even know
that you have cancer.

487
00:42:30,259 --> 00:42:32,547
You never went to see her.

488
00:42:34,221 --> 00:42:36,297
I dropped you at the airport.
I picked you up.

489
00:42:36,515 --> 00:42:37,926
You were gone for four days...

490
00:42:38,141 --> 00:42:41,925
...and yet she swears...

491
00:42:42,479 --> 00:42:44,768
...that you were never there.

492
00:42:49,528 --> 00:42:53,857
Lies on top of lies on top of lies.

493
00:42:55,784 --> 00:42:56,780
Skyler.

494
00:42:57,870 --> 00:42:59,661
Could you...

495
00:43:00,622 --> 00:43:02,579
...just once...

496
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:09,161
...do me the courtesy
of not denying it?

497
00:43:18,348 --> 00:43:19,926
Skyler.

498
00:43:21,602 --> 00:43:23,262
Skyler, don't do this, please.

499
00:43:23,478 --> 00:43:25,720
I...

500
00:43:26,315 --> 00:43:28,853
Skyler, please don't go.

501
00:43:37,701 --> 00:43:42,410
If I tell you the truth, will you stay?

502
00:43:44,499 --> 00:43:47,335
Stay, and I will tell you everything.

503
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:50,497
Whatever it is...

504
00:43:51,632 --> 00:43:53,589
...I'm afraid to know.

505
00:44:21,870 --> 00:44:24,077
Wayfarer-515, radio check.

506
00:44:25,165 --> 00:44:27,205

Aircraft calling, please stand by.

00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:49,355
Jane-Mike-21, turn, heading...
Disregard.

514
00:44:50,232 --> 00:44:52,438

518
00:45:03,412 --> 00:45:05,535

Contact Albuquerque Center, 134.6.

523
00:45:20,846 --> 00:45:24,013
Wayfarer-515, descend to 10,000.

524
00:45:24,224 --> 00:45:26,846
Juliet-Mike-21, do you have that traffic
at your 9 o'clock?
