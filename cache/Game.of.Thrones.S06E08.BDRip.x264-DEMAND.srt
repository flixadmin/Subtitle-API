1
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,485
My son.

2
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,445
My firstborn son.

3
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,243
My child king, hush.

4
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,690
Listen to the gods,
for you they sing.

5
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,928
Fight no more, sweet child.
Your wars are won.

6
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,569
The wolves are buried

7
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,006
and the false stag done.

8
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,685
Shut your blue eyes, my love.

9
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,570
Let the crown fall.
The Father above beckons you to his hall.

10
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,324
In seventh heaven
I'll see you once more.

11
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,326
But now I seek vengeance
on Sansa the whore

12
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,969
and my brother the Imp

13
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,843
who killed his own king.

14
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,562
Born amongst lions, our curse from within.
I will slay him, I swear.

15
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,487
With noose or with knife,

16
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,322
though it take me a fortnight,

17
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,523
a moon or my life.

18
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,411
What is that I hear and smell?

19
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,245
Someone I'll soon send to hell.

20
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,005
It's time to see
if truth they told

21
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,408
who said Tywin Lannister
shits gold.

22
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,811
Get the wig!

23
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,646
You beast, you beast.
You killed my wife.

24
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,291
And now you've taken
your father's life.

25
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,089
No worse child ever stained
this land.

26
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,642
I curse the day I named you.

27
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,489
My greatest crime!

28
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,041
You're good at that.

29
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,884
Where did you learn?

30
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,366
I'm a jealous woman.

31
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,880
I've always liked bad men
and they've always liked me.

32
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,725
They'd come home,
wherever home was that night,

33
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,644
stinking of some whore's perfume.

34
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,805
So we'd fight
and I'd put a hole in them.

35
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,530
And then I'd feel terrible,

36
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,240
so I'd patch them up.

37
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,245
I got good at patching them up.

38
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,129
And good at putting holes in them.

39
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,770
And that.

40
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,408
What happened to the actress?

41
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,323
The one who wanted you dead.

42
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,410
Bianca.

43
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,842
She'll have a hard time
finding work as an actress

44
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,922
after what I did to her face.

45
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,090
I never did learn to cook.

46
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,241
But eat. Eat, you need it.

47
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,445
The company is moving on
to Pentos soon.

48
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,931
You should come with us.

49
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,207
- I can't.
- Why not?

50
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,248
Got a feeling you'd be good
at this sort of work.

51
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,882
And besides,
we need a new actress.

52
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,606
I don't think I could
remember all the lines.

53
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,650
Come with us.

54
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,130
What's left for you here?

55
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,364
You wouldn't be safe.

56
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,289
Not while she's looking for me.

57
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,531
Who?

58
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,891
She doesn't have a name.

59
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,081
Where will you go?

60
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,964
Essos is east and Westeros is west.

61
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,529
But what's west of Westeros?

62
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,041
I don't know.

63
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,605
Nobody does.

64
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,969
That's where all the maps stop.

65
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,048
The edge of the world, maybe.

66
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,326
I'd like to see that.

67
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,402
- What's that?
- Milk of the poppy.

68
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,126
I don't want any.

69
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,647
Sleep is the only way you'll heal.

70
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,202
Trust me, if my soup didn't kill you,
nothing will.

71
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,043
Thing about Gatins, right,
is he used to be pretty.

72
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,565
I was a famous kisser.

73
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,089
You lads know how to kiss proper?

74
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,401
Course we do.

75
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,370
This is for masters, this technique.

76
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,885
- You're not ready.
- I'm ready.

77
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,411
He says he's ready.

78
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,564
All right. Now, pay attention.

79
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,607
You put your left hand
on the back of the lady's head.

80
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,969
Your right hand holds
the small of the lady's back like so.

81
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,844
Very romantic.

82
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,002
You take your middle finger, yeah,

83
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,802
and you jam it right up
her bunghole.

84
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,245
So fucking close!

85
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,008
It smells like pussy to me.

86
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,730
Look at him. You get hard, boy?

87
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,804
Fuck you! Disgusting old twats.

88
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,451
Got off on that, did you,
you old fuck?

89
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,371
Where's the other one?
The one with the yellow cloak.

90
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,561
Fuck you!

91
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,962
Those are your last words, fuck you?
Come on, you can do better.

92
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,446
Cunt!

93
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,844
You're shit at dying, you know that?

94
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,847
From the fire she was reborn
to remake the world.

95
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:40,165
Daenerys is a gift from the Lord of Light
to her children.

96
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,609
If we are steadfast in our love for the
Queen and her faithful advisers,

97
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,685
no man will ever lock us
in chains again.

98
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,002
I'd call that a successful gambit.

99
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,969
- Would you?
- Look around.

100
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:56,327
The city has come back to life.

101
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,084
You made a pact with fanatics.

102
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,202
I did and it worked.

103
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,887
If you shaved your beard with a straight
razor, you'd say the razor worked.

104
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,281
That doesn't mean
it won't cut your throat.

105
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:09,682
Spoken like a man
who has never had to shave.

106
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,129
I'm going to miss you.

107
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,725
I know.

108
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,810
I hope you're right
about this expedition of yours.

109
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,929
If I don't return,
you'll know I was wrong.

110
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,565
We need friends in Westeros.

111
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,491
And we need ships.

112
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,925
Most of all, we need our queen.

113
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,766
She'll come back. She has to.

114
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,411
My heart's been broken
too many times already.

115
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,847
I'll walk the rest of the way myself.

116
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,490
I can't go off on a secret mission

117
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,609
in the company of the most
famous dwarf in the city.

118
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,921
Varys.

119
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,566
The most famous dwarf in the world.

120
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,841
Your Grace, several members
of the Faith Militant

121
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,649
have been permitted entry
to the Red Keep.

122
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,041
Have been permitted?

123
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,202
That's rather a tortured
way of putting it.

124
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,884
They demand to see you, Your Grace.

125
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,840
Who permitted them inside
the Red Keep?

126
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,722
The king is aware of their presence?

127
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,040
He is, Your Grace.

128
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,805
He's currently in his chambers
at prayer.

129
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,641
Your Grace,
His Holiness the High Septon

130
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:10,326
wishes to speak with you
at the Great Sept of Baelor.

131
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:15,088
His Holiness the High Septon
is welcome to see me here in the Red Keep.

132
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,561
Your Grace, this is not a request.

133
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,120
It is a request, Cousin Lancel.

134
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,487
You are asking me for something,
I'm refusing.

135
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,888
The High Septon commands you.

136
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,689
Are you sure you want to refuse him?

137
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,124
He promised me I could stay
in the Red Keep until my trial.

138
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,441
He made no such promises.

139
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:40,364
- If you refuse to come of your own free will...
- Get out.

140
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,926
Move aside, ser.

141
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,051
Order your man to step aside
or there will be violence.

142
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,725
I choose violence.

143
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,243
Please tell His High Holiness
he's always welcome to visit.

144
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,082
Looks like a siege, my lady.

145
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,405
You have a keen military mind, Pod.

146
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,122
My lady. My lady.

147
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,770
Who goes there?

148
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,406
State your business!

149
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,644
My name is Brienne of Tarth.

150
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,327
Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister
I've come to speak with him.

151
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,967
Tell him I have his sword.

152
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,807
Getting a bit old to be
a squire, aren't we?

153
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,611
Podrick fucking Payne.

154
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,126
I thought you'd be dead by now.

155
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,611
Not yet.

156
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,811
Are they in there?

157
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,767
You think they're fucking?

158
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,080
What?

159
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,889
No.

160
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,088
Why not? I'd fuck her.

161
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,600
- You'd fuck her, wouldn't you?
- I'm her squire.

162
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,290
Well, he'd fuck her, that's for sure.

163
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,249
And she'd fuck him, don't you think?

164
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,402
The way she looks at him.

165
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,245
The way all women look at him
is frankly irritating.

166
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,130
I preferred working with the little brother
on that account.

167
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,043
Come on, you're the one
with the magic cock.

168
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,971
You must have shown it
to her by now.

169
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,330
- She's training me to fight.
- Is she?

170
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,724
An hour in the morning, an hour at night.
Every day.

171
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,569
Then how come an old cunt like me
can still sneak up and murder you?

172
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,120
Well, that's a different sort of fighting.

173
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,850
Now, that's the truth, isn't it?

174
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,448
You want to learn that sort of fighting?

175
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,210
All right.

176
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,968
All right,
let's start with your footwork.

177
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,529
Show me your stance.

178
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,451
Now listen to me, Pod.

179
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,568
See how your feet are about
a yard apart?

180
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,127
Lesson number one,
assume everyone wants to hit you.

181
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,249
'Cause they do, Pod.
Everyone wants to hit a fucking squire.

182
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,725
Do it again.

183
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,041
Come on, don't sulk.

184
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,645
I never thought you'd find her.

185
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,165
I just assumed Sansa was dead.

186
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,404
Why would you assume that?

187
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,643
In my experience,
girls like her don't live very long.

188
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,080
I don't think you know
many girls like her.

189
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,171
Well, I'm proud of you.

190
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,764
I am. You fulfilled your oath to
Catelyn Stark against all odds.

191
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,888
Of course,
my sister wants Sansa dead.

192
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,562
The girl is still a suspect
in Joffrey's murder,

193
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:57,201
so there is that complication.

194
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,360
What the hell are you doing here?

195
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,408
I've come for the Blackfish.

196
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,323
You're welcome to have him.

197
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,371
Lady Sansa desires to take her
ancestral seat back from the Boltons

198
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,364
and assume her rightful position
as Lady of Winterfell.

199
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,364
With what army does she plan
on taking Winterfell?

200
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,885
The Tully army.

201
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,769
They're a bit occupied at the moment.

202
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:21,208
I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun
currently defended by the Tully rebels,

203
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,169
so you can see the conundrum.

204
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,447
The Tullys are rebels
because they're fighting for their home?

205
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,648
Riverrun was granted to the Freys
by royal decree.

206
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,406
As a reward for betraying Robb Stark
and slaughtering his family.

207
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,891
Exactly.

208
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,605
We shouldn't argue about politics.

209
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,330
You're a knight, Ser Jaime.

210
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,329
I know there is honor in you.

211
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,408
- I've seen it myself.
- I'm a Lannister.

212
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,403
Don't ask me to betray my own house.

213
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,084
I do no such thing.

214
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,566
Take Riverrun without bloodshed.

215
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,201
Ride south again with your mission complete
and your army intact.

216
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,930
What do you propose?

217
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,321
Allow me to enter Riverrun
under a flag of truce.

218
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,041
Let me try to persuade the Blackfish
to give up the castle.

219
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,248
Why would he abandon
his ancestral home?

220
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,688
Because you'll allow him
to lead the Tully forces safely north.

221
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,524
Have you ever met the Blackfish?

222
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,480
- No.
- He's even more stubborn than you are.

223
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,086
All right.

224
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,367
Try to talk some sense into the old goat.

225
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,807
He won't listen, but his men might.

226
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,121
Not everybody wants to die
for someone else's home.

227
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,643
I need your word.

228
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,649
If I persuade him to abandon the castle,
you'll grant us safe passage north.

229
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,889
You have my word.

230
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,722
You have until nightfall.

231
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,528
You gave it to me for a purpose.

232
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,008
I've achieved that purpose.

233
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,691
It's yours.

234
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,408
It will always be yours.

235
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,844
One last thing, Ser Jaime.

236
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,763
Yes, Lady Brienne?

237
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,649
Should I fail to persuade
the Blackfish to surrender

238
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,249
and if you attack the castle,

239
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,323
honor compels me to fight
for Sansa's kin.

240
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,050
Of course it does.

241
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,921
To fight you.

242
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,246
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.

243
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,048
I've said no
three times already.

244
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,327
I have a signed letter
from your niece Sansa Stark...

245
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,243
I haven't seen her
since she was a child.

246
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,527
I don't know her signature.
I don't know you.

247
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,928
And I will not surrender.
Double the guards tonight.

248
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,602
The Kingslayer wants to try us.

249
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,205
I can feel it.

250
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,364
As I have said, my name is...

251
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,489
Yes, Brienne of Tarth. I know your father.
Good man.

252
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,925
He always spoke highly of you.

253
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,651
And if he were here now,
I'd tell him the same I'm telling you.

254
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:29,406
If you think I'm abandoning my family's
seat on the Kingslayer's word of honor,

255
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,720
you're a bloody fool.

256
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,485
Riverrun cannot stand against
the Lannisters and the Freys.

257
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:37,087
We can stand longer than
your one-handed friend thinks we can.

258
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,527
- He's not my friend.
- No?

259
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,363
Who gave you permission to cross the
siege line and enter the castle?

260
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,250
Who gave you that sword
with the gold lion on the pommel?

261
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,325
Ser Jaime kept his word
to your niece Catelyn Stark.

262
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,449
He sent me to find Sansa,
to help her as Catelyn wanted.

263
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,648
He gave me this sword to protect her.

264
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,131
That is what I have done

265
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,522
and I will continue to do
until the day I die.

266
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,168
She's exactly like her mother.

267
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,604
I don't have enough men
to help her take Winterfell.

268
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,848
You have more than she does.

269
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,605
She wants her home back.
I understand that.

270
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,409
But this is my home.

271
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,488
And if Jaime Lannister wants it,

272
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,450
he can bloody well take it
the way everyone else does.

273
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,409
Find the maester.

274
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,725
We need to get a raven
north to Sansa.

275
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,083
What should I write?

276
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,929
Tell her I failed.

277
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,965
There's to be a royal announcement?

278
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,041
There is.

279
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,690
Why wasn't I informed?

280
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,802
There is to be a royal announcement

281
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,405
in the throne room

282
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,929
at this very moment.

283
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,969
Where are you going?

284
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,043
To stand by my son.

285
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,851
Your place is in the gallery

286
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,491
with the other ladies of the court.

287
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,765
Your Grace...

288
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,241
Lords and ladies,

289
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,167
the Faith and the Crown are the two
pillars that hold up this world.

290
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,683
One collapses, so does the other.

291
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,120
The Father judges us all.

292
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,611
If you break his laws,

293
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,564
you will be punished.

294
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,288
After conferring with
His Holiness the High Septon,

295
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:10,570
we have determined that Loras Tyrell
and Cersei Lannister's trial

296
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,929
will be held in the Great Sept of Baelor on
the first day of the Festival of the Mother.

297
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,646
Furthermore, after much prayer
and reflection,

298
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,084
the Crown has decided
that from this day forward,

299
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:33,369
trial by combat will be forbidden
throughout the Seven Kingdoms.

300
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,487
The tradition is a brutish one,

301
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,483
a scheme devised by corrupt rulers

302
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,245
in order to avoid true judgment
from the gods.

303
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,844
Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell
will stand trial before seven septons

304
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,809
as it was in the earliest
days of the Faith.

305
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,003
Seven blessings to all.

306
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,889
Seven blessings.

307
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,520
Your Grace.

308
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,011
That old rumor you told me about.

309
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,287
My little birds investigated.

310
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,601
And?

311
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,125
Was it just a rumor or something more?

312
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,965
More.

313
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,725
Much more.

314
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,604
You seem happy.

315
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,810
I am happy...

316
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,088
You should both be happy as well.

317
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,926
Not so long ago,
this city was ready to devour itself.

318
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,126
Now it's like a man reborn.

319
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,328
I will be happy when our queen returns.

320
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,883
Why don't you drink?
Why don't either of you ever drink?

321
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,240
Unsullied never drink.

322
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,401
- Why not?
- Rules.

323
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,001
And who made these rules?

324
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,161
Your former masters?

325
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,325
Those miserable old shits
didn't want you to be human.

326
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,008
Have a drink with me.

327
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,683
And you? What's your excuse?

328
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:30,162
I have tried wine before.
It made me feel funny.

329
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,810
That's how you know it's working.

330
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,005
Here's to our queen.

331
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,887
Anyone not drinking
is disrespecting our queen.

332
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,322
To Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons,
Breaker of Chains,

333
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,960
long may she reign.

334
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,122
- Long may she reign.
- Long may she reign.

335
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,441
Do you like it?

336
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,568
Tastes like it has turned.

337
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,889
Yes, yes. Fermentation.

338
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:11,764
One day, after our queen has taken
the Seven Kingdoms,

339
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,643
I'd like to have my own vineyard.

340
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,243
Make my own wine.

341
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,924
The Imp's Delight.

342
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,167
Only my close friends could drink it.

343
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,400
Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath.

344
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,246
I do not know any jokes.

345
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,081
Grey Worm?

346
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,920
Right.

347
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,404
Three lords walk into a tavern.

348
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,448
A Stark, a Martell and a Lannister.

349
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,649
They order ale,

350
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,326
but when the barkeep brings them over,

351
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,920
each of them finds a fly in his cup.

352
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,403
The Lannister, outraged,
shoves the cup aside and demands another.

353
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:02,371
The Martell plucks the fly out
and swallows it whole.

354
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,443
The Stark reaches into his cup,

355
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,762
pulls out the fly and shouts...

356
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,126
Spit it out, you wee shit.
Spit it out.

357
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,527
It's funnier in Westeros.

358
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,570
The Starks and the Lannisters,
I thought these were enemies.

359
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,841
Yes.

360
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,685
A joke is like a story,
Torgo Nudho.

361
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,684
Not a true story, necessarily.

362
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,286
A story that's supposed
to make you laugh ideally.

363
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,929
Not at the moment, perhaps.

364
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,207
Missandei, do you like the wine?

365
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,800
I do.

366
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,126
Tell a joke.

367
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,091
Two translators are on a sinking ship.

368
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,802
The first says...

369
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,649
Do you know how to swim?

370
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,645
The second says, no, but I can
shout for help in 19 languages.

371
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,082
That is the worst joke I ever heard.

372
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,605
You don't even know what a joke is.

373
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,804
I am soldier all my life.
You think I never hear joke?

374
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,170
You lied to us.

375
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,161
I make joke.

376
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,280
More jokes.

377
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:40,001
I once walked into a brothel
with a honeycomb and a jackass.

378
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:42,050
The madam says...

379
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,166
The Masters have come
for their property.

380
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,726
Lord Edmure.

381
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,000
I apologize for the way
the Freys treated you.

382
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,481
A man of your birth deserves better.

383
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,571
You have my word you'll be
properly fed and clothed from now on.

384
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,124
I have your word?

385
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,040
Oh, good.

386
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,326
Good, that's...

387
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,448
That's a fine thing.

388
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,163
My uncle will never
surrender the castle, ser.

389
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,009
Whatever game you're playing.

390
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,208
The Blackfish is an old man.

391
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,282
A good death is all he can hope for.

392
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,284
But you, you have a child now,
I've heard.

393
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,286
A son you sired on your wedding night.

394
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,125
You're a potent man.

395
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,770
A son I've never met

396
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,845
born of a wife that I haven't seen
since our first night together.

397
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,410
You should be with them both.

398
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,007
I can arrange that, you realize?

399
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,208
Comfortable rooms for you
at Casterly Rock.

400
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:18,489
A tutor for your boy,
knights to train him to fight and to ride.

401
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,961
And when he comes of age,
he'll have a keep of his own.

402
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,281
Do you imagine yourself
a decent person?

403
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,050
Is that it?

404
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,249
After you've massacred my family.

405
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,724
Kept me in a cell for years.

406
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,087
Stolen our lands.

407
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,162
I'll remind you
that our houses are at war.

408
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,887
I'm sorry if this conflict
has inconvenienced you,

409
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,446
but rebelling against the Crown
does have consequences.

410
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,801
Says the man who shoved his sword
through his king's back.

411
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,565
Did I give you the impression
that this was a negotiation?

412
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:48,766
It's not.

413
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,610
You understand. On some level
you understand that you're an evil man.

414
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,004
I'll leave the judgments to the gods.

415
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,400
Well, that is convenient for you.

416
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:07,367
You're a fine-looking fellow,
aren't you?

417
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,366
Your square jaw,

418
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,369
your golden armor.

419
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,205
Tell me, I want to know.
I truly do.

420
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,330
How do you live with yourself?

421
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:30,842
All of us have to believe
that we're decent, don't we?

422
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,689
You have to sleep at night.

423
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,925
How do you tell yourself
that you're decent

424
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,366
after everything that you've done?

425
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,568
I was your sister's prisoner once.

426
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,328
She hit me on the head with a rock
if I remember correctly.

427
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,641
Yeah.

428
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,971
She should have killed you.

429
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,883
Perhaps, but she didn't.

430
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,927
Catelyn Stark hated me
just like you hate me.

431
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,368
But I didn't hate her.

432
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,771
I admired her.

433
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,209
Far more than her husband or her son.

434
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,567
Do you think I care whom you admire
and whom you don't?

435
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,927
No, I don't, but I'm telling you anyway
because you're my prisoner.

436
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,684
You don't have a choice.

437
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,888
The love she had for her children,
I was a little awed by it.

438
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,484
Reminded me of my sister.

439
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,291
Oh, I see.

440
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,010
You're a madman.

441
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:41,009
I'm not here to trade insults.

442
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,646
- Your sister was a strong...
- Don't talk about Cat!

443
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,731
I'll talk about whomever I want.

444
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,966
She loved her children.

445
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,169
I suppose all mothers do,

446
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,129
but Catelyn and Cersei,

447
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,726
there's a fierceness
you don't often see.

448
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,451
They'd do anything
to protect their babies.

449
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,370
Start a war. Burn cities to ash.

450
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,250
Free their worst enemies.

451
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,482
The things we do for love.

452
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,850
You didn't come here
to talk about our sisters.

453
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,325
That's exactly why I came here.

454
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,723
I love Cersei.

455
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,049
You can laugh at that if you want.
You can sneer. Doesn't matter.

456
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,364
She needs me.

457
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,929
And to get back to her,
I have to take Riverrun.

458
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,051
I'll send for your baby boy.

459
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:44,323
And I'll launch him into Riverrun
with a catapult.

460
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,691
Because you don't matter to me,
Lord Edmure.

461
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,489
Your son doesn't matter to me.

462
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:54,241
The people in the castle
don't matter to me.

463
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,367
Only Cersei.

464
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:03,768
And if I have to slaughter every Tully
who ever lived to get back to her,

465
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,203
that's what I'll do.

466
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:36,125
Who goes there?

467
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,725
Edmure Tully,

468
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,646
Son of Hoster Tully
and the rightful Lord of Riverrun.

469
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,931
I demand entry.

470
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,490
Don't let him in.

471
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,645
He's the Lord of Riverrun.
I have to obey his commands.

472
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,165
He's been their captive

473
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:58,164
ever since they murdered his king
at the Red Wedding.

474
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,406
Why do you think the people who murdered
his king at the Red Wedding

475
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,131
would decide to let him come home?

476
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,607
Because it's a trap, you idiot.

477
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,447
Don't let him in.

478
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:10,686
He's my lord, my lord.

479
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,169
I've sworn to serve the Lord of Riverrun
and obey his commands.

480
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,403
You're not obeying Edmure's commands.

481
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:21,326
You're obeying
the fucking Kingslayer's commands.

482
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,811
I demand entry.

483
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,080
My lord has given an order.

484
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,401
With a knife to his throat.

485
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,881
That is not a valid order.

486
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,724
Lower the drawbridge
and open the gate for Lord...

487
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,410
Aye, ser.

488
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:42,881
I'll have your head
before I surrender Riverrun.

489
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,043
You are not lord of this castle,
my lord.

490
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,641
- Lower the drawbridge.
- Aye, ser!

491
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,364
If you're wrong,

492
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,322
we've just surrendered
our most valuable prisoner.

493
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,649
Welcome home, my lord.

494
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,088
Command all the forces within the castle
to lay down their arms.

495
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,930
Open the gates.

496
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,241
- My lord...
- Your lord has given a command.

497
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,444
Infantry, advance!

498
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,849
Find the Blackfish.

499
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,850
Put him in irons
and hand him over to the Freys.

500
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,610
Find him.

501
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,967
Go on.

502
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,920
Come with us.

503
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,685
I've run before from the Red Wedding.
I'm not running again.

504
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,046
This is my family home.

505
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,522
Your family is in the North.
Come with us.

506
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,924
Don't die for pride
when you can fight for your blood.

507
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,967
You'll serve Sansa
far better than I ever could.

508
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,770
All the way down!

509
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,285
- Check that out!
- Go on, now.

510
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,969
I haven't had a proper
sword fight in years.

511
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,691
I expect I'll make
a damn fool of myself.

512
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,645
We found the Blackfish, my lord.

513
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,051
Good.

514
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,406
Bring him to me.

515
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,246
He died fighting, my lord.

516
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,447
- I was wrong. I admit it.
- That changes nothing.

517
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:07,927
The Unsullied could mount
a defense off the beachhead.

518
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,764
- If the slavers' forces...
- No more talking from you.

519
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,046
Your talking gave us this.

520
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,770
And I have acknowledged that.
I'm trying...

521
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,760
You're trying to tell me
what the army should do.

522
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,643
You do not know
what the army should do.

523
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,647
All right, what should the army do?

524
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:20,926
We'll not go to the beach.

525
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,808
If we go to the beach,
the Masters will take the pyramid.

526
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,247
The pyramid is the only place
in the city we can defend.

527
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,765
- We stay here.
- And then?

528
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,525
We wait for them to come to us.
Then we fight them.

529
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,844
Clegane.

530
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,002
What the fuck you doing here?

531
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,248
Chasing them. You?

532
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,810
Hanging them.

533
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,010
Any particular reason?

534
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,560
They're our men. Or they were.

535
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,166
They attacked a nearby sept
and murdered the villagers.

536
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,046
- Why do you want them?
- Same reason.

537
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,168
I was helping build it.

538
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,449
They killed a friend of mine.

539
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:05,885
You've got friends?

540
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:09,090
Not anymore. They're mine.

541
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,447
It's the Brotherhood's good name
they've dragged through the dirt.

542
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:13,369
Fuck your name. They're mine.

543
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:16,211
I killed you once before, Dondarrion.
Happy to do it again.

544
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,611
Drop that arrow, you bloody girl.

545
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:23,809
Tougher girls than you
have tried to kill me.

546
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,641
You can have one of them.

547
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,126
Two.

548
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,165
No, no, no.

549
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,241
We're not butchers. We hang them.

550
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,970
Hanging?

551
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,610
All over in an instant.

552
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,120
Where's the punishment in that?

553
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,606
- They die.
- We all bloody die.

554
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,523
Except this one here.

555
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,444
I'll only gut one of them.

556
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,885
No.

557
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,089
I'll chop off one hand.

558
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,170
We gave you two of the three
out of respect for your loss.

559
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,480
That's generous.

560
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,761
Bunch of nances.

561
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,288
There was a time I would have killed all
seven of you just to gut these three.

562
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,566
You're getting old, Clegane.

563
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,207
He's not.

564
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,803
Please don't.
I'll give you anything.

565
00:46:57,560 --> 00:46:59,369
Got anything to eat?

566
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,524
Enjoying yourself?

567
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,004
I prefer chicken.

568
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:20,683
You ought to join us.
We could use you.

569
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,571
I tried joining.
Didn't work out for me.

570
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,246
Clegane, we're here for a reason.

571
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:32,489
The Lord of Light is keeping Beric alive
for a reason.

572
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:37,687
He gave a failed, drunk priest
the power to bring him back for a reason.

573
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,367
We are part of something
larger than ourselves.

574
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:45,570
Lots of horrible shit in this world gets
done for something larger than ourselves.

575
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:56,040
Cold winds are rising in the North.

576
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,088
And you're going to go stop them?

577
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,130
We need good men to help us.

578
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,805
Last time you saw me,
you wanted to execute me.

579
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,409
True enough.

580
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:11,290
But the Lord of Light
gave you the power to defeat me.

581
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,361
Why?

582
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,403
I beat you because I'm
better than you, Beric.

583
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:21,565
I was better than you before you started
yammering on about the Lord,

584
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:24,405
and I'm better than you now.

585
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,289
Aye, you're probably right.

586
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,129
You're a fighter.

587
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,771
You were born a fighter.

588
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,411
You walked away from the fight.

589
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,720
How did that go?

590
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,248
Good and bad, young and old,

591
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,641
the things we're fighting
will destroy them all alike.

592
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,803
You can still help a lot more
than you've harmed, Clegane.

593
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,362
It's not too late for you.

594
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,051
Lady Crane?

595
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,210
Lady Crane?

596
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:17,448
If you'd have done your job,
she would have died painlessly.

597
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:20,721
Instead...

598
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,367
The Many-Faced God
was promised a name.

599
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,962
He must always receive what is his.

600
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,728
You can't change that.

601
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,284
I can't change that.

602
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:37,290
No one can.

603
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,647
And now he's been promised
another name.

604
00:50:58,120 --> 00:50:59,770
- Hey!
- Get out!

605
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:25,921
Hey!

606
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,285
My basket!

607
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:24,168
It will all be over soon.

608
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,049
On your knees or on your feet?

609
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:41,611
Haven't we been through this already?

610
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,889
That won't help you.

611
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:58,602
You told her to kill me.

612
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:06,841
Yes.

613
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,404
But here you are.

614
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,085
And there she is.

615
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:25,161
Finally a girl is no one.

616
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,645
A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell

617
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,563
and I'm going home.
