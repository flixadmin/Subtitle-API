<i>To the outside world, I'm</i>
<i>an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:13,313
<i>but secretly, with the help</i>
<i>of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

5
00:00:13,315 --> 00:00:16,917
<i>I fight crime and find</i>
<i>other meta-humans like me.</i>

6
00:00:16,919 --> 00:00:18,819
<i>I hunted down the man</i> <i>who killed my mother,</i>

7
00:00:18,821 --> 00:00:22,189
<i>but in doing so, I opened up</i>
<i>our world to new threats,</i>

8

<i>Why are you here?</i>

12
00:00:31,967 --> 00:00:33,333
Because I want to go faster,

13
00:00:33,335 --> 00:00:34,868

14

It means a lot, you looking after Barry.

Barry's not the only person
here I wanna keep safe.

17
00:00:43,412 --> 00:00:45,512
We found Barry's double,

My name was Hunter Zolomon.

21
00:00:52,488 --> 00:00:54,755
I thought that if I could find
my doppelganger on this Earth,

22
00:00:54,757 --> 00:00:57,925
I could replace my damaged cells
with some of his healthy ones.

23
00:00:57,927 --> 00:01:00,194
I've been vibing Zoom,

24
00:01:00,196 --> 00:01:01,595
I've been near that thing.

00:01:01,597 --> 00:01:05,065

Let's put it this way,

00:05:18,253 --> 00:05:20,587
you just annihilated your old record.

101
00:05:20,589 --> 00:05:23,590

If it sucks, then, yeah.

110
00:05:46,148 --> 00:05:48,915
Yes, uh, just a minor issue.

111
00:05:48,917 --> 00:05:50,116
We closed all the breaches

122

Zoom is not tied to anything.

128
00:06:22,451 --> 00:06:25,151
Zoom does not care for anyone.

129
00:06:25,153 --> 00:06:26,653

My daughter's out here

131
00:06:28,223 --> 00:06:30,557
I have to find her. We all have people

132
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:33,026
that we care about.
Zoom will use that against us.

133
00:06:33,028 --> 00:06:36,997
Believe me.

134
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:38,598
Maybe we should just leave it be.

135
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,700
No, no. Look, no. Look, we're...

136
00:06:40,702 --> 00:06:42,702
We're not turning our backs
on another Earth.

137
00:06:42,704 --> 00:06:44,771
We're not gonna let Zoom

138
00:06:44,773 --> 00:06:46,439
get away with everything that he's done.

139
00:06:46,441 --> 00:06:52,045
Right now, there is no way
to another Earth, Allen.

140
00:06:52,047 --> 00:06:54,214
Let's keep it that way.

141
00:06:57,386 --> 00:06:59,619
We're getting back to Earth-2.

142
00:06:59,621 --> 00:07:02,055
With or without his help.

143
00:07:02,057 --> 00:07:04,224
Let's go to work.

144
00:07:06,795 --> 00:07:08,828
Hey, where are you going?

145
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,564
We could use your help.

146
00:07:10,566 --> 00:07:12,198
Uh, yeah, I would.

147
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,236
It's just I have a date with Scott.

- Yeah, yeah.

00:07:19,074 --> 00:07:20,941
That's good. No, I'm glad
that you're finding a way

150
00:07:20,943 --> 00:07:22,842
to move on without anything
holding you back.

151
00:07:22,844 --> 00:07:24,077
You deserve that.

152
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,545
Yeah, and well, I would have been able

153
00:07:25,547 --> 00:07:27,080
to do it without your support.

154
00:07:27,082 --> 00:07:28,748
It means a lot to me, so...

155
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,883
- Of course.
- Thanks.

156
00:07:29,885 --> 00:07:31,885
Yes, for sure.

157
00:07:31,887 --> 00:07:34,421
Well hey, I mean, if you don't
get this breach problem

158
00:07:34,423 --> 00:07:37,724
fixed by tonight, pencil me in for tomorrow?

159
00:07:37,726 --> 00:07:39,793
I can do that.

160
00:07:39,795 --> 00:07:41,161
Okay.

161
00:07:48,904 --> 00:07:50,537

- Mm-hmm.

163
00:07:52,274 --> 00:07:53,873
Hey, you sticking around after dinner?

164
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:56,242
Me and Wally are gonna watch Formula 1.

165
00:07:56,244 --> 00:07:59,212
Mm. No, I can't.

166
00:07:59,214 --> 00:08:00,814
I got to get back to the lab.

167
00:08:00,816 --> 00:08:02,382
I'm still trying to find a way
back to Earth-2.

168
00:08:02,384 --> 00:08:03,883
Can't you just stick Wells on it?

169
00:08:03,885 --> 00:08:05,619
No, he refused.

170
00:08:05,621 --> 00:08:09,289
Doesn't want me or anybody
opening the breaches again.

171
00:08:09,291 --> 00:08:10,724
Well, I can't believe I'm saying this

172
00:08:10,726 --> 00:08:13,126
about a man I shot at...
And punched in the face,

173
00:08:13,128 --> 00:08:14,728
but I think you should listen to him.

174
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:15,529
Why?

175
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:16,972
Barry, it worries the hell out of me

176
00:08:16,974 --> 00:08:18,907
the thought that you want
to go back to Earth-2.

177
00:08:19,653 --> 00:08:23,021
I'm faster now.
I'm faster than I've ever been.

178
00:08:23,023 --> 00:08:25,323
I'm faster than Zoom.

179
00:08:25,325 --> 00:08:27,425
I can take him down.

180
00:08:27,427 --> 00:08:28,494
All I'm saying is,

181
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:30,117
you already escaped the hornet's nest once.

182
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:31,785

- Hey.
- Wally!

185
00:08:36,025 --> 00:08:38,292
We got some pizza here
all the way from Keystone City.

186
00:08:38,294 --> 00:08:40,561
Hope it's cool I brought my laundry over.

187
00:08:40,563 --> 00:08:42,529
Of course. Barry used to do his laundry here

188
00:08:42,531 --> 00:08:44,131
all the time when he was in college.

189
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:45,465
That's cause those machines in the dorm

190
00:08:45,467 --> 00:08:47,200
always eat your quarters, right?

191
00:08:47,202 --> 00:08:49,503
Actually, I'm not, uh,
living on campus anymore.

192
00:08:49,505 --> 00:08:51,838
What? Since when?

193
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,107
Since room and board
became way more expensive

194
00:08:54,109 --> 00:08:55,676
than I thought.

195
00:08:55,678 --> 00:08:57,377
Man, I can help you out with that.

196
00:08:57,379 --> 00:08:58,912
I mean, I figured your money must be tight

197
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:02,049
after paying
all your mother's medical bills.

198
00:09:02,051 --> 00:09:04,751
How much more is it?

199
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:06,286
No, it's, uh, it's cool.

200
00:09:06,288 --> 00:09:07,688
Come on, Wally, let me help you out.

201
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,656
Plus I got that mini-fridge in the garage.

202
00:09:09,658 --> 00:09:10,824
You can use that, too, if you want.

203
00:09:10,826 --> 00:09:13,894
Joe, I'm good. Really.

204
00:09:13,896 --> 00:09:15,829
All right.

205
00:09:15,831 --> 00:09:18,899
Uh, let me just put these in real quick.

206
00:09:20,903 --> 00:09:24,838
Man, I can't figure that kid out sometimes.

207
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,174
I wonder if his doppelganger's
that complicated.

208
00:09:34,216 --> 00:09:36,583
Hey. Wow.

209
00:09:36,585 --> 00:09:38,452
Um, any ideas?

210
00:09:38,454 --> 00:09:41,722
Well, the best plan
we've come up with so far

211
00:09:41,724 --> 00:09:43,190
is to set off a nuclear warhead

212
00:09:43,192 --> 00:09:44,791
next to the city's electrical grid, so...

213
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:47,694
We're not gonna do that. Um...

214
00:09:47,696 --> 00:09:49,930
I think I thought of something though.

215

<i>[dramatic music]</i>

216

Tell me everything that you know
about Cisco's doppelganger.

217
00:09:55,437 --> 00:09:56,803
Reverb.

218
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:59,306
What were Reverb's powers on your Earth?

219
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:01,408
He could tap into the
multi-dimensional energies

220
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,010
between Earths.

221
00:10:03,012 --> 00:10:04,945
He could see through dimensions.

222
00:10:04,947 --> 00:10:07,014
Find breachers, like Ramon.

223
00:10:07,016 --> 00:10:09,516
I mean, we... we saw Reverb
do more than that though, right?

224
00:10:09,518 --> 00:10:12,519
I mean, we saw him shoot vibrational bursts

225
00:10:12,521 --> 00:10:14,921
out of his hands. Really painful ones.

226
00:10:14,923 --> 00:10:16,323
What do you mean?

227
00:10:16,325 --> 00:10:19,493
I... I mean, Reverb had
the ability to somehow

228
00:10:19,495 --> 00:10:21,962
manipulate that multi-dimensional energy.

229
00:10:21,964 --> 00:10:24,197
- What's your point, Allen?
- My point is...

230
00:10:24,199 --> 00:10:26,600
if his powers are linked to the energy

231
00:10:26,602 --> 00:10:29,036
that ties together the multi-verse...

232
00:10:29,038 --> 00:10:30,771
if he can manipulate it...

233
00:10:30,773 --> 00:10:32,639
Then he can open a breach
to any Earth he wants.

234
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:36,176
Exactly. And if Reverb could do it...

235
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:38,412
I could do it too.

236
00:10:38,414 --> 00:10:43,250
Cisco, I think the way back
to Earth-2 is you.

237
00:10:54,244 --> 00:10:56,544
I got nothing.

238
00:10:56,546 --> 00:10:58,046
Try again, okay?

239
00:10:58,048 --> 00:10:59,347
Barry, what if he can't do it

240
00:10:59,349 --> 00:11:00,615
because he thinks he can't do it?

241
00:11:00,617 --> 00:11:02,717
He can do it though. You can do it.

Oh, you've got company. Um...

- Okay.

258
00:11:59,743 --> 00:12:01,943
Later, Joe.

259
00:12:04,748 --> 00:12:06,748
Ah.

260

Thank you. Look, um,

I just...

263
00:12:19,296 --> 00:12:22,363
have you had any luck locating my daughter?

264
00:12:22,365 --> 00:12:25,066
Not yet, but I circulated her picture

through every department in the region.

to some friends in Keystone.

She's smart.

268

I just... I couldn't do it.

that Barry and I are meant to be together.

And now that I'm finally ready to move on,

393
00:18:29,222 --> 00:18:31,989
I just wonder if that should be with Barry.

pointing in that direction.

Hey. What are you doing?

I mean, you can decorate it how you like.

- Make it your own.
- Whoa, wait, Joe.

What is this?

404

Wally, forgive me.

405
00:19:06,425 --> 00:19:08,292
When Barry and Iris went to college,

406
00:19:08,294 --> 00:19:10,561
they couldn't get away fast enough.

407
00:19:10,563 --> 00:19:12,029
They wanted nothing to do
with their old man.

408
00:19:12,031 --> 00:19:14,665
It didn't even occur to me

409
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:17,301
that you might feel differently.

410
00:19:17,303 --> 00:19:19,770
It's embarrassing, but it took Barry

411
00:19:19,772 --> 00:19:21,572
to help me see that.

412
00:19:21,574 --> 00:19:24,808
So, if you still haven't
found a place to live,

413
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,076
live here.

414
00:19:26,078 --> 00:19:30,814
I mean, it's yours if you want to.

415
00:19:30,816 --> 00:19:32,583
You're serious?

416
00:19:32,585 --> 00:19:34,585
I'm not gonna do your laundry.

417
00:19:34,587 --> 00:19:36,420
And I'm not washing dishes after you.

418
00:19:36,422 --> 00:19:38,455
And this bed is going to be made
every morning before you leave.

419
00:19:38,457 --> 00:19:40,291
And there will be no beer in that fridge,

420
00:19:40,293 --> 00:19:42,960
but yeah, it's yours.

421
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,497
When can I move in?

422
00:19:46,499 --> 00:19:48,766
Whenever you want.

423

into other worlds,

Reverb was doing, then...

what if this is how I become Vader?

444

Dude, you're never going to become Vader.

You don't know that.
That is what happened to Reverb.

He learned how to use his abilities,

447
00:21:00,072 --> 00:21:02,339
and when he felt that,

448
00:21:02,341 --> 00:21:04,842
when he felt that power,

449
00:21:04,844 --> 00:21:06,877
he succumbed...

I've been terrified
about what it might mean for me.

this is gonna be for you,

I know, and I want to be supportive.

Well, you remember when I was looking

00:22:36,602 --> 00:22:37,935
for his doppelganger, right?

486
00:22:37,937 --> 00:22:39,937
Yeah. And you couldn't find him.

487
00:22:39,939 --> 00:22:42,172
Because there is no
Jay Garrick on this Earth.

488
