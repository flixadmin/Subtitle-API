1
00:01:09,428 --> 00:01:10,429
Tata.

2
00:01:43,378 --> 00:01:44,546
Pablo.

3
00:05:51,001 --> 00:05:52,085
Hmm.

4
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:55,171
Hmm.

5
00:06:22,324 --> 00:06:24,368
When Pablo Escobar starts believing

6
00:06:24,451 --> 00:06:28,664
the pen's mightier than the sword...
you know you're getting to him.

7
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:37,839
Carrillo's attacks on Pablo's
facilities in Medellín were putting him

8
00:06:37,923 --> 00:06:40,050
under more and more pressure.

9
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:44,512
The way Carrillo saw it...

10
00:06:44,596 --> 00:06:49,267
...each sicario we took out got
us one step closer to Escobar.

11
00:07:01,363 --> 00:07:03,137
While everyone could agree

12
00:07:03,162 --> 00:07:04,807
it felt good emptying Pablo's pockets...

13
00:07:09,955 --> 00:07:12,290
...they weren't all sold on the method.

14
00:07:15,796 --> 00:07:16,797
Is it true?

15
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:20,568
- Not to my knowledge.
- Don't play word games with me.

16
00:07:20,651 --> 00:07:23,218
If that kid's telling the truth,
Peña and Murphy were there.

17
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:25,637
They're the only Americans
that asshole trusts.

18
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,852
I find it hard to believe that Colonel
Carrillo would want American witnesses.

19
00:07:29,936 --> 00:07:31,142
Exactly what he wants.

20
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:35,029
Guarantees they won't say shit if people
start asking questions. And guess what?

21
00:07:35,112 --> 00:07:37,323
People are asking questions.

22
00:07:41,535 --> 00:07:43,537
Look, if Carrillo wants
to walk out in the streets

23
00:07:43,621 --> 00:07:47,166
and gun down every sicario
in Medellín, God bless him.

24
00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:49,741
But our guys can't be
there when he does it.

25
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,446
Understood?

26
00:07:54,048 --> 00:07:55,049
Understood.

27
00:07:55,132 --> 00:07:58,093
It's been quiet for about a
week. Nothing of significance.

28
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:01,847
But a phone we connected to Edgar
Prisco popped up three times last night.

29
00:08:01,931 --> 00:08:04,809
All within Manrique, the same
three-block vicinity here.

30
00:08:04,892 --> 00:08:07,686
They just can't fucking
help themselves, can they?

31
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:09,869
My men did a drive-by
early this morning

32
00:08:09,894 --> 00:08:11,548
and identified a potential location.

33
00:08:11,607 --> 00:08:14,068
Right here. The pool hall.

34
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:40,881
Murphy! Not a good neighborhood
to get yourself lost in, eh?

35
00:10:42,758 --> 00:10:43,592
Fuck.

36
00:11:51,827 --> 00:11:54,246
Shh, shh, shh.

37
00:12:11,222 --> 00:12:12,849
Fuck.

38
00:12:13,182 --> 00:12:16,644
Murphy! Gavera 37! You
need to get up here!

39
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,858
Murphy, get in the car.

40
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,030
The fuck were you thinking?

41
00:12:35,704 --> 00:12:37,414
This fucking close.

42
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:41,710
We were definitely getting closer.

43
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:44,672
And so who could blame
the "Gentlemen of Cali"

44
00:12:44,755 --> 00:12:48,634
for starting to think about a
future without Pablo Escobar?

45
00:15:52,443 --> 00:15:54,546
If it seemed like Escobar's world

46
00:15:54,571 --> 00:15:56,679
was crashing down around him,

47
00:15:56,739 --> 00:15:58,783
it was actually about to get worse.

48
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:03,495
Remember when Pablo
collaborated with M-19 communists

49
00:16:03,579 --> 00:16:05,790
during the Palace of Justice siege?

50
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:10,044
By doing that, he pissed
off the Autodefensas...

51
00:16:10,586 --> 00:16:13,172
an extreme right-wing
paramilitary group

52
00:16:13,255 --> 00:16:16,008
that was in direct conflict
with the communist guerrillas.

53
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:25,434
The leaders of the Autodefensas
were the Castaño brothers:

54
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:27,102
Fidel and Carlos.

55
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,605
Carlos is the one
barking orders at people.

56
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,775
In the late 70s, their father, Jesús,

57
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:36,320
a prominent landowner, was
kidnapped by the FARC guerrillas

58
00:16:36,403 --> 00:16:39,531
who demanded 50 million
pesos for his ransom.

59
00:16:39,615 --> 00:16:42,618
But his sons were only
able to come up with 16.

60
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:46,121
Well, that didn't cut it.

61
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,874
So the guerrillas beat the
elder Castaño to death.

62
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:53,629
From that day forward, the right-wing,

63
00:16:53,712 --> 00:16:57,341
psychopathic, commie-killing
Castaño brothers

64
00:16:57,424 --> 00:17:00,219
swore never to rest until
their father was avenged...

65
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:06,892
...and every last guerrilla driven
from the countryside was killed.

66
00:17:12,523 --> 00:17:14,240
Even innocent villagers

67
00:17:14,265 --> 00:17:16,885
who simply lived in
guerrilla strongholds

68
00:17:16,944 --> 00:17:20,406
were put to death because they
lived under communist subjugation.

69
00:17:24,868 --> 00:17:27,996
And in their efforts to wipe
out the communist guerrillas...

70
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:33,877
the Castaños caught the attention
of some like-minded friends.

71
00:17:35,128 --> 00:17:37,923
- Mr. Stechner.
- Good to see you, my friend.

72
00:17:38,006 --> 00:17:41,176
- Welcome. Have a nice trip?
- Thank you. As always, as always.

73
00:17:46,181 --> 00:17:49,601
These weapons are better
than the last ones.

74
00:17:49,685 --> 00:17:50,519
They should be.

75
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:53,814
Thank you, Mr. Green, for the
continued support of your country.

76
00:17:54,648 --> 00:17:57,526
I haven't used that name since
the School of the Americas.

77
00:17:58,151 --> 00:18:01,697
I know you're waging a great war
against communism in these jungles.

78
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:05,325
We will not stop until
the last communist is dead.

79
00:18:05,409 --> 00:18:07,035
Another struggle is emerging.

80
00:18:08,579 --> 00:18:13,458
One that is essential to
our, uh... shared cause.

81
00:18:14,793 --> 00:18:15,627
Escobar.

82
00:18:15,711 --> 00:18:18,046
Escobar deserves to die.

83
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:22,759
But our fight is here in the
jungle, against the guerrilla.

84
00:18:22,843 --> 00:18:26,221
Yes, and Pablo's still
strong in Medellín.

85
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:29,474
Yeah, strength is exceedingly relative.

86
00:18:34,938 --> 00:18:37,728
An alliance is forming...

87
00:18:37,753 --> 00:18:40,843
with the objective
of taking out Escobar.

88
00:18:40,903 --> 00:18:42,029
Who?

89
00:18:42,112 --> 00:18:44,448
Rival elements from
the trafficking world.

90
00:18:45,824 --> 00:18:49,661
Look, what matters most is that
when Escobar's taken off the board,

91
00:18:49,745 --> 00:18:53,707
the right parties are in a position
to make sure order is maintained.

92
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:57,502
And that strategic Colombian
resources and revenue streams...

93
00:18:58,462 --> 00:19:00,505
don't fall into the wrong hands.

94
00:24:59,906 --> 00:25:00,949
Mmm.

95
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:01,379
Get the lecture from Messina
about not leaving base?

96
00:28:01,463 --> 00:28:02,464
Yeah.

97
00:28:03,173 --> 00:28:05,926
Crosby must've really
laid into her on that one.

98
00:28:16,644 --> 00:28:19,564
- Where you going?
- Out. Off base.

99
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:23,902
Okay, I guess it means "Fuck that."

100
00:30:22,895 --> 00:30:24,939
Her name is Maritza Rincón.

101
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:28,192
She works at the market across from
the brothel where the girls were killed.

102
00:30:28,276 --> 00:30:30,570
Where we almost had La
Quica and the other guy...

103
00:30:31,404 --> 00:30:34,282
Jhon Burgos. Goes by "Limón."

104
00:30:34,365 --> 00:30:38,328
He used to drive the girls around until
La Quica made him Escobar's chauffeur.

105
00:30:38,411 --> 00:30:42,290
This girl Maritza was actually in
the back seat serving as a cover

106
00:30:42,373 --> 00:30:44,292
while Escobar was in the fucking trunk.

107
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:47,128
- And he knows her how?
- They grew up together here.

108
00:30:51,883 --> 00:30:54,260
So this guy Limón,
there's no record of him.

109
00:30:54,344 --> 00:30:57,180
There's no known connection
between him and Escobar,

110
00:30:57,263 --> 00:30:59,223
yet somehow he ends up the driver.

111
00:30:59,307 --> 00:31:02,518
Makes sense for La Quica to hire
someone the police didn't know about.

112
00:31:02,602 --> 00:31:04,896
What does she want out of
this? A ticket to Disneyland?

113
00:31:04,979 --> 00:31:07,440
She knows she doesn't get
shit if it doesn't pan out.

114
00:31:16,616 --> 00:31:19,160
You were there. You trust her?

115
00:31:22,163 --> 00:31:23,081
Yeah.

116
00:31:24,207 --> 00:31:25,708
Yeah, I do.

117
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:37,345
When we get the location, I want
Centra Spike up in the air to confirm.

118
00:31:42,058 --> 00:31:44,477
- All right. This is good.
- Let's go.

119
00:36:25,049 --> 00:36:25,883
Peña.

120
00:36:36,185 --> 00:36:39,313
I need to know if there's
activity around this address.

121
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:41,774
You get a match on a voice,
you find me immediately.

122
00:36:41,857 --> 00:36:43,359
Okay. You got it.

123
00:37:04,964 --> 00:37:06,190
This was recorded about

124
00:37:06,215 --> 00:37:07,699
- five minutes ago.
- You can barely hear it.

125
00:37:07,758 --> 00:37:08,759
Let me clean it up.

126
00:37:16,976 --> 00:37:18,686
- That's Pablo.
- We have to move now.

127
00:37:18,769 --> 00:37:20,896
- Yeah.
- You two are staying here.

128
00:37:21,564 --> 00:37:22,898
Gotta be fucking kidding me.

129
00:37:22,982 --> 00:37:25,032
Crosby finds out you
went on another raid,

130
00:37:25,057 --> 00:37:25,800
we all get a ticket home.

131
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,166
Crosby doesn't have to know shit.

132
00:37:28,529 --> 00:37:29,864
It's not negotiable.

133
00:37:33,659 --> 00:37:35,578
We'll be in radio contact.

134
00:37:38,205 --> 00:37:39,415
Jesus.

135
00:38:28,631 --> 00:38:31,258
Copy that. Watch your six, guys.

136
00:38:32,301 --> 00:38:33,928
How's it looking out there?

137
00:38:40,226 --> 00:38:41,477
Cheap bastards.

138
00:38:42,603 --> 00:38:45,272
Don't forget to pick me and
Peña up some cigars on the way.

139
00:39:24,728 --> 00:39:27,356
Goddamn it, speak to
me! We need people there.

140
00:39:45,875 --> 00:39:47,209
Fuck!

141
00:42:37,338 --> 00:42:40,591
I'll go back to Bogotá with
the body until the funeral.

142
00:42:42,551 --> 00:42:44,261
They call his wife?

143
00:42:44,345 --> 00:42:46,388
Yeah, she's on her way from Madrid.

144
00:42:48,223 --> 00:42:51,810
This ain't on you,
Javi. It's on Escobar.

145
00:42:51,894 --> 00:42:54,230
And one way or another, he pays.

146
00:42:55,981 --> 00:42:59,026
We all do. Right?

147
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:51,578
This isn't your fault, Peña.

148
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:54,039
- No?
- No.

149
00:43:59,253 --> 00:44:02,339
- I got played.
- We all got played.

150
00:44:02,423 --> 00:44:05,342
We all had the information, it
was backed up by Centra Spike...

151
00:44:05,426 --> 00:44:06,468
Stop.

152
00:44:08,971 --> 00:44:10,180
Just...

153
00:44:14,017 --> 00:44:15,602
You know, you coming here...

154
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:20,691
you say all the right things.

155
00:44:24,778 --> 00:44:27,072
Doesn't make a damn bit of difference.

156
00:44:33,537 --> 00:44:36,832
Colonel Carrillo's
funeral will be tomorrow.

157
00:44:40,794 --> 00:44:42,838
I don't do funerals.

158
00:52:12,579 --> 00:52:14,039
Hey.

159
00:52:16,333 --> 00:52:18,001
What are you doing here?

160
00:52:22,964 --> 00:52:24,341
