1
00:00:01,099 --> 00:00:04,261
My name is Oliver Queen.
For five years,

2
00:00:04,361 --> 00:00:07,462
I was stranded on an island
with only one goal--

3
00:00:07,464 --> 00:00:09,714
survive.

4
00:00:09,716 --> 00:00:11,532
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:11,534 --> 00:00:14,085
Now I will
fulfill my father's dying wish--

6
00:00:14,087 --> 00:00:16,221
to use the list
of names he left me

7
00:00:16,223 --> 00:00:19,174
and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

8
00:00:19,176 --> 00:00:21,426
To do this,

9
00:00:21,428 --> 00:00:23,428
I must become someone else.

10
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,132
I must become
something else.

11
00:00:27,534 --> 00:00:29,167
Previously on "Arrow"...

12
00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:30,735
It's done.
And he won't be harmed?

13
00:00:30,737 --> 00:00:32,387
Nor will he ever discover
your involvement.

14
00:00:32,389 --> 00:00:34,339
You have my word.

15
00:00:35,507 --> 00:00:38,309
You know Digs, when I confront
somebody on the list,

16
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:41,128
I tell them
they failed the city.

17
00:00:42,398 --> 00:00:44,816
But tonight...

18
00:00:44,818 --> 00:00:47,802
Tonight it was me
who failed.

19
00:00:59,481 --> 00:01:02,250
Get that hose over
to the north face

20
00:01:02,252 --> 00:01:04,585
or we're liable
to lose the whole block!

21
00:01:05,838 --> 00:01:07,205
Danny!
Yes, Keith?

22
00:01:07,207 --> 00:01:09,007
Getting a little smokey
out here, buddy.

23
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:12,010
Just clearing
the upper level.

24
00:01:12,012 --> 00:01:14,662
Hey you, over here.

25
00:01:14,664 --> 00:01:17,382
I can use some help.
I got a hot spot.

26
00:01:19,218 --> 00:01:21,001
Hey! What--oh!

27
00:01:21,003 --> 00:01:23,554
Ohh! What--

28
00:02:22,281 --> 00:02:25,232
How you doin'?

29
00:02:25,234 --> 00:02:27,001
Rehab going good?

30
00:02:29,404 --> 00:02:31,672
Any news on Walter?

31
00:02:31,674 --> 00:02:33,925
My contact at the Bureau
struck out.

32
00:02:33,927 --> 00:02:36,243
Same with my guy
at Interpol.

33
00:02:36,245 --> 00:02:38,412
They're both saying
the same thing.

34
00:02:38,414 --> 00:02:40,131
Either my stepfather
doesn't want to be found

35
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:43,017
or someone doesn't want him
to be found.

36
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:44,886
It's been
six weeks, Oliver.

37
00:02:44,888 --> 00:02:47,438
No contact
from the kidnappers,

38
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,941
no ransom demand,
no proof of life.

39
00:02:49,943 --> 00:02:51,309
I hate to sound--

40
00:02:51,311 --> 00:02:53,594
Dig...

41
00:02:53,596 --> 00:02:57,865
We both know he's more
than likely dead.

42
00:02:59,434 --> 00:03:01,119
What do you want to do?

43
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:02,820
I don't know.

44
00:03:02,822 --> 00:03:05,823
Even my contacts in the Bratva
can't dig up a lead.

45
00:03:05,825 --> 00:03:07,959
I wasn't talking about Walter.

46
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,448
Back at fighting weight,
looks like.

47
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,551
And last I checked,
there were more than a few names

48
00:03:16,553 --> 00:03:18,886
to cross off in this book.

49
00:03:20,288 --> 00:03:23,975
Those people aren't
going anywhere.

50
00:03:23,977 --> 00:03:27,478
With Walter missing,
my family needs me right now.

51
00:03:30,465 --> 00:03:33,184
Call your people,
tell them to bring the plane.

52
00:03:33,186 --> 00:03:35,770
My people will be
here shortly.

53
00:03:35,772 --> 00:03:37,488
Do you not
think it convenient

54
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,824
you captured me
so easily?

55
00:03:39,826 --> 00:03:41,826
Go!

56
00:03:41,828 --> 00:03:44,412
What?
Run!

57
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:16,969

59
00:04:20,816 --> 00:04:25,069
And, Judge Hinkle is ready
to grant them another continuance!

60
00:04:25,071 --> 00:04:26,871
So I said, hell, no.

61
00:04:26,873 --> 00:04:28,522
This trial starts
right now.

62
00:04:28,524 --> 00:04:31,191
That a girl.
Thanks.

63
00:04:33,695 --> 00:04:35,880
Dad.

64
00:04:35,882 --> 00:04:37,465
What brings you by?

65
00:04:37,467 --> 00:04:39,867
I need to talk to jo.

66
00:04:39,869 --> 00:04:43,554
Is everything ok, Mr. Lance?
No.

67
00:04:48,093 --> 00:04:51,429
What's happening?
No.

68
00:04:51,431 --> 00:04:53,347
Her brother Danny.

69
00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:55,399
He was killed
on duty last night.

70
00:04:55,401 --> 00:04:56,934
Jo, I'm so sorry.
No.

71
00:04:56,936 --> 00:04:59,270
No, no!

72
00:04:59,272 --> 00:05:01,656
I'm sorry.
No!

73
00:05:01,658 --> 00:05:04,692
Jo, it's okay!
No!

74
00:05:04,694 --> 00:05:07,795
Shh.

75
00:05:26,682 --> 00:05:28,916
Mom?

76
00:05:30,752 --> 00:05:32,436
Hey.

77
00:05:32,438 --> 00:05:33,771
Hey.

78
00:05:33,773 --> 00:05:37,425
I stopped by
the Big Belly Burger.

79
00:05:37,427 --> 00:05:40,027
I thought maybe you, me
and Thea, have some take-out,

80
00:05:40,029 --> 00:05:42,763
watch a DVD.

81
00:05:42,765 --> 00:05:45,616
Thank you, sweetheart.
I'm not very hungry.

82
00:05:47,369 --> 00:05:50,454
If you change your mind...

83
00:06:07,306 --> 00:06:09,223
I've seen
the movie before.

84
00:06:09,225 --> 00:06:10,725
Cut me some slack.

85
00:06:10,727 --> 00:06:12,760
I've been gone for a while

86
00:06:12,762 --> 00:06:14,812
and apparently I missed
the cinematic genius

87
00:06:14,814 --> 00:06:17,682
that is Zac

88
00:06:17,684 --> 00:06:21,319
Galafinak...is?

89
00:06:21,321 --> 00:06:23,854
I mean, with mom,

90
00:06:23,856 --> 00:06:25,773
when you and dad
disappeared,

91
00:06:25,775 --> 00:06:28,659
she spent more and more
time at home.

92
00:06:28,661 --> 00:06:32,363
Eventually stopped going
out altogether.

93
00:06:32,365 --> 00:06:34,198
What snapped her
out of it that time?

94
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,834
Walter.

95
00:06:36,836 --> 00:06:39,954
One morning,
he showed up

96
00:06:39,956 --> 00:06:43,157
and, you know, when he gets all
British and stern-like.

97
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:45,426
"Moira, get dressed.

98
00:06:45,428 --> 00:06:47,678
We're going out
for lunch."

99
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,014
And, I mean,
it worked.

100
00:06:50,016 --> 00:06:51,515
Hmm.

101
00:06:51,517 --> 00:06:54,802
You know,
I've been thinking.

102
00:06:54,804 --> 00:06:57,221
Maybe Walter
wasn't abducted.

103
00:06:57,223 --> 00:07:00,691
Maybe he's having
some mid-life crisis

104
00:07:00,693 --> 00:07:04,061
and he's with some
stewardess in Bora Bora,

105
00:07:04,063 --> 00:07:05,813
and he's too ashamed
to call home

106
00:07:05,815 --> 00:07:07,448
and say that he's okay.

107
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:09,250
Just because
we haven't heard from him

108
00:07:09,252 --> 00:07:12,119
doesn't mean he's...

109
00:07:12,121 --> 00:07:14,855
he's gone, right?

110
00:07:14,857 --> 00:07:16,073
Right.

111
00:07:16,075 --> 00:07:18,209
So what strikes me
is that this Vigilante

112
00:07:18,211 --> 00:07:20,527
was actually
making a difference.

113
00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:22,163
In the four months
that he was active,

114
00:07:22,165 --> 00:07:24,548
assaults were down,
muggings down.

115
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:27,418
The murder rate
dropped by 16%.

116
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,253
So in a very
quantifiable way,

117
00:07:29,255 --> 00:07:31,172
this man in the hood

118
00:07:31,174 --> 00:07:33,491
had been a positive
force in this city.

119
00:07:33,493 --> 00:07:37,778
So where has he been
for the past six weeks?

120
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:40,464
Looks like
everyone's disappearing.

121
00:07:48,323 --> 00:07:49,740
Hey.

122
00:07:58,867 --> 00:08:00,835
What's this?

123
00:08:00,837 --> 00:08:03,120
It's--it's nothing?
It's nothing?

124
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:12,079
"Reasons I deserve a drawer"--

125
00:08:12,081 --> 00:08:13,130
Okay, we're going
to table this

126
00:08:13,132 --> 00:08:15,916
for a less
tragedy-filled day.

127
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:17,685
Yeah, and besides,

128
00:08:17,687 --> 00:08:20,438
I don't think
we're there yet.

129
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,473
I should probably get that.

130
00:08:22,475 --> 00:08:23,991
All right.

131
00:08:28,447 --> 00:08:30,931
I need your help.

132
00:08:30,933 --> 00:08:33,868
Jo, come in.

133
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:38,456
I, um...

134
00:08:40,108 --> 00:08:43,627
I don't think what happened
to Danny was an accident.

135
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:47,498
I think he might
have been murdered.

136
00:08:50,085 --> 00:08:55,289
Jo, do you remember
when Sarah died?

137
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:58,325
I did all this research to try to
find an explanation

138
00:08:58,327 --> 00:09:00,327
for why the boat
went down.

139
00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:03,981
I needed to believe
that it wasn't just an accident.

140
00:09:03,983 --> 00:09:06,800
That is not what
I am doing, Laurel.

141
00:09:06,802 --> 00:09:08,819
I once handled a case

142
00:09:08,821 --> 00:09:12,439
for a clerk
in the Coronor's Office.

143
00:09:12,441 --> 00:09:16,143
He passed me a copy
of the incident report.

144
00:09:16,145 --> 00:09:20,114
Said that Danny's turnout coat
was doused in turpentine.

145
00:09:20,116 --> 00:09:22,867
But I checked,
and the plant owner

146
00:09:22,869 --> 00:09:25,035
said that there wasn't
any in the factory.

147
00:09:25,037 --> 00:09:27,021
A turnout's supposed
to withstand temperatures

148
00:09:27,023 --> 00:09:29,373
in excess of 500 degrees.

149
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:31,926
But the coroner said
that the fire

150
00:09:31,928 --> 00:09:34,178
did not exceed 250.

151
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,496
How did my brother

152
00:09:36,498 --> 00:09:40,534
burn hotter than the fire
that supposedly killed him?

153
00:09:46,224 --> 00:09:47,975
Laurel, a fireman died
fighting a fire.

154
00:09:47,977 --> 00:09:49,527
I'm not sure I see the crime.

155
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:51,345
I did some digging.

156
00:09:51,347 --> 00:09:54,565
Last week, another firefighter,
Leo Barnes, was killed in action,

157
00:09:54,567 --> 00:09:56,867
same circumstances.
Traces of turpentine,

158
00:09:56,869 --> 00:09:59,904
and ignition temperatures hotter
than the actual fire.

159
00:09:59,906 --> 00:10:02,689
Do you think that you could
talk to the fire marshal?

160
00:10:02,691 --> 00:10:05,042
You know, encourage him
to pursue this?

161
00:10:05,044 --> 00:10:07,461
Well, the fire department
has its own investigative unit.

162
00:10:07,463 --> 00:10:08,829
They don't answer to the police.

163
00:10:08,831 --> 00:10:10,714
Sorry it takes so long
with the detectives.

164
00:10:10,716 --> 00:10:12,082
CSU's been
really backed up.

165
00:10:12,084 --> 00:10:13,584
Well, did you find anything?

166
00:10:13,586 --> 00:10:15,252
The only prints
on it are yours,

167
00:10:15,254 --> 00:10:17,204
the tech inside
is military grade.

168
00:10:17,206 --> 00:10:19,490
I can't even trace
the manufacturer.

169
00:10:19,492 --> 00:10:21,559
Forensics-wise,
it's a dead end.

170
00:10:21,561 --> 00:10:24,812
Another case?

171
00:10:24,814 --> 00:10:26,713
Vigilante.

172
00:10:26,715 --> 00:10:28,232
The phone belongs to him.

173
00:10:28,234 --> 00:10:30,401
Where'd you get it?

174
00:10:30,403 --> 00:10:32,102
I--does he answer?

175
00:10:32,104 --> 00:10:36,774
Well, like Kelton said,
it's a dead end.

176
00:10:36,776 --> 00:10:38,492
Listen, kiddo, I feel
for Jo and her family

177
00:10:38,494 --> 00:10:39,944
I really do, but, um,

178
00:10:39,946 --> 00:10:42,913
there's a lot
I can do this end.

179
00:10:42,915 --> 00:10:45,449
I got to go. I love you.

180
00:10:45,451 --> 00:10:47,751
Hey. Let's go.

181
00:11:03,084 --> 00:11:05,585
Hello?

182
00:11:05,587 --> 00:11:07,738
I need your help.

183
00:11:26,782 --> 00:11:28,483
I didn't trust
that you'd come.

184
00:11:28,485 --> 00:11:30,118
No one's seen you
for a while.

185
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,486
Where have you been?

186
00:11:31,488 --> 00:11:34,238
You said it was important.

187
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,674
My best friend's
brother.

188
00:11:36,676 --> 00:11:39,827
He died two days ago
fighting a fire.

189
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:41,963
The police
and fire department

190
00:11:41,965 --> 00:11:44,299
say that he died
in the line of duty.

191
00:11:44,301 --> 00:11:47,001
But my friend,
she thinks he was murdered.

192
00:11:47,003 --> 00:11:49,187
So you're asking
one killer to find another.

193
00:11:49,189 --> 00:11:52,890
I heard what you said
to your father about me;

194
00:11:52,892 --> 00:11:54,309
that I'm a killer.

195
00:11:54,311 --> 00:11:56,311
That I have no remorse.

196
00:11:56,313 --> 00:11:59,514
Do you?

197
00:11:59,516 --> 00:12:02,466
Take a look
at the file.

198
00:12:02,468 --> 00:12:03,868
If Danny de La Vega
was murdered,

199
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:06,554
then we have to bring
his killer to justice.

200
00:12:10,275 --> 00:12:13,828
I'll look into it.

201
00:12:19,869 --> 00:12:22,670
You need to rotate
your hips, Diggle.

202
00:12:22,672 --> 00:12:24,989
That's where
the power comes from.

203
00:12:24,991 --> 00:12:28,004
It's not just your arms, even if
they're the size of bowling balls.

204
00:12:28,221 --> 00:12:29,890
Laurel reached out
to the Hood last night.

205
00:12:30,547 --> 00:12:32,496
Really? Thought
the Vigilante

206
00:12:32,498 --> 00:12:34,682
spooked her pretty
well last time.

207
00:12:34,684 --> 00:12:38,019
She thinks somebody's
killing firemen.

208
00:12:38,021 --> 00:12:39,437
It looks
all in the job.

209
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:41,189
Seems pretty thin.

210
00:12:41,191 --> 00:12:44,192
Will you look into it?
Yeah.

211
00:12:44,194 --> 00:12:46,861
I have a friend who has a friend
in the fire investigations department.

212
00:12:46,863 --> 00:12:48,563
I'll reach out.

213
00:12:48,565 --> 00:12:51,515
If you get any leads,
tip the police.

214
00:12:52,868 --> 00:12:55,186
The police?

215
00:12:55,188 --> 00:12:57,021
They just need something
to jump start them.

216
00:12:57,023 --> 00:13:00,241
Well, isn't the whole idea
of being a vigilante,

217
00:13:00,243 --> 00:13:02,543
is that you do
the police's job?

218
00:13:02,545 --> 00:13:04,528
You know, Oliver,
you've been spending

219
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:05,630
a lot of time
around here lately.

220
00:13:05,632 --> 00:13:07,298
I thought after six weeks,

221
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,333
you'd be anxious
to hood up.

222
00:13:09,335 --> 00:13:12,387
Hell, I even prepared
the "you got to slow down" speech.

223
00:13:14,641 --> 00:13:18,976
Let me see what's going on
upstairs in the club.

224
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:36,244
You know, I do realize
that it's difficult

225
00:13:36,246 --> 00:13:37,829
for you to manage
my nightclub,

226
00:13:37,831 --> 00:13:39,580
what with there not
being an actual nightclub here.

227
00:13:39,582 --> 00:13:42,417
Yeah, I just took the liberty
of yelling at our contractor.

228
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:44,568
I told him if we didn't see
any real progress,

229
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:47,088
we were going to bring
someone else in to finish the job.

230
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,873
Good.

231
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,425
How's Laurel's friend?

232
00:13:50,427 --> 00:13:52,293
The one whose brother
was a fireman?

233
00:13:52,295 --> 00:13:53,744
She is hanging
in there, thanks.

234
00:13:53,746 --> 00:13:55,129
I have something
I wanted to bring up.

235
00:13:55,131 --> 00:13:56,764
I was thinking
that we could

236
00:13:56,766 --> 00:13:58,883
throw a fundraiser
for the fire department.

237
00:13:58,885 --> 00:14:00,518
Raise some money
for the families.

238
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,253
That's a great idea.
We could do it here.

239
00:14:02,255 --> 00:14:04,355
We could keep
the overhead low,

240
00:14:04,357 --> 00:14:07,391
make sure we maximize
the proceeds to the firemen.

241
00:14:07,393 --> 00:14:10,478
Who are you?
Where's my friend Tommy Merlin?

242
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,397
The guy who once rented out
a pro football stadium

243
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:15,766
so that he could play
strip kickball with models.

244
00:14:15,768 --> 00:14:19,620
That guy needed
a swift kick in his lazy ass.

245
00:14:22,107 --> 00:14:24,292
Jo...

246
00:14:24,294 --> 00:14:25,776
You really should
take some time off

247
00:14:25,778 --> 00:14:27,628
and go be with your family.

248
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,997
You know, I seem to
recall when Sarah died,

249
00:14:29,999 --> 00:14:32,467
you hit the books
pretty hard.

250
00:14:32,469 --> 00:14:36,120
I am not exactly the best example
for healthy grieving.

251
00:14:36,122 --> 00:14:39,123
Hey. Can I talk to you, please?

252
00:14:41,844 --> 00:14:44,178
Where is it?

253
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,564
Where's what?
The phone.

254
00:14:46,566 --> 00:14:48,182
I'm sorry.

255
00:14:48,184 --> 00:14:49,901
I know I shouldn't have.

256
00:14:49,903 --> 00:14:51,468
It's stolen evidence!

257
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,653
Yeah, you probably shouldn't have.
What are you--

258
00:14:52,655 --> 00:14:54,238
I had to do something.

259
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,807
That man's a killer.

260
00:14:56,809 --> 00:14:58,642
Then why did he
give you his phone?

261
00:14:58,644 --> 00:15:00,477
Give me the phone.

262
00:15:00,479 --> 00:15:03,147
He took it back.

263
00:15:04,249 --> 00:15:06,167
You were with him?

264
00:15:06,169 --> 00:15:08,202
When Sarah died, if someone
could have done something

265
00:15:08,204 --> 00:15:10,922
to give you even just
a little bit of closure,

266
00:15:10,924 --> 00:15:12,456
don't you wish
that they would have done it?

267
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:13,841
If it meant
breaking the law,

268
00:15:13,843 --> 00:15:17,178
lying to the people
closest to them...No.

269
00:15:20,966 --> 00:15:25,553
Surely there are contingencies
for these types of situations.

270
00:15:25,555 --> 00:15:28,339
Bring someone over
from our London office, perhaps.

271
00:15:28,341 --> 00:15:32,026
It's not solely a matter of the day
to day operations.

272
00:15:32,028 --> 00:15:35,396
We have accountants
and the vice presidents to do that.

273
00:15:35,398 --> 00:15:37,899
It's about perception.
Public confidence.

274
00:15:37,901 --> 00:15:41,002
Ned, the company will be fine.

275
00:15:41,004 --> 00:15:42,537
I don't mean
to be indelicate,

276
00:15:42,539 --> 00:15:44,722
but this is
the second time

277
00:15:44,724 --> 00:15:46,357
in five years
that the CEO

278
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:48,209
of Queen Consolidated

279
00:15:48,211 --> 00:15:50,411
has vanished under mysterious
circumstances .

280
00:15:50,413 --> 00:15:53,197
I don't need you
to remind me of that.

281
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,867
The last thing I want
to do is upset you.

282
00:15:56,869 --> 00:16:00,254
Well, then you should consider
this visit doubly disappointing.

283
00:16:01,423 --> 00:16:03,808
Good day.

284
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:11,766
Who was that?

285
00:16:11,768 --> 00:16:13,234
Ned Foster.

286
00:16:13,236 --> 00:16:14,735
The C.O.O. of the company.

287
00:16:14,737 --> 00:16:16,821
He wants mom
to take Walter's place.

288
00:16:16,823 --> 00:16:20,274
He says that the company's
stock price has been damaged

289
00:16:20,276 --> 00:16:22,393
by Walter's absence,

290
00:16:22,395 --> 00:16:26,514
and my stepping in
would help settle the board.

291
00:16:26,516 --> 00:16:29,733
But I told him that I needed to be
at home, for my family.

292
00:16:29,735 --> 00:16:31,319
Mom...

293
00:16:31,321 --> 00:16:33,254
Thea and I are fine.

294
00:16:33,256 --> 00:16:34,839
We can manage here
without you.

295
00:16:34,841 --> 00:16:37,908
This sounds like something
everyone needs you to do.

296
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:41,412
Well, maybe I don't care
what everyone needs.

297
00:16:48,253 --> 00:16:50,972
She's going to be
all right, Thea.

298
00:16:50,974 --> 00:16:52,423
Mr. Queen, we're going to
have to get going

299
00:16:52,425 --> 00:16:54,358
if you want to make
your dentist appointment.

300
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,776
Now, sir.

301
00:16:58,313 --> 00:17:00,615
Eyewitnesses place
a '72 Ford pick up at the scene

302
00:17:00,617 --> 00:17:02,984
of Danny de La Vega's fire.
Okay.

303
00:17:02,986 --> 00:17:05,403
Stagg Chemical lit
up ten minutes ago.

304
00:17:05,405 --> 00:17:07,438
I hacked into Stagg's video
security feeds.

305
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,323
Parked right on
the street running along the plant.

306
00:17:09,325 --> 00:17:10,658
Same pick up.

307
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:13,327
I got your gear
in the car.

308
00:17:16,281 --> 00:17:19,383
Oliver, by the time
I get someone on the phone

309
00:17:19,385 --> 00:17:20,785
who will even listen to me,
at least one of those fireman

310
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,193
are going to be dead.

311
00:17:23,222 --> 00:17:26,557
They need the man in the hood.

312
00:18:05,965 --> 00:18:09,266
I have contact.
Two clicks southwest.

313
00:18:24,484 --> 00:18:26,683
Portable one
to Deputy Chief Seven.

314
00:18:26,685 --> 00:18:28,685
All clear of civilians.

315
00:18:28,687 --> 00:18:31,355
Copy that. Bail out and wait
for second-in companies.

316
00:18:42,217 --> 00:18:44,552
Who are you?!

317
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:41,781
Hello?

318
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:44,317
I have some information for you.

319
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:47,587
The killer drives
a 1970s Ford pick up.

320
00:20:47,589 --> 00:20:50,457
There is a scar on his left wrist
from a severe burn

321
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:52,775
and a tattoo of a firefly.

322
00:20:52,777 --> 00:20:55,111
Well, then you must
have gotten pretty close to him.

323
00:20:55,113 --> 00:20:57,831
All the men
in Engine Company 15

324
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:59,582
had firefly tattoos.

325
00:20:59,584 --> 00:21:01,251
Any one of them
could be the killer.

326
00:21:01,253 --> 00:21:03,286
What should I do
with this information?

327
00:21:04,588 --> 00:21:07,374
Whatever you would have
done before you met me.

328
00:21:10,361 --> 00:21:12,145
Who was
on the phone?

329
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:14,547
Wrong number.

330
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:27,026
So Laurel's on her own
against a murderer

331
00:21:27,051 --> 00:21:28,696
who burns people alive?

332
00:21:28,697 --> 00:21:31,147
I can't right every
wrong in this city.

333
00:21:31,149 --> 00:21:34,584
No, I get that, Oliver.

334
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:37,670
But maybe you're not back
to 100% like you thought.

335
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:41,157
Maybe I'm not.

336
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:52,502
What did that prove?

337
00:21:52,504 --> 00:21:55,355
This is one sturdy desk.

338
00:21:57,007 --> 00:22:00,527
And clearly, your problem
isn't physical.

339
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:02,695
I never said I had a problem!
You didn't have to, Oliver.

340
00:22:02,697 --> 00:22:04,981
But this guy,
the other archer,

341
00:22:04,983 --> 00:22:07,016
he got in your head,
he took something from you.

342
00:22:07,018 --> 00:22:08,735
That's enough.

343
00:22:08,737 --> 00:22:10,686
He took whatever's
in your heart

344
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,522
that lets you
jump off buildings

345
00:22:12,524 --> 00:22:14,390
and take down
bad guys.

346
00:22:14,392 --> 00:22:16,159
Thank you for the analysis.

347
00:22:16,161 --> 00:22:18,878
You can avoid Laurel,
Oliver, avoid me,

348
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,465
avoid this,
as long as you want.

349
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:25,701
But until you're ready to take
a hold of the fear that's in you,

350
00:22:25,703 --> 00:22:28,138
you might as well
let that archer kill you.

351
00:22:29,873 --> 00:22:33,810
Text from Tommy.

352
00:22:35,429 --> 00:22:38,181
I need to run an errand
for the benefit

353
00:22:38,183 --> 00:22:40,383
at the firemen's station.
Maybe while you're at it,

354
00:22:40,385 --> 00:22:42,101
you can let me know
if you still want to be a vigilante

355
00:22:42,103 --> 00:22:45,572
or just
a nightclub owner.

356
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:50,777
Hey.

357
00:22:50,779 --> 00:22:52,862
What are you
doing here?

358
00:22:52,864 --> 00:22:55,615
I told Joanne
I'd clean out Danny's locker.

359
00:22:55,617 --> 00:22:56,899
And you?

360
00:22:56,901 --> 00:22:58,785
Tommy sent me over
to make sure

361
00:22:58,787 --> 00:23:00,620
the guest list for the firemen's
gala was accurate.

362
00:23:00,622 --> 00:23:03,256
Tommy's been working
very hard on that.

363
00:23:03,258 --> 00:23:04,757
It's very generous
of you, Oliver.

364
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:07,093
It's truly not.

365
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:09,629
Speaking of Tommy,

366
00:23:09,631 --> 00:23:13,766
he told me that you're being
very protective of your drawers.

367
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:16,603
This is not a fancy term
for your underwear.

368
00:23:16,605 --> 00:23:20,590
Are you and I seriously
having this discussion?

369
00:23:20,592 --> 00:23:22,342
Well, we're friends.

370
00:23:22,344 --> 00:23:24,110
Yes.

371
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:27,030
Tommy asked
for a drawer.

372
00:23:27,032 --> 00:23:28,764
And this is bad?

373
00:23:28,766 --> 00:23:30,817
No.

374
00:23:30,819 --> 00:23:33,386
It's just...

375
00:23:33,388 --> 00:23:37,023
I'm an all or nothing
type of girl.

376
00:23:37,025 --> 00:23:39,042
First it's a drawer,

377
00:23:39,044 --> 00:23:40,910
then it's a closet,

378
00:23:40,912 --> 00:23:42,412
half my rent,
it's half my life.

379
00:23:42,414 --> 00:23:45,665
Am I really ready to do that
with Tommy?

380
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:47,867
You could take it slow.

381
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:50,336
I don't things slow,
remember?

382
00:23:50,338 --> 00:23:52,622
I close my eyes
and I jump,

383
00:23:52,624 --> 00:23:54,424
just like you.

384
00:23:54,426 --> 00:23:57,510
I think that's why
we spooked each other.

385
00:23:57,512 --> 00:24:00,980
Our feelings...
our fears, they control us,

386
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:02,982
it's not the other
way around.

387
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:06,569
You know?
Yeah.

388
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:09,639
I have to get inside.

389
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,311
There are eight firemen
in this picture.

390
00:24:15,313 --> 00:24:17,030
I did some research.

391
00:24:17,032 --> 00:24:20,483
You called yourselves
the fireflies.

392
00:24:20,485 --> 00:24:22,818
Yeah, well, that station house
was shut down a few years back.

393
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,655
All the guys went
to different companies, so...

394
00:24:25,657 --> 00:24:28,708
Four of these men
are now dead.

395
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:31,327
It's not all getting cats
out of trees, Ms. Lance.

396
00:24:31,329 --> 00:24:33,630
But three of them died
within the last six weeks,

397
00:24:33,632 --> 00:24:35,682
except for that man
right there.

398
00:24:35,684 --> 00:24:38,384
Garfield Lynns.
He died two years ago

399
00:24:38,386 --> 00:24:40,353
in the Nodell Tower tragedy.

400
00:24:40,355 --> 00:24:42,138
Did you forget
something, Mr. Queen?

401
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:45,391
Just wanted to see if my friend
there needed some help.

402
00:24:45,393 --> 00:24:47,843
What was
the Nodell Tower?

403
00:24:47,845 --> 00:24:49,345
How do you not
remember that?

404
00:24:49,347 --> 00:24:53,166
I was WiFi-free
for a few years.

405
00:24:53,168 --> 00:24:56,869
It was 22 stories
of glass and steel.

406
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:58,735
Except it turned out
that the construction

407
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,240
company who built it

408
00:25:00,241 --> 00:25:03,826
used substandard materials
to save themselves a few bucks.

409
00:25:03,828 --> 00:25:05,962
It was nowhere near
the structural code.

410
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:07,413
Gas line blew.

411
00:25:07,415 --> 00:25:09,148
There was a fire.

412
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:11,968
Yeah. Melted right through
the stanchions.

413
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:14,304
Whole damn thing came down.

414
00:25:14,306 --> 00:25:15,888
Bad day.

415
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,590
34 civilians and six

416
00:25:17,592 --> 00:25:19,659
of my fellow firemen died.

417
00:25:19,661 --> 00:25:22,345
Do you need anything else,
Ms. Lance?

418
00:25:22,347 --> 00:25:26,566
Other than reminding me of all
the friends I've lost and buried?

419
00:25:34,057 --> 00:25:35,241
Hey!

420
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:37,527
What was that all about?

421
00:25:37,529 --> 00:25:41,230
It was nothing, Oliver.
I have to go.

422
00:25:53,076 --> 00:25:55,461
Hello?

423
00:25:55,463 --> 00:25:58,031
Are you there?

424
00:25:58,033 --> 00:26:01,100
I spoke to Danny's
old chief.

425
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:04,420
I didn't get anywhere.
What am I supposed to do now?

426
00:26:04,422 --> 00:26:07,273
Nothing. It's my turn.

427
00:26:44,446 --> 00:26:47,648
We have so many
of these old photos.

428
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:50,384
I really should
have them scanned in.

429
00:26:50,386 --> 00:26:53,754
Well, that's an incredibly
ambitious plan.

430
00:26:53,756 --> 00:26:55,506
Which will
have to wait.

431
00:26:55,508 --> 00:26:57,674
Why?
Because we're going to go out.

432
00:26:57,676 --> 00:26:59,543
To dinner
or to a movie

433
00:26:59,545 --> 00:27:02,712
or shopping. Anything to get you
out of the house.

434
00:27:02,714 --> 00:27:04,481
Ohh. No, Thea.

435
00:27:04,483 --> 00:27:06,266
I'm just too tired.

436
00:27:06,268 --> 00:27:09,219
Really, that's...
Pretty amazing,

437
00:27:09,221 --> 00:27:11,755
considering you've
been in bed all day.

438
00:27:11,757 --> 00:27:14,169
Please don't presume
to think that you know

439
00:27:14,194 --> 00:27:15,672
what I'm going through.

440
00:27:16,078 --> 00:27:18,746
I do know.

441
00:27:18,748 --> 00:27:22,216
I lost dad, too.

442
00:27:22,218 --> 00:27:25,719
I'm worried
about Walter, too.

443
00:27:25,721 --> 00:27:27,904
But I don't get
to worry about him,

444
00:27:27,906 --> 00:27:30,340
because I'm busy
worrying about you.

445
00:27:30,342 --> 00:27:31,908
I never asked you to do that.

446
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:34,461
Right.

447
00:27:34,463 --> 00:27:38,332
'Cause you don't ask me to do
anything anymore.

448
00:27:38,334 --> 00:27:40,317
You don't ask me
to do my homework

449
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:43,053
or to be home
at a decent hour.

450
00:27:43,055 --> 00:27:45,022
I mean, you basically
stopped being my parent.

451
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,473
Well, how's this--

452
00:27:46,475 --> 00:27:50,093
don't talk to your mother
like that.

453
00:27:50,095 --> 00:27:53,113
Maybe you should start
acting like my mother.

454
00:27:53,115 --> 00:27:56,417
So I don't have
to act like yours.

455
00:28:07,413 --> 00:28:10,581
I thought you were done
helping Laurel.

456
00:28:10,583 --> 00:28:13,967
The first firefly to die, his name
was Garfield Lynns.

457
00:28:13,969 --> 00:28:17,004
Well, being dead kind of rules him out
as a murder suspect, right?

458
00:28:19,175 --> 00:28:22,476
Oliver...

459
00:28:24,513 --> 00:28:27,681
I'm sorry I came at you so hard, man.
But I've been there.

460
00:28:27,683 --> 00:28:29,516
I know what it's like
to stare death in the face

461
00:28:29,518 --> 00:28:32,769
and...be the one who blinks.

462
00:28:32,771 --> 00:28:35,856
That's not it.

463
00:28:35,858 --> 00:28:37,908
I've...

464
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:40,177
I've been
close to death.

465
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:42,429
On the island...

466
00:28:42,431 --> 00:28:44,198
More times than
I can remember,

467
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,252
and I never
feared it.

468
00:28:48,254 --> 00:28:51,672
'Cause I had
nothing to lose.

469
00:28:51,674 --> 00:28:54,591
But when that archer
almost killed me;

470
00:28:54,593 --> 00:28:58,962
when I...
stared death in the face then,

471
00:28:58,964 --> 00:29:01,181
I thought about
all the people

472
00:29:01,183 --> 00:29:04,134
that I've let into my life since
I've been back.

473
00:29:04,136 --> 00:29:09,056
My family,
Laurel, Tommy.

474
00:29:09,058 --> 00:29:10,991
And that made me afraid.

475
00:29:10,993 --> 00:29:13,843
Afraid of what would
happen to those people

476
00:29:13,845 --> 00:29:16,847
if they lost me--again.

477
00:29:18,816 --> 00:29:24,104
And for the first
time in so long,

478
00:29:24,106 --> 00:29:27,508
I had something to lose.

479
00:29:28,877 --> 00:29:32,913
Well, you got it
backwards, Oliver.

480
00:29:32,915 --> 00:29:36,550
You think the people
you let in are taking your edge.

481
00:29:36,552 --> 00:29:38,535
I think it gives you one.

482
00:29:38,537 --> 00:29:41,138
Maybe a stronger one.

483
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,923
You can stare down death

484
00:29:42,925 --> 00:29:45,559
with something
to live for or not.

485
00:29:45,561 --> 00:29:47,728
Something to live for...

486
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:49,763
is better.

487
00:29:53,785 --> 00:29:57,887
All the men in the unit had
an alibi for Danny's murder.

488
00:29:57,889 --> 00:29:59,940
The guy that I fought
had a firefly tattoo

489
00:29:59,942 --> 00:30:02,125
and his arm
was severely burned.

490
00:30:02,127 --> 00:30:05,329
Okay. I don't see
where you're going with this.

491
00:30:05,331 --> 00:30:06,444
The Nodell Tower fire.

492
00:30:06,469 --> 00:30:07,681
Some of the bodies
were so badly burned,

493
00:30:07,781 --> 00:30:09,305
they couldn't even be
IDed off dental records.

494
00:30:09,306 --> 00:30:10,889
What if Garfield Lynns
didn't die,

495
00:30:10,891 --> 00:30:13,558
but was just
presumed dead?

496
00:30:43,756 --> 00:30:46,040
You know, ironically,

497
00:30:46,042 --> 00:30:47,592
if we get any more
people in here,

498
00:30:47,594 --> 00:30:48,743
we're going to violate
the fire code.

499
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:53,848
We're good on
drawer-gate, right?

500
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,916
All good.

501
00:30:59,772 --> 00:31:01,973
Excuse me.

502
00:31:01,975 --> 00:31:04,642
Can I borrow Laurel
for a second?

503
00:31:04,644 --> 00:31:06,444
Absolutely.

504
00:31:12,284 --> 00:31:13,618
Chief Raynes.

505
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:16,120
Hi. Mr. Queen,

506
00:31:16,122 --> 00:31:18,122
this is spectacular.
Ahh.

507
00:31:18,124 --> 00:31:20,992
The Starling City Firemen's
Relief Association

508
00:31:20,994 --> 00:31:22,443
can't thank you enough.

509
00:31:22,445 --> 00:31:24,295
You guys are
the real heroes.

510
00:31:24,297 --> 00:31:26,965
Like at the Nodell Tower fire,
which I've been reading up on.

511
00:31:26,967 --> 00:31:27,999
Oh, yeah?

512
00:31:28,001 --> 00:31:29,584
Garfield Lynns
was the first man

513
00:31:29,586 --> 00:31:30,802
to die in your unit.
Now, I read that

514
00:31:30,804 --> 00:31:32,503
they recovered his coat
in the wreckage,

515
00:31:32,505 --> 00:31:34,222
but they never
found his body?

516
00:31:34,224 --> 00:31:38,142
You always interrogate
your club's guests, Mr. Queen?

517
00:31:38,144 --> 00:31:39,844
Why?

518
00:31:39,846 --> 00:31:41,896
Do you feel like
you're being interrogated?

519
00:31:41,898 --> 00:31:44,148
You could see it
on your face at the fire station.

520
00:31:46,246 --> 00:31:49,247
There's more to the Nodell Tower
fire than people know about, isn't there?

521
00:31:49,654 --> 00:31:51,904
I've been doing this
a long time

522
00:31:51,906 --> 00:31:54,240
and I've never seen
a fire like that.

523
00:31:54,242 --> 00:31:57,409
It's like some monster out
of a science fiction movie.

524
00:31:57,411 --> 00:31:59,829
I radioed for my men to get
the hell out of there.

525
00:32:00,172 --> 00:32:02,213
But Lynns,
he wouldn't go.

526
00:32:02,214 --> 00:32:04,465
Begged me to send
the unit back in.

527
00:32:04,467 --> 00:32:06,850
But I wouldn't do it.

528
00:32:08,018 --> 00:32:10,385
I couldn't.

529
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:14,056
God help me,
I left him to burn.

530
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,809
But I can't bring him back.

531
00:32:17,811 --> 00:32:19,611
You don't have to.

532
00:32:19,613 --> 00:32:23,348
He is back.

533
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,219
What the hell
you talkin' about?

534
00:32:27,221 --> 00:32:29,655
Garfield Lynns killed Danny.

535
00:32:29,657 --> 00:32:31,573
And the other men
on your unit.

536
00:32:33,693 --> 00:32:36,712
There's no way he could have
survived that fire.

537
00:32:36,714 --> 00:32:38,592
You'd be surprised the power
revenge can give you.

538
00:32:38,593 --> 00:32:41,460
Thank you so much.
The people in the city

539
00:32:41,462 --> 00:32:43,912
appreciate everything you--

540
00:32:46,266 --> 00:32:49,301
You're insane. Gar did not
make it out of that building.

541
00:32:49,303 --> 00:32:52,921
Just like you won't
make it out of this one.

542
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:21,409
Go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go!

543
00:33:22,327 --> 00:33:23,994
Go, go, go, go!
This way!

544
00:33:23,996 --> 00:33:26,046
Gar, what the hell
are you doing?

545
00:33:30,332 --> 00:33:31,709
Run.

546
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,376
Go!

547
00:33:41,885 --> 00:33:44,387
Laurel?!

548
00:34:05,776 --> 00:34:07,610
Laurel? Laurel!

549
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:09,729
Where's Oliver?

550
00:34:09,731 --> 00:34:12,448
He's still inside!
We can't leave him.

551
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,233
Tommy!

552
00:34:19,506 --> 00:34:22,792
You know how long it takes
for your skin to melt?

553
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:24,761
I do.

554
00:34:24,763 --> 00:34:26,512
From experience.

555
00:34:26,514 --> 00:34:28,080
I told you to get out of there!

556
00:34:28,082 --> 00:34:29,632
And I told you

557
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:31,934
that we could
save the building.

558
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:33,936
But you got scared.

559
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:36,606
You lost your nerve.

560
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:38,691
You...left me in there

561
00:34:38,693 --> 00:34:40,026
to die.

562
00:34:40,028 --> 00:34:41,444
How did you get out?

563
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:43,229
I was pulled
from the wreckage.

564
00:34:43,231 --> 00:34:45,898
Listed as a John Doe
in the burn unit,

565
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,151
in a coma
for months.

566
00:34:48,153 --> 00:34:50,770
When I woke up
and saw

567
00:34:50,772 --> 00:34:53,623
what was left
of who I was...

568
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:57,443
I only had one thought.

569
00:34:57,445 --> 00:34:59,462
To leave you as alone

570
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:02,281
as you left me.

571
00:35:11,592 --> 00:35:13,309
Now it's your turn.

572
00:35:27,808 --> 00:35:31,361
Go!

573
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:32,695
It's over.

574
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,868
I'm not afraid to die.

575
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:41,504
I know.

576
00:35:41,506 --> 00:35:44,757
You're afraid to live.

577
00:35:44,759 --> 00:35:46,592
Let me get you out of here.

578
00:35:46,594 --> 00:35:48,878
Lynns.

579
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:51,931
Let me get you out.

580
00:35:56,887 --> 00:35:58,771
Thanks.

581
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:05,445
But I'm already burned.

582
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:25,337
Eyewitnesses contend that numerous
lives would have been lost

583
00:36:25,437 --> 00:36:28,271
if not for the timely
intervention of the Vigilante.

584
00:36:28,273 --> 00:36:30,723
But these were not
the actions of a vigilante.

585
00:36:30,725 --> 00:36:34,727
What's been described
are the actions of a hero.

586
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:38,448
What's got you all smiley?

587
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:40,416
Your new club's a briquette.

588
00:36:40,418 --> 00:36:41,784
It was under
construction before.

589
00:36:41,786 --> 00:36:44,003
Now it's more
under construction.

590
00:36:44,005 --> 00:36:46,456
Good morning.

591
00:36:46,458 --> 00:36:48,491
Sharp suit, Mom!

592
00:36:48,493 --> 00:36:51,744
Not used to seeing you without
your bedroom wrapped around you.

593
00:36:51,746 --> 00:36:55,247
Well, I could hardly
go to the office in my pajamas.

594
00:36:55,249 --> 00:36:57,917
I'm taking Walter's position
at the office.

595
00:36:57,919 --> 00:37:00,586
What changed your mind?

596
00:37:00,588 --> 00:37:04,140
Not what. Who.

597
00:37:04,142 --> 00:37:06,425
My daughter.

598
00:37:08,128 --> 00:37:10,113
My family.

599
00:37:10,115 --> 00:37:13,098
And I promise you,

600
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,485
Walter will
get back to us.

601
00:37:15,487 --> 00:37:18,037
I will keep looking for
him and I will find him.

602
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:20,439
And I'll see you
for dinner.

603
00:37:20,441 --> 00:37:22,125
Mm-hmm.

604
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,880
What?

605
00:37:27,882 --> 00:37:30,466
Just feeling the whiplash.

606
00:37:30,468 --> 00:37:34,754
She went from shut-in
to chairman pretty fast.

607
00:37:34,756 --> 00:37:37,006
Sounds like you got
through to her.

608
00:37:37,008 --> 00:37:39,509
Yeah, I guess.

609
00:37:39,511 --> 00:37:42,228
It'll just be
for a few months.

610
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:45,681
My mom, she's
taking it so hard.

611
00:37:45,683 --> 00:37:49,468
Whatever you have to do
to take care of your family.

612
00:37:51,021 --> 00:37:54,157
Before I forget...

613
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,697
My brother's badge.

614
00:38:04,918 --> 00:38:07,003
My mom was hoping

615
00:38:07,005 --> 00:38:09,705
maybe you could find
a way to get it

616
00:38:09,707 --> 00:38:12,825
to, you know...him.

617
00:38:12,827 --> 00:38:15,044
As a thank you.
I don't care

618
00:38:15,046 --> 00:38:17,847
what anyone has to say.

619
00:38:19,883 --> 00:38:23,102
He really is
a guardian angel.

620
00:38:24,221 --> 00:38:28,674
I'll find a way
to get it to him.

621
00:38:31,778 --> 00:38:34,513
I'm going to miss you.

622
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:38,784
Yeah.

623
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,075
Hey.

624
00:38:46,077 --> 00:38:47,192
Hey.

625
00:38:47,194 --> 00:38:48,411
You look after yourself,
all right?

626
00:38:48,413 --> 00:38:50,863
I will.
Good.

627
00:38:52,049 --> 00:38:57,720
So Joanna's taking
a leave of absence, huh?

628
00:38:57,722 --> 00:38:59,171
She has to go be
with her family.

629
00:38:59,173 --> 00:39:01,424
Yeah, well, family's important.

630
00:39:01,426 --> 00:39:03,976
I already apologized.

631
00:39:03,978 --> 00:39:05,210
It's my turn.

632
00:39:05,212 --> 00:39:06,896
After what happened last night,

633
00:39:06,898 --> 00:39:10,066
maybe it's a good thing
you got the Hood involved.

634
00:39:10,068 --> 00:39:13,385
He didn't take the phone
off you, did he?

635
00:39:38,762 --> 00:39:42,131
Maybe you should
hold on to this.

636
00:39:43,467 --> 00:39:47,103
I mean, I may not like
the guy's methods,

637
00:39:47,105 --> 00:39:49,088
but whoever this guy is,

638
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:51,791
he's got a habit of putting
himself between danger and you.

639
00:39:51,793 --> 00:39:54,760
And that's not something
I can argue with.

640
00:39:54,762 --> 00:39:58,147
Besides,

641
00:39:58,149 --> 00:40:00,866
I shouldn't
have this thing anyway.

642
00:40:05,455 --> 00:40:07,957
Kelton. We good?

643
00:40:07,959 --> 00:40:11,210
I got a strong signal
from the crystal vhf transmitter

644
00:40:11,212 --> 00:40:13,879
you hid in the speaker,
and it can't be backtraced.

645
00:40:13,881 --> 00:40:15,948
Talk to me like
I'm a third grader, please.

646
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,717
Next time your daughter
calls the Vigilante,

647
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:20,419
we'll be able to listen
to every word.

648
00:40:20,421 --> 00:40:23,806
I know you swore
to bring this guy down, Detective,

649
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:26,792
but using your own
daughter as bait,

650
00:40:26,794 --> 00:40:29,061
that's stone cold.

651
00:41:25,702 --> 00:41:29,021
Good thing the fire
didn't spread to down here.

652
00:41:34,911 --> 00:41:39,965
It's one of the benefits
of concrete and steel construction.

653
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:46,505
Thank you.

654
00:41:46,507 --> 00:41:49,708
What for?
You know what for!

655
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,762
So what's next?

656
00:41:52,764 --> 00:41:55,314
More training?
No.

657
00:41:57,383 --> 00:41:59,652
We go hunting.

658
00:41:59,677 --> 00:42:04,677
