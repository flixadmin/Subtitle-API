1
00:00:05,965 --> 00:00:06,965
Hey, you hungry?

2
00:00:07,342 --> 00:00:09,802
I was thinking blueberry pancakes
for breakfast this morning.

3
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:13,061
Or I could get us something fun
from that Brooklyn's Best Bagels place.

4
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,767
They just opened
a new location downtown.

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,020
Iris?

6
00:00:46,506 --> 00:00:47,757
[sighs]

7
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:49,801
[dialing]

8
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:52,679
- [phone ringing]
- [phone vibrating]

9
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:57,934
[suspenseful music playing]

10
00:01:06,442 --> 00:01:07,442
Iris.

11
00:01:07,694 --> 00:01:09,195
[dramatic music playing]

12
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:22,834
[laughing]
Thanks for the company, Cecile.

13
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:24,460
Anytime.

14
00:01:24,544 --> 00:01:27,005
You know, I figured you'd be
working this time of day.

15
00:01:27,088 --> 00:01:28,131
Oh, I was.

16
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:32,093
Yeah, I'm actually avoiding
a new meta client,

17
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:33,362
so I figured I'd get out of the office,

18
00:01:33,386 --> 00:01:35,096
come over,
see what Team Flash was up to.

19
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:40,852
Well, we're all good here. Yeah,
the town is quiet. No alerts, no crisis.

20
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:44,397
Just sweet, sweet, silence...

21
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,480
Okay.

22
00:01:45,607 --> 00:01:46,983
[digital beeping]

23
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:48,109
Barry, what's wrong?

24
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:51,049
[Chester] Yeah, should we be worried?

25
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:53,363
It's Iris.

26
00:01:55,283 --> 00:01:56,283
She's missing.

27
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:14,884
[digital beeping]

28
00:02:14,886 --> 00:02:17,472
Satellites aren't picking Iris up
anywhere in the city.

29
00:02:18,056 --> 00:02:19,776
I'm gonna expand the physical
search radius.

30
00:02:20,558 --> 00:02:21,893
Cecile, anything?

31
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,270
[exhales]

32
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,980
Nothing.

33
00:02:27,357 --> 00:02:30,443
I can't sense her either and I've
reached out across a five-state radius.

34
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:32,862
It's like Iris' mind has just vanished.

35
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:35,281
Same here, only worse.

36
00:02:35,365 --> 00:02:39,619
Barry, Iris isn't registering
anywhere on the planet.

37
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:41,120
How is that even possible?

38
00:02:41,204 --> 00:02:42,162
It's just like last time.

39
00:02:42,163 --> 00:02:45,291
She's not here anymore,
at least not in this plane of existence.

40
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:47,669
She must've had another attack.

41
00:02:49,295 --> 00:02:50,380
Now she's lost in time.

42
00:02:51,214 --> 00:02:53,508
Okay, well, then we need Deon
to find her.

43
00:02:53,633 --> 00:02:55,233
No one's seen
Deon since he disappeared,

44
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:57,553
and I can't access
the Still Force without him.

45
00:02:58,262 --> 00:02:59,262
Okay, so...

46
00:02:59,889 --> 00:03:01,307
So what do we do?

47
00:03:02,725 --> 00:03:07,605
Okay, okay, it's a long shot, but,
look, when Iris was in Coast City,

48
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:11,109
it wasn't just her time sickness
that caused her to vanish.

49
00:03:12,443 --> 00:03:14,529
Tinya Wazzo's powers did, too.

50
00:03:19,826 --> 00:03:21,285
[suspenseful music playing]

51
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:24,235
I can't believe you're serious.

52
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:26,767
You really want to try
and bring Frost back?

53
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:27,749
And I already have a plan.

54
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,646
I'm going to repurpose Eva McCulloch's
R-CEM chip

55
00:03:29,669 --> 00:03:33,798
to replicate Frost's cryo genes
so I can create a new body for her.

56
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:36,843
Caitlin, I know you're hurting,
so am I, but listen to yourself.

57
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:39,303
It worked before, it will work again.

58
00:03:39,804 --> 00:03:43,182
And what about the thing
that makes Frost... Frost?

59
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:47,061
I have already identified her latent
empathic genes on my DNA.

60
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:49,081
I'm talking about a soul
and you give me brain waves?

61
00:03:49,105 --> 00:03:54,068
I'm also going to extract
her active imprints from her own DNA.

62
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:55,713
Look, I've already got the sample.

63
00:03:55,737 --> 00:03:59,532
Unfortunately, the keratin in the cells
is decaying a little too quickly, so...

64
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,202
I'm going to need a better sample.

65
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:05,204
Are you talking about grave-robbing?

66
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:08,666
It's called an exhumation and I am
a doctor as well as the next of kin.

67
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:12,712
So getting approval won't be a problem.
We just, we need to do it quickly.

68
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:18,384
I know how this sounds.

69
00:04:18,468 --> 00:04:21,179
Oh, like that old horror movie
<i>Frankenstein Created Woman?</i>

70
00:04:23,556 --> 00:04:25,196
Does Team Flash know
what you're planning?

71
00:04:26,392 --> 00:04:27,435
Didn't think so.

72
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,562
They wouldn't understand.

73
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:30,772
Neither do I!

74
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:35,902
Caitlin, have you forgotten that
you literally just tried to resurrect

75
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:36,985
your dead husband?

76
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,614
And it was a complete disaster?

77
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:43,201
No, I haven't, but that thing
was never Ronnie, okay?

78
00:04:43,326 --> 00:04:46,496
Deathstorm used a physical form
that I love to try and trick us.

79
00:04:46,579 --> 00:04:48,456
Look, this is different.

80
00:04:48,873 --> 00:04:50,666
The science is solid. Trust me.

81
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:53,878
Yeah, mad science.

82
00:04:55,296 --> 00:05:01,677
Mark. Mark, Frost was supposed to live
a full and complete life.

83
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:06,641
You both were, together,
and now that's been taken from you.

84
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:09,435
Don't you want that back?

85
00:05:09,602 --> 00:05:10,602
[sighing in despair]

86
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,270
What do you think?

87
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:15,191
[exhilarating music playing]

88
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:20,279
You can process losing Frost
in whatever way you need to,

89
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:21,963
but as far as
all of this is concerned...

90
00:05:24,534 --> 00:05:26,244
[exhales] count me out.

91
00:05:31,207 --> 00:05:33,084
[dramatic music playing]

92
00:05:36,921 --> 00:05:37,964
[indistinct chatter]

93
00:05:57,358 --> 00:06:00,903
Tinya, uh, can we talk?

94
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,196
Why? I don't know you.

95
00:06:02,947 --> 00:06:06,826
I'm Barry Allen.
You know my wife, Iris West-Allen.

96
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:09,704
I'm really sorry,
but she's missing again

97
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:10,947
- and I don't know...
- Again?

98
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,540
Whatever. I don't care.

99
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:14,709
Your other half ruined my life.

100
00:06:15,835 --> 00:06:18,087
You have every right to be angry.

101
00:06:19,005 --> 00:06:20,005
I need your help.

102
00:06:20,256 --> 00:06:22,216
The first time Iris disappeared,
she was with you.

103
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:26,178
You mean when I wiped her
out of existence like she did to my mom?

104
00:06:27,305 --> 00:06:28,306
Are you okay?

105
00:06:28,848 --> 00:06:30,516
[eerie music playing]

106
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:35,145
What the hell?

107
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:38,315
Mom?

108
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:41,861
What did you do to my mom?

109
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:44,906
Tinya, she never meant to hurt anyone.

110
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:46,240
Well, I did.

111
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:48,561
Which is why you should back off.

112
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:52,622
Do you even understand
how your powers work?

113
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,544
Examining how they work could help us
answer what's really happening to Iris.

114
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:01,964
I don't care about Iris.
God, what is wrong with you?

115
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:07,011
You know, I was fine until Iris found me
and started spewing all that crap

116
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:09,555
about family and having faith in people.

117
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:14,268
She made me believe that I could have
the life that I always wanted.

118
00:07:15,311 --> 00:07:18,481
And now that's gone
and it's never coming back.

119
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:22,067
So welcome to the club.

120
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:31,619
[indistinct chatter continues]

121
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:34,538
[chatter stops]

122
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:43,547
[sinister sounds playing]

123
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,634
[Deon yelling]

124
00:07:52,556 --> 00:07:53,557
Deon, thank God.

125
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,227
- Iris is missing.
- Yeah, I know.

126
00:07:56,644 --> 00:07:59,855
Yeah, she's in the Still Force. I've
been trying to track her down, but...

127
00:07:59,981 --> 00:08:00,897
- [groans]
- Hey.

128
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:01,898
No, don't, don't.

129
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:05,832
[breathing heavily] I've been infected
by Iris' time sickness, too.

130
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:10,825
I need you to find the Isotopic Sensor.

131
00:08:11,826 --> 00:08:14,870
It's the only way we can track down
that particle that I placed inside Iris.

132
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:16,413
"We"?

133
00:08:17,373 --> 00:08:19,625
Barry, I can't find her alone.

134
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:21,961
I'm gonna need your help.

135
00:08:23,254 --> 00:08:27,967
Okay, but the sensor's damaged.
We're going to need to repair it first.

136
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:29,467
Okay.

137
00:08:30,011 --> 00:08:31,095
Okay, do it fast.

138
00:08:31,846 --> 00:08:33,014
I'll come back for you after.

139
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:41,731
[sinister music playing]

140
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:55,012
[Barry] This is how we get Iris back.

141
00:08:55,036 --> 00:08:57,305
So you're saying that Deon
wants to do that by bringing you

142
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:58,329
into the Still Force?

143
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:000
[Barry] Well, both of us, together.

144
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:04,336
I thought he said it was too dangerous
for anyone to go in there who wasn't,

145
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,378
you know, a god.

146
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:08,215
It's risky, but I trust Deon.

147
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:10,499
And he wouldn't suggest this
if there was any other way.

148
00:09:10,676 --> 00:09:12,219
Well, Deon's right about one thing.

149
00:09:12,303 --> 00:09:14,555
Our satellites can't trace
isotopic particles

150
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:17,016
across other planes of existence.

151
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,351
That's why we need you
to repair the sensor.

152
00:09:19,435 --> 00:09:20,787
It's the only thing that can locate

153
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:23,022
Iris' temporal particle
inside the Still Force,

154
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:25,483
but once we find her, we bring her home.

155
00:09:26,484 --> 00:09:27,484
Amen to that.

156
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:30,780
Not to question a god,
but why would Deon need help

157
00:09:30,863 --> 00:09:33,657
tracking a particle
that he created himself?

158
00:09:35,076 --> 00:09:38,621
Deon's not at full strength.

159
00:09:38,704 --> 00:09:40,706
Iris' time sickness
has affected him, too.

160
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:47,755
Chester, how long will it take
to get the sensor running?

161
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:50,591
An hour, maybe less,

162
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:52,301
but Barr, how are you going to

163
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,261
get inside the Still Force
in the first place?

164
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,239
Deon's going to come back for me
as soon as he can

165
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,743
and we need to be ready when he does.

166
00:09:57,932 --> 00:10:00,976
And you ran this plan past
the other Forces?

167
00:10:01,936 --> 00:10:05,022
Nora, Bashir, Alexa,
they're all on board, too?

168
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:09,527
Uh, no, I haven't been
able to contact them.

169
00:10:10,736 --> 00:10:12,029
Any of them.

170
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,365
And Iris' sickness,

171
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:17,138
it could have spread to them already.

172
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:19,703
Which would explain why
they've been radio silent.

173
00:10:19,912 --> 00:10:24,083
If that is the case,
then maybe we should all slow down

174
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:26,752
and figure it out before we launch you

175
00:10:26,836 --> 00:10:29,713
into a place where
we know nothing about, Barry.

176
00:10:29,797 --> 00:10:30,797
There's no time.

177
00:10:31,632 --> 00:10:35,886
Look, Joe, Deon is our only chance
at finding Iris.

178
00:10:36,428 --> 00:10:39,640
If he says going into the Still Force
is the answer, then I believe him.

179
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,980
I'm going to get the sensor
from the Starchives.

180
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,186
Meet you in your workshop.

181
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,771
I should get back to CCC.

182
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:47,773
Got to keep the lights on
until Iris is safe.

183
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,984
[suspenseful music playing]

184
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,617
- [Joe] Barr, hold up.
- [Barry] What?

185
00:10:58,701 --> 00:11:01,412
Look, I am willing to do
whatever it takes to bring Iris home,

186
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:02,848
but something don't feel right
about this.

187
00:11:02,872 --> 00:11:04,683
It's dangerous,
but we've taken greater risks before.

188
00:11:04,707 --> 00:11:07,501
Yes, we have,
but are you sure about the facts?

189
00:11:07,585 --> 00:11:10,225
Because you seem to be putting
a whole lot of faith in Deon's plan.

190
00:11:10,254 --> 00:11:11,422
Because I know it'll work.

191
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:14,884
That's what Deon thinks you should do.
What do you think you should do?

192
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:16,111
That's just it, I don't know.

193
00:11:16,135 --> 00:11:17,135
And Deon does?

194
00:11:17,303 --> 00:11:20,306
Look, Joe, I owe Deon this.

195
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:22,641
As soon as I learned
about Iris' time sickness,

196
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:25,162
I should have spent every waking moment
trying to find a cure.

197
00:11:25,186 --> 00:11:27,771
Even when she told me to stop pushing,
but I didn't.

198
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:29,899
Now it's worse,
plus Deon's affected, too.

199
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:33,861
If there's a chance I can find Iris and
make up for all this, I have to take it.

200
00:11:34,153 --> 00:11:35,905

[Chester exhales]

00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:52,255
- Parliament-Runkadelic.
<i>- It's Captain Kramer.</i>

205
00:11:52,463 --> 00:11:54,882
Yes. Yes, ma'am. How can I help?

206
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,801
Chester, I need a full analysis
on an unknown device

207
00:11:57,885 --> 00:11:59,011
we found at a crime scene.

208
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:02,473
You're not busy saving the world,
are you?

209
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,726
No, no, Captain, your timing is perfect.
[chuckles nervously]

210
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:07,978
Barry's gone to where no man's
been before,

211
00:12:08,062 --> 00:12:10,022
so I'm free to fly solo.

212
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:12,191
Great. Thanks. I'll see you soon.

213
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:14,401
Oh, you heard her, Chester P.,

214
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,738
the crime-fighting world
needs your mojo!

215
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:19,072
Mojo...

216
00:12:19,073 --> 00:12:20,073
Mojo.

217
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,701
Seven out of ten.

218
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,703
[sound intensifying]

- [Barry breathing heavily]

220
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:39,134
Oh, damn, moving through dimensions
is getting harder. Is that it?

221
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:41,553
Yeah, are you sure we can find her?

222
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:45,891
There's just one thing. Where we're
going, there's only one way in and out,

223
00:12:46,558 --> 00:12:47,726
and it's a bumpy ride.

224
00:12:48,102 --> 00:12:52,564
So hang on, because things
are about to get real weird.

225
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,650

Don't worry, you'll get used to it.

228
00:13:02,408 --> 00:13:04,535
[breathing heavily]
I've been here before.

229
00:13:06,203 --> 00:13:08,706
- When Iris...
- First got sick, yeah.

230
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:12,793
Place is like a doorway.

231
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:15,754
I call it my front porch.

232
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,467
I can see everything from here.

233
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:23,595
[rumbling]

[breathing heavily]

237
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:39,383
This place is different than before.

238
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:41,989
Yeah, that's because it's
more dangerous now.

239
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:44,491
[exhilarating music playing]

240
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:46,243
Welcome to the Still Force.

241
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,620
What's left of it.

242
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:04,053
Sorry about the mess.

243
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:06,346
How bad is it?

244
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:09,683
Ever since Iris got lost here,
things have been mad disorganized.

245
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,227
I mean, night becomes day
in the blink of an eye

246
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:14,813
and just as fast, it's night again.

247
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,566
[sinister music playing]

248
00:14:18,067 --> 00:14:19,151
And now it's getting worse.

249
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:32,289
You see, past, present and future
all exist here simultaneously,

250
00:14:32,373 --> 00:14:34,375
but now the balance is all out of whack.

251
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:39,921
See what I mean?

252
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:45,344
All right, now, stay close to me
because if we get separated...

253
00:14:45,427 --> 00:14:46,427
I could get lost, too.

254
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,470
Or worse,

255
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:49,491
You could get trapped in a dead zone

256
00:14:49,515 --> 00:14:51,517
where time just repeats itself
indefinitely.

257
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:54,060
If that happens,

258
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,522
I'd never get you out.

All right.
Let's ease on down the road, man.

[ethereal music playing]

263
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,118
- We're getting close.
- Yeah.

00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:18,669
[woman 1]...my decision is not...

265
00:15:18,961 --> 00:15:22,673
Oh, one thing, once we find Iris,
let me try and stabilize her first

266
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:23,836
before we do anything else.

267
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:25,402
[woman 2] They need to know
what you've been hiding.

- All right.
- [woman 1] Taylor, don't.

269
00:15:27,511 --> 00:15:29,888
This is my life, my decision.

270
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:31,849
It's not what you think.

271
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:33,016
I know those voices.

272
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,412
[woman 2] They need to know... They need
to know what you've been hiding.

273
00:15:35,436 --> 00:15:36,979
[woman 1] Taylor, don't... Don't.

00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:39,398
This is my life, my decision.

[woman 2] It's not what you think.

276

They need to know what...
You've been hiding.

277
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:45,154
Taylor, don't. Taylor, don't.

278
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:47,448
- This is my life, my decision.
- What is this?

It's a future moment
that's stuck on repeat.

281
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:53,745
They need to know what you've
been hiding. They need to know...

282
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:56,039
They can't move onward and become
part of the past.

283
00:15:56,123 --> 00:15:57,123
My decision.

284
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:58,291
It's not what you think.

285
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,686
They need to know
what you've been hiding.

Taylor, don't.

This is... This is my life.

289
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:05,923
How do we stop it?

290
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:09,678
We can't, not till we find Iris
and fix this whole place.

291
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:14,766
[woman] Help me.
Someone, please help me.

[breath trembling]

293
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:21,647
Help me.

294
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:24,043
Please, I don't know
what's happening to me

295
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,694
and I have to get back to my daughter.

296
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:27,153
Renee.

297
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:31,742
Renee Wazzo, you're Tinya's mom.

298
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:35,078
Yes, do you know where she is?
I have to find her before...

299
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,206
[eerie music playing]

300
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:39,458
She's trapped in here, too,
just like Iris.

301
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,333
We have to find her again.

302
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:43,271
Tinya thought she'd lost her,
but if her mom's alive...

303
00:16:43,295 --> 00:16:45,756
Uh-uh. She's fractured,
just like me and Iris, all right?

304
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,341
We need to stick to why we're here.

305
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:50,344
Deon, we have to help her. Renee
has been lost in all this for weeks.

306
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:54,348
Hey! What we need to do is keep moving
or else Iris is history.

307
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:58,477
She's the key to everything, man.

308
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:00,938
[digital beeping]

309
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:04,273
Iris is close.

310
00:17:05,984 --> 00:17:06,984
I can feel it.

311
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:12,950
Hi, thanks for coming in.

312
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,578
Oh, always happy to tech consult
for Central City's finest.

313
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:21,333
Also, I am in love with the artwork
in here. Is it, uh...

314
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,168
Indigenous, yes.

315
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:25,170
It reminds me of home.

316
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:30,967
Nice.

317
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,972
So I'm guessing this is
our mystery machine.

318
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:38,642
There was an explosion at
a halfway house downtown this morning.

319
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,620
The fire department
secured this from the rubble.

320
00:17:40,644 --> 00:17:42,484
Apparently it was attached
to the water heater.

321
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:43,604
Was anyone hurt?

322
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:45,148
Well, that's the strange part.

323
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,278
C.C.F.D. got a call about
an imminent explosion

324
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:52,823
and by the time they arrived on scene,
everyone had already been evacuated.

325
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:57,035
Then this released an energy wave
that took out the entire building.

326
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:01,498
Damn. Folks could have died.
How many people were living there?

327
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:03,875
Thirty-seven at the time. We got lucky.

328
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:08,338
Halfway house staff have no idea
who led the evacuation,

329
00:18:08,422 --> 00:18:10,048
so this device is our only lead.

330
00:18:10,632 --> 00:18:14,011
I need to know what it is,
what it does and who built it.

331
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:16,888
Well, I'm picking up traces
of radioactive particles.

332
00:18:16,972 --> 00:18:20,350
This thing was packing serious
kinetic energy before it went kaboom.

333
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:23,520
Maybe it's some kind of...

334
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,649
Some kind of, like, EMP.

335
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:31,778
- [suspenseful music playing]
- Whoa.

336
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:34,197
That's quantum coiling.

337
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:37,868
Captain, whoever built this
got mad skills.

338
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,882
[dramatic music playing]

339
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:57,346
Everything all right, Chester?

340
00:18:58,722 --> 00:18:59,722
Huh?

341
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:03,268
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

342
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:07,230
I'm as good as a hydrogen-phat sunrise
over Jupiter. [chuckles nervously]

343
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:09,691
Yeah, I'm...

344
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,238
I'm just, I'm going to take this back to
my workshop and do a full diagnostic,

345
00:19:15,614 --> 00:19:17,717
you know, just to make sure
that everything's totally cool.

346
00:19:17,741 --> 00:19:18,867
If that's fine.

347
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:21,203
Of course, I'll authorize it.

348
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:23,496
Okay.

349
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:26,625
Runk, are you okay?

350
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:29,461
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

351
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:31,546
I'm five by five by the wayside.

352
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:33,590
Just gonna pack up my things.

353
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,722
[digital beeping]

354
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:11,211
Vanya's the Editor-in-Chief?

355
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,463
[digital beeping]

356
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,344
This can't be right. Where is she?

357
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:23,098
[dramatic music playing]

358
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:24,724
What?

359
00:20:27,018 --> 00:20:28,871
Tracing that particle should have
led us right to her.

360
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,605
Yeah, I know, I know, just hold on.

361
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:36,861
[The Flash] Wait.

362
00:20:38,238 --> 00:20:39,238
What are you doing?

363
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:45,412
[suspenseful music playing]

364
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,079
What are you doing?

365
00:20:48,206 --> 00:20:49,206
Deon?

366
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,502
We needed that to find Iris.

367
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:55,380
Sorry, Barr.

368
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:57,882
Gotta bounce.

369
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:00,177
[dramatic music playing]

370
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,806
[gasping]

371
00:21:13,023 --> 00:21:14,023
What the hell?

372
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:29,997
I'm back home again.

373
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:34,001
With no way out.

374
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:36,837
[exhales]

375
00:21:41,885 --> 00:21:46,431
Shark Stadium erupted in cheers
after XS' heroic save,

376
00:21:46,932 --> 00:21:51,019
even without Impulse,
her partner in crime-fighting,

377
00:21:51,102 --> 00:21:54,981
who was too busy partying
to answer his alerts...

378
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:57,400
[burping loudly]

379
00:21:57,484 --> 00:22:00,862
Ugh! You are so disgusting!

380
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:02,696
[exhales deeply]

381
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:08,286
It is clear that XS is the most
daring speedster to appear in years.

382
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:12,499
Good afternoon, Nora West-Allen.
How can I assist you?

383
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:18,088
Gideon, I need another word
for "daring" that isn't too flowery.

384
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:20,507
Of course, I have found 27... 27...

385
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:22,049
Gideon?

386
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:24,093
Gideon?

387
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:26,011
Where'd you go?

388
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:27,179
[voice echoes]

389
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:29,098
[man] Nora.

390
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,600
Nor.

391
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:33,143
Nora.

392
00:22:43,655 --> 00:22:44,655
- Nora.
- [gasps]

393
00:22:46,533 --> 00:22:47,533
Deon?

394
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:49,910
Is that you?

395
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:54,709
[Deon] Barry's trapped.
I can't help him, but you can.

396
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,086
Well... [stuttering] Where?
How am I...

397
00:22:58,503 --> 00:22:59,503
[Deon groans]

398
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:02,506
Uh...

399
00:23:04,885 --> 00:23:06,303
Oh, schrap.

400
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:18,315
[mellow music playing]

401
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:23,111
[Joe] <i>Iris, come on!</i>

402
00:23:23,194 --> 00:23:25,488
<i>This brunch reservation
ain't gonna get any later.</i>

403
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:27,732
[Barry] <i>Joe, don't worry,
I'll make sure we're on time.</i>

404
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:30,493
[Chester] <i>You guys got
any resolutions for 2022?</i>

405
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:33,078
I know mine.

406
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:35,289
More family time.

407
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:49,133
[Nora] <i>Holy schrap! Thank goodness
I found you, Dad!</i>

408
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:53,182
Nora?

409
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,688
This place is messing with me.

410
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:02,275
[panting]

411
00:24:02,692 --> 00:24:03,692
Dad!

412
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:08,365
- Nora?
- Hi.

413
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:11,617
You're really here.

414
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:20,251
[Chester] Oh, my God,
I'm a supervillain.

415
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:22,671
Seriously, that's what
you're worried about?

416
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:27,300
Okay, then where's your meta-hunting
dagger or your purple head fan?

417
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:29,177
No, I'm serious, okay?

418
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,887
I'm the bad guy in all of this.

419
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:32,930
No, you're not.

420
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:37,477
Oh, yeah, Allegra, the microchip that
I found inside that thing was hard-wired

421
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,606
with a one-of-a-kind energy converter
that I created.

422
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:43,626
But you didn't build this one.

423
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:44,985
So, so what?

424
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,571
I still went live with the designs
on my blog last month.

425
00:24:49,197 --> 00:24:50,323
What is this, anyway?

426
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:52,325
[Chester]
It's a quantum coil transformer,

427
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:54,494
which means it's extremely powerful
and dangerous

428
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:55,996
if used for the wrong application.

429
00:24:57,872 --> 00:24:58,872
You know what?

430
00:24:58,873 --> 00:24:59,959
You were right.

431
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:04,045
You're right. I should have never
put my designs online.

432
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:05,462
[scoffs]

433
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:08,967
And never will again.

434
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:14,723
Chuck, you're overreacting.

435
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:16,516
Should have vetted my online posse.

436
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:21,896
Your posse could be anyone,
but, Chuck, you inspire people.

437
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:24,315
You don't send them to the dark side.

438
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:25,941
Think about it.

439
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:28,587
You said there were no casualties
because the person that built this

440
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:30,613
evacuated the place before it detonated.

441
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:35,243
Does that sound like a supervillain
or his accomplice?

442
00:25:36,244 --> 00:25:38,079
No, Allegra, but I...

443
00:25:38,163 --> 00:25:43,209
Then, believe me when I tell you
we're missing the real story.

444
00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:46,337
And you're one of the good ones.

445
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:51,384
So... have a little faith in yourself.

446
00:25:59,142 --> 00:26:01,019
Dad, how are we supposed
to get out of here?

447
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:02,644
I don't know.

448
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:07,150
You shouldn't have followed me here.
You were safer in 2049.

449
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:09,569
But Deon told me you needed my help.

450
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:10,986
Deon?

451
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:14,949
Deon's the reason I'm stuck here.

452
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:18,899
I never should have trusted him.

453
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:22,749
I mean, you and Mom created Deon,

454
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:24,712
- of course you're going to trust him.
- I know.

455
00:26:26,544 --> 00:26:32,342
Joe tried telling me something was off
and I didn't listen.

456
00:26:33,802 --> 00:26:37,722
I was so focused on trying to find
your mom,

457
00:26:39,224 --> 00:26:40,350
I ignored the signs.

458
00:26:44,145 --> 00:26:47,232
She's counting on me and I,
I keep letting her down.

459
00:26:52,946 --> 00:26:54,106
I want to tell you something.

460
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:59,369
I mean, you're going to find out
in a few decades anyways,

461
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:04,582
but you know how
the other Nora was a CSI

462
00:27:04,666 --> 00:27:06,417
and was following in your footsteps?

463
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:10,004
Well, I kind of did the opposite.

464
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:13,258
I'm a reporter.

465
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:17,137
And even though I love it, I...

466
00:27:18,054 --> 00:27:19,305
I'm just starting out.

467
00:27:19,514 --> 00:27:23,184
And sometimes I'm, like,
"How does Mom even do this?"

468
00:27:24,686 --> 00:27:25,686
I'm proud of you.

469
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:29,774
So you're not mad I didn't join C.C.P.D.
like you and Grandpa Joe?

470
00:27:29,858 --> 00:27:30,858
Of course not.

471
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:32,484
I'm just...

472
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:35,238
I'm glad you found a path
that's right for you.

473
00:27:35,697 --> 00:27:36,906
[chuckles nervously]

474
00:27:39,033 --> 00:27:45,123
So, the thing is, is that I'm having
a really hard time

475
00:27:45,206 --> 00:27:47,208
finding my voice as a reporter.

476
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:52,046
But Mom is teaching me
to have faith in myself,

477
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:54,757
and listen to my instincts.

478
00:27:56,134 --> 00:27:59,053
And if she were here right now,
she'd tell you to do the same.

479
00:28:02,765 --> 00:28:06,853
And that everyone loses faith
in themselves sometimes.

480
00:28:06,936 --> 00:28:07,936
Even heroes.

481
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,399
But learning how to keep
believing in yourself,

482
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:14,944
when the whole world
is telling you the opposite,

483
00:28:16,154 --> 00:28:17,405
that's what makes a hero.

484
00:28:20,992 --> 00:28:22,535
You really are your mom's daughter.

485
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:24,078
Well, I'm yours, too.

486
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:28,416
Maybe it's our belief in each other

487
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:31,169
that keeps us connected
just as much as the other stuff.

488
00:28:35,006 --> 00:28:36,174
You're right.

489
00:28:37,425 --> 00:28:38,425
We are connected.

490
00:28:40,678 --> 00:28:41,930
Not just to our family...

491
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:45,642
Me and Iris, to the Still Force.

492
00:28:46,184 --> 00:28:48,519
It's like you said, we created it.

493
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:55,443
Nora, I heard your voice
before you got here.

494
00:28:57,111 --> 00:29:00,406
I think somehow, just for a moment,

495
00:29:01,449 --> 00:29:04,911
I connected to the future
before it became a part of the present.

496
00:29:06,246 --> 00:29:07,247
Or the past.

497
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:10,708
You must already have a piece
of the Still Force inside you.

498
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:12,752
If I can figure out
how to connect to it again,

499
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:14,921
and control it this time,

500
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:17,632
I can get us out of here.

501

[roars]

502
00:29:33,731 --> 00:29:35,900
Okay, I'm ready.

503
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:39,612
Okay. Remember, whatever remnant
of stillness that's inside me

504
00:29:39,696 --> 00:29:40,697
won't be there for long.

[mellow music playing]

506

You look like Uncle Wally when he taught
Bart how to create lightning constructs.

507
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:55,461
This is also how Wally taught me how to
make contact with the other Forces.

508
00:30:02,176 --> 00:30:03,176
Nothing's happening.

509

Focus on Mom's brush.

510
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,030
She still has it in the future.

511
00:30:23,072 --> 00:30:24,282
You can use it as an anchor.

519
00:31:05,615 --> 00:31:09,285
Barry, Nora, what are you two doing
in my living room?

520
00:31:10,161 --> 00:31:13,414
Grandpa Joe, you can see us?

521
00:31:13,623 --> 00:31:14,624
Plain as day.

522
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:19,087
Only you're glowing
with some kind of green light.

523
00:31:21,339 --> 00:31:25,426
Barry, I thought you were
in the Still Force with Deon.

524
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:28,805
Dad, whatever you're doing,
it must be working

525
00:31:28,888 --> 00:31:32,225
because if Grandpa Joe can see us, too,
the present must be stabilizing.

526
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:35,770
Barry, can you hear me?

Grandpa Joe's gone.

531

And so's the brush.

00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:14,267

533
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:23,443
Nora, the temporal stream.

534
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:30,741
I can feel pure Still Force energy
moving through me.

535
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:35,288
I can see the past,

536

present and future all at once.

537
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:42,670
I can see Jesse and Harry.

538
00:32:45,256 --> 00:32:46,674
Cisco and Frost, too.

539
00:32:48,217 --> 00:32:50,219

Actually, don't tell me.

547
00:33:10,907 --> 00:33:12,950
I can already feel the spark
inside me fading.

Schrap! What the hell happened?

558
00:34:07,004 --> 00:34:08,130
It's a temporal barrier.

559
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:11,068
We have to hit it with everything we got
while trying to phase through it.

[groaning]

563
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:50,089
We're caught in a temporal loop.

564
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:52,483
Dad, we're never gonna get out of here.

565
00:34:53,718 --> 00:34:57,221
You see, the past, present and future
all exist here simultaneously.

566
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:58,763
Yes, we are.

567
00:35:00,725 --> 00:35:01,726
This isn't a time loop.

568
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:05,354
It's the Still Force pulling us
back into the past

569
00:35:05,438 --> 00:35:06,897
every time we're about to escape.

570
00:35:07,106 --> 00:35:08,274
Well, why would it do that?

571
00:35:08,858 --> 00:35:11,652
Deon said the past, present
and future all coexist here,

572
00:35:11,736 --> 00:35:15,031
so if we've already escaped,
the only way to stop us...

573
00:35:15,615 --> 00:35:17,408
Is to keep us stuck in the past.

to focus on the moment

of that barrier.

Wait, so you're telling me that you were
able to get out of there

586

because you already knew you had?

I know, it's totally surreal, right?

588
00:36:43,411 --> 00:36:47,331
Barry, is there still a spark of
the Still Force inside of you?

589
00:36:47,415 --> 00:36:51,127
Because if that's the case, then maybe
we can use that to help find Iris.

Not anymore. I tried to tap
into it again as soon as we got back

to get us out of there.

I should have listened to you.

You know, you were right
about everything.

It was like a...

inside her, too, that I could sense.

00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:46,886
You know, to say thanks.

637
00:39:46,969 --> 00:39:49,221
And I could use one myself, actually.

638
00:39:50,097 --> 00:39:51,849
- I would love that.
- Yeah?

639
00:39:53,517 --> 00:39:54,517
[digital beeps]

640
00:39:58,147 --> 00:40:00,357
- [claps]
- [digital beeps]

641
00:40:06,572 --> 00:40:08,115
[digital pinging]

642
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:10,491
[sinister music playing]

643
00:40:26,383 --> 00:40:28,385
- [suspenseful music playing]
- [knock on door]

644
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:33,098
[Mark] It's me. Open up.

645
00:40:34,892 --> 00:40:36,310
Go away.

646
00:40:36,977 --> 00:40:38,145
[sinister music playing]

647
00:40:38,228 --> 00:40:39,897
[crackling]

648
00:40:46,487 --> 00:40:47,487
Sorry about that.

649
00:40:48,656 --> 00:40:50,736
I think you're gonna want to hear
what I have to say.

650
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:52,826
What is wrong with you?

651
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:56,038
First you blow me off and now you
break into my home.

652
00:40:56,789 --> 00:40:58,429
What? I should...
I should call the Flash?

653
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,709
Well, that's your choice.
Just like this one's mine.

654
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:02,961
I'm going to help you.

655
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,548
And don't worry,
I'll pay for a new lock.

656
00:41:07,675 --> 00:41:10,761
Now, you want to know why
I changed my mind?

657
00:41:12,096 --> 00:41:13,097
Because you were right.

658
00:41:13,931 --> 00:41:16,131
Frost and I were just starting
to build a life together.

659
00:41:16,809 --> 00:41:19,496
And thanks to her, I was finally
becoming the man that I didn't even know

660
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,521
I'd always wanted to be.

661
00:41:22,022 --> 00:41:24,733
Losing her broke me,
but losing her twice...

662
00:41:26,193 --> 00:41:27,194
that'd kill me.

663
00:41:28,445 --> 00:41:29,445
That's...

664
00:41:29,947 --> 00:41:31,507
that's why I was so afraid to help you.

665
00:41:32,908 --> 00:41:33,908
So...

666
00:41:35,786 --> 00:41:37,162
If we do this,

667
00:41:38,706 --> 00:41:40,124
I need you to promise me one thing.

668
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:44,919
We won't fail.

669
00:41:48,716 --> 00:41:49,716
We won't.

670
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,592
I promise.

671
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:55,305
[breathing heavily]

672
00:41:55,639 --> 00:41:56,639
Let's get to work.
