1
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:41,794
-Yo.
-Yo.

2
00:00:42,003 --> 00:00:43,254
What up?

3
00:00:43,463 --> 00:00:44,589
Damn, bitch.

4
00:00:49,427 --> 00:00:53,222
-You got something for me?
-Yeah. Yeah, I found them.

5
00:00:57,852 --> 00:01:01,356
-Is this a five or an S?
-Five, yo.

6
00:01:01,564 --> 00:01:03,441
No, wait. S.

7
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:07,528
-No, no. Yeah, five.
-Yeah?

8
00:01:08,863 --> 00:01:12,700
Jesus, how the hell do you spell
"street" wrong? S-T-R-E-A-T?

9
00:01:12,909 --> 00:01:13,951
Hey, man.

10
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,205
I'm slinging mad volume
and fat stacking Benjies.

11
00:01:17,413 --> 00:01:20,166
I can't be all about,
like, spelling and shit.

12
00:01:20,375 --> 00:01:21,876
Hey.

13
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:23,795
So they got names?

14
00:01:24,003 --> 00:01:28,257
Hers is, like, I don't know.
She's just his woman is all.

15
00:01:28,466 --> 00:01:30,343
Him, they call Spooge.

16
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:35,765
Spooge?
Not Mad Dog, not Diesel?

17
00:01:35,973 --> 00:01:37,892
Let me get this straight.
You got jacked...

18
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:40,061
...by a guy named Spooge?

19
00:01:40,269 --> 00:01:41,896
Yo, what's his name matter?

20
00:01:42,105 --> 00:01:45,692
All's I saw was that knife
he stuck in my face, like that big.

21
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:48,528
If you're looking for a reason
not to go do this thing....

22
00:01:48,736 --> 00:01:50,905
-Did I say that?
-Because I'll go do it myself.

23
00:01:51,114 --> 00:01:55,410
-It's just I'm on probation and all.
-Yeah.

24
00:01:56,285 --> 00:01:58,287
So you gonna do it?

25
00:01:59,414 --> 00:02:00,790
Yeah.

26
00:02:00,998 --> 00:02:03,251
Good. Right on.

27
00:02:05,461 --> 00:02:09,674
Because these two,
they need to get got.

28
00:03:39,722 --> 00:03:43,059
Where's my money, bitch?
Where's my money?

29
00:03:43,267 --> 00:03:45,144
Where's my--?

30
00:03:45,353 --> 00:03:50,191
Where's my money, bitch?
Huh, bitch?

31
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,528
Where's my money, bitch?
Oh, that's good.

32
00:03:53,736 --> 00:03:55,321
Where's my money?

33
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,949
Where's my money, bitch?
Bitch, where's my money?

34
00:03:58,157 --> 00:04:00,284
Come on.

35
00:04:04,288 --> 00:04:07,125
I will mess you up.

36
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:10,294
That how you wanna play this?
Your call.

37
00:04:10,503 --> 00:04:13,047
Your funeral, jack.

38
00:04:13,256 --> 00:04:19,053
Hey, do not mess with me.
I will bury you because I'm crazy, yo.

39
00:04:19,262 --> 00:04:22,056
<i>Yeah, mucho loco.</i>

40
00:04:22,265 --> 00:04:25,393
Do not test me.

41
00:04:34,777 --> 00:04:37,530
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

42
00:04:37,739 --> 00:04:40,491
Honey, you blocking the mailbox.

43
00:04:41,576 --> 00:04:43,995
Yeah, sorry. Sorry.

44
00:04:44,203 --> 00:04:46,789
Looks like it's gonna be
a nice day, huh?

45
00:04:46,998 --> 00:04:50,043
Yeah. Yeah. High 70s.

46
00:04:50,251 --> 00:04:54,380
-You have a great day.
-Right on. You too.

47
00:05:10,021 --> 00:05:13,066
God. Shit.

48
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:49,268
Yo, anybody home?

49
00:05:54,065 --> 00:05:55,108
Hello?

50
00:06:50,496 --> 00:06:56,461
<i>Tonight, you will receive
the ultimate mixture of cutlery...</i>

51
00:06:56,669 --> 00:06:58,921
<i>...tonight in the steel knock out.</i>

52
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:02,050
<i>Every phone line jammed.
Eighty-nine dollars on flex pay.</i>

53
00:07:02,258 --> 00:07:04,594
<i>That's 15 easy instalments.</i>

54
00:07:04,802 --> 00:07:07,805
<i>And, folks, the knock out is only--</i>

55
00:07:08,014 --> 00:07:10,767
Hey, yo, is anybody else home?

56
00:07:10,975 --> 00:07:13,561
<i>Now, Terry put this one together--</i>

57
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,356
Where's your folks? They here?

58
00:07:16,564 --> 00:07:18,483
<i>--and I'm here to tell you--</i>

59
00:07:18,691 --> 00:07:23,863
<i>Yeah, guys,
you might wanna put up like a....</i>

60
00:07:24,655 --> 00:07:25,907
<i>Already done it.</i>

61
00:07:26,115 --> 00:07:28,242
<i>Tonight, folks....</i>

62
00:07:36,626 --> 00:07:38,586
<i>Do you realise how long it's been...</i>

63
00:07:38,795 --> 00:07:43,383
<i>...since we've offered this sword
in this set?</i>

64
00:07:43,591 --> 00:07:49,931
<i>Much less the watashi and tanto
as a bonus in the deal.</i>

65
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:51,808
<i>It's no wonder--</i>

66
00:07:52,016 --> 00:07:55,103
<i>It is no wonder so many of you
are on the line right now--</i>

67
00:07:55,311 --> 00:07:56,437
What's your name?

68
00:07:56,646 --> 00:07:59,941
<i>I'm gonna count this as one.
Even though there are three, I'm--</i>

69
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:03,611
My name's Diesel.

70
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,780
<i>--eleven, 12, 13--</i>

71
00:08:07,198 --> 00:08:10,118
<i>--sixteen, 17, 18, 19....</i>

72
00:08:10,326 --> 00:08:12,870
Yo, don't you wanna watch
something other than this?

73
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:16,708
<i>Like, I don't know, Mister Rogers'?</i>

74
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:21,087
<i>Imagine this plan,
this set in your own home.</i>

75
00:08:21,295 --> 00:08:24,257
<i>Folks, custom pieces--</i>

76
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:33,891
<i>Well, needless to say,
I've made a pretty good mess...</i>

77
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,352
<i>...but there's a reason for that.</i>

78
00:08:36,561 --> 00:08:41,816
<i>Just because these are under $10,
don't let anybody kid you.</i>

79
00:08:42,025 --> 00:08:45,653
<i>These knives possess edges like....</i>

80
00:08:54,245 --> 00:08:58,750
So when are your folks
coming home?

81
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:03,338
Your dad, Mr. Spooge?
When is he getting back?

82
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:08,176
I'm hungry.

83
00:09:13,556 --> 00:09:15,350
<i>Hey there, you three.</i>

84
00:09:15,558 --> 00:09:18,353
<i>Just wanted to wish Walt
a good first day back.</i>

85
00:09:18,561 --> 00:09:23,524
<i>We'll be thinking about you
teaching valences and covalences....</i>

86
00:09:23,733 --> 00:09:26,861
<i>Okay, that's all I officially
remembered. Good luck.</i>

87
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,906
<i>Skyler, give me a call
when you get a chance.</i>

88
00:09:33,076 --> 00:09:35,953
<i>Hi, Walt and Skyler.
This is Gretchen Schwartz...</i>

89
00:09:36,162 --> 00:09:38,206
<i>...calling to say hello.</i>

90
00:09:38,414 --> 00:09:41,542
<i>I'm down from Santa Fe today
and I was thinking about you both...</i>

91
00:09:41,751 --> 00:09:43,002
<i>...hoping everything's well.</i>

92
00:09:43,211 --> 00:09:46,297
<i>I tried Walt's cell, and it said
the number had been disconnected...</i>

93
00:09:46,506 --> 00:09:49,008
<i>...so I'm just hoping
that everything's okay.</i>

94
00:09:49,217 --> 00:09:51,386
<i>Call me if you can,
whenever's convenient.</i>

95
00:09:54,097 --> 00:09:56,224
<i>-Hello?
-Oh, hi, Gretchen.</i>

96
00:09:56,432 --> 00:09:59,894
<i>This is Skyler White.
Am I catching you at a bad time?</i>

97
00:10:00,103 --> 00:10:02,230
No. No, not at all.

98
00:10:02,438 --> 00:10:04,899
It's so good to hear from you.
How is everybody?

99
00:10:05,108 --> 00:10:06,484
<i>We're very well, thank you.</i>

100
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,197
Walt is actually at work today.
It's his first day back at work...

101
00:10:11,406 --> 00:10:14,742
<i>...and he lost his cell phone
quite a while back.</i>

102
00:10:14,951 --> 00:10:16,828
And I really hope
we didn't worry you.

103
00:10:17,036 --> 00:10:19,997
No, no. I'm just so glad to hear
that everybody's fine.

104
00:10:20,206 --> 00:10:21,582
That's wonderful.

105
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:26,629
Gretchen, I'm so very,
very long overdue in telling you this...

106
00:10:26,838 --> 00:10:30,758
...and I have to take Walt at his word
that he's been passing it along for me.

107
00:10:30,967 --> 00:10:33,219
<i>I mean, he's been so adamant...</i>

108
00:10:33,428 --> 00:10:37,098
...about wanting to handle this
whole thing by himself, and....

109
00:10:37,306 --> 00:10:40,101
But I have picked up the phone
about a hundred times. I just--

110
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:45,732
<i>-What? What is it?
-I can't...</i>

111
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:49,444
...begin to thank you and Elliott
for what you've done.

112
00:10:50,987 --> 00:10:53,906
<i>The money for Walt's treatment,
it's just....</i>

113
00:10:55,658 --> 00:10:57,744
It saved us.

114
00:11:00,663 --> 00:11:02,832
I don't know if I....

115
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:05,793
Walt keeps saying,
"Don't bother them. It's no big deal."

116
00:11:06,002 --> 00:11:08,212
But it is a big deal. Yeah.

117
00:11:08,421 --> 00:11:11,883
To me. And to all of us.

118
00:11:12,091 --> 00:11:14,761
So I just...

119
00:11:14,969 --> 00:11:19,223
...finally wanted to say thank you.

120
00:11:23,811 --> 00:11:25,229
<i>Anyway....</i>

121
00:11:26,773 --> 00:11:27,857
End of speech.

122
00:11:28,066 --> 00:11:30,735
So I do--
I hope we get to see you soon.

123
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:35,823
Truly, anytime you're in town,
anytime at all, is good for us.

124
00:11:36,824 --> 00:11:40,870
<i>-How about this afternoon?
-Yeah, okay.</i>

125
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:47,168
Monoalkenes, diolefins...

126
00:11:47,377 --> 00:11:50,963
...trienes, polyenes.

127
00:11:51,172 --> 00:11:54,634
I mean, the nomenclature alone
is enough to make your head spin.

128
00:11:54,842 --> 00:11:56,886
But when you start
to feel overwhelmed...

129
00:11:57,095 --> 00:11:59,347
...and you will...

130
00:11:59,555 --> 00:12:03,685
...just keep in mind
that one element...

131
00:12:03,893 --> 00:12:06,145
...carbon.

132
00:12:06,354 --> 00:12:09,857
Carbon is at the centre of it all.

133
00:12:10,066 --> 00:12:13,820
There is no life without carbon.

134
00:12:14,028 --> 00:12:16,531
Nowhere that we know of
in the universe.

135
00:12:16,739 --> 00:12:23,663
Everything that lives, lived,
will live, carbon.

136
00:12:25,498 --> 00:12:26,499
Carmen is carbon.

137
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:31,671
Sorry. Assistant Principal Carmen.
Did you...?

138
00:12:33,006 --> 00:12:34,882
No. Okay.

139
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:38,511
I like to think of it....

140
00:12:39,554 --> 00:12:43,016
I like to think that the diamond...

141
00:12:43,224 --> 00:12:45,268
...and the woman
who wears it on her finger...

142
00:12:45,476 --> 00:12:48,688
...are both formed
from the same stuff.

143
00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:54,861
Or, say, the diamond
and the man who invented it.

144
00:12:56,237 --> 00:12:58,406
That got your attention, right?

145
00:12:58,614 --> 00:13:02,326
The man who invented the diamond.
All right.

146
00:13:03,661 --> 00:13:07,623
H. Tracy Hall.
Write this name down.

147
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:12,754
Dr. Hall invented
the first reproducible process...

148
00:13:12,962 --> 00:13:15,381
..for making synthetic diamonds.

149
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,759
I mean, this is way back in the '50s.

150
00:13:17,967 --> 00:13:23,139
Now, today, synthetic diamonds
are used in oil drilling...

151
00:13:23,348 --> 00:13:28,061
...electronics,
multi-billion-dollar industries.

152
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:31,856
At the time, Dr. Hall
worked for General Electric.

153
00:13:32,065 --> 00:13:37,028
And he made them a fortune.
I mean, incalculable.

154
00:13:39,947 --> 00:13:44,452
You wanna know
how GE rewarded Dr. Hall?

155
00:13:45,995 --> 00:13:49,957
A $10 U.S. Savings Bond.

156
00:14:01,386 --> 00:14:03,096
Anyway....

157
00:14:04,013 --> 00:14:07,433
A savings bond
printed on carbon-based paper...

158
00:14:07,642 --> 00:14:09,185
...paid to a carbon-based man....

159
00:14:09,394 --> 00:14:15,066
...for something
he made out of carbon.

160
00:14:17,026 --> 00:14:18,778
<i>It's so nice to have you back with us.</i>

161
00:14:20,196 --> 00:14:22,824
You're looking great, by the way.

162
00:14:23,032 --> 00:14:27,537
A little skinnier,
which is definitely no tragedy.

163
00:14:27,745 --> 00:14:30,999
-And then there's the hair thing.
-I actually like that.

164
00:14:31,207 --> 00:14:33,501
That's a great look for you.

165
00:14:34,961 --> 00:14:40,925
-But you're feeling good?
-Oh, absolutely. Hundred percent.

166
00:14:41,134 --> 00:14:43,302
It's....

167
00:14:43,511 --> 00:14:44,971
I'm glad to be back at work.

168
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:50,059
I'm glad to.... You know,
I'm happy to be here. Really.

169
00:14:50,268 --> 00:14:52,270
We're happy too.

170
00:14:53,771 --> 00:14:56,149
And I just....

171
00:14:58,026 --> 00:15:02,321
Yeah. It's good. It's great.

172
00:15:05,867 --> 00:15:09,370
Is everything okay?

173
00:15:10,371 --> 00:15:15,752
Just please feel comfortable
coming to me...

174
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:20,715
...with any problems, any issues.
Anything at all.

175
00:15:20,923 --> 00:15:23,843
You know, completely confidential.

176
00:15:24,052 --> 00:15:25,970
Okay?

177
00:15:29,932 --> 00:15:33,227
-See you tomorrow, Flynn.
-See you, Jeffrey.

178
00:15:34,604 --> 00:15:36,981
Oh, man.

179
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,412
Let me see it.

180
00:15:52,955 --> 00:15:56,501
-Dad, let me see it.
-Don't worry about it.

181
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:03,049
Hey, let's go.

182
00:16:35,832 --> 00:16:39,127
<i>Forty-eight dollars,
that's the original price....</i>

183
00:16:41,421 --> 00:16:42,463
Hey.

184
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:46,592
Peekaboo.

185
00:16:51,055 --> 00:16:52,140
No?

186
00:16:57,145 --> 00:16:58,563
Peekaboo.

187
00:17:02,859 --> 00:17:04,152
Oh, man.

188
00:17:06,195 --> 00:17:09,323
Oh, my hand is cramping up!

189
00:17:11,701 --> 00:17:14,412
Oh, my God. Here, here, here.

190
00:17:15,246 --> 00:17:17,999
Now, I don't know.
If you want your hand to stop aching...

191
00:17:18,207 --> 00:17:21,085
...I gave you advice,
take it or leave it.

192
00:17:23,004 --> 00:17:29,302
Okay, you stay right here, all right?
Okay? I mean it.

193
00:17:43,066 --> 00:17:44,275
-Shut up!
-You shut up.

194
00:17:44,484 --> 00:17:46,903
-You shut up, you--
-You shut up!

195
00:17:47,111 --> 00:17:49,822
-You're the one who dropped it.
-I didn't drop it.

196
00:17:50,031 --> 00:17:51,032
I didn't drop--

197
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,451
-Shit! You dropped it.
-Shut the hell up about it.

198
00:17:53,659 --> 00:17:55,036
-You shut up!
-You shut up.

199
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:00,708
Get up.

200
00:18:02,669 --> 00:18:06,381
Shut up. Shut up! Both of you.

201
00:18:25,608 --> 00:18:30,029
-You know who might have done it?
-I have an idea.

202
00:18:33,074 --> 00:18:35,410
Well, here's what I think.

203
00:18:35,618 --> 00:18:40,081
You ID them, and then together,
you and I put a bag over their heads...

204
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:45,461
...we tie them up, drive them way out
into the desert, strip them naked...

205
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:51,050
...then bury them up to their necks
in a huge mound of fire ants.

206
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,721
Saw it in an old Western.

207
00:18:58,141 --> 00:18:59,809
You with me?

208
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:04,939
Scorpions?

209
00:19:07,483 --> 00:19:10,111
Scorpions are good.

210
00:19:10,528 --> 00:19:12,405
Yeah.

211
00:19:20,038 --> 00:19:21,289
Nice.

212
00:19:34,969 --> 00:19:38,973
Damn, Dad. Check it out.

213
00:19:39,182 --> 00:19:41,768
Who is this?

214
00:20:00,787 --> 00:20:03,665
So this is Walter Jr., or Flynn.

215
00:20:03,873 --> 00:20:06,000
He likes to go by Flynn these days.

216
00:20:06,209 --> 00:20:08,586
-Mom.
-What? I'm just offering the choice.

217
00:20:08,795 --> 00:20:11,297
This is Mrs. Schwartz,
whom you've heard so much about.

218
00:20:11,506 --> 00:20:14,467
-Very nice to meet you, Flynn.
-Nice to meet you too.

219
00:20:14,676 --> 00:20:15,843
Oh, Walt.

220
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,472
Look who's here.

221
00:20:19,681 --> 00:20:20,682
-Gretchen.
-Hi.

222
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:23,935
Always nice to see you.
What a nice surprise.

223
00:20:24,143 --> 00:20:26,688
Look at you. You're looking good.

224
00:20:26,896 --> 00:20:28,898
Though a bald head
is a bit of a shocker.

225
00:20:29,107 --> 00:20:30,608
I know it was for me.

226
00:20:30,817 --> 00:20:34,404
Oh, you have a good-shaped head.

227
00:20:34,612 --> 00:20:35,988
-May I?
-Oh, sure.

228
00:20:36,197 --> 00:20:39,409
-For good luck, right?
-Exactly. Here's hoping.

229
00:20:39,617 --> 00:20:41,244
-We could use some of that.
-Yeah.

230
00:20:41,452 --> 00:20:45,707
Mrs. Schwartz, thank you so much
for what you've done for my dad.

231
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:51,713
-It was a really good thing.
-You're very welcome.

232
00:20:51,921 --> 00:20:55,049
-We're gonna find a way to repay you.
-No, no, no.

233
00:20:55,258 --> 00:20:58,386
We don't wanna ever hear that.

234
00:20:59,762 --> 00:21:02,724
You know, I hate to say it...

235
00:21:02,932 --> 00:21:06,060
...but I really need to get going.

236
00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:07,895
Oh, that's too bad.

237
00:21:08,104 --> 00:21:10,148
-You can't stay for dinner?
-I wish I could...

238
00:21:10,356 --> 00:21:13,693
...but unfortunately,
I have to try to beat the traffic.

239
00:21:13,901 --> 00:21:14,902
Okay. Okay.

240
00:21:15,111 --> 00:21:19,907
Well, I hope we get a chance
to catch up real soon.

241
00:21:20,116 --> 00:21:21,409
Yeah, hopefully.

242
00:21:21,617 --> 00:21:24,454
Gretchen, your purse.

243
00:21:25,955 --> 00:21:28,541
Well, good to see you.

244
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:33,504
And you and Elliott
are welcome anytime. Really.

245
00:21:34,547 --> 00:21:38,009
And I, for one, am gonna be
much better about keeping in touch.

246
00:21:38,217 --> 00:21:40,345
-It's so good to see you.
-And you.

247
00:21:40,553 --> 00:21:44,474
-Nice meeting you.
-Likewise.

248
00:21:44,682 --> 00:21:48,561
-Okay. Bye, now.
-Drive safely.

249
00:21:50,146 --> 00:21:53,191
You know, what am I thinking?
I should walk her to her car. Really.

250
00:21:53,399 --> 00:21:55,234
I'll be right back.

251
00:21:59,113 --> 00:22:00,740
Gretchen.

252
00:22:01,741 --> 00:22:02,742
Hey.

253
00:22:07,705 --> 00:22:10,291
-Hey.
-Hey yourself.

254
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,335
What did you...?

255
00:22:14,879 --> 00:22:16,714
We need to talk.

256
00:22:16,923 --> 00:22:20,968
Can you not do or say
anything to anyone until then?

257
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:25,223
Please. Please.

258
00:22:39,445 --> 00:22:44,075
Where's my money, bitch?
I ain't gonna keep asking nice!

259
00:22:44,283 --> 00:22:48,413
Yo, all right? I want my money
and my dope. Come on!

260
00:22:48,621 --> 00:22:51,958
-I just wanna say, man--
-What? What do you wanna say?

261
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:53,668
I just wanna go on record, man.

262
00:22:53,876 --> 00:22:57,255
You hit me really, really hard, man.
I think I'm seeing double.

263
00:22:57,463 --> 00:22:59,757
-Maybe I need to go see a hospital.
-Shut up!

264
00:22:59,966 --> 00:23:01,759
Jesus.

265
00:23:01,968 --> 00:23:05,304
-Serious, I might have a concussion.
-Don't fall asleep, baby.

266
00:23:05,513 --> 00:23:07,432
-Subdural hematoma.
-Don't fall asleep.

267
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,184
Shut up.

268
00:23:10,935 --> 00:23:12,520
All right. Empty your pockets.

269
00:23:12,729 --> 00:23:15,106
Turn them out,
everything on the table.

270
00:23:15,314 --> 00:23:16,524
Do it!

271
00:23:21,487 --> 00:23:23,031
All right, turn around.

272
00:23:23,239 --> 00:23:24,490
Turn around.

273
00:23:24,991 --> 00:23:27,285
Turn out your back pockets.
Come on.

274
00:23:32,332 --> 00:23:36,044
All right. Shoes. Give them here.

275
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:51,517
I told you, Diesel,
we ain't holding any--

276
00:23:51,726 --> 00:23:53,394
-We shot it all.
-Yeah?

277
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,898
-Shot an ounce in a day and a half?
-Yeah.

278
00:23:57,106 --> 00:23:59,233
All right, tell you what.

279
00:23:59,442 --> 00:24:03,237
Both of you
pull it out of your butts right now...

280
00:24:03,446 --> 00:24:07,408
...or I grab a flashlight and
some pliers and go exploring.

281
00:24:07,617 --> 00:24:09,535
What's it gonna be, yo? Come on.

282
00:24:12,955 --> 00:24:14,749
There you go.

283
00:24:17,627 --> 00:24:19,962
All right, come on.
On the table.

284
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,175
All right, so, what, you hold the
crystal and she holds the H, huh?

285
00:24:24,384 --> 00:24:25,426
Division of labour.

286
00:24:27,095 --> 00:24:30,807
All right,
there's maybe an 8 ball here.

287
00:24:31,015 --> 00:24:33,101
Where's the rest of my meth?

288
00:24:33,309 --> 00:24:35,728
Yo, for real? She up and lost it, yo.

289
00:24:35,937 --> 00:24:37,814
-You shut up.
-You shut up, skank.

290
00:24:38,022 --> 00:24:40,858
Shut up! Shut up! Stop it!

291
00:24:41,359 --> 00:24:44,737
This really isn't getting any better,
man. It's turning cranial.

292
00:24:44,946 --> 00:24:48,449
Oh, yeah? You see this gun?
It's got five bullets.

293
00:24:48,658 --> 00:24:51,828
One for each kneecap,
plus an extra round for your cranial...

294
00:24:52,036 --> 00:24:54,831
...for being such a pussy.

295
00:24:57,333 --> 00:25:00,795
Hey. Hey, baby.

296
00:25:01,004 --> 00:25:04,882
Come here, baby.
Come here, baby.

297
00:25:10,179 --> 00:25:11,848
All right.

298
00:25:12,056 --> 00:25:15,476
You two are never
getting high again.

299
00:25:15,685 --> 00:25:18,271
I will make it my life's mission.

300
00:25:18,479 --> 00:25:21,149
Not another needle,
not another ball...

301
00:25:21,357 --> 00:25:25,403
...not one toke,
not till I get what's mine.

302
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,657
Yeah, we got you covered,
man, sure.

303
00:25:29,866 --> 00:25:33,036
It just so happens we got
your money, man, plus interest.

304
00:25:33,244 --> 00:25:34,746
You're damn right, plus interest.

305
00:25:34,954 --> 00:25:37,457
-Where?
-Back yard.

306
00:25:37,665 --> 00:25:40,293
Yo, right hand to the man, dog.
Back yard. Go check it out.

307
00:25:40,501 --> 00:25:43,671
-Hurting. Painful.
-Hey, hey, hey.

308
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:47,592
Me and your old man,
we're just playing a game, all right?

309
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,803
Hey, don't move.

310
00:25:54,098 --> 00:25:55,850
Come on.

311
00:25:58,269 --> 00:25:59,520
See?

312
00:25:59,729 --> 00:26:02,982
Me and the slit just boosted it, yo.
She's like a ant, man.

313
00:26:03,191 --> 00:26:06,027
She can lift a hundred times
her own weight. For real.

314
00:26:06,235 --> 00:26:08,029
What am I supposed to do with this?

315
00:26:08,237 --> 00:26:11,199
Help me break it open.
Take out the money, get paid.

316
00:26:11,407 --> 00:26:13,701
Get high.

317
00:26:17,997 --> 00:26:19,582
Yo, that's my bank.

318
00:26:19,791 --> 00:26:22,001
So? It's FIDC insured, yo.

319
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:24,712
It's a victimless crime.

320
00:26:25,421 --> 00:26:26,464
<i>Where did you get this?</i>

321
00:26:27,882 --> 00:26:28,966
<i>Bodega. Way across town.</i>

322
00:26:29,175 --> 00:26:31,678
<i>In, out, like, bam.
Went smooth as silk, yo.</i>

323
00:26:32,261 --> 00:26:35,181
<i>What, nobody saw you?
What about witnesses, dumbass?</i>

324
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,558
<i>We roll like the breeze, for real.</i>

325
00:26:37,767 --> 00:26:40,103
<i>All we did,
we just walked in all smooth-like.</i>

326
00:26:40,311 --> 00:26:42,563
<i>-Nobody even noticed.
-Nobody noticed?</i>

327
00:26:42,772 --> 00:26:47,443
<i>-For real?
-I'm telling you, victimless crime.</i>

328
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,660
Oh, my God.

329
00:26:59,245 --> 00:27:01,747
Jesus. Come on already.

330
00:27:01,956 --> 00:27:05,418
-It's about to give, man. I'm sensing it.
-You don't know what you're doing.

331
00:27:05,626 --> 00:27:08,045
I thought you told me
you boosted, like, six of these.

332
00:27:08,254 --> 00:27:10,423
Yeah. Boosted.

333
00:27:10,631 --> 00:27:12,591
It's not like he ever got one open.

334
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,593
At least I got persistence.

335
00:27:14,802 --> 00:27:17,680
The law of averages,
lucky number seven.

336
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:22,435
-Don't listen to that skank.
-Stop calling me that.

337
00:27:23,185 --> 00:27:24,729
I ain't no skank!

338
00:27:24,937 --> 00:27:27,273
-Skank, skank, skank--
-Hey, hey, hey.

339
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:28,983
Sit, sit.

340
00:27:29,191 --> 00:27:33,279
All right, I swear to God
I will shoot you both in the face.

341
00:27:34,113 --> 00:27:36,073
Now, chill.

342
00:27:36,657 --> 00:27:39,577
You, get that thing open.

343
00:27:39,785 --> 00:27:43,956
You sit the hell down,
and no throwing things.

344
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:50,421
Where's the kid?

345
00:27:52,006 --> 00:27:53,466
The kid. The little kid!

346
00:27:53,674 --> 00:27:56,635
What are you asking me for?

347
00:28:12,902 --> 00:28:16,489
I got you now, bitch. I got you now.

348
00:28:16,697 --> 00:28:17,948
Didn't see that coming, huh?

349
00:28:22,662 --> 00:28:23,954
What kind of mother are you?

350
00:28:25,373 --> 00:28:28,876
How about you feed the kid a decent
meal every now and then, huh?

351
00:28:29,085 --> 00:28:31,629
Give him a bath.
Put some baby powder on him.

352
00:28:31,837 --> 00:28:34,507
Get him some decent TV to watch.
I mean, what is this shit?

353
00:28:34,715 --> 00:28:36,175
Are you serious?

354
00:28:36,384 --> 00:28:39,512
You give me one hit, and I'll be
any kind of mother that you want.

355
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,097
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah, Diesel...

356
00:28:41,305 --> 00:28:44,183
...this thing would go easier
if we all had a little taste, man.

357
00:28:46,352 --> 00:28:47,770
Get out of the way.

358
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,606
Get out of the way!

359
00:29:06,455 --> 00:29:07,832
So you didn't tell anyone.

360
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,419
-You didn't tell Elliott.
-Not yet.

361
00:29:12,211 --> 00:29:15,881
-Well, what does that mean?
-That means exactly what it means.

362
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:19,385
That's a determination
I have yet to make.

363
00:29:22,054 --> 00:29:25,391
All right, fair enough.
I can appreciate that.

364
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:26,726
All right.

365
00:29:26,934 --> 00:29:32,231
First let me say, I very much
regret involving you in this.

366
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,400
This was....

367
00:29:34,608 --> 00:29:38,446
This entire thing was unfortunate.

368
00:29:38,654 --> 00:29:40,906
Unfortunate?

369
00:29:42,283 --> 00:29:45,453
And I apologise deeply.

370
00:29:46,037 --> 00:29:47,580
Thank you.

371
00:29:49,123 --> 00:29:52,418
Now please tell me why you did it.

372
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:58,007
That's not really at issue here.

373
00:29:58,341 --> 00:30:02,261
Well, you told me your insurance
was covering it. Was that a lie?

374
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:07,600
If you won't take our money,
and your insurance isn't covering it...

375
00:30:07,808 --> 00:30:09,268
...how are you paying for it?

376
00:30:09,477 --> 00:30:14,231
This is not an issue
that concerns you, Gretchen, okay?

377
00:30:14,857 --> 00:30:17,610
Excuse me, Walt. It does concern me.
It concerns me greatly.

378
00:30:17,818 --> 00:30:20,529
You tell your wife and son...

379
00:30:20,738 --> 00:30:22,948
...that I am paying
for your cancer treatment.

380
00:30:23,157 --> 00:30:25,785
Why are you doing this?

381
00:30:27,578 --> 00:30:30,456
I will clear this up with them.

382
00:30:30,665 --> 00:30:33,876
The look on Skyler's face,
she's sitting there, tears in her eyes...

383
00:30:34,085 --> 00:30:35,711
...thanking me for saving your life.

384
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:40,007
-Why would you do that to her?
-As I said, I will clear this up.

385
00:30:40,216 --> 00:30:44,929
Just please allow me to do this
in my own way, in my own time.

386
00:30:45,137 --> 00:30:46,138
All right?

387
00:30:46,347 --> 00:30:48,974
I will explain
the whole thing to them.

388
00:30:49,183 --> 00:30:51,644
And while you're at it,
explain it to me.

389
00:30:54,563 --> 00:30:56,899
I don't owe you an explanation.

390
00:30:57,108 --> 00:31:00,736
I owe you an apology,
and I have apologised.

391
00:31:00,945 --> 00:31:03,739
I am very sorry, Gretchen.

392
00:31:03,948 --> 00:31:06,909
There. I've apologised twice now.

393
00:31:07,118 --> 00:31:09,996
I'm humbly sorry.

394
00:31:10,204 --> 00:31:11,664
Three times.

395
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,833
Let me just get this straight.

396
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:16,419
Elliott and I offer
to pay for your treatment...

397
00:31:16,627 --> 00:31:18,087
...no strings attached.

398
00:31:18,295 --> 00:31:20,506
An offer which still stands,
by the way.

399
00:31:20,715 --> 00:31:23,384
And you turn us down out of pride,
whatever...

400
00:31:23,592 --> 00:31:28,014
...and then you tell your wife that in
fact we are paying for your treatment.

401
00:31:28,222 --> 00:31:30,057
Without our knowledge,
against our will...

402
00:31:30,266 --> 00:31:32,268
...you involve us in your lie.

403
00:31:32,476 --> 00:31:38,357
And you sit here and tell me
that that is none of my business?

404
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:44,322
Yeah.
That's pretty much the size of it.

405
00:31:46,824 --> 00:31:49,201
What happened to you?

406
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:54,206
Really, Walt.

407
00:31:54,415 --> 00:31:56,208
What happened?

408
00:31:56,417 --> 00:31:59,211
Because this isn't you.

409
00:32:02,256 --> 00:32:06,135
What would you know about me,
Gretchen?

410
00:32:06,344 --> 00:32:10,765
What would your presumption
about me be, exactly?

411
00:32:10,973 --> 00:32:13,309
That I should go begging
for your charity?

412
00:32:14,018 --> 00:32:17,355
And you waving
your chequebook around...

413
00:32:17,563 --> 00:32:21,108
...like some magic wand
is gonna make me forget...

414
00:32:21,317 --> 00:32:22,443
...how you and Elliott--

415
00:32:22,652 --> 00:32:25,738
How you and Elliott cut me out?

416
00:32:25,946 --> 00:32:27,740
What? That can't be how you see it.

417
00:32:27,948 --> 00:32:31,410
It was my hard work, my research,
and you and Elliott make millions off it.

418
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:33,537
That cannot be how you see it.

419
00:32:33,746 --> 00:32:35,665
-Good. That's beautifully done.
-You left--

420
00:32:35,873 --> 00:32:37,667
You are always
the picture of innocence.

421
00:32:37,875 --> 00:32:40,419
-You left me.
-The picture of innocence.

422
00:32:40,628 --> 00:32:44,173
-Just sweetness and light.
-You left me.

423
00:32:44,965 --> 00:32:46,258
Newport, 4th of July weekend.

424
00:32:46,467 --> 00:32:49,595
You and my father and my brothers
and I go up to our room...

425
00:32:49,804 --> 00:32:52,390
...and you're packing your bags,
barely talking.

426
00:32:52,598 --> 00:32:55,267
What? Did I dream all of that?

427
00:32:55,476 --> 00:32:57,978
That's your excuse...

428
00:32:58,187 --> 00:33:00,981
...to build your little empire
on my work?

429
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,442
How can you say that to me?
You walked away.

430
00:33:03,651 --> 00:33:06,696
You abandoned us, me, Elliott.

431
00:33:06,904 --> 00:33:09,615
Little rich girl
just adding to your millions.

432
00:33:14,036 --> 00:33:17,623
I don't even know what to say to you.

433
00:33:18,332 --> 00:33:21,377
I don't even know where to begin.

434
00:33:26,674 --> 00:33:32,013
I feel so sorry for you, Walt.

435
00:33:34,598 --> 00:33:37,143
Fuck you.

436
00:34:12,762 --> 00:34:14,680
Hey.

437
00:34:17,725 --> 00:34:21,270
Hey, little man, you hungry?

438
00:34:35,076 --> 00:34:36,619
Hey.

439
00:34:59,433 --> 00:35:02,311
Man. No, no, what are you doing?

440
00:35:04,146 --> 00:35:05,189
No, what are you doing?

441
00:35:07,608 --> 00:35:09,610
Spooge, I got him, I got him.

442
00:35:09,819 --> 00:35:11,487
Baby, get up and help me.

443
00:35:11,696 --> 00:35:15,241
Call me a bad mother.
I'll show you a bad mother, bitch.

444
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:17,368
Get up, damn it! Get our dope!

445
00:35:21,247 --> 00:35:22,331
Bedtime.

446
00:35:26,085 --> 00:35:28,629
Here we go. Oh, yeah.

447
00:35:33,426 --> 00:35:36,262
Who's the big tough guy now, huh?
Is that you?

448
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,347
Is that you? You're the big man?

449
00:35:38,556 --> 00:35:41,225
Try and hit me now, bitch.
Try and hit me now!

450
00:35:41,434 --> 00:35:44,061
Try and hit me now, bitch.

451
00:36:15,801 --> 00:36:17,094
Oh, hey.

452
00:36:17,303 --> 00:36:19,722
Should I ask where you've been?

453
00:36:20,848 --> 00:36:22,558
Never mind.

454
00:36:22,767 --> 00:36:25,770
We're long past that, I suppose.

455
00:36:26,854 --> 00:36:28,689
Skyler.

456
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:38,240
Gretchen called about an hour ago.

457
00:36:48,668 --> 00:36:50,336
Walt.

458
00:36:51,212 --> 00:36:53,506
We need to talk.

459
00:37:05,267 --> 00:37:07,144
Just say it.

460
00:37:16,946 --> 00:37:19,824
They're cutting off the money.

461
00:37:31,585 --> 00:37:34,547
What did she say, exactly?

462
00:37:36,841 --> 00:37:41,887
Not much. It was abrupt.

463
00:37:42,096 --> 00:37:45,933
She said something like:

464
00:37:47,435 --> 00:37:51,355
"I'm sorry to have to do this...

465
00:37:51,564 --> 00:37:56,152
...but Elliott and I can no longer
continue to pay for Walt's treatment.

466
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:59,447
I wish you the very best."

467
00:38:01,198 --> 00:38:03,492
And that was it.

468
00:38:09,165 --> 00:38:10,750
Yeah.

469
00:38:11,417 --> 00:38:15,671
I mean, she sounded apologetic.
I guess.

470
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,798
It was quick.
She got right off the phone.

471
00:38:18,007 --> 00:38:20,509
I was so stunned, but....

472
00:38:20,718 --> 00:38:25,639
I called her back
and she didn't pick up.

473
00:38:31,604 --> 00:38:36,859
So, what do you know about this?

474
00:38:39,528 --> 00:38:44,617
I mean, she and I had a perfectly nice
visit this afternoon...

475
00:38:44,825 --> 00:38:48,454
...and then you come home
and she's in a big hurry to leave...

476
00:38:48,663 --> 00:38:51,957
...and then the two of you
are talking in the driveway.

477
00:38:56,003 --> 00:38:57,755
Walt.

478
00:38:58,422 --> 00:39:00,466
What do you know that I don't?

479
00:39:05,429 --> 00:39:07,807
Where were you tonight?

480
00:39:09,767 --> 00:39:11,268
I drove up to Santa Fe.

481
00:39:13,938 --> 00:39:15,189
I was with Gretchen.

482
00:39:15,398 --> 00:39:18,651
Well, Gretchen and Elliott.

483
00:39:19,735 --> 00:39:24,407
She just couldn't bring
herself to tell you today.

484
00:39:24,615 --> 00:39:27,493
I mean, she couldn't tell me,
either, really.

485
00:39:27,702 --> 00:39:30,830
I mean, there was
a lot of hemming and hawing...

486
00:39:31,038 --> 00:39:32,915
...and beating around the bush--

487
00:39:33,124 --> 00:39:37,003
Okay, what--? Tell us what?

488
00:39:38,754 --> 00:39:40,506
Well....

489
00:39:42,466 --> 00:39:43,509
There was a lot of...

490
00:39:44,802 --> 00:39:47,179
...business phraseology
being tossed around.

491
00:39:47,388 --> 00:39:52,935
You know, things like "cash-poor"
and "leveraged"...

492
00:39:53,144 --> 00:39:55,104
..."quarterly decline,"
yadda, yadda, yadda.

493
00:39:55,312 --> 00:39:59,650
But what they were truly saying,
in my opinion....

494
00:40:03,571 --> 00:40:05,114
They're broke.

495
00:40:05,906 --> 00:40:08,701
-You are kidding me.
-No.

496
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:12,288
I mean, the economy's in the toilet.
We all know that.

497
00:40:12,496 --> 00:40:17,126
And all these big banks
and Fannie Mae and....

498
00:40:17,335 --> 00:40:20,004
Well, apparently, Gray Matter...

499
00:40:20,212 --> 00:40:24,050
...is no more immune
than anyone else.

500
00:40:25,426 --> 00:40:27,094
That is--

501
00:40:28,846 --> 00:40:30,973
Jesus, that's....

502
00:40:34,435 --> 00:40:35,728
Yeah.

503
00:40:45,946 --> 00:40:52,078
You know, she could have
just told me herself.

504
00:40:54,664 --> 00:40:57,249
Well, they're prideful people.

505
00:40:59,877 --> 00:41:01,504
Listen.

506
00:41:03,172 --> 00:41:05,216
Not to sound selfish...

507
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:08,427
...but as far as we go...

508
00:41:08,636 --> 00:41:12,098
...we'll get through this, okay?

509
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:19,063
I mean, they've already paid
for most of my treatment, right?

510
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:20,773
Hey.

511
00:41:24,902 --> 00:41:29,573
We're gonna make it. All right?
I promise.

512
00:41:29,782 --> 00:41:31,742
Okay.

513
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,338
And yet...

514
00:41:45,673 --> 00:41:48,676
...she still drives a Bentley.

515
00:41:53,764 --> 00:41:57,977
Keeping up appearances.
Who knows?

516
00:42:10,364 --> 00:42:13,326
Baby, that don't make any sense.

517
00:42:13,534 --> 00:42:17,246
Of course it makes sense.
Every safe's got its weak spot, right?

518
00:42:17,455 --> 00:42:20,249
You're designing a safe, where
you gonna put your weak spot?

519
00:42:20,458 --> 00:42:21,917
Nowhere.

520
00:42:22,126 --> 00:42:25,046
I'd make it, like, strong.

521
00:42:25,254 --> 00:42:27,340
Jesus. On the bottom, that's where.

522
00:42:27,548 --> 00:42:29,675
You put your weak spot
on the bottom.

523
00:42:29,884 --> 00:42:34,597
Oh, baby,
that H is bringing me down.

524
00:42:34,805 --> 00:42:37,099
Yeah, you took too much. I told you.

525
00:42:37,308 --> 00:42:40,311
I need to.... I need to even out.

526
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:43,731
-Let me get a hit of that crystal.
-Hell, no. You lost your share.

527
00:42:43,939 --> 00:42:45,232
Come on, baby.

528
00:42:45,441 --> 00:42:48,444
It's all I need, just a little hit.

529
00:42:48,653 --> 00:42:52,573
Shut the hell up, you dumb skank.
I'm trying to concentrate.

530
00:42:52,782 --> 00:42:54,617
I ain't no skank.

531
00:42:55,451 --> 00:42:59,205
I would appreciate an apology.

532
00:43:02,917 --> 00:43:03,959
What?

533
00:43:04,168 --> 00:43:06,879
I am trying to take
the high road here.

534
00:43:07,088 --> 00:43:08,422
Are you gonna do right?

535
00:43:08,631 --> 00:43:09,715
Listen to me, stupid.

536
00:43:09,924 --> 00:43:13,427
I am in the middle
of some very important work.

537
00:43:13,636 --> 00:43:17,390
I am on the verge here, all right?
So shut your skank ass pie hole...

538
00:43:17,598 --> 00:43:21,102
...and assist me and shut up.

539
00:43:24,522 --> 00:43:26,732
I ain't no skank.

540
00:43:26,941 --> 00:43:28,901
Skank, skank, skank ass skank.

541
00:43:29,485 --> 00:43:32,571
Skank ass skank. Skank ass skank.

542
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:34,573
You listening to me, skank?

543
00:43:35,157 --> 00:43:36,450
You hear me, skank?

544
00:43:36,659 --> 00:43:40,746
You are a skank ass skank. Skank.

545
00:43:40,955 --> 00:43:44,834
Skank, skank, skank. Skank.

546
00:43:45,042 --> 00:43:48,212
I ain't no skank.

547
00:43:48,587 --> 00:43:51,007
No, no, no. Don't. No.

548
00:44:07,273 --> 00:44:10,109
I ain't no skank.

549
00:45:10,127 --> 00:45:11,170
<i>911.</i>

550
00:45:24,308 --> 00:45:26,936
Hey, hey.
Hey, you remember peekaboo?

551
00:45:27,144 --> 00:45:30,356
Can you go peekaboo like this?
Can you keep your eyes closed?

552
00:45:30,564 --> 00:45:33,275
You keep them closed. That's good.
That's good. That's good.

553
00:45:33,484 --> 00:45:35,695
All right.
You keep them closed just like that.

554
00:45:35,903 --> 00:45:39,365
It's a little game
we're gonna play, okay?

555
00:45:51,794 --> 00:45:53,713
Here you go.

556
00:45:53,921 --> 00:45:58,551
Hey. Hey, look at me.
You wait right here. Okay?

557
00:45:58,759 --> 00:46:02,388
It's just part of the game.
You wait right here, and....

558
00:46:03,597 --> 00:46:07,393
Look, just....
Just don't go back inside. All right?

559
00:46:07,601 --> 00:46:10,521
You stay right here. Okay?

560
00:46:17,403 --> 00:46:21,032
You have a good
rest of your life, kid.
