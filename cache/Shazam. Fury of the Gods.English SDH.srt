as a leader,

pediatrician,

90
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:06,825
right?

91
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:09,578
I mean, yeah, well,
you were recommended

92

Can you help fix my thoughts
so that

95

they just, like, you know,
stop happening?

All right, look.

97
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,588
And, again, pediatrician,
not a psychiatrist,

98
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,506
but it sounds to me like

99
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,800
you're experiencing
imposter syndrome.

100
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:27,679
And often, that originates
from trauma early in life,

101
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,639
so if you don't
mind me asking,

102
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:31,850
how well do you remember
your childhood?

103
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,727
Like it was today. [chuckles]

104
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,605
Trauma? Uh, I don't know.

105
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,148
I mean, I never met my dad.

106
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,610
Uh, my mom abandoned me
at a Christmas carnival.

107
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:43,153
I spent a lot of time
in the foster system,

108
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:44,404
ran away from 11 homes,

109
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,447
got into a lot of fights.

110
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,865
Then I was abducted by a wizard

111
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:47,908
who gave me superpowers

112
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,076
and then dude just, like,
died in front of my face.

113
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,328
That's not a small amount.

114
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,787
A doctor conjured seven demons

115
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,080
and held my whole family hostage,

116
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,707
so we had to rip out
one of his eyeballs,

117
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,292
and then everybody
got superpowers,

118
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:58,919
but now everyone's kind of,
like, doing their own thing

119
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:01,046
and I'm the only one trying
to keep everybody together.

to go to college says.

So,

00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:19,747
let's go back to the tape.

334
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,499
Now, guys, as you can see,

335
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:24,460
we started off real, real,
real, real strong, right?

00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:27,213

Gotta fly IRL.

340
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,219
No, no, no, I'm not done
with the presentation.

341
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,887
I know. And I love these daily recaps.

342
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:37,390
I just gotta spread my wings
a bit before dinner.

343
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,642
-It helps keep me loose!
-Okay, fine, fine. No recap.

344
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,352
We'll go have a group hang in the air.
That sounds great.

345
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,853
I gotta test this slime for toxicity

346

'cause I'm starting to... tingle.

347
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,942
Oh. The, uh, Phillies game
just came on

348
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,695
so I'm gonna go ahead
and, uh, watch baseball.

349
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,155
It's right that I give Tawny back.

What is happening?

351

What is happening right now?
All or none, guys!

352
00:17:58,828 --> 00:17:59,662
If you say you have to work...

353
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,122
I have to work.

[sighs, chuckles]
Why do you even have a job?

355
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:04,792
Wonder Woman
doesn't have a job!

356
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,085
-Stop.
-No, seriously.

357
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,503
Do you think she wears
a ponytail and glasses

358
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:08,588
and, like, nobody
recognizes her

359
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:09,505
and she's, like, an accountant
or something?

360
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,506
Just stop.

361
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,717
You are holding on too tight.

362
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:16,012
Just 'cause Freddy wants
to fly solo for ten minutes

363
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,431
doesn't mean he's gonna
leave you like your mom.

364
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,516
Or me wanting to go to college

365
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,976
means I'm abandoning the family.

366
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,603
Oh. Okay, cool,

367
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,438
it's about college again.
I totally get it.

368
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:26,564
Yeah.

369
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,149
Do you really not see yourself?

00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,525
[sighs]

371
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:36,991
You turn 18 in five months.

372
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,409
They're not gonna kick me out.

373
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,452
They didn't kick you out.

374
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:40,953
Victor and Rosa are saints, yes,

375
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:41,954
but you're about to age out

376

of the foster system just like I did.

377
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:46,250
Yeah, I get it.
I know how it works, okay?

378
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:47,877
Do you?

379
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:51,464
Victor and Rosa
can barely pay rent.

380
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,592
And the state no longer sends
checks to feed or house me

381
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,761
and soon there will be
no checks for you.

382
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,765
I don't care
if Wonder Woman has a job.

383
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,142
I want to contribute.

384

At some point, Billy, like

385
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:07,271
everyone on Earth,
we have to get a job or...

Yes. After you ripped it

Well, it made me laugh.

493
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,430
So...

494
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,311
-[chuckles]
-Hero.

[mouthing]

496
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:45,234
You gonna walk me to class,
or what?

497
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:47,277
Why would I...
Walk you to class? No.

498
00:24:47,361 --> 00:24:49,071
Why would I wanna do that?
Yes!

499
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:50,781
Thanks. [chuckles]

500
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,075
So, from the top.

501
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,370
What is Thundercrack's
Make-A-Wish kid?

502
00:24:56,453 --> 00:25:00,416
Yeah. Um, it's real inside baseball,
but basically,

503
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,876
a while ago I happened
to have some lunch

504
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,878
in the cafeteria
with a few superheroes.

505
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:08,257
Wait, the kid who's friends
with superheroes.

506
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,258
-That was you?
-Yeah.

507
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,592
And they're still dicks to you?

508
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,678
Sadly, just 'cause
you know someone cool,

509
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:14,430
doesn't really necessarily
make you cool.

510
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:16,473
You seem pretty cool to me.

511
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:20,269
[loudly] Freddy!

512
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:23,480
Is my name.

513
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:26,066
Sorry, that was weird and loud.
I'm Freddy,

515
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,194
I'm Anne.

530
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,368
Well done.

531
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:22,289
Now go find me the one
responsible for this.

Wow. Um... [chuckles]

535
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,143
I'm flattered
that you feel this way.

536
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:47,064
Truly, I mean, you know, like,
look at all this, you know...

I mean, you went all out.

00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:56,615
I love that, I, I, I, I do.

541
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:57,825
I'm just not sure

542
00:26:57,908 --> 00:27:00,327
that I'm really ready
to commit right now, you know.

543
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,038
Wait, wait, wait.
No, this isn't about you.

544
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:06,583
I promise this is not about you.
Okay? Look... [chuckles]

545
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:09,503
I know the whole world wants
to see this happen.

546
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:10,462
You and me.

547
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:14,633

The hottie goddies. [chuckles]

I guess I'm just afraid that I'm
gonna let 'em all down.

550

You know?

551
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:25,227
That I'm gonna let you down.

552

You know what?
Screw it. Let's try.

Let's try this crazy thing.

What the hell is going on?

What happened to her beautiful face?

00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:02,681
Also, aren't you, like, dead-ass dead?

562
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:05,100
I bring a warning
from beyond your realm.

The daughters of Atlas
are coming for you.

Daughters of Atlas?

565
00:28:08,312 --> 00:28:09,771
They're coming to unmake your world

566
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:12,816
and torture mankind for all eternity

-in the Pit of Endless Agony.
-Okay, I feel like maybe

I regret ever choosing you.

has been brought down.

The fate of your world depends on it.

One thing you absolutely
must not allow

580

that I don't love her.

to give me a message.

00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,599
A girl.
For the first time in my life!

653
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,601
And I probably don't have
a shot in hell with this girl,

654
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:35,977
but I'll never find out

if you keep trying to control
everything I wanna do!

Just be at the Rock, Freddy.

[sighs] Okay. Mmm.

658
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:44,444
By the way, uh,
she has a sister.

I think you guys
would get along.

661
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:48,907
Think you'd love her, actually.

I know it sounds crazy.

00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:53,328
And, and obviously

665
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:55,705
I don't know exactly
what this all means

666
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:57,457
but, but he was super aggro

667
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,584
and super loud and he was
trying to warn us, I think.

668
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:00,669
He was yelling about all this

about realms and stuff.

Do you have to talk so loud?

671
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:07,175
Yeah, Mary,
'cause this is not that loud.

672
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:08,301

Are you okay?

-Yeah.
-Why do you have

sunglasses on?

677

Did you go to the eye doctor
this morning?

I dunno, it looks to me like
Mary did go to the eye doctor,

680
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:23,275
but it was last night,
and she had a lot of fun.

681
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,694
In point of fact,
I did have a great time.

682
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:29,281
I met other people my age
and I enjoyed myself.

683
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,491
You made friends
at the eye doctor?

684
00:32:31,575 --> 00:32:32,784
No, she...

685
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:34,578
Yeah. Can we get back on track?

686
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,371
Listen, he's yelling at me

687
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,373
and he's saying
the daughters of Atlas

688
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:40,208
are coming to hunt us.

689

I don't know, man.
This is your meeting.

Right, yes, fine, but we all

a tutorial here, guys, okay?

00:37:55,148 --> 00:37:57,525
Until the rebellion,
when the humans turned on the gods.

812
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:59,277
I'm reading about that right now.

813
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,987
So, apparently, all of this

814
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,989
revolves around
a powerful weapon.

815
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:05,074
So Atlas, uh, the father

816
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:07,285
of the daughters of Atlas,
obviously, yeah,

817
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:09,204
he crafted a quarterstaff
from the Tree of Life

818
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,873
and he used that staff to
give powers to certain deities

819
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,751
but also to take powers away
from others.

820
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:18,421
So, the staff's where Atlas
stored all supernatural power.

821
00:38:18,505 --> 00:38:22,133
Yes, exactly.
It's like a, a battery for magic.

822
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:23,760
But when things got bad,

823
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:26,805
a council of human wizards
got together and they

824
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:27,931
stole the staff from Atlas.

825
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,390
And they used that to take
his powers away.

826
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:31,518
And once they had his magic
they went after other gods...

827
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:33,144
Guys, that's the wizard!
I know this guy.

828
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:34,437
This is the wizard that I know!

829
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,272
What do these say?

830
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:42,946
"The Wisdom of Solomon,

831
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,906
Strength of Hercules,
Stamina of Atlas,

832
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,324
Power of Zeus,
Courage of Achilles,

833
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:47,242
Speed of Mercury."

834
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,993
These are the powers they stole.

835
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:51,871
No.

836
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:54,374
Whoa, guys, look!

837
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:55,500
This is what the name means.

838
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,460
Which is way cooler
than what I thought it was,

839
00:38:57,544 --> 00:38:59,128
which is just a bunch
of hot garbage, so.

840
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:00,380
If I may point out one
of the powers

841
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:03,424
that may be possibly MIA.
Boop.

842
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,301
SHAZAM: I'm sorry,

843
00:39:05,385 --> 00:39:07,262
are you very unsubtly implying

844
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,514
that I somehow lack
the wisdom of

845
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:11,891
-Solo Man?
-Yeah.

846
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:13,852
Well, maybe it comes later.

847
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:16,604
I mean, you do usually
ask Mary what to do.

848
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:17,689
-I'm just saying.
-Yeah.

849
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:18,982
This is very, very hurtful.

850
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,233
I just want you all to know that.

851
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,651
And it's pronounced "Solomon."

852
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,236
-Oh.
-[Shazam clears throat]

853
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,904
What else have we learned, fam?

854
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:28,575
Well, once the staff contained
the powers of the gods,

855
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:33,705
the wizards apparently
encased the God Realm in some

856
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,915
magical sphere

857
00:39:35,999 --> 00:39:37,834
sealing it away forever.

858
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:38,918
Cut off from magic.

859
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:42,130
Oh, so that's what
that was about.

860
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,383
Yeah, I don't think that
they are so cut off anymore.

861
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,679
<i>A bizarre and gruesome scene
unfolded</i>

862
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,306
<i>in Athens, Greece
this morning.</i>

863
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,308
<i>Two women, dressed in what
appears to be ancient Greek...</i>

864
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,434
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
that's the Wizard's staff.

865
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:55,643
How did they get that?

866
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:57,395
So, all those statues
used to be people.

867
00:39:57,478 --> 00:40:01,065
I'm wondering, how did
the staff end up in Europe,

868
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:02,567
where Greece is at?

869
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:07,822
Oh, gee-whiz, mister,
sorry I took your cane.

870
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,616
You want it back?

871
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:14,579
I mean, I did break it in half
and then throw it away.

872
00:40:14,913 --> 00:40:15,955
So, that's probably

873
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,248
where the journey started.

874
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:18,249
-You know?
-What?

875
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:19,542
What do you mean,
"What?" What?

876
00:40:19,626 --> 00:40:21,377
-You just left it there?
-We were all there.

877
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:23,671
Guys, I had a staff.
I gave you all superpowers.

878
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:24,797
You're welcome, by the way.

879
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:26,674
And then I had to break it
in half so Sivana didn't do

880
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:28,885
super bad-guy stuff with it, okay?

881
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,261
You broke the staff,

882
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:32,388
meaning you broke the barrier
between worlds.

883
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:33,723
Which we now know.

884
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,516
We also now know
what they look like,

885
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,435
so when they come to hunt us,
we'll see those two

886
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:38,519
-coming a...
-Three.

895
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:00,875

896
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:04,045
That you may have
feelings for Freddy.

What is that?
What's she doing?

1134
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:16,008
Power of chaos.

1135
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:18,802
It enters a man's mind
and shatters it whole.

Oh. [chuckles]
My mind is already trash,

to see you try.

when you stepped in.

But you didn't know that,
which does make you brave.

1234
00:57:04,713 --> 00:57:07,007
I was just brave because
I knew I had powers.

1235

No, the most powerful thing
about you is you.

-Yes.

00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:49,276
you would naturally
give chase, would you not?

1275
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,237
And say, in this pursuit
the thieves

1276
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,405
dropped the money
on the ground

1277

and your neighbor picked it up
and kept it.

of your father.

1449
01:08:06,958 --> 01:08:08,793
It was an apple.
She wanted a snack.

1450

What's the big deal?

1451
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:13,339
The golden apple.
From the Tree of Life.

1452
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:14,507
From the Tree of Life.

Oh, wait, hold up, didn't you
say that was somewhere safe?

She's not in there.

01:08:37,572 --> 01:08:38,573
Nope.

1461
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:40,074
No, no, no.
That's a hard pass.

1462
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:42,493
-That's a hard pass.
SUPERHERO EUGENE: Yo, Billy,

1463
01:08:42,577 --> 01:08:43,536
you don't gotta worry
about that one.

1464

Now we can plant the seed
and restore our realm.

Or we plant it in their realm.

But that would destroy
their world.

1474

we've spent ages

[chuckles] That's it. You nailed it.

I'll see you on the other side.

HESPERA: Even if we did,
the Tree of Life

would not thrive
in their soil.

1500
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:15,962
It would despoil,
it would disfigure into something...

KALYPSO: Monstrous?

1502
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:19,090
That is what humans are.

1503
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:21,050
It is only fitting
that we bring

1504

our monsters to their world

1505
01:10:22,802 --> 01:10:25,221

Humans wreak havoc
and devastation,

1515
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:48,578
then pray to the gods
to absolve them.

1516
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:51,164
They actually pray
for order and peace

1517
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:54,167
when all they do
is dismantle it at every turn.

1518
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,794
Anthea, I want you to take the apple

1519

and plant it in our garden.

I am no longer the champion.
You are!

You think I know
how to fix this, dude,

but I really don't, okay?

1699
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:26,233
I, I didn't even know
who those Greek sisters were.

1700
01:22:26,316 --> 01:22:27,901
I had to Google them.
But you know who they are,

1701
01:22:27,985 --> 01:22:29,403
which means you know
what to do.

1702
01:22:29,486 --> 01:22:30,487
And you were right.

1703
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:33,240
You picked the wrong champion, man.

1704
01:22:33,907 --> 01:22:35,617
I mean, that's why I always
say "all or none," right?

1705
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:37,703
Because without my family,
I'm nothing.

1706

And honestly, I have no idea
what I'm doin'.

WIZARD: No.

1708

You don't have
a shred of wisdom

01:22:46,253 --> 01:22:47,713
in that brain of yours.

1710
01:22:48,881 --> 01:22:50,716
But your heart is wise.

1711
01:22:51,550 --> 01:22:53,760
And it knows exactly
what must be done.

1712
01:22:55,012 --> 01:22:58,432
I spent millennia searching
for a worthy champion

1713
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:02,269
and no one was worthy
of what I once shared

1714
01:23:02,352 --> 01:23:04,229
with my brothers and sisters.

1715
01:23:04,813 --> 01:23:06,648
But when you shared your powers,

1716
01:23:08,025 --> 01:23:09,318
you did not hesitate.

1717
01:23:09,693 --> 01:23:11,778
For you, everyone can be worthy

1718

if given a chance.

1719
01:23:13,363 --> 01:23:16,033
Now, go fight for your family.

1720

01:57:05,894 --> 01:57:08,313
Your name is

2264
01:57:09,272 --> 01:57:10,273
Shazam.

2265
01:57:11,399 --> 01:57:12,234
-Of course.
-Yeah.

2266
01:57:12,317 --> 01:57:14,319
[all agreeing]

2267
01:57:16,029 --> 01:57:17,656
I still think we can beat it.

2268
01:57:17,739 --> 01:57:19,533
[upbeat music playing]

2269
01:59:57,607 --> 01:59:59,234
My feet hurt.
How much further?

2270
01:59:59,317 --> 02:00:00,402
About ten seconds less

2271
02:00:00,485 --> 02:00:02,028
than the last time you asked me.

2272
02:00:02,112 --> 02:00:03,697
I'm sorry, I just feel
like we could

2273
02:00:03,780 --> 02:00:04,948
have parked a little
bit closer.

2274
02:00:05,031 --> 02:00:06,116
He doesn't know we're coming,

2275
02:00:06,199 --> 02:00:07,534
and I didn't want to spook him.

2276
02:00:07,617 --> 02:00:09,994
"Spook him."
He's a superhero, not a deer.

2277
02:00:10,078 --> 02:00:11,079
All right, let's go.

2278
02:00:11,496 --> 02:00:13,540
And then you can tell Waller
that even though

2279
02:00:13,623 --> 02:00:15,834
she thinks this guy could be
a good addition to the team,

2280
02:00:15,917 --> 02:00:17,460
we never actually met him

2281
02:00:17,544 --> 02:00:19,838
because you wore
shitty walking shoes.

2282
02:00:19,921 --> 02:00:21,840
[chuckles] Okay, first of all,
they're boots,

2283
02:00:21,923 --> 02:00:23,550
and they're not shitty,
they're new.

2284
02:00:23,633 --> 02:00:24,759
I just haven't had a chance
to break them in yet.

2285
02:00:24,843 --> 02:00:25,844
Shut up.

2286
02:00:26,845 --> 02:00:29,389
Waller said this guy
is as powerful as they come,

2287
02:00:29,472 --> 02:00:30,890
but a little immature.

2288
02:00:31,683 --> 02:00:32,684
Oh, great.

2289
02:00:33,643 --> 02:00:36,187
Whoo! [chuckles]

2290
02:00:40,900 --> 02:00:42,902
[grunting]

2291
02:00:45,113 --> 02:00:46,573
-Billy Batson.
-Yeah?

2292
02:00:46,656 --> 02:00:47,741
I mean, no.

2293
02:00:48,491 --> 02:00:50,160
I've never heard that name
in my life.

2294
02:00:50,243 --> 02:00:51,494
I don't know who
you're talking about.

2295
02:00:51,578 --> 02:00:53,204
But I'd like to meet that person

2296
02:00:53,288 --> 02:00:54,914
'cause they sound super cool.
And funny.

2297
02:00:54,998 --> 02:00:57,834
And talented.
And ridiculously handsome,

2298
02:00:57,917 --> 02:00:59,169
but like in a dangerous way.

2299
02:00:59,252 --> 02:01:01,171
What the hell
are you talking about?

2300
02:01:01,254 --> 02:01:02,839
Relax. We know who you are.

2301
02:01:03,798 --> 02:01:05,675
-How?
-Don't worry about that.

2302
02:01:06,676 --> 02:01:07,761
Who are you guys?

2303
02:01:07,844 --> 02:01:09,137
Don't worry about that either.

2304
02:01:09,220 --> 02:01:10,847
Look, we've seen what you can do.

2305
02:01:10,930 --> 02:01:12,682
And we're here
to make you an offer.

2306
02:01:12,766 --> 02:01:13,767
How would you like to join

2307
02:01:13,850 --> 02:01:14,851
-the Justice...
-Yes!

2308
02:01:15,185 --> 02:01:16,352
A thousand times yes!

2309
02:01:16,436 --> 02:01:18,313
Oh, my gosh!
I've been dreaming about this!

2310
02:01:19,230 --> 02:01:20,398
Well, I mean, not this exactly.

2311
02:01:20,482 --> 02:01:21,608
Like, normally,
it's Wonder Woman

2312
02:01:21,691 --> 02:01:22,650
in the dream, but...

2313
02:01:22,734 --> 02:01:24,277
-Ew.
-Huh?

2314
02:01:24,360 --> 02:01:25,779
Well, that was easy.

2315
02:01:26,571 --> 02:01:27,906
Welcome
to the Justice Society.

2316
02:01:27,989 --> 02:01:29,991
Yeah! Aweso-- Wait, what?

2317
02:01:30,074 --> 02:01:31,284
The Justice Society?

2318
02:01:31,367 --> 02:01:32,744
Is that different
than the Justice League?

2319
02:01:32,827 --> 02:01:34,704
Yes. The Justice Society

2320
02:01:34,788 --> 02:01:35,955
is different
than the Justice League

2321
02:01:36,039 --> 02:01:37,749
because of how words work.

2322
02:01:37,832 --> 02:01:39,709
I just want to be
in the Wonder Woman group.

2323
02:01:39,793 --> 02:01:42,003
-So, that's you guys, right?
-No.

2324
02:01:42,086 --> 02:01:44,130
Why are you so obsessed
with Wonder Woman, dude?

2325
02:01:44,214 --> 02:01:45,173
He's joking, right?

2326
02:01:46,132 --> 02:01:48,843
-No?
-Okay. I'm out.

2327
02:01:49,427 --> 02:01:51,346
I'm gonna wait here,
'cause of the shoes.

2328
02:01:51,429 --> 02:01:53,389
Can you drive by and get me?

2329
02:01:53,473 --> 02:01:55,975
SHAZAM: Hey, just a little
constructive criticism.

2330
02:01:56,059 --> 02:01:57,268
It's pretty confusing
that there are

2331
02:01:57,352 --> 02:01:59,229
two separate groups
of superheroes

2332
02:01:59,312 --> 02:02:00,563
that are totally unaffiliated,

2333
02:02:00,647 --> 02:02:02,565
but both have "Justice"
in their name, you know.

2334
02:02:02,649 --> 02:02:03,775
Like, have you guys ever
thought about doing

2335
02:02:03,858 --> 02:02:04,943
a rebranding of sorts?

2336
02:02:05,026 --> 02:02:08,196
'Cause just a quick search
on Thesaurus.com,

2337
02:02:08,279 --> 02:02:09,739
you got so many options, man.

2338
02:02:09,823 --> 02:02:11,991
Like, "Authority Society." Eh?

2339
02:02:12,826 --> 02:02:14,911
Uh, uh, "Code Society."
That's stupid.

2340
02:02:14,994 --> 02:02:16,162
These are, like, legal terms.

2341
02:02:16,246 --> 02:02:19,249
[gasps] "The Avenger Society."

2342
02:02:19,332 --> 02:02:20,375
[inhales sharply]

2343
02:02:20,834 --> 02:02:22,335
I like that, for some reason.

2344
02:02:25,171 --> 02:02:27,173
[gentle music playing]

2345
02:02:42,355 --> 02:02:44,774
[music builds up]

2346
02:02:51,406 --> 02:02:53,408
[dramatic music playing]

2347
02:06:07,226 --> 02:06:09,228
[mysterious music playing]

2348
02:07:35,398 --> 02:07:37,400
[intense music playing]

2349
02:08:35,583 --> 02:08:37,585
[distant chattering]

2350
02:08:37,668 --> 02:08:39,670
[unsettling music playing]

2351
02:08:55,186 --> 02:08:56,687
[voice laughing]

2352
02:08:58,147 --> 02:09:01,776
MISTER MIND: Well, well, Doctor.
We meet again.

2353
02:09:01,859 --> 02:09:03,653
Where in the hell have you been?!

2354
02:09:03,736 --> 02:09:06,781
MISTER MIND: To implement
the perfect plan, Doctor,

2355
02:09:06,864 --> 02:09:09,116
one must have patience.

2356
02:09:09,200 --> 02:09:10,451
What are you talking about?

2357
02:09:12,495 --> 02:09:14,330
It's been two goddamn years!

2358
02:09:14,413 --> 02:09:19,168
Yes. But what is time
but a trick of the mind?

2359
02:09:19,252 --> 02:09:20,753
A meaningless measure.

2360
02:09:20,836 --> 02:09:23,381
Hey. I'm 57 years old.

2361
02:09:23,464 --> 02:09:26,592
I'm stuck in a concrete box
surrounded by lunatics

2362
02:09:26,676 --> 02:09:28,803
waiting for a worm to enact
some, what,

2363
02:09:28,886 --> 02:09:31,097
vague plan I've been told
absolutely nothing about?

2364
02:09:31,180 --> 02:09:33,808
It takes me a very long time
to get places, okay?

2365
02:09:33,891 --> 02:09:36,894
I do not have legs,
I do not have wings,

2366
02:09:36,978 --> 02:09:40,106
I just slither around endlessly.

2367
02:09:40,189 --> 02:09:42,316
But not for long.

2368
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:44,277
[laughing]

2369
02:09:45,528 --> 02:09:47,613
Tell me everything.

2370
02:09:48,739 --> 02:09:50,491
Just one more thing
I need to do.

2371
02:09:50,574 --> 02:09:52,994
What? No!

2372
02:09:54,495 --> 02:09:56,038
Oh, goddamn it!

2373
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:06,000
