1
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:29,914
Hey!

2
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,411
...a dark and stormy Halloween.

3
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,418
Good evening and welcome to
GC-1 News live at 8:00.

4
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,045
Our top story tonight,

5
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:10,464
Just-released polls have
incumbent Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.

6
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:14,384
and 28-year-old grassroots challenger
Bella Real in a dead heat.

7
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:15,969
Things certainly got hot last night

8
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:19,514
in their final debate
before next Tuesday's election.

9
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,644
Now, my young opponent here wants to
gut the Gotham Renewal Program,

10
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,479
established by the great Thomas Wayne.

11
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,315
Cutting funds from vital projects
like our sea wall

12
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,858
and the safety net
for those who need it.

13
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:34,112
The Renewal Program is broken.
This city's been renewing for 20 years.

14
00:02:34,196 --> 00:02:36,990
Look where it's gotten us.
Crime has skyrocketed.

15
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,450
Murder and drug use
are at historic highs.

16
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,504
Now wait... Now hang on.

17
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:41,787
We have a masked vigilante
running the street.

18
00:02:41,817 --> 00:02:42,966
Under my administration,

19
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:46,792
the Gotham PD has dealt major blows
to organized crime and drug trafficking.

20
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:50,379
The Salvatore Maroni case was
the biggest drug bust in city history.

21
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:52,756
But drops and other drugs
are still rampant.

22
00:02:52,786 --> 00:02:53,852
It's gotten worse.

23
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,175
I'm not saying there isn't work to do.

24
00:02:55,205 --> 00:02:56,271
But listen...

25
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,719
I have a beautiful
wife and young son, okay?

26
00:02:57,803 --> 00:02:59,262
And I will not rest...

27
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:04,967
Hey.

28
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,939
Yeah, I'm watching it now.

29
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,821
Why is she still tied?

30
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:23,412
But I thought we were getting
a bump in the new Post poll.

31
00:03:30,502 --> 00:03:32,921
Okay, you know what?
I can't watch this anymore.

32
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,881
Just call me in the morning, okay?

33
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:40,512
...who still believes in
everything this city can do.

34
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,140
We need a leader, Mr. Mitchell,
not a cheerleader.

35
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,892
And someone who will
tell the people the truth.

36
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:07,682
Thursday, October 31st.

37
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,281
The city streets are crowded
for the holiday.

38
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,119
Even with the rain.

39
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:35,085
Hidden in the chaos is the element,

40
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,088
waiting to strike like snakes.

41
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,091
But I'm there too.

42
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,844
Watching.

43
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:49,850
Two years of nights have turned me
into a nocturnal animal.

44
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,024
I must choose my targets carefully.

45
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:13,498
- Come on! Give me the money.
- Okay.

46
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:16,293
- Let's go! Let's go!
- All right, all right!

47
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,878
It's a big city.

48
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,217
I can't be everywhere.

49
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,730
But they don't know where I am.

50
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,653
Look at this guy, man.

51
00:06:48,888 --> 00:06:50,088
Boom!

52
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,318
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

53
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,750
So good, man.
That's what I'm talking about!

54
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,251
Yo, let's see your hits.

55
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,462
That's you.

56
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:24,861
We have a signal now.
For when I'm needed.

57
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,823
But when that light hits the sky,

58
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,701
it's not just a call.

59
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,829
It's a warning.

60
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:37,823
To them.

61
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:48,551
Fear...

62
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,682
Is a tool.

63
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:07,946
Are you out of your mind?
Watch where you're goin', drophead!

64
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,335
They think I'm hiding in the shadows.

65
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,496
Come on!

66
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,641
But I am the shadows.

67
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,995
- Come on, come on.
- Whoo!

68
00:08:58,309 --> 00:08:59,509
- Hey, go on, man! Go!
- Get him!

69
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,999
- Come on, man!
- What are you doin'?

70
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,209
Help!

71
00:09:03,293 --> 00:09:04,502
Somebody help me!

72
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:07,297
Help, help!

73
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,388
Where you goin', huh?

74
00:09:19,997 --> 00:09:21,197
Come on.

75
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:22,896
Come on, man. Break it.

76
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,483
You can't move, huh?

77
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,568
Now knock his ass out.

78
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,361
Showtime. Showtime, man.

79
00:09:30,842 --> 00:09:32,042
Come on, man.

80
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,323
Come on. Do it, man.

81
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,276
You see this guy?

82
00:10:17,492 --> 00:10:19,119
The hell are you supposed to be?

83
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,428
I'm vengeance.

84
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:40,473
Holy shit. It's him.

85
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,366
Hey, man. No, no, no!

86
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,418
Please don't hurt me.

87
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:28,039
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

88
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,833
Police action.

89
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,086
He's with me, Officer.

90
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:36,923
Are you kidding me, sir?

91
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,592
You're gonna let him in here?

92
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,054
Martinez, let him through.

93
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:58,444
Goddamn freak.

94
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,535
What do we know?

95
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:27,640
Detective?

96
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,350
Sorry, Lieutenant.

97
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:34,731
We got blunt force trauma.
Lacerations on the head.

98
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,651
He got hit a lot of times. And hard.

99
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,448
All this blood is from his head?

100
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,106
No.

101
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,455
Excuse me.

102
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,625
Most of it's from his hand.

103
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,289
Thumb was severed.

104
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,969
Killer may have taken it as a trophy.

105
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,263
He was alive when it was cut off.

106
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:09,974
Ecchymosis...

107
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,769
around the wound.

108
00:14:27,992 --> 00:14:29,702
Security detail downstairs

109
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,996
said the family was out
trick-or-treatin'.

110
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:35,708
The mayor was up here alone.

111
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,838
Killer may have come
through the skylight.

112
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,013
You said there was a card.

113
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:50,681
Yeah.

114
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,861
"From your secret friend. Whoo?

115
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,864
Haven't a clue?

116
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:09,325
Let's play a game, just me and you.

117
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:12,912
What does a liar do when he's dead?"

118
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,332
There's a cipher too.

119
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,966
Any of this mean anything to you?

120
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,719
What's going on here?

121
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,224
I asked him to come, Pete.

122
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,976
This is a crime scene.

123
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,395
It's Mitchell, for christ sakes!

124
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:39,480
I got the press downstairs.

125
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:42,316
You know, I cut you a lot of slack, Jim,
'cause we got history.

126
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,235
But this is way over the line.

127
00:15:47,843 --> 00:15:49,043
Wait.

128
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,783
- He's involved in this?
- No, he's not involved.

129
00:15:50,846 --> 00:15:52,046
How do you know?

130
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:55,079
He's a goddamn vigilante!
He could be a suspect!

131
00:15:55,163 --> 00:15:56,914
What are you doin' to me?
We used to be partners.

132
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:58,624
I'm just trying
to find the connection, Pete.

133
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,251
He lies still.

134
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:02,952
Excuse me?

135
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:05,497
The riddle.

136
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:09,385
What does a liar do when he's dead?
He lies still.

137
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,021
Oh, Jesus.

138
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:26,068
This must be your favorite night
of the year, huh, pal?

139
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,905
Happy fuckin' Halloween.

140
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,324
Excuse me, Commissioner.

141
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,076
They're ready for your statement.

142
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,832
I want him outta here.

143
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,658
Now!

144
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,342
Come on.

145
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:03,356
Yeah.

146
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:06,025
The kid found him.

147
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:14,033
Was there anyone else
in the house when you arrived?

148
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,635
We really gotta go, man.

149
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:41,936
Tonight, a son lost a father.

150
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,230
A wife lost a husband.

151
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,983
And I lost a friend.

152
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:50,611
Mayor Mitchell
was a fighter for the city,

153
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:53,781
and I will not rest
until his killer is found.

154
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,409
This was a truly senseless crime,

155
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:00,580
and we are actively pursuing
every investigative lead we have

156
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:04,750
in order to identify the perpetrator
and hunt him down.

157
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,085
I've spoken to the governor...

158
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:09,005
I wish I could say
I'm making a difference,

159
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,673
but I don't know.

160
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:19,473
Murder, robberies, assault.

161
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:21,642
Two years later, they're all up.

162
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:23,728
And now this.

163
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,481
The city's eating itself.

164
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,444
Maybe it's beyond saving.

165
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,823
But I have to try.

166
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:37,867
Push myself.

167
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:26,457
These nights all roll together in a rush

168
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,335
behind the mask.

169
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,133
Sometimes in the morning,

170
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,096
I have to force myself to remember

171
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:44,058
everything that happened.

172
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,199
Unbelievable
breaking news this hour, everyone.

173
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:04,161
Again, four-term incumbent
Gotham Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.

174
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:07,081
was found murdered last night
inside his home

175
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,916
in the exclusive Crest Hill district.

176
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,668
Exact details of the crime

177
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,253
still have not been released,

178
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,214
but a citywide manhunt
is already underway

179
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:18,551
as police and FBI search
for the brazen Killer.

180
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:20,469
And this certainly is not the first time

181
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:23,097
Gotham has been rocked by
the murder of a political figure.

182
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:27,435
In fact, in an eerie coincidence,
it was 20 years ago this week

183
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:29,270
that celebrated
billionaire philanthropist

184
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,313
Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha

185
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:34,233
were slain during Wayne's
own mayoral campaign.

186
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:38,154
It was a shocking crime
that remains unsolved to this day.

187
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,030
Don Mitchell, Jr.'s political career

188
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:42,783
was especially notable
for his tough war on drugs

189
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:46,120
when he and city police
launched a major sting operation,

190
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:50,166
resulting in the arrest of notorious
mafia crime figure Salvatore Maroni

191
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:54,420
with what, to this day, remains
the biggest drug bust in GCPD history.

192
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,921
I assume you heard about this.

193
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,049
Yeah.

194
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,391
Oh, I see.

195
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,144
All this blood is from his head?

196
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:11,896
Dear God.

197
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,698
There's a cipher too.

198
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,000
Any of this mean anything to you?

199
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,963
The killer left this for the Batman?

200
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,050
Gordon}
I asked him to come, Pete.

201
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,333
Apparently.

202
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:44,303
You're becoming quite a celebrity.

203
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:47,681
Why is he writing to you?

204
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:49,183
It's Mitchell, for christ sakes!

205
00:21:49,213 --> 00:21:50,362
I don't know yet.

206
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,936
I got the press downstairs.

207
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,231
Have a shower.

208
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,359
Our accounting friends
at Wayne Enterprises

209
00:21:58,389 --> 00:21:59,413
are coming for breakfast.

210
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,445
Here? Why?

211
00:22:01,475 --> 00:22:02,666
Because I couldn't get you to go there.

212
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:03,834
I haven't got time for this.

213
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:05,533
It's getting serious, Bruce.

214
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:08,702
If this continues, it won't be long
before you've nothing left.

215
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:10,371
I don't care about that.

216
00:22:11,018 --> 00:22:12,218
Any of that.

217
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:13,749
You don't care about
your family's legacy?

218
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:19,255
What I'm doing is my family's legacy.

219
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,507
If I can't change things here,

220
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,968
if I can't have an effect,

221
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,679
then I don't care what happens to me.

222
00:22:26,742 --> 00:22:27,942
That's what I'm afraid of.

223
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:29,598
Alfred, stop.

224
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,434
You're not my father.

225
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:36,647
I'm well aware.

226
00:23:10,973 --> 00:23:13,225
We really gotta go, man.

227
00:23:38,876 --> 00:23:40,461
Some fresh berries there.

228
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:48,835
What are you doing?

229
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:52,806
Just reminiscing about
my days in the Circus.

230
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:57,102
This is actually quite elusive.

231
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,774
Where'd you get those O's?

232
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:06,111
"He lies still" is only a partial key.

233
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:08,614
It only gives us H, E, L, I, S, and T.

234
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:12,743
So, I'm looking for any double symbols
to start, trying letters,

235
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,203
see where it leads.

236
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,321
That's interesting.

237
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:19,574
Mr. Pennyworth?

238
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,075
Yes, Dory?

239
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,670
The accountants are here.

240
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:24,588
See them in, please, Dory.

241
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:29,718
What if it's not a partial key?

242
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,387
What do you mean?

243
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,305
What if this is the whole key?

244
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:36,767
Ignore the symbols
we don't have letters for.

245
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,894
Use only the letters from
"He lies still" and leave the rest...

246
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:40,178
Blank. Yeah, I understand.

247
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:42,356
But that would leave
most of the cipher unsolved.

248
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,274
I don't see how that's gonna...

249
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:48,019
Oh.

250
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,293
Damn.

251
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,713
Yeah, he's got a car.

252
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,008
Guess it's good to be the mayor.

253
00:25:09,091 --> 00:25:10,759
Where to even start?

254
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,679
You sure this isn't a leap?
"Drive" could mean anything.

255
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:14,962
You don't trust me?

256
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,391
You mean like you trust me?

257
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:20,352
It's been two years now,
and I don't even know who you are, man.

258
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,554
There.

259
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:47,880
What are we looking for?

260
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,049
A USB port.

261
00:25:50,132 --> 00:25:51,332
USB?

262
00:25:58,348 --> 00:25:59,548
What?

263
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:07,149
"Thumb" drive.

264
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,568
Jesus.

265
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:14,698
It's encrypted.

266
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,411
Try this.

267
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,796
Oh, this guy's hilarious.

268
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,265
Oh, well, well, well.

269
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,935
So much for family values.

270
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:44,302
Who is she?

271
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:45,938
No idea.

272
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,691
But that's the Penguin,
Carmine Falcone's right hand.

273
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,527
I know who he is.

274
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,185
What was that?

275
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,574
Shit, shit! The drive.

276
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:00,661
It sent out the photos from my account.

277
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:03,288
Gotham Post, Gazette, GC-1, all of them.

278
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:05,457
Jesus.

279
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,918
I'm gonna catch hell for this.
Pete's gonna bust a gasket.

280
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,461
"He lies still."

281
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:10,870
About her?

282
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:13,549
Maybe.

283
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,592
That's the Iceberg Lounge.

284
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:19,096
It's under the Shoreline Lofts
where Falcone was holed up.

285
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,306
Never get in there without a warrant.

286
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:24,842
Yeah.

287
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:39,032
Know who I am?

288
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,619
Yeah. I got an idea.

289
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,496
I want to see the Penguin.

290
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,457
I don't know
what you're talking about, pal.

291
00:27:52,692 --> 00:27:53,892
What's the problem?

292
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,340
Says he wants to see the Penguin.

293
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:57,593
Penguin? There's no Penguin here.

294
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,303
That's what I tried to tell him.

295
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,680
Get out of here, freak. You hear me?

296
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,640
Or that little suit's
gonna get all full of blood.

297
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:06,217
Mine or yours?

298
00:28:14,255 --> 00:28:15,455
Get him!

299
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:16,685
I saw that whole thing.

300
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:17,946
He's over there!

301
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,364
What is your problem?

302
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:04,201
Hey! Put the bat down,
or I'll blow your head off!

303
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:16,213
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

304
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:18,465
Take it easy, sweetheart.

305
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:20,342
You looking for me?

306
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:22,970
I see you met the twins.

307
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:27,224
Boy, you're everything they say,
ain't ya?

308
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,601
I guess we both are.

309
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:33,063
How you doing?

310
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:35,107
I'm Oz.

311
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:41,905
Who is she?

312
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,868
I really don't know, chief.

313
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,788
I might have been coming out
at the same time,

314
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,248
but I wasn't rolling with them.

315
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:05,878
It's okay, baby.

316
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:10,017
Mr. Vengeance here, he don't bite.
Come on.

317
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:36,960
Thank you, honey.

318
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:45,302
Here you go, champ.

319
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:48,930
I wanna know who she is,
and what she has to do with this murder.

320
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,807
- Whose murder?
- The mayor's.

321
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:52,684
Is that the mayor?

322
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:54,561
Oh, shit, it is. Look at that.

323
00:30:55,771 --> 00:30:57,064
Don't make me hurt you.

324
00:30:57,147 --> 00:31:01,318
You better watch it.
You know my reputation?

325
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:04,363
Yeah, I do. Do you?

326
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,616
Look...

327
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,661
I'm just the proprietor, okay?

328
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:16,792
I mean, what people do here
ain't got nothing to do with me.

329
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,718
Tell you one thing.

330
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:32,474
Whoever she is, she's one hot chick.

331
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:35,477
Why don't you ask Mitchell's wife?
Maybe she knows.

332
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,565
What? Too soon?

333
00:31:50,409 --> 00:31:52,786
You let me know
if there's anything else I can do.

334
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:03,287
Taxi!

335
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,790
Taxi!

336
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,653
Hey, it's me.

337
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,281
Baby, what's wrong?

338
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,950
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, slow down. I can't...

339
00:32:34,411 --> 00:32:35,829
On the news?

340
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:39,791
Okay. No. No, stay there.
Wait for me, okay?

341
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:41,585
Wait for me, I'm on my way home.

342
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:46,381
Listen, baby, we're gonna get
the hell out of here, okay? I promise.

343
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:49,718
If we have to leave earlier,
we'll leave tonight.

344
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:51,835
Uh...

345
00:32:54,014 --> 00:32:55,348
God damn it.

346
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:17,329
...photos of
murdered mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.

347
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,289
with a younger mystery woman.

348
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:22,209
In a shocking development, the police
believe the photos themselves...

349
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:58,578
Now they urge her to contact the GCPD...

350
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:14,422
You're pretty good at that.

351
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:48,164
Hey! Give me that.

352
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:54,337
"Kosolov, Annika."

353
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,924
He hurt her? That's why you killed him?

354
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:00,760
What? Oh, please.
Just give me the goddamn...

355
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,468
Listen, honey,
you got the wrong idea, okay?

356
00:37:41,551 --> 00:37:44,012
I didn't kill anybody.
I'm here for my friend.

357
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,472
She's trying to
get the hell out of here,

358
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:47,307
and this son of a bitch
stole her passport.

359
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,767
What does she know?

360
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,977
Whatever it is, it's got her so spooked
she won't even tell me.

361
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,645
She did seem upset.

362
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:55,940
Back at your place.

363
00:37:57,984 --> 00:37:59,486
Let's go talk to her.

364
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:26,878
Anni!

365
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:29,256
Baby!

366
00:38:30,725 --> 00:38:31,925
Anni!

367
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,106
Anni!

368
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:40,944
It's gonna be cool this evening.

369
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:43,238
It's gonna be down into the 40s.

370
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:45,198
More breaking news this hour

371
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:50,662
as the city is rocked by a second
high-profile murder in as many nights.

372
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:53,039
And this time, the killer has
come forward to claim credit online...

373
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:55,959
Jesus, what are they gonna do to her?
She's just a kid.

374
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:59,587
Shit, they took my phone.

375
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,047
His victim, longtime head
of the Gotham City PD,

376
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:02,549
Commissioner Pete Savage,

377
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:04,759
was found dead earlier tonight

378
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:08,054
inside the Police Athletic League
facilities in the Tricorner area.

379
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:11,474
The killer posted the following message
on social media,

380
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:14,435
and we have to warn you,
the video is very disturbing.

381
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:22,235
Hello, people of Gotham.

382
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,279
This is the Riddler speaking.

383
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,407
On Halloween night,

384
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:32,287
I killed your mayor because he was not
who he pretended to be.

385
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,414
But I am not done.

386
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:39,752
Here is another...

387
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:47,051
Who will soon be losing face.

388
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:52,599
I will kill again, and again, and again,

389
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:54,517
until our day of judgment

390
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:59,606
when the truth about our city
will finally...

391
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,400
be unmasked.

392
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:05,737
Goodbye!

393
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:11,618
Commissioner Savage
served a distinguished

394
00:40:11,701 --> 00:40:13,828
30-year career on the GCPD...

395
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:16,122
Holy shit, I seen that guy too.

396
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:18,698
At the club.

397
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:21,586
The Iceberg Lounge?

398
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:23,796
44 Below.

399
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:26,915
What is that?

400
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,512
The club within the club.

401
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:34,515
The real club.

402
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:38,561
It's a mob hangout.

403
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,438
Is that where you work?

404
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:43,557
Selina?

405
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:50,949
No, I just work the bar upstairs.

406
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,954
But I see 'em come in.

407
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:57,246
Who?

408
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,249
A lot of guys that shouldn't be there,
I can tell you that.

409
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,504
Your basic upstanding citizen types.

410
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:08,299
You're gonna help me on this.

411
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:10,426
For your friend.

412
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,355
You got a lot of cats.

413
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,775
I have a thing about strays.

414
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,239
You're not safe here.

415
00:41:32,365 --> 00:41:33,565
I can take care of myself.

416
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:36,411
Two public figures now dead
in just the last two nights,

417
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,037
and only days before the election.

418
00:41:38,121 --> 00:41:41,374
Police and city officials
are left searching for a killer

419
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:44,293
and hoping to find him
before he kills again.

420
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:05,481
He waited for him at the gym.

421
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:08,651
Pete always liked to work out
late at night,

422
00:42:08,735 --> 00:42:10,862
when no one else was around.

423
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:13,406
There's a needle mark on his neck.

424
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,450
Injected him with arsenic.

425
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:18,786
Rat poison.

426
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:21,164
Yeah.

427
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:23,791
That seems to be his theme here.

428
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,710
Look at this thing.

429
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:35,595
It's a maze.

430
00:42:38,181 --> 00:42:41,476
What kind of demented son of a bitch
does this to a person?

431
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,428
More symbols.

432
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,400
It's another cipher.

433
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:52,236
He blasted these out
after his message went viral.

434
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:55,490
Bastard murders you and your reputation.

435
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,701
That guy pushes drops. On the east end.

436
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:01,621
I don't get it.

437
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:04,082
Why would Pete get involved
in something like this?

438
00:43:04,999 --> 00:43:07,001
Looks like he got greedy.

439
00:43:07,031 --> 00:43:08,181
You kidding me?

440
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:10,922
After everything we did
to take down the Maronis?

441
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:14,258
We busted their entire operation,
then he caves to some lowlife dealer?

442
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:16,552
Maybe he's not who you thought.

443
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:20,139
You make it sound like he had it coming.

444
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:23,851
He was a cop.

445
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:26,479
Crossed a line.

446
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,387
"I'm mad about you.

447
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:03,141
Want to know my name?
Just look inside and see."

448
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:13,359
"Follow the maze until you find the rat.

449
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:17,113
Bring him into the light,
and you'll find where I'm at."

450
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,906
The hell is that?

451
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:22,827
"Bring him into the light"?
"Find the rat"?

452
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:25,454
I don't know.

453
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,530
Lieutenant.

454
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:29,000
They're coming back.

455
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,334
We got to get out of here.

456
00:44:34,422 --> 00:44:35,631
Come on.

457
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:41,920
Ow!

458
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,557
I don't know about these things.

459
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,102
I need to see in there,
this hunting ground.

460
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:54,692
Hey, why am I starting to feel
like a fish on a hook?

461
00:44:56,569 --> 00:44:58,029
I'm just looking for Annika.

462
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:03,951
Boy, you're a real sweetheart.

463
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,705
You really don't care what happens to me
in there tonight, do you?

464
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:18,466
Look at me.

465
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,269
Looks good. Here.

466
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,439
I got you. Can you hear me?

467
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:17,599
Yeah.

468
00:46:26,075 --> 00:46:27,275
Hey, where you goin'?

469
00:46:27,702 --> 00:46:28,902
Hospitality.

470
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:32,415
That's one of the guys
I got into it with the other night.

471
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,710
Looks like I broke his nose.

472
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:44,468
"Kenzie, William."

473
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:46,012
He's an off-duty cop.

474
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:49,557
Are you sure no one can see
these things in my eyes?

475
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,934
Don't worry. I'm watching you.

476
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:11,620
Don't look away.
I need time to make IDs.

477
00:47:11,704 --> 00:47:12,904
Great.

478
00:47:20,087 --> 00:47:22,381
These guys have a little problem
with eye contact, don't they?

479
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:24,050
Feels good, doesn't it?

480
00:47:24,133 --> 00:47:26,344
Yeah, baby. Feels real good.

481
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:34,018
Jesus, I hate dropheads.

482
00:47:34,048 --> 00:47:35,197
Really?

483
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:36,240
"Cause when I first saw you,

484
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,480
it looked like you were
dealing for Penguin.

485
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:39,815
You don't know
what you're talking about. Can we not...

486
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:42,193
Can we not do this right now?

487
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:45,654
Wait. Who was that?

488
00:47:45,738 --> 00:47:46,938
Oh, I saw him.

489
00:47:46,968 --> 00:47:48,127
Look back.

490
00:47:48,157 --> 00:47:49,950
If I look back, it's gonna be
a whole can of worms.

491
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:51,369
I need to see his face.

492
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:54,497
Jesus.

493
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:03,705
That's the DA.

494
00:48:03,735 --> 00:48:04,852
Gil Colson.

495
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,550
And he's coming over. You happy?

496
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:07,843
Talk to him.

497
00:48:10,909 --> 00:48:12,109
Hey. How you doing?

498
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,277
Hi.

499
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:14,507
I'm Gil.

500
00:48:15,351 --> 00:48:16,977
Hey, aren't you the DA?

501
00:48:17,007 --> 00:48:18,199
Yeah.

502
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:20,398
Wow. I've seen you on TV.

503
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:21,857
Is that right?

504
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:24,485
I haven't seen you around here before.

505
00:48:25,486 --> 00:48:27,530
It's a hell of a time
to be the new girl,

506
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:30,157
'cause people are all a little on edge.

507
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:31,742
Oh, honey, I live on the edge.

508
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:33,026
Is that right?

509
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:34,328
I like that.

510
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,800
Do you want to come over?

511
00:48:35,830 --> 00:48:37,030
Sure.

512
00:48:39,959 --> 00:48:41,293
- This is Travis.
- Hey.

513
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:42,795
You wanna take a seat over there?

514
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:44,964
- Richie, Glen.
- Hey.

515
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:47,925
That's half the DA's office.

516
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:49,208
You know Carla here, huh?

517
00:48:49,238 --> 00:48:50,272
Hi.

518
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:52,346
That's Cheri. Don't mind her,
she's just taking a break.

519
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:54,306
Drowning our sorrows.

520
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,933
You want a drop?

521
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:58,060
Uh, no, I'm good.
But you enjoy.

522
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,689
Hope you don't mind.

523
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,816
I got a lot on my shoulders
with that psycho running around.

524
00:49:04,087 --> 00:49:05,287
He's wasted.

525
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:06,517
No shit.

526
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:09,228
I like this girl.

527
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:11,073
Oh, hey, I like you too!

528
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:17,955
I mean, this Riddler, he's going after
the most powerful people in the city.

529
00:49:17,985 --> 00:49:19,176
He knows so much.

530
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:20,499
He doesn't know shit, man.

531
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:22,835
What are you talking about?
Yeah, he does! What about that rat...

532
00:49:22,865 --> 00:49:23,889
Hey, hey, Gil, come on.

533
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:25,838
- Think maybe you had a little too much.
- Hey. The rat.

534
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,882
- Slow down.
- Ask him about the rat.

535
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:31,719
Hey, what's this about a rat?

536
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,272
I mean...

537
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:47,693
there was a rat. We had an informant.

538
00:49:48,277 --> 00:49:50,696
We had big-time information
on Salvatore Maroni.

539
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,490
That's how we got him out of
the drops business.

540
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:54,158
He's talking about the Maroni case.

541
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:57,536
But if this guy knows,
it's gonna come out.

542
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,414
And when it does,
this whole city's gonna come apart.

543
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:02,416
Okay, I don't wanna hear this.

544
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,127
This is the kind of pillow talk
that got that Russian girl disappeared.

545
00:50:05,211 --> 00:50:06,462
What do you know about that?

546
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,288
Does anybody want a drink?

547
00:50:09,318 --> 00:50:10,436
I want a drink.

548
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:11,717
Keep him talking.

549
00:50:14,741 --> 00:50:15,941
Wait, where are you going?

550
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,067
She knows Annika.

551
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,516
No, stay on the DA.

552
00:50:18,599 --> 00:50:20,518
I told you I'm looking for my friend.

553
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:24,772
- Where's Annika?
- Out of my face. I don't know you.

554
00:50:24,802 --> 00:50:25,951
Yeah, but you know her. Who took her?

555
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:28,526
- What have you heard? Is she okay?
- Jesus Christ, keep your voice down.

556
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:29,860
What, you got a death wish?

557
00:50:29,944 --> 00:50:32,404
Hey, what's the problem, ladies?

558
00:50:32,488 --> 00:50:35,407
There's no problem. It's just girl talk.

559
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:36,992
Let's keep it festive down here,
all right?

560
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:38,276
Sure thing, Oz.

561
00:50:42,915 --> 00:50:44,115
Hey.

562
00:50:44,542 --> 00:50:45,742
Hey.

563
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:49,964
Been a long time
since I seen you down here.

564
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:52,466
How you been?

565
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:56,512
Yeah, I've been okay.

566
00:50:57,846 --> 00:50:59,223
I was just...

567
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:03,102
I was just headed back upstairs.

568
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:05,052
Well...

569
00:51:05,938 --> 00:51:07,606
don't be a stranger.

570
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:24,081
- You know Carmine Falcone.
- I told you it's a mob spot.

571
00:51:24,164 --> 00:51:25,749
You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.

572
00:51:25,833 --> 00:51:27,626
I don't have
a relationship with him, okay?

573
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:29,545
- Well, that's not what it looked like.
- Forget it.

574
00:51:29,575 --> 00:51:30,766
Wait, what are you doing?

575
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:33,215
- Listen, I can't do this anymore.
- No! No!

576
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:39,003
Taxi!

577
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:43,966
Hey!

578
00:51:45,415 --> 00:51:46,615
I lost you in there.

579
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:47,845
Yeah, I gotta go.

580
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:50,024
Oh, you need a ride?

581
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:52,026
That's me right there.

582
00:51:58,053 --> 00:51:59,253
Taxi!

583
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:00,483
I'm good.

584
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:03,537
I hope, uh...

585
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,543
I'll see you around.

586
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:40,008
Just hold still.

587
00:54:38,129 --> 00:54:39,329
What do you know about

588
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,653
a confidential informant
in the Maroni case?

589
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:46,450
Yeah, sure, there was.

590
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:48,994
That's the rat we're looking for.

591
00:54:49,912 --> 00:54:51,789
Somehow Riddler knows who he is.

592
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:55,375
If we find the rat,
maybe it'll lead us to him.

593
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:56,919
Where are you getting this?

594
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:59,880
I have a source
who spoke to the DA tonight.

595
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:02,132
Gil's very nervous.

596
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:05,636
I think the killer's targeting
people close to that case.

597
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,596
I worked that case.

598
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:09,640
Riddler's not after you.

599
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:10,923
How do you know?

600
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:12,434
You're not corrupt.

601
00:55:13,477 --> 00:55:15,020
Colson's dirty?

602
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:22,402
Maybe I, uh...

603
00:55:23,070 --> 00:55:26,406
I go after him.
Lean on him to give up the rat.

604
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:29,785
It's too dangerous.
They made a secret deal with this guy.

605
00:55:30,536 --> 00:55:32,329
Who knows how many people it touches.

606
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:35,624
Politicians. Police. The courts.

607
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:38,627
It could tear the whole city apart.

608
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:41,088
Jesus, this is a powder keg.

609
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:44,466
And Riddler's the match.

610
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:46,542
You know Carmine Falcone.

611
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:47,886
I told you it's a mob spot.

612
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:49,388
You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.

613
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:50,973
I don't have a relationship...

614
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,600
You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.

615
00:55:53,684 --> 00:55:55,352
I don't have
a relationship with him. Okay?

616
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:57,938
You know Carmine Falcone.

617
00:55:57,968 --> 00:55:59,117
I told you it's a mob spot.

618
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:00,774
You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.

619
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:02,693
I don't have
a relationship with him. Okay?

620
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:04,027
Pretty.

621
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:07,406
She a new friend of yours?

622
00:56:11,994 --> 00:56:13,203
I'm not so sure.

623
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:15,539
Looks like you upset her.

624
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:18,834
Shall I take this as a good sign?

625
00:56:18,864 --> 00:56:19,972
What?

626
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:20,973
Your attire.

627
00:56:21,003 --> 00:56:23,130
Is Bruce Wayne making
an actual appearance?

628
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:25,215
There's a public memorial
for Mayor Mitchell.

629
00:56:25,299 --> 00:56:27,968
Serial killers like to
follow reactions to their crimes.

630
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:30,596
Riddler might not be able to resist.

631
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:32,139
Oh, that reminds me.

632
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:37,269
I've taken the liberty of doing
a little work on this latest cipher.

633
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:39,313
The one from the rat maze.

634
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:42,816
I'm afraid his Spanish is not perfect,

635
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:45,027
but I'm fairly certain
this translates to,

636
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:48,363
"You are El Rata Alada."

637
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:50,407
Rata Alada?

638
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:51,700
"Rat with wings"?

639
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:54,286
It's slang for "pigeon."
Does that mean anything to you?

640
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:55,621
Yeah.

641
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,280
A stool pigeon.

642
00:56:58,457 --> 00:57:00,083
Where are your cufflinks?

643
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:01,367
I couldn't find them.

644
00:57:02,586 --> 00:57:04,546
Well, you can't go out like that.

645
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:06,423
Alfred, I don't want your cufflinks.

646
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:13,388
You have to keep up appearances.
You're still a Wayne.

647
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:17,309
And what about you? Are you a Wayne?

648
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:20,103
Your father gave them to me.

649
00:57:25,859 --> 00:57:28,987
No more lies! No more lies!

650
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:50,133
Mr. Wayne. All right. All right,
you're going straight down there.

651
00:58:02,688 --> 00:58:04,439
Is that Bruce Wayne?

652
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:07,150
Mr. Wayne!
Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne!

653
00:58:16,243 --> 00:58:17,443
Hold it.

654
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:19,830
You good, fellas?

655
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:21,614
Good.

656
00:58:23,542 --> 00:58:24,742
We're good, Mr. Falcone.

657
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:43,636
Sir?

658
00:59:02,936 --> 00:59:04,136
Hey!

659
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:06,168
Give us a wide berth here,
would you, slick?

660
00:59:07,127 --> 00:59:08,962
Hey, watch it, fellas.

661
00:59:09,421 --> 00:59:11,715
You got the prince of the city there.

662
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,386
Some event, huh?

663
00:59:16,470 --> 00:59:19,431
Brought out the one guy in the city
more reclusive than me.

664
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:21,975
Thought you'd never leave the Shoreline.

665
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:23,685
Aren't you afraid
someone'll take a shot at you?

666
00:59:23,769 --> 00:59:25,771
Why? 'Cause your father ain't around?

667
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:28,065
Oz, you know Bruce Wayne?

668
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,150
Wow. Is that right?

669
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,277
His father saved my life.

670
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:36,448
I got shot in the chest. Right here.

671
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:41,161
I couldn't go to no hospital,
so we showed up on his doorstep.

672
00:59:41,453 --> 00:59:44,664
Operated right on the dining room table.

673
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:50,003
Kid here, he saw the whole thing,
up on the stairs looking down.

674
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:53,423
I remember your face.

675
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,385
You don't think that meant something,
he did that?

676
00:59:57,761 --> 00:59:59,888
It meant he took the Hippocratic oath.

677
01:00:01,223 --> 01:00:02,808
"Hippocratic oath."

678
01:00:05,352 --> 01:00:06,561
That's good.

679
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:08,304
Excuse me.

680
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,058
Yes.

681
01:00:26,811 --> 01:00:28,011
Ladies and gentlemen,

682
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,626
thank you all for
coming to today's memorial

683
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:32,087
for our beloved mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.

684
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:33,964
Our program will begin shortly.

685
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:35,465
As a reminder, the family asked that

686
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:36,967
those wishing to honor
the mayor's memory

687
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:38,468
consider a donation to

688
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:40,595
the cause most dear to his heart...

689
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:42,931
...the Gotham Renewal Fund,

690
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:44,224
our city's safety net.

691
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:47,144
What good's a safety net
doesn't catch anybody?

692
01:00:48,228 --> 01:00:51,982
Didn't help my daughter
when she needed it, I can tell you that.

693
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:55,277
The guy was just another
rich scum-sucker.

694
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:58,155
He got what he deserved.

695
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:01,273
Know what I mean?

696
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:04,494
Hey, don't I know you?

697
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:05,778
Bruce Wayne.

698
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:08,540
Why haven't you called me back?

699
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:09,823
I'm sorry?

700
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:12,252
I'm Bella Real. I'm running for mayor.

701
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:13,545
I wouldn't be bothering you here,

702
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:16,298
but your people keep telling me
you're unavailable.

703
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:17,716
Will you walk with me?

704
01:01:22,888 --> 01:01:24,222
Mr. Wayne.

705
01:01:24,306 --> 01:01:25,515
Mr. Wayne.

706
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:29,311
You know, you really could be
doing more for this city.

707
01:01:29,895 --> 01:01:31,730
Your family has
a history of philanthropy,

708
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:34,232
but as far as I can tell,
you're not doing anything.

709
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:36,776
If I'm elected, I want to change that.

710
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:38,653
Thank you.

711
01:01:39,529 --> 01:01:40,729
My God.

712
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:44,868
I'm gonna go pay my respects.
Will you wait for me?

713
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:46,578
I want to continue this.

714
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:51,990
Excuse me.

715
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,587
I'm so sorry for your loss.

716
01:01:57,568 --> 01:01:58,768
Thank you.

717
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:00,550
Excuse me, chief.
Can I talk to you?

718
01:02:01,885 --> 01:02:03,762
Gil Colson is missing.

719
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:05,138
What?

720
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:07,515
He hasn't been heard from
since last night.

721
01:02:07,545 --> 01:02:08,695
Christ, not again.

722
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:10,810
Hey. Mr. Wayne.

723
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:15,148
You got people looking for him, Jim?

724
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:18,109
Sent a couple guys
to his house. Nothing.

725
01:02:18,139 --> 01:02:19,164
What'd his wife say?

726
01:02:19,194 --> 01:02:20,403
She hadn't heard from him.

727
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:16,366
Get out of the car!

728
01:03:16,835 --> 01:03:19,045
Get out of the car and show your hands!

729
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:21,673
Get out!

730
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:33,476
Get 'em up!

731
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,312
Get out! Show 'em!

732
01:03:39,774 --> 01:03:41,359
Christ, it's Colson.

733
01:03:41,443 --> 01:03:43,153
There's a bomb around his neck!

734
01:03:58,209 --> 01:03:59,753
Let's clear this place out now!

735
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,463
We've got to get this place cleared out!

736
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:38,458
Hey, guys, guys. Here we go.

737
01:04:41,461 --> 01:04:42,879
We don't know if he's in on it.

738
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:47,342
What's he looking at?

739
01:05:06,111 --> 01:05:07,445
Holy shit.

740
01:05:08,488 --> 01:05:10,156
Are you kidding me?

741
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,992
What the hell is he doing? Gordon!

742
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:16,287
Your guy's gonna
get himself killed in there.

743
01:05:32,053 --> 01:05:33,263
Please.

744
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:36,182
- He made me do it.
- I'm so sorry.

745
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:38,810
He told me if I didn't do exactly
what he said, he'd kill me.

746
01:05:38,893 --> 01:05:40,093
I'm so sorry.

747
01:05:40,395 --> 01:05:42,063
Looks like a combination lock.

748
01:05:42,147 --> 01:05:43,606
Can't we just cut it off?

749
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:46,025
Not if you want to keep your head.

750
01:06:22,729 --> 01:06:23,980
You came.

751
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:27,015
Who are you?

752
01:06:27,442 --> 01:06:28,642
Me?

753
01:06:30,862 --> 01:06:32,447
I'm nobody.

754
01:06:33,907 --> 01:06:36,326
I'm just an instrument,

755
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:40,705
here to unmask the truth
about this cesspool we call a city.

756
01:06:41,185 --> 01:06:42,385
"Unmask"?

757
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:43,615
Yes.

758
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:47,253
Let's do it together, okay?

759
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:49,756
I've been trying to reach you.

760
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:52,759
You're part of this too.

761
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:54,636
How am I a part of this?

762
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:56,638
You'll see.

763
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:58,473
Hey, Chief.
You better take a look at this.

764
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:00,642
Say hello to my followers.

765
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:01,976
We're live.

766
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:05,063
They're here to watch our little trial.

767
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:07,472
Al the moment,

768
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:10,902
the man across from you, Mr. Colson,

769
01:07:10,932 --> 01:07:12,081
is dead.

770
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:14,113
Jesus, can we get somebody out here?
This psycho's gonna kill me!

771
01:07:14,143 --> 01:07:15,210
But wait a minute...

772
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:18,368
Shut up! You deserve
to be dead after what you did!

773
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:21,454
You hear me?

774
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:22,738
Okay.

775
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:33,383
I'm giving you a chance.

776
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:37,303
No one ever gave me a chance.

777
01:07:39,347 --> 01:07:40,547
Now,

778
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:44,185
ever since I was a child,

779
01:07:44,269 --> 01:07:47,855
I've always loved little puzzles.

780
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:50,858
For me, they are a retreat

781
01:07:50,942 --> 01:07:54,279
from the horrors of our world.

782
01:07:54,362 --> 01:07:59,576
Maybe they can bring
some comfort to you too, Mr. Colson.

783
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:01,911
You want me to do puzzles?

784
01:08:01,995 --> 01:08:04,747
Three riddles in two minutes.

785
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:08,918
You give me the answers,
and I'll give you the code for the lock.

786
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:11,337
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

787
01:08:11,421 --> 01:08:13,590
Okay, okay. So I just...

788
01:08:13,652 --> 01:08:14,852
You want me to...

789
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:17,218
Riddle number one...

790
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:20,930
"It can be cruel, poetic, or blind,

791
01:08:21,014 --> 01:08:25,685
but when it's denied,
it's violence you may find."

792
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:28,187
Wait, wait, wait! Can you repeat that?

793
01:08:28,217 --> 01:08:29,409
"Cruel"? "Poetic"?

794
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:30,857
- "Justice."
- Huh?

795
01:08:30,887 --> 01:08:32,036
The answer's "justice."

796
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:33,276
- Justice?
- Yes!

797
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:34,944
- Oh, God.
- Justice!

798
01:08:35,028 --> 01:08:39,365
And you were supposed
to be an arm of justice in this city,

799
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:41,826
along with the late mayor
and police commissioner,

800
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:44,287
were you not, Mr. Colson?

801
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:45,580
Of course, of course. Of course.

802
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:48,041
Riddle number two.

803
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:52,253
"If you are justice, please do not lie.

804
01:08:52,337 --> 01:08:56,507
What is the price for your blind eye?"

805
01:08:56,591 --> 01:08:58,384
- "The price"?
- "Bribes."

806
01:08:58,468 --> 01:08:59,719
Oh, God. "Bribes"?

807
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:01,971
He's asking you how much it cost
for you to turn your back.

808
01:09:03,369 --> 01:09:04,569
Fifty-eight seconds!

809
01:09:04,599 --> 01:09:05,850
- How much?
- Nothing!

810
01:09:05,933 --> 01:09:08,144
- How much?
- Ten grand. Ten Gs a month.

811
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:10,521
I get a monthly payment
just not to prosecute certain cases.

812
01:09:10,551 --> 01:09:11,492
What cases?

813
01:09:11,522 --> 01:09:12,702
He didn't ask me that!

814
01:09:12,732 --> 01:09:13,932
Come on! Ten grand.

815
01:09:14,192 --> 01:09:17,153
- That's my answer. It's ten grand!
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

816
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:19,864
Don't lose your head, Mr. Colson.

817
01:09:19,947 --> 01:09:23,785
Just one more to go
before your time runs out.

818
01:09:23,868 --> 01:09:26,287
Last riddle.

819
01:09:26,371 --> 01:09:30,708
"Since your justice is so select,

820
01:09:30,792 --> 01:09:35,088
please tell us which vermin
you're paid to protect."

821
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:37,256
- "Which vermin"?
- The rat.

822
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:39,884
The informant you all protect
from the Salvatore Maroni case.

823
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:41,761
- How do you know about that?
- What's his name?

824
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:43,054
Twenty seconds.

825
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:44,806
- No.
- He's gonna kill you.

826
01:09:44,889 --> 01:09:46,849
I'm a dead man either way.
You're talking to a dead man, okay?

827
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:48,476
If 1 go out this way, it's just me.

828
01:09:48,559 --> 01:09:51,688
But if I give over that name,
I have family, people I love.

829
01:09:51,771 --> 01:09:53,231
- He'll kill them too.
- Who will?

830
01:09:53,314 --> 01:09:54,649
- People are watching.
- What people?

831
01:09:54,732 --> 01:09:56,859
It's so much bigger
than you could ever imagine.

832
01:09:56,943 --> 01:09:59,112
- It's the whole system!
- Five!

833
01:09:59,142 --> 01:10:00,124
Four!

834
01:10:00,154 --> 01:10:01,531
- Oh, God, have mercy on me...
- Three!

835
01:10:01,614 --> 01:10:03,491
Goodbye!

836
01:10:33,688 --> 01:10:35,064
Who do you think he is under there?

837
01:10:35,094 --> 01:10:36,035
Take it easy.

838
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:37,265
I want to see.

839
01:10:38,401 --> 01:10:39,610
What is that thing? Leather?

840
01:10:43,364 --> 01:10:44,824
What's he got on his eyes?

841
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:46,367
Who cares?
I want to see his face.

842
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:47,660
What are we doing here?
Let's just take it off...

843
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:48,944
Hey!

844
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:52,623
Hey! Hey! Hey!

845
01:10:52,707 --> 01:10:54,375
Relax, God damn it!

846
01:10:54,459 --> 01:10:55,960
You're protecting this guy, Jim?

847
01:10:57,378 --> 01:10:59,922
He interfered in
an active hostage situation.

848
01:11:00,006 --> 01:11:02,425
Colson's blood is on his hands.

849
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:03,926
Maybe it's on yours.

850
01:11:05,282 --> 01:11:06,482
What'd you say?

851
01:11:06,512 --> 01:11:08,097
He would rather die than talk.

852
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:10,183
What was he afraid of?

853
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:12,133
You?

854
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:20,568
You son of a bitch.

855
01:11:21,152 --> 01:11:24,155
You have any idea
what kind of trouble you're in?

856
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:25,948
You could be an accessory to murder.

857
01:11:25,978 --> 01:11:27,128
Why are we playing games...

858
01:11:28,889 --> 01:11:30,089
Get him! Come on!

859
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:32,121
Back off! Back off!

860
01:11:32,205 --> 01:11:34,499
Great, now I got you
on assaulting an officer!

861
01:11:34,582 --> 01:11:36,667
- You got me on assaulting three.
- Hey!

862
01:11:36,751 --> 01:11:39,545
What's the matter with you?
This isn't the way to do this!

863
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:43,758
You too now?

864
01:11:43,841 --> 01:11:46,385
Let me handle this, Chief.
Just give me a minute.

865
01:11:46,469 --> 01:11:49,055
You're gonna put yourself on the line
for this scumbag, Jim?

866
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:51,390
Just give me a minute.
I'll get him to cooperate.

867
01:11:54,185 --> 01:11:55,686
Okay, give him the room.

868
01:12:11,327 --> 01:12:12,620
Two minutes.

869
01:12:24,382 --> 01:12:25,967
You listen to me.

870
01:12:27,552 --> 01:12:29,554
We gotta get you out of here.

871
01:12:31,222 --> 01:12:33,182
That would put a lot of heat on you.

872
01:12:33,266 --> 01:12:34,934
Well, you punched me in the face.

873
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:38,479
Take this key.

874
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:43,150
Through that door. Hallway to the stairs
that go to the roof.

875
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:45,903
Hey, what the hell
is going on here?

876
01:12:46,904 --> 01:12:49,198
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

877
01:12:52,577 --> 01:12:54,954
Who's the mustache with the broken nose?

878
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:01,085
That's Kenzie. Narcotics.

879
01:13:01,168 --> 01:13:04,088
He's one of the guys I got into it with
at the Iceberg Lounge.

880
01:13:05,006 --> 01:13:07,633
What are you saying?
Kenzie moonlights for the Penguin?

881
01:13:10,344 --> 01:13:12,305
Or he moonlights as a cop.

882
01:13:16,893 --> 01:13:18,394
- Jesus Christ!
- Go!

883
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:19,979
Somebody stop him!

884
01:13:58,184 --> 01:13:59,727
- There he is!
- Freeze!

885
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:48,025
Could have at least
pulled that punch, man.

886
01:14:48,567 --> 01:14:49,777
I did.

887
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:53,239
Bock put out an APB on you.
You really think he's in on this?

888
01:14:53,322 --> 01:14:55,366
I don't trust any of 'em. Do you?

889
01:14:55,429 --> 01:14:56,629
I only trust you.

890
01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:58,995
What's a narcotics cop doing
with Falcone's right-hand man?

891
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:02,456
Colson said, "Cops protect the rat."
Maybe Kenzie's part of it.

892
01:15:03,187 --> 01:15:04,387
You think Penguin's the rat?

893
01:15:04,417 --> 01:15:07,461
His club caters to the mob.
Maroni practically lived there.

894
01:15:07,545 --> 01:15:09,505
Penguin would have been
privy to a lot of dirt.

895
01:15:09,588 --> 01:15:10,923
DA was a regular too.

896
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:14,510
Maybe Penguin got himself into a jam
and working a deal was his only way out.

897
01:15:15,594 --> 01:15:16,804
The Rata Alada.

898
01:15:16,834 --> 01:15:17,900
The what?

899
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:19,390
Riddler's latest.

900
01:15:19,473 --> 01:15:21,183
The cipher in the maze.

901
01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:23,769
It means "a rat with wings."
Like a stool pigeon.

902
01:15:25,354 --> 01:15:26,981
A penguin's got wings too.

903
01:15:28,983 --> 01:15:30,943
Time for me
to have another conversation with him.

904
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:32,695
What about the Riddler?
He's gonna kill again.

905
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:35,990
It's all connected.
Like it or not, it's his game now.

906
01:15:36,073 --> 01:15:39,243
You want to find Riddler,
we gotta find that rat.

907
01:15:41,871 --> 01:15:43,706
Kenzie and the twins, coming your way.

908
01:15:44,812 --> 01:15:46,012
There's Penguin.

909
01:15:46,042 --> 01:15:47,918
I wonder what's in the bags.

910
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:50,796
You want to move in?

911
01:15:52,673 --> 01:15:54,133
Let's follow.

912
01:16:12,651 --> 01:16:16,197
They stopped at Waterfront Street.
The recycling plant.

913
01:16:16,322 --> 01:16:17,573
I'm here.

914
01:16:18,991 --> 01:16:20,659
- How you doing?
- Yeah, good. How are you?

915
01:16:20,743 --> 01:16:23,245
Good, good.
Let's get in out of this deluge.

916
01:16:42,473 --> 01:16:45,017
It's a drug lab. Drops.

917
01:16:45,101 --> 01:16:46,310
This is a buy.

918
01:16:46,393 --> 01:16:49,563
Looks like they got Maroni's operation
up and running again.

919
01:16:49,647 --> 01:16:50,847
Or they never shut it down at all.

920
01:16:50,877 --> 01:16:51,827
What are you saying?

921
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:54,985
The biggest drug bust in GCPD history
was a fraud?

922
01:17:19,343 --> 01:17:20,761
This just got complicated.

923
01:17:21,512 --> 01:17:22,712
What do you mean?

924
01:17:28,602 --> 01:17:30,062
Hey! What happened?

925
01:17:30,146 --> 01:17:31,480
You all right?

926
01:17:42,199 --> 01:17:43,993
Dangerous crowd you're stealing from.

927
01:17:44,118 --> 01:17:45,744
Jesus.

928
01:17:46,495 --> 01:17:48,330
Is this how you get your kicks, hon?

929
01:17:48,831 --> 01:17:50,166
Sneaking up on girls in the dark?

930
01:17:50,249 --> 01:17:51,959
Is that why you work in the club?

931
01:17:52,606 --> 01:17:53,806
It was all just a score?

932
01:17:53,836 --> 01:17:57,631
I would love to sit and go over
every gory detail with you, bat boy...

933
01:17:59,008 --> 01:18:00,926
but, uh, those assholes are coming back.

934
01:18:12,125 --> 01:18:13,325
Jesus!

935
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,000
Hey, Vengeance!

936
01:18:45,095 --> 01:18:47,806
You think you can
come after my money, huh?

937
01:19:28,681 --> 01:19:30,307
Kenzie! Get the money!

938
01:19:35,729 --> 01:19:36,981
Hey! What the...

939
01:20:27,614 --> 01:20:28,949
Whoa!

940
01:20:32,161 --> 01:20:33,746
Come on! Come on!

941
01:20:36,915 --> 01:20:38,250
This guy's crazy!

942
01:20:40,002 --> 01:20:41,712
Come on! Hey!

943
01:21:31,178 --> 01:21:32,378
Move!

944
01:22:36,994 --> 01:22:38,871
Get out of the way!

945
01:22:50,007 --> 01:22:51,207
Come on!

946
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:01,008
Get out of the way!

947
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:40,224
I got you!

948
01:23:41,475 --> 01:23:42,809
I got you!

949
01:23:42,893 --> 01:23:45,229
Take that, you friggin' psycho!

950
01:23:45,312 --> 01:23:46,772
I got you!

951
01:25:03,223 --> 01:25:06,059
What the hell is this?
Good cop, batshit cop?

952
01:25:06,143 --> 01:25:08,770
- Who's the Riddler?
- Riddler? How should I know?

953
01:25:08,854 --> 01:25:10,147
Let's make it easy for you, Oz.

954
01:25:10,230 --> 01:25:11,648
Cops caught you doing something.

955
01:25:11,732 --> 01:25:13,358
They were gonna shut you down,
put you away.

956
01:25:13,442 --> 01:25:15,319
So you gave up a bigger fish
to save your ass.

957
01:25:15,402 --> 01:25:17,529
You ratted out Salvatore Maroni.

958
01:25:17,613 --> 01:25:18,822
His drops operation.

959
01:25:18,905 --> 01:25:21,366
But the cops, the city officials,
the mayor, the DA,

960
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:25,078
they got greedy, right?
Wasn't enough, a big career-making bust.

961
01:25:25,162 --> 01:25:26,913
They wanted to take over
the drops business too,

962
01:25:26,997 --> 01:25:29,333
but they needed a minor league mope
like you to run it.

963
01:25:29,416 --> 01:25:32,628
You don't just work for Carmine Falcone.
You work for them too.

964
01:25:32,711 --> 01:25:33,911
What are you, crazy?

965
01:25:33,941 --> 01:25:35,100
That why you killed the girl?

966
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:36,143
I didn't kill no girl!

967
01:25:36,173 --> 01:25:37,966
We know she worked for you
at the 44 Below.

968
01:25:38,050 --> 01:25:39,343
But she got too close, right?

969
01:25:39,426 --> 01:25:41,637
Found out from Mitchell that you were
the rat, so you killed her.

970
01:25:41,720 --> 01:25:43,680
But somehow Riddler found out too.

971
01:25:43,764 --> 01:25:45,682
He knows so much about you.

972
01:25:45,766 --> 01:25:47,809
- You must know about him.
- Who is he?

973
01:25:48,393 --> 01:25:50,604
Boy, you guys are a hell of a duet here.

974
01:25:51,021 --> 01:25:52,221
Why don't you start harmonizing?

975
01:25:52,522 --> 01:25:55,192
There's only one problem
with your little scenario, okay?

976
01:25:55,275 --> 01:25:56,610
I ain't no rat!

977
01:25:56,693 --> 01:25:58,528
You got any idea what Carmine Falcone
would do to me

978
01:25:58,558 --> 01:25:59,750
if he heard this kind of talk?

979
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:01,948
Oh, you don't wanna
talk about rats, huh?

980
01:26:02,032 --> 01:26:04,576
Maybe we can talk about
what they did to my partner's face.

981
01:26:04,660 --> 01:26:06,203
Holy God, what are you showing me here?

982
01:26:06,286 --> 01:26:07,913
- This was around his head!
- Come on!

983
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:09,915
Open your eyes!

984
01:26:13,835 --> 01:26:15,420
Are you El Rata Alada?

985
01:26:15,504 --> 01:26:17,005
El Rata Alada?

986
01:26:17,089 --> 01:26:18,924
Yeah, a "rat with wings."
A stool pigeon.

987
01:26:19,007 --> 01:26:21,343
That's not you?
The symbols in the maze, right here.

988
01:26:21,426 --> 01:26:24,012
It says you are El Rata Alada.

989
01:26:24,096 --> 01:26:25,472
"You are El Rata"? It says that?

990
01:26:25,555 --> 01:26:26,765
Why, you got something to tell us?

991
01:26:26,848 --> 01:26:28,048
Yeah!

992
01:26:28,288 --> 01:26:29,488
It's, like, the worst Spanish
I ever heard.

993
01:26:29,518 --> 01:26:30,718
What?

994
01:26:30,769 --> 01:26:32,104
It's "La."

995
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:33,480
"La" rata.

996
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:35,982
What, is this Riddler stupid
or something?

997
01:26:36,066 --> 01:26:37,943
Jesus! Look at you two.

998
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:40,612
World's greatest detectives!

999
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:43,323
Am I the only here knows the difference
between "el" and "la"?

1000
01:26:43,353 --> 01:26:44,544
Jesus!

1001
01:26:44,574 --> 01:26:46,076
No habla espanol, fellas?

1002
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:48,161
Do me a favor, shithead, shut up!

1003
01:26:49,517 --> 01:26:50,717
You think he made a mistake?

1004
01:26:50,747 --> 01:26:51,957
He doesn't make mistakes.

1005
01:26:51,987 --> 01:26:53,136
A rat with wings?

1006
01:26:53,166 --> 01:26:54,751
You know what that sounds like to me?

1007
01:26:54,835 --> 01:26:58,004
A friggin' bat! Huh?
You ever think of that?

1008
01:26:58,088 --> 01:27:00,090
"You are El Rata."

1009
01:27:05,721 --> 01:27:09,599
"You are el."

1010
01:27:18,275 --> 01:27:19,776
Maybe it was a mistake.

1011
01:27:19,881 --> 01:27:21,081
Maybe he isn't as smart as...

1012
01:27:21,111 --> 01:27:22,311
Wait.

1013
01:27:25,365 --> 01:27:26,700
Is that him?

1014
01:27:27,576 --> 01:27:29,411
Holy shit.

1015
01:27:49,306 --> 01:27:50,891
What the hell does that mean?
Is he or isn't he?

1016
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:23,924
"I grew up from a seed, tough as a weed.

1017
01:28:24,007 --> 01:28:26,843
But in a mansion, in a slum,

1018
01:28:26,927 --> 01:28:28,845
I'll never know where I come from.

1019
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:31,056
Do you know what I am?"

1020
01:28:31,139 --> 01:28:32,339
Any idea?

1021
01:28:32,682 --> 01:28:33,882
Yeah.

1022
01:28:35,101 --> 01:28:36,353
It's an orphan.

1023
01:28:45,237 --> 01:28:46,988
A mansion in a slum.

1024
01:28:48,532 --> 01:28:51,117
- He's talking about the old orphanage.
- The one that burned down?

1025
01:28:51,201 --> 01:28:52,911
It was part of the Wayne estate.

1026
01:28:53,537 --> 01:28:55,121
They donated it
after they built the tower.

1027
01:28:55,205 --> 01:28:56,405
Let's go.

1028
01:28:59,292 --> 01:29:01,753
You guys realize I'm still here, right?

1029
01:29:02,796 --> 01:29:04,172
You gonna untie me?

1030
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:05,715
How the hell
am I supposed to get out of here?

1031
01:29:09,636 --> 01:29:10,836
Hey!

1032
01:29:12,097 --> 01:29:14,516
You goddamn sons of bitches!

1033
01:29:28,613 --> 01:29:30,782
No guns.

1034
01:29:32,242 --> 01:29:34,286
Yeah, man. That's your thing.

1035
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:56,600
What's that?

1036
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:09,029
Hey! Hey!

1037
01:30:15,493 --> 01:30:16,703
Dropheads.

1038
01:30:24,127 --> 01:30:25,754
What the hell is that?

1039
01:30:37,515 --> 01:30:39,893
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1040
01:30:39,976 --> 01:30:41,269
Wasn't that beautiful?

1041
01:30:44,022 --> 01:30:46,066
Thank you all. Thank you, uh...

1042
01:30:46,483 --> 01:30:48,068
Thank you for coming today.

1043
01:30:49,819 --> 01:30:51,404
I believe in Gotham.

1044
01:30:52,697 --> 01:30:54,491
I believe in its promise.

1045
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:59,162
But too many have been left behind
for too long,

1046
01:30:59,704 --> 01:31:01,498
and that's why I'm here today.

1047
01:31:01,581 --> 01:31:04,417
To announce,
not only my candidacy for mayor,

1048
01:31:04,501 --> 01:31:07,837
but also the creation
of the Gotham Renewal Fund.

1049
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:10,256
Win or lose,

1050
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:13,134
the Wayne Foundation pledges
a $1 billion donation

1051
01:31:13,593 --> 01:31:16,429
lo start a charitable endowment
for public works.

1052
01:31:17,013 --> 01:31:21,059
I want to bypass political gridlock,
and get money to people and projects

1053
01:31:21,142 --> 01:31:23,061
who need it now,

1054
01:31:23,144 --> 01:31:24,604
like these children behind me.

1055
01:31:24,688 --> 01:31:26,106
"Sins of the father."

1056
01:31:26,189 --> 01:31:28,650
Renewal is about growth.
It is about planting seeds...

1057
01:31:31,111 --> 01:31:33,196
...and renewing Gotham's promise.

1058
01:31:37,075 --> 01:31:39,285
Shall be visited upon the son.

1059
01:31:41,287 --> 01:31:44,416
Jesus. His next victim is Bruce Wayne.

1060
01:31:49,004 --> 01:31:50,422
Hey!

1061
01:32:50,106 --> 01:32:52,650
- Hello?
- Dory! I need to speak to Alfred!

1062
01:32:52,734 --> 01:32:54,569
- Oh, Mr. Wayne...
- Listen to me!

1063
01:32:54,652 --> 01:32:56,279
Something terrible is gonna happen!

1064
01:32:56,946 --> 01:32:59,032
I'm afraid it already has, sir.

1065
01:33:10,835 --> 01:33:12,587
About an hour ago.

1066
01:33:13,755 --> 01:33:15,423
I'm so sorry.

1067
01:33:16,883 --> 01:33:18,635
I've been trying to reach you.

1068
01:33:21,387 --> 01:33:23,056
The package was intended for you.

1069
01:33:23,598 --> 01:33:27,352
It was a C-4 explosive sent in a mailer.
We found this too.

1070
01:33:50,083 --> 01:33:51,709
We've sedated him.

1071
01:33:51,793 --> 01:33:53,419
We just have to hope he stabilizes.

1072
01:33:54,295 --> 01:33:57,006
You should go home, Mr. Wayne.
Get some sleep.

1073
01:33:57,549 --> 01:33:59,300
Is there anyone else to notify?

1074
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:02,053
Next of kin?

1075
01:34:07,183 --> 01:34:08,383
No.

1076
01:34:09,394 --> 01:34:11,020
It's just me.

1077
01:35:54,123 --> 01:35:55,375
Selina?

1078
01:36:02,006 --> 01:36:03,206
Can you see me?

1079
01:36:06,135 --> 01:36:08,554
- Yeah, I can see you.
- Ineed to talk to you.

1080
01:36:09,430 --> 01:36:10,630
Where can we go?

1081
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:31,119
Cat burglar pulling another score?

1082
01:36:32,203 --> 01:36:34,664
- What?
- Wasn't sure I'd see you again.

1083
01:36:34,747 --> 01:36:37,208
Yeah, well, things were getting
a little hot for me, so...

1084
01:36:37,875 --> 01:36:39,627
How could they do that to her?

1085
01:36:39,711 --> 01:36:41,671
That piece of shit cop, Kenzie.

1086
01:36:41,754 --> 01:36:43,673
Her body was in his car.

1087
01:36:43,756 --> 01:36:46,634
I'm gonna find him and I'm gonna
make him pay. You gonna help me?

1088
01:36:46,718 --> 01:36:49,721
- Help you?
- Yeah. I thought you were "Vengeance."

1089
01:36:49,804 --> 01:36:51,347
Your friend got involved
with the wrong people.

1090
01:36:51,431 --> 01:36:53,057
She didn't know any better.

1091
01:36:53,141 --> 01:36:54,475
Maybe you should have
explained it to her.

1092
01:36:54,559 --> 01:36:56,102
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

1093
01:36:56,185 --> 01:36:57,687
It means your choices have consequences.

1094
01:36:57,770 --> 01:37:00,148
Jesus Christ. "Choices"?

1095
01:37:00,231 --> 01:37:02,942
You know, whoever the hell you are,
you obviously grew up rich.

1096
01:37:03,026 --> 01:37:04,861
- Was it worth it?
- What?

1097
01:37:05,194 --> 01:37:07,363
Compromising yourself for money?

1098
01:37:08,740 --> 01:37:10,992
What did you have to do
to set up that score?

1099
01:37:12,618 --> 01:37:16,289
How close did you have to get
to Penguin? To Falcone?

1100
01:37:16,372 --> 01:37:17,707
You don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

1101
01:37:17,790 --> 01:37:19,125
Falcone owes me that money.

1102
01:37:19,208 --> 01:37:20,960
- He owes you?
- Yeah, and a lot more.

1103
01:37:20,990 --> 01:37:21,931
Oh, really? Why's that?

1104
01:37:21,961 --> 01:37:22,932
You know what? I can't even talk to you.

1105
01:37:22,962 --> 01:37:24,714
No! I want to know
why a guy like Falcone

1106
01:37:24,744 --> 01:37:25,852
would owe you anything.

1107
01:37:25,882 --> 01:37:28,217
Because he's my father!

1108
01:37:37,352 --> 01:37:40,146
My mother worked at the 44 Below.

1109
01:37:41,647 --> 01:37:42,940
Just like Anni.

1110
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:47,653
She used to take me there
when I was a little girl.

1111
01:37:49,739 --> 01:37:51,074
To the club?

1112
01:37:51,991 --> 01:37:53,191
Yeah.

1113
01:37:55,703 --> 01:37:58,581
I hid out in the dressing room
while she worked.

1114
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,792
Used to see him there.

1115
01:38:01,542 --> 01:38:03,544
He scared the shit out of me.

1116
01:38:05,505 --> 01:38:08,966
And I could never understand
why he looked at me the way he did.

1117
01:38:09,509 --> 01:38:13,346
Then one night,
my mother told me who he was.

1118
01:38:16,724 --> 01:38:19,060
When I was seven,
my mother was murdered.

1119
01:38:19,727 --> 01:38:21,229
Strangled.

1120
01:38:21,646 --> 01:38:25,108
Never found out who.
Probably some creep from the club.

1121
01:38:26,984 --> 01:38:29,070
Anyway, social services
came to take me away,

1122
01:38:29,153 --> 01:38:31,322
and he didn't say a thing.

1123
01:38:33,157 --> 01:38:34,951
Couldn't even look at me.

1124
01:38:38,704 --> 01:38:40,456
He owes me that money.

1125
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:43,668
I'm sorry.

1126
01:38:44,794 --> 01:38:45,994
For what I said.

1127
01:38:47,338 --> 01:38:48,756
Oh, it's all right.

1128
01:38:52,301 --> 01:38:54,387
You assume the worst in people.

1129
01:38:55,304 --> 01:38:56,681
Which, well...

1130
01:38:58,975 --> 01:39:00,893
maybe we're not so different after all.

1131
01:39:06,357 --> 01:39:08,109
Who are you under there?

1132
01:39:14,198 --> 01:39:16,075
What are you hiding?

1133
01:39:18,453 --> 01:39:20,288
Are you just...

1134
01:39:21,873 --> 01:39:23,583
hideously scarred?

1135
01:39:25,710 --> 01:39:26,910
Yeah.

1136
01:39:33,968 --> 01:39:35,386
Listen to me.

1137
01:39:36,929 --> 01:39:39,807
If we don't stand up for Annika,
no one will.

1138
01:39:40,975 --> 01:39:45,646
All anyone cares about in this place
are these white, privileged assholes.

1139
01:39:46,272 --> 01:39:49,358
The mayor, the commissioner, the DA.

1140
01:39:49,442 --> 01:39:50,693
Now Thomas and Bruce Wayne.

1141
01:39:50,776 --> 01:39:52,028
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,

1142
01:39:52,111 --> 01:39:54,155
that psycho's right
to go after these creeps.

1143
01:39:54,238 --> 01:39:55,490
I think you'd be on his side.

1144
01:39:55,573 --> 01:39:57,200
What do you mean,
"Thomas and Bruce Wayne"?

1145
01:39:57,283 --> 01:39:59,243
What, do you live in a cave?

1146
01:39:59,327 --> 01:40:01,412
The Riddler's latest.
It's all about the Waynes.

1147
01:40:02,497 --> 01:40:06,375
Listen, if I can find
that dickbag Kenzie,

1148
01:40:06,459 --> 01:40:07,668
will you help me?

1149
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:10,213
Please.

1150
01:40:13,007 --> 01:40:14,926
Come on, Vengeance.

1151
01:40:17,386 --> 01:40:19,639
Just don't make any moves without me,
understand?

1152
01:40:19,722 --> 01:40:21,349
It's a little more dangerous
than you know...

1153
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:32,443
I told you, baby.

1154
01:40:34,362 --> 01:40:36,948
I can take care of myself.

1155
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:51,045
I'm Thomas Wayne,
and I approve this message.

1156
01:40:58,886 --> 01:41:02,473
From a very young age, my family,
Martha's family, the Arkhams...

1157
01:41:02,598 --> 01:41:04,433
...instilled in both of us

1158
01:41:04,642 --> 01:41:07,061
that giving back
is not just an obligation,

1159
01:41:07,228 --> 01:41:08,688
it's a passion.

1160
01:41:09,397 --> 01:41:11,732
That is our family's legacy.

1161
01:41:12,942 --> 01:41:15,278
The Waynes and the Arkhams.

1162
01:41:15,361 --> 01:41:17,822
Gotham's founding families.

1163
01:41:17,905 --> 01:41:21,075
But what is their real legacy?

1164
01:41:22,410 --> 01:41:27,081
Twenty years ago, one reporter set out
to uncover the dark truth.

1165
01:41:27,164 --> 01:41:30,835
He found shocking family secrets.

1166
01:41:31,544 --> 01:41:33,087
How, when Martha was just a child,

1167
01:41:33,170 --> 01:41:35,673
her mother brutally murdered her father,

1168
01:41:35,756 --> 01:41:37,383
then committed suicide...

1169
01:41:37,466 --> 01:41:43,055
...and how the Arkhams used their power
and money to cover it up.

1170
01:41:43,139 --> 01:41:47,810
How Martha herself was
in and out of institutions for years

1171
01:41:47,893 --> 01:41:50,271
and they didn't want anyone to know.

1172
01:41:51,105 --> 01:41:53,608
Thomas Wayne tried
to force this crusading reporter

1173
01:41:53,691 --> 01:41:57,612
into a hush-money agreement
to save his mayoral campaign.

1174
01:41:57,737 --> 01:41:59,780
But when the reporter refused...

1175
01:42:00,281 --> 01:42:04,577
...Wayne turned to longtime
secret associate Carmine Falcone

1176
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:07,246
and had him murdered!

1177
01:42:07,371 --> 01:42:10,416
The Waynes and the Arkhams,

1178
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:16,255
Gotham's legacy of lies and murder.

1179
01:42:16,756 --> 01:42:19,133
I hope you're listening, Bruce Wayne.

1180
01:42:19,216 --> 01:42:21,594
This is your legacy too.

1181
01:42:21,677 --> 01:42:25,139
And Gotham needs you to answer

1182
01:42:25,222 --> 01:42:28,017
for the sins of your father.

1183
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:31,395
Goodbye.

1184
01:42:37,151 --> 01:42:38,351
Do you know who I am?

1185
01:42:39,842 --> 01:42:41,042
You're Bruce Wayne.

1186
01:42:41,072 --> 01:42:42,948
I wanna see Carmine Falcone.

1187
01:42:53,709 --> 01:42:54,909
See?

1188
01:43:06,013 --> 01:43:08,641
Who is this guy
who invented the ball, right?

1189
01:43:09,392 --> 01:43:11,519
Must have made a fortune.

1190
01:43:11,977 --> 01:43:13,729
If you think about it,
the concept of it, right?

1191
01:43:15,231 --> 01:43:17,692
Briscoe, do you know
how much this sweater cost?

1192
01:43:17,722 --> 01:43:18,829
No, boss.

1193
01:43:18,859 --> 01:43:21,195
$1,183.

1194
01:43:21,779 --> 01:43:23,739
You know why communism failed, right?

1195
01:43:23,823 --> 01:43:25,023
No, boss.

1196
01:43:26,742 --> 01:43:27,993
Austerity.

1197
01:43:30,246 --> 01:43:31,872
All right. All right.

1198
01:43:32,164 --> 01:43:34,542
Look at that. Perfect.

1199
01:43:34,625 --> 01:43:36,377
It's never gonna be that good again.

1200
01:43:38,587 --> 01:43:41,090
Hey, Johnny Slick.

1201
01:43:41,173 --> 01:43:42,373
What are you doing here?

1202
01:43:44,260 --> 01:43:46,095
Give us a moment here, fellas.

1203
01:43:47,012 --> 01:43:48,212
Come on.

1204
01:43:49,974 --> 01:43:51,183
See ya, champ.

1205
01:43:52,184 --> 01:43:53,436
Come on, sweetheart.

1206
01:43:55,396 --> 01:43:56,596
Have a seat.

1207
01:43:58,441 --> 01:44:00,234
I thought I might hear from you.

1208
01:44:01,402 --> 01:44:04,530
This, uh,
Riddler son of a bitch is really...

1209
01:44:06,073 --> 01:44:07,867
stirring things up, huh?

1210
01:44:07,950 --> 01:44:09,660
- Is it true?
- What?

1211
01:44:10,953 --> 01:44:12,580
That reporter business?

1212
01:44:13,914 --> 01:44:15,124
What do you want to know here, kid?

1213
01:44:15,207 --> 01:44:18,002
Did you kill him? For my father?

1214
01:44:18,085 --> 01:44:20,838
Look, your father was in trouble.

1215
01:44:21,714 --> 01:44:23,507
This reporter had some dirt.

1216
01:44:23,591 --> 01:44:25,217
Some very...

1217
01:44:26,385 --> 01:44:30,139
personal stuff about your mother,
her family history.

1218
01:44:30,222 --> 01:44:32,933
Everybody's got their dirty laundry,
that's just how it is.

1219
01:44:33,017 --> 01:44:34,477
But he didn't want
none of it coming out,

1220
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:36,479
not right before the election.

1221
01:44:36,937 --> 01:44:39,231
And your father tried
to pay the guy off,

1222
01:44:39,315 --> 01:44:40,941
but he wasn't going for it.

1223
01:44:41,025 --> 01:44:44,195
So, he came to me.

1224
01:44:44,278 --> 01:44:46,655
Well, I never seen him like that.

1225
01:44:47,490 --> 01:44:49,325
He said, "Carmine,

1226
01:44:50,117 --> 01:44:54,830
I want you to put the fear of God
in this guy."

1227
01:44:57,249 --> 01:45:00,169
And when fear isn't enough...

1228
01:45:00,836 --> 01:45:02,671
Oof. Hmm.

1229
01:45:04,006 --> 01:45:07,343
Your father wanted me to handle it,
so I did.

1230
01:45:08,344 --> 01:45:10,179
I handled it.

1231
01:45:11,889 --> 01:45:13,307
I know.

1232
01:45:13,390 --> 01:45:15,643
You thought your father was a Boy Scout.

1233
01:45:16,894 --> 01:45:18,729
But you'd be surprised

1234
01:45:18,813 --> 01:45:21,190
what even a good man like him

1235
01:45:21,273 --> 01:45:23,859
is capable of in the right situation.

1236
01:45:26,111 --> 01:45:27,571
Do me a favor.

1237
01:45:27,905 --> 01:45:29,949
Don't lose any sleep over it.

1238
01:45:30,658 --> 01:45:32,243
This reporter

1239
01:45:33,077 --> 01:45:34,662
was a lowlife.

1240
01:45:34,745 --> 01:45:36,205
He was on Maroni's payroll.

1241
01:45:37,832 --> 01:45:39,458
- Maroni?
- Oh, yeah.

1242
01:45:40,209 --> 01:45:43,462
He could never stand
your father and I had history.

1243
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:48,384
And after what happened
with that reporter, Maroni was worried

1244
01:45:48,467 --> 01:45:50,803
that your father would be in my pocket,

1245
01:45:51,554 --> 01:45:52,754
forever.

1246
01:45:53,222 --> 01:45:55,266
He would have done anything

1247
01:45:55,349 --> 01:45:57,518
to keep him from becoming mayor.

1248
01:45:57,601 --> 01:45:58,936
You understand?

1249
01:46:00,145 --> 01:46:04,692
Are you saying Salvatore Maroni
got my father killed?

1250
01:46:04,775 --> 01:46:06,819
Do I know it for a fact?

1251
01:46:09,238 --> 01:46:11,323
I'm just saying,
it sure looked that way to me.

1252
01:46:12,700 --> 01:46:14,994
This is what you wanted, huh?

1253
01:46:15,077 --> 01:46:17,496
This little conversation here?

1254
01:46:19,915 --> 01:46:22,084
It's been a long time coming, huh?

1255
01:46:24,712 --> 01:46:26,839
I mean, you ain't a kid no more.

1256
01:47:36,241 --> 01:47:37,534
You lied to me...

1257
01:47:40,371 --> 01:47:41,997
my whole life.

1258
01:47:47,169 --> 01:47:49,213
I spoke to Carmine Falcone.

1259
01:47:52,299 --> 01:47:55,594
He told me what he did for my father.

1260
01:47:59,598 --> 01:48:01,100
About Salvatore Maroni.

1261
01:48:03,102 --> 01:48:05,813
He told you Salvatore Maroni...

1262
01:48:05,896 --> 01:48:07,648
Had my father killed.

1263
01:48:10,109 --> 01:48:12,319
Why didn't you tell me all this?

1264
01:48:15,072 --> 01:48:19,618
All these years
I've spent fighting for him,

1265
01:48:19,702 --> 01:48:22,037
believing that he was a good man.

1266
01:48:22,121 --> 01:48:23,706
He was a good man.

1267
01:48:24,873 --> 01:48:26,583
You listen to me.

1268
01:48:26,667 --> 01:48:30,087
Your father was a good man.

1269
01:48:33,716 --> 01:48:35,634
- He made a mistake.
- A "mistake."

1270
01:48:35,718 --> 01:48:37,636
He had a man killed.

1271
01:48:37,720 --> 01:48:38,920
Why?

1272
01:48:39,972 --> 01:48:43,225
To protect his family image?

1273
01:48:44,309 --> 01:48:45,561
His political aspirations?

1274
01:48:45,644 --> 01:48:49,189
It wasn't to protect the family image,
and he didn't have anyone killed.

1275
01:48:51,775 --> 01:48:53,318
He was protecting your mother.

1276
01:48:54,278 --> 01:48:57,823
He didn't care about his image
or the campaign, any of that.

1277
01:48:57,906 --> 01:49:00,034
He cared about her,

1278
01:49:00,117 --> 01:49:01,410
and you,

1279
01:49:01,493 --> 01:49:04,413
and in a moment of weakness,
he turned to Falcone.

1280
01:49:04,496 --> 01:49:07,958
But he never thought Falcone
would kill that man.

1281
01:49:08,834 --> 01:49:12,171
Your father should have known
that Falcone would do anything

1282
01:49:12,254 --> 01:49:15,382
to finally have something on him
that he could use.

1283
01:49:15,466 --> 01:49:17,301
That's who Falcone is.

1284
01:49:19,553 --> 01:49:21,764
And that was your father's mistake.

1285
01:49:21,847 --> 01:49:23,891
But when Falcone
told him what he'd done,

1286
01:49:23,974 --> 01:49:26,727
your father was distraught.

1287
01:49:27,603 --> 01:49:30,814
He told Falcone
he was going to the police,

1288
01:49:30,898 --> 01:49:33,067
that he would confess everything.

1289
01:49:34,568 --> 01:49:36,570
And that night,

1290
01:49:36,653 --> 01:49:40,574
your father and your mother were Killed.

1291
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:47,831
It was Falcone?

1292
01:49:53,879 --> 01:49:56,006
Oh, I wish I knew for sure.

1293
01:50:00,719 --> 01:50:04,264
Or maybe it was some random thug
on the street

1294
01:50:04,348 --> 01:50:07,101
who needed money, got scared,
and pulled the trigger too fast.

1295
01:50:07,184 --> 01:50:12,397
If you don't think I've spent every day
searching for that answer...

1296
01:50:14,149 --> 01:50:18,028
It was my job to protect them.
Do you understand?

1297
01:50:18,695 --> 01:50:20,489
I know you always blamed yourself.

1298
01:50:20,572 --> 01:50:23,117
You were only a boy, Bruce.

1299
01:50:25,285 --> 01:50:27,579
I could see the fear in your eyes,

1300
01:50:28,997 --> 01:50:31,375
but I didn't know how to help.

1301
01:50:31,458 --> 01:50:33,961
I could teach you how to fight,

1302
01:50:35,337 --> 01:50:38,006
but I wasn't equipped
to take care of you.

1303
01:50:38,090 --> 01:50:39,925
You needed a father.

1304
01:50:41,885 --> 01:50:44,304
And all you had was me.

1305
01:50:46,682 --> 01:50:47,891
I'm sorry.

1306
01:50:49,643 --> 01:50:51,562
Don't be sorry, Alfred.

1307
01:50:58,360 --> 01:50:59,560
God.

1308
01:51:02,489 --> 01:51:06,910
I never thought
I'd feel fear like that again.

1309
01:51:09,621 --> 01:51:11,748
I thought I'd mastered all that.

1310
01:51:18,172 --> 01:51:19,423
I mean,

1311
01:51:20,632 --> 01:51:22,759
I'm not afraid to die.

1312
01:51:24,511 --> 01:51:26,889
I realize now there's something.

1313
01:51:28,015 --> 01:51:29,892
I haven't got past.

1314
01:51:30,809 --> 01:51:32,561
This fear...

1315
01:51:35,022 --> 01:51:37,983
of ever going through any of that again.

1316
01:51:42,237 --> 01:51:44,448
Of losing somebody I care about.

1317
01:52:34,853 --> 01:52:36,053
Hey.

1318
01:52:36,083 --> 01:52:38,835
I saw the signal. That's not you?

1319
01:52:38,919 --> 01:52:40,837
I thought it was you.

1320
01:52:53,767 --> 01:52:55,310
- I found him!
- I see that.

1321
01:52:55,394 --> 01:52:56,895
He had my shit and my phone.

1322
01:52:56,979 --> 01:52:58,188
She left a message
the night they took her.

1323
01:52:58,218 --> 01:52:59,243
She called me...

1324
01:52:59,273 --> 01:53:00,983
Gordon! Help me out, man!

1325
01:53:01,066 --> 01:53:02,359
She got my gun!

1326
01:53:03,694 --> 01:53:05,404
- Shut up!
- Put the gun down.

1327
01:53:06,947 --> 01:53:09,491
I'm telling you, God damn it!
She called me!

1328
01:53:14,079 --> 01:53:16,164
Here. Listen.

1329
01:53:18,125 --> 01:53:19,793
Hey! Get back here!

1330
01:53:19,918 --> 01:53:22,087
Where you going? Come back here!

1331
01:53:22,170 --> 01:53:24,256
Hey, hey,
what are you doing, Kenzie?

1332
01:53:24,339 --> 01:53:25,674
You're scaring her.

1333
01:53:25,757 --> 01:53:27,467
I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.

1334
01:53:27,497 --> 01:53:28,647
Please, please, please.

1335
01:53:28,677 --> 01:53:29,970
Please, don't hurt me, please.

1336
01:53:30,053 --> 01:53:32,723
Hey, don't be scared. Come here.

1337
01:53:34,599 --> 01:53:36,643
Now let me ask you again.

1338
01:53:37,352 --> 01:53:39,896
- What did Mitchell tell you?
- No, nothing. He...

1339
01:53:39,980 --> 01:53:42,899
Don liked to talk.
I know that.

1340
01:53:42,983 --> 01:53:45,694
Especially to pretty girls like you.

1341
01:53:46,236 --> 01:53:48,238
That's why I made him
take your passport...

1342
01:53:48,947 --> 01:53:51,825
until we could have
this little conversation.

1343
01:53:51,908 --> 01:53:54,619
All I want to do
is get out of here, okay?

1344
01:53:54,703 --> 01:53:56,830
You'll never hear from me again,
nobody will. Please, please...

1345
01:53:56,913 --> 01:54:00,042
We're gonna get you
out of here, I promise.

1346
01:54:00,876 --> 01:54:03,420
But first, I gotta know...

1347
01:54:04,504 --> 01:54:05,839
What did he tell you?

1348
01:54:06,631 --> 01:54:10,177
He just said
they all made a deal with you.

1349
01:54:10,677 --> 01:54:11,887
Oh. Hmm.

1350
01:54:11,970 --> 01:54:13,930
He told you about that, huh?

1351
01:54:14,014 --> 01:54:15,307
The deal.

1352
01:54:15,390 --> 01:54:20,312
He said you gave some
information on some drops thing

1353
01:54:20,395 --> 01:54:23,106
and that's how he became mayor.

1354
01:54:23,190 --> 01:54:25,567
He said you were a very important man.

1355
01:54:25,650 --> 01:54:26,850
Right.

1356
01:54:27,527 --> 01:54:28,904
Mm-hmm.

1357
01:54:29,863 --> 01:54:32,032
Hmm. Okay.

1358
01:54:39,706 --> 01:54:41,041
Just take it easy.

1359
01:54:41,124 --> 01:54:42,667
Jesus, he's strangling her.

1360
01:54:42,751 --> 01:54:45,796
Take it easy.

1361
01:54:55,013 --> 01:54:56,306
Rata Alada.

1362
01:55:01,061 --> 01:55:02,854
A falcon has wings too.

1363
01:55:03,188 --> 01:55:05,023
Falcone is the rat?

1364
01:55:15,992 --> 01:55:19,162
Falcone works for you guys?

1365
01:55:19,830 --> 01:55:22,374
The mayor? The DA?

1366
01:55:25,377 --> 01:55:26,577
No.

1367
01:55:29,548 --> 01:55:30,841
We work for him.

1368
01:55:31,842 --> 01:55:33,093
Everybody does.

1369
01:55:33,123 --> 01:55:34,231
How?

1370
01:55:34,261 --> 01:55:35,846
Through Renewal.

1371
01:55:36,638 --> 01:55:38,014
Renewal is everything.

1372
01:55:38,098 --> 01:55:39,433
- The Renewal Fund?
- Yeah.

1373
01:55:40,016 --> 01:55:43,728
After Thomas Wayne died,
they all went after it like vultures.

1374
01:55:43,812 --> 01:55:47,399
The mayor, Falcone, Maroni.
Everyone got in on it.

1375
01:55:47,482 --> 01:55:50,861
It was perfect for making bribes,
laundering money.

1376
01:55:50,944 --> 01:55:53,029
A huge charitable fund
with no oversight.

1377
01:55:53,113 --> 01:55:54,823
Everybody got a piece.

1378
01:55:54,906 --> 01:55:56,741
But Falcone wanted more.

1379
01:55:58,535 --> 01:56:01,746
So he orchestrated a play
to take Maroni down big.

1380
01:56:03,165 --> 01:56:05,500
He'd rat out his drops operation,

1381
01:56:05,876 --> 01:56:08,587
make the careers of everybody
that went after him,

1382
01:56:08,670 --> 01:56:11,131
then install them all as his puppets.

1383
01:56:11,214 --> 01:56:13,758
You think this goddamn election matters?

1384
01:56:15,385 --> 01:56:17,304
Falcone's the mayor.

1385
01:56:18,263 --> 01:56:20,765
He's been the mayor
for the last 20 years.

1386
01:56:20,849 --> 01:56:22,225
Come on, Vengeance.

1387
01:56:22,934 --> 01:56:24,769
Let's go kill that son of a bitch.

1388
01:56:25,479 --> 01:56:27,105
- This creep too. Let's finish this.
- Oh, God!

1389
01:56:27,135 --> 01:56:28,118
No!

1390
01:56:29,483 --> 01:56:30,692
We'll get him.

1391
01:56:31,359 --> 01:56:33,236
- But not that way.
- There is no other way!

1392
01:56:33,299 --> 01:56:34,499
He owns the city!

1393
01:56:34,529 --> 01:56:35,780
Cross that line...

1394
01:56:36,573 --> 01:56:37,866
you'll become just like him.

1395
01:56:38,575 --> 01:56:40,118
Listen to me.

1396
01:56:40,202 --> 01:56:42,078
Don't throw your life away.

1397
01:56:48,627 --> 01:56:50,003
Don't worry, honey.

1398
01:56:53,089 --> 01:56:54,549
I got nine of 'em.

1399
01:56:54,674 --> 01:56:56,635
No, don't! Hey, hey!

1400
01:56:57,928 --> 01:56:59,221
Oh, God!

1401
01:57:08,522 --> 01:57:09,722
She won't get out of there alive.

1402
01:57:09,814 --> 01:57:12,400
And if she kills Falcone,
we may never find the Riddler.

1403
01:57:12,430 --> 01:57:13,622
I have to stop her.

1404
01:57:13,652 --> 01:57:14,852
Don't you mean "we"?

1405
01:57:15,946 --> 01:57:17,489
I gotta do this my way.

1406
01:57:17,822 --> 01:57:19,022
And then what?

1407
01:57:19,699 --> 01:57:21,076
We do what Riddler said.

1408
01:57:21,910 --> 01:57:23,537
Bring the rat into the light.

1409
01:57:59,489 --> 01:58:01,533
Can you tell Mr. Falcone
I'd like to come up?

1410
01:58:01,616 --> 01:58:03,076
He ain't seein' nobody tonight.

1411
01:58:03,702 --> 01:58:05,036
Tell him it's about Annika.

1412
01:58:08,290 --> 01:58:09,624
Hey!

1413
01:58:10,458 --> 01:58:11,876
Look who it is, huh?

1414
01:58:11,960 --> 01:58:14,379
- Sorry to bother you.
- Nah. It's fine, beautiful.

1415
01:58:14,462 --> 01:58:16,464
I was just hoping
I could talk to you for a minute?

1416
01:58:16,631 --> 01:58:18,091
Absolutely.

1417
01:58:19,843 --> 01:58:21,043
Alone?

1418
01:58:37,402 --> 01:58:38,602
Hey!

1419
01:58:49,039 --> 01:58:50,248
I'm just so worried.

1420
01:58:50,332 --> 01:58:51,958
I don't know where she is.

1421
01:58:53,710 --> 01:58:57,088
And I know
that you're a very important man.

1422
01:58:57,172 --> 01:59:00,592
I was hoping that maybe
you could help me find her...

1423
01:59:02,093 --> 01:59:04,471
because she's been gone so long,
I'm beginning to...

1424
01:59:05,930 --> 01:59:07,130
I'm sorry.

1425
01:59:07,203 --> 01:59:08,403
It's okay.

1426
01:59:08,433 --> 01:59:10,560
- I'm so sorry.
- I understand. Here.

1427
01:59:10,727 --> 01:59:13,605
No, that's okay, I have a tissue.

1428
01:59:17,630 --> 01:59:18,830
Mr. Falcone?

1429
01:59:18,860 --> 01:59:20,320
Vinnie! Didn't I tell you?

1430
01:59:20,403 --> 01:59:23,323
I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone. I really think
you're gonna want to see this.

1431
01:59:25,700 --> 01:59:27,202
I'm sorry, beautiful.

1432
01:59:27,285 --> 01:59:28,703
I'll be right back.

1433
01:59:44,010 --> 01:59:45,148
Holy shit.

1434
01:59:45,178 --> 01:59:46,846
That recording, provided to GC-1

1435
01:59:46,930 --> 01:59:49,641
by Lieutenant James Gordon
of the Gotham PD.

1436
01:59:49,724 --> 01:59:52,560
And we should warn you,
the contents are extremely graphic

1437
01:59:52,644 --> 01:59:54,854
and some of you may find it disturbing.

1438
01:59:55,480 --> 01:59:58,983
He just said
they all made a deal with you.

1439
01:59:59,109 --> 02:00:00,652
Oh. Hmm.

1440
02:00:00,819 --> 02:00:02,487
He told you about that, huh?

1441
02:00:02,570 --> 02:00:04,072
The deal.

1442
02:00:04,155 --> 02:00:08,952
He said you gave some
information on some drops thing

1443
02:00:09,035 --> 02:00:11,955
and that's how he became mayor.

1444
02:00:12,038 --> 02:00:14,582
He said you were a very important man.

1445
02:00:14,666 --> 02:00:15,866
Right.

1446
02:00:16,543 --> 02:00:17,752
Hmm.

1447
02:00:17,836 --> 02:00:19,045
Okay.

1448
02:00:26,302 --> 02:00:28,680
Revelations of
Mr. Falcone's secret role

1449
02:00:28,763 --> 02:00:30,014
as a mafia informant...

1450
02:00:30,598 --> 02:00:31,850
Hey, Dad.

1451
02:00:32,892 --> 02:00:34,092
What?

1452
02:00:34,352 --> 02:00:36,396
I'm Maria Kyle's kid.

1453
02:00:38,022 --> 02:00:39,482
You remember her?

1454
02:00:41,526 --> 02:00:42,726
Yeah.

1455
02:00:46,802 --> 02:00:48,002
Just put down the gun, honey.

1456
02:00:48,032 --> 02:00:49,232
This is for my mother.

1457
02:01:46,382 --> 02:01:47,582
I see him!

1458
02:02:31,594 --> 02:02:33,346
You don't think this hurts me?

1459
02:02:37,934 --> 02:02:40,228
My own flesh and blood, huh?

1460
02:02:56,619 --> 02:02:58,454
You made me do this.

1461
02:02:59,873 --> 02:03:01,666
Just like your mother.

1462
02:03:07,672 --> 02:03:09,007
He has to pay!

1463
02:03:12,927 --> 02:03:14,127
You don't have to pay with him.

1464
02:03:17,682 --> 02:03:19,183
You paid enough.

1465
02:03:53,739 --> 02:03:54,939
Jesus.

1466
02:03:54,969 --> 02:03:57,680
Look at you, man.
What do you think this is?

1467
02:03:57,764 --> 02:04:00,850
You think you're gonna scare me
with that mask and that cape?

1468
02:04:00,934 --> 02:04:02,185
I'm gonna start crying,

1469
02:04:02,268 --> 02:04:04,771
and all of a sudden,
some big secret's comin' out?

1470
02:04:04,854 --> 02:04:06,481
Let me tell you something.

1471
02:04:06,564 --> 02:04:08,274
Whatever I know,

1472
02:04:08,358 --> 02:04:10,234
whatever I've done,

1473
02:04:10,318 --> 02:04:14,656
it's all going with me to my grave.

1474
02:04:25,208 --> 02:04:27,168
What, are you with Zorro over here?

1475
02:04:28,795 --> 02:04:31,089
Don't you know you boys in blue
work for me?

1476
02:04:39,013 --> 02:04:41,349
I guess we don't all work for you.

1477
02:04:50,358 --> 02:04:51,901
You have the right to remain silent.

1478
02:04:52,735 --> 02:04:56,239
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

1479
02:04:56,322 --> 02:04:57,657
You have the right to an attorney.

1480
02:04:57,740 --> 02:04:58,940
If you cannot afford one,

1481
02:04:58,992 --> 02:05:00,785
the City of Gotham
will provide one to you.

1482
02:05:00,868 --> 02:05:02,578
Do you understand these rights?

1483
02:05:04,080 --> 02:05:05,665
Do you understand?

1484
02:05:07,563 --> 02:05:08,763
Yeah.

1485
02:05:08,793 --> 02:05:10,878
I'll see you when I walk out.

1486
02:05:10,908 --> 02:05:12,016
With these rights in mind,

1487
02:05:12,046 --> 02:05:13,339
is there anything else
you wish to tell...

1488
02:05:13,423 --> 02:05:14,674
Goddamn rat.

1489
02:05:16,634 --> 02:05:17,969
What'd you say?

1490
02:05:18,052 --> 02:05:19,804
Enjoy your night at Blackgate, Carmine.

1491
02:05:20,930 --> 02:05:22,181
Probably be your last.

1492
02:05:22,432 --> 02:05:25,476
Oh-ho. So you're a big man now, Oz?

1493
02:05:25,506 --> 02:05:26,698
Maybe I am.

1494
02:05:26,728 --> 02:05:27,937
Really, Oz?

1495
02:05:28,021 --> 02:05:32,734
Because to me, you were always
just a gimp in an empty suit.

1496
02:05:32,817 --> 02:05:34,017
I'll spray paint your ass!

1497
02:05:37,989 --> 02:05:39,189
What are you doing? It wasn't me!

1498
02:05:39,532 --> 02:05:41,534
I didn't shoot! I didn't shoot!

1499
02:05:42,869 --> 02:05:44,328
Get your hands off of me!

1500
02:06:03,890 --> 02:06:05,892
"Bring him into the light.

1501
02:06:09,479 --> 02:06:11,439
And you'll find where I'm at."

1502
02:06:11,469 --> 02:06:12,660
There!

1503
02:06:12,690 --> 02:06:14,525
The shots came from up there!

1504
02:06:16,090 --> 02:06:17,290
It's Riddler.

1505
02:06:19,197 --> 02:06:20,397
Gage, on me.

1506
02:06:20,448 --> 02:06:23,159
Martinez, around back.
Nobody gets in there, nobody gets out!

1507
02:07:37,358 --> 02:07:38,568
He's gone.

1508
02:07:48,369 --> 02:07:50,329
He's been here this whole time.

1509
02:07:50,413 --> 02:07:52,748
- Lieutenant. Martinez.
- Yeah?

1510
02:07:52,811 --> 02:07:54,011
Lieutenant, we got a witness here,

1511
02:07:54,041 --> 02:07:56,711
says she saw someone coming down
the fire escape right after the shot.

1512
02:07:56,794 --> 02:07:59,255
She said he went into the corner diner.

1513
02:07:59,338 --> 02:08:02,258
The guy's sitting by himself
at the counter, right now.

1514
02:08:17,773 --> 02:08:19,859
Police! Hands up!

1515
02:08:22,904 --> 02:08:26,407
He said put your goddamn
hands up, you son of a bitch.

1516
02:08:45,551 --> 02:08:47,470
I just ordered a slice of pumpkin pie.

1517
02:08:50,431 --> 02:08:51,724
Stay still!

1518
02:08:51,807 --> 02:08:53,007
Now!

1519
02:09:21,462 --> 02:09:23,256
Which one is you?

1520
02:09:23,339 --> 02:09:24,840
You tell me.

1521
02:09:25,675 --> 02:09:27,134
Let's go, pencil-neck.

1522
02:09:30,221 --> 02:09:31,973
Get that son of a bitch out of here!

1523
02:09:46,487 --> 02:09:49,407
...where even murdered
mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.'s wife and son

1524
02:09:49,490 --> 02:09:52,076
have gathered
in an emotional show of city unity.

1525
02:09:52,159 --> 02:09:54,745
Our Dan O'Neil is live
inside Real's headquarters right now...

1526
02:09:54,829 --> 02:09:56,029
Hey.

1527
02:10:20,313 --> 02:10:22,023
What are all these diaries?

1528
02:10:22,106 --> 02:10:24,525
They're ledgers. He's got thousands.

1529
02:10:24,608 --> 02:10:28,154
He scrawled all over 'em.
Rambling, ciphers, codes.

1530
02:10:28,237 --> 02:10:29,780
Got something back on one of the IDs.

1531
02:10:29,864 --> 02:10:32,158
Edward Nashton. Works at KTMJ.

1532
02:10:32,241 --> 02:10:34,076
- He's a forensic accountant.
- Accountant?

1533
02:10:34,160 --> 02:10:36,579
Hey, Lieutenant!
You really okay with this?

1534
02:10:36,662 --> 02:10:38,414
What about chain of evidence?

1535
02:10:39,248 --> 02:10:40,458
You should see this.

1536
02:10:46,422 --> 02:10:47,923
He's wearing gloves.

1537
02:10:49,383 --> 02:10:51,635
"Friday, July 16th.

1538
02:10:51,719 --> 02:10:55,431
My life has been a cruel riddle
I could not solve,

1539
02:10:55,765 --> 02:10:58,809
suffocating my mind, no escape.

1540
02:10:58,893 --> 02:11:00,311
But then, today, I saw it.

1541
02:11:00,394 --> 02:11:04,523
A single word on this ledger,
sitting on the desk beside me.

1542
02:11:05,858 --> 02:11:07,651
'Renewal.'

1543
02:11:07,735 --> 02:11:12,156
The empty promise they sold to me
as a child in that orphanage.

1544
02:11:12,239 --> 02:11:15,368
One look inside,
and finally I understood.

1545
02:11:15,451 --> 02:11:18,788
My whole life
has been preparing me for this.

1546
02:11:18,871 --> 02:11:21,332
The moment when I would learn the truth.

1547
02:11:21,415 --> 02:11:24,418
When I could finally strike back
and expose their lies."

1548
02:11:25,544 --> 02:11:27,380
"If you want people to understand,

1549
02:11:27,463 --> 02:11:29,298
really understand,

1550
02:11:29,382 --> 02:11:31,675
you can't just give them the answers.

1551
02:11:31,759 --> 02:11:33,219
You have to confront them,

1552
02:11:33,302 --> 02:11:35,721
torture them
with the horrifying questions,

1553
02:11:35,805 --> 02:11:37,973
just like they tortured me.

1554
02:11:38,057 --> 02:11:40,851
I know now what I must become."

1555
02:11:43,813 --> 02:11:45,147
Jesus.

1556
02:11:51,237 --> 02:11:53,197
I don't think that rat likes you, man.

1557
02:11:53,739 --> 02:11:55,241
This one's not a rat.

1558
02:12:11,882 --> 02:12:13,082
What is that?

1559
02:12:44,623 --> 02:12:45,833
Some kind of pry tool?

1560
02:12:45,916 --> 02:12:47,293
Is it a chisel?

1561
02:12:47,376 --> 02:12:48,836
It's a murder weapon.

1562
02:12:48,919 --> 02:12:50,296
He killed Mitchell with it.

1563
02:12:50,963 --> 02:12:53,841
The edge will match the floorboard
impression in the mayor's study.

1564
02:13:02,433 --> 02:13:04,435
"My confession"?

1565
02:13:04,518 --> 02:13:07,396
What's he confessing to?
He already told us he killed Mitchell.

1566
02:13:07,480 --> 02:13:08,856
This isn't over.

1567
02:13:08,939 --> 02:13:11,358
Oh, man. He's been posting
all kinds of shit online.

1568
02:13:11,775 --> 02:13:13,986
He's got, like, 500 followers.
Real fringe types.

1569
02:13:22,077 --> 02:13:24,288
His final post was last night.

1570
02:13:24,371 --> 02:13:27,583
Some video. Got a lot of views,
but it's password-protected.

1571
02:13:27,666 --> 02:13:30,669
- Can you get in?
- Copying his drive now.

1572
02:13:30,794 --> 02:13:34,215
Take some time, but we'll get in.

1573
02:13:45,559 --> 02:13:48,103
- Show me the post.
- It's right here.

1574
02:13:49,730 --> 02:13:51,440
"The Truth Unmasked."

1575
02:13:52,274 --> 02:13:53,901
I think I'm his last target.

1576
02:13:56,487 --> 02:13:57,687
You?

1577
02:13:57,947 --> 02:13:59,990
Maybe this is all coming to an end.

1578
02:14:00,533 --> 02:14:01,909
What is?

1579
02:14:02,368 --> 02:14:03,786
The Batman.

1580
02:14:09,166 --> 02:14:10,366
Yeah?

1581
02:14:21,637 --> 02:14:22,846
Right.

1582
02:14:25,724 --> 02:14:29,687
Riddler's asking for you. At Arkham.

1583
02:14:37,152 --> 02:14:38,654
You're a good cop.

1584
02:15:03,262 --> 02:15:05,639
I told you I'd see you in hell.

1585
02:15:06,390 --> 02:15:08,225
What do you want from me?

1586
02:15:08,309 --> 02:15:09,852
"Want"?

1587
02:15:10,436 --> 02:15:14,064
If only you knew how long
I've been waiting for this day.

1588
02:15:15,274 --> 02:15:16,609
For this moment.

1589
02:15:17,651 --> 02:15:20,654
I've been invisible my whole life.

1590
02:15:21,739 --> 02:15:24,366
I guess I won't be anymore, will 1?

1591
02:15:25,909 --> 02:15:28,329
They'll remember me now.

1592
02:15:28,412 --> 02:15:30,247
They'll remember both of us.

1593
02:15:40,633 --> 02:15:42,593
Bruce...

1594
02:15:45,471 --> 02:15:47,306
Wayne.

1595
02:15:49,683 --> 02:15:53,437
Bruce...

1596
02:15:54,855 --> 02:15:57,733
Wayne.

1597
02:16:08,994 --> 02:16:11,413
You know, I was there that day.

1598
02:16:13,999 --> 02:16:17,378
The day the great Thomas Wayne
announced he was running for mayor,

1599
02:16:17,461 --> 02:16:19,838
made all those promises.

1600
02:16:22,299 --> 02:16:26,553
Well, a week later he was dead,
and everybody just forgot about us.

1601
02:16:27,096 --> 02:16:30,641
All they could talk about
was poor Bruce Wayne.

1602
02:16:30,724 --> 02:16:34,395
Bruce Wayne, the orphan.

1603
02:16:34,978 --> 02:16:36,522
Orphan.

1604
02:16:42,194 --> 02:16:47,324
Living in some tower over the park
isn't being an orphan.

1605
02:16:48,617 --> 02:16:53,247
Looking down on everyone,
with all that money.

1606
02:16:53,914 --> 02:16:55,457
Don't you tell me.

1607
02:16:58,085 --> 02:17:00,754
Do you know what being an orphan is?

1608
02:17:01,130 --> 02:17:03,716
It's 30 kids to a room.

1609
02:17:05,008 --> 02:17:09,054
Twelve years old and already a drophead,
numbing the pain.

1610
02:17:10,764 --> 02:17:15,436
You wake up screaming
with rats chewing your fingers.

1611
02:17:16,603 --> 02:17:19,773
And every winter one of the babies die

1612
02:17:19,857 --> 02:17:22,151
because it's so cold.

1613
02:17:23,444 --> 02:17:26,029
But, oh, no.

1614
02:17:28,949 --> 02:17:32,119
Let's talk about the billionaire
with the lying, dead daddy

1615
02:17:32,202 --> 02:17:35,122
because at least the money
makes it go down easy.

1616
02:17:35,205 --> 02:17:36,405
Doesn't it?

1617
02:17:37,666 --> 02:17:39,710
Bruce...

1618
02:17:40,753 --> 02:17:42,671
Wayne.

1619
02:17:46,341 --> 02:17:49,428
He's the only one we didn't get.

1620
02:17:52,848 --> 02:17:55,976
But we got the rest of 'em, didn't we?

1621
02:17:57,436 --> 02:18:01,315
All those slick, sleazy, phony pricks.

1622
02:18:04,485 --> 02:18:05,685
God.

1623
02:18:06,653 --> 02:18:07,946
Look at you.

1624
02:18:09,615 --> 02:18:12,075
Your mask is amazing.

1625
02:18:12,159 --> 02:18:15,078
I wish you could've seen me in mine.

1626
02:18:15,108 --> 02:18:16,300
Ain't it funny?

1627
02:18:16,330 --> 02:18:20,751
All everyone wants to do is unmask you,
but they're missing the point.

1628
02:18:22,211 --> 02:18:24,254
You and I both know.

1629
02:18:25,214 --> 02:18:27,716
I'm looking at the real you right now.

1630
02:18:27,800 --> 02:18:31,428
My mask allowed me
to be myself completely.

1631
02:18:31,512 --> 02:18:33,055
No shame,

1632
02:18:33,827 --> 02:18:35,027
no limits.

1633
02:18:35,057 --> 02:18:36,725
Why did you write me?

1634
02:18:37,455 --> 02:18:38,655
What do you mean?

1635
02:18:38,685 --> 02:18:40,395
All those cards.

1636
02:18:40,479 --> 02:18:41,688
I told you,

1637
02:18:42,397 --> 02:18:44,316
we've been doing this together.
You're a part of this.

1638
02:18:44,399 --> 02:18:46,610
- We didn't do anything together.
- We did.

1639
02:18:46,693 --> 02:18:48,153
What did we just do?

1640
02:18:48,237 --> 02:18:50,239
I asked you to bring him into the light,
and you did.

1641
02:18:50,322 --> 02:18:51,522
We're such a good team.

1642
02:18:51,552 --> 02:18:52,628
We're not a team.

1643
02:18:52,658 --> 02:18:55,160
I never could have
gotten him out of there.

1644
02:18:55,244 --> 02:18:57,663
I'm not physical.
My strength is up here.

1645
02:18:57,746 --> 02:19:00,916
I mean, I had all the pieces,
I had the answers.

1646
02:19:00,999 --> 02:19:02,626
But I didn't know
how to make them listen.

1647
02:19:02,709 --> 02:19:03,919
You gave me that.

1648
02:19:03,982 --> 02:19:05,182
I gave you nothing.

1649
02:19:05,212 --> 02:19:07,798
You showed me what was possible.

1650
02:19:07,881 --> 02:19:12,761
You showed me all it takes is fear
and a little focused violence.

1651
02:19:12,845 --> 02:19:14,388
You inspired me.

1652
02:19:14,471 --> 02:19:15,973
You're out of your goddamn mind.

1653
02:19:17,037 --> 02:19:18,237
What?

1654
02:19:18,267 --> 02:19:20,435
This is all in your head.
You're sick, twisted.

1655
02:19:20,519 --> 02:19:21,895
How can you say that?

1656
02:19:21,979 --> 02:19:23,480
You think you'll be remembered?

1657
02:19:23,564 --> 02:19:25,232
You're a pathetic psychopath,

1658
02:19:25,732 --> 02:19:27,484
- begging for attention.
- No.

1659
02:19:27,568 --> 02:19:29,236
- You're gonna die alone in Arkham.
- No.

1660
02:19:29,266 --> 02:19:30,415
No, no!

1661
02:19:30,445 --> 02:19:31,645
A nobody!

1662
02:19:33,156 --> 02:19:34,950
No!

1663
02:19:36,869 --> 02:19:39,246
Ahhh!

1664
02:19:39,496 --> 02:19:42,082
This is not how this was supposed to go!

1665
02:19:43,041 --> 02:19:46,670
Ahhh!

1666
02:19:46,753 --> 02:19:49,381
I had it all planned out!

1667
02:19:50,382 --> 02:19:52,384
We were gonna be safe here.

1668
02:19:52,759 --> 02:19:56,054
We could watch the whole thing together.

1669
02:19:56,084 --> 02:19:57,192
Watch what?

1670
02:19:57,222 --> 02:19:58,974
Everything!

1671
02:20:07,316 --> 02:20:08,984
It was all there.

1672
02:20:11,153 --> 02:20:13,488
You mean, you didn't figure it out?

1673
02:20:17,784 --> 02:20:21,705
Oh, you're really not as smart
as I thought you were.

1674
02:20:23,749 --> 02:20:25,834
I guess I gave you too much credit.

1675
02:20:26,293 --> 02:20:27,544
What have you done?

1676
02:20:28,253 --> 02:20:33,133
What's black and blue and dead all over?

1677
02:20:35,969 --> 02:20:37,804
You.

1678
02:20:39,473 --> 02:20:41,600
If you think you can stop
what's coming...

1679
02:20:42,935 --> 02:20:44,478
What have you done?

1680
02:20:46,021 --> 02:20:51,860
Ave Maria

1681
02:20:52,277 --> 02:20:54,154
What have you done?

1682
02:20:56,615 --> 02:20:57,991
Gratia plena

1683
02:20:58,158 --> 02:20:59,576
What have you done?

1684
02:21:03,580 --> 02:21:06,959
Maria

1685
02:21:07,125 --> 02:21:12,673
Gratia plena

1686
02:21:44,538 --> 02:21:45,914
Hey!

1687
02:21:46,915 --> 02:21:48,208
What are you doing in here?

1688
02:22:06,143 --> 02:22:08,729
Hey, man, I don't think that
you should be touching that.

1689
02:22:15,318 --> 02:22:17,779
Boy, this guy's a real nutjob, huh?

1690
02:22:18,655 --> 02:22:21,408
Killing Mitchell
with a friggin' carpet tool.

1691
02:22:26,079 --> 02:22:29,124
My uncle's a... He's an installer.

1692
02:22:29,207 --> 02:22:31,376
You know, it's a... Oh, you know.

1693
02:22:31,460 --> 02:22:33,712
It's a tucker.

1694
02:22:51,521 --> 02:22:52,721
Huh.

1695
02:23:07,704 --> 02:23:10,499
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

1696
02:23:10,582 --> 02:23:12,084
What are you doing?

1697
02:23:42,614 --> 02:23:44,032
Hey, guys.

1698
02:23:44,366 --> 02:23:46,576
Uh, thanks for all the comments

1699
02:23:46,660 --> 02:23:49,621
and a special thanks to everyone
for the tips on detonators.

1700
02:23:49,651 --> 02:23:50,759
Detonators?

1701
02:23:50,789 --> 02:23:55,836
I just want to say this will be my last
post for a little while, and, uh...

1702
02:23:58,088 --> 02:24:00,173
what this community has meant to me

1703
02:24:00,257 --> 02:24:03,260
these weeks, these months,

1704
02:24:04,177 --> 02:24:06,596
let's just say none of us...

1705
02:24:08,306 --> 02:24:10,433
is alone anymore. Okay?

1706
02:24:11,143 --> 02:24:12,343
Jesus.

1707
02:24:16,690 --> 02:24:19,276
Tomorrow's Election Day.

1708
02:24:21,862 --> 02:24:24,489
And Bella Real will win.

1709
02:24:24,573 --> 02:24:27,200
She promised real change.

1710
02:24:27,909 --> 02:24:30,287
But we know the truth, don't we?

1711
02:24:30,370 --> 02:24:32,455
You've seen Gotham's true face now.

1712
02:24:32,539 --> 02:24:34,416
Together, we've unmasked it.

1713
02:24:34,499 --> 02:24:37,460
Its corruption, its perversion

1714
02:24:37,544 --> 02:24:41,381
masquerading under the guise of renewal.

1715
02:24:41,464 --> 02:24:45,302
But unmasking is not enough.

1716
02:24:47,512 --> 02:24:51,516
The day of judgment is finally upon us.

1717
02:24:51,600 --> 02:24:53,977
And now it is time

1718
02:24:55,061 --> 02:24:57,439
for retribution.

1719
02:24:57,522 --> 02:25:00,317
I've parked seven vans

1720
02:25:00,609 --> 02:25:02,944
all along the city seawall.

1721
02:25:04,154 --> 02:25:06,031
And on the big night,

1722
02:25:06,114 --> 02:25:08,366
they will go boom.

1723
02:25:22,631 --> 02:25:23,882
Boom!

1724
02:25:29,137 --> 02:25:30,597
Boom!

1725
02:25:33,266 --> 02:25:35,518
When the vans blow,

1726
02:25:35,602 --> 02:25:41,233
the flooding will happen so fast,
evacuation will not be an option.

1727
02:25:41,566 --> 02:25:44,527
Those who are not washed away

1728
02:25:44,611 --> 02:25:47,614
will race through the streets in terror.

1729
02:25:47,644 --> 02:25:48,835
Call Gordon.

1730
02:25:48,865 --> 02:25:50,992
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1731
02:25:52,577 --> 02:25:54,204
As breaking news

1732
02:25:54,287 --> 02:25:56,206
hits higher ground
in Gotham Square Garden...

1733
02:25:56,331 --> 02:25:59,292
...celebrations will turn to panic,

1734
02:25:59,376 --> 02:26:04,214
as the venue becomes
the city's shelter of last resort.

1735
02:26:05,590 --> 02:26:09,594
And that's where all of you come in.

1736
02:26:16,017 --> 02:26:19,312
Now, when the time arrives,
I will already be unmasked.

1737
02:26:19,396 --> 02:26:21,564
The pigs will have me in their custody,

1738
02:26:21,648 --> 02:26:23,692
but that's okay.

1739
02:26:23,775 --> 02:26:28,280
Because then it will be your turn.

1740
02:26:28,363 --> 02:26:32,242
You'll be there, waiting.

1741
02:26:43,295 --> 02:26:46,214
It's time for the lies to finally end.

1742
02:26:46,298 --> 02:26:50,427
False promises of renewal?

1743
02:26:50,510 --> 02:26:51,710
Change?

1744
02:26:52,012 --> 02:26:55,807
We'll give them real, real change now.

1745
02:26:55,890 --> 02:27:00,895
We've spent our lives in this
wretched place, suffering!

1746
02:27:01,354 --> 02:27:03,857
Wondering, "Why us?"

1747
02:27:03,940 --> 02:27:07,068
Now they will spend
their last moments wondering,

1748
02:27:07,152 --> 02:27:09,321
why them?

1749
02:27:09,404 --> 02:27:11,448
I can't get through! The lines are down.

1750
02:27:17,078 --> 02:27:19,247
Hey, hey, hey! Road's closed!

1751
02:27:19,831 --> 02:27:21,458
I'm just trying to get out of town, man!

1752
02:27:21,541 --> 02:27:24,419
Lady, we got bombs going off.
The whole city's flooding.

1753
02:27:24,502 --> 02:27:26,463
You're gonna have to go inside
the Garden with everyone else.

1754
02:27:36,097 --> 02:27:37,766
- Lieutenant, who's in charge?
- I really don't know.

1755
02:27:37,849 --> 02:27:39,351
We're just trying
to get a handle here, sir.

1756
02:27:39,434 --> 02:27:41,269
Right. Hey, listen! Quiet!

1757
02:27:41,353 --> 02:27:42,604
We got an active situation.

1758
02:27:42,729 --> 02:27:44,022
We need to sweep the building
for explosives

1759
02:27:44,105 --> 02:27:45,315
and get the mayor-elect
out of here, now.

1760
02:27:45,345 --> 02:27:46,369
- Where is she?
- I can take you there.

1761
02:27:46,399 --> 02:27:47,287
Come!

1762
02:28:23,269 --> 02:28:24,687
- If we don't close the doors...
- MCU.

1763
02:28:24,717 --> 02:28:25,700
...we're gonna have huge problems.

1764
02:28:25,730 --> 02:28:27,107
The water's already started to breach.

1765
02:28:27,190 --> 02:28:28,733
I thought this was
a shelter of last resort.

1766
02:28:28,817 --> 02:28:31,027
Yeah, for a hurricane,
but not if the whole seawall comes down.

1767
02:28:31,111 --> 02:28:32,946
am not gonna let
those people die out there.

1768
02:28:33,029 --> 02:28:35,365
All right. I'll go calm down the crowd
SO we can get everyone in.

1769
02:28:35,448 --> 02:28:37,700
It's not safe for you here.
We need to get you out, Ms. Real.

1770
02:28:37,784 --> 02:28:40,036
- I'm not going anywhere.
- We're under attack, ma'am.

1771
02:28:40,120 --> 02:28:41,955
Exactly! That's the problem
with this city.

1772
02:28:42,038 --> 02:28:45,041
Everyone's afraid to stand up
and do the right thing, but I'm not.

1773
02:28:45,125 --> 02:28:46,626
- Excuse me.
- Ma'am...

1774
02:28:51,798 --> 02:28:55,260
Everyone, everyone,
if I could just get your attention.

1775
02:28:55,343 --> 02:28:57,637
Please! I just need your attention!

1776
02:29:13,528 --> 02:29:14,728
You're okay!

1777
02:30:45,578 --> 02:30:48,206
Hey! Hey! How do I get up there?

1778
02:30:48,289 --> 02:30:49,499
Follow me, sir.

1779
02:32:59,504 --> 02:33:01,005
No, no. It's okay.

1780
02:33:01,035 --> 02:33:02,226
It's okay.

1781
02:33:03,299 --> 02:33:04,499
It's okay.

1782
02:33:05,968 --> 02:33:08,096
It's done now. It's done.

1783
02:33:10,807 --> 02:33:12,141
It's over.

1784
02:34:07,989 --> 02:34:11,451
Hey! Hey, man, take it easy!

1785
02:34:12,160 --> 02:34:14,495
Take it easy. Easy.

1786
02:34:43,065 --> 02:34:44,265
Jesus.

1787
02:34:54,035 --> 02:34:55,703
Who the hell are you?

1788
02:34:59,916 --> 02:35:01,116
Me?

1789
02:35:04,086 --> 02:35:05,505
I'm Vengeance.

1790
02:38:37,967 --> 02:38:40,261
Wednesday, November 6th.

1791
02:38:43,472 --> 02:38:45,349
The city is underwater.

1792
02:38:47,685 --> 02:38:49,437
The National Guard is coming.

1793
02:38:51,731 --> 02:38:53,733
Martial law is in effect...

1794
02:38:54,650 --> 02:38:56,277
but the criminal element never sleeps.

1795
02:38:59,488 --> 02:39:03,200
Looting and lawlessness will be rampant

1796
02:39:03,284 --> 02:39:05,828
in the parts of the city
no one can get to.

1797
02:39:06,996 --> 02:39:10,708
I can already see things will get worse
before they get better.

1798
02:39:13,669 --> 02:39:16,797
And some will seize the chance
to grab everything they can.

1799
02:39:18,174 --> 02:39:19,550
We will rebuild.

1800
02:39:20,176 --> 02:39:21,635
But not just our city.

1801
02:39:22,344 --> 02:39:26,557
We must rebuild people's faith
in our institutions,

1802
02:39:26,640 --> 02:39:28,726
in our elected officials,

1803
02:39:28,809 --> 02:39:30,102
in each other.

1804
02:39:30,895 --> 02:39:34,231
Together, we will learn
to believe in Gotham again.

1805
02:39:38,569 --> 02:39:40,237
I'm starting to see now.

1806
02:39:41,697 --> 02:39:43,866
I have had an effect here...

1807
02:39:45,951 --> 02:39:47,870
but not the one I intended.

1808
02:39:50,247 --> 02:39:53,292
Vengeance won't change the past,

1809
02:39:54,627 --> 02:39:57,004
mine or anyone else's.

1810
02:39:59,423 --> 02:40:01,467
I have to become more.

1811
02:40:04,553 --> 02:40:06,180
People need hope.

1812
02:40:07,389 --> 02:40:09,600
To know someone's out there for them.

1813
02:40:13,395 --> 02:40:15,064
The city's angry,

1814
02:40:15,981 --> 02:40:17,358
scarred,

1815
02:40:18,275 --> 02:40:19,527
like me.

1816
02:40:21,654 --> 02:40:23,739
Our scars can destroy us.

1817
02:40:25,116 --> 02:40:27,827
Even after
the physical wounds have healed.

1818
02:40:29,453 --> 02:40:31,205
But if we survive them,

1819
02:40:32,706 --> 02:40:34,583
they can transform us.

1820
02:40:36,460 --> 02:40:38,379
They can give us the power

1821
02:40:39,338 --> 02:40:40,840
lo endure...

1822
02:40:42,216 --> 02:40:44,343
and the strength to fight.

1823
02:40:47,263 --> 02:40:49,431
We are live. As you can see,

1824
02:40:49,515 --> 02:40:52,309
the masked vigilante
atop Gotham Square Garden

1825
02:40:52,393 --> 02:40:53,978
helping to save the lives

1826
02:40:54,061 --> 02:40:55,688
of hundreds of victims.

1827
02:40:55,771 --> 02:40:58,774
And now as first responders desperately
scramble to help the injured,

1828
02:40:58,858 --> 02:41:01,402
a mysterious masked man emerges,

1829
02:41:01,485 --> 02:41:03,821
heroically pulling the victims
right through that skylight...

1830
02:41:03,904 --> 02:41:06,365
Isn't that just terrible?

1831
02:41:07,741 --> 02:41:09,660
Him...

1832
02:41:09,743 --> 02:41:12,621
raining on your parade like that?

1833
02:41:18,335 --> 02:41:20,337
What is it they say?

1834
02:41:21,505 --> 02:41:23,674
"One day you're on top,

1835
02:41:25,217 --> 02:41:26,886
the next...

1836
02:41:28,262 --> 02:41:30,181
you're a clown."

1837
02:41:32,558 --> 02:41:33,758
Well,

1838
02:41:35,519 --> 02:41:38,355
let me tell you,
there are worse things to be.

1839
02:41:40,649 --> 02:41:43,319
Hey, hey, hey. Don't be sad.

1840
02:41:44,612 --> 02:41:46,447
You did so well.

1841
02:41:50,951 --> 02:41:52,151
And you know,

1842
02:41:53,621 --> 02:41:56,832
Gotham loves a comeback story.

1843
02:42:06,884 --> 02:42:08,260
Who are you?

1844
02:42:08,802 --> 02:42:11,222
Well, that's the question,

1845
02:42:12,473 --> 02:42:13,673
isn't it?

1846
02:42:16,560 --> 02:42:18,938
Riddle me this...

1847
02:42:21,398 --> 02:42:23,525
"The less of them you have,

1848
02:42:24,276 --> 02:42:28,113
the more one is worth."

1849
02:42:33,535 --> 02:42:35,287
A friend.

1850
02:43:01,522 --> 02:43:02,722
You're leaving.

1851
02:43:03,440 --> 02:43:04,640
Jesus.

1852
02:43:06,277 --> 02:43:07,861
Don't you ever just say hello?

1853
02:43:12,950 --> 02:43:14,368
Where will you go?

1854
02:43:15,869 --> 02:43:18,289
I don't know. Upstate.

1855
02:43:18,706 --> 02:43:20,416
Bludhaven, maybe.

1856
02:43:21,292 --> 02:43:22,492
Why?

1857
02:43:23,502 --> 02:43:24,712
You asking me to stay?

1858
02:43:31,760 --> 02:43:33,887
You know this place
is never gonna change.

1859
02:43:34,305 --> 02:43:36,640
With Carmine gone,
it's only gonna get worse for you.

1860
02:43:36,724 --> 02:43:38,642
There's gonna be a power grab.

1861
02:43:40,269 --> 02:43:41,469
It'll be bloody.

1862
02:43:42,021 --> 02:43:43,230
I know.

1863
02:43:44,711 --> 02:43:45,911
But the city can change.

1864
02:43:45,941 --> 02:43:47,192
It won't.

1865
02:43:48,173 --> 02:43:49,373
I have to try.

1866
02:43:49,403 --> 02:43:51,196
It's gonna kill you eventually.
You know that.

1867
02:43:53,490 --> 02:43:54,690
Listen.

1868
02:43:57,036 --> 02:43:58,287
Why don't you come with me?

1869
02:43:59,246 --> 02:44:00,748
Get into some trouble.

1870
02:44:01,498 --> 02:44:05,002
Knock off some CEO hedge fund types.
It'll be fun.

1871
02:44:05,669 --> 02:44:07,296
The bat and the cat.

1872
02:44:08,797 --> 02:44:10,466
It's got a nice ring.

1873
02:44:23,812 --> 02:44:25,230
Who am I kidding?

1874
02:44:26,690 --> 02:44:28,817
You're already spoken for.

1875
02:44:40,704 --> 02:44:42,122
You should go.

1876
02:44:50,464 --> 02:44:51,664
Selina...

1877
02:44:55,552 --> 02:44:57,221
Take care of yourself.
