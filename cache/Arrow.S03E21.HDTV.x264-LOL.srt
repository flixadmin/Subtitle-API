1
00:00:00,411 --> 00:00:02,806
My name
was Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:02,807 --> 00:00:04,940
For three years,
I worked to save my city.

3
00:00:04,942 --> 00:00:08,510
But to save my sister,
I had to become someone else.

4
00:00:08,512 --> 00:00:13,048
I had to become
something else.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:15,017
Previously, on "Arrow"...

6
00:00:16,113 --> 00:00:17,433
You can still
save her, Oliver!

7
00:00:17,484 --> 00:00:19,621
Take your rightful place
as heir to the Demon.

8
00:00:19,623 --> 00:00:22,024
Ra's al Ghul will bring
your sister back.

9
00:00:27,145 --> 00:00:29,512
I fulfilled my end
of our arrangement.

10
00:00:29,514 --> 00:00:31,715
I suggest you begin
to make peace with yours.

11
00:00:34,352 --> 00:00:36,286
The only way that
I'm going to survive this

12
00:00:36,288 --> 00:00:37,821
is if I know that
you're out there

13
00:00:37,823 --> 00:00:39,990
living your life, happy.

14
00:00:39,992 --> 00:00:42,225
Oliver Queen
is dead, and for now,

15
00:00:42,227 --> 00:00:45,328
only the Arrow,
Al Sah-him, shall remain.

16
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,163
Heir to the Demon.

17
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:08,985
Oliver Queen
is alive only in the past.

18
00:01:08,987 --> 00:01:11,988
He is forgotten.

19
00:01:17,854 --> 00:01:19,996
Oliver Queen
is alive only in the past.

20
00:01:21,121 --> 00:01:21,831
He is forgotten.

21
00:01:43,788 --> 00:01:47,223
You are Al Sah-him.

22
00:02:12,917 --> 00:02:15,819
You have made great progress
in three weeks.

23
00:02:15,821 --> 00:02:18,355
Al Sah-him.

24
00:02:18,357 --> 00:02:22,292
You no longer flinch
upon hearing your new name.

25
00:02:22,294 --> 00:02:25,261
Oliver Queen is alive
only in the past.

26
00:02:25,263 --> 00:02:28,164
He's forgotten.

27
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:30,633
Indeed. You are Al Sah-him.

28
00:02:30,635 --> 00:02:33,436
You are Wareeth al Ghul.
Heir to the demon.

29
00:02:33,438 --> 00:02:35,038
My lord.

30
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,574
I apologize for this
interruption.

31
00:02:37,576 --> 00:02:39,275
We captured
this intruder.

32
00:02:39,277 --> 00:02:41,244
Why, then, is he
still yet alive?

33
00:02:41,246 --> 00:02:45,148
He is known
to Al Sah-him.

34
00:02:48,285 --> 00:02:51,721
Oliver, what the hell
is going on?

35
00:02:51,723 --> 00:02:54,924
Clearly he made another attempt
to free Al Sah-him.

36
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:58,128
Well, then it falls on Al Sah-him
to deal with him.

37
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,096
Oliver, they're lying to you.

38
00:03:00,098 --> 00:03:02,932
I never made it home.

39
00:03:02,934 --> 00:03:05,068
They've had me here
prisoner for weeks.

40
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,803
My oath of mercy
on your friends

41
00:03:06,805 --> 00:03:08,405
was premised
by your fealty.

42
00:03:08,407 --> 00:03:10,540
Prove it.

43
00:03:10,542 --> 00:03:13,710
No, Oliver.
Listen to me--

44
00:03:13,712 --> 00:03:15,779
they're lying to you.
We could still get out of here;

45
00:03:15,781 --> 00:03:18,848
you and me working together.
There's still a chance.

46
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,651
Remove his chains.

47
00:03:26,512 --> 00:03:27,724
Give him your sword,
Sarab.

48
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:30,460
I will not kill
an unarmed man.

49
00:03:35,295 --> 00:03:36,800
That's the way this is?

50
00:03:36,802 --> 00:03:38,168
You've been here
for a few weeks

51
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,403
and you forget
who you are.

52
00:03:40,405 --> 00:03:42,639
Do you remember when
you brought me into your crusade,

53
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:44,541
I told you that I would
be here to help remind you

54
00:03:44,543 --> 00:03:48,111
who Oliver was, if you ever became
something else.

55
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:51,147
I haven't given up
on that promise.

56
00:03:53,005 --> 00:03:54,483
Fight.

57
00:04:22,953 --> 00:04:24,277
The past three weeks,

58
00:04:24,278 --> 00:04:27,579
you've been exposed
to a rare herb centuries old.

59
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:30,082
It causes one's conscience

60
00:04:30,084 --> 00:04:31,850
to come to the forefront
of their mind

61
00:04:31,852 --> 00:04:33,885
so it is the only
thing that they see.

62
00:04:33,887 --> 00:04:37,456
The herb's effect
is different for everyone.

63
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:42,060
Some people see family
and loved ones.

64
00:04:42,062 --> 00:04:45,897
Others encounter
trusted friends or teachers.

65
00:04:45,899 --> 00:04:49,267
Who did you see?

66
00:04:49,269 --> 00:04:52,104
Very well.

67
00:04:52,106 --> 00:04:54,906
There is something else
I wish you to see. Come.

68
00:04:55,251 --> 00:04:57,943
Where?

69
00:04:57,945 --> 00:04:59,745
The past.

70
00:04:59,747 --> 00:05:03,648
A place now home
only for the dead.

71
00:05:37,017 --> 00:05:39,584
I had the vial
in my hand!

72
00:05:39,586 --> 00:05:41,620
What's happening
is not your fault.

73
00:05:41,622 --> 00:05:43,722
Shrieve is to blame,
this is his doing.

74
00:05:43,724 --> 00:05:45,090
I can't get through.

75
00:05:45,092 --> 00:05:46,858
Everyone's calling the police.

76
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,260
We're all inoculated,
remember?

77
00:05:48,262 --> 00:05:51,863
I want to get back
to my son.

78
00:05:51,865 --> 00:05:53,431
Have not
been back to this place

79
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:55,300
since I pledged myself
to the League.

80
00:05:55,302 --> 00:05:57,068
What
happened here?

81
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:59,337
When I joined the League,
I was conscripted with another man.

82
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:01,206
Damien Darhk.

83
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:04,943
We would become
the prized agents of Ra's al Ghul.

84
00:06:04,945 --> 00:06:08,280
We were his horsemen.
And he molded us into warriors

85
00:06:08,282 --> 00:06:10,182
the likes the world
had never seen.

86
00:06:10,184 --> 00:06:12,017
We were as brothers.

87
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:13,618
What happened
to him?

88
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,721
He believed himself worthy
of becoming heir to the Demon,

89
00:06:16,723 --> 00:06:19,357
but I was the one chosen.

90
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:21,760
So you had
to kill him.

91
00:06:21,762 --> 00:06:23,628
Yes.

92
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:26,998
But you see, I hesitated.
And with that hesitation,

93
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,267
he found an opportunity
to escape,

94
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:33,371
taking with him his loyalists and
water from the Lazarus pit.

95
00:06:33,373 --> 00:06:36,508
And he has vexed me
ever since.

96
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:38,410
And you.

97
00:06:38,412 --> 00:06:40,111
I don't follow.

98
00:06:40,113 --> 00:06:41,980
Damien continues
the League's ways,

99
00:06:41,982 --> 00:06:43,949
but through his own
organization filled

100
00:06:43,951 --> 00:06:46,084
with a hive of agents

101
00:06:46,086 --> 00:06:48,553
devoted to his own agenda.

102
00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:52,724
Last year, he tried to purchase
Malcolm Merlyn's earthquake generator.

103
00:06:52,726 --> 00:06:55,961
He gave Gholem Qadir
safe haven to Markovia.

104
00:06:55,963 --> 00:06:59,764
And he hired Mark Shaw to steal
a secret file from A.R.G.U.S.

105
00:06:59,766 --> 00:07:02,200
This was all
the work of one man?

106
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,071
The list goes on.

107
00:07:06,073 --> 00:07:09,407
Many lives have been lost,
others endangered.

108
00:07:09,409 --> 00:07:12,878
And all because I was slow
to swing a vengeful sword.

109
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,080
And I will not have my heir

110
00:07:15,082 --> 00:07:17,349
haunted by the same mistake.

111
00:07:17,351 --> 00:07:19,751
What is it you
wish me to do?

112
00:07:19,753 --> 00:07:23,288
There is a rival who claims
to be heir to the Demon.

113
00:07:24,165 --> 00:07:26,858
And you must eliminate
this threat from your reign.

114
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:31,228
And you must do so
without mercy.

115
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,320

Did you hear?

118
00:07:54,327 --> 00:07:56,861
Masks aren't wanted
in Starling no more.

119
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,465
Tell that to the woman
you mugged.

120
00:08:16,982 --> 00:08:19,584
You underestimated
your opponent again.

121
00:08:19,586 --> 00:08:21,319
I should have known
he had a knife.

122
00:08:21,321 --> 00:08:22,787
He didn't have a knife.

123
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:24,288
What the hell?

124
00:08:27,292 --> 00:08:29,460
He had two.

125
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,931
Shall we continue
your training?

126
00:08:33,933 --> 00:08:35,566
I'm starving.

127
00:08:35,568 --> 00:08:37,668
There's a diner near here
that serves the best

128
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:39,771
black and white milkshakes
in Starling City.

129
00:08:39,773 --> 00:08:42,907
What is a black
and white milkshake?

130
00:08:44,343 --> 00:08:46,544
I never understood
your country's need

131
00:08:46,546 --> 00:08:48,312
to fry everything.

132
00:08:48,314 --> 00:08:51,482
That's because everything tastes
better that way.

133
00:08:51,484 --> 00:08:53,985
This is more oil than potato.

134
00:08:53,987 --> 00:08:56,254
Dip it in
your milkshake.

135
00:08:56,256 --> 00:08:58,322
I sense you're mocking me.

136
00:08:58,324 --> 00:09:00,558
I'm serious.

137
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,561
Here. Dip it in
your milkshake.

138
00:09:06,231 --> 00:09:08,866
I have to admit...

139
00:09:08,868 --> 00:09:11,002
It's fun seeing you
like this.

140
00:09:11,004 --> 00:09:12,236
Like what?

141
00:09:12,238 --> 00:09:14,238
Like a normal
person.

142
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,508
I am a normal person.

143
00:09:20,046 --> 00:09:22,013
I can't believe
you just said that.

144
00:09:22,015 --> 00:09:23,681
Mmm.

145
00:09:23,683 --> 00:09:26,350
That's actually not bad.

146
00:09:27,308 --> 00:09:30,354
And the student
becomes the teacher.

147
00:09:33,225 --> 00:09:35,393
You have a point.

148
00:09:35,395 --> 00:09:39,063
For me, normal is a world
where only the strong survive.

149
00:09:39,065 --> 00:09:42,500
One without simple pleasures.

150
00:09:43,869 --> 00:09:45,903
Thank you, Laurel.

151
00:09:45,905 --> 00:09:48,439
I was alone and adrift,

152
00:09:48,441 --> 00:09:51,375
and you have
shown me kindness.

153
00:09:52,344 --> 00:09:55,446
I'm only
returning the favor.

154
00:09:55,448 --> 00:09:57,348
Isn't that what
you did for Sara?

155
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,851
There's
little comparison

156
00:09:59,853 --> 00:10:03,988
between my current situation and Sara's
after her time with Oliver on Lian Yu.

157
00:10:06,425 --> 00:10:08,759
What's wrong?

158
00:10:08,761 --> 00:10:11,963
It's about Oliver.

159
00:10:11,965 --> 00:10:14,265
There's something
that I haven't told you.

160
00:10:16,001 --> 00:10:19,070
He's in Nanda Parbat.

161
00:10:19,072 --> 00:10:21,739
I don't understand.

162
00:10:21,741 --> 00:10:25,509
He's accepted your father's offer
to become the next Ra's.

163
00:10:25,511 --> 00:10:28,646
You should have not
kept that from me.

164
00:10:28,648 --> 00:10:30,014
I'm sorry,
it's just--

165
00:10:30,016 --> 00:10:31,716
it's just that
you seemed so happy,

166
00:10:31,718 --> 00:10:34,285
and after what
happened with your father, I...

167
00:10:37,489 --> 00:10:41,158
And here comes the Cat-5 prong
into the Ethernet port!

168
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,060
Even if she knew what that was,

169
00:10:43,062 --> 00:10:45,062
even if I knew what that was,

170
00:10:45,064 --> 00:10:47,765
I think Sara's still a little young
for chicken cacciatore.

171
00:10:47,767 --> 00:10:49,867
Well, my mom used
to feed me nachos from the bar

172
00:10:49,869 --> 00:10:52,069
at the Grand  before I was
off the bottle,

173
00:10:52,071 --> 00:10:53,108
and I turned out normal.

174
00:10:53,109 --> 00:10:54,934
Ish.

175
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,344
John...

176
00:11:00,346 --> 00:11:02,380
What's the house rule?

177
00:11:02,382 --> 00:11:05,983
No Glocks
on the dinner table.

178
00:11:06,752 --> 00:11:08,286
How'd it go
out there tonight?

179
00:11:08,288 --> 00:11:10,154
Your Intel was spot-on.

180
00:11:10,156 --> 00:11:12,123
Caught four Halcones
at the docks

181
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,492
trying to unload
a shipment of M16s.

182
00:11:14,494 --> 00:11:18,462
Well, I'm especially proud that
you didn't get yourself killed.

183
00:11:18,464 --> 00:11:20,831
That was my
favorite part, too.

184
00:11:20,833 --> 00:11:25,102
If you're going to keep
going out into the field,

185
00:11:25,104 --> 00:11:27,338
Do not say
"costume."

186
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,073
Ok.

187
00:11:29,075 --> 00:11:31,375
Identity concealment.

188
00:11:31,377 --> 00:11:33,711
Look, eventually we're going
to have to figure out

189
00:11:33,713 --> 00:11:35,479
a new status quo,
a working one,

190
00:11:35,481 --> 00:11:37,281
now that...

191
00:11:37,283 --> 00:11:39,417
Ollie's gone.

192
00:11:41,853 --> 00:11:44,889
How are you doing?

193
00:11:44,891 --> 00:11:48,459
Having never been
resurrected before,

194
00:11:48,461 --> 00:11:50,528
I don't really have anything
to compare it to.

195
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,029
I mean about Oliver.

196
00:11:52,031 --> 00:11:53,277
Being gone.

197
00:11:53,301 --> 00:11:55,301
I don't know.

198
00:11:55,968 --> 00:11:58,436
Mornings are the worst.

199
00:11:58,438 --> 00:12:02,273
I can't really...
leave the loft,

200
00:12:02,275 --> 00:12:05,409
so it's nice to be able
to come here.

201
00:12:05,411 --> 00:12:08,179
You are always welcome
in our home.

202
00:12:09,982 --> 00:12:13,451
I just miss him.

203
00:12:13,453 --> 00:12:16,053
The fact that he's gone
because of me--

204
00:12:16,055 --> 00:12:18,656
He wouldn't want you
blaming yourself.

205
00:12:20,859 --> 00:12:23,461
In the military,
they have a saying

206
00:12:23,463 --> 00:12:24,795
for a soldier

207
00:12:24,797 --> 00:12:27,164
that makes
the ultimate sacrifice.

208
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,834
Gone...

209
00:12:29,836 --> 00:12:31,435
but never forgotten.

210
00:12:31,437 --> 00:12:33,304
Gone, but never forgotten.

211
00:12:38,778 --> 00:12:41,579
Liling's apartment
is just a few more blocks north.

212
00:12:45,917 --> 00:12:47,618
Wallace said
there wasn't a cure.

213
00:12:50,023 --> 00:12:52,790
It's United States
Army. Shrieve's men.

214
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:54,158
That's not a cure
they're giving those people!

215
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,394
It's the virus!

216
00:12:56,396 --> 00:12:58,629
Shrieve is leaving
nothing to chance.

217
00:12:58,631 --> 00:13:00,564
He wants to infect
as many people as possible.

218
00:13:00,566 --> 00:13:01,932
Come on, we have
to stop him.

219
00:13:01,934 --> 00:13:04,435
Hey! Get away from there!

220
00:13:16,214 --> 00:13:17,648
Tatsu, the truck!

221
00:13:34,843 --> 00:13:36,666
I had him!

222
00:13:36,669 --> 00:13:38,702
What do we now?

223
00:13:38,704 --> 00:13:41,605
Destroy it.
All of it.

224
00:13:46,011 --> 00:13:49,180
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about Oliver earlier.

225
00:13:49,182 --> 00:13:50,748
That was your right to know.

226
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:52,316
I just--

227
00:13:52,318 --> 00:13:54,351
things were going
so well for you.

228
00:13:54,353 --> 00:13:56,587
You seemed happy,
and I didn't want to upset you,

229
00:13:56,589 --> 00:13:59,957
but I still shouldn't
have kept it from you.

230
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:03,027
Were I so inclined,
I'd question why your first instinct

231
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:05,596
is to always keep
matters secret.

232
00:14:05,598 --> 00:14:09,133
Even after doing so
cost you a relationship with your father.

233
00:14:09,135 --> 00:14:12,336
But I have much
greater concerns.

234
00:14:12,338 --> 00:14:13,904
What's going on?

235
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,775
You should go.

236
00:14:17,777 --> 00:14:19,710
No.

237
00:14:19,712 --> 00:14:21,745
I'm not leaving.

238
00:14:21,747 --> 00:14:24,682
Friends don't do that
to one another.

239
00:14:24,684 --> 00:14:27,485
Now that Oliver
has ascended to his position

240
00:14:27,487 --> 00:14:31,455
as heir to the Demon,
he will come for me,

241
00:14:31,457 --> 00:14:35,259
with as many men
as it takes to see me dead.

242
00:14:39,164 --> 00:14:41,932
Tonight,
Nyssa al Ghul

243
00:14:41,934 --> 00:14:44,935
faces justice
for her betrayal.

244
00:14:50,678 --> 00:14:52,712
Wait a second!
Oliver wouldn't.

245
00:14:52,714 --> 00:14:54,147
I don't see how.

246
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:55,982
I think what
she's trying to say

247
00:14:55,984 --> 00:14:57,684
is that Oliver would never do anything
to hurt you, Felicity.

248
00:14:57,687 --> 00:14:59,420
And the only reason why
he joined the League

249
00:14:59,421 --> 00:15:00,987
is to protect
the people he loves.

250
00:15:00,989 --> 00:15:02,455
Now what you need
to understand

251
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,358
is that Oliver Queen
is dead.

252
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:05,758
He's a memory.

253
00:15:05,761 --> 00:15:07,828
Apparently, the League
has some of their recruits

254
00:15:07,829 --> 00:15:09,829
undergo a process
of reprogramming.

255
00:15:09,831 --> 00:15:11,564
Like brainwashing?

256
00:15:11,566 --> 00:15:13,933
Oliver never said that he was
signing on for brainwashing.

257
00:15:13,936 --> 00:15:16,704
The League's ways are shrouded
in ritual and ceremony.

258
00:15:16,705 --> 00:15:18,271
Oliver would not even know
what's happening to him.

259
00:15:18,273 --> 00:15:21,474
I don't care!
Oliver, he is stronger than that!

260
00:15:21,476 --> 00:15:23,009
I did not come here to debate.

261
00:15:23,011 --> 00:15:26,012
Laurel insisted that I bring
this news to you myself,

262
00:15:26,014 --> 00:15:29,282
but I can see all I'm doing
is damaging your memory of him.

263
00:15:29,284 --> 00:15:33,252
Perhaps it is better for you to not think
of what Oliver has become.

264
00:15:33,254 --> 00:15:35,688
You can have that luxury.

265
00:15:37,157 --> 00:15:39,092
Wait, where
are you going?

266
00:15:39,094 --> 00:15:42,095
To face him,
and if necessary, my destiny.

267
00:15:42,097 --> 00:15:45,598
I will not cower in the shadows
waiting for death.

268
00:15:49,636 --> 00:15:52,839
Great. Now what
are we supposed to do?

269
00:15:52,841 --> 00:15:55,308
Nothing. No offense,
but Nyssa is insane.

270
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:57,577
Oliver
is still Oliver.

271
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,280
Nobody knows the League
better than Nyssa.

272
00:16:00,281 --> 00:16:02,248
And did you see the look on her face?
She was terrified.

273
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,050
I didn't even think
that was possible.

274
00:16:04,052 --> 00:16:06,085
Even if Nyssa's
right about Oliver...

275
00:16:06,087 --> 00:16:07,720
Which she isn't.

276
00:16:07,723 --> 00:16:09,189
Getting between her
and the League isn't an option.

277
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,723
And since when
does Ra's daughter

278
00:16:10,725 --> 00:16:13,059
become someone we stick
our necks out for, Laurel?

279
00:16:13,061 --> 00:16:14,927
I know you're furious with Ra's
for what he's done to Oliver.

280
00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:16,596
We all are.

281
00:16:16,598 --> 00:16:20,333
But Nyssa, she saved
my sister's life.

282
00:16:20,335 --> 00:16:22,769
She gave her a home.

283
00:16:22,771 --> 00:16:25,171
She's a good person.

284
00:16:25,173 --> 00:16:27,807
In spite of everything that
she grew up with.

285
00:16:27,809 --> 00:16:29,842
And the last time
I checked,

286
00:16:29,844 --> 00:16:32,612
protecting good people,
that is what we do.

287
00:16:32,614 --> 00:16:34,814
Fine.

288
00:16:34,817 --> 00:16:37,684
Nyssa does seem to have an idea
where we can find Oliver and the League.

289
00:16:37,685 --> 00:16:40,286
Well, then I guess we shouldn't have
let Nyssa leave alone.

290
00:16:40,288 --> 00:16:41,654
No, it's fine.
I just put

291
00:16:41,656 --> 00:16:44,323
a tracking device
on her.

292
00:16:44,325 --> 00:16:46,192
This isn't
my first day.

293
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,706
Everybody, get back!

294
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:55,730
Away from the truck!

295
00:17:03,744 --> 00:17:06,245
No more virus.

296
00:17:06,247 --> 00:17:08,314
We have to get back to Akio.

297
00:17:08,316 --> 00:17:10,616
Come on.

298
00:17:13,487 --> 00:17:15,288
Anything?

299
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:17,290
Nyssa
hasn't stopped moving.

300
00:17:17,292 --> 00:17:18,724
But I'm still getting
a strong signal off the tracker.

301
00:17:18,726 --> 00:17:22,128
Copy that.
Radio check every five minutes.

302
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,730
What?

303
00:17:24,732 --> 00:17:25,965
If anything happens
with Nyssa,

304
00:17:25,967 --> 00:17:27,600
let me handle it on my own.

305
00:17:27,603 --> 00:17:30,437
Laurel, we're talking
about the League of Assassins!

306
00:17:30,438 --> 00:17:32,438
I know that, I just--

307
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,274
Oliver. You were closer to him
than any two people I've ever known.

308
00:17:35,276 --> 00:17:36,513
You should not have to--

309
00:17:36,537 --> 00:17:37,778
What, fight him?

310
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:40,246
Kill him?

311
00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:44,128
Laurel, it's not going
to come to that.

312
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:45,895
Look, I'm with Felicity.

313
00:17:45,897 --> 00:17:48,131
There's nothing that
Ra's al Ghul can do

314
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:51,234
that can turn Oliver against
the people he loves.

315
00:18:05,216 --> 00:18:07,450
Nice secret
headquarter upgrade.

316
00:18:07,452 --> 00:18:09,418
Does Mr. Palmer know
you guys are in here?

317
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,254
Yes. He's
out of town.

318
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,356
And how did you
get in here?

319
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:14,590
My dad's a super villain

320
00:18:14,592 --> 00:18:16,792
and you left
your doors unlocked.

321
00:18:16,794 --> 00:18:18,694
Right.

322
00:18:19,283 --> 00:18:21,397
I have been
distracted.

323
00:18:21,399 --> 00:18:26,369
'Cause you and Mr. Diggle are trying
to save the city by yourselves?

324
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,404
Look, I've been thinking.

325
00:18:28,406 --> 00:18:31,707
Um, maybe, rather than me
sitting at home,

326
00:18:31,709 --> 00:18:35,077
alone, miserable,
maybe I could...

327
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:37,246
be out there helping you guys.

328
00:18:37,248 --> 00:18:39,415
You seem like
you're shorthanded one,

329
00:18:39,417 --> 00:18:41,984
and vigilante skills
run in my blood.

330
00:18:41,986 --> 00:18:43,719
Thea, this might
actually

331
00:18:43,721 --> 00:18:46,489
be the worst week ever
for this conversation.

332
00:18:46,491 --> 00:18:48,391
What's going on?

333
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:50,493
I--I can't.

334
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:53,930
Felicity, I cannot be
handled right now.

335
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:58,768
It's possible--
and I stress possible--

336
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,836
that Oliver
is back in town

337
00:19:00,838 --> 00:19:02,638
with the League.

338
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,241
I don't understand.

339
00:19:05,243 --> 00:19:07,610
Why would Ollie
come back here?

340
00:19:07,612 --> 00:19:09,745
They're after Nyssa.

341
00:19:09,747 --> 00:19:12,215
Ollie would never--
Nyssa thinks

342
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:15,451
he's under some
sort of League mind voodoo.

343
00:19:17,688 --> 00:19:19,655
But it's going
to be fine.

344
00:19:19,657 --> 00:19:22,592
We're handling it.

345
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:24,694
You are a terrible liar.

346
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,762
That is true.

347
00:19:26,764 --> 00:19:28,364
Do you know
where he is?

348
00:19:28,366 --> 00:19:29,966
I mean, maybe
I could just talk to him.

349
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:31,867
Thea, I don't know
what doctor's orders are

350
00:19:31,869 --> 00:19:33,836
for when someone gets
brought back from the dead,

351
00:19:33,838 --> 00:19:36,072
but I am pretty sure getting into a fight
with the League of Assassins

352
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:37,340
goes against them.

353
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,709
I can get through
to him.

354
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:43,045
Please, Thea.

355
00:19:43,047 --> 00:19:45,448
Oliver wouldn't want you
involved. He did what he did

356
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,917
so that you would stay
out of harm's way.

357
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,552
Yeah, well.

358
00:19:49,554 --> 00:19:51,887
It sounds like
Ollie's not here anymore.

359
00:20:05,535 --> 00:20:09,605
This is where my beloved spirit
departed this world.

360
00:20:09,607 --> 00:20:12,875
Do you even remember Sara?

361
00:20:12,877 --> 00:20:16,612
Or has my father already obliterated her
from your memory?

362
00:20:16,614 --> 00:20:19,915
I'm here to bring you back
to Nanda Parbat.

363
00:20:22,608 --> 00:20:23,786
To face justice?

364
00:20:23,788 --> 00:20:26,622
If so, for what crime?

365
00:20:26,624 --> 00:20:29,258
To face vengeance?

366
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,160
If so, for what offense?

367
00:20:31,162 --> 00:20:33,129
You told me...

368
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:36,032
Vengeance
is justice.

369
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:37,733
And you bested me in battle.

370
00:20:37,735 --> 00:20:40,303
That won't happen again.

371
00:21:06,953 --> 00:21:09,132
Do it! If I would die,
I would have it on

372
00:21:09,156 --> 00:21:11,156
the same ground as Sara.

373
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:23,179
Oh, my God.

374
00:21:23,181 --> 00:21:25,348
We can't let you
hurt her, man.

375
00:21:38,762 --> 00:21:41,063
Oliver!

376
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:48,574
You should not
have interfered.

377
00:21:48,576 --> 00:21:50,275
Look, I am sorry,

378
00:21:50,277 --> 00:21:53,645
but I have lost a sister,
a father, Oliver--

379
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:55,848
there is no way that
I was about to lose you, too.

380
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:57,316
You don't
understand.

381
00:21:57,318 --> 00:21:59,551
You already have.

382
00:21:59,553 --> 00:22:01,086
I was marked for
death the moment

383
00:22:01,088 --> 00:22:03,455
Oliver accepted
my father's offer.

384
00:22:07,228 --> 00:22:09,761
Laurel, these
past few weeks,

385
00:22:09,763 --> 00:22:12,397
they've enlightened me.

386
00:22:12,399 --> 00:22:15,000
To live a life outside of my
father's rule;

387
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:17,102
to be someone else,
even for just a little while,

388
00:22:17,104 --> 00:22:18,937
brought me
great happiness.

389
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,975
But I am daughter
of the Demon.

390
00:22:24,611 --> 00:22:28,313
Happiness is not something that was
ever meant for me.

391
00:22:29,988 --> 00:22:32,118
I've known Oliver
my entire life.

392
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:35,320
We've been friends
since childhood.

393
00:22:35,322 --> 00:22:37,789
But tonight,
I did not recognize him.

394
00:22:37,791 --> 00:22:41,693
I told you...
He has been changed.

395
00:22:41,695 --> 00:22:45,364
Well, if he can change,
then why can't you?

396
00:22:49,435 --> 00:22:52,271
How's Nyssa?

397
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,075
She's with Laurel.
She's going to be ok.

398
00:22:57,151 --> 00:22:59,285
How are you?

399
00:22:59,288 --> 00:23:02,756
Same as you,
probably.

400
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:04,391
Neither one of us
believed Nyssa

401
00:23:04,393 --> 00:23:07,561
when she said Oliver
had been turned.

402
00:23:07,563 --> 00:23:10,931
I'm still not sure
I believe it.

403
00:23:12,233 --> 00:23:16,470
I heard about
this kind of thing.

404
00:23:16,472 --> 00:23:19,840
Guy gets captured
by the enemy.

405
00:23:19,842 --> 00:23:22,009
Gets broken.

406
00:23:22,011 --> 00:23:24,778
I just never imagined Oliver--

407
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,748
still can't imagine--
that Oliver would.

408
00:23:29,751 --> 00:23:32,686
Strongest man I've ever
known, Felicity.

409
00:23:32,688 --> 00:23:34,888
When Oliver stayed behind when
he agreed to join the League,

410
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:38,625
he never could have known that
this is what he was agreeing to.

411
00:23:38,627 --> 00:23:39,993
The only way
that I've been able

412
00:23:39,995 --> 00:23:41,628
to get out of bed
these past few weeks

413
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,031
is because I knew that
Oliver was still alive.

414
00:23:44,033 --> 00:23:45,832
He is alive, Felicity.

415
00:23:45,834 --> 00:23:47,467
We thought

416
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:52,139
that Oliver was
just giving up his life to Ra's.

417
00:23:52,141 --> 00:23:55,375
But he gave up his soul.

418
00:24:02,665 --> 00:24:05,385
There was doubt
you would return.

419
00:24:05,387 --> 00:24:07,387
But not from me.

420
00:24:07,389 --> 00:24:08,756
What happened?

421
00:24:08,757 --> 00:24:10,957
Nyssa had friends.

422
00:24:10,959 --> 00:24:13,660
I warned you not
to face her alone.

423
00:24:13,662 --> 00:24:15,595
These friends
of Nyssa's--

424
00:24:15,597 --> 00:24:18,365
were they
friends of yours?

425
00:24:18,367 --> 00:24:22,769
They'll be protecting her now.

426
00:24:22,771 --> 00:24:24,604
We need to draw her out.

427
00:24:28,844 --> 00:24:30,377
Thank you for coming.

428
00:24:30,379 --> 00:24:33,013
Suffice it to say, I was surprised
to get your call.

429
00:24:33,015 --> 00:24:35,949
I need your help.

430
00:24:35,951 --> 00:24:38,451
That couldn't have been easy
for you to say.

431
00:24:38,453 --> 00:24:42,122
I need to know--
is Ollie back in town?

432
00:24:42,124 --> 00:24:45,458
Is he going after Nyssa?

433
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,294
According
to my sources,

434
00:24:47,296 --> 00:24:48,662
he intends
to eliminate her

435
00:24:48,664 --> 00:24:51,364
as a threat to his
ascension to Ra's.

436
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:52,766
Well, I need to stop him.

437
00:24:52,768 --> 00:24:55,635
His is Wareeth
al Ghul now, Thea.

438
00:24:55,637 --> 00:24:57,370
Heir to the Demon.

439
00:24:57,372 --> 00:24:59,506
He is my brother.

440
00:24:59,509 --> 00:25:02,176
It's one thing to let him join the League
and run off to Nanda Parbat, but--

441
00:25:02,177 --> 00:25:05,145
Another
to let him kill?

442
00:25:05,147 --> 00:25:07,113
What did you think
he would be doing

443
00:25:07,116 --> 00:25:09,250
in the League
of Assassins?

444
00:25:09,251 --> 00:25:13,887
Felicity told me
that he's been brainwashed.

445
00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:16,756
I know what it's like
to kill while under the influence

446
00:25:16,758 --> 00:25:19,192
of someone else.

447
00:25:19,194 --> 00:25:21,661
Your brother didn't sacrifice
everything for you

448
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,864
to go to war
with the League.

449
00:25:23,865 --> 00:25:26,199
That's what Felicity said.

450
00:25:26,201 --> 00:25:28,201
And she was right.

451
00:25:28,203 --> 00:25:29,703
No.

452
00:25:29,705 --> 00:25:32,072
I couldn't stop him
from trading his life

453
00:25:32,074 --> 00:25:33,406
to save mine,

454
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:36,643
but this, this I can stop.

455
00:25:36,645 --> 00:25:38,812
You are
a warrior, Thea.

456
00:25:38,814 --> 00:25:41,348
Long before
I trained you.

457
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:44,217
You have always had an incredible
strength inside you,

458
00:25:44,219 --> 00:25:47,754
and your brother
knows that, too.

459
00:25:47,756 --> 00:25:50,523
Now...

460
00:25:50,525 --> 00:25:53,026
What do you
need from me?

461
00:25:59,078 --> 00:26:01,079
Are you sure this is ok?

462
00:26:01,081 --> 00:26:03,247
Yeah. With Oliver
and the League running around,

463
00:26:03,249 --> 00:26:06,617
it's best we stay
close. Especially if something...

464
00:26:07,653 --> 00:26:10,121
John?

465
00:26:10,123 --> 00:26:12,090
Something's wrong. Lyla?

466
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,462
Where's Lyla?

467
00:26:24,436 --> 00:26:26,404
John.
Oliver?

468
00:26:26,406 --> 00:26:29,207
First, let me assure you that
no harm will come to Lyla,

469
00:26:29,209 --> 00:26:31,943
if you do exactly as I say.

470
00:26:31,945 --> 00:26:35,546
Bring Nyssa to the warehouse
at Fullerton and Halstead,

471
00:26:35,548 --> 00:26:37,448
and I'll let your wife go.

472
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,851
Oliver, I swear, if you
do anything to Lyla...

473
00:26:39,853 --> 00:26:42,854
You have 30 minutes.

474
00:26:54,777 --> 00:26:56,478
Laurel!

475
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,779
What happened?

476
00:26:57,781 --> 00:26:59,381
Oliver and his new
friends took Lyla.

477
00:26:59,383 --> 00:27:00,915
What?! Where's Sara,
is she ok?

478
00:27:00,917 --> 00:27:02,016
Yeah, she's with
John's neighbor.

479
00:27:02,018 --> 00:27:03,685
What's wrong with you?!

480
00:27:03,687 --> 00:27:05,286
Hey, it is not
Nyssa's fault!

481
00:27:05,288 --> 00:27:06,955
No, just her people.

482
00:27:06,957 --> 00:27:08,556
You call yourself
warriors.

483
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:10,358
You claim to have honor.

484
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,893
Well, if you knew
the meaning of the word,

485
00:27:11,895 --> 00:27:13,795
you would know
there are some lines you do not cross!

486
00:27:13,797 --> 00:27:14,652
Ok, John, back off.

487
00:27:14,676 --> 00:27:16,003
You back off!

488
00:27:16,004 --> 00:27:17,866
I am truly sorry.

489
00:27:17,868 --> 00:27:20,368
I never meant for any harm
to come to you or your family.

490
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:21,803
Yeah, Nyssa?

491
00:27:21,805 --> 00:27:24,105
Then prove it.

492
00:27:25,318 --> 00:27:26,641
Hand yourself over
to the League.

493
00:27:26,643 --> 00:27:28,143
What?!

494
00:27:28,145 --> 00:27:30,245
We're just going to
negotiate with him now?

495
00:27:30,247 --> 00:27:32,881
Are we just going to give in?
 Turn over an innocent person?

496
00:27:32,883 --> 00:27:34,849
She's not innocent!

497
00:27:34,852 --> 00:27:36,719
She's the daughter
of the Demon.

498
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,219
She's killed
hundreds of people.

499
00:27:38,221 --> 00:27:39,788
Enough!

500
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:42,390
The only thing that matters is
getting Lyla back.

501
00:27:42,392 --> 00:27:43,756
I don't care how we do it.

502
00:27:43,781 --> 00:27:44,794
Yes, you do.

503
00:27:44,795 --> 00:27:46,428
Trading one person's
life for another--

504
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,829
we're supposed to be
better than that.

505
00:27:47,831 --> 00:27:49,697
It's all right.
Of course you should

506
00:27:49,699 --> 00:27:52,634
exchange me for your beloved.

507
00:27:52,636 --> 00:27:55,537
I won't see an innocent life
taken for mine.

508
00:27:55,539 --> 00:27:57,238
No.

509
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,340
I'm not going to let you
commit suicide.

510
00:27:59,342 --> 00:28:00,975
Don't you remember
what you said?

511
00:28:00,977 --> 00:28:04,112
These past few weeks have been
some of the best of your life.

512
00:28:04,114 --> 00:28:05,980
I remember.

513
00:28:05,982 --> 00:28:09,584
And I remember telling you that
happiness is something denied to me.

514
00:28:09,586 --> 00:28:12,487
Where's the exchange
take place?

515
00:28:12,489 --> 00:28:15,290
No. There has
to be another way.

516
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:18,461
Another way to save Lyla without
turning Nyssa over to the League.

517
00:28:18,462 --> 00:28:22,230
And if there isn't, even if you get Lyla
back safe and sound,

518
00:28:22,232 --> 00:28:25,900
Oliver won't be
the only one who lost his soul.

519
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,872
What happened
to you?

520
00:28:29,873 --> 00:28:33,542
Johnny told me,
but how could you become this?

521
00:28:33,543 --> 00:28:34,608
Quiet.

522
00:28:34,610 --> 00:28:36,177
It'll be over soon.

523
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:39,480
No. I genuinely
want to know.

524
00:28:39,482 --> 00:28:42,616
How could the man who stood up
at my wedding do this?

525
00:28:42,618 --> 00:28:45,119
How could the man who's
been like a brother to--

526
00:28:45,121 --> 00:28:46,821
Quiet!

527
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,724
You know...

528
00:28:49,726 --> 00:28:52,259
When John's brother died,

529
00:28:52,261 --> 00:28:54,562
a part of him died, too.

530
00:28:54,564 --> 00:28:56,330
His guilt and the emptiness

531
00:28:56,332 --> 00:28:58,733
from the loss
outweighed everything.

532
00:28:58,735 --> 00:29:01,502
I tried my hardest
to help him,

533
00:29:01,504 --> 00:29:05,206
but no one seemed to be
able to comfort him or fill that void.

534
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:07,541
Until he met you.

535
00:29:07,543 --> 00:29:11,145
You gave him hope
and purpose again.

536
00:29:11,147 --> 00:29:13,848
It's time.

537
00:29:16,418 --> 00:29:18,386
Akio!

538
00:29:25,727 --> 00:29:27,795
Mother!

539
00:29:27,797 --> 00:29:29,397
Akio!
Akio!

540
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:31,165
Liling's sick.

541
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:32,233
It's going
to be ok.

542
00:29:32,235 --> 00:29:34,235
Akio. Hao Ba.

543
00:29:34,237 --> 00:29:35,970
We have to leave Hong Kong.

544
00:29:35,972 --> 00:29:37,471
Shrieve
and his men--

545
00:29:37,473 --> 00:29:38,939
Have enough to worry about!

546
00:29:38,941 --> 00:29:40,107
Tatsu's right.

547
00:29:40,109 --> 00:29:41,675
The chaos
will give us cover.

548
00:29:41,677 --> 00:29:44,311
Could be our only chance.

549
00:29:49,051 --> 00:29:51,886
They're here.

550
00:29:57,592 --> 00:30:00,094
Search them.

551
00:30:02,631 --> 00:30:04,732
Where's my wife?

552
00:30:04,734 --> 00:30:06,700
Where's my wife?!

553
00:30:10,639 --> 00:30:12,673
You son of a bitch.

554
00:30:12,675 --> 00:30:15,576
Whatever Ra's
did to you...

555
00:30:15,578 --> 00:30:17,912
Don't you dare touch me.

556
00:30:22,484 --> 00:30:24,785
Oliver, this isn't you.

557
00:30:24,787 --> 00:30:27,521
Look at me.

558
00:30:27,523 --> 00:30:30,157
I know you're still
in there somewhere.

559
00:30:33,895 --> 00:30:36,363
Bind her.

560
00:30:46,908 --> 00:30:50,177
You're free to go.

561
00:30:51,146 --> 00:30:52,947
Johnny!

562
00:30:52,949 --> 00:30:54,014
It's ok, I'm here.

563
00:30:54,016 --> 00:30:55,749
I thought they were
going for Sara.

564
00:30:55,751 --> 00:30:57,451
Everything's fine,
Sara's fine.

565
00:30:57,453 --> 00:31:01,155
I told Felicity
this is just like Jakarta.

566
00:31:04,994 --> 00:31:08,430
Kneel before the true
heir to the Demon.

567
00:31:08,431 --> 00:31:10,865
I kneel before no one.

568
00:31:43,431 --> 00:31:45,266
Laurel!

569
00:31:48,803 --> 00:31:50,237
Nyssa!

570
00:31:55,411 --> 00:31:57,745
Aaah!

571
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,955
You're still Oliver.

572
00:32:07,957 --> 00:32:11,358
I don't care
if the hood is black or green.

573
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,461
You're still you!

574
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:19,967
Get away from him.

575
00:32:21,836 --> 00:32:25,773
Get away from him,
or the next one goes in your eye.

576
00:32:51,025 --> 00:32:52,100
Lyla's got Sara.

577
00:32:52,101 --> 00:32:53,935
They're headed out of town until
we can get things straightened out.

578
00:32:53,937 --> 00:32:55,903
There is no straightening
this out.

579
00:32:55,905 --> 00:32:58,973
I don't know, Felicity.
I can't see past tomorrow right now.

580
00:32:58,975 --> 00:33:01,475
They're going
to kill Nyssa.

581
00:33:01,477 --> 00:33:04,378
Oliver or her father,
they're going to kill her.

582
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,414
I'm sorry, Laurel.

583
00:33:06,416 --> 00:33:09,283
It's not fair.

584
00:33:09,285 --> 00:33:10,818
No. No, it's not.

585
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:13,621
I'll ask it to ask it--

586
00:33:15,457 --> 00:33:18,459
there is no way
I'm getting him back.

587
00:33:18,461 --> 00:33:20,628
He's gone,
Felicity.

588
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:23,998
No one wants
to believe that less than me.

589
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,267
But he's gone.

590
00:33:29,271 --> 00:33:32,240
There's only one thing
left of him now.

591
00:33:32,242 --> 00:33:33,941
And what's that?

592
00:33:38,313 --> 00:33:41,048
Us.

593
00:33:42,684 --> 00:33:45,486
Gone, but never forgotten.

594
00:33:55,466 --> 00:33:58,301
There are no more
threats to my reign.

595
00:33:58,303 --> 00:34:01,838
Your fealty continues
to impress me, Al Sah-him.

596
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,108
You truly are
Wareeth al Ghul.

597
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:10,447
And yet my daughter
still does not approve of my choice.

598
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:15,051
Fortunately, what I require from you
is not your approval.

599
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,187
Did you search her?

600
00:34:17,189 --> 00:34:20,490
It does not appear
to be on her person.

601
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:26,096
Bring me her weapons.

602
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:31,935
You know, as a young child,

603
00:34:31,937 --> 00:34:35,505
Nyssa displayed
the panache of a thief.

604
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:37,640
Always stealing
extra atayef at her meals

605
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:40,410
and then stowing them away
in her quarters.

606
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:43,279
She would grow to learn

607
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:45,982
that there is nothing
she can hide from me.

608
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:48,818
Her exploits of late...

609
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:56,326
seem to have
clouded that memory.

610
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:05,735
I will remember you
as the warrior you once were

611
00:35:05,737 --> 00:35:09,572
and not as this shell
that stands before me.

612
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:12,876
All my life, I've lived
in fear of you.

613
00:35:12,878 --> 00:35:16,579
But now, as I stand before
you ready to leave this earth,

614
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:19,015
I want you to know--

615
00:35:19,017 --> 00:35:21,518
I am not afraid.

616
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:26,956
Do what needs to be
done, my heir.

617
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,858
And take with it
the satisfaction

618
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:31,327
that your reign
will be unchallenged.

619
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,812
I can see now,
you do not require

620
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:50,547
a culling to solidify
your reign.

621
00:35:50,549 --> 00:35:53,516
You have broken
your rival, Al Sah-him.

622
00:35:53,518 --> 00:35:56,553
Something I was
unable to do as an heir.

623
00:35:56,555 --> 00:36:00,056
Spilling her blood now
would only serve as gluttony.

624
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:05,829
Now, perhaps...

625
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:08,364
her blood could be
of another purpose.

626
00:36:12,436 --> 00:36:14,804
As a means to unite
our families.

627
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:18,775
You as husband...

628
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:20,910
and you as wife.

629
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:23,446
I would rather die than
become his betrothed.

630
00:36:23,448 --> 00:36:25,348
Well, your wishes
were no longer my concern

631
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,751
from the moment
you betrayed me.

632
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:32,789
So you will marry Al Sah-him.

633
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:36,292
And you will become
bride of the Demon.

634
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:53,309
Come on,
come on, come on!

635
00:36:56,114 --> 00:36:58,615
We need a vehicle.

636
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:02,819
Oliver!

637
00:37:10,495 --> 00:37:12,128
Let's get out of this place.

638
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:15,031
It's ok.
You're safe now.

639
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:28,912
Thea?

640
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:32,415
The door was open.

641
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:35,919
Sorry to interrupt
your staring into nothingness.

642
00:37:37,087 --> 00:37:39,656
He should have let me die.

643
00:37:39,658 --> 00:37:42,625
That was never
an option.

644
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:48,531
That's why
I love him.

645
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:51,034
I didn't know...

646
00:37:51,036 --> 00:37:54,037
about you and my brother.

647
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:57,707
Yeah, well...

648
00:37:57,709 --> 00:38:01,678
It was complicated.

649
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,781
But I did love him.

650
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:08,851
Despite everything,
I still do.

651
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:13,356
I do, too.

652
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:15,525
How...

653
00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:17,894
is that even possible?

654
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:21,764
After what he's become.

655
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:26,502
I don't know.

656
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:28,304
But I think John's right;
I think we have

657
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,206
to remember
the best parts of him,

658
00:38:30,208 --> 00:38:33,042
and we have
to move on.

659
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:35,144
Are you trying
to convince me

660
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,879
or yourself?

661
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:39,816
Both of us.

662
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:44,053
I don't know how,
but we have to go on living.

663
00:38:44,055 --> 00:38:46,522
That's what
Oliver...

664
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:49,258
Ollie would want
for you--

665
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,727
to move on.

666
00:38:50,729 --> 00:38:52,628
To live.

667
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:55,932
To be with the one that you love
while you still can.

668
00:38:55,934 --> 00:38:59,035
Roy is gone, so...

669
00:38:59,037 --> 00:39:01,904
You've had a lot
on your plate,

670
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:05,375
and I've been trying to think
of the right time

671
00:39:05,377 --> 00:39:07,643
to tell you this...

672
00:39:07,645 --> 00:39:11,247
Roy's alive.

673
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:13,049
We faked his death.

674
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:16,052
It's a long story,
as most fake death stories are.

675
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:17,653
We were going to
tell you, I promise.

676
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:19,322
But then you were busy
being mostly dead,

677
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:20,867
and then Oliver
signed on to become Darth Oliver.

678
00:39:20,868 --> 00:39:21,789
I don't--

679
00:39:21,813 --> 00:39:23,813
He's starting...

680
00:39:24,562 --> 00:39:27,096
A new life.

681
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:30,733
One that hopefully
includes you.

682
00:39:33,771 --> 00:39:35,738
If you want it.

683
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:20,550
When my daughter
left Nanda Parbat,

684
00:40:20,552 --> 00:40:23,019
she absconded something critical
to both our futures.

685
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:24,754
Do you recall
the village I showed you?

686
00:40:24,756 --> 00:40:27,290
The one where only
the dead remain?

687
00:40:27,292 --> 00:40:28,018
It was your home.

688
00:40:28,042 --> 00:40:29,493
Was.

689
00:40:29,494 --> 00:40:32,061
And I was obligated to
unleash death upon it.

690
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:35,664
It has been this way
ever since there has been a Ra's.

691
00:40:35,667 --> 00:40:38,000
You see, it is
the final act of ascension,

692
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:40,503
the transformation
to Demon's Head.

693
00:40:40,505 --> 00:40:44,674
The erasure of one's former
life, former home.

694
00:40:44,676 --> 00:40:47,009
Now, my predecessor,

695
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:49,078
he wiped away
Alexandria, Egypt,

696
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,980
with cholera
in 1609.

697
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:53,816
Today you will
do the same.

698
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:56,686
Do you recognize this?

699
00:40:56,688 --> 00:41:00,623
The Alpha and Omega
bioweapon.

700
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:02,558
Beginning
and the end.

701
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,961
Nyssa stole this
to prevent my heir from doing that

702
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,829
which you will
do today.

703
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:10,666
You will unleash this
on Starling City.

704

705
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:38,319
Greg!
Move your head.
