LANCE [OVER RADIO]: <i>Shots fired.
Units in pursuit of a van across the causeway.</i>

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:11,553
I want air support.
These bastards, they shot one of our own.

3
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:16,308
That cop was just asking for my license,
man. You didn't have to shoot him.

4
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,562
MAN:
<i>Shots fired.</i>

00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:25,859

[CHUCKLES]

00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:38,872
Come on. Damn it.

8
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,209
Nice.

9
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:46,296
It's him.

10
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:47,714
I thought he was green.

11
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:54,596
ARSENAL:
This bike is sick.

12
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,890
FELICITY:
<i>Not supposed to be having fun right now.</i>

13
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:59,601
<i>-Sorry.</i>
-No, sorry is what you'll be...

14
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,479
...when Oliver finds out
you took out his motorcycle.

15
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,732
I've got him headed your way.
Aim for the engine block.

16
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:07,442
There's the green one.

17
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,031
Suit's too tight.

18
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,200
FELICITY:
<i>They make it to the tunnel, we lose them.</i>

19
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:16,618
You're not helping.

20
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:24,543
I thought he was supposed to be good.

21
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:36,888
Who the hell are you?

22
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,774
I'm more of a Glock kind of guy.

23
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:50,235
I didn't say anything.

24
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:01,997
One caught, one got away,
but even Oliver bats .500 sometimes.

25
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,374
-Any luck finding Oliver?
-Not yet.

26
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:07,878
But I have every reconnaissance satellite
I could hack looking for him.

27
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:11,423
So the second he steps outside, we'll know.

28
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,425
If he steps outside.

29
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:17,888
-It's what we were all thinking.
-I'm not. It's only been three days.

30
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,307
I have to head to my other office for a bit.

31
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:25,228
Okay, I know it's only been three days...

32
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:28,482
...but how much longer
before we actually have to start worrying?

33
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:34,655
I expected this kind of blunder
from Mr. Queen, but not from you.

34
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:37,824
You should have checked with me
before abducting that scientist.

35
00:02:38,033 --> 00:02:41,119
We were just following the trail for Omega,
like you ordered us to.

36
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:42,663
I ordered you to be cautious.

37
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:46,083
That's how you protect yourself
and your loved ones.

38
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,418
We need an extraction team to free my wife.

39
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:51,213
From where? We don't know
where Chien Na Wei is located.

40
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,799
-We have more pressing concerns.
-She has the Omega.

41
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,344
We find her, we find Tatsu.
We get them both out of wherever they are.

42
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,054
WALLER:
If only it were that simple.

43
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:03,517
We've learned that the bioweapon
is actually comprised of two components.

44
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:07,145
The Omega she has is harmless
without its counterpart, Alpha.

45
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,438
And where's that?

46
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,441
Currently in the possession
of the Hong Kong military.

47
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,527
-So it's safe.
-Far from it.

48
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:16,571
The only way to secure
the counterpart Alpha is to destroy it.

49
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,282
And by the time we do,
my wife will be dead.

50
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:24,203
WALLER: Alpha is being kept here
in a PLA military laboratory.

51
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:28,417
The two of you with backup will break
into the facility and recover the vial.

52
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:32,337
It's tagged with a GPS tracker, which
you'll need to disable before extraction.

53
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:34,506
And what about Tatsu?

54
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:39,177
-Stop ignoring me.
-I'm not ignoring you, Mr. Yamashiro.

55
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,430
I'm merely focusing on the task at hand...

56
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:46,226
...which, at the moment,
is not recovering your wife.

57
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:57,070
Ah. All right.

58
00:03:57,279 --> 00:04:01,074
This will be gauntlet pulse test 37 Alpha.

59
00:04:04,286 --> 00:04:07,497
Two-second burst at 800 volts.

60
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:10,959
In five, four...

61
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:15,422
...three, two, one.

62
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:17,841
Damn it.

63
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:21,720
-Clowns?
-Practice targets.

64
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,474
-Clowns freaked me out as a kid.
-Well, you're showing them who's boss now.

65
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:29,478

to modulate the stress energy tenser.

66
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:31,021

67
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,441
-About overclocking the magnetic coils?
-No.

68
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:37,903
About what you're doing
and about me helping you do it.

69
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,030
Save the city, you mean?

70
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,908
Risk your life.

71
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,787
I know you think you're going to be safe
inside that suit of armor.

72
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:50,707
I know there's, like, a gajillion movies
that make it look easy.

73
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:55,337
Well, the Arrow and his partner go out there
every night, without armor.

74
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,923
And one night...

75
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:02,052
...hopefully very far off in the future,
they're not gonna come back.

76
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,763
I don't want that to happen to you.

77
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,813
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Start small.

78
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,398
Just see if you can get the nanite chip
to function.

Dad, I will do what I can.

80

Here he comes.

81
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:36,378
The cop he shot, doc says he may never
walk again, and that's if he makes it...

82
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,172
...because right now, he's 50-50.

83
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:42,676
All right, Miss Lance, you're up.

<i>The People v. Jermaine Fisher.</i>

85
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:51,601
Mr. Fisher is charged with 41 counts
of attempted murder...

86
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:56,064
...including 16 counts of attempted murder
of a police officer.

87
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:58,441
So no bail is what you're saying?

88
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,861
Vigorously, Your Honor.

89
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:04,614
Just as the defendant vigorously moves
to dismiss all charges.

90
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:08,827
Mr. Fisher's apprehension was not affected
by the police, but rather by vigilantes.

91
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:11,913
The circumstances of Mr. Fisher's arrest
are irrelevant.

92
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:15,292
Produce the Arrow as an eyewitness,
and we'll find out.

93
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,544
That won't be necessary.

94
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:23,800
We have the weapon with Mr. Fisher's
fingerprints all over it, Your Honor.

95
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:27,012
Motion to dismiss, denied. Bail, denied.

96
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,222
Please remand Mr. Fisher into custody.

97
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,192
How'd it go at A.R.G.U.S.?

98
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,613
Lyla tapped all of her worldwide contacts.
No sign of Oliver.

99
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,616
-No idea where he could be.
-He'll tell us when he gets back.

100
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,201
Until then, we should focus
on keeping the lights on.

101
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:54,247
The shooters we took on last night,
I've been trying to find the one that got away.

102
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:57,416
Jose Anton. Anton is attached
to a new crew working the Glades...

103
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:00,337
...the head of which is this gentleman.

104
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:04,549
I know that guy. That's Danny Brickwell.
His street name's Brick.

105
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:08,386
-But I thought he was in Iron Heights.
-He was until a week ago.

106
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,513
And then the case against him imploded...

107
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:14,309
...by which I mean every single witness
suffered some sort of fatal accident.

108
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,728
Three guesses as to who the police suspect.

109
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:20,982
Jermaine Fisher
and the guy who got away last night.

110
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:22,275
Jose Anton.

111
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,863
So they kill witnesses in order to get Brick
out of prison, then shoot a cop to do what?

112
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:30,951
-That's what we have to find out.
-I'll hit the streets.

113
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:42,087
You have that look you always get
right before you tell Oliver something sagely.

114
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,047
Yes, and this is about Oliver.

115
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,424
You think I'm in denial?

116
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:50,303
I think Oliver challenged
the world's greatest assassin to a duel.

117
00:07:51,096 --> 00:07:53,139
He survived Lian Yu...

118
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:55,809
...and Hong Kong,
and God knows what else.

119
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,228
He defeated Malcolm Merlyn...

120
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,563
...and Slade Wilson.

121
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:06,069
-You have to believe in him.
-Oh, I do believe in him, Felicity.

122
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,239
It's just I'm preparing myself
for the possibility...

123
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:11,783
...that things didn't go Oliver's way.

124
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,953
Not this time.

125
00:08:17,122 --> 00:08:19,457
You need to prepare yourself too.

126
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:29,592
Please, Oliver, where are you?

127
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,672
Y'all best step off.

128
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,133
Brick is a friend of mine.

129
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,677
BRICK:
You're more than a friend, Anton.

130
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:15,430
You're like a brother.

131
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:22,562
Always had my back, always loyal.

132
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,647
Stand up.

133
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:31,154
So when they told me
someone ignored my orders to lay low...

134
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:35,158
...when they told me
one of my crew shot a cop...

135
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:38,578
...I beat the man who said it was you.

136
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,289
I'm sorry.

137
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:44,209
Danny, that cop...

138
00:09:45,043 --> 00:09:46,336
...it was a mistake.

139
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:51,466
What we're planning here
requires two things.

140
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,552
No mistakes
and the cops not knowing anything.

141
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,514
They still don't.
Fisher's not gonna say anything.

142
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,016
Was this side job his idea or yours?

143
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,781
It doesn't have to be like this.

144

Bro.

145
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,994
I dropped my first body with that piece.

146
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,873
You know the deal.
You take me down first, you walk out alive.

Then why do you keep combing over
the case evidence?

Eight months to put them away...

I'm sorry.

Without the evidence,

I know you don't wanna believe it, Laurel.
God knows I don't, but...

He's not coming back.

Are you?

Are you coming back?

I don't know.

For the first time since I met Oliver Queen...

...I don't know what happens next.

482
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,109
I know it's silly, but I...

483
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:38,363
...still like to think of myself
as Oliver's bodyguard.

484
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:43,785
I just couldn't protect him.

485
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:05,890
It's funny. He was worried
something would happen to me.

486
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,312
I could have killed you.

Heh. It's cute that you think so.

488

Did you hear anything about Ollie?

489
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,444
I'm afraid not.

We're in danger, Thea.

We need to leave Starling City
and never return.

Thank you all for coming.

But seeing as I'm the reason none of you
are sitting in a prison cell right now...

495
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:21,382
...I figure it's the least you could do.

And I'm the guy that made
all the evidence against you go away.

But as you can see...

498

I know he's crazy.

I saw you with that man.

You didn't hesitate.
