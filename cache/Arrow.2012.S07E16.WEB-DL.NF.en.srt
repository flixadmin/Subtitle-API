I DID...

378
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,097
AND I USED TO BELIEVE
BEING A VIGILANTE

379
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,683

HAVE LET THIS GO.

FORGOTTEN THAT HERO,

TO BE HUSH-HUSH.

I'M EVALUATING THEIR FIRM
FOR A POTENTIAL ACQUISITION,

HOW ABOUT YOU SHARE

00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:55,760
OH, I WISH I COULD SAY IT
WAS SOME GENIUS PLAN,

407
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,762
BUT, REALLY, IT WAS LUCK.

408
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:00,556
AN ANGEL INVESTOR BACKED ME.

409
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:02,642

THEY'VE STAYED ANONYMOUS.

412
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,359
SO NOW THAT I'VE
TOLD YOU MY SECRET,

413
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,029
TELL ME ABOUT HALCYON.

414
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,447
WE'VE ENDED OUR ARRANGEMENT.

415
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:18,783
THEY DIDN'T ALIGN WITH
OUR PHILOSOPHY.

416

NO ONE HAS EVER ACCUSED
ME OF BEING IDLE.

785
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:59,402
WELL, THEY SEEMED
TO KNOW EXACTLY

786
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:02,197
WHAT WE WERE PLANNING
AND HOW TO STOP US.

787
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:04,657
SEEING HOW IT WAS YOUR
DESIRE

788
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:08,161
TO EVACUATE STAR CITY,
I CAN'T HELP BUT WONDER...

789
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:11,081
YOU DID NOT TELL ME
ABOUT MOVING UP
THE BOMB TIMELINE

790
00:38:11,123 --> 00:38:12,832
TILL I PRESSED YOU
ON IT.

791
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:16,211
IF I'D KNOWN, MAYBE
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE KEPT
FELICITY SMOAK

792
00:38:16,253 --> 00:38:18,296
IN THE SAME DAMN
BUILDING.

793
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,592
THE ATTACK BY
THE VIGILANTES

794
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:24,427
HAS PROVIDED US
AN OPPORTUNITY.

795
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:27,931
BECAUSE A CITY IN FEAR
DESIRES A SOLUTION.

796
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:32,227
WHAT IS THAT?

797
00:38:32,269 --> 00:38:35,188
THE TOOL THAT WILL ALLOW
US TO TAKE ARCHER GLOBAL

798
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,774
AND ELIMINATE
ALL VIGILANTES FOR GOOD.

799
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:45,657
OH, WOW.

800
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:48,451
SO THIS IS WHERE YOU HAVE
BEEN SPENDING

801
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:50,829
ALL YOUR TIME.

802
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,957
PRETTY MUCH.

803
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,629
STILL NOT A FAN OF
CLEANING, I TAKE IT.

804
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,256
YOU WANT TO START
BY NAGGING?

805
00:39:01,298 --> 00:39:04,425
OH, I'M YOUR MOTHER.
NAGGING IS PART OF THE DEAL.

806
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:08,054
SO WHAT, YOU PROBABLY
WANT ME TO COME HELP
STOP GALAXY?

807
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:11,683
A LITTLE MOTHER-DAUGHTER
VIGILANTE TIME.

808
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:14,102
NO. I WISH I COULD TAKE
YOU AWAY FROM ALL THIS.

809
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:16,980
I WISH THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO THINK ABOUT ANY OF THIS.

810
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:24,196
BUT I KNOW THAT
THAT IS NOT MY
DECISION TO MAKE.

811
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:26,865
YOU KNOW, WHEN I
FIRST LEFT HOME,

812
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:30,702
I WAS SO MAD AT YOU.

813
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:34,873
I LEARNED
EVERYTHING I COULD
ABOUT VIGILANTES.

814
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:36,499
I DUG UP
OLD NEWS STORIES

815
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:39,418
ABOUT HOW THEY
DESTROYED STAR CITY.

816
00:39:41,546 --> 00:39:43,715
I WAS CONVINCED...

817
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:46,301
I WAS CONVINCED
IT WAS TRUE

818
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:50,305
THAT YOU HAD LIED
TO ME MY ENTIRE
CHILDHOOD

819
00:39:50,347 --> 00:39:53,725
WITH YOUR...
YOUR STORIES

820
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:56,686
OF THE HEROISM
OF TEAM ARROW.

821
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,604
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T
WANT ME

822
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,232
TO THINK BADLY
ABOUT YOU.

823
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,986
OR ABOUT DAD.

824
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:08,531
I SPENT THESE
PAST YEARS HATING
VIGILANTES...

825
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:14,287
BECAUSE I HATED YOU.

826
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:16,706
WELL, I DON'T BLAME YOU.

827
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:20,835
I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU
WANTED TO LIE TO ME...

828
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:23,046
TO PROTECT ME.

829
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:27,342
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE
WHAT IT WAS LIKE

830
00:40:27,384 --> 00:40:30,387
HAVING THE ENTIRE
CITY TURN ON YOU

831
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,264
AND TURN ON DAD.

832
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:39,104
MIA, YOU ARE
SO MUCH LIKE YOUR FATHER.

833
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:42,148
OUT ON THAT FIELD,

834
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,483
SO BADASS.

835
00:40:46,236 --> 00:40:48,280
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

836
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,494
MOM, THERE'S, UM...

837
00:40:57,038 --> 00:40:59,791
IT SEEMED LIKE
THERE IS SOMETHING
REALLY PERSONAL

838
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:03,002
ABOUT YOU STOPPING
GALAXY.

839
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:09,508
IS THAT ABOUT DAD?

840
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,303
NO, IT'S NOT.

841
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:15,640
THAT ONE IS ON ME.

842
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:20,979
HOLY CRAP. DID THAT WORK?

843
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,689
HERE GOES NOTHING.

844
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,943
ARCHER, ARE YOU ONLINE?

845
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,993
COMPUTER:
YES, MS. SMOAK.

846
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:37,203
ARCHER IS ACTIVE.

847
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:39,164
HOLY...

848
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,820
GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD!
