1
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:28,649
I feel like you're driving me
to a court-martial.

2
00:01:28,673 --> 00:01:30,716
This is crazy. What did I do?

3
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,319
I feel like you're going to pull over
and snuff me.

4
00:01:32,343 --> 00:01:34,762
What, you're not allowed to talk?
Hey, Forrest!

5
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:36,055
We can talk, sir.

6
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:39,934
- Oh, I see. So it's personal?
- No, you intimidate them.

7
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:43,187
Good God, you're a woman.
I honestly... I couldn't have called that.

8
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:45,791
I mean, I'd apologize,
but isn't that what we're going for here?

9
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:48,609
- I thought of you as a soldier first.
- I'm an airman.

10
00:01:48,693 --> 00:01:50,504
You have, actually,
excellent bone structure, there.

11
00:01:50,528 --> 00:01:53,281
I'm kind of having a hard time
not looking at you now.

12
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:56,200
Is that weird? Come on, it's okay, laugh.

13
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:59,078
- Sir, I have a question to ask.
- Yes, please.

14
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:02,832
Is it true you went 12 for 12
with last year's <i>Maxim</i> cover models?

15
00:02:02,915 --> 00:02:05,084
That is an excellent question.
Yes and no.

16
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,687
March and I had a scheduling conflict,

17
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:09,630
but fortunately,
the Christmas cover was twins.

18
00:02:09,714 --> 00:02:12,591
Anything else? You're kidding me
with the hand up, right?

19
00:02:12,675 --> 00:02:16,554
- Is it cool if I take a picture with you?
- Yes. It's very cool.

20
00:02:20,141 --> 00:02:21,475
All right.

21
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:23,644
I don't want to see this
on your MySpace page.

22
00:02:23,728 --> 00:02:25,313
Please, no gang signs.

23
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:26,981
No, throw it up. I'm kidding.

24
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:30,067
Yeah, peace. I love peace.
I'd be out of a job with peace.

25
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:34,238
Come on. Hurry up. Just click it.
Don't change any settings. Just click it.

26
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:41,871
- What's going on?
- Contact left!

27
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:43,664
What have we got?

28
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:47,001
Jimmy, stay with Stark!

29
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:48,127
- Stay down!
- Yeah.

30
00:02:54,467 --> 00:02:56,010
Son of a bitch!

31
00:02:57,636 --> 00:03:00,473
- Wait, wait, wait! Give me a gun!
- Stay here!

32
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,087
Whoa!

33
00:04:20,553 --> 00:04:21,846
<i>Tony Stark.</i>

38

39
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:39,447
<i>At age four,

40

<i>At age six, his first engine.</i>

41
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:46,203
<i>And at 17, he graduated

42
00:04:47,163 --> 00:04:49,540
<i>Then, the passing of a titan.</i>

43

<i>Tony ushers in a new era

<i>Today, Tony Stark has changed

57
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:48,432
<i>to present this year's Apogee Award

58
00:05:55,648 --> 00:05:56,941
<i>Tony?</i>

59
00:06:09,245 --> 00:06:11,830
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Thanks for the save.

60
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:15,584
<i>This is beautiful. Thank you.
Thank you all very much.</i>

61
00:06:15,668 --> 00:06:17,127
<i>This is wonderful.</i>

62
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:21,006
<i>Well, I'm not Tony Stark.</i>

63
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:28,013
<i>But if I were Tony,
I would tell you how honored I feel</i>

64
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:33,102
<i>and what a joy it is
to receive this very prestigious award.</i>

65
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,937
<i>Tony, you know...</i>

66
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,941
<i>The best thing about Tony
is also the worst thing.</i>

67
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:40,442
<i>He's always working.</i>

68
00:06:42,528 --> 00:06:45,948
Work it! Come on!

69
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:53,038
- We should just stay till the morning.
- You are unbelievable.

70
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:56,417
- Oh, no! Did they rope you into this?
- Nobody roped me into anything!

71
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,519
- I'm so sorry.
- But they told me that

72
00:06:57,543 --> 00:07:00,421
if I presented you with an award,
you'd be deeply honored.

73
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:02,482
Of course I'd be deeply honored.
And it's you, that's great.

74
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:04,216
- So when do we do it?
- It's right here.

75
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,427
- Here you go.
- There it is. That was easy.

76
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:07,886
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, it's okay.

77
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,264
Wow! Would you look at that?
That's something else.

78
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,987
I don't have any of those
floating around.

79
00:07:12,016 --> 00:07:14,143
We're gonna let it ride!

80
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:17,414
Give me a hand, will you?
Give me a little something-something.

81
00:07:17,438 --> 00:07:18,564
Okay, you, too.

82
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,584
- I don't blow on a man's dice.
- Come on, honey bear.

83
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:23,110
There it is.
Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...

84
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,445
Two craps. Line away.

85
00:07:24,528 --> 00:07:26,423
- That's what happens.
- Worse things have happened.

86
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:28,383
I think we're gonna be fine.
Color me up, will you?

87
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:29,509
- This is where I exit.
- All right.

88
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:30,533
Tomorrow, don't be late.

89
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:31,886
- Yeah, you can count on it.
- I'm serious!

90
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,203
I know, I know.

91
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:36,832
Render unto Caesar
that which is Caesar's. There you go.

92
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,505
Mr. Stark! Excuse me, Mr. Stark!

93
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:46,091
Christine Everhart,
Vanity Fair magazine.

94
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,319
Can I ask you a couple of questions?

95
00:07:47,343 --> 00:07:48,844
- She's cute.
- She's all right?

96
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:49,970
- Hi.
- Hi.

97
00:07:50,054 --> 00:07:51,972
- Yeah. Okay, go.
- It's okay?

98
00:07:52,056 --> 00:07:53,891
You've been called
the da Vinci of our time.

99
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,810
- What do you say to that?
- Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.

100
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:58,538
And what do you say
to your other nickname?

101
00:07:58,562 --> 00:07:59,772
"The Merchant of Death"?

102
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:01,398
That's not bad.

103
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:05,277
- Let me guess. Berkeley?
- Brown, actually.

104
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,905
Well, Ms. Brown,

105
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:10,508
it's an imperfect world,
but it's the only one we've got.

106
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:13,303
I guarantee you, the day weapons are
no longer needed to keep the peace,

107
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,496
I'll start making bricks and beams
for baby hospitals.

108
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:16,664
Rehearse that much?

109
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:18,475
Every night in front of the mirror
before bedtime.

110
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:20,834
- I can see that.
- I'd like to show you first-hand.

111
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:23,170
All I want is a serious answer.

112
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,506
Okay, here's serious.
My old man had a philosophy,

113
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:28,008
"Peace means having a bigger stick
than the other guy."

114
00:08:28,092 --> 00:08:30,403
That's a great line
coming from the guy selling the sticks.

115
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:33,222
My father helped defeat the Nazis.
He worked on the Manhattan Project.

116
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:35,891
A lot of people,
including your professors at Brown,

117
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,184
would call that being a hero.

118
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,496
And a lot of people
would also call that war profiteering.

119
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,748
Tell me, do you plan to report
on the millions we've saved

120
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:43,524
by advancing medical technology

121
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:45,943
or kept from starvation
with our intelli-crops?

122
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:49,279
All those breakthroughs,
military funding, honey.

123
00:08:50,906 --> 00:08:52,783
You ever lose an hour of sleep
your whole life?

124
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,785
I'd be prepared to lose a few with you.

125
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,634
<i>Good morning. It's 7:00 a.m.</i>

126
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:14,388
<i>The weather in Malibu
is 72 degrees with scattered clouds.</i>

127
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:17,891
<i>The surf conditions are fair
with waist-to-shoulder high lines.</i>

128
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:20,436
<i>High tide will be at 10:52 a.m.</i>

129
00:09:37,453 --> 00:09:38,746
Tony?

130
00:09:40,164 --> 00:09:41,498
Hey, Tony?

131
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,564
<i>You are not authorized
to access this</i> area.

132
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:08,400
- Jesus.
- That's Jarvis. He runs the house.

133
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:11,528
I've got your clothes here.
They've been dry-cleaned and pressed,

134
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:13,363
and there's a car waiting for you outside

135
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,741
that will take you anywhere
you'd like to go.

136
00:10:16,074 --> 00:10:19,578
- You must be the famous Pepper Potts.
- Indeed I am.

137
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:25,083
After all these years, Tony still has you
picking up the dry-cleaning.

138
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:28,504
I do anything and everything
that Mr. Stark requires,

139
00:10:28,587 --> 00:10:31,381
including, occasionally,
taking out the trash.

140
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:32,549
Will that be all?

141
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:51,109
Give me an exploded view.

142
00:10:51,193 --> 00:10:54,446
<i>The compression in cylinder three
appears to be low.</i>

143
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:56,073
Log that.

144
00:10:59,827 --> 00:11:01,971
- I'm gonna try again, right now.
- Please don't turn down my music.

145
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:02,996
I'll keep you posted.

146
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,891
You are supposed to be
halfway around the world right now.

147
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:07,292
- How'd she take it?
- Like a champ.

148
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:08,978
Why are you trying to hustle me
out of here?

149
00:11:09,002 --> 00:11:10,772
Your flight was scheduled to leave
an hour and a half ago.

150
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:12,956
That's funny, I thought with it being
my plane and all,

151
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:14,609
that it would just wait for me
to get there.

152
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:16,444
Tony, I need to speak to you
about a couple things

153
00:11:16,468 --> 00:11:17,612
before I get you out of the door.

154
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:19,948
Doesn't it kind of defeat the whole
purpose of having your own plane

155
00:11:19,972 --> 00:11:21,241
if it departs before you arrive?

156
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:24,643
Larry called. He's got another buyer
for the Jackson Pollock in the wings.

157
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:26,353
Do you want it? Yes or no.

158
00:11:26,436 --> 00:11:28,522
Is it a good representation
of his spring period?

159
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,817
No. The Springs was actually
the neighborhood in East Hampton

160
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,151
where he lived and worked,

161
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:34,736
- not "spring" like the season.
- So?

162
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:39,199
I think it's a fair example.
I think it's incredibly overpriced.

163
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:42,661
I need it. Buy it. Store it.

164
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:45,998
Okay.
The MIT commencement speech...

165
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:48,935
ls in June. Please, don't harangue me
about stuff that's way, way, down...

166
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,378
They're haranguing me,
so I'm gonna say yes.

167
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,022
Deflect it and absorb it.
Don't transmit it back to me.

168
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,440
I need you to sign this
before you get on the plane.

169
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,442
What are you trying to get rid of me for?
What, you got plans?

170
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,070
- As a matter of fact, I do.
- I don't like it when you have plans.

171
00:11:59,094 --> 00:12:01,138
I'm allowed to have plans
on my birthday.

172
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,723
- It's your birthday?
- Yes.

173
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:04,266
I knew that. Already?

174
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:07,936
Yeah. Isn't that strange?
It's the same day as last year.

175
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:11,398
- Get yourself something nice from me.
- I already did.

176
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:13,942
- And?
- It was very nice.

177
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:17,487
- Yeah.
- Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. Stark.

178
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:20,282
You're welcome, Miss Potts.

179
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:24,453
Okay.

180
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:46,433
You're good.
I thought I lost you back there.

181
00:12:47,059 --> 00:12:51,021
You did, sir.
I had to cut across Mulholland.

182
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:52,648
I got you. I got you.

183
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:54,149
What's wrong with you?

184
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:55,776
- What?
- Three hours.

185
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:57,986
I got caught doing a piece
for Vanity Fair.

186
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,131
For three hours. For three hours
you got me standing here.

187
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:02,699
Waiting on you now. Let's go. Come on.

188
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:05,327
Wheels up! Rock and roll!

189
00:13:13,377 --> 00:13:15,963
- What you reading, platypus?
- Nothing.

190
00:13:16,046 --> 00:13:18,256
Come on, sour patch. Don't be mad.

191
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,051
I told you, I'm not mad.
I'm indifferent, okay?

192
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,654
- I said I was sorry.
- Good morning, Mr. Stark.

193
00:13:22,678 --> 00:13:23,863
You don't need to apologize to me.
I'm your man.

194
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:24,989
Hi. I told him I was sorry, but he...

195
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,449
- I'm just indifferent right now.
- Hot towel?

196
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:27,683
You don't respect yourself,

197
00:13:27,766 --> 00:13:29,202
- so I know you don't respect me.
- I respect you.

198
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:30,560
I'm just your babysitter.

199
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:33,146
So, when you need
your diaper changed... Thank you.

200
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,440
Let me know
and I'll get you a bottle, okay?

201
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:37,150
Hey! Heat up the sake, will you?

202
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:38,711
- Thanks for reminding me.
- No, I'm not talking...

203
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,487
We're not drinking.
We're working right now.

204
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:43,049
- You can't have sashimi without sake.
- You are constitutionally

205
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:44,658
incapable of being responsible.

206
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:47,345
It would be irresponsible not to drink.
I'm just talking about a nightcap.

207
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:48,412
Hot sake?

208
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:51,832
- Yes, two, please.
- No. I'm not drinking. Idon't want any.

209
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:53,250
That's what I'm talking about.

210
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,378
When I get up in the morning
and I'm putting on my uniform,

211
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:58,255
you know what I recognize?

212
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:03,552
I see in that mirror that every person
that's got this uniform on got my back!

213
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:06,346
Hey, you know what?
I'm not like you. I'm not out out...

214
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:09,516
No, no. You don't have to be like me!
But you're more than what you are.

215
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:11,439
Can you excuse me if
I'm a bit distracted here?

216
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:14,604
No! You can't be distracted right now!
Listen to me!

217
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:32,288
General.

218
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:35,917
Welcome, Mr. Stark. We look forward
to your weapons presentation.

219
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,002
Thanks.

220
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,798
Is it better to be feared or respected?

221
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:45,052
I say, is it too much to ask for both?

222
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:48,889
With that in mind,
I humbly present the crown jewel

223
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:50,766
of Stark Industries' Freedom Line.

224
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:51,951
It's the first missile system

225
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:54,853
to incorporate our proprietary
repulsor technology.

226
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:58,899
They say the best weapon
is one you never have to fire.

227
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,942
I respectfully disagree.

228
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:05,072
I prefer the weapon
you only have to fire once.

229
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:08,533
That's how Dad did it.
That's how America does it.

230
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:11,453
And it's worked out pretty well so far.

231
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:12,871
Find an excuse

232
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:16,249
to let one of these off the chain,
and I personally guarantee you

233
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,878
the bad guys won't even want
to come out of their caves.

234
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:42,150
For your consideration, the Jericho.

235
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:54,806
I'll be throwing one of these in

236
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,832
with every purchase
of 500 million or more.

237
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:57,958
To peace!

238
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,753
- Tony.
- Obie, what are you doing up?

239
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:04,297
<i>I couldn't sleep till I found out
how it went. How'd it go?</i>

240
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:06,275
It went great. Looks like it's gonna be
an early Christmas.

241
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:10,178
<i>Hey! Way to go, my boy!
I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?</i>

242
00:16:10,262 --> 00:16:11,781
Why aren't you wearing those pajamas
I got you?

243
00:16:11,805 --> 00:16:13,390
<i>Good night, Tony.</i>

244
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:17,269
- Hey, Tony.
- I'm sorry, this is the "fun-vee."

245
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:19,312
The "hum-drum-vee" is back there.

246
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:22,107
- Nice job.
- See you back at base.

247
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,259
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

248
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,631
What the hell did you do to me?

249
00:18:10,465 --> 00:18:12,008
What I did?

250
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,053
What I did is to save your life.

251
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:18,932
I removed all the shrapnel I could,
but there's a lot left,

252
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,850
and it's headed into your atrial septum.

253
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,353
Here, want to see?

254
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,856
I have a souvenir. Take a look.

255
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:31,736
I've seen many wounds like that
in my village.

256
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,239
We call them the walking dead

257
00:18:34,322 --> 00:18:37,492
because it takes about a week
for the barbs to reach the vital organs.

258
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:40,370
- What is this?
- That is an electromagnet,

259
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,290
hooked up to a car battery,

260
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:46,293
and it's keeping the shrapnel
from entering your heart.

261
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:56,636
That's right. Smile.

262
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:02,475
We met once, you know,
at a technical conference in Bern.

263
00:19:03,018 --> 00:19:05,562
- I don't remember.
- No, you wouldn't.

264
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:08,982
If I had been that drunk,
I wouldn't have been able to stand,

265
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:12,235
much less give a lecture
on integrated circuits.

266
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:13,653
Where are we?

267
00:19:15,572 --> 00:19:17,490
Come on, stand up. Stand up!

268
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,493
Just do as I do.

269
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,246
Come on, put your hands up.

270
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,517
Those are my guns.
How did they get my guns?

271
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,918
Do you understand me? Do as I do.

272
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:53,610
He says, "Welcome, Tony Stark,
the most famous mass murderer"

273
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,528
"in the history of America."

274
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,492
He is honored.

275
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:04,788
He wants you to build the missile.

276
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:08,500
The Jericho missile
that you demonstrated.

277
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:13,254
This one.

278
00:20:18,301 --> 00:20:19,302
I refuse.

279
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:31,106
<i>Tony!</i>

280
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:23,450
He wants to know what you think.

281
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:26,202
I think you got a lot of my weapons.

282
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:39,299
He says they have everything you need
to build the Jericho missile.

283
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:42,051
He wants you to make
the list of materials.

284
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:47,891
He says for you
to start working immediately,

285
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:51,227
and when you're done,
he will set you free.

286
00:21:54,731 --> 00:21:57,275
- No, he won't.
- No, he won't.

287
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:13,458
I'm sure they're looking for you, Stark.

288
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:16,628
But they will never find you
in these mountains.

289
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:22,008
Look, what you just saw,

290
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,928
that is your legacy, Stark.

291
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:29,891
Your life's work,
in the hands of those murderers.

292
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:32,268
Is that how you want to go out?

293
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:37,774
Is this the last act of defiance
of the great Tony Stark?

294
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:40,123
Or are you going to
do something about it?

295
00:22:40,151 --> 00:22:45,281
Why should I do anything?
They're going to kill me, you, either way.

296
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:48,618
And if they don't,
I'll probably be dead in a week.

297
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,078
Well, then,

298
00:22:50,662 --> 00:22:53,790
this is a very important week for you,
isn't it?

299
00:22:56,584 --> 00:23:00,088
If this is going to be my work station,
I want it well-lit. I want these up.

300
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:03,383
I need welding gear.
I don't care if it's acetylene or propane.

301
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:05,694
I need a soldering station. I need
helmets. I'm gonna need goggles.

302
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:08,763
I would like a smelting cup.
I need two sets of precision tools.

303
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:24,571
- How many languages do you speak?
- A lot.

304
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:27,365
But apparently,
not enough for this place.

305
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:29,492
They speak Arabic, Urdu,

306
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:32,996
Dari, Pashto, Mongolian,
Farsi, Russian.

307
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:38,459
- Who are these people?
- They are your loyal customers, sir.

308
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:41,170
They call themselves the Ten Rings.

309
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:52,035
You know, we might be more productive

310
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:54,892
if you include me
in the planning process.

311
00:24:03,443 --> 00:24:05,695
Okay, we don't need this.

312
00:24:07,655 --> 00:24:09,115
What is that?

313
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:12,952
That's palladium, 0.15 grams.

314
00:24:13,578 --> 00:24:17,040
We need at least 1.6, so why don't
you go break down the other 11?

315
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:21,628
What's he doing?

316
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,546
Working.

317
00:24:33,598 --> 00:24:36,559
Careful.
Careful, we only get one shot at this.

318
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:39,354
Relax. I have steady hands.

319
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:42,857
Why do you think you're still alive?

320
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:52,492
- What do I call you?
- My name is Yinsen.

321
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,411
Yinsen. Nice to meet you.

322
00:24:56,245 --> 00:24:58,122
Nice to meet you, too.

323
00:25:38,162 --> 00:25:40,456
That doesn't look like a Jericho missile.

324
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:44,001
That's because
it's a miniaturized arc reactor.

325
00:25:44,335 --> 00:25:47,130
I got a big one
powering my factory at home.

326
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:50,216
It should keep the shrapnel
out of my heart.

327
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:51,968
But what could it generate?

328
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:56,639
If my math is right, and it always is,
three gigajoules per second.

329
00:25:57,098 --> 00:25:59,559
That could run your heart
for 50 lifetimes.

330
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:02,729
Yeah. Or something big for 15 minutes.

331
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:15,074
- This is our ticket out of here.
- What is it?

332
00:26:16,576 --> 00:26:18,161
Flatten them out and look.

333
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:21,706
Oh, wow.

334
00:26:24,792 --> 00:26:26,377
Impressive.

335
00:26:52,445 --> 00:26:54,363
Good.

336
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:57,116
Good roll. Good roll.

337
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:59,786
You still haven't told me
where you're from.

338
00:26:59,869 --> 00:27:02,705
I'm from a small town called Gulmira.

339
00:27:03,206 --> 00:27:06,209
- It's actually a nice place.
- Got a family?

340
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:10,922
Yes, and I will see them
when I leave here.

341
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:13,341
And you, Stark?

342
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:19,639
- No.
- No?

343
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:24,018
So you're a man who has everything

344
00:27:24,727 --> 00:27:26,062
and nothing.

345
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:14,777
It doesn't look anything like the picture.

346
00:28:14,861 --> 00:28:16,445
Maybe it's been modified.

347
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:17,572
The tail is wrong.

348
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:18,656
It's just backwards.

349
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:05,661
Relax.

350
00:29:14,754 --> 00:29:16,964
The bow and arrow

351
00:29:17,048 --> 00:29:19,926
once was the pinnacle
of weapons technology.

352
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:24,889
It allowed the great Genghis Khan

353
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:28,684
to rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine.

354
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:33,022
An empire twice the size
of Alexander the Great

355
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:37,693
and four times
the size of the Roman Empire.

356
00:29:41,322 --> 00:29:42,657
But today,

357
00:29:43,491 --> 00:29:46,869
whoever holds the latest Stark weapons

358
00:29:47,912 --> 00:29:49,789
rules these lands.

359
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,501
And soon,

360
00:29:56,462 --> 00:29:58,214
it will be my turn.

361
00:30:11,394 --> 00:30:12,895
Why have you failed me?

362
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:15,398
We're working.

363
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:17,066
Diligently.

364
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:19,068
I let you live.

365
00:30:21,404 --> 00:30:23,280
This is how you repay me?

366
00:30:23,948 --> 00:30:26,283
It's very complex.

367
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:29,036
He's trying very hard.

368
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,413
On his knees.

369
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:36,752
You think I'm a fool?

370
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:38,796
I'll get the truth.

371
00:30:39,547 --> 00:30:40,881
We're both working.

372
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:49,473
Open your mouth.

373
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:50,850
What does he want?

374
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,227
You think I'm a fool?

375
00:30:57,064 --> 00:30:58,607
What's going on?

376
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:01,610
Tell me the truth.

377
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:03,279
He's building your Jericho.

378
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:08,784
What do you want? A delivery date?

379
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:17,418
I need him.

380
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:21,088
Good assistant.

381
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:29,889
You have till tomorrow
to assemble my missile.

382
00:32:34,662 --> 00:32:37,039
Okay? Can you move?

383
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,375
Okay, say it again.

384
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,961
41 steps straight ahead. Then 16 steps,

385
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:45,548
that's from the door,
fork right, 33 steps, turn right.

386
00:32:53,139 --> 00:32:54,473
Where is Stark?

387
00:32:55,266 --> 00:32:56,725
He was here a moment ago.

388
00:32:56,851 --> 00:32:57,935
Go look for him.

389
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:16,245
Yinsen! Yinsen! Stark!

390
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:18,372
Say something.
Say something back to him.

391
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:20,855
- He's speaking Hungarian. I don't...
- Then speak Hungarian.

392
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:23,419
- Okay. I know.
- What do you know?

393
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:48,819
- How'd that work?
- Oh, my goodness.

394
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:50,876
- It worked all right.
- That's what I do.

395
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:53,574
- Let me finish this.
- Initialize the power sequence.

396
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:54,950
Okay.

397
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:57,203
- Now!
- Tell me. Tell me.

398
00:33:57,286 --> 00:34:00,915
Function 11.
Tell me when you see a progress bar.

399
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:02,601
- It should be up right now.
- Yes.

400
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:03,810
Talk to me. Tell me when you see it.

401
00:34:03,834 --> 00:34:05,377
- I have it.
- Press Control.

402
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:07,880
Got it.
"Enter." "I" and "Enter."

403
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:09,715
Come over here and button me up.

404
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,928
Okay. All right.

405
00:34:14,011 --> 00:34:15,346
Every other hex bolt.

406
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:17,556
- They're coming!
- Nothing pretty, just get it done.

407
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,080
- Just get it done.
- They're coming.

408
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:23,788
Make sure the checkpoints are clear
before you follow me out, okay?

409
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:25,564
We need more time.

410
00:34:26,774 --> 00:34:27,775
HEY,

411
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:31,862
- I'm gonna go buy you some time.
- Stick to the plan!

412
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:33,989
Stick to the plan!

413
00:34:35,908 --> 00:34:37,159
Yinsen!

414
00:37:29,832 --> 00:37:32,292
- Yinsen!
- Watch out!

415
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:48,517
Stark.

416
00:37:49,852 --> 00:37:51,937
Come on. We got to go.

417
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:55,566
Move for me, come on. We got a plan.
We're gonna stick to it.

418
00:37:55,649 --> 00:37:57,568
This was always the plan, Stark.

419
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:00,195
Come on, you're gonna go
see your family. Get up.

420
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:03,615
My family is dead.

421
00:38:04,408 --> 00:38:06,702
I'm going to see them now, Stark.

422
00:38:09,163 --> 00:38:10,581
It's okay.

423
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:15,669
I want this. I want this.

424
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:23,594
Thank you for saving me.

425
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:29,057
Don't waste it. Don't waste your life.

426
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:09,097
My turn.

427
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:53,702
Not bad.

428
00:41:25,692 --> 00:41:27,027
Hey!

429
00:41:49,591 --> 00:41:51,510
How was the "fun-vee"?

430
00:41:53,804 --> 00:41:56,223
Next time, you ride with me, okay?

431
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:29,047
Watch it, coming up here.

432
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:34,136
Are you kidding me with this?
Get rid of them.

433
00:42:42,394 --> 00:42:45,772
Your eyes are red.
A few tears for your long-lost boss?

434
00:42:45,856 --> 00:42:50,485
- Tears of joy. I hate job hunting.
- Yeah, vacation's over.

435
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:53,321
Where to, sir?

436
00:42:53,405 --> 00:42:55,091
- Take us to the hospital, please, Happy.
- No.

437
00:42:55,115 --> 00:42:56,199
No? Tony, you have to

438
00:42:56,283 --> 00:42:57,343
- go to the hospital.
- No is a complete answer.

439
00:42:57,367 --> 00:42:59,178
- The doctor has to look at you.
- I don't have to do anything.

440
00:42:59,202 --> 00:43:00,871
I've been in captivity for three months.

441
00:43:00,954 --> 00:43:04,708
There are two things I want to do.
I want an American cheeseburger,

442
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:05,810
- and the other...
- That's enough of that.

443
00:43:05,834 --> 00:43:08,312
Is not what you think. I want you
to call for a press conference now.

444
00:43:08,336 --> 00:43:09,647
- Call for a press conference?
- Yeah.

445
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:12,215
- What on earth for?
- Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.

446
00:43:24,686 --> 00:43:26,438
Look at this!

447
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:29,524
Tony.

448
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,696
- We were going to meet at the hospital.
- No, I'm fine.

449
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,198
Look at you!

450
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:39,326
- You had to have a burger, yeah?
- Well, come on.

451
00:43:39,409 --> 00:43:41,870
- You get me one of those?
- There's only one left. I need it.

452
00:43:44,873 --> 00:43:47,667
Hey, look who's here! Yeah!

453
00:43:53,048 --> 00:43:54,508
- Miss Potts?
- Yes.

454
00:43:54,591 --> 00:43:55,871
Can I speak to you for a moment?

455
00:43:55,926 --> 00:43:59,554
I'm not part of the press conference,
but it's about to begin right now.

456
00:43:59,638 --> 00:44:00,972
I'm not a reporter.

457
00:44:01,056 --> 00:44:02,474
I'm Agent Phil Coulson,

458
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:04,368
with the Strategic Homeland
Intervention, Enforcement

459
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:05,977
and Logistics Division.

460
00:44:06,061 --> 00:44:08,814
- That's quite a mouthful.
- I know. We're working on it.

461
00:44:08,897 --> 00:44:13,318
You know, we've been approached
already by the DOD, the FBI, the CIA...

462
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:17,072
We're a separate division
with a more specific focus.

463
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:20,826
We need to debrief Mr. Stark
about the circumstances of his escape.

464
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:24,204
- I'll put something in the book, shall I?
- Thank you.

465
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:31,586
Hey, would it be all right
if everyone sat down?

466
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:35,090
Why don't you just sit down?
That way you can see me, and I can...

467
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:37,384
A little less formal and...

468
00:44:42,222 --> 00:44:44,933
- What's up with the love-in?
- Don't look at me.

469
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:47,060
I don't know what he's up to.

470
00:44:47,143 --> 00:44:49,563
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

471
00:44:49,646 --> 00:44:52,107
I never got to say goodbye to Dad.

472
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:55,068
I never got to say goodbye to my father.

473
00:44:58,864 --> 00:45:00,216
There's questions
that I would have asked him.

474
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,285
I would have asked him how he felt
about what this company did.

475
00:45:04,786 --> 00:45:07,664
If he was conflicted,
if he ever had doubts.

476
00:45:08,582 --> 00:45:12,878
Or maybe he was every inch the man
we all remember from the newsreels.

477
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:19,342
I saw young Americans killed

478
00:45:20,218 --> 00:45:24,264
by the very weapons I created
to defend them and protect them.

479
00:45:25,682 --> 00:45:27,058
And I saw

480
00:45:28,268 --> 00:45:33,064
that I had become part of a system that
is comfortable with zero accountability.

481
00:45:33,148 --> 00:45:35,150
- Mr. Stark!
- Hey, Ben.

482
00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:37,861
What happened over there?

483
00:45:38,737 --> 00:45:42,407
I had my eyes opened.
I came to realize that I have more

484
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:46,870
to offer this world
than just making things that blow up.

485
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:50,415
<i>And that is why, effective immediately,
I am shutting down</i>

486
00:45:50,498 --> 00:45:54,169
<i>the weapons manufacturing division
of Stark International</i>

487
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:58,256
<i>until such a time as I can decide
what the future of the company will be.</i>

488
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,984
<i>I think we're gonna be selling
a lot of newspapers.</i>

489
00:46:00,008 --> 00:46:01,819
<i>What direction it should take,
one that I'm comfortable with</i>

490
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:05,889
<i>and is consistent with the highest good
for this country, as well.</i>

491
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:12,020
<i>What we should take away from this
is that Tony's back!</i>

492
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:14,814
<i>And he's healthier than ever.</i>

493
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:18,276
<i>We're going to have
a little internal discussion</i>

494
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:20,779
<i>and we'll get back to you
with the follow-up.</i>

495
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:25,241
- Where is he?
- He's inside.

496
00:46:36,169 --> 00:46:38,964
Well, that... That went well.

497
00:46:39,047 --> 00:46:41,466
Did I just paint a target
on the back of my head?

498
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:43,885
Your head? What about my head?

499
00:46:43,969 --> 00:46:47,013
What do you think the over-under on
the stock drop is gonna be tomorrow?

500
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:50,183
- Optimistically, 40 points.
- At minimum.

501
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:51,559
Yep.

502
00:46:51,893 --> 00:46:55,146
Tony, we're a weapons manufacturer.

503
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:57,899
Obie, I just don't want a body count
to be our only legacy.

504
00:46:57,983 --> 00:47:00,610
That's what we do. We're iron mongers.
We make weapons.

505
00:47:00,694 --> 00:47:01,879
It's my name on the side of the building.

506
00:47:01,903 --> 00:47:04,531
And what we do
keeps the world from falling into chaos.

507
00:47:04,614 --> 00:47:06,574
Not based on what I saw.

508
00:47:07,826 --> 00:47:08,886
We're not doing a good enough job.

509
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:10,221
We can do better.
We're gonna do something else.

510
00:47:10,245 --> 00:47:13,123
Like what?
You want us to make baby bottles?

511
00:47:14,124 --> 00:47:17,377
I think we should take another look
into arc reactor technology.

512
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:21,798
Come on.
The arc reactor, that's a publicity stunt!

513
00:47:22,132 --> 00:47:25,260
Tony, come on. We built that thing
to shut the hippies up!

514
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:28,471
- It works.
- Yeah, as a science project.

515
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:32,225
The arc was never cost effective.
We knew that before we built it.

516
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:35,478
Arc reactor technology,
that's a dead end, right?

517
00:47:35,562 --> 00:47:36,730
Maybe.

518
00:47:37,147 --> 00:47:39,733
Am I right? We haven't had
a breakthrough in that in what?

519
00:47:39,816 --> 00:47:42,360
- Thirty years.
- That's what they say.

520
00:47:44,988 --> 00:47:47,258
Could you have a lousier poker face?
Just tell me, who told you?

521
00:47:47,282 --> 00:47:50,535
- Never mind who told me. Show me.
- It's Rhodey or Pepper.

522
00:47:50,618 --> 00:47:52,954
- I want to see it.
- Okay, Rhodey.

523
00:48:01,337 --> 00:48:02,839
- Okay.
- Okay?

524
00:48:06,134 --> 00:48:07,385
It works.

525
00:48:11,431 --> 00:48:15,602
Listen to me, Tony. We're a team.
Do you understand?

526
00:48:15,685 --> 00:48:18,938
There's nothing we can't do
if we stick together,

527
00:48:19,022 --> 00:48:20,440
like your father and I.

528
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:22,317
I'm sorry I didn't give you
a heads-up, okay?

529
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,985
- But if I had...
- Tony.

530
00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:27,072
Tony, no more of this
"ready, fire, aim" business.

531
00:48:27,155 --> 00:48:29,908
- You understand me?
- That was Dad's line.

532
00:48:30,492 --> 00:48:32,660
You gotta let me handle this.

533
00:48:32,744 --> 00:48:35,163
We're gonna have to play
a whole different kind of ball now.

534
00:48:35,246 --> 00:48:37,082
We're going to have
to take a lot of heat.

535
00:48:37,165 --> 00:48:40,418
I want you to promise me
that you're gonna lay low.

536
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:42,420
<i>Stark Industries!</i>

537
00:48:42,504 --> 00:48:45,381
<i>I've got one recommendation!
Ready? Ready?</i>

538
00:48:45,465 --> 00:48:46,633
<i>Sell, sell, sell!</i>

539
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:48,802
<i>Abandon ship!</i>

540
00:48:48,885 --> 00:48:52,263
<i>Does the Hindenburg ring any bells?</i>

541
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:58,561
<i>Let me show you the new
Stark Industries business plan!</i>

542
00:49:00,188 --> 00:49:04,150
<i>Look, that's a weapons company
that doesn't make weapons!</i>

543
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:07,529
<i>Pepper. How big are your hands?</i>

544
00:49:08,029 --> 00:49:10,240
<i>- What?
- How big are your hands?</i>

545
00:49:10,323 --> 00:49:13,201
- I don't understand why...
<i>- Get</i> down <i>here.</i> /need <i>you.</i>

546
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:21,668
Hey.

547
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:26,214
Let's see them. Show me your hands.

548
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:27,298
Let's see them.

549
00:49:27,674 --> 00:49:29,717
Oh, wow. They are small.
Very petite, indeed.

550
00:49:30,677 --> 00:49:33,221
I just need your help for a sec.

551
00:49:34,013 --> 00:49:36,182
Oh, my God, is that the thing
that's keeping you alive?

552
00:49:36,266 --> 00:49:38,852
It was. It is now an antique.

553
00:49:39,644 --> 00:49:42,438
This is what will be keeping me alive
for the foreseeable future.

554
00:49:42,522 --> 00:49:47,152
I'm swapping it up for an upgraded unit,
and I just ran into a little speed bump.

555
00:49:47,402 --> 00:49:50,214
- Speed bump, what does that mean?
- It's nothing. It's just a little snag.

556
00:49:50,238 --> 00:49:53,616
There's an exposed wire
under this device.

557
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:56,828
And it's contacting the socket wall
and causing a little bit of a short.

558
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:58,580
It's fine.

559
00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:01,433
- What do you want me to do?
- Put that on the table over there.

560
00:50:01,457 --> 00:50:03,251
- That is irrelevant.
- Oh, my God!

561
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:07,630
I want you to reach in, and you're just
gonna gently lift the wire out.

562
00:50:08,423 --> 00:50:10,508
- Is it safe?
- Yeah, it should be fine.

563
00:50:10,592 --> 00:50:12,278
It's like Operation.
You just don't let it touch

564
00:50:12,302 --> 00:50:13,678
the socket wall or it goes "beep."

565
00:50:13,761 --> 00:50:16,281
- What do you mean, "Operation"?
- It's just a game, never mind.

566
00:50:16,306 --> 00:50:20,351
- Just gently lift the wire. Okay? Great.
- Okay.

567
00:50:22,187 --> 00:50:24,689
You know, I don't think
that I'm qualified to do this.

568
00:50:24,772 --> 00:50:28,818
No, you're fine.
You're the most capable, qualified,

569
00:50:28,902 --> 00:50:32,447
trustworthy person I've ever met.
You're gonna do great.

570
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:35,658
Is it too much of a problem to ask?
'Cause I'm...

571
00:50:35,742 --> 00:50:38,411
- Okay, okay.
- I really need your help here.

572
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:39,621
Okay.

573
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:45,543
Oh, there's pus!

574
00:50:45,627 --> 00:50:50,256
It's not pus. It's an inorganic
plasmic discharge from the device,

575
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:52,258
- not from my body.
- It smells!

576
00:50:52,342 --> 00:50:53,885
Yeah, it does.

577
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:56,930
The copper wire.
The copper wire, you got it?

578
00:50:57,013 --> 00:50:58,199
- Okay, I got it! I got it!
- Okay, you got it?

579
00:50:58,223 --> 00:51:01,142
Now, don't let it touch the sides
when you're coming out!

580
00:51:01,226 --> 00:51:02,227
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

581
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:03,704
That's what
I was trying to tell you before.

582
00:51:03,728 --> 00:51:05,956
Okay, now make sure
that when you pull it out, you don't...

583
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:08,900
There's a magnet at the end of it!
That was it. You just pulled it out.

584
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:10,211
- Oh, God!
- Okay, I was not expecting...

585
00:51:10,235 --> 00:51:12,463
- Don't put it back in! Don't put it back in!
- Okay, what do I do?

586
00:51:12,487 --> 00:51:13,488
What's wrong?

587
00:51:13,571 --> 00:51:15,007
Nothing,
I'm just going into cardiac arrest

588
00:51:15,031 --> 00:51:16,383
'cause you yanked it out like a trout...

589
00:51:16,407 --> 00:51:19,160
- What? You said it was safe!
- We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this.

590
00:51:19,244 --> 00:51:21,324
- You gotta switch it out really quick.
- Okay. Okay.

591
00:51:21,537 --> 00:51:23,373
- Tony? It's going to be okay.
- What?

592
00:51:23,456 --> 00:51:24,475
- Is it?
- It's gonna be okay.

593
00:51:24,499 --> 00:51:27,168
- I'm gonna make this okay.
- Let's hope.

594
00:51:27,669 --> 00:51:31,839
Okay, you're gonna attach that
to the base plate. Make sure you...

595
00:51:35,885 --> 00:51:39,430
Was that so hard? That was fun, right?
Here, I got it. I got it. Here.

596
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:41,641
Nice.

597
00:51:41,724 --> 00:51:43,977
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I feel great.

598
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:45,353
You Okay?

599
00:51:46,771 --> 00:51:49,649
Don't ever, ever, ever,

600
00:51:49,732 --> 00:51:52,735
ever ask me to do
anything like that ever again.

601
00:51:52,819 --> 00:51:54,946
I don't have anyone but you.

602
00:52:00,576 --> 00:52:01,577
Anyway...

603
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:10,378
- What do you want me to do with this?
- That?

604
00:52:11,212 --> 00:52:12,547
Destroy it.

605
00:52:13,089 --> 00:52:14,590
Incinerate it.

606
00:52:15,258 --> 00:52:16,884
You don't want to keep it?

607
00:52:16,968 --> 00:52:21,139
Pepper, I've been called many things.
"Nostalgic" is not one of them.

608
00:52:21,681 --> 00:52:25,393
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
- That will be all, Miss Potts.

609
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:27,812
Hey, Butterfingers, come here.

610
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:29,814
What's all this stuff
doing on top of my desk?

611
00:52:29,897 --> 00:52:33,109
That's my phone,
that's a picture of me and my dad.

612
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:36,112
Right there. In the garbage.
All that stuff.

613
00:52:42,285 --> 00:52:46,581
The future of air combat.
Is it manned or unmanned?

614
00:52:46,873 --> 00:52:49,000
I'll tell you, in my experience,

615
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:53,838
no unmanned aerial vehicle
will ever trump a pilot's instinct,

616
00:52:54,213 --> 00:52:55,465
his insight,

617
00:52:55,548 --> 00:52:58,551
that ability to look
into a situation beyond the obvious

618
00:52:58,634 --> 00:53:02,263
and discern its outcome,
or a pilot's judgment.

619
00:53:02,347 --> 00:53:05,350
Colonel?
Why not a pilot without the plane?

620
00:53:05,433 --> 00:53:07,435
Look who fell out of the sky.
Mr. Tony Stark.

621
00:53:07,518 --> 00:53:09,437
- Hello, sir.
- Speaking of manned or unmanned,

622
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,415
you gotta get him to tell you
about the time he guessed wrong

623
00:53:11,439 --> 00:53:14,067
at spring break.
Just remember that, spring break, 1987.

624
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:15,502
- That lovely lady you woke up with.
- Don't do that!

625
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:16,962
- What was his name?
- Don't do that.

626
00:53:16,986 --> 00:53:18,130
- Was it Ivan?
- Don't do that.

627
00:53:18,154 --> 00:53:19,465
They'll believe it. Don't do that.

628
00:53:19,489 --> 00:53:20,656
- Okay.
- Don't do that.

629
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:23,701
- Pleasure meeting you.
- Give us a couple minutes, you guys.

630
00:53:26,621 --> 00:53:28,289
- I'm surprised.
- Why?

631
00:53:28,373 --> 00:53:31,125
I swear, I didn't expect to see you
walking around so soon.

632
00:53:31,250 --> 00:53:33,044
I'm doing a little better than walking.

633
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:34,629
- Really?
- Yeah.

634
00:53:35,296 --> 00:53:37,965
Rhodey, I'm working on something big.

635
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:41,052
I came to talk to you.
I want you to be a part of it.

636
00:53:42,303 --> 00:53:44,823
You're about to make a whole
lot of people around here real happy,

637
00:53:44,847 --> 00:53:47,850
'cause that little stunt
at the press conference,

638
00:53:47,934 --> 00:53:49,519
that was a doozy.

639
00:53:49,894 --> 00:53:54,399
This is not for the military. I'm not...
It's different.

640
00:53:54,482 --> 00:53:57,151
What? You're a humanitarian now
or something?

641
00:53:57,235 --> 00:53:58,653
- I need you to listen to me.
- No.

642
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:02,657
What you need is time
to get your mind right.

643
00:54:04,492 --> 00:54:06,077
- I'm serious.
- Okay.

644
00:54:09,038 --> 00:54:11,207
It's nice seeing you, Tony.

645
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:12,500
Thanks.

646
00:54:20,716 --> 00:54:24,137
<i>- Jarvis, you up?
- For you, sir, always.</i>

647
00:54:24,387 --> 00:54:28,307
I'd like to open a new project file,
index as Mark ll.

648
00:54:29,475 --> 00:54:33,187
<i>Shall I store this on
the Stark Industries Central Database?</i>

649
00:54:33,479 --> 00:54:35,857
Actually, I don't know
who to trust right now.

650
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,836
Till further notice, why don't we just
keep everything on my private server?

651
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:41,571
<i>Working on a secret project,
are we, sir?</i>

652
00:54:45,533 --> 00:54:48,619
I don't want this winding up
in the wrong hands.

653
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:53,249
Maybe in mine,
it can actually do some good.

654
00:55:36,501 --> 00:55:39,253
Next. Up.

655
00:55:39,879 --> 00:55:42,757
Not in the boot, Dummy. Right here.
You got me?

656
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,926
Stay put. Nice.

657
00:55:46,761 --> 00:55:50,598
You're of no benefit at all.
Move down to the toe. I got this.

658
00:55:51,057 --> 00:55:53,226
Okay, I'm sorry, am I in your way?

659
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:01,275
Up.

660
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:03,945
Screw it. Don't even move.

661
00:56:04,028 --> 00:56:07,114
You are a tragedy.

662
00:56:16,958 --> 00:56:19,544
<i>Okay, let's do this right.</i>

663
00:56:20,211 --> 00:56:23,047
<i>Start mark, half a meter,
and back and center.</i>

664
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:28,010
<i>Dummy, look alive.
You're on standby for fire safety.</i>

665
00:56:28,094 --> 00:56:29,512
You, roll it.

666
00:56:31,847 --> 00:56:35,393
<i>Okay. Activate hand controls.</i>

667
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:40,958
<i>We're gonna start off nice and easy.</i>

668
00:56:40,982 --> 00:56:44,151
<i>We're gonna see if
10% thrust capacity achieves lift.</i>

669
00:56:44,235 --> 00:56:45,611
<i>And three,</i>

670
00:56:46,445 --> 00:56:47,488
<i>two,</i>

671
00:56:48,281 --> 00:56:49,407
<i>ODE.</i>

672
00:57:26,485 --> 00:57:28,779
Up two. All right, set that.

673
00:57:28,863 --> 00:57:31,282
I've been buzzing you.
Did you hear the intercom?

674
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:33,200
Yeah, everything's... What?

675
00:57:33,284 --> 00:57:34,452
- Obadiah's upstairs.
- Great!

676
00:57:34,535 --> 00:57:37,014
- What would you like me to tell him?
- Great. I'll be right up.

677
00:57:37,038 --> 00:57:38,247
Okay.

678
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,892
I thought you said
you were done making weapons.

679
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:41,917
It is.

680
00:57:42,418 --> 00:57:46,005
This is a flight stabilizer.
It's completely harmless.

681
00:57:50,051 --> 00:57:51,260
I didn't expect that.

682
00:57:56,557 --> 00:57:57,975
How'd it go?

683
00:58:00,227 --> 00:58:01,896
It went that bad, huh?

684
00:58:01,979 --> 00:58:04,649
Just because I brought pizza
back from New York

685
00:58:04,732 --> 00:58:08,611
- doesn't mean it went bad.
- Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.

686
00:58:08,694 --> 00:58:11,572
It would have gone better
if you were there.

687
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:13,425
You told me to lay low.
That's what I've been doing.

688
00:58:13,449 --> 00:58:17,995
- I lay low, and you take care of all...
- Hey, come on. In public. The press.

689
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:23,250
- This was a board of directors meeting.
- This was a board of directors meeting?

690
00:58:24,293 --> 00:58:26,754
The board is claiming
you have post-traumatic stress.

691
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:27,997
They're filing an injunction.

692
00:58:28,047 --> 00:58:30,091
- A what?
- They want to lock you out.

693
00:58:30,174 --> 00:58:31,443
Why, 'cause the stocks
dipped 40 points?

694
00:58:31,467 --> 00:58:32,527
We knew that was gonna happen.

695
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:34,637
- Fifty-six and a half.
- It doesn't matter.

696
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,931
We own the controlling interest
in the company.

697
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:39,767
Tony, the board has rights, too.

698
00:58:40,643 --> 00:58:44,522
They're making the case
that you and your new direction

699
00:58:44,605 --> 00:58:46,917
- isn't in the company's best interest.
- I'm being responsible!

700
00:58:46,941 --> 00:58:49,944
That's a new direction for me,
for the company.

701
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:54,740
I mean, me on the company's behalf
being responsible for the way that...

702
00:58:54,824 --> 00:58:55,866
This is great.

703
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:59,412
- Oh, come on. Tony. Tony.
- I'll be in the shop.

704
00:58:59,495 --> 00:59:01,706
Hey, hey! Hey, Tony. Listen.

705
00:59:01,789 --> 00:59:05,126
I'm trying to turn this thing around,
but you gotta give me something.

706
00:59:05,209 --> 00:59:06,794
Something to pitch them.

707
00:59:06,919 --> 00:59:10,381
Let me have the engineers analyze that.
You know, draw up some specs.

708
00:59:10,464 --> 00:59:12,651
- No. No, absolutely not.
- It'll give me a bone to throw the boys

709
00:59:12,675 --> 00:59:14,260
- in New York!
- This one stays with me.

710
00:59:14,343 --> 00:59:17,239
- That's it, Obie. Forget it.
- All right, well, this stays with me, then.

711
00:59:17,263 --> 00:59:19,098
Go on, here, you can have a piece.

712
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:20,683
- Take two.
- Thank you.

713
00:59:20,766 --> 00:59:22,703
You mind if I come down there
and see what you're doing?

714
00:59:22,727 --> 00:59:24,353
Good night, Obie.

715
00:59:24,979 --> 00:59:29,817
Day 11, test 37, configuration 2.0.
For lack of a better option,

716
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:32,570
Dummy is still on fire safety.
If you douse me again,

717
00:59:32,653 --> 00:59:35,489
and I'm not on fire,
I'm donating you to a city college.

718
00:59:35,573 --> 00:59:37,408
<i>All right, nice and easy.</i>

719
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:42,455
<i>Seriously, just gonna start off
with 1% thrust capacity.</i>

720
00:59:43,956 --> 00:59:46,041
<i>And three, two, one.</i>

721
00:59:57,845 --> 00:59:58,888
Okay.

722
01:00:00,181 --> 01:00:01,867
Please don't follow me around
with it, either,

723
01:00:01,891 --> 01:00:04,310
'cause I feel like I'm gonna
catch on fire spontaneously.

724
01:00:04,393 --> 01:00:06,163
Just stand down!
If something happens, then come in.

725
01:00:06,187 --> 01:00:08,439
And again, let's bring it up to 2.5.

726
01:00:08,522 --> 01:00:10,149
Three, two, one.

727
01:00:26,707 --> 01:00:29,293
Okay, this is where I don't want to be!

728
01:00:29,376 --> 01:00:30,711
Not the car, not the car!

729
01:00:32,046 --> 01:00:33,047
Table!

730
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:48,270
Could be worse! Could be worse!
We're fine! Okay.

731
01:01:06,372 --> 01:01:07,915
No!

732
01:01:09,959 --> 01:01:11,627
Yeah, I can fly.

733
01:01:16,423 --> 01:01:19,343
<i>- Jarvis, are you there?
- At your service, sir.</i>

734
01:01:19,426 --> 01:01:21,679
- Engage Heads Up Display.
- Check.

735
01:01:21,762 --> 01:01:23,806
Import all preferences
from home interface.

736
01:01:23,889 --> 01:01:25,349
<i>Will do, sir.</i>

737
01:01:32,273 --> 01:01:33,353
All right, what do you say?

738
01:01:33,399 --> 01:01:36,902
<i>I have indeed been uploaded, sir.
We're online and ready.</i>

739
01:01:36,986 --> 01:01:38,612
Can we start the virtual walk-around?

740
01:01:38,696 --> 01:01:41,699
<i>Importing preferences
and calibrating virtual environment.</i>

741
01:01:41,782 --> 01:01:43,075
Do a check on control surfaces.

742
01:01:43,158 --> 01:01:44,702
<i>As you wish.</i>

743
01:02:06,599 --> 01:02:09,143
<i>Test complete. Preparing to
power down and begin diagnostics.</i>

744
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:12,146
Yeah. Tell you what.
Do a weather and ATC check.

745
01:02:12,229 --> 01:02:13,731
Start listening in on ground control.

746
01:02:13,814 --> 01:02:14,958
<i>Sir, there are still terabytes</i>

747
01:02:14,982 --> 01:02:17,568
<i>of calculations needed
before an actual flight is...</i>

748
01:02:17,651 --> 01:02:21,572
Jarvis! Sometimes you got to run
before you can walk.

749
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:25,993
Ready? In three, two, one.

750
01:02:49,266 --> 01:02:51,060
Handles like a dream.

751
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:20,815
All right, let's see what
this thing can do.

752
01:03:20,839 --> 01:03:22,257
What's SR-71's record?

753
01:03:22,341 --> 01:03:26,136
<i>The altitude record for fixed wing flight
is 85,000 feet, sir.</i>

754
01:03:26,553 --> 01:03:29,223
Records are made to be broken!
Come on!

755
01:03:32,393 --> 01:03:36,021
<i>Sir, there is a potentially fatal
buildup of ice occurring.</i>

756
01:03:36,105 --> 01:03:37,231
Keep going!

757
01:03:39,483 --> 01:03:40,818
Higher!

758
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:58,752
We iced up, Jarvis!
Deploy flaps! Jarvis!

759
01:04:01,505 --> 01:04:03,882
Come on, we got to break the ice!

760
01:04:39,126 --> 01:04:40,377
Kill power.

761
01:06:04,586 --> 01:06:07,965
Notes. Main transducer feels sluggish
at plus 40 altitude.

762
01:06:08,048 --> 01:06:12,469
Hull pressurization is problematic.
I'm thinking icing is the probable factor.

763
01:06:12,553 --> 01:06:14,805
<i>A very astute observation, sir.</i>

764
01:06:14,888 --> 01:06:16,688
<i>Perhaps, if you intend
to visit other planets,</i>

765
01:06:16,723 --> 01:06:18,183
<i>we should improve the exosystems.</i>

766
01:06:18,267 --> 01:06:20,853
Connect to the sys. co.
Have it reconfigure the shell metals.

767
01:06:20,936 --> 01:06:24,022
Use the gold titanium alloy from
the seraphim tactical satellite.

768
01:06:24,106 --> 01:06:27,985
That should ensure a fuselage integrity
while maintaining power-to-weight ratio.

769
01:06:28,068 --> 01:06:29,319
- Got it?
- Yes.

770
01:06:29,403 --> 01:06:31,738
<i>Shall I render
using proposed specifications?</i>

771
01:06:31,822 --> 01:06:33,198
Thrill me.

772
01:06:34,575 --> 01:06:39,121
<i>Tonight's red-hot red carpet is right
here at the Disney Concert Hall,</i>

773
01:06:39,204 --> 01:06:43,458
<i>where Tony Stark's third annual benefit
for the Firefighter's Family Fund</i>

774
01:06:43,542 --> 01:06:45,186
<i>has become the place to be
for L.A.'s high society.</i>

775
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:46,521
Jarvis, we get an invite for that?

776
01:06:46,545 --> 01:06:49,047
<i>I have no record of an invitation, sir.</i>

777
01:06:49,131 --> 01:06:50,591
<i>Hasn't been seen in public</i>

778
01:06:50,674 --> 01:06:54,428
<i>since his bizarre and highly
controversial press conference.</i>

779
01:06:54,595 --> 01:06:57,264
<i>Some claim he's suffering
from post-traumatic stress</i>

780
01:06:57,347 --> 01:07:00,976
<i>and has been bedridden for weeks.
Whatever the case may be,</i>

781
01:07:01,435 --> 01:07:04,188
<i>no one expects an appearance
from him tonight.</i>

782
01:07:04,271 --> 01:07:06,440
<i>The render is complete.</i>

783
01:07:06,523 --> 01:07:08,192
A little ostentatious, don't you think?

784
01:07:08,275 --> 01:07:11,361
<i>What was I thinking?
You're usually so discreet.</i>

785
01:07:12,988 --> 01:07:15,616
Tell you what.
Throw a little hot-rod red in there.

786
01:07:15,699 --> 01:07:18,619
<i>Yes, that should help you
keep a low profile.</i>

787
01:07:21,788 --> 01:07:23,665
<i>The render is complete.</i>

788
01:07:24,124 --> 01:07:26,043
Hey, I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it.

789
01:07:26,126 --> 01:07:27,711
<i>Commencing automated assembly.</i>

790
01:07:27,794 --> 01:07:30,964
<i>Estimated completion time is five hours.</i>

791
01:07:31,048 --> 01:07:32,174
Don't wait up for me, honey.

792
01:07:56,365 --> 01:08:00,118
Weapons manufacturing is only
one small part of what Stark Industries

793
01:08:00,202 --> 01:08:03,997
is all about, and our partnership
with the fire and rescue community...

794
01:08:06,625 --> 01:08:09,169
- Hey, Tony, remember me?
- Sure don't.

795
01:08:10,671 --> 01:08:12,172
You look great, Hef.

796
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:15,360
We're going to have a great quarter.

797
01:08:15,384 --> 01:08:19,137
What's the world coming to when
a guy's got to crash his own party?

798
01:08:19,221 --> 01:08:23,433
Look at you. Hey, what a surprise.

799
01:08:23,517 --> 01:08:25,269
I'll see you inside.

800
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:29,106
Hey. Listen, take it slow, all right?

801
01:08:29,189 --> 01:08:31,000
I think I got the board
right where we want them.

802
01:08:31,024 --> 01:08:34,611
You got it. Just cabin fever.
I'll just be a minute.

803
01:08:39,116 --> 01:08:42,703
- Give me a Scotch. I'm starving.
- Mr. Stark?

804
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:45,163
- Yeah?
- Agent Coulson.

805
01:08:45,622 --> 01:08:47,833
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The guy from the...

806
01:08:47,916 --> 01:08:51,253
Strategic Homeland Intervention,
Enforcement and Logistics Division.

807
01:08:51,336 --> 01:08:52,963
God, you need a new name for that.

808
01:08:53,046 --> 01:08:55,048
Yeah, I hear that a lot.

809
01:08:55,841 --> 01:08:59,636
Listen, I know this must be a trying time
for you, but we need to debrief you.

810
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:01,680
There's still
a lot of unanswered questions,

811
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:03,640
and time can be a factor
with these things.

812
01:09:03,724 --> 01:09:05,767
Let's just put something on the books.

813
01:09:05,851 --> 01:09:09,229
How about the 24th at 7:00 p.m.
at Stark Industries?

814
01:09:09,563 --> 01:09:12,858
Tell you what.
You got it. You're absolutely right.

815
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:17,279
Well, I'm going to go to my assistant,
and we'll make a date.

816
01:09:18,739 --> 01:09:20,824
You look fantastic!
I didn't recognize you.

817
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:23,219
- What are you doing here?
- Just avoiding government agents.

818
01:09:23,243 --> 01:09:25,096
- Are you by yourself?
- Yes. Where'd you get that dress?

819
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:27,000
- Oh, it was a birthday present.
- That's great.

820
01:09:27,039 --> 01:09:29,166
- From you, actually.
- Well, I got great taste.

821
01:09:29,249 --> 01:09:30,500
Yes.

822
01:09:30,584 --> 01:09:32,502
- You want to dance?
- Oh, no.

823
01:09:32,586 --> 01:09:35,088
- All right, come on.
- Thank you. No.

824
01:09:45,515 --> 01:09:47,768
Am I making you uncomfortable?

825
01:09:48,143 --> 01:09:53,398
No. No. I always forget to wear
deodorant and dance with my boss

826
01:09:53,482 --> 01:09:57,319
in front of everyone that I work with
in a dress with no back.

827
01:09:57,611 --> 01:10:00,155
- You look great and you smell great.
- Oh, God.

828
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:02,175
But I could fire you if that would
take the edge off.

829
01:10:02,199 --> 01:10:05,869
I actually don't think that
you could tie your shoes without me.

830
01:10:05,952 --> 01:10:07,392
- I'd make it a week. Sure.
- Really?

831
01:10:07,454 --> 01:10:09,956
What's your Social Security number?

832
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:15,212
- Five.
- Five?

833
01:10:16,046 --> 01:10:17,339
- Right.
- Right.

834
01:10:17,422 --> 01:10:19,758
You're missing just
a couple of digits there.

835
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:23,053
The other eight?
So I got you for the other eight.

836
01:10:35,649 --> 01:10:38,693
- How about a little air?
- Yes, I need some air.

837
01:10:40,654 --> 01:10:42,572
- That was totally weird.
- Totally harmless.

838
01:10:42,656 --> 01:10:45,492
It was totally not harmless, by the way.

839
01:10:45,659 --> 01:10:47,011
We're dancing. No one's even watching.

840
01:10:47,035 --> 01:10:48,835
Everybody who I work with...
No, you know why?

841
01:10:48,912 --> 01:10:52,082
I think you lost objectivity. I think
they just... People... We just danced.

842
01:10:52,165 --> 01:10:55,544
No, it was not just a dance. You don't
understand because you're you.

843
01:10:55,627 --> 01:10:58,422
And everybody knows
exactly who you are

844
01:10:58,505 --> 01:11:01,758
and how you are with girls
and all of that, which is completely fine.

845
01:11:01,842 --> 01:11:04,219
But, you know, then me, you're my boss,

846
01:11:04,302 --> 01:11:06,322
- and I'm dancing with you.
- I don't think it was taken that way.

847
01:11:06,346 --> 01:11:09,224
Because it makes me look like
the one who's trying to...

848
01:11:09,307 --> 01:11:11,285
- I just think you're overstating it.
- You know, and we're here,

849
01:11:11,309 --> 01:11:15,105
and then I'm wearing this ridiculous

850
01:11:15,188 --> 01:11:17,941
dress, and then we were dancing
like that and...

851
01:11:31,872 --> 01:11:34,791
- I would like a drink, please.
- Got it, okay.

852
01:11:36,168 --> 01:11:39,087
- I would like a vodka martini, please.
- Okay.

853
01:11:39,171 --> 01:11:43,884
Very dry with olives, a lot of olives.
Like, at least three olives.

854
01:11:44,718 --> 01:11:47,804
Two vodka martinis, extra dry,
extra olives, extra fast.

855
01:11:47,888 --> 01:11:50,056
Make one of them dirty, will you?

856
01:11:54,686 --> 01:11:57,272
Wow. Tony Stark.

857
01:11:57,606 --> 01:11:59,941
- Oh, hey.
- Fancy seeing you here.

858
01:12:03,987 --> 01:12:04,988
- Carrie.
- Christine.

859
01:12:05,071 --> 01:12:06,072
That's right.

860
01:12:06,156 --> 01:12:08,825
You have a lot of nerve
showing up here tonight.

861
01:12:08,909 --> 01:12:10,386
Can I at least get a reaction from you?

862
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:12,829
Panic. I would say panic is my reaction.

863
01:12:12,913 --> 01:12:14,348
'Cause I was referring
to your company's

864
01:12:14,372 --> 01:12:15,766
involvement in this latest atrocity.

865
01:12:15,790 --> 01:12:18,394
Yeah. They just put my name on the
invitation. I don't know what to tell you.

866
01:12:18,418 --> 01:12:20,795
I actually almost bought it,
hook, line and sinker.

867
01:12:20,879 --> 01:12:23,316
I was out of town for a couple months,
in case you didn't hear.

868
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:25,675
Is this what you call accountability?

869
01:12:25,759 --> 01:12:28,470
It's a town called Gulmira. Heard of it?

870
01:12:40,023 --> 01:12:42,442
- When were these taken?
- Yesterday.

871
01:12:42,943 --> 01:12:45,004
- I didn't approve any shipment.
- Well, your company did.

872
01:12:45,028 --> 01:12:46,988
Well, I'm not my company.

873
01:12:48,114 --> 01:12:51,368
- Please, do you mind?
- Have you seen these pictures?

874
01:12:51,451 --> 01:12:52,845
- What's going on in Gulmira?
- Tony, Tony.

875
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:56,206
- You can't afford to be this naive.
- You know what? I was naive before,

876
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:58,184
when they said,
"Here's the line. We don't cross it."

877
01:12:58,208 --> 01:12:59,584
"This is how we do business."

878
01:12:59,668 --> 01:13:02,879
If we're double-dealing under the table...
Are we?

879
01:13:03,296 --> 01:13:05,465
Tony, your picture, please!

880
01:13:07,676 --> 01:13:11,179
Let's take a picture. Come on.
Picture time!

881
01:13:12,973 --> 01:13:16,101
Tony. Who do you think locked you out?

882
01:13:16,810 --> 01:13:20,105
I was the one who filed
the injunction against you.

883
01:13:22,524 --> 01:13:25,277
It was the only way I could protect you.

884
01:13:27,654 --> 01:13:28,863
No. No.

885
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:41,209
<i>The 15-mile hike to the outskirts
of Gulmira can only be described</i>

886
01:13:41,293 --> 01:13:45,005
<i>as a descent into hell,
into a modern day Heart of Darkness.</i>

887
01:13:45,171 --> 01:13:48,091
<i>Simple farmers and herders
from peaceful villages</i>

888
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:49,884
<i>have been driven from their homes,</i>

889
01:13:49,968 --> 01:13:54,222
<i>displaced from their lands by warlords
emboldened by a new-found power.</i>

890
01:13:54,514 --> 01:13:57,559
<i>Villagers have been forced to take
shelter in whatever crude dwellings</i>

891
01:13:57,642 --> 01:14:00,437
<i>they can find in the ruins
of other villages,</i>

892
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:04,357
<i>or here in the remnants
of an old Soviet smelting plant.</i>

893
01:14:09,154 --> 01:14:12,532
<i>Recent violence has been attributed
to a group of foreign fighters</i>

894
01:14:12,616 --> 01:14:15,368
<i>referred to by locals as the Ten Rings.</i>

895
01:14:15,577 --> 01:14:18,955
<i>As you can see, these men are
heavily armed and on a mission.</i>

896
01:14:19,039 --> 01:14:23,168
<i>A mission that could prove fatal
to anyone who stands in their way.</i>

897
01:14:23,376 --> 01:14:25,920
<i>With no political will
or international pressure,</i>

898
01:14:26,004 --> 01:14:28,465
<i>there's very little hope
for these refugees.</i>

899
01:14:28,548 --> 01:14:31,801
<i>Around me, a woman begging for news
on her husband,</i>

900
01:14:31,885 --> 01:14:33,678
<i>who was kidnapped by insurgents,</i>

901
01:14:33,762 --> 01:14:36,348
<i>either forced to join their militia...</i>

902
01:14:37,349 --> 01:14:39,976
<i>Desperate refugees clutch
yellowed photographs,</i>

903
01:14:40,060 --> 01:14:42,646
<i>holding them up to anyone
who will stop.</i>

904
01:14:42,729 --> 01:14:46,358
<i>A child's simple question,
"Where are my mother and father?"</i>

905
01:14:47,942 --> 01:14:50,362
<i>There's very little hope
for these refugees,</i>

906
01:14:50,445 --> 01:14:54,324
<i>refugees who can only wonder who,
if anyone, will help.</i>

907
01:16:27,292 --> 01:16:28,460
Hurry if UP-

908
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:29,753
Put the women in the trucks.

909
01:16:29,836 --> 01:16:30,879
Stack the weapons here.

910
01:16:30,962 --> 01:16:31,963
Clear all the houses.

911
01:16:32,046 --> 01:16:33,715
That one there.
Faster. Faster.

912
01:16:41,890 --> 01:16:42,891
Grab that dog.

913
01:16:45,852 --> 01:16:47,979
Put him with the others.

914
01:16:58,823 --> 01:17:00,200
What the hell is this?

915
01:17:11,836 --> 01:17:13,713
Shoot this dog.

916
01:17:13,880 --> 01:17:15,465
You're all incompetent.

917
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:19,803
Turn your head.

918
01:18:26,578 --> 01:18:28,288
<i>He's all yours.</i>

919
01:19:27,096 --> 01:19:29,158
What the hell was that?
Were we cleared to go in there?

920
01:19:29,182 --> 01:19:31,327
No, they were using human shields.
We never got the green light.

921
01:19:31,351 --> 01:19:33,120
Put me through to State.
They're going to be all over this.

922
01:19:33,144 --> 01:19:34,812
Get those monitors up!

923
01:19:34,896 --> 01:19:36,230
We got a bogey!

924
01:19:36,314 --> 01:19:38,441
- Wasn't Air Force!
- We got the CIA on the line?

925
01:19:38,524 --> 01:19:40,544
I've got Langley on the line.
They want to know if it's us.

926
01:19:40,568 --> 01:19:42,236
No, it definitely is not us, sir!

927
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:43,988
- It wasn't Navy.
- Wasn't Marines.

928
01:19:44,072 --> 01:19:46,574
I need answers!
Can I please get eyes on target?

929
01:19:46,658 --> 01:19:48,910
- Negative, negative.
- Cannot identify.

930
01:19:49,035 --> 01:19:51,663
Get me Colonel Rhodes from
Weapons Development down here now!

931
01:19:58,461 --> 01:20:00,213
We ran an ID check
and cross-referenced

932
01:20:00,296 --> 01:20:02,006
with all known databases.
We have nothing.

933
01:20:02,090 --> 01:20:04,300
Any high altitude surveillance
in the region?

934
01:20:04,384 --> 01:20:06,144
We got an AWAC
and a Global Hawk in the area.

935
01:20:06,177 --> 01:20:07,857
So this thing just appeared
out of nowhere?

936
01:20:07,929 --> 01:20:09,365
How come it didn't show up
on the radar?

937
01:20:09,389 --> 01:20:11,349
Got a minimal radar cross-section, sir.

938
01:20:11,432 --> 01:20:13,601
- Is it stealth?
- No, sir, it's tiny.

939
01:20:13,726 --> 01:20:16,062
We think it's an unmanned
aerial vehicle.

940
01:20:16,145 --> 01:20:17,981
Colonel, what are we dealing with here?

941
01:20:20,525 --> 01:20:23,486
- Let me make a call.
- Sergeant, clear a hole.

942
01:20:27,031 --> 01:20:28,825
- Hello?
- Tony?

943
01:20:28,908 --> 01:20:30,660
<i>- Who's this?</i>
- It's <i>Rhodes.</i>

944
01:20:30,910 --> 01:20:32,996
<i>- Sorry,</i> hello?
<i>- I said it's Rhodes.</i>

945
01:20:33,079 --> 01:20:35,957
- Speak up, please.
- What in the hell is that noise?

946
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:39,502
- Oh, yeah, I'm driving with the top down.
- Yeah, well, I need your help right now.

947
01:20:39,585 --> 01:20:40,962
<i>It's funny how that works, huh?</i>

948
01:20:41,045 --> 01:20:44,424
Yeah. Speaking of funny, we've got a
weapons depot that was just blown up

949
01:20:44,507 --> 01:20:46,235
a few clicks from where
you were being held captive.

950
01:20:46,259 --> 01:20:47,885
<i>Well, that's a hot spot.</i>

951
01:20:47,969 --> 01:20:50,471
<i>Sounds like someone stepped in
and did your job for you, huh?</i>

952
01:20:50,555 --> 01:20:51,699
Why do you sound out of breath, Tony?

953
01:20:51,723 --> 01:20:52,992
<i>I'm not, I was just jogging in the canyon.</i>

954
01:20:53,016 --> 01:20:54,868
- I <i>thought you were driving.
- Right, I was driving</i>

955
01:20:54,892 --> 01:20:56,686
<i>to the canyon, where I'm going to jog.</i>

956
01:20:56,769 --> 01:20:59,164
You sure you don't have any tech
in that area I should know about?

957
01:20:59,188 --> 01:21:00,690
<i>Nope!</i>
- Bogey spotted!

958
01:21:00,773 --> 01:21:03,526
- Whiplash, come in hot.
- Okay, good, 'cause I'm staring at one

959
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:06,988
right now, and it's about to be blown
to kingdom come.

960
01:21:07,697 --> 01:21:09,449
That's my exit.

961
01:21:14,162 --> 01:21:17,623
<i>Ballroom, this is Whiplash One.
I've got the bogey in my sights.</i>

962
01:21:17,790 --> 01:21:19,250
Whiplash One, what is it?

963
01:21:19,333 --> 01:21:20,668
<i>I've got no idea.</i>

964
01:21:20,752 --> 01:21:23,087
<i>- You have</i> radio <i>contact?
- Non responsive, sir.</i>

965
01:21:23,171 --> 01:21:24,331
Then you are clear to engage.

966
01:21:26,299 --> 01:21:27,300
<i>Hit it.</i>

967
01:21:32,138 --> 01:21:35,141
<i>That bogey just went supersonic.
I got a lock!</i>

968
01:21:39,145 --> 01:21:41,147
<i>- Inbound missile.
- Flares!</i>

969
01:21:44,150 --> 01:21:46,778
<i>Wait a second. Bogey deployed flares!</i>

970
01:22:01,042 --> 01:22:02,293
Deploy flaps!

971
01:22:03,503 --> 01:22:04,712
Holy!

972
01:22:04,796 --> 01:22:06,440
That thing just jumped off the radar, sir.

973
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:08,007
The sat visual has been lost.

974
01:22:08,091 --> 01:22:09,759
<i>No way that's a UAV.</i>

975
01:22:09,842 --> 01:22:11,010
What is it?

976
01:22:11,094 --> 01:22:12,637
I can't see anything.

977
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:15,181
<i>Whatever it was, it just bought the farm.</i>

978
01:22:15,681 --> 01:22:18,309
<i>I think bogey's been handled, sir.</i>

979
01:22:27,693 --> 01:22:29,362
<i>- Hello?
- Hi, Rhodey, it's me.</i>

980
01:22:29,445 --> 01:22:31,114
<i>- It's who?
- I'm sorry, it is me.</i>

981
01:22:31,197 --> 01:22:32,549
<i>You asked.
What you were asking about is me.</i>

982
01:22:32,573 --> 01:22:34,075
No, see, this isn't a game.

983
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:37,453
You do not send civilian equipment
into my active war zone.

984
01:22:37,537 --> 01:22:39,515
- You understand that?
- This is not a piece of equipment.

985
01:22:39,539 --> 01:22:42,375
I'm in it. It's a suit. It's me!

986
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:44,877
Rhodey, you got anything for me?

987
01:22:46,045 --> 01:22:49,423
<i>- Mark your position and return to base.
- Roger that, Ballroom.</i>

988
01:22:51,634 --> 01:22:52,802
<i>On your belly!</i>

989
01:22:52,885 --> 01:22:54,762
<i>It looks like a man!</i>

990
01:22:54,971 --> 01:22:57,640
<i>Shake him Off! Roll! Roll!</i>

991
01:23:05,690 --> 01:23:06,816
<i>I'm hit! I'm hit!</i>

992
01:23:06,899 --> 01:23:09,235
It's confirmed. He has been hit.

993
01:23:13,364 --> 01:23:15,366
<i>Punch out! Punch out!</i>

994
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:23,499
<i>Whiplash One down.</i>

995
01:23:23,583 --> 01:23:25,168
Whiplash Two, do you see a chute?

996
01:23:25,251 --> 01:23:27,503
<i>Negative! No chute, no chute!</i>

997
01:23:33,009 --> 01:23:34,427
<i>My chute's jammed!</i>

998
01:23:40,433 --> 01:23:42,768
<i>Sir, I've got a visual on the bogey.</i>

999
01:23:42,852 --> 01:23:45,479
Whiplash Two, reengage.
If you get a clear shot, you take it.

1000
01:23:48,024 --> 01:23:49,918
Major, we don't even know
what we're shooting at.

1001
01:23:49,942 --> 01:23:52,087
- Call off the Raptors.
- That thing just took out an F-22

1002
01:23:52,111 --> 01:23:53,446
inside a legal no fly zone!

1003
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:55,865
Whiplash Two,
if you have a clear shot, take it!

1004
01:23:55,948 --> 01:23:58,326
<i>You've been reengaged.
Execute evasive maneuver.</i>

1005
01:23:58,409 --> 01:23:59,785
Keep going!

1006
01:24:07,376 --> 01:24:09,420
<i>Good chute! Good chute!</i>

1007
01:24:17,011 --> 01:24:19,889
<i>- Tony, you</i> still <i>there?
- Hey, thanks.</i>

1008
01:24:19,972 --> 01:24:22,558
Oh, my God, you crazy son of a bitch.

1009
01:24:23,351 --> 01:24:24,951
You owe me a plane.
You know that, right?

1010
01:24:26,562 --> 01:24:29,023
Yeah, well, technically, he hit me.

1011
01:24:29,106 --> 01:24:30,751
<i>Now are you going to come by
and see what I'm working on?</i>

1012
01:24:30,775 --> 01:24:33,653
No, no, no, no, no, no,
the less I know, the better.

1013
01:24:33,819 --> 01:24:35,422
Now, what am I supposed
to tell the press?

1014
01:24:35,446 --> 01:24:37,949
<i>Training exercise.
Isn't that the usual BS?</i>

1015
01:24:38,032 --> 01:24:39,784
<i>It's not that simple.</i>

1016
01:24:40,660 --> 01:24:42,411
An unfortunate training exercise

1017
01:24:42,495 --> 01:24:45,373
involving an F-22 Raptor
occurred yesterday.

1018
01:24:46,123 --> 01:24:49,502
I am pleased to report
that the pilot was not injured.

1019
01:24:49,585 --> 01:24:53,506
<i>As for the unexpected turn of events
on the ground in Gulmira,</i>

1020
01:24:53,589 --> 01:24:57,093
<i>it is still unclear
who or what intervened,</i>

1021
01:24:57,176 --> 01:25:01,347
<i>but I can assure you that the United
States government was not involved.</i>

1022
01:25:03,349 --> 01:25:04,475
Hey!

1023
01:25:06,352 --> 01:25:08,229
<i>It is a tight fit, sir.</i>

1024
01:25:09,230 --> 01:25:12,108
<i>Sir, the more you struggle,
the more this is going to hurt.</i>

1025
01:25:12,191 --> 01:25:14,151
Be gentle. This is my first time.

1026
01:25:15,027 --> 01:25:17,863
I designed this to come off, so... Hey.

1027
01:25:19,115 --> 01:25:22,868
- I <i>really should be able</i> to...
<i>- Please, try not to move, sir.</i>

1028
01:25:24,412 --> 01:25:26,706
What's going on here?

1029
01:25:31,252 --> 01:25:35,339
Let's face it. This is not the worst
thing you've caught me doing.

1030
01:25:35,881 --> 01:25:37,758
Are those bullet holes?

1031
01:26:05,244 --> 01:26:06,454
Welcome.

1032
01:26:09,832 --> 01:26:11,917
Compliments of Tony Stark.

1033
01:26:12,877 --> 01:26:16,505
If you'd killed him when you were
supposed to, you'd still have a face.

1034
01:26:16,589 --> 01:26:18,674
You paid us trinkets to kill a prince.

1035
01:26:18,758 --> 01:26:20,551
Show me the weapon.

1036
01:26:21,761 --> 01:26:25,264
Come. Leave your guards outside.

1037
01:26:42,031 --> 01:26:44,575
His escape bore unexpected fruit.

1038
01:26:47,244 --> 01:26:49,205
So this is how he did it.

1039
01:26:49,538 --> 01:26:52,041
This is only a first, crude effort.

1040
01:26:52,249 --> 01:26:54,543
Stark has perfected his design.

1041
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,463
He has made a masterpiece of death.

1042
01:26:58,130 --> 01:27:01,300
A man with a dozen of these
can rule all of Asia.

1043
01:27:02,927 --> 01:27:05,262
And you dream of Stark's throne.

1044
01:27:07,056 --> 01:27:09,308
We have a common enemy.

1045
01:27:13,604 --> 01:27:15,564
If we are still in business,

1046
01:27:18,109 --> 01:27:20,319
I will give you these designs

1047
01:27:21,821 --> 01:27:22,822
as a gift.

1048
01:27:24,490 --> 01:27:25,866
And in turn,

1049
01:27:27,535 --> 01:27:32,665
I hope you'll repay me with
a gift of iron soldiers.

1050
01:27:43,634 --> 01:27:46,595
This is the only gift you shall receive.

1051
01:27:49,598 --> 01:27:50,975
Technology.

1052
01:27:52,852 --> 01:27:56,355
It's always been your Achilles' heel
in this part of the world.

1053
01:27:57,565 --> 01:28:00,734
Don't worry. It'll only
last for 15 minutes.

1054
01:28:01,944 --> 01:28:04,363
That's the least of your problems.

1055
01:28:09,618 --> 01:28:12,246
Crate up the armor and the rest of it.

1056
01:28:13,873 --> 01:28:15,916
All right, let's finish up here.

1057
01:28:19,879 --> 01:28:22,798
Set up Sector 16
underneath the arc reactor,

1058
01:28:22,882 --> 01:28:26,427
and I'm going to want this data masked.
Recruit our top engineers.

1059
01:28:26,510 --> 01:28:28,387
I want a prototype right away.

1060
01:28:36,562 --> 01:28:39,732
Hey. You busy?
You mind if I send you on an errand?

1061
01:28:39,815 --> 01:28:42,067
I need you to go to my office.

1062
01:28:42,568 --> 01:28:45,046
You're going to hack into the mainframe
and you're going to retrieve all

1063
01:28:45,070 --> 01:28:47,656
the recent shipping manifests.
This is a lock chip.

1064
01:28:47,740 --> 01:28:49,325
This'll get you in.

1065
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:50,993
It's probably under Executive Files.

1066
01:28:51,076 --> 01:28:53,496
If not, they put it on a ghost drive,
in which case you need

1067
01:28:53,579 --> 01:28:56,248
to look for the lowest numeric heading.

1068
01:28:56,540 --> 01:28:59,060
And what do you plan to do with
this information if I bring it back here?

1069
01:28:59,084 --> 01:29:00,169
Same drill.

1070
01:29:00,252 --> 01:29:02,314
They've been dealing under the table,
and I'm going to stop them.

1071
01:29:02,338 --> 01:29:05,424
I'm going to find my weapons
and destroy them.

1072
01:29:06,383 --> 01:29:07,426
Tony,

1073
01:29:09,762 --> 01:29:11,639
you know that
I would help you with anything,

1074
01:29:11,722 --> 01:29:15,684
but I cannot help you if
you're going to start all of this again.

1075
01:29:15,768 --> 01:29:19,396
There is nothing except this.
There's no art opening.

1076
01:29:19,647 --> 01:29:22,858
There is no benefit.
There is nothing to sign.

1077
01:29:23,984 --> 01:29:27,071
There is the next mission
and nothing else.

1078
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:29,615
Is that so?

1079
01:29:31,784 --> 01:29:33,285
Well, then, I quit.

1080
01:29:36,372 --> 01:29:37,998
You stood by my side all these years

1081
01:29:38,082 --> 01:29:40,918
while I reaped
the benefits of destruction.

1082
01:29:41,210 --> 01:29:43,045
And now that I'm trying
to protect the people

1083
01:29:43,128 --> 01:29:45,023
that I put in harm's way,
you're going to walk out?

1084
01:29:45,047 --> 01:29:49,510
You're going to kill yourself, Tony.
I'm not going to be a part of it.

1085
01:29:49,593 --> 01:29:51,595
I shouldn't be alive,

1086
01:29:52,888 --> 01:29:55,015
unless it was for a reason.

1087
01:29:55,849 --> 01:29:57,726
I'm not crazy, Pepper.

1088
01:29:58,227 --> 01:30:01,397
I just finally know what I have to do.

1089
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:08,529
And I know in my heart that it's right.

1090
01:30:24,253 --> 01:30:26,672
You're all I have, too, you know.

1091
01:31:36,241 --> 01:31:41,080
Sector 16?
What are you up to, Obadiah?

1092
01:31:53,967 --> 01:31:58,305
<i>You did not tell us that the target you
paid us to kill was the great Tony Stark.</i>

1093
01:31:58,389 --> 01:31:59,991
<i>- As you can see, Obadiah Stane...
- Oh, my God.</i>

1094
01:32:00,015 --> 01:32:02,726
<i>Your deception and lies
will cost you dearly.</i>

1095
01:32:02,810 --> 01:32:05,521
<i>The price to kill Tony Stark
has just gone up.</i>

1096
01:32:09,525 --> 01:32:13,946
So, what are we going to do about this?

1097
01:32:25,916 --> 01:32:29,211
I know what you're going through,
Pepper.

1098
01:32:36,927 --> 01:32:40,639
Tony. He always gets the good stuff,
doesn't he?

1099
01:33:02,244 --> 01:33:06,623
I was so happy when he came home.

1100
01:33:06,707 --> 01:33:09,501
It was like we got him back
from the dead.

1101
01:33:12,546 --> 01:33:14,506
Now I realize,

1102
01:33:16,842 --> 01:33:20,095
well, Tony never really did
come home, did he?

1103
01:33:21,847 --> 01:33:24,516
He left a part of himself in that cave.

1104
01:33:27,311 --> 01:33:28,896
Breaks my heart.

1105
01:33:31,190 --> 01:33:35,194
Well, he's a complicated person.

1106
01:33:37,863 --> 01:33:41,283
He's been through a lot.
I think he'll be all right.

1107
01:33:47,581 --> 01:33:50,375
You are a very rare woman.

1108
01:33:52,878 --> 01:33:55,047
Tony doesn't know how lucky he is.

1109
01:33:57,758 --> 01:33:59,760
Thank you. Thanks.

1110
01:34:01,762 --> 01:34:03,806
I'd better get back there.

1111
01:34:09,269 --> 01:34:11,313
Is that today's paper?

1112
01:34:12,940 --> 01:34:14,024
Yes.

1113
01:34:14,775 --> 01:34:16,193
Do you mind?

1114
01:34:16,777 --> 01:34:18,612
- Not at all.
- Puzzle.

1115
01:34:18,695 --> 01:34:20,030
Of course.

1116
01:34:23,492 --> 01:34:24,827
Take care.

1117
01:34:48,976 --> 01:34:51,854
Ms. Potts? We had an appointment.
Did you forget about our appointment?

1118
01:34:51,937 --> 01:34:53,480
Nope, right now. Come with me.

1119
01:34:53,564 --> 01:34:54,749
- Right now?
- We're going to have it right now.

1120
01:34:54,773 --> 01:34:56,567
- Yeah, walk with me.
- Okay.

1121
01:34:57,734 --> 01:35:00,094
I'm going to give you the meeting
of your life. Your office.

1122
01:35:01,446 --> 01:35:04,283
Yeah, we've been working
our best to do it.

1123
01:35:04,658 --> 01:35:08,203
Absolutely, we're...
I'm going to have to call you back.

1124
01:35:08,412 --> 01:35:11,081
Mr. Stane? Sir, we've explored

1125
01:35:11,164 --> 01:35:13,476
what you've asked us, and it seems
as though there's a little hiccup.

1126
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:15,210
- Actually...
- A hiccup?

1127
01:35:15,294 --> 01:35:19,131
Yes, to power the suit, sir,
the technology actually doesn't exist.

1128
01:35:19,298 --> 01:35:22,467
- So it's...
- Wait, wait, wait. The technology?

1129
01:35:22,551 --> 01:35:28,557
William, here is the technology.
I've asked you to simply make it smaller.

1130
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:32,603
Okay, sir, and that's what we're trying
to do, but honestly, it's impossible.

1131
01:35:32,686 --> 01:35:39,318
Tony Stark was able to build this
in a cave! With a box of scraps!

1132
01:35:41,486 --> 01:35:44,573
Well, I'm sorry. I'm not Tony Stark.

1133
01:36:00,672 --> 01:36:01,673
<i>Tony?</i>

1134
01:36:04,426 --> 01:36:07,721
<i>Tony, are you there? Hello?</i>

1135
01:36:09,306 --> 01:36:10,515
Breathe.

1136
01:36:11,683 --> 01:36:14,436
Easy, easy-

1137
01:36:16,521 --> 01:36:18,815
You remember this one, right?

1138
01:36:20,525 --> 01:36:22,819
It's a shame the government
didn't approve it.

1139
01:36:22,903 --> 01:36:27,032
There's so many applications
for causing short-term paralysis.

1140
01:36:29,368 --> 01:36:30,661
Tony.

1141
01:36:32,955 --> 01:36:37,334
When I ordered the hit on you,

1142
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:42,422
I worried that I was

1143
01:36:45,467 --> 01:36:47,511
killing the golden goose.

1144
01:36:48,845 --> 01:36:52,599
But, you see, it was just

1145
01:36:53,934 --> 01:36:56,228
fate that you survived that.

1146
01:37:01,274 --> 01:37:05,153
You had one last golden egg to give.

1147
01:37:09,324 --> 01:37:14,621
Do you really think that just because
you have an idea, it belongs to you?

1148
01:37:18,542 --> 01:37:23,672
Your father, he helped give us
the atomic bomb.

1149
01:37:23,755 --> 01:37:28,010
Now, what kind of world would it be
today if he was as selfish as you?

1150
01:37:37,978 --> 01:37:39,646
Oh, it's beautiful.

1151
01:37:42,274 --> 01:37:47,112
Tony, this is your Ninth Symphony.

1152
01:37:49,406 --> 01:37:51,867
What a masterpiece. Look at that.

1153
01:37:53,243 --> 01:37:54,995
This is your legacy.

1154
01:37:57,539 --> 01:38:02,753
A new generation of weapons
with this at its heart.

1155
01:38:05,964 --> 01:38:09,676
Weapons that will help steer the world
back on course,

1156
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:12,012
put the balance of power in our hands.

1157
01:38:13,597 --> 01:38:15,223
The right hands.

1158
01:38:18,351 --> 01:38:22,898
I wish you could see my prototype.

1159
01:38:24,316 --> 01:38:25,817
It's not as...

1160
01:38:27,152 --> 01:38:30,155
Well, not as conservative as yours.

1161
01:38:32,157 --> 01:38:34,993
Too bad you had to involve Pepper
in this.

1162
01:38:35,452 --> 01:38:38,038
I would have preferred that she lived.

1163
01:38:51,051 --> 01:38:53,345
What do you mean,
he paid to have Tony killed?

1164
01:38:53,428 --> 01:38:56,056
Pepper, slow down.
Why would Obadiah...

1165
01:38:57,307 --> 01:38:58,600
Okay, where's Tony now?

1166
01:38:58,683 --> 01:39:00,393
I don't know.
He's not answering his phone.

1167
01:39:00,477 --> 01:39:02,604
Please go over there
and make sure everything's okay.

1168
01:39:02,687 --> 01:39:05,315
Thank you, Rhodey. I know a shortcut.

1169
01:40:11,631 --> 01:40:12,924
Good boy.

1170
01:40:52,756 --> 01:40:53,840
Tony?

1171
01:40:56,468 --> 01:40:57,594
Tony?

1172
01:40:59,346 --> 01:41:00,472
Tony?

1173
01:41:02,599 --> 01:41:03,725
Tony?

1174
01:41:06,394 --> 01:41:07,479
Tony!

1175
01:41:09,689 --> 01:41:11,983
Tony! You okay?

1176
01:41:12,317 --> 01:41:15,946
- Where's Pepper?
- She's fine. She's with five agents.

1177
01:41:16,029 --> 01:41:18,365
They're about to arrest Obadiah.

1178
01:41:18,490 --> 01:41:20,617
That's not going to be enough.

1179
01:41:44,432 --> 01:41:50,438
Section 16. Section 16. There it is.

1180
01:41:59,447 --> 01:42:02,117
My key's not working.
It's not opening the door.

1181
01:42:02,200 --> 01:42:04,369
Oh, wow! What's that?
It's, like, a little device?

1182
01:42:04,452 --> 01:42:05,930
It's, like, a thing that's going
to pick the lock?

1183
01:42:05,954 --> 01:42:08,707
You might want to take
a few steps back.

1184
01:42:27,267 --> 01:42:29,811
That's the coolest thing I've ever seen.

1185
01:42:29,894 --> 01:42:32,689
Not bad, huh? Let's do it.

1186
01:42:39,362 --> 01:42:41,740
You need me to do anything else?

1187
01:42:42,324 --> 01:42:44,117
<i>Keep the skies clear.</i>

1188
01:42:49,247 --> 01:42:50,540
Damn!

1189
01:42:58,590 --> 01:43:00,258
Next time, baby.

1190
01:43:30,372 --> 01:43:33,750
Looks like you were right.
He was building a suit.

1191
01:43:34,334 --> 01:43:36,336
I thought it'd be bigger.

1192
01:44:21,172 --> 01:44:22,340
Take him out!

1193
01:44:33,059 --> 01:44:35,121
How do you think the Mark I
chest piece is going to hold up?

1194
01:44:35,145 --> 01:44:37,439
<i>The suit's at 48% power and falling, sir.</i>

1195
01:44:37,522 --> 01:44:40,233
<i>That chest piece
was never designed for sustained flight.</i>

1196
01:44:40,316 --> 01:44:41,860
Keep me posted.

1197
01:44:43,611 --> 01:44:44,612
<i>Pepper!</i>

1198
01:44:44,696 --> 01:44:47,699
<i>- Tony! Tony, are you</i> okay?
<i>- I'm fine. How are...</i>

1199
01:44:47,782 --> 01:44:49,701
- Obadiah, he's gone insane!
- / <i>know.</i>

1200
01:44:49,784 --> 01:44:51,637
<i>- Listen, you'd better get out of there.
- He built a suit.</i>

1201
01:44:51,661 --> 01:44:53,121
<i>Get out of there right now!</i>

1202
01:45:04,966 --> 01:45:07,302
<i>Where do you think you're going?</i>

1203
01:45:12,807 --> 01:45:15,810
<i>Your services are no longer required.</i>

1204
01:45:16,019 --> 01:45:17,479
<i>Stane!</i>

1205
01:45:42,670 --> 01:45:44,339
<i>I love this suit!</i>

1206
01:45:44,422 --> 01:45:47,675
<i>- Put them down!
- Collateral damage, Tony.</i>

1207
01:45:49,219 --> 01:45:51,262
Divert power to chest RT.

1208
01:45:59,979 --> 01:46:02,106
<i>Power reduced to 19%.</i>

1209
01:46:09,948 --> 01:46:11,074
<i>Lady!</i>

1210
01:46:12,951 --> 01:46:14,994
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no!</i>

1211
01:46:37,058 --> 01:46:40,019
<i>For 30 years, I've been holding you up!</i>

1212
01:46:44,482 --> 01:46:46,943
<i>I built this company from nothing!</i>

1213
01:46:49,195 --> 01:46:51,781
<i>Nothing is going to stand in my way.</i>

1214
01:46:58,037 --> 01:47:00,582
<i>Least of all you!</i>

1215
01:47:10,008 --> 01:47:13,261
<i>Impressive!
You've upgraded your armor!</i>

1216
01:47:13,845 --> 01:47:16,556
<i>I've made some upgrades of my own!</i>

1217
01:47:24,897 --> 01:47:26,858
<i>Sir, it appears that his suit can fly.</i>

1218
01:47:26,941 --> 01:47:28,610
Duly noted.
Take me to maximum altitude.

1219
01:47:28,693 --> 01:47:30,987
<i>With only 15% power,
the odds of reaching that...</i>

1220
01:47:31,070 --> 01:47:33,239
I know the math! Do it!

1221
01:47:41,539 --> 01:47:43,833
Sir, you're not going to believe this.
That thing is back.

1222
01:47:43,916 --> 01:47:46,544
Get me Major Allen. Scramble the jets!

1223
01:47:49,255 --> 01:47:52,258
Not necessary, people.
Just a training exercise.

1224
01:47:52,342 --> 01:47:53,593
Yes, sir.

1225
01:48:01,559 --> 01:48:03,478
<i>- Thirteen percent power, sir.
- Climb!</i>

1226
01:48:07,482 --> 01:48:09,525
<i>- Eleven percent.</i>
- Keep <i>going!</i>

1227
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:18,368
<i>- Seven percent power.
- Just</i> leave <i>it on the screen!</i>

1228
01:48:18,451 --> 01:48:20,078
Stop telling me!

1229
01:48:29,754 --> 01:48:34,342
<i>You had a great idea, Tony, but my
suit is more advanced in every way!</i>

1230
01:48:34,926 --> 01:48:36,969
<i>How'd you solve the icing problem?</i>

1231
01:48:37,053 --> 01:48:38,554
Icing problem?

1232
01:48:40,765 --> 01:48:43,101
<i>Might want to look into it.</i>

1233
01:48:54,779 --> 01:48:56,114
<i>Two percent.</i>

1234
01:48:58,241 --> 01:49:01,119
<i>We are now running
on emergency backup power.</i>

1235
01:49:12,755 --> 01:49:16,217
- Potts!
- Tony! Oh, my God, are you okay?

1236
01:49:16,300 --> 01:49:20,430
I'm almost out of power. I've got to get
out of this thing. I'll be right there.

1237
01:49:20,513 --> 01:49:21,931
<i>Nice try!</i>

1238
01:49:34,485 --> 01:49:38,614
<i>- Weapons status?
- Repulsors offline. Missiles offline.</i>

1239
01:49:42,869 --> 01:49:44,454
Flares!

1240
01:49:52,962 --> 01:49:55,006
<i>Very clever, Tony.</i>

1241
01:50:00,344 --> 01:50:02,805
- Potts?
- Tony!

1242
01:50:02,889 --> 01:50:03,890
This isn't working.

1243
01:50:03,973 --> 01:50:06,326
We're going to have to overload
the reactor and blast the roof.

1244
01:50:06,350 --> 01:50:09,228
- Well, how are you going to do that?
- You're going to do it.

1245
01:50:09,312 --> 01:50:11,773
Go to the central console,
open up all the circuits.

1246
01:50:11,856 --> 01:50:13,333
When I get clear of the roof,
I'll let you know.

1247
01:50:13,357 --> 01:50:15,943
You're going to hit
the master bypass button.

1248
01:50:16,027 --> 01:50:17,507
It's going to fry everything up here.

1249
01:50:19,572 --> 01:50:21,866
Okay. I'm going in now.

1250
01:50:21,949 --> 01:50:25,203
Make sure you wait till I clear the roof.
I'll buy you some time.

1251
01:50:34,712 --> 01:50:36,547
<i>This looks important!</i>

1252
01:50:57,401 --> 01:51:00,196
I never had a taste for this sort of thing,

1253
01:51:00,279 --> 01:51:04,408
but I must admit,
I'm deeply enjoying the suit!

1254
01:51:12,667 --> 01:51:15,169
You finally outdid yourself, Tony!

1255
01:51:17,547 --> 01:51:19,674
You'd have made your father proud!

1256
01:51:24,637 --> 01:51:27,139
It's ready, Tony! Get off the roof!

1257
01:51:46,659 --> 01:51:47,994
Tony!

1258
01:51:49,203 --> 01:51:50,830
How ironic, Tony!

1259
01:51:52,623 --> 01:51:57,545
Trying to rid the world of weapons,
you gave it its best one ever!

1260
01:51:57,795 --> 01:52:03,676
- Pepper!
- And now I'm going to kill you with it!

1261
01:52:06,721 --> 01:52:10,558
- You ripped out my targeting system!
- Time to hit the button!

1262
01:52:10,641 --> 01:52:14,645
- You told me not to!
- Hold still, you little prick!

1263
01:52:16,689 --> 01:52:19,275
- Just do it!
- You'll die!

1264
01:52:22,361 --> 01:52:23,863
Push it!

1265
01:53:21,420 --> 01:53:23,214
Tony!

1266
01:53:31,639 --> 01:53:33,825
<i>You've all received the official
statement of what occurred</i>

1267
01:53:33,849 --> 01:53:36,143
<i>at Stark Industries last night.</i>

1268
01:53:36,477 --> 01:53:41,023
<i>There have been unconfirmed reports
that a robotic prototype malfunctioned</i>

1269
01:53:41,107 --> 01:53:43,734
<i>and caused damage to the arc reactor.</i>

1270
01:53:44,443 --> 01:53:46,755
<i>Fortunately, a member
of Tony Stark's personal security staff...</i>

1271
01:53:46,779 --> 01:53:48,757
"Iron Man." That's kind of catchy.
It's got a nice ring to it.

1272
01:53:48,781 --> 01:53:52,451
I mean, it's not technically accurate.
The suit's a gold-titanium alloy,

1273
01:53:52,535 --> 01:53:55,162
but it's kind of evocative,
the imagery, anyway.

1274
01:53:55,246 --> 01:53:56,914
Here's your alibi.

1275
01:53:57,748 --> 01:53:58,833
Okay.

1276
01:53:58,916 --> 01:54:01,085
- You were on your yacht.
- Yeah.

1277
01:54:01,168 --> 01:54:03,295
We have port papers that put you
in Avalon all night,

1278
01:54:03,379 --> 01:54:05,099
and sworn statements
from 50 of your guests.

1279
01:54:05,172 --> 01:54:08,300
See, I was thinking maybe we should
say it was just Pepper and me

1280
01:54:08,384 --> 01:54:10,177
alone on the island.

1281
01:54:11,470 --> 01:54:12,823
- That's what happened.
- All right.

1282
01:54:12,847 --> 01:54:14,974
Just read it, word for word.

1283
01:54:16,892 --> 01:54:18,894
There's nothing about Stane here.

1284
01:54:18,978 --> 01:54:21,772
That's being handled. He's on vacation.

1285
01:54:22,648 --> 01:54:25,109
Small aircraft have
such a poor safety record.

1286
01:54:25,192 --> 01:54:27,695
But what about the whole cover story
that it's a bodyguard?

1287
01:54:27,778 --> 01:54:30,698
He's my... I mean, is that...
That's kind of flimsy, don't you think?

1288
01:54:30,781 --> 01:54:33,075
This isn't my first rodeo, Mr. Stark.

1289
01:54:33,159 --> 01:54:37,163
Just stick to the official statement,
and soon, this will all be behind you.

1290
01:54:37,246 --> 01:54:39,498
You've got 90 seconds.

1291
01:54:42,376 --> 01:54:44,045
Agent Coulson?

1292
01:54:44,712 --> 01:54:49,216
I just wanted to say thank you very much
for all of your help.

1293
01:54:49,300 --> 01:54:52,219
That's what we do.
You'll be hearing from us.

1294
01:54:52,470 --> 01:54:55,848
- From the Strategic Homeland...
- Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.

1295
01:54:56,182 --> 01:54:57,349
Right.

1296
01:54:58,309 --> 01:55:02,229
- Let's get this show on the road.
- You know, it's actually not that bad.

1297
01:55:02,313 --> 01:55:04,607
Even I don't think I'm Iron Man.

1298
01:55:04,690 --> 01:55:06,233
- You're not Iron Man.
- Am so.

1299
01:55:06,317 --> 01:55:08,778
- You're not.
- All right, suit yourself.

1300
01:55:08,861 --> 01:55:12,865
You know, if I were Iron Man, I'd have
this girlfriend who knew my true identity.

1301
01:55:12,948 --> 01:55:15,552
She'd be a wreck, 'cause she'd always
be worrying that I was going to die,

1302
01:55:15,576 --> 01:55:17,953
yet so proud of the man I'd become.

1303
01:55:18,037 --> 01:55:21,791
She'd be wildly conflicted,
which would only make her more

1304
01:55:23,501 --> 01:55:24,543
crazy about me.

1305
01:55:24,627 --> 01:55:26,295
Tell me you never think about that night.

1306
01:55:26,378 --> 01:55:28,255
- What night?
- You know.

1307
01:55:31,175 --> 01:55:36,972
Are you talking about the night that
we danced and went up on the roof,

1308
01:55:38,599 --> 01:55:44,188
and then you went downstairs
to get me a drink,

1309
01:55:44,271 --> 01:55:47,525
and you left me there, by myself?

1310
01:55:48,734 --> 01:55:51,278
Is that the night you're talking about?

1311
01:55:53,447 --> 01:55:54,532
Thought so.

1312
01:55:57,243 --> 01:56:00,996
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
- Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts.

1313
01:56:01,080 --> 01:56:04,625
<i>And now, Mr. Stark has
prepared a statement.</i>

1314
01:56:04,708 --> 01:56:07,753
<i>He will not be taking any questions.
Thank you.</i>

1315
01:56:11,924 --> 01:56:17,054
<i>Been a while since I was In front of you.
I figure I'll stick to the cards this time.</i>

1316
01:56:19,014 --> 01:56:22,059
<i>There's been speculation that I was
involved in the events that occurred</i>

1317
01:56:22,143 --> 01:56:23,463
<i>on the freeway and the rooftop...</i>

1318
01:56:23,519 --> 01:56:26,313
I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you
honestly expect us to believe that

1319
01:56:26,397 --> 01:56:30,151
that was a bodyguard
in a suit that conveniently appeared,

1320
01:56:30,234 --> 01:56:33,320
- despite the fact that you...
- / <i>know</i> that <i>it's</i> confusing.

1321
01:56:33,404 --> 01:56:37,032
<i>It is one thing to question the official
story, and another thing entirely</i>

1322
01:56:37,116 --> 01:56:40,369
<i>to make wild accusations,
or insinuate that I'm a superhero.</i>

1323
01:56:40,452 --> 01:56:42,079
I never said you were a superhero.

1324
01:56:42,163 --> 01:56:47,501
<i>Didn't? Well, good, because that would
be outlandish and fantastic.</i>

1325
01:56:49,503 --> 01:56:52,756
<i>I'm just not the hero type. Clearly.</i>

1326
01:56:53,299 --> 01:56:56,260
<i>With this laundry list
of character defects,</i>

1327
01:56:56,343 --> 01:56:57,803
<i>all the mistakes I've made,</i>

1328
01:56:57,887 --> 01:57:01,223
<i>- largely public.
- Just stick to the cards,</i> man.

1329
01:57:01,307 --> 01:57:02,975
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

1330
01:57:05,102 --> 01:57:06,604
<i>The truth is.</i>

1331
01:57:12,776 --> 01:57:14,278
<i>I am Iron Man.</i>

1332
02:05:17,511 --> 02:05:18,762
Jarvis!

1333
02:05:18,845 --> 02:05:20,597
<i>Welcome home, sir.</i>

1334
02:05:24,017 --> 02:05:29,523
"I am Iron Man." You think you're
the only superhero in the world?

1335
02:05:29,856 --> 02:05:33,110
Mr. Stark, you've become part
of a bigger universe.

1336
02:05:33,193 --> 02:05:34,986
You just don't know it yet.

1337
02:05:35,487 --> 02:05:37,280
Who the hell are you?

1338
02:05:37,489 --> 02:05:40,200
Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

1339
02:05:42,285 --> 02:05:45,288
I'm here to talk to you
about the Avenger Initiative.
