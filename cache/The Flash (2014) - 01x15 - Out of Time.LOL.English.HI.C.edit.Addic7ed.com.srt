00:07:35,905 --> 00:07:38,740
The coroner has multiple
impact bruises on his torso,

168
00:07:38,742 --> 00:07:40,675
all the size of a tennis ball.

169
00:07:40,677 --> 00:07:42,712
Judging by the amount of ice
and water on the ground,

170
00:07:42,714 --> 00:07:44,582
I'm guessing he was killed by hail.

171
00:07:44,584 --> 00:07:46,050
Hail? In here?

172
00:07:46,052 --> 00:07:47,084
Yeah.

173
00:07:47,086 --> 00:07:49,054
Do you think this was Snart?

174
00:07:49,056 --> 00:07:51,424
No, his cold-gun couldn't have done this.

175
00:07:51,426 --> 00:07:53,293
(Thawne) Joe, we got something.

176
00:07:53,295 --> 00:07:54,427
The Coroner's office just installed

177
00:07:54,429 --> 00:07:56,430
an automated dictation system.

178
00:07:56,432 --> 00:07:57,999
Listen to this.

179
00:07:58,001 --> 00:07:59,868
(coroner on tape) Please, no more.

180
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,402
(Mark on tape)
I'll stop when you tell me...

181
00:08:01,404 --> 00:08:02,570
(coroner on tape) Stop.

182
00:08:02,572 --> 00:08:03,971
(Mark on tape) Who killed him?

183
00:08:03,973 --> 00:08:05,440
I know that voice. That's Mardon.

184
00:08:05,442 --> 00:08:07,208
- I want a name.
- Clyde Mardon's dead.

185
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,074
It's not Clyde Mardon.
It's his brother, Mark.

186
00:08:09,076 --> 00:08:11,508
(coroner on tape) It was Detective West.

187
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:15,711
He shot him. Detective Joe West
killed your brother.

188
00:08:15,713 --> 00:08:17,482
(Mark on tape) He will pay for what he did.

189
00:08:17,484 --> 00:08:20,685
[Coroner screaming on tape]

190
00:08:30,383 --> 00:08:32,120
So Clyde Mardon has a brother?

191
00:08:32,181 --> 00:08:34,415
And both brothers survived the plane crash,

192
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:35,814
and then the dark matter released

193
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:37,816
from the particle accelerator explosion

194
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:41,520
affects them both
in virtually the same way.

195
00:08:41,522 --> 00:08:44,692
Yeah, only Mark's powers
seem to be a lot more precise.

196
00:08:44,694 --> 00:08:47,329
To be able to control
the weather like that, indoors?

197
00:08:47,331 --> 00:08:49,398
You'd have to be a Weather Wizard.

198
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,170
Ooh, been waiting since week one
to use that one.

199
00:08:52,172 --> 00:08:53,805
- Mm!
- Trigeminal headache?

200
00:08:53,807 --> 00:08:54,906
- What?
- Trigeminal headache.

201
00:08:54,908 --> 00:08:56,442
Brain freeze.

202
00:08:56,444 --> 00:08:57,911
Then why don't you just
call it a brain freeze?

203
00:08:57,913 --> 00:08:59,780
So I'm guessing you
running around a twister

204
00:08:59,782 --> 00:09:02,382
in the opposite direction isn't
gonna to do the trick this time.

205
00:09:02,384 --> 00:09:04,783
I just remembered.
During our run-in with Mardon,

206
00:09:04,785 --> 00:09:06,920
Clyde Mardon,
I was tinkering with something

207
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:09,692
to help attract
unbound atmospheric electrons.

208
00:09:09,694 --> 00:09:11,161
Like a grounding mechanism?

209
00:09:11,163 --> 00:09:12,831
Yes, 'cause the only way that Mardon can

210
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,234
- control the weather...
- [phone vibrating]

211
00:09:14,236 --> 00:09:15,602
is if he can tap into the atmosphere's

212
00:09:15,604 --> 00:09:17,438
natural electrical circuit, and if we

213
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,574
take away that circuit, clear skies.

214
00:09:20,576 --> 00:09:22,244
Singh's checking in. I gotta go.

215
00:09:22,246 --> 00:09:23,845
Yeah, I'll meet you at the station.

216
00:09:23,847 --> 00:09:26,145
Joe, We'll find Mardon. Don't worry.

217
00:09:26,147 --> 00:09:28,915
I'm not worried at all.

218
00:09:28,917 --> 00:09:31,352
Well, he's taking being targeted

219
00:09:31,354 --> 00:09:34,455
by a revenge-seeking meta-human
rather well, I must say.

220
00:09:34,457 --> 00:09:37,626
Don't worry, Barry.
Joe will be fine, I promise.

221
00:09:37,628 --> 00:09:39,297
Yeah, no, I know.

222
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:41,131
I actually wanted to talk to you
about something else.

223
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:42,565
- Mm-hmm?
- Um...

224
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:46,472
Look, last night, on my way to the morgue,

225
00:09:46,474 --> 00:09:47,674
I saw something.

226
00:09:47,676 --> 00:09:49,043
What'd you see?

227
00:09:49,045 --> 00:09:53,581
I was running and I turned
and I saw myself.

228
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:57,885
Or I don't know, another Flash
running beside me.

229
00:09:57,887 --> 00:09:59,185
Interesting.

230
00:09:59,187 --> 00:10:01,350
Yeah. What do you think it was?

231
00:10:01,352 --> 00:10:03,018
Could be an optical illusion,
a mirroring effect

232
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,759
caused by wind shear and light,
a speed mirage, if you will.

233
00:10:06,761 --> 00:10:10,664
It didn't seem like that. It was...

234
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,800
He seemed real.

235
00:10:12,802 --> 00:10:16,302
I tell you what.
Let's focus on finding Mardon,

236
00:10:16,304 --> 00:10:19,071
and once he's safely contained
in The Pipeline,

237
00:10:19,073 --> 00:10:21,708
we'll investigate this.

238
00:10:27,184 --> 00:10:28,616
(Captain Singh)
Where are we at with Mardon?

239
00:10:28,618 --> 00:10:30,552
No one at the morgue saw or heard anything.

240
00:10:30,554 --> 00:10:31,820
We're canvassing known associates,

241
00:10:31,822 --> 00:10:33,354
seeing if he reached out to anybody.

242
00:10:33,356 --> 00:10:35,256
Maybe can get a lead
on where he's holed up.

243
00:10:35,258 --> 00:10:36,957
All right, why don't we let Thawne do that?

244
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,125
Because nobody knows the Mardon
brothers better than I do.

245
00:10:39,127 --> 00:10:41,063
I mean, Chyre and I tracked them for years.

246
00:10:41,065 --> 00:10:42,198
I know how they think.

247
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,432
Which is why you should coordinate

248
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:46,404
the investigation from here.

249
00:10:56,082 --> 00:10:58,918
Hey.

250
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,291
(West) If you guys want to keep that smile

251
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:03,962
on that pretty face, she doesn't
hear about any of this.

252
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:05,598
Mm-hmm.

253
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,500
Hey, sweetheart.

254
00:11:06,502 --> 00:11:08,871
- Hey, Dad.
- Mm.

255
00:11:08,873 --> 00:11:10,574
- Hi.
- Hey.

256
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:15,213
So, what are you guys working on?

257
00:11:15,215 --> 00:11:17,415
You got any good leads
for an honest reporter?

258
00:11:17,417 --> 00:11:21,055
Things are actually pretty quiet
around here right now.

259
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,697
Can you guys give me a minute?

260
00:11:25,699 --> 00:11:27,934
Yeah, me and Barry were actually
gonna go grab lunch.

261
00:11:27,936 --> 00:11:29,136
We were?

262
00:11:29,138 --> 00:11:31,405
Right, yeah, yeah. [chuckles]

263
00:11:31,407 --> 00:11:33,006
Duh.

264
00:11:34,376 --> 00:11:36,545
Hey. Ever since last night,

265
00:11:36,547 --> 00:11:40,983
you've barely said a peep.
What is going on?

266
00:11:40,985 --> 00:11:42,217
I didn't like the way I felt

267
00:11:42,219 --> 00:11:44,587
watching you and Barry last night.

268
00:11:44,589 --> 00:11:46,757
Eddie, Barry, he's just...

269
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:48,992
Like family. I know, and I know

270
00:11:48,994 --> 00:11:50,692
you two have a long history
that pre-dates me,

271
00:11:50,694 --> 00:11:53,863
but Iris, we live together.
You're my girlfriend,

272
00:11:53,865 --> 00:11:58,368
and someday, hopefully, you'll be more.

273
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:00,938
I don't like feeling like the odd man out

274
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,542
every time you and Barry are together.

275
00:12:02,544 --> 00:12:04,044
And I shouldn't have to.

276
00:12:04,046 --> 00:12:07,350
Eddie, Barry is always
gonna be a part of my life.

277
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:12,688
I get that, but something's
changed between you two.

278
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:16,390
Whatever that is, I am not okay with it.

279
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,693
[sighs]

280
00:12:22,695 --> 00:12:24,495
Mm.

281
00:12:24,497 --> 00:12:26,565
I haven't had one of those in way too long.

282
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:29,568
Felt appropriate.

283
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:33,741
So, you want to talk about
what's been going on with you?

284
00:12:33,743 --> 00:12:35,308
What do you think's been
going on with me, Barry?

285
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,741
You just seem a bit cavalier,

286
00:12:36,743 --> 00:12:38,273
considering what we're up against.

287
00:12:38,275 --> 00:12:40,174
[chuckles] <i> We</i> aren't up against anything.

288
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,310
- Joe, come on, I...
- Look, I'm fine.

289
00:12:42,312 --> 00:12:44,045
Can we just change the subject, please?

290
00:12:44,047 --> 00:12:45,780
Sure.

291
00:12:45,782 --> 00:12:48,148
Actually, you know,
I could use some advice.

292
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,515
About what?

293
00:12:49,517 --> 00:12:53,115
Uh, you know, just relationship stuff.

294
00:12:53,117 --> 00:12:55,683
Oh, you mean, like, that girl, Linda?

295
00:12:55,685 --> 00:12:59,183
No, actually. With Iris.

296
00:12:59,185 --> 00:13:03,719
Things between us have gotten
a little complicated... again.

297
00:13:03,721 --> 00:13:05,520
[laughs]

298
00:13:05,522 --> 00:13:07,988
You're asking your adopted father

299
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:11,090
for advice about being in love
with his daughter,

300
00:13:11,092 --> 00:13:13,825
who just so happens to be
dating his partner?

301
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:15,025
I know, I know.

302
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:17,661
Things have gone way past complicated.

303
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:19,928
Sometimes, me and Iris have these moments,

304
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,830
and when I'm looking into her eyes,

305
00:13:22,832 --> 00:13:26,802
it's hard not to think that
she's feeling the same way I do.

306
00:13:26,804 --> 00:13:29,535
Look, you already told Iris how you feel,

307
00:13:29,537 --> 00:13:33,007
so unless she comes out and
says she feels the same way,

308
00:13:33,009 --> 00:13:35,312
all you can do is hold on to those moments.

309
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,313
Man, it is coming down.

310
00:13:37,315 --> 00:13:38,313
Yeah.

311
00:13:38,315 --> 00:13:39,816

beautiful day here in Central City.

314
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:45,521
Not a cloud.

315
00:13:47,224 --> 00:13:49,059
Mardon.

[sparking]

318

You're confined to the precinct
until Mardon's caught.

319
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,746
David, you said it yourself.

320
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,515
That son of a bitch killed my partner.

321
00:14:28,517 --> 00:14:30,854
And I'm not gonna lose you
the way I lost Fred Chyre.

322
00:14:30,856 --> 00:14:32,523
Look, I can't stop you being pissed, Joe,

323
00:14:32,525 --> 00:14:35,027
but I can keep you safe.

324
00:14:35,029 --> 00:14:37,264
Maybe your daughter can contact The Flash.

325
00:14:37,266 --> 00:14:40,833
I'm not getting her involved in this.

326
00:14:40,835 --> 00:14:43,637
Allen, make sure he doesn't go anywhere.

327
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:45,775
I need to be out there.

328
00:14:45,777 --> 00:14:47,643
Joe, you're always the first one

329
00:14:47,645 --> 00:14:49,308
to tell me when I'm not thinking clearly.

330
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:51,312
I took down Clyde. I can take down

331
00:14:51,314 --> 00:14:52,647
his dirt bag brother too.

332
00:14:52,649 --> 00:14:56,214
You didn't do that alone, remember?

333
00:14:56,216 --> 00:14:58,285
You're right.

334
00:14:58,287 --> 00:15:01,290
How are any of these guys
going to protect me?

335
00:15:01,292 --> 00:15:03,727
They don't know. They don't know
what Mardon's capable of.

336
00:15:03,729 --> 00:15:05,029
All right, well, lucky for you,

337
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:07,467
your friends at S.T.A.R. Labs do.

338
00:15:09,035 --> 00:15:10,635
[sighs]

339
00:15:18,475 --> 00:15:22,442
"The Flash: Speeding
his way into our lives?"

340
00:15:22,444 --> 00:15:24,208
That's a little on the nose,
don't you think?

341
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:25,208
[scoffs]

342
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:27,245
I want to show you something.

343
00:15:27,247 --> 00:15:29,181
Simon Stagg. Remember him?

344
00:15:29,183 --> 00:15:31,216
Hasn't been seen in, like, six months.

345
00:15:31,218 --> 00:15:33,117
I thought the rumor was he was a recluse.

346
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:35,787
You know, went all Howard Hughes.

347
00:15:35,789 --> 00:15:38,323
This was taken the night
that Stagg went missing.

348
00:15:38,325 --> 00:15:39,857
The last person to leave Stagg Industries

349
00:15:39,859 --> 00:15:43,361
the night that Stagg disappeared
was Harrison Wells.

350
00:15:43,363 --> 00:15:44,897
This doesn't prove anything, Mason.

351
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:47,232
It's enough for me to develop a theory.

352
00:15:47,234 --> 00:15:50,802
Every trail in this files leads
to one person, Harrison Wells,

353
00:15:50,804 --> 00:15:52,406
which is why I need for you to start asking

354
00:15:52,408 --> 00:15:55,679
your friends who know him
some questions, Iris.

355
00:16:04,194 --> 00:16:05,927
Linda.

356
00:16:05,929 --> 00:16:08,063
Hi.

357
00:16:08,065 --> 00:16:09,766
Last night was fun.

358
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:11,204
Mm-hmm.

359
00:16:11,206 --> 00:16:13,374
Oh, yeah.

360
00:16:13,376 --> 00:16:15,707
Look, I just wanted to apologize.

361
00:16:15,709 --> 00:16:17,674
Apologize...?

362
00:16:17,676 --> 00:16:19,942
Well, for interrupting
your date with Barry.

363
00:16:19,944 --> 00:16:24,613
I shouldn't have done that...
and I'm sorry.

364
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:28,121
You know, Iris,

365
00:16:28,123 --> 00:16:30,625
when you told me that
Barry had feelings for you,

366
00:16:30,627 --> 00:16:33,261
I thought it was just
the typical weird crap

367
00:16:33,263 --> 00:16:35,463
that women do to each other,

368
00:16:35,465 --> 00:16:38,602
but last night, I realized
what you didn't tell me,

369
00:16:38,604 --> 00:16:40,839
and what's kind of irritating

370
00:16:40,841 --> 00:16:44,842
is that you have feelings for him too.

371
00:16:44,844 --> 00:16:47,176
N... No, Linda, I mean, it's not like that.

372
00:16:47,178 --> 00:16:49,878
One thing you learn about people
when you work here, Iris,

373
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,616
it's usually what isn't said
that's the real story.

374
00:17:01,358 --> 00:17:04,093
So it sounded like something
was kind of bothering you

375
00:17:04,095 --> 00:17:05,995
on the phone. Is everything all right?

376
00:17:05,997 --> 00:17:07,729
Yeah, it's fine.

377
00:17:07,731 --> 00:17:09,129
So the other night was fun, right?

378
00:17:09,131 --> 00:17:10,764
Yeah. Did Eddie have a good time?

379
00:17:10,766 --> 00:17:13,001
Yeah. Linda?

380
00:17:13,003 --> 00:17:14,470
I think so.

381
00:17:14,472 --> 00:17:18,471
You don't think we were too... you know.

382
00:17:18,473 --> 00:17:19,438
No.

383
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,508
Okay, good.

384
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:24,481
So the reason that I called you
was because my sort of advisor

385
00:17:24,483 --> 00:17:26,616
at the paper is always teaching me lessons,

386
00:17:26,618 --> 00:17:28,720
tricks of the trade, how to get good story,

387
00:17:28,722 --> 00:17:31,153
and one of the things
he's repeatedly telling me

388
00:17:31,155 --> 00:17:34,058
is to follow your hunch,
see where it leads.

389
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,627
Sounds like good advice.

390
00:17:35,629 --> 00:17:37,664
Yeah, it is.

391
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:41,964
Except in this instance,
that hunch involves you.

392
00:17:43,999 --> 00:17:47,569
Well, you can ask me anything, Iris.

393
00:17:47,571 --> 00:17:50,173
It's about Harrison Wells.

394
00:17:50,175 --> 00:17:51,775
What about him?

395
00:17:51,777 --> 00:17:53,376
Well, I mean, a lot of strange things

396
00:17:53,378 --> 00:17:55,847
have been happening
in Central City this past year.

397
00:17:55,849 --> 00:17:58,854
The Flash, the Burning Man
people going missing.

398
00:17:58,856 --> 00:18:00,721
He was there at Stagg's office

399
00:18:00,723 --> 00:18:03,056
the night that Stagg went missing.

400
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:10,863
And you think that Doctor Wells
is what, responsible?

401
00:18:10,865 --> 00:18:15,166
I mean, I don't really know him,
but you and your friends do.

402
00:18:17,235 --> 00:18:19,168
Uh-huh.

403
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:23,138
Barry, in your heart of hearts,
do you think it's possible

404
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,807
that there's more to Harrison

405
00:18:24,809 --> 00:18:28,344
than people have been led to believe?

406
00:18:28,346 --> 00:18:31,313
Harrison Wells is a good man.

407
00:18:31,315 --> 00:18:32,814
If you're looking for a story,

408
00:18:32,816 --> 00:18:36,050
then you're not gonna find one with him.

409
00:18:38,653 --> 00:18:40,220
I call it the Wizard's Wand.

410
00:18:40,222 --> 00:18:41,855
Subtle. How does it work?

411
00:18:41,857 --> 00:18:43,891
Think of it like an active lightning rod.

412
00:18:43,893 --> 00:18:46,226
You just point it at the sky,
and it'll suck up

413
00:18:46,228 --> 00:18:48,728
whatever energy's floating
around it like a sponge.

414
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:49,795
And it'll stop Mardon?

415
00:18:49,797 --> 00:18:51,430
It'll certainly slow him down.

416
00:18:51,432 --> 00:18:53,302
If there's no atmospheric
electrons available to him,

417
00:18:53,304 --> 00:18:54,571
there's no way for him
to control the weather.

418
00:18:54,573 --> 00:18:57,973
Good work, Cisco, as always.

419
00:18:57,975 --> 00:19:00,908
If you excuse me,
I'm gonna go stretch my legs.

420
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:08,013
You okay? You seem a little off.

421
00:19:08,015 --> 00:19:11,786
Yeah, yeah. Uh, somebody at...

422
00:19:11,788 --> 00:19:14,121
Somebody at Picture News
got it into Iris's head

423
00:19:14,123 --> 00:19:18,396
that something suspicious
is going on with Dr. Wells.

424
00:19:18,398 --> 00:19:19,832
Like what?

425
00:19:19,834 --> 00:19:22,169
That he knows what happened to Simon Stagg.

426
00:19:22,171 --> 00:19:24,372
Apparently, nobody's
heard from him or seen him

427
00:19:24,374 --> 00:19:27,009
since the night I stopped Danton Black.

428
00:19:27,011 --> 00:19:28,244
What'd you tell her?

429
00:19:28,246 --> 00:19:31,982
That she's wrong. And she is.

430
00:19:38,619 --> 00:19:40,118
(Cisco) Keep this handy.

431
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,252
I'll protect you from Mardon's powers.

432
00:19:41,254 --> 00:19:42,920
(West) Yeah, Cisco, I got it.

433
00:19:42,922 --> 00:19:46,256
Hey, Joe... I know you got
a lot going on right now,

434
00:19:46,258 --> 00:19:49,658
but... you mentioned Doctor Wells
might have had something to do

435
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,158
with Barry's mother's murder.
Why did you think that?

436
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,860
Oh, it doesn't matter. I was wrong.

437
00:19:53,862 --> 00:19:55,694
But you seemed really sure of it.

438
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:59,128
Look, Cisco, I can't talk
about this right now, okay?

439
00:19:59,964 --> 00:20:01,696
[sighs]

440
00:20:15,108 --> 00:20:18,279
I heard you were looking for me.

441
00:20:20,184 --> 00:20:21,785
Here I am.

442
00:20:27,683 --> 00:20:30,284
- Mardon.
- Hey, Joe.

443
00:20:30,286 --> 00:20:32,820
I can call you Joe, can't I?

444
00:20:32,822 --> 00:20:34,523
Figured we don't got to be too formal

445
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:37,692
seeing as you put two bullets
in my brother's chest.

446
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:39,862
Your brother killed my partner

447
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:42,064
and a whole lot of innocent people,

448
00:20:42,066 --> 00:20:44,233
and threatened to kill even more.

449
00:20:44,235 --> 00:20:45,669
[thunder rumbling]

450
00:20:45,671 --> 00:20:50,143
Yeah, Clyde was no saint,
but he was family.

451
00:20:50,145 --> 00:20:53,013
If you can't protect your family,

452
00:20:53,015 --> 00:20:55,883
the least you can do is avenge 'em.

453
00:20:55,885 --> 00:20:58,521
[thunder crashing]

454
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:01,290
This is between us.

455
00:21:01,292 --> 00:21:02,825
Nobody else needs to get hurt.

456
00:21:02,827 --> 00:21:05,561
But they are gonna get hurt.

457
00:21:08,766 --> 00:21:09,833
Joe!

458
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:11,502
No!

459
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:13,902
I'm not gonna be so easy to put down, Joe.

460
00:21:13,904 --> 00:21:15,438
Take him down!

461
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:18,410
No, run!

462
00:21:18,412 --> 00:21:21,209
Huh!

463
00:21:28,851 --> 00:21:30,254
Joe!

464
00:21:32,921 --> 00:21:34,319
[grunts]

465
00:21:38,292 --> 00:21:40,094
[wind swirling]

466
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,113
Captain!

467
00:21:56,216 --> 00:21:58,251
David.

468
00:22:07,428 --> 00:22:10,165
All right, Cisco, I'm heading home.

469
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:12,435
Cisco?

470
00:22:12,437 --> 00:22:13,836
All right, fine, I will watch

471
00:22:13,838 --> 00:22:16,773
every episode of<i> The Walking Dead</i> with you.

472
00:22:16,775 --> 00:22:19,943
Hey, you couldn't have stopped
Mardon from attacking

473
00:22:19,945 --> 00:22:23,347
the police station. It's not your fault.

474
00:22:23,349 --> 00:22:25,783
No, that's not it.

475
00:22:25,785 --> 00:22:27,752
What do you think of Dr. Wells?

476
00:22:27,754 --> 00:22:29,788
- What do you mean?
- I mean, do you think

477
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:34,555
he's capable of doing something bad?

478
00:22:34,557 --> 00:22:37,128
Is this because of what Barry
said he heard?

479
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:39,132
Ever since the particle
accelerator exploded,

480
00:22:39,134 --> 00:22:41,401
there's always someone who's
got it in for Dr. Wells.

481
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:43,771
No, no, it's more than that.
Joe said that maybe

482
00:22:43,773 --> 00:22:45,573
Dr. Wells was somehow involved

483
00:22:45,575 --> 00:22:49,213
in of Barry's Mother's death
and her murder.

484
00:22:49,215 --> 00:22:50,514
That's absurd.

485
00:22:50,516 --> 00:22:52,751
Yeah, I know, and that's what I said,

486
00:22:52,753 --> 00:22:54,521
and we proved that that wasn't the case,

487
00:22:54,523 --> 00:22:57,594
but I'm just saying,
some things aren't adding up.

488
00:22:57,596 --> 00:22:59,564
Like what, for example?

489
00:22:59,566 --> 00:23:02,000
Come here, look at this.

490
00:23:02,002 --> 00:23:03,236
The night we trapped the Reverse-Flash

491
00:23:03,238 --> 00:23:04,639
in the force-field, he escaped

492
00:23:04,641 --> 00:23:06,208
because the containment system failed,

493
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,043
but I checked that data three times,

494
00:23:08,045 --> 00:23:09,678
and the super-capacitors
were still fully charged

495
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,213
when he got out.

496
00:23:11,215 --> 00:23:12,982
The numbers don't add up, Caitlin.

497
00:23:12,984 --> 00:23:14,416
There's no reason that
the containment system

498
00:23:14,418 --> 00:23:16,116
should have failed.

499
00:23:16,118 --> 00:23:18,185
I'm sure there's
a perfectly good explanation.

500
00:23:18,187 --> 00:23:19,687
One perfectly good explanation

501
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:21,823
is that Wells did something to the trap.

502
00:23:21,825 --> 00:23:24,292
Are you suggesting
that Dr. Wells is in league

503
00:23:24,294 --> 00:23:26,058
with The Man in the Yellow Suit?

504
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:29,562
I'm... We all saw that thing
nearly kill him that night.

505
00:23:29,564 --> 00:23:32,598
Yeah, nearly.

506
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:34,065
[sighs]

507
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:35,533
Cisco, what you're saying

508
00:23:35,535 --> 00:23:38,571
doesn't make any sense. That's crazy.

509
00:23:41,738 --> 00:23:45,142
Can you keep Wells out of
S.T.A.R. Labs tomorrow morning?

510
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:57,625
- Thank you, Barry.
- Yeah.

511
00:23:57,627 --> 00:24:01,668
This isn't how I thought I'd
finally meet David's co-workers.

512
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:04,102
He speaks very highly of you.

513
00:24:04,104 --> 00:24:05,938
Really?

514
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,574
David's all bark.

515
00:24:08,576 --> 00:24:09,975
A very loud bark.

516
00:24:09,977 --> 00:24:11,508
[both chuckle]

517
00:24:13,813 --> 00:24:15,115
How is he, Doctor?

518
00:24:15,117 --> 00:24:16,884
(doctor) We're stabilizing him.

519
00:24:16,886 --> 00:24:19,254
He's experiencing some paralysis
in his lower extremities.

520
00:24:19,256 --> 00:24:20,422
Oh, my God.

521
00:24:20,424 --> 00:24:21,757
The hardest thing to gauge right now

522
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:24,396
is the extent of his
neurocognitive deficits.

523
00:24:24,398 --> 00:24:27,900
So he may not be
the same person you remember.

524
00:24:27,902 --> 00:24:29,370
Can I see him?

525
00:24:29,372 --> 00:24:33,473
I'm sorry, visitation's for family only.

526
00:24:33,475 --> 00:24:36,676
Being his fiancé makes him family, Doctor.

527
00:24:36,678 --> 00:24:38,845
Uh, sure.

528
00:24:40,714 --> 00:24:44,217
Will he be able to return to the force?

529
00:24:44,219 --> 00:24:48,317
I'm actually not sure
he'll be able to walk again.

530
00:24:53,190 --> 00:24:55,456
- Joe, where are you going?
- I need to end this.

531
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:58,560
- Not by yourself.
- Yes, by myself! I know him!

532
00:24:58,562 --> 00:25:00,028
I can find him. I don't want

533
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:03,866
anybody else getting hurt,
especially Iris and you.

534
00:25:03,868 --> 00:25:05,268
Iris is fi...

535
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,306
Mardon said he was
going to avenge his brother.

536
00:25:07,308 --> 00:25:08,842
That goes beyond me. It goes all the way

537
00:25:08,844 --> 00:25:10,477
to you and her.

538
00:25:10,479 --> 00:25:14,746
You stay with Iris, and you keep her safe.

539
00:25:14,748 --> 00:25:17,183
Do not leave her side.

540
00:25:17,185 --> 00:25:19,052
Yeah, all right.

541
00:25:33,553 --> 00:25:36,557
Hey, have you seen Iris West?

542
00:25:36,651 --> 00:25:38,084
She went to see her dad.

543
00:25:38,086 --> 00:25:39,919
- You're Barry Allen, right?
- Yeah.

544
00:25:39,987 --> 00:25:43,255
Her friend/brother?
Or is that brother/friend?

545
00:25:43,257 --> 00:25:44,490
Friend is fine.

546
00:25:44,492 --> 00:25:46,058
Oh. I'm Mason Bridge.

547
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,760
Oh, you're the guy who thinks

548
00:25:47,762 --> 00:25:49,429
Harrison Wells is some mad genius?

549
00:25:49,431 --> 00:25:51,334
Oh, no, no, no, I never said he was crazy.

550
00:25:51,336 --> 00:25:54,970
He's a sociopath and a liar, for sure.

551
00:25:54,972 --> 00:25:58,140
Really? You don't see it?

552
00:25:58,142 --> 00:25:59,910
All the time you two spend together.

553
00:25:59,912 --> 00:26:01,378
Excuse me?

554
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,784
Sometimes when I'm bored,
I follow him around.

555
00:26:03,786 --> 00:26:05,987
And for the most part, he keeps to himself,

556
00:26:05,989 --> 00:26:07,087
except when he's meeting up with you,

557
00:26:07,089 --> 00:26:08,556
which he seems to do quite a bit.

558
00:26:08,558 --> 00:26:11,461
And then one time,
he met up with Simon Stagg,

559
00:26:11,463 --> 00:26:13,562
And then poof, no more Simon Stagg.

560
00:26:13,564 --> 00:26:16,333
So you're saying Wells
knows where Stagg is?

561
00:26:16,335 --> 00:26:19,805
No, I'm saying Wells killed him.

562
00:26:19,807 --> 00:26:22,008
Ah. All right, well,

563
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:25,010
even if I believed you, which
I don't, he's in a wheelchair.

564
00:26:25,012 --> 00:26:26,814
How could he possibly have done that?

565
00:26:26,816 --> 00:26:29,048
I have evidence in a secure digital file

566
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:31,418
that will explain everything.

567
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,822
What... what evidence?

568
00:26:33,824 --> 00:26:35,458
You'll just have to read about it

569
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,760
in the Sunday paper, like everybody else.

570
00:26:45,502 --> 00:26:49,906
[machine powering on]

571
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:51,606
Let's see if you can tell me

572
00:26:51,608 --> 00:26:54,875
what really went wrong that night.

573
00:27:11,562 --> 00:27:14,760
[man yelling]

574
00:27:24,741 --> 00:27:27,643
Hey!

575
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:29,576
Joe.

576
00:27:29,578 --> 00:27:32,311
Eddie. You shouldn't be here.

577
00:27:32,313 --> 00:27:36,084
And you shouldn't be chasing
after Mardon alone, partner.

578
00:27:36,086 --> 00:27:37,752
You find anything?

579
00:27:37,754 --> 00:27:40,720
Not yet, but this was
an old Mardon brothers' hideout

580
00:27:40,722 --> 00:27:43,719
about six years ago, so it's a long shot.

581
00:27:43,721 --> 00:27:46,153
But listen, Eddie...

582
00:27:46,155 --> 00:27:49,891
Save it. I'm not leaving.

583
00:27:54,762 --> 00:27:58,198
[line ringing]

584
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,471
Hey, have you heard from Dad?
He's not answering his cell.

585
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:03,206
Uh, no.

586
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:04,571
I haven't talked to him.

587
00:28:04,573 --> 00:28:07,240
[sighs] I'm starting to worry about him.

588
00:28:07,242 --> 00:28:10,312
What are you doing home so early?

589
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:15,786
I was looking for you, actually.
I just met your friend Mason,

590
00:28:15,788 --> 00:28:19,357
and he said he had some kind of proof

591
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:21,427
that Dr. Wells did something.

592
00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:23,362
Do you know what it is?

593
00:28:23,364 --> 00:28:25,598
No, he hasn't told me.

594
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,067
All right.

595
00:28:27,069 --> 00:28:32,539
So, how are things going with Linda?

596
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:33,506
Why do you say it like that?

597
00:28:33,508 --> 00:28:34,940
Like what?

598
00:28:34,942 --> 00:28:38,178
Like how you used to always
say "Becky Cooper."

599
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,848
Oh, come on.

600
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:43,253
Becky Cooper was a nightmare
of a high school girlfriend,

601
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:44,688
and you should have never dated her.

602
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:47,084
Okay, so you're saying that
Linda is "Becky" material?

603
00:28:47,086 --> 00:28:48,753
I mean, I wouldn't go that far.

604
00:28:48,755 --> 00:28:53,461
She's... hot and nice and smart

605
00:28:53,463 --> 00:28:55,728
and she is really good at her job.

606
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,997
I just...

607
00:28:57,999 --> 00:29:00,930
I don't think that
she's the right one for you.

608
00:29:04,335 --> 00:29:06,435
Then who is?

609
00:29:20,438 --> 00:29:22,269
What?

610
00:29:22,271 --> 00:29:24,872
I don't understand.

611
00:29:24,874 --> 00:29:28,311
This doesn't make any sense.

612
00:29:28,313 --> 00:29:30,444
[machine sparking]

613
00:29:51,455 --> 00:29:54,656
Somebody was here very recently.

614
00:29:58,462 --> 00:30:01,663
He left this here for me.

615
00:30:01,665 --> 00:30:03,265
Where to next?

616
00:30:03,267 --> 00:30:06,135
[wind gust]

617
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,736
Ooh!

618
00:30:07,738 --> 00:30:09,436
Joe!

619
00:30:29,061 --> 00:30:33,295
Small miracle you only broke
the one leg, Joe.

620
00:30:33,297 --> 00:30:35,931
The night I got sucked out of my plane,

621
00:30:35,933 --> 00:30:39,104
I broke almost every bone in my body.

622
00:30:39,106 --> 00:30:40,105
[winces]

623
00:30:40,107 --> 00:30:41,940
It was excruciating.

624
00:30:41,942 --> 00:30:45,243
At least you got a small taste
of what that felt like.

625
00:30:45,245 --> 00:30:46,979
Still...

626
00:30:46,981 --> 00:30:50,151
Guess you'll never know what
it really feels like to be God.

627
00:30:50,153 --> 00:30:51,887
That's what your brother said to me,

628
00:30:51,889 --> 00:30:54,558
right before I killed him.

629
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:57,293
Aah.

630
00:30:57,295 --> 00:31:00,933
I don't need these powers to end your life.

631
00:31:00,935 --> 00:31:02,602
Then do it.

632
00:31:02,604 --> 00:31:05,269
That's what you came here for, isn't it?

633
00:31:05,271 --> 00:31:06,702
An eye for an eye?

634
00:31:06,704 --> 00:31:10,508
Oh, Joe.

635
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:13,712
I want so much more than an eye.

636
00:31:15,516 --> 00:31:17,184
(Wells) I often forget how important it is

637
00:31:17,186 --> 00:31:18,819
to step away from my ever present routine.

638
00:31:18,821 --> 00:31:20,385
Thank you, Caitlin.

639
00:31:20,387 --> 00:31:22,687
This morning has been
a refreshing change of pace.

640
00:31:22,689 --> 00:31:24,825
You can have more than two hard-boiled eggs

641
00:31:24,827 --> 00:31:27,062
for breakfast, Dr. Wells.

642
00:31:27,064 --> 00:31:29,196
What can I say?
I guess I'm a creature of habit.

643
00:31:29,198 --> 00:31:30,966
Oh, I'm sorry, I believe these were to-go.

644
00:31:30,968 --> 00:31:34,404
Actually, I thought we could
sit here and enjoy them.

645
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:40,777
Why not?

646
00:31:40,779 --> 00:31:44,578
We've seen what Mardon can do,
but do not forget,

647
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,314
he is not invincible.

648
00:31:46,316 --> 00:31:47,783
I can't believe this is happening.

649
00:31:47,785 --> 00:31:49,586
(Thawne) He is still a
man, at best, a criminal.

650
00:31:49,588 --> 00:31:51,087
We'll find him.

651
00:31:51,089 --> 00:31:52,122
(Thawne) We will find this dirt bag...

652
00:31:52,124 --> 00:31:55,361
Hey, look at me, all right?

653
00:31:55,363 --> 00:31:57,999
I promise I will bring him back to you.

654
00:31:58,001 --> 00:31:59,031
(Thawne) Whatever you need to do...

655
00:31:59,033 --> 00:32:00,597
Okay.

656
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:04,734
I want you all to scour
this city until we find Joe.

657
00:32:07,405 --> 00:32:09,172
Move out!

658
00:32:09,174 --> 00:32:13,743
[phone vibrating]

659
00:32:13,745 --> 00:32:14,979
Hello?

660
00:32:14,981 --> 00:32:17,581
(Mark) I have your father.

661
00:32:17,583 --> 00:32:20,653
He's a little broken, but still alive.

662
00:32:20,655 --> 00:32:22,757
If you want him to stay that way,

663
00:32:22,759 --> 00:32:25,627
come to the waterfront, south side.

664
00:32:25,629 --> 00:32:28,429
Oh, and Iris, you tell the police,

665
00:32:28,431 --> 00:32:30,764
your father's dead.

666
00:32:32,934 --> 00:32:36,070
She's on her way.

667
00:32:39,108 --> 00:32:42,443
He has my dad.

668
00:32:42,445 --> 00:32:44,113
He says if I tell anyone, he'll kill him.

669
00:32:44,115 --> 00:32:45,749
He wants me to meet him at the waterfront.

670
00:32:45,751 --> 00:32:46,984
All right, I'm coming with you.

671
00:32:46,986 --> 00:32:48,152
Okay.

672
00:32:48,154 --> 00:32:49,587
Let's go.

673
00:32:51,256 --> 00:32:52,489
- Barry.
- Hey.

674
00:32:52,491 --> 00:32:54,190
Can I talk to you for a second?

675
00:32:54,192 --> 00:32:56,559
No, Linda, I'm sorry,
I really can't right now.

676
00:32:56,561 --> 00:32:58,195
Of course not.

677
00:32:58,197 --> 00:33:00,097
Look, it's not like
that. It's an emergency.

678
00:33:00,099 --> 00:33:02,268
I have to go right now.

679
00:33:05,205 --> 00:33:09,040
You know, Dr. Wells, I just...

680
00:33:09,042 --> 00:33:11,244
I want to thank you again

681
00:33:11,246 --> 00:33:13,982
for all that you've done for Ronnie.

682
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:16,451
One thank you will suffice, I'm sure.

683
00:33:23,726 --> 00:33:28,263
You know, Caitlin, if Cisco were to adjust

684
00:33:28,265 --> 00:33:32,231
the radial velocity parameters
on the S.T.A.R Labs satellite,

685
00:33:32,233 --> 00:33:33,767
we might be able to better detect

686
00:33:33,769 --> 00:33:36,003
the vortex of a forming storm,
and if we could detect

687
00:33:36,005 --> 00:33:38,273
those air updrafts,
no matter where they originate,

688
00:33:38,275 --> 00:33:43,110
no matter how small, we might
be able to locate Mark Mardon.

689
00:33:43,112 --> 00:33:45,478
That's a great idea.

690
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,812
So why don't we go to S.T.A.R. Labs

691
00:33:46,814 --> 00:33:49,647
and alert Cisco?

692
00:33:49,649 --> 00:33:52,482
Let me just get these to-go.

693
00:33:59,122 --> 00:34:02,259
Hi, could I get these in to-go cups?

694
00:34:02,261 --> 00:34:04,162
Sure, just a second.

695
00:34:12,935 --> 00:34:16,170
[distorted voice] My goals are
beyond your understanding.

696
00:34:17,005 --> 00:34:18,540
[typing clacks]

697
00:34:18,542 --> 00:34:23,048
[speaking backwards]

698
00:34:24,783 --> 00:34:28,154
Dr. Wells, we meet at last.

699
00:34:28,156 --> 00:34:31,392
My goals are beyond your understanding.

700
00:34:31,394 --> 00:34:33,293
I can't believe this.

701
00:34:33,295 --> 00:34:37,029
Oh, I'm not like The Flash at all.

702
00:34:37,031 --> 00:34:40,667
Some would say, I'm the Reverse.

703
00:34:45,408 --> 00:34:49,145
Congratulations, Joe.
You're my plus-one today.

704
00:34:49,147 --> 00:34:50,981
Front row seats to watch everyone

705
00:34:50,983 --> 00:34:54,584
and everything you ever loved, destroyed.

706
00:34:56,387 --> 00:34:59,691
Pretty girl too.

707
00:34:59,693 --> 00:35:02,159
Such a shame.

708
00:35:02,161 --> 00:35:03,660
Please, she's my daughter.

709
00:35:03,662 --> 00:35:05,164
Clyde was my brother.

710
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:07,401
He's a thief and a murderer.

711
00:35:07,403 --> 00:35:09,169
She's an innocent girl.

712
00:35:09,171 --> 00:35:11,004
She'll pay for the sins of the father then.

713
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:15,407
They'll all pay.

714
00:35:15,409 --> 00:35:18,613
[thunder rumbling]

715
00:35:21,154 --> 00:35:22,956
[clapping]

716
00:35:22,958 --> 00:35:25,856
You're incredibly clever, Cisco.

717
00:35:25,858 --> 00:35:28,492
I've always said so.

718
00:35:28,494 --> 00:35:31,558
You're him.

719
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,494
The Reverse-Flash.

720
00:35:33,496 --> 00:35:37,200
You and I have never been
truly, properly introduced.

721
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:42,102
I am Eobard Thawne.

722
00:35:42,104 --> 00:35:45,272
Thawne?

723
00:35:45,274 --> 00:35:47,074
Like Eddie.

724
00:35:47,076 --> 00:35:51,378
Let's call him a distant relative.

725
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:55,748
The night that we trapped
the Reverse-Flash,

726
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:56,748
you almost died.

727
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,083
Mm-hmm.

728
00:35:58,085 --> 00:35:59,986
There were two of you.

729
00:36:11,468 --> 00:36:13,502
It's an after-image,

730
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:17,109
A speed mirage, if you will.

731
00:36:19,614 --> 00:36:22,149
[panicked breathing]

732
00:36:22,151 --> 00:36:25,219
Joe was right.

733
00:36:25,221 --> 00:36:30,720
You were there that night,
15 years ago, in Barry's house.

734
00:36:32,494 --> 00:36:34,728
You killed Nora Allen.

735
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:38,731
It was never my intention to kill Nora.

736
00:36:38,733 --> 00:36:43,266
I was there to kill Barry.

737
00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:45,300
Why?

738
00:36:45,302 --> 00:36:47,203
You're his friend.

739
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:48,671
You've been teaching him how to...

740
00:36:48,673 --> 00:36:53,208
Go faster, I know. A means to an end.

741
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,077
And I'll tell you why.

742
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:59,214
Because I have been stuck here,

743
00:36:59,216 --> 00:37:05,215
marooned here in this place
for 15 long years.

744
00:37:05,956 --> 00:37:10,161
And The Flash and The Flash's speed

745
00:37:10,163 --> 00:37:15,215
is the key to my returning to my world.

746
00:37:17,204 --> 00:37:20,471
To my time.

747
00:37:20,473 --> 00:37:25,713
And no one is going to prevent
that from happening.

748
00:37:29,016 --> 00:37:31,586
I can help you.

749
00:37:31,588 --> 00:37:36,421
You're smart, Cisco.

750
00:37:36,423 --> 00:37:38,591
But you're not that smart.

751
00:37:40,529 --> 00:37:43,030
Do you know

752
00:37:43,032 --> 00:37:47,770
how hard it has been
to keep all of this from you,

753
00:37:47,772 --> 00:37:53,243
especially from you? Because the truth is,

754
00:37:53,245 --> 00:37:56,744
I've grown quite fond of you.

755
00:37:56,746 --> 00:38:01,550
And in many ways, you have shown me

756
00:38:01,552 --> 00:38:04,215
what it's like to have a son.

757
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:14,425
Forgive me, but to me,
you've been dead for centuries.

758
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:34,176
What do we do?

759
00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:36,213
He'll find us.

760
00:38:36,215 --> 00:38:38,751
Oh, my God.

761
00:38:38,753 --> 00:38:41,753
[thunder rumbling]

762
00:38:41,755 --> 00:38:43,287
Iris, you need to get out of here, okay?

763
00:38:43,289 --> 00:38:44,722
You need to get as far away
from here as possible.

764
00:38:44,724 --> 00:38:46,258
- I am not leaving you.
- Iris, please!

765
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,425
Listen to me, ever since the night

766
00:38:47,427 --> 00:38:48,925
that you told me how you felt,

767
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:51,059
I have not been able to
stop thinking about you.

768
00:38:51,061 --> 00:38:53,829
At first, I was really mad,

769
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,564
and then I realized that
the reason that I couldn't

770
00:38:55,566 --> 00:39:00,235
stop thinking about you
was because I didn't want to.

771
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:04,405
I've never stopped thinking about you.

772
00:39:24,225 --> 00:39:26,960
[thunder rumbling]

773
00:39:26,962 --> 00:39:30,163
Aah!

774
00:39:36,203 --> 00:39:37,904
Caitlin.

775
00:39:37,906 --> 00:39:39,871
Barry, I need to talk to you.
Dr. Wells, he isn't...

776
00:39:39,873 --> 00:39:41,773
(Barry) Hey, there's no time
for that right now, all right?

777
00:39:41,775 --> 00:39:44,778
There is a tsunami heading for the city.

778
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,445
(Barry) How do I stop it?

779
00:39:46,447 --> 00:39:49,615
Theoretically, if you can
create a vortex barrier

780
00:39:49,617 --> 00:39:51,353
along the coastline, a wall of wind,

781
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:53,957
that would be able to sap
the tidal wave of its energy

782
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:55,191
before it hits the city.

783
00:39:55,193 --> 00:39:57,860
By running back and forth. How fast?

784
00:39:57,862 --> 00:40:00,162
I don't know if you can run that fast.

785
00:40:02,097 --> 00:40:03,497
(Barry) I am so sorry.

786
00:40:03,499 --> 00:40:06,735
I didn't want you to find out this way.

787
00:40:10,108 --> 00:40:11,910
Go!

788
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:27,096
[roaring]

789
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:50,026
Aah!

790
00:40:53,930 --> 00:40:57,131
[people screaming]

791
00:41:03,407 --> 00:41:06,845
Aah!

792
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:22,390
[panting]

793
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:31,690
Taxi! Taxi!

794
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,690
Oh come on, I'm gonna be late!

795
00:41:35,490 --> 00:41:37,090
Oh boy.
