That guy had a chance to move off

167
00:06:57,182 --> 00:06:58,615
and fire three shots into the window

168
00:06:58,617 --> 00:06:59,950
trying to break the glass.

169
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:02,118
But they all started in the same spot,

170
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,320
which means they should have
all been affected by the gas

171
00:07:04,322 --> 00:07:06,123
at the same time, but instead,
it's as if...

172
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,892
They were attacked one by one.

173
00:07:08,894 --> 00:07:12,359
My gut feeling,
if we're gonna solve this one,

174
00:07:12,361 --> 00:07:14,094
you and me are gonna need...

175
00:07:14,096 --> 00:07:17,597
- Backup.
- Yeah.

176
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,300
Fascinating, a meta-human
that can manipulate poison gas.

177
00:07:20,302 --> 00:07:21,669
Is it just poisonous gas,

178
00:07:21,671 --> 00:07:23,337
or can he control all aerated substances?

179
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:25,472
And how is he able
to formulate the connection?

180
00:07:25,474 --> 00:07:27,441
Is it physiological or psychological?

181
00:07:27,443 --> 00:07:28,808
This individual can create

182
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,476
a mental nexus using gaseous substances.

183
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:32,478
You mean connect with gases
on a molecular level?

184
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,979
- Yes.
- That is ridiculously cool.

185
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:35,715
They get really excited about this stuff.

186
00:07:35,717 --> 00:07:37,016
The only thing I'm excited about

187
00:07:37,018 --> 00:07:38,819
is putting criminals behind bars.

188
00:07:38,821 --> 00:07:41,489
Except Iron Heights isn't exactly equipped

189
00:07:41,491 --> 00:07:43,025
to handle meta-humans.

190
00:07:43,027 --> 00:07:44,661
Then I guess it's fortunate the ones

every super criminal we stop,

194
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:52,041
you geniuses are gonna have to come up

195
00:07:52,043 --> 00:07:53,942
with someplace else to hold them.

196
00:07:53,944 --> 00:07:56,911
A meta-human prison. Sweet.

197
00:07:56,913 --> 00:07:59,681
Until we figure a way
to remove their powers.

198
00:07:59,683 --> 00:08:04,352
There is one place here
that might hold them.

199
00:08:04,354 --> 00:08:05,751
You can't be serious.

200

Cisco is right.

203
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:11,789
It could be modified to act

204
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:12,956
as a makeshift prison.

The work my team and I will do here

209
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,076
will change our understanding of physics,

210
00:08:29,078 --> 00:08:31,312
will bring about advancements in power,

211

advancements in medicine.

212
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:35,347

Yes, but Italy doesn't have Mai Tais,

my dad about us,

539
00:24:38,845 --> 00:24:40,611
then it would make this real,

540
00:24:40,613 --> 00:24:43,478

that I could lose
