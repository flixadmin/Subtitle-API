1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,280
<i>In 2166, an immortal tyrant
named Vandal Savage</i>

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,920
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,640
<i>I have assembled an elite team
to hunt him throughout time</i>

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,320
<i>and stop his rise to power.</i>

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,240
<i>Unfortunately, my plan is opposed</i>

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,960
<i>by the body I'd sworn
my allegiance to, the Time Masters.</i>

7
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:19,240
<i>In the future,
my friends may not be heroes.</i>

8
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,080
<i>But if we succeed,
they will be remembered as legends.</i>

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,160
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,240
I'm a Time Master.

11
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,680
Making discrete alterations
to the timeline is what I do.

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,480
Half of what you told us about
the mission turned out to be lies.

13
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,200
Lewis Snart, convicted of larceny,
armed robbery.

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,120
You and your entire family
are criminals.

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,840
Things are complicated with family.

16
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,480
The Lazarus Pit brought me back

17
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:49,160
but it left me with this
need to kill.

18
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,080
You're Princess Chay-Ara,
I'm Prince Khufu, and we're lovers.

19
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,360
I know you're worth the wait.

20
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,440
Aah!

21
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,360
Well, I say we kick Savage's ass
for Carter.

22
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,480
For Carter.

23
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,680
Who are you?

24
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,800
The man who's here to kill you.

25
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,560
{\an5}<i>We've arrived in Leipzig, Germany,</i>

26
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,760
<i>the most current location
for Vandal Savage.</i>

27
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,880
<i>And by the way, Captain,</i>

28
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,600
<i>you are urgently needed
in the MedBay.</i>

29
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,640
I thought she'd stabilized.

30
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,720
As did I.

31
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,480
Carter! Where's Carter?

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,240
He's gone, Kendra. I'm so sorry.

33
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,600
Gideon, turn that bloody noise off!

34
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,840
<i>- Yes, Captain.</i>
- What happened?

35
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,520
Saunders appears to have had
a complication.

36
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,400
Are you...
I know, what kind of complication?

37
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,000
How could you leave him?

38
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,160
- Is she...
- MedBay gave her a sedative.

39
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,160
But obviously, her condition
is worsening.

40
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,480
Pieces of the dagger have
apparently broken off

41
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,360
and are... as we speak,
en route to her heart.

42
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,040
{\an5}Can't we just time jump
into the future

43
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,480
{\an5}where they got the stuff
that can fix her?

44
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,160
{\an5}This ship is from
that very same future

45
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,520
{\an5}and has, thus far, been unsuccessful
in saving her.

46
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,320
Kendra wouldn't survive
the time jump anyway.

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,120
I pay attention.

48
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,880
{\an5}To sum up, Carter Hall is dead,
the girlfriend's not too far behind.

49
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:54,640
{\an5}Vandal Savage is sitting pretty in
1975, which we're all now stuck in.

50
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,040
That how the plan supposed
to work, Rip?

51
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,520
{\an5}Obviously not.
But the mission is simple.

52
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,560
{\an5}We... we stop Vandal Savage here
in the past...

53
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,200
and we save the future.

54
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,680
Simple don't mean easy, Captain.

55
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,320
{\an5}Oh, I never said it was.

56
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,800
{\an5}The benefit of being
a Time Master is that

57
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,520
{\an5}the length and breadth of history
gives one perspective.

58
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,840
{\an5}I've seen darker days.

59
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,800
I've seen men of steel die
and dark knights fall.

60
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,400
And even then, I accomplished
my mission no matter what.

61
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,200
Gideon, what is our status?

62
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,160
{\an5}<i>When the</i>Waverider <i>was attacked
by Chronos,</i>

63
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,920
{\an5}<i>the Jumpship was damaged.</i>

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,800
<i>Unless you make repairs,
we will be unable to...</i>

65
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,360
Wait, wait. <i>Jumpship?</i>

66
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,400
It's a small expeditionary vessel
at the belly of the <i>Waverider</i>...

67
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,480
you're a mechanic!

68
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,640
{\an5}You have a look at it.

69
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,840
{\an5}Auto mechanic.

70
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,160
Uh... spaceship.

71
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,880
{\an5}Okay, if you've got a set
of wrenches,

72
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,040
I'll see what I can do.

73
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,080
What about the rest of us?
Do we just sit?

74
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,320
Capital idea, Mr. Rory.

75
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,280
You're not nearly as thick
as most people say.

76
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,480
Thick...

77
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,800
does that mean stupid?

78
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,800
{\an5}Is that your son? He looks like you.

79
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,840
{\an5}Sorry.

80
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,120
{\an5}Trained by League of Assassins,

81
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,480
sneaking up on people
is kind of our thing.

82
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,200
I'd like to be alone for a moment.

83
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,320
{\an5}You don't actually have a plan,
do you?

84
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,520
{\an5}And that speech wasn't about
convincing us.

85
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,200
{\an5}It was about convincing you.
Didn't work, did it?

86
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,520
{\an5}Not particularly, no.
Hence my desire to be alone.

87
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,240
So we can't kill Savage.

88
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,120
Oh, I see you've grasped the concept
of immortality. Well done.

89
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,000
{\an5}Maybe we could slow him down.

90
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,480
{\an5}Now, Ra's al Ghul taught me
a thing or two

91
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,920
{\an5}about fighting powerful adversaries.

92
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,160
{\an5}If you can't kill your enemy,
weaken him.

93
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,920
{\an5}If you can't cut off his head...

94
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,440
take his heart.

95
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,600
Mr. al Ghul was quite the poet.

96
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,400
{\an5}Back at the weapons auction,
Savage was trying to sell his nuke.

97
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,600
Money is power.

98
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,040
{\an5}Take away Savage's fortune

99
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,360
{\an5}and he's just a regular guy
with a really long lifespan.

100
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,880
It certainly would set his plan for
world domination back a few decades.

101
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:12,320
{\an5}So, where does Vandal Savage
keep his money in 1975?

102
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,960
{\an5}The broken knife fragments are moving
through her circulatory system.

103
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,000
{\an5}And if you'll notice these,
they're closing in towards her heart.

104
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,600
So what do we do?

105
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,800
{\an5}The fragments are miniscule.

106
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,000
{\an5}Even the ship's technology
isn't capable of neutralizing them.

107
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,360
{\an5}Fortunately,
there's a technology onboard that is.

108
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,040
The atom suit.

109
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,040
{\an5}I can shrink down,
slip into her bloodstream

110
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,320
{\an5}and use the photon canons
to vaporize the knife fragments.

111
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,560
{\an5}You'll be pushing the suit's limits.

112
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,120
{\an5}We should run some tests, make sure
this is the best plan of action.

113
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,320
This isn't the ivory tower,
Professor.

114
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,600
- We don't have time...
- Listen to me, Raymond.

115
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,480
- I'm not your student anymore.
- You were never my student!

116
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,640
Just because you don't remember me.

117
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,280
If... if you had been my student,

118
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,320
I'd have taught you the principles
of using scientific analysis,

119
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,040
not this bravado.

120
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,360
There isn't time. I'm going in.

121
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,720
Gideon! Where's Savage's money now?

122
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,880
<i>Dr. Boardman theorized that Savage
entrusted it to the Bruemberg Group,</i>

123
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,600
<i>the oldest bank in the world.</i>

124
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,760
I'll go tell the rest of the team.

125
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:06,920
That won't be necessary.

126
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,360
I'm going alone.

127
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,200
I can't have any more blood
on my hands.

128
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,520
Except for your own?

129
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,960
You can't go in there without backup.

130
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:19,640
Look, I brought you all with me
under false pretenses.

131
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,360
Carter would still be alive

132
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,880
if I hadn't have convinced him
to come.

133
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,760
No one's on this ship that doesn't
want to be here.

134
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,920
But I can't risk the whole team.

135
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,600
Fine. Just me.

136
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,880
And if it helps,
I'm not giving you a choice.

137
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,440
I'm going with you to that bank.

138
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,520
Somebody say bank?

139
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,160
Your services aren't required,
Mr. Snart.

140
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,760
This is purely reconnaissance.

141
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,840
We know how to case banks.

142
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,280
We're practically bankers.

143
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,680
Except we take the money out.

144
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,840
Yes, and when I need someone
to steal something,

145
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,760
you'll be the first to know,
I assure you.

146
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,040
Listen, Englishman.

147
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,560
I'm getting bored being stuck
on this tin can.

148
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,680
And when I get bored,
I make bad decisions.

149
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,760
Now, now, now.
We're all on the same side here.

150
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,000
My hot-headed friend
and I just want to be helpful.

151
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,320
That's all.

152
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,440
Duly noted.

153
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,840
You should have let me punch him.

154
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,320
Yeah, then we wouldn't
have gotten this.

155
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,920
You ready?

156
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,520
Yes.

157
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,840
All right, where am I headed?

158
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,760
You're exiting the tracheal artery.
You should see the first fragment.

159
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,640
<i>No sign of it. Did I miss it?</i>

160
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,840
It's the size of an iceberg.

161
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,880
It seems highly unlikely
that you could miss it.

162
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,800
That's probably what they said
on the <i>Titanic</i>.

163
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,120
Think I found it.

164
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,280
Looks like all those years of playing
Asteroids is about to pay off.

165
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,640
Her vitals are improving.
It seems to be working.

166
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,560
There's still 19 more fragments.

167
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,640
<i>Raymond?</i>

168
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,720
<i>Raymond, you're... you're not done!</i>

169
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,800
I'm losing core containment.

170
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,800
Plot me a course out of here. Now!

171
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,040
<i>Hey</i>

172
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,120
<i>Time is truly wasting</i>

173
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,760
<i>There's no guarantee</i>

174
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,480
<i>Smile is in the making</i>

175
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,560
Excuse me.

176
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,360
We'd like to deposit some family
heirlooms.

177
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,160
I'm sorry, we're a private bank.

178
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,160
We don't secure valuables worth less
than ten million dollars.

179
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,680
Well, I'm sure this will suffice.

180
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,160
Doubloons from the wreck
of the <i>Esplinade</i>.

181
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,160
They've been appraised
at ten million dollars...

182
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,720
apiece.

183
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,040
<i>Fight the power</i>

184
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,040
<i>Fight it</i>

185
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,320
Such a pleasure.

186
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,240
You won't regret your decision.

187
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,880
The Bruemberg Group is known
for its discretion.

188
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,800
I'm sure there'll be a fair deal
of paperwork to sign.

189
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,880
Not too much.

190
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,560
We like to cut through
the red tape here.

191
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,200
Let me get this to one of our safe
deposit boxes

192
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,560
and I'll get my secretary to move
in on this paperwork.

193
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,480
Interesting.

194
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,960
There are records here referring
to something called the <i>Vessel</i>.

195
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,520
We have a problem.

196
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,280
Yes, I know, none of Savage's funds
are in this bank.

197
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,040
I'm working on locating this <i>Vessel</i>,

198
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,560
but I'm not sure I'll do so
before our new friend returns.

199
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,680
To kill us.

200
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,560
The receptionist had a silenced
Beretta under her desk.

201
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,480
The guards,
South African mercenaries.

202
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,760
You can tell by the initiation burns
on their neck.

203
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,320
And our new friend here
has calluses on his right hand

204
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,680
consistent with being
Kuroda-trained swordsmen.

205
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,200
- How do you know?
- Because I have the same calluses.

206
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,400
Which means they've probably figured
out that we are not Rockefellers

207
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,840
who just came into their inheritance.

208
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,080
Oh, don't be so alarmist.

209
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,200
Calluses are hardly definitive proof
of anything. But there's...

210
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,680
Pretty sure they made us.

211
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,640
Well, if this is how you treat
your customers,

212
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,040
we might just have to take our
business elsewhere.

213
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:26,240
I thought I specifically said
no weapons!

214
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,680
You can thank me later.

215
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,240
<i>If you're looking for someone</i>

216
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,880
<i>That you can keep</i>

217
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,120
Exactly how many knives do you have?

218
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,720
Seems you brought a knife
to a swordfight.

219
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,080
<i>And if you want something</i>

220
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,080
<i>That's 20 years deep</i>

221
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,640
<i>Baby don't even try</i>

222
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,320
<i>Maybe lift you a little bit higher</i>

223
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,240
<i>I got the fire!</i>

224
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,680
Sara.

225
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,840
Sara! Sara, don't!

226
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,280
We didn't get anything
from the computer!

227
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,520
We need him alive!

228
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,120
What the hell happened back there?

229
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,280
You know I'm a killer.

230
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,920
That's why you put me
in your little group.

231
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,880
I didn't witness just a killer
at work, Sara.

232
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,360
What I saw was an animal.

233
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,200
You are the last person on this ship
to judge anyone!

234
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,440
This is not judgment, Sara.
It is concern.

235
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,680
I thought you knew
how I was resurrected and...

236
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,840
and what it did to me.

237
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,840
I know you were restored
by something called the Lazarus Pit.

238
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,680
Well, apparently, there's a downside
to being brought back to life.

239
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,880
My friend Thea calls it a bloodlust.

240
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:09,440
And I think that's being too generous
and so is calling me an animal.

241
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,800
I'm a monster.

242
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,960
Ha! Nice ride!

243
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,480
Yeah. It can hit a Mach 3in a walk.
Pretty cool.

244
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,960
How'd you know so much about it?

245
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,760
Little thing called an instruction
manual.

246
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,040
Did you read the part about
how to fly this thing?

247
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,800
Maybe... Why?

248
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,080
We're gonna take a little sojourn
to Central City.

249
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,640
There's a priceless jewel that needs
to be freed from captivity.

250
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,640
You want me to help you steal
something?

251
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,120
No, man. I'll pass.

252
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,080
Not exactly asking, Jax.

253
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,520
Wow. Carter is dead.

254
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,200
Kendra is this close to joining him

255
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,840
and Vandal Savage is still alive
and out there doing God knows what.

256
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:55,000
And all you can think about
is stealing some diamond?

257
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,320
It's an emerald.

258
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,480
Is there anything you think about
other than yourself?

259
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,320
Yes. Money.

260
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,760
No. I'm not helping you guys steal
anything.

261
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,760
So if you want to shoot me,
then shoot me.

262
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,840
Can I shoot him?

263
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,200
You got a pair on you, kid.
I respect that.

264
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,760
So no shooting.

265
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,720
Look, you don't actually have
to help us steal anything.

266
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,480
We just need to get to Central City.

267
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,320
We'll be there and back before
anyone knows we're even gone.

268
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,560
Man, even if I wanted to help,
and I'm not saying that I do,

269
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,440
this thing's got a security lockout.

270
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,000
We need an access key.

271
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,080
You can't tell me you don't wanna see
what this baby can do.

272
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,240
I believe I've determined a way
to more efficiently track

273
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,360
the fragments still inside
Miss Saunders body.

274
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,240
Next time you'll be better prepared.

275
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,600
There won't be a next time.

276
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,880
Can't you fix the suit?

277
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,000
It's not the suit.

278
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,400
Raymond, you...
you mustn't be discouraged.

279
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,480
We're scientists.

280
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,840
We learn from failure,
and we keep going.

281
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,920
Kendra isn't a lab experiment.
She's a person.

282
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I know.

283
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,800
You need to have confidence
this will work.

284
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:06,520
Well, I don't. I can't save her.

285
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,080
Based on what evidence?

286
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,800
Are we not empirical thinkers,
Dr. Palmer?

287
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,640
Exactly how many people
have you lost?

288
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,440
One.

289
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,000
Who did you lose?

290
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,520
Someone close to you?

291
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,600
Who was she, Raymond?

292
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,320
For someone who doesn't remember me,

293
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,760
you sure have a lot of personal
observations to offer.

294
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,280
Fine.

295
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,760
Don't talk to me, but fix the suit.

296
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,320
It's the only chance
that poor girl has.

297
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,840
I'm gonna make this very simple
for you, Mr. Blake.

298
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,480
You tell me where Vandal Savage
is hiding his fortune

299
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,760
and we will let you leave
here unmolested.

300
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,840
Vandal Savage...

301
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,680
is that the name you know him by?

302
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,760
Let's assume so, yes.

303
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,320
And what is your name?

304
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,640
Gareeb?

305
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,640
- Will you give us a moment?
- Gareeb?

306
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,120
It's a legend passed down
for 4,000 years.

307
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,520
When my master was first
bestowed the gift of eternal life,

308
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,280
an enemy tried to kill him.

309
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,440
Every myth has its monster,
it's devil.

310
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,400
For those of our order,
it's him, the Gareeb.

311
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,640
I'd stop talking now if I were you,
mate.

312
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,680
If I were you, I'd run.

313
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,760
Your friend has already failed
to kill my master once.

314
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,440
He won't be able to protect you.

315
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,680
In fact, I highly doubt he's ever
been able to protect anyone.

316
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,280
What did he mean
you already tried to kill Savage?

317
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,480
Leave it be, Sara.

318
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,760
- No, if you want us to do this...
- Yes, okay!

319
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,840
Yes, I... I had the chance
to kill Savage once before.

320
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,720
I had him dead to rights
and I hesitated.

321
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,440
Get off me! Aah!

322
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,360
I asked you a question.

323
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,080
Who are you, Gareeb?

324
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:36,240
Killing is never easy,
especially for a good man.

325
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,680
But the man killed my wife and son

326
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,360
and God knows how many
other wives and sons,

327
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,640
and yet I couldn't...

328
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,840
Your killing people doesn't make you
a monster, Sara,

329
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,920
but having the chance to avenge your
family and not taking it...

330
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,040
that does.

331
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,080
Let's try this again.

332
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,440
Back for more.

333
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,160
Where's Savage's fortune?

334
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,840
Now, I'm particularly interested
in this thing called the Vessel.

335
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:36,480
The Vessel is my master's most
treasured possession.

336
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,160
Excellent, and where can we find it?

337
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,320
The Greyhill Building.

338
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,520
There's a gathering tonight
in celebration of it.

339
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,840
And clearly you want us to go
so we can get ourselves killed.

340
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,040
Clearly.

341
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,320
What is the Vessel?

342
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,400
It's the remains of Prince Khufu
of the Middle Kingdom.

343
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,000
I believe you know him
as Carter Hall.

344
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,240
What is Savage going to do
with Carter's body?

345
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,760
Well, there's only one way
to find out, isn't there?

346
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,880
Gideon, locate the Greyhill Building
and set a course.

347
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,880
Wait. We have a plan.
Going after Savage's fortune.

348
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,000
Yeah, well, not anymore!

349
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,040
I won't let Carter's remains be
desecrated by that monster.

350
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,480
I won't let him win again.

351
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,840
And when Kendra wakes up,
and she will wake up...

352
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,560
she can give her soul mate
a proper farewell.

353
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,720
Then let us at least go in
with the rest of the team.

354
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,640
Gideon!

355
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,240
<i>Sir, Mr. Snart, Mr. Rory,
and Mr. Jackson</i>

356
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,720
<i>are no longer aboard the ship.</i>

357
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,320
That's what I call a clean heist.

358
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,200
And thanks for not setting
the museum on fire, partner.

359
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:39,160
And you, thanks for
being our getaway driver.

360
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,280
Speaking of,
let's get the hell back to the ship.

361
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,760
Oh, one more stop.

362
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,400
What are you talking about, boss?

363
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,720
1629 Handley Avenue.

364
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,080
What's on Handley Avenue?

365
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,360
It's where we grew up.

366
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,920
That's why you wanted to steal
the Maximilian Emerald.

367
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,120
Mick, enough.

368
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,320
You wanted to give it to your old man

369
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,040
so he wouldn't go to jail
trying to steal it for himself.

370
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,920
Your father was a thief too?

371
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,040
And unfortunately,
not a very good one.

372
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,520
Didn't Rip say something about not
messing with the timeline?

373
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,240
You could accidentally blink yourself
out of existence.

374
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,480
You're screwing with history here,
man.

375
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,520
Yeah, well, history screwed
with me first.

376
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,480
I know how it feels.

377
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,960
What?

378
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,600
To have a crisis of confidence.

379
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,760
As unlikely as that might seem,
I know.

380
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,360
It was 2002. I was teaching
quantum mechanics

381
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,800
and I had one particularly gifted
student.

382
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,800
He was able to solve
the Ehrenfest Theorem

383
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,840
in less than an hour.

384
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,880
He was quite frankly the only student
in all my years of teaching

385
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,800
who ever made me feel inferior.

386
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,120
That student...

387
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,640
was you.

388
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,240
You were... exceptional.

389
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,000
And suddenly, just like that,
you remember having me in your class.

390
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,080
I always remembered.

391
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,560
I just enjoyed taking you down
a peg or two.

392
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,520
And why tell me now?

393
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,840
Because I cannot for the life
of me reconcile that...

394
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,280
cocksure student I remember
with a man

395
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,480
who believes he doesn't have what
it takes to save Miss Saunders' life.

396
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,280
Who did you lose, Raymond?

397
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,400
My fiancée, Anna Loring.

398
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,560
She was killed two years ago
in a Starling City siege.

399
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,680
Right in front of me.

400
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,320
I couldn't have stopped them.
I couldn't do anything.

401
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,800
My leg had been broken.
I couldn't get to her.

402
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,600
I could only watch...

403
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,320
as they broke her neck.

404
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,080
I built this suit because
I promised myself that night

405
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,440
that I would never be powerless
to save anyone again.

406
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,560
So when a fragment broke free
and damaged my suit, I...

407
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,760
panicked.

408
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,880
Froze.

409
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,480
Raymond, you couldn't save Anna...

410
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,360
but you can save Kendra.

411
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,760
I believe it.

412
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,840
I believe in that student.

413
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,600
I just need him to believe it, too.

414
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,880
Let's do it.

415
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,720
Ah, Mr. Blake. Welcome.

416
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,240
I take it Mrs. Blake is out of town?

417
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,840
That's a very pointed observation.

418
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,920
If you're going to find the vessel,
you'll need my help.

419
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,400
No, I think we're quite good
without it.

420
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,360
Sara?

421
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,800
I came down for a glass of water.

422
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,760
I'm Leo.

423
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,640
Are you friends with my daddy?

424
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,640
Kind of.

425
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,960
I think my daddy's sleeping.

426
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,360
Can I tell you something, Leo?

427
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,760
It's important.

428
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,800
Don't ever let anyone hurt you.

429
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,880
Ever.

430
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,360
Not here...

431
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,760
and especially...

432
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:20,960
not here.

433
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,680
No matter what, you always have
to look out for yourself.

434
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,760
Okay?

435
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,320
You understand?

436
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,760
I think so.

437
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,320
You get the hell away from my boy,
you son of a bitch.

438
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,840
Why don't you go on up to bed?

439
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,760
Go on.

440
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,400
Talk fast, or you take a bullet.

441
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,600
What are you doing in my home?

442
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,080
A favor for you.

443
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,560
Watch it.

444
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,320
Relax.

445
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,440
How the hell did you get...

446
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,520
Two days from now, you try
to steal this and you get arrested

447
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,000
and you spend five years
in Iron Heights.

448
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,680
What are you talking about?

449
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,000
Cut the crap.

450
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,160
We both know if I go down
to the basement right now,

451
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,880
I'll find floor plans
for the Central City museum.

452
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,440
Let's just say I've saved you
the trouble...

453
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,440
and from being arrested.

454
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,600
How do you know all this?

455
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,360
The same way I'll know
if you even think

456
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,280
of raising a hand to your wife
and son.

457
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,960
I know who you are.

458
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,520
I know the man you become

459
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,520
and it's all I can do to keep from
ending you right here, right now.

460
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,960
But if I do, that means
my sister's never born

461
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,720
so you get a pass.

462
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,560
Your sister?

463
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,480
Looks like you didn't write yourself
out of the timeline.

464
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,040
- Looks like.
- But?

465
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,600
I don't know, I just thought
maybe things would feel differently.

466
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,240
The Englishman says it takes time
for time to change.

467
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,720
What were you trying to change?

468
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,320
My dad was never Father of the Year

469
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,240
but at least he never raised
a hand to any of us.

470
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,760
Until he went to prison,
which now he won't.

471
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,560
Let's get out of here.

472
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,160
Maybe we should have had Blake
show us around.

473
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,440
Perhaps there's a less conspicuous
way for us to do reconnaissance.

474
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,400
May I?

475
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,120
I'm not much of a dancer.

476
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:31,880
I'll lead, then.

477
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,760
Well, for a monster, you dance
quite gracefully, Miss Lance.

478
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,600
- Don't make fun.
- I know, I'm not.

479
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,040
Nor do I consider you a monster.

480
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,160
All I see is someone who is tortured

481
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,960
by an appetite
that she cannot control.

482
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,160
There's no magical cure
for what's wrong with me.

483
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,320
Of course, there is.
It's called being better.

484
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,760
When my family was killed,

485
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,760
I thought there was no way
I could go on...

486
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,520
but I did.

487
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,680
The truth of our existence is that
we're all blessed and cursed

488
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,240
with the drive to move forward.

489
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,560
Live the next day.

490
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,760
To get better.

491
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,000
And you will too, Sara.

492
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,560
Well, maybe I can start by managing
not to kill these guys.

493
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,160
They're scarred up like our friends
at the bank.

494
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,200
South African mercenaries.
Why didn't you say so?

495
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,920
Ladies first.

496
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,560
This area's restricted, folks.

497
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,440
I'm just looking
for the ladies' room.

498
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,520
Oh!

499
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,640
Hope you have a plan
to get him out of here.

500
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,360
Yep. There's a maintenance elevator
leads to a loading bay.

501
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,120
I'll have Gideon fly
the <i>Waverider</i>down.

502
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,440
I just wish we knew what Savage
was gonna do with Carter's body.

503
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,440
Why not stay and find out?

504
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,480
Ah, the Gareeb.

505
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,440
Mr. Blake has told us
so much about you.

506
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,680
I've located three fragments.

507
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,880
Okay, I see them.

508
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,800
Damn, they're big.

509
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,560
Remember, the initial blast
will create smaller pieces.

510
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,640
You'll need to...

511
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,360
<i>How does Jax put up with having
you in his head?</i>

512
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,040
I believe he finds my presence
rather comforting.

513
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,400
I doubt that very much.

514
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,120
Targeting system's overloaded.

515
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,560
Focus, Raymond.

516
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,680
Remember, you can do this.

517
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,800
It's not the suit.
It's you that Kendra needs right now.

518
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,040
Well done,
just one more fragment to go.

519
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,400
I see it. It's the biggest one yet.

520
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,480
You did it!

521
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,080
Well done.

522
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,640
I... I couldn't possibly
be more proud.

523
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,160
Well, maybe if you actually
remembered me being your student.

524
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,440
Right around the subclavian artery,
I remembered something.

525
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,240
How I figured the solve
to the Ehrenfest theorem...

526
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,840
two years after I was in your class.

527
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,920
Why did you tell me you remembered me
when you didn't?

528
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,480
Because you needed a push.

529
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,320
So all that stuff about me being
exceptional?

530
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,320
Was probably true.

531
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,880
The fact of the matter is...

532
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:09,080
I had many exceptional students
over the years.

533
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,160
I couldn't possibly remember
them all.

534
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,600
I was pretty amazing.

535
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,640
If that were true, I suspect
I'd have given you a higher grade.

536
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,560
I meant tonight.

537
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,600
Oh, yes.

538
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,840
On that score, I cannot disagree.

539
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,920
What are you planning on doing
with Carter's body?

540
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,680
Oh, you'll see.

541
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,120
Mr. Blake informs us that you were
hoping to steal our master's fortune.

542
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,080
But while money has its uses,
it is not the source of his power.

543
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,360
Then what is?

544
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,520
Let us show you.

545
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,800
<i>Hym nu setta, rash mun setta.</i>

546
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,040
Our numbers are legion.

547
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,920
All drawn to the man
who is immune to death.

548
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,840
Wealth is not power...

549
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,320
belief is.

550
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,840
<i>Hym nu setta, rash mun setta.</i>

551
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:16,360
<i>Hym nu setta, rash mun setta.</i>

552
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,800
Hello, Gareeb.

553
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,000
How long has it been?

554
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,560
4,000 years?

555
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,160
You look well.

556
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,280
When you and your friends
attacked my estate in St. Roch

557
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,560
I was afraid I wouldn't get
the chance to meet you once again.

558
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:48,440
Well, if there's something
that I've learned in 4,000 years...

559
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,440
it's patience.

560
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,160
And this time, I only had
to wait one short day.

561
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:03,240
You're probably wondering what my
plans are with your friend's body.

562
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,760
I already have his life's essence,
but his blood still has its uses.

563
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,680
<i>Hym nu setta, rash mun setta.</i>

564
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,800
Jack the Ripper showed me

565
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:21,040
the virtues of severing
the carotid artery.

566
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,120
<i>Hym nu setta.</i>

567
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,680
Okay, what's this now?

568
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,040
<i>Hym nu setta, rash mun setta.</i>

569
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,480
<i>Hym nu setta, rash mun setta.</i>

570
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:39,600
<i>Hym nu setta, rash mun setta.</i>

571
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,640
<i>Hym nu setta, rash mun setta.</i>

572
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,800
Centuries ago,
I discovered that although

573
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,600
immortality is mine alone...

574
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,680
I can share a taste...

575
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,920
with my faithful.

576
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,400
Help them to live an extra 100 years
or so.

577
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,960
<i>Hym nu setta, rash mun setta.</i>

578
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:06,440
<i>Hym nu setta, rash mun setta.</i>

579
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:11,440
<i>Hym nu setta, rash mun setta.
Hym nu setta...</i>

580
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:15,560
<i>Hum nu setta, rash mun...</i>

581
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,080
They're in trouble.

582
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,960
She appears to be hallucinating.

583
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,880
Rip... Sara... You have to save them!

584
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,920
Vandal! And Carter!

585
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,920
The Greyhill Building!
Carter! Rip! Sara!

586
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,280
Gideon, search Greyhill Building.

587
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,280
<i>I've already searched for it
on behalf of the Captain,</i>

588
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,640
<i>who's there now with Miss Lance.</i>

589
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,120
What? They left without us?

590
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,760
<i>It's a mansion several miles away.</i>

591
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,600
<i>Apparently, there's some
sort of private event.</i>

592
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,760
How the hell could Kendra know
that they're there?

593
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,200
You have to save them!

594
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,480
- What's going on?
- I don't know!

595
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,840
When we first met,
I asked you who you were.

596
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,880
Remember?
That was the wrong question.

597
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,120
I should have asked you "Why?"

598
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,720
Why did you seek to kill me?

599
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,880
What could I have possibly
done to deserve

600
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,880
that hatred I see burning
in your eyes.

601
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,840
Did I take something from you?

602
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,320
Someone?

603
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:17,200
Get your hands off that.

604
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,480
Ah, your wife, I take it.

605
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,920
Oh, she is lovely.

606
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,600
The boy has your eyes.

607
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,080
I'll be sure to keep
their picture close.

608
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,840
I don't remember killing them...

609
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,400
yet.

610
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,960
It seems like I have a lot
to look forward to.

611
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,960
Gideon, get me Jefferson.

612
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,240
<i>Mr. Jackson is not aboard.</i>

613
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,320
Oh, don't tell me...

614
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,800
<i>He's with Mr. Snart
and Mr. Rory on the Jumpship.</i>

615
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,280
<i>I'm patching you through.</i>

616
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,400
Jefferson?

617
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,440
Jefferson, where are you?

618
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,040
Well, it's not a short story.

619
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,120
<i>There's no time!</i>

620
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,800
<i>Gideon will upload you coordinates
to the Greyhill Building.</i>

621
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,640
Rip and Sara are in danger.

622
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,720
We're on our way, Professor.

623
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,280
This is a perversion.

624
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:10,640
No, this is the power
you have no hope of defeating.

625
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:15,760
Everyone here is sworn to live
and die at my command.

626
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,920
Why?

627
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,600
Because to them, I am a God!

628
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,560
I pity you.

629
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,760
You have no idea what it's like
to have people willing

630
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,880
to follow you up to the gates
of Hell!

631
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,960
Actually,
I have a little bit of an idea.

632
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:41,120
Let's get this party started!

633
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,600
Here's our invitation!

634
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,280
Well, this is different.

635
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,640
I didn't have him pegged
as the <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i> type.

636
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,240
Aah. Go! Here!

637
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,440
You came!

638
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,600
We're a team!
Next time, remember that.

639
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,680
Enough!

640
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,080
Get Carter's body out of here.

641
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,720
- Sara!
- I got this.

642
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,280
- Go! I'll deal with Savage.
- Good luck with that.

643
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,920
This is for Miranda and Jonas.

644
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:42,320
At least I know their names now.
Miranda and Jo...

645
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,040
Jonas.

646
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,880
I will heal...

647
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,360
and then, I will rise...

648
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,360
and I'll simply wait.

649
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:02,400
I... I am looking forward
to meeting them.

650
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,480
Sara. Sara.

651
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,600
Sara!

652
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,760
Gideon, I need a check
of the timeline.

653
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,840
Vandal Savage.

654
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,640
<i>The timeline is unchanged, Captain.</i>

655
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,760
<i>You know better than anyone
that Savage is immortal.</i>

656
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,960
<i>He cannot be killed through
conventional means.</i>

657
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,720
Which is why I need you to work
on finding out

658
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,600
where history records seeing him
next.

659
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,520
How is she?

660
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,600
Better.

661
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:45,040
Thank you for what you did
for Carter.

662
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,000
Believe me, it was a team effort.

663
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:50,000
As was, apparently, your recovery.

664
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,520
Well, actually,
I did most of the physical work

665
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,120
and Professor was there
for emotional support.

666
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:56,600
You're welcome.

667
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,880
Now, if we could just figure out
a way to wrest the Amon Dagger

668
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,200
out of Savage's hand into yours.

669
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,160
I don't think I'm exactly up to
taking him on right now.

670
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,160
No, but you will be...

671
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,560
and we'll help you get ready.

672
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,120
Maybe you didn't understand me.

673
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,200
I asked for the new timeline, Gideon.

674
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,360
<i>This is the new timeline.</i>

675
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,400
<i>Two days from now,
your father will be arrested</i>

676
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:28,480
<i>trying to sell the Maximilian Emerald
to an undercover police officer.</i>

677
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,160
Stupid son of a bitch.

678
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,640
<i>He'll be sentenced to five years
in Iron Heights.</i>

679
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,840
<i>Despite your intervention,
his future remains unchanged.</i>

680
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,520
Hey, you tried to save him.

681
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,880
That's got to count for something.

682
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,360
Turns out it doesn't.

683
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,960
Come on.

684
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,480
Where are we going now?

685
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,520
To say good-bye.

686
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,880
The other day, I tried to find some
words of inspiration.

687
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,000
Words that would restore hope to us
in the wake of our losses.

688
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,200
But, it is all of you
who have inspired me.

689
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,840
Beginning with Professor Boardman
and then with Carter,

690
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,720
their heroism is...

691
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,400
an inspiration to us all.

692
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:27,720
And a reminder that one person
acting alone can't save the world.

693
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,520
Come back to me.

694
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,600
Thank you.

695
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,040
Both of you.

696
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,960
We're sorry for your loss, Kendra.

697
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,800
I believe Anna would be proud.

698
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,520
As am I.

699
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,600
Gideon, ready us for takeoff.

700
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:30,080
Whoa, are we being chased
or something?

701
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,000
No, but I imagine that right about
now,

702
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,480
the museum has realized
that their prized emerald is missing.

703
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,160
You want me to say I'm sorry?

704
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,040
Sorry, I don't do sorry.

705
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:42,520
Which is fine, Mr. Rory,
because you are owed the apology.

706
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,520
I should have told you all before

707
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:47,000
that this wasn't my first attempt
to vanquish Vandal Savage.

708
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,560
But the reason I failed before...

709
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,280
was because you didn't have
all of us.

710
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,520
Obviously, Dr. Palmer and I had our
hands full tending to Miss Saunders.

711
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,280
But now that she's back
on her feet...

712
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,360
We're back to full strength.

713
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,240
Or as strong as we can be
without Carter.

714
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,720
Quite true.

715
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,960
But, there is no point in us
continuing any further.

716
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,080
Unless we are all
and... myself included...

717
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,400
committed to working in concert.

718
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,640
You don't ditch us,
we won't ditch you. Deal?

719
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,800
<i>Sir, I've completed my review
of the timeline.</i>

720
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:26,480
<i>I calculate a 98 percent likelihood
that Savage reappears in 1986.</i>

721
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,000
Chart a course, Gideon.

722
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,360
Guess we're headed to the '80s.

723
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,200
Better break out your
parachute pants.

724
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,760
What the hell are parachute pants?
