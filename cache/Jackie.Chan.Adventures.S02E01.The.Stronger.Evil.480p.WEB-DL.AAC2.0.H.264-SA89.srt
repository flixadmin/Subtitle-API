1
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:05,637
It would seem
we have lost

2
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:08,574
the lost treasure
of q'in shi'huang.

3
00:00:08,576 --> 00:00:11,010
On the bright side,
however,

4
00:00:11,012 --> 00:00:13,979
Jackie chan has done me
a tremendous favor

5
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:16,248
by eliminating
my albatross.

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,449
Albatross?

7
00:00:17,451 --> 00:00:19,585
Thought shendu
was a dragon.

8
00:00:19,587 --> 00:00:24,323
Which means we now have
exclusive access to...

9
00:00:24,325 --> 00:00:28,660
Some very potent magic.

10
00:01:22,615 --> 00:01:23,682
Jade: Jackie.

11
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:25,050
We can't move back
to uncle's.

12
00:01:25,052 --> 00:01:26,318
It reeks in there--

13
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,220
like mung beans
and mothballs.

14
00:01:28,222 --> 00:01:29,922
And it's totally boring.

15
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:32,825
Jade, you say <i> boring</i>
àlike it's a bad thing.

16
00:01:32,827 --> 00:01:34,093
Aw!

17
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:38,564
Jackie!

18
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:39,865
Uncle! We're
moving back in.

19
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:40,933
Ow!

20
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:42,701
You cannot move back!

21
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:43,769
Why not?

22
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:46,105
Where will tohru sleep?

23
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:52,811
You've been jacked.

24
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:55,547
Oh, well. Guess we'll
just have to stay

25
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:57,883
in our supersecret
underground base.

26
00:01:57,885 --> 00:01:59,718
Jade, there's no reason
for us to live

27
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,520
in section 13 anymore.

28
00:02:01,522 --> 00:02:02,921
Are you sure
about that?

29
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:04,923
Valmont's still at large,
remember?

30
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:07,793
I am an archeologist,
not a secret agent.

31
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:09,461
What about the talismans?

32
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:10,863
Buried in the earth,

33
00:02:10,865 --> 00:02:12,464
along with shendu
and his palace.

34
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,066
But what makes you so sure

35
00:02:14,068 --> 00:02:16,668
we've seen the last
of the big, bad dragon?

36
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,472
Once I make
Jackie chan pay,

37
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:23,976
I shall tear that buffoon
valmont to pieces.

38
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:25,444
Silence!

39
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:28,680
The only future you have
is here, with us...

40
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:30,249
Brother.

41
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:34,486
Indeed.
Let the eternal torment begin.

42
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:35,554
Torment?

43
00:02:35,556 --> 00:02:36,622
Eternal?

44
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:38,423
To punish your
betrayal, shendu.

45
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:41,560
You chose to spend
your time ruling China.

46
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:45,197
While we withered
in this bone-dry pit.

47
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,433
Bored out of our wits
all those centuries,

48
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:51,436
each exactly like
the one before it.

49
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:54,573
You never even
attempted to free us.

50
00:02:54,575 --> 00:02:55,674
Uh...

51
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:59,444
Your rescue was in
the planning stages,

52
00:02:59,446 --> 00:03:02,214
but I became imprisoned
in a statue.

53
00:03:02,216 --> 00:03:03,649
Excuses!

54
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:05,651
You desired
the earthly realm

55
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:06,818
for you alone.

56
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,020
Gaaah!

57
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:10,222
A shame you never learned
to share, brother.

58
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:11,623
No! Wait!

59
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,193
I...Can free you.

60
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:16,061
Do not toy with us.

61
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:19,798
The doors can only be opened
from the other side.

62
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,367
The human side.

63
00:03:22,369 --> 00:03:24,136
Precisely.

64
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:28,273
As the humble spirit
you now see before you,

65
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:30,609
I am free to cross over

66
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:34,046
and possess
any human I wish,

67
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:37,416
enabling me to undo
the sacred spells

68
00:03:37,418 --> 00:03:39,017
which keep you here...

69
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:42,854
If you so deem it.

70
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,458
12 talismans,

71
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,026
4 enforcers--

72
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:49,194
3 each.

73
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:50,362
Uh, boss?

74
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:51,997
There's only 3 of us

75
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:53,999
since tohru cashed in
his frequent-flier miles.

76
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:55,801
So I'll just hang on
to these.

77
00:03:55,803 --> 00:03:57,302
Hungry crane spear fish!

78
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:58,704
Agh!

79
00:03:58,706 --> 00:04:01,406
(Growling)

80
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,875
Everyone remembers hak foo?

81
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:06,111
Ha ha. Hiya, hak.

82
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:07,546
Or do you
prefer "foo"?

83
00:04:07,548 --> 00:04:09,414
Valmont: <i> Master</i> foo.

84
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:13,752
The black tiger shall be
your new lieutenant.

85
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:16,388
Jade: Ooh!

86
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,558
Section 13
is so cool.

87
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,059
Careful.

88
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:23,795
Positronic shock wave
will atomize your brain.

89
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:25,764
Hey, kepler.
Whatcha workin' on?

90
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,366
Solid-state,
particle-beam-driven,

91
00:04:27,368 --> 00:04:29,768
high-density,
hypnosis-inducing
phase shifter.

92
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,169
2-speed.

93
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:33,572
Uh, sounds complicated.

94
00:04:33,574 --> 00:04:35,307
(Chuckles)

95
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:36,642
Hardly.

96
00:04:36,644 --> 00:04:38,877
Ooh. When are you gonna
finish your jet pack?

97
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:39,945
Whoa!

98
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:41,013
Yesterday.

99
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:43,915
(Humming a tune)

100
00:04:43,917 --> 00:04:45,784
Jackieee!

101
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:46,952
Not now, Jade.

102
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,654
I'm bus--Jade!

103
00:04:48,656 --> 00:04:50,122
Whoa!
Hey!
Ohh!

104
00:04:50,124 --> 00:04:52,591
Waaah!

105
00:04:57,063 --> 00:04:59,064
Jade, what are you--
talk later!

106
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:01,366
Sorry!
Sorry!

107
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:02,868
Whoa!
Waah!

108
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,837
Ceiling!
Wah!

109
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,938
Whoa!
Whoa!

110
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,907
Jackie: Make it stop!
Make it stop!

111
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:11,143
Oh. Stop.

112
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,446
Whew!
Whew!

113
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:15,647
Yaah!
Yaah!

114
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,215
Unh!
Uhh!

115
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:21,787
Heh. Talk now?

116
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:24,356
Jade, you should never
play with things

117
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:25,957
you don't know
how to work.

118
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,626
I didn't know
I didn't know.

119
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:28,860
Now I do.

120
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:30,796
Well, perhaps
now you <i> know</i>

121
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:32,497
why we have to leave
section 13.

122
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,900
But tohru will have
nowhere to sleep.

123
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:37,602
I found a very charming
apartment for us.

124
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:39,304
They allow children
and pets,

125
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:41,873
but no secret agents,
dark hand thugs,

126
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,408
or magic talismans.

127
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,943
(Alarm sounds)

128
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:46,578
Jackie!
- Robbery in progress.

129
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,813
Financial district.

130
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:49,481
It's the dark hand.

131
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:51,583
Uh...Good luck
with that?

132
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:53,118
They're packin' heat--

133
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,820
talisman heat.

134
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,760
(Explosion)

135
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:04,896
Aah! Aah!
Watch out! Help!

136
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,813
Me strong like ox.

137
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:26,218
Freeze!

138
00:06:27,253 --> 00:06:29,388
Ooph!
Ohh!

139
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,856
Watch out.

140
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:32,391
Snake in the grass.

141
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:36,228
And this little piggy
went to market.

142
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:42,167
Hyah!

143
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,369
Astral projection?

144
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:45,971
Motion to the motionless?

145
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:47,038
Yin Yang?

146
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,075
How come I get
all the loser powers?

147
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,579
Mule kick. Hah!

148
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,382
No fair.
You're not even using yours.

149
00:06:57,384 --> 00:06:59,885
The horse for healing?

150
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:01,720
I am not easily injured.

151
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:03,588
The rooster for levitation?

152
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,524
I already fly.

153
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:07,692
The dog for immortality?

154
00:07:07,694 --> 00:07:10,862
There is not a man alive
who can vanquish me.

155
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,331
It's cool.

156
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,433
Trade ya.

157
00:07:14,435 --> 00:07:16,301
Baby.

158
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,171
Score!

159
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,441
(Alarm)

160
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:23,809
Movie it! Move it!
Move it! Move it!

161
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:25,143
Go!
Come on!

162
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:33,185
I know you're eager to get on
with your life, my friend,

163
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:35,587
but you know more about
these talismans than anyone.

164
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:36,988
But--

165
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,524
I need you, Jackie...
One last time.

166
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,894
(Sighs) One last time.

167
00:07:42,896 --> 00:07:44,429
Just when you
think you're out,

168
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:45,831
they pull you
back in.

169
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:46,932
So can I--

170
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:48,133
no.
No.

171
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:51,436
(Grunts)

172
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:53,538
Didn't even let me ask.

173
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,240
And if I didn't ask,

174
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:58,210
how am I supposed to know
what they said no to?

175
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:00,579
Ahem!

176
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:02,881
Hey, kepler,
how does this work?

177
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:05,383
Ignition, steering,
throttle, brakes.

178
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:08,119
<i>Grazie.</i>

179
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:10,455
Ha ha! We're like
superheroes...

180
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:11,623
Who steal stuff.

181
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:13,792
(Loud rumbling)

182
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,531
Freeze!

183
00:08:19,533 --> 00:08:22,133
Step away
from the vehicle.

184
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:23,902
Hyah!

185
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,311
Here's lookin' at ya.

186
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,385
Oh, look, ma--
no hands.

187
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,725
(Out of breath)

188
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:48,426
Bad day.

189
00:08:48,428 --> 00:08:51,062
Shendu: So, I trust
you would agree

190
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:54,065
that my, uh...
Martyrdom

191
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:55,600
has left a void

192
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:58,837
for a new, stronger evil
to fill--

193
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:03,241
namely you,
- my brothers and sisters.

194
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:05,810
Shall I proceed, then?

195
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,282
What trick is this?

196
00:09:10,284 --> 00:09:12,417
You have proven
crafty, brother,

197
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:14,886
so we require
a safety measure.

198
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:17,422
Our spell
will keep you bound

199
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:19,257
within the human
of your choosing

200
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:22,027
until
you release us.

201
00:09:22,029 --> 00:09:24,729
A precaution
so that we know exactly

202
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,331
where to find you.

203
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,934
In the event we
deem it necessary

204
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:31,570
to resume your
eternal torment.

205
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:34,306
I accept your terms.

206
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:37,275
I will choose
my vessel well

207
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:39,578
to best serve you,

208
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,347
and the human most capable
for this task

209
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:46,618
is my Nemesis--
Jackie chan.

210
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,792
Ooh, rabbit for speed.

211
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:04,536
Immortality
<i>and</i> healing?

212
00:10:04,538 --> 00:10:05,971
That's redundant.

213
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:10,709
Ooh!

214
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:12,577
(Moaning)

215
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:14,946
I'll swap you.

216
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:16,081
Take Mr. ed.

217
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,216
Hey, my headache's gone.

218
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:20,385
You dirty <i> rats!</i>

219
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,224
Let's go!
Go!
Let's move!

220
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:32,664
That'll do, pig.
That'll do.

221
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,703
All agents, fall back!

222
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:40,505
Repeat: Fall back!

223
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,976
One last time.

224
00:10:44,978 --> 00:10:48,380
Jackie, I said fall back!
That means you, too!

225
00:10:48,382 --> 00:10:50,615
I'm not an agent.

226
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:57,522
(Gasping for breath)

227
00:10:57,524 --> 00:10:59,324
Need a lift?

228
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:03,928
I told you
never to play with things

229
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,263
you don't know how to--

230
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:07,432
ignition, steering,
throttle, brakes.

231
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:10,235
(Stammers)
Faster.

232
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:23,081
Whoa. That is weird.

233
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,482
Lose them.

234
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:26,651
Can't tail
what you can't see.

235
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:33,324
Whoa!
Huh?

236
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,563
It was worth a shot.

237
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:45,670
Jackie!

238
00:11:49,942 --> 00:11:52,343
Aah! Hot! Hot! Hot!

239
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:54,379
Heads up!
Aah!

240
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,781
(Gasps) Look out!

241
00:11:56,783 --> 00:11:59,584
Yeah, like
- I'm gonna fall for tha--

242
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,121
(groaning)

243
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:05,523
Immortality hurts.

244
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:15,533
Chan!

245
00:12:16,635 --> 00:12:18,536
Ow! Ow! Ow!

246
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,509
Get your mitts off of me!

247
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:26,311
Blast him!

248
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:28,313
Walrus!

249
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,334
Walrus?

250
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:52,137
Change him back.

251
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,206
(Cell phone rings)

252
00:12:57,176 --> 00:13:00,078
What is taking you so long?

253
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,313
Uh, flat tire?

254
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:04,549
Yaaah!

255
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,254
You seek the talismans?

256
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:11,523
One on one.

257
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:14,926
2 on one.

258
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:16,261
2 1/2.

259
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:20,565
(Engine revs)

260
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:22,267
Aaah!

261
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:24,235
Black tiger
crushes bald eagle.

262
00:13:27,706 --> 00:13:28,940
Ohh!

263
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:30,008
(Moaning)

264
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:34,212
Angry crow takes flight!

265
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:38,449
Ye-aah!

266
00:13:40,719 --> 00:13:42,787
Bye-bye.
Have a nice day.

267
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:43,922
Uh-oh.

268
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:45,490
Payback time!

269
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,999
Jade, what are you doing?

270
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,401
I can take him.

271
00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:58,570
I can fly!

272
00:13:58,572 --> 00:14:02,006
No! Jade! <i> Jade!</i>

273
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,852
Stop!

274
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,656
Well, well.

275
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,642
Hyah!

276
00:14:37,644 --> 00:14:38,943
Oof!

277
00:14:38,945 --> 00:14:42,380
(Moaning)

278
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,648
Huh?

279
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:47,852
Gas? Kepler never
mentioned fill-ups.

280
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,759
Jade!

281
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,462
Jackie: Jade!

282
00:14:58,497 --> 00:15:01,266
Valmont: Hyah!

283
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:03,034
What?

284
00:15:03,036 --> 00:15:05,069
Oof! Unh!

285
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,846
(Shendu's voice)
No!

286
00:15:14,848 --> 00:15:17,715
Aah!

287
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:21,119
(Both groaning)

288
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:25,189
(Grunting)

289
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:26,624
No!

290
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:31,195
Trapped within this
proven failure of an Ally.

291
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:32,297
(Groaning)

292
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:35,633
All the more reason
to hasten my quest.

293
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:38,069
(Gasps)
No.

294
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:46,544
We have more important matters
to attend to. Get in!

295
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:47,779
We'll just
grab the loot and--

296
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:50,014
no loot! Get in now!

297
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:53,785
Really?
Sore throat, boss?

298
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:55,286
You don't sound too good.

299
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:57,355
(Groaning)

300
00:16:01,026 --> 00:16:02,160
(Valmont's voice)
Why are you standing there?

301
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:04,095
Collect the cash!

302
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:05,930
But you said--

303
00:16:05,932 --> 00:16:07,665
are you questioning me?

304
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,170
Where are you going?

305
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:15,106
Come here,
or I shall destroy you all.

306
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,813
(Grunting)

307
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:24,048
Yo, wait up!

308
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,117
Ohh!

309
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:35,994
Black here.
Need transport back to hq.

310
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:37,295
And to Chinatown.

311
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:39,230
I'll have Jade
spend the night
at uncle's.

312
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:42,433
Jade: I heard that!

313
00:16:42,435 --> 00:16:44,002
It doesn't make sense.

314
00:16:44,004 --> 00:16:45,236
We were down for the count.

315
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:48,272
Why leave the spoils?

316
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,244
Finn: We must have left
millions on that beach.

317
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:55,580
What is the deal, big v?

318
00:16:55,582 --> 00:16:57,015
Aah!

319
00:16:57,017 --> 00:17:00,184
Shendu: Valmont
cannot hear you.

320
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,252
(Gasps)

321
00:17:01,254 --> 00:17:02,653
Uh-oh.
Shendu?

322
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:04,989
(Singsong)
He's back.

323
00:17:04,991 --> 00:17:06,824
Your talismans,
Mr. shendu.

324
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:08,793
We was taking care
of 'em for ya.

325
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:10,928
We'll just, uh,
be on our way.

326
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,167
Keep your talismans.

327
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:18,369
They no longer matter to me.

328
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:20,138
(Groaning)

329
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,211
Valmont: How did I--

330
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,113
where is the money?

331
00:17:29,115 --> 00:17:32,617
Uh, big v,
shendu's back.

332
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:34,852
What?! Where?!

333
00:17:34,854 --> 00:17:37,121
Inside you.

334
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,293
That's preposter--

335
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:44,095
aah! Aah!

336
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:45,496
Get out!

337
00:17:45,498 --> 00:17:47,165
Shendu:
Trust me, valmont,

338
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:48,833
the feeling is mutual,

339
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:51,035
but for now,
you and your thugs

340
00:17:51,037 --> 00:17:52,370
will assist me

341
00:17:52,372 --> 00:17:54,605
or perish.

342
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:57,375
Whoa!

343
00:17:58,710 --> 00:17:59,777
Got it!

344
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:02,080
We're swinging
to your beat.

345
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:04,715
Uncle: Uncle is not
running a hotel!

346
00:18:04,717 --> 00:18:05,783
Jade!

347
00:18:05,785 --> 00:18:08,186
Help tohru make your bed.

348
00:18:09,521 --> 00:18:11,589
I'll take it
from here, t.

349
00:18:12,524 --> 00:18:13,991
(Doorbell rings)

350
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:15,793
Aiyaah!

351
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:18,729
We are closed!

352
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:21,065
Aah! Uhh...

353
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:26,304
Uhh...

354
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:27,405
Master?

355
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,041
(Groaning)

356
00:18:30,976 --> 00:18:33,444
I will show you the door!

357
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:35,980
Uhh!

358
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:37,982
Aah!

359
00:18:37,984 --> 00:18:39,383
Uhh!

360
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:40,685
(Groans)

361
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:05,143
(Singsong)
Oh, Jackie...

362
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,149
Jade: Valmont's inside,

363
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,117
and he tossed tohru
like a feather.

364
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,986
He must have
the talismans.

365
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:17,455
Stay with uncle.
Aw!

366
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:26,998
Ohh...

367
00:19:34,406 --> 00:19:37,241
Talismans, right?

368
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:47,084
Black: Gone.

369
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:49,820
Why did he take
one of uncle's books?

370
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:51,255
(Both gasp)

371
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:57,562
But I don't understand.

372
00:19:57,564 --> 00:20:00,198
Valmont can't summon
the shadowkhan.

373
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,700
Only shendu.

374
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:05,203
Shendu:
Reports of my demise

375
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:08,506
have been greatly
exaggerated, chan.

376
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:09,974
Whoa.
(Gasps)

377
00:20:09,976 --> 00:20:12,343
Destroy them.

378
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:27,725
Hey, Jackie

379
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:28,793
if you could have

380
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:29,860
any one of the talismans,

381
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:31,028
which one would you want?

382
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,096
Not just one.

383
00:20:32,098 --> 00:20:34,198
I think lifting--
everything.

384
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:37,101
Yeah.
I want to be fly,
I want to be fast,

385
00:20:37,103 --> 00:20:38,936
I want to be invincible.

386
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:41,539
If I really can have
all the talismans,

387
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:42,607
wow!

388
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:43,708
You can imagine

389
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,509
how many things
I can do.

390
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:47,845
I almost can save
the whole world.
