1
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:07,526
What did you say to Gus?

2
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:11,113
- Because he's on to us. Yeah.
- What do you mean he's on to us?

3
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,283
He's walking to his car,
then suddenly he isn't.

4
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:16,285
What, does he have a sixth sense?

5
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,203
Jesus. What did you say to him?

6
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:21,790
Could I ask my own question right now
at this point?

7
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:24,459
Did you just bring a bomb
into a hospital?

8
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:27,921
What, was I supposed to leave it
on his car?

9
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:30,841
What, you're supposed to bring it
to a hospital?

10
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,884
Oh, my God.

11
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,344
Look.

12
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,722
Where can we find Gus?

13
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:39,725
Name a place. One place
where I can surprise him

14
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,352
where he won't see me coming.

15
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:46,356
Because his house, the laundry

16
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:49,693
the restaurant, factory farm,
all wired with cameras.

17
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,820
One place.

18
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,823
Think. Jesse, think.

19
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,908
Where is it? Where?

20
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:59,578
Because if you can't tell me

21
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:01,663
we are dead.

22
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,133
Jesse?

23
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,552
I don't... I don't know.

24
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,679
Well, maybe...

25
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:20,307
Excuse me. Jesse Pinkman?

26
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:23,560
- Yeah.
- Hi. Detective Kalanchoe.

27
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:26,021
Detective Munn, Albuquerque Police.

28
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:30,233
We were wondering if we could have
a few minutes. Go someplace and talk.

29
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,485
About what?

30
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:34,279
- Sorry, I didn't catch your name.
- About what?

31
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:36,156
It concerns Brock Cantillo,

32
00:02:36,323 --> 00:02:38,617
and a statement you made to his mother.

33
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,369
How about you come with us?

34
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,580
We just wanna clear a few things up,
no big deal.

35
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:24,413
- So am I under arrest?
- No, you're not under arrest.

36
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,747
{\an8}We're just talking.

37
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,959
{\an8}So if I get tired of talking,
can I get up and leave?

38
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:31,461
{\an8}We'd prefer you didn't.

39
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:33,171
{\an8}- You'd prefer.
- Yeah.

40
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:37,676
{\an8}Jesse, why'd you tell Brock's mom
that the boy had been poisoned?

41
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:43,348
{\an8}Look, I think this has been, you know

42
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,976
what do call it? Overblown.

43
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:47,978
Because all I basically said was:

44
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:52,315
"Have the doctors thought
maybe Brock got poisoned?"

45
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,443
In a cover-all-bases kind of sense.

46
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:58,697
Yeah, I'm sure they appreciate that.
You helping them out like that.

47
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,782
Especially how specific you were.

48
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,909
Ricin, wow.

49
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,621
{\an8}Ricin, that's definitely a big one.
You don't see that every day.

50
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:10,041
{\an8}So when doctors hear that,
they take it very seriously.

51
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,085
As do we.

52
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,255
- As does the FBI.
- Okay.

53
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:18,049
Nice, you trying to help out
like that and all.

54
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:22,345
You know, professional courtesy,
sharing your expertise.

55
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:26,975
{\an8}Look, I ain't got no expertise, all right?
I just, you know...

56
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,436
{\an8}You happened to guess this rare poison

57
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,814
might be the thing
that put this boy in the hospital.

58
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:37,277
Congratulations. Because his doctors,
they think that you might just be right.

59
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:40,739
{\an8}So why ricin?
Jesse, how'd you come up with that?

60
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:45,827
{\an8}I think I've... I don't know, I must've
saw it on <i>House</i> or something.

61
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:50,123
{\an8}Yeah, you know, like, <i>House</i>
or the Discovery Channel.

62
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,210
{\an8}Sometimes your brain
just makes these connections.

63
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,212
- Does it?
- Mine does.

64
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:57,130
That's interesting.

65
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,841
Look, I gotta get back.

66
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,219
But we're still talking.

67
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:06,765
{\an8}So I'm not under arrest,
but I can't leave.

68
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,894
{\an8}So then, I guess

69
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,396
{\an8}I should call my lawyer, right?

70
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:16,525
{\an8}We're just having
a simple conversation, Jess.

71
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:19,444
{\an8}Why can't we keep talking, keep it light?

72
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:22,113
{\an8}You know how it is
when the lawyers get to it.

73
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,658
{\an8}Suddenly,
everything's a big pissing match.

74
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,952
{\an8}- Like, every time.
- Adversarial.

75
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:29,579
{\an8}Adversarial.
Then we gotta book you. Right?

76
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,666
{\an8}I mean, you know.
You've been around the block, Jesse.

77
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,918
{\an8}You're no Boy Scout.

78
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,880
Saul Goodman.

79
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,924
That's my guy.

80
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:44,594
So do I gotta call him or do you?

81
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:23,300
What the hell are you doing?

82
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:25,844
- I need Saul. Right now.
- So you break in?

83
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,387
- You just break in.
- I see you're here.

84
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:32,350
{\an8}If you'd answer the phone or the door,
maybe I wouldn't... Forget it.

85
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,144
{\an8}Is he here?

86
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:37,063
{\an8}Is that a serious question?
Why would he be here?

87
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,566
But you know where he is.
I need a number.

88
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:42,485
{\an8}Look, let me explain something to you.

89
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,988
{\an8}- My partner and I...
- Are in danger?

90
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:47,991
{\an8}Whoopty-freakingdoo.
Why do you think he's not here?

91
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:51,995
{\an8}And how's that news, exactly,
the two of you being in danger?

92
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:53,830
{\an8}After doing something idiotic?

93
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:56,666
{\an8}What gives you the right
to break down my door?

94
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,336
{\an8}Look, I just need a number, okay?
That's all.

95
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:03,256
{\an8}You are such a pain in my ass,
you know that?

96
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:06,384
You're the reason
I gotta go on unemployment.

97
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:09,179
I was looking forward
to getting out of here.

98
00:07:09,346 --> 00:07:12,015
{\an8}But, no, now I gotta wait around all day,

99
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:15,226
{\an8}for a guy to come fix this door.
Who pays for this?

100
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,520
Okay, you know what?

101
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,774
Here, look, I'm giving you everything.
All of it, okay?

102
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,067
There's one, two...

103
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:26,154
Look, there's gotta be at least
1700 dollars there, okay?

104
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:29,866
More than cover the cost of the door.
Now, I apologize profusely.

105
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:32,369
Please. The phone number.

106
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,998
{\an8}A door like this is gonna cost
way more than 1700.

107
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:39,501
{\an8}What, for a plate of glass? No.

108
00:07:39,668 --> 00:07:42,003
{\an8}Oh, yeah. I bet it does.

109
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,965
I bet you it winds up costing

110
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,550
20,000.

111
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:51,137
Are you insane?

112
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:56,017
{\an8}Who the hell is going to charge
$20,000 for a plate-glass door?

113
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,770
{\an8}There's no reputable vendor would...

114
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,404
{\an8}Now I'm thinking 25.

115
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:15,912
I'll be right back.

116
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,232
Yes. Albuquerque, New Mexico.

117
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:31,654
The number of Rebecca Simmons,
306 Negra Arroyo Lane.

118
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:35,742
Would you connect it for me, please?
Thank you.

119
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,957
Becky, hi. It's Walter White.

120
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:44,751
Listen, I wo...

121
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:48,463
I'm fine. I'm fine. How are you?

122
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:51,049
Oh, good, good.

123
00:09:51,216 --> 00:09:53,301
Yes, cats are...

124
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:54,677
Listen.

125
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,889
Skyler and I are out of town,
on our way to Santa Fe,

126
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:01,351
and Junior just told us that he thinks

127
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:05,021
he may have left the burner on
on the stove.

128
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:08,650
Yes, God forbid, there's a fire.

129
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:12,904
Well, that's why I'm calling.
You se... I just wanted to ask,

130
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:16,741
and I'm sorry to do this,
but do you still have the key?

131
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:20,703
You do? Good.
And would you be willing to...?

132
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,749
Oh, you are a lifesaver.
Thank you so much.

133
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:27,418
Yes. Okay.

134
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:31,673
Okay. I'll await your call.
Thank you so much. Bye-bye.

135
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,940
There you go.

136
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,734
Becky?

137
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:22,158
Oh, that's good. That's a relief.

138
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:26,037
I owe you one. Bigtime.

139
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,773
So how's he doing?

140
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:41,946
You could at least say, instead
of being a couple dicks about it.

141
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:46,034
Jesse, if you care at all
about that little boy

142
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,202
prove it to me.

143
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,163
Tell us what you know.

144
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,749
- I told you what I know.
- Tell us again.

145
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:57,045
What are you, like, broken records?

146
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,714
I was trying to be helpful.

147
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:01,799
End of story.

148
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,970
Guess we'll wait and see
what the tox screen says.

149
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,602
Look at this. Isn't this cozy?
What'd you tell them?

150
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,229
I told them they're a couple of dicks.

151
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:16,439
He's a wordsmith.

152
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:20,026
Well, detectives, it's been a pleasure.
Now, up you go

153
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:24,197
make like you got manners,
make like you respect the rule of law.

154
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:29,327
<i>Au revoir, auf Wiedersehen,</i>
<i>hasta luego</i>, get the hell out.

155
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:33,414
Bye-bye. That's it, pick it up.
Follow your partner.

156
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,291
And one-two.

157
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,168
Thank you.

158
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,379
Christ. You two...?

159
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:43,257
If I ever get anal polyps,
I'll know what to name them.

160
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,551
Are you gonna get me out of here?

161
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:50,390
No. Not even if I could.

162
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:54,018
You know, the FBI's gonna show up
on this ricin thing,

163
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:57,438
and then you're in it for the duration.

164
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,274
You're a lot safer in here.

165
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:02,985
They tried to get your partner
in his own home.

166
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,196
Jesus.

167
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:06,656
Is he okay?

168
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:10,493
Well, he's okay like a fruit fly's okay.

169
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,538
Now, we're all on the clock here
and thanks for that.

170
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,290
Wanna go stick your wangs
in a hornet's nest

171
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:20,878
it's a free country. But how come
I always get sloppy seconds, huh?

172
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:25,716
You got anything for me? Tell me
I didn't poke my head up for nothing.

173
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:29,637
Yeah.

174
00:15:29,804 --> 00:15:31,681
I've been thinking...

175
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:33,724
And?

176
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:36,769
Casa Tranquila.

177
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,271
What's Casa Tranquila?

178
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,815
It's an old folks' home
off Paseo Del Norte.

179
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:44,318
Our boy tells me Fring took him
to visit one of the patients.

180
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,155
Someone Pinkman says
you'll definitely remember:

181
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,323
Tio Salamanca.

182
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,327
Old guy in a wheelchair?

183
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:58,624
Doesn't talk, rings a bell.

184
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,793
I mean, does that ring a bell?

185
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,965
- The guy actually has to ring a bell.
- Yes, I know. I remember.

186
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,469
So, what, once every blue moon

187
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:13,389
Gus goes and visits
an old cartel associate.

188
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:16,350
That doesn't help me.

189
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,353
I can't hide out in a nursing home
for six months

190
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,524
hoping on the off chance
that he comes back.

191
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:26,402
It's not even like they're friends.

192
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:29,947
Pinkman said it was like
he was torturing the old guy.

193
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,033
What does that mean?

194
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:36,871
He told him the last of his family
was dead. He enjoyed telling him.

195
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:39,832
Pinkman asked him about it.
All Gus would say

196
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,419
was that this Tio character
murdered someone close to him.

197
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:47,340
Wait.
Tio murdered someone close to Gus?

198
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:50,718
I know,
it sounds not particularly fruitful.

199
00:16:50,885 --> 00:16:54,972
But, sorry, that's all I got.

200
00:16:56,182 --> 00:17:00,102
They're enemies, not friends.

201
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:05,566
Next number in this cover-all game
where you cover the whole shimoly

202
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:10,530
is B number three,
like Goldilocks and the Three Bears.

203
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:14,200
That's number three in your B column.

204
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:18,412
Followed by O, seven, four

205
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:23,876
that's O, 74,
on the other side of your card.

206
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:30,550
Now we have
that lucky number B, number seven.

207
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,177
Is it lucky for you?

208
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:35,179
B, seven.

209
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:37,974
In the I row, two, one.

210
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,226
I, 21.

211
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:43,020
I know you despise me.

212
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,816
And I know how badly
you wanna see me dead.

213
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,279
But I'm willing to bet that I know a man
whom you hate even more.

214
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,865
Those N's just keep coming.
They're all sticking together.

215
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:59,620
I'm offering you an opportunity
for revenge.

216
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,914
G column, four, eight

217
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:06,127
the continental United States,
excluding Alaska and Hawaii.

218
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,231
Okay. I'm here.

219
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:31,902
How you doing this morning,
Mr. Salamanca? You need something?

220
00:18:32,068 --> 00:18:34,321
You need to go poopie, huh?

221
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,823
Did you go poopie already? No?

222
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,658
What do you need?

223
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,036
You want me to get the board for you?

224
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:42,662
Okay.

225
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,957
All right.

226
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:51,213
Okay. Here we go.

227
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:55,675
A, E, I...

228
00:18:55,842 --> 00:19:01,515
Row I. I, J, K, L, M, N...

229
00:19:01,681 --> 00:19:03,558
First letter N.

230
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:05,310
A, E...

231
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:09,606
Row E. E... Second letter E.

232
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:12,400
A, E... Row E.

233
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:15,487
E... Next letter E.

234
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,781
A... Row A.

235
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:21,743
A, B, C, D...

236
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,870
Next letter D.

237
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,956
A... Row A.

238
00:19:26,122 --> 00:19:29,668
A, B, C, D...

239
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,461
Next letter D.

240
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:34,089
A, E... Row E.

241
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:37,133
E... E.

242
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,052
A... Row A.

243
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,638
A... Next letter A.

244
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:46,601
A, E, I, O, U...

245
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:55,061
I don't think we're finished,
Mr. Salamanca. A, E, I, O, U.

246
00:19:55,318 --> 00:19:58,113
Finish the word, Mr. Salamanca.

247
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:01,533
Is it "dear?"

248
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,370
Is it "deal?"

249
00:20:08,456 --> 00:20:12,168
Honey, "dea" ain't a word.
Help me out here.

250
00:20:39,362 --> 00:20:43,450
- Hey, son, what's up?
- When exactly are you getting here?

251
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,785
<i>Just as soon as I can.</i>

252
00:20:45,952 --> 00:20:49,789
Look, this is a serious situation
and you're not taking it seriously.

253
00:20:49,956 --> 00:20:50,999
Let me talk to him.

254
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,377
- <i>Son, I am taking this seriously.</i>
- Give it to me, Walter.

255
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:57,339
<i>I'm concerned about your Uncle Hank
and his safety.</i>

256
00:20:57,505 --> 00:21:01,217
But whomever is making these threats
against him

257
00:21:01,384 --> 00:21:04,554
I can assure you,
there's absolutely no interest in me.

258
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,514
I'm not on anyone's radar.

259
00:21:06,681 --> 00:21:09,809
<i>- And besides, your mother and I...</i>
- Give it to me. Walter.

260
00:21:09,976 --> 00:21:13,813
Did you hear what he said?
Get over here. No more excuses.

261
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,275
Marie, I will be there
just as soon as I can.

262
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,542
- I promise.
<i>- Hold on.</i>

263
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:23,198
You wanna weigh in here?
Maybe you can talk sense into him?

264
00:21:23,365 --> 00:21:26,451
Marie, he'll get here
when he gets here so...

265
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:31,873
I hope you sell plenty of air fresheners.

266
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,334
<i>I hope you have a banner day over there.</i>

267
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:37,921
Okay, Walt, don't worry
about a thing here. Goodbye.

268
00:21:39,297 --> 00:21:43,385
And thank you for all of your help.

269
00:21:43,551 --> 00:21:45,136
What's that?

270
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,771
Anything?

271
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,540
- Hey, everyone.
- Hi, Steve.

272
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:16,626
- How's everybody holding out?
- The man I wanna see.

273
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:18,586
Come here. Look at this.

274
00:22:19,587 --> 00:22:22,882
- Jesus, enough with the laundry.
- No, no, no, hear me out.

275
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:27,429
This panel, if I'm reading it correctly,
is 7200 amp service.

276
00:22:27,595 --> 00:22:31,599
This place has two of them, right?
That's a whole lot of juice, brother.

277
00:22:31,766 --> 00:22:34,477
Laundry this size, typically,
has half that, okay?

278
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:36,229
What's with the extra panel?

279
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:39,691
- What are you, Thomas Edison?
- Asked a bunch of electricians.

280
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:43,403
They have their own chat rooms,
all they talked about was wiring.

281
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,990
Freaking Internet.
Find anything on it these days.

282
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,951
What do you say?
Pop over, have another look-see?

283
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,537
Listen.

284
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:57,751
I think we possibly have a lead
on something.

285
00:22:57,917 --> 00:23:00,253
- Yeah?
- I have this guy down at the office.

286
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,672
He says he has some kind of information.

287
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:07,093
The thing is, he'll only give it to you,
in person.

288
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:14,142
Okay.

289
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:16,811
- Do you remember Hector Salamanca?
- Yeah.

290
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:20,732
The old cripple guy with the bell?
Rather crap than talk to us?

291
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:24,319
- No, I don't remember him at all. Why?
- Well, he's the guy.

292
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:28,990
His nurse calls us,
says he wants to powwow.

293
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:31,951
So we have this guy at the office
for three hours.

294
00:23:32,118 --> 00:23:34,578
And he still just wants to talk to you.

295
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:38,875
Do not even think about going down there.

296
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,753
- Marie...
- This is clearly a ploy or a trick,

297
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,174
or something designed to get Hank
out into the open. That's all this is.

298
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:48,551
- Well, that's what we thought.
- Well...

299
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:51,262
It's been years
since this guy's been a player.

300
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:53,597
His nephew's gone, doesn't have anybody.

301
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:56,351
The nurse checks out, don't know nothing.

302
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:59,479
Guess I just don't see an angle here

303
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,356
if there even is one.

304
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:04,234
Of course,
if you did wanna talk to this guy

305
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,653
there's no safer place than the office.

306
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,697
I don't think this sounds
like a good idea.

307
00:24:09,864 --> 00:24:11,282
Yeah. I agree, Uncle Hank.

308
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:13,660
It is a ridiculous idea.

309
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:18,164
And there's no way
that you're going to do it. End of story.

310
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,625
Hank, thanks for coming down.

311
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,128
No problem at all.

312
00:24:23,294 --> 00:24:25,130
Good to see you, sir.

313
00:24:34,722 --> 00:24:39,018
So, Mr. Salamanca,
you got something you wanna tell me?

314
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:51,948
A, E, I, O...

315
00:24:52,323 --> 00:24:56,660
Row O. P, Q, R, S...

316
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,580
First letter S.

317
00:24:58,746 --> 00:25:04,252
A, E, I, O, U...

318
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:05,962
Second letter U.

319
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:07,881
A...

320
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:10,717
B, C...

321
00:25:12,218 --> 00:25:15,138
A, E, I...

322
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,807
J, K...

323
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:21,895
A, E, I...

324
00:25:22,061 --> 00:25:26,399
J, K, L, M...

325
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:31,988
A, E, I, O, U...

326
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:37,327
Row U. V, W, X, Y...

327
00:25:37,493 --> 00:25:38,870
All right. That's enough.

328
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:42,957
Thank you.

329
00:25:44,792 --> 00:25:47,045
Yeah, thanks. I can spell.

330
00:25:47,503 --> 00:25:51,007
Well, you got that out
of your system now?

331
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:53,676
Should we try this one more time?

332
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:02,393
A, E... F...

333
00:26:03,811 --> 00:26:09,567
A, E, I, O, U...

334
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,737
A...

335
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,907
B, C...

336
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,826
Yeah, we got it.

337
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:23,122
I am... I am... I am just so, so sorry.

338
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:34,342
Well, at least this time,
he didn't shit himself.

339
00:26:35,718 --> 00:26:37,845
I guess that's progress.

340
00:27:05,789 --> 00:27:08,418
<i>- Yes?</i>
- We may have a problem.

341
00:27:08,584 --> 00:27:10,086
I've got eyes on the DEA.

342
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:12,714
<i>They just had a visitor.</i>

343
00:27:13,881 --> 00:27:16,676
<i>Hector Salamanca.</i>

344
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:29,147
I don't know what to say to you now.

345
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:33,651
Sit here and think about how far that
kind of behavior is gonna get you.

346
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,237
Not far, let me tell you.

347
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:51,586
Any second thoughts?

348
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:56,299
Then let's get to work.

349
00:30:09,932 --> 00:30:11,684
Hello.

350
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,022
Hi.

351
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,905
Hi.

352
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,908
Hello.

353
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,869
Hi.

354
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,409
Mr. Pinkman

355
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:11,411
you're free to go.

356
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,539
Why? What happened?

357
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,332
Tox screen came back.

358
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:18,668
No ricin poisoning.

359
00:31:21,003 --> 00:31:23,131
Surprised, huh?

360
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,759
No, why should I be?

361
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,594
Your jacket.

362
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,267
Till we meet again.

363
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,023
Okay. Okay.

364
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:44,277
Hey, yo. Yo, right here.

365
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:51,242
Hey, Andrea.

366
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,870
I'm just checking on Brock.

367
00:31:54,036 --> 00:31:57,415
Hey, it sounds like...

368
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,710
I mean, listen,
just call me if you can, all right?

369
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:04,672
- I'm heading back over. All right.
- Hey, excuse me.

370
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:23,858
Yes.

371
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:27,487
<i>We just picked up Pinkman.
No witnesses.</i>

372
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,073
What about Hector?

373
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,910
I've checked inside and out

374
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:38,122
no wires, no camera, no surveillance.

375
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:41,667
Police cruiser rolled through
an hour ago. Seemed routine.

376
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:44,879
<i>It's just him, alone in his room.</i>

377
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,218
All right.

378
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,179
I'm on my way.

379
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:58,059
Maybe it's better if I do this myself.

380
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:00,853
I do this.

381
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:45,750
<i>It's all clear.</i>

382
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,049
Wait here.

383
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:06,205
What kind of man talks to the DEA?

384
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:09,542
No man.

385
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:12,878
No man at all.

386
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,463
A crippled little <i>rata.</i>

387
00:36:55,629 --> 00:36:58,924
What a reputation to leave behind.

388
00:37:12,229 --> 00:37:14,523
Is that how you want to be remembered?

389
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,655
Last chance to look at me, Hector.

390
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:59,151
Oh, my...

391
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,320
All right, all right.

392
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,865
- Let's get going.
- Oh, Jesus.

393
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:06,742
Oh, Jesus.

394
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:11,539
Why don't we start evacuating?

395
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:15,668
- Start evacuation on the south side.
- Call Security.

396
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,795
Everyone outside right now.

397
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:24,509
<i>- -in the same boat for sure.
- But it's that time again...</i>

398
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,804
<i>...where we tell you
about your own hell...</i>

399
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:30,391
<i>...Albuquerque afternoon commute.
How bad are things out there?</i>

400
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:34,562
<i>I tell you what, right now southbound
25, got an accident at Jefferson.</i>

401
00:38:34,728 --> 00:38:37,398
<i>Make sure you stay to the left
through that area.</i>

402
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:41,443
<i>Things have slowed to a crawl
at the Big I, no surprises there either.</i>

403
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:46,115
<i>Hate to interrupt, I have breaking news.
Now, coming out of the North Valley</i>

404
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:49,118
<i>an explosion has been reported
at a nursing home.</i>

405
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:51,328
<i>- Casa Tranquila nursing home.
- Oh, no.</i>

406
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,582
<i>You heard of that place.
We got few details on it so far.</i>

407
00:38:54,748 --> 00:38:59,628
<i>Unfortunately, initial report is though,
that three people may have been killed.</i>

408
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,755
<i>- Oh, no.
- The news is disturbing.</i>

409
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:04,967
<i>We're gonna get you information
as soon as it comes in.</i>

410
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:08,804
<i>Situation over there is pretty hectic.
What's traffic looking like?</i>

411
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:11,223
<i>If you're moving through that area</i>

412
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:15,060
<i>we're talking about East and
Westbound Paseo, North Valley.</i>

413
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:17,813
<i>Please, avoid that area
as you move through.</i>

414
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:22,401
<i>Our heart's going out to the victims.
We'll bring you details as we get them.</i>

415
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:26,238
<i>Coming up on Coyote 102.5,
Aerosmith, Def Leppard.</i>

416
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:28,991
<i>Keep it right here
on New Mexico's finest rock...</i>

417
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:07,155
You wanna cook with a broken arm?

418
00:40:08,949 --> 00:40:11,159
Next step, CO2.

419
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:12,911
Do it.

420
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,180
Hey.

421
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:34,432
I better hear them click.

422
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:00,208
What, you got a problem with stairs?

423
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:42,208
Gus is dead.

424
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:49,591
We've got work to do.

425
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:38,760
He's gonna pull through.

426
00:44:38,927 --> 00:44:40,428
Yeah?

427
00:44:41,554 --> 00:44:46,101
Yeah. It looked kind of touch-and-go
there for a while,

428
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:48,103
but he's gonna...

429
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:51,189
He's gonna make it.

430
00:44:51,773 --> 00:44:54,025
Oh, thank God.

431
00:44:54,818 --> 00:44:57,028
Oh, thank God.

432
00:45:04,035 --> 00:45:08,832
You know,
still saying it wasn't the ricin.

433
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:13,044
I don't understand.

434
00:45:13,211 --> 00:45:15,046
Then what was it?

435
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:21,094
Saying it was most likely a flower
called lily of the valley.

436
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:23,763
It's, like, common.

437
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:27,517
It's got these red berries on it
that I guess taste sweet,

438
00:45:27,684 --> 00:45:31,187
and sometimes kids eat them
and wind up poisoning themselves.

439
00:45:31,354 --> 00:45:34,399
And that's it, nothing more.

440
00:45:38,194 --> 00:45:42,949
So Gus didn't poison him after all.

441
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:53,293
Still he had to go

442
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:54,961
right?

443
00:45:57,338 --> 00:45:59,132
Damn right.

444
00:45:59,299 --> 00:46:01,426
Gus had to go.

445
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:04,554
Yeah.

446
00:46:10,018 --> 00:46:11,769
You know, I should...

447
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:13,605
I should get back.

448
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,773
Andrea's waiting.

449
00:47:02,779 --> 00:47:05,198
<i>I'm at Casa Tranquila
where three are dead</i>

450
00:47:05,365 --> 00:47:09,202
<i>following an explosion
that rocked this facility earlier today.</i>

451
00:47:09,369 --> 00:47:12,205
<i>The fireball completely consumed
one resident's room,</i>

452
00:47:12,372 --> 00:47:14,249
<i>and damaged common areas nearby.</i>

453
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:15,458
Walt?

454
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:17,919
Let me get somewhere
where I can hear you.

455
00:47:18,086 --> 00:47:20,964
- Tell him Uncle Hank was right.
- Walt?

456
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:22,298
<i>How you doing?</i>

457
00:47:22,465 --> 00:47:24,550
How am I doing? How are you doing?

458
00:47:24,926 --> 00:47:26,469
I'm...

459
00:47:29,055 --> 00:47:31,224
I'm doing quite well.

460
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:34,394
<i>I'm good.</i>

461
00:47:34,936 --> 00:47:37,480
Jesus, Walt, the news here.

462
00:47:37,647 --> 00:47:39,190
Gus Fring is dead.

463
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:43,236
<i>He was blown up with some person
from some Mexican cartel,</i>

464
00:47:43,403 --> 00:47:46,239
<i>and the DEA has no idea
what to make of it.</i>

465
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,367
Do you know about this?

466
00:47:49,951 --> 00:47:53,746
<i>- Walt? I need you to...</i>
- It's over.

467
00:47:53,997 --> 00:47:55,373
We're safe.

468
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:58,042
<i>...might've heard a rumbling sound...</i>

469
00:47:58,209 --> 00:48:02,005
<i>...and another reported a, quote,
"ringing" in the moments just prior.</i>

470
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:04,424
<i>Administrators at Casa Tranquila advise</i>

471
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:09,178
<i>that if you do have loved ones
in their care, please do not call in...</i>

472
00:48:09,345 --> 00:48:11,264
Was this you?

473
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:15,768
<i>What happened?</i>

474
00:48:17,312 --> 00:48:19,063
I won.
