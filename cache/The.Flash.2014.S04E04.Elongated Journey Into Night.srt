00:39:31,906 --> 00:39:35,908
- I fixed up your office.
- Sweet fancy Moses.

991
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:38,310
Thanks for screwing
up my insurance claim.

992
00:39:38,312 --> 00:39:40,146
No payout, no mayor money.

993
00:39:40,148 --> 00:39:41,647
I gotta pick up a case soon.

994
00:39:41,649 --> 00:39:44,180
What if I had a job for you?

995
00:39:44,183 --> 00:39:46,016
I wanna laugh really hard right now,

996
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:48,253
but I'm afraid my face
will fall off again.

997
00:39:48,256 --> 00:39:49,955
I can't change what has happened

998
00:39:49,957 --> 00:39:51,219
between us in the past,

999
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,659
but I can offer you a
chance to change what happens

1000
00:39:53,661 --> 00:39:55,961
- in our future.
- How?

1001
00:39:55,963 --> 00:39:58,704
Let my team and I study your powers,

1002
00:39:58,707 --> 00:40:02,534
figure out how to improve them,
see what your limitations are.

1003
00:40:02,537 --> 00:40:04,477
And let me train you.

1004
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,810
Train me? For what?

1005
00:40:06,813 --> 00:40:09,213
To do what I do.

1006
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,985
To be a detective again, Ralph.

1007
00:40:11,988 --> 00:40:14,512
A real one. Like,
it's not gonna be easy.

1008
00:40:14,515 --> 00:40:15,891
I'm gonna push you to your limit.

1009
00:40:15,894 --> 00:40:18,196
I think it's safe to say some
days you're gonna hate me.

1010
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:20,566
Allen, it's safe to say
that I always hate you.

1011

1012
00:40:21,566 --> 00:40:24,235
Do I get a cool super hero name?

1013
00:40:24,238 --> 00:40:26,860
What do you think about... Plastic Man?

1014
00:40:26,863 --> 00:40:28,980
I think that's the dumbest
name I've ever heard of.

1015
00:40:28,983 --> 00:40:30,462
Yeah, Cisco comes up with the names.

1016
00:40:30,465 --> 00:40:31,821
It's better that way.

1017
00:40:31,824 --> 00:40:33,357
What do you say?

1018
00:40:44,023 --> 00:40:47,191
There's just one thing I gotta ask you.

1019
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:50,195
What made you look into Mayor
Bellows in the first place?

1020
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:52,469
Oh, it was a client. Asked
me to follow the Mayor.

1021
00:40:52,472 --> 00:40:54,883
Never met him, though. He did
everything over the phone.

1022
00:40:54,886 --> 00:40:55,954
Who was it?

1023
00:40:55,957 --> 00:40:57,824
Only gave me his last name.

1024
00:40:57,827 --> 00:40:59,760
DeVoe.

1025

<i>You and I have been enemies for years.</i>

1026
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:05,204
Oh, you've had others, of course.

1027
00:41:05,207 --> 00:41:08,071
There's Thawne. Zoom. DeVoe.

1028
00:41:08,074 --> 00:41:11,342
This is where we came up
with the cerebral inhibitor

1029
00:41:11,345 --> 00:41:13,876
to use against DeVoe.

What's wrong? The name DeVoe

00:41:17,426 --> 00:41:19,043
mean something to you?
