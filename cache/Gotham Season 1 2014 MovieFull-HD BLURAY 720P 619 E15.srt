But he could be quiet too. Somber.

159

She died six or seven years ago.

- Does this mean something to you?

165
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:16,371
These victims,
were they missing their adrenal glands?

166

How'd you know that?

167
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,726
This was an academic paper
Gerald wrote a few months ago.

168
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,251
He asked me to proof it.

169
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,209
See, Gerald had a theory that fear
was an evolutionary flaw in humans.

170
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:36,530
That war, rape, theft, murder,
it was all caused by fear.

171
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,767
He was obsessed with it.

172
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,209
So Crane killed these people
and took their glands to test a theory?

173
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,961
No. Gerald wasn't trying to prove
he was right about fear.

174
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,922
He was trying to cure himself of it.

175
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,169
Crane's idea of curing fear
was to inoculate himself against it.

176
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,566
- Like a disease?
- Exactly.

177
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:56,651
In order to do so, he needed a condensed
source of the hormones that cause fear.

178
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,446
- Phobics.
- Crane's preying on them?

179
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,204
Spiking their fear by scaring them and then
killing them in order to harvest hormones.

pleasure to see you.

476
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:31,881
Look at you. From the trunk of my car
to running your own club.

477
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,445
The place looks good, Penguin.

478
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,641
Hell of a turnout.

479
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,080
[MEN CHUCKLE]

480
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,327
MAN:
Yeah.

481
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:42,326
How about a table? Drinks?
My compliments, of course.

482
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,969
Expensive stuff. Let me see.

483
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,810
I had a little chat with Falcone.

484
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,245
I came here to let you know
that all is kosher between us.

485
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:03,002
As long as you don't go giving Falcone
any more of my secrets.

486
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,890
No.

487
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,366
Nothing like that.

488
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,040
Of course not. Grab a glass.

489
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:17,326
You better hope that old man Falcone
lives a long life.

490
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:22,361
Because the second he's out of the picture,
so are you.

491
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,969
Master B.

492
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,448
Sunrise.

493
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,201
Oh, hey. How are you?
I heard your suspect was killed.

494
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,483
He came after Harvey and me with a gun.
We didn't have a choice.

495
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,763
I'm so sorry. What about his son?

496
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:23,684
Paramedics were able to stabilize him.

497
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,082
I'm heading to the hospital
to check in on him.

498
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,769
- Well, let me know how he is.
- I will.

499
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,050
So all settled in here, huh?

500
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,328
Uh, almost.

501
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:39,650
- Think you're gonna like it here?
- I do, so far.

502
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,645
Good.

503
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,727
Um, I have tickets to the circus.
Do you wanna come with me?

504
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,491
- A circus?
- Yeah, they're good.

505
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,524
No, uh, sad elephants. Heh.

506
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:58,609
Circus, sure. Why not. Look, Lee...

507
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,526
Um...

508
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,167
No kissing here on the job, okay?
I'm serious.

509
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:10,204
"Okay" Okay?

510
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,051
If your hardass reputation
is worth that much to you.

511
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,686
- This is a place of work.
- Cops have feelings too.

512
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:20,647
- It's not unprofessional to show feelings.
- Yeah, it is. Those kinds of feelings. Yeah.

513
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:23,164
Fine. Be that way.

514
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,081
<i>Hey-

515
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,047
I'm just joking. I'll be discreet.

516
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,487
All right, everyone, gather around.

517
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:48,080
Up until now, there's
been no order in here.

518
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:53,088
No structure.

519
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,161
Things are gonna change.

520
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,566
MAN:
She's back.

521
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,609
MY eyes.

522
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,929
They took my eyes.

523
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,444
The boy received a massive dose
of condensed hormones.

524
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:44,961
Cortisol, adrenalin and another compound
we're still trying to identify.

525
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,322
The combination nearly killed him.

526
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,883
But he's gonna live?

527
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,607
Yes.

528
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,407
But we ran a CAT scan in order to
determine if he suffered any brain damage.

529
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:58,444
The results, we've never seen
anything like them before.

530
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,641
The hormones themselves
have long since worn off.

531
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:05,128
But the effects, they seem to be lingering.

532
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:08,167
What are you saying?
That he's still in fear?

533
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,964
Well, not just fear.

534
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,290
Jonathan's brain activity shows
he's in a constant state of intense terror.

535
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:19,725
- How long until this goes away?
- Well, that's just the thing, detective.

536
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,924
We can't be certain it ever will.

537
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,329
Imagine the thing
you fear most in the world.

538
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,526
Imagine that's all you see.

539
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,722
Every waking hour.

540
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,411
JONATHAN:
No.No.No.

541
00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:58,485
