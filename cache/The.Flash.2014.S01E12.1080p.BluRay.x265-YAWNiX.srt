1
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:06,507
My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:10,761
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,972
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:17,351
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

5
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,812
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:25,484
but secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:30,155
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,157
I am the Flash.

9
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:34,993
Previously on The Flash:

10
00:00:35,202 --> 00:00:39,748
Cisco, if you don't seal off the blast, people
in this building will die, including Caitlin.

11
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:42,376
- Don't look for me again.
- Ronnie's alive.

12
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,836
And he's out there, alone and scared.

13
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:48,715
Hartley Rathaway. One of the finest
scientific minds I've ever encountered.

14
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:51,635
Can't imagine how
you're gonna feel when you let me out.

15
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,637
Why would I ever do that?

16
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:56,515
Because I know where Ronnie Raymond is.

17
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,567
Honey. Honey.

18
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:10,153
Dana. Oh, God. Someone...

19
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:12,322
- Help!
- Please help us.

20
00:01:15,284 --> 00:01:17,494
- Help!
- Help us, please!

21
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:23,750
Get the power to that line shut down.
You guys, lay down the hose line.

22
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:26,211
- Help! Help!
- Help us.

23
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,171
- We're wasting time.
- Help!

24
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,756
Hold on.

25
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,680
Stay here, all right?

26
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:38,056
I got you.

27
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,020
Hey.

28
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,022
No.

29
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,065
My wife!

30
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,071
Dana!

31
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,701
Everyone, back away.

32
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,667
How did...?

33
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:08,462
I love you.

34
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,591
Thank you, Flash.

35
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:23,894
Dude, that was insane.

36
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:28,565
I mean, even I'm having a hard time
getting mad at you for dirtying up my suit.

37
00:02:28,774 --> 00:02:30,651
When are we gonna consider it my suit?

38
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,987
- I'd be comfortable calling it our suit.
- Okay. Our suit.

39
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,907
Tonight was the fastest you've ever run.

40
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:41,161
Yes, your training is paying off. That
couple is alive tonight because of you.

41
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,288
I can still get faster. I know I can.

42
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:49,002
And you will one day. But for today,
I'd say you fulfilled your saved quota.

43
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:52,214
Proper rest is what you need, as do we all.

44
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:56,551
Better yet, what we all need is
a proper drink. Who's up for a round?

45
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,932
Dude, it's movie night with Joe. I can't.
But I'll see you guys tomorrow, all right?

46
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,642
- Bye.
- Night.

47
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,269
What about you? Drinks on me?

48
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,188
I think I'll pass.

49
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,149
You okay?

50
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:17,155
I was looking for my tablet
at your workstation, and I found this.

51
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:23,870
You said we should stop looking for Ronnie,
so I didn't stop looking for Ronnie.

52
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,247
Why?

53
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,458
Hartley, he said he knew
what happened to Ronnie.

54
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,836
Hartley Rathaway?
Who is currently locked up...

55
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,672
in our villain jail for going psycho
with sound waves?

56
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,466
Yeah, he's made some poor choices.
No argument there.

57
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:39,845
- But I looked into what he was saying and...
- Cisco, Ronnie's gone.

58
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,639
And it's time for me
to move on with my life.

59
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:45,851
Doesn't seem like it.

60
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,854
What's that supposed to mean?

61
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:52,649
Look, I'm not an expert on love.

62
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:56,695
But I think in order to move on
from Ronnie...

63
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,948
you actually have to move on.

64
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:50,832
Breach, level two.

65
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:56,171
Hold it right there!

66
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:03,553
Shawna?

67
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:05,180
There she is. Get her.

68
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:11,061
- Crazy cool, right?
- How did you do that?

69
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,312
Grab my hand.

70
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:27,869
- How the hell, Shawna?
- So you like?

71
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,579
Oh, I love.

72
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,587
Whoo!

73
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,553
Hey.

74
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,556
The security cameras
in half the prison are shut down.

75
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:53,645
Then Clay Parker, according to this log, who
was locked in his cell, somehow vanishes.

76
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,564
Not completely.

77
00:05:57,107 --> 00:06:00,652
- What's that?
- It's a kind of organic particulate residual.

78
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:05,115
I found it on the floor in here,
just outside the cell, out in the hallway.

79
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,367
The trail led me all the way outside.

80
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:12,581
Dad.

81
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:29,222
So word around here is
Parker pulled a Shawshank?

82
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:33,935
Yep. And none of the other prisoners
heard or saw anything.

83
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,605
They wouldn't talk to you about it.

84
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:39,774
Leaves us with not a lot to go on.

85
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:44,779
Well, if there's anyone who could figure out
how Parker got out of here, it's you, son.

86
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:49,200
- Come on, Allen. Let's go.
- Duty calls.

87
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,338
So my dad just happened to come by?

88
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,548
The guard owed me a favor.

89
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,801
Thank you.

90
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:17,687
Thanks for getting
me out of that hell hole.

91
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,689
You would have done the same, right?

92
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,608
So...

93
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:26,947
- how the hell did this happen to you?
- Don't know.

94
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:30,533
After you got locked up,
I started not feeling right.

95
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:34,412
I was passing out for no reason.
Waking up in odd places.

96
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:37,374
Took me a while before I could control it.

97
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,418
As soon as I could...

98
00:07:43,088 --> 00:07:44,464
I came for you.

99
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:48,385
So you can just jump wherever you want?

100
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:52,263
If I can see where I'm going.
We got a second chance, Clay.

101
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:57,268
We can leave Central City.
Do all the things we talked about.

102
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,523
I can't leave yet, baby.

103
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,943
I owe Marcus a lot of money.

104
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:08,363
I skip town before paying him back,
he'll find us.

105
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,658
But with what you can do...

106
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:15,078
we can pay off that debt.

107
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,499
Then we'll be free
and we can go anywhere in the world.

108
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,543
Together.

109
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:32,303
Not even Barry's cells move this fast.
I've never seen anything like it.

110
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,264
So Clay Parker is a metahuman?

111
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:38,685
Not so fast. The particulate
residue that Barry gathered...

112
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:43,857
at Iron Heights does contain Clay
Parker's DNA but also DNA of a woman.

113
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:47,569
Run her DNA against the C.C.P.D.
criminal database. See if you get a match.

114
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,826
Yahtzee. Her name's Shawna Baez.

115
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:58,705
Mostly petty crimes,
and this girl likes to party, apparently.

116
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,999
A long list of disorderly conducts at bars.

117
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,460
So I'm guessing we find her,
we find Clay Parker.

118
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,128
- Barry?
- Yeah.

119
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:08,590
In the meantime, let's track
these particulates and see how they work.

120
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,718
I'll be right with you guys.

121
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:21,061
I have had the biggest
craving for Thai food.

122
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:23,605
You said you knew
what happened to Ronnie.

123
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,607
And how he was still alive.

124
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:29,861
And you said Professor Stein was at
S.T.A.R. Labs the night of the explosion.

125
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,489
Yes, he was.

126
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,116
Why?

127
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:42,957
The mystery isn't why Stein
went to S.T.A.R. Labs that night.

128
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,460
It's why he didn't leave.

129
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:50,465
- Tell me.
- Can't. Have to show you.

130
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,595
You are not getting out of this cell.

131
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,432
Fair enough. But I know you, Cisco.

132
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:04,062
I know how much you looked up to Ronnie.
He was like family.

133
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,482
The family you built for yourself here.

134
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,568
I know how much
you wanna see that family healed.

135
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,320
Let me help you.

136
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:14,614
I don't believe you.

137
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:18,326
I'm telling you the truth, Cisco.

138
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:23,039
When you are ready,
you know where to find me.

139
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:39,764
What's that smile about?

140
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,683
I saw my dad today.

141
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:45,937
No glass. No phones. Just me
and him face-to-face. Joe arranged it.

142
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:49,732
- That must have been amazing, Barry.
- Yeah. I really needed it.

143
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:52,443
I'm sure he needed it too.

144
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:55,321
Were you there investigating the breakout?

145
00:10:55,780 --> 00:11:00,201
- Mm-hm.
- That is a big story which I am not a part of.

146
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,663
My editor wants me writing
about the Flash and only the Flash.

147
00:11:03,872 --> 00:11:05,498
- Is that a bad thing?
- I don't know.

148
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:08,543
I would like to be thought of
as more than the Flash PR flack.

149
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:12,463
I mean, if I don't write something soon,
I think I might lose my job.

150
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:17,093
Hey, we will find you a great story
to write about. Together.

151
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:20,180
Okay? You know I'm always here for you.

152
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,100
I know.

153
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,151
I didn't know you enjoyed
a bit of rough trade.

154
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:36,905
If I'm gonna let you out,
I'm not taking any chances.

155
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:43,161
Curiosity's a maddening thing, is it not?

156
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:49,334
What do you mean,
you've been asking around?

157
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,086
Do you know a Marcus Stockheimer?

158
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,550
Sure. He's some midlevel gangster.
Works mainly on the south side.

159
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:00,428
Word is Clay Parker
was a runner for Marcus.

160
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:05,225
When Clay got pinched, Marcus lost a lot of
money. Marcus doesn't like losing money.

161
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:09,354
So Parker can't leave Central City
until he's paid off his debt?

162
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:13,358
From what I'm told, if you're a member
of the Stockheimer crew, you get out...

163
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,946
first thing you do is pay them a visit
or suffer the consequences.

164
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,532
All right. No more playing cop.

165
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,577
Promise me.

166
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,704
I hear you.

167
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:28,831
All right.

168
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:38,591
You were gonna show me what happened
to Ronnie. Ronnie died inside the building.

169
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,136
- What are we doing out here?
- What do you see?

170
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:45,348
I don't know.

171
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:49,269
Buildings. Walls. Dirt.

172
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:54,190
Wells would be so disappointed
in your observational skills. Look again.

173
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:03,950
It's Japanese.

174
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:07,954
How can you speak six languages
and sound like a dick in every one of them?

175
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:10,081
It means "bomb shadow."

176
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:14,377
They found these all over Hiroshima
after the first atomic bomb was dropped.

177
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:18,089
This shadow belonged to Martin Stein.

178
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,093
The accelerator explosion did this to him?

179
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:27,390
You really don't see it, do you? You're gonna
gonna kick yourself when you figure it out.

180
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:32,812
Oh, man. You were full of it then,
and you're full of it now.

181
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:36,858
This is another one of your lame tricks.
We're going back into the pipeline.

182
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,298
You're not the only one
who understands vibrations, Hartley.

183
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,133
Those cochlear devices you're wearing...

184
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:05,803
- I've made a few adjustments.
- No. Please, don't.

185
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:11,642
If you know how to find Ronnie,
then you better tell me. Right now.

186
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,979
Please. Make it stop.
Please. I'll show you. I'll show... Aah!

187
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:21,819
Try that again,
and I won't make it stop. Ever.

188
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:25,740
I'm impressed.
Didn't think you had that in you.

189
00:14:28,326 --> 00:14:31,162
You have to take these off
if you want to find out the truth.

190
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:33,706
And why is that?

191
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:37,168
It will look a little conspicuous
where we're going next.

192
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:45,385
Mm. I was analyzing the particulates that
Clay Parker and Shawna Baez left behind.

193
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,220
I found something very interesting.

194
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:51,974
When Clay's cells come into contact
with Shawna's, they adopt her properties.

195
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:57,063
Something bothering you?

196
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,524
Why would you ask that?

197
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:03,486
You're doing that biting-your-lower-lip
thing you do when something's bothering you.

198
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,321
Ahem. I'm fine.

199
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,073
Okay.

200
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,242
Cisco says I don't have a life.

201
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:13,246
- You don't, do you?
- I do.

202
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:15,415
I cook and I eat.

203
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:19,877
And I read and I help you.

204
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:24,424
So, what you're saying is you do everything
that has nothing to do with having a life.

205
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,759
You don't have to be rude about it.

206
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:29,303
Ha, ha.
Hey, I'm not doing any better than you.

207
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:33,224
My social life consists of running
at superhuman speed and Netflix.

208
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,476
We are quite the pair, Mr. Allen.

209
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,770
Yes, we are, Dr. Snow.

210
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:43,818
There's an armed robbery in progress. Two
suspects. Male and female. In their 20s.

211
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,946
Sounds like our metahuman
Bonnie and Clyde are at it again.

212
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:49,073
Time to ruin their social life.

213
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:59,333
Just a few bags, baby.
Enough to pay back Marcus.

214
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:02,837
These things are heavier than they look.

215
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:18,186
Oh, I've read about you. You're the Flash.

216
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,689
I've heard you're real fast.

217
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,151
Let's see if it's true.

218
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:28,154
Catch me if you can.

219
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:30,865
I can. Unh!

220
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,577
You've gotta be kidding me.

221
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,587
Not too many men can keep up with me.

222
00:16:44,611 --> 00:16:46,611
:::::: www.hiqve.com ::::::

223
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:15,993
This is a bullet wound.
You're lucky it just barely broke the skin.

224
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:18,496
Guess I'm a lot faster
than a speeding bullet.

225
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:24,043
Shawna Baez. She can teleport.

226
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,046
As in, "Beam me up, Shawna"?

227
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:29,840
Yes. Of course. Quantum entanglement.

228
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:34,887
The ability to manipulate interconnected
particles over an infinite distance.

229
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:38,558
Or as Einstein put it,
"Spooky action at a distance."

230
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:43,187
Every time I got close, she'd disappear.
It was like we were playing a game of...

231
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:46,357
Peek-a-Boo. Come on, can't I name one?

232
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,902
How can I catch her
if I don't know where she's gonna be?

233
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:53,781
Everybody has limits, Mr. Allen.
Now that we know Shawna's powers...

234
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,700
we'll focus on those limits.

235
00:17:56,284 --> 00:18:01,414
All right. Let me know.
I'm gonna change. I gotta go help Iris.

236
00:18:08,379 --> 00:18:09,672
- Hey, Barry.
- Hey, Eddie.

237
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,173
Hey, what are you doing here?

238
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:14,010
I thought I'd see if you wanted help
writing your story.

239
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:19,056
That is so sweet. I would love to, but we're
going to dinner with Eddie's mom tonight.

240
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:21,892
- And we're late.
- Can we do it another time?

241
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,311
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

242
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,104
- Great.
- All right.

243
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:27,106
- Bye.
- See you.

244
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:44,081
- Hey.
- What bars did Shawna and Clay frequent?

245
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:47,710
Uh, mostly south-side dive bars. Why?

246
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:52,048
I was just gonna check them out.
See if they fall into any old habits.

247
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:56,052
It's a good idea. I'll join you.

248
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,892
Everyone's wonderin'

249
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:06,771
Will you come out tonight?

250
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:10,608
Everyone's trying to get it right.

251
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:11,817
Get it right.

252
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,444
Hey.

253
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,279
What?

254
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:18,324
What? Nothing. Uh, you look...

255
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:20,201
really nice.

256
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,162
I don't always dress
like a high school principal.

257
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:27,875
So this is where Shawna Baez
and Clay Parker used to hang out.

258
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,960
It is, according to the files.

259
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,922
I thought we could kill two birds
with one stone.

260
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,758
Look for them
and get ourselves back out there.

261
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,929
You want a piece of my heart?

262
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:41,722
I keep making the same mistake.

263
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:45,226
Every time Iris falls,
I race to pick her up, thinking...

264
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:48,521
that one of these times,
things are gonna change.

265
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:53,984
But things are never gonna change.
I am just destined to be just a friend.

266
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:59,573
You're not pining for someone who burst
into flames and wants nothing of you.

267
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:05,287
What is wrong with us? We're in our 20s.

268
00:20:05,496 --> 00:20:09,792
We should be having fun.
We should meet people. Go on lots of dates.

269
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:14,088
Well, here's to liquid courage.

270
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:19,427
Uh... That is very fast.

271
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,847
- You drank all of it.
- Excuse me.

272
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,766
I would like to start a tab.

273
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:28,894
Okay.

274
00:20:31,522 --> 00:20:35,067
C.C.P.D. confiscated everything
from S.T.A.R. Labs after the explosion.

275
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:37,027
Video. Audio. Traffic-cam footage.

276
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,863
Okay. So?

277
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:43,743
I saw Martin Stein the night S.T.A.R. Labs
went boom. He walked right past me.

278
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:47,913
You see, Stein
specialized in transmutation.

279
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:50,916
Molecular transmography.
Quantum splicing.

280
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:55,379
Taking two things and making them one.

281
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:59,049
Let's go to the videotape, shall we?

282
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,344
Okay, stop.

283
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:04,597
Now zoom in a few clicks.

284
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,559
Now advance it frame by frame.

285
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,232
His eyes.

286
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,985
They turned to white just like Ronnie's.

287
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,864
Now stop. There. In the mass of energy.

288
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,617
- Looks like...
- Ronnie.

289
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:26,368
And Professor Stein.

290
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:30,206
The dark matter merged them together.

291
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:33,125
Explains why Ronnie hasn't
seemed quite himself lately.

292
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:36,086
It's because he's not.

293
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:38,798
He's Martin Stein.

294
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:47,306
You can't say I didn't keep up
my end of the bargain.

295
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:57,441
I figure that makes us even-steven.

296
00:21:57,608 --> 00:21:59,026
Adios.

297
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,947
Uh, excuse me. Could I get some water?

298
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:09,161
- Yo. Excuse me. For real?
- Mr. Barry Allen!

299
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:10,621
Come on down.

300
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:13,123
Or up. Come up here with me.

301
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,709
Oh, come show them what you got.
Come on.

302
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:18,796
Barry. Barry. Barry.

303
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:22,258
Barry. Barry. Barry.

304
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:25,553
Barry. Barry. Barry.

305
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,472
Look at him go. He's so fast. Ooh, shh.

306
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:31,684
I'm not much of a singer.
And you're not much of a drinker.

307
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,687
We are gonna bring this place down.

308
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,814
Okay. Just... Good girl.

309
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,903
Get ready.

310
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:47,658
Summer lovin' Had me a blast.

311
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:51,829
Summer lovin' Happened so fast

312
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:56,000
I met a girl crazy for me

313
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,836
I met a boy cute as can be.

314
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:02,923
Summer days driftin' away.

315
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,342
To, uh, oh, those summer nights.

316
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,177
Well-a, well-a, well-a, unh.

317
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:12,182
You're fast and you can sing?
What can't you do?

318
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,393
Stop you from drinking, apparently.

319
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:17,104
I'm not even sure that was mine.

320
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,858
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- Okay.

321
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:25,195
All right. Can I close out my tab, please?

322
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:29,867
Hey, Stevie. Can my friend here tap out?

323
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,785
Sure thing, Linda.

324
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,247
Uh, thank you, Linda.

325
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:38,459
You're welcome, Barry.

326
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:42,004
How do you know my name?

327
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:45,257
Barry. Barry. Barry.

328
00:23:45,466 --> 00:23:49,261
Yeah. Uh, sorry about us up there.

329
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,596
Are you kidding?

330
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:54,475
No, that was some of the best singing
that I've heard come from that stage.

331
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:56,936
You definitely made my ears happy.
Don't worry.

332
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,604
Thanks.

333
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:04,318
So, uh, was that your girlfriend up there?

334
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:08,405
Oh, uh, no. No. She's a friend.

335
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,366
Okay.

336
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:14,703
Reel me in so our love can begin again.

337
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:18,874
Hey, have you heard of this new phone app?
It's so cool.

338
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:22,294
Check it out. You just touch
someone's phone with your phone...

339
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:24,380
and it downloads your contact info.

340
00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:26,757
Wow. That is cool.

341
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:32,054
See? You have my number.

342
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:37,768
What you do with it now is up to you.

343
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:40,062
Okay.

344
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:43,065
- Barry, I don't feel good.
- Yeah?

345
00:24:43,691 --> 00:24:45,693
Okay. Come on.

346
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:50,656
You okay?

347
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:01,041
It's 80 grand. What I owe.

348
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:03,836
So are we square now?

349
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:06,964
Almost.

350
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:19,977
Heh, heh, oh.

351
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:22,604
Holy crap.

352
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:26,025
Glad you're impressed.
So are we cool now?

353
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:29,486
Absolutely. Couldn't be cooler.

354
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:33,615
Which is why I think we need
to keep working together.

355
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:39,496
With what I know and what you could do...

356
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:43,042
oh, we could be
looking at a very lucrative future.

357
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,716
Police. Everybody down.

358
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:04,605
No. Baby. Oh, no.

359
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:07,775
Hold it right there.

360
00:26:13,864 --> 00:26:15,491
Damn.

361
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:26,502
Are we still running?

362
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,712
No, we are here.

363
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:32,549
Ugh. Vodka and super speed.
Not a good combination.

364
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,802
Ha, ha. Come on.

365
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,679
So are you gonna call her?

366
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:39,389
Who?

367
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:43,393
That girl.
The one who gave you her number.

368
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,479
I hadn't really thought about it.

369
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,898
Yes, you have.

370
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,692
But I know you. You won't.

371
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:53,362
You'll let her slip
right through your fingers...

372
00:26:53,529 --> 00:26:56,406
because you think
you don't deserve happiness.

373
00:26:56,573 --> 00:27:02,162
But what you don't realize is you need
a little saving too.

374
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,581
Little help, please.

375
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,000
Yeah. Okay.

376
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:14,424
There you go again.
Saving me from that evil dress.

377
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:15,843
Get in bed.

378
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:19,429
Did you sneak a peek at my goods?

379
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:23,684
Heh. I wouldn't be much of a hero if I did.

380
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:26,478
Yeah, but it's okay if you peeked a little.

381
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:29,690
You deserve a peek
for all the good stuff you do.

382
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:33,485
Drink lots of water.

383
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,696
Thank you for tonight.

384
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:37,364
I sang.

385
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,992
Anytime.

386
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,494
Hey, Barry?

387
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:45,497
Will you stay with me until I fall asleep?

388
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,375
Sure. Yeah.

389
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:02,806
Hi.

390
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:04,641
So loud.

391
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:06,059
Oh.

392
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,520
I just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

393
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:12,566
Let's just say I envy
your inability to get drunk.

394
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,651
I don't remember much from last night.

395
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:18,530
Yeah. That's probably for the best.

396
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,407
Summer lovin'

397
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:22,993
- Oh, God. That I do remember.
- Ha-ha-ha.

398
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,373
What's wrong?

399
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:34,504
Cisco has something he needs to tell you.

400
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:38,050
- Hartley's gone.
- He escaped from the pipeline?

401
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:39,676
How is that even possible?

402
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:43,847
I let him out.

403
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:47,184
Are you mad?
I can't tell with those glasses on.

404
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:51,063
I'd like to yell and wave my arms,
but I'm afraid I'd throw up.

405
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:54,149
Why? What were you thinking?
You know how dangerous he is.

406
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:56,401
Hartley said he knew
what happened to Ronnie.

407
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:59,738
I told you to let it go.
I didn't want you looking into that for me.

408
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:02,199
I wasn't doing it for you. I...

409
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,915
I sealed Ronnie into the accelerator
before it blew.

410
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:16,463
He told me to wait two minutes.
And I waited, but he didn't come back.

411
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:20,467
And I can't stop thinking, 10...

412
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:23,053
20 seconds...

413
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:26,848
and Ronnie
wouldn't be like he is right now.

414
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:30,310
I've wanted to tell you so many times.

415
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:35,315
I'm so sorry.

416
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:38,860
So you carried that around
this whole time?

417
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:46,660
Do you know what Ronnie
would say if he was here?

418
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,621
He would say that you did the right thing.

419
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:55,711
It wasn't your fault. What happened
that night wasn't anybody's fault.

420
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:03,093
Come on.
Don't we have a teleporter to catch?

421
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:07,097
We do have a teleporter to catch.

422
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:11,226
And fortunately,
we do have a promising theory.

423
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:13,437
Take a look at this.

424
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:19,818
Now, this is the normal behavior
of the particulate that Shawna left behind.

425
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:23,196
Watch what happens
when we remove light.

426
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:28,535
Shawna can only become entangled
with something she can see.

427
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:31,747
- Take away her ability to do that...
- She can't teleport.

428
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,040
Exactly.

429
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,917
So we just need to get her into a
dark space. How do we do that?

430
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:41,131
- It's a valid question.
- Hello?

431
00:30:41,757 --> 00:30:43,675
What?

432
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,678
Yeah, I'll be right there. All right.

433
00:30:46,887 --> 00:30:48,430
What's wrong?

434
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:53,143
My dad. He's been stabbed.

435
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:00,150
Dad, what happened?

436
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:07,074
A rather stern reminder, I'd say, not to
poke around Marcus Stockheimer's business.

437
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:11,078
Dad, I told you to stop.

438
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,038
Your dad called me with more intel.

439
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:18,168
It helped us track down
Clay and Shawna and arrest Stockheimer.

440
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:21,922
I managed to screw up
Marcus' big heist too so...

441
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:24,009
You two kept working together
and didn't tell me?

442
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:27,803
It isn't his fault. I did it to help you.

443
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,680
You getting stabbed and beaten
is not helping me.

444
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:38,688
Look, I don't get to feel useful
very much in here.

445
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:44,903
So if I can help you for a change,
I'm gonna want to be there for you.

446
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:49,408
Just like you've been there
for me all these years.

447
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,123
Yeah.

448
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:00,710
You said Marcus
had a big heist coming up?

449
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:01,962
Mm.

450
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:06,007
- Do you know anything else about it?
- Dad. Tell me who did this to you.

451
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:09,511
- It doesn't matter, slugger.
- You said you wanted to, so help me.

452
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,932
One of Marcus' boys.

453
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:15,725
Julius.

454
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:17,727
Okay.

455
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:29,823
What the hell?

456
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,575
Evening, Julius.

457
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:35,871
- How'd I get out here?
- You escaped.

458
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:40,584
When they catch me trying to escape,
they're gonna add five years to my sentence.

459
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,169
Ten, actually.

460
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:46,089
Unless you tell me where
Marcus Stockheimer's next job is gonna be.

461
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:48,633
Whoa.

462
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,052
Guards will be here any second.
I'd start blabbing.

463
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:52,471
Okay.

464
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:54,598
Okay.

465
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:59,352
It's a TDK money transfer truck coming
from the federal reserve bank in St. Louis.

466
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:03,356
Supposed to be millions.
Delivery's around 8.

467
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:06,818
- That's all I know. I swear.
- That's right now.

468
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:08,904
Got eyes on him.

469
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:12,407
Hey! Hey, what about me?

470
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,710
I think we got company.

471
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,298
What the...?

472
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,306
Okay.

473
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:37,891
Let's go.

474
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,030
I got this.

475
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:57,702
Why the hell do you care what we do?
Are you a cop or something?

476
00:33:57,911 --> 00:33:59,538
Something.

477
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,521
Come on.

478
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:46,668
Barry, remember. She cannot teleport if
she cannot see. Limit her field of vision.

479
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,890
No.

480
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,329
He left me.

481
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:38,595
There any way she can teleport out of this?

482
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:42,807
It's impossible. It's one-way glass.
It's mirrored on the inside.

483
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:46,186
No one dangerous is ever
gonna get out of this thing again.

484
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:53,693
Shawna.

485
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:57,280
Clay left you.
He's out there and you're in here.

486
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,783
You know what the crazy thing is?

487
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:02,369
I still love him.

488
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:10,043
Cisco.

489
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,718
Crazy is right.

490
00:36:19,219 --> 00:36:22,430
Some people are worth being crazy for.

491
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:26,935
I'm sorry if I was a bit of a drunken mess
the other night.

492
00:36:27,394 --> 00:36:31,022
- Actually, it was pretty fun.
- Yeah, it was.

493
00:36:31,231 --> 00:36:33,066
You know what?

494
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,860
I think everybody's been right
about you and me.

495
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:40,073
Both of us have been hung up
on people for way too long.

496
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,201
If what Cisco says is true...

497
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:47,163
that Ronnie merged with Martin Stein...

498
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:48,915
then he's not alive anymore.

499
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:55,255
Time for me to move on.
Find someone new to be crazy about.

500
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:06,725
- All right. Well, I'll see you tomorrow.
- Yes. Sure.

501
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,769
- Bye.
- Bye.

502
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,785
That's for you.

503
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:30,039
I thought maybe you could
help me out if you're willing.

504
00:37:32,417 --> 00:37:34,919
This is about the breakout at Iron Heights.

505
00:37:35,128 --> 00:37:38,631
Clay Parker. He's still on the loose.
And we need to catch him.

506
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,592
Why are you giving this to me?

507
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,678
Because you're a good reporter.

508
00:37:44,471 --> 00:37:46,765
And the only one I know.

509
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:52,187
You're not the only one who's fast.

510
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,110
- Hey, what're you doing here?
- Hey.

511
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:01,863
You came to check on me.
That is really sweet...

512
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:05,658
- but I think everything's gonna be okay.
- I'm glad.

513
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:09,829
- I actually am not here to see you.
- No?

514
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:12,207
No. I have a lunch date.

515
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:14,042
- With who?
- Uh...

516
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:15,835
- Ready.
- Hey.

517
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:18,463
Oh, hey. You're our new stringer, right?

518
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:21,382
- Yeah.
- I'm Linda Park. Sports.

519
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:22,801
Iris West.

520
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,969
How did you two meet?

521
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:28,723
- It's actually a funny story.
- I'll tell you later.

522
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,642
- You ready?
- Yeah.

523
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,228
- See you.
- Have fun.

524
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:41,903
So an actual date this time. Good for you.

525
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:45,365
You didn't tell her
your dad's in the slammer?

526
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:49,494
No. I read in a magazine
that that's a big turnoff.

527
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:50,745
Smart.

528
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:55,917
Hey, did you see this?

529
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:58,920
No. I haven't.

530
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:02,215
The Flash.

531
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:08,054
I saw him once in here.

532
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,431
Watched him save Joe's life.

533
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,518
Joe told me about that.
I guess he was lucky.

534
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:14,978
Hmm.

535
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,938
Lucky Joe.

536
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:23,570
Strangest thing.
I get roughed by up Julius, end up in here.

537
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:28,449
Next thing I know, Julius is caught trying
to escape. Claims the Flash broke him out.

538
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:31,870
Won't be seeing Julius for a long time now.

539
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:36,374
Guess I'm lucky too, huh?

540
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,461
Dad.

541
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:44,757
If I was the Flash...

542
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:48,303
don't you think that you'd be the first
to know about it?

543
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,388
Yeah.

544
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,977
Well, if the Flash were my son,
I'd tell him a few things.

545
00:39:56,227 --> 00:40:00,106
First off, I'd tell him
it's a dangerous world, so be careful.

546
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:05,278
Then I'd tell him he's a hero.

547
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,281
And he's saving a lot of lives.

548
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:14,245
But the most important thing
for him to know, I feel...

549
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:17,457
is that his father's proud of him.

550
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,805
Power grid's been going haywire
in this sector.

551
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:34,974
This system's so antiquated.

552
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:06,464
What was that?

553
00:41:06,488 --> 00:41:06,488
