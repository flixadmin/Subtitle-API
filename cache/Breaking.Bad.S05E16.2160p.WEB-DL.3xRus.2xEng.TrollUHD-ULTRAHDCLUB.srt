1
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:09,838
Just get me home.

2
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:14,093
Just get me home.

3
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,720
I'll do the rest.

4
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,698
Yes, hello, this is David Linn
from <i>The New York Times.</i>

5
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:26,452
May I speak with Susan, please?
Thank you.

6
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:32,291
{\an8}Hi, Susan, it's David again.

7
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:35,586
{\an8}I was just calling to see if we can set...

8
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:39,965
{\an8}Well, yes. Well, I figured
we'd have to do the interview by phone

9
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:42,217
{\an8}since they've already left New York.

10
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:46,138
{\an8}But what we'd really love to get
is a photo of Mr. and Mrs. Schwartz

11
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,223
to go along with the article.

12
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:52,144
{\an8}When are they scheduled to get home?

13
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:58,274
{\an8}Oh, so they'll be home tonight. Gotcha.

14
00:05:58,484 --> 00:06:03,489
{\an8}Now, the address I have on them
is Upper Canyon Road. Is that still...?

15
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:06,825
{\an8}No, it isn't. They've... Let me get a pen.

16
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,870
{\an8}Where do they...?

17
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,956
{\an8}Tesuque. I see.

18
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:15,000
{\an8}And the address?

19
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:21,590
{\an8}Is that up near the opera house?
I hear that's nice.

20
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:24,927
{\an8}Well, I'll be in contact
with my photographer

21
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:27,095
{\an8}to check on his schedule.

22
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:29,097
{\an8}No, no, it's their call.

23
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:32,935
{\an8}I know how busy
Mr. and Mrs. Schwartz are.

24
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:34,478
Thank you.

25
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:37,981
This should make one hell of a story.

26
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,316
Goodbye.

27
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:59,211
<i>I'm just saying, it's apples and oranges.</i>

28
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:04,424
{\an8}Listen, I maintain, if I want pizza

29
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,385
- I go to a pizza place.
- Yeah.

30
00:07:06,593 --> 00:07:09,555
If I want Thai, I go to a Thai place.

31
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:13,767
- What is the point in comparing...
- Did I marry you?

32
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:16,186
- ...pizza to Thai?
- What has happened?

33
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:18,545
- This is different.
- They're completely...

34
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:20,983
Oh, come on, are you the man I married?

35
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:25,195
{\an8}I am the guy who wants to end
this ridiculous conversation

36
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:28,824
{\an8}kick off my shoes,
and have a very large glass of wine.

37
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:34,705
{\an8}Well, I'm gonna tell you to be my guest.

38
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:35,956
All right, wait.

39
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:40,127
The answer is 21.

40
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:41,795
- No.
- Yes.

41
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:44,339
Yes, because it has history.

42
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,008
Come on.

43
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,551
Prohibition.

44
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,138
- The <i>Sweet Smell of Success.</i>
- And Per Se has Thomas Keller.

45
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:54,725
- Game, set, and match.
- The whole vibe is so Yountville.

46
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:56,894
{\an8}You transplant it to Manhattan...

47
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:59,646
{\an8}Transplant it to Islamabad,
I would eat there.

48
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:01,273
{\an8}Oh, there's a good thought.

49
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,359
{\an8}- What, Islamabad?
- No, Napa. We have to go to Napa.

50
00:08:04,568 --> 00:08:09,197
{\an8}Oh, my God, all this talk of food.
Do you think Juana left us anything?

51
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,659
She doesn't think we're coming back
until Wednesday.

52
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:15,412
- Unless you told her.
- No, I haven't talked to her.

53
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:17,664
Oh, look, here.

54
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:20,375
- Just a pear, that'll be perfect.
- Yeah.

55
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:23,587
{\an8}You wanna get us a nice bottle of wine?

56
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,298
{\an8}Do you think we have any of those...?

57
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,885
{\an8}What are those crackers with,
like, the sun-dried tomato,

58
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:33,347
{\an8}and they were slightly peppery,
but not too peppery.

59
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:36,099
{\an8}- We don't have them?
- No.

60
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:39,394
{\an8}- Ask Juana.
- We haven't had them in forever.

61
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:43,148
{\an8}- I don't know why she doesn't get those.
- Why don't you talk to her?

62
00:08:43,357 --> 00:08:45,484
She's got that thing with her daughter.

63
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:47,736
{\an8}- Anyway, Napa?
- Yeah.

64
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:50,155
{\an8}- How long since we've been?
- Two years.

65
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,157
{\an8}Jesus, that's two years.

66
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,576
- Yeah, too long, right?
- Is this okay?

67
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:56,495
Oh, that looks <i>perfecto.</i>

68
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:59,665
You wanna get the fireplace?

69
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:02,084
Is it good?

70
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,877
Is it ripe?

71
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:06,213
Yeah.

72
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:09,883
We could invite George and Delores.
They could come up from Marin.

73
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:12,052
And Bill and Miriam Cohen.

74
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:16,014
We could have a little spa action, right?

75
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:19,142
And then we could do
some sort of wine, and then...

76
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:29,987
Hello, Gretchen.

77
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,197
Elliott.

78
00:09:33,949 --> 00:09:36,535
I really like your new house.

79
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:40,372
Walt.

80
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,251
This...

81
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:52,759
Are we looking east?

82
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:59,891
My God, you must have one great view
of the Sangre de Cristos.

83
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,603
Walt, what are you doing here?

84
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,774
I saw you on<i> Charlie Rose.</i>

85
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,318
You looked great.

86
00:10:12,154 --> 00:10:15,907
- You both did.
- If you are here to...

87
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:21,246
- To hurt us...
- Walt, whatever it is you're planning...

88
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:24,166
Actually, I'm here to give you something.

89
00:10:26,585 --> 00:10:28,545
It's out in my car.

90
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:33,258
How about the three of us take a walk
to it? It's just parked down the road.

91
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:36,053
I couldn't get it past your gate.

92
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:47,606
Elliott, if we're gonna go that way

93
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,317
you'll need a bigger knife.

94
00:11:00,784 --> 00:11:02,995
Keep stacking. It'll all fit.

95
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,338
That's all right.

96
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:15,799
Yeah, just throw it on top.

97
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:22,264
Gretchen, would you mind? We don't
want to lose any under the furniture.

98
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,144
All right.

99
00:11:28,103 --> 00:11:32,316
That is $9,720,000.

100
00:11:32,524 --> 00:11:36,111
Where did it come from?
And why is it here?

101
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,865
I earned it, and you're
going to give it to my children.

102
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,024
- What? Why?
- Walt, I don't think we...

103
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,036
On my son's 18th birthday

104
00:11:44,244 --> 00:11:47,998
which is 10 months
and two days from today

105
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,167
you will give him this money

106
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,419
in the form of an irrevocable trust.

107
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:57,465
You will tell him that it is his
to do with as he sees fit,

108
00:11:57,675 --> 00:12:02,513
but with the hope
that he uses it for his college education.

109
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:07,935
- And for the betterment of his family.
- Walt, I'm not sure that we follow.

110
00:12:08,143 --> 00:12:09,812
Why...?

111
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,314
I mean, why, in particular, would we...?

112
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:15,651
If you wanna give your kids drug money,
go do it yourself.

113
00:12:15,859 --> 00:12:17,152
I can't.

114
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,571
My wife and son hate me.

115
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:22,282
They won't take my money.

116
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:23,951
Even if they did

117
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:27,162
the federal government wouldn't let them.

118
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:33,293
But two rich benefactors who are known
for their charitable endeavors

119
00:12:33,501 --> 00:12:37,589
who would think nothing of, for
instance, writing a $28 million check

120
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:41,385
to help victims of methamphetamine abuse?

121
00:12:41,593 --> 00:12:44,805
I have to think that your money
would be very welcome.

122
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,224
It wouldn't make any sense
coming from us.

123
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,101
It certainly would.

124
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:53,814
My children are blameless victims
of their monstrous father.

125
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,567
A man who you once knew quite well.

126
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,200
Call it a beau geste,
call it liberal guilt

127
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:07,619
call it whatever you want, but do it.

128
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:15,127
And you are not to spend
a single dime of your own money.

129
00:13:15,335 --> 00:13:21,425
If there are taxes or lawyers' fees owed,
you will take it right from here.

130
00:13:21,633 --> 00:13:24,136
They use my money, never yours.

131
00:13:24,344 --> 00:13:25,971
Okay, Walt, sure.

132
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:29,058
That sounds reasonable.

133
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,394
So, what happens next?

134
00:13:33,228 --> 00:13:37,941
I guess we shake on it, and I leave.

135
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,890
I can trust you to do this.

136
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,391
Yes.

137
00:14:11,599 --> 00:14:14,602
Absolutely you can.

138
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:33,330
Don't move. Don't...
Don't dare move a muscle.

139
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:37,960
You don't want them to think that
you're trying to get away. Just breathe.

140
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:43,215
Just this afternoon,
I had an extra $200,000

141
00:14:43,423 --> 00:14:47,136
that I would have loved dearly
to leave on top of this table.

142
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:55,352
Instead, I gave it to the two best
hit men west of the Mississippi.

143
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,646
Now

144
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:01,733
whatever happens to me tomorrow

145
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,404
they'll still be out there.

146
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:09,116
Keeping tabs.

147
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:13,287
And if, for any reason

148
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:17,416
that my children do not get this money

149
00:15:17,624 --> 00:15:22,087
a kind of countdown will begin.

150
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:25,883
Maybe a day or so later,
maybe a week, a year

151
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:30,846
when you're going for a walk in Santa
Fe or Manhattan or Prague, wherever,

152
00:15:31,054 --> 00:15:36,643
and you're talking
about your stock prices

153
00:15:38,478 --> 00:15:41,732
without a worry in the world.

154
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,985
And then suddenly

155
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:48,322
you'll hear the scrape
of a footstep behind you,

156
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,574
but before you can even turn around:

157
00:15:57,664 --> 00:15:59,666
Darkness.

158
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:08,800
Cheer up, beautiful people.

159
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:13,388
This is where you get to make it right.

160
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,146
Oh, yeah, right.

161
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:14,616
You know, I don't exactly know
how to feel about all this.

162
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:15,867
For real, yo.

163
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:20,163
Whole thing felt kind of shady,
you know, like, morality-wise?

164
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,374
Totally.

165
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,044
How do you feel now?

166
00:17:27,754 --> 00:17:30,757
- Better.
- Yeah, definitely improving.

167
00:17:31,758 --> 00:17:35,470
What's this I hear about
blue meth still being out there?

168
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:39,599
- What do you mean?
- Have you heard anything?

169
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,102
Is it still being sold?

170
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,897
Yeah.

171
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:52,321
By whom?

172
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,865
It's you, right?

173
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,659
I mean, aren't you still cooking?

174
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:02,289
Damn, man.

175
00:18:02,497 --> 00:18:05,542
We were sure it was you,
because that shit is choice, yo.

176
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,960
Better than ever.

177
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:10,297
I mean, you know.

178
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,092
- Jesse.
- Seriously?

179
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:17,637
- You said he moved to Alaska.
- That's what I heard.

180
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,056
Right on, Jesse.

181
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:20,766
Passing the torch.

182
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:24,686
Damn, man, couldn't he at least
throw a brother a bone?

183
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:08,083
Whoa, what happened there?

184
00:20:10,127 --> 00:20:11,419
It's my birthday.

185
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:14,047
Yeah? Well, happy birthday.

186
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:07,475
It's easy money. Till we catch you. Say
the word, I'll take you on a ride-along.

187
00:21:07,684 --> 00:21:10,312
You can watch us knock down a meth lab.

188
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,480
Get a little excitement in your life.

189
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:15,358
Yeah, someday.

190
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,513
- Welcome. Would you like a menu?
- No, thank you.

191
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:49,267
- Chamomile tea with soy milk, please.
- All right, you got it.

192
00:22:04,908 --> 00:22:07,118
Hey, how you doing?

193
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:08,870
Good.

194
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:11,373
How's things?

195
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:13,124
Hey, I like your...

196
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:16,795
Shirt.

197
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:19,798
- My blouse?
- Nice. Yeah, I like the color.

198
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:22,801
That's a nice color on you.

199
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,469
It's kind of a...

200
00:22:24,678 --> 00:22:29,391
I don't know exactly what you'd call it.
It's kind of a cornflower blue.

201
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:33,019
Before you say or do anything,
just hear me out.

202
00:22:34,479 --> 00:22:36,314
- Todd.
- Nobody knows that I'm here.

203
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:39,775
Just listen for two minutes,
and then I'll leave.

204
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:42,529
Please. No. Please.

205
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:46,157
Just two minutes of your time.
That's all I ask.

206
00:22:48,285 --> 00:22:49,327
Please.

207
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:58,086
You're running out of methylamine,
aren't you?

208
00:22:58,295 --> 00:23:00,422
I can do the math.

209
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:04,134
You've been at it long enough.
You must be running low.

210
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:07,971
I have a new method

211
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:10,098
that requires no methylamine.

212
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:14,853
It's easy, and it will keep you in business.
And, Todd, I could teach it to you.

213
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:17,647
How did you know to find us here?

214
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:19,774
Ten a.m.

215
00:23:19,983 --> 00:23:23,111
Every Tuesday morning,
you and I met here.

216
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,991
You're rather schedule-oriented, I guess.

217
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:42,547
Sorry.

218
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:51,348
I need the money.

219
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:55,935
I've spent almost all of mine already

220
00:23:56,144 --> 00:24:00,106
just trying to stay one step ahead
of the police.

221
00:24:00,315 --> 00:24:02,984
Mr. White, I don't think there's...

222
00:24:03,193 --> 00:24:06,196
How much would it cost us?

223
00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:09,699
Nothing short of a million.

224
00:24:09,908 --> 00:24:14,204
And believe me, for this,
that is giving it away.

225
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:18,375
- I think Jack should hear this.
- Yeah, I don't know.

226
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:24,672
Now, listen, I can come up there tonight
and talk to him.

227
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,591
He'd get it.

228
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,803
This is a win-win situation.

229
00:24:30,387 --> 00:24:33,223
- Hi, what can I get for you two?
- He's just leaving.

230
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:36,142
Good seeing you again. Take care.

231
00:24:39,771 --> 00:24:41,231
For you?

232
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:42,482
I'm good.

233
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,900
And I need more stevia.

234
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:57,831
Okay, no disrespect to the man,
but doing business with him?

235
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:59,249
Right now, that's not...

236
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:02,043
Of course we're not doing business
with him.

237
00:25:03,545 --> 00:25:05,130
Todd, please.

238
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:07,507
Don't make me walk you through this.

239
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:14,597
Jesus. Did you look at him?

240
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:18,560
You'd be doing him a favor.

241
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:08,919
<i>Hello, please record after the tone.</i>

242
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:11,213
<i>Truce, all right?</i>

243
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:14,466
<i>Skyler, I have news about Walt,
and you need to hear it,</i>

244
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,802
<i>so if you're there, pick up.</i>

245
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,513
<i>Skyler...</i>

246
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:22,307
Hey.

247
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,726
What's up?

248
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:26,687
<i>Walt's in town.</i>

249
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,355
Yeah?

250
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:31,150
That car they thought he stole
in New Hampshire

251
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:34,444
they found it in a Denny's parking lot
right on Central.

252
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:38,157
<i>And your next-door neighbor,
on the right... What's her name, Becky?</i>

253
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:41,910
- Becky's on the left. Carol's on the right.
<i>- Becky, Carol, whatever.</i>

254
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:44,496
<i>She saw him at your old house.</i>

255
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:46,832
Just this morning, plain as day.

256
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:51,545
He's there, walking out of your house,
and he calls her by name.

257
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:56,133
- He didn't hurt her, did he? He didn't...?
- No, he's just like, "Hey, Becky!"

258
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:59,052
Or Carol, whatever.

259
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,638
<i>She said he looked exactly
like the Unabomber.</i>

260
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:05,601
But she's positive it was him.
They're getting calls from all over town.

261
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:08,686
He's here, he's there,
he's going to blow up city hall.

262
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:11,899
He has some sort of manifesto.
He wants to be on the news.

263
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:15,485
- Who's making these calls? Him?
<i>- There are two or three voices.</i>

264
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:19,364
<i>They're not sure if they're crank calls
or people he's put up to it,</i>

265
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:21,617
<i>or if they're actual anonymous tips.</i>

266
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:24,578
<i>It's stretching them thin,
which is maybe the point.</i>

267
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,163
<i>As far as I'm concerned</i>

268
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:30,250
there are three places that he
would go: To you, to me, or Flynn.

269
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:31,919
<i>Right.</i>

270
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:33,879
They're watching the high school.

271
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:37,299
They're probably watching your place too.

272
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:39,051
I mean

273
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,262
I know that's what Hank would do.

274
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:47,142
There is no way Walt's getting to you.
They are absolutely going to catch him.

275
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:48,435
No doubt about it.

276
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:52,481
That arrogant asshole thinks he's some
criminal mastermind, but he's not.

277
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,025
<i>But on the off chance...</i>

278
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,110
Yeah.

279
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:01,114
On the million-to-one chance

280
00:29:02,324 --> 00:29:03,992
you be on the lookout, okay?

281
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:10,082
Thanks.

282
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,836
You got it.

283
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:35,315
Five minutes.

284
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,074
Five minutes.

285
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,709
You didn't kill anybody
sneaking in here, did you?

286
00:29:55,419 --> 00:29:58,130
- You didn't hurt anybody?
- No.

287
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:00,257
Didn't have to.

288
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:14,021
You look terrible.

289
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:17,107
Yeah.

290
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,068
But I feel good.

291
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,947
So talk.

292
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:27,909
Why are you here?

293
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:40,380
It's over.

294
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:45,135
And I needed a proper goodbye.

295
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:48,347
Not our last phone call.

296
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:52,726
So you're going to the police?

297
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,646
They'll be coming to me.

298
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,274
If you're in custody...

299
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,196
what stops those people from coming back?

300
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,906
When...

301
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:09,534
When I still had the house

302
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:12,204
three men came in the middle of the night

303
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:15,165
wearing masks,
threatening Holly and Flynn and me.

304
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:18,502
They told me not to talk about
that woman at the car wash,

305
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,462
and if you're in custody...

306
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,632
They're not coming back.
Not after tonight.

307
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:26,468
What's tonight?

308
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:35,519
We don't want your money, Walt.

309
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:39,106
I thought Flynn made that clear.

310
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,982
He did.

311
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:44,152
And I don't have any to give you.

312
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:47,447
I spent the last of it getting here.

313
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:51,952
All I have to give you

314
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:54,496
is this.

315
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,884
Call the DEA once I leave.

316
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:12,222
Tell them I was here.
That I forced my way in.

317
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,057
Tell them...

318
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:21,064
Tell them I wanted
bacon and eggs on my birthday,

319
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:24,443
and that I gave you that ticket.

320
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:27,988
Those numbers are GPS coordinates.

321
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,658
For what?

322
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:36,538
A burial site.

323
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:40,667
That's where they'll
find Hank and Steve Gomez.

324
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:46,798
It's where I buried our money.

325
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,302
And the men who stole it from us

326
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,721
the men who still have it

327
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:55,682
they murdered Hank and Steve,

328
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:58,977
and put them in that hole.

329
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,522
Now, you trade that,

330
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:05,108
for a deal with the prosecutor.

331
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:07,944
You get yourself out of this.

332
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:10,071
Skyler.

333
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:14,534
Skyler.

334
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:20,207
All the things that I did

335
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:25,045
- you need to understand...
- If I have to hear

336
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,380
one more time

337
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:30,509
that you did this for the family...

338
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,844
I did it for me.

339
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:41,436
I liked it.

340
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,942
I was good at it.

341
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:50,278
And

342
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:52,781
I was

343
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:55,617
really...

344
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:02,666
I was alive.

345
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:44,624
Flynn will be home soon.

346
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,086
Before I go...

347
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:52,757
may I see her?

348
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,840
Damn, man, this thing's a classic.

349
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:43,344
What block you got in it?
The 500 or the 425?

350
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,140
Couldn't tell you.

351
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,646
Well...

352
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,899
Five hundred.

353
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,985
That's the one you want.

354
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:02,447
No replacement for displacement.

355
00:38:12,624 --> 00:38:14,042
Where to?

356
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,293
To the clubhouse.

357
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:35,647
Go ahead, just park it right in front
over here.

358
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,861
No, no, no, just straight in, man.
Just... What are...?

359
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,739
All right, fine, here, whatever.

360
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:58,711
Hey, how you doing?

361
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:02,131
Turn around, put your arms out like this.

362
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,738
While you're at it,
why don't you lift your shirt up

363
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,240
give us a spin?

364
00:39:28,575 --> 00:39:30,702
Christ, I'm not wearing a wire.

365
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:47,218
Okay?

366
00:39:48,970 --> 00:39:52,849
- My wallet and keys?
- Yeah, you'll get them back. Just relax.

367
00:40:04,903 --> 00:40:06,321
Stay here.

368
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,656
Keep your eyes open.

369
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:13,786
Jesus, look at you with that head of hair.
Is that real?

370
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:15,371
Yes.

371
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,791
- That's not a wig? Seriously?
- No.

372
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,502
What were you doing before, shaving it?

373
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:23,504
Yes.

374
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:26,466
Christ, that is one fine head of hair.

375
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,968
I mean, otherwise,
you look like shit, but...

376
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:33,598
Hello to you too, Jack.
Now, can we talk business?

377
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,892
I don't think so, no.

378
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:40,063
- Did Todd tell you what I'm offering?
- Yeah, he told me.

379
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:44,192
The thing is
we're not really in the market.

380
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:48,655
You're low on methylamine.
What happens then?

381
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,573
No, we'll get more.

382
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:55,036
That Quayle woman's got her own setup.
The heat's off her.

383
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:58,498
She can break loose a barrel.
It ain't broke, so why fix it?

384
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,459
Todd, please, would you explain things
to your uncle?

385
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:04,170
Explain to him the benefit
of what I'm offering.

386
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:08,883
You really shouldn't
have come back, Mr. White.

387
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,845
I'm sorry.

388
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,767
- Wait. Jack.
- Where do you want it?

389
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:20,269
I don't know,
anywhere but my living room?

390
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,106
- Take him out back.
- Jack, look, you owe me.

391
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,764
- You owe me.
- Hey, hey, hey.

392
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:26,567
- Let's go.
- I owe you, what for?

393
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:29,988
Jesse Pinkman. You promised
you would kill him, and you didn't.

394
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:32,532
- Instead, you partnered with him.
- All right.

395
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,784
- You're his partner now...
- Whoa, stop.

396
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,752
Partners? What are you talking about?

397
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:46,379
He's alive, isn't he?

398
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,548
He's cooking for you.

399
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,425
What, are you gonna lie?

400
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:54,345
Him being alive
is not him and me being partners.

401
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:56,264
Not by a damn sight.

402
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:59,183
What, you think I'd partner with a rat?

403
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:02,561
- Where is that little piece of shit?
- He's finishing up a batch.

404
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:04,272
Go get him. Bring him here.

405
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,790
- Uncle Jack...
- No. No, no, no.

406
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,986
This one here, calling me a liar?

407
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:13,072
He just insulted you,
he insulted me, all of us.

408
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:17,243
Jesus. Hustle it up. Come on.
Let's get this over with.

409
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,789
I'm gonna show you
just how wrong you are.

410
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:25,376
Then I'm putting that bullet
in your head myself.

411
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:24,018
Yeah, you see what I'm talking about,
you son of a bitch?

412
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:30,858
Now, does this look
like a partner to you?

413
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,860
Come here. Take a look.

414
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,071
Come here!

415
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:48,334
Take a look at him.

416
00:43:48,543 --> 00:43:50,628
Have a gander.

417
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,880
This is my partner.

418
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:55,842
Right, partner? Right, buddy?

419
00:43:57,426 --> 00:44:00,513
Hardworking, good partner.
Fifty-fifty partner.

420
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:06,853
Can you hurry this shit up?
Make it quick?

421
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:19,782
- Toddy, get him off, would you?
- Yeah, Toddy, get them both off.

422
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:37,276
Uncle Jack.

423
00:45:55,503 --> 00:45:57,463
Jesus.

424
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:00,466
Mr. White.

425
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,456
Wait. Wait.

426
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,716
You want your money, right?

427
00:47:25,718 --> 00:47:28,012
You wanna know where it is?

428
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:31,682
You pull that trigger, you'll never...

429
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,192
Do it.

430
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,910
You want this.

431
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:37,331
Say the words.

432
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:41,669
Say you want this!

433
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:46,507
Nothing happens until I hear you say it.

434
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:50,927
I want this.

435
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,661
Then do it yourself.

436
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:48,944
Pick up the phone.

437
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,741
<i>Hello?</i>

438
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:56,160
Is it done?

439
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:57,870
Is he gone?

440
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:00,122
<i>Yeah, it's done.</i>

441
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:02,500
<i>He's gone.</i>

442
00:50:03,042 --> 00:50:04,251
<i>They're all gone.</i>

443
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:07,630
Todd? Who is this?

444
00:50:08,464 --> 00:50:10,174
It's Walt.

445
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:12,927
How are you feeling?

446
00:50:13,636 --> 00:50:15,846
Kind of under the weather?

447
00:50:16,055 --> 00:50:18,724
Like you've got the flu?

448
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:21,060
That would be the ricin I gave you.

449
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:26,774
<i>I slipped it into that stevia crap
that you're always putting in your tea.</i>

450
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,817
Oh, my God.

451
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,781
Well...

452
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:38,077
goodbye, Lydia.
