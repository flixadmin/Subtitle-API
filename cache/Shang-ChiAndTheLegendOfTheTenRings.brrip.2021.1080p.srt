00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:47,215
<b>The Legend of the Ten Rings</b>

2
00:00:47,424 --> 00:00:50,093
<b>has been told for thousands of years.</b>

3
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:56,433
<b>Every generation,
the story grows.</b>

4
00:00:56,599 --> 00:01:01,396
<b>But at it's centre
there is always one man.</b>

5
00:01:10,113 --> 00:01:16,953
<b>Some say he found the rings in a crater
or stole them from a tomb.</b>

6
00:01:19,706 --> 00:01:22,542
<b>They gave him the strength of a god,</b>

7
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:26,212
<b>and the gift of eternal life.</b>

8
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:36,389
<b>He could have used them for good.</b>

9
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,979
<b>But all he wanted...</b>

10
00:01:43,146 --> 00:01:44,856
<b>was power.</b>

11
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,485
<b>He called his army The Ten Rings.</b>

12
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:37,826
<b>Over the centuries, they spread
into every corner of the world.</b>

13
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:47,961
<b>They moved in the shadows...</b>

14
00:02:50,338 --> 00:02:52,382
<b>Toppled governments...</b>

15
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:56,970
<b>And changed the course of history.</b>

16
00:03:13,194 --> 00:03:17,490
<b>He chased money and power
for a thousand years.</b>

17
00:03:18,324 --> 00:03:21,452
<b>But he still wanted more.</b>

18
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:28,543
<b>Have you heard the legend of Ta Lo?</b>

19
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:34,841
<b>A hidden village with mythical creatures
and ancient magic.</b>

20
00:03:35,008 --> 00:03:39,971
<b>Where people practise
a martial arts style from the gods.</b>

21
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:42,015
<b>I want to find it.</b>

22
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:45,643
<b>Of course. I'll send a scout
to explore the area,</b>

23
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,438
<b>and come back
with more information.</b>

24
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,567
<b>I want to go now.</b>

25
00:04:16,174 --> 00:04:17,342
<b>The forest...</b>

26
00:04:19,302 --> 00:04:21,930
<b>...is moving.</b>

27
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:55,838
<b>He had nothing left
on Earth to conquer.</b>

28
00:04:59,968 --> 00:05:04,472
<b>That's when he came
for my home.</b>

29
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:15,817
<b>Where's the entrance
to Ta Lo?</b>

30
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:19,862
<b>You're not welcome
in our village.</b>

31
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:23,574
<b>You don't know who
you're talking to.</b>

32
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:25,827
<b>I don't care who you are.</b>

33
00:05:26,536 --> 00:05:30,373
<b>Turn around now,
and I won't have to hurt you.</b>

34
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,341
<b>Is that all?</b>

35
00:07:59,814 --> 00:08:02,316
<b>That was the first time
I met your father.</b>

36
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:09,824
<b>He was the last person
I thought I'd fall for.</b>

37
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:14,579
<b>But love had other plans.</b>

38
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:20,543
<b>Shang-Chi,</b>

39
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:23,504
<b>there's much more to know
about the legend of the rings,</b>

40
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:27,466
<b>but you'll learn about that
when you're older.</b>

41
00:08:28,134 --> 00:08:33,347
<b>If Dad's rings were so powerful,
how did you beat him?</b>

42
00:08:35,057 --> 00:08:41,856
<b>Where I'm from, we are empowered
by the magic of the Great Protector.</b>

43
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:49,197
<b>When you have the heart
of our dragon,</b>

44
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:52,408
<b>you can do some amazing things.</b>

45
00:08:52,992 --> 00:08:55,870
<b>Can you still do those things?</b>

46
00:08:57,747 --> 00:09:01,959
<b>I left those powers in Ta Lo
with our dragon,</b>

47
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:05,588
<b>but what I got in return
is so much better.</b>

48
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:11,844
<b>I want you to have this.</b>

49
00:09:13,638 --> 00:09:15,848
<b>Whenever you feel lost,</b>

50
00:09:16,015 --> 00:09:19,018
<b>this will help you
find your way home.</b>

51
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,270
<b>Can you remember that?</b>

52
00:09:41,249 --> 00:09:42,458
<b>Okay.</b>

53
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:45,604
<b>Hello, sir,</b>

54
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,065
<b>welcome to the Fairmont...</b>

55
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:49,567
<b>I'm driving.</b>

56
00:10:49,734 --> 00:10:51,193
<b>No, you're not... Katy.</b>

57
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,237
<b>Hey, hey, get back here.</b>

58
00:10:53,321 --> 00:10:54,363
<b>Give me the key.</b>

59
00:10:55,865 --> 00:10:58,200
<b>Please open the door.</b>

60
00:10:58,284 --> 00:11:00,828
<b>Oh, my God.</b>

61
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,955
<b>- Get out.
- You get in!</b>

62
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,081
<b>Look, if happens
to this thing,</b>

63
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:05,166
<b>we're gonna be jobless</b>

64
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,500
<b>and in debt
for the rest of our lives.</b>

65
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,753
<b>Oh, come on. Nothing's gonna
happen to this car.</b>

66
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,338
<b>I'm the Asian Jeff Gordon.</b>

67
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:11,672
<b>I don't know who that is.</b>

68
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,632
<b>Most career wins
in all of NASCAR history?</b>

69
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:15,301
<b>Please get out of the car.</b>

70
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,761
<b>Shaun,</b>

71
00:11:16,886 --> 00:11:18,971
<b>we've been friends
for 10 years, okay?</b>

72
00:11:19,138 --> 00:11:21,182
<b>You know I'm not an idiot.</b>

73
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,393
<b>Please, get in. I'll go slow.</b>

74
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:28,689
<b>Katy, watch the...</b>

75
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:36,405
<b><i>I knew Katy was trouble</i></b>

76
00:11:36,489 --> 00:11:37,823
<b><i>the first day we met
in high school.</i></b>

77
00:11:38,032 --> 00:11:39,075
<b>I was getting picked on a lot,</b>

78
00:11:39,158 --> 00:11:41,077
<b>for all the reasons
we all get picked on a lot.</b>

79
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:42,953
<b>Plus, I had just moved
to the US,</b>

80
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:44,497
<b>so I was struggling
with my English,</b>

81
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:45,748
<b>and I was on my way
to lunch one day</b>

82
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:47,666
<b>when this guy
who was like twice my size</b>

83
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,751
<b>yells at me
from down the hall,</b>

84
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:50,127
<b>"What's up, Gangnam Style?"</b>

85
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:52,755
<b>So I yelled back,
"I'm not Korean, idiot."</b>

86
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:53,839
<b>And I turn the corner,</b>

87
00:11:53,923 --> 00:11:55,549
<b>and I see this guy
drop his backpack,</b>

88
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:56,967
<b>he's getting
all up in his face...</b>

89
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:58,928
<b>And right before he was about
to throw the first punch,</b>

90
00:11:59,095 --> 00:12:00,930
<b>Katy comes out of nowhere,</b>

91
00:12:01,097 --> 00:12:04,350
<b>steps right between us
and starts screaming the lyrics</b>

92
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:05,851
<b>to <i>Hotel California.</i></b>

93
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:07,019
<b>What?</b>

94
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:09,230
<b>It's the art of confusion.
Works great on stupid people.</b>

95
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:10,481
<b>And that's how we met.</b>

96
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:12,066
<b>Then I pulled him
into the parking lot...</b>

97
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:13,359
<b>At which point she revealed</b>

98
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,736
<b>that she had also swiped
the keys to the guy's Mustang.</b>

99
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:17,988
<b>Yeah, we went on a little
joyride around the block.</b>

100
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:19,532
<b>And your wife
was in the car, too.</b>

101
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,325
<b>- That's true. You were.
- What?</b>

102
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:22,827
<b>I was just in the back seat.</b>

103
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,911
<b>That's a part of the car.</b>

104
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:25,079
<b>That's still
a part of the car.</b>

105
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:26,789
<b>How have you
never told me this story?</b>

106
00:12:26,956 --> 00:12:28,124
<b>You know,
before she was a lawyer,</b>

107
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:29,458
<b>your girl was pretty wild.</b>

108
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,293
<b>Oh! What happened?</b>

109
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:34,296
<b>I grew up.</b>

110
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,090
<b>What's that supposed to mean?</b>

111
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:37,174
<b>Yeah, what's that
supposed to mean?</b>

112
00:12:37,258 --> 00:12:38,926
<b>That maybe there's a point</b>

113
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,970
<b>where you're supposed
to stop going on joyrides</b>

114
00:12:41,137 --> 00:12:43,556
<b>and start thinking about
living up to your potential.</b>

115
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:45,224
<b>Please tell me
you're kidding, Soo.</b>

116
00:12:45,391 --> 00:12:46,392
<b>Look,</b>

117
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,643
<b>we're now living in a world</b>

118

<b>where at any moment</b>

119
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:50,563
<b>half the population
can just disappear.</b>

120
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:53,566
<b>Life's too short
and too fragile.</b>

121
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:55,317
<b>Katy, you're a valet driver</b>

122

<b>with an honours degree
from Berkeley,</b>

123

<b>and Shaun can speak,

124

<b>You've always been the most
talented people I know.</b>

125
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:03,617
<b>I just don't get why
you're scared</b>

126

<b>to actually use it
for something serious.</b>

127
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:07,288
<b>Wow.</b>

128
00:13:08,164 --> 00:13:10,875
<b>You sound like my mom.

<b>dress like her
a little bit, too.</b>

130

<b>Where's this from, Talbots?</b>

131

<b>We're not running

132

<b>How is it running to have jobs
that you actually like?</b>

133
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:20,634
<b>Yeah, that doesn't
even make any sense.</b>

134
00:13:20,718 --> 00:13:23,095
<b>Did you think
valet parking is easy?</b>

135
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:25,181
<b>It's like the most
challenging job ever.</b>

136
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:27,516
<b>You need people skills,
driving skills...</b>

137
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:29,226
<b>Soo can't even
parallel park.</b>

138

<b>Well, it's almost midnight.

<b>Should probably be

140
00:13:38,903 --> 00:13:40,613
<b>Yeah, we can be responsible.
We can do that.</b>

<b>Mom, I can't work on an empty
stomach, my legs get crampy.</b>

155
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,886
<b>Maybe Shaun can help him</b>

156
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:48,180
<b>instead of just showing up
every day to eat our food.</b>

157
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:49,557
<b>I'm happy to help.</b>

158
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:52,434
<b>No, it's Ruihua's job,
let him do it.</b>

159
00:14:53,102 --> 00:14:54,144
<b>Waipo.</b>

160
00:14:55,312 --> 00:14:56,939
<b>That seat's for Waigong.</b>

161
00:14:57,565 --> 00:14:59,108
<b>Oh, sorry.</b>

162
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:04,613
<b>He's getting all his favourite things
this year for the Day of the Dead.</b>

163
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,365
<b>Are you sure
that Waigong's allowed to take</b>

164
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:07,449
<b>Funyuns and cigarettes</b>

165
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:08,742
<b>back to the afterlife?</b>

166
00:15:08,826 --> 00:15:10,578
<b>He can take anything.</b>

167
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:14,748
<b>Last year I put a bottle of whisky
on his grave...</b>

168
00:15:15,124 --> 00:15:16,834
<b>And it was gone the next morning.</b>

169
00:15:18,168 --> 00:15:21,422
<b>I know you kids think it's silly.</b>

170
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:23,299
<b>We don't think
it's silly, Waipo.</b>

171
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,968
<b>We just know Waigong would've
wanted you to move on</b>

172
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:27,136
<b>and enjoy your life.</b>

173
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:29,430
<b>"Moving on"

174
00:15:29,597 --> 00:15:31,765
<b>You're American, Mom!
Don't forget.</b>

175
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:33,350
<b>Shaun,</b>

176
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:36,687
<b>did my daughter apply
to any new jobs this week?</b>

177
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:38,606
<b>She really likes her job.</b>

178
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:39,857
<b>We both do.</b>

179
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,941
<b>Mm-hmm.</b>

180
00:15:41,025 --> 00:15:42,818
<b>Waigong didn't move here
from Hunan</b>

181
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:44,528
<b>so you could park cars
for a living.</b>

182
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:47,573
<b>Well, on that note,</b>

183
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:49,116
<b>I think we're gonna
miss our bus.</b>

184
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,242
<b>Mm.</b>

185
00:15:50,326 --> 00:15:52,077
<b>I'm sorry
for my unacceptable job.</b>

186
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:53,537
<b>And for staying out late
last night,</b>

187
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:55,164
<b>trying to enjoy my life.</b>

188
00:15:55,623 --> 00:15:57,499
<b>But one day, I'll make you

<b>I'm proud of you, sis.</b>

190
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:01,670
<b>Parking cars is super hard.</b>

191
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:02,880
<b>Thanks, bro.</b>

192
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:04,214
<b>Maybe one day you'll pass

<b>Come on, Shaun, let's go.</b>

195
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:11,889
<b>When are you two going
to get married?</b>

196
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:13,265
<b>Waipo, we're just friends.</b>

197
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:16,977
<b>All right. Go, go, go.</b>

198
00:16:24,777 --> 00:16:26,945
<b>Look. Look at that.
Look at that girl.</b>

199
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:29,031
<b>She's writing a research paper

200

<b>So?</b>

201
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:32,034
<b>That is exactly the daughter</b>

202

<b>my mom wishes

<b>I'm sorry about her.</b>

204
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,167
<b>How's it goin'?</b>

205
00:16:44,213 --> 00:16:46,507
<b>Give me the pendant,</b>

206
00:16:46,674 --> 00:16:48,801
<b>and no one gets hurt.</b>

207
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,969
<b>Do you know this guy?</b>

208
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:54,098
<b>I don't know what

<b>I don't want any trouble.</b>

212

<b>Then give us the pendant!</b>

213
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:05,984
<b>You have the wrong guy!</b>

214
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:07,403
<b>Does he look like

215
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:09,113
<b>Come on, bro!</b>

216
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:19,373
<b>You okay?</b>

217
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:36,932
<b>Yo, what up, y'all?

<b>I'm not gonna handle this.</b>

232

<b>Every time I've tried to drive

234
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,683
<b>Open the door, please!</b>

00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:15,961
<b>Sorry. Heh.</b>

246
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:18,088
<b>We make a good team.</b>

247

<b>Shaun. Hey.</b>

248
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:52,622

250
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,209
<b>- Macau.
- Macau?</b>

251
00:22:56,293 --> 00:22:57,586
<b>Those guys are going

<b>and I have to

253
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:00,881
<b>You have a sister?</b>

254
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:02,049
<b>Look, I know
this is confusing.</b>

255

<b>I'll explain it

258
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:06,970
<b>This is bullshit!</b>

<b>I have been by your side

<b>I get there are things you

261
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:13,185
<b>and I never wanted to push.</b>

262
00:23:13,685 --> 00:23:16,354
<b>But a guy with a freaking
machete for an arm</b>

263

<b>just chopped

<b>Who the hell are you?</b>

265
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:30,994
<b>My sister sent me this

266

<b>I think it's the address
of where she's staying.</b>

267
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:39,086
<b>Those guys back there
were sent by my dad.</b>

268
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:40,253
<b>What?</b>

269
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:42,631
<b>If they hurt her...</b>

270
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:49,429
<b>I'm sorry, but I have to go.</b>

271

<b>Fine.</b>

272
00:23:55,227 --> 00:23:56,645
<b>You can explain on the plane.</b>

273
00:23:56,812 --> 00:23:58,146
<b>What?
No, Katy, you can't just...</b>

274
00:23:58,313 --> 00:24:00,023
<b>You can explain
on the plane, Shaun!</b>

<b><i>After my mom died...</i></b>

<b><i>Beef or vegetarian?</i></b>

<b>Um...</b>

291
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:08,151
<b>- Vegetarian would be great.
- Yeah, same.</b>

292
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:09,319
<b>- Okay.
- Thank you.</b>

293
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:11,529
<b>So...</b>

294
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:14,074
<b>Oh, we're out
of the vegetarian too.</b>

295
00:26:14,658 --> 00:26:15,867
<b>Now we only have beef.</b>

296
00:26:16,952 --> 00:26:18,954
<b>Beef. 'Cause that's all

- Yes.</b>

00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:21,414
<b>- And...
- Beef.</b>

299
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:23,458
<b>- And the beef.
- Two beefs.</b>

300
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:30,924
<b>Did you go through with it?</b>

301

<b>I'm sorry about your mom.</b>

305

00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:36,612
<b>a week turned to a month,</b>

462
00:36:36,696 --> 00:36:38,948
<b>and a month
turned to 6 years.</b>

463
00:36:44,412 --> 00:36:45,872
<b>That's how long
it took me to realise</b>

464
00:36:45,955 --> 00:36:47,665
<b>I didn't need him any more.</b>

465
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:52,712
<b>I built this place on my own.</b>

466
00:36:53,004 --> 00:36:56,841
<b>I didn't need you then,
and I don't need you now.</b>

467
00:36:58,634 --> 00:37:00,553
<b>Then why would you
send me the postcard?</b>

468
00:37:01,012 --> 00:37:02,388
<b>What postcard?</b>

469
00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:12,064
<b>I didn't send you this.</b>

470
00:37:19,363 --> 00:37:20,781
<b>Is there a back exit?</b>

471
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,366
<b>Shaun.</b>

472
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,995
<b>Hey. Hey!
Hey, open up!</b>

473
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:31,876
<b>She's gone, dude.</b>

474
00:37:48,643 --> 00:37:49,644
<b>What do we do?</b>

475
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,228
<b>What do we do?</b>

476
00:37:51,562 --> 00:37:52,563
<b>Uh...</b>

477
00:37:58,736 --> 00:38:00,112
<b>Come on!</b>

478
00:38:05,076 --> 00:38:07,203
<b>Oh, hell no. Screw you!
I'm not doing this.</b>

479
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:08,371
<b>If we make it to the elevator,</b>

480
00:38:08,454 --> 00:38:09,664
<b>we can hop in
on the next floor.</b>

481
00:38:11,165 --> 00:38:13,000
<b>Katy, we're out of options.
We have to go now.</b>

482
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,214
<b>1, 2, 3.</b>

483
00:38:20,466 --> 00:38:21,467
<b>Whoa.</b>

484
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,262
<b>Just head
straight for that elevator.</b>

485
00:38:26,389 --> 00:38:27,556
<b>You got this.</b>

486
00:38:39,443 --> 00:38:41,028
<b>I'll buy you some time.
Just keep going.</b>

487
00:39:31,245 --> 00:39:33,456
<b><i>On a dark desert highway</i></b>

488
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:36,125
<b><i>Cool wind in my hair</i></b>

489
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:46,260
<b>Shaun!</b>

490
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:51,515
<b>Shaun! Shaun!</b>

491
00:39:54,977 --> 00:39:56,729
<b>Oh, my God! Ohhh!</b>

492
00:40:01,734 --> 00:40:02,777
<b>I'm coming!</b>

493
00:40:08,032 --> 00:40:09,283
<b>Shaun!</b>

494
00:40:10,451 --> 00:40:11,619
<b>Hang on.</b>

495
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:16,123
<b>Gotcha.</b>

496
00:40:16,624 --> 00:40:17,625
<b>Shaun!</b>

497
00:40:19,376 --> 00:40:20,669
<b>Katy!</b>

498
00:40:45,069 --> 00:40:46,570
<b>You left us for dead!</b>

499
00:40:48,656 --> 00:40:50,616
<b>Now you know how it feels.</b>

500
00:41:09,885 --> 00:41:11,011
<b>What does
he want with the pendant...</b>

501
00:41:17,101 --> 00:41:18,727
<b>Did America make you soft?</b>

502
00:41:33,701 --> 00:41:35,119
<b>He has the pendant!</b>

503
00:42:59,203 --> 00:43:00,204
<b>I told my men</b>

504
00:43:00,287 --> 00:43:03,624
<b>they wouldn't be able
to kill you if they tried.</b>

505
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:06,335
<b>Glad I was right.</b>

506
00:43:12,007 --> 00:43:14,677
<b>I've missed you, my son.</b>

507
00:43:18,889 --> 00:43:20,349
<b>Let's go home.</b>

508
00:44:19,158 --> 00:44:20,534
<b>My son is home.</b>

509
00:44:25,122 --> 00:44:26,582
<b>Take the girls to their room.</b>

510
00:44:37,259 --> 00:44:39,887
<b>I've seen some really
scary stuff this week,</b>

511
00:44:40,054 --> 00:44:43,057
<b>but your dad's on,
like, a whole 'nother level.</b>

512
00:44:44,767 --> 00:44:46,477
<b>Is he gonna kill us?</b>

513
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:51,398
<b>Just nod. Don't talk.
He'll forget you're there.</b>

514
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,817
<b>That's how I survived.</b>

515
00:44:54,902 --> 00:44:56,820
<b>He always treat you like that?</b>

516
00:44:58,739 --> 00:45:00,908
<b>Only after my mom died.</b>

517
00:45:02,868 --> 00:45:07,289
<b>He said he couldn't look at me
because I reminded him of her.</b>

518
00:45:08,874 --> 00:45:11,085
<b>I wasn't allowed to train
with the boys.</b>

519
00:45:12,378 --> 00:45:14,129
<b>But I watched
everything they did</b>

520
00:45:14,213 --> 00:45:16,256
<b>and taught myself
to do it better.</b>

521
00:45:18,592 --> 00:45:19,968
<b>When did you leave?</b>

522
00:45:20,135 --> 00:45:22,388
<b>I ran away when I was 16.</b>

523
00:45:22,805 --> 00:45:25,432
<b>As soon as I knew
my brother wasn't coming back.</b>

524
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:29,353
<b>You started an underground
fight ring in Macau</b>

525
00:45:29,978 --> 00:45:31,730
<b>when you were 16 years old?</b>

526
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:36,151
<b>If my dad won't let me
into his empire,</b>

527
00:45:36,235 --> 00:45:37,694
<b>I'm gonna build my own.</b>

528
00:45:38,987 --> 00:45:40,322
<b>Hell yeah.</b>

529
00:46:06,682 --> 00:46:07,683
<b>Shang-Chi.</b>

530
00:46:10,227 --> 00:46:12,104
<b>That's enough.</b>

531
00:46:18,402 --> 00:46:20,863
<b>Have you been
practicing your English?</b>

532
00:46:23,031 --> 00:46:24,158
<b>Yes.</b>

533
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,830
<b>You have to strengthen your
mind along with your body.</b>

534
00:46:36,211 --> 00:46:39,756
<b>If you want them
to be yours one day,</b>

535
00:46:39,923 --> 00:46:43,844
<b>you have to show me you're
strong enough to carry them.</b>

536
00:47:01,445 --> 00:47:02,946
<b>How did you find me?</b>

537
00:47:03,739 --> 00:47:05,991
<b>I always know
where my children are.</b>

538
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:08,785
<b>I gave you 10 years
to live your life,</b>

539
00:47:08,869 --> 00:47:10,162
<b>and where did it get you?</b>

540
00:47:13,415 --> 00:47:17,252
<b>Now it's time for you
to take your place by my side.</b>

541
00:47:18,253 --> 00:47:20,589
<b>That's not gonna happen.</b>

542
00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:25,719
<b>American girl.</b>

543
00:47:25,886 --> 00:47:27,012
<b>Her name is Katy.</b>

544
00:47:28,305 --> 00:47:29,973
<b>What is your Chinese name?</b>

545
00:47:33,977 --> 00:47:35,270
<b>Ruiwen.</b>

546
00:47:36,313 --> 00:47:38,482
<b>Names are sacred, Ruiwen.</b>

547
00:47:38,649 --> 00:47:40,651
<b>They connect us
not only to ourselves,</b>

548
00:47:40,734 --> 00:47:42,528
<b>but to everyone
who came before.</b>

549
00:47:43,987 --> 00:47:45,656
<b>A funny story.</b>

550
00:47:45,822 --> 00:47:48,283
<b>Some years ago,
a terrorist from America</b>

551
00:47:48,367 --> 00:47:49,785
<b>needed a boogeyman</b>

552
00:47:49,952 --> 00:47:52,579
<b>to bring your country
to its knees.</b>

553
00:47:52,746 --> 00:47:55,415
<b>So, he appropriated
The Ten Rings.</b>

554
00:47:55,499 --> 00:47:56,500
<b>My Ten Rings.</b>

555
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:59,086
<b>But because
he didn't know my actual name,</b>

556
00:47:59,169 --> 00:48:00,546
<b>he invented a new one.</b>

557
00:48:01,171 --> 00:48:03,131
<b>Do you know the name he chose?</b>

558
00:48:04,967 --> 00:48:06,510
<b>The Mandarin.</b>

559
00:48:06,677 --> 00:48:09,638
<b>He gave his figurehead
the name of a chicken dish.</b>

560
00:48:10,055 --> 00:48:11,473
<b>And it worked.</b>

561
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,433
<b>America was terrified.</b>

562
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:15,894
<b>Of an orange.</b>

563
00:48:17,688 --> 00:48:18,981
<b>The truth is,</b>

564
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:22,025
<b>I've had many names
throughout my life.</b>

565
00:48:22,734 --> 00:48:25,153
<b>The Warrior King, Master Khan,</b>

566
00:48:25,237 --> 00:48:27,364
<b>the most dangerous man
on Earth.</b>

567
00:48:27,698 --> 00:48:31,743
<b>For years, I thought that was
all I was meant to be.</b>

568
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:37,457
<b>But when I met their mother,</b>

569
00:48:38,208 --> 00:48:40,002
<b>everything changed.</b>

570
00:48:54,224 --> 00:48:57,853
<b><i>She showed me a part of myself
I didn't know was there.</i></b>

571
00:49:00,606 --> 00:49:03,483
<b><i>It was like I was seeing
the world for the first time.</i></b>

572
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:17,205
<b><i>She gave up everything
so we could be together.</i></b>

573
00:49:20,459 --> 00:49:22,127
<b><i>And so did I.</i></b>

574
00:49:37,184 --> 00:49:38,852
<b>You know who's in there?</b>

575
00:49:39,019 --> 00:49:40,854
<b>Say, "Hello, little sister!"</b>

576
00:49:47,319 --> 00:49:48,779
<b><i>After all those years,</i></b>

577
00:49:48,862 --> 00:49:50,447
<b><i>I finally found something</i></b>

578
00:49:50,614 --> 00:49:52,783
<b><i>worth growing old for.</i></b>

579
00:49:58,246 --> 00:50:00,624
<b>My real name is Wenwu.</b>

580
00:50:01,458 --> 00:50:04,044
<b>She was the only one
who called me that.</b>

581
00:50:05,712 --> 00:50:07,506
<b>And when she died...</b>

582
00:50:10,717 --> 00:50:13,053
<b>I was lost for many years.</b>

583
00:50:15,764 --> 00:50:17,766
<b>But I'm not lost any more.</b>

584
00:50:22,145 --> 00:50:23,605
<b>When you children ran away,</b>

585
00:50:23,772 --> 00:50:26,316
<b>I was so desperate
to connect with your mother,</b>

586
00:50:26,483 --> 00:50:29,695
<b>I threw myself back into
the studies of her village.</b>

587
00:50:30,278 --> 00:50:32,072
<b>The legendary Ta Lo.</b>

588
00:50:33,281 --> 00:50:34,449
<b>I wasn't able</b>

589
00:50:34,533 --> 00:50:36,785
<b>to find the secret path
to the village entrance,</b>

590
00:50:36,952 --> 00:50:40,497
<b>but I did find
what they are hiding.</b>

591
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:43,583
<b>There's a gate
deep in their mountains.</b>

592
00:50:44,251 --> 00:50:46,920
<b>Your mother
is waiting for us there.</b>

593
00:50:49,881 --> 00:50:51,508
<b>I know this is a lot.</b>

594
00:50:51,717 --> 00:50:55,554
<b>I might not have believed it
if she didn't tell me herself.</b>

595
00:50:56,388 --> 00:50:58,014
<b>What are you talking about?</b>

596
00:50:58,515 --> 00:51:00,600
<b>I was sitting right here
in this seat,</b>

597
00:51:01,017 --> 00:51:03,061
<b>deep in my research...</b>

598
00:51:04,271 --> 00:51:06,148
<b>and she spoke to me.</b>

599
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:09,693
<b>It was like
she was standing in this room.</b>

600
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:12,696
<b>I could feel her breath
on my cheek</b>

601
00:51:12,779 --> 00:51:14,740
<b>and her hand on my back.</b>

602
00:51:16,283 --> 00:51:18,535
<b>She told me she needs my help.</b>

603
00:51:20,287 --> 00:51:21,496
<b>To do what?</b>

604
00:51:22,289 --> 00:51:24,666
<b>To save her from her people.</b>

605
00:51:27,836 --> 00:51:29,671
<b>After we fell in love,</b>

606
00:51:29,755 --> 00:51:32,466
<b>your mother wanted us
to live in Ta Lo.</b>

607
00:51:32,632 --> 00:51:34,634
<b>She asked permission
from the elders,</b>

608
00:51:34,718 --> 00:51:35,886
<b>and they refused.</b>

609
00:51:36,052 --> 00:51:38,263
<b>They said I wasn't worthy.</b>

610
00:51:40,056 --> 00:51:41,391
<b>She would still be with us.</b>

611
00:51:41,475 --> 00:51:44,102
<b>We would all be
living there together.</b>

612
00:51:44,895 --> 00:51:46,605
<b>Ta Lo did this to us.</b>

613
00:51:48,398 --> 00:51:51,026
<b>They locked her behind
that gate to punish her.</b>

614
00:51:55,447 --> 00:51:56,698
<b>Don't you see?</b>

615
00:51:57,657 --> 00:51:59,743
<b>She's leaving clues for us.</b>

616
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:01,369
<b>She wants us to find her</b>

617
00:52:01,536 --> 00:52:04,289
<b>and bring her home,
so we can be a family again.</b>

618
00:52:05,165 --> 00:52:07,834
<b>Dad, Mom's gone.</b>

619
00:52:09,169 --> 00:52:11,129
<b>She's not talking to you
from behind a gate,</b>

620
00:52:11,213 --> 00:52:13,507
<b>and she's not leaving
any clues for us.</b>

621
00:52:18,845 --> 00:52:20,847
<b>Then what are these?</b>

622
00:53:07,352 --> 00:53:11,022
<b>The passage to Ta Lo
is guarded by a moving maze.</b>

623
00:53:12,065 --> 00:53:15,193
<b>But there's a direct path
through the forest</b>

624
00:53:15,277 --> 00:53:17,362
<b>that only opens once a year</b>

625
00:53:17,529 --> 00:53:19,447
<b>on Qingming Jie.</b>

626
00:53:20,407 --> 00:53:22,951
<b>To get through,
you need to know the route</b>

627
00:53:23,034 --> 00:53:25,412
<b>and the exact time it opens.</b>

628
00:53:29,833 --> 00:53:31,459
<b>Now I know both.</b>

629
00:53:43,221 --> 00:53:45,265
<b>Three days from now,</b>

630
00:53:45,432 --> 00:53:47,809
<b>we will rescue
my wife from her prison</b>

631
00:53:47,893 --> 00:53:49,102
<b>and bring her home.</b>

632
00:53:55,775 --> 00:53:57,444
<b>This is why you're here.</b>

633
00:53:58,361 --> 00:53:59,946
<b>To help me
bring her back to us.</b>

634
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:02,824
<b>And what happens if they don't
let you open the gate?</b>

635
00:54:04,451 --> 00:54:07,871
<b>We'll burn the village
to the ground.</b>

636
00:54:09,915 --> 00:54:10,916
<b>What?</b>

637
00:54:13,627 --> 00:54:15,921
<b>You can't just march
into our mom's village</b>

638
00:54:16,004 --> 00:54:17,422
<b>with this bullshit.</b>

639
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:19,299
<b>I mean, do you have
any idea how insane...</b>

640
00:54:24,638 --> 00:54:25,639
<b>Hey!</b>

641
00:54:28,516 --> 00:54:31,061
<b>Where are you taking me?</b>

642
00:54:32,437 --> 00:54:34,731
<b>When will you stop pretending?</b>

643
00:54:37,442 --> 00:54:38,610
<b>Lock them up.</b>

644
00:54:58,254 --> 00:55:01,424
<b>It's okay, my dear.</b>

645
00:55:08,348 --> 00:55:12,519
<b>We're all going to be
together soon.</b>

646
00:55:21,111 --> 00:55:25,907
<b>So, um,
pretty confused right now,</b>

647
00:55:26,074 --> 00:55:29,619
<b>because, uh, initially
I thought your dad should</b>

648
00:55:29,828 --> 00:55:31,746
<b>definitely see a therapist
for his delusions,</b>

649
00:55:31,955 --> 00:55:35,542
<b>but then that dragon
vomited a magical water map,</b>

650
00:55:36,292 --> 00:55:38,670
<b>and now I have no idea
what's real.</b>

651
00:55:41,089 --> 00:55:43,425
<b>Is what he said
about your mom's village true?</b>

652
00:55:47,137 --> 00:55:48,555
<b>She used to tell us stories
about Ta Lo</b>

653
00:55:48,638 --> 00:55:49,639
<b>when we were kids.</b>

654
00:55:50,682 --> 00:55:54,894
<b>A village in another dimension
full of magical creatures.</b>

655
00:55:54,978 --> 00:55:56,980
<b>I thought
it was just a fairy tale.</b>

656
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:00,775
<b>What if Dad's right?</b>

657
00:56:02,569 --> 00:56:03,903
<b>About Mom being locked
behind a gate</b>

658
00:56:03,987 --> 00:56:05,947
<b>by her own people?</b>

659
00:56:06,114 --> 00:56:08,366
<b>Crazier things
have turned out to be true.</b>

660
00:56:09,576 --> 00:56:11,745
<b>Look, I don't know
what the hell is going on,</b>

661
00:56:11,911 --> 00:56:14,330
<b>but if we don't find a way
to get to Ta Lo before him,</b>

662
00:56:14,497 --> 00:56:16,916
<b>he's gonna destroy everything
that's left of our family.</b>

663
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:22,088
<b>This family was destroyed
a long time ago.</b>

664
00:56:26,384 --> 00:56:28,053
<b>The hell was that?</b>

665
00:56:28,136 --> 00:56:30,305
<b>Oh.</b>

666
00:56:30,388 --> 00:56:32,640
<b>You're going
toward that noise?</b>

667
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,455
<b>"Wake Duncan
with thy knocking.</b>

668
00:56:55,622 --> 00:56:58,583
<b>"Oh, I would'st
though could'st.</b>

669
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:00,293
<b>"My deed 'twere best not..."</b>

670
00:57:03,296 --> 00:57:05,256
<b>Oh, hello, loves.</b>

671
00:57:06,382 --> 00:57:07,842
<b>What year is it?</b>

672
00:57:09,344 --> 00:57:10,720
<b>Who are you?</b>

673
00:57:10,887 --> 00:57:13,014
<b>Trevor? Slattery?</b>

674
00:57:13,181 --> 00:57:15,600
<b>The actor from Liverpool?</b>

675
00:57:16,518 --> 00:57:17,519
<b>Wait.</b>

676
00:57:17,685 --> 00:57:19,229
<b>Are you the governor's kids?</b>

677
00:57:19,896 --> 00:57:21,523
<b>I've been preparing
a monologue</b>

678
00:57:21,606 --> 00:57:23,274
<b>for your homecoming dinner.</b>

679
00:57:23,441 --> 00:57:25,318
<b>Oh. Where's she going?</b>

680
00:57:25,485 --> 00:57:26,653
<b>Why are you down here?</b>

681
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:28,780
<b>Well, some time ago,</b>

682
00:57:28,863 --> 00:57:30,406
<b>I was offered
the role of a terrorist.</b>

683
00:57:30,615 --> 00:57:32,867
<b>I know, facile, trite,
I couldn't agree more.</b>

684
00:57:33,034 --> 00:57:34,953
<b>But times were lean,
you know what I mean?</b>

685
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:37,872
<b>Anyway, the producer told me
he worked for the BBC.</b>

686
00:57:38,039 --> 00:57:39,499
<b>But, ironic twist,</b>

687
00:57:39,582 --> 00:57:42,168
<b>it turns out he, in fact,
was a terrorist,</b>

688
00:57:42,335 --> 00:57:43,837
<b>and I wasn't playing
a character at all,</b>

689
00:57:44,003 --> 00:57:45,296
<b>but what I now recognise to be</b>

690
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:47,340
<b>a rather unflattering portrait
of your father.</b>

691
00:57:47,757 --> 00:57:49,509
<b>We all got our just deserts.</b>

692
00:57:49,676 --> 00:57:51,553
<b>The producer
got blown up by Iron Man,</b>

693
00:57:51,636 --> 00:57:53,304
<b>and I served time
in federal prison,</b>

694
00:57:53,471 --> 00:57:56,307
<b>which turned out
to be the best thing for me.</b>

695
00:57:56,391 --> 00:57:58,810
<b>I got clean,
I rediscovered my passion.</b>

696
00:57:58,977 --> 00:58:01,563
<b>- Then my dad broke you out?
- Exactly.</b>

697
00:58:01,729 --> 00:58:03,815
<b>- To kill you.
- Exactly.</b>

698
00:58:04,566 --> 00:58:06,901
<b>But just as his men</b>

699
00:58:06,985 --> 00:58:09,612
<b>were tying me up
for my execution,</b>

700
00:58:09,779 --> 00:58:11,656
<b>I launched into a performance
of my Macbeth.</b>

701
00:58:11,739 --> 00:58:13,366
<b>"Whence is that knocking?
Wake Duncan</b>

702
00:58:13,449 --> 00:58:14,951
<b>"with thy knocking.
I would'st though could'st..."</b>

703
00:58:15,034 --> 00:58:16,202
<b>They couldn't
get enough of it.</b>

704
00:58:16,369 --> 00:58:18,788
<b>I've been doing weekly gigs
for the lads ever since.</b>

705
00:58:18,955 --> 00:58:20,832
<b>So you're like his jester?</b>

706
00:58:20,999 --> 00:58:22,667
<b>I can give you a quick preview
if you like.</b>

707
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:24,002
<b>"Nuncle, nuncle, nuncle..."</b>

708
00:58:24,169 --> 00:58:26,462
<b>Uh, thank you, Trevor.
I think we're okay.</b>

709
00:58:26,671 --> 00:58:28,506
<b>Right now, we really just
need to find a way to...</b>

710
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:30,008
<b>What the hell?</b>

711
00:58:30,091 --> 00:58:31,217
<b>What the... Oh!</b>

712
00:58:31,301 --> 00:58:32,343
<b>- Whoa!
- What is that?</b>

713
00:58:34,053 --> 00:58:35,054
<b>What's what?</b>

714
00:58:35,221 --> 00:58:37,015
<b>- That! What is that?
- That! That! That!</b>

715
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:40,685
<b>You can see Morris?</b>

716
00:58:40,852 --> 00:58:41,853
<b>Morris?</b>

717
00:58:41,936 --> 00:58:44,606
<b>Oh, Morris!</b>

718
00:58:44,772 --> 00:58:47,108
<b>They can see you! You're real!</b>

719
00:58:47,275 --> 00:58:50,320
<b>All this time I thought
I was hallucinating him.</b>

720
00:58:50,486 --> 00:58:51,988
<b>Oh, this is such fab news.</b>

721
00:58:53,072 --> 00:58:54,073
<b>Where's his face?</b>

722
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:57,368
<b>He's a bit sensitive
about that.</b>

723
00:58:58,494 --> 00:59:00,205
<b>Oh. Really?</b>

724
00:59:01,831 --> 00:59:03,458
<b>Morris says he knows
who you are.</b>

725
00:59:04,167 --> 00:59:05,501
<b>It talks... It talks to you?</b>

726
00:59:05,585 --> 00:59:07,128
<b>If he didn't talk to me,</b>

727
00:59:07,212 --> 00:59:09,047
<b>I'd have gone mad yonks ago.</b>

728
00:59:10,423 --> 00:59:11,799
<b>How would he know me?</b>

729
00:59:11,966 --> 00:59:14,802
<b>He says he grew up
with your mum. In Ta Lo.</b>

730
00:59:15,678 --> 00:59:18,765
<b>Apparently, your father picked
him up in some magic forest</b>

731
00:59:18,932 --> 00:59:21,643
<b>on one of his expeditions
to find the entrance.</b>

732
00:59:25,313 --> 00:59:26,898
<b>He wants you to take him home.</b>

733
00:59:29,484 --> 00:59:31,527
<b>Believe me, buddy,
I would if I knew how.</b>

734
00:59:32,237 --> 00:59:33,238
<b>According to my dad,</b>

735
00:59:33,321 --> 00:59:35,073
<b>the path there
only opens once a year.</b>

736
00:59:38,576 --> 00:59:40,745
<b>Oh.</b>

737
00:59:41,955 --> 00:59:44,540
<b>Morris says he can guide you
there right now.</b>

738
00:59:44,707 --> 00:59:45,917
<b>You can get through the maze</b>

739
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,585
<b>without waiting
for the path to open.</b>

740
00:59:47,752 --> 00:59:49,754
<b>But, and it's a big "but,"</b>

741
00:59:49,921 --> 00:59:51,965
<b>it's very dangerous.</b>

742
00:59:52,131 --> 00:59:53,132
<b>How dangerous?</b>

743
00:59:53,299 --> 00:59:55,218
<b>No one's ever
made it out alive.</b>

744
00:59:55,385 --> 00:59:58,179
<b>But Morris is 90% confident</b>

745
00:59:58,346 --> 01:00:00,098
<b>he can guide us
through safely.</b>

746
01:00:00,181 --> 01:00:01,724
<b>Oh.</b>

747
01:00:01,808 --> 01:00:03,309
<b>19%.</b>

748
01:00:05,812 --> 01:00:08,314
<b>Look, I've done dumber things
with worse odds.</b>

749
01:00:08,481 --> 01:00:10,191
<b>But even if
that chicken-pig is right...</b>

750
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:12,360
<b>...we're still locked
in your...</b>

751
01:00:18,574 --> 01:00:19,701
<b>Whew!</b>

752
01:00:22,662 --> 01:00:23,955
<b>How did you...</b>

753
01:00:24,122 --> 01:00:26,541
<b>Dad has a tunnel system
under the whole compound.</b>

754
01:00:26,708 --> 01:00:28,459
<b>That's how
I escaped last time.</b>

755
01:00:28,626 --> 01:00:29,627
<b>Oh.</b>

756
01:00:29,711 --> 01:00:31,754
<b>This will take us
straight to the garage.</b>

757
01:00:43,474 --> 01:00:45,310
<b>Oh, my God.</b>

758
01:00:45,476 --> 01:00:46,978
<b>I kinda like this guy.</b>

759
01:00:47,145 --> 01:00:48,980
<b>Just head up that ramp
and through the front gate.</b>

760
01:00:49,147 --> 01:00:50,273
<b>Should be a straight shot.</b>

761
01:00:50,356 --> 01:00:52,066
<b>Figure we got about
30 seconds until he...</b>

762
01:00:52,233 --> 01:00:53,234
<b>Do you mind?</b>

763
01:00:53,401 --> 01:00:55,361
<b>I get sick in the back.
Carsick.</b>

764
01:00:58,573 --> 01:00:59,741
<b>That's my car!</b>

765
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:06,331
<b>God damn it.</b>

766
01:01:06,497 --> 01:01:07,623
<b>Hold on.</b>

767
01:01:09,125 --> 01:01:10,168
<b>Is there another exit?</b>

<b>"How did they get those
monkeys to do those things?"</b>

789
01:02:51,352 --> 01:02:54,147
<b>And she patted me on the head

<b>"It's not real, pet.
It's just acting."</b>

<b>That's when I knew.</b>

792

<b>to act that brilliantly,</b>

794

795

<b>So you became an actor</b>

<b>Riding horses? I did. Yes.</b>

798

<b>When, in fact,</b>

799
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:19,046

<b>You found your passion

<b>- Watch your back!

837
01:05:16,914 --> 01:05:18,499
<b>- How close is it?
- 5 metres.</b>

838

<b>I'm coming home, Mummy.</b>

<b>Morris says,

<b>Now, all we have to do

<b>I'm not a threat.</b>

<b>Just an entertainer.</b>

<b>Morris can vouch for me.</b>

880

<b>Why would he think that?</b>

<b>She told him.</b>

<b>He says he can hear her

<b>What do they have to do

<b>Thousands of years ago,</b>

<b>all of our people

<b>until the attack

<b>devouring every soul

904

<b>and with each kill,

905
01:11:48,681 --> 01:11:51,225
<b>After decimating
our largest cities,</b>

906

<b>they were headed to

907

<b>The leaders of Ta Lo sent

<b>to stop them from reaching

<b>Until The Great Protector</b>

<b>joined their fight

912

<b>Together, they pushed
the Dweller and his army</b>

913

<b>into the Dark Gate</b>

914

<b>and locked it behind them.</b>

<b>Your father isn't the first

01:12:55,330 --> 01:12:57,666
<b>and they all had one thing
in common.</b>

924
01:12:57,833 --> 01:12:58,834
<b>They were lured here</b>

925
01:12:58,917 --> 01:13:01,045
<b>by the voice of something
on the other side.</b>

926
01:13:01,837 --> 01:13:04,715
<b>A voice that promised them
their greatest desires.</b>

927
01:13:07,176 --> 01:13:11,346
<b>So you think soul eaters
are talking to our dad?</b>

928
01:13:12,139 --> 01:13:15,476
<b>They know The Ten Rings have
the power to break them free.</b>

929
01:13:19,813 --> 01:13:20,814
<b>Oh.</b>

930
01:13:23,442 --> 01:13:25,027
<b>Here you go.</b>

931
01:13:25,277 --> 01:13:26,278
<b>Oh.</b>

932
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:28,280
<b>To the range.</b>

933
01:13:29,448 --> 01:13:31,492
<b>What? Okay.</b>

934
01:13:32,242 --> 01:13:34,912
<b>Um, looks like I'm gonna go
deliver some dragon arrows.</b>

935
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:36,538
<b>Oh, you're gonna deliver
some dragon arrows?</b>

936
01:13:36,622 --> 01:13:37,915
<b>Yeah.
Make myself useful, you know.</b>

937
01:13:38,082 --> 01:13:39,083
<b>Thank you.</b>

938
01:13:41,126 --> 01:13:42,836
<b>Let's go see your mother.</b>

939
01:13:57,518 --> 01:14:00,104
<b>I just love how you guys know
exactly what you wanna do,</b>

940
01:14:00,312 --> 01:14:03,107
<b>and you spend your whole life
getting really good at it.</b>

941
01:14:03,273 --> 01:14:04,858
<b>I wish I was more like that.</b>

942
01:14:05,025 --> 01:14:07,111
<b>It's like every time I get
moderately good at something,</b>

943
01:14:07,277 --> 01:14:09,530
<b>I just quit
and start something new.</b>

944
01:14:09,696 --> 01:14:11,615
<b>But I just know my own limits,</b>

945
01:14:11,782 --> 01:14:14,409
<b>and I'm not gonna waste
my time chasing something</b>

946
01:14:14,493 --> 01:14:16,328
<b>that will ultimately be
a disappointment for me.</b>

947
01:14:16,411 --> 01:14:17,454
<b>That's not me.</b>

948
01:14:17,538 --> 01:14:18,997
<b>Guang Bo.</b>

949
01:14:20,249 --> 01:14:21,583
<b>Let her shoot.</b>

950
01:14:24,962 --> 01:14:28,632
<b>If you aim at nothing,
you hit nothing.</b>

951
01:14:52,114 --> 01:14:53,740
<b>You were everything to her.</b>

952
01:14:55,409 --> 01:14:57,870
<b>She knew that one day
you would find your way here</b>

953
01:14:58,036 --> 01:15:00,789
<b>and asked me to prepare
something for your arrival.</b>

954
01:15:23,353 --> 01:15:25,272
<b>After losing someone like her,</b>

955
01:15:25,355 --> 01:15:27,983
<b>it's easy to feel alone
in this world.</b>

956
01:15:28,650 --> 01:15:30,319
<b>But you're not.</b>

957
01:15:30,485 --> 01:15:32,738
<b>You are children
of this family,</b>

958
01:15:33,322 --> 01:15:35,657
<b>and I welcome you home.</b>

959
01:16:03,310 --> 01:16:05,145
<b>You're not
in your father's house any more.</b>

960
01:16:06,897 --> 01:16:11,026
<b>In Ta Lo, we train as equals.</b>

961
01:16:12,778 --> 01:16:16,657
<b>You've been in the shadows
long enough, my child.</b>

962
01:16:36,051 --> 01:16:37,261
<b>Guang Bo, you saw that?</b>

963
01:16:38,011 --> 01:16:39,346
<b>That was tight!</b>

964
01:16:52,734 --> 01:16:54,653
<b>My mother was the only one
who could beat him.</b>

965
01:16:56,238 --> 01:16:58,031
<b>Show me how she did it.</b>

966
01:17:05,289 --> 01:17:06,790
<b>No, sorry.</b>

967
01:17:06,957 --> 01:17:08,542
<b>Sorry. Offside, offside.</b>

968
01:18:09,269 --> 01:18:11,480
<b>Your mother knew
who she was.</b>

969
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:13,398
<b>Do you?</b>

970
01:19:19,423 --> 01:19:22,467
<b>You are a product
of all who came before you.</b>

971
01:19:23,427 --> 01:19:27,264
<b>The legacy of your family,
the good and the bad,</b>

972
01:19:28,056 --> 01:19:30,392
<b>it is all a part
of who you are.</b>

973
01:19:34,771 --> 01:19:36,857
<b>Stop hiding, nephew.</b>

974
01:19:37,691 --> 01:19:39,734
<b>It only prolongs the pain.</b>

975
01:20:12,184 --> 01:20:14,728
<b>We'll be together soon.</b>

976
01:20:21,151 --> 01:20:22,152
<b>Sir.</b>

977
01:20:24,821 --> 01:20:26,323
<b>The men are ready.</b>

978
01:20:27,365 --> 01:20:29,159
<b>The passage will open at dawn.</b>

979
01:20:30,118 --> 01:20:31,745
<b>I'll prepare the vehicles.</b>

980
01:20:55,894 --> 01:20:57,854
<b>Lead with your breath.</b>

981
01:20:58,313 --> 01:21:01,274
<b>Look into your heart,</b>

982
01:21:01,441 --> 01:21:04,778
<b>the light and the dark.</b>

983
01:21:04,945 --> 01:21:09,032
<b>To know yourself,</b>

984
01:21:09,199 --> 01:21:13,119
<b>you must face them both.</b>

985
01:21:28,218 --> 01:21:30,136
<b>Your husband tried to destroy us.</b>

986
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:33,390
<b>The Iron Gang is here
to repay that debt.</b>

987
01:21:34,015 --> 01:21:35,934
<b>My husband is not the man
he used to be.</b>

988
01:21:36,726 --> 01:21:38,103
<b>It doesn't matter.</b>

989
01:21:39,354 --> 01:21:42,607
<b>Your business with him has nothing
to do with my children.</b>

990
01:21:45,527 --> 01:21:47,404
<b>They can go,</b>

991
01:21:47,571 --> 01:21:51,366
<b>but someone has to pay.</b>

992
01:21:56,037 --> 01:21:57,872
<b>Xialing. Shang-Chi.</b>

993
01:21:58,039 --> 01:21:59,040
<b>Go inside.</b>

994
01:21:59,165 --> 01:22:01,960
<b>I'm going to talk to our guests.</b>

995
01:22:07,966 --> 01:22:10,802
<b>But you don't have your powers.</b>

996
01:22:13,513 --> 01:22:15,557
<b>Shang-Chi, you have nothing to fear.</b>

997
01:23:37,806 --> 01:23:39,015
<b>Mama.</b>

998
01:23:41,643 --> 01:23:42,811
<b>Mama.</b>

999
01:24:01,329 --> 01:24:02,539
<b>Papa.</b>

1000
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:14,884
<b>She told me I could change.</b>

1001
01:24:16,386 --> 01:24:19,639
<b>That I could leave my past behind.</b>

1002
01:24:22,058 --> 01:24:24,561
<b>But she was wrong.</b>

1003
01:24:27,772 --> 01:24:30,400
<b>If I hadn't taken them off,</b>

1004
01:24:31,317 --> 01:24:35,280
<b>those men wouldn't have
dared to do this.</b>

1005
01:24:37,741 --> 01:24:40,493
<b>And now they will pay for it.</b>

1006
01:25:34,923 --> 01:25:35,965
<b>Where's your boss?</b>

1007
01:25:36,424 --> 01:25:37,425
<b>I don't know!</b>

1008
01:25:37,842 --> 01:25:39,427
<b>I swear I don't!</b>

1009
01:25:41,012 --> 01:25:42,597
<b>Okay.</b>

1010
01:25:55,944 --> 01:26:00,698
<b>A blood debt has to be
paid by blood.</b>

1011
01:26:01,533 --> 01:26:03,326
<b>Will you help me?</b>

1012
01:26:33,273 --> 01:26:34,482
<b>We found the man</b>

1013
01:26:34,566 --> 01:26:36,651
<b>responsible for killing
your mother.</b>

1014
01:26:37,861 --> 01:26:40,947
<b>It is your right
to finish this for both of us.</b>

1015
01:26:42,073 --> 01:26:43,700
<b>And when you return,</b>

1016
01:26:43,867 --> 01:26:47,370
<b>we will rebuild The Ten Rings
to what it once was.</b>

1017
01:27:08,892 --> 01:27:10,518
<b>Been looking
everywhere for ya.</b>

1018
01:27:18,443 --> 01:27:19,652
<b>You okay?</b>

1019
01:27:24,032 --> 01:27:27,410
<b>I'm not who you think I am.</b>

1020
01:27:27,577 --> 01:27:29,412
<b>You already apologised
for that. We're good...</b>

1021
01:27:29,579 --> 01:27:31,539
<b>That's not what
I'm talking about.</b>

1022
01:27:33,833 --> 01:27:35,043
<b>Okay.</b>

1023
01:27:36,628 --> 01:27:38,421
<b>What... What is it?</b>

1024
01:27:44,010 --> 01:27:48,848
<b>When my dad sent me to find
the man who killed my mom...</b>

1025
01:27:51,559 --> 01:27:53,770
<b>I told you
I couldn't go through with it.</b>

1026
01:27:58,816 --> 01:28:00,318
<b>I lied.</b>

1027
01:28:04,572 --> 01:28:06,866
<b>I thought that
I could change my name,</b>

1028
01:28:07,033 --> 01:28:09,953
<b>start a new life, pretend like
it never happened.</b>

1029
01:28:10,119 --> 01:28:11,329
<b>But...</b>

1030
01:28:18,252 --> 01:28:20,505
<b>She would hate
the person I've become.</b>

1031
01:28:27,220 --> 01:28:29,430
<b>Your dad trained you
to be an assassin</b>

1032
01:28:29,514 --> 01:28:31,432
<b>when you were 7.</b>

1033
01:28:32,183 --> 01:28:35,770
<b>He sent you on a hit at 14.</b>

1034
01:28:37,730 --> 01:28:40,108
<b>You realise how messed up
that is, right?</b>

1035
01:28:43,736 --> 01:28:46,239
<b>My mom is dead because of him.</b>

1036
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:51,953
<b>And now he's coming
to destroy her home.</b>

1037
01:29:01,337 --> 01:29:04,590
<b>A blood debt
has to be paid by blood.</b>

1038
01:29:07,510 --> 01:29:09,262
<b>What are you saying?</b>

1039
01:29:12,807 --> 01:29:15,018
<b>I'm gonna do
what he trained me to do.</b>

1040
01:29:21,024 --> 01:29:22,567
<b>I'm gonna kill him.</b>

1041
01:30:10,031 --> 01:30:11,032
<b>He's here.</b>

1042
01:30:23,377 --> 01:30:24,378
<b>No!</b>

1043
01:30:24,462 --> 01:30:25,713
<b>You're not ready.</b>

1044
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:27,924
<b>She stays here.</b>

1045
01:31:21,644 --> 01:31:23,229
<b>Are you here
to help the people</b>

1046
01:31:23,312 --> 01:31:25,773
<b>holding your own mother
captive?</b>

1047
01:31:26,190 --> 01:31:27,775
<b>She isn't back there.</b>

1048
01:31:28,151 --> 01:31:29,152
<b>You're being lied to</b>

1049
01:31:29,235 --> 01:31:31,404
<b>by a creature
who wants to destroy us all.</b>

1050
01:31:32,864 --> 01:31:34,949
<b>Is that what they told you?</b>

1051
01:31:35,533 --> 01:31:38,161
<b>I know my wife's voice.</b>

1052
01:31:38,369 --> 01:31:40,913
<b>I miss my sister
as much as you do,</b>

1053
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:43,666
<b>but this is not the way
to honour her memory.</b>

1054
01:31:43,833 --> 01:31:45,626
<b>Did you honour her
when you turned her away</b>

1055
01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:46,711
<b>from your gate?</b>

1056
01:31:46,836 --> 01:31:49,338
<b>You fool. We turned you away.</b>

1057
01:31:49,505 --> 01:31:52,049
<b>The sins of your past would have
destroyed this place.</b>

1058
01:31:52,383 --> 01:31:56,679
<b>Be careful how you speak to me,
young man.</b>

1059
01:31:57,096 --> 01:32:00,892
<b>I've lived 10 of your lifetimes.</b>

1060
01:32:02,435 --> 01:32:04,061
<b>Let me pass.</b>

1061
01:32:04,395 --> 01:32:06,439
<b>We cannot do that.</b>

1062
01:32:25,416 --> 01:32:26,584
<b>Burn it down.</b>

1063
01:33:30,523 --> 01:33:31,649
<b>Stop him!</b>

1064
01:34:07,268 --> 01:34:10,271
<b>Are you planning to stop me
all by yourself?</b>

1065
01:34:14,608 --> 01:34:16,027
<b>I'm not afraid of you.</b>

1066
01:34:23,326 --> 01:34:24,535
<b>Yes, you are.</b>

1067
01:34:30,166 --> 01:34:33,586
<b>You've spent
your entire life afraid.</b>

1068
01:34:33,753 --> 01:34:35,796
<b>Always running,</b>

1069
01:34:35,963 --> 01:34:37,256
<b>always hiding.</b>

1070
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:54,648
<b>You were there
when they came for her,</b>

1071
01:34:54,815 --> 01:34:56,984
<b>and you did nothing.</b>

1072
01:34:57,568 --> 01:35:00,446
<b>You stood at a window
and watched her die!</b>

1073
01:35:35,272 --> 01:35:36,982
<b>She was gone
and we needed you.</b>

1074
01:35:38,192 --> 01:35:41,404
<b>But you chose those damn rings
over us.</b>

1075
01:35:45,491 --> 01:35:46,992
<b>You trained your son
to be a killer.</b>

1076

<b>Is this what you wanted?</b>

1077

<b>You think

1098

<b>That was just the beginning.</b>

1106
01:39:17,995 --> 01:39:19,705
<b>I was hoping you knew.</b>

1107
01:39:27,588 --> 01:39:28,589

<b>Get out of my way, boy.</b>

1122

<b>She's calling to me.</b>

1128

1133
01:49:58,176 --> 01:49:59,469
<b>It's headed for the village!</b>

1134

<b>If it gets our dragon's soul,</b>

1135

1136
01:51:56,795 --> 01:51:58,296
<b>Aim for the throat!</b>

1137
01:52:46,636 --> 01:52:48,430

1138
01:52:55,687 --> 01:52:57,230

<b>They were more than warriors.</b>

1146

<b>our sisters and brothers.</b>

1148

1151
01:56:38,201 --> 01:56:39,827
<b>Mum, we'll be okay.</b>

1152
01:56:42,205 --> 01:56:43,998
<b>A thousand years ago,</b>

1153
01:56:44,457 --> 01:56:46,793

<b>And I'd only learned
how to shoot a bow,</b>

1157
01:57:36,050 --> 01:57:37,301
<b>like, a day earlier,</b>

1158
01:57:37,468 --> 01:57:38,594
<b>now I'm on a battlefield,</b>

1159
01:57:38,678 --> 01:57:40,972
<b>killing all these Soul Suckers

1161
01:57:43,516 --> 01:57:44,934
<b>And I'm hanging on
to The Great Protector</b>

1162
01:57:45,017 --> 01:57:46,018
<b>with my sister at this point,</b>

1163
01:57:46,102 --> 01:57:48,104
<b>trying not to get eaten
by the Mega Soul Sucker.</b>

1164
01:57:48,271 --> 01:57:50,565
<b>Oh, the Mega Soul Sucker
was such a nasty bitch.</b>

1165
01:57:50,732 --> 01:57:52,233
<b>Yeah. It was trying
to eat our dragon's soul.</b>

1166
01:57:52,316 --> 01:57:53,317
<b>Which would have
allowed it</b>

1167
01:57:53,401 --> 01:57:54,444
<b>to destroy
the entire universe.</b>

1168
01:57:54,527 --> 01:57:55,528
<b>Yeah.</b>

1169
01:57:55,611 --> 01:57:56,779
<b>I only had
one arrow left,</b>

1170
01:57:56,863 --> 01:57:58,740
<b>and all I could hear
in the back of my mind</b>

1171
01:57:58,906 --> 01:58:00,366
<b>was my mom's voice saying,</b>

1172
01:58:00,533 --> 01:58:02,744
<b>"Just take the shot,
you little mooch!"</b>

1173
01:58:02,910 --> 01:58:05,413
<b>And so, I aimed
right for the Sucker's throat</b>

1174
01:58:05,496 --> 01:58:07,415
<b>- and I let her fly.
- She hit it dead on.</b>

1175
01:58:07,749 --> 01:58:09,083
<b>And then Shaun used
the Ten Rings</b>

1176
01:58:09,167 --> 01:58:11,836
<b>to do this crazy
Kamehameha fireball</b>

1177
01:58:11,919 --> 01:58:13,463
<b>that exploded the thing...</b>

1178
01:58:13,546 --> 01:58:15,465
<b>...and he saved the world.</b>

1179
01:58:16,799 --> 01:58:19,635
<b>Yeah, we, uh, lost
some good people that day...</b>

1180
01:58:21,804 --> 01:58:23,139
<b>but we made it.</b>

1181
01:58:23,639 --> 01:58:25,016
<b>We made it.</b>

1182
01:58:26,726 --> 01:58:28,186
<b>Are you done mocking me?</b>

1183
01:58:28,394 --> 01:58:30,229
<b>Oh, no. We're not mocking you.</b>

1184
01:58:30,396 --> 01:58:31,773
<b>So where is this sister
of yours?</b>

1185
01:58:31,939 --> 01:58:33,858
<b>She's back
at my dad's compound,</b>

1186
01:58:33,941 --> 01:58:35,109
<b>shutting down his operations.</b>

1187
01:58:35,276 --> 01:58:36,861
<b>Yeah, his dad was the head
of The Ten Rings</b>

1188
01:58:36,944 --> 01:58:38,446
<b>for the past thousand years.</b>

1189
01:58:39,989 --> 01:58:42,033
<b>2 weeks ago, you were

<b>and you want me to believe
you're now saving the world</b>

1191
01:58:44,660 --> 01:58:46,454
<b>from soul-sucking monsters?</b>

1192
01:58:47,121 --> 01:58:48,372
<b>I know, you're trying
to get me back</b>

1193
01:58:48,456 --> 01:58:50,124
<b>for what I said last time,

<b>...for speaking the truth

1195
01:58:52,794 --> 01:58:55,421
<b>I really meant what I said,
