1
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:29,404
Ta-da!

2
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:30,948
Ta-da!

3
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:32,157
Ta-da!

4
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:33,742
- Ta-da! Ta...
- Ta-da!

5
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,120
Ta-da!

6
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:38,622
Ta-da!

7
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:02,706
Huh?

8
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:18,490
Three weeks, and we're still
no closer to cracking this.

9
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,493
Right, bring him in!

10
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,911
Yes, sir.

11
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,146
This is the best party ever!

12
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,203
Yeah!

13
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,958
Ha!

14
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,427
Oh, no! A dragon is approaching!

15
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:30,020
Fear not, for here come
the gallant knights to save us.

16
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,188
Yay!

17
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,665
No, no, no. What do you
mean she's not coming?

18
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,585
I have a backyard full
of these little girls

19
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:57,798
who are counting on a visit
from a fairy princess.

20
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:00,717
Hurts! Stop it!

21
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:08,642
Listen! I don't want a refund,
I want the fairy princess,

22
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:11,102
Please, please, I'm begging you.

23
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,605
You know what? I hope
that you can sleep at night,

24
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:16,107
you crusher of little girls' dreams!

25
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:17,359
Ooh, ooh!

26
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,819
When's the fairy princess coming?

27
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,530
Any minute now!

28
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,573
Yay!

29
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,242
Stall them!

30
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:30,580
Ooh!

31
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,093
Whoa! Whoa, okay!
Okay, all right.

32
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,803
That's enough of the magic show.

33
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:45,929
Aw!

34
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:50,183
Wait, did you hear that?

35
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,979
It sounded like the twinkling
sounds of magical fairy dust.

36
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,523
It's the fairy princess!
She's coming!

37
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,692
Look!

38
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,578
Huh? Oh!
Eh?

39
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,916
Ow!

40
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,461
Ow.

41
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:29,931
It is I, Gruzinkerbell,

42
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:34,436
the most magical fairy princess of all!

43
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:38,607
And I am here to wish Princess Agnes

44
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,984
a very happy birthday!

45
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,986
How come you're so fat?

46
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,363
Because

47
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:48,074
my house is made of candy,

48
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:52,078
and sometimes I eat instead
of facing my problems!

49
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,664
How come you have...

50
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,499
Okay, time for cake.

51
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,792
Yay!

52
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:04,633
Thank you, Gruzinkerbell!
You're the best fairy princess ever!

53
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:08,053
You are welcome, little girl!

54
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:14,184
I know it's really you, Gru.
I'm just pretending for the other kids.

55
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,816
Hey there, Gru. Mr. Life of the Party!

56
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,443
Hello, Jillian.

57
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:26,696
So, I'm gonna go out on a limb here,

58
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:32,827
but my friend Natalie
is recently single, and... Oop.

59
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:35,705
No, no, no, get off the limb right now.
No limb.

60
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,166
Come on, she's a riot!

61
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:41,294
She sings karaoke,
she has a lot of free time,

62
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,047
looks aren't that important to her...

63
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:48,218
No, Jills, that is not happening.
Seriously, I'm fine.

64
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:50,762
Okay, fine, forget Natalie.
How about my cousin Linda?

65
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:51,930
No!

66
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,724
Oh! Oh! I know someone
whose husband just died...

67
00:07:57,394 --> 00:08:00,021
I'm sorry, I did not see you there.

68
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:03,316
Or there.

69
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:15,078
Kyle? Kyle?

70
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,580
Kyle, no! Do not do your
business on the petunias!

71
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,919
There you go.
Those are Fred's, go crazy.

72
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,383
Good boy!

73
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,592
Mr. Gru?

74
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:30,844
I didn't... What? Yes?

75
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,932
Hi! Agent Lucy Wilde of the AVL.

76
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:39,269
Oh, whoops!

77
00:08:39,394 --> 00:08:41,730
Sorry, you're gonna have to come with me.

78
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:44,274
Oh, sorry, I... Freeze ray!

79
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,071
You know, you really should announce

80
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:52,115
your weapons after you
fire them, Mr. Gru.

81
00:08:52,323 --> 00:08:53,700
For example...

82
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,663
Lipstick taser!

83
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,374
Oh, it works so good.

84
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:12,052
Man!

85
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:15,305
Large person.

86
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,772
Oh, sorry.

87
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,819
- Get in there...
- Huh?

88
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,655
...you big man!

89
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:39,579
Boss!

90
00:09:53,635 --> 00:09:54,677
Uh? Huh!

91
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:00,850
Whoa!

92
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:03,436
Huh?

93
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,188
Ah! Whoo!

94
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,482
Ooh!

95
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,210
Oh!

96
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:30,630
Huh? Ah. Quack, quack!

97
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,995
Wow!

98
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:31,251
What? Where?

99
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,254
Whoa, foot is asleep.

100
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:37,465
Ah, pins and needles!

101
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,384
Good afternoon, Mr. Gru.

102
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:40,551
Eh.

103
00:12:40,677 --> 00:12:43,513
I apologize for our methods
in getting you here.

104
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:46,266
I don't. I'd do it again in a heartbeat.

105
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,017
I am not gonna lie, I enjoyed that.

106
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,728
Every second of it.
Gave me a bit of a buzz, actually.

107
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,563
That's enough, Agent Wilde.

108
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:53,940
Sorry, sir.

109
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:55,566
Okay, this is bogus!

110
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,821
I don't know who you people
think you are, but...

111
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:02,365
We are the Anti-Villain League.

112
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:07,912
An ultra-secret organization dedicated
to fighting crime on a global scale.

113
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:13,126
Rob a bank, we're not interested.
Kill someone, not our deal.

114
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:18,047
But you want to melt the polar ice caps,
or vaporize Mount Fuji,

115
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:21,801
or even steal the Moon...

116
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:24,220
Then we notice.

117
00:13:24,429 --> 00:13:27,265
First of all, you got
no proof that I did that.

118
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:31,185
Second, after I did do that,
I put it back!

119
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:32,979
We're well aware of that, Mr. Gru.

120
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,064
That's why we brought you here.

121
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:39,193
I am the League's director,
Silas Ramsbottom.

122
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:40,903
Bottom.

123
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:46,534
Hilarious.

124
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,286
Agent Wilde?

125
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:49,746
Oh, me now? Ah.

126
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,831
Um, recently, an entire top-secret lab

127
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,791
disappeared from the Arctic Circle.

128
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:57,378
Yeah, the entire lab, just...

129
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,589
Gone. Where did it go?

130
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:01,090
I don't care.

131
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,676
Hmm. The lab was devoted to experiments

132
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,013
involving PX-41, a transmutation serum.

133
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:11,100
What is PX-41, you ask?
Mmm, it's pretty bad. Look.

134
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:22,278
Ah!

135
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,748
Huh, you usually don't
see that in bunnies.

136
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:37,835
As you can see, in the wrong
hands, the PX-41 serum

137
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,005
could be the most devastating
weapon on Earth.

138
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:47,261
Fortunately, it has a very
distinct chemical footprint.

139
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:50,431
And using the latest
chem-tracking technology,

140
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,684
we found traces of it
in the Paradise Mall.

141
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,144
A mall?

142
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,855
Precisely. And we believe
that one of these

143
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:00,400
shop owners is a master criminal.

144
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:01,692
And that's where you come in.

145
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:06,155
As an ex-villain, you know how
a villain thinks, how a villain acts.

146
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,241
The plan is to set you up undercover

147
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:10,284
at a shop in the mall, where hopefully...

148
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,287
Okay, I see where this is going,

149
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:16,707
with all the <i>Mission:
Impossible</i> stuff, but no. No!

150
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:20,503
I'm a father now.
And a legitimate businessman.

151
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:24,298
I am developing a line
of delicious jams and jellies.

152
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,760
"Jams and jellies"?

153
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:30,763
Oh, attitude!
That's right!

154
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:32,807
So, thanks, but no thanks.

155
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:38,688
And here's a tip. Instead of tazing
people and kidnapping them,

156
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:41,357
maybe you should just give them a call!

157
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,693
Good day, Mr. Sheepsbutt.

158
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:45,027
Ramsbottom.

159
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,029
Oh, yeah, like that's any better.

160
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:49,240
Hello.

161
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,212
Look, I probably shouldn't be saying this,

162
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,215
but your work as a villain
was kind of amazing.

163
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:10,553
So, if you ever wanna get back
to doing something awesome,

164
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,347
give us a call.

165
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,785
Hey, I told you guys to get to bed.

166
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,078
Oh, sorry.

167
00:16:36,204 --> 00:16:37,705
So, when you going on your date?

168
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:38,956
What?

169
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,125
Remember, Miss Jillian said
she was arranging a date for you.

170
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,254
Yeah, well, she is a nut job,
and I'm not going on any date.

171
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,465
Why not? Are you scared?

172
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,391
Hey, did you guys see
the Moon landing on TV?

173
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:00,102
Yeah, I can't believe it.
It's so cool!

174
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,646
Excuse me? Lisa?

175
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:02,980
I was talking to Billy the other day.

176
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,148
No way!

177
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,566
He is so cute.

178
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:08,736
Ah. Hey, Lisa, I was wondering if you...

179
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:13,074
Ew! Gru touched Lisa!
Gru touched Lisa!

180
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:14,450
Ew!

181
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,827
Lisa's got Gruties!

182
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:28,089
Scared? Of what? Women?
No! That's bonkers!

183
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:32,426
I just have no interest in going
on a date, that's all. Case closed.

184
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,846
I'm not scared.
Of women. Or dates.

185
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:37,557
Let's go to bed.

186
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,351
Good night, Edith.

187
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:44,063
Good night, Margo.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

188
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:46,065
Hold the horses. Who are you texting?

189
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,775
No one. Just my friend Avery.

190
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:52,655
Avery. Avery? Is that a girl's
name or a boy's name?

191
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,115
Does it matter?

192
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:57,535
No, no, it doesn't matter
unless it's a boy!

193
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,996
I know what makes you a boy.

194
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,205
Uh, ooh,

195
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,082
you do?

196
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,334
Your bald head.

197
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,004
Oh, yes.

198
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,172
It's really smooth.

199
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:13,884
Sometimes I stare at it,
and imagine a little chick popping out.

200
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:15,886
Peep peep peep.

201
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,848
Good night, Agnes.

202
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:22,059
Never get older.

203
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,595
Hey, oh!

204
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:00,056
Uh...

205
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,391
Okay, okay.

206
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,132
Hey, Tim, nice haircut!

207
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:39,762
Donnie, hang in there, baby!
It's almost Friday.

208
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,556
So, how's today's batch, Dr. Nefario?

209
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,350
I developed a new formula

210
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,268
which allowed me to get every known

211
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:49,188
kind of berry into one flavor of jelly.

212
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,360
That tastes good!

213
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:57,113
I love the flavor of that!

214
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,364
It's horrible, isn't it?

215
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,782
No, no!

216
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:02,827
Oh, we're making great progress!

217
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,286
Here, try some of this.

218
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:05,454
Mmm.

219
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:09,625
Ah.

220
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:16,716
Whoa.

221
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:21,804
Okay, just because everybody hates it,
doesn't mean it's not good!

222
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,723
Listen, Gru,

223
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,391
there's something I've been meaning

224
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,184
to talk to you about for some time now.

225
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,103
What? What's wrong?

226
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:30,438
Um...

227
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:34,400
I miss being evil.

228
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:38,654
Sinister plots, large-scale crimes,
it's what I live for.

229
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:43,576
I mean, don't you think there's
more to our future than jelly?

230
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:46,871
Well, I'm also considering
a line of jams.

231
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,332
Um, the thing is, Gru,

232
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,669
I've had an offer
of employment elsewhere.

233
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,088
Dr. Nefario!

234
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,215
Come on, you're kidding, right?

235
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,384
It's a great opportunity for me.

236
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,262
Bigger lab, more evil,

237
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:05,181
full dental.

238
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:14,982
Very well.

239
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:18,694
Let us give you the proper send-off.

240
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:20,404
Minions!

241
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:29,246
The highest honor awarded to Dr. Nefario

242
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:32,166
for your years of service,

243
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:35,711
the 21 -fart gun salute!

244
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,056
Uh, I counted 22.

245
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:55,231
Farewell, my friends.

246
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,960
This may take a while.

247
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,587
Go about your business.

248
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:23,425
I miss you already!

249
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:05,968
Huh?

250
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:11,098
Huh.

251
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,649
Are you sure we should be doing this?

252
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,818
Yes, it's for his own good.

253
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:25,487
Okay, we need to choose a picture.

254
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:26,614
No.

255
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:27,990
Scary.

256
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,241
Weird.

257
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:32,202
What is that?

258
00:23:32,286 --> 00:23:34,997
Good morning, girls!
I have an announcement to make.

259
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:37,041
Hey, what celebrity do you look like?

260
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,460
Uh, Bruce Willis.

261
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:41,128
Mmm, no.

262
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:42,880
Humpty Dumpty!

263
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,506
Ooh, Gollum!

264
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:47,968
Okay, what are you doing?

265
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:49,970
We're signing you up for online dating!

266
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:52,848
Oh, okay. What? No, no, no.

267
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:54,808
Oh, come on. It's fun.

268
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:56,769
And it's time for you to get out there.

269
00:23:56,852 --> 00:24:00,064
No! Stop! No one is ever
getting out there! Ever!

270
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:03,359
- Oh!
- Okay, now for the announcement.

271
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:05,861
I have accepted a new job.

272
00:24:05,945 --> 00:24:07,196
Whoa! Really?

273
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,783
Yes, I have been recruited
by a top-secret agency

274
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,202
to go undercover and save the world!

275
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,620
You're gonna be a spy?

276
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,580
That's right, baby!

277
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,540
Gru's back in the game.

278
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:22,336
With gadgets and weapons and cool cars.
The whole deal.

279
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,545
Awesome!

280
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:25,923
Are you really gonna save the world?

281
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:29,510
Yes. Yes, I am.

282
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,243
Ah!

283
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:01,917
Hmm.

284
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:04,378
"Bake My Day."

285
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,255
Blech.

286
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:18,726
All right, here is the cupcake
recipe I got off the Internet.

287
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,858
And don't go nuts with the sprinkles!

288
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:48,464
Whoo.

289
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:51,592
I wasn't expecting that.
Or was I?

290
00:25:52,593 --> 00:25:55,971
Ooh. You got a little...

291
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,808
Here, I'll get it.

292
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,226
Oh.

293
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,895
It's just spreading.

294
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,314
All right, all right.
I got it! Stop it!

295
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:06,815
Oh.

296
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:07,941
I'll let you get it.

297
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:11,862
Yeah, what you just
saw there was a little

298
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,614
something new I've been working on.

299
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:17,618
It's a combination of Jujitsu,
Krav Maga, Aztec warfare

300
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,870
and krumping.

301
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,664
Okay, that's weird. Why are you here?

302
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:25,417
On assignment from Silas.
I'm your new partner.

303
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:26,752
Yay!

304
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,505
What? No, no "yay."

305
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,257
Ramsbottom didn't say
anything about a partner.

306
00:26:32,341 --> 00:26:34,259
Well, it seems that because
of your checkered past,

307
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:36,095
everyone else refused to work with you.

308
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:38,555
But not me. I stepped up.

309
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:42,184
And I'm new, so I kind of have
to do what they tell me anyway.

310
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:43,894
Walla!

311
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,356
Ya!

312
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:48,816
Aah!

313
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:50,317
Do you know this guy?

314
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,486
Yes, he's one of my minions.

315
00:26:52,903 --> 00:26:54,404
Oh, I'm sorry.

316
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:56,532
I should have known.

317
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,367
You are free to go.

318
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:06,750
Uh? Ah!

319
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:15,134
<i>Kampai!</i>

320
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:30,858
Oh!

321
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:32,025
<i>Dave...</i>

322
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:35,279
Earth to Dave!

323
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:36,572
Huh?

324
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:38,157
You can leave now.

325
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,283
Oh, uh...

326
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,126
So, what do we got?
Who's on the list?

327
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:50,544
Fire them at me.

328
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:53,672
First suspect, Hedda Blumentoft,

329
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:55,632
proprietor of Mum's the Word Floral Shop.

330
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:57,509
No, not her.

331
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,219
Okay, moving on...

332
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:02,139
Chuck Kinney, owner of Stuff-A-Bear.

333
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:05,309
Ooh.

334
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:06,602
I don't think so.

335
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:08,562
Hello?

336
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:14,443
<i>Buenos días,</i> my friends!

337
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,237
I am Eduardo Perez,

338
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:20,616
owner of <i>Salsa y Salsa</i>
restaurant, across the mall.

339
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:23,744
Now open for breakfast.
And you are?

340
00:28:23,911 --> 00:28:26,622
Gru. And this is Lucy.
And we are closed.

341
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,916
This is just going to take <i>un momento</i>.

342
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,460
I am throwing a big <i>Cinco de Mayo</i> party,

343
00:28:31,627 --> 00:28:35,631
and I am going to need
200 of your best cupcakes

344
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:39,551
decorated with the Mexican flag.

345
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,345
It looks something like this.

346
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,348
What do you think?

347
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,308
- Ooh.
- Oh.

348
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,559
Look away!

349
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:48,644
You, whoo.

350
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:53,815
Anyway, I have to go. It's all settled.
I'll pick them up next week!

351
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:57,819
Have a good day. Come by
if you get a chance, okay?

352
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:04,576
And welcome to the mall family.

353
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,627
El Macho.

354
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,087
What?

355
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,338
But it couldn't be.

356
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,006
What? What couldn't be?

357
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:24,554
That guy looks exactly like
a villain named El Macho.

358
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,515
From about 20 years ago.

359
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:34,022
<i>He was ruthless!</i>

360
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,691
<i>He was dangerous.</i>

361
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:39,695
<i>And as the name implies, very macho.</i>

362
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:55,043
<i>He had a reputation for pulling off
heists using only his bare hands!</i>

363
00:29:57,087 --> 00:30:02,175
<i>But sadly, like all the greats,
El Macho was gone too soon.</i>

364
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:05,554
<i>He died in the most macho way possible.</i>

365
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,389
<i>Riding a shark</i>

366
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:11,643
<i>with 250 pounds of dynamite
strapped to his chest</i>

367
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:15,897
<i>into the mouth of an active volcano!</i>

368
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:19,985
<i>It was glorious.</i>

369
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:25,240
Yeah, sounds like El Macho's pretty dead.

370
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,784
They never found the body.
Oh, no.

371
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:33,081
All that was ever retrieved
was a pile of singed chest hair.

372
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:36,793
But that face! It has got to be El Macho!

373
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:41,256
Then what do you say you and I
break into his restaurant? Tonight?

374
00:30:41,423 --> 00:30:44,051
Yes, that's good,
because I am telling you,

375
00:30:44,134 --> 00:30:48,388
if anybody in this place
has the PX-41 serum,

376
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,640
it's him.

377
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:56,855
All right, all right, homework done,
pajamas on, teeth brushed, time for bed.

378
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,106
What's the big hurry?

379
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,150
I just have a lot of work to do.

380
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,194
Work, what kind of work?

381
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:03,987
Very important business.

382
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:05,864
So, hugs, kisses.

383
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:08,784
Good night, sleep tight, don't
let the bedbugs blah-blah-blah.

384
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:09,910
Whoa!

385
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,370
But you said you'd help me practice

386
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:13,538
my part for the Mother's Day show.

387
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:18,210
Fine, fine.
Let me hear it. Quickly.

388
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:22,089
<i>She kisses my boo-boos,
she braids my hair.</i>

389
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,175
<i>My mother is beyond compare.</i>

390
00:31:25,342 --> 00:31:28,220
<i>We love you, mothers, everywhere.</i>

391
00:31:28,804 --> 00:31:31,640
Wow! That was something else.

392
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:34,768
I really liked the way
you smiled at the end.

393
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,937
Let's try this one more time,

394
00:31:37,104 --> 00:31:42,192
but a teensy bit less
like a zombie, okay?

395
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:43,318
Okay.

396
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:46,446
<i>She kisses my boo-boos,
she braids my hair...</i>

397
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,323
Perfect! Time to go.

398
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:50,951
I don't think I should do this.

399
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,328
Well, what do you mean?
Why not?

400
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:55,122
I don't even have a mom.

401
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,583
Well, you don't need one to do the show.

402
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:01,420
I mean, you did the Veterans Day Pageant

403
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:03,004
and you haven't been in combat.

404
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:05,507
This is different.

405
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:10,637
Okay, well, then maybe you can
just use your imagination.

406
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:13,598
You mean I pretend I have a mom?

407
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:16,476
Yes, right? You can do that, can't you?

408
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,687
Yeah! I do that all the time.

409
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:20,188
Thanks, Gru!

410
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,944
Hey!

411
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:54,055
All right. Hey, hey, no, no! No.

412
00:32:54,181 --> 00:32:56,308
Hey. Hey, please.

413
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:59,561
Kevin, Jerry, watch the girls for me, okay?

414
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:03,064
Dave, Stuart, come this way!
With me! Come on!

415
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:06,985
Come on!

416
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,069
Mmm-mmm!

417
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:39,476
Oh!

418
00:33:41,937 --> 00:33:42,979
Mmm-hmm.

419
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:47,776
Huh?

420
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:55,617
- Oca!
- Oca!

421
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:13,552
Looka too!

422
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:19,891
Huh?

423
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:03,310
We're stealth ninjas.
We make no sound.

424
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,604
Right. Gotcha.

425
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,398
Ya!

426
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:13,028
All right, El Macho.
You're going down.

427
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,155
- Wait! Wait.
- What?

428
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:17,907
What are you doing?

429
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:20,619
I'm checking for laser
beam alarm triggers.

430
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:23,121
It's a restaurant!

431
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,748
You never know what kind of booby traps

432
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:26,416
this guy could have set. Huh? Come on.

433
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,835
There are no booby traps.

434
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,921
Ha! Booby!

435
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:44,559
Oh. There's a chicken.

436
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,936
Are you lost, little guy?

437
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:48,980
You must be lost.

438
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,940
Ha! Some guard dog.

439
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,739
Get it off of me!
Get it off of me!

440
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,574
Aah!

441
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,998
I got you!

442
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,254
I got it!

443
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,223
Ha!

444
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:26,059
Oh!

445
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,984
What is wrong with that chicken?

446
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:39,614
Hey, that <i>pollo es loco.</i>

447
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:41,282
No?

448
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:43,326
Okay, let's go.

449
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,001
Are you getting anything?

450
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:53,628
No, not yet.

451
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:57,507
But, hey, maybe you can find
something with these X-ray goggles.

452
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,510
Bah.

453
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:07,642
How are they working?
Tell me! Tell me!

454
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,102
Aah! Oof!

455
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,770
What's wrong? Is something wrong?

456
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:14,232
That's an image I'll never
get out of my brain. Blech!

457
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,159
I knew it!

458
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,161
The serum is in here!

459
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,495
Ooh, then let's get it.

460
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:32,000
This is going to be good!

461
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,126
Ah.

462
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,631
Ah-ha!

463
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:39,966
What?

464
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:43,178
Salsa?

465
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:44,929
Aw, man.

466
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:47,557
Oh.

467
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:54,564
Somebody's going to die tonight.

468
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:01,821
Pollito!

469
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:04,324
What did they do to you?
Pollito? Can you hear me?

470
00:38:05,575 --> 00:38:08,953
Who would do this to such
a sweet little chicken?

471
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:10,955
What? Who's there?

472
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,665
Mmm-mmm.

473
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:14,709
You coming out?
Or am I gonna go in?

474
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:21,299
Yah!

475
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,468
Huh?

476
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:25,887
Stop!

477
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,056
My eyes!

478
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:31,392
Gru, call one of your munchkins!

479
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,686
We've been spotted!
Come get us!

480
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:35,146
Huh? Hey!

481
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,731
Ah!

482
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,243
Hmm, subtle.

483
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,290
Over here! Over here!

484
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:55,959
Over

485
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,168
here.

486
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,260
Hold tight!

487
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:10,265
Aah!

488
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:18,606
I have you now!

489
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:55,476
Yay! Ice cream!

490
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,062
Huh?

491
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:18,416
Huh?

492
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:54,744
All right, there he is.

493
00:40:54,911 --> 00:40:57,789
Suspect number eight, Floyd Eaglesan.

494
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,499
Oh, okay.

495
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:01,542
See if you can get closer.
Go, go.

496
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:14,097
All right.

497
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:15,348
What the...

498
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:18,685
Oh, no. That's not good.

499
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,521
Whoa!

500
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:23,064
Hey, uh, what?

501
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,067
Oh!

502
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:31,990
Hey, Gru!

503
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:34,534
Oh, girls! What are you doing here?

504
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:36,577
Well, we thought we'd come
visit you at work.

505
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:39,414
So, you're saving the world
in a garbage can?

506
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:42,000
Funny.

507
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:43,918
Hey! There you are.

508
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,420
Oh. Who's this?

509
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:49,590
Lucy, these are my girls,
Margo, Edith and Agnes.

510
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:52,552
Girls, Lucy. Lucy, girls.

511
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,595
- Hello.
- Hi.

512
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,397
Are you single?

513
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:06,607
Oh! Goodness.

514
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:10,737
Oh, hey! I have an idea. Since Lucy
and I have lots of work to do,

515
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:13,489
- why don't you girls go and explore the mall?
- Bye!

516
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:16,784
Here is some money,
go buy some useless mall junk.

517
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,536
Some headbands and...

518
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,121
Are you gonna marry Lucy?

519
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:24,167
Are you out of your gourd?
No! She just works with me.

520
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:25,668
Plus, you love her.

521
00:42:25,752 --> 00:42:28,463
<i>You love her! You love her!
You really, really love her!</i>

522
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:29,797
<i>And you're gonna get married!</i>

523
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:30,965
Okay, stop.
This is a song of lies.

524
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,133
<i>And I will be the flower girl!</i>

525
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:34,260
I don't even like her.
Now, go have fun!

526
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,347
Almost forgot. Hugs!

527
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:39,932
Good luck saving the world.
Bye.

528
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:41,309
Bye, Gru!

529
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:48,941
Kids, right? They're funny.

530
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:50,985
Those girls totally adore you.

531
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:52,820
I bet you're a fun dad.

532
00:42:53,488 --> 00:42:54,572
Huh.

533
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,657
I am pretty fun.

534
00:43:05,625 --> 00:43:07,001
Is that stealing?

535
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:10,004
Not if my wish was that I
would get a lot of free coins.

536
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,283
Whoa!

537
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:42,703
Cool glasses.

538
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:43,955
Oh.

539
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:46,124
I'm Antonio.

540
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:48,209
I'm Margo.

541
00:43:48,376 --> 00:43:51,963
I was just going to get a cookie.
Care to join me?

542
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,006
Uh, sure.

543
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,801
I'm Margo.

544
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:06,978
Um, I'll catch up with you guys later.

545
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:08,396
Bye!

546
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:12,525
Can I be the first to say, "Ew!"

547
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,485
We gotta go tell Gru!

548
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,783
All right, I'm going in.

549
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:23,911
<i>If it picks up any traces of the serum,
the sensor in your belt buckle</i>

550
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:25,371
will make a sound like this...

551
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:26,706
Mee-maw! Mee-maw!

552
00:44:26,831 --> 00:44:27,832
- <i>Mee-maw! Mee-maw!</i>
- Okay!

553
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,667
I get it. I get it.

554
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:39,969
Welcome to Eagle Hair Club.

555
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,638
It's about time you showed up,

556
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:44,098
Mr. Gru.

557
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:47,351
You know my name?

558
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:51,939
When someone moves into the mall
who is folically-challenged,

559
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:55,610
I make it my business
to know all about them.

560
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:58,446
You are bald, and that is bad.

561
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,282
There you go, my sweet.

562
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,242
<i>I'm getting nothing so far.</i>

563
00:45:03,326 --> 00:45:04,952
I think you need to move around.

564
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,421
Wow, this looks interesting.
What is it?

565
00:45:15,588 --> 00:45:17,089
I take it you're an art lover?

566
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:18,299
<i>No serum.</i>

567
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:19,592
Yeah, not so much.

568
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:26,349
Oh, how about this impressive trinket?

569
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:28,267
I'd hardly call it a trinket, Mr. Gru.

570
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:29,852
- <i>Nothing.</i>
- The International...

571
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:31,062
Yeah, I don't care.

572
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:38,236
<i>Mee-maw! Mee-maw!</i>

573
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,738
<i>Hold on, I'm picking up something.
Behind that wall!</i>

574
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,490
Ah, and what do we have here?

575
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:45,826
These are my trial wigs.
You should take one.

576
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:49,163
No, thanks. So, what's on
the other side of the wall?

577
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:50,581
Here you are!
Look at me! Focus!

578
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:51,832
<i>Gru?</i>

579
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:56,420
I promise that this wig will
transform you from ugly

580
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:59,590
to irresistible.

581
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:01,842
Margo has a boyfriend!

582
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:03,928
And they're going on a date!

583
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:05,346
Date? Boyfriend?

584
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:06,681
What?

585
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:20,194
There she goes!

586
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:33,874
Oh, you're so funny.

587
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,126
Gross!

588
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:37,378
- Look, they're in love.
- Oh, no, no, no.

589
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,880
Do not say that. No, no, no.

590
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:44,302
And my dream is to one day
play video games for a living.

591
00:46:44,385 --> 00:46:46,137
Wow.

592
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,264
You're so complicated.

593
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:49,932
Margo.

594
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:51,600
What is going on here?

595
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:56,480
Oh, Gru, <i>Se llama</i> Antonio.
<i>Me llamo</i> Margo.

596
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:59,900
Me llama-lama ding-dong.
Who cares? Let's go.

597
00:47:05,865 --> 00:47:06,907
Whoa!

598
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,391
Kids eat free on Tuesdays.

599
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:43,861
Yay, Pop!

600
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,571
That's awesome!

601
00:47:47,448 --> 00:47:51,118
- So good to see you again, <i>mi compadre</i>!
- Ha! Yeah.

602
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:53,662
Oh, I see you have already met my father.

603
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,915
What? Father?

604
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:59,418
<i>Sí.</i> Look at this crazy
small world we live in, eh?

605
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:01,504
Come, sit, let me get you something.

606
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:05,341
Oh, look at you. Heh?

607
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:09,720
He likes me.

608
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:13,682
Oh, oh! I'm sorry.
Pollito is usually very friendly.

609
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:15,351
He had a rough night.

610
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,607
Well, we really should be going.
Girls, come on.

611
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,484
That is a pity.

612
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:26,278
Young love is beautiful, no?

613
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:27,655
No!

614
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:31,325
You know, they're not in love.
They hardly know each other.

615
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,328
You are right, <i>Cabeza de huevo.</i>

616
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:36,664
They must get to know each other better!

617
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:40,876
Antonio, why don't you invite
your girlfriend and her family

618
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,586
to our <i>Cinco de Mayo</i> party?

619
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:43,712
No, no.

620
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:44,922
<i>Sí!</i>

621
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:02,022
I'm sorry, El Macho?

622
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:04,150
Hadn't we eliminated him as a suspect

623
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:06,277
after the whole salsa incident?

624
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,863
Yes, but there has been
a new development,

625
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:12,032
and I'm telling you, this is the guy.

626
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:14,535
You need to arrest him immediately.

627
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:18,122
And his deviously charming son!

628
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:21,125
I'm pretty sure that the son
is involved, too.

629
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:23,878
The son, also!
You got to get the son!

630
00:49:24,003 --> 00:49:27,548
I think that the son is the mastermind!

631
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:30,176
There's a look, there's a devilish look

632
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:31,802
in his eyes, and I don't like it!

633
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:33,971
Yes, but I don't really see any evidence.

634
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:35,806
Evidence, schmevidence. I go with my gut,

635
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:39,560
and my gut tells me
that this guy is El Macho.

636
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:42,146
Lock him up, lock up the son.

637
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:46,233
Don't forget about the son.
The kid gives me the creeps!

638
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,319
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

639
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:53,407
But, on the less crazy side of things,

640
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:56,702
Gru discovered traces
of the serum at Eagle Hair Club!

641
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:59,038
Hmm, interesting.

642
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:01,332
Yeah! And you know who
made that happen? Huh?

643
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:04,710
This guy. Nailed it.
Amazing, right?

644
00:50:04,793 --> 00:50:08,589
No, I mean, sure. But it's
not him, it is El Macho!

645
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:10,591
Mr. Gru, please!

646
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:13,594
No! It is him, and I will prove it!

647
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:17,264
Gru, come on!

648
00:50:19,892 --> 00:50:22,061
He really thinks it's El Macho.

649
00:50:22,937 --> 00:50:24,271
Can you tell?

650
00:50:48,796 --> 00:50:50,422
Oh. Whoo!

651
00:51:27,543 --> 00:51:28,836
Give me that!

652
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:39,888
Kevin, the Wi-Fi's out!

653
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,765
Kevin?

654
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:44,518
Hey, Lance, where the heck is Kevin?

655
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:50,190
All right, we need to revisit the number
of vacation days you guys get.

656
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:52,651
I can't find anybody anymore.

657
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,446
Gru, it's Jillian!

658
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:58,365
I've got good news!

659
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:00,659
I have my friend Shannon here with me.

660
00:52:00,743 --> 00:52:02,870
I was thinking you two
could get some grub.

661
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:06,373
You know, tear it up, see what happens!

662
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,541
Open up!

663
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,168
<i>La, la, la, la, la, la, la...</i>

664
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:12,171
Agnes! Agnes, tell Jillian I'm not here.

665
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,381
Gru's not here.

666
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:16,216
Are you sure?

667
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:17,801
Yes, he just told me!

668
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:19,928
Mmm-mmm!

669
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:22,473
I mean, no, he didn't just tell me.

670
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:25,684
Agnes, where is Gru?

671
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:28,937
He's putting on lipstick!

672
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,899
He's swatting at flies!

673
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:33,067
No! No!

674
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,652
He's chopping his head off!

675
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:39,114
He's pooping?

676
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,909
I know you're in there, Gru!

677
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:45,454
There's no way you're
getting out of this!

678
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:54,046
I have to tell you, I was
so nervous about tonight.

679
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:57,341
I mean there's just so many
phonies out there!

680
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,844
Yes, I hear you.

681
00:53:01,679 --> 00:53:03,389
Oh, so, do you work out?

682
00:53:03,472 --> 00:53:04,556
Well...

683
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:07,518
I mean, obviously, you don't,
but would you consider it?

684
00:53:07,643 --> 00:53:11,271
Huh? Physical fitness is very
important to Shannon.

685
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:13,148
As you can tell, right? Huh?

686
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:15,401
Ah.

687
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:16,610
I can tell.

688
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:17,861
Solid.

689
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:20,531
We are in the restaurant, you know.

690
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:23,951
Hi. Takeout for Lucy?

691
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:25,577
Sure, just a sec.

692
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:40,843
<i>Your accent is so exotic.</i>

693
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:43,137
Ah. Well, thank you very much.

694
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,888
I know someone who can fix that for you.

695
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:47,808
And you'll be talking normal in no time!

696
00:53:50,144 --> 00:53:52,312
Whoo. Is it hot in here?

697
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:56,024
How's the food?

698
00:53:57,067 --> 00:54:00,779
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Are you wearing a wig?

699
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,030
What?

700
00:54:02,114 --> 00:54:04,074
Ah! I don't think so.

701
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:05,325
I knew it.

702
00:54:05,451 --> 00:54:07,578
You're a phony. I hate phonies!

703
00:54:07,661 --> 00:54:09,872
Oh, what?
No. These locks are all mine.

704
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:11,248
No, they're not!

705
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:14,460
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna rip that thing off your head,

706
00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:17,421
and show everyone what
a bald-headed phony you are.

707
00:54:17,504 --> 00:54:18,714
I don't think so, Miss Lady.

708
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:29,725
Hello?

709
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:31,143
Hello? Are you...

710
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:32,478
Hey, Gru.

711
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:35,689
Hello, Lucy. How are you doing?

712
00:54:35,773 --> 00:54:38,192
Wow, looks like your date's
out for the count.

713
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:41,278
It's like she's been shot
with a mild moose tranquilizer.

714
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:49,995
Yeah, I'm winking because
that's what actually happened.

715
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:53,290
<i>Scusi,</i> what's happening here?
She no like?

716
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:54,833
Oh, she's just, uh...

717
00:54:56,335 --> 00:54:57,461
Oh, ho.

718
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,505
<i>Sì, sì. Sì.</i>

719
00:54:59,588 --> 00:55:01,006
Shall we take her home?

720
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:13,227
Oh!

721
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:46,927
Well, I think you did it. You just
officially had the worst date ever.

722
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:48,595
Huh, tell me about it.

723
00:55:48,971 --> 00:55:52,182
Don't worry. It can only get
better from here, right?

724
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:54,393
But if it doesn't, you can
always borrow my dart gun.

725
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:56,854
I've had to use it on one
or two dates myself.

726
00:55:56,979 --> 00:55:59,189
Yeah, you know, as far as dates go,

727
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:01,608
I think I'm good with just the one.

728
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:08,490
Well, good night, partner.

729
00:56:10,826 --> 00:56:12,077
This was fun.

730
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,997
Yes. Surprisingly, it was.

731
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:17,958
Oh, and, uh, just between you and me?

732
00:56:18,542 --> 00:56:20,419
You look much better bald.

733
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:24,298
See you tomorrow.

734
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:35,058
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack!

735
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:41,773
Yay!

736
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:43,483
So, I take it the date went well?

737
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:45,819
No, it was horrible.

738
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:58,999
High-five!

739
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:01,209
Bump it.

740
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,253
Mr. Ramsbottom?

741
00:57:45,379 --> 00:57:46,588
Oh, hello.

742
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:48,131
What are you doing here?

743
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:50,133
- We got him.
- Got who?

744
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:51,927
Floyd Eaglesan!

745
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:54,972
Our agents located a secret
room in his shop last night

746
00:57:55,055 --> 00:57:56,848
and discovered this.

747
00:57:56,932 --> 00:58:01,061
It's empty, but we found traces
of the PX-41 serum in it.

748
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:02,562
He's our man.

749
00:58:02,688 --> 00:58:07,067
So, somehow, in spite of your
incompetence, we solved this one.

750
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:08,735
I was framed!

751
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:10,404
You won't get away with this!

752
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:13,031
Get your mitts off of me!
I am a legitimate businessman.

753
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:16,868
Ah. All right. So what now?

754
00:58:16,952 --> 00:58:20,038
Well, now you're free to go
back to your business.

755
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,582
Mmm. Jams and jellies.

756
00:58:22,708 --> 00:58:24,668
And it looks like Agent Wilde will be

757
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:26,712
transferring to our Australian branch.

758
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:28,630
Australia?

759
00:58:28,714 --> 00:58:29,923
Yes.

760
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:31,758
But thank you for everything.

761
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:34,678
And by everything,
of course I mean nothing.

762
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:37,347
Toodle pip and cheerio, Mr. Gru.

763
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:44,062
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

764
00:58:44,146 --> 00:58:45,564
So, we got him.

765
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:48,775
Yay. That's great.

766
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,694
And now you're going to Australia?

767
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:53,530
Well, it's not definite yet.
I'm still figuring it out.

768
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:55,741
I've already been working on my accent.

769
00:58:55,824 --> 00:58:57,993
Wallaby. Didgeridoo.

770
00:58:58,118 --> 00:59:00,787
Hugh Jackman.

771
00:59:01,163 --> 00:59:04,750
So, um... Pretty excited.

772
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:07,085
Great.

773
00:59:07,169 --> 00:59:09,463
Well, good luck.

774
00:59:09,588 --> 00:59:12,340
Thanks. You, too.

775
00:59:13,133 --> 00:59:15,802
Oh! Here. I wanted to give you this.

776
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:17,804
Your lipstick taser?

777
00:59:17,888 --> 00:59:19,806
Yeah, it's just a memento.

778
00:59:19,890 --> 00:59:23,977
Just, you know,
from the first time we met.

779
00:59:24,144 --> 00:59:26,313
Oh. Thank you, Lucy.

780
00:59:27,147 --> 00:59:28,648
Agent Wilde.

781
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:32,235
Well, it looks like they need you, so...

782
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:35,113
Yeah, I better go.

783
00:59:36,198 --> 00:59:37,574
Bye, Gru.

784
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:16,029
I brought you an umbrella.

785
01:00:19,908 --> 01:00:20,992
Ah, thank you.

786
01:00:21,076 --> 01:00:22,661
What are you doing out here?

787
01:00:23,245 --> 01:00:27,374
Remember when you said that I liked Lucy?

788
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:31,002
Well, it turns out,

789
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:32,379
you're right.

790
01:00:33,130 --> 01:00:34,214
Really?

791
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:35,757
Yes, but...

792
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:38,885
Well, she's moving away.

793
01:00:38,969 --> 01:00:41,763
I'm never going to see her again.

794
01:00:45,517 --> 01:00:47,602
Is there anything I could do to help?

795
01:00:48,186 --> 01:00:51,940
Aw, I don't...
I don't think so, sweetheart.

796
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:55,569
Well, is there anything you could do?

797
01:00:57,195 --> 01:00:59,823
Hello, Lucy. This is Gru.

798
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:02,993
I know up to this point our relationship

799
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:05,412
has been strictly professional,

800
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:09,791
and you're leaving
for Australia and all, but...

801
01:01:09,958 --> 01:01:13,003
Okay, here is the question.

802
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:14,754
Would you like to...

803
01:01:16,131 --> 01:01:19,426
To go out on a date?

804
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:21,928
Uh, no.

805
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:23,972
Okay, that's not helping.

806
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:27,058
All right, here we go.
For real this time.

807
01:01:36,985 --> 01:01:38,320
I can do this.

808
01:01:57,047 --> 01:01:58,298
Agh! I hate you!

809
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:03,178
Ah.

810
01:02:58,525 --> 01:02:59,567
Eh.

811
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,404
- Kevin?
- Mmm?

812
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:03,780
Tom?

813
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:04,948
Hello!

814
01:03:05,532 --> 01:03:07,284
<i>- Kampai!
- Kampai!</i>

815
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:08,576
Huh? <i>Kampai!</i>

816
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:21,589
Bah!

817
01:03:26,011 --> 01:03:27,012
Oh.

818
01:03:29,014 --> 01:03:32,225
<i>Cinco de May-ya-yo! Cinco de May-ya-yo!</i>

819
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:42,193
Whoa!

820
01:03:42,319 --> 01:03:44,446
This place is awesome!

821
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:49,034
Okay. Let's party, huh?

822
01:03:49,117 --> 01:03:51,828
But first, let's go over the rules.

823
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:55,165
Because what is fun without the rules?

824
01:03:55,332 --> 01:03:56,958
Agnes, easy on the churros.

825
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,377
- Edith, try not to kill anyone.
- <i>Hai!</i>

826
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:00,670
Margo!

827
01:04:00,754 --> 01:04:01,880
Hello, Mr. Gru.

828
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:03,340
Okay.

829
01:04:03,923 --> 01:04:04,966
Gru!

830
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:10,013
There must be the standard 6 feet
of space between you and boys.

831
01:04:10,138 --> 01:04:11,890
Especially this boy.

832
01:04:13,475 --> 01:04:14,976
Ah, you are a funny man.

833
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:17,937
There are no rules, <i>señor</i>.
It's <i>Cinco de Mayo</i>.

834
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:20,315
Come on! They're starting the dance!

835
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:21,941
<i>¡Arriba!</i>

836
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:23,503
So glad you could make it, <i>mi compadre</i>.

837
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:25,422
Hey, what's wrong?

838
01:05:25,505 --> 01:05:27,507
Oh, nothing. Nothing is wrong.

839
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:32,345
I'm just chilling with the guac,
from my chip hat.

840
01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:38,643
Gru, please.
I know that look all too well.

841
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:41,146
It is the look of a broken heart.

842
01:05:41,229 --> 01:05:42,564
How did you know?

843
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:46,151
Believe me, my friend,
I too have spent many nights

844
01:05:46,234 --> 01:05:49,904
trying to drown my sorrows in guacamole.

845
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:52,323
- You?
- Yes.

846
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:56,161
But we are survivors.

847
01:05:56,244 --> 01:06:00,373
There's much more to us
than meets the eye.

848
01:06:00,999 --> 01:06:02,917
Enjoy the party.

849
01:06:56,596 --> 01:06:57,597
Huh.

850
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:20,703
Ah-ha!

851
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:25,083
Ouch!

852
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:43,309
Say what?

853
01:07:56,281 --> 01:07:59,158
Would you like some peanuts or pretzels?

854
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:05,748
That's a good joke.

855
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:12,171
I just did a boom boom.

856
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:15,967
I really need you to make a choice, hon.

857
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:19,012
I choose Gru.

858
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:21,848
I choose Gru!

859
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:27,604
Thank you, Gru stewardess!

860
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:29,355
You're welcome!

861
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:48,708
Aah!

862
01:09:02,764 --> 01:09:06,392
You have not lost your touch, my friend.

863
01:09:06,476 --> 01:09:08,770
Ah-ha! I knew it!

864
01:09:08,895 --> 01:09:10,438
You are El Macho!

865
01:09:10,605 --> 01:09:12,815
That's right!

866
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:14,567
Nobody believed me!

867
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:16,486
Ho-ho! But I knew you weren't dead!

868
01:09:17,737 --> 01:09:21,407
Of course not.
I merely faked my death.

869
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,369
But now, it's time for me

870
01:09:24,452 --> 01:09:28,414
to make a spectacular return to evil.

871
01:09:28,956 --> 01:09:34,337
Doctor, I think it's time we showed
Gru what we're up to here.

872
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,464
Dr. Nefario?

873
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:38,716
Nice to see you, Gru.

874
01:09:39,384 --> 01:09:40,426
Wha...?

875
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:43,513
So, this is your new job opportunity?

876
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:46,557
Absolutely. You're gonna like this.

877
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:52,730
Sorry.

878
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:56,609
I had to borrow some of your minions,
but it was for a worthy cause.

879
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:59,696
Oh! Kevin!

880
01:09:59,779 --> 01:10:02,281
No, he's not Kevin anymore.

881
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:07,370
Now he is an indestructible,
mindless killing machine!

882
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:08,454
Bah!

883
01:10:08,621 --> 01:10:10,540
Just watch this.

884
01:10:24,137 --> 01:10:25,179
Bah!

885
01:10:25,263 --> 01:10:27,140
And here's the best part!

886
01:10:27,265 --> 01:10:30,476
I got an army of them!

887
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:34,647
Look, look, look!

888
01:10:41,696 --> 01:10:42,822
Bah!

889
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:47,076
Soon I will unleash them on the world,

890
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:51,289
and if anyone, anyone
tries to stop them...

891
01:10:51,372 --> 01:10:52,498
Yeow!

892
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:55,168
...their city gets eaten!

893
01:10:55,710 --> 01:10:57,211
We can do it together.

894
01:10:57,336 --> 01:10:58,504
Together?

895
01:10:58,629 --> 01:10:59,672
Together!

896
01:11:00,298 --> 01:11:03,050
I have admired your work
for years, <i>amigo</i>.

897
01:11:03,134 --> 01:11:06,512
Stealing the Moon!
Are you kidding?

898
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:08,931
We would be unstoppable!

899
01:11:09,015 --> 01:11:11,684
Men like you, men like me.

900
01:11:11,768 --> 01:11:15,855
We should be ruling the world!

901
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:17,690
So, are you in?

902
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:19,108
Woo-hoo!

903
01:11:19,859 --> 01:11:21,694
Uh, yeah, probably.

904
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:23,362
Probably?

905
01:11:23,488 --> 01:11:26,115
I mean, yes, yes!
Of course, yes.

906
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:28,993
I just have a lot going on right now.

907
01:11:29,076 --> 01:11:31,829
I just need to get some
things off my plate

908
01:11:31,913 --> 01:11:35,208
before we start taking over
the world, that's all.

909
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:37,210
- Excuse me?
- No, forget it.

910
01:11:37,335 --> 01:11:40,546
One hundred percent! I am in!

911
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:43,758
I think...
Do you hear that? I do.

912
01:11:43,883 --> 01:11:47,553
That's Agnes calling me
from on the surface.

913
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:51,849
Totally in!

914
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:54,894
You know what?

915
01:11:55,019 --> 01:11:57,563
I am not so convinced that he is in.

916
01:12:09,367 --> 01:12:11,369
Edith, Agnes, come on! Ooh!

917
01:12:11,452 --> 01:12:12,537
Oops, sorry.

918
01:12:12,620 --> 01:12:14,288
We need to go home now.
Where is Margo?

919
01:12:14,372 --> 01:12:15,998
But I didn't get a turn!

920
01:12:22,672 --> 01:12:23,756
Margo!

921
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,133
Come on. We're leaving...

922
01:12:26,467 --> 01:12:28,010
Hey, what's wrong?

923
01:12:28,094 --> 01:12:29,679
I hate boys.

924
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:34,892
Yes. They stink.

925
01:12:34,976 --> 01:12:37,186
Uh, sorry. Honey, we got to go.

926
01:13:00,293 --> 01:13:01,794
Oops! Sorry.

927
01:13:06,132 --> 01:13:07,925
Ya!

928
01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:16,267
Hey! Pollito, what's the matter?

929
01:13:16,350 --> 01:13:17,476
Oh, hey, Eduardo!

930
01:13:17,560 --> 01:13:19,395
Lucia, I apologize.

931
01:13:19,478 --> 01:13:22,231
Pollito, he's usually not like this.

932
01:13:22,315 --> 01:13:26,986
The same thing happened
the other day with Gru, and...

933
01:13:28,988 --> 01:13:33,576
Oh, well, speaking of Gru, um, have you
seen him? I really need to talk to him.

934
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:36,829
Yes. I think he's somewhere around here.

935
01:13:36,913 --> 01:13:38,748
You two are close, no?

936
01:13:38,873 --> 01:13:40,499
Oh, I don't know.

937
01:13:40,583 --> 01:13:43,920
I mean, "close,"
I wouldn't say we were close.

938
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:46,005
Why, did he say we were close?
Did he say that?

939
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:48,591
It's more what he didn't say.

940
01:13:48,674 --> 01:13:52,011
For instance, he never mentioned

941
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:55,222
that you were both working
for the Anti-Villain League!

942
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:58,100
You're coming with me.

943
01:13:58,184 --> 01:13:59,226
Hey!

944
01:14:00,519 --> 01:14:01,896
Crikey!

945
01:14:07,944 --> 01:14:10,404
So, Eduardo's actually El Macho?

946
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:11,739
Cool!

947
01:14:11,822 --> 01:14:13,157
No, it is not cool!

948
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:15,618
Plus, I pretty much knew
it was him all along,

949
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:17,703
so if anyone's cool, it's me!

950
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:20,748
<i>Gru!</i>

951
01:14:20,873 --> 01:14:22,917
Well, Dr. Nefario.

952
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:25,795
<i>El Macho's onto you.
He knows you're working for the AVL.</i>

953
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:27,838
<i>And he's got your partner.</i>

954
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:29,715
Lucy?

955
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:33,094
That's impossible.
She's on her way to Australia!

956
01:14:33,177 --> 01:14:34,303
<i>Nefario?</i>

957
01:14:34,387 --> 01:14:35,638
<i>Sorry, gotta go!</i>

958
01:14:37,515 --> 01:14:38,849
He's got Lucy?

959
01:14:39,976 --> 01:14:41,519
Not for long.

960
01:14:41,686 --> 01:14:44,063
Come on, we're getting her out of there.

961
01:16:12,818 --> 01:16:14,028
What was that?

962
01:16:25,873 --> 01:16:27,166
I don't see anything.

963
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:42,181
Run!

964
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:43,891
My unicorn!

965
01:16:44,016 --> 01:16:45,351
Agnes, no!

966
01:17:19,385 --> 01:17:21,137
Come on! Hurry!

967
01:17:24,557 --> 01:17:25,808
What's the matter?

968
01:17:31,564 --> 01:17:32,565
Bah!

969
01:17:43,075 --> 01:17:44,118
<i>Ooh là là.</i>

970
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:48,164
Kevin!

971
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:52,418
Dr. Nefario! You're back!

972
01:17:52,585 --> 01:17:54,253
In the flesh.

973
01:17:55,296 --> 01:17:57,506
Behold, the antidote.

974
01:18:00,926 --> 01:18:04,847
Come on. Let's finally put this
horrible jelly to some good use.

975
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:17,693
Ah! Ah!

976
01:18:20,112 --> 01:18:22,990
Hey, guys, come on!
Stay focused here.

977
01:18:33,834 --> 01:18:34,877
Huh?

978
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,003
Huh?

979
01:18:40,341 --> 01:18:42,051
Uh...

980
01:18:45,846 --> 01:18:47,806
Uh...

981
01:18:48,307 --> 01:18:49,558
Oh.

982
01:19:00,819 --> 01:19:02,029
Uh.

983
01:19:04,990 --> 01:19:07,534
Curses! Foiled again!

984
01:19:07,701 --> 01:19:10,204
These guys captured me!

985
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:43,988
Uh...

986
01:19:44,071 --> 01:19:45,364
No?

987
01:19:47,241 --> 01:19:48,284
Bah!

988
01:19:48,867 --> 01:19:49,994
Run!

989
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:00,462
Up that tree!

990
01:20:01,714 --> 01:20:02,840
Hurry! Hurry!

991
01:21:03,901 --> 01:21:05,694
Hello, Gru!

992
01:21:05,819 --> 01:21:09,114
Hey hey! Nice work, Dr. Nefario!

993
01:21:09,198 --> 01:21:11,367
I put an antidote in the jelly.

994
01:21:11,992 --> 01:21:15,871
I mean, I'm happy to create
an evil army to destroy the world,

995
01:21:15,954 --> 01:21:18,707
but nobody messes with my family.

996
01:21:18,832 --> 01:21:20,834
Thank you, Doctor.

997
01:21:20,959 --> 01:21:22,878
Now, let's go get the...

998
01:21:24,129 --> 01:21:25,297
Hi!

999
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:26,757
You brought the girls?

1000
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:28,175
Yes!

1001
01:21:28,467 --> 01:21:29,510
Oh.

1002
01:21:29,635 --> 01:21:31,053
Was that wrong?

1003
01:21:41,146 --> 01:21:43,607
What's happening to my minions?

1004
01:21:43,690 --> 01:21:44,775
Gru?

1005
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:49,571
You guys, take care
of the rest of the minions.

1006
01:21:49,655 --> 01:21:51,657
I'm going to find Lucy.

1007
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:04,586
Eat jelly, you purple freaks!

1008
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:06,505
Whoa! Whoa!

1009
01:22:33,907 --> 01:22:35,659
It's over, El Macho.

1010
01:22:35,784 --> 01:22:37,077
Now, where is Lucy?

1011
01:22:38,454 --> 01:22:39,746
Let me show you.

1012
01:22:52,384 --> 01:22:53,844
Oh, hey, Gru!

1013
01:22:53,927 --> 01:22:57,431
Turns out you were right about
the whole El Macho thing, huh?

1014
01:22:57,556 --> 01:22:58,891
Yay!

1015
01:22:59,475 --> 01:23:02,978
One push of this button,
and I send that rocket

1016
01:23:03,061 --> 01:23:07,441
straight into the same volcano
where I faked my death.

1017
01:23:07,566 --> 01:23:10,486
Only this time, it's for real.

1018
01:23:10,569 --> 01:23:12,029
No!

1019
01:23:12,112 --> 01:23:13,572
Yah!

1020
01:23:13,697 --> 01:23:15,115
Tallyho!

1021
01:23:21,955 --> 01:23:25,584
We could have ruled
the world together, Gru!

1022
01:23:26,168 --> 01:23:27,544
But now,

1023
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:29,588
you're gonna die.

1024
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:55,656
Oh!

1025
01:24:14,967 --> 01:24:15,968
Ah!

1026
01:24:42,411 --> 01:24:44,746
Mmm, lipstick taser!

1027
01:24:44,871 --> 01:24:47,082
Aw, he copied me.

1028
01:24:53,338 --> 01:24:57,676
I am not afraid of your jelly guns.

1029
01:24:57,801 --> 01:25:01,096
Oh, this ain't a jelly gun, sunshine.

1030
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:10,564
Ho-oh!

1031
01:25:15,235 --> 01:25:17,321
Don't worry about me, Gru, I'll be fine.

1032
01:25:17,404 --> 01:25:19,865
I have survived lots worse than this.

1033
01:25:19,948 --> 01:25:21,366
Okay, that's not entirely true.

1034
01:25:21,450 --> 01:25:23,493
I'm actually kind of
freaking out up here!

1035
01:25:23,577 --> 01:25:25,662
Don't worry, I will get you out of this.

1036
01:25:34,212 --> 01:25:36,381
I really hate that chicken.

1037
01:26:01,281 --> 01:26:03,367
Is there a red one?
It's usually the red one!

1038
01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:08,747
Gru, anytime now!

1039
01:26:10,499 --> 01:26:13,210
Listen, Lucy, we may not
get out of this alive,

1040
01:26:13,293 --> 01:26:15,629
so I need to ask you a question.

1041
01:26:15,712 --> 01:26:16,713
Uh, better make it quick.

1042
01:26:17,255 --> 01:26:20,634
If I had asked you out on a date,
what would you have said?

1043
01:26:21,093 --> 01:26:22,344
Are you kidding me?

1044
01:26:22,427 --> 01:26:23,470
Yes!

1045
01:26:25,472 --> 01:26:26,890
Jump!

1046
01:26:39,528 --> 01:26:40,987
Lucy!

1047
01:26:41,655 --> 01:26:43,907
Lucy, where are you?

1048
01:26:47,119 --> 01:26:48,328
Oh, Lucy!

1049
01:26:49,121 --> 01:26:50,288
Gru!

1050
01:26:54,292 --> 01:26:58,088
Sorry! I guess you need your
arms to tread water, huh?

1051
01:27:06,638 --> 01:27:08,306
They'll be back.

1052
01:27:38,712 --> 01:27:41,506
<i>Underwear...</i>

1053
01:27:49,931 --> 01:27:52,684
<i>Underwear...</i>

1054
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:04,112
<i>Underwear...</i>

1055
01:28:13,538 --> 01:28:14,581
Oh!

1056
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:22,964
Can I be the first to say, "Ew!"

1057
01:28:24,049 --> 01:28:26,551
<i>Underwear...</i>

1058
01:28:42,192 --> 01:28:43,276
Okay.

1059
01:28:44,444 --> 01:28:45,654
Excuse me.

1060
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:49,449
Um, hi, excuse me.

1061
01:28:57,332 --> 01:28:58,416
Uh,

1062
01:28:58,708 --> 01:29:02,462
hi, everybody.
I'd like to make some toast.

1063
01:29:02,587 --> 01:29:03,755
Uh...

1064
01:29:04,798 --> 01:29:06,216
Okay.

1065
01:29:07,509 --> 01:29:08,718
She, um...

1066
01:29:08,802 --> 01:29:13,056
She kisses my boo-boos,
she braids my hair.

1067
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:16,017
We love you, mothers, everywhere.

1068
01:29:16,643 --> 01:29:19,855
And my new mom, Lucy,
is beyond compare.

1069
01:29:19,938 --> 01:29:21,273
Aww.

1070
01:29:21,398 --> 01:29:22,399
Aw.

1071
01:29:29,447 --> 01:29:31,700
To the bride and Gru!

1072
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:53,263
Yeah!

1073
01:30:04,941 --> 01:30:07,444
- Woo-hoo!
- I'm so happy!

1074
01:30:17,537 --> 01:30:18,580
Huh? Ha!

1075
01:30:31,009 --> 01:30:32,010
Bah!

1076
01:30:53,031 --> 01:30:54,950
Hey, Bob! Stuart!

1077
01:31:27,148 --> 01:31:28,316
Eh!

1078
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:29,943
No?

1079
01:31:31,861 --> 01:31:32,904
Ah!

1080
01:31:36,074 --> 01:31:37,158
Bob!

1081
01:31:44,958 --> 01:31:46,001
Uh-oh!

1082
01:32:00,223 --> 01:32:02,142
Okay.

1083
01:32:30,378 --> 01:32:31,421
Okay.

1084
01:32:49,230 --> 01:32:50,273
Aah!

1085
01:33:39,906 --> 01:33:41,658
- Mmm?
- Shh!

1086
01:33:51,626 --> 01:33:53,128
Blah.
