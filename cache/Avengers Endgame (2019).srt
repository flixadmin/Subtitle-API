1
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:09,836
Barton: Okay, hold on,
don't shoot.

2
00:00:10,928 --> 00:00:12,669
-You see where you're going?
-Mm-hmm.

3
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:13,836
Okay.

4
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,925
Now, let's worry
about how you get there.

5
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:18,174
Gotta move your foot here.

6
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:20,097
Point your toe this way.

7
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:22,015
Your hips here.

8
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:23,562
Okay?

9
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,814
-Can you see?
-Yeah.

10
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,982
-Are you sure?
-Mm-hmm.

11
00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:28,400
How about now?
Can you see now?

12
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:29,818
-(Chuckles) No.
-How about now?

13
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:31,270
(Both laugh)

14
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,071
All right.

15
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:35,653
Ready? Three fingers.

16
00:00:36,412 --> 00:00:37,527
Cooper: Nice!

17
00:00:39,123 --> 00:00:40,705
Laura: Nice throw, kiddo.

18
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:41,955
Cooper: Here you go.

19
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:44,450
Hey, you guys want Mayo?
Or mustard?

20
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,001
Or both?

21
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,253
Who puts Mayo on a hot dog?

22
00:00:48,424 --> 00:00:49,459
Probably your brothers.

23
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,632
Uh, two mustard, please!
Thanks, mama.

24
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:52,709
Laura: Got it!

25
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,714
Nate, Mayo or mustard?

26
00:00:55,431 --> 00:00:56,637
How about ketchup?

27
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,014
Laura: Or ketchup.
I got ketchup, too.

28
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,390
Barton: Mind your elbow.

29
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,436
(Laughs) Good job, hawk-eye.

30
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:07,314
Go get your arrow. (Chuckles)

31
00:01:09,445 --> 00:01:10,435
Laura: Hey, guys!

32
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,819
Enough practice.
Soup's on!

33
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,025
Barton: All right.

34
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:15,485
We're coming. We're hungry.

35
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:18,113
Lila, let's go.

36
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:22,405
Lila?

37
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,325
Honey?

38
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,296
Hey, babe?

39
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:42,175
-(Thunder rumbling)
-Babe?

40
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,515
Babe?

41
00:01:46,482 --> 00:01:48,348
(Whistles) Boys!

42
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,100
Boys!

43
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:54,562
Laura!

44
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,731
(Thunder rumbling)

45
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,623
(Psychedelic rock song
playing)

46
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,485
-(Grunts)
-(Object clatters)

47
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,610
You don't need to do that.

48
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,822
Because, uh, you're just
holding the position.

49
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:45,112
-Oh, yeah.
-(Grunts)

50
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,198
-That was close.
-(Grunts)

51
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,951
That's a goal.
We are now one apiece.

52
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,505
I would like to try again.

53
00:02:53,966 --> 00:02:56,207
We're tied up.
Feel the tension?

54
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:57,921
It's fun.

55
00:02:58,095 --> 00:03:00,086
That was terrible.
Now you have a chance to win.

56
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:02,338
And you've won.

57
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,594
Congratulations.

58
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:05,883
Fair game.

59
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,598
Good sport.

60
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:10,983
You have fun?

61
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,729
It was fun.

62
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,502
-(Clicks)
(Grunts)

63
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,955
(Helmet whirring)

64
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,255
(Sighs)

65
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,878
This thing on?

66
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,045
Hey, miss potts. Pep.

67
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:47,099
(Exhales deeply)
If you find this recording...

68
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:50,011
Don't post it on social media.

69
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:51,812
It's gonna be
a real tearjerker.

70
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,894
I Don't know if
you're ever gonna see these.

71
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,105
I Don't even know
if you're still...

72
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,520
Oh, god, I hope So.

73
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,618
Today's day 21.

74
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,037
No, uh, 22.

75
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:08,241
You know, if it wasn't
for the existential terror...

76
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,577
Of staring into
the literal void of space,

77
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:12,874
I'd say I'm feeling
a little better today.

78
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:14,456
Infection's run its course,

79
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:16,082
thanks to
the blue meanie back there.

80
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,255
Oh, you'd love her.

81
00:04:18,425 --> 00:04:19,836
Very practical.

82
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:22,384
Only a tiny bit sadistic.

83
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:29,554
So, the fuel cells
were cracked during battle...

84
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:31,807
And we figured out a way
to reverse the ion charge...

85
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,688
And bought ourselves
about 48 hours of flight time.

86
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,811
Uh, but it's now dead
in the water.

87
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:43,481
Thousand light years
from the nearest 7-Eleven.

88
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:47,371
Oxygen will run out
tomorrow morning...

89
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:50,533
And that'll be it.

90
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,918
Pep, I Know I said
no more surprises...

91
00:04:57,089 --> 00:04:58,796
But I gotta say
I was really hoping

92
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:00,668
to pull off one last one.

93
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,799
But it looks like...

94
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,756
Well, you know
what it looks like.

95
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:08,013
Don't feel bad about this.

96
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:10,971
I mean, actually, if you
grovel for a couple weeks...

97
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,846
And then move on
with enormous guilt...

98
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,978
I should probably lie down
for a minute.

99
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:24,029
Go rest my eyes.

100
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:25,569
(Sighs)

101
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,571
Please know...

102
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:33,372
When I drift off, it'll be
like every night lately.

103
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,541
I'm fine. Totally fine.

104
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:38,498
I dream about you.

105
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,672
Because it's always you.

106
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:47,048
(Clicks, powers off)

107
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,436
(Groaning softly)

108
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,322
(Breathes deeply)

109
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:30,856
(Distant boom)

110
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,327
(Rumbling)

111
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,873
(Tony panting)

112
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:05,409
Couldn't stop him.

113
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:06,577
Neither could I.

114
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:07,916
Hang on.

115
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:11,924
I lost the kid.

116
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,053
Tony, we lost.

117
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:19,340
Is, uh...?

118
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:21,968
-Oh, good.
-Oh, my god!

119
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:24,640
Oh, my god! (Sobbing)

120
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,151
It's okay.

121
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,867
Rhodes: It's been 23 days
since thanos came to earth.

122
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:44,661
Natasha: World governments
are in pieces.

123
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,621
The parts
that are still working...

124
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:50,621
...are trying to take a census
and it looks like he did...

125
00:09:53,385 --> 00:09:54,967
He did exactly what he said
he was gonna do.

126
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,217
Thanos wiped out...

127
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:01,806
...50% of
all living creatures.

128
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:08,058
Where is he now? Where?

129
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:09,940
We don't know.

130
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,193
He just opened a portal
and walked through.

131
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:15,358
(Sighs)

132
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:16,859
What's wrong with him?

133
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,908
Rocket: Oh, he's pissed.

134
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:21,409
He thinks he failed.

135
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:23,953
Which, of course, he did...

136
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,156
But there's a lot of that
going around, ain't there?

137
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:27,745
Honestly,
until this exact second

138
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:28,951
I thought you were
a build-a-bear.

139
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,540
Maybe I am.

140
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,086
We've been hunting thanos
for three weeks now.

141
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,164
Deep space scans...

142
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:36,383
And satellites,
and we got nothing.

143
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,169
Tony, you fought him.

144
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:40,254
Who told you that?

145
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:41,967
I didn't fight him.

146
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,803
No, he wiped my face
with a planet...

147
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,054
While the bleecker street
magician

148
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,385
gave away the store.

149
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,469
That's what happened.

150
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:48,895
There was no fight,
"cause he's not beatable.

151
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:51,690
Did he give you any clues,
any coordinates, anything?

152
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:53,187
Uh... (Sputters)

153
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,186
I saw this coming
a few years back.

154
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,980
I had a vision.
I didn't wanna believe it.

155
00:10:58,491 --> 00:10:59,947
Thought I was dreaming.

156
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:01,108
Tony, I'm gonna need you
to focus.

157
00:11:01,286 --> 00:11:03,027
And I needed you.

158
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,239
As in, past tense.

159
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,657
That trumps what you need.
It's too late, buddy.

160
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:08,949
Sorry.

161
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,627
(Sniffs) You know what I need?
I need a shave.

162
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:15,710
And I believe I remember
telling all youse...

163
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,915
Tony, Tony!

164
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,378
...alive and otherwise,
that what we needed

165
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:22,338
was a suit of armor
around the world.

166
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,422
Remember that?

167
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:26,178
Whether it impacted
our precious freedoms or not.

168
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,475
That's what we needed.

169
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:28,726
Well, that didn't work out,
did it?

170
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,308
I said we'd lose.

171
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,644
You said,
"we'll do that together, too."

172
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,274
And guess what, cap?

173
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:35,730
We lost.

174
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,186
And you weren't there.

175
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:39,943
But that's what we do, right?

176
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,949
Our best work after the fact?
We're the "avengers."

177
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:45,073
We're the "avengers,"
not the "pre-vengers."

178
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:46,153
-Okay.
-Right?

179
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,499
You made your point.
Just sit down, okay?

180
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:48,743
Okay. No, no, here's my point.
You know what?

181
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,289
-She's great by the way.
-Tony, you're sick. Sit down.

182
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,084
Tony: We need you.
You're new blood.

183
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,083
Bunch of tired old mules.
I got nothing for you, cap.

184
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:56,459
I got no coordinates...

185
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:59,375
No clues, no strategies,
no options.

186
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,259
Zero. Zip. Nada.

187
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,170
No trust, liar.

188
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,178
(Tony breathing shakily)

189
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:08,967
Here, take this.

190
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,261
You find him,
you put that on...

191
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:13,267
You hide.

192
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,274
-Steve: Tony!
-I'm fine.

193
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,151
Let me...

194
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:25,947
Rhodes: Bruce gave him
a sedative.

195
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:27,828
He's gonna probably be out
for the rest of the day.

196
00:12:28,915 --> 00:12:30,371
Carol: You guys
take care of him...

197
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:32,078
And I'll bring him a xorrian
elixir when I come back.

198
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:33,659
Where are you going?

199
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:35,498
To kill thanos.

200
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,756
Natasha: Hey.

201
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,959
You know, we usually work
as a team here...

202
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:43,798
And, uh, between you and I,
morale's a little fragile.

203
00:12:43,972 --> 00:12:46,384
We realize up there
is more your territory,

204
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,555
but this is our fight, too.

205
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:48,886
You even know where he is?

206
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,221
I Know people who might.

207
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:51,726
Nebula: Don't bother.

208
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,430
I can tell you
where thanos is.

209
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,943
Thanos spent a long time
trying to perfect me.

210
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:04,611
And when he worked, he talked
about his great plan.

211
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,867
Even disassembled,
I wanted to please him.

212
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:09,448
I'd ask...

213
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,660
Where would we go
once his plan was complete?

214
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:15,159
And his answer
was always the same.

215
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,372
"To the garden."

216
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,758
That's cute.
Thanos has a retirement plan.

217
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:25,464
So, where is he?

218
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,891
When thanos snapped
his fingers...

219
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,048
Earth became ground zero
for a power surge

220
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,929
of ridiculously
cosmic proportions.

221
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,310
No one's ever seen
anything like it.

222
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:35,812
Until two days ago...

223
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,232
On this planet.

224
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,446
Thanos is there.

225
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,863
He used the stones again.

226
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:46,857
Banner: Hey, hey, hey.
(Chuckles)

227
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,908
We'd be going in shorthanded,
you know?

228
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,534
Rhodes: Look, he's still
got the stones, So...

229
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:52,158
So, let's get 'em.

230
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:53,788
Use them
to bring everyone back.

231
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,036
Banner: Just like that?

232
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:56,708
Yeah. Just like that.

233
00:13:56,878 --> 00:14:00,041
Even if there's a small chance
that we can undo this...

234
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:02,923
I mean, we owe it to everyone
who's not in this room to try.

235
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,708
If we do this, how do we know

236
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:07,055
it's gonna end any differently
than it did before?

237
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:08,838
Because before
you didn't have me.

238
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:10,885
Hey, new girl?

239
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:13,767
Everybody in this room
is about that superhero life.

240
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,552
And if you don't mind
my asking,

241
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:16,762
where the hell have you been
all this time?

242
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,143
There are a lot of
other planets in the universe.

243
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:22,184
And unfortunately,
they didn't have you guys.

244
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,533
(Rumbling)

245
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,921
I like this one.

246
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,929
Let's go get
this son of a bitch.

247
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:13,694
Okay.

248
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:16,489
Who here hasn't been to space?

249
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,081
-Why?
-(Carol chuckles)

250
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,829
You better not throw up
on my ship.

251
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:22,290
Approaching jump in three...

252
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,546
Two, one.

253
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,811
(Over speakers)
I'll head down for recon.

254
00:15:58,333 --> 00:15:59,539
This is gonna work, Steve.

255
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,499
I Know it will.

256
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,627
"Cause I Don't know what
I'm gonna do if it doesn't.

257
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:11,710
No satellites.
No ships. No armies.

258
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:13,378
No ground defenses
of any kind.

259
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,136
It's just him.

260
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:19,510
And that's enough.

261
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,310
(Birds chirping)

262
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,642
(Pot clanking)

263
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:16,817
(Grunts)

264
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:22,989
(Choking)

265
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,616
(Grunting)

266
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,885
(Screaming)

267
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,680
(Thanos groaning)

268
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:49,774
Oh, no.

269
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:58,866
(Groans)

270
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:00,993
Where are they?

271
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,988
-(Groaning)
-Answer the question.

272
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,872
The universe
required correction.

273
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:11,834
After that, the stones
served no purpose...

274
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,624
Beyond temptation.

275
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,758
You murdered trillions!

276
00:18:16,721 --> 00:18:19,008
-You should be grateful.
-(Banner grunts)

277
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,429
Where are the stones?

278
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:25,969
Gone.

279
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:27,228
Reduced to atoms.

280
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:29,389
You used them two days ago!

281
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:32,776
I used the stones
to destroy the stones.

282
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,145
It nearly killed me.

283
00:18:36,574 --> 00:18:38,315
But the work is done.

284
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:41,405
It always will be.

285
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:46,365
I am inevitable.

286
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,047
We have to tear this place
apart. He has to be lying!

287
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:52,420
Nebula: My father
is many things.

288
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:55,381
A liar is not one of them.

289
00:18:57,428 --> 00:18:58,589
Ah.

290
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:00,719
Thank you, daughter.

291
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:05,512
Perhaps I treated you
too harshly.

292
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:06,843
(Grunts)

293
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,016
Banner: What?

294
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,435
What did you do?

295
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,775
I went for the head.

296
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,849
Man: So...

297
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,648
..., uh, went on a date
the other day.

298
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:37,479
It's the first time
in five years.

299
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,985
You know?
I'm sitting there at dinner.

300
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:43,189
I didn't even know
what to talk about.

301
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:45,741
What did you talk about?

302
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,579
Eh, same old crap. You know,
how things have changed.

303
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,823
My job, his job.

304
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:54,701
<i>How much we miss the nets.</i>

305
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:58,667
And then things got quiet...

306
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:04,378
Then he cried as they were
serving the salads.

307
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:06,057
What about you?

308
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:10,384
I cried just before dessert.

309
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:16,264
But I'm seeing him
again tomorrow, So...

310
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:18,183
That's great.

311
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:20,022
You did the hardest part.
You took the jump.

312
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,228
You didn't know where you
were gonna come down.

313
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:24,731
And that's it.
That's those little

314
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,157
brave baby steps
we gotta take...

315
00:21:27,328 --> 00:21:31,037
To try and become whole again,
try and find purpose.

316
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,411
I went in the ice in '45,

317
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:36,869
right after I met
the love of my life.

318
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:39,496
Woke up 70 years later.

319
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:44,672
You gotta move on.

320
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,006
Gotta move on.

321
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,266
The world is in our hands.

322
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,522
It's left to us, guys.

323
00:21:58,693 --> 00:22:00,900
And we gotta do
something with it.

324
00:22:01,612 --> 00:22:03,023
Otherwise...

325
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,655
Thanos should've killed
all of us.

326
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:31,388
(Rat squeaking)

327
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,936
(Beeps)

328
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,902
(Beeping)

329
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:46,900
(Powering up)

330
00:22:53,998 --> 00:22:55,284
(Groans)

331
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:03,496
(Blows)

332
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:09,927
What the hell?

333
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,389
(Electricity crackling)

334
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,308
(Powers down)

335
00:23:22,193 --> 00:23:23,558
Hope?

336
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:34,820
(Inaudible)

337
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:57,759
Kid!

338
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:58,972
Hey, kid!

339
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:05,524
What the hell happened here?

340
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:19,197
(Bird cawing)

341
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,970
Oh, my god!

342
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,270
Oh, please!

343
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,976
Please, please!

344
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:47,142
No, no, no. No.

345
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:49,989
No.

346
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,314
Excuse me. Sorry.

347
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,778
Oh, Cassie, no.

348
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,408
No, no, no.

349
00:24:57,788 --> 00:24:59,495
No, no.

350
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,329
Please, please, please.
No, Cassie.

351
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:11,712
What?

352
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,821
(Gasping)

353
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,121
Cassie?

354
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:45,658
Dad?

355
00:25:48,714 --> 00:25:50,500
(Cassie sobbing)

356
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,055
(Sobs)

357
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:14,107
-You're So big!
-(Both laugh)

358
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,705
Rocket: (On speakers)
Yeah. We boarded

359
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:31,914
that highly-suspect warship
Danvers pinged.

360
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:33,798
It was an infectious
garbage scow.

361
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:35,424
So, thanks for the hot tip.

362
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:36,925
Well, you were closer.

363
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,461
Rocket: Yeah. And now
we smell like garbage.

364
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:39,886
You get a reading
on those tremors?

365
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:42,640
'Twas a mild subduction
under the African plate.

366
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,847
Do we have a visual?
How are we handling it?

367
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,181
Okoye: Nat.

368
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:48,604
It's an earthquake
under the ocean.

369
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:51,607
We handle it
by not handling it.

370
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:54,477
Carol, are we seeing you here
next month?

371
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,028
Not likely.

372
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:57,651
What? You gonna get
another haircut?

373
00:26:57,825 --> 00:26:59,156
Listen, fur face.

374
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,112
I'm covering
a lot of territory.

375
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:03,073
The things
that are happening on earth

376
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:04,415
are happening everywhere.

377
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:06,580
On thousands of planets.

378
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,252
All right, all right.
That's a good point.

379
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,416
That's a good point.

380
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,668
So, you might not see me
for a long time.

381
00:27:12,506 --> 00:27:14,167
All right. Uh, Well...

382
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,166
This channel's always active.

383
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,426
So, if anything
goes sideways...

384
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:22,008
Anyone's making trouble
where they shouldn't...

385
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,343
Comes through me.

386
00:27:23,434 --> 00:27:25,050
-(Assents in xhosa)
-Okay.

387
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:26,600
All right.

388
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:28,435
Good luck.

389
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:34,608
(Sighs softly)

390
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:38,021
Where are you?

391
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,188
Rhodes: Mexico.

392
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,983
The federales found a room
full of bodies.

393
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:43,777
Looks like
a bunch of cartel guys...

394
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:45,911
Never even had a chance
to get their guns off.

395
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,788
It's probably a rival gang.

396
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:49,164
Except it isn't.

397
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:51,500
It's definitely barton.

398
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:53,669
What he's done here...

399
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:57,002
What he's been doing
for the last few years...

400
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:59,629
I mean,
the scene that he left...

401
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:01,627
I gotta tell you,

402
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:04,180
there's a part of me that
doesn't even wanna find him.

403
00:28:09,772 --> 00:28:12,013
Will you find out
where he's going next?

404
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,070
Nat?

405
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:20,571
Please?

406
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:23,487
Okay.

407
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:30,365
(Breathes shakily)

408
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:34,126
Steve: You know, I'd offer
to cook you dinner...

409
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:36,045
But you seem
pretty miserable already.

410
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,546
Natasha: You here
to do your laundry?

411
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,302
And to see a friend.

412
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:47,052
Clearly, your friend is fine.

413
00:28:49,812 --> 00:28:51,098
You know,
I saw a pod of whales

414
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:52,303
when I was coming over
the bridge.

415
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,313
-In the Hudson?
-There's fewer ships...

416
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:55,723
Cleaner water.

417
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,767
You know,
if you're about to tell me

418
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,818
to look on the bright side...

419
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,236
Um...

420
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:03,564
I'm about to hit you
in the head

421
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,775
with a peanut butter sandwich.

422
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:06,859
Hmm.

423
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:08,907
Sorry.

424
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,242
Force of habit.

425
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:25,924
You know,
I keep telling everybody

426
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,630
they should move on...

427
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:29,465
And grow.

428
00:29:30,686 --> 00:29:31,972
Some do.

429
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:36,931
But not us.

430
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:39,729
If I move on, who does this?

431
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:42,228
Maybe it doesn't need
to be done.

432
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:48,693
I used to have nothing.

433
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:51,783
And then I got this.

434
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,791
This job.

435
00:29:58,172 --> 00:29:59,913
This family.

436
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:07,587
And I was better
because of it.

437
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:17,392
And even though
they're gone...

438
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,773
I'm still trying to be better.

439
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,237
I think we both need
to get a life.

440
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,074
You first.

441
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,370
(Device chimes)

442
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,785
Scott: (On speakers)
Oh, hi, <i>hi!</i>

443
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,086
Uh, is anyone home?

444
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,963
This is, uh, Scott lang.

445
00:30:43,133 --> 00:30:45,966
We met a few years ago
at the airport...

446
00:30:46,136 --> 00:30:47,797
In Germany?

447
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,258
I was the guy that got
really big. I had a mask on.

448
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:52,014
-You wouldn't recognize me.
-Is this an old message?

449
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,058
Scott: Ant-man?
I Know you know that.

450
00:30:55,229 --> 00:30:56,310
It's the front gate.

451
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:57,807
Scott: I really need
to talk to you guys.

452
00:30:57,898 --> 00:31:00,060
(Muttering to himself)

453
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:05,148
Steve: Scott.

454
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,104
Are you okay?

455
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,272
Yeah.

456
00:31:10,077 --> 00:31:12,444
Have either of you guys
ever studied quantum physics?

457
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,373
Only to make conversation.

458
00:31:15,457 --> 00:31:17,073
All right, So...

459
00:31:17,459 --> 00:31:20,167
Five years ago,
right before...

460
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:21,869
Thanos...

461
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:24,338
I was in a place
called the quantum realm.

462
00:31:24,508 --> 00:31:27,000
The quantum realm is like
its own microscopic universe.

463
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,293
To get in there, you have
to be incredibly small.

464
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:31,007
Hope. She's my, um...

465
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,807
She was my...

466
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,726
She was supposed to
pull me out.

467
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,478
And then thanos happened...

468
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:41,309
And I got stuck in there.

469
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:43,732
I'm sorry, that must have been
a very long five years.

470
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,233
Yeah, but that's just it.

471
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:46,565
It wasn't.

472
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:47,944
For me, it was five hours.

473
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:49,446
See, the rules of
the quantum realm

474
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:50,614
aren't like they are up here.

475
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:52,237
Everything is unpredictable.

476
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:53,617
Is that anybody's sandwich?

477
00:31:53,787 --> 00:31:55,027
I'm starving.

478
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:56,487
Scott.

479
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:57,951
What are you talking about?

480
00:31:58,959 --> 00:32:00,199
(Muffled) So...

481
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,751
What I'm saying is...

482
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,042
Time works differently
in the quantum realm.

483
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:08,082
The only problem is right now

484
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,587
we don't have a way
to navigate it.

485
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:10,668
But what if we did?

486
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,636
I can't stop thinking
about it.

487
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:14,714
What if we could
somehow control the chaos...

488
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:16,014
And we could navigate it?

489
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:17,683
What if there was a way...

490
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,385
That we could enter
the quantum realm

491
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,560
at a certain point in time...

492
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:22,187
But then exit
the quantum realm

493
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:23,435
at another point in time?

494
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:24,940
Like...

495
00:32:25,694 --> 00:32:27,776
-Like before thanos.
-Steve: Wait.

496
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,528
Are you talking
about a time machine?

497
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:32,440
No. No, of course not.
No, not a time machine.

498
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:33,653
This is more like a...

499
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:37,612
Yeah. Like a time machine.

500
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,575
I Know, it's crazy.
It's crazy.

501
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,782
(Stammers) But I can't stop
thinking about it.

502
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:43,117
There's gotta be...

503
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:45,244
Some way... (Sighs)

504
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:47,125
-It's crazy.
-Natasha: Scott.

505
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:48,585
I get emails from a raccoon...

506
00:32:48,759 --> 00:32:50,750
So nothing
sounds crazy anymore.

507
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,593
So, who do we talk to
about this?

508
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:12,946
Chow time!

509
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,445
Maguna.

510
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:22,114
Morgan h. Stark,
you want some lunch?

511
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:24,158
Define "lunch”

512
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,504
-or be disintegrated.
-Okay.

513
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,382
You should not be
wearing that, okay?

514
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:29,872
That is part of
a special anniversary gift

515
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,047
I'm making for mom.

516
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:37,388
There you go.
You thinking about lunch?

517
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:39,468
I can give you a handful of
crickets on a bed of lettuce.

518
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:41,350
-No.
-That's what you want.

519
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,636
How did you find this?

520
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:45,646
-Garage.
-Really?

521
00:33:45,816 --> 00:33:47,807
-Were you looking for it?
-No.

522
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:50,560
- I found it, though.
-Hmm.

523
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,478
You like
going in the garage, huh?

524
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:54,567
So does daddy. (Grunts)

525
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:57,491
It's fine, actually. Mom never
wears anything I buy her.

526
00:34:00,205 --> 00:34:01,445
So, I'm gonna...

527
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:21,511
(Stammers) No.
We know what it sounds like.

528
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:22,636
Tony, after everything
you've seen,

529
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:23,718
is anything really impossible?

530
00:34:23,812 --> 00:34:26,019
Quantum fluctuation messes
with the planck scale...

531
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,850
Which then triggers
the deutsch proposition.

532
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:28,976
Can we agree on that?

533
00:34:29,151 --> 00:34:30,232
Thank you.

534
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,518
In layman's terms, it means
you're not coming home.

535
00:34:32,863 --> 00:34:34,103
- I did.
-No.

536
00:34:34,281 --> 00:34:36,147
You accidentally survived.
(Sighs)

537
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,403
It's a billion-to-one
cosmic fluke.

538
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:41,660
And now you wanna pull a...
What do you call it?

539
00:34:43,707 --> 00:34:45,038
A time heist?

540
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,324
Yeah, a time heist. Of course.

541
00:34:47,419 --> 00:34:48,625
Why didn't we think
of this before?

542
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:51,249
Oh, because it's laughable.
Because it's a pipe dream.

543
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,501
The stones are in the past.

544
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:54,923
We could go back,
we could get them.

545
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,380
We can snap our own fingers.
We can bring everybody back.

546
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,465
Or screw it up worse than
he already has, right?

547
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:00,629
I Don't believe we would.

548
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,761
Gotta say it. I sometimes miss
that giddy optimism.

549
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,351
However, high hopes
won't help...

550
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,478
If there's no logical,
tangible way

551
00:35:08,565 --> 00:35:12,024
for me to safely execute
said time heist.

552
00:35:12,194 --> 00:35:14,060
I believe
the most likely outcome

553
00:35:14,154 --> 00:35:15,144
will be our collective demise.

554
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:18,071
Not if we strictly follow
the rules of time travel.

555
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:20,903
All right? It means no talking
to our past selves...

556
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:22,530
No betting on sporting events.

557
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:24,445
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Scott.

558
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,750
Are you seriously telling me

559
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,619
that your plan
to save the universe...

560
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:30,455
Is based on
back to the future?

561
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:33,329
-Is it?
-No.

562
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:34,542
Good. You had me
worried there.

563
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:35,668
"Cause that would be
horseshit.

564
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:38,129
That's not how
quantum physics works.

565
00:35:38,303 --> 00:35:39,464
Tony.

566
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:42,887
We have to take a stand.

567
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,424
We did stand.
And yet, here we are.

568
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:49,057
Scott: I Know you got
a lot on the line.

569
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:52,101
You got a wife, a daughter.

570
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,767
But I lost someone
very important to me.

571
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:56,527
A lotta people did.

572
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:59,688
And now, now we have a chance
to bring her back...

573
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,027
To bring everyone back,

574
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,619
and you're telling me
that you won't even...

575
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,488
That's right, Scott.
I won't even.

576
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:07,537
-I can't.
-(Door closes)

577
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:08,955
(Footsteps approaching)

578
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:12,041
Morgan stark: Mommy told me
to come and save you.

579
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,540
Good job. I'm saved.

580
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,335
I wish you were coming here
to ask me something else.

581
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:18,551
Anything else.

582
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:20,421
I'm honestly happy
to see you guys, I just...

583
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:21,877
Oh, look,
the table's set for six.

584
00:36:21,972 --> 00:36:23,462
Tony. I get it.

585
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,927
And I'm happy for you.
I really am.

586
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,228
But this is a second chance.

587
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:31,349
I got my second chance
right here, cap.

588
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:33,059
Can't roll the dice on it.

589
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:37,062
If you don't talk shop,
you can stay for lunch.

590
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,529
Well, he's scared.

591
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,315
Steve: He's not wrong.

592
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:45,492
Scott: Yeah, but, I mean,
what are we gonna do?

593
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:46,865
We need him.
What, are we gonna stop?

594
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:49,780
No, I wanna do it right.

595
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:54,664
We're gonna need
a really big brain.

596
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:56,916
Bigger than his?

597
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,214
Come on, I feel like
I'm the only one eating here.

598
00:36:59,301 --> 00:37:00,336
Try some of that.

599
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:01,417
Have some eggs.

600
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,259
I'm So confused.

601
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,087
These are confusing times.
(Chuckles)

602
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,092
Right, no, no.
That's not what I meant.

603
00:37:07,267 --> 00:37:09,759
Nah, I get it. I'm kidding!

604
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,139
I Know, it's crazy.

605
00:37:12,314 --> 00:37:13,520
I'm wearing shirts now.

606
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:16,523
Yeah. What? How? Why?

607
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:19,317
Five years ago,
we got our asses beat.

608
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:21,562
Except it was worse for me...

609
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,946
"Cause I lost twice.

610
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:24,902
First, hulk lost,
then banner lost...

611
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,116
And then, we all lost.

612
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,455
No one blamed you, Bruce.

613
00:37:28,622 --> 00:37:29,987
I did.

614
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:32,990
For years,
I've been treating the hulk

615
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,199
like he's
some kind of disease...

616
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:35,750
Something to get rid of.

617
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:39,166
But then, I start looking
at him as the cure.

618
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,874
Eighteen months
in the gamma lab.

619
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:44,635
I put the brains
and the brawn together...

620
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,056
And now, look at me.

621
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,429
Best of both worlds.

622
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,515
-Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
-Yes.

623
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:52,016
Can we get a photo?

624
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:54,428
100%, little person.

625
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,643
Come on, step on up.
Do you mind?

626
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:59,100
-Oh, yeah, yeah.
-Smart hulk: Thanks.

627
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:00,776
Say "green."

628
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:03,187
-Fans: Green.
-Green.

629
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,271
Did you get that?

630
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:05,689
That's a good one.

631
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:08,734
Did you want to grab one
with me? I'm ant-man.

632
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,326
They're hulk fans.
They don't know ant-man.

633
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,578
-Nobody does.
-No, he wants you to take

634
00:38:15,669 --> 00:38:17,376
-a picture with him.
- I Don't want a picture.

635
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:18,543
Boy 1: Stranger danger.

636
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,166
Yeah, look, he's even
saying no, he doesn't.

637
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,246
I get it.
I Don't want it, either.

638
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:22,456
But come on. The kid...

639
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,961
I Don't want a picture
with them.

640
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,125
-He's gonna feel bad.
-Sorry.

641
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,551
They're happy to do it.
They said they'll do it.

642
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:28,174
Scott: I Don't want to do it.
Boy 2: We can do it.

643
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:30,301
-Smart hulk: No, you feel bad.
-Take the goddamn phone.

644
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:31,598
Smart hulk: Okay.

645
00:38:31,685 --> 00:38:32,675
Girl: Thank you, Mr. Hulk.

646
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:34,430
Smart hulk: No, it was great,
kids. Thank you very much.

647
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:36,261
All: Hulk out!

648
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,474
Steve: Bruce.

649
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:38,889
Dab.

650
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:40,850
-Bruce.
-Listen to your mom.

651
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:42,226
She knows better.

652
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:44,065
About what we were saying.

653
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:45,445
Right.

654
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:50,071
The whole time travel do-over?

655
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:55,114
Eh, guys, it's outside of
my area of expertise.

656
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:56,835
Well, you pulled this off.

657
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:01,666
I remember a time when that
seemed pretty impossible, too.

658
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:36,492
I've got a mild inspiration.

659
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:37,869
I'd like to see
if it checks out.

660
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:40,041
So, I'd like to run
one last sim

661
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:41,710
before we pack it in
for the night.

662
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,872
This time, in the shape
of a mobius strip,

663
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,331
inverted, please.

664
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:47,507
Friday:: Processing.

665
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:53,464
Right, give me the eigenvalue
of that particle...

666
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,632
Factoring in spectral decomp.

667
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,767
-That'll take a second.
-Friday: Just a moment.

668
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:01,680
And don't worry if it doesn't
pan out. I'm just kinda...

669
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,690
Model rendered.

670
00:40:04,778 --> 00:40:05,813
(Puffs)

671
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:13,279
(Exhales sharply)

672
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:17,529
Shit!

673
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:19,114
Morgan stark: Shit!

674
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:24,878
(Whispers) What are you
doing up, little miss?

675
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:26,755
-Shit.
-Nope. We don't say that.

676
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,131
Only mommy says that word.

677
00:40:28,301 --> 00:40:29,712
She coined it.
It belongs to her.

678
00:40:29,886 --> 00:40:30,876
Why are you up?

679
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:32,377
"Cause I've got some
important shit going on here!

680
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:33,716
Why do you think?

681
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,426
No, I got something
on my mind.

682
00:40:35,517 --> 00:40:36,848
I got something on my mind.

683
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:38,554
Was it juice pops?

684
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:41,311
Sure was.

685
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:44,473
That's extortion.
That's a word.

686
00:40:44,651 --> 00:40:45,812
What kind you want?

687
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:46,975
Great minds think alike.

688
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,985
Juice pops exactly...

689
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:52,272
Was on my mind.

690
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:54,827
You done? Yeah?

691
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,576
Now you are.

692
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:58,324
Here. Wipe.

693
00:41:01,042 --> 00:41:03,704
Good. That face goes there.

694
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,130
Tell me a story.

695
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,878
A story.

696
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:09,164
Once upon a time,
maguna went to bed. The end.

697
00:41:09,551 --> 00:41:10,916
That is a horrible story.

698
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:12,835
Come on,
that's your favorite story.

699
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:14,716
Love you tons.

700
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:18,556
I love you 3,000.

701
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:20,801
Wow.

702
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:31,020
(Whispers) 3,000.
That's crazy.

703
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,026
Go to bed
or I'll sell all your toys.

704
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:36,574
-Night night.
-(Door closes)

705
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:37,950
Not that it's a competition...

706
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,365
But she loves me 3,000.

707
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,621
Does she, now?

708
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:44,829
You were somewhere in
the low 6 to 900 range.

709
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:45,954
(Chuckles)

710
00:41:50,884 --> 00:41:52,374
Whatcha reading?

711
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,467
Just a book on composting.

712
00:41:54,637 --> 00:41:56,719
What's new with composting?

713
00:41:58,183 --> 00:42:00,220
-Interesting science...
-I figured it out.

714
00:42:01,311 --> 00:42:02,301
By the way.

715
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:04,349
And, you know,

716
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:06,555
just So we're talking
about the same thing...

717
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:08,189
Time travel.

718
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:09,683
What?

719
00:42:13,907 --> 00:42:14,897
Wow.

720
00:42:18,995 --> 00:42:20,531
That's amazing...

721
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,623
And terrifying.

722
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:24,246
That's right.

723
00:42:28,463 --> 00:42:29,669
(Pepper sighs)

724
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,256
We got really lucky.

725
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:34,416
Yeah.

726
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:35,709
I Know.

727
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,002
A lot of people didn't.

728
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,796
Nope. And I can't
help everybody.

729
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:41,889
Sorta seems like you can.

730
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,676
Not if I stop.

731
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:47,721
I can put a pin in it
right now and stop.

732
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:49,514
Tony...

733
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:51,771
Trying to get you to stop...

734
00:42:51,945 --> 00:42:54,562
Has been one of the few
failures of my entire life.

735
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:00,529
Something tells me...

736
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:02,910
I should put it in a lockbox

737
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,499
and drop it
to the bottom of the lake...

738
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:06,914
And go to bed.

739
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,336
But would you be able to rest?

740
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:23,390
Smart hulk: Okay, here we go.
Time travel test number one.

741
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:25,721
Scott, fire up...

742
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:27,807
The, uh, Van thing.

743
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,143
Steve: Breakers are set.

744
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:33,149
Emergency generators
are on standby.

745
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,026
Good, because
if we blow the grid,

746
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:38,322
I Don't want to lose, uh,
tiny here in the 1950s.

747
00:43:38,408 --> 00:43:41,366
-Excuse me?
-He's kidding.

748
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:43,402
You can't say things
like that.

749
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:45,157
(Stammers)
It was a bad joke.

750
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,156
You were kidding, right?

751
00:43:48,293 --> 00:43:51,411
I have no idea. We're talking
about time travel here.

752
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,840
Either it's all a joke,
or none of it is.

753
00:43:54,007 --> 00:43:55,668
We're good!

754
00:43:55,842 --> 00:43:57,173
Get your helmet on.

755
00:43:57,802 --> 00:43:59,668
Scott, I'm gonna
send you back a week...

756
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,378
Let you walk around
for an hour,

757
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:02,974
then bring you back
in 10 seconds.

758
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:04,131
Make sense?

759
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:06,049
Perfectly not confusing.

760
00:44:06,227 --> 00:44:08,184
Good luck, Scott.
You got this.

761
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:12,769
You're right.
I do, captain america.

762
00:44:14,944 --> 00:44:16,275
On a count of three...

763
00:44:16,446 --> 00:44:20,314
Three, two, one.

764
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:21,898
(Machine whirs)

765
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:25,239
Uh... guys?

766
00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:27,287
This doesn't feel right.

767
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:28,363
Steve: What is this?

768
00:44:28,458 --> 00:44:29,448
-What's going on?
-Natasha: Who is that?

769
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:30,532
-Hold on.
-Is that Scott?

770
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:31,616
Yes, it's Scott.

771
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:37,122
-What's going on, Bruce?
-Oh, my back!

772
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,206
-What is this?
-Hold on a second.

773
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:39,291
Could I get
a little space here?

774
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:40,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Can you bring him back?

775
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:41,630
I'm working on it.

776
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:43,052
(Beeping)

777
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:49,676
It's a baby.

778
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:51,390
-It's Scott.
-Steve: As a baby.

779
00:44:51,564 --> 00:44:53,020
-Smart hulk: He'll grow.
-Bring Scott back.

780
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,563
When I say kill the power,
kill the power.

781
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:55,902
Oh, my god.

782
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:57,976
And... kill it!

783
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:04,194
Somebody peed my pants.

784
00:45:04,285 --> 00:45:05,320
Oh, thank god.

785
00:45:05,495 --> 00:45:08,704
But I Don't know
if it was baby me or old me.

786
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:14,000
Or just me me.

787
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:15,626
Time travel!

788
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:20,374
What?

789
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:24,294
I see this as an absolute win.

790
00:45:38,361 --> 00:45:40,944
-(Tires squealing)
(Engine roaring)

791
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:11,262
Why the long face?

792
00:46:11,436 --> 00:46:13,177
Let me guess,
he turned into a baby.

793
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:16,430
Among other things, yeah.
What are you doing here?

794
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:18,018
It's the epr paradox.

795
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:19,808
Instead of pushing lang
through time,

796
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:20,892
you might've wound up...

797
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:22,439
Pushing time through lang.

798
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:23,728
It's tricky, dangerous.

799
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:25,279
Somebody could have
cautioned you against it.

800
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:26,440
You did.

801
00:46:26,576 --> 00:46:27,782
Oh, did I?

802
00:46:27,952 --> 00:46:29,613
Well, thank god I'm here.

803
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:32,029
Regardless, I fixed it.

804
00:46:33,124 --> 00:46:35,411
A fully functioning
time-space GPS.

805
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:38,743
I just want peace.

806
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:43,089
Turns out resentment
is corrosive, and I hate it.

807
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:45,333
Me, too.

808
00:46:46,596 --> 00:46:48,052
We got a shot
at getting these stones,

809
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:50,050
but I gotta tell you
my priorities.

810
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,556
Bring back what we lost,
I hope, yes.

811
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:55,560
Keep what I found,
I have to, at all costs.

812
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:59,397
And maybe not die trying.

813
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:00,602
Would be nice.

814
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,151
Sounds like a deal.

815
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:25,714
(Sighs)

816
00:47:27,762 --> 00:47:28,752
Tony, I Don't know.

817
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:30,546
Why?

818
00:47:30,723 --> 00:47:32,509
He made it for you.

819
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,424
Plus, honestly, I have to
get it out of the garage

820
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:36,260
before Morgan
takes it sledding.

821
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:42,943
Thank you, Tony.

822
00:47:43,945 --> 00:47:45,481
Will you keep that
a little quiet?

823
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:47,562
Didn't bring one
for the whole team.

824
00:47:49,325 --> 00:47:52,613
We are getting
the whole team, yeah?

825
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:54,528
We're working on that
right now.

826
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,967
(Spaceship engine humming)

827
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,675
Rocket: Hey, humie.

828
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:16,011
Where's big green?

829
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:18,389
The kitchen, I think.

830
00:48:19,647 --> 00:48:20,853
That's awesome.

831
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:24,148
Rhodey, careful on re-entry.

832
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:26,025
There's an idiot
in the landing zone.

833
00:48:27,196 --> 00:48:28,311
Oh, god.

834
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:30,943
War machine: What's up,
regular-sized man?

835
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,366
(Calypso rock song playing)

836
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:24,250
Rocket: Kind of a step down
from the golden palaces

837
00:49:24,337 --> 00:49:26,078
and the magic hammers
and whatnot.

838
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,590
Hey, have
a little compassion, pal.

839
00:49:27,757 --> 00:49:29,714
First, they lost asgard,
then half their people.

840
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:31,420
They're probably just happy
to have a home.

841
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:33,301
You shouldn't have come.

842
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,969
Ah!

843
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:36,379
Valkyrie!

844
00:49:36,557 --> 00:49:39,265
Great to see you, angry girl!

845
00:49:39,435 --> 00:49:41,642
I think I liked you better
either of the other ways.

846
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:44,683
-This is rocket.
-How ya doing?

847
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:48,099
He won't see you.

848
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:49,479
It's that bad, huh?

849
00:49:49,654 --> 00:49:51,065
We only see him once a month

850
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:54,273
when he comes
in for "supplies."

851
00:49:55,368 --> 00:49:56,483
It's that bad.

852
00:49:56,661 --> 00:49:57,651
Yeah.

853
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:04,665
(Door creaks)

854
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:11,209
What the...?

855
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:12,882
-(Sniffs)
-(Floorboard creaking)

856
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:16,302
Whew! Something died in here!

857
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:19,677
-(Bottles clink)
-Smart hulk: Hello? Thor!

858
00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:21,887
Thor: Are you here
about the cable?

859
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:24,727
The cinemax went out
two weeks ago...

860
00:50:25,314 --> 00:50:28,056
And the sports are all
kinda fuzzy and whatnot.

861
00:50:28,818 --> 00:50:29,808
Smart hulk: Thor?

862
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:40,326
(Laughing) Boys! Oh, my god!

863
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:43,697
Oh, my god,
it's So good to see you!

864
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:46,453
Come here,
cuddly little rascal.

865
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:49,119
-Yeah, no, I'm good. I'm good.
-(Thor moans and laughs)

866
00:50:49,255 --> 00:50:50,336
That's not necessary.

867
00:50:50,798 --> 00:50:53,460
Hulk, you know my friends
miek and korg, right?

868
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:54,749
-Hey, boys!
-Smart hulk: Hey, guys.

869
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:56,167
Long time no see.

870
00:50:56,345 --> 00:50:57,335
Beer's in the bucket.

871
00:50:57,430 --> 00:50:58,591
Feel free to log on
to the Wi-Fi.

872
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:00,471
No password, obviously.

873
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:03,049
Thor, he's back.

874
00:51:03,227 --> 00:51:05,889
That kid on the TV just
called me a dickhead again.

875
00:51:06,439 --> 00:51:07,474
Noobmaster.

876
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:10,106
Korg: Yeah, noobmaster69
called me a dickhead.

877
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:11,437
I am sick of this.

878
00:51:12,361 --> 00:51:14,022
Noobmaster, hey,
it's Thor again.

879
00:51:14,113 --> 00:51:15,274
You know, the god of thunder.

880
00:51:15,448 --> 00:51:17,610
Listen, bud, if you don't log
off this game immediately...

881
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,285
I am gonna fly over
to your house,

882
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:20,900
come down to that basement
you're hiding in...

883
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:23,695
Rip off your arms,
and shove them up your butt!

884
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,162
Oh, that's right, yes!

885
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:27,115
Go cry to your father,
you little weasel.

886
00:51:27,835 --> 00:51:28,825
Thank you, Thor.

887
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,330
Let me know if
he bothers you again, okay?

888
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:31,710
Thank you very much. I will.

889
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:34,088
So, you guys want a drink?
What are we drinking?

890
00:51:34,175 --> 00:51:36,587
I've got beer, Tequila,
all sorts of things.

891
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,133
(Chuckles)

892
00:51:39,472 --> 00:51:40,883
Smart hulk: Buddy.

893
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:43,514
-You all right?
-Yes, I'm fine. Why?

894
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:44,719
Why, don't I look all right?

895
00:51:45,144 --> 00:51:46,555
You look
like melted ice cream.

896
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:47,931
(Laughs)

897
00:51:48,564 --> 00:51:50,646
So, what's up? You just here
for a hang, or what?

898
00:51:50,816 --> 00:51:52,932
-We need your help.
-Mm.

899
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:55,314
There might be a chance
we could fix everything.

900
00:51:55,488 --> 00:51:56,819
What, like the cable?

901
00:51:56,906 --> 00:51:59,193
(Burps) 'Cause that's been
driving me bananas for weeks.

902
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,356
Like thanos.

903
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:22,386
Don't say that name.

904
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:26,220
Um, yeah, we don't actually
say that name in here.

905
00:52:31,065 --> 00:52:32,931
Smart hulk: Please take
your hand off me.

906
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:39,400
Now, I Know that guy...

907
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:41,439
Might scare you.

908
00:52:41,617 --> 00:52:43,073
Why would I be...? (Scoffs)

909
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,323
Why would I be scared
of that guy?

910
00:52:46,497 --> 00:52:48,329
I'm the one
who killed that guy, remember?

911
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:49,576
Hmm.

912
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:51,533
Anyone else here
kill that guy?

913
00:52:54,964 --> 00:52:56,045
Nope.

914
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:57,580
Didn't think So.

915
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:00,508
Korg, why don't you, uh,
tell everybody

916
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,926
who chopped
thanos' big head off?

917
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,515
Um, stormbreaker?

918
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:06,298
Thor: Who was swinging
storm breaker?

919
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:12,603
I get it.
You're in a rough spot, okay??

920
00:53:12,773 --> 00:53:13,763
I've been there myself.

921
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:16,228
And you want to know
who helped me out of it?

922
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:18,734
(Slurring) Was it Natasha?

923
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:21,062
It was you.

924
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,197
You helped me.

925
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:25,866
So, why don't you ask...

926
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:29,286
The asgardians down there...

927
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:31,163
How much my help is worth?

928
00:53:36,839 --> 00:53:38,295
The ones
that are left, anyway.

929
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:40,423
I think we could
bring them back.

930
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:42,341
(Chuckles) Stop.

931
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,211
Stop, okay? (Sniffs)

932
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:46,512
I Know you think I'm down here

933
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:48,215
wallowing in my own
self-pity...

934
00:53:48,392 --> 00:53:50,929
Waiting to be rescued
and saved...

935
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:53,185
But I'm fine, okay.
We're fine, aren't we?

936
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:54,811
Oh, we're good here, mate.

937
00:53:54,982 --> 00:53:56,939
So, whatever it is that you're
offering, we're not into it.

938
00:53:57,109 --> 00:53:58,611
Don't care.
Couldn't care less.

939
00:53:58,777 --> 00:53:59,858
Goodbye.

940
00:54:00,529 --> 00:54:01,769
(Chuckles)

941
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:04,947
Smart hulk: We need you, pal.

942
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:07,650
(Sniffs)

943
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:10,032
(Chuckles quietly)

944
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:16,367
There's beer on the ship.

945
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:20,341
(Bottle clatters)

946
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:22,040
What kind?

947
00:54:29,308 --> 00:54:31,219
(Man shouts in Japanese)

948
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:33,559
-(Grunts)
-(Groans)

949
00:54:34,063 --> 00:54:35,053
(Man shouts in Japanese)

950
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:42,226
(Groans)

951
00:54:48,744 --> 00:54:50,405
(Gunfire)

952
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,335
(Grunts)

953
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:21,693
(Grunts)

954
00:55:27,992 --> 00:55:29,448
(Scoffs)

955
00:55:34,081 --> 00:55:35,537
(Both grunting)

956
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:53,684
(Shouts in Japanese)

957
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:54,802
(Yells)

958
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:57,222
(Gagging)

959
00:56:08,282 --> 00:56:11,365
(In English)
What I want you can't give me.

960
00:56:35,267 --> 00:56:36,428
You shouldn't be here.

961
00:56:39,146 --> 00:56:40,887
Neither should you.

962
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:48,360
I've got a job to do.

963
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:51,564
Natasha: Is that what
you're calling this?

964
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:55,071
Killing all these people isn't
gonna bring your family back.

965
00:57:00,918 --> 00:57:01,999
We found something.

966
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,832
A chance, maybe.

967
00:57:07,925 --> 00:57:10,383
(Sighs) Don't.

968
00:57:11,303 --> 00:57:12,759
Don't what?

969
00:57:15,808 --> 00:57:17,264
Don't give me hope.

970
00:57:20,604 --> 00:57:23,062
I'm sorry I couldn't
give it to you sooner.

971
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:37,944
(Rock and roll song playing)

972
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:45,914
You're drifting left.

973
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:48,212
One side there, lebowski.

974
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:52,712
Ratchet, how's it going?

975
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:53,876
It's rocket.

976
00:57:54,054 --> 00:57:56,591
Take it easy. You're only
a genius on earth, pal.

977
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:57,713
(Thor belches)

978
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,102
Rhodes: Time travel suit,
not bad.

979
00:58:04,565 --> 00:58:06,055
Hey, hey, hey!
Easy! Easy!

980
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,140
I'm being very careful.

981
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:08,728
No, you're being very hulky.

982
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:09,809
I'm being careful.

983
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:11,352
These are pym particles,
all right?

984
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:12,770
And ever since
Hank pym got snapped

985
00:58:12,865 --> 00:58:14,105
out of existence, this is it.

986
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:15,940
This is what we have.
We're not making any more.

987
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:18,029
-Scott, calm down.
-Scott: Sorry.

988
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:21,328
We've got enough for one
round-trip each. That's it.

989
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:22,533
No do-overs.

990
00:58:23,584 --> 00:58:24,915
Plus two test runs.

991
00:58:26,044 --> 00:58:27,421
-(Suit fastening)
-(Yells)

992
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:29,912
One test run.

993
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:31,174
(Sighs)

994
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:32,840
All right.
I'm not ready for this.

995
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:34,296
Barton: I'm game.

996
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,254
I'll do it.

997
00:58:38,891 --> 00:58:40,052
Smart hulk:
Clint, now you're gonna feel

998
00:58:40,142 --> 00:58:41,632
a little discombobulated
from the chronoshift.

999
00:58:41,727 --> 00:58:42,717
Don't worry about that.

1000
00:58:42,811 --> 00:58:43,926
Rhodes: Wait a second.
Let me ask you something.

1001
00:58:44,104 --> 00:58:45,720
If we can do this, you know...

1002
00:58:45,898 --> 00:58:48,230
Go back in time, why don't
we just find baby thanos?

1003
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,561
You know, and...

1004
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:54,645
First of all, that's horrible.

1005
00:58:54,740 --> 00:58:55,730
It's thanos.

1006
00:58:55,824 --> 00:58:57,906
And secondly,
time doesn't work that way.

1007
00:58:58,076 --> 00:59:00,238
Changing the past
doesn't change the future.

1008
00:59:00,412 --> 00:59:01,777
Look, we go back,
we get the stones

1009
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:03,112
before thanos gets them...

1010
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:06,032
Thanos doesn't have
the stones. Problem solved.

1011
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:08,042
-Bingo.
-That's not how it works.

1012
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:09,118
Well, that's what I heard.

1013
00:59:09,213 --> 00:59:10,328
Wait, but who?
Who told you that?

1014
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:12,291
Star Trek,
Terminator, timecop...

1015
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:14,048
-Time after time.
-Quantum leap.

1016
00:59:14,218 --> 00:59:15,253
Wrinkle in time,
somewhere in time.

1017
00:59:15,344 --> 00:59:16,334
Hot tub time machine.

1018
00:59:16,428 --> 00:59:17,463
Hot tub time machine.

1019
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:18,794
Bill and Ted's
excellent adventure.

1020
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:21,054
Basically, any movie
that deals with time travel.

1021
00:59:21,225 --> 00:59:23,057
Die hard.
No, that's not one.

1022
00:59:23,227 --> 00:59:24,262
This is known.

1023
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:25,642
I Don't know
why everyone believes that,

1024
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:26,764
but that isn't true.

1025
00:59:26,855 --> 00:59:28,846
Think about it.
If you travel to the past...

1026
00:59:29,024 --> 00:59:31,356
That past becomes
your future...

1027
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:34,484
And your former present
becomes the past...

1028
00:59:34,655 --> 00:59:37,272
Which can't now be changed
by your new future.

1029
00:59:37,449 --> 00:59:38,655
Exactly.

1030
00:59:39,243 --> 00:59:42,110
So back to the future
is a bunch of bullshit?

1031
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:47,998
-All right, Clint.
-(Beeping)

1032
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:51,164
We're going in three, two...

1033
00:59:51,338 --> 00:59:52,328
One.

1034
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:57,295
(Grunts)

1035
01:00:03,642 --> 01:00:05,349
(Yelling)

1036
01:00:07,688 --> 01:00:08,928
(Panting)

1037
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:10,725
(Gasps)

1038
01:00:31,753 --> 01:00:33,585
(Continues panting)

1039
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:06,034
Lila: Cooper?

1040
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:07,740
Where are my headphones?

1041
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:08,821
Lila?

1042
01:01:08,999 --> 01:01:11,036
-Cooper: I never had them.
-Lila?

1043
01:01:11,126 --> 01:01:12,116
(Beeping)

1044
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,826
Lila: Yeah,
you had them yesterday!

1045
01:01:14,421 --> 01:01:15,707
Lila! Lila!

1046
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:22,209
Yeah, dad?

1047
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:27,134
Dad?

1048
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:30,896
Lila!

1049
01:01:30,979 --> 01:01:32,515
(Grunting)

1050
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:39,192
Hey. Hey, look at me.

1051
01:01:39,363 --> 01:01:40,478
You okay?

1052
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:43,235
Yeah. Yeah. (Panting)

1053
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:46,321
It worked.

1054
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:49,445
It worked.

1055
01:01:52,584 --> 01:01:54,416
Steve: Okay, So the how works.

1056
01:01:55,087 --> 01:01:58,125
Now, we gotta figure out
the when and the where.

1057
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:00,751
Almost everyone in this room
has had an encounter...

1058
01:02:00,926 --> 01:02:02,587
With at least one of
the six infinity stones.

1059
01:02:02,761 --> 01:02:04,251
Or substitute
the word "encounter"...

1060
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:05,510
For "damn near been killed"

1061
01:02:05,597 --> 01:02:07,008
by one of
the six infinity stones.

1062
01:02:07,182 --> 01:02:08,343
Well, I haven't...

1063
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:09,423
But I Don't even know

1064
01:02:09,518 --> 01:02:10,849
what the hell
you're all talking about.

1065
01:02:11,019 --> 01:02:13,886
Regardless, we only have
enough pym particles

1066
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,766
for one round-trip each.

1067
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:17,147
And these stones have been

1068
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:19,145
in a lot of different places
throughout history.

1069
01:02:19,319 --> 01:02:20,605
Our history.

1070
01:02:20,779 --> 01:02:23,771
So, not a lot of convenient
spots to just drop in, yeah?

1071
01:02:23,949 --> 01:02:25,735
Which means we have to
pick our targets.

1072
01:02:26,201 --> 01:02:27,441
Correct.

1073
01:02:28,829 --> 01:02:30,411
So, let's start
with the aether.

1074
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,786
Thor, what do you know?

1075
01:02:37,379 --> 01:02:38,585
Natasha: Is he asleep?

1076
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:41,292
Rhodes: No, no.
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

1077
01:02:44,386 --> 01:02:46,047
Uh, where to start? Um...

1078
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:50,259
The aether, firstly,
is not a stone.

1079
01:02:50,725 --> 01:02:52,557
Someone called it
a stone before.

1080
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:57,938
Um, it's more of an angry
sludge sort of a thing...

1081
01:02:58,108 --> 01:02:59,724
So someone's gonna need
to amend that

1082
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:00,979
and stop saying that.

1083
01:03:01,445 --> 01:03:03,982
Here's an interesting story,
though, about the aether.

1084
01:03:04,156 --> 01:03:06,022
My grandfather,
many years ago...

1085
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:09,692
Had to hide the stone
from the dark elves.

1086
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:12,581
Ooh. (Chuckles) Scary beings.

1087
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:14,454
So, Jane, actually...

1088
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,577
Oh, there she is.

1089
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:20,411
Yeah, So Jane was
an old flame of mine.

1090
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:24,628
You know, she stuck her hand
inside a rock this one time...

1091
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:27,634
And then the aether
stuck itself inside her...

1092
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:29,840
And she became
very, very sick.

1093
01:03:30,015 --> 01:03:31,881
And So I had to
take her to asgard,

1094
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:33,136
which is where I'm from...

1095
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:35,267
And we had to try and fix her.

1096
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:37,053
We were dating at the time,
you see...

1097
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:40,598
And I got to introduce her
to my mother...

1098
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:43,980
(Sighs) Who's dead and, um...

1099
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:46,907
Oh, you know, Jane and I

1100
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:48,901
aren't even
dating anymore, So...

1101
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:49,982
(Mouthing)

1102
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:51,237
Yes, these things happen,
though. You know?

1103
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:52,700
Nothing lasts forever.
The only thing that...

1104
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:54,619
-Why don't you come sit down?
-I'm not done yet.

1105
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:56,325
The only thing
that is permanent in life

1106
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:57,827
is impermanence. (Laughs)

1107
01:03:58,585 --> 01:04:00,872
Awesome.
Eggs? Breakfast?

1108
01:04:01,046 --> 01:04:03,083
No. I'd like a bloody Mary.

1109
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:05,372
Rocket: Quill said he stole
the power stone from morag.

1110
01:04:06,468 --> 01:04:09,176
-Smart hulk: Is that a person?
-No, morag's a planet.

1111
01:04:09,888 --> 01:04:11,253
Quill was a person.

1112
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:14,347
Like a planet?
Like in outer space?

1113
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:15,929
Oh, look.

1114
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:18,727
It's like a little puppy,
all happy and everything.

1115
01:04:18,897 --> 01:04:22,060
Do you wanna go to space?
You wanna go to space, puppy?

1116
01:04:22,234 --> 01:04:23,349
I'll take you to space.

1117
01:04:24,736 --> 01:04:26,647
Nebula: Thanos found
the soul stone on vormir.

1118
01:04:26,821 --> 01:04:28,778
What is vormir?

1119
01:04:28,949 --> 01:04:30,110
Nebula: A dominion of death...

1120
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:32,691
At the very center
of celestial existence.

1121
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:38,615
It's where
thanos murdered my sister.

1122
01:04:42,754 --> 01:04:43,869
(Steve sighs)

1123
01:04:45,048 --> 01:04:46,083
Not it.

1124
01:04:47,926 --> 01:04:49,462
Natasha: That time stone guy.
Smart hulk: Doctor strange.

1125
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:51,422
Natasha: Yeah,
what kind of doctor was he?

1126
01:04:51,596 --> 01:04:53,553
Tony: Ear-nose-throat
meets rabbit-from-hat.

1127
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:55,100
Smart hulk: Nice place
in the village, though.

1128
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:56,765
Tony: Yeah,
on Sullivan street?

1129
01:04:56,935 --> 01:04:57,970
Smart hulk:
Mm... bleecker street.

1130
01:04:58,103 --> 01:04:59,184
Wait, he lived in New York?

1131
01:04:59,771 --> 01:05:00,806
Tony: No, he lived in Toronto.

1132
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:01,932
Uh, yeah,
on bleecker and Sullivan.

1133
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:03,013
Have you been listening
to anything?

1134
01:05:03,108 --> 01:05:04,098
Guys.

1135
01:05:04,192 --> 01:05:05,853
If you pick the right year,

1136
01:05:05,944 --> 01:05:07,560
there are three stones
in New York.

1137
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:11,738
Shut the front door.

1138
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:16,610
Steve: All right.
We have a plan.

1139
01:05:16,788 --> 01:05:21,373
Six stones, three teams,
one shot.

1140
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:32,960
Steve: Five years ago,
we lost.

1141
01:05:34,306 --> 01:05:35,592
All of us.

1142
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:38,882
We lost friends.

1143
01:05:39,603 --> 01:05:41,264
We lost family.

1144
01:05:43,231 --> 01:05:45,063
We lost a part of ourselves.

1145
01:05:46,526 --> 01:05:48,858
Today, we have a chance
to take it all back.

1146
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:53,113
You know your teams.
You know your missions.

1147
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,861
Get the stones. Get them back.

1148
01:05:56,703 --> 01:05:57,864
One round-trip each.

1149
01:05:58,038 --> 01:05:59,119
No mistakes...

1150
01:05:59,623 --> 01:06:01,330
No do-overs.

1151
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:03,365
Most of us are going
somewhere we know.

1152
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:05,375
That doesn't mean
we should know what to expect.

1153
01:06:06,546 --> 01:06:07,536
Be careful.

1154
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:09,466
Look out for each other.

1155
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:12,711
This is the fight
of our lives...

1156
01:06:13,595 --> 01:06:15,177
And we're gonna win.

1157
01:06:17,349 --> 01:06:18,339
Whatever it takes.

1158
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:23,059
Good luck.

1159
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:24,310
He's pretty good at that.

1160
01:06:24,481 --> 01:06:25,642
-Right?
-Tony: All right.

1161
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:26,805
You heard the man.

1162
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:28,140
Stroke those keys,
jolly green.

1163
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:30,646
Smart hulk: Trackers engaged.

1164
01:06:31,446 --> 01:06:33,278
You promise to bring that back
in one piece, right?

1165
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:34,779
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1166
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:36,815
Okay, I'll do my best.

1167
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:38,779
As promises go,
that was pretty lame.

1168
01:06:41,414 --> 01:06:42,996
-(Beeping)
-See ya in a minute.

1169
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:17,659
(Chitauri snarling)

1170
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:20,404
(Roars)

1171
01:07:20,495 --> 01:07:22,736
(Roaring)

1172
01:07:37,429 --> 01:07:38,715
All right, we all have
our assignments.

1173
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:41,095
Two stones uptown,
one stone down.

1174
01:07:41,266 --> 01:07:43,177
Stay low.
Keep an eye on the clock.

1175
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:44,349
(Thud)

1176
01:07:50,859 --> 01:07:52,224
(Roaring)

1177
01:07:58,658 --> 01:08:00,444
Maybe smash
a few things along the way.

1178
01:08:01,578 --> 01:08:03,569
I think it's gratuitous,
but whatever.

1179
01:08:06,166 --> 01:08:07,873
(Roaring softly)

1180
01:08:15,884 --> 01:08:16,874
(Roars softly)

1181
01:08:31,316 --> 01:08:32,772
Ancient one:
I'd be careful going that way.

1182
01:08:32,859 --> 01:08:34,475
We just had the floors waxed.

1183
01:08:39,824 --> 01:08:41,440
Yeah, I'm looking
for doctor strange.

1184
01:08:43,036 --> 01:08:45,903
You're about
five years too early.

1185
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:48,822
Stephen strange is currently
performing surgery

1186
01:08:48,917 --> 01:08:50,407
about 20 blocks that way.

1187
01:08:52,212 --> 01:08:53,202
What do you want from him?

1188
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,120
That, actually.

1189
01:08:56,090 --> 01:08:57,171
Ah!

1190
01:08:58,343 --> 01:08:59,333
I'm afraid not.

1191
01:08:59,761 --> 01:09:01,126
Sorry, but I wasn't asking.

1192
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:03,045
You don't want to do this.

1193
01:09:03,223 --> 01:09:04,884
Ah, you're right, I Don't.
But I need that stone...

1194
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:06,476
And I Don't have time
to debate it.

1195
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:08,550
(Grunts)

1196
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:17,067
Let's start over, shall we?

1197
01:09:28,623 --> 01:09:30,205
Asgardian maiden:
For you, lady Jane.

1198
01:09:30,291 --> 01:09:32,669
Jane: Um, So you have anything
with pants?

1199
01:09:32,836 --> 01:09:33,951
Asgardian maiden: Pants?

1200
01:09:34,045 --> 01:09:36,127
Jane: Never mind.
These will be fine. Thank you.

1201
01:09:36,297 --> 01:09:37,913
Asgardian maiden: Yes, milady.
Thor: Oh, there's Jane.

1202
01:09:39,551 --> 01:09:40,541
All right.

1203
01:09:42,136 --> 01:09:43,388
Here's the deal, tubby.

1204
01:09:43,555 --> 01:09:44,590
You're gonna charm her,

1205
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:45,921
and I'm gonna poke her
with this thing...

1206
01:09:46,099 --> 01:09:48,557
And extract the reality stone,
and get gone lickety-split.

1207
01:09:48,768 --> 01:09:49,929
(Sniffs)

1208
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:51,426
I'll be right back, okay?

1209
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:53,262
The wine cellar
is just down here.

1210
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:56,306
My father used to have this
huge barrel of aakonian ale.

1211
01:09:56,484 --> 01:09:57,861
I'll see if the scullery has
a couple of to-go cups.

1212
01:09:57,944 --> 01:09:59,776
Hey. Hey! Aren't you
drunk enough already?

1213
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:01,945
(Door opens and closes)

1214
01:10:07,161 --> 01:10:08,151
If you could send loki
some soup.

1215
01:10:08,246 --> 01:10:09,236
Yes, milady.

1216
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:10,320
And ask our librarians

1217
01:10:10,415 --> 01:10:13,248
to pull some volumes
from the astronomy shelf.

1218
01:10:19,424 --> 01:10:20,960
Who's the fancy broad?

1219
01:10:22,302 --> 01:10:23,792
That's my mother.

1220
01:10:24,304 --> 01:10:26,011
She dies today.

1221
01:10:26,681 --> 01:10:28,467
Oh, that is today?

1222
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:33,935
(Breathes heavily)

1223
01:10:35,023 --> 01:10:37,560
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

1224
01:10:38,151 --> 01:10:39,687
I shouldn't be here.
I shouldn't have come.

1225
01:10:39,861 --> 01:10:40,976
It's a bad ideal

1226
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:42,314
-come here.
-No, no, no.

1227
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:44,900
I think I'm having
a panic attack.

1228
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,981
Come here. Right here.

1229
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:47,065
I shouldn't be here.
This is bad.

1230
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:49,576
You think you're the only one
who lost people?

1231
01:10:49,662 --> 01:10:51,494
What do you think
we're doing here?

1232
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:53,826
I lost the only family
I ever had.

1233
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,412
Quill, groot, drax,
the chick with the antenna...

1234
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:57,997
All gone.

1235
01:10:58,713 --> 01:11:00,044
I get you miss your mom...

1236
01:11:00,340 --> 01:11:01,546
But she's gone.

1237
01:11:01,716 --> 01:11:02,706
Really gone.

1238
01:11:03,301 --> 01:11:06,134
And there are plenty of people
who are only kind of gone...

1239
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:07,419
And you can help them.

1240
01:11:08,556 --> 01:11:10,058
So, is it too much to ask

1241
01:11:10,141 --> 01:11:11,757
that you brush the crumbs
out of your beard...

1242
01:11:11,935 --> 01:11:14,222
Make schmoopy talk
to pretty pants...

1243
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:17,554
And when she's not looking,
suck out the infinity stone...

1244
01:11:17,732 --> 01:11:19,314
And help me
get my family back?

1245
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:21,982
(Sighs) Okay.

1246
01:11:22,278 --> 01:11:23,268
Are you crying?

1247
01:11:23,905 --> 01:11:25,191
(Sobbing) No.

1248
01:11:27,033 --> 01:11:28,194
Yes.

1249
01:11:28,368 --> 01:11:29,574
I feel like I'm losing it.

1250
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:30,734
Get it together!

1251
01:11:30,912 --> 01:11:32,744
-You can do this.
-(Exhales)

1252
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:34,408
You can do this.

1253
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,502
(Taking deep breaths)

1254
01:11:37,585 --> 01:11:38,575
All right?

1255
01:11:38,753 --> 01:11:39,743
Yes, I can.

1256
01:11:39,921 --> 01:11:40,911
Good.

1257
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:45,464
I can do this. I can do this.

1258
01:11:46,302 --> 01:11:47,758
I can't do this.

1259
01:11:47,929 --> 01:11:49,795
All right, heartbreaker,
she's alone.

1260
01:11:49,889 --> 01:11:51,345
This is our shot.

1261
01:11:51,516 --> 01:11:54,099
Thor? Thor!

1262
01:11:55,061 --> 01:11:56,051
(Groans)

1263
01:12:04,404 --> 01:12:05,735
War machine: All right,
bring it down, blue.

1264
01:12:05,905 --> 01:12:08,317
Right on that line. That's it.
Down, down.

1265
01:12:11,285 --> 01:12:12,366
(Snarls)

1266
01:12:13,121 --> 01:12:14,657
-(Sighs)
-Hey, can we hurry it up?

1267
01:12:14,831 --> 01:12:16,913
Guys, chop-chop. Come on.
We're on the clock.

1268
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:18,824
All that is really helpful.

1269
01:12:21,045 --> 01:12:22,547
-Take care, okay?
-Yeah.

1270
01:12:22,714 --> 01:12:25,172
Get that stone and come back.
No messing around.

1271
01:12:25,717 --> 01:12:27,378
-Hey.
-We got this.

1272
01:12:27,552 --> 01:12:28,758
-Let's get it done.
-Yes, sir.

1273
01:12:28,928 --> 01:12:30,214
I'll see you back.

1274
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:32,261
You guys watch
each other's six.

1275
01:12:32,932 --> 01:12:34,172
Yeah.

1276
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:44,395
Nebula: Coordinates for vormir
are laid in.

1277
01:12:46,029 --> 01:12:47,940
All they have to do
is not fall out.

1278
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:56,237
We're a long way
from Budapest.

1279
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:57,536
(Chuckles)

1280
01:13:01,127 --> 01:13:02,617
Okay, So, uh...

1281
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:07,089
We just wait around for
this quill guy to show up...

1282
01:13:07,258 --> 01:13:09,090
And then he leads us to
the power stone, is that it?

1283
01:13:10,094 --> 01:13:11,505
Let's take cover.

1284
01:13:13,139 --> 01:13:15,597
We're not the only ones in
2014 looking for the stones.

1285
01:13:15,683 --> 01:13:17,094
Wait a minute. What are you
talking about right now?

1286
01:13:17,185 --> 01:13:18,516
Who else is looking
for these stones?

1287
01:13:22,148 --> 01:13:23,559
My father...

1288
01:13:23,733 --> 01:13:25,519
My sister...

1289
01:13:25,693 --> 01:13:26,808
And me.

1290
01:13:26,986 --> 01:13:28,147
And you?

1291
01:13:30,031 --> 01:13:31,613
Where are you right now?

1292
01:13:32,533 --> 01:13:33,523
(Yelling)

1293
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,289
(Beeping)

1294
01:13:43,461 --> 01:13:45,077
(Grunting)

1295
01:13:47,465 --> 01:13:48,455
(Yelling)

1296
01:13:54,055 --> 01:13:55,295
(Sighs)

1297
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:57,596
(Grunts)

1298
01:14:00,311 --> 01:14:01,472
Gamora: You're welcome.

1299
01:14:01,646 --> 01:14:03,933
I didn't ask for your help.

1300
01:14:04,607 --> 01:14:06,223
And yet, you always need it.

1301
01:14:07,026 --> 01:14:08,642
-(Sighs)
-(Gamora chuckles)

1302
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:12,270
Get up. Father wants us
back on the ship.

1303
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:13,438
Why?

1304
01:14:13,616 --> 01:14:15,607
He's found an infinity stone.

1305
01:14:20,123 --> 01:14:21,579
2014 nebula: Where?

1306
01:14:21,749 --> 01:14:23,490
Gamora: On a planet
called morag.

1307
01:14:25,128 --> 01:14:27,039
Father's plan
is finally in motion.

1308
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:29,204
One stone isn't six, nebula.

1309
01:14:29,382 --> 01:14:30,588
It's a start.

1310
01:14:30,758 --> 01:14:32,544
If he gets all of them...

1311
01:14:34,929 --> 01:14:36,340
(Thud)

1312
01:14:45,565 --> 01:14:47,306
Ronan's located
the power stone.

1313
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,107
I'm dispatching you
to his ship.

1314
01:14:49,277 --> 01:14:50,483
He won't like that.

1315
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:52,769
His alternative is death.

1316
01:14:54,282 --> 01:14:56,023
Ronan's obsession...

1317
01:14:57,076 --> 01:14:59,238
Clouds his judgment.

1318
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:05,452
We will not fail you, father.

1319
01:15:06,502 --> 01:15:08,118
No, you won't.

1320
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:11,830
I swear...

1321
01:15:13,718 --> 01:15:15,629
I will make you proud.

1322
01:15:17,054 --> 01:15:19,091
(Groaning)

1323
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:27,684
...we just wait around for
this quill guy to show up...

1324
01:15:27,857 --> 01:15:29,848
And then he leads us to
the power stone, is that it?

1325
01:15:30,026 --> 01:15:31,608
Nebula: Let's take cover.

1326
01:15:32,612 --> 01:15:35,479
We're not the only ones in
2014 looking for the stones.

1327
01:15:36,115 --> 01:15:37,230
(Grunts)

1328
01:15:37,909 --> 01:15:39,365
Who was that?

1329
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:40,616
I Don't know. (Gasping)

1330
01:15:40,703 --> 01:15:42,865
My head is splitting.
I Don't know.

1331
01:15:44,332 --> 01:15:47,290
Her synaptic drive was
probably damaged in battle.

1332
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,291
Shh.

1333
01:15:57,553 --> 01:15:59,590
Bring her to my ship.

1334
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:08,053
Iron man: Better hustle, cap.

1335
01:16:08,231 --> 01:16:10,313
Things look like they're
just about wrapped up here.

1336
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:12,106
Captain america: Got it. I'm
approaching the elevator now.

1337
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:20,156
Loki: If it's all the same
to you...

1338
01:16:22,453 --> 01:16:23,989
I'll have that drink now.

1339
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:25,994
2012 iron man: All right,
get him on his feet.

1340
01:16:26,165 --> 01:16:29,157
We can all stand around
posing up a storm later.

1341
01:16:29,335 --> 01:16:30,666
By the way,
feel free to clean up.

1342
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:33,836
(Scoffs) Mr. Rogers, I almost
forgot that that suit...

1343
01:16:34,006 --> 01:16:35,713
Did nothing for your ass.

1344
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,165
Captain america: No one
asked you to look, Tony.

1345
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:38,250
It's ridiculous.

1346
01:16:38,344 --> 01:16:39,459
Ant-man:
I think you look great, cap.

1347
01:16:39,553 --> 01:16:41,965
As far as I'm concerned,
that's america's ass.

1348
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:44,013
2012 black widow:
Who gets the, uh, magic wand?

1349
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:45,306
2012 captain america.:
S.T.R.I.K.E. Team's

1350
01:16:45,393 --> 01:16:46,554
-coming to secure it.
-(Elevator beeps)

1351
01:16:56,487 --> 01:16:58,228
Sitwell: We can take that
off your hands.

1352
01:16:58,406 --> 01:16:59,396
By all means.

1353
01:17:01,659 --> 01:17:03,366
Careful with that thing.

1354
01:17:03,536 --> 01:17:04,992
Yeah, unless you want
your mind erased.

1355
01:17:05,162 --> 01:17:06,152
And not in a fun way.

1356
01:17:06,289 --> 01:17:07,279
We promise to be careful.

1357
01:17:07,373 --> 01:17:08,488
Ant-man: (On speakers)
Who are these guys?

1358
01:17:08,666 --> 01:17:09,952
They are S H.I.E.L.D.

1359
01:17:10,126 --> 01:17:13,209
Well, actually hydra,
but we didn't know that yet.

1360
01:17:13,379 --> 01:17:15,541
Ant-man: Seriously?
You didn't?

1361
01:17:15,715 --> 01:17:17,205
I mean,
they look like bad guys.

1362
01:17:17,383 --> 01:17:18,794
You're small,
but you're talking loud.

1363
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:20,800
On my way down to coordinate
search and rescue.

1364
01:17:20,970 --> 01:17:22,927
On my way down to coordinate
search and rescue.

1365
01:17:23,097 --> 01:17:25,555
I mean, honestly, how do you
keep your food down?

1366
01:17:25,725 --> 01:17:27,136
Shut up.

1367
01:17:27,727 --> 01:17:29,013
Ooh. All right, you're up,
little buddy.

1368
01:17:29,186 --> 01:17:31,314
There's our stone.

1369
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:32,470
Ant-man: All right.

1370
01:17:32,648 --> 01:17:33,809
Flick me.

1371
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:48,994
-Move.
-Hey.

1372
01:17:49,081 --> 01:17:50,822
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-Hey, hey. Buddy!

1373
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,786
What do you think? Maximum
occupancy has been reached.

1374
01:17:52,877 --> 01:17:53,958
-(Growls)
-Take the stairs.

1375
01:17:54,128 --> 01:17:55,710
2012 Tony: Yeah. Stop, stop.

1376
01:17:55,796 --> 01:17:57,173
(Roars)

1377
01:17:58,758 --> 01:18:02,126
"Take the stairs."
Hate the stairs. (Grunts)

1378
01:18:05,264 --> 01:18:07,631
All right, cap, I got
our scepter in the elevator...

1379
01:18:07,808 --> 01:18:09,594
Just passing the 80th floor.

1380
01:18:10,394 --> 01:18:11,384
On it.

1381
01:18:11,979 --> 01:18:12,969
Head to the lobby.

1382
01:18:13,064 --> 01:18:14,099
Iron man: All right,
I'll see you there.

1383
01:18:14,482 --> 01:18:16,064
Sitwell: Evidence secure.

1384
01:18:16,233 --> 01:18:17,644
We're en route to doctor list.

1385
01:18:18,361 --> 01:18:21,228
No. No hitches at all,
Mr. Secretary.

1386
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:27,400
Captain.

1387
01:18:27,495 --> 01:18:28,610
I thought
you were coordinating

1388
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:29,694
search and rescue.

1389
01:18:29,789 --> 01:18:31,325
Captain america:
Change of plans.

1390
01:18:35,169 --> 01:18:36,580
Hey, cap.

1391
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:38,915
Rumiow.

1392
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:47,053
I just got a call
from the secretary.

1393
01:18:47,223 --> 01:18:49,089
I'm gonna be running point
on the scepter.

1394
01:18:51,602 --> 01:18:53,843
Sir?
I Don't understand.

1395
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:58,147
We got word there may be
an attempt to steal it.

1396
01:18:58,317 --> 01:18:59,899
Sorry, cap.

1397
01:19:00,069 --> 01:19:01,480
We can't give you the scepter.

1398
01:19:02,071 --> 01:19:03,937
I'm gonna have to call
the director.

1399
01:19:04,115 --> 01:19:06,231
That's okay. Trust me.

1400
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:10,735
Hail hydra.

1401
01:19:14,917 --> 01:19:16,078
(Elevator beeps)

1402
01:19:24,135 --> 01:19:25,375
(Groans)

1403
01:19:25,469 --> 01:19:27,335
So many stairs!

1404
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:28,636
(Elevator bell dings)

1405
01:19:30,808 --> 01:19:32,139
(Indistinct chatter)

1406
01:19:39,066 --> 01:19:41,683
Thumbelina, do you copy?
I've got eyes on the prize.

1407
01:19:41,861 --> 01:19:42,942
It is go time.

1408
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:44,109
Ant-man: (On speakers)
Bombs away.

1409
01:19:45,156 --> 01:19:46,146
(Ant-man grunts)

1410
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:53,737
Is that axe body spray?

1411
01:19:53,914 --> 01:19:56,201
Yeah, I had a can in the desk
for emergencies. Relax.

1412
01:19:56,292 --> 01:19:57,373
Can we focus, please?

1413
01:19:57,543 --> 01:19:58,783
Ant-man:
I'm going inside you...

1414
01:19:59,503 --> 01:20:00,493
Now.

1415
01:20:06,385 --> 01:20:07,921
Uh, may I ask you
where you're going?

1416
01:20:08,012 --> 01:20:10,344
Bit of lunch and then asgard.
I'm sorry, you are...?

1417
01:20:10,431 --> 01:20:11,512
Alexander Pierce.

1418
01:20:11,599 --> 01:20:12,885
He's the man above the folks

1419
01:20:12,975 --> 01:20:14,136
-behind Nick fury.
-Oh.

1420
01:20:14,226 --> 01:20:15,432
My friends call me
Mr. Secretary.

1421
01:20:15,519 --> 01:20:16,509
I'm gonna have to ask you

1422
01:20:16,604 --> 01:20:17,890
to turn that prisoner
over to me.

1423
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:19,846
Uh, loki will be answering
to Odin himself.

1424
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:21,021
Pierce: No, he's going
to answer to us.

1425
01:20:21,108 --> 01:20:22,394
Odin can have what's left.

1426
01:20:22,568 --> 01:20:24,024
And I'm gonna need that case.

1427
01:20:24,195 --> 01:20:25,981
That's been S.H.I.E.L.D.
property for over 70 years.

1428
01:20:26,155 --> 01:20:27,145
Hand over the case, stark.

1429
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:28,695
(Inhales sharply) All right,
move it, Stuart little.

1430
01:20:28,782 --> 01:20:29,988
Things are getting dicey
out here. Let's go.

1431
01:20:30,075 --> 01:20:31,782
I'm not gonna argue who's got
the higher authority here...

1432
01:20:32,244 --> 01:20:33,530
Ant-man: You promise me
you won't die?

1433
01:20:33,704 --> 01:20:36,412
We're only giving me
a mild cardiac dysrhythmia.

1434
01:20:36,582 --> 01:20:38,164
Ant-man:
That doesn't sound mild.

1435
01:20:38,334 --> 01:20:39,324
I need the case.

1436
01:20:39,418 --> 01:20:40,783
I Know you got a lot of pull,
I'm just saying,

1437
01:20:40,878 --> 01:20:42,209
-jurisdiction...
-Okay, then give me the case.

1438
01:20:42,379 --> 01:20:43,369
2012 Tony:
Well, jurisdiction...

1439
01:20:43,464 --> 01:20:44,454
Agent: Hand it over.

1440
01:20:44,548 --> 01:20:45,538
Do it, lang!

1441
01:20:45,633 --> 01:20:46,623
Get your hands off me.

1442
01:20:46,717 --> 01:20:48,173
Window's closing. Pull my pin.

1443
01:20:48,636 --> 01:20:49,876
Ant-man: Here goes!

1444
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:51,552
(Gasping and choking)

1445
01:20:52,723 --> 01:20:54,259
-Stark?
-2012 Thor: Stark?

1446
01:20:55,601 --> 01:20:56,762
Agent: He's convulsing.
Give him air!

1447
01:20:56,852 --> 01:20:58,559
-Medic!
-Medic!

1448
01:20:59,104 --> 01:21:00,481
Give these guys some help.

1449
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:02,233
-2012 Thor: Speak to me.
-(Gasping)

1450
01:21:02,316 --> 01:21:04,102
(Stammers) Stark,
is it your chest machine?

1451
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:08,193
Breathe, breathe.

1452
01:21:13,452 --> 01:21:14,692
Tony: Good job.
Meet me in the alley.

1453
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:15,777
I'm gonna grab a quick slice.

1454
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:17,953
(Hulk roars)

1455
01:21:21,502 --> 01:21:23,209
No stairs!

1456
01:21:23,587 --> 01:21:25,169
(People screaming)

1457
01:21:30,344 --> 01:21:32,711
Uh... come on, stark,
stay with us.

1458
01:21:32,805 --> 01:21:33,795
I'm going to try something.
Okay?

1459
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:35,004
I have no idea
if it's going to work.

1460
01:21:35,683 --> 01:21:37,845
-(Grunts, exhales)
-Yes!

1461
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:39,395
Oh, that worked a treat.

1462
01:21:39,562 --> 01:21:40,552
Dude, that was So crazy.

1463
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:42,106
I had no idea
if that was gonna work.

1464
01:21:42,273 --> 01:21:44,139
-The case.
-The case is, uh...

1465
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:46,307
Where's the case?
Where's loki?

1466
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:48,309
Loki!

1467
01:21:48,404 --> 01:21:49,860
Ant-man: That wasn't supposed
to happen, was it?

1468
01:21:49,947 --> 01:21:51,028
Oh, we blew it.

1469
01:21:51,115 --> 01:21:52,605
Loki?

1470
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:54,156
(Alarm blaring)

1471
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:55,946
Tony, what's going on?

1472
01:21:56,954 --> 01:21:58,615
Tell me you found that cube.

1473
01:22:00,249 --> 01:22:01,410
(Sighs)

1474
01:22:01,500 --> 01:22:02,911
Oh, you gotta be shitting me.

1475
01:22:07,006 --> 01:22:09,213
I have eyes on loki.
14th floor.

1476
01:22:09,383 --> 01:22:10,748
I'm not loki...

1477
01:22:14,346 --> 01:22:15,962
And I Don't wanna hurt you.

1478
01:22:19,226 --> 01:22:20,603
(Both grunting)

1479
01:22:23,689 --> 01:22:24,804
(Pants)

1480
01:22:24,898 --> 01:22:25,888
I can do this all day.

1481
01:22:26,066 --> 01:22:27,352
Yeah, I Know.

1482
01:22:27,526 --> 01:22:28,516
I Know.

1483
01:22:29,486 --> 01:22:30,692
(Both grunt)

1484
01:22:52,426 --> 01:22:53,416
(Pants)

1485
01:22:59,224 --> 01:23:00,350
(Panting)

1486
01:23:01,268 --> 01:23:02,258
Where did you get this?

1487
01:23:05,314 --> 01:23:07,055
(Both grunting)

1488
01:23:13,572 --> 01:23:16,610
Bucky is alive.

1489
01:23:19,078 --> 01:23:20,068
(Coughs)

1490
01:23:20,162 --> 01:23:21,197
What?

1491
01:23:30,923 --> 01:23:32,334
(Panting)

1492
01:23:36,136 --> 01:23:37,672
That is america's ass.

1493
01:23:42,059 --> 01:23:43,140
Banner: Please, please.

1494
01:23:43,227 --> 01:23:45,093
I'm sorry,
I can't help you, Bruce.

1495
01:23:46,146 --> 01:23:47,477
If I give up the time stone

1496
01:23:47,564 --> 01:23:49,271
to help your reality,
I'm dooming my own.

1497
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:51,182
With all due respect,
all right...

1498
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:54,443
I'm not sure the science
really supports that.

1499
01:24:00,077 --> 01:24:02,034
The infinity stones create

1500
01:24:02,121 --> 01:24:04,362
what you experience
as the flow of time.

1501
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:06,076
Remove one of the stones...

1502
01:24:06,250 --> 01:24:08,332
And that flow splits.

1503
01:24:08,502 --> 01:24:10,960
Now, this may benefit
your reality...

1504
01:24:11,130 --> 01:24:13,246
But my new one, not So much.

1505
01:24:13,632 --> 01:24:15,339
In this new branch reality...

1506
01:24:15,509 --> 01:24:17,170
Without our chief weapon

1507
01:24:17,261 --> 01:24:18,592
against the forces
of darkness...

1508
01:24:19,012 --> 01:24:20,923
Our world would be overrun.

1509
01:24:21,098 --> 01:24:22,805
Millions will suffer.

1510
01:24:22,975 --> 01:24:24,215
So, tell me, doctor.

1511
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:26,972
Can your science
prevent all that?

1512
01:24:27,146 --> 01:24:28,136
No...

1513
01:24:29,148 --> 01:24:30,263
But we can erase it.

1514
01:24:30,441 --> 01:24:32,148
Because once we're done
with the stones...

1515
01:24:32,317 --> 01:24:34,479
We can return each one
to its own timeline...

1516
01:24:34,653 --> 01:24:36,155
At the moment it was taken.

1517
01:24:36,321 --> 01:24:38,779
So, chronologically...

1518
01:24:39,825 --> 01:24:40,860
In that reality...

1519
01:24:43,454 --> 01:24:45,115
It never left.

1520
01:24:47,499 --> 01:24:50,582
Yes, but you're leaving out
the most important part.

1521
01:24:54,173 --> 01:24:56,631
In order to return the stones,
you have to survive.

1522
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:59,383
We will. I will. I promise.

1523
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:02,257
I can't risk this reality
on a promise.

1524
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:06,674
It's the duty
of the sorcerer supreme

1525
01:25:06,769 --> 01:25:08,555
to protect the time stone.

1526
01:25:08,937 --> 01:25:10,803
Then why the hell did
strange give it away?

1527
01:25:12,775 --> 01:25:13,856
What did you say?

1528
01:25:14,026 --> 01:25:16,358
Strange. He gave it away.
He gave it to thanos.

1529
01:25:16,987 --> 01:25:18,569
-Willingly?
-Yes.

1530
01:25:22,493 --> 01:25:24,154
-Why?
-I have no idea.

1531
01:25:24,244 --> 01:25:25,985
Maybe he made a mistake.

1532
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:37,417
Or I did.

1533
01:25:57,694 --> 01:26:00,106
Strange is meant to be
the best of us.

1534
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:02,772
So, he must've done it
for a reason.

1535
01:26:03,575 --> 01:26:05,191
I fear you might be right.

1536
01:26:08,163 --> 01:26:09,278
(Smart hulk sighs)

1537
01:26:10,374 --> 01:26:11,364
Thank you.

1538
01:26:17,631 --> 01:26:19,292
I'm counting on you, Bruce.

1539
01:26:21,343 --> 01:26:22,549
We all are.

1540
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:44,567
Run diagnostics.

1541
01:26:45,325 --> 01:26:47,282
Show me her memory file.

1542
01:26:48,871 --> 01:26:51,329
Sire, the file
appears entangled.

1543
01:26:52,499 --> 01:26:54,456
It was a memory, but not hers.

1544
01:26:55,711 --> 01:26:57,122
There's another
consciousness...

1545
01:26:57,296 --> 01:26:58,582
Sharing her network.

1546
01:26:59,131 --> 01:27:00,462
Another nebula.

1547
01:27:02,593 --> 01:27:04,049
Impossible.

1548
01:27:04,219 --> 01:27:06,836
Ebony maw: This duplicate
carries a time stamp...

1549
01:27:07,764 --> 01:27:09,926
From nine years in the future.

1550
01:27:14,521 --> 01:27:17,013
Where is this other nebula?

1551
01:27:17,691 --> 01:27:19,682
Ebony maw: In our solar system
on morag.

1552
01:27:21,236 --> 01:27:22,522
Can you access her?

1553
01:27:22,696 --> 01:27:24,733
Ebony maw:
Yes, the two are linked.

1554
01:27:24,907 --> 01:27:26,989
Search the duplicate's
memories...

1555
01:27:27,159 --> 01:27:29,366
For infinity stones.

1556
01:27:32,915 --> 01:27:34,076
Banner:
And these stones have been

1557
01:27:34,166 --> 01:27:35,873
in a lot of different places
throughout history.

1558
01:27:36,043 --> 01:27:37,124
Our history.

1559
01:27:37,210 --> 01:27:39,338
So, not a lot
of convenient spots

1560
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:40,630
to just drop in.

1561
01:27:40,797 --> 01:27:42,458
Barton: Which means
we have to pick our targets.

1562
01:27:42,633 --> 01:27:43,919
Tony: Correct.
Thanos: Freeze image.

1563
01:27:45,886 --> 01:27:47,092
Gamora: Terrans.

1564
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:49,841
Avengers.

1565
01:27:50,933 --> 01:27:52,640
Unruly wretches.

1566
01:27:52,809 --> 01:27:54,311
What's that reflection?

1567
01:27:55,938 --> 01:27:57,099
Amplify this, maw.

1568
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:01,815
Gamora: I Don't understand.

1569
01:28:06,531 --> 01:28:08,113
Two nebulas.

1570
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:10,695
Thanos: No.
The same nebula...

1571
01:28:11,495 --> 01:28:13,236
From two different times.

1572
01:28:14,539 --> 01:28:16,155
Set course for morag.

1573
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:18,700
And scan
the duplicate's memories.

1574
01:28:19,461 --> 01:28:21,828
I wanna see everything.

1575
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:33,680
My ladies, I'll see you after.

1576
01:28:33,767 --> 01:28:35,178
I'll see you after.
Go on ahead.

1577
01:28:49,574 --> 01:28:50,564
What are you doing?

1578
01:28:50,659 --> 01:28:51,820
-(Thor screams)
-(Shrieks)

1579
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:53,412
-(Gasps)
"Frigga: Oh, god!

1580
01:28:53,578 --> 01:28:56,036
You're better off leaving
the sneaking to your brother.

1581
01:28:56,164 --> 01:28:58,030
No, I wasn't sneaking.
I was just going for a walk.

1582
01:28:58,208 --> 01:28:59,539
What are you wearing?

1583
01:28:59,710 --> 01:29:02,077
I always wear this.
It's one of my favorites.

1584
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:03,160
(Clears throat)

1585
01:29:05,048 --> 01:29:06,083
Thor: Mm...

1586
01:29:06,174 --> 01:29:07,551
What's wrong with your eye?

1587
01:29:07,718 --> 01:29:08,708
Oh, my eye.

1588
01:29:08,885 --> 01:29:10,842
Remember the, uh,
battle of harokin...

1589
01:29:11,013 --> 01:29:12,253
When I got hit in the face

1590
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:14,088
with the broadsword?
(Chuckles)

1591
01:29:17,602 --> 01:29:19,639
You're not the Thor
I Know at all, are you?

1592
01:29:20,397 --> 01:29:22,138
Yes, I am.

1593
01:29:22,649 --> 01:29:25,141
The future hasn't been kind
to you, has it?

1594
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:27,521
I didn't say
I was from the future.

1595
01:29:27,988 --> 01:29:30,525
I was raised by witches, boy.

1596
01:29:31,575 --> 01:29:33,942
I see with more than eyes,
you know that.

1597
01:29:36,038 --> 01:29:38,279
(Voice breaking) Yeah,
I'm totally from the future.

1598
01:29:38,457 --> 01:29:40,073
Yes, you are, honey.

1599
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:41,752
I really need to talk to you.

1600
01:29:41,918 --> 01:29:42,908
We can talk.

1601
01:29:48,133 --> 01:29:49,794
(Birds chirping)

1602
01:30:07,069 --> 01:30:09,026
His head was over there...

1603
01:30:09,654 --> 01:30:12,146
And his body over there...

1604
01:30:13,158 --> 01:30:15,946
(Scoffs) I mean, what was
the point? I was too late.

1605
01:30:16,620 --> 01:30:18,236
I was just standing there.

1606
01:30:19,206 --> 01:30:20,947
Some idiot with an axe.

1607
01:30:21,124 --> 01:30:22,831
Frigga: Now, you're no idiot.

1608
01:30:23,960 --> 01:30:25,542
You're here, aren't you?

1609
01:30:25,754 --> 01:30:28,212
Seeking counsel from
the wisest person in asgard.

1610
01:30:28,548 --> 01:30:29,583
I am. Yes.

1611
01:30:29,758 --> 01:30:31,089
Frigga: Idiot, no.

1612
01:30:31,259 --> 01:30:32,761
A failure?

1613
01:30:32,928 --> 01:30:34,043
Absolutely.

1614
01:30:34,221 --> 01:30:36,007
That's a little bit harsh.

1615
01:30:36,181 --> 01:30:37,671
Do you know
what that makes you?

1616
01:30:38,892 --> 01:30:40,883
Just like everyone else.

1617
01:30:41,061 --> 01:30:43,143
I'm not supposed to be
like everyone else, am I?

1618
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:44,345
Frigga: Mm.

1619
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:47,602
Everyone fails at who
they're supposed to be, Thor.

1620
01:30:48,318 --> 01:30:51,356
The measure of a person,
of a hero...

1621
01:30:51,530 --> 01:30:54,898
Is how Well they succeed
at being who they are.

1622
01:31:00,163 --> 01:31:01,619
I've really missed you, mom.

1623
01:31:07,504 --> 01:31:09,245
Thor! I got it!

1624
01:31:10,132 --> 01:31:11,668
Asgardian guard:
Get that rabbit!

1625
01:31:14,678 --> 01:31:16,260
Mom, I have to tell you
something.

1626
01:31:16,429 --> 01:31:18,215
No, son, you don't.

1627
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:20,882
You're here to repair
your future, not mine.

1628
01:31:21,059 --> 01:31:22,720
This is about your future.

1629
01:31:22,811 --> 01:31:24,222
Uh, it's none of my business.

1630
01:31:25,063 --> 01:31:26,349
-(Loud thud)
(Rocket panting)

1631
01:31:28,233 --> 01:31:29,473
Hi.

1632
01:31:29,651 --> 01:31:31,642
You must be mom.

1633
01:31:31,820 --> 01:31:33,276
I got the thing.
Come on. We gotta move.

1634
01:31:33,446 --> 01:31:34,902
Oh, I wish we had more time.

1635
01:31:35,073 --> 01:31:36,905
No, this was a gift.

1636
01:31:37,075 --> 01:31:40,488
Now you go and be the man
you're meant to be.

1637
01:31:40,954 --> 01:31:43,116
-I love you, mom.
-I love you.

1638
01:31:47,586 --> 01:31:49,497
And eat a salad.

1639
01:31:50,505 --> 01:31:51,620
Come on, we gotta go.

1640
01:31:51,798 --> 01:31:53,380
-Goodbye.
-Rocket: Three...

1641
01:31:53,550 --> 01:31:54,631
-Two...
-No, wait!

1642
01:31:57,888 --> 01:31:59,094
What am I looking at?

1643
01:31:59,264 --> 01:32:00,720
Oh, sometimes
it takes a second.

1644
01:32:03,518 --> 01:32:04,508
(Grunts)

1645
01:32:05,103 --> 01:32:06,514
(Laughs)

1646
01:32:10,192 --> 01:32:12,229
(Panting) I'm still worthy.

1647
01:32:13,653 --> 01:32:15,269
Oh, boy.

1648
01:32:16,448 --> 01:32:18,359
-Goodbye, mom.
-(Mouths) Goodbye.

1649
01:32:20,327 --> 01:32:22,568
("70s funk rock song playing)

1653
01:32:57,614 --> 01:32:59,230
So, he's an idiot?

1654
01:33:00,575 --> 01:33:01,986
Yeah.

1655
01:33:10,502 --> 01:33:11,708
Rhodes: What's that?

1656
01:33:11,878 --> 01:33:13,744
The tool of a thief.

1657
01:33:21,596 --> 01:33:22,677
Rhodes: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1658
01:33:23,515 --> 01:33:25,131
This is the part
where spikes come out...

1659
01:33:25,308 --> 01:33:26,810
With skeletons on the end
of them and everything.

1660
01:33:26,893 --> 01:33:28,099
What are you talking about?

1661
01:33:28,270 --> 01:33:29,305
When you break into
a place called

1662
01:33:29,396 --> 01:33:30,602
"the temple
of the power stone"...

1663
01:33:30,772 --> 01:33:32,058
There's gonna be
a bunch of booby traps.

1664
01:33:32,232 --> 01:33:34,473
-Oh, my god.
-Okay. All right. Go ahead.

(Blows)

1666
01:34:07,767 --> 01:34:09,269
I wasn't always like this.

1667
01:34:10,186 --> 01:34:11,176
Me either.

1668
01:34:12,981 --> 01:34:14,437
But we work
with what we got, right?

1669
01:34:16,151 --> 01:34:17,232
Hmm.

1670
01:34:18,194 --> 01:34:19,855
Let's sync up.

1671
01:34:21,740 --> 01:34:24,198
Three, two, one.

Natasha:
Where are the stones?

1679
01:34:43,636 --> 01:34:44,626
Gone.

1680
01:34:45,388 --> 01:34:46,378
Reduced to atoms.

1681

Banner: You used them
two days ago!

1682
01:34:49,059 --> 01:34:52,051
I used the stones
to destroy the stones.

1683
01:34:52,228 --> 01:34:54,060
It nearly killed me.

1684
01:34:54,230 --> 01:34:56,141
But the work is done.

1685
01:34:56,316 --> 01:34:58,148
It always will be.

1686
01:34:59,444 --> 01:35:02,903
I am inevitable.

1687
01:35:04,157 --> 01:35:06,194
What did you do to them?

1688
01:35:06,368 --> 01:35:07,608
Nothing.

1689
01:35:08,495 --> 01:35:09,781
Yet.

1690
01:35:11,581 --> 01:35:13,492
They're not trying
to stop something

1691
01:35:13,583 --> 01:35:15,290
I'm going to do in our time.

1692
01:35:15,627 --> 01:35:17,618
They're trying
to undo something

1693
01:35:17,712 --> 01:35:19,248
I've already done in theirs.

1694
01:35:19,422 --> 01:35:21,083
The stones.

1695
01:35:22,008 --> 01:35:23,919
I found them all.

1696
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:27,097
I won.

1697
01:35:27,847 --> 01:35:30,805
Tipped the cosmic scales
to balance.

1698
01:35:34,813 --> 01:35:36,554
This is your future.

1699
01:35:36,898 --> 01:35:38,935
It's my destiny.

My father is many things.

A liar is not one of them.

01:35:45,865 --> 01:35:46,855
Ah.

1703
01:35:47,909 --> 01:35:49,820
Thank you, daughter.

1704
01:35:49,994 --> 01:35:52,156
Perhaps I treated you
too harshly.

(Thor grunts)

1706

...is a traitor.

1712
01:36:07,762 --> 01:36:10,220
That's not me.
It's not, I could never...

1713
01:36:10,390 --> 01:36:11,551
I would never betray you.

1714
01:36:11,724 --> 01:36:13,556
Never. Never.

1715
01:36:19,315 --> 01:36:20,476
Thanos: I Know.

1716
01:36:21,443 --> 01:36:24,686
And you'll have the chance
to prove it.

(Moans)

1718
01:36:30,994 --> 01:36:32,075
No!

1719
01:36:32,787 --> 01:36:33,993
He knows!

1720
01:36:38,585 --> 01:36:40,622
Barton! Barton, come in.

1721
01:36:41,254 --> 01:36:42,540
Romanoff!

1722
01:36:43,173 --> 01:36:44,584
Come in, we have a problem.

1723
01:36:44,757 --> 01:36:45,883
Come on!

1724
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:47,461
Come in, we have a...

1725
01:36:47,635 --> 01:36:48,966
Thanos knows.

1726
01:36:49,637 --> 01:36:50,889
Thanos...

1727
01:37:04,611 --> 01:37:05,692
Tony: Cap.

1728
01:37:07,322 --> 01:37:09,563
Sorry, buddy,
we got a problem.

1729
01:37:09,699 --> 01:37:11,736
(Scoffs) Yeah, we do.

1730
01:37:12,327 --> 01:37:13,408
Steve: Well,
what are we gonna do now?

1731
01:37:13,495 --> 01:37:14,576
Tony: You know what?
Give me a break, Steve.

1732
01:37:14,662 --> 01:37:16,039
I just got hit in the head
with the hulk.

1733
01:37:16,122 --> 01:37:17,658
(Scoffs) You said
that we had one shot.

1734
01:37:17,832 --> 01:37:19,163
This was our shot.

1735
01:37:19,334 --> 01:37:21,325
We shot it. It's shot.
Six stones or nothing.

1736
01:37:21,503 --> 01:37:22,959
-It was six stones or nothing.
-You're repeating yourself,

1737
01:37:23,046 --> 01:37:24,036
you know that?
You're repeating yourself.

1738
01:37:24,214 --> 01:37:25,875
You're repeating yourself.
You're repeating yourself.

1739
01:37:25,965 --> 01:37:26,955
Dude. Come on!

1740
01:37:27,050 --> 01:37:28,040
No. You never wanted
a time heist.

1741
01:37:28,134 --> 01:37:29,124
You weren't on board
with the time heist.

1742
01:37:29,219 --> 01:37:30,425
- I dropped the ball.
-You ruined the time heist.

1743
01:37:30,512 --> 01:37:31,877
Tony: Is that what I did?
Scott: Yeah.

1744
01:37:31,971 --> 01:37:33,757
Are there any other options
with the tesseract?

1745
01:37:33,932 --> 01:37:35,138
No, no, no,
there's no other options.

1746
01:37:35,308 --> 01:37:36,548
There's no do-overs.

1747
01:37:36,726 --> 01:37:38,763
We're not going anywhere else.
We have one particle left.

1748
01:37:38,853 --> 01:37:39,843
Each.

1749
01:37:39,979 --> 01:37:42,266
That's it. All right?
We use that...

1750
01:37:42,440 --> 01:37:43,601
Bye-bye,
you're not going home.

1751
01:37:43,775 --> 01:37:45,732
Yeah, Well, if we don't try...

1752
01:37:45,902 --> 01:37:47,063
Then no one else
is going home, either.

1753
01:37:47,237 --> 01:37:48,227
I got it.

1754
01:37:49,447 --> 01:37:51,688
There's another way
to retake the tesseract

1755
01:37:51,783 --> 01:37:53,490
and acquire new particles.

1756
01:37:54,327 --> 01:37:55,362
Little stroll down
memory Lane.

1757
01:37:56,162 --> 01:37:57,994
Military installation,
garden state.

1758
01:38:02,085 --> 01:38:03,371
When were they both there?

1759
01:38:03,545 --> 01:38:05,912
They were there at a time...
I have a vaguely exact idea.

1760
01:38:06,589 --> 01:38:07,579
-How vague?
-Scott: What are you

1761
01:38:07,674 --> 01:38:08,709
talking about?
Where are we going?

1762
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:09,790
Tony: I Know for a fact
they were there.

1763
01:38:09,884 --> 01:38:10,874
Who's they? What are we doing?

1764
01:38:10,969 --> 01:38:12,050
And I Know how I Know.

1765
01:38:13,972 --> 01:38:15,508
Scott: Guys, what is it?

1766
01:38:16,099 --> 01:38:17,715
Looks like we're improvising.

1767
01:38:17,892 --> 01:38:19,098
-Great.
-What are we improvising?

1768
01:38:19,185 --> 01:38:20,926
Scott, get this back
to the compound.

1769
01:38:21,104 --> 01:38:22,094
Tony: Suit up.

1770
01:38:22,355 --> 01:38:23,766
-What's in New Jersey?
-Tony: 0-4.

1771
01:38:23,856 --> 01:38:24,846
0-4.

1772
01:38:24,983 --> 01:38:26,064
-Tony: Uh, 0-7.
-0-7.

1773
01:38:26,150 --> 01:38:28,016
-Excuse me.
-1-9-7-0.

1774
01:38:28,486 --> 01:38:29,476
Are you sure?

1775
01:38:29,571 --> 01:38:30,857
Scott: Cap? Captain?

1776
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:32,862
Steve? Sorry.

1777
01:38:33,032 --> 01:38:34,648
America. Rogers.

1778
01:38:34,826 --> 01:38:36,032
Look, if you do this...

1779
01:38:36,327 --> 01:38:38,864
And it doesn't work,
you're not coming back.

1780
01:38:39,956 --> 01:38:41,742
Thanks for the pep talk,
pissant.

1781
01:38:42,792 --> 01:38:43,998
You trust me?

1782
01:38:44,877 --> 01:38:46,038
I do.

1783
01:38:47,088 --> 01:38:48,419
Your call.

1784
01:38:49,299 --> 01:38:51,006
Here we go.

1785
01:38:56,014 --> 01:38:57,630
("70s rock song playing)

1786
01:39:07,066 --> 01:39:10,684
Hey, man!
Make love, not war.

1787
01:39:16,618 --> 01:39:19,280
Tony: Clearly you weren't
actually born here, right?

1788
01:39:19,454 --> 01:39:20,944
Steve: The idea of me was.

1789
01:39:22,123 --> 01:39:23,659
Tony: Right. Well,
imagine you're S.H.I.E.L.D...

1790
01:39:23,833 --> 01:39:27,076
Running a quasi-fascistic
intelligence organization...

1791
01:39:28,421 --> 01:39:30,003
Where do you hide it?

1792
01:39:30,173 --> 01:39:31,834
In plain sight.

1793
01:39:40,058 --> 01:39:41,139
(Visor trills)

1794
01:39:57,367 --> 01:39:58,482
(Elevator bell dings)

1795
01:40:00,244 --> 01:40:01,370
Good luck
on your mission, captain.

1796
01:40:01,537 --> 01:40:04,074
Good luck
on your project, doctor.

1797
01:40:07,502 --> 01:40:08,583
You new here?

1798
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:12,461
Not exactly.

1799
01:40:19,180 --> 01:40:20,966
Come on, you bastard.

1800
01:40:27,772 --> 01:40:29,262
Gotcha.

1801
01:40:34,153 --> 01:40:35,143
Whew.

1802
01:40:45,206 --> 01:40:46,412
(Sighs)

1803
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:48,452
Back in the game.

1804
01:40:51,129 --> 01:40:52,335
Howard: Arnim, you in there?

1805
01:40:53,297 --> 01:40:54,332
Arnim?

1806
01:40:59,637 --> 01:41:00,968
Hey!

1807
01:41:01,639 --> 01:41:03,346
The door is this way, pal.

1808
01:41:04,183 --> 01:41:05,218
Oh, yeah.

1809
01:41:05,393 --> 01:41:07,259
Looking for doctor zola,
have you seen him?

1810
01:41:07,437 --> 01:41:10,850
Yeah, doctor zola.
No, I haven't seen a soul.

1811
01:41:12,358 --> 01:41:13,689
Pardon me.

1812
01:41:14,444 --> 01:41:16,060
Do I Know you?

1813
01:41:17,321 --> 01:41:18,311
No, sir. Uh...

1814
01:41:19,782 --> 01:41:21,568
I'm a visitor from mit.

1815
01:41:22,160 --> 01:41:23,275
Oh. Mit.

1816
01:41:23,745 --> 01:41:24,860
Got a name?

1817
01:41:25,329 --> 01:41:26,455
Howard.

1818
01:41:26,622 --> 01:41:29,114
-That'll be easy to remember.
-Howard...

1819
01:41:30,126 --> 01:41:31,116
Potts.

1820
01:41:31,711 --> 01:41:33,918
Well, I'm Howard stark.

1821
01:41:34,088 --> 01:41:35,078
Hi.

1822
01:41:35,173 --> 01:41:36,459
Shake that, don't pull it.

1823
01:41:36,632 --> 01:41:37,622
Yeah.

1824
01:41:39,051 --> 01:41:41,258
You look a little green around
the gills, there, potts.

1825
01:41:41,429 --> 01:41:43,591
I'm fine. Just long hours.

1826
01:41:43,765 --> 01:41:45,472
You wanna get some air?

1827
01:41:48,019 --> 01:41:49,805
-Hello, potts.
-Yeah.

1828
01:41:49,979 --> 01:41:51,219
-That'd be swell.
-That way.

1829
01:41:51,397 --> 01:41:52,387
Okay.

1830
01:41:52,523 --> 01:41:54,184
Need your briefcase?

1831
01:41:56,778 --> 01:41:58,018
(Chuckles)

1832
01:41:58,529 --> 01:42:01,112
You're not one of those
beatniks, are you, potts?

1833
01:42:03,618 --> 01:42:05,154
(Telephone ringing)

1834
01:42:06,954 --> 01:42:08,740
Hank pym: Hello?
Steve: (On phone) Doctor pym?

1835
01:42:08,915 --> 01:42:11,122
Hank pym: That would be the
number that you called, yes.

1836
01:42:11,292 --> 01:42:13,533
This is captain Stevens
from shipping.

1837
01:42:13,711 --> 01:42:14,826
We have a package for you.

1838
01:42:14,921 --> 01:42:16,377
Oh, bring it up.

1839
01:42:16,547 --> 01:42:18,504
That's the thing, sir,
we can't.

1840
01:42:19,634 --> 01:42:22,251
I'm confused.
I thought that was your job.

1841
01:42:22,428 --> 01:42:23,805
Well, it's just...

1842
01:42:23,971 --> 01:42:25,427
Sir, the box is glowing...

1843
01:42:25,598 --> 01:42:26,588
And to be honest,

1844
01:42:26,682 --> 01:42:28,389
some of our mail guys
aren't feeling that great.

1845
01:42:28,559 --> 01:42:30,266
They didn't open it, did they?

1846
01:42:30,436 --> 01:42:32,598
Uh, yeah, they did.
You better get down here.

1847
01:42:33,439 --> 01:42:35,350
Excuse me!
Out of the way!

1848
01:43:02,552 --> 01:43:06,045
So, flowers and Sauerkraut.
You got a big date tonight?

1849
01:43:06,806 --> 01:43:08,262
Uh, my wife's expecting.

1850
01:43:08,432 --> 01:43:11,265
And too much time
at the office.

1851
01:43:13,104 --> 01:43:14,469
Congratulations.

1852
01:43:14,647 --> 01:43:16,763
-Thanks. Hold this, will ya?
-Yeah, sure.

1853
01:43:17,859 --> 01:43:19,941
-How far along is she?
-Uh, I Don't know.

1854
01:43:21,737 --> 01:43:22,863
She's at the point where

1855
01:43:22,947 --> 01:43:24,483
she can't stand
the sound of my chewing.

1856
01:43:24,657 --> 01:43:28,116
I guess I'll be eating dinner
in the pantry again.

1857
01:43:29,036 --> 01:43:30,026
I have a little girl.

1858
01:43:30,204 --> 01:43:31,706
A girl would be nice.

1859
01:43:31,873 --> 01:43:33,864
Less of a chance she'd
turn out exactly like me.

1860
01:43:34,542 --> 01:43:35,998
What'd be So awful about that?

1861
01:43:36,168 --> 01:43:38,159
Let's just say
that the greater good

1862
01:43:38,254 --> 01:43:41,542
has rarely outweighed
my own self-interest.

1863
01:43:45,595 --> 01:43:46,756
Guard: And you've never seen
these two men before?

1864
01:43:46,846 --> 01:43:48,632
No, I've got an eye for this.
The two of them looked fishy.

1865
01:43:48,806 --> 01:43:49,796
Can you describe them?

1866
01:43:49,891 --> 01:43:51,052
One of them
had a hippie beard.

1867
01:43:51,225 --> 01:43:53,387
Guard: Hippie.
Like Bee Gees or mungo Jerry?

1868
01:43:53,561 --> 01:43:54,596
Female agent:
Definitely mungo Jerry.

1869
01:43:54,770 --> 01:43:55,760
Yeah, this is chesler.

1870
01:43:55,855 --> 01:43:57,016
I need every available mp
to sublevel six.

1871
01:43:57,106 --> 01:43:58,972
We have a potential breach.

1872
01:44:16,876 --> 01:44:17,866
Peggy: I said bring them in.

1873
01:44:18,002 --> 01:44:19,037
They're trying, ma'am,
but braddock's unit

1874
01:44:19,128 --> 01:44:20,118
has been stopped
by lightning strikes.

1875
01:44:20,212 --> 01:44:21,247
Oh, for the love of...

1876
01:44:21,339 --> 01:44:22,829
I'll look at
the weather projections.

1877
01:44:24,216 --> 01:44:25,206
(Indistinct)

1878
01:44:46,864 --> 01:44:48,855
It's not lightning strikes
we're looking at.

1879
01:45:00,211 --> 01:45:01,918
Tony: So, where you at
with names?

1880
01:45:02,088 --> 01:45:05,206
Howard: Well, if it's a boy,
my wife likes elmonzo.

1881
01:45:05,383 --> 01:45:07,340
Tony: Huh. Might wanna
let that stew awhile.

1882
01:45:07,426 --> 01:45:08,882
-You got time.
-Uh-huh.

1883
01:45:10,262 --> 01:45:11,764
Let me ask you a question.

1884
01:45:12,765 --> 01:45:16,008
When your kid was born,
were you nervous?

1885
01:45:16,185 --> 01:45:17,687
-Wildly.
-(Sighs)

1886
01:45:17,770 --> 01:45:19,477
-Yeah.
-Did you feel qualified?

1887
01:45:19,647 --> 01:45:21,513
Like you had any idea

1888
01:45:21,607 --> 01:45:23,223
how to successfully operate
that thing?

1889
01:45:23,651 --> 01:45:26,484
I literally pieced it together
as I went along.

1890
01:45:26,654 --> 01:45:28,645
I thought about
what my dad did.

1891
01:45:29,115 --> 01:45:30,355
Howard: (Sighs) My old man,

1892
01:45:30,449 --> 01:45:32,235
he never met a problem
he couldn't solve with a belt.

1893
01:45:32,326 --> 01:45:34,363
I thought my dad
was tough on me.

1894
01:45:34,537 --> 01:45:35,868
And now, looking back on it,

1895
01:45:35,955 --> 01:45:37,241
I just remember
the good stuff.

1896
01:45:37,415 --> 01:45:38,997
You know?
He did drop the odd Pearl.

1897
01:45:39,166 --> 01:45:40,543
Yeah? Like what?

1898
01:45:41,669 --> 01:45:44,161
"No amount of money
ever bought a second of time."

1899
01:45:45,506 --> 01:45:46,541
Smart guy.

1900
01:45:46,966 --> 01:45:48,422
He did his best.

1901
01:45:49,802 --> 01:45:51,292
I'll tell you,
that kid's not even here yet

1902
01:45:51,387 --> 01:45:53,754
and there's nothing
I wouldn't do for him.

1903
01:46:02,523 --> 01:46:03,888
Good to meet you, potts.

1904
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:05,390
Yeah.

1905
01:46:05,818 --> 01:46:06,979
Howard...

1906
01:46:07,570 --> 01:46:09,152
Everything's gonna be
all right.

1907
01:46:12,158 --> 01:46:13,398
Thank you...

1908
01:46:14,368 --> 01:46:15,699
For everything...

1909
01:46:16,120 --> 01:46:18,407
You've done for this country.

1910
01:46:21,292 --> 01:46:22,407
Howard: Jarvis.

1911
01:46:26,130 --> 01:46:27,666
Have we ever met that guy?

1912
01:46:29,675 --> 01:46:31,177
You meet a lot of people, sir.

1913
01:46:33,804 --> 01:46:35,420
Seems very familiar.

1914
01:46:36,348 --> 01:46:37,804
Weird beard.

1915
01:46:43,898 --> 01:46:45,059
(Grunts)

1916
01:46:45,775 --> 01:46:47,140
(Panting) You're weak.

1917
01:46:47,693 --> 01:46:48,774
I'm you.

1918
01:46:49,487 --> 01:46:50,477
(Groans)

1919
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:54,355
(Gasps)

1920
01:47:06,420 --> 01:47:08,502
Nebula: You could stop this.

1921
01:47:08,798 --> 01:47:10,584
You know you want to.

1922
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:13,462
Did you see
what happens in the future?

1923
01:47:14,762 --> 01:47:17,129
Thanos finds the soul stone.

1924
01:47:18,682 --> 01:47:20,673
You wanna know
how he does that?

1925
01:47:22,061 --> 01:47:26,225
You wanna know
what he does to you?

1926
01:47:26,732 --> 01:47:27,722
That's enough.

1927
01:47:28,234 --> 01:47:29,599
-(Grunts)
-(Nebula groans)

1928
01:47:35,157 --> 01:47:36,443
(Nebula chokes)

1929
01:47:40,412 --> 01:47:41,994
You disgust me.

1930
01:47:43,290 --> 01:47:48,160
But that doesn't mean
you're useless.

1931
01:48:09,859 --> 01:48:11,566
How do I look?

1932
01:48:18,159 --> 01:48:19,149
Wow.

1933
01:48:20,161 --> 01:48:23,279
Under different
circumstances...

1934
01:48:23,455 --> 01:48:25,446
This would be totally awesome.

1935
01:48:37,386 --> 01:48:38,751
Natasha: (Groans)
I bet the raccoon

1936
01:48:38,846 --> 01:48:40,428
didn't have to climb
a mountain.

1937
01:48:40,598 --> 01:48:42,509
Technically he's not
a raccoon, you know?

1938
01:48:42,600 --> 01:48:44,216
Oh, whatever.
He eats garbage.

1939
01:48:44,393 --> 01:48:45,724
Red skull: Welcome.

1940
01:48:48,898 --> 01:48:50,229
Natasha.

1941
01:48:50,399 --> 01:48:51,389
Daughter of Ivan.

1942
01:48:52,735 --> 01:48:53,850
Clint.

1943
01:48:54,028 --> 01:48:56,315
Son of Edith.

1944
01:49:01,702 --> 01:49:03,158
Who are you?

1945
01:49:03,787 --> 01:49:06,245
Consider me a guide...

1946
01:49:06,415 --> 01:49:08,076
To you...

1947
01:49:08,250 --> 01:49:10,082
And to all who seek
the soul stone.

1948
01:49:10,252 --> 01:49:11,287
Oh, good.

1949
01:49:11,462 --> 01:49:13,578
You tell us where it is,
then we'll be on our way.

1950
01:49:14,381 --> 01:49:15,997
(Speaks German)

1951
01:49:17,509 --> 01:49:19,762
If only it were that easy.

1952
01:49:31,857 --> 01:49:35,566
What you seek
lies in front of you.

1953
01:49:36,820 --> 01:49:39,232
As does what you fear.

1954
01:49:44,161 --> 01:49:46,027
The stone's down there.

1955
01:49:46,664 --> 01:49:48,575
Red skull: For one of you.

1956
01:49:48,874 --> 01:49:50,581
For the other...

1957
01:49:53,254 --> 01:49:55,165
In order to take the stone...

1958
01:49:55,339 --> 01:49:58,331
You must lose
that which you love.

1959
01:49:59,718 --> 01:50:02,881
An everlasting exchange.

1960
01:50:03,889 --> 01:50:07,974
A soul for a soul.

1961
01:50:10,562 --> 01:50:13,145
Barton: How's it going?
(Chuckles)

1962
01:50:15,359 --> 01:50:16,770
Jesus.

1963
01:50:17,111 --> 01:50:18,818
Maybe he's making
this shit up.

1964
01:50:19,697 --> 01:50:21,028
No.

1965
01:50:21,865 --> 01:50:22,855
I Don't think So.

1966
01:50:23,575 --> 01:50:25,737
Why? 'Cause he knows
your daddy's name?

1967
01:50:27,246 --> 01:50:28,281
I didn't.

1968
01:50:29,790 --> 01:50:32,157
Thanos left here
with the stone...

1969
01:50:32,835 --> 01:50:34,371
Without his daughter.

1970
01:50:34,545 --> 01:50:36,627
That's not a coincidence.

1971
01:50:37,715 --> 01:50:39,331
Yeah.

1972
01:50:41,051 --> 01:50:42,917
Whatever it takes.

1973
01:50:47,433 --> 01:50:48,923
Whatever it takes.

1974
01:50:53,314 --> 01:50:55,271
If we don't get that stone...

1975
01:50:55,441 --> 01:50:57,102
Billions of people stay dead.

1976
01:50:57,985 --> 01:50:59,146
Yeah.

1977
01:51:01,030 --> 01:51:03,146
Then I guess we both know
who it's gotta be.

1978
01:51:03,907 --> 01:51:05,068
I guess we do.

1979
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:15,616
I'm starting to think we mean

1980
01:51:15,711 --> 01:51:18,203
different people here,
Natasha.

1981
01:51:18,714 --> 01:51:20,546
For the last five years, I've
been trying to do one thing.

1982
01:51:20,716 --> 01:51:21,956
Get to right here.

1983
01:51:22,134 --> 01:51:24,125
That's all it's been about.
Bringing everybody back.

1984
01:51:24,303 --> 01:51:26,510
No, don't you get
all decent on me now.

1985
01:51:26,680 --> 01:51:28,671
What, you think I wanna do it?

1986
01:51:29,266 --> 01:51:31,007
I'm trying to save your life,
you idiot.

1987
01:51:31,185 --> 01:51:33,517
Yeah, Well, I Don't
want you to. How's that?

1988
01:51:34,438 --> 01:51:36,645
Natasha, you know
what I've done.

1989
01:51:38,317 --> 01:51:40,103
You know what I've become.

1990
01:51:42,237 --> 01:51:44,820
Oh, I Don't judge people
on their worst mistakes.

1991
01:51:48,994 --> 01:51:50,234
Maybe you should.

1992
01:51:51,121 --> 01:51:52,657
You didn't.

1993
01:51:58,837 --> 01:52:01,044
You're a pain in my ass,
you know that?

1994
01:52:12,142 --> 01:52:13,348
Okay.

1995
01:52:15,104 --> 01:52:16,594
You win.

1996
01:52:20,234 --> 01:52:21,724
(Grunting)

1997
01:52:23,070 --> 01:52:24,231
Tell my family I love 'em.

1998
01:52:25,406 --> 01:52:26,521
(Grunting)

1999
01:52:27,950 --> 01:52:29,156
You tell 'em yourself.

2000
01:52:29,410 --> 01:52:30,400
(Groans)

2001
01:52:37,709 --> 01:52:38,744
(Grunts)

2002
01:52:55,769 --> 01:52:57,146
(Both grunting)

2003
01:53:02,025 --> 01:53:03,015
Damn you.

2004
01:53:08,866 --> 01:53:09,856
(Grunts)

2005
01:53:10,534 --> 01:53:11,524
Wait.

2006
01:53:19,585 --> 01:53:21,417
Let me go.

2007
01:53:22,671 --> 01:53:23,661
No.

2008
01:53:25,424 --> 01:53:26,414
No. Please, no.

2009
01:53:29,803 --> 01:53:31,635
It's okay.

2010
01:53:33,682 --> 01:53:34,672
Please.

2011
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:37,758
No!

2012
01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:40,162
(Panting)

2013
01:54:53,637 --> 01:54:54,968
(Sobbing)

2014
01:55:19,246 --> 01:55:20,236
Did we get 'em all?

2015
01:55:21,665 --> 01:55:23,451
Are you telling me
this actually worked?

2016
01:55:28,297 --> 01:55:29,503
Clint, where's nat?

2017
01:55:36,513 --> 01:55:37,628
(Gasps softly)

2018
01:55:58,744 --> 01:55:59,734
Do we know if she had family?

2019
01:56:00,912 --> 01:56:02,073
Yeah.

2020
01:56:02,247 --> 01:56:03,237
Us.

2021
01:56:04,666 --> 01:56:05,701
What?

2022
01:56:06,585 --> 01:56:07,575
Huh?

2023
01:56:07,669 --> 01:56:08,909
-What are you doing?
-Just asked him a question.

2024
01:56:09,004 --> 01:56:10,244
Yeah, no, you're acting
like she's dead.

2025
01:56:10,422 --> 01:56:11,537
Why are we acting
like she's dead?

2026
01:56:11,632 --> 01:56:12,872
We have the stones, right?

2027
01:56:13,050 --> 01:56:14,040
As long as we have
the stones...

2028
01:56:14,217 --> 01:56:15,958
Cap, we can bring her back.
Isn't that right?

2029
01:56:16,136 --> 01:56:18,127
So, stop this shit. We're the
avengers. Get it together.

2030
01:56:18,305 --> 01:56:19,511
Can't get her back.

2031
01:56:22,517 --> 01:56:23,769
What's he...?
What?

2032
01:56:23,935 --> 01:56:25,141
It can't be undone.

2033
01:56:25,729 --> 01:56:27,436
It can't.

2034
01:56:28,106 --> 01:56:29,437
(Laughs)

2035
01:56:29,941 --> 01:56:31,318
Look, I'm sorry, no offense,

2036
01:56:31,401 --> 01:56:33,062
but you're a very
earthly being, okay?

2037
01:56:33,236 --> 01:56:34,522
And we're talking
about space magic.

2038
01:56:34,696 --> 01:56:36,687
And "can't" seems very
definitive. Don't you think?

2039
01:56:36,865 --> 01:56:38,230
Yeah, look,
I Know that I'm way outside

2040
01:56:38,325 --> 01:56:39,690
my pay grade here.

2041
01:56:39,868 --> 01:56:41,324
But she still
isn't here, is she?

2042
01:56:41,495 --> 01:56:42,485
Thor: No, that's my point.

2043
01:56:42,663 --> 01:56:45,621
It can't be undone.

2044
01:56:45,791 --> 01:56:47,202
Or that's at least

2045
01:56:47,292 --> 01:56:49,124
what the red,
floating guy had to say.

2046
01:56:49,294 --> 01:56:50,750
Maybe you wanna go
talk to him, okay?

2047
01:56:50,921 --> 01:56:53,959
Go grab your hammer and you
go fly and you talk to him.

2048
01:57:02,516 --> 01:57:04,553
It was supposed to be me.

2049
01:57:06,812 --> 01:57:09,099
She sacrificed her life
for that goddamn stone.

2050
01:57:09,272 --> 01:57:10,728
She bet her life on it.

2051
01:57:11,108 --> 01:57:12,314
(Grunts)

2052
01:57:15,654 --> 01:57:17,986
She's not coming back.

2053
01:57:19,783 --> 01:57:21,239
We have to make it worth it.

2054
01:57:21,827 --> 01:57:23,283
We have to.

2055
01:57:24,705 --> 01:57:26,366
We will.

2056
01:57:51,064 --> 01:57:52,179
Boom!

2057
01:57:52,899 --> 01:57:54,856
(Chuckles mischievously)

2058
01:57:57,863 --> 01:57:59,319
All right, the glove's ready.

2059
01:58:00,115 --> 01:58:02,698
Question is, who's gonna
snap their freakin' fingers?

2060
01:58:02,868 --> 01:58:04,950
-I'll do it.
-Tony: Excuse me?

2061
01:58:05,078 --> 01:58:06,113
Thor: It's okay.

2062
01:58:06,204 --> 01:58:07,194
Tony: Stop, stop. Slow down.

2063
01:58:07,289 --> 01:58:08,779
Thor. Just wait.

2064
01:58:08,957 --> 01:58:10,789
We haven't decided
who's gonna put that on yet.

2065
01:58:11,168 --> 01:58:12,750
I'm sorry. What,
we're all just sitting around

2066
01:58:12,836 --> 01:58:14,076
waiting for
the right opportunity?

2067
01:58:14,254 --> 01:58:15,369
We should at least discuss it.

2068
01:58:15,547 --> 01:58:17,504
Look, sitting here
staring at the thing

2069
01:58:17,591 --> 01:58:19,377
is not gonna bring
everybody back.

2070
01:58:20,427 --> 01:58:21,917
I'm the strongest avenger,
okay?

2071
01:58:22,012 --> 01:58:23,343
So, this responsibility
falls upon me.

2072
01:58:23,513 --> 01:58:24,719
-Normally, you're right.
-It's my duty.

2073
01:58:24,890 --> 01:58:26,676
-It's not about that.
-It's not that. (Shushes)

2074
01:58:26,850 --> 01:58:28,636
-Tony: Hey, buddy...
-Stop it! Just let me.

2075
01:58:31,646 --> 01:58:33,148
Just let me do it.

2076
01:58:33,315 --> 01:58:35,807
Just let me do something good.
Something right.

2077
01:58:35,984 --> 01:58:36,974
Look, it's not
just the fact...

2078
01:58:37,152 --> 01:58:38,267
That that glove is channeling
enough energy

2079
01:58:38,361 --> 01:58:39,271
to light up a continent.

2080
01:58:39,446 --> 01:58:41,437
I'm telling you.
You're in no condition.

2081
01:58:41,615 --> 01:58:44,653
What do you think is coursing
through my veins right now?

2082
01:58:44,826 --> 01:58:45,861
Cheez whiz?

2083
01:58:48,413 --> 01:58:49,403
Lightning.

2084
01:58:49,581 --> 01:58:50,696
-Yeah.
-Lightning.

2085
01:58:50,874 --> 01:58:52,239
Smart hulk:
Lightning won't help you, pal.

2086
01:58:52,417 --> 01:58:54,249
It's gotta be me.

2087
01:58:55,587 --> 01:58:57,749
You saw what those stones
did to thanos.

2088
01:58:57,923 --> 01:58:59,459
They almost killed him.

2089
01:59:00,884 --> 01:59:02,750
None of you could survive.

2090
01:59:03,470 --> 01:59:05,086
Steve: How do we know
you will?

2091
01:59:05,263 --> 01:59:06,298
Smart hulk: We don't.

2092
01:59:06,598 --> 01:59:09,135
But the radiation's
mostly gamma.

2093
01:59:12,646 --> 01:59:14,228
It's like...

2094
01:59:16,107 --> 01:59:18,018
I was made for this.

2095
01:59:36,962 --> 01:59:38,452
Good to go, yeah?

2096
01:59:40,590 --> 01:59:41,580
Let's do it.

2097
01:59:41,758 --> 01:59:43,123
Okay, remember,

2098
01:59:43,218 --> 01:59:44,800
everyone thanos snapped away
five years ago...

2099
01:59:44,970 --> 01:59:47,428
You're just bringing them
back to now, today.

2100
01:59:47,597 --> 01:59:49,008
Don't change anything
from the last five years.

2101
01:59:50,433 --> 01:59:51,594
Got it.

2102
02:00:07,993 --> 02:00:09,233
Iron man:
Friday, do me a favor

2103
02:00:09,327 --> 02:00:10,783
and activate
barn door protocol, will ya?

2104
02:00:10,954 --> 02:00:12,240
Friday: Yes, boss.

2105
02:00:20,839 --> 02:00:22,671
Everybody comes home.

2106
02:00:33,435 --> 02:00:35,722
(Groaning)

2107
02:00:46,072 --> 02:00:47,483
Take it off! Take it off!

2108
02:00:47,657 --> 02:00:48,772
No, wait.
Bruce, are you okay?

2109
02:00:48,867 --> 02:00:51,154
-(Continues groaning)
-Iron man: Talk to me, banner.

2110
02:00:54,331 --> 02:00:55,321
I'm okay.

2111
02:00:55,832 --> 02:00:57,118
I'm okay.

2112
02:01:14,643 --> 02:01:16,054
(Panting heavily)

2113
02:01:19,230 --> 02:01:20,812
(Yelling)

2114
02:01:25,028 --> 02:01:26,018
(Snaps)

2115
02:01:28,573 --> 02:01:29,688
Steve: Bruce!

2116
02:01:31,451 --> 02:01:33,033
Don't move him.

2117
02:01:35,080 --> 02:01:36,616
(Groaning)

2118
02:01:37,874 --> 02:01:39,831
(Doors opening)

2119
02:01:39,918 --> 02:01:41,909
-Did it work?
-We're not sure. It's okay.

2120
02:01:54,474 --> 02:01:56,090
(Cell phone vibrating)

2121
02:02:04,859 --> 02:02:06,190
(Birds chirping)

2122
02:02:21,626 --> 02:02:23,617
(Cell phone
continues vibrating)

2123
02:02:28,425 --> 02:02:29,290
Honey.

2124
02:02:29,467 --> 02:02:30,423
Laura: Clint?

2125
02:02:30,593 --> 02:02:31,845
Honey.

2126
02:02:32,679 --> 02:02:34,010
Guys...

2127
02:02:36,474 --> 02:02:37,851
I think it worked.

2128
02:02:53,241 --> 02:02:54,606
(War machine yelping)

2129
02:03:20,477 --> 02:03:22,343
I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!

2130
02:03:22,437 --> 02:03:23,518
-(Groans)
-(Rapid beeping)

2131
02:03:23,605 --> 02:03:25,391
Canopy, canopy, canopy.

2132
02:03:29,694 --> 02:03:31,276
(Grunting)

2133
02:03:32,030 --> 02:03:33,816
Rhodey, rocket,
get out of here.

2134
02:03:34,991 --> 02:03:36,527
Rocket: Let me up! Let me up!

2135
02:03:37,285 --> 02:03:38,036
Come on!

2136
02:03:40,455 --> 02:03:41,911
(Rhodes straining)

2137
02:03:45,335 --> 02:03:46,496
(Exhales)

2138
02:03:48,171 --> 02:03:49,002
Rhodey!

2139
02:03:50,799 --> 02:03:51,914
Rocket: Huh?

2140
02:03:57,555 --> 02:03:59,262
Rhodes: Mayday, mayday!
Does anybody copy?

2141
02:03:59,349 --> 02:04:00,589
We're on the lower level.
It's flooding!

2142
02:04:00,767 --> 02:04:02,474
Ant-man: What? What?

2143
02:04:02,644 --> 02:04:04,806
Rhodes: We are drowning!
Does anybody copy? Mayday!

2144
02:04:04,979 --> 02:04:07,141
Ant-man: Wait! I'm here!

2145
02:04:07,315 --> 02:04:08,817
I'm here. Can you hear me?

2146
02:04:11,361 --> 02:04:12,943
(Grunting)

2147
02:04:15,907 --> 02:04:16,942
(Groans)

2148
02:04:28,461 --> 02:04:29,667
Cap?

2149
02:04:39,931 --> 02:04:41,717
(Quiet growl)

2150
02:04:53,653 --> 02:04:54,768
Okay.

2151
02:04:58,199 --> 02:04:59,701
(Creatures snarling)

2152
02:05:14,048 --> 02:05:15,174
Daughter.

2153
02:05:15,341 --> 02:05:16,502
Yes, father.

2154
02:05:18,386 --> 02:05:20,093
So, this is the future.

2155
02:05:20,763 --> 02:05:21,594
Well done.

2156
02:05:22,515 --> 02:05:24,017
Thank you, father.

2157
02:05:24,184 --> 02:05:25,549
They suspected nothing.

2158
02:05:27,896 --> 02:05:29,352
The arrogant never do.

2159
02:05:32,317 --> 02:05:33,432
Go.

2160
02:05:34,402 --> 02:05:36,814
Find the stones,
bring them to me.

2161
02:05:36,988 --> 02:05:38,695
What will you do?

2162
02:05:40,033 --> 02:05:41,694
Wait.

2163
02:05:55,506 --> 02:05:56,792
(Whirring)

2164
02:06:06,935 --> 02:06:08,596
Tell me something.

2165
02:06:09,729 --> 02:06:12,141
In the future...

2166
02:06:12,315 --> 02:06:14,181
What happens to you and me?

2167
02:06:16,486 --> 02:06:18,102
I try to kill you.

2168
02:06:19,822 --> 02:06:21,324
Several times.

2169
02:06:22,408 --> 02:06:24,365
But eventually...

2170
02:06:24,535 --> 02:06:26,492
We become friends.

2171
02:06:27,997 --> 02:06:29,704
We become sisters.

2172
02:06:37,382 --> 02:06:38,588
Gamora: Come on.

2173
02:06:40,635 --> 02:06:42,421
We can stop him.

2174
02:06:50,520 --> 02:06:51,851
Tony: Come on, buddy,
wake up!

2175
02:06:51,938 --> 02:06:53,849
-(Gasping)
-That's my man.

2176
02:06:54,774 --> 02:06:56,811
You lose this again,
I'm keeping it.

2177
02:07:00,363 --> 02:07:01,524
What happened?

2178
02:07:01,698 --> 02:07:03,814
You mess with time,
it tends to mess back.

2179
02:07:03,992 --> 02:07:04,857
You'll see.

2180
02:07:05,743 --> 02:07:06,733
(Grunts)

2181
02:07:26,973 --> 02:07:28,338
What's he been doing?

2182
02:07:30,268 --> 02:07:31,679
Absolutely nothing.

2183
02:07:33,438 --> 02:07:35,304
Steve: Where are the stones?

2184
02:07:35,690 --> 02:07:37,522
Somewhere under all this.

2185
02:07:38,901 --> 02:07:41,108
All I Know is
he doesn't have 'em.

2186
02:07:41,279 --> 02:07:43,020
So, we keep it that way.

2187
02:07:43,197 --> 02:07:44,574
You know it's a trap, right?

2188
02:07:44,741 --> 02:07:46,072
Yeah.

2189
02:07:46,242 --> 02:07:47,573
I Don't much care.

2190
02:07:48,328 --> 02:07:49,318
Good.

2191
02:07:50,288 --> 02:07:52,780
Just as long
as we're all in agreement.

2192
02:07:52,874 --> 02:07:54,740
(Thunder cracking)

2193
02:08:02,550 --> 02:08:04,541
Let's kill him
properly this time.

2194
02:08:13,936 --> 02:08:16,849
You could not live
with your own failure.

2195
02:08:18,358 --> 02:08:20,190
Where did that bring you?

2196
02:08:23,154 --> 02:08:25,020
Back to me.

2197
02:08:28,451 --> 02:08:31,284
I thought by eliminating
half of life...

2198
02:08:32,038 --> 02:08:34,405
The other half would thrive.

2199
02:08:34,582 --> 02:08:35,913
But you've shown me...

2200
02:08:37,085 --> 02:08:38,826
That's impossible.

2201
02:08:40,755 --> 02:08:44,043
And as long as there are those
that remember what was...

2202
02:08:44,217 --> 02:08:45,707
There will always be those

2203
02:08:45,802 --> 02:08:49,420
that are unable to accept
what can be.

2204
02:08:50,181 --> 02:08:51,421
They will resist.

2205
02:08:51,933 --> 02:08:53,844
Yep, we're all kinds
of stubborn.

2206
02:08:54,769 --> 02:08:56,351
I'm thankful.

2207
02:08:58,523 --> 02:09:00,264
Because now...

2208
02:09:00,441 --> 02:09:02,557
I Know what I must do.

2209
02:09:03,027 --> 02:09:05,985
I will shred this universe...

2210
02:09:06,155 --> 02:09:08,192
Down to its last atom.

2211
02:09:08,991 --> 02:09:10,652
And then...

2212
02:09:10,827 --> 02:09:13,159
With the stones
you've collected for me...

2213
02:09:13,955 --> 02:09:16,071
Create a new one...

2214
02:09:16,249 --> 02:09:18,456
Teeming with life...

2215
02:09:18,626 --> 02:09:20,492
That knows not
what it has lost...

2216
02:09:20,670 --> 02:09:23,037
But only
what it has been given.

2217
02:09:26,134 --> 02:09:27,545
A grateful universe.

2218
02:09:28,094 --> 02:09:29,505
Born out of blood.

2219
02:09:29,679 --> 02:09:31,340
They'll never know it.

2220
02:09:32,557 --> 02:09:35,470
Because you won't be alive
to tell them.

2221
02:09:36,853 --> 02:09:37,968
(Yelling)

2222
02:09:48,072 --> 02:09:49,278
(Grunting)

2223
02:09:50,074 --> 02:09:51,360
See you
on the other side, man.

2224
02:09:51,451 --> 02:09:52,816
(Rocket whimpering)

2225
02:09:53,703 --> 02:09:55,694
Ant-man: Hang on! I'm coming!

2226
02:09:56,164 --> 02:09:57,325
(Grunting)

2227
02:10:04,255 --> 02:10:05,416
(Creatures snarling)

2228
02:10:10,303 --> 02:10:11,634
(Beeping)

2229
02:10:14,932 --> 02:10:16,093
(Grunts)

2230
02:10:16,559 --> 02:10:17,799
(Growling)

2231
02:10:25,985 --> 02:10:26,975
Yeah!

2232
02:10:31,199 --> 02:10:32,314
(Yells)

2233
02:10:34,243 --> 02:10:35,324
(Grunts)

2234
02:10:36,454 --> 02:10:38,240
(Panting)

2235
02:10:41,876 --> 02:10:43,412
Oh, hey.

2236
02:10:43,586 --> 02:10:45,293
I Know you.

2237
02:10:48,216 --> 02:10:49,206
Father...

2238
02:10:49,967 --> 02:10:51,378
I have the stones.

2239
02:10:51,552 --> 02:10:52,462
What?

2240
02:10:53,846 --> 02:10:54,756
Gamora: Stop.

2241
02:10:59,977 --> 02:11:01,388
You're betraying us?

2242
02:11:07,401 --> 02:11:08,687
You don't have to do this.

2243
02:11:11,531 --> 02:11:14,023
I am this.

2244
02:11:14,200 --> 02:11:16,111
No, you're not.

2245
02:11:16,577 --> 02:11:18,443
You've seen what we become.

2246
02:11:24,544 --> 02:11:26,751
Nebula, listen to her.

2247
02:11:28,214 --> 02:11:29,079
You can change.

2248
02:11:35,763 --> 02:11:37,265
He won't let me.

2249
02:11:38,891 --> 02:11:39,642
No!

2250
02:11:40,893 --> 02:11:42,099
(Groans)

2251
02:11:59,287 --> 02:12:00,652
Okay, Thor. Hit me.

2252
02:12:01,497 --> 02:12:02,999
(Yelling)

2253
02:12:07,044 --> 02:12:08,250
(Grunts)

2254
02:12:17,305 --> 02:12:18,591
Friday: Boss, wake up!

2255
02:12:26,814 --> 02:12:27,975
(Thor grunts)

2256
02:12:31,694 --> 02:12:33,435
(Both grunting)

2257
02:12:52,381 --> 02:12:53,633
(Grunts)

2258
02:13:09,899 --> 02:13:11,185
I knew it!

2259
02:13:20,910 --> 02:13:21,900
(Grunts)

2260
02:13:26,290 --> 02:13:27,280
(Thanos groaning)

2261
02:13:29,043 --> 02:13:30,329
(Grunts)

2262
02:13:34,340 --> 02:13:35,330
(Grunting)

2263
02:13:39,804 --> 02:13:40,794
(Grunts)

2264
02:13:48,062 --> 02:13:48,893
(Panting)

2265
02:13:50,147 --> 02:13:51,308
(Thanos yells)

2266
02:14:08,541 --> 02:14:10,202
(Breathing heavily)

2267
02:14:26,058 --> 02:14:29,050
(Straining)

2268
02:14:33,566 --> 02:14:36,399
In all my years of conquest...

2269
02:14:37,695 --> 02:14:39,436
Violence...

2270
02:14:40,489 --> 02:14:42,446
Slaughter...

2271
02:14:43,576 --> 02:14:45,988
It was never personal.

2272
02:14:48,581 --> 02:14:50,663
But I'll tell you now...

2273

02:14:56,547 --> 02:14:58,914
annoying little planet...

2275
02:15:00,676 --> 02:15:02,883
I'm gonna enjoy it...

2276
02:15:03,804 --> 02:15:06,182
Very, very much.

2277

Sam: (On speakers)
Hey, cap, you read me?

2282
02:16:17,211 --> 02:16:19,498
Cap, it's Sam.
Can you hear me?

2283
02:16:23,509 --> 02:16:24,920
On your left.

2284
02:17:19,273 --> 02:17:21,685
(All chanting in xhosa)

2285
02:17:50,596 --> 02:17:51,882
Is that everyone?

2286
02:17:52,056 --> 02:17:54,263
What? You wanted more?

2287
02:18:07,196 --> 02:18:09,153
(All shouting in unison)

2288
02:18:20,793 --> 02:18:22,750
Captain america: Avengers...

2289
02:18:27,883 --> 02:18:28,964
Assemble.

2290
02:18:29,051 --> 02:18:30,587
(All yelling)

(Drax yelling)

2296
02:19:26,066 --> 02:19:28,808
No, no, give me that.
You have the little one.

2297
02:19:42,499 --> 02:19:43,330
Spider-man: Hey!

2298
02:19:44,334 --> 02:19:45,324
Holy cow!

2299
02:19:45,502 --> 02:19:46,879
You will not believe
what's been going on.

2300
02:19:46,962 --> 02:19:48,168
Do you remember
when we were in space?

2301
02:19:48,338 --> 02:19:49,715
And I got all dusty?

2302
02:19:49,882 --> 02:19:50,963
And I must've passed out,

2303
02:19:51,050 --> 02:19:52,540
because I woke up
and you were gone.

2304
02:19:52,718 --> 02:19:54,334
But doctor strange was there,
right? And he was like...

2305
02:19:54,511 --> 02:19:56,013
"It's been five years.
Come on, they need us."

2306
02:19:56,180 --> 02:19:57,762
And then he started doing
the yellow sparkly thing

2307
02:19:57,848 --> 02:19:58,838
-that he does all the time.
-He did? Oh, no.

2308
02:19:59,016 --> 02:20:01,348
What are you doing?
Oh.

2309
02:20:05,355 --> 02:20:06,857
Oh, this is nice.

2310
02:20:20,954 --> 02:20:22,695
(Quill panting)

2311
02:20:28,629 --> 02:20:29,619
Gamora?

2312
02:20:39,056 --> 02:20:40,717
I thought I lost you.

2313
02:20:44,144 --> 02:20:45,225
Ow.

2314
02:20:45,312 --> 02:20:48,225
-(Groaning)
-Don't touch me!

2315
02:20:51,235 --> 02:20:53,067
You missed the first time.

2316
02:20:53,237 --> 02:20:55,228
Then you got 'em
both the second time.

2317
02:20:57,241 --> 02:20:58,322
Gamora: This is the one?

2318
02:20:58,492 --> 02:20:59,482
Seriously?

2319
02:20:59,660 --> 02:21:01,651
Your choices were him
or a tree.

2320
02:21:01,954 --> 02:21:03,365

2321

(Yelling)

2323
02:21:12,464 --> 02:21:13,454
Cap!

2324
02:21:13,632 --> 02:21:15,373
What do you want me to do
with this damn thing?

2325
02:21:18,095 --> 02:21:20,132
Get those stones
as far away as possible!

2326
02:21:20,305 --> 02:21:21,340
Smart hulk: No!

2327
02:21:22,516 --> 02:21:24,473
We need to get 'em back
where they came from.

2328
02:21:24,643 --> 02:21:25,633
No way to get 'em back.

2329
02:21:25,727 --> 02:21:27,229
Thanos destroyed
the quantum tunnel.

2330
02:21:27,396 --> 02:21:28,227
Ant-man: Hold on!

2331
02:21:30,107 --> 02:21:32,223
That wasn't
our only time machine.

2332
02:21:32,317 --> 02:21:34,308
(Horn plays la cucaracha)

2333
02:21:38,240 --> 02:21:40,151
Anyone see an ugly brown Van
out there?

2334
02:21:40,701 --> 02:21:43,784
Yes! But you're not gonna like
where it's parked!

2335
02:21:43,954 --> 02:21:46,070
Scott, how long you need
to get that thing working?

2336
02:21:47,291 --> 02:21:48,452
Uh, maybe 10 minutes.

2337
02:21:48,625 --> 02:21:50,127
Get it started.
We'll get the stones to you.

2338
02:21:50,294 --> 02:21:51,830
We're on it, cap.

2339
02:22:01,597 --> 02:22:02,712
Tony: Hey.

2340
02:22:02,890 --> 02:22:05,882
You said one out of
14 million, we win, yeah?

2341
02:22:06,810 --> 02:22:07,800
Tell me this is it.

2342
02:22:08,228 --> 02:22:10,094
If I tell you what happens...

2343
02:22:10,272 --> 02:22:11,433
It won't happen.

2344
02:22:15,027 --> 02:22:16,017
You better be right.

2345
02:22:24,453 --> 02:22:25,818
It's a mess back here.

2346
02:22:26,830 --> 02:22:27,820
It's dead.

2347
02:22:29,124 --> 02:22:30,626
-What?
-It's dead.

2348
02:22:30,792 --> 02:22:32,203
I have to hot-wire it.

2349
02:22:35,297 --> 02:22:36,503
Where's nebula?

2350
02:22:37,633 --> 02:22:38,964
She's not responding.

2351

(Yelling)

2358
02:23:17,130 --> 02:23:20,498
You took everything from me.

I Don't even know who you are.

2360

2440
02:33:37,542 --> 02:33:39,453
We're gonna be okay.

2441
02:33:42,755 --> 02:33:44,041
(Wheezing)

2442
02:33:44,173 --> 02:33:46,039
You can rest now.

2443
02:33:46,676 --> 02:33:47,882
(Wheezing stops)

2444
02:34:30,970 --> 02:34:32,426
(Sobbing)

2445
02:35:20,061 --> 02:35:21,301
(Inaudible)

2446
02:35:31,572 --> 02:35:34,360
Tony: Everybody wants
a happy ending, right?

2447
02:35:34,534 --> 02:35:36,741
But it doesn't
always roll that way.

2448
02:35:38,830 --> 02:35:40,491
Maybe this time.

2449
02:35:42,083 --> 02:35:44,745
I'm hoping
if you play this back...

2450
02:35:46,421 --> 02:35:47,752
It's in celebration.

2451
02:35:49,007 --> 02:35:52,671
I hope families are reunited.
I hope we get it back.

2452
02:35:52,844 --> 02:35:54,426
And something like
a normal version

2453
02:35:54,512 --> 02:35:56,753
of the planet
has been restored.

2454
02:35:56,931 --> 02:35:58,888
If there ever was
such a thing.

2455
02:35:59,475 --> 02:36:02,467
God, what a world.
Universe, now.

2456
02:36:03,438 --> 02:36:05,429
If you told me 10 years ago
that we weren't alone...

2457
02:36:05,606 --> 02:36:07,597
Let alone to this extent,
I mean,

2458
02:36:07,692 --> 02:36:09,274
(stammers) / wouldn't have
been surprised...

2459
02:36:09,444 --> 02:36:11,060
But come on, who knew?

2460
02:36:11,237 --> 02:36:14,025
The epic forces
of darkness and light

2461
02:36:14,115 --> 02:36:15,856
that have come into play.

2462
02:36:16,034 --> 02:36:17,741
And for better or worse...

2463
02:36:17,910 --> 02:36:19,571
That's the reality
Morgan's gonna

2464
02:36:19,662 --> 02:36:22,074
have to find a way
to grow up in.

2465
02:36:22,165 --> 02:36:23,405
(Whirring)

2466
02:36:25,334 --> 02:36:26,039
So, I thought I'd probably

2467
02:36:26,127 --> 02:36:27,117
better record
a little greeting...

2468
02:36:27,295 --> 02:36:30,913
In the case of an untimely
death. On my part.

2469
02:36:31,090 --> 02:36:34,333
Not that death at any time
isn't untimely.

2470
02:36:35,553 --> 02:36:36,884
This time travel thing
that we're gonna

2471
02:36:36,971 --> 02:36:38,587
try and pull off tomorrow...

2472
02:36:38,765 --> 02:36:39,755
It's got me
scratching my head

2473
02:36:39,849 --> 02:36:40,964
about the survivability
of it all.

2474
02:36:41,142 --> 02:36:42,598
That's the thing.

2475
02:36:44,562 --> 02:36:46,473
Then again,
that's the hero gig, right?

2476
02:36:46,647 --> 02:36:47,728
Part of the journey
is the end.

2477
02:36:49,734 --> 02:36:50,724
What am I even tripping for?

2478
02:36:50,902 --> 02:36:51,983
Everything is gonna work out

2479
02:36:52,070 --> 02:36:54,983
<i>exactly the way
it's supposed to.</i>

2480
02:36:58,493 --> 02:37:00,154
I love you 3,000.

2481
02:37:03,331 --> 02:37:04,412
(Gasps softly)

2482
02:39:15,087 --> 02:39:17,545
You know,
I wish there was a way

2483
02:39:17,632 --> 02:39:18,838
that I could let her know.

2484
02:39:21,344 --> 02:39:23,460
That we won.

2485
02:39:24,847 --> 02:39:26,554
We did it.

2486
02:39:30,144 --> 02:39:31,930
She knows.

2487
02:39:36,817 --> 02:39:38,899
They both do.

2488
02:39:47,870 --> 02:39:48,951
Happy: How you doing, squirt?

2489
02:39:49,121 --> 02:39:50,111
Good.

2490
02:39:50,289 --> 02:39:51,620
-You good?
-Mm-hmm.

2491
02:39:51,791 --> 02:39:54,499
-Good. You hungry?
-Mm-hmm.

2492
02:39:54,919 --> 02:39:55,909
What do you want?

2493
02:39:56,629 --> 02:39:58,040
Cheeseburgers.

2494
02:40:02,843 --> 02:40:05,096
You know,
your dad liked cheeseburgers.

2495
02:40:05,263 --> 02:40:06,674
Okay.

2496
02:40:09,267 --> 02:40:11,508
I'm gonna get you all
the cheeseburgers you want.

2497
02:40:11,686 --> 02:40:12,676
Okay.

2498
02:40:20,653 --> 02:40:22,314
(Bird calling in distance)

2499
02:40:24,156 --> 02:40:25,942
(Bell clanging in distance)

2500
02:40:26,409 --> 02:40:27,945
(Footsteps rustling)

2501
02:40:29,453 --> 02:40:30,864
Valkyrie: So...

2502
02:40:31,122 --> 02:40:33,284
When can we expect you back?

2503
02:40:33,624 --> 02:40:34,785
(Thor smacks lips)

2504
02:40:34,875 --> 02:40:36,707
Um, about that...

2505
02:40:36,961 --> 02:40:39,123
Thor, your people need a king.

2506
02:40:39,297 --> 02:40:41,163
No, they already have one.

2507
02:40:41,549 --> 02:40:42,710
(Laughs)

2508
02:40:43,301 --> 02:40:44,291
That's funny.

2509
02:40:49,890 --> 02:40:51,722
Are you being serious?

2510
02:40:55,396 --> 02:40:57,637
It's time for me
to be who I am...

2511
02:40:58,232 --> 02:41:00,815
Rather than
who I'm supposed to be.

2512
02:41:02,111 --> 02:41:03,852
But you, you're a leader.

2513
02:41:04,488 --> 02:41:06,195
That's who you are.

2514
02:41:08,701 --> 02:41:10,658
You know, I'd make
a lot of changes around here.

2515
02:41:10,828 --> 02:41:12,330
(Chuckles)
I'm counting on it...

2516
02:41:12,496 --> 02:41:13,998
Your majesty.

2517
02:41:24,133 --> 02:41:25,339
What will you do?

2518
02:41:26,093 --> 02:41:27,504
I'm not sure.

2519
02:41:27,678 --> 02:41:29,715
For the first time
in a thousand years,

2520
02:41:29,805 --> 02:41:31,216
I have no path.

2521
02:41:31,390 --> 02:41:32,801
I do have a ride though.

2522
02:41:32,975 --> 02:41:34,932
Move it or lose it, hairbag.

2523
02:41:35,019 --> 02:41:36,134
(Thor chuckles)

2524
02:41:39,440 --> 02:41:40,976
Thor: Oh, here we are!

2525
02:41:41,442 --> 02:41:42,978
Tree, good to see you.

2526
02:41:45,988 --> 02:41:47,103
(Grunts)

2527
02:41:47,573 --> 02:41:50,861
The asgardians of the galaxy
back together again.

2528
02:41:51,285 --> 02:41:53,151
Where to first?

2529
02:41:54,288 --> 02:41:55,323
Hey.

2530
02:41:55,956 --> 02:41:57,913
Just So you know,
this is my ship still.

2531
02:41:58,084 --> 02:41:59,074
I'm in charge.

2532
02:41:59,627 --> 02:42:02,164
I Know. I Know.
Of course you are.

2533
02:42:02,338 --> 02:42:03,874
Of course.

2534
02:42:03,964 --> 02:42:04,829
(Beeps)

2535
02:42:04,924 --> 02:42:06,414
(Drax crunching)

2536
02:42:06,509 --> 02:42:09,046
See, you say, "of course,"
but then you touch the map.

2537
02:42:09,220 --> 02:42:10,255
It makes you think that maybe

2538
02:42:10,346 --> 02:42:11,711
you didn't realize
I was in charge.

2539
02:42:12,348 --> 02:42:13,679
Quail, that's your own
insecurities in there.

2540
02:42:13,849 --> 02:42:14,839
Quail?

2541
02:42:15,017 --> 02:42:17,258
Okay? I am merely trying to
be of service and assisting.

2542
02:42:17,436 --> 02:42:18,642
Quill.

2543
02:42:18,813 --> 02:42:19,678
That's what I said.

2544
02:42:19,855 --> 02:42:22,233
You should fight one another
for the honor of leadership.

2545
02:42:22,400 --> 02:42:23,765
Sounds fair.

2546
02:42:25,236 --> 02:42:26,442
(Quill stammers)

2547
02:42:26,529 --> 02:42:28,896
-It's not necessary, okay?
-It's not.

2548
02:42:29,073 --> 02:42:30,063
Rocket: I got some blasters,

2549
02:42:30,157 --> 02:42:31,443
unless you guys
wanna use knives.

2550
02:42:31,617 --> 02:42:33,824
Oh, yes! Please, use knives.

2551
02:42:33,994 --> 02:42:35,075
Yeah. Knives.

2552
02:42:35,246 --> 02:42:36,782
I am groot.

2553
02:42:38,124 --> 02:42:39,865
(Both laugh)

2554
02:42:42,545 --> 02:42:43,910
Not necessary.

2555
02:42:44,088 --> 02:42:45,544
There shall be
no knifing one another.

2556
02:42:45,714 --> 02:42:48,706
Everybody knows
who's in charge.

2557
02:42:49,510 --> 02:42:51,797
(Thor sighs, smacks lips)

2558
02:42:52,304 --> 02:42:53,510
Me.

2559
02:42:54,598 --> 02:42:55,429
Right?

2560
02:42:56,350 --> 02:42:58,557
Yes, you. (Laughs)

2561
02:42:58,811 --> 02:43:01,223
Of course! Of course.

2562
02:43:01,397 --> 02:43:03,058
Of course.

2563
02:43:04,817 --> 02:43:06,353
Smart hulk: Remember...

2564
02:43:07,194 --> 02:43:08,400
You have to return the stones

2565
02:43:08,487 --> 02:43:09,477
to the exact moment
you got 'em...

2566
02:43:09,655 --> 02:43:10,645
Or you're gonna open up

2567
02:43:10,739 --> 02:43:12,867
a bunch of nasty
alternative realities.

2568
02:43:13,033 --> 02:43:14,023
Don't worry, Bruce.

2569
02:43:14,577 --> 02:43:16,443
Clip all the branches.

2570
02:43:16,996 --> 02:43:18,737
You know, I tried.

2571
02:43:20,040 --> 02:43:22,031
When I had the gauntlet,
the stones,

2572
02:43:22,126 --> 02:43:24,242
I really tried
to bring her back.

2573
02:43:27,548 --> 02:43:29,164
I miss her, man.

2574
02:43:29,550 --> 02:43:30,540
Me too.

2575
02:43:33,137 --> 02:43:34,548
(Helicopter whirring)

2576
02:43:34,638 --> 02:43:37,050
Sam: You know, if you want,
I could come with you.

2577
02:43:39,643 --> 02:43:41,099
You're a good man, Sam.

2578
02:43:41,645 --> 02:43:43,181
This one's on me, though.

2579
02:43:47,651 --> 02:43:49,562
Don't do anything stupid
till I get back.

2580
02:43:51,405 --> 02:43:52,645
How can 1?

2581
02:43:52,823 --> 02:43:54,609
You're taking
all the stupid with you.

2582
02:44:02,208 --> 02:44:03,994
Gonna miss you, buddy.

2583
02:44:04,376 --> 02:44:05,878
It's gonna be okay, buck.

2584
02:44:09,715 --> 02:44:11,001
(Machine whirring)

2585
02:44:13,260 --> 02:44:15,046
How long is this gonna take?

2586
02:44:15,304 --> 02:44:18,046
For him, as long as he needs.
For us, five seconds.

2587
02:44:23,145 --> 02:44:24,385
You ready, cap?

2588
02:44:24,563 --> 02:44:26,975
All right, we'll meet you
back here, okay?

2589
02:44:27,650 --> 02:44:28,765
You bet.

2590
02:44:30,277 --> 02:44:31,859
Smart hulk: Going quantum.
Three...

2591
02:44:32,446 --> 02:44:33,277
Two...

2592
02:44:33,948 --> 02:44:35,154
One.

2593
02:44:37,034 --> 02:44:39,071
And returning in five...

2594
02:44:39,245 --> 02:44:40,201
Four...

2595
02:44:40,371 --> 02:44:42,203
Three, two...

2596
02:44:42,373 --> 02:44:43,704
One.

2597
02:44:50,965 --> 02:44:51,955
Where is he?

2598
02:44:52,132 --> 02:44:53,873
I Don't know. He blew
right by his time stamp.

2599
02:44:54,051 --> 02:44:55,507
He should be here.

2600
02:45:01,016 --> 02:45:01,926
Sam: Get him back.

2601
02:45:02,101 --> 02:45:03,216
Smart hulk: I'm trying.
Sam: Get him the hell back.

2602
02:45:03,394 --> 02:45:05,260
-Hey, I said I'm trying.
-Sam.

2603
02:45:29,253 --> 02:45:30,835
Go ahead.

2604
02:45:48,814 --> 02:45:49,565
Cap?

2605
02:45:51,900 --> 02:45:53,641
Hi, Sam.

2606
02:45:56,655 --> 02:45:59,693
So, did something go wrong
or did something go right?

2607
02:46:01,827 --> 02:46:05,661
Well, after I put
the stones back, I thought...

2608
02:46:06,790 --> 02:46:08,121
Maybe...

2609
02:46:08,626 --> 02:46:13,416
I'll try some of that life
Tony was telling me to get.

2610
02:46:15,424 --> 02:46:17,540
How'd that work out for ya?

2611
02:46:20,054 --> 02:46:21,465
It was beautiful.

2612
02:46:22,806 --> 02:46:24,513
Good. I'm happy for you.

2613
02:46:24,683 --> 02:46:25,718
Truly.

2614
02:46:26,477 --> 02:46:27,763
Thank you.

2615
02:46:29,104 --> 02:46:30,356
Only thing bumming me out...

2616
02:46:30,522 --> 02:46:32,104
Is the fact
I have to live in a world

2617
02:46:32,191 --> 02:46:34,102
without captain america.

2618
02:46:34,693 --> 02:46:35,854
Steve: Oh.

2619
02:46:37,905 --> 02:46:40,693
That reminds me.

2620
02:46:49,208 --> 02:46:50,414
Try it on.

2621
02:47:15,943 --> 02:47:17,433
How does it feel?

2622
02:47:20,030 --> 02:47:21,737
Like it's someone else's.

2623
02:47:24,785 --> 02:47:25,946
It isn't.

2624
02:47:29,665 --> 02:47:31,030
(Sighs)

2625
02:47:39,299 --> 02:47:40,881
Thank you.

2626
02:47:42,594 --> 02:47:43,880
I'll do my best.

2627
02:47:49,268 --> 02:47:51,179
That's why it's yours.

2628
02:47:52,896 --> 02:47:54,273
You wanna tell me about her?

2629
02:48:00,863 --> 02:48:02,353
No.

2630
02:48:02,781 --> 02:48:04,897
No, I Don't think I will.
