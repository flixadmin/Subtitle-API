I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,

3

but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

4
00:00:13,429 --> 00:00:16,399
I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.

5

I hunted down the man
who killed my mother,

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,280
but in doing so,
I opened up our world to new threats.

7

fast enough to stop them.

see what we come up with.

318
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,660
I'll see if facial recognition
brings him up

319
00:17:49,859 --> 00:17:51,988
and I'll have Joe check
C.C.P.D.'s database.

320
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,828
Cool. Let's see what you can do.

321
00:17:55,156 --> 00:17:56,328
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

322
00:17:57,742 --> 00:18:00,040
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

323
00:18:00,453 --> 00:18:01,922
CAITLIN: (GRUNTS)
I'm going as fast as I can.

324
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:05,460

Zoom will be back any minute.

325
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,594
CAITLIN: I could just leave you in there,
you know.

326
00:18:07,752 --> 00:18:08,753
FROST: Oh.

327
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,804
But you want to go home so badly.

328
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,185
So, how did this happen to you?

329
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,181
Woke up one day,

330
00:18:18,346 --> 00:18:20,348
cold, pale,

331
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,151
thought I was sick.

332
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:25,188
Turned out it was something else entirely.

333
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,355
(ICE CRACKLING)

334
00:18:26,521 --> 00:18:29,491
You got hit by the dark matter
from the particle accelerator explosion?

335
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:34,365
Yes. Right after I flunked out
of med school.

336
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,037
Had to move back in with my mother.

337
00:18:37,782 --> 00:18:42,038
That couldn't have been fun.
If she's anything like mine, I mean.

338
00:18:42,203 --> 00:18:46,049
Why, is yours a frigid narcissist, too?

339
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,209
Cold as ice.

340
00:18:47,542 --> 00:18:51,513
Yeah, Mom was like that
ever since Charlie died.

341
00:18:51,963 --> 00:18:53,010
Who's Charlie?

342
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,512
My brother.

343
00:18:54,884 --> 00:18:56,181
I never had a brother.

344
00:18:56,426 --> 00:19:00,477
No? Then why was Mom such a bitch
on your Earth?

345
00:19:01,848 --> 00:19:03,226
Honestly, I couldn't say.

346
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:11,034
So, how is this
going to get me out of here?

347
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:15,571
The electrical current in the cable
should heat up the carbyne,

348
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:18,240
which, in turn,
should speed up the electrons.

349
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,788
And the faster they go...

350
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:22,294
The weaker
its molecular structure becomes.

351
00:19:22,912 --> 00:19:23,913
Exactly.

352
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:25,423
Hmm.

353
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,712
I studied every once in a while.

354
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,051
Well, when it gets hot enough,

355
00:19:30,211 --> 00:19:32,759
it should make the carbyne
as fragile as glass.

356
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:36,601
And then we can both get out of here.

357

you got something on your mind.

00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:07,294
Wha... It's just one time,
that's all I'm asking.

366
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,795
It's impossible.

367
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,962
He saved my life, Joe.
I owe him a thank you.

368
00:20:17,298 --> 00:20:18,299
Look.

I did everything at full speed
without a care in the world.

372
00:20:31,689 --> 00:20:33,907
But it wasn't until Zoom took me,

373
00:20:36,067 --> 00:20:37,740
that I really thought I was gonna die.

374
00:20:39,195 --> 00:20:43,497
And I was going to die
if The Flash didn't do what he did.

375
00:20:45,493 --> 00:20:50,170
He gave up his powers to save me,
a guy he didn't even know.

376
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,630
No one's ever done anything like that
for me before.

377
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,387
I need to tell him
how much that means to me.

378
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:06,228
Well, all right.

So, his genes have actually mutated.

I ran the DNA from the blood sample
Barry found

and the functional myostatin in his cells

Um, I saw him age. Right in front of me.

Yeah, he's suffering from

And then Zoom took you and I snapped.

634
00:36:42,449 --> 00:36:43,952
I just snapped.

635
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:46,000
I couldn't breathe, I...

636
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:52,795
I couldn't lose the only other person
that I love.

637
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,512
Yeah, yeah, I get that.

638
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:00,936
I understand why
you did everything you did to protect me.

639
00:37:01,885 --> 00:37:03,728
I mean, you were only missing one day

640
00:37:03,887 --> 00:37:06,141
and I would have done anything
to find you.

641
00:37:06,306 --> 00:37:07,684
(CHUCKLES)

642
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:09,478
But... I mean.

643
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:13,820
I need to know that
that's never gonna happen again, okay?

644
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,742
Every time I stay out late,
or get in trouble,

645
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:21,039
you can't track me down, or hurt someone
'cause you're trying to save me.

646
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,615
Yeah, but you're in danger.

647
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,329
- I know.
- Okay.

648
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,623
I will make you a promise.

649
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:37,304
I promise you I will be the kind of father
that you can be proud of,

650
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:42,014
if you promise me
you will never run away from me again.

651
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,853
(LAUGHS) Okay. Okay, deal.

652
00:37:47,222 --> 00:37:48,269
I love you, Dad.

653
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:49,641
I love you too.

00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:54,530

00:38:00,235 --> 00:38:02,034
Relax, he'll be here.

657
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:06,367
What should I say?
I mean, I don't even know where to start.

658
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:09,378
Just be honest. Speak from your heart.

659
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,001
Okay.

660
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,882
THE FLASH: Wally West.

661
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,626
I'll see you at home.

662
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,842
You wanted to see me.

663
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:22,391
Uh, yes. ldid. I mean, I do.

664
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,018
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

665
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:26,099
Um... (CLEARS THROAT)

666
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:29,018
I just wanted to thank you
for saving my life.

667
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:33,938
And I know that
that came at a huge price for you.

668
00:38:34,853 --> 00:38:37,402
And I don't know how I'll ever repay that.

669
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:43,036
I guess what I wanted to say was that

670
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,748
I'm not gonna waste this chance
that you've given me.

671
00:38:48,742 --> 00:38:49,835
Thank you.

672
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:54,132
You're welcome, Wally.

675
00:39:16,311 --> 00:39:17,780
Stay away from me.

676
00:39:19,731 --> 00:39:21,655
Killer Frost tried to kill you, Caitlin.

677
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,909
I saved your life.

678
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:27,949
You should thank me.

679
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:29,534
I just wanna go home.

680
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:32,496
No. Stay.

681
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:37,550
I want to leave!

ASHLEY: (ECHOING) No!

684
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:47,219
Please, take me back to my Earth.

685
00:39:51,179 --> 00:39:52,271
You know,

686
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:57,070
I've always measured my success by
counting the number of victims I've had.

687
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,447
But now I think I'm gonna widen my scope

688
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:06,362
and start counting the number of Earths
I conquer instead.

689
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,322
You wanna go home?

690
00:40:10,617 --> 00:40:13,335
Let's go. After all,

691
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:16,043
this Earth has already been
brought to its knees.

692
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,773
Well, you're here early.

693
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:41,360
Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

694
00:40:41,521 --> 00:40:42,818
Me, neither.

695
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:46,911
I know that we just took down Gray
without my powers, but...

696
00:40:48,987 --> 00:40:51,456
I have no idea
how to get Caitlin back without them.

697
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:53,539
We can't, Allen.

698
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:56,161
Then what are we gonna do?

699
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:00,958
Gray...

700
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:04,884
Gray kidnapped me

701
00:41:06,463 --> 00:41:10,264
because he thought I was Harrison Wells
from this Earth.

702
00:41:10,425 --> 00:41:13,521
I know he was talking about another guy,
but I just...

703
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:20,061
I can't help but think.
I still haven't paid for what I've done.

704
00:41:21,396 --> 00:41:22,396
What does that mean?

(SIGHS)

706
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:32,574
I thought, you know, when you...
When we closed the breaches,

707
00:41:32,739 --> 00:41:36,414
I could just forget
about everything I've done, but I can't.

708
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:41,666
I realize what I can do.

709
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:48,885
You are gonna get your speed back, Allen.
And I'm gonna help you do that.

710
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:52,092
How?
