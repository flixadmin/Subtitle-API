1
00:00:00,208 --> 00:00:02,919
Please, just let me explain.
I mean you no harm.

2
00:00:03,586 --> 00:00:04,671
How do you know my name?

3
00:00:04,837 --> 00:00:08,841
I know all your names. Caitlin Snow.
Cisco Ramon. Detective Joe West.

4
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:12,595
Enough! That part about "explaining"
needs to happen right about now.

5
00:00:13,012 --> 00:00:14,306
This world is in danger.

6
00:00:14,514 --> 00:00:16,183
What other worlds are there?

7
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:18,393
When you created the Singularity
above Central City,

8
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:21,521
you also created a breach
between my world and yours.

9
00:00:21,729 --> 00:00:23,190
I'm sorry. A breach?

10
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:25,858
Yes. A portal, connecting our two Earths.

11
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:28,528
And what precisely is your concern?

12
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:32,199
A few days ago, you found a dead man
named Al Rothstein at the nuclear plant.

13
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,576
<i>But then, a different Al Rothstein
tried to kill you.</i>

14
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:35,868
Atom Smasher.

15
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,204
That man was from my world.

16
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:40,248
If he got through the breach,
I suspect there'll be more to follow.

17
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:46,213
Okay. So, Jay,
how exactly do you know all this?

18
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,924
Where I came from,
I was a speedster like you.

19
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,219
They called me the Flash.

20
00:00:59,892 --> 00:01:04,397
JAY: <i>Before I arrived on your Earth,
I was in a fight with a man named Zoom.</i>

21
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,566
Zoom?

22
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:09,402
I've heard that name before.

23
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:14,157
Atom Smasher, he said
Zoom sent him here to kill me.

24
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,033
Who is this guy?

25
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:18,495
He's a speedster, like you and me.
And fast.

26
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,498
Maybe the fastest of all, but evil.

27
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:25,084
He is an unstoppable demon
with the face of death.

28
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:31,090
<i>We were engaged
in our fiercest battle ever,</i>

29
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:34,511
<i>racing throughout my city,
but I wasn't fast enough to stop him.</i>

30
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,096
(SCREAMS) <i>Zoom had me beaten.</i>

31
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,806
(SCREAMING)

32
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:40,767
<i>He was about to kill me, when suddenly,</i>

33
00:01:40,933 --> 00:01:43,520
<i>there was a blinding light,
and the sky split open.</i>

34
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:48,650
<i>A breach, between my world and yours
caused from the Singularity.</i>

35
00:01:49,942 --> 00:01:51,444
<i>It pulled me in</i>

36
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:59,619
and I somehow ended up in your world.

37
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:01,829
Powerless. Unable to return home.

38
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,290
What do you mean?

39
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:04,791
I lost my speed.

40
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,168
How?

41
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,295
{\an8}I'm not entirely sure.

42
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,550
{\an8}So, you've been in Central City
for six months.

43
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,218
{\an8}Why haven't you come to see us before?

44
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:18,221
{\an8}I'm in a foreign world here, Detective.
I didn't know who you all were.

45
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,473
{\an8}Took me that long
to piece it all together.

46
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:24,101
{\an8}So that's how you know our names.
You've been following us.

47
00:02:24,977 --> 00:02:27,564
{\an8}Look, I know how this sounds.

48
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:31,734
{\an8}The existence of another Earth,
you, another Flash?

49
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,363
{\an8}It all came as an unexpected shock
to me, too.

50
00:02:36,113 --> 00:02:38,866
{\an8}<i>I just wish there was something
I could do to convince you.</i>

51
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:43,496
{\an8}There is.
We're gonna do some tests on you.

52
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,748
{\an8}See if you're telling us the truth.

53
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,711
{\an8}Because if you're not, this Zoom

54
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:53,298
{\an8}is not gonna be your only enemy.

55
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,765
(GRUNTS AND GROANS)

56
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,477
Where the hell am I?

57
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:09,981
(DISTORTED) You wanna go home?
You only have to do one thing.

58
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:13,318
-What's that?
-(DISTORTED) Kill the Flash.

59
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,618
{\an8}So, Mr. Garrick, how long have you been
the Flash on your world?

60
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,202
{\an8}Not long enough to call me "Mister."

61
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,454
{\an8}(LIGHT CHUCKLE)

62
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:25,705
{\an8}Please, it's Jay.

63
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:26,998
{\an8}Jay, of course.

64
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:29,626
{\an8}On my world, I've been the Flash
for about two years.

65
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:32,044
{\an8}And how did you get your speed?

66
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:35,382
{\an8}I'm not really sure. I was at my lab
trying to purify heavy water

67
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,135
{\an8}without any residual radiation
when there was a blinding light.

68
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,595
{\an8}Uh, I fell into a coma.

69
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:43,055
{\an8}When I woke up, I could run
almost as fast as the speed of light.

70
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:48,270
{\an8}Sorry, did you say "lab?"
Are you a scientist?

71
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,398
{\an8}Well, certainly didn't work at a place
like this but yeah.

72
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,733
{\an8}I had a respectable solo operation.

73
00:03:53,941 --> 00:03:56,653
{\an8}Part-time chemist. Part-time physicist.
Part-time superhero.

74
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:57,904
{\an8}Hmm.

75
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:00,657
{\an8}I can forget that
superhero part now though, huh. (CHUCKLES)

76
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:05,245
{\an8}Is any of this possible? A breach
to another Earth? It's not, right?

77
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:08,164
{\an8}The contrary. Just recently,
the many-different-worlds theory proposed

78
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:11,418
{\an8}interaction with parallel universes
was plausible.

79
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,253
{\an8}Now, if what Mr. Garrick's saying is true,

80
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,713
{\an8}that theory's been proven
sooner than we all thought.

81
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,006
{\an8}It doesn't add up.

82
00:04:17,214 --> 00:04:18,800
{\an8}I'm gonna be honest here.
I don't understand

83
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,718
{\an8}what the hell any of you
are talking about.

84
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:25,139
{\an8}So, Jay is saying he's from,
like, a mirror world.

85
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:29,686
{\an8}Or a parallel universe,
that's very, very similar to ours.

86
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,814
{\an8}Multi-verse would be
a more apt description.

87
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:34,649
{\an8}Nope. Not helping.

88
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:37,569
{\an8}-Bless your heart.
-Okay, see if this helps.

89
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:45,285
{\an8}This is our Earth.
Let's call it, Earth One.

90
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,624
And this second Earth,
let's call it, Earth Two.

91
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,919
This is where Jay claims to be from.

92
00:04:55,127 --> 00:05:00,675
And these other Earths,
three, four, five, to infinity.

93
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:06,389
All of them are nearly identical to ours,
and, uh, they all exist at the same time,

94
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:09,809
giving us endless alternatives
to what we have here.

95
00:05:10,017 --> 00:05:14,105
For example, uh, the Joe West
on Earth Two, your doppelganger,

96
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:18,067
he might not be a detective. He could be
a Nobel Prize-winning physicist.

97
00:05:18,275 --> 00:05:21,571
And you, the Barry Allen here
is the Flash,

98
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:25,367
but over there,
he could be an electrician.

99
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:29,746
So I'm assuming that
the people on all these other Earths

100
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,332
work to make money to pay bills and such?

101
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,250
-I would imagine.
-So we got that in common.

102
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:37,504
I'm heading back to the station. Call me
when this makes a little bit more sense.

103
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,006
I'm still trying to wrap my head
around the whole idea of time travel.

104
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,298
(CHUCKLES)

105
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,429
There is one problem that remains.

106
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,598
If Mr. Garrick is telling the truth,

107
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,808
there is a breach
somewhere in Central City

108
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,436
that we need to find. And close for good.

109
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:56,439
Yeah, but how do we find it?
We don't even know what to look for.

110
00:05:56,648 --> 00:06:01,318
Well, I suggest we put our heads
together and come up with a solution.

111
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:06,032
Not literally, of course.
Those days are over.

112
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,038
What'd you find?

113
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:14,541
Well, Jay's heart rate
is extraordinarily low.

114
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,502
And he does have
regenerative capabilities.

115
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,462
Other than that,
I'm not seeing any evidence

116
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:21,047
of the speed force in his system.

117
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:23,966
We don't even have proof that he's
a speedster, much less from another Earth?

118
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,636
-Not necessarily.
-What does that mean?

119
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:29,472
Well, Jay doesn't know this,
but while I was testing

120
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,808
his heart rate, blood pressure
and motor responses,

121
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:36,020
I also measured his autonomic reactions
while we were talking.

122
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:37,897
You gave him a lie-detector test?

123
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,315
And he passed it.

124
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,864
What if he's not a good guy,
and he just wants to find our weaknesses?

125
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,742
Keep running tests.
See what else you can find out.

Captain Singh mentioned
there may be positions available

on your anti-meta-human task force.

132
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,476
Yeah. Everybody quit.
There is no task force anymore.

133
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,436
Well, I know someone
who's interested in being on it.

134
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,146
Me.

135
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,065
You do realize that meta-humans

136
00:07:21,273 --> 00:07:22,567
-have super-powers, right?
-Yeah.

137
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,945
And even if they didn't,
you wouldn't be a good fit for the team.

138
00:07:26,153 --> 00:07:27,321
Because I'm a woman?

139

I didn't mean to imply that.

140

Good, because I know
how difficult this job would be,

141
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,661
but I think I'm an excellent candidate.

142
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,247
I triple-majored at Hudson
in Biology, Chemistry and Physics.

Are you aware of what happened
to my previous partner?

147
00:07:47,174 --> 00:07:49,218
Detective Thawne, yes.
I know that he died,

148
00:07:49,426 --> 00:07:51,763
and the one before him,
Fred Chyre, died, too.

149
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,265
But the one before, that's not dead,
just transferred.

150
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,308
I'm sure it had nothing to do with you.

Listen, Officer...

152
00:07:58,269 --> 00:07:59,687
Spivot. Patty Spivot.

153
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,856
Yes, Spivot. The answer's no.

154
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:05,026
All I'm asking for is a shot, sir.
Please, just an interview.

155
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,737
You just had the interview.
Didn't get the job.

156
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,123
I hope you understand
why we have to do this.

157
00:08:19,331 --> 00:08:22,459
I get it, kid. You're doing
what you think you have to.

158
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:25,672
But you'll all realize soon enough
that this, the tests,

159
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,465
it's unnecessary.
I want to help you, Barry. Not harm you.

160
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,593
You're not the first person
that's said that to me.

161
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:34,221
If what you told me about Zoom is true,
that he sent Rothstein here to kill you,

162
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,473
instead of locking me up in here,
you better start listening.

163
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,060
Because if Zoom is involved,
you are going to need

164
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:41,813
<i>a lot more than just me
at your side to stay alive.</i>

-What was that?
-THE FLASH: I don't know.

-Hey.

184

What are we dealing with here?

185
00:10:12,569 --> 00:10:16,198
(SIGHS) Well, definitely a meta-human.
Got a pretty solid look at him

186
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:19,451
between punches
and he was, like, made of sand?

187
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,078
-Sand? Okay.
-Mmm-hmm.

188
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,456
These walls are too porous
to pull any prints.

189
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,919
I can't even get one off the boat.
But check this out.

190
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,380
There's gasoline burns everywhere.

191
00:10:31,588 --> 00:10:34,717
Water didn't go off.
Sprinklers weren't working.

192
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:36,552
This was arson.

193
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:39,555
Excuse me, Barry Allen?

194
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,348
-Yeah.
-Hi.

195
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:44,143
Two days in a row, Officer.
What a coincidence.

196
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:47,313
Or kismet,
if you believe in destiny or fate.

197
00:10:49,356 --> 00:10:51,358
-I'm Patty. Patty Spivot.
-Hey.

198
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,402
I'm really excited to meet you.
I'm a huge fan.

199
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,238
-Excuse me?
-Your forensic reports.

200
00:10:56,948 --> 00:11:00,868
I read them sometimes. Who am I kidding?
All the time. I've actually read them all.

201
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,286
(CHUCKLES)

202
00:11:02,494 --> 00:11:04,789
Wow, I don't think
that I've read them all.

203
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,958
They're always so detailed, you know.
They really paint a picture

204
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,461
like you were somehow actually there
when somebody was being brutally murdered.

205
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,005
Thank you.

206
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:17,634
Uh, anyhow, I found, uh, something.
Well, I think I found something.

207
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:19,887
It's just a theory,
but I would like to show you.

208
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,138
Great.

209
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,641
So, this right here
is the point of origin of the fire.

210
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:28,354
And look. I don't know
a sand blaster on the market

211
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:32,399
that can make a cut that precise. So,
I think a meta-human may have done this.

212
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,819
Here. I took a sample for you.

213
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,904
Uh, there's also some fingerprints
on the back of the pipe.

214
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,406
Should've gone into CSI work.

215
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:42,201
I love the science,
but out here's where all the action is.

216
00:11:42,409 --> 00:11:44,120
-Isn't that right, Detective West?
-(CHUCKLES)

217
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,497
The answer's still "no," Officer...

-Spivot.
-Spivot.

219
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:49,041
Yeah.

220
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,335
What was that about?

221
00:11:51,543 --> 00:11:53,462
I'm trying to join
the anti-meta-human task force.

222
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,713
Ah.

223
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:57,800
But you heard him.
Hey, he's kind of like your dad, right?

224
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:00,344
So, do you have any advice
on how I can crack his "no" code?

225
00:12:00,552 --> 00:12:01,971
Yeah, I've been trying to pick that lock

226
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,430
-since I was 11.
-(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

227
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,724
So, if you figure it out,
how about you let me know?

228
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,018
-Deal.
-All right.

229
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,353
-It was nice to meet you, Barry.
-Yeah, you, too.

230
00:12:09,561 --> 00:12:10,604

his heart rate is low,

233
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,078
Yeah, but nothing compared to Barry's.

00:12:26,703 --> 00:12:29,331
No, but he's certainly
in the physical specimen range.

235
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,877
-In more ways than one?
-Hmm?

236
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:38,174
Oh, I wasn't paying attention.
That's enough for today, Jay. Thank you.

237
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,386
BARRY: Found it at the crime scene.

238
00:12:42,594 --> 00:12:45,681
I mean, it's gotta be
from the meta-human that attacked me.

239
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:46,933
Huh.

240
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,935
-What is this stuff? Sand?
-(SIGHS)

241
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:52,021
It's not sand. It's human cells
whose myosin-two protein

242
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,231
<i>have migrated to the cells' periphery.</i>

243
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,233
Jay's a fellow science nerd.

244
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:59,070
Those cells have the ability
to rearrange and harden,

245
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,280
giving them the appearance of sand.

246
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,949
Mmm, how do you know this?

247
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,910
They belong to a meta-human
I've fought before named Sand Demon.

248
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:08,537
I know you're new here,
so I'm just gonna break it down for you.

249
00:13:08,745 --> 00:13:11,457
The whole naming the bad guys thing,
that's my jam.

250
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,292
But you know what?
I'm gonna let you have that one,

251
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,211
'cause I actually kind of like it.
I'm not mad at that one.

252
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:16,462
Is that Barry's sweatshirt?

253
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:19,298
Oh, uh, sorry. It was all we could find.

254
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,634
I was gonna say 'cause it looks
a lot smaller on you, right?

(CHUCKLES)

256
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,390
I gotta do this thing.

257
00:13:29,641 --> 00:13:31,936
So, who is this Sand Demon?

258
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:34,771
I don't know his name,
but I know how to stop him.

259
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:37,774
You know what,
I think we'll be fine on our own.

260
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:41,988
Look, Barry, I don't know what else
I can do to prove to you I'm on your side.

261
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:46,492
I've been poked, prodded, I even
subjected myself to a full body scan.

262
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:47,826
I was being thorough.

263
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:51,330
Sand Demon's from my world.
Let me teach you how to stop him.

264
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:55,292
Yeah, I don't need you
to teach me anything, Jay.

265
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,169
Zoom sent Rothstein here to kill you.

266
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,130
He must've sent Sand Demon here
to do the same thing.

267
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,132
Don't you get it?
Anyone close to the Flash,

268
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,009
all of you, are in a lot of danger!

269
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:08,264
All right. If you were so good,
you would've caught him already.

270
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,351
Let's get Jay back to his cell.

271
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,027
Whoa.

272
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,864
Hey, <i>Beautiful Mind.</i>
I think you need to take a breather.

273
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,115
(SIGHS)

274
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:29,701
After some lengthy calculations,
I believe I have discovered

275
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:33,164
the key to proving
the proposed breach theory.

276
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:34,874
Exotic matter.

277
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:37,126
Huh.

278
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,879
You mean like trans-dimensional energy.

279
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,881
Precisely. Exotic matter,

280
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:45,009
trans-dimensional energy
will theoretically leak

281
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,344
from one universe into another.

282
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:50,181
Now, if this breach
Mr. Garrick is talking about is real,

283
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:55,852
if there is indeed a hole in our universe
which leads to his Earth...

284
00:14:56,062 --> 00:15:00,024
We can make some adjustments and
upload an electrophotography program

285
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:01,233
to the S.T.A.R. Labs' satellite

286
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:04,736
and essentially photograph
the exotic matter leak.

287
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:08,490
Thereby giving us
the locale of said breach.

288
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,742
Last time I saw the kit,
it was in the fabrication room.

289
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:12,036
I shall return.

00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:47,089
That look familiar?

305
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,303
-How about now? What's it look like?
-A fire.

306
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:56,015
There you go, genius. It's the fire
you started in the third ward last night.

307
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,184
Man, I didn't start
no fire there last night.

308
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,769
What, were you out of town?
Your cat get sick?

309
00:17:00,977 --> 00:17:02,354
-(SCOFFS)
-Well, let me guess.

310
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:05,024
You don't start fires anymore.
You've been rehabilitated.

311
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,692
<i>Yeah, I've done it before. So what?</i>

312
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,110
I didn't do this one.

313
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:12,364
I always start a fire
with somethin' that's hard to trace.

314
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,616
You know, like acetone or somethin'.

315
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:18,537
Or maybe you don't need to use
accelerants anymore.

316
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,123
Iron Heights can hold people like you now.
You know that, right?

317
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:23,709
What, you think I'm one of those
meta-human freaks?

318
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:27,213
If I had powers, you don't think
I would've used 'em to get away from you?

319
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,798
-December 2013. Where were you?
-Why?

320
00:17:30,006 --> 00:17:31,675
Answer the damn question. Where were you?

321
00:17:31,883 --> 00:17:33,635
Blackgate Penitentiary.

322
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,012
You don't believe me? Check your records.

323
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:38,182
Jimmy, I need you
to confirm something for me.

324
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:41,393
So, Joe told me what you did.
I'm impressed.

325
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:43,687
(CHUCKLES) Oh, all I did was, you know,

326
00:17:43,895 --> 00:17:45,231
run the other print
from the electrical pipe,

327
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,233
and track Slick down from there.

328
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:48,817
-That's all?
-(LAUGHS)

329
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,569
-Yeah.
-(BOTH LAUGH)

330
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:54,198
How's it going with Joe?
Any closer to cracking his "no" code?

331
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,909
Are you kidding me?
He's like the permission Sphinx.

332
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,746
Or like a magic eight ball
with just one answer.

333
00:18:00,912 --> 00:18:03,665
Or like, you know, the Bridgekeeper
protecting the Holy Grail.

334
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:04,916
What is your quest?

335
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,877
-To join your task force.
-No.

336
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,920
-BOTH: Aah!
-(BOTH LAUGH)

337
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,339
Amazing!

338
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,592
Well, maybe I can
put in a good word for you.

339
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:17,096
That would mean a lot to me, Barry.

340
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,184
-Yeah. (CHUCKLES)
-It's me.

341
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:26,105
Okay, so Slick wasn't in Central City

342
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,357
the night
the particle accelerator exploded.

343
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:29,608
He's lying.

344
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,610
He's a dirt bag and an arsonist,
but he's not lying about this.

345
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,903
He's not a meta, Barry.

346
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,239
Slick is the guy who jumped me.

347
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:38,617
Do you think it's possible
that the Slick in there has a...

348
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,411
A doppelganger?

349
00:18:41,828 --> 00:18:42,913
(SIGHS) I don't know.

352
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,087
Catchy.

353
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:54,133
I hate it
when they put a color in their name.

Yeah, I know. It's not him. I get it.

358

I hate to say it,
I think this Earth Two theory

359
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,603
-is starting to make sense.
-For real?

360
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,689
What, you think Jay is lying
about the Sand Demon?

361
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:13,527
I don't know. That's my point.
But I'm not gonna just believe some guy

362
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:18,031
that walks in here and says a few things
that sort of check out.

00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:20,617
"Sort of?" He was right about Zoom.

364
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,037
We don't even know anything about Zoom.
Or what is Zoom? Is Zoom even real?

365
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,666
Right now, that's just, you know,
a story around a campfire.

I mean, have you discovered a breach yet?

Not yet, but we know how to now.

368

Have you found one thing to suggest
that Jay is a speedster?

369
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,302
Is the speed force even in his system?

370
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,722
It doesn't appear to be, no.

Yes, you. The you that I grew up with.
The you that is my best friend.

The you that became the Flash. I haven't
seen that you in a very long time.

A lot's changed, Iris.

Yeah, it sure has. You have learned
how to not trust people.

It's because he reminds you
of Harrison Wells.

386
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:42,574
I trusted that man. For months.
We all did.

And you know what?
Eddie is dead, Ronnie is dead.

And a whole lot of other people
in this city, they are dead

389
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,425
because we trusted him.

390
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,760
I'm not gonna let us
make that mistake again.

391
00:21:02,969 --> 00:21:07,974
Barry, not everyone is Harrison Wells.

392
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:13,772
Besides, you defeated him
because you trusted in people,

393
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,483
because you believed in them.

394
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:21,447
This team that you have here,
they will follow your lead.

395
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:23,657
They'll do what you say.

396
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:27,453
But if they think
that you don't believe in them,

397
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,289
it won't be long
before they don't believe in you.

You wanna tell me
why you're so hell-bent on being on it?

00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,820
You want to tell me
why you're so hell-bent I'm not?

407
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:09,620
Didn't I just tell you I didn't want
to see your ugly mug around here again?

Well, you're gonna have to,

409
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,541

Finally come to your senses?

414
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:52,370
Sand Demon kidnapped a police officer.
A woman that I know.

415
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,789
And you need my help?

416
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:58,209
I need you to help us
save her before something happens.

anything of the sort.

to fall apart if he becomes dehydrated.

-Like dry sand.
-Exactly.

Sand Demon always attacks on two fronts.

He creates a diversion,
then strikes when you're distracted.

Okay. Then what do we do?

425
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:21,232
We use your speed to get to him
before the distraction can happen.

426

Jay, how do I stop somebody
who can slip through my fingers?

from the energy he creates when he runs.

00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:04,169
You think you were chosen,
the rest of us don't mean anything,

457
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,757
but it's not true. You were just
at the right place at the right time.

458
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,928
Getting those powers
didn't change who you are.

459
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:15,847
They only highlighted the worst parts
of who you already were.

460
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:18,266
Maybe you're right.

461
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:20,351
Maybe not.

462
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:24,856
Either way, you and the Flash are about to
find out what those worst parts are.

(BEEPING)

464
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,655
I've searched all the vacant buildings
in Central City,

465
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,865
and none of them fit the description
that we need.

466
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:36,492
And I've looked at
any draw upticks on the electrical grid.

467
00:25:36,702 --> 00:25:38,620
Nothing out of the norm, I'm afraid.

468
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:41,039
We gotta do whatever it takes.

469
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,542
I'll be back.

470
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,131

Mr. Ramon? What are you doing down here?

479
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:30,255
I figured out where Patty is.

480
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,758
And how, exactly, did you do that?

481
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,593
Just a hunch.

482
00:26:37,428 --> 00:26:38,764
We gotta tell Barry.

(PANTING) I've been doing this
for an hour. It's not working.

487
00:27:03,454 --> 00:27:05,456
It's because you're trying to rush it.

488
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:08,084
This is the one time
when you need to slow down.

489
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,629
Let the energy pass over you,

00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:13,965
then simply direct it
to where you want it to go.

491
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:17,135
All right, Jay, I don't know
if I'm gonna get this in time.

492
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,887
You'll get it. I believe in you.

493
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:24,559
The last person who helped me like this
was a man that I looked up to. Idolized.

494
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:27,437
<i>He taught me how to get faster,
how to get stronger,</i>

That same man murdered my mother.

It's a tough break, but I'm not him.

That's where Slick's keeping Patty.

Dude, great job.

502
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,256
And I was thinking, if I were Sand Demon,

503
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:57,550
and I were attacking a speedster
on two fronts,

504
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,427
I would probably wanna slow you down,

505
00:27:59,635 --> 00:28:03,181
like, by using a concussive bomb,
or something like that.

506
00:28:03,389 --> 00:28:05,851
That's a good thought.
He's actually used one on me before.

507
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,353
His body absorbs the blast,
so it doesn't affect him.

508
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:11,022
Well, kid, you're gonna have to
think of something.

You know what,
what if we give Slick a diversion?

510
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,194
He knows you, right?
You said you went up against him.

511

Yeah, but, Barry, I don't have my speed.

512
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,699
He doesn't know that. You got your suit?

00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,493
Sure. Well, except my helmet.

514
00:28:23,701 --> 00:28:24,745
Helmet?

515
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,747
Silver kettle helmet? Gold wings?

516
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,206

It was my father's,
from the War of the Americas.

Did you just say War of the Americas?

521
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:51,146
I wish you would've just told us
you lost your helmet.

Would've saved us all a headache.

00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,261
Had a lot of practice over the last year.

561
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,226
It was really courageous
doing what you did today.

562

Standing up to the Sand Demon
without any powers.

563

Uh, Barry did all the work.
I just stood there and took a few punches.

It was more than a few.

565
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:27,946
This is a lot harder than I thought.

Losing something that was
such a big part of who I was for so long.

I lost something
that was a part of me, too.

It's hard.

00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,710
But it gets easier every day.

570
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:49,259
You just have to find a new way to live.

571
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:55,556
Just because it's a different life,
it doesn't mean it's a worse one.

And, speed or no speed,
in my book, you are still a hero today.

I'm just sorry
we did not realize it a little bit sooner.

Hey, look, Jay, uh,

582
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,887
so thank you for all your help.

583
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:38,391
And for being so patient with me.

584
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:41,102
Anytime, kid. You're a quick study.

585
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:44,022
Took me a lot longer to learn
how to toss lightning, believe me.

586
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,565
I suppose I had the right teacher.

587

It's gonna be a lot harder
to take down Zoom.

588
00:33:51,487 --> 00:33:52,530
Who is this guy?

589
00:33:52,738 --> 00:33:57,160
No one knows. He showed up around
the same time as when I got my powers.

590
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,454
Killed a lot of people in my world.

591
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:04,500
I spent about two years tracking him down,
but he was too smart.

592
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,712
Too quick. He's always one step ahead.

593
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:12,967
You really think he's just
bringing these guys here to kill me?

594
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:16,804
Zoom was obsessed with destroying me.
Now he wants to destroy you?

595
00:34:17,012 --> 00:34:18,056
Yeah.

596
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:20,225
He needs to be the best.

597
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:25,855
And he will do whatever it takes
to ensure he's the only speedster.

598
00:34:26,897 --> 00:34:27,982

in all this mess because of me.

It's not your fault.

603
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:45,666
Do you really think you have
what it takes to be part of my task force?

604
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,418
I know it, sir.

605
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:50,546
Well, I always check the jacket
of anyone I'm considering for it.

606
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:54,717
In my research on you, I found out
we got a mutual acquaintance.

607
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:56,761
Mark Mardon.

608
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:01,807
I need you to be honest with me here.
Why do you want to do this?

609
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:06,061
Mark Mardon killed my dad.

610
00:35:10,816 --> 00:35:14,069
He had a little shoe shop
down on Chesterfield.

611
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:19,033
It was a cash business,
and one night, he went to Fairfield Bank

612
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:22,578
to make his weekly deposit,
and the Mardon brothers showed up.

613
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:28,876
While he was waiting in line,
Mark shot my dad

614
00:35:29,084 --> 00:35:31,712
in the face for a few hundred dollars.

615
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:36,676
Then, a few months later,
Mark and his brother got powers.

616
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,887
Two murderers got super powers.

617
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:41,847
So that's why I'm here, sir.

618
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:45,226
That's why I'm so hell-bent
on being on your task force.

619
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:51,441
'Cause there's some bad people out there
and they can do anything.

620
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:56,737
And I may not have powers,
but I want to stop them.

621
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:01,534
You're the only person I know
who wants to do that, too.

Monday, 8:00 a.m.

Don't be late.

624
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,465
But, late for what?

628
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:34,859
Hi.

629
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:37,903
Been a long time.

630
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,034
Yeah, it has.

631
00:36:45,911 --> 00:36:47,247
Why are you here?

632
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:51,959
Because you didn't return my calls.
And I wanted to see you.

633
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:55,963
And our daughter.

634
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:05,723
Any progress with the electrophotography?

635
00:37:05,931 --> 00:37:09,227
The satellite picture
of the city's still rendering.

636
00:37:09,935 --> 00:37:13,314
While we wait,
care to tell me what's going on with you?

637
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:14,649
What? Nothing.

638
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,027
Two hunches in one day.

639
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:23,866
Slick's locale and that he'd be using
a concussive bomb to thwart Barry.

640
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:27,119
Do I need to inform you of the odds
of such a prediction?

641
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:34,377
Something's happening to me.
I'm starting to perceive things.

642
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:39,048
Horrible things. It started after
Wells killed me in the other timeline.

643
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:43,719
It came back
when Atom Smasher attacked on Flash Day,

644
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,264
and then again when Sand Demon showed up.

645
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:52,562
I get a vibe, and then a vision
of something that's already happened.

646
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:55,648
And then it's gone.

647
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:59,652
That's how I knew where Slick was.

648
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:04,198
Cisco, this is amazing. We have to
study this. Figure out just what to do to.

649
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,783
No, no, no, we're not doing any of that.

650
00:38:05,991 --> 00:38:07,452
And we're certainly not
telling anybody either.

651
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,579
Cisco, I would think
you'd be the one most intrigued

652
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,206
with knowing exactly what this is
and how it works!

653
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:16,126
I'm seeing things I don't want to see,
and knowing things I don't want to know.

654
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:17,587
I just want it to stop.

655
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:21,048
Professor, I don't want anyone
to know about this.

656
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:22,592
Not yet.

657
00:38:27,012 --> 00:38:28,639
It's okay to be afraid, you know.

658
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:31,684
Wells told me this was in my future,

659
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:35,104
that he gave me this power.

660
00:38:38,023 --> 00:38:40,360
But everything he did was evil.

661
00:38:42,027 --> 00:38:44,279
That's what scares me, Professor.

662
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:49,159
You have to promise me
that you won't tell anyone about this.

663
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:51,787
I promise.

Oh, wow.

666
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,133
It appears that while we were indeed
successful in closing the Singularity,

667
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:07,302
-there was an unfortunate side effect.
-What are you talking about?

668
00:39:07,512 --> 00:39:11,349
Using electrophotography, Cisco and I
were able to search Central City

669
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:15,561
for any signs of energy
entering our Earth from another dimension.

670
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,939
From any breaches,
as Mr. Garrick described them.

671
00:39:19,189 --> 00:39:22,026
But of course,
there isn't just one breach.

672
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:24,737
There's 52 of them,
scattered throughout the city.

673
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:30,451
Uh, these breaches are pockets of time
and space, folded into and upon itself.

674
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:34,539
But the most significant breach of all
appears to be this one.

675
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:39,126
And where exactly is that located?

676
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:42,547
It's here. Inside S.T.A.R. Labs.
