that what crashed

was some sort of

of communication home.

If they have lost their communication

Okay, sir,
I put the helmet on,

95
00:10:50,841 --> 00:10:52,928
and the helmet is, basically,
extreme sunglasses.

96
00:10:53,093 --> 00:10:55,774
And it's some hydration
and some oxygen saturation,

97

and a bunch of other stuff
I don't understand.

But we took Penelope to the beach one
time, which was a terrible idea.

she can't handle the sunlight.

Correct. But I don't think
they can see us, either.

141

Because we are still alive.

I don't need radar.

That's correct.

00:14:41,608 --> 00:14:43,162
HOPPER: It's a buoy.

175
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:47,953
If it gets hit by a wave,
it transmits a signal.

So we can track
without radar.

180

We would practice it
as a contingency plan.

I wish we could
get a hold of Hopper.

00:16:00,852 --> 00:16:02,110
Who's Hopper?

189
00:16:02,187 --> 00:16:03,943
He's a tactical

190
00:16:04,022 --> 00:16:05,861
on an Arleigh Burke
class destroyer.

It has the resources that could
take this entire mountain out.

Great, that makes a lot of sense.
Let's call him.

We can't.
Everything is jammed.

194
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:18,214
They're using an electromagnetic
field to block our signals.

195
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:22,676
It's more like a pulse, it's not a brick wall.
There are gaps, okay?

196

From inside the barrier, we might
just be able to get a call out.

197
00:16:25,335 --> 00:16:27,921
If I could get to my spectrum
analyzer, then, theoretically,

198
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:29,678
we could find a frequency
we could broadcast on...

199

that can make a call?

Yeah.
Get it.

You say that satellite will be

Yeah, that's correct.

The engines haven't been
started in a decade.

but they are steam,

how to fire up.

a user's manual

and six weeks to
go through it all,

381
00:35:04,138 --> 00:35:06,855
we still don't have
enough crew to fire it up.

you're thinking, sir.

to your country,

to ask any more of you,
