1
00:00:03,451 --> 00:00:06,875
I think that in this world,
and in the real medieval world

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,509
marriage was definitely
politics by other means.

3
00:00:10,032 --> 00:00:12,210
It was one of the
prime sources of glue

4
00:00:12,235 --> 00:00:14,856
that held people together
in larger societies.

5
00:00:15,184 --> 00:00:17,197
And one of the
fundamental things

6
00:00:17,198 --> 00:00:19,809
that sets up the whole
drama of our series.

7
00:00:19,834 --> 00:00:23,023
Marriage was a way to
bind two families together.

8
00:00:23,048 --> 00:00:25,624
It was a form of
political alliance.

9
00:00:25,773 --> 00:00:29,639
And royal marriages are one of
the ultimate in examples of this.

11
00:00:34,794 --> 00:00:37,286
The Gods are good

12
00:00:37,777 --> 00:00:41,431
Sir Lorus, I will gladly
wed your sweet sister.

13
00:00:42,306 --> 00:00:44,463
You will be my queen,

14
00:00:44,623 --> 00:00:47,167
and I will love you
from this day,

15
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:49,470
until my last day.

16
00:00:49,495 --> 00:00:50,816
[Cheering and applause]

17
00:00:50,841 --> 00:00:53,992
The real bomb that goes off
in Kings Landing in season 3,

18
00:00:54,017 --> 00:00:56,118
is the arrival of the Tyrells

19
00:00:56,143 --> 00:00:58,445
They're very powerful,
they're very wealthy.

20
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,148
And they control
a lot of cards.

21
00:01:00,173 --> 00:01:02,818
So the family dynamic
between the Lannisters

22
00:01:02,819 --> 00:01:05,035
and the Tyrells,
is quite charged.

23
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,328
Joffrey and Margaery's marriage
had nothing to do with

24
00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:09,657
love or even affection,
it was purely about

25
00:01:09,682 --> 00:01:11,935
stabilising the kingdoms,
and lessens the chance

26
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,229
of some kind of uprising that we
saw start to take place in season 2.

27
00:01:15,866 --> 00:01:17,664
Tell me what you think of her.

28
00:01:17,665 --> 00:01:19,462
With the Tyrells beside us

29
00:01:19,487 --> 00:01:21,487
we'll crush the northerners.

30
00:01:21,806 --> 00:01:24,855
Hang their lords,
burn their strongholds,

31
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,780
sow their fields with salt,

32
00:01:26,805 --> 00:01:30,005
and no one will think of
rebelling for another century.

33
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,025
He's not even thinking
of Margaery as a woman

34
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,415
he's thinking of her as
an abstract principle

35
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,594
that will help further their
families political aim.

36
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:40,978
It just make Tyrons
job much much easier.

37
00:01:41,003 --> 00:01:44,277
The Tyrells allow them to
solidify their hold on the South.

38
00:01:44,402 --> 00:01:47,695
I have seven kingdoms
to look after

39
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,982
and three of them
are in open rebellion.

40
00:01:50,107 --> 00:01:53,845
<i>His prime objective is to ensure
the survival of the Lannisters</i>

41
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,484
and maintain the status quo

42
00:01:56,815 --> 00:01:58,647
and only change it

43
00:01:58,823 --> 00:02:02,030
for the betterment for him and
the rest of the Lannister clan.

44
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:06,472
And the way to ensure your legacy
and so forth is through marriage.

45
00:02:06,844 --> 00:02:09,405
For the Tyrells I think the idea
that their eldest daughter

46
00:02:09,406 --> 00:02:11,537
is going to be queen is
immensely attractive.

47
00:02:11,662 --> 00:02:14,960
Margaerys clearly got a hunger,
and is incredibly ambitious.

48
00:02:14,985 --> 00:02:16,656
Do you want to be a queen?

49
00:02:16,681 --> 00:02:17,752
No.

50
00:02:20,332 --> 00:02:22,132
I want to be <i>the</i> queen.

51
00:02:22,257 --> 00:02:24,485
<i>Margaery knows exactly
how to play the game</i>

52
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,845
<i>better than almost anybody else</i>

53
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,353
She of course is
the granddaughter

54
00:02:27,378 --> 00:02:31,536
<i>of one of the great matriarchs
in our world: Olenna Tyrell.</i>

55
00:02:31,561 --> 00:02:34,391
She is the mother of the present
Lord of Highgarden:

56
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:36,244
Mace Tyrell.

57
00:02:36,269 --> 00:02:39,395
And, she is a very sharp lady.

58
00:02:39,798 --> 00:02:42,094
I want you to tell me the truth,

59
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:43,559
about this royal boy.

60
00:02:43,684 --> 00:02:46,032
We've heard some troubling tales.

61
00:02:46,245 --> 00:02:47,915
Is there any truth to them?

62
00:02:48,641 --> 00:02:50,841
<i>Sansa is an interesting girl</i>

63
00:02:50,864 --> 00:02:52,991
you know shes beautiful

64
00:02:52,992 --> 00:02:55,554
and she comes
from a famous family

65
00:02:55,578 --> 00:02:59,924
and I want to find out about all sorts
of levels of information definitely.

66
00:03:00,149 --> 00:03:03,459
I think they want to get to
the top, by hook or by crook.

67
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:05,044
That's part of the fun, isn’t it.

68
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:08,318
<i>She realises that Sansa
is a very valuable piece</i>

69
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,877
in the Game of Thrones.

70
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:15,046
<i>So far as the realm knows,
Bran and Rickon are dead.</i>

71
00:03:15,271 --> 00:03:16,628
<i>Therefore:</i>

72
00:03:16,653 --> 00:03:21,377
If Robb Stark falls, Sansa Stark
is the key to the North

73
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:24,998
I believe I have a
possible solution.

74
00:03:25,223 --> 00:03:29,717
<i>Their plan is to get
Sansa to marry Sir Loras,</i>

75
00:03:29,742 --> 00:03:31,237
<i>the Knight of Flowers.</i>

76
00:03:31,262 --> 00:03:34,614
<i>But there are a lot of spies,
there are a lot of listening ears so...</i>

77
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,898
before they can really
put their plan in motion

78
00:03:36,923 --> 00:03:39,201
the Lannisters get wind of this.

79
00:03:39,226 --> 00:03:43,046
We need to act first and
kill this union in it's crib.

80
00:03:43,047 --> 00:03:44,452
And how do we do that?

81
00:03:44,453 --> 00:03:46,763
We find Sansa Stark
a different husband.

82
00:03:46,788 --> 00:03:49,443
- Wonderful
- Yes, it is.

83
00:03:49,668 --> 00:03:51,702
Tyrion is in love with
Shae at this moment

84
00:03:51,727 --> 00:03:53,305
but he's forced
into this marriage

85
00:03:54,196 --> 00:03:56,396
that I really don't
want to be a part of.

86
00:03:56,521 --> 00:03:59,606
But at least if he marries
Sansa he can protect her.

87
00:03:59,631 --> 00:04:01,331
Especially from Joffrey.

88
00:04:01,456 --> 00:04:04,525
All you have to do is get
a son in the Stark girl.

89
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,418
He'll be Lord
of Winterfell one day.

90
00:04:06,443 --> 00:04:08,644
You can rule the North
in his name.

91
00:04:08,669 --> 00:04:11,469
You'll have two women and a
whole kingdom of your own.

92
00:04:12,194 --> 00:04:15,474
And then, Tyron turns the
tables onto Cersei and says

93
00:04:15,499 --> 00:04:17,543
and says she has an
arranged marriage as well.

94
00:04:17,763 --> 00:04:19,931
I am Queen Regent,
not some broodmare.

95
00:04:19,956 --> 00:04:22,425
You're my daughter!

96
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,330
You will do as I command

97
00:04:24,355 --> 00:04:26,590
and you will marry Loras Tyrell

98
00:04:26,615 --> 00:04:28,950
and put an end
to the disgusting rumors

99
00:04:28,975 --> 00:04:31,775
about you, once and for all.

100
00:04:32,743 --> 00:04:34,624
My children.

101
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,171
<i>Now the Lannisters</i>

102
00:04:36,196 --> 00:04:38,391
<i>will control the South
as well as the North.</i>

103
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:41,886
<i>As well as the Iron Throne, it's all
for the glory of House Lannister.</i>

104
00:04:43,344 --> 00:04:46,947
My mother always told me
you Westerosi were a grim lot.

105
00:04:48,137 --> 00:04:50,814
Grim, stinking barbarians

106
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,249
that would row
across the Narrow Sea

107
00:04:53,274 --> 00:04:55,874
and steal us from our beds.

108
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:58,086
Did you ever think
you'd marry one?

109
00:04:58,111 --> 00:05:00,838
<i>When we first meet
Robb Stark in season 3</i>

110
00:05:00,863 --> 00:05:02,880
the tables have
changed somewhat.

111
00:05:02,905 --> 00:05:06,483
<i>Robb is in a very difficult position
he was engaged to one of the Frays</i>

112
00:05:06,508 --> 00:05:10,018
<i>but he's followed his heart not
his head, he married Talisa.</i>

113
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:11,710
<i>And by breaking his vow</i>

114
00:05:11,735 --> 00:05:14,572
he's angered a once
very powerful ally.

115
00:05:15,197 --> 00:05:17,564
If I had the sense
the Gods gave a fish,

116
00:05:17,589 --> 00:05:19,639
I'd hand you both
over to the Lannisters.

117
00:05:19,664 --> 00:05:22,476
- Why don't you?
- Stark, Tully,

118
00:05:22,501 --> 00:05:24,801
Lannister, Baratheon,

119
00:05:25,266 --> 00:05:27,266
give me one good reason

120
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:30,091
why I should waste
a single thought on any of you?

121
00:05:30,116 --> 00:05:32,730
Walder Fray could have remained
neutral in this conflict and

122
00:05:32,755 --> 00:05:34,172
that had it's own risks,

123
00:05:34,197 --> 00:05:36,083
but he saw an opportunity to

124
00:05:36,108 --> 00:05:39,640
vastly enhance the *** of
House Frey, and he took it.

125
00:05:39,665 --> 00:05:42,396
So now what he
cares about is

126
00:05:42,421 --> 00:05:45,577
the political contract
that was violated.

127
00:05:45,702 --> 00:05:46,957
This is not a world where

128
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:50,252
the idea of marrying for love
makes any sense to anybody.

129
00:05:50,777 --> 00:05:53,288
<i>Cat has this
instinctive feeling.</i>

130
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:57,854
<i>Talisa is the catalyst that
starts the demise almost.</i>

131
00:05:57,879 --> 00:06:00,136
For a king to break his word

132
00:06:00,161 --> 00:06:03,131
is something that she just
can not really accept.

133
00:06:03,156 --> 00:06:06,252
Because in this world,
nothing goes unanswered

134
00:06:06,483 --> 00:06:09,793
Walder Fray is a
dangerous man to cross.

135
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,917
- You arranged it.
- And you agreed to it.

136
00:06:14,355 --> 00:06:16,355
You gave him your word.

137
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,091
Treat your oaths recklessly and
your people will do the same.

138
00:06:20,116 --> 00:06:23,354
The decision to marry Talisa
definitely divided Robb's bannermen

139
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:25,596
they're gonna be
the people who say

140
00:06:25,621 --> 00:06:27,255
I pledge my allegiance
to this person

141
00:06:27,256 --> 00:06:29,183
and I'm gonna stick with
him, no matter what.

142
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,926
They're also gonna be the
people who wonder maybe

143
00:06:31,951 --> 00:06:35,165
I need to reassess who
he is, as a leader.

144
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,103
Yo don't think we can win.

145
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:40,485
I think you lost this war

146
00:06:41,013 --> 00:06:43,317
the day you married her!

147
00:06:44,022 --> 00:06:46,595
After Robb married Talisa

148
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,711
I think things changed,
we lost some of

149
00:06:48,736 --> 00:06:51,136
our men, my army are
angered at that,

150
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:55,190
and it's the one dishonorable thing
that I feel Robb has done since...

151
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:56,540
since we've got to know him.

152
00:06:56,765 --> 00:06:59,865
I need men to replace the
Karstarks who marched home.

153
00:07:00,495 --> 00:07:02,468
There is only one person
in this kingdom

154
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:05,669
with that kind of army who hasn't
already sided with the Lannisters.

155
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:09,819
The man whose daughter
I was supposed to marry--

156
00:07:10,838 --> 00:07:12,538
Walder Frey.

157
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:16,147
Robb not only deprived Walder of
his chance to see his daughter

158
00:07:16,148 --> 00:07:18,348
as queen but also, Walder still

159
00:07:18,373 --> 00:07:21,134
guilty of rebelling against
Tywin in the Iron Throne.

160
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:23,649
And that puts Walder Frey
and his entire family at risk

161
00:07:23,874 --> 00:07:25,333
So something that
Robb has to try to do

162
00:07:25,358 --> 00:07:28,364
is mend a lot of broken bridges
and see if he can the damage

163
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,833
that he's done by a
lot of bad decisions

164
00:07:31,058 --> 00:07:34,218
We will do whatever we can to
give Lord Frey what he needs.

165
00:07:34,243 --> 00:07:36,043
Not what--

166
00:07:36,068 --> 00:07:37,368
whom.

167
00:07:38,818 --> 00:07:41,053
Our father requires
Lord Edmure to wed

168
00:07:41,078 --> 00:07:42,612
one of his daughters.

169
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,914
He was due a King

170
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:46,661
to marry one of his
daughters to and...

171
00:07:46,686 --> 00:07:49,010
Edmure Tully, while he is the

172
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:52,355
important person in his
own right and is the air of

173
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,633
the Tully household.

174
00:07:53,658 --> 00:07:57,176
It's still kind of the door prize
in the political marriage race.

175
00:07:58,085 --> 00:08:00,485
I've won every battle,

176
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,510
but I'm losing this war.

177
00:08:03,961 --> 00:08:07,161
If we don't do this
and do it now,

178
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:09,086
we're lost.

179
00:08:09,111 --> 00:08:11,495
It's something you see time
and again in Game of Thrones

180
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,800
is characters who kind of
casting off their allusions and

181
00:08:14,825 --> 00:08:17,128
learning what it means to
rule and to seize power

182
00:08:17,153 --> 00:08:19,735
and the truth is, all these
families see it as a tool so

183
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,222
whether it's the Tyrells
marrying Margaery to Joffrey,

184
00:08:22,247 --> 00:08:25,531
or Tywin trying to figure out
how to insure his legacy by

185
00:08:25,556 --> 00:08:28,391
marrying Tyrion to Sansa
and Cersei to Lorus.

186
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:32,096
Marriage is one of the main
tools of political maneuvering and

187
00:08:32,121 --> 00:08:34,221
we're gonna see it again
and again in this world.

188
00:08:34,546 --> 00:08:39,546
