1
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:35,928
You ready?

2
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:04,759
- How am I doing?
- Sure you want to know?

3
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:08,362
"Does your boyfriend
always get his way?"

4
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:09,864
Yes.

5
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:13,067
"Does he admit when he's wrong?"

6
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:15,236
Never.

7
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:17,655
Does your boyfriend know
how to build a fire with no matches?

8
00:02:17,755 --> 00:02:20,107
Answer is D, who cares.

9
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:23,878
- A, yes. Very well.
- Sorry, that question's not on here.

10
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:27,046
- It should be in there.
- Sorry. So you're still zero.

11
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:51,671
- No!
- Yeah!

12
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:57,269
<i>Never put your hat on the bed, son
Never put your hat on the bed</i>

13
00:02:57,369 --> 00:02:59,701
<i>Cuz if your hat's on the bed
You might wake up dead</i>

14
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:02,631
<i>So don't you never put your hat
on the bed</i>

15
00:03:02,731 --> 00:03:07,237
<i>Always keep an edge on your knife, son
Always keep an edge on your knife</i>

16
00:03:07,337 --> 00:03:09,896
<i>Cuz a good sharp edge
Is a man's best hedge</i>

17
00:03:09,996 --> 00:03:12,315
<i>Against the vague uncertainties of life</i>

18
00:03:12,415 --> 00:03:14,613
<i>Yes, a good sharp edge
Is a man's best hedge</i>

19
00:03:14,713 --> 00:03:16,464
<i>Against the uncertain vagaries of life</i>

20
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:19,633
- Get your hands on the wheel.
- <i>But I never could sharpen no knife</i>

21
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:22,105
<i>Like the one give the advice</i>

22
00:03:22,205 --> 00:03:26,535
<i>Yodel-aye, yodel-aye, yodel-ooh</i>

23
00:03:27,405 --> 00:03:29,363
<i>Never sell the old .22...</i>

24
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,221
- Hello?
- Hey.

25
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:17,021
- Just give me a second, will you?
- Yeah, sure.

26
00:04:17,121 --> 00:04:19,193
- How you doin'?
- Good, good, good.

27
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:21,062
We're reserved under Louis.

28
00:04:21,162 --> 00:04:23,695
- What's the name?
- Alex Louis.

29
00:04:25,532 --> 00:04:27,902
Yeah, sign in here. You're ready to go.

30
00:04:28,002 --> 00:04:30,504
Your canoe will be
right down there by the water.

31
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:34,241
- Bring it back Monday at five.
- That's right, back to work Tuesday.

32
00:04:34,341 --> 00:04:37,308
- Need a map?
- No, I'm good.

33
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:41,105
- You don't want a map?
- No. No. I know this park well.

34
00:04:41,205 --> 00:04:43,184
It's kinda end of the season, right?

35
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:46,412
I mean, the weather can change on you...
just turn on a dime.

36
00:04:46,512 --> 00:04:49,590
- Less people.
- Amen to that.

37
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,411
You mind me askin' you, Mr. No Map,
where you're headed?

38
00:04:53,511 --> 00:04:56,130
Blackfoot Trail.
I can't wait to show her.

39
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,066
It's her first time here.
It's gonna be awesome.

40
00:04:58,766 --> 00:05:00,868
I got some bad news for you,
I'm really sorry about this

41
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:02,920
but Blackfoot Trail's
closed for the season.

42
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,605
- Why?
- Had to.

43
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:07,035
I mean, so many yahoos, you know,

44
00:05:07,135 --> 00:05:11,211
trampin' around there, disrespecting
everything. This is a treasured site.

45
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:15,616
I don't have to tell you I guess. And Parks
and Recreation want to keep it that way.

46
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:19,854
Look, going to Blackfoot Trail
is kinda the whole point of this trip.

47
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:23,791
It's 500 bucks
if you're caught up there. Each.

48
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:27,725
That'll be a 1000 bucks
expensive little camping trip.

49
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,231
Alright.

50
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:32,306
- Jenn, you ready?
- Yeah.

51
00:05:32,406 --> 00:05:36,777
Hang on. Hey, rodeo, here's your
medical kit and there's a whistle in there,

52
00:05:36,877 --> 00:05:39,941
try to bring that back
and I'll try not to charge you.

53
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:42,525
Thousand bucks?

54
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,876
You're pretty good.

55
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:50,448
- Bye. You have a nice trip.
- Thanks.

56
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:11,438
- Really?
- Last one.

57
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:13,741
- Come on, babe.
- No, this is really important.

58
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:17,778
You know, we've been waiting
forever for this. I'm... just...

59
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:20,779
They're all important.
Can't wait till we get back?

60
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,694
Okay, I'm done. Okay?

61
00:06:24,794 --> 00:06:27,549
- Alright. I don't believe you, but...
- Well, putting it away, so it's...

62
00:06:27,649 --> 00:06:31,025
Hang on, hang on. Let's take a picture.
Just to mark the departure.

63
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:34,692
- Put it to good use, right?
- Fine. Okay.

64
00:06:34,992 --> 00:06:37,030
Ready?

65
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,999
- Good.
- Yeah. One of us looks good.

66
00:06:44,099 --> 00:06:46,170
Alright.

67
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:26,478
- Hey, have a good one.
- Thanks a lot.

68
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,456
- Fuck!
- You okay?

69
00:08:42,556 --> 00:08:45,859
Fuck, fuck that...
fuckin' hurt like a bitch.

70
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,029
You sure you're okay?

71
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:51,163
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I'll just walk it off.

72
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,500
This is for you.

73
00:08:56,736 --> 00:09:00,492
You look scared anyway. Feel safe.

74
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:03,207
I probably won't need it.

75
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:06,458
Got it taken care of already.

76
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,895
- Look what I got.
- When did you get that?

77
00:09:12,995 --> 00:09:15,956
- I got it a few days ago.
- You're not gonna need it.

78
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:18,729
Do you wanna have a good time on this trip
or do you want me to be freaking out?

79
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,596
- This is what makes me feel safe.
- Okay. Okay.

80
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:26,867
Well, if you can have it, it's useless
in your bag. Give it to me. Thanks.

81
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:29,536
Just gonna clip it
to your belt, alright?

82
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:32,170
And you're not gonna need it.

83
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:35,139
Bear spray.

84
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:37,711
Wonder what other goodies
you have in there.

85
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:38,913
- Nothin'.
- Let's see.

86
00:09:39,013 --> 00:09:42,247
I don't have anything in there.
Hey, there's nothing.

87
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:45,519
- Come on.
- What?

88
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:49,457
- Seriously? This is a road flare.
- I know what it is.

89
00:09:49,557 --> 00:09:52,725
Yeah. This is for when your car
breaks down on the side of the highway.

90
00:09:52,825 --> 00:09:55,562
You know this. I know you know this.

91
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:57,898
Jenn, come on, if you wanted a flare,
I could've picked up a pen flare.

92
00:09:57,998 --> 00:10:00,831
They sell them at any camping store.

93
00:10:02,902 --> 00:10:05,603
- Here's your flare.
- Thank you.

94
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,710
- You ready?
- Think so.

95
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,843
Okay.

96
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,196
Oh, my God.

97
00:10:19,185 --> 00:10:21,227
- You good?
- Yes.

98
00:10:46,745 --> 00:10:49,116
What, sorry, what?

99
00:10:50,868 --> 00:10:54,718
Jenn, you know we'd be lucky to see
anything bigger than a chipmunk, right?

100
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:19,110
- Hi.
- Hey.

101
00:11:43,131 --> 00:11:44,968
No!

102
00:11:48,908 --> 00:11:51,679
Hey, look at that. That's cute.

103
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:53,647
We should take it.

104
00:11:53,747 --> 00:11:56,280
- Here's a good spot.
- Yeah.

105
00:11:58,852 --> 00:12:01,085
Counselor, back up, please.

106
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:22,009
- Tryin' to turn me on right now?
- Is it working?

107
00:12:22,109 --> 00:12:25,376
Oh, yeah. It's pretty hot.

108
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,979
Speaking of...

109
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,270
do you remember the little
swimming hole we walked by?

110
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:37,688
- Nope, I don't. No.
- Really?

111
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,527
- You said you would.
- I didn't say that.

112
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:42,245
- Yes, you did.
- I said maybe.

113
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:45,633
No, no, no. You said yes.
Come on, babes.

114
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:49,069
No. It's like when you say, "Do you
want to order Chinese food tonight?"

115
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:52,306
And I go, "Maybe,"
and then we get Italian.

116
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:53,807
It's like that.

117
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:57,327
- I'm gonna be all lonely by myself.
- Well, no one's making you do this.

118
00:12:57,427 --> 00:12:58,910
Stop it!

119
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:06,450
Oh, my God, please. What if there's...

120
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,587
Don't leave me hangin', babe.

121
00:13:11,857 --> 00:13:14,391
Okay, okay. Fine.

122
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:29,976
- You ready?
- No.

123
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:32,128
Come on.

124
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:40,519
5... 4... 3, 2, 1!

125
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,268
- Jenn, come on!
- No!

126
00:13:49,368 --> 00:13:51,364
It's freezing.

127
00:14:01,641 --> 00:14:03,944
I'm gonna get some more wood
before it gets too dark.

128
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:07,714
- Okay, I'll come help you.
- No, no, I'll be back in a second.

129
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:10,247
Okay. Yeah.

130
00:14:52,858 --> 00:14:54,219
Hello.

131
00:15:15,114 --> 00:15:17,272
How long have you been...

132
00:15:17,372 --> 00:15:19,583
At this time...

133
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:22,920
- What?
- No, I mean...

134
00:15:27,734 --> 00:15:29,956
- Really?
- Yeah.

135
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:48,882
Hey. This is Alex. Alex this is Brad.

136
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:51,184
- Brad, right?
- Yeah. Hi, how are you?

137
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,650
I'm good. Thanks.

138
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:57,089
- Were you just walkin' by or...
- Oh, yeah, I was comin' up the trail

139
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:59,860
and I ran into your friend here
and she invited me over for a chat.

140
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:03,997
Yeah. Turns out that he also
kind of grew up in a park, the woods.

141
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:07,718
And he's got a ton of fish so I thought
maybe we could all have dinner tonight.

142
00:16:07,818 --> 00:16:11,872
Couldn't eat 'em all if I wanted to.
I mean, I could try, but...

143
00:16:11,972 --> 00:16:13,874
I just gotta put a shirt on, alright?

144
00:16:13,974 --> 00:16:16,373
- Okay.
- Yeah.

145
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:19,443
So you were sayin'...

146
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,454
- Jenn?
- Yeah?

147
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:31,154
- Would you come help me here for a sec?
- Sure.

148
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:36,196
- What's up?
- Come on in.

149
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:38,362
Okay.

150
00:16:40,065 --> 00:16:43,503
- What's goin' on?
- You comfortable with this?

151
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:47,541
- What? Him?
- Yeah, I don't know, this guy could be...

152
00:16:47,641 --> 00:16:50,043
I was talkin' to him for, like,
10 minutes. He's great.

153
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:53,526
- He's great. Well, he's a liar.
- Why is he a liar?

154
00:16:53,626 --> 00:16:56,010
Woods? What, the woods of Ireland?

155
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,896
- Come on, come on.
- What does that have to do with anything?

156
00:17:00,621 --> 00:17:02,159
Did you invite him
or he invited himself?

157
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:04,254
I did.

158
00:17:06,527 --> 00:17:08,964
- You want me to uninvite him?
- No, we can't do that.

159
00:17:09,064 --> 00:17:13,162
- I can do that. It'd be really awkward.
- You'd never be able to do that. I know you.

160
00:17:13,734 --> 00:17:16,970
- What do you need help with?
- I obviously don't need help.

161
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:20,627
I guess it wasn't obvious because...
you told me to come in here.

162
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:25,312
You know, I don't wanna
bother you all, so...

163
00:17:25,412 --> 00:17:28,181
Probably better if I just be
on my way and... have a nice trip.

164
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:31,284
- No, no, no. Stay.
- No, no, no. You're gonna stay...

165
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,586
and you're gonna have
some dinner with us.

166
00:17:33,686 --> 00:17:34,855
- Yeah?
- Of course.

167
00:17:34,955 --> 00:17:38,322
It was just... it was just
a misunderstanding, that's all.

168
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,386
Well, alright, then. Let's do it.

169
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:03,965
You wanted fish.

170
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,251
I thought it was illegal
to fish these lakes.

171
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:17,230
Grandfather law.

172
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:21,168
So that's when... like an old law
applies to existing situations

173
00:18:21,268 --> 00:18:23,303
but then a new one
applies to all the future ones?

174
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:27,474
- I know what a grandfather law is.
- Okay. Sorry.

175
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:30,783
- Lawyer.
- Yeah, I got that.

176
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:36,648
What about you, Alex? What do you do?

177
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:40,620
Well... right now I'm...

178
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,392
My buddy has a landscaping business
so I'm... I'm working with him.

179
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:47,792
Are you Mexican?

180
00:18:47,892 --> 00:18:49,730
I didn't mean anything by that.

181
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:53,333
I just thought that's a job
that the Mexicans do here.

182
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:55,402
Well, what he does is pretty high end.

183
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:58,605
And actually he's starting
a new company soon, so...

184
00:18:58,705 --> 00:19:01,174
It's great. He's really talented.

185
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:03,950
Well done you, Alex.

186
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:11,318
- Trout looks good.
- It does, right?

187
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:16,256
Yeah, and lucky for me if I cannot find
any fish I got a license to kill a deer.

188
00:19:16,356 --> 00:19:17,336
Oh, cool.

189
00:19:17,436 --> 00:19:21,094
Fuck me tryin' to get a license
for that these days.

190
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:23,630
You guys have anything
we can cook for sides with these?

191
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,913
Yeah, you know, I could...

192
00:19:26,013 --> 00:19:29,516
- Maybe fry the veggies or potatoes?
- Yeah, veggies sound good.

193
00:19:29,616 --> 00:19:32,139
- Okay.
- Well, I say the potatoes.

194
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:34,641
Why don't we do both?

195
00:19:34,741 --> 00:19:36,977
You know, Alex...

196
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:39,654
let's eat the potatoes.

197
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:42,905
I'll get 'em.

198
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:54,361
So you're Irish?

199
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:58,198
- County Tipperary.
- Is that near Mexico?

200
00:19:58,298 --> 00:20:01,868
That's a good one.
Actually south of Dublin.

201
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:04,571
What do you do for a livin' out here?

202
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:08,608
I give backcountry Eco tours
to tourists that want...

203
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,779
you know, like a deeper experience
of the wilderness you know,

204
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:14,226
somethin' more than campin'
in a parking lot.

205
00:20:14,326 --> 00:20:15,532
Yeah? That's cool.

206
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:19,353
I mean, you and Jenn are doin' it
so it must be cool, right?

207
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:21,798
How much would somethin' like that cost?

208
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,089
I wouldn't know.

209
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:29,118
You don't know how much it costs?

210
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:34,965
I only know how much they pay me, Alex.

211
00:20:41,264 --> 00:20:45,553
Okay, so they're already parboiled, we just
need to put 'em on for a few minutes.

212
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:48,005
Hang on.

213
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,702
Oh, my...

214
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,463
I'm sorry.

215
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:09,790
Alright, then.
Let's see what we've got here.

216
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:14,170
- I can do that.
- No, I got it.

217
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,576
This smells delicious.

218
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:21,048
Yeah. There's, garlic, rosemary
and there's some thyme.

219
00:21:21,648 --> 00:21:25,184
- You're a luck man, Alex.
- I know.

220
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:27,420
So what are your plans?

221
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,590
You guys gonna do some amazing hikes,
see some spots, what?

222
00:21:30,855 --> 00:21:34,027
- I think we can...
- You know, we live really hectic lives

223
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:37,998
so I think we're just gonna... relax.
Stay around here for a few days.

224
00:21:38,298 --> 00:21:41,001
- Yep.
- Alright.

225
00:21:41,101 --> 00:21:44,335
You're really grabbin' life
by the balls, Alex, aren't ya?

226
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:47,793
I'm just sayin'.

227
00:21:47,893 --> 00:21:51,178
You know, if... if I had a beautiful
woman here like Jenn, I'd...

228
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:55,782
wanna take her to some spots that
weren't on the... the tourist trail, right?

229
00:21:55,882 --> 00:21:57,717
As a matter of fact, Jenn...

230
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:02,856
there is this absolutely gorgeous
waterfall, I mean, really beautiful.

231
00:22:02,956 --> 00:22:05,926
- You've probably been there, right, Alex?
- Yeah, totally.

232
00:22:06,026 --> 00:22:10,263
Then you know which side
of the waterfall to climb down on.

233
00:22:10,863 --> 00:22:13,177
The right side.

234
00:22:14,533 --> 00:22:16,624
Right side.

235
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:21,701
- Good guess, Alex.
- I wasn't guessing.

236
00:22:21,801 --> 00:22:24,511
You see these tourists are always
tryin' to go down the left side.

237
00:22:24,611 --> 00:22:27,380
I mean, they think it's safer.
Fuckin' idiots!

238
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,516
There's also a...

239
00:22:29,616 --> 00:22:32,018
it's frozen... frozen arrow.

240
00:22:32,118 --> 00:22:34,587
In Blackfoot Trail.

241
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,757
I mean, if it were me...

242
00:22:37,257 --> 00:22:40,460
I'd want to take you to all those spots.

243
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,229
You sure you don't need a guide?

244
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:45,912
I already have one.

245
00:22:46,331 --> 00:22:48,355
Let's eat.

246
00:23:06,288 --> 00:23:08,181
Alright.

247
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:11,993
- That was fun.
- Yeah, thanks for the fish.

248
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:17,964
Alright.

249
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:20,733
Well, now, I'm ready. Cheers.

250
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:23,102
Goodnight.

251
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:25,637
Say, Alex...

252
00:23:25,837 --> 00:23:28,074
you know, earlier...

253
00:23:28,174 --> 00:23:30,343
you said something.

254
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:32,887
It was a misunderstanding.

255
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:36,448
You wanna explain that to me?

256
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,485
- It was nothing.
- Come on, he's a big boy.

257
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:41,754
Let him answer.

258
00:23:41,854 --> 00:23:44,624
It's just a funny thing to say.

259
00:23:44,724 --> 00:23:46,292
What'd you mean by it?

260
00:23:46,392 --> 00:23:48,561
I'm not sure I understand
what you're getting at.

261
00:23:48,661 --> 00:23:51,328
Oh, yes, you do.

262
00:23:51,863 --> 00:23:56,082
What... was the misunderstanding?

263
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,744
Is it important?

264
00:24:04,844 --> 00:24:06,746
I won't be fuckin' askin' if it wasn't.

265
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:09,313
- It's on me, okay. I was just...
- Jenn.

266
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:17,657
Well, I come back here...

267
00:24:17,757 --> 00:24:20,982
and I find my girlfriend
talkin' to this guy...

268
00:24:22,027 --> 00:24:24,299
and I'm not sure it's a good idea.

269
00:24:27,292 --> 00:24:29,302
That's all.

270
00:24:29,402 --> 00:24:32,067
I mean, I don't know you.

271
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:35,666
So what was the misunderstanding?

272
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:42,082
You can be some nut.

273
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:45,765
She convinced me otherwise.

274
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:52,315
Like I said, Alex...

275
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:58,274
you're a lucky guy.

276
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:03,336
I'm sorry.

277
00:25:03,436 --> 00:25:05,541
Jenn, I...

278
00:25:06,138 --> 00:25:08,554
- I think you dropped something.
- I got it.

279
00:25:11,209 --> 00:25:13,276
Thanks.

280
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,592
Why don't you invite him to the house
next time. That'd be fun.

281
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:29,276
I said I'm sorry.

282
00:25:30,796 --> 00:25:32,999
- Should we worry about him?
- What's that?

283
00:25:33,099 --> 00:25:37,003
Should we worry about him
comin' back, or I don't know...

284
00:25:37,515 --> 00:25:40,470
No, he's just... he's just weird.

285
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:45,994
But I'm bringing my axe.
And I'm gonna sleep with it

286
00:25:46,094 --> 00:25:50,816
in case your fuckin' dinner guest wants
to come back for... dessert or something.

287
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:53,349
You're mad.

288
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:58,424
- Jenn, I don't understand you.
- What?

289
00:25:58,524 --> 00:26:02,729
You invite a total stranger to eat dinner
with us our first night on this trip.

290
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:06,599
Okay, I... I didn't know what to do.

291
00:26:06,699 --> 00:26:09,942
I was just being kind.

292
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,672
I'm sorry.

293
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:17,075
Just stay here. If he turns around
and comes back, you yell for me.

294
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:58,184
Oh, my God.

295
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:00,856
That smells amazing.

296
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,572
Thank you.

297
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:10,530
Remember the survey that we took
on the way over here?

298
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,135
The first question was about...

299
00:27:12,235 --> 00:27:15,034
how many times your boyfriend
has made breakfast in bed for you?

300
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:16,335
- Remember that?
- Really?

301
00:27:16,435 --> 00:27:20,040
Yeah, and I had to write zero. I guess
I'll have to change that from zero to one.

302
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,041
One?

303
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:24,611
- Was it really zero?
- Yeah.

304
00:27:24,711 --> 00:27:26,446
- You embarrassed?
- Little bit.

305
00:27:26,546 --> 00:27:29,813
- This isn't even in bed...
- Believe me this counts.

306
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:34,000
Thank you.

307
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:39,792
What is it about this place
that's so amazing?

308
00:27:39,892 --> 00:27:43,729
- Blackfoot Trail?
- Yeah. Why's it called that anyway?

309
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,898
The local tribes called it that
because when the trail ends

310
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:50,636
it circles around this really small lake.
And the earth around the lake is black.

311
00:27:50,736 --> 00:27:53,114
So when they hunted they followed
animal tracks in the black earth

312
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:55,141
and called it Blackfoot Trail.

313
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:58,210
So what's the lake called?

314
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,646
- I don't know.
- Seriously?

315
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:03,283
No, no, no, picture it,
picture it, picture it, alright?

316
00:28:03,383 --> 00:28:05,585
You come up this steep rocky trail

317
00:28:05,685 --> 00:28:10,990
and then all of a sudden it levels off
and it's this beautiful, pristine lake.

318
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:15,395
When I was a kid this was my favorite
place in the whole world.

319
00:28:15,995 --> 00:28:17,697
Now it looks so out of place
that high up.

320
00:28:17,797 --> 00:28:21,100
It's like out of some fantasy novel
or something, you know.

321
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,503
Yeah, I have a feeling your geeky side
is about to come out.

322
00:28:23,603 --> 00:28:25,305
- What geeky side?
- What geeky side?

323
00:28:25,405 --> 00:28:27,607
The one that made me watch
"Legend" four times.

324
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:29,776
"Just wait for the part where Tom Cruise
is waiting by the lake

325
00:28:29,876 --> 00:28:31,144
for the big white unicorn to come out."

326
00:28:31,244 --> 00:28:33,045
It's an awesome scene.
What are you talking about?

327
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:35,890
Yeah, indeed.

328
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,424
All good?

329
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:47,021
Yeah.

330
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:04,310
Of course, you're going that way.

331
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,643
This is the way.

332
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:01,237
Fuck.

333
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:54,596
Fuck.

334
00:31:00,927 --> 00:31:02,920
Let me see it.

335
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:10,233
Alex, it's disgusting.

336
00:31:12,838 --> 00:31:15,397
It's pretty bad.

337
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:35,815
- Oh, fuck!
- Are you ready?

338
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,581
Sorry.

339
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,804
That's not good.

340
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:49,706
- To think you're laughing about it.
- Oh, why not?

341
00:31:52,878 --> 00:31:56,348
Just don't touch the toe. Don't touch...
Here, let me... let me finish it.

342
00:31:56,448 --> 00:31:59,086
- It looks... it looks okay.
- It looks terrible.

343
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:04,487
- What you got there?
- You could use some new socks.

344
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:08,858
- Stupid place.
- Oh, thanks, babes.

345
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:11,193
Okay.

346
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,087
Alex.

347
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:13,389
Alex.

348
00:33:22,868 --> 00:33:25,970
Alex. Alex.

349
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:29,175
Alex, get up. Listen.

350
00:33:29,275 --> 00:33:31,410
- What?
- Just listen. What is that?

351
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,609
What?

352
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:37,983
- Someone's throwing shit at our tent.
- What?

353
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:40,486
Just listen.

354
00:33:40,586 --> 00:33:43,489
- What is that?
- That?

355
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:45,224
Oh, that's acorns.

356
00:33:45,324 --> 00:33:50,093
Just fallin' from the trees on our tent.
It's fine. Just go back to sleep.

357
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:04,601
That's not an acorn.

358
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,748
What is it?

359
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:14,639
- Do you think it's him?
- Let's just listen for a bit, okay?

360
00:34:29,268 --> 00:34:31,170
Fuck! I swear,
now you got me all paranoid.

361
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:33,739
Maybe he came back. He's throwing stones
at the tent or something stupid.

362
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,582
No, no, no, it could be anything.

363
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:44,413
Whatever it is, it stopped.

364
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:49,358
So, let's just go back to sleep,
okay? It's fine.

365
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:51,721
It stopped.

366
00:35:46,211 --> 00:35:48,847
That wasn't there last night, was it?

367
00:35:48,947 --> 00:35:50,650
No.

368
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:53,585
I wanna go home.
I don't wanna be here anymore.

369
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:57,937
- Jenn, come on, don't overreact, okay?
- An acorn did that?

370
00:35:59,425 --> 00:36:03,028
Come on, I've waited
so long for this trip.

371
00:36:03,128 --> 00:36:06,719
We're here and when you get there,

372
00:36:06,819 --> 00:36:09,062
you'll love it.

373
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:12,690
I promise.

374
00:36:14,171 --> 00:36:16,041
Yeah, okay.

375
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:18,478
- Can you do this for me?
- Yes.

376
00:36:19,178 --> 00:36:22,213
- Thank you.
- Alright.

377
00:36:27,353 --> 00:36:30,923
She's a very good artist. I have no idea
why you don't give her a chance.

378
00:36:31,023 --> 00:36:33,225
- What do you mean?
- And she's a great performer.

379
00:36:33,325 --> 00:36:35,361
You know, it's just not my thing.

380
00:36:35,461 --> 00:36:37,596
- I don't...
- Oh, hey.

381
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:39,989
Hang on a second.

382
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:44,632
What?

383
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,329
This is wintergreen.

384
00:36:52,978 --> 00:36:55,381
And you can eat this.

385
00:36:58,548 --> 00:37:00,085
Tastes like spearmint gum.

386
00:37:00,185 --> 00:37:01,020
- You want some?
- No.

387
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:04,453
- You sure?
- Yes. An animal probably peed on it.

388
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:07,156
Your loss.

389
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,694
What's that smell?

390
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,207
It's nothin'.

391
00:37:34,352 --> 00:37:35,355
Babe.

392
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,843
Oh, my God. Alex!

393
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,743
I mean, what...

394
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:10,686
No.

395
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:51,994
Oh, God. Get off me.

396
00:38:55,567 --> 00:38:58,400
Oh, my God.

397
00:39:00,072 --> 00:39:01,907
I found it!

398
00:39:02,007 --> 00:39:04,273
Thank God!

399
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,721
What is so funny?

400
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,595
Looks like you have a little piece
of poo on your face.

401
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:27,719
- Yeah, 'cause I just fell down on it.
- You fell? You okay?

402
00:39:27,819 --> 00:39:30,502
I'm fine. Shouldn't we be
saving that or something?

403
00:39:30,602 --> 00:39:34,503
No, we've got plenty of water
at the lake. I brought the drops.

404
00:39:34,603 --> 00:39:36,671
Here.

405
00:39:39,443 --> 00:39:41,947
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

406
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:44,483
- This is it?
- Yeah, just up there.

407
00:39:44,583 --> 00:39:46,919
It's a real bitch to get up, isn't it?

408
00:39:47,019 --> 00:39:50,422
I know. But it's worth it.

409
00:39:50,522 --> 00:39:52,257
- Alright.
- Come on!

410
00:39:52,357 --> 00:39:55,384
- I'm comin'.
- Come on!

411
00:40:03,801 --> 00:40:05,904
Come on!

412
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:35,764
Alex...

413
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:47,012
Where's the lake?

414
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:49,280
I can't believe this.

415
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:52,534
- Alex... This can't be it, right?
- I don't... I don't understand.

416
00:40:52,634 --> 00:40:55,754
Fuck! I was sure. I was, like,
a fucking 100% sure. I was...

417
00:40:55,854 --> 00:40:57,991
- Can you look at me, please?
- Just let me think. Just let me think.

418
00:40:58,091 --> 00:40:59,830
Let me think. Let me think.

419
00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:05,194
Fuck! God damn it!
What the fuck is this?

420
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:11,103
Please tell me you have
a map in your bag.

421
00:41:11,203 --> 00:41:14,139
- I never needed a map.
- Oh, we do now.

422
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:16,774
I don't have one.

423
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:19,711
- So, then, where are we?
- I obviously don't know, right?

424
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:22,915
But you said that you've done this,
like, so many times...

425
00:41:23,015 --> 00:41:25,284
You said it was, like,
a few years ago you did this.

426
00:41:25,384 --> 00:41:27,286
Yeah, I've been to the park
a bunch of times!

427
00:41:27,386 --> 00:41:30,355
The trail, Alex.
You said you did the trail.

428
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:32,490
Yeah.

429
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:35,224
Not since high school, but...

430
00:41:45,636 --> 00:41:48,739
- It's not...
- I put it here. I...

431
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,677
I put it right here.

432
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,186
It's not...

433
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:02,421
- I took it out.
- What?

434
00:42:02,521 --> 00:42:06,491
Your phone. I took it out.

435
00:42:06,591 --> 00:42:08,860
Where is it?

436
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,496
- In the car.
- Why would you do that?

437
00:42:11,596 --> 00:42:15,934
I didn't want you on that thing
the whole time when we're here.

438
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:20,239
I didn't reach for that once. I wanted
to bring it in case we needed it.

439
00:42:20,339 --> 00:42:22,708
Which we do.

440
00:42:22,808 --> 00:42:26,909
- You can't get reception out here anyway...
- Well, I would have loved to try.

441
00:42:39,824 --> 00:42:43,228
When was the last time
you were sure of where you were?

442
00:42:43,328 --> 00:42:47,865
- I was sure the whole time.
- No. Think, Alex.

443
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:50,332
When was it?

444
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:53,738
I don't...

445
00:42:54,138 --> 00:42:58,134
- Maybe the fork in the trail
- The first one, the second one?

446
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:06,048
First one.

447
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:09,321
- Are you serious?
- Just... come on, don't freak out.

448
00:43:09,421 --> 00:43:11,223
I don't want to be
freaking out right now.

449
00:43:11,323 --> 00:43:14,393
But we are in the middle
of fucking nowhere.

450
00:43:14,493 --> 00:43:17,746
We don't have anything. We don't have
a map. We don't have a cell phone.

451
00:43:17,846 --> 00:43:21,199
We don't have anything.
We haven't seen anyone in so long!

452
00:43:21,299 --> 00:43:23,201
- This is... it's okay.
- Why...

453
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:26,338
Why did we have to come so far
on my first camping trip?

454
00:43:26,438 --> 00:43:28,273
Why couldn't it just have been
a regular trip?

455
00:43:28,573 --> 00:43:30,876
- Why do you always have to show off?
- I'm not showing off...

456
00:43:30,976 --> 00:43:33,437
- Why do you always try to impress me?
- I'm not trying to impress you.

457
00:43:33,537 --> 00:43:35,013
'Cause I'm not fucking impressed
right now!

458
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:37,082
Good!

459
00:43:37,182 --> 00:43:40,619
- I'm not trying to fucking impress you!
- Alex, could we be honest for a second?

460
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:43,985
I'd love to be honest for once.

461
00:43:44,655 --> 00:43:48,493
I wish I never came.
This whole thing was a mistake.

462
00:43:48,593 --> 00:43:51,630
- Come on, Jenn, don't...
- And we should be going home tomorrow.

463
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:53,698
But you fucked it up.

464
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:57,432
You always fuck it all up.
You're such a fucking loser.

465
00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:04,042
The stupid lake!
Why did we have to come here?

466
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:06,493
I don't even care why.

467
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:12,784
Why?

468
00:44:14,051 --> 00:44:16,685
I was gonna propose to you.

469
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:21,857
God!

470
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:22,350
I'm really sorry.

471
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:29,424
I had no idea.

472
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:41,305
It's okay.

473
00:45:42,307 --> 00:45:45,106
We should probably make camp.

474
00:45:45,606 --> 00:45:47,673
We're going tomorrow.

475
00:45:47,773 --> 00:45:49,681
- Okay.
- Okay.

476
00:45:49,781 --> 00:45:52,013
Sounds good.

477
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:43,654
- Was that a...
- No, no, no, no. It was a raccoon.

478
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:47,722
- You can tell me the truth.
- No, I saw the little shit last night.

479
00:48:53,998 --> 00:48:56,097
Shit.

480
00:49:04,841 --> 00:49:06,114
- Is this right?
- Yeah.

481
00:49:06,214 --> 00:49:09,152
We just need to take a
turn at that overgrown trail.

482
00:49:09,252 --> 00:49:13,515
- Didn't seem this far down.
- No, we're good. We're good.

483
00:49:14,084 --> 00:49:17,519
Watch your step. Watch your step there.

484
00:49:38,342 --> 00:49:42,062
- Sh... shit.
- Should we go back?

485
00:49:44,448 --> 00:49:46,519
I don't know.

486
00:49:46,619 --> 00:49:49,556
What are the chances this
leading to something?

487
00:49:51,556 --> 00:49:55,624
Pretty good. Right, it's provincial park.
It's gotta lead somewhere.

488
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:38,800
Here.

489
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:42,474
Thank you.

490
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:49,551
What is that?

491
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,194
Bear bed.

492
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:04,559
Okay.

493
00:51:05,663 --> 00:51:07,565
Okay.

494
00:51:07,665 --> 00:51:10,268
Let's go as far as we can before dark.

495
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:12,637
Right?

496
00:51:13,137 --> 00:51:15,173
Come on.

497
00:51:15,673 --> 00:51:17,839
Let's go, Alex.

498
00:51:41,398 --> 00:51:43,097
I'm so sorry.

499
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:51,571
Did you mean those things you said?

500
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:54,776
No, I didn't.

501
00:51:56,814 --> 00:51:58,499
'Cause, Jenn, I mean,
if that's what you feel abo...

502
00:51:58,599 --> 00:52:00,616
No.

503
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:07,091
I should have never said that.

504
00:52:07,191 --> 00:52:09,669
I was just really mad.

505
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:13,056
I'm sorry.

506
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,508
I love you.

507
00:52:21,405 --> 00:52:23,938
Do you wanna see it?

508
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:26,410
The ring?

509
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:28,387
Yeah.

510
00:52:29,846 --> 00:52:31,631
If you want to.

511
00:52:45,963 --> 00:52:49,749
No, no, no, no, don't.
No. Actually, just...

512
00:52:51,068 --> 00:52:53,079
wait.

513
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:59,140
Okay.

514
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:09,477
So hungry.

515
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:15,857
I think I... I think I have
half a protein bar left in here.

516
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:21,032
And this is all we have? This is it?

517
00:53:21,132 --> 00:53:23,198
Yeah.

518
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,203
Oh, wait a second.

519
00:53:25,303 --> 00:53:27,604
Except for...

520
00:53:34,177 --> 00:53:36,078
Ta-da.

521
00:53:36,178 --> 00:53:38,381
Come on.

522
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:41,152
- Really?
- Yeah.

523
00:53:41,252 --> 00:53:43,790
- You want some?
- Yeah.

524
00:53:46,923 --> 00:53:49,057
Straight top.

525
00:53:52,595 --> 00:53:54,365
You first.

526
00:53:54,465 --> 00:53:56,490
Okay.

527
00:53:58,069 --> 00:54:00,201
To us.

528
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:02,871
To us.

529
00:54:06,975 --> 00:54:11,779
That is so good. Have some. It's great.

530
00:54:15,452 --> 00:54:17,785
That is good.

531
00:54:23,327 --> 00:54:25,694
I know this sucks.

532
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,566
Could be worse.

533
00:54:28,666 --> 00:54:30,935
How is that?

534
00:54:31,235 --> 00:54:34,001
At least we're together.

535
00:54:39,176 --> 00:54:41,475
I mean it.

536
00:54:48,151 --> 00:54:50,318
Come here.

537
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:30,627
What is that, Alex?

538
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:32,891
I don't know.

539
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:44,039
Alex, do you think it's a bear?

540
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:48,106
Hey!

541
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:04,929
- Is it gone?
- Let's get back in the tent.

542
00:56:05,029 --> 00:56:06,562
Okay.

543
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:10,184
Okay. Let's go.

544
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:33,724
It's okay.

545
00:56:33,824 --> 00:56:36,884
We scared it off. We're good.

546
00:56:37,028 --> 00:56:39,894
Okay? We're good.

547
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:17,737
- Hi.
- Hi.

548
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:20,171
So, I was thinking...

549
00:57:20,271 --> 00:57:24,809
that I should phone down in the front desk
and order us some room service.

550
00:57:24,909 --> 00:57:26,875
Maybe a couples massage?

551
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:34,749
Deep tissues.

552
00:57:39,155 --> 00:57:41,824
We're gonna be okay.

553
00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:45,195
I know.

554
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:55,102
We should get going, okay?

555
00:58:10,254 --> 00:58:13,605
What? Alex.

556
00:58:14,325 --> 00:58:17,762
- What?
- Stay quiet.

557
00:58:17,862 --> 00:58:21,933
- You're scaring me. What?
- Stay quiet. Stay quiet.

558
00:58:22,433 --> 00:58:25,032
Did he come back?

559
00:58:29,806 --> 00:58:32,720
What the fuck is he doing?

560
00:58:33,477 --> 00:58:36,064
What the fuck is he doing?

561
00:58:42,085 --> 00:58:45,717
- Did it come back? Is it outside?
- Yeah.

562
00:58:52,095 --> 00:58:54,458
Please move on. Please move on.
Please move on.

563
00:58:54,558 --> 00:58:57,368
Please move on. Please move on.
Please move on.

564
00:58:57,468 --> 00:58:59,437
Please move on. Please move on.
Please move on.

565
00:58:59,537 --> 00:59:01,821
Please move on.

566
00:59:12,716 --> 00:59:14,085
- Oh, fuck!
- What?

567
00:59:14,185 --> 00:59:17,722
- Fuck! Fuck!
- Is it out there? Did it come back?

568
00:59:17,822 --> 00:59:19,157
What do we do?
We don't even have food in here.

569
00:59:19,257 --> 00:59:21,488
I know. Where's my axe?

570
00:59:25,885 --> 00:59:28,566
- What the fuck! Where's my axe?
- You put in your bag?

571
00:59:29,166 --> 00:59:32,133
I left my bag by the fire.

572
00:59:33,370 --> 00:59:37,074
I cannot believe this is happening.
What do we do?

573
00:59:37,174 --> 00:59:40,512
What do we do?
We don't even have food in here.

574
00:59:42,112 --> 00:59:44,078
Alex.

575
01:00:08,237 --> 01:00:10,303
Alex!

576
01:00:46,876 --> 01:00:49,148
Get behind me! Get behind me!

577
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:53,351
Get the fuck out!

578
01:00:55,491 --> 01:00:59,286
Get the fuck out! Just get out!

579
01:01:06,796 --> 01:01:08,863
Spray it!

580
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:24,346
I'm gonna wrap it. I know, just...

581
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:30,488
Okay. Okay, okay.

582
01:01:30,588 --> 01:01:32,341
It's okay. It's okay.

583
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:35,523
I'm gonna wrap it.

584
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:43,936
- It's okay.
- Jenn. Jenn, I can't feel my foot.

585
01:01:47,971 --> 01:01:50,341
It's okay. It's okay.

586
01:01:50,471 --> 01:01:52,238
- I can't feel my foot.
- I'm gonna get you out of here.

587
01:01:52,338 --> 01:01:54,745
We're gonna crawl out of here
if we have to. You hear me?

588
01:01:54,845 --> 01:01:57,652
- My God! I'm gonna fucking die out here!
- No, you're not!

589
01:01:57,752 --> 01:02:01,218
- I'm gonna fucking die!
- Alex! You're fine!

590
01:02:01,318 --> 01:02:04,542
Alex, you're gonna be fine.

591
01:02:18,501 --> 01:02:21,702
- No!
- Alex!

592
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:47,930
Run, Jenn! Run!

593
01:05:35,615 --> 01:05:37,239
Help!

594
01:05:38,868 --> 01:05:41,490
Help!

595
01:05:42,471 --> 01:05:45,947
Help! Anybody!

596
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:20,738
Help! Help!

597
01:14:33,068 --> 01:14:35,135
Fuck!

598
01:15:21,917 --> 01:15:23,950
Fuck!
