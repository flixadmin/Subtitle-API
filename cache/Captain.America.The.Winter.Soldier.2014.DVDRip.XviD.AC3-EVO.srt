1
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:04,788
Don't move.

2
00:07:24,576 --> 00:07:25,508
I told Batroc...

3
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:27,238
If we want to make S.H.I.E.L.D. pay us...

4
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:29,606
...start sending them bodies now!

5
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,484
I have a bullet for someone...

6
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:38,155
Move that foot. You want
a bullet in the head...?

7
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:49,567
I don't like waiting.

8
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:51,695
Call Durand.

9
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:55,062
I want this ship ready to move
when the ransom comes.

10
00:08:02,881 --> 00:08:03,779
Start the engines.

11
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:28,471
Shut up.

12
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,938
You want to be a hero? Is that it?

13
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:40,679
All right, I've waited long enough...

14
00:08:45,557 --> 00:08:46,489
Find Batroc...

15
00:08:46,658 --> 00:08:47,634
If I don't hear anything in two minutes...

16
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:48,785
...I start killing them!

17
00:08:49,094 --> 00:08:50,061
I'll find him.

18
00:08:59,171 --> 00:08:59,967
Two minutes.

19
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,697
Radio silence
from S.H.I.E.L.D., Batroc...

20
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:14,811
Time is up.

21
00:10:16,348 --> 00:10:17,747
Who dies first...?

22
00:10:19,451 --> 00:10:20,383
You!

23
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,451
Get that one.

24
00:10:42,407 --> 00:10:43,704
The line just went dead.

25
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:45,575
I've lost contact with them...

26
00:11:50,442 --> 00:11:52,202
I thought you were
more than just a shield...

27
00:12:06,325 --> 00:12:07,656
Let's see.

28
01:19:18,219 --> 01:19:21,052
I have her. Find him.
