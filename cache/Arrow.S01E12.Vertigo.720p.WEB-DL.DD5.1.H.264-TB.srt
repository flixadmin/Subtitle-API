1
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:12,478
Oh, my God!

2
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:16,732
Run, run!

3
00:00:26,927 --> 00:00:29,428
No, no, no, no, no!

4
00:00:50,334 --> 00:00:52,501
Oh, come on, man!
I'm just trying

5
00:00:52,503 --> 00:00:54,036
to make
an honest living!

6
00:00:54,038 --> 00:00:55,871
There's nothing honest
about what you do!

7
00:00:55,873 --> 00:00:57,923
Who supplies you with Vertigo?

8
00:00:57,925 --> 00:00:59,775
Tell me now and you live.

9
00:00:59,777 --> 00:01:01,927
Please!
They'll kill me!

10
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:04,663
Whoever you fear...

11
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:06,465
Fear me more!

12
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:08,267
Okay, okay!

13
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:11,970
We call him The Count,
that's all I know.

14
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:14,306
I swear to God!

15
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:18,644
Hey!

16
00:01:18,646 --> 00:01:20,679
Get me down
from here!

17
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:22,648
Find what you're looking for?

18
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,150
Took down three Vertigo
pushers tonight, Diggle.

19
00:01:25,152 --> 00:01:26,518
Last one finally knew a name.

20
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,153
The Count.

21
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:30,472
The Count?
That's worse than The Hood.

22
00:01:30,474 --> 00:01:32,324
You're not going
back out there.

23
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:34,293
I'm not done
for the night.

24
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:36,578
Whoever this Count is,
he has a lot of blood on his hands,

25
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,247
and it is long past time
he started paying.

26
00:01:39,249 --> 00:01:40,799
Well, slow down, I think
you're missing the point here.

27
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:42,534
What?

28
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:45,003
Thea.

29
00:01:45,005 --> 00:01:46,805
Her hearing's
in a few hours.

30
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:48,740
You think she cares more
about some drug lord

31
00:01:48,742 --> 00:01:50,375
getting his
just desserts,

32
00:01:50,377 --> 00:01:52,457
or you being by her side
when she needs you the most?

33
00:01:57,817 --> 00:02:00,068
Hey, we should
get going.

34
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:01,920
Judges don't
appreciate the value

35
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:03,438
in being
fashionably late.

36
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:06,462
Got any other tips?

37
00:02:06,463 --> 00:02:08,496
Let the lawyer
do all the talking.

38
00:02:08,498 --> 00:02:10,081
They'll give you
a pad and paper

39
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:12,333
but do not play
tic tac toe.

40
00:02:12,335 --> 00:02:15,553
Judges don't
appreciate that, either.

41
00:02:18,258 --> 00:02:19,724
Come on, Speedy.

42
00:02:19,726 --> 00:02:21,225
I know, I know.

43
00:02:21,227 --> 00:02:24,929
Keep on trying
to get up and go,

44
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:26,464
but...

45
00:02:26,466 --> 00:02:28,399
just don't.

46
00:02:28,401 --> 00:02:31,302
I wish dad were here.

47
00:02:31,304 --> 00:02:34,972
I'm here.

48
00:02:34,974 --> 00:02:39,026
We should leave now, Thea.

49
00:02:39,028 --> 00:02:41,412
Ms. Queen.

50
00:02:41,414 --> 00:02:43,531
Thea, over here.
Can we get a comment?

51
00:02:43,533 --> 00:02:45,032
Just one comment!

52
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:48,002
Thea, are you
going into rehab?

53
00:02:48,004 --> 00:02:51,456
Miss Queen, are you being
dispelled from Balliol Prep?

54
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:54,175
Are you worried
about the outcome?

55
00:02:54,177 --> 00:02:57,128
Docket ending 1-10-5-6,
People vs. Thea Dearden Queen.

56
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,713
Possession
of a controlled substance,

57
00:02:58,715 --> 00:03:01,382
driving under the influence
of a controlled substance.

58
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:07,405
Counselors, I understand
you've reached a plea agreement.

59
00:03:07,407 --> 00:03:09,474
We have, Your Honor.

60
00:03:09,476 --> 00:03:11,058
Given that my client
is a juvenile,

61
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,060
the people have generously
agreed to probation.

62
00:03:13,062 --> 00:03:15,279
Juvenile?

63
00:03:15,281 --> 00:03:17,115
Says right here she's 18.

64
00:03:17,117 --> 00:03:18,733
She is 18 now,
Your Honor,

65
00:03:18,735 --> 00:03:20,184
but at the time of arrest,
she was still two days shy

66
00:03:20,186 --> 00:03:22,069
of her 18th birthday.

67
00:03:22,071 --> 00:03:23,321
Ms. Queen
has no priors.

68
00:03:23,323 --> 00:03:24,705
Well, just because
Ms. Queen's family

69
00:03:24,707 --> 00:03:26,824
sweeps her priors
under the rug,

70
00:03:26,826 --> 00:03:28,159
doesn't mean they don't exist.

71
00:03:28,161 --> 00:03:30,628
You get your client off,

72
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,830
and you help your boss
avoid dealing with the drug

73
00:03:32,832 --> 00:03:35,750
that's sweeping across
our city like the plague.

74
00:03:35,752 --> 00:03:37,585
Everyone wins, except us,

75
00:03:37,587 --> 00:03:39,053
the people of Starling City.

76
00:03:39,055 --> 00:03:40,321
Your Honor,
with all due respect--

77
00:03:40,323 --> 00:03:42,390
Ms. Queen,
like it or not,

78
00:03:42,392 --> 00:03:45,226
you are now the poster child
for this menace.

79
00:03:45,228 --> 00:03:47,628
Maybe if people see
that the Queen family

80
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,897
can't get away
with using Vertigo,

81
00:03:49,899 --> 00:03:52,767
they'll think twice
before using it themselves.

82
00:03:52,769 --> 00:03:54,335
The plea arrangement
is denied.

83
00:03:55,855 --> 00:03:58,523
This case will
proceed to trial.

84
00:04:04,062 --> 00:04:07,615
They can't do this.

85
00:04:07,617 --> 00:04:10,201
That man cannot send
my daughter to prison.

86
00:04:10,203 --> 00:04:12,036
What are our options?

87
00:04:12,038 --> 00:04:13,671
An interlocutory appeal.

88
00:04:13,673 --> 00:04:17,241
But trial judges have discretion
to reject plea agreements.

89
00:04:17,243 --> 00:04:19,677
I think you might want to
prepare yourself for the possibility

90
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:22,380
that this isn't going
to go our way.

91
00:04:22,382 --> 00:04:25,099
I'm sorry, Mrs. Queen.

92
00:04:25,101 --> 00:04:27,018
I'll get to work
on the appeal.

93
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:32,056
Well, so much for the best
criminal defense attorney in the city.

94
00:04:33,692 --> 00:04:37,195
Thea, we will handle this,
I promise.

95
00:04:37,197 --> 00:04:40,364
Like you promised Walter
you'd always stay faithful to him?

96
00:04:40,366 --> 00:04:42,450
I feel better already.
That's enough!

97
00:04:42,452 --> 00:04:44,952
Don't worry.
Sounds like you won't

98
00:04:44,954 --> 00:04:47,872
have to be putting up
with me much longer.

99
00:04:49,658 --> 00:04:53,277
What, does she not realize
how serious this is?

100
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:56,581
She took drugs.

101
00:04:56,583 --> 00:04:58,749
She drove. She could have
killed someone, or herself.

102
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:01,252
I know.
All that judge is looking for

103
00:05:01,254 --> 00:05:03,838
is someone to make
an example of.

104
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,507
What does it have to be her?

105
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:09,076
Maybe it doesn't.

106
00:05:09,078 --> 00:05:13,264
Listen, I have to go
do something.

107
00:05:13,266 --> 00:05:15,733
Are you going
to be okay?

108
00:05:16,768 --> 00:05:19,570
I'm not the one facing prison.

109
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:39,206
You working
for them now?

110
00:05:39,208 --> 00:05:41,425
Why are you
doing this to me?

111
00:05:41,427 --> 00:05:44,045
I thought
we were friends.

112
00:05:44,047 --> 00:05:47,831
Or...something.

113
00:05:49,051 --> 00:05:51,769
I mean, why'd you bother
keeping me safe

114
00:05:51,771 --> 00:05:53,888
if you were just going
to hand me over to them?

115
00:06:00,445 --> 00:06:02,980
Just get me out of here.

116
00:06:05,016 --> 00:06:07,785
I can't.

117
00:06:07,787 --> 00:06:10,288
Hey! Don't leave me here!

118
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,239
I came back for you!

119
00:06:12,241 --> 00:06:14,742
Do you hear me?

120
00:06:14,744 --> 00:06:17,495
I came back for you!

121
00:06:21,818 --> 00:06:25,818

Hi. Looking
for Detective Hall.

124
00:06:32,422 --> 00:06:34,088
I was told
he works in Vice.

125
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:36,424
Oliver?

126
00:06:36,426 --> 00:06:38,726
McKenna Hall.

127
00:06:38,728 --> 00:06:40,144
Hi.

128
00:06:40,146 --> 00:06:42,063
Here I was,
expecting a middle aged guy

129
00:06:42,065 --> 00:06:43,464
in a bad suit...

130
00:06:43,466 --> 00:06:45,600
And I got McKenna Hall.

131
00:06:45,602 --> 00:06:47,468
I live to surprise.

132
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,020
Well, I remember.

133
00:06:49,022 --> 00:06:50,521
What was that club
that you got us kicked out of?

134
00:06:50,523 --> 00:06:51,990
The Club Deville?
Okay, in my defense,

135
00:06:51,992 --> 00:06:53,858
there was no sign
that specifically said

136
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,577
you had to keep
your clothes on.

137
00:06:55,579 --> 00:06:57,612
So, a cop?

138
00:06:57,614 --> 00:07:00,147
I guess you're not hitting
the party circuit anymore.

139
00:07:00,149 --> 00:07:02,367
I still go to raves.

140
00:07:02,369 --> 00:07:04,335
I just go
undercover now.

141
00:07:04,337 --> 00:07:06,004
And I have to dress
slightly more appropriately

142
00:07:06,006 --> 00:07:09,090
to hide my badge and gun.
Right.

143
00:07:09,092 --> 00:07:11,276
So what do you need
with a vice cop, Oliver?

144
00:07:11,278 --> 00:07:13,761
Vertigo.

145
00:07:13,763 --> 00:07:17,799
Right. I saw your sister on TV.
I'm sorry.

146
00:07:17,801 --> 00:07:19,133
The judge is trying
to make an example of her.

147
00:07:19,135 --> 00:07:20,518
So I was thinking,

148
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,053
if you could find the person
selling the drugs,

149
00:07:22,055 --> 00:07:24,305
it make take some
of the heat off Thea.

150
00:07:24,307 --> 00:07:26,641
Easier said than done.

151
00:07:26,643 --> 00:07:29,677
Did some digging
and came up with a name.

152
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:31,896
Um, The Count?

153
00:07:33,616 --> 00:07:36,317
Oliver, we've known
about The Count for months.

154
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,452
Oh.

155
00:07:37,454 --> 00:07:39,237
I wish this
was thicker,

156
00:07:39,239 --> 00:07:40,989
but we really don't
have much on him.

157
00:07:40,991 --> 00:07:43,074
Love to say we're
going to catch him

158
00:07:43,076 --> 00:07:45,660
before your sister's
trial, but it's highly unlikely.

159
00:07:45,662 --> 00:07:48,129
Oh, I am late
for my shift.

160
00:07:48,131 --> 00:07:50,465
Well, if you hear
of anything about this guy,

161
00:07:50,467 --> 00:07:53,468
just...let me know?

162
00:07:55,087 --> 00:07:57,805
I always loved how much you cared
about your sister.

163
00:07:57,807 --> 00:08:01,426
But leave the policing
to the police, okay?

164
00:08:01,428 --> 00:08:03,261
Okay.

165
00:08:12,187 --> 00:08:14,822
What did Queen want?

166
00:08:14,824 --> 00:08:17,358
He's an old friend,
sister's jammed up.

167
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,861
Anything else,
Sergeant?

168
00:08:19,863 --> 00:08:21,562
No.

169
00:08:39,915 --> 00:08:41,466
You need a tailor.

170
00:08:41,468 --> 00:08:42,800
You know about
the hood guy.

171
00:08:42,802 --> 00:08:44,085
He just
cornered me, man.

172
00:08:44,087 --> 00:08:45,436
The hood guy?

173
00:08:45,438 --> 00:08:47,755
I didn't
say anything.

174
00:08:47,757 --> 00:08:49,891
Oh, I know.

175
00:08:49,893 --> 00:08:52,493
You can't divulge secrets
you don't know.

176
00:08:55,231 --> 00:08:56,481
But...

177
00:08:56,483 --> 00:08:58,900
examples must be made.

178
00:09:02,204 --> 00:09:04,372
Vertigo,

179
00:09:04,374 --> 00:09:07,792
in its purest form.

180
00:09:07,794 --> 00:09:09,827
When injected directly
into the bloodstream,

181
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:12,246
it affects the thalamus
region of your brain.

182
00:09:12,248 --> 00:09:14,132
Which is where all
of the information

183
00:09:14,134 --> 00:09:16,300
from your pain receptors
is collected.

184
00:09:16,302 --> 00:09:19,286
No doubt you're in
excruciating pain.

185
00:09:19,288 --> 00:09:21,455
But actually, you're not.

186
00:09:21,457 --> 00:09:23,958
You just think you are.

187
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,643
I've seen it last for days,

188
00:09:25,645 --> 00:09:28,679
until finally
the heart gives out.

189
00:09:34,636 --> 00:09:37,021
One bullet left.

190
00:09:39,658 --> 00:09:43,444
Now, you can use
that bullet to shoot me

191
00:09:43,446 --> 00:09:45,163
and take your revenge,

192
00:09:45,165 --> 00:09:48,282
or...you could
shoot yourself.

193
00:09:49,301 --> 00:09:51,318
It's your choice.

194
00:10:09,489 --> 00:10:12,306
The Hood.

195
00:10:12,308 --> 00:10:14,909
Coming for me.

196
00:10:16,511 --> 00:10:20,314
Interesting.

197
00:10:47,794 --> 00:10:50,341
I'm learning you're not much
of a morning snuggler.

198
00:10:50,343 --> 00:10:51,988
And I'm learning that
you don't like to wake up

199
00:10:51,989 --> 00:10:53,672
at any hour
that ends in a.m.

200
00:10:53,674 --> 00:10:54,974
That's true. Yeah.

201
00:10:54,976 --> 00:10:56,775
So if you're busy
being a lawyer all day

202
00:10:56,777 --> 00:10:59,195
and I'm managing
a night club all night,

203
00:10:59,197 --> 00:11:01,330
when exactly do we get
to see each other?

204
00:11:01,332 --> 00:11:03,065
Hmm.

205
00:11:03,067 --> 00:11:05,501
I got it. Stay.

206
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,240
Hey.

207
00:11:11,242 --> 00:11:12,625
Hey.

208
00:11:12,627 --> 00:11:16,378
Hey, how--
how is Thea holding up?

209
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,747
She's doing okay.
Thank you.

210
00:11:18,749 --> 00:11:20,382
Um...Actually, I--

211
00:11:20,384 --> 00:11:23,385
I came to talk
to Laurel.

212
00:11:23,387 --> 00:11:24,720
Yeah.

213
00:11:24,722 --> 00:11:27,273
Hi.
Hi.

214
00:11:27,275 --> 00:11:29,808
Thank you for coming
to court yesterday.

215
00:11:29,810 --> 00:11:31,110
Yeah, of course.

216
00:11:31,112 --> 00:11:32,594
But I don't think
the judge is willing

217
00:11:32,596 --> 00:11:34,813
to move off his position.
Taking a hard line

218
00:11:34,815 --> 00:11:37,950
against criminals is
a platform for his reelection.

219
00:11:37,952 --> 00:11:40,152
I need you to talk
to your father.

220
00:11:40,154 --> 00:11:43,322
He's inside the system,
and...maybe he cashes in

221
00:11:43,324 --> 00:11:45,991
a chip with Judge Brackett,
gets him off throwing the book at Thea.

222
00:11:45,993 --> 00:11:48,377
Oliver, I don't--

223
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:50,946
Laurel, I am working
on something on my end,

224
00:11:50,948 --> 00:11:53,165
but...

225
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:54,967
If it doesn't work out,

226
00:11:54,969 --> 00:11:58,453
this is my best chance
to help my sister.

227
00:11:58,455 --> 00:12:01,123
Please.

228
00:12:02,475 --> 00:12:04,126
I'll see
what I can do.

229
00:12:04,128 --> 00:12:06,628
But no promises.

230
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,881
Thank you.

231
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,634
Yeah.

232
00:12:19,243 --> 00:12:22,194
Absolutely not.

233
00:12:22,196 --> 00:12:23,946
Dad, I know
how you feel about Oliver.

234
00:12:23,948 --> 00:12:26,115
Then why would you even
ask me to do this.

235
00:12:26,117 --> 00:12:28,033
Because Thea,
she's only 18 years old.

236
00:12:28,035 --> 00:12:30,669
Which makes her an adult.
She can take her medicine.

237
00:12:30,671 --> 00:12:32,955
It's about time someone
in the Queen family did.

238
00:12:32,957 --> 00:12:34,456
What about
the Lance family?

239
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,592
A young girl
acting out,

240
00:12:36,594 --> 00:12:38,210
engaging
in reckless behavior,

241
00:12:38,212 --> 00:12:40,429
does that sound
familiar?

242
00:12:40,431 --> 00:12:42,298
Laurel,
don't go there.

243
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,017
Thea, she's just like
I remember Sarah.

244
00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:47,186
That is not how
I remember your sister.

245
00:12:47,188 --> 00:12:48,854
That's because
you remember her

246
00:12:48,856 --> 00:12:50,222
the way that you
wish she had been,

247
00:12:50,224 --> 00:12:52,474
not the way that
she actually was.

248
00:12:52,476 --> 00:12:55,277
She's not the Saint that
you make her out to be.

249
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,063
I know she was arrested
for shoplifting

250
00:12:58,065 --> 00:13:00,065
and I know
you made it go away.

251
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:02,201
Well, maybe
if I let her go to jail,

252
00:13:02,203 --> 00:13:04,903
Queen wouldn't have had her
on that damn boat.

253
00:13:04,905 --> 00:13:07,740
Dad, you make it sound
like he kidnapped her.

254
00:13:07,742 --> 00:13:09,524
For so long,

255
00:13:09,526 --> 00:13:12,661
you and I have blamed Oliver
for Sarah's death,

256
00:13:12,663 --> 00:13:14,663
but Sarah's
to blame, too.

257
00:13:14,665 --> 00:13:16,982
When I look at Thea,

258
00:13:16,984 --> 00:13:19,335
I see Sarah's
potential in her.

259
00:13:19,337 --> 00:13:20,919
And her flaws, too.

260
00:13:20,921 --> 00:13:24,340
Yes, Thea made
a mistake.

261
00:13:24,342 --> 00:13:26,725
But she's been
through a lot.

262
00:13:26,727 --> 00:13:30,145
She lost a father
and a brother.

263
00:13:30,147 --> 00:13:32,348
She doesn't need prison.

264
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,150
She needs help.

265
00:13:35,152 --> 00:13:37,319
So please...

266
00:13:43,026 --> 00:13:46,495
I'll make some calls.

267
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:57,089
I've seen a fair amount
of Cyrillic back in Afghanistan

268
00:13:57,091 --> 00:13:58,841
left over
by the Soviets.

269
00:13:58,843 --> 00:14:00,843
Is this Russian owned?

270
00:14:00,845 --> 00:14:02,344
This is the not
so hidden headquarters

271
00:14:02,346 --> 00:14:04,346
for the Starling City
chapter of the Bratva.

272
00:14:04,348 --> 00:14:06,915
Diggle...

273
00:14:06,917 --> 00:14:08,801
Whatever I say,

274
00:14:08,803 --> 00:14:11,420
whatever goes down,

275
00:14:11,422 --> 00:14:14,139
just go with it.

276
00:14:14,141 --> 00:14:16,141
Zdravstvuyte.

277
00:14:16,143 --> 00:14:18,310
Good to see you.

278
00:14:18,312 --> 00:14:20,195
Long time.

279
00:14:20,197 --> 00:14:22,981
Particularly
for Bratva captain.

280
00:14:22,983 --> 00:14:25,100
I was trying to figure out
where to put my interests.

281
00:14:25,102 --> 00:14:28,153
I decided on pharmaceuticals.

282
00:14:28,155 --> 00:14:31,040
I don't mean aspirin.

283
00:14:31,042 --> 00:14:33,108
A wise choice.

284
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:36,662
Mepheodrone would be a good
investment for you.

285
00:14:36,664 --> 00:14:39,281
It's the newest thing.

286
00:14:39,283 --> 00:14:41,550
I was thinking Vertigo.

287
00:14:41,552 --> 00:14:43,285
Newer thing.

288
00:14:43,287 --> 00:14:45,170
Tough market, Vertigo.

289
00:14:45,172 --> 00:14:47,389
Only one seller.
I know.

290
00:14:47,391 --> 00:14:49,224
I was hoping you could
do me a favor

291
00:14:49,226 --> 00:14:51,744
and arrange a meeting.

292
00:14:51,746 --> 00:14:53,595
He's difficult man.

293
00:14:53,597 --> 00:14:57,683
And he does not
like new friends.

294
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,688
This is everything
the police have on him.

295
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:05,474
Tell him it's a gift.

296
00:15:09,662 --> 00:15:12,831
I will see
what I can do.

297
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:16,085
Provided you do
favor for me.

298
00:15:16,087 --> 00:15:17,986
Vse chto ugodno.

299
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,208
It is unusual
for an American

300
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:25,544
to hold such
a position of esteem

301
00:15:25,546 --> 00:15:28,931
in our organization.

302
00:15:28,933 --> 00:15:31,717
Mr. Queen.

303
00:15:31,719 --> 00:15:33,969
Anatoli Knyazev.

304
00:15:33,971 --> 00:15:35,938
He speaks
very highly of you.

305
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,108
He should.
I saved his life.

306
00:15:42,729 --> 00:15:43,946
What did he do?

307
00:15:43,948 --> 00:15:45,948
Something
I told him not to.

308
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,150
Now the favor.

309
00:15:48,152 --> 00:15:50,552
Kill this man for me,

310
00:15:50,554 --> 00:15:53,205
and I will believe
your interest

311
00:15:53,207 --> 00:15:55,741
in our organization
is genuine.

312
00:15:55,743 --> 00:16:00,462
And then I will arrange a meeting
with The Count.

313
00:16:04,467 --> 00:16:08,287
Oliver...
Hey, shut up!

314
00:16:28,225 --> 00:16:30,725
What are friends for?

315
00:16:31,995 --> 00:16:35,113
I'm out of the gates
now. What's going on?

316
00:16:35,115 --> 00:16:38,834
Are we getting
out of here?

317
00:16:38,836 --> 00:16:40,502
Where are you taking me?

318
00:17:14,153 --> 00:17:18,123
While I admit that bout
was particularly one-sided,

319
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,775
would anybody else
like to give it a try?

320
00:17:23,463 --> 00:17:27,082
The point of these little
gladiatorial distractions

321
00:17:27,084 --> 00:17:30,669
is to strengthen
unit cohesion.

322
00:17:30,671 --> 00:17:32,971
To that end, I think

323
00:17:32,973 --> 00:17:35,007
our newest recruit
ought to be afforded

324
00:17:35,009 --> 00:17:38,793
the opportunity
to try his hand.

325
00:17:51,407 --> 00:17:53,525
I can't believe
you just killed that guy.

326
00:17:53,527 --> 00:17:57,029
You really have
a low opinion of me.

327
00:18:09,042 --> 00:18:10,439
Whoa! That's a neat trick.

328
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,908
You going to teach me
that one day?

329
00:18:13,463 --> 00:18:15,213
No.

330
00:18:15,215 --> 00:18:17,266
What are you doing?

331
00:18:17,268 --> 00:18:19,051
You need to arrange
a new identity for this guy.

332
00:18:19,053 --> 00:18:20,218
Get him out of the city.

333
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,104
Right, so your Ruskie pal

334
00:18:22,106 --> 00:18:24,139
draws out The Count,
vigilante takes him down.

335
00:18:24,141 --> 00:18:26,058
No, Diggle,
because then the Bratva

336
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,060
would know that I used them,
and that relationship is too valuable.

337
00:18:28,062 --> 00:18:30,028
I do the meet
with The Count as myself,

338
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:33,899
let him leave, then we follow him
to his hideout.

339
00:18:33,901 --> 00:18:35,400
Just that easy, huh?

340
00:18:35,402 --> 00:18:38,353
Well, I will still need
my trust bodyguard.

341
00:18:38,355 --> 00:18:41,323
Fantastic. Looking forward
to my new and exciting career

342
00:18:41,325 --> 00:18:44,859
as a drug dealer.

343
00:18:44,861 --> 00:18:47,496
He's a captain.

344
00:18:47,498 --> 00:18:50,198
And he has money.

345
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,634
Are you interested?

346
00:18:52,636 --> 00:18:54,469
Hmm.

347
00:18:54,471 --> 00:18:57,622
Let's say...yes.

348
00:19:02,765 --> 00:19:04,916
My father was able
to get Judge Brackett

349
00:19:04,918 --> 00:19:06,401
to back off
his hardline stance.

350
00:19:06,403 --> 00:19:08,753
Your father hates me.

351
00:19:08,755 --> 00:19:10,121
No.
No.

352
00:19:10,123 --> 00:19:12,457
My father hates him.

353
00:19:12,459 --> 00:19:16,511
Look, nobody asked you
to get involved.

354
00:19:16,513 --> 00:19:17,846
I did.

355
00:19:17,848 --> 00:19:19,848
The judge has agreed
to a sentence

356
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:22,551
of 500 hours
of community service

357
00:19:22,553 --> 00:19:24,752
and two years of probation.

358
00:19:24,754 --> 00:19:27,589
Provisional on the appointment
of someone to act in loco parentis.

359
00:19:27,591 --> 00:19:29,824
In loco what?

360
00:19:29,826 --> 00:19:31,309
It means that
the court will appoint

361
00:19:31,311 --> 00:19:34,863
an individual to assume
responsibility for you.

362
00:19:34,865 --> 00:19:38,116
Me.

363
00:19:38,118 --> 00:19:39,734
I say thanks,
but no thanks.

364
00:19:39,736 --> 00:19:41,536
Thea!

365
00:19:41,538 --> 00:19:42,871
You don't actually
have a choice.

366
00:19:42,873 --> 00:19:45,457
Oh, actually, I do.

367
00:19:45,459 --> 00:19:49,044
See, I'm 18 now and I can make
my own decisions.

368
00:19:49,046 --> 00:19:54,516
So I decide not to be
your ex-girlfriend's office monkey.

369
00:19:54,518 --> 00:19:58,253
Well, if you change
your mind, then.

370
00:20:04,427 --> 00:20:06,228
Thank you.

371
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:08,179
Yeah.

372
00:20:10,233 --> 00:20:12,350
Thea...

373
00:20:12,352 --> 00:20:16,021
You're in real trouble,
and rightly so.

374
00:20:16,023 --> 00:20:18,073
Doing drugs
and driving?

375
00:20:18,075 --> 00:20:20,859
It is beyond stupid. That is
a good deal that Laurel got you.

376
00:20:20,861 --> 00:20:21,943
Why aren't you
jumping at it?

377
00:20:21,945 --> 00:20:24,362
I already have a mother.

378
00:20:24,364 --> 00:20:25,914
So...

379
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:27,415
you're going
to go to jail

380
00:20:27,417 --> 00:20:29,701
and it will ruin
the rest of your life.

381
00:20:29,703 --> 00:20:31,319
No.

382
00:20:31,321 --> 00:20:33,755
I want to ruin mom's life.

383
00:20:33,757 --> 00:20:36,675
She's a liar and a cheat.

384
00:20:36,677 --> 00:20:38,960
I mean, deal with, Ollie.
You can pretend

385
00:20:38,962 --> 00:20:40,929
all you want to
that she's a saint,

386
00:20:40,931 --> 00:20:43,598
but I hate her.
And she betrayed dad.

387
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,635
So you're just--you're going
to go to jail to spite her?

388
00:20:48,138 --> 00:20:50,338
Thea...

389
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,726
Mom didn't cheat on dad.

390
00:20:54,728 --> 00:20:57,195
He cheated on her.

391
00:20:57,197 --> 00:21:00,749
Is that the best
you can come up with?

392
00:21:00,751 --> 00:21:05,737
Dad wasn't the man
he said he was.

393
00:21:05,739 --> 00:21:08,640
On "The Queen's Gambit"
right before he died,

394
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:12,177
he admitted to me
that he failed us.

395
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:13,428
You.

396
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:17,232
Me. And mom.

397
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:20,819
That he wasn't the man
he said he was

398
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:24,038
and that he just wished...

399
00:21:25,758 --> 00:21:28,777
he wished he had more time
to right his wrongs.

400
00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:30,979
I don't believe you.

401
00:21:30,981 --> 00:21:33,114
Yes, you do.

402
00:21:33,116 --> 00:21:36,985
Leave me alone.

403
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,641
How dare you.

404
00:21:43,643 --> 00:21:47,228
She was old enough
to know the truth.

405
00:21:55,571 --> 00:21:57,205
Oliver, the Russians called.

406
00:21:57,207 --> 00:21:59,574
The meet is set.

407
00:21:59,576 --> 00:22:03,211
It's tonight.

408
00:22:06,349 --> 00:22:10,385
You know why
they call him The Count?

409
00:22:10,387 --> 00:22:13,188
When he was
developing this drug,

410
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,089
he experimented
on the homeless.

411
00:22:15,091 --> 00:22:18,059
Prostitutes, runaways.

412
00:22:18,061 --> 00:22:19,728
The police
would find their bodies,

413
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:21,980
puncture marks
on their neck,

414
00:22:21,982 --> 00:22:23,565
like a vampire.

415
00:22:26,786 --> 00:22:31,706
You should not be in such a hurry
to meet this man.

416
00:22:43,502 --> 00:22:44,969
Thank you for this.

417
00:22:44,971 --> 00:22:47,172
But I'm not
overly concerned

418
00:22:47,174 --> 00:22:48,423
about the SCPD.

419
00:22:48,425 --> 00:22:50,975
Now, I understand
you gentlemen

420
00:22:50,977 --> 00:22:53,845
wish to participate in
the feel good business.

421
00:22:53,847 --> 00:22:57,098
Yes.
And why is that?

422
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,566
Well, I am opening
a nightclub,

423
00:22:58,568 --> 00:23:01,636
and I'd like my customers
to have a little...

424
00:23:01,638 --> 00:23:03,738
something extra.

425
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,241
Well, as it happens,

426
00:23:06,243 --> 00:23:09,244
I'm looking
to expand my brand.

427
00:23:12,531 --> 00:23:16,684
A good wine's value is measured
by its vintage.

428
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:19,454
The number of years
it took to ferment.

429
00:23:19,456 --> 00:23:23,875
Vertigo is measured
in lives.

430
00:23:26,328 --> 00:23:29,497
56 people died

431
00:23:29,499 --> 00:23:31,766
to perfect this high.

432
00:23:31,768 --> 00:23:34,969
Believe me when I say
that they did not

433
00:23:34,971 --> 00:23:39,006
die for nothing.

434
00:23:48,902 --> 00:23:51,703
The cops!

435
00:23:51,705 --> 00:23:52,787
We've been set up!
Let's get out!

436
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:55,457
Go! Go!

437
00:23:56,525 --> 00:23:59,327
SCPD! Put your weapons down!

438
00:24:03,749 --> 00:24:05,700
Down!

439
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:11,339
Oliver!

440
00:24:11,341 --> 00:24:13,925
Hey!

441
00:24:18,597 --> 00:24:20,098
No witnesses.

442
00:24:40,035 --> 00:24:41,703
Get out of the car!

443
00:24:43,255 --> 00:24:45,907
Keep it.
Yeah, we got to go.

444
00:24:45,909 --> 00:24:48,026
Steps. Let's go.

445
00:25:10,827 --> 00:25:13,262
Oliver!

446
00:25:16,633 --> 00:25:19,301
Drink.

447
00:25:41,908 --> 00:25:44,159
Wait!

448
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:02,761
Mornin'.

449
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,657
How you feeling?

450
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:17,443
I feel like
I'm getting

451
00:26:17,445 --> 00:26:20,779
the worst hangover
of my life.

452
00:26:20,781 --> 00:26:23,231
That coming from a guy who spent
most of his twenties in a hangover,

453
00:26:23,233 --> 00:26:25,534
that's really saying something.

454
00:26:25,536 --> 00:26:29,621
You think
you can uncuff me?

455
00:26:29,623 --> 00:26:31,673
Not going to kill you.

456
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:34,076
Promise.

457
00:26:39,049 --> 00:26:41,216
Ahh.

458
00:26:45,055 --> 00:26:47,556
You're standing.

459
00:26:47,558 --> 00:26:49,424
That's pretty impressive.

460
00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:54,029
The Count only got you
with half a dose,

461
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:56,765
but you still sweated out
a small swimming pool coming down.

462
00:26:56,767 --> 00:26:59,952
The Count.

463
00:26:59,954 --> 00:27:03,122
Any chance our friends
in SCPD took him down?

464
00:27:03,124 --> 00:27:06,441
None at all, but we did
manage to get this.

465
00:27:06,443 --> 00:27:09,161
Think we should analyze it.

466
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:13,281
Listen, Oliver, maybe you need
to give it a few hours.

467
00:27:13,283 --> 00:27:15,683
A near drug overdose isn't something
you just walk away from.

468
00:27:18,922 --> 00:27:22,124
Neither is Thea.

469
00:27:27,931 --> 00:27:29,398
What's wrong?

470
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,817
Is everything
okay with Thea?

471
00:27:31,819 --> 00:27:33,735
This isn't about your sister,
this is about you.

472
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:36,989
Last night we got a call
from a C.I.,

473
00:27:36,991 --> 00:27:40,192
busted up a drug sale between
a big time dealer and the Russian mob.

474
00:27:40,194 --> 00:27:43,195
"We"? I thought
you worked Vice.

475
00:27:43,197 --> 00:27:46,098
Joint task force. Vertigo's
got everybody holding hands.

476
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,066
Like I said...

477
00:27:48,068 --> 00:27:52,621
Last night,
drug deal gone south.

478
00:27:52,623 --> 00:27:55,190
An eyewitness
put you at the scene.

479
00:27:55,192 --> 00:27:57,926
Whoever he is,
he's mistaken.

480
00:27:57,928 --> 00:27:58,911
Yeah?

481
00:27:58,913 --> 00:28:01,130
I saw you, Oliver.

482
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:06,618
Is this true?

483
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:09,805
I was checking
into The Count.

484
00:28:09,807 --> 00:28:11,440
He's the guy who
sold drugs to Thea.

485
00:28:11,442 --> 00:28:13,775
And I figured if I could find out
what he looked like,

486
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:15,978
then I could give your sketch artist
something to go on.

487
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,614
So I paid a low-life
with a Russian accent

488
00:28:18,616 --> 00:28:20,566
an obscene amount
of money to arrange a meeting.

489
00:28:20,568 --> 00:28:21,900
And? Did you get eyes on him?

490
00:28:21,902 --> 00:28:23,385
No.

491
00:28:23,387 --> 00:28:27,189
All right, are you pressing charges
against my son?

492
00:28:28,909 --> 00:28:30,993
You get involved
in this again,

493
00:28:30,995 --> 00:28:32,628
you'll see the inside
of a cell,

494
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:34,413
and unlike last time,
you will not see the way out.

495
00:28:34,415 --> 00:28:35,797
Detective.

496
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:37,833
Thank you very much.

497
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:42,221
Thank you for what
you did for Thea.

498
00:28:42,223 --> 00:28:45,257
My daughter asked me
for a favor and I did it.

499
00:28:45,259 --> 00:28:47,876
And that's the end of it.

500
00:28:55,101 --> 00:28:56,551
Hope you don't think
I sold you out.

501
00:28:56,553 --> 00:28:59,888
No. Just doing your job.

502
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:05,444
What on earth
were you thinking?

503
00:29:05,446 --> 00:29:06,778
I was trying to help.

504
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,080
By running around
with the Russian mob

505
00:29:08,082 --> 00:29:09,865
and a murderous
drug dealer?

506
00:29:09,867 --> 00:29:11,500
Are you out
of your mind?!

507
00:29:11,502 --> 00:29:13,585
Mom, look,

508
00:29:13,587 --> 00:29:15,170
the real reason
that you're upset

509
00:29:15,172 --> 00:29:18,207
is because I told Thea
the truth about dad.

510
00:29:18,209 --> 00:29:20,125
She never needed
to know that.

511
00:29:20,127 --> 00:29:22,794
Yes, I did.

512
00:29:22,796 --> 00:29:26,215
I'm old enough
to know the truth, Mom.

513
00:29:28,635 --> 00:29:32,471
It wasn't about
your age.

514
00:29:34,224 --> 00:29:39,394
It was about preserving
your memory of your father.

515
00:29:39,396 --> 00:29:41,396
He loved you.

516
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:45,100
No matter his faults,
he loved you.

517
00:29:45,102 --> 00:29:48,570
I said that I wished

518
00:29:48,572 --> 00:29:50,906
you had died
instead of him,

519
00:29:50,908 --> 00:29:54,609
but...you still
didn't say anything.

520
00:29:54,611 --> 00:29:56,411
Why?

521
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,382
One day,

522
00:30:00,384 --> 00:30:03,885
I hope you're lucky enough
to have a daughter,

523
00:30:03,887 --> 00:30:07,205
and you'll know why.

524
00:30:09,025 --> 00:30:12,127
I'm so sorry for what I said.

525
00:30:12,129 --> 00:30:15,597
I know, I know.

526
00:30:26,309 --> 00:30:27,609
Now what?

527
00:30:27,611 --> 00:30:29,311
Like you said,
we analyze the Vertigo.

528
00:30:29,313 --> 00:30:31,330
It's in liquid form,
which means it contains water.

529
00:30:31,332 --> 00:30:32,982
So maybe we can
trace back to where

530
00:30:33,007 --> 00:30:35,301
in the city The Count is...

531
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:39,988
cooking up this garbage.

532
00:31:41,394 --> 00:31:43,112
Hey, we need
to get you to a hospital.

533
00:31:43,114 --> 00:31:45,164
No.

534
00:31:45,166 --> 00:31:46,866
Oliver, God knows
what was in that drug.

535
00:31:46,868 --> 00:31:48,451
It could be causing
permanent damage.

536
00:31:48,453 --> 00:31:49,869
Felicity.

537
00:31:49,871 --> 00:31:53,005
Hey, they said
you'd be up here.

538
00:31:53,007 --> 00:31:55,341
You look like something
the cat dragged in.

539
00:31:55,343 --> 00:31:57,460
Not that there are cats
in this building.

540
00:31:57,462 --> 00:32:01,297
Well, once a cat did get in,
but a guard tazed it.

541
00:32:01,299 --> 00:32:04,967
It smelled like fur and static
in here for like a week.

542
00:32:04,969 --> 00:32:06,752
Ahem.

543
00:32:06,754 --> 00:32:08,471
Would you mind stepping
away from the window for a moment?

544
00:32:08,473 --> 00:32:11,090
I have a little bit
of a hangover.

545
00:32:11,092 --> 00:32:13,142
Sounds like you need
a bloody Mary and a pretzel,

546
00:32:13,144 --> 00:32:15,261
not the I.T.
Department.

547
00:32:15,263 --> 00:32:16,863
Actually, my buddy Kevin

548
00:32:16,865 --> 00:32:18,397
is starting
an energy drink company.

549
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,334
He says it's fantastic
for curing hangovers,

550
00:32:21,336 --> 00:32:23,452
but I am very particular

551
00:32:23,454 --> 00:32:24,820
about what it is
I put in my body.

552
00:32:24,822 --> 00:32:26,939
I've noticed.

553
00:32:26,941 --> 00:32:28,908
I said, not noticed.

554
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:29,942
Right?

555
00:32:31,579 --> 00:32:33,713
I'm trying to find
a secret recipe.

556
00:32:33,715 --> 00:32:35,298
Could you please
do a spectroanalysis

557
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,083
of the sample
and find out exactly

558
00:32:37,085 --> 00:32:39,886
where in the city it's made?

559
00:32:39,888 --> 00:32:42,755
If it's an energy drink,

560
00:32:42,757 --> 00:32:44,607
why is it
in a syringe?

561
00:32:44,609 --> 00:32:48,010
I ran out of sports bottles.

562
00:32:52,849 --> 00:32:54,600
Okay.

563
00:32:57,604 --> 00:33:00,639
Your B.S. stories
are getting worse.

564
00:33:00,641 --> 00:33:03,826
I'm well aware.

565
00:33:03,828 --> 00:33:05,828
Looks like Felicity
came through.

566
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,914
The solvent used
in the Vertigo sample

567
00:33:07,916 --> 00:33:10,583
was run off water originated
within a ten block radius

568
00:33:10,585 --> 00:33:14,537
of where East Glades
meets the bay.

569
00:33:14,539 --> 00:33:16,622
Nothing there except
for an old juvenile detention center

570
00:33:16,624 --> 00:33:18,758
abandoned about three years ago.

571
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,626
Cutbacks.

572
00:33:23,013 --> 00:33:24,931
You can't go out there,
though, Oliver.

573
00:33:24,933 --> 00:33:27,466
You're still suffering
the after-affects of the Vertigo.

574
00:33:27,468 --> 00:33:28,684
Did you hear The Count?

575
00:33:28,686 --> 00:33:30,853
He's taking
this drug citywide.

576
00:33:30,855 --> 00:33:33,172
If we don't stop him now,
this becomes an epidemic.

577
00:33:33,174 --> 00:33:35,007
I can stop you from leaving.

578
00:33:37,477 --> 00:33:40,313
Try.

579
00:33:45,902 --> 00:33:48,854
Oliver, you hit this
and you can leave.

580
00:34:13,146 --> 00:34:16,265
I'm glad you came
to your senses.

581
00:34:16,267 --> 00:34:19,151
You should always
remember one thing, Dig.

582
00:34:19,153 --> 00:34:20,269
What's that?

583
00:34:20,271 --> 00:34:22,721
I don't need the bow.

584
00:35:16,827 --> 00:35:18,210
My C.I. swears
this is the place.

585
00:35:18,212 --> 00:35:20,413
Bring your men
up on the flank.

586
00:35:20,415 --> 00:35:22,248
Okay, this way.
Follow me.

587
00:35:23,467 --> 00:35:25,584
He's here!
He who?

588
00:35:25,586 --> 00:35:27,887
The Hood!

589
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:45,821
Looks like we're not
the only guests.

590
00:35:45,823 --> 00:35:49,108
You should have stuck
to your depraved elite.

591
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:52,745
I am merely providing people
with what they want.

592
00:35:52,747 --> 00:35:55,114
I am providing
a public service!

593
00:35:55,116 --> 00:35:57,616
So am I.

594
00:36:08,261 --> 00:36:11,430
Enjoy the fruits
of your labor.

595
00:36:13,717 --> 00:36:17,136
Freeze! Put down the needle!

596
00:36:17,138 --> 00:36:19,388
Or I will shoot you!

597
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:29,132
Put down the syringe.

598
00:36:29,133 --> 00:36:32,287
He deserves this!
Not according to the law.

599
00:36:32,387 --> 00:36:33,457
The people that think
you're a hero,

600
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:36,159
people like my daughter,
if they could see you now...

601
00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:37,460
You're no hero.

602
00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:40,713
You're what I always
said you were--

603
00:36:40,715 --> 00:36:43,383
a killer.

604
00:36:45,285 --> 00:36:47,554
Get him!

605
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:56,229
Get me an ambulance. Now!

606
00:37:01,685 --> 00:37:03,970
Juvenile delinquent
reporting for duty.

607
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:05,638
Since you lost
your driver's license,

608
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,674
I'll pick you up at 5:00.
6:00.

609
00:37:07,676 --> 00:37:09,359
We have a lot of work
for her to do.

610
00:37:09,361 --> 00:37:11,911
Well, then, let's say
7:00 just to be safe.

611
00:37:11,913 --> 00:37:13,663
Is it too late
to choose jail?

612
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:14,998
Yes.
Yes.

613
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,617
I need you to go
through these files

614
00:37:17,619 --> 00:37:20,336
and pull out all the documents
dated March 2007.

615
00:37:20,338 --> 00:37:22,572
Do you think
you could do that?

616
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:24,824
I think I can.

617
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,595
I know I messed up.

618
00:37:28,597 --> 00:37:32,348
I really appreciate
this, Laurel.

619
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,100
We are going to make
an upstanding citizen

620
00:37:34,102 --> 00:37:36,335
out of you yet, speedy.

621
00:37:38,439 --> 00:37:40,523
Thank you.
And this will be good for her,

622
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:42,442
having a role model,
somebody better than me.

623
00:37:42,444 --> 00:37:44,360
Oh, you're not so bad.

624
00:37:44,362 --> 00:37:47,179
And besides, it'll be nice
to have her around.

625
00:37:50,235 --> 00:37:52,785
I got to take this.
Excuse me.

626
00:37:52,787 --> 00:37:54,120
Hello?

627
00:37:54,122 --> 00:37:55,955
We got The Count.

628
00:37:55,957 --> 00:37:57,740
Bust up his lab,
got him on everything

629
00:37:57,742 --> 00:37:59,876
from drug trafficking
to homicide.

630
00:37:59,878 --> 00:38:02,028
He'll be gone
for a long while.

631
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,997
That's great, thanks.

632
00:38:03,999 --> 00:38:06,699
It was great
seeing you, Oliver.

633
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:09,335
You, too.

634
00:38:09,337 --> 00:38:11,304
See ya.

635
00:38:15,542 --> 00:38:17,477
He's still critical.

636
00:38:17,479 --> 00:38:18,811
I've never seen
anyone OD

637
00:38:18,813 --> 00:38:20,930
on this much Vertigo
and live.

638
00:38:20,932 --> 00:38:22,432
There's just
no way of knowing

639
00:38:22,434 --> 00:38:24,183
what kind of damage
has been done to his brain

640
00:38:24,185 --> 00:38:25,485
and nervous system.

641
00:38:25,487 --> 00:38:26,886
Or if its irreparable.

642
00:39:37,174 --> 00:39:40,426
Shengeun...

643
00:39:42,395 --> 00:39:44,129
Survive.

644
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:05,201
Hi.
Hi.

645
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:08,320
Thanks for meeting me.
I was...nervous

646
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:09,705
to come to your house.

647
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:11,373
Okay...

648
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:13,342
The thing is,

649
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:15,094
I've been debating
whether or not

650
00:40:15,096 --> 00:40:17,546
to share this
with you for weeks.

651
00:40:18,548 --> 00:40:20,132
Can I trust you?

652
00:40:20,134 --> 00:40:22,635
I'm not an idiot.

653
00:40:22,637 --> 00:40:25,938
You've dropped some fairly
ridiculous lies on me,

654
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:30,142
and...yet I still feel
like I can trust you.

655
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,897
Why is that?

656
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:36,482
I have one
of those faces.

657
00:40:38,618 --> 00:40:40,236
Sorry.

658
00:40:40,238 --> 00:40:42,805
Yes.

659
00:40:42,807 --> 00:40:46,141
You can trust me.

660
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:50,028
Then I have something
to show you.

661
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:14,353
Have you ever
seen this before?

662
00:41:14,355 --> 00:41:16,221
No.

663
00:41:18,224 --> 00:41:20,276
Where'd you get it?

664
00:41:20,278 --> 00:41:23,162
From your stepfather.

665
00:41:25,999 --> 00:41:28,534
From Walter.

666
00:41:28,536 --> 00:41:30,369
Um...

667
00:41:30,371 --> 00:41:33,339
Well, where did
he get it?

668
00:41:33,341 --> 00:41:38,711
He said he found it
in your house.

669
00:41:38,713 --> 00:41:41,680
That it belongs to your mother.

670
00:41:41,682 --> 00:41:46,135
Walter thought
she was hiding something.

671
00:41:46,137 --> 00:41:50,539
Something more, and...

672
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:54,026
He wanted me to look into it,
but then he vanished.

673
00:41:54,028 --> 00:41:58,564
I think this list might have cost
Walter his life.

674
00:41:58,589 --> 00:42:03,589
