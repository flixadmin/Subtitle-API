00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,640
[door opens]

2
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,440
[Fernandez] <i>You talk shit like that with</i>
<i>her again, I'll rip your ass wide open.</i>

3
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,760
-[coughs]
-[door opens]

4
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,480
Bhumi, I don't think
you should take him so seriously.

5
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,880
He's going to do something.

6
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,120
-He will surely take revenge.
-Relax.

7
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,880
What can he do in there?

8
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,600
Huh?

9
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,240
Look at me.

10
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,120
Look at me.

11
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,600
I'm the one who chose you.

12
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,040
You were at the barricade one day
and I was passing by.

13
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,560
I saw you.

14
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,360
There was something about you.

15
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,640
I knew you could do big things.

16
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,560
And I'm proud of what you've done.

17
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,320
But, Bhumi,
you have only just started here.

18
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,000
There's so much more you can do.
I have a feeling.

19
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,680
Sir, all this sounds nice,
but I know what he's capable of--

20
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,800
I'm not just saying this
for the sake of it.

21
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,800
He's going to talk a lot of bullshit
during these sessions.

22
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,040
So what are we going to do, hmm?
Run out of the room every time?

23
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,040
What did the lady constable say?
"Into one ear and out the other."

24
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,120
Be stronger than you're being.

25
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,240
Show him you're confident.

26
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,240
Why should he be the one to scare you?
You scare him.

27
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,680
Control him.

28
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,160
Look him in the fucking eye.

29
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,000
And then we'll see
how he tries his bullshit.

30
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,320
I'm going in now.

31
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:00,160
You come in a minute later
and start all over again,

32
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,640
this time with confidence.

33
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,880
Come.

34
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,880
No more talking shit, asshole.

35
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,360
Where is the base of this operation?

36
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,560
-Your tone is a bit weak--
-Hey! Answer my question!

37
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,040
[chuckles]

38
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,800
Since you're asking me so nicely,

39
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,160
I will tell you anything that you want.

40
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,960
So, listen.

41
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,560
Cocaine and heroin.

42
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,240
Cocaine comes from South America,
heroin comes from Central Asia.

43
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,920
Both come into India
through different routes.

44
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,920
The problem is business is not well set.

45
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,720
So to set this up properly
we made a big plan.

46
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,400
After researching for five years,
we found that, in India,

47
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,640
Mumbai is the perfect city
where this business can grow.

48
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,520
Here we don't have one,
but one dozen warehouses,

49
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,080
you know?

50
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,920
I will give you all the addresses
if you want.

51
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,480
You know why?
Because you asked me a question, darling.

52
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,960
You can give all the addresses
to Fernandez Sir.

53
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,320
Tell him to go check them out.

54
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,600
Once he checks them, I'll give you more.

55
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,720
And please tell Fernandez Sir...

56
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,440
Tell him that Sasya is his friend.

57
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,600
Tell him Sasya said this.

58
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,200
[no audible dialogue]

59
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,120
[aggressive music]

60
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,640
[indistinct chattering]

61
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,520
What is it?

62
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,000
Why are you staring at me?

63
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,120
No one has ever looked at you
the way I look at you.

64
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,440
Hey, this is a police station.

65
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,120
You're in custody.
Think before you open your mouth.

66
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,520
Your face, figure,
they're all very ordinary.

67
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,920
Nothing special. I have had girls
who are much hotter than you.

68
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,120
You are nothing in front of them.

69
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,560
But there is something inside you.

70
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,760
I just can't look away.

71
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,080
I bet it's the scorpion inside you.

72
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,200
-I can feel its heat calling me.
-Just shut your mouth.

73
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,240
-I can actually feel it.
-Keep your mouth shut.

74
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,280
I don't know about other men.
Don't they feel it?

75
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,600
Look...

76
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,440
don't think you can get personal with me.

77
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,080
Personal?

78
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,000
You were a cop pretending to be a whore.

79
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,920
But what happened between us was personal.

80
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,720
Remember?

81
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,640
I remember.

82
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,240
That was not personal at all.

83
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,080
I was doing my job.

84
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,960
I was there that day.

85
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,360
And so were you.

86
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,120
I know what happened.

87
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,800
[door opening]

88
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,560
What happened to your questions?
You're not asking any questions.

89
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,320
Fernandez Sir is also here.
Come on, ask your questions.

90
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,200
I have been waiting for hours.
I have a lot to tell you today.

91
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,240
[interview playing over speakers]

92
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,200
[Fernandez] <i>Let's continue.</i>

93
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,120
[Sasya] <i>Now I'm going to say one name.</i>

94
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,080
Nayak.

95
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,760
Known to his people as Nayakudu,
meaning leader.

96
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,560
The police thinks that he's just a myth.

97
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,160
A legend.

98
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,560
They wonder if he really exists or not.

99
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,440
Because the police
have never seen his face.

100
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,240
But I'm telling you...

101
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,200
Nayak is real.

102
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,360
All of us work for him.

103
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,080
He meets very few people personally.

104
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,600
Most of them have no idea

105
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,320
that they're actually working for Nayak.

106
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,240
He keeps all his plans in his head.

107
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,360
He never tells anyone for safety.

108
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,960
He only tells us what we need to know.

109
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,640
I am special to him, so he tells me a lot.

110
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,360
And you are special to me,
so I'm telling you a lot.

111
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,320
[Sasya] <i>Do you remember Karwar, darling?</i>
<i>Five years ago, that arms-smuggling case?</i>

112
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,000
<i>There were dead bodies, shootouts.</i>

113
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,640
<i>That whole thing was planned by Nayak.</i>

114
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,960
<i>All this because he wanted to set up</i>
<i>his narcotics business.</i>

115
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,880
<i>He has been fucking with you cops</i>
<i>for many years now.</i>

116
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,440
-[reporter] Who is Nayak?
-We have only heard the name.

117
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,000
<i>But we have no real proof that he exists.</i>

118
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,800
[Sasya] <i>All the police did was seize</i>
<i>some guns and grenades.</i>

119
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,200
<i>And you were happy.</i>

120
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:25,440
<i>You posed for photos, took selfies,</i>
<i>patted each other on the back.</i>

121
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,480
<i>And he slipped away</i>
<i>from right under your nose.</i>

122
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,440
But now, sir...

123
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,800
I am, uh...
I am not working for Nayak anymore.

124
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,240
I'm working for you, am I not?

125
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,760
If you plan this properly, sir...

126
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,360
maybe...

127
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,680
I don't know...

128
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,320
you might get Nayak this time.

129
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,080
Deep, check and see if the whole
conversation has been recorded.

130
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,680
Sir, is this the same Nayak?

131
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,760
Huh?

132
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,040
-Nothing, sir.
-I'll have to inform Mathur Sir.

133
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,480
Double-check the recording.

134
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,360
Leena, I want that transcript
in ten minutes. I'm coming back.

135
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,680
Bhumi, good job.

136
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,440
You also want to finish
what we started that night, right?

137
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,040
What nonsense is this?

138
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,840
Finish what?

139
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,880
Don't get so angry, darling.

140
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,680
-Keep quiet.
-Baby, your blood is boiling.

141
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,440
You're burning hot but still ice cold.

142
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,560
You haven't fucked in a long time?

143
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,600
Don't you dare say one more word.

144
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,520
You don't know yourself at all.

145
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,760
You don't even know
the scorpion inside you.

146
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,600
I... I will tell you all about it.

147
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,280
I have touched it.

148
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,520
For so long, I have been trying so hard
to romance you like a true lover.

149
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,240
But you refuse to listen to me.

150
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,600
In the beginning,
I was alone in this story.

151
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,800
Then you entered.

152
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,000
Now both of us are here.

153
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,880
One day, we are going to be together.

154
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,600
And that day I am going to give you...

155
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,120
something that you truly deserve...

156
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,240
something that you so desperately need.

157
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,120

-Bhumi.
-Yes, sir.

160
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,120
Headquarters has sent some orders for you.

161
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
They have asked me
to relieve you of your duty.

162
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,000
What does that mean?

163
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,120
It means you have to leave
this police station.

164
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,680
Why?

165
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,920
Orders have come from above. I don't know.

166
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,440
Sir, I have some paperwork pending here.

167

POLICE STATION

170
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,960
[Mhatre] Bhumi, I am telling you...

171
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:44,120
go and say sorry,
and rejoin the interrogation.

172
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,960
So you are also blaming me,
like it's all my mistake.

173
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,800
Don't you understand how the world works?

174
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,840
What did Sasya say
that made you forget about your duty?

175
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,280
He was saying dirty things to me.

176
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,320
I'm a woman, right?

177
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,480
-So he was trying to overpower me.
-Here we go again. Woman.

178
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,840
[slurps] Now she realizes she is a woman.

179
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,280
What the hell is wrong with you?

180
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,720
What is wrong with me?

181
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,000
I'm still the same.

182
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,520
It is the operation
that has ruined everything.

183
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,280
Become a call girl, wear dirty little
clothes, get close to those dirty men.

184
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,000
Everything was going so well before this.

185
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,880
Drawing lines in the police register,

186
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:38,160
keeping the accounts,
standing on duty in the baking-hot sun.

187
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,080
That was "going well" for you?

188
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,920
This is so much better now.

189
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,080
It's like you are in a film.

190
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,920
Going in disguise, setting up a criminal.

191
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,520
International criminal.

192
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,160
Just the thought of it,
it's so exciting! [chuckles]

193
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,600
You looked so amazing,
I couldn't recognize you!

194
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,840
But now the film is over, right?

195
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,960
Now what?

196
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,440
Go and say sorry to them,

197
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,080
and hide your ego deep inside you.

198
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,000
You saw how they threw you
out of the police station.

199
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,000
If you don't have a job,
what are you going to do?

200
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,440
[detector beeping]

201
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,480
Excuse me.
You don't have permission to go in there.

202
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,160
Bhumika Pardeshi, Senior Constable,
Reay Road Police Station.

203
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,200
-I'm going for the interrogation.
-Your name is not on the list.

204
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,040
I am working with Fernandez Sir.

205
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,760
He only took your name
off the list. Sorry.

206
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,800
-Then I would like to go and meet him.
-He's busy now.

207
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,480
-Okay, then I'll wait for him.
-He's going to be busy for a long time.

208
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,120
Okay, then I will wait for a long time.

209
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,480
[indistinct chattering]

210
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,240
[Fernandez speaking indistinctly]

211
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,320
-Wait! You can't just go in like that!
-I'll call you back.

212
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,320
-What do you think you're doing?
-I would like to get back on the case.

213
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,200
To do the interrogation.

214
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,840
I'll do it properly, sir.

215
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,880
No need now. Go home.

216
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,240
Sir, I'm very sorry, sir.

217
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,600
Please.

218
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,440
You know, all this happened so suddenly,
so I got a bit scared.

219
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,760
But I won't repeat that mistake.

220
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,360
Bhumi, I'm looking at you right now,
but my mind is working on something else.

221
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,360
Do you understand?

222
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,800
[Rupa] Are you stressed?

223
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,440
No.

224
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,120
You should be.

225
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,040
Hemant told me what you tried to do.

226
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,440
If you have a problem with me
then you should have talked to me.

227
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,680
Huh?

228
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,680
You think you can raid
my boyfriend's hotel and scare him?

229
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,880
Taking advantage of the uniform, huh?

230
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,520
That's why you're stressed,
that he'll complain about you.

231
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,960
I'm not stressed because of that.

232
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,480
Then what?

233
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,440
I don't know
if I still have my job or not.

234
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,320
What do you mean?

235
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,760
I have a feeling
that they're going to fire me.

236
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,960
What?

237
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,040
How can they just fire you?

238
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,160
Huh?

239
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,040
Bhumi, what has happened?
Did you do something?

240
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,440
-It's nothing.
-Then how can they just throw you out?

241
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,079
This is a government job.

242
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,920
No, I mean...

243
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,800
it's just a feeling I have.

244
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,000
They are not going to fire me.

245
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,480
You said that a minute ago.

246
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,400
It's nothing. You don't worry.

247
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,560
If they fire you from your job then
how will we pay the rent of this place?

248
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,320
Hey.

249
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,920
That will not happen, Okay?

250
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,920
You don't worry about it.

251
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,200
What will we do?

252
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,160
Hey, Rupa...

253
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,160
you asked me, so I told you
what was going on in my mind.

254
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,560
I just said it without thinking.

255
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,880
Then don't do that.

256
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,920
Please don't do it again.

257
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,160
I promise, I'll never ask you anything.

258
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,280
As it is, you still have to get a divorce
from bloody Lokhande.

259
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,960
Asshole.

260
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,600
The man of the house
only made us homeless.

261
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,800
Go to sleep, go to sleep, hmm? Lie down.

262
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,440
Sleep.

263
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,760
[cell phone ringtone chiming]

264
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,320
-Sir, Bhumi's calling.
-Just cut it.

265
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,240
[phone ringing]

266
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,400
Yeah, I know that.
Just tell her we are busy.

267
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,880
Just look at her, Fernandez.

268
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,600
Do we really think this girl has
what it takes to face Nayak?

269
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,440
Sir, that's all she's required to do.

270
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:51,840
We are there to support her.
We'll be her brains and hands.

271
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,480
Fernandez, you can't be with her
all the time, can you?

272
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,240
There are bound to be times when
this girl is going to be alone with them -

273
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,320
alone with Nayak!

274
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,480
That's the hope, sir.

275
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,920
And if this hope becomes a reality,
what will this girl do?

276
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,280
I'm sorry, sir,
but it's not just Bhumi's life in danger.

277
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,800
Every Indian life is at risk if their plan
turns out to be a success,

278
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,520
and Mumbai becomes the new drug capital.

279
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,560
How will their plan be successful?
You have Sasya's information with you.

280
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,480
Use it!

281
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,760
Sir, the information we want
is in Nayak's head.

282
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,920
He doesn't tell Sasya everything.

283
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,960
Sasya is telling us whatever he knows,
but that's not all; there's much more.

284
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,560
Sir, Sasya has 100% faith in this girl.

285
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,480
He believes that Nayak will like her.

286
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,640
She's his type, sir.

287
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,560
Why this covert operation with a spy?

288
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,160
Sir, to begin with, how else will we know
if this is the real Nayak or not?

289
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,880
-Sasya will tell us.
-[Mathur] No, sir.

290
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,360
We cannot just blindly trust Sasya.

291
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,240
And we have no information so far
as to what Nayak really looks like.

292
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:56,600
That's why, just like this girl
verified Sasya's identity for us,

293
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,960
exactly like that,
Nayak's identity has to be verified.

294
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,280
Secondly,

295
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,400
if we start by arresting Nayak,

296
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,800
then all his operations will shut down.

297
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,720
And along with those operations,

298
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,840
all of the activities
and all of the people involved with them

299
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,640
will suddenly disappear.

300
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,200
So what I suggest is, the first thing
we do is to try and locate Nayak,

301
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,600
and then we track all his activities
with high-caliber secret surveillance.

302
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,720
So, this girl's job is to try
and identify Nayak?

303
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,800
No, sir. I'm sorry.

304
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,520
[Mathur] No, no, it's Okay. Carry on.

305
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,280
Sir, if Bhumi somehow invades
Nayak's personal space--

306
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,560
That is if Nayak
begins to trust her - only then.

307
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,640
...then Bhumi will be in a position
to get the kind of information

308
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,280
that nobody else knows.

309
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,600
Personally, I think this plan
is a little too weak.

310
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,920
And we cannot afford to have
a repeat of Karwar here.

311
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,240
Exactly, sir.

312
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,880
The Karwar case had no covert operation,

313
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,600
no information breakthrough,
like this one.

314
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,400
And even in Sasya's case,
we weren't very hopeful, sir.

315
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,680
But because of Bhumi,
he's in our lock-up today.

316
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,160
To be honest,
in Sasya's case we were fortunate.

317
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,880
But we can't rely on good fortune
every time.

318
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,200
Sorry.

319
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,400
I will be coming tomorrow.

320
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,040
So don't say sorry today,
say it tomorrow, hmm?

321
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,680
You have been coming here for three days
now. It won't make any difference.

322
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,640
Orders have come from the top.

323
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,480
You won't be given permission
to go back in.

324
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,720
But I don't have any other work to do.

325
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,840
And I cannot stay at home.

326
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,120
They start worrying
why I'm not going to work.

327
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,600
So I have no other choice
but to come here and wait.

328
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,520
So, actually, I should say sorry. Sorry.

329
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,160
Well, what can I say?

330
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,960
But at least you spoke to me.

331
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,080
At least someone spoke to me.

332
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,520
Thank you.

333
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,920
I have been sitting here for six hours.

334
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,720
No one has even looked at me.

335
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,920
-How are you?
-Huh? I'm good.

What are you taking nowadays?

Your body and face is looking amazing.

345
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:45,240
You need to take something
to control yourself.

And look at you.

00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,960
You're not even divorced yet
and you're hitting on your sister-in-law.

348
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,640
-That, too, standing outside a court!
-You'll tell the police?

349
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,320
Good morning, sir.

350
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,080
Why don't you explain to her

351
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,840
that my complimenting her
on her looks is not a crime?

352
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:03,880
Look, Lokhande,
let us just finish this once and for all.

353
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,280
This divorce is between you and me, right?

354
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,120
So please don't create a problem
in front of the judge.

355
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,520
Otherwise, he will ask us more questions.

356
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,360
This case will drag on
and the lawyers will take more money.

357
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,280
It will not be good for both of us.
You understand?

358
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,560
Let's go.

359
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,600
Ajay Khanna, Binita Khanna.

360
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,400
Ritesh Kerkar, Mansi Kerkar.

361
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,280
Why didn't your client come
to the last hearing?

362
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,080
We waited here for so long.

363
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,720
My head was not clear then.

364
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,360
It's clear now.

365
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,280
And I don't want to pay
the alimony amount.

366
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,600
What is he saying?

367
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,560
Everything's decided.
It's all in the agreement.

368
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,200
-Now, what is his problem?
-She is the one with the problem.

369
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,120
They made a fool out of me.

370
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,240
-Listen--
-Hey, she is not worthy of being a wife.

371
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,600
-Why?
-Why?

372
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,040
Hey, sir, what do you say?

373
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,560
Shall I tell them?

374
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,400
Hey, don't touch me!

375
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,560
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

376
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,600
Listen, can you come out? I want to talk.

377
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,760
No. Say whatever you need to, right here.

378
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,200
[clerk] Karman Sheikh, Laila Sheikh.
Anil Dalve, Sunita Dalve.

379
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,760
Listen.

380
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,640
Come outside for two minutes.

381
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,760
I'll come wherever you ask me to.

382
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,120
I'm coming.

383
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,000
What is the point
of saying all this, Lokhande?

384
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,520
What do you want, huh?

385
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,360
And what the hell?

386
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,160
Why do you keep saying
she's not worthy of being your wife?

387
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,360
-How is she not worthy?
-She is not worthy like you.

388
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,080
Look, Lokhande, listen.

389
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,040
As far as alimony is concerned,
I'm willing to take less, Okay?

390
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,440
Not less, nothing.

391
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,880
Okay, fine. I'm ready to take half
of what he had decided.

392
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,160
I'll just open the agreement on my phone,

393
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,560
and let us finalize it
once and for all, Okay?

394
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,200
Do I get your sister in this deal?

395
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,360
-[cell phone chimes]
-I can't believe you said that.

396
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,200
-I have to go right now!
-What?

397
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,800
-I got a call from work.
-But you finally got him here.

398
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,560
The judge is going to call in ten minutes!

399
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,960
-They are calling me right now--
-So tell them you're busy!

400
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,480
-It's urgent. I have to go right away.
-It can't be so... Bhumi!

401
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,120
Hey, it must be a big case.

402
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,200
That's why they want
the top policeman in the city!

403
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,960
[traffic blaring]

404
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,000
[Bhumi panting]

405
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,440
-Fernandez Sir?
-Fifth floor.

406
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,600
[fast-paced music]

407
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,680
[panting]

408
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,080
[panting continues]

409
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,120
[footsteps approaching]

410
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,760
-Sir, this--
-Sit.

411
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,840
This is a psychometric test.
You need to take it.

412
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,760
Whatever the right answer is,
mark it with the pen.

413
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,680
And where it says "explain,"
give a detailed answer.

414
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,040
Sir... Sir, why am I doing this test?

415
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,680
I don't have any answers,
so don't ask me questions.

416
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,160
I am doing what I have been told to do.

417
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:14,640
You have only one hour
to complete this test.

418
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,720
Your time starts now.

419
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,000
<i>[male voice] "I respond well</i>
<i>to instruction by seniors."</i>

420
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,520

<i>onger hours without getting tired."</i>

421
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,600

422

<i>and wrong from other people."</i>

424

425
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,160

426

[voices stop]

433
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,240
I will send the results to Fernandez
by 12 tomorrow.

434
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,000
[Bhumi] <i>There was no time to think at all.</i>

435
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,440
I wrote whatever I thought was right
at that time.

436
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,120
I have no idea what it was.

437
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,200
Some psychometric thing.

438
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,200
I had never even heard of it before.

439
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,320
Come here.

440
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,200
Mhatre, one minute.

441
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,240
Yes, madam?

442
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,000
Were you staring at me right now?

443
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,240
Madam, I'm a waiter.
I have to keep an eye on things.

444
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,560
In case someone wants anything.

445
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,080
Forget about other people.

446
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,080
I'm asking about me.

447
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,760
Mhatre, I'll call you back.

448
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,800
Were you staring at me...

449
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,480
or not?

450
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,840
Have a look.

451
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,560
Excuse me.

452
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,720
Where is the toilet?

453
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,560
[waiter gasps]

454
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,920
[breathing shakily]

455
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,880
Is something happening?

456
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,080
Now?

457
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:54,440
Did you feel anything?

458
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,160
Touch me.

459
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,920
Touch.
