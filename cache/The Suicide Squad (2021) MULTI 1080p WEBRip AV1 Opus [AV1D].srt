I got another 15.

14
00:01:39,125 --> 00:01:41,250
Not today, you don't.
You're up.

15
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:46,500
You know the deal.

16
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:47,892
Successfully complete
the mission,

17
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:49,625
you get ten years
off your sentence.

18
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:54,416
<i>You fail to follow my orders
in any way</i>

19
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:58,625
<i>and I detonate the explosive
device in the base of your skull.</i>

20
00:01:58,708 --> 00:01:59,916
Good dog.

21
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,500
<i>We are a black ops unit.</i>

22
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:04,083
<i>Meaning, nothing you see here
ever happened.</i>

23
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,833
Savant.

24
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:07,809
<i>Your commanding officer
will be Colonel Rick Flag.</i>

25
00:02:07,833 --> 00:02:09,708
Or would you
rather be called Durlin?

26
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,500
I'd rather not be called at all.

27
00:02:11,583 --> 00:02:14,708
But I'll do anything
to get out of this hellhole.

28
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:19,958
Well,
welcome to "anything."

29
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:26,708
So this is
the famous Suicide Squad.

30
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:29,291
Well, we consider
that term degrading.

31
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:31,750
The official term
is "Task Force X."

32
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:33,375
And love 'em or hate 'em,

33
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,739
these are your brothers and
sisters for the next few days.

34
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,833
Oh!

35
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:42,791
Whoa.

36
00:02:56,625 --> 00:02:58,375
Captain Boomerang.

37
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,000
Blackguard.

38
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:02,875
Mongal.

39
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,166
Javelin.

40
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:10,666
Weasel.

41
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,250
And, of course...

42
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:16,916
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.
Had to go number two.

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,333
Hmm, good to know.

44
00:03:19,458 --> 00:03:20,375
Flag.

45
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,250
Oh, sorry. Comin' through.

46
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:23,541
Hey, Boomer.

47
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,250
What are you doing back
in prison, Harls?

48
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,333
I got road rage. In a bank.

49
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,458
Oh. So sorry. Comin' through.

50
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:32,041
- Turn it around. There. No.
- There? Here?

51
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,041
Put it in there.
Now you're safe.

52
00:03:34,125 --> 00:03:35,500
All right.

53
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,916
Thanks, man.

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,250
Prepare for liftoff.
And away we go.

55
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:48,958
- Harley and T.D.K...
- Digger.

56
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,441
Have they worked
together before?

57
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,583
Not yet. I'm excited.

58
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:52,684
What does Savant do again?

59
00:03:52,708 --> 00:03:54,125
It's Brian Durlin.

60
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,458
He's an expert in weapons
and hand-to-hand combat.

61
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,958
Yeah, well, I'm putting 20
on him that he's gonna bite it.

62
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,291
Me too. And Weasel,

63
00:04:00,375 --> 00:04:01,958
- Boomer and Mongal.
- Yeah, I think...

64
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:04,291
Is Mongal an alien
or some type of god?

65
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:05,666
- What are you doing?
- Oh. Hey.

66
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,101
Just making sure
everything was ready to go.

67
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,375
Good meeting, everybody.

68
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:10,083
Just our normal,
casual morning meeting.

69
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,559
Yeah, I just gotta, uh,
do this thing.

70
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:12,833
Nothing weird about it.

71
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:14,000
- Okay.
- Oh, yeah.

72
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,791
Flag.

73
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,101
<i>Yeah, we're T-minus five
from the drop.</i>

74
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,125
Get the whole team safely

75
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,666
<i>to that beach, Colonel.</i>

76
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,083
<i>You will receive
further orders once there.</i>

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,291
We're in
a butcher's freezer, Harls,

78
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:45,916
surrounded by dead hogs
hangin' on hooks.

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,500
Only they don't know it yet.

80
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:50,166
Leave him alone, Boomer.

81
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,333
What does T.D.K. stand for?

82
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:53,333
What?

83
00:04:53,416 --> 00:04:55,958
Your name is T.D.K., correct?

84
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,333
Yeah.

85
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:59,166
And it stands for what?

86
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:01,458
It stands for me.

87
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,875
It's what a name is.

88
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,833
Your name is letters?

89
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:07,041
All names are letters, dickhead.

90
00:05:11,875 --> 00:05:13,291
I love your accent.

91
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:15,291
American women all love accents.

92
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:18,208
We do.
'Cause we don't got none.

93
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,916
- Yo, is this a dog?
- What?

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,375
Is this thing a dog?

95
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,291
- A... A dog?
- Yes.

96
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,416
What kind of dog
do you think it is, mate?

97
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,541
I don't know, I'm not familiar
with all the breeds.

98
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,291
I'm gonna go with Afghan Hound.

99
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:35,625
Since when does an Afghan
Hound have bloody thumbs?

100
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,583
Oh, my God, is it a werewolf?

101
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,458
I've wanted to meet
a werewolf forever.

102
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,083
Yo, they sat me
next to a werewolf?

103
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:42,541
That's not right.

104
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,142
Yo, let me out.
I do not fuck with werewolves.

105
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,166
Hey, hey,
he's not a werewolf, okay!

106
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,666
He's a weasel. He's harmless.

107
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,083
I mean, he's not harmless,
he's killed 27 children,

108
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:51,708
but, you know, we got him to...

109
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,333
I think he's agreed to do this.

110
00:05:53,416 --> 00:05:54,625
Whatever the case,

111
00:05:54,708 --> 00:05:56,625
just everyone
get into position to drop.

112
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:58,916
Did anyone check
on whether Weasel could swim?

113
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,875
The Weasel is dead! I repeat,

114
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:43,125
<i>the Weasel is dead.</i>

115
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:45,875
Northeast, all clear.
Approach the shore.

116
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:46,833
<i>Over.</i>

117
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:48,708
Savant, hold your position.

118
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:50,583
Roger that.

119
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:56,958
Amateurs.

120
00:08:10,375 --> 00:08:12,125
Waller, we're
on the beach and dry.

121
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,976
- Blackguard. Get down, you...
- Hey, guys! Hey.

122
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,392
There's fucking soldiers
everywhere!

123
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:39,875
You can come out now,
it's just me.

124
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:41,916
What the fuck
is Blackguard doin'?

125
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,416
I'm the one who contacted you.

126
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,267
Is this what's supposed
to happen? What the fuck?

127
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,250
Blackguard, get back
into your position.

128
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:49,000
Look, look.
I brought everybody, look.

129
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:50,541
They're right behind me.

130
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:52,875
Whoa. Hey.

131
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,666
Hey, guys. Whoa.

132
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:57,458
We got a deal, right?
Uh... Uh...

133
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,083
Waller, we're made.

134
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:01,416
I'm the one who called you.

135
00:09:06,875 --> 00:09:08,625
Blackguard sold us out.

136
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:12,375
<i>He contacted the fucking
Corto Maltese Army!</i>

137
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,000
<i>Waller, we need to retreat.</i>

138
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:15,958
Negative, Flag.

139
00:09:16,041 --> 00:09:17,333
The mission is too important.

140
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,666
<i>This is a tough group.</i>

141
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,291
<i>- You can make it.</i>
- Okey-doke.

142
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:21,684
Waller, with all due respect,
we're in the middle

143
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:22,958
of a goddamn... Harley, wait!

144
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,333
Whoo-hoo!

145
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,916
Zero-two-two-seven is wide open.

146
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,333
Colonel, dispatch

147
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,875
<i>- The Detachable Kid.</i>
- T.D.K., two o'clock!

148
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,875
T.D.K. is "The Detachable Kid"?

149
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,375
What the fuck?

150
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,416
I didn't pick the damn team!

151
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,833
Don't worry, Flag,
I got the bird.

152
00:10:42,916 --> 00:10:45,583
Mongal! Don't.

153
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,500
Huh?

154
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,166
Strewth!

155
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,291
Boomer!

156
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,250
Savant is off the rails.

157
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,291
Savant, turn back.

158
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,541
<i>Savant.</i>

159
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,458
Savant, I'm warning you,
this is desertion.

160
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,291
Savant!

161
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:58,083
This is your last chance.
Turn back around.

162
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:00,333
<i>You are in violation
of your agreement!</i>

163
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,625
<i>Oh, please! No.</i>

164
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:10,041
Damn it.

165
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,083
How's Team Two holding up?

166
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,083
Team Two, check.
Set point bravo.

167
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,958
All troops on the south beach
are engaged.

168
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:38,291
Team Two is clear to go
on the north beach.

169
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,166
Congratulations, Bloodsport.

170
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,833
How'd you do it, Waller?

00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:28,875
Excuse me.

213
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,958
Who the fuck is Bloodsport?

214
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:36,166
Robert Dubois.

215
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,333
A world-class marksman.

216
00:15:38,416 --> 00:15:41,291
In his hands,
anything is a deadly weapon.

217
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,916
His father was a mercenary

218
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,916
who trained his son to kill
from the moment he was born.

219
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,708
He's in prison for putting
Superman in the ICU

220
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:50,916
with a kryptonite bullet.

221
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,166
- Dubois?
- Same answer as the last time.

222
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,250
Piss off.

223
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,333
I'm not joining your goddamn
Suicide Squad.

224
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,041
We'll see.

225
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,583
You have a visitor.

226
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:21,083
They said you got in trouble.

227
00:16:22,125 --> 00:16:23,458
<i>I stole.</i>

228
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:24,666
You stole what?

229
00:16:26,416 --> 00:16:29,000
<i>- A style watch.</i>
- A star latch?

230
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:32,541
A style watch.
You can watch TV on it.

231
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,708
<i>Why would you want to
watch TV on your watch?</i>

232
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:36,166
I don't know.

233
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,875
<i>Next time you want
to nick something,</i>

234
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,000
<i>you take a partner,</i>

235
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:40,291
<i>and they can be your lookout.</i>

236
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,416
<i>That's your advice?</i>

237
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,416
<i>Yeah.</i>

238
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,250
<i>You're a terrible father.</i>

239
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:46,892
<i>Hey, I didn't ask to be
a father in the first place.</i>

240
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,125
<i>You make that perfectly clear.</i>

241
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:50,250
Your mother sprung
that one on me.

242
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,583
<i>Well, she's not around anymore,</i>

243
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:52,851
<i>so you can lay off of her, okay?</i>

244
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,208
<i>Oh, I tried to lay off her,</i>

245
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:55,851
but then she dragged out
the paternity test.

246
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,416
<i>- Fuck you!
- No, fuck you!</i>

247
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,875
<i>- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!</i>

248
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,291
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

249
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,958
<i>- Fuck you!</i>
- Fuck you!

250
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,333
<i>Fuck you!</i>

251
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,666
I can't believe
you don't care that I stole,

252
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,250
only that I got caught!

253
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:08,726
I don't only care
that you got caught,

254
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,184
I care that you got caught
for stealing

255
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:13,125
something as stupid
as a fucking TV watch!

256
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,875
It does other things too!

257
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,718
<i>But nothing that your phone
can't fucking do!</i>

258
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:17,750
<i>It's embarrassing!</i>

259
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,250
<i>No, what's fucking embarrassing</i>

260
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,708
<i>is having you as my father.</i>

261
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:31,708
<i>Yeah, well, I told you, Tyla,</i>

262
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:33,375
<i>when I came here
that any goodness</i>

263
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:37,125
I ever had in me had been
wrung out bare by my old man.

264
00:17:37,208 --> 00:17:39,583
And I also told you to go out
there and do your own thing

265
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:40,958
and stay far away

266
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:44,333
<i>from me or anyone like me,
didn't I?</i>

267
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,458
So, why are you here
when you and I both know

268
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,708
I have nothing good
to offer you?

269
00:17:50,958 --> 00:17:53,916
<i>Because my court date
is coming up,</i>

270
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,291
<i>and Miss Waller said
maybe you could help me out.</i>

271
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,666
To get me to lead
your shite fucking mission,

272
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:01,916
you're gonna send my
14-year-old daughter to prison?

273
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
No.

274
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,666
Your daughter is 16, Dubois.

275
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,250
You're a real
father of the year.

276
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,892
Fine. You know what,
Tyla needs to grow up anyway

277
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,434
'cause she's a little ditzy
like her fucking mother.

278
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,833
So, a year in juvie,
no fucking problem.

279
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:16,958
Not juvie. Being 16
in the state of Louisiana

280
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:19,666
means that
under the right circumstances,

281
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,333
she could be tried as an adult.

282
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:22,666
And, if convicted,

283
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:26,708
could be sent right here
to old Belle Reve.

284
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:29,083
And in here, well, you never
know what might happen

285
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:31,291
to a frail young thing
like that.

286
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,708
Shames me to say

287
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,708
that we have
the highest mortality rate

288
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,250
in the entire
U.S. prison system.

289
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,500
Whoa, hey, hey, hey!

290
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:44,101
You're threatening
my fucking daughter!

291
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,833
I'm protecting this country.

292
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,958
- Everyone stand down.
- Miss Waller, I...

293
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,875
Stand down!

294
00:18:54,666 --> 00:18:56,541
I wouldn't take
such extreme measures...

295
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,416
Oh, extreme?
Oh, yeah, a little extreme.

296
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,375
If this mission
weren't more important

297
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,000
than you could possibly imagine.

298
00:19:02,083 --> 00:19:03,375
Fuck your mission.

299
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,101
You have the military
experience necessary,

300
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,666
and everything in your
psychological profile tells me

301
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,250
you have what it takes
to be a leader.

302
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,083
No, I'm no fucking leader!

303
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,083
Then I'll make you one.

304
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:19,583
Are you in or out?

305
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:26,500
Good. Let's meet your team.

306
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:29,958
- Come on.
- Fuck me, man.

307
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:32,750
Let's go.

308
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:34,166
She was gonna kill his kid?

309
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,458
Each member
of the team is chosen

310
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:43,166
for his or her own completely
unique set of abilities.

311
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:47,250
This is Christopher Smith,
known as Peacemaker.

312
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,916
In his hands,
anything is a deadly weapon.

313
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,041
His father was a soldier
who trained his son

314
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:54,083
how to kill from the moment
he was born.

315
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,000
- Are you having a laugh?
- What?

316
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:57,851
You just said each member
of the team is chosen

317
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,583
for their unique abilities.
He does exactly what I do.

318
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:01,833
But better.

319
00:20:01,916 --> 00:20:03,142
I always hit
my targets dead center.

320
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,500
I hit them more in the center.

321
00:20:04,583 --> 00:20:05,851
Well, you can't hit something
more in a center.

322
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,208
- I use smaller bullets.
- What?

323
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,559
They go inside your bullet holes

324
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:09,809
without even touching the side.

325
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,375
Next up is King Shark.

326
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:13,458
Holy shit.

327
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,708
What the fuck?

328
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:17,208
Some people claim

329
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:20,041
that Nanaue is a descendant
of an ancient shark god.

330
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:22,458
Whatever the case,
he's strong and deadly.

331
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:23,958
Does it talk?

332
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,125
- Book read.
- Wow.

333
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,541
Book's upside-down.

334
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:28,976
See that? It's pretending
to read a book.

335
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,583
So smart, me.
Enjoy book so much.

336
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:34,875
Be a mite careful,

337
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:36,791
as he's developed a taste
for human meat.

338
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:37,666
Huh?

339
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:40,125
Next, we have Cleo Cazo,

340
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,541
Ratcatcher 2.

341
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:44,291
Settle down!

342
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:45,458
Ooh.

343
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,125
What, we couldn't
afford Ratcatcher 1?

344
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,666
He's dead.
This is his daughter.

345
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:51,291
Cazo, will you be joining us?

346
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,291
I just woke up.

347
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,625
I don't function well
early in the morning.

348
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,333
My deepest apologies
for disturbing you.

349
00:20:58,416 --> 00:20:59,458
Hmm, it's all right.

350
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,500
Get your ass out here!

351
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,041
Millennials.

352
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,583
Oh, no way.

353
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:18,041
- That's not coming with us.
- She controls rats.

354
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,208
I know, I caught that.
It's a disgusting superpower.

355
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:23,416
This is Sebastian.
Say hello, Sebastian.

356
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:27,791
I'm not shakin' the rat's hand.

357
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,791
And finally,
we have Abner Krill.

358
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,041
What's that 'round his neck?

359
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,250
A power dampener.

360
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,083
They call him the Polka Dot Man.

361
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:39,125
Polka Dot Man.

362
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,333
What's he do,
throw polka dots at people?

363
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:45,500
He does.

364
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,250
He throws polka dots at people.

365
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:48,708
Hey, Polka Dot Man,

366
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:51,041
I was hoping you'd entertain
my kid's birthday party.

367
00:21:51,125 --> 00:21:54,875
You fucking pussy!

368
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:56,916
These are soldiers?

369
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,625
We need to debrief.

370
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,750
Fuck.

371
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:10,916
Corto Maltese

372
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,541
is a small island nation off
the coast of South America.

373
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,125
Over the past 100 years,

374
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:19,000
the country has been ruled
with an iron fist

375
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:21,250
by the Herrera family.

376
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:24,916
But, a week ago, this guy,

377
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,583
General Silvio Luna,
along with his right-hand man,

378
00:22:28,666 --> 00:22:31,416
Mayor General Mateo Suarez,

379
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,083
took control of
the Corto Maltese government

380
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:36,416
in a violent military coup.

381
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:41,458
The entire Herrera family were
hanged in a public execution.

382
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:43,625
Although the United States
did not condone

383
00:22:43,708 --> 00:22:46,083
the excesses
of the Herrera regime,

384
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:49,125
they were non-antagonistic
toward the U.S.

385
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:53,416
Luna, however,
is virulently anti-American.

386
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,000
So, you want us to kill Luna?

387
00:22:55,083 --> 00:22:56,208
No.

388
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,791
This is Jotunheim.

389
00:22:58,875 --> 00:23:01,125
A scientific
experimentation facility

390
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:05,708
containing something known only
as Project Starfish.

391
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:07,666
Our intelligence sources tell us

392
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:11,125
that Starfish
is extraterrestrial in origin.

393
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:13,458
In the hands of the Luna regime,

394
00:23:13,541 --> 00:23:17,958
it is potentially cataclysmic
for Americans and the world.

395
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:22,333
Your mission
is to infiltrate Jotunheim

396
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:26,125
and destroy every trace
of Project Starfish.

397
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,500
How are we supposed to get in?

398
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:29,625
Gaius Grieves, the Thinker,

399
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:32,666
is a geneticist in charge
of Project Starfish.

400
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:35,791
After hours, he hangs out
at a gentlemen's club

401
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:38,625
known as La Gatita Amable.

402
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,625
Get Grieves to help you
by whatever means necessary

403
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:44,000
and he can get you
into Jotunheim.

404
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:46,250
Any questions?

405
00:23:48,375 --> 00:23:50,250
What is that?

406
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:52,625
That is an overhead projector.

407
00:23:52,708 --> 00:23:54,208
Do you ever use it anymore?

408
00:23:54,291 --> 00:23:55,583
No, not really.

409
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:57,666
So, why don't you
just throw it away?

410
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,458
Peacemaker?

411
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:02,333
Starfish is a slang term
for a butthole.

412
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:03,576
Think there's any connection?

413
00:24:06,208 --> 00:24:07,208
No.

414
00:24:08,583 --> 00:24:09,500
No...

415
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:10,458
Nanaue.

416
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:11,916
Connection.

417
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,208
Hand.

418
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:16,666
Yes, that is your hand,
Nanaue, very good.

419
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,208
We're all gonna die.

420
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:23,208
I hope so.

421
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:26,458
Oh, for fuck's sake.

422
00:24:50,208 --> 00:24:52,291
Control, we have a disturbance
south of here.

423
00:24:52,375 --> 00:24:54,166
<i>It's just
a diversion, Bloodsport.</i>

424
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:57,333
All right, we cut through the
jungle to get to Valle Del Mar.

425
00:24:57,416 --> 00:24:59,458
Don't they have blockades
at the city limits?

426
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:01,041
That's the word.

427
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,416
How we getting in? Especially
with Charlie the Tuna here.

428
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,916
How the hell am I
supposed to know?

429
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
You're the leader.

430
00:25:06,041 --> 00:25:07,458
You're supposed to be decisive.

431
00:25:07,541 --> 00:25:08,726
And I've decided
that you should eat

432
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,333
a big bag of dicks, how's that?

433
00:25:10,416 --> 00:25:12,375
You're being facetious,
but if this whole beach

434
00:25:12,458 --> 00:25:13,642
was completely covered in dicks

435
00:25:13,666 --> 00:25:15,083
and somebody said I had to eat

436
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:16,559
every dick until the beach
was clean for liberty,

437
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:18,041
I would say no problemo.

438
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:20,791
Why would someone put penises
all over the beach?

439
00:25:20,875 --> 00:25:22,184
Who knows why madmen
do what they do?

440
00:25:22,208 --> 00:25:23,458
Well, you know what I think?

441
00:25:23,541 --> 00:25:24,916
I think liberty
is just your excuse

442
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,583
to do whatever you want.

443
00:25:26,666 --> 00:25:29,500
Whether that's to eat a beach
full of dicks or killin' folk.

444
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,833
Oh, yeah?

445
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:37,833
At least I don't kill men
for money like you.

446
00:25:37,916 --> 00:25:39,416
Oh, here we go.

447
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,250
There's something wrong
with your skin.

448
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:43,416
It's just a rash.

449
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,875
That's a rash?

450
00:25:58,375 --> 00:25:59,458
Oh, no.

451
00:26:03,916 --> 00:26:05,125
You...

452
00:26:06,708 --> 00:26:08,041
are the only one...

453
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:13,041
fit to carry my javelin.

454
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:24,083
Carry it for...

455
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,041
Carry it for who?

456
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:49,625
For what? What the heck?

457
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:51,416
Who am I supposed
to carry it for?

458
00:26:53,958 --> 00:26:55,416
This is so frustratin'.

459
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,333
He just told me I have
to carry this javelin

460
00:26:57,416 --> 00:26:59,916
for a reason,
but he didn't say why!

461
00:27:01,666 --> 00:27:05,708
Waller? Waller. Waller!

462
00:27:15,291 --> 00:27:16,916
All right, we'll camp here,

463
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,960
and tomorrow we'll go
straight through to the city

464
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,500
to get to La Gatita Amable
by nightfall.

465
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:34,125
What?

466
00:28:52,458 --> 00:28:54,208
How deep of a sleeper are you?

467
00:28:54,291 --> 00:28:57,291
I was having
the most wonderful dream.

468
00:28:57,375 --> 00:28:59,458
If it was you about to be
eaten by King Shark,

469
00:28:59,541 --> 00:29:00,833
then you're psychic.

470
00:29:00,916 --> 00:29:02,142
I don't believe
he would do that.

471
00:29:02,166 --> 00:29:04,291
He has very kind eyes.

472
00:29:07,708 --> 00:29:10,208
Hungry.

473
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:11,583
You bastard!

474
00:29:12,958 --> 00:29:15,083
Uh...

475
00:29:26,708 --> 00:29:28,666
All right,
calm down with the rats!

476
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,000
- What?
- I have a thing with rats.

477
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:32,833
- You have a thing with rats?
- Yes.

478
00:29:32,916 --> 00:29:35,750
- And you're on a team with me?
- Not something I asked for!

479
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:38,351
What are you
laughing at me for, man?

480
00:29:38,375 --> 00:29:39,767
Why the fuck are you
in your underwear?

481
00:29:39,791 --> 00:29:41,083
Tighty-whities? Really?

482
00:29:41,166 --> 00:29:42,583
- Now, that's just racist.
- No.

483
00:29:42,666 --> 00:29:44,291
<i>It's not racist.</i>

484
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:46,184
<i>- They're tighty-whities.</i>
- Oh, come the fuck on.

485
00:29:46,208 --> 00:29:48,875
Bloodsport's got a rat phobia.

486
00:29:48,958 --> 00:29:50,958
What?

487
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:52,083
You didn't tell me

488
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:54,166
<i>you had a fear of rats, Dubois?</i>

489
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:57,083
I'm an assassin! Why would I
share my liabilities?

490
00:29:58,333 --> 00:29:59,583
For fuck's sake.

491
00:29:59,666 --> 00:30:01,375
Aw. He's offering you
a pretty leaf

492
00:30:01,458 --> 00:30:03,541
to show you he means no harm.

493
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:04,905
Why the fuck
would I want a leaf?

494
00:30:06,916 --> 00:30:08,250
Just get the rats out of here!

495
00:30:13,916 --> 00:30:17,041
- Oh, fuck's sake.
- Huh. Cool.

496
00:30:20,833 --> 00:30:22,593
Hey, we gonna kill
Megalodouche now, or what?

497
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:24,458
<i>Nanaue's the strongest
member of your team.</i>

498
00:30:24,541 --> 00:30:26,666
You need him
to get into Jotunheim.

499
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,333
Yeah, well,
we can't function as a team

500
00:30:28,416 --> 00:30:29,708
if we gotta watch our back

501
00:30:29,791 --> 00:30:31,351
from one of our own
eatin' our bollocks.

502
00:30:32,833 --> 00:30:37,208
Nanaue,
would you eat your friends?

503
00:30:38,708 --> 00:30:40,583
I no friends.

504
00:30:41,541 --> 00:30:43,250
You have no friends?

505
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:49,541
If you did, would you eat them?

506
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:50,708
Yes.

507
00:30:56,208 --> 00:30:58,333
No?

508
00:30:58,416 --> 00:31:00,791
Then, can we be your friends?

509
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,041
Come on.

510
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:04,250
He's obviously lying.

511
00:31:07,708 --> 00:31:10,000
If I die
'cause I gambled on love,

512
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:13,375
it will be a worthy death.

513
00:31:15,166 --> 00:31:16,166
Friends.

514
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,958
You are a little idiot.

515
00:31:35,083 --> 00:31:38,750
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
I'm good at my job.

516
00:31:38,833 --> 00:31:39,916
I found him.

517
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Check it out.

518
00:31:41,958 --> 00:31:43,916
Look, right here, a mile north.

519
00:31:45,208 --> 00:31:46,458
Task Force X,

520
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:47,976
you have an additional
mission directive.

521
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,875
<i>We've located Colonel Rick Flag.</i>

522
00:31:49,958 --> 00:31:51,333
<i>He's been taken by the enemy.</i>

523
00:31:51,416 --> 00:31:52,333
Rick Flag?

524
00:31:52,416 --> 00:31:53,916
<i>I know, you both served</i>

525
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,333
on special forces in Qurac
that took down Avral Kaddam.

526
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,583
<i>Flag was the one
who initially recommended you.</i>

527
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:01,666
You had other operatives
in Corto Maltese

528
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,625
and didn't tell us?

529
00:32:03,708 --> 00:32:07,083
<i>There was no tactical
advantage, now there is.</i>

530
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:09,875
<i>I've uploaded the location
on your MTS.</i>

531
00:32:09,958 --> 00:32:14,333
<i>Terminate his captors
with extreme prejudice.</i>

532
00:32:14,416 --> 00:32:18,708
<i>Kill anyone you see.
These are dangerous people.</i>

533
00:32:18,791 --> 00:32:21,541
<i>Recover Flag before moving on
to the city.</i>

534
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:28,625
That's where
they're holding Flag.

535
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:31,541
Nothing like a bloodbath
to start the day.

536
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:33,000
They call you Peacemaker?

537
00:32:33,083 --> 00:32:35,208
I cherish peace
with all my heart.

538
00:32:35,291 --> 00:32:36,571
I don't care
how many men, women,

539
00:32:36,625 --> 00:32:38,125
and children
I need to kill to get it.

540
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:41,458
I thought
you were the crazy one.

541
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:43,541
I am.

542
00:32:43,625 --> 00:32:45,166
All right.

543
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,458
Let's get it.

544
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,291
Boss.

545
00:32:50,958 --> 00:32:51,958
<i>Gracias.</i>

546
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,750
No, no, no!

547
00:34:39,333 --> 00:34:40,333
No, no, no!

548
00:35:05,083 --> 00:35:06,083
Hmm?

549
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:11,416
Non-lethal.

550
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,875
You lose.

551
00:35:12,958 --> 00:35:14,750
Exploding compression bullets.

552
00:35:18,625 --> 00:35:20,000
No one likes a show-off.

553
00:35:20,083 --> 00:35:22,625
Unless what they're
showing off is dope as fuck.

554
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:27,583
Fuck. That's true.

555
00:35:42,958 --> 00:35:44,791
He does throw
polka dots at people.

556
00:35:45,958 --> 00:35:48,333
I'm sorry it's so...
flamboyant.

557
00:35:48,416 --> 00:35:51,041
It looks cool. I think.

558
00:35:51,125 --> 00:35:52,375
I don't like to kill people,

559
00:35:52,458 --> 00:35:54,666
but if I pretend
they're my mom, it's easy.

560
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:56,500
T.M.I., mate.

561
00:36:05,291 --> 00:36:06,291
Dubois?

562
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:07,916
Hey, Flag.

563
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:11,541
What the hell
are you doing here?

564
00:36:11,625 --> 00:36:13,708
Waller told us that you were...

565
00:36:14,666 --> 00:36:15,666
Uh...

566
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,625
Are you drinkin' tea?

567
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:19,083
This is Sol Soria,

568
00:36:19,166 --> 00:36:20,766
she's the leader
of the freedom fighters,

569
00:36:20,833 --> 00:36:23,166
the resistance trying to take
down the current government.

570
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,750
They saved my life.

571
00:36:25,791 --> 00:36:28,041
Oh, wow.

572
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:32,625
Why did my people not alert me
of your arrival?

573
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,250
We didn't see any people.

574
00:36:36,333 --> 00:36:37,250
Yeah, I didn't see
anybody on the way...

575
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:38,416
There's no one out there.

576
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,083
They were gone when we got here.

577
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:42,366
I turned them into my mother
in my head and killed them.

578
00:36:58,166 --> 00:37:03,125
Typical Americans.
Just run in, guns blazing.

579
00:37:03,208 --> 00:37:05,333
I know, this is messed up.

580
00:37:05,416 --> 00:37:07,625
- These guys, they're...
- What's this one do?

581
00:37:08,583 --> 00:37:10,500
They're fucking idiots,

582
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:14,000
but right now our objectives
align with yours.

583
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:16,750
If Jotunheim
contains the technology

584
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:18,291
our intelligence says it does,

585
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:20,309
then it could be used
on the people of Corto Maltese

586
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:21,666
as well as Americans.

587
00:37:23,291 --> 00:37:24,583
That's why we need your help

588
00:37:24,666 --> 00:37:26,625
to get into the city
so we can stop 'em.

589
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:30,375
Is that rat waving at me?

590
00:37:36,291 --> 00:37:37,375
It appears it is.

591
00:37:38,666 --> 00:37:40,000
Why?

592
00:37:40,083 --> 00:37:41,916
I'm gonna guess
because it's friendly.

593
00:37:44,916 --> 00:37:47,458
Luna and Suarez
murdered my entire family.

594
00:37:49,375 --> 00:37:52,083
I'd make a deal
with the Devil to stop them.

595
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:58,333
Your people will have our help
getting to Valle Del Mar

596
00:37:58,416 --> 00:38:02,916
to apprehend this Gaius Grieves.

597
00:38:18,541 --> 00:38:19,708
Hey.

598
00:38:19,791 --> 00:38:22,041
- What is this?
- You slaughtered my staff!

599
00:38:22,125 --> 00:38:24,875
They were loyal to the Herreras.

600
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:27,291
Who are you loyal to, Thinker?

601
00:38:27,375 --> 00:38:30,041
They call you "Thinker," yes?

602
00:38:30,125 --> 00:38:33,333
All that shit in your face
is to make your brain good?

603
00:38:33,416 --> 00:38:36,166
Yes, makes my brain good.

604
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,541
Are you being sarcastic with me?

605
00:38:39,791 --> 00:38:41,041
Hey! Hey.

606
00:38:41,125 --> 00:38:42,559
I shall do to you
as we did to your employees.

607
00:38:42,583 --> 00:38:43,583
Hey. Mateo!

608
00:38:50,291 --> 00:38:51,583
What is this?

609
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:55,750
Project Starfish.

610
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,541
It's been the primary focus
of my experiments here

611
00:38:58,625 --> 00:39:01,250
for the past 30 years.

612
00:39:07,458 --> 00:39:10,208
Here.
What... What is it doing here?

613
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:12,625
Oh!

614
00:39:12,708 --> 00:39:15,125
It is having little babies.

615
00:39:15,208 --> 00:39:16,541
Not progeny,

616
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:19,041
extensions of itself.

617
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,916
They take hosts,

618
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,083
and those hosts in turn become
part of the central being.

619
00:39:27,375 --> 00:39:30,041
It feeds
on their consciousnesses.

620
00:39:31,333 --> 00:39:34,875
Grows larger, more powerful.

621
00:39:41,208 --> 00:39:42,458
So...

622
00:39:46,208 --> 00:39:48,208
where is
this Project Starfish now?

623
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:19,750
Marvelous idea, Presidente.

624
00:40:21,791 --> 00:40:23,166
But as I've noted,

625
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:26,791
I've been working
with the beast for 30 years.

626
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:30,625
And there's no one but me
capable of controlling it.

627
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:32,500
Well, then...

628
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,916
welcome to the team.

629
00:40:42,916 --> 00:40:43,833
<i>Si,</i> Camila.

630
00:40:43,916 --> 00:40:45,500
Presidente.

631
00:40:50,541 --> 00:40:52,375
You are making a big mistake

632
00:40:52,458 --> 00:40:53,583
throwing me down here!

633
00:40:53,666 --> 00:40:55,000
I will be outta here soon enough

634
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:57,916
and I will kill
every last one of you,

635
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,875
Colto Maltese-tezios.
Maltese-els.

636
00:41:01,958 --> 00:41:04,375
Malte-multoids. Colt-a-mults?

637
00:41:04,458 --> 00:41:07,250
Whatever you<i> Mario Kart-racing</i>
d-bags are called!

638
00:41:08,375 --> 00:41:09,625
Please.

639
00:41:10,541 --> 00:41:11,541
Put this on.

640
00:41:24,333 --> 00:41:25,625
Oh, wow.

641
00:41:29,958 --> 00:41:31,291
I'm a princess.

642
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,916
<i>Senorita</i> Quinn,

643
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,750
on behalf of the entire staff
of Our Honorable General

644
00:41:58,833 --> 00:42:00,958
Presidente Silvio
Eleuterio Luna,

645
00:42:01,041 --> 00:42:02,750
it's a pleasure to serve you.

646
00:42:03,833 --> 00:42:04,875
<i>Gracias.</i>

647
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:10,666
My mother said
to count back again.

648
00:42:11,416 --> 00:42:12,750
Ten, nine,

649
00:42:12,833 --> 00:42:15,083
eight, seven, six,

650
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:17,375
five, four, three,

651
00:42:17,458 --> 00:42:22,583
two, one. Ha!
Coronel, beat that...

652
00:42:28,291 --> 00:42:29,458
Oh.

653
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:32,166
Forgive my appearance,
<i>Senorita</i> Quinn.

654
00:42:33,791 --> 00:42:36,833
I have admired you from afar

655
00:42:36,916 --> 00:42:38,666
for many years now.

656
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:41,000
<i>Senorita.</i>

657
00:42:42,375 --> 00:42:43,583
Me?

658
00:42:43,666 --> 00:42:46,875
You're a hero to me,
as well as to my people.

659
00:42:46,958 --> 00:42:49,500
I think you might
got me confused.

660
00:42:49,583 --> 00:42:51,250
Harley Quinn's fire
and rebellion

661
00:42:51,333 --> 00:42:52,833
in the face
of American oppression

662
00:42:52,916 --> 00:42:54,796
is something to which
my entire country aspires.

663
00:42:54,875 --> 00:42:56,166
Oh.

664
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:57,708
I have prepared lunch.

665
00:42:59,416 --> 00:43:01,083
Would you be so kind
as to join me?

666
00:43:03,208 --> 00:43:04,791
I'm so kind, sure.

You want me to what?

679
00:44:07,666 --> 00:44:08,875
To marry me.

680
00:44:08,958 --> 00:44:10,166
You're joshing.

681
00:44:11,291 --> 00:44:13,166
Might I be frank, Harley?

682
00:44:13,916 --> 00:44:14,916
You might be.

683
00:44:17,041 --> 00:44:18,416
Good, listen.

684
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:21,333
Since I took control,
the majority love me.

685
00:44:21,416 --> 00:44:25,458
But some find me to be

686
00:44:25,541 --> 00:44:27,208
an unacceptable leader.

687
00:44:27,291 --> 00:44:30,333
What kinds of dicks
would find that?

688
00:44:30,416 --> 00:44:32,625
Don't they know
how awesome you are?

689
00:44:32,708 --> 00:44:34,166
Have you shown them the birdies?

690
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:35,875
It may sound archaic

691
00:44:35,958 --> 00:44:38,000
to someone
from your part of the world,

692
00:44:38,083 --> 00:44:39,750
but my people,
the Corto Malteseans,

693
00:44:39,833 --> 00:44:41,416
they're very old-fashioned.

694
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:43,291
Corto Malteseans, of course.

695
00:44:43,375 --> 00:44:45,666
And I am a bachelor.

696
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:47,458
So they want you to get hitched?

697
00:44:47,541 --> 00:44:50,166
My people say you would
make the perfect wife.

698
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,166
Because, you know,

699
00:44:52,250 --> 00:44:54,166
you symbolize
anti-American fervor.

700
00:44:55,666 --> 00:44:56,666
Oh.

701
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,125
But I am a romantic, Harley.

702
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:03,166
I agreed to meet with you
just to appease them.

703
00:45:04,666 --> 00:45:09,083
However, upon spending
the day with you,

704
00:45:09,166 --> 00:45:13,250
I find myself hardly able
to think straight.

705
00:45:13,333 --> 00:45:16,458
- You are perfect in every...
- You are so freaking hot.

Harley Luna.

712
00:45:45,541 --> 00:45:47,083
I like the ring of that.

713
00:46:12,166 --> 00:46:13,625
That's Jotunheim?

714
00:46:16,041 --> 00:46:20,625
Nazis came here seeking asylum
after World War II.

715
00:46:22,166 --> 00:46:25,083
They built Jotunheim to continue

716
00:46:25,166 --> 00:46:28,500
their unorthodox experiments.

717
00:46:28,583 --> 00:46:32,250
Until the Herrera family accepted
the bounty on the Nazis' heads

718
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:34,166
and killed them all.

719
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:35,583
Wowza.

720
00:46:35,666 --> 00:46:39,041
Many years ago,
the rumors began of a beast.

721
00:46:39,125 --> 00:46:43,041
These dark rumors helped the
Herrera family maintain power.

722
00:46:43,125 --> 00:46:44,476
They would send
their political enemies

723
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,750
and their families
to the fortress,

724
00:46:46,833 --> 00:46:48,166
never to return.

725
00:46:49,041 --> 00:46:53,041
I have recently learned

726
00:46:53,125 --> 00:46:55,083
these were not rumors.

727
00:46:55,166 --> 00:46:57,375
They were murdering thousands

728
00:46:57,458 --> 00:47:00,958
in bizarre experiments
with this creature.

729
00:47:02,458 --> 00:47:03,601
Well, it must be a big relief

730
00:47:03,625 --> 00:47:06,041
to got it
in your hands now, huh?

731
00:47:06,125 --> 00:47:08,166
Absolutely.

732
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:11,708
Now, it is our enemies
who shall be fearful.

733
00:47:13,625 --> 00:47:16,291
If anyone dares
to say a negative word

734
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,500
about their new president today,

735
00:47:18,583 --> 00:47:23,416
their parents, their children,
and anyone they ever loved

736
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:26,666
will be sent to Jotunheim
to feed the beast.

737
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:29,875
I'm sorry.

738
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,916
Recently, I made
a promise to myself

739
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,440
that the next time
I got a boyfriend,

740
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,125
I'd be on the lookout
for red flags.

741
00:47:38,208 --> 00:47:39,416
And if I saw any,

742
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:40,750
I would do the healthy thing

743
00:47:41,708 --> 00:47:43,250
and I would murder him.

744
00:47:45,833 --> 00:47:47,125
And killing kids?

745
00:47:48,791 --> 00:47:50,083
Kind of a red flag.

746
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:52,875
I know, I know.

747
00:47:52,958 --> 00:47:54,101
I know what
you're tryin' to say.

748
00:47:54,125 --> 00:47:55,708
"Harley, why not just leave?"

749
00:47:55,791 --> 00:47:57,791
And I'd say,
"Why are you screaming at me?"

750
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,875
"I'm not deaf.
I'm standing right here."

751
00:47:59,958 --> 00:48:02,291
And then I'd say,

752
00:48:02,375 --> 00:48:05,833
"When your taste in men
is as bad as mine,

753
00:48:07,166 --> 00:48:09,666
they don't just go away quietly.

754
00:48:11,166 --> 00:48:13,833
"They slash your tires
and they kill your dogs and

755
00:48:13,916 --> 00:48:15,625
tell you that the music you like

756
00:48:15,708 --> 00:48:17,583
ain't real music at all."

757
00:48:17,666 --> 00:48:18,750
And all the cruelty...

758
00:48:25,708 --> 00:48:27,625
tears you apart after a while.

759
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:43,375
You were real pretty and all,

760
00:48:43,458 --> 00:48:46,833
and R.I.P. to that absolutely
beautiful monster

761
00:48:46,916 --> 00:48:48,291
between your legs, but...

762
00:48:49,458 --> 00:48:50,583
all in all...

763
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:55,500
I think you're
more pretty like this,

764
00:48:55,583 --> 00:48:58,750
with all those rotten thoughts
emptied from your head.

765
00:49:02,083 --> 00:49:03,958
I can't believe
this thing had a bullet.

766
00:49:08,083 --> 00:49:11,541
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got it.

767
00:50:28,541 --> 00:50:30,083
What the hell are you doin'?

768
00:50:31,458 --> 00:50:34,416
We're tired,
Colonel. We need a rest.

769
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,583
Goddamn hobbyists.

770
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:38,041
We cannot stop.

771
00:50:38,125 --> 00:50:39,601
We need to hurry if you're
going to help my people.

772
00:50:39,625 --> 00:50:41,625
Hey. We're not here
to help your people.

773
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:43,916
But she's right,
we gotta keep moving.

774
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,125
I carry friend?

775
00:50:46,208 --> 00:50:48,541
It's okay, Nanaue.

776
00:50:51,375 --> 00:50:53,416
It's happening
to his face again.

777
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,083
- It's nothing, I slipped.
- Hey...

778
00:50:55,166 --> 00:50:58,458
Norman Bates, if that shit's
contagious, we need to know.

779
00:50:58,541 --> 00:51:00,625
It's not.

780
00:51:00,708 --> 00:51:02,208
- What is it?
- It's a...

781
00:51:05,041 --> 00:51:06,916
It's an inter dimensional virus.

782
00:51:09,375 --> 00:51:10,583
Fuck is that?

783
00:51:11,791 --> 00:51:14,041
My mother was a scientist
at S.T.A.R. Labs,

784
00:51:14,125 --> 00:51:15,625
and she was obsessed
with turning me

785
00:51:15,708 --> 00:51:18,125
and my brothers and sisters
into superheroes.

786
00:51:20,375 --> 00:51:22,375
She infected me.

787
00:51:22,458 --> 00:51:25,458
Now, if I don't, you know,
expel the dots twice a day...

788
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:27,458
Then what?

789
00:51:29,583 --> 00:51:32,625
They'll eat me alive.

790
00:51:32,708 --> 00:51:34,708
What happened
to your brothers and sisters?

791
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:38,500
Some lived.

792
00:51:39,125 --> 00:51:40,125
Some...

793
00:51:42,541 --> 00:51:43,541
died.

794
00:51:44,541 --> 00:51:47,208
And your mom, where is she now?

795
00:51:52,458 --> 00:51:53,625
Everywhere.

796
00:52:01,041 --> 00:52:04,041
Okay. Let's move out.

797
00:52:04,125 --> 00:52:05,500
Come on, we must hurry,

798
00:52:05,583 --> 00:52:07,583
or we'll be late
to meet my contact.

through town

806
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:32,708
and to La Gatita Amable.

807
00:53:32,791 --> 00:53:34,551
There are clothes in the boxes
for all of you

808
00:53:34,625 --> 00:53:36,000
so you can blend in.

809
00:53:36,083 --> 00:53:38,833
That said, the walking<i> tiburon</i>

810
00:53:38,916 --> 00:53:40,583
is gonna have
to stay out of sight.

811
00:53:40,666 --> 00:53:42,666
I wear disguise.

812
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:46,000
Oh, you're going
to wear a disguise.

813
00:53:46,083 --> 00:53:46,958
<i>Si.</i>

814
00:53:47,041 --> 00:53:48,291
Hey, he's learnin' Spanish.

815
00:53:48,375 --> 00:53:50,791
And what kind of disguise?

816
00:53:50,875 --> 00:53:52,958
- Fake mustache.
- Oh.

817
00:53:53,041 --> 00:53:56,000
Yeah, fake mustache
isn't gonna cut it, mate.

818
00:54:00,208 --> 00:54:02,541
There's gonna be a lot of
soldiers watching Jotunheim.

819
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:05,125
If they discover us there...

820
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:07,500
Let's pray they do not,
or you will all be dead.

821
00:54:07,583 --> 00:54:09,083
If they do,

822
00:54:09,166 --> 00:54:10,916
that'll leave
the palace vulnerable.

823
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:14,500
Luna and the other generals

824
00:54:14,583 --> 00:54:16,000
will be left without protection.

825
00:54:23,958 --> 00:54:26,125
You're a good man, Colonel Flag.

826
00:54:30,541 --> 00:54:32,333
You still look
exactly like yourself.

827
00:54:32,416 --> 00:54:34,059
That's the worst fake
mustache I've ever seen.

828
00:54:34,083 --> 00:54:36,666
And if you had fooled us,
we'd have to kill you,

829
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:38,666
shark-shaped bloke
with a moustache

830
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:40,000
creeping up on us like that.

831
00:54:40,083 --> 00:54:41,375
Fuck!

832
00:54:42,583 --> 00:54:44,083
You, you.

833
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:49,250
Aw.

834
00:54:49,333 --> 00:54:52,333
He always wants to be near you.

835
00:54:52,416 --> 00:54:53,958
I think he senses good in you.

836
00:54:54,041 --> 00:54:56,041
Yeah, there's no good in me.

837
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,750
Damn.

838
00:55:02,833 --> 00:55:04,767
Supposed to play golf with
Senator Cray this weekend.

839
00:55:04,791 --> 00:55:06,416
I'm gonna look a fool.

840
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,208
<i>Waller, come in.</i>

841
00:55:09,666 --> 00:55:10,875
Ugh.

842
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:12,666
You missed.

843
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:14,083
<i>Waller, do you copy?</i>

844
00:55:14,166 --> 00:55:15,541
We're losing connection.

845
00:55:17,333 --> 00:55:18,375
Waller.

846
00:55:20,791 --> 00:55:21,875
Fuck's sake.

847
00:55:21,958 --> 00:55:23,583
- <i>Task Force X.</i>
- Waller.

848
00:55:23,666 --> 00:55:25,375
<i>You there?</i>

849
00:55:25,458 --> 00:55:26,708
<i>The military must have put</i>

850
00:55:26,791 --> 00:55:28,916
signal jammers around the city.

851
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,125
Your comms are down,

852
00:55:30,208 --> 00:55:31,601
but we can still activate
the bombs,

853
00:55:31,625 --> 00:55:33,750
not to mention what will
happen to your daughter.

854
00:55:33,833 --> 00:55:35,958
So, no funny business.

855
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,666
<i>Do you copy, Dubois?</i>

856
00:55:38,291 --> 00:55:39,291
Copy.

857
00:55:39,333 --> 00:55:41,500
Fuck you!

858
00:55:41,583 --> 00:55:44,333
Hey, uh, all that stuff
about his daughter,

859
00:55:44,416 --> 00:55:47,083
you wouldn't
really do that, right?

860
00:55:47,166 --> 00:55:49,916
You don't know half
of what I would do, John.

861
00:56:10,583 --> 00:56:12,333
What?

862
00:56:12,416 --> 00:56:15,208
Why are you so afraid of rats?

863
00:56:17,708 --> 00:56:19,750
Why are you so in love
with them, Ratcatcher 2?

864
00:56:21,625 --> 00:56:23,041
You know what I think?

865
00:56:23,125 --> 00:56:25,416
I think you have a serious
case of daddy issues.

866
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:29,000
I have no issues with
how much I loved my father.

867
00:56:37,875 --> 00:56:39,666
Although he was a genius...

868
00:56:42,375 --> 00:56:45,958
we lived homeless in the
streets of Portugal 'cause of his...

869
00:56:49,375 --> 00:56:50,458
burdens.

870
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:56,000
He built the machines
I employ today...

871
00:56:57,541 --> 00:57:00,041
and taught me the secrets
of calling the rats.

872
00:57:04,166 --> 00:57:06,583
They brought us
trinkets to live on.

873
00:57:07,875 --> 00:57:09,750
And they kept us warm at night,

874
00:57:09,833 --> 00:57:11,333
when we would have frozen.

875
00:57:14,583 --> 00:57:16,916
- But eventually...
<i>- Papa.</i>

876
00:57:17,791 --> 00:57:19,083
<i>Papa, wake up.</i>

877
00:57:19,166 --> 00:57:21,500
My father's burdens

878
00:57:21,583 --> 00:57:24,000
became too heavy to carry.

879
00:57:24,083 --> 00:57:25,500
<i>No.</i>

880
00:57:25,583 --> 00:57:26,666
<i>No, Papa.</i>

881
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:28,875
- And he was gone.
<i>- Papa, wake up.</i>

882
00:57:34,541 --> 00:57:37,875
I took his machinery
and came to America.

883
00:57:37,958 --> 00:57:39,625
That is the dream, right?

884
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:43,458
But I was arrested

885
00:57:43,541 --> 00:57:46,208
for armed bank robbery,
do you believe it?

886
00:57:46,291 --> 00:57:48,583
The state considered
the rats a weapon.

887
00:57:52,125 --> 00:57:53,166
What?

888
00:57:56,125 --> 00:57:57,916
You remind me of my daughter,

889
00:57:59,291 --> 00:58:00,625
the reason I'm here.

890
00:58:02,333 --> 00:58:05,041
Why are you so afraid of rats?

891
00:58:05,916 --> 00:58:06,958
My old man.

892
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:10,125
When I was a lad,

893
00:58:10,208 --> 00:58:12,375
if I didn't finish a task right,

894
00:58:12,458 --> 00:58:15,541
he would dole out
the punishment.

895
00:58:15,625 --> 00:58:20,375
And one day, he just locked me
in a crate for 24 hours.

896
00:58:22,625 --> 00:58:24,958
And it was
full of starvin' rats.

897
00:58:26,875 --> 00:58:29,208
As imperfect my father was...

898
00:58:33,208 --> 00:58:34,416
he loved me.

899
00:58:38,666 --> 00:58:40,458
I wish I could give that to you.

900
00:58:44,041 --> 00:58:46,000
Don't you worry, yeah?

901
00:58:46,083 --> 00:58:48,708
I'm gonna get you
out of here alive.

902
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:51,541
I'm going to get you
out of here alive.

Yup.

out back that's looking

01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:49,250
What?

967
01:03:49,291 --> 01:03:51,416
Ow!

968
01:03:56,500 --> 01:04:00,416
- Come on. Go.
- He...

969
01:04:02,875 --> 01:04:04,916
Oh, God.

970
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,000
Move it!

971
01:04:08,041 --> 01:04:09,041
Come on!

972
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:11,416
Hey!

973
01:04:23,333 --> 01:04:24,416
Your equipment

974
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:25,900
manipulates
animal behavior, clever.

975
01:04:25,958 --> 01:04:28,250
I'm working on something
similar with humans.

976
01:04:28,333 --> 01:04:29,833
Be quiet, please.

977
01:04:29,916 --> 01:04:31,583
You are perceivably panicked.

978
01:04:31,666 --> 01:04:33,851
I'm guessing that you are not
the alphas of this battalion.

979
01:04:33,875 --> 01:04:37,750
Do you want a dozen angry
rodents crawling up your ass?

980
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:39,541
My answer might not
be what you expect.

981
01:04:41,625 --> 01:04:42,958
Go, go!

984
01:04:57,291 --> 01:04:59,291
I'm sorry for you.

985
01:04:59,375 --> 01:05:00,655
But soon you will all be joining

986
01:05:00,708 --> 01:05:03,541
your deranged compatriot,
Harley Quinn.

987
01:05:05,333 --> 01:05:06,666
Is Harley alive?

988
01:05:06,750 --> 01:05:08,333
Not for long.

989
01:05:08,416 --> 01:05:11,000
Mayor General Suarez
can be rather harsh

990
01:05:11,083 --> 01:05:12,916
when extracting information.

<i>Dim mak.</i>

01:05:34,208 --> 01:05:35,666
That's
the Cantonese term for it.

993
01:05:35,750 --> 01:05:38,166
In Japan, it's<i> kyoshu jitsu.</i>

994
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:42,416
In English,
it's simply the Death Touch,

995
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:44,500
how to kill a man
with a single blow.

996
01:05:45,416 --> 01:05:47,250
Of course it's possible

997
01:05:47,333 --> 01:05:49,125
to kill a man
with a single blow.

998
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:52,500
But it's a matter of chance,

999
01:05:52,583 --> 01:05:54,666
and cannot be wielded
with certainty.

1000
01:05:56,083 --> 01:05:58,791
- That's what they say.
- They?

1001
01:05:58,875 --> 01:06:00,083
- Amateurs.
- On one?

1002
01:06:00,166 --> 01:06:01,166
One.

1003
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:07,583

I will ask again.

1013
01:08:28,041 --> 01:08:30,208
How many meta-power teammates

1014
01:08:30,291 --> 01:08:32,833
arrived with you
to Corto Maltese?

1015
01:08:34,875 --> 01:08:36,208
Sixty-nine.

1016

You're gonna risk
the entire mission

1022
01:09:36,833 --> 01:09:38,684
for a mental defective
dressed as a court jester.

1023
01:09:38,708 --> 01:09:40,559
This coming from a guy that
wears a toilet seat on his head.

1024
01:09:40,583 --> 01:09:42,041
We don't leave
one of our own behind.

1025

You're okay with this?

1026
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:45,476
No, but I've been around Flag
when he's got a rag in his mouth.

01:09:45,500 --> 01:09:46,940
- Best not to tug it.
- Motherfucker!

1028

Hey, wake up, wake up.

1029
01:09:50,250 --> 01:09:51,541
All right, let's go.

1030
01:09:55,000 --> 01:09:56,726
All right, we'll enter
through the third floor,

1031
01:09:56,750 --> 01:09:59,083
go to the inner staircase,
and then down to the cellar

1032
01:09:59,166 --> 01:10:00,517
where they usually
keep their detainees.

1033
01:10:00,541 --> 01:10:02,541
Hopefully, Harley's still alive.

1034

it's a beacon of freedom!

You were gonna... save me?

1077
01:15:26,958 --> 01:15:29,916
It was a really good plan, too.

1078
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:32,500
Well, I can go back inside,
and you can still do it.

1079
01:15:32,583 --> 01:15:34,083
That's patronizing.

1080
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,416
Yeah, no, it's not...

1081
01:15:38,083 --> 01:15:40,416

1083
01:15:41,958 --> 01:15:43,583
- Jesus Christ.
- Yeah.

1084
01:15:43,666 --> 01:15:46,750
Or Him. Or any of them, really.

1085
01:15:46,833 --> 01:15:47,916
Okay.

1086
01:15:48,791 --> 01:15:49,833

01:15:54,791 --> 01:15:56,041
Bloodsport.

1091
01:16:00,875 --> 01:16:04,041
All right, who ate
all the fucking empanadas?

1092
01:16:04,125 --> 01:16:05,291
Mine were very good.

1093
01:16:05,375 --> 01:16:06,458
I had the chicken.

1094
01:16:07,541 --> 01:16:09,041
All right,

1095
01:16:09,125 --> 01:16:11,958
here's the deal.
We fail the mission, you die.

1096
01:16:12,041 --> 01:16:15,041
We find out any information
you give us is false, you die.

1097
01:16:15,125 --> 01:16:18,958
If we find out you have
personalized license plates, you die.

1098
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:20,125
What? No.

1099
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:22,500
If you mismatch blacks, you die.

1100
01:16:22,583 --> 01:16:23,791
No.

1101
01:16:23,875 --> 01:16:25,226
If you cough without
covering your mouth...

1102
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:27,125
Harley. Those last three
aren't things.

1103
01:16:27,208 --> 01:16:29,250
Although, probably
don't need to say this,

1104
01:16:29,333 --> 01:16:30,666
but that isn't
an open invitation

1105
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:32,392
for you to cough
without covering your mouth.

1106
01:16:32,416 --> 01:16:34,184
All right, we're gonna need
you to drive the minibus,

1107
01:16:34,208 --> 01:16:36,541
with all of us inside, past
the guards at the front gate.

1108
01:16:36,625 --> 01:16:39,465
Once through the gate, we'll use
you to get through the retinal scanner.

1109
01:16:39,541 --> 01:16:41,666
There are security cameras
everywhere.

1110
01:16:41,750 --> 01:16:43,208
They're being dealt with.

1111
01:16:54,083 --> 01:16:56,500
We'll neutralize the soldiers
there and enter.

1112
01:16:56,583 --> 01:16:59,166
Once we're inside,
we separate into teams.

1113
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:01,166
I am walking back and forth.

1114
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:04,625
Okay. You're gonna lead me and
Ratcatcher 2 to Project Starfish.

1115
01:17:04,708 --> 01:17:06,601
I'm going with you
'cause I don't trust this guy.

1116
01:17:06,625 --> 01:17:08,375
No, no, no,
you're coming with me.

1117
01:17:08,458 --> 01:17:10,875
Our munitions expertise are
needed to place the explosives,

1118
01:17:10,958 --> 01:17:13,875
starting at the first floor,
going all the way to the top.

1119
01:17:13,958 --> 01:17:16,916
Once we're clear, we blow
the tits off that thing,

1120
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,166
and go home.

1121
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:20,625
This is suicide.

1122
01:17:20,708 --> 01:17:22,166
Well, that's kind of our thing.

1123
01:17:23,375 --> 01:17:24,375
Yeah.

1124
01:17:30,958 --> 01:17:32,791
This is insane.

1125

1126
01:18:15,875 --> 01:18:17,125
Yeah, no.

1127
01:18:23,041 --> 01:18:24,750
I love the rain.

1128
01:18:24,833 --> 01:18:27,416
It's like angels
are splooging all over us.

1129
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:29,208
It's good for cover.

01:18:29,291 --> 01:18:30,458
Yep, that too.

You son of a bit...

1148
01:20:07,791 --> 01:20:10,833
Input
the emergency code. Now!

1149
01:20:10,916 --> 01:20:12,291
Well, go on then!

1150
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:38,416
Yo!

1151
01:20:39,875 --> 01:20:40,875
Okay, Pokey.

1152
01:20:40,958 --> 01:20:43,250
You get a bomb, you get a bomb.

1153
01:20:43,333 --> 01:20:45,458
Harley and I will meet
you up on the second floor.

1154
01:20:45,541 --> 01:20:47,166
Yeah? All right.

1155
01:21:29,916 --> 01:21:31,875
God damn it, Nanaue.

1156
01:21:33,250 --> 01:21:34,750
No!

1157
01:21:34,833 --> 01:21:36,208
Quit bein' a play baby.

1158
01:21:36,916 --> 01:21:38,458
Peacemaker.

1159
01:21:39,666 --> 01:21:41,166
It's actually very nice.

1160
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:42,875
Just put it against the wall.

1161
01:21:44,750 --> 01:21:46,375
It looks nothin' like me.

1162
01:21:46,458 --> 01:21:47,750
Move. Move it.

1163
01:21:50,791 --> 01:21:51,916
This way.

1164
01:22:12,583 --> 01:22:13,833
<i>Si.</i>

1165
01:22:19,916 --> 01:22:22,458
<i>Vamonos. Vamonos!</i>

1166
01:23:04,750 --> 01:23:06,083
Good God.

1167
01:23:06,166 --> 01:23:07,666
If God existed,

1168
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:10,583
wouldn't this be proof
that he wasn't good at all?

1169
01:23:11,541 --> 01:23:13,166
What the hell is this?

1170
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:15,666
I thought you were looking
for Project Starfish.

1171
01:23:17,625 --> 01:23:20,291
You've brought us visitors,
have you, Grieves?

1172
01:23:20,375 --> 01:23:22,666
Have you come to save me
from that madman?

1173
01:23:22,750 --> 01:23:24,750
Thirty years he's kept me here.

1174
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:26,458
Tortured me.

1175
01:23:26,541 --> 01:23:29,208
Had his way with me.

1176
01:24:08,916 --> 01:24:11,791
I call it Starro the Conqueror.

1177
01:24:11,875 --> 01:24:13,625
That's meant to be derisive.

1178
01:24:14,625 --> 01:24:15,833
Sorry, old chum.

1179
01:24:15,916 --> 01:24:17,416
These two are here to kill you.

1180
01:24:17,500 --> 01:24:18,625
It's out of my hands.

1181
01:24:18,708 --> 01:24:20,458
We need to help these people.

1182
01:24:20,541 --> 01:24:24,291
Impossible, dear. They're
corpses below those stars.

1183
01:24:25,083 --> 01:24:26,458
Who are they?

1184
01:24:27,875 --> 01:24:30,500
The fodder of powerful men
through every age.

1185
01:24:30,583 --> 01:24:31,583
Dissidents,

1186
01:24:32,541 --> 01:24:33,583
journalists,

1187
01:24:34,708 --> 01:24:36,416
political rivals,

1188
01:24:36,500 --> 01:24:38,791
and their loved ones.

1189
01:24:40,958 --> 01:24:42,500
Oh, please,

1190
01:24:42,583 --> 01:24:46,083
unclutch your fucking pearls,
Flag.

1191
01:24:46,166 --> 01:24:48,625
We serve the same master.

1192
01:24:48,708 --> 01:24:50,458
We were sent here to stop you.

1193
01:24:51,375 --> 01:24:52,500
Child,

1194
01:24:52,583 --> 01:24:54,333
your government
didn't send you here

1195
01:24:54,416 --> 01:24:57,333
to protect the world
from alien technology.

1196
01:24:57,416 --> 01:25:01,333
Your government sent you here
to cover up their part in it.

1197
01:25:01,416 --> 01:25:03,666
You're a goddamn liar.

1198
01:25:03,750 --> 01:25:07,958
American goddamn astronauts
found Starro.

1199
01:25:08,041 --> 01:25:10,708
<i>Yankee-fucking-doodle dandies.</i>

1200
01:25:10,791 --> 01:25:12,333
Although the Cold War was ended,

1201
01:25:12,416 --> 01:25:14,541
your government
saw the potential

1202
01:25:14,625 --> 01:25:16,958
in weaponizing
such a powerful beast,

1203
01:25:17,041 --> 01:25:18,500
but banish the thought

1204
01:25:18,583 --> 01:25:22,416
of any such experiments
being held on American soil.

1205
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:25,000
Your people
have always been squeamish

1206
01:25:25,083 --> 01:25:27,500
about the sacrifices necessary

1207
01:25:28,583 --> 01:25:30,083
for scientific advancement.

1208
01:25:30,166 --> 01:25:31,166
So,

1209
01:25:32,291 --> 01:25:34,083
the United States
made a secret deal

1210
01:25:34,166 --> 01:25:35,833
with the Corto Maltese
government

1211
01:25:35,916 --> 01:25:38,500
to conduct
their illegal experiments here

1212
01:25:38,583 --> 01:25:39,875
<i>in Jotunheim.</i>

1213
01:25:39,958 --> 01:25:42,125
<i>And they hired me
to oversee them.</i>

1214
01:25:42,208 --> 01:25:43,708
And now, because of

1215
01:25:43,791 --> 01:25:46,000
a run-of-the-mill
fucking military coup,

1216
01:25:46,083 --> 01:25:48,458
they're gonna destroy
30 years' worth of efforts.

1217
01:25:48,541 --> 01:25:49,708
Yeah!

1218
01:25:49,791 --> 01:25:51,708
You're the real victim here.

1219
01:25:51,791 --> 01:25:54,767
The hell you doing here? You're supposed
to be upstairs plantin' explosives.

1220
01:25:54,791 --> 01:25:57,166
I told you I didn't trust him.

1221
01:25:57,250 --> 01:25:59,250
Your records are located
in those computers?

1222
01:26:02,208 --> 01:26:05,125
Colonel, what are you doing?

1223
01:26:05,208 --> 01:26:07,791
I joined the military
to serve my country,

1224
01:26:07,875 --> 01:26:09,125
not to be its puppet.

1225
01:26:10,333 --> 01:26:12,083
What are you doing?

1226
01:26:15,333 --> 01:26:16,653
Who are you going
to show that to?

1227
01:26:16,708 --> 01:26:19,833
The press. Goddamn people
deserve to know.

1228
01:26:19,916 --> 01:26:21,809
I'm tired of coverin' up
their dirty little secrets.

1229
01:26:21,833 --> 01:26:24,193
This time these sons of bitches
are gonna be held account...

1230
01:26:25,166 --> 01:26:26,309
I can't let you do that,
Colonel.

1231
01:26:26,333 --> 01:26:28,000
- Excuse me?
- I'm truly sorry.

1232
01:26:28,083 --> 01:26:29,603
Miss Waller charged me
with makin' sure

1233
01:26:29,666 --> 01:26:31,250
those records
don't leave this building.

1234
01:26:31,333 --> 01:26:32,833
Of course, I shoulda known.

1235
01:26:32,916 --> 01:26:35,333
Waller's always got a backup.

1236
01:26:35,416 --> 01:26:37,166
Come on, man,
this isn't personal.

1237
01:26:37,250 --> 01:26:39,958
Holdin' a gun on me
is pretty fucking personal.

1238
01:26:41,333 --> 01:26:43,083
What is that?

1239
01:26:43,166 --> 01:26:44,526
I'm gonna need that drive,
Colonel.

1240
01:26:46,041 --> 01:26:48,291
Those morons set off
the explosives too early.

1241
01:26:48,375 --> 01:26:49,791
Hand over the drive!

1242
01:26:49,875 --> 01:26:52,333
Let's go, come on!

1243
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:53,625
They experimented on children.

1244
01:26:53,708 --> 01:26:55,666
No one is sayin'
what they did was right.

1245
01:26:55,750 --> 01:26:57,958
They experimented on children!

1246
01:26:58,041 --> 01:26:59,208
That information gets out,

1247
01:26:59,291 --> 01:27:01,125
it causes
an international incident!

1248
01:27:01,208 --> 01:27:03,416
Keepin' the peace
is worth any price,

1249
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:05,791
including the life
of a hero like yours, sir,

1250
01:27:05,875 --> 01:27:07,000
so please...

1251
01:27:08,708 --> 01:27:10,083
don't make me do this.

1252
01:27:49,208 --> 01:27:50,666
What have you people done?

1253
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,208
Sebastian, come!

1254
01:28:42,041 --> 01:28:44,000
Okay, we gotta calm down.

1255
01:28:44,083 --> 01:28:46,375
Let's all just...
Let's talk about this.

1256
01:28:46,458 --> 01:28:48,208
I understand
where you're coming from.

1257
01:28:48,291 --> 01:28:49,416
I crossed a line.

1258
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:50,916
Okay, I crossed a line!

1259
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,375
I realize that,
but I'm ready to change.

1260
01:28:53,458 --> 01:28:55,208
I am ready to change.

1261
01:28:55,291 --> 01:28:57,375
And I didn't mean to hurt you...

1262
01:30:47,583 --> 01:30:49,500
You motherfucker.

1263
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,250
Peacemaker.

1264
01:31:32,125 --> 01:31:33,375
What a joke.

1265
01:32:06,833 --> 01:32:07,833
Cleo.

1266
01:32:09,375 --> 01:32:11,291
Give me back the drive.

1267
01:32:32,291 --> 01:32:35,166
I told you that information
can't get out. Fuck!

1268
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:37,958
So, okay, okay,
destroy the hard drive.

1269
01:32:38,041 --> 01:32:40,750
Why kill me?

1270
01:32:46,625 --> 01:32:48,000
Because I'm thorough.

1271
01:32:50,541 --> 01:32:52,250
Oh, my...

1272
01:32:52,333 --> 01:32:53,750
Sorry, kid.

1273
01:32:53,833 --> 01:32:55,416
No, no...

1274
01:33:05,041 --> 01:33:06,458
All right, troops are coming.

1275
01:33:06,541 --> 01:33:08,583
This floor, and then
nine floors left. Let's go!

1276
01:33:08,666 --> 01:33:10,333
Come on!

1277
01:34:31,041 --> 01:34:33,083
New dumb friends.

1278
01:34:46,166 --> 01:34:47,666
Aw, fizzle sticks. Hold on.

1279
01:35:15,250 --> 01:35:17,375
Has anyone got eyes
or ears on any more?

1280
01:35:17,458 --> 01:35:18,833
They killed Milton!

1281
01:35:20,958 --> 01:35:22,458
Milton was still with us?

1282
01:35:22,541 --> 01:35:24,500
- Where'd you think he was?
- I don't know.

1283
01:35:24,583 --> 01:35:26,083
I thought he stayed back
with the bus.

1284
01:35:26,166 --> 01:35:27,291
What was Milton gonna do?

1285
01:35:27,375 --> 01:35:28,666
He was helping us!

1286
01:35:30,541 --> 01:35:31,791
- Who's Milton?
- What?

1287
01:35:31,875 --> 01:35:33,458
I don't remember any Milton.

1288
01:35:33,541 --> 01:35:36,958
Fuck! He has been with us
the whole time.

1289
01:35:37,041 --> 01:35:40,541
Somebody named Milton has
been with us the whole time?

1290
01:35:40,625 --> 01:35:41,791
Yes!

1291
01:35:41,875 --> 01:35:43,309
I don't think so.
I think I would've noticed

1292
01:35:43,333 --> 01:35:45,791
if a guy named Milton's
been with us.

1293
01:35:45,875 --> 01:35:47,291
It's not a very common name.

1294
01:35:47,375 --> 01:35:49,875
I don't think
I've ever even met Milton.

1295
01:35:49,958 --> 01:35:51,958
Are you messing around
right now?

1296
01:35:52,041 --> 01:35:53,625
He was a really nice guy,

1297
01:35:53,708 --> 01:35:56,541
and he sacrificed himself
to help us.

1298
01:35:56,625 --> 01:35:58,500
And now look at him.

1299
01:35:58,583 --> 01:35:59,708
He's dead.

1300
01:36:01,666 --> 01:36:06,375
Oh, that guy!
Milton, Milton.

1301
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:12,416
So, when did this great
love affair with Milton start?

1302
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:14,000
I liked him
from the beginning, okay?

1303
01:36:14,083 --> 01:36:15,583
I just didn't say
anything until...

1304
01:36:18,000 --> 01:36:19,416
No!

1305
01:38:14,375 --> 01:38:17,833
Harley!
Give us a hand!

1306
01:38:25,833 --> 01:38:26,833
Hey!

1307
01:38:38,375 --> 01:38:39,625
<i>Vamos. Vamos.</i>

1308
01:39:23,500 --> 01:39:24,625
Oh!

1309
01:40:14,166 --> 01:40:16,500
Oh, fuck, fuck.

1310
01:40:19,125 --> 01:40:21,458
Oh, fuck off!

1311
01:40:22,208 --> 01:40:23,250
Oh.

1312
01:40:43,083 --> 01:40:44,291
Sorry, kid.

1313
01:40:44,375 --> 01:40:45,958
No, no, no.

1314
01:41:41,083 --> 01:41:42,708
How?

1315
01:41:42,791 --> 01:41:44,333
Smaller bullets.

1316
01:41:49,250 --> 01:41:51,291
He killed Colonel Flag.

1317
01:41:52,791 --> 01:41:55,166
He wanted to share this
with the press.

1318
01:41:55,250 --> 01:41:56,708
It's proof
the American government

1319
01:41:56,791 --> 01:41:59,750
was behind Project Starfish
the whole time.

1320
01:42:34,625 --> 01:42:36,416
Whoa. Whoa.

1321
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,583
I think it's trying to get out.

1322
01:42:52,666 --> 01:42:54,458
- What?
- Starro the...

1323
01:43:17,666 --> 01:43:18,666
Whoa.

1324
01:44:27,666 --> 01:44:29,750

1328
01:45:55,583 --> 01:45:57,166
Uh... Hey, guys?

1329
01:45:59,666 --> 01:46:01,458
Oh, shit, there's...

1330
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:22,458
This city is mine.

1331
01:46:52,583 --> 01:46:55,333
Uh, Miss Waller,
I think the feed is back up.

1332
01:46:58,166 --> 01:46:59,791
Oh, my God, Miss Waller!

1333
01:46:59,875 --> 01:47:02,791

1336
01:47:17,875 --> 01:47:19,291
Uh-huh.

1337

01:47:22,250 --> 01:47:24,250
must have been in the building
you just demolished.

1340
01:47:24,333 --> 01:47:27,083
Yeah, well, we've got a mite
issue over here, Waller.

1341
01:47:27,166 --> 01:47:29,333
It's Project Starfish,
Miss Waller.

1342
01:47:29,416 --> 01:47:31,500
It's headed towards the city,
and I think it wants

1343
01:47:31,583 --> 01:47:33,666
to feed on as many people
as it can.

1344
01:47:38,041 --> 01:47:39,625
<i>Not our problem.</i>

1345

<i>Corto Maltese

1348
01:47:45,958 --> 01:47:47,598

fomenting disruption
in a hostile nation

1350
01:47:49,916 --> 01:47:50,958
a positive development.

1351
01:48:24,500 --> 01:48:25,958
You heard what she said.

1352
01:48:47,166 --> 01:48:48,833
Fuck.

1353
01:48:53,875 --> 01:48:55,750

1355
01:48:57,958 --> 01:48:59,750
She'll kill you, you know.

1356
01:48:59,833 --> 01:49:01,583
That's her business.

1357
01:49:01,666 --> 01:49:04,416
I knew Sebastian sensed good
in you for a reason.

1358

Just keep that fucking rat
away from me.

Little kids.

1379
01:50:20,333 --> 01:50:24,958
Task Force X, the creature
is headed to Calle Principal.

1380
01:50:25,041 --> 01:50:26,375
Avoid Avenida Medrano.

- Jesus.

is Calle Aguero.

No. That nom nom though.

Said they found him
in the rubble.

1522
02:10:56,375 --> 02:10:58,375
They were shocked
his heart was still beating.

1523
02:10:58,458 --> 02:10:59,833
I wasn't certain
how safe it was,

1524
02:10:59,916 --> 02:11:01,208
shipping him back here.

1525
02:11:01,291 --> 02:11:04,416
But, if anything,
he's shown he's resilient.

1526
02:11:04,500 --> 02:11:05,750
It'll take some surgery,

1527
02:11:05,833 --> 02:11:07,633
but eventually we'll get him
back up to speed.

1528
02:11:09,833 --> 02:11:11,750
You realize
this is revenge, right?

1529
02:11:11,833 --> 02:11:13,583
Waller knows
we double-crossed her,

1530
02:11:13,666 --> 02:11:14,875
and she's getting back at us

1531
02:11:14,958 --> 02:11:16,958
by saddling us
with this douche bag.

1532
02:11:17,041 --> 02:11:18,416
Yep.

1533
02:11:18,500 --> 02:11:20,666
I heard he was sort of a hero
down in Corto Maltese.

1534
02:11:20,750 --> 02:11:23,125
Oh, is that what you heard?
Because not quite.

1535
02:11:25,041 --> 02:11:27,625
What do you guys want him for?

1536
02:11:27,708 --> 02:11:30,500
Just to save
the fucking world, that's all.
