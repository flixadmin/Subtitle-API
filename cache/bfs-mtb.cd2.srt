1
00:00:30,686 --> 00:00:33,780
Why are you back so early?

2
00:00:33,922 --> 00:00:37,085
Aren't you supposed
to be recording a show?

3
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,128
Change of plans.

4
00:00:40,362 --> 00:00:43,229
Me, too.

5
00:00:49,071 --> 00:00:50,698
Drink this.

6
00:00:57,446 --> 00:00:59,038
Didn't you eat?

7
00:00:59,348 --> 00:01:03,444
I did, but I'm still starving.

8
00:01:09,324 --> 00:01:12,657
Why are you eating
noodles instead of rice?

9
00:01:12,928 --> 00:01:16,887
Just wanted something simple.

10
00:01:18,133 --> 00:01:19,430
It's good, huh?

11
00:01:22,638 --> 00:01:25,835
If you could stop time,
what would you do first?

12
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:32,903
If everyone else is frozen
and only you can move?

13
00:01:34,082 --> 00:01:37,381
If time stopped, you wouldn't die.

14
00:01:40,422 --> 00:01:42,219
Don't you want to live?

15
00:01:46,595 --> 00:01:48,358
Not talking to me?

16
00:01:50,899 --> 00:01:54,926
Too sorry to die and leave
the girl you love alone.

17
00:01:57,139 --> 00:01:59,937
Okay, I can understand that much.

18
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,137
But still...

19
00:02:04,946 --> 00:02:08,507
How can you marry her
off to someone else?

20
00:02:09,718 --> 00:02:12,812
Isn't that going overboard?

21
00:02:16,391 --> 00:02:18,791
You're not dead, yet.

22
00:02:20,962 --> 00:02:23,988
- How can you watch that?
- Ah, Jenna?

23
00:02:25,167 --> 00:02:27,897
Let's just stick to ourjobs.

24
00:02:28,303 --> 00:02:31,636
What's love?

25
00:02:39,014 --> 00:02:40,948
Like brushing your teeth.

26
00:02:41,249 --> 00:02:43,114
Brushing your teeth?

27
00:02:44,453 --> 00:02:46,555
But you do that alone.

28
00:02:46,555 --> 00:02:48,853
Do you brush to show someone?

29
00:02:52,494 --> 00:02:55,054
Why didn't you come yesterday?

30
00:02:59,868 --> 00:03:00,857
Pardon?

31
00:03:10,846 --> 00:03:13,337
I said, did you wait for me?

32
00:03:13,648 --> 00:03:20,679
Well, just wondering
why you didn't come.

33
00:03:20,789 --> 00:03:23,883
You fell in love with me, didn't you?

34
00:03:24,226 --> 00:03:25,352
What?

35
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,263
Love makes you wonder
and wait for that person.

36
00:03:31,566 --> 00:03:35,771
It's not that. If a patient
doesn't come, I wait.

37
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:38,365
Do you wonder about every patient?

38
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,564
Well...

39
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:45,712
You're blushing. It's love all right.

40
00:03:47,716 --> 00:03:49,183
Hey, KANG Chul-kyu!

41
00:03:49,284 --> 00:03:50,842
Yes, boss.

42
00:03:51,052 --> 00:03:53,987
How much did you get from KIM Gap-sik?

43
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:58,059
Should've been more discreet!

44
00:03:58,059 --> 00:04:00,619
Cat Girl's on your show 10 times a week!

45
00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:03,698
Think people will stay still?

46
00:04:04,132 --> 00:04:09,900
Someone wrote in to audit your show!

47
00:04:10,071 --> 00:04:13,666
What's got into you all of a sudden?

48
00:04:13,775 --> 00:04:17,768
You of all people!

49
00:04:22,117 --> 00:04:24,210
When are you going to break it off?

50
00:04:25,253 --> 00:04:26,777
In a rush?

51
00:04:27,823 --> 00:04:29,814
You saw my medical records.

52
00:04:32,461 --> 00:04:34,827
I want to keep playing.

53
00:04:36,364 --> 00:04:40,858
But I guess you don't have that luxury.

54
00:04:46,007 --> 00:04:48,032
Under one condition.

55
00:04:54,649 --> 00:04:56,583
Now, what.

56
00:04:57,419 --> 00:04:59,683
I'll tell you after I break it off.

57
00:05:00,188 --> 00:05:02,383
A promise is a promise.

58
00:05:17,506 --> 00:05:21,101
Since when was it no smoking in here.

59
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:26,076
No idea.

60
00:05:35,123 --> 00:05:39,150
Our parents will be shocked.

61
00:05:49,704 --> 00:05:56,144
I should be really angry
at a time like this, right?

62
00:05:56,144 --> 00:06:00,478
Yell at you or something?

63
00:06:03,351 --> 00:06:11,554
Funny, somehow I feel a little grateful.

64
00:06:13,795 --> 00:06:15,888
I'm going out for a smoke.

65
00:06:19,267 --> 00:06:20,632
So uncomfortable.

66
00:06:24,673 --> 00:06:26,436
My engagement's off.

67
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,450
I don't have parents.

68
00:06:40,388 --> 00:06:43,915
I was studying late at high
school in my senior year.

69
00:06:45,126 --> 00:06:48,527
My homeroom teacher came
in and stared right at me.

70
00:06:48,797 --> 00:06:57,501
Like someone who came
to take me on death row.

71
00:06:58,974 --> 00:07:01,568
Like in the movies, you know?

72
00:07:02,944 --> 00:07:06,710
Anyway, he told me

73
00:07:06,982 --> 00:07:11,316
to go to the hospital right away.

74
00:07:11,653 --> 00:07:14,622
When I asked why...

75
00:07:14,856 --> 00:07:17,926
if he said my parents and

76
00:07:17,926 --> 00:07:21,362
sister died in a car accident...

77
00:07:21,896 --> 00:07:27,163
then I wouldn't have gone
and seen them like that.

78
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:32,403
I see...

79
00:07:32,907 --> 00:07:35,637
K's been with me ever since.

80
00:07:36,611 --> 00:07:38,078
K?

81
00:07:40,315 --> 00:07:44,411
You saw him, Producer KANG Chul-kyu?

82
00:07:45,253 --> 00:07:49,087
His name sounds too corny
so I just call him K.

83
00:07:52,861 --> 00:07:57,093
At home, he's my Mom
At work, he's my Dad.

84
00:07:57,332 --> 00:07:59,527
When I'm sad, he's my brother.

85
00:08:00,301 --> 00:08:04,260
Sometimes he's like a lover.
Though he always chickens out.

86
00:08:05,874 --> 00:08:09,037
Can I kiss you?

87
00:08:10,745 --> 00:08:13,236
You wanna kiss me?

88
00:08:21,856 --> 00:08:23,221
Stupid.

89
00:08:24,526 --> 00:08:26,926
Let me see.

90
00:08:29,397 --> 00:08:30,455
Oh, no.

91
00:08:30,565 --> 00:08:32,590
That's right, I'm stupid!

92
00:08:41,476 --> 00:08:44,502
Open the door. Are you okay?

93
00:08:55,457 --> 00:08:57,687
<i>Don't look!</i> <i>Stupid!</i>

94
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:11,964
<i>Stupid! Stupid!</i> <i>Stupid!</i>

95
00:09:39,934 --> 00:09:42,437
<i>I was born to love you.</i>

96
00:09:42,437 --> 00:09:46,498
<i>Heaven sent me to love you.</i>

97
00:09:48,443 --> 00:09:50,845
<i>Cat Girl's</i> <i>'lf
I could live again'</i>

98
00:09:50,845 --> 00:09:53,006
<i>requested by</i>
<i>ID: Little Mermaid.</i>

99
00:09:53,181 --> 00:09:55,183
- You wrote this song, Cream?
- Yes.

100
00:09:55,183 --> 00:09:57,743
Let's hear, 'lf I could live again'.

101
00:10:07,028 --> 00:10:08,620
(Did you eat?)

102
00:10:10,732 --> 00:10:12,723
(I'm almost done!)

103
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,819
Yes, boss.

104
00:10:30,819 --> 00:10:34,589
<i>Come to my office, now.</i>

105
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:35,886
Okay.

106
00:10:43,898 --> 00:10:47,265
Producer KANG!

107
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,096
KANG!

108
00:10:50,405 --> 00:10:55,944
I heard everything. I'm going to
speak with the boss, right now!

109
00:10:55,944 --> 00:11:00,938
How can he fire a genius like you!

110
00:11:01,115 --> 00:11:03,017
I'm not getting fired.

111
00:11:03,017 --> 00:11:05,820
Same difference.

112
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,516
- You can't go like this!
- I'm taking a break.

113
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:14,229
Really? That's not what I heard.

114
00:11:14,229 --> 00:11:17,858
I'm going to the States
to study for a while.

115
00:11:17,966 --> 00:11:25,134
Really? Guess there's
no use going to the boss.

116
00:11:25,907 --> 00:11:29,811
Thank you for everything, Mr. KIM.

117
00:11:29,811 --> 00:11:33,247
- Anytime. - You
too, Min-chul.

118
00:11:33,481 --> 00:11:36,746
Give him the demo tape, Min-chul.

119
00:11:37,986 --> 00:11:41,888
Producer CHOI! Hold on! Wait!

120
00:11:49,898 --> 00:11:51,525
Min-chul...

121
00:12:17,592 --> 00:12:18,854
It's a ballad.

122
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,793
Write up a good song.

123
00:12:29,504 --> 00:12:31,199
What's marriage?

124
00:12:33,508 --> 00:12:34,998
Marriage?

125
00:12:35,443 --> 00:12:36,808
Marriage.

126
00:12:41,215 --> 00:12:43,809
- Marriage...
- Wait!

127
00:12:56,264 --> 00:12:58,323
A toothbrush holder.

128
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,163
What?

129
00:13:01,936 --> 00:13:06,373
There's only one holder,
but many toothbrushes.

130
00:13:08,343 --> 00:13:10,743
What's that got to do with marriage?

131
00:13:11,012 --> 00:13:17,975
Being together as one like
toothbrushes in a holder.

132
00:13:21,556 --> 00:13:24,024
Then I must be married, already.

133
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,852
Stupid! You can't be
married without a wedding.

134
00:13:31,566 --> 00:13:33,033
Really?

135
00:13:35,336 --> 00:13:36,826
I gotta pee.

136
00:14:06,034 --> 00:14:07,934
<i>No one else but Thee.</i>

137
00:14:14,442 --> 00:14:16,569
'Thee' is a lucky person.

138
00:14:20,314 --> 00:14:22,214
Wanna hear it?

139
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:01,913
EUN Won and I living
together probably got to you.

140
00:15:02,824 --> 00:15:04,525
But there's nothing to worry about.

141
00:15:04,525 --> 00:15:06,186
I'm okay with that.

142
00:15:06,861 --> 00:15:12,629
I'm thankful for
everything you did for her.

143
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:16,495
Let's get together often.

144
00:15:16,804 --> 00:15:19,136
Go on trips together and stuff.

145
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,274
Sounds good.

146
00:15:23,111 --> 00:15:27,912
She says she wants to pick
out her wedding dress with you.

147
00:15:28,182 --> 00:15:29,911
Gotta love her wild ideas.

148
00:15:30,017 --> 00:15:32,042
Why me?

149
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,051
I want what she wants.

150
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,520
Please do it for her.

151
00:15:43,664 --> 00:15:52,402
And I hope it's the last
thing you ever do for her.

152
00:15:54,575 --> 00:15:58,238
Sure. Please take good care of her.

153
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:02,475
Of course. She's my woman, now.

154
00:16:02,783 --> 00:16:04,148
Let's drink.

155
00:16:19,834 --> 00:16:21,392
What do you think?

156
00:16:27,542 --> 00:16:29,032
Very pretty.

157
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:36,812
It's time for the groom-to-be
to try on his suit.

158
00:16:38,686 --> 00:16:40,121
I'm not the groom.

159
00:16:40,121 --> 00:16:41,713
Try it on.

160
00:16:50,398 --> 00:16:51,660
Come up here.

161
00:16:54,936 --> 00:16:58,929
Come here. Can you take a picture of us?

162
00:16:59,073 --> 00:17:02,600
On three. One, two, three!

163
00:17:11,352 --> 00:17:14,185
Wait out there. I'll
try on something else.

164
00:19:49,944 --> 00:19:52,469
Why are all the clocks stopped?

165
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,177
No reason.

166
00:19:57,685 --> 00:20:00,051
Can I turn one on?

167
00:20:04,158 --> 00:20:05,591
Why?

168
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,657
No reason.

169
00:20:09,597 --> 00:20:11,155
No reason?

170
00:20:12,466 --> 00:20:13,728
Sure.

171
00:20:39,727 --> 00:20:44,391
Jenna? I have a big favor to ask.

172
00:20:45,466 --> 00:20:46,933
What is it?

173
00:20:48,869 --> 00:20:54,739
I need to send flowers on her
anniversary for a few years.

174
00:20:57,878 --> 00:21:01,814
She'll get suspicious, if
I lose touch altogether.

175
00:21:05,453 --> 00:21:08,217
I had one more condition. Remember?

176
00:21:11,225 --> 00:21:13,022
What is it?

177
00:21:35,916 --> 00:21:38,043
Please die at my side.

178
00:21:45,493 --> 00:21:48,758
You booked the tickets?

179
00:21:51,932 --> 00:21:54,594
I'm running low on battery.

180
00:21:56,237 --> 00:21:57,431
Hey.

181
00:21:59,874 --> 00:22:01,171
What are you making?

182
00:22:05,946 --> 00:22:08,938
My phone battery ran out.

183
00:22:09,617 --> 00:22:15,886
I'll charge it and call you back later.

184
00:22:16,056 --> 00:22:17,458
Bye.

185
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:18,755
Hi.

186
00:22:23,264 --> 00:22:26,893
Why'd you leave me there like that?

187
00:22:28,035 --> 00:22:29,502
It's for you.

188
00:22:40,147 --> 00:22:41,910
Who do you think you are!

189
00:22:42,516 --> 00:22:44,245
What's with you?

190
00:22:44,418 --> 00:22:47,251
Who says you can touch my phone!

191
00:22:49,523 --> 00:22:51,354
The hell you...

192
00:22:54,628 --> 00:22:57,222
Who says you can do
whatever you want with me!

193
00:23:30,965 --> 00:23:32,262
Can I help you?

194
00:23:32,366 --> 00:23:33,993
Is K home?

195
00:23:35,569 --> 00:23:37,196
K?

196
00:24:00,828 --> 00:24:02,591
Someone's here.

197
00:24:21,415 --> 00:24:25,909
She's pretty. I can
see why you love her.

198
00:24:27,321 --> 00:24:32,315
You think she's happy?

199
00:24:33,394 --> 00:24:35,294
What are you saying?

200
00:24:36,063 --> 00:24:38,122
She didn't seem happy.

201
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,567
Can you send this for the next 3 years?

202
00:24:45,406 --> 00:24:46,839
It's pretty.

203
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:50,073
Maybe too pretty.

204
00:24:53,347 --> 00:24:56,475
It looks fake. Like your love.

205
00:24:57,551 --> 00:24:59,485
Then what's real?

206
00:25:03,557 --> 00:25:04,990
Real?

207
00:25:07,461 --> 00:25:11,454
If you're hungry, you eat.
If you're hurting, you cry.

208
00:25:11,832 --> 00:25:16,826
If you're having fun, you
laugh. Not hold it in like you.

209
00:25:18,272 --> 00:25:20,900
You really wanna die like this?

210
00:25:23,644 --> 00:25:25,134
No!

211
00:25:27,347 --> 00:25:29,212
I don't want to die like this.

212
00:25:30,617 --> 00:25:32,812
I want to live a happy life.

213
00:25:35,456 --> 00:25:37,720
I want to be the one marrying EUN Won...

214
00:25:38,859 --> 00:25:40,884
...instead of him, tomorrow.

215
00:25:45,232 --> 00:25:46,699
But...

216
00:25:47,968 --> 00:25:49,629
That's just a dream.

217
00:25:50,304 --> 00:25:51,999
A sad dream.

218
00:25:55,409 --> 00:25:58,572
I'm done with dreaming.

219
00:26:53,901 --> 00:26:56,461
<i>Sleep tight and sweet dreams.</i>

220
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:19,850
<i>Did you eat?</i> <i>
- Cream</i>

221
00:27:23,931 --> 00:27:25,262
Thanks.

222
00:27:44,484 --> 00:27:46,543
<i>I'm not talking to you.</i>

223
00:27:54,995 --> 00:27:56,519
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

224
00:28:03,570 --> 00:28:05,003
<i>For what?</i>

225
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:09,433
<i>For everything.</i>

226
00:28:16,149 --> 00:28:17,980
<i>I'm sorry, too.</i>

227
00:28:18,719 --> 00:28:20,016
<i>For what?</i>

228
00:28:21,121 --> 00:28:22,418
<i>For everything.</i>

229
00:28:25,726 --> 00:28:28,786
<i>I love you...</i>

230
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,333
<i>I like you.</i>

231
00:28:35,669 --> 00:28:37,000
<i>Me, too.</i>

232
00:30:58,545 --> 00:31:00,410
That's some story.

233
00:31:02,682 --> 00:31:06,015
KANG... amazing guy. I had no idea.

234
00:31:07,654 --> 00:31:14,082
Is there anyway to reach
them? What about the dentist?

235
00:31:20,467 --> 00:31:23,766
Wonder what happened to her.

236
00:31:31,044 --> 00:31:34,343
Let's record it.

237
00:31:36,183 --> 00:31:38,879
Really? I'll call right now.

238
00:31:39,052 --> 00:31:42,249
No, the other song.

239
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:46,115
Oh, that song.

240
00:33:11,578 --> 00:33:13,346
I gotta go, I'm late.

241
00:33:13,346 --> 00:33:16,713
Get up and eat. I made breakfast.

242
00:34:14,307 --> 00:34:15,672
<i>What's this?</i>

243
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:21,279
<i>Ah, Vitamin ABC.</i> <i>It
helps me get smarter.</i>

244
00:35:08,361 --> 00:35:11,489
Where'd you get these pills?

245
00:35:11,965 --> 00:35:14,160
They're my friends' pills.

246
00:35:14,868 --> 00:35:19,328
Since when did your
friend start taking this?

247
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,764
Why?

248
00:35:22,442 --> 00:35:26,742
The pain must've been
severe to take these pills.

249
00:35:28,214 --> 00:35:29,306
What?

250
00:35:29,849 --> 00:35:35,378
They're painkillers for
patients with cancer or leukemia.

251
00:35:35,689 --> 00:35:37,748
<i>Terminal patients.</i>

252
00:35:39,059 --> 00:35:42,790
<i>Have you heard of</i>
<i>the hospice ward?</i>

253
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:47,530
<i>It's where dying patients stay...</i>

254
00:35:47,967 --> 00:35:52,028
<i>with consent from their families.</i>

255
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,282
Mom!

256
00:36:08,421 --> 00:36:11,024
Watch the house while we're out.

257
00:36:11,024 --> 00:36:13,424
See you later, sis!

258
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:21,032
No!

259
00:36:45,759 --> 00:36:48,819
<i>When I found out</i> <i>what
Vitamin ABC really was...</i>

260
00:36:49,062 --> 00:36:52,930
<i>When I finally realized</i>
<i>what they were...</i>

261
00:36:53,166 --> 00:36:57,728
<i>When my whole world</i>
<i>turned pitch dark before me...</i>

262
00:36:58,171 --> 00:36:59,638
What's wrong?

263
00:36:59,873 --> 00:37:02,569
<i>I died before K.</i>

264
00:37:05,478 --> 00:37:13,214
<i>I met K a year after</i> <i>my
whole family passed away.</i>

265
00:37:14,954 --> 00:37:18,947
<i>Though almost 3 hours passed...</i>

266
00:37:20,293 --> 00:37:23,387
<i>he stood there frozen like stone.</i>

267
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:27,233
<i>Crying and looking in the
direction</i> <i>his mother went.</i>

268
00:37:27,233 --> 00:37:32,034
<i>This will be enough to support you</i>
<i>till you're an adult, Chul-kyu.</i>

269
00:37:33,106 --> 00:37:39,204
<i>He looked sadder</i>
<i>and more hurt than me.</i>

270
00:37:40,647 --> 00:37:43,445
<i>He needed a hug</i>
<i>more than me.</i>

271
00:37:44,451 --> 00:37:46,715
Is there anything you want to tell me?

272
00:37:47,487 --> 00:37:49,011
Like what?

273
00:37:52,192 --> 00:37:55,889
A deep, dark secret?

274
00:37:58,565 --> 00:38:02,126
Say anything. I'm ready to listen.

275
00:38:03,736 --> 00:38:05,169
I like you.

276
00:38:05,472 --> 00:38:08,100
<i>Stupid idiot.</i>

277
00:38:08,708 --> 00:38:10,505
Do you have a wish?

278
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:12,178
What's with you?

279
00:38:12,178 --> 00:38:15,306
Just curious all of a sudden.

280
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:20,816
If you could do anything
you want in the world.

281
00:38:21,421 --> 00:38:23,412
<i>K is dying.</i>

282
00:38:23,756 --> 00:38:26,224
Meet a great guy and get married.

283
00:38:26,392 --> 00:38:28,261
Can't I marry you?

284
00:38:28,261 --> 00:38:30,456
I'm not a great guy.

285
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,932
Then who is?

286
00:38:32,932 --> 00:38:36,834
Someone who is healthy and nice.

287
00:38:37,403 --> 00:38:39,894
Who knows how to take
care of his family.

288
00:38:41,107 --> 00:38:44,304
<i>I already met a great guy.</i>

289
00:38:45,144 --> 00:38:48,807
<i>But K told me</i> <i>to
meet someone else.</i>

290
00:38:49,282 --> 00:38:52,774
<i>He said that was his wish.</i>

291
00:38:54,354 --> 00:38:58,290
<i>KANG Chul-kyu</i>

292
00:39:01,961 --> 00:39:05,055
<i>When I heard K fainted...</i>

293
00:39:05,565 --> 00:39:09,331
<i>I rushed over,</i>
<i>afraid I'll go crazy.</i>

294
00:39:11,004 --> 00:39:12,801
<i>But I...</i>

295
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,341
<i>... couldn't even go crazy.</i>

296
00:39:15,341 --> 00:39:17,343
No, doc.

297
00:39:17,343 --> 00:39:20,005
But she should know.

298
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:23,471
What are you going to do?

299
00:39:24,183 --> 00:39:26,242
I don't know.

300
00:39:30,657 --> 00:39:33,558
It feels like a needle
stuck in my throat.

301
00:39:36,896 --> 00:39:38,625
Right here.

302
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,527
It gets stuck right here.

303
00:39:44,003 --> 00:39:46,631
I can't say it.

304
00:39:48,341 --> 00:39:55,144
She'll live on. Think of yourself.

305
00:39:55,949 --> 00:39:58,349
She's different.

306
00:39:59,686 --> 00:40:01,779
She needs someone beside her.

307
00:40:17,103 --> 00:40:19,594
- Hello.
- There goes Mr. Perfect.

308
00:40:20,907 --> 00:40:23,307
Glowing from head to toe!

309
00:40:28,147 --> 00:40:30,411
<i>I picked a man.</i>

310
00:40:40,193 --> 00:40:42,354
Which side did you drink from?

311
00:40:45,465 --> 00:40:46,699
Pardon?

312
00:40:46,699 --> 00:40:49,099
I'm engaged.

313
00:40:49,636 --> 00:40:57,008
<i>Stupid. You think I care</i>
<i>whether you're engaged or not?</i>

314
00:40:58,311 --> 00:41:01,906
<i>Just play along and
meet me.</i> <i>For K.</i>

315
00:41:02,982 --> 00:41:05,007
<i>Am I a bitch?</i>

316
00:41:05,718 --> 00:41:08,221
<i>I don't have time</i>
<i>to worry about that!</i>

317
00:41:08,221 --> 00:41:10,587
<i>The man I love is dying!</i>

318
00:41:21,467 --> 00:41:27,269
<i>If I could be born again...</i>
<i>A ring? A pair of glasses?</i>

319
00:41:28,975 --> 00:41:33,071
<i>A bed? A diary?</i>

320
00:41:33,546 --> 00:41:37,243
<i>Born again as things like
that?</i> <i>What fun is that?</i>

321
00:41:37,517 --> 00:41:42,147
<i>You can buy me.</i> <i>It'll
always be fun at your side.</i>

322
00:41:58,171 --> 00:42:01,971
What's wrong? Are you okay?

323
00:42:04,077 --> 00:42:05,339
Let me see your hand.

324
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:14,209
Where are you going?

325
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,908
<i>I made a deal with myself.</i>

326
00:42:36,642 --> 00:42:39,110
<i>If he turns around,</i>
<i>I'd tell him everything.</i>

327
00:42:40,646 --> 00:42:45,015
<i>If he turns around,</i> <i>I'd
hug him and stop everything.</i>

328
00:42:46,753 --> 00:42:49,745
<i>But K didn't look back.</i>

329
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:54,548
<i>And there was nothing</i>
<i>I could do.</i>

330
00:43:00,233 --> 00:43:02,701
Why are you eating
noodles instead of rice?

331
00:43:03,669 --> 00:43:05,864
Just wanted something simple.

332
00:43:09,375 --> 00:43:11,969
- It's good, huh?
- Yeah.

333
00:43:16,048 --> 00:43:19,142
<i>As I sat eating the
noodles</i> <i>with him...</i>

334
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:22,722
<i>I'd think,</i> <i>'Don't
die you bastard'</i>

335
00:43:22,722 --> 00:43:25,589
<i>and drank some water instead.</i>

336
00:43:26,092 --> 00:43:30,859
<i>'Tell me. Let me hold you!</i>
<i>I'll die with you! '</i>

337
00:43:31,197 --> 00:43:35,657
<i>'I'll follow you and pay you back</i>
<i>for everything you did for me! '</i>

338
00:43:36,469 --> 00:43:39,666
<i>Instead, I just drank the water.</i>

339
00:43:40,706 --> 00:43:43,334
<i>And finished the noodles.</i>

340
00:43:47,513 --> 00:43:53,145
There's only one holder,
but many toothbrushes.

341
00:43:54,754 --> 00:43:57,552
What's that got to do with marriage?

342
00:43:58,424 --> 00:44:04,988
Being together as one like
toothbrushes in a holder.

343
00:44:08,768 --> 00:44:11,066
Then I must be married, already.

344
00:44:12,538 --> 00:44:16,406
Stupid! You can't be
married without a wedding.

345
00:44:18,411 --> 00:44:19,901
Really?

346
00:44:50,109 --> 00:44:52,509
Can we get married, soon?

347
00:45:17,937 --> 00:45:20,667
Wait out there. I'll
try on something else.

348
00:45:57,143 --> 00:45:59,236
The hell you...

349
00:46:02,248 --> 00:46:05,046
Who says you can do
whatever you want with me!

350
00:46:15,394 --> 00:46:16,986
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

351
00:46:23,636 --> 00:46:26,662
<i>I want to tell him I love him.</i>

352
00:46:27,073 --> 00:46:31,442
<i>I want to open my mouth</i>
<i>and say I love him.</i>

353
00:46:32,912 --> 00:46:36,780
<i>But I knew tears will fall</i>
<i>before I could say it.</i>

354
00:46:37,116 --> 00:46:40,517
<i>So I kept silent, again.</i>

355
00:46:53,899 --> 00:46:56,094
When are you going to talk to me?

356
00:46:57,603 --> 00:47:02,097
Didn't you hear me screaming
at you all this time?

357
00:47:02,708 --> 00:47:04,141
What?

358
00:47:05,644 --> 00:47:07,305
Stupid.

359
00:47:08,047 --> 00:47:09,981
I didn't hear anything.

360
00:47:11,017 --> 00:47:13,315
Then how can mutes love?

361
00:47:25,564 --> 00:47:27,361
I love you.

362
00:47:32,304 --> 00:47:33,771
Me, too.

363
00:47:58,497 --> 00:48:01,091
<i>We became a real couple.</i>

364
00:48:01,333 --> 00:48:03,460
<i>Cuz we made it down the aisle.</i>

365
00:49:35,728 --> 00:49:37,923
<i>Heaven's Gate Resting Place</i>

366
00:49:56,882 --> 00:49:58,008
Wait!

367
00:49:58,083 --> 00:49:59,448
You never learn!

368
00:50:00,553 --> 00:50:02,418
How can you write
with a brain like that?

369
00:50:11,664 --> 00:50:14,064
This isn't kissing, is it?

370
00:50:26,245 --> 00:50:27,803
Can you take a picture of us?

371
00:50:28,047 --> 00:50:30,481
On three. One, two, three!

372
00:50:32,384 --> 00:50:40,450
<i>I was born to love you.</i>
<i>Heaven send me to love you.</i>

373
00:51:39,852 --> 00:51:42,821
<i>- EUN
Won -</i>

374
00:51:42,988 --> 00:51:44,556
<i>I'm making noodles.</i>
<i>Want some?</i>

375
00:51:44,556 --> 00:51:46,625
<i>No, I gotta work.</i>

376
00:51:46,625 --> 00:51:47,993
<i>You sure?</i>

377
00:51:47,993 --> 00:51:49,756
<i>Yes, I'm working!</i>

378
00:51:49,862 --> 00:51:53,855
<i>- Then I'm just making
one!</i> <i>- Okay.</i>

379
00:51:54,733 --> 00:51:56,564
<i>Don't come beggin'later.</i>

380
00:51:56,702 --> 00:51:58,704
<i>- Hey!</i>
<i>- What?</i>

381
00:51:58,704 --> 00:52:01,867
<i>No eggs! Give me that.</i>

382
00:52:04,310 --> 00:52:06,835
<i>Wonder who invented noodles.</i>

383
00:52:07,046 --> 00:52:09,548
<i>You said you didn't want any.</i>

384
00:52:09,548 --> 00:52:11,140
<i>Changed my mind.</i>

385
00:52:12,051 --> 00:52:13,575
<i>Is there any rice?</i>

386
00:52:15,387 --> 00:52:18,618
<i>Hold on.</i> <i>There's
some in the fridge.</i>

387
00:52:19,825 --> 00:52:24,888
<i>Chul-kyu...</i>
<i>I'm coming to you.</i>

388
00:52:26,231 --> 00:52:28,699
<i>Don't worry.</i>

389
00:52:29,802 --> 00:52:34,136
<i>I trust you.</i> <i>You
were always my compass.</i>

390
00:52:35,874 --> 00:52:40,979
<i>Remember when I said</i>
<i>I can see you</i>

391
00:52:40,979 --> 00:52:44,176
<i>even when you're not with me?</i>

392
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:48,283
<i>Go wherever you want.</i>

393
00:52:49,254 --> 00:52:52,087
<i>I'll find you, soon.</i>

394
00:52:53,992 --> 00:52:57,860
<i>Don't get mad when you see me.</i>

395
00:52:59,331 --> 00:53:06,931
<i>Don't ask me why I followed
you</i> <i>or get angry at me.</i>

396
00:53:08,307 --> 00:53:15,338
<i>After everything to come to
you,</i> <i>if you get mad I'll cry.</i>

397
00:53:16,682 --> 00:53:21,710
<i>When we meet again on the other
side,</i> <i>let's not cry again.</i>

398
00:53:21,887 --> 00:53:24,879
<i>Wait for me.</i>
<i>I'll be right there.</i>
