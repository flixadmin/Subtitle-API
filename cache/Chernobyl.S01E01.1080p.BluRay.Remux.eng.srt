VALERY: (OVER TAPE)
What is the cost of lies?

7
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,588
It's not that we'll mistake them
for the truth.

8
00:00:46,464 --> 00:00:49,300
The real danger is that
if we hear enough lies,

9
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:53,012
then we no longer recognize
the truth at all.

10
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:56,015
What can we do then?

11
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:59,602
What else is left but to abandon
even the hope of truth

12
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:03,397
and content ourselves instead
with stories?

13
00:01:04,357 --> 00:01:07,401
In these stories,
it doesn't matter who the heroes are.

All we want to know is,
who is to blame?

15
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:15,785
In this story, it was Anatoly Dyatlov.
He was the best choice.

16
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:19,580
An arrogant, unpleasant man,
he ran the room that night.

17
00:01:19,664 --> 00:01:20,957
He gave the orders.

18
00:01:21,624 --> 00:01:22,708
And no friends.

19
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:26,504
Or, at least, not important ones.

20
00:01:28,923 --> 00:01:33,594
And now, Dyatlov will spend the next
10 years in a prison labor camp.

21
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:37,473
Of course, that sentence
is doubly unfair.

22
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:42,436
There were far greater criminals
than him at work.

25
00:01:47,984 --> 00:01:49,902
The man doesn't deserve prison.

26
00:01:51,696 --> 00:01:53,030
He deserves death.

323
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:12,441
or, God forbid, Frolyshev,
that my power plant is on fire.

324

No one can blame you for this,
Director Bryukhanov.

325
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,445
Of course no one can
blame me for this.

326
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:19,657
How can I be responsible?
I was sleeping.

Tell me what happened, quickly.

328

We ran the test exactly as
Chief Engineer Fomin approved.

329
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:31,002
Unit Shift Chief Akimov
and Engineer Toptunov

330
00:28:31,294 --> 00:28:32,920
encountered technical difficulties,

331
00:28:33,004 --> 00:28:36,257
leading to an accumulation of hydrogen
in the control system tank.

332
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:38,634
It regrettably ignited,

333
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:40,845
damaging the plant,
setting the roof on fire.

334
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:44,765
The tank is quite large.

335
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:47,143
It's the only logical explanation.

336
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:51,022
Of course,
Deputy Chief Engineer Dyatlov

337
00:28:51,105 --> 00:28:55,026
was directly supervising the test,
so he would know best.

- Reactor?
- We're taking measures to ensure

340

a steady flow of water
through the core.

341
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:07,413
- What about radiation?
- Obviously, down here it's nothing,

342
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:11,584
but in the reactor building,
I'm being told, 3.6 roentgen per hour.

343
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:14,211
Well, that's not great,
but it's not horrifying.

344
00:29:14,295 --> 00:29:15,296
FOMIN: Not at all.
