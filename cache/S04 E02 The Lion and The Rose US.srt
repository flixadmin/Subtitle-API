1
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:53,822
Tansy!

2
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:57,075
Tansy! Tansy!

3
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,494
Tansy!

4
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,291
Oh, my God.

5
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,306
Tansy! There you are.

6
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,980
I can't see her! Tansy, Tansy!

7
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,193
Tansy!

8
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:38,449
If you make it out of the woods, you win!

9
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,910
Run, Tansy, run!

10
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,255
-Tansy.
-Where is she?

11
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,258
Tansy, Tansy, Tansy!

12
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:19,657
Good girls. Down, girls. Down.

13
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,620
-Well done. You too.
-I only wounded her.

14
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,955
You brought her down. That's what matters.

15
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:30,835
-A fine shot. Wasn't it, Reek?
-A fine shot, master. My lady.

16
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:35,798
-My lord. It hurts. Please.
-Oh, sweet. Don't cry.

17
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:37,967
It will be over soon.

18
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,556
She thinks she's pretty.
Let me put one through her face.

19
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:46,851
We have to reward the hounds, love.
They did all the hard work.

20
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:49,228
Why? I did whatever you asked.

21
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,648
But you made Myranda feel jealous.

22
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,108
-Me jealous of her?
-My lord, please.

23
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:57,070
You can see that your presence
has become a bit of a problem.

24
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,658
Rip her! Rip her! Rip her!

25
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,789
Not so pretty now.

26
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:23,763
Your new hand,
it's nicer than the old one.

27
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,684
-Wouldn't you agree, Pod?
-Is it solid gold?

28
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:32,438
Gilded steel. You're not eating.
Why is no one eating?

29
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,566
My wife wastes away
and my brother starves himself.

30
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,653
-I'm not hungry.
-You lost a hand, not a stomach.

31
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,322
Try the boar.

32
00:04:41,656 --> 00:04:44,450
Cersei can't get enough of it
since one killed Robert for her.

33
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:47,662
A toast.

34
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,416
To the proud Lannister children.

35
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:54,085
The dwarf, the cripple,
and the mother of madness.

36
00:04:55,294 --> 00:04:57,505
-I'll clean it up.
-No, I'll do it. Leave us.

37
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,343
It's only wine.

38
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,565
-I can't fight anymore.
-What about your left?

39
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,319
I can hold a sword,
but all my instincts are wrong.

40
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,574
How can I protect the king
when I can hardly wipe my own ass?

41
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,118
You're the Lord Commander now. Command.

42
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,203
Let others do the fighting.

43
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,458
When was the last time
Father used a sword?

44
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,501
I'm not Father. I'm the Kingslayer.

45
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:38,129
When people find out
I can't slay a pigeon...

46
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:41,257
Train, then.
Learn to fight with your other hand.

47
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,218
With whom? You? Men talk.

48
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:47,013
Soon as someone discovers I can't fight,
he'll tell everyone.

49
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:55,897
You need a proper, discreet swordsman.
As it happens, I have just the one.

50
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,116
My brother tells me
you can keep your mouth shut.

51
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,911
Unusual talent for a sellsword.

52
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,539
He tells me you shit gold
just like your father.

53
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,793
Is this place safe?

54
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:23,174
There's this knight, Leygood,
got thunderbolts on his shield.

55
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:28,679
Right here is where I fuck his wife.
She's a screamer, that one.

56
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,724
If they don't hear her,
they won't hear us.

57
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:38,773
I've never seen Valyrian steel before.
She's a beauty. The problem is,

58
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,068
if you fight with an edged blade,
I'll have to.

59
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,322
And if I fight with an edged blade,
I'll have no one left to pay me.

60
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,952
I haven't used a sparring sword
since I was nine.

61
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,920
Bold warrior you are,
attacking a man when his guard's down.

62
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,588
Best time to attack a man.

63
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,592
Mind yourself.

64
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,139
-If I still had my right hand...
-Plan on growing it back?

65
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:28,114
Come on, then.

66
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,961
Open the gates!

67
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:44,589
Riders coming in!

68
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:03,524
Let's get these horses seen to!

69
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,321
Father, welcome home.

70
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,199
Walda, this is Ramsay Snow, my bastard.

71
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:13,576
A pleasure, Mother.

72
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,038
Hello.

73
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:19,457
See that the horses are fed,
watered, and rubbed down.

74
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,958
And take Lady Walda to her chambers.

75
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:23,961
This way, my lady.

76
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:28,382
-Where is your prize?
-With the hounds.

77
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,260
I'll have a look at him.

78
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:39,810
I hear you took a hand
from the Kingslayer.

79
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:43,981
Word travels. How he screamed.
You would have loved it.

80
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:55,910
Father...

81
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,545
What did you do to him?

82
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:11,050
I trained him.
He was a slow learner, but he learned.

83
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:15,179
-You flayed him.
-Peeled a few bits.

84
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,640
Removed a few others.

85
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,104
This was Balon Greyjoy's son and heir.

86
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,564
We've been flaying
our enemies for a thousand years.

87
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:29,235
-The flayed man is on our banners.
-My banners, not yours.

88
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,195
You're not a Bolton. You're a Snow.

89
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,451
Tywin Lannister has given me the North.

90
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,829
But he won't lift a finger
to help me take it.

91
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:44,083
As long as the ironborn hold Moat Cailin,
our armies are trapped south of the Neck.

92
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:47,670
Theon was a valuable hostage,
not your plaything.

93
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:52,466
-I wanted to trade him for Moat Cailin.
-I already asked.

94
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:56,762
Lord Greyjoy refused. Savages have no--

95
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,515
You sent terms to Balon Greyjoy
without my consent?

96
00:09:59,598 --> 00:10:02,935
You made me
acting Lord of the Dreadfort. I acted.

97
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,736
I had to smuggle myself
into my own lands

98
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,112
thanks to the Greyjoys.

99
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,450
I needed Theon. I needed him whole.

100
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,202
Theon was our enemy.

101
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:22,538
But Reek...

102
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,333
Reek will never betray us.

103
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,045
I placed far too much trust in you.

104
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:42,391
Reek, how could you let me stand
before my father unshaven?

105
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:45,436
-It's disrespectful.
-I'm sorry, my lord.

106
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:48,981
Give him the razor.

107
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:01,243
If I'm not a Bolton, Father,
what does it matter?

108
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:13,005
Go on, Reek. A nice close shave.

109
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:37,029
Reek... tell Father...

110
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,990
where are Bran and Rickon Stark?

111
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:43,828
-I don't know, my lord.
-You murdered them.

112
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,456
And displayed their corpses at Winterfell.

113
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,750
Reek...

114
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,379
did you murder the Stark boys?

115
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:57,466
No, my lord. Just two farm boys.

116
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,885
And crisped them, so no one would know.

117
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,138
Yes, my lord.

118
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,184
The Starks have always ruled the North.

119
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:12,022
If Bran and Rickon are alive,
the country will rally to their side.

120
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,650
Now, that Robb Stark is gone.

121
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,488
That's right, Reek.

122
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,159
Robb Stark is dead.

123
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:25,744
Sorry.

124
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,539
I know he was like a brother to you.

125
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,333
But my father put a knife
through his heart.

126
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:35,838
How do you feel about that?

127
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,438
-You ready for a hunt?
-Always.

128
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:55,608
Find those boys and I'll give you
a thousand acres and a holdfast.

129
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,820
Your pet rat have any thoughts
on which way they went after Winterfell?

130
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,658
Jon Snow is at Castle Black.

131
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,328
Who the fuck is Jon Snow?

132
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:09,121
Their bastard brother.

133
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,750
He could be sheltering them.
He may know where they are.

134
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:19,465
Even if he doesn't, he's half Stark
himself. Could be a threat.

135
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,967
You want to prove yourself a Bolton?

136
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,513
Gather whatever men you can
and ride for Moat Cailin.

137
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:27,973
Bring this creature of yours.

138
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,851
Maybe he'll be of some use.

139
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,066
Take the Moat for the family,
for our family.

140
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,318
And I'll reconsider your position.

141
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:46,408
Lord Varys, breakfasting with the king?

142
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,828
I'm afraid foreigners aren't welcome
at such exclusive affairs.

143
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:50,913
Oh, to be foreign.

144
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:56,335
Shae has been noticed.
Sansa's maid saw you with her.

145
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:57,586
She already told your sister.

146
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,172
It's only a matter of time
before your father hears.

147
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,801
So, I'm guilty of being seen
with my own wife's handmaiden.

148
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,594
My father will ask you
if there's anything more

149
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,430
-and you'll tell him some clever lie.
-No, I will not.

150
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,892
How long do you imagine your father
and sister would let me live

151
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,477
if they suspected me of lying?

152
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:18,857
I have no pet sellsword to protect me.
No legendary brother to avenge me.

153
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:23,195
-Only little birds who whisper in my ear.
-Forgive me if I don't weep for you.

154
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:26,031
No one weeps for spiders or whores.

155
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,410
I have friends across the sea
who could help her.

156
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:32,454
She won't leave.
I've told her this is a dangerous place

157
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,331
so many times,
she no longer believes it.

158
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:37,251
Your father has promised to hang
the next whore he finds you with.

159
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:40,296
Have you ever known your father
to make an idle threat?

160
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,051
From House Tyrell
and the people of the Reach,

161
00:14:46,885 --> 00:14:49,680
Your Grace, it is my honor
to present you with this wedding cup.

162
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,685
May you and my daughter Margaery
drink deep and live long.

163
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:56,854
A handsome goblet, My Lord.

164
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,481
Or shall I call you Father?

165
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,275
I should be honored, Your Grace.

166
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,703
She's the whore I told you about.
The dark-haired one.

167
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:18,083
Have her brought to the Tower
of the Hand before the wedding.

168
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,847
-A book?
-"The Lives of Four Kings."

169
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:35,309
Grand Maester Kaeth's history
of the reigns of Daeron the Young Dragon,

170
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:39,396
Baelor the Blessed, Aegon the Unworthy,
and Daeron the Good.

171
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,148
A book every king should read.

172
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:55,371
Now, that the war is won,
we should all find time for wisdom.

173
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,415
Thank you, Uncle.

174
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,347
One of only two Valyrian steel swords
in the capital,

175
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:17,017
Your Grace,
freshly forged in your honor.

176
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:34,118
Careful, Your Grace.
Nothing cuts like Valyrian steel.

177
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,577
So, they say.

178
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:51,009
Such a great sword should have a name.
What shall I call her?

179
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:55,180
-Stormbringer. Terminus!
-Widow's Wail.

180
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:57,182
-Wolfsbane.
-Widow's Wail. I like that.

181
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,438
Every time I use it, it'll be like
cutting off Ned Stark's head

182
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,522
all over again.

183
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:33,135
Don't.

184
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:37,598
You want me on the desk?

185
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,895
-What's wrong, my lion?
-Don't call me that.

186
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,230
What should I call you?

187
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,358
I'm afraid
our friendship can't continue.

188
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,403
Our friendship?

189
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,572
There's a ship waiting in the harbor
bound for Pentos.

190
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,493
-What?
-You'll have your own cabin, of course,

191
00:17:58,076 --> 00:18:01,371
and across the Narrow Sea
a house, servants.

192
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,126
-What is this?
-I'm a married man.

193
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,339
My wife has suffered a great deal,
as you well know.

194
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,925
I don't want her to suffer anymore
on my account.

195
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,510
I need to uphold my vows.

196
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:18,013
She doesn't want you.

197
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:20,599
-I need to do right by her.
-You don't want her.

198
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:21,642
By our children.

199
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,480
-What are you afraid of?
-I'm not afraid.

200
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:30,275
You are. You are afraid
of your father and your sister.

201
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,402
-You're going to run away all your life?
-I need you to leave.

202
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:35,781
I'm not afraid of them.
I'm not going to run.

203
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:37,741
-Shae.
-We will fight them together.

204
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,202
It's like you said,
I am yours and you are mine.

205
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,328
You're a whore!

206
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:47,918
Sansa is fit to bear my children
and you are not.

207
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:52,506
I can't be in love with a whore.
I can't have children with a whore.

208
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:57,177
How many men have you been with?
Five hundred? Five thousand?

209
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,853
How many whores have you been with?

210
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,188
I have enjoyed my time with all of them,

211
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,440
and I have enjoyed my time
with you most of all.

212
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:11,817
But now that time is over.

213
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:30,961
You'll have a comfortable life in Pentos.

214
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,966
Bronn will escort you to your ship.

215
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:03,619
Hear us now.

216
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:09,041
Accept these tokens of our faith, My Lord,
and lead us from the darkness.

217
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:13,587
Sire, I served you well.

218
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:16,048
-Lord of Light, show us the way...
-Lord of Light, show us the way...

219
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,799
-... from the darkness.
-Selyse...

220
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,218
...you're my sister!

221
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:24,473
-Yours are the stars that guide us.
-Tell him! Tell him!

222
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:28,936
Lord of Light, protect us,
for the night is dark and full of terrors.

223
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,617
Did you see? Their souls.

224
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:48,830
It was their souls.
Our lord took them. Did you see?

225
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,548
Lord Florent was your brother by law.

226
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,051
He was an infidel.

227
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:05,389
He worshiped the gods of his fathers
and their fathers before him.

228
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:08,141
They were the gods of your fathers too.

229
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:11,687
I ordered him to tear down his idols.
He disobeyed.

230
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:15,399
How many ships did he bring
to your cause? How many men?

231
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,109
A good deal more than you.

232
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,279
Did you see, Ser Davos?

233
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:25,492
They're with our lord now.
Their sins all burned away. Did you see?

234
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,744
I'm sure they're more
than grateful, my queen.

235
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:43,844
Meat's off.

236
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:49,975
-Our larders are almost empty.
-Serve fish, then. We're on an island.

237
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:51,143
You hate fish.

238
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,021
I hate a good many things,
but I suffer them all the same.

239
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:59,568
When Storm's End
was under siege and I was starving,

240
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:03,280
Stannis boiled soup for me from books.

241
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,950
The binding glue is made from horses.

242
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:14,332
One morning,
he shot two seagulls on the beach.

243
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:17,794
I've never tasted anything
as good as grilled seagull.

244
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:21,631
-Do you remember?
-Of course I remember.

245
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,012
Have you ever known true hunger, my lady?

246
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:31,391
-That's all I knew when I was a child.
-Until you found the Lord of Light?

247
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,643
Until he found me.

248
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,445
I fear for our daughter's soul.

249
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:47,240
Every mother should fear
for her child's soul.

250
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,284
-She's a stubborn little beast.
-She's a child.

251
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,621
You barely know her.
You think she's sweet

252
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:54,372
because she smiles when you visit.

253
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,666
She's sullen and stubborn and sinful.

254
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,795
Why else would the Lord of Light
have seen fit to mark her face?

255
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,338
She needs the rod.

256
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:04,257
She's my daughter.
You will not strike her.

257
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:07,803
As you command.

258
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,848
Perhaps the Lady Melisandre
could speak with her.

259
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:21,650
Come in.

260
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:25,779
Were you sleeping, Princess?

261
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:33,328
Did you watch the ceremony on the beach?

262
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:34,746
I heard it.

263
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,415
And it frightened you?

264
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:41,211
Ser Axel was my uncle.
He was always kind to me.

265
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,505
They're in a better place now, Princess.

266
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,882
The fire cleansed them
of the sins of the world.

267
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:49,469
-But they screamed.
-Women scream when they give birth.

268
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:54,266
-Afterward they are filled with joy.
-Afterward they aren't ash and bone.

269
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,143
You have so many questions, don't you?

270
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,313
So did I when I was a child.
I was much like you.

271
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,233
Only I wasn't a princess.

272
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,652
-And you didn't have this.
-No.

273
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:09,656
But I suffered in other ways,
sweet girl, believe me.

274
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:12,492
What do you know of the gods?

275
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:17,289
-I read "The Seven-Pointed Star."
-Lies and fables.

276
00:24:18,498 --> 00:24:21,668
Septons speak of seven gods.
There are but two.

277
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:27,883
A god of light and love and joy,
and a god of darkness, evil, and fear.

278
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:29,885
Eternally at war.

279
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:33,930
Then there are no seven heavens
and no seven hells?

280
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:37,642
There's only one hell, Princess.

281
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,312
The one we live in now.

282
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:16,932
Hodor.

283
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,106
-Why did you wake me?
-You've been gone for hours.

284
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:27,984
I was hungry.

285
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,947
-We're all hungry.
-I was just eating.

286
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,531
Summer was eating.

287
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,535
Your body can't live on the food
your wolf consumes.

288
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:40,747
Spending too much time
in Summer's skin is dangerous.

289
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:44,334
You're not a direwolf, Bran.

290
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:48,797
Must be glorious, though.

291
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:52,801
To run, to leap, to hunt.

292
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:55,845
To be whole.

293
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:58,515
I know it's tempting,

294
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,393
but if you're trapped in Summer
for too long,

295
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,978
you'll forget what it was to be human.

296
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,067
You'd forget us, Bran.

297
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:13,154
You'd forget your mother and father.
You'd forget your brothers and sisters.

298
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:17,200
You'd forget Winterfell.
You'd forget you.

299
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:20,954
And if we lose you, we lose everything.

300
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:55,613
Hodor, take me to the tree.

301
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:45,413
Look for me...

302
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:52,962
beneath the tree.

303
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:58,927
He saw us.

304
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,891
North.

305
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:15,944
I know where we have to go.

306
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:06,703
Let it be known
that Margaery of House Tyrell

307
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:10,165
and Joffrey of the Houses
Lannister and Baratheon

308
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,502
are one heart, one flesh, one soul.

309
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:19,174
Cursed be he
who would seek to tear them asunder.

310
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:26,598
With this kiss, I pledge my love.

311
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:50,246
We have a new queen.

312
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,334
Better her than you.

313
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:09,349
-Bit much, wouldn't you say?
-It feels proportionate.

314
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:12,435
-Proportionate to what?
-The expected extravagance.

315
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:15,104
People who spend their money
on this sort of nonsense

316
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,397
tend not to have it for long.

317
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:20,026
You ought to try enjoying something
before you die.

318
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,986
-You might find it suits you.
-Will I?

319
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,572
Not now, Mace.
Lord Tywin and I are speaking.

320
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:27,534
Anyway, I don't know
what you're complaining about.

321
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:30,453
-I'm paying my share.
-Shall we stick golden roses

322
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:33,331
on half the meat pies
to commemorate your generosity?

323
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:36,543
No, your heartfelt thank-you
is its own reward.

324
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,462
I would imagine
I'd be hearing it again before long.

325
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,673
Wars are rather expensive.

326
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,551
"The Iron Bank will have its due."

327
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,428
How they love to remind everyone.

328
00:30:47,845 --> 00:30:50,431
Almost as much as you Lannisters
with your debts.

329
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,600
I'm not worried about the Iron Bank.

330
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,060
We both know you're smarter than that.

331
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:58,773
Come, Tywin, let us celebrate young love.

332
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:12,662
All taken care of.

333
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:16,040
-You saw her board the ship?
-Aye, she's on it.

334
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,834
And you saw the ship sail away?

335
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:20,920
No one knows she's there
but you, me, and Varys.

336
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:22,714
How do you know?

337
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,967
Because if someone follows me
without an invitation,

338
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,510
I'm the last person they ever follow.

339
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,220
There's someone following you?

340
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:32,432
She's gone.

341
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:35,351
I know you don't want to believe it,
but she is.

342
00:31:35,893 --> 00:31:38,605
Now, go drink till it feels like you did
the right thing.

343
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,362
Hello.

344
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,573
-Hello.
-Not you.

345
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:10,386
You look exquisite, child.
The wind has been at you, though.

346
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:14,140
I haven't had the opportunity to tell you

347
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,018
how sorry I was to hear
about your brother.

348
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:22,106
War is war, but killing a man
at a wedding, horrid.

349
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,692
What sort of monster
would do such a thing?

350
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:28,321
As if men need more reasons
to fear marriage.

351
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:31,574
-My lady. My lady.
-Lord Tyrion, you see?

352
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,786
Not as bad as all that.
Perhaps if your pauper husband

353
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:37,413
were to sell his mule
and his last pair of shoes,

354
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:40,375
he might be able to afford
to bring you to Highgarden for a visit.

355
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:43,544
Now, that peace has come
and all is right with the world,

356
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,755
it would do you good to see some of it.

357
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:50,718
You must excuse me. It's time I ate
some of this food I paid for.

358
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:59,602
A coat of gold or a coat of red

359
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:05,441
A lion still has claws

360
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,569
And mine, my lord

361
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:11,114
Very good. Very good. Off you go.

362
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:30,425
My love, why don't we make
the announcement?

363
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,137
Everyone...

364
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,474
the queen would like to say a few words.

365
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,944
We are so fortunate
to enjoy this marvelous food and drink.

366
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,238
Not all among us are so lucky.

367
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:56,576
To thank the gods for bringing
the recent war to a just end,

368
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:58,870
King Joffrey has decreed

369
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:03,750
that the leftovers from our feast
be given to the poorest in his city.

370
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,138
You're an example to us all.

371
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:37,325
-Ser Jaime, I'm very sorry.
-Ser Loras, it's quite all right.

372
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:43,664
-Your sister looks very beautiful.
-As does yours.

373
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,667
So, you looking forward to your wedding?

374
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,462
Yes, very much.

375
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:51,714
Our fathers are both rather keen
on the prospect.

376
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:54,258
-They certainly are.
-Perhaps they should get married.

377
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,598
If you were to marry Cersei,
she'd murder you in your sleep.

378
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:04,644
If you somehow managed
to put a child in her first,

379
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:08,231
she'd murder him too,
long before he drew his first breath.

380
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:13,444
Luckily for you, none of this will happen
because you'll never marry her.

381
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,825
And neither will you.

382
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,007
Your Grace. My king.

383
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:36,634
-My Queen.
-Lady Brienne.

384
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,596
-So good of you to come.
-I'm no lady, Your Grace.

385
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,639
Did you just bow?

386
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:46,769
Apologies, Your Grace.
I never did master the curtsy.

387
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,021
You're the one who put a sword
through Renly Baratheon.

388
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,858
That's not true, my love.
Brienne had nothing to do with it.

389
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:56,112
A shame. I'd knight the man
that put an end to that deviant's life.

390
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:00,992
I just wanted to congratulate you both
and wish you good fortune.

391
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,952
The country has been at war too long.

392
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,788
I hope your reign is long and peaceful.

393
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,707
-Yes, yes.
-Thank you.

394
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,709
I hope we see more of you.

395
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,634
Lady Brienne,

396
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:22,054
you're Lord Selwyn Tarth's daughter.

397
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,932
That makes you a lady
whether you want to be or not.

398
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:28,394
-As you say, Your Grace.
-I owe you my gratitude.

399
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:31,230
You returned my brother safely
to King's Landing.

400
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,818
In truth, he rescued me, Your Grace.

401
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:37,612
More than once.

402
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:39,864
Did he?

403
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,325
Haven't heard that story before.

404
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,829
Not such a fascinating story, I'm afraid.

405
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:49,081
I'm sure you have many
fascinating stories.

406
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:53,252
Sworn to Renly Baratheon. Sworn
to Catelyn Stark. And now my brother.

407
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:56,797
Must be exciting to flit
from one camp to the next

408
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:59,425
serving whichever lord or lady you fancy.

409
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,761
I don't serve your brother, Your Grace.

410
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:04,180
But you love him.

411
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,522
Your Grace.

412
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:28,871
No, no, come to my chambers
and I will examine you personally.

413
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,040
-She'll do no such thing.
-Oh, Your Grace.

414
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:33,584
Yes, well, this young lady
sought my advice--

415
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,378
You should see Qyburn. He's quite good.

416
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:38,255
-Your Grace.
-Qyburn? Deplorable man.

417
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:41,217
Brought shame on the Citadel
with his repugnant experiments.

418
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,928
More repugnant than your gnarled fingers
on that girl's thighs?

419
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,013
Your Grace, I am a man of learning.

420
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:49,558
My little brother had you sent
to the Black Cells when you annoyed him.

421
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,310
What do you think I could do to you
if you annoyed me?

422
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:56,107
-I never meant to annoy anyone.
-But you are. You annoy me right now.

423
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:58,401
Every breath you draw
in my presence annoys me.

424
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:01,278
So, here's what I want you to do.
I want you to leave my presence.

425
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:03,280
Leave this wedding right now.

426
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:06,867
Go to the kitchens and instruct them
that all the leftovers from the feast

427
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:08,327
will be brought to the kennels.

428
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:10,496
Your Grace, Queen Margaery--

429
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:15,251
The queen is telling you
the leftovers will feed the dogs,

430
00:38:16,002 --> 00:38:17,086
or you will.

431
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:39,317
A gold dragon to whoever knocks
my fool's hat off.

432
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,706
-You're in rather a good mood.
-I suppose I am.

433
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:56,834
-I won't ask why.
-Small pleasures.

434
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,628
-Your Grace. Lord Tywin.
-Prince Oberyn.

435
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,589
I don't believe you have met Ellaria.

436
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:05,551
This is the Lord Hand Tywin Lannister
and Cersei Lannister the Queen Regent.

437
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:08,262
I suppose it is former Queen Regent now.

438
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:11,474
Lord Hand and Lady Cersei,

439
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,478
-Ellaria Sand.
-My lord. My lady.

440
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,146
Charmed.

441
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,857
Can't say I've ever met a Sand before.

442
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:27,823
We are everywhere in Dorne.
I have ten thousand brothers and sisters.

443
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,658
Bastards are born of passion, aren't they?

444
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:33,162
-We don't despise them in Dorne.
-No? How tolerant of you.

445
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:37,333
I expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei,
giving up your regal responsibilities.

446
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:41,128
Wearing the crown for so many years
must have left your neck a bit crooked.

447
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,588
I suppose you'll never know,
Prince Oberyn.

448
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:45,132
It's a shame your older brother
couldn't attend the wedding.

449
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,093
Please give him our regards.

450
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,553
With any luck,
the gout will abate with time

451
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:50,888
and he will be able to walk again.

452
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:54,350
They call it the rich man's disease.
A wonder you don't have it.

453
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:57,394
Noblemen in my part of the country
don't enjoy the same lifestyle

454
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:58,938
as our counterparts in Dorne.

455
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:00,606
People everywhere have their differences.

456
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:04,193
In some places, the highborn
frown upon those of low birth.

457
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:07,488
In other places the rape
and murder of women and children

458
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,156
is considered distasteful.

459
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:14,620
What a fortunate thing for you,
former Queen Regent,

460
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:18,165
that your daughter Myrcella has been sent
to live in the latter sort of place.

461
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:26,006
Everyone, silence! Clear the floor.

462
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:32,346
There's been too much...
amusement here today.

463
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:36,350
A royal wedding is not an amusement.

464
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:39,353
A royal wedding is history.

465
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:44,066
The time has come for all of us
to contemplate our history.

466
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,069
My lords...

467
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:50,698
my ladies...

468
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:53,409
I give you...

469
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:58,998
King Joffrey, Renly, Stannis,

470
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:02,710
Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy.

471
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:06,005
The War of the Five Kings.

472
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,051
I'm the rightful king.

473
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:14,680
-King in the North!
-Yes!

474
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,396
Traitor. You're a traitor.

475
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,524
For the Seven Kingdoms!

476
00:41:30,279 --> 00:41:31,947
Let the war begin.

477
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:36,118
Renly, you're no king.

478
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:39,872
Away, degenerate. Away. Away.

479
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:42,583
Careful.

480
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,252
-Go on.
-I want you to be my prince.

481
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:54,720
Stannis!

482
00:41:55,512 --> 00:41:57,223
Who's got the gold now, Stark?

483
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,768
-I am the rightful king.
-Challenge me, ruffian.

484
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:02,728
-Take that.
-I'm drowning. I'm drowning.

485
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:04,813
I am the King in the North!

486
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:10,611
Not wildfire!

487
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:21,622
Pay each of them 20 gold
when this is done.

488
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,207
Yes, my lord.

489
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,793
We'll have to find another way
to thank the king.

490
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:31,382
Charge!

491
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:38,931
Ready, again.

492
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:45,062
I am the King in the North!

493
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,440
-Charge!
-Charge!

494
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:51,193
-Yes!
-Your head!

495
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:29,565
Fine gentlemen.

496
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,618
Well fought. Well fought.

497
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:44,330
Here you are. Champion's purse.

498
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:50,044
Though you're not
the champion yet, are you?

499
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:53,797
A true champion
defeats all the challengers.

500
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:58,385
Surely there are others out there
who still dare to challenge my reign.

501
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:04,099
Uncle, how about you?
I... I'm sure they have a spare costume.

502
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:13,400
One taste of combat
was enough for me, Your Grace.

503
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:16,111
I would like to keep
what remains of my face.

504
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:18,238
I think you should fight him.

505
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,407
This was but a poor imitation

506
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,326
of your own bravery
on the field of battle.

507
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,828
I speak as a firsthand witness.

508
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:28,457
Climb down from the high table
with your new Valyrian sword

509
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:32,086
and show everyone
how a true king wins his throne.

510
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:37,633
Be careful, though.
This one is clearly mad with lust.

511
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:41,261
It would be a tragedy for the king
to lose his virtue

512
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,347
hours before his wedding night.

513
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:17,798
A fine vintage. Shame that it spilled.

514
00:45:19,174 --> 00:45:21,260
-It did not spill.
-My love, come back to me.

515
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:23,887
It's time for my father's toast.

516
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:28,308
Well, how does he expect me
to toast without wine?

517
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:34,690
Uncle... you can be my cupbearer,

518
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,651
seeing as you're too cowardly to fight.

519
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:39,653
Your Grace does me a great honor.

520
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:42,823
It's not meant as an honor.

521
00:46:14,646 --> 00:46:15,772
Bring me my goblet.

522
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:40,714
What good is an empty cup?

523
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,258
Fill it.

524
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:58,398
Kneel.

525
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:02,986
Kneel before your king.

526
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:09,576
Kneel.

527
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:18,335
I said...

528
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:20,379
kneel!

529
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:25,551
Look, the pie.

530
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:41,275
My queen.

531
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:55,080
Wonderful.

532
00:47:56,873 --> 00:47:57,791
Wonderful.

533
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:00,794
My hero.

534
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:07,801
-Can we leave now?
-Let's find out.

535
00:48:16,602 --> 00:48:17,561
Uncle...

536
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:24,109
where are you going?
You're my cupbearer, remember?

537
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:27,404
I thought I might change out
of these wet clothes, Your Grace.

538
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:29,906
No, no, no.
No, you're perfect the way you are.

539
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:32,993
Serve me my wine.

540
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:41,293
Well, hurry up. This pie is dry.

541
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:51,553
Good.

542
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:54,014
Needs washing down.

543
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,975
-If it please Your Grace, Lady Sansa...
-No.

544
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:57,976
...is very tired.

545
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:01,021
No, you'll wait here...

546
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:05,317
Un...

547
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:08,737
Your Grace?

548
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:13,283
It's nothing.

549
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:21,500
-He's choking!
-Help the poor boy.

550
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:27,422
-Idiots, help your king.
-Move away!

551
00:49:31,176 --> 00:49:33,887
-Joffrey! Joffrey!
-Help him!

552
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:36,807
What's going on?

553
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,475
-Come with me now.
-Joffrey! Joffrey!

554
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:40,018
Joffrey! Joffrey!

555
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:43,230
-If you want to live, we have to leave.
-Don't touch him!

556
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:53,699
Joffrey. Please, Joffrey.

557
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:56,910
No, I can't-- what is...

558
00:49:58,495 --> 00:49:59,705
Help him!

559
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:33,822
My son.

560
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:44,166
He's gone. Our king is gone.

561
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,334
He did this.

562
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:51,590
He poisoned my son.

563
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:53,550
Your king.

564
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,595
Take him. Take him!

565
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:58,889
Take him!

566
00:50:59,848 --> 00:51:00,766
Take him!

567
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:32,756
In a coat of gold or a coat of red

568
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:38,470
A lion still has claws

569
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:45,352
And mine are long and sharp, my lord

570
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:50,649
As long and sharp as yours

571
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:57,239
And so he spoke, and so he spoke

572
00:51:57,739 --> 00:52:03,286
That Lord of Castamere

573
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:09,626
And now the rains, weep o'er his hall

574
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:15,340
With no one there to hear

575
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:22,013
Yes, now the rains, weep o'er his hall

576
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:27,435
And not a soul to hear
