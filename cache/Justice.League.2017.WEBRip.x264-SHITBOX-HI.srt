a war over.

He's completely off the grid.

Moves suddenly and often.

his father.</i>

184

In prison for murdering
his mother.

Check yes or no."

<i>up in the sky.</i>

1453
01:48:29,580 --> 01:48:30,850
(SONIC BOOM)

1454
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:26,540
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate you doing this.

1455
01:49:26,540 --> 01:49:27,780
Not at all, Barry.

1456
01:49:28,640 --> 01:49:30,080
Curious myself.

1457
01:49:30,080 --> 01:49:31,680
Yeah, and it's not like
a competition, you know?

1458
01:49:31,680 --> 01:49:33,950
Well, it is a competition.

1459
01:49:33,950 --> 01:49:37,150
But, you know, it's not like
a macho measuring thing.

1460
01:49:37,150 --> 01:49:38,650
But if I win,
you're off the team.

1461
01:49:41,820 --> 01:49:43,960
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

1462
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:46,530
- No...
- Oof.

1463
01:49:47,630 --> 01:49:49,490
If I win,

1464
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:52,760
Bruce said something about you
having to take us all to brunch?

1465
01:49:52,770 --> 01:49:55,470
Oh, see, now that's cold.
That's a betrayal.

1466
01:49:55,470 --> 01:49:56,770
I feel stung by that.

1467
01:49:58,740 --> 01:50:00,410
Okay, but if I win,
I get to tell everyone.

1468
01:50:00,410 --> 01:50:01,610
Deal.

1469
01:50:02,340 --> 01:50:03,940
Which coast?

1470
01:50:03,940 --> 01:50:05,880
Ah, you know,
I've never seen the Pacific.

1471
01:50:07,510 --> 01:50:08,750
Which is that way.

1472
01:50:08,750 --> 01:50:11,820
Because the sun and it's...

1473
01:57:52,680 --> 01:57:54,380
(DOOR BUZZES)

1474
01:57:54,380 --> 01:57:57,620
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

1475
01:57:57,620 --> 01:57:59,450
GUARD 1: All right,
let's keep it moving.

1476
01:57:59,450 --> 01:58:01,250
GUARD 2: (ON RADIO)
<i>Come on, Luthor. Let's go.</i>

1477
01:58:02,520 --> 01:58:03,520
<i>Luthor!</i>

1478
01:58:12,800 --> 01:58:14,330
All right,
stop jerking around, Luthor,

1479
01:58:14,340 --> 01:58:15,740
or I'm gonna have
to come in there.

1480
01:58:21,810 --> 01:58:24,510
(LAUGHING)

1481
01:58:48,870 --> 01:58:51,240
Ah! There he is. Welcome aboard.

1482
01:58:51,240 --> 01:58:53,340
Care for a glass
of Goût de Diamants?

1483
01:58:53,340 --> 01:58:55,170
I was just celebrating
God's return

1484
01:58:55,180 --> 01:58:57,940
out of the ground
and back up into the sky.

1485
01:58:57,940 --> 01:59:01,410
He and his odd little friends
are forming some sort of league.

1486
01:59:01,420 --> 01:59:03,080
DEATHSTROKE: You better not
be wasting my time.

1487
01:59:03,080 --> 01:59:06,920
No. I have too much to live for
and more important things to do.

1488
01:59:06,920 --> 01:59:09,760
We have to level
the playing field, Mr. Wilson.

1489
01:59:10,790 --> 01:59:12,130
To put it plainly

1490
01:59:13,690 --> 01:59:16,700
shouldn't we have
a league of our own?

1491
01:59:16,724 --> 01:59:23,724
