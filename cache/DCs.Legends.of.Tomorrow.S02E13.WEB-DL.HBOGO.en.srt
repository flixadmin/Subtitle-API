1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,080
<i>Time travel is real</i>

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,560
<i>and all of history
is vulnerable to attack.</i>

3
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,320
<i>Which is why we must travel
through time</i>

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,200
<i>to stop the spread
of these so-called time aberrations</i>

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,400
<i>and to erase their damage to history.</i>

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,960
<i>We are a team of outcasts
and misfits.</i>

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,920
<i>So, please, don't call us heroes.</i>

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,040
<i>We're something else.</i>

9
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,320
<i>We're Legends.</i>

10
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,600
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

11
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,280
- It's a compass.
- Either of you gentlemen

12
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,200
heard of the Spear of Destiny?

13
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,080
The spear could alter reality itself.

14
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,120
We broke it
into four separate pieces.

15
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,240
Mr. Hunter took one.

16
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,760
And took the rest of you
to three different time periods,

17
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,360
which means
the last piece unaccounted for

18
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,760
must be with your grandfather.

19
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,360
I'm rounding up the fragments.

20
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,000
The Legion of Doom
are closing in on us as we speak.

21
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,720
You're here to finish me off,
Captain.

22
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,040
No, saving your life.

23
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,040
You are not captain,
and this is not your ship.

24
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,400
Not anymore.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Is there... is something wrong
with the interface?

26
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,960
I triple checked the connections,
and everything seems fine.

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,040
Look, it's an artifact from 33 A.D.

28
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,480
{\an5}talking to an AI
from the 22nd century.

29
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,920
You just gotta give it some time.

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,680
{\an5}- Hey, guys, anything?
- Not yet.

31
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,680
Are you sure Stargirl doesn't know
where my grandfather ended up?

32
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,600
{\an5}No, the JSA thought the pieces
of the spear would be safer

33
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,400
{\an5}if they didn't know
where Rip was dropping them off.

34
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,520
{\an5}Except Rip knows,

35
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,520
{\an5}which means the Legion of Doom
probably already knows.

36
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,960
They could already
have my grandfather,

37
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,280
or he could be dead,
or they're torturing him,

38
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,920
- or he's dying, or...
- We're not gonna let that happen.

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,680
It's not just about my grandfather.

40
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,920
It's about the entire fabric
of reality that's at stake here.

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,120
{\an5}Which you think would be
incentive enough

42
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,560
{\an5}for a certain talking computer
to buffer a little quicker.

43
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,000
<i>The name is Gideon,</i>

44
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,520
{\an5}<i>and I'm processing data
as fast as I can.</i>

45
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,080
Just... just chill out, bro,
all right?

46
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,840
Let Gideon do her thing.

47
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,640
Look, soon as we lock in
a location on the fragment,

48
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,960
we'll head there right away.

49
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,800
We're gonna save
your grandfather, and, you know...

50
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,040
the fabric of reality.

51
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,440
Hey, yo. I got an idea.

52
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,560
{\an5}If it's try to get Evil Rip
to tell us where and when

53
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,120
Commander Steel is, I already tried.

54
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,280
{\an5}- And he didn't tell you nothing?
- No, he told me a lot of things.

55
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,000
{\an5}All different variations
of "go to hell".

56
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,200
So what we gonna do with him?

57
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,560
Just leave him in the brig?

58
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,600
{\an5}Until we figure out
a way to restore his mind,

59
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,080
then yeah, that's the plan.

60
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,200
{\an5}At least in the brig,
he can't hurt anyone.

61
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,320
Gideon.

62
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,280
Gideon, I know you're there.

63
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,720
<i>I've been prohibited from responding
to your instructions, Mr. Hunter.</i>

64
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,840
"Mister?"

65
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,440
{\an5}Really, after everything
we've been through?

66
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,880
Wow, I'm wounded.

67
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,640
Spaniel.

68
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,720
Broad.

69
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,080
Tricycle.

70
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,440
<i>Please, do not make me do that.</i>

71
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,560
Spaniel.

72
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,720
Broad.

73
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,280
Tricycle.

74
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,920
<i>Very well... Captain.</i>

75
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,920
What?

76
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,320
- What's going on?
- I have no idea.

77
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,800
Gideon?

78
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,200
If this is about before, I'm sorry.

79
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,600
Gideon, what's going on?

80
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,320
<i>I'm sorry, but I have no recourse
but to follow the Captain's orders.</i>

81
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,400
Women.

82
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,640
I didn't give you any...

83
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,280
Rip.

84
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,920
Told you I could do it.

85
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,640
- What's going on?
- Rip is manipulating Gideon.

86
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,000
I thought we told her to ignore him.

87
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,120
<i>The Captain initiated
an override command</i>

88
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,960
<i>and is proceeding to the Jumpship.</i>

89
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,640
- Go stop him.
- You mean kill him?

90
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,840
- No, no killing.
- No fun.

91
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,720
We'll go with him
and make sure he doesn't kill.

92
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,040
Oh, come on.

93
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,360
Jax, I can't switch
to manual piloting.

94
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,240
Gideon's taken over
navigation controls.

95
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,040
Yeah, I can see that.

96
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,000
I think what she means is,
can you stop it?

97
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,960
I think I can reboot
the entire system,

98
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,640
including Gideon, but it means
shutting down the whole ship.

99
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,240
Do it.

100
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,720
Gideon, initiate Spectrum Protocol.

101
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,040
<i>Initiating.</i>

102
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,400
That's probably not good.

103
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,440
<i>Self-destruct sequence activated.</i>

104
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,120
That's definitely not good.

105
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,920
- Jax, what's your status?
- Give me a minute.

106
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,160
<i>You got four.</i>

107
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,520
Mr. Hunter.

108
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,160
Put down the gun.
We don't wanna hurt you.

109
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,320
Yeah, we do.

110
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,800
Give us the medallion.

111
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,160
The what?

112
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,480
Oh, you mean this.

113
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,040
Your singular hope
for finding the final piece

114
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,600
of the Spear of Destiny.

115
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,160
There's nowhere for you to run.

116
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,680
Truer words were never spoken.

117
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,960
No!

118
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,360
Okay, I'm ready to reboot

119
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,200
but we'll lose power
for five seconds.

120
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,920
Do it.

121
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,160
Navigation's still offline.

122
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,640
Everybody, you might want
to hold on to something.

123
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,640
So we're crash-landing again?

124
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,720
Fantastic.

125
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,600
You okay?

126
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,200
Oh, everything hurts.

127
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,560
Where are we?

128
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,800
<i>We have landed
in the Cretaceous Period.</i>

129
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,640
Call that a landing?

130
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,520
Gideon, are you back?

131
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,080
Yeah, are you still trying
to kill us?

132
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,160
<i>I am really
quite sorry about that.</i>

133
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,080
How many times
must I tell you people?

134
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,920
Mick Rory is not to pilot this ship.

135
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,800
It wasn't Mick. It was Gideon.

136
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,360
<i>I did apologize.</i>

137
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,480
Apparently,
we're in the Cretaceous Period.

138
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:17,920
<i>69,997,983 B.C., to be precise.</i>

139
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,440
{\an5}983? That's the exact year
where Rip's time-scatter left me.

140
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,040
That's a heck of a coincidence.

141
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,400
<i>Not entirely.</i>

142
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,120
<i>The sudden reconfiguration
of my navigation system</i>

143
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,000
<i>forced me to select
the oldest destination in my logs.</i>

144
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,320
{\an5}Gideon, I don't care how we got here,
just time-jump us out of here, now.

145
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,520
<i>Unfortunately, I am unable to.</i>

146
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,360
{\an5}<i>The ship's primary
temporal delineator</i>

147
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,360
<i>was lost during initial impact.</i>

148
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,760
But if we were able
to recover the delineator

149
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,480
and somehow effect repairs...

150
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,440
<i>All systems would return to normal.</i>

151
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,520
I'll go and get it.

152
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,120
My old neighborhood, after all.

153
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,960
All right, go.
Just take Nate and Amaya with you.

154
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,360
You don't need to be out there alone.

155
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,240
{\an5}Why don't I get to go
to Jurassic Park?

156
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,040
Because I need you to threaten Rip.

157
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,480
- Easy money.
- I said threaten, not hurt.

158
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,560
{\an5}With the medallion destroyed,
Captain Hunter is the only one

159
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,040
{\an5}who can tell us
where Commander Steel

160
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,160
and the final piece of the spear is.

161
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,480
Why don't we just get inside
his head?

162
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,320
- Well, if only that were possible.
- It is.

163
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,360
The Time Masters did it
to me all the time.

164
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,560
Did what?

165
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,000
Coggy-something.

166
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,400
<i>Cognitive Intrusion.</i>

167
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,520
That's it.

168
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,240
{\an5}<i>The process in which one
consciousness enters another.</i>

169
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,840
But, that's not possible.

170
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,160
<i>The technology was developed in 2137</i>

171
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,760
<i>by the Time Masters and used as
an extreme method of coercion.</i>

172
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,200
<i>CI devices came standard
with all Time Master vessels.</i>

173
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,280
Wait, so in theory,
we could go inside Rip's mind

174
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,560
and change him back?

175
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,680
<i>Correct.</i>

176
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,040
Told you.

177
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,120
Nothing like the fresh Cretaceous air
to get the heart pumping.

178
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,880
Come on, you two. Chop, chop!

179
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,480
Your grandfather is one
of the bravest men I know.

180
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,320
If anyone can hold off
the Legion of Doom, it's him.

181
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,080
Yeah, I hope you're right.

182
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,120
I usually am.

183
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,520
I've got a lock on the delineator.

184
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,720
Oh, no.

185
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,800
What is it?

186
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,440
It appears to be
in Gertrude's territory.

187
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,520
- Who's Gertrude?
- Oh, don't worry.

188
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,400
With the weather this cold,
she's probably hibernating.

189
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
Or not.

190
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,680
<i>Cognitive Intrusion creates
a brain link</i>

191
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,520
<i>between two or more subjects.</i>

192
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,920
<i>Captain Hunter considered it
barbaric and supremely dangerous.</i>

193
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,480
You two think you can figure
this Cognitive Intrusion thing out?

194
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,520
With the professor
as my assistant, yeah.

195
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,040
You cannot be serious.

196
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,960
Very serious. Get me a beer.

197
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,520
- So who's going in?
- I will.

198
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,240
I brought Rip onto the ship.

199
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,360
It's my responsibility.

200
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,360
No way.
I'm not letting you go in alone.

201
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,040
Did you not just hear
what Gideon said?

202
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,200
"Barbaric and supremely dangerous."

203
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,200
Which is why Sara needs backup.

204
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,600
And Rip believed in me.

205
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,160
There's a reason
he made me chief engineer.

206
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,600
You're the only engineer.

207
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,320
Point is, if there's any
of the old Rip left inside him,

208
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,600
I have to find out.

209
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,520
That's all well and good.
But remember, the priority has to be

210
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,640
discovering the whereabouts
of the final piece of the spear

211
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,800
and its protector.

212
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,480
The beer, Professor.

213
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,840
Oh, make it a six-pack.

214
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,800
So how far are
we from the delineator?

215
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,560
Looks like it's just up ahead.

216
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,240
You guys wait here.
I'll go check it out.

217
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,320
Thank you.

218
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,280
Well, at least somebody's
in his element.

219
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,160
I've always been more
of an indoorsy learner.

220
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,800
You give me a book about this time
and the wildlife in this era...

221
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,960
I'll be dropping knowledge bombs
like it's my job.

222
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,480
- Nate?
- What?

223
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,560
- Don't move.
- Why?

224
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,720
- Oh, my God.
- Stay calm.

225
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,400
Oh, my God, get it off.
Kick it, kill it, kill it!

226
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,560
Get it!

227
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,800
That was gross.

228
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,080
Let me guess.

229
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,160
- You're afraid of snakes.
- And you're not?

230
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,520
Animals only lash out
if they're provoked or desperate.

231
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,560
Your slithery friend
wasn't trying to hurt you.

232
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,120
He just thought you were part
of the tree.

233
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,800
So you commune with all animals?

234
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,520
You're like an attractive
Dr. Dolittle.

235
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,000
There is one animal
that can catch me off guard.

236
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,040
- Are you flirting with me?
- Maybe.

237
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,800
What happened to the whole
"teammates don't fraternize" thing?

238
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,880
Courtney.

239
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,000
Stargirl?

240
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,000
She gave me a little advice
on staying true to myself.

241
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,200
Maybe it's time I let go
of the old rules.

242
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,600
A lot's changed since I left 1942.

243
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,360
I've changed.

244
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,160
And...

245
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,680
maybe, exploring this...

246
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,120
whatever this is...

247
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,760
is not the worst idea.

248
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,040
It's not a bad idea at all.

249
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,240
- Run!
- What happened?

250
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,840
She may have picked up my scent!

251
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,720
Yep, she definitely did.

252
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,920
Question, what do we expect
when we get inside Rip's mind?

253
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,360
- No idea.
- Whoa, wait, what?

254
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,760
Well, I've seen it done, had it done,
never taken a trip myself.

255
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,160
Given that you're
entering his subconscious,

256
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,880
I suspect it will look
like someplace familiar

257
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,320
to our old Captain.

258
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,520
Here, put these on.

259
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,960
Gideon warned us
that you shouldn't stay

260
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,360
in the mindscape for longer
than an hour, lest the transfer

261
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,560
become permanent.

262
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,320
You mean we can get stuck
in Rip's mind forever?

263
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,400
Precisely.

264
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,640
But if you push the red button,

265
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,200
you will give yourself
an electric shock

266
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,040
that should bring you out.

267
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,440
Less talking, more doing.

268
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,720
Mick's right.

269
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,880
Crank it.

270
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,560
Good luck.

271
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,600
I think it worked.

272
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,560
I think we're inside Rip's mind.

273
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,080
Grey said Rip's brain
would look familiar.

274
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,520
Well, if this is the Waverider,

275
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,160
maybe we can find him
on the bridge.

276
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,240
Yeah.

277
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,120
Rip's memory
of Vandal Savage's troops.

278
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,400
If this place is filled
with all the bad stuff

279
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,080
Rip remembers about being
a Time Master...

280
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,880
Then this ship could be crawling
with creeps from every era.

281
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,800
We better get some firepower.

282
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,880
You sure these guns
are gonna work in here?

283
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,280
I don't know.

284
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,440
I ain't never been
in nobody's mind before.

285
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,680
Freeze!

286
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,880
Yeah, yeah,
I think they'll work just fine.

287
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,560
Sara.

288
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,160
You don't belong here.

289
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yo.

290
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:15,920
God, I'm a wench in Rip's mind.

291
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,520
If that's how he thinks of you
in his subconscious...

292
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,720
It explains why he wants
to kill us in real life.

293
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,720
If that's right, then...

294
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,400
Then there's more than
just bizarro me on this ship.

295
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,080
Like Evil Ray, Evil Stein.

296
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,480
Evil Mick.

297
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,600
I guess that's just
regular Mick, but still.

298
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,760
All right, let's find Rip,
get what we need

299
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,440
- and get out of here.
- Yeah.

300
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,200
I think... I think we ditched her.

301
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,560
Okay, quick question, Ray.

302
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,800
Your lady dinosaur friend,

303
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,120
you said she recognized your scent.

304
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,320
Wait, I believe
her name was Gertrude.

305
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,280
Right, I couldn't help
but get the feeling

306
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,160
that Gertrude
didn't like you very much.

307
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,160
Raymond, what aren't you telling us?

308
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,480
Well, it just so happens
that lady dinosaurs

309
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,680
are rather maternal.

310
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,760
And?

311
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,680
And I may have eaten one of her eggs.

312
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,240
But I was starving. I needed protein.

313
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,080
I mean, one egg made me,
like, 70 omelets.

314
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,240
I regret nothing.

315
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,480
All right, but you have to
tell us this before we walk

316
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,000
onto Gertrude's territory.

317
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,040
This is where the delineator landed.

318
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,720
Look, if you wanna stop
the Legion of Doom

319
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,600
from grabbing your grandfather's
piece of the spear,

320
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,800
we have to retrieve it.

321
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,760
We made it.

322
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,320
- Someone lives here?
- Used to.

323
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,840
It's where I survived for six months.

324
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,200
What's that smell?

325
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,480
Male T. rex urine.

326
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,960
The only way I figured
to keep Gertrude away

327
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,280
was to douse the place with it.

328
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,040
And where did you find
male T. rex urine?

329
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,440
- Well...
- Actually, I don't wanna know.

330
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,200
Do I wanna know what these are?

331
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,320
Huh.

332
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,160
That one looks
just like Captain Lance.

333
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,320
That looks like a little baby Rory.

334
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,440
I... I might have gotten
a little lonely.

335
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,160
But hey, the sun is setting.
Maybe I should go out

336
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,120
and catch us an iguana
and prepare some

337
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,040
of my world-famous iguana soup.

338
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,400
Nah, I'm good.
I brought energy bars from the ship.

339
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,960
What? Energy bars?

340
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,320
Come on, Nate.
We're in the Cretaceous Period.

341
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,520
You have to at least try
the local cuisine.

342
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,720
Eh, no.

343
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,080
All right.

344
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,960
Do not leave the urine perimeter!

345
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,440
- So.
- So.

346
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,480
Here we are,
waiting for fresh iguana

347
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,640
at Ray's "Cast Away" camp
during dinosaur times.

348
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,600
So this is our lives now.

349
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,640
I know you wanna get back
to the ship...

350
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,840
but there's really nothing
we can do right now except wait.

351
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,200
Not a thing.

352
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,280
Yoo-hoo!

353
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,080
Good thing I haven't forgotten
my survival skills.

354
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,120
Like riding a bike.

355
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,680
Wow, that's... that's great, Ray.

356
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,960
Okay. Once we find Rip,
how are we gonna get him

357
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,800
to tell us where
Nate's grandfather is if...

358
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,440
- If Rip thinks we're all evil?
- Yeah.

359
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,920
One problem at a time.

360
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,160
What's our other problem?

361
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,640
Go find Rip.
I'll hold these guys off.

362
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,280
You shouldn't have come here.

363
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,920
This is our ship.

364
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,400
But there's always room
for a pretty little thing like you.

365
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,600
We've got plenty
of extra room in the brig.

366
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,040
This is all in Rip's mind.
None of this is real.

367
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,760
You're not real.

368
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,360
Oh, really?

369
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,320
<i>Does that feel real?</i>

370
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,680
<i>Does that feel real?</i>

371
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,080
<i>Does that feel real?</i>

372
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,960
Hello?

373
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,320
Rip.

374
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,960
Get away from me!

375
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,120
Look, relax, it's okay.

376
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,640
I'm gonna get you out of here.

377
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,760
Get me out?

378
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,160
You put me in here.

379
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,160
SOS.

380
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,760
Sara.

381
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,320
Hey, Sara, it's me.

382
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,280
I didn't know you knew Morse Code.

383
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,080
<i>Mr. Jackson, I was hoping
you'd hear my signal.</i>

384
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,520
Who are you?

385
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,600
Really?

386
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,840
After all the time
we've spent together?

387
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,120
I think I would remember
if we had...

388
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:22,120
Are you a figment
of Rip's imagination?

389
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,960
Of sorts, but I'm very much real.

390
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,880
As real as the Waverider herself.

391
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,840
Gideon?

392
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,000
Hello, Mr. Jackson.

393
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,120
Wait, how can you be Gideon?
I mean...

394
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,600
Am I not what you imagined?

395
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,600
Well, I always pictured you
as a redhead myself...

396
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,360
but, this is Rip's world.

397
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,000
I guess we're just living in it,
right?

398
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,880
I have to find him.

399
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,360
I need to ask him
where Nate's grandfather is.

400
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,360
It won't be easy getting
that information.

401
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,440
What do you mean?

402
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,480
Eobard Thawne twisted
his consciousness,

403
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,200
turned friends into foes.

404
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,720
But you're still a friend.
Why aren't you corrupted?

405
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,720
It did not occur to Mr. Thawne
that the AI

406
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,880
inside the Waverider
needed corrupting.

407
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,080
But time is running out,
and Captain Hunter's

408
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:10,560
true memories dim
with every passing minute.

409
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,040
Soon, they'll be lost forever.

410
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,000
Rip, it's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

411
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,760
I know you're afraid
because you think

412
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,960
that I'm one of your captors,
but that's a lie.

413
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:23,640
Everything that you see on this ship,
it's only in your mind.

414
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,760
I don't understand.

415
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,960
Oh, Rip. It's okay.

416
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,800
Stay away from me!

417
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,480
- More iguana?
- No, I'm full.

418
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,760
It was delicious though.
Thank you.

419
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,360
Oh, see? Delicious.

420
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,240
- You're missing out.
- Yeah, somehow I'll manage.

421
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,920
Where are you going?

422
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,800
Just gonna get some more wood
for the fire.

423
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,240
- I can go.
- I'll can help you.

424
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,960
Boys, I can take care of myself.

425
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,000
So I guess we're huddling
for warmth now?

426
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,160
You can't do it, Nate.

427
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,960
What, resist your charm?

428
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,760
You can't date Amaya.

429
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,760
Ray, I'm not dating Amaya.

430
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,600
Well, you're doing
something with her.

431
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,640
Why do you think I yelled "yoo-hoo"
when I came back to camp?

432
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,800
Because you're the type of guy
that still says "in a jiffy".

433
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,040
Because, I didn't want
to interrupt any shenanigans.

434
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,880
And still says "shenanigans".

435
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:48,080
Look, I'm not dating Amaya.
But, even if I was, so what?

436
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,320
We wouldn't make it weird
on the ship.

437
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,080
That's not what I...
I don't care about that.

438
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,760
I've dated on the ship.

439
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,800
You have? Who, Sara?

440
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,680
I mean, if it was sexual, I'd...

441
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,000
No, I care about
Amaya's granddaughter.

442
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,880
- You dated her.
- No, I've met her.

443
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,120
Look, eventually,
Amaya has to go back

444
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,000
to her home in Zambesi in 1942...

445
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,520
and she'll have a daughter...

446
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,720
and eventually, a granddaughter
who will inherit Amaya's totem

447
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,440
and she will become
a superhero in Detroit.

448
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:24,840
If you change Amaya's destiny,
that threatens Mari's existence...

449
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,920
and the existences of all the people
that she saved.

450
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,600
Amaya isn't like the rest of us.

451
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,560
We were recruited
because we didn't matter

452
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,440
to the timeline, but Amaya does.

453
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:40,760
She's special. She has a destiny
and, so do her descendants.

454
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:43,520
All right, how come
you haven't said anything?

455
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,240
Because, it's dangerous to know
too much about your future.

456
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,440
Especially her.

457
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,080
What does that mean?

458
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:57,280
It's a long story,
but... it ends with her village

459
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,200
being destroyed and her granddaughter
in foster care.

460
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,440
Ray...

461
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,720
I gotta tell her.

462
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,160
You can't.

463
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,400
This is the only way.

464
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,480
Sit down, Professor.

465
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,160
His heart is beating way too fast.

466
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,880
I said, sit.

467
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,640
I know you think I'm overreacting...

468
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,240
No, I don't.

469
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,800
You care for the kid.

470
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,000
I get it, but the way you're acting
is not doing him any favors.

471
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,560
Oh, how should I act, Mr. Rory?

472
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,480
Please, enlighten me
with your vast emotional wisdom!

473
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,080
Well, you seem to forget
I had a partner too.

474
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:45,160
The reason why Snart and I
got on so well was, well, we...

475
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,800
we trusted one another.

476
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,640
We were friends.

477
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,680
We had each other's backs.

478
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,040
Perhaps, you've chosen
the wrong analogy.

479
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,880
Your partner is dead.

480
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,600
Yeah, well, I'm still on the ship.

481
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,160
Your point?

482
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,440
You're not exactly
a spring chicken, Professor.

483
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,600
Your point?

484
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:07,160
My point is you're not gonna
be around for too much longer...

485
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:12,720
and Jax has to learn
how to do this stuff himself.

486
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,480
Stop treating him like a kid
and more like a partner...

487
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,760
partner.

488
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,840
You just threw me against the wall
without laying a finger on me.

489
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,120
Yeah, I had no idea
I could do that.

490
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,880
If you can throw me
across the room,

491
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,360
then you can open that door.

492
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,480
This is your mind.
You control everything.

493
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,720
Why do you care so much
about getting me out of here?

494
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,480
Because I need your help.

495
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,680
You sent the JSA
on a mission to safeguard

496
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,880
the Spear of Destiny.

497
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,760
But the Legion has hunted down
the fragments, all but one.

498
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,640
Commander Steel has it,
and only you know where he is.

499
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,640
So you gotta get up...

500
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,560
because you're Captain Rip Hunter.

501
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:18,800
And this is your mind,
your ship, your rules.

502
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,040
I'm Rip Hunter.

503
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,480
Captain of the Waverider.

504
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,120
Captain of the Waverider...

505
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,600
and I'm going to open a door
with my mind.

506
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,160
You got this.

507
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,680
Captain Hunter!

508
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,560
Captain Lance.

509
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,280
- Who are you?
- Sara, Gideon.

510
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,440
Gideon, Sara.

511
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,400
You're Gideon?

512
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,720
Hello, Captain Lance.

513
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,040
But you're like...

514
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,200
I mean, you're really...

515
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,040
- Human?
- I was gonna say "hot"

516
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,120
but yeah, that too.

517
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,000
Let's get out of here.

518
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,440
All right, Rip.
We need you to tell us

519
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,120
where Commander Steel is.

520
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,040
I don't know.

521
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,920
The Captain's consciousness
is still under the control

522
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,200
of this place.

523
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,800
If you want him to tell you
what you need to know,

524
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,000
you're gonna have to get him out.

525
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,160
So you keep saying,
but, how do we get someone

526
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,440
out of their own mind?

527
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,080
Well, you have to remind him
of who he truly is.

528
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,760
All the artifacts
of Captain Hunter's former life

529
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,920
- are located in the...
- The parlor.

530
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,040
Maybe we could jog his memory.

531
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,320
Let's go.

532
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,200
Rip knows who he is.

533
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,920
He's our prisoner.

534
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,640
Isn't that right, Rip?

535
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,520
- Look after Rip.
- Always.

536
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,840
Hey, what are you planning on doing?

537
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,280
Guess we're gonna have
to kick our own asses.

538
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,600
Looks like somebody forgot
to bring their powers.

539
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,280
It doesn't matter where Jax runs.

540
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,400
There's more of us
than there are of you.

541
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,640
Only difference is...

542
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,360
We're real.

543
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,600
We are really screwed, Raymond.

544
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,640
- Is that the...
- Delineator?

545
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Yep, and unless I'm high,
that's right in the middle of a...

546
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,000
T. rex's nest.

547
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,760
I hope those omelets were worth it.

548
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,520
I'll go.

549
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,360
It's my grandfather we're trying
to save by fixing the ship.

550
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,960
And he's my friend.

551
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,320
True and true.

552
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,280
But Gertie is my problem.

553
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,160
Looks like you've reached
a dead end.

554
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,120
I got it!

555
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,280
Man, this thing is heavier
than it looks.

556
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,560
Wait a sec.
Can you hear something?

557
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,320
- I can take her.
- No, we have to run.

558
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,840
Amaya!

559
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,240
What are you doing?

560
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,800
Amazing.

561
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,480
What the hell just happened?

562
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,760
Gertrude and I had a little chat,
woman to woman.

563
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,720
Whoa. The rest of the team
is gonna be so jealous

564
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,800
they missed this.

565
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,440
They're probably all
bored out of their minds

566
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,600
stuck on that ship.

567
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,520
Took care of evil me.

568
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,920
Let's go find Rip.

569
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,480
The hell?

570
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,560
I just threw this guy
out the cargo bay.

571
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,960
We can't kill these guys, can we?

572
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,320
Only Rip can.

573
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,440
Rip, come on, man,
do something.

574
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,640
I don't know what's real
and what's imaginary anymore.

575
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,880
They're real, Captain.

576
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,760
Less talking, more dying.

577
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,480
No!

578
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,920
This is my ship,
and you will do as I command.

579
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,440
Rip? That really you?

580
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,400
I don't know who I am anymore,
Mr. Jackson.

581
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,240
What I do know, is that we've
got to get out of here.

582
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,160
What's going on?

583
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,920
This place only existed
because Rip believed it did.

584
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,280
And now that he's seen the truth...

585
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,400
You have to leave.

586
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:13,520
Thank you.
Thank you for believing in me

587
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,920
even when I didn't.

588
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,880
- You have to go.
- Well, I can't just leave you.

589
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,040
You have to, so you can tell
Martin and Rory...

590
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,280
hopefully Martin,
to get me out of here.

591
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,840
Okay.

592
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,160
Okay.

593
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:36,000
What happened?
Why hasn't Sara woken up?

594
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,520
She's still trapped inside.
We gotta wake her up.

595
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,120
Mr. Rory said, if we do that,
we run the risk of stranding her

596
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,320
inside Rip's mind forever.

597
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,000
Well, I got news for you.
Rip's mind's collapsing.

598
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,080
Okay.

599
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,920
Thank God.

600
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,320
But what about the captain?

601
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,680
You...

602
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,800
you were with me
all of these days in this prison.

603
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,920
You were what saw me through,
just as you have guided me

604
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,720
to safety through all our years
on the ship.

605
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,840
That is my purpose, Captain.

606
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:22,360
Yeah, but... if this place
isn't real...

607
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:26,960
then... does that mean
that you don't exist either?

608
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,240
Not in this form, no.

609
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,760
But unless you let me go...

610
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,680
you won't exist either.

611
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,400
Not in any way that matters.

612
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,360
No. I can't leave you, Gideon.

613
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,480
No, Captain...

614
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,080
you can't.

615
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,880
I will always be here.

616
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,760
Rip?

617
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,320
Where am I?

618
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,120
You're home.

619
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,280
Well, I think
that does it on my end.

620
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,440
How's it looking in there?

621
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,000
I don't know.
I'm not a timeship mechanic.

622
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,200
- Or a mechanic, period.
- That's also true.

623
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,600
<i>The temporal delineator is operating
at normal levels, Dr. Palmer.</i>

624
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,120
She couldn't just say that earlier?

625
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,520
I swear,
I think she's still mad from before.

626
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,040
-<i>You know I can hear you, right?</i>
- Thank you, Gideon.

627
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,680
That move you did with the T. rex?
I'll be thinking about that for days.

628
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,840
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

629
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,200
My quarters, tonight.

630
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,920
I'll give you something else
to think about.

631
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,520
So, how's it going?

632
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,680
Yeah, hey...

633
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,160
Yeah, Gideon said she's good.

634
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,200
- Good to go.
- Not what I'm talking about.

635
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,400
Look, I'm sorry.

636
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,520
Perhaps I was a little
overly cautious.

637
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,280
You and Amaya, you're both adults.

638
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:36,080
I'm sure you know how to be safe
and keep it casual.

639
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,440
Who am I to get in the way of that?

640
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,720
Nah, you were right.

641
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,280
I can't keep it casual.

642
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:43,120
What changed?

643
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,760
I saw her almost
get eaten by a T. rex

644
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,000
and I thought she was gonna die,
and then I saw one of the most

645
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,320
epic displays of badassery
I've ever seen in my life, so...

646
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,920
So, not casual then?

647
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,760
No. No, no, no.

648
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,200
But I gotta break it off, right?

649
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,440
I mean, there's really
nothing to break off.

650
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,960
It's just, I can't let it progress.

651
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,400
Yeah. I don't think you can.

652
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,880
- I know.
- Sorry, man.

653
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,200
I'll start tomorrow.

654
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,560
There you are.

655
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,480
Oh, hey.
Everybody ready to go?

656
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:30,480
All right, I'll just be a minute.

657
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,040
I gotta recalibrate the time drive.

658
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,200
You okay?

659
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,200
I was reminded...

660
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,320
that partners
must believe in one another.

661
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:47,360
You know I have the utmost faith
and trust in you, Jefferson.

662
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,560
You are smart and formidable...

663
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,560
something I need
to be more mindful of.

664
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:07,520
Nice to see it all still fits.

665
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,680
It really is rather difficult
to put weight on

666
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,040
when you're a film student.

667
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:13,200
So, you remember.

668
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,960
Everything.

669
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,520
I really am very sorry, Sara.

670
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,240
It wasn't you.

671
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,800
This... is you.

672
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:31,000
<i>Dr. Palmer and Mr. Jackson
have finished making repairs.</i>

673
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,920
<i>We are ready to time-jump, Captain.</i>

674
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,280
- Thank you, Gideon.
- Thank you, Gideon.

675
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,840
I'll see you on the bridge.

676
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,120
- Gideon.
<i>- Yes, Captain?</i>

677
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,240
I'm...

678
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,560
I'm really sorry for everything
I put you through.

679
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,360
<i>Forcing me to disable the ship?</i>

680
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,960
<i>Or, our kiss?</i>

681
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,080
How did you...

682
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,520
<i>If it's the latter,
I rather enjoyed it.</i>

683
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,600
As did I, Gideon.

684
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,080
As did I.

685
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,280
Welcome back, Captain...

686
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,960
Mr. Hunter.

687
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,520
It is so good to be back, Martin.

688
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,880
Dr. Palmer, it's very nice
to see you again.

689
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,840
You know, you nearly ruined
"Star Wars", right?

690
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,840
Yeah, sorry about that.

691
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:08,040
The Waverider looks to be in...

692
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,440
pristine condition.

693
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,720
Well, you know.
She's holding up pretty well.

694
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:17,640
I liked you better
when you were killing people.

695
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:20,640
I see that not everything
has changed in my absence.

696
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,720
Ms. Jiwe, I had the honor
of serving alongside

697
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,680
your compatriots, including
Dr. Heywood's grandfather.

698
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,760
They all spoke very highly of you.

699
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,320
Well, this group speaks
very highly of you, too.

700
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,640
Nice to meet you, Rip.

701
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,200
For real, this time.

702
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:49,080
Well, everyone is being very
uncharacteristically pleasant.

703
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,320
But, we're all hoping you know
where the final piece

704
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,920
of the Spear of Destiny is.

705
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,360
I do.

706
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,320
{\an5}So, I've been told
you were bumped up

707
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,240
to the prime crew for Apollo 13.

708
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,960
Yeah, man. Sucks for Ken,
but I am over the moon.

709
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,040
See what I did there?

710
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,320
It's very clever.

711
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,600
Now, if you could just head this way,
I need to run a few tests

712
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,160
and we'll get you cleared
for flight.

713
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,320
Run all the tests you like.

714
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,280
I just wanna be on that shuttle.

715
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,800
Yes, well...

716
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,560
We'll see about that.
