00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:37,153
[Shifu] Have you finished sight-seeing?

323
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:39,488
Sorry, I should have
come to see you first.

324
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,532
-[Shifu] My patience is wearing thin.
-Oh.

325
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,410
Well, I mean,
it's not like you were going anywhere.

326
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,162
-[Shifu] Would you turn around?
-Sure.

327
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:50,040
Hey. How's it going? How do you get five--
Master Shifu!

328
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,126
-Oh!
-[moaning emanating from urn]

329
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:54,712
Someone broke that.

330
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,882
But I'm gonna fix it. I'll-- I'll--
Do you have some...

331
00:20:58,132 --> 00:20:59,675
-...glue?
-[moaning emanating from urn]

332
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:03,345
[Po] Ow! Ow. Oh, I have a splinter.

333
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:06,348
So, you're the legendary
Dragon Warrior, hmm?

334
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,351
-Uh, I guess so.
-Wrong!

335
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:12,813
You are not the Dragon Warrior.
You will never be the Dragon Warrior

336
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:16,609
until you have learned
the secret of the Dragon Scroll.

337
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:18,736
Whoa.

338
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,988
So, um, how does this work?

339
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:24,033
Do you have a ladder,
or a trampoline, or...

340
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,869
[chuckles] You think it's that easy?

341
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:29,371
That I'm just gonna hand you the secret

342
00:21:29,497 --> 00:21:31,415
-to limitless power?
-No, I--

343
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,668
One must first master
the highest level of kung fu.

344
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:38,631
And that is clearly impossible
if that one is someone like you.

345
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:41,509
-Someone like me?
-Yes, look at you!

346
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:44,553
-This fat butt! Flabby arms!
-Ouch!

347
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:46,764
Those are sensitive in the flabby parts.

348
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:49,725
-And this ridiculous belly.
-Hey!

349
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:53,395
And utter disregard for personal hygiene.

350
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:55,648
Now, wait a minute. That's uncalled for.

351
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:58,234
Don't stand that close.
I can smell your breath.

352
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,944
Listen, Oogway said I was the--

353
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:02,905
The Wuxi Finger Hold.
Not the Wuxi Finger Hold!

354
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,533
Oh, you know this hold?

355
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:08,369
Developed by Master Wuxi
in the Third Dynasty. Yes.

356
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:11,288
Oh. Then you know what happens
when I flex my pinky.

357
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:14,542
-[gasping] No, no, no!
-You know the hardest part of this?

358
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:18,629
The hardest part
is cleaning up afterwards. [chuckles]

359
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,881
Okay, okay, take it easy.

360
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,342
Now listen closely, panda.

361
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:26,554
Oogway may have picked you,
but when I'm through with you,

362
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:29,640
I promise you,
you're going to wish he hadn't!

363
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:31,559
Are we clear?

364
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:34,979
Yeah, we're clear.
We're clear. We're so clear.

365
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:38,274
Good. [chuckles]
I can't wait to get started.

366
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:42,778
[Furious Five grunting]

367
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:53,080
[grunting continues]

368
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,721
[grunting]

369
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:11,015
[grunts]

370
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:18,147
Ow! Ooh! Ow!

371
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,274
-Let's begin.
-Wait, wait, wait.

372
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:22,151
W-- What?

373
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:26,071
-Now?
-Yes, now.

374
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:28,490
Unless you think
the great Oogway was wrong,

375
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:30,367
and you are not the Dragon Warrior.

376
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,286
Oh, okay, well...

377
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:35,915
I-- I don't know if I can--
I can do all of those moves.

378
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:38,959
Well, if we don't try,
we'll never know, will we?

379
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,420
Yeah, it's just,
maybe we can find something

380
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:44,256
-more suited to my level.
-And what level is that?

381
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,718
Well, you know,
I... I'm not a master, but, uh,

382
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:50,346
let's just start at zero. Level zero.

383
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:54,642
[chuckles] No.
There is no such thing as level zero.

384
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,353
-Hey, maybe I can start with that.
-That?

385
00:23:57,811 --> 00:23:59,521
We use that for training children.

386
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,024
And for propping the door open
when it's hot.

387
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,068
But if you insist...

388
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,278
[Po] Whoa. The Furious Five!

389
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:09,198
You're so much bigger
than your action figures.

390
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,700
Except for you, Mantis.
You're about the same.

391
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:17,039
Go ahead, panda.
Show us what you can do.

392
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:22,753
Are they gonna watch? Or should I wait
till they get back to work?

393
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,923
-Hit it.
-Okay, yeah. I mean, I just ate.

394
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,258
Um... So I'm still digesting.

395
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:31,929
So my kung fu might not
be as good as... later on.

396
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:33,180
Just hit it.

397
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:36,934
All right. What you got?

398
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,520
You got nothing,
'cause I got it right here.

399
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:42,481
You picking on my friends?
Get ready to feel the thunder.

400
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:45,192
I'm coming out with crazy feet.
What you gonna do about crazy feet?

401
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:48,112
Come on. I'm a blur.
You've never seen bear style.

402
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:50,030
You've only seen praying mantis.

403
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:52,533
Or monkey style. [screeching]

404
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:54,952
Or I could come at you snickety-snake.

405
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:58,831
-Would you hit it!
-All right. All right.

406
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:08,507
Why don't you try again? A little harder.

407
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,343
How's that--

408
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,640
Whoa!

409
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:20,227
-[all gasp]
-[moaning]

410
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,480
Ow, that hurts!

411
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,401
[screams in slow-motion]

412
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,573
This will be easier than I thought.

413
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,159
I'm feeling a little nauseous!

414
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:38,704
Ow! Ow! Ow! Oh. Ow, those are hard!

415
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,873
[moans]

416
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:42,958
My tenders.

417
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,044
[groans]

418
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,682
Uh-oh. [yells]

419
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:07,232
[groaning]

420
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:12,654
How did I do?

421
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,866
There is now a level zero.

422
00:26:17,201 --> 00:26:19,578
-[Mantis] There's no words.
-[Crane] No denying that.

423
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,955
[Viper] I don't understand
What was Master Oogway thinking?

424
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:24,333
The poor guy's
just gonna get himself killed.

425
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,835
[mocking] He is so mighty!

426
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:31,590
The Dragon Warrior
fell out of the sky on a ball of fire!

427
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:35,177
-When he walks, the very ground shakes!
-[all laugh]

428
00:26:35,636 --> 00:26:37,387
One would think that Master Oogway

429
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:39,973
would choose someone
who actually knew kung fu.

430
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:42,059
Yeah, or could at least touch his toes.

431
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,728
-Or even see his toes.
-[laughter]

432
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:55,114
[straining]

433
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:56,782
[Po] Ow!

434
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:13,048
-Okay.
-[floor squeaking]

435
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,139
Great.

436
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:27,146
[wood breaking]

437
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,906
-Oh, hey. Hi. You're up?
-Am now.

438
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:39,992
I was just, uh...

439
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,660
Someday, huh?

440
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,580
That kung fu stuff is hard work, right?

441
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:46,123
-Are your biceps sore?
-Um...

442
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:51,795
I've had a long, a--
and rather disappointing day, so, uh...

443
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:56,175
Yeah, I should probably get to sleep now.

444
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,802
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.
-OK, thanks.

445
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,388
It's just...
Man, I'm such a big fan!

446
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,308
You guys were amazing
at the Battle of Weeping River.

447
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:08,020
Outnumbered a thousand to one,
but you didn't stop. You just--

448
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:10,022
-[grunts]
-[wall rips]

449
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:11,899
Oh. Sorry about that.

450
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,611
Look, you don't belong here.

451
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,282
I know. I know. You're right.

452
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:24,203
I don't have-- I just...
My whole life I dreamed of...

453
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:26,705
No, no, no.
I-- I meant you don't belong here.

454
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,333
I mean, in this room. This is my room.

455
00:28:30,876 --> 00:28:32,336
Property of Crane.

456
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,546
Oh. Okay. Right, right.

457
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:37,382
[clears throat] So, yeah,
you want to get to sleep.

458
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,926
-Yeah.
-I'm keeping you up.

459
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:40,969
We got big things tomorrow.

460
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:45,432
All right. You're awesome.
Last thing I'm gonna say. Okay, Bye-bye.

461
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,019
[sighs]

462
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:50,812
What was that?

463
00:28:50,938 --> 00:28:52,105
I didn't say anything.

464
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:55,275
Okay, all right. Good night. Sleep well.

465
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:00,197
That seemed a little bit awkward.

466
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:04,785
Master Tigress!
Didn't mean to wake you. Just--

467
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,914
-You don't belong here.
-Yeah, yeah. Of course, this is your room.

468
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:12,459
I mean, you don't belong
in the Jade Palace.

469
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:16,922
You're a disgrace to kung fu,
and if you have any respect for who we are

470
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:18,423
and what we do,

471
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,968
you will be gone by morning.

472
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:27,641
Big fan!

473
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:39,486
I see you have found
the Sacred Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.

474
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,654
Oh!

475
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:43,615
Is that what this is? I am so sorry.

476
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:46,159
I thought it was just
a regular peach tree.

477
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:51,081
I understand. You eat when you are upset.

478
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:55,210
Upset? I'm not upset.
W-- W-- What makes you think I'm upset?

479
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:58,755
So, why are you so upset?

480
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:05,762
[exhales] I probably sucked more today

481
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,848
than anyone in the history of kung fu.

482
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:11,143
In the history of China.
In the history of sucking!

483
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:13,645
-Probably.
-And the Five!

484
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,523
Man, you should've seen them!
They totally hate me.

485
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,066
Totally.

486
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:21,361
How is Shifu ever going
to turn me into the Dragon Warrior?

487
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,574
I mean, I'm not like the Five.

488
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:29,244
I've got no claws, no wings, no venom.

489
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:32,497
Even Mantis has those... thingies.

490
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:36,835
Maybe I should just quit
and go back to making noodles.

491
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,507
Quit, don't quit.

492
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:45,302
Noodles, don't noodles.

493
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:50,932
You are too concerned
with what was and what will be.

494
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:52,976
There's a saying...

495
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,896
"Yesterday is history,

496
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:58,357
tomorrow is a mystery,

497
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,109
but today is a gift."

498
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,945
"That is why it is called the present."

499
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,924
[breathing deeply]

500
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,303
[grunting]

501
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:36,103
-Oh, no!
-What's happening?

502
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,689
[man] To your battle stations! Go! Go! Go!

503
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:42,776
[snarling]

504
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:51,118
Fire crossbows! Fire!

505
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:54,955
Fire!

506
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:05,507
Tai Lung is free! I must warn Shifu.

507
00:32:05,674 --> 00:32:07,592
You're not going anywhere
and neither is he!

508
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,344
-Let go of me!
-Bring it up!

509
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,765
Wait! Bring it back!

510
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:28,655
[neck cracking]

511
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:35,871
-He's coming this way!
-He won't get far. Archers!

512
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:52,971
[both laughing]

513
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:08,028
-[indistinct shouting]
-[snarling]

514
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:39,017

515
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,810
[both growling]

516
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:42,312
[shrieks]

517
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,942
We're dead. So very, very dead.

518
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:49,903
[laughs] Not yet we're not. Now!

519
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,879
-[roars]
-[all gasp]

520
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:13,093
[laughing]

521
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:40,579
-Can we run now?
-Yes.

522
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:46,084
[all screaming]

523
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:51,923
[groans]

524
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:58,638
[gulps]

525
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:03,059
[exhales deeply] I'm glad Shifu sent you.

526
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:07,272
I was beginning to think
I'd been forgotten.

527
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,649
Fly back there and tell them...

528
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:13,737
the real Dragon Warrior is coming home.

529
00:35:15,655 --> 00:35:19,409
[shuddering, panting]

530
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,000
[all] Good morning, Master!

531
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:31,379
Panda! Panda!

532
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:32,797
Wake up!

533
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:37,594
[chortling] He's quit.

534
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,849
What do we do now, Master,
with the panda gone?

535
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:44,559
Who will be the Dragon Warrior?

536
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:47,979
All we can do is resume our
training and trust that in time,

537
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,732
the true Dragon Warrior will be revealed.

538
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:53,693
What are you doing here?

539
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:56,571
Hi! Good morning, Master!

540
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:58,281
I thought I'd warm up a little.

541
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,659
[straining]

542
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:01,743
You're stuck.

543
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:03,870
Stuck? Nah. What? Stuck?

544
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:07,957
[scoffs] Nah.
This is one of my-- Yeah, I'm stuck.

545
00:36:08,083 --> 00:36:09,959
-Help him.
-Oh, dear.

546
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,213
[Po] Yeah, maybe on three. One, two...

547
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:15,840
three.

548
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,302
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

549
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,471
-No, really, I appreciate--
-Ever.

550
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:26,810
You actually thought you could learn
to do a full split in one night?

551
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,896
It takes years
to develop one's flexibility!

552
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:33,692
And years longer to apply it in combat!

553
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:35,735
Ooh...

554
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:44,911
Put that down!

555
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:49,541
The only souvenirs we collect here
are bloody knuckles and broken bones.

556
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,460
Yeah! [chuckling] Excellent.

557
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,462
Let's get started.

558
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:58,758
-[Viper] Are you ready?
-I was born re--

559
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,802
Ow! [grunts]

560
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:03,763
I'm sorry, brother.
I thought you said you were ready.

561
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,641
That was awesome! Let's go again!

562
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,857
Ow! Oh!

563
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,817
[shrieks]

564
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,610
[groans]

565
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:29,247
[grunting] Ow!

566
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,124
[Shifu chuckles]

567
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:36,379
I've been taking it easy on you, panda.
But no more.

568
00:37:36,546 --> 00:37:38,506
Your next opponent will be me.

569
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,467
All right! Yeah, let's go!

570
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,596
Step forth.

571
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:48,725
The true path to victory
is to find your opponent's weakness

572
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,643
and make him suffer for it.

573
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:51,936
Oh, yeah!

574
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,898
To take his strength
and use it against him...

575
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:57,192
until he finally falls...

576
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:01,112
-or quits.
-[nasally] But a real warrior never quits.

577
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:04,199
Don't worry, Master. I will never quit!

578
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,826
[screams]

579
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,665
Ow! Ow!

580
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,545
If he's smart,
he won't come back up those steps.

581
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:19,297
But he will.

582
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,758
-He's not gonna quit, is he?
-[Po grunting]

583
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,010
He's not going to quit bouncing,
I'll tell you that.

584
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,720
[laughs]

585
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:29,182
[Po] Oh! Ooh! Ah! Ooh!

586
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:34,729
[exclaiming]

587
00:38:36,481 --> 00:38:39,526
Ow! I thought you said acupuncture
would make me feel better.

588
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:43,279
Trust me, it will. It's just not easy
finding the right nerve points

589
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:44,823
-under all this, um--
-Fat?

590
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:47,283
Fur. I was going to say fur.

591
00:38:47,492 --> 00:38:49,536
-Sure you were.
-Who am I to judge a warrior

592
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:52,247
based on his size? I mean, look at me.

593
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,500
-I'm over here.
-Ah-ha!

594
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,877
Maybe you should look at this again.

595
00:38:58,211 --> 00:39:00,713
Oh, okay.

596
00:39:01,214 --> 00:39:03,216
[Po] Ow! [laughing]

597
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:05,093
<i>Stop it. Stop!</i>

598
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:06,344
-Ow!
-[gasps]

599
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:09,472
I know Master Shifu
is trying to inspire me and all,

600
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:13,393
but if I didn't know any better,
I'd say he was trying to get rid of me.

601
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:16,104
[laughing]

602
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:20,441
I know he can seem kind of heartless...

603
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,361
but, you know, he wasn't always like that.

604
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:26,114
According to legend, there was once a time

605
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:29,284
<i>when Master Shifu actually used to smile.</i>

606
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,160
-[Po] <i>No!</i>
-[Mantis] Yes.

607
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,829
[Viper] <i>But that was before.</i>

608
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,289
Before what?

609
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:36,040
Before Tai Lung.

610
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:38,751
[Crane] <i>Yeah, we're not really supposed</i>
<i>to talk about him.</i>

611
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:42,046
Well, if he's going to stay here,
he should know.

612
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,007
Guys, guys, I know about Tai Lung.

613
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:45,258
He was a student.

614
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:49,470
The first ever to master
the Thousand Scrolls of kung fu.

615
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:53,558
And then he turned bad,
and now he's in jail and...

616
00:39:54,267 --> 00:39:55,727
He wasn't just a student.

617
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,650
<i>Shifu found him as a cub...</i>

618
00:40:04,861 --> 00:40:07,030
<i>...and he raised him as his son.</i>

619
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:12,952
<i>And when the boy showed talent in</i>
<i>kung fu...</i>

620
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:15,496
<i>Shifu trained him.</i>

621
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:20,501
<i>He believed in him.</i>
<i>He told him he was destined for greatness.</i>

622
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:24,422
<i>It was never enough for Tai Lung.</i>

623
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,509
<i>He wanted the Dragon Scroll.</i>

624
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:32,513
<i>But Oogway saw darkness</i>
<i>in his heart and refused.</i>

625
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:36,768
<i>Outraged, Tai Lung</i>
<i>laid waste to the valley.</i>

626
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,648
<i>He tried to take the scroll by force.</i>

627
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:45,735
<i>And Shifu had to destroy</i>
<i>what he had created.</i>

628
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:49,113
<i>But how could he?</i>

629
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:02,794
[panting]

630
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:07,298
[Tigress] <i>Shifu loved Tai Lung</i>
<i>like he had never loved anyone before.</i>

631
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,266
<i>Or since.</i>

632
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:28,861
And now he has a chance
to make things right.

633
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,030
To train the true Dragon Warrior.

634
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,408
And he's stuck with you.

635
00:41:34,367 --> 00:41:38,079
A big fat panda who treats it like a joke.

636
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:41,290
-Oh, that is it!
-Wait! My fault!

637
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:43,251
I accidentally tweaked his facial nerve.

638
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,588
And may have also stopped his heart.

639
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,052
[Shifu] Inner peace.

640
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,014
Inner peace.

641
00:41:59,726 --> 00:42:01,561
Inner-- In-- In...

642
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:04,022
In-- In-- Inner peace.

643
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:11,779
Would whoever is making
that flapping sound quiet down?

644
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:16,743
Inner--

645
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:19,203
-[squawks]
-Hmm...

646
00:42:21,456 --> 00:42:23,332
Oh, Zeng.

647
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:24,709
Excellent.

648
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:27,420
I could use some good news right now.

649
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,050
Uh...

650
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:36,721
-Master! Master!
-[Oogway] Hmm?

651
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:41,059
I-- I-- I have-- It's--
It's very bad news.

652
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:43,227
Ah, Shifu.

653
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:46,981
There is just news.
There is no good or bad.

654
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:50,485
Master, your vision.
Your vision was right.

655
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:54,113
Tai Lung has broken out of prison.
He's on his way.

656
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:57,450
That is bad news...

657
00:42:58,743 --> 00:43:02,622
if you do not believe
that the Dragon Warrior can stop him.

658
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:07,376
The panda? Master, that panda
is not the Dragon Warrior.

659
00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:10,463
He wasn't meant to be here!
It was an accident.

660
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,965
There are no accidents.

661
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:16,761
[sighing heavily] Yes, I know.
You've said that already.

662
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:21,224
-Twice.
-Well, that was no accident, either.

663
00:43:21,933 --> 00:43:24,102
-Thrice.
-My old friend,

664
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:28,856
the panda will never fulfill
his destiny, nor you yours,

665
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:32,485
until you let go
of the illusion of control.

666
00:43:32,944 --> 00:43:33,945
Illusion?

667
00:43:34,487 --> 00:43:36,989
Yes. Look at this tree, Shifu.

668
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,201
I cannot make it blossom when it suits me,

669
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:43,663
nor make it bear fruit before its time.

670
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:46,082
But there are things we can control.

671
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,461
I can control
when the fruit will fall. [grunts]

672
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:51,629
[chuckles]

673
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:52,713
And I can control...

674
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,006
[grunts]

675
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:55,925
...where to plant the seed.

676
00:43:56,968 --> 00:43:59,137
That is no illusion, Master.

677
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,390
Ah, yes.

678
00:44:02,974 --> 00:44:05,226
But no matter what you do

679
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:07,645
that seed will grow to be a peach tree.

680
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:10,731
You may wish for an apple or an orange,

681
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:12,900
but you will get a peach.

682
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:16,028
But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!

683
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:18,948
Maybe it can.

684
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:22,160
If you are willing to guide it.

685
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:23,828
To nurture it.

686
00:44:24,453 --> 00:44:25,705
To believe in it.

687
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,249
But how? How?

688
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:30,084
I need your help, Master.

689
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,838
No, you just need to believe.

690
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:36,549
Promise me, Shifu.

691
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:39,886
Promise me you will believe.

692
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,806
I... I will try.

693
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:45,975
Good.

694
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:50,188
My time has come.

695
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:56,277
You must continue your journey without me.

696
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,697
What-- What-- What-- What are you-- Wait!

697
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:02,158
Master!

698
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:04,702
You can't leave me!

699
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:10,791
You must believe.

700
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:13,544
Master!

701
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:46,786
[Po] <i>Yeah, so I'm like,</i>
<i>"Fine, you may be a wolf,</i>

702
00:45:47,036 --> 00:45:49,747
you may be the scariest bandit
in Haijin Province...

703
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,458
-but you're a lousy tipper."
-Really?

704
00:45:53,042 --> 00:45:55,211
So, how did you get out of there alive?

705
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:58,339
I mean-- I mean,
I didn't actually say that...

706
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:01,801
but I thought it, in-- in my mind.

707
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:04,845
If he could read my mind,
he'd have been, like, "What?"

708
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,431
Order up! Hope you like it.

709
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:11,769
This is really good!

710
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,689
No, come on. You should try
my dad's Secret Ingredient Soup.

711
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:17,233
He actually knows the secret ingredient.

712
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:19,777
What do you talking about?
This is amazing!

713
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:21,279
[Crane] Wow, you're a good cook.

714
00:46:21,404 --> 00:46:24,490
-[Mantis] I wish my mouth was bigger.
-Tigress, you've got to try this.

715
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:26,659
It is said that the Dragon Warrior

716
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:29,620
can survive for months at a time,
on nothing but the dew

717
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:32,707
of a single ginkgo leaf
and the energy of the universe.

718
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:37,670
I guess my body doesn't know
it's the Dragon Warrior yet.

719
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:43,175
I'm gonna need a lot more than dew
and, uh, universe juice.

720
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:47,888
[all laughing]

721
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:50,808
-What?
-Oh, nothing... Master Shifu.

722
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,977
[all laughing]

723
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:57,106
[imitating Shifu] You'll never be the
Dragon Warrior unless you lose 500 pounds

724
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:58,774
-and brush your teeth!
-[laughter]

725
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:00,526
What is that noise you're making?

726
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:02,278
Laughter? I never heard of it!

727
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:04,864
Work hard, panda, and maybe someday...

728
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:07,325
you will have ears like mine.

729
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:10,995
-That's good.
-[laughter stops]

730
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:14,498
Ears. It's not working for you?
I thought they were pretty good.

731
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:15,833
It's Shifu!

732
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,252
Of course it's Shifu.
What do you think I'm doing?

733
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,797
Ooh! Master Shifu!

734
00:47:23,049 --> 00:47:25,092
[laughter]

735
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:26,802
[Shifu] You think this is funny?

736
00:47:27,136 --> 00:47:30,056
Tai Lung has escaped,
and you're acting like children!

737
00:47:30,222 --> 00:47:32,183
-What?
-He is coming for the Dragon Scroll,

738
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,643
and you are the only one who can stop him.

739
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:39,023
[laughs] And here I am,

740
00:47:39,148 --> 00:47:40,900
saying you got no sense of humor.

741
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:43,319
I'm gonna... stop Tai Lung.

742
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:45,988
What? You're serious? And I have to...

743
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:50,326
M-- Master Oogway will stop him!
He-- He did before.

744
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,370
-He'll do it again.
-Oogway cannot!

745
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:55,664
-Not anymore.
-[all gasping]

746
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:58,918
Our only hope is the Dragon Warrior.

747
00:47:59,085 --> 00:48:00,628
-The panda?
-Yes, the panda!

748
00:48:00,753 --> 00:48:04,382
Master, please! Let us stop Tai Lung.
This is what you've trained us for.

749
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:07,676
No! It is not your destiny
to defeat Tai Lung.

750
00:48:07,802 --> 00:48:08,928
It is his!

751
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,013
Where'd he go?

752
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:14,767
[screaming]

753
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:21,524
You cannot leave!
A real warrior never quits.

754
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:22,900
Watch me.

755
00:48:25,694 --> 00:48:28,364
Come on.
How am I supposed to beat Tai Lung?

756
00:48:28,781 --> 00:48:30,491
I can't even beat you to the stairs.

757
00:48:30,825 --> 00:48:33,869
You will beat him
because you are the Dragon Warrior.

758
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:37,832
Ow! You don't believe that.
Oh! You never believed that.

759
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:40,918
From the first moment I got here,
you've been trying to get rid of me.

760
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:42,878
Yes! I was.

761
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:45,714
But now I ask you to trust in your master

762
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,592
as I have come to trust in mine.

763
00:48:48,717 --> 00:48:53,139
[grunts] You're not my master.
And I'm not the Dragon Warrior.

764
00:48:53,389 --> 00:48:55,015
Then why didn't you quit?

765
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,768
You knew I was trying to get rid of you,
yet you stayed.

766
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:59,353
Yeah, I stayed.

767
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:03,399
I stayed because every time
you threw a brick at my head

768
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:08,154
or said I smelled, it hurt...
but it could never hurt more

769
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:11,073
than it did every day
of my life just being me.

770
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:16,328
I stayed because I thought,
if anyone could change me...

771
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:19,832
could make me, not me...

772
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:21,417
it was you!

773
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:24,253
The greatest kung fu teacher
in all of China!

774
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,338
But I can change you!

775
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:29,091
I can turn you into the Dragon Warrior!

776
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,635
-And I will!
-Come on.

777
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:33,888
Tai Lung is on his way here right now.

778
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:36,265
And even if it takes him
a hundred years to get here,

779
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:41,770
how are you gonna change this
into the Dragon Warrior, huh?

780
00:49:44,607 --> 00:49:45,774
How?

781
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,235
How?

782
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:52,656
-How?!
-I don't know!

783
00:50:01,207 --> 00:50:02,249
I don't know.

784
00:50:05,294 --> 00:50:07,171
[dramatic music playing]

785
00:50:10,049 --> 00:50:11,383
That's what I thought.

786
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:51,966
This is what you trained me for.

787
00:50:59,807 --> 00:51:00,808
[Viper] Tigress!

788
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:06,313
Don't try and stop me.

789
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:10,943
[Viper] We're not trying to stop you.

790
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:13,195
-What?
-We're coming with you!

791
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:22,538
[dramatic music concludes]

792
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,795

[Po burps]

00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:30,230
What? I eat when I'm upset, okay?

797
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:32,941
Oh. No need to explain.

798
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:34,818
I just thought you might be Monkey.

799
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,904
He hides his almond cookies
on the top shelf.

Don't tell Monkey.

-Look at you.
-Yeah, I know, I disgust you.

804
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:06,141
No, no! I mean, how did you get up there?

805
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:07,434
I don't know, I...

806
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:11,522
I guess... I don't know.
I was getting a cookie.

807
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:14,149
And yet you are ten feet off the ground.

808
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:16,860
And have done a perfect spilt.

809

No, this? This is just a...

810

Come with me.

[Po panting heavily]

815
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:41,468
I know you're trying to be
all mystical and kung fuey...

816
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:44,638
but could you at least
tell me where we're going?

817
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:49,017
[panting heavily]

818
00:53:54,857 --> 00:53:56,984
You dragged me...

819
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:58,527
all the way out here...

820
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:00,237
for a bath?

821
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:08,996
Panda, we do not wash our pits
in the Pool of Sacred Tears.

00:54:09,288 --> 00:54:11,415
Huh? The Pool of...

823
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:13,959
This is where Oogway
unraveled the mysteries

824

of harmony and focus.

825
00:54:16,462 --> 00:54:18,380
This is the birthplace...

826
00:54:19,047 --> 00:54:20,090
of kung fu.

827
00:54:23,135 --> 00:54:24,511
[gasps]

-Yeah!

Then I am your master!

Okay! [sniffs]

-Don't cry.
-Okay. [sniffles]

832
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:54,208
When you focus on kung fu,

833
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:57,711
when you concentrate... you stink.

834
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:00,047
But, perhaps, that is my fault.

835
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:02,925
I cannot train you
the way I have trained the Five.

836
00:55:03,759 --> 00:55:06,470
I now see that the way
to get through to you...

837
00:55:06,929 --> 00:55:07,930
is with this.

838

Oh, great, 'cause I am hungry.

No, they're breathing.
They're asleep? No, their eyes are open.

906
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:44,678
-Ow!
-He's too fast! Sorry, Po.

907
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:50,225
-I thought we could stop him.
-He could have killed you.

908
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:51,559
Why didn't he?

909
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:54,688
So you could come back here
and strike fear into our hearts.

910
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:59,359
-But it won't work.
-Uh, it might. I mean, a little.

911
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:01,611
I'm-- I'm pretty scared.

912
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:03,113
You can defeat him, panda!

913
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:06,199
Are you kidding? If they can't--

914
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:09,202
They're five masters. I'm just one me.

915
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:12,622
But you will have the one thing
that no one else does.

916
01:03:18,253 --> 01:03:19,838
You really believe I'm ready?

917
01:03:20,714 --> 01:03:21,631
You are.

922
01:04:21,149 --> 01:04:22,150
No one knows.

923

But legend says you will be able
to hear a butterfly's wing beat.

in motion around you.

-Focus.
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

Read it, Po, and fulfill your destiny.

932

Read it and become...

-Here, look.
-No!

Blank. I don't...

946
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:37,934
I don't understand.

947
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:41,855
Okay. So, like,

948
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:45,400
Oogway was just
a crazy old turtle after all.

949
01:05:45,525 --> 01:05:48,069
No. Oogway was wiser than us all.

950
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:51,781
Oh, come on! Face it,
he picked me by accident.

951
01:05:52,282 --> 01:05:54,325
Of course I'm not the Dragon Warrior.

952
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:56,536
Who am I kidding?

953
01:05:57,495 --> 01:05:59,164
[Tigress] But who will stop Tai Lung?

954
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:01,666
[Crane] He'll destroy
everything and everyone.

955
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:03,418
No.

956
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:05,545
Evacuate the valley.

957
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,090
You must protect the villagers
from Tai Lung's rage.

958
01:06:09,424 --> 01:06:11,593
-What about you, Master?
-I will fight him.

959
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:14,095
-What?
-I can hold him off long enough

960
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:18,516
-for everyone to escape.
-But Shifu, he'll kill you.

961
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:21,519
Then I will finally have paid
for my mistake.

962
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:23,980
Listen to me, all of you.

963
01:06:24,439 --> 01:06:27,859
It is time for you
to continue your journey without me.

964
01:06:28,276 --> 01:06:30,528
I am very proud to have been your master.

965
01:06:52,467 --> 01:06:54,177
We've got to get them out safely.

966
01:06:54,427 --> 01:06:56,679
Come, little one. Let's find your mama.

967
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:58,806
Viper, gather the southern farmers.

968
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:01,643
Mantis, the north. Crane, light the way.

969
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:23,540
[mocking] Look, it's the Dragon Warrior.

970
01:07:29,254 --> 01:07:30,588
[exhales deeply]

971
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:34,217
Hey, Dad.

972
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:36,052
Po!

973
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:43,851
Good to have you back, son.

974
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:47,897
Good to be back.

975
01:07:48,398 --> 01:07:49,566
Let's go, Po.

976
01:07:52,819 --> 01:07:55,280
So for our next shop, it's time to face it

977
01:07:55,405 --> 01:07:58,950
the future of noodles
is dice-cut vegetables,

978
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:00,493
no longer slices.

979
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:04,706
Also, I was thinking, maybe this time

980
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:08,293
we'll have a kitchen
you can actually stand up in.

981
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:10,545
You like that?

982
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:20,805
Po, I-- I-- I'm sorry
if things didn't work out.

983
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:24,100
It just wasn't meant to be.

984
01:08:28,396 --> 01:08:30,106
Po, forget everything else.

985
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:32,609
Your destiny still awaits.

986
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:34,569
We are noodle folk.

987
01:08:34,736 --> 01:08:37,488
Broth runs deep through our veins.

988
01:08:38,031 --> 01:08:39,240
I don't know, Dad.

989
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:43,828
Honestly, sometimes I can't
believe I'm actually your son.

990
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:48,416
[chuckles] Po...

991
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:52,629
I think it's time I told you something
I should have told you...

992
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:54,797
a long time ago.

993
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:57,008
Okay.

994
01:08:58,468 --> 01:09:02,305
The secret ingredient
of my Secret Ingredient Soup.

995
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:04,098
Oh.

996
01:09:05,308 --> 01:09:08,603
Come-- come here.
The secret ingredient is...

997
01:09:10,146 --> 01:09:12,357
-nothing.
-Huh?

998
01:09:12,482 --> 01:09:16,944
You heard me. Nothing!
There is no secret ingredient!

999
01:09:17,528 --> 01:09:20,448
Wait, wait.
It's just plain old noodle soup?

1000
01:09:20,657 --> 01:09:23,076
You don't add some kind of
special sauce or something?

1001
01:09:23,201 --> 01:09:24,452
Don't have to.

1002
01:09:24,619 --> 01:09:28,206
To make something special,
you just have to believe it's special.

1003
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:40,927
There is no secret ingredient.

1004
01:09:47,975 --> 01:09:49,394
[thunderclap]

1005
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:51,896
[thunder rumbling]

1006
01:09:58,403 --> 01:10:00,279
[thunderclap]

1007
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:06,244
I have come home, Master.

1008
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:09,872
This is no longer your home.
And I am no longer your master.

1009
01:10:10,373 --> 01:10:12,959
Oh, yes. You have a new favorite.

1010
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,546
So, where is this Po?

1011
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:19,590
[chuckles] Did I scare him off?

1012
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:22,009
This battle is between you and me.

1013
01:10:23,511 --> 01:10:26,556
So, that is how it's going to be.

1014
01:10:26,848 --> 01:10:28,516
That is how it must be.

1015
01:10:29,183 --> 01:10:31,894
[growling]

1016
01:10:32,145 --> 01:10:33,813
[shouting]

1017
01:10:43,448 --> 01:10:47,785
I rotted in jail for 20 years
because of your weakness!

1018
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:49,829
Obeying your master is not weakness!

1019
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:52,665
You knew I was the Dragon Warrior.

1020
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:55,084
<i>You always knew.</i>

1021
01:10:55,710 --> 01:11:00,173
<i>But when Oogway said otherwise,</i>
<i>what did you do?</i>

1022
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:03,509
<i>What did you do?</i>

1023
01:11:06,429 --> 01:11:07,388
Nothing!

1024
01:11:07,472 --> 01:11:09,348
You were not meant
to be the Dragon Warrior!

1025
01:11:09,474 --> 01:11:10,600
That was not my fault!

1026
01:11:10,725 --> 01:11:12,393
Not your fault?

1027
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,395
Who filled my head with dreams?

1028
01:11:14,729 --> 01:11:17,190
Who drove me to train
until my bones cracked?!

1029
01:11:17,315 --> 01:11:20,067
Who denied me my destiny?

1030
01:11:29,076 --> 01:11:31,662
-It was never my decision to make!
-[snarls]

1031
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:38,336
It is now.

1032
01:11:44,091 --> 01:11:47,053
Give me the scroll!

1033
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:48,429
I would rather die.

1034
01:11:52,058 --> 01:11:54,352
[straining, grunts]

[snarls]

1037
01:12:38,729 --> 01:12:42,108
All I ever did, I did to make you proud!

1038
01:12:42,316 --> 01:12:44,735
Tell me how proud you are, Shifu!

1039
01:12:45,528 --> 01:12:47,363
-Tell me!
-[grunting]

1040
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:48,906
Tell me!

1041
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:02,461
I have-- I have always been proud of you.

1042
01:13:04,005 --> 01:13:08,467
From the first moment,
I've been... proud of you.

1043
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:11,387
And it was my pride...

1044
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:13,598
that blinded me.

1045
01:13:14,390 --> 01:13:17,435
I loved you too much
to see what you were becoming.

1046
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,146
What I...

1047
01:13:21,272 --> 01:13:22,773
was turning you into.

1048
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:25,234
I'm s...

1049
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:26,986
I'm sorry.

1050
01:13:34,285 --> 01:13:37,788
[snarling]
I don't want your apology.

1051
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:39,957
I want my scroll!

1052
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:45,630
What? Where is it?

1053
01:13:46,714 --> 01:13:50,885
Dragon Warrior has taken scroll
halfway across China by now.

1054
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:55,222
You will never see that scroll, Tai Lung.

1055
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:56,641
Never.

1056
01:13:57,683 --> 01:13:58,768
[straining] Never.

1057
01:13:59,644 --> 01:14:00,728

Who are you?

1061
01:14:12,031 --> 01:14:15,952
Buddy, I am the Dragon Warrior.

Him? He's a panda.

1065
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:27,505
You're a panda. What are you
gonna do, big guy? Sit on me?

1066
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:30,466
Don't tempt me. No.

1067
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:32,802
I'm gonna use this.

1068
01:14:34,011 --> 01:14:35,638
You want it? Come and get it.

1069

The power of the Dragon Scroll is mine!

It's nothing!

1091

It's okay.
I didn't get it the first time, either.

What?
