1
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,570
Easy, boy.

2
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,030
( Gasps

3
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:14,480
What do you expect?
They're savages.

4
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,850
One lot steals a goat
from another lot,

5
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,880
before you know it they're ripping
each other to pieces.

6
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,080
I've never seen wildlings
do a thing like this.

7
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,420
I never seen a thing like this,
not ever in my life.

8
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,320
How close did you get?

9
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,290
- Close as any man would.
- We should head back to the wall.

10
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,460
Do the dead frighten you?

11
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,930
Our orders were
to track the wildlings.

12
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:39,800
We tracked them.
They won't trouble us no more.

13
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,510
You don't think
he'll ask us how they died?

14
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,440
Get back on your horse.

15
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,320
Whatever did it to them
could do it to us.

16
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,320
They even killed
the children.

17
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:58,420
It's a good thing
we're not children.

18
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,530
You want to run away south,
run away.

19
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,460
Of course they will
behead you as a deserter,

20
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,870
if I don't
catch you first.

21
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,400
Get back on your horse.

22
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,410
I won't say it again.

23
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,510
Your dead men seem
to have moved camp.

24
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,070
They were here.

25
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,710
See where they went.

26
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,360
What is it?

27
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,870
It's...

28
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:23,110
♪ Game of Thrones 1x01 ♪
Winter Is Coming
Original Air Date on April 17, 2011

30
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:52,380
Go on, father's watching.

31
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,310
And your mother.

32
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,690
Fine work as always.
Well done.

33
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,560
Thank you.

34
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:11,560
I love the detail that you've managed
to get in these corners.

35
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,530
Quite beautiful.

36
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,600
The stitching...

37
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,430
And which one of you
was a marksman at 10?

38
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,960
Keep practicing, Bran.

39
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:46,070
Go on.

40
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,970
Don't think
too much, Bran.

41
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,510
Relax your bow arm.

42
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,120
Quick, Bran!
Faster.

43
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,690
Lord Stark!

44
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,730
My lady.

45
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,930
A guardsman just
rode in from the hills.

46
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,970
They've captured a deserter
from The Night's Watch.

47
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:25,640
Get the lads to saddle
their horses.

48
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,710
Do you have to?

49
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,070
He swore an oath, Cat.

50
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,080
The law is law,
my lady.

51
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,080
Tell Bran he's coming too.

52
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,550
Ned.

53
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:40,920
10 is too young
to see such things.

54
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,720
He won't be a boy forever.

55
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,960
And winter is coming.

56
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:08,950
Lad, go run back
and get the rest.

57
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,390
White Walkers.

58
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:18,160
I saw the White Walkers.

59
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:20,120
White Walkers.

60
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,230
The White Walkers,
I saw them.

61
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,900
I know I broke my oath.

62
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:37,010
And I know
I'm a deserter.

63
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,740
I should have gone back to the wall
and warned them, but--

64
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,950
I saw what I saw.

65
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,980
I saw the White Walkers.

66
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,720
People need to know.

67
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,720
If you can get word
to my family...

68
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,160
Tell them I'm no coward.

69
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,330
Tell them I'm sorry.

70
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:15,910
Forgive me, Lord.

71
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,620
In the name of Robert
of the House Baratheon,

72
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,550
- the first of his name...
- Don't look away.

73
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,330
...King of the Andals
and the first men...

74
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:27,470
Father will know if you do.

75
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:31,030
...Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and protector of the realm,

76
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,800
I, Eddard of the House Stark,

77
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:36,700
Lord of Winterfell
and warden of the north,

78
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,270
sentence you to die.

79
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,190
You did well.

80
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:25,320
You understand
why I did it?

81
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,320
Jon said
he was a deserter.

82
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:30,020
But do you understand
why i had to kill him?

83
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,820
"Our way is the old way"?

84
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,390
The man who passes
the sentence

85
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,160
should swing the sword.

86
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:40,560
Is it true he saw
the White Walkers?

87
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:45,440
The White Walkers have been
gone for thousands of years.

88
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:48,270
So he was lying?

89
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:55,010
A madman sees what he sees.

90
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,940
What is it?

91
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:27,380
Mountain lion?

92
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,680
There are no Mountain lions
in these woods.

93
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,670
It's a freak!

94
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:22,310
It's a direwolf.

95
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,880
Tough old beast.

96
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,090
There are no direwolves
south of the wall.

97
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,250
Now there are five.

98
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,960
You want to hold it?

99
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,660
Where will they go?

100
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,500
Their mother's dead.

101
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,170
They don't belong
down here.

102
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,140
Better
a quick death.

103
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:56,040
They won't last
without their mother.

104
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:58,240
- Right. Give it here.
- No!

105
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,010
Put away your blade.

106
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,180
I take orders
from your father, not you.

107
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:05,010
- Please, father!
- I'm sorry, Bran.

108
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,920
Lord Stark?

109
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,420
There are
five pups...

110
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,750
one for each
of the Stark children.

111
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,590
The direwolf is the sigil of your House.

112
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,160
They were meant
to have them.

113
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,540
You will train them
yourselves.

114
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:28,540
You will
feed them yourselves.

115
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:31,610
And if they die,
you will bury them yourselves.

116
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,950
What about you?

117
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,450
I'm not a Stark.

118
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,690
Get on.

119
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:58,170
What is it?

120
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:05,940
The runt of the litter--
that one's yours, snow.

121
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,240
As your brother,
I feel it's my duty to warn you:

122
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,540
You worry too much.

123
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:15,910
- It's starting to show.
- And you never worry about anything.

124
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:21,180
When we were seven
and you jumped off
the cliffs at Casterly Rock,

125
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,550
100-foot drop into the water,

126
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,650
and you were never afraid.

127
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:28,390
There was nothing to be afraid of
until you told father.

128
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,290
"We're lannisters.

129
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,790
Lannisters
don't act like fools."

130
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,730
What if Jon Arryn
told someone?

131
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,060
But who would he tell?

132
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,230
- My husband.
- If he told the King, both our heads

133
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:44,470
would be skewered
on the city gates by now.

134
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,010
Whatever Jon Arryn
knew or didn't know, it died with him.

135
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,840
And Robert will choose a new
Hand of the King-- someone to do his job

136
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,780
while he's off fucking boars
and hunting whores--

137
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,780
or is it
the other way around?

138
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,220
And life will go on.

139
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,820
You should be
The Hand of the King.

140
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,690
That's an honor
I can do without.

141
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,860
Their days are too long,

142
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:11,160
their lives are too short.

143
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:51,140
All these years

144
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,840
and I still feel
like an outsider

145
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:55,110
when I come here.

146
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,680
You have five
northern children.

147
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:00,950
You're not an outsider.

148
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,920
I wonder
if the old gods agree.

149
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,920
It's your gods
with all the rules.

150
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,000
I am so sorry, my love.

151
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,940
- Tell me.
- There was a raven from King's Landing.

152
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,510
Jon Arryn is dead.

153
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:27,210
A fever took him.

154
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,280
I know he was like
a father to you.

155
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,350
- Your sister, the boy?
- They both have their health,

156
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:40,560
gods be good.

157
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,200
The raven
brought more news...

158
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,540
The King rides
for Winterfell...

159
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:58,270
with the Queen

160
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,440
and all the rest
of them.

161
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,750
If he's coming
this far north...

162
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,320
There's only
one thing he's after.

163
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:10,390
You can always say no, Ned.

164
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,830
We'll need plenty of candles
for Lord Tyrion's chamber.

165
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,800
I'm told he reads
all night.

166
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,740
I'm told he drinks
all night.

167
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:30,080
How much could he possibly drink?
A man of his...

168
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,880
Stature?

169
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:34,580
We've brought up
eight barrels of ale from the cellar.

170
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:37,150
- Perhaps we'll find out.
- In any case,

171
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:39,850
candles.

172
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,030
Why is your mother so dead set
on us getting pretty for the King?

173
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,900
It's for the Queen, I bet.
I hear she's a sleek bit of mink.

174
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:52,030
I hear the prince
is a right royal prick.

175
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,100
Think of all those
southern girls he gets to stab

176
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,700
with his right
royal prick.

177
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,610
Go on, Tommy,
shear him good.

178
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,110
He's never met a girl he likes better
than his own hair.

179
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:41,880
Gods, but they grow fast.

180
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:45,720
Brandon!

181
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:49,090
I saw the king.
He's got hundreds of people.

182
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,330
How many times
have I told you no climbing?

183
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,230
But he's coming right now--
down our road.

184
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:04,640
I want you
to promise me,

185
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:06,440
no more climbing.

186
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,440
I promise.

187
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:17,680
- Do you know what?
- What?

188
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:20,020
You always look
at your feet before you lie.

189
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:26,060
Run and find your father.
Tell him the King is close.

190
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:13,880
Where's Arya?
Sansa, where's your sister?

191
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:25,620
- Hey hey hey hey.
- Ohh.

192
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,960
What are you doing
with that on?

193
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,900
Go on.

194
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,000
Move!

195
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:00,010
Your Grace.

196
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,120
You've got fat.

197
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,830
- Cat!
- Your Grace.

198
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,110
Nine years-- why haven't I seen you?
Where the hell have you been?

199
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,040
Guarding the north
for you, your Grace.

200
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,850
Winterfell is yours.

201
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,320
- Where's the imp?
- Will you shut up?

202
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:40,050
Who have we here?

203
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:41,860
You must be Robb.

204
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:48,160
My, you're
a pretty one.

205
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,170
Your name is?

206
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,770
Arya.

207
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,840
Oh, show us
your muscles.

208
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:59,110
You'll be a soldier.

209
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:04,510
That's Jaime Lannister,
the Queen's twin brother.

210
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,750
Would you please shut up?

211
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:18,390
My Queen.

212
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,060
My Queen.

213
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:22,300
Take me to your crypt.
I want to pay my respects.

214
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:24,570
We've been riding
for a month, my love.

215
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,300
Surely the dead can wait.

216
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,310
Ned.

217
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,280
Where's the imp?

218
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:44,690
Where is our brother?

219
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,920
Go and find
the little beast.

220
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:51,460
Tell me about
Jon Arryn.

221
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:54,130
One minute
he was fine and then...

222
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,100
Burned right through him,
whatever it was.

223
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,240
I loved that man.

224
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,600
We both did.

225
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,870
He never had to teach
you much, but me?

226
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,140
You remember me at 16?

227
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,110
All I wanted to do

228
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:11,780
was crack skulls
and fuck girls.

229
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:14,720
- He showed me what was what.
- Aye.

230
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:18,090
Don't look at me like that.
It's not his fault I didn't listen.

231
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:24,360
I need you, Ned--

232
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:28,300
down at King's Landing, not up here
where you're no damn use to anybody.

233
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:32,700
Lord Eddard Stark,

234
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:35,340
I would name you
the Hand of the King.

235
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,840
I'm not worthy
of the honor.

236
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,620
I'm not trying to honor you.
I'm trying to get you to run my kingdom

237
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:49,190
while I eat, drink and whore
my way to an early grave.

238
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,320
Damn it, Ned, stand up.

239
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,760
You helped me win
the iron throne,

240
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,890
now help me
keep the damn thing.

241
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,930
We were meant
to rule together.

242
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,030
If your sister had lived,
we'd have been bound by blood.

243
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:06,440
Well, it's not too late.

244
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,770
I have a son,
you have a daughter.

245
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,340
We'll join our Houses.

246
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:41,310
-
It is true what they say
about the northern girls.

247
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,780
Did you hear the King's
in Winterfell?

248
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,750
I did hear
something about that.

249
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:56,050
And the Queen
and her twin brother.

250
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:59,220
They say that he is the most
handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.

251
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,390
And the other brother?

252
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:04,460
- The Queen has two brothers?
- There's the pretty one,

253
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,500
and there's
the clever one.

254
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:12,400
Mmm, I hear they
call him the imp.

255
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,500
I hear he hates
that nickname.

256
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,770
Oh?
I hear he's
more than earned it.

257
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:20,580
I hear he's a drunken
little lecher,

258
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:23,050
prone to all manner
of perversions.

259
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,980
Clever girl.

260
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:28,620
We've been expecting you,
Lord Tyrion.

261
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,820
Have you?

262
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,720
- Oh!
- Already?

263
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:38,600
The gods gave me
one blessing.

264
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,000
- Don't get up.
- My Lord.

265
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,370
Should I explain to you
the meaning of a closed door

266
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:52,140
- in a whorehouse, brother?
- You have much to teach me, no doubt,

267
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:55,810
but our sister craves
your attention.

268
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,950
She has odd cravings,
our sister.

269
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,120
A family trait.

270
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:03,020
Now the Starks are
feasting us at sundown.

271
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,260
Don't leave me alone
with these people.

272
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:07,660
I'm sorry, I've begun
the feast a bit early.

273
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:11,060
And this is the first
of many courses.

274
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,300
I thought
you might say that.

275
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:15,730
But since
we're short on time...

276
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:17,670
Come on, girls.

277
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:25,040
See you at sundown.

278
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,640
Close the door!

279
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:42,790
Did you have to bury her
in a place like this?

280
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:46,830
She should be
on a hill somewhere

281
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:49,470
with the sun
and the clouds above her.

282
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,470
She was my sister.

283
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:54,270
This is where
she belongs.

284
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,840
She belonged with me.

285
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:05,490
In my dreams,
I kill him every night.

286
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,490
It's done, your Grace.

287
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,160
The Targaryens are gone.

288
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,460
Not all of them.

289
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,340
Daenerys!

290
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,280
Daenerys.

291
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:36,350
There's our bride-to-be.

292
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:40,390
Look, a gift
from Illyrio.

293
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:43,220
Touch it.

294
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,460
Go on,
feel the fabric.

295
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,260
Mmm.

296
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:56,230
Isn't he a gracious host?

297
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,440
We've been his guests
for over a year

298
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,440
and he's never
asked us for anything.

299
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,210
Illyrio's no fool.

300
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,580
He knows I won't
forget my friends

301
00:34:06,610 --> 00:34:08,650
when I come
into my throne.

302
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:15,450
You still slouch.

303
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,490
Let them see.

304
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:27,030
You have
a woman's body now.

305
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:47,550
I need you to be
perfect today.

306
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:50,850
Can you do that for me?

307
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,960
You don't want to wake
the dragon, do you?

308
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,000
No.

309
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:10,010
When they write the history
of my reign, sweet sister,

310
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:12,280
they will say
it began today.

311
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,670
It's too hot, my lady.

312
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,660
Where is he?

313
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:03,330
The Dothraki are not known
for their punctuality.

314
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:20,710
Athchomar chomakaan, Khal vezhven.

315
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,680
May I present
my honored guests?

316
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:26,420
Viserys
of House Targaryen,

317
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:28,150
the third of his name,

318
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:31,520
the rightful king of the Andals
and the first men,

319
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:33,290
and his sister

320
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:35,960
Daenerys
of House Targaryen.

321
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:41,330
Do you see
how long his hair is?

322
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:44,070
When Dothraki are
defeated in combat,

323
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:48,040
they cut off their braids
so the whole world can
see their shame.

324
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:52,040
Khal Drogo has
never been defeated.

325
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,050
He's a savage, of course,

326
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,410
but one of the finest
killers alive.

327
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,820
And you will be his Queen.

328
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:03,490
Come forward, my dear.

329
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,230
Where is he going?!

330
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,800
- The ceremony is over.
- But he didn't say anything.

331
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:50,270
- Did he like her?
- Trust me, your Grace,

332
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,800
if he didn't like her,
we'd know.

333
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:58,070
It won't be
long now.

334
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:00,010
Soon you will cross
the Narrow Sea

335
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,480
and take back
your father's throne.

336
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:05,410
The people
drink secret toasts

337
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:07,150
to your health.

338
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,520
They cry out
for their true king.

339
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,990
When will they
be married?

340
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:18,560
Soon.
The Dothraki never stay still for long.

341
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,130
Is it true they lie
with their horses?

342
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:24,230
I wouldn't ask
Khal Drogo.

343
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:26,140
Do you take me
for a fool?

344
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,010
I take you
for a King.

345
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:31,240
Kings lack the caution
of common men.

346
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,640
My apologies if
I've given offense.

347
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:36,050
I know how to play
a man like Drogo.

348
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,980
I give him a Queen
and he gives me an army.

349
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:41,890
I don't want
to be his Queen.

350
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,360
I want to go home.

351
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:50,730
So do I.

352
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:53,900
I want us both
to go home,

353
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,240
but they took it from us.

354
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:58,040
So tell me, sweet sister,

355
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:00,270
how do we go home?

356
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,680
I don't know.

357
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:06,710
We go home with an army.

358
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:11,550
With Khal Drogo's army.

359
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:14,590
I would let
his whole tribe fuck you--

360
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:17,830
all 40,000 men
and their horses too

361
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,730
if that's what it took.

362
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:39,280
Do you think Joffrey
will like me?

363
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,850
What if he thinks
I'm ugly?

364
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,550
Then he is the stupidest prince
that ever lived.

365
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:50,460
He's so handsome.

366
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:53,190
When would we be married?
Soon? Or do we have to wait?

367
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:56,330
Hush now.
Your father hasn't even said yes.

368
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,200
Why would he say no?

369
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:01,500
He'd be the second most powerful man
in the kingdoms.

370
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:04,100
He'd have to leave home.

371
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:07,070
He'd have to leave me.

372
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:10,110
And so would you.

373
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,750
You left your home
to come here.

374
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,580
And I'd be Queen someday.

375
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:18,220
Please make father
say yes!

376
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:20,120
- Sansa--
- Please please!

377
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:23,090
It's the only thing
I ever wanted.

378
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,070
Fill that up!
Boys, Rodrik, come on.

379
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:41,370
Come on!

380
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:02,630
Is he dead yet?

381
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,870
Uncle Benjen.

382
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:13,170
You got bigger.

383
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:17,110
Rode all day.
Didn't want to leave you
alone with the Lannisters.

384
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:19,080
Why aren't you
at the feast?

385
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:22,150
Lady Stark thought
it might insult the royal family

386
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:24,390
to seat a bastard
in their midst.

387
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:27,120
Well, you're always
welcome on the wall.

388
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,360
No bastard was ever
refused a seat there.

389
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:31,090
So take me with you
when you go back.

390
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:34,000
- Jon--
- Father will let me if you ask him.

391
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:36,230
I know he will.

392
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,940
The wall isn't
going anywhere.

393
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:42,300
I'm ready

394
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:43,670
to swear your oath.

395
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:46,410
You don't understand
what you'd be giving up.

396
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,910
We have no families.

397
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:52,280
- None of us will ever father sons--
- I don't care about that!

398
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,950
You might, if you knew
what it meant.

399
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,490
I'd better get inside,

400
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,190
rescue your father
from his guests.

401
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,230
We'll talk later.

402
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:19,870
Your Uncle's in
The Night's Watch.

403
00:42:22,850 --> 00:42:25,180
What are you doing
back there?

404
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:28,380
Preparing for a night
with your family.

405
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:34,960
I've always wanted
to see the wall.

406
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:36,720
You're Tyrion Lannister,

407
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,360
the Queen's brother?

408
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:40,590
My greatest
accomplishment.

409
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:44,400
And you-- you're Ned Stark's
bastard, aren't you?

410
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,040
Did I offend you?
Sorry.

411
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:54,610
You are
the bastard though.

412
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:58,250
Lord Eddard Stark
is my father.

413
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:02,120
And Lady Stark
is not your mother,

414
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:04,420
making you the bastard.

415
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:09,420
Let me give you
some advice, bastard.

416
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:12,390
Never forget
what you are.

417
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:14,360
The rest of the world
will not.

418
00:43:14,390 --> 00:43:16,960
Wear it like armor

419
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:19,530
and it can never
be used to hurt you.

420
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:24,170
What the hell do you know about
being a bastard?

421
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:28,880
All dwarves are bastards
in their father's eyes.

422
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:54,740
You at a feast--
it's like a bear in a trap.

423
00:43:56,570 --> 00:43:58,910
The boy I beheaded--

424
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:01,510
- did you know him?
- Of course I did.

425
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,650
Just a lad.

426
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,410
And he was tough, Ned,

427
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:07,220
a true ranger.

428
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:10,720
Pfft.
He was talking madness.

429
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:14,120
Said the Walkers
slaughtered his friends.

430
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:16,730
The two he was with
are still missing.

431
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:21,560
Hmph.
A wildling ambush.

432
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,230
Maybe.

433
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:26,800
Direwolves
south of the wall,

434
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,340
talk of The Walkers,

435
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:31,970
and my brother might be
the next Hand of the King.

436
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:35,280
Winter is coming.

437
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,680
Winter is coming.

438
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:43,150
- Uncle Benjen.
- Robb boy.

439
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:44,790
- How are you?
- I'm good.

440
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:50,730
Is this your first time
in the north, your Grace?

441
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,900
Yes.
Lovely country.

442
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:01,000
I'm sure it's very grim
after King's Landing.

443
00:45:02,270 --> 00:45:04,380
I remember how scared I was
when Ned brought me

444
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,640
up here
for the first time.

445
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:10,510
Hello, little dove.

446
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,880
But you are a beauty.

447
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,020
- How old are you?
- 13, your Grace.

448
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:18,790
You're tall.
Still growing?

449
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:20,720
I think so, your Grace.

450
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,990
And have you bled yet?

451
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:29,560
No, your Grace.

452
00:45:30,930 --> 00:45:33,100
Your dress,
did you make it?

453
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,740
Such a talent.
You must make something for me.

454
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:42,610
I hear we might share
a grandchild someday.

455
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:44,880
I hear the same.

456
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,980
Your daughter will
do well in the capital.

457
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:50,720
Such a beauty shouldn't stay hidden
up here forever.

458
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:10,110
- Your pardon.
- I hear we might be neighbors soon.

459
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:11,810
- I hope it's true.
- Yes,

460
00:46:11,850 --> 00:46:13,710
the King has honored me
with his offer.

461
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:15,250
I'm sure we'll have
a tournament

462
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,250
to celebrate your new title--
if you accept.

463
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:19,490
It would be good
to have you on the field.

464
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,690
The competition
has become a bit stale.

465
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,460
- I don't fight in tournaments.
- No?

466
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:25,990
Getting
a little old for it?

467
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:29,660
I don't fight
in tournaments

468
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,200
because when I fight
a man for real

469
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:34,470
I don't want him to know
what I can do.

470
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,100
Well said.

471
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:42,070
Arya!

472
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:44,710
It's not funny!

473
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:47,480
She always
does this.

474
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:49,380
This was
my favorite dress.

475
00:46:49,420 --> 00:46:52,680
She always does it
and it's not funny!

476
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,650
Time for bed.

477
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,670
I'm a Northman.

478
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,110
I belong here with you,
not down south

479
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:13,640
in that rats' nest
they call a capital.

480
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,410
I won't let him
take you.

481
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,350
The king
takes what he wants.

482
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,950
That's why he's King.

483
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:28,850
I'll say,
"listen, fat man."

484
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:32,760
"You are not taking
my husband anywhere.

485
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:35,190
He belongs to me now."

486
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,900
How did he get so fat?

487
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:43,770
He only stops eating
when it's time for a drink.

488
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,410
It's Maester Luwin,
my Lord.

489
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:53,310
Send him in.

490
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:57,320
Pardon, my Lord,
my Lady.

491
00:47:57,350 --> 00:48:00,190
A rider in the night...

492
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:02,320
from your sister.

493
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,670
- Stay.
- This was sent from the Eyrie.

494
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:20,910
What's she doing
at the Eyrie?

495
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:23,580
She hasn't been back there
since her wedding.

496
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:34,050
What news?

497
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:38,160
She's fled
the capital.

498
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,960
She says Jon Arryn
was murdered.

499
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,970
By the Lannisters.

500
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:47,770
She says the King
is in danger.

501
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,070
She's fresh widowed, Cat.

502
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:52,110
She doesn't know
what she's saying.

503
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:54,640
Lysa's head would be
on a spike right now

504
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:56,850
if the wrong people
had found that letter.

505
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,580
Do you think she would
risk her life--

506
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:01,250
her son's life--

507
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,750
if she wasn't certain
her husband was murdered?

508
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:13,800
If this news is true

509
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:16,830
and the Lannisters
conspire against the throne,

510
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:20,170
who but you can
protect the King?

511
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:22,410
They murdered
the last Hand.

512
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,810
Now you want Ned
to take the job?

513
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,680
The King rode
for a month

514
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:28,750
to ask for
Lord Stark's help.

515
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:31,420
He's the only one
he trusts.

516
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:36,020
You swore the King
an oath, my Lord.

517
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:39,160
He's spent half his life
fighting Robert's wars.

518
00:49:39,190 --> 00:49:41,690
He owes him nothing.

519
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:46,630
Your father and brother
rode south once

520
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:49,530
on a King's demand.

521
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:53,540
A different time.

522
00:49:54,970 --> 00:49:57,040
A different King.

523
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,800
When do I meet
with the Khal?

524
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:01,710
We need to begin
planning the invasion.

525
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:04,210
If Khal Drogo has
promised you a crown,

526
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,210
- you shall have it.
- When?

527
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,340
When their omens
favor war.

528
00:51:08,380 --> 00:51:11,650
I piss on Dothraki omens.

529
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:14,920
I've waited 17 years
to get my throne back.

530
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:16,250
A Dothraki wedding

531
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:19,820
without at least three deaths
is considered a dull affair.

532
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,530
Jadi,
zhey jorah andahli!

533
00:52:34,570 --> 00:52:36,430
Khal vezhven.

534
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:45,210
A small gift,
for the new Khaleesi--

535
00:52:46,450 --> 00:52:48,750
songs and histories
from the Seven Kingdoms.

536
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:51,850
Thank you, Ser.

537
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:56,190
Are you from my country?

538
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:58,390
Ser Jorah Mormont
of Bear Island.

539
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:01,160
I served your father
for many years.

540
00:53:01,190 --> 00:53:04,290
Gods be good, I hope to always
serve the rightful King.

541
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:30,020
Dragon's eggs, Daenerys,

542
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:33,030
from the Shadow Lands
beyond Asshai.

543
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:36,100
The ages have
turned them to stone,

544
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:38,230
but they will
always be beautiful.

545
00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:42,670
Thank you, Magister.

546
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:52,940
She's beautiful.

547
00:54:57,010 --> 00:54:59,380
Ser Jorah,
I don't know how to say

548
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:01,250
thank you
in Dothraki.

549
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,220
There is no word
for thank you in Dothraki.

550
00:55:25,310 --> 00:55:27,310
Make him happy.

551
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:28,770
No.

552
00:56:31,810 --> 00:56:33,980
Do you know
the common tongue?

553
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:40,450
No.

554
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,890
Is "no" the only word
that you know?

555
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:49,730
No.

556
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:20,260
Rough night, imp?

557
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:22,360
If I get through this
without squirting

558
00:57:22,390 --> 00:57:24,790
from one end or the other
it'll be a miracle.

559
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:27,200
I didn't pick you
for a hunter.

560
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:30,330
The greatest in the land--
my spear never misses.

561
00:57:31,530 --> 00:57:34,100
It's not hunting
if you pay for it.

562
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,510
Are you as good
with a spear as you used to be?

563
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:47,080
No, but I'm still
better than you.

564
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:52,020
I know what I'm
putting you through.

565
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:54,060
Thank you for saying yes.

566
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:57,930
I only ask you
because I need you.

567
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:01,030
You're a loyal friend.

568
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:04,370
You hear me?
A loyal friend.

569
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,200
The last one I've got.

570
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:10,000
- I hope I'll serve you well.
- You will.

571
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:14,480
And I'll make sure you
don't look so fucking grim all the time.

572
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:18,180
Come on, boys,
let's go kill some boar!

573
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:30,290
Come on, you.

574
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:47,140
Stop!

575
00:59:47,170 --> 00:59:49,040
Stop.

576
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,110
Are you completely mad?

577
00:59:56,150 --> 00:59:59,050
- He saw us.
- It's all right, it's all right.

578
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:00,950
- It's all right.
- He saw us!

579
01:00:00,990 --> 01:00:03,250
I heard you
the first time.

580
01:00:07,230 --> 01:00:09,660
Quite the little climber,
aren't you?

581
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:13,730
- How old are you, boy?
- 10.

582
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:15,470
10.

583
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:26,680
The things
I do for love.

584
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:40,040
