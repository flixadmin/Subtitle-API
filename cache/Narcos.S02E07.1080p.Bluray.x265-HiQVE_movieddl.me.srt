- Yes. I'll ask him, all right?

So that's why no one called me?

Because this lab belongs
to the Moncadas. Hmm?

when it was taken back.

I need you to help me find him.

What we want is to exterminate this rat.

Go on, son. Sit down.

So, you're being reassigned,

154

00:12:59,616 --> 00:13:01,118
Yes, sir, Colonel.

159
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:11,169
(Door opens and closes)

160
00:13:21,513 --> 00:13:23,181
How are you, Papa?

161
00:13:27,894 --> 00:13:29,313
And you?

162
00:13:29,438 --> 00:13:33,483
- How long will we be there?
- Not long.

163
00:13:34,985 --> 00:13:38,739
Just long enough for me
to get some things figured out here.

164
00:13:43,785 --> 00:13:46,580
Do you remember when
we went to the United States?

165
00:13:48,457 --> 00:13:50,917
It's going to be an adventure,
just like <i>that.</i>

166
00:13:51,043 --> 00:13:52,669
Do they have Disney World there?

167
00:13:56,048 --> 00:13:58,258
Mmm, I don'<i>t</i> think so.

168
00:14:13,982 --> 00:14:18,236
Listen to your mother
and your grandmother. All right?

169
00:14:21,281 --> 00:14:24,826
I made more than one reservation so
no one would know what flight you're on.

170
00:14:25,702 --> 00:14:28,622
I spoke to Fernando
and he said it's perfectly legal.

171
00:14:28,747 --> 00:14:32,667
You have every right
to leave the country.

172
00:14:32,793 --> 00:14:36,296
- It's like a normal trip.
- A normal trip?

173
00:14:36,922 --> 00:14:38,882
(Sighs)

174
00:14:41,551 --> 00:14:42,969
(Pablo) Hmm...

175
00:14:43,887 --> 00:14:47,974
Confess. Do you regret it?

176
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,394
Marrying me, or what?

177
00:14:51,353 --> 00:14:52,729
Not for a second.

178
00:15:04,991 --> 00:15:06,993
They may separate us...

179
00:15:09,204 --> 00:15:12,541
<i>...but</i> they'll never be able
to destroy us.

180
00:15:21,633 --> 00:15:22,926
Go.

181
00:15:33,812 --> 00:15:36,898
The little bunny. The little bunny.

182
00:15:37,023 --> 00:15:39,192
I'll take care of him, all right?

183
00:15:40,026 --> 00:15:41,486
Give me a kiss.

184
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,169
(Engine starts)

185
00:16:30,035 --> 00:16:32,078
(Sighs)

186
00:16:34,331 --> 00:16:39,085
(Steve) 'Pablo was right. The government
couldn'<i>t</i> stop his family from leaving.

187
00:16:39,711 --> 00:16:43,965
'But if you remember, he had some
bad history with Avianca Airlines.

188
00:16:46,718 --> 00:16:49,095
'And they made sure as shit
that everybody knew

189
00:16:49,221 --> 00:16:51,681
'the Escobars were trying
to fly the coop.'

190
00:16:54,267 --> 00:16:58,772
(In English) What we know is that
Escobar bought tickets for his family

191
00:16:58,897 --> 00:17:02,275
on eight different outgoing flights
from Bogotá.

192
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,946
Destinations ranging
from Barcelona to Toronto.

193
00:17:06,071 --> 00:17:08,532
Mr President, we need
to prevent that from happening.

194
00:17:08,657 --> 00:17:12,244
We need to keep the family in play.
If they're allowed to leave Colombia,

195
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:14,246
we're gonna lose leverage
in the hunt for Escobar.

196
00:17:14,371 --> 00:17:17,749
Legally, there's no way we can stop them
from flying out of the country.

197
00:17:17,874 --> 00:17:19,251
By applying pressure behind the scenes,

198
00:17:19,376 --> 00:17:21,461
we can prevent the family
from being accepted upon arrival.

199
00:17:21,586 --> 00:17:26,091
And if they're kept in Colombia,
he's gonna be worried about their safety.

200
00:17:26,216 --> 00:17:32,305
He'll be more likely to make phone
contact, more likely <i>to...</i> make mistakes.

201
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:36,726
Because they're more likely
to become victims of Los Pepes.

202
00:17:42,357 --> 00:17:46,695
Mr President, if the family gets safe
haven, there's no telling what comes next.

203
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:50,949
Maybe Escobar surrenders,
maybe he goes to war.

204
00:17:52,033 --> 00:17:55,829
The family is leverage.
We have to use <i>it.</i>

205
00:18:05,672 --> 00:18:06,715
I agree.

206
00:18:09,551 --> 00:18:13,930
I want one of your people with them
giving us updates, running interference,

207
00:18:14,055 --> 00:18:17,100
and have them find out
where they're going, and stick with them.

- Yes, ma'am.

00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,841
Who was that?

217
00:18:49,966 --> 00:18:51,259
Messina.

218
00:18:53,762 --> 00:18:56,389
- Where you going?
- Going out.

219
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,476
- With your passport?
- Yep.

220

- Yep.

- Uh, I'd like to get some tickets, please.
- For which flight, sir?

223
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,702
Let's see. Madrid, London...

224
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:34,469
It's Murphy. Get me Messina.

225
00:19:34,594 --> 00:19:38,098
- 'Messina.'
- Hey, it's me. It's the Frankfurt flight.

226
00:19:38,223 --> 00:19:40,475
'Germany. Shit!'

227
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,937
Yes, Mr Foreign Minister, but I'm not
talking about some Turkish date farmer

228
00:19:44,062 --> 00:19:47,774
Iooking to drive a taxi in Berlin.
I'm talking about Pablo Escobar's family.

00:19:48,441 --> 00:19:49,943
(Sighs)

230
00:19:50,068 --> 00:19:53,655
No.
No, they haven'<i>t</i> committed any crimes.

He said you have some
technical background.

I took a couple
of engineering classes, sir.

And I built a ham in my parents' house.

Great. What do you know about RDF?

245
00:20:55,925 --> 00:20:57,343
The basic concept, sir.

246

The basic concept.

247
00:21:04,017 --> 00:21:05,143
All right.

248

What do you expect?

Hey! What the fuck is wrong with you?
Why are you not working?

are on the plane, boss.'

You tell us.
Should we come home or...?

'No. Stay put. We're not done yet.'

Figure out...
what time it is in Germany.

Came in about an hour ago.

Credit card belonging to Fernando Duque.
Used twice, restaurants.

Here, here, a couple streets over.

281

Check this out.
Ran him through the CNP database.

282
00:23:59,233 --> 00:24:02,028
A complaint got filed this morning.
Your boy's wanted.

283
00:24:02,153 --> 00:24:05,406
- For what?
- Kidnapping and car theft.

284
00:24:05,531 --> 00:24:08,701
Filed by his ex-wife. It's a blue Volvo.

285
00:24:09,953 --> 00:24:13,039
He's running. And he's taking his kid.

286
00:24:13,164 --> 00:24:14,916
He's 14 years old. Fuck.

- 'Peña?'
- Not yet.

- Messina.
- (Javier in English) 'Hey, boss.'

294
00:24:58,751 --> 00:25:02,672
I think Fernando Duque's on the run.
He's got his kid with him.

295
00:25:02,797 --> 00:25:05,675
If he's that scared, maybe he's willing
to drop privilege and cooperate.

296
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,011
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. I...

297
00:25:09,095 --> 00:25:11,139
I might have an idea
where he's holed up.

298
00:25:11,264 --> 00:25:14,308
If he comes through for us, you think
we can get him out of the country?

299
00:25:14,434 --> 00:25:17,729
- 'If he'll cooperate, yes. Look into <i>it.'</i>
- You got <i>it.</i>

300
00:25:17,854 --> 00:25:19,439
- 'And Peña.'
- Yeah?

301
00:25:19,564 --> 00:25:21,107
How did all this come up?

302
00:25:22,942 --> 00:25:26,446
My Cl knows a girl he sees.
Kind of fell into my lap.

303
00:25:26,571 --> 00:25:30,158
- 'Mmm-hmm. Get on <i>it.'</i>
- Yeah, boss.

304
00:25:33,703 --> 00:25:35,580
(Trujillo in Spanish)
What's up, Peña?

305
00:25:36,456 --> 00:25:38,082
Are we getting a beer or what?

306
00:25:40,334 --> 00:25:41,836
Another day, brother.

307
00:25:43,421 --> 00:25:44,756
See you tomorrow.

308
00:25:44,881 --> 00:25:45,965

No, no, no.
What are you doing, Simon?

312
00:26:00,688 --> 00:26:04,108
Leave it where it is.
I'm listening to the news.

313
00:26:05,318 --> 00:26:07,403
What are we doing here?

314
00:26:07,528 --> 00:26:09,989
I told you. We're going on a trip.

315
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:12,533
And what's happening?
Where's my mum?

316
00:26:13,785 --> 00:26:16,996
Simon... calm down.
I already spoke to your mother.

317
00:26:17,121 --> 00:26:19,457
You got yourself into trouble, didn'<i>t</i> you?

318
00:26:21,292 --> 00:26:23,044
It's because you work for Pablo Escobar.

319
00:26:25,546 --> 00:26:27,173
That's why this is happening.

320
00:26:32,095 --> 00:26:33,471
You're his lawyer.

321
00:26:36,349 --> 00:26:38,184
What are we going to do now?

322
00:26:40,186 --> 00:26:42,563
I have a plan. Calm down.

323
00:26:43,439 --> 00:26:47,777
You don't have a plan, Dad.
You're a son of a bitch. A fucking thief.

324
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:52,198
Did you say "son of a bitch"? "Thief"?

325
00:26:53,241 --> 00:26:57,036
I'm a lawyer. I'm a good lawyer.

326
00:26:58,412 --> 00:27:02,375
All of the money this family has,
we have because I've been a good lawyer.

327
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,545
- I do my job!
- I want to call my mum.

328
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:07,713
You want to call your mum?

329
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:11,217
Do you want to call your mum,
or do you want to behave like a man?

330
00:27:11,342 --> 00:27:15,054
Are you going to be a pussy
and call your mum? That's a great idea.

331
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:18,641
Let's call her so she can tell you where
all the money for your toys came from.

332
00:27:18,766 --> 00:27:22,478
Your room full of toys.
Where do you think it came from?

333
00:27:23,312 --> 00:27:26,649
Hmm? You didn't complain
during the Christmases or the birthdays

334
00:27:26,774 --> 00:27:28,985
or when I bought you a motorcycle.

335
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:32,697
But now you're complaining.
Very well. Very well. It's over.

336
00:27:33,823 --> 00:27:37,535
It's over! Now that they're going
to kill me, it's over.

337
00:27:46,502 --> 00:27:48,713
(Simon sniffles)

338
00:27:48,838 --> 00:27:51,299
I'm sorry... Simon.

339
00:27:53,342 --> 00:27:55,261
I didn'<i>t</i> mean to say <i>that.</i>

340
00:27:55,386 --> 00:27:56,596
Forgive me.

341
00:27:57,889 --> 00:28:00,850
Everything will be all right.
Forgive me.

342
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:13,529
(Air hissing)

343
00:28:17,241 --> 00:28:19,160
Was it a heart attack or what?

344
00:28:19,285 --> 00:28:20,745
(Ricardo) You fainted, Pablo.

345
00:28:24,624 --> 00:28:26,792
How many of those are you taking?

346
00:28:28,836 --> 00:28:31,547
I've had a terrible headache.

347
00:28:31,672 --> 00:28:34,425
- Those aren't any good, Pablo.
- (Removes cuff)

348
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:37,094
You shouldn'<i>t</i> put so much shit
in your body.

349
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:44,602
You're better off... taking these drops.
They're homeopathic.

350
00:28:44,727 --> 00:28:48,022
Three drops under your tongue
in the morning and two at night.

351
00:28:57,698 --> 00:28:59,742
Have you ever been to Disney World?

352
00:29:00,993 --> 00:29:02,286
I haven't.

353
00:29:04,497 --> 00:29:06,207
It's beautiful.

354
00:29:08,084 --> 00:29:11,254
It's very organised. Very clean.

355
00:29:15,383 --> 00:29:17,385
What's wrong with me, Ricardo?

356
00:29:18,594 --> 00:29:20,263
Stress.

357
00:29:20,388 --> 00:29:21,889
(Pablo) Mmm.

358
00:29:22,014 --> 00:29:23,557
Stress is dangerous.

359
00:29:24,225 --> 00:29:26,143
How's the weed working out?

360
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,106
I haven'<i>t</i> been smoking a lot.

361
00:29:31,691 --> 00:29:36,654
The first man who smoked marijuana
was a Chinese emperor.

362
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:40,866
He burned the plant because
he was attracted to its smell.

363
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:44,578
But when he inhaled the smoke,
he saw a blue jay.

364
00:29:46,706 --> 00:29:51,419
And the bird told him
to conquer his neighbouring empires.

365
00:29:51,544 --> 00:29:53,129
And that's what he did.

366
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:58,592
All right.

367
00:30:00,553 --> 00:30:02,888
With you until death, Don Pablo.

368
00:30:04,015 --> 00:30:05,349
Thank you.

369
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:10,646
I'd like to stay and stand guard.

370
00:30:15,151 --> 00:30:18,029
All right. Thank you.

371
00:30:33,169 --> 00:30:36,922
Let's see, darling.
Colour inside the lines.

372
00:30:38,507 --> 00:30:39,925
There it is.

373

374

'Attention, ladies and gentlemen:

375

We need more time.

'Don'<i>t</i> let them leave the airport.

380
00:31:32,311 --> 00:31:35,773
- 'They do, it's over.'
- Right, right, right. Talk to you soon.

381
00:31:46,909 --> 00:31:48,911
Sir, I'm with the United States DEA.

382
00:31:49,036 --> 00:31:51,580
There's passengers on this flight
who can'<i>t</i> be allowed into this country.

383
00:31:51,705 --> 00:31:55,751
Heard of Pablo Escobar? Cocaine?
That's his family. You can'<i>t</i> allow them in.

384
00:31:55,876 --> 00:31:59,672
Unless there is a problem with
their passports or any type of contraband,

385
00:31:59,797 --> 00:32:01,924
they may enter Germany.

386
00:32:02,049 --> 00:32:03,634
(Murmuring in Spanish)

387
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:07,471
What about if they're transporting
a large amount of foreign currency?

388
00:32:07,596 --> 00:32:10,975
- (Man) You would be certain of this how?
- I saw <i>it.</i> I saw it with my own eyes.

389
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,061
I work with the DEA, been with
this family, I've been tracking Escobar

00:32:14,186 --> 00:32:17,064
for a long goddamn fucking time.
It is in that bag.

- (Man in English) Do you speak English?
- No.

394
00:32:24,238 --> 00:32:27,283
I'm a hundred percent certain.
That burgundy bag.

395
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,201
Fucking hell.

to the United States at once.

I'll cooperate with you.
Anything you <i>want.</i>

00:37:12,526 --> 00:37:16,238
'The government hasn'<i>t</i> done anything
to stop Los Pepes.'

464
00:37:16,363 --> 00:37:20,993
Those terrorists have attacked
my family and murdered my associates.

465
00:37:21,118 --> 00:37:26,290
Is that how the Colombian government
ensures the rights of all its citizens?

466
00:37:26,415 --> 00:37:30,878
'The president is trying to prevent
my family from entering Germany

467
00:37:31,003 --> 00:37:32,504
'and yet you do nothing about <i>it.'</i>

468
00:37:32,629 --> 00:37:37,968
That man wants to dangle my family before
Los Pepes and use my children as bait,

469
00:37:38,093 --> 00:37:41,805
and you, who call yourself a man
of principle, do nothing about it!

470
00:37:46,685 --> 00:37:48,562
(Hangs up)

471
00:37:49,438 --> 00:37:50,898
(Chatter in Spanish)

472
00:37:58,822 --> 00:38:01,700
- (Static)
- There's a lot of interference.

473
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:05,370
Yes. Medellín has too many electrical
wires, phone wires, antennae.

474
00:38:05,496 --> 00:38:08,499
- That must be why.
- What's your success rate?

475
00:38:09,374 --> 00:38:11,877
To be honest,
we haven'<i>t</i> located a signal yet.

476
00:38:12,002 --> 00:38:13,754
Not one?

477
00:38:14,588 --> 00:38:15,839
Not one.

478
00:38:18,842 --> 00:38:20,427
(Sighs)

479
00:38:23,138 --> 00:38:25,015
Here's what we're going to do, Morales.

480
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:30,813
Let's both start here: L9.329.

481
00:38:32,356 --> 00:38:33,565
There it is.

482
00:38:40,948 --> 00:38:47,621
I was talking to my police <i>contact</i> and
you won'<i>t</i> guess who's hiding the lawyer.

483
00:38:48,914 --> 00:38:52,626
None other than that son of a bitch, Peña.
What do you think about that?

484
00:38:53,961 --> 00:38:55,838
Who's your contact?

485
00:38:55,963 --> 00:39:00,717
Who he is isn'<i>t</i> important.
The important thing is that I trust him.

486
00:39:01,385 --> 00:39:03,887
And you know what
the worst part of this is?

487
00:39:04,012 --> 00:39:06,098
We can no longer trust Peña.

488
00:39:06,807 --> 00:39:09,059
Then we'll have to put a bullet in him.

489
00:39:10,769 --> 00:39:12,312
No.

490
00:39:13,188 --> 00:39:16,024
We can'<i>t</i> kill DEA agents.

491
00:39:16,149 --> 00:39:18,110
Oh, no? Why not?

492
00:39:21,154 --> 00:39:23,782
If it were up to me,
I'd feed him to the crocodiles.

493
00:39:25,617 --> 00:39:27,744
(Fidel) Berna, look...

494
00:39:34,376 --> 00:39:39,590
Schedule a meeting with Peña,
just as you have been.

495
00:39:41,008 --> 00:39:42,426
We'll take care of the rest.

496
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:52,853
(Siren wailing in distance)

497
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,490
(In English) Agent Peña.

498
00:40:46,615 --> 00:40:48,659
(* Latin music on radio)

499
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,995
I don'<i>t</i> think Don Berna's
gonna make it tonight.

500
00:41:04,424 --> 00:41:06,009
What is this?

501
00:41:06,134 --> 00:41:07,761
Just a friendly chat.

502
00:41:10,472 --> 00:41:14,226
You're making some very scary people
pretty nervous, Javier.

503
00:41:16,061 --> 00:41:18,397
Which puts me in a spot because...

504
00:41:18,522 --> 00:41:21,483
I'm the one who suggested
they approach you in the first place.

505
00:41:22,317 --> 00:41:27,322
Now, I don'<i>t</i> know what you know
about what it is I do,

506
00:41:27,447 --> 00:41:29,324
but understand this:

507
00:41:29,449 --> 00:41:32,869
I have our nation's
long-term interests in mind.

508
00:41:32,995 --> 00:41:34,955
That's the beat I walk.

509
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:38,458
And sitting here tonight,
that means making sure the right folks

510
00:41:38,583 --> 00:41:41,920
are left standing
when Escobar gets his bullet.

511
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:47,676
So do Uncle Sam a solid.

512
00:41:49,594 --> 00:41:51,430
Don'<i>t</i> complicate <i>that.</i>

513
00:41:59,896 --> 00:42:03,066
These folks are prone
to emotional decision-making.

514
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:09,197
Which can lead to bush league
nonsense like... killing a federal agent.

515
00:42:12,159 --> 00:42:13,869
By the way, they found the lawyer.

516
00:42:14,703 --> 00:42:16,496
Even without your help, so...

517
00:42:37,517 --> 00:42:40,103
(Low TV chatter)

518
00:43:34,991 --> 00:43:37,577
COURTESY OF LOS PEPES

519
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:44,501
(In Spanish) Córdoba recovers,
we'll have a goalie in place.

520
00:43:44,626 --> 00:43:48,880
Leonel Álvarez can do his thing
and move the ball along. Ooh-wee!

521
00:43:49,005 --> 00:43:51,758
(In English) Trujillo!
You follow me to the fucking hotel?

522
00:43:51,883 --> 00:43:52,926
Huh?

523
00:43:53,927 --> 00:43:57,430
(Whispers in Spanish) Did you follow me
to the hotel? You told Berna?

524
00:43:58,723 --> 00:43:59,891
Let go.

525
00:44:00,016 --> 00:44:01,810
Tell me, asshole.

526
00:44:02,519 --> 00:44:04,354
- Let go! It's all right.
- (Man) What's the problem?

527
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:07,190
(Trujillo) I'll catch up. Everything's fine.

528
00:44:08,817 --> 00:44:10,652
What's going on, Peña?

529
00:44:12,696 --> 00:44:14,656
Playing the fucking American?

530
00:44:16,116 --> 00:44:18,535
Did you see what they did to his son?

531
00:44:20,245 --> 00:44:23,957
How many families has Pablo Escobar
destroyed, Peña? Do you know?

532
00:44:26,668 --> 00:44:29,087
You don'<i>t</i> decide who lives and who dies.

533
00:44:29,212 --> 00:44:33,341
Don'<i>t</i> be fucking stupid.
This is how we do it.

534
00:45:00,327 --> 00:45:05,498
(De Greiff) 'I understand that you're
trying to prevent Escobar's family

535
00:45:05,624 --> 00:45:07,125
'from entering Germany.'

536
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:08,960
Let's make something clear.

537
00:45:09,085 --> 00:45:13,632
If you've come to plead for them
as part of some deal, the only...

538
00:45:13,757 --> 00:45:15,508
No, Mr President.

539
00:45:16,426 --> 00:45:23,391
I haven'<i>t</i> come to plead for them.
I've come to plead for you.

540
00:45:25,477 --> 00:45:27,646
For me? How so?

541
00:45:27,771 --> 00:45:31,900
I know that you want Escobar dead.

542
00:45:32,025 --> 00:45:36,404
And while I don'<i>t</i> agree with that,
I understand <i>it.</i>

543
00:45:37,405 --> 00:45:41,660
But this... this I can'<i>t</i> understand.

544
00:45:42,535 --> 00:45:45,705
This isn'<i>t</i> just wrong.

545
00:45:45,830 --> 00:45:52,629
It puts you, the president of Colombia,
in league with a death squad.

546
00:45:54,047 --> 00:46:00,262
Call the German chancellor.
Tell him to let the family in.

547
00:46:14,192 --> 00:46:16,236
(Speaking in German)

548
00:46:19,531 --> 00:46:23,576
(Man in Spanish) I'm sorry to inform you,
your entry into Germany has been denied.

549
00:46:26,871 --> 00:46:29,457
I know my rights, sir.
But you don't understand.

550
00:46:29,582 --> 00:46:31,793
My children are in danger.
Send me any place other than Colombia.

551
00:46:31,918 --> 00:46:33,712
(Speaking in German)

552
00:46:33,837 --> 00:46:39,134
(In Spanish) Tell him the children are
under age. We just want to live in peace.

553
00:46:39,259 --> 00:46:40,510
We just want to live in...

554
00:46:40,635 --> 00:46:46,308
No, no, no.
Tell him that's all we want to do.

555
00:46:46,433 --> 00:46:48,601
To live in peace.

556
00:46:49,519 --> 00:46:53,023
Get the children and your belongs.

557
00:46:53,148 --> 00:46:54,232
Please.

558
00:46:58,945 --> 00:47:02,490
(Hermilda) They kick us out of
the country, and they keep the money, too.

559
00:47:02,615 --> 00:47:05,493
- (Man speaks in German)
- (Hermilda in Spanish) I know. I'm going.

560
00:47:05,618 --> 00:47:08,663
What is this?
Why are we being treated this way?

561
00:47:08,788 --> 00:47:10,874
(Tata) You can'<i>t</i> treat us like criminals.

562
00:47:10,999 --> 00:47:12,250
(Man) Let's go.

(Tata in Spanish) Pardon me.

565
00:48:57,063 --> 00:48:58,857
I hope you enjoyed Germany.

- Two thousand pesos.

568
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,093
Thank you.

569

It's all right, ma'am, we're with
the national police. Come with us.

576
00:50:19,103 --> 00:50:21,731
The attorney general asked us
to put you under protective custody.

577

Don'<i>t</i> worry. Everything will be all right.
Come with us. You'll be safe. Let's go.

I want you to put the biggest bomb
you can get your hands on

587
00:51:22,834 --> 00:51:26,254
as close as you can
to the Presidential Palace. Clear?

(Man) One hundred pesos.

593

- Here.
- Thank you.

594

(Mother) Are we going that way?
(Father) That way, darling.

595
00:53:21,244 --> 00:53:25,039
You better be a doctor when you grow up.
This is very expensive.
