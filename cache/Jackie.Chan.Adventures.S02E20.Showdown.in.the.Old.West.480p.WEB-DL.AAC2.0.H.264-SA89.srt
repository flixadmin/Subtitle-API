1
00:00:03,903 --> 00:00:07,239
Ah. Always come back
from Reno estate sale

2
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:09,441
with good finds
for shop!

3
00:00:09,443 --> 00:00:12,111
Yes, uncle. And always
such big finds.

4
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:16,548
You should buy
bigger car!

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:19,084
More trunk space.

6
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:21,754
More trunk space
is so not a bad idea.

7
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:28,193
Jackie: Look!
Old west ghost town!

8
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:29,528
Oh! We must visit.

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,365
Ay-eee-ahh! Ghosts are nothing
to trifle with!

10
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:34,767
Tch. Ghost town

11
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:35,901
just means
old and deserted

12
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:37,636
and boring.

13
00:00:37,638 --> 00:00:40,139
I've heard that my
great-great-grandfather

14
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:43,175
came out west and lived
in a cowboy town.

15
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:45,878
I'm curious to see
what one looks like.

16
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:49,982
Driver's privilege.

17
00:00:51,017 --> 00:00:52,785
Any ghost here

18
00:00:52,787 --> 00:00:54,386
better not show face!

19
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:57,289
You do not want to mess
with uncle's herbs!

20
00:00:57,924 --> 00:01:00,092
Hmm. Not much here.

21
00:01:00,094 --> 00:01:01,226
Duh!

22
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:04,196
(Gasps) Ghost!

23
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:05,831
(Gasps)
Ayyy-yaaa!

24
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:00,686
Ghost?

25
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:01,920
Kind of.

26
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:04,623
The ghost of Jackie.

27
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:06,225
<i>"The Hong Kong kid."</i>

28
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:07,426
Ahhh-yaaa!

29
00:02:07,428 --> 00:02:09,561
Do not scare
uncle like that!

30
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:12,664
Amazing! The picture
looks just like me!

31
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:15,634
This book must be about
my great-great-grandfather.

32
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,270
Fine. Take home.
Make good bedtime story.

33
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:19,571
I wanna hear it now.

34
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:20,639
Me, too.

35
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,107
Ahem.

36
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:24,309
"It was the end
of a long day

37
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:27,946
for the men and women working
to build the new railroad."

38
00:02:31,784 --> 00:02:33,585
(Toot)

39
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:35,854
Ok, people.
Time to knock off.

40
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,258
Whew! This is
thirsty work.

41
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:44,530
I'm going to town for
a nice frosty ginger ale.

42
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:46,398
Care to join me, friend?

43
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,901
Railroad workers
are not welcome in town.

44
00:02:48,903 --> 00:02:52,304
Oh, don't be silly.
We are in America now.

45
00:02:52,306 --> 00:02:54,506
We can go anywhere
we please.

46
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:00,512
(Humming)

47
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,347
Oh, hello.

48
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:03,682
Good day.

49
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:07,085
Hot one, isn't it?

50
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:09,321
Ah...A cafe.

51
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:11,356
(Boisterous
conversation)

52
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,265
Uh...Howdy,
partners?

53
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:21,867
Well, looky here,
boys.

54
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:24,703
We got us
a railroad worker.

55
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:28,207
Railroad workers ain't allowed
in this here establishment.

56
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:30,375
Ain't that right,
Maureen?

57
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:32,377
I don't want
no trouble here.

58
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:35,581
Oh, no trouble, ma'am.
I would just like a ginger ale

59
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:38,083
with lots of ice, please.
Very thirsty.

60
00:03:38,085 --> 00:03:41,053
I've been working
on the railroad, uh...

61
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:42,921
All the livelong day?

62
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,160
We can't have no lawman

63
00:03:48,162 --> 00:03:50,562
sticking his nose
in our business, mayor.

64
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:52,264
And you shan't.

65
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:55,067
I took care
of the last sheriff,
didn't I?

66
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,235
Yeah. Well...

67
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:58,136
It's the next one
we gotta worry about.

68
00:03:58,138 --> 00:04:01,607
Can't risk nobody
putting the kibosh
on our big plan.

69
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:04,076
Hmm. I see your point.

70
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:08,113
So why not pick
a patsy for the job?

71
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:11,183
Someone who'd offer
no resistance...

72
00:04:11,185 --> 00:04:12,918
A bumbler. A fool.

73
00:04:13,886 --> 00:04:15,487
Someone like...

74
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:18,991
That was not very
nice of you--

75
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:21,026
ooh!

76
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,731
Him.

77
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,569
This is a very
great honor, Mr. mayor.

78
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,271
But why me?

79
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:34,206
Well,
because you're...

80
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:36,908
A railroad worker!

81
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,577
And railroad workers

82
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:41,079
always make
the best sheriffs.

83
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:44,249
I did not know that.
I won't let you down.

84
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:46,451
No, I'm quite sure
you won't.

85
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:49,688
Niece: Uncle Jackie?

86
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:53,492
Uh...I am Jackie.

87
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:54,726
I am your niece...

88
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:56,495
Just arrived
from Hong Kong.

89
00:04:56,497 --> 00:04:58,330
This is so cool!

90
00:04:58,332 --> 00:05:00,999
She's my long-lost,
great-great something
or other!

91
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:03,135
I betcha she looked
exactly like me.

92
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:06,038
Actually, it says here
that the sheriff's niece

93
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,373
was very tall
and 15 years old.

94
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,975
Must be a typo.

95
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:27,292
I trust the preparations
are complete?

96
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:29,161
Indeed they are, shendu.

97
00:05:29,163 --> 00:05:31,797
The stagecoach
comes through town
tomorrow morning,

98
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:33,932
and the gold
and the antiquities

99
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:36,568
bound for the new
San Francisco museum

100
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:38,570
shall be on board.

101
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:40,839
And among those
antiquities

102
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,841
the horse talisman,

103
00:05:42,843 --> 00:05:47,646
possessing the power
to free me from this
miserable stone casement!

104
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:49,648
You do remember
our little deal.

105
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,718
Once free,
you will help us
get even more gold.

106
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:58,056
Uh, at your earliest
convenience, of course.

107
00:05:58,058 --> 00:06:01,560
You'll probably
want to freshen up,
stretch the old legs--

108
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:03,161
and what steps
have you taken

109
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:05,731
to prevent
any interference?

110
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:08,367
I've handpicked
a new sheriff.

111
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:10,335
A real find.

112
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:15,374
Yeech. I hate unpacking.
It is <i> such</i> hard work.

113
00:06:15,376 --> 00:06:17,876
You should try
building a railroad.

114
00:06:18,444 --> 00:06:19,611
"The sheriff

115
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:21,880
"soon earned the respect
of the townspeople

116
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,883
because of his bravery
and heroism."

117
00:06:24,885 --> 00:06:26,785
Oh, it's black Bart,
sheriff!

118
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:27,953
He's loose!

119
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:29,388
Oh, bad outlaw?

120
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,123
My cat!

121
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:33,525
He won't come down
off that roof!

122
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,432
Here, kitty kitty.

123
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:49,374
Got you!

124
00:06:49,376 --> 00:06:50,876
Whoa!

125
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:52,611
Whoa-oa-oa!

126
00:06:52,613 --> 00:06:53,745
Uh--

127
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:55,914
old lady: Oh!

128
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,684
Naughty little
black Bart!

129
00:06:59,686 --> 00:07:01,853
You had mama
worried sick.

130
00:07:01,855 --> 00:07:03,688
Oh, thank you, sheriff.

131
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,724
You're welcome.

132
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:07,359
Niece, I will see you

133
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:10,395
when the big hand
is on the 6.

134
00:07:10,397 --> 00:07:13,565
"The town had never had
a lawman like sheriff Jackie.

135
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:16,001
"No lawbreaker was immune
from his tough

136
00:07:16,003 --> 00:07:18,570
but fair brand
of frontier justice."

137
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,108
You will have to
pick those up.

138
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,877
We have very strict laws
against littering.

139
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,946
Just feedin'
my mule, sheriff.

140
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:29,281
I can appreciate that,

141
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:31,883
but I was hired
to clean up this town, so...

142
00:07:31,885 --> 00:07:34,319
So you either throw 'em
in the trash can,

143
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:36,421
or we throw you
in the pokey.

144
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:39,090
Ha ha! Yeah, sure.
Whatever you say,
girlie.

145
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:41,560
Girlie? <i> I</i> happen to be
his deputy.

146
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:43,662
Niece, you are not
my deputy.

147
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:45,764
But she is right
about--oh!

148
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,835
"The job sometimes
got rough,

149
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:51,169
"but wet or dry,

150
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:53,772
the sheriff would
always get his man."

151
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:56,308
Perhaps a night in jail
will make you think twice

152
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,577
before breaking
the law again.

153
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:01,513
Uh-oh.

154
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:02,614
I would like you

155
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:03,782
to go talk
to the mayor.

156
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:04,983
Deputy business?

157
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,919
Uh...Yes!
Jail cell
needs repair.

158
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:09,254
Tch! Fine.

159
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:11,990
Doubt Annie oakley
started out like this.

160
00:08:11,992 --> 00:08:13,258
This new sheriff's

161
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:15,026
a real burr
in my saddle, mayor.

162
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:17,062
Thought he was
supposed to be
a patsy.

163
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:18,296
Oh, please.

164
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:20,298
Apprehending
litterbugs?

165
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,900
Saving kittens?

166
00:08:21,902 --> 00:08:23,902
This fellow's nothing
but a dim bulb

167
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:26,071
with a shiny badge.

168
00:08:26,073 --> 00:08:29,074
I guarantee
our stagecoach heist

169
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:31,510
will go off
without a hitch.

170
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,784
Well, well, well.

171
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:43,622
We've got us a no-good,
snoopin' little varmint.

172
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:45,957
What do you think
we ought to do with her?

173
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:49,194
How's about we tie her
to a cactus out
on the prairie,

174
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,229
let the buzzards decide?

175
00:08:57,637 --> 00:09:00,438
Jackie, reading: "There
she was, the sheriff's niece,

176
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,208
"caught red-handed
spying on the bad guys.

177
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,211
Suddenly, she opened
her mouth and--"

178
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:07,913
(speaking
Chinese)

179
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:13,585
She obviously
understands no English.

180
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:15,020
Let her go.

181
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,958
Whoa! Now, that was
one smooth move.

182
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,162
"The niece tipped off
the sheriff

183
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:25,564
about what she
had heard."

184
00:09:25,566 --> 00:09:27,566
The mayor?
Those nice men?

185
00:09:27,568 --> 00:09:29,801
Oh, you must have
misunderstood.

186
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:31,570
Hello!

187
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:34,139
I was the one
talking Chinese,
not them!

188
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:35,974
I understood
perfectly!

189
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:37,442
Uh, yes.

190
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:40,078
I am heading out
to pay a visit
to an old friend.

191
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,413
Please mind the office.

192
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,715
Right! And work
on the case.

193
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:45,584
Hey, quite a load
you're carryin'!

194
00:09:45,586 --> 00:09:47,919
Payroll for every town
from here to Tahoe,

195
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:49,287
plus some
far-east artifacts

196
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:50,989
for that new museum
in San Fran.

197
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:52,223
Well, thanks, partner.

198
00:09:52,225 --> 00:09:54,025
See you next month.

199
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,498
It's so shiny!

200
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:03,635
I Polish it often.

201
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:06,538
Ah...From
railroad worker
to sheriff.

202
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,974
It seems...
Impossible.

203
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:12,644
Actually, railroad workers
make the best sheriffs.

204
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:14,479
I did not know that.

205
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:19,451
Hey-yah!

206
00:10:19,453 --> 00:10:20,719
Tch, tch, tch.

207
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:23,521
Speeding in a railroad
construction zone.

208
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,626
Please, stop the--oh!

209
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:31,162
(Coughing)

210
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:38,870
You are speeding!

211
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:40,271
Pull over!

212
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,910
Oh!

213
00:10:45,912 --> 00:10:47,145
Uh-oh.

214
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,517
(Small voice)
Ow.

215
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:59,057
Hey, this stage
is carrying
government--

216
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:01,059
aah! Oof!

217
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:02,927
Deputy niece
to the rescue!

218
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:05,096
Deputy niece
must wait here.

219
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:12,404
I'm talkin' some
serious dinero!

220
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,240
Please pull over!

221
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:17,509
He said please!
Yeah, right!

222
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:20,078
I guess here is where
I earn my pay.

223
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:24,849
Ow! Oh--gaaah!

224
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:27,786
Oh--oh--ow--ow!
Bad day!

225
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:29,087
Bad day!

226
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:38,396
Wha--aah!

227
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,371
Ha ha ha ha ha!

228
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,175
You are in
very big trouble!

229
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,278
Not as big as you!

230
00:12:06,025 --> 00:12:08,126
Uh--ravine!
Hit the brakes!

231
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,962
Sorry,
railroad worker.

232
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:12,764
I'm off this train!

233
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:19,871
Aah! Bad day at black rock!

234
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:27,946
Jackie, reading:
"It looked like curtains

235
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:30,381
for sheriff Jackie,
when--" huh?

236
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,984
Why did you stop?
What happened next?

237
00:12:34,887 --> 00:12:36,054
The page is missing!

238
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:38,389
Boring story,
anyway.

239
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:43,361
Baa! That is the fate
of my great-great-grandfather

240
00:12:43,363 --> 00:12:46,197
that you are using
to clean your glasses!

241
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,966
(Clears throat)

242
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:50,702
"In a spectacular feat
of derring-do,

243
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:53,571
sheriff Jackie
took control of the reins."

244
00:12:57,309 --> 00:12:58,743
Thank you, sheriff.

245
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:00,779
There's
a whole lotta folks
counting on that cargo

246
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:02,180
for their paychecks.

247
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:04,149
Just doin' my job.

248
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:07,051
I grow impatient, valmont!

249
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:10,922
I trust your men
were able to pull off
a simple robbery.

250
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:12,791
Rest assured, shendu,

251
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:13,892
my boys will be

252
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:16,561
rendezvousing
with us momentarily.

253
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:18,296
You see?

254
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,532
Uh...Ran into
a little trouble.

255
00:13:20,534 --> 00:13:22,066
That sheriff you hired.

256
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:24,502
You didn't get the gold?!

257
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:25,570
Shendu: Fools!

258
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:27,672
Hey, hold on,
shen-dude.

259
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:29,774
Ain't exactly
like we came back
empty-handed.

260
00:13:29,776 --> 00:13:31,376
(Clicks tongue)

261
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,149
Got the horse
off the stagecoach,
just like you asked.

262
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,285
I didn't want the horse!

263
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:42,487
I wanted the horse talisman!

264
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,456
Oh. Uh...

265
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,692
What's a talisman?

266
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:49,828
Valmont: You have
my word, shendu.

267
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,497
They will be tarred
and feathered.

268
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,799
But first things first--

269
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:57,669
this meddling sheriff
must pay.

270
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:00,738
Count me out.
That guy ain't human.

271
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,576
And that is why
you shall use magic
to defeat him.

272
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:10,315
So...How do we
work 'em?

273
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:14,219
You don't.
The magic works
by itself.

274
00:14:14,787 --> 00:14:16,054
Neat-o.

275
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:25,430
You dare to spy on <i> me?!</i>

276
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:26,731
Uh-oh...

277
00:14:28,033 --> 00:14:29,200
Whoa!

278
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:35,473
The stagecoach company
will probably give you
a big reward.

279

"Meet us for a showdown at
the lucky corral at high noon.

280

Signed, the bad guys."

281
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,384
Oh, this is very bad.

282
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,019
What are you
talking about?

283
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:50,555
You bushwhacked 'em
last time, didn't you?
You'll do it again.

284
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:54,092
No. They will be using
powerful...

285
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:56,461
Unh...Unh.

286
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:58,496
Powerful what?
Tell me!

287
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:00,498
"Sheriff Jackie
was very worried,

288

through the window

Hi. Remember me?

297

Ah, girl from Hong Kong.
Look different.

298
00:15:30,664 --> 00:15:32,964
Thought you were 15
and taller.

299
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:36,000
It was a typo.

300
00:15:36,002 --> 00:15:40,338
Ahh...Now story
getting interesting.

00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,700
Give it here!
Uncle hate suspense.

327
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:45,236
"Old clock tower
struck high noon

328
00:16:45,238 --> 00:16:48,673
"as sheriff Jackie started
long walk to lucky corral.

329
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:51,943
"From opposite direction,

330
00:16:51,945 --> 00:16:54,345
outlaws headed
that way as well."

331
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:05,490
"Let's do this,"
said the bad guy.

332
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:12,764
"T?" What's that
supposed to mean,

333
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:14,132
he wants some tea?

334
00:17:14,134 --> 00:17:18,136
Time-out.
No firearms, ok?

335
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:19,504
A fair fight.

336
00:17:19,506 --> 00:17:23,241
Fair fight? Sure.
No problem-o, amigo.

337
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,681
Gotta tip my hat
to you, sheriff.

338
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:32,150
Anytime now.

339
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:35,520
Ahh, magic.

340
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:42,660
Oh, more bad day,
more bad day!

341
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:47,999
You forgot your hat.

342
00:17:48,001 --> 00:17:49,133
Huh?

343
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:50,935
(Muffled grumbling)

344
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:54,272
Oh, this ought
to be good.

345
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,242
Daaaaahhhhh!

346
00:17:58,244 --> 00:17:59,410
Ohh, ohh, ohh.

347
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:02,346
Wee-hah! Hog-tied
like a heifer.

348
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:03,981
Ohh.

349
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:09,253
Hold this, please.

350
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,722
Huh? What the--

351
00:18:11,724 --> 00:18:14,025
whoa, whoa. Guuh.

352
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:15,927
(Grunts)

353
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:23,768
Uh, we had an agreement--
no firearms.

354
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,837
Guess I missed that meeting.

355
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:29,507
Ever been locked in
a 4-foot stall with
a bucking bronco?

356
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:30,675
Once.

357
00:18:31,877 --> 00:18:33,945
Jade:
¶ oh, Mr. mayor... ¶

358
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,518
huh?

359
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,088
Hmm, Shanghai surprise
good for digestion,

360
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:46,124
bad for everything else.

361
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,797
I hope you all
enjoy your new home.

362
00:18:57,936 --> 00:19:00,304
I reckon we had you
wrong, sheriff.

363
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:01,506
You're ok.

364
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:03,975
Like to thank you for
cleaning up the town.

365
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:06,210
Oh, well, you know
what they say--

366
00:19:06,212 --> 00:19:09,013
railroad workers always
make the best sheriffs.

367
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:10,848
Speaking of which...

368
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:15,052
Please welcome
your new sheriff.

369
00:19:15,054 --> 00:19:16,521
New sheriff?

370
00:19:19,191 --> 00:19:21,225
Hmm, shiny.

371
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:26,164
I am retiring.
I miss the fresh air,
the open spaces.

372
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,533
I am going back
to the railroad.

373
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,103
Looks like peddler
has new assistant.

374
00:19:32,105 --> 00:19:33,237
Really?

375
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:34,839
Cool. What do I do?

376
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:36,174
Make tea.

377
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:37,708
Ach...

378
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,211
Uh, old peddler man,
where are you heading?

379
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:41,479
Railroad is the other way.

380
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:42,680
Forget railroad.

381
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:45,316
Plenty more bottle
of elixir to sell.

382
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:47,084
Yeah. And plenty
more towns

383
00:19:47,086 --> 00:19:48,953
that need
cleaning up.

384
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:54,792
"And off they rode,
into sunset. The end."

385
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,263
Oh, it is nice to know

386
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:01,999
that my ancestor
was such a hero.

387
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:03,634
-Jackie a hero?
-Jackie a hero?

388
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:05,036
Hoo!
- Ha!

389
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:07,271
It was old-west Jade
who saved his butt.

390
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:10,641
You're crazy.
Old peddler man saved day.

391
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:17,381
Hey, Jackie?

392
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:18,549
Yes?

393
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:20,751
What's your Chinese name?

394
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:23,387
My real, real, real name

395
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:26,424
is called fong shu lo.

396
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:28,526
In the school
in Australia,

397
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:30,494
they asked me,
"what's your name?"

398
00:20:30,496 --> 00:20:32,163
I said, "my name
Chang Kong sun."

399
00:20:32,165 --> 00:20:33,231
"No, no, no.

400
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,066
Ok, your name Steven."

401
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:36,467
Yeah, I becoming a Steven.

402
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:37,802
In the factory,

403
00:20:37,804 --> 00:20:40,638
the building bilker
asked me what's my name.

404
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,173
My friend said, "Jack."

405
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:43,708
J-a-c-k.

406
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,010
Then, after I know
a little bit English,

407
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:47,144
then a j-a-c--Jackie.

408
00:20:47,146 --> 00:20:48,613
I think I like rhythm.

409
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:49,814
Jackie.
