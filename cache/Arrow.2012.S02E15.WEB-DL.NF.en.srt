I need you to see something.

Okay. Wait.

490
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:58,007
You need me.

491
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,968
Okay? You have the <i>Mirakuru</i> in you.

492
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,887
Not just in me.

493
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:12,188
You burned a box full of dirt.

I can help you understand how it works.

-I've spent my entire life studying it, all right?
-It was you.

496
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,573
You were the one who killed Shado.

497
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:23,158
No.

498
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:26,536
No, he chose. It was him.

499
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,419
Give him your gun.

500

Take it.

501
00:37:39,716 --> 00:37:41,384
And show me...

00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,678
...how you killed Shado.

This isn't you.

It's the <i>Mirakuru</i>...

...and you're sick.

I don't care.

509
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:09,078
I was trying to protect Sara.

510
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:16,127
But I didn't want Shado to die.
I cared for her too, and you know that I did.

I don't care.

512

You said we were brothers.

513
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,846
You said that.

514
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:29,891
Is that how you did it?

-Is that how you pointed the gun at her?
-Yes.

Why don't you just kill me?

If I kill you now...

...it would be a mercy.

I know you and I have our differences,
but they hardly excuse your behavior tonight.
