1
00:00:02,002 --> 00:00:03,413
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:10,716
I'm arresting you for the murder

3
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:13,260
of the boy you blew up
under the Crown Point Bridge.

4
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:15,759
You blew that kid sky-high.

5
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:19,263
You are lying! You are a lying traitor!

6
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:23,729
I need you at the head of the GCPD.

7
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,940
Let them think you're a hero.

8
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:27,851
I screwed up, Harv.

9
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:31,363
Sofia hired the Pyg.
And I covered it up.

10
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,191
<i>We all have to make sacrifices.</i>

11
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,405
<i>Thought i was all about family.</i>

12
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:38,198
Never said it was a happy family.

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,787
My friend thinks we're here to rob you.

14
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:46,460
<i>But I know you torture plants</i>

15
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:49,335
<i>in the name of science, Roland Charles.</i>

16
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:57,680
Lee Thompkins may have made Ed strong,
but I see the other you.

17
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,224
<i>The Riddler.</i>

18
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,596
I'm back.

19
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,892
What's that smell?

20
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,226
Uncle Penguin sent me to get you.

21
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:15,814
Come on, let's get ice cream.

22
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,663
The Narrows is under new management.

23
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,038
The Narrows is Sampson's turf.

24
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:40,343
And Sampson...
Well, collects protection.

25
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,800
And people need to find out what happens

26
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:45,799
when you don't pay!

27
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,898
Please. My family.

28
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,355
Do I look like an animal to you?

29
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:00,863
I wouldn't hurt your family.

30
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,115
Unless they don't pay me!

31
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,913
Before Don Falcone died,

32
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,546
he warned me, I had no idea
what I'd brought to the city.

33
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,679
I now know he was talking about the Pyg.

34
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:26,968
Somebody must've told him.

35
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:32,137
My guess, that person has evidence
that links Sofia to the Pyg's murders.

36
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,309
Why not come forward with what you know?

37
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,933
It has to be more than just
my word against hers.

38
00:04:37,027 --> 00:04:39,565
Or are you afraid the truth is
going to drag you down, too?

39
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,151
- Oh, Harvey, we've been over this.
- When did you know?

40
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:47,076
I swear, I had no idea
until after it was too late.

41
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,988
Now, you can be pissed,
but this is bigger than both of us.

42
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,626
I need to know I can count on you.

43
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,543
Yeah, Jim.

44
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,756
I'll help you take down Sofia.

45
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,723
But then you're gonna have to pay
for what you've done.

46
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,229
I personally guarantee it.

47
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:20,151
I know an ex-Falcone assassin.
Might have beans to spill.

48
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,445
Went by the name
"the Scandinavian Skinner."

49
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,447
Sit tight.
I have history with the Skinner.

50
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:55,682
You know, you have, like,
no food in here, right?

51
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:57,763
Selina?

52
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:01,438
What are you doing here? What's...
What's wrong?

53
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,483
Why does something
have to be wrong for me to come by?

54
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:06,146
Seriously?

55
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:12,285
I need help.

56
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:15,239
You mean money.

57
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:20,078
I stole something, fenced it,
now I want to get it back.

58
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,879
And I'd steal it,
but the fence is difficult.

59
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,291
So, I need money.

60
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,176
Why don't you just ask
Barbara Kean for the money?

61
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,799
'Cause I don't wanna get her involved.

62
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,430
Look, I'll pay you back.

63
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:34,054
I just don't have time
because if the fence sells what I...

64
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,601
But you still haven't told me
why you wanna get it back.

65
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:38,521
Because it's what I stole
from Roland Charles.

66
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:43,901
- The Wayne scientist...
- That Ivy killed.

67
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,152
I didn't know
she was gonna do that, Bruce.

68
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,571
And I just...

69
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,110
You feel bad.

70
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:58,116
Look, if you don't wanna help me,
then I'll just find another way.

71
00:06:58,209 --> 00:06:59,199
Let me get some cash.

72
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,292
There's oatmeal raisin cookies
in the blue tin.

73
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:15,800
Why are you dragging me here?

74
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:18,928
Cobblepot.

75
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,898
A guy called.
Wanted me to give you a message.

76
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,485
Finally!

77
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:32,529
"I can lend you a hand,
but you won't find me helpful.

78
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:36,242
"My name may sound tasty,
but the flavor is dreadful."

79
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,041
Is it "knuckle sandwich"?

80
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,294
- Yeah.
- No.

81
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,467
Hello, Agnes.

82
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:02,559
Or should I say, "the Skinner"?

83
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:06,772
Detective Bullock.

84
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:09,236
I don't go by that name anymore.

85
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,109
I'm retired.

86
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:15,367
- You kids, don't spoil your dinner.
- Okay, Grandma.

87
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:18,704
I'm looking for someone

88
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,749
who might've been Don Falcone's
eyes and ears when he was down south.

89
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:23,459
Why would I tell you that?

90
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,411
Because we have history.

91
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,835
That history got me four years
in the gulag.

92
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,167
Either you help me,

93
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,052
or I tell your beautiful grandchildren

94
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,677
how their meemaw
used to skin people alive.

95
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:40,677
Hey, kids, you wanna hear
a really funny story?

96
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,682
All right. No, it's all right.

97
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:43,762
Never mind.

98
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:50,186
Falcone only really trusted
the bookkeeper.

99
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,481
The one who always smelled of fish.

100
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:56,442
- Mr. Penn?
- Yeah.

101
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:58,277
Penn.

102
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:02,202
And good luck finding him.
I heard he vanished.

103
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:03,782
Poof.

104
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:09,042
How is Martin gone?

105
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,125
Never mind.

106
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:14,968
Penguin is coming.

107
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,922
Go to Arkham and kill him now.

108
00:09:18,433 --> 00:09:19,423
Okey-dokey.

109
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:20,804
Oh, by the way...

110
00:09:20,894 --> 00:09:22,305
...a buddy of mine
just got out of the hospital.

111
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,385
He's looking for work.

112
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,062
You mind if he tags along?

113
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:28,682
Hiya.

114
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:36,191
Just make sure Penguin dies
choking on his own blood.

115
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,031
Why is Cobblepot
in the infirmary?

116
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,330
Heard he mouthed off to a guard,
then slipped and hit his head.

117
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,957
Bullock. This is a surprise.

118
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:55,133
Hey, Oswald. Good to see you, too.

119
00:09:55,637 --> 00:09:58,550
I just had a few questions about
a former employee of yours.

120
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:01,883
They got guns!

121
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:03,509
Open that door!

122
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,441
Everybody, split up.

123
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,897
Get out of the way. Clear out!

124
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:18,656
Move, move, move!

125
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:20,818
Hey!

126
00:10:22,372 --> 00:10:24,785
You two, don't come any closer.

127
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,365
Bullock?

128
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,410
Dude, I thought you stopped being a cop.

129
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:31,624
Guess it didn't take, huh?

130
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,247
Not so much.

131
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,501
- You remember Wendell, don't you?
- Howdy.

132
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,053
I don't know why you two are here,
and I don't care.

133
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,005
Walk away!

134
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,592
See, I'm afraid we can't do that.

135
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,762
We're not leaving here
without the Penguin.

136
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,937
Harvey. Do yourself a favor,

137
00:10:57,448 --> 00:11:02,034
give us Penguin,
and live to get drunk another day. Hmm?

138
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,741
As tempting as that sounds, no.

139
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:12,874
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

140
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:17,375
It's okay.

141
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,134
We'll come back.

142
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:23,009
He's escaped.
Oswald Cobblepot has escaped.

143
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:47,325
Nygma.

144
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:50,574
What?

145
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,411
You're just different.

146
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,503
Different how?

147
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,962
You were a complete douchebag to me
at the club.

148
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,632
And now you're not.

149
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,431
Listen, Selina, about that night...

150
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:10,136
Oh, no, you're not going to try
to apologize to me, are you?

151
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,350
No, I just wanted to say...

152
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,476
Save it.

153
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,694
Because you are probably going to be
a douchebag to me later anyway.

154
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,690
Missed you, too.

155
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,284
Kitty Cat, back so soon?

156
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:35,452
'Sup, Floyd?

157
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:41,633
I'm gonna need that stuff
I brought to you the other day.

158
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,751
Oh.

159
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,180
You mean this stuff?

160
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,553
The stuff you tried to break in
and steal last night?

161
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:52,436
You think I wouldn't check the camera?

162
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,720
Great.

163
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,978
You remember what I said
about being a douchebag?

164
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,774
I'll pay double what you gave me.

165
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:03,151
This your bank?

166
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:08,903
How about I take the money

167
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,198
and I keep your stuff?

168
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:32,926
Next time...

169
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,679
...take the deal.

170
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,815
Got it.

171
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:50,115
I knew that as soon as I rescued Martin
that she'd send her hitmen.

172
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:52,571
How is Martin?

173
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:55,366
Snug as a bug in a rug.
Here, will you hold this?

174
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:57,785
So, do you wanna know how I found him?

175
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:02,332
So it turns out, Zsasz,
huge fan of the disco.

176
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:05,668
- So I dress up as an old Polish...
- Perhaps another time!

177
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:09,301
Now that Martin is safe,
we need to focus on killing Sofia.

178
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,676
We need a power base.

179
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:13,510
I know. That's why we're here.

180
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:22,142
Hello.

181
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:26,108
Ed. You're back.

182
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,152
- Mmm-hmm.
- How are you doing?

183
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,952
Worlds better. Honestly, thank you.

184
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,320
I...

185
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:36,369
Oh, no. What happened to your hand?

186
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:38,621
Sofia Falcone.

187
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:43,080
Smashed it with a hammer,
and then threw me out on the street.

188
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:45,461
And put Sampson in charge
of The Narrows.

189
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,251
I see.

190
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:49,712
But together,
we can get that bitch back.

191
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:52,806
Show her that she can't
just take everything we've built.

192
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,516
Yeah, Oswald, she can't help.

193
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,427
What is this?

194
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,556
What is going on? What's wrong with you?

195
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:05,482
I let him out of his cage, and he,
in turn, helped me get out of mine.

196
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:08,355
You're him.

197
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,065
The Riddler.

198
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,110
Hi, Lee.

199
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:16,204
You know, I was really hoping that
you were still running The Narrows,

200
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,538
maybe could help us, but...

201
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:20,742
Guess not.

202
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:21,998
Yeah, so what's
your next brilliant idea?

203
00:15:22,505 --> 00:15:24,963
Sofia will have turned Falcone Mansion
into a stronghold.

204
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,915
It will be impossible to get at her.

205
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,217
Oswald, you think
I don't have a backup plan?

206
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,924
I'm gonna have Victor Fries
put you in a block of ice.

207
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:35,599
I'm gonna take you to Sofia
like a chilly Trojan horse,

208
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,597
pretend to hand you over...

209
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:40,513
Are you kidding me?

210
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,181
It's a fantastic plan.

211
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:44,391
Try again!

212
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,602
All right, let me help.

213
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,146
Look, all of your capos
have pledged their loyalty to Sofia...

214
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,526
Do you think I can't handle it?

215
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:51,948
I know you can't.

216
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,400
Look what she did to me.

217
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,569
I will pull the trigger
on that bitch myself.

218
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,113
That's some tough tongue,
but we both know that's just talk.

219
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,789
Enough! Both of you.

220
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:02,751
If we wanna fight Sofia, we need muscle.

221
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:04,453
I agree.

222
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:07,835
I can tell you where to look.

223
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,630
Don't you think he misses you?

224
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:16,802
Who... Who is she talking about?

225
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,639
Grundy!

226
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:25,808
You down here, big fella?

227
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:28,018
Your best friend and pal,

228
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:30,483
Edward Nygma.

229
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,738
Hey, guess what? I'm smart again!

230
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:42,870
There he is.

231
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,619
Pale skin, nobody upstairs...

232
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:46,874
Who's my buddy?

233
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,006
Correct. You.

234
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:51,629
Oh, boy.

235
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,506
So, we're corralling allies.

236
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:55,758
Penguin and I are going
to kill Sofia Falcone.

237
00:16:55,848 --> 00:17:00,388
And we need a big galoot like you
for cannon fodder. How does that sound?

238
00:17:04,482 --> 00:17:06,474
What's your problem?
Why are you looking at me like that?

239
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,352
Oh, dear.

240
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,608
You're not the only one who got smart.

241
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:16,032
Okay, Butch, I helped you.

242
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,951
You remember?

243
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,278
Hot, hot arm.

244
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,159
Yeah, Ed put out fire.

245
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:23,161
But you're not Ed anymore.

246
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:25,701
And I'm not Grundy.

247
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,290
Where the hell is Ed?

248
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:33,583
He'll be here.

249
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:37,133
No. No, he's betrayed me, too.

250
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,431
I know it.
I never should have trusted him!

251
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,091
Calm down.

252
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,763
No, do not tell me to calm down.

253
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,890
You have no idea what I've been through!

254
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,726
Calm down! Ed will be here.

255
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:50,859
He will bring Grundy,
and we will make Sofia pay.

256
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,147
I can't wait any longer.

257
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,201
How did Nygma
get in touch with Penguin anyway?

258
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:05,328
I don't know.

259
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:06,954
Nothing's ever easy with you, is it?

260
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,661
It's always like, "Find Lee,
and then she'll point us to Ed.

261
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,166
"And then we'll find Penguin,

262
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,294
"and he'll tell us where to find Penn."

263
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,252
Or we could just
talk to Oswald right now.

264
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,335
What?

265
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,339
Hey, you son of a...

266
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:23,883
What are you doing here?

267
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:28,143
We're looking for an Arkham escapee
about yea tall, walks with a limp,

268
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,393
mommy complex?

269
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:34,103
Those trumped-up charges
you used to put me away

270
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,899
have lost their teeth.

271
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,233
- Martin is still alive.
- So produce him.

272
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,114
Nope. He is not safe

273
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:45,413
until Sofia Falcone
has been dealt with permanently.

274
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,959
I think you and I want
the same thing, Oswald.

275
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,995
We both want Sofia to go away.

276
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,383
Then turn around and walk away.

277
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,589
Let me do what I do.

278
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:02,010
No. I want her in jail,
and for that I need evidence.

279
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,258
I want your bookkeeper, Mr. Penn.

280
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,889
What would he know about...

281
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:12,145
That little weasel was working for her!

282
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:17,446
Yeah, he was working for her,
for Don Falcone, everybody!

283
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,614
You might want to check
your management style, pal.

284
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:23,818
I'm gonna kill him.

285
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,370
Oswald. Oswald.

286
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,540
Calm down.

287
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:32,290
You show us where we can find Mr. Penn,

288
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,042
and I'll let you walk away.

289
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,500
I don't believe you.

290
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,586
Sofia sent Zsasz
to Arkham to kill you.

291
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,424
Her goons run The Narrows.

292
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:45,383
How long do you think it's gonna take
till she finds you?

293
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:03,117
I overheard Mr. Penn talk about a place
just out of town, near the tri-corner.

294
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,534
The Spa Bosh Sumka.

295
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,912
Offers special therapy.

296
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:10,582
If he's hiding, he's probably there.

297
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,950
Oswald.

298
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,376
Thank you.

299
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,005
That's really nice.
Now, put your hands behind your back.

300
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:28,718
No. No! No, we had a deal!

301
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:29,847
Harvey, what are you doing?

302
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,553
If you want to look
the other way, Jim, fine.

303
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,472
I didn't agree to squat. Come on.

304
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:36,855
No! No!

305
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,659
- I will not forget this!
- Relax.

306
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,078
If your information on Penn is good,

307
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:50,156
at least you'll be free
of Sofia Falcone.

308
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:51,827
Well, well, well.

309
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:56,669
Sofia's gonna be very curious to know
why you're looking for Penn.

310
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,373
Hey, Penguin. Remember me?

311
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,966
Oh, God, no.

312
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:05,296
Wait, is Penn important or something?

313
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:09,967
That's a yes. You see that?
That's his "yes" face.

314
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,267
Get him in the car.

315
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:15,722
Guess I'll have to go dig him up myself.

316
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,563
Now, you boys want to come quietly,

317
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,070
or do you want to do it the fun way?

318
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:30,245
The fun way. Nice.

319
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,967
- Lee.
- Shut up and get down.

320
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,174
Lee?

321
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:01,606
Come on. Let's get out of here.

322
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,572
We need to get to Penn
before Zsasz does.

323
00:22:07,952 --> 00:22:08,942
We need a car.

324
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,291
Migraine still?

325
00:22:25,386 --> 00:22:27,252
It's like I've been hit in the head
with a brick.

326
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,554
What is that stink?

327
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:35,431
Should've known.

328
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,100
Grundy smell like old dentures.

329
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,014
It's him.

330
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:43,109
I know. I can smell him.

331
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,357
Hey there, Barbara.

332
00:22:49,994 --> 00:22:50,984
Scary.

333
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,994
Nygma tried to recruit me against Sofia.

334
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,327
He's working for Penguin.

335
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,579
I figured after all Ed did to you,
you should be the one to kill him.

336
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:07,417
Wait, Butch.

337
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:11,054
Don't just walk away again.

338
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:14,175
Tabby, I'm gonna find a way
to get back to the old me.

339
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:17,302
I promise.

340
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:40,033
Any ideas?

341
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:44,333
You okay?

342
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:47,832
I'm fine.

343
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:51,132
We send Nygma back to Sofia.

344
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:53,342
She will torture him to get to Penguin.

345
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,798
Lee has no more allies.

346
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:57,760
Boom, rebellion quells, we're heroes.

347
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:01,058
Then what about Nygma?
He just gets to walk away?

348
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:05,146
When Sofia doesn't need him anymore,
she'll kill him.

349
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:10,230
Same end result, none of the headache.

350
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,527
Well, we did find Penguin,
but then he got away.

351
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,572
So why aren't you looking for him,
instead of wasting my time?

352
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:22,913
Because I also found out that Gordon
is looking for Mr. Penn.

353
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,209
Find Penn before Gordon does.

354
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:37,091
Yeah, so, Penn, Penguin...
I mean, where are we priorities-wise?

355
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:39,092
Do both.

356
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,350
Thank you for coming to my rescue.

357
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:48,651
Don't bother.
Without you, I can't get to Sofia.

358
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,186
Touching.

359
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,648
- I cannot believe I'm doing this.
- Believe it.

360
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:56,360
No Ed, no Grundy.
We're running out of time.

361
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:59,700
You know this cockamamie scheme
will probably get me killed?

362
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,703
If it puts Sofia in the ground,
I'm okay with that.

363
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:06,370
The last time you came in here

364
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:08,796
with one of your schemes
to regain the city,

365
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:13,381
you promised every resource
I needed to reverse my condition.

366
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:18,799
So, that didn't happen.

367
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:24,145
An omission I regret,
and will rectify if given the chance.

368
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,014
Uh-huh.

369
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:37,359
You cannot honestly tell me
you are happy here.

370
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:40,366
Tinkering away, on whatever these...

371
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:42,822
Don't touch that.

372
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:47,832
You need money for your research,
Sofia wants Penguin.

373
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:50,414
So you deliver him to her,
you can name your price.

374
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:54,292
I may have something.

375
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:02,016
Keep this on you. It's on a timer.
Best I can do on short notice.

376
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,603
If being frozen affects my brain
the way it did Nygma,

377
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:06,896
- I cannot afford...
- Ready?

378
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,939
- Not yet! I...
- Don't care.

379
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:30,920
So now you're going to return it?

380
00:26:35,219 --> 00:26:36,710
- Selina, you said...
- Can you do it?

381
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,596
That's really why you came to me.

382
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:43,550
It wasn't about the money.

383
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,942
You did not kill Roland Charles.

384
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,319
I was there, though.

385
00:27:05,541 --> 00:27:07,373
And what am I supposed to say, I...

386
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:11,457
"I stole your jewelry. Sorry."

387
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:14,835
Sometimes that's enough.

388
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:31,473
His strength of mind is impressive.

389
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:41,532
You are going to tell me
where to find Penguin,

390
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:45,866
or I will make all of this
look like a pleasant dream.

391
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:49,574
Yeah, okay.

392
00:27:52,129 --> 00:27:55,998
I can be done with the teeth,
the eyes or the mind. What am I?

393
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:02,796
I can be humorous,
but I'm never funny!

394
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:03,880
What am I?

395
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:11,930
Tell me where he is.

396
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,815
I am telling you!

397
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:16,814
You're just too stupid to figure it out!

398
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:22,524
- Miss Falcone, you've got a visitor.
- Kind of in the middle of something.

399
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:23,991
Guy's got Penguin.

400
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:27,820
Bring him in.

401
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,713
Well, this is unexpected.

402
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,678
Heard you were looking for Penguin.

403
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:51,602
He never was a great boss.

404
00:28:52,189 --> 00:28:53,475
Well, well, Oswald.

405
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:56,603
Is he alive in there?

406
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,395
Maybe.

407
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,491
I want $100,000.

408
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:09,487
Pay him.

409
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:20,919
I'm not even gonna ask.

410
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:24,131
Oh, by the way,
I found out where Penn is.

411
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:32,135
Take him to the docks, shoot him,
and throw him in the river.

412
00:29:33,397 --> 00:29:34,433
Watch Penguin.

413
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:36,931
Let's go get Mr. Penn.

414
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,783
Lovely, Miss Gonzalez, well done.

415
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:58,123
Pull a little harder. Right.

416
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,421
That's it, Miss McGee. Come on.

417
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,799
What fresh level of hell is this?

418
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:10,719
Who is hungry?

419
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:16,475
GCPD!

420
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,602
GCPD!

421
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:22,314
We're looking for Arthur Penn.

422
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,145
What are you doing?

423
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:26,697
Anonymity is a strict edict here
at the resort.

424
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:28,149
I bet.

425
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,623
- That's him.
- Penn. Penn!

426
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:38,743
Oh, no.

427
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,249
Let's take a walk.

428
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:47,835
As you were.

429
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,706
Mr. Cobblepot.

430
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:20,160
You are working for her, too!

431
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,461
- I assure you...
- Of course you are!

432
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,330
Where is she?

433
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:26,799
- You don't understand.
- Where is she?

434
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:38,349
- Is it done?
- Sofia left before I could kill her.

435
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,054
She's on her way to stop Gordon.

436
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,057
<i>Meet me at the Spa Bosh Sumka,
and we will kill her together.</i>

437
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:55,952
Nygma was here?

438
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:00,075
Miss Falcone tried to get him
to turn on you.

439
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:01,367
What?

440
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,748
He endured a tremendous amount of pain.

441
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:06,835
He wouldn't give you up.

442
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:10,751
Where is he now?

443
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:14,756
Her thugs took him to the docks
to kill him.

444
00:32:25,569 --> 00:32:30,610
I have worked for Don Falcone
for years, before Mr. Cobblepot.

445
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:33,157
When Sofia came to Gotham,

446
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:37,278
Don Falcone asked me
to keep an eye on his daughter.

447
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,029
She found out.

448
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:43,705
So you made another deal with her,
you weaselly, triple agent, you.

449
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,787
It's how you stay alive
in this business.

450
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:47,872
And she let me live.

451
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:53,128
As long as I informed to her
about Mr. Cobblepot.

452
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:57,139
That's how she was able to stay
one step ahead of Penguin,

453
00:32:57,225 --> 00:32:58,341
with inside information.

454
00:32:58,935 --> 00:32:59,971
Then what?

455
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,553
She asked me to put her
in touch with Lazlo Valentine.

456
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:04,263
The Pyg.

457
00:33:05,192 --> 00:33:06,182
So I did.

458
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:09,068
But I told Don Falcone right away.

459
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:11,275
All right, you're coming with us.

460
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,026
We need your statement for the record.

461
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,192
Get down!

462
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:40,008
Get Penn out of here.
He's all that matters.

463
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:41,808
We've got to get you to the hospital.

464
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:43,394
Gunshot would draw attention.

465
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,185
The cops will be here soon.
I can make it till they arrive.

466
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,983
James Gordon.

467
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:54,355
We could've had a good thing, you and I.

468
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:59,118
You just had to go and ruin it.

469
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,070
Go.

470
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:03,072
That's an order.

471
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:11,589
Get Penn.

472
00:34:11,675 --> 00:34:12,836
Get Gordon.

473
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,172
Get out!

474
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:55,545
Lee!

475
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:58,469
- Where's Sofia?
- In there with Jim.

476
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:02,340
- Take the car.
- He's hurt bad.

477
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:03,549
Get in.

478
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:21,488
Can't catch a break today.

479
00:35:23,038 --> 00:35:24,074
Let's go get a milkshake.

480
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,751
Jim, you really are
such a disappointment.

481
00:35:41,014 --> 00:35:46,260
Would it have been so bad,
being in the palm of my hands,

482
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:49,221
having me chip away
at your soul little by little?

483
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:54,897
Was it so important
to rob me of my revenge?

484
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,193
That hurt.

485
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:03,276
It wasn't about me.

486
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,908
I wasn't going to give you the GCPD.

487
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:09,532
Of course, it was about you.

488
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,076
Your pride, your arrogance.

489
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,295
Do you think that what I was asking for

490
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:18,750
was any different than
what my father had for 30 years?

491
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,761
You mean your father who you killed?

492
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:24,880
Yes.

493
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:26,723
I killed him,

494
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:30,018
because he disappointed me.

495
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:32,638
Just like you.

496
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:41,151
You know, Jim,
oddly enough, I still care for you.

497
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:47,536
Beg me for your life.
Ask for forgiveness.

498
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:50,706
And we can start over.

499
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,870
Sofia...

500
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:03,419
Go to hell.

501
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,177
James Gordon,

502
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:16,895
this is where our story ends.

503
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:29,536
- You.
- Yeah.

504
00:37:31,166 --> 00:37:32,156
Me.

505
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:45,377
Stay with me, Jim.

506
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,013
Jim, can you hear me?

507
00:37:56,858 --> 00:37:58,099
Come on, now. Come on.

508
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:02,437
Hey, I've got a riddle for you.

509
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:05,064
What's got a bullet in its head
and sinks to the bottom of the river?

510
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:08,029
You.

511
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,405
The real torture

512
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:13,156
is that those idiotic horns
will be the last I ever hear.

513
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:16,287
Just do it!

514
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:25,459
Oswald.

515
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,212
How?

516
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:30,760
Did you already kill Sofia?

517
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:35,932
No. She left the mansion
to pursue Jim Gordon.

518
00:38:37,357 --> 00:38:38,689
Why didn't you just stay at the home,

519
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,816
wait till she came there and killed her?

520
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:43,985
Then I wouldn't have been here on time.

521
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,985
You gave up your revenge for me?

522
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,622
Trust is so very hard to find in Gotham.

523
00:39:02,382 --> 00:39:03,964
But I trust you, Ed.

524
00:39:27,949 --> 00:39:29,440
I have a strong desire

525
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:32,944
to never ever see this pier again.

526
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,120
I agree.

527
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:56,174
Hey.

528
00:39:57,729 --> 00:39:58,719
Hey.

529
00:39:59,022 --> 00:40:00,308
Surprised you're alive?

530
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,182
Yeah.

531
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:09,233
- How?
- How do you think?

532
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:11,565
Lee.

533
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,322
She kept you alive
till the medics got there.

534
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,697
Even one-handed,
she's a damn good doctor.

535
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,287
- Sofia?
- In a coma.

536
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,497
Amazing she's not dead.

537
00:40:31,304 --> 00:40:32,294
Harvey.

538
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,299
When I get out of here,
I'm going to confess.

539
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:42,813
My connection to Sofia,
my role with the Pyg. All of it.

540
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,019
I gotta come clean.

541
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:47,601
No.

542
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,770
What do you mean?

543
00:40:50,657 --> 00:40:52,740
Who would benefit from that? You.

544
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,528
You get to be the martyr,
feel better about yourself.

545
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:00,698
The GCPD loses its hero. No!

546
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,083
You want to pay your debt?

547
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,498
You live with it.

548
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:08,538
Just like I do.

549
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:14,128
So, Sofia wins after all?

550
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:18,216
It's what the city needs.

551
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:24,763
Where's Lee?

552
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:27,770
She went back to The Narrows.

553
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,901
Said she had unfinished business.

554
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,741
- Not so tough now.
- Get him!

555
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,326
- Yes! Come on!
- You got him!

556
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:49,955
All right.

557
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:53,049
I'll go. I'll go.

558
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:54,961
Oh, I know you'll go.

559
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:57,341
Just not yet.

560
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:00,757
Hold his hand.

561
00:42:01,728 --> 00:42:03,185
No. No!

562
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,596
No!

563
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:08,144
What are you doing? No! No!

564
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:10,646
No!

565
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,778
Stop! Don't!

566
00:42:31,174 --> 00:42:33,211
With Sofia gone,
Penguin's gonna try and take control

567
00:42:33,301 --> 00:42:35,338
of Gotham again,
maybe even try and kill us.

568
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:37,465
Could you just give me a second?

569
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:40,055
Barbara, we have to act.

570
00:42:40,141 --> 00:42:42,349
- We can't just stand around...
- I said shut up!
