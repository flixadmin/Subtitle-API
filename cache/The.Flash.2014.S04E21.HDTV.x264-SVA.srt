1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,336
- Previously on "The Flash"...
- Council of Wells.

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:04,431
Some of the brightest
minds in all the multiverse.

3
00:00:04,434 --> 00:00:07,351
There's still another cryogenic
anomaly in my DNA.

4
00:00:07,354 --> 00:00:08,801
Killer Frost is still a part of you.

5
00:00:08,804 --> 00:00:10,465
The more I try to use my brain,

6
00:00:10,468 --> 00:00:11,992
the sooner I'm going to lose it.

7
00:00:11,995 --> 00:00:14,335
- They know what DeVoe's doing.
- Separate satellites working

8
00:00:14,337 --> 00:00:15,726
together for a single purpose?

9
00:00:15,729 --> 00:00:17,229
DeVoe wants to remove the intelligence

10
00:00:17,231 --> 00:00:18,270
of everyone on Earth?

11
00:00:18,273 --> 00:00:19,301
Just like mine.

12
00:00:29,476 --> 00:00:31,109
Iris?

13
00:00:31,111 --> 00:00:33,226
Sorry, babe! Go back to sleep.

14
00:00:44,691 --> 00:00:45,991
Iris...

15
00:00:45,993 --> 00:00:47,023
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

16
00:00:47,026 --> 00:00:48,640
Just one second. Let me just...

17
00:00:48,643 --> 00:00:51,762
Let me just get this
last sentence down, okay?

18
00:00:51,765 --> 00:00:54,032
Why... why are you still
awake? What is all this?

19
00:00:54,034 --> 00:00:55,820
This is...

20
00:00:55,823 --> 00:00:58,235
every file, every report, every footnote

21
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:00,122
that I could find on
DeVoe. I dug it all up

22
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:01,360
when I woke up in the
middle of the night.

23
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:03,874
I just... I couldn't
stop thinking about DeVoe

24
00:01:03,877 --> 00:01:05,546
and his machine.

25
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:07,225
And now that he has
all of the satellites,

26
00:01:07,228 --> 00:01:09,162
I mean, he could turn on
the machine at any point.

27
00:01:09,164 --> 00:01:10,989
And not knowing is maddening,

28
00:01:10,992 --> 00:01:13,251
but at least I know
what he's planned, right?

29
00:01:13,253 --> 00:01:15,879
But everyone else in the
city, they are oblivious.

30
00:01:15,882 --> 00:01:19,157
Which is why I decided
that I need to write

31
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:21,192
a piece about it.

32
00:01:21,194 --> 00:01:24,484
- An article?
- Exposing every single detail

33
00:01:24,487 --> 00:01:25,764
of his maniacal plan.

34
00:01:25,766 --> 00:01:27,465
- Oh...
- I think that if people

35
00:01:27,467 --> 00:01:28,993
in this city knew what he was up to,

36
00:01:28,996 --> 00:01:30,629
then maybe they could
protect themselves.

37
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:31,970
Barry, I really think

38
00:01:31,972 --> 00:01:33,289
this is exactly what we need

39
00:01:33,292 --> 00:01:34,773
to change the tide against DeVoe.

40
00:01:34,775 --> 00:01:36,374
So I'm gonna go upstairs,

41
00:01:36,376 --> 00:01:37,598
I'm gonna take a shower,
and when I come back,

42
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,248
I need you to tell me
everything you know about

43
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,359
that flying chair

44
00:01:40,362 --> 00:01:42,713
and how he uses it to body hop and...

45
00:01:44,682 --> 00:01:48,789
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

46
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:52,457
So last night, Harry, Cisco, and I

47
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:54,092
were up all night writing
all the different algorithms

48
00:01:54,094 --> 00:01:55,335
we could think of involving

49
00:01:55,338 --> 00:01:56,995
the satellite tech that DeVoe stole.

50
00:01:56,997 --> 00:01:59,114
We think DeVoe plans to position each

51
00:01:59,117 --> 00:02:01,320
of his five satellites
at specifically calculated

52
00:02:01,323 --> 00:02:03,301
- points around the globe.
- And when the quantum computers

53
00:02:03,303 --> 00:02:04,703
in each satellite link up...

54
00:02:04,705 --> 00:02:07,505
He'll use that network to basically emit

55
00:02:07,508 --> 00:02:09,082
a series of dark matter bursts.

56
00:02:09,085 --> 00:02:11,184
That will reboot the pre-frontal cortex

57
00:02:11,187 --> 00:02:13,539
of every man, woman,
and child on this Earth.

58
00:02:13,542 --> 00:02:15,379
Well, we need to nip this in the bud.

59
00:02:15,382 --> 00:02:17,115
We can't let him
launch those satellites.

60
00:02:17,117 --> 00:02:19,551
Yeah, but I mean, how are
we supposed to find him?

61
00:02:19,553 --> 00:02:21,019
I mean, we haven't been able to register

62
00:02:21,021 --> 00:02:23,054
DeVoe's pocket dimension
energy for days.

63
00:02:23,056 --> 00:02:24,687
And with Null's gravitational powers,

64
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,991
he can launch these satellites
from any place at any time.

65
00:02:27,994 --> 00:02:29,527
Yeah, he can.

66
00:02:29,529 --> 00:02:30,995
What are you thinking, Bar?

67
00:02:30,997 --> 00:02:32,458
I think we shoot 'em down.

68
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:34,661
- Whoa.
- There is one small problem.

69
00:02:34,664 --> 00:02:36,868
DeVoe has Kilgore's powers.

70
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,070
Yeah, he can manipulate
any tech-based weapon

71
00:02:39,072 --> 00:02:40,105
we fire at him.

72
00:02:40,107 --> 00:02:42,340
So we don't use tech.

73
00:02:42,342 --> 00:02:44,909
We use some kind of
organic matter weapon.

74
00:02:44,911 --> 00:02:47,078
Right, like a...

75
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:49,015
Like a...

76
00:02:49,018 --> 00:02:51,448
You know what? Let's split up,

77
00:02:51,451 --> 00:02:53,284
see what we can find.

78
00:02:56,089 --> 00:02:57,687
Ramon.

79
00:02:59,924 --> 00:03:02,592
DeVoe's not acting.
Why is he not acting?

80
00:03:02,595 --> 00:03:04,809
I don't know, but it doesn't matter.

81
00:03:04,812 --> 00:03:07,565
But it does matter, though.
And if I had my intelligence,

82
00:03:07,567 --> 00:03:09,200
I could figure that out. But I don't.

83
00:03:09,202 --> 00:03:10,702
- I got to get it back.
- No, no, no.

84
00:03:10,704 --> 00:03:12,370
What you need to do is be patient.

85
00:03:12,372 --> 00:03:13,705
We're consulting with, like,

86
00:03:13,707 --> 00:03:15,179
literally every scientist we know.

87
00:03:15,182 --> 00:03:16,473
Why don't you consult with me?

88
00:03:16,476 --> 00:03:17,942
No. Harry...

89
00:03:17,944 --> 00:03:22,013
No, not dumb me, the other mes.

90
00:03:23,517 --> 00:03:25,049
The council.

91
00:03:25,051 --> 00:03:27,840
So I must admit, found your transmission

92
00:03:27,843 --> 00:03:29,898
intriguing, to say the least.

93
00:03:29,901 --> 00:03:31,722
But first...

94
00:03:31,725 --> 00:03:35,193
I have a question for you, Harry Wells.

95
00:03:35,195 --> 00:03:38,763
Tell me, Harry, how does
your "hypothetica"

96
00:03:38,765 --> 00:03:40,899
thinking cap account for

97
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:44,602
the resonant inductive coupling
of the dark matter transfer?

98
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:48,540
- Well, the... the inductive...
- Am I speaking to you?

99
00:03:48,542 --> 00:03:50,742
I cannot remember. Oh, wait. I'm not.

100
00:03:50,744 --> 00:03:53,445
The little guy that must be
Cisco, put you in the box.

101
00:03:53,447 --> 00:03:54,779
Put the box in the pocket.

102
00:03:54,781 --> 00:03:56,414
Talking to Harry, a simple question.

103
00:03:56,416 --> 00:04:01,786
How does it account for
the resonant coupling?

104
00:04:01,788 --> 00:04:04,088
It, uh...

105
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,824
Ah!

106
00:04:05,826 --> 00:04:09,661
Ha! I knew it! He doesn't know!

107
00:04:09,663 --> 00:04:11,529
He doesn't know!

108
00:04:11,531 --> 00:04:16,106
Ah! Simple Harry is
truly Simple Harry now.

109
00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:18,203
- No. That's not what's hap...
- Ja, remember,

110
00:04:18,205 --> 00:04:19,737
I put you in the box.
Put the box in the pocket.

111
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:22,484
Crush the box! In the pocket.

112
00:04:22,487 --> 00:04:24,186
This is very simple what has happened.

113
00:04:24,189 --> 00:04:27,612
Your "hypothetical" thinking
cap has malfunctioned, hmm,

114
00:04:27,614 --> 00:04:30,982
and left the world's
once formidable intellect

115
00:04:30,984 --> 00:04:32,757
a dum-dum!

116
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,054
- That's not what happened.
- Yeah, that's what happened.

117
00:04:35,057 --> 00:04:36,657
That's what happened.

118
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,960
Poor Harry.

119
00:04:38,963 --> 00:04:40,413
- Herr Wells...
- Ja.

120
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:44,050
Are you gonna help us or not?

121
00:04:44,053 --> 00:04:45,630
- Not.
- Why not?

122
00:04:45,632 --> 00:04:48,333
The Council of Wells is a council

123
00:04:48,335 --> 00:04:51,769
of superior intellects
there to accept the challenge

124
00:04:51,771 --> 00:04:54,559
of others with superior intellects.

125
00:04:54,562 --> 00:04:56,140
It's called the Council of Wells

126
00:04:56,142 --> 00:04:57,809
and not the Council of Dum-Dums!

127
00:04:57,811 --> 00:04:59,244
- Loot at this man.
- I see him.

128
00:04:59,246 --> 00:05:00,845
Is he not one of your own?

129
00:05:00,847 --> 00:05:02,814
Are you telling me you're gonna betray

130
00:05:02,816 --> 00:05:05,450
one of your own because
he doesn't meet some

131
00:05:05,452 --> 00:05:07,685
arbitrary intellectual standard?

132
00:05:07,687 --> 00:05:09,194
Ah! So you do understand.

133
00:05:09,197 --> 00:05:11,688
Ja, unlike your
simple friend, here's what you

134
00:05:11,691 --> 00:05:14,859
now must consider.

135
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:17,195
Auf Wiedersehen!

136
00:05:17,197 --> 00:05:20,064
No, he's right. I am a dum-dum.

137
00:05:20,066 --> 00:05:22,066
Hey, you are not a dum-dum.

138
00:05:22,068 --> 00:05:23,929
Ramon, come on. Let's face facts.

139
00:05:23,932 --> 00:05:25,969
I've lost most of my
science, lost most of my math.

140
00:05:25,972 --> 00:05:27,605
Language will be next,
and there's nothing

141
00:05:27,607 --> 00:05:30,551
- we can do about it.
- On the contrary, "mon frery"

142
00:05:30,554 --> 00:05:33,027
we're the ones who created
that council of ding-dongs

143
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,980
in the first place, so if
they're not gonna help us,

144
00:05:35,982 --> 00:05:37,849
that leaves us with one other option.

145
00:05:37,851 --> 00:05:42,220
A new council, a smarter council.

146
00:05:42,222 --> 00:05:43,855
A better council.

147
00:05:45,859 --> 00:05:47,525
- Hey, Caitlin.
- Hmm?

148
00:05:47,527 --> 00:05:49,427
Do you have any ibuprofen?

149
00:05:49,429 --> 00:05:51,663
Reading up on all this organic matter

150
00:05:51,665 --> 00:05:53,631
has given me an organic migraine.

151
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:55,733
Oh, thanks.

152
00:05:57,812 --> 00:05:59,304
You have a little...

153
00:05:59,306 --> 00:06:00,872
Oh! Acupuncture.

154
00:06:00,874 --> 00:06:02,373
Ever since I found out I still have

155
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,075
a cryogenic anomaly in my DNA,

156
00:06:04,077 --> 00:06:07,045
I've been doing every
medical avenue I can think of

157
00:06:07,047 --> 00:06:08,646
to get Killer Frost to emerge.

158
00:06:08,648 --> 00:06:10,582
Mm. You really do miss her, don't you?

159
00:06:10,584 --> 00:06:12,517
Yeah. Killer Frost was a part of me,

160
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:14,252
and just as I was
starting to accept her,

161
00:06:14,254 --> 00:06:16,187
she was taken away.

162
00:06:16,189 --> 00:06:17,488
I'm running out of ideas.

163
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:20,358
Hmm, well, I know it's not

164
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,038
exactly the same, but I've had

165
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,746
my fair share of missing persons cases.

166
00:06:24,749 --> 00:06:26,898
And what do you do
when you've hit a wall?

167
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,802
I try to attack it from
a different direction.

168
00:06:30,804 --> 00:06:33,838
If that helps. Anyway, thanks.

169
00:06:39,746 --> 00:06:42,046
We've been attacking this
from the wrong direction.

170
00:06:42,048 --> 00:06:45,098
We know we need a tech-free projectile

171
00:06:45,101 --> 00:06:47,168
to stop DeVoe's satellites,
so we've been looking

172
00:06:47,171 --> 00:06:51,122
for an object when what
we really need is a person.

173
00:06:51,124 --> 00:06:53,224
Amunet.

174
00:06:53,226 --> 00:06:54,562
- Amunet Black?
- I know she's not

175
00:06:54,565 --> 00:06:56,994
the ideal choice, but
Amunet's psychic-powered

176
00:06:56,997 --> 00:06:59,335
alnico shards are not
only deadly powerful.

177
00:06:59,338 --> 00:07:02,285
They're completely immune
to DeVoe's Kilgore powers.

178
00:07:02,288 --> 00:07:05,470
Not ideal? I mean, she kidnapped you.

179
00:07:05,472 --> 00:07:07,491
She tried to sell me into meta slavery.

180
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:09,707
And she ruined my
bachelorette party, I mean...

181
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,227
- That's not...
- I mean, you're right.

182
00:07:11,229 --> 00:07:12,910
It's... it's admittedly not
as big of a deal, but you know

183
00:07:12,912 --> 00:07:14,278
- what I'm saying.
- Yeah, we can't partner up

184
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,347
with Amunet. She's a criminal.

185
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:18,216
Snart's a criminal. So's Killer Frost.

186
00:07:18,218 --> 00:07:20,151
We worked with them.

187
00:07:20,153 --> 00:07:23,187
Look, even if we forgave Amunet

188
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:26,444
for everything she's
done... Which is a lot.

189
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:28,314
What makes you say she'd
be willing to help us?

190
00:07:28,317 --> 00:07:29,693
I've seen a different side of her.

191
00:07:29,696 --> 00:07:30,995
She's helped me before,

192
00:07:30,997 --> 00:07:33,164
and I believe she'll do it again.

193
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,181
This isn't what I expected
Amunet's hideout to look like.

194
00:07:50,183 --> 00:07:52,316
I might have made a few changes.

195
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,924
Really, boys?

196
00:07:57,819 --> 00:08:00,625
You trying to get us killed?
That's The Flash, you morons.

197
00:08:00,627 --> 00:08:03,294
And Caitlin may look like a librarian,

198
00:08:03,296 --> 00:08:05,530
but she's a coldhearted beast.

199
00:08:05,533 --> 00:08:06,863
Where's Amunet?

200
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:10,902
Really? No, "Hello, Norvock.

201
00:08:10,904 --> 00:08:13,171
How you been?" You're not even gonna

202
00:08:13,173 --> 00:08:15,506
introduce me to your new boss?

203
00:08:15,508 --> 00:08:17,608
Oh, I'm not her boss. I'm just a friend.

204
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,143
Well, isn't that sweet?

205
00:08:19,145 --> 00:08:21,345
Norvock, where's Amunet?

206
00:08:21,347 --> 00:08:23,281
No one's heard a peep
from her in months.

207
00:08:23,283 --> 00:08:26,804
For all I know, the witch is dead.

208
00:08:31,966 --> 00:08:33,497
So Amunet's gone?

209
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,962
Well, apparently after her
deal with Warden Wolfe took

210
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:38,561
a nosedive, she's been out of
the meta trafficking business.

211
00:08:38,564 --> 00:08:40,189
Caitlin, do you know
any personal details

212
00:08:40,192 --> 00:08:41,482
that can help us track her down?

213
00:08:41,484 --> 00:08:43,247
Oh, I don't know. Amunet's always been

214
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,251
a private person, sort
of unpredictable and rash,

215
00:08:46,254 --> 00:08:49,390
kind of fly by the seat of your pants.

216
00:08:50,527 --> 00:08:52,126
You know, when she kidnapped
me at Christmas, she said

217
00:08:52,128 --> 00:08:53,661
she used to be a flight attendant.

218
00:08:53,663 --> 00:08:54,927
I think she was on an airplane the night

219
00:08:54,929 --> 00:08:56,598
the particle accelerator exploded.

220
00:08:56,601 --> 00:08:59,969
Okay, that we can work with. Let's see.

221
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,670
Yeah, it looks like there
were 35 flights in the air

222
00:09:02,672 --> 00:09:03,771
in Central City the night of the

223
00:09:03,773 --> 00:09:05,340
particle accelerator explosion.

224
00:09:05,342 --> 00:09:07,369
Cisco, can you access
the flight manifests?

225
00:09:07,372 --> 00:09:10,011
Yes, I can, and I can take
the cruise credentials...

226
00:09:10,013 --> 00:09:11,623
Cross-reference them in
the facial recognition?

227
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:12,853
Can you not read my mind?

228
00:09:15,718 --> 00:09:18,548
- Huh.
- Her real name is Leslie Jocoy?

229
00:09:18,551 --> 00:09:20,021
Maybe she's operating
under her real name,

230
00:09:20,023 --> 00:09:21,599
- not her pseudonym.
- Well, she didn't have

231
00:09:21,601 --> 00:09:23,291
a criminal record until
the particle accelerator,

232
00:09:23,293 --> 00:09:25,593
- so... it's not a bad plan.
- Right.

233
00:09:25,595 --> 00:09:27,829
CCPD's database has several

234
00:09:27,831 --> 00:09:29,597
prior work addresses for Leslie Jocoy.

235
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,967
All right, let's pay 'em all a visit.

236
00:09:30,969 --> 00:09:32,570
Okay. Dad why don't you
and Caitlin go check out

237
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,402
- the most recent address?
- I'll check out the rest.

238
00:09:34,404 --> 00:09:36,199
- Sounds like a plan.
- And I should get back

239
00:09:36,202 --> 00:09:37,638
to the loft. I need
to pick up a DeVoe file

240
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,006
- for my article...
- Hey, actually,

241
00:09:39,008 --> 00:09:41,476
can I just talk to you really quick?

242
00:09:41,478 --> 00:09:43,863
Um, yeah. Okay.

243
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:46,844
Just about your article.
I just think maybe

244
00:09:46,847 --> 00:09:50,184
telling everybody about
a meta-human uber-genius

245
00:09:50,186 --> 00:09:52,711
who plans on rebooting
people's brains...

246
00:09:52,714 --> 00:09:54,489
Yeah, but if we don't tell them,

247
00:09:54,491 --> 00:09:56,758
they might find out when it's too late.

248
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,793
Sure, but I don't... I
mean, the team's always liked

249
00:09:58,795 --> 00:10:01,028
to keep what we're working on low-key.

250
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:03,064
Okay, well, I'll run the idea by them.

251
00:10:03,066 --> 00:10:05,400
No. I-I don't mean no. I just mean...

252
00:10:05,402 --> 00:10:09,504
maybe hold off until
you finish writing it.

253
00:10:09,506 --> 00:10:11,939
Okay. Yeah, I'll hold off.

254
00:10:11,941 --> 00:10:13,457
- You will?
- Yeah.

255
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,475
No, I mean, I get it.
We've never openly shared

256
00:10:15,478 --> 00:10:17,145
this kind of information
with the city before,

257
00:10:17,147 --> 00:10:19,680
and the team will be more
likely to agree with me

258
00:10:19,682 --> 00:10:21,716
if I have a full article
ready for them to read.

259
00:10:21,718 --> 00:10:24,485
So I am gonna hurry up and finish it.

260
00:10:24,487 --> 00:10:26,418
- Okay.
- Thanks.

261
00:10:28,391 --> 00:10:31,159
Harry, I give to you...

262
00:10:31,161 --> 00:10:34,061
the emotionally astute
Council of Harrisons.

263
00:10:34,063 --> 00:10:35,863
- Hey.
- There ya are.

264
00:10:35,866 --> 00:10:37,832
H. Wells, what... what
are you doing here?

265
00:10:37,834 --> 00:10:40,334
Those other stiffs, well, they got tired

266
00:10:40,336 --> 00:10:42,236
of my connections

267
00:10:42,238 --> 00:10:45,306
making me tardy to their party, so...

268
00:10:45,308 --> 00:10:46,841
They gave me the boot.

269
00:10:46,843 --> 00:10:48,743
Gave you the... wait,
so I'm not the only one?

270
00:10:48,745 --> 00:10:51,179
Nuh-uh, all of us been kicked out.

271
00:10:52,315 --> 00:10:53,581
All of you have been kick...

272
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,016
You got me a council of rejects.

273
00:10:55,018 --> 00:10:56,217
Well, they're brilliant rejects.

274
00:10:56,219 --> 00:10:57,441
'Ey! Oh, whoa, whoa!

275
00:10:57,444 --> 00:10:59,743
Who you calling rejects?
'Ey, look at this guy.

276
00:10:59,746 --> 00:11:01,255
What are you, sta-nuts?

277
00:11:01,257 --> 00:11:03,825
Allow myself to introduce myself.

278
00:11:03,827 --> 00:11:06,661
Sonny Wells. Earth-24.

279
00:11:06,663 --> 00:11:08,729
At your service. They
call me Sonny on account

280
00:11:08,731 --> 00:11:10,298
of my sunny disposition.

281
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,200
You know, I think that
name kind of works for him.

282
00:11:12,202 --> 00:11:15,036
'Ey, oh, the guy who must be Cisco.

283
00:11:15,038 --> 00:11:19,106
My motto, personally, for me, my motto?

284
00:11:19,108 --> 00:11:21,542
Be kind.

285
00:11:21,544 --> 00:11:23,311
Rewind.

286
00:11:23,314 --> 00:11:25,688
- Be kind. Rewind?
- They're still on VHS.

287
00:11:25,691 --> 00:11:27,715
What?

288
00:11:27,717 --> 00:11:30,284
Hello! Yes, bonjour.

289
00:11:30,286 --> 00:11:34,856
So I am Harrison H.P.
Wells, the Earth-25.

290
00:11:34,858 --> 00:11:38,459
So I must say that it warms me

291
00:11:38,461 --> 00:11:41,505
to see us all bonded by
our faces and our hearts.

292
00:11:41,508 --> 00:11:42,608
You see his scarf? I like that scarf.

293
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:43,743
Gonna get myself one of them

294
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:45,533
classy scarves like this guy.

295
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,835
That's a $10 scarf right there.

296
00:11:47,837 --> 00:11:50,271
So anyway, without further ado,

297
00:11:50,273 --> 00:11:53,071
it's time for me to
commence this meeting

298
00:11:53,074 --> 00:11:56,110
with one of my poems, so... allez.

299
00:11:56,112 --> 00:11:58,212
I never knew you.

300
00:11:58,214 --> 00:12:00,681
- I never taste you.
- Mm, taste.

301
00:12:00,683 --> 00:12:02,483
Never smelled you.

302
00:12:02,485 --> 00:12:07,288
Until I do. And now I am hooked-ed.

303
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:10,091
Mm, saucy.

304
00:12:10,093 --> 00:12:13,060
And, uh, what is this poem about?

305
00:12:13,062 --> 00:12:14,883
- Bread.
- Oh, deep connection.

306
00:12:14,886 --> 00:12:17,598
Food can feed the soul. You know, I once

307
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,567
had this experience
with a hot apple pie...

308
00:12:19,569 --> 00:12:22,236
Okay, you know what?
That's enough sharing

309
00:12:22,238 --> 00:12:24,230
from this side of the
table. How about we let

310
00:12:24,233 --> 00:12:26,106
somebody else share?
Harry, you have the floor.

311
00:12:26,109 --> 00:12:27,308
- No chance.
- Harry.

312
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,542
- No way.
- Come on.

313
00:12:28,545 --> 00:12:29,777
Do the intro.

314
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:31,441
Why? No.

315
00:12:31,444 --> 00:12:32,847
- I'm not gonna.
- Harry.

316
00:12:32,849 --> 00:12:34,027
- What?
- You have to do

317
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,650
the sharing if you
want the helping, okay?

318
00:12:36,653 --> 00:12:38,953
- Allez, Harry.
- 'Ey.

319
00:12:41,691 --> 00:12:43,668
- I'm Harry.
- How you doin', Harry?

320
00:12:43,671 --> 00:12:45,003
- Bonjour, Harry.
- Howdy, Harry.

321
00:12:45,006 --> 00:12:46,406
We know his name.

322
00:12:46,409 --> 00:12:48,162
So, uh...

323
00:12:48,164 --> 00:12:50,498
here's the thing.

324
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,966
I'm losing my intelligence.

325
00:12:51,968 --> 00:12:53,097
- Whoa!
- Oh, no.

326
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:56,436
And as Wellses, you
know how very important

327
00:12:56,439 --> 00:12:59,630
our intelligence is, and
so I'm asking for your help

328
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:02,081
to get my intelligence
back so I can kick some...

329
00:13:02,084 --> 00:13:04,779
So I can help my team.

330
00:13:04,781 --> 00:13:06,013
Will you help me do that?

331
00:13:06,015 --> 00:13:09,617
Non. Non, mais of course, Harry.

332
00:13:09,619 --> 00:13:11,619
Of course we will help
him. We will help you.

333
00:13:11,621 --> 00:13:14,560
Open your heart. We'll open your mind.

334
00:13:14,563 --> 00:13:16,365
Come on, let's do this.

335
00:13:18,261 --> 00:13:19,493
- Okay.
- Lovely.

336
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,474
Hey, Bar, we're at the market.

337
00:13:26,477 --> 00:13:27,977
We'll let you know if we find her.

338
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,980
- Copy that.
- Amunet used to work here?

339
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,806
What did she do, bag groceries?

340
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:33,796
At least it's not human trafficking.

341
00:13:35,678 --> 00:13:37,310
Let's look around.

342
00:13:39,049 --> 00:13:41,848
Hey, look, when I told you

343
00:13:41,851 --> 00:13:43,474
to look in a different direction

344
00:13:43,477 --> 00:13:45,477
to find your alter ego,

345
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,988
I didn't mean team up with a criminal.

346
00:13:47,991 --> 00:13:49,590
I know how that probably looks.

347
00:13:49,592 --> 00:13:51,258
Yeah, it looks like you want us to work

348
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,727
with Amunet Black so she can help you

349
00:13:52,729 --> 00:13:54,763
with your Killer Frost problem.

350
00:13:54,766 --> 00:13:56,597
I mean, why weren't you
up front with the team

351
00:13:56,599 --> 00:13:57,999
- about that?
- Because I thought

352
00:13:58,001 --> 00:14:00,635
they'd say no if I had my own reasons.

353
00:14:00,637 --> 00:14:04,071
Besides, I actually really
do think Amunet can help us

354
00:14:04,073 --> 00:14:06,007
and help me with my
Killer Frost problem.

355
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:07,875
Well, how exactly can she help you?

356
00:14:07,877 --> 00:14:09,910
Last year, when I was having
trouble getting a handle

357
00:14:09,912 --> 00:14:11,799
on Killer Frost, I went to her.

358
00:14:11,802 --> 00:14:14,081
She used a black market
piece of tech on me,

359
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:16,617
a splicer, helped me split Killer Frost.

360
00:14:16,619 --> 00:14:18,285
And you're hoping she
still has this tech.

361
00:14:18,287 --> 00:14:19,954
It worked before. It could work again.

362
00:14:19,956 --> 00:14:21,982
Well, Caitlin you got to tell the team.

363
00:14:45,748 --> 00:14:46,914
Damn.

364
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,582
Somebody saw "Molly's Game."

365
00:14:48,584 --> 00:14:49,713
Mm-hmm.

366
00:14:52,955 --> 00:14:55,412
Hang on a second.

367
00:15:00,496 --> 00:15:02,763
CCPD. This is an illegal operation.

368
00:15:02,765 --> 00:15:04,638
Everybody out of the room.

369
00:15:07,336 --> 00:15:09,670
Leslie.

370
00:15:09,672 --> 00:15:11,839
Caitie.

371
00:15:11,841 --> 00:15:13,874
Leave it to your crafty little brain

372
00:15:13,876 --> 00:15:16,644
to figure out my dark secret.

373
00:15:16,646 --> 00:15:18,193
What are you doing here?

374
00:15:18,196 --> 00:15:21,331
Calling your bluff. I
knew you were still alive.

375
00:15:21,334 --> 00:15:22,950
No one could kill me.

376
00:15:22,952 --> 00:15:24,919
What's with the accent?

377
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:27,979
It's part of my
disguise. Had to blend in.

378
00:15:27,982 --> 00:15:30,157
Now I'm just your
average American blonde

379
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:32,002
making an honest living.

380
00:15:32,005 --> 00:15:35,807
Well, a more honest living, yeah?

381
00:15:37,467 --> 00:15:39,893
Besides, you know what they say.

382
00:15:39,896 --> 00:15:43,037
A zebra never changes its stripes.

383
00:15:43,039 --> 00:15:44,939
Flash.

384
00:15:44,941 --> 00:15:48,309
Oh! Flash. You really do stop

385
00:15:48,311 --> 00:15:50,380
all the crime in the city, don't you?

386
00:15:52,482 --> 00:15:54,281
But not today.

387
00:16:08,397 --> 00:16:09,841
We're not here to fight.

388
00:16:12,135 --> 00:16:13,755
We need your help.

389
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:18,283
Oh, look!

390
00:16:18,286 --> 00:16:21,314
A little hidey-hole for your outfit.

391
00:16:21,317 --> 00:16:23,861
Hi, excuse me. You don't seem

392
00:16:23,864 --> 00:16:25,797
too concerned that
DeVoe is about to launch

393
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:27,666
a bunch of satellites into space

394
00:16:27,668 --> 00:16:29,101
that are gonna reset all of our brains.

395
00:16:29,103 --> 00:16:31,870
Oh, no, my dear. I
find it very troubling.

396
00:16:31,872 --> 00:16:34,639
The professor turning everyone
in the world into a dimwit

397
00:16:34,641 --> 00:16:37,008
is tragic.

398
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,810
It's brilliant.

399
00:16:38,812 --> 00:16:40,212
But tragic.

400
00:16:40,214 --> 00:16:41,713
So will you work with us?

401
00:16:41,715 --> 00:16:43,248
Help us stop DeVoe?

402
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,517
Just...

403
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,652
that thing...

404
00:16:47,654 --> 00:16:49,755
Why do you still have it on?

405
00:16:49,757 --> 00:16:52,023
My...

406
00:16:52,025 --> 00:16:54,092
It helps me protect my identity.

407
00:16:54,094 --> 00:16:55,744
No.

408
00:16:55,747 --> 00:16:57,862
It's doing a terrible job.

409
00:16:57,865 --> 00:16:59,798
- What?
- Yes, you see,

410
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:05,937
that stoic jawline, patrician profile.

411
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:08,607
You're so obviously
the speedster I tried

412
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:10,439
to procure from the warden.

413
00:17:10,442 --> 00:17:12,111
May he RIP.

414
00:17:16,845 --> 00:17:19,288
- Come on.
- I'm doing it.

415
00:17:22,256 --> 00:17:25,657
- Hello, handsome.
- Hello.

416
00:17:25,659 --> 00:17:28,794
To think I had The Flash in my grasp.

417
00:17:28,796 --> 00:17:31,730
What a pretty penny I could
have gotten for that sale.

418
00:17:31,732 --> 00:17:33,265
- Amunet.
- Yes.

419
00:17:33,267 --> 00:17:35,367
- Focus.
- Ah!

420
00:17:35,369 --> 00:17:37,235
Okay. So...

421
00:17:37,237 --> 00:17:39,538
On the one hand, I am more dictator

422
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,972
than team player.

423
00:17:40,974 --> 00:17:44,776
But on the other...
Professor DeVoe stupefying

424
00:17:44,778 --> 00:17:49,281
the planet would be bad for business.

425
00:17:49,283 --> 00:17:51,383
So I'll do it.

426
00:17:51,385 --> 00:17:53,785
Unfortunately, there is a but.

427
00:17:53,787 --> 00:17:55,587
There usually is one.

428
00:17:55,589 --> 00:17:57,956
You see, in life, I have found

429
00:17:57,958 --> 00:18:01,357
that bigger isn't always better.

430
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,775
But in this case...

431
00:18:02,778 --> 00:18:04,263
You need more shards
to take out something

432
00:18:04,265 --> 00:18:05,731
the size of a satellite.

433
00:18:05,734 --> 00:18:07,801
So where'd you get those?

434
00:18:07,804 --> 00:18:09,267
From the plane I was on the night

435
00:18:09,269 --> 00:18:11,338
the particle accelerator exploded.

436
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:12,600
They were in the cargo bay

437
00:18:12,603 --> 00:18:14,804
en route to a military facility.

438
00:18:14,807 --> 00:18:18,076
Which conveniently never made
it to its final destination.

439
00:18:18,078 --> 00:18:20,278
You see, normally I would just pop down

440
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,572
to my storage locker to
grab my big job stash,

441
00:18:22,575 --> 00:18:26,236
but last week, a naughty boy... or girl

442
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:28,345
or non-binary gendered individual...

443
00:18:28,348 --> 00:18:30,244
Snuck in and robbed the place.

444
00:18:30,247 --> 00:18:31,729
Yeah, well, we should
check out your storage unit.

445
00:18:31,731 --> 00:18:33,181
There might still be some clues.

446
00:18:33,184 --> 00:18:35,960
I think I have an old CSI
kit back at the apartment.

447
00:18:35,963 --> 00:18:38,730
Great. You guys are so good.

448
00:18:38,732 --> 00:18:41,689
Sorry, excuse me. Where are you going?

449
00:18:41,692 --> 00:18:44,468
To the kitchen for a spot of tea?

450
00:18:44,471 --> 00:18:46,838
Why don't I take you?

451
00:18:50,644 --> 00:18:52,310
Boy.

452
00:18:53,013 --> 00:18:56,530
Oh, you prepare food in here?

453
00:18:56,533 --> 00:18:58,250
It's not very sanitary.

454
00:18:58,252 --> 00:19:00,185
I wanted to talk to you alone.

455
00:19:00,187 --> 00:19:02,988
I didn't just bring you
here to help us stop DeVoe.

456
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:07,626
An ulterior motive.
How furtive and apropos.

457
00:19:07,628 --> 00:19:10,295
After all, why go through all the hassle

458
00:19:10,297 --> 00:19:12,397
of procuring me when Killer Frost

459
00:19:12,399 --> 00:19:14,733
could quite easily just ice blast

460
00:19:14,735 --> 00:19:16,835
those satellites down?

461
00:19:16,837 --> 00:19:18,803
Killer Frost is gone.
I haven't been able

462
00:19:18,805 --> 00:19:20,372
to get her to appear ever since DeVoe

463
00:19:20,374 --> 00:19:21,973
used one of his powers on her.

464
00:19:21,975 --> 00:19:24,042
Remember last year when I came to you

465
00:19:24,044 --> 00:19:26,678
because Killer Frost was taking over?

466
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,946
You fixed me.

467
00:19:27,948 --> 00:19:29,700
Mm.

468
00:19:31,084 --> 00:19:33,752
My transmodular genetic splicer.

469
00:19:33,754 --> 00:19:35,487
I need to use that splicer again.

470
00:19:35,489 --> 00:19:38,223
Caitie.

471
00:19:38,225 --> 00:19:40,592
One of the reasons why
I was so willing to help

472
00:19:40,594 --> 00:19:44,262
you and your friends with
your professor situation

473
00:19:44,264 --> 00:19:47,466
is because, well, quite literally...

474
00:19:47,469 --> 00:19:50,465
it also benefits me.

475
00:19:50,468 --> 00:19:55,958
But giving you my
splicer, not as beneficial.

476
00:19:56,751 --> 00:19:59,310
What if I make you a deal?

477
00:19:59,313 --> 00:20:01,146
You give me the splicer.

478
00:20:01,148 --> 00:20:04,749
Killer Frost and I
will do you one favor.

479
00:20:04,751 --> 00:20:07,953
Oh, that is a tempting offer.

480
00:20:07,955 --> 00:20:12,290
But unfortunately my splicer
was stashed right alongside

481
00:20:12,292 --> 00:20:13,592
my additional shards.

482
00:20:13,594 --> 00:20:15,894
In your ransacked storage unit.

483
00:20:15,896 --> 00:20:18,363
Okay, wherever we find your shards,

484
00:20:18,365 --> 00:20:19,898
we should also find the splicer.

485
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,100
- Ding, ding, ding.
- So do we have a deal?

486
00:20:22,102 --> 00:20:25,003
You'll give me the splicer
as soon as we recover it?

487
00:20:25,005 --> 00:20:27,572
I'll even tie a little bow on it.

488
00:20:27,574 --> 00:20:29,941
Ladies and gentlemen, hang
on to your wigs and keys.

489
00:20:29,943 --> 00:20:32,944
Here we go. Harry, turn to
him, the guy who must be Cisco.

490
00:20:32,946 --> 00:20:35,313
- Express yourself.
- Yes, it is best you commence

491
00:20:35,315 --> 00:20:37,983
- with the "I feel" statements.
- Mm.

492
00:20:37,985 --> 00:20:41,786
Wow, like "I feel a yearnin"
or "I feel aroused."

493
00:20:41,788 --> 00:20:43,488
Okay, how...

494
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,557
How is this gonna make
me smarter than DeVoe?

495
00:20:45,559 --> 00:20:46,925
'Ey! Again with DeVoe.

496
00:20:46,927 --> 00:20:48,727
Why you so hung up on this mamalooch?

497
00:20:48,729 --> 00:20:51,431
I think that DeVoe,
for you, this is a guy

498
00:20:51,434 --> 00:20:53,534
that has... well, he's like a leech

499
00:20:53,537 --> 00:20:56,334
upon you, sucking and sucking

500
00:20:56,336 --> 00:20:58,336
and sucking and sucking and sucking.

501
00:20:58,338 --> 00:21:01,473
And all you are left with... is doubt.

502
00:21:01,475 --> 00:21:04,107
I like that. Nature,
red in tooth and claw.

503
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,111
You know, they say to
understand a man's actions,

504
00:21:06,113 --> 00:21:07,479
you got to understand his heart.

505
00:21:07,481 --> 00:21:09,648
Oh, okay, question.

506
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:12,984
How do you understand the heart

507
00:21:12,986 --> 00:21:15,186
of a deranged maniac?

508
00:21:15,188 --> 00:21:17,455
That guy who must be Cisco
makes a good point here.

509
00:21:17,457 --> 00:21:19,391
Let's all close our eyes and...

510
00:21:19,393 --> 00:21:22,360
take a moment and imagine
that we are all sociopaths

511
00:21:22,362 --> 00:21:25,897
- trying to conquer the world.
- Ah, yes.

512
00:21:25,899 --> 00:21:27,599
What is...

513
00:21:29,703 --> 00:21:32,904
Oh, mais, Harry. Go on, allez.

514
00:21:32,906 --> 00:21:34,390
Put yourself in DeVoe's shoes.

515
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:36,026
Close your eyes, Harry.

516
00:21:42,015 --> 00:21:44,482
Now what do you see?

517
00:21:44,484 --> 00:21:46,518
What do you smell?

518
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,553
How do you feel?

519
00:21:48,555 --> 00:21:50,889
Dumb. Dumb.

520
00:21:50,891 --> 00:21:53,291
This is not making me any smarter.

521
00:21:53,293 --> 00:21:56,027
But aren't you smarter, Harry?

522
00:21:56,029 --> 00:21:57,829
You must channel your aggression

523
00:21:57,831 --> 00:21:59,197
into love.

524
00:21:59,199 --> 00:22:00,699
I feel like you're mocking me.

525
00:22:00,701 --> 00:22:03,468
Oh! An "I Feel"
statement! Winner, winner.

526
00:22:03,470 --> 00:22:06,037
All right, all right,
all right, progress!

527
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:08,840
- On that note...
- Wait, wait.

528
00:22:08,842 --> 00:22:10,461
We're not done here, are we?

529
00:22:10,464 --> 00:22:12,477
- Yeah, we're done,
- Yeah, we're done.

530
00:22:12,479 --> 00:22:14,713
- Oui, oui, c'est fini.
- No, no, no.

531
00:22:14,715 --> 00:22:17,115
- Nothing's fini.
- Now, Harry...

532
00:22:17,117 --> 00:22:18,983
You know what they say
about all work and no play.

533
00:22:18,985 --> 00:22:20,585
Leaves no time for making whoopee.

534
00:22:21,855 --> 00:22:23,711
And there he goes.

535
00:22:23,714 --> 00:22:25,614
Look, H.P., come on, we're not done.

536
00:22:25,617 --> 00:22:28,393
- We haven't done anything.
- Non, non, mon frère, désolé.

537
00:22:28,395 --> 00:22:31,696
Parting, such sweet sorrow,
but I must bid you adieu.

538
00:22:31,698 --> 00:22:34,117
Harry from Earth-2, adieu.

539
00:22:35,535 --> 00:22:38,470
'Ey, Harry, everything you need...

540
00:22:38,472 --> 00:22:39,838
you got it right in there.

541
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,775
Remember, you're unbelievable.

542
00:22:43,777 --> 00:22:46,878
Ramon, remind me again...

543
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:51,258
what's... what's another
word for "huge"?

544
00:22:51,261 --> 00:22:52,994
"Colossal."

545
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,818
Colossal. Great, thank you.

546
00:22:54,821 --> 00:22:59,687
This... was a colossal waste of time!

547
00:23:10,837 --> 00:23:12,170
Here we are.

548
00:23:12,172 --> 00:23:14,839
This is where you kept your stash?

549
00:23:14,841 --> 00:23:18,023
Well, I got something.

550
00:23:18,026 --> 00:23:20,560
Some kind of substance on the lock pin.

551
00:23:20,563 --> 00:23:23,248
Looks like they applied
it to break the door open.

552
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:26,918
Young man, David Caruso's
got nothing on you.

553
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,153
Thanks.

554
00:23:34,628 --> 00:23:35,994
What is it?

555
00:23:35,996 --> 00:23:38,742
Acid? Cyanide?

556
00:23:38,745 --> 00:23:40,509
Oh, oh! Is it anthrax?

557
00:23:43,316 --> 00:23:45,283
Hematoxic venom.

558
00:23:47,574 --> 00:23:52,544
Oh, that grotty, manky,
plug-ugly prat dare betray me?

559
00:23:52,546 --> 00:23:54,679
I take it she knows who did this.

560
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:57,182
Yep, and so do you.

561
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:59,217
- Norvock.
- And I guarantee

562
00:23:59,219 --> 00:24:02,195
that snake for brains will suffer.

563
00:24:07,367 --> 00:24:09,467
If Norvock thinks he can steal from me

564
00:24:09,469 --> 00:24:11,886
and get away with it, he
has got another thing coming.

565
00:24:11,889 --> 00:24:13,328
I can't believe this is happening.

566
00:24:13,331 --> 00:24:15,606
Satellite's not picking
up any of your alnico metal

567
00:24:15,609 --> 00:24:17,775
anywhere in the city.
Norvock may be a moron,

568
00:24:17,777 --> 00:24:19,277
but he's not stupid enough to keep

569
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,279
the stash out in the open.

570
00:24:21,281 --> 00:24:23,681
- Hey, did you find anything?
- Nope.

571
00:24:23,683 --> 00:24:25,683
Norvock and the boxers
weren't at the ring anymore.

572
00:24:25,685 --> 00:24:26,979
Of course not!

573
00:24:26,982 --> 00:24:28,586
Because you and your gang
of heroes tipped him off

574
00:24:28,588 --> 00:24:30,136
that something was up.

575
00:24:30,139 --> 00:24:31,636
Have you expanded the satellite

576
00:24:31,639 --> 00:24:32,823
beyond Central City?

577
00:24:32,826 --> 00:24:34,225
- Yeah.
- What about trying

578
00:24:34,227 --> 00:24:36,027
- facial recognition?
- Yes, of course.

579
00:24:36,029 --> 00:24:37,428
And what about a geological scan

580
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,063
of the metal signature like last time

581
00:24:39,065 --> 00:24:41,099
or having Cisco run
another algorithm to check

582
00:24:41,101 --> 00:24:42,500
the electromagnetic fields in the city?

583
00:24:42,502 --> 00:24:44,402
Yes, Caitlin. I've done all that.

584
00:24:44,404 --> 00:24:45,970
I've run all the tests.

585
00:24:45,972 --> 00:24:47,597
Bit testy with that, Frost. Just...

586
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,207
We're doing everything
we can, all right?

587
00:24:49,209 --> 00:24:53,211
We're gonna find Norvock and the shards.

588
00:24:53,213 --> 00:24:55,013
Caitlin.

589
00:24:55,015 --> 00:24:57,749
Is this about her stolen shards...

590
00:24:57,751 --> 00:25:00,251
or her tech?

591
00:25:00,253 --> 00:25:02,086
What? What tech?

592
00:25:04,958 --> 00:25:07,018
Amunet has splicer
technology that she used

593
00:25:07,021 --> 00:25:08,825
to split Killer Frost last year.

594
00:25:08,828 --> 00:25:11,162
I was hoping to use it
again to get Killer Frost

595
00:25:11,164 --> 00:25:12,564
to come out, but...

596
00:25:12,566 --> 00:25:14,464
it was hidden with her metal shards

597
00:25:14,467 --> 00:25:15,900
in the storage container.

598
00:25:15,903 --> 00:25:18,403
Why wouldn't you tell us that?

599
00:25:18,406 --> 00:25:20,339
Because I made Amunet a deal.

600
00:25:20,342 --> 00:25:21,942
If she helped me, Killer Frost would do

601
00:25:21,945 --> 00:25:23,745
another job for her.

602
00:25:23,748 --> 00:25:25,742
Well, that splicer tech
isn't your only hope.

603
00:25:25,745 --> 00:25:27,745
Yes, it is, Joe. I have tried everything

604
00:25:27,747 --> 00:25:29,647
that I can think of to
get Killer Frost to appear,

605
00:25:29,649 --> 00:25:31,349
and that was my last shot.

606
00:25:31,351 --> 00:25:33,143
So now she's gone for good.

607
00:25:41,828 --> 00:25:44,996
Those weirdos with their feelings.

608
00:25:44,998 --> 00:25:46,948
I'm done talking about my feelings.

609
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,307
What's your problem?

610
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:53,243
No, it just looked
like you were gonna...

611
00:25:53,246 --> 00:25:54,480
What is this? What are you doing?

612
00:25:54,482 --> 00:25:56,340
I am cleaning up my work station

613
00:25:56,343 --> 00:25:57,809
because I'm not gonna need
it anymore since I'm not

614
00:25:57,811 --> 00:25:59,344
getting my intelligence back.

615
00:25:59,346 --> 00:26:00,929
You don't know that.

616
00:26:00,932 --> 00:26:02,880
I don't know that?
Oh, I don't know that?

617
00:26:02,882 --> 00:26:05,018
Ramon, what's done is done.

618
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:07,089
You spent all this time
bringing this council together

619
00:26:07,091 --> 00:26:08,892
when your time should have
been used helping the team.

620
00:26:08,894 --> 00:26:12,495
I wasted your valuable
time, and for that...

621
00:26:12,498 --> 00:26:13,931
I apologize.

622
00:26:18,465 --> 00:26:21,232
What are you... What?

623
00:26:21,234 --> 00:26:22,834
- Spill some soup on me?
- No, no, no.

624
00:26:22,836 --> 00:26:26,971
It's just, that was...
that was very real.

625
00:26:26,973 --> 00:26:30,094
That was, like, a very...
Very genuine apology.

626
00:26:30,097 --> 00:26:31,976
Well, I meant it.

627
00:26:31,978 --> 00:26:33,444
Well, I can tell. There's no snark.

628
00:26:33,446 --> 00:26:35,813
You're not throwing anything.

629
00:26:35,815 --> 00:26:38,950
You're right. I'm not. Hmm.

630
00:26:38,952 --> 00:26:41,219
The council might not have
helped your intelligence,

631
00:26:41,221 --> 00:26:43,421
but I think they...

632
00:26:43,423 --> 00:26:45,857
might have shown you a little...

633
00:26:45,859 --> 00:26:48,826
empathy?

634
00:26:48,828 --> 00:26:50,695
You know, DA Cecile Horton said

635
00:26:50,697 --> 00:26:52,797
there's other ways to be intelligent.

636
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,033
Open your heart...

637
00:26:55,035 --> 00:26:56,634
Open your mind.

638
00:26:56,636 --> 00:26:58,369
But it's been so long
since I've been concerned

639
00:26:58,371 --> 00:27:01,005
for other people's
feelings, though, you know?

640
00:27:01,007 --> 00:27:03,741
You know what?

641
00:27:03,743 --> 00:27:06,461
Maybe it is time I consider
someone else's feelings.

642
00:27:06,464 --> 00:27:08,846
Well, I feel...

643
00:27:08,848 --> 00:27:10,281
- DeVoe.
- DeVoe.

644
00:27:10,283 --> 00:27:12,817
Right? Maybe the council had a point.

645
00:27:12,819 --> 00:27:16,321
The best way for me
to understand DeVoe...

646
00:27:16,323 --> 00:27:18,289
put myself in his shoes.

647
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:19,490
Yeah.

648
00:27:19,492 --> 00:27:20,825
Is that what you were gonna say?

649
00:27:20,827 --> 00:27:22,126
No, I was gonna say DeVoe.

650
00:27:22,128 --> 00:27:23,476
- Okay.
- That makes sense.

651
00:27:23,479 --> 00:27:25,630
- It does.
- Yeah.

652
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,867
Hey, anything on Norvock?

653
00:27:29,869 --> 00:27:34,038
No, but I do have an update on DeVoe.

654
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,440
It's my finished article.

655
00:27:39,778 --> 00:27:41,979
Barry, look, I'm just
as anxious as you are

656
00:27:41,982 --> 00:27:43,948
about DeVoe, but I really think

657
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:46,258
that we need to arm the
citizens with information,

658
00:27:46,261 --> 00:27:49,153
- not shield them from it.
- Iris, I'm just...

659
00:27:49,155 --> 00:27:50,955
I'm trying to do
what's best for the city

660
00:27:50,957 --> 00:27:53,057
- and the team.
- And look...

661
00:27:53,059 --> 00:27:55,727
I think that telling
the truth is what's best.

662
00:27:55,729 --> 00:27:57,762
I mean, if we give them all
of the facts to consider,

663
00:27:57,764 --> 00:27:59,197
they will do the right thing.

664
00:27:59,199 --> 00:28:00,665
But how can you be sure about that?

665
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:03,801
Look, Barry...

666
00:28:03,803 --> 00:28:07,472
I can't deny that you've had
a tough year with DeVoe, but...

667
00:28:07,474 --> 00:28:12,944
his entire goal is to take
information away from people.

668
00:28:12,946 --> 00:28:14,345
If we don't publish this article,

669
00:28:14,347 --> 00:28:16,247
we are no better than he is.

670
00:28:16,249 --> 00:28:18,216
I just... this is...

671
00:28:18,218 --> 00:28:19,917
I think it's too risky.

672
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,420
I know that's how you feel...

673
00:28:22,422 --> 00:28:25,089
and I really want us
to be on the same page.

674
00:28:25,091 --> 00:28:28,826
So... it's your decision.

675
00:28:28,828 --> 00:28:31,262
- Iris...
- I just want you to remember

676
00:28:31,264 --> 00:28:32,997
that The Flash is a beacon of hope

677
00:28:32,999 --> 00:28:36,634
that the people have
always put their faith in.

678
00:28:36,636 --> 00:28:38,169
And now it's time for The Flash

679
00:28:38,171 --> 00:28:39,807
to put his faith in the people.

680
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,047
Ah, there you are.

681
00:28:49,049 --> 00:28:52,578
I couldn't help but notice
your anger and hostility.

682
00:28:52,581 --> 00:28:55,242
Thought your color was blue, not red.

683
00:28:55,245 --> 00:28:57,588
Yes, I'm angry. I've
been angry for weeks

684
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:59,090
and still no Killer Frost.

685
00:28:59,092 --> 00:29:00,858
And now Norvock's ruined everything.

686
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:03,261
Oh, Caitie.

687
00:29:03,263 --> 00:29:06,464
I hate to see you so torn up like this.

688
00:29:07,367 --> 00:29:08,800
So I'm going to tell you something

689
00:29:08,802 --> 00:29:10,134
that will cheer you up.

690
00:29:12,572 --> 00:29:14,672
That splicer...

691
00:29:14,674 --> 00:29:16,441
did not cure you.

692
00:29:18,144 --> 00:29:19,877
- What?
- Well, you...

693
00:29:19,879 --> 00:29:22,947
You had come to me so broken...

694
00:29:22,949 --> 00:29:24,649
so needy.

695
00:29:24,651 --> 00:29:27,018
And so I put that piece
of tech on your head, and,

696
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,120
poof, nothing!

697
00:29:29,122 --> 00:29:31,055
It did not work on you.

698
00:29:32,492 --> 00:29:35,393
So you decided to lie to
me rather than tell me that?

699
00:29:35,395 --> 00:29:37,862
Mm! But just because the splicer

700
00:29:37,864 --> 00:29:39,597
didn't technically work doesn't mean

701
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:41,199
that the results were not the same.

702
00:29:41,201 --> 00:29:43,101
How? That doesn't make any sense.

703
00:29:43,103 --> 00:29:45,729
You're the doctor. You tell me.

704
00:29:48,308 --> 00:29:49,907
It's a placebo.

705
00:29:49,909 --> 00:29:51,275
You see?

706
00:29:51,277 --> 00:29:54,011
It's been inside you the entire time.

707
00:29:54,013 --> 00:29:55,947
Caitie, your power is unlike

708
00:29:55,949 --> 00:29:57,682
anything I have ever seen before,

709
00:29:57,684 --> 00:30:00,818
and no science kit or placebo

710
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,954
is going to explain why you...

711
00:30:04,924 --> 00:30:07,658
Hmm.

712
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,494
A placebo...

713
00:30:10,663 --> 00:30:12,830
A fake.

714
00:30:12,832 --> 00:30:14,365
What are you talking about?

715
00:30:16,002 --> 00:30:19,137
I know exactly where Norvock is.

716
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,720
We were surprised to get the call.

717
00:30:35,722 --> 00:30:38,923
Shouldn't be. I'm running things now.

718
00:30:38,925 --> 00:30:41,859
Amunet's gone.

719
00:30:41,861 --> 00:30:44,526
But she did leave behind
something very valuable.

720
00:30:48,501 --> 00:30:50,935
30 times stronger than steel.

721
00:30:50,937 --> 00:30:53,471
You can assemble them
in any shape you like.

722
00:30:53,473 --> 00:30:55,406
And best of all...

723
00:30:55,408 --> 00:30:57,942
they're loaded with
enough potential energy

724
00:30:57,944 --> 00:30:59,877
to flatten a city.

725
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:04,931
- We know where Norvock is.
- Just when I thought

726
00:31:04,934 --> 00:31:06,055
I'd considered every option

727
00:31:06,058 --> 00:31:07,362
for where Norvock might be skulking,

728
00:31:07,364 --> 00:31:09,094
I remembered whenever the fuzz

729
00:31:09,097 --> 00:31:10,570
used to be onto one of our deals,

730
00:31:10,573 --> 00:31:12,371
I would plant a rumor
that it was going down

731
00:31:12,374 --> 00:31:13,492
at a false location.

732
00:31:13,495 --> 00:31:16,575
Ah, a fake-out to keep "the
fuzz" off your tracks.

733
00:31:16,578 --> 00:31:17,914
- Mm!
- So that's where we think

734
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:20,067
Norvock is, in the abandoned
Reynolds substation.

735
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,767
Underground. That's
why the shards weren't

736
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:23,631
- registering on the satellite.
- All right, why don't

737
00:31:23,633 --> 00:31:24,884
the three of us go get your shards?

738
00:31:24,886 --> 00:31:26,665
Then we'll be armed and ready
to take out DeVoe's satellites.

739
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:28,324
I'm coming too. I'll get the cold gun.

740
00:31:28,327 --> 00:31:30,042
Oh, goody, a group foray.

741
00:31:30,044 --> 00:31:31,644
Dibs on cashing in Norvock's chips.

742
00:31:31,646 --> 00:31:33,446
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

743
00:31:33,448 --> 00:31:35,748
- No killing.
- That was not a stipulation

744
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,241
when I agreed to join this crew.

745
00:31:37,244 --> 00:31:39,566
Okay, Amunet, look, I
know how you usually work,

746
00:31:39,569 --> 00:31:42,488
but I can handle this fast
and without an casualties.

747
00:31:44,592 --> 00:31:46,733
Okay. 'Tis a bit time-consuming

748
00:31:46,736 --> 00:31:49,227
to remove blood from metal.

749
00:32:03,645 --> 00:32:06,913
This deal's off. Those
shards belong to Amunet.

750
00:32:06,915 --> 00:32:08,874
Well, if that decrepit hag

751
00:32:08,877 --> 00:32:11,019
didn't want them stolen,
she shouldn't have told me

752
00:32:11,022 --> 00:32:14,287
- where she hid them.
- Decrepit?

753
00:32:14,289 --> 00:32:16,656
That's a big word for such a small man.

754
00:32:16,658 --> 00:32:18,085
Amunet, I've got this.

755
00:32:18,088 --> 00:32:19,688
There are some things that a woman

756
00:32:19,691 --> 00:32:20,975
just cannot delegate.

757
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:31,303
We agreed, no killing.

758
00:32:31,306 --> 00:32:33,296
That'll make this next part easy.

759
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:58,297
Joe, the shards are in there.
We can't let them get away.

760
00:33:15,617 --> 00:33:17,683
Barry, what's going on?

761
00:33:17,685 --> 00:33:19,685
Your vitals are going through the roof.

762
00:33:19,687 --> 00:33:21,153
- Venom!
- Like the venom

763
00:33:21,155 --> 00:33:23,189
on Amunet's locker. I'm on it.

764
00:33:25,468 --> 00:33:29,054
You are just as vile as
that thing in your head.

765
00:33:35,182 --> 00:33:37,316
Took a while to get this made.

766
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:40,273
Now you can't use those
things against me anymore.

767
00:33:40,275 --> 00:33:43,209
You always underestimated me.

768
00:33:47,181 --> 00:33:49,181
Caitlin, get back! Over here!

769
00:34:05,166 --> 00:34:06,832
- Iris...
- Barry, there is no antidote

770
00:34:06,834 --> 00:34:08,155
for meta-human venom that potent.

771
00:34:08,158 --> 00:34:09,635
You're gonna have to
phase through it now

772
00:34:09,637 --> 00:34:10,903
before it gets to your heart.

773
00:34:20,444 --> 00:34:21,810
I'm running out of ammo.

774
00:34:21,813 --> 00:34:23,713
They'll hit me before
I hit them with this.

775
00:34:25,732 --> 00:34:27,766
Damn.

776
00:34:27,769 --> 00:34:30,055
We've been looking at this
from the wrong direction.

777
00:34:30,058 --> 00:34:31,657
What... what are you doing?

778
00:34:36,715 --> 00:34:38,624
Nice!

779
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,515
Hmph!

780
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:29,254
I've never understood your superpower.

781
00:35:29,257 --> 00:35:32,350
Are you a man with a snake
or a snake with a man?

782
00:35:32,353 --> 00:35:34,085
Amunet! Don't kill him.

783
00:35:34,088 --> 00:35:35,654
He's more than earned it.

784
00:35:35,657 --> 00:35:37,791
It's not about him. It's about you.

785
00:35:37,794 --> 00:35:39,160
Caitlin.

786
00:35:39,163 --> 00:35:40,792
Amunet, there is a good part of you.

787
00:35:40,795 --> 00:35:43,429
I truly believe that.

788
00:35:47,602 --> 00:35:49,268
Fine.

789
00:35:57,278 --> 00:35:59,445
But the snake has got to go.

790
00:36:07,221 --> 00:36:10,156
Like Norvock, I must be on my way.

791
00:36:10,158 --> 00:36:11,679
Amunet, no! Hey!

792
00:36:11,682 --> 00:36:13,936
You leave, there's no way we
can stop DeVoe's satellites.

793
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:15,361
She was never gonna help us.

794
00:36:15,363 --> 00:36:16,530
She just wanted her metal.

795
00:36:16,533 --> 00:36:19,932
Oh... truthfully, I did consider it.

796
00:36:19,934 --> 00:36:23,703
I did. But a good player
knows when to fold.

797
00:36:23,705 --> 00:36:27,707
And the professor certainly
has a better hand, so...

798
00:36:27,709 --> 00:36:29,675
don't try to stop me.

799
00:36:29,677 --> 00:36:32,244
After all, I am packing.

800
00:36:32,246 --> 00:36:34,513
There is no where you can
go that DeVoe's satellites

801
00:36:34,515 --> 00:36:36,507
won't reach you. If you leave now,

802
00:36:36,510 --> 00:36:38,710
you'll be mind melted
just like the rest of us.

803
00:36:41,222 --> 00:36:42,804
Good point.

804
00:36:42,807 --> 00:36:44,656
Just for the record,
this is not me helping.

805
00:36:44,659 --> 00:36:47,593
It is entirely self-preservation.

806
00:36:54,736 --> 00:36:56,669
Filled with shrapnel and bound with

807
00:36:56,671 --> 00:36:58,504
my meta-human je ne sais quoi.

808
00:36:58,506 --> 00:37:01,507
Pull a shard, throw it, it will deliver

809
00:37:01,509 --> 00:37:04,310
one savage concussive blow.

810
00:37:04,312 --> 00:37:06,846
But you only get one shot.

811
00:37:07,715 --> 00:37:10,182
I know you won't waste it.

812
00:37:10,184 --> 00:37:12,418
Go save the world, my darling.

813
00:37:34,375 --> 00:37:36,308
And she's gone.

814
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,389
At least she didn't
leave us empty-handed.

815
00:37:46,966 --> 00:37:48,933
Eye snakes.

816
00:37:48,936 --> 00:37:51,033
Why did it have to be eye snakes?

817
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:54,437
Trust me, man, it wasn't
as cool as it sounds.

818
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,839
Guy's, I'm sorry I got so
worked up with Amunet around.

819
00:37:56,841 --> 00:37:59,096
- It's okay.
- Yeah, and Amunet did give us

820
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:01,277
the alnico metal projectile bomb.

821
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,268
I still think it's our
best bet at stopping DeVoe.

822
00:38:03,271 --> 00:38:05,147
- We just need to figure out how to fire it.
- Yeah.

823
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:06,649
Cisco, can you breach that thing?

824
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:07,825
Me? No way.

825
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:09,951
My energy field can't
even reach outer space.

826
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,193
'Kay, well, we need to find

827
00:38:11,196 --> 00:38:12,553
another solution, and we need to find it

828
00:38:12,555 --> 00:38:14,127
before DeVoe launches those satellites.

829
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:16,525
Well, actually, thanks to Ramon

830
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:18,594
and the Council of
Harrisons, we may have an idea

831
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:21,958
about why DeVoe has not
yet launched his satellites.

832
00:38:21,961 --> 00:38:23,832
He put himself in DeVoe's shoes.

833
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:26,075
And I thought, well, if
I was this ultra-genius

834
00:38:26,078 --> 00:38:28,204
moving around in a floating
chair, how would I feel?

835
00:38:28,206 --> 00:38:30,072
You'd feel nothing.
You'd be sociopathic.

836
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:31,907
- Mm.
- Right, but...

837
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:34,644
to me, I wouldn't consider
myself sociopathic, right?

838
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:37,446
No, all my actions would be driven

839
00:38:37,448 --> 00:38:41,517
by the one thing that I
care most about, right?

840
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:42,985
- And...
- So if you're not acting...

841
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,655
If I'm not acting, then I don't have

842
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:48,791
the one thing that I care most about...

843
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:50,826
my wife.

844
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:57,166
You guys need me to walk
you through this? So this...

845
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,735
No, we... we get it, Harry.

846
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:01,203
It's kind of complicated, but okay,

847
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:02,325
I'll take you at your word.

848
00:39:02,328 --> 00:39:03,639
Actually, that took a lot out of me.

849
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,241
I'm gonna go have a nap.

850
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:08,210
Well, we can work with that idea.

851
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:09,578
Yeah, I will fire up the satellite

852
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,113
and see if I can find Marlize.

853
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:12,715
And I'll start figuring
out how to launch

854
00:39:12,717 --> 00:39:16,682
this psychic dark matter-infused
metal shrapnel bomb.

855
00:39:16,685 --> 00:39:18,454
No big deal.

856
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:20,257
Joe, do you want to get
a cup of coffee with me

857
00:39:20,259 --> 00:39:21,658
before you go back to CCPD?

858
00:39:21,661 --> 00:39:24,593
I could use some caffeine after today.

859
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:29,765
I know you don't get tired

860
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:32,735
of hearing it, but...

861
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:35,791
- you were right.
- Well, not about Amunet.

862
00:39:35,794 --> 00:39:37,106
She still betrayed us.

863
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:39,709
But she knew the truth
about DeVoe, and...

864
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:41,477
she ultimately made a selfless decision

865
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:45,081
to help us by giving us the projectile.

866
00:39:45,083 --> 00:39:48,951
And I do have faith
in Central City, Iris.

867
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:52,288
Because I know that at
the core of every citizen

868
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:55,791
of this city is... something good.

869
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:00,062
And I know they'll feel the same way

870
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:03,032
when they read your article.

871
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:04,900
Let's tell the team.

872
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:09,805
Are you sure you want to do this?

873
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:11,507
You want me to publish my article?

874
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:13,509
Without a doubt.

875
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:20,082
We're always stronger, better together.

876
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,755
Kiss me.

877
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:28,130
Thank you.

878
00:40:32,697 --> 00:40:34,797
Ah-ah, this one's on me. I insist.

879
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:36,799
Nice. What'd I do to deserve that?

880
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:38,885
That's for giving me the advice I needed

881
00:40:38,888 --> 00:40:40,536
even when I didn't want to hear it.

882
00:40:40,538 --> 00:40:44,240
Well, when you raise kids,
you get used to giving advice.

883
00:40:44,242 --> 00:40:47,743
So I was convinced

884
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:49,512
that that splicer technology was the key

885
00:40:49,514 --> 00:40:50,746
to getting Killer Frost back.

886
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:52,318
But I was wrong.

887
00:40:52,321 --> 00:40:54,049
The splicer was just a placebo,

888
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:55,885
and it tricked me into manifesting

889
00:40:55,887 --> 00:40:57,386
those somatic results that I wanted.

890
00:40:57,388 --> 00:40:59,422
- You learned that from Amunet?
- Mm-hmm.

891
00:40:59,424 --> 00:41:00,990
I thought the answer was in science,

892
00:41:00,992 --> 00:41:03,125
but it was never gonna be there.

893
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,494
- So what now?
- I'm gonna take your advice.

894
00:41:05,496 --> 00:41:08,397
I'm gonna look in a
completely different direction.

895
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:11,400
The key to finding Killer
Frost is not out there.

896
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:12,635
It's in here.

897
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:14,270
Mm.

898
00:41:24,382 --> 00:41:26,322
- Iris, what's happening?
- Barry?

899
00:41:26,325 --> 00:41:27,850
- What?
- It's the city.

900
00:41:27,852 --> 00:41:29,185
- What?
- I posted my article,

901
00:41:29,187 --> 00:41:30,583
and they're responding.

902
00:41:30,586 --> 00:41:32,162
What do you mean? They believed you?

903
00:41:32,165 --> 00:41:34,298
More than that. They want to help. Look.

904
00:41:37,895 --> 00:41:40,996
This guy says he saw DeVoe
on 5th and Knoll two days ago.

905
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:42,942
Yeah, and another guy
on Crescent and 10th.

906
00:41:42,945 --> 00:41:46,135
This is great.

907
00:41:46,138 --> 00:41:49,601
Iris, this means DeVoe
can't hide from us anymore.

908
00:41:49,604 --> 00:41:52,085
