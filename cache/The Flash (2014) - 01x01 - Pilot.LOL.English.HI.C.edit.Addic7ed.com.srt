1
00:00:03,503 --> 00:00:05,838
To understand what I'm about to tell you,

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,806
you need to do something first.

3
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:10,009
You need to believe in the impossible.

4
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:11,844
Can you do that? Good.

5
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:13,178
You see that red blur?

6
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:15,047
That's me.

7
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:17,049
That too.

8
00:00:17,051 --> 00:00:20,986
There I am again.

9
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:22,855
My name is Barry Allen.

10
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:24,823
I am the fastest man alive.

11
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,796
My story is pretty simple.

12
00:00:30,798 --> 00:00:32,831
My whole life, I have been running.

13
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,199
Usually from bullies.

14
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,769
Sometimes I escaped.

15
00:00:36,771 --> 00:00:38,937
Sometimes I did not.

16
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,606
Tell me what happened.

17
00:00:40,608 --> 00:00:42,541
Those guys were picking on kids

18
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:45,010
just 'cause they thought they weren't cool.

19
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:47,312
- It wasn't right.
- I know.

20
00:00:47,314 --> 00:00:49,481
- I guess I wasn't fast enough.
- No.

21
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:52,217
You have such a good heart, Barry.

22
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:55,320
And it's better to have
a good heart than fast legs.

23
00:00:55,322 --> 00:00:57,623
Hello. I'm home.

24
00:00:57,625 --> 00:01:00,025
- Barry got into a fight.
- Oh, yeah?

25
00:01:00,027 --> 00:01:01,093
And he won.

26
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:04,263
Ah, way to go, slugger.

27
00:01:04,265 --> 00:01:07,666
Oh, and uh, no more fighting.

28
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:08,700
Mm-mm.

29
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:16,909
[Clatter]

30
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:26,785
But after that night,

31
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:29,054
I was running from something much scarier.

32
00:01:29,056 --> 00:01:31,423
- Something I could never explain.
- Henry! Henry!

33
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,359
Something impossible.

34
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:36,361
Help!

35
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:38,764
- Mom! Mom!
- Barry, don't!

36
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:41,400
- Mom!
- Don't let him touch you!

37
00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:43,769
- Mom!
- [Screaming]

38
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,437
Mom!

39
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,673
- Nora!
- Stay back!

40
00:01:47,675 --> 00:01:50,109
- Nora, hold on!
- [Screaming]

41
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:54,113
Run, Barry, run!

42
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:56,014
Mom?

43
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:57,850
Dad?

44
00:02:04,657 --> 00:02:08,827
[Panting]

45
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:12,898
Sorry. [Police siren]

46
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,666
Second robbery this week.

47
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:16,835
The teller I.D.'d Clyde
Mardon as the shooter.

48
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:18,270
What?

49
00:02:18,272 --> 00:02:20,005
Oh, jeez, the Mardon Brothers are back?

50
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:21,673
What do we got?

51
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:23,475
Perps took the bank, shot out the cameras,

52
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:26,011
and as a chaser, killed
the security guard over there.

53
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:27,513
I've got unis kicking in doors

54
00:02:27,515 --> 00:02:29,014
of known Mardon Brothers associates.

55
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:31,016
CSI been over it?

56
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:32,918
Uh, no.

57
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,621
Where's Allen?

58
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:39,124
- [Grunts]
- Sorry, sorry.

59
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:40,759
You can't keep covering for him.

60
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:42,628
- CSI, CSI coming through.
- If he's not here now,

61
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,996
I'm gonna have to carry on this
investigation without him.

62
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:45,330
Sorry I'm late, Captain Singh.

63
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:46,999
What was it this time, Mr. Allen?

64
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:48,467
Did you forget to set your alarm clock?

65
00:02:48,469 --> 00:02:50,002
Before you answer, I should remind you

66
00:02:50,004 --> 00:02:52,104
the excuse you gave last time
was car trouble.

67
00:02:52,106 --> 00:02:53,672
Want to know why that one
was particularly memorable?

68
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,274
I do not own a car.

69
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:56,842
He was running an errand for me.

70
00:02:56,844 --> 00:03:01,346
Barry, did you get me what I asked for?

71
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,148
Yeah, yeah. I did.

72
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,885
I have it right...

73
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:09,521
Here.

74
00:03:09,523 --> 00:03:11,657
I had a few bites of it.

75
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,044
Getaway car's a Mustang Shelby GT500.

76
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:34,479
Shelby's have a rear super-wide tire

77
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:35,981
specific to that model.

78
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:39,218
12 inches with an asymmetrical tread.

79
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,321
And there's something else.

80
00:03:42,323 --> 00:03:43,989
Thanks.

81
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,293
[Sniffs]

82
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:49,995
Fecal excrement.

83
00:03:49,997 --> 00:03:51,663
Animal, I'd guess.

84
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:54,166
My dad gave me that pen...

85
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:56,902
Before he died.

86
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:58,570
Sorry.

87
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:13,485
Okay, I am ready to see
this atom smasher smashing.

88
00:04:13,487 --> 00:04:15,587
There was a shooting today.

89
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:17,756
Your dad needs me to process some evidence,

90
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,191
which means I don't know if we're going

91
00:04:19,193 --> 00:04:20,892
to be able to make it to S.T.A.R. Labs.

92
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:23,262
But seeing this thing turn on
is like your dream.

93
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:25,197
Your sad, little nerdy dream.

94
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,565
Besides, I canceled a date for this.

95
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:29,201
Hands off my fries.

96
00:04:29,203 --> 00:04:30,736
Unbelievable.

97
00:04:30,738 --> 00:04:33,438
I'm stress eating over my dissertation.

98
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,107
We started selling cronuts at Jitters.

99
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:37,142
I ate two today. If I don't graduate soon,

100
00:04:37,144 --> 00:04:39,578
I'm gonna be more muffin top than woman.

101
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,946
You look amazing.

102
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:44,449
[Scoffs]

103
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,817
What is so important

104
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:48,253
about this particle accelerator anyway?

105
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,722
Harrison Wells' work in quantum theory

106
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,724
is light-years ahead of anything
they're doing at Cern.

107
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:56,128
You're doing that thing where
you're not speaking English.

108
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,863
Okay.

109
00:04:57,865 --> 00:05:00,599
Just imagine

110
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:04,469
that that dot is everything the human race

111
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:06,305
has ever learned until this moment.

112
00:05:06,307 --> 00:05:07,639
Does that include "twerking"?

113
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,541
That is everything we could learn

114
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:11,143
from the particle accelerator.

115
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:12,944
It's a whole new way of looking at physics.

116
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:14,313
It will literally change the way

117
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:16,648
that we think about everything.

118
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,550
You got to get yourself a girlfriend.

119
00:05:18,552 --> 00:05:20,385
Hey, leave him alone. He's working.

120
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:22,487
- Hi, dad.
- [Beeping]

121
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:26,325
- Your test thingy is done.
- Yeah.

122
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:28,627
I think the Mardon Brothers
are hiding on a farm.

123
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:31,463
The fecal matter I found on
the street, it was cow manure,

124
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:34,099
which contained traces of oxytetracycline.

125
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:35,600
It's an antibiotic.

126
00:05:35,602 --> 00:05:37,336
There are only four farms in the area

127
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:39,471
that still use it in their feed.

128
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:42,674
Bet you find a really sweet
Shelby parked at one of them.

129
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:44,810
Dad, seeing as how Barry
solved your poop problem,

130
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:48,280
how about letting him go to S.T.A.R. Labs?

131
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:52,050
- Fine, go.
- Yes!

132
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:54,052
Thank you, Joe.

133
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:02,861
So, Barry, how was your trip?

134
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,831
Did you find proof of the
impossible in Starling City,

135
00:06:05,833 --> 00:06:10,202
or did you just make my dad
mad for no reason?

136
00:06:10,204 --> 00:06:12,204
Actually, while I was away,

137
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:15,073
I had a chance to think about...

138
00:06:15,075 --> 00:06:16,842
You know, relationships.

139
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:19,578
And, well, I'm not in one.

140
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,948
And you're not in one, either.

141
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,117
And you're my best friend, Iris.

142
00:06:25,119 --> 00:06:26,852
You're mine too.

143
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:28,320
Why else would I be here?

144
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:30,155
That's not what I meant. What I...

145
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:31,189
I know what you're gonna say, Barry.

146
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:32,557
I'm not sure you do.

147
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,092
Even though we pretty much grew up

148
00:06:34,094 --> 00:06:35,694
in the same house together,

149
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:38,697
and we're kind of like brother and sister,

150
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:40,232
because we're not brother and sister,

151
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,768
it can get really weird and awkward

152
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,869
to talk to me about girls.

153
00:06:43,871 --> 00:06:45,170
But I just want you to know

154
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:47,205
that it shouldn't be awkward.

155
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:48,673
There is nothing that I want more

156
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:50,041
than for you to meet the right person

157
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:52,344
that totally loves and adores you

158
00:06:52,346 --> 00:06:55,847
for the amazing guy that you are.

159
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:57,916
[Chuckles]

160
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,451
Took the words right out of my mouth.

161
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:01,453
Aw, aren't you glad I know you so well?

162
00:07:01,455 --> 00:07:03,155
[Chuckles]

163
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:05,991
[Cheers and applause]

164
00:07:10,163 --> 00:07:12,497
Thank you.

165
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:14,933
My name is Harrison Wells.

166
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:18,236
Tonight, the future begins.

167
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:21,006
The work my team and I will do here

168

"This is a robbery."

Oh, you scared the hell out of us, kid.

345
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:53,945
Yeah, that was quite the nap
you took there, baby face,

- Yeah.
- Detective West,

350
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:04,789
we've got a 5.15 in progress
at Gold City Bank, two dead.

00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,457
Storm's really picking up
on the South side.

I'd grab your rain gear.

I'm sorry, Barry. I got to run.

- No, you take it easy.

once you settle in.

- Thanks, Eddie.
- Hey, Iris.

Detective, you should go.

Mardon and his brother
died trying to escape.

Awesome.

You don't really believe he
can run that fast, do you?

00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:58,069
Well, I believe anything is possible,

and in a few minutes,

382
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:02,306
maybe you will too.

It's a little snug.

385
00:19:10,817 --> 00:19:12,250
At least you will be moving so fast

386
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:15,319
no one will see you.

387
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,788
See, you thought the
world was slowing down.

388
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,056
It wasn't.

389
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:20,625
You were moving so fast

390
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:23,427
it only looked like everyone
else was standing still.

391

Dr. Wells will be monitoring
your energy output,

392
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:27,765
and Caitlin, your vitals.

What do you do?

This is a two-way headset
with a camera I modified.

Typically designed to combat
battlefield impulse noise,

397
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:39,977
or in your case, potential sonic booms,

398
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:43,114
which would be awesome. [Chuckles]

- Nothing.

I just noticed you don't smile too much.

401

My once promising career
in bioengineering is over,

402
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:00,598
my boss is in a wheelchair for life,

403
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,333
the explosion that put you in a coma

404

also killed my fiance.

feels like the way to go.

Witnesses from the robbery
at Gold City Bank.

Perp made off with 200 grand, more or less.

00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:39,163
- Catch these guys.
- The windows blew in.

422
00:21:39,165 --> 00:21:41,632
It was like a hurricane.

Everyone ran for cover.

"wide world of weird" cases

Apparently it all shorted out.

433
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,087
We got a bunch of witnesses here.

434

They all have cell phones.

Outside was inside.

Vukuvich, suspect is driving
a black Mustang.

Partial plate six-kilo-Charlie-three.

- Put out an APB.
- Copy that.

442
00:22:23,241 --> 00:22:25,943
It looks like you had
a distal radius fracture.

443
00:22:25,945 --> 00:22:28,379
Had?

444
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:30,414
It's healed... In three hours.

445
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:33,084
How is that even possible?

We don't know... yet.

You really need to learn how to stop.

What happened out there today?

449

You were moving pretty well,

450
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:45,363
and then something
caused you to lose focus.

451
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:47,598
I started remembering something.

452
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:55,606
When I was 11, my mother was murdered.

453
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:02,613
It was late.

454
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:04,148
A sound woke me up.

455
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:08,986
I came downstairs and...

456
00:23:08,988 --> 00:23:12,523
I saw what looked like a ball of lightning.

457
00:23:12,525 --> 00:23:15,259
Inside the lightning,

458
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:18,629
there was a man.

459
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:22,199
He killed my mom.

460
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:24,368
They arrested my dad.

461
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:28,105
He's still sitting
in Iron Heights for her murder.

462
00:23:28,107 --> 00:23:30,541
Everyone, the cops, the shrinks,

463
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:33,210
they all told me what I saw was impossible.

464
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,682
But what if the man who killed my mom

465
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:40,418
was like me?

466
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,287
Well, I think I can say unequivocally

you are one of a kind.

Can I help you, detective?

Doesn't seem like anyone's
in on the secret.

I was gonna tell you.

When you were in the hospital,

479
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:28,499
Eddie covered my father's shifts

480
00:24:28,501 --> 00:24:30,534
so that we could both be with you.

481
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:32,102
I thanked him with a cup of coffee,

498
00:26:19,545 --> 00:26:21,645
Barry! Iris.

499
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:23,881
I'm all right, dad.

500
00:26:23,883 --> 00:26:25,149
What the hell were you thinking

501
00:26:25,151 --> 00:26:26,517
- having her out here?
- No, no, no...

502
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:28,152
And I told you, when you see danger,

503
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:29,987
you run the other way. You're not a cop.

504
00:26:29,989 --> 00:26:31,522
- Because you wouldn't let me.
- You're damn right.

505
00:26:31,524 --> 00:26:32,623
Joe, I need to talk to you.

506
00:26:32,625 --> 00:26:37,595
- It can wait.
- No, now.

507
00:26:37,597 --> 00:26:39,597
I know who did this.

508
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,799
It's Clyde Mardon.

509
00:26:41,801 --> 00:26:43,834
I know everybody thinks
he died in a plane crash

510
00:26:43,836 --> 00:26:45,035
after the S.T.A.R. Labs explosion,

511
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:47,671
but he is alive.

512
00:26:47,673 --> 00:26:49,106
All right, something
happened to him that night.

513
00:26:49,108 --> 00:26:54,545
I... I think he can control the weather.

514
00:26:54,547 --> 00:26:56,614
The recent robberies,
they all happened during

515
00:26:56,616 --> 00:26:58,315
freak meteorological events.

516
00:26:58,317 --> 00:27:00,517
And when I just confronted Mardon,

517
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:05,155
the street was instantly enveloped in fog.

518
00:27:05,157 --> 00:27:08,058
Of course you don't believe me.

519
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,561
- You never believe me.
- Okay.

520
00:27:10,563 --> 00:27:11,829
You want to do this now?

521
00:27:11,831 --> 00:27:13,430
Out here? Fine.

522
00:27:13,432 --> 00:27:15,733
Mardon is dead.

523
00:27:15,735 --> 00:27:17,901
There is no controlling the weather, Barry.

524
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:19,503
Just like there was no lightning storm

525
00:27:19,505 --> 00:27:21,038
in your house that night.

526
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,073
It was your brain
helping a scared little boy

527
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:24,274
accept what he saw.

528
00:27:24,276 --> 00:27:25,909
My dad did not murder my mother.

529
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:27,678
Yes, he did! Your dad killed
your mother, Barry!

530
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,513
I am sorry, son!

531
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:31,048
But I knew it, the jury knew it,

532
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:32,249
and now he's paying for what he did.

533
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:34,018
- Dad, enough!
- Unh-uh, Iris.

534
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,419
I have done my best to take care of you

535
00:27:35,421 --> 00:27:36,887
since that night, and I have never asked

536
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:38,589
for anything in return,
not even a thank you,

537
00:27:38,591 --> 00:27:41,191
but what I do ask now is that you

538
00:27:41,193 --> 00:27:44,595
for once in your life
see things as they are.

539
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:56,073
You're not going to believe this.

540
00:27:56,075 --> 00:27:57,341
We got the eyewitness sketch

541
00:27:57,343 --> 00:27:59,743
of the robber from the bank job.

542
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:03,747
If I didn't know better,
I'd say that's Clyde Mardon.

543
00:28:03,749 --> 00:28:05,549
But that's impossible.

544
00:28:05,551 --> 00:28:08,385
He's dead, right?

545
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:09,920
I wasn't the only one affected

546
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:14,958
by the particle accelerator
explosion, was I?

547
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,160
We don't know for sure.

548
00:28:16,162 --> 00:28:17,461
You said the city was safe,

549
00:28:17,463 --> 00:28:19,730
that there was no residual danger.

550
00:28:19,732 --> 00:28:24,301
But that's not true, so what
really happened that night?

551
00:28:24,303 --> 00:28:25,936
Well...

552
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:27,805
The accelerator went active.

553
00:28:27,807 --> 00:28:31,608
We all felt like heroes, and then...

554
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:32,843
It all went wrong.

555
00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:34,745
The dimensional barrier ruptured,

556
00:28:34,747 --> 00:28:37,181
unleashing unknown energies into our world.

557
00:28:37,183 --> 00:28:38,749
Antimatter, dark energy, x-elements...

558
00:28:38,751 --> 00:28:40,117
Those are all theoretical.

559
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:42,119
And how theoretical are you?

560
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:45,622
We mapped the dispersion

561
00:28:45,624 --> 00:28:46,924
throughout and around Central City.

562
00:28:46,926 --> 00:28:48,125
Though we have no way of knowing

563
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:50,728
exactly what or... Who was exposed,

564
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,763
we've been searching for other

565
00:28:52,765 --> 00:28:55,766
- meta-humans like yourself.
- "Meta-humans"?

566
00:28:55,768 --> 00:28:57,735
That's what we're calling them.

567
00:28:57,737 --> 00:28:59,403
I saw one today.

568
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:01,672
He's a bank robber, and he
can control the weather.

569
00:29:01,674 --> 00:29:03,640
This just keeps getting cooler.

570
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:05,476
This is not cool.

571
00:29:05,478 --> 00:29:07,745
All right? A man died.

572
00:29:07,747 --> 00:29:10,814
Mardon must have gotten his
powers the same way I did.

573
00:29:10,816 --> 00:29:12,216
From the storm cloud.

574
00:29:12,218 --> 00:29:14,284
He's still out there.

575
00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:16,487
We have to stop him
before he hurts anyone else.

576
00:29:16,489 --> 00:29:18,322
Barry!

577
00:29:18,324 --> 00:29:19,556
That's a job for the police.

578
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:20,858
I work for the police.

579
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,193
As a forensic assistant.

580
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:24,695
You're responsible for this.

581
00:29:24,697 --> 00:29:25,796
For him.

582
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:28,732
What's important is you!

583
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:31,401
Not me. I lost everything.

584
00:29:31,403 --> 00:29:33,003
I lost my company.

585
00:29:33,005 --> 00:29:34,538
I lost my reputation.

586
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:36,540
I lost my freedom.

587
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:38,575
And then you broke your arm,

588
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:40,744
and it healed in three hours.

589
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:43,347
Inside your body could be a map

590
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:46,216
to a whole new world... Genetic therapies,

591
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:49,353
vaccines, medicines, treasures buried deep

592
00:29:49,355 --> 00:29:52,689
within your cells and we cannot
risk losing everything

593
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:56,560
because you want to go out and play hero!

594
00:29:56,562 --> 00:29:59,663
You're not a hero.

595
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:02,032
You are just a young man
who was struck by lightning.

596
00:30:17,415 --> 00:30:22,052
[Panting]

597
00:30:22,054 --> 00:30:23,353
I didn't do this.

598
00:30:23,355 --> 00:30:25,055
I swear to God, I didn't do this.

599
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:26,690
Dad, why are they taking you?

600
00:30:26,692 --> 00:30:28,559
- Barry, don't go in the house.
- Where's mom?

601
00:30:28,561 --> 00:30:29,560
What's gonna happen to my son?

602
00:30:29,562 --> 00:30:30,994
- Dad!
- Barry!

603
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:33,864
- Dad!
- Stay out of the house!

604
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:38,235
Barry!

605
00:30:38,237 --> 00:30:40,170
Joe, you know these people?

606
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:42,639
My daughter's best friends with their kid.

607
00:30:42,641 --> 00:30:45,342
- I'm sorry.
- Mm.

608
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:56,220
- Mom.
- Barry.

609
00:30:56,222 --> 00:30:57,721
Mom!

610
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:12,936
So that's my story.

611
00:31:12,938 --> 00:31:15,973
I've spent my whole life
searching for the impossible,

612
00:31:15,975 --> 00:31:19,910
never imagining that I would

613
00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:22,646
become the impossible.

614
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:30,053
So why come to me?

615
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:32,289
Something tells me you
didn't just run 600 Miles

616
00:31:32,291 --> 00:31:34,224
to say "hi" to a friend.

617
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:39,229
All my life, I've wanted to just do more...

618
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,031
Be more.

619
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:42,466
And now I am.

620
00:31:42,468 --> 00:31:45,135
And the first chance I get to help someone,

621
00:31:45,137 --> 00:31:47,871
I screw up.

622
00:31:47,873 --> 00:31:49,706
What if Wells is right?

623
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:51,475
What if I'm not a hero?

624
00:31:51,477 --> 00:31:53,810
What if I'm just some guy
who was struck by lightning?

625
00:31:53,812 --> 00:31:55,445
I don't think that bolt of lightning

626
00:31:55,447 --> 00:31:58,048
struck you, Barry.

627
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:02,319
I think it chose you.

628
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:05,489
I'm just not sure I'm like you, Oliver.

629
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:08,625
I don't know if I can be some... vigilante.

630
00:32:08,627 --> 00:32:12,663
You can be better.

631
00:32:12,665 --> 00:32:16,633
Because you can inspire people

632
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:19,770
in a way that I never could...

633
00:32:19,772 --> 00:32:22,172
Watching over your city
like a guardian angel...

634
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:25,943
Making a difference...

635
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:28,946
Saving people...

636
00:32:28,948 --> 00:32:31,882
In a flash.

637
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:37,854
Take your own advice.

638
00:32:37,856 --> 00:32:39,856
Wear a mask.

639
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:47,965
Cool.

640
00:32:52,103 --> 00:32:53,670
Cool.

641
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:01,211
I've been going over unsolved cases

642
00:33:01,213 --> 00:33:02,512
from the past nine months,

643
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:03,981
and there's been a sharp increase

644
00:33:03,983 --> 00:33:06,383
in unexplained deaths and missing people.

645
00:33:06,385 --> 00:33:07,851
Your meta-humans have been busy.

646
00:33:07,853 --> 00:33:09,519
Now, I'm not blaming you.

647
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:11,822
I know you didn't mean
for any of this to happen.

648
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:14,091
I know you all lost something.

649
00:33:14,093 --> 00:33:15,559
But I need your help to catch Mardon

650
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:17,561
and anyone else out there like him.

651
00:33:17,563 --> 00:33:18,996
But I can't do it without you.

652
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:26,436
If we're gonna do this,

653
00:33:26,438 --> 00:33:28,672
I have something that might help.

654
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:31,508
Something I've been playing with.

655
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,876
Designed to replace the turnouts

656
00:33:32,878 --> 00:33:35,012
firefighters traditionally wear.

657
00:33:35,014 --> 00:33:36,780
I thought if S.T.A.R. Labs
could do something nice

658
00:33:36,782 --> 00:33:38,215
for the community, maybe people wouldn't

659
00:33:38,217 --> 00:33:40,183
be so angry at Dr. Wells anymore.

660
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:42,185
How is it going to help me?

661
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:43,754
It's made of a reinforced tri-polymer.

662
00:33:43,756 --> 00:33:45,589
It's heat and abrasive resistant,

663
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:47,057
so it should withstand your moving

664
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:48,392
at high-velocity speeds.

665
00:33:48,394 --> 00:33:49,726
And the aerodynamic design

666
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:51,094
should help you maintain control.

667
00:33:51,096 --> 00:33:52,562
Plus, it has built-in sensors

668
00:33:52,564 --> 00:33:54,031
so we can track your vitals

669
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:55,499
and stay in contact with you from here.

670
00:33:55,501 --> 00:33:56,867
Thanks.

671
00:33:56,869 --> 00:33:58,502
Now how do we find Mardon?

672
00:33:58,504 --> 00:34:00,437
I retasked S.T.A.R. Labs satellite

673
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:02,139
to track meteorological abnormalities

674
00:34:02,141 --> 00:34:03,273
over Central City.

675
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:04,674
We just got a ping.

676
00:34:04,676 --> 00:34:06,610
Atmospheric pressure dropped 20 millibars

677
00:34:06,612 --> 00:34:08,645
in a matter of seconds.

678
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:11,581
I've tracked it to a farm
just west of the city.

679
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:15,752
I'm not saying Mardon is alive.

680
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:17,254
But if he was, this is the last place

681
00:34:17,256 --> 00:34:18,588
him and his brother hid out.

682
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,090
Let's go.

683
00:34:31,502 --> 00:34:33,103
Mardon?

684
00:34:33,105 --> 00:34:34,738
On your feet.

685
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,239
Hands on your head.

686
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,075
You got me. [Chuckles]

687
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:44,448
The night of the storm,
after S.T.A.R. Labs blew,

688
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:46,249
after our plane went down,

689
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:48,085
and I woke up on the ground alive,

690
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:53,290
when I saw what I can do, I understood.

691
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:54,458
I am God.

692
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,594
Shut the hell up.

693
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,496
Turn around.

694
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:10,373
Do you think that your guns can stop God?

695
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:13,977
Why in the hell would God
need to rob banks?

696
00:35:13,979 --> 00:35:15,979
You're right.

697
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:18,849
I've been thinking too small.

698
00:35:55,453 --> 00:35:56,653
Barry! Barry!

699
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,288
This thing's getting closer.

700
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,690
Wind speeds are 200
Miles-per-hour and increasing.

701
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:01,758
Barry, can you hear me?

702
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,627
Yeah. Loud and clear.

703
00:36:03,629 --> 00:36:08,031
If it keeps up, this could
become an F-5 tornado.

704
00:36:08,033 --> 00:36:09,199
But it's headed towards the city.

705
00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:11,968
How do I stop it? Guys?

706
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:16,740
What if I unravel it?

707
00:36:16,742 --> 00:36:18,375
How the hell are you going to do that?

708
00:36:18,377 --> 00:36:20,277
I'll run around it
in the opposite direction,

709
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:22,045
cut off its legs.

710
00:36:22,047 --> 00:36:23,780
He'd have to clock
700 Miles-per-hour to do that.

711
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:25,849
Your body may not
be able to handle those speeds.

712
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:27,384
You'll die.

713
00:36:27,386 --> 00:36:30,220
I have to try.

714
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:43,066
[Chuckles] The suit's holding up.

715
00:36:43,068 --> 00:36:44,868
- But he's not.
- He can do it.

716
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:45,870
I know he can do it.

717
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:58,582
[Grunting]

718
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:05,088
It's too strong!

719
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:07,958
It's time to think big.

720
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:15,865
You can do this, Barry.

721
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:17,000
You were right.

722
00:37:17,002 --> 00:37:19,369
I am responsible for all of this.

723
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:21,338
So many people have been hurt

724
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,939
because of me, and when I looked at you,

725
00:37:22,941 --> 00:37:25,976
all I saw was another potential
victim of my hubris.

726
00:37:25,978 --> 00:37:27,544
And yes, I created this madness,

727
00:37:27,546 --> 00:37:30,814
but you, Barry, you can stop it.

728
00:37:30,816 --> 00:37:33,183
You can do this.

729
00:37:33,185 --> 00:37:36,319
Now run, Barry, run!

730
00:38:10,588 --> 00:38:13,657
[Screaming]

731
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:24,034
Barry?

732
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:29,339
Hey.

733
00:38:32,943 --> 00:38:36,246
I didn't think there was
anyone else like me.

734
00:38:36,248 --> 00:38:38,348
I'm not like you.

735
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:41,685
You're a murderer.

[Gunshots]

737
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,890
- Barry?
- It's over.

00:38:46,892 --> 00:38:49,392
I'm okay.

00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:25,261
What you can do...

740
00:39:25,263 --> 00:39:28,465
It was the lightning bolt?

741
00:39:28,467 --> 00:39:31,735
More or less.

742
00:39:31,737 --> 00:39:34,804
I'm sorry, Barry.

743
00:39:34,806 --> 00:39:38,041
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.

744
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:42,612
And I called you crazy
for chasing the impossible.

745
00:39:42,614 --> 00:39:43,913
But you really did see something

746
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:45,081
that night your mom died.

747
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,719
And your dad is innocent.

748
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,091
I need you to promise me something.

749
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:57,093
I don't want you telling Iris

750

about anything you can do, any of it.

751
00:40:00,298 --> 00:40:02,132
I want her safe.

00:40:02,134 --> 00:40:05,201
Promise me.

00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:07,604
Yeah.

Funny thing is, I finally got

00:40:34,366 --> 00:40:35,765
into a fight today.

760
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:37,367
You just got out of a coma.

I'm not sure you should be picking fights.

Hey...

00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:46,976

Yeah, I did.

[Chuckles]

You didn't kill mom.

You know I know that, right?

You're not gonna be in here much longer.

It's time to let it go.

For the first time,
I feel like I finally can.

The truth is,
ever since the night mom died,

I've been stuck in one place,

You remember when you
wanted me to change my name
