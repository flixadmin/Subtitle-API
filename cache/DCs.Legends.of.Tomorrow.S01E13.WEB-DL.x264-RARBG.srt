1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,503
- <i>In 2166, an immortal tyrant</i>
<i>named vandal savage</i>

2
00:00:04,505 --> 00:00:07,006
<i>Conquered the world</i>
<i>and murdered my wife and child.</i>

3
00:00:07,008 --> 00:00:09,975
<i>I have assembled an elite team</i>
<i>to hunt him throughout time</i>

4
00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:11,577
<i>And stop his rise to power.</i>

5
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:13,946
<i>Unfortunately, my plan</i>
<i>is opposed by the body</i>

6
00:00:13,948 --> 00:00:17,016
<i>I'd sworn my allegiance to,</i>
<i>the time masters.</i>

7
00:00:17,018 --> 00:00:19,451
<i>In the future, my friends</i>
<i>may not be heroes,</i>

8
00:00:19,453 --> 00:00:21,387
<i>But if we succeed,</i>

9
00:00:21,389 --> 00:00:24,757
<i>They will be remembered</i>
<i>as legends.</i>

10
00:00:26,493 --> 00:00:30,429
<i>- Previously</i>
<i>on "legends of tomorrow"...</i>

11
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:32,064
<i>- The flashes</i>
<i>I've been having--</i>

12
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:33,732
<i>They're of carter.</i>

13
00:00:33,734 --> 00:00:35,334
- It must be really weird

14
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:37,002
Feeling like you're
cheating on me with him.

15
00:00:37,004 --> 00:00:38,404
- No, ray,

16
00:00:38,406 --> 00:00:40,939
I feel like I'm cheating on him

17
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:43,542
With you.

18
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,944
- We need to move swiftly
to locate vandal savage.

19
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:50,416
There is one place in time
that we know savage to be.

20
00:00:50,418 --> 00:00:51,984
- 2166.

21
00:00:51,986 --> 00:00:54,753
- We have, quite literally,
run out of time.

22
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,392
[engines whirring]

23
00:01:00,394 --> 00:01:03,395
[explosions]

24
00:01:03,397 --> 00:01:04,797
- Oh!
We're gonna need to find

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,765
A safe place to set down,
gideon.

26
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:09,001
<i>- I don't believe there are</i>
<i>any safe places, captain.</i>

27
00:01:09,003 --> 00:01:10,869
- Are we over london yet?

28
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:13,539
- What's left of it.
- Why's london shooting at us?

29
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:15,674
- It's savage's forces
that are doing the shooting.

30
00:01:15,676 --> 00:01:18,477
Here in 2166, they've subjugated
most of the globe.

31
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,047
[explosions]

32
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:24,850
- Maybe picking up here
wasn't the brightest idea.

33
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:26,652
- Unfortunately,
we no longer have the luxury

34
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:28,821
Of blindly searching
for savage throughout history.

35
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:30,722
- Indeed;
we have to target savage

36
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:33,592
At the time and place that we're
certain he will be, which is--

37
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:36,695
- Right before
he wastes your family.

38
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:38,030
What?

39
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:40,566
- Yes, mr. Rory,
savage will kill my wife and son

40
00:01:40,568 --> 00:01:44,036
In three days' time, but we can
save them and the world

41
00:01:44,038 --> 00:01:46,071
By stopping savage now.

42
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:48,640
[explosions]

43
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,412
- Captain, I've managed to slip
<i>beneath their artillery fire.</i>

44
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:55,614
- Set us down on the outskirts
of the city, gideon,

45
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,550
Near the encampment of the
remaining resistance forces.

46
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:00,552
We are going to need
to proceed swiftly.

47
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:01,920
- I realize your family
is in jeopardy,

48
00:02:01,922 --> 00:02:03,388
But perhaps some deliberation--

49
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,657
- We really don't have the time,
martin.

50
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,126
According to gideon,
savage is going to be

51
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:10,162
Out in the open tonight--
vulnerable.

52
00:02:10,164 --> 00:02:12,498
Now, in order to capture him,

53
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,832
I require the services of--

54
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:15,934
- A killer, klepto, and pyro?

55
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,803
- Bingo.

56
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:22,174
- Here we stand
at the edge of history.

57
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:24,109
But as tempting as it might be

58
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:27,980
To celebrate
our previous victories,

59
00:02:27,982 --> 00:02:31,183
It is only for the next
and final battle

60
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:33,485
That you will be remembered.

61
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,521
- There's no way
we can grab him here.

62
00:02:35,523 --> 00:02:37,656
- Not with an army
standing between us.

63
00:02:37,658 --> 00:02:40,526
- Shh, I'm trying
to listen to this guy.

64
00:02:41,528 --> 00:02:43,028
He gives a hell of a speech.

65
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,531
- Onward to victory!

66
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:47,099
[all shout in unison]

67
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:50,135

[all shout in unison]

69
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:55,507

70
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:56,708
Quick time. Move!

71
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,610
<i>- All set on our end.</i>

72
00:02:58,612 --> 00:03:01,213
Jax is in the jumpship,
ready to extract you guys.

73
00:03:01,215 --> 00:03:03,982
- Especially if--
and by if, I mean when--

74
00:03:03,984 --> 00:03:05,951
This thing goes south.

That bracelet she's wearing--

82
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:34,713
Can you get a clearer image?

Oh, my god.

- If we don't move real soon,
we could get ourselves killed.

87
00:03:51,632 --> 00:03:53,632
- How about we play this
like chicago?

88
00:03:53,634 --> 00:03:54,700

Mr. Jackson,

00:04:57,598 --> 00:04:59,598

What exactly do you think
you were doing back there?

114
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:19,818
- Distracting savage's pals,

115
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,253
Which worked, by the way.

116
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:22,654
- Yes, well,
I could've been killed.

117
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:24,189
- Never said
it worked perfectly.

118
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:25,657
- At least it wasn't
a complete bust.

119
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,894
We found out
about kendra's bracelet.

120
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:30,228
- What bracelet?

121
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:32,030
[computer whirring]

122
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:35,167
- My bracelet--I was wearing it
the night of my first death.

123
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,968
- That's great.

124
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,304
Not the death part.
That's terrible.

125
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:40,739
But you told us
that objects

Present on the night
of your death

00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:43,642

You're my fiancÃ©e.
I listen to you.

129
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:46,611
- And that's sweet,

130

But there's still
one small problem.

131
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:51,249
It's a bracelet; how are you
supposed to kill savage with it?

132
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:53,618
- A question we will answer
the moment we have obtained it.

133
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,287
We need our resident
kleptomaniacs

134
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:56,888
To steal that bracelet.

They might have
information on savage

In the meantime, ms. Lance,
get ms. Saunders ready.

Ray.

With a piece of jewelry?

147
00:06:18,812 --> 00:06:19,945
- Good question.

148
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:21,713

These resistance fighters,

156
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:40,165
We meet up with more
of savage's forces?

I brought along

Blow you straight to hell.

163
00:06:50,177 --> 00:06:53,278
- Better yet, give her
several good reasons.

164
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,215
- My wife and son
live in whitechapel.

165
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:59,851

- I know.

166

- How do we know
you're not with savage?

- Because if we were,
you'd be dead right now.

00:07:08,228 --> 00:07:11,062
Look, feel free to shoot us,
but from the looks of it,

170
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:13,498
You could use all the allies
you can get.

171
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:20,372
- Whitechapel fell 11 days ago.

172
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:22,374
We have a lot of refugees.

173
00:07:22,376 --> 00:07:24,810
You think your wife and son
are among them?

174
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:27,712
- Sadly, I'm confident
that they're not.

175
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:30,715
Still, we would like to help
in whatever way we can.

176
00:07:30,717 --> 00:07:32,751
- Very well;
get yourselves acclimated,

177
00:07:32,753 --> 00:07:34,152
And I'll rejoin you shortly.

178
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:40,492
[indistinct chatter]

179
00:07:42,495 --> 00:07:43,995
- Hey.

180
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:56,007
Uh, I would've brought more,
but...

181
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,079
- Jefferson.

182
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:02,481
Jefferson, let's--

183
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:04,282
Let's return to the ship,

184
00:08:04,284 --> 00:08:07,919
And we'll bring back
those additional provisions.

185
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:09,488
Don't worry.

186
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:13,024
There's plenty more
where that came from.

187
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,392
We'll be back.

188
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,997
- So what did you mean
back there,

189
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,131
About your family?

190
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:21,766
- I'd rather not
discuss it.

191
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:23,768
- Yeah, I picked up on that.

192
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:25,871
I also picked up on the fact
that we're in london

193
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:29,107
Just a few days before savage
tries to kill your wife and son,

194
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:32,277
And you're not trying
to get them to safety.

195
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,015
- After my first attempt
on savage in ancient egypt,

196
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:41,286
My very next stop
was here in 2166.

197
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:43,388
I found miranda and jonas
exactly where I'd left them,

198
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,825
And we--we raced
towards the waverider,

199
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:54,199
But we had a run-in
with savage's shocktroopers.

200
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,401
Miranda and jonas
were cut down.

201
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:04,876
So I jumped even further back,

202
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:08,647
And the outcome
was exactly the same.

203
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:14,119
I watched my family die
countless times

204
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:16,421
At the hands of savage
and his forces

205
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:20,825
Before I realized that...

206
00:09:20,827 --> 00:09:22,961
- Time wants to happen.

207
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,233
- Funny feeling knowing
that the universe itself

208
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:32,203
Doesn't want you
to save your family.

209
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:34,205
- All right,
what are you all playing at?

210
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,840
I retina-scanned
the four of you.

211
00:09:35,842 --> 00:09:37,208
There's no record of you
anywhere,

212
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:40,278
And you and your friends
disappeared 150 years ago.

213
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,047
- Believe me
when I tell you

214
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:43,214
It would take
about that much time

215
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:44,316
For us to tell the whole story.

216
00:09:44,318 --> 00:09:46,084
But the most important thing

217
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,953
Is that we get as close
to vandal savage as possible.

218
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:50,455
- No one gets close to savage,
especially not now.

219
00:09:50,457 --> 00:09:53,558
Some idiots made an attempt
on his life earlier tonight.

220
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,360
He's gone to ground
in the citadel's bunker

221
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:57,228
And he's holed up
good and tight.

222
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:59,464
<i>- Delta camp is under attack.</i>
<i>Taking heavy fire.</i>

223
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:00,932
<i>We need air support.</i>

224
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:02,400
- Where's delta camp?

225
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:07,405
- Establish a perimeter!

226
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:11,076
Once it's secure,
we'll search for survivors.

227
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:13,545
Last week, savage's forces
laid waste to tokyo.

228
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:16,414
London is the last patch
of free ground on the planet.

229
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,183
Savage's armies have cut down

230
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:21,086
The most formidable militaries
in the world.

231
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:24,022
What do you men think you can do
against an evil like this?

232
00:10:24,024 --> 00:10:27,025
<i>[foreboding music]</i>

233
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:35,100
<i>â™ª</i>

234
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:42,974
- There were no survivors
from the attack.

235
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,376
- No, whatever weapon
savage used against the rebels

236
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:46,911
Was quite effective.

237
00:10:46,913 --> 00:10:48,613
- Maybe professor stein and I
should survey the wreckage,

238
00:10:48,615 --> 00:10:50,148
Analyze some soil samples,

239
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:52,317
Determine what kind of weaponry
savage is using.

240
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,285
Until we figure out a way
to thwart his firepower,

241
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:55,420
The rebels are
as good as dead.

242
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:56,621
- But remember
why we're here:

243
00:10:56,623 --> 00:10:59,324
To stop savage,
not to slow him down.

244
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,960
Do we have a plan
for stealing this bracelet?

245
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:03,094
- We're on it.

246
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:04,329
- Please don't tell me
the plan

247
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:05,664
Is to walk
into savage's citadel

248
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,132
And steal it off her wrist.

249
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:10,001
- All right,
I won't tell you that.

250
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,436
- [groans]

251
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:13,438
- All right,
well, we still have the issue

252
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,274
Of how to turn a piece
of jewelry into a lethal weapon.

253
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:18,243
- Perhaps there is reference
to the bracelet

254
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:21,046
In professor boardman's diary.

255
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:22,614
- I doubt it.

256
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:26,084
I've read through my son's
research a thousand times.

257
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:28,720
- Savage has
a devastating weapon

258
00:11:28,722 --> 00:11:33,024
At his command, and here now,
at the eleventh hour,

259
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:36,528
We could sorely use
a weapon of our own.

260
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:38,329
- I'll look into it.

261
00:11:40,332 --> 00:11:42,400
This is such a waste of time.

262
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,469
I've already looked through
every single page

263
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:46,337
Of aldus' notebooks.

264
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:48,206
If he had written something
specific about the bracelet

265
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,508
And killing savage,
I would have known it already.

266
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:55,213
- Here it is.

267
00:11:55,215 --> 00:12:00,185
<i>[melancholy music]</i>

268
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:02,087
You ever think about him?

269
00:12:02,089 --> 00:12:05,423
- Carter?

270
00:12:05,425 --> 00:12:07,192
I try not to.

271
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:09,694
It's not like
I'll ever see him again.

272
00:12:09,696 --> 00:12:12,630
Not in this lifetime, anyway.

273
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:16,167
Besides, carter is my past.

274
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:18,303
Ray is my future.

275
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:21,473
- Still,
4,000-year-long relationship...

276
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:23,408
Seems like it'd be
hard to get over.

277
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:25,744
- Yeah.

278
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:28,847
Maybe once savage is gone,
I can finally start to.

279
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,151
- [grunts]

280
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:36,154

281
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:37,522
[shattering]

282
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,662
Wow.

283
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,032
What's the occasion?

284
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:52,504
- I'll give you one guess.
- Our anniversary?

285
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:54,072
Look, I'm sorry,
but in my defense,

286
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:55,406
There's quite a few of them
to remember.

287
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:59,644
- We were only married in...
Eight lifetimes.

288
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:01,446
- That's a lot.

289
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:03,615
But I do remember

290
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,316
Your victorian England
incarnation

291
00:13:05,318 --> 00:13:07,852
Being particularly tough
to be pinned down.

292
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:13,491
- Why are you
handing this to me?

293
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:15,126
- Well,
it's an anniversary gift.

294
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,561
- Oh.
[laughs]

295
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:18,797
You have got to stop giving me
weapons as presents.

296
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,766
- I think it's time
you learn how to use it.

297
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:23,368
- But it's your weapon.

298
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,069
- Savage has murdered us
countless times,

299
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:27,238
And we aren't always
lucky enough to die together.

300
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,641
- This is awfully depressing
talk for our anniversary,

301
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:30,642
Don't you think?

302
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:33,344
- Kendra, this is important.

303
00:13:33,346 --> 00:13:35,213
I need to know
that if I go first,

304
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:37,115
You have everything you need
to face him.

305
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:39,784
- I don't want to think
about facing savage--

306
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:42,554
Or life--without you.

307
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,430
- You'll never be without me,

308
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:53,598
No matter what.

309
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,366
I'll always be near.

310
00:13:55,368 --> 00:13:58,303
Just give it a try.

311
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,309
- Who's to say
I'll ever be strong enough

312
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:06,644
To kill savage by myself?

313
00:14:06,646 --> 00:14:09,113
- Just trust me.

314
00:14:09,115 --> 00:14:10,915
You have everything you need.

I just did.

Dismissed.

We just like

- How do you know my name?

339
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,774

we could go a whole week

340
00:15:42,776 --> 00:15:44,542
Without kidnapping anyone.

341
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:45,977

it would have been better

342
00:15:45,979 --> 00:15:47,345
To simply kill me.

343
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:48,746
- I agree.

344
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:50,448
- It's a little more complicated
than that.

345
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,383
She knew who I was.

346

It's a pleasure to meet you,
gareeb.

348
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:02,827
- I see savage has been rather
chatty with his lieutenants.

349
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:06,497
- If you think I am
merely savage's soldier,

350

You're more idiotic
than he claimed.

355
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,556
- Vandal savage
has a daughter?

356
00:16:31,558 --> 00:16:33,891
- Apparently it's true.
There's a lid for every pot.

357
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:36,694
- And this lid is gonna be
very upset when he finds out

358
00:16:36,696 --> 00:16:37,862
That we took his pot.

359
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,698
You know what I mean.

360
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,600
- So what's the problem?

361
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:44,769
It's not like we're on savage's
christmas card list.

362
00:16:44,771 --> 00:16:46,471
- And we snagged the bracelet.

363
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:48,006
You're welcome, by the way.

364
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,874
- We need to weaponize
that thing before savage knows

365
00:16:49,876 --> 00:16:51,576
That it and his daughter
are missing.

366
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:54,312
- Actually, I think
I've got that figured out.

367
00:16:54,314 --> 00:16:56,581
But I'm gonna need you
to burn something for me.

368
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:57,749
- About time.

369
00:16:57,751 --> 00:16:59,384
- We also need to figure out

370
00:16:59,386 --> 00:17:00,985
What we're going to do
with our new guest.

371
00:17:00,987 --> 00:17:02,687
- She's seen us and the ship.

372
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,689
If she runs back to savage,
we're giving him

373
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:05,957
A huge advantage.

374
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:07,792
- So we make her our advantage.

375
00:17:07,794 --> 00:17:09,861
We send papa savage a finger.

376
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:11,829
And we keep sending them

377
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:14,032
Till he puts his own head
on the chopping block.

378
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:16,367
- That is a positively lurid
idea.

379
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,568
I know we're in the midst
of a war,

380
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:18,903
But can't we maintain our honor?

381
00:17:18,905 --> 00:17:21,506
- I'd rather maintain my life,
professor.

382
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:23,841
- If she is savage's daughter,
then she would know

383
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:25,576
The details of his defenses.

384
00:17:25,578 --> 00:17:26,878
- Yes, well, how exactly
are we going to get

385
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,946
Those details out of her?

386
00:17:28,948 --> 00:17:30,014
- I'm on it.

387
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:35,620
[door whirring]

388
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:38,689
Hello, cassie.
May I call you cassie?

389
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:41,059
Here's the deal.
You have information.

390
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:42,460
I want it.

391
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:44,362
The question is,

392
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:46,097
How am I gonna get it?

393
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,769
- I'm the daughter
of vandal savage,

394
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:54,605
The immortal ruler
of the world.

395
00:17:54,607 --> 00:17:57,875
Do you think he hasn't
prepared me for this?

396
00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:59,677
Do you think I haven't
already been taught

397
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,846
To endure the
most extreme suffering?

398
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:05,683
- You know, your father
sounds a lot like mine.

399
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:08,486
Could never really say,
"I love you,"

400
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:10,721
Except with his fists.

401
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:13,624
- Our fathers
are nothing alike,

402
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:15,760
Mr. Snart.

403
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:21,766
14 years ago, the world
was ruled by a madman,

404
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,568
Per degaton.

405
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:25,703
He unleashed
the armageddon virus

406
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:27,839
In order to conquer the globe.

407
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:31,042
It tore through the world
like a fire.

408
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:34,779
Millions died,
including my mother.

409
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:39,750
There were riots, wars.
Hell on earth.

410
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:42,787
No one dared to stand up
to degaton,

411
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:46,390
Except for my father.

412
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:48,559
He may not be a kind man,

413
00:18:48,561 --> 00:18:49,927
But he is
the only one capable

414
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:53,631
Of putting this world
back together.

415
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:57,668
So you can torture me
if you like.

416
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,905
My suffering's
a small price to pay.

417
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,775
- Who said anything
about torture?

418
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:08,412
[fire whooshing]

419
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,485

420
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:17,755
Bash savage's skull
with carter's mace?

421
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:19,123
- You got a better plan?

422
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,159
- It's not the weapon
I'm worried about.

423
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,794
Thousands of years
of reincarnation,

424
00:19:23,796 --> 00:19:26,998
And I'm guessing you've killed
a grand total of nobody.

425
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,801
Yet here you are, entering
into the olympics of murder.

426
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:32,003
- What's your point?

427
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,772
- You sure you can
look savage in the eye

428
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:38,576
And kill him?

429
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:42,046
- I'm sure.
- Well, you better be.

430
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:44,182
Otherwise, you're gonna end up
like the last guy

431
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:46,651
Who swung that thing.

432
00:19:57,462 --> 00:20:00,131
- Savage's superweapon
isn't an explosive.

433
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:02,466
- The exact conclusion
I've just come to

434
00:20:02,468 --> 00:20:04,769
After examining soil samples
from the attack site.

435
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:06,103
How did you determine it?

436
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:09,140
- Gideon--she found
a defunct spy satellite.

437
00:20:09,142 --> 00:20:12,109
Look at the photos here.
This is the camp.

438
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:13,578

What do they look like?

442
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:23,087
- What am I supposed
to be seeing?

00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:25,256
Oh, my god.

444
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:27,625
Those are not

- Yeah, you and a bunch
of innocent refugees.

458

- If they were innocent,

459
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:09,066
They wouldn't have rebelled
against my father.

460
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,137
- Whatever it is,
it's getting closer.

461

- Well, we're a little short
on weapons.

462

we'll just have to fight it.

- Saving a township,
by the looks of it.

472
00:21:41,701 --> 00:21:43,567
- Since when did my vessel
become a life raft?

473
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:44,935
- Since I decided we can't

474
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:46,337
Leave these people here
to be slaughtered.

475
00:21:46,339 --> 00:21:48,005
You recruited us

That includes everyone here.

477

Destiny is nothing more
than the sum of our own choices.

892
00:41:35,527 --> 00:41:38,094
- I see.

893
00:41:38,096 --> 00:41:40,897

there's hope, then...

894
00:41:40,899 --> 00:41:42,398
For your family.

895
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:47,403
Time will tell, captain.

896
00:41:50,841 --> 00:41:52,375
Time will tell.
