My readings show something's down here.

178
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,818
And it's definitely big enough
to be an Atlantean ship.

179

If it is, we might be able to scavenge

It's a structure of some kind.

And there's more buried in the ice.

194

The Ninth Tride of Atlantis,

244
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:49,166
and there are now reports of outbreaks
in the Fishermen Kingdom as well.

245

There haven't been outbreaks like this
in centuries.

246

Why now?

247
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:57,296
Increased ocean acidity, decreased
oxygen levels, toxic algal blooms.

Take your pick.

249
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:04,015
The surface has been poisoning
our atmosphere for over a century.

250

You can't expect them to care
about what happens to us

00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:08,728
if they don't even know we exist.

If you want to be a part

256
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,914
Your majesty is well aware
of the Council's position on this.

257
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,164
Listen, we can talk to their scientists
and combine our technologies

258
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,416
to reverse the damage
that they've already done.

259
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:39,505
And I know this is against our traditions,
but the world is shrinking,

260
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:41,836

There's a whole generation out there
that don't want to hide anymore.

264
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:53,349
Have you already forgotten
that this plague

265
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,355
killed your own beloved mentor,

266
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,904
and you want to negotiate with them?

267
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:04,405
We gave your brother war powers
and made him Ocean Master for a reason.

268
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:09,118
If we ever decide to make ourselves known
to the surface dwellers,

269
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:13,167
it will be to eradicate them,
not to co-exist.

He's different now.
He's stronger than before.

And he can fight me

And where the hell did he get
all the new toys from?

The technology seems ancient,
but we've never seen anything like it.

431
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:11,607
That weapon he used
fires some kind of ultrasonic energy

432
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:13,229

Do we know what was stolen?

He escaped with a large stockpile
of orichalcum.

435
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:22,568
Am I supposed to know what that is?

436
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:25,825
Orichalcum is a power source
that was used in ancient times.

437
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:28,498
It emits tremendous amounts
of greenhouse gases

438
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:30,326
that are highly destructive to our planet.

439
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,208
In fact, we almost destroyed
the oceans ourselves

440
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:35,039
before we realized what we were doing.

441
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:39,547
It can't be disposed of safely,
so the remaining stockpile

442
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:43,222
has been buried in 12 storage vaults
deep underground.

443
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:45,049
Well, we should warn the other places
that are storing the stuff.

444
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:47,805
He's already been there.
It's all gone.

445
00:35:47,896 --> 00:35:51,639
We think he's been launching secret raids
for at least five months.

446
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,223
This is just the time he got caught.

447
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:56,902
Well, this spike in global temperatures
that's causing disasters on the surface

448
00:35:56,988 --> 00:36:01,152
and making the sea dwellers sick
happened five months ago.

449
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,944
He's using the stolen orichalcum
to heat the planet.

450
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,747
Why would he do that?

451
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,574
I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.

452
00:36:11,044 --> 00:36:13,126
If he is using the orichalcum
to heat the planet,

453
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:14,294
we don't have much time.

454
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:16,418
He is pushing this past the tipping point.

455
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:21,002
He must be stopped
or a global climate meltdown is imminent.

456
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:23,884
KING: We need to find him, but he has
completely vanished off the radar.

457
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:26,635
I think I know someone
who might be able to help us.

458
00:36:27,644 --> 00:36:29,055
But you're not gonna like it.

459
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:31,804
Your brother?

460
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:34,765
Believe me, he's the last person
I wanna go begging for help,

461
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,691
but he's dealt with Manta in the past,

462
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:39,019
and he's the only one who might know
how to find him in time.

463
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:42,197
The Fishermen will never allow you
to speak to Orm.

464
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,232
He killed their king.

465
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,403
I wasn't exactly gonna ask for permission.

466
00:36:47,497 --> 00:36:51,866
Arthur, Atlantis cannot extract Orm
from an allied nation.

467
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,167
It would be an act of war.

468
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,208
Atlantis isn't gonna do it.

469
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:00,044
I'm gonna break him out myself.

470
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:04,011
Arthur, Karshon is looking for a reason
to seize war powers.

471
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:06,714
You will be nothing more
than a figurehead if she does that.

472
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:09,516
My place is out there where I belong,
where I'm actually good at what I do.

473
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,809
I'm tired of nothing ever getting done.

474
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:14,062
I've got to do this.

475
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:18,146
