its host's neural processes.

One day this could end
violence as we know it.

They're safer apart

Well, seeing as you've been posing as

00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:30,906
my guess is that you have
hidden the fragment

That's not "Rest in peace."

Please be more specific.
That could be a very long list.

Okay, even assuming

00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:46,457
the Legion took the Spear fragment
from here,

- how did they know it was here?
- Without the Medallion, you mean.

Rip must have told them.

Somehow, he remembers where the pieces
of the Spear are.

92

Well, then it's a good thing
you let him escape.

Do you want to say something to me?

00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:02,645
Jax told me about how
he was going to kill Rip in 1776.

95
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:06,098
- And about how you stopped him.
- Because we're not killers, Amaya.

96

Except for yourself and Mr. Rory and...

97

I'm not condoning murder.

But the JSA would have captured Rip
without regard for sentiment.

100
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,950
You think I let Rip go
because of sentiment?

- Yes.
- All right, let's just all take a breath...

you put the whole of reality at risk.

And it's a good thing I did.

338
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,029
These components appear to be a set,

00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:10,863

transmitter and receiver.

Or commander and soldier.

341
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,949
Exactly.
The commander wears the transmitter,

342
00:19:15,112 --> 00:19:17,706
sending orders via
an electro-telepathic signal

343
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,708
to this receiver worn by the soldier.

344
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,460
Anything with a signal could get hacked.

345
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:22,791
That's the hope, yes.

346
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:26,753
So all we need to do is somehow boost the
brain power of whoever's wearing this...

347
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:31,422
Or find someone with
a preternaturally powerful brain.

Fine. If you insist.

- Precisely why we're leaving now.

there's no need for this medieval warfare.

491
00:27:39,867 --> 00:27:42,666
I get it now, Camelot isn't about history,

492
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:46,415
it's not even about some dusty old books
that got a lonely kid through childhood.

493
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:50,841
It's about one noble idea,

494

that we can all stand up for what's right,
no matter what.

I do. And Camelot's great,

498
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,273
but if you don't leave right now,
you're gonna die here.

499
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:09,438
Would it kill you to be
just a little bit more supportive?

500

You don't get it, man, I checked

It sounds to me like
the stuff legends are made of.

503
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:22,751
All right, Gideon.
Let's get ready for takeoff.

GIDEON: <i>Yes, Captain.</i>

505

This doesn't feel right.
We don't just leave people in trouble.

506
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:29,800
They're knights.
And they're fighting so we can get away.

507
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,052
- With the piece of the Spear.
- And without Rip.

508

Take comfort we live
to fight another day.

509
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:36,886
The Legion already has two pieces
of the Spear. I don't like it,

510
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:39,552
but we cannot risk them getting a Yahtzee.

511
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,223
What the hell is a Yahtzee?

512
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:44,731
GIDEON: <i>Systems online, Captain Lance.
We are ready to time jump.</i>

513
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,147
Where's Raymond?

514
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:51,905
With this sword, I dub thee.

Rise, good knight!

518
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:07,209
I tried talking to him, but he's hell-bent
on getting himself killed.

519
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:09,169
Doesn't he know we have
the piece of the Spear?

520
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:12,961
All he seems to care about is being
remembered in some BS bedtime story.

521
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:15,629
- We can't leave him behind.
- We're not leaving him. He chose to stay.

but this is seriously screwed up.

524
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,018
We can't risk losing a piece of the Spear,

525
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:25,021
especially when the Legion is backed
by evil Knights of the Round Table.

526
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,306
I thought you were going to
un-evilfy them.

00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,475
We were.
If we just had a little more time.

- And what happens if you can't?

my ass, I'm not gonna let him fight alone.

624
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:48,187
Tales of your deeds will honor these halls
for longer than you can imagine.

625
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,192
The honor is mine, Your Grace.

626
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,739
Hey, so you're staying?

627
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,916
- Like you, I've found a new home.
- "Like me"?

628
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,539
With the Legends. The team suits you.

629
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,956
Take care of yourself, Courtney.

630
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:17,296
You, too, Amaya.

631
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:24,728
- What was that all about?
- Just a little friendly advice.

632
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:25,929
Yeah?

633
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,390
We should get going. Where's Ray?

634
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:31,769
Um, he said something about paying his
respects to the Queen before we left.

635
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:36,489
Hmm.
Funny, Sara said the exact same thing.

636
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,068
I just wanted to say goodbye.

637
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,745
I enjoyed meeting you.

638
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:45,411
And I you, Sara Lance.

639
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:47,913
- A lot.
- (CHUCKLES)

640
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,911
Sara Lancelot...

641
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:53,961
I should go.

642
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:57,340
Do you really have to leave?

643
00:38:57,794 --> 00:39:02,015
It is I, Raymond of the Palms, my lady,
come to bid my fair lady adieu.

644
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:03,258
Oh.

645
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:07,270
Well, (CLEARS THROAT)
a thousand pardons, Your Majesty.

646
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,352
- Sara.
- It's okay, Ray. Come in.

647
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:12,609
And a thousand thanks
for your service to the realm.

648
00:39:13,101 --> 00:39:15,320
If ever your travels bring you back,

649
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:20,109
there will always be a seat at the
Round Table for Sir Raymond of the Palms.

650
00:39:21,818 --> 00:39:22,944
Thank you, my lady.

651
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:30,452
You know, every good legend
ends with a kiss.

652
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,972
Goodbye, Guinevere.

653
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:01,824
Surely, you must admit that it's not
a superior intelligence, but rather

654
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:05,370
the murky depths of your mind
that proved vital.

655
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:08,198
(BURPS) Just admit it,
my brain saved the day.

656
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,832
I will admit nothing of the sort!

657
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,326
All right, I'll admit it,

658
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:15,167
walking around a legend felt just as real
as walking around any part of history.

659
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:18,504
You know, maybe legend and history
are not so different after all.

660
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:19,758
Maybe they're just

661
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:22,967
stories to remind us where we
come from and who we can become.

662
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:25,048
- Hmm.
- So what do you say?

663
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:28,469
You wanna find out how you'll be
remembered in everyone's bedtime story?

664
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,011
Nah.

665
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,773
I think I'd rather make up
my future as I go.

666
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:35,350
Nice.

667
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,158
I've got something I want to say to you.

668
00:40:47,612 --> 00:40:50,365
Well, I'm a captive audience, aren't I?

669
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:54,623
I was gonna kill you
for what you did to Sara.

670
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,708
<i>But she stopped me,</i>

671
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,793
and I'm glad.

672
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,667
But make no mistake,

673
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:04,133
you are not captain
and this is not your ship.

674
00:41:04,337 --> 00:41:07,637
Not anymore. So if you even think

675
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:12,225
about hurting anyone on my team,
I will not hesitate to end you.

676
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:17,855
Feel good to get that
off your chest, did it?

677
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,913
- Gideon?
<i>- I'm here, Captain.</i>

678
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:39,881
You always are.

679
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,251
(SNICKERS)
