1
00:00:58,748 --> 00:00:59,616
Hurry!

2
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:12,411
Do you not understand?

3
00:02:12,895 --> 00:02:15,007
Krypton's core is collapsing,

4
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:17,198
we may only have a matter of weeks.

5
00:02:17,569 --> 00:02:18,572
I warned you.

6
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:20,703
Harvesting the core was suicide.

7
00:02:21,502 --> 00:02:23,887
It has accelerated
the process of implosion.

8
00:02:23,912 --> 00:02:26,777
Our energy reserves were exhausted.

9
00:02:26,778 --> 00:02:28,424
What would you have us do, El?

10
00:02:28,426 --> 00:02:29,774
Look to the stars,

11
00:02:30,071 --> 00:02:31,640
like our ancestors did.

12
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,734
There are habitable worlds within reach.

13
00:02:34,241 --> 00:02:36,039
We can begin by using the old outposts.

14
00:02:36,206 --> 00:02:39,665
Are you seriously suggesting
that we evacuate the entire planet?

15
00:02:39,667 --> 00:02:40,233
No.

16
00:02:40,758 --> 00:02:42,946
Everybody here is already dead.

17
00:02:44,323 --> 00:02:45,807
Give me control of the Codex.

18
00:02:46,155 --> 00:02:48,226
I will ensure the survival of our race.

19
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:49,939
There is still hope.

20
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:52,506
I have held that hope in my hands.

21
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:09,628
This council has been disbanded.

22
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:11,900
On whose authority?

23
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:13,397
Mine.

24
00:03:17,521 --> 00:03:19,303
The rest of you will be tried,

25
00:03:19,305 --> 00:03:21,100
and punished accordingly.

26
00:03:23,137 --> 00:03:24,281
What are you doing, Zod?

27
00:03:24,511 --> 00:03:25,420
This is madness.

28
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:26,948
What I should have done years ago.

29
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:29,722
These lawmakers
with their endless debates,

30
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,636
have lead Krypton to ruin.

31
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:35,954
And if your forces prevail,

32
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,856
you'll be the leader of nothing.
Then join me.

33
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:40,794
Help me save our race.

34
00:03:41,181 --> 00:03:42,317
We'll start a new.

35
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,665
We'll sever,

36
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:46,821
the degenerative bloodlines
that led us to this state.

37
00:03:46,953 --> 00:03:49,291
And who will decide
which bloodlines survive, Zod?

38
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:52,366
You?

39
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,407
Don't do this, El.

40
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,229
The last thing I want
is for us to be enemies.

41
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:02,029
You have abandoned the principles
that bound us together.

42
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:03,754
You've taken up the sword,

43
00:04:03,772 --> 00:04:05,311
against your own people.

44
00:04:06,214 --> 00:04:08,613
I will honor the man
you once were Zod.

45
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,542
Not this monster you've become.

46
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,282
Take him away.

47
00:04:22,665 --> 00:04:23,208
<i>Sir?</i>

48
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,380
<i>Is everything alright?</i>

49
00:04:24,382 --> 00:04:25,305
Out of the way.

50
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,421
I said...

51
00:04:43,887 --> 00:04:44,922
Get me Lara.

52
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:47,958
<i>Jor. Behind you.</i>

53
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,261
Lara, you have to ready the launch.

54
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,167
I'll be with you as soon as I can.

55
00:05:11,219 --> 00:05:12,391
H'Raka!

56
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:25,405
Go!

57
00:05:51,605 --> 00:05:52,605
Can you see the Codex?

58
00:05:52,699 --> 00:05:54,467
<i>It's just beneath the central hub, Sir.</i>

59
00:05:54,475 --> 00:05:55,750
<i>But I'm compelled to warn you.</i>

60
00:05:55,825 --> 00:05:58,334
<i>Breaching the genesis chamber
is a Class-B crime...</i>

61
00:05:58,397 --> 00:05:59,930
Nobody cares anymore, Kelex.

62
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,147
The world is about to come to an end.

63
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:09,655
<i>Jar-El, by the authority of General Zod,</i>

64
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,509
<i>surrender the Codex.</i>

65
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,173
Easy, H'Raka.

66
00:08:22,283 --> 00:08:23,356
Did you find a world?

67
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,339
We have.

68
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,346
<i>Orbiting a main sequence yellow star,</i>

69
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:28,795
<i>just as you said it would.</i>

70
00:08:29,782 --> 00:08:31,149
A young star.

71
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,571
His cells will drink its radiation.

72
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,764
It's a seemingly intelligent population.

73
00:08:39,888 --> 00:08:40,958
He'll be an outcast.

74
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:43,023
A freak.

75
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:45,557
They'll kill him.

76
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:46,620
How?

77
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:49,100
He'll be a god to them.

78
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:53,055
What if the ship doesn't make it?

79
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,035
He'll die out there...

80
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:57,943
alone.

81
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:01,440
I can't do it.

82
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,452
I thought I could, but...

83
00:09:03,741 --> 00:09:05,297
Lara.
Now that he's here...

84
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,349
Krypton is doomed.

85
00:09:08,738 --> 00:09:10,391
It's his only chance now.

86
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,954
It's our people's only hope.

87
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:15,627
What is it, Kelex?

88
00:09:15,782 --> 00:09:17,869
<i>Five attack ships
converging from the east.</i>

89
00:09:18,235 --> 00:09:20,709
<i>Citadel's defenses
are being scanned and evaluated.</i>

90
00:09:20,787 --> 00:09:21,902
I'll upload the Codex.

91
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:23,584
No, wait.

92
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,260
Lara.

93
00:09:25,785 --> 00:09:27,890
Just let me look at him.

94
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,876
We'll never get to see him walk.

95
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,310
Never hear him say our names.

96
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:45,188
But out there...

97
00:09:45,898 --> 00:09:47,181
amongst the stars...

98
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,192
he will live.

99
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:49,856
Goodbye, my son.

100
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:53,141
Our hopes and dreams travel with you.

101
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:34,716
Concentrate fire on the main doors.

102
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:51,776
<i>Lady Lara.</i>

103
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:53,461
<i>The phantom drives are coming online.</i>

104
00:11:53,607 --> 00:11:54,874
Proceed to ignition.

105
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:56,616
General.

106
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:59,605
We have identified an engine ignition
within the citadel.

107
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,289
A launch.

108
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,478
Hold this platform, commander.

109
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,251
I know you stole the Codex, Jor-El.

110
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:22,797
Surrender it,

111
00:12:23,238 --> 00:12:24,727
and I'll let you live.

112
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,920
This is a second chance
for all of Krypton,

113
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:30,645
not just the bloodlines you deem worthy.

114
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,424
What have you done?

115
00:12:34,181 --> 00:12:35,522
We've had a child, Zod.

116
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,043
A boy child.

117
00:12:38,808 --> 00:12:41,154
Krypton's first natural birth in centuries.

118
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:44,082
And he will be free.

119
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,715
Free to forge his own destiny.

120
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,102
Heresy.

121
00:12:51,197 --> 00:12:52,021
Destroy it.

122
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,534
Lara, listen to me.

123
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:51,893
The Codex is Krypton's future.

124
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,971
Abort the launch.

125
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,041
No!

126
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:46,892
Your son Lara,

127
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,615
where have you sent him?

128
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:54,976
His name,

129
00:14:55,866 --> 00:14:56,699
is Kal,

130
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:58,598
son of El.

131
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,473
And he's beyond your reach.

132
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:16,783
Bring that ship down.

133
00:15:25,326 --> 00:15:26,373
<i>Target locked.</i>

134
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:39,783
<i>Lay down your weapons.</i>

135
00:15:39,837 --> 00:15:41,908
<i>Your forces are surrounded.</i>

136
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,597
General Zod,

137
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,596
for the crimes
of murder and high treason,

138
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:58,763
the Council has sentenced you

139
00:15:59,418 --> 00:16:01,245
and your fellow insurgents,

140
00:16:01,396 --> 00:16:04,866
to three hundred cycles
of somatic reconditioning.

141
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,299
Do you have any last words?

142
00:16:10,925 --> 00:16:12,657
You won't kill us yourself!

143
00:16:13,195 --> 00:16:14,644
You wouldn'l sully your hands!

144
00:16:14,942 --> 00:16:17,748
But you'll damn us
to a black hole for eternity!

145
00:16:19,985 --> 00:16:21,460
Jor-El was right.

146
00:16:21,825 --> 00:16:23,602
You're a pack of fools,

147
00:16:23,604 --> 00:16:25,323
every last one of you.

148
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:27,246
And you.

149
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,208
You believe your son is safe?

150
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,705
I will find him.

151
00:16:34,386 --> 00:16:36,132
I will reclaim,

152
00:16:36,318 --> 00:16:37,659
what you have taken from us.

153
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:41,193
I will find him.

154
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:44,658
I will find him, Lara.

155
00:16:48,137 --> 00:16:50,012
I will find him!

156
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:32,793
<i>Lady Lara,</i>

157
00:18:33,684 --> 00:18:35,035
<i>should not you find refuge?</i>

158
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,880
There is no refuge, Kelor.

159
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:41,050
Jor-El was right.

160
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:45,174
This is the end.

161
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,889
Make a better world than ours, Kal.

162
00:20:32,593 --> 00:20:33,933
Watch it, dumb-ass!

163
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:36,160
Keep your eyes open
or you're gonna get squashed.

164
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,894
Where the hell did they find you,
greenhorn?

165
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:43,258
Let's get this trap in the air.

166
00:20:43,344 --> 00:20:44,945
<i>Gentlemen, secure the deck.</i>

167
00:20:44,964 --> 00:20:48,076
We just got a distress call
from a rig due west of us.

168
00:20:48,341 --> 00:20:49,732
Secure the deck.

169
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,189
<i>All civilian boats, stand clear.</i>

170
00:20:56,327 --> 00:20:58,902
<i>The sub-sea valves failed
and the rig is about to explode.</i>

171
00:20:58,918 --> 00:20:59,812
Roger, Coast Guard.

172
00:20:59,814 --> 00:21:01,694
What about the men left inside?
Over.

173
00:21:01,771 --> 00:21:03,283
<i>Forget them. They're dead.</i>

174
00:21:03,425 --> 00:21:05,777
Greenhorn fetch me my binoculars.

175
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:08,600
Greenhorn.

176
00:21:17,956 --> 00:21:19,238
This is the last of the oxygen.

177
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,389
I don't know how much
longer we can hold out.

178
00:21:30,575 --> 00:21:32,332
<i>This is Coast Guard 6510.</i>

179
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:34,305
<i>We'll make one more
pass then get out.</i>

180
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:38,867
Wait, wait.
I got some guys on the helipad.

181
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,131
Right here!

182
00:21:45,271 --> 00:21:47,148
Come on, come on, come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

183
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:49,039
Come on! Come on!

184
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:01,727
<i>Get that last guy loaded.</i>

185
00:22:01,729 --> 00:22:02,679
<i>We have got to go.</i>

186
00:22:02,703 --> 00:22:04,502
Hey, let's go. What are you doing?

187
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:11,633
Go! Go!

188
00:22:49,901 --> 00:22:51,938
<i>When Kansas became a territory?</i>

189
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:54,772
<i>Clark.</i>

190
00:22:57,358 --> 00:22:58,493
<i>Are you listening, Clark?</i>

191
00:23:03,259 --> 00:23:05,542
<i>I asked if you could tell me
who first settled Kansas.</i>

192
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:20,837
Are you alright, Clark?

193
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:29,888
Clark!

194
00:23:31,461 --> 00:23:32,301
Clark!

195
00:23:36,651 --> 00:23:37,393
Clark!

196
00:23:41,148 --> 00:23:42,684
Clark, come out of there.

197
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,309
Leave me alone.

198
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:47,035
Clark, I have called your mother.

199
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,097
Clark?

200
00:23:52,331 --> 00:23:53,332
I'm here.

201
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,357
Clark, honey, it's Mom.

202
00:23:58,196 --> 00:23:59,231
Will you open the door?

203
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,308
What's wrong with him?
He's such a freak.

204
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:02,473
<i>Crybaby.</i>

205
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:05,020
<i>His parents won't even let him play
with other kids.</i>

206
00:24:05,308 --> 00:24:06,309
I know.

207
00:24:06,512 --> 00:24:07,512
Sweetie.

208
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:10,653
How can I help you if you won't let me in?

209
00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:12,694
The world's too big, Mom.

210
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:14,700
Then make it small.

211
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:18,214
Just...

212
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:23,088
focus on my voice.

213
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:27,210
Pretend ifs an island...

214
00:24:27,943 --> 00:24:29,261
out in the ocean.

215
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:32,008
Can you see it?

216
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:36,843
I see it.

217
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:39,914
Then swim towards it, honey.

218
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:55,118
What's wrong with me, Mom?

219
00:24:58,132 --> 00:24:58,991
Clark.

220
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:31,705
Did you get everything I need?
Yep.

221
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,267
Hold it, hold it.

222
00:26:23,449 --> 00:26:24,807
Hey, ass-wipe.

223
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:26,914
What do you think?
You see the game?

224
00:26:27,842 --> 00:26:30,145
Leave him alone, Pete.
What are you, his girlfriend?

225
00:26:30,604 --> 00:26:31,888
I wanna hear what he has to say.

226
00:26:34,136 --> 00:26:35,136
Come on...

227
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,018
dick-splash.

228
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,158
My son was there.

229
00:28:18,257 --> 00:28:19,956
He was in the bus.

230
00:28:20,227 --> 00:28:22,158
He saw what Clark did.

231
00:28:22,604 --> 00:28:23,483
I know he did.

232
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:25,113
I'm sure.

233
00:28:25,309 --> 00:28:28,275
I'm sure what he thought he saw was...
Was an act of God, Jonathan.

234
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:31,279
This was providence.

235
00:28:35,889 --> 00:28:37,927
Well, I think you're blowing it
a little out of the proportion.

236
00:28:37,929 --> 00:28:39,094
No, I'm not.

237
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:41,207
Lana saw it too.

238
00:28:41,444 --> 00:28:42,454
And the Fordham boy.

239
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:44,039
And this isn't the first time,

240
00:28:44,041 --> 00:28:45,676
Clark's done something like this.

241
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,624
I just wanted to help.

242
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:05,849
I know you did,
but we talked about this.

243
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:07,323
Right?

244
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,417
Right? We talked about this.
You have...

245
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:14,445
Clark, you have to keep this side
of yourself a secret.

246
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:16,876
What was I supposed to do?

247
00:29:17,605 --> 00:29:18,534
Just let them die?

248
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:24,997
Maybe.

249
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:29,835
There's more at stake here
than just our lives, Clark,

250
00:29:29,837 --> 00:29:31,405
or the lives of those around us.

251
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:35,473
When the world...

252
00:29:36,857 --> 00:29:40,106
When the world finds out what you can do,
it's going to change everything. Our...

253
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,053
Our beliefs, our notions of...

254
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,921
what it means to be human.
Everything.

255
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:48,972
You saw how Pete's mom reacted, right?

256
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,404
She was scared, Clark.

257
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,125
Why?

258
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:58,352
People are afraid
of what they don't understand.

259
00:29:58,930 --> 00:29:59,930
Is she right?

260
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:03,488
Did God do this to me?

261
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:06,326
Tell me!

262
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,091
We found you in this.

263
00:30:25,766 --> 00:30:28,237
We were sure the government
was gonna show up on our doorstep,

264
00:30:28,781 --> 00:30:30,245
but no one ever came.

265
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:46,649
This was in that chamber with you.

266
00:30:49,573 --> 00:30:51,754
I took it to a metallurgist at Kansas State.

267
00:30:52,384 --> 00:30:54,532
He said, whatever it was made
from didn't even...

268
00:30:56,089 --> 00:30:58,246
didn't even exist on the periodic table.

269
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:03,697
It's another way of saying that
it's not from this world, Clark.

270
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:07,583
And neither are you.

271
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:11,625
You're the answer, son.

272
00:31:12,581 --> 00:31:14,882
You're the answer to, Are we alone
in the universe?

273
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:18,028
I don't wanna be.

274
00:31:18,613 --> 00:31:20,118
And I don't blame you, son.

275
00:31:20,987 --> 00:31:23,257
It'd be a huge burden for anyone to bare,

276
00:31:23,259 --> 00:31:26,172
but you're not just anyone, Clark.
And I have to believe that you were...

277
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,263
that you were sent here for a reason.

278
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:33,935
All these changes that
you're going through one day...

279
00:31:34,494 --> 00:31:37,446
one day you're gonna think of them
as a blessing. And when that day comes,

280
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,085
you're gonna have to make a choice.

281
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:43,427
A choice of whether to stand proud
in front of the human race or not.

282
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,861
Can I just keep pretending I'm your son?

283
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,180
You are my son.

284
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:56,599
But somewhere out there you...

285
00:31:57,913 --> 00:32:00,566
You have another father too,
who gave you another name.

286
00:32:04,528 --> 00:32:06,425
And he sent you here for a reason, Clark.

287
00:32:08,916 --> 00:32:12,323
And even if it takes you the rest of your life,
you owe it to yourself,

288
00:32:12,325 --> 00:32:14,215
To find out what that reason is.

289
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:32,602
Wait a second.
Aren't you here fer the exercise?

290
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:34,357
No, there was a change in the plans.

291
00:32:34,366 --> 00:32:37,126
Because somebody found something
strange on Ellesmere.

292
00:32:37,382 --> 00:32:39,336
Aircom's making
runs out there all week.

293
00:32:39,338 --> 00:32:40,527
That rat hole?
You got to be kidding me.

294
00:32:40,529 --> 00:32:42,019
I know. It's crazy, right?

295
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:44,382
The Americans are there too,
lots of them.

296
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:46,936
Anything else?
They're calling it an anomalous object.

297
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,650
Whatever that means.
Back off, Ludlow. I'm serious.

298
00:32:49,703 --> 00:32:51,835
Oh, come on, Chrissy.
Knock it off.

299
00:32:51,868 --> 00:32:53,503
Sit down.
Let me go.

300
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:55,362
Hey. Leave her alone, man.

301
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:01,218
Or what, tough guy?

302
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,565
Or...

303
00:33:03,723 --> 00:33:05,194
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

304
00:33:06,532 --> 00:33:07,662
I think,

305
00:33:07,664 --> 00:33:09,732
I'll probably just leave
when I'm good and ready.

306
00:33:19,514 --> 00:33:20,907
Oh, there he is.

307
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:29,977
It's not worth it, sweetie.

308
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,351
Hey, asshole, don't forget your tip.

309
00:33:43,163 --> 00:33:44,217
Still strike.

310
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:36,418
Thanks.

311
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:38,451
Hi.

312
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,066
Miss Lane.

313
00:34:40,324 --> 00:34:41,579
How you doing?
Good.

314
00:34:41,656 --> 00:34:43,405
Jed Eubanks, Arctic Cargo.

315
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:45,294
How far to the station?

316
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:47,734
Camp's just over the rise.

317
00:34:47,759 --> 00:34:49,347
I'll walk you over.
Great.

318
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:51,518
Joe can take your bags. Joe?

319
00:34:52,057 --> 00:34:53,084
Help her out.

320
00:34:53,651 --> 00:34:55,585
Careful with those, they are heavy.

321
00:34:58,534 --> 00:35:00,172
I got to confess, Miss Lane.

322
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:02,598
I'm not a fan of the Daily Planet.

323
00:35:03,635 --> 00:35:07,057
But those pieces you wrote when you were
embedded with the 1st Division were...

324
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,484
Well, they were pretty impressive.

325
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:11,277
Well, what can I say,

326
00:35:11,279 --> 00:35:13,913
I get writer's block if I'm
not wearing a flak jacket.

327
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:20,619
Miss Lane.

328
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:22,622
I'm Colonel Hardy, U.S. Northcom.

329
00:35:22,624 --> 00:35:24,604
Dr. Emil Hamilton from DARPA.

330
00:35:25,037 --> 00:35:26,209
You're early.
Hi.

331
00:35:26,851 --> 00:35:28,136
We were expecting you tomorrow.

332
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:30,244
Which is why I showed up today.

333
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:33,902
Look let's get, one thing straight
guys ok?

334
00:35:33,962 --> 00:35:36,806
The only reason I'm here
is because we're on Canadian soil,

335
00:35:36,808 --> 00:35:39,669
and the appellate court overruled
your injunction to keep me away.

336
00:35:40,723 --> 00:35:41,681
So if we're...

337
00:35:41,778 --> 00:35:43,129
we're done measuring dicks,

338
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,202
can you have your people
show me what you found?

339
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:51,014
NASA's ER satellites
pinged the anomaly first.

340
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,164
The ice shelf plays hell
on the echo soundings.

341
00:35:53,166 --> 00:35:55,255
But there is definitely
something down there.

342
00:35:55,257 --> 00:35:56,941
A submarine, maybe from Soviet era?

343
00:35:57,187 --> 00:35:58,791
Doubtful. That's 300 meters.

344
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,871
Considerably larger than anything
we know they built back then.

345
00:36:02,228 --> 00:36:03,468
But herds the spooky pan.

346
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:06,830
The ice surrounding the object...

347
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:09,900
it's nearly twenty thousand years old.

348
00:36:11,921 --> 00:36:12,921
Miss Lane?

349
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,313
Try not to wander.

350
00:36:15,685 --> 00:36:18,249
Temperatures drop to minus 40
at night around here.

351
00:36:18,877 --> 00:36:20,699
Wouldn't find your body till after spring.

352
00:36:24,031 --> 00:36:25,286
And there you go.

353
00:36:29,055 --> 00:36:30,136
What if I need to tinkle?

354
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:32,753
There's a bucket in the corner.

355
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,995
Where the hell are you going?

356
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:19,645
Hello?

357
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:57,169
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright.

358
00:40:57,542 --> 00:40:58,251
It's alright.

359
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:14,605
You're hemorrhaging internally.

360
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,929
Now if I don't cauterize this bleed...

361
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:19,493
Yeah ok.

362
00:41:19,843 --> 00:41:21,580
I can do things that other people can't.

363
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,180
Now hold my hand.

364
00:41:25,258 --> 00:41:26,366
This is gonna hurt.

365
00:42:28,586 --> 00:42:32,250
While Colonel Hardy and his team
surmised was a Soviet-era submarine,

366
00:42:32,517 --> 00:42:34,901
it was actually something
much more exotic.

367
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:39,151
An isotope analysis of the surrounding
ice bores suggests that an object,

368
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:42,783
had been trapped in the glacier
for over 18,000 years.

369
00:42:43,557 --> 00:42:45,093
As for my rescuer,

370
00:42:45,196 --> 00:42:47,574
he disappeared during
the object's departure.

371
00:42:48,171 --> 00:42:50,600
A background check revealed
that his work history

372
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:52,458
and identity had been falsified.

373
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:55,948
The questions raised
by my rescuers existence

374
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:57,560
are frightening to contemplate,

375
00:42:57,858 --> 00:42:59,979
but I also know what I saw.

376
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:03,847
And I have arrived
at the inescapable conclusion,

377
00:43:03,848 --> 00:43:05,633
that the object and its occupant,

378
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,723
did not originate on Earth.

379
00:43:09,625 --> 00:43:12,649
I can't print this, Lois.
You might have hallucinated half of it.

380
00:43:12,677 --> 00:43:15,783
What about the contractors
who corroborated my story?

381
00:43:15,785 --> 00:43:18,266
The Pentagon is denying
that there was a ship.

382
00:43:18,269 --> 00:43:19,347
Of course they are.

383
00:43:19,551 --> 00:43:21,824
That's what they're supposed to do,
it's the Pentagon.

384
00:43:22,733 --> 00:43:24,501
Perry, it's me we're talking about.

385
00:43:24,502 --> 00:43:27,230
I'm a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter.
Then act like it.

386
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,577
Print it or I walk.
You can't.

387
00:43:29,627 --> 00:43:30,712
You're under contract.

388
00:43:33,311 --> 00:43:35,012
I'm not running a story about...

389
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:37,354
aliens walking among us.

390
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:44,789
Never gonna happen.

391
00:43:48,107 --> 00:43:50,235
That's a scotch straight up for the lady.

392
00:43:50,743 --> 00:43:52,386
I'm sending you the original article.

393
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,632
My editor won't print it,
but if it happened to leak online.

394
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:56,720
Got it.

395
00:43:56,968 --> 00:43:57,720
But,

396
00:43:57,933 --> 00:44:00,241
didn't you once describe my site as,

397
00:44:00,765 --> 00:44:02,872
a creeping cancer of falsehoods?

398
00:44:03,010 --> 00:44:04,716
I stand by my words Woodburn,

399
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,510
but I want this story out there.

400
00:44:06,534 --> 00:44:07,380
Why?

401
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:10,652
Because I want my mystery man
to know I know the truth.

402
00:44:25,826 --> 00:44:27,806
<i>Recursive diagnostics complete.</i>

403
00:44:28,466 --> 00:44:30,673
<i>Guiding presence authenticated.</i>

404
00:44:31,032 --> 00:44:33,048
<i>All systems operational.</i>

405
00:44:45,396 --> 00:44:48,834
To see you standing there
having grown into an adult...

406
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:53,865
If only Lara could have witnessed this.

407
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:55,898
Who are you?

408
00:44:56,996 --> 00:44:58,520
I am your father, Kal.

409
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:02,108
Or at least a shadow of him.

410
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,939
His conscience.

411
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:07,270
My name,

412
00:45:07,631 --> 00:45:08,958
was Jor-El.

413
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:13,007
And Kal?

414
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:17,953
That's my name.

415
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:20,037
Kal-El,

416
00:45:20,814 --> 00:45:21,788
it is.

417
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:24,365
I have so many questions.

418
00:45:27,525 --> 00:45:28,912
Where do I come from?

419
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:32,358
Why did you send me here?

420
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:35,038
You came from Krypton.

421
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:39,229
A world,

422
00:45:39,841 --> 00:45:42,141
with a much harsher
environment than Earths.

423
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:47,130
Long ago...

424
00:45:47,812 --> 00:45:49,658
in an era of expansion...

425
00:45:50,281 --> 00:45:51,404
our race,

426
00:45:51,503 --> 00:45:53,007
spread out through the stars,

427
00:45:53,883 --> 00:45:55,993
seeking new worlds to settle upon.

428
00:45:57,766 --> 00:46:00,690
This scout ship was one of thousands
launched into the void.

429
00:46:03,661 --> 00:46:05,088
We built outposts,

430
00:46:05,207 --> 00:46:06,385
on other planets,

431
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:09,532
using great machines to reshape
environments to our needs.

432
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,340
For 100,000 years,

433
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:16,644
our civilization flourished,

434
00:46:17,904 --> 00:46:19,409
accomplishing wonders.

435
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:22,280
What happened?

436
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:27,407
Artificial population control
was established.

437
00:46:28,805 --> 00:46:31,596
The outposts on space exploration
were abandoned.

438
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,691
We exhausted our natural resources.

439
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:36,892
As a result,

440
00:46:37,756 --> 00:46:39,715
our planet's core became unstable.

441
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:44,407
Eventually, our military leader,

442
00:46:45,132 --> 00:46:46,303
General Zod,

443
00:46:47,061 --> 00:46:48,220
attempted a coup.

444
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:52,285
But by then it was too late.

445
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:56,416
Your mother and I foresaw
the coming calamity,

446
00:46:57,014 --> 00:46:59,824
and we took certain steps
to ensure your survival.

447
00:47:01,886 --> 00:47:03,524
This is a genesis chamber.

448
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:07,459
All Kryptonians were conceived
in chambers such as this.

449
00:47:07,932 --> 00:47:11,641
Every child was designed to fulfill
a pare-determined role in our society...

450
00:47:11,729 --> 00:47:12,729
as a worker,

451
00:47:13,155 --> 00:47:13,973
a warrior,

452
00:47:14,136 --> 00:47:15,580
a leader and so on.

453
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:19,339
Your mother and I believed Krypton
lost something precious.

454
00:47:19,704 --> 00:47:21,911
The element of choice, of chance.

455
00:47:22,654 --> 00:47:24,779
What if a child dreamed
of becoming something,

456
00:47:24,781 --> 00:47:27,135
mother than what society
had intended for him or her?

457
00:47:29,074 --> 00:47:30,972
What if a child aspired
to something greater?

458
00:47:32,093 --> 00:47:34,251
You were the embodiment
of that belief, Kal.

459
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,998
Krypton's first natural birth in centuries.

460
00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:40,229
That's why we risked so much
to save you.

461
00:47:41,892 --> 00:47:43,214
Why didn't you come with me?

462
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,166
We couldn't, Kal.

463
00:47:50,105 --> 00:47:51,828
No matter how much we wanted to.

464
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:54,279
No matter how much we loved you.

465
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:57,050
Your mother Lara, and I...

466
00:47:57,155 --> 00:48:00,111
were a product of the failures
of our world as much as Zod was.

467
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:01,804
We were tied to its fate.

468
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:04,350
So I'm alone.
No.

469
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,072
You're as much a child of Earth now,

470
00:48:08,074 --> 00:48:09,458
as you are of Krypton.

471
00:48:10,129 --> 00:48:12,462
You can embody the best of both worlds.

472
00:48:13,424 --> 00:48:16,331
A dream your mother and I
dedicated our lives to preserve.

473
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,580
The people of Earth
are different from us, it's true.

474
00:48:25,091 --> 00:48:27,118
But ultimately
I believe that's a good thing.

475
00:48:27,834 --> 00:48:30,288
They won't necessarily
make the same mistakes we did.

476
00:48:30,985 --> 00:48:32,286
Not if you guide them, Kal.

477
00:48:34,085 --> 00:48:35,750
Not if you give them hope.

478
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:41,177
That's what this symbol means.

479
00:48:42,553 --> 00:48:44,609
The symbol of the house of El
means hope.

480
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:47,846
Embodied within that hope
is the fundamental belief,

481
00:48:47,892 --> 00:48:51,360
in the potential of every person
to be a force for good.

482
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,653
That's what you can bring them.

483
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:16,880
<i>Why am I so different from them?</i>

484
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:21,258
<i>Earth's sun is younger and brighter
than Krypton's was.</i>

485
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:24,891
<i>Your cells have drunken its radiation,</i>

486
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:26,789
<i>strengthening your muscles,</i>

487
00:49:27,313 --> 00:49:29,009
<i>your skin, your senses.</i>

488
00:49:29,834 --> 00:49:31,481
<i>Earth's gravity is weaker,</i>

489
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:33,840
<i>yet its atmosphere is more nourishing.</i>

490
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:37,700
<i>You've grown stronger here
than I ever could have imagine.</i>

491
00:49:38,523 --> 00:49:40,127
<i>The only way to know how strong,</i>

492
00:49:41,045 --> 00:49:43,727
<i>is to keep testing your limits.</i>

493
00:50:36,663 --> 00:50:38,183
<i>You will give the people of Earth</i>

494
00:50:38,185 --> 00:50:40,233
<i>an ideal to strive towards.</i>

495
00:50:41,981 --> 00:50:43,541
<i>They'll race behind you.</i>

496
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:45,551
<i>They will stumble.</i>

497

<i>They will fall.</i>

498
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:48,452
<i>But in time,</i>

499
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:52,545
<i>they will join you in the sun, Kal.</i>

500
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:55,754
<i>In time...</i>

501
00:50:56,587 --> 00:50:57,935
<i>you will help them,</i>

502
00:50:58,327 --> 00:50:59,584
<i>accomplish wonders.</i>

503
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:25,553
<font color="#00ffff"><i>How do you find someone who has

504
00:52:25,943 --> 00:52:28,010
<font color="#00ffff"><i>You start with the urban legends</i></font>

505
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:29,337

506
00:52:29,361 --> 00:52:30,162
That's Joe.

<font color="#00ffff"><i>All of the friends of a friend

508
00:52:32,965 --> 00:52:34,042
He worked here.

509
00:52:34,132 --> 00:52:36,032
<font color="#00ffff"><i>For some he was a guardian angel.</i></font>

510
00:52:36,627 --> 00:52:38,248

00:52:38,329 --> 00:52:40,107
<font color="#00ffff"><i>a ghost who never quite fit in.</i></font>

512
00:52:40,224 --> 00:52:42,965
Well, I was saying we were
coming towards the oil rig.

513
00:52:42,976 --> 00:52:44,743
<font color="#00ffff"><i>As you work your

514
00:52:44,745 --> 00:52:47,141

515
00:52:47,158 --> 00:52:49,229
I'm looking for a Pete Ross.
Do you know him?

516
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:50,762
Yeah, he works at the IHOP.

517
00:52:51,387 --> 00:52:52,715
If you go down the road...

518
00:52:54,138 --> 00:52:55,138
Pete Ross?

519
00:52:57,174 --> 00:53:00,643
I'd like to talk to you about an accident
that occurred when you were younger.

520
00:53:00,644 --> 00:53:02,663
A school bus that went into the river.

521
00:53:08,652 --> 00:53:09,535
Dusty.

522
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:11,991
Mrs. Kent?

523
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:15,269
I'm Lois Lane. I'm from the Daily Planet.

524
00:53:16,226 --> 00:53:17,226
Quite!

525
00:53:18,262 --> 00:53:19,888
I'm from the Daily Planet

526
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:21,603
and I'd like to talk to you about your son.

527
00:53:39,982 --> 00:53:43,027
I figured if I turned over enough stones
you'd eventually find me.

528
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:50,709
Where are you from?

529
00:53:51,934 --> 00:53:54,073
What are you doing here?
Let me tell your story.

530
00:53:54,298 --> 00:53:55,079
What,

531
00:53:55,749 --> 00:53:57,439
if I don't want my story told?

532
00:53:57,451 --> 00:53:59,094
It's going to come out eventually.

533
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:02,870
Somebody's gonna get a photograph
or figure out where you live.

534
00:54:03,142 --> 00:54:04,836
Well then I'll just disappear again.

535
00:54:04,838 --> 00:54:06,461
The only way you can disappear for good,

536
00:54:06,463 --> 00:54:08,095
is to stop helping people all together,

537
00:54:08,097 --> 00:54:10,139
and I sense that's not an option for you.

538
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:15,750
My father believed,

539
00:54:16,551 --> 00:54:18,424
that if the world found
out who I really was,

540
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:21,568
they'd reject me,

541
00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:23,249
out of fear.

542
00:54:25,953 --> 00:54:27,820
I'm tired of safe.

543
00:54:28,132 --> 00:54:30,237
I just wanna do something useful
with my life.

544
00:54:30,467 --> 00:54:32,307
So farming, feeding people, that's not...

545
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:33,502
that's not useful?

546
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:34,503
I didn't say that.

547
00:54:34,504 --> 00:54:37,044
Our family's been farming
for five generations, Clark.

548
00:54:37,174 --> 00:54:38,663
Your family, not mine.

549
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:42,123
I don't even know why I'm listening
to you, ou're not my dad.

550
00:54:42,146 --> 00:54:43,777
You're just some guy
who found me in a field.

551
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:44,729
Clark!

552
00:54:47,191 --> 00:54:48,581
It's alright, Martha.

553
00:54:50,821 --> 00:54:52,335
He's right. Clark has a point.

554
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:54,927
We're not your parents,

555
00:54:56,588 --> 00:54:58,967
but we've been doing the best we can
and we've...

556
00:54:59,187 --> 00:55:01,779
been making this up as we go along,
so maybe...

557
00:55:02,260 --> 00:55:04,511
maybe our best
isn't good enough any more.

558
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:10,470
Look,

559
00:55:11,211 --> 00:55:11,865
Dad...

560
00:55:11,942 --> 00:55:12,776
Hold on.

561
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:34,592
Go for the overpass.

562
00:55:36,633 --> 00:55:38,046
Go for the overpass!

563
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:41,708
Take cover! Take cover!

564
00:55:42,151 --> 00:55:43,502
Over there. Just follow them.

565
00:55:43,684 --> 00:55:44,710
Take cover.

566
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:49,250
She's stuck.

567
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:55,345
Hank's still in the car.

568
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:57,555
Hank's in the car.

569
00:55:58,422 --> 00:56:00,561
I'll get him, I'll get him.
No, no.

570
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:02,749
Get your mom to the overpass.

571
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:23,680
Hank! Hank! Come!

572
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:33,628
Jonathan!
Mom, ifs ok.

573
00:56:54,645 --> 00:56:56,254
Jonathan!
Mom, stay here.

574
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:24,408
Dad!

575
00:57:27,072 --> 00:57:28,373
I let my father die,

576
00:57:28,957 --> 00:57:30,060
because I trusted him.

577
00:57:30,914 --> 00:57:32,641
Because he was convinced,

578
00:57:33,066 --> 00:57:34,481
that I had to wait.

579
00:57:35,585 --> 00:57:37,594
That the world was not ready.

580
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:40,687
What do you think?

581
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:47,667
You better watch out, Lois.

582
00:57:48,165 --> 00:57:50,475
Hey, Perry's gunning for you.

583
00:57:50,701 --> 00:57:54,778
He knows you're Woodburns anonymous
source and cannot wait to rip you a new one.

584
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:57,901
Oh, look at her.

585
00:58:00,277 --> 00:58:01,883
I told you not to run with this,

586
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:03,113
and what do you do?

587
00:58:03,147 --> 00:58:05,630
You let Wood burn just shotgun it
all over the Internet.

588
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:07,869
Now the publishers want me,

589
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,076
to sue you.

590
00:58:09,211 --> 00:58:10,731
Well, if it makes a difference,

591
00:58:10,965 --> 00:58:12,210
I'm dropping it.

592
00:58:12,456 --> 00:58:13,269
Just like that?

593
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:14,427
Yep.

594
00:58:15,406 --> 00:58:16,666
What happened to your leads?

595
00:58:17,027 --> 00:58:18,140
They didn't pan out.

596
00:58:18,449 --> 00:58:19,668
The story is smoke.

597
00:58:19,794 --> 00:58:22,555
Or perhaps it just didn't get
the attraction that you hoped it would.

598
00:58:24,201 --> 00:58:25,201
Two weeks leave,

599
00:58:25,302 --> 00:58:26,288
no pay,

600
00:58:26,290 --> 00:58:27,222
that's your penance.

601
00:58:27,503 --> 00:58:28,974
You try something like this again,

602
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:29,946
you're done here.

603
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:30,789
Fine.

604
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:33,648
No, lets make it three weeks,
since you're so willing to agree.

605
00:58:33,773 --> 00:58:35,275
Perry.
No, no. Don't. Don't.

606
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:38,954
I believe you saw something, Lois.

607
00:58:39,316 --> 00:58:42,656
But not for a moment do I believe
that your leads just went cold.

608
00:58:42,734 --> 00:58:44,840
So whatever your reasons are,

609
00:58:44,912 --> 00:58:46,127
for dropping it...

610
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:48,933
I think you're doing the right thing.

611
00:58:49,493 --> 00:58:50,493
Why?

612
00:58:52,095 --> 00:58:55,088
Can you imagine how people
on this planet would react,

613
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:57,200
if...

614
00:58:58,001 --> 00:58:59,433
they knew there was someone,

615
00:58:59,807 --> 00:59:00,896
like this out there?

616
00:59:19,729 --> 00:59:20,891
Go get him.

617
00:59:27,431 --> 00:59:29,069
Well, look at you.

618
00:59:46,225 --> 00:59:47,690
A reporter came by here.

619
00:59:48,539 --> 00:59:49,395
She's a friend.

620
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:50,443
Don't worry.

621
00:59:53,822 --> 00:59:54,723
Mom.

622
00:59:55,558 --> 00:59:56,471
What'?

623
00:59:57,961 --> 00:59:59,017
I found them.

624
00:59:59,257 --> 01:00:00,023
Who?

625
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:02,605
My parents.

626
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,023
My People.

627
01:00:06,236 --> 01:00:07,216
I know,

628
01:00:07,691 --> 01:00:09,041
where I come from now.

629
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:14,646
That's wonderful.

630
01:00:16,813 --> 01:00:18,505
I'm so happy for you, Clark.

631
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:29,091
What?

632
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:30,345
It's nothing.

633
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:34,781
When you were a baby,

634
01:00:34,970 --> 01:00:36,779
I used to lay by your crib at night,

635
01:00:36,781 --> 01:00:38,352
listening to you breathe.

636
01:00:39,936 --> 01:00:41,391
It was hard for you.

637
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:43,905
You struggled.

638
01:00:44,374 --> 01:00:46,217
And I worried all the time.

639
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,217
You worried the truth would come out.

640
01:00:49,861 --> 01:00:50,610
No.

641
01:00:51,585 --> 01:00:53,010
The truth about you,

642
01:00:53,466 --> 01:00:54,417
is beautiful.

643
01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:57,886
We saw that the moment
we laid eyes on you.

644
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:02,348
We knew that one day,

645
01:01:02,973 --> 01:01:04,940
the whole world would see that.

646
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:08,468
I'm just...

647
01:01:09,655 --> 01:01:11,745
I'm worried they'll take you
away from me.

648
01:01:13,803 --> 01:01:15,418
I'm not going anywhere, Mom.

649
01:01:18,008 --> 01:01:18,996
I promise.

650
01:01:25,809 --> 01:01:27,553
General Swanwick, sir.

651
01:01:28,151 --> 01:01:29,610
What am I looking at, doc?

652
01:01:29,851 --> 01:01:31,606
Comet? Asteroid?

653
01:01:33,132 --> 01:01:35,491
Comets don't make course corrections,

654
01:01:35,891 --> 01:01:36,787
general.

655
01:01:39,863 --> 01:01:44,130
Wanted you to see this before some amateur
with a telescope creates a worldwide panic.

656
01:01:46,014 --> 01:01:49,808
The ship appears to have inserted
itself into a lunar synchronous orbit...

657
01:01:50,173 --> 01:01:51,851
though I have no idea why.

658
01:01:52,576 --> 01:01:53,621
Have you tried...

659
01:01:54,726 --> 01:01:55,944
communicating with it?

660
01:01:56,075 --> 01:01:58,980
Well, they haven't responded as of yet.

661
01:02:00,951 --> 01:02:02,119
I'm just speculating,

662
01:02:03,505 --> 01:02:07,330
but I think whoever is at the helm of that thing
is looking to make a dramatic entrance.

663
01:02:14,598 --> 01:02:16,664
Anybody know where
we keep the toner cartridge?

664
01:02:17,262 --> 01:02:18,239
What's going on?

665
01:02:18,241 --> 01:02:19,393
It's all over the news.

666
01:02:19,502 --> 01:02:20,848
You got to see this.

667
01:02:48,131 --> 01:02:49,067
Clark.

668
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:50,735
Yeah?

669
01:02:51,401 --> 01:02:52,332
Coming.

670
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:55,223
<i>This is a breaking news. An unidentified...</i>

671
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:38,507
<i>You are not alone.</i>

672
01:03:40,717 --> 01:03:42,886
<i>You are not alone.</i>

673
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:47,229
<i>You are not alone.</i>

674
01:03:52,896 --> 01:03:55,502
<i>You are not alone.</i>

675
01:04:20,924 --> 01:04:22,426
It's coming in on the RSS feeds.

676
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:24,569
You are not alone.

677
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:27,059
It's on my phone too.

678
01:04:29,399 --> 01:04:31,477
<i>My name is General Zod.</i>

679
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:36,446
<i>I come from a world far from yours.</i>

680
01:04:38,057 --> 01:04:39,293
<i>I have journeyed,</i>

681
01:04:39,586 --> 01:04:42,347
<i>across an ocean of stars to reach you.</i>

682
01:04:43,947 --> 01:04:47,906
<i>For some time, your world
has sheltered one of my citizens.</i>

683
01:04:48,585 --> 01:04:51,794
<i>I request that you return this individual,</i>

684
01:04:52,055 --> 01:04:53,519
<i>to my custody.</i>

685
01:04:54,424 --> 01:04:55,806
<i>For reasons unknown,</i>

686
01:04:56,254 --> 01:04:58,623
<i>he has chosen to keep his existence,</i>

687
01:04:58,695 --> 01:05:00,220
<i>a secret from you.</i>

688
01:05:01,756 --> 01:05:04,096
<i>He will have made efforts to blend in.</i>

689
01:05:05,368 --> 01:05:06,765
<i>He will look like you.</i>

690
01:05:07,771 --> 01:05:10,086
<i>But he is not one of you.</i>

691
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:13,617
<i>To those of you who may know,</i>

692
01:05:13,643 --> 01:05:15,078
<i>of his current location...</i>

693
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:18,176
<i>the fate of your planet...</i>

694
01:05:18,715 --> 01:05:20,663
<i>rests in your hands.</i>

695
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:25,159
<i>To Kal-El, I say this.</i>

696
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:29,991
<i>Surrender within 24 hours...</i>

697
01:05:34,114 --> 01:05:37,691
<i>or watch this world suffer
the consequences.</i>

698
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:54,610
<i>We hardly know anything
about him, isn't that right?</i>

699
01:05:55,008 --> 01:05:57,123
<i>If he truly means us no harm,</i>

700
01:05:57,159 --> 01:05:58,939
<i>then he'll turn himself in to his people</i>

701
01:05:59,111 --> 01:06:00,244
and face the consequences.

702
01:06:00,318 --> 01:06:03,064
<i>And if he won't do that,
then maybe we should.</i>

703
01:06:03,827 --> 01:06:06,115
<i>The Daily Planet's, Lois Lane
knows who this guy is.</i>

704
01:06:06,419 --> 01:06:08,430
<i>And I think she's the one
we should be questioning.</i>

705
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:10,889
<i>Hold on. You're saying Lois Lane...</i>

706
01:06:10,911 --> 01:06:11,587
Hello?

707
01:06:11,654 --> 01:06:12,942
Are you watching this crap?

708
01:06:13,357 --> 01:06:14,439
Been running all morning.

709
01:06:14,882 --> 01:06:17,287
For once I agree with Woodburn.
Have you seen him?

710
01:06:17,289 --> 01:06:18,451
<i>Do you know where he is?</i>
No.

711
01:06:18,777 --> 01:06:20,318
Even if I did, I would not say.

712
01:06:20,417 --> 01:06:22,139
The entire world,

713
01:06:22,339 --> 01:06:23,996
is being threatened here.

714
01:06:24,613 --> 01:06:27,976
<i>This is not time for you to fall
back on journalistic integrity.</i>

715
01:06:28,846 --> 01:06:30,561
<i>This is serious, Lois.</i>

716
01:06:30,843 --> 01:06:31,944
<i>The FBI is here.</i>

717
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,926
<i>They're throwing around
words like treason.</i>

718
01:06:33,946 --> 01:06:34,900
I got to go...

719
01:06:51,522 --> 01:06:52,865
FBI. Hands up.

720
01:06:52,896 --> 01:06:54,416
Drop the bag. Now.

721
01:07:01,863 --> 01:07:04,776
<i>Regarding the visitors themselves
we know very little.</i>

722
01:07:05,416 --> 01:07:07,515
<i>According to government official's
time spoken to.</i>

723
01:07:07,581 --> 01:07:09,861
<i>The visitors do not represent a threat</i>

724
01:07:09,884 --> 01:07:12,101
<i>despite the ominous tone
of their message.</i>

725
01:07:12,422 --> 01:07:14,623
<i>Then of course there is the question
on everyone's mind.</i>

726
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:18,668
<i>Who is this Kal-El person?
Does he actually exist?</i>

727
01:07:18,893 --> 01:07:21,567
<i>How could he have remained
hidden from us for so long?</i>

728
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:27,022
Come on, Kent.

729
01:07:33,975 --> 01:07:35,185
Come on. Fight back.

730
01:07:36,043 --> 01:07:37,270
Get up, Kent.

731
01:07:40,352 --> 01:07:41,491
So is that it?

732
01:07:42,572 --> 01:07:44,021
Is that all you've got?

733
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:47,061
Come on, Kent.

734
01:07:48,356 --> 01:07:49,331
Come on!

735
01:08:18,553 --> 01:08:19,691
Did they hurt you?

736
01:08:20,955 --> 01:08:22,221
You know they can't.

737
01:08:22,724 --> 01:08:23,800
That's not what I meant.

738
01:08:23,802 --> 01:08:25,324
I meant, are you alright?

739
01:08:26,995 --> 01:08:28,387
I wanted to hit that kid.

740
01:08:28,389 --> 01:08:29,830
I really wanted to hit him so bad.

741
01:08:29,832 --> 01:08:31,142
I know you did. I mean

742
01:08:31,866 --> 01:08:33,994
part of me even wanted you to,
but then what?

743
01:08:35,269 --> 01:08:36,761
Make you feel any better?

744
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:42,538
You just have to decide what kind of
man you want to grow up to be, Clark.

745
01:08:42,540 --> 01:08:43,408
Because...

746
01:08:44,278 --> 01:08:46,997
whoever that man is,
good character or bad, he's...

747
01:08:49,417 --> 01:08:50,906
He's gonna change the world.

748
01:08:56,891 --> 01:08:57,980
What's on your mind?

749
01:09:03,898 --> 01:09:05,172
I don't know where to start.

750
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:06,910
Wherever you want.

751
01:09:09,570 --> 01:09:11,166
That ship that appeared last night.

752
01:09:13,007 --> 01:09:14,274
I'm the one they're looking for.

753
01:09:19,313 --> 01:09:20,427
Do you know...

754
01:09:21,616 --> 01:09:22,754
why they want you?

755
01:09:22,984 --> 01:09:23,748
No.

756
01:09:24,143 --> 01:09:25,424
But this General Zod,

757
01:09:26,058 --> 01:09:29,160
even if I surrender, there is no
guarantee he'll keep his word, but...

758
01:09:30,287 --> 01:09:31,458
if there is a chance,

759
01:09:31,937 --> 01:09:33,958
I can save Earth by turning myself in,

760
01:09:35,696 --> 01:09:36,834
should not I take it?

761
01:09:38,332 --> 01:09:39,969
What does your gut tell you?

762
01:09:40,935 --> 01:09:42,240
Zod can't be trusted.

763
01:09:45,273 --> 01:09:46,317
The problem is...

764
01:09:47,952 --> 01:09:50,028
I'm not sure the people of Earth
can be either.

765
01:09:58,486 --> 01:10:00,796
Sometimes you have to take
a leap of faith first.

766
01:10:02,857 --> 01:10:04,375
The trust part comes later.

767
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:30,133
Alright.

768
01:10:30,721 --> 01:10:32,107
You've got our attention.

769
01:10:32,253 --> 01:10:33,254
What is it you want?

770
01:10:33,521 --> 01:10:35,254
I would like to speak to Lois Lane.

771
01:10:35,556 --> 01:10:37,196
What makes you think she's here?

772
01:10:37,758 --> 01:10:39,270
Don't play games with me, general.

773
01:10:40,061 --> 01:10:41,364
I'll surrender,

774
01:10:41,775 --> 01:10:43,888
but only if you guarantee Lois's freedom.

775
01:10:54,175 --> 01:10:55,839
Why are you surrendering to Zod?

776
01:10:57,345 --> 01:10:58,843
I'm surrendering to mankind.

777
01:10:59,391 --> 01:11:00,699
There's a difference.

778
01:11:02,083 --> 01:11:03,582
You let them handcuff you?

779
01:11:04,752 --> 01:11:06,683
Wouldn't be much of a surrender
if I resisted.

780
01:11:08,689 --> 01:11:10,456
And if it makes them feel more secure,

781
01:11:10,458 --> 01:11:11,327
then...

782
01:11:11,792 --> 01:11:13,157
then all the better for it.

783
01:11:18,010 --> 01:11:19,560
What's the S stand for?

784
01:11:22,870 --> 01:11:24,015
It's not an S.

785
01:11:25,907 --> 01:11:27,489
On my world it means hope.

786
01:11:29,443 --> 01:11:32,322
Well, here, it's an S.

787
01:11:34,982 --> 01:11:36,142
How about...

788
01:11:40,989 --> 01:11:41,990
Super

789
01:11:42,013 --> 01:11:42,875
<i>Sir?</i>

790
01:11:43,220 --> 01:11:46,235
Hi, my name is Dr. E
<i>Emil Hamilton.</i>

791
01:11:46,794 --> 01:11:47,605
<i>I know,</i>

792
01:11:47,607 --> 01:11:49,976
<i>I can see your ID tag
in your breast pocket.</i>

793
01:11:50,340 --> 01:11:52,877
Along with a half-eaten roll of
Wint-O-Green Life Savers.

794
01:11:53,434 --> 01:11:55,850
<i>I can also see the soldiers
in the next room</i>

795
01:11:56,003 --> 01:11:58,126
<i>preparing that tranquilizing agent
of yours.</i>

796
01:11:58,572 --> 01:11:59,636
You won't need it.

797
01:11:59,874 --> 01:12:03,512
Sir, you can't expect us
to not take precautions.

798
01:12:03,577 --> 01:12:06,236
You could be carrying
some kind of alien pathogen.

799
01:12:06,294 --> 01:12:07,754
<i>I've been here for 33 years, doctor.</i>

800
01:12:07,949 --> 01:12:09,470
<i>Haven't infected anyone yet.</i>

801
01:12:09,515 --> 01:12:10,731
That you know of.

802
01:12:11,285 --> 01:12:13,382
We have legitimate security concerns.

803
01:12:13,743 --> 01:12:16,223
Now you revealed your identity
to Miss Lane over there.

804
01:12:16,490 --> 01:12:18,097
<i>Why won't you do the same with us?</i>

805
01:12:19,690 --> 01:12:22,361
Let's put our cards on the table here,
general.

806
01:12:23,115 --> 01:12:25,135
<i>You scared of me because
you can't control me.</i>

807
01:12:25,766 --> 01:12:26,585
<i>You don't,</i>

808
01:12:27,016 --> 01:12:28,077
<i>and you never will.</i>

809
01:12:29,136 --> 01:12:31,116
<i>But that doesn't mean I'm your enemy.</i>

810
01:12:31,339 --> 01:12:32,442
Then who is?

811
01:12:33,107 --> 01:12:34,027
Zod?

812
01:12:35,142 --> 01:12:36,552
<i>That's what I'm worried about.</i>

813
01:12:37,144 --> 01:12:38,469
Be that as it may...

814
01:12:39,113 --> 01:12:41,547
I've been given orders
to hand you over to him.

815
01:12:43,117 --> 01:12:44,485
Do what you have to do, general.

816
01:12:49,790 --> 01:12:50,723
Thank you.

817
01:12:51,692 --> 01:12:52,670
For what?

818
01:12:53,828 --> 01:12:55,065
For believing in me.

819
01:12:58,466 --> 01:13:00,260
Didn't make much difference in the end.

820
01:13:01,335 --> 01:13:02,512
It did to me.

821
01:13:23,491 --> 01:13:24,594
They're coming.

822
01:13:25,726 --> 01:13:26,932
You should leave now.

823
01:13:29,797 --> 01:13:31,535
Go, Lois.

824
01:14:42,903 --> 01:14:43,826
Kal-El.

825
01:14:44,305 --> 01:14:46,298
I'm sub-commander Faora-Ul.

826
01:14:47,508 --> 01:14:49,190
On behalf of General Zod,

827
01:14:49,645 --> 01:14:51,382
I extend you his greetings.

828
01:14:56,217 --> 01:14:57,896
Are you the ranking officer here?

829
01:14:58,520 --> 01:14:59,324
I am.

830
01:14:59,554 --> 01:15:00,931
General Zod would like...

831
01:15:01,371 --> 01:15:03,446
this woman to accompany me.

832
01:15:04,959 --> 01:15:07,156
You asked for the alien.

833
01:15:07,428 --> 01:15:09,706
You didn't say anything
about one of our own.

834
01:15:09,919 --> 01:15:11,592
Shall I tell the general,

835
01:15:12,150 --> 01:15:14,039
you're unwilling to comply?

836
01:15:14,101 --> 01:15:15,772
I don't care what you tell him.

837
01:15:18,887 --> 01:15:20,086
It's alright.

838
01:15:21,475 --> 01:15:22,311
I'll go.

839
01:16:05,419 --> 01:16:09,052
The atmospheric composition on our ship
is not compatible with humans.

840
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:12,626
You will need to wear a breather
beyond this point.

841
01:16:38,252 --> 01:16:39,358
Kal-El.

842
01:16:40,921 --> 01:16:42,338
You have no idea,

843
01:16:42,340 --> 01:16:44,460
how long we've been searching for you.

844
01:16:45,354 --> 01:16:46,555
I take it you're Zod?

845
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:47,776
General Zod.

846
01:16:47,862 --> 01:16:49,799
Our commander.
It's alright, Faora.

847
01:16:49,964 --> 01:16:52,638
We can forgive Kal
any lapses in decorum.

848
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:54,811
He's a stranger to our ways.

849
01:16:55,069 --> 01:16:57,348
This should be cause for celebration,

850
01:16:58,267 --> 01:16:59,409
not conflict.

851
01:17:00,029 --> 01:17:01,437
Not conflict.

852
01:17:04,245 --> 01:17:05,083
I...

853
01:17:05,546 --> 01:17:06,752
feel strange.

854
01:17:09,483 --> 01:17:10,358
Weak.

855
01:17:13,287 --> 01:17:14,247
What's happening to him?

856
01:17:14,288 --> 01:17:16,474
He's rejecting our ship's atmospherics.

857
01:17:16,824 --> 01:17:17,627
Clark.

858
01:17:17,792 --> 01:17:20,266
You've spent a lifetime adapting
to Earth's ecology

859
01:17:20,328 --> 01:17:21,919
but never adapted to ours.

860
01:17:22,129 --> 01:17:23,164
Help him.

861
01:17:23,166 --> 01:17:26,054
I can't. Whatever's happening
to him has to run its course.

862
01:17:26,368 --> 01:17:27,202
Clark.

863
01:17:28,602 --> 01:17:29,583
Help him.

864
01:17:31,762 --> 01:17:32,722
Help him.

865
01:17:44,485 --> 01:17:45,610
Hello, Kal.

866
01:17:47,773 --> 01:17:49,543
Or do you prefer Clark?

867
01:17:50,491 --> 01:17:51,868
That's the name they gave you.

868
01:17:51,972 --> 01:17:52,752
Isn't it?

869
01:17:54,788 --> 01:17:56,833
I was Krypton's military leader

870
01:17:57,046 --> 01:17:59,210
your father our foremost scientist.

871
01:17:59,333 --> 01:18:00,978
The only thing we agreed on

872
01:18:01,001 --> 01:18:02,741
was that Krypton was dying.

873
01:18:03,203 --> 01:18:04,589
In return for my efforts

874
01:18:04,697 --> 01:18:06,741
to protect our civilization

875
01:18:06,807 --> 01:18:08,439
and save our planet

876
01:18:09,143 --> 01:18:10,961
I and my fellow officers,

877
01:18:11,204 --> 01:18:13,166
were sentenced to the Phantom Zone.

878
01:18:16,116 --> 01:18:19,244
<i>And then the destruction of our world</i>

879
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:20,881
<i>freed us.</i>

880
01:18:26,293 --> 01:18:27,733
<i>We were adrift,</i>

881
01:18:28,675 --> 01:18:31,870
<i>destined to float amongst
the ruins of our planet</i>

882
01:18:32,112 --> 01:18:33,841
<i>until we starved.</i>

883
01:18:35,066 --> 01:18:36,706
<i>How did you find your way to Earth?</i>

884
01:18:37,338 --> 01:18:41,198
<i>We managed to retrofit
the phantom projector into a hyperdrive.</i>

885
01:18:41,842 --> 01:18:45,340
<i>Your father made a similar modification
to the craft that brought you here.</i>

886
01:18:47,047 --> 01:18:49,783
<i>And so the instrument of our damnation</i>

887
01:18:52,186 --> 01:18:53,557
<i>became our salvation.</i>

888
01:18:58,926 --> 01:19:01,586
<i>We sought out the old colonial outposts</i>

889
01:19:01,782 --> 01:19:03,467
<i>looking for signs of life.</i>

890
01:19:06,367 --> 01:19:08,622
<i>But all we found was death.</i>

891
01:19:10,170 --> 01:19:12,541
<i>Cut off from Krypton, these outposts</i>

892
01:19:12,543 --> 01:19:14,500
<i>withered and died long ago.</i>

893
01:19:15,709 --> 01:19:17,580
<i>We salvaged what we could</i>

894
01:19:17,911 --> 01:19:19,510
<i>armor, weapons,</i>

895
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:21,518
<i>even a world engine.</i>

896
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:26,027
<i>For 33 years we prepared</i>

897
01:19:26,997 --> 01:19:29,773
<i>until finally we detected
a distress beacon</i>

898
01:19:29,923 --> 01:19:31,368
<i>which you triggered</i>

899
01:19:31,572 --> 01:19:33,804
<i>when you accessed
the ancient scout ship.</i>

900
01:19:35,596 --> 01:19:37,644
You led us here, Kal.

901
01:19:39,466 --> 01:19:41,452
And now it's within your power

902
01:19:41,593 --> 01:19:44,314
to save what remains of your race.

903
01:19:49,243 --> 01:19:50,483
On Krypton,

904
01:19:50,595 --> 01:19:53,127
the genetic template
for every being yet to be born

905
01:19:53,129 --> 01:19:55,766
is encoded in the registry of citizens.

906
01:19:56,817 --> 01:19:59,156
Your father, stole the registry's Codex

907
01:19:59,219 --> 01:20:01,535
and stored it in the capsule
that brought you here.

908
01:20:02,756 --> 01:20:03,898
For what purpose?

909
01:20:04,658 --> 01:20:06,815
So that Krypton can live again

910
01:20:08,162 --> 01:20:09,159
on Earth.

911
01:20:29,650 --> 01:20:31,539
Where is the Codex, Kal?

912
01:20:33,420 --> 01:20:34,966
If Krypton lives again

913
01:20:36,423 --> 01:20:37,750
what happens to Earth?

914
01:20:38,826 --> 01:20:41,452
The foundation has to be
built on something.

915
01:20:42,596 --> 01:20:44,862
Even your father recognized that.

916
01:20:51,839 --> 01:20:53,735
No, Zod.

917
01:20:55,609 --> 01:20:57,115
I can't be a part of this.

918
01:20:57,344 --> 01:20:59,465
Then what can you be a part of?

919
01:20:59,646 --> 01:21:00,430
No!

920
01:21:02,247 --> 01:21:03,013
Zod!

921
01:21:04,151 --> 01:21:04,972
No!

922
01:21:06,019 --> 01:21:07,427
No!

923
01:21:13,894 --> 01:21:16,629
Your father acquitted
himself with honor, Kal.

924
01:21:19,967 --> 01:21:21,825
You killed him?

925
01:21:22,302 --> 01:21:23,311
I did.

926
01:21:24,238 --> 01:21:27,007
And not a day goes by
where it doesn't haunt me.

927
01:21:29,009 --> 01:21:30,834
But if I had to do it again, I would.

928
01:21:31,578 --> 01:21:34,255
I have a duty to my people,

929
01:21:35,315 --> 01:21:37,176
and I will not allow anyone,

930
01:21:37,335 --> 01:21:39,211
to prevent me from carrying it out.

931
01:21:55,769 --> 01:21:57,241
What's the sit-rep, major?

932
01:21:58,038 --> 01:22:00,525
DSP pinged two bogeys
launching from the alien ship.

933
01:22:00,674 --> 01:22:02,002
Put it up.
Yes, sir.

934
01:22:03,210 --> 01:22:04,169
There it is.

935
01:22:04,545 --> 01:22:05,756
Re-task lkon-4

936
01:22:05,758 --> 01:22:07,195
and get me a closer look.
Yes, sir.

937
01:22:08,348 --> 01:22:10,688
Command,
the word of the day is trident.

938
01:22:10,918 --> 01:22:13,023
We have two alien craft
on aggressive approach.

939
01:22:13,053 --> 01:22:14,708
Ikon-4 coming online.

940
01:22:15,122 --> 01:22:15,930
Air speed?

941
01:22:16,189 --> 01:22:18,169
380 knots, entering Kansas airspace.

942
01:22:18,258 --> 01:22:20,060
Their not responding to our hails.

943
01:22:20,293 --> 01:22:22,152
You're wasting your efforts.

944
01:22:23,330 --> 01:22:26,067
The strength you derived
from exposure to the Earth's sun

945
01:22:26,069 --> 01:22:27,985
has been neutralized aboard our ship.

946
01:22:28,569 --> 01:22:29,306
Here

947
01:22:29,859 --> 01:22:31,231
in this environment

948
01:22:32,306 --> 01:22:33,679
you are as weak as a human.

949
01:23:32,332 --> 01:23:33,521
Where did you come from?

950
01:23:34,701 --> 01:23:36,045
The command key, Miss Lane.

951
01:23:36,284 --> 01:23:38,815
Thanks to you, I'm uploading
to the ship's mainframe.

952
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:41,018
Who are you?

953
01:23:41,975 --> 01:23:43,283
I am Kal's father.

954
01:23:44,945 --> 01:23:46,085
Can you help us?

955
01:23:47,648 --> 01:23:49,029
I designed this ship.

956
01:23:49,716 --> 01:23:52,101
I can modify its atmospheric
composition

957
01:23:52,152 --> 01:23:53,754
to human compatibility.

958
01:23:54,045 --> 01:23:54,996
We can stop them.

959
01:23:55,222 --> 01:23:57,328
We can send them back
to the Phantom Zone.

960
01:23:58,659 --> 01:23:59,296
How?

961
01:23:59,726 --> 01:24:00,854
I can teach you.

962
01:24:01,328 --> 01:24:02,901
And in turn, you can teach Kal.

963
01:24:03,363 --> 01:24:04,845
Will you help me?

964
01:24:19,112 --> 01:24:20,412
The ship's crew are alerted.

965
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:21,515
We need to move quickly.

966
01:24:21,748 --> 01:24:22,898
Retrieve the command key.

967
01:24:31,058 --> 01:24:32,481
Did you do that?
Yes.

968
01:24:32,483 --> 01:24:33,665
Pick up her sidearm.

969
01:24:43,503 --> 01:24:44,880
What's happening?

970
01:25:05,859 --> 01:25:06,608
To your right.

971
01:25:06,610 --> 01:25:07,247
Fire.

972
01:25:09,062 --> 01:25:10,102
Behind you.

973
01:25:23,210 --> 01:25:25,174
Secure yourself inside the open pod.

974
01:25:26,279 --> 01:25:27,822
Safe travels, Miss Lane.

975
01:25:28,282 --> 01:25:30,402
It's high unlikely
we'll see each other again.

976
01:25:31,952 --> 01:25:34,797
Remember, the phantom drives
are essential in stopping them.

977
01:25:36,022 --> 01:25:37,462
Move your head to the left.

978
01:26:04,751 --> 01:26:06,931
Is it true what Zod said
about the Codex?

979
01:26:07,788 --> 01:26:08,961
Strike that panel.

980
01:26:13,126 --> 01:26:15,659
We wanted you to learn
what it meant to be human first

981
01:26:16,997 --> 01:26:19,232
so that one day,
when the time was right,

982
01:26:19,890 --> 01:26:22,205
you could be the bridge
between two peoples.

983
01:26:25,372 --> 01:26:26,290
Look.

984
01:26:29,309 --> 01:26:30,279
Lois.

985
01:26:31,144 --> 01:26:32,363
You can save her, Kal.

986
01:26:35,315 --> 01:26:36,884
You can save all of them.

987
01:27:56,096 --> 01:27:57,222
You'll be safe here.

988
01:27:59,849 --> 01:28:00,997
Are you alright?

989
01:28:01,170 --> 01:28:01,867
Yeah.

990
01:28:05,772 --> 01:28:06,909
I'm sorry.

991
01:28:08,339 --> 01:28:09,941
I didn't wanna tell them
anything about you,

992
01:28:09,943 --> 01:28:10,836
but they did something to me.

993
01:28:10,838 --> 01:28:12,953
They looked inside my mind.
It's ok, Lois.

994
01:28:13,613 --> 01:28:14,998
They did the same thing to me.

995
01:28:28,461 --> 01:28:29,274
Clark!

996
01:28:38,905 --> 01:28:40,600
The craft he arrived in

997
01:28:41,107 --> 01:28:42,279
where is it?

998
01:28:44,177 --> 01:28:45,349
Go to hell.

999
01:28:56,756 --> 01:28:57,629
There.

1000
01:29:20,647 --> 01:29:22,042
The Codex is not here.

1001
01:29:29,522 --> 01:29:30,688
Where has he hidden it?

1002
01:29:30,824 --> 01:29:31,661
I don't know.

1003
01:29:31,823 --> 01:29:33,427
Where is the Codex?!

1004
01:29:48,508 --> 01:29:50,754
You think you can threaten my mother?

1005
01:30:32,552 --> 01:30:33,700
What have you done to me?

1006
01:30:34,254 --> 01:30:35,745
My parents taught me,

1007
01:30:36,006 --> 01:30:37,808
to hone my senses, Zod.

1008
01:30:40,093 --> 01:30:41,035
Focus

1009
01:30:42,262 --> 01:30:43,969
on just what I wanted to see.

1010
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:45,265
Without your helmet

1011
01:30:45,437 --> 01:30:47,007
you're getting everything.

1012
01:30:48,368 --> 01:30:49,465
And it hurts

1013
01:30:50,291 --> 01:30:51,171
doesn't it?

1014
01:31:36,583 --> 01:31:37,857
Get away from the window.

1015
01:31:40,820 --> 01:31:42,829
Get inside. It's not safe.

1016
01:31:47,561 --> 01:31:50,440
<i>All players, this is Guardian.
I am airborne mission commander.</i>

1017
01:31:50,797 --> 01:31:53,334
I have previously encountered
and observed

1018
01:31:53,366 --> 01:31:55,705
the beings we're about to engage
and close proximity.

1019
01:31:55,768 --> 01:31:58,176
<i>They are extremely dangerous
and we have been authorized</i>

1020
01:31:58,205 --> 01:31:59,526
<i>to use deadly force.</i>

1021
01:32:02,272 --> 01:32:04,375
<i>Roger, Guardian,
we are inbound to target.</i>

1022
01:32:09,816 --> 01:32:11,177
<i>Cleared hot. Weapons free.</i>

1023
01:32:11,284 --> 01:32:12,888
<i>Copy, 11. Weapons free.</i>

1024
01:32:15,888 --> 01:32:16,987
<i>Thunder 11</i>

01:32:16,989 --> 01:32:18,024
<i>tally three targets.</i>

1026
01:32:35,341 --> 01:32:36,260
<i>Thunder 11</i>

1027
01:32:36,432 --> 01:32:38,722
good hit.
Request immediate re-attack.

1028
01:32:38,945 --> 01:32:40,746
<i>Roger, Guardian.
We'll make a second gun run</i>

1029
01:32:40,748 --> 01:32:42,845
<i>on a heading of 212 degrees.</i>

1030
01:32:50,523 --> 01:32:51,663
<i>Thunder 11, eject!</i>

1031
01:32:51,724 --> 01:32:53,401
<i>Eject!</i>

1032
01:32:53,426 --> 01:32:54,903
<i>Thunder 11, eject!</i>

1033
01:33:05,505 --> 01:33:07,075
<i>I have a bogey incoming!</i>

1034
01:33:07,607 --> 01:33:08,481
Oh, shit.

1035
01:33:27,327 --> 01:33:28,985
You are weak, son of El.

1036
01:33:29,588 --> 01:33:30,726
Unsure of yourself.

1037
01:33:36,102 --> 01:33:37,064
The fact,

1038
01:33:37,251 --> 01:33:39,176
that you possess a sense of morality,

1039
01:33:39,273 --> 01:33:40,630
and we do not,

1040
01:33:41,307 --> 01:33:43,317
gives us an evolutionary advantage.

1041
01:33:47,380 --> 01:33:49,439
And if history has proven anything

1042
01:33:59,759 --> 01:34:02,598
it is that evolution always wins.

1043
01:34:24,651 --> 01:34:25,520
<i>CCT,</i>

1044
01:34:25,522 --> 01:34:27,112
<i>we're approaching LZ Jayhawk.</i>

1045
01:34:27,114 --> 01:34:28,163
<i>Get down in five.</i>

1046
01:34:28,488 --> 01:34:29,904
Let's go. Go to the LZ.

1047
01:34:30,924 --> 01:34:32,404
Roger, sarge. Let's go!

1048
01:35:10,101 --> 01:35:11,388
<i>All rangers, I need you</i>

1049
01:35:11,393 --> 01:35:12,801
to engage the targets.

1050
01:35:13,132 --> 01:35:14,402
Guardian, this is Badger 01.

1051
01:35:14,467 --> 01:35:15,741
What about the guy in blue?

1052
01:35:16,002 --> 01:35:17,706
<i>I said engage all targets.</i>

1053
01:35:29,749 --> 01:35:30,789
<i>Contact. Contact.</i>

1054
01:35:40,860 --> 01:35:41,702
You ok?

1055
01:35:47,433 --> 01:35:49,173
We're auto-rotating, going in hard.

1056
01:35:50,269 --> 01:35:51,441
<i>Brace for impact.</i>

1057
01:35:52,266 --> 01:35:53,204
<i>Brace for impact.</i>

1058
01:35:53,206 --> 01:35:54,170
<i>We're going in hard!</i>

1059
01:35:59,479 --> 01:36:01,723
<i>Fallen angel. Fallen angel.
Guardian is down.</i>

1060
01:36:01,725 --> 01:36:03,785
<i>I repeat, Guardian is down.</i>

1061
01:36:25,605 --> 01:36:26,959
<i>Guardian, do you read?</i>

1062
01:36:26,973 --> 01:36:28,551
<i>Thunder 12, calling Guardian.</i>

1063
01:36:28,553 --> 01:36:29,811
<i>Guardian, do you read?</i>

1064
01:36:29,813 --> 01:36:31,133
Thunder 12, this is Guardian.

1065
01:36:31,189 --> 01:36:32,738
I was put down everything you've got.

1066
01:36:32,754 --> 01:36:33,914
<i>They north of my position.</i>

1067
01:36:33,916 --> 01:36:36,089
<i>This will be danger-close.</i>
Copy, danger-close.

1068
01:36:36,749 --> 01:36:37,688
<i>Good luck, sir.</i>

1069
01:37:17,857 --> 01:37:20,474
A good death is its own reward.

1070
01:37:34,307 --> 01:37:35,684
You will not win.

1071
01:37:37,109 --> 01:37:38,772
For every human you save

1072
01:37:38,774 --> 01:37:40,521
we will kill a million more.

1073
01:38:32,865 --> 01:38:35,385
<i>Do we have an all dear?
Do we have an all clear?</i>

1074
01:38:36,269 --> 01:38:38,545
<i>Alpha team, sit-rep.
Alpha team.</i>

1075
01:38:38,571 --> 01:38:39,838
<i>Do you copy? Alpha team.</i>

1076
01:39:29,889 --> 01:39:31,493
This man is not our enemy.

1077
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:35,590
Thank you, colonel.

1078
01:39:54,046 --> 01:39:54,983
Mom?

1079
01:39:56,082 --> 01:39:57,295
I'm alright.

1080
01:40:09,795 --> 01:40:11,159
Nice suit, son.

1081
01:40:12,832 --> 01:40:13,874
I'm so sorry.

1082
01:40:15,167 --> 01:40:16,957
It's only stuff, Clark.

1083
01:40:18,825 --> 01:40:20,472
It can always be replaced.

1084
01:40:23,509 --> 01:40:24,581
But you can't be.

1085
01:40:26,112 --> 01:40:26,804
Mom,

1086
01:40:27,371 --> 01:40:30,603
Zod said this Codex he's looking
for can actually bring my people back.

1087
01:40:31,384 --> 01:40:32,933
Isn't that a good thing?

1088
01:40:37,289 --> 01:40:39,546
I don't think they're interested
in sharing this world.

1089
01:40:40,393 --> 01:40:41,300
Clark.

1090
01:40:42,361 --> 01:40:43,123
Clark.

1091
01:40:45,131 --> 01:40:46,498
I know how to stop them.

1092
01:40:49,068 --> 01:40:50,513
What happened down there?

1093
01:40:50,736 --> 01:40:53,437
He exposed a temporary weakness.

1094
01:40:54,473 --> 01:40:56,316
It is of little consequence

1095
01:40:57,677 --> 01:41:00,163
because I have located the Codex.

1096
01:41:01,380 --> 01:41:03,238
It was never in the capsule.

1097
01:41:04,250 --> 01:41:05,923
<i>Jor-el took the Codex.</i>

1098
01:41:06,185 --> 01:41:08,065
<i>The DNA of a billion people,</i>

1099
01:41:08,288 --> 01:41:11,499
<i>then he bonded it within his
son's individual cells.</i>

1100
01:41:11,982 --> 01:41:13,586
<i>All of Krypton's heirs</i>

1101
01:41:13,926 --> 01:41:17,190
<i>living hidden in one refugee's body.</i>

1102
01:41:21,634 --> 01:41:23,715
Does Kal-El need to be alive

1103
01:41:24,009 --> 01:41:26,743
for us to extract the Codex
from his cells?

1104
01:41:28,129 --> 01:41:29,036
No.

1105
01:41:35,281 --> 01:41:37,158
Release the world engine.

1106
01:42:09,782 --> 01:42:10,726
What just happened?

1107
01:42:10,883 --> 01:42:12,055
The ship just split in two.

1108
01:42:12,292 --> 01:42:13,576
Track one is heading east,

1109
01:42:13,578 --> 01:42:15,599
track two is point
to the southern hemisphere.

1110
01:42:15,621 --> 01:42:17,254
How fast is that bogey moving?

1111
01:42:17,490 --> 01:42:19,735
Approaching Mach 24 and accelerating.

1112
01:42:19,959 --> 01:42:22,590
It looks like gonna impact somewhere
in the south of Indian Ocean.

1113
01:42:41,647 --> 01:42:43,395
The rest of the ship is descending.

1114
01:42:43,983 --> 01:42:45,304
Put it on the board now.

1115
01:42:45,351 --> 01:42:46,069
Yes, sir.

1116
01:42:46,957 --> 01:42:48,127
Oh, my God.

1117
01:43:29,128 --> 01:43:31,135
Bring the phantom drive online.

1118
01:43:53,619 --> 01:43:55,662
We are now slave to the world engine.

1119
01:43:57,089 --> 01:43:58,015
Initiate.

1120
01:44:31,858 --> 01:44:33,253
What have they hit us with?

1121
01:44:34,461 --> 01:44:36,679
Looks like some kind of gravity weapon.

1122
01:44:37,375 --> 01:44:39,170
It's working in tandem with their ship.

1123
01:44:40,199 --> 01:44:42,971
Somehow they're increasing
the Earth's mass

1124
01:44:43,135 --> 01:44:45,440
clouding the atmosphere
with particulates.

1125
01:44:47,373 --> 01:44:48,501
Oh, my God.

1126
01:44:50,309 --> 01:44:51,567
They're terraforming.

1127
01:44:52,077 --> 01:44:53,085
What's that?

1128
01:44:53,774 --> 01:44:57,322
Planetary engineering modifying
the Earth's atmosphere and topography.

1129
01:44:58,150 --> 01:44:59,690
Turning Earth into Krypton.

1130
01:45:00,486 --> 01:45:01,856
But what happens to us?

1131
01:45:01,858 --> 01:45:03,505
Based on these readings,

1132
01:45:03,889 --> 01:45:05,381
there won't be an us.

1133
01:45:06,037 --> 01:45:07,224
General Swanwick, sir.

1134
01:45:07,293 --> 01:45:08,670
I'm on with the control tower.

1135
01:45:08,728 --> 01:45:11,169
Colonel Hardy's on his way
and he's got Superman in tow.

1136
01:45:11,897 --> 01:45:12,836
Superman?

1137
01:45:13,499 --> 01:45:14,771
The alien, sir.

1138
01:45:14,934 --> 01:45:16,708
That's what they're calling him.
Superman.

1139
01:45:22,808 --> 01:45:24,262
We have a plan, general.

1140
01:45:24,576 --> 01:45:25,922
Is that what I think it is?

1141
01:45:26,912 --> 01:45:28,492
It's the ship he arrived in.

1142
01:45:30,349 --> 01:45:32,808
This ship is powered by something
called a phantom drive.

1143
01:45:33,252 --> 01:45:34,459
It bends space.

1144
01:45:34,954 --> 01:45:36,871
Zod's ship uses the same technology,

1145
01:45:36,884 --> 01:45:39,325
and if we can make the two drives
collide with one another.

1146
01:45:39,419 --> 01:45:41,093
A singularity can be created.

1147
01:45:41,095 --> 01:45:42,443
Like a black hole.
Yes.

1148
01:45:42,672 --> 01:45:44,268
So if we open up this doorway

1149
01:45:44,596 --> 01:45:46,522
then theoretically
they should be pulled back in.

1150
01:45:46,765 --> 01:45:49,168
So you want us to bomb them with that?

1151
01:45:49,201 --> 01:45:51,221
General, that craft maxes out

1152
01:45:51,437 --> 01:45:54,375
17,000 pounds,
we can drop it from a C-17.

1153
01:45:55,040 --> 01:45:56,178
It's a viable plan.

1154
01:45:56,442 --> 01:45:58,665
If I don't stop that machine
over the Indian Ocean

1155
01:45:59,004 --> 01:46:00,518
the gravity field will continue

1156
01:46:00,779 --> 01:46:01,740
to expand.

1157
01:46:07,886 --> 01:46:10,396
If that thing is making Earth
more like Krypton

1158
01:46:11,223 --> 01:46:12,966
won't you be weaker around it?

1159
01:46:14,360 --> 01:46:15,346
Maybe.

1160
01:46:16,528 --> 01:46:18,471
But I'm not to let that
stop me from trying.

1161
01:46:19,965 --> 01:46:21,418
You might want to step back a little bit.

1162
01:46:24,236 --> 01:46:25,336
Maybe a little bit more.

1163
01:46:57,929 --> 01:46:58,732
Faora.

1164
01:46:59,438 --> 01:47:00,542
Take command.

1165
01:47:00,773 --> 01:47:01,316
Yes, sir.

1166
01:47:01,318 --> 01:47:03,378
I need to secure the genesis chamber

1167
01:47:04,343 --> 01:47:06,511
and pay my respects to an old friend.

while there is still time.

1176
01:48:23,188 --> 01:48:25,137
Haven't given up lecturing me, have you,

1177
01:48:25,428 --> 01:48:26,500
even in death?

1178
01:48:26,859 --> 01:48:28,946
I will not let you use the Codex like this.

1179
01:48:29,128 --> 01:48:30,835
You don't have the power to stop me.

1180

The command key I have entered

Oh, my God.

Perry!

Go! There! Go!

1199
01:50:56,141 --> 01:50:57,643
Our people can co-exist.

1200
01:50:58,277 --> 01:51:02,282
So we can suffer through years of pain
trying to adapt like your son has?

1201
01:51:02,315 --> 01:51:04,924
You're talking about genocide.
Yes.

1202
01:51:05,017 --> 01:51:07,623
And I'm arguing its merits with a ghost.

1203
01:51:08,987 --> 01:51:10,583
We're both ghosts, Zod.

1204
01:51:10,923 --> 01:51:11,997
Can't you see that?

1205
01:51:12,923 --> 01:51:14,594
The Krypton you're clinging onto is gone.

1206
01:51:14,664 --> 01:51:17,564
Ship, have you managed to quarantine
this invasive intelligence?

1207
01:51:17,629 --> 01:51:18,705
You'll fail.
<i>I have.</i>

1208
01:51:18,764 --> 01:51:20,175
Then prepare to terminate it.

1209
01:51:20,432 --> 01:51:21,607
I'm tired of this debate.

1210
01:51:21,767 --> 01:51:23,260
Silencing me won't change anything.

1211
01:51:26,138 --> 01:51:27,208
My son,

1212
01:51:28,373 --> 01:51:29,916
is twice the man you were.

1213
01:51:32,211 --> 01:51:33,679
And he will finish what we started.

1214
01:51:35,213 --> 01:51:36,453
I can promise you that.

1215
01:51:41,653 --> 01:51:42,597
Tell me...

1216
01:51:43,288 --> 01:51:44,982
you have Jor-El's memories,

1217
01:51:45,076 --> 01:51:46,365
his conscience.

1218
01:51:47,559 --> 01:51:49,567
Can you experience his pain?

1219
01:51:51,397 --> 01:51:55,041
I will harvest the Codex
from your son's corpse

1220
01:51:56,034 --> 01:51:58,344
and I will rebuild Krypton

1221
01:51:58,570 --> 01:52:00,276
atop his bones.

1222
01:52:58,764 --> 01:52:59,469
Jenny.

1223
01:52:59,481 --> 01:53:00,639
Jenny. Jenny?

1224
01:53:00,773 --> 01:53:02,463
Jenny where are you? I'm here!

1225
01:53:02,734 --> 01:53:03,934
I'm here. Here.

Hold on, hold on.

1227
01:53:05,771 --> 01:53:06,749
I'm stuck.

1228
01:53:06,972 --> 01:53:08,645
I can't get free. I'm stuck.
Ok.

1229
01:53:08,658 --> 01:53:10,276
We'll get you out of there, alright?

1230
01:53:10,278 --> 01:53:11,340
Just sit tight.

1231
01:53:11,624 --> 01:53:12,516
No, no, no, don't leave me!

1232
01:53:12,518 --> 01:53:13,364
Please, don't leave me.

1233
01:53:13,366 --> 01:53:14,446
We're not gonna leave you.

1234
01:53:14,479 --> 01:53:16,151
Ok.
Lombard!

1235
01:53:16,214 --> 01:53:18,134
Get your ass over here and help me.

1236
01:53:18,136 --> 01:53:19,082
Damn it.

1237
01:53:21,253 --> 01:53:23,029
We just got to move this.
Here.

1238
01:53:23,455 --> 01:53:24,391
Slide that in.

1239
01:53:24,703 --> 01:53:25,693
You push, I'll pull, ok?

1240
01:53:25,757 --> 01:53:26,497
Go.

1241
01:53:31,296 --> 01:53:32,604
Oh, my God.

1242
01:53:32,764 --> 01:53:34,590
It's getting closer! Come on, push!

1243
01:53:36,234 --> 01:53:37,417
Northcom, this is Guardian.

1244
01:53:37,419 --> 01:53:38,842
Are we cleared to make the drop?

1245
01:53:38,970 --> 01:53:39,971
Negative, Guardian.

1246
01:54:04,696 --> 01:54:05,694
Come on!

1247
01:54:05,858 --> 01:54:06,672
Push!

1248
01:54:59,150 --> 01:55:00,109
He did it.

1249
01:55:02,887 --> 01:55:04,118
<i>Northcom, this is Guardian.</i>

1250
01:55:04,120 --> 01:55:06,361
We're passing through phase line red.
<i>We're good to go.</i>

1251
01:55:06,526 --> 01:55:07,712
Godspeed, Guardian.

1252
01:55:07,759 --> 01:55:08,733
Arm the package.

1253
01:55:09,177 --> 01:55:10,300
You are cleared hot.

1254
01:55:10,529 --> 01:55:12,135
We're lining up for the final run.

1255
01:55:13,398 --> 01:55:14,970
It's up to you and Hamilton now.

1256
01:55:55,048 --> 01:55:56,134
You got to be kidding me.

1257
01:55:56,575 --> 01:55:58,086
Loadmaster, is the package on

1258
01:55:58,088 --> 01:55:59,289
and we're ready to drop?

1259
01:55:59,336 --> 01:56:00,535
Negative, Guardian.

1260
01:56:00,667 --> 01:56:03,065
There's something wrong.
It's not supposed to do this.

1261
01:56:03,073 --> 01:56:04,381
What's it supposed to do?

1262
01:56:04,383 --> 01:56:06,307
It's supposed to go in all the way.

1263
01:56:06,433 --> 01:56:07,746
<i>Let me take a look.</i>

1264
01:56:08,086 --> 01:56:09,295
Co-pilot's aircraft.

1265
01:56:10,388 --> 01:56:11,460
Co-pilot's aircraft.

1266
01:56:18,630 --> 01:56:21,261
We are lined up for the drop.
What's the hold up?

1267
01:56:21,266 --> 01:56:22,824
Out of slide setback.

1268
01:56:38,316 --> 01:56:39,551
Target that aircraft.

1269
01:56:43,688 --> 01:56:44,799
<i>Target locked.</i>

1270
01:56:55,033 --> 01:56:55,856
Stop!

1271
01:56:56,034 --> 01:56:58,041
If you destroy this ship

1272
01:56:58,370 --> 01:57:00,426
you destroy Krypton!

1273
01:57:03,842 --> 01:57:05,637
Krypton had its chance.

1274
01:57:59,998 --> 01:58:01,075
Miss Lane!

1275
01:58:01,192 --> 01:58:02,808
It's not safe for you over there!

1276
01:58:03,054 --> 01:58:04,159
Miss Lane!

1277
01:58:33,732 --> 01:58:34,960
Move now! Go!

1278
01:58:56,321 --> 01:58:57,322
A good death

1279
01:58:57,589 --> 01:58:59,159
is its own reward.

1280
02:00:01,519 --> 02:00:02,653
Are they gone?

1281
02:00:04,011 --> 02:00:05,281
I think so.

1282
02:00:07,525 --> 02:00:08,688
He saved us.

1283
02:00:34,352 --> 02:00:37,076
You know, they say it's all downhill
after the first kiss.

1284
02:00:41,025 --> 02:00:43,477
I'm pretty sure that only counts
when you're kissing a human.

1285
02:01:13,424 --> 02:01:14,473
Look at this.

1286
02:01:17,195 --> 02:01:19,306
We could have built a new Krypton

1287
02:01:19,308 --> 02:01:20,868
in this squalor.

1288
02:01:21,366 --> 02:01:24,030
But you chose the humans over us.

1289
02:01:25,904 --> 02:01:27,120
I exist,

1290
02:01:27,705 --> 02:01:29,718
only to protect Krypton.

1291
02:01:31,876 --> 02:01:33,619
That is the sole purpose,

1292
02:01:34,079 --> 02:01:35,882
for which I was born.

1293
02:01:37,115 --> 02:01:39,254
And every action I take,

1294
02:01:39,484 --> 02:01:41,176
no matter how violent,

1295
02:01:41,753 --> 02:01:43,126
or how cruel

1296
02:01:44,656 --> 02:01:46,171
is for the greater good,

1297
02:01:47,292 --> 02:01:48,711
of my people.

1298
02:01:53,564 --> 02:01:54,566
And now.

1299
02:01:55,233 --> 02:01:56,862
I have no people.

1300
02:02:00,939 --> 02:02:02,212
My soul,

1301
02:02:04,609 --> 02:02:08,147
that is what you have taken,

1302
02:02:08,413 --> 02:02:09,501
from me.

1303
02:02:16,821 --> 02:02:19,324
I'm going to make them suffer, Kal.

1304
02:02:19,657 --> 02:02:21,524
These humans you've adopted,

1305
02:02:21,526 --> 02:02:23,401
I will take them all from you,

1306
02:02:23,403 --> 02:02:24,638
one by one.

1307
02:02:24,640 --> 02:02:25,911
You're a monster, Zod

1308
02:02:28,933 --> 02:02:30,239
and I'm gonna stop you.

1309
02:04:11,736 --> 02:04:14,046
There's only one way this ends, Kal.

1310
02:04:14,272 --> 02:04:16,015
Either you die

1311
02:04:16,074 --> 02:04:17,148
or I do.

1312
02:04:48,206 --> 02:04:50,745
I was bred to be a warrior, Kal.

1313
02:04:51,809 --> 02:04:53,447
Trained my entire life

1314
02:04:53,678 --> 02:04:55,521
to master my senses.

1315
02:04:56,013 --> 02:04:59,620
Where did you train?
On a farm?

1316
02:07:08,515 --> 02:07:09,860
If you love,

1317
02:07:09,948 --> 02:07:12,090
these people so much,

1318
02:07:13,317 --> 02:07:15,593
you can mourn for them.

1319
02:07:20,057 --> 02:07:21,127
Don't do this!

1320
02:07:24,328 --> 02:07:25,436
Stop!

1321
02:07:31,502 --> 02:07:33,436
Stop!

1322
02:07:34,939 --> 02:07:35,750
Never.

1323
02:09:10,568 --> 02:09:11,945
Are you effing stupid?

1324
02:09:12,269 --> 02:09:13,894
It's one of your surveillance drones.

1325
02:09:14,238 --> 02:09:16,560
That's a $12,000,000 piece of hardware.

1326
02:09:16,907 --> 02:09:17,942
It was.

1327
02:09:18,743 --> 02:09:20,849
I know you're trying to find out
where I hang my cape.

1328
02:09:21,879 --> 02:09:22,758
You won't.

1329
02:09:22,881 --> 02:09:24,589
Then I'll ask the obvious question.

1330
02:09:25,559 --> 02:09:28,553
How do we know you won't one day
act against America's interests?

1331
02:09:29,053 --> 02:09:30,746
I grew up in Kansas, general.

1332
02:09:31,355 --> 02:09:32,927
I'm about as American as it gets.

1333
02:09:33,791 --> 02:09:34,516
Look.

1334
02:09:34,807 --> 02:09:35,844
I'm here to help

1335
02:09:36,627 --> 02:09:38,189
but it has to be on my own terms.

1336
02:09:39,296 --> 02:09:41,139
And you have to convince
Washington of that.

1337
02:09:41,397 --> 02:09:42,950
Even if I were willing to try,

1338
02:09:44,000 --> 02:09:45,404
what makes you think they'd listen?

1339
02:09:46,270 --> 02:09:47,424
I don't know, general.

1340
02:09:49,273 --> 02:09:50,670
Guess I'll just have to trust you.

1341
02:10:00,878 --> 02:10:02,351
What are you smiling about, captain?

1342
02:10:02,753 --> 02:10:03,682
Nothing, sir.

1343
02:10:07,258 --> 02:10:08,839
I just think he's kind of hot.

1344
02:10:11,195 --> 02:10:12,550
Get in the car, captain.

1345
02:10:12,552 --> 02:10:13,291
Yes, sir.

1346
02:10:23,374 --> 02:10:26,312
He always believed
you were meant for greater things.

1347
02:10:26,791 --> 02:10:28,446
And that when the day came,

1348
02:10:28,679 --> 02:10:30,942
your shoulders would be able
to bear the weight.

1349
02:10:31,749 --> 02:10:32,548
Yeah,

1350
02:10:32,812 --> 02:10:35,155
I just wish he could have been
here to see it finally happen.

1351
02:10:36,020 --> 02:10:37,634
He saw it, Clark, believe me.

1352
02:11:25,503 --> 02:11:28,347
What are you going to do
when you're not saving the world?

1353
02:11:28,572 --> 02:11:30,173
Have you given any thought to that?

1354
02:11:30,255 --> 02:11:31,474
I have, actually.

1355
02:11:33,911 --> 02:11:35,091
I got to find a job

1356
02:11:35,400 --> 02:11:37,917
where I can keep my ear to the ground.

1357
02:11:43,153 --> 02:11:44,624
<i>Where people won't look twice</i>

1358
02:11:45,590 --> 02:11:47,239
<i>when I want to go
somewhere dangerous,</i>

1359
02:11:48,281 --> 02:11:49,968
<i>and start asking questions.</i>

1360
02:12:03,117 --> 02:12:04,359
Come on, Lois.

1361
02:12:04,626 --> 02:12:06,147
When are you gonna throw me a bone?

1362
02:12:07,678 --> 02:12:09,455
Courtside seats to the game tonight.

1363
02:12:09,678 --> 02:12:11,407
What do you say?
I say...

1364
02:12:11,928 --> 02:12:14,212
you should go back
to trolling the intern pool.

1365
02:12:14,385 --> 02:12:16,185
You'll probably have more luck.

1366
02:12:16,514 --> 02:12:17,189
Sorry.

1367
02:12:19,557 --> 02:12:20,228
Courtside?

1368
02:12:20,457 --> 02:12:21,856
Don't.
No.

1369
02:12:22,726 --> 02:12:24,372
Lombard, Lane,

1370
02:12:24,509 --> 02:12:25,720
I want you to meet our new stringer.

1371
02:12:25,722 --> 02:12:26,832
I want you to show him the ropes.

1372
02:12:26,834 --> 02:12:28,324
This is Clark Kent.

1373
02:12:28,833 --> 02:12:29,653
Good luck, kid.

1374
02:12:31,769 --> 02:12:33,153
Hey. Steve.

1375
02:12:33,270 --> 02:12:34,540
Nice to meet you too.

1376
02:12:34,772 --> 02:12:35,451
Hi.

1377
02:12:36,540 --> 02:12:37,657
Lois Lane.

1378
02:12:38,709 --> 02:12:40,021
Welcome to the Planet.

1379
02:12:43,981 --> 02:12:45,423
Glad to be here, Lois.

1380
02:12:49,926 --> 02:12:53,106
