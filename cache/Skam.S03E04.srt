1
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:06,500
You just betrayed us.
What's up with that?

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,680
Hey. You forgot this Friday.

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:10,940
Forgot where?

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,720
In the cafeteria.

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:18,800
Who's that dude?

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,440
Do you know me and Sonja have
been dating since she was 15 or something?

7
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,220
He only works. 

8
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,380
Suddenly it seems like money matters most. 

9
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:56,740
<i>[Hey thanks for yesterday, what's the plan today?</i>
Suddenly it seems like money matters most. 

10
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:56,800
Suddenly it seems like money matters most. 

11
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,160
He just...

12
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:05,780
He becomes completely different when he's around his father.

13
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:14,700
And his stockbroker colleagues.

14
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:25,720
He looks up to his father so much. 
He lights up when he walks into the room.

15
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:32,060
I get it, because...

16
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,140
He never got that validation before.

17
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,620
But...

18
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,920
When he finally gets that validation, 
he becomes...

19
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,120
He becomes a kid.

20
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:52,940
But I can't live like that.

21
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,120
No.

22
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,060
Alone in London.

23
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,520
Because I went there to be together with him.

24
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,940
And now we're never together.

25
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:10,680
Yeah.

26
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,600
Yeah, yeah. I get it.

27
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,340
To be completely honest, 
it hasn't been so easy here at home either.

28
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,580
I don't know, it's been a bit like… 

29
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,860
There's been a lot of chaos. 

30
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:31,740
One week I had to wipe myself with Linn's pads. 
That's really...

31
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:38,180
And Isak, he's a really good guy, but he's like… 

32
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,160
He's so lazy.

33
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,620
Eskild?

34
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,620
I'm sitting right here.

35
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,040
Yeah.

36
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,880
You have to endure hearing that I'm happy to see Noora again.
You don't have to be so jealous.

37
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,860
I love you too.

38
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,080
Jealous?! I'm not jealous.

39
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:05,840
But we have to find a solution
because Noora's going to live here now

40
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,660
we'll be with 4 in an apartment for 3.

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,120
Are you serious?

42
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:18,260
Noora just came home after being dumped by the man of her dreams.

43
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,640
The only thing you're thinking about is the sleeping arrangements.

44
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,600
Can't you sleep on the floor?

45
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,740
I haven't been dumped. 
-No, you weren't dumped but...

46
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,460
It was me who left him there.

47
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,580
We didn't break up.

48
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,020
We have...

49
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,160
taken a break.

50
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:51,360
And if he really loves me,
he'll come after me.

51
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,000
I think that...

52
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,080
I don't know, but...

53
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,480
People leave their wives and children
 to be together with the one they love.

54
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,980
And if he really loves you,
he'll choose you.

55
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,520
I think it'll work out.

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,080
At least it's really nice to have you home again. 

57
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,660
Are you happy to be back home?

58
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,960
Does it taste good?

59
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,820
Thanks.

60
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,560
You're welcome.

61
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,120
It was Linn who made it.

62
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,720
I don't believe it.

63
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,540
That's why it's not good.

64
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,420
Hey.

65
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,380
Hi!

66
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,600
Are you going to the Halloween thing?

67
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:41,020
Eh, no. Or maybe.

68
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,020
I don't know. Are you?

69
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,260
Join me?

70
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,960
Okay!
-Okay?

71
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,600
Yeah, hm.
-Great, then we'll do a pre-drink together?

72
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,600
Yeah.

73
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,300
Hey.
-Hi.

74
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,960
Did you do anything fun this weekend?

75
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,020
Eh, no.

76
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,920
I tried to call you on Friday.

77
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,900
Yeah I saw.

78
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,900
But so damn much happened this weekend.

79
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,200
Noora came home! 
Did you hear about that?

80
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,220
Yes.

81
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,220
I heard you had a pre-drink.

82
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:39,040
Yeah, yeah I did. No, I didn't really have it, but…

83
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:48,520
Vilde pretty much forced me to have it. 
She talked to Eskild.

84
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,100
In the end I didn't have a choice.

85
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:57,020
It was more like she was hosting it at my place. 
It was really boring.

86
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,660
It's not like you were missing out on anything.

87
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,620
Magnus' birthday is on Saturday.

88
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,200
No?
-Yeah.

89
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,100
So Mahdi and me were thinking
 of doing something cool for him.

90
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,360
Yeah, I'm in.
-Yeah?

91
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,960
We can make sure he'll have sex for the first time.

92
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,680
On his birthday, yeah.
That'll be awesome.

93
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,480
We need to call those dance chicks.

94
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,540
Yes!
-He likes them.

95
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,520
Or Vilde!

96
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,140
Yes! Oh my god.

97
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,300
So he can live out his SM dream.

98
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,340
Yeah, dominatrix. Dominatrix.

99
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,520
He isn't 100%. He's sick.

100
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:48,020
... the donor's genes are thus spread to the 
next generation when the receiver splits.

101
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,760
Transferring genetics can be done in three different ways:

102
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:59,420
Through conjugation, transformation, and transduction. 

103
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,840
Do you agree?

104
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,260
Can you focus?

105
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,840
Sana. I have a question.

106
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,520
No offense, but why are you actually religious?

107
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,720
It's 2016 and the world is progressing.

108
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:31,100
You are a smart girl and you study exact sciences.
Don't you get that it's nonsense?

109
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,540
Is something in my religion bothering you?

110
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:42,660
Nothing specific, just you believing 
there is only a right and a wrong.

111
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:49,820
And that there's a god who decides 
that and who says homosexuality isn't right. 

112
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,980
Or to eat hotdogs or whatever…

113
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,460
What is it you believe in Isak?

114
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:03,560
Me? I believe in science.
The theory of evolution. Nothing else.

115
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:05,900
Okay.

116
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,240
So let's look at the theory of evolution. 

117
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,660
How do you explain homosexuality within natural selection?

118
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,500
Hm?

119
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,400
Evolution wise homosexuality is a genetic dead end.

120
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,200
Gay people don't progress the world. 

121
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,860
So according to the theory of evolution, 
they should have already been extinct millions of years ago. 

122
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:34,000
Unless homosexuality is not genetic, but rather a disease.

123
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,760
Or a choice people make.

124
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,860
What do you think about that?

125
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,320
I don't fucking know. I don't go around
thinking about homosexuality all the time.

126
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,080
No.

127
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,200
So since you don't have the answer to everything

128
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:55,140
can't we just agree that there's a lot
 between heaven and earth none of us know about?

129
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:02,260
Instead of sitting here criticizing my religion,
 just respect that we have chosen different beliefs.

130
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,840
Okay, whatever.
-Hey!

131
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,340
I talked so Sonja and she was wondering 
if we could have the pre-drink at your place?

132
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:09,880
Huh?

133
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,120
Sonja. Even's girlfriend.

134
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,380
Yeah?

135
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:20,020
She said you and Even planned a 
pre-drink before the Halloween party.

136
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,400
With us.

137
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,620
Yeah, hm-hm.
-Yeah! Cool.

138
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:31,800
Sonja and Even will dress up as God and an angel. 

139
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,900
So I thought it'd be awesome if we matched as well.

140
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:41,280
If we dress up as a cat and a mouse, 
or Batman and Batwoman or something? 

141
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,800
If you think that's fun? 
Only if you think it's fun.

142
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,980
But I'll text you.

143
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,800
Hello?

144
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,500
What is it? Shit.

145
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,280
… sexual reproduction.

146
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,820
Or was that what you just talked about? 

147
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,660
No? Okay.

148
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:12,920
Should I read it out loud?

149
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,220
<i>(more biology talk)</i>

150
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,220
Sounds easy!

151
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:35,980
Now that I'm not going to school,
I don't really know what to do.

152
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,820
I miss having something to do.

153
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,980
What do you miss most?

154
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,560
Having something to do during the day.

155
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,840
I'm pretty bored.

156
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:51,240
I've thought about that as well.
We've gone to school for 10 years.

157
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:58,760
But just going to school.
Being in the theatre for example.

158
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:04,380
Are you with the theatre?
-Yes! I don't understand people who don't want to join.

159
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,900
It's a bit weird.
-It's really weird.

160
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,740
Were you in it?
-Yes, all three years.

161
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:12,300
All three years?
-Yeah, I'm three years older than you.

162
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,300
Are you from '97? No!

163
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,360
It's really nice.
Despite the age difference.

164
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,480
It's so nice talking to you, I didn't notice...
-Yeah, same for me!

165
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,320
Didn't think of the age difference.

166
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,240
Are you one year older than Even?

167
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,980
No, I'm from '97 too.

168
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,320
Can you please calm
down a little with the beer?

169
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,140
Can you stop watching over me?

170
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,140
I mean it, stop monitoring me.

171
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,860
Where the toilet?
-In the corridor, on your right.

172
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:19,540
I heard a lot of people are coming to the party.
-What time is it?

173
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,320
Hm?
-What time is it?

174
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,620
21:21

175
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,300
Seriously?

176
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,040
Yeah, why?

177
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,640
We're going.

178
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,180
Where?

179
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,220
Wherever.

180
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,840
I feel like swimming.
Don't you?

181
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,420
Swimming?
-Yeah!

182
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,800
Who lives here?
-My aunt.

183
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:29,280
And she's okay with us being here?
-Of course. Not a problem.

184
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,700
Where is your aunt?

185
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,560
She's on holiday.

186
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,440
Why don't you have the keys?

187
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,800
Because she's on holiday.

188
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,920
That's the answer to everything.
-Relax! Don't worry.

189
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,540
You coming?

190
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,560
Okay!

191
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,860
Why are you so skeptical?

192
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:23,100
I'm not skeptical, but it's a bit weird we're going to...
-Are you scared of swimming?

193
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,540
Scared of swimming?
-Yeah.

194
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,620
Do you have a fear of water?
-Fear of water?!

195
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,120
Fear of water, yes.

196
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,960
It isn't my aunt's house.

197
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,180
So you're just scared to fuck up your hair?

198
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,960
You think I care about my hair?
-What should I think?

199
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,380
It looks like it.
-Does it look like I care about my hair?

200
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,280
Not right now, but usually it does.

201
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:06,480
You thought I died?
-Yeah I got so scared.

202
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:13,480
You suck at holding your breath?
-I suck? Try it yourself.

203
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,300
Are you challenging me?

204
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,980
I'm the master at holding my breath.
-Show me.

205
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,060
Okay fine.

206
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,520
Wow!

207
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,900
You never cease to impress.
-I got water in my lungs.

208
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,160
Yeah right!
-I swallowed water!

209
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,160
Okay!
-I'll try again.

210
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,160
Now together.
-Together?

211
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,160
On three?
-Last one to come up wins.

212
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,560
Ready?
-We're going together on three.

213
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:49,780
No, on 1.
 3, 2, 1!

214
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,340
Yes!
-Yes what?

215
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,060
I won!

216
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,780
Yes?! No! That was cheating.
-I won! Are you kidding?

217
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,500
What?!

218
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,560
That was cheating.

219
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,560
You think there are rules here?
-Yes!

220
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,440
What did you think?

221
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,460
But that's just cheating!
You can't do that.

222
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,140
I don't accept losing like that.
-Then let's do it again.

223
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,580
MOM!

224
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,280
Fuck fuck fuck!
-Fucking hell!

225
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,720
Who the hell is she?!

226
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,340
Who lives here?

227
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,720
Someone I went to elementary school with.
