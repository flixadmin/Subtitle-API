because he's been gone for hours.

-I thought you were talking about me.
-You?

00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:11,238
Yeah. 'Cause we found Barry's double,

00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,339
How about spending
more time looking for Zoom

and less time worrying about what someone,
who is not you, is doing with their life.

No. Fells died on my Earth.

This must be his Earth-1 doppelgänger.

Well, at least now that we know his name.

387

Might be a little easier
to track him down.

Yeah, but with Barry gone,

389

how are we gonna stop him
even if we do find him?

390
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:37,736
Jay, if you could shoot yourself up

-Velocity-Six?
-I cannot take V-Six.

long enough to get that bullet
out of Wells. Saved his life.

394
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,619
Joe, don't ask me
to take Velocity-Six again.

395

Look, Jay, I'm not trying
to tell you what to do.

396
00:20:47,954 --> 00:20:49,498
But Barry is protecting your world,

you look at me.

And I'm not, I'm not worthy of those.

401
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,437
-Yes, you are.
-No. I did a terrible thing, Caitlin.

402
00:21:12,979 --> 00:21:14,648
When my world's
Particle Accelerator went off,

403
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,358
I became a speedster.

404
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,109
I became the Fastest Man Alive.

405

Only, only it wasn't enough for me.

406

I wasn't fast enough.

407
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,827
So I figured
with my scientific background,

408
00:21:26,993 --> 00:21:28,579
I could increase my powers.

409
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,122
I did.

410
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:34,585
So you've taken Velocity-Six before.

00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:35,752
Yes.

But there were some
unforeseen side effects.

you didn't want Barry to take it.

00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:35,323
He shouldn't have pal-ed
around with a breacher.

638
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,575
That's a big no-no
as far as Zoom's concerned.

639
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,452
I can't believe you two work for Zoom.

640
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:42,622
REVERB: <i>No, they work for me.</i>

641
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:45,250
I work for Zoom.

642
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,755
Who the hell are you?

643
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:54,134
(LAUGHS)

644
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,886
Well, that's funny.

645
00:34:57,052 --> 00:35:00,223
I was just going to ask you
the same thing.

646
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,437
-Doppel...
-...gänger.

647
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:11,234
What the hell is going on here?

648
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:12,527
Are you two related to each other?

649
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,487
Oh, I knew there was another "me" here!

650
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,364
And I knew you were coming, Cisco.

651
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:17,948
Even before you entered the breach

652
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,784
and set foot on this world.

653
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,248
See, we're all connected, Francisco.

654
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,167
The name is Vibe.

655
00:35:28,834 --> 00:35:29,835
Reverb.

656
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,963
Actually not the worst name
you could've come up with.

657
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,840
-But not the best.
-(CHUCKLES)

658
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,511
I've been watching you, Vibe.

659
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:42,097
And I have to say,
I am extremely disappointed.

660
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:44,267
Yeah? I know the feeling.

661
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:45,560
I'm not sure what's worse.

662
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,228
The fact that you're part of Zoom's gang

663
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:50,815
or that weird samurai situation you got
going on on the top of your head there.

664
00:35:51,982 --> 00:35:53,526
Listen to this.

665
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:58,113
What if Zoom wasn't
running the show anymore?

666
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:02,660
-What do you mean?
-You don't even know how powerful you are.

667
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:06,497
All you use your powers for
are these cheap parlor tricks,

668
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:09,875
when you, you could be a God.

669
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:13,504
We could be Gods.

670
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,679
Are you Cloud City Vadering me right now?

671
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,515
KILLER FROST: <i>Are you out of your mind?</i>

672
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,852
Let's turn them over to Zoom.

673
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:30,188
Speak to me like that again

674
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:33,316
and I will shatter your entire nervous
system without breaking a sweat.

675
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:37,069
So...

676
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:40,198
Vibe...

677
00:36:41,031 --> 00:36:43,117
Do you wanna run Central City?

678
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,035
What do you say?

679
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:49,290
I say...

680
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:51,751
Flash save us!

681
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:53,794
(GRUNTING)

682
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:55,713
(PANTS)

683
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:57,382
Hey. That didn't hurt you, did it?

684
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,217
-No. Why would it?
-I don't know.

685
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:00,426
And who the hell are you?

686
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:02,428
Look, Detective,
just get out of here, all right?

687
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:03,679
No. Not without them!

688
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:07,392
(GRUNTS)

689
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:09,269
(GROANS)

690
00:37:15,065 --> 00:37:16,066
Stay here!

691
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:20,195
Round two.

692
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:25,618
Look, Mirror Mirror, I already told you.
I'm not going to the dark side with you.

693
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,911
(YELLING)

694
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,628
You're a rotten shot.

695
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,091
I'm not.

696
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,594
Are you telling me I can do that?

697
00:37:44,094 --> 00:37:45,596
I can show you.

698
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,564
-No!
-(GRUNTS)

699
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:04,449
KILLER FROST: <i>Stop! The both of you!</i>

700
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,409
Zoom wanted him alive!

701
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:08,953
You know what Zoom will do
if you don't obey him!

702
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,621
(GRUNTS)

703
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,624
KILLER FROST: <i>No!</i>

704
00:38:15,125 --> 00:38:16,294
That.

705
00:38:19,129 --> 00:38:22,883
What did I say you should do

706
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:26,846
if you encountered a speedster?

707
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:29,765
Leave him unharmed.

708
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:35,187
Does this look unharmed to you?

709
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:37,607
(GRUNTS)

710
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:44,238
(CHOKING)

711
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:50,620
I'm happy to see

712
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:56,125
at least one of you knows their place.

713
00:39:02,548 --> 00:39:03,924
Barry!

714
00:39:04,174 --> 00:39:05,175
(PANTING)

715
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,052
No. (CRIES)

716
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:10,848
No. (PANTS)

717
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,355
(PANTS)

718
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:19,857
(PANTS)

719
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:24,737
(WINCES)

720
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:28,198
Sorry. Did I forget to say
this might sting?

721
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:32,202
(SIGHS) It's not my first road rash.
(GRUNTS) I'm a speedster, remember?

722
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:34,622
You made sure
no one will forget that tonight.

723
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:36,290
Thanks to you.

724
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,543
Velocity-Seven held up pretty well.

725
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,252
Moving on to Velocity-Eight.

726
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,754
I'm gonna figure it out. I swear.

727
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:45,883
I just need you to figure out
how to restabilize the breach.

728
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:49,219
Barry, Cisco, and Wells
still have twenty-four hours to go.

729
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,556
So we have one day,

730
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,391
or they could be stuck there forever.

731
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,192
(TAPPING)

732
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,132
Jesse. Jesse.

733
00:40:28,383 --> 00:40:29,635
Hey. I'm here with your dad.

734
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,929
We're gonna get you out of here,
all right? I promise.

735
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:39,186
It's not wise to make promises

736
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:42,773
you can't keep, Flash.

737
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:46,276
Look around.

738
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:51,949
This is the last place

739
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:55,077
you'll ever see.
