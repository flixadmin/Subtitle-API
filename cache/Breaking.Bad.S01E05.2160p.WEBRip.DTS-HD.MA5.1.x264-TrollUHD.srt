1
00:00:02,822 --> 00:00:06,326
Here's my résumé.

2
00:00:06,535 --> 00:00:09,829
I mean, technically it says
"curriculum vitae"

3
00:00:10,037 --> 00:00:14,000
which I think is more professional,
but, you know

4
00:00:14,209 --> 00:00:15,710
same thing, pretty much.

5
00:00:15,919 --> 00:00:17,712
That's... Wow, great.

6
00:00:17,921 --> 00:00:21,007
This position truly is a
no-experience-necessary kind of thing.

7
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:24,302
And it doesn't really say it here,

8
00:00:24,511 --> 00:00:28,390
but I have a solid background in sales.

9
00:00:28,598 --> 00:00:30,517
I'm pretty much a self-starter, so...

10
00:00:30,725 --> 00:00:32,894
- That's excellent, but...
- Excellent.

11
00:00:33,103 --> 00:00:34,229
I just

12
00:00:34,437 --> 00:00:37,190
I really feel I could be a major

13
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:40,527
major asset to your sales force.

14
00:00:43,196 --> 00:00:45,496
I'm thinking there's
a little misunderstanding.

15
00:00:45,615 --> 00:00:47,284
This isn't actually a sales job.

16
00:00:47,492 --> 00:00:51,204
I mean, I'd be happy to consider you
for a sales position,

17
00:00:51,413 --> 00:00:53,563
but all our agents need to be licensed

18
00:00:53,665 --> 00:00:56,165
have at least two years
on-the-job experience,

19
00:00:56,334 --> 00:00:57,934
and usually a college degree.

20
00:01:02,465 --> 00:01:04,676
What you'll be doing is more like

21
00:01:04,884 --> 00:01:06,761
advertising.

22
00:01:19,774 --> 00:01:21,234
Hey, Jesse.

23
00:01:21,443 --> 00:01:23,570
Hey, man.

24
00:01:23,778 --> 00:01:24,904
Yo, man.

25
00:01:25,112 --> 00:01:26,990
- What up?
- Badger?

26
00:01:27,198 --> 00:01:29,701
Where you been keeping yourself?

27
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:32,329
Nice duds.

28
00:01:32,537 --> 00:01:34,247
Yeah, you too.

29
00:01:34,456 --> 00:01:36,166
Thanks.

30
00:01:36,374 --> 00:01:39,169
Yo, why would you wanna do
this lame-ass job, anyway?

31
00:01:39,377 --> 00:01:41,171
I mean, no offense.

32
00:01:41,379 --> 00:01:42,839
Because I'm on probation, yo.

33
00:01:43,048 --> 00:01:46,384
I gotta prove to the man
I'm rehabilitated.

34
00:01:46,593 --> 00:01:49,679
Upstanding citizen, all that shit.

35
00:01:49,888 --> 00:01:52,599
It's really good exercise too.

36
00:01:52,807 --> 00:01:55,507
You can't just stand there,
you have to spin the arrow.

37
00:01:55,644 --> 00:01:58,938
There's all these moves
you have to learn, like "the helicopter."

38
00:02:03,109 --> 00:02:05,320
Yeah. See, yeah?

39
00:02:05,528 --> 00:02:06,863
That one's a bitch.

40
00:02:07,072 --> 00:02:08,698
I'm not very good at it yet.

41
00:02:08,907 --> 00:02:11,207
You really opened my eyes
to the possibilities.

42
00:02:11,326 --> 00:02:13,620
- Yeah.
- Hey, anyways

43
00:02:14,788 --> 00:02:16,998
- thanks for the toke.
- Any time.

44
00:02:17,207 --> 00:02:18,416
Speaking of which

45
00:02:19,542 --> 00:02:22,921
you think you could maybe
hook me up with some crystal?

46
00:02:23,672 --> 00:02:26,424
No, I've been out of the business
for a while.

47
00:02:26,633 --> 00:02:28,885
Actually, now thinking about retiring.

48
00:02:29,094 --> 00:02:31,096
- What? No.
- Yeah.

49
00:02:31,304 --> 00:02:33,723
That stuff you made is unbelievable.

50
00:02:33,932 --> 00:02:35,266
It was pretty awesome.

51
00:02:35,475 --> 00:02:36,685
Retirement?

52
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:39,145
I can't be hearing this.

53
00:02:39,354 --> 00:02:43,400
No, man, I had this partner
who was helping me cook.

54
00:02:43,608 --> 00:02:46,027
I mean, I was doing most of the work...

55
00:02:48,195 --> 00:02:50,240
but he was an asshole, so...

56
00:02:50,448 --> 00:02:53,798
Anyway, I mean, pseudo's getting
harder and harder to come by and...

57
00:02:53,952 --> 00:02:56,621
Yo, I can hook you up with some pseudo.

58
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:58,540
Major pseudo.

59
00:02:58,748 --> 00:03:01,126
I got channels, bro.

60
00:03:01,334 --> 00:03:02,794
We could partner up.

61
00:03:05,046 --> 00:03:06,131
No pressure.

62
00:03:06,339 --> 00:03:08,758
No pressure.
Just think about it, all right?

63
00:03:08,967 --> 00:03:11,511
Oh, shit. I gotta go.

64
00:03:21,104 --> 00:03:23,481
Yo, this way to savings.

65
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:25,817
Save your dollar bills, y'all.

66
00:03:31,656 --> 00:03:34,159
<i>Big savings This way and save</i>

67
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,622
Come on! Save some money.

68
00:04:04,731 --> 00:04:06,274
It's a stupid gift.

69
00:04:06,483 --> 00:04:07,984
No, it isn't. He'll love it.

70
00:04:08,193 --> 00:04:09,903
I don't know what I was thinking.

71
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:12,989
Didn't the invitation
even say "no gifts"?

72
00:04:13,198 --> 00:04:14,908
- Walt.
- What?

73
00:04:15,116 --> 00:04:16,743
We have to go.

74
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,828
I know, I'm not complaining.

75
00:04:19,037 --> 00:04:20,246
Yes, you are.

76
00:04:22,874 --> 00:04:24,834
{\an8}Look, we need this.

77
00:04:25,043 --> 00:04:28,296
{\an8}We've been through a lot
lately. Okay?

78
00:04:30,423 --> 00:04:34,594
{\an8}Jesus, guess we didn't get
the "beige" memo.

79
00:04:35,553 --> 00:04:36,846
{\an8}We're okay.

80
00:04:37,055 --> 00:04:40,350
{\an8}Yes, I look like I'm wearing
a prom dress from 1985.

81
00:04:40,558 --> 00:04:42,185
{\an8}Honey, you look fine.

82
00:04:42,393 --> 00:04:45,814
{\an8}Walt, this is the only thing
I could find that fit me.

83
00:04:47,023 --> 00:04:50,777
God, would you look at that.
The invitation said "no gifts."

84
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:53,321
{\an8}So? Come on.

85
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:56,825
{\an8}Sir, I'll take that for you.

86
00:04:58,326 --> 00:05:01,246
{\an8}- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

87
00:05:03,414 --> 00:05:04,874
Oh, look, there's Elliott.

88
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:07,752
Oh, come on, let's go say hello.

89
00:05:09,045 --> 00:05:10,630
Elliott.

90
00:05:11,548 --> 00:05:12,715
{\an8}Walt.

91
00:05:12,924 --> 00:05:15,051
{\an8}You made it.

92
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,302
Happy birthday.

93
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:18,721
- Wouldn't miss it for the world.
- Skyler.

94
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,850
Hi. Oh, that's right.

95
00:05:22,058 --> 00:05:24,408
{\an8}Great to see you.
You look beautiful, as always.

96
00:05:24,602 --> 00:05:27,772
{\an8}Well, these days a little more big
than beautiful, but...

97
00:05:27,981 --> 00:05:31,401
Of course, congratulations.
That was such great news.

98
00:05:31,609 --> 00:05:35,280
{\an8}- Thank you.
- Gretchen, look who's here.

99
00:05:38,992 --> 00:05:40,410
It's been ages.

100
00:05:40,618 --> 00:05:43,454
Oh, it's so good to see you.

101
00:05:45,123 --> 00:05:46,249
It's really good.

102
00:05:46,457 --> 00:05:48,107
Skyler, welcome. Congratulations.

103
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:50,503
Thank you.
It's really nice to be here.

104
00:05:50,712 --> 00:05:53,298
- When are you due?
- In about 10 more weeks.

105
00:05:54,966 --> 00:05:57,566
And actually, we recently found out
that it's a girl.

106
00:05:57,719 --> 00:06:00,430
{\an8}- Oh, that's so wonderful.
- Yeah.

107
00:06:00,638 --> 00:06:03,099
{\an8}Yeah, we've been thinking about it
for ourselves.

108
00:06:03,308 --> 00:06:04,601
Yeah, thinking about it.

109
00:06:07,145 --> 00:06:09,689
{\an8}Oh, hey, by the way

110
00:06:09,898 --> 00:06:12,775
{\an8}securing that patent was just amazing.

111
00:06:12,984 --> 00:06:16,905
I mean, the work
that your company is doing...

112
00:06:17,113 --> 00:06:18,781
Congratulations to both of you.

113
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:22,827
{\an8}- Hard work and a lot of luck. A lot.
- Yeah. Oh, well, now.

114
00:06:23,036 --> 00:06:24,329
{\an8}Elliott.

115
00:06:24,537 --> 00:06:25,997
Excuse us, we gotta say hi.

116
00:06:26,205 --> 00:06:28,165
{\an8}Make yourselves at home, we'll catch up.

117
00:06:28,249 --> 00:06:29,542
{\an8}Sure, sure. Okay.

118
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:31,201
- Okay.
- So glad you're here.

119
00:06:31,336 --> 00:06:32,837
- Thank you.
- Bye.

120
00:06:33,046 --> 00:06:34,714
John, Missy. How are you?

121
00:06:34,923 --> 00:06:36,507
Shall we?

122
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:40,261
Congratulations. Happy birthday.

123
00:07:54,794 --> 00:07:56,045
Walt?

124
00:07:56,254 --> 00:07:57,755
I thought that was you.

125
00:07:57,964 --> 00:07:59,132
Farley.

126
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,050
Long time no see.

127
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:03,219
- This is Walter White.
- Hello.

128
00:08:03,428 --> 00:08:05,096
Back at Caltech, he was...

129
00:08:05,304 --> 00:08:07,932
You were just a master
of crystallography.

130
00:08:08,141 --> 00:08:12,228
{\an8}I remember this one time we were
stuck on this protein problem,

131
00:08:12,437 --> 00:08:14,147
{\an8}for weeks.

132
00:08:14,355 --> 00:08:16,649
You just breezed right in,

133
00:08:16,858 --> 00:08:18,609
and you had one word for us...

134
00:08:18,818 --> 00:08:21,654
Synchrotrons.
It was synchrotrons, yeah.

135
00:08:21,863 --> 00:08:25,450
They generate pure and more complete
patterns than x-ray beams.

136
00:08:25,658 --> 00:08:28,745
Data collection
takes a fraction of the time.

137
00:08:28,953 --> 00:08:31,330
This is the White in Gray Matter.

138
00:08:32,749 --> 00:08:35,668
- Tell them, Walt.
- Okay.

139
00:08:35,877 --> 00:08:39,088
Well, back when Elliott and I
were in grad school

140
00:08:39,297 --> 00:08:40,840
we came up with the name.

141
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:44,093
Schwartz, black. Walter White.

142
00:08:44,302 --> 00:08:47,180
So together they became
Gray Matter Technologies.

143
00:08:47,388 --> 00:08:49,932
- Cute, huh?
- So you run the company with Elliott?

144
00:08:50,141 --> 00:08:52,935
No. No, that's Gretchen and Elliott.

145
00:08:53,144 --> 00:08:56,314
Yeah, yeah. You know,
I gravitated toward education.

146
00:08:57,148 --> 00:08:58,691
What university?

147
00:09:01,152 --> 00:09:04,947
Oh, wow, it's a Stratocaster.

148
00:09:05,156 --> 00:09:08,951
Not just any Strat.
That's one of Clapton's.

149
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,995
No way.

150
00:09:11,204 --> 00:09:15,625
"To Elliott, sorry about the buckle rash,
Eric Clapton."

151
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,628
Thank you. This is beautiful.

152
00:09:18,836 --> 00:09:20,630
- Why is he doing this?
- Beautiful.

153
00:09:20,838 --> 00:09:22,632
What is he, like, 8 years old?

154
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,675
Here, honey.

155
00:09:27,929 --> 00:09:29,138
Thanks.

156
00:09:29,347 --> 00:09:30,515
Oh, this is from Walt.

157
00:09:30,723 --> 00:09:32,391
- Oh, God.
- It's okay.

158
00:09:34,185 --> 00:09:35,686
Hey.

159
00:09:36,187 --> 00:09:38,439
Let's see what we got.

160
00:09:44,362 --> 00:09:46,030
Yum Good Ramen.

161
00:09:57,542 --> 00:10:02,255
This is what Walt and I lived on,

162
00:10:02,463 --> 00:10:04,841
for 10 months straight

163
00:10:05,049 --> 00:10:07,844
while we were working on our thesis.

164
00:10:08,052 --> 00:10:11,013
Sold them down at Ralstow's
in the hardware aisle.

165
00:10:11,222 --> 00:10:13,015
Right next to the... What was it?

166
00:10:13,224 --> 00:10:15,351
- Sterno. Yeah.
- The Sterno.

167
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,562
Yeah, 10 for a dollar ninety-nine.

168
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,731
To this day, I am convinced these noodles

169
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,067
were responsible for our success.

170
00:10:23,276 --> 00:10:25,403
This was our lifeblood.

171
00:10:25,611 --> 00:10:29,157
Man, where'd you find these? I thought
they'd been outlawed years ago.

172
00:10:31,284 --> 00:10:32,910
I love it.

173
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:36,581
Thank you, Walt.

174
00:10:37,248 --> 00:10:38,875
Well.

175
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:41,002
For the man who has everything.

176
00:10:42,211 --> 00:10:43,311
- No, no, no.
- It was.

177
00:10:43,462 --> 00:10:45,312
- No, you remember the fat guy.
- Yes.

178
00:10:45,506 --> 00:10:47,216
We used to call him Snot Trough.

179
00:10:47,425 --> 00:10:49,075
He had that thing under his nose.

180
00:10:49,177 --> 00:10:51,721
- What do you call that thing?
- That was Dobkins.

181
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:54,929
That was the same guy who
always smelled like chocolate milk.

182
00:10:55,016 --> 00:10:56,726
- It was.
- No, no, no.

183
00:10:56,934 --> 00:10:59,270
It wasn't Dobkins, it was...

184
00:10:59,478 --> 00:11:02,899
Anyway, I swear to Christ,
he used to iron those patches

185
00:11:03,107 --> 00:11:06,402
onto the elbows
of his Members Only jacket

186
00:11:06,611 --> 00:11:09,196
because he thought it made him
look distinguished.

187
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,449
- Didn't it? I thought it...
- No.

188
00:11:12,658 --> 00:11:14,911
Oh, God.
Well, here's to Snot Trough.

189
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:17,037
- To Snot Trough.
- Wherever you may be.

190
00:11:17,121 --> 00:11:18,789
God bless him.

191
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:25,421
Do you remember the professor who
used to hate Robert Wilhelm Bunsen?

192
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:28,633
Yes. All you had to do
was mention the Bunsen burner,

193
00:11:28,841 --> 00:11:30,843
and he was off on a rant.

194
00:11:31,052 --> 00:11:34,096
"Oh, he didn't invent it."
Do you remember the waving?

195
00:11:34,305 --> 00:11:37,099
"He just improved it," you know.

196
00:11:37,308 --> 00:11:38,935
It was easy to kill 15 minutes.

197
00:11:39,143 --> 00:11:40,645
Yeah.

198
00:11:41,854 --> 00:11:43,231
Oh, God.

199
00:11:43,439 --> 00:11:45,358
I miss this, Walt.

200
00:11:45,566 --> 00:11:48,152
Yeah. Me too.

201
00:11:48,361 --> 00:11:50,511
Listen, we ought to get together
more often.

202
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:53,155
Skyler and I would love
to have you and Gretchen

203
00:11:53,324 --> 00:11:54,951
over for dinner sometime.

204
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:56,994
Oh, sure, yeah, absolutely.

205
00:11:58,204 --> 00:12:03,000
But, you know, what I mean is that
you and I should work together again.

206
00:12:05,253 --> 00:12:08,130
- Are you gonna teach high school?
- No, no, no, seriously.

207
00:12:08,214 --> 00:12:10,508
What's stopping us?

208
00:12:13,344 --> 00:12:15,762
Wait a minute, Elliott, what are you...?

209
00:12:15,972 --> 00:12:18,641
Are you asking me to come work
for you at Gray Matter?

210
00:12:18,849 --> 00:12:20,851
Yeah, why not? You'd fit right in.

211
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:24,313
You're brilliant,
you got a ton of experience.

212
00:12:24,522 --> 00:12:26,148
Well

213
00:12:26,357 --> 00:12:28,357
I wouldn't really know where to begin.

214
00:12:28,526 --> 00:12:29,776
I mean...

215
00:12:29,986 --> 00:12:32,029
God, you have no idea.

216
00:12:32,238 --> 00:12:36,200
I spend my days just drawing out
atoms on the chalkboard,

217
00:12:36,409 --> 00:12:39,359
and trying to get these kids to learn
the periodic table.

218
00:12:39,495 --> 00:12:41,330
Look, I understand.

219
00:12:41,539 --> 00:12:45,001
You're a little rusty,
but you're not seeing the upside here.

220
00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:48,921
We could really benefit
from a new set of eyes.

221
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:51,930
You know when you've
been trying to crack some problem,

222
00:12:52,049 --> 00:12:54,199
for months on end, you get tunnel vision.

223
00:12:54,302 --> 00:12:59,223
One guy thinking outside of the box,
you may be exactly what we need.

224
00:13:14,572 --> 00:13:17,867
Well, listen, Elliott, it...

225
00:13:18,075 --> 00:13:21,412
The offer is very appealing,
it really is, I thank you.

226
00:13:22,747 --> 00:13:24,915
But there's...

227
00:13:25,124 --> 00:13:27,418
There's something you should know.

228
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:34,383
I have some personal issues.

229
00:13:34,592 --> 00:13:36,886
Look, there's nothing we can't work out.

230
00:13:37,094 --> 00:13:39,388
Well, yeah, but

231
00:13:39,597 --> 00:13:42,183
it's complicated.

232
00:13:42,933 --> 00:13:44,560
We can help you.

233
00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:47,480
We have excellent health insurance.

234
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,776
The best.

235
00:14:12,671 --> 00:14:15,174
Hey, did you try those
prosciutto-wrapped figs?

236
00:14:15,383 --> 00:14:17,301
They were, like, wow.
They were just...

237
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,929
I must have had about 30
of those suckers.

238
00:14:20,137 --> 00:14:22,287
Oh, and the seafood table,
did you see that?

239
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:25,768
They had lobster tail,
they had crab legs, like, shrimp.

240
00:14:25,976 --> 00:14:27,603
They had...

241
00:14:30,314 --> 00:14:33,651
- Walt.
- What the hell did you say to Elliott?

242
00:14:33,859 --> 00:14:35,809
- What?
- You told him about the cancer

243
00:14:35,903 --> 00:14:38,781
didn't you? Didn't you?

244
00:14:38,989 --> 00:14:41,117
I can't believe it.

245
00:14:41,325 --> 00:14:44,954
Okay, we were talking,
he asked how you were doing,

246
00:14:45,162 --> 00:14:48,562
and I am sorry, but I don't have
the best poker face these days

247
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,042
where that's concerned.

248
00:14:50,251 --> 00:14:53,921
He knew something was wrong
with you, and he pressed me.

249
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,631
He pressed you? Come on.

250
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,467
Walt, when it came right down to it

251
00:14:58,676 --> 00:15:01,136
I didn't know what to do
but tell him the truth.

252
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:05,015
The truth? Well, how about
you just said, "He's fine," huh?

253
00:15:07,268 --> 00:15:10,354
You could have said that. "He's fine."
It would have been done.

254
00:15:10,438 --> 00:15:12,238
I don't like the way you're talking.

255
00:15:12,356 --> 00:15:15,006
I don't like the way you talk
about private affairs

256
00:15:15,192 --> 00:15:19,196
to people who are not
even in our lives anymore.

257
00:15:19,405 --> 00:15:21,824
Well, what exactly did he say to you?

258
00:15:22,032 --> 00:15:23,482
- He offered me a job.
- What?

259
00:15:23,576 --> 00:15:27,079
Yes. Kind of like some fig leaf,
you know.

260
00:15:27,288 --> 00:15:29,707
Some face-saving bullshit

261
00:15:29,915 --> 00:15:33,085
that allowed me
to generously accept his charity.

262
00:15:33,294 --> 00:15:35,754
And then when I turned that down,
he flat out

263
00:15:35,963 --> 00:15:38,007
offered to pay for my treatment.

264
00:15:38,215 --> 00:15:41,385
Which is exactly what
you expected him to do, didn't you?

265
00:15:41,802 --> 00:15:42,845
- Walt.
- Didn't you?

266
00:15:43,053 --> 00:15:46,807
- No. I did not put him up...
- Please. Come on. Come on.

267
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:51,479
Okay, what did you say?

268
00:15:53,564 --> 00:15:55,316
Walt?

269
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,735
What do you think I said?

270
00:15:58,611 --> 00:16:01,071
Why? Walt.

271
00:16:49,161 --> 00:16:52,498
- Ready to go?
- I'm taking the bus.

272
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:57,002
Okay.

273
00:16:58,587 --> 00:17:00,923
Bye, honey.

274
00:17:38,752 --> 00:17:41,547
Hey, dude. Are these bullet holes?

275
00:17:43,549 --> 00:17:46,510
No, man. Those are for,
like, you know

276
00:17:46,719 --> 00:17:48,762
ventilation.

277
00:17:49,555 --> 00:17:50,889
Cool.

278
00:17:52,266 --> 00:17:55,436
Nice setup, huh?

279
00:17:55,644 --> 00:17:57,730
- Man.
- This is nothing, man.

280
00:17:57,938 --> 00:18:00,858
I used to have, like,
twice as much glassware

281
00:18:01,066 --> 00:18:07,197
until my dumb-ass ex-partner drove
us into a ditch and wrecked most of it.

282
00:18:07,406 --> 00:18:09,950
Big-ass beaker, huh?

283
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:13,579
Hey, wait, wait, no, that's...
Yeah, that's a boiling flask.

284
00:18:13,787 --> 00:18:15,873
This is a beaker.

285
00:18:16,081 --> 00:18:20,711
Here's a Griffin beaker.
Here's a volumetric beaker.

286
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:23,714
Here's an Erlenmeyer flask.

287
00:18:23,922 --> 00:18:26,216
You got...

288
00:18:26,425 --> 00:18:28,761
You really know your shit.

289
00:18:28,969 --> 00:18:30,512
It's just basic chemistry, yo.

290
00:18:32,097 --> 00:18:33,974
So

291
00:18:34,183 --> 00:18:36,185
You got something for me?

292
00:18:36,393 --> 00:18:38,103
Hells, yeah.

293
00:18:49,114 --> 00:18:50,240
Okay.

294
00:18:50,449 --> 00:18:52,576
We're in business.

295
00:18:52,785 --> 00:18:53,827
Right on, Badger.

296
00:18:54,036 --> 00:18:56,413
Dude, check this out.

297
00:18:56,997 --> 00:18:58,248
Jesus.

298
00:18:58,457 --> 00:19:01,919
- What are you bringing that for?
- Hunting.

299
00:19:02,127 --> 00:19:04,463
We might see javelinas.

300
00:19:34,326 --> 00:19:36,078
Are you gonna help me or what?

301
00:19:41,542 --> 00:19:43,460
Hey.

302
00:19:47,965 --> 00:19:49,216
Badger!

303
00:20:00,018 --> 00:20:02,271
Yeah, buddy. Yeah.

304
00:20:47,524 --> 00:20:49,318
Let's see the money.

305
00:20:49,735 --> 00:20:51,028
Here.

306
00:20:51,236 --> 00:20:53,363
I need five each.
Come on, two more.

307
00:20:53,572 --> 00:20:55,407
Here.

308
00:20:56,033 --> 00:20:57,534
What about him?

309
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:00,579
Are you kidding?
He looks younger than us.

310
00:21:00,788 --> 00:21:02,080
Whatever.

311
00:21:03,081 --> 00:21:04,583
What about that guy?

312
00:21:04,792 --> 00:21:06,585
No, he looks like a businessman.

313
00:21:06,794 --> 00:21:07,836
So what?

314
00:21:08,045 --> 00:21:10,631
So businessmen are always in a hurry.

315
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:14,092
They're always, like, going
to some meeting or something.

316
00:21:14,301 --> 00:21:16,303
Seriously, he's just gonna say no.

317
00:21:18,263 --> 00:21:20,140
Hey, hey, this guy.

318
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:21,391
This is our guy.

319
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,643
You're up.

320
00:21:22,851 --> 00:21:24,603
Why do I have to do it?

321
00:21:24,812 --> 00:21:26,772
Give me the crutches and I'll go do it.

322
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,442
Shit.

323
00:21:32,778 --> 00:21:34,905
Excuse me, hey

324
00:21:35,113 --> 00:21:37,363
we forgot our IDs, and we were wondering

325
00:21:37,491 --> 00:21:41,119
if you could do us a favor
and buy us a six-pack?

326
00:21:41,328 --> 00:21:43,956
You know, what you're asking is illegal.

327
00:21:45,332 --> 00:21:46,583
No, it's not.

328
00:21:46,792 --> 00:21:48,794
Yeah, it is.

329
00:21:49,002 --> 00:21:51,380
Oh, shit.

330
00:21:53,674 --> 00:21:55,968
Guess you win the jackpot.

331
00:21:57,386 --> 00:21:59,686
This is not how I wanted to spend
my night off.

332
00:22:00,347 --> 00:22:02,933
Consider this your first
and last warning.

333
00:22:03,141 --> 00:22:06,186
- Yes, sir.
- You're lucky you got a good dad, here.

334
00:22:14,236 --> 00:22:16,280
If the other guys hadn't run

335
00:22:16,488 --> 00:22:19,283
I could've talked my way out of it.

336
00:22:19,491 --> 00:22:21,618
Not cool, man. Not cool.

337
00:22:21,827 --> 00:22:25,330
What, you never tried to buy beer
when you were my age?

338
00:22:25,539 --> 00:22:28,500
I'm talking about you calling me
and not your father.

339
00:22:28,834 --> 00:22:30,878
How do you think that'd make him feel?

340
00:22:41,138 --> 00:22:43,682
I don't even know what to say to you.

341
00:22:46,184 --> 00:22:48,145
Just go.

342
00:22:48,353 --> 00:22:50,564
I'll deal with you later.

343
00:22:57,195 --> 00:22:58,530
Where's Walt?

344
00:23:00,157 --> 00:23:03,702
I haven't seen him since this morning.
Your guess is as good as mine.

345
00:23:04,077 --> 00:23:06,204
Listen, do me a favor, all right?

346
00:23:06,412 --> 00:23:08,332
Don't tell him about the kid.

347
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:11,460
He's just a teenager
trying to score some beer.

348
00:23:12,377 --> 00:23:13,921
You know

349
00:23:14,546 --> 00:23:15,923
growing pains.

350
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:20,385
I mean, he finds out his dad's sick,
he starts acting out, you know?

351
00:23:20,594 --> 00:23:23,263
First the pot, then this.

352
00:23:23,472 --> 00:23:24,932
The pot?

353
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:31,229
- You told me the kid was smoking.
- That's what Skyler told me.

354
00:23:31,437 --> 00:23:35,692
- I mean, you may as well have.
- I wasn't talking about Walter, Jr.

355
00:23:35,901 --> 00:23:38,737
I was talking about Walt.

356
00:23:40,446 --> 00:23:42,908
Excuse me?

357
00:23:43,116 --> 00:23:45,494
He admitted it.

358
00:23:46,495 --> 00:23:48,914
He said he liked it.

359
00:23:49,455 --> 00:23:51,249
Walt?

360
00:23:55,212 --> 00:23:57,089
Shit.

361
00:24:00,592 --> 00:24:03,053
I didn't think he had it in him.

362
00:24:03,261 --> 00:24:05,411
- It's like he's not himself lately.
- Yeah.

363
00:24:05,514 --> 00:24:06,598
I mean

364
00:24:06,807 --> 00:24:10,227
why would anyone in their right mind
choose not to do treatment?

365
00:24:10,435 --> 00:24:13,105
Especially when it's completely paid for.

366
00:24:13,438 --> 00:24:15,148
Why is he doing this?

367
00:24:16,441 --> 00:24:18,276
You know what we need to do?

368
00:24:18,484 --> 00:24:21,446
What we really need to do
is sit him down, all of us,

369
00:24:21,655 --> 00:24:23,907
and get everything out on the table.

370
00:24:24,116 --> 00:24:26,410
Talk it all through.

371
00:24:26,618 --> 00:24:29,621
- You mean an intervention?
- No, no.

372
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:33,250
Just a family meeting.

373
00:24:33,458 --> 00:24:36,586
Where everyone can voice their concerns,

374
00:24:36,795 --> 00:24:39,131
and be heard.

375
00:24:47,139 --> 00:24:49,182
You are a genius, bro.

376
00:24:49,391 --> 00:24:51,351
This cankenstein is unreal.

377
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,760
When we get back,
I'm gonna burn that suit

378
00:24:53,895 --> 00:24:57,149
because we're gonna make some mad dough.

379
00:24:58,066 --> 00:25:00,068
It's not right.

380
00:25:00,277 --> 00:25:01,927
What do you mean, it's not right?

381
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:07,117
It's cloudy.
It's not supposed to be cloudy.

382
00:25:07,325 --> 00:25:09,995
Okay, that last time, it was glass.

383
00:25:10,203 --> 00:25:15,167
So what? Cloudy, not cloudy?
It looks good enough to me.

384
00:25:17,044 --> 00:25:19,004
Good enough.

385
00:25:21,006 --> 00:25:24,217
Wait, wait.
Yo, what are you doing?

386
00:25:29,598 --> 00:25:32,398
Are you out of your mind?
I totally would've smoked that.

387
00:25:32,517 --> 00:25:34,644
It's not for you, it's for our customers.

388
00:25:34,853 --> 00:25:36,853
They're gonna demand a certain standard.

389
00:25:36,938 --> 00:25:39,900
What? What...? What are you...?

390
00:25:40,233 --> 00:25:42,568
- What?
- We'll just do it again.

391
00:25:43,361 --> 00:25:44,696
Until we get it right.

392
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,596
Walt.

393
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:15,018
Please have a seat and join us.

394
00:27:06,069 --> 00:27:09,030
- We can do better.
- Don't you fucking think about it.

395
00:27:09,239 --> 00:27:12,117
- Hey.
- Come on.

396
00:27:13,743 --> 00:27:15,536
Three entire pounds of pseudo wasted.

397
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,820
Do you know how long
I had to spin that sign?

398
00:27:17,956 --> 00:27:21,918
- Get off me, psycho.
- Helicopter, bitch!

399
00:27:30,802 --> 00:27:32,762
God!

400
00:27:36,892 --> 00:27:37,934
Asshole.

401
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:41,855
Open the door.

402
00:28:03,627 --> 00:28:06,588
Come back here, you bitch!

403
00:28:06,796 --> 00:28:08,298
I'm gonna mess you up!

404
00:28:10,091 --> 00:28:11,968
This isn't funny!

405
00:28:20,977 --> 00:28:24,481
I really need to understand
your thought process

406
00:28:24,689 --> 00:28:26,608
because clearly I don't.

407
00:28:26,816 --> 00:28:31,613
I feel that this decision you've made

408
00:28:31,821 --> 00:28:34,115
is not only not in your best interest

409
00:28:34,324 --> 00:28:37,827
it's not in the best interest
of our entire family.

410
00:28:38,161 --> 00:28:41,331
- Look, Skyler...
- Not yet, please. I...

411
00:28:42,207 --> 00:28:43,507
{\an8}I have the talking pillow.

412
00:28:46,544 --> 00:28:48,794
Everybody gets to speak their minds,
remember?

413
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,549
And then you'll get your chance.

414
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:55,679
Money has always been
an issue for us, I'll give you that.

415
00:28:55,887 --> 00:28:59,015
But now that Elliott is more than willing
to pitch in...

416
00:28:59,224 --> 00:29:02,477
Walt, I know, I understand
that it's hard for you to accept help.

417
00:29:02,686 --> 00:29:04,729
Maybe it's the way you were raised.

418
00:29:04,938 --> 00:29:06,815
But, honey

419
00:29:07,023 --> 00:29:10,986
it's okay to lean on people
now and again.

420
00:29:11,194 --> 00:29:13,446
You need this treatment.

421
00:29:13,655 --> 00:29:16,491
And nothing can stop you from getting it

422
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:18,410
except you.

423
00:29:26,042 --> 00:29:29,462
- Am I allowed to respond?
- In a minute.

424
00:29:29,671 --> 00:29:33,591
I think we need
to go around the circle first.

425
00:29:35,468 --> 00:29:37,721
Hank, would you like to start?

426
00:29:41,474 --> 00:29:44,853
Yeah. Okay, well...

427
00:29:45,061 --> 00:29:47,561
- What I would say is...
- Take the talking pillow.

428
00:29:54,321 --> 00:29:56,448
All right, look, buddy

429
00:29:57,198 --> 00:30:01,494
I know I don't get to
tell you this enough,

430
00:30:02,996 --> 00:30:05,290
but I care about you.

431
00:30:05,915 --> 00:30:08,084
A hell of a lot.

432
00:30:08,752 --> 00:30:10,587
And this cancer thing...

433
00:30:11,254 --> 00:30:15,216
Let's just... Let's face it, you know,
you were dealt a shit hand.

434
00:30:15,425 --> 00:30:17,260
But

435
00:30:17,469 --> 00:30:19,387
sometimes your luck can change.

436
00:30:19,596 --> 00:30:20,638
I mean...

437
00:30:20,847 --> 00:30:24,647
I mean, I can't tell you how many times
I was... I started with a shit hand,

438
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:28,438
and I ended up with a, you know,
a full house. Okay?

439
00:30:28,813 --> 00:30:30,963
I mean, the key is,
you gotta hang in there.

440
00:30:31,149 --> 00:30:35,278
Man, you gotta keep placing your bets,
keep placing your bets.

441
00:30:36,863 --> 00:30:38,448
Hank

442
00:30:38,656 --> 00:30:41,742
- what the hell are you saying?
- Please, Marie, let him talk.

443
00:30:41,826 --> 00:30:44,996
That's what we're here to do. Please.

444
00:30:45,872 --> 00:30:47,791
Go on, Hank.

445
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:52,796
All right, look at it this way, okay?

446
00:30:53,004 --> 00:30:55,965
It's the bottom of the ninth,
bases are loaded

447
00:30:56,174 --> 00:30:57,801
you're up.

448
00:30:58,343 --> 00:31:00,637
But you got a bum arm, right?

449
00:31:00,845 --> 00:31:04,099
There's no fricking way
you're gonna hit a homer, okay?

450
00:31:04,307 --> 00:31:07,936
So you can either let the pinch hitter
take the bat,

451
00:31:08,144 --> 00:31:12,148
or you can hold on to your pride
and lose the game.

452
00:31:12,482 --> 00:31:14,484
You get what I'm saying?

453
00:31:15,652 --> 00:31:17,570
No.

454
00:31:19,823 --> 00:31:22,534
You got your pride, man.
I get it, okay? I get it.

455
00:31:23,284 --> 00:31:25,534
But this Daddy Warbucks
wants to chip in, man.

456
00:31:25,662 --> 00:31:29,916
I'm with your old lady on this one.
I say take the money and run, man.

457
00:31:33,211 --> 00:31:35,296
Somebody wanna take this thing?
Here.

458
00:31:35,505 --> 00:31:36,840
Yes, Walter...

459
00:31:37,048 --> 00:31:42,804
Walter, Jr., I'm sure that you have
about a million things to say, probably.

460
00:31:43,012 --> 00:31:45,515
And now is your chance.

461
00:31:46,349 --> 00:31:50,019
Go ahead. Just let it all out.

462
00:31:52,522 --> 00:31:53,648
This is bullshit.

463
00:31:53,857 --> 00:31:55,733
- Hey, come on.
- It's all right.

464
00:31:56,067 --> 00:31:57,861
It...

465
00:32:00,697 --> 00:32:02,490
Talk.

466
00:32:02,699 --> 00:32:05,201
Tell your dad how you feel.

467
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:10,915
- I'm pissed off.
- Tell him.

468
00:32:11,624 --> 00:32:14,252
I'm pissed off.

469
00:32:14,461 --> 00:32:17,088
Because you're being...

470
00:32:17,714 --> 00:32:19,048
You're...

471
00:32:21,217 --> 00:32:22,760
You're a pussy.

472
00:32:24,721 --> 00:32:28,099
You're, like, ready to give up.

473
00:32:30,351 --> 00:32:33,855
You're... God.

474
00:32:34,063 --> 00:32:36,566
What if you gave up on me, huh?

475
00:32:42,572 --> 00:32:44,282
This here

476
00:32:44,491 --> 00:32:46,534
all the stuff I've been through,

477
00:32:46,743 --> 00:32:51,080
and you're scared
of a little chemotherapy?

478
00:33:05,595 --> 00:33:08,181
Me, personally...

479
00:33:10,183 --> 00:33:12,769
I think you should do
whatever you wanna do.

480
00:33:14,646 --> 00:33:16,189
What?

481
00:33:16,981 --> 00:33:19,400
You told us to be honest
about our feelings.

482
00:33:19,609 --> 00:33:21,859
Walt's the one with cancer,
it's his decision.

483
00:33:21,945 --> 00:33:23,905
It's not up to any of us.

484
00:33:24,113 --> 00:33:28,576
- Why in hell would you do this?
- Hey, hey.

485
00:33:28,785 --> 00:33:31,913
I wasn't planning on agreeing with Walt.

486
00:33:32,121 --> 00:33:35,221
After sitting and listening
to you all talk about his future

487
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:38,753
- like he has no say in it...
- He's not gonna have a future

488
00:33:38,962 --> 00:33:40,588
if he doesn't get treatment.

489
00:33:40,797 --> 00:33:43,800
I am a medical professional.

490
00:33:44,008 --> 00:33:47,929
I x-ray people in treatment every day.

491
00:33:48,137 --> 00:33:50,640
I see them every day.
And you know what?

492
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:54,602
Some of them are absolutely miserable.

493
00:33:54,811 --> 00:33:57,438
- Marie...
- I'm sorry, but it's true.

494
00:33:57,647 --> 00:34:02,277
And some of them don't wanna spend
their last weeks or months

495
00:34:02,485 --> 00:34:04,946
being picked at by doctors.

496
00:34:05,154 --> 00:34:07,615
But they got talked into it
by their families.

497
00:34:07,824 --> 00:34:10,034
Can I get the pillow back?
I agree with Marie.

498
00:34:10,118 --> 00:34:11,168
- Thank you.
- Hank...

499
00:34:11,369 --> 00:34:13,496
What? Maybe Walt wants to die
like a man.

500
00:34:13,705 --> 00:34:16,124
I don't want him to die at all.

501
00:34:16,332 --> 00:34:19,669
That's the whole point of this.
So either help or leave.

502
00:34:20,044 --> 00:34:22,880
Skyler, I just wanted
to do you the courtesy

503
00:34:23,089 --> 00:34:25,341
of giving you my honest opinion.

504
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:29,178
You know, Marie, this is not debate club.

505
00:34:29,387 --> 00:34:34,767
- This is my husband's life...
- I made one simple observation...

506
00:34:34,976 --> 00:34:38,479
- And it's like you... How dare you...
- Okay, so we disagree...

507
00:34:38,688 --> 00:34:40,732
Ladies! Marie!

508
00:34:43,026 --> 00:34:45,486
This is so stupid.

509
00:34:49,991 --> 00:34:52,091
All right,
I've got the talking pillow now.

510
00:34:53,494 --> 00:34:54,704
Okay?

511
00:35:05,381 --> 00:35:08,426
We all, in this room

512
00:35:08,801 --> 00:35:10,887
we love each other.

513
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,807
We want what's best for each other,
and I know that.

514
00:35:15,224 --> 00:35:17,727
I am very thankful for that.

515
00:35:19,062 --> 00:35:22,565
But what I want...

516
00:35:25,068 --> 00:35:28,404
What I want, what I need

517
00:35:29,822 --> 00:35:32,408
is a choice.

518
00:35:33,034 --> 00:35:37,080
What does that mean?

519
00:35:38,831 --> 00:35:43,878
Sometimes I feel like I never actually

520
00:35:44,087 --> 00:35:47,715
make any of my own choices

521
00:35:47,924 --> 00:35:49,759
I mean.

522
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,183
My entire life

523
00:35:58,768 --> 00:36:00,937
it just seems I never...

524
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:08,361
you know, had a real say about any of it.

525
00:36:11,322 --> 00:36:14,659
Now, this last one, cancer

526
00:36:16,452 --> 00:36:20,665
all I have left is
how I choose to approach this.

527
00:36:20,873 --> 00:36:23,876
Then make the right choice, Walt.

528
00:36:24,669 --> 00:36:27,630
You are not the only one it affects.

529
00:36:28,631 --> 00:36:30,299
What about your son?

530
00:36:31,968 --> 00:36:36,139
Don't you wanna see your daughter
grow up? I just...

531
00:36:41,144 --> 00:36:43,229
Of course I do.

532
00:36:45,106 --> 00:36:49,819
Skyler, you've read the statistics,
you...

533
00:36:54,741 --> 00:36:56,534
These doctors

534
00:36:56,743 --> 00:36:59,704
talking about "surviving"

535
00:36:59,912 --> 00:37:04,459
one year, two years,
like it's the only thing that matters.

536
00:37:04,667 --> 00:37:11,667
But what good is it to just survive
if I am too sick to work?

537
00:37:12,717 --> 00:37:15,344
To enjoy a meal?

538
00:37:17,388 --> 00:37:19,265
To make love?

539
00:37:26,189 --> 00:37:29,025
For what time I have left...

540
00:37:31,277 --> 00:37:33,529
I wanna live in my own house.

541
00:37:33,738 --> 00:37:36,532
I wanna sleep in my own bed.

542
00:37:36,741 --> 00:37:40,328
I don't wanna choke down
30 or 40 pills every single day,

543
00:37:40,536 --> 00:37:41,746
and lose my hair,

544
00:37:42,288 --> 00:37:46,709
and lie around, too tired to get up...

545
00:37:48,795 --> 00:37:52,882
and so nauseated
that I can't even move my head.

546
00:37:54,884 --> 00:37:56,719
And you.

547
00:37:57,178 --> 00:37:59,597
Cleaning up after me.

548
00:38:01,808 --> 00:38:03,893
And me? What...?

549
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,521
Some...

550
00:38:06,729 --> 00:38:11,400
Some dead man, some artificially alive...

551
00:38:11,943 --> 00:38:15,321
Just marking time.

552
00:38:16,823 --> 00:38:19,075
No. No.

553
00:38:22,578 --> 00:38:25,706
And that's how you would remember me.

554
00:38:31,712 --> 00:38:34,090
That's the worst part.

555
00:38:37,009 --> 00:38:43,099
So that is my thought process, Skyler.

556
00:38:44,642 --> 00:38:47,436
I'm sorry. I just...

557
00:38:51,524 --> 00:38:54,944
I choose not to do it.

558
00:40:49,016 --> 00:40:50,768
All right.

559
00:40:54,021 --> 00:40:56,190
"All right" what?

560
00:40:59,402 --> 00:41:01,904
I'll do the treatment.

561
00:41:32,893 --> 00:41:35,229
It's gonna be okay.

562
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:37,565
Okay.

563
00:42:03,174 --> 00:42:04,924
The lady from the billing office

564
00:42:05,051 --> 00:42:07,928
said they usually bill
the insurance company directly.

565
00:42:08,137 --> 00:42:13,350
But since our HMO's not paying for it,
we can pay up front with a credit card.

566
00:42:13,559 --> 00:42:15,436
Good.

567
00:42:15,936 --> 00:42:20,483
Oh, and then Elliott will send a check.

568
00:42:20,691 --> 00:42:23,444
I will take care of it.

569
00:42:28,449 --> 00:42:30,201
Walter White?

570
00:42:30,659 --> 00:42:32,495
Yes.

571
00:42:34,622 --> 00:42:36,499
Okay.

572
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:38,292
- All right.
- Okay.

573
00:42:38,501 --> 00:42:39,918
- See you in a minute.
- Okay.

574
00:42:40,002 --> 00:42:41,295
Okay.

575
00:44:12,386 --> 00:44:13,846
Elliott.

576
00:44:14,054 --> 00:44:16,473
<i>Walt, it's Gretchen.</i>

577
00:44:17,808 --> 00:44:19,351
Oh, hey.

578
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,187
Hey, Gretchen, how are you?

579
00:44:21,395 --> 00:44:25,232
<i>You know, it was really great seeing
you two the other day, you know.</i>

580
00:44:25,441 --> 00:44:28,068
Wow, what a party.

581
00:44:28,903 --> 00:44:32,364
Elliott told me about the cancer.

582
00:44:32,573 --> 00:44:35,910
I'm so sorry.

583
00:44:37,703 --> 00:44:38,829
<i>Well, you know</i>

584
00:44:39,413 --> 00:44:41,624
it is what it is, I guess.

585
00:44:41,832 --> 00:44:43,918
<i>I don't know what to say.</i>

586
00:44:44,126 --> 00:44:47,213
Except, I'm always here for you.

587
00:44:47,755 --> 00:44:51,258
<i>Both of us are.
We wanted you to know that.</i>

588
00:44:52,593 --> 00:44:55,221
Yeah, well, thank you.

589
00:44:56,472 --> 00:45:01,518
<i>Walt, Elliott told me that he'd offered
to pay for the treatment.</i>

590
00:45:01,726 --> 00:45:02,770
<i>You have to accept.</i>

591
00:45:02,978 --> 00:45:05,178
That money,
as far as we're both concerned

592
00:45:05,314 --> 00:45:07,566
that belongs to you.

593
00:45:07,775 --> 00:45:11,362
Even the name of our company,
it's half yours.

594
00:45:13,822 --> 00:45:15,032
<i>Walt?</i>

595
00:45:18,035 --> 00:45:21,121
Is this about you and me?

596
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:35,636
Gretchen, I really appreciate the offer.

597
00:45:35,844 --> 00:45:39,390
<i>I do. But we're fine.</i>

598
00:45:40,516 --> 00:45:43,978
As it turns out,
the insurance came through after all.

599
00:45:44,186 --> 00:45:46,105
So

600
00:45:46,313 --> 00:45:49,774
I am covered. And...

601
00:45:50,067 --> 00:45:52,820
<i>Well, and, anyway,
I really appreciate it, I really do.</i>

602
00:45:53,028 --> 00:45:54,822
<i>Thank you.</i>

603
00:45:55,656 --> 00:45:58,200
Good. That's good news.

604
00:45:59,868 --> 00:46:02,913
You know, that really was a great party.

605
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,629
- Keep in touch, okay?
- Sure. Sure, and

606
00:46:10,838 --> 00:46:13,090
thank you for calling.

607
00:47:01,846 --> 00:47:03,057
Yo!

608
00:47:11,732 --> 00:47:13,359
Wanna cook?
