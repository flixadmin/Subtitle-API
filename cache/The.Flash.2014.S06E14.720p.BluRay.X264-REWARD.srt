1
00:00:26,027 --> 00:00:28,279
Air traffic control's reporting
a helicopter in distress.

2
00:00:28,363 --> 00:00:30,883
Why is it every time I come to visit
all hell is breaking loose?

3
00:00:34,994 --> 00:00:36,764
Oh, no. It's gonna hit
the new Seaver building.

4
00:00:36,788 --> 00:00:38,206
It's okay. Barry's on it.

5
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,166
What am I on?

6
00:01:24,169 --> 00:01:26,421
Always have to make an entrance,
don't you, Kid Flash?

7
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,674
What can I say? It's great to be back.

8
00:01:59,412 --> 00:02:00,914
A lotus flower.

9
00:02:00,997 --> 00:02:02,975
Okay, that is seriously beautiful.

10
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:05,710
Yeah, I'm definitely gonna need you
to teach me how to do that.

11
00:02:05,794 --> 00:02:08,171
The lotus is one of the eight
auspicious symbols,

12
00:02:08,254 --> 00:02:10,507
meaning purity and renunciation.

13
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:14,010
A practice which I'm currently being
guided through by Bhikkhuni Amala,

14
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:16,013
the Buddhist nun
assigned to my Peace Corps camp.

15
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:19,265
Wow, "purity and renunciation."

16
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:21,810
Guess that means more wine for me.

17
00:02:23,686 --> 00:02:26,397
Just being here,
celebrating with family, new friends...

18
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:30,360
- That is all the joy I need.
- Look at you getting your Zen on.

19
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:35,406
It's working.

20
00:02:37,534 --> 00:02:38,868
Who is that?

21
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:43,039
That's my brother, Wally.
He looks so happy.

22
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:47,252
I wish I was there.

23
00:02:52,924 --> 00:02:55,009
I'm sorry.
I couldn't hold the window any longer.

24
00:02:56,261 --> 00:02:57,345
It's okay.

25
00:02:58,847 --> 00:03:02,684
It was so good to see them,
even if it was just for a second.

26
00:03:04,561 --> 00:03:06,104
You miss your family.

27
00:03:07,063 --> 00:03:09,732
Yeah, well,
I've been trapped in here for weeks...

28
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:15,113
and losing my sense of time
like I'm in some sort of dream.

29
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:22,412
All the while, my family is out there
with that... that thing that isn't me.

30
00:03:23,538 --> 00:03:27,250
I hope they don't forget about you
as quickly as my Joseph forgot about me.

31
00:03:34,716 --> 00:03:37,176
He used to come to my mirror every day

32
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,012
and try to figure out
a way to get me out.

33
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:44,934
Does he know that you're still in here?

34
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:48,770
I don't know.

35
00:03:53,276 --> 00:03:54,596
Barry calls me his lightning rod.

36
00:03:56,696 --> 00:04:00,116
He used to say that he could find me
anywhere in the universe.

37
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:03,035
Seems like there's nothing
he wouldn't do for you.

38
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:09,667
I haven't seen my husband in years.

39
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:14,756
I haven't touched him in 72 months.

40
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:18,885
312 weeks.

41
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:22,347
2,190 days.

42
00:04:22,555 --> 00:04:24,641
2,190 days.

43
00:04:25,558 --> 00:04:26,976
2,190 days.

44
00:04:27,936 --> 00:04:31,189
2,190 days.

45
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:33,399
2,190 days.

46
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:35,985
Eva, listen to me. Breathe.

47
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,033
2190...

48
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:44,702
- Hey, Iris, everything okay?
- Um, yeah.

49
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:48,039
Greetings, Earth-Prime-lings!

50
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:50,375
Babe, you're home early.

51
00:04:53,336 --> 00:04:55,964
- Well, you look...
- I know, right?

52
00:04:56,047 --> 00:04:58,675
- Wow, hey, bud.
- Hey.

53
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,261
- You're finally back.
- I am.

54
00:05:02,345 --> 00:05:04,013
Well, after a while,

55
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:07,350
all the post-Crisis anomaly hunting
starts to catch up with you.

56
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:09,394
That, and I wanted to wash

57
00:05:09,477 --> 00:05:12,105
all the Atlantean fish smell
off of these clothes.

58
00:05:12,188 --> 00:05:13,398
Mmm-mmm.

59
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:14,564
Hugs from here.

60
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:19,654
You guys shouldn't have.

61
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:24,117
- Shame.
- Well, it's good to see you, friend.

62
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:26,786
Wally West? What?

63
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,747
Where have you been? Welcome home...

64
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:36,796
"Welcome home." I see.
I'm crashing your party.

65
00:05:37,088 --> 00:05:39,400
You know we're always happy
to have you back, Crocodile Dundee.

66
00:05:39,424 --> 00:05:40,424
Come on. Let me make you a drink.

67
00:05:40,425 --> 00:05:42,225
- Oh, you know me too well.
- Mmm.

68
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:48,558
Okay, babe,
I think we should probably get you home.

69
00:05:48,725 --> 00:05:51,519
Mmm, yeah. Yeah, you're right.

70
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:54,439
It's like 4:00
in the morning in Atlantis,

71
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:56,899
so, yeah, should probably go to bed.

72
00:05:56,983 --> 00:05:59,444
Yeah, we should get home
and relieve the babysitter.

73
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:02,363
- Hon, I got to go back to the office.
- What?

74
00:06:02,613 --> 00:06:06,325
I can't get any work done
since Nash moved in across the hall.

75
00:06:06,409 --> 00:06:08,679
I can give you a ride. I'm working
the late shift at <i>The Citizen.</i>

76
00:06:08,703 --> 00:06:09,703
Perfect.

77
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,640
- Good night, guys.
- Good night.

78
00:06:11,664 --> 00:06:12,582
Bye-bye.

79
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:13,917
Uh-uh, uh-uh.

80
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,919
- We got this.
- Okay. Won't argue with that.

81
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,216
- You ready? Let's do it.
- Hmm.

82
00:06:29,766 --> 00:06:31,006
Whoa.

83
00:06:31,184 --> 00:06:32,244
What was that?

84
00:06:32,268 --> 00:06:33,352
Uh...

85
00:06:34,771 --> 00:06:37,106
Nothing. Um, it was a...

86
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:42,445
Just a hiccup. A small hiccup.

87
00:06:43,196 --> 00:06:44,112
A "hiccup."

88
00:06:44,113 --> 00:06:46,325
Is that the first one?

89
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:47,699
Uh...

90
00:06:48,076 --> 00:06:49,076
Barry.

91
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:51,871
Are you all right, man?

92
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:54,999
No. I mean,
I've had a few little things...

93
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:58,086
It's still sore.

94
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:00,264
My speed healing
was weird for a little bit.

95
00:07:00,338 --> 00:07:02,298
But, I mean, it's fine now.

96
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:06,719
It was just my body still recovering
from Crisis.

97
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:10,515
- Barry.
- Yeah?

98
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,226
I didn't just come back to see family.

99
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,649
Lately I've been sensing that there's
something wrong with the Speed Force.

100
00:07:22,819 --> 00:07:25,446
A disturbance in
the Speed Force you feel?

101
00:07:25,905 --> 00:07:27,448
That's a terrible Yoda.

102
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:31,661
Bhikkhuni Amala helped me discover a way
to communicate with the Speed Force,

103
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:34,163
to seek guidance

104
00:07:34,247 --> 00:07:38,167
by projecting my consciousness into it
while leaving my body behind.

105
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:43,422
Damn. I've never been able to do that.
Just usually comes to me.

106
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:47,093
As your mother, right? Yeah, I remember
from the lightning storm.

107
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,262
For me, it's different.

108
00:07:49,762 --> 00:07:51,889
It's more of a voice inside my head,
guiding me.

109
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:55,643
But a few months ago,
that voice just went quiet.

110
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:59,730
Now, every time I try to reach out,
silence.

111
00:08:00,356 --> 00:08:02,692
When was the last time
the Speed Force came to you?

112
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:07,655
Uh,
I mean, it's been a while.

113
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:11,659
But, um, listen.
I don't think there's

114
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:13,786
anything wrong with the Speed Force.

115
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:17,206
You know, I mean, if there was,
it would let me know, you know?

116
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:20,609
Besides, I'm sure there's
a simple explanation for all this.

117
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:22,712
Trust me.

118
00:08:29,177 --> 00:08:31,053
One oat milk Vibeaccino, extra hot,

119
00:08:31,137 --> 00:08:34,432
with two sugars and three
short sprinkles of cinnamon, to go.

120
00:08:35,892 --> 00:08:39,770
I said three sugars
and two sprinkles of cinnamon.

121
00:08:55,912 --> 00:08:56,912
Alexi?

122
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,352
I thought you'd go down easy

123
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,921
in that fancy helicopter of yours.

124
00:09:06,339 --> 00:09:07,673
I guess now...

125
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:14,889
- Frida?
- Hello, Maria.

126
00:09:36,661 --> 00:09:37,870
Maria!

127
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:54,470
Maria Volkova, Russian socialite.

128
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:59,517
One minute she's here, sipping java,
and the next minute she's a mummy?

129
00:10:00,101 --> 00:10:02,353
This is the same woman
I saved from the helicopter.

130
00:10:02,979 --> 00:10:05,439
But she was young, she was full of life.

131
00:10:05,523 --> 00:10:08,609
Well, based on her signal joint
T-cell receptors,

132
00:10:08,693 --> 00:10:11,362
she was 110 years old when she died.

133
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:12,780
Damn.

134
00:10:12,989 --> 00:10:17,285
So, the helicopter accident, that wasn't
random? Someone targeted her?

135
00:10:17,493 --> 00:10:21,205
Not just any someone. You see
the kinetic energy levels on the body?

136
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:23,058
Yeah. They're almost zero.

137
00:10:23,082 --> 00:10:24,542
Like someone removed it all.

138
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,127
Therefore slowing down the victim.

139
00:10:26,544 --> 00:10:28,754
Which is how Maria
was aged so many years.

140
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,191
I mean, in real time,
it would have been like a second passed,

141
00:10:31,215 --> 00:10:33,509
but for her, it was almost a century.

142
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:36,679
Why does this feel so familiar?
Wasn't there someone who could like...

143
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:38,681
- If you're thinking it's Turtle...
- Yeah.

144
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:39,974
It's not.

145
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:43,060
This meta doesn't just slow down time.

146
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:47,565
She can create potential energy
force fields around individual victims,

147
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,776
aging them centuries
in the blink of an eye.

148
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,822
This wasn't Turtle. This was Turtle 2.0.

149
00:10:58,284 --> 00:11:00,721
Sorry. I was just waiting for you
to come up with a better name.

150
00:11:00,745 --> 00:11:02,538
No, it's "Turtle 2.0." Less is more.

151
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,958
Well, what matters is her real name.
Mrs. Frida Novikov.

152
00:11:06,459 --> 00:11:08,478
We busted her for running
an international drug ring

153
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:09,462
out of her apartment.

154
00:11:09,463 --> 00:11:12,549
- We deported her back to Russia.
- Well, apparently she didn't stay put.

155
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:15,968
Everywhere I went on my trip,
I heard stories about Novikov.

156
00:11:16,052 --> 00:11:18,429
I came home early
to check out her old haunts

157
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,514
and maybe find a clue
about what she's up to.

158
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:24,018
I just didn't expect
she'd come back home, too.

159
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:27,688
Well, we better figure out why
she's back before she ages anybody else.

160
00:11:27,772 --> 00:11:29,899
- Yeah, I'm gonna go pull her file.
- Okay.

161
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:33,694
Thanks. I'll see if I can work up a way
to take the wind out of her sails.

162
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:34,778
For good.

163
00:11:42,036 --> 00:11:43,287
The prodigal hacker returns.

164
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:49,794
Regale me with the adventures
of the great globe-trotting Ciscolorian.

165
00:11:51,379 --> 00:11:52,755
I'll tell you all about it later.

166
00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:55,966
Right now, I'm trying to stop a meta
who can slow down time

167
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,386
by reworking the Velocity X formula

168
00:11:58,594 --> 00:12:02,014
to speed her up and neutralize
her kinetic energy meta power.

169
00:12:02,098 --> 00:12:03,891
So, I'm gonna focus on that.

170
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:08,104
Knock, knock, Doc.
I just need your... I need to know...

171
00:12:09,063 --> 00:12:10,606
if on your trip,

172
00:12:12,108 --> 00:12:14,944
you saw anyone else
from any other Earths.

173
00:12:15,152 --> 00:12:16,862
- Other people?
- That's right.

174
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:19,281
- From other Earths?
- That's right.

175
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,075
Uh, okay. Not really,

176
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:24,495
because any doppelgangers
who managed to make it here,

177
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:28,499
they would all be dead by now
due to neurological degeneration.

178
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,168
What if they were already dead?

179
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:42,388
- You got to be kidding me.
- What?

180
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:46,809
The great myth-buster
suddenly believes in ghosts.

181
00:12:49,228 --> 00:12:52,731
No, I'm not talking ghosts.
I'm talking survivors.

182
00:12:52,815 --> 00:12:54,942
Oh, "Survivors."

183
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:56,360
- Yeah.
- Sure. Spooky.

184
00:12:56,444 --> 00:13:02,450
Look, survivors, ghosts, whatever you
want to call them, it's not possible.

185
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:04,535
Crisis made sure of that, remember?

186
00:13:04,618 --> 00:13:06,787
You wouldn't have been able
to see anything like that.

187
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,040
All right, fine. Well, then you missed
something out there.

188
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:12,185
- I missed something?
- You missed something because...

189
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:15,796
Do you know how many hours,
how much time and energy I spent

190
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,673
cataloguing everything I saw out there?

191
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:19,796
I need your help finding an answer
that makes sense.

192
00:13:20,426 --> 00:13:22,803
Okay, so draw up
your little Velocity F...

193
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:24,180
- "X."
- X.

194
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:26,116
And help me track something
that really matters.

195
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,393
I'm trying to find a criminal
I've been after for weeks. That matters.

196
00:13:29,477 --> 00:13:32,438
To you.
Well, I guess on all your travels,

197
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:36,484
you finally learned to focus
on someone else besides yourself. Not.

198
00:13:41,155 --> 00:13:43,616
- Nash? Need something?
- Nope.

199
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:51,040
Barry's acting
like nothing is wrong.

200
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:57,379
I shouldn't get frustrated.
Amala says pride is the enemy of peace.

201
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:00,233
You know, I don't think Barry
will ever have

202
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:02,551
the same relationship with
the Speed Force that you do.

203
00:14:04,345 --> 00:14:07,181
- Not after what happened.
- What do you mean?

204
00:14:07,515 --> 00:14:09,350
Well, I don't know the full story,

205
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:14,772
but last fall, Barry and the Speed Force
had an incident.

206
00:14:16,607 --> 00:14:18,275
He did not tell me that.

207
00:14:20,236 --> 00:14:21,796
Maybe he's trying to work up the nerve.

208
00:14:21,862 --> 00:14:25,824
Maybe. But if that disturbance
you're sensing is real,

209
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:28,702
do you really have time to waste here?

210
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:36,669
Okay, you two are seriously
the best-looking siblings in the world.

211
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:40,297
The Abhidharma teaches us
to avoid self-infatuation.

212
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:43,175
But I may need you to forward me
a copy of that one.

213
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:46,165
- See you later.
- Bye.

214
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:48,764
Pretty cool camera, right?

215
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:51,058
I asked Cisco to pick it up
from Quimby Labs in Germany,

216
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:53,018
but he definitely
made some modifications.

217
00:14:53,102 --> 00:14:54,702
You need to delete that photo right now.

218
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:56,229
Why?

219
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:58,566
We shouldn't be taking photos
of <i>Citizen</i> employees.

220
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:00,150
I mean, if that got online,

221
00:15:00,568 --> 00:15:03,320
another of Black Hole's assassins
like Hoshi could track our moves.

222
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,281
Right. Sorry.

223
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:18,961
Hey, did you talk to Joe?
He was gonna pull Novikov's file.

224
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:21,130
What happened between
you and the Speed Force, Barry?

225
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,966
Wally, I...

226
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:27,803
- I'm working a case, all right? I...
- If something bad happened,

227
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,806
that might be what's causing
all these problems with our powers.

228
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:33,368
You don't know
what you're talking about.

229
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:38,731
I believe that you can solve this,
Barry, if you face the Speed Force.

230
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:40,566
- I can't.
- Why not?

231
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:43,402
- It doesn't want to talk to me.
- How do you know that?

232
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:48,282
Because an enemy infected my mind
with nightmares and visions.

233
00:15:51,827 --> 00:15:53,827
When it...
when it tried to help me, I attacked it.

234
00:15:54,997 --> 00:15:57,237
So, if you think the Speed Force
wants to hear from me...

235
00:15:57,374 --> 00:15:59,877
- Barry...
- ...then you don't understand

236
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,440
- what the Speed Force wants.
- Barry.

237
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:03,714
We're already here.

238
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:14,141
We're in the Speed Force.
You took me in here?

239
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:21,815
Something is wrong.

240
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:24,443
We need to find it.

241
00:16:25,361 --> 00:16:27,029
What the hell is that?

242
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:31,033
Wally.

243
00:16:33,369 --> 00:16:34,578
This is my old room.

244
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,756
What's... what's going on?

245
00:16:46,382 --> 00:16:48,008
What's happening to the Speed Force?

246
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:50,344
We are dying, Barry Allen.

247
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:55,057
That's not... How...
how is that possible?

248
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:57,726
Because of what you did.

249
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:09,029
No. No, Wally, we have to go back.
I have to talk to her.

250
00:17:09,113 --> 00:17:13,117
- I have to talk to her.
- Barry, what did you do?

251
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:23,085
The Speed Force, it's dying.
This is why our powers are broken.

252
00:17:23,502 --> 00:17:25,629
This is what we have been
sensing this whole time.

253
00:17:25,713 --> 00:17:29,133
Look, it's not possible.

254
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:32,136
All right, I mean, the Speed Force is
an infinite source of energy.

255
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:35,139
It's like gravity or light.
It doesn't just die.

256
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:36,765
No, it didn't just die, Barry.

257
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:39,393
She said it's dying
because of what you did.

258
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:44,106
Barry, this is your fault.

259
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,527
Ramsey was infecting me.
I didn't have a choice.

260
00:17:48,944 --> 00:17:50,821
I'm not even talking about
what you did to her.

261
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,531
I'm talking about what you did after.

262
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:57,244
You betrayed the Speed Force months ago.
And you didn't say nothing then.

263
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:59,305
You didn't say nothing when you
came back from Crisis, either,

264
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:01,641
and you started noticing something
was wrong with your powers.

265
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:05,169
You could have told me, Barry.
We might have gone into the Speed Force.

266
00:18:05,252 --> 00:18:06,896
We might have saved it
before it was too late.

267
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,882
- I didn't...
- But instead, you blew me off.

268
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:11,258
Again and again.

269
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:14,553
Wally, I didn't... I didn't know
anyone else was affected.

270
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:17,347
- Oh.
- All right? I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

271
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:20,976
Barry, you don't get it.
We are all connected.

272
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,729
When I used to talk
with the Speed Force,

273
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:26,482
sometimes it would show me visions
of different futures.

274
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:29,735
Different possibilities
of how things could go.

275
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:33,530
There was always
one common thread.

276
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:37,951
There was always a speedster
that would pick up our mantles.

277
00:18:38,786 --> 00:18:41,705
Like a chain of lightning,
stretching through centuries.

278
00:18:43,749 --> 00:18:45,417
I saw my kids...

279
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:48,253
running with their kids.

280
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:51,048
I saw Nora.

281
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:55,677
But now that chain of lightning...

282
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:58,680
it ends with us.

283
00:18:58,889 --> 00:19:01,642
Okay, Wally,
it's not too late, though, all right?

284
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:04,728
I mean, we still have our speed.
We can go back in there.

285
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:06,772
- I can save her.
- No. You saw it, Barry.

286
00:19:06,855 --> 00:19:08,816
The Speed Force is beyond repair.

287
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:12,569
And if you think
that I'm gonna bring you back in

288
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:14,655
after everything that you have done...

289
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:15,988
Wally.

290
00:19:16,615 --> 00:19:20,619
- You need to find another teacher.
- Wally. We... we...

291
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,285
The tachyon enhancer's ready.

292
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:03,745
I can't project my consciousness
into the Speed Force,

293
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:06,456
so I need you to monitor my position
while I enter it physically.

294
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,000
Certainly, Barry Allen.

295
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:10,460
Okay, start the protocol.

296
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:21,805
Ah, my beautiful boy.

297
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:25,100
- You came back.
- Of course I did.

298
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:29,104
You said the Speed Force is dying.

299
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:34,234
I see this lightning everywhere.
I can fix it, though.

300
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:36,528
You just tell me what to do
and I'll do it.

301
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:39,448
- It's too late.
- I won't accept that.

302
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:43,744
I caused this.
I... I have to save you.

303
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:45,245
You didn't hurt me.

304
00:20:45,829 --> 00:20:49,333
I attacked you.
Do you remember?

305
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:52,836
Barry. Barry, that's not why I'm dying.

306
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:57,132
A few months ago,
a substance entered the Speed Force.

307
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:00,552
Something that
we'd never encountered before.

308
00:21:01,053 --> 00:21:03,555
We tried to contain it,
but it contaminated us.

309
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:06,016
It upset the balance of our energies.

310
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:11,772
- The green and white lightning.
- It is infernal power...

311
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:14,524
beyond the laws of our nature.

312
00:21:17,194 --> 00:21:18,194
No.

313
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:20,381
You said you're in tune
with the multi-verse.

314
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:21,765
Does that include the Speed Force?

315
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:25,202
You could give me
the energy boost I need.

316
00:21:25,702 --> 00:21:28,956
During Crisis, I made the Spectre
give me his energy

317
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,041
so I could enter the Speed Force again.

318
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:36,797
I am responsible.

319
00:21:38,924 --> 00:21:40,092
I did this.

320
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:44,179
I killed the Speed Force.

321
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:49,726
I didn't know. I didn't know.
I never would have... I'm sorry.

322
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,938
- I didn't know.
- Barry Allen, we forgive you.

323
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:57,734
You did the right thing.
You saved our universe.

324
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:00,946
You never could have foreseen
what that caused.

325
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:09,871
You only have a few steps left
before we're gone from you entirely.

326
00:22:10,163 --> 00:22:12,457
But I know you will use them well.

327
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,127
The lightning chose you.

328
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:20,465
And it was the best decision that we...
I ever made.

329
00:22:21,341 --> 00:22:24,136
You showed us the greatest force of all.

330
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,060
I love you.

331
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:34,438
I love you.

332
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:37,983
I love you...

333
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:40,736
my beautiful...

334
00:22:42,738 --> 00:22:44,197
My beautiful boy.

335
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,161
Mom?

336
00:22:50,996 --> 00:22:53,540
Mom. Don't go, Mom.

337
00:23:00,756 --> 00:23:03,717
The Speed Force is dead?
I don't even know what to say.

338
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:07,888
- Do you still have your powers?
- From what I can figure out,

339
00:23:07,971 --> 00:23:10,974
we still have
a residual amount

340
00:23:11,058 --> 00:23:12,976
of Speed Force inside us.

341
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:17,230
But the more we use up,
the less we have left, until...

342
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:19,316
Until it's gone forever?

343
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:23,361
Oh, my God, son. I didn't...

344
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:25,285
I can't even imagine
what you're going through.

345
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:29,868
- And Barry.
- Dad, this is his fault.

346
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:32,871
He could've come to me months ago.
We might have fixed things.

347
00:23:33,205 --> 00:23:35,248
But instead,
he had to do what he always does,

348
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:37,334
and assume he's the only one
that could handle it.

349
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:39,854
But, Wally, did you even need
to tell him like that?

350
00:23:39,878 --> 00:23:43,048
I mean, we both know that Barry
will beat himself up all by himself.

351
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:44,882
He will.

352
00:23:50,055 --> 00:23:54,184
I guess that wasn't very Zen
of me at all, was it?

353
00:23:54,851 --> 00:23:58,980
Wally, sit down. Please.

354
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:06,947
Do you remember what you were like
when we first met? 'Cause I do.

355
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:11,785
You were petulant, stubborn.
Every little thing pissed you off.

356
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:14,454
You didn't want a father,
or a sister or a brother.

357
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:18,208
But look at the man that you are now,

358
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:21,628
the sensitive, intelligent,
compassionate man

359
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:22,629
that you have become.

360
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:26,968
And it's not because of some mystical
energy source out there.

361
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:30,011
It's because you did the work.

362
00:24:30,554 --> 00:24:35,517
Now your responsibility is to continue
to do the work to be that man.

363
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,810
Do you understand me, son?

364
00:24:40,856 --> 00:24:42,524
Yeah?

365
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:45,318
Captain, we've got the other informant
waiting in custody.

366
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:46,695
Thank you.

367
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:50,157
This is the Frida Novikov case.

368
00:24:50,657 --> 00:24:53,285
She got deported because
two of our informants

369
00:24:53,368 --> 00:24:54,661
were part of her smuggling ring.

370
00:24:54,744 --> 00:24:59,541
One of them being your friend from
the helicopter accident, Maria Volkova.

371
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:02,544
That's why Novikov targeted Maria.
She's out for revenge.

372
00:25:02,627 --> 00:25:05,672
Well, the other informant
I'm gonna put in WITSEC soon.

373
00:25:06,756 --> 00:25:10,427
I will find you later, okay?

374
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:18,059
Hey. Whatever you're going through
with the Speed Force and your powers,

375
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:22,147
Barry is going through the same thing.
Remember that.

376
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:24,941
- I love you.
- I love you.

377
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:35,994
Not right now, Cait.
I'm busy with the mobile Barry unit.

378
00:25:36,328 --> 00:25:37,662
Let me get this straight.

379
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:41,208
You were trying to bioengineer a formula
to stop a meta-human,

380
00:25:41,374 --> 00:25:45,128
and rather than call your friend,
who's a bioengineer,

381
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:47,797
- you went with Bluetooth?
- Yeah.

382
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:49,674
I'm trying to stop Turtle 2.0 here.

383
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:52,135
Yeah, I know.
It's all you've been doing.

384
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:53,237
You don't have any time for me.

385
00:25:53,261 --> 00:25:55,364
You totally blew off Nash
when he asked for your help.

386
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:57,268
I mean, you might as well
still be on your trip.

387
00:25:57,307 --> 00:25:59,851
Yeah, well, maybe my trip
didn't turn out exactly as planned.

388
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:01,519
What are you talking about?

389
00:26:01,603 --> 00:26:06,483
You got to raid Egyptian tombs
and explore Atlantis.

390
00:26:06,566 --> 00:26:09,361
I thought after all those adventures,
I would come back different.

391
00:26:09,444 --> 00:26:14,574
Like Wally, or like you and Frost.
But I went around the world and I...

392
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:20,580
and I feel like
I'm back where I started.

393
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:25,126
Cisco, I know you feel responsible,
but we're gonna stop Turtle 2.0.

394
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:28,421
I promise. We're Team Flash.
It's what we do.

395
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:33,426
But in the meantime,
I wonder if maybe you don't have

396
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,929
some other responsibilities
that you'd like to address.

397
00:26:36,638 --> 00:26:38,723
Ones that are a little closer to home.

398
00:26:41,977 --> 00:26:45,897
Yeah. You're right. You're right.

399
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,485
While I'm doing that,

400
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:53,822
maybe my friend, the bioengineer,
would like to take over.

401
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:55,365
Absolutely.

402
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:03,223
I've been looking for you, man.

403
00:27:04,457 --> 00:27:06,126
I thought maybe you'd be home.

404
00:27:07,794 --> 00:27:08,794
No.

405
00:27:12,215 --> 00:27:14,592
I'm not ready to tell Iris.

406
00:27:19,514 --> 00:27:20,765
I'm not ready to tell anyone.

407
00:27:24,352 --> 00:27:27,147
I found out what really happened
to the Speed Force.

408
00:27:31,527 --> 00:27:33,987
It died because of
what I did in Crisis.

409
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:38,783
I took the Spectre's energy
so I could enter the Speed Force.

410
00:27:40,452 --> 00:27:46,958
His energy started a meltdown,
and now it's gone, Wally.

411
00:27:49,002 --> 00:27:52,255
For good. Because of what I did.

412
00:27:53,673 --> 00:27:55,550
You were trying to save the universe.

413
00:27:57,844 --> 00:27:59,596
Any hero would have made that call.

414
00:28:02,766 --> 00:28:04,351
I would've made that call.

415
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:16,738
Amala told me a story once
about a mother who lost her only son.

416
00:28:19,741 --> 00:28:23,203
She was so heartbroken, she asked
the Buddha to bring him back to life.

417
00:28:25,288 --> 00:28:26,706
He said he would...

418
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:29,834
but he had one request.

419
00:28:31,586 --> 00:28:35,757
A mustard seed, from a family
that had never lost a loved one.

420
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:39,594
So, she went from neighbor to neighbor
asking for seeds,

421
00:28:39,886 --> 00:28:43,848
and when she would ask, "Has anyone
in your family lost someone?"

422
00:28:45,725 --> 00:28:48,561
the answer was always yes.

423
00:28:48,937 --> 00:28:51,022
The Buddha was trying
to have her understand

424
00:28:51,106 --> 00:28:55,110
that as much as she suffered,
she wasn't alone.

425
00:28:56,945 --> 00:28:58,988
When I found out
the Speed Force was dying...

426
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:02,659
I forgot how much
you were suffering, too.

427
00:29:05,495 --> 00:29:08,081
And I'm sorry. I am.

428
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:13,086
I did this. I deserve your anger.

429
00:29:14,045 --> 00:29:15,338
So do something with it.

430
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:18,501
We can't punish ourselves
for the mistakes we've made.

431
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:20,468
That's a closed door.

432
00:29:21,886 --> 00:29:24,764
But we can take responsibility
for our actions.

433
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:29,227
No matter how great
the obstacle to overcome.

434
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:31,646
Amala teach you that, too?

435
00:29:32,397 --> 00:29:35,525
No. You did.

436
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:39,880
<i>Guys, we've got a problem.</i>

437
00:29:39,904 --> 00:29:42,782
Facial rec just picked up Frida Novikov
outside C.C.P.D.

438
00:29:48,204 --> 00:29:51,458
You really think one criminal
is worth all this backup?

439
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:54,252
If this file is right, I don't think
Novikov is gonna give up,

440
00:29:54,335 --> 00:29:58,089
and I'm not putting another informant
into WITSEC unless we're prepared.

441
00:30:04,512 --> 00:30:08,433
<i>Pomedlenneye,</i> Captain. Slow down.

442
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:22,197
Where is Olga Zhuravlev?
I know she's here. Bring her to me.

443
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,324
So you can turn her
into a pile of bones?

444
00:30:24,866 --> 00:30:28,995
I'm just taking from her
what she stole from me. Time.

445
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:33,708
<i>Now, you have five minutes to
bring her to me, or you all will die.</i>

446
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:35,043
She has Joe.

447
00:30:35,126 --> 00:30:37,003
Cisco was working on a way
to stop Novikov.

448
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:38,087
So where is he?

449
00:30:41,424 --> 00:30:42,550
Come in.

450
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:50,433
I wanted to apologize for being a jerk.

451
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:53,603
But I want to make it right.

452
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:59,651
So, what do you say we do some
multi-versal ghost-busting?

453
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:07,325
Uh, Crisis.
A gift that keeps on giving, huh?

454
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:16,667
You're not Nash.

455
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:20,421
Hello, Cisco.

456
00:31:26,469 --> 00:31:31,099
- Thawne?
- That's right. Now, where were we?

457
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:35,812
Goodbye.

458
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:47,699
You're in Nash's body. No powers.

459
00:32:15,393 --> 00:32:17,228
I don't need my powers to kill you.

460
00:32:31,826 --> 00:32:32,994
Nash?

461
00:32:34,495 --> 00:32:36,122
But he's so full of hatred.

462
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:39,292
That's not Nash.

463
00:32:42,712 --> 00:32:44,714
The new Velocity X
is ready to use on Novikov.

464
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:46,633
I just have to put it
into an injector gun.

465
00:32:46,716 --> 00:32:49,927
- Okay.
- But we can't run it there.

466
00:32:50,011 --> 00:32:52,731
If we do, we use up speed, and we have
no idea how much we have left.

467
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:55,016
Yes, we can.
We just have to use it responsibly.

468
00:32:58,936 --> 00:33:02,231
Okay, the fastest route to C.C.P.D.
is in a straight line. We can run it.

469
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,400
We just have to phase as we go.

470
00:33:05,526 --> 00:33:06,526
It's ready.

471
00:33:07,862 --> 00:33:09,947
- You with me?
- Always.

472
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:27,423
Time's up, Captain.

473
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:31,219
Novikov, stop.
You don't have to do this.

474
00:33:31,552 --> 00:33:34,180
I know I don't have to. I want to.

475
00:34:17,724 --> 00:34:20,351
Zip off again
and I'll age him 1,000 years.

476
00:34:20,435 --> 00:34:21,519
Listen to me. Listen.

477
00:34:21,602 --> 00:34:24,105
We can't do anything
to make up for the time that you lost.

478
00:34:24,439 --> 00:34:27,108
But if you take responsibility
for the time that you have left,

479
00:34:28,151 --> 00:34:31,070
you won't lose any more. I promise.

480
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:34,282
Please. Let us help you.

481
00:34:35,491 --> 00:34:37,160
I don't want your help.

482
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:41,122
We know. Thanks for the tip, Flash.

483
00:34:50,715 --> 00:34:54,510
Let's see how you handle
our version of time.

484
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:04,437
I held her in my arms.

485
00:35:08,483 --> 00:35:10,193
I watched her die all over again.

486
00:35:14,822 --> 00:35:16,783
The Speed Force is dead because of me.

487
00:35:18,201 --> 00:35:21,913
Because of my choices.
I just wanted to save everyone.

488
00:35:24,207 --> 00:35:26,501
- Save you.
- And you did.

489
00:35:30,087 --> 00:35:31,464
Barry, none of this is your fault.

490
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,383
Now I won't be able to save anyone.

491
00:35:40,264 --> 00:35:42,475
What am I supposed to do
without my speed?

492
00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:47,605
Maybe this is for the best.

493
00:35:49,065 --> 00:35:50,065
What?

494
00:35:50,399 --> 00:35:52,568
Everything happens for a reason, right?

495
00:35:54,403 --> 00:35:56,489
Maybe you weren't supposed
to be the Flash forever.

496
00:35:58,282 --> 00:35:59,283
I mean, don't you think

497
00:35:59,367 --> 00:36:01,828
that after everything
the Speed Force has put you through,

498
00:36:01,911 --> 00:36:04,413
all the pain, all the heartache,
all the death...

499
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:08,751
Don't you think you deserve a real life?

500
00:36:09,377 --> 00:36:12,129
Barry, all the world's problems
on your shoulders,

501
00:36:12,213 --> 00:36:14,173
that shouldn't have been
your burden to bear.

502
00:36:14,465 --> 00:36:17,927
- You're serious?
- I am.

503
00:36:18,761 --> 00:36:22,139
This could be our chance
to have a normal life.

504
00:36:22,765 --> 00:36:24,016
To start a family.

505
00:36:25,226 --> 00:36:27,937
You deserve to be happy
just like everyone else.

506
00:36:30,982 --> 00:36:33,025
Don't you want that?

507
00:36:33,109 --> 00:36:35,128
<i>Barry, we need you
in The Pipeline right now.</i>

508
00:36:35,152 --> 00:36:36,737
<i>There's something you need to see.</i>

509
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:50,376
Somehow he's taken over
Nash's body.

510
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:56,757
- Hi, Flash.
- Thawne.

511
00:36:58,843 --> 00:37:01,846
- What do you want?
- What do I always want?

512
00:37:05,516 --> 00:37:06,601
To kill you.

513
00:37:07,852 --> 00:37:09,478
And I'm done being patient.

514
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:15,651
I can't wait to slit your throat.

515
00:37:17,778 --> 00:37:20,197
When I do... When I get out...

516
00:37:21,866 --> 00:37:22,992
Believe me.

517
00:37:25,786 --> 00:37:26,913
I will get out.

518
00:37:29,457 --> 00:37:30,833
I'm going to kill you.

519
00:37:33,586 --> 00:37:35,671
And then I'm going to kill your family.

520
00:37:36,547 --> 00:37:39,717
And then I'm going to kill your friends.

521
00:37:43,763 --> 00:37:45,890
I'm going to kill all your friends.

522
00:37:46,474 --> 00:37:49,518
Starting with your new pal, Nash.

523
00:37:51,145 --> 00:37:52,605
- No.
- No?

524
00:37:52,939 --> 00:37:55,524
Whatever you've done to him,
we're gonna stop you.

525
00:37:58,319 --> 00:37:59,654
But isn't it true...

526
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:06,577
that in a few short weeks,
you're going to be powerless to stop me?

527
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,123
Right? Because your Speed Force is dead.

528
00:38:12,249 --> 00:38:13,376
I can feel it.

529
00:38:14,085 --> 00:38:18,673
That's what you get, Barry, for trusting
such a puny, pathetic force.

530
00:38:18,756 --> 00:38:22,176
That's why I built my own.
And I'm coming.

531
00:38:25,471 --> 00:38:27,014
I'm coming for you.

532
00:38:29,475 --> 00:38:30,601
We're done here.

533
00:38:31,769 --> 00:38:32,770
Tick-tock.

534
00:38:38,359 --> 00:38:39,527
Hey.

535
00:38:41,821 --> 00:38:44,323
What did he mean,
the Speed Force is dead?

536
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:55,375
Hey.

537
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:01,048
You sure you want to go already?

538
00:39:02,591 --> 00:39:05,970
If I'm gonna get to the next Peace Corps
project in time, I got to get going.

539
00:39:06,429 --> 00:39:09,515
Well, it'll be a whole lot faster
if you just got a flight.

540
00:39:09,932 --> 00:39:12,184
I know, but I need to walk.

541
00:39:13,728 --> 00:39:15,021
I need to have an open mind,

542
00:39:15,104 --> 00:39:18,190
be ready to embrace new ways
of helping others without my powers.

543
00:39:18,858 --> 00:39:23,487
Hmm, I'm so sorry about that, son.
I obviously didn't want...

544
00:39:25,239 --> 00:39:27,074
your trip home to end like that.

545
00:39:28,075 --> 00:39:29,160
It's okay, Dad.

546
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:32,788
Even if things don't unfold
the way you expect it,

547
00:39:34,081 --> 00:39:36,000
don't be disheartened or give up.

548
00:39:37,043 --> 00:39:40,087
The one who continues to advance
will win in the end.

549
00:39:49,472 --> 00:39:51,348
You sound more like a parent
than I do now.

550
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:53,100
Oh, you know, it's a Zen thing.

551
00:39:54,977 --> 00:39:58,147
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you, too. Too damn much.

552
00:39:59,273 --> 00:40:02,401
- You be careful, okay?
- Mmm-hmm. Yes, sir.

553
00:40:04,862 --> 00:40:08,032
Dad, keep an eye on Iris for me,
will you?

554
00:40:08,949 --> 00:40:10,117
Hmm.

555
00:40:10,284 --> 00:40:13,454
There's something different about her.

556
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:16,832
Just make sure she's okay.

557
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:21,670
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

558
00:40:24,173 --> 00:40:25,424
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

559
00:40:34,767 --> 00:40:37,103
The Spectre energy, hmm.

560
00:40:37,978 --> 00:40:41,148
Okay. Yeah, well, that's just energy
we don't understand yet.

561
00:40:41,232 --> 00:40:43,067
That's something
we can figure out, right?

562
00:40:43,317 --> 00:40:46,821
Absolutely. We can run some tests,
figure out how to track it.

563
00:40:46,904 --> 00:40:50,366
Thanks, guys, but I... I want
your help with something else.

564
00:40:51,325 --> 00:40:53,077
I've been thinking about
what Thawne said.

565
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,663
You mean, how he's gonna kill us all?
Yeah, me, too.

566
00:40:56,163 --> 00:41:00,626
How he built his own power source.
The Negative Speed Force.

567
00:41:01,544 --> 00:41:03,671
If he can make one, then...

568
00:41:06,549 --> 00:41:07,633
so can we.

569
00:41:09,593 --> 00:41:11,929
I need your help to build
an artificial Speed Force.

570
00:41:13,848 --> 00:41:15,474
That's how I can get my speed back.

571
00:41:26,652 --> 00:41:28,070
Thought I deleted this.

572
00:41:36,996 --> 00:41:39,623
- Iris?
- Yeah, I'm not Iris.

573
00:41:42,334 --> 00:41:44,795
- Sorry you had to find out this way.
- Wait. No.
