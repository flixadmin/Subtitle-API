1
00:00:54,304 --> 00:00:55,848
In the beginning...

2
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,851
there was only ocean...

3
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:02,980
until the mother island emerged.

4
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,982
Te Fiti.

5
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:09,361
Her heart held the greatest power
ever known.

6
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:12,489
It could create life itself.

7
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:16,869
And Te Fiti shared it with the world.

8
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,539
But in time...

9
00:01:20,706 --> 00:01:23,709
some began to seek Te Fiti's heart.

10
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:26,003
They believed
if they could possess it...

11
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,798
the great power of creation
would be theirs.

12
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:32,342
And one day...

13
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:35,470
the most daring of them all...

14
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:40,017
voyaged across the vast ocean
to take it.

15
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,190
He was a demigod of the wind and sea.

16
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,234
He was a warrior.

17
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,737
A trickster.

18
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:57,284
A shapeshifter who
could change form...

19
00:01:57,451 --> 00:02:00,204
with the power of his magical fish hook.

20
00:02:02,039 --> 00:02:03,332
And his name...

21
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,376
was Maui.

22
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,516
But without her heart,
Te Fiti began to crumble...

23
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:23,310
giving birth to a terrible darkness.

24
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,164
Maui tried to escape...

25
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:48,001
but was confronted by another
who sought the heart.

26
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,421
Te Kā!

27
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:54,591
A demon of earth and fire.

28
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:05,227
Maui was struck from the sky...

29
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,856
never to be seen again.

30
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:14,111
And his magical fish hook
and the heart of Te Fiti...

31
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:17,072
were lost to the sea.

32
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,408
Where, even now...

33
00:03:19,575 --> 00:03:21,535
1,000 years later...

34
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:24,288
Te Kā and the demons of the deep...

35
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,290
still hunt for the heart.

36
00:03:26,874 --> 00:03:30,794
Hiding in a darkness
that will continue to spread...

37
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,422
chasing away our fish...

38
00:03:33,589 --> 00:03:36,633
draining the life
from island after island...

39
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:40,220
until every one of us is devoured...

40
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:43,056
by the bloodthirsty jaws...

41
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:45,809
of inescapable death!

42
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,816
But one day...

43
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:54,818
the heart will be found...

44
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,238
by someone who will journey
beyond our reef...

45
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,615
find Maui...

46
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,992
deliver him across the great ocean...

47
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,328
to restore Te Fiti's heart...

48
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,538
and save us all.

49
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,707
Thank you, Mother. That's enough.

50
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:09,750
Papa.

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,835
No one goes outside the reef.

52
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:15,088
We are safe here.
There is no darkness.

53
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,007
There are no monsters.

54
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:20,844
Monsters!

55
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,013
-There's no monsters, no monsters...
-It's the darkness!

56
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,351
No, there is nothing beyond our reef,
but storms and rough seas.

57
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:28,644
I'm gonna throw up.

58
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,647
As long as we stay
on our very safe island...

59
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:32,981
...we'll be fine.

60
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,525
The legends are true.

61
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,360
Someone will have to go.

62
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,529
Mother, Motunui is paradise.

63
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:41,532
Who would want to go anywhere else?

64
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,903
Shoo, shoo!

65
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:01,880
Moana!

66
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,857
There you are, Moana.
What are you doing? You scared me.

67
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,692
What? I wanna's go back.

68
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:25,320
I know, I know.
But you don't go out there.

69
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:26,488
It's dangerous.

70
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,701
Moana, come on.

71
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:32,744
Let's go back to the village.

72
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,915
You are the next great chief
of our people.

73
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:40,085
And you will do wondrous things,
my little minnow.

74
00:07:40,794 --> 00:07:44,464
Oh, yes. But first, you must learn
where you're meant to be.

75
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:58,478
Moana

76
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,023
Make way, make way

77
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,066
Moana, it's time you knew

78
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:06,904
The village of Motunui is all you need

79
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:09,072
The dancers are practicing

80
00:08:09,448 --> 00:08:11,700
They dance to an ancient song

81
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:14,745
Who needs a new song
This old one's all we need

82
00:08:15,078 --> 00:08:16,788
This tradition is our mission

83
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:19,583
And Moana, there's so much to do

84
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:21,126
Don't trip on the taro root

85
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:23,420
That's all you need

86
00:08:23,754 --> 00:08:25,547
We share everything we make

87
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,591
We joke and we weave our baskets

88
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:29,927
The fishermen come back from the sea

89
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,720
I wanna see

90
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:33,597
Don't walk away

91
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:35,557
Moana, stay on the ground now

92
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:37,601
Our people will need a chief

93
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,645
-And there you are
-There you are

94
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,897
There comes a day

95
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:45,776
When you're gonna look around
And realize happiness is

96
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,611
Where you are

97
00:08:48,028 --> 00:08:49,530
Consider the coconut

98
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,823
-The what
-Consider its tree

99
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:55,285
We use each part of the coconut
It's all we need

100
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,038
We make our nets from the fibers

101
00:08:58,413 --> 00:08:59,998
The water is sweet inside

102
00:09:00,374 --> 00:09:04,294
We use the leaves to build fires
We cook up the meat inside

103
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,296
Consider the coconuts

104
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,048
The trunks and the leaves

105
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:10,717
The island gives us what we need

106
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,803
And no one leaves

107
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,429
That's right, we stay

108
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,181
We're safe and we're well-provided

109
00:09:16,557 --> 00:09:18,267
And when we look to the future

110
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:20,561
There you are

111
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:22,813
You'll be okay

112
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,773
In time you'll learn just as I did

113
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,485
You must find happiness
right where you are

114
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:39,162
I like to dance with the water
The undertow and the waves

115
00:09:39,329 --> 00:09:43,333
The water is mischievous
Ha! I like how it misbehaves

116
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,337
The village may think I'm crazy
Or say that I drift too far

117
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:52,092
But once you know what you like
Well, there you are

118
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:58,140
You are your father's daughter
Stubbornness and pride

119
00:09:58,307 --> 00:10:02,519
Mind what he says but remember
You may hear a voice inside

120
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:06,857
And if the voice starts to whisper
To follow the farthest star

121
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:11,820
Moana, that voice inside
is who you are

122
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,782
Dad!

123
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:19,161
I was only looking at the boats.
I wasn't gonna get on 'em.

124
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,627
Come on.
There's something I need to show you.

125
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:32,007
I've wanted to bring you here from
the moment you opened your eyes.

126
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:34,676
This is a sacred place.

127
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:36,887
A place of chiefs.

128
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:38,722
There will come a time...

129
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:43,769
when you will stand on this peak
and place a stone on this mountain.

130
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,563
Like I did. Like my father did.

131
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,567
And his father, and every chief
that has ever been.

132
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:52,861
And on that day...

133
00:10:53,237 --> 00:10:55,113
when you add your stone...

134
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:58,825
you will raise this whole island higher.

135
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:01,995
You are the future
of our people, Moana.

136
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:04,706
And they are not out there.

137
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:07,668
They are right here.

138
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:11,088
It's time to be who they need you to be.

139
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:15,342
-We make our nets from the fibers
-We weave our nets from the fibers

140
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:16,718
-The water is sweet inside
-A real tasty treat inside

141
00:11:16,802 --> 00:11:18,971
-We use the leaves to build fires
-We sing these songs in our choirs

142
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:20,973
-To cook up the meat inside
-We have mouths to feed inside

143
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,100
-The village believes in us
-That's right

144
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:24,768
The village believes

145
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:27,104
The island gives us what we need

146
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:29,231
And no one leaves

147
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:30,774
So here I'll stay

148
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:34,778
My home, my people beside me
And when I think of tomorrow

149
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:36,989
There we are

150
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:38,949
I'll lead the way

151
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:41,118
I'll have my people to guide me

152
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:42,911
We'll build our future together

153
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:45,122
Where we are

154
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:46,999
'Cause every path leads ya back to

155
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:48,625
Where you are

156
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,086
You can find happiness right

157
00:11:51,503 --> 00:11:53,130
Where you are

158
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:56,300
Where you are

159
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:03,640
And every storm, this roof leaks,
no matter how many fronds I add.

160
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:04,641
Fixed!

161
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:06,101
Not the fronds.

162
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:09,813
Wind shifted the post.

163
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:13,066
That's good pork!

164
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:17,654
I didn't mean... I wasn't...

165
00:12:17,821 --> 00:12:21,825
What? They're calling me, so I gotta...
Bye!

166
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:25,829
You're doing great.

167
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:27,414
Is it done yet?

168
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:30,918
So close.

169
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,727
I'm curious about that chicken
eating the rock.

170
00:12:48,852 --> 00:12:53,815
He seems to lack the basic intelligence
required for pretty much everything.

171
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:56,902
Should we maybe just cook him?

172
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:01,281
Sometimes our strengths lie
beneath the surface.

173
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:05,160
Far beneath in some cases.

174
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:08,789
But I'm sure there's more to Heihei
than meets the eye.

175
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:16,922
It's the harvest.

176
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:20,467
This morning,
I was husking the coconuts and...

177
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:28,267
Well...

178
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:33,313
we should clear the diseased trees
and we will start a new grove.

179
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:34,398
There.

180
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:38,193
Thanks, Moana.

181
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,362
She's doing great.

182
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:45,742
This suits you.

183
00:13:45,909 --> 00:13:46,910
Chief?

184
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:49,746
There's something you need to see.

185
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:51,748
Our traps in the east lagoon...

186
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:54,126
they're pulling up less and less fish.

187
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:56,920
Then we'll rotate the fishing grounds.

188
00:13:57,296 --> 00:13:59,256
We have. There's no fish.

189
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:02,593
Oh. Then we'll fish
the far side of the island.

190
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:03,635
We tried.

191
00:14:04,052 --> 00:14:05,262
The windward side.

192
00:14:05,721 --> 00:14:07,931
And the leeward side, the shallows,
the channel.

193
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:09,766
We've tried the whole lagoon.

194
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:12,269
They're just gone.

195
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,563
Have you tried using a different bait?

196
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,106
I don't think it's the bait.

197
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:17,774
There's no fish.

198
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:19,651
It seems like
it's getting worse and worse.

199
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:22,779
Of course, I understand
you have reason for concern.

200
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:24,990
I will talk to the council.
I'm sure we...

201
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:28,035
What if we fish beyond the reef?

202
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:31,288
No one goes beyond the reef.

203
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:33,916
I know. But if there are no fish
in the lagoon...

204
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,001
-Moana.
-And there's a whole ocean.

205
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:37,794
We have one rule.

206
00:14:38,212 --> 00:14:39,129
An old rule, when there were fish.

207
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,256
-A rule that keeps us safe...
-But Dad, I...

208
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:45,344
...instead of endangering our people
so you can run right back to the water.

209
00:14:52,017 --> 00:14:54,561
Every time I think you're past this...

210
00:14:57,189 --> 00:14:59,441
No one goes beyond the reef!

211
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:09,159
Well, it's not like you said it
in front of your dad.

212
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,328
Standing on a boat.

213
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,333
I didn't say go beyond the reef,
because I want to be on the ocean.

214
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,502
But you still do.

215
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,381
-He's hard on you because...
-Because he doesn't get me.

216
00:15:22,548 --> 00:15:25,133
Because he was you.

217
00:15:25,926 --> 00:15:27,803
Drawn to the ocean.

218
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,346
Down by the shore.

219
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,140
He took a canoe, Moana.

220
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:33,767
He crossed the reef...

221
00:15:34,726 --> 00:15:37,020
and found an unforgiving sea.

222
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,231
Waves like mountains.

223
00:15:40,274 --> 00:15:43,527
His best friend begged
to be on that boat.

224
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:46,280
Your dad couldn't save him.

225
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:51,702
He's hoping he can save you.

226
00:15:53,036 --> 00:15:54,538
Sometimes...

227
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:58,625
who we wish we were,
what we wish we could do...

228
00:16:00,294 --> 00:16:02,421
it's just not meant to be.

229
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:20,564
I've been staring at the
edge of the water

230
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:23,901
Long as I can remember

231
00:16:24,234 --> 00:16:26,987
Never really knowing why

232
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:32,743
I wish I could be the perfect daughter

233
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,746
But I come back to the water

234
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:38,123
No matter how hard I try

235
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:43,170
Every turn I take
Every trail I track

236
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,215
Every path I make
Every road leads back

237
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,926
To the place I know
Where I cannot go

238
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:51,512
Where I long to be

239
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:54,181
See the line where the
sky meets the sea

240
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:56,600
It calls me

241
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:59,603
And no one knows

242
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:02,606
How far it goes

243
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:07,903
If the wind in my sail on the sea
Stays behind me

244
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:11,615
One day I'll know

245
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:15,993
If I go, there's just no telling
how far I'll go

246
00:17:16,328 --> 00:17:19,205
I know everybody on this island

247
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,959
Seems so happy on this island

248
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,670
Everything is by design

249
00:17:26,672 --> 00:17:30,175
I know everybody on this island

250
00:17:30,551 --> 00:17:33,387
Has a role on this island

251
00:17:33,762 --> 00:17:36,139
So maybe I can roll with mine

252
00:17:37,474 --> 00:17:40,352
I can lead with pride
I can make us strong

253
00:17:40,686 --> 00:17:43,063
I'll be satisfied
If I play along

254
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:46,483
But the voice inside
Sings a different song

255
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:48,527
What is wrong with me

256
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:54,283
See the light as it shines on the sea

257
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:57,077
It's blinding

258
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:59,371
But no one knows

259
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:03,000
How deep it goes

260
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,252
And it seems like it's calling out to me

261
00:18:05,627 --> 00:18:08,213
So come find me

262
00:18:08,589 --> 00:18:10,924
And let me know

263
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:14,553
What's beyond that line
Will I cross that line

264
00:18:14,928 --> 00:18:16,763
The line where the sky meets the sea

265
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:19,683
It calls me

266
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:22,477
And no one knows

267
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:25,898
How far it goes

268
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:30,861
If the wind in my sail on the sea
stays behind me

269
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:33,697
One day I'll know

270
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:39,161
How far I'll go

271
00:18:41,872 --> 00:18:42,873
Whoa.

272
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:48,045
We're okay, Pua.

273
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:49,755
I can do this.

274
00:18:51,381 --> 00:18:54,051
There's more fish beyond the reef.

275
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:57,971
There's more beyond the reef.

276
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:07,856
Not so bad.

277
00:19:16,615 --> 00:19:17,407
Pua!

278
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:11,962
Whatever just happened...

279
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:13,422
blame it on the pig.

280
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:14,673
Gramma.

281
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:21,305
Are you gonna tell Dad?

282
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:24,892
I'm his mom.
I don't have to tell him anything.

283
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:29,897
He was right.

284
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:32,649
About going out there.

285
00:20:35,068 --> 00:20:38,155
It's time to put my stone
on the mountain.

286
00:20:40,324 --> 00:20:43,327
Okay.
Well, then, head on back.

287
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:45,829
Put that stone up there.

288
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,461
Why aren't you trying
to talk me out of it?

289
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,297
You said that's what you wanted.

290
00:20:56,256 --> 00:20:57,257
It is.

291
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:03,013
When I die...

292
00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:06,683
I'm going to come back as one of these.

293
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,978
Or I chose the wrong tattoo.

294
00:21:10,145 --> 00:21:11,813
Why are you acting weird?

295
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:15,484
I'm the village crazy lady.
That's my job.

296
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:19,821
If there's something you want to tell me,
just tell me!

297
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:22,824
Is there something
you wanna tell me?

298
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:26,203
Is there something
you want to hear?

299
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:34,044
You've been told
all our people's stories...

300
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:36,547
but one.

301
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:39,007
What is this place?

302
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:43,637
Do you really think
our ancestors stayed within the reef?

303
00:21:55,315 --> 00:21:56,984
What's in there?

304
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:01,655
The answer to the question
you keep asking yourself.

305
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:04,825
Who are you meant to be?

306
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:09,830
Go inside...

307
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:11,582
bang the drum...

308
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:14,042
and find out.

309
00:22:43,322 --> 00:22:44,114
Whoa.

310
00:22:50,204 --> 00:22:51,038
Oh.

311
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:24,154
Bang the drum.

312
00:24:55,913 --> 00:24:58,790
We read the wind and the sky

313
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:00,792
When the sun is high

314
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:03,754
We sail the length of the seas

315
00:25:04,296 --> 00:25:05,589
On the ocean breeze

316
00:25:06,089 --> 00:25:08,300
At night we name every star

317
00:25:08,634 --> 00:25:10,594
We know where we are

318
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:14,973
We know who we are
Who we are

319
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:19,937
We set a course to find

320
00:25:20,354 --> 00:25:24,650
A brand new island
everywhere we roam

321
00:25:27,528 --> 00:25:29,404
We keep our island in our mind

322
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:32,574
And when it's time to find home

323
00:25:32,741 --> 00:25:34,618
We know the way

324
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:39,623
We are explorers reading every sign

325
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:44,795
We tell the stories of our elders
In a never-ending chain

326
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:55,013
We know the way

327
00:26:00,811 --> 00:26:02,604
We were voyagers.

328
00:26:03,647 --> 00:26:04,857
We were voyagers!

329
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:08,902
We were voyagers!
We were voyagers!

330
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:10,821
We were voyagers!

331
00:26:12,322 --> 00:26:13,782
Why'd we stop?

332
00:26:14,867 --> 00:26:15,951
Maui.

333
00:26:16,577 --> 00:26:20,163
When he stole from the mother island,
darkness fell.

334
00:26:20,873 --> 00:26:22,666
Te Kā awoke.

335
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:26,587
Monsters lurked
and boats stopped coming back.

336
00:26:27,337 --> 00:26:31,008
To protect our people,
the ancient chiefs forbid voyaging...

337
00:26:31,091 --> 00:26:35,012
and now we have forgotten who we are.

338
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:39,099
And the darkness
has continued to spread...

339
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,351
chasing away our fish...

340
00:26:41,727 --> 00:26:43,270
draining the life...

341
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:47,065
from island after island.

342
00:26:50,444 --> 00:26:52,279
Our island.

343
00:26:52,905 --> 00:26:54,740
But, one day...

344
00:26:54,907 --> 00:26:58,994
someone will journey beyond our reef,
find Maui...

345
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:02,080
deliver him across the great ocean...

346
00:27:02,998 --> 00:27:06,627
to restore the heart of Te Fiti.

347
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:11,381
I was there that day.

348
00:27:11,548 --> 00:27:14,384
The ocean chose you.

349
00:27:23,185 --> 00:27:25,270
I thought it was a dream.

350
00:27:31,318 --> 00:27:32,945
Nope!

351
00:27:33,862 --> 00:27:37,616
Our ancestors
believed Maui lies there...

352
00:27:37,783 --> 00:27:39,535
at the bottom of his hook.

353
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:42,788
Follow it, and you will find him.

354
00:27:42,955 --> 00:27:46,416
But why would it choose me?

355
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:49,628
I don't even know
how to make it past the reef.

356
00:27:50,462 --> 00:27:52,422
But I know who does!

357
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:03,559
-The crops are turning black.
-What about the fish?

358
00:28:03,934 --> 00:28:05,519
This is happening all over the island.

359
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:07,062
-Please, please settle down.
-What are you going to do?

360
00:28:07,145 --> 00:28:08,981
We will dig new fields.
We will find a way to...

361
00:28:09,064 --> 00:28:11,567
We can stop the darkness!
Save our island!

362
00:28:11,942 --> 00:28:13,277
There's a cavern of boats.

363
00:28:13,652 --> 00:28:14,987
Huge canoes.

364
00:28:15,153 --> 00:28:18,740
We can take them, find Maui,
make him restore the heart.

365
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:22,369
We were voyagers.
We can voyage again!

366
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:27,207
You told me to help our people.

367
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:29,626
This is how we help our people.

368
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:31,128
Dad?

369
00:28:31,211 --> 00:28:32,129
What are you doing?

370
00:28:32,504 --> 00:28:34,798
I should've burned those boats
a long time ago!

371
00:28:34,965 --> 00:28:36,008
No! Don't!

372
00:28:36,175 --> 00:28:38,719
We have to find Maui.
We have to restore the heart!

373
00:28:39,136 --> 00:28:40,095
There is no heart!

374
00:28:40,304 --> 00:28:42,222
This is just a rock!

375
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:43,140
No!

376
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,655
Chief! It's your mother!

377
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:10,334
Mother...

378
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:27,976
What can be done?

379
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:35,275
Go.

380
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:37,152
Gramma.

381
00:29:39,947 --> 00:29:40,906
Go.

382
00:29:41,365 --> 00:29:43,867
Not now. I can't.

383
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:45,369
You must!

384
00:29:45,786 --> 00:29:48,914
The ocean chose you.

385
00:29:49,331 --> 00:29:50,582
Follow the fish hook.

386
00:29:50,749 --> 00:29:51,750
Gramma...

387
00:29:51,917 --> 00:29:54,002
And when you find Maui...

388
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:58,006
you grab him by the ear.
You say...

389
00:29:58,423 --> 00:30:01,426
"I am Moana of Motunui.

390
00:30:01,885 --> 00:30:04,012
"You will board my boat...

391
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:06,557
"sail across the sea...

392
00:30:06,723 --> 00:30:10,727
"and restore the heart of Te Fiti."

393
00:30:12,604 --> 00:30:14,898
I can't leave you.

394
00:30:15,357 --> 00:30:20,571
There is nowhere you could go
that I won't be with you.

395
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:34,918
Go!

396
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:49,558
There's a line
where the sky meets the sea

397
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:51,560
And it calls me

398
00:30:52,311 --> 00:30:54,646
But no one knows

399
00:30:54,813 --> 00:30:58,483
How far it goes

400
00:30:58,942 --> 00:31:03,614
All that time wondering where I need
to be is behind me

401
00:31:04,031 --> 00:31:06,742
I'm on my own

402
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:09,786
To worlds unknown

403
00:31:10,162 --> 00:31:12,998
Every turn I take
Every trail I track

404
00:31:13,332 --> 00:31:14,875
Is a choice I make

405
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:17,628
Now I can't turn back
from the great unknown

406
00:31:18,003 --> 00:31:21,215
Where I go alone
Where I long to be

407
00:31:30,766 --> 00:31:32,976
See her light up the night in the sea

408
00:31:33,352 --> 00:31:35,812
She calls me

409
00:31:36,188 --> 00:31:38,607
And yes, I know

410
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:41,235
That I can go

411
00:31:42,903 --> 00:31:46,406
There's a moon in the sky
And the wind is behind me

412
00:31:47,866 --> 00:31:49,952
Soon I'll know

413
00:31:50,369 --> 00:31:52,579
How far I'll go

414
00:32:12,391 --> 00:32:16,895
I am Moana of Motunui.
You will board my boat...

415
00:32:17,396 --> 00:32:21,441
sail across the sea
and restore the heart of Te Fiti.

416
00:32:21,608 --> 00:32:23,151
I am Moana...

417
00:32:24,611 --> 00:32:25,654
of Motu...

418
00:32:27,281 --> 00:32:28,407
...nui.

419
00:32:40,043 --> 00:32:41,044
Heihei?

420
00:33:03,734 --> 00:33:06,612
It's okay. You're all right.

421
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:08,405
See?

422
00:33:08,822 --> 00:33:11,617
There we go. Nice water.

423
00:33:11,783 --> 00:33:14,286
The ocean is a friend of mine.

424
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:17,623
Heihei?

425
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:19,917
Heihei!

426
00:33:35,015 --> 00:33:36,016
Stay.

427
00:33:42,022 --> 00:33:44,858
Okay. Next stop, Maui.

428
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:55,536
I am Moana of Motunui.

429
00:33:55,953 --> 00:33:58,830
You will board my boat...

430
00:33:59,706 --> 00:34:02,835
sail... across the sea...

431
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:05,128
and restore the heart of Te Fiti.

432
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:10,300
I am Moana of Motu...

433
00:34:11,385 --> 00:34:12,678
Board my boat!

434
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:16,723
Oh, no.

435
00:34:23,021 --> 00:34:24,731
No, no, no!

436
00:34:37,034 --> 00:34:38,161
Ocean...

437
00:34:38,536 --> 00:34:41,248
can I get a little help?

438
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:45,835
No, no.

439
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:48,255
Please.

440
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,630
Come on!

441
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:02,436
Help me!

442
00:35:02,936 --> 00:35:03,937
Please!

443
00:35:49,066 --> 00:35:50,150
What?

444
00:35:50,567 --> 00:35:52,110
I said help me!

445
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:54,446
And wrecking my boat?

446
00:35:54,905 --> 00:35:56,615
Not helping!

447
00:35:58,283 --> 00:36:01,203
Fish pee in you all day!

448
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:02,496
So...

449
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,427
Maui?

450
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:26,019
Maui!

451
00:36:29,314 --> 00:36:31,775
Maui, demigod of the wind and sea...

452
00:36:31,942 --> 00:36:33,652
I am Moana of Motunui.

453
00:36:33,819 --> 00:36:35,362
You will board my boat.

454
00:36:35,529 --> 00:36:37,447
No. You will board my boat.

455
00:36:37,614 --> 00:36:40,367
Yeah. I am Moana of Motunui.

456
00:36:40,784 --> 00:36:43,287
You will board my...

457
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:45,539
Boat! A boat!

458
00:36:45,622 --> 00:36:48,417
The gods have given me a...

459
00:37:02,723 --> 00:37:04,308
Maui, shapeshifter...

460
00:37:04,808 --> 00:37:06,643
demigod of the wind and sea...

461
00:37:07,019 --> 00:37:08,770
-I am Moana of...
-Hero of men.

462
00:37:08,854 --> 00:37:10,355
What?

463
00:37:10,439 --> 00:37:12,983
It's actually, Maui, shapeshifter,
demigod of the wind and sea...

464
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,318
hero of men.

465
00:37:14,484 --> 00:37:17,404
I interrupted.
From the top. Hero of men. Go.

466
00:37:19,364 --> 00:37:20,365
I am...

467
00:37:20,532 --> 00:37:21,700
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

468
00:37:22,075 --> 00:37:24,161
And women. Men and women.

469
00:37:24,328 --> 00:37:25,162
Both. All.

470
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:27,080
Not a guy, girl thing.

471
00:37:27,247 --> 00:37:28,999
You know, Maui is a hero to all.

472
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:30,292
You're doing great.

473
00:37:30,709 --> 00:37:32,002
What? No! I'm here to...

474
00:37:32,336 --> 00:37:33,504
Of course.

475
00:37:33,837 --> 00:37:35,088
Yes, yes, yes.

476
00:37:35,672 --> 00:37:37,799
Maui always has time for his fans.

477
00:37:39,426 --> 00:37:41,386
When you use a bird to write with...

478
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:43,514
it's called tweeting.

479
00:37:47,351 --> 00:37:50,145
I know, not every day
you get a chance to meet your hero.

480
00:37:51,396 --> 00:37:53,023
You are not my hero.

481
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:55,734
And I'm not here
so you can sign my oar!

482
00:37:55,901 --> 00:37:58,320
I'm here 'cause
you stole the heart of Te Fiti!

483
00:37:58,779 --> 00:38:00,739
And you will board my boat...

484
00:38:00,906 --> 00:38:04,076
and sail across the sea and put it back!

485
00:38:05,369 --> 00:38:08,789
Yeah, it almost sounded
like you don't like me...

486
00:38:08,872 --> 00:38:10,290
which is impossible because...

487
00:38:10,374 --> 00:38:12,251
I got stuck here for 1,000 years...

488
00:38:12,334 --> 00:38:14,670
trying to get the heart
as a gift for you mortals.

489
00:38:14,753 --> 00:38:17,798
So you could have the power
to create life itself.

490
00:38:18,549 --> 00:38:21,593
Yeah. So, what I believe
you were trying to say...

491
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,636
is "thank you."

492
00:38:23,053 --> 00:38:24,221
-"Thank you?"
-You're welcome.

493
00:38:24,555 --> 00:38:25,389
What? No, no, no!

494
00:38:25,806 --> 00:38:26,890
I didn't... I wasn't...

495
00:38:27,266 --> 00:38:28,058
Why would I ever say that?

496
00:38:28,433 --> 00:38:29,643
Okay, okay.

497
00:38:30,227 --> 00:38:33,480
I see what's happening
Yeah

498
00:38:33,897 --> 00:38:36,567
You're face to face with greatness
and it's strange

499
00:38:36,942 --> 00:38:38,235
You don't even know how you feel

500
00:38:38,777 --> 00:38:40,279
It's adorable

501
00:38:40,571 --> 00:38:43,073
Well it's nice to see that humans
never change

502
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:46,451
Open your eyes
Let's begin

503
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:47,870
Yes, it's really me

504
00:38:48,245 --> 00:38:49,788
It's Maui
Breathe it in

505
00:38:50,289 --> 00:38:51,999
I know it's a lot

506
00:38:52,082 --> 00:38:53,709
The hair
The bod

507
00:38:54,585 --> 00:38:56,712
When you're staring at a demigod

508
00:38:57,588 --> 00:38:59,756
What can I say except

509
00:38:59,923 --> 00:39:01,466
You're welcome

510
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,428
For the tides, the sun, the sky

511
00:39:04,845 --> 00:39:06,763
Hey, it's okay, it's okay

512
00:39:07,139 --> 00:39:08,765
You're welcome

513
00:39:08,932 --> 00:39:11,560
I'm just an ordinary demiguy
Hey!

514
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,813
What has two thumbs
and pulled up the sky

515
00:39:15,272 --> 00:39:17,107
When you were waddling yay high?

516
00:39:17,274 --> 00:39:18,400
This guy

517
00:39:18,567 --> 00:39:22,905
When the nights got cold
Who stole you fire from down below?

518
00:39:23,405 --> 00:39:25,282
You're looking at him yo

519
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:29,119
Oh also I lassoed the sun

520
00:39:29,578 --> 00:39:30,495
You're welcome

521
00:39:30,829 --> 00:39:33,123
To stretch your days and bring you fun

522
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:36,084
Also I harnessed the breeze

523
00:39:36,502 --> 00:39:37,503
You're welcome

524
00:39:37,669 --> 00:39:39,963
To fill your sails and shake your trees

525
00:39:40,422 --> 00:39:44,092
So what can I say except
You're welcome

526
00:39:44,259 --> 00:39:46,720
For the islands I pulled from the sea

527
00:39:47,304 --> 00:39:49,515
There's no need to pray
It's okay

528
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:51,016
You're welcome

529
00:39:51,141 --> 00:39:54,978
Ha
I guess it's just my way of being me

530
00:39:55,145 --> 00:39:56,021
You're welcome

531
00:39:56,813 --> 00:39:58,440
You're welcome

532
00:39:58,982 --> 00:40:00,192
Well come to think of it

533
00:40:00,817 --> 00:40:02,402
Kid, honestly I could go on and on

534
00:40:02,819 --> 00:40:04,279
I could explain every
natural phenomenon

535
00:40:04,655 --> 00:40:07,658
The tide, the grass, the ground
Oh that was Maui just messing around

536
00:40:08,116 --> 00:40:09,660
I killed an eel
I buried its guts

537
00:40:09,826 --> 00:40:11,161
Sprouted a tree
Now you got coconuts

538
00:40:11,662 --> 00:40:13,121
What's the lesson?
What is the take away?

539
00:40:13,497 --> 00:40:14,915
Don't mess with Maui
when he's on a breakaway

540
00:40:15,332 --> 00:40:18,335
And the tapestry here on my skin
Is a map of the victories I win

541
00:40:18,669 --> 00:40:20,128
Look where I've been
I make everything happen

542
00:40:20,546 --> 00:40:22,506
Look at that
Mean Mini-Maui just tickety tappin'

543
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:24,091
Ha ha
Ha ha

544
00:40:24,508 --> 00:40:26,385
Ha ha
Hey

545
00:40:26,552 --> 00:40:29,638
Well anyway let me say
You're welcome

546
00:40:29,721 --> 00:40:30,931
You're welcome

547
00:40:31,014 --> 00:40:33,642
For the wonderful world you know

548
00:40:33,809 --> 00:40:36,687
Hey, it's okay, it's okay
You're welcome

549
00:40:36,854 --> 00:40:37,855
You're welcome

550
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,691
Well come to think of it
I gotta go

551
00:40:40,858 --> 00:40:43,735
Hey it's your day to say
You're welcome

552
00:40:43,902 --> 00:40:45,028
You're welcome

553
00:40:45,195 --> 00:40:47,698
'Cause I'm gonna need that boat

554
00:40:48,115 --> 00:40:50,951
I'm sailing away away
You're welcome

555
00:40:51,034 --> 00:40:51,994
You're welcome

556
00:40:52,411 --> 00:40:54,454
'Cause Maui can do
everything but float

557
00:40:54,538 --> 00:40:56,415
-You're welcome
-You're welcome

558
00:40:56,748 --> 00:40:58,876
-You're welcome
-You're welcome

559
00:40:59,042 --> 00:41:00,043
Huh?

560
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,378
And thank you!

561
00:41:02,296 --> 00:41:03,213
Hey!

562
00:41:03,589 --> 00:41:06,884
Let me out!
You lying, slimy son of a...

563
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:10,554
You're welcome

564
00:41:12,389 --> 00:41:13,599
You're so welcome.

565
00:41:19,271 --> 00:41:21,523
No. I'm not going to Te Fiti
with some kid.

566
00:41:21,607 --> 00:41:22,608
I'm going to get my hook.

567
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:24,860
You have yours and
I'm not Maui without mine.

568
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:29,031
Okay, talk to the back.

569
00:41:34,077 --> 00:41:35,245
Boat snack.

570
00:42:01,271 --> 00:42:04,900
Good riddance,
you filthy pile of pebbles.

571
00:42:05,484 --> 00:42:07,736
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't look at me like that.

572
00:42:07,903 --> 00:42:10,447
It's a beautiful cave.
She's gonna love it.

573
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:14,243
And I'm going to love you in ma belly.

574
00:42:14,743 --> 00:42:16,787
Now, let's fatten you up, drumstick.

575
00:42:40,018 --> 00:42:42,271
I could watch that all day.

576
00:42:42,437 --> 00:42:44,147
Okay. Enjoy the island.

577
00:42:44,523 --> 00:42:45,649
Maui, out.

578
00:42:45,816 --> 00:42:47,109
No! Stop!

579
00:42:47,484 --> 00:42:50,320
Hey! You have to put back the heart!

580
00:43:06,003 --> 00:43:07,588
Did not see that coming.

581
00:43:09,673 --> 00:43:12,759
I am Moana of Motunui.

582
00:43:12,926 --> 00:43:14,094
This is my canoe...

583
00:43:14,511 --> 00:43:16,013
and you will journey to...

584
00:43:19,266 --> 00:43:20,851
All right, get over it.
We gotta move.

585
00:43:23,103 --> 00:43:23,979
And she's back.

586
00:43:24,438 --> 00:43:27,482
I am Moana of Motunui...

587
00:43:31,862 --> 00:43:33,614
It was Moana, right?

588
00:43:33,697 --> 00:43:34,364
Yes.

589
00:43:34,781 --> 00:43:36,950
And you will restore the heart!

590
00:43:48,378 --> 00:43:49,254
All right. I'm out.

591
00:43:54,843 --> 00:43:56,053
Oh, come on!

592
00:43:57,012 --> 00:43:58,597
What is your problem?

593
00:44:00,557 --> 00:44:02,059
Are you afraid of it?

594
00:44:02,518 --> 00:44:03,894
No! No.

595
00:44:04,478 --> 00:44:05,395
I'm not afraid.

596
00:44:09,316 --> 00:44:11,401
Stay out of it
or you're sleeping in my armpit.

597
00:44:11,568 --> 00:44:12,569
You, stop it.

598
00:44:12,736 --> 00:44:15,405
That is not a heart. It is a curse.

599
00:44:15,572 --> 00:44:17,699
The second I took it,
I got blasted outta the sky...

600
00:44:17,866 --> 00:44:19,034
and I lost my hook.

601
00:44:19,201 --> 00:44:20,369
Get it away from me.

602
00:44:20,827 --> 00:44:22,204
Get this away?

603
00:44:22,579 --> 00:44:24,331
Hey, hey, hey! I'm a demigod, okay?

604
00:44:24,498 --> 00:44:26,166
Stop that. I will smite you!

605
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:28,001
You wanna get smote?

606
00:44:28,168 --> 00:44:29,169
Smotten?

607
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:32,840
Listen, that thing doesn't give you
power to create life...

608
00:44:33,006 --> 00:44:34,716
it's a homing beacon of death.

609
00:44:34,883 --> 00:44:37,177
If you don't put it away,
bad things are gonna come for it.

610
00:44:37,594 --> 00:44:39,346
Come for this? The heart?

611
00:44:39,721 --> 00:44:40,597
You mean this heart right here?

612
00:44:40,681 --> 00:44:42,182
Don't, you can't
raise your voice like that!

613
00:44:42,266 --> 00:44:43,058
Come and get it!

614
00:44:43,433 --> 00:44:44,685
You are gonna get us killed!

615
00:44:45,102 --> 00:44:48,272
No, I'm gonna get us to Te Fiti,
so you can put it back.

616
00:44:48,438 --> 00:44:49,439
Thank you.

617
00:44:49,606 --> 00:44:50,774
You're welcome.

618
00:44:55,696 --> 00:44:56,780
Kakamora.

619
00:44:56,947 --> 00:44:58,198
Kaka-what?

620
00:44:58,365 --> 00:44:59,783
Murdering little pirates.

621
00:45:00,742 --> 00:45:03,370
Wonder what they're here for.

622
00:45:07,958 --> 00:45:10,127
They're kinda cute.

623
00:45:27,853 --> 00:45:28,687
Ocean!

624
00:45:29,021 --> 00:45:30,689
Do something! Help us!

625
00:45:31,148 --> 00:45:33,400
The ocean doesn't help you,
you help yourself!

626
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,985
Tighten the halyard. Bind the stays!

627
00:45:36,987 --> 00:45:37,988
You can't sail?

628
00:45:39,865 --> 00:45:41,408
I am self-taught.

629
00:45:52,878 --> 00:45:55,005
Can't you shapeshift or something?

630
00:45:55,172 --> 00:45:56,048
Do you see my hook?

631
00:45:56,381 --> 00:45:58,050
No magic hook, no magic powers!

632
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,869
Their boat is turning into more boats!

633
00:46:45,389 --> 00:46:47,850
Yep, I just did that.

634
00:46:53,522 --> 00:46:54,690
No, no!

635
00:46:56,108 --> 00:46:56,859
Heihei!

636
00:47:10,998 --> 00:47:12,082
Maui!

637
00:47:12,416 --> 00:47:13,333
They took the heart!

638
00:47:15,836 --> 00:47:16,628
That's a chicken.

639
00:47:17,004 --> 00:47:18,213
The heart is in the...

640
00:47:19,173 --> 00:47:20,924
We have to get him back!

641
00:47:25,762 --> 00:47:27,014
Maui!

642
00:47:27,681 --> 00:47:29,308
Cheeeehoooo!

643
00:47:41,361 --> 00:47:43,030
There! Right there!

644
00:47:43,197 --> 00:47:43,947
You're turning?

645
00:47:44,364 --> 00:47:45,199
What are you doing?

646
00:47:45,657 --> 00:47:46,783
Escaping!

647
00:47:47,242 --> 00:47:48,118
The heart!

648
00:47:48,493 --> 00:47:50,078
Forget it! You'll never get it back!

649
00:47:50,245 --> 00:47:52,039
Besides, you got a better one.

650
00:47:52,122 --> 00:47:52,956
Hey!

651
00:47:53,415 --> 00:47:55,125
What am I gonna steer with?

652
00:47:55,709 --> 00:47:57,252
They're just gonna kill ya!

653
00:48:01,632 --> 00:48:02,716
Coconuts.

654
00:48:45,592 --> 00:48:46,802
Got it!

655
00:48:50,722 --> 00:48:51,557
Hey!

656
00:49:07,573 --> 00:49:08,574
Yeah!

657
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:10,534
We did it!

658
00:49:12,202 --> 00:49:14,079
Congratulations
on not being dead, girlie.

659
00:49:14,496 --> 00:49:15,664
You surprise me.

660
00:49:16,123 --> 00:49:18,208
But I'm still not taking
that thing back.

661
00:49:19,835 --> 00:49:22,546
You wanna get to Te Fiti you gotta
go through a whole ocean of bad.

662
00:49:23,046 --> 00:49:23,964
Not to mention Te Kā.

663
00:49:25,674 --> 00:49:27,009
Lava monster?

664
00:49:27,509 --> 00:49:29,094
Ever defeat a lava monster?

665
00:49:29,887 --> 00:49:32,055
No. Have you?

666
00:49:39,688 --> 00:49:42,816
I'm not going on a suicide mission
with some mortal.

667
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:46,195
You can't restore the heart
without me...

668
00:49:46,361 --> 00:49:48,113
and me says no.

669
00:49:49,072 --> 00:49:50,407
I'm getting my hook.

670
00:49:51,575 --> 00:49:52,576
End of discussion.

671
00:49:59,583 --> 00:50:01,585
You'd be a hero.

672
00:50:03,879 --> 00:50:05,964
That's what you're all about, right?

673
00:50:06,131 --> 00:50:08,967
Little girl, I am a hero.

674
00:50:09,134 --> 00:50:10,594
Maybe you were.

675
00:50:10,761 --> 00:50:11,887
But now...

676
00:50:12,054 --> 00:50:14,973
now you're just the guy
who stole the heart of Te Fiti.

677
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:17,434
The guy who cursed the world.

678
00:50:18,852 --> 00:50:19,895
You're no one's hero.

679
00:50:20,771 --> 00:50:21,480
No one?

680
00:50:31,448 --> 00:50:32,157
But...

681
00:50:32,824 --> 00:50:34,201
put this back...

682
00:50:34,618 --> 00:50:36,203
save the world...

683
00:50:36,578 --> 00:50:38,372
you'd be everyone's hero.

684
00:50:43,168 --> 00:50:46,296
Maui! Maui! Maui!

685
00:50:46,964 --> 00:50:48,590
You're so amazing!

686
00:50:49,216 --> 00:50:51,927
We'd never make it without my hook.
Not past Te Kā.

687
00:50:52,094 --> 00:50:53,220
Then we get your hook.

688
00:50:53,595 --> 00:50:57,057
We get your hook, take out Te Kā,
restore the heart.

689
00:50:57,224 --> 00:50:59,852
Unless you don't wanna be...

690
00:51:00,018 --> 00:51:03,146
Maui, demigod of the wind and sea.

691
00:51:03,313 --> 00:51:04,731
Hero to...

692
00:51:05,232 --> 00:51:06,400
all.

693
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:11,572
First, we get my hook.

694
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:13,365
Then save the world.

695
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:14,575
Deal?

696
00:51:14,658 --> 00:51:15,492
Deal.

697
00:51:20,247 --> 00:51:21,039
Worth a shot.

698
00:51:22,249 --> 00:51:24,626
Okay, we go east.

699
00:51:25,043 --> 00:51:26,170
To the lair of Tamatoa.

700
00:51:28,338 --> 00:51:31,842
If anyone has my hook,
it's that beady-eyed bottom-feeder.

701
00:51:44,354 --> 00:51:45,731
Teach me to sail.

702
00:51:48,192 --> 00:51:51,403
My job is to deliver Maui
across the great ocean.

703
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:52,571
I should...

704
00:51:53,947 --> 00:51:55,866
I should be sailing.

705
00:51:56,241 --> 00:51:58,035
It's called wayfinding, princess.

706
00:51:58,702 --> 00:52:00,579
And it's not just sails and knots...

707
00:52:00,954 --> 00:52:03,332
it's seeing where you're going
in your mind.

708
00:52:03,749 --> 00:52:05,584
Knowing where you are...

709
00:52:05,959 --> 00:52:07,169
by knowing where you've been.

710
00:52:07,544 --> 00:52:09,838
Okay, first, I'm not a princess.

711
00:52:10,422 --> 00:52:11,465
I am the daughter of the chief.

712
00:52:11,632 --> 00:52:12,799
-Same difference.
-No.

713
00:52:12,966 --> 00:52:15,594
If you wear a dress,
and you have an animal sidekick...

714
00:52:15,761 --> 00:52:16,803
you're a princess.

715
00:52:17,262 --> 00:52:18,263
You are not a wayfinder.

716
00:52:18,597 --> 00:52:21,850
You will never be a wayfinder,
you will never be a...

717
00:52:27,189 --> 00:52:29,399
Really? Blow dart in my butt cheek?

718
00:52:34,863 --> 00:52:37,533
You are a bad person.

719
00:52:37,908 --> 00:52:39,409
If you can talk, you can teach.

720
00:52:39,576 --> 00:52:40,577
Wayfinding.

721
00:52:41,828 --> 00:52:43,539
Lesson one. Hit it.

722
00:52:46,208 --> 00:52:47,292
Pull the sheet.

723
00:52:48,168 --> 00:52:49,795
Not the sheet.

724
00:52:49,878 --> 00:52:50,754
No.

725
00:52:50,838 --> 00:52:51,588
Nope.

726
00:52:52,214 --> 00:52:54,091
Nope. No.

727
00:52:55,217 --> 00:52:56,802
Tried that one already.

728
00:53:00,305 --> 00:53:04,101
You're measuring the stars,
not giving the sky a high-five.

729
00:53:05,477 --> 00:53:08,355
If the current's warm,
you're going the right way.

730
00:53:10,274 --> 00:53:11,775
It's cold.

731
00:53:11,942 --> 00:53:13,944
Wait, it's getting warmer.

732
00:53:15,571 --> 00:53:18,699
That is disgusting!
What is wrong with you?

733
00:53:35,424 --> 00:53:36,633
We're here?

734
00:53:37,467 --> 00:53:39,803
See, told you I could do it!

735
00:53:48,312 --> 00:53:49,563
Motunui?

736
00:53:50,772 --> 00:53:52,357
I'm home?

737
00:53:55,986 --> 00:53:57,654
-Moana!
-Dad?

738
00:53:58,488 --> 00:54:00,073
Moana!

739
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:01,408
Mom?

740
00:54:02,868 --> 00:54:04,036
Help!

741
00:54:05,954 --> 00:54:06,663
No!

742
00:54:07,456 --> 00:54:08,582
Moana!

743
00:54:11,418 --> 00:54:13,128
Enjoy your beauty rest?

744
00:54:13,504 --> 00:54:16,006
You know,
a real wayfinder never sleeps...

745
00:54:16,173 --> 00:54:18,800
so they actually get
where they need to go.

746
00:54:19,468 --> 00:54:20,719
Muscle up, buttercup.

747
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:22,971
We're here.

748
00:54:24,473 --> 00:54:26,600
You're sure this guy's gonna
have your hook?

749
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:29,019
Tamatoa? Oh, he'll have it.

750
00:54:29,478 --> 00:54:33,232
He's a scavenger. Collects stuff.
Thinks it makes him look cool.

751
00:54:35,192 --> 00:54:36,944
And for Tamatoa, trust me...

752
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:39,655
my hook is the coolest collectible.

753
00:54:40,113 --> 00:54:42,533
And he lives up there?

754
00:54:44,743 --> 00:54:45,452
No, no, no.

755
00:54:45,911 --> 00:54:47,329
That's just the entrance...

756
00:54:47,496 --> 00:54:49,706
to Lalotai.

757
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:50,874
Lalotai?

758
00:54:51,291 --> 00:54:53,043
Realm of monsters?

759
00:54:53,669 --> 00:54:55,546
We're going to the realm of monsters?

760
00:54:56,004 --> 00:54:58,215
We? No. Me.

761
00:54:58,674 --> 00:55:01,176
You are gonna stay here
with the other chicken.

762
00:55:03,512 --> 00:55:05,180
That's what I'm talking about.
Gimme some.

763
00:55:06,431 --> 00:55:08,851
Come on. That was a good one.
How do you not get it?

764
00:55:09,017 --> 00:55:11,186
I called her a chicken,
there's a chicken on the boat.

765
00:55:11,562 --> 00:55:13,063
I know she's human,
but that's not the...

766
00:55:13,230 --> 00:55:14,773
You know what? Forget it. Forget it!

767
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:16,400
I'm not explaining it to you.

768
00:55:16,567 --> 00:55:18,151
'Cause then it's not funny.

769
00:55:31,957 --> 00:55:34,042
So, daughter of the chief...

770
00:55:34,209 --> 00:55:35,669
I thought you stayed in the village.

771
00:55:35,836 --> 00:55:37,421
You know, kissing babies and things.

772
00:55:38,547 --> 00:55:40,549
Hey, I'm just trying to understand...

773
00:55:40,632 --> 00:55:43,051
why your people decided to send...

774
00:55:43,218 --> 00:55:45,137
How do I phrase this? You.

775
00:55:45,512 --> 00:55:48,724
My people didn't send me.

776
00:55:48,891 --> 00:55:50,058
The ocean did.

777
00:55:50,225 --> 00:55:51,435
The ocean?

778
00:55:51,602 --> 00:55:52,603
Makes sense.

779
00:55:52,686 --> 00:55:54,438
You're what, eight? Can't sail.

780
00:55:54,521 --> 00:55:55,439
Obvious choice.

781
00:55:55,898 --> 00:55:59,276
It chose me for a reason.

782
00:55:59,443 --> 00:56:01,028
If the ocean's so smart...

783
00:56:01,195 --> 00:56:04,281
why didn't it just take the heart
back to Te Fiti itself?

784
00:56:04,448 --> 00:56:06,033
Or bring me my hook?

785
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:08,577
The ocean's straight up kooky-dooks.

786
00:56:09,745 --> 00:56:11,538
But I'm sure it's not wrong about you.

787
00:56:12,289 --> 00:56:14,583
You're the Chosen One!

788
00:56:30,307 --> 00:56:33,560
The ocean chose you for a reason.

789
00:56:33,727 --> 00:56:36,230
If you start singing,
I'm gonna throw up.

790
00:56:37,064 --> 00:56:39,149
So, not seeing an entrance.

791
00:56:39,525 --> 00:56:41,485
Yes, because it only appears...

792
00:56:41,652 --> 00:56:43,487
after a human sacrifice.

793
00:56:45,531 --> 00:56:46,865
Kidding.

794
00:56:47,032 --> 00:56:48,283
So serious.

795
00:57:11,974 --> 00:57:12,850
Don't worry...

796
00:57:13,267 --> 00:57:15,269
it's a lot farther down than it looks.

797
00:57:15,686 --> 00:57:17,354
Cheeeehoooo!

798
00:57:21,859 --> 00:57:24,736
I am still falling!

799
00:57:26,864 --> 00:57:28,115
You can do this.

800
00:57:28,949 --> 00:57:29,867
Go!

801
00:57:51,054 --> 00:57:53,599
And he sticks the landing.

802
00:57:55,976 --> 00:57:58,270
What? Dum-dum, she's not even here.

803
00:57:58,437 --> 00:58:00,731
No mortal's gonna jump
into the realm of...

804
00:58:01,064 --> 00:58:01,857
Huh?

805
00:58:06,236 --> 00:58:08,155
Well, she's dead.

806
00:58:08,989 --> 00:58:10,866
Okay, let's get my hook.

807
00:59:11,885 --> 00:59:13,971
Maui's fishhook!

808
00:59:14,137 --> 00:59:15,138
Yeah!

809
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:17,391
Sorry!

810
00:59:17,558 --> 00:59:18,433
I thought you were a monster...

811
00:59:18,809 --> 00:59:19,977
But I found your hook.

812
00:59:20,143 --> 00:59:22,271
And, you're right, this Tamatoa guy
really likes his treasure.

813
00:59:22,437 --> 00:59:23,438
Stay.

814
00:59:23,605 --> 00:59:25,816
What? No.
I'm the one who found...

815
00:59:26,191 --> 00:59:27,484
Listen. For a thousand years...

816
00:59:27,651 --> 00:59:29,862
I've only been thinking of
keeping this hair silky...

817
00:59:30,028 --> 00:59:31,071
getting my hook...

818
00:59:31,238 --> 00:59:32,823
and being awesome again.

819
00:59:32,990 --> 00:59:35,200
And it's not getting screwed up
by a mortal...

820
00:59:35,659 --> 00:59:39,246
who has no business
inside of a monster cave, except...

821
00:59:41,123 --> 00:59:42,499
Except...

822
00:59:42,666 --> 00:59:43,709
maybe as bait.

823
00:59:44,084 --> 00:59:45,043
Huh?

824
00:59:45,836 --> 00:59:47,004
Wow!

825
00:59:47,171 --> 00:59:49,214
The shiny, glittery cave.

826
00:59:49,381 --> 00:59:50,674
And just like me...

827
00:59:51,049 --> 00:59:53,427
it is covered in sparkly treasure.

828
00:59:53,844 --> 00:59:55,554
Sparkle, sparkle, sparkle.

829
00:59:55,721 --> 00:59:57,014
You're not selling it!

830
00:59:57,347 --> 00:59:59,183
This is stupid!
I'm just gonna walk up and get it!

831
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:02,603
You go up there, he will kill you.
Just stick to the plan.

832
01:00:04,313 --> 01:00:06,398
When he shows up,
keep him distracted.

833
01:00:06,565 --> 01:00:08,066
Make him talk about himself.

834
01:00:08,233 --> 01:00:10,194
He loves bragging about
how great he is.

835
01:00:10,527 --> 01:00:12,029
You two must get along swell.

836
01:00:12,613 --> 01:00:13,989
No, not since I ripped off his leg.

837
01:00:14,865 --> 01:00:16,325
You ripped off his...

838
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:17,534
Maui?

839
01:00:27,377 --> 01:00:28,545
What have we here?

840
01:00:29,838 --> 01:00:33,217
It's a sparkly, shiny... Wait a minute.

841
01:00:35,844 --> 01:00:36,720
It's a human!

842
01:00:36,887 --> 01:00:40,474
What are you doing down here,
in the realm of the...

843
01:00:40,891 --> 01:00:42,142
Just pick an eye, babe.

844
01:00:42,309 --> 01:00:44,520
I can't concentrate
on what I'm saying if you keep...

845
01:00:44,603 --> 01:00:46,146
Yeah, pick one, pick one!

846
01:00:46,897 --> 01:00:48,982
You're a funny-looking little thing,
aren't you?

847
01:00:49,066 --> 01:00:50,442
Don't! That's my gramma's!

848
01:00:50,817 --> 01:00:51,735
"That's my gramma's!"

849
01:00:51,902 --> 01:00:52,986
I ate my gramma!

850
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:55,614
And it took a week,
'cause she was absolutely humongous.

851
01:00:55,781 --> 01:00:57,199
Why are you here?

852
01:00:58,617 --> 01:00:59,952
'Cause you're amazing!

853
01:01:00,410 --> 01:01:05,541
And we mortals have heard of the tale
of the crab who became a legend!

854
01:01:05,916 --> 01:01:08,043
And I just had to know...

855
01:01:08,627 --> 01:01:10,754
how you became so...

856
01:01:11,338 --> 01:01:13,632
crabulous?

857
01:01:14,591 --> 01:01:19,179
Are you just trying to get me
to talk about myself?

858
01:01:19,763 --> 01:01:21,306
Because if you are...

859
01:01:21,473 --> 01:01:23,475
I will gladly do so.

860
01:01:23,809 --> 01:01:24,393
Huh?

861
01:01:24,768 --> 01:01:25,936
In song form!

862
01:01:28,605 --> 01:01:31,942
Well, Tamatoa
hasn't always been this glam

863
01:01:32,109 --> 01:01:35,237
I was a drab little crab once

864
01:01:35,988 --> 01:01:38,240
Now I know I can be happy as a clam

865
01:01:38,782 --> 01:01:40,784
Because I'm beautiful, baby

866
01:01:42,286 --> 01:01:43,120
And did your granny say

867
01:01:43,453 --> 01:01:44,997
Listen to your heart

868
01:01:45,414 --> 01:01:48,125
Be who you are on the inside

869
01:01:48,292 --> 01:01:51,545
I need three words
To tear her argument apart

870
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:52,963
Your granny lied

871
01:01:53,297 --> 01:01:55,007
I'd rather be shiny

872
01:01:55,174 --> 01:01:58,051
Like a treasure
From a sunken pirate wreck

873
01:01:58,218 --> 01:02:01,471
Scrub the deck
And make it look shiny

874
01:02:01,930 --> 01:02:04,683
I will sparkle like a
Wealthy woman's neck

875
01:02:05,309 --> 01:02:07,227
Just a sec
Don't ya know

876
01:02:07,603 --> 01:02:11,231
Fish are dumb, dumb, dumb
They chase anything that glitters

877
01:02:11,815 --> 01:02:13,025
Beginners

878
01:02:13,317 --> 01:02:15,652
Oh, and here they come, come, come

879
01:02:15,819 --> 01:02:18,071
To the brightest thing that glitters

880
01:02:18,155 --> 01:02:19,114
Mm, fish dinners

881
01:02:19,198 --> 01:02:21,366
I just love free food

882
01:02:22,159 --> 01:02:25,037
And you look like seafood

883
01:02:26,413 --> 01:02:28,207
Hey, crab cake!

884
01:02:32,169 --> 01:02:33,545
I'm back.

885
01:02:34,838 --> 01:02:36,924
It's Maui Time!

886
01:02:39,885 --> 01:02:40,969
What do you say, little buddy?

887
01:02:42,012 --> 01:02:43,722
Giant hawk? Coming up!

888
01:02:43,889 --> 01:02:45,265
Cheeeehoooo!

889
01:02:48,185 --> 01:02:51,271
Cheeeehoooo!

890
01:02:55,734 --> 01:02:57,569
Well, well, well.

891
01:02:57,736 --> 01:03:00,822
Little Maui's having
trouble with his look

892
01:03:00,906 --> 01:03:03,033
Ya little semi-demi-mini-god

893
01:03:03,534 --> 01:03:05,786
Ouch
What a terrible performance

894
01:03:05,953 --> 01:03:07,371
Get the hook
Get it?

895
01:03:07,538 --> 01:03:10,249
You don't swing it
Like you used to, man

896
01:03:10,916 --> 01:03:13,877
Yet I have to give you
Credit for my start

897
01:03:14,044 --> 01:03:17,047
And your tattoos on the outside

898
01:03:17,464 --> 01:03:20,467
For just like you
I made myself a work of art

899
01:03:20,801 --> 01:03:22,636
I'll never hide
I can't

900
01:03:22,970 --> 01:03:23,929
I'm too shiny

901
01:03:24,096 --> 01:03:27,057
Watch me dazzle
Like a diamond in the rough

902
01:03:27,224 --> 01:03:30,561
Strut my stuff
My stuff is so shiny

903
01:03:30,769 --> 01:03:33,188
Send your armies
But they'll never be enough

904
01:03:33,564 --> 01:03:36,817
My shell's too tough
Maui, man

905
01:03:37,234 --> 01:03:40,320
You can try, try, try
But you can't expect a demigod

906
01:03:40,404 --> 01:03:42,614
To beat a decapod
Look it up

907
01:03:43,031 --> 01:03:44,575
You will die, die, die

908
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:46,618
Now it's time for me to take apart

909
01:03:47,286 --> 01:03:49,037
Your achin' heart

910
01:03:49,413 --> 01:03:54,501
Far from the ones who abandoned you

911
01:03:54,585 --> 01:03:58,672
Chasing the love of these humans

912
01:03:58,755 --> 01:04:01,842
Who made you feel wanted

913
01:04:02,176 --> 01:04:04,595
You tried to be tough

914
01:04:04,761 --> 01:04:08,891
But your armor's just not hard enough

915
01:04:09,516 --> 01:04:13,520
Maui
Now it's time to kick your heinie

916
01:04:13,604 --> 01:04:16,607
Ever seen someone so shiny

917
01:04:16,982 --> 01:04:19,818
Soak it in
'Cause it's the last you'll ever see

918
01:04:20,194 --> 01:04:21,486
C'est la vie
Mon ami

919
01:04:21,904 --> 01:04:23,197
I'm so shiny

920
01:04:23,614 --> 01:04:26,283
Now I eat you so
prepare your final plea

921
01:04:26,450 --> 01:04:27,492
Just for me

922
01:04:28,994 --> 01:04:31,246
You'll never be quite as shiny

923
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:35,459
You wish you were nice and shiny

924
01:04:38,337 --> 01:04:39,505
-Hey!
-Huh?

925
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:41,965
I got something shiny for ya!

926
01:04:44,134 --> 01:04:46,470
The heart of Te Fiti.

927
01:04:46,637 --> 01:04:48,889
You can't run from me!

928
01:04:49,306 --> 01:04:51,725
Oh, you can.
You keep surprising me.

929
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:56,563
There's only so far you can get
on those two little legs.

930
01:05:00,984 --> 01:05:02,653
The power of creation...

931
01:05:03,028 --> 01:05:04,363
for a crustacean.

932
01:05:04,571 --> 01:05:06,031
Where is it? Where is it?

933
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:08,325
We gotta go!

934
01:05:08,992 --> 01:05:09,993
What about the heart?

935
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,663
He can have it.
I've got a better one.

936
01:05:13,997 --> 01:05:15,332
Yes, I have the...

937
01:05:15,499 --> 01:05:16,500
Wait a minute.

938
01:05:16,917 --> 01:05:19,503
I see, she's taken a barnacle
and she's covered it in...

939
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:22,840
bioluminescent algae as a diversion.

940
01:05:25,342 --> 01:05:26,176
Come back here!

941
01:05:30,597 --> 01:05:33,016
Cheeeehoooo!

942
01:05:33,892 --> 01:05:35,060
Hey!

943
01:05:35,227 --> 01:05:36,854
Did you like the song?

944
01:05:44,361 --> 01:05:45,737
We're alive!

945
01:05:45,904 --> 01:05:46,905
We're alive!

946
01:05:48,866 --> 01:05:49,867
Listen...

947
01:05:50,033 --> 01:05:53,120
-I appreciate what you did down there.
-Mm-hmm.

948
01:05:53,495 --> 01:05:54,246
-Took guts.
-Mm-hmm.

949
01:05:54,621 --> 01:05:55,706
-But...
-Mm-hmm.

950
01:05:56,039 --> 01:05:56,915
I'm sorry.

951
01:05:57,082 --> 01:06:00,127
I'm trying to be sincere for once,
and it feels like you're distracted.

952
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:02,212
No, no. No way!

953
01:06:02,337 --> 01:06:04,631
Really? Because you're looking at me
like I have a...

954
01:06:07,593 --> 01:06:08,635
shark head.

955
01:06:09,052 --> 01:06:11,972
What? Do you have a shark head?

956
01:06:12,347 --> 01:06:13,891
Look, the point is...

957
01:06:14,057 --> 01:06:16,977
for a little girl, child, thing,
whatever...

958
01:06:17,144 --> 01:06:19,646
who had no business
being down there...

959
01:06:20,063 --> 01:06:21,565
you did me a solid.

960
01:06:21,732 --> 01:06:23,859
But you also almost died.

961
01:06:24,526 --> 01:06:26,153
And I couldn't even beat
that dumb crab.

962
01:06:26,236 --> 01:06:28,405
So, chances of beating Te Kā?

963
01:06:28,572 --> 01:06:29,740
Bupkis.

964
01:06:29,907 --> 01:06:33,118
We're never making it to Te Fiti.
This mission is cursed.

965
01:06:33,535 --> 01:06:34,578
It's not cursed.

966
01:06:35,287 --> 01:06:36,121
Shark head.

967
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:39,166
It is not cursed.

968
01:06:53,347 --> 01:06:54,264
Cursed.

969
01:06:58,435 --> 01:07:00,604
What can I say except

970
01:07:00,771 --> 01:07:02,606
We're dead soon

971
01:07:02,814 --> 01:07:04,316
We're dead soon

972
01:07:05,317 --> 01:07:07,236
Can you at least try?

973
01:07:09,780 --> 01:07:11,657
Giant hawk.

974
01:07:14,451 --> 01:07:17,538
Hey, it's okay, it's okay
We're dead soon

975
01:07:17,621 --> 01:07:19,206
All right, break time's over.

976
01:07:19,623 --> 01:07:20,541
Get up.

977
01:07:20,707 --> 01:07:23,043
Why? Are you gonna
give me a speech?

978
01:07:23,210 --> 01:07:26,964
Tell me I can beat Te Kā
'cause I'm "Maui?"

979
01:07:28,715 --> 01:07:29,800
Take a hike, Tiny.

980
01:07:35,806 --> 01:07:38,308
How do you get your tattoos?

981
01:07:38,684 --> 01:07:40,978
They show up. When I earn them.

982
01:07:41,812 --> 01:07:44,731
How'd you earn that one?
What's that for?

983
01:07:44,898 --> 01:07:48,151
That's man's discovery of Nunya.

984
01:07:48,527 --> 01:07:49,403
What's Nunya?

985
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:50,988
Nunya business.

986
01:07:52,656 --> 01:07:53,824
I'll just keep asking.

987
01:07:56,201 --> 01:07:57,035
What's it for?

988
01:07:57,911 --> 01:07:59,997
You need to stop doing that.

989
01:08:04,751 --> 01:08:06,170
-Back off.
-Just tell me what it is.

990
01:08:06,628 --> 01:08:08,005
I said back off.

991
01:08:08,172 --> 01:08:09,840
Is it why your hook's not working?

992
01:08:25,856 --> 01:08:28,649
You don't wanna talk, don't talk.

993
01:08:29,109 --> 01:08:31,069
You wanna throw me off the boat...

994
01:08:31,528 --> 01:08:33,113
throw me off.

995
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:36,617
You wanna tell me
I don't know what I'm doing...

996
01:08:37,117 --> 01:08:38,743
I know I don't.

997
01:08:39,703 --> 01:08:42,872
I have no idea
why the ocean chose me.

998
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:44,750
You're right.

999
01:08:45,375 --> 01:08:49,379
But my island is dying...

1000
01:08:50,214 --> 01:08:53,300
so I am here.

1001
01:08:53,884 --> 01:08:56,261
It's just me and you.

1002
01:08:56,428 --> 01:08:59,096
And I want to help...

1003
01:08:59,264 --> 01:09:03,519
but I can't if you don't let me.

1004
01:09:08,941 --> 01:09:11,443
I wasn't born a demigod.

1005
01:09:12,152 --> 01:09:14,279
I had human parents.

1006
01:09:16,657 --> 01:09:20,618
They took one look and decided...

1007
01:09:20,786 --> 01:09:23,162
they did not want me.

1008
01:09:23,705 --> 01:09:25,791
They threw me into the sea...

1009
01:09:26,250 --> 01:09:29,294
like I was nothing.

1010
01:09:30,837 --> 01:09:34,258
Somehow, I was found by the gods.

1011
01:09:34,633 --> 01:09:36,093
They gave me the hook.

1012
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:37,970
They made me...

1013
01:09:38,761 --> 01:09:39,763
Maui.

1014
01:09:41,139 --> 01:09:43,892
And back to the humans I went.

1015
01:09:44,268 --> 01:09:48,145
I gave them islands, fire, coconuts.

1016
01:09:49,147 --> 01:09:51,358
Anything they could ever want.

1017
01:09:52,149 --> 01:09:54,444
You took the heart for them.

1018
01:09:55,153 --> 01:09:58,031
You did everything for them.

1019
01:09:58,866 --> 01:10:00,659
So they'd love you.

1020
01:10:01,285 --> 01:10:04,413
It was never enough.

1021
01:10:12,546 --> 01:10:15,883
Maybe the gods found you for a reason.

1022
01:10:16,049 --> 01:10:19,219
Maybe the ocean brought you to them...

1023
01:10:19,386 --> 01:10:23,473
because it saw someone
who was worthy of being saved.

1024
01:10:24,725 --> 01:10:28,312
But the gods aren't the ones
who make you Maui.

1025
01:10:29,021 --> 01:10:30,230
You are.

1026
01:10:39,698 --> 01:10:41,533
Okay, okay.

1027
01:10:42,492 --> 01:10:44,995
I love you, too, buddy.

1028
01:11:34,837 --> 01:11:36,088
Cheeeehoooo!

1029
01:11:51,144 --> 01:11:51,812
Yeah!

1030
01:12:16,170 --> 01:12:18,797
Next stop, Te Fiti.

1031
01:13:05,636 --> 01:13:06,428
What?

1032
01:13:06,803 --> 01:13:08,305
I figured it out.

1033
01:13:09,640 --> 01:13:13,352
You know, the ocean used to love
when I pulled up islands...

1034
01:13:13,519 --> 01:13:17,314
'cause your ancestors
would sail her seas and find 'em.

1035
01:13:18,023 --> 01:13:20,943
All those new lands, new villages.

1036
01:13:21,318 --> 01:13:23,737
It was the water that connected 'em all.

1037
01:13:24,154 --> 01:13:25,822
And if I were the ocean...

1038
01:13:25,989 --> 01:13:30,035
I think I'd be looking for
a curly-haired non-princess...

1039
01:13:30,827 --> 01:13:32,663
to start that again.

1040
01:13:32,829 --> 01:13:37,209
That is literally the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

1041
01:13:38,252 --> 01:13:40,379
Probably should have saved it
for Te Fiti.

1042
01:13:42,005 --> 01:13:43,090
I did.

1043
01:13:45,926 --> 01:13:48,053
Moana of Motunui...

1044
01:13:48,470 --> 01:13:53,934
I believe you have officially
delivered Maui across the great sea.

1045
01:13:55,060 --> 01:13:57,521
Moana! Moana! Moana!

1046
01:13:58,021 --> 01:13:59,731
You're so amazing!

1047
01:14:01,567 --> 01:14:02,526
It's time.

1048
01:14:20,878 --> 01:14:22,379
Go save the world.

1049
01:14:23,839 --> 01:14:25,674
Cheeeehoooo!

1050
01:14:46,153 --> 01:14:47,321
Maui!

1051
01:15:21,813 --> 01:15:23,023
What are you doing?

1052
01:15:23,357 --> 01:15:24,983
Finding you a better way in!

1053
01:15:26,652 --> 01:15:28,362
-We won't make it!
-Yes, we will!

1054
01:15:28,737 --> 01:15:29,655
-Turn around!
-No!

1055
01:15:29,821 --> 01:15:30,948
Moana, stop!

1056
01:15:31,114 --> 01:15:31,949
No!

1057
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:01,812
Are you okay?

1058
01:16:03,355 --> 01:16:04,356
Maui?

1059
01:16:12,197 --> 01:16:14,074
I told you to turn back.

1060
01:16:16,410 --> 01:16:18,078
I thought we could make it.

1061
01:16:18,495 --> 01:16:19,413
We?

1062
01:16:21,039 --> 01:16:23,125
I thought I could make it.

1063
01:16:25,002 --> 01:16:26,211
We can fix it.

1064
01:16:26,378 --> 01:16:28,505
It was made by the gods.

1065
01:16:28,672 --> 01:16:30,382
You can't fix it!

1066
01:16:30,841 --> 01:16:32,885
Next time we'll be more careful.

1067
01:16:33,302 --> 01:16:35,262
Te Kā was stuck on the barrier islands.

1068
01:16:35,429 --> 01:16:37,848
It's lava, it can't go in the water.

1069
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:40,017
We can find a way around.

1070
01:16:40,184 --> 01:16:42,019
I'm not going back.

1071
01:16:43,228 --> 01:16:44,688
We still have to restore the heart.

1072
01:16:45,063 --> 01:16:46,398
My hook is cracked.

1073
01:16:46,565 --> 01:16:48,192
One more hit, and it's over.

1074
01:16:48,609 --> 01:16:50,444
Maui, you have to restore the heart.

1075
01:16:50,861 --> 01:16:52,529
Without my hook, I am nothing.

1076
01:16:52,696 --> 01:16:53,864
That's not true!

1077
01:16:54,031 --> 01:16:56,491
Without my hook, I am nothing!

1078
01:17:06,084 --> 01:17:07,336
We are only here...

1079
01:17:07,753 --> 01:17:10,631
because you stole the heart
in the first place.

1080
01:17:11,924 --> 01:17:14,551
No, we're here because
the ocean told you you're special...

1081
01:17:14,718 --> 01:17:16,553
and you believed it.

1082
01:17:17,763 --> 01:17:20,265
I am Moana of Motunui.

1083
01:17:20,432 --> 01:17:22,643
-You will board my boat...
-Goodbye, Moana.

1084
01:17:23,018 --> 01:17:23,894
...sail across the sea...

1085
01:17:24,394 --> 01:17:25,229
I'm not killing myself...

1086
01:17:25,395 --> 01:17:26,647
so you can prove
you're something you're not!

1087
01:17:26,813 --> 01:17:28,106
...and restore the heart of Te Fiti!

1088
01:17:28,774 --> 01:17:31,151
The ocean chose me!

1089
01:17:32,110 --> 01:17:33,820
It chose wrong.

1090
01:17:43,539 --> 01:17:44,623
Maui!

1091
01:17:59,596 --> 01:18:02,099
Why did you bring me here?

1092
01:18:06,937 --> 01:18:08,981
I'm not the right person.

1093
01:18:11,775 --> 01:18:14,611
You have to choose someone else.

1094
01:18:16,947 --> 01:18:19,491
Choose someone else.

1095
01:18:20,284 --> 01:18:21,618
Please.

1096
01:18:40,721 --> 01:18:41,972
No.

1097
01:18:57,863 --> 01:19:00,157
You're a long ways past the reef.

1098
01:19:01,533 --> 01:19:02,534
Gramma?

1099
01:19:04,578 --> 01:19:07,539
Guess I chose the right tattoo.

1100
01:19:08,123 --> 01:19:09,583
Gramma!

1101
01:19:14,630 --> 01:19:16,715
I tried, Gramma.

1102
01:19:18,634 --> 01:19:20,344
I couldn't do it.

1103
01:19:21,094 --> 01:19:23,597
It's not your fault.

1104
01:19:23,764 --> 01:19:27,518
I never should have put so much
on your shoulders.

1105
01:19:28,352 --> 01:19:30,395
If you are ready to go home...

1106
01:19:31,855 --> 01:19:33,857
I will be with you.

1107
01:19:50,415 --> 01:19:52,084
Why do you hesitate?

1108
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:55,128
I don't know.

1109
01:19:58,715 --> 01:20:01,093
I know a girl from an island

1110
01:20:02,094 --> 01:20:04,763
She stands apart from the crowd

1111
01:20:05,222 --> 01:20:08,225
She loves the sea and her people

1112
01:20:08,725 --> 01:20:10,894
She makes her whole family proud

1113
01:20:12,062 --> 01:20:14,731
Sometimes the world
seems against you

1114
01:20:15,482 --> 01:20:18,277
The journey may leave a scar

1115
01:20:18,443 --> 01:20:21,238
But scars can heal and reveal just

1116
01:20:21,405 --> 01:20:23,991
Where you are

1117
01:20:24,950 --> 01:20:27,911
The people you love will change you

1118
01:20:28,287 --> 01:20:31,164
The things you have
learned will guide you

1119
01:20:31,415 --> 01:20:34,751
And nothing on earth can silence

1120
01:20:34,918 --> 01:20:38,046
The quiet voice still inside you

1121
01:20:38,463 --> 01:20:41,592
And when that voice starts to whisper

1122
01:20:41,758 --> 01:20:44,428
Moana, you've come so far

1123
01:20:45,179 --> 01:20:46,930
Moana, listen

1124
01:20:47,097 --> 01:20:51,768
Do you know who you are?

1125
01:20:54,021 --> 01:20:55,439
Who am I?

1126
01:20:57,482 --> 01:21:00,944
I am a girl who loves my island

1127
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:04,865
And the girl who loves the sea

1128
01:21:05,282 --> 01:21:08,327
It calls me

1129
01:21:10,454 --> 01:21:13,332
I am the daughter of the village chief

1130
01:21:13,874 --> 01:21:16,793
We are descended from voyagers

1131
01:21:17,211 --> 01:21:19,546
Who found their way across the world

1132
01:21:20,005 --> 01:21:21,882
They call me

1133
01:21:23,634 --> 01:21:26,303
I've delivered us to where we are

1134
01:21:26,803 --> 01:21:29,431
I have journeyed farther

1135
01:21:29,973 --> 01:21:32,351
I am everything I've learned and more

1136
01:21:32,726 --> 01:21:35,646
Still it calls me

1137
01:21:36,730 --> 01:21:38,982
And the call isn't out there at all

1138
01:21:39,149 --> 01:21:41,944
It's inside me

1139
01:21:42,402 --> 01:21:44,321
It's like the tide

1140
01:21:44,488 --> 01:21:48,825
Always falling and rising

1141
01:21:49,284 --> 01:21:51,662
I will carry you here in my heart

1142
01:21:51,828 --> 01:21:54,873
You remind me

1143
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:58,001
That come what may

1144
01:21:58,168 --> 01:22:01,171
I know the way

1145
01:22:01,338 --> 01:22:05,926
I am Moana

1146
01:22:40,377 --> 01:22:42,671
I am Moana of Motunui.

1147
01:22:44,214 --> 01:22:45,632
Aboard my boat...

1148
01:22:45,716 --> 01:22:47,551
I will sail across the sea...

1149
01:22:47,926 --> 01:22:50,888
and restore the heart of Te Fiti.

1150
01:23:27,090 --> 01:23:29,176
Te Kā can't follow us into the water.

1151
01:23:29,927 --> 01:23:31,428
We make it past the barrier islands...

1152
01:23:32,262 --> 01:23:33,472
we make it to Te Fiti.

1153
01:23:34,014 --> 01:23:35,265
None of which you understand...

1154
01:23:36,016 --> 01:23:37,518
because you are a chicken.

1155
01:24:44,042 --> 01:24:45,043
No!

1156
01:24:46,336 --> 01:24:48,797
Heihei! No, no, no!

1157
01:24:50,340 --> 01:24:51,508
Nice work!

1158
01:25:00,976 --> 01:25:01,935
Te Fiti.

1159
01:25:27,544 --> 01:25:28,962
Maui!

1160
01:25:33,050 --> 01:25:34,009
You came back.

1161
01:25:37,930 --> 01:25:39,223
But your hook.

1162
01:25:39,389 --> 01:25:40,891
One more hit and...

1163
01:25:41,767 --> 01:25:43,227
Te Kā's gotta catch me first.

1164
01:25:46,396 --> 01:25:48,398
I got your back, Chosen One.

1165
01:25:48,899 --> 01:25:50,067
Go save the world.

1166
01:25:50,150 --> 01:25:50,943
Maui.

1167
01:25:51,860 --> 01:25:52,861
Thank you.

1168
01:25:53,862 --> 01:25:55,113
You're welcome.

1169
01:25:55,864 --> 01:25:57,449
Cheeeehoooo!

1170
01:26:16,218 --> 01:26:17,344
Hot-hot-hot, hot-hot-hot!

1171
01:26:28,814 --> 01:26:30,274
Hey, Te Kā!

1172
01:26:31,233 --> 01:26:32,025
Shark head!

1173
01:26:33,610 --> 01:26:34,653
Cheeeehoooo!

1174
01:26:45,122 --> 01:26:46,290
Moana!

1175
01:26:56,466 --> 01:26:58,385
Get the heart to the spiral!

1176
01:27:36,215 --> 01:27:38,300
Te Fiti...

1177
01:27:38,467 --> 01:27:39,885
it's gone.

1178
01:27:52,523 --> 01:27:54,191
Te Kā!

1179
01:28:30,143 --> 01:28:31,311
Let her come to me.

1180
01:28:54,751 --> 01:28:58,297
I have crossed the horizon to find you

1181
01:29:05,512 --> 01:29:07,848
I know your name

1182
01:29:11,685 --> 01:29:15,564
They have stolen the
heart from inside you

1183
01:29:20,277 --> 01:29:23,447
But this does not define you

1184
01:29:26,992 --> 01:29:30,954
This is not who you are

1185
01:29:32,623 --> 01:29:37,878
You know who you are

1186
01:29:44,718 --> 01:29:47,387
Who you truly are.

1187
01:30:10,619 --> 01:30:11,662
Te Fiti!

1188
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:53,537
The chicken lives.

1189
01:30:55,372 --> 01:30:57,374
I'm sorry about your hook.

1190
01:30:57,875 --> 01:31:00,878
Well, hook, no hook...

1191
01:31:01,378 --> 01:31:02,963
I'm Maui.

1192
01:31:21,899 --> 01:31:23,650
Te Fiti!

1193
01:31:24,818 --> 01:31:26,737
Hey, I mean, how you been?

1194
01:31:29,990 --> 01:31:32,409
Look, what I did was...

1195
01:31:32,576 --> 01:31:33,994
wrong.

1196
01:31:34,161 --> 01:31:36,205
I have no excuse.

1197
01:31:36,830 --> 01:31:37,915
I'm sorry.

1198
01:31:46,924 --> 01:31:50,427
You know, it'd be rude to refuse
a gift from a goddess.

1199
01:31:51,553 --> 01:31:53,430
Cheeeehoooo!

1200
01:31:55,265 --> 01:31:56,308
Thank you.

1201
01:31:56,391 --> 01:31:59,019
Your kind gesture is
deeply appreciated.

1202
01:31:59,102 --> 01:32:00,103
Cheeeehoooo.

1203
01:32:48,819 --> 01:32:50,237
Gonna miss you, drumstick.

1204
01:32:50,404 --> 01:32:51,446
You could come with us, you know.

1205
01:32:52,364 --> 01:32:55,951
My people are going to need
a master wayfinder.

1206
01:32:57,494 --> 01:32:59,413
They already have one.

1207
01:33:17,806 --> 01:33:18,932
See you out there, Maui.

1208
01:33:19,850 --> 01:33:22,227
See you out there, Moana.

1209
01:33:22,811 --> 01:33:24,021
Cheeeehoooo!

1210
01:34:15,405 --> 01:34:17,032
Mom! Dad!

1211
01:34:17,199 --> 01:34:18,367
Moana!

1212
01:34:26,375 --> 01:34:30,921
I may have gone
a little ways past the reef.

1213
01:34:32,256 --> 01:34:33,882
It suits you.

1214
01:34:34,049 --> 01:34:34,842
She's back!

1215
01:34:35,259 --> 01:34:36,260
Moana!

1216
01:34:36,426 --> 01:34:37,427
Pua!

1217
01:34:39,805 --> 01:34:40,556
Moana!

1218
01:34:42,474 --> 01:34:44,017
Welcome home!

1219
01:35:33,942 --> 01:35:36,111
We set a course to find

1220
01:35:36,278 --> 01:35:40,532
A brand new island
everywhere we roam

1221
01:35:42,826 --> 01:35:45,204
We keep our island in our mind

1222
01:35:45,746 --> 01:35:50,042
And when it's time to find home
We know the way

1223
01:35:51,668 --> 01:35:54,630
We are explorers reading every sign

1224
01:35:55,297 --> 01:36:00,677
We tell the stories of our elders
In a never-ending chain

1225
01:36:07,142 --> 01:36:11,688
We know the way

1226
01:46:06,700 --> 01:46:08,076
Shiny

1227
01:46:08,619 --> 01:46:11,121
I'm so shiny

1228
01:46:11,747 --> 01:46:13,540
Didn't help me though, did it?

1229
01:46:13,707 --> 01:46:15,667
Still upside down here.

1230
01:46:15,834 --> 01:46:18,086
Just need a little push.

1231
01:46:20,255 --> 01:46:21,256
Can we be real?

1232
01:46:21,423 --> 01:46:24,801
If my name was Sebastian
and I had a cool Jamaican accent...

1233
01:46:24,968 --> 01:46:26,178
you'd totally help me.

1234
01:46:26,345 --> 01:46:27,971
You would. You know you would.
