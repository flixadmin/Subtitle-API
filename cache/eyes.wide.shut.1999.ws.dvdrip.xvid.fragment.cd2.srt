1
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:09,136
Please! Don't be foolish.

2
00:00:09,762 --> 00:00:11,556
You must go now.

3
00:00:16,352 --> 00:00:17,562
Who are you?

4
00:00:17,895 --> 00:00:20,064
It doesn't matter who I am.

5
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,942
You are in great danger.

6
00:00:23,943 --> 00:00:26,696
You must get away
while there's still a chance.

7
00:00:30,992 --> 00:00:34,036
Would you be so good as
to excuse us for a moment?

8
00:03:32,965 --> 00:03:35,510
Have you been enjoying yourself?

9
00:03:37,386 --> 00:03:40,973
Well, I've had a very
interesting look around.

10
00:03:43,601 --> 00:03:47,188
Do you want to go somewhere
a little more private?

11
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:51,692
Private?

12
00:03:54,403 --> 00:03:56,072
That might be a good idea.

13
00:03:56,322 --> 00:04:01,077
Here you are.
I've been looking all over for you.

14
00:04:02,954 --> 00:04:04,956
May I borrow him
for just a few minutes?

15
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,708
I promise to bring him right back.

16
00:04:17,802 --> 00:04:20,763
I don't think you realize
the danger you' re in now.

17
00:04:21,013 --> 00:04:23,015
You can't fool them for much longer.

18
00:04:23,266 --> 00:04:26,310
You've got to get away
before it's too late.

19
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:30,189
Why are you telling me this?

20
00:04:30,565 --> 00:04:32,441
It doesn't matter.

21
00:04:32,817 --> 00:04:33,693
Who are you?

22
00:04:35,486 --> 00:04:39,657
You don't want to know.
But you must go. Now!

23
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,035
Will you come with me?

24
00:04:43,286 --> 00:04:44,954
That's impossible.

25
00:04:45,204 --> 00:04:46,247
Why?

26
00:04:46,414 --> 00:04:50,751
Because it would cost me my life
and possibly yours.

27
00:04:52,044 --> 00:04:53,796
Let me see your face.

28
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,549
Go!

29
00:04:58,801 --> 00:05:00,386
Excuse me, sir.

30
00:05:03,598 --> 00:05:06,976
Are you the gentleman
with the taxi waiting for him?

31
00:05:08,436 --> 00:05:09,645
Yes.

32
00:05:09,854 --> 00:05:14,025
Your driver's at the front door and
would urgently like a word with you.

33
00:06:16,337 --> 00:06:19,799
Please, come forward.

34
00:06:52,123 --> 00:06:55,376
May I have the password, please?

35
00:06:58,045 --> 00:06:59,839
Fidelio.

36
00:06:59,964 --> 00:07:03,593
That's right, sir.
That is the password...

37
00:07:03,676 --> 00:07:05,511
...for admittance.

38
00:07:06,304 --> 00:07:11,225
But may I ask, what is the password
for the house?

39
00:07:16,772 --> 00:07:19,775
The password for the house?

40
00:07:31,078 --> 00:07:32,663
I'm sorry...

41
00:07:39,253 --> 00:07:40,880
I seem to have...

42
00:07:42,465 --> 00:07:44,050
...forgotten it.

43
00:07:45,843 --> 00:07:48,262
That's unfortunate.

44
00:07:49,096 --> 00:07:54,060
Because here, it doesn't matter
whether you have forgotten it...

45
00:07:54,477 --> 00:07:57,146
...or if you never knew it.

46
00:07:58,356 --> 00:08:02,401
You will kindly remove your mask.

47
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:24,257
Now...

48
00:08:24,966 --> 00:08:26,509
...get undressed.

49
00:08:32,932 --> 00:08:36,269
Get undressed?

50
00:08:37,436 --> 00:08:40,690
Remove your clothes.

51
00:08:52,201 --> 00:08:55,538
Gentlemen, please... .

52
00:08:58,374 --> 00:09:01,168
Remove your clothes.

53
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:05,214
Or would you like us to do it for you?

54
00:09:06,716 --> 00:09:07,842
Stop!

55
00:09:13,681 --> 00:09:16,517
Let him go.

56
00:09:18,436 --> 00:09:20,229
Take me!

57
00:09:21,772 --> 00:09:25,276
I am ready to redeem him.

58
00:09:31,449 --> 00:09:35,119
You are ready to redeem him?

59
00:09:37,205 --> 00:09:38,706
Yes.

60
00:09:41,584 --> 00:09:45,588
Are you sure you understand
what you' re taking upon yourself...

61
00:09:46,047 --> 00:09:48,132
...in doing this?

62
00:09:57,517 --> 00:09:58,851
Very well.

63
00:10:04,023 --> 00:10:05,775
You are free.

64
00:10:07,735 --> 00:10:09,362
But I warn you...

65
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:12,615
...if you make any further inquiries...

66
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,786
...or if you say a single word
to anyone...

67
00:10:16,911 --> 00:10:19,705
...about what you have seen...

68
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:24,335
...there will be the most
dire consequences for you...

69
00:10:24,669 --> 00:10:26,587
...and your family.

70
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:30,424
Do you understand?

71
00:11:10,298 --> 00:11:12,842
What is going to happen to that woman?

72
00:11:13,676 --> 00:11:16,679
No one can change her fate now.

73
00:11:17,513 --> 00:11:20,308
When a promise has been made here...

74
00:11:21,184 --> 00:11:23,686
...there is no turning back.

75
00:11:24,937 --> 00:11:26,189
Go!

76
00:13:36,319 --> 00:13:37,778
It's okay.

77
00:13:38,988 --> 00:13:40,448
I'm sorry.

78
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:45,536
I'm sorry I woke you up, but I thought
you were having a nightmare.

79
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,580
Oh, God.

80
00:13:48,664 --> 00:13:51,584
I just had such a horrible dream.

81
00:13:53,377 --> 00:13:54,962
What time is it?

82
00:13:55,421 --> 00:13:57,298
It's a little after 4.

83
00:14:00,009 --> 00:14:02,011
Did you just get home?

84
00:14:04,722 --> 00:14:08,476
It took longer than I thought.

85
00:14:08,893 --> 00:14:11,062
You must be exhausted.

86
00:14:11,687 --> 00:14:15,066
Come on, lie down.

87
00:14:23,741 --> 00:14:25,576
What were you dreaming?

88
00:14:31,749 --> 00:14:34,627
Just these weird things.

89
00:14:34,961 --> 00:14:36,420
What was it?

90
00:14:40,091 --> 00:14:42,760
It was so weird.

91
00:14:45,388 --> 00:14:46,639
Tell me.

92
00:15:07,743 --> 00:15:10,913
We were in a deserted city...

93
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,421
...and our clothes were gone.

94
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:22,258
We were naked...

95
00:15:27,763 --> 00:15:30,474
...and I was terrified...

96
00:15:35,479 --> 00:15:37,899
...and I felt ashamed.

97
00:15:38,983 --> 00:15:40,610
Oh, God...

98
00:15:44,989 --> 00:15:49,035
And I was angry because
I thought it was your fault.

99
00:15:51,621 --> 00:15:55,958
You rushed away to go
find clothes for us.

100
00:16:00,379 --> 00:16:04,342
As soon as you were gone,
it was completely different.

101
00:16:08,596 --> 00:16:10,598
I felt wonderful.

102
00:16:15,102 --> 00:16:19,774
Then I was lying
in a beautiful garden...

103
00:16:20,274 --> 00:16:23,486
...stretched out naked
in the sunlight...

104
00:16:28,407 --> 00:16:31,285
...and a man walked out of the woods.

105
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,836
He was the man from the hotel,
the one I told you about.

106
00:16:42,547 --> 00:16:44,382
The naval officer.

107
00:16:49,262 --> 00:16:51,472
He stared at me...

108
00:16:56,435 --> 00:16:58,604
...and then he just laughed.

109
00:17:01,524 --> 00:17:03,693
He just laughed at me.

110
00:17:19,959 --> 00:17:21,794
But that's not the end...

111
00:17:22,879 --> 00:17:24,088
...is it?

112
00:17:29,886 --> 00:17:32,221
Why don't you tell me the rest of it?

113
00:17:38,102 --> 00:17:40,062
It's too awful.

114
00:17:41,898 --> 00:17:43,774
It's only a dream.

115
00:18:09,258 --> 00:18:11,344
He was kissing me...

116
00:18:17,767 --> 00:18:20,603
...and then we were making love.

117
00:18:25,608 --> 00:18:29,111
Then there were all these
other people around us...

118
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,156
...hundreds of them, everywhere.

119
00:18:32,365 --> 00:18:34,909
Everyone was fucking.

120
00:18:40,748 --> 00:18:42,291
And then I... .

121
00:18:45,378 --> 00:18:47,880
I was fucking other men.

122
00:18:48,589 --> 00:18:50,299
So many...

123
00:18:51,884 --> 00:18:54,720
...I don't know how many I was with.

124
00:18:57,849 --> 00:19:02,728
And I knew you could see me
in the arms of all these men...

125
00:19:05,606 --> 00:19:08,484
...just fucking all these men.

126
00:19:12,947 --> 00:19:15,658
I wanted to make fun of you...

127
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,829
...to laugh in your face.

128
00:19:23,124 --> 00:19:28,087
And so I laughed as loud as I could.

129
00:19:42,185 --> 00:19:45,354
That must have been
when you woke me up.

130
00:20:29,607 --> 00:20:31,067
Shit!

131
00:21:08,145 --> 00:21:10,231
I'll just have a cup of coffee, please.

132
00:21:18,865 --> 00:21:20,116
Anything else?

133
00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:23,160
No, thank you.

134
00:21:29,959 --> 00:21:31,377
Excuse me.

135
00:21:32,378 --> 00:21:35,548
Do you know when they get in
next door at the Sonata Café?

136
00:21:35,756 --> 00:21:39,177
I think there's usually someone
in the office around 2 or 3.

137
00:21:43,723 --> 00:21:48,227
I don't suppose, by any chance,
you know Nick Nightingale?

138
00:21:48,436 --> 00:21:51,397
He's playing piano
over there right now.

139
00:21:51,689 --> 00:21:53,191
Nick Nightingale?

140
00:21:53,608 --> 00:21:56,194
Sure, he comes in here.

141
00:21:58,988 --> 00:22:01,782
Look, maybe you can help me...

142
00:22:01,991 --> 00:22:05,620
...because it's important that
I get in touch with him.

143
00:22:06,829 --> 00:22:08,581
Do you know where he's staying?

144
00:22:12,251 --> 00:22:15,338
I don't know if he'd want me
to give out his address.

145
00:22:15,546 --> 00:22:17,924
It's okay, I'm a doctor.

146
00:22:18,216 --> 00:22:20,676
I'm actually an old friend of his.

147
00:22:22,261 --> 00:22:23,763
Well, doctor...

148
00:22:26,265 --> 00:22:29,894
...he'll be playing there tonight.
Can't it wait until then?

149
00:22:32,897 --> 00:22:34,815
To be perfectly honest...

150
00:22:37,109 --> 00:22:38,861
...it's a medical matter.

151
00:22:39,278 --> 00:22:43,574
Some tests. I know he'll want to
know about them as soon as possible.

152
00:23:10,852 --> 00:23:11,769
Excuse me.

153
00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:15,690
Hi! How can I help you?

154
00:23:15,857 --> 00:23:19,652
Can you please ring
Mr. Nightingale's room for me?

155
00:23:20,194 --> 00:23:23,823
I'm sorry, sir, Mr. Nightingale
has already checked out.

156
00:23:24,073 --> 00:23:25,575
He checked out?

157
00:23:29,662 --> 00:23:33,541
-Did he leave a forwarding address?
-No, I'm afraid not.

158
00:23:34,917 --> 00:23:36,752
When did he check out?

159
00:23:38,254 --> 00:23:40,214
About 5:00 this morning.

160
00:23:40,464 --> 00:23:41,799
5:00?

161
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:45,428
That's an early checkout, isn't it?

162
00:23:45,595 --> 00:23:48,431
it is a little on the early side, yeah.

163
00:23:52,518 --> 00:23:55,396
Did you notice anything...?

164
00:23:55,771 --> 00:23:57,231
...I don't know...

165
00:23:57,899 --> 00:24:00,943
...unusual about him when he left?

166
00:24:02,945 --> 00:24:04,322
Unusual?

167
00:24:05,948 --> 00:24:07,950
Hey, you're not Five-O, are you?

168
00:24:09,493 --> 00:24:10,828
No, I'm an old friend of his.

169
00:24:11,078 --> 00:24:12,205
Really?

170
00:24:12,663 --> 00:24:14,123
I'm a doctor.

171
00:24:17,418 --> 00:24:21,797
-Well, Bill...?
-Sure.

172
00:24:24,175 --> 00:24:27,094
It's funny you should
ask that question, Bill...

173
00:24:27,303 --> 00:24:30,681
...because there was something
a little strange...

174
00:24:30,848 --> 00:24:33,392
...about the way Mr. Nightingale left.

175
00:24:33,726 --> 00:24:36,103
Really? What was that?

176
00:24:44,278 --> 00:24:48,824
He came in this morning,
about 4:30 am...

177
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,327
...with two men.

178
00:24:52,328 --> 00:24:53,996
Big guys.

179
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:57,542
They were very well-dressed
and very well-spoken.

180
00:24:57,750 --> 00:25:01,420
But they weren't the kind of people
you'd fool around with...

181
00:25:01,629 --> 00:25:03,422
...if you know what I mean.

182
00:25:06,217 --> 00:25:07,677
Anyways...

183
00:25:09,011 --> 00:25:13,766
...I noticed Mr. Nightingale
had a bruise on his cheek.

184
00:25:14,517 --> 00:25:19,438
To be perfectly honest, I also
thought he looked a little scared.

185
00:25:20,439 --> 00:25:21,607
Scared?

186
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,987
He said he wanted to check out.

187
00:25:26,195 --> 00:25:30,074
And then he went upstairs to his room
with one of the men.

188
00:25:30,408 --> 00:25:34,287
The other guy stayed down in the lobby
and settled his bill.

189
00:25:35,037 --> 00:25:39,167
When they came back, Mr. Nightingale
tried to pass me an envelope.

190
00:25:39,417 --> 00:25:41,085
But they saw it and took it...

191
00:25:41,335 --> 00:25:44,255
...and said that any mail
or messages for him...

192
00:25:44,463 --> 00:25:49,051
...would be collected by someone
properly authorized to do so.

193
00:25:49,844 --> 00:25:52,346
And then they just
took him off in a car.

194
00:25:53,681 --> 00:25:56,017
Do you have any idea where they went?

195
00:25:56,434 --> 00:25:58,311
No, not a clue.

196
00:26:10,448 --> 00:26:12,617
I certainly appreciate your help.

197
00:26:12,825 --> 00:26:14,452
Anytime, Bill.

198
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:53,282
Oh, the good doctor!

199
00:26:54,951 --> 00:26:59,956
-Was your outfit a success?
-Yes, it was. Thank you.

200
00:27:00,498 --> 00:27:01,791
Good, good.

201
00:27:01,999 --> 00:27:07,004
Tuxedo. Cloak. Shoes.

202
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:13,344
I think you forgot the mask.

203
00:27:14,637 --> 00:27:16,138
It's not there?

204
00:27:17,056 --> 00:27:19,642
Maybe you left it at the party?

205
00:27:24,689 --> 00:27:26,274
I don't think so.

206
00:27:28,234 --> 00:27:31,779
I must have lost it.
Could you put it on the bill, please?

207
00:27:31,988 --> 00:27:32,989
Sure.

208
00:27:37,285 --> 00:27:39,161
Here we are.

209
00:27:40,705 --> 00:27:44,792
That was 1 50 for the rental,
200 you said for my trouble...

210
00:27:45,001 --> 00:27:48,462
...25 for the mask. Sorry...

211
00:27:51,215 --> 00:27:52,884
Three hundred seventy-five.

212
00:27:55,469 --> 00:27:56,804
Yes, dear?

213
00:27:57,138 --> 00:27:58,598
Come, come.

214
00:27:59,807 --> 00:28:02,810
Would you like to say hello
to Dr. Harford?

215
00:28:12,111 --> 00:28:14,947
Thank you, Mr. Milich.
I'll call you soon.

216
00:28:15,865 --> 00:28:17,783
Goodbye, gentlemen.

217
00:28:18,075 --> 00:28:21,329
-Merry Christmas and happy New Year!
-And you too.

218
00:28:22,288 --> 00:28:24,540
Well, Dr. Harford...

219
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:27,376
...here is your receipt.

220
00:28:28,711 --> 00:28:30,963
I'm tearing up your deposits...

221
00:28:32,131 --> 00:28:34,467
...and thanks for the business.

222
00:28:39,055 --> 00:28:42,350
Mr. Milich, last night...

223
00:28:45,144 --> 00:28:47,563
...you were going to call the police.

224
00:28:49,106 --> 00:28:53,194
Things change.
We have come to another arrangement.

225
00:28:53,402 --> 00:28:58,366
And by the way, if the good doctor
should ever want anything again...

226
00:28:58,991 --> 00:29:00,743
...anything at all...

227
00:29:01,744 --> 00:29:04,288
...it needn't be a costume.

228
00:29:31,774 --> 00:29:33,025
Come in.

229
00:29:34,735 --> 00:29:37,488
-Tuna salad and black coffee.
-Thanks.

230
00:29:38,531 --> 00:29:41,576
Listen, how's my afternoon looking?

231
00:29:41,784 --> 00:29:46,747
I think it's just Mrs. Akerly at 2:30
and Mrs. Kominski at 4.

232
00:29:47,123 --> 00:29:51,335
Well, something's come up, and I'm
not going to be able to see them.

233
00:29:51,586 --> 00:29:55,256
Please ask Dr. Miller if he can fit
them in. Otherwise, just apologize...

234
00:29:55,464 --> 00:29:57,383
-...and make new appointments.
-Sure.

235
00:29:57,842 --> 00:30:01,929
And please call the garage and have
them get my car out in half an hour.

236
00:30:02,138 --> 00:30:03,472
No problem.

237
00:33:53,244 --> 00:33:55,913
Any calls for me?

238
00:33:56,122 --> 00:34:00,084
Dr. Sanders and Mrs. Shapiro.

239
00:34:01,377 --> 00:34:03,838
-Hey, gang.
-Hi, Daddy.

240
00:34:04,714 --> 00:34:06,674
Look, I got all these right.

241
00:34:06,883 --> 00:34:08,885
You got all of those right?

242
00:34:09,427 --> 00:34:11,179
Every single one of them?

243
00:34:11,554 --> 00:34:12,847
That's good.

244
00:34:13,055 --> 00:34:14,640
You hungry?

245
00:34:15,725 --> 00:34:17,059
Sort of.

246
00:34:17,268 --> 00:34:19,061
Want to eat at 7?

247
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:21,606
Seven? Listen, can we
make that earlier?

248
00:34:21,814 --> 00:34:25,776
I have some appointments
at the office.

249
00:34:25,985 --> 00:34:28,029
You have to go out again tonight?

250
00:34:28,237 --> 00:34:29,238
I'm afraid so.

251
00:34:29,447 --> 00:34:32,950
Daddy, am I gonna get
a puppy for Christmas?

252
00:34:33,576 --> 00:34:36,037
We'll see about that, okay?

253
00:34:38,623 --> 00:34:40,708
He could be a watchdog... .

254
00:34:40,917 --> 00:34:42,418
We'll see.

255
00:34:42,627 --> 00:34:45,379
Come on, baby, let's finish this off.

256
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:49,217
All right, we have Joe.
And Joe has $2.50.

257
00:34:49,425 --> 00:34:54,055
And Mike has $ 1 .75.

258
00:34:54,263 --> 00:34:57,934
Joe has how much more money than Mike?

259
00:34:58,142 --> 00:35:00,478
$0.75?

260
00:35:02,396 --> 00:35:05,775
So is it gonna be
a subtraction or an addition?

261
00:35:09,529 --> 00:35:12,782
""How much more"" means that
it would be a subtraction.

262
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:16,035
Yeah, because you're going
to be taking. Right.

263
00:35:16,327 --> 00:35:19,622
And there were all these
other people around Us.

264
00:35:19,997 --> 00:35:22,458
Hundreds of them, everywhere.

265
00:35:22,959 --> 00:35:25,211
Everyone was bucking.

266
00:35:26,128 --> 00:35:29,632
And then I...
I was bucking other men.

267
00:35:31,008 --> 00:35:32,677
So many...

268
00:35:33,135 --> 00:35:36,097
...I don't know how many I was with.

269
00:37:13,611 --> 00:37:16,322
Keep the change. Merry Christmas.

270
00:37:46,978 --> 00:37:47,854
What is it?

271
00:37:48,104 --> 00:37:49,313
Domino?

272
00:37:49,647 --> 00:37:51,524
No, she's not in.

273
00:37:55,486 --> 00:37:57,697
Are you expecting her back soon?

274
00:37:57,905 --> 00:37:59,407
No, I'm not.

275
00:38:06,038 --> 00:38:09,458
I have something for her.
Can I leave this with you?

276
00:38:10,334 --> 00:38:11,627
Just a minute.

277
00:38:18,676 --> 00:38:20,469
Can I say who it's from?

278
00:38:21,971 --> 00:38:24,348
Well, just tell her it's from...

279
00:38:25,391 --> 00:38:26,392
...Bill.

280
00:38:26,976 --> 00:38:28,227
You're Bill?

281
00:38:29,812 --> 00:38:33,816
The Bill? You're the doctor
who was here last night?

282
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:37,320
Well, I suppose I am.

283
00:38:37,653 --> 00:38:39,947
Domino said how nice you were to her.

284
00:38:41,282 --> 00:38:42,366
Did she?

285
00:38:45,203 --> 00:38:47,205
Why don't you come in for a second?

286
00:38:50,249 --> 00:38:51,292
Sure.

287
00:39:12,063 --> 00:39:13,564
I'm Sally.

288
00:39:14,315 --> 00:39:16,192
Hello, Sally.

289
00:39:19,237 --> 00:39:24,242
So do you have any idea
when you expect Domino back?

290
00:39:27,787 --> 00:39:29,747
I have no idea.

291
00:39:30,665 --> 00:39:32,667
You have no idea?

292
00:39:38,172 --> 00:39:43,135
To be perfectly honest,
she may not even be coming back.

293
00:39:45,388 --> 00:39:48,224
She may not even be coming back?

294
00:40:08,953 --> 00:40:10,121
I...

295
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:14,667
You...?

296
00:40:14,917 --> 00:40:19,255
I think there's something
that I should tell you.

297
00:40:19,755 --> 00:40:20,882
Really?

298
00:40:22,633 --> 00:40:25,469
But I just don't know.
I don't know.

299
00:40:25,678 --> 00:40:28,973
You don't know?
Well, what is it?

300
00:40:33,019 --> 00:40:35,313
I don't know whether to tell you this.

301
00:40:40,943 --> 00:40:43,821
Why don't you have a seat?

302
00:40:44,530 --> 00:40:46,282
Let's sit down.

303
00:41:02,465 --> 00:41:06,802
-I don't quite know how to say this.
-You don't quite know how?

304
00:41:11,182 --> 00:41:14,977
Well, considering that you
were with Domino last night...

305
00:41:17,522 --> 00:41:21,943
...I think it would be only fair to you
to let you know...

306
00:41:25,071 --> 00:41:28,366
...that she got the results
of a blood test this morning...

307
00:41:28,574 --> 00:41:31,828
...and it was HIV-positive.

308
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,715
HIV-positive?

309
00:42:00,147 --> 00:42:05,027
I am very, very sorry to hear that.

310
00:42:12,243 --> 00:42:15,246
I mean, it's absolutely devastating.

311
00:42:28,259 --> 00:42:30,928
Listen, can I offer you anything?

312
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:33,389
A cup of coffee maybe?

313
00:42:42,064 --> 00:42:43,441
No, thank you.

314
00:42:48,237 --> 00:42:49,822
I think...

315
00:42:51,157 --> 00:42:53,075
...maybe I'd better be going.

316
00:44:42,018 --> 00:44:43,603
-Taxi!
-Off duty.

317
00:46:33,421 --> 00:46:36,465
I'll just have a cappuccino, please.

318
00:46:36,674 --> 00:46:38,467
I'll bring it over to you.

319
00:46:38,676 --> 00:46:39,844
Thank you.

320
00:48:19,902 --> 00:48:21,195
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

321
00:48:21,404 --> 00:48:22,864
I'm Dr. Harford.

322
00:48:23,114 --> 00:48:27,451
One of my patients was admitted
this morning. Miss Amanda Curran.

323
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:29,704
Could you please
give me her room number?

324
00:48:29,954 --> 00:48:33,708
Certainly, doctor.
Her name again?

325
00:48:34,125 --> 00:48:36,711
Curran. Amanda Curran.

326
00:48:36,919 --> 00:48:39,088
C-U-R-R-A-N?

327
00:48:43,676 --> 00:48:45,511
Miss Amanda Curran?

328
00:48:46,304 --> 00:48:47,597
That's right.

329
00:48:48,347 --> 00:48:51,809
I'm sorry, doctor.
Miss Curran died this afternoon.

330
00:48:55,855 --> 00:48:57,732
She died this afternoon?

331
00:48:58,107 --> 00:49:01,444
Yes, at 3:45 p.m.

332
00:49:01,903 --> 00:49:03,362
I'm sorry.

333
00:49:51,536 --> 00:49:54,163
Because it could cost me my life...

334
00:49:55,122 --> 00:49:57,124
...and possibly yours.

335
00:51:43,022 --> 00:51:44,815
Yes, this is Dr. Harford.

336
00:51:46,984 --> 00:51:48,277
Tonight?

337
00:51:48,986 --> 00:51:51,113
No, no, that's okay.

338
00:51:55,201 --> 00:51:58,204
Please tell him I'll be there
in about 20 minutes.

339
00:52:21,853 --> 00:52:23,145
Come in.

340
00:52:25,189 --> 00:52:28,901
Bill, I appreciate you coming.
Sorry to drag you out here.

341
00:52:29,193 --> 00:52:31,904
-Let me have your coat.
-I was out anyway. Thank you.

342
00:52:32,113 --> 00:52:33,531
How about a drink?

343
00:52:34,073 --> 00:52:35,950
-Are you having one?
-Sure.

344
00:52:36,409 --> 00:52:37,827
What would you like?

345
00:52:38,286 --> 00:52:39,579
Just a little scotch.

346
00:52:39,787 --> 00:52:40,830
Good.

347
00:52:42,832 --> 00:52:44,000
How do you take it? Neat?

348
00:52:44,208 --> 00:52:45,334
Please.

349
00:52:47,086 --> 00:52:49,255
That was a terrific party
the other night.

350
00:52:49,463 --> 00:52:53,259
-Alice and I had a wonderful time.
-Well, good.

351
00:52:54,218 --> 00:52:56,012
It was great seeing you both.

352
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:57,680
Cheers.

353
00:52:58,389 --> 00:52:59,807
Were you playing?

354
00:53:00,266 --> 00:53:03,561
No, I was just
knocking a few balls around.

355
00:53:04,812 --> 00:53:07,523
-Beautiful scotch.
-That's a 25-year-old.

356
00:53:07,773 --> 00:53:10,234
-I'll send you over a case.
-No, please.

357
00:53:10,443 --> 00:53:11,444
Why not?

358
00:53:14,906 --> 00:53:17,074
You feel like playing?

359
00:53:17,283 --> 00:53:20,620
No, thanks.
You go ahead, I'll watch.

360
00:53:23,164 --> 00:53:24,624
I was just...

361
00:53:27,418 --> 00:53:28,544
Listen...

362
00:53:35,134 --> 00:53:40,097
The reason I asked you
to come over is...

363
00:53:42,016 --> 00:53:44,435
...I need to talk to you
about something.

364
00:53:45,311 --> 00:53:46,562
Sure.

365
00:53:49,774 --> 00:53:51,400
It's a little bit awkward.

366
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:56,948
And I have to be completely frank.

367
00:53:59,158 --> 00:54:01,202
What kind of problem are you having?

368
00:54:05,832 --> 00:54:07,917
It isn't a medical problem.

369
00:54:13,631 --> 00:54:15,007
Actually...

370
00:54:16,926 --> 00:54:18,845
...it concerns you.

371
00:54:31,899 --> 00:54:34,944
I know what happened last night.

372
00:54:38,948 --> 00:54:42,577
And I know what's been
going on since then.

373
00:54:47,248 --> 00:54:50,585
And I think you just might...

374
00:54:52,003 --> 00:54:55,423
...have the wrong idea
about one or two things.

375
00:55:08,728 --> 00:55:11,189
I'm sorry, Victor, I... .

376
00:55:13,191 --> 00:55:16,402
What in the hell
are you talking about?

377
00:55:18,529 --> 00:55:21,199
Please, Bill, no games.

378
00:55:23,367 --> 00:55:24,827
I was there.

379
00:55:26,787 --> 00:55:28,331
At the house.

380
00:55:31,918 --> 00:55:35,004
I saw everything that went on.

381
00:55:46,891 --> 00:55:50,853
What the hell did you think
you were doing?

382
00:55:54,524 --> 00:55:57,860
I couldn't even begin to imagine...

383
00:55:59,028 --> 00:56:00,696
...how you'd heard about it...

384
00:56:00,905 --> 00:56:04,534
...let alone got yourself
through the door.

385
00:56:08,371 --> 00:56:13,334
Then I remembered seeing you
with that prick piano player...

386
00:56:13,543 --> 00:56:16,796
...Nick whatever the fuck his name was,
at my party.

387
00:56:17,755 --> 00:56:20,758
And it didn't take much to
figure out the rest.

388
00:56:25,221 --> 00:56:27,056
It wasn't Nick's fault.

389
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:30,393
It was mine.

390
00:56:30,852 --> 00:56:32,854
Of course it was Nick's fault.

391
00:56:33,229 --> 00:56:36,732
If he hadn't mentioned it to you,
none of this would've happened.

392
00:56:36,941 --> 00:56:39,652
I recommended that cocksucker
to those people...

393
00:56:39,861 --> 00:56:42,822
...and he's made me look like
a complete asshole.

394
00:56:50,496 --> 00:56:52,415
What can I say?

395
00:56:58,754 --> 00:57:00,089
I had...

396
00:57:01,591 --> 00:57:03,176
...absolutely...

397
00:57:04,093 --> 00:57:08,764
...no idea you were involved
in any way.

398
00:57:10,183 --> 00:57:12,268
I know you didn't, Bill.

399
00:57:14,187 --> 00:57:16,230
But I also know that you... .

400
00:57:17,231 --> 00:57:19,817
You went to Nick's hotel
this morning...

401
00:57:20,067 --> 00:57:21,819
...and talked to the desk clerk.

402
00:57:23,404 --> 00:57:25,031
How do you know that?

403
00:57:27,033 --> 00:57:29,076
Because I had you followed.

404
00:57:34,999 --> 00:57:36,709
You had me followed?

405
00:57:39,086 --> 00:57:41,297
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.

406
00:57:41,797 --> 00:57:43,716
All right? I owe you an apology.

407
00:57:43,925 --> 00:57:46,594
This was for your own good, believe me.

408
00:57:47,011 --> 00:57:50,973
I know what the desk clerk told you.
But what he didn't tell you is...

409
00:57:51,265 --> 00:57:54,519
...all they did was
put Nick on a plane to Seattle.

410
00:57:54,810 --> 00:57:58,523
By now he's probably back
with his family...

411
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:01,067
...banging Mrs. Nick.

412
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:05,696
The clerk said he had
a bruise on his face.

413
00:58:07,657 --> 00:58:10,993
Okay, he had a bruise on his face.

414
00:58:12,036 --> 00:58:14,956
That's a hell of a lot less
than he deserves.

415
00:58:15,873 --> 00:58:20,002
I don't think you realize what
kind of trouble you were in last night.

416
00:58:21,337 --> 00:58:23,422
Who do you think those people were?

417
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:26,342
Those were not just
ordinary people there.

418
00:58:26,467 --> 00:58:29,887
If I told you their names--
I'm not gonna tell you their names...

419
00:58:30,054 --> 00:58:33,766
...but if I did,
I don't think you'd sleep so well.

420
00:58:37,478 --> 00:58:39,605
Was it the second password?

421
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:42,733
Is that what gave me away?

422
00:58:44,777 --> 00:58:47,029
Yes, finally.

423
00:58:49,115 --> 00:58:51,367
But not because you didn't know it.

424
00:58:53,369 --> 00:58:56,372
It's because there was
no second password.

425
00:58:57,498 --> 00:59:02,003
Of course it didn't help a whole lot
that those people arrive in limos...

426
00:59:02,253 --> 00:59:04,755
...and you showed up in a taxi.

427
00:59:04,881 --> 00:59:08,593
Or that they found the receipt from
the rental house in your coat...

428
00:59:08,885 --> 00:59:12,054
...made out to you-know-who.

429
00:59:29,655 --> 00:59:33,242
There was a woman there...

430
00:59:39,081 --> 00:59:40,791
...who tried to warn me.

431
00:59:46,506 --> 00:59:47,673
I know.

432
00:59:53,513 --> 00:59:55,223
Do you know who she was?

433
01:00:09,278 --> 01:00:10,988
She was a hooker.

434
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:22,250
Sorry, but...

435
01:00:23,334 --> 01:00:25,294
...that's what she was.

436
01:00:29,799 --> 01:00:31,008
A hooker.

437
01:00:45,690 --> 01:00:48,234
Suppose I told you...

438
01:00:49,944 --> 01:00:52,864
...that everything that
happened to you there...

439
01:00:54,407 --> 01:00:58,411
...the threats, the girl's warnings...

440
01:00:58,703 --> 01:01:01,455
...her last-minute intervention...

441
01:01:01,581 --> 01:01:05,418
...suppose I said that all of that...

442
01:01:06,752 --> 01:01:09,547
...was staged.

443
01:01:11,674 --> 01:01:15,511
That it was a kind of charade.

444
01:01:17,096 --> 01:01:18,931
That it was fake.

445
01:01:23,603 --> 01:01:24,896
Fake?

446
01:01:26,772 --> 01:01:29,275
Yes. Fake.

447
01:01:40,786 --> 01:01:42,788
Why would they do that?

448
01:01:43,581 --> 01:01:44,916
Why?

449
01:01:46,083 --> 01:01:47,835
In plain words...

450
01:01:48,753 --> 01:01:51,255
...to scare the living shit out of you.

451
01:01:52,465 --> 01:01:55,760
To keep you quiet
about where you'd been...

452
01:01:56,427 --> 01:01:58,012
...and what you'd seen.

453
01:02:18,157 --> 01:02:19,742
Have you seen this?

454
01:02:37,093 --> 01:02:39,178
Yes, I have.

455
01:02:44,642 --> 01:02:47,687
I saw her body in the morgue.

456
01:02:56,571 --> 01:02:59,740
Was she the woman at the party?

457
01:03:12,086 --> 01:03:13,379
She was.

458
01:03:27,685 --> 01:03:30,354
The woman lying dead in the morgue...

459
01:03:32,356 --> 01:03:34,192
...was the woman at the party.

460
01:03:42,950 --> 01:03:47,830
Well, Victor, maybe I'm
missing something here.

461
01:03:48,623 --> 01:03:52,210
You called it a fake, a charade.

462
01:03:53,794 --> 01:03:57,089
Do you mind telling me
what kind of fucking charade...

463
01:03:57,465 --> 01:04:01,302
...ends with somebody turning up dead?

464
01:04:07,183 --> 01:04:11,812
Okay, Bill, let's cut the bullshit.
All right?

465
01:04:11,938 --> 01:04:14,857
You've been way out of your depth
for the last 24 hours.

466
01:04:14,982 --> 01:04:18,569
You want to know what kind of charade?
I'll tell you exactly what kind.

467
01:04:19,779 --> 01:04:23,324
That whole play-acted,
""take me"" phony sacrifice...

468
01:04:23,616 --> 01:04:28,246
...that you've been jerking off with
had nothing to do with her real death.

469
01:04:28,496 --> 01:04:32,083
Nothing happened after you left
that hadn't happened to her before.

470
01:04:32,333 --> 01:04:35,253
She got her brains fucked out. Period.

471
01:04:36,712 --> 01:04:41,217
When they took her home,
she was just fine...

472
01:04:41,843 --> 01:04:43,469
...and the rest is in the paper.

473
01:04:43,594 --> 01:04:47,306
She was a junkie. She OD'd.
There was nothing suspicious.

474
01:04:47,598 --> 01:04:51,811
Her door was locked from the inside.
The police are happy. End of story.

475
01:04:53,271 --> 01:04:58,192
Come on. it was always gonna be
just a matter of time with her.

476
01:04:58,568 --> 01:05:00,153
Remember, you told her so yourself.

477
01:05:00,278 --> 01:05:04,282
You remember, the one with the
great tits who OD'd in my bathroom?

478
01:05:21,215 --> 01:05:25,344
Listen, Bill, nobody killed anybody.

479
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:28,389
Someone died. it happens all the time.

480
01:05:29,849 --> 01:05:32,226
But life goes on.

481
01:05:32,476 --> 01:05:34,061
It always does...

482
01:05:34,187 --> 01:05:35,646
...until it doesn't.

483
01:05:37,398 --> 01:05:39,233
But you know that, don't you?

484
01:09:03,896 --> 01:09:06,399
I'll tell you everything.

485
01:09:11,696 --> 01:09:14,073
I'll tell you everything.

486
01:10:05,875 --> 01:10:08,127
Helena's gonna be up soon.

487
01:10:25,102 --> 01:10:29,315
She's expecting us to
take her Christmas shopping today.

488
01:10:54,090 --> 01:10:55,258
That's nice.

489
01:10:55,424 --> 01:10:57,927
I could put Sabrina in here.

490
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:01,264
It's really pretty.

491
01:11:01,472 --> 01:11:03,391
It's old-fashioned.

492
01:11:12,608 --> 01:11:13,693
He's big.

493
01:11:14,068 --> 01:11:17,405
I hope Santa Claus gets me
one of these for Christmas.

494
01:11:17,530 --> 01:11:18,865
You do?

495
01:11:21,117 --> 01:11:23,369
Well, you're gonna
have to wait and see.

496
01:11:37,633 --> 01:11:39,677
What do you think we should do?

497
01:11:44,849 --> 01:11:46,142
What do I think we should do?

498
01:11:46,559 --> 01:11:47,768
Look, Mommy!

499
01:11:57,153 --> 01:11:59,822
What do I think?
I don't know.

500
01:12:01,908 --> 01:12:03,784
I mean, maybe...

501
01:12:15,838 --> 01:12:19,258
Maybe I think...

502
01:12:19,926 --> 01:12:22,303
...we should be grateful.

503
01:12:28,267 --> 01:12:29,894
Grateful...

504
01:12:30,394 --> 01:12:35,525
...that we've managed to
survive through all of our...

505
01:12:36,359 --> 01:12:37,944
...adventures...

506
01:12:40,488 --> 01:12:42,865
...whether they were real...

507
01:12:43,241 --> 01:12:45,493
...or only a dream.

508
01:12:54,919 --> 01:12:58,756
Are you sure of that?

509
01:13:02,677 --> 01:13:04,303
Am I sure?

510
01:13:20,069 --> 01:13:21,779
Only as sure as I am...

511
01:13:22,071 --> 01:13:25,908
...that the reality of one night...

512
01:13:27,243 --> 01:13:29,996
...let alone that of a whole lifetime...

513
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:35,042
...can ever be the whole truth.

514
01:13:41,799 --> 01:13:43,801
And no dream is ever...

515
01:13:45,636 --> 01:13:47,346
...just a dream.

516
01:13:55,938 --> 01:13:57,940
The important thing is...

517
01:13:59,859 --> 01:14:01,527
...we're awake now...

518
01:14:02,945 --> 01:14:05,239
...and hopefully...

519
01:14:08,284 --> 01:14:10,536
...for a long time to come.

520
01:14:14,165 --> 01:14:15,708
Forever.

521
01:14:17,835 --> 01:14:19,295
Forever?

522
01:14:21,672 --> 01:14:23,132
Forever.

523
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:29,138
Let's not use that word. You know?

524
01:14:30,431 --> 01:14:32,391
It frightens me.

525
01:14:42,735 --> 01:14:45,863
But I do love you...

526
01:14:48,950 --> 01:14:50,535
...and you know...

527
01:14:51,786 --> 01:14:53,996
...there is something very important...

528
01:14:54,121 --> 01:14:56,916
...that we need
to do as soon as possible.

529
01:14:58,084 --> 01:14:59,544
What's that?

530
01:15:02,588 --> 01:15:04,048
Fuck.
