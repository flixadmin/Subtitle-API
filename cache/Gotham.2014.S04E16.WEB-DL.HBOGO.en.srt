1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,400
<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:04,560
We could've had a good thing,
you and I.

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,560
- You?
- Yeah.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,200
Me.

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,440
When I get out of here,
I'm gonna confess.

6
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,840
My connections to Sofia, all of it.

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,040
No.

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,600
You wanna pay your debt?
You live with it.

9
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,040
it's what the city needs.

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,560
When I brought you back to life
I ask you to be

11
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,440
my eyes and ears in Gotham,
you became so much more.

12
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,680
- Let her go now.
- No!

13
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,640
- I'll never go with you!
- No!

14
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:37,080
You killed her!

15
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,440
So, now you're going to return it?

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,960
What am I supposed to say?
I stole your jewelry, sorry.

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:45,160
- Sometimes that's enough.
- Can you do it?

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,120
Migraine still? It's like I've been
hit in the head with a brick.

19
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,960
You could escape anytime.

20
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,120
You're planning something.

21
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,280
Something spectacular.

22
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,160
But when we're done,
the world out there,

23
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,160
that will be the asylum.

24
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,120
Get back in your front, Tetch.

25
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,720
Don't even try hypnotizing me,
I can't hear a word you're saying.

26
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm not talking to you!

27
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,200
I'm talking to him.

28
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,800
Geez. Tortuga.

29
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,680
You almost gave me
a heart attack.

30
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,080
Wait,

31
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,480
where the hell are your headphones?

32
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,600
Did I do it right?

33
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,760
{\an8}Why does it rain
in the plain in Spain?

34
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,040
Knock-knock call the cock.

35
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,920
Time to rise and wield your size.

36
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,280
I fear I will require
a moment more, Mr. Tetch.

37
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,600
Our moment is fleeting,
my dear Mr. Crane. It's wens.

38
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,800
Desperately beating.

39
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,720
And now...

40
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,920
scarcely a drop's build.

41
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,080
Shall we, Mr. Tetch?

42
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,960
Let us be the pains, Mr. Crane.

43
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,240
When I say three hairs
past the freckle, gentlemen,

44
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,720
I do not mean five hairs past.

45
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,920
Let's do better next time.

46
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,440
Mind both P's and Q's, Velaska.

47
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,520
We're not your militia
to be backed and come.

48
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,040
I dread to think
where you'd be without us.

49
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,280
Boys, boys, let's not squabble
too early in our partnership.

50
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,360
There'll be plenty of time
to stab each other

51
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,480
in the backs later. But for now,

52
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,800
stick to Jerome's plan
and everyone will get what they want.

53
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,600
Unearthly, Kingdom of Terror.

54
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,760
Piece of Gotham pie,
both sky and high.

55
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,720
That's the spirit, boys, think big...

56
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,840
and kinky.

57
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,400
And lose the weirdo.
She's getting me the heebie-jeebies.

58
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,720
Your work is done, my dear.

59
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,960
You race, I'll run.

60
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,960
Glad to be a cop.

61
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,960
Much better. Now...

62
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,240
to free the rest of our cronies
and blow this pop stand.

63
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,240
{\an8}Forward march!

64
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,840
{\an5}Are you sure you're up for this,
Captain Gordon?

65
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,920
{\an5}I'll manage.

66
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,960
{\an5}Picked the hell of the night
to come back on the job.

67
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,880
{\an5}- How many got out?
- Eighty-seven.

68
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,760
{\an5}The entire violent ward.

69
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,560
{\an5}Yeah, we rounded up
most of the serious nutjob

70
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,080
{\an5}so the guys, they think
they're walruses and whatnot.

71
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,000
{\an5}From snow child murderer,

72
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,880
{\an5}Daedalus Bache mutilator, Erasmus
reign cult-killer, all at large.

73
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,560
{\an5}Surviving guards think your buddy,
Tetch, was behind it.

74
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,840
{\an5}No.

75
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,280
{\an5}This big.

76
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:48,680
{\an5}That's insane Jerome Valeska
put this together.

77
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,760
{\an5}And there'll be more to come.

78
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,240
{\an5}Got a lot of nerves
with the cops out here tonight.

79
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,240
{\an5}We're thinking along the same lines.

80
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,080
{\an5}And I know what you're thinking.

81
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,480
{\an5}Why not tell him the truth?

82
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,000
{\an5}About Sofia and the Pyg,

83
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,760
{\an5}get it all out in the open.

84
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,360
{\an5}I kept my mouth shut
like you told me to.

85
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,520
{\an5}Good. I'm telling you again,
don't slip.

86
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,200
{\an5}Go over there
and be Big Jim Gordon, hero cop.

87
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:15,880
{\an5}It's what they need.

88
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,200
{\an5}Even if it is a lie.

89
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,280
{\an5}- You're back.
- Nice to see you, sir.

90
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,960
{\an5}Back up there, back up there.

91
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,480
{\an5}Hey, back at it. All right.

92
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,200
{\an5}- Hey.
- Jimmy boss.

93
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,280
{\an5}All right, listen up.

94
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,160
{\an5}If I had known I'd be seeing
your ugly mugs tonight,

95
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,600
{\an5}I'd have stayed in the hospital.

96
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,960
{\an5}Jervis Tetch, Jonathan Crane,
Jerome Valeska.

97
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,120
{\an5}Each of these madmen

98
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,360
{\an5}has wreaked a different
kind of havoc in our city.

99
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,520
{\an5}Now, they're on the loose,
and presumably working together.

100
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,320
{\an5}Along with several dozen other
garden-variety psychopaths.

101
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,600
{\an5}Know their MOs, their associates,
their home turf.

102
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,960
{\an5}Gotham needs you tonight.

103
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,440
{\an5}Have each other's backs
and we'll get through this.

104
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,120
{\an5}- Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

105
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,360
- Captain Gordon.
- Jim, Jim, Jim.

106
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,760
Why so grim, Jim?

107
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,840
Tetch.

108
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,720
What do you want?

109
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,000
<i>I'm not playing any of your games.</i>

110
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,360
No games this time. Just some maims.

111
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,760
And your own share of blames
if you don't do what I tell you.

112
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,240
<i>Do it, James.</i>

113
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,360
<i>Find your way
to which street James went.</i>

114
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,720
Do it! Or I'm gonna kill someone!

115
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,240
In case you had any doubts.

116
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,160
- This is a set-up.
- That's our sort

117
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,400
of chance to catch him.

118
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,200
If we can get Tetch,
he can lead us to Valeska.

119
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,360
I'll put a squad together,
they can...

120
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,320
- come up behind...
- No. The force is spread too thin

121
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,680
looking for the escapees.

122
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,440
Let's go.

123
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,560
Sure.

124
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,400
You said we had to have each
other's backs this time, right?

125
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,880
I'm following your orders, Captain.

126
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,960
- I'd have thought.
- I'll alert the press.

127
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,240
What if we're hypnotized?

128
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,160
What?

129
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,680
Stick with me here.

130
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,320
We both listened to Tetch
on the phone.

131
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,760
What if he hypnotized us
and we're coming down here alone?

132
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,680
That would be pretty stupid,
wouldn't it?

133
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,640
So, what, we're either idiots
or hypnotized?

134
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,720
Good choices.

135
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,120
You did a good job
with the troops back there.

136
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,920
Thanks.

137
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,480
This is where the straight lines up.

138
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,400
What the hell?

139
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,560
We gotta get them out of there.

140
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,080
All right, don't shoot,
they're hypnotized.

141
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,640
- They're hypnotized, don't shoot.
- Let go!

142
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,160
All right, buddy, come on.

143
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,240
Hey.

144
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,880
Lo and behold.

145
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:04,200
The bold Captain Jim Gordon
and his rusty caboose in tow.

146
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,080
You have us, Tetch, let them go.

147
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,560
Do you recall

148
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,880
when I first came
to this fair city gym,

149
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,960
a bawling mess?

150
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,200
When nothing more
than to address the safety

151
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,080
of my dear sister Alice.

152
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,240
What's the choice this time, Tetch?

153
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,680
How do I save them?
Just tell me what you want?

154
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,520
What I want is my sister wreak!

155
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,400
But you kept me from saving her...

156
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,800
you gave me no choice!

157
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,360
So no more choices to you either.

158
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,160
No more saving.

159
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,000
No!

160
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,000
Soon the bells will toll, Jim.

161
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,160
How many more will go cold, Jim?

162
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,080
Like your soul, Jim.

163
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,600
How many would be flyers,
would-be dyers, splatter

164
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,320
like my force spitted Alice,

165
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:10,640
when the Gotham bells told them
full roll!

166
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,920
So do you mean it helping,
you don't say.

167
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,000
Let me think about walking
straight to the G.C.P.D.

168
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,440
You wanna bail out now?

169
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,880
No, I just wanna make sure
there's no...

170
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,560
jewelry death.

171
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,880
There's no death.

172
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,920
I'll help you to get the jewelry
back because I wanna help.

173
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,200
Nobody does anything just to help.

174
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,080
Fine. Once this is over,
there'll be nothing left

175
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,120
to set up between us. Can you do it?

176
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,120
Okay.

177
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,040
Okay, got it. Which file?

178
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,360
Jerome Valeska,
there'll be a red Arkham stamp on it.

179
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,800
Valeska, what do you want
with that night?

180
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,120
He broke out the Arkham tonight.

181
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,680
Yeah,
what's that have to do with you?

182
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,520
Can you just get the file
before someone sees us.

183
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,200
<i>The largest single breach
of security</i>

184
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,760
<i>and the trouble history
of Arkham Asylum</i>

185
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,480
<i>has led to a city wile curfew
as many of the worst criminals</i>

186
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,600
<i>who have ever play Gotham
on the streets.</i>

187
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,400
<i>Twenty-seven deaths
have been attributed</i>

188
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,520
<i>to the escapees...</i>

189
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,400
The whole city is going crazy-pants.

190
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,800
Can you turn that thing off.

191
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,040
We could be out there
making a killing

192
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,280
while the cops are running up
all these nut jobs.

193
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,480
I am gonna go nuts,

194
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,640
if you don't turn
that damn thing off!

195
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,200
<i>Beware that these escapees
are extremely dan...</i>

196
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,360
Another migraine?

197
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,480
I think a little self-medication
will fix.

198
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,960
And your hand...

199
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,120
got a pill for that?

200
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,440
I'll fix it.

201
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,320
I've been reading ancient history,
mysticism, philosophy,

202
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,080
anything that might reference
Ra's al Goul.

203
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,160
I'm sick of hearing
that charlatan's name.

204
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,360
He brought me back to life.

205
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,480
We'd never even met.
Why choose me...

206
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,720
For all you know he lied to you.

207
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,960
Maybe he just told you you were dead.

208
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,800
When you came,
you don't remember what happened.

209
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,440
It hurts to remember.

210
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,760
What?

211
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,920
The attacks I'm having...

212
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,920
is like memories are trying
to push their way

213
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,160
into my brain,
but when I go to touch them,

214
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,960
it's just the searing pain.

215
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,600
You have to let them in.

216
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,400
It hurts too much.

217
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,760
Listen to you,
whining like a little baby.

218
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,800
- What?
- You have been hiding here

219
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,520
for weeks reading these books.

220
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,240
And now, you're telling me
you might have all the answers

221
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,640
in your head,
but you don't wanna get them

222
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,120
because it hurts too much.

223
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,680
You have no idea
what you are talking about.

224
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,320
No, I have no idea
who I'm talking to.

225
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,040
The Barbara I know
wouldn't let anything

226
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,320
that she is afraid of stand
in the way of what she wants.

227
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,360
Not cops, not criminals, not blood,

228
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,200
and not pain.

229
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,280
I remember when it all went dark.

230
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:39,880
This is...

231
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,160
blinding electric light and then...

232
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,600
nothing.

233
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,160
But then, I remember...

234
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,240
I remember...

235
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,840
<i>I know. I hear you.</i>

236
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,560
The world and its cruelties,

237
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,080
how unfair it's being to you.

238
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,760
I can hear you cursed me.

239
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:43,360
What a vital,
poisonous little mind you have.

240
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,080
And yet,

241
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,920
everybody hates you for it,
don't they?

242
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,680
Yes.

243
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,680
Everybody hates me.

244
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,480
You don't know why?

245
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,840
I understand that
feeling very well, Barbara.

246
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,320
You...

247
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,640
are just the one
I have been looking for.

248
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,200
And I have a present for you,

249
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,080
but it's a secret.

250
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:18,080
You shall become The Demon's Head,

251
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,800
the league of shadows
will be yours to command.

252
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,280
Army of assassins.

253
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,080
The world is weak, Barbara.

254
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,400
And you are strong.

255
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,760
Use the league

256
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:42,600
to make the world long light.

257
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,080
- You...
- <i>Barbara</i>.

258
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,200
Barbara.

259
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,320
I'm okay.

260
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,960
Ra's just really...

261
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,200
understood me.

262
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,640
Say, you remember something?

263
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,440
Yeah.

264
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,760
It's a beacon. Calling them here.

265
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,400
And they're coming.

266
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:10,360
Who?

267
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,240
The League of Shadows.

268
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,320
All right. Hey!

269
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,800
Same story all around.

270
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,840
Last thing they remember
is they were driving,

271
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,880
then they were here, then it was
cluck, cluck here chick, their chick.

272
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,320
Any luck?

273
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,040
Something bad is gonna happen.

274
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,200
And there's a time limit.

275
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,960
That's the Gotham bell's full roll.

276
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,120
Midnight, right?
That's less than an hour.

277
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,520
What's the bad thing
that's gonna happen?

278
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,360
I don't know.
He's gonna hypnotize more people.

279
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,680
To do what?

280
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,480
<i>"Splatted like my spitted Alice."</i>

281
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,200
Her sister Alice jumped, was impaled.

282
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,360
<i>"Flyers will become dyers
they'll be splatted."</i>

283
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,000
- No.
- Yeah, yeah, come on.

284
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,520
Bruce Wayne? What are you doing here?

285
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,440
Detective Harper,
where is Captain Gordon?

286
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,000
- I need to see him.
- He's out on the Arkham Break.

287
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,080
What do you need?

288
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,680
I need protection.

289
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,000
Last year, I captured Jerome Valeska.

290
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,560
He's clearly escaped
so I didn't get his revenge on me.

291
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,640
Okay,
I think, a little bit more than that.

292
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,560
I'm very close friends
with Captain Gordon.

293
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,600
I'm sure he wants me
to be well protected but...

294
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,400
this is a matter of payment.

295
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,400
What do you... put that away.

296
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,000
What do you want? A bribery charge?

297
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,840
I... I just...

298
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,560
I'm sorry.

299
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,560
I'm just really scared.

300
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,480
I know Valeska wants me dead.
I just know.

301
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,600
Take it easy, Wayne.

302
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,080
All right, you can stay here.
You'll be perfectly safe.

303
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,040
Okay.

304
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,520
All right, Wayne.

305
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,440
I'll find you a seat.

306
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,160
Hold on, we're gonna get you down.

307
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,280
Tetch has a booby trap.
If we get too close, they'll jump.

308
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,160
But if we do nothing
they jump at midnight.

309
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,720
How did he get all of them?

310
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,840
The drivers,
how did he hypnotize all of them?

311
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,400
What's that matter?
We gotta help these people.

312
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,120
We're gonna put a net around
the building.

313
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,880
That won't work, Harvey.

314
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,680
Do you know this diner? Zack's?

315
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,400
No, why?

316
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,480
Look, Valeska's uncle owns it.

317
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,400
He might know
where Jerome would go after escaping.

318
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,560
Still sounds like a cop's job to me.

319
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,600
I could've killed Jerome
after he kidnapped me,

320
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,680
and I didn't.

321
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,200
Any harm he does now,
I share a part of it.

322
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,600
Either way,
I'm responsible for his life now.

323
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,760
I can't just wait to see
what the cops will do.

324
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,920
I... I have to get him back
to Arkham.

325
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,680
What?

326
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,800
Your ego, Bruce...

327
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,840
It's huge.

328
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,760
What?

329
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:35,280
Not everything is your fault
or your responsibility.

330
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,440
Get over yourself.

331
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,160
Make you a little easier
to be around.

332
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,040
Thanks for the advice.

333
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,520
You sure you don't need
my help anymore?

334
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,440
We're even?

335
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,120
You don't owe me anything,
Selina.

336
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,480
You never did.

337
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,240
And you're sure you haven't heard
from your nephew, Mr. Trumble?

338
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,880
That monster killed my sister.

339
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,840
I ever see him, his screams
are what you'll be hearing.

340
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,360
Just maybe give us a call
before things go that far.

341
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,400
Jeez, there's a lot of gum
under here.

342
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,080
You're lucky those flatfoots
didn't check under the table,

343
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,160
Uncle Zach.

344
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,840
I mean,

345
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,360
that'll be some kind of health
code violation or something.

346
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,440
Jim,
it's happening all over the city.

347
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,040
Thousands are climbing up
on roofs, more every minute.

348
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,200
Drivers, people at work,
in the streets, at home.

349
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,400
How's he getting to them?

350
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,000
Radio. He's broadcasting on radio.

351
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,480
He must have taken over
our radio station.

352
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,560
Which one? We don't have time
to hit them all.

353
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,440
Drivers who grabbed us.

354
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,360
They were listening
to the same station.

355
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,200
XDJ in here.

356
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,640
{\an8}WYED!

357
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,440
WEPV.

358
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,000
They're all on different stations.

359
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,800
He must've commanded
on the change of stations

360
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,000
so we couldn't find him.

361
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,720
There's only one way to know
which one he's using.

362
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,720
What are you doing?

363
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,200
No, no, no. Harvey.

364
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,560
- Harvey.
- Hey

365
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,440
- Harvey.
- Hey.

366
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,600
- Hey!
- WYED, clear!

367
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,720
- Harvey, no, let me go.
- Big B Radio.

368
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,880
That toilet paper jingle
I hate so much.

369
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,960
No, I got Tetch out of my head
once before.

370
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,200
- I could do it again.
- XDNJ.

371
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,960
- It's that song I hate.
- Come on.

372
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,480
Too cold.

373
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,800
Too hot.

374
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,880
Just right.

375
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,840
You always could cook up a storm,
unck.

376
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,600
I remember back in the circus,
we used to dare each other to sneak

377
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,120
into the chuck wagon.

378
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,840
Steal one of your cookies or two.

379
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,240
That reminds me of my favorite meal
you ever cooked.

380
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,800
You remember that time

381
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,080
you caught me trying to snag
a snickerdoodle?

382
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,480
That soup you made that day,
mamma mia.

383
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,080
What was the special
ingredient again?

384
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,520
Right.

385
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,360
It was my hand.

386
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,520
The one you dipped in a boiling pot
of chicken stock!

387
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,480
That smell...

388
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,040
it was...

389
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,680
mouthwatering.

390
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,680
Almost as good as this.

391
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,280
That's a good story, nephew.

392
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,880
Well, aren't you curious
about the soup?

393
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:20,000
Don't tell me there's poison in it.

394
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,720
Not at all.

395
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,880
You got me worried
there for a second, unck.

396
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,160
I set out three bowls of soup,
nephew,

397
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,520
so I'd have enough
for all my guests.

398
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,520
You remember Love Kid
from his strongman days

399
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,720
at the circus?

400
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,080
The minute I heard you broke out,
I knew you'd be headed here.

401
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,560
So I invited good old Love
for some supper.

402
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,440
But just right, soup is for him.

403
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,680
The cold is for me.

404
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,960
I always love gazpacho!

405
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:58,760
The too hot, that's for you, nephew.

406
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,480
I'm just saying how could there be

407
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,680
a global army of assassins
we'd never heard of?

408
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,480
What part of League of Shadows
do you not understand?

409
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,520
- And they're coming here?
- To me.

410
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,120
They're coming to me.

411
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,520
Well, hello, Barb,
shouldn't you be getting ready

412
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,840
for them or something?

413
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,440
I'm ready.

414
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,960
Soon as they wanna show themselves.

415
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,040
What?

416
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,120
You can stop hiding.

417
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,920
I know you're there.

418
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,240
We're here for the Demon's Head.

419
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,040
Where is he?

420
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,360
She...

421
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,560
is right here.

422
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,600
Harvey!

423
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,040
WZPZ.

424
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,480
<i>Top of every tower.</i>

425
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,440
- Jim, WZPZ.
- <i>When the clock strikes 12...</i>

426
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,360
- <i>Hell no!</i>
- Stop listening.

427
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,600
That's an order, you hear me?
Stop listening.

428
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,680
- WZPZ.
- Change the station.

429
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,640
Come on, Harvey, change the station!

430
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,560
Sorry, pal,
there's something I gotta do.

431
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,680
Hickory dickory dock,

432
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,400
the copper went up the clock.

433
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,440
The clock struck 12,
he felt pelt melon,

434
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,800
and that was it for the cop.

435
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,080
<i>- Gotham Central.</i>
- Harper, it's Gordon.

436
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,680
Cap, it is crazy here.
I got seven cops ready to jump.

437
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,560
I got calls coming in
from everywhere.

438
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,680
It's Tetch. He's broadcasting
for the WZPZ station.

439
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,040
- Okay, I'll re-direct units.
- <i>No.</i>

440
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,240
I want all cars on the street
ready to amplify

441
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,440
the emergency G911 band.

442
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,440
Ready our teams
on as many roads as possible.

443
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,680
- And then what?
- Wait for my signal.

444
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,880
What, wait, wait, wait.

445
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,960
No!

446
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,120
Hey, there, nephew,

447
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,560
have a taste
of one of my three soups.

448
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,720
No, no, no.

449
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,920
My sister had the wrong idea
with you keeping you around.

450
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
She should've put you in a sack
with some rocks,

451
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,320
and dropped you in the river.

452
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,200
Put this creep out of our misery.

453
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,520
- What the hell are you doing?
- Get out of here, kid.

454
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:45,680
No.

455
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:49,520
Look, kid, I appreciate
a concerned citizen and all,

456
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,480
but this is Jerome Valeska.

457
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,680
The psycho
who broke out of Arkham tonight.

458
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,040
And what we're doing is giving him
what he deserves.

459
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,160
No one deserves that.

460
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,480
You tell them that.

461
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,200
- Shut up.
- Stop.

462
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,880
Call the police,
and they'll come for him.

463
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,840
Jeez.

464
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:06,920
Let him go.

465
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,280
And get rid of the kid.

466
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,320
Look what we left lying around.

467
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,760
Enough re-living old memories,
Uncle Zach.

468
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,760
Tell me what I wanna know.
You know, why I'm here.

469
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,240
I don't know anything.

470
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,440
It's too bad we're out of soup.

471
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,640
I wonder what else is on the menu.

472
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,680
She's got the mark
of the Demon's Head.

473
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,920
Ra's chose her.

474
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,040
She doesn't even know what it is.

475
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,520
I know it means
I'm your new damn leader.

476
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,360
Is that all you think it is?

477
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,720
Ra's didn't explain everything.

478
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,000
Look at the mess he's left us with.

479
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,320
You have the mark
of the Demon's Head,

480
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,640
but no woman
has ever been allowed

481
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,040
to lead the League of Shadows.

482
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,640
- I'm sorry, you just said what?
- Women serve in the League,

483
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,760
but they do not lead.

484
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,440
That's not our law,

485
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,240
just a stupid tradition.

486
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,600
Ra's chose her.

487
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,880
We need to honor his choice.

488
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,960
That's true.

489
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,000
As long as you have
the Demon's Head,

490
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,240
the League must follow you.

491
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,800
Now, we're back on track.

492
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,520
So I guess I'll have to...

493
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,760
Cut the Demon's Head from you.

494
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,960
Anyone else want a shot at the title?

495
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,960
Here comes your plane.

496
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,720
No, no, no.

497
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,520
I'll tell you, I'll tell you,
I'll tell you. Look, look.

498
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,840
She picks St. Ignatius.

499
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,760
The school is St. Ignatius.

500
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,840
Got it. Lost it. Write it down.

501
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:06,960
Thanks. It's been great
catching up, Uncle Zach.

502
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,560
You really brought back
the utter helplessness

503
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,640
of childhood.

504
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,440
Well, see you around.
I mean, except the opposite.

505
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,800
Boy billionaire, Bruce Wayne,
my savior!

506
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,480
I did not see that one coming.

507
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,320
No.

508
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,040
With Uncle Zach,
the beatings just never stopped.

509
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,800
They went on and on, yet,

510
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,840
nobody ever help me...

511
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,240
Ever.

512
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,760
And it makes a man wonder.

513
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,040
What the hell is wrong with you?

514
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:54,240
The only thing funnier
than you saving my life...

515
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,760
Will be if I saved yours.

516
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,520
No!

517
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,640
No, wait.

518
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:04,000
What would be funnier is
if you are choked to death

519
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,680
by the guy
that you saved me from.

520
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
we'll do that instead.

521
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,560
Yeah, yeah, yeah, do your thing.

522
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,800
Almost magic hour, Gothamites.

523
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,720
Time to climb to the tippy top
of every tower.

524
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,560
When the bell strikes 12,
throw yourselves,

525
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:31,560
pommel over the edge
onto your heads!

526
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,680
Shut up, Tetch.

527
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,320
This is Captain Gordon
of the G.C.P.D.,

528
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,400
<i>am I coming through?</i>

529
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,440
You're coming through.
We can hear you all over the city.

530
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,160
All right, Tetch.

531
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,680
You're gonna tell those people to
set back from the ledge, no tricks.

532
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,480
You go off script,

533
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,680
and I'll shoot pieces of you.

534
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,600
So you do what I say.

535
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:03,520
I would love to do
as you command, Jim.

536
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,360
But sadly, I've tied my own hands.

537
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:08,440
Your hands.

538
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,000
I can't stop them.

539
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:25,640
If anyone tells them
to save themselves, they'll jump.

540
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,040
But you're more than welcome
to try, Jim.

541
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,040
I'm playing the next voice,
you hear!

542
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,040
Tell them anything!

543
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,160
It will not matter
when the bell start to ring.

544
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:41,040
Your, so callous caused
the death of my darling, Alice, Jim.

545
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,360
Try it and they die.

546
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,440
Stand by and they all try to fly.

547
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,400
Captain?

548
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,760
<i>Captain, what do we do?</i>

549
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,960
<i>How do we save them?</i>

550
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,160
Yeah, I can watch this all night,
Bruce.

551
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,360
Hands off big boy.

552
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,520
Still don't need my help, Bruce?

553
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,720
Selina.

554
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,960
Selina?

555
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Wasn't that a nice name?

556
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,040
- Selina?
- No, no, no.

557
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,760
She's not that kind of girl.

558
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,560
- Wrong answer freak.
- That's funny because...

559
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,760
All right.
See you crazy kids later. Ciao!

560
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,960
You should've let me shoot him.

561
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,680
It would've been over by now.

562
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,280
Selina, I told you
I'm responsible for him.

563
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,480
I can't just let him be shot
Selina, I can't.

564
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,360
I'm not taking
responsibility for this mess.

565
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,680
So let's get out of here
before the cops show up.

566
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,760
Yeah?

567
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:26,160
Come on.

568
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,480
It's not over yet.

569
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,200
Suit yourself.

570
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,160
Just don't take...

571
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,360
so much responsibility that,
you get yourself killed.

572
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,600
Some legacy
your dead boyfriend left you.

573
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,600
No.

574
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,440
Ra's chose me for a reason.

575
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,520
I know it.

576
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,720
You're weak.

577
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,240
You're also damn weak.

578
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,760
That's it.

579
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,680
That is why Ra's chose me.

580
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,240
Because he knew I would see
how pitiful you all are.

581
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,280
Afraid of change.

582
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,440
Afraid to take orders from a woman.

583
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,520
Well, listen up!

584
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,280
I am the demon's head!

585
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:58,360
So you sons of bitches better
start vowing down right now!

586
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,520
Or it's gonna get ugly up in here.

587
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,360
You're right.

588
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,200
They were weak.

589
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,560
And the mission
of the League of Shadows

590
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,000
is to call weakness.

591
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,480
They were unfit and needed to die.

592
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,720
But the Sisters of the League
are yours to command.

593
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,960
Well, so much of a league now,
is it?

594
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,480
We're the point of the spear,
Barbara.

595
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,720
Hundreds will follow you.

596
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,360
What the hell?

597
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,320
You have no idea
what they expect from you.

598
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,280
This is mine, Tabitha.

599
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,120
And I'm taking it.

600
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,920
Tell me what I need to know.

601
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,320
<i>Hey, Cap, what do we do?</i>

602
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,840
I can't save you.

603
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,600
Save each other.

604
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,720
<i>Save each other.</i>

605
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,280
<i>Save each other.</i>

606
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,640
<i>It worked.</i>

607
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,040
It worked.

608
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,320
They're stepping away.

609
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,120
- No.
- What?

610
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,000
- What happened?
- I got you. I got you.

611
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,200
Thank you.

612
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,400
Yes.

613
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,680
Heard we got nothing
from Tetch about Valeska's plans.

614
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,760
Not a word the whole time the medics
were patching him up.

615
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,800
Still, 40 escapees back in the can
and a lot of people with their feet

616
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,200
safely on the ground.

617
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,600
You need a drink.

618
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,360
I don't keep it around.

619
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,400
Squirrels hide nuts for the winner.

620
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,240
I...

621
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,200
got this for whenever.

622
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,120
I don't belong here.

623
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,240
I don't deserve to be here.

624
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,200
Not in this office,
not in this building.

625
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,640
By rights, I should be in jail.

626
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,080
No argument from me.

627
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,120
Let's say you were in jail
sucking on your own misery,

628
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,840
where would the thousands of people
you saved tonight be?

629
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,920
Where would I be?

630
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,800
What you did tonight was heroic.

631
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,120
You could've done what I did.
Anyone could have.

632
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,640
You know, what I was thinking
when I jumped in that car

633
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,360
and I was flicking
through those channels?

634
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,080
I was thinking,
"I can do this crazy thing

635
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:02,600
because if it goes sideways,
Jim Gordon will save me."

636
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,160
And here we are.

637
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,440
Who I am?

638
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,360
What I've always say I believe in...

639
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,120
it's like it's a lie now, Harvey.

640
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,400
A feet of clay are heavy
to carry around,

641
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,520
that's what the whiskey is for.

642
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,120
I judged you...

643
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,560
for a long time.

644
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,720
I shouldn't have done that.

645
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:43,440
What you know about me, Jim,
is just the tip of the iceberg.

646
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,760
There are no heroes here.

647
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,480
No heroes here.

648
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,240
Yes?

649
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,880
I got the Wayne kid on line three,
something about Valeska.

650
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,440
<i>Bruce, you okay?</i>

651
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,640
I saw Jerome Valeska tonight.

652
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,040
- He killed his uncle.
- What?

653
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:15,480
<i>He was looking the name
of a school, St. Ignatius.</i>

654
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,320
- Why?
- I'm on my way to find out.

655
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,880
<i>No. Wherever you are, stay put.</i>

656
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,120
Valeska is my problem
as much as anyone's.

657
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,680
<i>- I'm going after him.</i>
- Damn it, Bruce.

658
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,760
Stay the hell away
from that mad man.

659
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,800
I'll see you at St. Ignatius, Jim.

660
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,520
- You can deal with me there.
<i>- Bruce...</i>

661
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,480
Kid in trouble again?

662
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,800
More than he can handle.

663
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,400
Let's go.

664
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,600
How do you like the new threads?

665
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,640
Speechless. I know.

666
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,760
You look affright, Mr. Tetch.

667
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,200
This is what, lame,
my dear Mr. Crane.

668
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,400
But I do confess,

669
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,520
pure joy investing Jimmy Boy
with our ploy.

670
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,480
Yeah, yeah, you did a great job
keeping Gordon occupied.

671
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:28,080
Meanwhile, Crane got his fear gas,
I got my information,

672
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,120
everything is going
according to my plan.

673
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,160
But no time to pull average of a man.

674
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,480
We have fish to fry.

675
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:40,280
And by fish, I mean faces, or feet.

676
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,720
Something fun to fry.

677
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:46,240
Buckle up.

678
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,800
All aboard!

679
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,600
I'm coming.
