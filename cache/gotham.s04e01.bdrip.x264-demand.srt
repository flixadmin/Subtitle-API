169
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,713

170

174

This is the second one of these
I've come across,

175
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,511

177
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,239
Harvey, we cannot let this slide.

178
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,433
Word's come down from the Commissioner,

179
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,474
you find someone with one of those,
they walk.

180
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,080
And before you get on your high horse,

181
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,555
three months ago,
this city was in a tailspin.

182
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,917
We survived because Penguin
took control of the underworld.

183
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,680
I'm not giving this city over
to Penguin.

184
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,896
I don't care what the Commissioner says.

185

What about your fellow cops, huh?

186
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,071
The past month, how many have been shot?
None.

187
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,160
I know the stats.

188
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,949
Jim, we will bust Penguin one day,
I promise you.

189
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,438
But this city has to get back
on her feet, please?

190
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,800
Harvey, I get that.

191
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,229
But every day the citizens
of Gotham look to Penguin

192
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,231
and not the GCPD to keep them safe.

193
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,176
The harder it's gonna be
to win them back.

194

You want people to trust cops,

195
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,676
there are better ways of doing it
than spitting in Penguin's eyes.

196
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,669
You see one of these,

197
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,480

198
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,600
ALFRED: Bloody Penguin.

199
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,280
There must be some way
we can turn this against him.

200
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,557
Just stop. Stop, right there.

201
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,792
How does this fit into what we're doing?

202
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,196
What was the initial reason
that you popped on that mask,

203
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,280
and you went out there?

204
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,434
We agreed that I have to be ready
for when Ra's al Ghul returns.

You yourself said there's no substitute
for real world encounters.

we must hold to it.

for what happened.

210

a difference in Gotham, Alfred.

Wasn't sure what to do with it.

419
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,878
One of Penguin's licenses.

420
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,440
Apparently, crime is legal now.

421
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,960
And you're going along with that?

422
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,240
Not really.

423
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,514
There's a number on the license.

424
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,755
I was thinking Penguin must have
some sort of master list.

425
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,154
Connecting the crime and the criminal
to the license issue.

426
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,880
List like that would tell you
not only who committed that crime,

427
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,833
but crimes that haven't even
happened yet.

428
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,629
Unfortunately, the judges

429
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,120
are going along with the licenses.

430
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,555
And trying to track down

431
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,478
who in Penguin's organization
keeps the list

432
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,480
would set off too many alarms.

433

you were out tracking a gang.

It's different.

437
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,509
This gang isn't licensed.

438
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,233
But Penguin will come after them.
If he hasn't already,

439
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,555
and when he catches them,

440
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,874
it'II be more proof
that Gotham doesn't need the GCPD.

Sorry, it's been a long day.

So, why not use Penguin
to lead you to them?

443

how to do that, I would.

The rumor is you're issuing them.

00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,950
Tell me, what is the crime rate
in Gotham?

I'm rather busy,

Others will find out.
That's how it begins.

You've had a nice run, Oswald.
But it's over.

Oh, Jim, it's so hard to admit
when you've become irrelevant.

496
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,993
Let me tell you what's gonna happen.

497
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,949
I'm going to find this gang

498
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,760

Can we count on them?

Let's see. You tricked Penguin
into baiting the gang to attack his club

hoping to arrest them
before they cause mass panic

538

only so you could embarrass Penguin.
So I would say, yeah, they're about as

00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,120
In the weeks to come,

651
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,954
you will hear whispers

652
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,077
about what's happening
on the streets of Gotham.

653
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,078
AII you need to know is

654
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:09,910
without me, this is what you get.

655
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:13,550
Men who want to bring fear
back to our city.

656
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,878
Who promise a return to the old days.

657
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,469
So, tell your families,

658
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,275
tell your friends.

659
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:25,599

who keeps them safe.

You're welcome.

662
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,376
I have my things in the car,
we can stop them in the parking garage.

663
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,913
Absolutely not, Master Bruce.

664
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,576
Alfred, Penguin's gonna take
those men out and kill them.

665
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,600
Undoubtedly so.

666
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,320
But, as you said before,
you can make a difference.

667
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,552
There is time for masks,
and there is a time for Bruce Wayne.

what's going to be done to you?

Wait!

670
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,360
I want to know what
you're gonna do with those men.

You need not concern yourself with that.

672
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,656
Are those men going to be turned over
to the police?

Earlier tonight, you thanked me
for making the city safer.

675
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,199
Now, how do you think that happened?

676

Ido the dirty work no one else will.

677
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,800
I understand.

678
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,030
But I'm asking you,
turn those men over to the police.

679
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,360
You're young.

680
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,920
You have a good heart.

No.
