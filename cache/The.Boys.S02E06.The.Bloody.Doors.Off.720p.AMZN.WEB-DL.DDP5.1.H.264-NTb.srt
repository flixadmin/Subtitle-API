1
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:17,393
Freedom...

2
00:00:17,435 --> 00:00:19,145
...comes at a price.

3
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:21,188
- So, I'm down a point?
- Nine and a half.

4
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,231
Bad day?

5
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:24,483
- Goddamn it.
- Hey, I'm with you.

6
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:26,277
<i>But you know,
there's a way to handle it.</i>

7
00:00:26,318 --> 00:00:27,319
I owe you.

8
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,240
Thanks to
the Church of the Collective,

9
00:00:31,282 --> 00:00:33,033
<i>I now know the kind of man
I want to be.</i>

<i>- This is Homelander.</i>

11
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:37,413
<i>He's fucking with me.
I can't protect you</i>

12
00:00:37,455 --> 00:00:38,622
if you leave.

13
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:39,832
What are we gonna do?

14
00:00:39,874 --> 00:00:41,751
<i>You think, by saving Kimiko,</i>

15
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,002
<i>you can make amends</i>

16
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,420
for those children

17
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:46,213
- that Lamplighter burned.
- Fuck you.

18
00:00:46,255 --> 00:00:47,548
<i>You can't go through this</i>

19
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,633
- on your own.
- We're all alone.

20
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:59,226
How do you think the world
will feel when I tell them that

21
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:00,811
you used to be Liberty?

22
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:02,354
Wow.

23
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:19,914
Why are you laughing?

24
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:21,540
- You're ridiculous.
- Oh, no.

25
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:23,417
I am not, uh, ridiculous.

26
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:24,794
Okay.

27
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:26,962
- Then you are high.
- Well, beside the point.

28
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:29,715
Point is

29
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:32,051
I learned everything I know
from those girls.

30
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,385
<i>The Golden Girls.

31
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:37,431
I was alone in New York,
you know?

32
00:01:37,473 --> 00:01:39,433
Turning tricks.

33
00:01:39,475 --> 00:01:42,436
Begging for the scraps.

34
00:01:42,478 --> 00:01:45,856
Who do you think
kept me company?

35
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:47,233
<i>The Golden Girls.</i>

36
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,026
3:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m.,

37
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:52,279
they lit up
the shelter's shitty TV.

38
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:53,697
And you're not
talking about porn?

39
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,115
<i>The Golden Shower Girls?

40
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:56,492
- That's disrespectful.
- Aw.

41
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:58,118
He's so sensitive.

42
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,538
No. Those saucy ladies,

43
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:02,540
they made their own family.

44
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:05,501
So I did what they did.

45
00:02:06,544 --> 00:02:08,587
You are my Blanche.

46
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,089
- Blanche?
- And Jay?

47
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:13,676
You are...

48
00:02:13,717 --> 00:02:15,636
- my Dorothy.
- Mm-hmm.

49
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:17,096
'Cause you're a little gay.

50
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,098
Yeah.

51
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,225
- So, you're Betty White?
- Oh,

52
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:22,726
what a fucking question.

53
00:02:22,768 --> 00:02:24,728
Of course I'm Betty White.

54
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:29,275
Now...

55
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:34,321
Who wants to rob a bank?

56
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:35,739
Fuck, yeah.

57
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:43,998
Will it get through my skin?

58
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,458
If it can't, nothing can.

59
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,252
Okay,
I-I just feel like I need to say something.

60
00:02:48,294 --> 00:02:49,712
I don't think
this is a good idea.

61
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:51,589
Stormfront knows I leaked the V.

62
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,799
Yeah, but she hasn't
come after you.

63
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:55,467
Ye... But that makes it
so much worse.

64
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,137
That means that she has
some fucked-up plan for me.

65
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,930
I need this chip out now.

66
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:01,807
I understand, Petit Hughie.

67
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:04,685
And though you've been covered
with entrails of many a person,

68
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:06,270
even a sea mammal...

69
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:08,981
it's always harder
when it's someone you love.

70
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:10,482
- What?
<i>- L'amour.</i>

71
00:03:12,151 --> 00:03:13,402
No, no. No, I don't.

72
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:14,862
I mean, I-I do, of course.

73
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:16,530
It's just, it's a platon...

74
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:17,781
- We're-we're just friends.
- Okay,

75
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,575
can we just do this already
before I change my mind?

76
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:20,701
Please?

77
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,287
Okay, this is happening.

78
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:25,581
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

79
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:28,417
- This might sting a little.
- Okay.

80
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:40,262
Oh,
my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

81
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:42,473
Okay.

82
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:43,766
Okay.

83
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,863
Bonjour, my little spy.

84
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,842
Howdy ho, buckaroo.

85
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:24,598
Shit!

86
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,016
I think you broke my hand.

87
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:32,898
What do you want to do with him?

88
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,650
Well, hand him over
to the police,

89
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:37,069
- of course.
- Well, of course. We are heroes.

90
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:39,113
That's what heroes do.

91
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:42,074
- Absolutely.
- But...

92
00:04:42,116 --> 00:04:44,827
- he'll probably just be released tomorrow.
- Please,

93
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:46,537
- just take me to the hospital.
- Yeah.

94
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:47,538
Please.

95
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:49,957
That's a really good point.

96
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:51,834
You know,

97
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,836
sometimes it feels like...
like the justice system

98
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:56,797
just doesn't work anymore.

99
00:04:56,839 --> 00:05:00,426
Everyone always recording
on their phone all the time.

100
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,261
It's like you can't even

101
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,679
- do your job anymore.
- Do your job anymore.

102
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:08,308
Please, just take me in.
Just take me in, please.

103
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:17,276
It really speaks
to the deterioration

104
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:21,447
of good,
God-fearing American values.

105
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:22,531
Help me!

106
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,199
Oh, what's this world

107
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:25,492
- coming to?
- Oh, fuck.

108
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,149
<i>Don't be shy. Embrace it.</i>

109
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:58,358
<i>Thank... I'm saying thank you.</i>

110
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,693
<i>Well, you're welcome.</i>

111
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:00,736
<i>Let's be honest
for a moment here.</i>

112
00:06:00,778 --> 00:06:03,781
<i>Who is the biggest prankster
on set?</i>

113
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:07,034
<i>Ooh, I-I just... I don't think</i>

114
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:09,286
<i>we should get into that.
I don't know, I... No comment.</i>

115
00:06:09,328 --> 00:06:12,915
<i>I mean, he is right.</i>

116
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,918
<i>But, uh, you know,
Black Noir has definitely got</i>

117
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,253
<i>- just the biggest ego.
- Such a diva.</i>

118
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,588
They're fucking.

119
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,007
<i>...under that helmet.</i>

120
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,684
Did you get her chip out?

121
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,103
This is where you're living?

122
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:36,396
Yeah. You know,
it has its charms.

123
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:39,483
The rats are, like, uh, Pokémon.

124
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:41,693
- With hep C.
- Oh, God.

125
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,612
Oh, so you're back?

126
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,407
Tired of killing people
for money?

127
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:55,457
Uh, hi.

128
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,046
Remember me?

129
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:16,019
Well, well, well.

130
00:07:16,061 --> 00:07:18,021
What have we here?

131
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,151
I know what you're gonna say,

132
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,153
but we just took out her chip.
Everything's fine.

133
00:07:24,194 --> 00:07:27,489
Starlight, don't you
just light up a room, eh?

134
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:30,576
- You're looking well.
- Yeah, no thanks

135
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:33,036
to the .50-caliber round
that you pumped into my chest.

136
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:37,040
Well, what don't kill you
makes you stronger.

137
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:42,004
What's she doing here?

138
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:45,424
Uh, she has a lead
on Stormfront.

139
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,675
I broke into her laptop,

140
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:47,968
and I got a look at the inbox.

141
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,345
Dozens of e-mails
from Stan Edgar.

142
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:53,140
Stan Edgar?

143
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:56,268
And what does Vought's
big slapper have to say?

144
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,895
How they're close
to a breakthrough

145
00:07:57,936 --> 00:07:59,897
at the Sage Grove Center.

146
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,482
It's a psychiatric hospital
in Pennsylvania.

147
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:04,109
Wait,
wh-what kind of breakthrough?

148
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:06,403
She came in
before I could see any more.

149
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:09,198
Well, we better have us

150
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,617
a little dekko
at this loony bin, eh, lads?

151
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:13,952
Starlight,

152
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:16,163
would you be amenable
to joining us

153
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:18,165
on this little caper?

154
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:19,917
You <i>want </i>her to come?

155
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,752
Oh, most definitely.

156
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:23,003
If shit goes sideways,

157
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:24,963
who do you think
Vought's gonna go after?

158
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:29,343
Us or their billion-dollar baby
turned traitor

159
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:31,929
who just ripped out
her own fucking chip?

160
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:36,058
Never go
into shark-infested waters

161
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,643
without chum.

162
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:48,946
<i>This is who I am.</i>

163
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:50,781
<i>Who are you?</i>

164
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:53,116
<i>Brave Maeve Pride Bars.</i>

165
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:56,119
<i>Because you can't be proud
on an empty stomach.</i>

166
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,165
Come in.

167
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,503
You fucking idiot.

168
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,673
You were supposed to call first.
Did anyone see you?

169
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,633
I'm allowed to visit my friends.

170
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:11,343
Did you find it?

171
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:13,971
No, sorry. No black box.

172
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:16,932
But I told
a couple of my contacts

173
00:09:16,974 --> 00:09:18,934
to keep an eye
on the North Atlantic Current.

174
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:20,602
So, this school of halibut...
I mean,

175
00:09:20,644 --> 00:09:22,354
these guys are, like, rowdy
motherfuckers, right? They...

176
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,231
Deep.

177
00:09:24,273 --> 00:09:27,484
Anyway,
they found some of the wreckage

178
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:29,194
that drifted up near Iceland.

179
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,280
And they found this.

180
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:37,160
I mean, I'm not sure
it still even works, but...

181
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:43,166
You want back in The Seven?

182
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,378
Not a fucking word of this
to anyone.

183
00:10:02,853 --> 00:10:04,438
Isn't it lit?

184
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,440
Your very own anthem.

185
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,110
Yeah, it's dope.

186
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:12,821
Well, this is just the demo,
of course.

187
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,699
We're going out to Lil Nas X
for the official version.

188
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:18,201
Maybe you could bust out
Prince's guitar for the video.

189
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,203
I had to sell Prince's guitar.

190
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:21,580
I'm going 10-1.

191
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,081
Okay.

192
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,333
Ashley.

193
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:25,876
- What?
- I can't find her.

194
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:28,170
Where the fuck is Starlight?

195
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:38,764
Yo! Here comes the A-Train.

196
00:10:38,805 --> 00:10:40,432
What, what?

197
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,434
I'm right here, buddy.
Over here.

198
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,436
- Yeah.
- What's up, buddy?

199
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,772
- Good to see you.
- What you doing here, man?

200
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:49,816
Oh, not much.
Just here to see, uh, uh...

201
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,860
No reason, really.

202
00:10:51,902 --> 00:10:54,654
But, hey, bro, I've been
thinking about you lately.

203
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,281
Yeah, I'm sorry.

204
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:59,159
I see what they're trying
to do to you. Yeah.

205
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:01,411
Talk about getting ass-fucked
with a soup can.

206
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:02,621
Am I right?

207
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,914
What do you mean?

208
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,540
I mean, come on.

209
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:08,126
If anyone knows what it's like
to get bounced, it's me.

210
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,462
Yeah. Did some shit
I'm not too proud of.

211
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:12,798
Some weird shit.

212
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,133
I'm good, man.

213
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,511
Nike and Under Armour are
already talking to my people,

214
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:18,970
so, you know,
this is actually gonna work out

215
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,390
to be really fantastic for me.

216
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,475
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

217
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:26,895
Yeah. Well, then, uh,
I guess you don't need his help.

218
00:11:26,937 --> 00:11:28,772
Or, uh... No, never mind.

219
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:30,190
Forget I even said anything.

220
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:33,193
But hey, it's great to see you,
man. Always.

221
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:34,778
All right.

222
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,072
Whose?

223
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:40,117
Whose help?

224
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,204
Would you like a Fresca?

225
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:59,302
Sage Grove, a proud subsidiary

226
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:01,221
of Global Wellness Services,
which is

227
00:12:01,263 --> 00:12:02,889
a subsidiary of...

228
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:04,599
I can guess.

229
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:06,893
Thanks.

230
00:12:07,894 --> 00:12:09,896
Here.

231
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:14,609
This is what you bought

232
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,987
with your blood money?

233
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:20,490
No one will believe you're
an orderly with that, you know.

234
00:12:27,873 --> 00:12:29,916
I should go in with them.

235
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:32,127
They can manage
without one bony, blonde Supe.

236
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:33,587
You just get them in

237
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:34,880
and get the fuck back, yeah?

238
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,882
Okay, just...

239
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:42,345
If anybody recognizes your face
in there, I mean...

240
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,354
Oi, Frenchie.

241
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:54,232
Don't get caught.

242
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,860
I never do.

243
00:13:06,161 --> 00:13:08,914
Weaponized Xanax.

244
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,626
The grenades
you used on Behemoth

245
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:14,085
during the bank heist.

246
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,464
You got a Supe
activated by rage,

247
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:18,840
so you simply take away
his rage,

248
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:20,258
turn him into a cupcake.

249
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,260
Clever.

250
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:26,264
I don't know what
you are talking about.

251
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,475
And Cold Snap two months ago?

252
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:30,101
Malchemical a month before that?

253
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:31,520
You don't know about those,
either?

254
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,981
What is this about?

255
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,317
Armed robbery,

256
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:38,485
breaking and entering,

257
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:39,861
aggravated assault on a Supe.

258
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:42,864
You're looking at 20 to 25,
minimum.

259
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:45,075
Or you can come work for me.

260
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:47,827
I could use someone
with your imagination.

261
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:50,664
Madame...

262
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,582
fuck you.

263
00:13:52,624 --> 00:13:55,210
That's a pity,

264
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:57,629
for you...

265
00:13:57,671 --> 00:14:01,049
...but even more so
for Cherie and Jay,

266
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:03,093
I believe?

267
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:08,265
ADX Florence

268
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:10,475
is a supermax in Colorado.

269
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,519
They've got the Unabomber,
head of the Aryan Brotherhood...

270
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:13,687
all the greats.

271
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,897
And your friends, too.
Maybe.

272
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:19,317
Or... they go free.

273
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,403
But that depends on you.

274
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,029
Right now.

275
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:25,031
You can't do that.

276
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,834
Wait.

277
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:43,300
What kind of work do you do?

278
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:50,181
Hey.

279
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:53,101
Um...

280
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:55,312
Come into my trailer
for a second.

281
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:57,689
I have a surprise for you.

282
00:14:57,731 --> 00:14:59,608
I have to stop by Vought Tower,

283
00:14:59,649 --> 00:15:01,359
see my social guys.

284
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:03,361
No.

285
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,362
Come on. Blow them off.

286
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:05,447
Come.

287
00:15:05,488 --> 00:15:07,866
I will be back in 20 minutes.

288
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,493
And then...

289
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:13,913
I'll let you surprise me
wherever you want.

290
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,957
Ooh.

291
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:23,757
Yeah, okay.

292
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,767
You see 'em?

293
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:16,935
Yeah.

294
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,687
I see 'em.

295
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:01,396
Get in.

296
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:28,798
Here.

297
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:34,304
Seriously?

298
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:36,890
What is your problem with me?

299
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:38,725
I ain't got no problem with you,
love.

300
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:40,602
Really? That's why
you won't even touch my hand?

301
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:41,853
Okay, guys, come on.
Not the time.

302
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:43,104
You know what? No.

303
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:44,773
I think
it's exactly the right time.

304
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,025
I think the time
is long overdue.

305
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,694
You know that I hate Vought
as much as you do.

306
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:51,905
You know that. But it
doesn't even matter to you

307
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:55,742
because what you can't stand
is in my blood.

308
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:57,494
I'm subhuman to you.

309
00:17:57,535 --> 00:17:59,954
Only good Supe is a dead Supe,
right?

310
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,706
Your words, not mine.

311
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:02,791
That's enough.

312
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,042
You know what?

313
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,044
Underneath all that swagger,

314
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,464
you're just a bigot and a bully.

315
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:11,216
I know another guy
just like that.

316
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:12,717
He's got a flag for a cape.

317
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:15,428
Annie, stop.

318
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:36,783
Oh, fuck me.

319
00:18:36,825 --> 00:18:38,493
Hughie, call them. Now.

320
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:44,249
Open the door.
We need help.

321
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,959
I have a patient
that needs help.

322
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:46,960
Hurry up! Please!

323
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:47,961
What's wrong with him?

324
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:48,962
Just open the goddamn door!

325
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,922
He's swallowing
his fucking tongue!

326
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:56,302
- What's wrong with him?
- Easy.

327
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:15,947
Holy fuck.

328
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:33,172
What the fuck is all of this?

329
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:36,092
Vought is making
more Supe terrorists?

330
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:38,219
Who the fuck knows?

331
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:42,599
Goddamn.

332
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,642
Brother's got a love sausage.

333
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:12,879
Stormfront is here?

334
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:16,132
<i>How you doing today?</i>

335
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:21,220
<i>Do you want to show us a little
of what you've been working on?</i>

336
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:24,057
Hey. Hey.

337
00:20:24,098 --> 00:20:26,100
You're okay.

338
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:29,270
You're all right.

339
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:31,314
It's okay.

340
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:36,653
<i>That is very impressive, Tim.</i>

341
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:39,072
That orderly Stormfront's with...

342
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:41,741
he look familiar to you?

343
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:43,326
<i>Je ne sais pas.</i>

344
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:44,494
<i>What about headaches?</i>

345
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,245
<i>Nausea?</i>

346
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:47,914
<i>No.</i>

347
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:51,084
Well, that's promising.

348
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,253
I think we are getting close.

349
00:20:54,295 --> 00:20:56,631
Ma'am,

350
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:59,258
can I go home now?

351
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,219
I want to see my family.

352
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,429
<i>Tim,
you were admitted to Sage Grove</i>

353
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:05,807
<i>because you're suicidal.</i>

354
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:07,850
You could be a danger
to yourself.

355
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:09,769
Well, I'm not doing any more
of these stupid pet tricks

356
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:11,396
until I talk to my sister.

357
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:15,858
Okay. Okay.

358
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,152
We'll work something out.

359
00:21:43,678 --> 00:21:45,221
Lamplighter.

360
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:48,224
- That's fucking Lamplighter.
- Shh...

361
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:50,393
I didn't recognize
him without the mask and the hood.

362
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:53,312
- Fucking Lamplighter. We have to kill him, of course.
- No, no, no, no. No, we can't.

363
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:56,482
- For Madame Mallory. For her grandchildren.
- Not right now.

364
00:21:56,524 --> 00:22:00,278
First, we got to find out
what the fuck all this shit is.

365
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,947
- Come on.
- Listen, listen.

366
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:05,241
Stick to the plan, Frenchie.

367
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:17,295
- Hughie.
<i>- There you are.</i>

368
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,838
<i>You guys okay?
Stormfront's in there.</i>

369
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,423
That ain't all who's here.

370
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,763
Okay, okay. She just left.
Get the hell out. Now.

371
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:29,098
All right, let's get
the fuck out of here.

372
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:15,937
Hey. Cindy.

373
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,191
Let's be cool.

374
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:21,526
Okay?

375
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,320
You remember that extra helping

376
00:23:24,362 --> 00:23:27,448
of Kraft Shells & Cheese
that I snuck you?

377
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:31,911
I like you.

378
00:23:31,953 --> 00:23:33,287
You know that, right?

379
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:37,041
Who are your friends?

380
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,043
We ain't his friends.

381
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:41,045
Go ahead.
Fuck his ass up.

382
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:43,548
You're dressed like his friends.

383
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,424
I don't like liars.

384
00:23:56,686 --> 00:23:58,688
Oh, shit...

385
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,358
Let's get out of here!

386
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,503
Hey. Let go!

387
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:27,592
Stay the fuck back or I will
burn your skin off, asshole!

388
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:28,759
Oh, you won't get the chance!

389
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:31,095
Someone help me!

390
00:24:44,901 --> 00:24:48,237
All right, listen up, man.

391
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:50,406
You can burn us,

392
00:24:50,448 --> 00:24:52,033
but she's a Supe.

393
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:54,368
All you're gonna do
is piss her off.

394
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,370
So why don't
we all just calm down

395
00:24:56,412 --> 00:24:58,372
and live
through this motherfucker?

396
00:25:04,629 --> 00:25:06,756
- What's going on here?
- It's a lockdown.

397
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:08,007
No one's getting out of here,
not even her.

398
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:09,383
There's got to be
an access code.

399
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:10,843
There is,
genius, at the front door.

400
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:12,136
And there is no <i>fucking </i>way

401
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:14,347
I am telling you
or taking you with me.

402
00:25:14,388 --> 00:25:16,224
You do realize there's a whole
army of Supes on the other side

403
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:18,476
of that door that want
to tear you apart, right?

404
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:22,063
She... can help.

405
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,153
I'm gonna take my chances.

406
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:59,058
Okay, you guys can come.

407
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:06,357
What the fuck?

408
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:13,614
Come on, M.M.

409
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:15,449
Pick up, damn you.

410
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,451
<i>Your call has been forwarded</i>

411
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:19,245
<i>to an automated
voice messaging system.</i>

412
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:20,663
<i>Marvin.</i>

413
00:26:20,705 --> 00:26:22,039

</i>- Oh, hello.

414

<i>At the tone,
please record your message.</i>

415
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:25,584
Easy does it, lad.

416
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:27,003
No trouble from us.

417
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:29,338
You just stroll on by, yeah?

418
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:33,634
I don't want them
to hurt me again.

419
00:26:38,889 --> 00:26:41,600
Oh, nah.
N-No one's gonna hurt you, son.

420
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:45,479
Uh... we're all friends here,
aren't we?

421
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:23,184
Hughie.

422
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,982
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

423
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:33,235
Fine. Uh...

424
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:35,821
- Hughie? Hughie?
- Oh, shit.

425
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:38,866
Hughie!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No.

426
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:40,576
Can you cauterize it?

427
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:45,122
fuck. The kid must have fried everything.

428
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,665
- I need power.
- Well, you got

429
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:48,334
a pretty shite superpower then,
don't you?

430
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:50,002
We got to get him to a doctor.

431
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:52,213
- C... Where, how?
- I don't know, but not gonna

432
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:54,006
just sit here and watch him
fucking well bleed out!

433
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:55,383
- All right?!
- Okay! Okay, okay, okay.

434
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:57,593
Come on. - Come on.

435
00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:59,428
What about the others?

436
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,888
They're on their own.

437
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,675
Ashley? Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

438
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,177
Don't you dare tell me
you haven't found Starlight yet.

439
00:28:42,096 --> 00:28:44,014
Here.

440
00:28:55,985 --> 00:28:57,736
I've been searching everywhere
for you.

441
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,697
What happened to your trailer?

442
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,824
Electrical fire.

443
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:03,868
How was your meeting?

444
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,829
Sorry. It ran long.

445
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:09,248
No need to apologize.

446
00:29:16,005 --> 00:29:18,799
All right, well, I got
to go run lines with Noir.

447
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:21,719
Scene 48 tonight.
Real megillah.

448
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,304
Something wrong?

449
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:24,930
No. Nothing.

450
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:26,515
You sure?

451
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:28,851
Why would anything be wrong?

452
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:34,690
By the way, I went to the Tower,

453
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:36,692
and, uh, you weren't there.

454
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:39,153
No one had seen you.

455
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:41,071
So you're checking on me?

456
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,034
Wanted to see
how your meeting went.

457
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,621
Hold on.

458
00:29:48,662 --> 00:29:50,664
- Let me...
- Explain?

459
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:55,085
Come on now.

460
00:29:55,127 --> 00:29:58,380
Why would you need
to explain anything to me?

461
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:24,740
Deep, your numbers among women

462
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:26,867
have been ticking up
quite nicely.

463
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:28,869
Did you catch
Malala Yousafzai's tweet?

464
00:30:28,911 --> 00:30:30,412
Called you "a sweetheart."

465
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:32,581
Well, she's the sweetheart.

466
00:30:34,750 --> 00:30:37,253
So, what's on your mind,
A-Train?

467
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:40,297
Hmm. Um...

468
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:44,051
Deep invited me here,
so, you know...

469
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:46,053
Yeah, I don't know.

470
00:30:46,095 --> 00:30:48,389
Just having a really nice lunch,
I guess, here.

471
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:51,559
And Deep, what's on your mind?

472
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,770
Well, I think A-Train
sabotaged me my entire career.

473
00:30:54,812 --> 00:30:57,356
- What?!
- Well, you do think you're better than me.

474
00:30:57,398 --> 00:30:59,024
You know, I fantasize about

475
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:01,193
drowning you
over and over again.

476
00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:03,279
But I mean, I don't want
to feel that way anymore.

477
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,906
I want to be clean.

478
00:31:05,948 --> 00:31:07,866
Oh, boy.

479
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:11,203
Looks like we got ourselves
a good old Truth Exchange.

480
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:14,957
- Oh, hell, no.
- Please sit down.

481
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:17,876
No. Look, man, I seen
that documentary about you guys.

482
00:31:17,918 --> 00:31:19,253
It's not my type of shit.

483
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:20,879
For a man in seven-figure debt,

484
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:22,798
a heart condition,
and in heavy withdrawal,

485
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,843
do you really think you have
the luxury to get up and leave?

486
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:34,810
Who told you that?

487
00:31:34,852 --> 00:31:37,563
Huh? Did he fucking
tell you that shit?

488
00:31:37,605 --> 00:31:40,816
No. The church knows
all kinds of things.

489
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:42,818
But don't worry.
We also know how to be discreet,

490
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,278
especially for our members.

491
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:49,325
They're gonna give Shockwave
your uniform, you know that?

492
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:51,910
- Call him the next A-Train.
- No, they can't do that.

493
00:31:51,952 --> 00:31:53,412
Why not?

494
00:31:53,454 --> 00:31:55,164
"A-Train" is a trademark.

495
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:57,833
You are just another nobody
from the South Side of Chicago.

496
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:00,961
Man, fuck you, man!

497
00:32:01,003 --> 00:32:02,755
I can help.

498
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:04,798
I can get you back in.

499
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:09,511
But first... sit down.

500
00:32:30,324 --> 00:32:31,867
Come on. In here.

501
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,883
It's beautiful.

502
00:32:51,762 --> 00:32:55,933
Hey, what the hell is
going on here? Huh?

503
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,352
You all are juicing people
with motherfucking Compound V,

504
00:32:58,394 --> 00:33:00,604
only to burn 'em alive? Why?

505
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:02,690
Maybe I just like
watching people burn.

506
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,779
I remember you, you know.

507
00:33:10,698 --> 00:33:13,992
You were tailing me the night
that I torched those kids.

508
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:17,538
So why didn't you stop me?

509
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:22,710
Maybe you like
watching people burn, too.

510
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:24,753
<i>File de pute!</i>

511
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:26,672
No, no, no, no, no!

512
00:33:26,714 --> 00:33:30,592
Easy! Easy! Easy...

513
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:38,851
Easy... Come on, man.

514
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:55,868
<i>Mon Dieu.</i>

515
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:57,369
And I don't want
to hear no bullshit

516
00:33:57,411 --> 00:33:59,037
about I'm gonna getting tired
of the pussy.

517
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,873
I love this girl.

518
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:02,458
Like, this is the one.

519
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:09,757
All right, brother.
All right.

520
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,425
- All right. All right.
- Congratulations, Marvin.

521
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:13,677
Thank you, Colonel.
Check it out.

522
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,471
It's beautiful.

523
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:18,098
Oh, the bachelor party
I will throw you.

524
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:21,185
What's your thoughts
about transgender strippers?

525
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,687
Strippers ain't really
my kind of Hershey's,

526
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:26,648
with or without nuts,
but you golf?

527
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:28,692
Thinking about doing
a golf trip.

528
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:31,570
Oi.

529
00:35:00,349 --> 00:35:02,893
What?

530
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:05,062
And what the fuck
are you laughing at?

531
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,897
Sorry, mate.

532
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:10,067
You just look like one of them
poncy baton twirlers.

533
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,527
- A majorette.
- That's right.

534
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:13,779
A fucking majorette.

535
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:26,834
You look good in these.

536
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:31,213
So here's what happens now.

537
00:35:31,255 --> 00:35:33,966
You're gonna tell us
every single thing

538
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:36,051
you see and hear at the Tower.

539
00:35:36,093 --> 00:35:39,263
Especially when it comes
to Homelander.

540
00:35:46,186 --> 00:35:49,648
Please don't pretend
like you have a choice.

541
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:53,694
I look forward to your call.

542
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:08,792
Easy peasy.

543
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,335
I don't like it.

544
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:12,921
You don't back an animal
like that into a corner.

545
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:14,840
Fuck him.

546
00:36:14,882 --> 00:36:17,134
We own the cunt.

547
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,594
Frenchie?

548
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:22,556
Don't let him out of your sight.

549
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:24,600
<i>Oui, Madame.</i>

550
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:37,404
Hey, what's the trouble, miss?

551
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:39,448
Sir, I need you
to get out of your car.

552
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:41,366
Well,
what are you talking about?

553
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:51,668
Need to commandeer your vehicle.

554
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,337
- Bit of an emergency.
- Jesus.

555
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,380
- What happened to him?
- Long story, that.

556
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:58,258
- Uh, can I see some ID?
- Left it in me other pants.

557
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,678
Too busy saving this one,
but you can call my boss.

558
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:04,264
Yeah, okay. Uh, look, I'll...
I can get you... get you guys

559
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:06,266
to the hospital, but we're out
in the middle of nowhere.

560
00:37:06,308 --> 00:37:07,726
I'm not gonna give you my car.

561
00:37:07,768 --> 00:37:10,646
Have it your way.

562
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,273
Butcher?

563
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,026
Butcher?

564
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:18,153
Don't.

565
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:24,660
- Stay back.
- Whoa! Okay.

566
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:26,495
- I said, stay back.
- That's not necessary.

567
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:27,996
- Let's just talk.
- The FBI?

568
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:29,498
Yeah, really.
You're not even American.

569
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:31,208
What, is-is he even hurt?

570
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,502
What is this?
Some kind of a scam?

571
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:37,756
If I wanted
to boost some wheels,

572
00:37:37,798 --> 00:37:40,676
it wouldn't be a fuckin'
Hyundai, you daft cunt.

573
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:42,803
This is a stand-your-ground
state. You stay back!

574
00:37:42,844 --> 00:37:45,263
Oh, you can stand
wherever the fuck you want.

575
00:37:45,305 --> 00:37:47,641
- I'm taking your keys.
- Butcher, stop.

576
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:50,102
Buddy, just put the gun down.

577
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:52,354
- I said stay back.
- I said... put it down!

578
00:38:20,257 --> 00:38:23,635
You couldn't just listen to me
and stay back?!

579
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,148
Come on.

580
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:38,191
Cauterize it!

581
00:38:55,292 --> 00:38:56,668
It won't hold long.

582
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,670
Come on.

583
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:31,495
Is this the right time
to go shopping?

584
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:32,704
One, why not?

585
00:39:32,746 --> 00:39:35,499
And <i>deux...</i>

586
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,375
this is good news.

587
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:39,419
What do you mean by that?

588
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:44,800
Some aerated propofol...

589
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:48,512
some other odds and ends,
I'll make a knockout bomb.

590
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,639
Even for Supes.

591
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,434
Okay.

592
00:40:01,233 --> 00:40:03,235
Why are we still alive?

593
00:40:04,528 --> 00:40:07,197
- Dumb luck?
- No.

594
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:08,824
I mean that night.

595
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:11,284
We went underground for months.

596
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:15,956
But you never came for us.

597
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:18,083
Not you, not Homelander.

598
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:19,501
Why?

599
00:40:19,543 --> 00:40:21,628
You're disappointed
we didn't kill you?

600
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:24,840
I thought The Seven
always retaliates, no?

601
00:40:24,881 --> 00:40:26,800
You're nobody.

602
00:40:26,842 --> 00:40:28,468
Not worth it.

603
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:38,603
You didn't tell them, did you?

604
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:44,234
Why wouldn't you tell them?

605
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:45,652
Who says I didn't?

606
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:47,737
I figured you'd boast about it

607
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:50,407
to Homelander,
must've been thrilling for you.

608
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,325
I'm not a fucking animal.

609
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:55,120
Only a fucking
animal would do what you did.

610
00:40:55,162 --> 00:40:56,538
Drop it.

611
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,957
- You murdered innocent children.
- Shut the fuck up.

612
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:01,501
You watched them burn alive,
crying for their mama.

613
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:04,421
If that's not an animal,
then what is, huh?

614
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,423
I didn't know!

615
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:14,598
I didn't know they were
gonna be in that bed.

616
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:17,309
It was supposed to be your boss.

617
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:27,944
Then they started screaming.

618
00:41:34,868 --> 00:41:37,412
But it was too late.

619
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:42,209
So what, are we supposed
to feel bad for you now?

620
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,835
Fuck you.

621
00:41:43,877 --> 00:41:45,462
I don't want anything from you.

622
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:46,796
But you...

623
00:41:48,215 --> 00:41:50,884
I saw you following me
that night.

624
00:41:52,761 --> 00:41:56,223
And then you disappeared.

625
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:59,309
I keep asking myself, why...

626
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:02,479
why didn't you stop me?

627
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:10,946
Why didn't you?

628
00:42:10,987 --> 00:42:13,406
Good question.

629
00:42:25,502 --> 00:42:27,087
All right, all right.

630
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:39,474
Cherie, this is not...

631
00:42:39,516 --> 00:42:40,892
<i>He's dying!</i>

632
00:42:40,934 --> 00:42:42,936
<i>- Quoi?
- Jay!</i>

633
00:42:42,978 --> 00:42:44,020
He's ODing.

634
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:45,689
I-I don't know what he took.

635
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,065
- Take him to the hospital!
<i>- Please, come now!</i>

636
00:42:47,107 --> 00:42:48,817
<i>Come!</i>

637
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:54,197
Serge, you fucking come
right now.

638
00:42:55,991 --> 00:42:57,033
Cherie!

639
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:59,077
Hello...

640
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,341
No.

641
00:43:13,383 --> 00:43:14,551
Come on!

642
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:17,595
Come on, <i>mon ami!</i>

643
00:43:23,435 --> 00:43:25,312
Look at me, look at me,
you went out.

644
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:26,896
Okay, can you sit?

645
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:28,356
Come on!

646
00:43:28,398 --> 00:43:29,941
Come on, <i>mon ami, </i>come on.

647
00:43:32,193 --> 00:43:33,320
He's okay.

648
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:35,655
Okay, you stay with him.

649
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:37,657
- You keep him talking, okay?
- What?

650
00:43:39,034 --> 00:43:40,118
Where are you going?

651
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,536
Don't let him fall asleep.

652
00:43:41,578 --> 00:43:43,038
- What...?
- I told you I have something.

653
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:44,456
Something more important
than this?

654
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:45,707
More important than <i>us?</i>

655
00:43:45,749 --> 00:43:47,792
Cherie, I cannot
do this right now.

656
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:50,253
Okay?

657
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:53,381
Please, stay with him!

658
00:43:53,423 --> 00:43:55,091
Fine, you want to go...

659
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:56,885
go.

660
00:43:56,926 --> 00:43:59,763
We don't give a shit.

661
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:02,223
Serge?

662
00:44:12,442 --> 00:44:14,444
I'll be back.

663
00:44:19,324 --> 00:44:21,326
<i>Je te promets.</i>

664
00:44:23,036 --> 00:44:25,872
He's burning up.

665
00:44:25,914 --> 00:44:27,540
I'm going as fast as I can.

666
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:34,214
I appreciate
what you done back there.

667
00:44:34,255 --> 00:44:35,632
Oh, thanks.

668
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,634
Your approval means
everything to me.

669
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,594
And some sarcasm
to stick the landing.

670
00:44:39,636 --> 00:44:40,678
Nice one.

671
00:44:43,098 --> 00:44:44,724
You didn't have a choice.

672
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:51,272
You know what I was thinking,
when I was looking at him?

673
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:57,278
"Why'd you pull a gun,
you stupid fuck?"

674
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:59,697
That's all.

675
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:05,578
Maybe once I would've
cried over him, but...

676
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:09,249
now he was just another
person in our way.

677
00:45:15,547 --> 00:45:16,840
No.

678
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:18,758
- No what?
- No to that

679
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,429
fucking look of quiet respect

680
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,389
or approval or whatever that is.

681
00:45:24,431 --> 00:45:26,599
I don't want it.

682
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:31,729
We're nothing alike.

683
00:45:31,771 --> 00:45:33,773
Nothing.

684
00:45:48,204 --> 00:45:51,082
You really think
that's gonna work?

685
00:45:52,125 --> 00:45:53,460
I think so.

686
00:46:02,469 --> 00:46:04,721
You know, they're not
trying to make Supes here.

687
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,598
These people are test subjects.

688
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:08,266
They're trying
to stabilize the V.

689
00:46:08,308 --> 00:46:09,642
Explain.

690
00:46:09,684 --> 00:46:12,187
Infants handle it best,
but adults?

691
00:46:12,228 --> 00:46:14,189
I mean, you saw what happens...
sometimes you get powers,

692
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:16,816
sometimes you get a freak,
sometimes you just explode.

693
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:19,319
Vought is trying
to stabilize it,

694
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,571
so that you put the V
in any adult arm,

695
00:46:21,613 --> 00:46:24,782
anywhere, anytime, you get
a solid Supe, solid powers.

696
00:46:24,824 --> 00:46:27,160
<i>Putain.</i>

697
00:46:27,202 --> 00:46:29,621
Okay, so...

698
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:32,790
a thousand more Supes...
100,000?

699
00:46:32,832 --> 00:46:34,709
Why? Why would Vought do that?

700
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,503
It's gonna fuck up their movies,
their merchandising...

701
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:38,838
They don't tell me.

702
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:42,342
They just make me
burn the evidence.

703
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:44,928
Okay?

704
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:58,983
My, uh...

705
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:01,444
my best friend.

706
00:47:01,486 --> 00:47:04,239
OD'd and I left

707
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,699
to save him that night.

708
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:10,328
Why I didn't stop you.

709
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:12,455
You were at a party.

710
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:14,958
I was away for 30 minutes.

711
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:17,919
Came back, you were gone.

712
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:23,800
Did he live?

713
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,843
Your friend?

714
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:30,390
<i>Oui.</i>

715
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:34,102
But I never saw him again,
and...

716
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:36,521
then, uh, he died
a few months later.

717
00:47:36,563 --> 00:47:38,147
Another overdose.

718
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:39,482
Are you serious?

719
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:41,359
Frenchie, wh...?

720
00:47:41,401 --> 00:47:43,653
Why didn't you ever tell us?

721
00:47:43,695 --> 00:47:46,614
What difference would it make?

722
00:47:46,656 --> 00:47:48,825
After all these years, man?

723
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:51,995
We would've let you
off the hook.

724
00:47:56,165 --> 00:48:00,336
What makes you think I want
to be let off the hook, huh?

725
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:21,357
Get it off me!

726
00:48:21,399 --> 00:48:22,900
Get this thing off of me!

727
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,506
Was that...?

728
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:47,467
It's okay.

729
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:50,386
That's his fucking dick.

730
00:48:50,428 --> 00:48:53,056
Don't be so closed-minded.

731
00:49:22,752 --> 00:49:24,212
I thought you said that shit
was gonna work.

732
00:49:24,253 --> 00:49:25,588
I said I <i>thought </i>it would.

733
00:49:43,690 --> 00:49:45,108
Lamplighter?!

734
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:51,489
Lamplighter!

735
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:58,496
I'm here.

736
00:50:07,422 --> 00:50:11,008
I just killed
six subjects out there

737
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:13,636
like a fucking
teddy bear picnic.

738
00:50:13,678 --> 00:50:16,139
What the hell happened?

739
00:50:20,476 --> 00:50:23,688
Dr. Carlton got
the propofol dose

740
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:25,481
wrong again.

741
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:28,276
So Cindy got loose,
freed some of the others.

742
00:50:28,317 --> 00:50:30,278
I'm sure some of them got out
before lockdown.

743
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:31,696
Where's Dr. Carlton?

744
00:50:31,738 --> 00:50:33,948
Uh, he's in the cafeteria

745
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:36,200
and the hallway and...

746
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:38,077
some of the walls.

747
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:47,044
Clean up this mess.

748
00:50:47,086 --> 00:50:50,089
I'm gonna go see
if anyone else got loose.

749
00:50:50,131 --> 00:50:52,550
Yes, ma'am.

750
00:51:05,897 --> 00:51:07,690
We need help!

751
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:19,702
What'd they say?

752
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:23,998
Just needs a couple of days for
the Cefazolin to kick in, but...

753
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,416
he should be all right.

754
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:27,210
We don't have a couple of days.

755
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:29,587
Well, we're gonna have
to risk it.

756
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:42,850
Jesus.

757
00:51:43,893 --> 00:51:45,019
What?

758
00:51:45,061 --> 00:51:46,270
Just...

759
00:51:46,312 --> 00:51:48,648
it's the kids' shampoo he uses.

760
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:50,483
I can smell it.

761
00:51:50,525 --> 00:51:53,528
L'Oréal for kids,
strawberry smoothie.

762
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:55,446
I seen the bottle.

763
00:51:55,488 --> 00:51:57,740
Hateful shit.

764
00:51:57,782 --> 00:52:00,576
And his Axe Body Spray.

765
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:02,453
Ugh! I mean...

766
00:52:02,495 --> 00:52:04,914
that's how Vin Diesel
must smell.

767
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:10,002
You know, every morning
he slathers his bum

768
00:52:10,044 --> 00:52:11,879
- with creamy Desitin.
- No.

769
00:52:11,921 --> 00:52:14,465
I fucking swear to God.
He's got rashes down there.

770
00:52:14,507 --> 00:52:16,551
I don't want to know that!

771
00:52:16,592 --> 00:52:19,637
Fucking mental,
that's all I'm saying.

772
00:52:24,642 --> 00:52:27,270
But he really just...

773
00:52:27,311 --> 00:52:30,606
never gives up on you, does he?

774
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:32,149
Aye.

775
00:52:32,191 --> 00:52:36,112
And he follows you around
like a right little pup.

776
00:52:38,948 --> 00:52:42,410
He's too good for either of us.

777
00:52:44,954 --> 00:52:47,665
Yeah.

778
00:52:49,834 --> 00:52:51,377
<i>I'm gonna Postmate Sugarfish.</i>

779
00:52:52,420 --> 00:52:53,796
What?

780
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:55,381
I'm gonna Postmate Sugarfish.

781
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:56,883
- Where's your phone?
- I can't hear you.

782
00:52:56,924 --> 00:52:58,676
Where's...?

783
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:22,241
<i>Homelander and Queen Maeve.</i>

784
00:53:22,283 --> 00:53:24,160
<i>Oh, my God, they're leaving us.</i>

785
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:28,414
<i>- What's gonna happen?
- It's okay, everybody.</i>

786
00:53:28,456 --> 00:53:29,624
<i>- It's okay.
</i>- Hey,

787
00:53:29,665 --> 00:53:31,918
did you say Sugarfish?

788
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:35,504
<i>Please save us!</i>

789
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:37,757
<i>- Take these two!
- No, no.</i>

790
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:39,967
<i>- Just these two! Please!
- No! What, so they can tell</i>

791
00:53:40,009 --> 00:53:42,470
<i>the world we left the rest
of them to fucking die?</i>

792
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:43,971
<i>- No.
</i>- Elena.

793
00:53:44,013 --> 00:53:46,891
<i>- Take my daughter!
- Help us!</i>

794
00:53:46,933 --> 00:53:48,309
<i>- You got to help us!
- Don't leave us!</i>

795
00:53:48,351 --> 00:53:49,727
<i>Please!</i>

796
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:52,980
<i>I love you.</i>

797
00:53:53,022 --> 00:53:55,566
<i>Tell the boys I love them.</i>

798
00:53:57,026 --> 00:53:59,695
I'm gonna show that
to Homelander.

799
00:54:01,364 --> 00:54:02,990
And...

800
00:54:03,032 --> 00:54:05,993
he's either gonna leave us alone

801
00:54:06,035 --> 00:54:08,287
or I'm gonna put it on CNN.

802
00:54:15,127 --> 00:54:16,253
Elena.

803
00:54:16,295 --> 00:54:18,631
This is our out.

804
00:54:22,051 --> 00:54:24,470
I was scared. I...

805
00:54:28,891 --> 00:54:30,434
I know
I should have stood up to him.

806
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:32,019
I know that.

807
00:54:32,061 --> 00:54:36,065
Elena, I watched
a plane full of people die.

808
00:54:42,488 --> 00:54:45,449
Why are you looking at me
like that?

809
00:54:48,911 --> 00:54:51,122
Yeah. Right.

810
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:52,206
Yo.

811
00:54:52,248 --> 00:54:54,417
Close stitch, but Hughie's okay.

812
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:55,584
Oh, <i>bien.</i>

813
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:57,169
Hey,

814
00:54:57,211 --> 00:54:59,755
tell Butcher about the thick
penis around your neck.

815
00:54:59,797 --> 00:55:01,173
Fuck you.

816
00:55:01,215 --> 00:55:03,843
Nah, nah, nah, it's just
Frenchie being Frenchie.

817
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:16,522
I am sorry.

818
00:55:19,942 --> 00:55:22,903
For a long time,

819
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:26,866
I was trying to save you.

820
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:29,702
I thought, uh,

821
00:55:29,744 --> 00:55:31,454
if I did, somehow,

822
00:55:31,495 --> 00:55:35,791
that would make up
for the things I've done.

823
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:41,130
You never asked to be saved.

824
00:55:43,424 --> 00:55:47,303
You cannot absolve my, uh, sins.

825
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:50,389
No one can.

826
00:55:50,431 --> 00:55:53,142
I know this now.

827
00:55:53,184 --> 00:55:56,353
So...

828
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:58,314
I leave you alone.

829
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,082
Got to go.

830
00:56:25,174 --> 00:56:27,384
Colonel.

831
00:56:27,426 --> 00:56:28,886
Marvin,

832
00:56:28,928 --> 00:56:31,138
where is he?

833
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:33,182
This way.

834
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:38,104
Madame Mallory.

835
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:41,107
Uh, I know I wasn't welcome
at the funeral,

836
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:44,318
so, all these years, I
couldn't offer my condolences...

837
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,403
Where is he?

838
00:56:53,244 --> 00:56:55,204
Why isn't this man restrained?

839
00:56:55,246 --> 00:56:56,622
No need. I wanted to come.

840
00:56:56,664 --> 00:57:00,209
I don't want to hear
a single goddamn word from you.

841
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:06,882
I thought this was behind me.

842
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:08,926
But it's not.

843
00:57:10,886 --> 00:57:13,180
It never is.

844
00:57:13,222 --> 00:57:15,975
Then let's both be done with it.

845
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:21,605
I know what you have to do.

846
00:57:23,983 --> 00:57:25,860
Do it.

847
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:27,862
You'd be doing me a favor.

848
00:57:27,903 --> 00:57:29,321
Do it.

849
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:33,159
Madame, please.

850
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,619
If I may?

851
00:57:36,871 --> 00:57:38,247
Besides you,

852
00:57:38,289 --> 00:57:40,332
no one wanted him dead more
than me,

853
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:42,585
but I am begging you
for his life.

854
00:57:48,924 --> 00:57:51,677
I have no choice.

855
00:57:52,887 --> 00:57:55,848
It won't help you.

856
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:59,560
All you'd be doing
is ending his torment.

857
00:58:03,355 --> 00:58:06,984
You cannot punish him
as much as he punishes himself.

858
00:58:09,737 --> 00:58:12,031
Trust me.

859
00:58:15,534 --> 00:58:17,286
So...

860
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:21,707
...what exactly

861
00:58:21,749 --> 00:58:25,252
are you proposing we do
with him?

862
00:58:32,593 --> 00:58:34,261
Hey.

863
00:58:35,596 --> 00:58:37,389
I'm so glad you're here.

864
00:58:37,431 --> 00:58:38,807
I want to apologize.

865
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:40,309
Please, just let me explain.

866
00:58:40,351 --> 00:58:44,855
Flap, flap, flap
goes that little mouth of yours.

867
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:50,694
You remember you told me
that you don't break easily?

868
00:58:52,112 --> 00:58:54,782
Well, I've been thinking
about that.

869
00:58:57,326 --> 00:58:59,161
A lot.

870
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:03,165
I will never lie to you again.

871
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:05,918
I will tell you everything.

872
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:14,385
Starting with this.

873
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:39,243
Your grandmother?

874
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,830
My daughter.

875
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:49,628
Chloe. She died of Alzheimer's
a few years ago.

876
00:59:51,964 --> 00:59:53,507
How old are you?

877
00:59:53,549 --> 00:59:56,593
I was born in 1919.

878
00:59:56,635 --> 00:59:58,137
In Berlin.

879
01:00:10,441 --> 01:00:12,526
Is that you with...?

880
01:00:12,568 --> 01:00:14,528
Heinrich Himmler.

881
01:00:14,570 --> 01:00:16,447
He was a lovely dancer.

882
01:00:16,488 --> 01:00:18,824
And that's Goebbels.

883
01:00:18,866 --> 01:00:20,576
And...

884
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:23,954
the most important man
in the room...

885
01:00:35,174 --> 01:00:37,634
Frederick Vought.

886
01:00:39,928 --> 01:00:44,016
He gave me the first successful
V injection.

887
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:47,227
He taught me everything.

888
01:00:48,604 --> 01:00:49,980
And then we fell in love,

889
01:00:50,022 --> 01:00:51,315
and he gave me a daughter.

890
01:00:51,357 --> 01:00:53,942
He made me,

891
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:57,404
and his genius made you.

892
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:10,584
Frederick didn't care
about all the fans or stardom

893
01:01:10,626 --> 01:01:13,587
or any of that shallow bullshit.

894
01:01:13,629 --> 01:01:17,508
We are in a war for the culture.

895
01:01:17,549 --> 01:01:20,511
The other races
are grinding us down

896
01:01:20,552 --> 01:01:22,346
and taking
what is rightfully ours,

897
01:01:22,388 --> 01:01:24,765
but we can fight back.

898
01:01:24,807 --> 01:01:26,934
With an army of supermen,

899
01:01:26,975 --> 01:01:29,269
millions strong.

900
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:33,023
Because that is
Vought's true destiny.

901
01:01:33,065 --> 01:01:37,903
And <i>you </i>will be the man
who will lead us.

902
01:01:42,616 --> 01:01:47,454
You are everything
that we dreamed of.

903
01:01:50,249 --> 01:01:53,919
So I love you
with all of my heart.

904
01:01:55,003 --> 01:01:57,673
How could I not?

905
01:02:03,011 --> 01:02:06,640
Everyone I have ever loved
is in the ground.

906
01:02:06,682 --> 01:02:09,435
And then I found you.

907
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,980
We found each other.

908
01:02:14,356 --> 01:02:16,358
And now neither of us

909
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,777
has to be alone ever again.

910
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,281
And that...

911
01:02:22,322 --> 01:02:24,908
is the truth.
