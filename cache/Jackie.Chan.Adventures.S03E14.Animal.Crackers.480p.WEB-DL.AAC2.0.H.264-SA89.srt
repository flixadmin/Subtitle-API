1
00:00:02,168 --> 00:00:03,802
Uncle: Push, tohru!

2
00:00:03,804 --> 00:00:05,004
(Grunting)

3
00:00:05,006 --> 00:00:07,206
Push!

4
00:00:07,208 --> 00:00:10,309
Uncle,
unlike the ox,

5
00:00:10,311 --> 00:00:13,145
tohru does not
have super strength.

6
00:00:13,147 --> 00:00:15,481
Then help tohru push!

7
00:00:17,917 --> 00:00:19,218
We must leave quickly

8
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,921
before daolon wong's
warriors return for the ox.

9
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,925
Maybe this will
speed things along.

10
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:31,964
Mmm! Crunchy,
energizing goodness!

11
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:33,832
Finn: Hey, folks...

12
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:36,568
Hate to interrupt
snack time, but--

13
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,237
fetch!

14
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,405
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?

15
00:00:44,677 --> 00:00:47,079
I guess one should
never come between

16
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:49,481
a hungry ox
and its vittles.

17
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:51,683
Grrr.

18
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:54,286
Pterodactyl snatches ox!

19
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:55,387
Uh-oh.

20
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:56,555
Aah!

21
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,275
Bwaa!

22
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,682
To the plane,
quickly!

23
00:01:56,684 --> 00:01:58,617
Come on, boy!

24
00:02:01,654 --> 00:02:03,388
Hunh! Huhh!

25
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,737
Thunder fist!

26
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:20,539
Bwaa!

27
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:21,640
Huh?

28
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,848
Yah!

29
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,190
Go, go, go!

30
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:39,825
Uh, what he said.

31
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:42,594
(Panting)

32
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:43,996
Jade:
Jackie, come on!

33
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:00,512
Hak foo: Tiger lands
on eagle's back!

34
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:06,151
Bwaaa!

35
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:11,156
Tohru! Help Jackie!

36
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:13,759
(Gulps)
Out there?

37
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:21,333
(Gulps)

38
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:25,137
Tohru: Jackie!

39
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:28,373
Gah! Eee!

40
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:32,678
Bwaaaa!

41
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,779
Hyuh!

42
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:37,449
Hit it!

43
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,723
Aah!

44
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,660
(Gasps)

45
00:03:48,662 --> 00:03:50,462
Jade: Sit back
and relax, Jackie.

46
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:52,531
You've been upgraded
to an indoor seat.

47
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,272
Welcome to your new digs.

48
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,611
Hey, everyone!

49
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:09,314
Say hello to the mightiest
member of the zodiac gang.

50
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:11,149
Jade of the jungle.

51
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:13,218
Hiya, boy.

52
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,419
This is scruffy.

53
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,088
(Barking)

54
00:04:17,724 --> 00:04:19,992
Look, scruffy's
herding again.

55
00:04:19,994 --> 00:04:22,527
He's gotta be
part sheepdog.

56
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:24,663
Smart doggy.

57
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,800
(Purrs)

58
00:04:28,802 --> 00:04:30,335
And this is Sasha.

59
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:32,638
She used to be
a Vegas show girl.

60
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,906
Good Sasha,
pretty Sasha.

61
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:38,810
Ahem. You can
finish introductions
later, Jade.

62
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:40,746
It's almost
time for school.

63
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:42,447
(Gasps) School?

64
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,816
All good things
must come to an end,

65
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,785
even spring break.

66
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,453
No, I totally spaced!

67
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:51,757
I am so in trouble.

68
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,358
Teacher: It seems
every other student

69
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,893
managed
to prepare an exhibit

70
00:04:54,895 --> 00:04:56,628
for tomorrow's
school fair.

71
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:59,798
What is your excuse
this time, Jade?

72
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,467
Um, would you believe
I had to help rescue

73
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:05,070
a super-strong ox
from the dark warriors?

74
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:08,040
What, no
invisible rabbit?

75
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:10,008
Put a sock in it, drew.

76
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,144
And it's
a super-speed rabbit.

77
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,348
Jade, luckily
you still have one day

78
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,716
to put
an exhibit together,

79
00:05:17,718 --> 00:05:19,985
which shouldn't be
too much of a problem

80
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,154
considering
your imagination.

81
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,793
You could always bring
your magic animals.

82
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:30,629
(Students laughing)

83
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:33,265
Yes, I could,
couldn't I?

84
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:38,003
My enemies possess
9 talisman powers

85
00:05:38,005 --> 00:05:40,605
and I only possess 2?

86
00:05:40,607 --> 00:05:43,842
I have you
to thank for that.

87
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,911
Hak foo.

88
00:05:45,913 --> 00:05:46,978
Sheesh.

89
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,780
Get with the program,
will you?

90
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:50,916
Grrr.

91
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:52,451
I meant all of you!

92
00:05:52,453 --> 00:05:54,052
Pah!

93
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:56,254
I must locate
the remaining animal

94
00:05:56,256 --> 00:06:01,626
and find a way
to tip the balance
of power in my favor.

95
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:07,699
(Hoofbeats)

96
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:08,800
Hmm?

97
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:10,302
(Hoofbeats stop)

98
00:06:22,014 --> 00:06:24,082
Good invisible snake.

99
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:36,895
Rabbit power!

100
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:50,776
Easy does it, fellas.

101
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:52,778
Bwaa!

102
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,012
Jade!

103
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:56,782
Oh, can you believe
these strays wandered in?

104
00:06:56,784 --> 00:06:59,317
Section 13 is so
turning into a barn.

105
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,520
Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!

106
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:02,921
Oh, Jade,

107
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:04,990
have you come up
with anything
for the fair yet?

108
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:06,925
I cannot wait
to come see.

109
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,794
The f-fair?

110
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:12,731
Uh, you really
don't want to come.

111
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:14,399
I don't?
No!

112
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:16,868
Um,
I decided to make
an exhibit of...

113
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,070
Uh, mashed potato
sculptures.

114
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:21,206
Snoresville.
Heh heh.

115
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:24,376
Well, uh, gotta
cook up some spuds.

116
00:07:24,378 --> 00:07:25,477
Later!

117
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:27,412
Potato
sculptures?

118
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:30,882
Young Jade has
a very unique mind.

119
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,820
Whew! Ok, haiku,

120
00:07:34,822 --> 00:07:36,154
change 'em back!

121
00:07:39,892 --> 00:07:40,959
Head count!

122
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:43,862
1, 2, 3, 4,
1, 2, 3, 4--9.

123
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:45,697
We're off to the fair.

124
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:52,571
(Children chattering)

125
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:59,711
Now remember:

126
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:03,148
Ix-nay on the agic-may, ok?

127
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:07,886
If anything goes wrong,
uncle Jackie will
ground me for life.

128
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:10,188
No way!

129
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,325
A petting zoo?

130
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:15,961
Look. don't touch.

131
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,932
Where did you
get all of these?

132
00:08:20,934 --> 00:08:24,336
These, drew, just happen
to be the animals I,

133
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:28,373
um, borrowed from
my cousin, the zookeeper.

134
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:33,678
Hey, these are the magic
animals, aren't they?

135
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,115
No. I mean, heh heh.
You got me, drew.

136
00:08:37,117 --> 00:08:40,752
I was making all
that magic stuff up
the whole time.

137
00:08:40,754 --> 00:08:42,587
Heh. Heh heh heh. Uh.

138
00:08:42,589 --> 00:08:44,956
Me and
my imagination.

139
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,893
Ahh, yes.

140
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:49,895
Reveal yourself to me.

141
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:50,962
Uhh?

142
00:08:50,964 --> 00:08:52,831
The dog?

143
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,599
There must be some mistake.

144
00:08:57,837 --> 00:09:00,071
They are vulnerable again?

145
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:11,216
Jade will be
very surprised
to see us.

146
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:18,023
Ooh, games.

147
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:20,125
Who wants to play
whack-a-mole?

148
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,894
We are here
to whack real animals!

149
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,462
And this time,

150
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:27,332
we will not fail.

151
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:36,875
Come on, Jade.

152
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:40,278
I've never seen
a magic animal trick.

153
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,113
Uh, shouldn't you
be annoying people

154
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:43,882
at your
own booth, drew?

155
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:45,016
(Gasps)

156
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,754
(No audio)

157
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:54,960
(Woof woof)

158
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:56,928
Drew, buddy!

159
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,396
Hold the fort
for me.

160
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:03,568
And whatever you do,
don't touch anything.

161
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,339
Sure thing, Jade.

162
00:10:07,341 --> 00:10:10,275
Step right up!
Ring the bell!

163
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:11,943
Pick a prize!

164
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:20,118
I will win
something for Jade.

165
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,787
Pfft. Games
are rigged.

166
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:30,929
Uhh!

167
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:31,997
(Clang)

168
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,436
Supermoose.

169
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,240
Jade's favorite.

170
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:44,809
Hey! What are you guys
doing here?

171
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,345
Tohru: Surprising you.

172
00:10:47,347 --> 00:10:50,749
We can't wait to see
your potato sculptures.

173
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:54,185
Potato? Oh!
I mean...Uh...

174
00:10:54,187 --> 00:10:56,254
Duh...Too bad
you missed 'em!

175
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:58,757
They were delicious.

176
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:01,593
Ashley's booth
features her
key chain collection.

177
00:11:01,595 --> 00:11:02,661
Oof!

178
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,834
(Gasps)
Dark warriors!

179
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,636
What are you
doing here?

180
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:19,010
Come on, bunny.

181
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:20,645
Show me your tricks.

182
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:24,315
(Falling bell
- whistles through the air)

183
00:11:37,463 --> 00:11:39,531
(People screaming)

184
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,404
Yaaah!

185
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:53,244
Whoa! I wonder what else

186
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:55,780
Jade's been saying
that's true.

187
00:11:55,782 --> 00:11:57,515
Grrr.

188
00:11:57,517 --> 00:12:00,518
So you have come
for the animals?

189
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,754
Uh, what animals?

190
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:04,556
Uh, yeah. Heh.

191
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:07,025
I don't see any
animals around here.

192
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:22,273
No! Come back!

193
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:23,341
Scruffy!

194
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:37,956
Rahr! Oof!

195
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,291
Rrrr.

196
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:44,763
Ohh! Dark warrior!

197
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:47,565
Daolon: Enough dallying.
The animals!

198
00:12:51,837 --> 00:12:53,838
Evil on the loose?

199
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:57,909
Here comes supermoose!

200
00:12:57,911 --> 00:12:59,110
Heh heh.

201
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:02,313
I bet you're wondering
why all the animals--

202
00:13:02,315 --> 00:13:03,548
I know why.

203
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:18,897
Which way
did they go?

204
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:21,199
Ohh! Every way!

205
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:23,401
We must split up.

206
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:27,505
Remain here.

207
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:29,574
But, Jackie,
there are 9 animals,

208
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:31,609
4 evil dudes,
and only 3 of you!

209
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:32,744
We need to even things--

210
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:36,314
Jade, you have
caused enough trouble.

211
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,119
(Sighs)

212
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:43,388
You're right. I have.

213
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:47,592
Which is why I need
to make things right.

214
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:53,264
Tourists: Aah!
Help!

215
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:54,365
Let's get outta here!

216
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:55,733
A tiger!

217
00:13:55,735 --> 00:14:00,171
(Kissing) Pussy cat,
want some fishy-fish?

218
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,577
Hand me the tiger.

219
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:08,413
Funny, I was gonna
say the same thing.

220
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,859
Come to papa.

221
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:21,993
Huh?

222
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,454
No, no, no!

223
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:52,423
Do not eat the astroturf!

224
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,794
Whaddya know, chan?

225
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:59,230
You're on a roll!

226
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:03,401
Aah!

227
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,469
Aah!

228
00:15:21,654 --> 00:15:24,422
Chow: We're on astral-turf!

229
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:37,502
No.

230
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:39,337
I was not expecting
to feel that.

231
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:41,873
Guess it's 'cause
we're both astral.

232
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,482
There you are,
little fella.

233
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,918
Come on. Let's
get you some cheese.

234
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:00,525
Eeyah!

235
00:16:02,261 --> 00:16:03,628
Whoa!

236
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,731
Uh-oh.

237
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:14,105
I will take the rat.

238
00:16:14,107 --> 00:16:15,974
(Supermoose
tootles fanfare)

239
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,408
Antler action!

240
00:16:18,577 --> 00:16:21,813
You will take the moose
on the jaw!

241
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:25,249
Grrr.

242
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,995
You the man, supermoose.

243
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,634
Supernova
incinerates super--

244
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:53,211
evil on the loose,
you do not want
to mess with supermoose!

245
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:58,182
Uncle: So, do you
want a piece of uncle?

246
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:02,086
(Chanting)

247
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,057
Aah!

248
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:12,697
Nobody messes
with the "do."

249
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:56,874
Ha ha! Time to jet!

250
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:06,184
He is one
slippery character.

251
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:08,886
Please, come
to uncle Jackie.

252
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,626
Baa!

253
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,728
Baa!

254
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:31,242
Good sheep.

255
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:43,254
Huh?

256
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,402
Uncle and tohru are busy
devising a locator spell

257
00:18:58,404 --> 00:19:00,605
to find
the remaining animals.

258
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:03,541
Let us hope
- that it is not too late.

259
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,377
(Sighs)

260
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:11,115
Jackie, I deserve
to be grounded for life,

261
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:14,485
but I'm hoping you'll
settle for a month or 2.

262
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,195
Scruffy!

263
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:26,297
Scruffy!

264
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:27,999
Just like
I trained you.

265
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:29,467
But how?

266
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:31,502
Told you scruffy
was part sheepdog,

267
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,304
and I taught him
the way home.

268
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:36,774
Good boy.
Good boy, scruffy.

269
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,516
Jade, would you mind
explaining exactly

270
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,119
what happened
at your booth yesterday?

271
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:50,721
Uh, would you believe--

272
00:19:50,723 --> 00:19:54,125
the dark warriors,
like, appeared
from out of thin air,

273
00:19:54,127 --> 00:19:57,128
and--and then the--the
magic animals ran off

274
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,830
and turned
invisible and stuff!

275
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:04,602
Oh, drew. I think
you may be spending
too much time with Jade.

276
00:20:05,737 --> 00:20:07,805
(Supermoose
tootles fanfare)

277
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:13,211
A flying moose!

278
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:23,721
Gee, Ms. hardman,
and I thought <i> I</i>
had quite the imagination.

279
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:30,828
- Hey, Jackie!
- Yes.

280
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,197
Have you ever worked
with any dangerous animals?

281
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:36,100
Oh, yes. I remember
when I make the movies,

282
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:38,836
it's a leopard.
Every time--grrr--

283
00:20:38,838 --> 00:20:41,205
he try to attack me.
That is scary.

284
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:44,809
Then I remember
the animal really
can recognize the people.

285
00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:47,245
Not everybody.
Except me. Only me.

286
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:50,314
I don't know why
every time the leopard
see me, he say attack me.
