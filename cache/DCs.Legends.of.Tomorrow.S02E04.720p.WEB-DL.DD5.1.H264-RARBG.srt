vulnerable to attack,</i>

3
00:00:04,990 --> 00:00:06,923
<i>which is why we must
travel through time</i>

4
00:00:06,925 --> 00:00:10,093
<i>to stop the spread of these
so-called Time Aberrations</i>

10
00:00:22,007 --> 00:00:23,239
I think I can save him.

00:00:23,241 --> 00:00:24,574
<i>It's a biomolecular enhancer.</i>

<b>Name's Steel.

00:00:28,058 --> 00:00:31,247
I'm not going back until Rex's
killer is brought to justice.

15
00:00:31,249 --> 00:00:34,083
You let the shogun steal
a 21st century super-suit?

16
00:00:34,085 --> 00:00:35,618
I have to teach you to destroy

00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,087
the only thing that makes me hero.

18
00:00:38,089 --> 00:00:40,156
- Do it!
- Aah!

19
00:00:44,696 --> 00:00:48,431
- I am so sorry.
- It's okay.

20
00:01:01,246 --> 00:01:05,815
Dontar.

21
00:01:05,817 --> 00:01:07,817
Dontar, are you reading this?

22
00:01:09,354 --> 00:01:11,921
They're dead! They're all dead.

23
00:01:11,923 --> 00:01:13,456
The heist went off easy.

24
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:15,959
We got the TX-90 out of 2235

25
00:01:15,961 --> 00:01:17,994
as contracted, but...

26
00:01:17,996 --> 00:01:19,796
but Alec got infected.

27
00:01:19,798 --> 00:01:21,831
And then he killed...

28
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:24,968
God, you wouldn't imagine
what he did to everyone.

29
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,203
I don't know when I am.

30
00:01:40,205 --> 00:01:42,739
I'm activating the temporal beacon.

31
00:01:42,741 --> 00:01:44,041
You get in the "Dauntless"

32
00:01:44,043 --> 00:01:47,144
and you get out here and rescue my ass.

33
00:01:55,821 --> 00:01:57,354
Don't move.

34
00:01:57,356 --> 00:02:00,057

So, forever is basically

61
00:03:07,074 --> 00:03:10,309
A bit vulgar for a Time Master.

62
00:03:10,311 --> 00:03:12,778
Time Pirate, we're thinking.

63
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,080
He activated a beacon.
We have to go after him.

64
00:03:15,082 --> 00:03:16,782
He's a Time Pirate.
Why would we rescue him?

65
00:03:16,784 --> 00:03:18,684
Because if he ends up
somewhere he shouldn't...

66
00:03:18,686 --> 00:03:20,152
And does something he shouldn't...

67
00:03:20,154 --> 00:03:22,855
It's Aberration-palooza.

68
00:03:22,857 --> 00:03:27,126
So, where do we think
he's going to end up?

69
00:03:29,196 --> 00:03:32,731
Looks like Mississippi, 1863.

70
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:34,867
Height of the American Civil War.

71
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:37,269
It's also the bloodiest
year in American history.

72
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:39,572
We gotta watch each
other's backs out there.

73
00:03:39,574 --> 00:03:43,742
Yes, which is why you will be
watching ours from right here.

74
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,411

76
00:03:47,148 --> 00:03:49,915
someone has to stay behind as backup.

<i>I can't believe Ray got pined.</i>

78
00:03:51,986 --> 00:03:54,219
No suit, no powers, no tech.

79
00:03:54,221 --> 00:03:57,349
I mean, I guess Sara had no
choice but to bench him.

80
00:03:57,374 --> 00:04:00,693
Well, I-I'm sure she's
just trying to keep him safe.

81
00:04:00,695 --> 00:04:04,964
This time period is replete
with various perils.

82
00:04:04,966 --> 00:04:07,533
Perhaps it might be easier

83
00:04:07,535 --> 00:04:12,905
if you were to remain behind
and keep Dr. Palmer company.

84
00:04:12,907 --> 00:04:16,508
Perhaps you should remain behind.

85
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:19,311
No? Because you're not black.

86
00:04:19,313 --> 00:04:22,047
Because you think that,
me going back to 1863,

87
00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:23,549
- I can't handle it.
- That doesn't mean

88
00:04:23,551 --> 00:04:25,918
there's a need for you
to subject yourself

89
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,055
to the horrors that
await you in that era.

90
00:04:30,057 --> 00:04:33,859
Okay, now, I get it might be difficult

91
00:04:33,861 --> 00:04:36,061
for you to understand this,

92
00:04:36,063 --> 00:04:38,964
but I've been black my entire life, Grey.

93
00:04:38,966 --> 00:04:41,600
And honestly, I can't think of a
time period we could go to

94
00:04:41,602 --> 00:04:44,603
where I wouldn't face
some sort of racism.

95
00:04:44,605 --> 00:04:46,405
So don't worry. Okay?

96
00:04:56,317 --> 00:04:59,151
Along with comms devices,
I also packed sacked lunches.

97
00:04:59,153 --> 00:05:02,388
I figured the food in
1863 is pretty lousy.

98
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:04,156
All right, the operation is simple.

99
00:05:04,158 --> 00:05:06,925
We isolate the target,
we eliminate the timeship,

100
00:05:06,927 --> 00:05:08,327
and we get out of there.

101
00:05:08,329 --> 00:05:10,929
And all while wearing this dress.

102
00:05:10,931 --> 00:05:12,564
Come back safe.

103
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,739
<i>It's Mississippi, 1863.</i>

104

00:05:41,028 --> 00:05:42,861
It looks to be some kind of escape pod.

112
00:05:42,863 --> 00:05:44,963
No doubt, it fell out
of the Temporal Zone.

113

No sign of anyone.

114

00:07:39,313 --> 00:07:41,079
Don't... don't... don't say it!

164
00:07:44,385 --> 00:07:46,919
Quick, quick, just merge!

165
00:08:08,809 --> 00:08:10,776
Aah!

166
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,489
Ahh!</b>

167
00:08:27,595 --> 00:08:29,294
Is everybody okay?

168
00:08:31,732 --> 00:08:33,098
What the hell was that?

169
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,933
You ask me, they look like zo...

170
00:08:34,935 --> 00:08:36,535
No! Please, don't say it.

171
00:08:36,537 --> 00:08:37,936
I know they're essentially a myth,

172
00:08:37,938 --> 00:08:39,638
but I have this irrational fear of...

173
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,206
- Zombies.
- Please, don't say it.

174
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,342
<b>Oh, God.

175
00:08:43,344 --> 00:08:44,843
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

176
00:08:44,845 --> 00:08:46,411
Hey.</b>

177
00:08:46,413 --> 00:08:49,114
- Hang on.
- Satch...

178
00:08:49,116 --> 00:08:51,583
- What?
- My... satchel.

179
00:08:54,688 --> 00:08:57,723
Are you... Union?

180
00:08:57,725 --> 00:09:01,393
- Kinda.
- My... my orders.

181
00:09:01,395 --> 00:09:03,128
Collins Plantations.

182
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:06,431
Confederate troop movements.

183
00:09:07,601 --> 00:09:11,203
Without them...

184
00:09:11,205 --> 00:09:13,438
Hey. Hey!

185
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,078
Nice job blowing up the
Time Pirate's escape pod.

186
00:09:28,103 --> 00:09:29,726
Put another win in the mission column.

187
00:09:29,728 --> 00:09:31,695
Did you not see what happened next?

188
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:34,498
No, I took a break.
Had to go to the bathroom.

189
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,799
<b>You okay?

190
00:09:35,801 --> 00:09:37,934
We were attacked by zombies.

191
00:09:37,936 --> 00:09:41,605
And someone put sprouts on my sandwich.

192
00:09:41,607 --> 00:09:42,991
The Time Pirate's distress call

193
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:44,875
referenced something called a TX-90.

194
00:09:44,877 --> 00:09:46,409
It's a futurist bioweapon.

195
00:09:46,411 --> 00:09:49,579
The infected's condition
represents strongly

196
00:09:49,581 --> 00:09:53,250
those things... that... I can't say.

197
00:09:53,252 --> 00:09:55,285
And if that infected
Time Pirate is out there

198
00:09:55,287 --> 00:09:58,221
spreading this virus,
then our work is not done here.

199
00:09:58,223 --> 00:09:59,790
No kidding. Having zombies,

200
00:09:59,792 --> 00:10:01,324
or whatever they are,

201
00:10:01,326 --> 00:10:03,727
running around the Civil
War is not a good thing.

202
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,696
Speaking of not good.

203
00:10:06,698 --> 00:10:08,198
Get him to the MedBay.

204
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,503
What's going on?

205
00:10:13,505 --> 00:10:15,305
Apparently, uh, you were wounded

206
00:10:15,307 --> 00:10:17,908
during our encounter with the infected.

207
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,609
Impossible.

208
00:10:19,611 --> 00:10:23,480
Those creepy bastards
didn't lay a finger on me.

209
00:10:23,482 --> 00:10:25,448
But they might have gotten in a tooth.

210
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:26,750
Or 30.

211
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:28,552
<b>Oh, my God.

212
00:10:28,554 --> 00:10:30,187
He's already starting to turn.

213
00:10:30,189 --> 00:10:32,622
Ray, you gotta fix me.

214
00:10:32,624 --> 00:10:35,725
I don't want to be turned
into a frickin' zombie.

215
00:10:38,664 --> 00:10:40,030
Oh, my God.

216
00:10:40,032 --> 00:10:42,132
Yeah, it's pretty disastrous.

217
00:10:42,134 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm guessing, thanks to the zombies,

218
00:10:44,002 --> 00:10:46,903
the Confederacy won its
independence from the Union.

219
00:10:46,905 --> 00:10:48,572
It wasn't just them.

220
00:10:48,574 --> 00:10:52,776
That guy, the dispatch,
these are his mission orders.

221
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:56,346
From General Ulysses S. Grant.

222
00:10:56,348 --> 00:10:57,981
My God.

223
00:10:57,983 --> 00:11:00,016
He was supposed to infiltrate
the Collins Plantation

224
00:11:00,018 --> 00:11:02,552
and steal Confederate
troop movement orders.

225
00:11:02,554 --> 00:11:04,387
They named a high school after him?

226
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:06,556
That's because in the
original version of history,

227
00:11:06,558 --> 00:11:08,825
the plans Scott stole helped Grant

228
00:11:08,827 --> 00:11:11,695
win the Battle of Champion Hill.

229
00:11:11,697 --> 00:11:13,230
And I'm guessing none of that happened

230
00:11:13,232 --> 00:11:15,498
because Scott was
bayonetted by a Confederate

231
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,168
turned into a zombie by a future virus.

232
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,537
Okay, so...

233
00:11:20,539 --> 00:11:21,504
how do we fix it?

234
00:11:21,506 --> 00:11:23,406
<i>We</i> don't.

235
00:11:23,408 --> 00:11:24,708
I do.

236
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:26,142
- Jax.
- There's a reason

237
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,545
black people were used as spies.

238
00:11:28,547 --> 00:11:30,981
Because we were invisible.

239
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:32,883
That's why I'm going in there.

240
00:11:32,885 --> 00:11:34,951
Don't worry.
If anything happens, it's on me.

241
00:11:34,953 --> 00:11:37,120
No, Jax, it's on me.

242
00:11:37,122 --> 00:11:39,122
Look, Mick is already hurt,
and I don't like the idea

243
00:11:39,124 --> 00:11:40,757
of putting anyone else in harm's way.

244
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:42,792
And I don't like the
idea of having a flag

245
00:11:42,794 --> 00:11:44,828
that has 20 stars on it.

246
00:11:46,899 --> 00:11:48,932
I'm definitely
not letting you

247
00:11:48,934 --> 00:11:50,400
go in there alone.

248
00:11:50,402 --> 00:11:52,269
Fine, I'll take Amaya.

249
00:11:52,271 --> 00:11:54,537
All right. Nate and I will go

250
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:56,973
warn the Union Army about
the infected soldiers.

251
00:11:56,975 --> 00:11:58,808
Okay.

252
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:01,044
When we get to wherever we're going,

253
00:12:01,046 --> 00:12:02,512
maybe I should be the one

254
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:05,248
that breaks the zombie
news to General Grant.

255
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,284
I'm someone he'll listen to.

256
00:12:07,286 --> 00:12:09,085
Because you're a man?

257
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:12,422
We're a couple hundred years
away from gender equality.

258
00:12:12,424 --> 00:12:14,524
- Only a couple hundred?
- Look, all I'm saying is,

259
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:16,793
maybe... just maybe...
When we get to the Union Army,

260
00:12:16,795 --> 00:12:18,028
you let me do the talking.

261
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,429
<b>Wait where you are.

262
00:12:19,431 --> 00:12:20,497
Right there.

263
00:12:20,499 --> 00:12:23,967
Okay. You do the talking.

264
00:12:25,737 --> 00:12:28,271
So, what's our plan?

265
00:12:28,273 --> 00:12:29,940
Well, if things go easy,

266
00:12:29,942 --> 00:12:32,075
we sneak in while everybody's asleep,

267
00:12:32,077 --> 00:12:34,611
find the Confederate
plans, and grab them.

268
00:12:34,613 --> 00:12:37,547
Are things ever
easy with your group?

269
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:39,549
- Eh, good point.
- Please, don't!

270
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,085
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to burn the table cloth!

271
00:12:42,087 --> 00:12:44,254
It was an accident, I swear!

272
00:12:44,256 --> 00:12:45,956
An accident? You just let yourself

273
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,557
get distracted, that's all.

274
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,726
While you should have been
thinking about the ironing,

275
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,895
you were probably daydreaming
about Ulysses S. Grant

276
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:53,930
marching down here
to free all the slaves.

277
00:12:53,932 --> 00:12:56,199
No, sir. I wasn't.

278
00:12:56,201 --> 00:12:58,134
- Oh.
- Which is why

279
00:12:58,136 --> 00:12:59,970
I need to focus your attention.

280
00:12:59,972 --> 00:13:02,138
- No, no, no, wait.
- He's going to hurt her.

281
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:04,007
I know, and it's awful.

282
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:05,608
But if we blow our cover now,

283
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,510
we won't be able to fix the Aberration.

284
00:13:07,512 --> 00:13:09,179
And we might lose the Civil War.

285
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:15,218
Don't matter how much you cry.

286
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,220
I'm still gonna hurt you.</b>

287
00:13:24,391 --> 00:13:25,690
Raymond, please hurry.

288
00:13:25,715 --> 00:13:27,249
I don't like the way this is going.

289
00:13:27,251 --> 00:13:29,684
You don't like the way this is going?

290
00:13:29,686 --> 00:13:32,721
How close are you to
formulating a workable vaccine?

291
00:13:32,723 --> 00:13:33,722
Very.

292
00:13:33,724 --> 00:13:36,524
I think.

293
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:41,329
Raymond.

294
00:13:41,331 --> 00:13:43,698
I'm counting on you.

295
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,134
Don't worry, Mick. I got you.

296
00:13:48,705 --> 00:13:50,438
Here we go.

297
00:13:54,645 --> 00:13:56,111
What's happening?

298
00:13:56,113 --> 00:13:57,445
His heart rate's spiking.

299
00:13:57,447 --> 00:14:00,548
Gideon, administer the sedative now!

300
00:14:05,155 --> 00:14:07,155
Zombie! Zombie! Zombie!

301
00:14:07,157 --> 00:14:10,058
- Screaming isn't helping.
- Zombie!

302
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,860
Gideon, put the ship on lockdown!

303
00:14:11,862 --> 00:14:14,696
<i>Lockdown mode activated.</i>

304
00:14:21,471 --> 00:14:23,038
This is incredible.

305
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,407
I did my sophomore
thesis on the Civil War.

306
00:14:25,409 --> 00:14:27,642
I smell a history lesson coming.

307
00:14:27,644 --> 00:14:30,078
Fun fact: Did you know,
out of the 3 million people

308
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,246
who fought on both sides,

309
00:14:31,248 --> 00:14:33,948
300 were women in drag?

310
00:14:35,252 --> 00:14:38,920
How is that not a fun fact for you?

311
00:14:38,922 --> 00:14:42,057
General, we caught these two
outside the northeast perimeter.

312
00:14:42,059 --> 00:14:44,326
This here is a war
zone, so either you two

313
00:14:44,328 --> 00:14:48,330
are Confederate spies, or you...

314
00:14:48,332 --> 00:14:49,964
are very lost.

315
00:14:49,966 --> 00:14:52,734
Actually, we're neither, General Grant.

316
00:14:52,736 --> 00:14:54,502
- How do you know my name?
- I'm a fan.

317
00:14:54,504 --> 00:14:56,604
Actually, I'm, like, a really big fan.

318
00:14:56,606 --> 00:14:59,507
And you are surprisingly taller
than I thought in real life.

319
00:14:59,509 --> 00:15:01,276
Um...

320
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:04,956
I'm a Colonel in the Union Army.

321
00:15:04,981 --> 00:15:06,181
Colonel Sanders.

322
00:15:06,183 --> 00:15:07,415
I'm Colonel Sanders

323
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:09,584
with the 31st Pennsylvania Infantry.

324
00:15:09,586 --> 00:15:12,554
Then why are you not
in proper uniform, son?

325
00:15:12,556 --> 00:15:14,756
My uniform's in the wash, sir.

326
00:15:14,758 --> 00:15:18,026
Or you are a Confederate spy.</b>

327
00:15:18,028 --> 00:15:21,129
- Okay.
- Look, we're not Confederates.

328
00:15:21,131 --> 00:15:22,464
And truth be told, we're not a part

329
00:15:22,466 --> 00:15:23,832
of the Union either.

330
00:15:23,834 --> 00:15:25,033
But we are here to tell you

331
00:15:25,035 --> 00:15:26,781
that your company is in danger.

332
00:15:26,806 --> 00:15:29,540
In danger?

333
00:15:29,542 --> 00:15:30,741
Of what?

334
00:15:30,743 --> 00:15:32,443
Well, believe it or not,

335
00:15:32,445 --> 00:15:35,480
a horde of zombies is headed your way.

336
00:15:35,482 --> 00:15:37,348
What is a zombie?

337
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:40,051
They're not familiar with
that word for another 70 years.

338
00:15:40,053 --> 00:15:42,220
- I've had enough nonsense.
- Look, it's not nonsense.

339
00:15:42,222 --> 00:15:46,023
It's just really hard to explain.

340
00:15:46,025 --> 00:15:50,394
And it would be a lot
easier if I just showed you.

341
00:15:50,396 --> 00:15:52,697
And if I'm not back for any reason,

342
00:15:52,699 --> 00:15:55,533
feel free to shoot him.

343
00:15:56,703 --> 00:15:59,737
Just don't listen to her.

344
00:16:05,311 --> 00:16:07,478
They're having some kind of party.

345
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:10,114
Oh, a Cotillion, actually.

346
00:16:10,116 --> 00:16:12,016
According to Scott's mission papers,

347
00:16:12,018 --> 00:16:16,487
he was going to get in
disguised as the help.

348
00:16:16,489 --> 00:16:19,290
You mean slave?

349
00:16:22,295 --> 00:16:25,096
We could have helped her. We should have.

350
00:16:25,098 --> 00:16:27,565
Look, I've been doing
this time travel thing

351
00:16:27,567 --> 00:16:29,433
for a little while now.

352
00:16:29,435 --> 00:16:31,669
And if I've learned one thing,
it's you never know

353
00:16:31,671 --> 00:16:36,174
what's gonna change history
and have massive consequences.

354
00:16:36,176 --> 00:16:40,311
What, you think this doesn't
make me angry as well?

355
00:16:40,313 --> 00:16:42,246
But we have a job to do.

356
00:16:42,248 --> 00:16:46,117
And if we don't do it,
we can make things a lot worse.

357
00:16:48,922 --> 00:16:51,222
Just... just stay on comms, okay?

358
00:16:55,895 --> 00:16:57,762
He was... he was... he... he...

359
00:16:57,764 --> 00:17:00,097
Calm down, calm down.

360
00:17:00,099 --> 00:17:01,699
We're going to die.

361
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:04,435
- You just need to calm down.
- I will not calm down.

362
00:17:04,437 --> 00:17:06,137
He was threatening enough
before he was one of

363
00:17:06,139 --> 00:17:07,772
the walking dead!

364
00:17:07,774 --> 00:17:09,006
Why didn't your vaccine work?

365
00:17:09,008 --> 00:17:10,474
I-I-I don't know.

366
00:17:10,476 --> 00:17:12,243
It could be that subcutaneous delivery

367
00:17:12,245 --> 00:17:13,477
- needs more than one dose.
- Oh, and that didn't occur

368
00:17:13,479 --> 00:17:15,027
to you while formulating your serum?

369
00:17:15,052 --> 00:17:17,014
At least I'm not the one with
an irrational fear of zombies.

370
00:17:17,016 --> 00:17:19,317
There's nothing irrational
about my fear of zombies.

371
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,685
He's a zombie!

372
00:17:20,687 --> 00:17:21,852
Look, I'm pretty sure that I stunned him.

373
00:17:21,854 --> 00:17:23,011
Oh, you're pretty sure?

374
00:17:23,036 --> 00:17:24,488
And if he's knocked
out cold in the MedBay,

375
00:17:24,490 --> 00:17:25,957
all we have to do is go back in there

376
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:27,458
- and inject him again.
- And if he's not,

377
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,193
I'm pretty sure he'll kill us!

378
00:17:29,195 --> 00:17:32,863
So, me and my irrational
fear are staying right here.

379
00:17:32,865 --> 00:17:34,365
Listen to me, Marty...

380
00:17:34,367 --> 00:17:36,234
- Can I call you Marty?
- No.

381
00:17:36,236 --> 00:17:38,202
You have to help me. If you don't,

382
00:17:38,204 --> 00:17:41,239
and I get bitten, then you'll
have two zombies to deal with.

383
00:17:43,209 --> 00:17:46,043
Oh, my God.

384
00:18:17,043 --> 00:18:19,010
Amaya, it's Jax.

385
00:18:19,012 --> 00:18:20,768
<i>The study's a bust,
I'm gonna check the rest</i>

386
00:18:20,793 --> 00:18:22,446
<i>of the plantation house.</i>

387
00:18:27,153 --> 00:18:29,086
Oh!

388
00:18:29,088 --> 00:18:31,455
I am so sorry, ma'am.

389
00:18:31,457 --> 00:18:34,592
Boy, what did you just do?

390
00:18:34,594 --> 00:18:35,960
I, uh, I'm sorry.

391
00:18:35,962 --> 00:18:37,728
You took that woman's hand

392
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:38,996
and addressed her directly.

393
00:18:38,998 --> 00:18:41,632
No, sir, I-I did not.

394
00:18:41,634 --> 00:18:43,501
You calling me a liar, boy?

395
00:18:45,071 --> 00:18:49,607
I'm not calling you anything, sir.

396
00:18:49,609 --> 00:18:51,575
Who the hell are you?

397
00:18:51,577 --> 00:18:55,346
I'm with the additional staff
for tonight's festivities.

398
00:18:55,348 --> 00:18:59,517
Oh, so you're ignorant
about the house rules?

399
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:02,620
See, my staff know better
than to talk back to me.

400
00:19:02,622 --> 00:19:06,791
I'm very sorry. Won't happen again, sir.

401
00:19:06,793 --> 00:19:09,226
Hey!

402
00:19:09,228 --> 00:19:11,429
Don't you turn your back on me, boy.

403
00:19:11,431 --> 00:19:14,699
There a problem, Mr. Collins?

404
00:19:14,701 --> 00:19:18,336
Just a house boy who
don't know his place.

405
00:19:18,338 --> 00:19:20,304
And needs to be taught some manners.

406
00:19:23,676 --> 00:19:25,543
These zombies, they're...

407
00:19:25,545 --> 00:19:27,545
They're going to kill all of you.

408
00:19:27,547 --> 00:19:29,914
And I keep asking,

409
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,783
what in perdition's flames is a zombie?

410
00:19:32,785 --> 00:19:35,986
This.

411
00:19:35,988 --> 00:19:38,989
I found him and 50 others just like him

412
00:19:38,991 --> 00:19:40,725
less than a mile outside of your camp.

413
00:19:40,727 --> 00:19:42,760
And, yeah, I said less than a mile.

414
00:19:42,762 --> 00:19:46,097
Which means we don't have a lot of time.

415
00:19:48,601 --> 00:19:51,802
Okay. You ready?

416
00:19:51,804 --> 00:19:52,837
Mm-mm.

417
00:19:52,839 --> 00:19:54,505
Just relax.

418
00:19:54,507 --> 00:19:56,741
He's unconscious, remember?

419
00:20:05,618 --> 00:20:07,952
- Raymond.
- Yeah?

420
00:20:07,954 --> 00:20:10,688
If he's unconscious,

421
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:12,356
wouldn't he be here?

422
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:23,601
This isn't working.
We need more sharpshooters.

423
00:20:23,603 --> 00:20:24,869
I can't spare the men.

424
00:20:24,871 --> 00:20:26,837
You see what is out there.

425
00:20:26,839 --> 00:20:29,507
We have to think about
the battle that lies ahead.

426
00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:32,309
If we don't take Vicksburg,
we won't control the Mississippi,

427
00:20:32,311 --> 00:20:35,446
and we need command of
the river to win the war.

428
00:20:36,949 --> 00:20:38,616
At this rate, I'm afraid we will be out

429
00:20:38,618 --> 00:20:41,285
of ammunition before dawn.

430
00:20:41,287 --> 00:20:42,887
We need some backup.

431
00:20:46,692 --> 00:20:48,359
Damn, it's dark.

432
00:20:48,361 --> 00:20:51,829
Even if Mr. Rory wasn't
in a zombified state,

433
00:20:51,831 --> 00:20:53,731
I doubt he possesses the intelligence

434
00:20:53,733 --> 00:20:55,436
to operate a light switch.

435
00:20:55,461 --> 00:20:56,867
Well, he probably just destroyed

436
00:20:56,869 --> 00:20:58,302
a conduit or something.

437
00:20:58,304 --> 00:21:00,604
Well, that's hardly comforting, Raymond.

438
00:21:00,606 --> 00:21:03,274
Aah!</b>

439
00:21:03,276 --> 00:21:04,442
Aah.

440
00:21:04,444 --> 00:21:06,844
<b>Aah!

441
00:21:06,846 --> 00:21:08,345
<b>All right, come on!

442
00:21:08,347 --> 00:21:09,914
He got me! He's got my foot.

443
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:11,582
Oh, my God. Run, run!

444
00:21:11,584 --> 00:21:13,150
- Come on.
- Ah!

445
00:21:15,688 --> 00:21:17,121
This is a nightmare.

446
00:21:17,123 --> 00:21:18,989
If Mr. Rory's intention
is to eat our brains,

447
00:21:18,991 --> 00:21:20,958
can you imagine the
feast we'll provide him,

448
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,993
given our combined intellects?

449
00:21:22,995 --> 00:21:25,029
Wait, wait! Ah, ah!

450
00:21:25,031 --> 00:21:26,964
- Comfortable now?
- Ah!

451
00:21:26,966 --> 00:21:29,166
<b>Ahh, ahh, ah.

452
00:21:33,306 --> 00:21:35,406
You've got a long night ahead of you.

453
00:21:39,879 --> 00:21:42,913
Ahh. Ah.

454
00:21:47,053 --> 00:21:48,853
Hey.

455
00:21:48,855 --> 00:21:51,722
Oh.

456
00:21:51,724 --> 00:21:53,023
Damn it.

457
00:22:04,871 --> 00:22:07,238
- Ah.
- What is it?

458
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,106
It's...

459
00:22:09,108 --> 00:22:11,408
it's... it's Jefferson.

460
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:12,910
- What's happening to him?
- I'm not sure

461
00:22:12,912 --> 00:22:15,813
but I-I've never felt him so...

462
00:22:15,815 --> 00:22:17,948
So frightened or angry before.

463
00:22:20,453 --> 00:22:23,287
I knew I should have gone with him.

464
00:22:23,289 --> 00:22:24,588
Well, Sara and Nate are still out there.

465
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,656
Maybe they can get to him.

466
00:22:25,658 --> 00:22:27,558
<b>Ray, Martin.

467
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,727
I've lost contact with Jax and Amaya.

468
00:22:29,729 --> 00:22:31,061
I really could use some help out here.

469
00:22:31,063 --> 00:22:34,331
I suppose there's your answer.

470
00:22:34,333 --> 00:22:36,800
Here's the thing, Sara:
we'd love to come help.

471
00:22:36,802 --> 00:22:38,335
<i>But my vaccine didn't work,</i>

472
00:22:38,337 --> 00:22:41,071
<i>and Mick got turned into
one of those things.</i>

473
00:22:41,073 --> 00:22:43,173
And he's confined us to the galley.

474
00:22:45,945 --> 00:22:47,611
Until we can cure him,

475
00:22:47,613 --> 00:22:49,079
<i>you guys are on your own.</i>

476
00:22:49,081 --> 00:22:51,348
Yeah, looks like we all are.

477
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,790
Yeah.

478
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,403
Who are you?

479
00:23:00,349 --> 00:23:02,059
My name's Jackson.

480
00:23:02,061 --> 00:23:04,695
Ah, ah.

481
00:23:04,697 --> 00:23:06,096
Jefferson Jackson.

482
00:23:06,098 --> 00:23:08,098
Those are some pretty famous slave owners

483
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,608
you're named for, Jefferson.

484
00:23:10,633 --> 00:23:13,724
- Uh...
- Look at his hands.

485
00:23:13,749 --> 00:23:16,287
Have you ever worked a day in your life?

486
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:20,457
Uh, it's a long story.

487
00:23:20,459 --> 00:23:22,158
What are you doing here?

488
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,662
Also a long story.

489
00:23:25,664 --> 00:23:27,831
Uh, actually... ah.

490
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:29,966
Oh.

491
00:23:29,968 --> 00:23:33,136
Maybe... maybe you could help me.

492
00:23:35,173 --> 00:23:38,675
I'm here for General Grant.

493
00:23:38,677 --> 00:23:39,976
The Union general?

494
00:23:39,978 --> 00:23:41,244
He sent me to steal details

495
00:23:41,246 --> 00:23:43,012
of Confederate troop movements.

496
00:23:43,014 --> 00:23:45,048
Even if you could get your hands on them,

497
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:48,418
there ain't no way off this
plantation, Mr. Jackson.

498
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:51,521
- There's always a way.
- No.

499
00:23:51,523 --> 00:23:53,823
Master Collins got guard dogs.

500
00:23:53,825 --> 00:23:55,091
Cuban bloodhounds.

501
00:23:55,093 --> 00:23:56,693
Yeah, we had some friends.

502
00:23:56,695 --> 00:23:59,429
They got caught less than a mile out.

503
00:23:59,431 --> 00:24:00,897
But they didn't kill them.

504
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:03,566
No, they didn't want to lose the labor.

505
00:24:03,568 --> 00:24:05,168
So they cut off their manhood.

506
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,237
And then hobbled them,
so they could never think of

507
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:09,005
trying to run again.

508
00:24:09,007 --> 00:24:12,742
How do you endure this?

509
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:13,743
How does it not...

510
00:24:13,745 --> 00:24:15,912
Drive us all mad?

511
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:18,715
Because that's what they want it to do.

512
00:24:18,717 --> 00:24:21,251
They think they can break us.

Jax, are you there?

520
00:24:53,818 --> 00:24:54,984
Damn.

521
00:25:15,774 --> 00:25:18,575
Well, well, well.

522
00:25:21,813 --> 00:25:24,113
Who invited you to the party?

523
00:25:24,115 --> 00:25:27,250
Actually, my invitation must
have gotten lost in the mail.

524
00:25:27,252 --> 00:25:31,788
Hm, you sure have a smart mouth on you.

525
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:35,892
Mm, pretty one, though.

526
00:25:35,894 --> 00:25:38,695
We'll have to teach you a lesson on how to

527
00:25:38,697 --> 00:25:40,430
talk to your betters.

528
00:25:43,535 --> 00:25:46,369
We told Mick that we would save him.

529
00:25:46,371 --> 00:25:48,638
Plus, I still have the vaccine.

530
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:51,374
We just have to figure out
a way to get it to work.

531
00:25:57,482 --> 00:26:00,383
The vaccine wasn't effective
when we injected Mick.

532
00:26:00,385 --> 00:26:02,852
But if we can aerosolize the serum,

533
00:26:02,854 --> 00:26:04,854
and deploy it using something like a...

534
00:26:04,856 --> 00:26:06,289
A fire extinguisher,

535
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:08,191
we could deliver the cure as a spray.

536
00:26:08,193 --> 00:26:10,760
W-we're not doing anything.

537
00:26:10,762 --> 00:26:12,095
But you, on the other hand...

538
00:26:12,097 --> 00:26:13,129
Look, Marty,

539
00:26:13,131 --> 00:26:14,764
I know that you're scared.

540
00:26:14,766 --> 00:26:18,201
I've been nothing but scared
since my suit was destroyed.

541
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:21,137
I've been terrified that I
have nothing to offer the team.

542
00:26:21,139 --> 00:26:22,805
But you have to get over your fears

543
00:26:22,807 --> 00:26:24,440
if we're gonna survive this.

544
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:30,446
We've only seen these
things downwind from here.

545
00:26:30,448 --> 00:26:32,582
We can pick them off in this valley

546
00:26:32,584 --> 00:26:34,317
until they're all gone.

547
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:36,419
I got my best men on
the ridge to the West.

548
00:26:36,421 --> 00:26:40,823
But reports are,
they are running out of ammunition.

549
00:26:42,527 --> 00:26:43,793
What?

550
00:26:43,795 --> 00:26:47,063
Helps me think.

551
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:50,400
Well, without ammo,
we can't take

552
00:26:50,402 --> 00:26:53,436
all these zombies out,
even with perfect shots.

553
00:26:57,676 --> 00:26:59,976
Can I talk to you for a minute?

554
00:26:59,978 --> 00:27:01,177
Yeah.

555
00:27:04,282 --> 00:27:06,349
Mr. Collins is gonna love

556
00:27:06,351 --> 00:27:09,018
spending the midnight
hour with you, girlie.

557
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,853
I'm looking forward to it.

558
00:27:10,855 --> 00:27:13,356
I hope he enjoys getting
punched in the face.

559
00:27:17,696 --> 00:27:19,729
And thank you ever so much for showing me

560
00:27:19,731 --> 00:27:23,299
where to find my friend.

561
00:27:23,301 --> 00:27:25,335
What the hell was that?

562
00:27:25,337 --> 00:27:27,904
Don't you know a
breakout when you see one?

563
00:27:27,906 --> 00:27:30,239
Okay.

564
00:27:30,241 --> 00:27:32,475
Good. Now let's free them.

565
00:27:34,646 --> 00:27:36,946
I thought you said if
we didn't do our job,

566
00:27:36,948 --> 00:27:39,682
we could end up doing more harm than good.

567
00:27:39,684 --> 00:27:42,385
Yeah, that's still a risk.

568
00:27:42,387 --> 00:27:44,420
So what's changed?

569
00:27:44,422 --> 00:27:47,657
The way these people are being treated...

570
00:27:47,659 --> 00:27:51,027
that's the real Aberration.

571
00:27:51,029 --> 00:27:52,428
I can see that now.

572
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:54,964
This is the history that
needs to be fixed.

573
00:27:59,471 --> 00:28:01,804
No, no, I'm obliged,
ma'am, but I told you

574
00:28:01,806 --> 00:28:04,040
- what happens if they catch us.
- Don't worry.

575
00:28:04,042 --> 00:28:05,575
We're gonna protect you.

576
00:28:05,577 --> 00:28:07,110
I know you're scared.

577
00:28:07,112 --> 00:28:09,979
I get it. Don't ask me how I know this,

578
00:28:09,981 --> 00:28:13,249
but it gets better.

579
00:28:13,251 --> 00:28:15,284
Not perfect. Nowhere near close.

580
00:28:15,286 --> 00:28:17,286
But...

581
00:28:17,288 --> 00:28:20,123
better than this.

582
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:23,126
But it starts right now

583
00:28:23,128 --> 00:28:26,562
with us not giving up.

584
00:28:26,564 --> 00:28:28,064
Zambesi.

585
00:28:28,066 --> 00:28:29,832
Your amulet.

586
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:32,702
You are a warrior of the Zambezi.

587
00:28:32,704 --> 00:28:34,036
You're familiar with it.

588
00:28:34,038 --> 00:28:36,672
That's where my mother was born.

589
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:38,541
We must follow her.

590
00:28:38,543 --> 00:28:40,877
I believe in her.

591
00:28:40,879 --> 00:28:42,445
I believe in them.

592
00:28:44,315 --> 00:28:46,783
Then I do, too.

593
00:28:58,096 --> 00:29:00,530
- What is it?
- We got company.

594
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,407
We've gotta get out of here.

595
00:29:08,409 --> 00:29:10,143
Not without the Confederate plans.

596
00:29:10,145 --> 00:29:12,044
- I think I know where they are.
- Okay, you,

597
00:29:12,046 --> 00:29:13,513
get everyone to safety.

598
00:29:13,515 --> 00:29:16,549
- Come on.
- Wait, Jax.

599
00:29:16,551 --> 00:29:18,551
Good luck.

600
00:29:18,553 --> 00:29:20,753
You ready?

601
00:29:25,059 --> 00:29:26,526
Come on!

602
00:29:29,564 --> 00:29:30,563
This way.

603
00:29:39,574 --> 00:29:40,673
Go.

604
00:29:44,045 --> 00:29:46,913
Mr. Jackson.

605
00:29:46,915 --> 00:29:48,314
What are you doing, man?

606
00:29:51,352 --> 00:29:54,987
For when things get
better, like you said.

607
00:29:54,989 --> 00:29:57,957
Okay, come on.

608
00:30:01,496 --> 00:30:03,663
What in Sam Hill are these things?

609
00:30:03,665 --> 00:30:05,665
They're infected with something.

610
00:30:05,667 --> 00:30:07,233
<b>We gotta work together,

611
00:30:07,235 --> 00:30:09,135
or we'll never make it out of here alive.

612
00:30:09,137 --> 00:30:10,336
What are you saying?

613
00:30:10,338 --> 00:30:12,038
I'm saying give us weapons.

614
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,073
Without us, you'll never
be able to fight them off.

615
00:30:14,075 --> 00:30:15,975
You think I'm dumb enough
to arm my own slaves?

616
00:30:21,149 --> 00:30:22,448
Come on!

617
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:24,884
Help!

618
00:30:24,886 --> 00:30:25,952
For God's sake, help me!

619
00:30:26,988 --> 00:30:28,688
Go!

620
00:30:34,495 --> 00:30:36,262
We are down to our last rounds

621
00:30:36,264 --> 00:30:38,764
with no hope of stopping
those abominations.

622
00:30:38,766 --> 00:30:40,900
Whatever you have up your
sleeve, I suggest you play

623
00:30:40,902 --> 00:30:42,101
that card now, Ms. Lance.

624
00:30:42,103 --> 00:30:44,270
We are working on it.

625
00:30:44,272 --> 00:30:46,339
- You good?
- Am I good?

626
00:30:46,341 --> 00:30:48,374
Well, considering my survival hinges on

627
00:30:48,376 --> 00:30:50,409
me accessing a superpower
I'm not familiar with,

628
00:30:50,411 --> 00:30:52,378
I'm a little uhh.

629
00:30:53,748 --> 00:30:56,515
Run fast, run hard, don't die.

630
00:30:56,517 --> 00:30:57,650
Okay.

631
00:30:58,953 --> 00:31:01,487
I can promise you two of those things.

632
00:31:07,528 --> 00:31:09,595
- I'm in the MedBay.
<i>- Be careful, Raymond.</i>

633
00:31:09,597 --> 00:31:11,163
<i>It won't take long for Mr. Rory</i>

634
00:31:11,165 --> 00:31:12,965
<i>to figure out where you are.</i>

635
00:31:12,967 --> 00:31:16,636
Tell me something I don't know.

636
00:31:28,683 --> 00:31:30,750
Party's over!

637
00:31:40,628 --> 00:31:43,496
Those things are right
outside the perimeter.

638
00:31:43,498 --> 00:31:45,798
Kill the lights and hold your fire.

639
00:31:57,312 --> 00:32:00,046
Hey, over here!

640
00:32:00,048 --> 00:32:02,214
Come and get it, you ugly freaks!

641
00:32:03,418 --> 00:32:06,786
Follow me, you big dummies!

642
00:32:06,788 --> 00:32:08,654
Come on! Follow the light!

643
00:32:15,396 --> 00:32:17,963
Raymond?

644
00:32:17,965 --> 00:32:21,901
Raymond, where are you?

645
00:32:21,903 --> 00:32:23,869
What happened?

646
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,581
Oh, no. Don't be dead, Raymond.

647
00:32:35,583 --> 00:32:38,617
On the other hand, if you are dead,

648
00:32:38,619 --> 00:32:40,619
please stay dead.

649
00:32:47,729 --> 00:32:48,861
Oh.

650
00:32:48,863 --> 00:32:51,163
Just unconscious, well done.

651
00:32:51,165 --> 00:32:56,202
Now, where's that fire extinguisher?

652
00:33:00,308 --> 00:33:02,341
Okay, Martin.

653
00:33:02,343 --> 00:33:04,944
Just do what they did...

654
00:33:04,946 --> 00:33:08,881
in those zombie movies...

655
00:33:08,883 --> 00:33:11,851
that you never had the courage to watch.

656
00:33:16,324 --> 00:33:17,323
Come on!

657
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,494
That gentleman is either the bravest man

658
00:33:21,496 --> 00:33:24,497
I have ever had in my ranks,

659
00:33:24,499 --> 00:33:27,566
or the dumbest.

660
00:33:58,266 --> 00:34:01,200
If... if you'd... If you'd just cooperate

661
00:34:01,202 --> 00:34:04,036
things will go much easier for us.

662
00:34:12,814 --> 00:34:15,214
You may be stronger, but I assure you,

663
00:34:15,216 --> 00:34:17,850
you will not eat me today.

664
00:34:23,124 --> 00:34:27,526
Professor, what's going on?

665
00:34:27,528 --> 00:34:30,463
Was I just trying to kiss you?

666
00:34:30,465 --> 00:34:34,934
Uh, I could only hope, Mr. Rory.

667
00:34:34,936 --> 00:34:36,602
I can only hope.

668
00:34:38,873 --> 00:34:41,907
- Everybody good?
- Yeah.

669
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:43,476
Jax, we've gotta go.

670
00:34:43,478 --> 00:34:46,312
This fire is gonna attract
a lot of unwanted attention.

671
00:34:46,314 --> 00:34:47,780
I know.

672
00:34:47,782 --> 00:34:50,416
I want to enjoy this for a moment.

673
00:35:01,996 --> 00:35:03,295
Okay.

674
00:35:13,641 --> 00:35:16,008
You see your man anywhere?

675
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,447
What the?</b>

676
00:35:21,449 --> 00:35:23,082
Wait, hold your fire.

677
00:35:31,325 --> 00:35:32,858
Nate?

678
00:35:37,565 --> 00:35:41,567
I am covered in zombie guts.

679
00:35:41,569 --> 00:35:45,004
But you're alive.

680
00:35:45,006 --> 00:35:46,295
I think I'm gonna be sick.

681
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:52,325
This is a godsend.

682
00:35:52,327 --> 00:35:54,594
We know how the rebels are
planning to take Champion Hill,

683
00:35:54,596 --> 00:35:56,629
and when they do,
we will be there to give them hell.

684
00:35:56,631 --> 00:35:58,665
Set our cannon battery
up on the western ridge.

685
00:35:58,667 --> 00:35:59,899
- Yes, sir.
- We will light them up

686
00:35:59,901 --> 00:36:01,334
like the Fourth of July

687
00:36:01,336 --> 00:36:04,170
when they roll over that hill.

688
00:36:04,172 --> 00:36:07,040
- What's your name, son?
- Oh, it's Ja...

689
00:36:07,042 --> 00:36:09,375
Henry Scott.

690
00:36:09,377 --> 00:36:12,278
Mr. Scott, thank you for
your incredible bravery

691
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,948
and your service to the United States.

692
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:19,952
You may have just won this war for us.

693
00:36:19,954 --> 00:36:21,988
Are these men and women
from the Collins Plantation?

694
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:23,623
Yes, they are, sir.

695
00:36:23,625 --> 00:36:25,491
We will care for anyone seeking refuge

696
00:36:25,493 --> 00:36:27,660
in our camp from the Confederate states.

697
00:36:27,662 --> 00:36:31,331
We have plenty of food
and water for everyone.

698
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:33,333
Thank you.

699
00:36:38,273 --> 00:36:40,540
We've spread the vaccine
our friends worked up.

700
00:36:40,542 --> 00:36:42,608
The only Confederates you'll
have to worry about now

701
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:44,610
are the living ones.

702
00:36:44,612 --> 00:36:47,113
I'm obliged.

703
00:36:47,115 --> 00:36:50,516
Ah, your man Colonel Sanders, he, uh...

704
00:36:50,518 --> 00:36:52,852
tells me you're his captain.

705
00:36:52,854 --> 00:36:54,554
In any case, he mentioned something about

706
00:36:54,556 --> 00:37:00,526
you having regrets about
putting men in harm's way.

707
00:37:00,528 --> 00:37:04,597
I don't think that's something
I can ever get used to.

708
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:08,167
You know, by the time I
had taken over this division,

709
00:37:08,169 --> 00:37:11,204
there had already been three other generals

710
00:37:11,206 --> 00:37:12,638
in place before me.

711
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:15,541
They'd all stepped down and given up.

712
00:37:15,543 --> 00:37:18,878
But I believe in my men.

713
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,348
And I believe in the good that we're doing.

714
00:37:22,350 --> 00:37:23,850
Do you?

715
00:37:23,852 --> 00:37:28,388
Do you believe in your mission,
Captain Lance?

716
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:29,655
I do.

717
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:35,361
Well, then, don't regret
making in those tough decisions.

718
00:37:35,363 --> 00:37:36,763
Ma'am.

719
00:37:51,212 --> 00:37:52,412
Hey.

720
00:37:52,414 --> 00:37:53,913
Hey.

721
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,883
Just checking up on you.

722
00:37:56,885 --> 00:38:00,653
I don't feel like eating
anyone's brain, so...

723
00:38:00,655 --> 00:38:02,455
thank you.

724
00:38:02,457 --> 00:38:05,491
Well, maybe you feel
like eating a burger.

725
00:38:05,493 --> 00:38:07,660
No sprouts.

726
00:38:12,734 --> 00:38:13,666
What's wrong?

727
00:38:13,668 --> 00:38:16,469
Nothing.

728
00:38:16,471 --> 00:38:17,603
Well, there's a little something.

729
00:38:17,605 --> 00:38:19,510
I had to ask, didn't I?

730
00:38:19,535 --> 00:38:22,608
It's just, I don't think it's
any secret that without my suit,

731
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:24,610
I've been wondering what
my place on the team is.

732
00:38:24,612 --> 00:38:26,012
If...

733
00:38:26,014 --> 00:38:27,780
I even have a place, you know?

734
00:38:27,782 --> 00:38:30,049
Being an outsider is a good thing.

735
00:38:30,051 --> 00:38:32,385
It's a great thing.

736
00:38:32,387 --> 00:38:34,520
I've been an outsider my whole life.

737
00:38:34,522 --> 00:38:38,024
You get to tell people to go shove it.

738
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,172
What are you doing?

739
00:38:53,174 --> 00:38:56,042
Something I hope I don't regret.

740
00:39:00,148 --> 00:39:03,683
This belonged to the greatest
outsider I ever knew.

741
00:39:06,754 --> 00:39:09,188
I'm looking for a partner.

742
00:39:20,235 --> 00:39:21,634
Cool.

743
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,113
What on Earth are you doing?

744
00:39:34,115 --> 00:39:36,983
Oh, uh, scrimshaw.

745
00:39:36,985 --> 00:39:38,918
It's... was my mom's thing.

746
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:41,020
She taught me a little.

747
00:39:41,022 --> 00:39:42,588
Makes me think of her.

748
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:43,990
Oh.

749
00:39:43,992 --> 00:39:47,393
I had no idea.

750
00:39:47,395 --> 00:39:50,229
Are you homesick?

751
00:39:52,734 --> 00:39:54,734
You checking up on me, Grey?

752
00:39:54,736 --> 00:39:59,505
Given what you've witnessed,
what you've endured,

753
00:39:59,507 --> 00:40:02,775
would that really be so bad?

754
00:40:02,777 --> 00:40:03,976
No.

755
00:40:03,978 --> 00:40:07,747
You've just witnessed

756
00:40:07,749 --> 00:40:10,516
the very worst of humanity.

757
00:40:10,518 --> 00:40:12,852
We share a psychic connection,
but I still can't even

758
00:40:12,854 --> 00:40:17,290
begin to fathom what you must be feeling.

759
00:40:17,292 --> 00:40:20,293
It must be...

760
00:40:20,295 --> 00:40:23,095
like your heart is broken.

761
00:40:23,097 --> 00:40:26,299
Yeah. It is.

762
00:40:26,301 --> 00:40:29,669
But I saw something
in those people's eyes

763
00:40:29,671 --> 00:40:33,139
I... I didn't expect to see.

764
00:40:35,176 --> 00:40:37,160
I saw hope.

765
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:39,445
I saw dignity.

766
00:40:39,447 --> 00:40:41,314
Those men and women,

767
00:40:41,316 --> 00:40:43,816
they were treated worse than animals.

768
00:40:43,818 --> 00:40:48,454
But they never let anybody
stop them from being people.

769
00:40:48,456 --> 00:40:51,257
You know?

770
00:40:51,259 --> 00:40:54,727
I suppose there will always
be those who will seek to

771
00:40:54,729 --> 00:40:56,862
dehumanize us.

772
00:40:56,864 --> 00:40:59,231
But I believe there are more

773
00:40:59,233 --> 00:41:02,768
that cling to hope,

774
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:06,072
despite the darkness.

775
00:41:06,074 --> 00:41:09,976
Yeah, that is exactly how they were.

776
00:41:13,615 --> 00:41:16,582
I was actually thinking
of you, Jefferson.
