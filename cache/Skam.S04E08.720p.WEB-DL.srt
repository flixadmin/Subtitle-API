2
00:00:02,064 --> 00:00:06,000
- Seriously. I can’t be bothered. Just pass it.
- Seriously. I can’t be bothered.

3
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:17,075
Just come and get it.

4
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,000
- Yousef is meeting Noora.
- Seriously? Noora, Sana's friend?

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,008
Yes, Noora.

6
00:00:24,008 --> 00:00:27,016
- That sucks.
- He’s getting jealous!

7
00:00:28,088 --> 00:00:33,068
- There’s just something I have to tell you ...
- I know already.

8
00:00:33,076 --> 00:00:37,036
- What?
- The thing with Yousef.

9
00:00:37,044 --> 00:00:38,056
Do you like him?

10
00:00:38,064 --> 00:00:42,084
Just because you think a guy is cute,
doesn’t mean everyone else thinks so too.

11
00:00:42,092 --> 00:00:46,032
What the fuck is this?!

12
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,056
Why are you so cold towards people, Sana?

13
00:00:53,092 --> 00:00:56,096
Who’s your best bud, then?

14
00:00:57,004 --> 00:01:00,064
- I’m not sure if I have any anymore.
- Of course you do.

15
00:01:34,076 --> 00:01:38,016
There is nothing enthusing anymore,

16
00:01:38,024 --> 00:01:42,048
Or that feels like a real feeling.

17
00:02:33,062 --> 00:02:43,059
[Hi. There’s something I have to tell you.]

18
00:02:52,006 --> 00:03:02,055
[Hi. What are you doing today? 
Can we meet up?]

19
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:13,030
[I'm hungover af]

20
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:13,030
[Magnus and I are talking]

21
00:03:07,022 --> 00:03:13,030
[How are you doing Vilde?]

22
00:03:08,061 --> 00:03:13,030
[He thinks I’ve cheated on him with Elias.]

23
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:26,043
 [Vilde <3 We’re gonna kill those 
who made the hate account.
 Sana: I’m also hungover
 af and dad is visiting from
 Bergen to celebrate my 
18th birthday. Yippee!]

24
00:03:10,088 --> 00:03:16,043
[No Yippee]

25
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:26,043
[Plus fml]

26
00:03:26,047 --> 00:03:38,034
[Eva!! Mom said it’s okay
 for us to celebrate your
 18th birthday at my
 place on Friday!!]

27
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:38,034
[SHE DID?? Fucking hell!!]

28
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:38,034
[She asked why 
you couldn’t have it at your 
place, and I was like… ehhh.. 
they’re renovating]

29
00:03:38,034 --> 00:03:47,020
[After the last party]

30
00:03:42,078 --> 00:03:47,020
[Hahahaha!! Awesome!! 
Who are we going to invite??]

31
00:03:50,088 --> 00:03:56,020

32
00:03:52,056 --> 00:03:55,056
Hi.

33
00:04:07,076 --> 00:04:11,052
Talking to me?

34
00:04:15,024 --> 00:04:19,064
Sorry for being mad.

35
00:04:19,072 --> 00:04:23,044
So you’re no longer mad?

36
00:04:23,052 --> 00:04:27,092
That’s good. I thought
you were going to be mad for the rest of your life.

37
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,096
(Okay, are you ready?)

38
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:51,040
Why aren’t you friends
with Even anymore?

39
00:04:51,048 --> 00:04:56,016
No, the guy doesn’t want to be with us anymore -

40
00:04:56,024 --> 00:04:59,064
So we can’t make him.

41
00:05:03,076 --> 00:05:06,040
So it’s not because he ...

42
00:05:06,048 --> 00:05:10,016
... tried to kiss Mikael?

43
00:05:10,024 --> 00:05:14,084
Because I heard Mikael freaked out.

44
00:05:18,072 --> 00:05:22,052
That’s not why. It’s ...

45
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,020
A lot happened.

46
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,044
The guy just started
doing a lot of random stuff.

47
00:05:31,052 --> 00:05:36,016
Then he tried to
kiss Mikael, among other things.

48
00:05:36,024 --> 00:05:42,004
And we tried to get him to chill out,
but it didn’t work.

49
00:05:42,012 --> 00:05:44,084
Then he started to skip school, -

50
00:05:44,092 --> 00:05:51,048
And I talked to Sonja and
she told me he was depressed.

51
00:05:51,056 --> 00:05:55,092
And when she told us,
we tried to call him and text him a lot,

52
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,036
But ...

53
00:06:01,016 --> 00:06:05,048
It’s his deal if he -

54
00:06:05,056 --> 00:06:09,004
Doesn’t want to hang out with us.

55
00:06:09,056 --> 00:06:14,028

56
00:06:08,016 --> 00:06:12,024
You know he’s dating Isak?

57
00:06:25,036 --> 00:06:28,036

58
00:06:29,016 --> 00:06:32,088
I think he misses you guys.

59
00:06:42,096 --> 00:06:46,072
Because he asked
about you the other day.

60
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,028
He did?

61
00:06:51,028 --> 00:06:54,084
Tell him hi, then.

62
00:06:55,084 --> 00:06:59,068

63
00:06:54,052 --> 00:06:57,068
Hey?

64
00:07:07,076 --> 00:07:11,064
You know Yousef?

65
00:07:11,072 --> 00:07:14,072
Just forget about it.

66
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:20,048
I’m over him.

67
00:07:40,008 --> 00:07:45,052
... Yeah, but I’m wondering
if someone like planned it or...

68
00:07:54,076 --> 00:07:56,023
Yes, it seems like it.

69
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,032
Of course! With World Web Wide.

70
00:07:58,032 --> 00:08:03,099
What if that happened to one of you? Oh my God, it’d destroy you.

71
00:08:04,009 --> 00:08:06,073
Especially you! It’d ruin your whole reputation.

72
00:08:05,024 --> 00:08:08,008
Imagine just taking a picture ...

73
00:08:08,016 --> 00:08:11,056
It doesn't mean that! It just means you
forgot to take off the tag ...

74
00:08:11,064 --> 00:08:16,000
- You guys?
- Everyone! Ingrid answered.

75
00:08:16,008 --> 00:08:23,080
"We were sure Vilde made saranors2.
Again, sorry. We seriously feel so bad."

76
00:08:16,008 --> 00:08:34,012
*Eva is using an Oslo accent.

77
00:08:23,088 --> 00:08:28,028
"If we have ruined anything between
her and Magnus, we’re soooo sorry,"

78
00:08:28,036 --> 00:08:34,012
"- but it was Isak who started everything. You should me mad at him,
it’s so important that we stand together as one bus."

79
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,008
I just think it’s so weird that Isak -

80
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:42,048
Would make a hate account
on Sara. Like ... why?

81
00:08:42,056 --> 00:08:45,092
He’s probably pissed
at her for some reason.

82
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,056
I don’t know
what’s going on in Isak’s head, -

83
00:08:49,064 --> 00:08:55,000
But I actually thought he’d
changed. Apparently not.

84
00:08:55,008 --> 00:08:57,055
I’m really disappointed.

85
00:08:57,055 --> 00:08:58,090
What are you writing?

86
00:08:59,064 --> 00:09:05,032
"You can stand together, we’re out.
We won’t be on a bus with people who hate."

87
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,064
We’re without a bus again, then.

88
00:09:07,064 --> 00:09:09,025
She's saying ...

89
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,004
I know about a cheap van we can buy.

90
00:09:11,004 --> 00:09:15,072
"Hello! We have to talk before
you drop out of the bus."

91
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:18,048
What is there to talk about?

92
00:09:18,056 --> 00:09:23,025
If you make a hate account, I don’t
want to be friends with you.

93
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:29,004
There’s nothing to talk about!
Don’t you agree?

94
00:09:29,012 --> 00:09:31,020
People are totally crazy.

95
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,090
I think it has something to do with that Trump being the president.

96
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,072
You! You!

97
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:42,072
We thought we’d all chip in for this
for Eva’s birthday. Isn’t it cool?!

98
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,048
It’s six litres!

99
00:09:47,008 --> 00:09:51,016
You’re in, right?

100
00:10:04,048 --> 00:10:07,072
You know that saranors2 account?

101
00:10:13,076 --> 00:10:15,050
It was me.

102
00:10:44,044 --> 00:10:48,040
Do you think Eva will forgive me?

103
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,080
Do you have to tell?

104
00:10:58,088 --> 00:11:02,040
Of course I have to tell.

105
00:11:03,072 --> 00:11:07,076
She can’t go around
hating on Isak.

106
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:17,012
But that’s ... hate disappears ...

107
00:11:24,028 --> 00:11:28,004
It’s gone tomorrow.

108
00:12:00,043 --> 00:12:11,030
[Dear Eva. Please don’t be mad at Is ...]

[Sara Nørstelien has published 
something in Flawless 99]

111
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:46,040
EXTRAORDINARY BUS MEETING

We’re calling you in for an extraordinary bus meeting. Because there are oral exams tomorrow, and most people won’t be at school, we’ll take it on WEDNESDAY after school (SARA: IMPORTANT that EVERYONE comes, also the ones who have dropped out of the bus)

As you all know, there has been a lot of drama surrounding hate accounts lately. There are lots of rumors, and today I got a question from the teachers about it. I said nothing, of course, because we’d like to keep this outside of school. We remind you that this actually can lead to expulsion. It’s not worth it. It’s very important that everyone agrees we won’t involve the school in this, which is why it’s important to have a meeting. The meeting will take place on the benches outside the B-building kl 16 ON WEDNESDAY.

112
00:12:47,001 --> 00:12:54,090
[I honestly think it should be reported to the school.]

113
00:12:47,001 --> 00:12:54,090
[Me too.]

114
00:12:47,001 --> 00:12:54,090
[Come to the meeting and talk to us!! 
We haven’t had the opportunity to properly explain what’s happening]

115
00:12:56,052 --> 00:13:00,052

116
00:13:01,016 --> 00:13:04,076
Hey! You’ve reached Chris ...

117
00:13:17,086 --> 00:13:32,090
[Did you see the 
post on Flawless now? 
They’re talking about
 reporting it to the school, 
 I have to tell them it was me, 
Isak can be expelled]

118
00:13:36,021 --> 00:13:40,099
[It’s totally nerdy to report it to the school.]

119
00:13:36,021 --> 00:13:40,099
[I’ve made up with Isak, and he has apologized. I understand you’re angry with Ingrid and Lea for the ellevillevillde2 account, but talk to them. If they report it to the school, everything will be exposed and Isak can be expelled too. It’ll also be very bad for the bus.]

120
00:13:40,004 --> 00:13:43,004

Please leave a
message after the beep.

Hi, Eva.

127
00:14:12,016 --> 00:14:16,092
I just wanted ... I just called
to say I’m sorry again.

128
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:23,000
[Dear Sana, happy birthday
 to you and Jesus Christ*,
 you’re AWESOME!! We dig you
 and we love you a lot Sanasol! 
Love from Eva, Chris, Noora, Vilde]

129
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:23,000
*Sana was born on December 24th.
 (Norwegian Christmas)

130
00:14:17,092 --> 00:14:25,020
I’ve said sorry to everyone on the bus
that it was me, not Isak.

131
00:14:25,028 --> 00:14:30,016
And I’ve apologized to Sara.

132
00:14:31,016 --> 00:14:33,048
Yeah ...

133
00:14:33,056 --> 00:14:37,012
Yeah, that’s all I wanted to say.

134
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000

135
00:14:40,016 --> 00:14:42,020
- Hello?
- Hi.

136
00:14:52,028 --> 00:14:54,060
Have you talked to them?

137
00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:56,069
No, I haven’t talked to them yet.

138
00:14:57,028 --> 00:15:00,028
Nothing at all?

139
00:15:02,044 --> 00:15:05,044
No ... We chatted a bit.

140
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,040
Yes? What did they say?

141
00:15:11,048 --> 00:15:16,060
No, they’re a bit mad,
but I think it’ll pass soon.

142
00:15:16,068 --> 00:15:20,092
Just be honest. What did they write?

143
00:15:22,052 --> 00:15:25,052
Uh ...

144
00:15:27,084 --> 00:15:32,020
They wrote that
ever since the bus ...

145
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:36,020
That ...

146
00:15:37,096 --> 00:15:41,064
You’ve changed and that ...

147
00:15:44,012 --> 00:15:48,012
They don’t like you as much anymore. I don’t know.

148
00:15:58,004 --> 00:16:02,024
Do you know if they'll come
to the bus meeting tomorrow??

149
00:16:02,032 --> 00:16:05,060
I don’t know.

150
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,092
But I’ll be there.

151
00:16:17,096 --> 00:16:21,024
Don't be upset, okay?

152
00:16:23,068 --> 00:16:28,036
I'll get them to come to
the bus meeting. I promise.

153
00:16:28,044 --> 00:16:31,044
They’ll be there.

154
00:16:45,012 --> 00:16:47,076
I’ve tried to write something.

155
00:16:47,084 --> 00:16:50,096
- To them?
- Yes.

156
00:16:51,004 --> 00:16:53,068
What did you write?

157
00:16:53,076 --> 00:16:56,076
I wrote ...

158
00:16:58,004 --> 00:17:01,004
Hi.

159
00:17:03,048 --> 00:17:08,040
In the 9th grade,
there was a social worker

160
00:17:08,048 --> 00:17:12,036
- who told me
I had an anger issue.

161
00:17:12,044 --> 00:17:17,044
I thought: Fuck her,
she doesn’t understand shit. Because ...

162
00:17:17,052 --> 00:17:20,084
She didn’t understand shit.

163
00:17:22,028 --> 00:17:27,028
But now I’m wondering if
maybe she was right.

164
00:17:28,076 --> 00:17:31,044
Because I am angry.

165
00:17:31,052 --> 00:17:35,072
I’m angry because ...

166
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Because I’m not Muslim enough.

167
00:17:41,008 --> 00:17:46,008
And no matter what I do,
I’m never Norwegian enough.

168
00:17:46,016 --> 00:17:49,052
And I’m not Moroccan enough.

169
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:52,036
And I’m not chill enough.

170
00:17:52,044 --> 00:17:56,024
And I’m not pretty enough.

171
00:17:56,032 --> 00:18:02,016
I’m angry because I made it so
important to fit in on a russ bus.

172
00:18:02,024 --> 00:18:06,068
I’m angry because I don’t fit in anywhere.

173
00:18:06,076 --> 00:18:12,096
Because I always get angry
and fuck up.

174
00:18:13,004 --> 00:18:18,068
But most of all, I’m sad
because it affected you.

175
00:18:18,076 --> 00:18:23,016
Because that bus is not important to me.

176
00:18:23,024 --> 00:18:26,044
It’s not important to me to be Muslim enough, -

177
00:18:26,052 --> 00:18:33,072
Or if I fit in with Moroccans or Norwegians.

178
00:18:36,045 --> 00:18:48,000
[Because that bus is not 
 important to me. It’s not 
important to me to be Muslim 
enough, or if I fit in with Moroccans or
 Norwegians.

As long as I belong
 with you guys. The biggest losers
 in school.

I’m sorry for what I’ve
 done, I don’t give a shit 
if I’m expelled, just please,
 forgive me.
 
Sana]

179
00:19:08,032 --> 00:19:11,060
There is nothing enthusing anymore.

180
00:19:08,032 --> 00:19:15,055
[Are you coming?]

181
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:16,060
Or that feels like a real feeling.

182
00:19:16,068 --> 00:19:20,076
And it just started pouring down.

183
00:20:03,056 --> 00:20:07,028
Do you know if they’re coming?

184
00:20:07,036 --> 00:20:09,072
I think they’re coming.

185
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:14,044
Because it’s a bit meaningless without them.

186
00:20:14,052 --> 00:20:19,092
Everyone here agree we
won’t report it to the school?

187
00:20:20,068 --> 00:20:24,076
You agree too, right?

188
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:36,072
Did anyone have their last
class with them or something?

189
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,080
- No.
- Not me.

190
00:20:39,088 --> 00:20:43,024
I saw Eva during the break, at least.

191
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:53,036
They haven’t written
to you or anything?

192
00:20:54,048 --> 00:20:59,020
- No.
- Maybe you could try calling them?

193
00:21:16,076 --> 00:21:20,072

194
00:21:21,052 --> 00:21:27,052
Hey, you’ve reached Chris.
I can’t pick up the phone right now, sorry ...

195
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,076

196
00:21:43,072 --> 00:21:48,012
Hey, you’ve reached Chris.
I can’t ...

197
00:22:05,092 --> 00:22:09,088
But do you think Eva
and Vilde wanted to report it to the school?

198
00:22:13,096 --> 00:22:16,044
I don’t know.

199
00:22:16,052 --> 00:22:20,032
But they haven’t said anything about it?

200
00:22:22,032 --> 00:22:26,048
But they understand that
if they do that, we have to tell them -

201
00:22:26,056 --> 00:22:31,060
Why we made the Vilde account
and that’ll affect you too.

202
00:22:36,076 --> 00:22:39,088
I think they understand that.

203
00:22:45,032 --> 00:22:48,012
But seriously, how long are we supposed to be bothered with sitting here?

204
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:52,064
- It doesn’t seem like they’re coming.
- There’s not point in sitting here.

205
00:22:56,092 --> 00:23:00,092
What time is it anyway?

206
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
4.20 ...

207
00:23:08,012 --> 00:23:13,008
- Should we just leave, you guys?
- Yeah, let’s go.

208
00:23:15,004 --> 00:23:19,056
- Can you check when the 19 bus is coming?
- We can take this one.

209
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:24,076

210
00:23:19,004 --> 00:23:22,056
Let's go.

211
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:42,036
Sana! Sana!

212
00:23:42,044 --> 00:23:45,076
Sana!

213
00:23:45,084 --> 00:23:49,024
I hope you have room,
I hope you have room.

214
00:23:49,032 --> 00:23:52,028
I’m coming all by myself
and without any baggage.

215
00:23:52,036 --> 00:23:55,088
You can tell me to get it together
and put me in my place,

216
00:23:56,004 --> 00:23:59,028
- if you find a window for me.

217
00:23:59,036 --> 00:24:03,036
Catch me when I fall
or lose myself,

218
00:24:03,044 --> 00:24:06,008
- and the last flame or spark.

219
00:24:06,016 --> 00:24:09,052
I’ll let you finish crying
for a life at my expense

220
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:14,020
- if you find a window for me.

221
00:24:21,036 --> 00:24:24,096
Where did you get this?

222
00:24:25,004 --> 00:24:28,004
Was it you?

223
00:24:30,088 --> 00:24:33,096
If you fuck with Sana,
you fuck with us!

224
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,069
Bye Bitches!

225
00:24:35,068 --> 00:24:37,068
Bitches!

226
00:25:13,088 --> 00:25:17,072
We’re fasting.
We’re not having hotdogs.

227
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,090
Is that Fedon Lindberg,
or who is it?

228
00:25:22,076 --> 00:25:27,070
I’ve probably had chlamydia like thirteen times.

229
00:25:27,096 --> 00:25:34,004
- It’s like ... just take some antibiotics and it’s gone.
- Yeah.

230
00:25:34,012 --> 00:25:36,050
But in the eye?
I haven’t heard that one before.

231
00:25:38,028 --> 00:25:40,092
You can just do it from your side.

232
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Should I do it now?

233
00:25:47,072 --> 00:25:49,016
Bad hit!

234
00:25:53,012 --> 00:25:55,036
Awesome! Look what he did now!

235
00:25:55,036 --> 00:25:56,039
Hey guys.

236
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:58,000
- Hello!
- Hey.

237
00:25:59,036 --> 00:26:01,088
- Hey. Magnus.
- Elias.

238
00:26:01,096 --> 00:26:04,064
You know my girlfriend.

239
00:26:04,072 --> 00:26:07,067
- Oh ... the blonde one?
- Yeah.

240
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:59,079
Right! Yeah, yeah, yeah.
She has talked lots about you.

241
00:26:09,084 --> 00:26:11,027
- No, she has?
- Yeah, she talked about you a lot.

242
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,000
Ah!

243
00:26:14,088 --> 00:26:16,099
What does she say about me?

244
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,035
- Hey! Can I also have some?
- No!

245
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:12,040
- Please?
- You have your own drinks, you’re eighteen!

246
00:26:22,068 --> 00:26:26,096
- Exactly! I’m eighteen!
- Drink your own drinks!

247
00:26:27,004 --> 00:26:30,052
Should we play a drinking game? You, me and Chris since we’re looking to hook up tonight?

248
00:26:31,076 --> 00:26:36,060
- The drinking game of pointing.
- Pointing?

249
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,029
Okay, so we’re supposed to point at each other ...?

250
00:26:38,032 --> 00:26:43,036
It’s like ... “Most likely to ... fail their exams”

251
00:26:43,044 --> 00:26:46,088
... Happy birthday to you!

252
00:26:46,096 --> 00:26:52,036
Happy birthday to you!

253
00:26:52,044 --> 00:26:57,032
Happy birthday to you!

254
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:02,016
Happy birthday to you!

255
00:27:02,024 --> 00:27:05,080
Happy birthday!

256
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,044
You have three significant others!

257
00:27:10,052 --> 00:27:11,050
- That’s me!
- Do we have a knife so we can cut the cake?

258
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:14,050
Move it, move it, move it! We have a gift!

259
00:27:18,052 --> 00:27:22,080
Open it! Put down the cake!

260
00:27:22,088 --> 00:27:25,056
Open! Open! Open here!

261
00:27:25,064 --> 00:27:29,040
Open, open, open!

262
00:27:38,024 --> 00:27:41,056
What the fuck?!

263
00:27:45,048 --> 00:27:48,096
- Are you crazy?!
- It’s 1,5 ...

264
00:27:49,004 --> 00:27:52,096
- No, it’s 7,5!
- It’s six litres!

265
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:58,072
- Oh my God! Did you guys get this? I don’t know what to say.
- You’re going to open it now, right?

266
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,016

267
00:28:52,016 --> 00:28:57,075
- Open! Open! Open!
- Eva, come on, do it!

268
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,030
- Shake it!
- No,no, no!

269
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:48,008
- Hi.
- Hi.

270
00:29:49,008 --> 00:29:52,008
Here you’re sitting?

271
00:29:53,028 --> 00:29:56,052
Yeah. You get a bit tired when fasting.

272
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:59,060
Yeah, is it ...

273
00:29:59,068 --> 00:30:05,080
Is it going well? The fasting?

274
00:30:05,088 --> 00:30:11,056
Now there are only 3 hours,
14 minutes and 32 seconds left.

275
00:30:13,036 --> 00:30:16,008
Yeah ...

276
00:30:22,092 --> 00:30:25,023
- But I just ...
- But I just ...

277
00:30:30,056 --> 00:30:33,084
I just wanted to ...

278
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,088
I like Yousef.

279
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:50,056
You’re kidding? I knew it!

280
00:30:50,064 --> 00:30:55,064
And when I understood there
was something between you two ...

281
00:30:55,072 --> 00:30:59,040
No! There’s nothing between us.

282
00:31:00,072 --> 00:31:05,072
But there’s something between you.
I saw you guys hooking up.

283
00:31:10,048 --> 00:31:14,008
I can’t even be bothered.
Just look at this ...

284
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:20,008
From there.

285
00:31:20,076 --> 00:31:28,099
 [Hi sorry I just freaked out
 and suddenly took off 
yesterday. It didn’t have anything 
to do with you.]

[Don’t worry about it, 
sorry for being all over
 you, it didn’t have
 anything to do with you.]

[Haha ok]

[But I was just 
wondering one thing, have you
 talked to Sana?]

[Sana? No, what’s up?]

286
00:31:14,033 --> 00:31:18,099
 [if it’s okay if you maybe
 don’t say anything to her]

287
00:31:25,065 --> 00:31:28,099
[Is there something between you!?!!]

288
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:35,037
[No or I don’t know I like her a bit]

289
00:31:31,045 --> 00:31:35,037
 [But does she like you?!?! 
I’m FREAKING OUT here!
 I DIDN’T KNOW!!]

290
00:31:33,025 --> 00:31:51,093
 [No! Relax! I don’t
 think she likes me.
 Nothing has 
happened! We walked 
home together 
after you last Friday,
 and I thought maybe 
she liked me, but the next 
day she blocked
 me on Facebook, so I don’t
 think she’s that interested.]

291
00:31:35,037 --> 00:31:51,093
 [but anyway I don’t want
 her to think that I’m hooking 
up with her friends. 
Or hooking up with anyone.]

292
00:31:51,093 --> 00:32:02,000
 [Ok. I won’t say anything,
 after all, it was nothing.]

293
00:31:54,005 --> 00:32:02,000
 [you haven’t said anything? 
she’s super cold]

294
00:31:55,060 --> 00:32:02,000
[I haven’t said 
anything, but
 she’s a bit strange 
nowadays towards 
everyone. 
I think she’s really 
stressed about 
her mock exams …]

295
00:31:58,009 --> 00:32:02,000
 [Do you think maybe 
she heard about it 
from someone else?]

296
00:31:59,088 --> 00:32:02,000
 [I don’t know, I doubt it,
 I haven’t heard 
any rumors about it]

297
00:32:02,077 --> 00:32:24,000
 [Do you want me to try
 talking to her about you?]

298
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:24,000
[Yeah, maybe?]

299
00:32:09,017 --> 00:32:24,000
 [What are you going to say?]

300
00:32:10,093 --> 00:32:24,000
 [I can say that you like her.]

301
00:32:12,061 --> 00:32:24,000
 [Is that a good idea?]

302
00:32:14,089 --> 00:32:24,000
[At least then you’ll 
know if she 
likes you back.]

303
00:32:16,041 --> 00:32:24,000
 [Ok do that]

304

[Noora?]

306
00:32:21,001 --> 00:32:24,000
 [Hi, sorry. I sent her a
 text but I haven’t 
gotten a response..]

307
00:32:24,005 --> 00:32:38,073
 [What did you write?]

308
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:38,073
[Just that I wanted 
to tell her 
something nice.]

309
00:32:28,093 --> 00:32:38,073
[What are you doing? 
I seriously need 
some advice. 
I met Sana. I think 
she hates me.]

310
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:38,073
[I don’t want 
her to hate me. 
I swear that 
we’re soulmates.]

311
00:32:35,041 --> 00:32:38,073
[Aw <3 soulmates <3 
She doesn’t hate you]

312
00:32:38,073 --> 00:32:47,020
 [I wanted to tell her that
 I like her, but instead 
I was just an 
asshole and took 
her ball. 
Fuck am I 
12 or what]

313
00:32:41,061 --> 00:32:47,020
[I’m at st. hanshaugen

 if you want a therapist.]

 [What’s your number?]

314
00:32:33,002 --> 00:32:37,020
[Have you told 
Sana you like her?]

315
00:32:45,033 --> 00:32:47,020
[No?]

[Ok. We talked 
about you at
 school today.]

316
00:32:47,045 --> 00:33:05,000
[What did she say?]

 [I think she likes you.]

317
00:32:39,026 --> 00:32:55,000
[Did she say that?]

 [She said she didn’t,
 but she said it 
in a way that seemed 
like she did, if you
 know what I mean?]

318
00:32:52,000 --> 00:33:05,000
[No, I don’t 
understand shit.]

[Just forget it. 
don’t talk about 
me anymore.]

319
00:32:57,073 --> 00:33:05,000
[Ok :(]

320
00:33:59,064 --> 00:34:02,064

321
00:34:03,088 --> 00:34:06,068

322
00:34:06,076 --> 00:34:10,044
And please don’t be mad.

323
00:34:10,052 --> 00:34:13,052
