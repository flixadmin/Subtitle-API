1
00:00:30,063 --> 00:00:36,024
Walt! Martin! Let's get them back in
the bus before we all get fried out here.

2
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,659
Take it easy, Hix.

3
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,489
Just move.

4
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,029
Get him, Hix! Take him out, man!
Take him!

5
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:42,000
Go for it! Get out of here, man!

6
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:44,893
Right side!

7
00:01:47,073 --> 00:01:48,973
You got it! You got it!

8
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:52,267
You're out of here! All the way!

9
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:57,809
Oh, my gosh. He's dead.

10
00:01:57,984 --> 00:02:03,149
Damn it, Martin! Get on the horn!
Call this in!

11
00:02:03,756 --> 00:02:05,451
Tell them it's Hix.

12
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,593
He's loose.

13
00:02:08,495 --> 00:02:11,123
All right, Hix! All right!

14
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:12,592
Go for it!

15
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,727
That was great, Mom.

16
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:25,161
Always did love your corned beef
and cabbage.

17
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:28,830
So I gathered. Your knife and fork
were a blur during dinner.

18
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:32,375
I've seen sharks eat slower. And less.

19
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,445
I'm just a growing boy.

20
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:36,479
Why don't you go watch TV.

21
00:03:36,649 --> 00:03:39,311
- I'll clean up in here.
- No, Mom, leave it to me.

22
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:43,819
You and Dad go on in, I will be there
in a minute. Put that down.

23
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,885
I'm all right.

24
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:53,855
- Barry, clearing the table?
- Overeating. It's affecting his brain.

25
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:38,970
And stop.

26
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:41,270
Not bad.

27
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,319
So, what's your pleasure?

28
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:52,183
Golf, bowling, stock-car races?

29
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:55,651
Enough sports, Henry.
How about a movie?

30
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:57,728
Okay.

31
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:00,725
<i>The Babe Ruth Story</i>, channel 14.

32
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:04,202
I'll get it.

33
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,931
Wish this storm had knocked out
the telephone company.

34
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:12,706
Hello.

35
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,676
Well, say something, jerk,
I can hear you on the line.

36
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:20,045
I'm here, old man.

37
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:24,482
- Who is this?
- You thought you put me away for good.

38
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,421
- I'm back.
- Yeah.

39
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:31,529
- Well, what do you want?
- My due.

40
00:05:31,698 --> 00:05:36,158
You've got an outstanding debt.
I'm back to collect it.

41
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:40,896
You're gonna die, old man.
Real soon.

42
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:52,444
I bet you scared him to death,
huh, Johnny?

43
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:55,314
Nineteen years
and they're doing this now?

44
00:05:55,488 --> 00:05:56,955
What the hell happened here?

45
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,752
Wrong number.
Idiots can't dial right anymore.

46
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,989
Come here, Henry, listen to this.

47
00:06:06,165 --> 00:06:09,066
- Where's the houses?
- I'll find out, Johnny.

48
00:06:09,235 --> 00:06:11,999
You better. Find the houses.

49
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:14,468
Sure, sure.
Listen, I got the shooter you wanted.

50
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,076
- He's all lined up.
- Let's get the hell out of here.

51
00:06:20,513 --> 00:06:23,311
A mini-mall, huh?

52
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,580
<i>The storm is expected</i>
<i>to intensify though the night.</i>

53
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:34,283
<i>Travelers' advisories are out</i>
<i>throughout the county...</i>

54
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,621
<i>... and are expected to be in effect...</i>

55
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:38,821
Always a storm.
Get back to the movie.

56
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:42,126
I better hit the road. You know
how freaked Earl gets during storms.

57
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:43,734
Good night, Mom. Dad. Thanks.

58
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,803
- Good night.
- Good night. Drive carefully.

59
00:06:45,972 --> 00:06:47,735
You bet.

60
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:50,735
Since when is Earl afraid of storms?

61
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,879
Since it'll get Barry out of
cleaning up the dishes.

62
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:55,343
Right.

63
00:06:55,515 --> 00:06:58,040
I'd better go do it.

64
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:38,186
- Wait!
- I need money. Look at me.

65
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:41,485
Yeah, sure, Johnny.
Take as much as you want.

66
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:44,656
There's gonna be plenty soon, right?

67
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:47,857
Yeah. If you make sure
you find my houses.

68
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:51,663
It's straight, Johnny. I got it from
one of the guys who moved them.

69
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:54,204
They're all on a storage lot.
North side of town.

70
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:56,273
What about muscle? Gonna need lots.

71
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,740
I already talked to three.
They're all good guys.

72
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:02,108
- They can keep their mouths shut.
- Yeah.

73
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:04,374
What about my gunner?

74
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:06,784
Name's Gruber.

75
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:17,158
You just keep doing good work, Danny.

76
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,800
Bro.

77
00:08:26,105 --> 00:08:28,835
The man says you've got guns.
Is that right?

78
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:32,466
For sale. All you ever want.

79
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:37,314
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

80
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:41,112
Well, I suppose a man with
that many guns knows how to use them.

81
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,619
You got that right, pal.

82
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:47,491
Bang.

83
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:54,494
Yeah.

84
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:03,669
- You gonna help me out or not?
- Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.

85
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:07,745
Okay, get those pink Sonias over there.

86
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,109
No, not that one.

87
00:09:10,283 --> 00:09:13,047
The one next to it.
Sort of peachy color.

88
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,188
Why don't they call it
a peachy Sonia, if it isn't pink?

89
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:20,348
How come in baseball,
a ball that hits the foul pole is fair?

90
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,695
You got a point.

91
00:09:25,665 --> 00:09:28,566
- Leg acting up?
- Every now and again.

92
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:30,827
I've been thinking about
when that happened.

93
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:36,532
Yeah? Not a day that I don't think
about that miserable piece of work.

94
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,301
Johnny Ray Hix.

95
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:44,109
Came blowing out of the back of that bank
and drilled me before I turned the corner.

96
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,977
He was gonna kill me.

97
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,786
- Till you showed up.
- I should never have let you...

98
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,423
...go back around there alone
in the first place.

99
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,458
It wasn't your fault, Henry.

100
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,725
Anyway, look on the upside.

101
00:09:56,896 --> 00:10:01,424
The leg got me transferred
to a cushy desk in Records.

102
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,069
And besides, you got Hix.

103
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:07,797
- Got him good.
- Yeah, chased him for three blocks.

104
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:10,969
Damn near killed him when I caught him.

105
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,504
You know, it still burns me
that we never found the money.

106
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,108
Nearly 600 thou.

107
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,252
I hope he rots in a cell till doomsday.

108
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:27,225
He's out, Pete.

109
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,187
And he's in town.

110
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,227
What?

111
00:10:32,698 --> 00:10:35,963
Broke away from a road gang
the day of that storm.

112
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,729
- That was Hix?
- Called me.

113
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:42,071
Said he was gonna kill me.

114
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,472
- Who'd you tell about this?
- Nobody.

115
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:49,479
I wasn't gonna get Nora and Barry
all riled over a phone call.

116
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,276
You talked to the station?

117
00:10:51,917 --> 00:10:55,580
Lookit, he's a con on the run.
He's probably miles away by now.

118
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:59,691
Besides, I'm not gonna go whining
for protection when nothing's happened.

119
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:02,327
No, we'll handle this ourselves.

120
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:08,127
- Who's "we"?
- Allen and Donello. That's who.

121
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,393
You been sniffing the ant spray?

122
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:13,504
Hix has got 20 years
and a bellyful of hate on us.

123
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,403
And we got a lifetime of
police work on him.

124
00:11:16,575 --> 00:11:20,375
- You with me, Pete?
- Well, sure. But that Hix, he's crazy.

125
00:11:20,546 --> 00:11:23,140
- What if he...?
- Let him.

126
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:26,079
I'll nail him a second time.

127
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:34,819
I don't know how to explain it exactly,
he's just not himself the past few days.

128
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:37,758
A little bit more to the right.

129
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:42,125
He's on edge and he's a little distracted.
A little bit higher.

130
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:44,394
- Now, that's perfect. Hold it.
- Okay.

131
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,197
Let's put in nails.

132
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,175
- Here you go.
- Well, maybe it's retirement.

133
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,435
You know? A delayed reaction.

134
00:11:53,913 --> 00:11:56,381
I mean, suddenly he finds himself
with nothing to do.

135
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:58,907
Maybe. All he seems to wanna do lately...

136
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:03,681
...is talk to his old pals on the force
or listen to the police-band radio.

137
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:05,585
Picture's crooked.

138
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:09,225
For your information, I'm fine.

139
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:13,627
Well, yeah, we were just wondering
if maybe you were a little bored.

140
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:17,758
Sort of... Well, I mean,
now that you're no longer on the force.

141
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:22,203
Oh, I suppose a little.
Not much going on nowadays.

142
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,015
- Everybody all right?
- Yeah.

143
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:37,314
- Yeah? Mom?
- Yes, I'm fine.

144
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:28,736
Excuse me, folks.
Could you please stay back?

145
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:39,916
Okay, Bob.
Take this to Ballistics, will you.

146
00:13:40,352 --> 00:13:44,550
- Henry, this is insane.
- Getting out of harm's way is stupid?

147
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:48,591
No, me leaving is fine.
You staying is insane.

148
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,821
There's plenty of room
at my sister's house for both of us.

149
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:55,758
Nora, I'm staying, and that's final.
Besides, I hate St. Louis.

150
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,926
I'm not too crazy about your sister either.

151
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:00,901
Barry, can you talk some sense
into this man?

152
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:05,476
Well, probably not.
But I do have an idea.

153
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:09,740
Since Dad won't leave,
why doesn't he move in with me.

154
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:13,183
- That's as bad...
- I don't need a babysitter. Especially you.

155
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,512
Hold it!

156
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,918
It's a good idea.
Dad will be safe with me.

157
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:20,820
- Look, I am a cop!
- In a lab coat.

158
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:25,755
Besides, Hix doesn't know
you'll be with me or where I live.

159
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,027
- Henry?
- Never.

160
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:34,369
Then turn around and take those bags
right upstairs. I am not leaving.

161
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,872
Okay. All right. Get them, Larry.
Get them.

162
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,306
All right, I'll stay with Barry.

163
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:42,140
Come here, Mom.
I'll take good care of him.

164
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:45,613
- You promise?
- I promise.

165
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:49,181
Now, don't worry about me, Nora.

166
00:14:49,588 --> 00:14:53,319
I'll walk you out to the squad car.
The boys will drive you down to the airport.

167
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:57,021
The car was stolen.
It was taken from a motel last night.

168
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,527
So, what else is new?

169
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:02,497
- Any prints?
- It was a glove job.

170
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:06,669
Oh, man, this is some bad business.

171
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,137
Man, this is my house!

172
00:15:09,475 --> 00:15:11,773
It's where I grew up.

173
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:18,311
How much time you got here?

174
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:21,044
- Like an hour or two.
- Stay with my dad till I get back.

175
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,586
I'll pick him up here
and take him to my apartment.

176
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:25,621
- We'll get something to eat later.
- Wait.

177
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,123
- Aren't you going out with Tina?
- That's right.

178
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:31,161
I'll figure out something.
Gotta run.

179
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,026
- Where you going?
- Hunting.

180
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:53,945
- Come on. Give me an eight.
- Here we go, here we go.

181
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:58,618
Come on.

182
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,589
Hard six! That's my baby.

183
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:11,168
- Get out of here!
- Hey, man, let's get out of here.

184
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:14,395
Hey, take the money, man.
I don't care.

185
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:15,972
I'm looking for someone.

186
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:19,372
- Johnny Ray Hix. You know him.
- Hix. Yeah, I know Hix.

187
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:23,345
Served time with him.
But I haven't seen him for over 10 years.

188
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:27,144
- You know he's out.
- I heard. Yeah, I heard.

189
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:31,119
But lookie here, man.
Hix is worst I ever met.

190
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,259
I see Johnny Ray Hix coming,
and I'm heading the other way.

191
00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:36,326
Look at me!

192
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:39,027
I want him.

193
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,498
You find out anything, you tell a cop,
I'll get the word.

194
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,533
You don't...

195
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,905
...you lose.

196
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:58,042
- Here's your change.
- Thank you.

197
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:08,717
<i>Daily Star</i>.

198
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:12,661
It's a 5.

199
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,232
Bull. It's a 10.

200
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:20,201
- How you doing, Barry?
- Good, Reg.

201
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,331
- Here's your change.
- No, keep it.

202
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:25,636
Oh, thanks. Word's out
you're looking for Hix.

203
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:28,279
Yeah, and I got nothing.

204
00:17:28,447 --> 00:17:30,312
- Heard anything?
- No.

205
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:32,450
Drums say he's still in town, though.

206
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,685
Well, that's something, I guess.

207
00:17:34,853 --> 00:17:36,343
Why can't I get a bead on him?

208
00:17:36,622 --> 00:17:39,352
You gotta remember,
anybody who gets in bed with Hix...

209
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:42,119
...they get real loyal and real quiet.

210
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:44,785
Otherwise they get real... dead.

211
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:49,024
Good point. Well, if you do hear...

212
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:53,137
Anything, it's yours.
I owe your dad from way back.

213
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:55,500
- How is he?
- Dad?

214
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,904
He's fine.

215
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:01,710
- In fact, I gotta go pick him up.
- Well, give him my best, you hear?

216
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:05,539
Hey, hey! Hey, you forgot your paper!

217
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:09,214
What can I say, I got my orders.

218
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:12,653
If the man says to check
the gas main under this lot...

219
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:14,520
...well, that's what I gotta do.

220
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:17,218
I don't know.
I didn't get a work order on this.

221
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:18,920
Listen, the main has got a leak.

222
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,590
If it blows, this lot's gonna be spread
across the whole county.

223
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,532
But if it makes you feel better,
waste more time.

224
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:29,834
- Go ahead, call it in.
- No, no. That's okay. You guys do your job.

225
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:32,408
I got the weekend off anyway.

226
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:35,809
Well, thanks, pal.
You saved us both a lot of headaches.

227
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:39,610
- You guys lock up when you leave, now.
- Oh, you bet.

228
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:41,952
Come on, Gus!

229
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,250
Let's go!

230
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,758
Which house is it?

231
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:54,557
I don't know.

232
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,466
It's a lot of years.

233
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:01,230
It's in a wall space.

234
00:19:01,874 --> 00:19:05,275
It's an outside wall. We're gonna
have to check every one of these.

235
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:07,844
Now, let's get to it.

236
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:21,988
So how long were you
a police officer, Mr. Allen?

237
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,858
For 41 years. How's that coming, Barry?

238
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:29,991
It's...

239
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,330
...great. It's...

240
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,870
Yeah, it's fine.

241
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,242
Voilá.

242
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:42,612
You sure burned the hell
out of those shrimps.

243
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:45,978
They're not burned.
They're blackened.

244
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:47,880
They're supposed to look like that.

245
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:51,352
I lived with your mother long enough
to know what burned looks like.

246
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:55,892
No. Well, Dad, anyway,
I was telling you that Tina is the doctor...

247
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,427
...who treated me after my accident.

248
00:19:58,897 --> 00:20:02,993
- Oh, yeah? Doctor, huh? What kind?
- Well, I'm an M.D., of course.

249
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:05,996
But most of my work recently
has been fairly varied.

250
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:10,164
Researching paragenetic enhancement,
experimental anthropobionics...

251
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:13,543
...subnucleic biochemistry,
that sort of thing.

252
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,510
- What the hell language was that?
- Dad!

253
00:20:16,682 --> 00:20:20,174
- It is a bit of a mouthful, isn't it?
- See, even she admits it.

254
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:21,785
You should relax.

255
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:24,548
I understand you're a little nervous
on the first date.

256
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,315
No, I told you, it's not a date.

257
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:29,786
- Really.
- It's a good thing that you're here, Tina.

258
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:34,023
If he took you out, you might have to
go through that restaurant thing of Barry's.

259
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:36,429
- Restaurant thing?
- Now, wait a minute.

260
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:40,795
Every time Barry goes to a restaurant,
he doesn't really handle it too well.

261
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:44,966
Now, come on, Dad, that was a long time
ago. I'm sure Tina is not interested in that.

262
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:48,874
The minute we'd get to one,
you know, Barry would get sick.

263
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:53,643
I remember one time we went
to Barton's Cafeteria, and he let it go.

264
00:20:53,819 --> 00:20:55,787
- Oh, God.
- Barry, are you all right?

265
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:58,580
Yeah, fine.

266
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:05,058
Hey, you trying to kill us?

267
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,095
Sorry.

268
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,427
I never expected
a water hazard at dinner.

269
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,033
Water hazard? You play golf?

270
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:15,002
Any chance I can get. You?

271
00:21:15,173 --> 00:21:18,802
- It's my passion.
- What kind of woods do you use?

272
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:21,445
- Fairway Classics.
- Me too.

273
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,808
- Have you seen their new wedge?
- No.

274
00:21:28,353 --> 00:21:32,084
- You okay?
- Yeah, just a little cramp.

275
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:34,623
- Here, Earl. Come here, boy.
- Is Earl here?

276
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:38,058
Hey, come here, boy.
I've got some burned shrimp for you.

277
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,822
Oh, the wedge. It's so great.

278
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:43,058
- The beryllium head, the 60-degree loft.
- Terrific.

279
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:45,169
- You hear that, Barry?
- That's perfect.

280
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:47,635
- What's that red thing in his mouth?
- His leash.

281
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,741
He wants to go for a run.
We'll be back later.

282
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:53,742
Mr. Allen, I'm having a little trouble
with my slice.

283
00:21:53,912 --> 00:21:57,712
Yeah, well, you gotta
roll the right hand over.

284
00:21:59,451 --> 00:22:02,181
Stay out of my closet, all right?

285
00:22:13,031 --> 00:22:15,829
Hair samples matched
the car's registered owner.

286
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,128
- Nothing new here.
- Same with the shells.

287
00:22:18,303 --> 00:22:19,793
- Yeah.
- Standard 9 mm.

288
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:23,668
Fits all Mac-10s and Tec-9s.
That narrows it down.

289
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,675
Yeah. Can't be more than
a couple thousand of those in town.

290
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:30,804
Dad! Careful, that's hydrochloric acid.

291
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:33,649
I wasn't gonna drink it.

292
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:36,447
Seems to me you've drunk worse
in your day.

293
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:39,089
Hey, Pete!

294
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:43,524
Hey, Pete. You remember my son, Barry.

295
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,755
- Oh, sure do. How are you, son?
- Fine, Mr. Donello.

296
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:49,594
I'd like you to meet my colleague,
Julio Mendez.

297
00:22:49,768 --> 00:22:52,669
- Julio, Mr. Donello.
- Just Pete.

298
00:22:52,838 --> 00:22:56,797
Listen, I didn't mean to break anything up
here. I just stopped by to see Henry.

299
00:22:56,975 --> 00:23:00,206
Yeah, welcome to my jail.
Come on, we'll talk.

300
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:04,475
Let the science boys
go back to their toys.

301
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,216
I think I got something, Henry.

302
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,978
That's great, Peter. What?

303
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:12,715
A name from Hix's file.

304
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:15,086
Danny Duffy.

305
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:18,355
- Duffy.
- Yeah, you remember.

306
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:22,022
The wheelman. The kid.
We got him at the bank that day.

307
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,829
- Duffy went up for 18 months.
- Where is he now?

308
00:23:26,004 --> 00:23:29,462
I thought you might ask.
He's got a bar.

309
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:34,601
Place over on Con's Avenue. Danny D's.

310
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,844
Barry, Pete and I are gonna go downstairs
and get a cup of coffee.

311
00:23:40,018 --> 00:23:43,317
Yeah. Okay.
Don't leave the building, all right?

312
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:45,456
Yes, sir.

313
00:23:46,458 --> 00:23:48,722
You know, it's really weird.

314
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:53,524
Time piles up. Suddenly you're
the parent, they're the kids.

315
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:57,065
- That's the way of the world, man.
- I guess.

316
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,706
- Just drop me off.
- I don't know, Henry.

317
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:09,608
- Maybe I should go in with you.
- I'll be okay. I know that drill.

318
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:12,545
Besides, this one's all mine.

319
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:14,517
- Damn it!
- What's the matter?

320
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:16,984
My father, that's what's the matter.

321
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:39,237
You took a wrong turn, dad.
Legion hall's around the corner.

322
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:42,744
Duffy. Duffy, I'm talking to you.

323
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:46,441
- I want Hix.
- I can't hear you, man.

324
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,624
You hear me now?

325
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:56,923
I'm looking for Hix, damn it!

326
00:24:57,095 --> 00:25:01,794
- Now you pay for the jukebox.
- Can anyone get in this game?

327
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:05,032
God, it's him. He's real.

328
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,299
Get down!

329
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:31,388
Looking for this?

330
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:45,373
- Where is Hix?
- I haven't seen Hix.

331
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,774
He's lying!

332
00:25:49,114 --> 00:25:52,550
If you are, I'm gonna put you
behind the eight ball.

333
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:11,862
Barry! Did you see him?
The Flash guy, he exists...!

334
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:13,334
Where'd you come from?

335
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,540
Me? I followed you here
from the lab.

336
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:19,677
You promised me you wouldn't leave.
I gotta get you out of here.

337
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:23,610
Yeah, but this guy is something. If we
had a half a dozen like him on the force...

338
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:26,876
...there wouldn't be a criminal
left in this whole city.

339
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:40,157
Yeah. Three blocks.

340
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:45,631
Henry chased you three full blocks.

341
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:54,709
Here's the only place
you could have dumped it.

342
00:26:56,648 --> 00:27:02,609
One of those boarded-up homes
that they moved outside of town.

343
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:13,361
You always were the smart one, Donello.

344
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:19,901
570,000 big ones.

345
00:27:27,379 --> 00:27:31,145
I can't turn my back on that, can I?

346
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:36,480
What I really wanna thank you for is this.

347
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,020
My treasure map.

348
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:40,421
And this.

349
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:44,761
Allen's with his kid, huh?

350
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,095
I found this under the lawn chair.

351
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:30,332
- Thought you might wanna hold on to it.
- Hix's file.

352
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:32,442
So he and Dad...

353
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,010
They just couldn't let go.

354
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:48,687
- Henry.
- Lieutenant.

355
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:55,727
Pete didn't have a wife or kids.

356
00:28:56,534 --> 00:28:59,025
I thought you might wanna have these.

357
00:28:59,804 --> 00:29:01,931
His gun and badge.

358
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:06,935
- Thanks.
- We found them inside.

359
00:29:07,378 --> 00:29:10,347
I knew Pete Donello myself
for over 20 years.

360
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:14,076
We're gonna make Hix pay.
You've got my promise on that.

361
00:29:14,953 --> 00:29:18,354
Nobody wants to lose
another good cop, Henry.

362
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:23,153
So you stay close to your boy.
Head down, watch your back, okay?

363
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:29,629
Dad?

364
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:36,435
I never should have
dragged Pete into this.

365
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,542
He was right.

366
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:42,373
A couple old men
can't go back out on the street.

367
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:45,512
I killed him, Barry.

368
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,513
You can't blame yourself.

369
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:50,853
There's only one thing to do now.

370
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:52,990
Get Hix.

371
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,167
Take a look at these.
You might find them interesting.

372
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:13,277
Look. See, these are shots of the mud
around Pete's garden.

373
00:30:13,444 --> 00:30:16,902
Now, the ground was still soft
when we took these...

374
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:21,450
...so I think we may get
some interesting prints from this.

375
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:25,180
Okay, Barry. According to the size of
the wound and the shape of the blade...

376
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:29,759
...the weapon that killed Mr. Donello
is a hunting knife.

377
00:30:29,928 --> 00:30:31,919
All right, that's something.

378
00:30:32,096 --> 00:30:35,293
We can have the Homicide boys
check the surplus stores for purchases.

379
00:30:35,466 --> 00:30:37,764
- Yeah.
- I don't believe this.

380
00:30:37,936 --> 00:30:40,097
What? We've got a good solid lead here.

381
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:44,503
Who cares what kind of knife killed Pete?
He's dead. That's what matters!

382
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,907
- Well, wait a minute, there's...
- No, no. You wait!

383
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,944
You seem to be pretty good at it.

384
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:52,173
One of the best men
I've ever known is dead.

385
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:55,842
And all I get from you is footprints
and coroners' reports.

386
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,282
Let me tell you something.

387
00:30:57,455 --> 00:31:01,221
All the chemicals and all the microscopes
in the world won't bring Pete back!

388
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:03,519
He's dead, Barry!

389
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:07,094
Everybody in the whole damn world
knows who killed him...

390
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:09,631
...and I have to sit here and listen to this!

391
00:31:10,134 --> 00:31:15,868
I gotta go down to the storeroom
for a minute. We're short on beakers.

392
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:21,335
Did you ever...

393
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:24,673
...for one single minute, stop and think...

394
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:30,048
...that I might get a little sick and tired of
your endless criticism of me and my work?

395
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:33,580
I am doing the best I know how here.

396
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:36,318
And you're not getting
a step closer to Hix.

397
00:31:36,494 --> 00:31:38,826
Well, what am I supposed to do, huh?

398
00:31:38,997 --> 00:31:41,966
You seem to know, so clue me in here.
What should I do?

399
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:44,067
You get out on the streets!

400
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,635
You turn the town upside down
looking for Hix!

401
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:49,500
If you can't find him,
you find somebody that knows him...

402
00:31:49,674 --> 00:31:53,166
...and you kick his butt. You keep kicking
till he tells you what you want!

403
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:57,246
Is that all being a cop means to you?
Turning on a siren and pulling a gun?

404
00:31:57,548 --> 00:32:01,609
Law enforcement has made a few advances
in the last 25 years, you know.

405
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:04,880
I knew how to do good police work,
but you...

406
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:06,785
And I don't?

407
00:32:08,993 --> 00:32:11,723
- Look, look, Barry...
- Just drop it.

408
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:23,831
Barry, maybe we dropped it too long.

409
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,078
Let's take a walk, son.

410
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:40,991
Barry, I've always gone at things,
well, pretty straight ahead.

411
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:44,651
You know, the physical, rough.

412
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:46,922
Now you sound like Jay talking.

413
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:49,157
Yeah, I guess it does.

414
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:53,168
But when Jay went through the academy
and became an officer, well...

415
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:56,239
...I knew what he was doing
every day, you know?

416
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:59,001
How he thought, what he was up to.

417
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:02,772
I always understood your brother, Barry.

418
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:07,809
But as much as I loved Jay,
I never loved you any less.

419
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:14,088
But you... Well, you, Barry,
you were different.

420
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:19,028
I mean, you were smart, you know,
reading all the time.

421
00:33:19,197 --> 00:33:22,496
Hell, you were the first Allen
to go all through college.

422
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,761
And now look at you, a scientist.

423
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:30,033
Doing things I can't imagine,
I don't even understand.

424
00:33:33,478 --> 00:33:36,379
Do you know
what I'm trying to say, Barry?

425
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:41,782
Yeah, I think so, Dad.

426
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:47,418
Well, maybe we should be
getting on home.

427
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:49,488
Yeah.

428
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:55,324
You know, I think I'm gonna be
working late tonight.

429
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,731
You gonna be all right
a few hours on your own?

430
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:01,901
I'll be fine, Mother.

431
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:21,658
- <i>and heavy cream with salt and egg yolk</i>
<i>until they are golden brown.</i>

432
00:34:21,826 --> 00:34:23,487
<i>Naturally, a very good side dish...</i>

433
00:34:23,661 --> 00:34:26,152
What's the matter, pal?

434
00:34:29,534 --> 00:34:32,731
Stay down. Stay down, Earl. Stay down.

435
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:46,146
You took my life, Allen!
Now I'm gonna take yours.

436
00:34:50,621 --> 00:34:53,146
Twenty lousy years.

437
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:56,049
That's a bad place to grow up, Allen.

438
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:04,524
Are you listening to me, old man?
I want you to hear this.

439
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:07,762
After I kill you,
I'm gonna kill your son.

440
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,068
No more Allen cops!

441
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:32,829
That was close, Johnny Ray!
I thought he was gonna nail you.

442
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:35,864
Shut up! Just make sure you nailed him.

443
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:37,967
Yeah.

444
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:11,397
How long before the x-rays are back?

445
00:36:11,769 --> 00:36:13,464
I understand.

446
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:16,869
Okay, then I'll be by to pick him up
in about an hour.

447
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:19,703
- Righto. Thanks, doc.
- Well, how is he?

448
00:36:19,877 --> 00:36:21,640
He took a few pellets in his arm...

449
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:24,372
...but the worst is the whack
on his head when he fell.

450
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:26,813
- He's got a mild concussion.
- Other than that?

451
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:30,483
Well, he's depressed, quiet.
Not like him.

452
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:33,681
It's a two-way gunfight
and all he gets is a crease in his helmet?

453
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:36,986
I'm sorry, that's one tough old man.

454
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:40,163
Keep cranking on what we got.
I can't sit around here.

455
00:36:40,331 --> 00:36:42,629
- Where you going?
- To the gym.

456
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:01,409
Yeah!

457
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:15,693
I want a damn lawyer!

458
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:17,925
Can you hear me out there?
A lawyer.

459
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:20,832
Pipe down in there.

460
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:30,210
- This whole thing's a setup.
- Worked, too.

461
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:33,714
- What...?
- You're in here. Hix is a free man.

462
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:37,545
- Who are you, man?
- You know me.

463
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:39,155
From last night.

464
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,825
Hey, help me! Somebody's in here!

465
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:46,657
Call them. And when they come,
I'll be gone.

466
00:37:46,964 --> 00:37:48,727
But then I'll just come back.

467
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,095
- Where's Hix?
- Please, man.

468
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,965
I don't know about him.
Just some guy I met at Danny's.

469
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:56,834
Said he'd pay me 10 grand
if I'd do a trigger for him.

470
00:37:57,008 --> 00:38:00,034
- How does Hix have money like that?
- I don't know, man. I swear!

471
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:12,956
Who's bankrolling him?

472
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:16,423
It doesn't make sense that
he could offer Gruber $ 10,000.

473
00:38:16,594 --> 00:38:21,429
Maybe he knocked off another bank.
He was always good at that.

474
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:24,867
The bank robbery.

475
00:38:26,003 --> 00:38:28,836
The missing money. That's it!
It's gotta be.

476
00:38:29,006 --> 00:38:33,375
He's still going after the money
all these years, and Pete figured it out.

477
00:38:33,544 --> 00:38:36,638
I wondered what this
old city map was for.

478
00:38:37,648 --> 00:38:40,549
Hey, Dad, look at this highlighted part.

479
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:42,845
The streets where you chased him.

480
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:45,488
Now, see where Pete marked it?
What is that?

481
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:49,490
That's Fifth and McCullum.

482
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,860
Boarded-up houses. Been there for years.

483
00:38:52,029 --> 00:38:54,293
Not anymore. The whole block's
under construction.

484
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:57,866
The houses have been moved out
for relocation.

485
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:02,138
So Hix is having trouble
getting to his money, huh?

486
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,199
We got him.

487
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:09,073
For the first time in this whole lousy deal,
we know where he is.

488
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:13,183
Hey, Dad, come on. We got him.

489
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:16,586
Yeah, fine.
Call it in and have him picked up.

490
00:39:16,754 --> 00:39:19,814
It doesn't much matter to me anymore.

491
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:23,385
Don't you think we should be there?

492
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:26,858
I mean, after all he's done.

493
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,591
After all I let him do.

494
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,163
Shooting up our house,
endangering your mother.

495
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:36,936
Then I dragged Pete in.

496
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:39,099
Look around. Look at the damage.

497
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:42,446
Barry, he came here to kill you too.

498
00:39:44,281 --> 00:39:45,646
You're right.

499
00:39:45,816 --> 00:39:48,649
Who the hell do I think I am?

500
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,719
I'm too old for any of this.

501
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:00,626
What are you doing?

502
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,930
- I'm going after him.
- No, Barry.

503
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:06,934
You're right about Hix.
The grief he's brought us.

504
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:09,038
I'm gonna bring him in.

505
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:11,367
I'm not letting you go out there alone.

506
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:16,041
Then come with me.

507
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:26,483
All right, son. Let's end it now.

508
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:33,160
- Hix! There's something here.
- Get it out of there!

509
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,025
Get it out of there!

510
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,566
- Pull! Pull!
- There it is.

511
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:41,569
- Got it!
- We got company.

512
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:46,401
Get them!

513
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:04,026
Nice shot.

514
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:06,755
- How many?
- I made four.

515
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:09,764
- Three to go.
- Right.

516
00:41:10,201 --> 00:41:12,692
- Let's separate.
- Right.

517
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,576
Sleep tight.

518
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,715
Hix!

519
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,088
Come on, Hix!

520
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:44,227
How's it feel,
someone coming after you?

521
00:42:44,695 --> 00:42:47,425
Come on, old man. Come and get it!

522
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:21,995
I got him.
The porch must have been rotted out.

523
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:24,327
That's not the only thing.

524
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:27,129
The money must have been stored
next to a water pipe.

525
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:31,434
I called in. Cars are on the way.
I'm gonna go check on the one I wounded.

526
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:35,170
- Okay, Hix...
- Say your prayers, Allen.

527
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:46,187
Barry! Barry!

528
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:52,595
Up! Get up!

529
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:56,426
Barry! Barry! It's over!

530
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,569
It's over. He's beaten.

531
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:01,526
Yeah.

532
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,307
You know, I can't figure it out.

533
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:15,316
If this Flash is a good guy,
why doesn't he wanna show himself?

534
00:44:15,853 --> 00:44:19,721
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe one day he will.

535
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:21,187
Come on.

536
00:44:21,358 --> 00:44:23,849
We gotta knock off and go pick up Mom
at the airport.

537
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:28,692
Yeah. Well, listen, there's something
I've been wanting to say to you, son.

538
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:32,324
That was a brave thing you did
out there, taking on Hix.

539
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:35,097
- That was brave and dangerous.
- Well, while I doing it...

540
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:38,435
...I felt like I could have killed him.
- Yeah, I know.

541
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:41,578
I felt that way a thousand times
when I was on duty.

542
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:43,343
It's part of being a cop.

543
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,574
You gotta do your job
and keep your feelings in.

544
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:52,813
What I'm trying to say, Barry...

545
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:56,689
...is you are a cop.
And a good one.

546
00:44:57,161 --> 00:45:01,393
You may be different than I was,
or Jay.

547
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:03,858
Hell.

548
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:07,929
None of this is easy
for a dumb old Irishman.

549
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:11,130
Sounds great to me.

550
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,631
