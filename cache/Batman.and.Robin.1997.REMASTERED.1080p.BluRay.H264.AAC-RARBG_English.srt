1
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:19,423
Robin: I want a car.

2
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:23,428
Chicks dig the car.

3
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:26,389
This is why Superman works alone.

4
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:38,359
Do try and bring this one
back in one piece, sir!

5
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,598
Don't wait up, al.

6
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,809
I'll cancel the pizzas.

7
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:31,625
Batman, a new villain has
commandeered the Gotham museum.

8
00:03:31,837 --> 00:03:33,702
He's frozen the antiquities wing.

9
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,330
He's turned
the security guards into ice.

10
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,840
He's calling himself, "Mr. freeze."

11
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,841
Mr freeze.

12
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,735
Man 1: Stop!
Man 2: Drop your weapon!

13
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,240
Man 3: Stop or we'll shoot!

14
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:23,676
The iceman cometh.

15
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,514
Please, show some mercy.

16
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,008
Mercy?!

17
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:36,023
I'm afraid that my condition has
left me cold to your pleas of mercy.

18
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,875
In this universe.

19
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,544
There's only one absolute.

20
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,169
Everything...

21
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:04,050
Freezes.

22
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,675
Hi, freeze. I'm Batman.

23
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,995
You're not sending me to the cooler.

24
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,554
- Nice catch.
- You break it, you buy it.

25
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,102
Grab the gem! Kill the heroes!

26
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,319
Yes, kill them! Kill them! Yes!

27
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,622
Destroy everything!

28
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,959
It's the hockey team from hell.

29
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:05,379
You get the ice, I'll get the iceman.

30
00:07:24,653 --> 00:07:25,938
Ah

31
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,987
Mr. freeze: Thanks.

32
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,212
Sweet.

33
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,553
I got mine. Where's yours?

34
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,848
Mr. freeze:
What killed the dinosaurs?

35
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,429
The ice age!

36
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:56,783
Hit me, boys.

37
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,534
Thanks for playing.

38
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,309
I was hoping you'd drop in.

39
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:05,476
Mr. freeze: Oh, yes.

40
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,542
Watch the numbers.

41
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:32,203
For they are
the harbingers of your doom.

42
00:10:32,382 --> 00:10:33,542
Can you feel it coming?

43
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,799
The icy cold of space.

44
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:42,013
At 30,000 feet,
your heart will freeze...

45
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,386
And beat no more.

46
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:57,729
After you're frozen, your icy tomb
will plummet back to Gotham.

47
00:10:57,907 --> 00:10:59,317
Freeze, you're mad.

48
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:02,325
This capsule explodes,
it'll slaughter thousands.

49
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:03,617
Freeze well

50
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,681
Batman: Who invited you?
- I was hanging around.

51
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,689
I thought you'd stay in the museum,
round up some thugs.

52
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,521
How about, "nice to see you.
Thanks for saving my life."

53
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,957
- A batbomb?
- We must blow this up...

54
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,410
Before it turns Gotham into a crater.

55
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,537
Robin: Now what, call a taxi?!

56
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,046
Watch the first step!

57
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,382
Surf's up!

58
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:36,669
Robin: Gotcha!

59
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,210
Cowabunga!

60
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,197
He's freezing the furnace!

61
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,066
I got him. Batman: Robin, no!

62
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,825
Mr. freeze: Stay cool, birdboy.

63
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:10,092
Can you be cold?
You have 11 minutes to thaw the bird.

64
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:13,596
Will you chase the villain
or save the boy?

65
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:18,772
Your emotions make you weak.
That's why this day is mine.

66
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,274
I'll kill you next time!

67
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,487
Did we get him?

68
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,338
Pamela: Drats!

69
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:28,466
My experiment to mate the orchid
and the rattlesnake has failed again...

70
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:33,672
But I still have hope for
the animal-plant crossbreedings.

71
00:15:34,684 --> 00:15:37,642
If I can only find
the right dose of venom...

72
00:15:37,812 --> 00:15:41,396
These plants will be able to
fight back, like animals.

73
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,977
I will have given flora...

74
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:48,687
A chance against
the thoughtless ravages of man.

75
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,365
Personal note:

76
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,867
My work would proceed faster...

77
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:59,326
If Dr. woodrue didn't whisk
my venom samples...

78
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,708
Back to his mysterious
gilgamesh wing.

79
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,544
Why won't he let me in the lab?

80
00:16:07,717 --> 00:16:09,833
What is he doing in there?

81
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:31,438
Woodrue: Ladies and gentlemen
of the un-united nations

82
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:36,234
and our mystery bidder...

83
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,486
May I present...

84
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:41,038
Antonio Diego...

85
00:16:41,209 --> 00:16:45,578
Serial murderer,
serving life in prison...

86
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:47,746
And sole surviving...

87
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:49,004
Volunteer.

88
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,091
And what a charmer he is.

89
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:58,882
By merely drilling three
concentric holes

90
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:02,935
directly into Antonio's
cranial cavity...

91
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:07,098
I have created viaducts into
the most primitive part of his brain...

92
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,938
The limbic system.

93
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,271
And now I add.

94
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:17,074
My super-soldier serum...

95
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:19,782
Code-named "venom"

96
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:23,205
to which I add
my very own recipe of steroids...

97
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:25,116
And toxins.

98
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,540
Plug him in.

99
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,087
Time to scream.

100
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,326
Woodrue: Genius!

101
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:06,748
Behold

102
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,626
the ideal killing machine!

103
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,955
I call this little number.

104
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,626
"Bane."

105
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:16,046
Bane of humanity!

106
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,586
Imagine it.

107
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:22,549
Your own private army made up of
thousands of these super-soldiers.

108
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:26,935
Bidding begins at a mere
10 million!

109
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,520
Turbo!

110
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:30,181
Show off for daddy.

111
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,482
Dr. isley.

112
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,112
Welcome to my parlor.

113
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,697
Pamela: What?

114
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,199
You monster!

115
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,826
How could you?!

116
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:27,238
Our original sponsor had
no stomach for military applications.

117
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,991
He cut the funding for our work.
Our work?

118
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:31,750
Without your research...

119
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:34,583
I couldn't have come this far.
Join me.

120
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:39,000
- The two of us, entwined, side by side.
- Join you?

121
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:44,259
I have spent my life trying to
protect plants from extinction...

122
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:48,346
And now you corrupt my research...

123
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:52,226
Into some maniacal scheme
for world domination?

124
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:56,017
When I get through...

125
00:19:56,195 --> 00:20:00,780
You won't be able to get a job
teaching high school chemistry.

126
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,443
Do you hear me?!

127
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:05,155
You psycho!

128
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:10,456
Well, I can respect your opinion.

129
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,292
Sadly, I'm not good at rejection.

130
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,537
I'm afraid you'll have to die.

131
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:41,145
Yes yes

132
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:45,320
let the poisons and toxins
burn a grave for you...

133
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,985
Deep into the earth
you love so much!

134
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,908
Bye-bye, dear!

135
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,826
Fellow maniacs.

136
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:55,501
Bidding begins!

137
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:06,337
Bruce: Gotham university labs
security video, two years ago.

138
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:09,173
Dr. Victor fries.

139
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:13,685
Two-time olympic decathlete and
nobel prize winner for molecular biology.

140
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:17,314
After his wife contracted a rare disease,
macgregor's syndrome...

141
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:21,273
Ne hoped to freeze her in a cryogenic
sleep until he could find a cure.

142
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:24,109
Now, here's where
everything goes north.

143
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:32,325
That's got to hurt.

144
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,162
Bruce: That liquid is 50 below.

145
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:37,122
But he survived somehow.

146
00:21:38,047 --> 00:21:40,459
The cryo-solution mutated his body.

147
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,795
Dick: What happened to his wife?
- Nobody knows for sure.

148
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,463
She's presumed dead.

149
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,553
Fries needs
extreme cold to survive.

150
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:56,726
His cryo-suit uses diamond-enhanced
lasers to keep him at 0 degrees.

151
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:01,059
If it's ice the iceman wants.

152
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:05,070
Alfred.

153
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:07,823
Alfred.

154
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,911
Alfred: Coming, sir.

155
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,910
Yes, sir?

156
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:17,746
We need the Wayne diamonds.

157
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,709
We going to trap a snowman?

158
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:24,502
Absolutely, right after you spend
10 hours in the simulator, training.

159
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:28,169
I made a mistake. I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

160
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,383
You were reckless
and almost got killed.

161
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:32,890
I'm fine! See! Me, here, alive!

162
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:36,094
How we supposed to work together
if you won't trust me?

163
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,102
How indeed?

164
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:44,101
Bruce:
He's overeager, he's impulsive.

165
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,316
I can't trust him not to get hurt.

166
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:50,441
Perhaps the truth is
you really don't trust anyone.

167
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:53,945
Don't tell me
you're on his side again.

168
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:57,035
Despite all your talents...

169
00:22:57,251 --> 00:23:00,368
You're still just
a novice in the ways of family.

170
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:04,126
Master dick follows
the same star as you...

171
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:07,253
But gets there by his own course.

172
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:11,588
You must learn to trust him,
for that is the nature of family.

173
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,431
I trust you, Alfred.

174
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:18,093
But I shan't be here forever.

175
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,144
Good night, master Bruce.

176
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:26,978
Good night, Alfred.

177
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:49,424
Alfred: Oh, dear, master Bruce.

178
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:52,003
(Good gracious, what a tumble.

179
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:54,388
There's a brave boy.

180
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:08,524
Yes, sir. I am so pleased you won
the bidding, your supreme ruthlessness.

181
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,860
We're making the final modifications
on bane right now.

182
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:16,903
We'll have a flawless super-soldier
out to you tomorrow by overnight mail.

183
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,849
Woodrue: Dr. isley?

184
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,562
- Pamela?
- Mm-hm_

185
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,188
You look great.

186
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,941
Especially for a dead woman.

187
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:51,065
Hello, Jason.

188
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,906
I think I've had a change of heart.

189
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:57,818
- Or quite literally...
- Me?

190
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:02,991
The animal-plant toxins had
a rather unique effect on me.

191
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:05,830
They replaced my blood with aloe...

192
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:09,083
My skin with chlorophyll...

193
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:10,873
And filled.

194
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:13,084
My lips...

195
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,474
With venom.

196
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:28,769
Oh

197
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,984
And, Jason, one other thing.

198
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:35,489
I probably should have
mentioned this earlier

199
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:37,903
I'm...

200
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:39,780
Poison.

201
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:45,283
Whoo

202
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:48,293
it's a jungle in here.

203
00:25:49,882 --> 00:25:51,497
I am nature's arm.

204
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,045
Her spirit...

205
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:59,468
Hell, I am mother nature.

206
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,632
And the time has come.

207
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,641
For plants to take back...

208
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:06,638
The world so rightfully ours...

209
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:08,389
Because it's not nice ..

210
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:12,772
To fool with mother nature.

211
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:20,567
Hmm. "Wayne enterprises.”

212
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,040
Coming, bane, darling.

213
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,284
We've got a plane to catch.

214
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,677
I'm Mr. White Christmas

215
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,766
I'm Mr. snow

216
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:47,686
I'm mr icicle

217
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:49,851
I'm mr ten below

218
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:51,432
Mr. freeze: Sing! Sing!

219
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,068
Mr. freeze: Come on, sing!

220
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,650
I ouder! Come on!

221
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:03,694
Sing, sing, sing! Come on!

222
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,612
Men: He's mr white Christmas

223
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,369
Mr. freeze: Come on, louder!

224
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,701
Men: He's mr icicle

225
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:13,207
woman: Freezy...

226
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,372
I'm feeling hot.

227
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,590
- I find that unlikely.
- Okay.

228
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:21,716
So my hair is brittle
and my skin is dry...

229
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:24,181
I'd weather blizzards to have you.

230
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,058
You're the most perfect man
I've ever known.

231
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:29,345
What do you say we heat things up?

232
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:32,056
My passion thaws
for my bride alone.

233
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,234
Talk about your cold shoulder.

234
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,695
Frosty!

235
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,071
Yeah, boss?

236
00:27:44,246 --> 00:27:46,487
Mr. freeze: Ah. Energy.

237
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,248
Battling the bat
exhausted my power.

238
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,421
But

239
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,674
I was successful nevertheless.

240
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:02,211
Absolutely, boss.

241
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:04,922
One more giant diamond of this size...

242
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:08,176
And my freezing engine
will be complete.

243
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,687
I will freeze the city.

244
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:16,065
Then I will hold Gotham ransom.

245
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:18,644
Unless the city bows
to my demands...

246
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:20,604
It's winter forever in Gotham

247
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:23,649
the city fathers
will have no choice.

248
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:27,782
But to give me the billions
I need to complete my research...

249
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,124
So I can find a cure.

250
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:34,793
I eave us.

251
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:36,162
Sure, boss.

252
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,461
Mr. freeze:
We need quality time.

253
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,897
Soon we will be together
once more.

254
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:02,487
Soon.

255
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,841
Bruce: Alfred.

256
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,840
Dick: I'll get it.

257
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:39,684
I must've dozed off.
My sincerest apologies.

258
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:41,526
No apology necessary.

259
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:44,480
It's the first time it's happened
in 30 years.

260
00:29:57,546 --> 00:29:59,036
Please be looking for me.

261
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:02,381
Actually, I'm looking for
Alfred pennyworth.

262
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,837
Uncle Alfred.

263
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,503
Uncle Alfred!

264
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:10,055
Oh, my dear.

265
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,007
Oh, my dear...

266
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,684
What a most wonderful surprise.

267
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:17,854
How did you manage
to come here all the way from england?

268
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:21,229
My dear, you are so kind
to your old uncle.

269
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:22,813
Uncle?

270
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:29,240
Alfred: Barbara is the daughter
of my dear sister Margaret.

271
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:33,199
Barbara: Both my parents were killed
in a car accident five years ago.

272
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:35,747
Uncle Alfred's been supporting me
ever since.

273
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,703
You have? Dick: Secrets, al?

274
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,037
Secrets are a virtual prerequisite
in this house.

275
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,918
Don't you think, sir?

276
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:45,423
I'm on break from...

277
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:48,586
Oxbridge academy,
Alfred's Alma mater.

278
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,763
The new computer sciences division.

279
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:54,925
- How'd you know?
- Says so on the patch on your sweater.

280
00:30:58,357 --> 00:30:59,938
Barbara: Oh.

281
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:03,600
- What is it? It's beautiful.
- You can say that again.

282
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:05,436
It's a competition racer.

283
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:07,070
- I've been fixing it up.
- Really?

284
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:10,448
Dick: I'll show you how to ride it.
Alfred: You certainly will not!

285
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:14,237
Barbara: Don't worry, uncle Alfred.
I'm terrified of these things.

286
00:31:14,456 --> 00:31:16,617
Bruce:
Barbara, I hope you'll stay with us.

287
00:31:17,334 --> 00:31:18,790
Oh, I don't know.

288
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,123
All this luxury really isn't
my style, but...

289
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,124
Yeah, I'd love to.

290
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,131
Then it's settled.

291
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:28,796
Oh, but, sir, we...

292
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,298
We do get so busy here.

293
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:32,633
Don't be silly.

294
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:34,639
After all, she's family.

295
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,858
Barbara: Uncle Alfred?

296
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,827
I came to tuck you in.

297
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:59,330
You came to tuck me in?

298
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:01,329
That's quite a switch.

299
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:04,119
Yes. What're you working on?

300
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:07,831
I'm trying to find my brother,
your uncle wilfred.

301
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:11,968
He's first Butler
to the maharajah of miranjapore.

302
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,138
But miranjapore is a floating court.

303
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,136
It travels through India.

304
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,183
Barbara:
Oh, I remember mom getting postcards.

305
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:22,513
Alfred: So wilfred can be
rather difficult to find.

306
00:32:23,859 --> 00:32:27,022
Well, I don't suppose they have
fax machines on elephants.

307
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,317
I've been trying to reach him
with no success.

308
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,112
When one grows ancient,
one yearns for family.

309
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:40,406
I have the same picture of mom
by my bed.

310
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:41,702
Peg?

311
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:44,414
My nickname for sweet Margaret.

312
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,376
It's good to see you again.

313
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,298
I've missed you.

314
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:54,385
As I have you.

315
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:57,180
Sleep well, child.

316
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,050
You sleep.

317
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:03,887
(50 to bed.

318
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,294
Gerty: Good morning, Gotham.

319
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:15,251
It's gossip gerty reporting to you
direct from the Gotham observatory...

320
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:19,964
Where billionaire Bruce Wayne,
chairman of Wayne enterprises...

321
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:25,135
Is about to make yet another
legendary contribution to the city.

322
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,976
Gotham observatory, bane.

323
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,230
And step on it.

324
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,313
Bane: Step.

325
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:46,827
Bruce: My father told me, "to succeed,
we need only pick a star and follow it."

326
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:51,833
So Wayne enterprises is donating
the world's most advanced telescope...

327
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:55,165
To Gotham's
observatory restoration project.

328
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,674
With any luck...

329
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:59,507
This telescope will give
future generations...

330
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:02,013
A chance to follow their own stars.

331
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,349
Gerty: Brucy...

332
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:09,646
Is it true that this new telescope
can see around the globe?

333
00:35:09,858 --> 00:35:12,565
Yes. If you'll watch these monitors
right here. Doctor Lee?

334
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:18,192
Lee: Satellites in orbit allow us to
reflect light from anywhere on the planet.

335
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:22,033
From here, we'll be able
to see the sky anywhere on earth...

336
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,990
And through this
intricate network of satellites

337
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:29,540
reflect it back to our
very own Gotham city for observation.

338
00:35:29,711 --> 00:35:31,497
Just don't point it at my bedroom.

339
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:40,005
Gerty: Brucy, you
and the exquisite Julie Madison...

340
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:41,841
Have been going out forever.

341
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:44,218
Are you going to tie the knot?

342
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:45,973
Uh, marriage?

343
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:47,384
Uh, uh, marriage?

344
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:49,890
You want to give me a hand here?

345
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,559
Bruce and I are recklessly in love.

346
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:56,397
And that's most certainly
enough for us. For now.

347
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:00,901
If you will follow me,
I'll show you the central control grid.

348
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,903
You're a lot of help.

349
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:05,986
Man: Miss, you need to stop.

350
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,529
Pamela: Move, fascist bulldog!

351
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:09,914
- You need an appointment...
- No, I don't!

352
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:13,043
Man: Miss, you're not authorized
to be up here.

353
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:14,414
She has no pass, sir.

354
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:17,373
Bruce: Little overly protective,
but you won't hurt me, miss...?

355
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,131
Dr. Pamela isley.

356
00:36:19,344 --> 00:36:20,709
Doctor.

357
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,252
What can I do for you?

358
00:36:22,764 --> 00:36:24,925
Actually, I already
work for you, or did.

359
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,723
Your arboreal preservation project
in south America.

360
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:31,599
We cut our funding.
There was a conflict of ideologies.

361
00:36:31,773 --> 00:36:33,388
Dr. woodrue was a lunatic.

362
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:34,772
I see you knew him.

363
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:39,107
Yes. That lab burnt down last week.
I'm glad you escaped.

364
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,444
I have here a proposal showing how
Wayne enterprises can immediately...

365
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,618
Cease all actions
that toxify our environment.

366
00:36:46,788 --> 00:36:49,120
Forget the stars,
look here at the earth

367
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,905
our mother, our womb.

368
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:54,118
She deserves your loyalty
and protection.

369
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,911
And yet, you spoil her lands...

370
00:36:57,465 --> 00:37:00,127
Poison her oceans,
blacken her skies!

371
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,541
You're killing her!

372
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:06,262
Your intentions are noble,
but no diesel fuel for heat

373
00:37:06,433 --> 00:37:08,469
no coolants to preserve food...

374
00:37:08,685 --> 00:37:11,267
Millions of people would die
of cold and hunger.

375
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:14,186
Acceptable losses
in the battle to save the planet.

376
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:17,394
People come first, Dr. isley.

377
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,560
Mammals!

378
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,480
A day of reckoning is coming.

379
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,815
That's right.

380
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:28,611
The same plants and flowers
that saw you...

381
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,779
Crawl from the primordial soup...

382
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:35,242
Will reclaim this planet
and there will be no one to protect you!

383
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:39,162
You

384
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,456
you must be new in town.

385
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:45,134
In Gotham city,
Batman and Robin protect us...

386
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:48,008
Even from plants and flowers.

387
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,183
Maybe you'd like to meet them.

388
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,224
Caped crusaders are
going to help us auction...

389
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:59,023
A diamond to raise money
for our botanical gardens.

390
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:03,858
Just a few mammals doing what
we can for the world's plants.

391
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,655
Thank you all for coming.

392
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:07,152
(Good day, doctor.

393
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,705
Batman and Robin.

394
00:38:19,214 --> 00:38:22,672
Militant arm
of the warm-blooded oppressors...

395
00:38:23,468 --> 00:38:27,131
Animal protectors of the status quo.

396
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:29,679
First

397
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:33,554
I'll rid myself of the fur
and feathered pests.

398
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,845
And then Gotham.

399
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,521
Will be mine.

400
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,473
For the greening.

401
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,080
Uh, excuse me, chief.

402
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,836
I got something here
you might want to see.

403
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:15,513
I hate when people talk
during the movie.

404
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:37,117
One more diamond, my love.

405
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:39,787
One more.

406
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:49,376
"Bruce Wayne. Diamonds." Hmm.

407
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,387
Very nice.

408
00:40:38,019 --> 00:40:40,761
Announcer:
Ladies and gentlemen...

409
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:44,682
Gossip gerty
of good morning Gotham and I...

410
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:49,106
Welcome you to
the gem of the evening.

411
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:52,405
Gerty:
Our own commissioner Gordon

412
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:57,903
displaying the famed heart of Isis,
on loan.

413
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:02,536
From the collection of my
close personal friend, Bruce Wayne.

414
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,713
- Think freeze will take the bait?
- He'll be here.

415
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:12,713
To dance with one
of our fabulous flowers

416
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:16,555
the famed diamond
draped around her neck.

417
00:41:19,227 --> 00:41:21,889
Gerty: Let's start the bidding!

418
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:24,888
I'll give 10,000 for the orchid!

419
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:29,309
Man: 20,000 for the tiger Lily!

420
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:32,521
And I bid

421
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:36,483
30,000 dollars
for the lovely magnolia!

422
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,581
Gerty: Boys, please...

423
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,663
Let's show some gusto!

424
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:54,128
Hi there.

425
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:57,043
And you are?

426
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,174
Poison

427
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:00,797
poison lvy.

428
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:10,019
Poison Ivy: Mmm.

429
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:14,224
Why not send junior home early?

430
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,852
I've got some wild oats to sow.

431
00:44:19,574 --> 00:44:21,405
On the other hand

432
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:25,409
youth does have its advantages.

433
00:44:26,247 --> 00:44:28,738
Endurance, stamina.

434
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:31,749
Forget the geriatric bat.

435
00:44:32,128 --> 00:44:33,664
Come, join me.

436
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:36,124
My garden needs tending.

437
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:38,088
I'll take it from here, pal.

438
00:44:38,259 --> 00:44:40,420
Wouldn't you like the earrings too?

439
00:44:41,262 --> 00:44:45,426
Poison Ivy: Some lucky boy's
about to hit the honey pot.

440
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:49,850
I'll include an evening of my company
for the winner.

441
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:52,932
I'll bring everything you see here...

442
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:56,524
Plus everything you don't.

443
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:01,274
I bid 50,000 dollars for poison Ivy!

444
00:45:04,202 --> 00:45:06,284
100,000!

445
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:08,778
And I'll bid

446
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:12,282
500,000 dollars!

447
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,288
One million dollars.

448
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:19,130
Two million.
You don't have it. Three million.

449
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,790
I'll borrow it from you. Four.

450
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:24,756
- Five million.
- That's a utility belt, not a money belt.

451
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:27,054
- Six million.
- Seven million.

452
00:45:30,603 --> 00:45:31,934
Never leave the cave without it.

453
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:35,809
You boys aren't going to start
fighting over little me, now, are you?

454
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,787
All right, everyone! Chill.

455
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,616
Chill. Chill

456
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:05,005
Get the gun!

457
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,786
Yeah

458
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:42,542
Boo.

459
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:49,883
Mr. freeze: Look at youl!

460
00:46:50,141 --> 00:46:52,006
Let me guess.

461
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:53,883
Plant girl?

462
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:56,052
Vine lady?

463
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:59,055
Hand over the diamond, garden gal...

464
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:01,061
Or I'll turn you into mulch.

465
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:07,529
Pheromone dust

466
00:47:08,576 --> 00:47:11,409
designed to heat a man's blood.

467
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,195
Doesn't work on the cold-hearted.
If you please!

468
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,331
If you insist.

469
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,329
Clever little clover.

470
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:24,914
Man: Whoa!

471
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:29,589
That's my exit cue.

472
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:31,379
Thanks.

473
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:44,058
Good night.

474
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,607
Cool party!

475
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:18,264
Commissioner, you have 11 minutes
to thaw these people.

476
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:28,732
Miss Ivy, you've just met
one of the most sinister men in Gotham.

477
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:31,147
That's not a man.

478
00:48:31,367 --> 00:48:33,358
That is a god.

479
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,411
Enough monkey business.

480
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:44,494
We've got work to do.

481
00:48:45,381 --> 00:48:46,917
Bane: Monkey work.

482
00:49:37,725 --> 00:49:40,341
- Pull back. You can't make the jump.
- I can make it!

483
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:45,433
- Pull back!
- I can make it!

484
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,139
Redbird control codes

485
00:49:50,196 --> 00:49:51,436
disable engine.

486
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:54,571
Robin: No! Don't do this to me!

487
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,361
No!

488
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,073
We won't make it!

489
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:29,269
It's a cold town.

490
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,530
Uh-oh

491
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:02,298
Robin:
I could've made that jump.

492
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:05,388
You could've splattered your brains
on the building's side.

493
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:07,224
The flying graysons were a team.

494
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,472
We had to trust each person
to do his job.

495
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:11,641
That's what being partners is about.

496
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:14,276
Counting on someone
is the way to win.

497
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:16,732
Your head wasn't on the job.
It was on poison Ivy.

498
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,565
Maybe she wanted me instead of you.

499
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,449
That's your idea of friendship?

500
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:24,278
It's your rules.
It's your way, or the highway.

501
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:27,114
It's Batman and Robin,
not Robin and Batman.

502
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:30,497
- I'm sick of it!
- Yes, it's my rules that keep us alive.

503
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:34,038
If you want to stay in this house,
on this team, you'll abide by them.

504
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:36,790
This is no partnership.

505
00:51:37,011 --> 00:51:38,842
You're never going to trust me!

506
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:47,183
Alfred: Dear brother wilfred

507
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:51,681
I have tried
every address I know for you.

508
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:54,191
I'm just praying this reaches you.

509
00:51:55,029 --> 00:51:56,610
We have very little time.

510
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:15,625
Alfred:
Batman monopolized the evening news.

511
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:17,710
Bruce: Huh yes.

512
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:20,467
Congratulations on your
apprehension of Mr. freeze.

513
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,215
Bruce: Thanks. Thank you.

514
00:52:25,726 --> 00:52:27,341
Is there something wrong, sir?

515
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:29,851
Alfred.

516
00:52:30,606 --> 00:52:32,187
Am I pig-headed?

517
00:52:32,358 --> 00:52:34,064
Is it 7

518
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:36,392
is it always...

519
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:38,603
My way or the highway?

520
00:52:38,906 --> 00:52:40,737
Why, yes. Actually.

521
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:45,652
Death and chance stole your parents...

522
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:47,904
But rather than become a victim.

523
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:52,078
You have done everything
in your power to control the fates.

524
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:54,744
For what is Batman...

525
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:59,669
If not an effort to master the chaos
that sweeps our world?

526
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:02,422
An attempt to control...

527
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,261
Death itself?

528
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,941
But I can't, can I?

529
00:53:27,538 --> 00:53:29,199
None of us can.

530
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:50,928
Dick: Hey!

531
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:52,976
Barbara: Hyah!

532
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,393
Sorry. Um, so sorry!

533
00:53:57,568 --> 00:53:59,183
Dick:
Teach you that at oxbridge?

534
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:03,692
Just a few judo lessons.
You know, London's kind of rough.

535
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,440
I suppose you had
a minor in motorbikes also?

536
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,493
Couldn't resist

537
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:11,988
it's just so beautiful.

538
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,825
I just took it out for a spin.
I'l clean it tomorrow.

539
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:18,585
All right? Sorry.

540
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:21,121
Um, sorry. Good night.

541
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:08,760
Man 1:
Drag him into the cold beam.

542
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:12,506
Welcome home, frost face.

543
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:15,763
You're the common cold,
and we are the cure.

544
00:55:18,065 --> 00:55:20,556
Allow me to break the ice.

545
00:55:20,901 --> 00:55:23,062
My name is freeze.

546
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,060
I earn it well

547
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:28,155
for it's the chilling sound
of your doom.

548
00:55:40,087 --> 00:55:44,205
Man 1: All right, freezie, you
can't live outside the cold zone.

549
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:57,844
Man 1: I ook at him stew.

550
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:01,601
Man 2: Get used to it.

551
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:06,360
You're going to be here a very long,
long time.

552
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,317
Sadly...

553
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:11,945
You will not live to see it.

554
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,082
Oh, yes.

555
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:27,381
Batface and birdbrain turned out
to be much more

556
00:56:27,593 --> 00:56:29,959
resistant to my love dust
than expected.

557
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:34,130
No matter. Next time
I'll just give them a stronger dose.

558
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:37,428
They'll literally be dying for me.

559
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:40,602
Hmm "turkish baths"

560
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:42,725
this looks promising.

561
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:09,915
Poison Ivy: Hmm.

562
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:11,924
A fixer-upper.

563
00:57:12,512 --> 00:57:14,594
But with a certain homey charm.

564
00:57:15,307 --> 00:57:17,514
Ah a minus!

565
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:19,682
Current tenants.

566
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:22,807
Hello, my little pretty, pretty, pretty.

567
00:57:23,023 --> 00:57:24,684
Hello yourself.

568
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,936
You look good enough to eat.

569
00:57:27,653 --> 00:57:29,484
That I am.

570
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:32,897
Come and get me, if you can.

571
00:57:35,661 --> 00:57:37,322
With pleasure.

572
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:59,214
I et's redecorate.

573
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:11,693
I've always hankered
for something on the water.

574
00:58:20,247 --> 00:58:22,238
What is this floor?

575
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:31,667
It took god seven days...

576
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:33,958
To create paradise.

577
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:37,176
I et's see if I can do better.

578
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:45,093
(Ood babies.

579
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:47,183
Grow for mommy.

580
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,606
Bane, darling...

581
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:58,278
I found a fellow
who strikes my fancy.

582
00:58:58,493 --> 00:59:00,609
A cool customer, yes.

583
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:03,616
Icy demeanor...

584
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,697
No question.

585
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:10,286
But I detect a certain ruthless charm
I may be able to use...

586
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:12,370
To my advantage.

587
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,791
Honey, clean up this mess.

588
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:18,135
We've got company coming.

589
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:20,136
Bane: Honey.

590
00:59:20,307 --> 00:59:21,592
Company.

591
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:32,644
Julie: Bruce... hmm?

592
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:38,530
We've been going out
for over a year now, and...

593
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:41,157
Okay, here it goes.

594
00:59:41,328 --> 00:59:43,569
I want to spend my life with you.

595
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,664
I'm not the marrying kind.

596
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:51,668
There are things about me
you wouldn't understand.

597
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:55,081
I know you're a dedicated bachelor.

598
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,665
You've had your wild nights.

599
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:58,917
"Wild" doesn't

600
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:01,253
doesn't quite cover it.

601
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:05,340
You'll make someone
a good husband one day...

602
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:08,176
But I can't wait forever.

603
01:00:12,192 --> 01:00:15,025
Look, I don't want to pressure you.
Because if I do

604
01:00:15,195 --> 01:00:17,277
you'll just shut down.

605
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:19,278
I know the way you are.

606
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:22,607
Think about it.

607
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:25,076
Just promise me you'll think about it.

608
01:00:25,956 --> 01:00:27,366
Okay?

609
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:30,115
You don't have to answer now.

610
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,076
Just think it over.

611
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:35,127
Here's some food for thought.

612
01:00:53,984 --> 01:00:55,224
Julie: Who's Ivy?

613
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:59,360
Bruce: What?
- You just called me "lvy."

614
01:00:59,573 --> 01:01:00,858
Who's vy?

615
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:03,490
I wish I knew.

616
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:08,115
Dick: Enhance detail, 14 to 19.

617
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:14,997
Who are you?

618
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:30,345
(Gotchal

619
01:02:18,193 --> 01:02:19,808
Banker, how much coin to play?

620
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:21,101
Two and a half.

621
01:02:21,321 --> 01:02:24,233
You're the chick who won
the tunnel run two nights ago!

622
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:25,487
That'd be me.

623
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:28,112
That was kid stuff, sweetheart.

624
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:31,119
Why don't you take your tricycle
and run home?

625
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:33,780
- Want a side bet?
- How much?

626
01:02:33,959 --> 01:02:35,824
- How much you got?
- How much you got?

627
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:39,290
All right, let's race! Come on!

628
01:02:47,222 --> 01:02:50,510
Spike: Just make sure the guys
are ready at the end of the bridge.

629
01:02:51,685 --> 01:02:53,016
You got it, spike!

630
01:03:39,399 --> 01:03:40,809
Go, go, go!

631
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:43,062
Watch your left!

632
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:04,287
Spike: Out of my way, losers!

633
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:08,299
Nice try, girlie! You're next!

634
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:11,757
Fxcuse Mel

635
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:16,929
look out, baby!

636
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:37,946
Not bad for a chick!

637
01:05:11,491 --> 01:05:12,981
Now!

638
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:28,417
End of the line, sweetheart!

639
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:56,449
So this is where you hang out.

640
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:02,288
Dick: How long you been racing?

641
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,536
Barbara: Since my parents died.

642
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:08,704
I guess all the speed and danger
helped take me out of myself.

643
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:10,663
Made the pain go away.

644
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:12,832
You wouldn't understand.

645
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:14,542
Dick: You'd be surprised.

646
01:06:14,929 --> 01:06:19,548
Barbara: Street racing isn't exactly
an acceptable major at oxbridge...

647
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:21,182
So they kicked me out.

648
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:25,062
But I've already won the money I need
to do what I've always dreamed.

649
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:27,306
Don't say you want to join the circus.

650
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:32,519
Alfred has supported me my whole life
and I'm going to pay him back.

651
01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:36,026
I'll take him away
from this dismal life of servitude.

652
01:06:36,868 --> 01:06:38,358
What are you talking about?

653
01:06:38,578 --> 01:06:41,320
Listen, this whole
master-servant thing...

654
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:42,904
It's really ridiculous.

655
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:45,414
Alfred is a sweet, noble man...

656
01:06:45,585 --> 01:06:49,077
And he's subjugated all his life
and dreams to someone else.

657
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:51,246
Dick:
Alfred and Bruce are like family.

658
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:54,590
Paying someone
to prepare your meals...

659
01:06:54,761 --> 01:06:57,673
Do laundry, clean dishes,
you call that family?

660
01:06:57,889 --> 01:06:59,254
Dick: Alfred's happy.

661
01:06:59,599 --> 01:07:00,964
Happy?

662
01:07:01,601 --> 01:07:04,013
You honestly don't know, do you?

663
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:06,724
How he's hiding the pain all the time.

664
01:07:07,482 --> 01:07:08,767
Alfred's sick.

665
01:07:12,362 --> 01:07:14,273
Bruce: Alfred's not sick.

666
01:07:14,614 --> 01:07:15,979
He's dying.

667
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,111
Dying?

668
01:07:23,248 --> 01:07:24,784
Why didn't he tell us?

669
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:27,957
You know Alfred,
he'd never say anything.

670
01:07:34,259 --> 01:07:35,624
But I can tell

671
01:07:40,598 --> 01:07:42,304
I can't believe it.

672
01:07:43,810 --> 01:07:45,095
I know.

673
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:32,601
Man 1: Cellblock

674
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:35,190
lcehead, you got a visitor.

675
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:38,186
Your sister is here to see you.

676
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:39,649
Sister?

677
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:45,697
Brother, dear...

678
01:08:46,331 --> 01:08:48,447
I heard you were blue.

679
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:55,370
You can speak freely.

680
01:08:58,092 --> 01:09:00,583
I don't mind you at all.

681
01:09:04,515 --> 01:09:05,846
Men

682
01:09:06,017 --> 01:09:08,633
the most absurd of god's creatures.

683
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:10,392
We give you life...

684
01:09:11,105 --> 01:09:14,472
And we can take it away
just as easily.

685
01:09:14,651 --> 01:09:16,892
Man 1: Right! Man 2: Whatever.

686
01:09:18,237 --> 01:09:20,853
I really am to die for.

687
01:09:48,726 --> 01:09:50,262
Impressive!

688
01:09:51,396 --> 01:09:54,729
Well, I, my most
unabominable showman.

689
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:57,686
Have been impressed by you.

690
01:09:57,902 --> 01:09:59,267
In fact

691
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:01,902
I propose a pairing.

692
01:10:02,073 --> 01:10:03,404
Hmm.

693
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:14,032
I've come to set you free.

694
01:10:15,086 --> 01:10:16,951
An enticing offer...

695
01:10:17,588 --> 01:10:20,921
Out what does the lady
want in return?

696
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:27,170
Let's cool it for now.
I've got someone I want you to meet.

697
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:36,937
His name is bane.

698
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:40,941
A laundry service that delivers! Wow!

699
01:10:45,616 --> 01:10:48,779
What are you,
about a 50, big and tall?

700
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:52,445
No, I always go a size smaller.
Makes me look slimmer.

701
01:10:58,337 --> 01:10:59,918
I'm running on empty.

702
01:11:00,131 --> 01:11:01,667
I need the diamonds.

703
01:11:01,841 --> 01:11:03,957
I'll help you grab your rocks.

704
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:09,837
Bane, dear...

705
01:11:10,016 --> 01:11:11,722
An exit, please.

706
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:19,104
Reinforced steel.

707
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:20,606
Not good.

708
01:11:31,496 --> 01:11:34,784
Mr. freeze:
Always winterize your pipes.

709
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:53,973
While I get my diamonds,
you and meatloaf retrieve my wife.

710
01:11:54,185 --> 01:11:57,302
- You never mentioned a wife!
- Come on.

711
01:11:57,522 --> 01:11:59,387
I hope Mr. bane can swim.

712
01:12:17,917 --> 01:12:19,908
Bruce: Alfred, are you well?

713
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:22,744
As well as can be expected, sir.

714
01:12:24,924 --> 01:12:26,414
My friend, I know you're sick.

715
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:28,423
I can get you the best doctors.

716
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:31,301
I have seen the best doctors.

717
01:12:31,806 --> 01:12:36,425
A gentleman does not discuss
his ailments. It is not civilized

718
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:41,100
I hope that I have taught you
at least that much, master Bruce.

719
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:43,056
Alfred.

720
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:45,933
Nave you ever...

721
01:12:46,112 --> 01:12:48,603
Regretted your life working here?

722
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:50,904
Looking after heroes?

723
01:12:51,117 --> 01:12:52,357
No, sir.

724
01:12:53,327 --> 01:12:57,616
My only regret is that I was never
able to be out there with you.

725
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,326
Not all the heroes wear masks.

726
01:13:07,592 --> 01:13:08,877
Freeze has escaped!

727
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:25,139
We got this off
the arkham surveillance camera.

728
01:13:28,487 --> 01:13:29,772
Robin: Poison Ivy.

729
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:32,487
Two nights ago...

730
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:36,742
Gotham airport, these two arrive
by charter from south America.

731
01:13:37,163 --> 01:13:40,121
They put 10 security guards
in the hospital...

732
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:44,827
Left a businessman dead from
organic poisoning, stole his limousine.

733
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:48,329
This is definitely the same pair
that sprang freeze.

734
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:50,998
Man: Commissioner Gordon.
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

735
01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:54,340
Poison lvy, why would
she help freeze escape?

736
01:13:54,513 --> 01:13:56,128
She's definitely evil.

737
01:13:56,349 --> 01:13:59,136
She was all I could think about,
like I was in love, but...

738
01:13:59,352 --> 01:14:01,468
I know, then the feeling vanished.

739
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:06,522
Bad, yes. Guy, no.

740
01:14:06,692 --> 01:14:08,478
Well, I'm totally over her.

741
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:10,400
Me too. Definitely.

742
01:14:11,364 --> 01:14:13,355
- Great stems, though.
- Buds too.

743
01:14:13,532 --> 01:14:16,023
Yeah, those are nice. Here we go.

744
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:23,368
Robin: It's Nora fries.

745
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:24,907
Batman: She's still alive.

746
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:43,726
He adapted his freezing technology
to reverse the disease.

747
01:14:43,938 --> 01:14:46,475
He even found a cure for the disease
in some stages.

748
01:14:47,525 --> 01:14:48,560
There she is.

749
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:52,226
Poison Ivy: Get the diamonds.
I'll rescue your bride.

750
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:54,232
We'll meet back at my place.

751
01:14:54,407 --> 01:14:58,741
No. In my weakened condition,
I'm no match for the bat and bird.

752
01:14:58,953 --> 01:15:01,444
You leave those boys to me.

753
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:03,324
(Gol

754
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:08,201
Robin: Can he save her?
- Her case is too advanced

755
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:09,752
but maybe someday...

756
01:15:09,964 --> 01:15:11,579
With more research.

757
01:15:18,097 --> 01:15:19,428
Robin: Poison Ivy.

758
01:15:29,567 --> 01:15:31,683
I hate uninvited guests.

759
01:15:36,574 --> 01:15:37,859
Man: My lungs!

760
01:15:38,909 --> 01:15:40,490
My lungs are freezing!

761
01:15:53,424 --> 01:15:55,710
Chilled to perfection.

762
01:16:03,017 --> 01:16:04,052
No beauty.

763
01:16:06,979 --> 01:16:08,515
Just the beast.

764
01:16:28,501 --> 01:16:30,537
Hey, there, pretty birdie.

765
01:16:30,753 --> 01:16:32,664
Give yourself up. If you surrender...

766
01:16:32,838 --> 01:16:34,248
To you?

767
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:38,006
Polly want a kiss?

768
01:16:50,356 --> 01:16:54,690
There's something about
an anatomically correct...

769
01:16:54,944 --> 01:16:59,028
Rubber suit
that puts fire in a girl's lips.

770
01:17:02,368 --> 01:17:05,826
Why are all the gorgeous ones
homicidal maniacs? Is it me?

771
01:17:05,996 --> 01:17:08,783
Enough sweet talk.

772
01:17:08,999 --> 01:17:10,364
Batman: Oh, no.

773
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:15,043
First you'll tell me where freeze is,
then you're going to jail.

774
01:17:19,385 --> 01:17:20,841
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

775
01:17:21,053 --> 01:17:24,386
That's why every poison lvy
action figure comes with him!

776
01:17:27,893 --> 01:17:30,726
Try not to make a mess when you die.

777
01:17:59,717 --> 01:18:01,082
Mr. freeze: Yes, yes.

778
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:02,920
Man: Hold it right there!

779
01:18:24,617 --> 01:18:25,948
Stop!

780
01:18:28,287 --> 01:18:31,905
Living in the shadow
of the big, bad bat.

781
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:33,955
You don't need him.

782
01:18:34,793 --> 01:18:36,909
You're the star.

783
01:18:37,129 --> 01:18:38,915
I can see it now:

784
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:43,295
Your own big, bright signal in the sky.

785
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:46,127
Let me guide you.

786
01:18:54,813 --> 01:18:56,644
Let me kiss you.

787
01:18:56,815 --> 01:18:58,305
Batman: Stop! Don't kiss her.

788
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:01,817
The victim at the airport,
toxins introduced orally.

789
01:19:01,987 --> 01:19:04,649
- What are you saying?
- Why does she want to kiss us?

790
01:19:04,823 --> 01:19:07,280
- I bet her lips are poisoned.
- Poisoned kiss?

791
01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:08,824
You have issues with women!

792
01:19:08,994 --> 01:19:11,485
You can't stand that
she'd kiss me and not you.

793
01:19:11,705 --> 01:19:13,787
Something would be mine, not yours.

794
01:19:24,343 --> 01:19:25,423
Poison Ivy: Exit, bane.

795
01:19:25,803 --> 01:19:27,339
Bane: Exit!

796
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:40,852
Ivy's right. I don't need your help.

797
01:19:43,195 --> 01:19:44,856
I'm going solo!

798
01:19:47,533 --> 01:19:50,445
What happened?
How'd they get away?

799
01:20:07,886 --> 01:20:10,878
Poison Ivy:
I've never been good with competition.

800
01:20:12,891 --> 01:20:16,054
Who needs a frigid wife anyway?

801
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:42,917
Make yourself right at home.

802
01:20:45,215 --> 01:20:46,580
Where's my wife?

803
01:20:47,051 --> 01:20:50,088
There was nothing I could do.
Batman deactivated her.

804
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:52,712
She's dead. You lie!

805
01:20:57,436 --> 01:20:59,222
Oh, no.

806
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:19,113
I'm sorry.

807
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:24,372
Their bones will turn to ice!

808
01:21:26,465 --> 01:21:29,127
Their blood will freeze in my hands!

809
01:21:29,968 --> 01:21:31,424
Kill them, of course.

810
01:21:31,637 --> 01:21:33,468
But why stop there?

811
01:21:34,139 --> 01:21:36,926
Why should only
Batman and Robin die

812
01:21:37,142 --> 01:21:40,555
while the society that created them
goes unpunished?

813
01:21:40,771 --> 01:21:42,477
Yes!

814
01:21:42,648 --> 01:21:44,809
If I must suffer.

815
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:47,941
Humanity will suffer with me!

816
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:52,988
I shall repay them for sentencing me
to a life without human comfort.

817
01:21:53,659 --> 01:21:56,992
I will blanket the city
in endless winter!

818
01:21:57,371 --> 01:21:58,486
First

819
01:21:59,998 --> 01:22:01,158
Gotham.

820
01:22:02,334 --> 01:22:03,870
And then

821
01:22:04,128 --> 01:22:05,459
the world!

822
01:22:05,879 --> 01:22:08,666
Just what I had in mind.

823
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:13,125
Everything dead on earth except us.

824
01:22:13,345 --> 01:22:14,835
A chance for.

825
01:22:15,013 --> 01:22:17,880
Mother nature to start again.

826
01:22:18,183 --> 01:22:22,017
Behold, the dawn of a new age.

827
01:22:25,524 --> 01:22:28,687
My mutant plants have the strength
of the deadliest animals.

828
01:22:29,528 --> 01:22:33,897
Once you have frozen mankind,
these babies will overrun the globe.

829
01:22:34,908 --> 01:22:36,694
And we shall rule them.

830
01:22:38,412 --> 01:22:39,868
For we will be

831
01:22:40,038 --> 01:22:42,700
the only two people
left in the world.

832
01:22:43,542 --> 01:22:45,203
Yes

833
01:22:45,544 --> 01:22:47,205
Adam.

834
01:22:48,046 --> 01:22:49,536
And evil.

835
01:22:49,715 --> 01:22:51,205
Yes

836
01:22:51,383 --> 01:22:53,339
Mr. freeze:
You distract the bat and bird

837
01:22:53,552 --> 01:22:55,042
while I prepare...

838
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:56,630
To freeze

839
01:22:56,889 --> 01:22:58,254
Gotham!

840
01:23:12,779 --> 01:23:15,896
It's stage one
of macgregor's syndrome.

841
01:23:16,492 --> 01:23:17,902
I'm sorry.

842
01:23:18,744 --> 01:23:21,577
All we can do is
make him comfortable

843
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:25,413
dick: Thank you, doctor.

844
01:23:42,768 --> 01:23:45,601
Dick: Macgregor's syndrome is
what fries' wife had.

845
01:23:45,771 --> 01:23:48,638
Bruce: Alfred's condition is
less severe fries' research said

846
01:23:48,815 --> 01:23:51,147
nhe cured a case like it,
just didn't say how.

847
01:23:51,318 --> 01:23:53,229
Dick: No one else is even close.

848
01:23:53,445 --> 01:23:57,063
I'm late for the dedication,
then I go after freeze and Ivy alone.

849
01:23:57,282 --> 01:23:59,568
- Like hell you do.
- Don't push me right now.

850
01:23:59,785 --> 01:24:02,993
Or what”? No one can
capture Ivy but the big, bad bat?

851
01:24:03,163 --> 01:24:05,950
Yeah, right.
You want her for yourself, don't you?

852
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:09,829
I want her so badly, I can taste it.
That's the whole point.

853
01:24:10,671 --> 01:24:15,131
She's done something to us.
She has us fighting over her somehow.

854
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:18,667
I know she loves me and not you,
and it's driving you crazy.

855
01:24:18,845 --> 01:24:21,302
That's why you
stopped us from kissing.

856
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:25,011
You're not thinking straight.
But I am.

857
01:24:25,185 --> 01:24:27,141
For the first time in a long time.

858
01:24:27,354 --> 01:24:29,845
I want a Robin signal
in the sky, all right?

859
01:24:30,065 --> 01:24:32,021
I'm tired of living in your shadow.

860
01:24:32,192 --> 01:24:33,477
All that ends now.

861
01:24:38,574 --> 01:24:40,314
I'm sorry, uncle.

862
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:43,321
I was too late.

863
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:50,366
You must

864
01:24:54,214 --> 01:24:56,830
you must do something for me.

865
01:24:59,011 --> 01:25:00,967
Find my brother, wilfred...

866
01:25:01,179 --> 01:25:04,967
Your uncle, wherever he is
and give him this.

867
01:25:05,183 --> 01:25:08,892
I have duties
that he must fulfill in my stead.

868
01:25:10,355 --> 01:25:12,846
Only family can be trusted.

869
01:25:13,734 --> 01:25:15,224
What is it?

870
01:25:15,402 --> 01:25:18,860
It is a sacred trust of two good men...

871
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:22,197
Whom I have the honor
of calling "sir."

872
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:28,203
Take it to wilfred,
and I implore you...

873
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:30,660
Never open it.

874
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:37,337
You look so like your mother.

875
01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:43,385
Gerty:
Bonsoir, glamorous gothamites.

876
01:25:43,639 --> 01:25:45,550
Everyone who's anyone...

877
01:25:45,724 --> 01:25:47,430
Has flocked to the observatory...

878
01:25:47,643 --> 01:25:51,761
And tonight's star-studded
dedication of the new telescope.

879
01:25:56,652 --> 01:26:00,065
And here's the man
of the hour himself

880
01:26:00,280 --> 01:26:02,271
Bruce Wayne.

881
01:26:02,908 --> 01:26:05,115
Man 1:
Mr. Wayne, how about a statement?

882
01:26:05,285 --> 01:26:06,525
Bruce: Excuse me.

883
01:26:06,703 --> 01:26:08,864
Man 2: Over here, Mr. Wayne.
Man 3: Bruce! Bruce!

884
01:26:09,456 --> 01:26:10,536
Bruce: Commissioner.

885
01:26:10,707 --> 01:26:12,243
Gordon: How are you?
Bruce: Good.

886
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:15,159
- How are you?
- How are you? Good to see you, Bruce.

887
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:18,874
Young man.

888
01:26:19,424 --> 01:26:22,166
Hello, gerty. Lovely to see you again.

889
01:26:27,557 --> 01:26:28,922
Gordon: Thank you.

890
01:26:29,267 --> 01:26:32,100
Pamela: Commissioner Gordon.
Yes?

891
01:26:33,438 --> 01:26:35,099
I've always wondered...

892
01:26:35,315 --> 01:26:39,103
Where does
that big old batlight come from?

893
01:26:44,991 --> 01:26:47,403
Why, it's...

894
01:26:47,619 --> 01:26:49,780
On top of police headquarters.

895
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:53,743
I'd just love to see it.

896
01:26:53,959 --> 01:26:56,416
But you probably don't have access.

897
01:26:56,628 --> 01:26:57,834
Why, dear lady...

898
01:26:58,964 --> 01:27:01,296
I am the police commissioner.

899
01:27:01,508 --> 01:27:04,466
I have the keys
right here in my pocket.

900
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,210
Would you like to see it?

901
01:27:24,823 --> 01:27:27,815
Who are you, dear lady?

902
01:27:30,662 --> 01:27:33,495
On second thought,
you're way too old for me.

903
01:27:33,749 --> 01:27:35,364
No, I'm not.

904
01:27:36,543 --> 01:27:37,999
Please

905
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:39,868
come back.

906
01:27:46,553 --> 01:27:48,669
What are you doing”? Come on.

907
01:27:49,389 --> 01:27:51,846
- Show me how the satellites work.
- Okay.

908
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:09,649
First, I will turn Gotham into
an icy graveyard...

909
01:28:09,868 --> 01:28:13,861
Then I will pull Batman's heart
from his body...

910
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:17,072
And feel it freeze in my hands.

911
01:28:21,171 --> 01:28:22,206
Revenge!

912
01:28:23,715 --> 01:28:25,205
Poison Ivy: Quickly, bane.

913
01:28:25,425 --> 01:28:26,881
Quickly, now.

914
01:28:40,106 --> 01:28:42,222
Let there be light.

915
01:28:48,573 --> 01:28:50,939
Barbara:
Only family can be trusted?

916
01:28:51,326 --> 01:28:53,317
Well

917
01:28:53,912 --> 01:28:55,072
I'm family.

920
01:29:21,273 --> 01:29:22,763
Hey.

921
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:34,866
I spend my entire life
trying to beat back death.

922
01:29:39,124 --> 01:29:41,490
Everything I've done,
everything I'm...

923
01:29:42,168 --> 01:29:44,159
Capable of doing...

924
01:29:47,674 --> 01:29:49,665
But I can't save you.

925
01:29:50,886 --> 01:29:53,969
There's no defeat in death

926
01:29:54,139 --> 01:29:56,130
master Bruce.

927
01:29:57,517 --> 01:30:00,475
Victory comes in defending...

928
01:30:00,687 --> 01:30:02,973
What we know is right...

929
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:05,889
While we still live.

930
01:30:35,055 --> 01:30:36,841
I love you, old man.

931
01:30:40,185 --> 01:30:43,018
And I love you too.

935
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:20,175
Barbara: Margaret.

936
01:31:21,267 --> 01:31:22,677
Margaret.

937

938
01:31:36,908 --> 01:31:38,273

Computer: Access allowed.

940
01:32:13,319 --> 01:32:16,561
Mr. freeze: The combined power of
the telescope's reflecting crystals...

941
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:19,648
Will complete my freezing engine.

942
01:32:20,076 --> 01:32:21,282
Yes

943
01:32:23,413 --> 01:32:26,246
no matter what they tell you,
mr bane.

944
01:32:26,458 --> 01:32:29,120
It is the size of
your gun that counts.

945
01:32:29,294 --> 01:32:30,830
Bane: Gun.

946
01:32:38,803 --> 01:32:39,963
Bruce: Where are you going?

947
01:32:40,138 --> 01:32:42,971
It's not a batlight, it's a Robin signal.
Ivy's calling me.

948
01:32:43,183 --> 01:32:45,970
She is Pamela isley.
She must've stolen Gordon's keys.

949
01:32:46,144 --> 01:32:48,977
- She changed the signal.
- She did it for me, for love.

950
01:32:49,147 --> 01:32:50,978
She infected us with pheromones.

951
01:32:51,191 --> 01:32:53,477
I'm under some kind of magic spell?

952
01:32:53,693 --> 01:32:54,853
She wants to kill you.

953
01:32:55,195 --> 01:32:57,686
You'd say anything to keep her
away from me.

954
01:32:57,947 --> 01:32:59,483
To keep her for yourself.

955
01:32:59,991 --> 01:33:02,653
You said being a team
means trusting your partner.

956
01:33:02,869 --> 01:33:07,363
Sometimes counting on someone
else is the only way to win. Remember?

957
01:33:07,999 --> 01:33:11,708
You weren't talking about partners,
but about being a family.

958
01:33:12,378 --> 01:33:13,993
So I'm asking you...

959
01:33:14,172 --> 01:33:17,005
Friend, partner, brother...

960
01:33:17,884 --> 01:33:20,500
Will you trust me now?

961
01:33:32,232 --> 01:33:34,894
Woman: All the crystals are in place.
Lee: Thank you.

962
01:33:44,410 --> 01:33:45,695
Hil

963
01:33:45,870 --> 01:33:47,701
oh. I'm sorry about the door.

964
01:33:48,665 --> 01:33:49,871
Is the party over?

965
01:33:50,125 --> 01:33:51,706
Bane: Over.

966
01:33:53,002 --> 01:33:54,867
Who is this nutball?

967
01:34:13,231 --> 01:34:15,347
Bane: Bomb.

968
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:19,271
Bomb.

969
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:26,445
Bomb.

970
01:34:30,290 --> 01:34:31,575
Bomb.

971
01:34:34,419 --> 01:34:36,080
If revenge...

972
01:34:36,296 --> 01:34:38,662
1s a dish best served cold

973
01:34:39,174 --> 01:34:41,665
then put on your Sunday finest.

974
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:45,377
It's time to feast!

975
01:34:56,941 --> 01:34:58,147
Tonight...

976
01:34:58,318 --> 01:35:01,606
Hell freezes over.

977
01:35:39,984 --> 01:35:42,020
Alfred. Intruder alert

978
01:35:42,278 --> 01:35:43,484
intruder alert.

979
01:35:45,740 --> 01:35:47,947
Intruder alert. Identify.

980
01:35:48,785 --> 01:35:51,242
Uncle Alfred, it's me. Barbara.

981
01:35:51,663 --> 01:35:54,655
I expected you might find
your way down here, child.

982
01:35:54,832 --> 01:35:57,289
I programmed my brain algorithms...

983
01:35:57,502 --> 01:35:58,958
Into the batcomputer...

984
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:02,662
And created a virtual simulation.

985
01:36:02,966 --> 01:36:05,048
I'd like to help Batman and Robin.

986
01:36:05,301 --> 01:36:06,882
I anticipated you would...

987
01:36:07,053 --> 01:36:10,511
And took the Liberty
fo create something in your size.

988
01:36:11,766 --> 01:36:13,848
Suit me up, uncle Alfred.

989
01:37:34,766 --> 01:37:36,051
Hi there.

990
01:37:40,271 --> 01:37:42,933
Is your thumb
the only part of you that's green?

991
01:37:43,399 --> 01:37:46,232
You will just have to find out.

992
01:37:46,861 --> 01:37:48,601
Robin:
I want us to be together...

993
01:37:48,780 --> 01:37:51,567
But you must be serious
about turning over a new leaf.

994
01:37:53,284 --> 01:37:54,364
I need a sign...

995
01:37:55,244 --> 01:37:57,360
How about "slippery when wet."

996
01:37:57,580 --> 01:37:58,911
Of trust.

997
01:37:59,082 --> 01:38:00,618
Tell me your plan.

998
01:38:00,875 --> 01:38:02,456
Kiss me and I'll tell you.

999
01:38:03,378 --> 01:38:05,289
Tell me and I'll kiss you.

1000
01:38:06,672 --> 01:38:11,462
Freeze has taken the new telescope
and turned it into a giant freezing gun.

1001
01:38:11,803 --> 01:38:14,419
He's about to turn Gotham
into an ice cube.

1002
01:38:15,681 --> 01:38:17,262
I've got to stop him.

1003
01:38:17,433 --> 01:38:19,765
One kiss, my love.

1004
01:38:20,937 --> 01:38:22,393
For luck.

1005
01:38:35,410 --> 01:38:37,150
Bad luck, I'm afraid.

1006
01:38:37,995 --> 01:38:39,986
Time to die, little Robin.

1007
01:38:43,209 --> 01:38:45,541
I hate to disappoint you...

1008
01:38:49,632 --> 01:38:52,294
But rubber lips are immune to
your charms.

1009
01:38:59,517 --> 01:39:00,848
See you!

1010
01:39:02,728 --> 01:39:05,515
You're not the only one
who can set a trap, Venus.

1011
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:09,683
Sorry, my vines have a crush on you.

1012
01:39:17,827 --> 01:39:18,862
Got to go.

1013
01:39:19,036 --> 01:39:22,494
So many people to kill,
so little time.

1014
01:39:31,966 --> 01:39:33,672
You're about to become compost.

1015
01:39:41,350 --> 01:39:45,218
Using feminine wiles to get what
you want? Trading on your looks?

1016
01:39:45,396 --> 01:39:48,888
Read a book. That passive-aggressive
number went out long ago.

1017
01:39:49,108 --> 01:39:51,190
Chicks like you
give women a bad name.

1018
01:40:11,589 --> 01:40:15,298
As I told lady fries
when I pulled her plug...

1019
01:40:15,885 --> 01:40:17,591
This is a one-woman show.

1020
01:40:18,012 --> 01:40:19,377
I don't think so.

1021
01:40:41,118 --> 01:40:42,449
Curses!

1022
01:40:42,662 --> 01:40:43,947
No!

1023
01:40:58,469 --> 01:41:00,084
Freeze is going to ice the city.

1024
01:41:00,304 --> 01:41:01,589
I know.

1025
01:41:01,764 --> 01:41:03,971
- And you are?
- Batqirl.

1026
01:41:04,141 --> 01:41:07,679
That's not p.C.
What about batperson or batwoman?

1027
01:41:08,062 --> 01:41:11,304
Bruce, it's me, Barbara.
I found the batcave.

1028
01:41:11,566 --> 01:41:13,022
We must change the locks.

1029
01:41:13,192 --> 01:41:15,353
She knows who we are.
“We must kill her.

1030
01:41:15,611 --> 01:41:17,852
Yep. We'll kill her later.
We have work to do.

1031
01:41:37,216 --> 01:41:40,128
I et's kick some ice.

1032
01:41:40,678 --> 01:41:42,009
Yes

1033
01:41:50,187 --> 01:41:51,393
Yes

1034
01:42:05,036 --> 01:42:08,199
Yes yes yes

1035
01:43:08,182 --> 01:43:10,423
We have less than 11 minutes
to thaw the city.

1036
01:43:37,962 --> 01:43:39,077
(Gotchal

1037
01:43:40,131 --> 01:43:41,621
now!

1038
01:43:50,933 --> 01:43:52,093
Shield.

1039
01:44:13,664 --> 01:44:15,325
Mr. freeze:
I'll finish off the city.

1040
01:44:15,499 --> 01:44:17,740
You kill the kids

1041
01:44:17,960 --> 01:44:20,497
- but leave me the bat.
Bane: Bat!

1042
01:44:40,399 --> 01:44:42,355
Robin: No sign of the snowman.

1043
01:44:42,526 --> 01:44:44,312
Maybe he melted.

1044
01:44:44,528 --> 01:44:46,564
No, he's just hibernating.

1045
01:45:04,590 --> 01:45:05,921
These heaters will thaw them.

1046
01:45:13,849 --> 01:45:15,760
I hope you've got
10 million more of those.

1047
01:45:15,935 --> 01:45:18,392
Robin: Eight minutes
and they're ice cubes forever.

1048
01:45:18,562 --> 01:45:20,518
Sunlight could reverse
the freezing process.

1049
01:45:20,689 --> 01:45:22,554
Sunrise isn't for five hours.
Here

1050
01:45:22,733 --> 01:45:24,098
it's morning in the Congo.

1051
01:45:24,318 --> 01:45:27,060
Batman: We'll relay sunlight...
Robin: From below the equator...

1052
01:45:27,238 --> 01:45:29,695
It'll take the satellites
a minute to realign, but...

1053
01:45:30,324 --> 01:45:32,690
- Damn.
- Damn? Damn's not good.

1054
01:45:32,868 --> 01:45:35,575
Those targeting mirrors are frozen.
The beam won't work

1055
01:45:35,746 --> 01:45:37,236
you thaw the mirrors.

1056
01:46:03,440 --> 01:46:04,930
Tonight's forecast:

1057
01:46:05,109 --> 01:46:06,895
A freeze is coming.

1058
01:46:21,458 --> 01:46:22,868
Bye-bye.

1059
01:46:35,931 --> 01:46:37,137
I got you!

1060
01:46:47,651 --> 01:46:49,687
No. I got you.

1061
01:46:57,036 --> 01:46:58,321
Mr. freeze: Yes

1062
01:47:02,958 --> 01:47:04,823
it's one of those days!

1063
01:47:11,050 --> 01:47:12,665
Yes!

1064
01:47:52,383 --> 01:47:53,714
Lee: Yeah! Yes

1065
01:47:58,847 --> 01:48:00,337
Lee:
Dirty fighter, dirty fighter!

1066
01:48:15,114 --> 01:48:16,695
Robin: The tube.

1067
01:48:31,547 --> 01:48:32,787
Lee: Yay, Batman!

1068
01:48:36,677 --> 01:48:37,677
Lee: Oh, no.

1069
01:48:46,228 --> 01:48:48,810
Hey, freeze. The heat is on.

1070
01:49:02,286 --> 01:49:05,323
Batman: You all right down there?
Both: Yeah

1071
01:49:05,539 --> 01:49:06,619
Batman: Here goes.

1072
01:49:35,694 --> 01:49:36,774
Hang on.

1073
01:49:51,835 --> 01:49:53,575
Batman, you're doing it!

1074
01:49:55,005 --> 01:49:56,620
Batman: You've lost, freeze.

1075
01:49:57,174 --> 01:49:58,289
I think not.

1076
01:49:59,676 --> 01:50:01,166
Bombs away, Batman.

1077
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:29,120
Freeze in hell, Batman!

1078
01:50:55,941 --> 01:50:58,648
- What should we do now?
- Pray.

1079
01:51:04,533 --> 01:51:06,023
Batman: Hang on!

1080
01:51:08,954 --> 01:51:10,740
Grab onto my belt!

1081
01:51:30,434 --> 01:51:32,971
Lee: Thank you, Batman!
Woman: Thank youl!

1082
01:51:36,481 --> 01:51:37,971
Need a ride?

1083
01:51:48,493 --> 01:51:50,984
- Most of Gotham's still frozen.
- It's midnight.

1084
01:51:51,413 --> 01:51:53,950
Telescope's gone.
There's no way to thaw the city.

1085
01:51:54,208 --> 01:51:57,245
The satellites could do it,
but it'd take a computer genius.

1086
01:51:57,419 --> 01:51:58,454
I'm on it.

1087
01:51:59,087 --> 01:52:00,327
Batgirl: No, I'm on it.

1088
01:52:06,428 --> 01:52:07,793
Have to do it upside down.

1089
01:52:07,971 --> 01:52:10,462
Men! Everything the hard way.

1090
01:52:13,101 --> 01:52:15,137
Robin:
You're pretty good at this, little girl.

1091
01:52:15,646 --> 01:52:19,230
Well, watch and learn, little boy.

1092
01:53:26,216 --> 01:53:29,049
Looks like it's gonna be a beautiful day.

1093
01:53:36,560 --> 01:53:39,802
Batman: I'm taking you back
to arkham asylum.

1094
01:53:40,731 --> 01:53:42,221
(0 on.

1095
01:53:43,066 --> 01:53:44,397
Kill me too.

1096
01:53:44,609 --> 01:53:46,349
Just as you killed my wife.

1097
01:53:46,528 --> 01:53:48,064
I didn't kill your wife.

1098
01:53:53,118 --> 01:53:57,111
As I told lady fries
when I pulled her plug...

1099
01:53:57,456 --> 01:53:59,822
This is a ohe-womah show.

1100
01:54:05,589 --> 01:54:07,454
Batman: But she's not dead.

1101
01:54:08,258 --> 01:54:10,123
We found her, restored her.

1102
01:54:10,635 --> 01:54:12,921
She's still frozen alive

1103
01:54:13,138 --> 01:54:14,969
waiting for you to find a cure.

1104
01:54:16,266 --> 01:54:17,927
She lives?

1105
01:54:18,143 --> 01:54:20,099
- Yes.
- She lives.

1106
01:54:20,270 --> 01:54:23,603
But vengeance isn't power.
Anyone can take a life.

1107
01:54:24,107 --> 01:54:25,643
But to give life...

1108
01:54:26,151 --> 01:54:28,984
That's true power.
A power you once had.

1109
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:32,111
She's alive.

1110
01:54:37,788 --> 01:54:39,449
So I'm asking you.

1111
01:54:40,457 --> 01:54:41,993
Victor fries

1112
01:54:42,876 --> 01:54:44,787
nelp me save another life.

1113
01:54:45,170 --> 01:54:48,287
Show me how to cure
macgregor's syndrome, stage one.

1114
01:54:48,673 --> 01:54:52,507
And maybe you can also save the life
of the man your wife once loved.

1115
01:54:53,470 --> 01:54:55,586
He's still inside you, Victor.

1116
01:54:56,515 --> 01:54:57,800
Buried.

1117
01:54:57,974 --> 01:55:00,181
Deep beneath the snow.

1118
01:55:02,687 --> 01:55:04,302
Will you help me...

1119
01:55:05,816 --> 01:55:07,306
Doctor?

1120
01:55:31,675 --> 01:55:33,666
Take two of these

1121
01:55:34,928 --> 01:55:36,839
and call me in the morning.

1122
01:55:47,441 --> 01:55:50,399
Batman: I'll have your wife
moved to the lab at arkham.

1123
01:55:50,569 --> 01:55:53,026
You'll be able to continue
your research there.

1124
01:56:16,261 --> 01:56:18,502
All we can do now is wait.

1125
01:56:19,264 --> 01:56:21,095
And hope.

1126
01:56:34,738 --> 01:56:36,103
Poison Ivy: He loves me.

1127
01:56:36,740 --> 01:56:38,480
He loves me not.

1128
01:56:40,035 --> 01:56:41,616
He loves me.

1129
01:56:42,913 --> 01:56:44,904
He loves me not.

1130
01:56:47,292 --> 01:56:49,123
He loves me.

1131
01:56:50,754 --> 01:56:52,585
He loves me not.

1132
01:56:55,091 --> 01:56:56,501
He loves me.

1133
01:56:58,428 --> 01:56:59,634
Mr. freeze: Not!

1134
01:57:01,598 --> 01:57:03,088
Surprise.

1135
01:57:03,266 --> 01:57:05,257
I'm your new cellmate.

1136
01:57:07,521 --> 01:57:11,139
And I've come
to make your life a living hell.

1137
01:57:11,650 --> 01:57:14,642
Prepare for a bitter harvest.

1138
01:57:18,615 --> 01:57:21,948
Winter has come at last.

1139
01:58:03,076 --> 01:58:04,612
Alfred.

1140
01:58:07,497 --> 01:58:08,532
Are you...”

1141
01:58:08,707 --> 01:58:13,326
Rather disappointed at how poorly
I have taught you proper housekeeping.

1142
01:58:13,837 --> 01:58:15,873
And quite well, it seems!

1143
01:58:16,089 --> 01:58:17,454
Thanks to you, son.

1144
01:58:17,674 --> 01:58:19,835
Thanks to you all.

1145
01:58:20,093 --> 01:58:21,674
Well done, Bruce.

1146
01:58:22,012 --> 01:58:24,094
You too. Well done.

1147
01:58:25,515 --> 01:58:27,005
I got one question.

1148
01:58:27,350 --> 01:58:31,013
When we fell off the telescope,
why didn't you try and save us?

1149
01:58:31,187 --> 01:58:33,519
It's the first time I fell
and you weren't there.

1150
01:58:34,024 --> 01:58:35,514
I figured you could handle it.

1151
01:58:35,692 --> 01:58:40,402
You know, sometimes counting on
somebody else is the only way to win.

1152
01:58:43,116 --> 01:58:46,529
Excuse me. I'm the one
who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.

1153
01:58:46,703 --> 01:58:48,034
Yeah, that was me.

1154
01:58:48,204 --> 01:58:50,695
I did it all by myself. That was me.

1155
01:58:50,874 --> 01:58:53,206
You are going back to school.

1156
01:58:53,376 --> 01:58:55,037
You'll never win this argument.

1157
01:59:00,050 --> 01:59:01,381
Partners?

1158
01:59:06,348 --> 01:59:07,929
Partners.

1159
01:59:16,733 --> 01:59:18,439
Partners.

1160
01:59:21,905 --> 01:59:24,066
We're going to need a bigger cave.
