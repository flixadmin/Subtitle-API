1
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,188
Ahh.

2
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,424
Mm. Those are good worms right there.

3
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:16,302
Hey, Alex! How's the commute treating you?

4
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,679
Hey, I can't complain.

5
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:19,820
That never stopped him before. Ha-ha!
Right? Ha.

6
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,913
Well, we made good time today.

7
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,372
Red was one of my students.

8
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,587
Hmm.

9
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:32,965
Not sure about the dabbing though.

10
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,363
Mom! Mom, did you get my picture?

11
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:37,174
Well, this is our stop.

12
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:45,331
♪ The birds in the sky go through the air ♪

13
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:49,085
♪ All the way there ♪

14
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,568
Today, we're gonna learn
about how Red saved the eggs.

15
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:54,424
Yay!
I love Red!

16
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,884
I gotta go to the bathroom!

17
00:01:56,908 --> 00:01:58,649
Why didn't you go in the slingshot?

18
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,515
Bomb, anything from Piggy Island?

19
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,747
No.
Chuck. Anything to the north?

20
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:07,812
Nope. Nothing.
What's that?

21
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:08,771
Uh-oh.

22
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,231
Incoming pie!

23
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:13,043
It's coming straight for us.
What do we do?

24
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:15,778
Duck!

25
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:16,802
What?

26
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:20,380
Ah! I got pie all over my face!
Hey, sorry, buddy.

27
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,551
What, what? Yeah!

28
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,749
Those pigs...

29
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:28,916
Are gonna pay...

30
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,977
For our lunches!

31
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,881
Uh... Because of our hunger to give them...

32
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:36,257
A taste of their own...

33
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,567
Quesadillas!

34
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:40,409
What?

35
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,514
It's Red.
I'm sorry, guys.

36
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,975
We're taking over the Blue Line.
Official business.

37
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,991
Yeah!
Anything for you, Red.

38
00:02:48,395 --> 00:02:49,395
Hey, Red!

39
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:53,024
Isn't it funny how nobody liked you
until you saved Bird Island?

40
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,129
But now we all love you.

41
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:57,904
Ha. Thanks so much for bringing that up.
Okay, ready?

42
00:02:57,928 --> 00:02:59,572
Three...
Two...

43
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,782
Two!

44
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:02,867
Bomb, you say "one."
Oh, right.

45
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:03,891
One!

46
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:13,767
Yoo-hoo! Hot sauce, please.

47
00:03:14,653 --> 00:03:16,506
Yeah! Got him.

48
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,610
Thank you very much.
<i>Red! Red! Red!</i>

49
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:22,136
I really want the red one. The red one.
Ha-ha.

50
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,262
Balloonie!

51
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,824
Heh-heh. That's it. A little bit higher.

52
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,114
Ha-ha.

53
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,237
But I was bouncing!

54
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:41,572
You mess with the hatchlings,

55
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,074
you get the cannonball.

56
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,784
Ready, big guy?

57
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:47,300
Oh, yeah. You ready, bigger guy?

58
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:54,223
Cannonball! Cannonball!

59
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,104
<i>♪ I need a hero ♪</i>

60
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:01,478
Why won't you just take a bath?

Huh?

63
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,166
This might pinch a little.

64
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,111
Agh! I can't see!

65
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:22,321
Catch you later. Heh-heh.

66
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,132
You stupid birds.

67
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:26,472
No! Please, don't!

68
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,636
Not on my watch.

69
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:35,042
Sorry, guys.

70
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,377
Excuse me, sir,

71
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,838
but I believe this belongs to you.

72
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,023
My hero.

73
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:42,592
Don't. Stop.

74
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:44,152
Heh-heh. I said, "Don't stop."

75
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,555
Leonard?
Got him!

76
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:51,072
Hey, Leonard, you should probably...
Huh?

77
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,791
That's not coming from Bird Island.

78
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,074
What the heck is that?

79
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,966
And where did it come from?

80
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,434
We're gonna need a bigger slingshot.

81
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:29,910
Another successful day of protecting
the island.

82
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,934
Great job, guys.
Ha-ha. Oh, yeah.

83
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,644
Woo-hoo! Whee!

84
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,479
You saved us, Red.

85
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:39,690
You're our hero.
What can I say? That's what I do.

86
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:41,651
Now, why don't you run along

87
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:45,089
and keep your big, cute eyes peeled
for the next pig prank, all right?

88
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,387
Pigs.

89
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:53,009
We're going to get you!
Oink, oink, oink.

90
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,540
Ha-ha. Adorable.

91
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,477
Let's finish cleaning up these crabs,
then we can move on to...

92
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,936
Done and done.

93
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:04,465
Red, what is it?
What the heck?

94
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:08,233
Is it a per...? Is it a head? What is that?

95
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:12,390
It seems like it's some kind of note.
What if it's a love note?

96
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:14,934
A message in a bottle?
Or a genie in a bottle.

97
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:18,062
Guys, there's no bottle,
so just, you know, stop.

98
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:21,315
<i>Dear birds,
we humbly request a truce.</i>

99
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,567

Ho, ho, ho. Nice try, piggies.

102
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:31,492
News flash: we're not idiots.

103
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:32,577
Hey.

104
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:33,661
<i>Dear birds,</i>

105
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:37,144
<i>you are idiots,
but we are serious about the truce.</i>

106
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:41,859
Oh...

107
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:48,009
I got it!

108
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,344
Oh, no!
Check it out, everybody.

109
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:51,721
Let me see that.

110
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:54,223
A truce! A truce!
A truce with the pigs!

111
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:57,036
A truce?
The prank war is over! Ha-ha!

112
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,060
What?

113
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,147
No, this is just
another one of their pranks.

114
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,648
What?
Huh?

115
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,483
This is a huge relief, right?

116
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:07,445
Who else was getting tired
of the constant pranking and retaliation?

117
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,238
Me! This guy!

118
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,990
Tired? No, no, no. Guys, listen.

119
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:13,284
Imagine all the fun things we can do now.

120
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:15,369
I can think of one.

121
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:18,331
You think he'll go?
I think we've piqued his interest.

122
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:23,252
No, no, no. Guys, we are working tirelessly,
day and night, to save the world.

123
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,922
The world doesn't need saving, Red.
Of course they need us.

124
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,062
Red.
Huh?

125
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,564
Come here, hon.
What are you so afraid of?

126
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:33,401
Afraid of? I...
What do I have to be afraid of?

127
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,581
♪ All by myself ♪

128
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:45,755
♪ Don't wanna be all by myself ♪

129
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,173
♪ Anymore ♪

130
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,821
I'm not afraid of anything.
Okay, you know what?

131
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,765
I'll write you a prescription
for one night of fun with your cool friends.

132
00:07:53,789 --> 00:07:56,077
Especially Chuck.
Come on.

133
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:57,119
Come with us.

134
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:01,433
What are you talking...? Come with you to what?
We can't tell you because you wouldn't be into it.

135
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,310
Huh?

136
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:09,983
Huh?

137
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,274
Oh. Oh, ho, ho, ho!

138
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:21,457
Oink, oink, oink!
Oink, oink, oink!

139
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,940
Ha! Now we have all your eggs.

140
00:08:25,964 --> 00:08:29,026
Yeah, and there's nothing
you can do about it, Red.

141
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,757
Oink, oink, oink.
Oink, oink, oink.

142
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:35,866
Laugh it up, piggies,
because you're gonna be crying in a second

143
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,286
when I kick your butts and take those rocks back.
Eggs.

144
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,456
What?
You said "rocks" instead of "eggs" again.

145
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,417
Oh, sorry.

146
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,683
I don't know why I keep doing that.

147
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,982
Because they are rocks.

148
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,676
Don't cry, Sam-Sam.

149
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,986
I'll be right back.

150
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,078
Hey, Daddy.
Hrm.

151
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,328
Just borrowing my sisters for a minute.
Hmph.

152
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:16,991
Ha! Now we really have all your eggs.

153
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:20,953
Yeah, and there's nothing
you can do about it, Red.

154
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,621
Oink, oink, oink.
Oink, oink, oink.

155
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,373
Laugh it up, piggies,

156
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:29,062
because you're gonna be crying in a second
when I kick your butts and take all your...

157
00:09:29,194 --> 00:09:34,280
Uh... Uh... Uh... Um, um, um...

158
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,738
Oh, crap.

159
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,543
Okay, we'll just... Aah!

160
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:57,907
What is this thing that almost killed me?
Frozen water?

161
00:09:57,931 --> 00:09:59,492
Who's ever heard of frozen water?

162
00:09:59,516 --> 00:10:02,119
Courtney? Courtney, bring me those images.

163

What, what, what?
Oh, okay, I'm coming. I'm coming.

164
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,540
Give me that.

165
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:08,542
Oh, that looks cold.

166
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:10,933
Three umbrellas in one drink?

167
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:14,403
What kind of extravagant lunatic are
we dealing with?

168
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:19,442

Okay.

My limbs are beginning to numb.

Ha-ha! Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.
You better tell him to improve his aim.

194

It's about time we start living that good life.
Good life, here we come.

You deserve that and more.

Yes, I do!

198
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,635
Whoo-hoo!
Aah!

199
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,957
Well, here we are.

200
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:15,294
Are you ready, Red? Love awaits! Huh?

201
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,755
Speed dating? No. No way.

202
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,423
It's mating season.

203
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,426
All right, lovebirds.
You all know how this works.

204
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,566
When you hear this sound,

205
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:27,056
then it's time to move on to the next table,

206
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,850
where your soul mate just might be waiting.

207
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:33,437
Yeah, I'm going home.
Absolutely not. You have nothing else to do.

208
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:38,442
Also, I hid your keys on some part of my body and
I'm not telling you where unless you stay. Ha-ha-ha!

209
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,277
Yeah, let's party!

210
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,697
Hey, yo! Chuck's the name. Speed's the game. Like games?
Well...

211
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:48,182
You just entered the love lottery, and guess what.
You won! Because here I am.

212
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,347
Hi.
Hi. Heh-heh.

213
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,271
I eat dirt.

214
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,380
Oh! Ew.

215
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:00,673
Hey, y'all!

216
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,758
Who's ready to party?

217
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,386
Oh, heh... Not me.

218
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,223
No, I'm actually not here for the whole
speed-dating horror-show thing going on.

219
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,559
Shh. This mating dance is for you.

221

I'd love to hear a little bit about you.
What's your favorite sign?

222
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,157
This one's mine. Ha-ha-ha.

223
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:31,078
The flavor can vary greatly,
depending on the minerals in the dirt.

224
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:34,164
I can tell which kind of worms have
crawled through there.

225
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:38,168
Or what sort of roly-polies used it
to raise their family in.

226
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,728
Um, are you mad?

227
00:13:40,171 --> 00:13:41,171
No.

228
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:43,716
I don't know. You look mad.
Well, I'm not.

229
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,759
Yeah, you know what?
Maybe it's your eyebrows.

230
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,012
My eyebrows are fine.
That's just the way I look.

231
00:13:48,036 --> 00:13:51,029
It's like you've got resting bird face.

232
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,247
Oh, yeah? Well, you know,
that's not a thing.

233
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,271
Yes! Amazing.
With utensils. I'm not a total animal.

234
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,315
But I do enjoy eating dirt.
Ugh.

235
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,734
Okay, worms, birdseed
or just garbage from a dumpster?

236
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,902
I'm sorry, what?
Favorite food, silly.

237
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,821
Don't think.
Just answer from your gut. Go!

238
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,573
Uh... Toast?

239
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,616
Okay. Toast.

240
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,201
Favorite color?
Uh...

241
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,137
Oh. Stupid question. Red, duh.

242
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,081
If you could have one superpower,
what would it be?

243
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,438
Um, to disappear, like, right now.

244
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,545
Okay. What do you do in your free time?

245
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:24,465
Yeah, I mean,
I don't really have any free time.

246
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:28,635
I protect Bird Island from being attacked,
and that's a full-time gig, so yeah.

247
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,637
I thought I heard something about
a truce.

248
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:33,515
Ha-ha-ha. No. A truce, no.
That's not gonna last.

249
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:37,311
You'll have a lot more free time
now that nobody needs you anymore, so... Heh-heh.

250
00:14:37,335 --> 00:14:39,201
Okay. We are done here.

251
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:43,233
Are you afraid to talk about your feelings?

252
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:47,112
Hey, you know, just because I don't want
to talk about them doesn't mean I'm afraid.

253
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:50,908
Okay. So avoids personal questions. Unusually angry.
Talks to herself.

254
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:53,285
Self-esteem issues.
Doesn't answer her own questions.

255
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,789
Left-handed. Probably a witch.
Looks like we're definitely incompatible.

256
00:14:56,813 --> 00:14:59,208
Oh, and you needed a form
to tell you that. Okay.

257
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:03,545
I hope you have better luck annoying the next guy.
I don't need luck. I have a formula.

258
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:05,089
Okay. Have a nice life.

259
00:15:05,113 --> 00:15:07,446
Have fun being alone.
Oh, I will.

260
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:11,553
Aww. There he goes,
like a ship in the night.

261
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,848
No rudder, no purpose, no crew.

262
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,613

279
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:51,834
You wanted to talk.

280
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,907
This is not how a truce works.

That image in your hand is Eagle Island,

298
00:17:59,829 --> 00:18:01,390
and those are eagles.

299
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:04,017
Eagles? How did you get these?

300
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,769
From a drone.
Oh.

301
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:09,106
And do you spy on us with that?
Yes.

302
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,942
So have you seen me, um...?

303
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:14,379
Yes, and it's disgusting.

304
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,364
Red, this is bigger than pranks.

305
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:20,075
We need to put aside our differences
and work together.

306
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:23,453
To save our whole world
from being destroyed.

310
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,819
Wonderful!

311
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,261
We'll have to get a team together.

312
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:40,846
Yes, we will.

313
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,611
But, hey, I'm in charge.

314
00:18:44,874 --> 00:18:47,352
Actually, that position's been filled.

315
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:50,494
Booya!
Yeah. By me.

316

00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:08,915
<i>We've got a number two
at the Porta Potty.</i>

321
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:09,939
Aah!

322
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:13,066
All right, I'm going!

323
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,739
We're busting you out.

324
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,866
Uh... How?

325
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,491
Like that.

326
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,080
Oh, I love it.

327
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,229
Bomb, what was that noise?

328
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:34,691
You're still grounded!
I'm an adult, Mom!

329
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,943
Run.
Bomb, get back here!

330
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:41,031
This guy is so fast,
he can beat time itself in a footrace.

331
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:43,450
Hey, Chuck, we're putting together a team.

332
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:45,636
And I think we're on it!

333
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,439
Come on, everybody.
Let's work those booties!

334
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,120
I'm in.

335
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,938
Ha-ha! Great!
But how did you...?

336
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:16,066
BT-dubs, you misspelled "heist."
It's "EI," not "IE." I corrected it.

337
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:18,985
Don't worry. It's a common misperception.
Well, thank you.

338
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:22,423
Ha-ha-ha.
You're right. He's fast.

339
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:27,869
<i>Now, this guy is kind of a ding-dong,
but he's the only eagle we know.</i>

340
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,205
Well, you've come to the right eagle.

341
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:33,959
Tell me more.
It's a really exciting mission to a place called Eagle...

342
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:36,294
Eagle Island?!
Yes.

343
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,809
So you've heard...

344
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,771
Heard of it.
Aah!

345
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:46,694
Nice to meet you!

346
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:51,518
Okay, so now we just need to figure out
how this volcanic super-weapon works, huh?

347
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:55,188
We're gonna need some kind of
engineering wizard, brainiac.

348
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:59,081
Hmm.
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

349
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,383
♪ Ooh ♪

350
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:05,741
Yes, Chuck. You obviously have something
you want to say or sing.

351
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:08,599
I have got just the guy. It's a girl.

352
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,203
My sister Silver.

353
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,330
She goes to Avian Academy, top of her class.

354
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,188
She would be perfect.
Yeah, she totally would.

355
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,962
See you guys back at the dorm!
Yeah, see you, Ella.

356
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:21,381
Hey, good catch!

357
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,593
I mean, we all just thought
she was weird, you know?

358
00:21:24,617 --> 00:21:27,679
But she skipped four grades,
won a Junior Engineer of the Year Award,

359
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:31,850
and then got a scholarship at Avian Academy.
Perfect. That is exactly what we're looking for.

360
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:35,020
You are absolutely gonna love her.
But don't love her too much.

361
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,396
That's my sister, Red.

362
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,149
Or I'll crush every bone in your body!

363
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:40,835
Ooh. Frisbee!

364
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:45,677
Hi, I'm Chuck.
Know where the engineering department is?

365
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:52,037
With a combination of over 30 silk, wire
and cotton-based threads spun together,

366
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:54,039
I now present to you...

367
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:55,770
Super String!

368
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,712
Ahem. I said, "It's Super String!"

369
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,047
More like "Stupid String."

370
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:05,926
I know what you're thinking, Mike.
You're like, "What's so super about it?"

371
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,385
Great question, Mike.

372
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:12,516
Well, how about that it's very easily able
to withstand the pull of 18,000 more kilos

373
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,951
than any other string known to...

374
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,939
Snooze alert.
Known to bird-kind!

375
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,875
Or pig-kind, for that matter.

376
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,862
What's up, sis?

377
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,030
Chuck?

378
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,866
I'm so happy to... It's really...
I'm so happy to... It's really...

379
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:32,160
great to... Jinx, jinx.
great to... Jinx, jinx.

380
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,995
Jinx!
Jinx. One, two, three. I win!

381
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:38,684
You can't speak until someone says your name.
Hello? You in here?

382
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:40,565
Hello?

383
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,858
You?
You?

384
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,589
You.

385
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,675
Wait. You know this guy?

386
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,969
I would answer, but you jinxed me.

387
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:51,763
Oh, okay, Chuck, I unjinx you.

388
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,641
This is one of
my best buddies, Red. These are the guys.

389
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:55,826
Hi.
We're the guys.

390
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,187
Guys, this is Silver,
the greatest kid sister in the world.

391
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,481
I'm not exactly a kid anymore, Chuck.

392
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:05,402
Oh, you'll always be my kid sister!
Okay. Hey, everyone.

393
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:08,154
You know, I don't think this is gonna work.

394
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:11,512
It's just that I'm not sure
you're gonna be compatible with the team.

395
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:16,705
Oh, wow, it is such a pleasure
to meet not you, but you!

396
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:21,042
I've never met a pig before.
Your technological achievements are amazing.

397
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,712
May I shake your hoof?
Why, thank you. Heh-heh.

398
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,193
I like her.

399
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:28,466
And this has to be Bomb.
Whoa!

400
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,803
How'd you know that?
Because you have a fuse coming out of your head.

401
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,263
Oh, so cool!

402
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:35,140
Ssst. Shaboom!

403
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:36,933
Oh! Backflip.

404
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:41,479
So I hear you're some kind of
engineering wizard or whatever.

405
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,246
Oh, heh. I don't like to brag, but...

406
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:48,588
Wait. Who's that? And why is she
all over these achievement awards?

407
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:55,118
The kid's amazing, right?
Not a kid anymore, Chuck.

408
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:59,205
Toot, toot! Tickle Train arriving at Sister Station!
Chuck, no.

409
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,541
I am a serious academic.

410
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,022
I am a serious... Ha-ha-ha!

411
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,188
Stop!

412
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:09,733

Gotcha!

Woo-hoo!

423
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:32,948
We did it.

424
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:35,450
That was so easy!

425
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,910
Yeah!

426
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:39,704
A little too easy, actually.

427
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,331
What do you mean by that?

428
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:44,209
Well, normally, when things are this easy,

429
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:48,713
some dramatically unexpected setback occurs.

430
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,674
I don't get it.
Me neither.

431
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:53,969
Well, it's kind of hard to explain.

432
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,701
But it's sort of like, you know how some...?

433
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:03,853
Oh, see? Like that.

434
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,834
Are you freaking kidding me?

435
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,753
Each of you has been selected
because you're the best in your field.

436
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,785
Oh!
That we could find.

437
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:22,080
Oh.
Your skills will be put to the test

438
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:24,312
facing this.

439
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:27,794
As you can clearly see, this is a vol...
Volcano. Heh.

440
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:31,256
"A volcano" is
what my assistant was going to say.

441
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,425
Assistant? You're the assistant!
Let go. Let go.

442
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:35,093
No, I'm the leader.
I'll take that.

443
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:37,887
Actually, it's a composite volcano.

444
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,765
You can tell by the height
and the clearly apparent vent clusters.

445
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,059
Okay, forget I said "volcano."

446
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,996
This is a, um... It's a super-weapon!

447
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,274
Weird because it looks just like a volcano.

448
00:25:49,298 --> 00:25:52,110
Yep, and here's the scary part.

449
00:25:52,134 --> 00:25:54,842
This is their psychotic leader!

450
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:59,492
Oop! Heh. How'd that get in there? Next.

451
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:01,161
Oh, butt shot.
Next.

452
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:04,105
No, no. Next. Next!
I don't even know what I'm looking at.

453
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:07,542
Courtney!
I mean, you took them.

454
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,461
Ahem. Ahem!

455
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:12,273
This is their psychotic leader.

456
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:21,904
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey. Buddy, do you know her?

457
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,933
What? Me? No.

458
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:27,062
No, definitely not, absolutely not.
Never seen her before in my life.

459
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:29,203
Who is that? I don't know!

460
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:33,443
Not terribly convincing, but moving on.
Great.

461
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:34,674
What's the plan?

462
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:37,113
All right, here's what we're looking at,
folks.

463
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:40,617
Step one: Travel undetected to Eagle Island.

464
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:42,869
Uh-huh.
Step two:

465
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:46,386
We're gonna break into the super-weapon.

466
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:48,958
Got it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

467
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,335
And step three:

468
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:53,568
Hoo-hoo!
Deactivate the super-weapon.

469
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:56,633
Once we break in there.
No plan...

470
00:26:56,657 --> 00:27:02,494
Hopefully, before both our islands are destroyed
and we all die, so that's, uh... That's it.

471
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:06,810
Right. I just have a few questions.
Why? I explained everything.

472
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:09,854
It's a foolproof plan.
Yeah. How do we sneak onto the island?

473
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,190
What is the super-weapon
and how do we deactivate it?

474
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:16,903
And when you say "escape," how do you plan to do that?
I feel like this is a crucial thing to figure out.

475
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:18,863
I agree. Why isn't she in charge?

476
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,281
Told you she's super smart.

477
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:22,075
Hey, guys, hold on a second, please.

478
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:24,577
Mighty Eagle?
What? What? What are you looking at?

479
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,663
Do you have an Eagle Island map?

480
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:29,395
What? No. No, there's no map.

481
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:31,835
Oh, it's a map.
Yeah, that's a map.

482
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:32,961
Mm-hm.

483
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,629
Okay, I just wanna read it.
Come on!

484
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,519
Wait a minute. Do you guys hear that?

485
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,731
Do we hear what?
Sounds like a whistle.

486
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,156
It almost sounds like a:

487
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,409
Hey, guys?

488
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,161
Run!

489
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:54,250
Emergency exit, all the way down!

490
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,611
Well, that's not safe.

491
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,572
Wait! Stop!

492
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:03,088
Holy macaroni!
Oh, boy.

493
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,257
Everyone hop on!

494
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:21,176
Rewind it. Rewind it. Play it again.

495
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,566
Play it again. Play it again.

496
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:28,099
Yes, baby! We knocked the top right off of that!
Blow them up!

497
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,976
Glenn, you didn't mess it up this time.

498
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,936
Boom! Up top. Or not.
Nailed it!

499
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,104
Jerry, up top.

500
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,940
That should send him running.
Wait. "Him"?

501
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,546
Who you sending running?

502
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:40,111
Yeah. Who's "him"?

503
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:44,630
"Them." I said "them."
Stop asking me stupid questions.

504
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,134
I'm so sorry.

505
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:48,661
That was crazy.
We could have died.

506
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:53,271
Thanks for saving our lives, Mighty Eagle!
Well, you can always count on...

507
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:02,989
Everyone grab the map!

508
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,582
Hey, it's working.

509
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:16,628
Left! Left! Lean to the left!

510
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:20,341
Whew.

511
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,112
Please tell me that was your pants ripping.

512
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,781
I don't wear pants!

513
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:27,593
None of us wear pants!

514
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,560
Uh-oh.

515
00:29:39,653 --> 00:29:41,235
Eight point one seconds.

516
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,656
Silver! No!

517
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:07,991
Oh!

518
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:10,118
Uh, heh...
Heh-heh...

519
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,134
Hey! What is this?

520
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:17,542
Oh, um, well, I mean, she was, you know,
just thanking me for saving everyone, so...

521
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:18,835
I'm sorry. Saving everyone?

522
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:22,255
Yeah. I mean, you know, the map was my idea.
It ripped.

523
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:25,818
Maybe because there's one too many birds on the team.
I...

524
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,530
My mountain!

525
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:33,725
We are in trouble.

526
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:36,867
We gotta stop that super-weapon.
We gotta stop that super-weapon. Jinx!

527
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,859
Oh, this is bad. This is really bad.

528
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:43,999
Eagle Mountain?

529
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,046
Are we gonna be okay?

530
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:49,595
Oh, my gah...

531
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:54,263
What happened to Eagle Mountain, Mom?

532
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:59,848
Wait a minute. Wait. Wait. Wait.
Why isn't anybody leaving? Why they not scared?

533
00:31:01,151 --> 00:31:03,379
Okay. Oh, okay, okay.

534
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,715
Here's what we gonna do.

535
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:08,676
I want y'all to take all of those ice balls

536
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,387
and fill them up with, ha-ha...

537
00:31:11,411 --> 00:31:13,323
molten lava.

538
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:17,101
That's not possible.

539
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,412
What?
You never heard of thermal emulsifiers?

540
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,273
Uh... Well, yes, yes.

541
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:25,610
You just got to get a polyacrylamide
to enhance the nanoparticle

542
00:31:25,634 --> 00:31:28,217
and surfactant association
between the two materials.

543
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:30,740
Okay.

544
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:34,285
So you do that,
and I'm gonna go feed my baby.

545
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:38,498
Yes, I'm finally gonna feed my baby.
There you go. Who's my baby?

546
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:39,808
You're my baby.

547
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:44,837
What...? Don't...

548
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:47,774
You better not wink at me.
Don't you wink at me.

549
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,929
Who could have done this?

550
00:31:52,953 --> 00:31:55,765
Gosh, I can't believe it's gone.
Red, are we gonna be okay?

551
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:58,643
What are we gonna do?
All right, guys, do not worry.

552
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,144
We got this.

553
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,688
Red here has got your back.

554
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:04,399
And your front and your sides.

555
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:05,691
And my floof?

556
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:10,321
Yeah, even your cute little floof.
Looks like you're gonna be okay.

557
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:14,283
So are you 100 percent sure
we shouldn't evacuate?

558
00:32:14,307 --> 00:32:16,744
No, Red's gonna take care of us.
Right, Red?

559
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:20,373
Yes! Everybody, please, just stay calm.

560
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:23,626
Great news! Thank you!
Hey, y'all, we're gonna be okay. Red's here.

561
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,878
We love you, Red!
We need you, Red!

562
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:26,921
Oh, thank you.

563
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,811
Your support means the world to me.

564
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,198
Okay, Leonard, so where's our ride?

565
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,430
Aww.

566
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:37,223
It's so cute.

567
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:40,935
Wow. Okay. And how are we all supposed
to fit in...?

568
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,417
Oh, I think we'll manage. Boop.

569
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:48,460
Whoa, okay.

570
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:52,843
Whoa.

571
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:02,599
Oh, my gah...

572
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:04,184
All aboard!

573
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:09,228
Anyone want to grab their own bag
or anything?

574
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,154
Don't screw this up, Red!

575
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:20,037
If we die, it's kind of your fault.

576
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:25,493
Hoo. I got this.

577
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,136
Wow.

578
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:20,618
Ba-Ba-Ba-Ba-bap!
Ow!

579
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:22,745
Ladies and gentlemen,

580
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:26,249
I'd like to introduce you
to our master of gadgetry:

581
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:27,730
Garry!
Garry!

582
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:30,776
This is it?

583
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:35,174
This is the amazing team
I've been working around the clock for?

584
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,906
Heh. Working with what we got.

585
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:41,031
Well, that's disappointing.

586
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,558
Wow. Okay.

587
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:47,496
This is the part where you get up
and follow me!

588
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:52,483
Welcome to my piggy gadget lab.

589
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,985
Oh, yeah.

590
00:34:54,009 --> 00:34:59,824
Everywhere you look, you'll see inventions
being tested by my team of guinea pigs.

591
00:34:59,848 --> 00:35:02,306
This is so cool.
I know. Right?

592
00:35:02,851 --> 00:35:07,707
All of the gadgets have been designed specifically
with your current mission in mind.

593
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:10,439
The first being Invisa-Spray.

594
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,504
Need to go undetected in plain sight?

595
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,965
Invisa-Spray does exactly that.

596
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:17,776
Wow, I'm invisible!

597
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:20,428
Whoa!
"Whoa," indeed.

598
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:23,365
That's amazing.
How long does the invisibility last for?

599
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:25,516
Forever.

600
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,101
Wait. What?

601
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:30,229
Tina, we're not gonna be able
to see each other tonight.

602
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:33,316
And what does the next gadget do?
Bury us alive?

603
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,068
What? That would be ridiculous.

604
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:38,529
Ix-nay the shovel-ay.

605
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,590
And moving right along.

606
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,172
What? What are you guys doing?

607
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,328
This is so fun!

608
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:46,704
Oh, it's so squishy.

609
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:48,247
What is this stuff?

610
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:52,515
Well, that is a special type of
flame retardant we call pig snot.

611
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:56,853
Why do you call it...?
You know what? Never mind.

612
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:59,238
Uhh. Yuck.

613
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,033
Uh...

614
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:06,807
Yeah! Lick it.

615
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:11,872
Now, everyone, prepare yourselves
because this next one is really something special.

616
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:14,565
Whoa. So shiny.

617
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:18,986
Yes, my friend. Bold yet sleek.
Simple while complex.

618
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:23,971
This device can detect an eagle anywhere
within a 100-foot radius.

619
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:30,331
Well, how does it work?
Simply push this button,

620
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:32,267
and it does the rest.

621
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:34,015
Whoa.
Whoa.

622
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,629
Ooh!
Oh-ho-ho!

623
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:38,297
<i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

624
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,925
<i>There's an eagle nearby.
There's an eagle nearby.</i>

625
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:42,781
Uh...
<i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

626
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:47,098
<i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>
Why, yes. Clearly, there is.

627
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:49,558
Okay, you got me, guys.
<i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

628
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:52,561
This clever little thing will...
<i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

629
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,855
no doubt prove to be a...
<i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

630
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:58,442
crucial tool during your mission.
<i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

631
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,778
Wonderful. That's amazing!
<i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

632
00:37:00,802 --> 00:37:02,780
Can you turn it off now?
<i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

633
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:05,204
Actually, it'll turn itself off.
<i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

634
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,326
Oh, thank goodness.

635
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,621
One hour after it doesn't detect
any more eagles.

636
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,289
What?!
<i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

637
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,999
<i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>
Hey! Hey!

638
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,168
<i>There's an eagle near...</i>

639
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,671
There.
Oh, thank you.

640
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:21,340
Okay, guys, these gadgets are Terri...

641
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:24,198
Hey, hey, Red, can we chat for a sec?

642
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,055
I can tell you're used to running the show.
That's great and all.

643
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,892
But maybe since we're all a team here,
a team you put together,

644
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:35,187
maybe you can try to be more supportive.

645
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:38,232
The results might surprise you, huh?

646
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,192
Fine. Fine, fine, fine.

647
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:43,988
Garry. Whoo! Unbelievable.
Really, really good stuff.

648
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:46,699
You know what?
I'm sure I can figure out a plan to...

649
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:50,763
You know, to use all this...
This awesomeness that you've, um... Bomb!

650
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:55,850
Hi, Red.

651
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:04,985
Oh... How are we ever gonna get up there?

652
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:09,013
I want my unborn sisters back.

653
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:12,641
It's just, the eggs are up there,
and we're down here.

654
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:15,954
Oh, how are we ever gonna get up there?

655
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:17,878
Aww.

656
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:33,684
You're doing great, Zoe.

657
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,804
Now hold it tight, okay?

658
00:38:44,531 --> 00:38:46,050
Uh-oh.

659
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:47,360
Quick, let some air out!

660
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:56,894
It won't untie!

661
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,938
Okay, let me try.

662
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:01,249
Aah!
What's...? What's the prob...?

663
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,289

669
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,741
We got you for reals now.

670
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:55,599
See? I told you I would get us out of this.

671
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,605
A boa constructor.

672
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:17,614
It is glorious! I'm a genius!

673
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,899
Yes, I love it! This was my idea.

674
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:26,942
Wait. Wait.
Look out!

675
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:29,695
Aah! I'm burning!
I told you to look out.

676
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:33,657
Glenn, I wanted lava balls,
not lava puddles.

677
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:36,493
Uh-oh. Glenn's messing up.

678
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:41,081
I mean, we... We're very close.
We just need two more weeks.

679
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:43,292
Two weeks? Two weeks.

680
00:40:43,316 --> 00:40:44,710
Huh.
Um...

681
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:46,587
It's quite the undertaking.

682
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:50,049
Okay, okay, you know what?
I'm doing that thing again.

683
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:55,179
That thing, you know, like, where I'm not quite sure
I heard what I think I heard.

684
00:40:55,203 --> 00:41:00,100
Hey, skinny, sassy face! Did you hear
"two weeks," or did you hear "tomorrow"?

685
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,393
Um... Uh...

686
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:03,145
I heard "tomorrow"?

687
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,814
Fat dude, what did you hear?
Uh...

688
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,441
Definitely what you said?

689
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,193
Okay, you know what I'm gonna do?

690
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:11,987
I am gonna call my old engineer, Steve.

691
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:13,843
And you know what? You're a lot like him.

692
00:41:16,683 --> 00:41:17,993
<i>Hey, it's Steve!</i>

693
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:21,556
<i>Sorry I can't come to the phone right now,
but you know what to do.</i>

694
00:41:22,522 --> 00:41:25,876
Oh, yeah. I had to discipline Steve.

695
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,505
So, what was that that you had said to me?
Tomorrow.

696
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:32,146
That's what I thought you said.
See, everybody happy now.

Okay, guys, let's do this.

00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:40,451
Here we go.
We got an island to save, kids.

707

Two islands. We have two islands to save.

I can't do this.

709
00:42:45,021 --> 00:42:47,855
I've made a terrible mistake.
What are you talking about?

710
00:42:49,192 --> 00:42:50,210
Zeta.

711
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,671
Who is Zeta?
The leader of the eagles.

712
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:55,382
The one who's been trying
to destroy our islands.

713
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:58,552
And my ex-fiancée.

714
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,804
Wait. What?!
Did you say "fiancée"?

715
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:04,321
Beyoncé?

Many of you didn't know that about me.
Well, actually...

740
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:20,134
I assume she's been heartbroken ever since.

741

It's all my fault.

Well, they didn't see us.

771
00:46:36,419 --> 00:46:38,730
This isn't an "us" thing, Silver.

No. No, I don't need your help, okay?

775
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:00,519
I meant to slip. Leave me alone!

776

Your hat fell off.

777
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:05,812
Yeah, I got rid of it
because it was getting heavy.

778
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:17,769

All right, I'll do the talking. Ahem.

791
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:59,519
Hello, fellow eagle guards.

792
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,687
Hm?
Hm?

793
00:48:00,711 --> 00:48:02,481
Oh, no. He's doing a voice.

794
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:05,150
I'm running late to the old job.

795
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:08,153
Commute was rough today for some reason.

796
00:48:08,177 --> 00:48:11,511
But the good news is I made it!

797
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,242
Ninety-degree turn. Quick!

798
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:17,179
But the good news is I made it.

799
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,094
ID, please.

800
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:21,833
Oh, uh... ID?

801
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:24,669
Ha. Not sure I have it on me.

802
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,561
Act like you're checking your pockets.
It's stuck!

803
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:32,135
Stuck? Aah! What the heck are you doing?!

804
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,763
<i>Guards, be on the alert
for a possible intruder.</i>

805
00:48:34,787 --> 00:48:36,073
Wait a minute.

806
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:38,489
What's happening? Leonard?
Shh. He's on to us.

807
00:48:40,042 --> 00:48:41,186
Hmm.

808
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:42,938
We are so dead.

809
00:48:42,962 --> 00:48:47,651
All right. I know what's going on here.
I'm picking up what you're putting down.

810
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:50,884
Jerry, are you getting a load of this?
Yeah, I think I am.

811
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:56,840
Yeah, Jerry, I know exactly what's going on.

812
00:48:58,352 --> 00:48:59,934
This right here...

813
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:02,937
is obviously...

814
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:04,793
a new guy!

815
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:07,355
Yeah, impostors in a costume. Wait. What?

816
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:08,693
Oh.
Uh?

817
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:10,382
Huh?
Huh?

818
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:13,570
Yeah! You're the new guard
for the east tower.

819
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:17,055
Yes.

820
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:19,516
Yes, I am.

821
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,601
Ha-ha-ha. I knew it.

822
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:24,493
Jerry, swipe the new guy in.
Okay.

823
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:27,830
Thank you so much.

824
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:31,403
Okay, guys, we're in.

825
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:33,293
Oh, yeah.
Woo-hoo!

826
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:36,700
We did it.
Work it. Work it.

827
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:38,743
Okay, okay.
Wiggle the butt.

828
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:41,350
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Uh-huh.
Huh?

829
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:49,310
♪ I'm on fire ♪

830
00:49:50,446 --> 00:49:52,312
Come on, come on. Let's go. Let's go!

831
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:57,242
♪ Baby, baby, baby ♪

832
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:07,189
Get to the top of the super-weapon. Check!
Oh...

833
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:09,000
Yay! You did it.

834
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:16,428
Okay, so how's it looking down there?
Ooh. Do you see that?

835
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:19,409
Oh, it's the super-weapon.

836
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:22,517
No, the power supply to the super-weapon.

837
00:50:22,811 --> 00:50:26,708
All we gotta do is get down there
and cut it.

838
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:31,852
Okay, assuming we don't get electrocuted,
there are guards there, there and there.

839
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:34,925
And we don't have enough rope to...

840
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:37,817
Watch and learn.
What? What are you doing?

841
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,072
He's not clipped in.

842
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:48,230
Red, are you crazy?

843
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:50,837
Trust me. I know what I'm do...

844
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:04,704
So yeah. Rope wasn't long enough.
I know that.

845
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:06,873
It wasn't supposed to be.
That's part of my plan.

846
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:10,001
Except I wanted to be over on that side.

847
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:12,517
Okay, but...
Watch this! Aah!

848
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:18,940
Nope. No, no, no.

849
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:22,155
Oh. Hello.

850
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:26,414
Hi. Now my plan really starts.

851
00:51:35,945 --> 00:51:36,945
Hi again.

852
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:40,009
I swung back over to tell you something,
but I forgot what it was. Okay, bye.

853
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:44,967
Got it. Got it. Okay, there we go.
There we go. Grip, grip, grip. Okay...

854
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:48,915
Huh?

855
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:49,975
You hear something?

856
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:54,476
So you want a push?
Yes.

857
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:01,027
Hi.
Oh, no. Your feather!

858
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:02,700
The guards!

859
00:52:04,413 --> 00:52:05,413
Watch out.

860
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:09,248
Silver, what are you doing?

861
00:52:24,243 --> 00:52:25,243
Oh, no.

862
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:26,661
Where's Red?

863
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,288
Hey, Silver.

864
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:29,372
Check it out.

865
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:32,309
This is how a hero saves the world.

866
00:52:33,025 --> 00:52:34,482
Ha-ha!

867
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:39,382
Oh, come on! Nothing works around here!

868
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,113
Now we escape.

869
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:50,352
You two are coming with me.

870
00:52:50,376 --> 00:52:52,771
I, uh...
Nice abs.

871
00:52:52,795 --> 00:52:53,876
I know.

872
00:52:58,676 --> 00:53:01,043
Okay, try zero-zero-zero-zero.

873
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,332
Okay, now try one-two-three-four.

874
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:05,408
Now try four-three-two-one.

875
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,035
Try 1-800-OPEN.

876
00:53:07,059 --> 00:53:09,621
Aah! I don't know.
Chuck, what's your birthday?

877
00:53:09,645 --> 00:53:11,102
Nothing's working!

878
00:53:12,231 --> 00:53:13,917
Oh, no. Someone's coming.

879
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:14,977
Quick. Hide.

880
00:53:17,653 --> 00:53:18,653
Ouch.

881
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:24,094
<i>There's an eagle nearby.
There's an eagle nearby. There's an eagle near...</i>

882
00:53:24,118 --> 00:53:25,450
Shh, shh, shh.

883
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:30,100
You get started on the lockdown sequence.

884
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:32,207
I'm gonna hit the john.
Yes, sir.

885
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,204
We gotta get that key card.

886
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:54,805
Okay, Courtney, get that card.

887
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:00,852
There's something in the way.

888
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:04,773
Chuck, what's going on down there?

889
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:09,076
There's a divider in the way.

890
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:14,915
Maybe it's on the other side.

891
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:23,667
Okay, hold on.

892
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:37,472
Pretend to pee-pee.

893
00:54:54,458 --> 00:54:55,935
Oh, no. He's leaving.

894
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:57,291
Chuck, get that card.

895
00:54:58,337 --> 00:54:59,373
I got it.

896
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,508
Yeah, I'm just gonna...

897
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:27,568
Boop!

898
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:43,775
We're home!

899
00:55:43,799 --> 00:55:45,506
We're home, everybody.

900
00:55:54,476 --> 00:55:58,248
Oh, we missed you so much, Bird Island.

901
00:55:58,272 --> 00:55:59,683
"Bird Island"?

902
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:02,710
This is Piggy Island, sillies.

903
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:05,602
Bird Island is way over there.

904
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:15,807
We're in!

905
00:56:15,831 --> 00:56:18,949
Oh, my goodness gravy.

906
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:26,568
I want to see.

907
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:28,403
Chuck, hold on!
I want to see.

908
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:30,627
We don't have time for this.
You're stepping on my face.

909
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:35,636
Uh-oh.

910
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:52,927
What? What's happening?

911
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:55,489
I think he's challenging us
to a break-dance battle?

912
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,122
Oh, it's on!

913
00:57:14,056 --> 00:57:16,826
What's happening?
Looks like a little popping and locking.

914
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:17,886
A little what?

915
00:57:19,186 --> 00:57:20,802
Pop, pop, pop!

916
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:26,854
Hey, handsome.

917
00:57:27,486 --> 00:57:31,355
Hey.
Take those two and put them on ice.

918
00:57:32,741 --> 00:57:36,095
They've got Red and my sister. We've gotta go.
But the super-weapon.

919
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,972
That's my sister, mister.

920
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:40,975
And I'm gonna save her.
Chuck, slow down.

921
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:42,490
Slow down. Stop!

922
00:58:02,229 --> 00:58:03,640
Oh, yeah!

923
00:58:10,362 --> 00:58:11,398
Hmm?

924
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:14,238
Huh?

925
00:58:15,367 --> 00:58:16,367
Hey.

926
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:20,014
Hey. You done?

927
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:21,516
What happened?
Oh, let's see.

928
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:25,645
You got us captured and trapped in ice
on top of giant pool toys.

929
00:58:25,669 --> 00:58:26,729
Good job.

930
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:29,148
I just thought that maybe if I could...

931
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,067
Stop me?

932
00:58:31,091 --> 00:58:34,988
Yeah, you two lovebirds just thought
y'all could sail over here and stop me.

933
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:36,531
Lovebirds? No way.
Whoa. No, no, no.

934
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:39,993
I mean, we're barely, like, friend birds.
So typical.

935
00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:43,579
Type-A male paired with a strong female,

936
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:46,040
and you just can't stand it, can you?

937
00:58:46,064 --> 00:58:49,293
Well, I...
Let me guess. You prefer to fly solo.

938
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:52,171
I have to save everybody

939
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:54,173
all by myself!

940
00:58:54,197 --> 00:58:55,633
Just like a man.

941
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:58,177
Ooh. Ouch. That is kind of true though.

942
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:00,596
Maybe she was a little clingy at times.

943
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:04,559
Maybe she gave you that engagement ring
a little bit too early.

944
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:06,728
I don't think she's talking about us.

945
00:59:06,752 --> 00:59:09,605
Maybe she's talking about Mighty Eagle.

946
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:12,775
Debbie! Turn on the TV.
Yes.

947
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,277
Okay...

948
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:17,280
It's the one with the red button on top.
Okay...

949
00:59:17,304 --> 00:59:18,740
Red, Debbie.

950
00:59:18,764 --> 00:59:22,827
What I'm planning to do is take
these little-bitty, undeveloped islands

951
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:26,970
and turn them into my own personal paradise.

952
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:28,958
You're insane!

953
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:32,420
I am putting myself first.

954
00:59:32,444 --> 00:59:37,008
Because you know what?
I worked hard for it, and I deserve it.

955
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:39,740
All I gotta do is clear out
all these inhabitants.

956
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:42,847
You're a monster!
Ha-ha-ha!

957
00:59:42,871 --> 00:59:45,329
Glenn, show them what I'm talking about.
Uh-huh.

958
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:50,710
Excuse me? Are you getting smart
with me right now?

959
00:59:55,467 --> 01:00:00,007
I can't believe we're soaring
through the sky! Sky!

960
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:03,951
All thanks to our pig pals,
they are cool guys!

961
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:06,913
Guys!
No!

962
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:09,248
What the heck was that?

963
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:10,979
Piggy Island?!

964
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:17,236
Attention, everyone! It is imperative that
you all run for your lives!

965
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:24,931
Bird Island?!

966
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:26,662
My mommy and daddy.

967
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:29,333
Huh?

968
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:35,330
Terence? Where are the kids?
Hmm?

969
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,917
Where are the kids?!

970
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:44,972
I don't understand.
I thought Red was supposed to save us!

971
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:52,434
Oh, my gah...

972
01:00:55,527 --> 01:00:57,234
Huh. Oh, my gah.

973
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:02,176
Oh! Ha-ha-ha.

974
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,594
It actually worked.

975
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:04,699
Yes, yes, yes!

976
01:01:05,162 --> 01:01:08,121
Those islands are filled
with innocent birds and pigs!

977
01:01:08,832 --> 01:01:11,227
You all had the chance to evacuate.

978
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:14,835
But for some reason, you didn't.

979
01:01:15,964 --> 01:01:19,819
So you are 100 percent sure
we shouldn't evacuate?

980
01:01:19,843 --> 01:01:23,030
I am sure. No one needs to evacuate.

981
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:24,966
Everybody just stay calm.

982
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:28,119
Sorry. Ha-ha-ha.

983
01:01:28,143 --> 01:01:30,977
Not sorry. I'm truly not sorry.

984
01:01:41,156 --> 01:01:44,069
Whoo! Dodged that bullet.

985
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,241
Ha-ha!

986
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:22,798
This is all my fault.

987
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:24,759
Red, it's not your fault.

988
01:02:24,783 --> 01:02:28,179
No. It... It is my fault.

989
01:02:28,203 --> 01:02:30,616
I put myself before everyone else.

990
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:35,478
I was afraid if I wasn't a hero anymore,

991
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:36,709
they'd all stop...

992
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:39,398
They'd all stop liking me.

993
01:02:39,422 --> 01:02:45,446
Oh, Red. So you did all of this
because you were afraid of not being liked?

994
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:46,470
I...

995
01:02:47,783 --> 01:02:48,783
Yes.

996
01:02:48,807 --> 01:02:51,244
My fellow eagles,

997
01:02:51,268 --> 01:02:53,704
who's tired of living in an icy wasteland?

998
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:55,373
We are!

999
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:56,749
What is she doing?

1000
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:59,710
Who is tired of sipping hot chocolate

1001
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:01,600
and getting brain freeze?

1002
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:03,860
Aah! Me!

1003
01:03:07,325 --> 01:03:09,595
Who's tired of frozen dinners?

1004
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:11,472
Whoa, frozen dinners?

1005
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:13,099
Come on, Bomb, let's go.

1006
01:03:13,123 --> 01:03:17,959
Who's tired of playing only Vanilla Ice,
Ice-T and Ice Cube?

1007
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:19,772
I am.

1008
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:24,735
Who wants to live worry-free under
a beautiful tropical sun?

1009
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:27,405
Me! I want to be hot!

1010
01:03:27,429 --> 01:03:29,282
I want it hot!

1011
01:03:29,306 --> 01:03:30,783
There's no turning back!

1012
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:33,619
The future we deserve is about to be ours!

1013
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:35,871
Glenn! Activate the weapon!

1014
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:38,012
Start the countdown.

1015
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:40,689
<i>Ten minutes to launch.</i>

1016
01:03:51,536 --> 01:03:53,264
All right, stand back.

1017
01:03:53,288 --> 01:03:54,904
Wait, did you hear that too?
Bomb?

1018
01:03:58,460 --> 01:03:59,951
What in the...?

1019
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:03,649
Really, guys?
What? No. We weren't...

1020
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:05,359
Uh, yeah, they were.

1021
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:07,903
Guys, why is that clock counting backwards?

1022
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:10,531
We've only got 10 minutes.
It's now or never.

1023
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:13,242
Pig-kind and bird-kind are depending on us.

1024
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:15,244
What are we gonna do, Red?

1025
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:16,804
Well, I, uh...

1026
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:20,082
I think...

1027
01:04:20,106 --> 01:04:23,252
in times like these,
we need someone who can lead.

1028
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:25,171
We need a hero.

1029
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:27,812
You know what we need? We need Silver.

1030
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:29,281
Huh?

1031
01:04:31,326 --> 01:04:32,326
Oh.

1032
01:04:34,037 --> 01:04:35,903
Got any ideas?
I've got a few, actually.

1033
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:39,518
Okay.

1034
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:41,270
That's the heart of the super-weapon,

1035
01:04:41,294 --> 01:04:44,940
and if you look closely, you can see that
it's powered by air pressure.

1036
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:47,902
Moisture around a composite volcano
instantly vaporizes,

1037
01:04:47,926 --> 01:04:51,614
sending a plume of highly pressurized steam
to the surface.

1038
01:04:51,638 --> 01:04:54,533
That steam is contained
by the pressure chamber.

1039
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:56,786
And that's the part we need to destroy.

1040
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:59,914
Only problem is,
it's surrounded by armed guards.

1041
01:04:59,938 --> 01:05:03,000
Bomb. Do you think you can take out those guards?
Huh?

1042
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:04,627
Some of them look kind of tough.

1043
01:05:04,651 --> 01:05:07,421
It won't be easy.
Yeah, right. Of course. Got it.

1044
01:05:07,445 --> 01:05:11,133
Great. Chuck, I need you to disable
the security cameras.

1045
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:13,837
<i>There's a bunch of them, so you'll have to work fast.
Fast?</i>

1046
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:16,013
Don't even worry about it, sis.

1047
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:19,350
Red, you and I have to get inside one
of those ice balls.

1048
01:05:19,374 --> 01:05:21,268
Inside an ice ball?

1049
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:22,853
I... Sure. Okay.

1050
01:05:22,877 --> 01:05:27,566
Leonard, Courtney, Garry, do you see
that giant lever near the orange lava tube?

1051
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:30,277
Copy that.
I need you to pull it all the way down.

1052
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:33,280
That will create a ramp so that
when Red and I roll down in the ice ball,

1053
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:37,368
we'll be launched through the air
at the perfect trajectory to take out the super-weapon.

1054
01:05:37,392 --> 01:05:39,495
<i>Got it?
Now you're talking.</i>

1055
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:40,805
Great plan, Silver.
Great.

1056
01:05:40,937 --> 01:05:42,331
Mama would be so proud.

1057
01:05:42,355 --> 01:05:44,813
Okay, everyone put your wings and hooves in.

1058
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:49,443
Go, team!

1059
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:03,477
Chuck, let us know
when you've disabled the cameras.

1060
01:06:03,501 --> 01:06:05,367
Okay. On it.

1061
01:06:09,132 --> 01:06:10,998
Easy, boys.

1062
01:06:22,604 --> 01:06:23,604
Huh.

1063
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:29,503
Huh? Hey, Jerry.
Yeah?

1064
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:31,735
Come here. Look at this.
What's up?

1065
01:06:33,781 --> 01:06:36,865
Uh, it says everything's normal.

1066
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:44,894
Jerry, are you seeing this?

1067
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:48,355
Uh, I don't see anything.

1068
01:06:48,379 --> 01:06:49,982
No, not that one.

1069
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:51,292
Not over here.

1070
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:53,878

So why didn't you just team up with Chuck?
He's definitely faster than me.

1093

Nope, he's too light.

Why not Bomb, then?
You know, he's heavier than me.

01:08:20,555 --> 01:08:22,575
Too slow. You're perfect.

1096
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:26,138
Oh, that's funny.
I thought we weren't compatible.

1097
01:08:27,395 --> 01:08:29,164
Yeah. Um, well, you know...

1098
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:32,501
Some of the variables changed, so...

1099
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:33,857
Oh, variables, huh?

1100
01:08:34,819 --> 01:08:36,401
So, what are we doing here?

1101
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:40,690
We're on a mission.
Oh, yeah, the mission. Of course.

1102
01:08:41,034 --> 01:08:42,970
Okay, Bomb, we are in position.

1103
01:08:42,994 --> 01:08:45,139
Time to take out those guards.

1104
01:08:45,163 --> 01:08:46,404
Copy that.

1105
01:08:46,748 --> 01:08:49,491
Come on, Bomb, hold it together.
Tighten up. You can do this.

1106
01:08:53,463 --> 01:08:57,503
We got a 10-91G in the control room.
Roger that.

1107
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:02,965
Oh!

1108
01:09:04,724 --> 01:09:06,160
You can do this, Bomb.

1109
01:09:06,184 --> 01:09:09,018
Just take them out. Just take them out!

01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:09,684
I am over you, I'm over this place,

1252
01:17:09,708 --> 01:17:14,439
and I am ready to get that upgrade situation
going for me and my daughter.

in this icy wasteland.

1258
01:17:34,066 --> 01:17:39,381

1267
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:13,688
The hatchlings.

1268
01:18:13,981 --> 01:18:15,813
Oh, no! They're in trouble!

1269
01:18:27,661 --> 01:18:28,661
Jump!

1270
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:37,189
Everyone, run!
Run!

1271
01:18:37,213 --> 01:18:38,231
Let's go!

1272
01:18:38,255 --> 01:18:41,123
No, no, wait. This is not happening.

1273
01:18:48,265 --> 01:18:49,265
Gotcha!

1274
01:18:54,355 --> 01:18:56,688
I'm freaking out!
Me too!

1275
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:26,672
We did it.
We did it.

1276
01:19:28,157 --> 01:19:29,157
Debbie?

1277
01:19:29,181 --> 01:19:31,284
Where is she? Where's Debbie?

1278
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:32,765
Debbie?

1279
01:19:36,981 --> 01:19:38,438
Debbie, no.

1280
01:19:48,117 --> 01:19:49,949
What have I done?

1281
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:53,327
Oh, Debbie.

1282
01:20:02,131 --> 01:20:03,497
Are you okay?

1283
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:06,050
Sweetie?

1284
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:07,862
Honey pie?

1285
01:20:07,886 --> 01:20:10,003
Love of the last one minute of my life?

1286
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:14,349
Dad?

1287
01:20:14,768 --> 01:20:15,768
Yes.

1288
01:20:16,478 --> 01:20:18,999
You are so strong!

1289
01:20:19,023 --> 01:20:20,709
He saved my life!

1290
01:20:20,733 --> 01:20:22,269
Oh, Debbie.

1291
01:20:24,987 --> 01:20:27,299
Mom, can we keep him?

1292
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:28,508
Please?

1293
01:20:28,532 --> 01:20:30,802
Oh, I, uh...

1294
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:33,179
Mm.
Wait. Wait.

1295
01:20:33,203 --> 01:20:35,911
Before you answer, you should see something.

Uh...
Wait, wait, wait.

1297

Mm-hm.

1298
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:45,463

I've never been to a wedding before!

1307
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:16,639
Oh, okay, who's getting married again?

1308
01:21:16,663 --> 01:21:19,952
Oh, Terence, this is like our wedding
but expensive.

1309
01:21:21,085 --> 01:21:24,022
Flowers for you, flowers for you.

1310
01:21:24,046 --> 01:21:26,941
Flowers for you.
Ladies and gentlemen, birds and pigs,

1311
01:21:26,965 --> 01:21:31,029
we are gathered here today
because of these two characters.

1312
01:21:31,053 --> 01:21:34,449
Not only because they're being joined
in holy matrimony,

1313
01:21:34,473 --> 01:21:39,996
but also because one of them tried to destroy
our islands for her own selfish reasons.

1314
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:41,081
Guess who.

1315
01:21:41,105 --> 01:21:43,458
Oh, it's such a beautiful wedding.

1316
01:21:43,482 --> 01:21:44,834
It really is.

1317
01:21:44,858 --> 01:21:47,837
But Mighty Eagle swooped
in at the last second

1318
01:21:47,861 --> 01:21:50,298
and got all the credit for stopping her.

1319
01:21:50,322 --> 01:21:51,883
Yes, you did, baby.

1320
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:53,614
I love you.

1321
01:21:53,951 --> 01:21:55,136
Wrap it up.

1322
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:58,306
I now pronounce you eagle and husband.

1323
01:21:58,330 --> 01:22:01,038
You may now kiss the...
Come here, you.

1324
01:22:01,394 --> 01:22:02,394
Ugh.

1325
01:22:02,418 --> 01:22:05,730
All right. Get it, Mighty Eagle.
Oh, that is disgusting!

1326
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:08,024
Go, Zeta! Go, Dad!

1327
01:22:08,048 --> 01:22:09,442
Attention!

1328
01:22:09,466 --> 01:22:11,820
Attention, everybody. Eyes on me. Hi.

1329
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:13,154
Hi. Look up here.

1330
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:15,573
I would like to propose a toast

1331
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:18,806
to the bird who made all of this possible.

1332
01:22:19,977 --> 01:22:22,330
Our hero, Red.

1333
01:22:22,354 --> 01:22:24,332
Give it up for Red!
Yeah!

1334
01:22:24,356 --> 01:22:27,168
<i>Red! Red! Red!</i>

1335
01:22:27,192 --> 01:22:28,837
You're our hero, Red!

1336
01:22:28,861 --> 01:22:30,147
<i>Red! Red! Red!</i>

1337
01:22:30,696 --> 01:22:34,384
Oh! Uh, easy, guys. Hollow bones.
I've got hollow bones.

1338
01:22:34,408 --> 01:22:36,177
Who loves you, Red?
Yeah, Red!

1339
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:39,285
Uh, wow. I mean, thanks, guys.
I... Thank you.

1340
01:22:40,330 --> 01:22:42,447
Speech, speech, speech!

1341
01:22:48,839 --> 01:22:51,001
Looks like they still love you, Red.

1342
01:22:51,925 --> 01:22:55,613
Uh, oh...
Okay, well, you know, I'm, um...

1343
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:58,801
I'm honored, everybody.
Really, I... And I just, um...

1344
01:23:04,229 --> 01:23:07,459
Uh, two seconds. Give me two seconds. I'll be right back.
Whoo!

1345
01:23:07,483 --> 01:23:10,086
Good speech! Yeah!

1346
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:14,024
Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon me.
Excuse me. I'm just trying to squeeze through here.

1347
01:23:14,907 --> 01:23:16,990
Oh! Hey, hey, hey! Silver!
Huh?

1348
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:28,480
Wow, I, um... Thank you, guys.

1349
01:23:28,504 --> 01:23:31,357
Thank you for this.
And for all the support and love.

1350
01:23:31,381 --> 01:23:34,694
You know, it means, um...
Well, it means everything to me.

1351
01:23:34,718 --> 01:23:37,426
But, um, I don't deserve it.

1352
01:23:38,096 --> 01:23:39,324
She does.

1353
01:23:39,348 --> 01:23:40,617
What just happened?

1354
01:23:40,641 --> 01:23:42,928
Is that the nerd from our physics class?

1355
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:45,747
This is the real hero right here.

1356
01:23:45,771 --> 01:23:48,875
Silver is the one who came up
with the plan to stop the super-weapon

1357
01:23:48,899 --> 01:23:52,313
and ultimately saved all our lives.

1358
01:23:53,320 --> 01:23:56,716
Red, I didn't do this all on my own.

1359
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:59,323
Right. Because we're a team.

1360
01:24:00,827 --> 01:24:03,723
We couldn't have done anything
without Chuck and Bomb,

1361
01:24:03,747 --> 01:24:06,309
or Courtney and Garry.
Thank you.

1362
01:24:06,333 --> 01:24:07,310
Or Leonard.

1363
01:24:07,334 --> 01:24:10,855
Actually, we probably could've done it without Leonard.
Let's be honest, huh?

1364
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:13,942
Leonard's the man! I did everything!
I got the sub!

1365
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:15,944
And even Mighty Eagle.

1366
01:24:15,968 --> 01:24:17,070
So handsome.
Ethan!

1367
01:24:17,094 --> 01:24:21,213
And last, but certainly not least,
those adorable hatchlings.

1368
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:26,120
We are strongest when we all band together.

1369
01:24:26,144 --> 01:24:27,664
Just like Super String.

1370
01:24:27,688 --> 01:24:30,897
Let's hear it for Silver!
Yes!

1371
01:24:31,608 --> 01:24:33,628
I want to be an engineer.

1372
01:24:33,652 --> 01:24:36,381
All right! Yeah, Silver!
We love you, Silver!

1373
01:24:36,405 --> 01:24:38,567
Okay, Garry, now.
On it.

1374
01:24:41,535 --> 01:24:43,012
Oh, my gosh!

1375
01:24:43,036 --> 01:24:44,764
We're famous!
Wow. Look at that.

1376
01:24:44,788 --> 01:24:46,933
Oh, look! It's me!

1377
01:24:46,957 --> 01:24:49,727
You see, these guys are the real heroes.

1378
01:24:49,751 --> 01:24:53,085
They're the ones who deserve your love,
not me.

1379
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:57,318
We love you even more now, Red!

1380
01:24:57,342 --> 01:24:59,459
Yeah, Red! We love you!

1381
01:25:00,554 --> 01:25:03,157
See? You're not in this alone.

1382
01:25:03,181 --> 01:25:06,424
I'm married now.
Let's party, y'all! I's married!

1383
01:25:07,894 --> 01:25:09,385
Ha-ha-ha. Woo-hoo!

1384
01:25:14,735 --> 01:25:19,446
Debbie, get away from the punch bowl, girl!

Sarcastic?
Oh.

No way.
I see what you're doing.

Okay.
Maybe you can teach me sometime.

1399

Maybe I will, when you're not
too busy saving the world.

1400

Oh. You know, I actually just finished
doing that, so I'm pretty free.

Oh, no way. Because I'm pretty free too.

Well, I don't have anything to do either!

Wait a minute. What's that sound?

1404
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,222
Tickle Train?

1405
01:26:08,246 --> 01:26:10,933
Coming to Third Wheel Station!
Chuck, no!

Laugh it up, everybody. Ha-ha-ha.

1408
01:26:34,815 --> 01:26:37,168
No one can stop me.

1409
01:26:37,192 --> 01:26:39,796
I'll stop you, Zeta.

1410
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:41,047
Ha-ha-ha!

1411
01:26:41,071 --> 01:26:43,216
Well, you can't stop me from...

1412
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:47,178
showing you how cute my little sisters are
when they're sleeping.

1413
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:48,818
Yay!

1414
01:27:01,425 --> 01:27:03,569
They're so cute.

1415
01:27:03,593 --> 01:27:06,176
I kind of thought they'd be hatched by now.

1416
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:10,034
They're hatching!

1417
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:12,391
Yay!
Here they come!

1418
01:27:12,728 --> 01:27:14,685
Oh, my gosh! I see one!

1419
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:20,901
Mama!

1420
01:27:21,653 --> 01:27:23,815
Uh-oh.

1421
01:27:40,589 --> 01:27:42,125
Can I help you?

1422
01:27:44,259 --> 01:27:45,361
Oh.

1423
01:27:45,385 --> 01:27:46,626
Sorry.

1424

Mama?

1425
