1
00:02:16,118 --> 00:02:18,879
Is it possible that the water
has already killed them?

2
00:02:19,278 --> 00:02:21,159
Yes.

3
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:22,719
Then what?

4
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,599
If it doesn't work?

5
00:03:54,679 --> 00:03:56,118
Get them in the truck.

6
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,079
Get the hoses in! Start pumping!

7
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,679
Uh, I'm here to see
my husband, Vasily Ignatenko.

8
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,118
He's a firefighter from Chernobyl.
I have permission.

9
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:22,599
Chernobyl? I'm sorry, no visitors.

10
00:04:24,799 --> 00:04:27,118
Well, but Major...
Major Burov told me,

11
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,478
-he said...
-No exceptions.

12
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:31,239
Please. I've come all the way
from Kievskaya Oblast.

13
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,919
Excuse me.

14
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:00,599
Excuse me, excuse me.

15
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:01,919
Who are you? What are you doing here?

16
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:04,678
-I have a pass.
-You can't be here. It's not safe.

17
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,559
I am here to see my husband.

18
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,599
Vasily Ignatenko.

19
00:05:07,679 --> 00:05:09,119
He's a firefighter from Chernobyl.

20
00:05:09,198 --> 00:05:11,558
I know who Ignatenko is,
but you can't.

21
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:13,559
I have permission. I've...

22
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:22,599
You can see him for 30 minutes,
not a minute more.

23
00:05:22,679 --> 00:05:25,599
And you cannot touch him in any way.
Do you understand?

24
00:05:25,678 --> 00:05:27,839
-Yeah.
-Room 15.

25
00:05:29,518 --> 00:05:30,478
Thank you.

26
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,798
-You're not pregnant, are you?
-No.

27
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,998
I won't have
to give that to you.

28
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,078
There they are.

29
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:44,998
No, wait, wait, wait.
I haven't finished yet.

30
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:46,159
No, no, he hasn't.

31
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:48,199
Yeah, that's good.

32
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,158
Yeah, better.

33
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,599
Look who the cat dragged in.

34
00:05:59,118 --> 00:06:00,719
What did I tell you?

35
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:03,759
There's no hiding from you,
is there? Eh?

36
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,878
Easy, easy. It's okay.

37
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:12,119
We're all okay. Yeah, we're okay.

38
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:22,599
How, how, how did this happen?
Who gave them the idea?

39
00:07:22,678 --> 00:07:24,519
-Are you suggesting I did?
-Someone did.

40
00:07:24,598 --> 00:07:27,919
Someone decided
that the evacuation zone

41
00:07:27,998 --> 00:07:31,038
should be 30 kilometers,
when we know, here,

42
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:33,758
cesium-137 in the Gomel district.

43
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:36,398
-That's 200 kilometers away!
- It was decided.

44
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,278
-Based on what?
- I don't know!

45
00:07:39,678 --> 00:07:43,439
Forgive me. Maybe I... I've just
spent too much time in my lab.

46
00:07:43,518 --> 00:07:45,119
Or maybe I'm just stupid.

47
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:47,559
Is this really the way it all works?

48
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,439
An uninformed, arbitrary decision

49
00:07:50,518 --> 00:07:52,678
that will cost who knows
how many lives

50
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:56,479
made by some apparatchik?
Some career party man?

51
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,479
I'm a career party man.

52
00:08:01,399 --> 00:08:04,078
You should watch your tone,
Comrade Legasov.

53
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:06,278
Comrades...

54
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:09,838
We have visual confirmation
that the fire is nearly extinguished.

55
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,839
There has also been
a reduction in iodine-131

56
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:13,838
and cesium-137 emissions.

57
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,318
Good. Yes?

58
00:08:15,998 --> 00:08:18,719
But the temperature is rising.

59
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,118
And, uh...

60
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:29,838
There's a spike
in zirconium-95.

61
00:08:31,118 --> 00:08:34,199
It's from the cladding
on the fuel rods.

62
00:08:34,278 --> 00:08:36,519
Meaning what?

63
00:08:36,598 --> 00:08:38,879
The meltdown has begun.

64
00:09:15,918 --> 00:09:17,399
Get it off me!

65
00:09:19,918 --> 00:09:22,199
Get it off me!

66
00:09:29,398 --> 00:09:30,839
Stop moving!

67
00:09:30,918 --> 00:09:33,559
Get off him! You're hurting him!

68
00:09:34,358 --> 00:09:36,398
- You can't be in here.
- What's happening to him?

69
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:37,878
Get out!

70
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:39,638
You can't be in here!

71
00:10:20,838 --> 00:10:21,798
Yes?

72
00:10:21,878 --> 00:10:23,318
Comrade Shcherbina
is on the phone.

73
00:10:23,398 --> 00:10:24,719
Put him through.

74
00:10:26,119 --> 00:10:27,359
Well?

75
00:10:27,438 --> 00:10:29,078
The fire's nearly out.

76
00:10:29,158 --> 00:10:30,798
The bubbler tanks are being drained.

77
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:33,718
We have successfully eliminated
the risk of a thermal explosion.

78
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:37,759
And?

79
00:10:39,198 --> 00:10:40,759
The situation inside the core

80
00:10:40,838 --> 00:10:43,639
is deteriorating
faster than anticipated.

81
00:10:43,718 --> 00:10:46,438
The concrete pad will last
for six to eight weeks,

82
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:49,439
but after that, Legasov estimates
a 50% chance

83
00:10:49,518 --> 00:10:51,158
that the fuel will breach the pad

84
00:10:51,238 --> 00:10:53,838
and melt down
into the groundwater itself.

85
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:57,198
And where
does this groundwater go?

86
00:10:57,278 --> 00:10:59,238
The Pripyat River,

87
00:10:59,318 --> 00:11:02,118
which feeds into the Dnieper.

88
00:11:02,198 --> 00:11:05,438
The primary water supply for
approximately 50 million people,

89
00:11:05,518 --> 00:11:09,478
not to mention crops and livestock,
would be unusable.

90
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:12,158
We're recommending we install
a heat exchanger under the pad

91
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:15,199
to lower the core temperature
and halt the meltdown.

92
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:18,199
And in order to do that,
I'm told that we will need

93
00:11:20,438 --> 00:11:24,119
all of the liquid nitrogen
in the Soviet Union.

94
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:27,438
Oh.

95
00:11:28,478 --> 00:11:29,518
All right.

96
00:11:29,599 --> 00:11:31,119
Yeah, and of course,
we'll also need...

97
00:11:31,198 --> 00:11:32,438
Whatever you need, you have it.

98
00:11:32,518 --> 00:11:33,878
-That should be clear by now.
-Yes.

99
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,479
-Anything else?
-Uh, no, no, no. Thank you.

100
00:11:35,558 --> 00:11:38,478
Yes. I'd like to address
the 30-kilometer exclusion zone.

101
00:11:38,558 --> 00:11:41,198
Wait, what?
Professor Legasov, is that you?

102
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,479
What exclusion zone?

103
00:11:42,558 --> 00:11:44,518
Minor details, General Secretary.

104
00:11:44,598 --> 00:11:47,039
Um, Premier Ryzhkov
has determined that...

105
00:11:47,118 --> 00:11:49,398
If he determined, then he determined.

106
00:11:49,479 --> 00:11:50,838
Look, Professor Legasov,

107
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,758
you are there for one reason only.

108
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:54,839
Do you understand? To make this stop.

109
00:11:54,918 --> 00:11:56,079
I don't want questions.

110
00:11:56,158 --> 00:11:57,719
I want to know when this will be over.

111
00:11:58,119 --> 00:12:00,078
If you mean when will
Chernobyl be completely safe,

112
00:12:00,158 --> 00:12:03,199
the half-life of plutonium-239
is 24,000 years.

113
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:06,318
So perhaps we should just say,
"Not within our lifetimes."

114
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:19,878
I think you and I should take a walk.

115
00:12:20,398 --> 00:12:21,999
It's late. I'm tired.

116
00:12:23,038 --> 00:12:25,279
We're taking a walk.

117
00:12:31,478 --> 00:12:33,799
What is it you want? An apology?

118
00:12:35,518 --> 00:12:37,158
Not gonna sit back and...

119
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:40,998
What will happen to our boys?

120
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:44,199
Which boys? The divers?

121
00:12:44,278 --> 00:12:47,079
The divers, the firefighters,
the men in the control room.

122
00:12:47,758 --> 00:12:50,998
What does the radiation
do to them, precisely?

123
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:55,158
At the levels
some of them were exposed?

124
00:12:55,238 --> 00:12:58,238
Ionizing radiation tears
the cellular structure apart.

125
00:12:59,159 --> 00:13:01,878
The skin blisters,
turns red, then black.

126
00:13:03,478 --> 00:13:05,879
This is followed by a latency period.

127
00:13:07,038 --> 00:13:08,838
The immediate effects subside.

128
00:13:08,918 --> 00:13:10,598
The patient appears to be recovering.

129
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:14,038
Healthy, even. But they aren't.

130
00:13:15,598 --> 00:13:18,798
This usually only lasts
for a day or two.

131
00:13:21,198 --> 00:13:22,358
Continue.

132
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,398
Then the cellular damage
begins to manifest.

133
00:13:27,478 --> 00:13:32,678
The bone marrow dies,
the immune system fails,

134
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:36,278
the organs and soft tissue
begin to decompose.

135
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:40,238
The arteries and veins
spill open like sieves,

136
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,639
to the point where you can't
even administer morphine

137
00:13:42,718 --> 00:13:46,158
for the pain, which is unimaginable.

138
00:13:46,918 --> 00:13:50,039
And then three days
to three weeks, you're dead.

139
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:54,358
That is what will happen
to those boys.

140
00:13:56,598 --> 00:13:57,918
And what about us?

141
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:02,918
Well, we've...

142
00:14:02,998 --> 00:14:05,838
We've gotten a steady dose,
but not as much of it.

143
00:14:07,118 --> 00:14:08,878
Not strong enough to kill the cells,

144
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,878
but consistent enough
to damage our DNA.

145
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:15,918
So, in time, cancer.

146
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:19,558
Or a plastic anemia. Either way, fatal.

147
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:23,438
Well...

148
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:30,798
In a sense, it would seem we've
gotten off easy then, Valery.

149
00:14:42,998 --> 00:14:44,718
I've seen them before.

150
00:14:50,518 --> 00:14:53,679
Now you know
why I wanted to take a walk.

151
00:14:53,758 --> 00:14:55,918
We can presume
the work site is bugged.

152
00:14:56,878 --> 00:15:00,758
And our rooms, even our bathrooms.

153
00:15:00,838 --> 00:15:02,918
They've been here the whole time.

154
00:15:02,998 --> 00:15:04,918
Of course, they've been here
the whole time.

155
00:15:06,118 --> 00:15:09,838
But if we're seeing them
out in the open now,

156
00:15:09,918 --> 00:15:12,479
it's because they want us to know.

157
00:15:52,638 --> 00:15:53,759
You've seen that?

158
00:15:56,118 --> 00:15:58,078
The fuel is melting
faster than we expected.

159
00:15:58,158 --> 00:16:00,358
I know. I have a plan.

160
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:03,558
Heat exchanger, I hope.

161
00:16:03,638 --> 00:16:05,038
Yes.

162
00:16:08,118 --> 00:16:09,958
There's something I've wanted
to ask you, comrade,

163
00:16:10,038 --> 00:16:13,278
but I see you're already asking
yourself the same question.

164
00:16:16,878 --> 00:16:19,038
Why did it explode?

165
00:16:20,678 --> 00:16:22,878
I've worked the numbers over and over,

166
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:26,398
presuming the worst possible
conditions in an RBMK reactor.

167
00:16:28,318 --> 00:16:30,838
And I always get the same answer.

168
00:16:30,918 --> 00:16:32,278
Which is?

169
00:16:33,638 --> 00:16:34,758
It's not possible.

170
00:16:35,918 --> 00:16:37,278
And yet...

171
00:16:40,238 --> 00:16:42,238
You're not going to solve this here.

172
00:16:43,838 --> 00:16:45,278
Not on paper.

173
00:16:46,918 --> 00:16:48,638
Everyone who was in the control room,

174
00:16:48,718 --> 00:16:50,998
Dyatlov, Akimov, Toptunov,

175
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:54,438
they're all in Moscow,
Hospital Number 6.

176
00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:58,238
We need to find out exactly
what happened that night,

177
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:01,638
moment by moment,
decision by decision.

178
00:17:02,998 --> 00:17:04,918
Go now while they're still alive.

179
00:17:04,998 --> 00:17:07,118
Talk to them.

180
00:17:07,198 --> 00:17:09,678
Because if we don't find out
how this happened,

181
00:17:09,758 --> 00:17:11,958
it will happen again.

182
00:17:14,838 --> 00:17:16,478
And, Khomyuk...

183
00:17:17,998 --> 00:17:19,558
Be careful.

184
00:17:43,118 --> 00:17:44,598
Well, fuck you!

185
00:17:47,438 --> 00:17:49,318
Hey, here's one, here's one.

186
00:17:49,398 --> 00:17:51,238
What's as big as a house,

187
00:17:51,318 --> 00:17:54,238
burns 20 liters of fuel every hour,

188
00:17:54,318 --> 00:17:56,078
puts out a shit-load of smoke
and noise,

189
00:17:57,238 --> 00:17:59,398
and cuts an apple into three pieces?

190
00:18:01,838 --> 00:18:05,158
A Soviet machine made to cut
apples into four pieces!

191
00:18:42,878 --> 00:18:45,238
- Who's in charge here?
- I'm the crew chief.

192
00:18:46,837 --> 00:18:49,918
I am Shadov,
Minister of Coal Industries.

193
00:18:49,997 --> 00:18:51,238
We know who you are.

194
00:18:53,358 --> 00:18:54,958
How many men do you have?

195
00:18:55,518 --> 00:18:58,878
On this shift, 45 here,
a hundred in total.

196
00:18:59,758 --> 00:19:02,598
I need all 100 men to gather
their equipment and get in the trucks.

197
00:19:03,798 --> 00:19:06,118
Do you? To where?

198
00:19:07,798 --> 00:19:08,958
That's classified.

199
00:19:15,398 --> 00:19:16,518
Come on, then.

200
00:19:17,078 --> 00:19:18,278
Start shooting.

201
00:19:18,718 --> 00:19:21,318
You haven't got enough
bullets for all of us.

202
00:19:21,397 --> 00:19:23,478
Kill as many as you can,
whoever's left,

203
00:19:23,798 --> 00:19:25,358
they'll beat the living piss
out of each of you.

204
00:19:25,438 --> 00:19:27,598
-You can't talk to us like that!
-Shut the fuck up!

205
00:19:28,718 --> 00:19:31,118
This is Tula. This is our mine.

206
00:19:32,118 --> 00:19:33,838
We don't leave unless we know why.

207
00:19:35,797 --> 00:19:36,838
Mmm.

208
00:19:40,838 --> 00:19:42,758
You're going to Chernobyl.

209
00:19:44,798 --> 00:19:46,318
Do you know what's happened there?

210
00:19:47,398 --> 00:19:49,318
We dig up coal, not bodies.

211
00:19:50,438 --> 00:19:52,638
The reactor fuel is going
to sink into the ground

212
00:19:52,718 --> 00:19:55,518
and poison the water
from Kiev to the Black Sea.

213
00:19:55,598 --> 00:19:56,878
All of it.

214
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,397
Forever, they say.

215
00:20:01,438 --> 00:20:03,878
They want you
to stop that from happening.

216
00:20:05,198 --> 00:20:07,278
And how are we supposed to do that?

217
00:20:08,078 --> 00:20:10,598
They didn't tell me,
because I don't need to know.

218
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:14,878
Do you need to know,
or have you heard enough?

219
00:20:54,438 --> 00:20:57,118
Now you look like
the Minister of Coal.

220
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:19,158
Vasya?

221
00:21:20,638 --> 00:21:21,837
Vasya?

222
00:21:27,678 --> 00:21:28,838
No, no, no.

223
00:21:29,798 --> 00:21:31,557
They told you no touching.

224
00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:34,198
It's not safe.

225
00:21:34,278 --> 00:21:36,438
They touch you.

226
00:21:37,478 --> 00:21:39,318
If it's safe for them,
it's safe for me.

227
00:21:48,997 --> 00:21:50,757
Where are the others?

228
00:21:50,838 --> 00:21:52,598
They took them to a special room.

229
00:21:54,197 --> 00:21:55,758
They won't tell me where.

230
00:21:59,878 --> 00:22:00,958
Will you open the curtains?

231
00:22:02,398 --> 00:22:03,358
Hmm?

232
00:22:03,637 --> 00:22:04,958
Open the curtains.

233
00:22:08,877 --> 00:22:09,837
Ah.

234
00:22:26,677 --> 00:22:28,757
Please, tell me what you see outside.

235
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:31,237
Tell me everything.

236
00:22:38,438 --> 00:22:39,398
Um...

237
00:22:41,117 --> 00:22:42,997
I can see the Red Square.

238
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:47,038
And

239
00:22:47,878 --> 00:22:49,597
the Kremlin.

240
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:53,878
Spasskaya Tower, the mausoleum.

241
00:22:56,238 --> 00:22:57,837
You see St. Basil's?

242
00:22:59,398 --> 00:23:00,837
Yeah.

243
00:23:00,918 --> 00:23:02,558
Ah.

244
00:23:02,838 --> 00:23:04,478
Yes, it's beautiful.

245
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:07,837
I told you.

246
00:23:07,918 --> 00:23:10,558
I told you I'd show you Moscow,
didn't 1?

247
00:23:10,758 --> 00:23:11,797
Huh?

248
00:23:11,878 --> 00:23:13,798
Yeah. Yes.

249
00:23:19,517 --> 00:23:21,238
Thank you.

250
00:24:06,598 --> 00:24:09,157
I'm not eating that. It's shit.

251
00:24:09,957 --> 00:24:11,118
Get me something else.

252
00:24:12,437 --> 00:24:14,797
I'm not a nurse, Comrade Dyatlov.

253
00:24:14,878 --> 00:24:16,638
I'm a nuclear physicist.

254
00:24:17,558 --> 00:24:19,878
Well, then, Comrade Nuclear Physicist,

255
00:24:21,357 --> 00:24:25,678
unless you happen to have
a butter and caviar sandwich on you,

256
00:24:25,757 --> 00:24:27,998
you can get the fuck out of my room.

257
00:25:43,677 --> 00:25:44,877
What?

258
00:25:45,918 --> 00:25:47,438
I'm not good at this, Boris.

259
00:25:48,437 --> 00:25:50,197
The lying.

260
00:25:54,438 --> 00:25:56,837
Have you ever spent time with miners?

261
00:25:58,678 --> 00:25:59,957
No.

262
00:26:00,117 --> 00:26:02,638
My advice, tell the truth.

263
00:26:02,717 --> 00:26:05,958
These men work in the dark.
They see everything.

264
00:26:07,397 --> 00:26:09,638
Andrei Glukhov, crew chief.

265
00:26:24,598 --> 00:26:25,717
Do these work?

266
00:26:27,437 --> 00:26:28,917
To an extent.

267
00:26:32,077 --> 00:26:33,037
Of course.

268
00:26:44,717 --> 00:26:46,118
So what's the job?

269
00:26:48,038 --> 00:26:51,598
We need to install a liquid
nitrogen heat exchanger

270
00:26:51,677 --> 00:26:54,758
underneath this concrete pad.

271
00:26:54,837 --> 00:26:58,357
There's no way to approach
from the interior of the building,

272
00:26:58,438 --> 00:27:00,678
so you have to get at it
from underground.

273
00:27:00,757 --> 00:27:04,078
-And what's above the pad?
-The core of the nuclear reactor,

274
00:27:04,157 --> 00:27:06,398
which is melting down.

275
00:27:07,837 --> 00:27:09,438
What? Like...

276
00:27:11,078 --> 00:27:12,158
Essentially.

277
00:27:14,078 --> 00:27:15,358
Is it gonna fall on top of us?

278
00:27:15,437 --> 00:27:17,157
Not if you're done within six weeks.

279
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:20,917
Dimensions?

280
00:27:23,838 --> 00:27:25,717
Break ground here,

281
00:27:25,797 --> 00:27:28,078
dig a tunnel 150 meters to here,

282
00:27:28,157 --> 00:27:30,997
excavate a space 30 by 30 meters

283
00:27:31,077 --> 00:27:32,797
for the heat exchanger.

284
00:27:32,878 --> 00:27:35,837
And because we need to keep disruption
of the ground above to a minimum,

285
00:27:35,918 --> 00:27:37,637
you can't use any heavy machinery.

286
00:27:37,717 --> 00:27:39,078
It has to be done by hand.

287
00:27:39,878 --> 00:27:41,717
Gonna need more men.

288
00:27:42,758 --> 00:27:44,077
Four hundred at least.

289
00:27:44,158 --> 00:27:46,598
We'll have to work around the clock.

290
00:27:46,677 --> 00:27:48,357
How deep do you want this tunnel?
Six meters?

291
00:27:48,437 --> 00:27:51,357
-Twelve.
-Twelve? Why?

292
00:27:51,558 --> 00:27:53,917
For your protection.

293
00:27:53,998 --> 00:27:57,718
At that depth, you'll be shielded
from much of the radiation.

294
00:27:58,518 --> 00:28:01,678
The entrance to the tunnel
won't be 12 meters below ground.

295
00:28:02,918 --> 00:28:04,718
No.

296
00:28:04,797 --> 00:28:07,557
And we're not 12 meters
below ground now.

297
00:28:12,077 --> 00:28:14,838
No. We're not.

298
00:28:17,637 --> 00:28:19,597
We have
some equipment here on site.

299
00:28:20,597 --> 00:28:22,558
More will arrive by midnight.

300
00:28:24,038 --> 00:28:25,357
You can start in the morning.

301
00:28:25,438 --> 00:28:27,237
No. We start now.

302
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:31,637
I don't want my men here
one more second than they need to be.

303
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:36,157
If these worked,
you'd be wearing them.

304
00:28:45,917 --> 00:28:47,397
Are they all like that?

305
00:28:48,198 --> 00:28:49,838
They're all like that.

306
00:30:10,157 --> 00:30:11,117
Yes?

307
00:30:11,757 --> 00:30:12,877
What's it up to?

308
00:30:12,958 --> 00:30:14,197
Uh, 50 degrees.

309
00:30:17,997 --> 00:30:18,957
Fuck!

310
00:30:23,317 --> 00:30:24,357
Hey!

311
00:30:25,517 --> 00:30:26,557
Hey, you!

312
00:30:35,718 --> 00:30:37,078
We need fans.

313
00:30:37,157 --> 00:30:38,677
For what purpose?

314
00:30:38,998 --> 00:30:40,437
What do you mean, "For what purpose?"

315
00:30:40,518 --> 00:30:42,237
To dig your fucking tunnel,
that's why.

316
00:30:42,317 --> 00:30:44,037
-Who's talking to you?
-Whoa, whoa. Comrades.

317
00:30:45,318 --> 00:30:46,678
It's 50 degrees down there.

318
00:30:47,597 --> 00:30:50,518
We can't breathe without the masks,
we can't breathe with the masks.

319
00:30:50,597 --> 00:30:53,357
It's like a fucking oven.
We need ventilation.

320
00:30:53,437 --> 00:30:56,237
Fans will put dust in the air,
the dust will go in your lungs.

321
00:30:56,317 --> 00:30:58,717
I've been breathing dust
in my lungs for 20 years.

322
00:30:58,797 --> 00:31:01,477
Not this dust. I'm sorry.

323
00:31:01,557 --> 00:31:03,838
For your own good, no fans.

324
00:31:31,597 --> 00:31:33,837
My name is Ulana Khomyuk.

325
00:31:33,917 --> 00:31:36,637
I'm a nuclear physicist
with the Chernobyl Commission.

326
00:31:38,837 --> 00:31:41,197
I want you to tell me
everything that happened

327
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:42,437
on the night of the accident.

328
00:31:44,077 --> 00:31:45,197
Is that all right?

329
00:31:48,077 --> 00:31:49,077
Yes.

330
00:31:51,317 --> 00:31:52,477
I want to tell.

331
00:31:53,637 --> 00:31:54,637
All right.

332
00:32:07,437 --> 00:32:09,677
Your official title was?

333
00:32:12,757 --> 00:32:17,517
My name is Leonid Fedorovych Toptunov.

334
00:32:18,397 --> 00:32:23,437
I am the Senior Reactor Control
Chief Engineer

335
00:32:23,518 --> 00:32:25,438
at Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant.

336
00:32:29,357 --> 00:32:31,198
Senior engineer?

337
00:32:33,437 --> 00:32:34,477
How old are you?

338
00:32:39,957 --> 00:32:41,277
I'm 25.

339
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,717
Lyusya? Lyusya?

340
00:33:29,797 --> 00:33:31,957
Yes, I'm here, I'm here. I'm...

341
00:33:46,277 --> 00:33:47,637
Have you been here this whole time?

342
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:49,677
No one said I should leave.

343
00:33:50,557 --> 00:33:51,557
I did.

344
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,437
Thirty minutes, I said!

345
00:33:53,517 --> 00:33:56,357
Well, where have you been?
When he's in pain?

346
00:33:56,917 --> 00:33:58,397
When his sores stick to his gown?

347
00:33:58,477 --> 00:33:59,837
When he soils himself
five times a night?

348
00:33:59,917 --> 00:34:01,677
I've been looking after him.
Where have you been?

349
00:34:01,757 --> 00:34:03,397
I've been in the north and west wing,

350
00:34:03,477 --> 00:34:06,237
where there are dozens of patients
from Chernobyl exactly like him.

351
00:34:06,957 --> 00:34:08,477
- It isn't safe for you here.
-He's my husband.

352
00:34:08,557 --> 00:34:09,557
Not anymore.

353
00:34:09,637 --> 00:34:11,517
He's something else now.
Do you understand?

354
00:34:11,597 --> 00:34:12,837
He's dangerous to you.

355
00:34:14,077 --> 00:34:16,037
He's burned.

356
00:34:16,717 --> 00:34:17,997
Go home.

357
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:19,957
Please.

358
00:34:23,357 --> 00:34:25,517
It won't take much longer. I, uh...

359
00:34:29,477 --> 00:34:31,037
I don't want him to die alone.

360
00:34:34,637 --> 00:34:36,237
Stay on the other side of the plastic,

361
00:34:38,277 --> 00:34:39,677
or I'll have you removed by security.

362
00:35:36,756 --> 00:35:38,317
- Lyusya?
- Yes, my love.

363
00:35:42,077 --> 00:35:43,117
Is It day”?

364
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,437
No, it's nighttime now.

365
00:35:50,397 --> 00:35:51,677
I think I had a dream,

366
00:35:52,237 --> 00:35:53,597
it's just gone.

367
00:35:55,797 --> 00:35:56,916
Vasya.

368
00:36:02,757 --> 00:36:04,397
We're going to have a baby.

369
00:36:39,917 --> 00:36:41,037
The fire's out.

370
00:36:43,637 --> 00:36:44,796
It's out, Valera.

371
00:36:46,436 --> 00:36:48,557
The miners are making
incredible progress.

372
00:36:49,996 --> 00:36:52,717
They say the whole job
will be finished in four weeks.

373
00:36:54,396 --> 00:36:55,356
Four weeks.

374
00:36:56,637 --> 00:36:57,676
Can you believe that?

375
00:37:04,157 --> 00:37:05,636
I know the job isn't over.

376
00:37:07,677 --> 00:37:09,157
But it's the beginning of the end.

377
00:37:14,997 --> 00:37:17,237
I'm sorry to bother you,
Deputy Minister,

378
00:37:19,756 --> 00:37:20,716
but it is the miners.

379
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:08,077
What?

380
00:38:08,517 --> 00:38:10,717
You wouldn't give us fans,
it's too hot for clothes.

381
00:38:11,077 --> 00:38:13,396
So we're digging the old way.
This is the way our fathers mined.

382
00:38:15,957 --> 00:38:17,356
We're still wearing the fucking hats.

383
00:38:18,277 --> 00:38:19,317
What do you want?

384
00:38:22,316 --> 00:38:24,397
You're not as protected now.

385
00:38:25,117 --> 00:38:26,597
Are you telling me
it will make a difference?

386
00:38:32,397 --> 00:38:33,556
When this is over,

387
00:38:34,557 --> 00:38:35,717
will they be looked after?

388
00:38:39,837 --> 00:38:40,836
I don't know.

389
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:52,957
You don't know.

390
00:39:11,757 --> 00:39:15,717
So the power level jumped
from 200 to 400 megawatts?

391
00:39:17,277 --> 00:39:18,276
Yes.

392
00:39:19,317 --> 00:39:20,397
Very fast.

393
00:39:22,116 --> 00:39:24,996
Why didn't you initiate
an emergency shutdown?

394
00:39:25,516 --> 00:39:27,716
Why didn't you press the AZ-5 button?

395
00:39:29,477 --> 00:39:30,437
We did.

396
00:39:31,637 --> 00:39:34,357
I reported the increase to Akimov,

397
00:39:34,436 --> 00:39:35,836
and he pressed the button.

398
00:39:37,437 --> 00:39:39,717
Leonid, that's... That's not possible.

399
00:39:41,876 --> 00:39:42,877
He did.

400
00:39:43,877 --> 00:39:45,077
I swear.

401
00:39:46,077 --> 00:39:47,437
I saw him do it.

402
00:39:51,196 --> 00:39:53,197
And that's when it exploded.

403
00:39:55,917 --> 00:39:56,877
What?

404
00:40:10,957 --> 00:40:11,917
Um...

405
00:40:13,197 --> 00:40:14,557
Which room is Akimov?

406
00:40:14,636 --> 00:40:15,596
Twenty-seven.

407
00:40:30,276 --> 00:40:33,517
I pressed it,
before the explosion.

408
00:40:33,996 --> 00:40:35,117
Before.

409
00:40:37,997 --> 00:40:39,237
But why?

410
00:40:40,436 --> 00:40:41,636
Why would that happen?

411
00:40:43,757 --> 00:40:46,517
I shut it down. I pressed AZ-5.

412
00:40:52,557 --> 00:40:53,917
Thank you, Comrade Akimov.

413
00:40:59,037 --> 00:41:00,477
I did everything right.

414
00:41:02,437 --> 00:41:03,797
I did everything right.

415
00:41:34,036 --> 00:41:35,037
Get out.

416
00:41:35,836 --> 00:41:37,076
Get out. Get out of here.

417
00:41:37,157 --> 00:41:39,396
Let me go! Let me go!

418
00:41:39,477 --> 00:41:41,677
Stop it! Stop it!

419
00:41:44,797 --> 00:41:47,316
You let her in that room?
Inside the plastic, touching him?

420
00:41:47,397 --> 00:41:48,716
Did you know she's pregnant?

421
00:41:48,797 --> 00:41:49,917
It's not true!

422
00:41:49,997 --> 00:41:51,156
What have you done?

423
00:41:51,237 --> 00:41:53,396
What kind of a place is this?
Where is her protection?

424
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:55,517
Do you have any idea
what you're dealing with?

425
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,317
-Of course, I do. Please, I do not...
-No.

426
00:41:58,156 --> 00:41:59,676
-People are going to hear about this.
-Wait.

427
00:42:00,076 --> 00:42:01,756
People are going to hear.
Do you understand?

428
00:42:01,837 --> 00:42:02,836
Everyone is going to hear.

429
00:42:03,636 --> 00:42:05,077
What is everyone gonna hear?

430
00:42:11,596 --> 00:42:13,516
I am with the official
Chernobyl Commission.

431
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:15,716
I've been authorized
by Valery Legasov.

432
00:42:15,917 --> 00:42:16,877
You can check this.

433
00:42:16,956 --> 00:42:18,397
-My name is Ulana...
-We know who you are.

434
00:42:21,796 --> 00:42:23,316
What is everyone gonna hear?

435
00:42:43,836 --> 00:42:44,916
You have your notes?

436
00:42:45,636 --> 00:42:46,677
Yes.

437
00:42:49,517 --> 00:42:51,156
Khomyuk was arrested last night.

438
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:53,397
What? Why?

439
00:42:53,476 --> 00:42:54,597
I don't know.

440
00:42:56,277 --> 00:42:57,316
Was it...

441
00:42:58,356 --> 00:42:59,316
Of course it was.

442
00:43:01,116 --> 00:43:02,157
I'm working on it.

443
00:43:02,756 --> 00:43:04,757
-Boris...
-I'm working on it.

444
00:43:06,117 --> 00:43:07,237
What more do you want from me?

445
00:43:08,197 --> 00:43:09,196
Fix your tie.

446
00:43:15,956 --> 00:43:17,076
They'll see you now.

447
00:43:27,076 --> 00:43:30,236
After thousands of sorties,
our brave helicopter crews

448
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:32,436
successfully extinguished the fire.

449
00:43:32,516 --> 00:43:34,277
The miners are working
heroically to ensure

450
00:43:34,356 --> 00:43:36,717
that the fuel does not
reach the groundwater.

451
00:43:36,796 --> 00:43:40,356
And furthermore, there's no longer
a threat of additional explosion.

452
00:43:41,036 --> 00:43:44,677
The Soviet people have faced
the challenge and risen to the task,

453
00:43:45,036 --> 00:43:47,356
and they and everyone in this room
are to be commended.

454
00:43:52,556 --> 00:43:54,916
Lastly, Professor Legasov
and I have been vigilant

455
00:43:54,996 --> 00:43:57,236
to protect the security
interests of the State.

456
00:43:57,557 --> 00:43:59,876
And since the unfortunate
release of information

457
00:43:59,956 --> 00:44:01,636
directly following the accident,

458
00:44:01,716 --> 00:44:03,676
we believe that there
has been no further lapse.

459
00:44:04,196 --> 00:44:05,397
Comrade Charkov,

460
00:44:06,836 --> 00:44:09,996
we hope we have lived up to
the highest standards of the KGB.

461
00:44:10,396 --> 00:44:11,437
You have.

462
00:44:12,196 --> 00:44:13,197
Thank you.

463
00:44:14,516 --> 00:44:18,876
Professor Legasov will now speak
about the work that remains.

464
00:44:20,796 --> 00:44:21,876
Thank you.

465
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:28,676
Deputy Chairman Shcherbina
has given you the good news,

466
00:44:28,756 --> 00:44:29,996
and it is good.

467
00:44:30,757 --> 00:44:32,796
The immediate danger is over.

468
00:44:33,357 --> 00:44:35,557
Now, I'm afraid,
a long war must begin.

469
00:44:37,676 --> 00:44:40,517
There is an enormous amount
of radioactive debris

470
00:44:40,596 --> 00:44:42,236
and contamination spread out
across a zone

471
00:44:42,316 --> 00:44:44,676
of approximately
2,600-square kilometers.

472
00:44:44,956 --> 00:44:48,796
This entire region must be
completely evacuated.

473
00:44:50,196 --> 00:44:53,277
We must go to every town,
every village to ensure this.

474
00:44:54,516 --> 00:44:59,277
And all animals still
surviving within the zone,

475
00:44:59,356 --> 00:45:01,996
whether domesticated or wild,

476
00:45:02,076 --> 00:45:06,316
must be presumed contaminated
and will have to be destroyed

477
00:45:06,396 --> 00:45:08,956
to prevent the spread
of radiation and disease.

478
00:45:10,277 --> 00:45:12,796
In the immediate area
surrounding Chernobyl,

479
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:18,116
uh, every rock, every tree,
the very ground itself,

480
00:45:18,196 --> 00:45:21,676
has absorbed a dangerous
amount of radionuclides,

481
00:45:21,756 --> 00:45:24,996
which will be carried by the wind
and the rain if left exposed.

482
00:45:25,077 --> 00:45:27,156
So we will have to raze
entire forests.

483
00:45:27,236 --> 00:45:29,356
We will have to rip up
the top layer of earth

484
00:45:29,436 --> 00:45:30,796
and bury it under itself,

485
00:45:30,876 --> 00:45:33,717
approximately, 100 square kilometers.

486
00:45:35,917 --> 00:45:39,357
Um, and finally,
we will need to construct

487
00:45:39,436 --> 00:45:43,597
a containment structure
around the power plant itself,

488
00:45:43,676 --> 00:45:46,477
which will, of course,
still be extremely...

489
00:45:49,757 --> 00:45:51,436
There will be deaths.

490
00:45:54,956 --> 00:45:56,637
What amount of time,

491
00:45:56,716 --> 00:45:58,397
and how many men do you require?

492
00:45:58,476 --> 00:46:01,716
We expect this liquidation
effort to take three years

493
00:46:01,796 --> 00:46:04,276
and approximately 750,000 men,

494
00:46:04,356 --> 00:46:08,036
including a number of doctors
and structural engineers.

495
00:46:09,716 --> 00:46:10,956
How many deaths?

496
00:46:12,076 --> 00:46:13,276
Thousands.

497
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:15,397
Perhaps tens of thousands.

498
00:46:23,436 --> 00:46:24,396
Begin at once.

499
00:46:30,516 --> 00:46:32,396
<i>- Comrade Charkov.
- Valery!</i>

500
00:46:34,436 --> 00:46:35,476
Yes, Professor?

501
00:46:36,677 --> 00:46:39,436
My associate was arrested last night.

502
00:46:39,957 --> 00:46:40,917
Oh?

503
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:42,956
I mean no disrespect,

504
00:46:43,036 --> 00:46:44,916
but I was wondering
if you could tell me why.

505
00:46:44,996 --> 00:46:46,957
I assure you, I don't know
who you're talking about.

506
00:46:47,036 --> 00:46:48,877
She was arrested by the KGB.

507
00:46:49,996 --> 00:46:52,756
You are the first deputy
chairman of the KGB.

508
00:46:53,196 --> 00:46:54,156
I am.

509
00:46:54,516 --> 00:46:56,996
That's why I don't have to bother
with arresting people anymore.

510
00:46:57,076 --> 00:46:59,356
But you are bothering
with having us followed.

511
00:47:00,836 --> 00:47:03,436
I think the deputy chairman is busy.

512
00:47:03,516 --> 00:47:05,396
No, no. It's perfectly understandable.

513
00:47:05,716 --> 00:47:08,276
Comrade, I know you've heard
the stories about us.

514
00:47:09,317 --> 00:47:11,517
When I hear them, even I am shocked.

515
00:47:11,596 --> 00:47:13,476
But we are not what people say.

516
00:47:13,676 --> 00:47:15,676
Yes, people are following you.

517
00:47:16,317 --> 00:47:17,876
People are following those people.

518
00:47:18,756 --> 00:47:19,756
You see them?

519
00:47:22,197 --> 00:47:23,396
They follow me.

520
00:47:24,117 --> 00:47:27,396
The KGB is a circle of accountability.

521
00:47:27,716 --> 00:47:29,156
Nothing more.

522
00:47:29,316 --> 00:47:30,756
You know the work we're doing here.

523
00:47:32,796 --> 00:47:34,076
You really don't trust us?

524
00:47:34,156 --> 00:47:35,476
Of course, I do.

525
00:47:35,956 --> 00:47:37,756
But you know the old Russian proverb.

526
00:47:38,556 --> 00:47:39,956
“Trust but verify."

527
00:47:42,476 --> 00:47:45,876
And the Americans think that
Ronald Reagan thought that up.

528
00:47:45,956 --> 00:47:46,956
Can you imagine?

529
00:47:48,116 --> 00:47:49,676
It was very nice speaking with you.

530
00:47:50,916 --> 00:47:52,076
I need her.

531
00:47:54,676 --> 00:47:57,037
So you will be accountable for her?

532
00:48:01,476 --> 00:48:02,516
Then it's done.

533
00:48:03,956 --> 00:48:05,796
-Her name is...
- I know who she is.

534
00:48:06,836 --> 00:48:08,116
Good day, Professor.

535
00:48:17,996 --> 00:48:20,916
Well, that went surprisingly well.

536
00:48:21,716 --> 00:48:23,316
You came off like a naive idiot.

537
00:48:24,956 --> 00:48:27,116
And naive idiots are not a threat.

538
00:48:42,476 --> 00:48:44,357
I'll come back when
the paperwork's complete.

539
00:48:52,396 --> 00:48:53,476
Are you all right?

540
00:48:53,556 --> 00:48:54,716
They didn't hurt me.

541
00:48:56,876 --> 00:48:59,196
They let a pregnant woman
into a room with a...

542
00:48:59,356 --> 00:49:01,236
It doesn't matter.

543
00:49:02,476 --> 00:49:04,156
They were stupid. I was stupid.

544
00:49:06,396 --> 00:49:07,677
Dyatlov won't talk to me.

545
00:49:09,396 --> 00:49:11,636
Akimov, yes, Toptunov, yes, but...

546
00:49:13,756 --> 00:49:14,876
Valery,

547
00:49:15,436 --> 00:49:16,516
AKimov...

548
00:49:17,876 --> 00:49:19,116
His face was gone.

549
00:49:22,356 --> 00:49:23,516
You want to stop?

550
00:49:25,716 --> 00:49:27,396
Is that a choice I even have?

551
00:49:35,876 --> 00:49:38,916
Do you think the fuel will actually
melt through the concrete pad?

552
00:49:38,996 --> 00:49:42,076
I don't know. A 40% chance, maybe.

553
00:49:45,156 --> 00:49:46,956
I said 50.

554
00:49:47,916 --> 00:49:49,956
Either way, the numbers
mean the same thing.

555
00:49:50,036 --> 00:49:51,076
"Maybe."

556
00:49:54,236 --> 00:49:56,636
Maybe the core will melt
through to the groundwater.

557
00:49:57,556 --> 00:49:59,716
Maybe the miners who I've told
to dig under the reactor

558
00:49:59,796 --> 00:50:01,396
will save millions of lives.

559
00:50:03,276 --> 00:50:04,836
Maybe I'm killing them for nothing.

560
00:50:08,916 --> 00:50:10,516
I don't want to do this anymore.

561
00:50:12,396 --> 00:50:13,516
I want to stop.

562
00:50:15,476 --> 00:50:16,516
But I can't.

563
00:50:18,276 --> 00:50:20,636
I don't think you have
a choice any more than I do.

564
00:50:22,556 --> 00:50:25,236
I think, despite the stupidity,

565
00:50:25,836 --> 00:50:27,596
the lies, even this,

566
00:50:28,516 --> 00:50:29,756
you are compelled.

567
00:50:30,716 --> 00:50:32,996
The problem has been assigned,
and you will stop at nothing

568
00:50:33,076 --> 00:50:34,316
until you find an answer.

569
00:50:34,396 --> 00:50:36,916
Because that is who you are.

570
00:50:39,076 --> 00:50:40,316
A lunatic, then.

571
00:50:42,796 --> 00:50:43,756
A scientist.

572
00:51:05,116 --> 00:51:07,276
Did you know that they were
running a safety test?

573
00:51:09,076 --> 00:51:10,036
Yeah.

574
00:51:10,116 --> 00:51:11,196
There's something else.

575
00:51:12,996 --> 00:51:16,036
Akimov says
they shut the reactor down,

576
00:51:16,116 --> 00:51:17,956
and Toptunov confirms it.

577
00:51:18,596 --> 00:51:19,716
They pressed AZ-5.

578
00:51:19,996 --> 00:51:21,636
Apparently not soon enough.

579
00:51:22,116 --> 00:51:23,156
No.

580
00:51:23,756 --> 00:51:27,396
They say Akimov pressed AZ-5,

581
00:51:28,236 --> 00:51:30,116
and then the reactor exploded.

582
00:51:32,356 --> 00:51:34,996
If it had been just one of them,
I would have put it under

583
00:51:35,076 --> 00:51:37,836
faulty memory or delusion even,

584
00:51:37,916 --> 00:51:40,516
but they both agreed.
They were adamant.

585
00:51:44,956 --> 00:51:45,996
Comrade?

586
00:51:48,916 --> 00:51:49,956
Do you think it's possible?

587
00:51:50,036 --> 00:51:51,556
I think it makes no sense. I...

588
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:55,356
I think it's what I would say if
I was trying to cover my own mistakes.

589
00:51:55,955 --> 00:51:56,915
But?

590
00:51:58,116 --> 00:51:59,236
I believe them.

591
00:52:01,956 --> 00:52:03,316
Then you should pursue it.

592
00:52:03,915 --> 00:52:06,436
We have to pursue every possibility,

593
00:52:07,276 --> 00:52:09,036
no matter how unlikely,

594
00:52:09,836 --> 00:52:12,076
no matter what or who's to blame.

595
00:52:14,276 --> 00:52:17,396
I'll go back to the hospital
and re-interview Akimov and Toptunov.

596
00:52:20,756 --> 00:52:21,796
If they're still awake.

597
00:52:23,516 --> 00:52:24,516
They're not.

598
00:52:26,756 --> 00:52:27,716
Khomyuk.
