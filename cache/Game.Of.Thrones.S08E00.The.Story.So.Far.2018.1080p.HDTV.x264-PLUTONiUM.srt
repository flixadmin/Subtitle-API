00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:05,210
<i>Welcome to Westeros where
the fight for the kingdom is on.</i>

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,570
Anyone can die.

4
00:00:06,781 --> 00:00:10,590
<i>Where great families live
and die for the Iron Throne.</i>

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,980
- Dracarys!
- Your heart is in your mouth.

6
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,340
Those scenes are breathtaking.

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,580
- <i>Some are noble.</i>
- Jon Snow's everybody's hero.

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,540
- <i>Some are not.</i>
- Aarrgghh!

9
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:23,300
Aw, he's so bad!

10
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,910
- I have her!
- <i>So many kings and queens</i>

11
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:30,700
- <i>but only one can rule.</i>
- You cannot deny her strength.

12
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,040
Run!

13
00:00:32,051 --> 00:00:34,870
<i>The Wall is down and
the dead are coming.</i>

14
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,620
You can't have
a cliffhanger greater than that.

15
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,820
Oof! When's it start?

16
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,740
This is what Game Of Thrones does,
it sucks you in.

17
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,380
<i>So let's fly through
the saga to date</i>

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,820
<i>and get you ready for season eight.</i>

19
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,500
<i>As season one opens,
it's the calm before the storm.</i>

20
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,580
<i>King Robert Baratheon rules
from the capital King's Landing</i>

21
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,260
- <i>but his days are numbered.</i>
- To be king or queen in Westeros,

22
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,820
you sit on the
Iron Throne and you rule over

23
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,340
the Seven Kingdoms
from King's Landing.

24
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,540
Start the damn joust
before I piss myself!

25
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,460
<i>He's locked in a
loveless marriage and</i>

26
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,780
<i>only chose his queen for her family's
name to hold his kingdom together.</i>

27
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,260
On Robert's part,
there's no love involved.

28
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,260
Don't you get tired?

29
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,380
Every day.

30
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,860
It could've been anybody
and it happens to be Cersei.

31
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,580
I felt something
for you once you know.

32
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,500
- I'm very sympathetic to Cersei.
- I know.

33
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:43,060
She was completely in love with him.
She... she was in awe of him almost

34
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,580
and he turned into
this semi-abusive drunk.

35
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,140
Was it ever possible for us?
Was there ever a time,

36
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,180
ever a moment?

37
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,820
No.

38
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,260
You may think, initially,
'Oh, that poor

39
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:04,780
'lady married to that terrible
man.' But don't underestimate her.

40
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:10,140
<i>This unhappy couple have three
golden-haired children to their name</i>

41
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,740
<i>but Cersei keeps
a deadly secret from Robert.</i>

42
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,420
<i>The children are not his.</i>

43
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,660
<i>The truth will be discovered
on a royal trip north</i>

44
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,380
<i>and it's here that
our story really begins.</i>

45
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,500
<i>The king has asked his old ally
Ned Stark to help him rule.</i>

46
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,860
<i>Ned and his wife Catelyn
govern the North,</i>

47
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,900
<i>fiercely loyal to the crown.</i>

48
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:39,980
The Starks stand for loyalty,
integrity, bravery.

49
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,140
They are really
the moral compass of the show.

50
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,180
They're the good guys
and they're the ones

51
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,540
that you find yourself
rooting for from the start.

52
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:48,980
The couple have five children,

53
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,020
three sons and two daughters.

54
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,140
And the decimation
of this happy family

55
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,380
will reverberate
throughout our tale.

56
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,580
They're almost too
innocent for that world.

57
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,020
King Robert arrives
with his queen Cersei

58
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,060
and with them
is the whole Lannister clan.

59
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,940
That's Jaime Lannister,
the queen's twin brother.

60
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,300
Oh, the Lannisters. They're blond,

61
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:14,420
they're beautiful,
they're arrogant, so fuck them.

62
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,620
It's the Lannisters
who are going to introduce

63
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,900
a lot of trouble into the lives
of the Starks from this point.

64
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,300
King Robert has decided to ask
Ned to be the hand of the king.

65
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,980
Nine years I haven't seen you,

66
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,340
where have you been?
Guarding the North for you.

67
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,220
Robert realises that he... too late,
that he's surrounded himself

68
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,820
by enemies, really.

69
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,140
The only person he can trust is Ned.

70
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,780
I need you, Ned,
down at King's Landing

71
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,020
not up here where
you're no damn use to anybody.

72
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,260
More importantly, during the visit,
Bran Stark goes climbing

73
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,580
one day, gets to the
top of the tower and

74
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,380
discovers the Lannisters'
deep dark secret.

75
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,180
The secret is that
Cersei the queen

76
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,620
is actually sleeping
with her brother Jaime.

77
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,660
The Lannisters, oh, God!

78
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,180
Ugh! Oh!

79
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,540
Pffff! They are...

80
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,060
I have never seen a family...

81
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,060
I mean, talk about dysfunctional.

82
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,740
Oh!

83
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,580
Stop! Stop.

84
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,500
It's incest, which,
even in Westeros,

85
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,780
is generally frowned upon. It also
means that King Robert's children

86
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,260
are not actually his children.
It's all right.

87
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:26,140
He saw us!
I heard you the first time.

88
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,860
He knows what it means too
and he knows that if the incest

89
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,340
is discovered, not only will he
and his sister be put to death

90
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,980
but their three children
may very well too.

91
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:39,140
And so for Jaime Lannister,
the greatest swordsman in Westeros,

92
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,180
there's only one solution.

93
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,460
The things I do for love.

94
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,780
Here's a convenient way.
The kid will die,

95
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,740
it'll look like he fell
and our kids will be safe.

96
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,340
First in a coma,
Bran will later awake

97
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,180
with no memory of how
he fell or what he saw.

98
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,660
The royal secret is safe
for now and only the viewer

99
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,500
has seen what the
Lannisters will do to keep it.

100
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,980
Everything went
pear-shaped after that

101
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:10,780
and really that's the whole
chain of events starting.

102
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,020
King Robert still wants Ned
down in the capital,

103
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,820
so this will be the last ever
time we see the Stark family

104
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,620
all together, a family which
includes Ned's son out of wedlock,

105
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:24,420
the bastard Jon Snow.
Ned must now leave his family

106
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,460
and follow King Robert south,

107
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:29,220
taking his daughters
Sansa and Arya with him.

108
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,860
The reason I think the first
season of Game Of Thrones works

109
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,940
is it's essentially about this
good family that just wants to

110
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,540
essentially be left alone and serve
their king and their country.

111
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,100
The family is ripped apart and thrown
into situations they never anticipated.

112
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,300
<i>They are bound for the capital
King's Landing,</i>

113
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,660
<i>where Ned's new task
will be to protect King Robert</i>

114
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,700
<i>from those who would unseat him.</i>

115
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,820
<i>And in season one, viewers learned</i>

116
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,580
<i>the greatest enemies
live in exile overseas.</i>

117
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,140
<i>The Targaryens.</i>

118
00:05:58,211 --> 00:06:01,411
They were dethroned by
King Robert in the last war.

119
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,700
The only surviving members
of the family

120
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,340
are a brother and sister
called Viserys and Daenerys.

121
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,620
The siblings are the children of
the Mad King who was killed in war.

122
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,260
Viserys dominates
his younger sister.

123
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:17,580
Viserys has more than a touch
of the Targaryen madness

124
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,020
and, you know,
sometimes he's protecting her

125
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,420
but he's also trying to treat
her as a... as a bargaining chip.

126
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,060
Come forward, my dear.
In search of an army,

127
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,460
Viserys makes a pact with
a savage tribe, the Dothraki.

128
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:32,420
Offering his beautiful young
sister in marriage to their leader,

129
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,540
Khal Drogo. She's the only
bargaining chip he has,

130
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,540
he doesn't have any wealth any more,
he doesn't have any armies

131
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,140
but he has her who he
can trade to this horse lord.

132
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,780
I would let his
whole tribe fuck you,

133
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:50,700
all 40,000 men and their horses
too, if that's what it took.

134
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,300
He's power hungry
but to a nasty degree.

135
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,940
He doesn't really care
how or by what means,

136
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:01,700
he just wants to be
important and looked up to.

137
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,740
But his plans backfire.

138
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,500
Daenerys and Khal Drogo fall in love
and become quite the power couple.

139
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:13,780
Suddenly, she finds herself, with Khal
Drogo, empowered. People are obeying her.

140
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,580
Tell him I want what was bargained
for or I'm taking you back.

141
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,660
He completely underestimates
not only Dany but Khal Drogo.

142
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,900
What's he saying?

143
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,940
He says yes.

144
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,620
You shall have a golden crown.

145
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,380
It's a real coming-of-age story
throughout the first season.

146
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,220
She really grows into herself.

147
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,740
Look away, Khaleesi.
No.

148
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,860
This is one of the
turning points for Daenerys.

149
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,980
I think this is when you
realise that she's prepared

150
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,660
to sacrifice anything
for the greater good.

151
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,780
A crown for a king.

152
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,300
Aarrgghh!

153
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,940
Aaaarrrrgggghhhh!

154
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,420
Argh! Ugh! Ugh!

155
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,660
He was revolting.

156
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,140
He was utterly, utterly revolting.

157
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,180
And that was the moment that
she escaped from her shell.

158
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:16,580
When she became the woman
and not the kowtowed girl.

159
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,140
<i>And as the Targaryens grow in power,</i>

160
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,500
<i>we learn that King Robert
faces another challenge</i>

161
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,620
<i>to his northernmost borders.</i>

162
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,700
<i>Threats which led
past rulers to build</i>

163
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:28,980
<i>this giant wall of ice
to keep out wild things beyond.</i>

164
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,700
<i>It's protected by the
legendary Night's Watch.</i>

165
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,460
The Night's Watch are a small army

166
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,220
who guard the northern
border of the country.

167
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,660
In season one, there's lots
of fighting for the throne

168
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,820
but actually, in the background,
there are these creatures appearing

169
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:47,740
north of the Wall that nobody
has seen for thousands of years

170
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,100
and no-one wants to believe they're
there but they certainly are.

171
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,460
We hear the characters
saying that this is all folklore,

172
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,940
that this is all made up
but, for the viewer,

173
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,700
we see that, basically,
these characters do exist.

174
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,660
They are there.
Ugh!

175
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:11,620
The White Walkers
are terrifying mostly because

176
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,420
you're not 100% sure you know
what they're capable of doing

177
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,060
or what their motives are.

178
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,580
They are a serious threat.

179
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,260
In season one,
in search of a purpose,

180
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:25,860
Jon Snow ventures to the Wall
and joins the Night's Watch,

181
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,900
a leader in the making.

182
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,340
Jon Snow's everybody's hero.

183
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,620
Jon Snow's one of my favourite
characters. He's the dude.

184
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,300
He's also in search of answers.

185
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,860
The question of Jon...
Jon Snow's parentage

186
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,340
has been one of the
burning topics amongst,

187
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,460
not only the show's fans,
but book fans for many decades.

188
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,700
Jon Snow is Ned Stark's bastard son.
He brought him back from a war

189
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,780
and we never really
learned who the mother is.

190
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:55,180
Um, understandably,
Catelyn, Ned's wife,

191
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,220
isn't too fond of Jon
for that reason.

192
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:02,740
Try as she may, um,
she could never make peace

193
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:05,860
with that, with the fact
that Ned was unfaithful.

194
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,460
But down in the capital
King's Landing,

195
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:11,340
Ned Stark has a much
greater challenge to face.

196
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,100
His daughter has fallen
for Prince Joffrey.

197
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,260
She's presented with
marrying the future king,

198
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,300
live in a beautiful castle,
go to banquets,

199
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,420
have beautiful dresses to wear.
A fairy tale story.

200
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,620
Ned has discovered the queen
and her brother are lovers

201
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,340
and this will be
his family's undoing.

202
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,380
When the king returns from his hunt,
I'll tell him the truth.

203
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,340
You must be gone by then,
you and your children.

204
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,580
I will not have
their blood on my hands.

205
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:40,620
Before he gets the chance to talk to King Robert,
King Robert gets killed on a hunting trip.

206
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,740
Joffrey is now king and without
Robert to protect him,

207
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,220
Ned is tried for treason.
He confesses,

208
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,700
believing it will save his daughter
but misjudges the new ruler.

209
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:52,220
He's been stuck up
in the North too long

210
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,460
and has no idea how
the real world operates,

211
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,900
how to really deal with the
kind of... the politics of Westeros.

212
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,780
Bring me his head!

213
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,740
You will not!

214
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,700
That's when you realise nobody
is safe in this world at all.

215
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:12,660
No! Stop them!

216
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:16,660
When I saw Sean Bean pushed down...

217
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,060
...that was the only scene that
really has brought a tear to my eye.

218
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,340
It's cruel, it's heartbreaking,

219
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:30,700
but there's a point
to the children witnessing this.

220
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:34,900
If they want to survive,
they have to start to be resilient.

221
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,940
They have to learn from this.

222
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,260
It was at that moment, you realised
what Game Of Thrones was really about.

223
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:43,060
It's here that the
Stark family splinters.

224
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,460
Arya is whisked away by a Night's
Watch brother loyal to Ned,

225
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,340
leaving Sansa
at the mercy of Joffrey.

226
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,900
Robb Stark reacts
with murderous rage

227
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,420
to the news that his father
has been beheaded.

228
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:59,180
Robb's the heir and he's not only
picking up his father's mantle

229
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:02,940
as Lord of Winterfell but he's
picking up a much older mantle.

230
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,820
The crown that no-one has worn for
300 years, the Kingdom of the North.

231
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,100
It will lead to all-out war

232
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:12,140
between the Starks
and the Lannisters

233
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,540
who are led by its patriarch
Tywin Lannister.

234
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,620
Tywin Lannister is one
of the great warriors

235
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,980
and battle strategists of the age.

236
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:26,660
His legacy is uppermost
in his mind all of the time.

237
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,340
In these next few months,
we could establish a dynasty

238
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,380
that will last a thousand years.

239
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:35,100
Or we could collapse into nothing
like the Targaryens did.

240
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,500
All of his hopes are in Jaime.

241
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,420
As well as his twins,
Cersei and Jaime,

242
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:44,900
he has a son he despises,
Tyrion, known as the Imp.

243
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,860
You're wounded.
Good of you to notice.

244
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:52,620
Tyrion doesn't look like a warrior.
He doesn't look like a kingmaker,

245
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:56,860
there's no way that he can
assume the position of Tywin.

246
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:01,060
I hear we won. I would say Tyrion
is one of my favourite characters.

247
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:07,180
How he's managed to last
this long is amazing to me.

248
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:10,460
As war rages in Westeros,
over the Narrow Sea,

249
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:14,620
Daenerys loses a husband
but gains astonishing new powers.

250
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:17,220
She walks into
Khal Drogo's funeral pyre

251
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,460
with fossilised dragon's eggs.

252
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,700
Oh, what an epic scene.

253
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:29,540
Season one ends
with the sight of Daenerys

254
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,860
emerging from a fire unscathed
with her dragons hatched.

255
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,180
These creatures
are extraordinary creatures,

256
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:40,220
the likes of which have not
been seen in hundreds of years.

257
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,220
Blood of my blood.

258
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,020
You see these three dragons
around her and you're, just, like,

259
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,220
they're gonna be awesome
when they're grown.

260
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,060
The innocence is gone, she's it.

261
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,220
You know, she's the force now.

262
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:57,460
As the dragons are born, she
comes more and more into her own

263
00:13:57,620 --> 00:14:00,380
until the power
becomes innate to her.

264
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,780
It's about a new era. The whole
first season is essentially

265
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,980
the old era dying out
and the new era beginning.

266
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:10,780
And by the end,
she has a sense that she knows

267
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:13,140
that she's bound for greatness.

268
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:18,460
And after the break, watch
those dragons grow in season two.

269
00:14:21,289 --> 00:14:23,570
Welcome to Westeros where
the fight for the kingdom is on.

270
00:14:24,289 --> 00:14:28,369
<i>Welcome back to Game Of Thrones,
"The Story So Far", where season two</i>

271
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:32,249
<i>marks a new reign of tyranny
in the capital King's Landing.</i>

272
00:14:32,369 --> 00:14:34,409
<i>Joffrey is brutalising his subjects</i>

273
00:14:34,569 --> 00:14:36,809
<i>as well as his bride-to-be,
Sansa Stark.</i>

274
00:14:36,969 --> 00:14:39,689
You can't!
What did you say?

275
00:14:39,849 --> 00:14:42,969
Sansa has learned some
painful lessons along the way.

276
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:46,449
The chivalrous knights and gallant
princes that she dreamed of,

277
00:14:46,609 --> 00:14:49,649
she got a gallant prince
and he turned out to be Joffrey.

278
00:14:49,809 --> 00:14:52,369
Killing you would send
your brother a message.

279
00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:58,249
She's a prisoner in the worst place
imaginable, enduring all kinds

280
00:14:58,409 --> 00:15:01,969
of psychological and sometimes
physical abuse from these captors.

281
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:03,089
Leave her face.

282
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:05,769
I like her pretty.

283
00:15:10,129 --> 00:15:13,649
He's a bully
and we don't like bullies.

284
00:15:13,809 --> 00:15:16,009
Joffrey is the character
throughout the series

285
00:15:16,129 --> 00:15:18,049
that the audience loves to hate.

286
00:15:18,209 --> 00:15:22,929
I heard a disgusting lie
about uncle Jaime. And you?

287
00:15:23,049 --> 00:15:25,929
He's a despicable human being.

288
00:15:28,329 --> 00:15:32,329
Cersei's smart enough to
realise that Joffrey is perhaps

289
00:15:32,449 --> 00:15:35,529
not what she might have hoped for

290
00:15:35,689 --> 00:15:38,649
and he's getting out of her
control now and he's a danger,

291
00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:42,529
in part, even to her and even
to other members of the family.

292
00:15:42,689 --> 00:15:46,089
What you just did
is punishable by death.

293
00:15:49,289 --> 00:15:51,249
Joffrey's enemies are everywhere.

294
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:54,089
Chief amongst them, and just
across the bay at Dragonstone,

295
00:15:54,249 --> 00:15:57,129
is Stannis, brother
of the late King Robert,

296
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:59,169
who believes the throne
should be his.

297
00:16:01,049 --> 00:16:04,609
Stannis has learned that Robert's
children are Lannister bastards,

298
00:16:04,769 --> 00:16:07,449
which means that it is Stannis
who is next in line.

299
00:16:07,609 --> 00:16:11,649
So Stannis Baratheon, who knows King
Joffrey is the product of incest,

300
00:16:11,809 --> 00:16:15,049
decides to send ravens out to all
the corners of the Seven Kingdoms,

301
00:16:15,209 --> 00:16:17,529
letting them know
the Lannister secret.

302
00:16:17,689 --> 00:16:20,169
In order to claim the throne,
Stannis enlists

303
00:16:20,289 --> 00:16:22,209
the Red Priestess, Melisandre,

304
00:16:22,369 --> 00:16:25,729
who was on her own mission to find
the right ruler for Westeros.

305
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:29,889
She believes Stannis is the
saviour of the world, basically.

306
00:16:30,049 --> 00:16:31,929
He's supposed to be
on the Iron Throne.

307
00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:35,609
And her magical powers
have no limits, I think.

308
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:38,529
There's... There's so much that
we don't know that she can do.

309
00:16:38,689 --> 00:16:41,929
However, Stannis isn't the
only one after the throne.

310
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:44,449
His younger brother, Renly,
also believes he has a claim

311
00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:46,489
and so war is inevitable.

312
00:16:46,609 --> 00:16:49,249
The Iron Throne is mine by right.

313
00:16:49,409 --> 00:16:52,049
All those that
deny that are my foes.

314
00:16:54,049 --> 00:16:56,169
The whole realm denies it,
from Dorne to the Wall.

315
00:16:56,329 --> 00:16:59,169
They both think they should be king
but I'm on Stannis's side,

316
00:16:59,289 --> 00:17:01,409
so screw Renly.

317
00:17:01,569 --> 00:17:03,409
Rather than fight
it out on the battlefield,

318
00:17:03,569 --> 00:17:05,649
Stannis finds
another way to kill his brother.

319
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:08,009
Family ties don't mean
an awful lot in Westeros.

320
00:17:08,169 --> 00:17:11,129
The powerful sorcery of
the Red Priestess is revealed

321
00:17:11,289 --> 00:17:13,489
when she gives birth
to a sinister weapon.

322
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:16,169
Aarrgghh!

323
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:21,329
The shadow baby is basically
just a way to kill Renly

324
00:17:21,489 --> 00:17:24,689
and it comes out of me
in a great way.

325
00:17:27,729 --> 00:17:32,089
I think Melisandre, she's
always lived by this religion.

326
00:17:33,729 --> 00:17:35,689
If she's got something to do,
she's gonna do it

327
00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:38,049
and she's not gonna let
other people stand in her way.

328
00:17:38,209 --> 00:17:40,209
What I think is brilliant
about Game Of Thrones,

329
00:17:40,369 --> 00:17:43,169
it's a fantasy world but it's
a completely realistic depiction of

330
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:47,089
how power works. What power does to
people, what people do to get power,

331
00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:51,049
what happens when they fall short, when they
miss the mark. That's why it's so brilliant.

332
00:17:51,209 --> 00:17:55,089
Ugh!
Ugh-ugh!

333
00:17:55,249 --> 00:17:57,929
When Renly is murdered,
it leaves behind his widow,

334
00:17:58,089 --> 00:18:01,529
Margaery Tyrell,
who belongs to the Tyrell family,

335
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:03,729
who are very rich and
powerful in their own right.

336
00:18:03,889 --> 00:18:06,249
Calling yourself king
doesn't make you one

337
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:09,449
and if Renly wasn't a king,
I wasn't a queen.

338
00:18:10,929 --> 00:18:15,009
She knows how to play the game. She
really knows how to play the game.

339
00:18:15,129 --> 00:18:17,249
Do you want to be a queen?

340
00:18:17,369 --> 00:18:19,289
No.

341
00:18:20,289 --> 00:18:22,489
I want to be THE queen.

342
00:18:24,249 --> 00:18:28,249
As one would-be king is extinguished,
another rises up

343
00:18:28,409 --> 00:18:32,089
as season two sees a small but
vicious family enter the fray.

344
00:18:32,249 --> 00:18:37,369
A seafaring house that commands the
greatest fleet of ships in Westeros.

345
00:18:37,529 --> 00:18:41,169
It is led by Balon Greyjoy,
whose son Theon,

346
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,369
a captive of the
Starks since childhood,

347
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,409
has finally made it back home.

348
00:18:46,689 --> 00:18:48,649
We take what is ours.

349
00:18:50,169 --> 00:18:52,929
Your time with the wolves
has made you weak.

350
00:18:53,089 --> 00:18:56,249
Theon Greyjoy has grown up
with the Stark family,

351
00:18:56,409 --> 00:18:59,769
he was a sort of a prisoner
from a war in the past.

352
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:04,209
He now returns to his motherland,
which is the Iron Islands

353
00:19:04,329 --> 00:19:06,609
and decides to betray the Starks.

354
00:19:06,769 --> 00:19:09,769
You would have our father
bow down to your other family?

355
00:19:09,889 --> 00:19:12,449
I have no other family!

356
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:15,689
Theon's sister Yara,
a battle-hardened warrior,

357
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:18,209
is now heir to the Iron Islands.

358
00:19:18,369 --> 00:19:23,089
Yara is strong and fierce.
When Theon comes back

359
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:26,929
and stakes his claim,
she's worked too hard for this

360
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:29,569
and is not giving that up.

361
00:19:29,729 --> 00:19:33,529
To prove his loyalty,
Theon invades Winterfell.

362
00:19:33,689 --> 00:19:37,329
The ravens are informing
my father of my victory here.

363
00:19:37,489 --> 00:19:40,209
This leaves the Stark
family home in chaos

364
00:19:40,369 --> 00:19:43,369
and he takes the younger
Stark brothers captive.

365
00:19:43,529 --> 00:19:47,529
Prince Theon.
I yield to Prince Theon.

366
00:19:47,689 --> 00:19:50,889
Across the Narrow Sea,
Daenerys Targaryen is learning

367
00:19:51,049 --> 00:19:53,449
valuable lessons
in her quest to return

368
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:55,809
to Westeros and seize the throne.

369
00:19:55,929 --> 00:19:58,649
She's desperate to be a good ruler.

370
00:19:58,809 --> 00:20:01,449
That she can, you know,
go to bed at night saying,

371
00:20:01,609 --> 00:20:04,009
'I think I'm doing things
the right way.'

372
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:07,129
As Daenerys's power grows
so do her dragons

373
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:09,169
but as news of their
existence spreads,

374
00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:11,569
they become highly sought after.

375
00:20:11,729 --> 00:20:14,489
When she's in Qarth, everybody
kind of thinks, 'Who are you?

376
00:20:14,649 --> 00:20:18,129
'We'll just take your dragons.
and you're not powerful any more.'

377
00:20:22,729 --> 00:20:24,689
Dracarys!

378
00:20:26,529 --> 00:20:29,049
People have underestimated her
the whole way.

379
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,049
And it is in season two
that we finally see

380
00:20:33,169 --> 00:20:35,089
the dragons kill for Daenerys.

381
00:20:35,209 --> 00:20:36,889
Aarrgghh!

382
00:20:40,129 --> 00:20:43,769
As Daenerys gets stronger in exile,
Jon Snow and the Night's Watch

383
00:20:43,889 --> 00:20:45,809
are on a mission beyond the Wall

384
00:20:45,969 --> 00:20:49,009
where the true scale of the
threat to the kingdom is revealed.

385
00:20:49,129 --> 00:20:51,609
Blow the horn. Somebody come.

386
00:20:51,729 --> 00:20:53,769
The army of the dead is on its way

387
00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:56,889
and it's gonna kick off sooner
or later and really, you know,

388
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:59,529
they've got to get out of there
as fast as they possibly can.

389
00:20:59,649 --> 00:21:03,889
One blast for friends, two for foes.

390
00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:07,809
And three for White Walkers.

391
00:21:07,969 --> 00:21:10,049
The threat of winter
coming is very much

392
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:12,409
a myth to the people of the south.

393
00:21:12,569 --> 00:21:14,449
They're not
really taking it seriously.

394
00:21:14,569 --> 00:21:16,489
They don't know about the undead

395
00:21:16,649 --> 00:21:19,609
and all the horrors
that are coming towards them.

396
00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:25,529
Three blasts.
Come on!

397
00:21:25,689 --> 00:21:27,649
So what we learn
in season two is that

398
00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:29,849
the White Walkers
are very much real.

399
00:21:30,009 --> 00:21:33,089
They're nothing like we've
ever seen before in television.

400
00:21:33,249 --> 00:21:35,449
They're not just zombies,
they're not just statues,

401
00:21:35,609 --> 00:21:38,049
they're walking
ice cubes, basically.

402
00:21:38,209 --> 00:21:40,929
Um, they're, they're really
bad and they're really scary

403
00:21:41,089 --> 00:21:44,609
and it's literally... I think it's
got to be a fight of ice and fire.

404
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:53,689
We have all these kingdoms
wanting to fight for the throne

405
00:21:53,849 --> 00:21:58,129
and they think that that is what
ultimately the battle is about.

406
00:21:58,249 --> 00:22:00,449
But really, at the end of the day,

407
00:22:00,609 --> 00:22:03,769
they're not looking at
what's the real problem here

408
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:05,809
and it's the White Walkers.

409
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:11,569
<i>And it's in season two,
in King's Landing,</i>

410
00:22:11,729 --> 00:22:13,969
<i>where we see that Tyrion
may just be an asset</i>

411
00:22:14,129 --> 00:22:17,609
<i>to the war when Stannis
launches an attack on the city.</i>

412
00:22:19,969 --> 00:22:21,689
I'll leave you dead.

413
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:24,049
The battle of Blackwater
was his moment.

414
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:27,689
He was the best person to speak
to the people of King's Landing

415
00:22:27,849 --> 00:22:31,569
and to get them to protect their,
their... their... their city

416
00:22:31,729 --> 00:22:34,289
because he knows
what it's like to fight,

417
00:22:34,449 --> 00:22:37,129
he knows what it's like to have
your back up against the wall.

418
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:40,609
We like an underdog.
And when they...

419
00:22:40,769 --> 00:22:44,089
When the underdog manages
to come out on top,

420
00:22:44,209 --> 00:22:46,169
it's a cause for celebration.

421
00:22:46,329 --> 00:22:49,689
Those are brave men
knocking at our door.

422
00:22:50,929 --> 00:22:53,809
Let's go kill them!

423
00:22:55,569 --> 00:22:59,529
Tyrion manages to get the
troops fired up by giving

424
00:22:59,689 --> 00:23:03,049
a good speech and then
heads out with them to fight

425
00:23:03,209 --> 00:23:05,849
Stannis on the bay.
He doesn't last very long,

426
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:07,889
he gets knocked out
after a couple of minutes.

427
00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:10,849
<i>Tyrion is upstaged
by his father Tywin,</i>

428
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:12,889
<i>who arrives with
his own massive army.</i>

429
00:23:13,049 --> 00:23:16,169
<i>He's been bolstered by the Tyrells,
who firmly joined the cause</i>

430
00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:18,489
<i>and they crush the Stannis attack.</i>

431
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:21,329
Certain people
have luck on their side.

432
00:23:21,489 --> 00:23:24,489
Other people don't.
Possibly Stannis is one of those...

433
00:23:25,849 --> 00:23:31,249
...very, very unlucky characters
who are destined not to achieve

434
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:33,249
- their goals.
- Let's fight!

435
00:23:33,369 --> 00:23:35,889
Tywin's pretty lucky.

436
00:23:36,009 --> 00:23:38,169
Fortune tends to smile on him

437
00:23:38,329 --> 00:23:41,089
- when it should damn him.
- Father.

438
00:23:41,249 --> 00:23:45,489
And yet, against all the odds,
that battle is won.

439
00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:50,449
The battle is over.
We have won.

440
00:23:55,849 --> 00:23:59,369
<i>Season three begins,
Daenerys has set sail on a mission.</i>

441
00:23:59,529 --> 00:24:02,649
<i>She and her dragons may have
grown in power and stature</i>

442
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:05,129
<i>but securing an army
still eludes her.</i>

443
00:24:05,289 --> 00:24:07,889
<i>So she ventures to a place
where she can buy one.</i>

444
00:24:10,609 --> 00:24:13,969
She knows she needs an army,
a powerful army,

445
00:24:14,129 --> 00:24:17,089
if she ever wants to
reclaim the Westerosi throne

446
00:24:17,249 --> 00:24:20,377
and the best bet for
that are the Unsullied.

447
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,590
I have dragons.

448
00:24:21,649 --> 00:24:22,947
I'll give you one.

449
00:24:22,958 --> 00:24:26,779
She appears to want to
trade the dragon for slaves.

450
00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:29,289
She seems to have made
this daft agreement

451
00:24:29,409 --> 00:24:31,329
to give away her best dragon.

452
00:24:34,569 --> 00:24:36,569
She hands over the dragon.
Next thing you know,

453
00:24:36,729 --> 00:24:38,489
once she has control
of the Unsullied...

454
00:24:42,969 --> 00:24:44,889
...then it's very easy
to say to the dragon

455
00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:48,369
who still will listen to her
and not to him, 'Burn him.'

456
00:24:48,489 --> 00:24:49,849
Dracarys!

457
00:24:52,649 --> 00:24:53,849
No! No! No!

458
00:24:54,009 --> 00:24:57,129
Because you would take power
if you have the force of a dragon,

459
00:24:57,249 --> 00:24:59,489
they're pretty impressive creatures.

460
00:24:59,649 --> 00:25:02,249
She's been the mother of dragons
and knew she was destined

461
00:25:02,409 --> 00:25:04,969
for greatness but now she
really is a queen with an army.

462
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:08,249
To then see that she
has thousands of people

463
00:25:08,409 --> 00:25:14,649
on her team and then you get,
like, this swoop past.

464
00:25:14,809 --> 00:25:18,769
She's got these, like,
fire-breathing mythical creatures

465
00:25:18,929 --> 00:25:21,369
that they're
just gonna tear shit up.

466
00:25:21,529 --> 00:25:24,609
As this young Targaryen
gains followers,

467
00:25:24,769 --> 00:25:27,889
in King's Landing, a young
Tyrell is gaining influence.

468
00:25:28,049 --> 00:25:30,969
Margaery has replaced Sansa
in Joffrey's affections,

469
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:34,329
a reward for her family's
military support at Blackwater.

470
00:25:36,289 --> 00:25:40,369
I imagine it must be so exciting
to squeeze your finger here

471
00:25:40,489 --> 00:25:43,289
and watch something die over there.

472
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:46,929
Margaery is a woman
who's on top of her game,

473
00:25:47,089 --> 00:25:50,929
she's controlling where she's going,
she's a proper feminist icon.

474
00:25:51,089 --> 00:25:54,369
But the Tyrells' ambitions
are not going down well

475
00:25:54,529 --> 00:25:57,849
with Cersei Lannister. Alana
is the matriarch of the family

476
00:25:58,009 --> 00:26:01,929
and she advises her granddaughter on
how best to play the political game,

477
00:26:02,089 --> 00:26:04,569
so that she might
take power in King's Landing.

478
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:09,329
To make matters worse, her soulmate
Jaime is a prisoner of war.

479
00:26:09,449 --> 00:26:11,289
He is held first by Brienne of Tarth

480
00:26:11,449 --> 00:26:13,889
then both are captured
by a northern faction.

481
00:26:14,049 --> 00:26:16,729
Looks like your woman's
getting the better of you.

482
00:26:16,889 --> 00:26:20,689
This is all bundled up in when Jaime
starts thinking about other people.

483
00:26:20,849 --> 00:26:23,129
- You're only making it worse.
- Argh!

484
00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:27,769
His efforts to stop Brienne being
raped are the beginning of that.

485
00:26:27,889 --> 00:26:30,329
You know who she is, don't you?

486
00:26:30,489 --> 00:26:33,289
Argh! It's good when those
little bits of goodness

487
00:26:33,449 --> 00:26:35,729
come in those characters
that are so devilish as well.

488
00:26:35,889 --> 00:26:37,969
Just give you
a little light in there.

489
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:40,209
Lord Selwyn would pay
his daughter's weight

490
00:26:40,369 --> 00:26:42,569
in sapphires if
she's returned to him.

491
00:26:42,729 --> 00:26:45,329
It being Game Of Thrones,
it doesn't get him anywhere.

492
00:26:46,449 --> 00:26:49,049
Argh! Argh! Aarrgghh!

493
00:26:49,209 --> 00:26:52,009
Another one of those Game Of Thrones
moments which has so much more

494
00:26:52,169 --> 00:26:55,129
going on in it than just him
losing his hand. He's the greatest

495
00:26:55,289 --> 00:26:58,649
swordsman in Westeros we're told,
so he can't do that any more.

496
00:26:58,809 --> 00:27:01,849
He's now made a good friend in
her and he's seen a lot of things

497
00:27:02,009 --> 00:27:07,009
and I'm sure he's questioning what
being a Lannister is about as well.

498
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:11,169
Yet, without his hand, we see
Jaime Lannister at his most heroic.

499
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:14,249
The heartless knight who pushed
Bran Stark from the tower

500
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:16,409
finds new honour in season three.

501
00:27:16,569 --> 00:27:19,969
He's left, he's left her behind,
he's abandoned her

502
00:27:20,129 --> 00:27:22,489
and he's on his way
to King's Landing

503
00:27:22,649 --> 00:27:27,449
and then his captors mention
what's gonna happen to her.

504
00:27:27,609 --> 00:27:30,649
Not fair? And then he decides
to return and save her.

505
00:27:34,449 --> 00:27:37,569
And it is in season three that
we witness the fearsome work

506
00:27:37,729 --> 00:27:40,169
of another powerful family,
the Boltons,

507
00:27:40,329 --> 00:27:43,049
who are scheming
to take control of the North.

508
00:27:43,209 --> 00:27:45,649
I think the Boltons want
what everyone else seems to want,

509
00:27:45,769 --> 00:27:48,289
it's power and status.

510
00:27:48,409 --> 00:27:50,529
Kill me!

511
00:27:52,289 --> 00:27:55,769
You're no good to me dead.
We need you.

512
00:27:55,889 --> 00:27:57,769
Ramsay, a bastard son of the family,

513
00:27:57,929 --> 00:28:01,609
enjoys torturing his enemies,
including Theon Greyjoy,

514
00:28:01,769 --> 00:28:05,449
who he took prisoner when sacking
Winterfell after Ned's demise.

515
00:28:05,609 --> 00:28:08,929
Historically, the Boltons have
always been just under the Starks,

516
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:11,129
kind of the Starks have
always been on top of them,

517
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:15,049
so I think they feel
that now is their time to rise.

518
00:28:15,209 --> 00:28:19,129
You don't look like
Theon Greyjoy any more.

519
00:28:19,289 --> 00:28:23,089
It's unbelievable what Ramsay
is capable of doing to people.

520
00:28:23,249 --> 00:28:25,929
Freak!
He's just all about the mind.

521
00:28:26,089 --> 00:28:27,889
He's all about
making you doubt yourself.

522
00:28:28,049 --> 00:28:30,449
He's all about getting in there
and making you insecure

523
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:34,049
and making you feel like
you can't go up against him.

524
00:28:34,209 --> 00:28:37,249
Another hostage at large
in season three is Arya Stark

525
00:28:37,409 --> 00:28:40,409
kidnapped by the Hound.
The disgraced knight

526
00:28:40,569 --> 00:28:43,649
plans to find Arya's family
and trade her for cash.

527
00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:46,809
Remember what happens
to children who run.

528
00:28:46,969 --> 00:28:51,169
One of the great double acts of Game
Of Thrones is the Hound and Arya.

529
00:28:53,929 --> 00:28:56,569
Don't! Don't kill him.

530
00:28:56,729 --> 00:29:01,089
There's something so perversely
magical about that pairing,

531
00:29:01,249 --> 00:29:05,769
sort of warped mentor-protege
relationship that develops.

532
00:29:12,649 --> 00:29:16,529
In his desire to claim a ransom,
the Hound heads for the Twins

533
00:29:16,689 --> 00:29:20,169
where he knows Arya's mother
and brother, Catelyn and Robb Stark,

534
00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:22,209
are attending a wedding.

535
00:29:22,409 --> 00:29:25,969
The Twins is a strategic river
crossing controlled by the Frey family

536
00:29:26,129 --> 00:29:29,089
and the Starks need them
on side for their war effort.

537
00:29:29,249 --> 00:29:32,689
Walder Frey is a very
bitter nasty old man

538
00:29:32,849 --> 00:29:35,609
who controls a small but
significant area in the kingdom.

539
00:29:35,769 --> 00:29:38,809
I was pledged to marry one
of you and I broke that vow.

540
00:29:38,969 --> 00:29:43,689
If he's been let down by
Robb Stark after this promise,

541
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:48,529
if he shows any kind of forgiveness
or, 'Just let it go.

542
00:29:48,689 --> 00:29:51,369
'He didn't want to marry my
daughter, he married someone else.'

543
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:54,649
He would lose face in that world,

544
00:29:54,809 --> 00:29:57,249
it's a vicious world
he's operating in.

545
00:29:57,409 --> 00:30:00,409
The Stark family offer
Robb's uncle to make amends,

546
00:30:00,569 --> 00:30:03,289
they're here for that wedding,
a terrible mistake.

547
00:30:04,409 --> 00:30:08,569
Also at the wedding is Roose,
head of House Bolton.

548
00:30:08,729 --> 00:30:11,889
Traditionally loyal to the Starks
but not for much longer.

549
00:30:13,089 --> 00:30:16,569
Robb's decision not to marry
Walder Frey's daughter,

550
00:30:16,729 --> 00:30:19,929
he knows he's alienating and going
to upset a very powerful house

551
00:30:20,089 --> 00:30:23,649
and a very, very powerful man.
So he changes his allegiance.

552
00:30:26,129 --> 00:30:28,649
Catelyn, in her heart,

553
00:30:28,809 --> 00:30:32,329
knew that you do not break a promise
if you are the king of the North

554
00:30:32,489 --> 00:30:35,169
and you certainly don't break
it to Walder Frey. Your grace...

555
00:30:35,329 --> 00:30:38,889
He's probably laid awake for nights
just planning it and timing it

556
00:30:39,049 --> 00:30:41,249
and working out just how
it's gonna work out.

557
00:30:41,409 --> 00:30:44,329
The moment where Cat
sees that Roose Bolton

558
00:30:44,489 --> 00:30:48,049
is wearing chain mail
is a powerful moment.

559
00:30:49,249 --> 00:30:51,289
Why would you wear
chain mail to a wedding?

560
00:30:51,449 --> 00:30:54,849
What is the purpose of chain mail?
It's to prevent you getting killed.

561
00:30:56,369 --> 00:30:58,089
Robb!

562
00:30:58,209 --> 00:31:00,969
Catelyn and Robb and his wife

563
00:31:01,129 --> 00:31:03,769
and all the others,
nobody saw it coming.

564
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:06,729
The Red Wedding is the event
that pretty much decimates

565
00:31:06,889 --> 00:31:08,969
an entire generation
of the Stark family.

566
00:31:09,929 --> 00:31:12,729
Within the Game Of Thrones,
Walder Frey's not playing

567
00:31:12,889 --> 00:31:15,449
the Game Of Thrones.
He's not attempting to be the king.

568
00:31:15,609 --> 00:31:17,929
He's actually perfectly
happy with what he's got.

569
00:31:18,049 --> 00:31:20,089
He has his own little fiefdom

570
00:31:20,249 --> 00:31:23,009
and he's sitting in the chair
watching terrible things.

571
00:31:23,169 --> 00:31:25,049
Robb is such an amazing character,
I think

572
00:31:25,209 --> 00:31:28,449
you kind of want
him to be the king...

573
00:31:28,609 --> 00:31:30,729
Mother...
..and to win.

574
00:31:31,969 --> 00:31:34,089
The Lannisters send their regards.

575
00:31:35,049 --> 00:31:38,609
It's brutal. 'I'm going to let you know
this information just before I kill you.'

576
00:31:41,769 --> 00:31:46,129
It's another illustration of what
Tywin Lannister is prepared to do.

577
00:31:48,609 --> 00:31:50,649
Aarrgghh!

578
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:54,889
And in that case, he's got somebody
else to do his dirty work.

579
00:31:56,729 --> 00:32:00,249
It's the cruelty of it
and it's the relishing of it.

580
00:32:02,089 --> 00:32:06,169
Everything goes to hell
at the Red Wedding.

581
00:32:06,329 --> 00:32:09,009
Arya Stark arrives
at the Twins to witness

582
00:32:09,169 --> 00:32:13,729
her brother's desecrated body and
loses any last shred of innocence.

583
00:32:13,889 --> 00:32:15,609
She's there.
She's at the Red Wedding,

584
00:32:15,769 --> 00:32:19,249
she's outside and
she was so close, you know,

585
00:32:19,409 --> 00:32:22,049
she was so close to seeing
them again, she was so close.

586
00:32:22,249 --> 00:32:25,889
The path that she goes on,
she learns to become stronger

587
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:29,649
and fight and also
she was after revenge.

588
00:32:29,809 --> 00:32:32,729
<i>And when she comes across
her family's killers later...</i>

589
00:32:32,889 --> 00:32:35,209
- You little shit.
- <i>...she matches their brutality.</i>

590
00:32:37,929 --> 00:32:41,529
She's had to go over
to the dark side,

591
00:32:41,649 --> 00:32:43,569
that's what makes her interesting.

592
00:32:43,729 --> 00:32:47,689
In order to survive in that world,
you have to match what is given you.

593
00:32:47,809 --> 00:32:50,209
And so, by the end of season three,

594
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:53,409
all the elder Starks have
gone from the Game Of Thrones.

595
00:32:53,569 --> 00:32:57,489
Only the children remain, orphaned
and scattered across Westeros,

596
00:32:57,649 --> 00:33:00,769
including Bran Stark,
still paralysed from his fall.

597
00:33:00,929 --> 00:33:04,449
He's fled Winterfell with a loyal
band of followers heading north.

598
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:07,889
So, Hodor we know as
a very loyal character.

599
00:33:08,049 --> 00:33:10,969
- All right, Hodor?
- Hodor.

600
00:33:11,129 --> 00:33:14,249
He lost the use of his legs and
Hodor's the person that carries him

601
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:16,289
around and takes him everywhere,

602
00:33:16,449 --> 00:33:18,569
um, being the big giant
of a man that he is.

603
00:33:20,689 --> 00:33:23,969
It's all right,
the wolves will protect him.

604
00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:27,649
Him and his brother Rickon
are the two last male heirs

605
00:33:27,769 --> 00:33:29,729
to the Stark household.

606
00:33:29,889 --> 00:33:35,489
Um, and, yeah, it's fast depleting,
we're running out of Starks.

607
00:33:35,649 --> 00:33:38,569
I think it's all about Rickon and
Bran kind of sticking together

608
00:33:38,729 --> 00:33:43,289
and, you know, seeing how their
adventures and journeys play out

609
00:33:43,409 --> 00:33:46,449
to kind of find this lost happiness

610
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:48,689
and this lost family
that they're searching for.

611
00:33:48,849 --> 00:33:52,209
Bran Stark is very much
on his own journey to discover

612
00:33:52,369 --> 00:33:55,169
the roots of this ancient
magic that's reappearing

613
00:33:55,329 --> 00:33:57,489
in the kingdom
throughout the season.

614
00:33:57,649 --> 00:34:00,569
And yet, amid this loss,
comes a small victory.

615
00:34:00,729 --> 00:34:05,409
Unlikely hero Samwell Tarly stumbles
on a weakness of the White Walkers.

616
00:34:05,569 --> 00:34:08,329
Samwell reaches for
all he has to hand,

617
00:34:08,489 --> 00:34:11,729
an old dragonglass spear
he once found in the ground.

618
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:13,809
Ugh!

619
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:16,889
To his astonishment it... it works.

620
00:34:17,729 --> 00:34:21,169
The spells are shattered
and it's melting before him.

621
00:34:22,289 --> 00:34:27,809
And stay with us to see wedded bliss
vanish after the break. He's choking!

622
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:33,261
Welcome to Westeros where
the fight for the kingdom is on.

623
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:38,420
<i>Welcome back to Game Of Thrones,
"The Story So Far".</i>

624
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,140
<i>We're in season four,
a royal wedding in King's Landing</i>

625
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,900
<i>unites two great houses of Westeros,</i>

626
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,180
<i>the Tyrells and the Lannisters.</i>

627
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,940
Season four begins
with the wedding between

628
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:52,020
King Joffrey and Margaery Tyrell,

629
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:54,940
And as we know from
experience in Westeros,

630
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,020
weddings are not happy occasions.

631
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,900
It's full of injured parties
with scores to settle.

632
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:04,020
Chief among them is Oberyn Martell
and his lover Ellaria Sand.

633
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,940
In that first meeting
with Cersei and Tywin...

634
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:10,700
Ellaria Sand.
My lord, my lady.

635
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:15,180
...they see Ellaria
as being sort of scum.

636
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,860
Ha! I can't say
I've ever met a Sand before.

637
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:21,580
Oberyn has a zest for life and all
the beautiful things that the world

638
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:24,460
has to offer.
None of it is as beautiful

639
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,260
as his own rage
and taste for revenge.

640
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,100
Oberyn is seeking vengeance
for his sister's brutal death

641
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:31,700
at the hands of the Lannisters.

642
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:35,740
The rape and murder of women and
children is considered distasteful.

643
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:41,820
Oberyn has a massive grudge
against the Lannisters

644
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:46,300
and he's sort of coming to
the wedding to just sniff out

645
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,820
what's going on and to get justice.

646
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:52,220
There's been too much amusement...

647
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,500
Joffrey really uses
the wedding as an excuse

648
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:56,540
to be as horrible as he can.

649
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:00,580
Uncle, you can be my cup bearer.

650
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:04,020
And the way he treats Tyrion
and everybody at that table,

651
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,060
he's just hideous.

652
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,940
You're watching him
being a total arse.

653
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:16,540
And so when an unseen hand
poisons the newly wed king...

654
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,820
Idiots! Help your king!
Move away!

655
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:22,780
...it's the moment of retribution the whole
of the Seven Kingdoms have been waiting for.

656
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,020
I think everybody
who watches Game Of Thrones

657
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,380
was hoping this day would come.

658
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,380
Ugh!

659
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:35,700
I wanted to kill him
in such a way that the viewers

660
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,500
were reminded that here's
a 13-year-old boy who's dying.

661
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:42,700
Though it is actually the Tyrells
that have poisoned Joffrey,

662
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,740
it is Tyrion who is blamed.

663
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,820
This is really the point
where Tyrion's fragile bonds

664
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,860
with his family begin to unravel.

665
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,100
Take him! Take him!

666
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,220
Take him!

667
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:59,780
In plot terms, the death of Joffrey
is another shaking of the board

668
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,820
where the pieces are scattered.

669
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:05,500
And also it's one of those things
that elevate the whole series

670
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:08,860
from merely a story into a saga.

671
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:12,060
As the royal family grows weaker,
news from Westeros

672
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:15,020
reaches Meereen where Daenerys
has conquered the city

673
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:18,660
but she is not yet ready to
capitalise on her enemy's weakness.

674
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,940
King Joffrey Baratheon is dead.

675
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,500
Murdered at his own wedding.

676
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,820
This would appear
to be a really good time

677
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,420
for her to finally make
her play for the Iron Throne.

678
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:32,380
She has the dragons
and she has the army

679
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:34,300
and she has the
strength of character.

680
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,420
But actually she has
new responsibilities now

681
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,460
and she has unfinished
business where she is

682
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:41,340
and she's still trying
to learn how to rule.

683
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,500
And to compound matters,
her dragons have grown so big

684
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:47,420
that Daenerys has started
to lose control of them.

685
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,700
Ugh!

686
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:54,500
They get bigger as her power increases,
the harder it is for her to manage.

687
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,340
And that's where the
story then has to go.

688
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,620
All they're going to
bring is complexity.

689
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,980
And when one of the dragons
kills a child and abandons her,

690
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:08,460
Daenerys is left with no other
choice but to chain the other two.

691
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,820
She's just locked up her dragons,
so can she unleash them again

692
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,860
and will they forgive her?

693
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,980
Without the mighty
force of her dragons,

694
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:20,620
Daenerys is faced with a dilemma
as to what to do next.

695
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,980
She's definitely going through a
sort of a dark night of the soul,

696
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:29,620
I think, where she's trying to
determine, have I got what it takes?

697
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,980
And so, in season four,

698
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:35,380
as Daenerys remains in exile
across the Narrow Sea,

699
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:39,580
Sansa Stark has fled the capital
and taken refuge with her aunt Lysa,

700
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:42,260
who has been seduced
by an arch schemer.

701
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:49,620
Littlefinger is playing a very
chaotic game and he thrives on that.

702
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,540
Oh, my sweet wife.

703
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:56,580
For Littlefinger, it's all
about getting power, I think,

704
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:59,180
and using Lysa
as a pawn along the way.

705
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,300
Argh!

706
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:02,780
Sansa has witnessed Lysa's murder

707
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,820
and covers for Littlefinger.

708
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:09,500
Sansa's one of these
poor characters who's been

709
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:12,820
mistreated all through the series.

710
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:16,020
She's seen a lot of horrible,
horrible things happen

711
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:19,620
and she's never been able to take
control and this is the first time.

712
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,900
Actually, she's got
nothing else to lose.

713
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:24,380
He tried to reason with her,
promised her

714
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,780
she was the only woman
he'd ever loved.

715
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:31,380
But she stepped
through those doors...

716
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:36,220
What you discover is that she's
been learning this entire time.

717
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,340
She's been listening,
she's been watching.

718
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:45,300
She's been taking
Littlefinger's lessons to heart.

719
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:48,820
So, from one Stark
protege to another.

720
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:51,700
Sansa's sister Arya
is still the Hound's hostage

721
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:54,300
but they're now on an equal footing.

722
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,540
Who would pass the Bloody Gate?

723
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:00,300
The bloody Hound, Sandor Clegane.

724
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,540
He's her captor
but he's also her protector

725
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:07,820
and, you know, she's seen his own
pain and his own fear at times

726
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,580
and they've shared
some dangerous situations.

727
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,220
But when the Hound
is gravely injured in battle,

728
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:15,700
Arya is forced to
strike out on her own.

729
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,740
Fuck it! I'm ready.

730
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:23,180
Now he's wounded and he's dying
and she's remembering

731
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,860
all he said about mercy
and he's asking for mercy

732
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:30,020
and by mercy he means, you know,
a quick thrust to kill him.

733
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:33,180
And she doesn't give it to him.

734
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,860
Kill me.

735
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:38,100
She won't put him out of his misery,

736
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,340
she won't give him the easy way out,

737
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,540
she's going to leave
him there to suffer.

738
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:47,180
Another wandering Stark is
Arya's crippled brother Bran,

739
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:51,060
who has made it north of the Wall
in search of a Three-Eyed Raven

740
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:53,100
who he believes
will help him walk again.

741
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:56,540
All the time, aided by his
loyal travelling companion Hodor.

742
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:00,020
I think Hodor's more
than just Bran's legs.

743
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:04,700
I mean, I think he means a lot
to Bran, you know, someone to...

744
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:07,940
He's always been there through
absolutely everything, you know.

745
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,260
Even though he can't speak,
he can only say one word,

746
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,380
he's always someone
that's looking after him.

747
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:16,780
You know, in a world of evil, he's
probably one of the only good ones.

748
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:20,460
Clearly, Bran
is very important because

749
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:23,740
he's trekked all the way up north
to a cave where this raven

750
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,340
has been summoning him
for the past couple of seasons

751
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,780
and now he's in this cave
with the Three-Eyed Raven,

752
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:33,380
we're gonna find out what the grand
scheme of things is for Bran.

753
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,540
You'll never walk again.

754
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:40,100
But you will fly.

755
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:43,500
His powers, he's getting stronger

756
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:46,620
and there's gonna be some really
exciting things happening, I think.

757
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,660
We're gonna find out
more and more about him.

758
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:52,780
At the Wall, the Night's Watch
suffers a huge Wildling attack

759
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:57,380
at Castle Black but in season four
they get a powerful new ally.

760
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,980
Stannis Baratheon, who's
been away licking his wounds

761
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:04,140
after the Blackwater defeat
joins them with his vast army.

762
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:07,460
The Battle of the Blackwater
was a huge and crushing defeat

763
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:12,300
at the end of season two and it's
taken them basically two seasons

764
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:15,860
to sort of rebuild from that.
And his arrival means that Jon Snow

765
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:19,420
could have a new ally in the
battle against the White Walkers

766
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:23,020
beyond the Wall. If my father had
seen the things that I've seen,

767
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:26,220
he'd also tell you to burn
the dead before nightfall.

768
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,900
All of them.

769
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:32,340
Season four draws to
a mighty climax in King's Landing

770
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:35,620
when the ultimate father-and-son
showdown comes to a head.

771
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,660
Tyrion is tried for murder.

772
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:40,820
I'm guilty of being a dwarf.

773
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:46,660
- You're not on trial for being a dwarf.
- Oh, yes, I am.

774
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:50,500
I've been on trial
for that my entire life.

775
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:54,020
Finally, Tyrion just says,
'You know what this is about.

776
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:56,060
'It's because I'm a dwarf.'

777
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:58,100
You know.

778
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:03,340
And he's absolutely right,
that is what it's about.

779
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,900
He's put on trial for
a murder he doesn't commit.

780
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,020
His father deserts him
and betrays him.

781
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:11,380
I demand a trial by combat!

782
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:15,540
I mean, trial by combat, you can get
someone to fight for your honour,

783
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:17,380
so whether you're wrong or not,

784
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:20,380
as long as they win the fight,
that's what matters.

785
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:24,300
He names Oberyn Martell
as his champion.

786
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,380
You're going to fight that?

787
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,340
I'm going to kill that.

788
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:32,020
I think Ellaria has total faith

789
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:35,940
in the Red Viper,
her lover's powers as a fighter.

790
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:41,100
But the minute she sees
the Mountain, she doubts it.

791
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:47,780
The one thing that he's ever lived
for is to avenge his sister's death

792
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:51,420
and he knows that now that the
opportunity is presenting itself,

793
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:54,140
there is no question that
he will get what he wants.

794
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,580
You killed my sister!

795
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:04,900
And he does get what he wants by
forcing a confession out of him.

796
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:08,780
It's not exactly how he expected it.

797
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:11,100
Aarrgghh!
I killed her children.

798
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:13,060
He still technically
got what he wanted.

799
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,660
Aarrgghh!
Then I raped her. Aarrgghh!

800
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:18,260
Then I smashed
her head in like this.

801
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:20,220
Argh!

802
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:27,820
She's lost the man who was her
protector, who was her champion,

803
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:33,220
who was everything that
she believed in in her world.

804
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,860
Tyrion Lannister...

805
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:40,220
With his champion defeated, Tyrion's
life now hangs in the balance.

806
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,020
...you are hereby sentenced to death.

807
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:49,900
In Westeros, the pursuit of justice
is as futile as anything else.

808
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:53,340
Oh, get on with it,
you son of a whore.

809
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,660
Is that any way to
speak about our mother?

810
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:59,140
Tyrion is released from jail
by his brother Jaime

811
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,500
and told to go and
board a ship and run away.

812
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:04,620
Instead, he decides
to check in on his father.

813
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:05,780
Mmm!

814
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:10,060
But it's his former lover Shae
that he discovers in Tywin's bed.

815
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:13,340
Tyrion then kills Shae
in a sort of fit of jealousy

816
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:17,460
and then takes a crossbow
and goes to find his father.

817
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,500
Tyrion.

818
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:21,860
Put down the crossbow.

819
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:25,580
Tywin really has
had it coming to him.

820
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,340
Ugh!

821
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:34,060
I don't know how much more Tywin
could have got away with, really.

822
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:36,860
Especially after what
he's put Tyrion through.

823
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:40,860
- You're no son of mine.
- I am your son.

824
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:45,900
This is someone who spent his whole
life trying to win his approbation,

825
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:49,940
as much as he hated him, he
really wanted that, you know.

826
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,780
Obviously that's
never gonna happen now

827
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:54,660
because he put a crossbow
bolt in his groin.

828
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:58,980
Ugh! What it means, is when
a big character like that goes,

829
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:02,700
there's gonna be a power vacuum
and there's gonna be hustling

830
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,740
and jostling to get into his place.

831
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:08,900
I am the queen!
I am the queen! I'm not...

832
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,900
Join us after the break where,
in season five,

833
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:14,740
a new power rises in King's Landing.

834
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:22,266
Welcome to Westeros where
the fight for the kingdom is on.

835
00:46:23,265 --> 00:46:27,065
<i>Welcome back to "The Story So Far".
Where, in season five,</i>

836
00:46:27,185 --> 00:46:29,585
<i>a royal wedding unsettles Cersei.</i>

837
00:46:30,665 --> 00:46:33,865
<i>Her son Tommen is now king
and has fallen under the spell</i>

838
00:46:34,025 --> 00:46:37,345
<i>of his new queen Margaery,
much to Cersei's dismay.</i>

839
00:46:37,465 --> 00:46:39,385
When Margaery'd come in his life,

840
00:46:39,585 --> 00:46:42,425
I think he was just
enjoying life so much.

841
00:46:42,585 --> 00:46:45,625
Judging from the king's enthusiasm,
the Queen Mother

842
00:46:45,785 --> 00:46:48,665
- will be a queen grandmother soon.
- Wouldn't that be a lovely day?

843
00:46:48,825 --> 00:46:51,665
Him being king was just a whole
new excitement, a whole new life.

844
00:46:52,425 --> 00:46:55,025
Cersei empowers religious fanatics

845
00:46:55,185 --> 00:46:57,505
to help her topple her rival,
Queen Margaery.

846
00:46:57,665 --> 00:46:59,945
I can't hear it.
I am the queen!

847
00:47:00,105 --> 00:47:02,105
Cersei brings back
the Faith Militant

848
00:47:02,265 --> 00:47:05,225
because, in her mind, this is
her wiping the slate clean,

849
00:47:05,385 --> 00:47:09,505
this is her taking an opportunity
to claw back a little bit of power.

850
00:47:09,665 --> 00:47:12,945
But Cersei's engineered
her own downfall.

851
00:47:13,105 --> 00:47:16,785
Royalty is no longer above the law
and fanatics come for her next.

852
00:47:19,585 --> 00:47:23,625
It's hard to see how anybody would
be able to get the power back

853
00:47:23,785 --> 00:47:26,785
from the High Sparrow
and Septa Unella.

854
00:47:26,945 --> 00:47:30,985
Move. There's another
contender to power in Westeros

855
00:47:31,145 --> 00:47:33,545
and it's religion.
It's the power of the faith.

856
00:47:33,705 --> 00:47:38,105
They want to remove
all the excesses.

857
00:47:38,225 --> 00:47:41,905
To strip Cersei of all her finery

858
00:47:42,065 --> 00:47:46,145
and encourage her, in inverted
commas, to become clean.

859
00:47:46,305 --> 00:47:49,345
It's such a sexualised
form of humiliation.

860
00:47:49,465 --> 00:47:51,265
A sinner comes before you.

861
00:47:51,425 --> 00:47:54,305
Watching Cersei
do the walk of atonement,

862
00:47:54,465 --> 00:47:57,145
something happened that
I thought would never happen

863
00:47:57,265 --> 00:47:59,225
and that is I felt compassion.

864
00:47:59,385 --> 00:48:03,425
No matter what she'd done
previously, she didn't deserve this.

865
00:48:03,585 --> 00:48:08,145
And so season five sees her
left naked before her subjects

866
00:48:08,305 --> 00:48:11,985
to atone for her infidelities.

867
00:48:12,145 --> 00:48:14,545
Who would've thought we
would've felt sorry for Cersei

868
00:48:14,705 --> 00:48:17,605
- until the walk of shame?
- It was very, very tough for her.

869
00:48:17,645 --> 00:48:20,745
Very few women could have done
what she did, complete that walk.

870
00:48:20,905 --> 00:48:25,305
People love to hate her,
so you see her

871
00:48:25,465 --> 00:48:29,225
trying to maintain
this regal presence

872
00:48:29,345 --> 00:48:31,185
but she can't.

873
00:48:31,345 --> 00:48:34,625
Stripped down to her, literally,
physically and emotionally

874
00:48:34,785 --> 00:48:37,305
and psychologically, stripped
down to her most vulnerable

875
00:48:37,465 --> 00:48:40,545
and then swept up into the
arms of the beast that she...

876
00:48:40,665 --> 00:48:43,025
that she invited into the world.

877
00:48:43,185 --> 00:48:46,985
The strange creation
that is her new knight.

878
00:48:47,105 --> 00:48:49,465
It's just a brilliant twist.

879
00:48:49,625 --> 00:48:51,505
When Cersei's picked up
by the Mountain

880
00:48:51,665 --> 00:48:55,225
and Qyburn tells her
what's happened,

881
00:48:55,385 --> 00:48:57,865
the brilliant look
across Cersei's eyes

882
00:48:58,025 --> 00:49:02,385
of, 'Whatever happens,
I will get these people.'

883
00:49:04,265 --> 00:49:07,705
Also getting a new ally
in season five is Daenerys,

884
00:49:07,865 --> 00:49:10,585
in the form of Tyrion.
After killing his father,

885
00:49:10,745 --> 00:49:14,785
he's fled across the Narrow Sea,
a fugitive on the run.

886
00:49:14,945 --> 00:49:18,985
He was a Lannister and he
had all the money in the world

887
00:49:19,145 --> 00:49:23,385
and a noble name
and a big bag of gold

888
00:49:23,545 --> 00:49:26,105
can buy you a lot.
All that's gone now.

889
00:49:26,265 --> 00:49:29,785
He's totally at the mercy
of the people he's travelling with.

890
00:49:29,945 --> 00:49:30,835
Who are you?

891
00:49:30,846 --> 00:49:33,515
- <i>And then the unthinkable happens.</i>
- I am the gift.

892
00:49:33,665 --> 00:49:36,945
<i>He's captured and handed over
to his family's greatest enemy,</i>

893
00:49:37,105 --> 00:49:39,625
<i>the Targaryen
queen in waiting, Daenerys.</i>

894
00:49:39,745 --> 00:49:42,065
My name is Tyrion Lannister.

895
00:49:43,025 --> 00:49:47,425
And between them,
they are an extraordinary force.

896
00:49:47,585 --> 00:49:48,685
Protect your queen!

897
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:51,300
<i>She appoints him as
her political adviser.</i>

898
00:49:51,385 --> 00:49:55,145
<i>But when a civil rebellion begins,
Tyrion gets to witness Daenerys</i>

899
00:49:55,265 --> 00:49:58,345
<i>transform into a true Targaryen.</i>

900
00:49:58,505 --> 00:50:02,745
The symbol of the Targaryens
coming to claim their power

901
00:50:02,905 --> 00:50:06,545
is on the back of a dragon because,
I mean, there's not much you can do

902
00:50:06,705 --> 00:50:10,145
when you're standing on the ground
and a dragon's coming at you.

903
00:50:15,105 --> 00:50:17,625
Daenerys has had the dragons
now for quite some time now

904
00:50:17,785 --> 00:50:22,425
but that moment she gets on Drogon
and rides him for the first time,

905
00:50:22,545 --> 00:50:24,465
that is her claiming her birthright.

906
00:50:25,625 --> 00:50:28,625
The dragon riders are what
the Targaryens are all about.

907
00:50:28,785 --> 00:50:30,665
That is how they
wielded their power.

908
00:50:30,825 --> 00:50:35,065
Everybody
painted that picture of Daenerys

909
00:50:35,225 --> 00:50:37,385
flying her dragon,
it never really happened.

910
00:50:37,545 --> 00:50:40,705
And they've waited so many years
to see that and she finally does

911
00:50:40,865 --> 00:50:44,185
and she does it in a wicked way
where she's escaping death.

912
00:50:45,945 --> 00:50:48,665
Daenerys, she's got
the greatest name ever.

913
00:50:48,785 --> 00:50:51,305
Stormborn, Mother of Dragons.

914
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:54,545
Daenerys Stormborn Targaryen,
I love that name.

915
00:50:54,705 --> 00:50:58,105
She's got these dragons as back-up
and then she's got Tyrion,

916
00:50:58,225 --> 00:51:00,305
who knows King's Landing,

917
00:51:00,465 --> 00:51:02,825
who knows the political
side of things

918
00:51:02,985 --> 00:51:04,865
and he's been
through battles as well.

919
00:51:04,985 --> 00:51:07,105
Yet, as season five ends,

920
00:51:07,265 --> 00:51:10,865
Daenerys's dragon delivers
her to an uncertain fate.

921
00:51:12,385 --> 00:51:14,185
The last thing we see
of her in season five,

922
00:51:14,345 --> 00:51:16,385
surrounded by Dothraki,
back where she started.

923
00:51:21,185 --> 00:51:24,425
And season five is one
of vengeance for Arya.

924
00:51:24,585 --> 00:51:28,545
The young Stark follows her mentor
to Braavos to become an assassin.

925
00:51:28,705 --> 00:51:32,425
To serve well,
a girl must become no-one.

926
00:51:32,585 --> 00:51:36,225
Arya's relationship
with Jaqen is fascinating.

927
00:51:36,345 --> 00:51:38,905
He is utterly mysterious

928
00:51:39,025 --> 00:51:44,545
and she is seduced by his power.

929
00:51:44,665 --> 00:51:47,185
I didn't come here to sweep floors.

930
00:51:47,305 --> 00:51:50,425
No? Why come then?

931
00:51:50,545 --> 00:51:52,825
You said I could be your apprentice.

932
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:56,105
The power of death,
the power to choose who dies.

933
00:51:56,265 --> 00:51:59,545
And Arya uses her new skills
to slaughter Meryn Trant,

934
00:51:59,705 --> 00:52:02,505
a name on her kill list of people
who have destroyed her world.

935
00:52:02,665 --> 00:52:05,345
- Argh!
- Arya's just a wee assassin.

936
00:52:05,465 --> 00:52:07,385
Argh! Argh!

937
00:52:07,545 --> 00:52:12,185
She made him suffer
in the best way possible

938
00:52:12,305 --> 00:52:14,305
and she thoroughly enjoyed it.

939
00:52:14,465 --> 00:52:17,985
But you must remember
what Arya has been through.

940
00:52:18,145 --> 00:52:22,945
There is a sense of vengeance
rather than a sense of justice.

941
00:52:23,065 --> 00:52:25,385
As Arya explores vengeance,

942
00:52:25,545 --> 00:52:28,865
back home, the battle is on
for the Stark family home.

943
00:52:29,025 --> 00:52:31,305
Stannis Baratheon
is marching on Winterfell,

944
00:52:31,425 --> 00:52:33,345
now held by the Boltons.

945
00:52:34,505 --> 00:52:37,625
But sometimes sacrifices
must be made to ensure victory.

946
00:52:37,785 --> 00:52:43,465
He's going after something and it
is... it's increasingly futile.

947
00:52:43,625 --> 00:52:46,145
In a desperate move,
Stannis follows the advice

948
00:52:46,305 --> 00:52:48,545
of a red priestess
who promises him victory

949
00:52:48,705 --> 00:52:51,945
if he makes an unspeakable
offering to the Lord of Light.

950
00:52:52,105 --> 00:52:54,825
She managed to convince him
to burn his own daughter.

951
00:52:54,985 --> 00:52:57,865
That's one of the most chilling
scenes, I think, of season five,

952
00:52:57,985 --> 00:53:01,425
when... when he burns his child.

953
00:53:01,585 --> 00:53:05,265
She's believed in this god
for so many years, I think that

954
00:53:05,425 --> 00:53:08,425
if it's not to do with the god, she
kind of just blocks everything out

955
00:53:08,585 --> 00:53:11,065
and I think that's what happened
as she blocked out the fact

956
00:53:11,225 --> 00:53:13,345
that she was going
to be sacrificing a child.

957
00:53:13,505 --> 00:53:15,385
She was sacrificing
the king's blood.

958
00:53:16,785 --> 00:53:20,345
Melisandre really did believe that
Stannis was going to be the one

959
00:53:20,505 --> 00:53:23,945
who would bring everything together
and he was going to be the ruler

960
00:53:24,105 --> 00:53:26,665
of the Seven Kingdoms and she
put a lot of her heart and soul

961
00:53:26,825 --> 00:53:30,465
- into helping him.
- <i>But it proves to be his undoing.</i>

962
00:53:30,625 --> 00:53:33,825
<i>His men desert him and Melisandre,
realising all is lost,</i>

963
00:53:33,985 --> 00:53:36,385
- <i>flees to Castle Black...</i>
- Your grace.

964
00:53:36,545 --> 00:53:38,905
<i>...leaving Stannis to advance
to Winterfell on his own.</i>

965
00:53:39,065 --> 00:53:41,745
Speak up.
It can't be worse than mutiny.

966
00:53:41,905 --> 00:53:43,785
He's had a rough old time,
Stannis, hasn't he?

967
00:53:43,945 --> 00:53:47,385
Because really he should be the king
from after Robert Baratheon dies

968
00:53:47,545 --> 00:53:51,385
but every battle, he loses he
becomes further and further

969
00:53:51,505 --> 00:53:53,785
involved with this kind of fantasy.

970
00:53:53,945 --> 00:53:57,265
And awaiting Stannis
at Winterfell are the Boltons,

971
00:53:57,425 --> 00:53:59,505
who tried to cement
their position in the North

972
00:53:59,665 --> 00:54:01,545
with a tactical marriage
to Sansa Stark,

973
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:04,945
orchestrated by master
manipulator Petyr Baelish.

974
00:54:05,105 --> 00:54:07,225
She shouldn't trust Littlefinger,
I mean,

975
00:54:07,385 --> 00:54:10,025
why are you gonna trust
Littlefinger, I mean, jeez!

976
00:54:10,185 --> 00:54:13,505
He is the dodgy car
salesman in Game Of Thrones,

977
00:54:13,665 --> 00:54:16,705
offers you everything
and gives you nothing.

978
00:54:16,865 --> 00:54:20,465
May I introduce my son,
Ramsay Bolton.

979
00:54:21,785 --> 00:54:24,745
Now the Boltons have established
themselves at Winterfell,

980
00:54:24,905 --> 00:54:29,385
bringing in a Stark will solidify
their position in the North.

981
00:54:29,505 --> 00:54:31,425
But it's a huge miscalculation

982
00:54:31,585 --> 00:54:34,185
that traps her in another
brutal relationship.

983
00:54:34,345 --> 00:54:39,465
Ramsay is a horrible, cruel,
evil, power-hungry man.

984
00:54:39,625 --> 00:54:43,225
He took psychotic nature
to another level.

985
00:54:43,385 --> 00:54:45,385
I mean, he went there,
and he went some.

986
00:54:45,505 --> 00:54:47,265
Oh, no, no, no.

987
00:54:47,385 --> 00:54:50,225
You stay here, Reek.

988
00:54:50,385 --> 00:54:52,265
You watch.

989
00:54:52,425 --> 00:54:57,145
Fellow prisoner Theon Greyjoy,
aka Reek, is too terrified to help.

990
00:54:57,345 --> 00:55:01,065
I think we all thought he should have stepped
in on the wedding night, let's be frank.

991
00:55:01,225 --> 00:55:04,025
- <i>With Ramsay distracted by battle...</i>
- You're leaving it to me?

992
00:55:04,185 --> 00:55:06,105
<i>...Sansa is caught
attempting to escape</i>

993
00:55:06,265 --> 00:55:09,905
<i>and it's only then that Reek finds
the courage to become Theon again.</i>

994
00:55:10,825 --> 00:55:14,865
- Ugh!
- Stop! Ugh!

995
00:55:15,025 --> 00:55:17,145
That was a moment we all
needed to see. Theon again

996
00:55:17,305 --> 00:55:19,905
had been so much
at the mercy of Ramsey

997
00:55:20,065 --> 00:55:23,785
that finally he had a moment
where he could do good.

998
00:55:23,905 --> 00:55:26,265
And so, by the end of season five,

999
00:55:26,425 --> 00:55:29,705
Sansa has jumped either to
her death or to her freedom.

1000
00:55:31,265 --> 00:55:36,785
It's someone being
pushed in every way

1001
00:55:36,945 --> 00:55:40,705
to the absolute limit
of their will to live

1002
00:55:40,825 --> 00:55:45,025
and having come through that,

1003
00:55:45,185 --> 00:55:48,945
she's obviously gonna be
quite a different person.

1004
00:55:49,105 --> 00:55:53,345
As Sansa and Theon leap
from the walls of Winterfell,

1005
00:55:53,505 --> 00:55:57,425
nearby, Stannis is facing
defeat by the vast Bolton army.

1006
00:55:59,785 --> 00:56:01,905
I think Stannis had given up.
I think even before

1007
00:56:02,065 --> 00:56:04,585
they'd gone into battle,
I think he was going there to die.

1008
00:56:04,745 --> 00:56:08,265
Fate finally catches up with Stannis
when he comes face to face

1009
00:56:08,425 --> 00:56:10,505
with Brienne of Tarth
who's sought vengeance

1010
00:56:10,625 --> 00:56:13,025
for Renly's death since season two.

1011
00:56:13,185 --> 00:56:19,145
She is probably the toughest person
going about... about Westeros.

1012
00:56:27,385 --> 00:56:28,665
Argh!

1013
00:56:28,785 --> 00:56:30,705
But as Stannis bows out,

1014
00:56:30,865 --> 00:56:34,625
Jon Snow comes up against a greater
foe when he ventures to Hardhome

1015
00:56:34,745 --> 00:56:36,745
to make peace with the Wildlings.

1016
00:56:36,905 --> 00:56:39,705
This alliance is sacrilege
but when the White Walkers

1017
00:56:39,865 --> 00:56:42,865
launch a full attack,
Jon sees his hunch is right.

1018
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:46,625
All humans must unite to fight them.

1019
00:56:46,785 --> 00:56:49,105
What's so great about the
whole White Walker mythology

1020
00:56:49,265 --> 00:56:51,745
is the way it has been building
throughout the series.

1021
00:56:51,865 --> 00:56:54,185
Who knows what they want?

1022
00:56:54,345 --> 00:56:56,225
They would bring
death and destruction

1023
00:56:56,345 --> 00:56:58,945
to absolutely everything.

1024
00:57:02,145 --> 00:57:05,105
Up until this point, they've
been semi-mythical characters.

1025
00:57:05,265 --> 00:57:07,425
It's been the White Walkers
in those cold lands

1026
00:57:07,545 --> 00:57:09,465
that no-one ever goes to

1027
00:57:09,625 --> 00:57:13,385
and here they are in front of the
heroes and they're very real

1028
00:57:13,505 --> 00:57:15,705
and it's a very real danger.

1029
00:57:17,825 --> 00:57:20,905
I don't think the White Walkers
are afraid of anything.

1030
00:57:21,065 --> 00:57:25,545
I think fear is just
not in their vocabulary.

1031
00:57:27,425 --> 00:57:30,265
And then Jon and the viewers
see the Night King reveal

1032
00:57:30,385 --> 00:57:32,305
that he has a greater power.

1033
00:57:33,345 --> 00:57:36,145
He can raise and recruit the dead.

1034
00:57:38,585 --> 00:57:41,625
It's a challenge to Jon
and, 'Look what I can do.'

1035
00:57:44,785 --> 00:57:47,305
Forget all the other
battles that are going on,

1036
00:57:47,465 --> 00:57:51,105
you know, battles for castles
and kingship, you know.

1037
00:57:51,225 --> 00:57:53,265
He's got to focus his army.

1038
00:57:53,385 --> 00:57:55,665
But on Jon's return to Castle Black,

1039
00:57:55,785 --> 00:57:57,745
in the final minutes of season five,

1040
00:57:57,905 --> 00:58:00,225
viewers witness
the cruellest blow of all

1041
00:58:00,345 --> 00:58:02,265
in a gut-churning finale.

1042
00:58:02,425 --> 00:58:06,585
When I saw the cross with traitor
written on it, I thought, 'Oh, no,

1043
00:58:06,705 --> 00:58:08,905
'they're not gonna kill him.'

1044
00:58:09,025 --> 00:58:11,505
And then they did!

1045
00:58:14,505 --> 00:58:16,425
For the Watch.

1046
00:58:16,585 --> 00:58:19,305
You root for him but the great
thing about Game Of Thrones is

1047
00:58:19,425 --> 00:58:21,345
your heroes can die at any second.

1048
00:58:25,305 --> 00:58:27,545
For the Watch.

1049
00:58:27,705 --> 00:58:29,585
They're all members
of the Night's Watch

1050
00:58:29,745 --> 00:58:32,505
and no matter what
one of their brothers has done,

1051
00:58:32,665 --> 00:58:35,825
what they did was
worse than what he did.

1052
00:58:35,985 --> 00:58:40,145
And so season five
ends on betrayal and death.

1053
00:58:40,265 --> 00:58:42,545
Is this really the end for Jon Snow?

1054
00:58:48,865 --> 00:58:51,825
Season six begins
at the scene of a crime.

1055
00:58:51,945 --> 00:58:54,905
Jon Snow lies slain at Castle Black

1056
00:58:55,065 --> 00:58:57,185
and all hopes are pinned
on the red priestess

1057
00:58:57,305 --> 00:58:59,465
and her magic to bring him back.

1058
00:59:00,625 --> 00:59:02,865
Game Of Thrones needs Jon Snow.

1059
00:59:03,025 --> 00:59:06,785
We do, we need him
to finish what he started.

1060
00:59:06,945 --> 00:59:09,305
As viewers hope
for Jon's resurrection,

1061
00:59:09,465 --> 00:59:13,185
we learn that Melisandre
harbours a great secret.

1062
00:59:13,345 --> 00:59:16,385
The reveal of ancient Melisandre
was definitely one of the most

1063
00:59:16,545 --> 00:59:19,145
stunning surprises in season
six of Game Of Thrones.

1064
00:59:20,425 --> 00:59:22,865
It shows how much
older she actually is

1065
00:59:23,025 --> 00:59:26,305
and how much longer she's been
believing in this god for.

1066
00:59:26,465 --> 00:59:30,225
Then we see her
use this power for Jon.

1067
00:59:30,385 --> 00:59:33,345
She tries to bring him back to us,
to resurrect him, it doesn't work.

1068
00:59:33,505 --> 00:59:36,665
When the wolf started
to sort of make some noise,

1069
00:59:36,825 --> 00:59:40,705
that's when I thought... I think
everyone thought Jon Snow's alive.

1070
00:59:40,865 --> 00:59:43,345
And then it's just that moment of...

1071
00:59:43,505 --> 00:59:47,625
Jon Snow has returned and all
of Westeros rejoices.

1072
00:59:47,785 --> 00:59:50,305
And after the miracle
of Jon's rebirth

1073
00:59:50,465 --> 00:59:53,185
comes a partial reunion
of scattered Starks

1074
00:59:53,305 --> 00:59:55,305
when Sansa arrives at Castle Black

1075
00:59:55,465 --> 00:59:59,065
and together they'll gather forces
in a bid to retake the North.

1076
01:00:02,985 --> 01:00:07,745
Sansa's become majestic
but she's also become savvy.

1077
01:00:07,865 --> 01:00:09,785
She's lost that naivety.

1078
01:00:09,945 --> 01:00:14,345
A monster has taken
our home and our brother.

1079
01:00:15,425 --> 01:00:18,305
We have to go back to
Winterfell and save them both.

1080
01:00:18,425 --> 01:00:20,545
She's a queen, really.

1081
01:00:20,745 --> 01:00:23,425
In terms of being
from a powerful family

1082
01:00:23,585 --> 01:00:26,385
and being able to make decisions
and tell other people to do stuff,

1083
01:00:26,545 --> 01:00:28,625
I think she's gonna tell
other people to do stuff.

1084
01:00:28,785 --> 01:00:32,105
As one former Bolton
captive looks for revenge,

1085
01:00:32,225 --> 01:00:34,145
another looks for redemption.

1086
01:00:34,265 --> 01:00:36,185
I am Theon Greyjoy.

1087
01:00:37,225 --> 01:00:39,425
Last living son of Balon Greyjoy.

1088
01:00:39,585 --> 01:00:42,385
Theon returns again
to the Iron Islands.

1089
01:00:42,545 --> 01:00:45,025
But, following his
father's mysterious death,

1090
01:00:45,145 --> 01:00:47,065
renounces his claim.

1091
01:00:47,225 --> 01:00:51,465
- And she is your rightful ruler.
- Aye!

1092
01:00:51,625 --> 01:00:55,705
Theon, by backing Yara,
shows that he's learnt

1093
01:00:55,865 --> 01:01:00,305
from his massive fall
and humiliation and castration

1094
01:01:00,465 --> 01:01:04,465
and he's learnt
who is the more powerful person.

1095
01:01:04,585 --> 01:01:08,785
Yara! Yara! Yara! Yara!

1096
01:01:08,905 --> 01:01:10,705
I'm Euron Greyjoy.

1097
01:01:10,825 --> 01:01:13,745
I claim the Salt Throne.

1098
01:01:13,905 --> 01:01:18,305
But it's not all plain sailing
for Yara. Her uncle Euron arrives

1099
01:01:18,465 --> 01:01:21,065
and immediately
scuppers her plan to rule.

1100
01:01:22,185 --> 01:01:25,745
Euron comes in and we know
he's killed the father

1101
01:01:25,905 --> 01:01:29,985
and Yara announces
that he's killed the father

1102
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:32,025
and you think that's
gonna be the end of him.

1103
01:01:32,185 --> 01:01:34,425
He led us into
two wars we couldn't win.

1104
01:01:34,585 --> 01:01:38,545
I apologise to you all
for not killing him years ago.

1105
01:01:38,705 --> 01:01:43,545
He is just
the most insane creation.

1106
01:01:43,665 --> 01:01:45,785
He's cocky, he's arrogant.

1107
01:01:45,945 --> 01:01:48,185
He could start a fight
in an empty room.

1108
01:01:48,305 --> 01:01:50,345
I wasn't born to be king.

1109
01:01:50,505 --> 01:01:54,985
I paid the iron price
and here I stand.

1110
01:01:55,105 --> 01:01:58,305
Euron! Euron!

1111
01:01:58,465 --> 01:02:01,025
All the men will still
side with a another man

1112
01:02:01,185 --> 01:02:04,585
because he's shown such
ruthlessness and cunning.

1113
01:02:04,705 --> 01:02:07,105
With Euron crowned king,

1114
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:10,625
Theon and Yara flee,
taking part of the fleet with them.

1115
01:02:10,745 --> 01:02:12,985
They stole our best ships.

1116
01:02:13,145 --> 01:02:18,385
They are headed across the
Narrow Sea to join Daenerys

1117
01:02:18,505 --> 01:02:21,105
who's been a hostage of the Dothraki.

1118
01:02:22,305 --> 01:02:25,585
But now burns their leaders
and converts the tribe.

1119
01:02:27,865 --> 01:02:29,905
The huge Dothraki horde.

1120
01:02:33,745 --> 01:02:39,745
We're gonna finally get a lot
of different power factions

1121
01:02:39,905 --> 01:02:43,065
coming together
in a very scary explosive way.

1122
01:02:43,185 --> 01:02:45,905
And she bags herself a navy

1123
01:02:46,065 --> 01:02:49,465
by forging an alliance with Yara
who pledges her fleet of ships.

1124
01:02:50,545 --> 01:02:53,585
But as Great Houses unite for war,

1125
01:02:53,745 --> 01:02:56,145
beyond the Wall, we learn
more about the deathly foe

1126
01:02:56,265 --> 01:02:58,185
which threatens them all.

1127
01:02:58,345 --> 01:03:00,865
While time training
with a Three-Eyed Raven,

1128
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:03,585
Bran Stark uncovers a great secret.

1129
01:03:03,745 --> 01:03:06,345
White Walkers were created
from the First Men.

1130
01:03:09,545 --> 01:03:12,665
The Children Of The Forest
invented the White Walkers

1131
01:03:12,785 --> 01:03:16,385
to help protect their own race.

1132
01:03:16,545 --> 01:03:20,705
It was an innocent
defence to do that.

1133
01:03:20,865 --> 01:03:23,945
But clearly it has
gone out of control.

1134
01:03:24,105 --> 01:03:26,385
<i>And when the White Walkers
come for Bran,</i>

1135
01:03:26,545 --> 01:03:30,305
- <i>there are terrible casualties.</i>
- Hodor is a goner.

1136
01:03:30,985 --> 01:03:35,905
- Hold the door!
- A completely pure act of protection.

1137
01:03:36,065 --> 01:03:39,225
There was nothing...
There was no greater goal

1138
01:03:39,385 --> 01:03:42,985
to what he did
other than protect Bran.

1139
01:03:44,625 --> 01:03:50,185
Everyone who's basically just given
in order to give way for Bran

1140
01:03:50,305 --> 01:03:53,905
and there must be a reason, right?

1141
01:03:54,065 --> 01:03:56,145
We know he's become
the Three-Eyed Raven.

1142
01:03:59,185 --> 01:04:01,945
But how's he going
to use those powers.

1143
01:04:02,065 --> 01:04:04,305
And as the Three-Eyed Raven,

1144
01:04:04,425 --> 01:04:06,625
Bran resolves a great Stark secret

1145
01:04:06,785 --> 01:04:10,545
when he sees Jon Snow's
mother is Ned's sister Lyanna.

1146
01:04:12,545 --> 01:04:15,185
You understand what Ned's been
going through the whole time.

1147
01:04:15,345 --> 01:04:17,545
He made out that it was his son,
his bastard son,

1148
01:04:17,665 --> 01:04:19,625
but it was really his nephew.

1149
01:04:19,785 --> 01:04:23,345
But it confirms Jon Snow
is still half Stark

1150
01:04:23,505 --> 01:04:26,705
and, in season six,
he and Sansa march

1151
01:04:26,865 --> 01:04:29,785
on their family seat of Winterfell
to fight Ramsay Bolton

1152
01:04:29,945 --> 01:04:33,625
in what goes down in history
as the Battle of the Bastards.

1153
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:40,105
Ramsay's now top dog, having murdered
his father and newborn brother.

1154
01:04:40,265 --> 01:04:43,625
If you want to say... You're going
to die tomorrow, Lord Bolton.

1155
01:04:43,785 --> 01:04:47,345
When you play the Game Of Thrones,
you either win or you die, you know,

1156
01:04:47,505 --> 01:04:49,585
and she knows
it's about winning now,

1157
01:04:49,745 --> 01:04:52,785
she's had enough of all the rest,
it's time to win.

1158
01:04:52,905 --> 01:04:55,145
She offers her insight.

1159
01:04:55,345 --> 01:04:59,065
You think he's going to fall into your
trap, he won't. He's the one who lays traps.

1160
01:04:59,225 --> 01:05:01,825
She's lived with this man
for a long time and she knows

1161
01:05:01,985 --> 01:05:06,025
that...
that he is cruel to the core.

1162
01:05:06,145 --> 01:05:08,785
Sansa's words go unheeded.

1163
01:05:08,945 --> 01:05:11,625
Ramsay baits Jon
with his hostage Rickon.

1164
01:05:11,745 --> 01:05:14,065
Run to your brother.

1165
01:05:14,225 --> 01:05:16,505
It shows a lot about
how Ramsay's mind works.

1166
01:05:17,585 --> 01:05:20,545
He's calculating, he's always
thinking about the next move.

1167
01:05:20,705 --> 01:05:24,625
You know, it's very interesting how
Machiavellian he can be as well.

1168
01:05:26,665 --> 01:05:29,825
I think everybody who was watching
that episode for the first time,

1169
01:05:29,985 --> 01:05:33,105
I think they all thought he was
probably likely going to make it.

1170
01:05:33,225 --> 01:05:34,585
Ugh! Argh!

1171
01:05:37,105 --> 01:05:39,025
It was just kind of
cut so short and I think

1172
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:41,625
that's kind of what
Game Of Thrones is always about.

1173
01:05:44,225 --> 01:05:47,985
Ramsay Bolton's, like,
'Yes I've got you now, boy,

1174
01:05:48,145 --> 01:05:50,905
'just in the
middle of no-man's land.'

1175
01:05:53,105 --> 01:05:55,905
That's what Game Of Thrones
does so brilliantly,

1176
01:05:56,065 --> 01:06:00,345
it's constantly pitting good
moral forces against bad ones

1177
01:06:00,505 --> 01:06:02,385
and you don't just win
because you're good.

1178
01:06:02,505 --> 01:06:04,265
Argh! Argh!

1179
01:06:04,425 --> 01:06:06,825
They were surrounded
by the entire army,

1180
01:06:06,945 --> 01:06:09,465
they were being driven into the mud.

1181
01:06:09,625 --> 01:06:12,385
Ramsay should have won, he was
much more conniving and cunning

1182
01:06:12,545 --> 01:06:14,985
and if it hadn't have
been for Sansa coming in

1183
01:06:15,145 --> 01:06:17,465
at the last minute,
then he probably would have won.

1184
01:06:26,545 --> 01:06:29,025
She's a strong independent woman.
She's really powerful

1185
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:31,425
and she saves the day
and I think that's brilliant.

1186
01:06:31,585 --> 01:06:37,305
This was probably their first
major victory in six years.

1187
01:06:42,905 --> 01:06:46,145
They're suddenly inside the castle.
Winterfell.

1188
01:06:47,305 --> 01:06:49,905
It seems Jon will kill Ramsay.

1189
01:06:51,025 --> 01:06:53,905
But he then leaves
Sansa to take the scalp.

1190
01:06:55,025 --> 01:06:58,745
There was only one way to kill him and
Sansa found the right way to do it.

1191
01:07:00,225 --> 01:07:04,065
She knows what she's gonna do
and she knows he deserves it.

1192
01:07:04,185 --> 01:07:06,425
All memory of you will disappear.

1193
01:07:12,745 --> 01:07:15,905
If you were face to face
with your nemesis

1194
01:07:16,065 --> 01:07:19,665
and you had the opportunity,
you'd take it.

1195
01:07:19,785 --> 01:07:22,985
Aarrgghh! Argh!

1196
01:07:23,105 --> 01:07:25,145
She's hardcore.

1197
01:07:25,305 --> 01:07:28,665
She has the makings of a Cersei.

1198
01:07:28,825 --> 01:07:30,665
The king is born!
The king is born!

1199
01:07:30,825 --> 01:07:34,025
But it's Jon Snow who becomes
king as the season ends,

1200
01:07:34,185 --> 01:07:37,985
with the Starks controlling the
North and Sansa is by his side.

1201
01:07:39,105 --> 01:07:41,065
She's a character
that will surprise people

1202
01:07:41,185 --> 01:07:43,585
because she's not what she seems.

1203
01:07:43,705 --> 01:07:46,625
And neither is Sansa's sister Arya.

1204
01:07:46,785 --> 01:07:49,745
Blinded and stabbed in her
training as a faceless man,

1205
01:07:49,905 --> 01:07:53,305
she's now back in Westeros
to deal with Walder Frey.

1206
01:07:54,425 --> 01:07:56,465
She's gone on this mad journey.

1207
01:07:57,545 --> 01:08:01,425
Arya comes in disguise,
having chopped up Walder's sons.

1208
01:08:04,425 --> 01:08:06,265
They weren't easy to carve.

1209
01:08:07,145 --> 01:08:10,305
She wanted him to see who she was.

1210
01:08:13,585 --> 01:08:17,705
The face comes off, there's a knife.
The last thing you'll ever see

1211
01:08:17,865 --> 01:08:20,065
is a Stark smiling
down at you as you die.

1212
01:08:20,585 --> 01:08:23,025
She's been caught up in it so young

1213
01:08:23,185 --> 01:08:26,225
that she's turning into
this child soldier.

1214
01:08:28,505 --> 01:08:30,785
Ugh! Ugh!

1215
01:08:30,905 --> 01:08:33,465
Revenge is a dish best taken cold.

1216
01:08:33,625 --> 01:08:37,625
I literally cannot wait now
for her and Cersei to face off.

1217
01:08:37,785 --> 01:08:40,985
In fact, Cersei elevates
revenge to an art form

1218
01:08:41,145 --> 01:08:45,505
in season six as the Lannisters fight
for their family's very survival.

1219
01:08:46,585 --> 01:08:49,385
These royal lovers
are united in grief

1220
01:08:49,545 --> 01:08:52,065
after the Sand Snakes
killed their daughter.

1221
01:08:52,225 --> 01:08:56,105
The Lannisters are all about power.
They're all about revenge.

1222
01:08:56,265 --> 01:08:58,865
We're the only ones who matter,
the only ones in this world

1223
01:08:59,025 --> 01:09:01,065
and everything
they've taken from us

1224
01:09:01,225 --> 01:09:03,105
we're going to take back and more.

1225
01:09:03,265 --> 01:09:07,265
It doesn't matter how long it takes,
they will get you back.

1226
01:09:07,425 --> 01:09:09,305
With Jaime sent away
to fight revolt,

1227
01:09:09,465 --> 01:09:13,025
Cersei is left alone to face judgment
by the Faith Militant.

1228
01:09:15,185 --> 01:09:17,905
We are told that Cersei
is going to turn up for a trial

1229
01:09:18,065 --> 01:09:20,665
but we know perfectly well
she's not going to.

1230
01:09:20,825 --> 01:09:24,505
But it's now she plays
a game-changing hand.

1231
01:09:24,665 --> 01:09:27,785
She was always going
to have a dastardly plan.

1232
01:09:28,865 --> 01:09:31,785
The man who was sent by Cersei
to hold Tommen in that room...

1233
01:09:31,945 --> 01:09:36,585
There's something wrong. Margaery
knows what's up in an instant.

1234
01:09:36,745 --> 01:09:39,745
The High Sept is packed with
those who've wronged Cersei.

1235
01:09:39,905 --> 01:09:43,105
The Tyrells, High Sparrow
and Faith Militant.

1236
01:09:43,305 --> 01:09:46,945
The amazing thing is the spectacle is
incredible and you never know it's coming.

1237
01:09:51,865 --> 01:09:53,425
This isn't gonna end well.

1238
01:09:59,465 --> 01:10:02,145
Cersei has, of course,
unleashed wildfire.

1239
01:10:02,305 --> 01:10:06,145
She's wiped out
this fantastic building,

1240
01:10:06,265 --> 01:10:08,185
she's destroyed all her enemies.

1241
01:10:08,345 --> 01:10:10,945
That's what makes
Cersei so brilliant,

1242
01:10:11,105 --> 01:10:13,225
she's been to the
absolute lowest place

1243
01:10:13,345 --> 01:10:15,265
that you could possibly go

1244
01:10:15,385 --> 01:10:17,945
and she still comes out on top.

1245
01:10:18,105 --> 01:10:22,505
In the moment where she gets
her revenge on everyone else,

1246
01:10:22,665 --> 01:10:27,585
she loses the only thing that
she has left that matters to her.

1247
01:10:30,025 --> 01:10:31,945
Knowing that his mum's
the one that's

1248
01:10:32,065 --> 01:10:33,985
pretty much murdered his wife...

1249
01:10:37,705 --> 01:10:41,145
- ...what has he got to live for?
- <i>Tommen's death</i>

1250
01:10:41,305 --> 01:10:44,985
<i>leaves the Iron Throne empty,
so a new reign begins.</i>

1251
01:10:46,225 --> 01:10:48,225
A witch told her
that she was cursed

1252
01:10:48,385 --> 01:10:50,265
and that all
of her children would die.

1253
01:10:50,425 --> 01:10:53,665
It didn't stop her from loving her
kids and trying to protect them

1254
01:10:53,785 --> 01:10:57,465
at any cost but she accepts

1255
01:10:57,585 --> 01:11:00,785
very swiftly her fate.

1256
01:11:00,945 --> 01:11:05,985
And so Jaime returns to a new world
order, courtesy of his sister.

1257
01:11:07,065 --> 01:11:10,625
She's devastated the Tyrells.

1258
01:11:10,785 --> 01:11:13,985
Now the Lannisters are once more
a force to be reckoned with.

1259
01:11:16,505 --> 01:11:18,985
Queen Cersei
sitting on the Iron Throne.

1260
01:11:22,025 --> 01:11:24,665
The fact that a woman has
managed to achieve that position

1261
01:11:24,825 --> 01:11:29,305
and get that much power, Tywin,
he would probably have been

1262
01:11:29,425 --> 01:11:31,945
reluctantly proud.

1263
01:11:32,105 --> 01:11:35,665
Then you go, 'OK, well, what are you
going to do with this Iron Throne?'

1264
01:11:35,785 --> 01:11:38,985
Jaime, he knows, not a lot of good.

1265
01:11:40,305 --> 01:11:43,785
He's wondering who she's going to
become now that she has the power.

1266
01:11:43,905 --> 01:11:46,305
As one queen takes the throne,

1267
01:11:46,465 --> 01:11:49,305
another sets sail
to challenge her for it.

1268
01:11:49,465 --> 01:11:52,705
Finally Daenerys,
the Targaryen queen,

1269
01:11:52,865 --> 01:11:55,865
is on her way to Westeros
with a vast alliance

1270
01:11:55,985 --> 01:11:58,185
she spent six seasons amassing.

1271
01:11:59,905 --> 01:12:03,225
We're now getting to crunch time.
The dragons flying overhead,

1272
01:12:03,385 --> 01:12:07,225
everybody on the boats,
'We're coming.'

1273
01:12:08,265 --> 01:12:12,465
Join us after the break
for the Targaryen invasion.

1274
01:12:22,065 --> 01:12:24,346
Welcome to Westeros where
the fight for the kingdom is on.

1275
01:12:26,145 --> 01:12:28,585
<i>Welcome back to "The Story So Far"</i>

1276
01:12:28,745 --> 01:12:32,785
<i>where, in season seven, Daenerys
finally lands on home soil,</i>

1277
01:12:32,905 --> 01:12:35,945
<i>her birthplace Dragonstone...</i>

1278
01:12:37,745 --> 01:12:40,265
<i>...along with her huge
alliance of power players.</i>

1279
01:12:40,425 --> 01:12:45,425
To see this female character rise
to power and get to the point

1280
01:12:45,585 --> 01:12:49,625
where she's commanded thousands
of men, it's so magical.

1281
01:12:49,745 --> 01:12:52,625
Her allies want immediate invasion.

1282
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:55,425
We have an army,
a fleet and three dragons.

1283
01:12:55,585 --> 01:12:59,185
We could hit King's Landing now,
hard, with everything we have.

1284
01:12:59,305 --> 01:13:01,225
The city will fall within a day.

1285
01:13:01,385 --> 01:13:04,185
Ellaria wants to take Cersei out
and all the Lannisters.

1286
01:13:04,345 --> 01:13:07,665
That's what she wants
and she feels now that her

1287
01:13:07,785 --> 01:13:10,665
and the Tyrells and the Greyjoys,

1288
01:13:10,825 --> 01:13:13,825
they're all there together,
just go and rip them out.

1289
01:13:13,850 --> 01:13:15,650
Tens of thousands will
die in the firestorm.

1290
01:13:15,660 --> 01:13:16,760
It's called war.

1291
01:13:16,825 --> 01:13:18,945
Who can win against these dragons?

1292
01:13:19,105 --> 01:13:21,345
<i>But to avoid being seen
as foreign invaders,</i>

1293
01:13:21,505 --> 01:13:24,225
<i>Daenerys's hand Tyrion
has a more cunning plan.</i>

1294
01:13:24,385 --> 01:13:26,465
You can't have
everybody hating you.

1295
01:13:26,625 --> 01:13:28,505
You've got to have
some people inside.

1296
01:13:28,665 --> 01:13:30,545
I think that's what
Tyrion is there for.

1297
01:13:30,665 --> 01:13:33,185
<i>Then comes a fateful meeting.</i>

1298
01:13:33,345 --> 01:13:36,745
<i>In need of more allies, Daenerys
summons the king in the North,</i>

1299
01:13:36,905 --> 01:13:40,305
<i>Jon Snow.
He comes but with his own agenda.</i>

1300
01:13:40,465 --> 01:13:42,785
<i>He's learned there
is dragonglass there.</i>

1301
01:13:42,905 --> 01:13:45,785
Jon's biggest goal is to prove

1302
01:13:45,905 --> 01:13:48,865
to the southern part of Westeros

1303
01:13:49,025 --> 01:13:52,905
that the Night King is real
and that this threat's coming.

1304
01:13:53,065 --> 01:13:56,665
- The dead are the enemy.
- The dead?

1305
01:13:56,825 --> 01:14:00,625
The overall battle for humanity
itself is the greater battle.

1306
01:14:00,785 --> 01:14:04,745
<i>Daenerys allows Jon to search
for this natural treasure.</i>

1307
01:14:05,985 --> 01:14:08,465
Beneath dragonstone
is more dragonglass

1308
01:14:08,625 --> 01:14:10,785
than they'll ever need
to defeat the White Walkers

1309
01:14:10,945 --> 01:14:13,345
and it is key, in fact,
to defeating the White Walkers.

1310
01:14:13,465 --> 01:14:16,185
<i>And they find ancient cave paintings.</i>

1311
01:14:16,345 --> 01:14:19,905
- The enemy is real.
- <i>Proof of White Walkers.</i>

1312
01:14:20,025 --> 01:14:21,985
It's always been real.

1313
01:14:22,145 --> 01:14:25,825
He's taking the first steps
towards convincing Daenerys

1314
01:14:25,985 --> 01:14:29,785
that that threat is real and looking
for the ally he needs to fight it.

1315
01:14:29,905 --> 01:14:31,865
I will fight for the North.

1316
01:14:35,145 --> 01:14:37,465
When you bend the knee.

1317
01:14:37,585 --> 01:14:40,225
Aware of the impending invasion,

1318
01:14:40,385 --> 01:14:43,465
in the capital Queen Cersei
is more than up for a fight,

1319
01:14:43,625 --> 01:14:46,745
amassing weapons and allies
to face down the enemy.

1320
01:14:48,225 --> 01:14:52,305
Cersei is ruthless but she's
incredibly canny and clever

1321
01:14:52,425 --> 01:14:54,345
and that's why she's lasted so long.

1322
01:14:54,505 --> 01:14:58,305
To think I listened to father
for 40 years and know nothing.

1323
01:14:59,825 --> 01:15:03,865
Cersei is very much
a chip off the old block.

1324
01:15:04,025 --> 01:15:07,625
We must stand together
if we hope to stop her.

1325
01:15:07,785 --> 01:15:10,825
The powerful Tarlys
reluctantly join them.

1326
01:15:10,985 --> 01:15:15,225
Randyll is the most successful
general in Westeros

1327
01:15:15,345 --> 01:15:18,305
and considered invincible.

1328
01:15:18,465 --> 01:15:21,585
She has three full-grown dragons,
Your Grace.

1329
01:15:21,745 --> 01:15:25,905
The same as Aegon when he
conquered the Seven Kingdoms.

1330
01:15:26,025 --> 01:15:29,265
How do you propose to stop them?

1331
01:15:29,385 --> 01:15:31,185
He acknowledges their power.

1332
01:15:31,345 --> 01:15:34,545
It's like saying, 'They've got
nuclear weapons, we don't.'

1333
01:15:35,945 --> 01:15:39,225
In fact, Cersei has
two secret new weapons.

1334
01:15:39,345 --> 01:15:41,345
A giant anti-dragon machine

1335
01:15:41,505 --> 01:15:45,185
and an approaching wildcard
with his very own fleet.

1336
01:15:46,385 --> 01:15:48,745
I love Euron Greyjoy.

1337
01:15:48,865 --> 01:15:50,785
He's set his heart on Cersei.

1338
01:15:51,985 --> 01:15:54,385
You invited the Greyjoys
to King's Landing.

1339
01:15:54,545 --> 01:15:56,825
- Not all of them.
- Well, it looks like all of them.

1340
01:15:56,985 --> 01:15:59,465
He wants power, he wants
to marry Cersei Lannister.

1341
01:15:59,585 --> 01:16:01,745
So here I am

1342
01:16:01,865 --> 01:16:03,785
with a thousand ships

1343
01:16:03,905 --> 01:16:05,745
and two good hands.

1344
01:16:05,905 --> 01:16:09,025
So, he says,
'OK, I'll bring you a present.'

1345
01:16:09,185 --> 01:16:13,225
I won't return to King's Landing
until I have that for you.

1346
01:16:13,345 --> 01:16:15,265
So he goes off with his fleet.

1347
01:16:17,505 --> 01:16:21,225
Euron... He delivers
a victory for Team Cersei,

1348
01:16:21,345 --> 01:16:23,265
knocking out her enemy's armada.

1349
01:16:23,425 --> 01:16:28,225
They get invaded
by Euron and his madness.

1350
01:16:28,345 --> 01:16:29,465
Aarrgghh!

1351
01:16:29,625 --> 01:16:32,785
So swashbuckley.
I mean, properly swashbuckley.

1352
01:16:32,945 --> 01:16:36,465
He manages to encircle Theon
and Yara's much smaller fleet.

1353
01:16:36,585 --> 01:16:39,305
And he takes Yara prisoner.

1354
01:16:39,425 --> 01:16:42,985
I have her. Come and get her.

1355
01:16:43,145 --> 01:16:46,145
Theon escapes in a really
embarrassing and cowardly way.

1356
01:16:50,825 --> 01:16:54,425
Poor Theon. I mean,
he abandons his sister.

1357
01:16:54,585 --> 01:16:58,065
Jumps overboard early on in season
seven. Theon's scared of everyone.

1358
01:16:59,945 --> 01:17:03,865
Euron also captures
Ellaria Sand and her daughter.

1359
01:17:04,025 --> 01:17:08,105
And that is the gift
Euron presents to Cersei

1360
01:17:08,265 --> 01:17:12,545
because, of course, Ellaria
murdered Cersei's daughter Myrcella.

1361
01:17:13,825 --> 01:17:16,225
I'm the prize to take back to Cersei

1362
01:17:16,385 --> 01:17:20,025
so she can get her revenge on me,
which I don't want.

1363
01:17:20,185 --> 01:17:24,225
I give you what
no other man could give.

1364
01:17:24,345 --> 01:17:26,025
Justice.

1365
01:17:26,185 --> 01:17:28,945
He's pushing and
pushing and pushing...

1366
01:17:29,065 --> 01:17:31,145
There's only one reward I want.

1367
01:17:31,305 --> 01:17:35,265
...a wedge between, you know,
these kind of star-crossed lovers.

1368
01:17:35,425 --> 01:17:37,945
You shall have
what your heart desires...

1369
01:17:39,585 --> 01:17:41,745
...when the war is won.

1370
01:17:43,945 --> 01:17:46,425
In a double bluff,
Cersei lets her enemies

1371
01:17:46,545 --> 01:17:48,825
capture her family's ancestral home.

1372
01:17:49,985 --> 01:17:53,945
So, they're able to take Casterly
Rock surprisingly easily.

1373
01:17:54,105 --> 01:17:57,225
And, of course, that puts
them a little bit on edge.

1374
01:17:57,385 --> 01:18:00,905
In fact,
it's a strategic distraction...

1375
01:18:04,185 --> 01:18:08,305
...allowing Jaime to take his army
south to conquer House Tyrell

1376
01:18:08,425 --> 01:18:10,345
and steal its fortune.

1377
01:18:11,705 --> 01:18:13,665
The Lannisters, led by Jaime,

1378
01:18:13,825 --> 01:18:16,825
have very cleverly
gone to Highgarden.

1379
01:18:17,905 --> 01:18:20,265
I remember when the Lannisters
did go to pay their debts

1380
01:18:20,425 --> 01:18:23,225
by basically stealing
a load of gold from Highgarden.

1381
01:18:24,505 --> 01:18:28,065
That is where the money is and,
of course, they owe the Iron Bank

1382
01:18:28,185 --> 01:18:29,625
not an insignificant sum.

1383
01:18:31,905 --> 01:18:33,945
And Jaime goes to confront Olenna

1384
01:18:34,105 --> 01:18:37,585
who is, you know, kind of, like,
the last Tyrell of any consequence.

1385
01:18:37,745 --> 01:18:40,745
She's almost sitting there waiting
for him, she knows what's coming.

1386
01:18:40,865 --> 01:18:41,765
How will it happen?

1387
01:18:41,772 --> 01:18:44,072
It was almost like a business
appointment, wasn't it?

1388
01:18:44,085 --> 01:18:47,585
It was like, 'Oh, hello.
And now you need to die.'

1389
01:18:49,625 --> 01:18:51,265
As a viewer, you were just winded.

1390
01:18:51,425 --> 01:18:55,905
But in her very last breath, Olenna
reveals she killed King Joffrey.

1391
01:18:56,065 --> 01:18:59,665
Tell Cersei,
I want her to know it was me.

1392
01:19:00,705 --> 01:19:04,225
Boom! You know, it's, like,

1393
01:19:04,385 --> 01:19:06,665
Game Of Thrones just delivers,
doesn't it?

1394
01:19:10,385 --> 01:19:13,145
When news of the Lannister
victories reaches Daenerys,

1395
01:19:13,305 --> 01:19:16,945
she furiously abandons Tyrion's
softly, softly strategy

1396
01:19:17,065 --> 01:19:19,785
and she finally invades Westeros.

1397
01:19:21,745 --> 01:19:25,825
She's just had enough,
she is raining down her aggression

1398
01:19:25,985 --> 01:19:28,425
on top of them.
They're coming!

1399
01:19:32,425 --> 01:19:34,665
She's tired of being,
you know, bottled up

1400
01:19:34,825 --> 01:19:38,345
and being told that she shouldn't do
this. This is who she knows she is.

1401
01:19:38,505 --> 01:19:41,345
As the Lannister and Tarly
troops are eviscerated,

1402
01:19:41,505 --> 01:19:45,265
Jaime is confronted by the true
scale of the Dragon Queen's army.

1403
01:19:45,425 --> 01:19:49,225
He has looked into the
face of the future of war

1404
01:19:49,385 --> 01:19:51,265
and they're on
the losing side of it.

1405
01:19:51,425 --> 01:19:54,385
They might have held against
the charge of the Dothraki

1406
01:19:54,545 --> 01:19:57,225
but not when you've got
a dragon flying towards you.

1407
01:20:00,185 --> 01:20:03,585
Jaime makes this absolutely
ridiculous decision

1408
01:20:03,745 --> 01:20:06,785
to have one final choice
and be the queen slayer,

1409
01:20:06,945 --> 01:20:10,265
forgetting there's a gigantic
dragon just over his shoulder.

1410
01:20:10,425 --> 01:20:13,185
After Jaime escapes,
Daenerys gives the survivors,

1411
01:20:13,345 --> 01:20:16,505
along with Randyll Tarly,
a brutal ultimatum.

1412
01:20:19,785 --> 01:20:21,745
Join her or fry.

1413
01:20:22,825 --> 01:20:26,625
Randyll is captive at this point
and resigned to his fate.

1414
01:20:26,745 --> 01:20:28,225
Step forward, my lord.

1415
01:20:28,385 --> 01:20:32,025
He's unimpressed by Daenerys
co-opting a foreign army

1416
01:20:32,185 --> 01:20:37,745
of savages and laying waste to those
that she encounters in battle.

1417
01:20:37,905 --> 01:20:41,105
- You will not kneel?
- I already have a queen.

1418
01:20:41,265 --> 01:20:45,385
She needs to stake her ground here
and she needs to make examples

1419
01:20:45,545 --> 01:20:47,585
of her enemies when they
refuse to bend the knee,

1420
01:20:47,745 --> 01:20:49,745
so that she can do
what she ultimately

1421
01:20:49,905 --> 01:20:52,145
needs to do politically
in this country.

1422
01:20:52,265 --> 01:20:53,465
Dracarys.

1423
01:20:55,665 --> 01:20:57,545
What sort of leader
will Daenerys be?

1424
01:20:57,705 --> 01:21:01,665
Will she be a fair ruler
or will she be the Mad King?

1425
01:21:02,825 --> 01:21:05,825
Away from the fighting,
the remaining Stark family

1426
01:21:05,945 --> 01:21:07,865
is reunited in season seven

1427
01:21:07,985 --> 01:21:10,505
as Bran and Arya finally make it home

1428
01:21:10,665 --> 01:21:14,305
to the delight of Sansa,
the new Lady of Winterfell.

1429
01:21:18,225 --> 01:21:20,225
They're not the
people that they were.

1430
01:21:20,345 --> 01:21:22,225
They're not the kids that had those

1431
01:21:22,385 --> 01:21:24,625
cute little wolf pups
back in series one.

1432
01:21:24,745 --> 01:21:26,105
You came home.

1433
01:21:28,945 --> 01:21:31,945
But it's not as harmonious
as one would hope.

1434
01:21:32,105 --> 01:21:34,065
They haven't been together
for so long and they

1435
01:21:34,225 --> 01:21:36,105
viewed the past in
entirely different ways.

1436
01:21:36,265 --> 01:21:39,065
I remember you standing on that
platform with Joffrey and Cersei

1437
01:21:39,225 --> 01:21:41,105
when they dragged
father to the block.

1438
01:21:41,265 --> 01:21:45,265
They are sisters but they could,
in a blink, become sworn enemies.

1439
01:21:45,425 --> 01:21:48,585
You should be
on your knees thanking me.

1440
01:21:48,745 --> 01:21:52,305
We're standing in Winterfell
again because of me.

1441
01:21:52,465 --> 01:21:56,945
We were expecting sisterly love
and tears and all of that.

1442
01:21:57,105 --> 01:21:58,985
It was quite the opposite of that,
wasn't it?

1443
01:21:59,145 --> 01:22:03,185
And in the shadows, Littlefinger
is stoking the tension between them.

1444
01:22:03,305 --> 01:22:04,785
What do you think she's after?

1445
01:22:04,945 --> 01:22:07,385
You think, 'Is this all going
to implode from the inside?'

1446
01:22:07,505 --> 01:22:09,745
You stand accused of murder.

1447
01:22:09,865 --> 01:22:12,505
You stand accused of treason.

1448
01:22:12,625 --> 01:22:14,745
How do you answer these charges...

1449
01:22:17,505 --> 01:22:19,905
...Lord Baelish?

1450
01:22:20,065 --> 01:22:22,825
But it all backfires
for the arch schemer

1451
01:22:22,985 --> 01:22:26,025
as he's finally outwitted
and beaten at his own game.

1452
01:22:26,945 --> 01:22:31,065
The youngest wolves of the pack
have found their way to unite

1453
01:22:31,185 --> 01:22:33,265
and use all their skills together.

1454
01:22:33,425 --> 01:22:36,985
None of you knows the truth.
You've held a knife to his throat.

1455
01:22:37,145 --> 01:22:42,105
Bran has now been replaced
by this Three-Eyed Raven...

1456
01:22:42,265 --> 01:22:44,465
You said,
'I did warn you not to trust me.'

1457
01:22:44,625 --> 01:22:47,745
...who is this all-seeing,
all-knowing,

1458
01:22:47,865 --> 01:22:50,545
kind of slightly sinister power.

1459
01:22:50,705 --> 01:22:53,985
He just didn't see it.
He is the puppeteer.

1460
01:22:54,145 --> 01:22:57,225
I was expecting him
to be much more clever.

1461
01:22:57,385 --> 01:23:00,905
Turn family against family,
turn sister against sister,

1462
01:23:01,065 --> 01:23:03,105
that's what you did
to our mother and Aunt Lysa.

1463
01:23:03,265 --> 01:23:05,145
And that's what
you tried to do to us.

1464
01:23:05,305 --> 01:23:08,785
He's got his comeuppance...
..at the hand of Ned's kids.

1465
01:23:14,665 --> 01:23:18,105
And even farther north,
a vital quest has begun.

1466
01:23:18,265 --> 01:23:21,185
In order to unite the warring
kingdoms of Westeros against

1467
01:23:21,345 --> 01:23:24,745
the true enemy heading their way,
Jon Snow leads a mission

1468
01:23:24,865 --> 01:23:26,785
beyond the wall.

1469
01:23:26,945 --> 01:23:30,745
It's their plan to go north,
capture a wight...

1470
01:23:32,785 --> 01:23:35,825
...and bring it down south
and just show people

1471
01:23:35,985 --> 01:23:38,625
for once and for all
that there is this threat.

1472
01:23:39,825 --> 01:23:42,105
After bagging a wight,
they are surrounded.

1473
01:23:45,985 --> 01:23:50,385
And it falls on Daenerys and
her dragons to fly to the rescue.

1474
01:23:50,505 --> 01:23:52,785
She's there to save Jon.

1475
01:23:54,025 --> 01:23:56,625
There's a mad battle
raging on all sides

1476
01:23:56,785 --> 01:24:00,505
but the moment the Night King just
very slowly picks up an ice spear...

1477
01:24:01,865 --> 01:24:03,825
Ugh!

1478
01:24:03,945 --> 01:24:06,185
This is a pretty massive moment.

1479
01:24:11,705 --> 01:24:14,065
Not only does he kill the dragon...

1480
01:24:18,185 --> 01:24:21,665
...the Night King has gained one of
the most powerful weapons imaginable.

1481
01:24:21,825 --> 01:24:25,625
They escape with
a captive wight in tow

1482
01:24:25,745 --> 01:24:27,945
but it comes at a great cost

1483
01:24:28,105 --> 01:24:31,825
as the Army of the Dead
swarm in to claim their prize.

1484
01:24:33,225 --> 01:24:36,105
When he kills the dragon, you're
devastated. You think that's it.

1485
01:24:38,745 --> 01:24:42,225
When he revives the dragon
and it becomes one of them,

1486
01:24:42,385 --> 01:24:46,185
it's more than a turnaround,
it's pretty devastating.

1487
01:24:52,545 --> 01:24:55,185
Which leads to a dramatic reveal

1488
01:24:55,345 --> 01:24:59,065
as Daenerys and Jon bring their
deadly evidence down to the capital.

1489
01:24:59,225 --> 01:25:02,265
Against the odds,
Jaime's persuaded Cersei to meet

1490
01:25:02,425 --> 01:25:05,865
her enemies at a peace summit.
They plan to beg her for a truce

1491
01:25:06,025 --> 01:25:08,265
and to join the fight
against the dead.

1492
01:25:09,345 --> 01:25:11,825
Cersei and Daenerys coming
face to face for the first time

1493
01:25:11,985 --> 01:25:14,265
that's, you know,
the clash of titans.

1494
01:25:21,385 --> 01:25:23,545
There are so many
of them at play there.

1495
01:25:23,705 --> 01:25:25,905
You've got the Greyjoys,
you've got the Lannisters.

1496
01:25:26,945 --> 01:25:28,905
And suddenly Euron is so volatile.

1497
01:25:29,065 --> 01:25:31,945
- We are all facing a unique...
- Theon!

1498
01:25:32,105 --> 01:25:36,265
I have your sister.
If you don't submit to me here now,

1499
01:25:36,385 --> 01:25:38,585
I'll kill her.

1500
01:25:38,705 --> 01:25:40,625
When there's that first face-off,

1501
01:25:40,785 --> 01:25:43,065
you've got Cersei
and Daenerys over here.

1502
01:25:43,225 --> 01:25:46,825
- You have my word.
- The word of a would-be usurper.

1503
01:25:46,985 --> 01:25:51,425
There is no conversation that
will erase the last 50 years.

1504
01:25:52,745 --> 01:25:54,585
We have something to show you.

1505
01:25:54,705 --> 01:25:56,585
When the Hound releases the wight...

1506
01:25:57,585 --> 01:26:01,025
And the dead come out
and go straight for Cersei.

1507
01:26:04,425 --> 01:26:07,545
...it is the visceral payoff
that we've all been waiting for

1508
01:26:07,705 --> 01:26:10,625
and it is the theatrics
that Jon and Tyrion intend.

1509
01:26:10,785 --> 01:26:13,585
This is the only thing I've
ever seen that terrifies me.

1510
01:26:13,745 --> 01:26:16,065
It seems Euron Greyjoy
is turning tail

1511
01:26:16,185 --> 01:26:18,105
and deserting his queen.

1512
01:26:18,265 --> 01:26:20,825
They call your bluff,
they don't actually have anyone

1513
01:26:20,985 --> 01:26:24,225
get killed in that scene,
it becomes something else entirely.

1514
01:26:24,250 --> 01:26:25,750
A darkness is
coming for us all.

1515
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:28,060
<i>And Cersei appears
to support a truce.</i>

1516
01:26:28,145 --> 01:26:30,065
We'll face it together.

1517
01:26:30,225 --> 01:26:32,145
When she agrees,
you just think, 'Oh,

1518
01:26:32,305 --> 01:26:34,705
'this is just going
to go horribly wrong.'

1519
01:26:34,825 --> 01:26:36,745
In fact, nothing is as it seems.

1520
01:26:36,905 --> 01:26:39,945
We'll meet at Lord Harroway's Town
and march together to Winterfell.

1521
01:26:40,105 --> 01:26:42,705
- Ser Jaime.
- Your Grace.

1522
01:26:42,865 --> 01:26:45,825
He's organising the troops,
saying, 'We're going to go north,

1523
01:26:45,985 --> 01:26:48,705
'we're going to help people out,
let's get it together.'

1524
01:26:48,865 --> 01:26:51,465
And then she's, like, 'You're stupid.
We're not doing that.'

1525
01:26:51,625 --> 01:26:53,785
Do you really think
Euron Greyjoy will turn tail

1526
01:26:53,905 --> 01:26:55,425
and sail back to the Iron Islands?

1527
01:26:55,585 --> 01:26:59,185
You see Cersei not sending
the Lannister troops

1528
01:26:59,345 --> 01:27:04,265
but instead sending Euron Greyjoy
down to Essos for the mercenaries.

1529
01:27:04,385 --> 01:27:06,105
You plotted with Euron Greyjoy?

1530
01:27:06,225 --> 01:27:08,705
She will stop at nothing Cersei.

1531
01:27:08,865 --> 01:27:11,865
Even though Cersei
has revealed she's pregnant

1532
01:27:12,025 --> 01:27:16,905
with a Lannister baby to bolster
their dynasty, Jaime now leaves her.

1533
01:27:17,065 --> 01:27:20,385
Those Lannisters, man. They have
a complicated relationship.

1534
01:27:21,425 --> 01:27:24,785
He's a man of honour and, in the end,
he's going to be true to his word.

1535
01:27:26,985 --> 01:27:29,465
As one incestuous pairing
hits the rocks,

1536
01:27:29,585 --> 01:27:31,505
another is setting sail.

1537
01:27:32,865 --> 01:27:34,985
Jon has now bent the knee to Daenerys

1538
01:27:35,145 --> 01:27:37,265
and they can
no longer deny their love.

1539
01:27:39,625 --> 01:27:43,545
It's almost like seeing
a god and a goddess.

1540
01:27:44,985 --> 01:27:47,145
You've been wanting
them to become lovers

1541
01:27:47,305 --> 01:27:51,225
and you get the loving moment as
you're totally given the information

1542
01:27:51,385 --> 01:27:53,945
that you're
watching incest right now.

1543
01:27:54,105 --> 01:27:56,865
In fact, Jon's fallen
for his own auntie.

1544
01:27:57,025 --> 01:28:00,505
In a vision, Bran sees that Jon's
father is Dany's older brother

1545
01:28:00,625 --> 01:28:02,545
Rhaegar Targaryen.

1546
01:28:02,705 --> 01:28:05,865
Prince Rhaegar married Lyanna Stark
in a secret ceremony,

1547
01:28:06,025 --> 01:28:09,545
which makes Jon Aegon Targaryen's
true heir to the throne.

1548
01:28:09,665 --> 01:28:11,585
He's never been a bastard.

1549
01:28:15,825 --> 01:28:17,785
He's the heir to the Iron Throne.

1550
01:28:17,945 --> 01:28:22,225
Even if culturally
Game Of Thrones can handle incest,

1551
01:28:22,385 --> 01:28:26,465
you know Jon and Daenerys probably
won't be able to handle that.

1552
01:28:29,145 --> 01:28:32,425
But eclipsing all developments
and personal struggles,

1553
01:28:32,585 --> 01:28:36,625
in the North, the season ends
on a cataclysmic event

1554
01:28:36,785 --> 01:28:41,905
that changes the game
for every living human being.

1555
01:28:42,025 --> 01:28:43,945
This is the moment that we were told

1556
01:28:44,105 --> 01:28:47,025
could never happen.
The Wall can never come down.

1557
01:28:47,185 --> 01:28:51,705
You see the army
kind of coming out of the forest.

1558
01:28:54,505 --> 01:28:56,825
And then you hear something.

1559
01:28:58,945 --> 01:29:02,145
Oh, that's just changed
the whole ballgame here.

1560
01:29:05,865 --> 01:29:09,705
It didn't occur to me that we
would have a dragon White Walker.

1561
01:29:12,585 --> 01:29:16,505
But when that happened, you thought,
'Oh, yes, this is inevitable.'

1562
01:29:16,665 --> 01:29:19,665
Now this takes us on
a whole different journey.

1563
01:29:21,945 --> 01:29:24,985
That's when you know
it's on for next season.

1564
01:29:25,145 --> 01:29:27,705
There's nothing to protect
them in the south any more.

1565
01:29:29,465 --> 01:29:32,665
I mean, you can't have
a cliffhanger greater than that.

1566
01:29:32,825 --> 01:29:35,145
I don't know what's going
to happen but I can't wait.
