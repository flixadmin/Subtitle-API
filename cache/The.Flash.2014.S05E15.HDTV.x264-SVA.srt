1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,892
<i>My name is Barry Allen,</i>

2
00:00:01,895 --> 00:00:04,006
<i>and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

3
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:05,237
<i>To the outside world,</i>

4
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,455
<i>I'm an ordinary forensic scientist.</i>

5
00:00:07,458 --> 00:00:08,713
<i>But secretly, with the help</i>

6
00:00:08,716 --> 00:00:10,221
<i>of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

7
00:00:10,224 --> 00:00:13,303
<i>I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.</i>

8
00:00:13,306 --> 00:00:15,555
<i>But when my daughter came
back from the future to help,</i>

9
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:17,891
<i>she changed the present,</i>

10
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:20,543
<i>and now our world is
more dangerous than ever,</i>

11
00:00:20,545 --> 00:00:22,896
<i>and I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.</i>

12
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:25,529
<i>I am The Flash.</i>

13
00:00:26,437 --> 00:00:29,009
<i>Previously on "The Flash"...</i>

14
00:00:29,012 --> 00:00:30,720
<i>So what are you going to do with him?</i>

15
00:00:30,722 --> 00:00:32,111
<i>I think our time would be better served</i>

16
00:00:32,113 --> 00:00:33,236
learning how to cure him.

17
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:34,797
You should really talk to Dr. Lamden.

18
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,105
<i>Grodd's attacking him psychically.</i>

19
00:00:37,108 --> 00:00:38,228
<i>He's paralyzed.</i>

20
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,772
Human weak.

21
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,899
We could make a meta-human cure.

22
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:45,168
There's gotta be something
we could do outside the box.

23
00:00:47,556 --> 00:00:49,005
<i>You shouldn't go to your office.</i>

24
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:50,007
- Not right now.
- Why?

25
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:52,103
<i>How many times has this happened?</i>

26
00:00:52,106 --> 00:00:52,964
52.

27
00:00:52,967 --> 00:00:55,077
If I want to stop Cicada,
I can't be so precious

28
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,822
about getting The Flash's hands dirty.

29
00:00:56,825 --> 00:00:58,673
Sometimes the ends justify the means.

30
00:00:58,675 --> 00:00:59,805
I get that now.

31
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,466
Can't move.

33
00:01:28,113 --> 00:01:32,466
Ladies and gentlemen,
we finally have our hands

34
00:01:32,468 --> 00:01:35,493
on the meta-human cure.

35
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:42,458
Cool, cool. It's not like I spent weeks

36
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,052
in the frozen tundra or anything.

37
00:01:44,054 --> 00:01:48,056
No, no, no. I think that just people are

38
00:01:48,058 --> 00:01:50,341
waiting for the inevitable "but"

39
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:52,343
that follows such a big statement.

40
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:55,680
Mmm, no, it's done,
and thanks to Caitlin,

41
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:58,733
we even have a way to
deliver our silver bullet,

42
00:01:58,735 --> 00:02:01,537
so no, no "buts."

43
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:03,346
I believe there is a big "but" coming.

44
00:02:03,349 --> 00:02:06,357
But we need to test the
cure on a meta-human.

45
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,730
There it is.

46
00:02:07,733 --> 00:02:09,611
What we need is to save

47
00:02:09,613 --> 00:02:11,362
the metas that Cicada is targeting

48
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:13,490
because he's not gonna stop
killing innocent people.

49
00:02:13,493 --> 00:02:17,160
- Is the cure dangerous?
- Well, it's an untested serum

50
00:02:17,162 --> 00:02:19,030
that alters biology on a cellular level,

51
00:02:19,033 --> 00:02:21,039
so until we try it out on someone,

52
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,332
we have no way of knowing.

53
00:02:22,334 --> 00:02:24,042
When we started working on the cure,

54
00:02:24,044 --> 00:02:26,928
we decided that it would always
be a choice, not a weapon,

55
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:28,984
so all we need is a volunteer.

56
00:02:28,987 --> 00:02:30,858
Well, there's quite a conundrum, right?

57
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:33,176
A meta-human volunteer when
the meta-humans in this city

58
00:02:33,178 --> 00:02:35,178
have been chased away
by us or killed by Cicada

59
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,698
or incarcerated at Iron
Heights Prison, so...

60
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,275
Nobody from either
group is gonna volunteer.

61
00:02:40,277 --> 00:02:42,560
No, these criminals are
not going to relinquish

62
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,020
their powers, although...

63
00:02:44,022 --> 00:02:46,041
There's gotta be somebody somewhere.

64
00:02:46,044 --> 00:02:48,816
Yes, on another Earth.

65
00:02:48,818 --> 00:02:51,402
Oh, I'll call Harry, see if
there's anybody from Earth-2

66
00:02:51,404 --> 00:02:52,621
- who wants to volunteer.
- Yes.

67
00:02:52,623 --> 00:02:54,882
Not really what I was suggesting.

68
00:02:54,884 --> 00:02:56,366
Hold on, you don't have to call Harry.

69
00:02:56,368 --> 00:02:57,438
Wait, why not?

70
00:02:57,441 --> 00:03:00,244
Because there's already
a meta here from Earth-2,

71
00:03:00,247 --> 00:03:03,849
one who might not want his powers...

72
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:08,228
Although it might be pretty
difficult to talk to him.

73
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,088
King Shark...

74
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,547
You really think you can cure him?

75
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:12,707
That's the idea.

76
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,651
Oh, Lyla, this is, um...

77
00:03:15,654 --> 00:03:18,096
my daughter, Nora.

78
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:20,139
- Your daughter?
- Yeah.

79
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:22,409
- I'm from...
- The future, I'm guessing.

80
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:23,768
Weird, right?

81
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,320
No weirder than waking up one day

82
00:03:25,322 --> 00:03:29,148
to find out that your son
used to be your daughter.

83
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,825
So, why King Shark?

84
00:03:30,827 --> 00:03:34,237
Dark matter levels vary from
meta-human to meta-human,

85
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,499
but Shay Lamden's case is
the most extreme we've seen,

86
00:03:37,501 --> 00:03:39,993
so we think if we could reverse
the effects of a high level

87
00:03:39,995 --> 00:03:43,663
- mutation like his...
- You can help all metahumans.

88
00:03:43,665 --> 00:03:47,267
Look, we know King
Shark has limited speech,

89
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:50,920
but we're wondering, could
we try and talk to him?

90
00:03:50,922 --> 00:03:52,963
If we're gonna do this, we're
gonna need his permission.

91
00:03:52,965 --> 00:03:54,465
Well, you're in luck, Cisco.

92
00:03:54,474 --> 00:03:56,867
Lately, he's been quite talkative.

93
00:04:00,524 --> 00:04:03,433
<i>Look at these pictures.</i>

94
00:04:03,435 --> 00:04:06,477
- So peaceful.
- Mm.

95
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:09,456
So beautiful.

96
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:13,034
- So peaceful.
- It is, isn't it?

97
00:04:13,036 --> 00:04:16,654
You know, I never understood
why Wally went there.

98
00:04:16,656 --> 00:04:18,948
- Now I do.
- Well, it makes me wonder.

99
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:21,543
I mean, is my baby brother
ever coming back from Tibet?

100
00:04:21,545 --> 00:04:25,121
Well, all I can say is
that he is more at ease

101
00:04:25,123 --> 00:04:27,799
- than he has ever been.
- Hm.

102
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:30,168
And if that means he
wants to stay away from...

103
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,979
The crazy that is Central City,

104
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:35,173
then, you know what? So be it.

105
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:36,650
Yeah.

106
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:40,136
Well, I am glad that you're back, Dad.

107
00:04:40,138 --> 00:04:42,155
We're all glad that you're back.

108
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:43,806
Mmm.

109
00:04:43,808 --> 00:04:46,434
Even Captain Singh is
glad that you're back.

110
00:04:48,405 --> 00:04:49,687
- Wha...
- I'll get it.

111
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:51,698
No, no, no. No, you will not.

112
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,833
You will not.

113
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:54,167
You have been on crying baby duty

114
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:56,003
for far too long, Joe West.

115
00:04:57,241 --> 00:04:58,913
So happy you're back.

116
00:04:58,915 --> 00:05:00,749
All right, all right.

117
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:04,678
Are we ever gonna talk
about this couch you bought?

118
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,996
Another day, Joe. Another day.

119
00:05:06,998 --> 00:05:08,348
Very expensive.

120
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,041
I mean, it's nice. Listen.

121
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:12,168
- So, Cecile...
- Mm-hmm.

122
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,596
has brought me up to speed.

123
00:05:14,598 --> 00:05:16,881
Cicada... been very busy.

124
00:05:18,935 --> 00:05:22,178
Yeah, well...

125
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,741
You know, Team Flash will
figure out a way to beat him.

126
00:05:25,743 --> 00:05:29,675
But Jonesy was helping
him right under our nose,

127
00:05:29,678 --> 00:05:31,780
and that got me thinking,

128
00:05:31,782 --> 00:05:35,191
Cicada's eluded capture for so long

129
00:05:35,193 --> 00:05:37,786
that I'm thinking that

130
00:05:37,789 --> 00:05:40,227
he's still getting help from somebody.

131
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:44,885
I want more coffee.

132
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:46,536
I'm gonna make some more coffee.

133
00:05:46,538 --> 00:05:49,473
Yeah, I'll bring you a fresh cup.

134
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:54,544
Normally, we don't bring in
outside help but we got wind

135
00:05:54,546 --> 00:05:56,897
that the top ichthyologist in
the country was doing research

136
00:05:56,899 --> 00:05:58,973
on cases just like King Shark's.

137
00:05:58,975 --> 00:06:01,426
Actually, I think you may know her.

138
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:03,180
Dr. Lamden?

139
00:06:03,183 --> 00:06:05,012
You're working for A.R.G.U.S. now?

140
00:06:05,014 --> 00:06:07,175
Couldn't say no. And
please, call me Tanya.

141
00:06:07,178 --> 00:06:08,766
What about Nautilus Laboratories?

142
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:11,244
Director Michaels offered
me the opportunity to work

143
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,855
with another Shay Lamden,
one afflicted with the same

144
00:06:13,857 --> 00:06:16,065
dark matter anomaly as my late husband,

145
00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:18,609
only this Shay system was causing

146
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:20,995
his neural pathways to regress.

147
00:06:20,997 --> 00:06:23,114
I'm teaching him how to
communicate effectively.

148
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,646
Are you saying his mind is
becoming more shark-like?

149
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:28,035
It was, but not anymore.

150
00:06:28,037 --> 00:06:30,079
I stopped the regression
of King Shark's mind

151
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:31,923
using a cerebral interface

152
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:34,050
that stimulates his neural outputs.

153
00:06:34,052 --> 00:06:35,918
I call it a telepathic crown.

154
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,335
Kinda like the M.A.D. 2.0 we built.

155
00:06:38,338 --> 00:06:39,526
That's brilliant.

156
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:42,475
My husband, the Shay Lamden of Earth-1,

157
00:06:42,477 --> 00:06:44,185
was a wonderful man.

158
00:06:44,187 --> 00:06:47,607
Now, I have the chance to help
another Earth's Shay Lamden,

159
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:50,475
by giving him back his human mind.

160
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:52,402
And since Shay's current state

161
00:06:52,404 --> 00:06:55,146
requires him to be in the water more,

162
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:57,398
these earbuds allow me to hear him

163
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,317
under water and vice versa.

164
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:01,486
The telepathic crown
allows Tanya to get through

165
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:04,405
to King Shark and curb
his violent behavior.

166
00:07:04,407 --> 00:07:06,657
Can we use the crown to talk to him?

167
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:10,036
Yes, but why?

168
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:11,713
We think we can make him human again.

169
00:07:13,142 --> 00:07:15,550
It's taken a lot of work, but
we think we figured out a way

170
00:07:15,552 --> 00:07:17,627
to transform dark matter-infused cells

171
00:07:17,629 --> 00:07:19,170
back to their non-meta state.

172
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:21,339
Now, all we need to do is test it,

173
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:23,841
so we came looking for a volunteer.

174
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:26,052
That could really work?

175
00:07:26,054 --> 00:07:27,729
So, can we ask him?

176
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:42,169
Shay, a team from S.T.A.R. Labs is here.

177
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:44,654
They have something you may want...

178
00:07:44,656 --> 00:07:48,675
A meta-cure for your condition.

179
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:51,327
Trust me, their preliminary analysis

180
00:07:51,329 --> 00:07:53,829
on reversing meta-gene transfigurations

181
00:07:53,831 --> 00:07:56,874
proves there is a strong
chance it could work,

182
00:07:56,876 --> 00:07:59,186
especially in ichthyological prospects.

183
00:08:00,665 --> 00:08:03,356
No, I'm not just showing off.

184
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,716
It's their research.

185
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:08,561
Shay has a wonderful sense of humor.

186
00:08:08,563 --> 00:08:13,516
So, are we supposed to
call him King Shark or Shay?

187
00:08:13,518 --> 00:08:17,061
Yes, I'm still here. Uh-huh.

188
00:08:17,063 --> 00:08:19,447
I agree.

189
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:21,148
Okay.

190
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,802
You believe this cure could help?

191
00:08:40,804 --> 00:08:43,388
Yeah.

192
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,923
Where do we begin?

193
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,109
This is Agent Michaels.

194
00:08:54,112 --> 00:08:56,818
I need every available
soldier at the aquarium now!

195
00:08:59,397 --> 00:09:01,373
- Dad?
- I'm fine.

196
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:10,633
W-What was all that feedback?
I thought he was under control.

197
00:09:10,635 --> 00:09:11,690
I don't know.

198
00:09:11,693 --> 00:09:13,894
Nothing like that has
ever happened before.

199
00:09:13,897 --> 00:09:16,230
Maybe his neuroregression
finally reached the point

200
00:09:16,232 --> 00:09:18,590
where the crown could
no longer affect him.

201
00:09:18,592 --> 00:09:20,175
Shay could be lost forever.

202
00:09:20,178 --> 00:09:21,718
No, no, no. We don't know that.

203
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,068
Why don't you come to
S.T.A.R. Labs with us.

204
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,222
We can use the M.A.D. 2.0 to
boost the crown's efficiency.

205
00:09:26,225 --> 00:09:29,893
We need to find King Shark
before he hurts anyone.

206
00:09:29,895 --> 00:09:32,321
A.R.G.U.S. backup protocols
have been activated,

207
00:09:32,323 --> 00:09:33,680
but King Shark could be anywhere.

208
00:09:33,683 --> 00:09:35,249
We'll re-task the S.T.A.R. Labs satellite

209
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:38,735
to work in circuit with A.R.G.U.S.

210
00:09:38,737 --> 00:09:41,905
What's on your mind?

211
00:09:41,907 --> 00:09:43,407
Just wondering if we need to rethink

212
00:09:43,409 --> 00:09:45,451
how we're going to catch him.

213
00:09:45,453 --> 00:09:48,120
Stop, that did not happen.

214
00:09:48,122 --> 00:09:49,913
Yes, it did.

215
00:09:49,915 --> 00:09:54,510
Look, my lips went numb,
and then they swelled up

216
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:57,612
so bad it looked like
I had plastic surgery.

217
00:09:57,615 --> 00:09:59,548
- What did Wally do?
- He laughed, of course.

218
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,317
The baby laughed.

219
00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:05,279
At least now I know I'm
allergic to Szechuan peppers.

220
00:10:05,281 --> 00:10:09,308
Dad, do you mind if I
work here today, actually?

221
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:11,485
Might give us some time to catch up.

222
00:10:11,487 --> 00:10:14,813
Well, you know I'm never
gonna turn that down, so...

223
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:18,835
Uh, but, Cecile tells me that you have

224
00:10:18,837 --> 00:10:21,612
a fancy new office?

225
00:10:21,614 --> 00:10:23,873
Yeah, yeah, it's just,
you know, the plumbing

226
00:10:23,875 --> 00:10:25,708
is really lousy and I can't have water

227
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,432
dripping on my laptop, right?

228
00:10:27,448 --> 00:10:30,329
Well, hey, uh, the guy that
expanded our guest bath...

229
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:32,581
He did a really great job
and he's really affordable.

230
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:35,459
- Let me give you his number.
- No, Dad, it's fine, really.

231
00:10:35,461 --> 00:10:37,619
Iris, if you don't take
care of this quickly,

232
00:10:37,622 --> 00:10:38,813
it could snowball.

233
00:10:38,815 --> 00:10:41,340
Here. Let me just send it to you.

234
00:10:41,342 --> 00:10:42,958
Okay, yeah. Yeah.

235
00:10:42,961 --> 00:10:45,728
Actually, yeah, you know
what? That's a great idea.

236
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,304
Why don't you send it to
me and I'll head over there

237
00:10:47,306 --> 00:10:49,640
and see what I can do.

238
00:10:49,642 --> 00:10:51,016
- Thanks, Dad.
- Okay.

239
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:52,643
Muah. Love you.

240
00:10:52,645 --> 00:10:55,488
Love you more.

241
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:58,332
So, if we wanna boost
the crown's powers,

242
00:10:58,334 --> 00:11:00,910
we gotta get it to
talk to the M.A.D. 2.0.

243
00:11:00,912 --> 00:11:03,028
What about a logarithmic code?

244
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:05,812
Exactly. You see, this is why we need

245
00:11:05,815 --> 00:11:08,492
more scientists on the team.

246
00:11:08,494 --> 00:11:10,160
Shay tells me that all the time.

247
00:11:10,162 --> 00:11:12,421
Well, the guy knows
what he's talking about.

248
00:11:12,423 --> 00:11:14,474
All right, so, why don't you use

249
00:11:14,476 --> 00:11:16,517
my workstation, and I'll get this going.

250
00:11:19,505 --> 00:11:21,931
- Fascinating, right?
- Yeah, it should be.

251
00:11:21,933 --> 00:11:23,599
It's the merging of technology

252
00:11:23,601 --> 00:11:25,186
and human consciousness.

253
00:11:25,189 --> 00:11:26,499
And shark, but no, no, no.

254
00:11:26,502 --> 00:11:29,888
I'm referring to your
relationship with Shay Lamden.

255
00:11:29,890 --> 00:11:32,200
What do you mean, "relationship"?

256
00:11:33,662 --> 00:11:37,871
The way your posture relaxes
when you're speaking of him

257
00:11:37,874 --> 00:11:39,540
and the way your voice modulates...

258
00:11:39,542 --> 00:11:42,901
- It suggests a familiarity...
- Hm.

259
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:45,546
Or something more.

260
00:11:45,548 --> 00:11:48,382
We're both marine biologists,
so we have a lot in common.

261
00:11:48,384 --> 00:11:52,220
I guess you could say
we've grown very close.

262
00:11:52,222 --> 00:11:53,798
But he's just my patient.

263
00:11:53,801 --> 00:11:55,455
Oh, of course.

264
00:11:55,457 --> 00:11:58,801
Look at that. We have liftoff.

265
00:11:58,803 --> 00:12:01,395
They are actually talking. You see?

266
00:12:01,397 --> 00:12:03,806
I knew these two crazy kids
were gonna make it work.

267
00:12:03,808 --> 00:12:05,716
They aren't just synching up.

268
00:12:05,718 --> 00:12:08,236
The M.A.D. 2.0 is
acting like an antennae,

269
00:12:08,238 --> 00:12:10,637
amplifying the crown's psychic signal

270
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,914
beyond anything I could have imagined.

271
00:12:12,917 --> 00:12:15,317
We heard geek screaming.
How are things going in here?

272
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:17,269
I just need to synch
the helmet to my earbuds,

273
00:12:17,271 --> 00:12:19,896
- and we're good to go.
- Left that in the cortex,

274
00:12:19,898 --> 00:12:22,833
in the main console, by
the monitor to the left.

275
00:12:22,835 --> 00:12:24,493
You know what?

276
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:26,903
Come with me. I'll show you.

277
00:12:26,905 --> 00:12:29,615
- Great work, Cisco.
- Oh, well, takes a village.

278
00:12:29,617 --> 00:12:31,000
But every village needs a genius

279
00:12:31,002 --> 00:12:33,052
and that's me, so thank you.

280
00:12:33,054 --> 00:12:35,296
Now we just have to find
King Shark and talk him down.

281
00:12:35,298 --> 00:12:37,673
Why don't we get the
cure injector to Caitlin

282
00:12:37,676 --> 00:12:39,250
and make sure it's ready to go.

283
00:12:39,253 --> 00:12:42,144
Well, remember, we
gotta talk to him first.

284
00:12:42,146 --> 00:12:44,346
Right.

285
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:46,607
<i>We got a hit on King
Shark. He's at the wharf.</i>

286
00:13:00,698 --> 00:13:02,481
Caitlin, are you sure he's here?

287
00:13:02,483 --> 00:13:05,326
Oh, he's there.

288
00:13:05,328 --> 00:13:07,795
He's heading straight right for you.

289
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,949
Nora, you're up.

290
00:13:12,951 --> 00:13:14,302
Done.

291
00:13:14,304 --> 00:13:16,286
Okay, systems are synched.

292
00:13:16,288 --> 00:13:18,955
Shay? It's me, Tanya.

293
00:13:18,957 --> 00:13:21,333
These people are only here to help you.

294
00:13:21,335 --> 00:13:22,977
<i>Please listen to them.</i>

295
00:13:22,979 --> 00:13:25,187
It's okay.

296
00:13:27,224 --> 00:13:28,816
I think it's working.

297
00:13:28,818 --> 00:13:31,802
I think you're right.

298
00:13:31,804 --> 00:13:34,730
Let's ask him...

299
00:13:34,732 --> 00:13:37,766
Shay, stop! Please.

300
00:13:37,768 --> 00:13:39,994
Please. I don't know
what's wrong with him.

301
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:46,834
<i>Barry?</i>

302
00:14:12,261 --> 00:14:15,270
<i>Guys, what's happening? Where's Shay?</i>

303
00:14:23,564 --> 00:14:25,522
Shay?

304
00:14:25,524 --> 00:14:28,567
What is it?

305
00:14:28,569 --> 00:14:29,785
What's going on?

306
00:14:29,787 --> 00:14:31,695
<i>Is Shay okay?</i>

307
00:14:31,697 --> 00:14:33,956
Yeah. He's human again.

308
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:49,188
Where am I? Who are you?

309
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:50,356
- Hey, hey, hey.
- No, enough!

310
00:14:50,358 --> 00:14:52,358
- Just get off me!
- It's okay.

311
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,003
They're friends.

312
00:14:57,532 --> 00:14:59,049
Tanya.

313
00:14:59,051 --> 00:15:00,967
Yeah, it's... it's me.

314
00:15:03,538 --> 00:15:06,956
I'm... me?

315
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:09,184
How?

316
00:15:09,186 --> 00:15:11,002
We call it the cure.

317
00:15:11,004 --> 00:15:14,264
It's a serum that suppresses
dark matter in meta-humans.

318
00:15:14,266 --> 00:15:15,857
You're the first person to take it.

319
00:15:15,859 --> 00:15:18,726
Well, except you didn't take it.

320
00:15:18,728 --> 00:15:22,063
We, um, we gave it to you.

321
00:15:22,065 --> 00:15:24,181
My... my head is still swirling around.

322
00:15:26,352 --> 00:15:28,561
Are you saying I'm human again?

323
00:15:28,563 --> 00:15:30,521
Forever?

324
00:15:30,523 --> 00:15:32,448
Almost.

325
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:35,618
We developed a cure to work on
the human part of a meta-human.

326
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:39,697
The animal part of your brain
fought back a little bit.

327
00:15:39,699 --> 00:15:42,694
There's still some dark
matter in your pituitary gland,

328
00:15:42,697 --> 00:15:45,077
but with this new data,
we should be able to

329
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:48,664
address the cure and the
next dose should be permanent.

330
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:51,000
Monsieur Lamden, I
should introduce myself.

331
00:15:51,002 --> 00:15:52,960
Sherloque Wells. You've
probably heard of me.

332
00:15:52,962 --> 00:15:55,972
I have a question. I've
been debating in my brain.

333
00:15:55,974 --> 00:16:00,092
What drives the King Shark?

334
00:16:00,102 --> 00:16:04,455
Is it the shark, or is it the man?

335
00:16:06,795 --> 00:16:08,893
If you're asking should
I be held accountable

336
00:16:08,895 --> 00:16:12,405
for my actions, my answer is simple.

337
00:16:12,407 --> 00:16:14,157
Yes, I should.

338
00:16:17,737 --> 00:16:20,279
I don't remember how many people I hurt,

339
00:16:20,281 --> 00:16:24,000
or who, but that's no excuse.

340
00:16:24,002 --> 00:16:25,501
What do you remember?

341
00:16:25,503 --> 00:16:28,671
Fragments. Glimpses.

342
00:16:28,673 --> 00:16:30,715
One day, I was a scientist.
The next, I was trapped

343
00:16:30,717 --> 00:16:32,967
in that body and
everything felt heightened,

344
00:16:32,969 --> 00:16:35,270
like my emotions were on steroids.

345
00:16:35,272 --> 00:16:39,349
And the rage... There was so much rage.

346
00:16:39,351 --> 00:16:41,133
That makes sense. A
shark's amygdala triggers

347
00:16:41,135 --> 00:16:43,387
a huge emotional response
when it feels attacked.

348
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:46,022
Perhaps that's why you escaped today.

349
00:16:46,024 --> 00:16:47,765
You were frightened.

350
00:16:47,767 --> 00:16:50,902
I don't know. Today felt different.

351
00:16:50,904 --> 00:16:54,285
I don't remember much before
I started using Tanya's crown,

352
00:16:54,288 --> 00:16:55,606
but since then,

353
00:16:55,608 --> 00:16:58,442
my mind and memory
have been much clearer.

354
00:16:58,444 --> 00:17:01,871
And I especially remember the
kindness that you showed me.

355
00:17:09,956 --> 00:17:11,381
What...

356
00:17:14,052 --> 00:17:17,294
What happened?

357
00:17:17,296 --> 00:17:19,463
The dark matter in his
system is replicating.

358
00:17:19,465 --> 00:17:22,466
Tanya, I'm sorry.

359
00:17:34,522 --> 00:17:37,189
Shay, I'm sorry, but until this is over,

360
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:39,817
we can't let you leave S.T.A.R. Labs.

361
00:17:43,733 --> 00:17:45,357
Call me as soon as the cure

362
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,800
is ready to inject him a second time.

363
00:17:46,802 --> 00:17:49,427
We have to know if this works.

364
00:17:52,206 --> 00:17:53,682
- Barry?
- Yeah?

365
00:17:53,684 --> 00:17:55,258
When you said you wanted me to call you

366
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,625
it was so that we could ask Shay

367
00:17:57,628 --> 00:17:59,093
if he wants to take the cure, right?

368
00:17:59,096 --> 00:18:00,004
- Caitlin...
- 'Cause you know,

369
00:18:00,006 --> 00:18:01,356
out in the field, you
didn't really give him

370
00:18:01,358 --> 00:18:02,514
much of a choice.

371
00:18:02,517 --> 00:18:03,958
But that was kinda hard to do

372
00:18:03,961 --> 00:18:05,885
when King Shark had you dead to rights.

373
00:18:05,887 --> 00:18:07,893
We had a way of communicating with him,

374
00:18:07,896 --> 00:18:09,294
and you barely gave that a shot.

375
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:10,438
And we could have tried again.

376
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,867
I saved you, man. What
did you want me to do?

377
00:18:12,869 --> 00:18:14,477
- Risk your life?
- That's not the point.

378
00:18:14,479 --> 00:18:15,954
It should be. We're a team.

379
00:18:15,956 --> 00:18:17,521
We're supposed to have
each other's backs.

380
00:18:17,523 --> 00:18:19,190
And we agreed, as a team,

381
00:18:19,192 --> 00:18:20,900
to wait for his permission,
but you didn't even do that.

382
00:18:20,902 --> 00:18:21,876
And look what happened.

383
00:18:21,878 --> 00:18:22,756
You're alive,

384
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:25,863
and Shay seems to like being human,

385
00:18:25,865 --> 00:18:29,366
so that's a win-win.

386
00:18:29,368 --> 00:18:31,535
Is that what you think a hero does?

387
00:18:31,537 --> 00:18:35,081
Forces other people to do
what you want them to do?

388
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:38,309
He was gonna eat you, Cisco.

389
00:18:38,311 --> 00:18:40,082
What was I supposed to do?

390
00:18:40,085 --> 00:18:44,599
We agreed that the cure would
never be used as a weapon.

391
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:46,568
Tell me something.

392
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:49,979
Did you change your mind in the moment,

393
00:18:49,981 --> 00:18:51,814
or was this always part of the plan?

394
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:05,828
<i>♪ If I could turn back time,
I would do it all again ♪</i>

395
00:19:08,866 --> 00:19:10,324
Dad?

396
00:19:10,326 --> 00:19:13,369
I went by your office

397
00:19:13,371 --> 00:19:16,080
to talk to you.

398
00:19:16,082 --> 00:19:17,623
Dad, look. I, um...

399
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,458
Don't. Don't try it.

400
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:24,606
I heard about this crazy time
loop you all got stuck in.

401
00:19:24,608 --> 00:19:27,466
Cisco and Nora told me

402
00:19:27,468 --> 00:19:29,110
what happened in every version,

403
00:19:29,112 --> 00:19:31,929
and although I don't
remember any of them,

404
00:19:31,931 --> 00:19:34,140
just knowing what did happen...

405
00:19:34,142 --> 00:19:36,406
You weren't scared?

406
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:38,185
I don't know.

407
00:19:38,187 --> 00:19:39,862
I mean, I broke into Cicada's home.

408
00:19:39,864 --> 00:19:42,865
Dad, I fought him.

409
00:19:42,867 --> 00:19:46,152
And as terrifying as that was, I mean,

410
00:19:46,154 --> 00:19:48,112
at least I could react to it, you know?

411
00:19:48,114 --> 00:19:50,706
But now... now that he knows
who I am, who my family is,

412
00:19:50,708 --> 00:19:53,450
I mean, he could show up at any moment.

413
00:19:53,452 --> 00:19:54,919
I just, I...

414
00:19:54,921 --> 00:19:57,121
- I feel...
- Powerless.

415
00:19:57,123 --> 00:20:00,207
Yeah, I just...

416
00:20:00,209 --> 00:20:03,886
I don't know, I can't go back there.

417
00:20:03,888 --> 00:20:06,645
Okay, get up.

418
00:20:06,648 --> 00:20:08,147
Dad, I just told you...

419
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,150
I don't want to go back there, you know?

420
00:20:10,153 --> 00:20:12,511
I'm not taking you there.

421
00:20:12,513 --> 00:20:13,846
Then where?

422
00:20:13,848 --> 00:20:15,973
Someplace where I can show you

423
00:20:15,975 --> 00:20:19,351
how powerful you really are.

424
00:20:19,353 --> 00:20:21,353
Pack it up. Come on.

425
00:20:28,362 --> 00:20:30,216
We gotta talk.

426
00:20:30,219 --> 00:20:31,552
Don't you know you shouldn't

427
00:20:31,555 --> 00:20:33,432
interrupt others while they're brooding?

428
00:20:33,435 --> 00:20:35,659
Trying to get my Oliver Queen on here.

429
00:20:35,661 --> 00:20:37,846
I ran some more tests on Shay.

430
00:20:37,848 --> 00:20:40,089
The reason he doesn't
remember anything that happened

431
00:20:40,091 --> 00:20:42,475
this morning is because he
experienced a severe brain wave

432
00:20:42,477 --> 00:20:44,210
disruption in his frontal lobe.

433
00:20:44,212 --> 00:20:46,396
That's the feedback that we all heard.

434
00:20:46,398 --> 00:20:49,265
So, that's why he snapped on us

435
00:20:49,267 --> 00:20:51,100
Like it was "Jaws: The Revenge"?

436
00:20:51,102 --> 00:20:53,010
A frontal lobe that
compromised would of course

437
00:20:53,012 --> 00:20:57,142
result in lack of control
over emotions and judgment.

438
00:20:57,145 --> 00:21:00,392
So you think maybe the
crown might have done this?

439
00:21:00,394 --> 00:21:03,007
No, that's the thing. The
crown is not the problem.

440
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,780
The way the neurotransmitters
work in this device

441
00:21:04,782 --> 00:21:05,856
never would have caused that.

442
00:21:05,858 --> 00:21:06,963
So what you're saying is

443
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:08,859
the telepathic crown was
working the whole time?

444
00:21:08,861 --> 00:21:10,663
Yes, so that begs the question,

445
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,873
what caused King Shark to go berserk?

446
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:17,201
Guys, hey. Um...

447
00:21:17,203 --> 00:21:21,247
I just wanted to apologize for earlier.

448
00:21:21,249 --> 00:21:24,083
I was definitely too harsh.

449
00:21:36,907 --> 00:21:39,098
No way.

450
00:21:44,322 --> 00:21:46,372
Caitlin.

451
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,737
Hello, Flash.

452
00:22:00,078 --> 00:22:02,346
Cisco's cerebral scan is clear.

453
00:22:02,349 --> 00:22:04,518
Mine is as well. We
are both back to normal.

454
00:22:04,521 --> 00:22:06,393
No more strings on us.

455
00:22:06,395 --> 00:22:08,370
Killer Frost says she's
sorry for that ice blast.

456
00:22:08,372 --> 00:22:09,946
That was Grodd, too.

457
00:22:09,948 --> 00:22:11,523
Now she's ready for some payback.

458
00:22:11,525 --> 00:22:12,744
Yeah, me too.

459
00:22:12,747 --> 00:22:14,733
Do we have a 20 on our Simian Svengali?

460
00:22:14,736 --> 00:22:16,403
Data and company are working on it,

461
00:22:16,405 --> 00:22:17,880
but Grodd's psychic abilities

462
00:22:17,882 --> 00:22:19,864
are helping him conceal his location,

463
00:22:19,866 --> 00:22:21,322
so he could be anywhere by now.

464
00:22:21,325 --> 00:22:24,077
I thought every square
inch of A.R.G.U.S.

465
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:26,605
was supposed to be power
dampened 24 hours a day.

466
00:22:26,608 --> 00:22:27,631
It is.

467
00:22:27,633 --> 00:22:30,721
Then how does an
800-pound gorilla escape?

468
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,394
Let me show you.

469
00:22:32,396 --> 00:22:35,380
I went through our security footage.

470
00:22:35,382 --> 00:22:38,258
This is from the night
of May 22nd, 2018.

471
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,309
- That's the night...
- Of the Enlightenment.

472
00:22:41,972 --> 00:22:43,763
DeVoe's dark matter
wave took down all tech

473
00:22:43,765 --> 00:22:44,907
in the surrounding areas.

474
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:47,225
Luckily, our generators kicked in.

475
00:22:47,227 --> 00:22:49,644
- But not for a second.
- One second.

476
00:22:49,646 --> 00:22:50,816
That's all Grodd needed

477
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:53,064
to psychically implant
instructions in a guard.

478
00:22:53,066 --> 00:22:54,658
Instructions to secretly shut down

479
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,395
the power dampeners in his cell,

480
00:22:56,398 --> 00:22:58,606
and find out any other
information he needed to know.

481
00:22:58,609 --> 00:23:00,770
So that's why King Shark flipped out?

482
00:23:00,773 --> 00:23:02,865
Because Grodd was trying
to mind control him?

483
00:23:02,868 --> 00:23:04,301
Likely as a distraction.

484
00:23:04,303 --> 00:23:07,454
Grodd's only ever controlled
human minds before.

485
00:23:07,456 --> 00:23:09,456
He must have had a hard
time controlling King Shark

486
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:11,082
because of the animal part of his brain.

487
00:23:11,084 --> 00:23:15,437
So King Shark was trying
to resist Grodd's iron will?

488
00:23:15,439 --> 00:23:16,812
Respect.

489
00:23:16,815 --> 00:23:18,798
If Grodd's had his powers for a year,

490
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,609
why wait until now to escape?

491
00:23:20,611 --> 00:23:22,927
It's probably no coincidence
that the first thing he did

492
00:23:22,929 --> 00:23:24,804
was steal the telepathic crown.

493
00:23:24,806 --> 00:23:25,972
Tanya did say she's been

494
00:23:25,974 --> 00:23:27,524
working on the crown for a while.

495
00:23:27,526 --> 00:23:29,902
Grodd probably knew this
was his perfect opportunity.

496
00:23:29,905 --> 00:23:31,978
And it was thanks to our tech.

497
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,105
All right, well, now
that Grodd has the crown,

498
00:23:34,107 --> 00:23:35,824
what's gonna happen when he uses it?

499
00:23:35,826 --> 00:23:39,319
It'll amplify his mental
abilities a thousand-fold.

500
00:23:39,321 --> 00:23:41,821
Instead of just being
able to mind control

501
00:23:41,823 --> 00:23:43,656
a few people at a time...

502
00:23:43,658 --> 00:23:46,451
He'll be able to control the whole city.

503
00:23:55,887 --> 00:23:59,647
Forgive me. I'm intruding.

504
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,391
Or am I?

505
00:24:01,393 --> 00:24:05,136
I see him out there and I see
you in here in the shadows.

506
00:24:05,138 --> 00:24:06,679
Why is that, I wonder?

507
00:24:06,682 --> 00:24:08,556
Can you blame me?

508
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:10,066
You saw his hand transform.

509
00:24:10,068 --> 00:24:13,403
Yes, right. "Shark Week!"

510
00:24:13,405 --> 00:24:15,813
Not something you see every day, but no,

511
00:24:15,815 --> 00:24:18,858
I thought your hesitation occurred

512
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,896
before that moment, not after.

513
00:24:20,899 --> 00:24:25,113
It was a slight hesitation,
but it was there nonetheless.

514
00:24:25,116 --> 00:24:27,667
Again, why do you think that is?

515
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:29,177
I don't know...

516
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:32,664
No? Well, perhaps I could
be so bold as to offer

517
00:24:32,666 --> 00:24:35,708
a suggestion that it is not the hand

518
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,811
of which you were
frightened, but rather,

519
00:24:37,813 --> 00:24:40,713
it was seeing the face

520
00:24:40,715 --> 00:24:43,108
of the man that you love.

521
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:46,195
I don't love Shay. We're friends.

522
00:24:46,197 --> 00:24:49,013
All right, well, let's take
a look at that too, shall we?

523
00:24:49,015 --> 00:24:51,457
So this is a friend from another Earth,

524
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:53,610
for whom you left a high-paying job

525
00:24:53,612 --> 00:24:55,895
and for whom you have
dedicated every waking moment

526
00:24:55,897 --> 00:24:58,523
of your life trying to help.
It doesn't quite add up.

527
00:24:58,525 --> 00:25:01,618
I can't love Shay.

528
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:05,214
He's my dead husband's
doppelganger from Earth-2.

529
00:25:05,216 --> 00:25:08,383
How crazy would I have to
be to fall in love with him?

530
00:25:08,385 --> 00:25:10,398
No crazier than marrying the same woman

531
00:25:10,401 --> 00:25:11,911
from five different Earths...

532
00:25:11,913 --> 00:25:13,871
I know.

533
00:25:13,873 --> 00:25:15,390
I'm very good at marrying people,

534
00:25:15,392 --> 00:25:17,893
but not so great at staying married.

535
00:25:17,895 --> 00:25:19,370
Along the way, though,

536
00:25:19,373 --> 00:25:22,305
on these countless Earths
and countless doppelgangers,

537
00:25:22,307 --> 00:25:24,424
I learned there is one thing

538
00:25:24,426 --> 00:25:27,552
that makes all of us unique.

539
00:25:27,554 --> 00:25:31,147
And if that

540
00:25:31,149 --> 00:25:34,743
is what you fell in
love with, well then,

541
00:25:34,745 --> 00:25:37,562
perhaps a face doesn't matter that much.

542
00:25:53,121 --> 00:25:56,122
You missed a beautiful sunset earlier.

543
00:25:56,124 --> 00:25:57,674
Too bad.

544
00:25:57,676 --> 00:26:00,302
- It's my favorite time of day.
- Mine, too.

545
00:26:00,304 --> 00:26:03,588
I almost forgot what one looked like.

546
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:07,091
Did you know sharks are colorblind?

547
00:26:07,093 --> 00:26:10,696
When I was King Shark, my
world was dull and gray.

548
00:26:13,642 --> 00:26:16,100
And then I met you,
and everything changed.

549
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:22,732
I thought you were avoiding me.

550
00:26:22,734 --> 00:26:24,651
I was,

551
00:26:24,653 --> 00:26:27,779
but not anymore.

552
00:26:27,781 --> 00:26:30,740
Tanya, are you disappointed
in me now that I'm...

553
00:26:30,742 --> 00:26:33,927
No, not at all.

554
00:26:37,215 --> 00:26:41,643
They say every sunset is unique.

555
00:26:41,645 --> 00:26:45,147
Do you think that's true?

556
00:26:45,149 --> 00:26:47,223
Yes, I do.

557
00:27:04,743 --> 00:27:06,409
Dad, this is not going to work.

558
00:27:06,411 --> 00:27:07,836
You haven't even tried it yet.

559
00:27:07,838 --> 00:27:09,504
Look, I get it.

560
00:27:09,506 --> 00:27:11,414
I'm supposed to take out
my frustrations on that bag

561
00:27:11,416 --> 00:27:14,492
and somehow get over it,
but it's not that easy.

562
00:27:14,494 --> 00:27:15,919
To confront what ails you?

563
00:27:15,921 --> 00:27:17,868
No, it's not. It's hard.

564
00:27:17,871 --> 00:27:19,831
I had to go all the way
across the world to do it.

565
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:22,125
Are you talking about Tibet?

566
00:27:22,127 --> 00:27:23,685
I thought you went there to see Wally.

567
00:27:23,687 --> 00:27:25,545
I did, but that's not
the only reason I went.

568
00:27:25,547 --> 00:27:27,797
I went there to heal.

569
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:29,358
Is that why you were gone for so long?

570
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,516
Wally convinced me to
come east with the baby.

571
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:35,105
He said it would help me repair my mind,

572
00:27:35,107 --> 00:27:37,515
my body, restore this old soul of mine.

573
00:27:37,517 --> 00:27:39,701
So with Cecile's blessing,

574
00:27:39,703 --> 00:27:42,353
that's what I did.

575
00:27:42,355 --> 00:27:43,705
And did it work?

576
00:27:43,707 --> 00:27:46,950
I bent, baby girl.

577
00:27:46,952 --> 00:27:49,360
But Cicada ain't going to break me.

578
00:27:49,362 --> 00:27:50,879
Ain't going to break you either.

579
00:27:50,881 --> 00:27:52,363
Come on.

580
00:27:55,062 --> 00:27:57,018
Come on, Iris. Show Cicada what you got.

581
00:28:01,249 --> 00:28:03,466
Break him, Iris.

582
00:28:08,506 --> 00:28:10,974
Break him!

583
00:28:16,097 --> 00:28:19,265
Yeah.

584
00:28:21,245 --> 00:28:23,060
What's happening?

585
00:28:23,062 --> 00:28:25,438
Our fuzzy friend is crawling
up the Broome Belfry.

586
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,064
What is it with him and that tower?

587
00:28:27,066 --> 00:28:29,108
'Cause it's at the exact
epicenter of the city...

588
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:31,038
Making it the perfect
place to broadcast from.

589
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:32,612
He's going to use the crown.

590
00:28:32,614 --> 00:28:35,174
And get inside everyone's
head in the city.

591
00:28:43,416 --> 00:28:46,501
<i>Hear your master, Humans.</i>

592
00:28:46,503 --> 00:28:51,088
<i>Soon, you will only know my will...</i>

593
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:55,654
<i>The will of Grodd!</i>

594
00:28:58,321 --> 00:29:00,893
How long before everyone's
under Grodd's mind control?

595
00:29:00,896 --> 00:29:02,640
A few minutes, maybe less.

596
00:29:02,643 --> 00:29:04,803
We need to dismantle that
crown and get it away from him.

597
00:29:04,805 --> 00:29:05,777
I can try talking to him.

598
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:06,860
He's always had a sweet spot for me.

599
00:29:06,862 --> 00:29:08,154
- Good.
<i>- The hell you will.</i>

600
00:29:08,157 --> 00:29:10,677
Nope, Killer Frost is gonna
be a hard sell on that one.

601
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,519
We're immune to his mind control, right,

602
00:29:12,522 --> 00:29:14,021
because we're speedsters?

603
00:29:14,023 --> 00:29:15,665
No.

604
00:29:15,667 --> 00:29:17,408
Okay, The Flash Museum just straight up

605
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:18,859
got a lot of stuff wrong.

606
00:29:18,861 --> 00:29:20,244
Wait, but do you have any extra

607
00:29:20,246 --> 00:29:21,838
anti-mind control
headsets lying around?

608
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,060
There's a few in the workshop,

609
00:29:23,063 --> 00:29:24,698
but it didn't work so well last time.

610
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,367
Yeah, but now there's two of us.

611
00:29:26,369 --> 00:29:28,035
I need you to run at
him as fast as you can

612
00:29:28,037 --> 00:29:29,703
- without reversing time.
- Okay.

613
00:29:29,705 --> 00:29:31,997
- That'll get his attention.
- What are you gonna do?

614
00:29:31,999 --> 00:29:33,666
An old trick.

615
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:06,799
Get the crown!

616
00:30:09,537 --> 00:30:10,920
Dad?

617
00:30:26,387 --> 00:30:27,537
<i>We can't move.</i>

618
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,901
The mental dampeners are working,

619
00:30:28,904 --> 00:30:30,645
<i>but Grodd's too strong.</i>

620
00:30:30,648 --> 00:30:32,650
I'm trying to hack into the
crown, but Grodd won't let me.

621
00:30:32,652 --> 00:30:34,226
He's gonna kill them.

622
00:30:34,228 --> 00:30:36,996
Not if you turn me back.

623
00:30:36,998 --> 00:30:38,897
I can stop Grodd.

624
00:30:38,899 --> 00:30:42,443
He can't read my mind... At
least, not when I'm a shark.

625
00:30:42,445 --> 00:30:43,871
Can you do that?

626
00:30:43,874 --> 00:30:46,238
I mean, if we accelerate the cell cycle,

627
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,757
do something that will prompt a return

628
00:30:47,759 --> 00:30:49,124
to the dark matter cellular form.

629
00:30:49,127 --> 00:30:52,076
Right, right, perhaps a
vibration or a jolt, right?

630
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:54,079
Yes, if it was strong enough,

631
00:30:54,081 --> 00:30:55,956
but there would be
permanent consequences.

632
00:30:55,958 --> 00:30:57,934
If we re-saturate your meta-genic cells,

633
00:30:57,936 --> 00:30:59,144
that will eliminate the possibility

634
00:30:59,146 --> 00:31:01,753
for you to transform them
back into human cells.

635
00:31:01,756 --> 00:31:04,649
He won't be able to use the cure.

636
00:31:04,651 --> 00:31:08,302
Shay, if you agree to this,

637
00:31:08,304 --> 00:31:10,137
you'll never be human again.

638
00:31:10,139 --> 00:31:13,309
Tanya, I can save Flash,
the people of this city, you,

639
00:31:13,312 --> 00:31:15,475
and make up for some of the
horrible things I've done.

640
00:31:15,478 --> 00:31:17,078
I have to do this.

641
00:31:18,981 --> 00:31:21,148
I'm afraid of losing you.

642
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:24,702
You won't.

643
00:31:24,704 --> 00:31:27,112
Well, is there anyone in this room

644
00:31:27,114 --> 00:31:29,051
that can provide a vibrational jolt?

645
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,300
I'm doing it.

646
00:32:04,711 --> 00:32:08,570
<i>My mind grows.</i>

647
00:32:08,572 --> 00:32:10,072
<i>Soon,</i>

648
00:32:10,074 --> 00:32:12,991
<i>Grodd will rule this city,</i>

649
00:32:12,993 --> 00:32:14,660
<i>this world.</i>

650
00:32:14,662 --> 00:32:16,495
<i>And you...</i>

651
00:32:16,497 --> 00:32:20,257
<i>Gone forever.</i>

652
00:32:26,215 --> 00:32:28,524
- King Shark?
- Huh?

653
00:32:30,386 --> 00:32:35,556
King Shark wants you gone!

654
00:34:10,503 --> 00:34:12,545
Oh, no.

655
00:34:14,824 --> 00:34:16,632
Guys, King Shark's not moving.

656
00:34:16,634 --> 00:34:18,301
When a shark is turned upside down,

657
00:34:18,303 --> 00:34:19,904
it enters tonic immobility.

658
00:34:19,907 --> 00:34:21,537
<i>He's in a state of paralysis.</i>

659
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:22,958
How do we wake him up?

660
00:34:22,961 --> 00:34:24,790
Don't sharks have electroreceptor organs

661
00:34:24,793 --> 00:34:26,309
called ampullae of Lorenzini?

662
00:34:26,311 --> 00:34:28,836
It's how they detect
electromagnetic fields, right?

663
00:34:28,838 --> 00:34:30,396
Yes, it's how they navigate.

664
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:32,723
And it will also attract
electricity, right?

665
00:34:32,725 --> 00:34:36,194
So if we can get enough
electricity to him, we can...

666
00:34:36,197 --> 00:34:38,512
- Electrify his ass back up.
- Electrify his ass right up.

667
00:34:38,514 --> 00:34:40,514
<i>- Barry!</i>
- Yeah, we heard.

668
00:34:40,516 --> 00:34:42,158
Time for another old trick.

669
00:35:09,512 --> 00:35:10,937
You okay?

670
00:35:36,789 --> 00:35:39,781
- Yes!
- Yes!

671
00:35:53,505 --> 00:35:56,089
Nothing to it.

672
00:35:56,091 --> 00:35:58,142
Long live the king.

673
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,437
I know Grodd almost
turned all of our brains

674
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,991
into scrambled eggs,
but that Kaiju battle

675
00:36:12,993 --> 00:36:14,993
was the stuff of dreams.

676
00:36:14,995 --> 00:36:16,611
Seriously, way better than anything

677
00:36:16,613 --> 00:36:18,088
I read in The Flash Museum.

678
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:20,073
Now that Grodd is safely locked up,

679
00:36:20,075 --> 00:36:22,784
what's stopping him
from getting out again?

680
00:36:22,786 --> 00:36:24,761
A medically-induced coma,

681
00:36:24,763 --> 00:36:26,430
one safely administered by Caitlin

682
00:36:26,432 --> 00:36:27,914
and the A.R.G.U.S. medical staff.

683
00:36:27,916 --> 00:36:30,133
Exposure to the crown
kickstarted Grodd's

684
00:36:30,135 --> 00:36:31,843
mental abilities into high gear.

685
00:36:31,845 --> 00:36:33,610
They're growing even now.

686
00:36:33,613 --> 00:36:37,131
Fortunately, I realized that if
Grodd's brain remains inactive,

687
00:36:37,133 --> 00:36:38,683
he can't access his mental powers.

688
00:36:38,685 --> 00:36:40,944
Add in newly-enhanced
AI power dampeners

689
00:36:40,946 --> 00:36:43,304
that upgrade to keep
up with Grodd's power.

690
00:36:43,306 --> 00:36:45,523
You're welcome, by the way...

691
00:36:45,525 --> 00:36:47,284
Anything it takes to keep the city safe.

692
00:36:47,286 --> 00:36:48,944
Speaking of keeping the city safe,

693
00:36:48,946 --> 00:36:51,121
we couldn't have done this without Shay.

694
00:36:51,123 --> 00:36:54,699
How'd you guys convince him
to turn back into King Shark?

695
00:36:54,701 --> 00:36:56,534
We didn't.

696
00:36:56,536 --> 00:36:58,286
He volunteered.

697
00:36:58,288 --> 00:37:00,455
And you can never turn
him back into a human?

698
00:37:00,457 --> 00:37:01,990
I don't think so.

699
00:37:01,992 --> 00:37:05,618
So he's gonna stay King Shark forever?

700
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:18,297
Well,

701
00:37:18,299 --> 00:37:20,299
the good guys won once again,

702
00:37:20,301 --> 00:37:23,487
and yet you do not seem like
you're really celebrating.

703
00:37:23,489 --> 00:37:25,179
Why that is?

704
00:37:25,181 --> 00:37:27,491
After all that's happened today,

705
00:37:27,493 --> 00:37:30,363
I just wonder how it will effect...

706
00:37:30,366 --> 00:37:32,311
Your relationship?

707
00:37:32,313 --> 00:37:34,856
Well, that's a big
question, I must admit.

708
00:37:34,858 --> 00:37:36,574
But you know what?

709
00:37:36,576 --> 00:37:40,078
You will figure it out,
both of you, together.

710
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,360
If so, we'll have you to thank.

711
00:37:42,363 --> 00:37:44,505
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- Me especially.

712
00:37:44,508 --> 00:37:46,082
No, no, no. I did nothing.

713
00:37:46,085 --> 00:37:47,660
No, you're right, I
did help quite a bit.

714
00:37:47,662 --> 00:37:49,179
The point here is simply this,

715
00:37:49,181 --> 00:37:53,374
and that is that whether
it's man or shark or...

716
00:37:53,376 --> 00:37:56,169
man-shark,

717
00:37:56,171 --> 00:38:01,057
the heart wants what the heart wants.

718
00:38:01,059 --> 00:38:04,194
And so, you must be open to that.

719
00:38:04,196 --> 00:38:07,197
Sounds like you've solved
life's greatest mystery.

720
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:10,075
Well, that's what I do.

721
00:38:11,394 --> 00:38:13,519
If so,

722
00:38:13,521 --> 00:38:18,250
I hope one day, you find
what you're looking for too...

723
00:38:18,252 --> 00:38:20,618
Maybe in another doppelganger.

724
00:38:23,073 --> 00:38:24,456
Of course.

725
00:38:27,535 --> 00:38:29,511
I'll leave you to it.

726
00:38:33,383 --> 00:38:37,701
Tanya, you look sad.

727
00:38:37,712 --> 00:38:40,897
Why?

728
00:38:40,899 --> 00:38:42,757
We found each other today,

729
00:38:42,759 --> 00:38:45,051
and now that connection is...

730
00:38:45,053 --> 00:38:48,321
Still here.

731
00:38:48,323 --> 00:38:51,432
Shay, what you did...

732
00:38:51,442 --> 00:38:56,212
I would do it again for you, my love.

733
00:39:24,568 --> 00:39:26,266
Time to bend.

734
00:39:41,368 --> 00:39:43,159
King Shark versus Gorilla Grodd?

735
00:39:43,162 --> 00:39:45,800
Are you kidding me? I missed that?

736
00:39:48,049 --> 00:39:51,149
_

737
00:39:54,806 --> 00:39:59,141
Are you sure you don't want
something a bit more grown up?

738
00:39:59,144 --> 00:40:01,294
Um, you take that back.

739
00:40:01,296 --> 00:40:04,338
This snack is a delicacy
no matter how old you are.

740
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,007
Guys, hey.

741
00:40:06,009 --> 00:40:08,059
I just... Swedish Fish?

742
00:40:08,061 --> 00:40:10,061
I love those.

743
00:40:10,063 --> 00:40:15,016
Um, look, I know today has been crazy,

744
00:40:15,018 --> 00:40:17,393
and I just wanted to
make sure that we're good,

745
00:40:17,395 --> 00:40:19,812
I know Grodd made you
blast me in the face

746
00:40:19,814 --> 00:40:22,499
but I also know I kinda deserved it...

747
00:40:22,501 --> 00:40:24,150
Same with being ice blasted.

748
00:40:24,152 --> 00:40:26,628
I shouldn't have used
the cure as a weapon

749
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,663
and forced it on King Shark.

750
00:40:28,665 --> 00:40:30,674
I promise it won't happen again.

751
00:40:34,871 --> 00:40:37,705
Apology accepted.

752
00:40:37,707 --> 00:40:39,924
Goober.

753
00:40:39,926 --> 00:40:43,336
And we know something
good did come out of today.

754
00:40:43,338 --> 00:40:45,213
We know the meta-human cure works.

755
00:40:45,215 --> 00:40:47,666
And now we can use it
to help all of the metas

756
00:40:47,669 --> 00:40:50,676
in Central City and beyond.

757
00:40:50,678 --> 00:40:53,655
Maybe we start with Cicada.

758
00:40:55,391 --> 00:40:57,034
I'm sorry, what?

759
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:59,685
I know, I just...

760
00:40:59,687 --> 00:41:01,112
People can surprise you.

761
00:41:01,114 --> 00:41:02,947
Today definitely reminded me that.

762
00:41:02,949 --> 00:41:05,900
And like you've been saying,
everybody deserves a choice

763
00:41:05,902 --> 00:41:08,736
to be whoever they want to be...

764
00:41:08,738 --> 00:41:11,781
That includes our enemies.

765
00:41:11,783 --> 00:41:14,759
I think we should offer
the cure to Cicada.

766
00:41:16,854 --> 00:41:22,346
