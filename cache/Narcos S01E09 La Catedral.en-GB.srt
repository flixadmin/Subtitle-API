1
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:55,765
Good morning, Sergeant.

2
00:00:55,974 --> 00:00:58,225
Good morning, Paisa.
What have you got for us?

3
00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:03,230
I’ve got plumbing valves,
a bunch of clean towels,

4
00:01:03,314 --> 00:01:05,399
and extra uniforms for the guards.

5
00:01:13,992 --> 00:01:16,035
Let him go. He’s been checked.

6
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:18,037
Continue. Continue, Paisa.

7
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:19,831
Thank you, Sergeant.

8
00:01:19,914 --> 00:01:21,707
—Good day.
—Good day.

9
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:25,169
—Good day, Paisa.
—Thank you! Good day, Sergeant.

10
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:03,666
You’re here, my friend!

11
00:02:03,749 --> 00:02:06,418
—How you doing, Velasco?
—Good, brother. How was the trip?

12
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:08,462
Fine, fine. What a long drive!

13
00:02:08,546 --> 00:02:10,255
—Really?
—It’s really hot.

14
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:11,674
Did you encounter any problems?

15
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:14,426
Nothing. Perfect. Complete success.

16
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:18,681
I brought everything, including
the special items requested by Pablo.

17
00:02:18,764 --> 00:02:20,474
—What’s going on, buddy?
—Blackie!

18
00:02:20,558 --> 00:02:24,186
—I thought you forgot about us.
—Let me show you.

19
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:30,609
Oh, my God. All right, boys!
Get a ladder over here!

20
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,910
—Welcome to La Catedral.
—Hello.

21
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:41,120
Come on down, ladies.

22
00:02:42,914 --> 00:02:45,041
We’ll take care of you.

23
00:03:16,155 --> 00:03:19,324
Come on! Hurry up!
What? Is it heavy?

24
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:23,662
—That looks delicious, Paisa.
—All right, lobsters.

25
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:42,074
Excuse me, boss.

26
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:44,368
I’ve got a report.

27
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,163
Moncada and Galeano
are reporting that we got 10,000 kilos

28
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:49,540
through Mexico and the Caribbean.

29
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,709
Did they pay the war tax?

30
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:55,087
Yes, boss, but ever since
you settled things with the government,

31
00:04:55,171 --> 00:04:57,464
a lot of other people
have been complaining.

32
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:04,763
My expenses in and out of the prison
must be covered by everyone.

33
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:06,015
Understood.

34
00:05:06,224 --> 00:05:09,977
Moncada and Galeano said the Cali cartel
are preparing for a ceasefire.

35
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,106
As am I.

36
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,695
We’re going to negotiate a truce.

37
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:23,657
But first,
we’re going to kill a few of his men.

38
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:30,289
I’m sorry, boss, but the Cali cartel
is going to take that as an act of war,

39
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,124
don’t you think?

40
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,634
The purpose of war …

41
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:45,596
is peace.

42
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,807
What’s the deal, brother?

43
00:07:12,016 --> 00:07:13,392
Look what you’ve done to my car.

44
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,353
—Where?
—Look at this traffic jam.

45
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,771
Look what you did to my car!

46
00:07:17,855 --> 00:07:19,690
—How am I gonna drive this?
—It’s nothing.

47
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,650
Look at the fucking traffic jam
this is causing.

48
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:22,567
Yeah, man!

49
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:28,907
And you don’t even speak Spanish?
Get out of here.

50
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:30,909
—Don’t mess with me, asshole.
—Easy, man.

51
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:35,664
Son of a bitch. Are you gonna hit me?
What the hell have you come here for, fag?

52
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:38,334
I deserve respect, you son of a bitch.
So that’s it, then.

53
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:41,128
What, are you gonna hit me?
You and who else?

54
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:47,051
OK, take it easy.
It’s all right. It’s OK, now.

55
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,056
—Calm down, asshole.
—OK?

56
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:54,683
—Relax, man. OK.
—OK?

57
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,685
OK, calm down.

58
00:07:57,644 --> 00:07:59,355
Have some tolerance.

59
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:58,640
—Do you hear that?
—What?

60
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:02,561
People. Children. Laughter.

61
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:06,064
Even the vendors are back out.

62
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:11,945
And all because we gave Escobar
the keys to his own prison.

63
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,282
You did the right thing.

64
00:10:15,366 --> 00:10:16,992
You think?

65
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:21,163
You should be happy.

66
00:10:22,206 --> 00:10:25,334
Finally, people can return
to their normal lives.

67
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:28,295
Finally … we are at peace.

68
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:55,447
We spoke with Pablo,
and he is willing to negotiate.

69
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:02,829
Ten of my men
have just been killed.

70
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:06,500
Is that how you guys
begin negotiations?

71
00:11:06,584 --> 00:11:08,043
Two things, Pacho.

72
00:11:08,252 --> 00:11:14,925
First … Mr Galeano and I
had nothing to do with those deaths.

73
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:19,346
And the second thing …
this is war, Pacho.

74
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:23,475
There are deaths everywhere,
and we have casualties as well.

75
00:11:27,771 --> 00:11:30,357
We are willing
to pay three million dollars

76
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:33,902
to settle the dispute
we had in Los Angeles.

77
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,740
Pablo won’t accept anything
under $12 million, Pacho.

78
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:43,912
Twelve million is nothing to you.

79
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,043
Do you want to know something?

80
00:11:50,252 --> 00:11:52,588
It’s over.

81
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,881
What’s over?

82
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:57,301
The Medellín cartel.

83
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,638
No, you’re wrong, Pacho.

84
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,848
We export twice the amount you do.

85
00:12:03,932 --> 00:12:07,686
You invited me here
to give me this line of bullshit?

86
00:12:08,646 --> 00:12:13,733
Pablo put a war tax on the two of you
for $250,000 a month.

87
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:15,735
That’s how he treats
his friends and associates?

88
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:20,949
Don’t forget that, thanks to
Mr Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria,

89
00:12:21,032 --> 00:12:25,329
extradition was abolished.
That serves you very well, doesn’t it?

90
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:27,956
He was the one
who got us into this mess.

91
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:32,877
Killing politicians and cops,
bombing street corners and airplanes.

92
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:36,089
He started this fucking war.

93
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,344
Are we going to negotiate or not?

94
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:00,298
We’re here, gentlemen!

95
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:07,556
—Gentlemen!
—What a bumpy ride, Paisa.

96
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:09,891
Where did you learn to drive?

97
00:14:10,726 --> 00:14:13,478
We closed the deal at ten million dollars.

98
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:16,898
This takes care of the problem
we had in LA and ends the war.

99
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,611
Sounds like a good proposition.

100
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:22,946
Do you know what this means, boss?

101
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:26,825
We can maintain our infrastructure
and the government won’t be the wiser.

102
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:32,205
That way, we can … double our exports
in less than a month, Pablo.

103
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,044
How did he behave …

104
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:41,089
when he offered you the money?

105
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,218
What do you mean,
“how did he behave”?

106
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:48,054
What was his attitude?

107
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,391
Well … he was respectful, Pablo.

108
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,310
Respectful in what way?

109
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:56,480
—He wants peace, just like us.
—Yes, but …

110
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:59,608
how did he react
when you told him our solution?

111
00:14:59,817 --> 00:15:01,359
In a positive manner.

112
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:03,779
He just offered you the money,
just like that?

113
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:10,034
Well … he started
at three million dollars. Right?

114
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:13,955
But we said no, and told him
you wouldn’t take less than 12.

115
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:18,251
So he offered ten,
and we felt that was a fair deal.

116
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,672
Offered you three million?

117
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:26,885
He was feeling us out.
He knew we wouldn’t accept that.

118
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:32,850
If he really respected me,
he would be grateful if I accepted 20.

119
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,479
That’s right, boss.
Ask for 20. In one shot.

120
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:46,196
Tell him I’m not happy
with less than 30.

121
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:49,240
The Cali cartel won’t accept that, Pablo.

122
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:53,662
Thirty million …
if Cali wants peace.

123
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:20,438
Very good.

124
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:31,783
I also need to raise the war tax.

125
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:37,956
From now on,
a million a month,

126
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:41,710
for both of you …
and all our other partners.

127
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:53,680
Good move beating him,
you son of a bitch.

128
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:23,038
We talked with Pablo
and reached an agreement.

129
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,542
We agreed to …

130
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:31,254
—one million dollars.
—What?

131
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:36,134
Right.

132
00:19:39,054 --> 00:19:41,222
What about the house in Cartagena?

133
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:43,100
That’s not happening, right?

134
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,518
Do you want your house in Cartagena?

135
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:49,272
—Of course.
—OK … you will have it.

136
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:50,857
Don’t you see
things are improving?

137
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:53,902
No, I see things
are getting more complicated.

138
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:58,573
Instead of getting better …
things are getting worse.

139
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,456
Pablo doesn’t want peace with Cali.

140
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,542
Now, what about this war tax
he’s charging you?

141
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:13,463
$250,000 was a lot of money.

142
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,674
And now a million? Ridiculous.

143
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:20,845
What do you think I should do?
Call Pablo and tell him I won’t pay it?

144
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:23,264
—Obviously not.
—Then I don’t understand.

145
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:28,436
—What do you want me to do?
—It’s not right, Kiko, and you know it.

146
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:35,443
Look, I … adore Pablo.
I adore him.

147
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:41,741
But the thing is, I don’t know
what’s going on with him these days.

148
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:51,001
I don’t know.
Maybe he’s depressed.

149
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:56,965
We’re here in a Jacuzzi …

150
00:20:58,049 --> 00:20:59,843
free.

151
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:06,099
Do you love me?

152
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:09,686
Stop fucking around.
You make me angry.

153
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:49,202
What happened?

154
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,662
Did it stop?

155
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:54,582
Good morning.

156
00:22:54,665 --> 00:22:56,334
—What’s up?
—Are you “The Paisa”?

157
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:59,337
—Yes.
—Nice to meet you. Javier Peña.

158
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:02,590
Do me a favour
and get out of the truck.

159
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:08,346
—What’s going on?
—Don’t be afraid.

160
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:12,850
Up against the truck.

161
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:20,524
Let’s go.

162
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:24,695
Do me another favour.

163
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:26,281
Open it up.

164
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:36,249
Go on.

165
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:00,940
Look, gringos …
you don’t have the right to do this.

166
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:03,360
Of course we have the right.

167
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:09,448
You just press the button in the truck
and we will do the rest, OK?

168
00:24:09,532 --> 00:24:14,495
If the boss finds out that I let you
put cameras in the truck, he’ll kill me.

169
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:26,841
Pablo’s your boss?

170
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:29,219
Yeah? Yeah.

171
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:42,523
I am your boss. Yes?

172
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:45,193
It’s OK, it’s OK!
I’ll do whatever you say.

173
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:46,610
Yeah?

174
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:55,536
Are you OK, friend?

175
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,113
Good day.

176
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:14,157
—This is a--
—Yes, it’s a roulette wheel.

177
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,327
He has a casino
right there at La Catedral.

178
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:22,248
—Where did you get these pictures?
—From the DEA.

179
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:24,167
Of course.

180
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,169
It’s not just these pictures.

181
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:29,005
They also have pictures of judges,
local government people,

182
00:26:29,088 --> 00:26:34,051
other narcos, prostitutes …
Even soccer players come to visit Pablo.

183
00:26:36,304 --> 00:26:39,807
—Who else has seen these?
—No one, as far as I know.

184
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,101
That’s why we have to act now.

185
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:48,274
Do you think the DEA is capable
of leaking the photos to the media?

186
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:53,112
The DEA is capable of anything.
That’s why we have to do something now.

187
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,619
At one time, Escobar …
used to own all of Colombia.

188
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:04,707
Now he’s just the owner
of his own prison.

189
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:11,047
If I had to choose
between prostitutes at La Catedral …

190
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:13,716
or bombings in the country …

191
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:22,808
I would be eternally grateful
to these women.

192
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:32,443
Happy birthday, Pablo!

193
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,739
—Watch your step.
—Careful with the little girl!

194
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:39,992
How are you? Welcome.

195
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:44,247
Hello, sweetheart.

196
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:10,940
They’re the ones I hired?
I don’t believe you.

197
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:12,525
They are really good, Blackie.

198
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:15,194
I like them.

199
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:19,532
Come on, Pablo, tell us …
what are you doing these days?

200
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:23,411
—How do you spend your time?
—Aside from missing his family?

201
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:26,163
Of course.

202
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:27,957
He’s writing a book.

203
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,834
—Mother.
—What?

204
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:34,422
Isn’t it true?
You are writing a book.

205
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:36,507
Please, Mom.

206
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,259
Well, then, you tell them.

207
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,976
—It’s a collection of magazine articles.
—Many articles.

208
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:51,188
—Clippings. It’s a book of cartoons.
—Oh, cartoons!

209
00:28:51,272 --> 00:28:53,941
From newspapers and magazines
all over the world.

210
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,611
And you know what?
People write him every day.

211
00:28:56,819 --> 00:28:59,071
—It’s because they love him.
—Of course, I can imagine.

212
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:02,325
You have to find ways
to keep your mind occupied around here.

213
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:07,037
Yes, my love. And you have Judy’s husband
and Galeano to help you with the business.

214
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:10,333
Yes, on that note,
Kiko is so grateful to you

215
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:12,793
for all the responsibilities
you have given him.

216
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:14,378
Thank you very much.

217
00:29:14,587 --> 00:29:16,130
—We were in Cartagena--
—Where?

218
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:18,591
—We were in Cartagena last week.
—Oh, yeah?

219
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,011
Oh, yes, we spent
some beautiful days there relaxing.

220
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:23,971
It must feel good
to be able to relax like that.

221
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,349
—How nice.
—Wonderful, Tata. You can’t imagine.

222
00:29:26,432 --> 00:29:29,059
But I’ll tell you,
Cartagena is really expensive.

223
00:29:29,143 --> 00:29:31,937
Oh, it’s unaffordable.

224
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:35,441
Besides, this whole “war with Cali” thing,

225
00:29:35,525 --> 00:29:38,611
it’s tough, you know,
with the tax we have to pay.

226
00:29:38,695 --> 00:29:42,948
We understand it’s not easy,
but there’s not much we can do.

227
00:29:43,032 --> 00:29:44,575
It’s OK.

228
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:54,126
Kiko complained about that?

229
00:29:56,879 --> 00:29:58,797
He mentioned it.

230
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:05,012
He didn’t complain, Pablo,
he didn’t complain.

231
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:09,266
Everyone here is absolutely aware
of the huge sacrifice that you’re making,

232
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:12,102
for God’s sake.
So I think it’s normal, right?

233
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:13,937
It’s normal that
we’d give you our support.

234
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:17,567
Well, I think it’s normal …
I really do.

235
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:25,866
Juan Pablito, go play with your dad
for a little while, OK?

236
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:28,786
Honey, you should
play with the kids a little bit.

237
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,710
Leave the gift here.

238
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,878
I’ll look after it.

239
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:21,899
Apologize!

240
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:23,567
Apologize!

241
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:25,194
Apologize!

242
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,947
—Were you watching?
—Yes.

243
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:30,616
You apologize!

244
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,618
I’m sorry, boss.

245
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,538
I didn’t mean it.

246
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:43,170
—Relax.
—Are you all right, boss?

247
00:32:43,253 --> 00:32:45,548
Relax. That’s how the game goes.

248
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:48,217
Go on, go on.
You guys continue.

249
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:52,930
Are you all right, sir?

250
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:56,392
Boss.

251
00:32:57,226 --> 00:33:00,479
Excuse me, boss,
but I need to speak to you.

252
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:01,980
Everything OK?

253
00:33:03,524 --> 00:33:06,819
—Boss, we have a problem.
—What problem?

254
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:09,822
You remember that Moncada and Galeano
had a large shipment

255
00:33:09,906 --> 00:33:13,534
—that was seized in Boyacá?
—Yes.

256
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:16,579
—250 kilos.
—Exactly.

257
00:33:16,662 --> 00:33:20,958
Can you imagine, a farmer found
three million dollars buried in a field?

258
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:22,459
Do you know where that was, boss?

259
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:25,504
In Rionegro.

260
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:21,894
There’s cash buried everywhere.

261
00:34:22,812 --> 00:34:26,941
The guerrillas, the paramilitary,
the narcos …

262
00:34:27,942 --> 00:34:30,611
—Everybody’s burying cash.
—Yes, I know.

263
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,739
But right on Moncada
and Galeano’s property?

264
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:37,952
Don’t you think that’s strange, boss?

265
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:40,830
I think it’s strange.

266
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:12,820
Look. All this cash …

267
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:17,074
was found … in a field.

268
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:19,660
That’s good luck, Pablo.

269
00:35:20,661 --> 00:35:25,082
Or it could be bad luck.
For you both.

270
00:35:30,046 --> 00:35:34,424
It was on your property,
in Rionegro.

271
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:38,054
But Pablo,
those lands are over 300 acres,

272
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:41,264
and most of us rent out to the farmers.

273
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:51,025
You told me that you had
a 250-kilo shipment seized.

274
00:35:51,108 --> 00:35:52,568
That’s true.

275
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:54,945
The shipment equaled that amount of cash.

276
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,406
Who told you to open your mouth?

277
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:59,491
Not true?

278
00:36:01,785 --> 00:36:05,039
Pablo, do you think
we’re stealing from you?

279
00:36:05,122 --> 00:36:07,958
That we made up that whole story
about the seizure?

280
00:36:08,042 --> 00:36:11,003
If you’d like,
check with the cops in Boyacá.

281
00:36:11,087 --> 00:36:15,465
Right, because cops in Boyacá
are so honest, right?

282
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:20,637
Keep in mind that
we bought that property from Gustavo.

283
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:26,769
I even remember Gustavo saying
that you had cash stashed in every corner.

284
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:34,735
Gustavo …
would never forget where he buried cash.

285
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:40,490
Who’s putting this shit
in your head, Pablo? These assholes?

286
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:45,495
These fuckers would sell their own mother.
We are partners and friends.

287
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:52,962
Maybe that cash was lost
because I raised the tax?

288
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:56,132
Bullshit.
I paid the tax and never complained.

289
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,633
That’s a lie.

290
00:37:00,469 --> 00:37:04,473
—Because you complained to your wife.
—I haven’t complained.

291
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:07,684
You have no idea
what I talk about with Judy.

292
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:10,479
I understand this
is difficult for you, Pablo--

293
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:12,148
What is difficult for me?

294
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:15,859
Well, managing all of this.
That’s why you hired us.

295
00:37:15,943 --> 00:37:18,904
So we can manage it
and look after it.

296
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:24,493
You trust us, right?

297
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:27,621
I understand this makes you anxious--

298
00:37:27,704 --> 00:37:30,624
—Do I look anxious?
—No, I didn’t mean that.

299
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:33,418
—You said with certainty that--
—No, no, what I meant to say was--

300
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:38,757
—I think you’re the one who’s anxious.
—We didn’t do shit, Pablo!

301
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:46,015
With that tone of yours …
you’re telling me you didn’t do shit?

302
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:52,104
Like I was some kind of idiot.
Is this my cash or not‽

303
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:53,230
No, Pablo.

304
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:57,234
Did you take it and bury it
in Rionegro or not‽

305
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:59,277
For sure,
these guys hid your cash, boss.

306
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:02,239
—It’s the truth, you pair of liars.
—Of course, he--

307
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:04,574
—Shut up, motherfucker!
—You’re petty thieves!

308
00:38:04,658 --> 00:38:08,537
You shut up, motherfucker!
Don’t you disrespect me!

309
00:38:13,042 --> 00:38:15,211
Pablo, look at me, man.

310
00:38:17,129 --> 00:38:19,339
We’re family.

311
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:24,220
You’re my daughter’s godfather.

312
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:27,597
And also godfather to Galeano’s kids.

313
00:38:29,183 --> 00:38:30,350
What’s going on?

314
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:38,316
We’re like brothers.

315
00:38:39,735 --> 00:38:42,905
We’re partners and friends.

316
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:46,075
We’ve been in this
our whole lives, Pablo.

317
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:49,745
We made our first trip to Miami together.

318
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:55,709
We made so much cash together that
we don’t even know what we spent it on.

319
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:58,795
What’s the problem?

320
00:38:59,629 --> 00:39:01,924
What’s happening?

321
00:39:04,885 --> 00:39:07,554
The two of us love you very much.

322
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:09,848
And we’re very grateful.

323
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,247
All right.

324
00:39:34,915 --> 00:39:37,667
Being stuck in here …

325
00:39:38,794 --> 00:39:40,837
can make someone paranoid.

326
00:40:02,109 --> 00:40:05,737
Well, man,
these things happen, right?

327
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:10,284
We’re here for whatever you need.
Trust us.

328
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:12,286
I’m going to make a trip to Miami.

329
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:15,372
I’ll bring you a few little things
to keep you entertained, OK?

330
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:52,450
Pablo, don’t do it! Pablo, no!

331
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:19,477
You’re a dog,
you son of a bitch!

332
00:41:24,941 --> 00:41:29,154
What does it feel like
to take a shit on your own empire?

333
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,908
You want us to tell you
that we stole the money?

334
00:41:37,287 --> 00:41:43,168
At the end of the day, you’ll believe
whatever you want, motherfucker.

335
00:41:54,971 --> 00:41:56,514
Goodbye, Kiko.

336
00:42:00,602 --> 00:42:03,439
Kill me if you’re such a man,
motherfucker.

337
00:42:04,398 --> 00:42:06,649
Kill me with your own fucking hands!

338
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:09,069
Who are you talking to, asshole?

339
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,741
Motherfucker!

340
00:42:35,137 --> 00:42:36,388
Wait a second!

341
00:42:36,596 --> 00:42:38,474
Be careful, man.

342
00:42:44,938 --> 00:42:47,565
Look what the dead guy gave me.

343
00:43:02,164 --> 00:43:04,374
What the fuck!
You’re going to burn all the meat!

344
00:43:04,458 --> 00:43:07,085
What is wrong with you? Can’t you see
I’m doing it to cover the smell?

345
00:43:07,169 --> 00:43:11,381
—Yeah, but let’s not burn it all.
—What are we gonna do with all this meat?

346
00:43:11,465 --> 00:43:14,343
—What are you going to do?
—What am I supposed to do?

347
00:43:14,426 --> 00:43:16,178
What?

348
00:43:29,065 --> 00:43:31,234
Boss, are you OK?

349
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:34,821
Do you need anything, boss?

350
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:39,784
We’re grilling some meat.
Do you want some?

351
00:43:41,036 --> 00:43:43,413
No. I’m not hungry.

352
00:44:10,899 --> 00:44:12,359
Navegante.

353
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:14,861
Boss.

354
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:19,241
—Do you want me to wax it?
—No, relax.

355
00:44:19,324 --> 00:44:22,077
This one’s my favourite.
I enjoy it.

356
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:25,622
This is a beautiful car.

357
00:44:26,498 --> 00:44:29,167
Anything new on Galeano and Moncada?

358
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,714
Looks like the rumours are true, boss.

359
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:41,096
It’s a shame.

360
00:44:43,765 --> 00:44:45,642
I warned them.

361
00:44:45,725 --> 00:44:48,728
As the twig is bent, so grows the tree.

362
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:58,614
Do you still have that DEA contact?

363
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:02,284
Javier Peña? Of course.

364
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:05,328
I want you to contact him
and confirm the rumours.

365
00:45:05,537 --> 00:45:09,082
They’re just as interested
in screwing Escobar as we are.

366
00:45:11,585 --> 00:45:17,882
I haven’t heard from him since yesterday.
I’ve called everyone. I’m so worried.

367
00:45:17,966 --> 00:45:21,303
Pablo told me
that they left La Catedral.

368
00:45:21,386 --> 00:45:23,388
Just relax, sweetie.

369
00:45:24,264 --> 00:45:25,974
Your husband is fine.

370
00:45:27,142 --> 00:45:29,394
No, thank you.

371
00:45:31,647 --> 00:45:36,485
Maybe … they had to go
somewhere else urgently?

372
00:45:36,693 --> 00:45:38,445
Or maybe they left
without saying anything.

373
00:45:38,654 --> 00:45:40,614
The way our men usually do.

374
00:45:40,697 --> 00:45:43,241
Yes, but it’s a little strange,
don’t you think?

375
00:45:43,325 --> 00:45:47,663
Kiko was very clear that he had
a meeting with Pablo at La Catedral.

376
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,331
He said he would be home later.

377
00:45:49,539 --> 00:45:54,002
We’re trying to have another baby.
I think I told you that.

378
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:58,798
No? We’re trying to have another baby,
and the time is right,

379
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:02,218
so we had a very important date to keep.

380
00:46:02,302 --> 00:46:06,431
Are you sure that Pablo
told you that Kiko left La Catedral?

381
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:12,646
Are you telling me
that my husband is a liar?

382
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,191
I want my husband back.

383
00:46:19,068 --> 00:46:23,323
If Pablo told Tata that they left …

384
00:46:23,532 --> 00:46:25,701
it’s because they left.

385
00:46:26,618 --> 00:46:31,831
Listen …
Pablo is your kids’ godfather.

386
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:34,292
He would never hurt them.

387
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:15,787
What do you think?

388
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:24,462
These photos are worth looking into.

389
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,298
And believe me, I’m going to.
