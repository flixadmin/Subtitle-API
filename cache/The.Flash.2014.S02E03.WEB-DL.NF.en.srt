Um, yeah. Up ahead.

Okay. I'm by the window. Why?

12
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,452
Okay, great. You're gonna need to jump.

Yes. I trust you.

So what exactly were you thinking?

26
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,330
I got a hot lead on a

27
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,124
these guys have been

happens to be in our basement.

00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,608

40
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:57,825
Your blood pressure is 147 over 82.
You could pass out again.

41
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:01,329
It's merely a few points above the
140 average for someone my age.

42
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,706
{\an8}Besides, I have some ideas
I would like to contribute

43
00:02:03,956 --> 00:02:05,500
{\an8}to this discussion, Dr. Snow.

44
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,295
{\an8}And I want to hear them.
This isn't just a wormhole.

45
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,712
{\an8}It's my way home.

47
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,550
{\an8}Jay, you really think that we can use

48
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,928
this as some kind of bridge
from your world to ours?

49
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,139
Zoom uses the breaches. Why can't we?

50
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:20,432
CISCO: Well, we don't know how.

51
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,309
Everything I put through
just bounces back.

52
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:25,603
{\an8}If Zoom's using these breaches
to transport people from Earth-2,

53
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,314
maybe it takes a speedster.

Maybe I'm not fast enough.

58
00:02:39,867 --> 00:02:42,162
I don't believe your speed
is the entirety of the issue, Barry.

59
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,831
It might be the breach's stability,
or lack thereof.

60
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,334
He's right.
We need to think of the breach as a door.

61
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,836
And on Earth-2 there's another door.

62
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,128
{\an8}In between we have a hallway.

63
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:55,508
{\an8}But the hallway's constantly shifting,
twisting, collapsing upon itself.

64
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,344
{\an8}And the doors keep moving with it.

65
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:00,137
{\an8}So we stabilize the door,
we stabilize the hallway.

66
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,014
-And then I can jump through it.
-JAY: Exactly.

67
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:03,850
It would serve as a kind of cannon.

68
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,685
A speed cannon.

00:03:05,893 --> 00:03:06,978

to walk away from my own daughter?

and knocked me out.

this isn't some kind of a trap?

{\an8}If Lenny wanted Flash dead,

151

00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,233
Yeah, but she makes a point.

hear her out. Right?

160
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:32,785
{\an8}See, when I rebuilt the cold gun,

161
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,328
I didn't have time
to place a tracker on it.

162
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:37,999
So I devised a method of locating it
by borrowing some military technology.

163
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,917
See, the gun works
the same as thermal imaging,

164
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,628
only instead of infrared heat signatures,

165
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:44,130
it's looking for
ultraviolet cold signatures.

166
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:45,757
Whoa, look at that.

167
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:49,636
The gun's UV thermal reading
was last picked up at 5th and Hoyt.

I got it being a daughter.

trying to teach us lessons.

But you live by a code.

That's why I can't leave this alone.

Look, Joe.

296
00:15:16,748 --> 00:15:20,169
I've known you for,
you know, most of my life,

297
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:24,465
and I know that you always have
a good reason for the decisions you make.

298
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,926
And obviously, you were worried

299
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:30,262
that Iris would go down
the wrong path if Francine raised her.

300
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:31,638
I mean, look at Snart.

301
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,934
He's a criminal because he had Lewis
for a father. That could have been me.

302
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,518
Oh, come on. Never.

303
00:15:36,768 --> 00:15:38,354
Yeah, because I had you.

304
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,772
And so did Iris.

305
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:45,694
You just gotta trust in that
and tell her the truth.

306
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,989
Yeah, how do I do that
without hurting her?

307

She's not a little girl anymore.

You should've seen her
in action the other day.

Putting her neck on the line for a story.

310
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,956
She can handle anything
that comes her way.

311
00:15:57,123 --> 00:15:58,374
I've just lied to her for so long,

312
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,377
I'm scared she's not
gonna understand or forgive me.

313
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:03,129
I could lose her.

314
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,881
No. She's gonna forgive you.

315
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,301
You just gotta give her a chance.

316
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,221
(SIGHS)

317
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,725
We make our move at 9:00.

318
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:20,521
That's when the cleaning crews go in,
and the daytime shift leaves.

319
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:24,483
Now we'll go up in the
service elevator to the 27th floor.

320
00:16:24,691 --> 00:16:28,695
They got a two-man team of armed guards
working the 27th to the 29th floor.

321
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,739
But if we time it perfectly
with their shift change,

322
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,199
we should be able to get in and out.

323
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,867
And if timing doesn't work out?

324
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:37,038
-Then those guards don't make it home.
-But if we start on the top floor,

325
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,206
-there's a service elevator that will...
-Son.

326
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:43,252
You and I both know that there's
casualties in this line of work.

327
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,090
Rutenberg, you're the tech guy.

328
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,551
Did you find a solution
for the vault hallway?

329
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,013
Not yet. That Draycon Systems
keypad's gonna be a problem.

330
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,264
(CHUCKLES)

331
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,017
Fine. How about you?

332
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:01,353
You gonna disappoint me too,
or is that freeze gun of yours

333
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,023
gonna look after the
power source for the laser grid?

334
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,441
It's a cold gun.

335
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,235
And yes. But I have a better way
to get past the lasers.

336
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:13,199
That gun is the only reason you're here,
so shut up before I make you...

337
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,577
-Ow. Ow, my... My head!
-(BUZZING)

338
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:17,869
Oh, my head!

339
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,747
Ow! Ahhh!

340
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,084
-It feels like it's gonna...
-(BEEPING AND EXPLODING)

341
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,719
Nobody talks to my son that way. Nobody.

342
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,604
PATTY: Don't worry, sir.
I waited for you this time.

343
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:46,732
Okay, I may have done a quick
preliminary assessment of my own.

344
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,817
Something is definitely weird.

345
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,280
-Oh.
-Decapitation.

346
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,615
-Yeah.
-Yikes.

347
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:56,117
We're still recovering parts of the head,

348
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,410
so the ID is taking
a little longer than normal.

349
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,955
(SHOUTS) Ugh! Sorry.
I thought I stepped on an ear.

350
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:04,166
I didn't. If I did, I'd be hearing things.

351
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,792
-Oh, hell no.
-(BOTH LAUGH)

352
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,588
It doesn't look like the head was sliced
off with any weapon I'm familiar with.

353
00:18:09,796 --> 00:18:11,298
And I'm familiar with most weapons.

354
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,591
Yeah, you're right.

355
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:17,096
Perforation around the neck is too jagged.
It's almost like the head was blown off.

356
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,141
Like a meta-human
who can explode heads, right?

357
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,850
Not necessarily.

358
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,937
(RAPID BEEPING)

359
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,023
Traces of thermite.

360
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:29,275
-Bomb residue?
-Uh-huh.

361
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,193
But then why wasn't the
rest of the body blown apart?

362
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,444
I don't know.

363
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:36,198
The victim is David Rutenberg,
security systems expert.

364
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:39,285
And guess who's on his list
of known associates.

365
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,786
Lewis Snart.

366
00:18:40,952 --> 00:18:43,955
Lewis Snart? Isn't he related
to Leonard Snart AKA Captain Cold?

367
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:45,457
Please don't call him that.

368
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,708
Okay.

369
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:47,959
-Uh, one second. Come here.
-Sure.

370
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,171
I think this guy is part of Snart's crew.

371
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,631
So, Snart put a bomb in him
to keep him in line?

372
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:56,218
No, Snart wouldn't do that.
But his father would.

373
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:59,555
Wait, so Lewis is killing people,
and Snart's still working with him?

374
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:00,847
What happened with the deal you had?

375
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:02,391
Maybe he doesn't have a choice.

376
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:05,519
So you think Lewis
put a bomb in his own son

377
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:06,978
to force him to pull off a heist?

378
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:08,314
Snart still wouldn't do it.

379
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,191
He'd dig the bomb
out of his own head if he had to.

380
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,901
So there must be something else
that Snart cares about.

381
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,531
The only thing Snart
cares about is his sister.

382
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:24,163
-CAITLIN: Hey.
-Hey.

383
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,498
-Thought you might be hungry.
-Ah!

384
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:30,043
Good to know whatever Earth you go to,
there's always a Big Belly Burger.

385
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:31,378
Thank you very much.

386
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,046
Looks like you're making progress.

387
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:36,425
Slowly.
I should be able to do this a lot faster.

388
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,385
You miss it. Your speed?

389
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,762
Yeah. Surprising how much.

390
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,849
So what will you do
when you get back to your Earth?

391
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,559
I don't know.

392
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,020
Guess I'll just have
to get used to being...

393
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,231
Normal?

394
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,358
(CHUCKLES)

395
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:53,775
Yeah.

396
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:59,114
Two years ago, I was just a scientist
slowly trying to save the world

397
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,867
by purifying heavy water
without residual radiation.

398
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,118
Important work.

399
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,745
Yeah. It was.

400
00:20:05,912 --> 00:20:07,373
But after the particle
accelerator exploded,

401
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,750
I didn't need to wait years
for my research to save a life.

402
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,212
I could save one before breakfast.
I could save 50 before going to sleep.

403
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,256
There's nothing like that rush.

404
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,925
You guys have been fighting
so many battles, one after another,

405
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:21,470
I'm not sure Barry's
had time to take it in.

406
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,307
To appreciate how great it can feel.

407
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:29,603
Being a superhero isn't always
about how fast you can run.

408
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:35,484
It's about helping however you can,
wherever you're needed most.

409
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:39,821
I think that Jay Garrick, physicist,
has just as much to contribute

410
00:20:40,071 --> 00:20:43,074
as Jay Garrick, superhero. Maybe more.

411
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:49,998
You know what would help me
build the speed cannon faster?

412
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,668
-Hmm?
-An extra set of hands.

413
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,170
Specifically ones
with a surgeon's precision.

414
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,088
Me?

415
00:20:57,756 --> 00:20:59,841
Sure, if you think I can really help.

416
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,761
Hey, Caitlin. We need you up here.
Like, right now.

417
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:04,763
Sorry.

418
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:11,437
(BEEPING)

419
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,440
Oh, boy.

420
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,107
What is it?

421
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:19,528
Lisa, there are traces
of thermite on your skin.

422
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:23,114
Thermite? Like an explosive?

423
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,866
Not like an explosive...

424
00:21:25,116 --> 00:21:26,201
It's a bomb.

425
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:32,458
When you were knocked out,
your dad must have injected you with it.

426
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:44,219
IRIS: Hey. Dad, what's up?

427
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,389
Your message was pretty cryptic,
even for you.

428
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:52,394
Hey, baby.

429
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,230
I need you to sit down.

430
00:21:57,148 --> 00:21:58,984
Dad, what's going on?

431
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,823
Okay.

432
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,077
When I was still a beat cop,

433
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:11,538
me and my partner were on patrol.

434
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,708
And dispatch came on the radio.

435
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,544
A little girl had called in.

436
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:23,091
She said her mom had taken
some pills and she wouldn't wake up.

437
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:26,428
And the little girl gave the address.

438
00:22:28,054 --> 00:22:29,347
The address was mine.

439
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,017
By the time I got here,

440
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:37,523
your mother was unresponsive,
passed out on that couch.

441
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:41,777
And in that kitchen, the stove was on.

442
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:45,864
There you were,
standing in front of an open flame.

443
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,449
If I hadn't gotten here when I did...

444
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,535
Wait, my mom...

445
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,578
Your mom was a drug addict.

446
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:55,707
This wasn't the first time
something like that had happened.

447
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:01,046
I got Francine into another rehab,

448
00:23:01,212 --> 00:23:03,549
and a couple days later,

449
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,176
she was gone.

450
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,720
I looked everywhere for her, but...

451
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,724
Wife of a cop. She knew how to disappear.

452
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:16,728
I couldn't stand the thought

453
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:20,524
of you growing up
thinking you were abandoned.

454
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,401
Going to sleep at night
thinking your mother left

455
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:26,738
because you weren't enough to
make her stay, that you weren't loved.

456
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,532
Because I loved you.

457
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:33,119
I loved you with everything I got.

458
00:23:34,245 --> 00:23:35,622
Then we took Barry in.

459
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:39,417
And I saw the trauma
he was going through, and I...

460
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,295
I was sure. I was sure

461
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:47,092
that I did the right thing.
Not giving you that burden.

462
00:23:47,383 --> 00:23:50,261
What do you mean Mom left? I...

463
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,765
I don't... I don't understand.
I don't understand.

464
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,433
What are you telling me?

465
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,143
Your mother's alive.

466
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,482
She's here in Central City.

467
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:03,984
She wants to see you.

468
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,657
All these years, I thought...

469
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,786
Dad, you told me that my...

470
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,079
I know.

471
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:21,251
I should've told you sooner,
but I couldn't figure out the right way.

472
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,796
And the mother you thought you remember,

473
00:24:26,464 --> 00:24:29,009
the perfect mother in the stories
I made up for you,

474
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:33,514
that is the mother you deserved.
And I knew Francine couldn't be like that.

475
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:35,306
She would only break your heart.

476

It's okay. I understand.

480

You were just trying to keep me safe.

481
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:10,801
The micro-bomb casing must be made
of some kind of a ferromagnetic material.

482
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,804
Once you hold it steady with the magnet,
I can surgically excise it.

483
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,013
Put the magnet down!

484
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:17,473
This is a really concentrated bomb.

485
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:21,019
It's gonna combust if it's exposed
to magnetic friction and an oxidant.

-Air.
-Uh...

488
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:29,570

if it comes in contact with air.

Don't worry, Lisa. We're gonna find
another way to get it out.

Scientific minds, can we confer, please?

491
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:37,077
What if The Flash speed-extracts it?

492
00:25:37,327 --> 00:25:38,536
No. It's too risky.

493
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:41,206
I'm gonna find a way to get it out,
I just need a little time.

494
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,584
Well, we need to keep track of Lewis

495

until you figure out
how to disarm the bomb.

496
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:48,546
I wish we knew what he was
gonna steal next. And when.

497
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,548
Maybe I can get them to tell me.

498
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,175
Their tech guy is dead.

499
00:25:52,383 --> 00:25:54,052
So I'm betting they're
gonna need a new one.

500

I'm saying I'm gonna
infiltrate Lewis' crew.

the Kahndaq Dynasty Diamond

from Central City Museum last year.

520
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:02,453
That was locked up behind an AmerTek

with a Draycon XL-1218 keypad.

I was visiting my dad.

631
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:00,496
Yeah, me too.

632
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:03,166
-And yet you killed him.
-He deserved it.

633
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,376
Is that funny to you?

634
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,337
No.

635
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:11,132
What's funny is I finally
figured out your secret.

636
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,176
And what secret would that be?

637
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,054
You'd do anything to protect your sister.

638
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:19,890
Well, I know your secret too.

639
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:22,393
Better hope I don't talk in my sleep.

640
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,644
You won't.

641
00:34:24,019 --> 00:34:27,732
Today just proved what I've always known.

642
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,069
There's good in you, Snart.

643
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:35,198
Yeah, you don't have to admit it to me.

644
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:37,450
But there's a part of you that knows

645
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:39,494
you don't have to
let your past define you.

646
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:44,124
A part of you that really wants
to be more than just a criminal.

647
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,253
So I should be a hero like you, Barry.

648
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,381
What exactly does that pay again?

649
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:55,926
It's just a matter of time.
Something you'll have a lot of in here.

650
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,221
Not as much as you think.

651
00:35:00,055 --> 00:35:01,557
Be seein' you.

652
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:15,155
You really think that leopard's
gonna change its spots?

653
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:17,072
I do. (SIGHS)

654
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:20,285
Maybe we should transfer him
to the meta-human wing anyway.

655
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:21,952
I already got Patty on the paperwork.

656
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:23,496
All right.

657
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:29,210
Hey, I wanted to thank you
for the advice you gave.

658
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:33,381
I told Iris.
She's going to sit down with Francine.

659
00:35:33,964 --> 00:35:36,551
It was hard, but it was for the best.

660
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,969
I'm glad. Anytime.

661
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:40,388
-You're a good son, Barry.
-(CHUCKLES)

662
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:41,722
-I know.
-(LAUGHS)

663
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:47,145
-Thank you.
-WOMAN: You're welcome.

664
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,442
-Fancy seeing you here.
-(LAUGHS)

665
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:54,569
Okay, we have to stop
running into each other like this.

666
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:56,987
I know. We should just
make a schedule or something.

667
00:35:57,197 --> 00:35:59,907
Okay, great. Well, then I'll just have,
you know, my people call your people.

668
00:36:00,115 --> 00:36:02,076
See, that's the problem.
Neither one of us have people.

669
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:04,287
So, how are we possibly gonna do this?

670
00:36:09,124 --> 00:36:10,418
There. My number.

671
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:11,669
Oh!

672
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:14,297
That... That's what you meant, right?
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

673
00:36:15,215 --> 00:36:16,549
(STAMMERS) Yes.

674
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:18,801
-No.
-Yeah, uh...

675
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,762
No, you didn't. Um...
You know what, though?

676
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,639
I've actually been meaning
to give you my number,

677
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,891
in case you had questions about a case.

678
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,686
You know, sometimes when you call
through dispatch, it gets all jammed up.

679
00:36:28,894 --> 00:36:30,020
And this is efficient.

680
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,982
And as law enforcement colleagues,
efficiency is important.

681
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,484
Yes, it is. No, that's...

682
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,736
Yeah.
That's exactly what I was thinking too.

683
00:36:37,152 --> 00:36:38,738
Okay, great. Awesome.

684
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,781
-Okay, I'll see you.
-Yeah.

685
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,032
-Oh.
-Oh!

686
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,659
Just kidding. Okay.

687
00:36:44,034 --> 00:36:45,620
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

688
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:51,125
So, taking off?

689
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,752
Thought I'd say goodbye.

690
00:36:53,168 --> 00:36:54,337
And thank you.

691
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,172
Yeah, well,
I wouldn't leave a bomb in anyone.

692
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:58,508
Not even you.

693
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:00,175
It's more than that.

694
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:03,095
You were there for me
when I was feeling weak.

695
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,348
I hate feeling weak.

696
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:09,059
It's hard for me to trust people,
but I trusted you.

697
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:14,899
You know, you might actually
be my first real friend.

698
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,444
Is any of that true?

699
00:37:34,084 --> 00:37:36,003
Until next time, Cisco.

700
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:39,382
-Later, Golden Glider.

Ta-da! The speed cannon.

00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:03,614
CISCO: (GASPS) Wow! Look at that.

704
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,909
Dudes, you actually built the thing.

705
00:38:07,117 --> 00:38:09,620
MARTIN: Mr. Garrick, I am...
I am quite impressed

706
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:12,540
by what you've accomplished
during my recent wellness hiatus.

707
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,249
-Have you tested it out yet?
-Not yet.

708
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:15,751
Want to do the honors?

709
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:18,963
No, no, no, no! Now that I...

710
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:22,800
Now that I am back to optimal health,
please, allow me.

711
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,259
(GRUNTS)

712
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,348
Excelsior!

713
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:29,849
How did you stabilize it?

714
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:32,059
-CFL quark matter.
-Ah!

715
00:38:32,267 --> 00:38:34,687
CISCO: Negative energy density
with positive surface pressure.

716
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:38,023
-It's genius!
-You created CFL Quark Matter?

717
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:40,485
It's something we perfected on my Earth.
I'll show you some time.

718
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:43,321
You mean,
sometime in the next few minutes?

719
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:46,616
Oh...

720
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,784
Yeah, I guess this is it, huh?

721
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:51,912
Time for me to go back home.

722
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:56,417
Right now? I mean, we still need
your help with the breachers.

723
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,669
My first priority is Zoom.

724
00:38:59,044 --> 00:39:01,672
I need to find out what he's up to.
How he stole my speed.

725
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,257
But you can do that here.

726
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:04,925
And, you know, if you go back

727
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:08,596
then we can't get in touch with you
when we need your help,

728
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:10,431
or with Zoom,

729
00:39:12,057 --> 00:39:13,434
or whatever else.

730
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:15,978
It would be nice to be able to
pick your brain every once in a while.

731
00:39:16,186 --> 00:39:17,229
Get some more speedster tips.

732
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:19,857
JAY: Hmm.

733
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:27,907
Okay.
Once we take care of Zoom, I'm going home.

734
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,368
-That's fair.
-Good. (LAUGHS)

735
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,704
'Cause I could use a shower
and a shave, and some sunlight.

00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:34,955
(ALL LAUGH)

737
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,583
I'll, uh, see you later.

738
00:39:39,334 --> 00:39:41,962
So, Professor Stein, how are you feeling?

739
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:46,426
Well, uh, it appears that
a little rest heals all maladies.

740
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:48,553
(STAMMERING) I couldn't feel...

742
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:52,890

Professor Stein, can you hear me?

746
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:07,905
-Professor Stein?
-What happened to him?

747
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,907
He... He went up like Firestorm,
but the flame, why was it blue?

748
00:40:10,115 --> 00:40:12,702
I don't know. This isn't good.
We need to stabilize him fast.
