00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,869
IF YOU TAKE HER SIDE,
I TAKE BACK THAT PIZZA.

467
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:48,956
HI. IS ZOE HOME?

468
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:51,291
YEAH. YEAH, SHE IS.

469
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,878
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU
WERE BACK IN TOWN.

470
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,504
JUST FOR A FEW DAYS.

471
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:57,631
YOUR FOLKS KNOW
YOU'RE HERE?

472
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,383
I'M NOT 7.

473
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:02,762
HEY, WILL. DAD,
I TOTALLY FORGOT.

474
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:04,513
I TEXTED WILL ABOUT
MY GEOGRAPHY HOMEWORK.

475
00:21:04,555 --> 00:21:06,265
HE SAID HE'D COME
OVER TO HELP.

476
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,892
IS IT OK IF WE WORK
IN THE LIVING ROOM?

477
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:10,186
I DIDN'T REALIZE
THAT YOU TWO WERE...

478
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:11,687
AHEM...YOU KNOW.

479
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:12,688
FRIENDS?

480
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,981
YEAH.

481
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,649
FELICITY SET UP
AN ENCRYPTION SCHEME

482
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,276
SO I COULD TEXT ZOE
WHILE I WAS AWAY.

483
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,778
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.
WHY DIDN'T I KNOW THAT?

484
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:19,695
HOW COME YOU DIDN'T
TELL ME?

485
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:21,072
IT'S JUST TEXTING, DAD.

486
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:23,616
YEAH. YEAH, YEAH,
YEAH, SURE, YEAH.

487
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,119
UM, YOU GUYS CAN HAVE
THE LIVING ROOM.

488
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,788
I'LL BE IN
THE NEXT ROOM...

489
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,373
CLEANING MY GUN.

490
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:36,754
DON'T WORRY ABOUT HIM.
HOW'S IT BEING BACK HOME?

491
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,672
SUCKS.

492
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,592
GUYS WITH CAMERAS
ARE FOLLOWING MY DAD
AND FELICITY EVERYWHERE.

493
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:44,344
AND THAT'S
WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU?

494
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,680
WE'VE ONLY GOT
ABOUT 3 MINUTES

495
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,933
BEFORE MY DAD FINDS
AN EXCUSE TO CHECK ON US.

496
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:50,309
WHAT'S WRONG?
YOU TELL SOME GIRL

497
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,269
YOU HAVE A CRUSH ON HER

498
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,979
AND SHE DIDN'T
LIKE YOU BACK?

499
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,354
SORT OF.

500
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,190
COOL. WHAT'S HER NAME?

501
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:58,025
IT'S NOT THAT.

502
00:21:58,067 --> 00:22:00,360
THEN WHAT IS IT?

503
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,613
I DON'T KNOW.

504
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,364
I THINK YOU DO KNOW.

505
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,159
YOU JUST DON'T WANT
TO TELL ME.

506
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,744
MAYBE IT'S NOT
THE WORST THING.

507
00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:11,164
MY DAD AND AUNT DINAH
FIGHT INSTEAD OF TALK.

508
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:13,666
PROMISE ME WE'LL
NEVER BE LIKE THAT.

509
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:16,043
YOU GOT IT.

510
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:18,045
MIND IF I HANG HERE
FOR A FEW HOURS?

511
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:20,131
I REALLY DO NOT
WANT TO GO BACK HOME.

512
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:22,591
OK. WE SHOULD PROBABLY
OPEN THAT GEOGRAPHY BOOK.

513
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:23,342
YEAH.

514
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,512
GET UP. GO.

515
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,681
CURTIS: WHAT'S THAT MEAN,
"HE'S COMING FOR YOU"?

516
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,016
WELL,
THIS CHIMERA...

517
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,600
I'M REALLY GLAD THAT
NAME'S CATCHING ON.

518
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:33,602
HEY, HE'S
HUNTING VIGILANTES.

519
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:37,564
SO HE'S LIKE
AN ANTI-VIGILANTE VIGILANTE.

520
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,275
JOHN: MORE LIKE A PREDATOR
OR A LION TRYING

521
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:40,901
TO TAKE DOWN THE BIGGEST
IN THE JUNGLE.

522
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:42,862
DINAH: THAT'S QUITE A LEAP.

523
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,697
TELL THAT TO RENE,
WHO WAS NEARLY CUT
IN HALF,

524
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,657
HAD IT NOT BEEN
FOR THE KEVLAR,
OR RORY OR HELENA,

525
00:22:46,699 --> 00:22:48,701
NEITHER
OF WHICH WE CAN GET
IN CONTACT WITH.

526
00:22:48,742 --> 00:22:51,204
OLIVER AND I
CAME ACROSS THIS
COLLECTION OF MASKS

527
00:22:51,245 --> 00:22:53,539
IN CHIMERA'S
UNDERGROUND LAIR.

528
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,708
HE HAD THEM ALL
ON DISPLAY,

529
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,501
ALMOST LIKE
TROPHIES.

530
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,295
ANY WORD?

531
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:01,881
OLIVER: BEST GUESS IS THAT
SHE HAS A CONCUSSION

532
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,465
AND A COUPLE OF
BROKEN RIBS.

533
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:07,011
THEY'RE HAVING DR. SCHWARTZ
EXAMINE HER DISCREETLY.

534
00:23:07,053 --> 00:23:09,013
DINAH: DID SHE GIVE YOU
ANY INTEL ON CHIMERA?

535
00:23:09,055 --> 00:23:11,389
IS THAT WHAT
WE'RE CALLING IT?

536
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:13,726
I CAN ONLY HOPE. I MEAN,
IT'D BE NICE. HEH! AHEM.

537
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,270
NO, SHE WAS
IN TOO MUCH PAIN TO SPEAK.

538
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:17,395
OLIVER: MEANWHILE.
JOHN: MEANWHILE...

539
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:19,023
YOU'RE NEXT ON
CHIMERA'S LIST.

540
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:20,816
SO I CAN'T THINK OF
A WORSE IDEA

541
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:22,818
THAN GOING OUT
AS GREEN ARROW DURING
POLLARD'S TOWN HALL.

542
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,653
EXCEPT MAYBE SHOWING UP
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

543
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:26,488
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TELL POLLARD THAT
YOU'RE NOT COMING.

544
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,908
I THINK THAT'S DINAH'S JOB.

545
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:31,118
GREAT.

546
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,329
SCHWARTZ: EXCUSE ME.
UH, WHERE IS SHE?

547
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:34,830
WHAT?

548
00:23:34,872 --> 00:23:36,790
YOUR GREEN-HOODED FRIEND.
SHE'S NOT IN HER ROOM.

549
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,458
OLIVER: OH, FOR GOD'S SAKES.

550
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,711
WELL, DID WE REALLY EXPECT
HER TO STICK AROUND?

551
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:43,839
NO.

552
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:00,856
IT'S JUST ME.

553
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:02,775
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

554
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,944
CAPTAIN DRAKE TOLD ME
YOU BAILED
AT THE HOSPITAL.

555
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,779
I JUST CAME TO
CHECK UP ON YOU.

556
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,281
LET ME HELP YOU
WITH THAT.

557
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:10,366
I CAN MANAGE ON MY OWN.

558
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:12,492
YOU ARE SO STUBBORN.

559
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:15,537
YOU SURE
YOU AND OLIVER
AREN'T RELATED?

560
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,917
[SIGHS]

561
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:22,836
ACTUALLY, WE ARE.

562
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,838
HE'S MY HALF-BROTHER.

563
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,840
HA HA! THAT'S FUNNY.

564
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,176
I'M NOT JOKING.

565
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:34,181
ROBERT QUEEN WAS MY FATHER.

566
00:24:36,767 --> 00:24:39,812
SO WHEN YOU TOLD ME
ABOUT YOUR MOTHER,

567
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:42,982
YOU KIND OF
LEFT OUT A PRETTY
IMPORTANT DETAIL.

568
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:46,902
ROBERT WAS OUT OF
THE PICTURE LONG BEFORE.

569
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:49,113
I DIDN'T WANT TO
TELL YOU

570
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:52,199
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
TO RISK CHANGING THINGS.

571
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:54,952
CHANGING
WHAT THINGS?

572
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:59,206
YOU AND ME WORKING TOGETHER.

573
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:01,459
WHY WOULD IT?

574
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:04,211
OLIVER'S GOT HIS THING,
AND WE'VE GOT OUR THING.

575
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:06,672
RIGHT?

576
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:11,593
YEAH, WE DO.

577
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:21,645
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU, MS. MAYOR...

578
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:22,980
FOR NOTHING.

579
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:24,357
[HANGS UP]

580
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:25,899
WE HAVE A NEW PROBLEM.

581
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,860
DON'T WE ALWAYS?

582
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:29,820
DINAH, BEFORE
WE GET TO THAT,

583
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:32,781
THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT I NEED TO SPEAK
WITH YOU ABOUT,

584
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:35,368
SOMETHING I'VE BEEN
KEEPING FROM YOU.

585
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:38,578
WELL, THAT IS PAR FOR
THE COURSE WITH YOU, OLIVER.

586
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,456
THAT'S A FAIR POINT.

587
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:42,249
IN THIS INSTANCE,

588
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,251
I JUST...I NEEDED
SOME TIME

589
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:46,253
TO PROCESS
THE INFORMATION

590
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:48,005
BEFORE I SHARED IT
WITH EVERYONE.

591
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,049
WHAT INFORMATION?

592
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,176
THE NEW GREEN ARROW
IS MY HALF-SISTER.

593
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:56,680
SHE'S THE PRODUCT
OF AN AFFAIR THAT
MY FATHER HAD.

594
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,807
WOW.

595
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:00,684
HA HA!
I WASN'T EXPECTING THAT.

596
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,395
I REALLY HOPE YOU
CAN APPRECIATE

597
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:03,896
WHY I NEEDED
SOME TIME WITH THIS.

598
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,563
SURE. YEAH.

599
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,191
I HAVE LOTS OF QUESTIONS.

600
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:08,859
I HAVE A LOT OF
QUESTIONS, TOO.

601
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:11,278
I HAVE BEEN TRYING
TO CONNECT WITH HER,

602
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,489
BUT SHE IS
NOT VERY TRUSTING

603
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:15,949
AT THE MOMENT.

604
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,202
SOUNDS LIKE
YOUR SISTER, ALL RIGHT.

605
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:20,578
OK, WHAT'S
OUR NEW PROBLEM?

606
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,915
RIGHT. POLLARD
IS INSISTING YOU GO TO
THE TOWN HALL TONIGHT.

607
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:25,042
WHAT? YOU EXPLAINED
TO HER...

608
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:26,544
YEAH, OF COURSE I DID.

609
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:28,170
BUT SHE ACTUALLY THINKS
THAT WE MADE UP CHIMERA

610
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:30,381
AS AN EXCUSE TO GET YOU
TO NOT FACE THE CITY.

611
00:26:30,423 --> 00:26:33,217
IF I HAD A PROBLEM
BEING SCRUTINIZED,
DINAH,

612
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:35,302
I WOULDN'T LET
A CAMERA CREW
FOLLOW ME AROUND.

613
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:37,096
I KNOW. I EXPLAINED
THAT TO HER.

614
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,306
BUT IF YOU ASK ME,
SHE SEES THIS TOWN HALL

615
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:40,849
AS A CHANCE TO
PUBLICLY CRUCIFY YOU,

616
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,435
AND SHE'S NOT
GONNA MISS THAT.

617
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:43,977
I'M NOT EXPOSING
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE

618
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,105
TO WHAT COULD
POTENTIALLY BECOME
A WAR ZONE.

619
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:48,065
POLLARD CANNOT
FORCE ME TO.

620
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,316
I WILL TELL HER.

621
