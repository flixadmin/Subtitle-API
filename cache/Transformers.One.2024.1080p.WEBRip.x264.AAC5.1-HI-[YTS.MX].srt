I'm so glad you're here.

I must've taken a wrong turn.

Oreon Pix!

Orion Pax.
Who cares?

50
00:04:11,897 --> 00:04:13,932

I'm gonna smash you!

Hold on.
Whoa, whoa, hold on.
No need for violence.

53
00:04:19,575 --> 00:04:23,205
How about this:
I run away, you chase me.
We play that game. Huh?

Come on.
You're bigger, faster.
It'll be fun.

Let's give him a head start.

Why not?
It's not like
he can transform.

Evening, everyone.
Pardon me.

[chuckling] Okay, fellas!
Thanks for the head start.

85
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,482
You want to give me
another one?

86
00:06:04,482 --> 00:06:06,880
You're dead!
I'll take that as a no.

87
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,717
[grunts] Hey!
Watch where you're going!

88
00:06:08,717 --> 00:06:10,554
Oh...
What did you say, no-cog?

89
00:06:10,554 --> 00:06:12,116
Sorry, sir,
I didn't mean you.

90
00:06:12,116 --> 00:06:13,986
I was referring
to the bot
who was behind you.

91
00:06:13,986 --> 00:06:15,493
What? Where'd he go?

92
00:06:15,493 --> 00:06:16,956
The filthy
red and blue bot?

93
00:06:16,956 --> 00:06:18,925
Has a big mouth,
squeaky joints,

94
00:06:18,925 --> 00:06:20,630
gives off a corroded
metallic stench?

95
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,324
Where is he?
He went that way.

96
00:06:22,324 --> 00:06:24,502
When I get
my hands on that bot...

97
00:06:33,436 --> 00:06:35,238
All right, all clear.

98
00:06:35,238 --> 00:06:37,878
Okay, D-16,
I may be a little rusty,

99
00:06:37,878 --> 00:06:39,550
but "corroded"?
That is too far.

100
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,684
Let me guess.
Chased out of
the archives?

101
00:06:41,684 --> 00:06:43,752
[laughs] Yeah.
I had to jump
out of a window this time.

102
00:06:43,752 --> 00:06:45,556
Almost died.
[laughs] It was wild.

103
00:06:45,556 --> 00:06:47,789
And digging through
ancient data
is worth dying for?

104
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:49,153
Yes, it is.

105
00:06:49,153 --> 00:06:50,627
I need a new best friend.

106
00:06:50,627 --> 00:06:52,530
If there are clues
in our recorded history

107
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,631
that can help locate
the Matrix of Leadership,

108
00:06:54,631 --> 00:06:56,028
they're in the archives.

109
00:06:56,028 --> 00:06:59,394
Sentinel Prime,
the Sentinel Prime,

110
00:06:59,394 --> 00:07:01,506
is up on the surface
right now,

111
00:07:01,506 --> 00:07:04,740
risking his life for us
in search of the Matrix.

112
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,842
That's exactly what I'm doing.
I'm trying to help him.

113
00:07:07,842 --> 00:07:09,404
Yeah, okay. [laughs]

114
00:07:09,404 --> 00:07:11,175
The sooner Energon
flows again,

115
00:07:11,175 --> 00:07:13,342
the sooner we won't
have to mine for it.

116
00:07:13,342 --> 00:07:15,685
Don't you want
to choose your own path,
do whatever you want?

117
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,347
We're miners.
We mine, that's all.

118
00:07:18,347 --> 00:07:22,857
No, there has got to be
something more I can do.
I can feel it.

119
00:07:22,857 --> 00:07:24,892
Oh, yeah? Like the time
you had a "feeling"

120
00:07:24,892 --> 00:07:26,663
you could transform
without a cog?

121
00:07:26,663 --> 00:07:28,456
You said you were never
gonna mention that again.

122
00:07:28,456 --> 00:07:30,898
Took me three days
to pry you open.

123
00:07:30,898 --> 00:07:32,031
Your feelings
get you in trouble.

124
00:07:32,031 --> 00:07:33,571
Yeah, yeah.

125
00:07:33,571 --> 00:07:35,804
Just trust
in Sentinel Prime.
I do trust in him.

126
00:07:37,577 --> 00:07:39,467
Hey, if we did have cogs--

127
00:07:39,467 --> 00:07:41,744
I'd transform
into a shovel
and beat you.

128
00:07:41,744 --> 00:07:43,680
I don't like how fast
you answered that.

129
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,584
But listen, if you did beat me,
I couldn't give you this awesome

130
00:07:46,584 --> 00:07:48,850
Megatronus Prime thing
I have here. It's cool.

131
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:51,820
I'll give it
to someone else.
What Megatronus Prime thing?

132
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,690
Ah, it's nothing.
Just a, you know,

133
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,990
mint-condition Megatronus Prime
decal, first edition.

134
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,596
[gasps] What?

135
00:07:58,596 --> 00:08:00,455
If you don't want it,
I can just throw it away.

136
00:08:00,455 --> 00:08:02,061
Throw it away? Don't--
That's not funny.
Let me see.

137
00:08:02,061 --> 00:08:04,459
Wait. Don't grab.
You're gonna crease it.

138
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,101
You know, Sentinel says
Megatronus was the--

139
00:08:09,101 --> 00:08:11,004
The strongest Prime
to ever live.

140
00:08:11,004 --> 00:08:12,500
I know, buddy.

141
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:16,680
Looks good on you.
Ah, it's really cool.

142
00:08:18,376 --> 00:08:20,552
Thanks.
Always got your back.

143
00:08:21,214 --> 00:08:22,950

How much Energon have you mined
under my leadership?

149
00:08:56,016 --> 00:08:57,347
[all] So much, Elita-1!

150
00:08:57,347 --> 00:08:59,349
And how perfect
is my mining record?

151
00:08:59,349 --> 00:09:00,856
[all] So perfect, Elita-1!

152

154
00:09:05,256 --> 00:09:06,829
Are you happy for me?

155
00:09:06,829 --> 00:09:08,226
[all] So happy, Elita-1!

156
00:09:09,328 --> 00:09:10,998
[Orion] Elita-- I mean Captain,

157
00:09:10,998 --> 00:09:13,704
you are looking especially shiny
this morning. New polish?

158
00:09:13,704 --> 00:09:15,706
Orion Pax,
I'm sorry that I somehow

159
00:09:15,706 --> 00:09:17,499
gave you the impression
that we're friends.

160
00:09:17,499 --> 00:09:18,973
Apology accepted.

161
00:09:18,973 --> 00:09:20,711
Light up that wall!
Let's go! Ten seconds!

162
00:09:20,711 --> 00:09:22,339
Happy to take
the lead today, Captain.

163
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:23,978
Feeling like I have
enough power in me

164
00:09:23,978 --> 00:09:25,881
to drill down
and touch Primus myself.

165
00:09:25,881 --> 00:09:27,542
You don't have
the touch or the power.

166
00:09:27,542 --> 00:09:29,753
Ready positions,
rust buckets! Let's go!

167
00:09:29,753 --> 00:09:31,689
She's in a good mood today.
Mm-hmm.

168
00:09:31,689 --> 00:09:33,416
You ready?
Always ready.

169
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:35,055
Let's punch in.

170

00:09:41,028 --> 00:09:42,260
[miner] Brace up!

174
00:09:43,703 --> 00:09:45,604
Lower channel is open.

Drill power on max!
[tools whirring]

177
00:09:52,369 --> 00:09:53,469
[miner 3] Low bridge!

178
00:09:59,048 --> 00:10:00,245
Drill it out!

179
00:10:02,447 --> 00:10:03,611
I tapped a vein!

180
00:10:03,611 --> 00:10:05,921
[sputtering, metallic thud]

181
00:10:05,921 --> 00:10:08,187
[metallic groaning]

182
00:10:08,187 --> 00:10:10,453
It's unstable!
We got to go, we got to move!

186
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:19,495
Evacuate!

[all yelling]

188
00:10:21,398 --> 00:10:23,103
Everyone out!
Evacuate immediately!

189
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,775
The tunnel is closing.

190
00:10:24,775 --> 00:10:27,778
I repeat, the tunnel is closing!

191
00:10:27,778 --> 00:10:30,946
You with me, D?
[D-16] On your six! Keep going!

192
00:10:31,751 --> 00:10:32,915
Look out!

Jazz is stuck!

196
00:10:38,283 --> 00:10:39,449
Elita, we've got
a trapped miner.

197
00:10:39,449 --> 00:10:41,319
I'm falling back to assist.

198
00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:43,090
[Elita] <i>Negative.
Do not break protocol.
Evacuate!</i>

199
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,224
We're gonna need more lift.

200
00:10:45,224 --> 00:10:47,589
It's closing!
Just grab your pack and go.

201
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:48,832
Yeah. Good idea.

202
00:10:48,832 --> 00:10:51,164
What? No, I didn't mean it!

[electronic whirring]

204
00:10:54,433 --> 00:10:55,806
Pull him clear!

[Elita] <i>Pax, what's happening?</i>

207
00:11:01,603 --> 00:11:04,309
Nothing much. Just normal
protocol-following stuff.

208
00:11:04,309 --> 00:11:05,915
It's all good.
[deep rumbling]

209
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:09,248
Oh, that's not good.
[rumbling swells]

210
00:11:09,248 --> 00:11:11,822
Orion Pax, could you please exit
the tunnel of death?

211

Run! Run!

216
00:11:25,869 --> 00:11:27,695
Hurry!
We're not gonna make it!

217
00:11:27,695 --> 00:11:29,807
Come on! Go, go, go!

[electrical sputtering]

220
00:11:36,574 --> 00:11:38,673
What the hell, Pax?
I told you to evacuate.

221
00:11:38,673 --> 00:11:41,247
I did, eventually.
If I get fired because of you--

222
00:11:41,247 --> 00:11:43,216
Oh, please.
They're not
gonna fire you.

223
00:11:44,219 --> 00:11:45,647
Elita-1, you're fired.

224
00:11:45,647 --> 00:11:48,716
What? Why? I followed
protocol to the letter.

225
00:11:48,716 --> 00:11:50,652
That is true.
I was the one
who broke the rules.

226
00:11:50,652 --> 00:11:52,324
No one asked you!

227
00:11:52,324 --> 00:11:54,623
Darkwing, please,
I've worked too hard
for this.

228
00:11:54,623 --> 00:11:57,692
You are no-cog bots
with limited options.

229
00:11:57,692 --> 00:12:00,365
Report to waste management
immediately.

230
00:12:00,365 --> 00:12:02,037
Waste management?

231
00:12:02,037 --> 00:12:04,039
Elita...
Next time,
why don't you stop and think

232
00:12:04,039 --> 00:12:05,568
before you ruin someone's life?

233
00:12:05,568 --> 00:12:06,734
I'm sorry!

234
00:12:06,734 --> 00:12:08,406
[indistinct chatter]

235
00:12:08,406 --> 00:12:10,111
Hey, Darkwing!
Don't do it.

236
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:13,345
I may not have a cog,
but my finger can transform.

237
00:12:13,345 --> 00:12:16,282
Guess which one?
I'll give you
a "limited option."

238

[imitates mechanical creak]
[growls]

239
00:12:18,715 --> 00:12:19,923
Excuse me, sir.

240
00:12:19,923 --> 00:12:21,826
Allow me.
[grunts]

241
00:12:21,826 --> 00:12:24,257
I apologize
on his behalf for the--

242
00:12:24,257 --> 00:12:26,798
[slow groan] Why?

243
00:12:39,604 --> 00:12:42,671
[D-16] That really hurt. [sighs]

244
00:12:42,671 --> 00:12:44,211
What'd you expect?
He's metal.

245
00:12:44,211 --> 00:12:45,883
You know you were
out of line,

246
00:12:45,883 --> 00:12:48,116
talking back
to a superior like that.

247
00:12:48,116 --> 00:12:50,283
Darkwing was out of line.
He deserves it.

248
00:12:50,283 --> 00:12:52,087
[sighs]

249
00:12:52,087 --> 00:12:54,584
Aren't you tired of being
treated like we're nothing?

250
00:12:55,653 --> 00:12:59,028
He had every right
to hit me.
I interfered.

251
00:13:00,999 --> 00:13:03,758
Hey, and I appreciate
you having my back.

252
00:13:05,102 --> 00:13:06,871
I'm glad
you were there with me

253
00:13:06,871 --> 00:13:08,466
to get punched in the face.
That was fun.

254
00:13:08,466 --> 00:13:10,699
[laughs]
Anytime, buddy.

Maybe he found the Matrix.

Psst! Hey, D.

00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:55,441
Oh, good, you're up.
Come on, I have an idea.

291
00:14:55,441 --> 00:14:58,378
[D-16] Whatever this is,
it better be good.

292
00:14:58,378 --> 00:15:00,083
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay. Listen.

293
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,184
All right, what if...
what if...

294
00:15:02,184 --> 00:15:04,681
what if tomorrow

295
00:15:04,681 --> 00:15:08,520
we ran
in the Iacon 5000, huh?

296
00:15:09,556 --> 00:15:11,490
What if kill you
for waking me up?

297
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,228
No, no, no, hear me out.

298
00:15:13,228 --> 00:15:14,691
We don't even have to win!

299
00:15:14,691 --> 00:15:16,066
Oh, that's good,
because we wouldn't.

300
00:15:16,066 --> 00:15:19,267
But-- But if we beat
just one Transformer,

301
00:15:19,267 --> 00:15:21,269
it proves
we're just as good as they are.

302
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:23,403
Not only would we
go down in history,

303
00:15:23,403 --> 00:15:26,736
the mining bots
that did the impossible,

304
00:15:26,736 --> 00:15:28,606
but we would show everyone
that we're--

305
00:15:28,606 --> 00:15:30,674
we're capable
of so much more!

306
00:15:30,674 --> 00:15:32,016
Or we get
publicly humiliated

307
00:15:32,016 --> 00:15:33,743
and then busted
back to tier one.

308
00:15:33,743 --> 00:15:36,680
Yeah, but at least we would've
done something, you know?

309
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,319
Pax...
Come on, D.

310
00:15:38,319 --> 00:15:39,782
Pax.

311
00:15:39,782 --> 00:15:42,653
We're mining bots
who can't transform.

312
00:15:42,653 --> 00:15:45,887
We can't fly,
we can't roll,

313
00:15:45,887 --> 00:15:47,229
we can't race.

314
00:15:47,229 --> 00:15:48,296
Come on, let's go.

315
00:15:48,296 --> 00:15:49,792
[sighs]

316
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:51,299
All right, fine.

317
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:53,037
Yeah, maybe you're right.

318
00:15:57,802 --> 00:15:59,109
Maybe.

319
00:16:00,772 --> 00:16:03,674
[D-16] The Iacon 5000
is finally here!

320
00:16:03,674 --> 00:16:05,247
[Orion] I have a surprise
for you. Come on.

321
00:16:05,247 --> 00:16:07,447
Where are you going?
The stadium's that way.

322
00:16:07,447 --> 00:16:09,119
Yeah, yeah, I know.
Follow me.

323
00:16:09,119 --> 00:16:11,220
Great.
We're gonna be late now.

324
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,354
I wanted good seats.

325
00:16:13,354 --> 00:16:16,225
We came all this way to miss
the opening ceremony.
This is wonderful!

326
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,996
Trust me,
I know what I'm doing.

327
00:16:18,856 --> 00:16:20,064
Hold up!

328
00:16:20,064 --> 00:16:23,331
[electronic pulse]
[groans, sighs]

329
00:16:23,331 --> 00:16:26,763
Get caught in one of those,
it'll launch you
halfway across the city.

330
00:16:26,763 --> 00:16:28,369
Okay,
where are you taking me?

331
00:16:28,369 --> 00:16:30,239
[mechanical whirring]

332
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,769
Don't be a glitch, this will be
totally worth it. Trust me.

333
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:34,111
Hey, you don't be a glitch.

334
00:16:34,111 --> 00:16:35,805
Look, I know this is, like,
fun for you,

335
00:16:35,805 --> 00:16:37,378
like, we're joking around,

336
00:16:37,378 --> 00:16:39,974
but if you make me miss
any part of the Iacon 5000,

337
00:16:39,974 --> 00:16:43,549
I swear I will smelt
your face right off your...

Thunderglide and Behemoth!

341
00:16:58,597 --> 00:17:02,271
This is unbelievable!
I feel like I'm in the race!

342
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:07,034
You did this for me?

343
00:17:07,034 --> 00:17:08,145
No.

344
00:17:08,145 --> 00:17:10,147
I did this for us.

345
00:17:14,615 --> 00:17:17,682
[announcer] <i>And now the moment
you've all been waiting for.</i>

346

<i>Quintessons fear him,
but we love him!</i>

I love you, Sentinel!

00:17:35,031 --> 00:17:39,143
Yes! It feels so good
to be here with you all today.

[crowd quiets]

356
00:17:46,843 --> 00:17:49,043
It has been
precisely 50 cycles

357
00:17:49,043 --> 00:17:51,584
since the Quintessons
attacked our home.

358
00:17:51,584 --> 00:17:55,126
Fifty cycles since we lost
the Matrix of Leadership

359
00:17:55,126 --> 00:17:57,755
and our Energon supply
dried up.

360
00:17:57,755 --> 00:18:01,825
Fifty cycles since the battle
that killed the other Primes,

361
00:18:01,825 --> 00:18:03,794
my brothers
and sisters in arms.

362
00:18:03,794 --> 00:18:08,029
Today we honor the Primes
who gave their lives for ours

363
00:18:08,029 --> 00:18:11,736
and we show them
that the strength of Cybertron
will never be diminished.

364
00:18:15,973 --> 00:18:18,578
Racers, on your marks!

365

from the starting line.

The best seats
in the house!
[beeps, whirs]

[announcer] <i>Get set!</i>

370
00:18:31,591 --> 00:18:34,396
It's time to show them
we are more than meets the eye.

00:18:34,396 --> 00:18:35,793

I'm sorry, are those
miners in the race?

379
00:18:57,782 --> 00:19:00,224
Miners!
Those are miners,

[announcer] <i>This is insane!</i>

383
00:19:06,923 --> 00:19:09,563
There are miners
in the race!
Miners?

384
00:19:09,563 --> 00:19:10,795
No way!
They can't even transform!

385
00:19:10,795 --> 00:19:12,632
It's Orion Pax and D-16!

[electronic pulsing, zipping]

I'm gonna kill you!

I owe you one.
More like a thousand.

we're not in last place!

is we're halfway
into the first shift

more than just mine--

Outstanding! I love a bot
that can think for himself.

496

Perhaps you two
could tour the mines,

help them see their potential.

I've got a treat for you.

escort these heroes

service facilities.

The Sentinel Prime!

510
00:25:14,092 --> 00:25:16,193
You still mad at me?
I am less mad at you.

511
00:25:16,193 --> 00:25:18,833
I'm telling you, D--
I got a feeling
that everything's gonna change

512

and we're gonna go--
[heavy footsteps]

00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:22,837
[growling] Miners!

514
00:25:23,367 --> 00:25:25,906
Hi, Darkwing.

515
00:25:26,975 --> 00:25:29,470
[Orion] Oh, no, no, no.
[D-16] No! [yells]

516
00:25:31,375 --> 00:25:33,045
Wait, wait!
You don't understand!

517
00:25:33,045 --> 00:25:35,542
We were supposed to go
to Sentinel Prime's service pod!

518
00:25:35,542 --> 00:25:38,853
You two dolts aren't going
to see anyone ever again.

519
00:25:38,853 --> 00:25:40,349
I'll make sure of that.

520
00:25:40,349 --> 00:25:42,659
You're making a mistake!
Ask Sentinel!

521
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:44,793
[groans]
I hate that guy!

522
00:25:45,323 --> 00:25:46,861
[clattering]

523
00:25:50,834 --> 00:25:52,867
[clattering continues]

524
00:25:58,567 --> 00:26:00,336
You! How did you get down here?

525
00:26:00,336 --> 00:26:02,074
There's no access to this level.

526
00:26:02,074 --> 00:26:04,109
There is nobody
down here but me.

527
00:26:04,109 --> 00:26:06,650
[stammers indistinctly]
Oh, my gosh, you're real!

528
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:09,884
You're others!
You're not... me!

529
00:26:09,884 --> 00:26:12,623
You're here,
and you're not me!

530
00:26:12,623 --> 00:26:14,856
[laughs]

531
00:26:14,856 --> 00:26:16,858
Uh, yeah.
Awesome!

532
00:26:16,858 --> 00:26:19,355
I am so sorry. That must
have been weird for you.

533
00:26:19,355 --> 00:26:21,555
I just haven't had
a lot of company

534
00:26:21,555 --> 00:26:23,667
since they put me
down here in sublevel 50.

535
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:26,934
Fifty? But there
are only 40 sublevels.

536
00:26:26,934 --> 00:26:28,595
That's what I thought!

537
00:26:28,595 --> 00:26:31,565
Turns out there are ten more,
and they are not pleasant.

538
00:26:31,565 --> 00:26:33,336
Probably why nobody ever
really talks about them.

539
00:26:33,336 --> 00:26:34,744
How long have you
been down here?

540
00:26:34,744 --> 00:26:36,405
How long have I been here?
[laughs]

541
00:26:36,405 --> 00:26:39,606
Let's see, somewhere
between a long time and forever?

542
00:26:39,606 --> 00:26:43,346
I mean, I had other jobs,
but I kept getting reassigned

543
00:26:43,346 --> 00:26:45,216
'cause I'm so good
at what I do.

544
00:26:45,216 --> 00:26:48,252
Oh! I'm B-127, by the way.

545
00:26:48,252 --> 00:26:49,726
But you can call me B.

546
00:26:49,726 --> 00:26:51,387
And I'm actually
working on some nicknames.

547
00:26:51,387 --> 00:26:54,093
The one I'm floating right now
is Badassatron.

548
00:26:54,093 --> 00:26:57,866
Which is actually pronounced...
[deep voice] "Badassatron."

549
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,230
But if you have any critiques--

550
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:02,233
Yeah, great.
How do we get
out of here?

551
00:27:02,233 --> 00:27:04,169
Great question. You don't.

552
00:27:04,169 --> 00:27:05,775
We don't?
Nope.

553
00:27:05,775 --> 00:27:08,074
We have limited access
to the waste management area,

554
00:27:08,074 --> 00:27:12,144
but the new shift manager there
does not like distractions.

555
00:27:12,144 --> 00:27:15,180
No, they prefer we stay here
on the task at hand.

556
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,753
Which is?
Oh!

557
00:27:16,753 --> 00:27:19,690
The scrap comes in
from the chute there

558
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,483
onto the conveyor belt.

559
00:27:21,483 --> 00:27:24,420
Our job is to look for anything
that might be worth salvaging

560
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,126
before it hits the furnace
and gets smelted.

561
00:27:27,126 --> 00:27:29,161
So you watch garbage burn.

562
00:27:29,161 --> 00:27:30,657
Yes!

563
00:27:30,657 --> 00:27:32,296
It is so great
that you're here now.

564
00:27:32,296 --> 00:27:34,199
I can't wait to learn
everything about you.

565
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:36,036
And then tell you
everything about me!

566
00:27:36,036 --> 00:27:38,940
I have a lot of hopes and dreams
that I am just dying to share

567
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,271
with one or two
new best friends.

568
00:27:40,271 --> 00:27:42,471
Uh, yeah, I would love to--

569
00:27:42,471 --> 00:27:44,143
[splutters]
Where are my manners?

570
00:27:44,143 --> 00:27:45,947
Come on, I'll introduce you
to the rest of the crew.

571
00:27:45,947 --> 00:27:47,949
Hey, guys, we've got company!

572
00:27:49,183 --> 00:27:51,755
This is EP-508,

573
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:55,517
this is A-A-Tron,
and this fella here is Steve.

574
00:27:55,517 --> 00:27:57,926
"Steve"?
Yeah, he's foreign.

575
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,895
Question:
Do they talk back to you?

576
00:27:59,895 --> 00:28:02,194
Um, they're not real.

577
00:28:02,194 --> 00:28:04,834
[laughing]
Jeez, you think I'm that crazy?

578
00:28:04,834 --> 00:28:06,297
It's just
you've been down here a--

579
00:28:06,297 --> 00:28:07,870
No, I was talking to Steve.
[beeps and whirs]

580
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:09,333
[indistinct robotic speech]
[laughs]

581
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:10,499
Classic Steve.

582
00:28:10,499 --> 00:28:12,303
What is that?
Look at this guy.

583
00:28:12,303 --> 00:28:15,339
[mocks electronic speech]
It's coming from inside.

584
00:28:15,979 --> 00:28:17,847
Oh! Steve! No!

585
00:28:17,847 --> 00:28:21,048
I am so sorry.
[dramatically] Steve, no!

586
00:28:21,048 --> 00:28:23,149
We can fix it, don't worry.
My Steve!

587
00:28:25,989 --> 00:28:28,055
[voice over transmission]
<i>Quintesson ambush!</i>

588
00:28:28,055 --> 00:28:31,190
<i>Calling the High Guard
for immediate support.
Immediate support!</i>

589
00:28:31,863 --> 00:28:33,456
That's Alpha Trion.

590
00:28:33,456 --> 00:28:34,996
One of the Primes?

591
00:28:34,996 --> 00:28:37,328
<i>Repeat,
Zeta Prime has fallen!</i>

592
00:28:37,328 --> 00:28:40,166
It's an SOS message.
<i>Protect the Matrix!</i>

593
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:43,433
<i>Sending location coordinates.
Sending location coordinates.</i>

594
00:28:46,944 --> 00:28:49,340
Holy Primus!

595
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:52,640
Those are coordinates
to a location on the surface.

596
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,249
This could be
where the Primes died
in the Quintesson war.

597
00:28:57,249 --> 00:29:00,681
Which means
this is where we could find

598
00:29:00,681 --> 00:29:03,024
the Matrix of Leadership.

599
00:29:03,024 --> 00:29:06,555
What are you talking about?
It's an old beacon
inside a statue made of garbage.

600
00:29:06,555 --> 00:29:08,194
Or it's a clue
of how we could find

601
00:29:08,194 --> 00:29:10,966
the Matrix of Leadership.
No. No way. Absolutely not!

602
00:29:10,966 --> 00:29:13,760
Hey, D, come on,
this could be our chance
to show everyone we're not--

603
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,201
You already tried
to "show everyone"

604
00:29:15,201 --> 00:29:16,730
in the race
you tricked me
into running,

605
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,105
which got us
stuck down here

606
00:29:18,105 --> 00:29:20,536
in this waste hole
with this, uh...

607
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,473
really cool guy.

608
00:29:23,473 --> 00:29:25,706
Oh, thank you.
I'm just saying--

609
00:29:25,706 --> 00:29:27,510
There's a reason
no one goes
to the surface.

610
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:29,248
It's dangerous!

611
00:29:29,248 --> 00:29:31,613
I'm waiting right here
until Sentinel Prime
finds us.

612
00:29:31,613 --> 00:29:33,483
Oh, okay. Yeah. Hmm.

613
00:29:33,483 --> 00:29:36,552
Well, we'll just
stay here forever.
That cool with you, B?

614
00:29:36,552 --> 00:29:37,960
Forever? This is great!

615
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,193
I have new coworkers
and roommates.

616
00:29:40,193 --> 00:29:42,129
There's plenty of room
now that Steve is dead.

617
00:29:42,129 --> 00:29:44,263
I usually sleep
on the conveyor belt,
but you can totally have it.

618
00:29:44,263 --> 00:29:45,792
I'll sleep in the corner
next to A-A-Tron.

619
00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:47,530
Plenty of room
for you to stretch out, too,

620
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,939
'cause you're taller than I am.
Know what I mean?

621
00:29:49,939 --> 00:29:54,042
Hey, D, what do you think
Sentinel's reaction would be
if you personally handed him

622
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:57,012
the Matrix of Leadership
that you found?

623
00:29:57,012 --> 00:29:59,916
Okay, stop.
I know what you're
trying to do.

624
00:29:59,916 --> 00:30:02,182
And it's
definitely working.
I'm in.

625
00:30:02,182 --> 00:30:04,712
Hah, ha! Yeah, buddy.
How do we get
to the surface?

626
00:30:04,712 --> 00:30:06,890
Pfft! You kidding me?
The surface?

627
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:09,024
Easy. I know a way.

628
00:30:10,192 --> 00:30:11,785
But it won't be easy.

629
00:30:12,755 --> 00:30:14,755
[D-16]
Why is there so much trash? Ah!

630
00:30:14,755 --> 00:30:17,131
[Orion] Warn me
next time, please.
My mouth was open.

631
00:30:17,131 --> 00:30:19,628
[B-127] Only 49 sublevels to go!

632
00:30:20,697 --> 00:30:22,796
Waste-disposal trains
are the only vehicles

633
00:30:22,796 --> 00:30:24,974
that go all the way
to the surface.

634
00:30:24,974 --> 00:30:27,438
[D-16] Yeah, but they
don't allow passengers.
The trains are autonomous.

635
00:30:27,438 --> 00:30:29,836
Yeah, that's the
"won't be easy" part.

636
00:30:29,836 --> 00:30:32,311
It's perfect.
We'll be safe
inside the train.

637
00:30:39,782 --> 00:30:41,419
[worker] That's the last one.
Send 'er up!

638
00:30:41,419 --> 00:30:42,992
[door whirs, thuds]

639
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:49,163
[Elita] Hold up! One more.

640
00:30:53,235 --> 00:30:54,531
I'll lock it down.

641
00:30:55,974 --> 00:30:57,732
[electronic beeps, clicks]

642
00:31:02,607 --> 00:31:05,839
[laughs]
Thanks for being an idiot,
whoever you are.

643
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:08,985
Turning you in will
definitely get me promoted
back up a rank or two.

644
00:31:08,985 --> 00:31:11,020
Got her!
[grunting]

645
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,219
No, wait, I--

646
00:31:12,219 --> 00:31:13,550
Elita! Stop!

647
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,354
Orion?
Hold on, let me--

648
00:31:15,354 --> 00:31:16,586
Security! Sound the ala--

649
00:31:21,197 --> 00:31:22,889
[grunts angrily]

650
00:31:22,889 --> 00:31:24,902
She's headed to the engine!
Don't worry, I got this.

651
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:29,236
Hold on, let me explain!
We're on a mission!

652
00:31:29,236 --> 00:31:31,403
So am I. To ruin your life.

653
00:31:37,444 --> 00:31:39,950
[yells]
[all grunt]

654
00:31:41,943 --> 00:31:45,021
Elita, wait. We found a message.
We know where--

655
00:31:45,749 --> 00:31:47,881
This bot is crazy! Who is she?

656
00:31:47,881 --> 00:31:50,422
Dead end, Elita.
There's no way...

657
00:31:50,422 --> 00:31:51,621
Well, she's gone.

658
00:31:52,426 --> 00:31:54,459
[all grunting]

659
00:32:01,831 --> 00:32:03,072
[groans]

660
00:32:06,473 --> 00:32:07,901
Whoa!

661
00:32:07,901 --> 00:32:10,838
Why? Why am I doing this?
Why am I doing this?

662
00:32:10,838 --> 00:32:11,982
Climb faster!

663
00:32:20,124 --> 00:32:21,992
[all groaning]

664
00:32:26,955 --> 00:32:28,295
Gotcha!
[grunts]

665
00:33:01,561 --> 00:33:03,660
Ah, the surface.

666
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:06,201
It's beautiful.

667
00:33:08,073 --> 00:33:12,141
[B-127] I am speechless.

668
00:33:13,441 --> 00:33:15,639
Elita, listen to me.

669
00:33:15,639 --> 00:33:17,905
We know where
the Matrix of Leadership is.

670
00:33:17,905 --> 00:33:19,940
Oh, sure.
And I'm really a Prime.

671
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:23,350
I just prefer loading
crates of toxic waste.

672
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,847
Whoa.
Where did you get this?

673
00:33:25,847 --> 00:33:27,618
From my friend Steve.
Orion killed him.

674
00:33:27,618 --> 00:33:30,093
I did not kill Steve.
He was never alive.

675
00:33:30,093 --> 00:33:31,490
What?
Look.

676
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,690
Sentinel told us
he was going to the surface,

677
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,593
and then we found this message.

678
00:33:35,593 --> 00:33:37,826
We figured that we could
hand deliver it to him

679
00:33:37,826 --> 00:33:40,829
or scout
the locations ourselves.

680
00:33:40,829 --> 00:33:42,138

00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:04,116
<i>There was going to be
a secret gathering
of Quintesson commanders.</i>

856
00:45:04,116 --> 00:45:06,888
<i>Their elimination
could end the war.</i>

857
00:45:06,888 --> 00:45:13,059
It was a mission so important,
we Primes took it on ourselves.

858
00:45:13,059 --> 00:45:17,327
We agreed to meet Sentinel for
his sensitive intel in secret,

859
00:45:17,327 --> 00:45:19,967
here in this cave.

860
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,727
But we were not alone.

861
00:45:21,727 --> 00:45:24,037
[chittering]

862
00:45:24,037 --> 00:45:25,566
[Prime] Quintessons!
[Prime 2] They're here!

863
00:45:25,566 --> 00:45:27,073
[Prime 3] It's a trap!
Battle positions!

864
00:45:27,073 --> 00:45:29,537
Hold the line!
[Prime] Primus be with us!

865
00:45:29,537 --> 00:45:31,176
[laserfire pulsing]

866
00:45:32,377 --> 00:45:34,641
For Cybertron!

867
00:45:41,221 --> 00:45:43,353
[Alpha Trion]
<i>We were outnumbered,
but stood as one.</i>

868
00:45:45,621 --> 00:45:47,588
<i>Our victory was near.</i>

869
00:45:51,198 --> 00:45:53,066
<i>Until we were betrayed.</i>

870
00:45:59,910 --> 00:46:00,975
[metallic slice]

871
00:46:02,143 --> 00:46:03,142
[grunts]

872
00:46:04,277 --> 00:46:05,210
[pained yell]

873
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:07,608
[audio slows]

874
00:46:15,992 --> 00:46:17,893
[grunting]

875
00:46:17,893 --> 00:46:20,555
Sentinel, why?

876
00:46:20,555 --> 00:46:23,096
For all the power
of Cybertron.

877
00:46:26,332 --> 00:46:32,666
[Alpha Trion] <i>But Sentinel never
understood the true power
of what he desired.</i>

878
00:46:32,666 --> 00:46:36,736
<i>The Matrix of Leadership
can only be wielded</i>

879
00:46:36,736 --> 00:46:41,708
<i>by one that Primus himself
deems worthy.</i>

880
00:46:42,810 --> 00:46:47,417
<i>And Sentinel
most certainly was not.</i>

881
00:46:47,417 --> 00:46:49,485
No!

882
00:46:52,457 --> 00:46:58,791
Wait. Hold on. You're saying
that the Matrix of Leadership
just vanished?

883
00:46:58,791 --> 00:47:00,463
No.

884
00:47:00,463 --> 00:47:02,872
No, no, no. That is impossible.
I don't believe it.

885
00:47:02,872 --> 00:47:04,731
Why would Sentinel
do that?

886
00:47:04,731 --> 00:47:06,337
To make a bargain.

887
00:47:06,337 --> 00:47:08,273
A bargain? With who?

888
00:47:08,273 --> 00:47:11,012
[deep rumbling]

889
00:47:11,012 --> 00:47:14,510
With the new rulers
of Cybertron.

890
00:47:19,649 --> 00:47:21,484
[Orion] The Quintessons.

891
00:47:21,484 --> 00:47:22,716
[Elita] There are so many.

892
00:47:23,455 --> 00:47:25,554
[electronic whirring]

893
00:47:44,839 --> 00:47:46,047
He's here.

894
00:47:46,984 --> 00:47:49,281
Sentinel Prime is here.

895
00:48:06,069 --> 00:48:08,366
[warbling]

896
00:48:09,699 --> 00:48:11,732
[chittering]

897
00:48:22,382 --> 00:48:25,416
Keep your eyes open.
They always are.

898
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,336
[gasping]

899
00:48:45,966 --> 00:48:47,405
[guttural chittering]

900
00:49:06,459 --> 00:49:07,997
[Elita] I load those crates.

901
00:49:07,997 --> 00:49:10,428
Those are filled
with contaminated metal.

902
00:49:10,428 --> 00:49:12,133
I don't understand.

903
00:49:12,133 --> 00:49:14,762
What do the Quintessons
want with toxic waste?

904
00:49:19,307 --> 00:49:21,109
Our Energon.

905
00:49:28,052 --> 00:49:29,315
Traitor!
D, no.

906
00:49:38,194 --> 00:49:39,996
[grunts, groans]

907
00:49:41,956 --> 00:49:44,495
[straining]
I know what
I promised you

908
00:49:44,495 --> 00:49:47,630
but our mines,
they're running out!

909
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:49,830
There's barely
enough Energon for us.

910
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:52,404
[roars]

911
00:49:52,404 --> 00:49:54,637
I swear I will
get you the rest.

912
00:50:00,348 --> 00:50:02,183
Triple-time
every mining shift.

913
00:50:02,183 --> 00:50:04,878
No miner gets a break
until I get my Energon.

914
00:50:04,878 --> 00:50:06,550
All of it! Let's go.

915
00:50:15,924 --> 00:50:17,990
[ship rumbling]

916
00:50:22,799 --> 00:50:26,405
Now you have seen the truth.

917
00:50:29,872 --> 00:50:31,344
Every day...

918
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:37,944
Every single day
of my life

919
00:50:37,944 --> 00:50:40,518
has been a lie.

920
00:50:41,356 --> 00:50:43,015
My God, I knew it!

921
00:50:43,015 --> 00:50:45,886
Deep down,
I always felt
something was off.

922
00:50:45,886 --> 00:50:48,394
He deceived everyone.

923
00:50:48,394 --> 00:50:53,564
Sentinel bought himself power
and then put us to work
paying off his debt.

924
00:50:53,564 --> 00:50:55,335
I can't believe it.

925
00:50:55,335 --> 00:50:56,864
Well, obviously,
I can believe it,

926
00:50:56,864 --> 00:50:58,701
I just saw it,
but I still...

927
00:50:58,701 --> 00:51:00,736
I can't believe it.

928
00:51:00,736 --> 00:51:03,739
Sentinel lied

929
00:51:03,739 --> 00:51:05,873
to my face.
[Orion]
It was all a sham.

930
00:51:05,873 --> 00:51:08,711
How could we
have been so gullible?

931
00:51:08,711 --> 00:51:12,352
Oh, this-- this is going
to change everything.

932
00:51:12,352 --> 00:51:13,749
[thudding]

933
00:51:13,749 --> 00:51:15,256
[grunting]

934
00:51:17,051 --> 00:51:19,359
You just had to do it,
didn't you?

935
00:51:19,955 --> 00:51:21,691
Me? What did I do?

936
00:51:21,691 --> 00:51:23,528
You just had
to go to the surface,

937
00:51:23,528 --> 00:51:25,563
had to enter the Iacon 5000.

938
00:51:25,563 --> 00:51:28,137
You just had to break protocol!

939
00:51:28,137 --> 00:51:30,403
Who cares about protocol?
I do!

940
00:51:30,966 --> 00:51:32,570
I care!

941
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:35,210
Because nothing bad happens
when you stay on protocol!

942
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:36,706
Sentinel Prime
has been forcing us

943
00:51:36,706 --> 00:51:39,071
to work in the mines
until our gears strip,

944
00:51:39,071 --> 00:51:42,778
and all the while he's been
giving the Energon away
to our greatest enemies!

945
00:51:42,778 --> 00:51:45,781
And what do you think
he's going to do to us
when he finds out that we know?

946
00:51:45,781 --> 00:51:47,882
I'm not thinking about
what he's going to do,

947
00:51:47,882 --> 00:51:49,554
I'm thinking about
what we're going to do.

948
00:51:49,554 --> 00:51:51,325
That's the whole thing!

949
00:51:51,325 --> 00:51:53,723
You're never thinking about
anything else, just yourself!

950
00:51:53,723 --> 00:51:58,057
Fantastic!
Another Orion Pax master plan.
I can't wait to hear this.

951
00:51:58,057 --> 00:51:59,432
Don't you want
to stop him?

952
00:51:59,432 --> 00:52:01,335
No, I want to kill him!

953
00:52:02,602 --> 00:52:04,272
I want to put Sentinel in chains

954
00:52:04,272 --> 00:52:05,933
and march him
through the mines

955
00:52:05,933 --> 00:52:09,475
so everyone can see him
for the false Prime that he is!

956
00:52:09,475 --> 00:52:13,413
I want him to suffer
and then to die in darkness.

957
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:16,108
But we all know
that it doesn't matter

958
00:52:16,108 --> 00:52:17,747
what I want, right, Pax?

959
00:52:17,747 --> 00:52:21,355
The fact is,
we're just cogless bots. Right?

960
00:52:23,018 --> 00:52:28,197
[D-16 chuckles bitterly]
We had limited options,
and now... now we have none.

961
00:52:29,497 --> 00:52:34,467
No son or daughter of Cybertron
is born without a cog.

962
00:52:34,467 --> 00:52:37,404
Oh, yeah.
I've been with myself
since I came online,

963
00:52:37,404 --> 00:52:40,374
and this slot's
always been empty.

964
00:52:40,374 --> 00:52:42,409
What are you saying?
Are you saying--

965
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:46,006
No. No way.
Nobody could be that evil,
not even Sentinel.

966
00:52:46,006 --> 00:52:50,450
He removed your cogs
before you came online.

967
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:55,653
We were born with
transformation cogs,
but he...

968
00:52:55,653 --> 00:52:57,622
He took them from us.

969
00:52:57,622 --> 00:53:00,856
What defines a Transformer...
[grunts]

970
00:53:00,856 --> 00:53:03,331
...is not the cog
in his chest

971
00:53:03,331 --> 00:53:08,369
but the spark
that resides in their core.

972
00:53:08,369 --> 00:53:13,704
A spark that gives you the will
to make your world better.

973
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:18,203
My fellow Primes had that spark.

974
00:53:18,203 --> 00:53:22,251
And I see their strength
in you.

975
00:53:23,815 --> 00:53:30,325
Take their cogs
and access
your full potential.

976
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:32,459
Prima.

977
00:53:33,924 --> 00:53:34,989
Onyx.

978
00:53:35,596 --> 00:53:37,123
Alchemist.

979
00:53:37,895 --> 00:53:39,334
Micronus.

980
00:53:39,334 --> 00:53:45,164
Warriors of noble spirit,
loyalty, strength.

981
00:53:45,164 --> 00:53:49,168
Their uniqueness
enhanced by these.

982
00:53:51,909 --> 00:53:54,745
[electronic whirring]

983
00:54:03,283 --> 00:54:05,294
[electronic whirring continues]

984
00:54:16,032 --> 00:54:20,441
They were one. You are one.

985
00:54:20,441 --> 00:54:23,312
All are one!

986
00:54:36,492 --> 00:54:39,955
Wait. We have...
You-- You gave us...

987
00:54:39,955 --> 00:54:43,464
The ability
to change your world.

988
00:54:43,464 --> 00:54:48,634
How you choose
to use that power
is up to you.

989
00:54:50,264 --> 00:54:51,736
[laughs]

990
00:54:52,299 --> 00:54:53,573
[heavy thud]

991
00:54:53,573 --> 00:54:54,904
They've found us.

992
00:54:54,904 --> 00:54:57,610
Oh, yes!
Time to fight back!

993
00:54:57,610 --> 00:55:01,482
No. You must return to
Iacon City and alert everyone.

994
00:55:04,685 --> 00:55:07,983
Embedded in this
are the records
I have shown you.

995
00:55:07,983 --> 00:55:10,458
Use it to reveal the truth.

996
00:55:11,626 --> 00:55:12,823
We will.

997
00:55:12,823 --> 00:55:14,957
This tunnel leads
to the mountains.

998
00:55:14,957 --> 00:55:17,828
Cybertron's future
is in your hands.

999
00:55:17,828 --> 00:55:19,324
[thudding boom]
We're out of time.

1000
00:55:19,324 --> 00:55:20,963
We got to move!

1001
00:55:20,963 --> 00:55:23,735
Wait, we can't just
leave you here.

1002
00:55:23,735 --> 00:55:26,298
Your fight will come,
my friend.

1003
00:55:26,298 --> 00:55:29,675
Primus has a purpose
for us all.

1004
00:55:29,675 --> 00:55:31,611
But this fight...
[heavy booming thud]

1005
00:55:31,611 --> 00:55:33,514
This fight is mine.

1006
00:55:33,514 --> 00:55:36,011
Now go!
[thudding continues]

1007
00:55:47,024 --> 00:55:48,430
Stand down, old timer.

1008
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:51,433
Ah. Old, you say?

1009
00:55:51,433 --> 00:55:53,369
[rumbling]

1010
00:55:58,134 --> 00:55:59,408

[roars]

1015
00:56:21,256 --> 00:56:23,223
Not too old for you.

1016
00:56:25,766 --> 00:56:27,260
[roaring]

1017
00:56:29,066 --> 00:56:30,230
We need to hurry!

1018
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:31,935
I still think
we have better odds

1019
00:56:31,935 --> 00:56:33,706
fighting than outrunning them.

1020
00:56:33,706 --> 00:56:36,742
Wait! We have cogs.
We can transform now.

1021
00:56:36,742 --> 00:56:39,712
That's right.
Everyone ready?
I was born ready.

1022
00:56:39,712 --> 00:56:41,373
On three. One--

1023
00:56:41,373 --> 00:56:43,045
[all yelling]

1024
00:56:43,045 --> 00:56:47,247
[faint yelling, grunting]

1025
00:56:49,955 --> 00:56:50,855
Ah!

1026
00:56:52,287 --> 00:56:54,463
[laserfire pulsing]

1027
00:56:55,125 --> 00:56:56,663
[grunting]

1028
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:58,192
How do we use these things?

1029
00:56:58,192 --> 00:57:00,128
I don't know. Just try.

1030
00:57:00,128 --> 00:57:02,031
[straining]

1031
00:57:02,031 --> 00:57:04,704
It's working. Ha! It's working!

1032
00:57:05,465 --> 00:57:06,541
My head! My head!

1033
00:57:06,541 --> 00:57:07,608
Whoa!

1034
00:57:07,608 --> 00:57:09,445
Help! Help!

1035
00:57:14,111 --> 00:57:16,650
This is not faster!

1036
00:57:18,049 --> 00:57:19,785
[yells, grunts]

1037
00:57:19,785 --> 00:57:21,556
Oh, come on!

1038
00:57:21,556 --> 00:57:24,658
And transform!

1039
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,957
[yelling]

1040
00:57:26,957 --> 00:57:28,695
Wheels! I need wheels!

1041
00:57:29,632 --> 00:57:32,160
[laserfire pulsing]

1042
00:57:34,362 --> 00:57:35,702
[Elita yelling]

1043
00:57:38,498 --> 00:57:39,398
Whoa.

1044
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:47,109
[audio slows]

1045
00:57:47,109 --> 00:57:49,683
[mechanical whirring]

1046
00:57:52,787 --> 00:57:54,314
[B-127 yelling]

1047
00:58:00,124 --> 00:58:02,663
[mechanical whirring]
Ha! [grunts]

1048
00:58:03,963 --> 00:58:05,600
[grunts, laughs]

1049
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,129
Oh, wow.

1050
00:58:07,129 --> 00:58:08,669
We're alive!
I've never moved that fast.

1051
00:58:08,669 --> 00:58:11,463
That was incredible!
Did you see me slide all over?

1052
00:58:11,463 --> 00:58:13,267
[overlapping chatter]

1053
00:58:13,267 --> 00:58:14,576
[laser blast]

1054
00:58:15,238 --> 00:58:17,502
[engine humming]

1055
00:58:17,502 --> 00:58:18,679
[mechanical whirring]

1056
00:58:18,679 --> 00:58:19,911
Yes!

1057
00:58:19,911 --> 00:58:22,947
[laughing deliriously]

1058
00:58:22,947 --> 00:58:24,509
Hey, whoa, buddy.
You okay?

1059
00:58:24,509 --> 00:58:28,183
I'm great. Are you kidding me?
We can transform!

1060
00:58:28,183 --> 00:58:30,350
We transform!

1061
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:31,989
Oh, hey! I know.

1062
00:58:31,989 --> 00:58:34,090
We're wasting time.
We have to get back to Iacon.

1063
00:58:34,090 --> 00:58:35,289
Looks like the fastest way

1064
00:58:35,289 --> 00:58:37,027
back to Iacon is--
Here, I got it.

1065
00:58:37,027 --> 00:58:38,523
Hey, what are you doing?

1066
00:58:38,523 --> 00:58:40,228
Don't worry, I got it.
Yeah, but be careful.

1067
00:58:40,228 --> 00:58:43,066
Our proof is inside and
you're spilling it everywhere.

1068
00:58:44,366 --> 00:58:49,743
I... got... it.

1069
00:58:51,747 --> 00:58:53,010
Okay.

1070
00:58:56,917 --> 00:58:58,279
Follow me.

1071
00:59:04,023 --> 00:59:05,220
[wheezes]

1072
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:07,387
Alpha Trion!

1073
00:59:07,387 --> 00:59:10,225
You are still alive.
Would you look at that?

1074
00:59:11,096 --> 00:59:13,030
You look horrible.

1075
00:59:13,802 --> 00:59:18,167
Traitor.
You are a disgrace.

1076
00:59:18,167 --> 00:59:21,434
Primus will surely--
Uh-huh. Yes. Shut up.

1077
00:59:21,434 --> 00:59:25,240
I seized an opportunity
to take control of my future.

1078
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:26,714
Anything to get
out of working for you

1079
00:59:26,714 --> 00:59:29,079
and that boring
council of elders.

1080
00:59:29,079 --> 00:59:31,279
Seriously,
I would watch you Primes

1081
00:59:31,279 --> 00:59:33,413
spend half the day
losing a war

1082
00:59:33,413 --> 00:59:38,253
and the other half
sitting around waxing poetic
about loyalty and honor.

1083
00:59:38,253 --> 00:59:39,551
And now look at you.

1084
00:59:39,551 --> 00:59:43,390
Hear my words:
You will fall.

1085
00:59:43,390 --> 00:59:45,458
And a new Prime will rise--

1086
00:59:45,458 --> 00:59:46,998
There you go again.

1087
00:59:46,998 --> 00:59:49,935
I don't want to listen
to any more speeches.

1088
00:59:49,935 --> 00:59:51,266
[groans]

1089
00:59:51,266 --> 00:59:52,740
There were others
in the cave with you.

1090
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:53,807
Who are they?

1091
00:59:53,807 --> 00:59:56,942
They are to be your undoing.

1092
00:59:56,942 --> 01:00:01,375
You've lost, Sentinel.
Nothing you can do--

1093
01:00:01,375 --> 01:00:03,949
[pained grunt]
[electrical crackling]

1094
01:00:05,084 --> 01:00:06,248
[body thuds]

1095
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:10,483
Oh, didn't I just say
no speeches?

1096
01:00:10,483 --> 01:00:12,122
You heard me, right?

1097
01:00:12,122 --> 01:00:14,553
This is what I'm talking about.
Unbelievable.

1098
01:00:14,553 --> 01:00:17,457
All of them are like that.
So disrespectful.

1099
01:00:18,097 --> 01:00:19,063
[sighs]

1100
01:00:19,063 --> 01:00:21,296
Okay. Hunt down the others.

1101
01:00:21,296 --> 01:00:22,638
With pleasure.

1102
01:00:31,946 --> 01:00:34,474
[engines humming]

1103
01:00:39,283 --> 01:00:40,480
Hey, buddy.

1104
01:00:41,153 --> 01:00:42,515
Oh. Hey.

1105
01:00:44,189 --> 01:00:47,322
You've been a little quiet.
Are you all right?

1106
01:00:47,322 --> 01:00:51,656
All I can think about
is Sentinel's smirking face.

1107
01:00:51,656 --> 01:00:55,495
He must pay for what he's done.
Someone has to do something.

1108
01:00:55,495 --> 01:00:59,708
We are. With Alpha's proof
inside that device,
we will show everyone the truth.

1109
01:00:59,708 --> 01:01:02,810
You honestly believe
it'll be that easy?

1110
01:01:02,810 --> 01:01:04,812
Iacon doesn't want
to hear the truth.

1111
01:01:04,812 --> 01:01:07,078
They worship Sentinel.

1112
01:01:07,078 --> 01:01:09,113
There's got to be
a better way
to bring him down.

1113
01:01:09,113 --> 01:01:11,819
We have to trust everyone will
believe what we show them.

1114
01:01:11,819 --> 01:01:13,920
I trusted Sentinel!

1115
01:01:14,516 --> 01:01:15,614
With everything.

1116
01:01:16,793 --> 01:01:22,093
I will never trust
a so-called leader ever again.

1117
01:01:24,691 --> 01:01:26,427
There's only one bot
I know I can trust--

1118
01:01:26,427 --> 01:01:27,626
[electrical crackling]

1119
01:01:27,626 --> 01:01:28,935
[grunting]

1120
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:30,299
[electronic sputtering]

1121
01:01:37,077 --> 01:01:39,275
[voice] All right,
wake them up.

1122
01:01:39,275 --> 01:01:40,705
[gasps]

1123
01:01:40,705 --> 01:01:42,278
[breathes heavily]

1124
01:01:47,087 --> 01:01:48,482
[grunts]

1125
01:02:02,201 --> 01:02:05,466
Now, are you spies

1126
01:02:06,601 --> 01:02:09,778
or just incompetent lackeys?

1127
01:02:09,778 --> 01:02:12,605
We're not spies.
But he is incompetent.

1128
01:02:12,605 --> 01:02:16,950
Scanning electrical impulses.
He speaks the truth.

1129
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:21,515
That just means
he believes himself,
like any spy would.

1130
01:02:21,515 --> 01:02:23,517
[muffled indistinct speech]

1131
01:02:23,517 --> 01:02:26,058
Uh, why is he gagged?

1132
01:02:26,058 --> 01:02:27,752
He wouldn't stop talking.

1133
01:02:27,752 --> 01:02:29,292
[muffled speech continues]
Even when he was
unconscious?

1134
01:02:29,292 --> 01:02:31,525
Especially when
he was unconscious!

1135
01:02:31,525 --> 01:02:32,768
Enough!

1136
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:35,364
Two options for you!

1137
01:02:35,364 --> 01:02:40,072
One, we slowly
dismantle each of you
one bolt and screw at a time,

1138
01:02:40,072 --> 01:02:42,734
and really make sure
you feel it.

1139
01:02:42,734 --> 01:02:43,878
Or two:

1140
01:02:43,878 --> 01:02:45,671
In exchange
for a quick death,

1141
01:02:45,671 --> 01:02:48,113
you give us intel
on the Energon trains,

1142
01:02:48,113 --> 01:02:50,115
access to the mines

1143
01:02:50,115 --> 01:02:53,822
or anything else that could
hurt your boss, Sentinel Prime.

1144
01:02:53,822 --> 01:02:55,351
Who exactly are you guys?

1145
01:02:55,351 --> 01:02:57,056
[muffled grunting, straining]

1146
01:02:57,056 --> 01:02:58,123
Ah!

1147
01:02:58,123 --> 01:03:01,192
The Cybertronian High Guard!

1148
01:03:01,192 --> 01:03:03,095
[growls] I told you
it wasn't tight enough!

1149
01:03:03,095 --> 01:03:06,230
Prestigious defenders
of Iacon.
Prestigious?

1150
01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:08,969
He's right.
I read all about you
in the archives.

1151
01:03:08,969 --> 01:03:12,401
You were
the most legendary warriors
in all of Cybertron.

1152
01:03:12,401 --> 01:03:14,205
Look, look, look!
That's Starscream,

1153
01:03:14,205 --> 01:03:17,109
and you're Shockwave,
and Soundwave.

1154
01:03:17,109 --> 01:03:19,738
Raise your hand
if "wave" is in your name.
There's a lot of "waves."

1155
01:03:19,738 --> 01:03:21,311
Silence!

1156
01:03:21,311 --> 01:03:23,445
The yellow annoying one
is correct.

1157
01:03:23,445 --> 01:03:24,446
Whoo!

1158
01:03:24,446 --> 01:03:26,283
We were once the High Guard.

1159
01:03:26,283 --> 01:03:30,023
We witnessed
Sentinel's betrayal,
saw the Primes fall.

1160
01:03:30,023 --> 01:03:32,927
Since that day, we've been
fighting from the shadows,

1161
01:03:32,927 --> 01:03:35,655
doing whatever we can
to sabotage Sentinel.

1162
01:03:35,655 --> 01:03:37,393
That's great! We're--
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1163
01:03:37,393 --> 01:03:41,100
Okay, okay.
We're good.
Everyone relax.

1164
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:43,597
I'm just saying we're allies.

1165
01:03:43,597 --> 01:03:45,665
We were on our way
back to Iacon,

1166
01:03:45,665 --> 01:03:49,735
and now with your help,
we can unify Cybertron
against Sentinel Prime.

1167
01:03:49,735 --> 01:03:53,882
The idea of a unified
Cybertron is a myth.

1168
01:03:53,882 --> 01:03:58,744
All that counts is the strength
of one bot over another!

1169
01:03:58,744 --> 01:04:00,713
[all cheering]

1170
01:04:00,713 --> 01:04:03,617
Okay. So, these guys
are a little intense.

1171
01:04:03,617 --> 01:04:05,553
Yeah. Just a little.

1172
01:04:05,553 --> 01:04:06,928
Hey!

1173
01:04:06,928 --> 01:04:08,490
What are you doing?

1174
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:13,726
I tell you
what I'm not doing.

1175
01:04:13,726 --> 01:04:17,664
I'm not cowering
in some busted ship,
playing king of the throne.

1176
01:04:17,664 --> 01:04:19,864
I'm not pretending
like I'm making a difference

1177
01:04:19,864 --> 01:04:22,603
by throwing one punch
and then running away to hide!

1178
01:04:22,603 --> 01:04:24,869
I found out
that Sentinel is rotten today,

1179
01:04:24,869 --> 01:04:26,871
and I'm gonna
make him pay for it.

1180
01:04:26,871 --> 01:04:28,378
Today!

1181
01:04:28,378 --> 01:04:31,986
You think you can insult me
and just walk away?

1182
01:04:31,986 --> 01:04:36,023
No one leaves here
unless I say so.

1183
01:04:36,023 --> 01:04:37,684
[chuckles] Is that right?

1184
01:04:38,687 --> 01:04:40,852
Well, how can you say so

1185
01:04:40,852 --> 01:04:42,821
with my head in your teeth?

1186
01:04:42,821 --> 01:04:44,493
[grunts]
D!

1187
01:04:44,493 --> 01:04:46,891
[grunts]
[excited chatter]

1188
01:04:46,891 --> 01:04:48,101
[both grunting]

1189
01:04:51,403 --> 01:04:52,435
Whoa!

1190
01:04:52,435 --> 01:04:54,074
[grunting]
[mechanical whir]

1191
01:04:54,074 --> 01:04:55,702
[growls]
[grunts]

1192
01:04:57,574 --> 01:04:58,903
Hit me!

1193
01:04:58,903 --> 01:05:02,181
Do it! Come on! Yeah, more!
[crowd cheers]

1194
01:05:02,181 --> 01:05:05,712
[laughs]
[all] D-16! D-16! D-16!

1195
01:05:07,914 --> 01:05:12,884
You want to see the strength
of one bot over another? Huh?

1196
01:05:12,884 --> 01:05:14,963
[voice crackling] Is that
all you've got, tough bot?

1197
01:05:14,963 --> 01:05:17,757
Let's go! Do it! Come on!

1198
01:05:17,757 --> 01:05:20,793
[yells angrily]

1199
01:05:20,793 --> 01:05:22,564
[mechanical whirring]

1200
01:05:29,771 --> 01:05:31,474
[panting]

1201
01:05:35,414 --> 01:05:37,480
Please! I beg you!

1202
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:40,318
Stop!
D, he's not the enemy!

1203
01:05:42,652 --> 01:05:44,784
Bear witness!

1204
01:05:44,784 --> 01:05:47,589
This is the last time
I show mercy!

1205
01:05:47,589 --> 01:05:50,262
Decide right now:

1206
01:05:50,262 --> 01:05:54,893
You can stay here in hiding,
bowing before
your pathetic leader,

1207
01:05:54,893 --> 01:05:58,237
or follow me
as we march on Iacon

1208
01:05:58,237 --> 01:06:01,801
and I take down Sentinel
once and for all!

1209
01:06:01,801 --> 01:06:04,276
[cheers, chanting]

1210
01:06:04,276 --> 01:06:08,874
[all] D-16! D-16! D-16!

1211
01:06:08,874 --> 01:06:10,909
[chanting fades]

1212
01:06:18,655 --> 01:06:20,028
[distant rumbling]

1213
01:06:22,890 --> 01:06:24,659
[all screaming]

1214
01:06:28,665 --> 01:06:30,368
[laserfire pulsing]

1215
01:06:35,738 --> 01:06:36,968
B, come on!

1216
01:06:37,542 --> 01:06:39,146
[B-127 yelling]

1217
01:06:46,012 --> 01:06:47,484
[mechanical whirring]

1218
01:06:55,560 --> 01:06:56,856
[grunts]

1219
01:07:01,995 --> 01:07:04,765
[Airachnid] Engage all hostiles!
I've got the bridge!

1220
01:07:21,553 --> 01:07:23,058
[grunts angrily]

1221
01:07:24,017 --> 01:07:25,423
[D-16 yelling]

1222
01:07:29,363 --> 01:07:30,890
[mechanical whirring]

1223
01:07:33,532 --> 01:07:34,399
[grunts]

1224
01:07:36,535 --> 01:07:37,435
Elita, get down!

1225
01:07:41,474 --> 01:07:42,539
[grunts]

1226
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:58,984
[Orion coughs, clears throat]

1227
01:08:00,053 --> 01:08:02,691
I feel like someone
dropped a cliff on me.

1228
01:08:02,691 --> 01:08:05,232
[groans]
Where are the others?

1229
01:08:05,232 --> 01:08:09,027
Sentinel's troops
took as many prisoners
as they could carry.

1230
01:08:09,027 --> 01:08:10,831
They got D-16 and B.

1231
01:08:10,831 --> 01:08:12,701
Oh, no.

1232
01:08:12,701 --> 01:08:15,275
And half of those
High-Guard nutjobs.

1233
01:08:16,135 --> 01:08:17,277
[sighs]

1234
01:08:17,277 --> 01:08:19,004
Our proof.

1235
01:08:19,004 --> 01:08:20,445
It's gone.

1236
01:08:21,316 --> 01:08:23,580
So, what do we do now?

1237
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:25,186
D was right.

1238
01:08:25,186 --> 01:08:27,782
About what?
Everything.

1239
01:08:27,782 --> 01:08:31,423
Look at it. Look around.
This is a disaster.

1240
01:08:31,986 --> 01:08:33,161
It's all my fault.

1241
01:08:33,161 --> 01:08:35,086
I should have
stayed on protocol.

1242
01:08:36,562 --> 01:08:37,594
[sighs]

1243
01:08:41,369 --> 01:08:44,766
Listen to me.
I really want you to hear this.

1244
01:08:44,766 --> 01:08:45,833
Are you listening?

1245
01:08:48,442 --> 01:08:49,837
I'm better than you.

1246
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,477
Yeah, okay,
I'm hearing you.

1247
01:08:53,348 --> 01:08:55,106
I'm better than you
in every way,

1248
01:08:55,106 --> 01:08:57,614
except you have hope.

1249
01:08:57,614 --> 01:09:01,321
You always have. You went back
into the mine to rescue Jazz.

1250
01:09:01,321 --> 01:09:05,292
You snuck up
to the surface to find
the Matrix of Leadership.

1251
01:09:05,292 --> 01:09:07,118
[chuckles] Yeah,
and how'd that work out?

1252
01:09:07,118 --> 01:09:08,889
My point is,

1253
01:09:08,889 --> 01:09:13,157
that your instincts tell you
to break protocol for a reason.

1254
01:09:13,157 --> 01:09:16,270
This blind optimism
that you have

1255
01:09:16,270 --> 01:09:20,637
is why you make such bold
and courageous choices,

1256
01:09:21,706 --> 01:09:23,508
that are also extremely stupid.

1257
01:09:23,508 --> 01:09:26,071
First time
giving a pep talk?

1258
01:09:26,071 --> 01:09:27,842
You're inspiring.

1259
01:09:27,842 --> 01:09:31,219
You can envision a better future
that no one else can see.

1260
01:09:32,288 --> 01:09:35,322
And if we ever want to see
B and D-16 again,

1261
01:09:35,322 --> 01:09:39,359
that is the Orion Pax
that we need right now.

1262
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:41,592
Listen to me.

1263
01:09:42,496 --> 01:09:43,693
We can do this.

1264
01:09:45,730 --> 01:09:49,369
Those Energon trains
will be heading
back to Iacon.

1265
01:09:49,369 --> 01:09:52,097
If we intercepted one--

1266
01:09:52,097 --> 01:09:55,309
Hell yes, I can reroute it.
What else do we need?

1267
01:09:55,309 --> 01:10:00,039
Well, my bold instincts tell me
we have to recruit some nutjobs.

1268
01:10:02,076 --> 01:10:04,384
I was afraid
you'd say that.

1269
01:10:04,384 --> 01:10:07,981
Uh, Shockwave, Soundwave.
You in the back.

1270
01:10:07,981 --> 01:10:11,259
In order to save
our captured friends,
we have to act now.

1271
01:10:11,259 --> 01:10:13,558
How about I blast you
back to Iacon?

1272
01:10:13,558 --> 01:10:16,990
[pained grunt]
Oh! She punched me in my eye!

1273
01:10:16,990 --> 01:10:20,235
Everyone, shut up!
All of you. Listen to him.

1274
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:24,063
Most likely, our friends
are being held captive

1275
01:10:24,063 --> 01:10:25,735
at the top
of Sentinel's tower.

1276
01:10:25,735 --> 01:10:28,771
A surprise attack would
give us a chance to rescue them.

1277
01:10:28,771 --> 01:10:33,743
Impossible. We do not
have enough soldiers
or a way inside.

1278
01:10:33,743 --> 01:10:36,911
Elita will get us in.
And I will get more troops.

1279
01:10:36,911 --> 01:10:38,550
Why should we follow you?

1280
01:10:39,718 --> 01:10:41,388
We will follow you.

1281
01:10:41,388 --> 01:10:44,622
Attention, High Guard.
Prepare for battle.

1282
01:10:44,622 --> 01:10:46,657
What is our first move?

1283
01:10:46,657 --> 01:10:47,823
[quietly] We roll out.

1284
01:10:49,398 --> 01:10:50,430
What?

1285
01:10:50,430 --> 01:10:51,860
Louder.

1286
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:54,302
[boldly]
Transform and roll out!

1287
01:11:04,204 --> 01:11:07,843
I don't understand.
Why are we still alive?

1288
01:11:07,843 --> 01:11:11,451
Look at this rowdy bunch!
The High Guard!

1289
01:11:11,451 --> 01:11:13,321
You know, you guys
have been tough to find.

1290
01:11:13,321 --> 01:11:16,918
Every trip to the surface,
I've been searching for you.

1291
01:11:16,918 --> 01:11:19,459
Tracking the bots in the cave
led me right to them.

1292
01:11:19,459 --> 01:11:20,790
Oh-ho-ho!

1293
01:11:20,790 --> 01:11:23,727
You captured Starscream!
It was too easy.

1294
01:11:23,727 --> 01:11:25,927
[high-pitch]
I'm going to rip you apart
piece by piece

1295
01:11:25,927 --> 01:11:27,434
so that your death
is painful!
[laughs]

1296
01:11:27,434 --> 01:11:28,732
You'll regret
the day you were--

1297
01:11:28,732 --> 01:11:30,701
You sound ridiculous.
It's weird.

1298
01:11:30,701 --> 01:11:33,737
Oh, D-16,
what a tragic story you'll be.

1299
01:11:33,737 --> 01:11:37,642
Atop the leaderboard
in your sector
and secretly a traitor.

1300
01:11:37,642 --> 01:11:39,743
I'm not a traitor.
You're the traitor.

1301
01:11:39,743 --> 01:11:42,482
Nuh-uh. You, all of you,
are traitors.

1302
01:11:42,482 --> 01:11:46,178
You've been working
with the Quintessons
to sabotage my expeditions.

1303
01:11:46,178 --> 01:11:48,620
You're the reason
why I haven't found
the Matrix of Leadership yet.

1304
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:49,918
None of that is true!

1305
01:11:49,918 --> 01:11:51,524
Oh, trust me,
it'll be very true

1306
01:11:51,524 --> 01:11:54,461
when I'm executing you
in front of all of Iacon.

1307
01:11:54,461 --> 01:11:58,289
Because down here,
the truth is what I make it.

1308
01:11:58,289 --> 01:11:59,334
[thud reverberates]

1309
01:12:07,036 --> 01:12:09,443
Well, well.
What's this about?

1310
01:12:10,303 --> 01:12:13,007
I'm not kneeling
in front of you.

1311
01:12:13,007 --> 01:12:14,976
Feeling confident, are we?

1312
01:12:14,976 --> 01:12:18,210
You don't scare me.
You want to know why?

1313
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:19,310
Please.

1314
01:12:20,522 --> 01:12:23,556
Because I don't have
anything left to lose.

1315
01:12:23,556 --> 01:12:25,723
You took it all.

1316
01:12:27,089 --> 01:12:28,462
I sure did.

1317
01:12:28,462 --> 01:12:29,859
[grunts]

1318
01:12:29,859 --> 01:12:31,531
[gasps]
[groans]

1319
01:12:31,531 --> 01:12:33,929
Ah, Megatronus Prime.

1320
01:12:35,328 --> 01:12:38,406
Of course you were a fan.
Megatronus was
the coolest Prime!

1321
01:12:38,406 --> 01:12:41,299
The biggest!
The baddest! The toughest!

1322
01:12:42,544 --> 01:12:44,775
That's why,
after I killed him,

1323
01:12:45,811 --> 01:12:48,042
I took his cog for myself.

1324
01:12:48,042 --> 01:12:50,550
He was greater
than you'll ever be!

1325
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:52,849
I don't know. I'm pretty great.

1326
01:12:52,849 --> 01:12:55,720
But I can understand why you'd
want to wear his face over mine.

1327
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:56,787
Here.

1328
01:12:58,021 --> 01:13:01,253
Let's make sure
it doesn't come off.

1329
01:13:01,253 --> 01:13:02,793
[electrical crackling]

1330
01:13:02,793 --> 01:13:06,027
[pained shouts, groans]

1331
01:13:20,010 --> 01:13:22,549
Okay. [sighs]

1332
01:13:22,549 --> 01:13:25,112
[stammers] I can do this.

1333
01:13:38,765 --> 01:13:42,261
[miner] You can't be serious.
We just worked
22 shifts without a break!

1334
01:13:42,261 --> 01:13:43,999
These miners need rest
and time to repair and--

1335
01:13:43,999 --> 01:13:46,298
Sentinel Prime
wants more Energon.

1336
01:13:46,298 --> 01:13:49,741
So get back in the mines
before I make you
get back in the--

1337
01:13:49,741 --> 01:13:50,907
[aggressive thud]

1338
01:13:53,373 --> 01:13:55,406
[triumphant electronic jingle]

1339
01:13:55,406 --> 01:13:57,408
Who was that?
Did you see
who that was?

1340
01:13:57,408 --> 01:13:58,618
[miner] That can't be him.

1341
01:13:58,618 --> 01:13:59,718
[Jazz] Is that...

1342
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:02,413
It can't be.

1343
01:14:02,413 --> 01:14:04,954
Orion?
Jazz.

1344
01:14:04,954 --> 01:14:06,384
Is it really you?

1345
01:14:06,384 --> 01:14:08,793
Yeah, I know I, uh,
look a little different.

1346
01:14:08,793 --> 01:14:10,388
"Little"?

1347
01:14:10,388 --> 01:14:12,225
There's nothing
"little" about you.

1348
01:14:12,225 --> 01:14:14,095
Uh, how is this possible?

1349
01:14:14,095 --> 01:14:16,933
Sentinel told us you died
from your race injuries.

1350
01:14:17,771 --> 01:14:19,903
Sentinel is a liar.

1351
01:14:19,903 --> 01:14:21,938
What?
Huh?

1352
01:14:21,938 --> 01:14:24,105
Look, I know how this will sound
coming from me.

1353
01:14:24,105 --> 01:14:27,614
I was never
the most focused miner.

1354
01:14:27,614 --> 01:14:30,078
But as you can see,
everything is different now.

1355
01:14:30,078 --> 01:14:31,981
[mechanical whirring]

1356
01:14:37,923 --> 01:14:42,156
I went to the surface
and I learned the truth.

1357
01:14:43,632 --> 01:14:45,291
My friends,

1358
01:14:45,291 --> 01:14:49,394
we were all born
with transformation cogs.

1359
01:14:50,430 --> 01:14:53,607
And then Sentinel,
he stole them from us.

1360
01:14:53,607 --> 01:14:57,006
He took away our ability
to make our own decisions.

1361
01:14:57,006 --> 01:14:59,173
He stole our freedom.

1362
01:15:02,981 --> 01:15:08,820
But now, I'm offering you
your first real choice.

1363
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:12,956
You can work a 23rd shift
and mine yourself to death

1364
01:15:14,663 --> 01:15:17,488
or fight back
against Sentinel with me.

1365
01:15:18,029 --> 01:15:20,161
Right now.

1366
01:15:20,161 --> 01:15:23,538
How are we supposed to do that?
We can't fight.
We don't have cogs.

1367
01:15:25,872 --> 01:15:29,808
What defines a Transformer
is not the cog in its chest

1368
01:15:29,808 --> 01:15:32,778
but the spark
that resides in their core.

1369
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:36,947
A spark that gives you the will
to make your world better.

1370
01:15:36,947 --> 01:15:40,819
And that spark,
Sentinel can never
take from us.

1371
01:15:40,819 --> 01:15:43,217
There's not enough of us.
We'd need an army.

1372
01:15:43,217 --> 01:15:46,990
And we have one.
Elita is bringing troops.

1373
01:15:46,990 --> 01:15:49,058
We are not alone in this.

1374
01:15:49,058 --> 01:15:51,863
If we want to be in control
of our own destiny,

1375
01:15:51,863 --> 01:15:53,524
we will have to
fight for it.

1376
01:15:53,524 --> 01:15:56,901
Now is the time
for us to stand up...

1377
01:15:56,901 --> 01:15:58,903
[supportive chatter]
...for ourselves.

1378
01:15:58,903 --> 01:16:00,333

1379
01:16:01,237 --> 01:16:03,171
Stand up for this injustice.

[cheers growing]

1381
01:16:05,371 --> 01:16:09,078
I promise you
this fight will be worth it.

1382
01:16:10,015 --> 01:16:11,751
Follow me.

1383
01:16:11,751 --> 01:16:14,655
Nothing can stop us
when we stand together.

1384
01:16:14,655 --> 01:16:18,186
[cheering, chanting]
Together as one.

1385

1387
01:16:25,193 --> 01:16:26,524
You got it.

1388
01:16:26,524 --> 01:16:28,801
Buckle up, Blinky.
We're going in.

[determined groans]

1391
01:16:42,212 --> 01:16:43,442
Not a good idea.

1392
01:16:45,611 --> 01:16:47,787
[whispering]
D, stay down.
[groans]

1393
01:16:59,592 --> 01:17:01,427
Well, that's a shame.
[mechanical whirs]

1394
01:17:01,427 --> 01:17:03,396
You really were
a great miner.

1395
01:17:07,908 --> 01:17:10,337
We've got a breach!
Protect Sentinel!

[grunts]

1397
01:17:19,579 --> 01:17:22,151
They spotted us.
It's about to get bumpy.

1398
01:17:23,088 --> 01:17:24,791
High Guard, eject.

1399
01:17:24,791 --> 01:17:26,760
Come on! Move out!

1400
01:17:27,323 --> 01:17:28,487
[laserfire pulsing]

1401
01:17:41,634 --> 01:17:43,777

There's too many.
We have to abort!

1402
01:17:44,670 --> 01:17:47,308
[yelps]
[alarm intensifying]

1403
01:17:49,411 --> 01:17:50,476
We're not gonna make it.

[all yelling]

1405
01:17:53,349 --> 01:17:54,315
Whoo-hoo!

1406
01:17:54,315 --> 01:17:55,921
Metal to the pedal, miners!

1407
01:17:55,921 --> 01:17:57,681
Let's break some protocol!

1408
01:17:57,681 --> 01:17:59,452
[Elita] That's what
I'm talking about, Pax!

1409

Whoa! That's intense.

1412
01:18:11,365 --> 01:18:16,073
You can't win, miner.
I see everything!

1413
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:18,977
That's right, you do.

1414
01:18:18,977 --> 01:18:21,716
Except the tower we're
about to crash into.

1415
01:18:34,687 --> 01:18:36,357

What's going on?

1416
01:18:39,164 --> 01:18:40,526
[electronic charge]

1417
01:18:40,526 --> 01:18:41,736
[Orion] Hey!

1418
01:18:47,205 --> 01:18:49,007
What has he done to you?

1419
01:18:49,007 --> 01:18:51,878
This is nothing compared to
what I'm gonna do to Sentinel.

1420
01:18:52,815 --> 01:18:55,079
[Orion] Soundwave,
free the prisoners.

1421

[electronic throbbing]

1422
01:18:59,745 --> 01:19:02,086
I know how to stop him.
Airachnid is the answer.

1423
01:19:02,086 --> 01:19:03,857
I'm doing this my way.
D!

1424
01:19:09,392 --> 01:19:10,424
Yes!

1425
01:19:10,424 --> 01:19:11,491
Whoa!
[metal clangs]

1426
01:19:11,491 --> 01:19:13,031
Whoa-ho-ho!

1427
01:19:13,031 --> 01:19:14,395

Elita! Battle mask!

1430
01:19:18,069 --> 01:19:21,039
It appeared
when this guy tried to--

1431
01:19:21,039 --> 01:19:23,074
Knife hands?
I have knife hands!

1432
01:19:26,079 --> 01:19:27,144
What the--?

1435

Where's Sentinel?
[both grunt]

1436
01:19:41,864 --> 01:19:43,963
[Sentinel]
You pathetic little twits.

1437
01:19:43,963 --> 01:19:48,297
Did you really think
that you could knock down
everything I've built?

1438
01:19:48,297 --> 01:19:52,136
It's over, Sentinel.
You can't escape the truth.
[Sentinel] What truth?

1439
01:19:52,136 --> 01:19:54,842
That I plucked the cogs
from your newborn chests?

1440
01:19:54,842 --> 01:19:57,042
Forced you to mine
so that I could pay off
the Quintessons

1441
01:19:57,042 --> 01:19:58,406
and live like a king?

1442
01:19:58,406 --> 01:20:01,409
None of that matters!
Because the truth...

1443
01:20:01,409 --> 01:20:05,413
[mechanical whirring]
...is what I make it.

1444
01:20:07,615 --> 01:20:08,515

He's too strong.
I have a plan.

1448
01:20:17,095 --> 01:20:19,295
We need Airachnid.
Airachnid?

1449
01:20:19,295 --> 01:20:21,561
We need her memory.
Where is she?

1450
01:20:21,561 --> 01:20:23,167
Found her! [yells]

1451
01:20:24,698 --> 01:20:25,664

1452
01:20:26,535 --> 01:20:27,941
<i>Do not break her.</i>

1453
01:20:27,941 --> 01:20:29,272
<i>Bring her
to the broadcast station.</i>

Relax! I'm being very gentle.

1460
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:03,009
Orion! Orion, look!
I have knife hands!

1461
01:21:03,009 --> 01:21:04,604
I can see that.

1462
01:21:04,604 --> 01:21:06,804
I'm gonna cut these guys.
Watch. Come here!

1463
01:21:06,804 --> 01:21:08,674
You can jab them later.
We got to go.

1464
01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:13,052

You can't be in here.

B!

1471
01:21:43,511 --> 01:21:46,349
These are not
the bad guys.
Why did you cut the door?

1472
01:21:46,349 --> 01:21:48,989
What? No, I didn't--
That was an-- I--

1473
01:21:48,989 --> 01:21:50,617
It was already like that.
Right?

1474
01:21:50,617 --> 01:21:51,959
Yes, that's right.
That's right, yes.

01:27:14,072 --> 01:27:17,207
<i>your noble sacrifice
for the greater good</i>

1546
01:27:17,207 --> 01:27:21,255
<i>has proven you worthy
in the eyes of Primus.</i>

1547
01:27:22,049 --> 01:27:24,522
<i>He entrusts in you</i>

1548
01:27:24,522 --> 01:27:27,426
the future of Cybertron

1549
01:27:27,426 --> 01:27:33,058
and the Matrix of Leadership!

1550
01:27:33,058 --> 01:27:34,257
[crowd clamoring]

1551
01:27:34,257 --> 01:27:37,667
I will lead us all
into the future!

1552
01:27:41,805 --> 01:27:44,278
[electrical crackling]

1553
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:55,751
I...

1554
01:27:56,523 --> 01:27:57,588
am...

1555
01:27:58,459 --> 01:28:00,294
Megatron!

1556
01:28:00,989 --> 01:28:02,923
[Alpha Trion] <i>Arise...</i>

1557
01:28:03,629 --> 01:28:06,058
<i>Optimus Prime.</i>

1558
01:28:09,030 --> 01:28:10,931
Burn it down!

1559
01:28:11,604 --> 01:28:12,933
All of it!

1560
01:28:18,336 --> 01:28:21,513
All hail Megatron!

1561
01:28:23,418 --> 01:28:25,913
He's gonna kill everyone.
We have to stop him.
Come on.

1562
01:28:27,422 --> 01:28:29,114
Stop! It's over.

1563
01:28:29,114 --> 01:28:32,887
It's over when every last one
of his followers is dead!

1564
01:28:33,494 --> 01:28:34,526
[grunts]

1565
01:29:06,351 --> 01:29:07,823
Impossible.

1566
01:29:10,498 --> 01:29:14,357
Primus gave you the Matrix.

1567
01:29:14,357 --> 01:29:16,568
We could've built
the future together.

1568
01:29:16,568 --> 01:29:18,603
I'll build it myself.

1569
01:29:18,603 --> 01:29:22,200
After I tear down
everyone in my way!

1570
01:29:23,577 --> 01:29:25,038
[roars]

1571
01:29:40,088 --> 01:29:40,955
[pained grunt]

1572
01:29:42,387 --> 01:29:43,562
[roars]

1573
01:30:00,746 --> 01:30:01,943
[electronic charging]

1574
01:30:03,782 --> 01:30:04,814
Ah!

1575
01:30:06,884 --> 01:30:08,081
[growling]

1576
01:30:09,854 --> 01:30:11,788

[roars]

1580
01:31:01,004 --> 01:31:03,774
[panting heavily]

1581
01:31:06,944 --> 01:31:10,143
We were given the power
to change our world

1582
01:31:10,143 --> 01:31:12,651
and you chose to destroy it.

1583
01:31:12,651 --> 01:31:14,114
Just like Sentinel.

1584
01:31:14,114 --> 01:31:17,986
You have betrayed Cybertron
and its citizens.

1585
01:31:19,660 --> 01:31:22,452
And you betrayed me.

1586
01:31:33,531 --> 01:31:34,607
Go.

1587
01:31:35,467 --> 01:31:38,138
Take the High Guard
and leave.

1588
01:31:39,372 --> 01:31:42,978
You are banished from Iacon.

1589
01:31:47,853 --> 01:31:50,183
It didn't have to end
this way.

1590
01:31:52,517 --> 01:31:55,991
This isn't over, Prime.

1591
01:32:03,330 --> 01:32:05,902
High Guard, follow me!

1592
01:32:19,511 --> 01:32:22,050
[Optimus Prime] <i>The line
between friend and enemy</i>

1593
01:32:22,050 --> 01:32:25,218
<i>is not as clear
as I once believed.</i>

1594
01:32:25,218 --> 01:32:29,156
<i>Once it's crossed,
there's no going back.</i>

1595
01:32:29,156 --> 01:32:33,193
<i>Because some transformations
are permanent.</i>

1596
01:32:33,193 --> 01:32:35,063
[Orion] Hey, Megatronus Prime.
Nice.

1597
01:32:35,063 --> 01:32:37,230
Oh, yeah.
Well, he's my hero.

1598
01:32:37,230 --> 01:32:39,067
[both] The greatest Prime
to ever live.

1599
01:32:39,067 --> 01:32:40,805
[both laugh]

1600
01:32:40,805 --> 01:32:43,566
I'm D-16.
Orion Pax.

1601
01:32:43,566 --> 01:32:45,975
You ever mine Energon before?

1602
01:32:45,975 --> 01:32:47,372
No. You?

1603
01:32:47,372 --> 01:32:49,583
No. I hear it's dangerous.

1604
01:32:50,278 --> 01:32:51,684
Well, I'll tell you what.

1605
01:32:51,684 --> 01:32:54,214
You watch my back,
I promise to watch yours.

1606
01:32:54,214 --> 01:32:55,413
All right.

1607
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:58,251
Thanks, Pax.

1608
01:33:11,299 --> 01:33:13,596
A new beginning
for Cybertron.

1609
01:33:13,596 --> 01:33:15,708
And a new leader.

1610
01:33:15,708 --> 01:33:17,710
Yes, about that.

1611
01:33:17,710 --> 01:33:22,715
I could use some help
from a bot who is
better than me in every way.

1612
01:33:22,715 --> 01:33:24,684
Who, me? Oh, no, no.

1613
01:33:24,684 --> 01:33:27,082
I have a pretty sweet gig
working in waste management.

1614
01:33:27,082 --> 01:33:30,085
Well, Captain,
I do owe you a promotion.

1615
01:33:30,085 --> 01:33:32,857
How's Major Elita sound?

1616
01:33:32,857 --> 01:33:35,420
How about Commander?

1617
01:33:35,420 --> 01:33:37,389
[chuckles] Even better.

1618
01:33:37,389 --> 01:33:41,360
And I'm sorry, B,
but I cannot let you
go back to sublevel 50.

1619
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:43,197
I may be a Prime now,

1620
01:33:43,197 --> 01:33:44,935
but I'm gonna need you
by my side.

1621
01:33:44,935 --> 01:33:48,433
Are you serious?
This is the greatest
day of my life.

1622
01:33:48,433 --> 01:33:50,633
I get to work
for the government.

1623
01:33:50,633 --> 01:33:54,274
[shimmering tone]
Okay. So that's new.

1624
01:33:54,274 --> 01:33:55,946
I'm sorry,
what is happening?

1625
01:34:07,388 --> 01:34:09,421
[all cheering]

1626
01:34:26,374 --> 01:34:30,112
[Optimus Prime]
<i>And now we stand here
together as one...</i>

1627
01:34:32,512 --> 01:34:35,645
<i>proving we all have
the power to transform,</i>

1628
01:34:35,645 --> 01:34:38,890
<i>to become
who we were destined to be,</i>

1629
01:34:38,890 --> 01:34:43,587
<i>to right wrongs,
to make our world better.</i>

1630
01:34:43,587 --> 01:34:46,766
<i>Because here,
freedom and autonomy</i>

1631
01:34:46,766 --> 01:34:49,494
<i>are the rights
of all sentient beings.</i>

1632
01:34:50,596 --> 01:34:55,071
<i>Here,
all are truly Autobots.</i>

1633
01:34:56,536 --> 01:35:00,142
<i>This message is a warning
to all Quintessons.</i>

1634
01:35:00,142 --> 01:35:05,543
<i>If you dare
return to Cybertron,
the Autobots will be waiting.</i>

1635
01:35:05,543 --> 01:35:08,480
<i>I will be waiting.</i>

1636
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:12,319
<i>I am Optimus Prime.</i>

[door opens]
[rapid footsteps]

1638
01:35:40,182 --> 01:35:42,679
Hey, guys! Great news,
the Energon's back!

1639
01:35:42,679 --> 01:35:44,956
And I have a cog
and I can transform!

1640
01:35:44,956 --> 01:35:46,892
It's a long story.
I'll fill you in later.

1641
01:35:46,892 --> 01:35:50,456
Oh! And here's the best part.
My hands are straight-up knives.

1642
01:35:50,456 --> 01:35:52,293
Watch this. Knife hands!

1643
01:35:54,198 --> 01:35:55,230
No!

01:43:20,072 --> 01:43:23,975
[Megatron]
<i>Sentinel the betrayer is dead.</i>

1645
01:43:23,975 --> 01:43:27,715
<i>But his death has given life
to a new enemy.</i>

1646
01:43:27,715 --> 01:43:29,915
<i>A stronger enemy.</i>

1647
01:43:29,915 --> 01:43:32,049
<i>A personal enemy.</i>

1648
01:43:33,184 --> 01:43:37,362
<i>We will not be blinded
by his deception.</i>

1649
01:43:37,362 --> 01:43:40,024
<i>We are the ones who are...</i>

1650
01:43:40,862 --> 01:43:42,862
Decepticons!

1651
01:43:42,862 --> 01:43:44,699
Rise up!

1652
01:43:44,699 --> 01:43:48,197
[all] Rise up! Rise up!
