1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
and I am the fastest man alive.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
To the outside world, I'm an
ordinary forensic scientist,

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
In an attempt to stop the
evil speedster Savitar,

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I was accidentally
thrust into the future,

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
and I saw him murder
the woman that I love.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
But I won't let that happen.

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I'm gonna do everything in
my power to change the future,

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
and I'm the only one fast
enough to keep her alive.

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I am The Flash.

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,533
&nbsp

25
00:00:00,543 --> 00:00:02,107
Previously, on "The Flash"...

26
00:00:02,117 --> 00:00:02,132
&nbsp

27
00:00:02,142 --> 00:00:04,006
The night that Savitar kills you,

28
00:00:04,016 --> 00:00:04,031
&nbsp

29
00:00:04,041 --> 00:00:05,779
you didn't have a ring on your finger.

30
00:00:05,789 --> 00:00:05,804
&nbsp

31
00:00:05,814 --> 00:00:06,970
We weren't engaged yet.

32
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:06,973
&nbsp

33
00:00:06,983 --> 00:00:08,756
So you thought that if we were...

34
00:00:08,766 --> 00:00:08,758
&nbsp

35
00:00:08,768 --> 00:00:10,518
That it might change the future.

36
00:00:10,528 --> 00:00:10,542
&nbsp

37
00:00:10,552 --> 00:00:13,149
Now there's always gonna be
a part of us that's tainted.

38
00:00:13,159 --> 00:00:13,174
&nbsp

39
00:00:13,184 --> 00:00:15,735
Why is Savitar hiding
in the Speed Force?

40
00:00:15,745 --> 00:00:15,760
&nbsp

41
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:17,250
That's where the future you trapped him.

42
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:17,275
&nbsp

43
00:00:17,285 --> 00:00:18,696
- That's right.
- I have what I need...

44
00:00:18,706 --> 00:00:18,721
&nbsp

45
00:00:18,731 --> 00:00:20,600
... to escape my hell, Wallace.

46
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:20,602
&nbsp

47
00:00:20,612 --> 00:00:23,274
Not everything; we still
have a piece of that stone.

48
00:00:23,284 --> 00:00:23,299
&nbsp

49
00:00:23,309 --> 00:00:25,024
- It's gone?
- If Savitar gets ahold of the stone...

50
00:00:25,034 --> 00:00:25,049
&nbsp

51
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:26,272
He'll escape for sure.

52
00:00:26,282 --> 00:00:26,274
&nbsp

53
00:00:26,284 --> 00:00:28,907
You can't get rid of
that stone, Wallace.

54
00:00:28,917 --> 00:00:28,932
&nbsp

55
00:00:28,942 --> 00:00:31,895
You're not fast enough to
throw it into the Speed Force

56
00:00:31,905 --> 00:00:31,897
&nbsp

57
00:00:31,907 --> 00:00:33,369
by yourself.

58
00:00:33,379 --> 00:00:35,901
&nbsp

59
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:39,658
Wally has taken my
place in the Speed Force.

60
00:00:39,668 --> 00:00:42,166
&nbsp

61
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:43,873
We have to bring him
back. We have to save him.

62
00:00:43,883 --> 00:00:43,921
&nbsp

63
00:00:43,931 --> 00:00:46,322
My fear is the reason for all of this.

64
00:00:46,332 --> 00:00:48,564
&nbsp

65
00:00:48,574 --> 00:00:50,424
Savitar was right.

66
00:00:50,434 --> 00:00:50,449
&nbsp

67
00:00:50,459 --> 00:00:52,298
This is all because of me,

68
00:00:52,308 --> 00:00:52,300
&nbsp

69
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,300
because of my weakness.

70
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:54,486
&nbsp

71
00:00:54,496 --> 00:00:56,052
Flashpoint.

72
00:00:56,062 --> 00:00:56,054
&nbsp

73
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:58,722
And because of it,
everyone's lives have changed.

74
00:00:58,732 --> 00:00:58,724
&nbsp

75
00:00:58,734 --> 00:01:00,924
Everyone I love is suffering.

76
00:01:00,934 --> 00:01:00,926
&nbsp

77
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:02,932
This has to stop.

78
00:01:02,942 --> 00:01:02,957
&nbsp

79
00:01:02,967 --> 00:01:06,492
I can't let anyone hurt
anymore because of me.

80
00:01:06,502 --> 00:01:06,598
&nbsp

81
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:09,611
No one else should
have to pay for my sins.

82
00:01:09,621 --> 00:01:09,735
&nbsp

83
00:01:09,745 --> 00:01:11,568
And they won't.

84
00:01:11,578 --> 00:01:11,570
&nbsp

85
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,299
Ever again.

86
00:01:13,309 --> 00:01:13,939
&nbsp

87
00:01:13,949 --> 00:01:15,408
Cisco.

88
00:01:15,418 --> 00:01:16,191
&nbsp

89
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,274
Get the breach room ready.

90
00:01:18,284 --> 00:01:18,276
&nbsp

91
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,877
Okay, for what?

92
00:01:20,887 --> 00:01:21,296
&nbsp

93
00:01:21,306 --> 00:01:23,252
I'm gonna save Wally.

94
00:01:23,262 --> 00:01:24,189
&nbsp

95
00:01:24,199 --> 00:01:27,087
How exactly are you going to do that?

96
00:01:27,097 --> 00:01:27,369
&nbsp

97
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:29,619
I'm going back into the Speed Force.

98
00:01:29,629 --> 00:01:29,621

&nbsp

101
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,241
I'm just trying to wrap my mind around

102
00:01:36,251 --> 00:01:36,266
&nbsp

103
00:01:36,276 --> 00:01:38,321
you going into the Speed Force again.

104
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:38,346
&nbsp

105
00:01:38,356 --> 00:01:40,180
The Savitar said he was there for years.

106
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:40,182
&nbsp

107
00:01:40,192 --> 00:01:42,908
You said it was like being in space.

108
00:01:42,918 --> 00:01:42,933
&nbsp

109
00:01:42,943 --> 00:01:44,217
- I know.
- So what are you gonna do?

110
00:01:44,227 --> 00:01:44,219
&nbsp

111
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,970
You gonna run in there and
run around till you find him?

112
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:46,972
&nbsp

113
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,855
- It's endless.
- I know.

114
00:01:48,865 --> 00:01:48,857
&nbsp

115
00:01:48,867 --> 00:01:50,759
And this is the only way to save Wally.

116
00:01:50,769 --> 00:01:50,784
&nbsp

117
00:01:50,794 --> 00:01:53,143
Yeah, yeah, I just... we need a plan.

118
00:01:53,153 --> 00:01:53,145
&nbsp

119
00:01:53,155 --> 00:01:54,659
I... I...

120
00:01:54,669 --> 00:01:55,647
&nbsp

121
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,647
I don't wanna lose both my sons.

122
00:01:57,657 --> 00:01:57,649
&nbsp

123
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:00,361
Look, gang, I don't
understand the Speed Force,

124
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:00,386
&nbsp

125
00:02:00,396 --> 00:02:03,572
but there are plenty of
people in this room who do.

126
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:03,597
&nbsp

127
00:02:03,607 --> 00:02:05,572
Am I correct in assuming
there's a point coming?

128
00:02:05,582 --> 00:02:05,574
&nbsp

129
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:08,237
My point is why can't
you use your knowledge

130
00:02:08,247 --> 00:02:08,262
&nbsp

131
00:02:08,272 --> 00:02:11,190
to fashion some kind of safety
precaution for young BA right here,

132
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:11,215
&nbsp

133
00:02:11,225 --> 00:02:13,994
so that, while he's in the
Speed Force, he doesn't get lost.

134
00:02:14,004 --> 00:02:14,019
&nbsp

135
00:02:14,029 --> 00:02:16,259
Oh, so you're saying I can just whip up

136
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:16,284
&nbsp

137
00:02:16,294 --> 00:02:17,767
some kind of inter-dimensional tether

138
00:02:17,777 --> 00:02:17,792
&nbsp

139
00:02:17,802 --> 00:02:20,003
to just anchor him to the Universe?

140
00:02:20,013 --> 00:02:20,005
&nbsp

141
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:21,304
Yeah.

142
00:02:21,314 --> 00:02:21,306
&nbsp

143
00:02:21,316 --> 00:02:23,923
- That's exactly what I can do.
- Yeah!

144
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:23,925
&nbsp

145
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,508
Now we're cooking with helium.

146
00:02:25,518 --> 00:02:25,510
&nbsp

147
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,594
Yes, and I can... I can
add a biological component

148
00:02:27,604 --> 00:02:27,596
&nbsp

149
00:02:27,606 --> 00:02:29,698
that will measure his vitals
when he's in the Speed Force.

150
00:02:29,708 --> 00:02:29,723
&nbsp

151
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,890
- That's a great idea.
- Thank you, Caitlin.

152
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:31,915
&nbsp

153
00:02:31,925 --> 00:02:33,426
Because if we can
monitor Barry's vitals,

154
00:02:33,436 --> 00:02:33,451
&nbsp

155
00:02:33,461 --> 00:02:35,871
we'll know if they fluctuate,
and we can pull him out.

156
00:02:35,881 --> 00:02:35,896
&nbsp

157
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,621
You mean "pull us out."

158
00:02:37,631 --> 00:02:37,890
&nbsp

159
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,923
Yeah, if you're going in
there to save Wally, so am I.

160
00:02:39,933 --> 00:02:39,948
&nbsp

161
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,379
Jesse, you're gonna stay here.

162
00:02:41,389 --> 00:02:41,404
&nbsp

163
00:02:41,414 --> 00:02:44,541
Because if your father finds out
you're lost in some negative world,

164
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:44,566
&nbsp

165
00:02:44,576 --> 00:02:47,363
the first person to get
a broken schnoz is me.

166
00:02:47,373 --> 00:02:47,388
&nbsp

167
00:02:47,398 --> 00:02:49,683
- There's a negative world?
- Yeah, negative world.

168
00:02:49,693 --> 00:02:49,708
&nbsp

169
00:02:49,718 --> 00:02:51,559
Really? They have
Super Mario on Earth-29?

170
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:51,584
&nbsp

171
00:02:51,594 --> 00:02:53,168
Oh, yeah, challenge me.

172
00:02:53,178 --> 00:02:53,193
&nbsp

173
00:02:53,203 --> 00:02:55,449
Barry, you need my help.
Your shoulder is still broken.

174
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:55,474
&nbsp

175
00:02:55,484 --> 00:02:57,238
It's okay. It's almost healed.

176
00:02:57,248 --> 00:02:57,240
&nbsp

177
00:02:57,250 --> 00:02:58,560
No, look, I can do this.

178
00:02:58,570 --> 00:02:58,592
&nbsp

179
00:02:58,602 --> 00:03:00,959
I know, but I need you to stay here.

180
00:03:00,969 --> 00:03:00,961
&nbsp

181
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:03,212
Keep the city safe while I'm gone.

182
00:03:03,222 --> 00:03:03,214
&nbsp

183
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:06,256
And this is something I
have to do alone, okay?

184
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:07,849
&nbsp

185
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:08,942
Fine.

186
00:03:08,952 --> 00:03:08,967
&nbsp

187
00:03:08,977 --> 00:03:10,362
Thank you.

188
00:03:10,372 --> 00:03:13,765
&nbsp

189
00:03:13,775 --> 00:03:16,729
Okay, let's go to work.

190
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:16,871
&nbsp

191
00:03:16,881 --> 00:03:18,534
Can I talk to you?

192
00:03:18,544 --> 00:03:18,914
&nbsp

193
00:03:18,924 --> 00:03:20,413
Yeah.

194
00:03:20,423 --> 00:03:22,507
&nbsp

195
00:03:22,517 --> 00:03:24,448
I'm gonna find Wally.

196
00:03:24,458 --> 00:03:24,735
&nbsp

197
00:03:24,745 --> 00:03:26,706
Whatever's holding him,

198
00:03:26,716 --> 00:03:26,731
&nbsp

199
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:28,472
whatever's keeping him trapped in there,

200
00:03:28,482 --> 00:03:28,497
&nbsp

201
00:03:28,507 --> 00:03:30,155
I'm gonna get him back.

202
00:03:30,165 --> 00:03:32,013
&nbsp

203
00:03:32,023 --> 00:03:34,003
- Okay.
- Okay.

204
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:38,999
&nbsp

205
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:40,749
Iris...

206
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:41,919
&nbsp

207
00:03:41,929 --> 00:03:43,589
did I lose you?

208
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:54,160
&nbsp

209
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,576
Bar.

210
00:03:55,586 --> 00:03:57,953
&nbsp

211
00:03:57,963 --> 00:03:59,184
What's going on?

212
00:03:59,194 --> 00:03:59,186
&nbsp

213
00:03:59,196 --> 00:04:00,758
Nothing, nothing.

214
00:04:00,768 --> 00:04:00,783
&nbsp

215
00:04:00,793 --> 00:04:03,297
I'm just trying to make her...

216
00:04:03,307 --> 00:04:03,441
&nbsp

217
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,107
not worry so much.

218
00:04:05,117 --> 00:04:05,109
&nbsp

219
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:08,375
About Wally or you?

220
00:04:08,385 --> 00:04:08,400
&nbsp

221
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,461
Joe, now's not the time, all right?

222
00:04:10,471 --> 00:04:10,486
&nbsp

223
00:04:10,496 --> 00:04:12,242
Look, you...

224
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:12,502
&nbsp

225
00:04:12,512 --> 00:04:14,469
are about to risk your life

226
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:14,494
&nbsp

227
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,595
to save her brother.

228
00:04:16,605 --> 00:04:16,620
&nbsp

229
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:20,122
I think now is the perfect time.

230
00:04:20,132 --> 00:04:21,625
&nbsp

231
00:04:21,635 --> 00:04:23,765
She's having doubts about us.

232
00:04:23,775 --> 00:04:24,667
&nbsp

233
00:04:24,677 --> 00:04:26,326
About marrying me.

234
00:04:26,336 --> 00:04:26,351
&nbsp

235
00:04:26,361 --> 00:04:28,805
Did she call off the engagement?

236
00:04:28,815 --> 00:04:29,216
&nbsp

237
00:04:29,226 --> 00:04:31,967
Guess I changed the
future one too many times.

238
00:04:31,977 --> 00:04:35,473
&nbsp

239
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,230
I think that's gonna do it.

240
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:37,255
&nbsp

241
00:04:37,265 --> 00:04:39,672
We should be able to use this
to keep track of Barry's vitals.

242
00:04:39,682 --> 00:04:39,697
&nbsp

243
00:04:39,707 --> 00:04:41,551
He'll play astronaut,
and we'll play Houston.

244
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:41,576
&nbsp

245
00:04:41,586 --> 00:04:43,770
Right, but how exactly are
you gonna track his location

246
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:43,795
&nbsp

247
00:04:43,805 --> 00:04:45,211
when he's in the Speed Force?

248
00:04:45,221 --> 00:04:45,236
&nbsp

249
00:04:45,246 --> 00:04:47,103
Well, this is just a simple modification

250
00:04:47,113 --> 00:04:47,128
&nbsp

251
00:04:47,138 --> 00:04:48,878
from what we used to
get Barry out last time,

252
00:04:48,888 --> 00:04:48,903
&nbsp

253
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:51,534
so the electrode halo?

254
00:04:51,544 --> 00:04:51,559
&nbsp

255
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:52,905
Julian wasn't part
of the team last time.

256
00:04:52,915 --> 00:04:52,907
&nbsp

257
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,317
- Not yet.
- Oh, right.

258
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:54,342
&nbsp

259
00:04:54,352 --> 00:04:55,842
You know that thing we
used to talk to Savitar?

260
00:04:55,852 --> 00:04:55,867
&nbsp

261
00:04:55,877 --> 00:04:57,356
Yes.

262
00:04:57,366 --> 00:04:57,885
&nbsp

263
00:04:57,895 --> 00:04:59,638
Meet the electrode halo.

264
00:04:59,648 --> 00:04:59,640
&nbsp

265
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,308
So basically these two are
linked electromagnetically

266
00:05:02,318 --> 00:05:02,333
&nbsp

267
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,716
- via Goldtooth.
- Goldtooth?

268
00:05:04,726 --> 00:05:04,718
&nbsp

269
00:05:04,728 --> 00:05:07,085
Yeah, it's kind of the Cisco Ramon

270
00:05:07,095 --> 00:05:07,110
&nbsp

271
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,997
inter-dimensional
equivalent of Bluetooth.

272
00:05:09,007 --> 00:05:08,999
&nbsp

273
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,029
Kind of proud of it.

274
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:10,054
&nbsp

275
00:05:10,064 --> 00:05:12,459
Anyway, it gives us all the
relevant locus information

276
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:12,484
&nbsp

277
00:05:12,494 --> 00:05:14,537
no matter what corner of the
multiverse Barry's stuck in.

278
00:05:14,547 --> 00:05:14,562
&nbsp

279
00:05:14,572 --> 00:05:15,848
And, if Barry needs our help,

280
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:15,873
&nbsp

281
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:17,481
it'll stimulate Cisco's
prefrontal cortex.

282
00:05:17,491 --> 00:05:17,506
&nbsp

283
00:05:17,516 --> 00:05:18,514
And I'll open a breach and...

284
00:05:18,524 --> 00:05:18,516
&nbsp

285
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:19,738
send him back in.

286
00:05:19,748 --> 00:05:19,763
&nbsp

287
00:05:19,773 --> 00:05:22,631
Good Lord, multiverses, breaches, halos,

288
00:05:22,641 --> 00:05:22,770
&nbsp

289
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,636
easy bloody peasy.

290
00:05:24,646 --> 00:05:24,661
&nbsp

291
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:26,855
By George, I think he's got it.

292
00:05:26,865 --> 00:05:26,857
&nbsp

293
00:05:26,867 --> 00:05:28,707
Cisco, you about ready?

294
00:05:28,717 --> 00:05:28,732
&nbsp

295
00:05:28,742 --> 00:05:30,182
Born ready.

296
00:05:30,192 --> 00:05:33,658
&nbsp

297
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:35,293
Okay.

298
00:05:35,303 --> 00:05:35,318
&nbsp

299
00:05:35,328 --> 00:05:37,183
Here's winging it.

300
00:05:37,193 --> 00:05:37,418
&nbsp

301
00:05:37,428 --> 00:05:39,084
Winging it? Wait, what do you mean?

302
00:05:39,094 --> 00:05:39,086
&nbsp

303
00:05:39,096 --> 00:05:41,510
Well, I mean, I don't really
have a map of the Speed Force,

304
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:41,535
&nbsp

305
00:05:41,545 --> 00:05:43,121
so when I vibe Barry into it...

306
00:05:43,131 --> 00:05:43,123
&nbsp

307
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:44,506
You have no idea where I'm gonna land.

308
00:05:44,516 --> 00:05:44,531
&nbsp

309
00:05:44,541 --> 00:05:46,101
But the good news is, if he gets stuck

310
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,126
&nbsp

311
00:05:46,136 --> 00:05:48,710
on the wrong side of the
tracks, now we can fish him out.

312
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:55,678
&nbsp

313
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,504
Find my boy.

314
00:05:57,514 --> 00:05:57,575
&nbsp

315
00:05:57,585 --> 00:05:59,665
I'm gonna do whatever it takes.

316
00:05:59,675 --> 00:06:06,276
&nbsp

317
00:06:06,286 --> 00:06:07,977
Thank you.

318
00:06:07,987 --> 00:06:08,227
&nbsp

319
00:06:08,237 --> 00:06:09,893
I love you, Iris.

320
00:06:09,903 --> 00:06:12,971
&nbsp

321
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:14,507
I love you too.

322
00:06:14,517 --> 00:06:22,541
&nbsp

323
00:06:22,551 --> 00:06:23,824
Are we ready?

324
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:23,849
&nbsp

325
00:06:23,859 --> 00:06:25,315
Good to go.

326
00:06:25,325 --> 00:06:31,005
&nbsp

327
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:34,444
To infinity... and beyond.

328
00:06:34,454 --> 00:06:38,979
&nbsp

329
00:06:38,989 --> 00:06:42,647
Okay, once I let go, you're on your own.

330
00:06:42,657 --> 00:06:43,702
&nbsp

331
00:06:43,712 --> 00:06:45,265
Do it.

332
00:06:45,275 --> 00:06:47,865
&nbsp

333
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,584
Good luck.

334
00:06:49,594 --> 00:07:16,703
&nbsp

335
00:07:16,713 --> 00:07:18,162
Wally?

336
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:38,901
&nbsp

337
00:07:38,911 --> 00:07:40,673
Wally?

338
00:07:40,683 --> 00:08:06,023
&nbsp

339
00:08:06,033 --> 00:08:07,404
Hello?

340
00:08:07,414 --> 00:08:14,984
&nbsp

341
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,241
Hey, Bar.

342
00:08:16,251 --> 00:08:31,706
&nbsp

343
00:08:31,716 --> 00:08:33,372
Why are you here?

344
00:08:33,382 --> 00:08:33,397
&nbsp

345
00:08:33,407 --> 00:08:35,752
Why did you come back to this place?

346
00:08:35,762 --> 00:08:36,267
&nbsp

347
00:08:36,277 --> 00:08:38,433
I'm here to save Wally West.

348
00:08:38,443 --> 00:08:38,435
&nbsp

349
00:08:38,445 --> 00:08:40,652
Ever the hero, huh, Barry?

350
00:08:40,662 --> 00:08:40,654
&nbsp

351
00:08:40,664 --> 00:08:43,061
It's my fault that he's trapped here.

352
00:08:43,071 --> 00:08:43,086
&nbsp

353
00:08:43,096 --> 00:08:44,538
Is it?

354
00:08:44,548 --> 00:08:44,754
&nbsp

355
00:08:44,764 --> 00:08:47,171
Where is Wally West?

356
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:47,897
&nbsp

357
00:08:47,907 --> 00:08:50,481
He's not exactly here, per se.

358
00:08:50,491 --> 00:08:50,664
&nbsp

359
00:08:50,674 --> 00:08:52,854
He's in the prison you created.

360
00:08:52,864 --> 00:08:52,879
&nbsp

361
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:56,297
Well, your future self, that is.

362
00:08:56,307 --> 00:08:56,322
&nbsp

363
00:08:56,332 --> 00:08:58,289
How do I get him out?

364
00:08:58,299 --> 00:08:58,422
&nbsp

365
00:08:58,432 --> 00:08:59,955
How do I get him out?

366
00:08:59,965 --> 00:08:59,957
&nbsp

367
00:08:59,967 --> 00:09:01,268
I think you'll find we're not gonna be

368
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:01,293
&nbsp

369
00:09:01,303 --> 00:09:04,069
as accommodating as we were
the last time you visited us.

370
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:04,094
&nbsp

371
00:09:04,104 --> 00:09:05,677
What the hell does that mean?

372
00:09:05,687 --> 00:09:05,679
&nbsp

373
00:09:05,689 --> 00:09:07,963
It means things have changed.

374
00:09:07,973 --> 00:09:07,988
&nbsp

375
00:09:07,998 --> 00:09:10,192
We gave you your speed
back because you said

376
00:09:10,202 --> 00:09:10,217
&nbsp

377
00:09:10,227 --> 00:09:12,850
you'd come to terms
with your mother's death,

378
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,354
&nbsp

379
00:09:13,364 --> 00:09:14,853
but you lied to us.

380
00:09:14,863 --> 00:09:14,855
&nbsp

381
00:09:14,865 --> 00:09:16,768
- I...
- You went back in time,

382
00:09:16,778 --> 00:09:16,793
&nbsp

383
00:09:16,803 --> 00:09:18,210
and saved her.

384
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:18,235
&nbsp

385
00:09:18,245 --> 00:09:20,451
And, in doing so, you
created Flashpoint.

386
00:09:20,461 --> 00:09:20,527
&nbsp

387
00:09:20,537 --> 00:09:22,694
Zoom had just killed my father.

388
00:09:22,704 --> 00:09:22,696
&nbsp

389
00:09:22,706 --> 00:09:26,096
We know, and we understand,

390
00:09:26,106 --> 00:09:26,130
&nbsp

391
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,430
which is why we allowed you to do that,

392
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:28,535
&nbsp

393
00:09:28,545 --> 00:09:30,736
but choices have consequences.

394
00:09:30,746 --> 00:09:30,738
&nbsp

395
00:09:30,748 --> 00:09:34,149
And I'm afraid we can't let you
make any more choices like that.

396
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:34,174
&nbsp

397
00:09:34,184 --> 00:09:35,823
Wally is just a kid.

398
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:35,826
&nbsp

399
00:09:35,836 --> 00:09:37,626
He's a Flash.

400
00:09:37,636 --> 00:09:37,628
&nbsp

401
00:09:37,638 --> 00:09:39,048
He made his choice.

402
00:09:39,058 --> 00:09:39,073
&nbsp

403
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,938
Now he has to live with it,

404
00:09:40,948 --> 00:09:41,467
&nbsp

405
00:09:41,477 --> 00:09:42,996
just like you do.

406
00:09:43,006 --> 00:09:44,323
&nbsp

407
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,241
I'm not going anywhere
until Wally's free.

408
00:09:47,251 --> 00:09:47,266
&nbsp

409
00:09:47,276 --> 00:09:50,100
Then be prepared to
spend an eternity in here.

410
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:53,093
&nbsp

411
00:09:53,103 --> 00:09:54,676
Why would you order a single espresso?

412
00:09:54,686 --> 00:09:54,678
&nbsp

413
00:09:54,688 --> 00:09:55,927
It's gotta be at least
a double espresso.

414
00:09:55,937 --> 00:09:55,929
&nbsp

415
00:09:55,939 --> 00:09:57,346
I can go triple.

416
00:09:57,356 --> 00:09:57,348
&nbsp

417
00:09:57,358 --> 00:09:58,930
- Doesn't affect me at all.
- Frightening.

418
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:58,932
&nbsp

419
00:09:58,942 --> 00:10:01,166
I can have a quadruple, a sextuple.

420
00:10:01,176 --> 00:10:01,191
&nbsp

421
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:02,974
Oh, there you are. I'm
gonna get us all coffees

422
00:10:02,984 --> 00:10:02,999
&nbsp

423
00:10:03,009 --> 00:10:04,753
'cause we got a lot of
work to do, you know?

424
00:10:04,763 --> 00:10:04,778
&nbsp

425
00:10:04,788 --> 00:10:06,228
A lot of... a lot of stuff to do.

426
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:06,253
&nbsp

427
00:10:06,263 --> 00:10:08,914
It doesn't affect me though.
It doesn't affect me at all!

428
00:10:08,924 --> 00:10:08,939
&nbsp

429
00:10:08,949 --> 00:10:10,392
Okay.

430
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:10,861
&nbsp

431
00:10:10,871 --> 00:10:13,197
- He scares me.
- Yeah.

432
00:10:13,207 --> 00:10:13,768
&nbsp

433
00:10:13,778 --> 00:10:16,802
I was wondering, do you
think you could use this

434
00:10:16,812 --> 00:10:16,827
&nbsp

435
00:10:16,837 --> 00:10:19,361
to track Savitar's location?

436
00:10:19,371 --> 00:10:20,120
&nbsp

437
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:21,586
That's not a bad idea.

438
00:10:21,596 --> 00:10:21,588
&nbsp

439
00:10:21,598 --> 00:10:23,867
You know, I couldn't before
because he was in the Speed Force,

440
00:10:23,877 --> 00:10:23,892
&nbsp

441
00:10:23,902 --> 00:10:25,374
but, now that he's out of it,

442
00:10:25,384 --> 00:10:25,376
&nbsp

443
00:10:25,386 --> 00:10:28,562
feeling footloose and
fancy-free, I'm sure...

444
00:10:28,572 --> 00:10:28,587
&nbsp

445
00:10:28,597 --> 00:10:30,835
I'm sorry, you know what?
That was insensitive of me.

446
00:10:30,845 --> 00:10:30,860
&nbsp

447
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,954
- It's fine.
- Okay, so...

448
00:10:32,964 --> 00:10:33,495
&nbsp

449
00:10:33,505 --> 00:10:36,635
let's say I find Savitar, right now.

450
00:10:36,645 --> 00:10:36,637
&nbsp

451
00:10:36,647 --> 00:10:38,509
What are you gonna do about it?

452
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:39,723
&nbsp

453
00:10:39,733 --> 00:10:41,501
I'm gonna go after him.

454
00:10:41,511 --> 00:10:41,892
&nbsp

455
00:10:41,902 --> 00:10:44,726
Jesse, are you out of your mind?

456
00:10:44,736 --> 00:10:44,728
&nbsp

457
00:10:44,738 --> 00:10:47,229
No, okay? I can't just sit here waiting.

458
00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:47,231
&nbsp

459
00:10:47,241 --> 00:10:48,730
You can, and you will.

460
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:48,732
&nbsp

461
00:10:48,742 --> 00:10:50,095
We all will. And, soon enough,

462
00:10:50,105 --> 00:10:50,120
&nbsp

463
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,037
Barry's gonna get Wally
out of the Speed Force.

464
00:10:52,047 --> 00:10:52,069
&nbsp

465
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:53,788
You don't know that, okay?

466
00:10:53,798 --> 00:10:53,813
&nbsp

467
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,153
We don't know anything.

468
00:10:55,163 --> 00:10:55,155
&nbsp

469
00:10:55,165 --> 00:10:57,375
The only thing we actually know
is that Savitar is out there,

470
00:10:57,385 --> 00:10:57,400
&nbsp

471
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,458
and, if we can, we have to find him

472
00:10:59,468 --> 00:10:59,460
&nbsp

473
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,977
and send him right
back where he came from.

474
00:11:01,987 --> 00:11:02,830
&nbsp

475
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,493
You're staying here.

476
00:11:04,503 --> 00:11:12,648
&nbsp

477
00:11:12,658 --> 00:11:14,449
_

478
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:14,475
&nbsp

479
00:11:14,485 --> 00:11:16,141
Iris.

480
00:11:16,151 --> 00:11:20,097
&nbsp

481
00:11:20,107 --> 00:11:22,167
I wrote that article.

482
00:11:22,177 --> 00:11:23,100
&nbsp

483
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:25,667
That used to be my byline, but...

484
00:11:25,677 --> 00:11:26,224
&nbsp

485
00:11:26,234 --> 00:11:27,713
not anymore.

486
00:11:27,723 --> 00:11:30,240
&nbsp

487
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:35,308
Well, 2024 is a long ways away.

488
00:11:35,318 --> 00:11:36,864
&nbsp

489
00:11:36,874 --> 00:11:38,780
Things could still change.

490
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:41,656
&nbsp

491
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,803
What if it's too late?

492
00:11:43,813 --> 00:11:44,538
&nbsp

493
00:11:44,548 --> 00:11:46,770
What if some things can't be undone?

494
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:51,323
&nbsp

495
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:53,373
You having second thoughts?

496
00:11:53,383 --> 00:11:54,515
&nbsp

497
00:11:54,525 --> 00:11:57,146
I guess I'm just worried that...

498
00:11:57,156 --> 00:11:58,086
&nbsp

499
00:11:58,096 --> 00:12:00,365
I made the wrong decision.

500
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:01,248
&nbsp

501
00:12:01,258 --> 00:12:02,804
And what?

502
00:12:02,814 --> 00:12:02,806
&nbsp

503
00:12:02,816 --> 00:12:06,473
You think that calling things off...

504
00:12:06,483 --> 00:12:06,498
&nbsp

505
00:12:06,508 --> 00:12:09,406
sent Barry running into the Speed Force?

506
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:09,443
&nbsp

507
00:12:09,453 --> 00:12:11,860
Please, we both know

508
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:11,885
&nbsp

509
00:12:11,895 --> 00:12:14,552
that he was gonna go
save Wally no matter what.

510
00:12:14,562 --> 00:12:15,068
&nbsp

511
00:12:15,078 --> 00:12:19,007
Yeah, that's just the
kind of hero he is.

512
00:12:19,017 --> 00:12:21,325
&nbsp

513
00:12:21,335 --> 00:12:24,929
Sweetheart, I know... I
know how you're feeling.

514
00:12:24,939 --> 00:12:27,414
&nbsp

515
00:12:27,424 --> 00:12:30,568
You can't figure out which
way's up right now, can you?

516
00:12:30,578 --> 00:12:33,003
&nbsp

517
00:12:33,013 --> 00:12:34,966
Do yourself a favor.

518
00:12:34,976 --> 00:12:35,305
&nbsp

519
00:12:35,315 --> 00:12:39,912
Look deep inside that big,
beautiful heart of yours.

520
00:12:39,922 --> 00:12:41,228
&nbsp

521
00:12:41,238 --> 00:12:43,371
You'll find the answer
you're looking for.

522
00:12:43,381 --> 00:12:51,855
&nbsp

523
00:12:51,865 --> 00:12:55,216
Eddie Thawne's life
was almost so different.

524
00:12:55,226 --> 00:12:57,828
&nbsp

525
00:12:57,838 --> 00:13:00,497
Iris was about to be his wife.

526
00:13:00,507 --> 00:13:01,054
&nbsp

527
00:13:01,064 --> 00:13:03,817
Joe was about to be his father-in-law.

528
00:13:03,827 --> 00:13:03,842
&nbsp

529
00:13:03,852 --> 00:13:07,473
But things didn't turn out
that way, did they, Barry?

530
00:13:07,483 --> 00:13:14,009
&nbsp

531
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:16,843
Instead of that life being his legacy...

532
00:13:16,853 --> 00:13:19,986
&nbsp

533
00:13:19,996 --> 00:13:21,918
this is.

534
00:13:21,928 --> 00:13:29,359
&nbsp

535
00:13:29,369 --> 00:13:33,552
So the only reason you
came back is to save Wally.

536
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:34,147
&nbsp

537
00:13:34,157 --> 00:13:35,841
Yes.

538
00:13:35,851 --> 00:13:36,200
&nbsp

539
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,138
There's no other reason?

540
00:13:38,148 --> 00:13:39,514
&nbsp

541
00:13:39,524 --> 00:13:40,817
No.

542
00:13:40,827 --> 00:13:41,371
&nbsp

543
00:13:41,381 --> 00:13:42,904
All right then, Bar.

544
00:13:42,914 --> 00:13:42,906
&nbsp

545
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:45,040
If you want Wally, all you need to do

546
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:45,042
&nbsp

547
00:13:45,052 --> 00:13:46,850
is go through those doors.

548
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,796
&nbsp

549
00:13:49,806 --> 00:13:52,930
But you're gonna have to
outrun that thing first.

550
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,918
&nbsp

551
00:13:54,928 --> 00:13:56,501
Time Wraith.

&nbsp

573
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:24,196
Hello, Barry.

574
00:15:24,206 --> 00:15:24,465
&nbsp

575
00:15:24,475 --> 00:15:26,131
We need to talk.

576
00:15:26,141 --> 00:15:27,968
&nbsp

577
00:15:27,978 --> 00:15:32,504
Perhaps some sort of new metal
akin to a Luttinger liquid?

578
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:32,506
&nbsp

579
00:15:32,516 --> 00:15:33,839
What do you think?

580
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:33,841
&nbsp

581
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:36,174
Man, I don't know what this is.

582
00:15:36,184 --> 00:15:36,176
&nbsp

583
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:37,918
All I know, it just came off the armor

584
00:15:37,928 --> 00:15:37,943
&nbsp

585
00:15:37,953 --> 00:15:39,928
of some Hindu speed god, so...

586
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:39,930
&nbsp

587
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,831
It's like the box the
philosopher's stone came in.

588
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:41,856
&nbsp

589
00:15:41,866 --> 00:15:44,401
It simultaneously
exists and doesn't exist.

590
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:44,426
&nbsp

591
00:15:44,436 --> 00:15:47,236
Like Schroeder's cat.
Remember Schroeder?

592
00:15:47,246 --> 00:15:47,238
&nbsp

593
00:15:47,248 --> 00:15:49,571
Guy with the cat in the
box both dead and alive

594
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:49,573
&nbsp

595
00:15:49,583 --> 00:15:51,523
at the same time, dun,
dun, dun, which, by the way,

596
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:51,525
&nbsp

597
00:15:51,535 --> 00:15:54,359
seems like cruelty for
animals half the time.

598
00:15:54,369 --> 00:15:54,361
&nbsp

599
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:58,030
Okay, I think you're thinking
of Schrodinger, maybe?

600
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,032
&nbsp

601
00:15:58,042 --> 00:16:00,115
- Schroding... no.
- Yeah, 'cause Schroeder's

602
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:00,117
&nbsp

603
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:01,783
the guys from "Peanuts."

604
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:01,785
&nbsp

605
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:04,119
- I don't think so.
- Yeah, the one with the piano.

606
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:04,121
&nbsp

607
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:05,394
- Yeah.
- The...

608
00:16:05,404 --> 00:16:05,396
&nbsp

609
00:16:05,406 --> 00:16:08,350
Charlie Brown has the piano on my Earth.

610
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:08,375
&nbsp

611
00:16:08,385 --> 00:16:10,375
That's the whole gag 'cause
he can't play the piano.

612
00:16:10,385 --> 00:16:10,377
&nbsp

613
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:11,503
- He's terrible.
- No.

614
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:11,528
&nbsp

615
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:15,107
Oh, my God, who cares
about cats or pianos

616
00:16:15,117 --> 00:16:15,132
&nbsp

617
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:17,432
- or the freaking "Peanuts"?
- It's not "The Peanuts."

618
00:16:17,442 --> 00:16:17,434
&nbsp

619
00:16:17,444 --> 00:16:19,101
It's just "Peanuts."

620
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:19,103
&nbsp

621
00:16:19,113 --> 00:16:21,053
You have been studying
this thing for hours.

622
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:21,055
&nbsp

623
00:16:21,065 --> 00:16:23,472
Can we or can we not
use it to track Savitar?

624
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:23,474
&nbsp

625
00:16:23,484 --> 00:16:25,941
Okay, all right, wind it in.

626
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:26,026
&nbsp

627
00:16:26,036 --> 00:16:29,230
As far as we can tell, the shard is
made of near-frictionless material

628
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:29,255
&nbsp

629
00:16:29,265 --> 00:16:31,003
that's in a constant state of flux.

630
00:16:31,013 --> 00:16:31,028
&nbsp

631
00:16:31,038 --> 00:16:32,895
So while it's utterly
motionless on the outside...

632
00:16:32,905 --> 00:16:32,920
&nbsp

633
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:35,630
It's constantly moving on the inside.

634
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:35,655
&nbsp

635
00:16:35,665 --> 00:16:39,204
Yes, it's as if it's being affected
by some sort of external source,

636
00:16:39,214 --> 00:16:39,206
&nbsp

637
00:16:39,216 --> 00:16:42,491
much like the tides are affected
by the phases of the moon.

638
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:42,493
&nbsp

639
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:45,627
Okay, okay, then it has to be Savitar.

640
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:45,629
&nbsp

641
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:47,320
I mean, this was part of his armor.

642
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:47,345
&nbsp

643
00:16:47,355 --> 00:16:49,846
Maybe it's trying to reconnect
with its other pieces.

644
00:16:49,856 --> 00:16:49,871
&nbsp

645
00:16:49,881 --> 00:16:51,083
That's it.

646
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:51,085
&nbsp

647
00:16:51,095 --> 00:16:53,218
It's just like "The Iron Giant."

648
00:16:53,228 --> 00:16:53,220
&nbsp

649
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:57,089
If this is true, then this
shard could lead us right to him.

650
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:57,091
&nbsp

651
00:16:57,101 --> 00:16:58,590
That's an idea.

652
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:58,592
&nbsp

653
00:16:58,602 --> 00:17:00,475
Okay, all right, so
what are we waiting for?

654
00:17:00,485 --> 00:17:00,477
&nbsp

655
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:01,842
Let's...

656
00:17:01,852 --> 00:17:02,262
&nbsp

657
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:05,180
Hold your roll, Jesse Quick.

658
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:05,182
&nbsp

659
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:08,433
This hesitation that you
feel, on behalf of the group,

660
00:17:08,443 --> 00:17:08,435
&nbsp

661
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:11,603
is our realization that
this "go for broke" attitude

662
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:11,605
&nbsp

663
00:17:11,615 --> 00:17:14,439
is the very attitude that
got Wallace in his predicament

664
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:14,441
&nbsp

665
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:15,991
in the first place. Am I right?

666
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:15,993
&nbsp

667
00:17:16,003 --> 00:17:17,409
I can't believe I'm uttering the words,

668
00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:17,411
&nbsp

669
00:17:17,421 --> 00:17:21,025
but I actually agree with H.R.

670
00:17:21,035 --> 00:17:21,050
&nbsp

671
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,206
- Ditto.
- Thanks, boys.

672
00:17:22,216 --> 00:17:22,231
&nbsp

673
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:23,749
A lone speedster...

674
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:23,751
&nbsp

675
00:17:23,761 --> 00:17:25,752
it's just no match for Savitar.

676
00:17:25,762 --> 00:17:25,777
&nbsp

677
00:17:25,787 --> 00:17:28,430
- Yeah, but...
- Jesse, we're gonna find him.

678
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:28,455
&nbsp

679
00:17:28,465 --> 00:17:29,454
When?

680
00:17:29,464 --> 00:17:29,456
&nbsp

681
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:31,617
When the real Flash gets back.

682
00:17:31,627 --> 00:17:32,209
&nbsp

683
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:35,210
That came out wrong, um...

684
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:35,212
&nbsp

685
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:36,428
Wow.

686
00:17:36,438 --> 00:17:38,048
&nbsp

687
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:39,931
Put my foot in it.

688
00:17:39,941 --> 00:17:41,018
&nbsp

689
00:17:41,028 --> 00:17:43,338
Jesse, Jesse!

690
00:17:43,348 --> 00:17:43,369
&nbsp

691
00:17:43,379 --> 00:17:46,415
Oh, Jesse, hey, Jesse, quick question:

692
00:17:46,425 --> 00:17:46,440
&nbsp

693
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,440
Merlot or Cabernet?

694
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:48,775
&nbsp

695
00:17:48,785 --> 00:17:49,975
What?

696
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:49,977
&nbsp

697
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:51,979
What wine do you think would go best

698
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:52,004
&nbsp

699
00:17:52,014 --> 00:17:55,480
with a big, old men's size
11 shoe stuffed in his mouth?

700
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:55,482
&nbsp

701
00:17:55,492 --> 00:17:56,982
- H.R.?
- Yeah?

702
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:56,984
&nbsp

703
00:17:56,994 --> 00:17:59,451
- Just leave me alone.
- I get it, I get it.

704
00:17:59,461 --> 00:17:59,453
&nbsp

705
00:17:59,463 --> 00:18:01,120
I get... Savitar...

706
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:01,145
&nbsp

707
00:18:01,155 --> 00:18:02,736
Savitar hurt the one you love,

708
00:18:02,746 --> 00:18:02,761
&nbsp

709
00:18:02,771 --> 00:18:04,374
now you wanna hurt Savitar.

710
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:04,375
&nbsp

711
00:18:04,385 --> 00:18:05,651
Yeah, bet your ass, I do.

712
00:18:05,661 --> 00:18:05,676
&nbsp

713
00:18:05,686 --> 00:18:07,259
No, I get it. I... I love it.

714
00:18:07,269 --> 00:18:07,284
&nbsp

715
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:09,918
I respect it. I'm a
little worried though

716
00:18:09,928 --> 00:18:10,047
&nbsp

717
00:18:10,057 --> 00:18:12,497
that, in your zeal for
payback, you might be the one

718
00:18:12,507 --> 00:18:12,499
&nbsp

719
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:13,915
who ends up getting hurt.

720
00:18:13,925 --> 00:18:13,917
&nbsp

721
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,333
- On my Earth...
- Yeah.

722
00:18:15,343 --> 00:18:15,335
&nbsp

723
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:17,636
- I am the real Flash.
- I know.

724
00:18:17,646 --> 00:18:17,638
&nbsp

725
00:18:17,648 --> 00:18:19,004
That's why I...

726
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:19,006
&nbsp

727
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:20,389
I should've said what I said.

728
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:20,391
&nbsp

729
00:18:20,401 --> 00:18:21,948
No, no, you shouldn't have, okay?

730
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:21,973
&nbsp

731
00:18:21,983 --> 00:18:24,403
'Cause I've fought
plenty of monsters before.

732
00:18:24,413 --> 00:18:24,428
&nbsp

733
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:26,015
Yeah, absolutely.

734
00:18:26,025 --> 00:18:26,040
&nbsp

735
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,312
Like Savitar, though?

736
00:18:27,322 --> 00:18:27,314
&nbsp

737
00:18:27,324 --> 00:18:29,481
'Cause, look, here's the thing.

738
00:18:29,491 --> 00:18:29,483
&nbsp

739
00:18:29,493 --> 00:18:31,703
If your father were here, he would...

740
00:18:31,713 --> 00:18:31,728
&nbsp

741
00:18:31,738 --> 00:18:34,603
He would do everything in
his power to stop Savitar.

742
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:34,605
&nbsp

743
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:37,109
And that is exactly what I'm gonna do.

744
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:39,018
&nbsp

745
00:18:39,028 --> 00:18:41,125
Okay, okay.

746
00:18:41,135 --> 00:18:41,150
&nbsp

747
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,407
I mean, hats off to you.

748
00:18:42,417 --> 00:18:42,432
&nbsp

749
00:18:42,442 --> 00:18:44,727
You really are Hard-Hat
Harry's little girl, aren't you?

750
00:18:44,737 --> 00:18:44,752
&nbsp

751
00:18:44,762 --> 00:18:46,664
Yeah, I am, and you're not him.

752
00:18:46,674 --> 00:18:46,950
&nbsp

753
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,452
So just do us both a favor
and stop trying to be.

754
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:53,707
&nbsp

755
00:18:53,717 --> 00:18:55,757
This troubles you.

756
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:55,759
&nbsp

757
00:18:55,769 --> 00:18:59,551
Another life that could've
been and never was.

758
00:18:59,561 --> 00:19:02,382
&nbsp

759
00:19:02,392 --> 00:19:05,240
Caitlin and Ronnie should've had that.

760
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,470
&nbsp

761
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,688
A family, a future.

762
00:19:09,698 --> 00:19:09,690
&nbsp

763
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,390
The future doesn't always
turn out as we want it to.

764
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,021
&nbsp

765
00:19:15,031 --> 00:19:17,246
I see what you're doing.

766
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:17,314
&nbsp

767
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:20,363
First Eddie, now Ronnie,

768
00:19:20,373 --> 00:19:20,410
&nbsp

769
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,783
showing me all of the people

770
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:21,785
&nbsp

771
00:19:21,795 --> 00:19:23,902
who sacrificed themselves
for the greater good.

772
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:23,904
&nbsp

773
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:26,705
No, Barry, their
sacrifices were for you,

774
00:19:26,715 --> 00:19:26,707
&nbsp

775
00:19:26,717 --> 00:19:29,645
as was Wally's when he
attempted to stop Savitar.

776
00:19:29,655 --> 00:19:29,670
&nbsp

777
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,410
No, Savitar tricked Wally.

778
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:32,412
&nbsp

779
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:33,879
And now he's trapped.

780
00:19:33,889 --> 00:19:33,881
&nbsp

781
00:19:33,891 --> 00:19:35,664
Wally doesn't belong in the Speed Force.

782
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:35,666
&nbsp

783
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:38,162
You have to let me take his place.

784
00:19:38,172 --> 00:19:40,387
&nbsp

785
00:19:40,397 --> 00:19:41,503
And that's why I'm here.

786
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:41,505
&nbsp

787
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:44,064
Or the other reason, Barry.

788
00:19:44,074 --> 00:19:44,900
&nbsp

789
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,809
I wanna sacrifice myself for Wally.

790
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:47,811
&nbsp

791
00:19:47,821 --> 00:19:50,312
- We can't allow that.
- Why not?

792
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:50,337
&nbsp

793
00:19:50,347 --> 00:19:53,665
Because where Wally's
gone is a hell all his own.

794
00:19:53,675 --> 00:19:53,924
&nbsp

795
00:19:53,934 --> 00:19:57,435
Savitar said, "One will suffer
a fate far worse than death."

796
00:19:57,445 --> 00:19:57,437
&nbsp

797
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:59,212
And it's not for you.

798
00:19:59,222 --> 00:19:59,237
&nbsp

799
00:19:59,247 --> 00:20:01,853
Leave, Barry, while you still can.

800
00:20:01,863 --> 00:20:03,327
&nbsp

801
00:20:03,337 --> 00:20:04,696
No.

802
00:20:04,706 --> 00:20:11,722
&nbsp

803
00:20:11,732 --> 00:20:15,168
Whatever hell Wally's trapped
in, I'm gonna set him free,

804
00:20:15,178 --> 00:20:15,193
&nbsp

805
00:20:15,203 --> 00:20:17,582
and I'm not leaving here until I do.

806
00:20:17,592 --> 00:20:18,425
&nbsp

807
00:20:18,435 --> 00:20:21,941
Very well, but you were warned.

808
00:20:21,951 --> 00:20:28,909
&nbsp

809
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:30,558
Hunter Zolomon.

810
00:20:30,568 --> 00:20:42,983
&nbsp

811
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:44,906
Come on, come on.

812
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:53,414
&nbsp

813
00:20:53,424 --> 00:20:55,256
- Is it Barry?
- Did something happen to him?

814
00:20:55,266 --> 00:20:55,281
&nbsp

815
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,711
We don't know. One second, the
telemetry was perfectly normal, and...

816
00:20:57,721 --> 00:20:57,736
&nbsp

817
00:20:57,746 --> 00:21:00,195
Then his vitals, they
just started crashing.

818
00:21:00,205 --> 00:21:00,460
&nbsp

819
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,109
We warned you.

820
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:02,134
&nbsp

821
00:21:02,144 --> 00:21:04,253
Why are you doing this?

822
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:04,922
&nbsp

823
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:07,505
You speak of sacrifice,
yet you still let others

824
00:21:07,515 --> 00:21:07,507
&nbsp

825
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:10,091
bear the burdens that
should be on your shoulders.

826
00:21:10,101 --> 00:21:11,833
&nbsp

827
00:21:11,843 --> 00:21:14,584
Okay, okay, you're right.

828
00:21:14,594 --> 00:21:14,609
&nbsp

829
00:21:14,619 --> 00:21:16,142
You're right.

830
00:21:16,152 --> 00:21:16,167
&nbsp

831
00:21:16,177 --> 00:21:18,634
I never should've asked
Wally to save Iris.

832
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:18,652
&nbsp

833
00:21:18,662 --> 00:21:20,542
It should've been me.

834
00:21:20,552 --> 00:21:22,606
&nbsp

835
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:25,650
Please, let me save him.

836
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:25,675
&nbsp

837
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:27,359
There's only one way to free Wally West

838
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:27,361
&nbsp

839
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:29,449
from his eternal torment.

840
00:21:29,459 --> 00:21:29,529
&nbsp

841
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:32,631
You must free yourself first.

842
00:21:32,641 --> 00:21:49,800
&nbsp

843
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,753
I love you, Iris.

844
00:21:51,763 --> 00:21:54,972
&nbsp

845
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:56,214
No.

846
00:21:56,224 --> 00:21:56,974
&nbsp

847
00:21:56,984 --> 00:21:59,140
- Cisco, is he...
- I don't know, I don't know.

848
00:21:59,150 --> 00:21:59,142
&nbsp

849
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:00,604
Find out!

850
00:22:00,614 --> 00:22:00,967
&nbsp

851
00:22:00,977 --> 00:22:02,503
I can't.

852
00:22:02,513 --> 00:22:03,897
&nbsp

853
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:05,814
- The tether's gone.
- What?

854
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:05,816
&nbsp

855
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:08,066
That was him and Wally's
lifeline out of the Speed Force.

856
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:08,068
&nbsp

857
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:09,818
How are we gonna get them back?

858
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:09,820
&nbsp

859
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,870
I don't know that we can.

860
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:38,515
&nbsp

861
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:40,476
Hello?

862
00:22:40,486 --> 00:22:48,992
&nbsp

863
00:22:49,002 --> 00:22:50,868
Wally?

864
00:22:50,878 --> 00:23:01,030
&nbsp

865
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,947
Wally, Wally!

866
00:23:03,957 --> 00:23:06,293
&nbsp

867
00:23:06,303 --> 00:23:07,459
I'm gonna get you out, okay?

868
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:07,461
&nbsp

869
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:08,927
Just hang on.

870
00:23:08,937 --> 00:23:10,047
&nbsp

871
00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:13,024
Visiting hours are over, Flash.

872
00:23:13,034 --> 00:23:22,859
&nbsp

873
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:24,567
So...

874
00:23:24,577 --> 00:23:25,288
&nbsp

875
00:23:25,298 --> 00:23:27,206
that's not yours.

876
00:23:27,216 --> 00:23:27,981
&nbsp

877
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:30,282
- Get out of my way.
- I can't do that.

878
00:23:30,292 --> 00:23:30,307
&nbsp

879
00:23:30,317 --> 00:23:33,545
Not if you're planning on using
that to fight Savitar. I can't.

880
00:23:33,555 --> 00:23:33,570
&nbsp

881
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,120
You're not gonna talk
me out of this, okay?

882
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:35,122
&nbsp

883
00:23:35,132 --> 00:23:37,180
- I already told you you're not...
- ... Not your dad.

884
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:37,205
&nbsp

885
00:23:37,215 --> 00:23:40,086
That message was
received loud and clear.

886
00:23:40,096 --> 00:23:40,111
&nbsp

887
00:23:40,121 --> 00:23:41,293
Now hear mine.

888
00:23:41,303 --> 00:23:41,295
&nbsp

889
00:23:41,305 --> 00:23:43,912
Taking on Savitar all alone

890
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:43,914
&nbsp

891
00:23:43,924 --> 00:23:46,595
is not gonna bring Wallace back, Jesse.

892
00:23:46,605 --> 00:23:46,620
&nbsp

893
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:49,301
It's just gonna get
you killed, and that,

894
00:23:49,311 --> 00:23:49,303
&nbsp

895
00:23:49,313 --> 00:23:52,589
my friend, that is not happening.

896
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:52,756
&nbsp

897
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:54,682
Not on my watch.

898
00:23:54,692 --> 00:23:55,559
&nbsp

899
00:23:55,569 --> 00:23:56,699
You done?

900
00:23:56,709 --> 00:23:56,724
&nbsp

901
00:23:56,734 --> 00:23:58,893
Yeah, said my piece.

902
00:23:58,903 --> 00:23:58,895
&nbsp

903
00:23:58,905 --> 00:23:59,978
And guess what?

904
00:23:59,988 --> 00:23:59,980
&nbsp

905
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,763
I'm still not...

906
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,100
&nbsp

907
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,597
moving...

908
00:24:04,607 --> 00:24:10,440
&nbsp

909
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,440
That was oddly satisfying.

910
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:15,529
&nbsp

911
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:17,329
What's happening to him?

912
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:17,331
&nbsp

913
00:24:17,341 --> 00:24:20,829
Wally West is caught in
an endless temporal loop,

914
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:20,868
&nbsp

915
00:24:20,878 --> 00:24:25,036
just like Savitar after you
imprisoned him here in the future.

916
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:25,038
&nbsp

917
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:27,548
No wonder he hates you.

918
00:24:27,558 --> 00:24:30,952
&nbsp

919
00:24:30,962 --> 00:24:32,961
What's he seeing?

920
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:32,963
&nbsp

921
00:24:32,973 --> 00:24:37,015
He's reliving the single most
painful moment of his life...

922
00:24:37,025 --> 00:24:37,017
&nbsp

923
00:24:37,027 --> 00:24:40,397
over and over again.

924
00:24:40,407 --> 00:24:40,721
&nbsp

925
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:43,115
His mother's death.

926
00:24:43,125 --> 00:24:43,473
&nbsp

927
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:44,959
Wally.

928
00:24:44,969 --> 00:24:46,643
&nbsp

929
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:48,276
He doesn't deserve this.

930
00:24:48,286 --> 00:24:48,278
&nbsp

931
00:24:48,288 --> 00:24:50,537
Let me guess. You do?

932
00:24:50,547 --> 00:24:52,593
&nbsp

933
00:24:52,603 --> 00:24:54,699
I know what my hell is.

934
00:24:54,709 --> 00:24:54,701
&nbsp

935
00:24:54,711 --> 00:24:57,327
I've already seen it in the future.

936
00:24:57,337 --> 00:24:57,352
&nbsp

937
00:24:57,362 --> 00:24:59,102
You don't like the future, Flash?

938
00:24:59,112 --> 00:24:59,104
&nbsp

939
00:24:59,114 --> 00:25:00,904
- Change it.
- I can't.

940
00:25:00,914 --> 00:25:00,906
&nbsp

941
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,105
Don't you get it? I can't!

942
00:25:02,115 --> 00:25:02,107
&nbsp

943
00:25:02,117 --> 00:25:04,073
I'm not fast enough. He is.

944
00:25:04,083 --> 00:25:08,061
&nbsp

945
00:25:08,071 --> 00:25:10,947
That's why you have to
let me take his place.

946
00:25:10,957 --> 00:25:13,168
&nbsp

947
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,690
Wally can save Iris.

948
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:15,715
&nbsp

949
00:25:15,725 --> 00:25:17,598
Not learning your lesson, Barry.

950
00:25:17,608 --> 00:25:17,623
&nbsp

951
00:25:17,633 --> 00:25:20,958
You keep telling us one
thing and then doing another.

952
00:25:20,968 --> 00:25:23,178
&nbsp

953
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,428
You wanna know what
inspired Leonard Snart

954
00:25:25,438 --> 00:25:25,430
&nbsp

955
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,380
to sacrifice himself?

956
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:27,382
&nbsp

957
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:30,440
It was you, Barry Allen.

958
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:30,465
&nbsp

959
00:25:30,475 --> 00:25:34,246
You inspired him to be better.

960
00:25:34,256 --> 00:25:34,272
&nbsp

961
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:36,163
You inspired him to be selfless,

962
00:25:36,173 --> 00:25:36,188
&nbsp

963
00:25:36,198 --> 00:25:38,858
to sacrifice himself for others,

964
00:25:38,868 --> 00:25:38,883
&nbsp

965
00:25:38,893 --> 00:25:40,757
to be a hero,

966
00:25:40,767 --> 00:25:40,782
&nbsp

967
00:25:40,792 --> 00:25:43,030
just like you.

968
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,292
&nbsp

969
00:25:43,302 --> 00:25:45,022
I'm no hero.

970
00:25:45,032 --> 00:25:45,321
&nbsp

971
00:25:45,331 --> 00:25:46,927
Not lately.

972
00:25:46,937 --> 00:25:46,952
&nbsp

973
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,893
So what?

974
00:25:48,903 --> 00:25:49,120
&nbsp

975
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:52,010
You've had enough, Scarlet Speedster?

976
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:52,324
&nbsp

977
00:25:52,334 --> 00:25:55,408
Time to hang up the
cowl and give it all up?

978
00:25:55,418 --> 00:25:55,410
&nbsp

979
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,245
Well, if you're out...

980
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:58,997
&nbsp

981
00:25:59,007 --> 00:26:00,580
you're out.

982
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:00,582
&nbsp

983
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:01,965
I'm done fighting.

984
00:26:01,975 --> 00:26:01,967
&nbsp

985
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,467
We know, and that's exactly the problem.

986
00:26:04,477 --> 00:26:09,257
&nbsp

987
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:11,877
You think seeing Iris' death is hell?

988
00:26:11,887 --> 00:26:11,902
&nbsp

989
00:26:11,912 --> 00:26:14,602
You ain't seen nothing yet.

990
00:26:14,612 --> 00:26:19,100
&nbsp

991
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,683
Let's get you out of here.

992
00:26:20,693 --> 00:26:31,605
&nbsp

993
00:26:31,615 --> 00:26:33,997
Okay, you stupid piece of metal,

994
00:26:34,007 --> 00:26:34,950
&nbsp

995
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,271
take me to your leader.

996
00:26:37,281 --> 00:26:45,710
&nbsp

997
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,078
Gotcha.

998
00:26:47,088 --> 00:27:04,091
&nbsp

999
00:27:04,101 --> 00:27:06,007
Jesse Quick.

1000
00:27:06,017 --> 00:27:06,197
&nbsp

1001
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:09,198
I knew you would come for me.

1002
00:27:09,208 --> 00:27:16,129
&nbsp

1003
00:27:16,139 --> 00:27:17,545
How'd you know I was coming here?

1004
00:27:17,555 --> 00:27:17,547
&nbsp

1005
00:27:17,557 --> 00:27:20,406
Because I know everything that happens.

1006
00:27:20,416 --> 00:27:20,431
&nbsp

1007
00:27:20,441 --> 00:27:22,094
I've already lived it.

1008
00:27:22,104 --> 00:27:22,119
&nbsp

1009
00:27:22,129 --> 00:27:25,064
- I'm not afraid of you.
- You should be.

1010
00:27:25,074 --> 00:27:36,050
&nbsp

1011
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,799
Jesse.

1012
00:27:37,809 --> 00:27:37,801
&nbsp

1013
00:27:37,811 --> 00:27:39,057
H.R.?

1014
00:27:39,067 --> 00:27:39,082
&nbsp

1015
00:27:39,092 --> 00:27:41,219
It's a little late to
talk me out of this, okay?

1016
00:27:41,229 --> 00:27:41,221
&nbsp

1017
00:27:41,231 --> 00:27:43,604
I'm not gonna try and talk you out
of anything. I learned that lesson.

1018
00:27:43,614 --> 00:27:43,629
&nbsp

1019
00:27:43,639 --> 00:27:46,752
You have something that belongs to me.

1020
00:27:46,762 --> 00:27:51,807
&nbsp

1021
00:27:51,817 --> 00:27:53,482
I need a little help here, H.R.

1022
00:27:53,492 --> 00:27:53,484
&nbsp

1023
00:27:53,494 --> 00:27:55,448
- Bum, bum, thinking.
- Think faster.

1024
00:27:55,458 --> 00:27:55,473
&nbsp

1025
00:27:55,483 --> 00:27:56,877
What do we got? We're fighting Savitar.

1026
00:27:56,887 --> 00:27:56,902
&nbsp

1027
00:27:56,912 --> 00:27:59,076
Savitar is a speed god. He's omnipotent.

1028
00:27:59,086 --> 00:27:59,101
&nbsp

1029
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:00,384
He's invulnerable.

1030
00:28:00,394 --> 00:28:00,409
&nbsp

1031
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:02,688
Then why does he need a suit of armor?

1032
00:28:02,698 --> 00:28:02,690
&nbsp

1033
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,792
Jesse, he's vulnerable
somewhere under the suit.

1034
00:28:04,802 --> 00:28:04,817
&nbsp

1035
00:28:04,827 --> 00:28:06,956
Find a gap, find an
opening, and go for it.

1036
00:28:06,966 --> 00:28:08,309
&nbsp

1037
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:12,441
I have such plans for you
in the future, Jesse Quick.

1038
00:28:12,451 --> 00:28:12,466
&nbsp

1039
00:28:12,476 --> 00:28:14,550
And I have plans for you too.

1040
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:14,575
&nbsp

1041
00:28:14,585 --> 00:28:16,074
This is for Wally.

1042
00:28:16,084 --> 00:28:16,099
&nbsp

1043
00:28:16,109 --> 00:28:17,515
Ahh!

1044
00:28:17,525 --> 00:28:17,540
&nbsp

1045
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,974
Yeah!

1046
00:28:18,984 --> 00:28:32,305
&nbsp

1047
00:28:32,315 --> 00:28:33,450
Jay.

1048
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:33,475
&nbsp

1049
00:28:33,485 --> 00:28:34,633
Yeah?

1050
00:28:34,643 --> 00:28:34,658
&nbsp

1051
00:28:34,668 --> 00:28:37,071
Is this really you,

1052
00:28:37,081 --> 00:28:37,096
&nbsp

1053
00:28:37,106 --> 00:28:38,845
or is this...

1054
00:28:38,855 --> 00:28:38,884
&nbsp

1055
00:28:38,894 --> 00:28:41,235
just another Speed Force test?

1056
00:28:41,245 --> 00:28:41,436
&nbsp

1057
00:28:41,446 --> 00:28:44,522
Yeah, kid, it's really me.

1058
00:28:44,532 --> 00:28:45,483
&nbsp

1059
00:28:45,493 --> 00:28:46,918
How?

1060
00:28:46,928 --> 00:28:46,943
&nbsp

1061
00:28:46,953 --> 00:28:48,564
As soon as the team
lost contact with you,

1062
00:28:48,574 --> 00:28:48,589
&nbsp

1063
00:28:48,599 --> 00:28:51,210
Cisco came to my Earth and
told me what was happening.

1064
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:51,235
&nbsp

1065
00:28:51,245 --> 00:28:52,768
I came here to help.

1066
00:28:52,778 --> 00:28:53,093
&nbsp

1067
00:28:53,103 --> 00:28:54,889
Let's get Wally.

1068
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,024
&nbsp

1069
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:58,023
'Fraid I can't let you do that.

1070
00:28:58,033 --> 00:28:58,048
&nbsp

1071
00:28:58,058 --> 00:29:01,266
Getting a little slow in your
golden age there, Garrick.

1072
00:29:01,276 --> 00:29:01,268
&nbsp

1073
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:03,301
- Stop.
- Can't do that either.

1074
00:29:03,311 --> 00:29:16,387
&nbsp

1075
00:29:16,397 --> 00:29:17,983
Enough!

1076
00:29:17,993 --> 00:29:17,985
&nbsp

1077
00:29:17,995 --> 00:29:19,234
I'm taking Wally.

1078
00:29:19,244 --> 00:29:19,236
&nbsp

1079
00:29:19,246 --> 00:29:21,513
We can't let you do that, Barry.

1080
00:29:21,523 --> 00:29:21,738
&nbsp

1081
00:29:21,748 --> 00:29:24,193
Yeah? Try and stop me.

1082
00:29:24,203 --> 00:29:32,992
&nbsp

1083
00:29:33,002 --> 00:29:34,332
Wally?

1084
00:29:34,342 --> 00:29:37,462
&nbsp

1085
00:29:37,472 --> 00:29:40,539
Hey, Wally.

1086
00:29:40,549 --> 00:29:43,323
&nbsp

1087
00:29:43,333 --> 00:29:44,851
Hey.

1088
00:29:44,861 --> 00:29:45,212
&nbsp

1089
00:29:45,222 --> 00:29:48,253
Barry, Jay.

1090
00:29:48,263 --> 00:29:49,900
&nbsp

1091
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:51,940
- I saw my mom.
- I know,

1092
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:52,050
&nbsp

1093
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,435
- I know.
- My mom.

1094
00:29:53,445 --> 00:29:53,437
&nbsp

1095
00:29:53,447 --> 00:29:55,745
I know. Look at me now, okay?

1096
00:29:55,755 --> 00:29:55,844
&nbsp

1097
00:29:55,854 --> 00:29:57,378
It's over.

1098
00:29:57,388 --> 00:29:58,001
&nbsp

1099
00:29:58,011 --> 00:30:00,385
You're free now, okay?

1100
00:30:00,395 --> 00:30:00,410
&nbsp

1101
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:02,489
We're going home, all right?

1102
00:30:02,499 --> 00:30:02,514
&nbsp

1103
00:30:02,524 --> 00:30:04,021
It's okay.

1104
00:30:04,031 --> 00:30:04,046
&nbsp

1105
00:30:04,056 --> 00:30:05,833
We're going home.

1106
00:30:05,843 --> 00:30:09,675
&nbsp

1107
00:30:09,685 --> 00:30:12,357
Jay, let's go.

1108
00:30:12,367 --> 00:30:13,744
&nbsp

1109
00:30:13,754 --> 00:30:15,536
Sorry, kid,

1110
00:30:15,546 --> 00:30:16,249
&nbsp

1111
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:18,685
this is where I stay for a while.

1112
00:30:18,695 --> 00:30:20,214
&nbsp

1113
00:30:20,224 --> 00:30:23,014
What? What are you talking about?

1114
00:30:23,024 --> 00:30:23,039
&nbsp

1115
00:30:23,049 --> 00:30:25,078
We both know that a speedster

1116
00:30:25,088 --> 00:30:25,103
&nbsp

1117
00:30:25,113 --> 00:30:27,750
needs to take Wally's place.

1118
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,304
&nbsp

1119
00:30:28,314 --> 00:30:29,804
That's why I'm here.

1120
00:30:29,814 --> 00:30:29,806
&nbsp

1121
00:30:29,816 --> 00:30:33,195
No, no, Jay, you already lived your hell

1122
00:30:33,205 --> 00:30:33,220
&nbsp

1123
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,343
when you were Zoom's prisoner.

1124
00:30:34,353 --> 00:30:34,368
&nbsp

1125
00:30:34,378 --> 00:30:36,838
And you set me free,
and I owe you for that.

1126
00:30:36,848 --> 00:30:36,863
&nbsp

1127
00:30:36,873 --> 00:30:39,570
- Jay...
- I've run a hell of a race,

1128
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,581
&nbsp

1129
00:30:40,591 --> 00:30:43,421
but every marathon has a finish line.

1130
00:30:43,431 --> 00:30:43,635
&nbsp

1131
00:30:43,645 --> 00:30:47,171
Time's finally come for
me to cross it, but you...

1132
00:30:47,181 --> 00:30:47,973
&nbsp

1133
00:30:47,983 --> 00:30:49,814
you, Barry,

1134
00:30:49,824 --> 00:30:50,369
&nbsp

1135
00:30:50,379 --> 00:30:52,361
need to put an end to
this once and for all

1136
00:30:52,371 --> 00:30:52,386
&nbsp

1137
00:30:52,396 --> 00:30:54,697
and stop Savitar.

1138
00:30:54,707 --> 00:30:57,290
&nbsp

1139
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,689
How?

1140
00:30:58,699 --> 00:31:01,495
&nbsp

1141
00:31:01,505 --> 00:31:03,732
Do what you do best.

1142
00:31:03,742 --> 00:31:04,997
&nbsp

1143
00:31:05,007 --> 00:31:06,974
Be The Flash.

1144
00:31:06,984 --> 00:31:10,550
&nbsp

1145
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:14,591
Cisco said that he could
use this to track you...

1146
00:31:14,601 --> 00:31:15,202
&nbsp

1147
00:31:15,212 --> 00:31:17,235
and bring you home.

1148
00:31:17,245 --> 00:31:23,850
&nbsp

1149
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,317
I'm gonna get this back to you again,

1150
00:31:26,327 --> 00:31:26,342
&nbsp

1151
00:31:26,352 --> 00:31:28,548
when I break you out of here.

1152
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:29,992
&nbsp

1153
00:31:30,002 --> 00:31:32,297
See you soon, Flash.

1154
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:52,701
&nbsp

1155
00:31:52,711 --> 00:31:54,412
What's happening?

1156
00:31:54,422 --> 00:31:54,437
&nbsp

1157
00:31:54,447 --> 00:31:56,020
Do you think you can reel them in?

1158
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:56,045
&nbsp

1159
00:31:56,055 --> 00:31:57,506
I don't know.

1160
00:31:57,516 --> 00:31:57,531
&nbsp

1161
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,498
I've never felt this
much harmonic feedback.

1162
00:31:59,508 --> 00:31:59,523
&nbsp

1163
00:31:59,533 --> 00:32:01,646
It feels like the Speed
Force is about to...

1164
00:32:01,656 --> 00:32:03,412
&nbsp

1165
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:05,458
- Wally!
- Barry!

1166
00:32:05,468 --> 00:32:06,078
&nbsp

1167
00:32:06,088 --> 00:32:07,576
Oh, my God.

1168
00:32:07,586 --> 00:32:09,208
&nbsp

1169
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,488
Are you okay?

1170
00:32:10,498 --> 00:32:10,490
&nbsp

1171
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,873
We will be.

1172
00:32:11,883 --> 00:32:14,320
&nbsp

1173
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:16,237
Hold on a second.

1174
00:32:16,247 --> 00:32:16,413
&nbsp

1175
00:32:16,423 --> 00:32:19,693
Three speedsters go in,
and only two come out.

1176
00:32:19,703 --> 00:32:19,718
&nbsp

1177
00:32:19,728 --> 00:32:21,482
Jay...

1178
00:32:21,492 --> 00:32:22,859
&nbsp

1179
00:32:22,869 --> 00:32:26,505
Jay stayed back...

1180
00:32:26,515 --> 00:32:26,726
&nbsp

1181
00:32:26,736 --> 00:32:28,441
to save Wally.

1182
00:32:28,451 --> 00:32:33,550
&nbsp

1183
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:36,168
Come on, Wally, let's
get you checked out.

1184
00:32:36,178 --> 00:32:40,220
&nbsp

1185
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:42,220
I thought I lost both my boys.

1186
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:42,245
&nbsp

1187
00:32:42,255 --> 00:32:44,739
- Thanks for bringing him back.
- You're welcome.

1188
00:32:44,749 --> 00:32:46,289
&nbsp

1189
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:47,559
Thank you.

1190
00:32:47,569 --> 00:32:52,024
&nbsp

1191
00:32:52,034 --> 00:32:54,199
I thought I'd lost you too.

1192
00:32:54,209 --> 00:32:56,189
&nbsp

1193
00:32:56,199 --> 00:32:57,869
I'm right here.

1194
00:32:57,879 --> 00:33:10,893
&nbsp

1195
00:33:10,903 --> 00:33:13,060
The Speed Force.

1196
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:13,062
&nbsp

1197
00:33:13,072 --> 00:33:16,280
And it just appeared to you
in the form of Eddie Thawne?

1198
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:16,282
&nbsp

1199
00:33:16,292 --> 00:33:18,983
- And Ronnie?
- And Snart.

1200
00:33:18,993 --> 00:33:18,985
&nbsp

1201
00:33:18,995 --> 00:33:20,701
All to teach me another lesson.

1202
00:33:20,711 --> 00:33:20,703
&nbsp

1203
00:33:20,713 --> 00:33:22,384
Which was what?

1204
00:33:22,394 --> 00:33:22,788
&nbsp

1205
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:26,079
Saving Iris is my
responsibility and mine alone.

1206
00:33:26,089 --> 00:33:26,104
&nbsp

1207
00:33:26,114 --> 00:33:28,625
It's why the Speed Force didn't
let me take Wally's place,

1208
00:33:28,635 --> 00:33:28,627
&nbsp

1209
00:33:28,637 --> 00:33:32,212
why Jay sacrificed himself to do it.

1210
00:33:32,222 --> 00:33:32,214
&nbsp

1211
00:33:32,224 --> 00:33:34,134
So I could finish this.

1212
00:33:34,144 --> 00:33:34,258
&nbsp

1213
00:33:34,268 --> 00:33:35,914
Jay,

1214
00:33:35,924 --> 00:33:36,836
&nbsp

1215
00:33:36,846 --> 00:33:38,789
hero among heroes.

1216
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:38,814
&nbsp

1217
00:33:38,824 --> 00:33:40,170
Yeah.

1218
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:40,172
&nbsp

1219
00:33:40,182 --> 00:33:42,139
We can't just leave him in there.

1220
00:33:42,149 --> 00:33:42,141
&nbsp

1221
00:33:42,151 --> 00:33:43,511
We won't.

1222
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:43,536
&nbsp

1223
00:33:43,546 --> 00:33:46,037
I'll beat Savitar. We'll get him out.

1224
00:33:46,047 --> 00:33:46,095
&nbsp

1225
00:33:46,105 --> 00:33:47,895
Good, 'cause it seems
to me the Speed Force

1226
00:33:47,905 --> 00:33:47,897
&nbsp

1227
00:33:47,907 --> 00:33:49,346
is a little bit of a crazy place.

1228
00:33:49,356 --> 00:33:49,348
&nbsp

1229
00:33:49,358 --> 00:33:51,160
Just ask Wallace.

1230
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:51,434
&nbsp

1231
00:33:51,444 --> 00:33:54,051
Yeah, yeah, what...

1232
00:33:54,061 --> 00:33:54,076
&nbsp

1233
00:33:54,086 --> 00:33:56,097
what Wally saw...

1234
00:33:56,107 --> 00:33:56,439
&nbsp

1235
00:33:56,449 --> 00:33:58,272
it's gonna haunt him for a while.

1236
00:33:58,282 --> 00:33:58,274
&nbsp

1237
00:33:58,284 --> 00:34:01,025
So until he can get past
it, and he's really ready

1238
00:34:01,035 --> 00:34:01,027
&nbsp

1239
00:34:01,037 --> 00:34:04,100
to go back out there, Kid Flash is...

1240
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:04,125
&nbsp

1241
00:34:04,135 --> 00:34:06,458
gonna need to take a break for a while.

1242
00:34:06,468 --> 00:34:09,476
&nbsp

1243
00:34:09,486 --> 00:34:10,978
Hey.

1244
00:34:10,988 --> 00:34:11,587
&nbsp

1245
00:34:11,597 --> 00:34:12,997
You okay?

1246
00:34:13,007 --> 00:34:14,373
&nbsp

1247
00:34:14,383 --> 00:34:15,935
Are you?

1248
00:34:15,945 --> 00:34:16,675
&nbsp

1249
00:34:16,685 --> 00:34:18,060
Right.

1250
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:18,507
&nbsp

1251
00:34:18,517 --> 00:34:20,771
You should see the other guy.

1252
00:34:20,781 --> 00:34:21,192
&nbsp

1253
00:34:21,202 --> 00:34:22,880
Caitlin said I'll be fine.

1254
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:22,882
&nbsp

1255
00:34:22,892 --> 00:34:26,133
Jesse, I can't believe you
went after Savitar by yourself.

1256
00:34:26,143 --> 00:34:26,158
&nbsp

1257
00:34:26,168 --> 00:34:28,169
What were you thinking?

1258
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:28,998
&nbsp

1259
00:34:29,008 --> 00:34:31,888
The same thing you were when you did it.

1260
00:34:31,898 --> 00:34:31,913
&nbsp

1261
00:34:31,923 --> 00:34:34,005
Yeah, that was a mistake.

1262
00:34:34,015 --> 00:34:35,111
&nbsp

1263
00:34:35,121 --> 00:34:37,644
One that I will never make again.

1264
00:34:37,654 --> 00:34:37,646
&nbsp

1265
00:34:37,656 --> 00:34:40,649
Yeah, yeah, me either.

1266
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:42,201
&nbsp

1267
00:34:42,211 --> 00:34:44,892
Not on this Earth, anyway.

1268
00:34:44,902 --> 00:34:46,887
&nbsp

1269
00:34:46,897 --> 00:34:51,291
Wait, what? You're going
back to Earth-2 already?

1270
00:34:51,301 --> 00:34:51,293
&nbsp

1271
00:34:51,303 --> 00:34:54,578
- Earth-3, actually.
- But you just got here, Jesse.

1272
00:34:54,588 --> 00:34:54,580
&nbsp

1273
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:58,192
I know, I know, and
I want to be with you.

1274
00:34:58,202 --> 00:34:59,247
&nbsp

1275
00:34:59,257 --> 00:35:03,762
It's just Savitar said he had
plans for me in the future.

1276
00:35:03,772 --> 00:35:04,173
&nbsp

1277
00:35:04,183 --> 00:35:06,622
I can't let that happen.

1278
00:35:06,632 --> 00:35:08,184
&nbsp

1279
00:35:08,194 --> 00:35:11,178
Besides, until Barry can get
Jay out of the Speed Force,

1280
00:35:11,188 --> 00:35:11,180
&nbsp

1281
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:13,847
Earth-3 needs a Flash to protect it.

1282
00:35:13,857 --> 00:35:18,187
&nbsp

1283
00:35:18,197 --> 00:35:20,376
I love you, Jesse.

1284
00:35:20,386 --> 00:35:24,994
&nbsp

1285
00:35:25,004 --> 00:35:26,910
I love you too.

1286
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:35,704
&nbsp

1287
00:35:35,714 --> 00:35:37,475
You show those villains on Earth-3.

1288
00:35:37,485 --> 00:35:37,500
&nbsp

1289
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,289
Nobody messes with our Jesse Quick.

1290
00:35:39,299 --> 00:35:39,291
&nbsp

1291
00:35:39,301 --> 00:35:41,578
- That's right. You give them hell.
- You know I will.

1292
00:35:41,588 --> 00:35:41,603
&nbsp

1293
00:35:41,613 --> 00:35:43,594
We're here if you need us, all right?

1294
00:35:43,604 --> 00:35:43,596
&nbsp

1295
00:35:43,606 --> 00:35:45,848
- Safe travels.
- Thanks.

1296
00:35:45,858 --> 00:35:48,300
&nbsp

1297
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:50,968
Sorry for the, uh...

1298
00:35:50,978 --> 00:35:50,970
&nbsp

1299
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,193
Yeah, yeah, me too.

1300
00:35:53,203 --> 00:35:53,218
&nbsp

1301
00:35:53,228 --> 00:35:55,692
- Good left-hook.
- Thanks.

1302
00:35:55,702 --> 00:35:55,717
&nbsp

1303
00:35:55,727 --> 00:35:58,218
I shouldn't be surprised. Us Wellses...

1304
00:35:58,228 --> 00:35:58,444
&nbsp

1305
00:35:58,454 --> 00:36:00,694
we are forces to be reckoned with.

1306
00:36:00,704 --> 00:36:00,696
&nbsp

1307
00:36:00,706 --> 00:36:02,747
That we are.

1308
00:36:02,757 --> 00:36:03,532
&nbsp

1309
00:36:03,542 --> 00:36:05,790
Thank you, H.R.

1310
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:05,951
&nbsp

1311
00:36:05,961 --> 00:36:07,568
For what?

1312
00:36:07,578 --> 00:36:07,570
&nbsp

1313
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,403
Just being a friend.

1314
00:36:09,413 --> 00:36:15,377
&nbsp

1315
00:36:15,387 --> 00:36:17,078
Thank you.

1316
00:36:17,088 --> 00:36:17,711
&nbsp

1317
00:36:17,721 --> 00:36:19,079
Yeah.

1318
00:36:19,089 --> 00:36:22,585
&nbsp

1319
00:36:22,595 --> 00:36:24,551
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1320
00:36:24,561 --> 00:36:28,140
&nbsp

1321
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:30,232
This isn't good-bye.

1322
00:36:30,242 --> 00:36:30,309
&nbsp

1323
00:36:30,319 --> 00:36:33,091
No, it's more like "see you later."

1324
00:36:33,101 --> 00:36:33,979
&nbsp

1325
00:36:33,989 --> 00:36:35,596
I can't wait.

1326
00:36:35,606 --> 00:36:55,784
&nbsp

1327
00:36:55,794 --> 00:36:59,146
So, fun fact...

1328
00:36:59,156 --> 00:36:59,265
&nbsp

1329
00:36:59,275 --> 00:37:01,922
uncovered by our intrepid Jesse Quick,

1330
00:37:01,932 --> 00:37:01,924
&nbsp

1331
00:37:01,934 --> 00:37:06,552
in her latest dust-up with
the so-called "God of Speed,"

1332
00:37:06,562 --> 00:37:06,577
&nbsp

1333
00:37:06,587 --> 00:37:09,213
guess who feels pain.

1334
00:37:09,223 --> 00:37:09,215
&nbsp

1335
00:37:09,225 --> 00:37:11,044
What... what exactly are you saying?

1336
00:37:11,054 --> 00:37:11,069
&nbsp

1337
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:13,350
Are you saying that underneath
the suit of armor that's he's...

1338
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:13,352
&nbsp

1339
00:37:13,362 --> 00:37:16,833
Yes, James. He's not a god.

1340
00:37:16,843 --> 00:37:16,858
&nbsp

1341
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:20,226
He's just a man, baby.

1342
00:37:20,236 --> 00:37:20,251
&nbsp

1343
00:37:20,261 --> 00:37:22,161
- A man?
- Yeah.

1344
00:37:22,171 --> 00:37:38,297
&nbsp

1345
00:37:38,307 --> 00:37:39,409
Hey.

1346
00:37:39,419 --> 00:37:39,411
&nbsp

1347
00:37:39,421 --> 00:37:41,016
Hey.

1348
00:37:41,026 --> 00:37:44,500
&nbsp

1349
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,917
Thank you for saving Wally.

1350
00:37:46,927 --> 00:37:46,919
&nbsp

1351
00:37:46,929 --> 00:37:48,477
Of course.

1352
00:37:48,487 --> 00:37:49,338
&nbsp

1353
00:37:49,348 --> 00:37:50,555
Um,

1354
00:37:50,565 --> 00:37:52,010
&nbsp

1355
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,477
so, I just...

1356
00:37:55,487 --> 00:37:55,594
&nbsp

1357
00:37:55,604 --> 00:38:00,147
Look, you told me that you
only wanted to marry someone

1358
00:38:00,157 --> 00:38:00,149
&nbsp

1359
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:01,399
because they love you

1360
00:38:01,409 --> 00:38:01,424
&nbsp

1361
00:38:01,434 --> 00:38:03,594
and not because they
were trying to save you,

1362
00:38:03,604 --> 00:38:03,619
&nbsp

1363
00:38:03,629 --> 00:38:05,336
and I get that.

1364
00:38:05,346 --> 00:38:06,355
&nbsp

1365
00:38:06,365 --> 00:38:08,105
I just...

1366
00:38:08,115 --> 00:38:10,109
&nbsp

1367
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:13,963
you know, I've lived
with a lot of death,

1368
00:38:13,973 --> 00:38:13,988
&nbsp

1369
00:38:13,998 --> 00:38:15,696
tragedy in my life,

1370
00:38:15,706 --> 00:38:15,698
&nbsp

1371
00:38:15,708 --> 00:38:19,199
and seeing you die...

1372
00:38:19,209 --> 00:38:22,121
&nbsp

1373
00:38:22,131 --> 00:38:25,849
it's impossible not
to be consumed by that.

1374
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:27,287
&nbsp

1375
00:38:27,297 --> 00:38:29,632
Yeah, no, I get that.

1376
00:38:29,642 --> 00:38:29,657
&nbsp

1377
00:38:29,667 --> 00:38:31,240
I do.

1378
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:31,930
&nbsp

1379
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,803
It just...

1380
00:38:33,813 --> 00:38:34,550
&nbsp

1381
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,800
it made me question
if you were asking me

1382
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:36,802
&nbsp

1383
00:38:36,812 --> 00:38:39,436
for the right reasons, you know?

1384
00:38:39,446 --> 00:38:39,670
&nbsp

1385
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,645
If it was out of love or...

1386
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:44,054
&nbsp

1387
00:38:44,064 --> 00:38:46,170
responsibility.

1388
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,896
&nbsp

1389
00:38:47,906 --> 00:38:49,903
But, look,

1390
00:38:49,913 --> 00:38:49,928
&nbsp

1391
00:38:49,938 --> 00:38:52,731
while you were gone,
I realized something.

1392
00:38:52,741 --> 00:38:52,951
&nbsp

1393
00:38:52,961 --> 00:38:54,985
I don't have to doubt
why you wanna marry me.

1394
00:38:54,995 --> 00:38:54,987
&nbsp

1395
00:38:54,997 --> 00:38:57,661
It's the same reason
that I wanna marry you.

1396
00:38:57,671 --> 00:38:57,864
&nbsp

1397
00:38:57,874 --> 00:38:59,049
Mm-hmm.

1398
00:38:59,059 --> 00:38:59,153
&nbsp

1399
00:38:59,163 --> 00:39:01,434
I wanna be your wife, Barry.

1400
00:39:01,444 --> 00:39:10,394
&nbsp

1401
00:39:10,404 --> 00:39:12,066
Um...

1402
00:39:12,076 --> 00:39:15,591
&nbsp

1403
00:39:15,601 --> 00:39:17,074
I love you.

1404
00:39:17,084 --> 00:39:20,138
&nbsp

1405
00:39:20,148 --> 00:39:21,816
But,

1406
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:25,129
&nbsp

1407
00:39:25,139 --> 00:39:26,557
uh...

1408
00:39:26,567 --> 00:39:32,608
&nbsp

1409
00:39:32,618 --> 00:39:34,375
you were right.

1410
00:39:34,385 --> 00:39:36,226
&nbsp

1411
00:39:36,236 --> 00:39:39,929
I proposed...

1412
00:39:39,939 --> 00:39:41,036
&nbsp

1413
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:43,994
because I thought it would save you.

1414
00:39:44,004 --> 00:39:45,238
&nbsp

1415
00:39:45,248 --> 00:39:47,431
I thought Wally would save you.

1416
00:39:47,441 --> 00:39:47,456
&nbsp

1417
00:39:47,466 --> 00:39:49,134
I...

1418
00:39:49,144 --> 00:39:50,011
&nbsp

1419
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:51,845
I was wrong.

1420
00:39:51,855 --> 00:39:51,960
&nbsp

1421
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:55,429
I alone have to save you in
the future, and I'm going to,

1422
00:39:55,439 --> 00:39:55,431
&nbsp

1423
00:39:55,441 --> 00:39:57,850
but not by changing it.

1424
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:58,133
&nbsp

1425
00:39:58,143 --> 00:40:00,131
By embracing it.

1426
00:40:00,141 --> 00:40:01,951
&nbsp

1427
00:40:01,961 --> 00:40:04,248
Okay, um...

1428
00:40:04,258 --> 00:40:04,857
&nbsp

1429
00:40:04,867 --> 00:40:07,358
what... what does that mean?

1430
00:40:07,368 --> 00:40:09,846
&nbsp

1431
00:40:09,856 --> 00:40:12,003
It means that...

1432
00:40:12,013 --> 00:40:12,028
&nbsp

1433
00:40:12,038 --> 00:40:16,181
I-I think we need
some space for a while.

1434
00:40:16,191 --> 00:40:20,330
&nbsp

1435
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:23,583
I'm sorry, but I-I don't...
I don't know how we can...

1436
00:40:23,593 --> 00:40:23,625
&nbsp

1437
00:40:23,635 --> 00:40:26,165
move forward like this, with...

1438
00:40:26,175 --> 00:40:29,998
&nbsp

1439
00:40:30,008 --> 00:40:31,534
Um...

1440
00:40:31,544 --> 00:40:36,672
&nbsp

1441
00:40:36,682 --> 00:40:38,315
okay.

1442
00:40:38,325 --> 00:40:49,235
&nbsp

1443
00:40:49,245 --> 00:40:50,851
I guess I'll go to my dad's.

1444
00:40:50,861 --> 00:40:50,853
&nbsp

1445
00:40:50,863 --> 00:40:53,072
No, you stay here. I'll...

1446
00:40:53,082 --> 00:40:53,097
&nbsp

1447
00:40:53,107 --> 00:40:55,876
I'll stay with Cisco.

1448
