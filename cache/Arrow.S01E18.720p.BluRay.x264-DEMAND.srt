1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,242
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,605
For five years, I was stranded
on an island with only one goal:

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,166
- Survive.
- Oliver Queen is alive.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,806
Now I will fulfill
my father's dying wish...

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,201
...to use the list of names he left me...

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,045
...and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,642
To do this, I must become someone else.

8
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,047
I must become something else.

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,850
Previously on Arrow:

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,570
- Mom?
- What are you doing here?

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,003
- I believe Sara's still alive.
- You don't actually have any proof.

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,448
I have proof.
Doesn't it look just like Sara?

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,166
I did manage to find one thing.

14
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,526
I want to get out.

15
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,206
Malcolm Merlyn.
I want you to kill him for me.

16
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,610
If we have a traitor in our midst,
he just made his last mistake.

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,967
Lawyers for John Nickel
spoke to the press today.

18
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,562
They say they're pleased the DA declined
to indict their client on charges...

19
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,326
...stemming from the recent fire
in one of Nickel's buildings.

20
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,802
Nickel is one of the wealthiest
real estate developers in Starling City.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,445
He's also one of the dirtiest.

22
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,400
That building that burnt down last night,
the wiring was not up to code.

23
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,166
- Maybe he didn't know.
- He didn't know about the seven people...

24
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,891
...who have frozen to death
in his other buildings.

25
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,849
Yeah, he's a real man of the people.

26
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,880
Not for long.

27
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,731
The DA ignores this
and the police can't do anything...

28
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,281
...because all these
slums are in the Glades.

29
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,563
So tonight, Felicity,
we cross Mr. Nickel's name off the list.

30
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,047
You okay with that?

31
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,600
The scene outside of
the courtroom where Nickel was released...

32
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,041
- ...was, not surprisingly, tense.
- One hundred percent.

33
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,201
- He was just gone?
- No, not gone. Taken.

34
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,681
Looks like Nickel was on
somebody else's list.

35
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,525
After the fire last night,
it's not entirely surprising.

36
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,001
Felicity, get everything
that you can on Nickel.

37
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,210
Focus on his tenants, anyone who might have
filed a formal complaint against him...

38
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,007
- ...or people that lost something in the fire.
- It's gonna be some list.

39
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,409
Slumlords aren't generally known
for their popularity. Plus...

40
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,568
- What?
- Nothing. It's just...

41
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,207
You went over there to be all,
"Grr, stop being bad or I'll arrow you."

42
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,691
Now you want to rescue him?

43
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,287
I don't like the idea
that somebody dangerous is out there.

44
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,122
Somebody else.

45
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,964
Because typically...

46
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,724
...they don't show my level of restraint.

47
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,247
- So you're gonna cross Nickel off anyway?
- No.

48
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,767
I'm finding somebody else
who needs a talking-to.

49
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,924
You're going out there again, Oliver?

50
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,845
- Go be with your family.
- That's when the work is done.

51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,765
- Okay, I'll take you out to dinner.
- I'm not hungry.

52
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,365
I'm not asking.

53
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,204
Simple exchange.

54
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,364
You get us off the island,
we'll give you the circuit board...

55
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,887
...so your missile launcher
isn't just furniture.

56
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,203
You've grown up quite a bit, Mr. Queen.
I'll give you that.

57
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,171
I can get you a boat.

58
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,288
But I need time.

59
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,125
You got an hour,
Fyers, and then you're never...

60
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,881
What?

61
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,646
It might take you longer
than an hour to get a boat.

62
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,406
What we mean is you need
to move with some dispatch.

63
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,450
Oh, Wilson, still in command there, eh?

64
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,046
I thought your little pet
had staged a coup d'e'tat.

65
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,402
Just get us the damn boat.

66
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,528
I got a fatal heart

67
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,002
I'm tied to the living
Got a tortured soul

68
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,083
I can't give it away

69
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,244
Gonna find a line

70
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,328
- Oh, now you wanna stop?
- Well, we don't all have butlers.

71
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,847
Some of us actually
have to answer our own doors.

72
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,128
Oh, the horror.

73
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,366
You look familiar.

74
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,251
I see you on TV or something?

75
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,760
- Probably. I'm Thea Queen.
- Heh. Yeah, right.

76
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,206
Did you get it?

77
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,647
Tomorrow night.
Joe wants us there at 11 p.m.

78
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,768
He said to be on time, Harper.

79
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,125
I'd say I told you so
But I know you never listen

80
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,649
What's happening tomorrow at 11?

81
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,280
I'm actually focused on
what's happening right now.

82
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,044
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

83
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,644
No, no, Thea, don't.

84
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,044
- No.
- Why do you have a gun?

85
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,728
Because I'm no good with knives.

86
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,609
Look, it's just a liquor store. The guy's a creep.
Trust me, he deserves it.

87
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,804
Look, if it'll make you feel any better...

88
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,323
...I won't be armed.

89
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,209
The owner won't know that but...

90
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,045
I got you a job at my brother's club.

91
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,646
You have choices.
You don't have to be a criminal.

92
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,484
I'm not talking about phone bills.

93
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,043
I owe people.

94
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,002
People with much bigger guns than this.
Look, here in the Glades...

95
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,527
...this is pretty much the only solution.

96
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,644
No, lots of people in the Glades
live honest lives.

97
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,881
Obviously not you.

98
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,204
- You're just a waste.
- Thea. Thea.

99
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,842
- Let me make sure you get home okay.
- Don't bother.

100
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:09,044
Yeah. Mm-hm.

101
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,370
Yeah.

102
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,091
- Yeah.
- Hey, honey.

103
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,849
Here you go.

104
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,371
What's all this?

105
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,649
Well, you asked me to look
into your mother's leads on Sara...

106
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,080
...so I made some calls.

107
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,562
It looks like you did a lot more than that.

108
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,331
You're the one that said
we should do this, Laurel.

109
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,289
If there's a chance your sister...

110
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,680
- Yeah, but...
- Thank you.

111
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,207
Hi, sweetheart, I'm sorry about the mess.

112
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,409
Quentin, I just got off the phone
with the consulate in Phuket.

113
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,042
The secretary there's gonna run
Sara's photo against their database...

114
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,646
- ...see if there's a match.
- That's good work.

115
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,445
What?

116
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:02,850
Well, I guess I just thought deep down that
you were going to help Mom accept things.

117
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,048
Things you and I accepted.

118
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,570
Um...

119
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,970
Yeah, but you got to admit...

120
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,285
- ...this girl, she looks a lot like Sara.
- Sara had that same cap.

121
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,125
The Starling City Rockets.
Your dad bought it, remember?

122
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,647
Yeah, I remember.

123
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,727
- Stranger things have happened.
- Yeah. I can see that.

124
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,128
Hungrier than I thought.

125
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,722
Are you waiting for me to finish
before giving me the lecture?

126
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,164
You've been spending a lot of time
under that hood.

127
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,367
Keeps my ears warm.

128
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,766
And you've made this decision
to avoid entanglements?

129
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,811
For their protection.
The people who get close to me get hurt.

130
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,969
What's the problem?
Do you think I'm losing my grip?

131
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,522
No, it's just the opposite, really.
You seem calm.

132
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,364
Scary calm.

133
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,966
Things didn't end well with Helena,
with McKenna...

134
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,963
With Laurel.

135
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,531
With Sara.

136
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,331
- The list goes on.
- Yeah. But what do you do?

137
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,404
You hood up, you go home, you repeat.
Not much of a life.

138
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,043
The life that I'm leading for myself
doesn't leave much room for an actual life.

139
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,407
- And I don't need one.
- Wow.

140
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,166
That's a pretty bleak future
you plan on spending with no one.

141
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,528
- I'm used to isolation.
- And that is exactly what worries me.

142
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,724
You've been home for eight months, Oliver,
but I don't think you left that island yet.

143
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,321
What the hell is going on?

144
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,764
- Yeah?
- I found Nickel. Click the link I sent you.

145
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,686
This came up on every screen with
an IP address originating from the Glades.

146
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,850
If you make the Glades your home...

147
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,122
you know who this man is. John Nickel.

148
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,523
He owns your tenements,
manages your slums.

149
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,210
He provides the leaking roofs
over your heads...

150
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,887
...the lead in your pipes,
the asbestos in your walls.

151
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,365
Basically, he makes money
off of our suffering.

152
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,801
But the police aren't
interested in helping us.

153
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,566
They may have let us down, but I won't.

154
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,521
John, I want to give you the chance
to state your case.

155
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,921
Why shouldn't you be punished?

156
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,087
I knew there was bad stuff in my buildings.

157
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,009
Track him, Felicity.

158
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,680
<i>- I'm looking.
- Okay, yes, I made</i> a <i>little profit.</i>

159
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,041
At least they had a place to live.

160
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,885
Without me, people like that
would end up on the street.

161
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,929
"People like that."

162
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,126
That's all we are to guys like this.

163
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,727
John...

164
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:12,883
...I find you guilty.

165
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,566
There are plenty more people who need
to answer for their crimes against us.

166
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,604
So who's next?

167
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,127
Anything new?

168
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,521
This guy's got more than
a subscription to Wired.

169
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,808
His website's protected
by serious encryption.

170
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,450
Use that air magnet thing.

171
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,729
Oliver, no offense, but do I tell you
how to sharpen your arrows?

172
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,649
Spoke to my friend at the NSA.

173
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,485
The website code matches
a cyber crusader on their radar.

174
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,962
He hacks into fringe sites
under the user name The Savior.

175
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,884
He's a former resident of the Glades.

176
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,530
- Former?
- Yeah, a year ago...

177
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,401
...he hacked himself right off the radar.
Erased all traces of his existence.

178
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,120
- So, what happened a year ago?
- We're back.

179
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,330
I have with me Assistant District Attorney
Gavin Carnahan.

180
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,006
Now, DAs are supposed to go after bad guys.

181
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,642
But this one can't even be bothered
to bring them to trial.

182
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,684
Like the ones who killed my wife
in a bodega.

183
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,166
- Felicity?
- I'm on it.

184
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,687
You said there wasn't enough evidence.

185
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,923
You think evidence would have turned up
if she'd been killed...

186
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,481
...in one of Starling City's
nicer neighborhoods?

187
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,163
Emma Falk. Husband is Joseph Falk.

188
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,164
- What do we have on him?
- Not much, 42, former city worker.

189
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,687
Department of Transportation,
computer technician.

190
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,889
Left his job when she was killed.
One year ago today.

191
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,044
- No current phone, no current address.
- Gavin, you're a lawyer.

192
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,131
You're used to making a case. So go ahead.

193
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:54,205
I'm gonna give you 10 minutes to deliver
the closing argument of your life.

194
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,842
- Come on.
- Trying to get a lock on his signal.

195
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,408
Ten minutes to convince me
not to blow you away.

196
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,731
What did Malcolm want with you
at the hospital?

197
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,728
A target for reprisal.

198
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,407
He wants justice and he's not going to stop
until he gets it.

199
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,210
Besides, this is good.

200
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,051
I think your definition of good
requires an adjustment.

201
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,571
No, he came to me.

202
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,567
Which means he doesn't know that we're
responsible for the attempt on his life.

203
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,651
Yet.

204
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,648
What are the chances
of Malcolm discovering...

205
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,087
...who paid the Triad to assassinate him?

206
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,004
I was discreet. I wired the money...

207
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,164
...through a shell corporation I own
from an offshore account.

208
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,130
Offshore. Good. That's good.

209
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,447
I'm sending Amanda to London
for a few weeks. Just as a precaution.

210
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,126
Perhaps you should do
the same for your family.

211
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,606
There's nothing I wouldn't do
to protect my children, Frank.

212
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,286
Can I talk to you about something?
Almost-woman to woman?

213
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,647
I'm really busy right now.

214
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,643
Okay.

215
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,122
Thea.

216
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,531
Sorry. What's up?

217
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,129
I could use some advice.

218
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:56,651
I'm sort of dating this guy who could
definitely be described as a bad boy.

219
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,327
And I figured, as someone who's dated
like a gajillion of them...

220
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,164
I haven't dated a gajillion.

221
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,002
All right, guilty as charged.
You want my advice?

222
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:13,849
- Run. As fast as you possibly can.
- Yeah. That was my first instinct too, but...

223
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,689
Laurel? The Chinese embassy's on line two.
I'm transferring them over.

224
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,162
- Chinese embassy?
- It's just this case that I'm working on.

225
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,130
But we are definitely continuing
this conversation later.

226
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:33,526
Thank you so much for getting back to me.

227
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,686
I'm trying to track down the woman
in the photo that I e-mailed you.

228
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,769
You did.

229
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,370
Really?

230
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,247
And you're sure
that she's in the States now?

231
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,569
Do you happen to have an address on her?

232
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,731
- I got him!
- Shut it down.

233
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,042
Can't. He has a firewall.

234
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,248
He's working off an IPX at 23rd and Mira.

235
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,683
- You gonna hood up?
- It's the middle of the day.

236
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,008
Look! Listen! Listen to me, okay?

237
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,488
I have 53 cases on my desk right now.

238
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,326
- I don't always have time...
- You should have made time.

239
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,364
- How's Carnahan?
- Not making a persuasive argument.

240
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,922
I'm almost there.

241
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,927
- See anything?
- I'm only on the first floor.

242
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:00,846
- Just six more to go.
- There aren't resources.

243
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,168
I tried. Sorry! I'm sorry.

244
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,970
Oliver, hurry.

245
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,248
Can't find him!

246
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,845
- He's not here, Felicity.
- What?

247
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,968
I searched every office on every floor!

248
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,010
He's not here. Is this the right place?

249
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,766
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I...

250
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,641
- Oh, crap.
- What?

251
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,007
How is this possible?
This can't happen. He's...

252
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,328
- Talk to me!
- Wait.

253
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,166
- He moved. Ocean and Grand.
- On my way!

254
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,246
I took on cases that were...
That I thought I could...

255
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,482
- Win.
- Yes.

256
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,090
I'm sorry.

257
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,770
Gavin Carnahan, I find you guilty
of crimes against the Glades.

258
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,691
- Don't do this! Don't do this!
- I sentence you to death.

259
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,971
I'm at Ocean and Grand,
and it's just a vacant lot.

260
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,571
How is this possible? He's...

261
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,361
- Find the right address now!
- He's...

262
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,965
He's...

263
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,089
Oliver, it's over. Carnahan is dead.

264
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,081
Where's Diggle?

265
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,451
I asked him to leave me alone.

266
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,450
In my loud voice.

267
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,765
This wasn't your fault.

268
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,049
I was the one who was supposed
to find Carnahan...

269
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,164
...and I was the one who sent you
to that bogus location.

270
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,531
I've never seen anybody die.

271
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,610
Hey, this is the thing with what we do.

272
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,524
Sometimes we lose.

273
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,644
Maybe it is better being alone.

274
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,283
I'm not seeing anyone currently...

275
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,647
...but if I were,
I don't know how I'd tell him about today.

276
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,367
Gentlemen. Welcome.

277
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,488
So happy we're able to reach an accord.

278
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:24,043
Oh, good. Small talk.
Are we gonna get on with this?

279
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,288
As you wish. Straight to business.

280
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,681
- Circuit board. Where is it?
- Somewhere safe.

281
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,443
So get us to the boat
and then we'll tell you where it is.

282
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,809
And, of course,
you'll be honest about its location.

283
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,240
Well, I wouldn't be.

284
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:41,450
But this one's got some strange hang-up
about principles and integrity.

285
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,881
Hmm. I always imagined as much.

286
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:47,408
Which is why I'd like to make
a counterproposal. Men!

287
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,249
No.

288
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,970
- No!
- Hey!

289
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,841
Deliver back to me the circuit board
or I will kill Yao Fei's daughter.

290
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,324
So I wouldn't leave.

291
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,326
I can't imagine you want the death of
an innocent young woman on your hands.

292
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,403
Not with your principles.

293
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,164
- Hey.

294
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,684
Hi.

295
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,880
I wanted to do some research
on my own...

296
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,930
...into the evidence
that you gathered on Sara...

297
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,051
...so I called my friend from law school
who works at the Chinese embassy and...

298
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,760
The photo of the girl.

299
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,442
- I found her.
- I'm sorry. Can I borrow your phone?

300
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,729
I promised my fiance
that I'd call him before dinner.

301
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,882
Jenn, these are my parents.

302
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,765
Hi. Nice to meet you.

303
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,251
Yeah, you too.

304
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,243
I told Jenn about this photograph
that popped up in this case...

305
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,050
...that I'm working on.

306
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,971
- That's you in the picture?
- Yeah.

307
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,885
I spent six months
on an island off the coast of China.

308
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,249
That was taken in a small fishing village
named Zhengjiu.

309
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:23,324
- It's Mandarin for...
- Salvation.

310
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,287
- Are you all right, Mrs. Lance?
- Yes, I...

311
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,808
It's just, uh, you look like someone
I used to know.

312
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,804
Wow.

313
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,006
I was waiting for this.

314
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,525
Waiting for what?

315
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,604
For the whole "you can change,
I see the real you" speech.

316
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,526
Look around, Thea.
This is home sweet home for me.

317
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,763
You starve or do things
that mean you're lucky to make it to 21.

318
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,760
- I can't accept that.
- No, you can't accept me.

319
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,084
- Roy Harper?
- Yeah?

320
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,651
- Unh!
- Roy!

321
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,049
More on the story out of the Glades.

322
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,762
The kidnapper seems to have another victim
and is broadcasting the feed to his website.

323
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:54,209
A warning to viewers, this is live footage,
so we 're not sure what we're about to see.

324
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,202
Meet Roy Harper.

325
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:07,521
Arrests, larceny, robbery,
aggravated assault.

326
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,930
Yet you're out on the street.

327
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,529
Another gangbanger
in the Glades running free...

328
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,404
...like the ones who killed my wife.

329
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:21,369
I grew up in the Glades too,
and it didn't turn me into a criminal.

330
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,609
- I know that kid.
- How?

331
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,091
- Ollie?
- Tommy?

332
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,244
Oh, God, no.

333
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,089
I didn't know where else to go.

334
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,242
- You know him?
- Roy. He's my friend.

335
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,448
We were in a fight and some guy...

336
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,490
...just attacked us.
He doesn't deserve to die.

337
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:51,288
I promise you he's gonna be okay.
You stay here with Tommy, all right?

338
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,809
- Hello?
- It's Malcolm.

339
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,089
I've learned a high-ranking member
of the Triad was arrested.

340
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,766
- I should have a word with him.
- I already have.

341
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,251
He's agreed to find out who hired
his organization...

342
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,081
...to assassinate me
in return for a reduced prison sentence.

343
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,001
Tonight we should know the name or names
of the people who tried to kill me.

344
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,324
Good.

345
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,524
- What are you doing?
- So it's not Sara in the photo.

346
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,764
But she's still out there, Quentin,
and I'm going to find her.

347
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,643
Look, I understand now
that neither of you have the stomach...

348
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,804
...to continue looking for her.
And that's fine.

349
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,361
I'm sorry I involved you both.

350
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,524
You know that I would cross to hell
and back to bring her home.

351
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:02,685
But I can't! Because she's gone, Di.

352
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,401
- No.
- You gotta let go of this now.

353
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:11,001
No. I can't. I won't.

354
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,687
How did you know Sara had her hat
with her when she went on the boat?

355
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:25,251
You were so sure
that the girl in the photo was Sara...

356
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,041
...not because she was American
but because of her hat.

357
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,846
Her Starling City Rockets hat
that Dad bought her.

358
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,365
Mom...

359
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,250
...how did you know...

360
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,882
...she took her hat with her
on the Queen's Gambit with Oliver?

361
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,243
I saw her.

362
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:53,369
- What do you mean?
- I came home early that day...

363
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:56,520
...and I saw her.

364
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,530
Sara.

365
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,570
I saw her put the hat in a bag.

366
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,370
- She was packing.
- You knew she was going with him?

367
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:15,404
I told her not to. I told her not to do this.
Not to you, Laurel.

368
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,484
But she said she was in love
and she had to follow her heart.

369
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,964
Even if nobody else thought it was right.
Just like I had told her...

370
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,961
Just like I told her I once did.

371
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:34,403
So I let her go.

372
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,961
I killed her.

373
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,767
I killed my daughter.

374
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:51,323
I killed her. I'm so sorry, Quentin.

375
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,411
I'm so sorry, Quentin. I killed our baby.

376
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,646
- Anything?
- I've been going through the video...

377
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,770
...to see if there's anything
that'll tell us where this guy is.

378
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,331
I got nothing except a sound.

379
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,529
Buried in the ambient noise.
Almost rhythmic. I've isolated it.

380
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:16,330
What is that? Sounds like a car
driving over lane markers.

381
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,289
It has to be bigger than a car.

382
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,200
- Bigger than a car? What, a bus?
- No.

383
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,129
I know this.

384
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,687
I know it.

385
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,365
Come on, guys.

386
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:29,846
Felicity, show me a map.

387
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,049
Sites of the abductions
and where we've seen the signal so far.

388
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,282
Right there, right there.

389
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,690
23rd and Mira, Locksley and Adams...

390
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,330
...Wells Street down by CNRI.

391
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:45,201
- Those are all subway stops.
- Starling City doesn't have a subway.

392
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:49,410
They used to. My dad used to take me
to the Rockets game by subway.

393
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:52,484
I'd lean against the window
feeling the rhythm of the train.

394
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,722
- That's how he did it.
- What?

395
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,201
He was at 23rd and Mira,
but he was underground.

396
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,931
He used to work
for the Department of Transportation.

397
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,926
That's why he knows all the subway stops.
That's why I couldn't trace the signal.

398
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,481
- Where is he now?
- He's on the old crosstown line.

399
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,685
He'll be at the Spring Street stop
in 15 minutes.

400
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,042
Let the girl go.

401
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,244
No deal? Very well.

402
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,730
- Kill her.
- No!

403
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,368
Well, that was unexpected.

404
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,605
Slade!

405
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,561
Come on! Come on!

406
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,484
Get her to safety. Now!
I will only slow you down. Go!

407
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,007
- Papa.
- Go! You've got to go!

408
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,525
Go!

409
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,401
It's happening-

410
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,325
I'll give you 10 minutes
to state your case, Roy.

411
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:07,808
So tell us, why do you get to live?

412
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,964
I shouldn't. Just do it.

413
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,730
Kill me.

414
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,645
Go on! Kill me!

415
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,605
You really don't care if you live or die?

416
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,804
No one's gonna miss me.

417
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,809
I'm just a waste.

418
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,966
Well, then, we agree on something.

419
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,321
This world will be better
off without you in it.

420
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,169
We seem to have lost the feed.

421
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,086
We will stay on the story and keep you
up to date on any developments.

422
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,606
Let the kid go.

423
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,366
If you kill this kid,
he'll never get an opportunity to change.

424
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,251
You can give him a second chance.

425
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:42,080
We're the only ones who can save this city.

426
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,441
- We can't stop now.
- We're not the same!

427
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,880
You've killed people
for this city. So have I.

428
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,530
What's the difference between you and me?

429
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,371
Emma never got a second chance.

430
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,562
You have no idea how lonely it is.

431
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,210
Joseph. Joseph!

432
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,529
I understand being alone.

433
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,921
But it doesn't give you the right
to kill people in cold blood.

434
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,730
He deserves it.

435
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,089
Just like the gangbangers who gunned
her down. He's no different.

436
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,047
- And now I get to gun him down.
- Don't do it!

437
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:17,644
I better get going to the airport.
That red-eye to Central City.

438
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,168
I should be home in a flash.

439
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,881
Mom.

440
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,807
Call me sometime.

441
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,650
I'd really like that.

442
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:40,925
- You would?
- Of course I would.

443
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,046
You're my mother.

444
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:52,051
- I love you so much.
- I love you too.

445
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,044
It's a fine day

446
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,083
People open windows

447
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,330
It's a fine day

448
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,527
People open windows

449
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,884
- I thought you were gonna die.
- That makes two of us.

450
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,410
I probably look like a mess.

451
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,091
I'm gonna go to the bathroom
and freshen way, way up.

452
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,446
Okay.

453
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,969
It's a fine day

454
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,724
People open windows

455
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,763
Ollie?

456
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,810
Hi.

457
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,484
Hey. I heard Thea's friend was okay.

458
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,404
Yeah, that worked out okay.

459
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:37,489
This Roy is more than
just a friend, isn't he?

460
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,048
Bad boys.

461
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,804
- They hook you ever time.
- Yeah.

462
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:47,166
Oh, I think Tommy actually went home
for the night.

463
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,440
Oh.

464
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,721
You all right?

465
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,491
You seem like you're something
other than all right.

466
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,847
My mom.

467
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,322
She showed up in town this week,
and she's been...

468
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:07,841
What?

469
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,846
She had this crazy idea
that Sara was still alive.

470
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:17,082
She was so sure of it
that she kind of had me believing it also.

471
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,007
- But Sara's gone.
- Yeah.

472
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,686
I can't believe she sucked me in like that.

473
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,844
- You miss her.
- I miss them both.

474
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,963
- Thanks for listening.
- Of course.

475
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,689
Laurel?

476
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,524
You wanna have a dinner or coffee?
I don't know.

477
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,129
Why?

478
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,003
I don't want to be on an island anymore.

479
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,884
Sure.

480
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,368
- Good night.
- Good night.

481
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:24,205
Slade. The circuit board's gone.

482
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,161
Damn. Fyers played us.

483
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:38,167
While he was screwing us around,
his men were combing the woods for it.

484
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,251
Now his missile launcher
is fully operational.

485
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,721
He was never gonna let us off the island.

486
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,649
Of course he wasn't gonna help you.

487
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,411
He couldn't chance
you warning the mainland.

488
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,769
She speaks English. Yeah, well, guess what.

489
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,651
Neither one of us have any idea
what his plans are.

490
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,571
I do.

491
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,090
Thank you for coming, Frank.

492
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,170
Meeting like this is dangerous, Moira.
Particularly now.

493
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,481
Yes, I know.

494
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,360
- Malcolm knows.
- What?

495
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,484
I had no choice but to turn over
what I discovered.

496
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:23,326
The evidence of the wire transfers.
Money that you paid to assassinate him.

497
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:26,165
The money I... Ah!

498
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,450
Moira.

499
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:36,207
Mr. Merlyn thanks you
for your loyalty. You've done well.

500
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:40,649
- Now Chen's family will share his fate.
- Chen betrayed us...

501
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,169
...but his daughter didn't.
Tell Mr. Merlyn I want her to live.

502
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,045
Amanda nearly lost her life.
Now she's lost her father.

503
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,964
I think she's suffered enough.

504
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:53,647
- We must send a message.
- We have.

505
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,163
- Very well.
- Thank you.

506
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,571
- Thea's friend is upstairs.
- I saw.

507
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:35,725
You probably saw they were very happy
to see each other, if you know what I mean.

508
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:41,688
Which you probably don't wanna talk about,
because she's your baby sister.

509
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,401
You Okay?

510
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,882
Getting there. Thank you.

511
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,246
Psst.

512
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:58,602
By the way, if you ever need
to tell someone about your day...

513
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,728
...you can tell me.

514
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,206
Thanks.

515
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,244
- What's that?
- Felicity pulled that up.

516
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,085
It's an old map
of the decommissioned subway line.

517
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,403
Runs underneath
the low-rent district of the city.

518
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,005
I've seen that map before.

519
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,767
It was right in front of our faces
the entire time.

520
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,321
My father, the other
archer, the Undertaking.

521
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,247
Whatever the plan is,
it's all connected to the Glades.
