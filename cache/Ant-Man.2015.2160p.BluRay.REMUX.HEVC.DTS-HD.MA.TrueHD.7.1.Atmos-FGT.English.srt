Hello, Hank.

You're supposed to be in Moscow.

5
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,862
I took a detour...

6
00:00:29,947 --> 00:00:32,074
Through your defense lab.

Tell me that isn't what I think it is.

8

That depends if you think it's
a poor attempt to replicate my work.

Even for this group, that takes nerve.

You were instructed to go to Russia.

May I remind you, Dr. Pym,
that you're a soldier...

I let you turn me into your errand boy,

17
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,558
and now you try to steal my research?

18
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:01,937
If only you'd protected Janet
with such ferocity, Dr. Pym.

- Easy, Hank.

22
00:01:12,698 --> 00:01:14,741
and I'll show you ferocity.

23
00:01:14,825 --> 00:01:16,410
Don't look at me. You said it.

24
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,830
I formally tender my resignation.

25

We don't accept it. Formally.

Yes.

to replicating his work.

00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,703
What are you doing?

163
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:15,829
Hmm?

164
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,915
Why are you telling my life story
to these guys?

165
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:20,250
What do you want?

166
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,334
LUIS: Okay.

167
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,837
My cousin talked to this guy
two weeks ago

168
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,172
- about this little perfect job.
- No way.

169
00:08:26,256 --> 00:08:28,675
No, no, no. Wait!
This guy... This guy fits your M.O.

170
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:29,718
No!

171
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,095
I'm finished, man.
I'm not going back to jail.

172
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,222
It's some retired millionaire
living off his golden parachute.

173
00:08:34,305 --> 00:08:36,266
It's a perfect Scott Lang mark!

174
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,435
I don't care. I'm out.

175
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,496
Dr. Pym?

176
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,999
Yes. I'm still alive.

00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,090

178
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,635
HANK: Perhaps that will suffice.

179
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,848
Very sorry, sir. Please come in.

180
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:21,144
(SOFTLY) Is that Hank Pym?

181
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,524
Good morning, Hank.

182
00:09:27,776 --> 00:09:28,777
Hope.

183
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,362
Would it kill you to call me Dad?

184
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:35,200
Dr. Cross will be so pleased that
you could find the time to join us today.

185
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,660
More like "thrilled."

186
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:42,248
I was surprised to receive
any kind of invitation from you, Darren.

187
00:09:42,332 --> 00:09:43,750
What's the occasion?

188
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,710
Oh, you'll see. Won't he, Hope?

189
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:51,925
We're ready for you inside.

190
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,094
Ouch.

191
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:58,640
I guess some old wounds
never heal, huh?

192
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,391
Don't worry, she's in good hands.

193
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:01,643
(BEEPS)

194
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:04,354
You're in for a treat.

195
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:10,777
Long time, no see, Dr. Pym.
How's retirement?

196
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,029
How's your face?

197
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,826
After you.

198
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,628
Now, before we start,
I'd like to introduce a very special guest.

199
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:31,047
This company's founder and my mentor,

200
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:32,757
Dr. Hank Pym.

201
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:50,358
When I took over this company
for Dr. Pym,

202
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,652
I immediately started
researching a particle

203
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,488
that could change
the distance between atoms,

204
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:58,408
while increasing density and strength.

205
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,995
Why this revolutionary idea
remained buried

206
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:06,332
beneath the dust and cobwebs of
Hank's research, I couldn't tell you.

207
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,334
But just imagine,

208
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:12,672
a soldier the size of an insect.

209
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,677
The ultimate secret weapon.

210
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,054
(YELLING)

211
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,649
An Ant-Man.

212
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:32,942
(CHUCKLES)

213
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,986
That's what they called you.
Right, Hank?

214
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,783
Silly, I know.

215
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,327
Propaganda.

216
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,495
Tales to astonish!

217
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:47,957
Trumped-up BS to scare the USSR.

218
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:51,878
Hank, will you tell our guests
what you told me

219
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:55,465
every single time I asked you,

220
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:59,552
"Was the Ant-Man real?"

221
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,262
Just a tall tale.

222
00:12:01,346 --> 00:12:02,388
Right.

223
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:05,558
Because how could anything
so miraculous possibly be real?

224
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:19,572
Well, I was inspired by the legend
of the Ant-Man.

225
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,492
And with my breakthrough
shrinking inorganic material,

226
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,620
I thought, could it be possible
to shrink a person?

227
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,122
Could that be done?

228
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,919
Well, it's not a legend anymore.

229

Oh, no.

The Yellowjacket is an all-purpose

Don't be crude, Frank.

259
00:13:59,589 --> 00:14:02,717
It's not a suit, it's a vessel.

What's the matter?
You're not impressed?

261
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,638
No, I'm impressed. I'm also concerned.

262
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:10,683
Imagine what our enemies
could do with this tech.

263
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:13,353
We should have a longer conversation
about that, Frank.

You seem a bit shocked.

269

Darren, there's a reason
that I buried these secrets.

We could have done this together, Hank.
But you ruined that.

That's why you're the past
and I'm the future.

watching me sleep, this whole time?

00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:19,023
Yes.

641
00:39:19,107 --> 00:39:20,275
Why?

642
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:23,111
Because the last time you were here,
you stole something.

643
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,281
Oh. Oh.

644

651
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:47,010

Um... Whose pajamas are these?

655
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:01,482
How am I supposed to do this?

656
00:40:07,697 --> 00:40:10,783
All right, just one step at a time.

657
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:13,912
Ugh!

I don't step on you. Deal?

659
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,174
HOPE: I could take down the servers
and Cross wouldn't even know it.

660
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,467
We don't need this guy.

661
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,011
I assume that you've already
met my daughter, Hope.

662
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,680
I did. She's great.

663
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,974
She doesn't think that we need you.

664
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:36,434
We don't. We can do this ourselves.

665
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:39,729
I go to all this effort
to let you steal my suit,

666
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:42,398
and then Hope has you arrested.

667
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:45,485
Okay, we can try this and when he fails,
I'll do it myself.

668
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,195
She's a little bit anxious.

669
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:49,197
It has to do with this job,

670
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,783
which, judging by the fact
that you're sitting opposite me,

671
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:54,118
I take it that you're interested in.

672
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:55,286
What job?

673
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,537
Would you like some tea?

674
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,790
Uh... Sure.

675
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,458
I was very impressed with

676
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:03,336
how you managed to get
past my security system.

677
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:07,590
Freezing that metal
was particularly clever.

678
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:09,092
Were you watching me?

679
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:12,387
Scott, I've been watching you for a while.

680
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,847
Ever since you robbed Vista Corp.

681
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:18,101
Oh! Excuse me.

682
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,144
"Burgled" Vista Corp.

683
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:25,733
Vista's security system was one of
the most advanced in the business.

684
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:27,527
It was supposed to be unbeatable.

685
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,529
But you beat it.

686
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:30,947
Would you like some sugar?

687
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,573
Yeah, thanks.

688
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,745
You know what? I'm okay.

689
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:44,877
How do you make them do that?

690
00:41:44,961 --> 00:41:47,588
Ants can lift objects
50 times their weight.

691
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:51,300
They build, farm,
they cooperate with each other.

692
00:41:51,384 --> 00:41:53,553
Right. But how do you
make them do that?

693
00:41:55,513 --> 00:42:01,102
I use electromagnetic waves
to stimulate their olfactory nerve center.

694
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,188
I speak to them.

695
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:06,649
I can go anywhere, hear anything,

696
00:42:06,733 --> 00:42:08,151
and see everything.

697
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,111
And still know absolutely nothing.

698
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:11,738
I'm late to meet Cross.

You don't need to raise your hand, Scott.

702
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:22,957
Sorry, I just have one question.

703
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:25,126
Who are you, who is she,
what the hell's going on,

704
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,878
and can I go back to jail now?

705
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,337
Come with me.

706
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:33,092
40 years ago, I created a formula
that altered atomic relative distance.

707
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:34,385
SCOTT: Huh?

708
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:36,721
I learned how to change
the distance between atoms.

709
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,514
That's what powers the suit.

710
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:40,266
That's why it works.

711
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:42,477

- But it was dangerous.

714
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:52,236
It was too dangerous.

715
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:55,406
So I hid it from the world.

716
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:59,243
And that's when I switched gears
and I started my own company.

717
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:01,245
Pym Tech.

718
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:02,455
Yes.

719
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:07,210
I took on a young protégé
called Darren Cross.

720
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:08,544
SCOTT: Darren Cross.

721
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:09,670
He's a big deal.

722
00:43:09,754 --> 00:43:12,215
But before he was a big deal,
he was my assistant.

723
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:16,636
I thought I saw something in him.
The son I never had, perhaps.

724
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:19,013
He was brilliant,
but as we became close,

725
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:22,683
he began to suspect
that I wasn't telling him everything.

726
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:26,437
He heard rumors about
what was called the Pym Particle,

727
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:29,690
and he became obsessed
with recreating my formula.

728
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:31,275
But I wouldn't help him.

729
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:35,196
So he conspired against me and
he voted me out of my own company.

730
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,781
How could he do that?

731
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:39,659
The board's chairman
is my daughter, Hope.

732
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,077
She was the deciding vote.

733
00:43:43,246 --> 00:43:44,664
But she came back to me

734
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:48,126
when she saw how close
Cross was to cracking my formula.

735
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:51,420
The process is highly volatile.

by a specialized helmet,

it can affect the brain's chemistry.

738

I don't think Darren realizes this,

739
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:03,266
and, you know, he's not
the most stable guy to begin with.

740

So, what do you want from me?

a shot at redemption.

00:48:05,049 --> 00:48:07,385
- Why don't you wear the suit?
- (SIGHING)

800
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:09,678
You think I don't want to?

801
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:10,971
I can't.

802
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,475
I spent years wearing it,

803
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:17,311
and it took a toll on me.

804
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,443
(SIGHS)

805
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:26,028
You're our only option.

806
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:34,328
Before Hope lost her mother,

807
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:38,332
she used to look at me like
I was the greatest man in the world.

808
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:43,504
And now she looks at me
and there's just disappointment.

809
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:48,843
It's too late for me,

810
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:51,804
but not for you.

811
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,806
This is your chance.

812
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:57,518
The chance to earn that look
in your daughter's eyes.

813
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:01,480
To become the hero
that she already thinks you are.

814
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:04,692
It's not about saving our world.

815
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:08,404
It's about saving theirs.

816
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,200
Damn. That was a good speech.

817
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:14,869
Scott,

818
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:19,707
I need you to be the Ant-Man.

819
00:49:22,877 --> 00:49:24,128
In the right hands,

820
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:27,506
the relationship between man and suit
is symbiotic.

821
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:31,343
The suit has power.
The man harnesses that power.

822
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:34,263
You need to be skillful, agile,
and above all,

823
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:35,556
you need to be fast.

824
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,558
You should be able to shrink and grow

825
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:38,809
on a dime.

826
00:49:39,435 --> 00:49:42,730
So your size always suits your needs.

827
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:45,649
Now dive through the keyhole, Scott.

828
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:49,695
You charge big, you dive small,
then you emerge big.

829
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:53,115
- (THUDDING)
- SCOTT: Ow!

830
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:55,409
- (THUDDING)
- Ahhh!

831
00:49:55,868 --> 00:49:57,411
- (THUDDING)
- Ow!

832
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:58,746
Useless.

833
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:02,500
When you're small,
energy's compressed,

834
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:04,502
so you have the force
of a 200-pound man

835
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:07,880
behind a fist a 100th of an inch wide.
You're like a bullet.

836
00:50:07,963 --> 00:50:11,300
You punch too hard, you kill someone.
Too soft, it's a love tap.

837
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:12,843
In other words,
you have to know how to punch.

838
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:14,720
I was in prison for three years.
I know how to punch.

839
00:50:14,803 --> 00:50:16,514
Show me.

840
00:50:16,597 --> 00:50:18,098
- Terrible.
- You wanna show me how to punch?

841
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:19,934
Show me...

842
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:21,310
(GROANS)

843
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:23,145
That's how you punch.

844
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:25,981
- She's been looking forward to this.
- No kidding.

845
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:28,692
Hope trained in martial arts
at a difficult time.

846
00:50:28,776 --> 00:50:30,861
Oh, by "difficult time,"
he means when my mother died.

847
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:32,988
We lost her in a plane crash.

848
00:50:33,072 --> 00:50:34,782
It's bad enough
you won't tell me how she died.

849
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,408
Could you please stop
telling me that lie?

850
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:38,285
We're working, here.

851
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,040
All right, princess.
Let's get back to work.

852
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:46,168
Were you going for the hand?

853
00:50:52,508 --> 00:50:54,635
You know, I think this regulator
is holding me back.

854
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:57,388
Do not screw with the regulator.

855
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:59,223
If that regulator is compromised,

856
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:00,849
you would go subatomic.

857
00:51:00,933 --> 00:51:02,309
What does that mean?

858
00:51:03,394 --> 00:51:05,563
It means that you would enter
a quantum realm.

859
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:07,064
What does that mean?

860
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:11,652
It means that you would enter a reality
where all concepts of time and space

861
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:12,778
become irrelevant

862
00:51:12,861 --> 00:51:15,698
as you shrink for all eternity.

863
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:19,034
Everything that you know

864
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:20,411
and love,

865
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:22,913
gone forever.

866
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:27,126
Cool. Yeah, if it ain't broke...

867
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:28,544
You've learned about the suit,

868
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:31,338
but you've yet to learn
about your greatest allies,

869
00:51:32,673 --> 00:51:33,716
the ants.

870
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,593
Loyal, brave,

871
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:37,469
<i>and your partners on this job.</i>

872
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:46,437
HOPE: Paratrechina longicornis.
<i>Commonly known as crazy ants.</i>

873
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,689
<i>They're lightning fast
and can conduct electricity,</i>

874
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,233
<i>which makes them useful
to fry out enemy electronics.</i>

875
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:52,985
You're not so crazy.

around the clock.</i>

885

We'll need you to take him out
to deactivate the security systems.

SCOTT: Okay, who's next?

887
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:31,106
HOPE: Paraponera clavata.

888

SCOTT: <i>I know. Bullet ants, right?</i>

Number 1 on the Schmidt pain index?

(YELLS)

892
00:52:39,198 --> 00:52:41,116
HOPE: <i>The Yellowjacket pod
is hermetically sealed,</i>

893
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,493
and the only access point is a tube

894
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:45,329
we estimate to be about
5 millimeters in diameter.

895
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:47,247
Why do I have a sick feeling
in my stomach?

896
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:49,541
HOPE: <i>The tube is protected
by a laser grid,</i>

897
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:51,377
and we can only power that down
for 15 seconds.

898
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:54,046
You're gonna need to signal
the crazy ants to blow the servers,

899
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:58,217
retrieve the suit, and exit the vaults
before the backup power comes on.

900
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,469
HOPE: Camponotus pennsylvanicus.

901
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,721
Alternatively known as a carpenter ant.

902

Ideal for ground and air transport.

Wait a minute, I know this guy.

904
00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:10,938
I'm gonna call him "Ant-thony."

905

That's good. That's very good.

have to learn how to control him.

Do you have any idea what

You have a daughter.

I'm doing this for her.

You know, when my mother died,
I didn't see him for two weeks.

942
00:55:40,045 --> 00:55:41,004
He was in grief.

943
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:42,464
Yeah, so was I, and I was seven.

944
00:55:42,548 --> 00:55:45,133
And he never came back.
Not in any way that counted.

He just sent me off to boarding school.

with all that's at stake,

00:55:52,558 --> 00:55:55,686
just maybe we might have a chance
of making peace.

But, even now,
he still wants to shut me out.

He doesn't wanna shut you out.
He trusts you.

That's why I'm here.

00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:23,171
He would rather lose this fight
than lose you.

959
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,133
Anyway...

960
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:30,637
You know,
I didn't know you had a daughter

961
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:32,931
when I called the cops on you.

962
00:56:36,977 --> 00:56:38,145
What's her name?

963
00:56:38,979 --> 00:56:40,480
Cassie.

964
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,983
It's a pretty name.

965
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:49,239
You have to clear your mind, Scott.
You have to make your thoughts precise.

966
00:56:49,323 --> 00:56:51,283
That's how it works.

967
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:53,827
Think about Cassie.

968
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:57,831
About how badly you want to see her.
And use that to focus.

969
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:08,342
Open your eyes

970
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,802
and just think about
what you want the ants to do.

971
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:34,868
That's good!

972
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:55,639
Your mother convinced me

973
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:58,767
to let her join me on my missions.

974
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:01,478
They called her the Wasp.

975
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:03,772
She was born to it.

976
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,401
And there's not a day that goes by

977
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:11,279
that I don't regret having said yes.

978
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:17,411
It was 1987.

979
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:22,708
Separatists had hijacked
a Soviet missile silo in Kursk

980
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:27,212
and launched an ICBM
at the United States.

981
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:37,806
<i>The only way to the internal mechanics</i>

982
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:39,808
<i>was through solid titanium.</i>

983
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:53,822
<i>I knew I had to shrink between
the molecules to disarm the missile.</i>

984
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:57,159
<i>But my regulator had sustained
too much damage.</i>

985
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:00,287
<i>Your mother,</i>

986
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:01,747
<i>she didn't hesitate.</i>

987
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:05,500
Janet! No!

988
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:14,760
She turned off her regulator

989
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:17,220
and went subatomic

990
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:20,807
to deactivate the bomb.

991
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:24,436
And she was gone.

992
00:59:28,857 --> 00:59:30,984
Your mom died a hero.

993
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:35,989
And I spent the next 10 years

994
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:40,410
trying to learn all I could
about the quantum realm.

995
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:46,124
You were trying to bring her back.

996
00:59:47,751 --> 00:59:51,338
But all I learned was we know nothing.

997
00:59:56,343 --> 00:59:58,178
It's not your fault.

998
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:02,015
She made her choice.

999
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:11,191
(VOICE BREAKING)
But why didn't you tell me that sooner?

1000
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:14,236
I was trying to protect you.

1001
01:00:16,071 --> 01:00:17,697
I lost your mother.

1002
01:00:19,908 --> 01:00:22,577
I didn't mean to lose you, too.

1003
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:24,788
I'm sorry.

1004
01:00:28,208 --> 01:00:29,417
This is awesome.

1005
01:00:30,502 --> 01:00:32,170
It's awesome, you know?

1006
01:00:32,254 --> 01:00:34,339
You guys are breaking down walls,
you're healing.

1007
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:36,883
It's important.

1008
01:00:39,803 --> 01:00:41,263
I ruined the moment, didn't I?

1009
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:43,056
Yes, you did. Yes.

1010
01:00:44,224 --> 01:00:46,143
I'm going to make some tea.

1011
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:52,858
Nailed it!

1012
01:01:02,117 --> 01:01:04,161
That's a good boy, Ant-thony.

1013
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:36,902
HANK: <i>The final phase of your training
will be a stealth incursion.</i>

1014
01:01:36,985 --> 01:01:38,153
SCOTT: It's freezing!

1015
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:40,572
You couldn't make a suit
with a flannel lining?

1016
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:44,159
You must retrieve this prototype
of a signal decoy.

1017
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:46,953
It's a device that I invented
during my S.H.I.E.L.D. days.

1018
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:48,705
HOPE: We need it to counteract
the transmission blockers

1019
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:50,665
that Cross installed in the Futures vault.

1020
01:01:52,167 --> 01:01:53,668
It's currently collecting dust

1021
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:56,880
in one of Howard Stark's old
storage facilities in upstate New York.

1022
01:01:56,963 --> 01:01:58,924
<i>Should be a piece of cake.</i>

1023
01:01:59,007 --> 01:02:00,884
You're over the target area.

1024
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:03,261
Disengage now, Scott!

1025
01:02:03,345 --> 01:02:04,512
Squadron A, go!

1026
01:02:04,596 --> 01:02:05,889
B, go!

1027
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:09,434
C, go!

1028
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:12,896
All right, Ant-thony,
please don't drop me this time.

1029
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:17,067
Oh, it feels like a big leap
from sugar cubes to this!

1030
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,193
Stay calm.

1031
01:02:20,028 --> 01:02:21,905
SCOTT: Guys?
We might have a problem.

1032
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:25,408
Hank, didn't you say
this was some old warehouse?

1033
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:26,534
It's not!

1034
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:29,829
<i>You son of a bitch!</i>

1035
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:34,042
- Scott, get out of there.
- Abort!

1036
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:35,168
<i>Abort now!</i>

1037
01:02:35,252 --> 01:02:38,004
No, it's okay.
It doesn't look like anyone's home.

1038
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:40,131
Ant-thony, get me to the roof!

1039
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:42,092
He's gonna lose the suit.

1040
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,677
He's gonna lose his life.

1041
01:02:47,681 --> 01:02:48,682
(GRUNTS)

1042
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:51,643
<i>All right, I'm on the roof
of the target building.</i>

1043
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:54,354
Somebody's home, Scott.

1044
01:02:57,524 --> 01:02:58,817
MAN:
<i>What's going on down there, Sam?</i>

1045
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:00,026
SCOTT: It's the Falcon!

1046
01:03:00,694 --> 01:03:02,821
I had a sensor trip
but I'm not seeing anything.

1047
01:03:03,405 --> 01:03:04,406
Wait a second.

1048
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:06,449
HANK: Abort, Scott! Abort now!

1049
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:08,076
It's okay. He can't see me.

1050
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:09,202
I can see you.

1051
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:10,412
He can see me.

1052
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,708
Hi. I'm Scott.

1053
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,418
Did he just say, "Hi, I'm Scott"?

1054
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:19,796
- What are you doing here?
- First off, I'm a big fan.

1055
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:21,506
Appreciate it. So, who the hell are you?

1056
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:23,508
I'm Ant-Man.

1057
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:24,843
"Ant-Man"?

1058
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:27,012
What? You haven't heard of me?

1059
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:28,847
No, you wouldn't have heard of me.

1060
01:03:29,264 --> 01:03:30,724
You wanna tell me what you want?

1061
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:33,226
I was hoping I could grab
a piece of technology.

1062
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:35,020
Just for a few days. I'm gonna return it.

1063
01:03:35,103 --> 01:03:37,731
I need it to save the world.
You know how that is.

1064
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:39,232
I know exactly how that is.

1065
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:41,192
Located the breach.

1066
01:03:41,276 --> 01:03:42,444
- Bringing him in.
- Sorry about this!

1067
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,742
What the hell are you doing?

1068
01:03:51,703 --> 01:03:54,331
FALCON: Breach is an adult male,
who has some sort of shrinking tech.

1069
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:08,803
SCOTT: Sorry!

1070
01:04:08,887 --> 01:04:10,388
Look, I'm sorry about this. Sorry.

1071
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:12,140
That's enough!

1072
01:04:33,953 --> 01:04:35,038
(GROANING)

1073
01:04:35,205 --> 01:04:36,873
Ant-thony! A little help!

1074
01:04:49,511 --> 01:04:50,637
I've lost visual.

01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,147
He's inside my pack!

01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:02,273
Sorry!

1078
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:04,859
You seem like a really great guy.

1079
01:05:14,702 --> 01:05:16,246
(GRUNTING)

1080
01:05:30,218 --> 01:05:34,013
It's really important to me
that Cap never finds out about this.

1081
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:40,812
That was completely irresponsible
and dangerous!

1082
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:43,731
You jeopardized everything!

1083
01:05:59,706 --> 01:06:01,291
You got it.

1084
01:06:04,294 --> 01:06:05,295
Well done.

1085
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:06,337
SCOTT: Wait a minute.

1086
01:06:06,421 --> 01:06:07,839
Did you just compliment me?

1087
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:10,383
- He did, didn't he?
- Kind of sounded like he did.

1088
01:06:10,884 --> 01:06:12,343
(BEEPING SOFTLY)

1089
01:06:12,427 --> 01:06:13,720
I was good, wasn't I?

01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:15,180
(SCOFFS)

1091
01:06:15,263 --> 01:06:18,892
Hey, how about the fact that
I fought an Avenger and didn't die?

1092
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:21,478
Let us not dwell on the past.

1093
01:06:21,561 --> 01:06:23,646
We gotta finish our planning.

1094
01:06:26,024 --> 01:06:27,692
HOPE: Don't mind him.

1095
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:29,235
You did good.

1096
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:37,368
Darren.

1097
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:42,040
How the hell did you get in here?

1098
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:45,502
You left the front door open, Hank.

1099
01:06:45,919 --> 01:06:46,878
It's official.

1100
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:48,087
You're old.

1101
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:49,839
The plans.

1102
01:06:51,216 --> 01:06:52,842
He will kill him.

1103
01:06:56,054 --> 01:06:58,765
Well, to what do I owe this pleasure?

1104
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:01,267
I have good news.

1105
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:02,602
Really?

1106
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:04,437
What's that?

1107
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:09,651
Pym Tech, the company you created,

1108
01:07:09,734 --> 01:07:13,530
is about to become one of the most
profitable operations in the world.

1109
01:07:13,613 --> 01:07:17,367
We're anticipating $15 billion in sales,
tomorrow alone.

1110
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:25,124
You're welcome.

1111
01:07:29,462 --> 01:07:31,965
I know this is odd,
but I'd like you to be there.

1112
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:34,634
This is my moment. I want you to see it.

1113
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:37,428
Sure, Darren. Yeah, sure.

1114
01:07:37,512 --> 01:07:38,805
I'll be there.

1115
01:07:55,863 --> 01:07:57,323
What did you see in me?

1116
01:07:58,491 --> 01:07:59,909
I don't know what you mean.

1117
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:03,413

Then why did you push me away?

1121
01:08:13,506 --> 01:08:16,843

<i>I still get nothing but contempt from him.</i>

Full sensors at all entrances

1138
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:09,646
and exterior air vents
fitted with steel micro-mesh.

He's lost his mind, and he's onto you.

But he is not onto you.

1143

He's adding full body scanners
to all entrances

The water main.

1147

You can't add security to a water main.

1148
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:39,467
The pressure is too strong,
but if we can decrease it,

1149
01:09:39,550 --> 01:09:40,760
that's how I get in.

1150
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:43,012
Somebody would have to reach
the building's control center

1151
01:09:43,096 --> 01:09:44,472
to change the water pressure.

A fake security guard on the inside
to de-pressurize the water system,

1156
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:55,858
somebody else to hack in
to the power supply

1157
01:09:55,942 --> 01:09:57,360
and kill the laser grid,

1158
