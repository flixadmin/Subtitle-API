I don't know. Maybe I'm just worried

people are gonna treat me differently

good idea that me and the team

Hey. Ever since you became captain,

you've been busting your ass
to earn their trust and respect,

so you keep doing what you're doing

because they're gonna hate

- Last night.

Figured it was some punk-ass pranking me

- What, did you get one, too?

00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,569
And so did Laurel. We've been
trying to track down who did it.

178
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:31,400
We thought maybe it was about
a case we worked together,

I thought Kullens was
in jail for helping Diaz.

JOHN: Yeah. Well, apparently,
he had a very good lawyer

192
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,409
because he got out a month ago.

we were looking at last week?

Kullens did have his throat
slit, same as the other two.

196
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,179
I mean, the only
difference is that Kullens

197
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,210
was the only victim to leave
behind one of these notes.

198
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,659
Look familiar?

199
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,619
I spoke to the families
of the other victims,

200

and they did get notes, as well.

- Right.

What about Laurel?

You said that she got a note, too.

She did, but she's fine. She's

Kullens was against vigilantes,

and we didn't even know
the other two victims.

There has to be a connection.

When I was undercover in Central City,

with your grandparents alone.

You're a convicted felon.

You were absent for most of his life,

338

and then once you showed up... heh...

339
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:09,089
He's kidnapped, he's sent
into hiding from a mob boss.

I'm his father, Frank.

By blood maybe,

342

391
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:34,929
Eight murders over
the course of 2 months.

392
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:37,099
And this is definitely the
same guy we're dealing with?

393
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,929
Yeah. Analysis of the wound
confirms the same angle of entry

394
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:42,389
in all the murders here
and in Central City.

395
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:46,660
The question is why pack
up and bring the fun here?

396
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:49,499
Yeah. That really is the missing
piece of the puzzle, isn't it?

397
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,759
Doesn't seem to be

398
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,509
any obvious connection
between the victims.

399
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:55,599
Actually, maybe there is.

400
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,619
They all had elevated levels
of magnesium in their blood.

401
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,519
But their tox screens came back clear.

402
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,090
Well, that's because increased
magnesium alone isn't a red flag,

403
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,670
but if you combine that with
decreased levels of red blood cells,

404
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,419
then you have a drug called mivacurium.

405
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,129
It's a neuromuscular blocking agent.

Captain Singh said it looked like
the victims had been immobilized.

407
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,270
It's because they had been drugged.

408

Mivacurium is extremely rare.
