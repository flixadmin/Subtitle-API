That you need to use violence

428
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:18,333
But every Friday,
I came up with a new excuse

429
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:21,291
to go out partying
because I just had to feel alive.

430
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,958
So I haven't matured as much as I thought.

431
00:30:27,708 --> 00:30:29,958
Dani, we used to go out every fucking day.

432
00:30:31,625 --> 00:30:33,500
I think that we've matured a little bit.

433
00:30:33,583 --> 00:30:35,375
I felt like I didn't fit in.

434
00:30:38,125 --> 00:30:39,375
And that makes me sad.

435

<font color="#87CEFA">(blows a raspberry, sniffles)</font>

436
00:30:42,875 --> 00:30:45,875
And you know what I kept thinking about,
even in my paradise?

437
00:30:48,083 --> 00:30:49,083
The two of us.

438
00:30:50,416 --> 00:30:53,125
I remember how we were
the last ones to leave the discos.

439
00:30:53,208 --> 00:30:56,333
I even called you once
from a phone booth at 6:00 a.m.

440
00:30:56,416 --> 00:30:57,656
but it rang once and I hung up.

441
00:30:57,708 --> 00:30:59,916
You got a call from Indonesia, remember?

442
00:31:00,958 --> 00:31:02,750
- Mm-hmm.
- <font color="#87CEFA">(Denver chuckles)</font>

443
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:05,416
I did get a missed call from Indonesia

444
00:31:06,041 --> 00:31:08,666
at 1:15 in the morning. <font color="#87CEFA">(chuckles)</font>

445
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:10,833
That was because of the time difference.

446
00:31:14,125 --> 00:31:17,625
So are you telling me
that, um, in paradise,

447
00:31:18,416 --> 00:31:20,500
on a fucking amazing remote beach,

448
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,833
watching the sunrise,

449
00:31:24,041 --> 00:31:25,666
you thought about me, Dani?

450
00:31:26,458 --> 00:31:27,458
So much.

451
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:31,166
About Sundays when they turned
the lights on in the disco

452
00:31:31,250 --> 00:31:33,583
- and our feet were stuck to the floor?
- <font color="#87CEFA">(both chuckle)</font>

453
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:36,833
Is that what you missed
while you were in paradise?

454
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:40,625
Well...

455
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,291
Well, that sucks. <font color="#87CEFA">(sniffles)</font>

458
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:54,250

"I'll go for it, I don't care."

459
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:57,541
Because you can't waste your life
wishing you were with someone.

460
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:01,708
But then I saw you,
and I said, "Uh, Mm-mm. No."

461

if you don't." <font color="#87CEFA">(chuckles)</font>

462
00:32:05,708 --> 00:32:07,500

He spends so much time alone underwater,
breathing a mix of oxygen and helium,

511
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:11,583
that he's realized his wallet is full

of photos of the seven families
he hasn't had.

513
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:17,750
His children call him "<font color="#00FF7F"><i>güey</i></font>" and "sir"
because nobody calls a stranger "Dad."

514
00:35:17,833 --> 00:35:20,041
That's why he wants
to get involved in our heist,

515
00:35:20,125 --> 00:35:23,791
to see if he can have a family
that isn't just on photo paper.

516

By the way,
tell the foreman we charge 50% up front.

we should cover the cost in advance.
