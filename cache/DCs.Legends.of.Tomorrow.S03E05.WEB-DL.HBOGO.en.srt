1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,960
<i>Time travel is real,
and so are its consequences.</i>

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,760
<i>When a terrible time paradox
put all of history in peril,</i>

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,480
<i>an elite team was formed.</i>

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:10,120
<i>Their job... to protect history</i>

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,800
<i>and repair these so-called
anachronisms.</i>

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,120
<i>Unfortunately,
this is not that elite team.</i>

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,000
<i>And yet, this team of misfits
and outcasts is determined</i>

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,840
<i>to fix the history
which they have broken.</i>

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:25,000
<i>Not because they are heroes,
but because they are legends.</i>

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,120
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

11
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,520
Seeing Stein with his grandkid
earlier...

12
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,800
You two are inseparable. Literally.

13
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,320
I want to break up Firestorm.

14
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,840
<i>Your totem's strength grows</i>

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:38,080
<i>when the threats that you must
face become more powerful.</i>

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,960
But you cannot face
this new threat alone.

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,440
That amulet is a totem.

18
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,320
We're bound together somehow.

19
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,520
Cut the crap and tell me
what we're facing here.

20
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,240
That information is need-to-know.

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,360
The only thing you need to know...

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,640
your ridiculous team
could never handle it.

23
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,600
They are the reason
Mallus is a threat.

24
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,600
And there might just come a day

25
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,480
when we need the Legends
to do what they do best.

26
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,760
You best stop following me, guv.

27
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,200
That is a most impressive scream.

28
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:33,040
In another era, you could have
a career alongside Vincent Price.

29
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,400
Rigor Mortis hasn't set in.

30
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,240
He's been dead less than four hours.

31
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,880
Extreme pallor in the face
and fingernails

32
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,360
suggest rapid blood loss,
yet not a drop to be seen.

33
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,480
Killed off-site,

34
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,080
his body dumped here,

35
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,200
far from the illustrious streets
of his upbringing.

36
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,720
A handkerchief with
his college crest...

37
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,320
a graduation gift, no doubt.

38
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,040
What do you make of that?

39
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,040
Improbably,
it appears that our killer is...

40
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,880
a vampire.

41
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,440
{\an5}You sure you want to do this?
Break up Firestorm?

42
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,320
{\an5}Well, I'm sure Grey wants
off the ship,

43
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,560
{\an5}but I'm sure that can't happen

44
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,400
{\an5}if we're still bonded to each other,
so...

45
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,040
{\an5}Yeah, but your bond
isn't just physical.

46
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,480
{\an5}You guys have been psychically
bonded for over three years.

47
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,160
{\an5}Yeah, and it's been no picnic,
let me tell you.

48
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,960
Last time I got laid,
afterwards Grey said to me,

49
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,000
<i>Well done, Jefferson.</i>I mean...

50
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,360
{\an5}Could have done without knowing that.

51
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,640
Does Grey...

52
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,560
{\an5}I mean, Marty, know that
you want to break up with him?

53
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,800
No clue. But if he did,
he'd say it was too dangerous.

54
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,920
Well, if you're really
determined to do this,

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,200
{\an5}severing your psychic connection
could give us some...

56
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,160
much needed mental space to figure
out how to untie the nuclear knot.

57
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,280
Well, let's do it.

58
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,960
Here goes.

59
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,680
{\an5}Oh, I forgot.

60
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,280
{\an5}There might be a couple side effects.

61
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,000
What side effects?

62
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,080
Just, like, you know,
facial swelling,

63
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,680
{\an5}maybe a little
gastrointestinal upset...

64
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,560
oh, and short-term memory loss.

65
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,520
{\an5}- How do you feel?
- Oh, normal.

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,160
{\an5}Except, I'm not craving grapefruit.

67
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,520
Okay.

68
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,600
{\an5}Ray, it's 9.00am,
and I'm not craving grapefruit!

69
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,760
- Delightful.
- Let me get this straight.

70
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,040
{\an5}This ship can make any kind
of food you can imagine,

71
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,200
{\an5}and you three picked grapefruit,
a bran muffin, and oatmeal.

72
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,080
{\an5}After you try everything,
you go back to the basics.

73
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,200
{\an5}I lived my whole life eating rations
and bland food.

74
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,040
{\an5}From now on, I eat like a queen.

75
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,080
{\an5}I'm glad you left 2042.

76
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,120
{\an5}Actually, I wanted to talk to you
guys about going back to 2042.

77
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,960
{\an5}Or better yet, 2041.

78
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,760
{\an5}I was thinking, why is my family dead
when I'm on a time machine?

79
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,440
{\an5}Unfortunately,
that's not how this works.

80
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,080
{\an5}I thought you could change the past.

81
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:04,560
We can correct the past.

82
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,760
And the future, but...

83
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,920
- we don't change it.
- Why not?

84
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,680
Because doing so could
cause unforeseen,

85
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,680
possibly even disastrous
consequences.

86
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,560
{\an5}It's a temporal butterfly effect,
if you will.

87
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,120
Try not doing something
that would save your brother's life.

88
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,360
Does a sister count?

89
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,880
<i>What's up, shipmates?</i>

90
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,080
I got exciting news to share.

91
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,200
Team meeting in ten minutes.

92
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,280
<i>And, Mick, I have beer.</i>

93
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,720
One lousy beer for breakfast.

94
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,040
{\an5}- It's breakfast?
- Yeah.

95
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,520
What time did you go
to bed last night, buddy?

96
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,440
{\an5}I didn't. Drank a lot of coffee.
Can you tell?

97
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,840
{\an5}Nate, why are we staring
at an anachronism map?

98
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,240
Because, Captain,
I did a deep dive on the data.

99
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,920
And the anachronisms we created

100
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
at first glance seem scattershot...
random.

101
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,600
But since history is cause and effect
I decided to do a little experiment.

102
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,000
{\an5}I folded a linear timeline
onto itself

103
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,960
{\an5}following the mathematics
of the golden ratio.

104
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,120
Follow me.

105
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,200
{\an5}Damn it, Gideon. That was your cue.

106
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,080
<i>My apologies, Dr. Heywood.</i>

107
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,920
Oh, see, the anachronisms
form a pattern.

108
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Should have guessed.

109
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,800
{\an5}Though time may be broken, like
all matter in the known universe,

110
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,200
{\an5}it still possesses
a mathematical harmony.

111
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,640
Not exactly. Uh...

112
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,320
What about those two?

113
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,840
Those two are outliers.
The first one is Seattle, 2042.

114
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,080
- When the assassin tried to kill me.
- Right.

115
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,840
While cool... not the part where,
you know, you almost got killed.

116
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,720
It's not as cool as the other one.

117
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,040
London, 1895.

118
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,560
How do I say this? There's a vampire.

119
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,080
Half dozen men snatched
off the streets

120
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,440
only to have their bodies
dumped three days later

121
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:44,640
completely drained of blood.

122
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,920
Vampires.

123
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,280
Waited my whole life to kill one.

124
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,480
Do you just carry that around
all the time?

125
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,640
My whole life.

126
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,680
There's no such thing as vampires.

127
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,560
Increased immigration
at the <i>fin de siècle</i>

128
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,600
and the fear that good English
women would lose their virtue

129
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,440
to foreign predators is responsible
for these ludicrous stories.

130
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,080
I say we go see what's so interesting
about this anachronism.

131
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,120
{\an5}Victorian London.
Opium dens and low-cut corsets.

132
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,800
{\an5}Arthur Conan Doyle
and the rolling fog.

133
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,880
Syphilis, whores, and vampires.

134
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,400
{\an5}There's a strong smell of garlic.

135
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,040
It's tied around my neck.

136
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,000
{\an5}Yep, you're a regular Van Helsing.

137
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,160
{\an5}That's from Dracula.

138
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,880
I'm reading it.
Don't tell me the end.

139
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,480
Another vampire victim
found dead in the street.

140
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,640
Oy, give me that.

141
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,960
{\an5}Whoa, vampires?
What the hell is he talking about?

142
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,680
{\an5}The blood-sucking creatures
that we're here hunting.

143
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,440
Oh, no. Short-term memory loss.

144
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,840
One of the side effects of the serum.

145
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:46,480
Come on.

146
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,560
- Who are you lot?
- Oy, Scotland Yard.

147
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,520
We're here to see about these
so-called vampire attacks.

148
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,080
And we're with the NYPD.

149
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,760
Nothing like a bit of cooperation
from across the pond, right?

150
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,480
- Right.
- This one of the victims?

151
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,520
Unlucky devil.

152
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,920
Whoa, whoa, Mick!

153
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,680
You don't want him coming back
to life, do you?

154
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,360
What's going on here?

155
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,200
Scotland Yard has
already visited twice,

156
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,080
and if the NYPD is issuing
ladies warrant cards,

157
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,360
then I'm the bloody Queen.

158
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,240
All right, who brought their phone?

159
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,560
Wasn't me, even though
I do love that song.

160
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,200
That's not a phone.

161
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,720
That's a 2016 Palmer Tech 7G
smart watch.

162
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,320
Hand it over.

163
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,160
I don't know what you're on about.

164
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,600
You want some of this?

165
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,480
Who does that watch belong to?

166
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,000
No? All right. Mick, stake him.

167
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,200
Oh, all right. All right.

168
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,360
A vicar was walking down the street
as calm as can be

169
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,600
when a dead man fell from the sky.

170
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,680
It wasn't no normal corpse, neither.

171
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,160
No identification, strange clothes,
and that there watch.

172
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,520
Which you stole.

173
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,640
He wasn't gonna miss it.
I will, though.

174
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,840
It is the finest timepiece
I've ever seen.

175
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,360
It did sell better in England.

176
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,840
So, where's our John Doe, now?

177
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,520
Well, I buried him in Stone's Hollow.

178
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,120
And the next day,

179
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,680
the first vampire victim
was snatched from the street.

180
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,440
Because that corpse you buried
was a vampire from the future,

181
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,520
you idiot.

182
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,720
All right, time to go.

183
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,880
Who are you lot?

184
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,200
Tonight, we're grave diggers.

185
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,280
All right, we're looking for one
unmarked grave among hundreds.

186
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,480
I say we split up.
Check them row by row.

187
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,240
Or we can start with the one
that's already dug up.

188
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,320
Yes.

189
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,600
Ah, the vampire must've dug himself
out before nightfall.

190
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,800
Damn it, that anachronistic
corpse was our only lead.

191
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,720
Wait, wait, did you hear that?

192
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,240
Kill it, kill it, kill it!

193
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,880
- Rip.
- Rip?

194
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,840
- Welcome to London.
- Listen, Englishman.

195
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,760
Those time pigs try to take me,
I'll burn them alive.

196
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,280
The Time Bureau are not actually
aware of my current whereabouts.

197
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,520
And as surprising
as this may sound...

198
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,240
I need the Legends' help.

199
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,920
Miss Jiwe. I was surprised to hear
that you'd rejoined the team.

200
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,440
It's surprising to me too.

201
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,720
I trust we're not under arrest?

202
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,840
Far from it.

203
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,920
Rip?

204
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,400
What... Rip, where the hell
did you come from?

205
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,480
Where'd he come from?

206
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,600
What... where... where do any
of us come from?

207
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,480
You know, what are the odds of that

208
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,040
one lonely sperm meeting with
that one special egg?

209
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,680
You know us science types are always

210
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,560
still wrestling with the big
questions.

211
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,960
We've answered those questions,
Dr. Palmer.

212
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,640
I need Jax's help... with this.

213
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,160
There's some GPS data on here,

214
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,960
and it might be able to tell us
where our dead man walking came from,

215
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,160
and where he's going. Or her.

216
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,280
So, yep.

217
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,160
Oh, man, the short-term memory
loss is worse than I anticipated.

218
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,520
Marty's definitely gonna notice.

219
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,360
It's okay. I got this.

220
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,040
I... I'll just write myself a note.
Like, Rip's back.

221
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,680
Excuse me, what's going on?

222
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,200
What? Nothing, man.

223
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:35,720
You're acting awfully strange.

224
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,360
- Oh, it's a... Temporal dysplasia.
- Temporal dysplasia.

225
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,000
You know... you know how that is.

226
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,800
- Lily.
<i>- Dad.</i>

227
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,920
Is everything all right?

228
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,120
<i>Ronnie won't sleep.</i>

229
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,960
<i>Your lullabies are
the only thing that work.</i>

230
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,960
All right. Excuse me. Priorities.

231
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,760
All right, little guy.
It's time for you to go to sleep.

232
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,600
<i>Hush little Ronnie</i>

233
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,320
<i>Don't say a word</i>

234
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,120
- Come on, man.
- All right.

235
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,560
We'll continue with the plan.

236
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,440
But not until we figure out
whose watch this is.

237
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,760
Which could be difficult.

238
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,800
<i>Digital Digest</i>gave my software
encryption a five padlock rating.

239
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,240
Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.

240
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,080
I... I didn't realize
that you were praying.

241
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,160
Mecca's that way.
I was just looking for my earring.

242
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,920
I wanted to talk to you about before.

243
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,600
I know that it's tough.

244
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,840
That I'm not allowed
to save my family?

245
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,360
Yeah, it's real tough.

246
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,440
You should take comfort

247
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,680
that your brother wanted you
to have that totem.

248
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,720
You reclaimed it.

249
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,120
It's your birthright.
It's your family's...

250
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,720
Hey, stop talking about my
family when you're telling me

251
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,000
I can't save them.

252
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,320
What the hell was that?

253
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,440
This is the reason I asked you
to stay aboard the ship.

254
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,360
The reason that I haven't
returned home.

255
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,360
We're connected.

256
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,200
What for?

257
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:00,840
I don't know.

258
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,200
I was hoping that we could find
that answer together.

259
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,480
Not to be...

260
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,680
overly sentimental, but...

261
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,960
I've missed this place.

262
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:20,680
We'd love to reminisce with you,
but your Time Bureau's on our tail.

263
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,720
Makes us slow to help you out.

264
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,360
I'll get down to it, then.

265
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,240
When I permitted the Legends to keep
the Waverider...

266
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,040
Nobody permits us to do anything.

267
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,440
I had an ulterior motive.

268
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,320
Why does that not surprise me?

269
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,760
For the last five years,
I've been chasing a phantom.

270
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:40,760
A name whispered across time
and in every language.

271
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,200
Mallus.

272
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,360
The Phantom Mollusk?
An evil shellfish?

273
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,640
"Mall-us."

274
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,040
An evil so ancient and powerful

275
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,680
that the Time Masters
dared not speak his name.

276
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,640
Now, I believe that
he is recruiting allies

277
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,680
from throughout time to his cause.

278
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,440
Now, anachronisms are the result
of your breaking time.

279
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,720
It was her idea.

280
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,240
But these outliers, they are most
certainly the work of Mallus.

281
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,040
Now, the Time Bureau is a bureaucracy

282
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,200
and lacks the imagination
to understand this particular threat.

283
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,760
And Director Bennett objects
to my crusade.

284
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,200
I'm alone out here.

285
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,480
So what I'm hearing is, your hot
new girlfriend dumped you,

286
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,280
and now you're crawling back
to your ex.

287
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,920
And I'm no one's side piece.

288
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,240
You know, I think
they're onto something here.

289
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,960
Look, sweetie.

290
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,800
We would love to take you back,

291
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,280
but we don't know
how we could trust you again.

292
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,040
Would circumstances
be any different

293
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,240
if I were to call off my hot
new girlfriend's pursuit of you?

294
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,520
Deal.

295
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,000
All right, what's your plan?

296
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,400
Right, this outlier... the...

297
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,880
the vampire is most likely
the objective of Mallus.

298
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:11,280
Catch the vampire, catch Mallus.

299
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,400
Sounds like we're gonna need
vampire bait.

300
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,320
Me?

301
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,240
Is it because I'm handsome?

302
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,600
Pretty.

303
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,800
Pretty handsome.

304
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,200
Overcrowding and poverty
made Whitechapel

305
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,080
a breeding ground
for criminal activity,

306
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,280
culminating in the Ripper's
murders right around...

307
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,600
well, now.

308
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,680
Isn't history fascinating?

309
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,320
It certainly is.

310
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,040
Trusting the Englishman
was a damn mistake.

311
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,200
You know we're all on comms,
don't you, Mr. Rory?

312
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,160
I don't give a rat's ass.

313
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,400
No sign of any vampires.

314
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,480
I wish this was like
a Kristen Stewart type,

315
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,520
all broody and sparkly.

316
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,480
Vampires don't sparkle.

317
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,400
You know, Mick, you and the vamp
have a lot in common.

318
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,640
You both like to sleep in,
and, you know...

319
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,720
kill people.

320
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,920
Stein? What are you doing out here?

321
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,360
Looking for you, dear boy.

322
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,120
Nate.

323
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,640
Nate?

324
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,040
We seem to have lost Dr. Heywood.

325
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,400
Nate, answer me.

326
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,280
Look.

327
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,960
He's got Dr. Heywood.

328
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,040
Let's cut him off.

329
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:02,000
Well, that was invigorating.

330
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,840
<i>You find Pretty?</i>

331
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,760
No, we lost him.

332
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,120
We found potatoes.

333
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,640
Never fear. The game's afoot.

334
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,080
Me thought I heard a voice cry,
Sleep no more!

335
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,400
Professor Stein?

336
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,120
No. Shakespeare, actually.

337
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,120
And it's Sir Stein to you.

338
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,080
It's not every actor who is knighted.

339
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,320
Oh, God. This can't be happening.

340
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,360
Thanks to your lifeblood,

341
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,680
my master will finally make
his return.

342
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,960
But there's much to be done
in the meantime.

343
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,600
Yeah, well, that wasn't creepy.

344
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,240
<i>Sara?</i>

345
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,720
Nate, where are you?

346
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,880
<i>I don't know.</i>

347
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:17,000
But I just had a chat with Professor
Stein's weird lookalike evil cousin.

348
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,440
<i>Great-great grandfather,
to be exact.</i>

349
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,560
{\an5}<i>The famous stage actor,
Sir Henry Stein.</i>

350
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,680
Astonishing.

351
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,720
The... the chances of us running
into one of my ancestors are...

352
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,960
astronomical.

353
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,320
Family lore recalls him
as being an eccentric.

354
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,880
But then, what can one expect
from an actor?

355
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,760
He's also an occult weirdo
who kidnapped me to feed his master.

356
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,200
Excellent.
The vampire will lead us to Mallus.

357
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,680
Stay where you are, Dr. Heywood.

358
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,000
Yeah, that's not gonna be a problem.

359
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,600
Whatever they roofied me
with fritzed out my powers.

360
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,760
<i>Can you describe where you are?</i>

361
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,240
Uh, like a...

362
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,640
an operating room?

363
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,000
All I know is there's a spooky-ass
red moon painting on the wall.

364
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,880
- What's that?
- It's...

365
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,520
It's some of my research on Mallus.

366
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,280
<i>Beware the blood-red moon,</i>

367
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,520
<i>when the door that separates
death from life will be opened.</i>

368
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,360
It's the first line of an oath

369
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,120
taken by the Order
of the Shrouded Compass,

370
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,160
an infamous secret society
of London's aristocracy

371
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,080
obsessed with the occult.

372
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,400
That sounds like the perfect place

373
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,800
for an out-of-time vampire
to take refuge.

374
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,880
Yes, well, the Order also believe
in the magical properties

375
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,400
associated with...

376
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,880
a total lunar eclipse.

377
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,800
Which is set to occur right here
in London tonight.

378
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,240
If I wasn't vampire hunting,
I'd rob these rich bastards blind.

379
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,800
Hunting a tiger for sport is...
is just perverse.

380
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,680
I can't believe we're in a time
where women can't vote

381
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,240
and the Internet's not a thing.

382
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,480
Savages.

383
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,880
Anyone who doesn't have
a reflection,

384
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,600
they're getting a stake.

385
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,400
Ladies and gentlemen, if I could
have your attention, please.

386
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,040
Truly uncanny.

387
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,640
It's that 'stache that's astonishing.

388
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,680
I know you're not here
for idle chitchat and aperitifs.

389
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,200
So please allow me to introduce
the star of the evening,

390
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,960
a famed mystic who has come
all the way from America

391
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,520
to communicate with the dead.

392
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,360
Madame Eleanor.

393
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,720
Can't believe people
are buying this garbage.

394
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,400
I sense...

395
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:50,120
someone in the room who longs
to speak to a departed loved one.

396
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,080
Come.

397
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,720
Sit at my table, if you have no fear.

398
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,800
Since we can't hack the watch
for its GPS data,

399
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,920
we're gonna have to solve
this one the old-fashioned way.

400
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,440
With fingerprints.

401
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,000
Okay, we got the coroner's
fingerprints.

402
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,800
And the second one is mine,
obviously,

403
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,720
and the third one is unidentifiable,

404
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,320
and the fourth one is...

405
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,640
Oliver Queen?

406
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,800
Oliver's a time-traveling vampire
from the future?

407
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,320
We got to call Team Arrow,
figure out what the heck's going on.

408
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,600
<i>Return of the Mack</i>

409
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,480
<i>Pump up the world</i>

410
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,480
<i>Return of the Mack</i>

411
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,600
<i>Watch my flow</i>

412
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,320
<i>Return of the Mack you know...</i>

413
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,800
About time.

414
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,920
I'm as excited as you are.

415
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,720
But we all must wait
for the blood-red moon

416
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,960
before the ceremony may begin.

417
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,360
Oh, gross.

418
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,720
If you need me, I'll be, um...

419
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,880
I'll be right over here.

420
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,120
Sara, I could really use a rescue
right now.

421
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,480
We're working on it.

422
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,600
Do you remember our mission
from the Greyhill Building?

423
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,320
Like it was yesterday.

424
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,320
Oh, excuse me.

425
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,440
Could you tell me
where the powder room is?

426
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,560
Oh!

427
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,760
Oh, I've missed this.

428
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,560
Everyone, please join hands.

429
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,640
There is a doubter among us.

430
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,600
I, too, was a skeptic once,

431
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,520
before the spirits spoke to me.

432
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,040
But now I am their conduit.

433
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,680
<i>Khaahar.</i>

434
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,840
<i>Do you remember the night
they came for us?</i>

435
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,280
<i>How fast you ran?</i>

436
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,800
<i>You abandoned me, Khaahar.</i>

437
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,200
<i>You let them kill me
so you could live.</i>

438
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,880
No.

439
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,200
<i>You are scared now.</i>

440
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,960
<i>Just as you were scared
of A.R.G.U.S. then.</i>

441
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,800
<i>So much fear.</i>

442
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,640
<i>You were my big sister.</i>

443
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,120
<i>You should have protected me.</i>

444
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,240
- Please.
- Stop this at once.

445
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,560
You heard the lady.

446
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,520
<i>Sara, our cover is blown.</i>

447
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,600
<i>We need to leave.</i>

448
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,920
Wait, the vampire, that was you?

449
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,400
A two-pronged needle by my own
invention is hardly vampiric.

450
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,760
Then who's the stiff?

451
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,720
Nate, are you okay?

452
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,080
Does it look like I'm okay?

453
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,440
Instead of a sexy vampire,
I got stuck with this weirdo.

454
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,440
He's all yours.

455
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,800
The Order has plans
for our time-displaced corpse.

456
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,000
That's why they're kidnapping men
and draining their blood.

457
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,720
It's for their ceremony.

458
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,160
Shall we find out who it is?

459
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,560
<i>Whoa, guys, I am digging the digs.</i>

460
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,520
<i>I mean, I have some serious lab
envy over here.</i>

461
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,840
Yeah? Well, check this out.

462
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:47,640
<i>Whoa, okay, wow.</i>

463
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,200
<i>Well, I've analyzed
that unidentified print</i>

464
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,400
<i>and got back 100,000
possible variations</i>

465
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,800
<i>on a complete friction ridge.</i>

466
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,680
Okay, so, do we have a match?

467
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,360
<i>Unfortunately. I hope you
guys have a bar on that ship,</i>

468
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,640
<i>because you're gonna need a drink.</i>

469
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,520
<i>The watch belongs to...</i>

470
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,320
Damien Darhk.

471
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,040
Darhk must be integral
to Mallus' plan.

472
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,600
We can't leave Damien Darhk's
body to be resurrected.

473
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,080
Darhk may be a madman,

474
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,400
but he's not the madman
we're presently after.

475
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,120
Guys, we have definitely
overstayed our welcome.

476
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,440
Fall back.

477
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,920
The hell is going on?

478
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,920
We're not killing vampires anymore?

479
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,440
Captain Lance, need I remind you

480
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,040
we are no longer just fixing
ordinary anachronisms here.

481
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,800
Mallus is the only game that matters.

482
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,240
No, it's your game.

483
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,560
We have to stop Damien Darhk
from coming back to life.

484
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,680
And we will.

485
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,160
But from all indications,

486
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,440
Mallus is coming here
to recruit Darhk.

487
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,760
If we destroy Darhk's body,

488
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,520
we destroy any chance
of apprehending Mallus

489
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,720
at the resurrection ceremony.

490
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,000
If Sara says kill Darhk,
or re-kill Darhk,

491
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,360
or Prop him up in a convertible
like Weekend at Bernie's,

492
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,720
that's what we do,
because she's the captain.

493
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,800
I know that you all want to destroy
Darhk, once and for all.

494
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,800
You're just gonna have to be patient.

495
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,280
I'd like to speak to you in private.

496
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,120
Good luck in there.

497
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,920
I'm not letting Damien Darhk
come back to life.

498
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,800
Full stop.

499
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,400
You've lost perspective.

500
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,080
You're letting personal
prejudice cloud your judgment.

501
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:31,560
If I had, I wouldn't have put
Damien Darhk back into the timeline

502
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,680
and erased his memory,

503
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,360
so that he could kill my sister.

504
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,680
Again.

505
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,040
Look, Sara.

506
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,200
I understand how perilous it would be
for Mr. Darhk to return.

507
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,400
Do you?

508
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,120
Because I'm the only one in this
room that's been resurrected,

509
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,040
and it wasn't an improvement.

510
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,400
All right.

511
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,920
You're right.

512
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,440
You've got to understand, Sara,

513
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:01,160
that I... I've been chasing Mallus
for so long that...

514
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,000
perhaps,
it is I who's lost perspective.

515
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,080
Never gonna learn how to knock,
are you?

516
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,960
I'm concerned about you.

517
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,280
I know that you think that
woman channeled your brother.

518
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,040
His name was Behrad.

519
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,680
The night A.R.G.U.S. came for
us, I ran.

520
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,880
I knew he was staying to fight,
but I was scared.

521
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,240
I left my brother there to die.

522
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,640
You happy?

523
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,680
Now you know my secret.

524
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,600
- Sorry.
- You know, I don't...

525
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,120
I don't want this anymore.

526
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,200
Whatever's going on with it
or with us,

527
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,840
I... I... I don't care.

528
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,200
That totem is your only remaining
connection to him.

529
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:01,240
It's not a connection.
It's a reminder...

530
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,680
that I should have been
the one who died.

531
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,520
You know...

532
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,400
it's kind of weird not being able
to sense Stein's emotions.

533
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,640
Don't tell me you're missing
your psychic connection.

534
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,960
Oh, come on. Of course not.

535
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,840
- Well, maybe a little, but...
- Aha!

536
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,040
I've uncovered your ruse.

537
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,840
- You've been using my lab...
- Your lab?

538
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,880
To impede our psychic connection.

539
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,440
It's the very foundation
of Firestorm.

540
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,520
Actually, that's...

541
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,320
that's the foundation of Firestorm.

542
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:39,200
It... it's the formulae for building
a thermocore.

543
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,760
No, I was playing hangman.

544
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,880
Q!

545
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,000
Q...

546
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,040
Grey, don't take this out on Ray.

547
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,280
He was just helping me figure
out a way we could...

548
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,320
break up Firestorm.

549
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,520
So that you could go home,
and I could stay on the ship.

550
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,920
Oh, I see.

551
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,120
So are you cool with this?

552
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,720
Why wouldn't I be?

553
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,720
After all, you've only been...
been here tinkering in secret

554
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,120
with how to split up a walking,
talking, living nuclear reactor.

555
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,480
- Of course I'm cool with it.
- Okay.

556
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,400
After everything we've been through,

557
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,120
how could you attempt something
of this magnitude behind my back?

558
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,240
Grey, it's not like...

559
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,600
Oh, it seems we both share
a craving for solitude.

560
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,040
Is everyone aboard the ship?

561
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,200
As far as I'm aware.

562
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,400
Is there something I can do for you?

563
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,120
In fact, there is.

564
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,600
If you'd please tell
Captain Lance that...

565
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,640
I'm sorry.

566
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,480
What are you doing?

567
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:48,040
Gideon, initiate
Gentleman's Dreadnought.

568
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:51,360
<i>Command code recognized.
Are you sure, Director Hunter?</i>

569
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,960
She left me no choice.

570
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,120
<i>Seven, six, five...</i>

571
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,200
- Gideon!
<i>- Four, three, two...</i>

572
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,480
- It's Mr. Hunter.
<i>- One.</i>

573
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,560
What's he done?

574
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,840
All the exits are locked.

575
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,600
And I can't override the command.

576
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,880
Damn it, Rip.

577
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,440
Told you we should never
have trusted the Englishman.

578
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,960
Where's Zari?

579
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,240
Come in.

580
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,920
I was hoping we might meet again.

581
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,560
You channeled my brother earlier.
I need to talk to him again.

582
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,920
Well, I'm sorry.

583
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,600
I cannot merely summon
the dead at whim.

584
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,840
Please, I need to tell him
that I'm sorry.

585
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,800
And I have a way to bring him back.

586
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,160
I can save him this time.

587
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,760
I could try.

588
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,120
I would need a memento,
something that belonged to him

589
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,080
that I could focus my energy on.

590
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,680
Would this work?

591
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,040
So much power.

592
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,600
And you give it away so easily.

593
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,000
A mistake you're unlikely to repeat.

594
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,880
Madame Eleanor.
The blood-red moon beckons.

595
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,960
Restrain her.

596
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,320
I must prepare for the ceremony.

597
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,280
Damn, Gideon, how many secret
commands did Rip program you with?

598
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,320
<i>I believe this was the last
of them, Captain.</i>

599
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,440
Well, I'm captain now,

600
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,640
and I order you
to override Rip's orders

601
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,360
and ready the ship for takeoff.

602
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,000
<i>Right away, Captain Lance.</i>

603
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,480
<i>Director Hunter's command
allows you to fly the Waverider,</i>

604
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,960
<i>just not let any of you off of it.</i>

605
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,560
Well, it's a start.

606
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,360
Plot a course
for the Shrouded Compass.

607
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,720
Damn right, Cap-i-tan.

608
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,200
And bring the ship's
weapon system online.

609
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,280
Needless to say, it's highly likely
that Mr. Hunter is in that building.

610
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,120
And I'm willing to bet that
so is Zari.

611
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,360
You want an omelet,
you got to crack a few eggs.

612
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,320
When you welcomed me
to the Order,

613
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,520
you were seeking proof.

614
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:40,240
Evidence that life does not
have to end with death.

615
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,040
But the power that courses
through my veins is not mine own.

616
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,640
It is a gift.

617
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,560
From Mallus.

618
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,160
Stop this abomination!

619
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,320
<i>- Turn around! You, turn around!
- Everybody down, now!</i>

620
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,600
<i>Come on, right now!</i>

621
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:13,280
Your so-called master, where is he?

622
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,920
Mallus is everywhere and nowhere,
refracted in every moment of time.

623
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,000
He is dead.

624
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,760
He is risen.

625
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,800
And he will come again.

626
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,200
Right, well, that's very cryptic.

627
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,360
But I demand to speak to him.

628
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,120
Oh. Well, very well.

629
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,960
Director Hunter.

630
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,200
A pleasure to meet you.

631
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,760
Oh, I'm not here to speak
to your puppet.

632
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,080
I think it's about time
you and I met face-to-face.

633
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,800
You cannot look upon
my true form and live.

634
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:04,160
While you are hopelessly mortal,
I am a God.

635
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,360
You're too late.

636
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,640
It's good to be back.

637
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,080
Who stole my watch?

638
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,480
Our coordinates say
we're right above the Order.

639
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,000
- Prepare the shock-missiles.
- Three pages left.

640
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,240
What are you doing? Zari's in there.

641
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,920
I need you to target the cargo bay.

642
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,360
What? Our cargo bay?

643
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,000
Shouldn't we have a team vote first?

644
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,160
If anybody has a better idea
how to get the ship open,

645
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,280
now's the time.

646
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,280
Trust me, Jax. Fire.

647
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,200
<i>Shock-missiles away, Captain.</i>

648
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,800
Oh, this is gonna suck so bad.

649
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,680
Grey, if we're gonna die,

650
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,080
I don't want us to go out
mad at each other.

651
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,280
So, I can't remember what for,
but I'm sorry.

652
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,880
You were just thinking of me.

653
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,840
Actually,
I... I should be thanking you.

654
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,400
Who wants to hold hands?

655
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,280
Ray, it's not freaking <i>Toy Story 3.</i>

656
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,480
Everyone shut up.
I got one page left.

657
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,720
<i>Oh</i>

658
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:49,080
<i>Come on</i>

659
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,040
<i>Yeah</i>

660
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:55,480
<i>Well I tried to tell you so yes I did</i>

661
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,960
<i>But I guess you didn't know</i>

662
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,920
<i>As I said the story goes</i>

663
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,920
<i>Return of the Mack</i>

664
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,160
<i>Return of the Mack come on</i>

665
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,440
<i>Return of the Mack</i>

666
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,720
<i>Oh my God</i>

667
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,240
<i>You know that I'll be back here I am</i>

668
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,400
<i>Return of the Mack once again</i>

669
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,920
<i>Return of the Mack pump up the world</i>

670
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,840
<i>Return of the Mack watch my flow</i>

671
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,360
Any last words, Rip?

672
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,680
Yes, I remember you.

673
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,840
I remember everything.

674
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,440
Remember us?

675
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,120
Oh, goodie. More Legends.

676
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,800
Here to kill me, I assume.

677
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,440
This time it'll stick.

678
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,480
That's my totem.

679
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,440
Let's go.

680
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,720
Till we meet again.

681
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,760
Not bad. A little tart.

682
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,000
If you can believe it,

683
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,840
Clarissa prefers to eat her
grapefruit...

684
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,840
With salt. Yeah, I remember.

685
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,240
How?

686
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,200
I got Ray to restore
our psychic connection.

687
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,120
I can feel how much
you're missing your family.

688
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,760
Ever since baby Ronnie was born,
it's only gotten worse.

689
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,520
It's like there's a hole in my chest.

690
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,600
I'm so sorry.

691
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,840
I never expected the birth
of my grandson

692
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,960
would make being away
that much more painful.

693
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,560
And I certainly never wanted you
to share this burden.

694
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:46,880
But with this new Mallus threat,
and the return of Damien Darhk,

695
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,760
the team needs Firestorm
more than ever.

696
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:52,680
Yeah, and the team can get Firestorm,
and you can go home,

697
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:56,200
if we can stabilize the Matrix
into my body.

698
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,480
T.S. Eliot once said,

699
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,440
<i>Only those who risk going too far</i>

700
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,720
<i>can possibly find out
how far one can go.</i>

701
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,960
So, when do we start?

702
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,000
As soon as I fix that giant hole
in the cargo bay.

703
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,440
- Well, good luck with that.
- Yeah.

704
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,480
Yeah.

705
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,480
Knock, knock.

706
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,760
Still not knocking.

707
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,320
You want to sit?

708
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,720
Sure. Thanks.

709
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,840
This is gonna sound weird, but...

710
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,360
when my amulet came back to me,

711
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,040
I felt Behrad's presence.

712
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,400
Like, almost like he was with me.

713
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,520
That doesn't sound weird at all.

714
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:56,200
God, first A.R.G.U.S.,
then that Water Witch.

715
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,480
And now some formerly dead guy
all want to kill me.

716
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:02,760
My ancestor told me
that the totems' strength grows

717
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,400
when the threats we face
become more powerful.

718
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,840
Fantastic.

719
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,840
I think what she meant is that

720
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,120
you and I are gonna
become great friends.

721
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:17,440
And we'll defeat whatever evil comes,
together.

722
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,600
I like that.

723
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,560
We need to talk.

724
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,400
By now you know me better
than to expect an apology.

725
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,640
Agents are dead because of you.

726
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,200
They understood the risks
of their profession.

727
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,560
But we learned so much
from the events of last night.

728
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:48,560
- Next time...
- There won't be a next time, Rip.

729
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,200
You show up out of nowhere
practically begging for our help,

730
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,800
and then you betray us.

731
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,480
You've gone rogue
from every organization

732
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,840
that you've ever been a part of.

733
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,680
Because you don't trust anyone.

734
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:03,440
I don't know how I could have
ever trusted you.

735
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,720
Sara, I need you with me
now more than ever.

736
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,720
Do you remember when you told me
you had nothing left to teach me?

737
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,280
I guess you had one final lesson.

738
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,160
How to be a cold son of a bitch.

739
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,040
Director Bennett.

740
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,680
Director Hunter.

741
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,200
You've called in your last chit.

742
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,080
I should never have sanctioned
last night's mission.

743
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,080
But the mission proved
that Mallus is real.

744
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,040
Explain it to the tribunal.

745
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,920
In the meantime,
you are being detained

746
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
and suspended from active duty.

747
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,240
You can't detain me. I...

748
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,760
I created the Bureau.

749
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:46,000
Then you of all people should know
that no one is exempt from its rules.

750
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,880
Agent Sharpe.

751
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,760
Thank you for notifying us
of Director Hunter's whereabouts.

752
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,960
Now the Legends are free
to fly the skies?

753
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,080
Affirmative.

754
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,560
The Time Bureau has bigger things
to worry about

755
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,840
than a bunch of idiots.

756
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,600
Mallus is getting stronger,
Captain Lance.

757
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,080
Last night was only the beginning.

758
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,720
There is a war coming.

759
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,640
And history needs you to be ready.

760
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,480
You and the rest of the Legends.
