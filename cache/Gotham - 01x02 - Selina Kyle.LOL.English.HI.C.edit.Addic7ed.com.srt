<i>OSWALD: There's a war coming... a terrible war.</i>

2
00:00:03,963 --> 00:00:06,698
<i>There will be chaos. Rivers
of blood in the streets.</i>

3
00:00:06,732 --> 00:00:09,354
I know it. I can see it coming.

4
00:00:09,369 --> 00:00:11,339
<i>MOONEY: It's time.
Somebody has to take over.</i>

5
00:00:11,386 --> 00:00:13,005
It might as well be me.

6
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:14,873
(screams)

7
00:00:14,907 --> 00:00:16,674
<i>My name's James Gordon. I'm a detective.</i>

8
00:00:16,709 --> 00:00:18,476
<i>- My name is Bruce Wayne.
- I promise I will</i>

9
00:00:18,511 --> 00:00:19,677
find the man who did this.

10
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:21,279
Stop or I'll shoot!

11
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:22,280
(gunshot)

12
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:25,183
<i>He was framed... to cover
up for the real killer.</i>

13
00:00:25,217 --> 00:00:27,142
I know that you own the police department.

14
00:00:27,154 --> 00:00:28,172
Probably the mayor.

15
00:00:28,197 --> 00:00:30,855
You can't have organized
crime without law and order.

16
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,357
You snitched,

17
00:00:32,391 --> 00:00:34,259
my little penguin.

18
00:00:34,293 --> 00:00:35,894
Please!

19
00:00:35,928 --> 00:00:37,529
Falcone wants you to
put a bullet in his head.

20
00:00:37,563 --> 00:00:39,230
<i>Then everybody knows
you're with the program.</i>

21
00:00:39,265 --> 00:00:41,232
Don't ever come back to Gotham.

22
00:00:41,267 --> 00:00:43,435
(gunshot)

23
00:00:56,282 --> 00:00:58,550
(hissing softly)

24
00:01:03,589 --> 00:01:06,217
Ah, there you are.

25
00:01:07,185 --> 00:01:09,196
Been all over the bloody
house looking for you.

26
00:01:13,132 --> 00:01:14,733
What are you doing?

27
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:16,368
Nothing.

28
00:01:16,402 --> 00:01:19,371
You, my old son, are a terrible liar.

29
00:01:19,405 --> 00:01:21,239
What have you got there?

30
00:01:23,142 --> 00:01:24,743
Come on. Show me.

31
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:32,684
Oh, my God, you stupid little boy!

32
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:35,020
Oh.

33
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:37,122
It's all right. I'm sorry.

34
00:01:37,156 --> 00:01:39,290
It's gonna be all right.

35
00:01:42,628 --> 00:01:44,629
(indistinct chatter)

36
00:01:59,612 --> 00:02:02,147
(horn honking)

37
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:09,988
Hi! I'm Patti.

38
00:02:10,022 --> 00:02:11,256
This is Doug.

39
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,591
We're with the mayor's
Homeless Outreach Project.

40
00:02:13,626 --> 00:02:15,527
We have some sandwiches and some soup.

41
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:18,163
We got cookies, got candy.
Who here likes chocolate?

42
00:02:20,299 --> 00:02:22,534
(chuckles) Ain't you hungry, Cat?

43
00:02:24,103 --> 00:02:26,004
Yeah, dig in. Take a sandwich.

44
00:02:26,038 --> 00:02:28,607
- This is what I need.
- Sure, go ahead.

45
00:02:28,641 --> 00:02:30,542
Plenty for everyone.

46
00:02:30,576 --> 00:02:32,711
Yeah, sure. Take two.

47
00:02:37,316 --> 00:02:38,416
Hey!

48
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:39,451
Hey, lady.

49
00:02:45,491 --> 00:02:47,459
Oh, fudge!

50
00:02:47,493 --> 00:02:48,560
Don't worry. I'll go.

51
00:02:48,594 --> 00:02:49,995
(sighs)

52
00:02:50,029 --> 00:02:52,030
Slow down there, buckaroo.

53
00:02:53,399 --> 00:02:55,367
(indistinct chatter)

54
00:02:55,401 --> 00:02:57,302
(grunting)

55
00:02:57,336 --> 00:03:00,038
(screaming)

56
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,488
I got you one, but I dropped it.

57
00:03:45,522 --> 00:03:47,590
Yeah, thanks.

58
00:03:47,624 --> 00:03:50,359
- Where is everybody?
- I don't know.

59
00:03:50,394 --> 00:03:51,828
What do you think?

60
00:03:51,862 --> 00:03:54,297
I think it's been a long shift.
We give this bum three hours,

61
00:03:54,331 --> 00:03:56,132
then we knock off. (siren chirps)

62
00:03:56,166 --> 00:03:57,300
He was a vet.

63
00:03:57,334 --> 00:03:59,502
I salute his service. Now he's a dead bum.

64
00:03:59,536 --> 00:04:01,037
People are shooting bums

65
00:04:01,071 --> 00:04:03,773
all the time. We might as well
be looking for the tooth fairy.

66
00:04:03,807 --> 00:04:05,842
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Bo.

67
00:04:05,876 --> 00:04:08,144
How come you weren't here?

68
00:04:08,178 --> 00:04:10,313
Whoa, whoa. Good morning to you, too.

69
00:04:10,347 --> 00:04:12,415
- Where were you?
- I was at a restaurant down the street here,

70
00:04:12,449 --> 00:04:15,051
Chez Vous. They had
some homeless junkie kid,

71
00:04:15,085 --> 00:04:17,420
fell through their front window last night.

72
00:04:17,454 --> 00:04:19,655
- I been taking care of that.
- This is a potential murder.

73
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:21,157
You're first responder.

74
00:04:21,191 --> 00:04:23,159
You're supposed to preserve the
integrity of the crime scene.

75
00:04:23,193 --> 00:04:24,861
- He's got a point.
- Well,

76
00:04:24,895 --> 00:04:27,730
the restaurant that pays me $50
a month to look out for them.

77
00:04:27,764 --> 00:04:31,167
So I'm gonna babysit a
dead wino? I got a family.

78
00:04:31,201 --> 00:04:32,635
He's got a point.

79
00:04:33,737 --> 00:04:35,338
Why'd the kid jump through the window?

80
00:04:35,372 --> 00:04:36,806
Who knows? He was high.

81
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,975
- Did you ask him?
- Why am I the bad guy here?

82
00:04:39,009 --> 00:04:41,911
I'm asking about the kid because
maybe he's related to the victim.

83
00:04:41,945 --> 00:04:44,347
And you're not a bad guy...
you're just a bad cop.

84
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:45,481
Whoa. Who you talking to?

85
00:04:45,516 --> 00:04:46,916
- You know, I already had...
- Hold on.

86
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,719
- Come on. Come on!
- You want it? Any day!

87
00:04:49,753 --> 00:04:51,621
Hey! Whoa!

88
00:04:55,392 --> 00:04:57,360
<i>BOY: And then Zeb and
Smoke went right down,</i>

89
00:04:57,394 --> 00:05:00,530
and that's when that wacky
dude just shot Soldier.

90
00:05:00,564 --> 00:05:02,365
That's when I realized I
needed to get out of there.

91
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:03,833
So I ran and I ran, and that's how

92
00:05:03,867 --> 00:05:05,735
I ended up on the floor of that restaurant.

93
00:05:06,603 --> 00:05:07,937
She used a pin.

94
00:05:07,971 --> 00:05:09,939
I swear. A big pin.

95
00:05:09,973 --> 00:05:12,475
But, listen, this is not the first time.

96
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:15,378
Street kids have been
disappearing for weeks now.

97
00:05:15,412 --> 00:05:17,280
By the dozen. No one knows why.

98
00:05:17,314 --> 00:05:19,749
- First we heard about it.
- Why-y would you?

99
00:05:19,783 --> 00:05:22,018
Nobody gives a crap about us.

100
00:05:22,052 --> 00:05:23,486
I mean, look! That is proof!

101
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,022
That's not proof. That's
a scab. Now, listen, Macky,

102
00:05:26,056 --> 00:05:27,857
we're grown-ups. We're smarter than you.

103
00:05:27,891 --> 00:05:29,959
So you're gonna... you're
gonna tell me the truth!

104
00:05:29,993 --> 00:05:31,227
It was you, wasn't it?

105
00:05:31,261 --> 00:05:33,229
It was you that killed that poor old man.

106
00:05:33,263 --> 00:05:35,231
It was you. Now, you're gonna
tell me the truth, or I swear

107
00:05:35,265 --> 00:05:36,899
to God, I'm gonna beat it out of you!

108
00:05:36,934 --> 00:05:38,968
- That old man was a war veteran!
- Listen,

109
00:05:39,002 --> 00:05:40,603
Cat was there. Cat saw
the whole thing. Ask Cat.

110
00:05:40,637 --> 00:05:41,738
- Ask Cat!
- Relax, Macky, relax.

111
00:05:41,772 --> 00:05:43,239
No one's gonna beat you. Who's Cat?

112
00:05:43,273 --> 00:05:44,474
What do you mean, no one's gonna beat him?

113
00:05:44,508 --> 00:05:45,842
Isn't that what I just said I was gonna do

114
00:05:45,876 --> 00:05:47,043
right now, just now? I was gonna beat him?

115
00:05:47,077 --> 00:05:48,778
GORDON: Come here! Come here. Come here.

116
00:05:50,547 --> 00:05:52,415
He is 16.

117
00:05:52,449 --> 00:05:55,585
Yeah, and six-foot,
220. He can take a punch.

118
00:05:55,619 --> 00:05:57,854
Look, I wasn't gonna beat him.
I just wanted to scare him.

119
00:05:57,888 --> 00:05:59,856
But if I did want to beat him, I could.

120
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,858
- It would be my prerogative.
- It's illegal.

121
00:06:01,892 --> 00:06:03,359
Ill...

122
00:06:03,394 --> 00:06:05,795
How now so righteous?

123
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:08,598
Hmm? Not long since you
put a man in the river.

124
00:06:11,635 --> 00:06:13,603
You want to say that a little louder?

125
00:06:13,637 --> 00:06:15,438
Not everybody heard.

126
00:06:15,472 --> 00:06:17,807
Ever since then, you've been a royal
pain in the ass. You think I or anybody

127
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:20,243
around here gives a
crap about a dead snitch

128
00:06:20,277 --> 00:06:21,544
or your guilty conscience?

129
00:06:21,578 --> 00:06:23,279
- We got our own problems.
- Guilty conscience,

130
00:06:23,313 --> 00:06:25,281
call it what you want.
I'm gonna do what's right.

131
00:06:25,315 --> 00:06:27,283
You're beginning to irritate me.

132
00:06:27,317 --> 00:06:28,618
Get your hands off me.

133
00:06:28,652 --> 00:06:30,453
Hey!

134
00:06:30,487 --> 00:06:32,889
Watch the shoes, clown.

135
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,728
Shift's over.

136
00:06:46,136 --> 00:06:48,137
(rock music blaring)

137
00:06:53,877 --> 00:06:56,779
(laughing)

138
00:06:59,683 --> 00:07:01,818
(laughing)

139
00:07:01,852 --> 00:07:03,286
Come on.

140
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,620
Come on.

141
00:07:04,655 --> 00:07:06,990
Come on. Seriously.

142
00:07:16,633 --> 00:07:19,068
OSWALD: Thank you so much, guys, truly.

143
00:07:19,103 --> 00:07:21,604
I'm very grateful. I've
been waiting for hours.

144
00:07:21,638 --> 00:07:24,307
No kidding. Look like you
crawled out of a cemetery.

145
00:07:24,341 --> 00:07:27,343
Smells like it, too.
Open a window back there.

146
00:07:28,612 --> 00:07:29,979
(coughing)

147
00:07:30,014 --> 00:07:30,980
- There you go.
- Yeah.

148
00:07:31,015 --> 00:07:32,281
Yes, thank you.

149
00:07:32,316 --> 00:07:35,051
Forgive me, I am somewhat disheveled.

150
00:07:35,085 --> 00:07:37,086
A temporary setback, I assure you.

151
00:07:38,122 --> 00:07:39,355
Thank you so much.

152
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,457
What the hell happened to you anyhow?

153
00:07:41,492 --> 00:07:43,326
It was my own fault.

154
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,528
Foolish arrogance led me astray.

155
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:49,032
But I learned my lessons.

156
00:07:50,495 --> 00:07:54,537
I'll be back, stronger
and smarter than ever.

157
00:07:54,571 --> 00:07:55,838
Good luck with that, bro.

158
00:07:55,873 --> 00:07:58,408
Here I am riding around in a lovely truck,

159
00:07:58,442 --> 00:08:00,810
sharing an ice-cold
beer with my new friends.

160
00:08:00,844 --> 00:08:02,812
My luck's already turned, right?

161
00:08:02,846 --> 00:08:04,280
(chuckling)

162
00:08:04,315 --> 00:08:06,816
Dude, anyone ever tell you, when you walk,

163
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,117
you look just like a penguin?

164
00:08:08,152 --> 00:08:10,019
(laughter)

165
00:08:10,054 --> 00:08:12,355
No.

166
00:08:12,389 --> 00:08:15,825
Nobody's ever told me that.

167
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:30,188
<i>He's saying he has a right to
stop me from beating on a mope.</i>

168
00:08:30,222 --> 00:08:31,255
Damn right I do.

169
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,523
How am I supposed to work with this?

170
00:08:32,558 --> 00:08:34,759
Look it, Jim, it's not like I can order you

171
00:08:34,793 --> 00:08:37,061
to break the law, but this is Gotham.

172
00:08:37,096 --> 00:08:39,197
You don't bend, you'll get broke.

173
00:08:39,231 --> 00:08:40,265
- I understand.
- I thought

174
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:42,107
- you were with the program.
- He is.

175
00:08:42,156 --> 00:08:44,204
Well, let's get back to
work. Where are you at?

176
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:46,304
Well, if the boy we have
is telling the truth,

177
00:08:46,338 --> 00:08:48,306
there's a couple of kidnappers out there

178
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:50,742
abducting homeless children in numbers.

179
00:08:50,776 --> 00:08:52,644
They lured them close with a food truck

180
00:08:52,678 --> 00:08:54,479
from the mayor's Homeless Outreach Project.

181
00:08:54,513 --> 00:08:56,915
And they drugged them
with a jab from a big pin.

182
00:08:56,949 --> 00:08:58,583
Wh-Why would anyone want to abduct

183
00:08:58,617 --> 00:09:00,818
scaggly-ass orphans in bulk?

184
00:09:00,853 --> 00:09:01,986
I mean, where's the market?

185
00:09:02,021 --> 00:09:03,154
They're out on the street

186
00:09:03,188 --> 00:09:04,389
because no one wants them anyway.

187
00:09:04,423 --> 00:09:05,657
If they said they were snatching

188
00:09:05,691 --> 00:09:07,425
cute girls, I'd believe 'em.

189
00:09:07,459 --> 00:09:09,928
But what would anyone want
with a lard-ass like Macky?

190
00:09:09,962 --> 00:09:11,296
What is it, Ed?

191
00:09:14,466 --> 00:09:16,768
Guess what I found.

192
00:09:16,802 --> 00:09:19,137
I did a blood test on him, and he had

193
00:09:19,171 --> 00:09:21,139
high levels of ATP.

194
00:09:21,173 --> 00:09:23,441
What's ATP?

195
00:09:23,475 --> 00:09:25,777
It's a fast-acting knockout drug.

196
00:09:25,811 --> 00:09:27,679
They used to use it at
the old Arkham Asylum

197
00:09:27,713 --> 00:09:29,981
to bring down troublesome patients.

198
00:09:30,015 --> 00:09:32,217
It's hard to get. No recreational use.

199
00:09:32,251 --> 00:09:34,652
Okay. That's interesting.

200
00:09:34,687 --> 00:09:35,687
Anything else?

201
00:09:36,989 --> 00:09:38,690
Thank you, Ed.

202
00:09:39,925 --> 00:09:40,959
(clears throat)

203
00:09:41,727 --> 00:09:44,062
Thank you, Ed.

204
00:09:48,071 --> 00:09:49,038
Get to work.

205
00:09:49,072 --> 00:09:52,041
And keep this quiet. No press. Not a word.

206
00:09:52,075 --> 00:09:54,343
Shouldn't we tell the
public what's going on?

207
00:09:54,377 --> 00:09:56,512
- Warn them?
- Department policy.

208
00:09:56,546 --> 00:09:59,181
We don't advertise this
kind of stuff. Causes panic.

209
00:09:59,215 --> 00:10:01,984
The headlines will read
"Gotham's Kids Snatched."

210
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:04,653
- Which would be true.
- No press. That's an order.

211
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:06,889
Follow up on the drug, the ATP

212
00:10:06,923 --> 00:10:08,457
and the Arkham connection.

213
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:10,292
Arkham's been closed for, like, ten years.

214
00:10:10,326 --> 00:10:11,427
Yeah, 15.

215
00:10:11,461 --> 00:10:13,762
Drug suppliers might still be in business.

216
00:10:13,797 --> 00:10:15,164
Oh, uh,

217
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,166
this happened on Fish Mooney's turf.

218
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,902
Do you want to see if it's
safe for us to go back there,

219
00:10:19,936 --> 00:10:21,537
or is, uh, she still mad at us?

220
00:10:21,571 --> 00:10:23,639
That's a good question.

221
00:10:23,673 --> 00:10:26,008
(playing rock music)

222
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:35,317
(cheering and applause)

223
00:10:35,352 --> 00:10:37,653
Bravo!

224
00:10:37,687 --> 00:10:38,921
Bravo!

225
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,529
Don Falcone.

226
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,933
What a wonderful surprise. Welcome.

227
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:52,267
Thank you, my dear.

228
00:10:52,302 --> 00:10:54,203
Can we... talk?

229
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:56,268
Of course. Give me a
moment to clear the place.

230
00:10:56,269 --> 00:10:58,948
No, no. No need to spoil the fun.

231
00:11:13,189 --> 00:11:16,158
Men who are about to die are very honest.

232
00:11:16,192 --> 00:11:17,860
It pays to listen to them.

233
00:11:17,894 --> 00:11:21,030
That's some toast.

234
00:11:24,634 --> 00:11:27,403
I spoke with your man
Cobblepot before he died.

235
00:11:28,805 --> 00:11:31,240
Odd little fellow. Perceptive.

236
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:33,142
He told me the death of the Waynes

237
00:11:33,176 --> 00:11:36,512
would bring troubled times
for our family and Gotham.

238
00:11:36,546 --> 00:11:39,148
(sighs) What did he know?

239
00:11:39,182 --> 00:11:42,284
- Business is good as ever.
- No, he was right.

240
00:11:42,319 --> 00:11:47,423
The Waynes and the Falcones were
the pillars of the same house.

241
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:49,692
We understood each other.

242
00:11:49,726 --> 00:11:52,628
Now that they're gone,
everything is out of balance,

243
00:11:52,662 --> 00:11:55,998
and the Wayne Empire is in flux.

244
00:11:56,032 --> 00:11:59,301
Who knows who will end up in control?

245
00:11:59,336 --> 00:12:02,071
The Maroni family senses weakness.

246
00:12:02,105 --> 00:12:03,572
They'll start making moves,

247
00:12:03,607 --> 00:12:06,675
and every criminal in the
city will start making moves.

248
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:09,378
Please don't lose any sleep over Maroni.

249
00:12:09,412 --> 00:12:11,380
He's number two for a reason.

250
00:12:11,414 --> 00:12:14,216
I never lose sleep over my enemies.

251
00:12:14,251 --> 00:12:16,952
It's my friends that keep me awake.

252
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:19,555
- Huh.
- Cobblepot told me

253
00:12:19,589 --> 00:12:22,591
you say I'm old and soft

254
00:12:22,626 --> 00:12:25,761
and ready to be taken out,
and you're the one to take me.

255
00:12:27,797 --> 00:12:30,666
Don Falcone, I would never,

256
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,302
<i>ever say that.</i>

257
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:36,739
I only have deep love and respect for you.

258
00:12:36,773 --> 00:12:40,075
You have been like a father to me.

259
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:44,513
I'm so... happy to hear that.

260
00:12:44,548 --> 00:12:46,815
Let's forget all about it, then.

261
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,818
The babbling of a condemned man.

262
00:12:53,123 --> 00:12:55,024
(clears his throat)

263
00:12:55,058 --> 00:12:56,759
Enough business.

264
00:12:56,793 --> 00:12:58,394
How have you been, my dear?

265
00:12:58,428 --> 00:12:59,995
Thriving, I hope.

266
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,264
Yes. Good. I'm good.

267
00:13:02,299 --> 00:13:04,333
(clears his throat)

268
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:07,503
Which of these is your lover?

269
00:13:07,537 --> 00:13:09,805
Please. My heart has been broken

270
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,641
far too many times for that nonsense.

271
00:13:12,676 --> 00:13:14,443
Hmm.

272
00:13:14,478 --> 00:13:16,645
I heard you had a lover.

273
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,947
Well, if you're referring

274
00:13:17,981 --> 00:13:20,349
to the boy that I keep
around for exercise...

275
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:23,285
my lover he is not.

276
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,821
(clears his throat) (snaps his fingers)

277
00:13:31,294 --> 00:13:32,461
What's your name?

278
00:13:32,496 --> 00:13:33,662
Lazlo, sir.

279
00:13:33,697 --> 00:13:36,532
Lazlo, be good to this woman.

280
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:38,701
She's very precious to me.

281
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,736
If you break her heart,

282
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,671
you break my heart.

283
00:13:42,706 --> 00:13:44,373
Yes, sir.

284
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:46,542
Mmm.

285
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:49,812
(Lazlo groaning)

286
00:13:53,183 --> 00:13:55,217
Give me your hand.

287
00:13:55,252 --> 00:13:58,154
(blows landing, Lazlo
groaning, glass breaking)

288
00:13:58,188 --> 00:14:00,489
Thank you for being honest.
It means a lot to me.

289
00:14:00,524 --> 00:14:02,725
- (Lazlo groaning)
- It shows wisdom

290
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,827
and humility.

291
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:19,108
Out!

292
00:14:23,447 --> 00:14:26,348
Everyone out!

293
00:14:34,057 --> 00:14:37,059
WOMAN: Never, never in his life

294
00:14:37,094 --> 00:14:40,062
my son is away this long.

295
00:14:40,097 --> 00:14:43,165
Nightclubs is his business.

296
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,934
Such hours.

297
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:49,705
But always, he comes home to his mother.

298
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,807
His clothes are here.

299
00:14:51,842 --> 00:14:55,578
My son would never leave his clothes.

300
00:14:55,612 --> 00:14:58,414
Oh, so elegant, he is.

301
00:14:58,448 --> 00:15:00,549
Yes, I-I show you.

302
00:15:00,584 --> 00:15:03,886
(whispers): Damn. Mooney and the
cops must have had him killed.

303
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,654
Looks like the snitches get bumped.

304
00:15:05,689 --> 00:15:07,223
That's life.

305
00:15:07,257 --> 00:15:08,891
They're not going to get away with it,

306
00:15:08,925 --> 00:15:10,226
not as easy as they think.

307
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,927
You take things too
personally, you know what?

308
00:15:11,962 --> 00:15:14,563
Yeah, I do. That was a good snitch.

309
00:15:14,598 --> 00:15:15,765
- What are we...?
- Nothing.

310
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:18,668
- Uh, Mrs. Cobblepot...
- Kapelput.

311
00:15:18,702 --> 00:15:21,203
Mrs. Kapelput, do you know anyone

312
00:15:21,238 --> 00:15:23,506
who might want to do your son harm?

313
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,274
Harm?

314
00:15:25,308 --> 00:15:28,644
No. I-I would feel it.

315
00:15:28,679 --> 00:15:30,946
A mother feels these things.

316
00:15:30,981 --> 00:15:32,848
It's a woman.

317
00:15:32,883 --> 00:15:37,286
Some painted slut has him in her clutch.

318
00:15:37,321 --> 00:15:39,422
A woman... you think?

319
00:15:39,456 --> 00:15:41,490
I am sure.

320
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:44,593
So handsome he is.

321
00:15:44,628 --> 00:15:46,996
And so naive.

322
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:50,666
(laughs) Who are you again?

323
00:15:50,701 --> 00:15:54,203
Uh, detectives with
Major Crimes Unit, ma'am.

324
00:15:54,237 --> 00:15:57,206
Oh, GCPD.

325
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,042
- Like that.
- But honest.

326
00:16:00,077 --> 00:16:01,944
Hmm.

327
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,981
<i>GILZEAN: Boss, don't get mad at me,</i>

328
00:16:05,015 --> 00:16:07,016
but I know that look.

329
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:12,221
Now is too early to make a move on Falcone.

330
00:16:13,323 --> 00:16:15,291
I know.

331
00:16:15,325 --> 00:16:17,293
Not yet.

332
00:16:17,327 --> 00:16:21,330
I need more money, more
men, more territory, I know.

333
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,569
I'll play this thing
loyal and bide my time.

334
00:16:28,805 --> 00:16:31,540
But I swear, Butch,

335
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:34,243
on my sainted mother's grave,

336
00:16:34,278 --> 00:16:36,412
some day soon,

337
00:16:36,446 --> 00:16:38,614
I am going to kill that old man

338
00:16:38,649 --> 00:16:42,752
with my bare hands and my teeth.

339
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:50,159
I'll be holding your shoes.

340
00:16:53,564 --> 00:16:58,100
I just wish that Penguin was still alive.

341
00:16:59,736 --> 00:17:02,104
I didn't make that little punk

342
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:06,008
suffer near badly enough.

343
00:17:15,385 --> 00:17:17,286
Excuse me, sir?

344
00:17:17,321 --> 00:17:18,721
Uh...

345
00:17:21,391 --> 00:17:25,127
I couldn't help but notice
the sign on your trailer.

346
00:17:25,162 --> 00:17:26,562
Is it still for rent?

347
00:17:26,597 --> 00:17:28,464
100 bucks a week. It ain't much, but...

348
00:17:28,498 --> 00:17:30,800
- I'll take it.
- You don't want to look at it first?

349
00:17:30,834 --> 00:17:32,435
No, I'm not fussy.

350
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:36,873
- It's all yours.
- The key?

351
00:17:36,907 --> 00:17:40,376
Hey, sweet truck. You got
that big hemi in there?

352
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:43,045
Yes. Yup.

353
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,114
That big hemi's in there.

354
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:46,916
(laughs) Somewhere.

355
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,585
(sniffles) Uh, sir, the key?

356
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,654
It's in the door.

357
00:17:51,688 --> 00:17:54,056
Okay.

358
00:18:01,298 --> 00:18:03,332
(groans)

359
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:06,936
What's up, players?

360
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:08,337
You got any smokes?

361
00:18:08,372 --> 00:18:11,574
No.

362
00:18:16,713 --> 00:18:17,914
Where are we?

363
00:18:19,116 --> 00:18:21,083
Damn if I know.

364
00:18:21,118 --> 00:18:23,986
(clanking)

365
00:18:27,391 --> 00:18:29,292
I think we're dead.

366
00:18:40,434 --> 00:18:42,402
MOONEY: Harvey.

367
00:18:42,436 --> 00:18:44,504
Jim. How marvelous.

368
00:18:44,538 --> 00:18:47,273
You still mad at us?

369
00:18:47,308 --> 00:18:49,209
No. Please.

370
00:18:49,243 --> 00:18:51,344
I'm quite fond of you, and...

371
00:18:51,379 --> 00:18:53,647
you intrigue me.

372
00:18:53,681 --> 00:18:57,417
I knew I'd regret killing you
as soon as I gave the word.

373
00:18:57,451 --> 00:19:00,487
But you know me. I'm feisty.

374
00:19:00,521 --> 00:19:01,888
(laughs) What do you know about

375
00:19:01,922 --> 00:19:04,324
a man and a woman abducting
street kids on your turf?

376
00:19:04,358 --> 00:19:06,559
No foreplay with you, hmm?

377
00:19:06,594 --> 00:19:10,297
Figures, but you got with the program.

378
00:19:10,331 --> 00:19:13,166
Killed Penguin your own bad self.

379
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,567
I was surprised.

380
00:19:14,602 --> 00:19:16,403
Straight arrow like you.

381
00:19:16,437 --> 00:19:19,239
- I guess you misjudged me.
- I guess I did.

382
00:19:19,273 --> 00:19:23,277
You're just a little
sinner like the rest of us.

383
00:19:23,339 --> 00:19:27,180
I'm almost kind of sad about that.

384
00:19:27,214 --> 00:19:29,649
We're looking for a man and a woman,

385
00:19:29,684 --> 00:19:31,351
middle-aged,

386
00:19:31,385 --> 00:19:34,588
white, targeting children under 16.

387
00:19:34,622 --> 00:19:37,490
They use a poisoned pin,
if you can believe it.

388
00:19:37,525 --> 00:19:41,361
Oh. Used to be there was only
a market for nice-looking girls.

389
00:19:41,395 --> 00:19:43,363
That's what I said.

390
00:19:43,397 --> 00:19:45,365
But now there's a new buyer overseas

391
00:19:45,399 --> 00:19:47,601
that will take anyone young and healthy.

392
00:19:47,635 --> 00:19:50,971
- Overseas where? Who's "they"?
- Nobody knows.

393
00:19:51,005 --> 00:19:53,640
- What do they want 'em for?
- Nobody knows.

394
00:19:53,674 --> 00:19:57,477
<i>And no one cares to know.</i>

395
00:20:03,808 --> 00:20:05,619
Ta-da! Moo shu...

396
00:20:05,653 --> 00:20:07,621
Sorry. Go on.

397
00:20:07,655 --> 00:20:09,356
They drug them with a big pin?

398
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:10,824
That is so creepy.

399
00:20:10,858 --> 00:20:13,293
No, you don't want to hear
this stuff. It's depressing.

400
00:20:13,327 --> 00:20:15,462
What do they use them for? The children?

401
00:20:15,496 --> 00:20:17,731
Nobody seems to know.

402
00:20:17,765 --> 00:20:20,634
And we can't say a damn
thing to the press. Bad PR.

403
00:20:20,668 --> 00:20:22,636
I can't believe the system is so corrupt.

404
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:25,405
- You have no idea.
- What do you mean?

405
00:20:27,174 --> 00:20:31,011
No. You know, figure of speech, I guess.

406
00:20:31,045 --> 00:20:33,380
Did something happen that
you're not telling me about?

407
00:20:33,414 --> 00:20:35,148
These last couple of weeks...

408
00:20:35,183 --> 00:20:38,084
you've been different, troubled.

409
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:40,387
Hmm.

410
00:20:40,421 --> 00:20:42,389
No.

411
00:20:42,423 --> 00:20:44,758
Been having trouble sleeping, I guess.

412
00:20:46,994 --> 00:20:49,729
The newspapers must get
anonymous tips all the time.

413
00:20:49,764 --> 00:20:51,731
Oh, sure, yeah.

414
00:20:51,766 --> 00:20:54,201
You mean, call it in myself?

415
00:20:54,235 --> 00:20:55,902
(laughs)

416
00:20:55,937 --> 00:20:57,671
No, I can't do that.

417
00:21:03,277 --> 00:21:04,744
(phone beeps)

418
00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:06,379
<i>Gotham Gazette. The newsroom.</i>

419
00:21:06,414 --> 00:21:08,281
Wait. No.

420
00:21:08,316 --> 00:21:10,016
Hi. Listen, I can't talk long.

421
00:21:10,051 --> 00:21:12,118
Somebody is abducting homeless
children off the streets,

422
00:21:12,153 --> 00:21:14,087
and the cops are trying to keep it quiet.

423
00:21:14,121 --> 00:21:17,090
Go talk to Captain Sarah Essen
of the GCPD. She has got a kid

424
00:21:17,124 --> 00:21:19,593
in custody who can tell
you the whole story.

425
00:21:19,627 --> 00:21:21,294
- End the call.
- I got to go.

426
00:21:23,598 --> 00:21:24,898
Listen to me, Barbara.

427
00:21:24,932 --> 00:21:26,933
When I tell you stuff,
that's just between us.

428
00:21:26,968 --> 00:21:28,368
You can't do that, what you just did.

429
00:21:28,402 --> 00:21:29,903
But it was the right thing to do.

430
00:21:29,937 --> 00:21:31,805
- That's not the point.
- Well, what is the point?

431
00:21:33,341 --> 00:21:34,474
You're right.

432
00:21:34,509 --> 00:21:37,077
It was the right thing to do.

433
00:21:37,111 --> 00:21:40,547
- Don't do it again, okay?
- Yes, boss.

434
00:21:41,649 --> 00:21:44,484
"Gotham spirals ever downward."

435
00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:46,086
"Mayor James under attack."

436
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,755
"Vows swift action." "Points finger

437
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:52,325
at police department's
sluggish response." Et cetera.

438
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,761
- It's just ink.
- Did you give them this?

439
00:21:54,796 --> 00:21:56,062
Me?

440
00:21:56,097 --> 00:21:59,266
- You've done it before.
- On my own case? Never.

441
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,301
Be a very stupid thing to do.

442
00:22:01,335 --> 00:22:02,602
ESSEN: Jim?

443
00:22:03,771 --> 00:22:05,105
I didn't call it in.

444
00:22:06,274 --> 00:22:08,775
- I swear.
- Another mystery.

445
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,477
We have a thin lead on the case,

446
00:22:10,511 --> 00:22:11,978
if you'd like to hear it, ma'am.

447
00:22:12,013 --> 00:22:13,480
There's only three companies

448
00:22:13,514 --> 00:22:15,282
in Gotham that stock this ATP stuff,

449
00:22:15,316 --> 00:22:17,651
and you need a special license to buy it.

450
00:22:17,685 --> 00:22:19,286
Chances are, one of the three's crooked.

451
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,021
We're looking to lean hard on all three,

452
00:22:21,055 --> 00:22:24,558
like they are crooked, see which one pops.

453
00:22:34,235 --> 00:22:35,836
That was sneaky good.

454
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:37,604
Almost couldn't tell you were lying.

455
00:22:37,638 --> 00:22:38,939
I wasn't lying.

456
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,808
Good morning, Judge Baker.

457
00:22:41,843 --> 00:22:43,810
Thank you, sir. Yes, all three.

458
00:22:43,845 --> 00:22:45,011
Welzyne,

459
00:22:45,046 --> 00:22:47,481
Dracotech and Quillan Pharma.

460
00:22:52,253 --> 00:22:54,988
<i>MAN: You guys have screwed me.</i>

461
00:22:55,023 --> 00:22:56,990
Against my better judgment,

462
00:22:57,025 --> 00:22:58,658
I sell you the juice,

463
00:22:58,693 --> 00:23:01,228
I let you guys use my storage space

464
00:23:01,262 --> 00:23:03,897
because, "No problem," you said.

465
00:23:03,931 --> 00:23:06,900
And now look. Heat.

466
00:23:06,934 --> 00:23:08,335
White-hot heat.

467
00:23:08,369 --> 00:23:10,237
No problems, my friend.

468
00:23:10,271 --> 00:23:11,905
We're here to take the merch away.

469
00:23:11,939 --> 00:23:13,640
You'll be clean as a whistle.

470
00:23:13,675 --> 00:23:15,609
Merch?

471
00:23:15,643 --> 00:23:17,177
They're children, damn it.

472
00:23:17,211 --> 00:23:19,212
They're human beings.

473
00:23:19,247 --> 00:23:21,381
Didn't I tell you to check
on them ten minutes ago?

474
00:23:24,385 --> 00:23:26,553
I want another five large.

475
00:23:26,587 --> 00:23:28,021
But we had a deal already.

476
00:23:28,056 --> 00:23:30,057
I got to stand up for what is right here.

477
00:23:30,091 --> 00:23:33,026
Be fair, sir. We don't have
that kind of cash on hand.

478
00:23:33,061 --> 00:23:35,362
That's your problem. I can wait.

479
00:23:35,396 --> 00:23:37,397
I thought you was worried about the heat.

480
00:23:37,432 --> 00:23:39,366
Well, if heat arrives in the meantime,

481
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,102
I can get rid of the evidence very quickly.

482
00:23:42,136 --> 00:23:43,704
We have an obligation to deliver.

483
00:23:43,738 --> 00:23:46,006
The Dollmaker doesn't tolerate failure.

484
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,942
- We need those children.
- Well, that's also your problem.

485
00:23:52,213 --> 00:23:53,213
(groans)

486
00:23:55,483 --> 00:23:59,219
No. Hey, hey, this is
totally inappropriate.

487
00:23:59,253 --> 00:24:01,888
I mean, we were having a
business discussion here.

488
00:24:01,923 --> 00:24:03,624
You weren't being fair.

489
00:24:07,962 --> 00:24:10,263
Oh, gosh. Cops.

490
00:24:13,234 --> 00:24:15,102
<i>You didn't call the
Gazette, but did your girl</i>

491
00:24:15,136 --> 00:24:17,070
<i>- call the Gazette?
- Yeah.</i>

492
00:24:17,105 --> 00:24:19,640
- I knew it.
- I didn't know she was gonna call 'em.

493
00:24:19,674 --> 00:24:21,775
Seriously, you got to
learn to control your woman.

494
00:24:21,809 --> 00:24:23,577
I kind of like her the way she is.

495
00:24:23,611 --> 00:24:25,112
No, these high-class
temperamental broads...

496
00:24:25,146 --> 00:24:26,980
they need firm handling. Trust me.

497
00:24:27,015 --> 00:24:29,316
- Trust you? On women?
- Damn right.

498
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,718
All varieties. From
hausfraus to movie stars.

499
00:24:31,753 --> 00:24:35,088
I love 'em all. Now, you? Let me guess.

500
00:24:35,123 --> 00:24:37,491
High school sweetheart.
Then a bunch of hos overseas

501
00:24:37,525 --> 00:24:39,259
only made you sad,

502
00:24:39,294 --> 00:24:40,827
and then there's Barbara.

503
00:24:40,862 --> 00:24:42,296
Pretty much.

504
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:44,965
You, my friend, are a monkey

505
00:24:44,999 --> 00:24:46,466
riding a racehorse.

506
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,110
Good evening. May I help you?

507
00:24:57,145 --> 00:24:58,912
Detectives Gordon and
Bullock. We need to speak

508
00:24:58,947 --> 00:25:00,948
- to whoever's in charge here, ma'am.
- Of course.

509
00:25:00,982 --> 00:25:03,584
Mr. Quillan, detectives
are here to see you.

510
00:25:03,618 --> 00:25:04,985
Oh?

511
00:25:06,454 --> 00:25:08,155
Oh, wow. (short laugh)

512
00:25:08,189 --> 00:25:09,923
Detectives. Hey, what's up?

513
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:11,458
Nothing serious, I hope.

514
00:25:11,492 --> 00:25:14,228
Cut the crap. We have a
warrant to search the premises.

515
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:15,529
We know what you're doing.

516
00:25:15,563 --> 00:25:17,464
Well, then, you know
some boring stuff, then.

517
00:25:17,498 --> 00:25:19,166
I mean, what are you talking about?

518
00:25:20,301 --> 00:25:22,369
You're peddling ATP to those kid snatchers.

519
00:25:22,403 --> 00:25:24,538
Oh, my gosh, no. I-I mean,

520
00:25:24,572 --> 00:25:27,007
we used to stock ATP, but not since

521
00:25:27,041 --> 00:25:29,176
the Arkham Asylum closed.

522
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:32,145
Uh, uh... I heard that the Wayne Foundation

523
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,147
is planning on reopening

524
00:25:34,182 --> 00:25:35,883
the old place again.

525
00:25:35,917 --> 00:25:37,384
But now that the Waynes are dead,

526
00:25:37,418 --> 00:25:39,319
I guess everything's up in the air.

527
00:25:39,354 --> 00:25:40,821
Uh...

528
00:25:40,855 --> 00:25:42,322
what a world, eh?

529
00:25:42,357 --> 00:25:44,057
Nobody's safe.

530
00:25:56,204 --> 00:25:57,571
(click)

531
00:25:57,605 --> 00:25:59,806
Jim! Go, go!

532
00:25:59,841 --> 00:26:02,576
(tires screech, engine revs)

533
00:26:08,216 --> 00:26:10,050
(gasps)

534
00:26:11,886 --> 00:26:13,654
Where the hell were you?

535
00:26:13,688 --> 00:26:15,322
Get rid of 'em now.

536
00:26:15,356 --> 00:26:17,558
And hose down the room.

537
00:26:29,571 --> 00:26:30,737
Zeb.

538
00:26:31,639 --> 00:26:32,873
Freeze.

539
00:26:33,808 --> 00:26:36,076
(grunts)

540
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:39,246
(echoing scream)

541
00:26:48,721 --> 00:26:50,836
On behalf of all the citizens of Gotham,

542
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,237
I want to thank you brave gentlemen

543
00:26:52,271 --> 00:26:55,340
from the bottom of my heart,
and I want to promise you kids...

544
00:26:55,375 --> 00:26:57,442
we will take care of you

545
00:26:57,477 --> 00:26:59,811
as if you were our own children.

546
00:26:59,846 --> 00:27:01,513
But here's the thing.

547
00:27:01,547 --> 00:27:05,217
The people who victimized
these kids are still out there.

548
00:27:05,251 --> 00:27:07,819
And hundreds of vulnerable youngsters

549
00:27:07,854 --> 00:27:10,022
are still living rough on our streets.

550
00:27:10,056 --> 00:27:13,191
<i>Alone, unprotected,</i>

551
00:27:13,226 --> 00:27:14,493
<i>and let's face it,</i>

552
00:27:14,527 --> 00:27:17,362
<i>that's the real crime here. So what are we</i>

553
00:27:17,397 --> 00:27:19,164
going to do to help these kids?

554
00:27:19,198 --> 00:27:22,067
<i>Yesterday I made a phone call</i>

555
00:27:22,101 --> 00:27:24,703
<i>to Juvenile Services and the GCPD</i>

556
00:27:24,737 --> 00:27:27,372
<i>to initiate a humane
but tough-love program</i>

557
00:27:27,407 --> 00:27:30,409
<i>to get these kids off the streets</i>

558
00:27:30,443 --> 00:27:31,910
and into the loving arms

559
00:27:31,944 --> 00:27:33,779
of Juvenile Services.

560
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:40,352
- I think that went very well.
- I think so.

561
00:27:40,386 --> 00:27:42,721
A small toast, Your Honor?

562
00:27:42,755 --> 00:27:43,889
You read my mind.

563
00:27:43,923 --> 00:27:46,024
Mr. Mayor.

564
00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:47,559
Uh, where are you sending

565
00:27:47,593 --> 00:27:49,294
all the children that get rounded up?

566
00:27:49,329 --> 00:27:52,097
Foster homes for the cute, undamaged ones.

567
00:27:52,131 --> 00:27:54,900
- Upstate for the rest.
- Upstate?

568
00:27:54,934 --> 00:27:57,035
The Alpena Youth Corrections Facility.

569
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,370
A fine institute.

570
00:27:58,404 --> 00:28:00,105
Prison, in other words.

571
00:28:00,139 --> 00:28:02,341
Forgive me, Your Honor.

572
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:04,409
Detective Gordon's our house firebrand.

573
00:28:04,444 --> 00:28:05,877
No, no, no, th-that's okay.

574
00:28:05,912 --> 00:28:08,246
Jim... May I call you Jim?

575
00:28:09,549 --> 00:28:11,583
Half the petty crime in the city

576
00:28:11,618 --> 00:28:14,853
is homeless kids. They need structure.

577
00:28:14,887 --> 00:28:16,488
People who care for them.

578
00:28:16,522 --> 00:28:19,424
For the greater good of Gotham
and for the children. You see?

579
00:28:19,459 --> 00:28:21,660
I see you're using the child snatchers

580
00:28:21,694 --> 00:28:23,795
as a pretext to lock up children

581
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,631
without a trial.

582
00:28:27,533 --> 00:28:29,835
Thank you, my friend.

583
00:28:29,869 --> 00:28:31,570
Valuable input.

584
00:28:31,604 --> 00:28:33,472
Most refreshing.

585
00:28:33,506 --> 00:28:34,906
<i>L'chaim.</i>

586
00:28:37,644 --> 00:28:40,145
- (indistinct chatter)
- Yo, Gordon.

587
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:42,180
Man's been waiting for you upstairs.

588
00:28:48,855 --> 00:28:50,322
Mr. Pennyworth.

589
00:28:50,356 --> 00:28:53,492
Alfred, please.

590
00:28:53,526 --> 00:28:54,826
It's bedlam, isn't it?

591
00:28:54,861 --> 00:28:56,862
Rough job you got.

592
00:28:58,698 --> 00:28:59,998
Best job in the world.

593
00:29:01,301 --> 00:29:03,268
I wonder if it might be convenient

594
00:29:03,303 --> 00:29:05,637
for you to visit us tomorrow.

595
00:29:05,672 --> 00:29:07,005
Of course.

596
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,708
- Why? Is something wrong?
- I don't know.

597
00:29:09,742 --> 00:29:12,511
Never had a child before.

598
00:29:12,545 --> 00:29:13,845
Nor me.

599
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,781
The boy respects you.

600
00:29:17,183 --> 00:29:19,685
Teatime, shall we say?

601
00:29:20,887 --> 00:29:22,888
Teatime.

602
00:29:27,927 --> 00:29:30,929
(heavy metal playing over earbuds)

603
00:29:44,277 --> 00:29:46,278
(indistinct announcement over P.A.)

604
00:29:49,816 --> 00:29:51,183
Name.

605
00:29:51,217 --> 00:29:53,485
Ma'am, there's been a mistake.

606
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,087
I'm not meant to go upstate. I need to talk

607
00:29:55,121 --> 00:29:56,488
to James Gordon. He's a cop.

608
00:29:56,523 --> 00:29:58,457
You'll be allowed a phone
call when you get upstate.

609
00:29:58,491 --> 00:30:00,926
- Name.
- I need to talk to him now.

610
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,662
- He'll thank you for it.
- Not happening. Name.

611
00:30:03,696 --> 00:30:05,164
Bite me, pigarina.

612
00:30:05,198 --> 00:30:07,366
Jane Doe.

613
00:30:28,955 --> 00:30:30,322
Hey.

614
00:30:30,356 --> 00:30:32,758
Relax, kid. Juvie's not so bad.

615
00:30:32,792 --> 00:30:36,061
First week, whatever you do,

616
00:30:36,095 --> 00:30:38,897
don't make friends with
anyone that's friendly.

617
00:30:38,932 --> 00:30:41,567
When you get into a
fight, go for their eyes.

618
00:30:42,802 --> 00:30:44,937
Hiya, kids. How you doing?

619
00:30:44,971 --> 00:30:47,406
Are you ready to go on a big adventure?

620
00:30:49,275 --> 00:30:50,375
Sit down, young lady.

621
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:54,246
I said sit down.

622
00:30:55,348 --> 00:30:57,316
Like now.

623
00:31:03,123 --> 00:31:04,723
Okay.

624
00:31:04,758 --> 00:31:07,593
Next naughty child to stand up

625
00:31:07,627 --> 00:31:10,796
gets a black mark right here.

626
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,131
(engine starts)

627
00:31:22,752 --> 00:31:26,273
One or two or three...
I could explain that.

628
00:31:26,307 --> 00:31:27,441
But a busload...

629
00:31:27,475 --> 00:31:29,710
a whole busload of the little bastards...

630
00:31:29,744 --> 00:31:31,011
what am I supposed to say?

631
00:31:31,045 --> 00:31:33,714
Oops? Just tell me it
wasn't them, I'm begging you.

632
00:31:33,748 --> 00:31:35,749
Just tell me it wasn't the snatchers.

633
00:31:35,783 --> 00:31:38,719
Bus driver was a man, guard was a woman.

634
00:31:38,753 --> 00:31:40,020
It could be them.

635
00:31:40,054 --> 00:31:42,890
You're killing me. You're killing me.

636
00:31:42,924 --> 00:31:44,892
We're working it, Your Honor.

637
00:31:44,926 --> 00:31:47,194
(groaning)

638
00:31:47,228 --> 00:31:49,596
Look, I told you everything
I know. I told you.

639
00:31:49,631 --> 00:31:50,864
Now, you see that man there?

640
00:31:50,899 --> 00:31:52,800
He doesn't like it when I
beat people, but for you,

641
00:31:52,834 --> 00:31:55,202
he's got no objection. Why is that?

642
00:31:55,236 --> 00:31:58,572
Math. The lives of 30
children versus one scumbag.

643
00:31:58,606 --> 00:32:00,440
So I can beat you like a bongo drum

644
00:32:00,475 --> 00:32:01,909
and Saint Jim here won't intervene.

645
00:32:01,943 --> 00:32:03,143
Give us something.

646
00:32:03,178 --> 00:32:05,445
Okay, okay, look...

647
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,281
The truck. You know, when they came to

648
00:32:07,315 --> 00:32:08,816
pick up the last bunch of kids.

649
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,884
On the side of it, there was a-a picture.

650
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:13,287
Like a logo. I-I didn't want to say before

651
00:32:13,321 --> 00:32:14,788
because it would give a bad impression.

652
00:32:14,823 --> 00:32:16,757
See, it doesn't reflect,
really, what, you know...

653
00:32:16,791 --> 00:32:18,225
- What was it?
- It has a...

654
00:32:18,259 --> 00:32:20,994
a blue plate and a silver fork.

655
00:32:21,029 --> 00:32:24,665
- A plate and a fork?
- Yeah, you know, like, with the...

656
00:32:24,699 --> 00:32:26,400
- Like a catering company? Like food?
- Well, yeah, like that,

657
00:32:26,434 --> 00:32:28,268
I mean, you know, but, I mean, that

658
00:32:28,303 --> 00:32:31,438
- doesn't mean... You know.
- Doesn't mean what?

659
00:32:31,473 --> 00:32:33,607
Look, I don't know what
they do to them. Aah!

660
00:32:33,641 --> 00:32:35,909
Hey. Hey.

661
00:32:35,944 --> 00:32:39,613
All right, draw the logo. Uncuff him.

662
00:32:46,387 --> 00:32:48,655
There you go, kids.

663
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:50,991
Don't worry. Everything's
gonna be all right.

664
00:32:51,025 --> 00:32:52,459
That's right. That's right. Come on.

665
00:32:52,494 --> 00:32:54,428
Come on, come on, come
on, come on. Come on!

666
00:32:54,462 --> 00:32:56,997
Go.

667
00:33:00,568 --> 00:33:02,369
Funny thing. By my count,

668
00:33:02,404 --> 00:33:04,805
according to the sheet they
gave us, we're one short.

669
00:33:04,839 --> 00:33:08,108
Me, too. Maybe there's one on the bus. Hmm.

670
00:33:09,878 --> 00:33:11,945
(children gasping, whimpering)

671
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,113
Shh!

672
00:34:00,996 --> 00:34:03,364
Nope. Weird.

673
00:34:03,398 --> 00:34:04,965
Must be a miscount someplace.

674
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,700
Never mind. We got more than enough.

675
00:34:06,735 --> 00:34:07,735
We did good.

676
00:34:07,769 --> 00:34:09,503
Indeed we did. (laughs)

677
00:34:09,537 --> 00:34:12,339
The Dollmaker will be so pleased with us.

678
00:34:12,374 --> 00:34:14,742
All right, thanks. Nothing. You?

679
00:34:14,776 --> 00:34:16,744
Apparently, there are no companies

680
00:34:16,778 --> 00:34:19,580
in Gotham with trucks with a
plate and a fork as their logo.

681
00:34:19,614 --> 00:34:21,582
Selling children for food?

682
00:34:21,616 --> 00:34:23,684
Is such a thing even possible?

683
00:34:24,986 --> 00:34:27,121
We've got officers searching all the trucks

684
00:34:27,155 --> 00:34:28,622
on every bridge and tunnel.

685
00:34:28,657 --> 00:34:30,958
But they had a three-hour window.

686
00:34:30,992 --> 00:34:33,027
We can only pray they stayed in the city.

687
00:34:33,061 --> 00:34:36,063
If not, they could be any
place on Earth by nightfall.

688
00:34:36,097 --> 00:34:37,631
BULLOCK: Scum-sucking
toads. Where are they?!

689
00:34:41,403 --> 00:34:43,203
It's not a blue plate.

690
00:34:43,238 --> 00:34:45,472
It's not a fork, either. It's a trident.

691
00:34:46,508 --> 00:34:48,709
PATTI: When you stow this on the ship,

692
00:34:48,743 --> 00:34:51,278
make sure there's plenty of
room for the doors to open.

693
00:34:51,313 --> 00:34:52,446
The ship's crew has...

694
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,881
- (loud knocking)
- Let me out!

695
00:34:53,915 --> 00:34:55,316
(indistinct shouting of children)

696
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:58,385
Quiet in there!

697
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,920
(indistinct shout of man)

698
00:34:59,955 --> 00:35:01,388
(coughing)

699
00:35:01,423 --> 00:35:03,223
- (whimpering)
- Hush.

700
00:35:03,258 --> 00:35:05,059
Hush.

701
00:35:05,093 --> 00:35:06,393
(crying)

702
00:35:06,428 --> 00:35:07,962
My eyes! She scratched me!

703
00:35:07,996 --> 00:35:09,129
Oh!

704
00:35:09,164 --> 00:35:10,297
DOUG: Come on, follow me.

705
00:35:10,332 --> 00:35:12,533
(man whimpering)

706
00:35:12,567 --> 00:35:14,568
Mmm. Let me look.

707
00:35:15,637 --> 00:35:17,605
Hmm. Yeah.

708
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:19,440
It's nothing. It's a scratch.

709
00:35:19,474 --> 00:35:20,908
We'll get you to the doctor,

710
00:35:20,942 --> 00:35:22,810
you'll be right as rain in no time.

711
00:35:22,844 --> 00:35:25,279
You sure?

712
00:35:25,313 --> 00:35:26,680
(click)

713
00:35:26,715 --> 00:35:28,582
What was that? Hang on.

714
00:35:30,518 --> 00:35:33,187
(children screaming)

715
00:36:15,764 --> 00:36:16,830
Well...

716
00:36:18,533 --> 00:36:20,901
You are a very naughty little girl.

717
00:36:20,936 --> 00:36:22,469
(cocks gun)

718
00:36:28,009 --> 00:36:30,878
Hi. What's your name?

719
00:36:30,912 --> 00:36:32,646
Why is that your business?

720
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:37,218
Jim!

721
00:36:41,089 --> 00:36:43,190
Where are the kids?

722
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:45,860
Where are they?!

723
00:36:50,149 --> 00:36:51,862
He's not been sleeping.

724
00:36:53,413 --> 00:36:56,047
And when he does, he has these nightmares.

725
00:36:56,081 --> 00:36:58,116
Now he's hurting himself.

726
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,118
Burning himself.

727
00:37:00,152 --> 00:37:01,886
He's cutting.

728
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:04,021
Is he getting professional help?

729
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:05,623
Oh, you mean a psychiatrist?

730
00:37:05,657 --> 00:37:07,959
No, no, he won't have 'em.

731
00:37:07,993 --> 00:37:11,462
No psychiatrists. That's a rule.

732
00:37:11,497 --> 00:37:14,160
You make the rules, don't
you? You're his guardian.

733
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:18,803
Bruce's father gave me
very firm orders was him

734
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:20,438
and his missus to die.

735
00:37:20,472 --> 00:37:21,806
Now, I will raise

736
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,208
the boy the way his father
told me to raise him.

737
00:37:24,243 --> 00:37:27,111
Which is how?

738
00:37:27,146 --> 00:37:31,449
Trust him to choose his own course.

739
00:37:31,483 --> 00:37:35,119
He's, after all, a Wayne.

740
00:37:35,154 --> 00:37:38,256
Sounds like a recipe for disaster.

741
00:37:39,525 --> 00:37:41,259
What do you want me to do?

742
00:37:41,294 --> 00:37:42,927
He wants you to talk some sense into me.

743
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:46,064
Haven't I told you to stop creeping up

744
00:37:46,098 --> 00:37:47,832
on people like that
before? It's bloody rude!

745
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:52,304
All right, then, Bruce.

746
00:37:52,338 --> 00:37:54,539
Talk to me.

747
00:37:54,573 --> 00:37:56,174
I'm perfectly fine.

748
00:37:56,208 --> 00:37:58,009
Alfred's a worrywart.

749
00:37:59,045 --> 00:38:00,912
What did you do to your hand?

750
00:38:03,616 --> 00:38:05,583
I burned it.

751
00:38:05,618 --> 00:38:07,619
Listen to me, Bruce.

752
00:38:08,921 --> 00:38:10,922
You've been through a terrible experience.

753
00:38:12,391 --> 00:38:14,359
Talking to someone can be very helpful.

754
00:38:14,393 --> 00:38:16,595
You must have seen
terrible things in the war.

755
00:38:16,629 --> 00:38:19,731
<i>Does it... does it help you
to talk about what you saw?</i>

756
00:38:21,067 --> 00:38:23,034
Yes. A little.

757
00:38:23,069 --> 00:38:25,537
You're not a very good liar.

758
00:38:25,571 --> 00:38:29,474
- Bruce, you're hurting yourself.
- I'm testing myself.

759
00:38:29,508 --> 00:38:32,010
Different, but I appreciate your concern.

760
00:38:37,817 --> 00:38:40,819
I've been following your
adventures in the newspapers.

761
00:38:40,853 --> 00:38:44,089
I feel very sorry for
all those poor children.

762
00:38:44,123 --> 00:38:46,124
Me, too.

763
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:48,827
I'll give you some money to give to them.

764
00:38:48,861 --> 00:38:50,795
I'm afraid it doesn't work that way, Bruce.

765
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:53,331
What way does it work?

766
00:38:53,366 --> 00:38:55,433
Those children need
someone who cares for them,

767
00:38:55,468 --> 00:38:58,670
like you have right here.

768
00:39:00,006 --> 00:39:02,240
Money won't buy that.

769
00:39:02,275 --> 00:39:04,943
There must be something I can do.

770
00:39:04,977 --> 00:39:07,579
What about clothes?

771
00:39:07,613 --> 00:39:09,681
They all looked awfully ragged.

772
00:39:11,284 --> 00:39:13,351
They did, didn't they?

773
00:39:17,156 --> 00:39:19,191
(indistinct voice over
P.A., phones ringing)

774
00:39:19,225 --> 00:39:21,193
After all this?

775
00:39:21,227 --> 00:39:23,195
- You're sending us upstate?
- Selina...

776
00:39:23,229 --> 00:39:25,764
Cat.

777
00:39:25,798 --> 00:39:29,434
Cat, even if you didn't have
outstanding warrants, you're 13.

778
00:39:29,468 --> 00:39:31,436
No parents or guardians.

779
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:33,638
That's not true. I have a mom.

780
00:39:33,673 --> 00:39:36,007
- Says here she's deceased.
- That's not true.

781
00:39:36,042 --> 00:39:39,845
- She's alive... someplace.
- Be that as it may,

782
00:39:39,879 --> 00:39:42,480
we're not allowed to put
you back on the street.

783
00:39:42,515 --> 00:39:45,550
- It's for your own well-being.
- (laughs)

784
00:39:45,585 --> 00:39:47,285
Have you been there? Upstate?

785
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,987
- Yes.
- Then you know.

786
00:39:49,021 --> 00:39:50,822
You know.

787
00:39:52,158 --> 00:39:54,125
Go get Detective James Gordon.

788
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,861
He works here.

789
00:39:55,895 --> 00:39:58,029
Cat...

790
00:39:58,064 --> 00:40:00,832
the police are very busy people.

791
00:40:00,867 --> 00:40:02,834
- (mutters)
- Go get him...

792
00:40:02,869 --> 00:40:04,836
or...

793
00:40:04,871 --> 00:40:06,738
I'll say you touched me.

794
00:40:06,772 --> 00:40:09,007
Excuse me?

795
00:40:09,041 --> 00:40:11,009
James Gordon.

796
00:40:11,043 --> 00:40:13,311
I'm gonna scream in about three seconds.

797
00:40:23,723 --> 00:40:26,258
(rain falling, thunder rumbling)

798
00:40:35,134 --> 00:40:37,169
(cell phone ringing)

799
00:40:40,573 --> 00:40:42,541
Hello.

800
00:40:42,575 --> 00:40:45,877
Yes, this is he.

801
00:40:45,912 --> 00:40:48,547
Well... I'm looking at your son

802
00:40:48,581 --> 00:40:50,348
right now, and...

803
00:40:50,383 --> 00:40:52,384
he doesn't look good.

804
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:56,721
Madam, I assure you, your son
is not trying to trick you.

805
00:40:56,756 --> 00:41:00,459
Oh, he will die a
horrible death unless he...

806
00:41:00,493 --> 00:41:04,729
No, no. No, really truly, he isn't joking.

807
00:41:04,764 --> 00:41:06,732
<i>I'm not joking.</i>

808
00:41:06,766 --> 00:41:10,435
I will poke his eyeballs out, and...

809
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:13,138
How can you say that?
You saw the video I sent.

810
00:41:13,172 --> 00:41:14,606
I'm not lying. (laughs)

811
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,043
Madam, Madam, c-calm yourself.

812
00:41:18,077 --> 00:41:21,113
If $10,000 is too much, I'm sure we can...

813
00:41:21,147 --> 00:41:23,615
Hello? Hello?

814
00:41:29,322 --> 00:41:31,456
Well, that's disappointing.

815
00:41:33,126 --> 00:41:35,293
She didn't believe me.

816
00:41:35,328 --> 00:41:37,396
(whimpering)

817
00:41:38,431 --> 00:41:40,632
You must be quite the scamp.

818
00:41:45,271 --> 00:41:47,272
I got it.

819
00:41:47,306 --> 00:41:49,274
Hello again, young lady.

820
00:41:49,308 --> 00:41:52,310
- How can I help you?
- We need to talk.

821
00:41:52,345 --> 00:41:54,813
So, now you want to talk, huh?

822
00:41:54,847 --> 00:41:57,482
Okay. It's all right.

823
00:41:57,517 --> 00:41:58,917
Thanks.

824
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,088
- Selina is it?
- Cat.

825
00:42:03,122 --> 00:42:05,090
Cat.

826
00:42:05,124 --> 00:42:06,525
You Macky's friend?

827
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,994
Yeah, I know Macky.

828
00:42:09,028 --> 00:42:12,464
Those bastards nearly got you twice, huh?

829
00:42:12,498 --> 00:42:14,666
You're quite a survivor.

830
00:42:14,701 --> 00:42:16,968
You have no idea.

831
00:42:22,075 --> 00:42:24,042
Suppose I had something

832
00:42:24,077 --> 00:42:26,678
you really, really wanted.

833
00:42:26,713 --> 00:42:28,981
If I gave it to you,

834
00:42:29,015 --> 00:42:30,716
could you get me out of here?

835
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,017
What do you got?

836
00:42:32,051 --> 00:42:33,819
I've been watching you.

837
00:42:34,854 --> 00:42:36,321
You're a friend of the boy.

838
00:42:36,356 --> 00:42:38,323
You're not like the rest of these crooks.

839
00:42:44,664 --> 00:42:47,733
The boy? Bruce?

840
00:42:49,335 --> 00:42:51,203
What do you mean, you've been watching me?

841
00:42:51,237 --> 00:42:53,972
That Mario Pepper guy was a patsy, huh?

842
00:42:54,007 --> 00:42:56,341
What makes you say that?

843
00:42:56,376 --> 00:42:58,577
Could you? Could you get me out?

844
00:42:59,612 --> 00:43:01,580
It's possible.

845
00:43:04,717 --> 00:43:07,152
I saw who really killed the Waynes.

846
00:43:07,186 --> 00:43:09,442
Saw him clear as day.

847
00:43:11,824 --> 00:43:14,202
