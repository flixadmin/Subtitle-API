1
00:00:01,046 --> 00:00:02,890
Previously on Gotham...

2
00:00:02,893 --> 00:00:05,500
Jim, meet my daughter, Sofia.

3
00:00:05,503 --> 00:00:07,217
Do you ever think about
walking away from it all?

4
00:00:07,219 --> 00:00:08,351
Sometimes.

5
00:00:09,948 --> 00:00:11,581
This drawing depicts a man

6
00:00:11,584 --> 00:00:14,091
being healed by water.

7
00:00:14,094 --> 00:00:16,339
That's Ra's al Ghul.

8
00:00:16,341 --> 00:00:18,795
He wants the knife.

9
00:00:18,798 --> 00:00:21,577
Opening bid will begin at $50,000.

10
00:00:21,579 --> 00:00:23,746
A hundred thousand dollars.

11
00:00:23,748 --> 00:00:25,359
$2 million!

12
00:00:26,393 --> 00:00:28,518
Sold to Mr. Bruce Wayne!

13
00:00:30,522 --> 00:00:31,721
I guess you could say

14
00:00:31,723 --> 00:00:33,055
I'm your number one fan.

15
00:00:33,057 --> 00:00:35,358
What's black and white and red all over?

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,226
Zebra with a gaping hole.

17
00:00:37,228 --> 00:00:39,896
I think something is
wrong with your brain, Ed.

18
00:00:39,898 --> 00:00:41,898
Gordon, you got a visitor.

19
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,033
- You shouldn't have come back here.
- I'm a Falcone.

20
00:00:44,035 --> 00:00:46,860
You came looking for a gangster;
that's exactly what you found.

21
00:00:46,863 --> 00:00:49,238
That knife is the key

22
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,239
to everything.

23
00:00:52,665 --> 00:00:54,777
Well, not everything.

25
00:01:04,656 --> 00:01:06,295
Mmm...

26
00:01:06,298 --> 00:01:07,623
Beautiful.

27
00:01:07,625 --> 00:01:09,258
And you bought this at auction?

28
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,127
Supposedly, it was the embalming knife

29
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:13,296
of the first century Mesopotamian king.

30
00:01:13,298 --> 00:01:14,931
- Balahsi.
- Ah.

31
00:01:14,933 --> 00:01:17,733
And what is it that you
want of me, Mr. Wayne?

32
00:01:17,735 --> 00:01:19,469
Anything you can tell me, Dr. Winthrop.

33
00:01:19,471 --> 00:01:21,504
I want to know exactly
what it is I bought.

34
00:01:21,506 --> 00:01:23,272
Perhaps you should have considered that

35
00:01:23,274 --> 00:01:25,274
before you dropped $2
million on it, shouldn't you?

36
00:01:25,276 --> 00:01:27,143
Leave it with me overnight.

37
00:01:28,947 --> 00:01:30,913
I'm back.

38
00:01:30,915 --> 00:01:33,316
Man, you really need

39
00:01:33,318 --> 00:01:34,617
to clean that room.

40
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:36,649
My delightful grandson.

41
00:01:36,652 --> 00:01:37,696
I have access

42
00:01:37,699 --> 00:01:40,189
to the very clean
historical records room

43
00:01:40,191 --> 00:01:42,196
at Gotham Central Library,

44
00:01:42,199 --> 00:01:44,299
and he uses it for his homework.

45
00:01:44,302 --> 00:01:46,338
Oh, Alex, let me introduce you.

46
00:01:46,341 --> 00:01:48,966
Mr. Bruce Wayne and his guardian,

47
00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:51,200
- Alfred Pennyworth.
- What's up?

48
00:01:52,586 --> 00:01:53,585
Whoa.

49
00:01:53,588 --> 00:01:55,421
Where'd that come from?

50
00:01:55,424 --> 00:01:58,025
That cuneiform is
definitely pre-Phoenician.

51
00:01:58,028 --> 00:02:00,486
Alex is an avid student

52
00:02:00,489 --> 00:02:02,979
of history, and sometimes assists me.

53
00:02:02,981 --> 00:02:05,147
A word, Master Bruce.

54
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:07,183
Now, it's all very well

55
00:02:07,185 --> 00:02:09,417
involving that old
geezer, but a young man?

56
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,214
Just you remember
who's after that knife.

57
00:02:11,217 --> 00:02:12,388
What's so important about it

58
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,626
that Ra's al Ghul wants it
so badly? We need to know.

59
00:02:16,628 --> 00:02:18,494
Dr. Winthrop.

60
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,162
Alex.

61
00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:24,500
I have to ask you to keep
this matter between us.

62
00:02:24,502 --> 00:02:25,902
Of course.

63
00:02:25,904 --> 00:02:28,004
Yeah. Cool.

64
00:02:28,006 --> 00:02:29,672
I mean...

65
00:02:29,674 --> 00:02:31,340
yes, Mr. Wayne.

66
00:02:31,342 --> 00:02:33,175
I'll check back tomorrow.

67
00:02:33,178 --> 00:02:35,012
Until then.

68
00:02:40,485 --> 00:02:42,318
No!

69
00:02:43,988 --> 00:02:46,188
Come on, Ed, come on.

70
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,057
You can do it.

71
00:02:49,761 --> 00:02:51,761
This has to be...

72
00:02:51,763 --> 00:02:54,096
the perfect... riddle.

73
00:02:54,098 --> 00:02:55,598
No!

74
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:03,203
Yes.

75
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:04,774
Yes.

76
00:03:05,843 --> 00:03:08,335
Yes! Yes!

77
00:03:11,082 --> 00:03:12,708
You...

78
00:03:21,292 --> 00:03:24,226
Tomorrow night, Oswald,

79
00:03:24,228 --> 00:03:26,854
is the night you die.

80
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:42,177
Alex, bring me the Palmerian Codex.

81
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:47,216
Ah.

82
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,756
Ah.

83
00:03:53,758 --> 00:03:55,700
What is it?

84
00:04:00,398 --> 00:04:03,232
"he who rises from the waters,

85
00:04:03,234 --> 00:04:05,334
whom death shall not touch.

86
00:04:05,336 --> 00:04:07,336
With this sacred blade,

87
00:04:07,338 --> 00:04:09,929
his final savage destiny

88
00:04:09,932 --> 00:04:11,807
shall be fulfilled.

89
00:04:11,809 --> 00:04:13,676
The earth will quake.

90
00:04:13,678 --> 00:04:15,578
Blood will flow.

91
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,513
All tremble...

92
00:04:18,783 --> 00:04:20,874
before the Demon's Head."

93
00:04:20,877 --> 00:04:23,519
What's the Demon's Head?

94
00:04:23,521 --> 00:04:27,323
Not what, my boy. Who.

95
00:04:27,325 --> 00:04:30,222
There is a legend in
the time of this knife

96
00:04:30,225 --> 00:04:32,495
of a man who could not die.

97
00:04:32,497 --> 00:04:34,630
Or who died but was reborn.

98
00:04:34,632 --> 00:04:37,099
Have you ever in your
reading come across the name,

99
00:04:37,101 --> 00:04:38,707
Ra's al Ghul?

100
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,770
He was a warlord.

101
00:04:40,772 --> 00:04:44,306
But those guys always had
stories invented about them.

102
00:04:44,308 --> 00:04:45,708
They're just stories.

103
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,878
My boy, people believe in these stories.

104
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,798
They kill for them.

105
00:04:52,316 --> 00:04:54,550
I think Bruce Wayne has stumbled across

106
00:04:54,552 --> 00:04:57,386
something much more
complex than he imagined,

107
00:04:57,388 --> 00:04:59,722
and infinitely more dangerous.

108
00:05:03,127 --> 00:05:05,494
No one should be here.

109
00:05:05,496 --> 00:05:08,464
Here. Take this into my office.

110
00:05:08,466 --> 00:05:09,665
Stay quiet.

111
00:05:09,667 --> 00:05:11,067
Quickly.

112
00:05:17,542 --> 00:05:19,809
Dr. Niles Winthrop. What a pleasure.

113
00:05:19,811 --> 00:05:22,011
Who are you?

114
00:05:22,013 --> 00:05:23,846
Museum's closed.

115
00:05:23,848 --> 00:05:25,548
How did you get past the guard?

116
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,349
My apologies.

117
00:05:27,351 --> 00:05:29,351
But my business is pressing.

118
00:05:29,353 --> 00:05:32,067
Greek vase, second century.

119
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,154
Oh.

120
00:05:34,726 --> 00:05:37,827
This was made by a forger in
Marrakesh in the 15th century.

121
00:05:37,829 --> 00:05:41,430
He had some talent, but
told the most obscene jokes.

122
00:05:42,366 --> 00:05:45,310
Tell me who you are, or
I shall call the police.

123
00:05:45,313 --> 00:05:47,002
I'm looking for a knife

124
00:05:47,004 --> 00:05:49,605
Bruce Wayne brought you earlier today.

125
00:05:49,607 --> 00:05:52,041
I don't know what you mean.

126
00:05:52,043 --> 00:05:56,779
Hmm. The best liar I ever
met ran a brothel in Shanghai.

127
00:05:56,781 --> 00:05:59,973
Her quite considerable
gift was that you knew

128
00:05:59,976 --> 00:06:01,437
she was lying but didn't care,

129
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,754
you so badly wanted to believe her.

130
00:06:06,023 --> 00:06:09,925
You, Dr. Winthrop, are a terrible liar.

131
00:06:12,045 --> 00:06:13,729
Where's the knife?

132
00:06:16,425 --> 00:06:19,201
Oh, the-the police, they're coming.

133
00:06:19,203 --> 00:06:21,871
I imagine they are.

134

135
00:06:56,514 --> 00:06:58,179
End of crime, my ass.

136
00:06:58,182 --> 00:07:00,659
Harper? Where's Bullock?

137
00:07:00,662 --> 00:07:02,003
He asked me to fill in.

138
00:07:02,006 --> 00:07:04,747
He took a sabbatical for a few days.

139
00:07:04,749 --> 00:07:07,118
You babysitting me?

140
00:07:07,121 --> 00:07:08,818
Do you need babysitting?

141
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,550
What do we got?

142
00:07:10,553 --> 00:07:12,097
Dr. Niles Winthrop.

143
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,994
Curator of antiquities.

144
00:07:13,997 --> 00:07:15,930
Looks like somebody snapped his neck.

145
00:07:15,933 --> 00:07:17,593
No witnesses, of course.

146
00:07:17,595 --> 00:07:19,161
Fire alarm triggered security.

147
00:07:19,163 --> 00:07:21,759
Maybe the dead guy pulled
it right before the...

148
00:07:21,762 --> 00:07:24,133
Yeah, thanks. Anything else?

149
00:07:24,135 --> 00:07:25,768
Yes, actually.

150
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,543
According to Professor
Von Dead's logbook,

151
00:07:28,546 --> 00:07:29,872
the last person who visited him...

152
00:07:29,874 --> 00:07:31,602
I'm talking just yesterday afternoon...

153
00:07:31,605 --> 00:07:33,375
Bruce Wayne.

154
00:07:33,377 --> 00:07:35,544
It's all right. Let him in.

155
00:07:37,777 --> 00:07:39,114
Detective Gordon.

156
00:07:39,116 --> 00:07:40,282
What...

157
00:07:44,722 --> 00:07:46,655
What happened?

158
00:07:46,657 --> 00:07:49,058
We were thinking we would
ask you the same thing.

159
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,861
You met with Dr. Winthrop
just yesterday, correct?

160
00:07:51,863 --> 00:07:53,996
I, um...

161
00:07:53,998 --> 00:07:56,365
I-I bought an old knife at auction.

162
00:07:56,367 --> 00:07:59,001
Dr. Winthrop agreed
to examine it for me.

163
00:07:59,003 --> 00:08:00,754
I was coming by

164
00:08:00,757 --> 00:08:02,530
to check on his progress.

165
00:08:02,533 --> 00:08:04,673
- When was he killed?
- According to the fire alarm,

166
00:08:04,675 --> 00:08:06,041
just past midnight.

167
00:08:06,043 --> 00:08:08,699
Whoever did it must have
slipped past security.

168
00:08:08,702 --> 00:08:10,701
His grandson.

169
00:08:10,704 --> 00:08:12,595
Alex. He's my age, a little bit younger.

170
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:14,984
- Have you talked to him?
- No one's seen any kid.

171
00:08:14,986 --> 00:08:16,151
I'll get on it.

172
00:08:21,692 --> 00:08:23,726
Where's the knife?

173
00:08:23,728 --> 00:08:26,154
Alfred was right... I
shouldn't have left it.

174
00:08:26,157 --> 00:08:28,931
Bruce, slow down.

175
00:08:28,933 --> 00:08:30,099
What's this knife?

176
00:08:30,101 --> 00:08:31,861
You think someone would
actually kill for it?

177
00:08:33,504 --> 00:08:36,089
Detective Gordon, I'll tell
you what you want to know,

178
00:08:36,092 --> 00:08:38,420
but all I ask is that
you let me come along.

179
00:08:38,423 --> 00:08:40,604
If this is because of the
knife, then I'm responsible.

180
00:08:40,607 --> 00:08:41,873
Bruce, a man is dead.

181
00:08:41,876 --> 00:08:43,529
A child is potentially missing.

182
00:08:43,532 --> 00:08:45,114
This is not time to play detective.

183
00:08:45,116 --> 00:08:46,548
What do you know?

184
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,784
What's so special about this knife?

185
00:08:48,786 --> 00:08:52,721
As far as I know, it's
just an old knife. But...

186
00:08:52,723 --> 00:08:55,024
I paid a great deal for it,
and there was another bidder,

187
00:08:55,026 --> 00:08:56,258
a very aggressive one.

188
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,927
Barbara Kean.

189
00:08:59,797 --> 00:09:01,697
Right.

190
00:09:01,699 --> 00:09:04,618
Well, Harper will
track down the grandson.

191
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:06,415
I'll deal with Barbara.

192
00:09:06,418 --> 00:09:07,803
You go home.

193

welcome to Gotham.

221

Mr. Cobblepot, it's a
pleasure to meet you.

Thank you

225
00:11:00,144 --> 00:11:01,789
for coming to see me.

226
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,691
I learned from my father,

227
00:11:03,693 --> 00:11:05,960
when the king of Gotham
summons you, you come.

228
00:11:05,962 --> 00:11:07,528
And how is Carmine?

229
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,730
Can we hope to see him sometime soon?

230
00:11:11,122 --> 00:11:13,367
Shall we just address
the elephant in the room?

231
00:11:13,369 --> 00:11:15,033
By all means.

232
00:11:15,036 --> 00:11:16,279
My father's

233
00:11:16,282 --> 00:11:19,525
illegal businesses
hold no interest for me.

234
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:22,262
I'm here because the Falcone
family has a number of charities

235
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:23,697
that need my attention.

236
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,379
And you can only provide that attention

237
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:27,771
by being here personally... in my city.

238
00:11:27,774 --> 00:11:29,085
I understand your concern...

239
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:30,585
Oh, do you?

240
00:11:32,422 --> 00:11:36,657
But I assure you... it's unfounded.

241
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:40,728
You know, your father
taught me many things.

242
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,999
Among them was to nurture
a healthy paranoia.

243
00:11:45,001 --> 00:11:47,502
For example, when I took over,

244
00:11:47,504 --> 00:11:50,061
some of his old capos went underground.

245
00:11:50,064 --> 00:11:54,385
Now, perhaps they've vanished for good,

246
00:11:54,388 --> 00:11:56,755
or perhaps they're waiting
for a Falcone to return

247
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,224
to lead the rebellion.

248
00:11:58,227 --> 00:12:00,518
Uh... Who knows?

249
00:12:01,997 --> 00:12:05,803
But I hear your father's voice

250
00:12:05,806 --> 00:12:09,775
whispering in my ear.

251
00:12:09,778 --> 00:12:11,807
"Be careful."

252
00:12:15,031 --> 00:12:17,400
Now... I need to know

253
00:12:17,402 --> 00:12:19,502
that you are not on some fool's errand

254
00:12:19,504 --> 00:12:21,804
to rebuild your father's empire.

255
00:12:21,806 --> 00:12:24,473
Otherwise...

256
00:12:24,475 --> 00:12:26,542
I'm gonna stab you.

257
00:12:33,271 --> 00:12:36,018
I was 13 when my father
first sent me away.

258
00:12:37,488 --> 00:12:39,855
He said that Gotham was too dangerous.

259
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:42,725
This is my home.

260
00:12:42,727 --> 00:12:44,260
I wanted to come home.

261
00:12:44,262 --> 00:12:46,595
That's why I'm here.

262
00:12:46,597 --> 00:12:48,197

00:15:53,132 --> 00:15:54,683
scared.

337
00:15:54,685 --> 00:15:56,085
Where could he be?

338
00:15:56,087 --> 00:15:57,286
Think.

339
00:15:57,288 --> 00:15:58,887
I only met him for a second.

340
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:01,223
You want to play detective?
Now is your chance.

341
00:16:01,225 --> 00:16:03,392
What was he wearing? What
did he say? Give me anything.

342
00:16:03,394 --> 00:16:05,761
He... had on his school uniform.

343
00:16:05,763 --> 00:16:08,564
He just came from studying at...

344
00:16:08,566 --> 00:16:12,230
Gotham Central Library. His
grandfather had a room there.

345
00:16:12,233 --> 00:16:13,556
Alex has a key.

346
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:16,372
If he's hiding, he's made a
choice not to trust the cops.

347
00:16:16,374 --> 00:16:18,073
If I show up, he might run.

348
00:16:18,075 --> 00:16:21,210
He needs to see a
face he knows. Come on.

349
00:16:23,881 --> 00:16:25,748
Ed Nygma sent you?

350
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,650
The Edward Nygma?

351
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,771
Do it again.

352
00:16:33,873 --> 00:16:36,091
♪ My once friend Oswald, now my foe ♪

353
00:16:36,093 --> 00:16:38,427
♪ It's me, Ed, just so you know ♪

354
00:16:38,429 --> 00:16:40,500

355
00:16:40,503 --> 00:16:42,852

356
00:16:42,855 --> 00:16:45,134

357
00:16:45,136 --> 00:16:47,397
♪ At dusk we'll meet,

358
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,069
♪ We'll settle things,
unless you're scared. ♪

359
00:16:55,513 --> 00:16:57,446
What the hell was that?

360
00:16:57,448 --> 00:17:01,005
We should torture 'em, just get
'em to tell us where Nygma is.

361
00:17:01,008 --> 00:17:02,655
No, he just found us on the street.

362
00:17:02,665 --> 00:17:04,145
Well, that's exactly what you would say.

363
00:17:04,147 --> 00:17:06,155
Leave!

364
00:17:06,157 --> 00:17:09,692
That barmaid who kidnapped
Ed said he'd lost a step.

365
00:17:09,694 --> 00:17:12,327
Clearly, she was mistaken, he's
up to all of his old tricks.

366
00:17:12,329 --> 00:17:15,364
So, I'll meet him.

367
00:17:15,366 --> 00:17:18,100
You and your men will hide nearby.

368
00:17:18,102 --> 00:17:19,668
Attack when I say.

369
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:21,704
Do not kill Ed, though!

370
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,991
I want Victor to freeze him again.

371
00:17:23,994 --> 00:17:26,309
- Huh?
- Not you. The other Victor.

372
00:17:26,312 --> 00:17:27,609
Oh.

373
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:31,513
Earth meets sky, water flows, birds fly.

374
00:17:32,783 --> 00:17:34,783
Obviously, he means the pier.

375
00:17:34,785 --> 00:17:37,486
Gather your men.

376
00:17:37,488 --> 00:17:39,855
I want Ed Nygma.

377
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:42,702
Historical Records room?

378
00:17:42,705 --> 00:17:44,129
In the back.

379
00:18:00,661 --> 00:18:02,177
Alex?

380
00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:04,146
It's me, Bruce Wayne.

381
00:18:06,058 --> 00:18:08,325
You can come out. It's safe.

382
00:18:08,328 --> 00:18:10,421
Alex, please. I...

383
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:12,002
I just want to help you.

384
00:18:18,155 --> 00:18:21,323
Alex, this is Detective Gordon.

385
00:18:21,326 --> 00:18:22,492
You can trust him.

386
00:18:24,434 --> 00:18:26,468
Okay. Okay, all right.

387
00:18:32,576 --> 00:18:34,510
I'm so sorry.

388
00:18:36,614 --> 00:18:38,614
That-that-that man, he killed him.

389
00:18:38,616 --> 00:18:40,415
- He killed my grandfather.
- It was a man?

390
00:18:40,417 --> 00:18:42,217
- You saw his face?
- I only saw him

391
00:18:42,219 --> 00:18:43,828
from behind. It was the knife.

392
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,854
Did-did you know it was dangerous?

393
00:18:47,244 --> 00:18:48,624
No.

394
00:18:48,626 --> 00:18:50,125
I had no idea.

395
00:18:50,127 --> 00:18:52,580
Alex, we need to get
you down to the station.

396
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:55,346
I-I-I can't. That man,
he'll think I saw him.

397
00:18:55,349 --> 00:18:57,558
- He'll come after me.
- I will protect you.

398
00:18:57,561 --> 00:18:59,968
- I promise.
- He'll keep coming till he gets the knife.

399
00:19:01,983 --> 00:19:03,915
Alex, do you have the knife with you?

400
00:19:03,918 --> 00:19:05,541
No. I hid it.

401
00:19:11,782 --> 00:19:14,883
Take Alex and meet
me at the station. Go.

402
00:19:35,673 --> 00:19:38,841
Who sent you?

403
00:19:38,843 --> 00:19:40,843
Thanks for clearing that up.

404
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:55,290
Bruce? Run!

405
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:24,028
- Bruce Wayne call in?
- No. We released a citywide BOLO.

406
00:20:24,031 --> 00:20:25,464
What about that name I gave you?

407
00:20:25,467 --> 00:20:29,033
Zip. I tried Richard
Gull, Ralph Ghoul...

408
00:20:29,036 --> 00:20:31,438
Detective Gordon?

409
00:20:32,742 --> 00:20:34,942
Ra's al Ghul.

410
00:20:34,944 --> 00:20:37,878
Minister of Antiquities
attached to the consulate

411
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,713
of Nanda Parbat.

412
00:20:41,516 --> 00:20:43,616
Thanks for coming in.

413
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:45,885
Nanda Parbat, that's
in the Himalayas, right?

414
00:20:45,888 --> 00:20:47,207
Well done, Detective.

415
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:50,090
Few in your country have
even heard of our tiny nation.

416
00:20:51,445 --> 00:20:53,345
Why don't we speak in
my captain's office?

417
00:20:53,348 --> 00:20:54,863
A bit more private.

418
00:20:54,866 --> 00:20:57,231
Of course.

419
00:20:57,233 --> 00:20:58,522
I'll be with you in a minute.

420
00:20:58,525 --> 00:21:00,425
Thank you.

421
00:21:03,939 --> 00:21:05,739
I don't get it. This is the guy that

422
00:21:05,741 --> 00:21:07,933
you're looking at for murder?
Why does he just walk in?

423
00:21:07,936 --> 00:21:09,743
Barbara must have told him
we were looking for him.

424
00:21:09,745 --> 00:21:11,814
- Yeah, but...
- Two thugs at the library.

425
00:21:11,817 --> 00:21:13,250
If they're working for him,

426
00:21:13,253 --> 00:21:16,417
they would have told him
that we've contacted Alex.

427
00:21:16,419 --> 00:21:18,786
He could think that
Alex gave us the knife.

428
00:21:20,456 --> 00:21:22,156
I can use that.

429
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:28,248
Call Alfred Pennyworth, see
if he's heard from Bruce Wayne.

430
00:21:28,251 --> 00:21:29,984
Th-That thing bit me.

431
00:21:31,272 --> 00:21:33,206
- I need to get you to a hospital.
- No, no.

432
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:35,136
Then the police. Detective Gordon...

433
00:21:35,139 --> 00:21:36,972
No, I can't. I can't. They'll find me.

434
00:21:36,974 --> 00:21:39,675
I'm sorry.

435
00:21:39,677 --> 00:21:41,643
I'm scared.

436
00:21:43,647 --> 00:21:46,481
I don't know how you do it.

437
00:21:46,483 --> 00:21:50,074
You fought those men, and I...

438
00:21:50,077 --> 00:21:52,044
I just froze.

439
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,934
Same as when that man
killed my grandfather.

440
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:00,509
Fear is normal.

441
00:22:02,017 --> 00:22:05,986
In the alley, when my
parents were killed...

442
00:22:05,989 --> 00:22:09,991
I was terrified.

443
00:22:09,994 --> 00:22:12,079
I just stood there.

444
00:22:15,479 --> 00:22:17,767
There's nothing wrong with being afraid.

445
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:19,284
Once you realize it's normal,

446
00:22:19,287 --> 00:22:21,087
then you can put it in its place.

447
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,858
Then you can act.

448
00:22:25,616 --> 00:22:26,782
Fight back.

449
00:22:36,345 --> 00:22:40,069
I felt bad for you.

450
00:22:40,072 --> 00:22:42,772
When that happened to your parents.

451
00:22:42,774 --> 00:22:45,809
You were all the kids
at school talked about.

452
00:22:45,811 --> 00:22:48,578
What do they say?

453
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,881
That you live alone in a mansion.

454
00:22:50,883 --> 00:22:52,782
Don't go to school.

455
00:22:52,784 --> 00:22:54,951
Fly around in jets.

456
00:22:54,953 --> 00:22:57,287
They make you sound weird.

457
00:22:57,289 --> 00:22:58,955
Maybe I am.

458
00:22:58,957 --> 00:23:00,259
No.

459
00:23:00,262 --> 00:23:01,862
You're-you're cool.

460
00:23:01,865 --> 00:23:03,231
I'm weird.

461
00:23:05,329 --> 00:23:09,415
And you're a little weird, too, I guess,

462
00:23:09,418 --> 00:23:11,718
but...

463
00:23:11,721 --> 00:23:14,388
you're weirdly cool.

464
00:23:23,682 --> 00:23:25,541
I'll take you to the knife.

465
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:29,107
Can I get you anything?

466
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,419
Coffee?

467
00:23:30,422 --> 00:23:31,588
That won't be necessary.

468
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,023
I think you know why I'm here.

469
00:23:33,025 --> 00:23:34,457
Enlighten me, Minister.

470
00:23:34,459 --> 00:23:35,992
Barbara Kean,

471
00:23:35,995 --> 00:23:38,860
with whom you spoke, was acting
on behalf of my government

472
00:23:38,863 --> 00:23:41,195
to procure a certain property.

473
00:23:42,314 --> 00:23:45,749
Said property is the cultural
patrimony of my people.

474
00:23:45,752 --> 00:23:47,680
Why not bid on the knife yourself?

475
00:23:47,683 --> 00:23:49,940
There were competing claims.

476
00:23:49,942 --> 00:23:52,876
And if we'd bid officially,
alarms may have sound,

477
00:23:52,878 --> 00:23:56,713
and so it seemed
better to do it quietly.

478
00:23:56,715 --> 00:23:58,128
But...

479
00:23:58,131 --> 00:24:01,985
Ms. Kean... failed.

480
00:24:01,987 --> 00:24:04,387
And now, regrettably,

481
00:24:04,389 --> 00:24:06,658
I understand there's been a murder?

482
00:24:06,661 --> 00:24:08,358
Dr. Niles Winthrop,

483
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,460
curator at the Gotham
Natural History Museum.

484
00:24:10,462 --> 00:24:12,662
That's awful.

485
00:24:12,664 --> 00:24:15,182
But the reason I'm here, Detective,

486
00:24:15,185 --> 00:24:18,557
is to press my claim on
behalf of my government,

487
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,828
and entreat you to
return the knife to me.

488
00:24:21,831 --> 00:24:24,140
You say this knife is
important to your country,

489
00:24:24,142 --> 00:24:25,542
please explain.

490
00:24:25,544 --> 00:24:27,577
Hmm.

491
00:24:27,579 --> 00:24:30,981
There is an ancient
story amongst my people

492
00:24:30,983 --> 00:24:33,383
of a man...

493
00:24:33,385 --> 00:24:36,463
who could not die.

494
00:24:36,466 --> 00:24:39,066
In his time, he committed terrible acts,

495
00:24:39,069 --> 00:24:42,057
raised a great kingdom,

496
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,260
and then vanished.

497
00:24:44,262 --> 00:24:46,029
What happened to him?

498
00:24:46,031 --> 00:24:47,831
If the legend is to be believed,

499
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:50,197
he walked away from his
throne vowing that one day

500
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,197
he would return and
complete his destiny,

501
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,106
but that would require
a particular knife.

502
00:24:56,108 --> 00:24:58,074
This knife.

503
00:24:58,076 --> 00:25:01,244
A story, as I said.

504
00:25:01,246 --> 00:25:03,580
But to my people...

505
00:25:03,582 --> 00:25:06,249
very meaningful.

506
00:25:07,768 --> 00:25:10,068
I hope that satisfies your curiosity.

507
00:25:10,071 --> 00:25:12,288
Some.

508
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:15,332
But you see, Minister,

509
00:25:15,335 --> 00:25:18,670
my chief concern,

510
00:25:18,673 --> 00:25:21,907
is there's a boy, the
grandson of the curator.

511
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:24,868
He's being hunted.

512
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:27,270
Now, perhaps that's
because of the knife.

513
00:25:27,272 --> 00:25:30,076
Or perhaps the killer thinks

514
00:25:30,079 --> 00:25:33,476
he saw something.

515
00:25:33,478 --> 00:25:35,145
Did he?

516
00:25:35,147 --> 00:25:37,747
No.

517
00:25:37,749 --> 00:25:40,705
Well, then he's safe.

518
00:25:40,708 --> 00:25:41,763
Yes, but you see,

519
00:25:41,766 --> 00:25:43,632
I would have to know that for certain,

520
00:25:43,635 --> 00:25:46,221
before I would do anything
that might affect the case,

521
00:25:46,224 --> 00:25:47,824
such as release the knife.

522
00:25:49,113 --> 00:25:52,448
May I see the knife, Detective?

523
00:25:52,451 --> 00:25:55,396
It would so set my mind at ease.

524
00:26:01,006 --> 00:26:02,806
Hey.

525
00:26:02,808 --> 00:26:04,340
Where the bloody hell is Gordon?!

526
00:26:04,342 --> 00:26:05,672
Gordon. Incoming.

527
00:26:05,675 --> 00:26:07,942
Gordon! Where the hell is Bruce?

528
00:26:07,945 --> 00:26:09,311
You...

529
00:26:09,314 --> 00:26:10,480
Alfred!

530
00:26:10,482 --> 00:26:11,848
- Wait, wait, wait!
- Back off!

531
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:13,016
Take your hands off of me.

532
00:26:13,019 --> 00:26:14,686
You don't know what you got in there!

533
00:26:14,689 --> 00:26:16,488
I'm starting to, but
you are not helping.

534
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:17,791
I need you to calm down.

535
00:26:17,794 --> 00:26:19,126
Let me finish talking to him.

536
00:26:19,129 --> 00:26:20,805
- Gordon.
- Not now.

537
00:26:20,808 --> 00:26:22,359
Gordon!

538
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,018
He's bloody vanished.

539
00:26:28,021 --> 00:26:30,467
He knows we don't have the knife.

540
00:26:30,469 --> 00:26:32,769
We have to find Bruce.

541
00:26:32,771 --> 00:26:34,056
Donna Falcone.

542
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,189
Do not call me that.

543
00:26:35,192 --> 00:26:37,392
- You got to hear us out.
- No, I don't.

544
00:26:37,395 --> 00:26:38,697
I didn't invite you here.

545
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,099
We're not having this meeting.

546
00:26:40,102 --> 00:26:41,669
Now, I'm gonna ask you, please,

547
00:26:41,672 --> 00:26:43,171
politely, to leave.

548
00:26:43,174 --> 00:26:45,117
We served your father for years.

549
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:47,286
When Penguin took over,
we had to go underground.

550
00:26:47,288 --> 00:26:48,588
Then we heard a Falcone

551
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,298
was back in Gotham.

552
00:26:50,301 --> 00:26:51,800
We knew it was time.

553
00:26:51,803 --> 00:26:54,359
Did you ignore my father
like you're ignoring me?

554
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:56,195
I just told you to leave.

555
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,385
Just tell us when your
father's coming back

556
00:26:58,388 --> 00:26:59,872
to put that Penguin in his place.

557
00:26:59,875 --> 00:27:02,783
Please understand me, my
father is not coming back.

558
00:27:02,786 --> 00:27:04,070
This is Penguin's city.

559
00:27:04,072 --> 00:27:06,354
And I want you to leave before
he finds out you're here...

560
00:27:06,357 --> 00:27:08,333
Too late, I'm afraid.

561
00:27:10,144 --> 00:27:11,944
Victor, how many graves did you dig?

562
00:27:11,946 --> 00:27:13,479
Two.

563
00:27:13,481 --> 00:27:14,814
But they're roomy.

564
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,500
And there we are.

565
00:27:36,502 --> 00:27:37,601
My paranoia

566
00:27:37,603 --> 00:27:39,070
is put to rest.

567
00:27:39,072 --> 00:27:41,472
Whew.

568
00:27:41,474 --> 00:27:43,938
You used me.

569
00:27:48,281 --> 00:27:50,757
You had me come to your club.

570
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,984
You knew word would get out,
that my father's loyalists

571
00:27:52,986 --> 00:27:54,352
would find me.

572
00:27:54,354 --> 00:27:56,487
I was the worm on your hook.

573
00:27:58,591 --> 00:28:01,659
With one difference, my dear.

574
00:28:01,661 --> 00:28:04,428
The worm is usually eaten.

575
00:28:04,430 --> 00:28:06,130
So you trust me now?

576
00:28:06,132 --> 00:28:07,798
You're alive, aren't you?

577
00:28:11,137 --> 00:28:12,970
I would plant roses...

578
00:28:12,972 --> 00:28:14,972
they cover up the smell.

579
00:28:16,509 --> 00:28:19,844
My father wouldn't
have killed those men.

580
00:28:21,189 --> 00:28:23,381
He would have invited me
to his club, as you did,

581
00:28:23,383 --> 00:28:24,782
but then gone further.

582
00:28:24,784 --> 00:28:27,018
He would have invited me to dinners.

583
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:28,786
Had us seen in public.

584
00:28:28,788 --> 00:28:32,890
Sent the message that
the old order supports me.

585
00:28:32,892 --> 00:28:36,360
And those men you killed
would have pledged you loyalty.

586
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,964
Now they're fertilizer.

587
00:28:39,966 --> 00:28:43,634
See, my father, he knew how to
build on the strength of others.

588
00:28:43,636 --> 00:28:46,975
But it's your city.

589
00:28:54,981 --> 00:28:57,381
New times, new methods.

590
00:29:11,364 --> 00:29:13,497
There was an ancient
Sumerian jewelry box here.

591
00:29:13,499 --> 00:29:15,099
I had just replaced it.

592
00:29:15,101 --> 00:29:17,535
Hiding in plain sight.

593
00:29:17,537 --> 00:29:20,237
Good thinking.

594
00:29:20,239 --> 00:29:24,842
Bruce, there's a
legend about this knife.

595
00:29:25,989 --> 00:29:29,457
That terrible things
happen because of it.

596
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:33,584
But what if it's not just a legend?

597
00:29:33,586 --> 00:29:36,420
My grandfather is dead.

598
00:29:36,422 --> 00:29:38,522
The man that killed him,

599
00:29:38,524 --> 00:29:40,925
he can't have this.

600
00:29:40,927 --> 00:29:43,027
I won't let him.

601
00:29:43,029 --> 00:29:44,250
I promise.

602
00:29:46,199 --> 00:29:47,800
We have to get out of here.

603
00:29:47,803 --> 00:29:49,169
Run. Run.

604
00:30:39,285 --> 00:30:41,619
The Nanda Parbat consulate's
giving us the runaround,

605
00:30:41,621 --> 00:30:43,452
and we can't get in
there without a warrant.

606
00:30:43,455 --> 00:30:44,822
Bruce still hasn't called you?

607
00:30:44,824 --> 00:30:47,152
No. And what the bloody
hell were you doing

608
00:30:47,155 --> 00:30:48,789
letting him tag along with
some murder investigation

609
00:30:48,791 --> 00:30:50,861
- in the first place, eh?
- No, no, no.

610
00:30:50,863 --> 00:30:52,263
You do not get to lecture me

611
00:30:52,265 --> 00:30:54,147
about a lack of honesty and openness.

612
00:30:54,158 --> 00:30:56,418
You and Bruce have been
up to something for weeks.

613
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:59,670
What have you two
gotten yourselves into?

614
00:30:59,672 --> 00:31:02,217
Damn it, Alfred. I'm on your side.

615
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,500
Well, that may be, mate,
but whatever Master Bruce

616
00:31:04,503 --> 00:31:07,186
decides to tell you is
his decision, isn't it?

617
00:31:08,347 --> 00:31:09,520
You are his guardian.

618
00:31:09,523 --> 00:31:11,281
You are allowed to violate his privacy

619
00:31:11,284 --> 00:31:12,783
if it is gonna keep him out of danger.

620
00:31:12,785 --> 00:31:14,485
Stick to the point.

621
00:31:14,487 --> 00:31:17,188
What are you doing to find my boy?

622
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:19,191
What can I do? Huh?

623
00:31:19,194 --> 00:31:21,595
I have every cop in the city on alert,

624
00:31:21,598 --> 00:31:24,161
but as long as Ra's al Ghul
thinks he has that knife,

625
00:31:24,163 --> 00:31:26,106
- his life is in danger.
- Yeah, right, and what about

626
00:31:26,108 --> 00:31:27,815
the other boy? Did he tell
you where he put the knife?

627
00:31:27,817 --> 00:31:30,816
No. But I have to assume
Bruce is taking him to get it.

628
00:31:30,819 --> 00:31:32,252
Right.

629
00:31:34,754 --> 00:31:36,954
Well, there's got to be a
clue or something inside here.

630
00:31:39,422 --> 00:31:41,188
What?

631
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:43,480
- You stay here.
- What?

632
00:31:43,482 --> 00:31:45,849
The access I gave you depended on trust.

633
00:31:45,851 --> 00:31:48,727
If you can't be honest with
me, there's nothing I can do.

634
00:31:49,413 --> 00:31:51,246
Harper.

635
00:31:51,249 --> 00:31:53,590
If Mr. Pennyworth tries to leave,

636
00:31:53,593 --> 00:31:55,188
arrest him.

637
00:31:55,191 --> 00:31:56,523
On what charge?

638
00:31:56,526 --> 00:31:58,326
She'll think of something.

639
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:24,975
I went to the pier.

640
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,859
I waited.

641
00:32:27,861 --> 00:32:29,528
Ed didn't show.

642
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:31,596
He...

643
00:32:31,598 --> 00:32:34,332
Oh, just get on with it.

644
00:32:34,334 --> 00:32:36,334

just torture them now?

660
00:33:03,197 --> 00:33:04,462
Why not?

661
00:33:05,499 --> 00:33:07,399
W-Wait, man.

662
00:33:31,358 --> 00:33:32,724
Run.

663
00:33:41,168 --> 00:33:42,601
Bruce?

664
00:33:44,338 --> 00:33:45,937
Down!

665
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:53,419
Let's go.

666
00:33:53,523 --> 00:33:54,822
Let's go.

667
00:34:00,387 --> 00:34:02,954
Take him. Take him, go!

668
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:06,275
Aah!

669
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:08,793
Get off of me!

670
00:35:06,653 --> 00:35:08,763
It's time you tell me what's going on.

671
00:35:08,766 --> 00:35:10,667
What is so important about this knife?

672
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,524
Why are people dying for it?

673
00:35:12,526 --> 00:35:14,859
Excellent question, Detective.

674
00:35:14,861 --> 00:35:17,295
And you shall have your answer soon.

675
00:35:17,297 --> 00:35:21,229
Just give me the knife,
and I will release the boy.

676
00:35:21,232 --> 00:35:22,798
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

677
00:35:26,773 --> 00:35:28,440
Of course.

678
00:35:28,442 --> 00:35:31,509
Bruce, hand me the knife.

679
00:35:34,214 --> 00:35:35,714
Bruce.

680
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,215
Hand me the knife.

681
00:35:37,217 --> 00:35:38,717
You don't understand.

682
00:35:39,852 --> 00:35:41,553
He killed Alfred.

683
00:35:41,555 --> 00:35:43,488
And then brought him back to life.

684
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:46,791
And Alex's grandfather
was afraid of this knife.

685
00:35:46,793 --> 00:35:49,661
I can't give it to him.

686
00:35:49,663 --> 00:35:52,330
If we don't hand it
over now, Alex is dead.

687
00:35:52,332 --> 00:35:54,566
- That is all that matters.
- No!

688
00:35:54,568 --> 00:35:56,201
You don't know who he is.

689
00:35:56,203 --> 00:35:57,702
I can't.

690
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:01,878
Well done, Bruce.

691
00:36:01,881 --> 00:36:05,377
You're finally beginning
to see things clearly.

692
00:36:05,379 --> 00:36:07,956
The question is...

693
00:36:09,883 --> 00:36:11,883
are you strong enough?

694
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,221
No!

695
00:36:16,223 --> 00:36:18,523
Drop the weapon. Hands
in the air. On your knees.

696
00:36:20,422 --> 00:36:22,088
Arrest me.

697
00:36:30,762 --> 00:36:33,362
Ra's al Ghul is on his way to Blackgate.

698
00:36:33,364 --> 00:36:35,469
And we made contact with Alex's parents.

699
00:36:35,472 --> 00:36:37,668
It's gonna take them a
couple days to get home.

700
00:36:39,637 --> 00:36:42,305
Bruce...

701
00:36:43,608 --> 00:36:46,142
Ra's is a psychopath.

702
00:36:46,144 --> 00:36:48,478
You're not responsible for his actions.

703
00:36:50,181 --> 00:36:51,481
I want to help.

704
00:36:51,483 --> 00:36:53,382
But everything you've said so far...

705
00:36:53,384 --> 00:36:55,539
Alfred dying and coming back to life,

706
00:36:55,542 --> 00:36:56,886
magical waters...

707
00:36:56,888 --> 00:36:59,622
Give me something I can believe.

708
00:36:59,624 --> 00:37:01,961
Perhaps now you understand
why we held back.

709
00:37:01,964 --> 00:37:04,660
It doesn't matter what
you say, Detective.

710
00:37:07,398 --> 00:37:09,398
This is all my fault.

711
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:14,470
Alex is dead because of me.

712
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,340
I killed him.

713
00:37:26,746 --> 00:37:28,112
Oswald!

714
00:37:30,855 --> 00:37:32,855
I waited for you.

715
00:37:32,857 --> 00:37:34,857
Again.

716
00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:36,859
And you didn't show!

717
00:37:36,861 --> 00:37:38,861
Again.

718
00:37:38,863 --> 00:37:40,863
You coward.

719
00:37:43,234 --> 00:37:45,234
Where are you?!

720
00:37:45,236 --> 00:37:46,569
Here.

721
00:37:46,571 --> 00:37:48,649
And I may be many things,

722
00:37:48,652 --> 00:37:50,239
but I am not a coward.

723
00:37:52,043 --> 00:37:54,610
Your riddles suck.

724
00:37:54,612 --> 00:37:58,347
This place may make some people lie,

725
00:37:58,349 --> 00:38:01,617
some people speak, and some people cry.

726
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:03,619
That could mean anything!

727
00:38:03,621 --> 00:38:05,612
Lying, speaking, crying...

728
00:38:05,615 --> 00:38:08,573
You're just describing a
range of human behavior!

729
00:38:08,576 --> 00:38:09,725
No!

730
00:38:09,727 --> 00:38:11,394
I meant lying,

731
00:38:11,396 --> 00:38:13,729
as in lying d...

732
00:38:13,731 --> 00:38:15,804
laying dow... lying down!

733
00:38:15,807 --> 00:38:17,300
As in dead!

734
00:38:17,303 --> 00:38:18,701
Oh.

735
00:38:18,703 --> 00:38:21,037
The answer was Stoker Cemetery.

736
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:22,538
Clearly.

737
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,558
Only an idiot wouldn't see that.

738
00:38:24,561 --> 00:38:26,108
Face it, Ed...

739
00:38:26,111 --> 00:38:28,508
You can't make riddles
to save your ass anymore.

740
00:38:29,781 --> 00:38:31,647
I guess she was right.

741
00:38:31,649 --> 00:38:33,086
What? Who was right?

742
00:38:33,089 --> 00:38:34,217
Your number one fan.

743
00:38:34,219 --> 00:38:36,499
She said that there was
something wrong with you.

744
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:40,305
Took me a while to believe it, but...

745
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,251
you're not smart.

746
00:38:45,254 --> 00:38:47,230
I am too smart.

747
00:38:47,232 --> 00:38:48,598
I'm the Riddler.

748
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,900
Oh, God, that name again? Tell me,

749
00:38:50,902 --> 00:38:53,180
how long did it take you to
come up with those riddles?

750
00:38:53,183 --> 00:38:54,337
I don't know.

751
00:38:54,339 --> 00:38:56,106
A minute? Two minutes?

752
00:38:56,109 --> 00:38:58,109
A few hours.

753
00:38:58,112 --> 00:38:59,745
Six hours.

754
00:39:00,845 --> 00:39:02,345
Six hours?

755
00:39:02,347 --> 00:39:04,447
- Yes.
- For two bad riddles?

756
00:39:04,449 --> 00:39:07,316
Does that sound anything
like the old you?

757
00:39:07,318 --> 00:39:10,294
Well, perhaps I'm still recovering

758
00:39:10,297 --> 00:39:12,863
from being frozen in a block of ice!

759
00:39:12,866 --> 00:39:15,992
But revenge will certainly
make me feel better.

760
00:39:15,994 --> 00:39:17,460
You'll never have revenge on me.

761
00:39:17,462 --> 00:39:19,362
Uh, yeah, I will.

762
00:39:19,365 --> 00:39:21,664
- Uh, no, you won't.
- Oswald...

763
00:39:21,666 --> 00:39:23,499
I'm gonna shoot you.

764
00:39:25,503 --> 00:39:27,336
Yes.

765
00:39:27,338 --> 00:39:28,638
You might shoot me.

766
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,706
"Kill me."

767
00:39:30,708 --> 00:39:34,310
But only he can get revenge on me.

768
00:39:34,312 --> 00:39:36,779
The man I froze on that pier.

769
00:39:38,116 --> 00:39:40,283
The man who would've killed himself

770
00:39:40,285 --> 00:39:42,718
before writing those idiotic riddles.

771
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,788
The man whose name I
still will not speak.

772
00:39:47,392 --> 00:39:50,326
But he's gone.

773
00:39:50,328 --> 00:39:52,495
You're just Ed Nygma.

774
00:39:52,497 --> 00:39:54,897
And not even Ed Nygma.

775
00:39:54,899 --> 00:39:57,455
Because Ed Nygma would've
noticed something.

776
00:39:58,868 --> 00:40:00,145
What?

777
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,740
Doesn't it feel kind of chilly in here?

778
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,476
Oh!

779
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:10,876
You remember him?

780
00:40:11,883 --> 00:40:14,250
My other Victor?

781
00:40:14,252 --> 00:40:16,319
I'm going to put you on ice.

782
00:40:16,321 --> 00:40:18,054
Again.

783
00:40:18,056 --> 00:40:20,264
You want the same
pose or something else?

784
00:40:20,267 --> 00:40:21,791
No. Wait, please.

785
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,059
Got it. Same pose.

786
00:40:23,061 --> 00:40:25,594
No!

787
00:40:27,132 --> 00:40:28,631
Okay, Oswald.

788
00:40:31,736 --> 00:40:33,536
I'm not the Riddler.

789
00:40:38,203 --> 00:40:40,164
Do it.

790
00:40:40,167 --> 00:40:41,666
Stop.

791
00:40:44,082 --> 00:40:46,082
I've changed my mind.

792
00:40:47,385 --> 00:40:49,385
I'm not gonna freeze you.

793
00:40:49,387 --> 00:40:51,420
I would only be freezing

794
00:40:51,422 --> 00:40:54,423
Ed Nygma. Who cares about that?

795
00:40:54,425 --> 00:40:56,258
No.

796
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:58,294
A better revenge is having you live,

797
00:40:58,296 --> 00:41:01,297
knowing that you are not him,

798
00:41:01,299 --> 00:41:03,299
and you never will be again.

799
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:07,536
Good-bye, Ed.

800
00:41:15,635 --> 00:41:17,635
Who am I?

801
00:41:18,816 --> 00:41:21,817
I must've been seven or eight.

802
00:41:23,588 --> 00:41:25,821
It was late.

803
00:41:25,823 --> 00:41:28,491
I snuck downstairs to find my father

804
00:41:28,505 --> 00:41:31,024
with a man before him on his knees,

805
00:41:31,027 --> 00:41:33,662
begging for forgiveness.

806
00:41:33,664 --> 00:41:37,333
My father stabbed him in his neck.

807
00:41:37,335 --> 00:41:40,736
The next morning there
wasn't a trace of blood,

808
00:41:40,739 --> 00:41:43,540
and we had breakfast at that table.

809
00:41:45,782 --> 00:41:49,240
Now, you'd think I'd want
to stay far away from Gotham,

810
00:41:49,243 --> 00:41:51,472
but this house,

811
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:54,984
this city, is in my veins.

812
00:41:54,986 --> 00:41:56,881
I'm home, Jim.

813
00:41:59,123 --> 00:42:01,527
The word on the street
is three Falcone capos

814
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:04,460
- have gone missing.
- Hmm.

815
00:42:04,462 --> 00:42:06,629
They were in hiding.

816
00:42:06,631 --> 00:42:09,265
Penguin used me as
bait to draw them out.

817
00:42:09,268 --> 00:42:10,834
And kill them.

818
00:42:12,336 --> 00:42:14,370
And you let him?

819
00:42:15,673 --> 00:42:17,973
Don't act the innocent, Jim.

820
00:42:17,975 --> 00:42:20,327
You came to Carmine Falcone for help.

821
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:22,630
It was never gonna be bloodless.

822
00:42:22,633 --> 00:42:25,548
So is that your plan?

823
00:42:25,550 --> 00:42:27,959
Get close to Penguin.

824
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,028
Gain his confidence. What then?

825
00:42:30,031 --> 00:42:31,731
I need to know what you're going to do.

826
00:42:31,734 --> 00:42:32,988
No.

827
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:35,291
You don't.

828
00:42:35,293 --> 00:42:37,493
You want the city back from Penguin.

829
00:42:37,495 --> 00:42:39,395
I'll give that to you.

830
00:42:39,398 --> 00:42:41,398
But you have to trust me.

831
00:43:04,322 --> 00:43:07,765
Get ready. Prisoner walking.

832
00:43:13,698 --> 00:43:15,698
Guards, stay sharp!

833
