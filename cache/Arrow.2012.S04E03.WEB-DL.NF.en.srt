that son of a bitch went?

00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,125
He vanished.
We call them Ghosts for a reason.

7
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:43,710
But I got air support
coming in on Number Two.

Twenty feet ahead,
I got one gift wrapped for you.

Feels like old times, the three of us.

Where can I find H.I.V.E.?
Who's behind the Ghosts?

We needed
more boots on the ground, Oliver.

Thea and Laurel
picked a fine day for a spa treatment.

28
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,593
I don't think Thea would be much help
in the state of mind she's in.

29
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,137
Where the hell did they go anyway?

I really enjoy sparring with you, Nyssa.

-I'm not sparring.
-I know.

33
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,783
That's what makes it so much fun.

34
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:53,465
You know I would show you no mercy
if given the opportunity.

35
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:57,469
That's why I take great care
not to give you the opportunity.

My liege, two foreigners are here.

00:03:12,484 --> 00:03:14,736
One of them claims to be
the daughter of Ra's al Ghul.

40
00:03:15,027 --> 00:03:17,405
No. I am his daughter.

41
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,407
What a pleasant surprise.

42
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:20,825
Sister-in-law.

43
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,286
What brings you to Nanda Parbat?

44
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,372
They have a coffin with them, my liege.

45
00:03:26,038 --> 00:03:27,206
A coffin?

46
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,876
I want you
to bring my sister back to life.

47
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,587
No.

48
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,132
You took her life away from her.
It is your obligation to bring her back.

49
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,551
I have no obligations in this house.

50
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:42,179
You don't get to waltz in here and
demand a cup of tea, let alone this.

51
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,056
Thea wasn't dead.

52
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,559
-Sara is.
-Thanks to you.

53
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:50,397
What you are asking for
hasn't been done in ages past.

54
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,189
Even then, only in legend.

55
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:56,403
Which is why I did not ask my father to
use the Pit to save Sara after she fell.

56
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:59,697
Even if Sara went into the Pit,
even if it worked,

57
00:04:00,197 --> 00:04:03,951
who, what came out of the Pit
would not be Sara.

58
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:09,040
Laurel, I am sorry, truly sorry.

59
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,709
But, of course, my answer is no.

60
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,758
Okay, I know that was kind of a bust,

61
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:21,719
but wasn't it fun having the original
"Team Arrow" back together?

62
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,642
-You shouldn't have.
-Got that off one of the Ghosts.

63
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,060
It's where they hide
their cyanide capsules.

64
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,438
Looks like an upper left bicuspid.

65
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,189
There was a very brief time

66
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:36,443
where I envisioned a future for myself
as a dental hygienist.

67
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,903
The best lead we've gotten
in the last three months.

68
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,823
It'll take the DNA sequencer
a little bit of time,

69
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:45,201
so I was thinking margaritas
while we wait.

132
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,866
{\an8}I'm not giving up.

133
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,619
{\an8}I'm never giving up.

134
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,706
{\an8}Because you're thinking only of yourself.

135
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,541
{\an8}I expected your support.

136
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,250
{\an8}I was counting on it.

137
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:05,044
Then you never really knew me at all.

138
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,380
The Pit gave my father a long life.

139
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:12,009
Longer than what was natural
and much longer than he deserved.

140
00:09:12,509 --> 00:09:14,554
But he paid a dark price for it.

141
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,889
A price Thea is no doubt paying now.

142
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:21,728
I wouldn't wish it on my most
bitter enemy, let alone my beloved.

143
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:25,773
I don't know if the Pit
can bring her back.

00:09:26,398 --> 00:09:27,734
And Malcolm's right.

145
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:30,903
I don't know
what Sara will be like if it does.

146
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,281
But what I do know is that I have to try.

147
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:35,575
To what end?

148
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,745
To have your sister
returned to you a monster?

149
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,125
Her spirit, the part that we both love,

150
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:47,920
that's the part that I have to believe
will come back.

151
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:52,091
You're not doing this out of love,
you're doing this out of grief.

I miss Sara, too.

Still wishing you were a dental hygienist?

158
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,911
More like a molecular biologist.

159
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,039
You see this?

160
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:24,791
No.

161
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,501
In my defense, I flunked biology.

162
00:10:27,584 --> 00:10:29,378
Well, I got an A-plus,

163
00:10:29,461 --> 00:10:32,048
and I still have no idea
what the hell is going on here.

164
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:35,927
This DNA has half of the genetic
markers that it should have, half.

165
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,178
How's that possible?

166
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,639
It's not. This guy should be nothing more
than a pile of goo.

167
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:40,723
(ALARM BEEPING)

168
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:42,642
What now?

169
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,436
Robbery at a parts store, Litchfield Ave.

170
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:47,814
-Call Dig. Tell him I'll meet him there.
-Ah!

171
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:49,774
Hold ups are a little below
your pay grade.

172
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:52,193
You sure you don't want
the S.C.P.D. to handle this one?

173
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:55,571
How effective have the police been
in solving the city's problems recently?

174
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,656
That's a good point.

175
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:23,349
John's still not answering his phone.

176
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:24,767
I'll be fine.

177
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,936
Still, I don't like you going out there
without backup.

178
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,896
I'm not. I have you.

179
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,862
That restraint you showed back there,

180
00:11:36,528 --> 00:11:38,030
-bury it.
-Here.

181
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:41,367
Violence is the only thing
these losers understand.

182
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,910
The guys out here who can't handle that,

183
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,912
they either wash out
or end up doing the product,

184
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:49,583
both of which are fast-tracks
to a bullet in the head.

185
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:50,626
The product.

186
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,294
Reiter hasn't told me a lot about it.

187
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,672
He calls it Slam,
genetically modified hybrid,

188
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:58,425
one part heroin poppy, one part coca leaf.

189
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,886
Get you higher than the Empire State.

190
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,095
MAN: Conklin.

191
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:04,891
We got a problem.
Some Slam's missing, a whole cake.

192
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:07,810
The runner was just a distraction.

193
00:12:08,685 --> 00:12:09,896
Any idea who did it?

194
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,815
All right then, round them up!

195
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:14,984
What are you gonna do?

196
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,029
I told you, only one thing
these losers respond to.

197
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,085
Get on the ground.

198
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,421
Thanks for coming, by the way.

199
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:37,006
Ms. Fayad wasn't sure it would work,

200
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,426
but I knew you couldn't turn down
a good old fashioned robbery.

201
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:04,826
(GRUNTING)

202
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,473
Are you ready to call this yet?

203
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:44,198
Now you can call it.

204
00:13:44,781 --> 00:13:46,075
Game's not over yet.

205
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:25,197
Are you all right?

206
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,076
Aside from the fact
that you won't help my friends?

207
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:33,330
I wouldn't be helping Sara,
as you know more than anyone.

208
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,499
What gave me away?

209
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,627
When I was cautioning Laurel
about the effects of the Pit,

210
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:40,421
I saw the look on your face.

211
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:42,882
You're feeling it, aren't you?

212
00:14:43,715 --> 00:14:44,926
The blood lust.

213
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,219
What's happening to me?

214
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,221
The Pit contains traces of the souls

215
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,515
of all the men and women
who have bathed in its waters.

216
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:56,020
And what those waters restore
they can also take. Life for life.

217
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:57,897
What are you saying?

218
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,107
That you need to feed this impulse.

219
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:02,568
Give in to it.

220
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:05,071
Once you do, it will subside for a time.

221
00:15:05,737 --> 00:15:06,780
Okay.

222
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,783
I'll just go on a killing spree.

223
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,494
Thank you for the fatherly advice.

224
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:16,332
Can you just, for a second,
pretend to be a normal father?

225
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,792
Can you do that, Dad?

226
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,670
Do you have anything remotely normal
to offer me?

227
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,175
All right.

228
00:15:26,758 --> 00:15:29,886
There is something,
high in the mountains, a man.

229
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:33,349
Some call him a sage.

230
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:36,102
He has a way
with the ancient arts of healing.

231
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,981
He may be able to help you with this,
though I am not sure.

232
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,110
Does that qualify as being normal?

233
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,946
Normal enough.

234
00:15:47,904 --> 00:15:49,406
Get some rest.

235
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,283
We'll start at first light.

236
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,710
-This hurt?
-Yeah, it stings.

237
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:05,589
Good. That's what you get for trying
to take on a meta all by yourself.

238
00:16:05,672 --> 00:16:06,840
-A meta?
-Yeah!

239
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,136
Turns out, Central City is missing one.

240
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:13,722
A Jeremy Tell. Cisco says
we should call him "Double Down."

241
00:16:13,805 --> 00:16:15,099
Which doesn't exactly make sense,

242
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,809
since he was getting a tattoo
when the dark matter wave hit.

243
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:19,145
You missed quite a show, tonight.

244
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,438
Sorry I couldn't help out.
It's a long story.

245
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:25,567
Oh, my God. It is not a long story.
It is the shortest story in history.

246
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,279
Two guys go take on criminals
without asking for backup

247
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,322
and nearly get killed in the process.

248
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,574
You know,
I haven't said anything up till now,

249
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,243
because I was hoping that the two of you

250
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,078
would remove your heads
from your own asses

251
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,913
without assistance.
Turns out, I was wrong.

252
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:38,998
Hey, Felicity...

253
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:41,125
No, no, no. This is the part where I talk
and you two listen.

254
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:43,127
The both of you nearly got killed
out there tonight

255
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,421
because you didn't have
each other's backs.

256
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,589
That was a one-time deal, Felicity.
It won't happen again.

257
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,008
I absolutely agree.

258
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,885
Because the two of you
are going to sit down here

259
00:16:51,968 --> 00:16:53,679
until you have resolved your issues.

260
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:54,846
Do we have an understanding?

261
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,641
-Hey...
-Do we have an understanding?

262
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:00,852
Yeah.

263
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,979
I'm gonna take this
to a guy at Palmer Tech

264
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:06,567
to find out how some lunatic meta
turns tattoos into lethal weapons.

265
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,571
If you two haven't figured out
your issues by the time I get back,

266
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:14,200
I'm gonna find a bunch of Mirakuru
soldiers to knock some sense into you.

267
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,133
It's been months, man.

268
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:35,137
And I don't know how many apologies...

269
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:37,473
I mean, John, you're a forgiving person.

270
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:40,059
Oliver, this isn't about forgiveness, man.

271
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:44,146
I don't know how
to move forward with this, us.

272
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,231
Doing what we do.

273
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:47,899
-We've worked fine since I got back.
-We've got lucky.

274
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:53,155
Oliver, there was a time
I would've taken a bullet for you.

275
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:55,074
And I don't know if I would do that now.

276
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:58,285
Which means that even when we're
out there, we are not out there together.

277
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:00,371
You crossed a line, man.

278
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:03,332
And the fact that you could do that again
sits in the back of my head somewhere.

279
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:04,833
I get it! I get it.

280
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,961
I understand that I crossed a line.

281
00:18:08,044 --> 00:18:10,589
I understand that I lost your trust.

282
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:15,844
What I do not understand is why you
won't give me a chance to earn it back.

283
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,398
You think this meta tonight
is connected to Darhk?

284
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,359
I don't know. Uh...

285
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,280
He mentioned a new player, a woman.

286
00:18:35,822 --> 00:18:36,907
Fayad.

287
00:18:40,076 --> 00:18:41,120
We need to go.

288
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,205
Where?

289
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:47,209
Some place where I'm gonna try
to trust you again.

290
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:55,176
I like to think of all of us as a team.

291
00:18:56,843 --> 00:18:58,929
Teammates need to trust each other.

292
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,890
Right now,
I'm having a little difficulty doing that.

293
00:19:03,099 --> 00:19:05,311
I want y'all to tell me
who stole the product,

294
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,563
or else this man right here
is gonna eat a bullet.

295
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:11,317
Nobody?

296
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,405
Let's try this again.

297
00:19:17,113 --> 00:19:19,658
Hey, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

298
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,869
You said that violence is the only thing
these people respond to.

299
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,247
Doesn't seem to be working.

300
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:28,041
Well, what do you have in mind,
harsh language?

301
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,461
I've been on this island three years.
I've learned some things.

302
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:31,837
About what?

303
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,673
Pain.

304
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:40,637
(CLEARING THROAT)

305
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,975
-Uh-oh.
-"Uh-oh"?

306
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:48,479
Those aren't the words you wanna say
when your CEO walks into a room.

307
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,315
Well, technically, "uh" and "oh"
aren't words, they're interjections...

308
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:54,193
Please tell me these are the prototypes
for our new world-changing technology.

309
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,487
Since I'm inventing them,
wouldn't that make them my...

310
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:57,571
What is this?

311
00:19:58,154 --> 00:20:00,491
CURTIS: Contact lenses
with built-in HD displays.

312
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:01,950
FELICITY: Ooh, That's impressive and fast.

313
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:03,535
-How much would they sell for?
-100,000.

314
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,580
-$100,000?
-Per lens.

315
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:07,664
(PHONE VIBRATES)

316
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,000
Hmm.

317
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:11,877
<i>Everything okay?</i>

318
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:14,671
Yeah, my phone just keeps acting up.
Need to restart it.

319
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,757
-Ooh!
-(WHIRRING)

320
00:20:17,924 --> 00:20:19,050
Ah!

321
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:21,720
This is an autonomous
communications device.

322
00:20:25,181 --> 00:20:28,977
Which is great, except for the fact
that it spontaneously explodes.

323
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:32,147
Okay, maybe you need something
to get your mind off all this.

324
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,650
Like a little side project,
clear your head.

325
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,610
Like gambling?

326
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,404
I need a full workup.

327
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,947
It's possible it's made out of
some sort of bio-organic material.

328
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:43,450
I need to know everything
that you can find out about it.

329
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,952
Strange. These edges.

330
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:48,204
It doesn't look mass manufactured.
Where'd you find it?

331
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:49,998
Casino.

332
00:20:50,081 --> 00:20:52,459
-You gamble?
-Oh, yeah! All the time. Poker's my jam.

333
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:55,379
It ruined an outside flush for me.
I think my opponent was cheating.

334
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,508
So, you want me to check it
for evidence of marking or something?

335
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,176
Yeah, anything strange,
out of the ordinary.

336
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,761
Like you playing poker?

337
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,348
I will check back in on you later.

338
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,099
-Oh, and, uh, Ms. Smoak?
-Mmm?

339
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:11,770
There's no such thing
as an "outside flush" in poker.

340
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,356
That's probably why I lost.

341
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,907
You remember Russia?

342
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,452
Two years ago,
when we got Lyla out of that prison?

343
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:27,578
Of course.

344
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:30,038
That night, Lawton told me that my brother

345
00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:32,207
was not collateral damage
in a hit gone bad.

346
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,542
That he was the target.

347
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,587
And that Lawton was hired
by an organization called HIVE.

348
00:21:38,129 --> 00:21:39,255
The other week you reacted

349
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:42,843
when I said that Ra's called Darhk's men
a "hive" of operatives.

350
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:43,927
Mmm-hmm.

351
00:21:45,011 --> 00:21:46,597
Could be a coincidence.

352
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,973
I don't think so.

353
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:56,857
Last page.

354
00:22:00,151 --> 00:22:02,195
That woman hired Lawton
to kill my brother.

355
00:22:02,278 --> 00:22:04,990
And I'm betting she hired that meta
that tried to take you out.

356
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:07,576
-Based on what?
-Her name is Mina Fayad.

357
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,831
Two years and you didn't tell me.

358
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,667
We have more in common than you think.

359
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:19,546
Oliver, that's my first legitimate lead.

360
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,049
I have to find her.

361
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:27,846
Ms. Fayad hired you for one job, one.

362
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,932
Against my objections
and only because my associates

363
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,309
are anxious to progress to Phase Three.

364
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:34,978
We shouldn't talk about Genesis...

365
00:22:35,061 --> 00:22:37,355
Don't lecture me about secrecy.

366
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:41,402
Particularly on the same night
that you were just compromised.

367
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:42,444
I...

368
00:22:42,528 --> 00:22:45,947
In the same night that I lost good men
in the name of protecting you.

369
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,324
-Damien.
-Mr. Darhk!

370
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:54,080
I think I require another demonstration.

371
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:58,460
(SCOFFING) You want me to kill her now?

372
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:01,547
Show me.

373
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,133
Try to kill me.

374
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,888
I kill you, I still get paid?

375
00:23:10,346 --> 00:23:11,557
Do it.

376
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:17,729
(GASPS SOFTLY)

377
00:23:20,566 --> 00:23:21,817
What are you?

378
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,235
Ms. Fayad,

379
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,739
many members of HIVE,
they consider me to be a charlatan.

380
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:32,243
That this, this is a parlor trick,

381
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:33,912
sleight of hand.

382
00:23:36,122 --> 00:23:37,123
(GRUNTS)

383
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:45,799
This demonstration was for you, Mr. Tell.

384
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:49,886
Just in case you have any doubt
as to how I process disappointment.

385
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:07,320
(BOTH GRUNTING)

386
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:18,832
(GASPING)

387
00:24:22,168 --> 00:24:23,920
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

388
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,213
How do you feel?

389
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:27,465
How do...

390
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:29,635
How do I feel?

391
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:33,722
Oh, my God.

392
00:24:35,098 --> 00:24:36,892
There is no sage.

393
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,310
There is no cure.

394
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:40,854
There never was.

395
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,564
I'm sorry.

396
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:46,234
You will be compelled to kill until
you've slain the one who hurt you.

397
00:24:46,317 --> 00:24:49,905
But I can't. Okay, Ra's is already dead.

398
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:54,450
Then the only way to cope
is to indulge the blood lust on others.

399
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:55,661
So you...

400
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:59,164
You set your men up to be slaughtered?

401
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:02,333
You will not feel the hunger
to kill again for weeks.

402
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:04,920
No need to thank me.

403
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:10,050
There is nothing I wouldn't do
to help my daughter.

404
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:21,269
I hope we learned a lesson of the benefits
of trusting our friends with our problems.

405
00:25:21,352 --> 00:25:22,604
You mean, like your boyfriend?

406
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,731
You're supposed to be
more evolved than him.

407
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,026
-Hmm?
-Sorry, but he is.

408
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:29,778
-Can we find her?
-FELICITY: No.

409
00:25:30,361 --> 00:25:32,989
She's not coming up on any
of our traffic or security cams.

410
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:35,617
But I think I have the next best thing,
her cell phone. Or at least

411
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:38,286
the one that followed her through airport
security on the way to Star City.

412
00:25:38,369 --> 00:25:39,830
Where's her phone now?

413
00:25:41,247 --> 00:25:42,540
Redmond and 8th.

414

-(CRACKING)
-(SCREAMING IN PAIN)

415
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:53,051
So, which fancy private school
you pick this up in?

416
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,344
Learned it here.

417
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:59,641
Three years on this island, and I have
been hurt every way you can imagine.

418
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:01,517
I know what kills,

419
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:03,144
I know what cripples,

420
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,520
and what just hurts.

421
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:07,941
-(SCREAMING)
-Stop! Stop.

422
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,652
He didn't take the drugs.

423
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:11,737
I did.

424
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:17,450
You're working us too hard,
and some of the other prisoners are hurt.

425
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,911
I wanted to give them
something for the pain.

426
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:23,331
And where's the Slam now?

427
00:26:23,414 --> 00:26:24,499
It's all used up.

428
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,085
And I'm not going to tell you by who,

429
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:29,379
so if you're going to kill me,
just get on with it.

430
00:26:30,421 --> 00:26:31,589
Suit yourself.

431
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:34,092
Wait, wait, wait.

432
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:38,513
You've already executed
one prisoner today.

433
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:41,432
How's Reiter gonna feel about
you exterminating his work force?

434
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,560
Oh, I think he'll make an exception
for a thief.

435
00:26:44,645 --> 00:26:46,312
Or I just make her disappear.

436
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,025
Take her someplace.

437
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,528
They'll never find the body.

438
00:26:58,324 --> 00:27:00,118
All right, take her.

439
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:01,953
Keep them company.

440
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,508
-Wake up. Wake up, we need to go.
-What?

441
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,719
It was a mistake to come here.

442
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:20,013
-Thea.
-Stay the hell away from me.

443
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,389
Thea, what's wrong?

444
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:24,225
He's not gonna help Sara,
and he's not gonna help me.

445
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:27,062
-Thea!
-Don't talk to me.

446
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,564
-I was only trying to help you...
-Help me?

447
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:32,275
Yeah, that's funny
on more than a few levels.

448
00:27:32,358 --> 00:27:36,196
My favorite is you are the reason
why I am like this in the first place.

449
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,488
I know.

450
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:40,283
I will not kill people.

451
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,493
I won't.

452
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:46,164
Just stay out of my life
and the hell away from me.

453
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:49,667
MALCOLM: We are bound together, forever.

454
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,337
You and me, father and daughter.

455
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,340
Let me prove it to you.

456
00:27:55,716 --> 00:27:56,758
How?

457
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,969
I am responsible for Sara's death.

458
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:02,597
Yet, I have the means to make it right,
or at least try to.

459
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:07,310
Do you think, after knowing
what that Pit has done to me,

460
00:28:07,393 --> 00:28:09,813
that I would let that happen to Sara?

461
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:12,733
I think if you are truly sincere
in fighting your blood lust,

462
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,068
you would offer the same to Sara.

463
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:16,862
What are you saying?

464
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:20,115
That I am willing to heal
my daughter's conscience

465
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,868
by restoring your sister's life.

466
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:28,539
That we should prepare Sara's body
for the ceremony.

467
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,761
I'm still getting a ping
off Ms. Fayad's cell phone.

468
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,053
<i>Ten feet ahead.</i>

for answers.

471
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:04,034
My last chance.

-I'm sorry.
-Don't be, Oliver.

This isn't your fault. It's mine.

474
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:15,921
I should've trusted you.

away from me earlier.

We're gonna get answers.

478
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:28,975
Oliver, I haven't been able to get answers
for more than two years now.

479
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:33,646
For more than two years,
you've been doing this alone.

480
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,201
You want me to take a look
at your phone for you, Ms. Smoak?

481
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,328
I think we've reached the point
in our working relationship

482
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:49,996
where you can call me Felicity.

483
00:29:50,746 --> 00:29:53,124
Have you ever considered
how ironic your name is?

484
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:58,088
"Felicity" refers to the ability to find
appropriate expression for one's thoughts,

485
00:29:58,171 --> 00:30:00,715
which is not exactly something
you're particularly good at.

486
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,508
Yeah. You're right.
Let's stick with Ms. Smoak.

487
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:03,969
Any luck on our playing card?

488
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:08,056
Yeah, it's actually right there, Felic...
Uh, Ms. Smoak.

489
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,266
-Mmm-hmm.
-Except it's not a playing card at all.

490
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,684
Now, in my experience,

491
00:30:11,767 --> 00:30:14,645
playing cards don't contain
motor proteins and proprioceptors

492
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:15,939
and a neural net.

493
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,232
The responsible thing to do

494
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,649
would be to get this back
to its rightful owner.

495
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:21,486
Is there any way to track him down?

496
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,696
Well, if you tell me the truth
about where you got it from,

497
00:30:23,779 --> 00:30:25,448
that could speed along the process.

498
00:30:25,531 --> 00:30:26,741
I did tell you the truth.

499
00:30:27,658 --> 00:30:29,744
I did. Now, tracking the owner?

500
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,913
You see this ink here,
for lack of a better word?

501
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:34,875
It's magnetite, which is
the key component to tattoo ink.

502
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,417
-You don't say.
-I do.

503
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:39,880
I also say that magnetite happens to
guide the internal compass of birds,

504
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:41,256
specifically homing pigeons.

505
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:45,010
So is it possible to use the magnetite
in the card to get a location on our, um,

506
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,302
poker player?

507
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:49,931
Theoretically. Though, if your
hypothetical poker opponent

508
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:53,351
has a deck full of these cards,
he'll probably be able to find you faster.

there's a secret elevator in the building?

Obviously, there's
a very long explanation to this.

523
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,347
The short version is that
I work with the Green Arrow.

524
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:33,975
This man is trying to kill me,

Your meta came back
to retrieve his ace of spades.

-he was more freaked out than I was.
-Is he all right?

542
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:57,933
Yes, he's fine.
I sent him to Starling General.

And he only knows about my secret,
not yours.

00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:06,218
Everything's gonna be okay.

631
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,930
Dad's not gonna believe it.

632
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,141
He's gonna be so happy when he sees you.

633
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:13,518
(GRUNTING)

634
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:17,312
-Laurel?
-It's fine.

635
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:21,692
The same thing happened to you
when you first came out of the Pit.

636
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:23,944
She's just taking longer.

637
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:28,574
-It's probably because she was...
-Laurel, we are in uncharted waters here.

638
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,411
I suggest you prepare yourself
for the worst.

639
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,875
My liege, something has happened.

640
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:42,296
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

641
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,183
What have you done?

642
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:57,061
My father was not a trusting man.

643
00:40:00,105 --> 00:40:01,691
He devised means to destroy the Pit

644
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:04,359
should its powers
fall into the wrong hands.

645
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,861
Like yours.

646
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:07,988
Nyssa, why would you
do something like this?

647
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:10,783
How can you even look at your sister
and ask me that?

648
00:40:12,242 --> 00:40:14,662
One day, I will have my moment,

649
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:16,747
and I will kill you.

650
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:19,249
And now when I do,

651
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,252
there will be no coming back.

652
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:25,548
Take her!

653
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:29,134
I warned you, Laurel. I begged you.

654
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:32,430
What happened to Sara last year
was on Malcolm's hands.

655
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:36,434
But what's happening to her now
is on yours.
