1
00:00:56,297 --> 00:00:58,462
IT’S TIME FOR DUHR 
(PRAYER)

2
00:01:28,152 --> 00:01:32,589
JOIN THE THEMED-EVENING AT
THE MOSQUE THIS FRIDAY

3
00:01:32,614 --> 00:01:36,171
IT’S ABOUT WOMEN’S ROLE IN ISLAM

4
00:01:36,172 --> 00:01:40,203
IS JAMILLA COMING?

5
00:01:40,204 --> 00:01:44,583
COME ON, SANA

6
00:01:44,644 --> 00:01:48,542
I DON’T THINK SO

7
00:01:50,483 --> 00:01:52,316
I’LL BE THERE

8
00:01:52,323 --> 00:01:54,254
- We have to celebrate.
- I've bought sparkling wine.

9
00:01:54,278 --> 00:01:55,385
Sparkling wine?

10
00:01:55,835 --> 00:01:56,838
Don't people
celebrate with that?

11
00:01:56,839 --> 00:01:57,839
I want beer.

12
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:02,558
So you are here now.

13
00:02:03,038 --> 00:02:04,038
Am I late?

14
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,460
Yeah, we are done.

15
00:02:06,748 --> 00:02:09,523
Oh, no! I am sorry. I took
the streetcar the wrong way.

16
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:12,445
Yeah! I have heard that one before.

17
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:17,024
- What?
- Taking the streetcar the wrong direction.

18
00:02:17,586 --> 00:02:18,785
You?

19
00:02:18,786 --> 00:02:20,229
Isn’t that what you usually do?

20
00:02:20,429 --> 00:02:22,666
Yeah. I do that when I don’t
want to attend things.

21
00:02:23,603 --> 00:02:27,588
Listen, then you can join Even and
me helping with the wrapping up?

22
00:02:29,142 --> 00:02:34,079
That sounds like so much fun, but I am
super busy. Are the girls upstairs?

23
00:02:34,546 --> 00:02:35,819
Sure.

24
00:02:36,803 --> 00:02:39,413
Sana, can you tell Vilde that I miss her?

25
00:02:40,235 --> 00:02:40,955
What?

26
00:02:41,191 --> 00:02:44,091
You say that to a girl and
they go like “awwww”.

27
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:45,860
No, they don’t do that.

28
00:02:45,861 --> 00:02:46,370
Awwww!

29
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,790
Does it work that way with girls?

30
00:02:47,922 --> 00:02:48,922
You are cute together.

31
00:02:49,665 --> 00:02:51,150
Yeah. We are cuter tan you two.

32
00:02:51,157 --> 00:02:52,350
Ooh! You wish!

33
00:02:56,545 --> 00:03:00,316
No, it’s just something about
the colour “ocean blue”.

34
00:03:00,691 --> 00:03:01,857
Ocean blue?

35
00:03:02,172 --> 00:03:03,172
Ocean.

36
00:03:04,298 --> 00:03:05,651
Is it like royal blue?

37
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:07,261
No, royal blue is like your jacket.

38
00:03:07,262 --> 00:03:08,713
It’s blue like a beach on Marbella.

39
00:03:08,714 --> 00:03:11,343
A beach on Marbella?
Have you been there lately?

40
00:03:12,558 --> 00:03:13,558
Hello.

41
00:03:13,607 --> 00:03:14,607
Hi!

42
00:03:15,342 --> 00:03:16,342
How are you?

43
00:03:16,627 --> 00:03:18,408
Noora’s got her room back!

44
00:03:19,543 --> 00:03:21,103
But what I was going to say was that...

45
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,529
Want some pizza?

46
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,147
Yesterday we tried a new position

47
00:03:24,276 --> 00:03:25,637
we found online.

48
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:26,825
We also have cow meat.

49
00:03:26,914 --> 00:03:34,434
I was over him, sitting.
Like a cowgirl but reversed.

50
00:03:34,459 --> 00:03:37,822
So it was reversed cowgirl.
So he was sitting.

51
00:03:37,847 --> 00:03:40,899
It’s a bit uncomfortable
in the beginning.

52
00:03:40,925 --> 00:03:48,925
I felt like he was watching straight
up, because his head was like... on...

53
00:03:50,112 --> 00:03:58,112
If we did it the right way. It was so, so
good. It hit something, it hit the G-spot.

54
00:04:01,151 --> 00:04:03,289
No. Isn’t G-spot on the upper side?

55
00:04:04,187 --> 00:04:05,853
No, I have heard that the G-spot is anal.

56
00:04:06,978 --> 00:04:08,323
Isn’t that only for boys?

57
00:04:09,698 --> 00:04:12,669
It’s really common to have several G-spots.

58
00:04:13,893 --> 00:04:21,593
Anyways, the thing is that I have never
had such a good time with anyone before.

59
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:25,359
I have never came as much as
I do when I am with Magnus.

60
00:04:25,383 --> 00:04:26,583
It’s amazing!

61
00:04:26,883 --> 00:04:30,989
I just come, and come, and come, and come.

62
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,700
Don’t you have any limits?
About what it’s okay to share?

63
00:04:35,853 --> 00:04:36,853
Like what?

64
00:04:37,946 --> 00:04:40,993
Do you have to share every detail
about you and Magnus’ sex life?

65
00:04:45,292 --> 00:04:49,591
I get that it’s difficult for you
to listen since you can’t have sex...

66
00:04:49,592 --> 00:04:51,961
I can have sex, Vilde.
I just choose not to.

67
00:04:54,181 --> 00:04:59,336
Yeah, I am just saying that it is totally
fine if you are sexually frustrated.

68
00:04:59,337 --> 00:05:01,363
I am not sexually frustrated.

69
00:05:01,587 --> 00:05:08,087
I don’t go around thinking about boys and
sex feeling like I am missing something.

70
00:05:19,928 --> 00:05:21,427
I am just saying that...

71
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,410
sex should be something nice
between you and Magnus.

72
00:05:24,434 --> 00:05:26,634
And not everybody else.

73
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:36,182
Anyone want some tea?

74
00:05:36,966 --> 00:05:38,600
Yeah! That would be great...

75
00:05:47,112 --> 00:05:51,799
Okay. I have to say something,
but I don’t know if it’s true.

76
00:05:51,923 --> 00:05:55,327
I have heard that William has
a new girlfriend in London.

77
00:05:55,328 --> 00:05:56,932
What?! Are you kidding?

78
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:01,019
Chris told me that.

79
00:06:02,243 --> 00:06:03,765
Should I tell her?

80
00:06:04,566 --> 00:06:06,217
Of course you have to tell her!

81
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,477
But, shouldn’t William
be the one to tell her?

82
00:06:10,255 --> 00:06:12,599
Yeah, but obviously he hasn’t told her.

83
00:06:13,146 --> 00:06:16,449
But I don’t know for sure if it’s true.

84
00:06:17,073 --> 00:06:23,073
Also, I don’t understand the thing between
William and Noora. Are they together?

85
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:39,813
What’s up? What are you talking about?

86
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:42,192
Anal sex.

87
00:06:43,144 --> 00:06:47,144
Magnus and I were thinking about trying.

88
00:06:48,955 --> 00:06:51,155
Have you tried it?

89
00:06:53,052 --> 00:06:54,052
No.

90
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,271
You and William, no...

91
00:06:57,489 --> 00:06:58,496
Vilde. No.

92
00:06:59,823 --> 00:07:01,442
At the subject of William. How is he?

93
00:07:04,395 --> 00:07:05,395
Fine...

94
00:07:08,197 --> 00:07:18,397
Yeah. We don't understand what’s the thing
between you two. Are you together or not?

95
00:07:25,382 --> 00:07:27,551
It’s always going to be William and me.

96
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:34,550
TUESDAY
17:50

97
00:07:43,866 --> 00:07:44,866
Hello?

98
00:07:54,242 --> 00:07:56,842
- Try again! Throw it!
- Wrong! You are so bad!

99
00:08:07,041 --> 00:08:09,041
Tell me when. Do it again!

100
00:08:09,066 --> 00:08:11,366
Let Yousef try. Yousef will do it!

101
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:41,408
He is going to miss again. He's tried ten
times and he is still not able to do it.

102
00:08:44,077 --> 00:08:45,623
When does it come?

103
00:08:46,447 --> 00:08:48,647
Let me hear!

104
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:51,005
Throw it then!

105
00:08:51,847 --> 00:08:53,147
Bad! I knew it!

106
00:08:53,872 --> 00:08:55,165
I couldn’t hear, calm down.

107
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:58,933
What’s going on here?

108
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:00,773
Hey, let Sana try.

109
00:09:01,352 --> 00:09:02,435
She will make it, bro!

110
00:09:02,658 --> 00:09:08,504
She is good at basket, she can actually
throw, unlike some other people here.

111
00:09:08,977 --> 00:09:09,997
She learned from me.

112
00:09:10,087 --> 00:09:13,055
What do you mean “learned from me”? Even
mom is better than you at basketball.

113
00:09:13,056 --> 00:09:13,306
Ohh!

114
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:14,930
That hurts.

115
00:09:16,296 --> 00:09:20,773
Listen. If you make it, I’ll be your slave
for a whole week.

116
00:09:20,805 --> 00:09:22,258
Man, don’t do that.

117
00:09:22,508 --> 00:09:24,206
Chill. I am confident, man.

118
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:28,008
Drive me around? Clean my room?

119
00:09:28,227 --> 00:09:29,707
Whatever you want, the whole package.

120
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:32,259
Swear on it.

121
00:09:32,497 --> 00:09:34,511
Wallah! And these guys are my witnesses.

122
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:36,413
No, no. You won’t make it.

123
00:09:36,414 --> 00:09:38,638
It will be fine. Chill. I’ll fix it.

124
00:09:42,367 --> 00:09:43,388
What do I have to do?

125
00:09:43,412 --> 00:09:44,585
Explain it to her.

126
00:09:45,086 --> 00:09:47,886
You take this, throw it and
make it go into the lamp

127
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,700
exactly as Snoop Dog sings:
“Smoke weed every day!”

128
00:09:52,606 --> 00:09:53,240
Just that?

129
00:09:53,264 --> 00:09:54,264
Just that.

130
00:09:54,336 --> 00:09:55,605
She is going to make it.

131
00:09:55,951 --> 00:09:59,053
But if you miss, you will
be my slave for a week.

132
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,175
That wasn’t part of the deal.

133
00:10:01,898 --> 00:10:05,242
Well, you said “just that”?
Are you scared or something?

134
00:10:05,463 --> 00:10:06,596
She is going to make it!

135
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,860
You were so confident, come on!

136
00:10:08,405 --> 00:10:09,405
Give me the ball.

137
00:10:09,699 --> 00:10:12,401
You are going to regret this, Elias!

138
00:10:13,033 --> 00:10:16,208
I am going to win this, relax.
I’ll be fine. Play the music.

139
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:18,396
Looking forward to see Elias crying.

140
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:38,093
She missed.

141
00:10:38,094 --> 00:10:39,094
Aahhh! Nooo!

142
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,240
It’s just what I thought.

143
00:10:40,343 --> 00:10:41,343
Way too early.

144
00:10:43,296 --> 00:10:45,203
Now, can you please make some tea for us?

145
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,693
I am not your friends’ slave.

146
00:10:49,827 --> 00:10:51,442
I know, but they are my guests.

147
00:10:54,719 --> 00:10:56,031
Thank you, slave woman!

148
00:11:00,142 --> 00:11:04,844
That came out wrong. I’m sorry. Calm down.
It was wrong of me to say that.

149
00:11:06,863 --> 00:11:09,847
- Don’t talk to your sister like that!
- That’s your sister!

150
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:13,738
Everything is fine. Relax guys!

151
00:11:14,262 --> 00:11:15,762
Stop it!

152
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,529
WEDNESDAY
14:06

153
00:11:25,154 --> 00:11:26,246
Yours looks like shit.

154
00:11:27,716 --> 00:11:28,489
But it's the truth!

155
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:30,013
Eva, how old are you?

156
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:32,726
- It looks like poop emoji.
- Can I try yours?

157
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,446
- Can’t you feed me?
- Oh my God! You want me to feed you?

158
00:11:35,577 --> 00:11:36,577
Okay, all right.

159
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,467
Yours is good! What is it? Banana?

160
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:44,165
I don’t know. I think it’s mango.

161
00:11:44,189 --> 00:11:45,013
No, it’s not!

162
00:11:45,014 --> 00:11:46,050
Isn’t it lemon?

163
00:11:46,278 --> 00:11:47,823
No, I would have known if it was lemon.

164
00:11:47,824 --> 00:11:50,711
But that tasted like...

165
00:11:50,731 --> 00:11:51,971
Does nobody want to taste mine?

166
00:11:52,114 --> 00:11:53,051
Yeah, it really tasted...

167
00:11:53,052 --> 00:11:55,183
Isn’t that vanilla?

168
00:11:55,184 --> 00:11:58,209
You know what? I think Easter
holidays are boring as shit.

169
00:11:58,826 --> 00:12:00,458
We should have gone to your cabin.

170
00:12:00,836 --> 00:12:03,196
No. I am not going there, it
just makes me think of Kasper.

171
00:12:04,868 --> 00:12:08,714
ARE YOU HOME? I HAVE FORGOTTEN MY KEY

172
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:11,764
It was amazing when
Kasper was in the window.

173
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:14,689
- You both got so scared!
- I thought somebody died!

174
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,690
CALL MOM

175
00:12:16,773 --> 00:12:19,629
- You were the most scared.
- It was because of the mask!

176
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,123
- I’m crying!
- No, I didn’t do that.

177
00:12:24,262 --> 00:12:28,945
Listen, girls. I’ve been
looking at travelling websites

178
00:12:28,969 --> 00:12:31,976
and it’s not that expensive to rent
an apartment in a foreign country.

179
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,555
We should go to France, that would be cool.
Just us lying on the beach.

180
00:12:35,904 --> 00:12:39,974
THEY ARE COMING LATE. I
NEED TO GET HOME NOW.

181
00:12:40,185 --> 00:12:44,374
MEET ME. YOU ARE A SLAVE,
SO YOU HAVE TO DO IT.

182
00:12:44,674 --> 00:12:47,829
WHERE ARE YOU?

183
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:49,945
You want to go to my place
and watch Paradise Hotel?

184
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:50,969
Yeah!

185
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,807
- Can I invite Magnus?
- Sure!

186
00:12:54,824 --> 00:12:56,446
I think I’ll just go home then.

187
00:12:58,379 --> 00:12:59,379
Why?

188
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,187
It’s nothing important, Eskild...

189
00:13:02,411 --> 00:13:06,411
Linn sent me a message and told
me that he is furnishing my room.

190
00:13:07,635 --> 00:13:10,035
Which I haven’t give him permission to do.

191
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:13,459
- I’ll text you later.
- All right.

192
00:13:14,551 --> 00:13:16,098
Bye.

193
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,520
AT THE GYM. COME HERE.

194
00:13:21,557 --> 00:13:23,903
Have you told her about
William’s new girlfriend?

195
00:13:23,927 --> 00:13:26,391
No, I thought we agreed not to tell her.

196
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:30,203
Maybe he told her himself already,
she seemed a liittle down.

197
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:33,386
I have to give a key to my brother.

198
00:13:34,109 --> 00:13:35,109
Where?

199
00:13:35,793 --> 00:13:36,793
Not far away.

200
00:13:38,037 --> 00:13:40,293
Should we go there before
we head to my place?

201
00:13:40,322 --> 00:13:41,322
Yes.

202
00:13:43,978 --> 00:13:46,291
I think the best solution
is to find Noora a new boy.

203
00:13:46,316 --> 00:13:48,580
So that she falls in love and
can forget about William.

204
00:13:49,249 --> 00:13:53,271
Well, she likes bad boys. Do we know any?
We should look for a bad boy.

205
00:13:53,275 --> 00:13:56,735
Jonas and Mahdi! It would be so fun if any
of you got together with any of them.

206
00:13:57,967 --> 00:13:59,774
Really? No, Vilde.

207
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:05,247
I just think it’s so boring that I
am the only one with a boyfriend,

208
00:14:05,272 --> 00:14:08,183
because I have to be with Magnus
when you hang out together.

209
00:14:08,586 --> 00:14:09,612
Can you wait here?

210
00:14:09,638 --> 00:14:10,638
Why?

211
00:14:13,305 --> 00:14:16,387
I don’t think Noora will fall in love with
any boys we already know.

212
00:14:16,411 --> 00:14:18,411
We need someone new.

213
00:14:18,797 --> 00:14:21,930
And where would we find
new, cool and hot boys?

214
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:24,256
¡Elias!

215
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,081
Hello, slave.

216
00:15:30,852 --> 00:15:31,852
Here.

217
00:15:35,604 --> 00:15:36,842
Who are your friends?

218
00:15:37,975 --> 00:15:38,975
Vilde.

219
00:15:39,352 --> 00:15:40,352
Elias.

220
00:15:50,745 --> 00:15:52,936
Yeah, I think we have found them...

221
00:16:03,914 --> 00:16:04,973
No, no, no.

222
00:16:14,513 --> 00:16:16,713
FRIDAY
20:17

223
00:16:20,884 --> 00:16:21,861
I need to pee.

224
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,038
Go pee then.

225
00:16:23,114 --> 00:16:24,463
No, you can get fined for that.

226
00:16:24,494 --> 00:16:28,111
What’s the sense of hanging
out with your brother now?

227
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:30,640
I don’t know. Ask Vilde.

228
00:16:32,263 --> 00:16:38,013
No. I just think it would be nice
to meet some new cool and hot boys.

229
00:16:38,637 --> 00:16:41,637
Have you meet Sana’s brother? He is so hot!

230
00:16:42,576 --> 00:16:43,656
Don’t you have a boyfriend?

231
00:16:44,665 --> 00:16:45,837
Fuck! It’s really cold.

232
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:49,158
They are on their way.
They know about a party.

233
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:51,333
They are not coming. They
are childish assholes.

234
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:55,134
No, they are not assholes.
They are 97 guys.

235
00:16:55,158 --> 00:16:56,257
Just like William...

236
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,500
for example.

237
00:17:03,744 --> 00:17:05,377
Hello, boys.

238
00:18:19,178 --> 00:18:20,801
You hate hanging out with us, don’t you?

239
00:18:23,325 --> 00:18:25,052
We are going to a party!

240
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,796
Where is the party we’re going to?

241
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,826
Hello?

242
00:18:32,914 --> 00:18:34,227
Hello, where are you?

243
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:42,328
Shit! I forgot.

244
00:18:42,452 --> 00:18:44,506
I had to help Noora.

245
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:46,276
Well, where are you right now?

246
00:18:48,474 --> 00:18:49,535
On a streetcar.

247
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:53,280
We are on our way to a party.

248
00:18:56,959 --> 00:18:59,459
I can hear what you are thinking.

249
00:18:59,801 --> 00:19:04,694
I’m thinking it would be easier if you
had friends more similar to you...

250
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:08,356
I am able to have Norwegian friends
and still be myself.

251
00:19:08,408 --> 00:19:09,443
Okay.

252
00:19:10,267 --> 00:19:13,922
I trust you. See you later at home.

253
00:19:14,023 --> 00:19:15,119
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

254
00:19:27,494 --> 00:19:31,237
TIME FOR PRAYER

255
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:22,100
@Ledgerina
