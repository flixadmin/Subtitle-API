1
00:00:42,525 --> 00:00:44,193
Stop!

2
00:00:48,406 --> 00:00:49,616
OK!

3
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,000
- How are you?
- Very well. How are you?

4
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:01,169
Your ID, please.

5
00:01:02,129 --> 00:01:03,588
Certainly.

6
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,279
Give me that.

7
00:01:29,572 --> 00:01:32,575
How many times have I told you
not to throw the ball over there?

8
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,577
Are you trying
to scare your sister or what?

9
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:36,329
- She's crying.
- Of course she's crying.

10
00:01:36,412 --> 00:01:37,998
Don't you see she's just a baby?

11
00:01:38,081 --> 00:01:40,167
You yourself were a baby
not too long ago.

12
00:01:40,249 --> 00:01:41,375
Yes, Dad.

13
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:43,377
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

14
00:01:44,671 --> 00:01:48,257
- What's wrong, Juan Pablo?
- I want her to die.

15
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:52,762
Never say that.

16
00:01:54,388 --> 00:01:59,978
We are a family and we have
to look out for each other, always.

17
00:02:00,061 --> 00:02:02,730
You hear me?

18
00:02:15,076 --> 00:02:15,994
Hello.

19
00:02:16,077 --> 00:02:18,496
<i>Cousin, Poison just took out some cops.</i>

20
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:21,541
- Yes, go on. How many?
- <i>Two.</i>

21
00:02:21,624 --> 00:02:24,127
Yeah, but two what?
Sergeants or officers?

22
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:26,171
<i>Officers. You know Poison.</i>

23
00:02:26,254 --> 00:02:30,050
- Officers are a million each.
- <i>OK, so two million?</i>

24
00:02:30,133 --> 00:02:33,220
- Yes, I'm writing it down here.
- <i>OK, talk to you later.</i>

25
00:02:33,302 --> 00:02:34,679
All right.

26
00:02:35,638 --> 00:02:37,431
What were you talking about?

27
00:02:37,515 --> 00:02:39,433
Just business.

28
00:02:39,517 --> 00:02:42,145
I want to be a businessman like you.

29
00:04:29,543 --> 00:04:32,130
<i>Pablo's path was total war.</i>

30
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:37,260
<i>He established a bounty system for killing
cops and over 200 were slaughtered.</i>

31
00:04:38,219 --> 00:04:41,639
<i>The police had to build a special morgue
just to hold the bodies.</i>

32
00:04:44,309 --> 00:04:46,644
<i>The cops, they took vengeance.</i>

33
00:04:52,441 --> 00:04:55,320
My name is Alba Borraga,
born 1962 in Popayán.

34
00:04:55,403 --> 00:04:58,447
Father Sandoval, mother María.
We own a large tobacco farm.

35
00:04:58,531 --> 00:05:03,203
I graduated Universidad del Cauca
with an emphasis in chemical engineering.

36
00:05:03,286 --> 00:05:05,121
OK, try it again and look at me.

37
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:07,040
I've already done it 17 times.

38
00:05:07,248 --> 00:05:09,000
You got me and my wife into this.

39
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:12,420
Now sit down and do it again
until you get it right.

40
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,550
My name is Alba Borraga,
born 1962 in Popayán.

41
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:20,261
Father Sandoval, mother María.
We own a large tobacco farm.

42
00:05:20,345 --> 00:05:25,933
I graduated Universidad del Cauca
with an emphasis in chemical engineering.

43
00:05:26,017 --> 00:05:28,811
What if they ask me
a question about chemistry?

44
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:31,605
- I hope you're good at bullshitting.
- OK...

45
00:05:31,689 --> 00:05:34,108
Sit down. Do it again.
It's getting better.

46
00:05:35,693 --> 00:05:37,070
<i>We were protecting Elisa</i>

47
00:05:37,153 --> 00:05:40,656
<i>because she could tie Escobar
to the Palace of Justice...</i>

48
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:45,203
<i>but by protecting a communist,
we were traitors.</i>

49
00:05:45,286 --> 00:05:46,620
<i>Go figure.</i>

50
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:51,769
Let's go.

51
00:06:54,063 --> 00:06:55,982
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

52
00:06:58,067 --> 00:06:59,986
Honey, thank you.

53
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:03,739
- You better help us get Escobar.
- I want him dead, too.

54
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,283
Yeah, but we're not a death squad, OK?

55
00:07:05,366 --> 00:07:07,868
You clearly don't know
your country's history in Latin America.

56
00:07:07,952 --> 00:07:11,456
- Sorry, I didn't hear that...
- Honey, mellow out, OK?

57
00:07:27,596 --> 00:07:30,183
Steve, I know you're mad,
but this is the right thing to do.

58
00:07:30,266 --> 00:07:32,906
The right thing to do? I didn't have
a choice in the matter, did I?

59
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,188
<i>This is the only choice.</i>

60
00:07:35,271 --> 00:07:37,606
<i>You should
think about going back to Miami.</i>

61
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,568
They're in their car. Hold on.

62
00:07:40,776 --> 00:07:43,488
Wow. Maybe I will.

63
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:45,448
Just get in the car, OK?

64
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,330
OK, OK, they're on the move.

65
00:07:52,413 --> 00:07:54,165
Go. Go, go, go.

66
00:08:01,714 --> 00:08:06,511
Should've never brought Connie down here.
She's not cut out for it.

67
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:10,348
- He's got that commie bitch with him.
<i>- Don't do anything stupid.</i>

68
00:08:10,431 --> 00:08:13,476
<i>Just keep your head down
and this'll all be over soon enough.</i>

69
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,769
We're gonna cut him off
up here on the left.

70
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,821
Get out of the car, Murphy!

71
00:08:26,489 --> 00:08:27,532
Get out!

72
00:08:28,824 --> 00:08:31,077
- Step away from the vehicle.
- You following me?

73
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,580
- Move him away.
- Easy.

74
00:08:33,662 --> 00:08:34,581
- Easy.
- Back!

75
00:08:34,663 --> 00:08:36,332
- Come on. Move the fuck back!
- Get your hands...

76
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,936
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Hey!

77
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,293
- You spying on me?
- Relax, Murphy!

78
00:08:39,377 --> 00:08:41,295
Who the fuck were you talking to?

79
00:08:43,964 --> 00:08:45,383
The fuck is she?

80
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:55,976
Stand down.

81
00:08:58,062 --> 00:09:00,940
Who were you talking to, huh?

82
00:09:01,023 --> 00:09:02,024
Peña.

83
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,777
I got wife troubles.

84
00:09:05,819 --> 00:09:08,030
- Wife troubles.
- Yeah.

85
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:12,285
Your husband was clever
to get them to follow him.

86
00:09:12,368 --> 00:09:13,994
I hope he's OK.

87
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:18,416
Shit.

88
00:09:35,558 --> 00:09:38,185
Good morning, ladies.
Where are you headed?

89
00:09:38,269 --> 00:09:42,064
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm American. I don't speak Spanish.

90
00:09:43,524 --> 00:09:45,234
You speak Spanish?

91
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:46,527
Yes.

92
00:09:47,778 --> 00:09:50,114
I asked where you are headed.

93
00:09:50,197 --> 00:09:52,492
- Popayán.
- Popayán?

94
00:09:52,575 --> 00:09:54,160
Your papers, please.

95
00:09:54,368 --> 00:09:56,078
Uh, documents.

96
00:10:40,914 --> 00:10:42,458
Ms. Connie Murphy.

97
00:10:44,084 --> 00:10:45,252
Alba Borraga.

98
00:10:46,629 --> 00:10:48,005
Have a nice trip.

99
00:10:49,173 --> 00:10:50,633
- Thank you.
- Be well.

100
00:10:50,717 --> 00:10:52,092
<i>Gracias, señor.</i>

101
00:11:01,686 --> 00:11:03,270
Hello?

102
00:11:05,773 --> 00:11:07,983
OK, yes.

103
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,486
OK, you got her to the orphanage.
Good.

104
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,987
Elisa's fine.

105
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,783
Oh, God.
No, I'm just glad you're OK.

106
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:18,536
Listen, I want you to be smart, OK?

107
00:11:18,619 --> 00:11:20,413
I want you to call me
every other hour from the road.

108
00:11:20,496 --> 00:11:22,122
Actually, call me every hour.

109
00:11:23,541 --> 00:11:26,460
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

110
00:11:26,544 --> 00:11:28,421
I love you, too.

111
00:11:28,504 --> 00:11:30,798
I'm proud of you. Bye.

112
00:11:33,467 --> 00:11:37,846
<i>Now that I knew Connie was safe,
I could focus on César Gaviria.</i>

113
00:11:38,806 --> 00:11:43,269
<i>At the time, the only thing more dangerous
than being a Colombian cop</i>

114
00:11:43,352 --> 00:11:46,021
<i>was being a Colombian
presidential candidate.</i>

115
00:12:04,373 --> 00:12:05,708
Mm-hm.

116
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:08,877
<i>Gaviria had come out
in favor of extraditing the narcos</i>

117
00:12:08,961 --> 00:12:13,633
<i>to the United States, and it was in our
best interest that he win the presidency.</i>

118
00:12:13,716 --> 00:12:15,008
<i>- But to win...
- Gracias.</i>

119
00:12:15,092 --> 00:12:17,177
<i>He had to survive until election day.</i>

120
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:18,846
Uh, <i>Señor</i> Gaviria?

121
00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:20,514
Through that door.

122
00:12:27,688 --> 00:12:29,565
- You must be Agent Murphy.
<i>- Hola.</i>

123
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:30,733
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.

124
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:34,320
I'm Eduardo Sandoval,
head of security of Dr. Gaviria.

125
00:12:34,403 --> 00:12:35,446
What can we do for you?

126
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:38,449
I'm hoping that our agency
can offer some resources

127
00:12:38,532 --> 00:12:41,452
to Mr. Gaviria and your campaign.

128
00:12:41,535 --> 00:12:45,914
Shouldn't the DEA be out
chasing traffickers or is just my thought?

129
00:12:45,998 --> 00:12:48,793
- I think the two coincide.
- Agent Murphy.

130
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,128
- Pleasure, sir.
- The pleasure is mine.

131
00:12:51,211 --> 00:12:53,088
Please, have a seat.

132
00:12:57,844 --> 00:13:02,765
Your Secret Service
has briefed us on security measures.

133
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:07,019
No open-air speaking engagements,
different routes home every day.

134
00:13:07,102 --> 00:13:11,273
As if, after the deaths of Lara and Galán,
we needed an education on these things.

135
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:12,608
- Come on.
- Exactly.

136
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,372
These men will stop at nothing
to kill you.

137
00:13:14,443 --> 00:13:18,698
I'm aware of that.
And we're taking every precaution.

138
00:13:18,906 --> 00:13:22,951
Your government even offers
the use of an armored Cadillac limousine,

139
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:24,871
built for your president.

140
00:13:24,953 --> 00:13:28,624
The thing is that driving around in Bogotá
with an American-made tank

141
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,293
won't exactly endear us to the voters.

142
00:13:32,002 --> 00:13:37,257
And to be honest...
we don't know how to respond to that one.

143
00:13:37,466 --> 00:13:40,845
Somebody offered me a brand new Caddy,
I'd say thank you.

144
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,932
Well, thank you.

145
00:13:45,015 --> 00:13:46,016
And this?

146
00:13:48,602 --> 00:13:50,771
What are we supposed to do with this?

147
00:13:52,606 --> 00:13:54,233
Bullet-proof pants.

148
00:13:55,484 --> 00:13:57,486
I suggest that you wear them.

149
00:13:59,613 --> 00:14:02,825
Thank you, Agent Murphy,
for your consideration.

150
00:14:02,909 --> 00:14:05,327
And we'll keep in mind your advice.

151
00:14:07,621 --> 00:14:08,873
Thank you for your time.

152
00:14:13,043 --> 00:14:14,921
WITH GAVIRIA
THERE WILL BE A FUTURE

153
00:14:15,003 --> 00:14:17,423
<i>César Gaviria was riding
a wave of public support</i>

154
00:14:17,631 --> 00:14:20,467
<i>for his stance on extradition.
This made him a target.</i>

155
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:26,223
<i>But we had a target of our own:
José Rodríguez Gacha,</i>

156
00:14:26,306 --> 00:14:29,852
<i>who we tracked to Cartagena
through one of our informants.</i>

157
00:14:36,191 --> 00:14:39,528
Have you heard
of this thing called a computer?

158
00:14:40,404 --> 00:14:43,991
Some guy was trying to sell me a computer.
I don't know what it is.

159
00:14:44,074 --> 00:14:49,455
It's a new kind of technology
that's coming out.

160
00:14:50,414 --> 00:14:52,708
- It's coming out now?
- Yeah, Dad.

161
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:57,045
Hey, honey.

162
00:14:59,172 --> 00:15:02,217
You look very beautiful today.

163
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:08,933
Relax, baby. Relax.
We don't bite.

164
00:15:10,601 --> 00:15:13,938
- Do you need anything else?
- I want you.

165
00:15:14,897 --> 00:15:17,650
- Nothing more, thank you.
- Yes, sir.

166
00:15:20,527 --> 00:15:22,488
I want to fuck her.

167
00:15:22,696 --> 00:15:26,617
We have more important things
to worry about right now, my son.

168
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:28,368
Understood?

169
00:15:29,536 --> 00:15:31,998
Talk to me. What do you know?

170
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,959
Don Gonzalo,
we have people all over the property.

171
00:15:35,042 --> 00:15:36,376
It's secure.

172
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:40,172
We've got a few men in town as well.

173
00:15:40,255 --> 00:15:44,426
Now, what can you tell me
about Medellín?

174
00:15:45,886 --> 00:15:47,763
The same, boss.

175
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:51,934
Carrillo's entire Search Bloc
is out looking for Pablo.

176
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:53,393
Thank you, Navegante.

177
00:15:53,602 --> 00:15:56,522
- Here to serve, boss.
- Keep us safe.

178
00:15:59,066 --> 00:16:00,317
Don Freddy.

179
00:16:03,445 --> 00:16:06,323
Son... a question.

180
00:16:07,658 --> 00:16:10,661
Are we sheep or are we wolves?

181
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:15,123
- We're wolves.
- We're wolves! Right.

182
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:16,709
I like it.

183
00:16:19,127 --> 00:16:23,090
They're in
a house outside of Cartagena, right here.

184
00:16:23,173 --> 00:16:26,969
Just know there are
a lot of people guarding him.

185
00:16:27,177 --> 00:16:32,182
Navegante, you've been
working for Gacha for many years.

186
00:16:32,265 --> 00:16:36,186
I'm sure in that time you've
earned way more than we are giving you.

187
00:16:37,104 --> 00:16:39,648
So tell me,
why do you want to betray him?

188
00:16:43,276 --> 00:16:45,278
That fucker's crazy.

189
00:16:46,822 --> 00:16:48,908
He's gonna get us all killed.

190
00:16:59,126 --> 00:17:01,461
I don't believe him one bit.

191
00:17:01,545 --> 00:17:04,256
What do you care
why he's doing it?

192
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:09,469
Because we have 23 agents with
outdated weapons waiting in Barranquilla.

193
00:17:09,553 --> 00:17:13,724
And he has twice as many men
with brand new weapons.

194
00:17:13,807 --> 00:17:15,517
And frankly...

195
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:20,022
I'm tired of sending young men
to face certain death.

196
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:22,232
So then we have to be smart.

197
00:17:24,401 --> 00:17:26,403
We have to create a trap.

198
00:17:26,486 --> 00:17:29,073
If we catch him alive,
he'll give us Escobar.

199
00:17:29,156 --> 00:17:30,657
And the Ochoas.

200
00:17:30,741 --> 00:17:34,494
- The entire cartel.
- I don't give a fuck, Javier.

201
00:17:34,578 --> 00:17:35,913
I want him dead.

202
00:17:35,996 --> 00:17:38,124
He doesn't care about death.

203
00:17:38,206 --> 00:17:41,293
He only fears rotting in jail.

204
00:17:42,711 --> 00:17:46,590
- That's the real victory.
- Right, I forgot you're a gringo.

205
00:17:47,674 --> 00:17:51,511
- What's that supposed to mean?
- What are you risking?

206
00:17:51,595 --> 00:17:53,388
These aren't your men.

207
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,808
You have no family here to lose.

208
00:17:55,891 --> 00:17:58,393
If this goes badly, there will be
more widows and orphans,

209
00:17:58,602 --> 00:18:01,647
and I'll have to carry that
on my shoulders.

210
00:18:04,858 --> 00:18:06,735
Well...

211
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,404
I trust his information.

212
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:14,451
And I trust you.

213
00:18:15,285 --> 00:18:20,248
But if this turns out bad...
it'll be on your conscience.

214
00:18:27,673 --> 00:18:29,591
What do we got?

215
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:33,512
Routine airport surveillance.
We tagged Poison.

216
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:46,150
Who's this guy?

217
00:18:46,233 --> 00:18:48,610
I don't know, but if Poison
showed his face to pick him up,

218
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:50,320
he must be really important.

219
00:18:53,115 --> 00:18:55,159
Here's your payment, sir.

220
00:18:57,285 --> 00:19:00,914
It'll be taken to the coast of Spain
on a cargo ship.

221
00:19:00,998 --> 00:19:04,459
From there, our trucks
will take it to the Basque country.

222
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,462
It's all set up.

223
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:13,552
5,000 kilos or I go back to Spain
on the first flight.

224
00:19:18,015 --> 00:19:19,474
What's that?

225
00:19:21,601 --> 00:19:23,729
As far as I know, you and my cousin
have an agreement.

226
00:19:23,937 --> 00:19:26,148
The agreement is for this amount.

227
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:27,858
What kind of bullshit is this?

228
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,486
5,000 kilos or no deal.

229
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,867
Then there is no deal. Who the fuck
do you think you're talking to?

230
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,999
Forgive my cousin, sir.

231
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:52,007
5,000 it is, then.

232
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:01,934
We shouldn't go.

233
00:20:03,227 --> 00:20:05,437
I want you in the US.

234
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,440
You'll be safe there,
far from all of this.

235
00:20:08,523 --> 00:20:11,443
- What if something happens...
- Nothing is going to happen to me.

236
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:14,071
Let's go.

237
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,668
Please, protect him.

238
00:20:29,544 --> 00:20:32,714
Don't worry, everything will be fine.
Come on, I'll walk you.

239
00:20:38,262 --> 00:20:40,347
Bye, Daddy, I love you!

240
00:20:55,237 --> 00:20:57,530
<i>Gaviria's life was on the line...</i>

241
00:20:58,406 --> 00:21:00,659
<i>my wife was with Colombia's
most wanted fugitive,</i>

242
00:21:00,867 --> 00:21:03,120
<i>and my partner was in Cartagena.</i>

243
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:06,081
<i>He had his own mission,
with a group of cops</i>

244
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:10,336
<i>who had seen their friends and relatives
die at the hands of Gacha.</i>

245
00:21:11,795 --> 00:21:15,966
<i>Like Trujillo,
whose father and two brothers, all cops,</i>

246
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:18,551
<i>had died in gun battles with the cartel.</i>

247
00:21:22,222 --> 00:21:27,269
<i>As hard as we were going after Gacha,
the narcos wanted Gaviria.</i>

248
00:21:32,983 --> 00:21:35,819
<i>It killed me to ask for help
from this guy.</i>

249
00:21:35,902 --> 00:21:39,698
<i>Suárez was as slimy as a hagfish,
with none of the charm.</i>

250
00:21:39,781 --> 00:21:42,826
- Hello, Suárez.
- Look who's here.

251
00:21:42,909 --> 00:21:44,619
The Golden Gringo.

252
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:46,372
You don't call, you don't write.

253
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:49,333
I called your office.

254
00:21:50,334 --> 00:21:52,002
I only speak to Peña.

255
00:21:55,172 --> 00:21:57,132
I need to know who this is.

256
00:21:57,216 --> 00:22:00,010
I need... I need...

257
00:22:01,594 --> 00:22:04,973
I need to know who he is.

258
00:22:06,683 --> 00:22:10,229
"I need to know who he is."

259
00:22:10,437 --> 00:22:12,480
Don't make me laugh, faggot.

260
00:22:13,399 --> 00:22:15,734
"I need to know who he is."

261
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:19,446
The fuck back! Fuck back.

262
00:22:20,322 --> 00:22:21,614
OK.

263
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:25,702
You work for me, asshole!

264
00:22:25,785 --> 00:22:28,663
Right? Clear? Is that clear?

265
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:33,043
You know who he is?
Gonna tell me? Gonna speak? Yeah...

266
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:37,923
<i>Suárez knew exactly who
this guy was, and he wasn't the only one.</i>

267
00:22:39,132 --> 00:22:41,801
- Jesus Christ.
- Next time you wanna fuck somebody,

268
00:22:41,885 --> 00:22:42,969
take 'em on a date.

269
00:22:43,053 --> 00:22:44,471
What's going on?

270
00:22:44,554 --> 00:22:46,306
I have reason to believe
the Medellín cartel

271
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:48,600
is planning an imminent attack
against Gaviria.

272
00:22:48,808 --> 00:22:50,018
We have no intel to that effect.

273
00:22:50,102 --> 00:22:53,897
Maybe you should do your job instead
of spying on other agency personnel.

274
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:58,360
- What's he talking about?
- Nothing, Ambassador.

275
00:22:58,444 --> 00:23:00,612
CIA's been so kind
to give us these documents,

276
00:23:00,695 --> 00:23:04,032
but 90 percent of them
are too classified for us to read.

277
00:23:04,241 --> 00:23:06,410
I need to get into the White Room.

278
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:07,994
What's that?

279
00:23:08,203 --> 00:23:09,913
Cut the shit.
You're gonna give me these files.

280
00:23:09,996 --> 00:23:13,500
You've been reading too many spy novels.

281
00:23:14,876 --> 00:23:17,754
Spy novels...
Have you read <i>The Spaniard?</i>

282
00:23:19,172 --> 00:23:20,673
Where the hell did you get that?

283
00:23:20,757 --> 00:23:22,592
Ma'am, he has been in the country
for several days.

284
00:23:22,675 --> 00:23:25,512
He's been escorted
by one of Pablo's top <i>sicarios.</i>

285
00:23:25,595 --> 00:23:26,596
Let me see this.

286
00:23:27,431 --> 00:23:30,350
I know the CIA has intel on this man.

287
00:23:32,685 --> 00:23:35,897
Now, are you going
to give me access or not?

288
00:23:40,193 --> 00:23:42,362
Technically, the room isn't white.

289
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:45,073
It's more of a... burgundy.

290
00:23:51,497 --> 00:23:54,582
- Agent Schroeder, will you join us?
- Mm-hm.

291
00:23:56,626 --> 00:23:59,338
<i>The White Room
was a top secret repository</i>

292
00:23:59,421 --> 00:24:02,757
<i>for the CIA's deepest,
darkest secrets.</i>

293
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:07,012
<i>So secret, in fact, that its
very existence was never acknowledged.</i>

294
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:14,978
Sit here.

295
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,940
Agent Schroeder
will watch you the entire time.

296
00:24:20,066 --> 00:24:21,651
Where are the files?

297
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:36,124
I feel like he's still too soft.

298
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:37,292
He'll be fine.

299
00:24:39,961 --> 00:24:41,129
I don't know, Pablo.

300
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:43,882
I feel like we need
to suspend the operation.

301
00:24:43,965 --> 00:24:47,511
- It's too delicate.
- You worry too much, Gustavo.

302
00:24:49,095 --> 00:24:52,932
That's the reason
your hair is falling out.

303
00:24:53,016 --> 00:24:55,352
Very funny, motherfucker.

304
00:24:57,854 --> 00:24:59,606
Keep laughing.

305
00:25:02,359 --> 00:25:04,236
How's our boy doing, Mom?

306
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:07,531
He's learning,
with a little tough love.

307
00:25:07,614 --> 00:25:09,575
- What's up, Aunt?
- What's new?

308
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:14,954
That's so he can mix
with the sons of the oligarchs, right?

309
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:17,624
- Yes, sir.
- So he can get us some information.

310
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:20,544
What about these clowns?

311
00:25:21,961 --> 00:25:23,589
Are they treating you right?

312
00:25:24,548 --> 00:25:26,341
More or less.

313
00:25:27,384 --> 00:25:30,762
What do you mean "more or less"?
We treat you good.

314
00:25:32,138 --> 00:25:33,932
Are we going to eat, Gustavo?

315
00:25:36,351 --> 00:25:37,894
- Some rice?
- Yes.

316
00:25:44,568 --> 00:25:45,944
Thank you.

317
00:25:47,362 --> 00:25:48,447
Jaime.

318
00:25:50,574 --> 00:25:52,742
Welcome to the family.

319
00:25:54,453 --> 00:25:56,413
Thank you, boss.

320
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:02,043
Can't you do anything?

321
00:26:03,211 --> 00:26:04,337
No.

322
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:08,550
While we're at war,
we can't do anything.

323
00:26:09,342 --> 00:26:12,011
This is bullshit.
People are turning up dead every day

324
00:26:12,095 --> 00:26:15,307
and my friends
think my brothers are responsible.

325
00:26:17,434 --> 00:26:19,852
Let's talk about something else, baby.

326
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,105
Yes.

327
00:26:23,022 --> 00:26:26,025
All right,
let's talk about running away together.

328
00:26:26,109 --> 00:26:28,153
Let's get away while we can.

329
00:26:30,614 --> 00:26:33,908
"Let's get away."
Listen to this.

330
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:42,750
Why would you run away
with a criminal like me?

331
00:26:44,419 --> 00:26:45,962
And why not?

332
00:26:48,715 --> 00:26:50,592
I wish it was that easy.

333
00:26:50,676 --> 00:26:53,428
- Ah.
- I can't just leave like that.

334
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:55,430
I know.

335
00:26:55,514 --> 00:26:57,974
You say that because of your wife.

336
00:26:58,057 --> 00:27:00,519
I don't give a shit about my wife.

337
00:27:01,478 --> 00:27:05,607
I'm talking about your other wife, Pablo.

338
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:07,942
Who is the woman
in that relationship?

339
00:27:08,026 --> 00:27:09,444
You?

340
00:27:18,495 --> 00:27:22,040
<i>Gacha was always paranoid
when things were quiet.</i>

341
00:27:22,123 --> 00:27:25,377
<i>And now, he began to wonder
about Navegante.</i>

342
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:39,807
Hey, doll.

343
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:41,393
What are you doing?

344
00:27:43,186 --> 00:27:44,479
I'm married, sir.

345
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:46,606
That's no problem.
I can make you a widow pretty quick.

346
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:49,108
Don't touch me! Don't touch me.

347
00:27:49,192 --> 00:27:51,695
Freddy, leave her alone.
Come here.

348
00:27:51,778 --> 00:27:52,820
What's up?

349
00:27:53,029 --> 00:27:56,449
The Search Bloc is here,
not in Medellín.

350
00:27:56,533 --> 00:27:58,284
But Navegante said they were over there.

351
00:27:58,368 --> 00:28:02,163
Navegante... Navegante is a liar.

352
00:28:02,372 --> 00:28:03,790
He wouldn't betray you.

353
00:28:03,998 --> 00:28:08,378
Freddy... think, think.

354
00:28:08,461 --> 00:28:11,423
Everyone in the world has a price.

355
00:28:13,675 --> 00:28:15,260
All right, let's go!

356
00:28:15,343 --> 00:28:17,929
They want war, we'll give them war!

357
00:28:31,317 --> 00:28:34,738
<i>The Spaniard was a name
that got everyone's attention.</i>

358
00:28:34,821 --> 00:28:36,864
<i>He was a member of Eta.</i>

359
00:28:37,073 --> 00:28:38,950
<i>Never heard of 'em?</i>

360
00:28:39,158 --> 00:28:41,869
<i>They made bomb-making
a goddamn art form.</i>

361
00:28:45,373 --> 00:28:49,294
<i>They were a group of supposed
freedom fighters from the Basque country,</i>

362
00:28:49,377 --> 00:28:51,379
<i>trying to secede from Spain.</i>

363
00:28:52,756 --> 00:28:56,384
<i>Their specialty was
targeted assassinations of public figures.</i>

364
00:28:59,095 --> 00:29:03,891
<i>Eta was responsible for the assassination
of Spanish Prime Minister Luis Blanco,</i>

365
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,269
<i>returning home from Christmas Mass...</i>

366
00:29:08,104 --> 00:29:13,359
<i>and a remote-controlled car bomb that
killed Defense Minister Alejandro Rivera.</i>

367
00:29:15,903 --> 00:29:19,449
<i>The man behind those bombs?
You guessed it... the Spaniard.</i>

368
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:25,455
<i>Whose real name is Efram Gonzalez,
a celebrity now, for hire.</i>

369
00:29:25,538 --> 00:29:27,624
<i>Expensive, but the best.</i>

370
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:31,127
<i>'Cause Pablo only hires the best.</i>

371
00:29:39,886 --> 00:29:43,389
<i>That was Pablo's plan,
to blow up Gaviria.</i>

372
00:29:43,473 --> 00:29:47,686
<i>The question was,
where, when and how?</i>

373
00:29:48,728 --> 00:29:51,898
I appreciate your concern,
Madam Ambassador,

374
00:29:51,981 --> 00:29:55,902
but canceling our campaign travel
is not an option.

375
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:59,906
Well, given the new information
that Agent Murphy has uncovered,

376
00:29:59,989 --> 00:30:01,741
I hope you'll reconsider.

377
00:30:02,617 --> 00:30:06,037
He has appearances in Cali, Boyacá,
and a dozen other cities.

378
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,955
You are a target in every one.

379
00:30:08,164 --> 00:30:12,627
Yes, and... we've done everything
your Secret Service

380
00:30:12,711 --> 00:30:15,672
and Spain's Civil Guard
have recommended.

381
00:30:15,755 --> 00:30:19,885
We also have bomb-sniffing dogs
at every campaign stop, so...

382
00:30:19,967 --> 00:30:20,967
I think we're good.

383
00:30:21,135 --> 00:30:23,388
You think the Spaniard
doesn't know that?

384
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:26,850
Yes, I know.

385
00:30:26,933 --> 00:30:29,811
But tell me, Agent Murphy,
how do you expect him to win the election

386
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:32,898
if he hides like a scared rabbit
behind all this violence?

387
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,566
Tell me, how?

388
00:30:34,649 --> 00:30:37,151
How do you expect him to win
if he's dead?

389
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,905
I'm not telling your wife
you died on my watch.

390
00:30:40,112 --> 00:30:42,240
This is not your watch, OK?

391
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:49,038
Thank you, Agent Murphy...
but Eduardo's right.

392
00:30:50,456 --> 00:30:52,291
I'll take my chances.

393
00:30:56,796 --> 00:31:00,550
His name is Steve Murphy. He's DEA.

394
00:31:00,633 --> 00:31:02,969
I hope you'll pay for this information.

395
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:16,775
Suárez is talking to the DEA.

396
00:31:19,068 --> 00:31:21,487
You know what you have to do.

397
00:31:54,854 --> 00:31:56,481
He got away.

398
00:31:57,857 --> 00:31:59,943
They killed the goddamn maid.

399
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:04,489
Colonel!

400
00:32:08,117 --> 00:32:09,117
Colonel...

401
00:32:11,287 --> 00:32:12,956
They called from the road block.

402
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,668
They have a car stopped
and they're saying the driver's a senator.

403
00:32:16,751 --> 00:32:19,253
- Does he have his identification?
- Everything checks out.

404
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:20,839
So what's the problem?

405
00:32:21,714 --> 00:32:24,383
They found a machine gun in the trunk.

406
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:26,552
Let's go.

407
00:32:37,522 --> 00:32:39,357
Look at my credentials.

408
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,360
No, I don't know this Gacha person
you're referring to.

409
00:32:43,653 --> 00:32:46,155
Why do you have a gun in the trunk?

410
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:54,080
Gentlemen, are you asking why a politician
in this country carries a weapon?

411
00:32:54,163 --> 00:32:55,874
Please.

412
00:32:55,957 --> 00:32:58,877
- It's my bodyguard's.
- Where's your bodyguard?

413
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,088
You're alone in the car, right?

414
00:33:03,756 --> 00:33:05,758
Listen to me, officers...

415
00:33:05,842 --> 00:33:10,471
if you don't let me go immediately,
you're going to regret it.

416
00:33:11,263 --> 00:33:12,473
Uh-huh.

417
00:33:14,934 --> 00:33:16,227
Thank you.

418
00:33:16,936 --> 00:33:19,564
- Give us a moment.
- Go on.

419
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:24,360
I don't believe him.

420
00:33:24,443 --> 00:33:26,112
I don't either.

421
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,658
He could have bought his credentials.

422
00:33:31,617 --> 00:33:34,245
What if it turns out he is a senator?

423
00:33:34,328 --> 00:33:36,081
We'll pay for that.

424
00:33:38,041 --> 00:33:40,626
I can't run that risk.

425
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:42,545
It's true.

426
00:33:42,628 --> 00:33:44,964
You can't.

427
00:33:48,051 --> 00:33:51,804
The next one...
goes in your head!

428
00:33:51,888 --> 00:33:53,639
- All right, all right!
- Talk, bitch!

429
00:33:53,723 --> 00:33:55,808
I'll talk, I'll talk!

430
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:01,313
I love you, my sweetheart.
I love you.

431
00:34:01,397 --> 00:34:04,400
You have a guest.
It's Don Pablo.

432
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,946
Hey, Jaime.

433
00:34:08,029 --> 00:34:09,614
- Don Pablo.
- This is your house?

434
00:34:09,697 --> 00:34:12,700
- Your family?
- Yes, sir. Welcome.

435
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:14,077
Tell me about them.

436
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,788
This is my daughter Marcela.

437
00:34:16,871 --> 00:34:19,165
Look at what a cute baby.

438
00:34:19,248 --> 00:34:21,960
- How proud you must be.
- Of course I am.

439
00:34:22,043 --> 00:34:23,962
Of course.

440
00:34:24,045 --> 00:34:28,424
Very soon, they will have the money
to buy everything they want, Jaime.

441
00:34:28,507 --> 00:34:30,051
Thanks a lot, boss.

442
00:34:30,135 --> 00:34:32,095
- May I please have a glass of water?
- Of course.

443
00:34:32,137 --> 00:34:33,638
Thank you.

444
00:34:33,721 --> 00:34:34,889
- What about you?
- Good, sir.

445
00:34:34,973 --> 00:34:37,976
- How have you been?
- Good, thank you.

446
00:34:38,893 --> 00:34:39,978
Guys.

447
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:43,314
All right, Jaime.

448
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:47,735
This is for you to wear
during your mission.

449
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,403
Thank you, Ma'am.
Very kind.

450
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,447
Seriously, Pablo?

451
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:53,240
Thank you very much.

452
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:55,409
Everything is so beautiful.

453
00:34:55,493 --> 00:35:00,206
You have to be very careful,
and get by unnoticed.

454
00:35:00,289 --> 00:35:03,501
For sure, sir.
I'm ready to do what you're asking.

455
00:35:03,709 --> 00:35:05,711
All right, then, son.

456
00:35:05,795 --> 00:35:07,254
Sit down.

457
00:35:09,298 --> 00:35:13,552
These guys are going to give you
very specific instructions.

458
00:35:13,636 --> 00:35:16,681
Tomorrow morning, you're boarding
the plane that is leaving for Cali.

459
00:35:16,889 --> 00:35:19,892
We want you to record a conversation.

460
00:35:19,976 --> 00:35:22,728
It's very simple,
nothing to worry about.

461
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:25,690
All right.

462
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,989
- How are you feeling?
- I'm... I'm very happy.

463
00:35:33,072 --> 00:35:36,909
Thank you very much for the opportunity,
Don Pablo. Seriously. And for the clothes.

464
00:35:36,993 --> 00:35:39,745
Really, for me,
it's an honor to work for you.

465
00:35:39,829 --> 00:35:41,497
Thank you very much.

466
00:35:42,707 --> 00:35:44,375
Don't mention it.

467
00:35:46,044 --> 00:35:47,503
OK.

468
00:35:47,586 --> 00:35:50,131
Come here, give me a hug.

469
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:53,592
Thank you, Don Pablo.

470
00:35:54,969 --> 00:35:56,512
Thank you.

471
00:35:57,513 --> 00:35:59,682
- Ma'am, have a good night.
- Take care.

472
00:35:59,765 --> 00:36:01,392
Thank you very much.

473
00:36:01,475 --> 00:36:03,144
See you later, boys.

474
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:05,437
- Take care.
- Yes, sir.

475
00:36:05,521 --> 00:36:07,982
My love, look!

476
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:12,444
- Look at this jacket. Beautiful, right?
- It's beautiful. What did Pablo say?

477
00:36:12,528 --> 00:36:16,032
You know what?
We're going to get ahead.

478
00:36:17,408 --> 00:36:21,120
You, me and the baby
are going to get ahead.

479
00:36:21,204 --> 00:36:22,538
Thank you, my love.

480
00:36:22,621 --> 00:36:25,291
- Look at this.
- Let's go try it on.

481
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:31,380
I have some news about Gaviria.

482
00:36:31,463 --> 00:36:34,217
They're going to kill him
on the way to Cali.

483
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:38,512
Did you say Cali?
Hey, can I get a translate in here?

484
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:40,223
Suárez, OK.

485
00:36:40,306 --> 00:36:41,599
I can translate.

486
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,395
Wait a moment.
Someone is at the door.

487
00:36:46,604 --> 00:36:49,107
<i>"Tu puerta"?</i>

488
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:51,067
- "Door."
- Door.

489
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:53,861
Suárez! Suárez.

490
00:37:02,245 --> 00:37:04,247
Pablo doesn't like you talking to the DEA.

491
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:09,252
<i>Suárez!</i>

492
00:37:09,335 --> 00:37:11,712
<i>Talk to me, you bastard.
Suárez, hello?</i>

493
00:37:12,421 --> 00:37:14,257
Hello?

494
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,424
Hel...

495
00:37:17,509 --> 00:37:19,428
- I want that call.
- Right away, sir.

496
00:37:25,935 --> 00:37:29,814
<i>Carrillo and his men
arrived in Tolu to kill Gacha.</i>

497
00:37:29,897 --> 00:37:32,483
<i>And Peña still hoped
he could be taken alive.</i>

498
00:37:49,334 --> 00:37:51,043
It was her fault, Dad.

499
00:37:51,127 --> 00:37:54,546
Are you still thinking about that?
Let it go, son.

500
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:58,592
All she had to do was say yes
and I wouldn't have had to shoot her!

501
00:37:58,676 --> 00:37:59,969
Be a man!

502
00:38:29,248 --> 00:38:31,083
Son of a bitch!
They found us!

503
00:38:53,356 --> 00:38:55,774
Come on, son!

504
00:39:37,316 --> 00:39:40,194
- Sir, are you OK?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

505
00:39:40,278 --> 00:39:42,529
- He's trying to get away!
- He won't get away.

506
00:39:42,613 --> 00:39:44,365
Get me a radio, quick!

507
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:46,575
Correal, bring a radio!
Correal! A radio!

508
00:39:47,743 --> 00:39:51,122
Dad, let's go! Hurry, Dad, hurry!

509
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:55,167
Hurry!

510
00:40:04,385 --> 00:40:05,386
Stop!

511
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:24,071
Peña!
Gacha is in a red Chevy pick-up!

512
00:40:30,035 --> 00:40:32,746
What did I tell you?
We got out OK.

513
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:35,458
- I'm scared.
- Scared of what?

514
00:40:35,541 --> 00:40:37,376
You're a wolf, right?

515
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,545
Yes, I am a wolf.

516
00:40:48,513 --> 00:40:51,182
It's a helicopter! It's a
helicopter! They're going to kill us!

517
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:53,642
Nobody is going to kill us!
Don't talk like that!

518
00:40:53,725 --> 00:40:55,644
Take this. Take it!

519
00:40:59,898 --> 00:41:02,568
- I have a Chevy in sight.
- Stop him!

520
00:41:02,776 --> 00:41:05,946
<i>Don't let him get away!
Try and disable the vehicle!</i>

521
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:27,759
<i>No good.
We're going in again.</i>

522
00:41:27,843 --> 00:41:30,679
Stop him!
Do whatever you have to do!

523
00:41:34,099 --> 00:41:38,270
- Don't leave me alone, Dad.
- No, no. Never, son, never!

524
00:41:38,354 --> 00:41:41,148
Breathe! Breathe!

525
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:43,275
Do you want this, asshole?

526
00:41:43,484 --> 00:41:44,902
Do you want this?

527
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:46,195
We're taking fire!

528
00:41:46,278 --> 00:41:48,864
We'll circle around
and approach from another direction.

529
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:53,202
You don't need to worry about anything,
my son. Nothing.

530
00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:56,872
<i>Don't take any chances!
We can't afford to lose him!</i>

531
00:41:56,955 --> 00:41:58,123
Copy.

532
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:03,170
Look. Look outside. Look outside!

533
00:42:07,633 --> 00:42:10,428
<i>What's happening?
Peña, what's happening?</i>

534
00:42:17,684 --> 00:42:20,396
We stopped him.
He's not moving.

535
00:42:23,649 --> 00:42:25,401
Freddy. Freddy?

536
00:42:25,484 --> 00:42:27,319
Let's go, Freddy.

537
00:42:28,028 --> 00:42:29,238
Freddy?

538
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:31,449
Freddy?

539
00:42:31,532 --> 00:42:33,325
Son!

540
00:42:39,081 --> 00:42:41,833
You're a wolf. You're a wolf.

541
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:46,631
Asshole!

542
00:42:46,713 --> 00:42:49,675
Asshole! Hey, asshole!

543
00:42:49,841 --> 00:42:51,636
Freddy! Wake up, Freddy!

544
00:42:53,429 --> 00:42:55,431
Hey, asshole! What are you gonna do?

545
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:58,434
What are you gonna do?
Asshole!

546
00:42:58,643 --> 00:43:01,853
What are you gonna do?!
Asshole!

547
00:43:04,315 --> 00:43:07,318
<i>He's out of bullets.
We can take him alive.</i>

548
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:11,905
<i>It's your call.</i>

549
00:43:14,575 --> 00:43:17,161
What are you gonna do?!
Asshole!

550
00:43:20,706 --> 00:43:22,166
Give him lead.

551
00:43:42,436 --> 00:43:46,982
Affirmative. Maintain positions
and patrol the area again. Very good.

552
00:44:00,412 --> 00:44:01,788
Are you OK?

553
00:44:02,707 --> 00:44:04,625
I'll sleep tonight.

554
00:44:10,172 --> 00:44:14,552
<i>This was the first successful
major operation by the Search Bloc.</i>

555
00:44:14,635 --> 00:44:16,803
<i>It signaled to the country
and to the world</i>

556
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:20,224
<i>that the fight against the narcos
had moved to a new level.</i>

557
00:44:21,517 --> 00:44:24,562
According
to recent polls, we're doing well.

558
00:44:24,645 --> 00:44:27,439
We're gaining points
in six districts within Cali.

559
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:31,694
That's important,
because it means we could pull ahead.

560
00:44:31,777 --> 00:44:34,780
- Don't put too much faith in the polls.
- I know.

561
00:44:34,863 --> 00:44:37,783
The last time,
we fell five points in one day.

562
00:44:37,866 --> 00:44:39,702
- Yes. We...
- Dr. Gaviria!

563
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:41,470
Stop him!
Sir, we can't let you through!

564
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:43,497
Relax. Let him through.

565
00:44:46,542 --> 00:44:49,211
- Agent Murphy.
- What are you doing here?

566
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:53,173
- No, no. He can't go, no.
- What?

567
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:57,886
There's gonna be a bomb waiting.
He goes, he dies.

568
00:44:57,969 --> 00:44:59,930
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you talking about?

569
00:45:00,138 --> 00:45:04,893
This is your job, your call.
But I know something's gonna go down.

570
00:45:04,976 --> 00:45:06,562
Do you have proof?

571
00:45:07,605 --> 00:45:10,315
I got my gut.

572
00:45:10,399 --> 00:45:12,067
You got your gut.

573
00:45:14,861 --> 00:45:18,240
- What if you're wrong?
- I hope to God I am.

574
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:20,409
What if I'm right?

575
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:30,001
You nervous?

576
00:45:30,085 --> 00:45:32,463
A little bit, but I'm fine.

577
00:45:32,546 --> 00:45:34,423
Wait here, wait here.

578
00:45:34,506 --> 00:45:36,634
You know what you have to do?

579
00:45:36,717 --> 00:45:38,510
Yes, sir.

580
00:45:42,013 --> 00:45:45,810
Remember, you have to record
the entire conversation. Don't forget.

581
00:45:46,017 --> 00:45:49,480
- No, sir.
- Have a nice flight.

582
00:45:49,563 --> 00:45:51,482
Aren't you coming with me?

583
00:45:51,565 --> 00:45:56,695
No, the boss just told me
to bring you here.

584
00:45:56,779 --> 00:45:58,905
Hey, but don't worry.

585
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:01,617
Tomorrow,
I'll come and meet you there.

586
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:05,830
- All right, then.
- All right. Don't be nervous.

587
00:46:05,912 --> 00:46:07,748
You'll see how fun it is to fly.

588
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:10,292
All right?

589
00:46:11,126 --> 00:46:13,838
Go on. The line is right there.

590
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,798
Good luck, then.

591
00:46:24,139 --> 00:46:26,266
It's up to you, Eduardo.

592
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:29,019
Whatever you decide, I'll do.

593
00:46:30,103 --> 00:46:34,107
<i>Avianca announces

595

I'll organize the exit.
You guys stay with him.

Well... it seems like
you and I are not the only ones afraid.

598
00:47:06,765 --> 00:47:08,975
Put on your seatbelt, please.
