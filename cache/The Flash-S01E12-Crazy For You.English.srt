<i>When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.</i>

00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,972
<i>My father went to prison for her murder.</i>

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:17,350
<i>Then an accident
made me the impossible.</i>

00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,811
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...</i>

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,483
<i>...but secretly, I use my speed to fight crime
and find others like me.</i>

Cisco, if you don't seal off the blast, people
in this building will die, including Caitlin.

11
00:00:39,954 --> 00:00:42,373
-Don't look for me again.
CAITLIN: Ronnie's alive.

12
00:00:42,581 --> 00:00:44,833
And he's out there, alone and scared.

13
00:00:45,042 --> 00:00:48,712
Hartley Rathaway. One of the finest
scientific minds I've ever encountered.

00:00:48,921 --> 00:00:51,632
HARTLEY: Can't imagine how
you're gonna feel when you let me out.

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,634
Why would I ever do that?

16
00:00:53,842 --> 00:00:56,512
Because I know where Ronnie Raymond is.

17
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:06,564
Honey. Honey.

How did...?

33
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,454
I love you.

34
00:02:10,246 --> 00:02:12,582
Thank you, Flash.

35
00:02:21,424 --> 00:02:23,885 X1:0
Dude, that was insane.

36
00:02:24,093 --> 00:02:28,556 X1:0
I mean, even I'm having a hard time
getting mad at you for dirtying up my suit.

37
00:02:28,765 --> 00:02:30,641
When are we gonna consider it my suit?

38
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:33,977 X1:0
-I'd be comfortable calling it our suit.
-Okay. Our suit.

39
00:02:34,144 --> 00:02:36,897 X1:0
Tonight was the fastest you've ever run.

40
00:02:37,105 --> 00:02:41,151
Yes, your training is paying off.
That couple is alive tonight because of you.

41
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,278
I can still get faster. I know I can.

42
00:02:43,487 --> 00:02:48,992 X1:0
And you will one day. But for today,
I'd say you fulfilled your saved quota.

43
00:02:49,201 --> 00:02:52,204 X1:0
Proper rest is what you need, as do we all.

44

Better yet, what we all need is
a proper drink. Who's up for a round?

00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:01,921 X1:0
Dude, it's movie night with Joe. I can't.
But I'll see you guys tomorrow, all right?

You okay?

50
00:03:12,597 --> 00:03:17,143 X1:0
I was looking for my tablet
at your workstation, and I found this.

51
00:03:17,352 --> 00:03:23,858
You said we should stop looking for
Ronnie, so I didn't stop looking for Ronnie.

52
00:03:24,067 --> 00:03:25,235
Why?

53
00:03:25,443 --> 00:03:28,446
Hartley, he said he knew
what happened to Ronnie.

54
00:03:28,655 --> 00:03:30,824 X1:0
Hartley Rathaway?
Who is currently locked up...

55
00:03:31,032 --> 00:03:33,660
...in our villain jail for going psycho
with sound waves?

56
00:03:33,868 --> 00:03:36,453 X1:0
Yeah, he's made some poor choices.
No argument there.

57
00:03:36,662 --> 00:03:39,831 X1:0
-But I looked into what he was saying and--
-Cisco, Ronnie's gone.

58
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:42,624 X1:0
And it's time for me to move on with my life.

59
00:03:44,543 --> 00:03:45,835
Doesn't seem like it.

60
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:48,837 X1:0
What's that supposed to mean?

61
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:52,632 X1:0
Look, I'm not an expert on love.

62
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:56,678 X1:0
But I think in order to move on
from Ronnie...

63
00:03:56,886 --> 00:03:59,931 X1:0
...you actually have to move on.

64
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:50,815

-How did you do that?

00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,293

00:05:24,597 --> 00:05:27,850

-So you like?

00:05:28,059 --> 00:05:29,559

in half the prison are shut down.

00:05:47,744 --> 00:05:53,625 X1:0
Then Clay Parker, according to this log, who
was locked in his cell, somehow vanishes.

77
00:05:53,834 --> 00:05:55,544 X1:0
Not completely.

78
00:05:57,087 --> 00:06:00,632 X1:0
-What's that?
-It's a kind of organic particulate residual.

79
00:06:00,841 --> 00:06:05,095 X1:0
I found it on the floor in here,
just outside the cell, out in the hallway.

80
00:06:05,303 --> 00:06:07,347
The trail led me all the way outside.

81
00:06:11,017 --> 00:06:12,561
Dad.

82
00:06:24,781 --> 00:06:29,202 X1:0
So word around here is
Parker pulled a <i>Shawshank?</i>

83
00:06:29,703 --> 00:06:33,915
Yep. And none of the other prisoners
heard or saw anything.

84
00:06:34,124 --> 00:06:36,585 X1:0
They wouldn't talk to you about it.

85
00:06:36,877 --> 00:06:39,754 X1:0
Leaves us with not a lot to go on.

86
00:06:39,963 --> 00:06:44,759
Well, if there's anyone who could figure out
how Parker got out of here, it's you, son.

87
00:06:45,385 --> 00:06:49,180 X1:0
GUARD: Come on, Allen. Let's go.
-Duty calls.

88
00:06:58,064 --> 00:07:01,318 X1:0
So my dad just happened to come by?

89
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,528
The guard owed me a favor.

90
00:07:05,071 --> 00:07:06,781 X1:0
Thank you.

91
00:07:12,912 --> 00:07:17,666
Thanks for getting me out of that hell hole.

92
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,667
You would have done the same, right?

93
00:07:20,126 --> 00:07:21,586
So...

94
00:07:23,462 --> 00:07:26,924
-...how the hell did this happen to you?
-Don't know.

95
00:07:27,132 --> 00:07:30,509
After you got locked up,
I started not feeling right.

96
00:07:30,718 --> 00:07:34,388
I was passing out for no reason.
Waking up in odd places.

97
00:07:34,597 --> 00:07:37,350
Took me a while before I could control it.

98
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:40,394
As soon as I could...

99
00:07:43,064 --> 00:07:44,440
...I came for you.

100
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:48,361
So you can just jump wherever you want?

101
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:52,239
If I can see where I'm going.
We got a second chance, Clay.

102
00:07:52,448 --> 00:07:57,244
We can leave Central City.
Do all the things we talked about.

103
00:07:58,996 --> 00:08:01,499
I can't leave yet, baby.

104
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,918
I owe Marcus a lot of money.

105
00:08:05,126 --> 00:08:08,338
I skip town before paying him back,
he'll find us.

106
00:08:09,214 --> 00:08:11,633
But with what you can do...

107
00:08:12,258 --> 00:08:15,053
...we can pay off that debt.

108
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:19,474
Then we'll be free
and we can go anywhere in the world.

109
00:08:19,808 --> 00:08:21,518
Together.

110
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:32,278
Not even Barry's cells move this fast.
I've never seen anything like it.

111
00:08:32,487 --> 00:08:34,239
So Clay Parker is a metahuman?

112
00:08:34,698 --> 00:08:38,659
Not so fast.
The particulate residue that Barry gathered...

113
00:08:38,867 --> 00:08:43,830
...at Iron Heights does contain Clay Parker's
DNA but also DNA of a woman.

114
00:08:44,038 --> 00:08:47,542
BARRY: Run her DNA against the C.C.P.D.
criminal database. See if you get a match.

115
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,799
Yahtzee. Her name's Shawna Baez.

116
00:08:55,008 --> 00:08:58,678
Mostly petty crimes,
and this girl likes to party, apparently.

117
00:08:58,886 --> 00:09:00,972
Along list of disorderly conducts at bars.

118
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,433
So I'm guessing we find her,
we find Clay Parker.

119
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:05,101
-Barry?
-Yeah.

120
00:09:05,268 --> 00:09:08,563
In the meantime, let's track
these particulates and see how they work.

121
00:09:09,814 --> 00:09:11,690
I'll be right with you guys.

122
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:21,033
I have had the biggest craving for Thai food.

123
00:09:21,241 --> 00:09:23,577
You said you knew
what happened to Ronnie.

124
00:09:24,036 --> 00:09:25,579
And how he was still alive.

125
00:09:25,787 --> 00:09:29,833
And you said Professor Stein was at
S.T.A.R. Labs the night of the explosion.

126
00:09:30,042 --> 00:09:32,461
Yes, he was.

127
00:09:33,378 --> 00:09:35,088
Why?

128
00:09:38,133 --> 00:09:42,929
The mystery isn't why Stein
went to S.T.A.R. Labs that night.

129
00:09:43,764 --> 00:09:45,432
It's why he didn't leave.

130
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,437
-Tell me.
-Can't. Have to show you.

Fair enough. But I know you, Cisco.

He was like family.

I know how much
you wanna see that family healed.

00:10:39,902 --> 00:10:41,654
I saw my dad today.

143
00:10:41,904 --> 00:10:45,908
No glass. No phones. Just me
and him face-to-face. Joe arranged it.

-Yeah. I really needed it.

00:10:55,751 --> 00:11:00,172
-Mm-hm.
-That is a big story which I am not a part of.

148
00:11:00,422 --> 00:11:03,634
My editor wants me writing
about the Flash and only the Flash.

-I don't know.

as more than the Flash PR flack.

I think I might lose my job.

to write about. Together.

I didn't know you enjoyed
a bit of rough trade.

I'm not taking any chances.

00:11:40,003 --> 00:11:43,131
Curiosity's a maddening thing, is it not?

158
00:11:47,135 --> 00:11:49,304
BARRY: What do you mean,
you've been asking around?

159
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,055
Do you know a Marcus Stockheimer?

160
00:11:54,474 --> 00:11:57,519
Sure. He's some midlevel gangster.
Works mainly on the south side.

161
00:11:57,728 --> 00:12:00,397
Word is Clay Parker
was a runner for Marcus.

162
00:12:00,606 --> 00:12:05,194
When Clay got pinched, Marcus lost a lot of
money. Marcus doesn't like losing money.

163
00:12:06,028 --> 00:12:09,323
So Parker can't leave Central City
until he's paid off his debt?

164
00:12:09,531 --> 00:12:13,327
From what I'm told, if you're a member
of the Stockheimer crew, you get out...

165
00:12:13,869 --> 00:12:17,915
...first thing you do is pay them a visit

It's impossible. It's one-way glass.
It's mirrored on the inside.

gonna get out of this thing again.

And we need to catch him.

Why are you giving this to me?

533

I saw him once in here.

Watched him save Joe's life.

560
00:39:11,327 --> 00:39:13,413
Joe told me about that.
I guess he was lucky.

Next thing I know, Julius is caught trying
to escape. Claims the Flash broke him out.

565
00:39:28,553 --> 00:39:31,765
Won't be seeing Julius for a long time now.

Yeah.

00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:55,868
Well, if the Flash were my son,
I'd tell him a few things.

572
00:39:56,118 --> 00:39:59,997
First off, I'd tell him
it's a dangerous world, so be careful.

573
00:40:02,833 --> 00:40:05,169
Then I'd tell him he's a hero.

And he's saving a lot of lives.

575
00:40:08,881 --> 00:40:14,136
But the most important thing
for him to know, I feel...

576
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:17,348
...is that his father's proud of him.
