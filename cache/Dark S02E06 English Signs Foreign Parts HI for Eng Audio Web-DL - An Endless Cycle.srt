1
00:02:43,963 --> 00:02:46,171
Somehow, sometime

2
00:02:46,255 --> 00:02:48,588
The future starts somewhere

3
00:02:48,671 --> 00:02:51,005
I won't wait much longer now

4
00:02:53,171 --> 00:02:56,921
Love is created through bravery
So don't think about it twice

5
00:02:57,005 --> 00:03:01,296
We ride on fiery wheels
Towards the future through the night

6
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:15,338
JUNE 20, 2019

7
00:06:15,421 --> 00:06:22,088
THE DAY BEFORE
MICHAEL COMMITS SUICIDE

8
00:08:27,505 --> 00:08:29,255
MURDER IN MARBURG UNSOLVED
33 YEARS LATER

9
00:08:29,338 --> 00:08:30,921
SEARCH FOR TWO FUGITIVE PERPS
STILL ON

10
00:15:26,838 --> 00:15:29,088
ARIADNE
A STAGE PLAY

11
00:25:26,505 --> 00:25:30,421
MURDER IN MARBURG UNSOLVED
33 YEARS LATER

12
00:25:41,921 --> 00:25:45,213
Give me your hand
I'll build a castle out of sand for you

13
00:25:45,296 --> 00:25:50,255
Somehow, somewhere, somewhen

14
00:25:51,255 --> 00:25:54,963
The time has come
For some tenderness tonight

15
00:25:55,046 --> 00:25:59,213
Somehow, somewhere, somewhen

16
00:33:40,255 --> 00:33:43,255
DO NOT OPEN BEFORE NOVEMBER 4,
10:13 P.M.

17
00:50:51,213 --> 00:50:53,046
