00:02:32,047 --> 00:02:34,379
- You all right?
- Mm.

5
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,588
Ever been north before?

6
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:38,254
Never seen snow before.

7
00:02:38,255 --> 00:02:40,129
Beautiful, eh?

8
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,671
I can breathe again.

9
00:02:41,672 --> 00:02:43,838
Down south, the air
smells like pig shit.

10
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:45,463
You've never been down south.

11
00:02:45,464 --> 00:02:47,379
- I've been to Winterfell.
- That's the North.

00:02:48,797 --> 00:02:50,921
GENDRY: How do you live up here?

14
00:02:50,922 --> 00:02:52,796
How do you keep your
balls from freezing off?

15
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:55,296
TORMUND: You got to keep moving.
That's the secret.

16
00:02:55,297 --> 00:02:59,338
Walking's good, fighting's
better, fucking's best.

17
00:02:59,339 --> 00:03:02,796
There's not a living woman
within a hundred miles of here.

18
00:03:02,797 --> 00:03:05,172
We have to make do with what we've got.

19
00:03:10,797 --> 00:03:13,379
This one is maybe not so smart.

20
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,296
Davos says he's a strong fighter.

21
00:03:15,297 --> 00:03:18,796
Good. That's more important
than being smart.

22
00:03:18,797 --> 00:03:22,005
Smart people don't come up
here looking for the dead.

23
00:03:23,547 --> 00:03:26,838
TORMUND: So, you met
this Dragon Queen, huh?

24
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,212
And?

25
00:03:28,213 --> 00:03:31,588
She'll only fight beside
us if I bend the knee.

26
00:03:31,589 --> 00:03:34,004
You spent too much time
with the Free Folk.

27
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,714
Now you don't like kneeling.

28
00:03:38,672 --> 00:03:41,004
Mance Rayder was a brave man.

29
00:03:41,005 --> 00:03:42,838
A proud man.

30
00:03:42,839 --> 00:03:46,672
The King-beyond-the-Wall
never bent the knee.

31
00:03:48,005 --> 00:03:51,672
How many of his people
died for his pride?

32
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:07,004
You still mad at us, boy?

33
00:04:07,005 --> 00:04:09,046
You sold me to a witch.

34
00:04:09,047 --> 00:04:10,463
A priestess.

35
00:04:10,464 --> 00:04:13,379
I'll admit, it is a subtle distinction.

36
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,546
We're fighting a great war.
Wars cost money.

37
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,421
I wanted to be one of you.

38
00:04:18,422 --> 00:04:21,463
I wanted to join the
Brotherhood, but you sold me off

39
00:04:21,464 --> 00:04:23,421
like a slave.

40
00:04:23,422 --> 00:04:25,421
Do you know what she did to me?

41
00:04:25,422 --> 00:04:27,004
She strapped me down on a bed,

42
00:04:27,005 --> 00:04:29,838
- she stripped me naked...
- Sounds all right so far.

43
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:32,588
- and put leeches on me.
- Was she naked, too?

44
00:04:32,589 --> 00:04:34,046
She needed your blood.

45
00:04:34,047 --> 00:04:35,713
Yes, thank you. I know that.

46
00:04:35,714 --> 00:04:38,671
- Could have been worse.
- She wanted to kill me!

47
00:04:38,672 --> 00:04:40,707
They would have killed
me if wasn't for Davos.

48
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:42,672
But they didn't, did they?

49
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,588
So, what you whinging about?

50
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:46,254
I'm not whinging.

51
00:04:46,255 --> 00:04:49,212
Your lips are moving and you're
complaining about something.

52
00:04:49,213 --> 00:04:51,254
That's whinging.

53
00:04:51,255 --> 00:04:53,046
This one's been killed six times.

54
00:04:53,047 --> 00:04:54,756
You don't hear him bitching about it.

55
00:05:04,963 --> 00:05:06,380
Good lad.

56
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:14,588
JON: The first time I went north
of the Wall was with your father.

57
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:16,212
He was a good man.

58
00:05:16,213 --> 00:05:19,338
He deserved a better son.

59
00:05:19,339 --> 00:05:21,379
Were you with him at the end?

60
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:24,463
I was a prisoner of the wildlings.

61
00:05:24,464 --> 00:05:26,463
But we avenged him.

62
00:05:26,464 --> 00:05:27,962
I want you to know that.

63
00:05:27,963 --> 00:05:30,962
Every mutineer found justice.

64
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:33,796
Can't think of a worse
way for him to go.

65
00:05:33,797 --> 00:05:35,296
The Night's Watch was his life.

66
00:05:35,297 --> 00:05:38,129
He would have died to protect
every one of those men.

67
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,588
And they butchered him.

68
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,796
I hate that he died that way.

69
00:05:42,797 --> 00:05:45,463
My father was the most
honorable man I ever met.

70
00:05:45,464 --> 00:05:48,254
He was good all the way through.

71
00:05:48,255 --> 00:05:51,504
And he died on the executioner's block.

72
00:05:51,505 --> 00:05:55,671
Your father wanted to
execute me, you know?

73
00:05:55,672 --> 00:05:57,212
I heard.

74
00:05:57,213 --> 00:05:59,504
He was in the right, of course.

75
00:05:59,505 --> 00:06:02,004
Didn't make me hate him any less.

76
00:06:02,005 --> 00:06:05,005
- I'm glad he didn't catch you.
- Me, too.

77
00:06:13,505 --> 00:06:15,254
Your father gave me this sword.

78
00:06:15,255 --> 00:06:18,797
Changed the pommel from
a bear to a wolf...

79
00:06:22,464 --> 00:06:24,047
but it's still Longclaw.

80
00:06:30,464 --> 00:06:32,338
Lord Commander Mormont

81
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:34,963
thought you'd never
come back to Westeros.

82
00:06:36,464 --> 00:06:38,838
But you are back,

83
00:06:38,839 --> 00:06:42,796
and it's been in your
family for centuries.

84
00:06:42,797 --> 00:06:44,589
It's not right for me to have it.

85
00:06:48,213 --> 00:06:50,171
He gave it to you.

86
00:06:50,172 --> 00:06:52,380
I'm not his son.

87
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,547
I brought shame onto my house.

88
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,255
I broke my father's heart.

89
00:07:07,047 --> 00:07:09,547
I forfeited the right
to claim this sword.

90
00:07:11,714 --> 00:07:13,379
It's yours.

91
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,505
May it serve you well...

92
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:18,547
and your children after you.

(CHATTER)

95
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,254
Father used to watch us from up here.

96
00:07:47,255 --> 00:07:49,755
He wouldn't say much.

97
00:07:49,756 --> 00:07:51,129
You probably don't remember.

98
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:53,130
You were inside knitting all the time.

99
00:07:54,464 --> 00:07:55,881
I remember.

100
00:07:58,005 --> 00:08:00,963
One time, the boys were shooting
arrows with Ser Rodrik.

101
00:08:02,297 --> 00:08:04,588
I came out here after,

102
00:08:04,589 --> 00:08:06,838
and Bran had left his bow behind,

103
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:09,463
just lying on the ground.

104
00:08:09,464 --> 00:08:11,839
Ser Rodrik would have
cuffed him if he saw.

105
00:08:14,339 --> 00:08:17,421
There was one arrow in the target.

106
00:08:17,422 --> 00:08:21,087
There was no one around, just like now.

107
00:08:21,088 --> 00:08:22,963
No one to stop me.

108
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:26,588
So I started shooting.

109
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,962
And every shot, I had to go up there

110
00:08:28,963 --> 00:08:32,255
and get my one arrow and walk
back and shoot it again.

111
00:08:33,756 --> 00:08:35,505
I wasn't very good.

112
00:08:37,047 --> 00:08:40,046
Finally, I hit the bull's-eye.

113
00:08:40,047 --> 00:08:42,463
Could have been the
20th shot or the 50th.

114
00:08:42,464 --> 00:08:43,921
I don't remember.

115
00:08:43,922 --> 00:08:47,339
But I hit the bull's-eye,
and I heard this.

116
00:08:49,756 --> 00:08:51,254
I looked up,

117
00:08:51,255 --> 00:08:53,004
and he's standing right here,

118
00:08:53,005 --> 00:08:54,672
smiling down at me.

119
00:08:57,172 --> 00:09:00,254
I knew what I was doing
was against the rules.

120
00:09:00,255 --> 00:09:04,671
But he was smiling, so I
knew it wasn't wrong.

121
00:09:04,672 --> 00:09:06,213
The rules were wrong.

122
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,881
I was doing what I was meant
to be doing, and he knew it.

123
00:09:13,756 --> 00:09:15,505
Now he's dead.

124
00:09:17,005 --> 00:09:19,254
Killed by the Lannisters

125
00:09:19,255 --> 00:09:20,881
with your help.

126
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:25,947
What?

127
00:09:35,547 --> 00:09:37,755
That's your pretty handwriting.

128
00:09:37,756 --> 00:09:39,588
Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles

129
00:09:39,589 --> 00:09:41,339
'cause I couldn't write as well as you.

130
00:09:43,422 --> 00:09:47,379
"Robb, I write to you
today with heavy heart.

131
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,546
Our good King Robert is dead,

132
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:51,379
killed from wounds he
took in a boar hunt."

133
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,880
You don't have to read it. I remember.

134
00:09:52,881 --> 00:09:54,588
"Father has been charged with treason.

135
00:09:54,589 --> 00:09:57,546
He conspired with Robert's brothers
against my beloved Joffrey

136
00:09:57,547 --> 00:09:59,379
and tried to steal his throne.

137
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,212
The Lannisters are treating me well

138
00:10:01,213 --> 00:10:03,212
and providing me with every comfort.

139
00:10:03,213 --> 00:10:05,546
I beg you, come to King's Landing,

140
00:10:05,547 --> 00:10:07,421
swear fealty to King Joffrey,

141
00:10:07,422 --> 00:10:09,630
and prevent any strife
between the great houses

142
00:10:09,631 --> 00:10:11,421
of Lannister and Stark.

143
00:10:11,422 --> 00:10:13,630
Your faithful sister, Sansa."

144
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,046
They forced me to do it.

145
00:10:16,047 --> 00:10:17,212
Did they?

146
00:10:17,213 --> 00:10:19,504
With a knife at your throat?

147
00:10:19,505 --> 00:10:20,962
Did they put you on a
rack and stretch you

148
00:10:20,963 --> 00:10:22,671
until your bones started to pop?

149
00:10:22,672 --> 00:10:24,588
You don't know what it was like.
I was a child.

150
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:28,421
So was I. I would have let them kill
me before I betrayed my family.

151
00:10:28,422 --> 00:10:31,254
They told me it was the
only way to save Father.

152
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,797
And you were stupid
enough to believe them.

153
00:10:35,547 --> 00:10:38,755
I remember you standing on that
platform with Joffrey and Cersei

154
00:10:38,756 --> 00:10:40,463
when they dragged Father to the block.

155
00:10:40,464 --> 00:10:42,087
I remember the pretty
dress you were wearing.

156
00:10:42,088 --> 00:10:44,464
I remember the fancy
way you did your hair.

157
00:10:46,297 --> 00:10:47,421
You were there?

158
00:10:47,422 --> 00:10:48,713
I was there.

159
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:51,588
Standing in the crowd
near Baelor's statue.

160
00:10:51,589 --> 00:10:53,379
And what did you do?

161
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,796
Did you come running to the rescue?

162
00:10:55,797 --> 00:10:58,588
Did you fight off the
Lannisters and save Father?

163
00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:01,212
- I wanted to.
- But you didn't, just like me.

164
00:11:01,213 --> 00:11:03,796
I didn't betray him. I
didn't betray Robb.

165
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:07,464
I didn't betray our entire
family for my beloved Joffrey.

166
00:11:09,797 --> 00:11:12,796
You should be on your
knees, thanking me.

167
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:16,671
We're standing in Winterfell
again because of me.

168
00:11:16,672 --> 00:11:18,880
You didn't win it back,
Jon didn't win it back.

169
00:11:18,881 --> 00:11:20,962
He lost the Battle of the Bastards.

170
00:11:20,963 --> 00:11:22,713
The Knights of the Vale won the battle,

171
00:11:22,714 --> 00:11:24,338
and they rode north for me.

172
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:27,630
While you were off, where?
Traveling the world?

173
00:11:27,631 --> 00:11:30,463
- I was training.
- Training.

174
00:11:30,464 --> 00:11:32,338
Well, while you were training,

175
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:35,588
I suffered things you
could never imagine.

176
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:38,213
Oh, I don't know about that.
I can imagine quite a lot.

177
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:42,962
You never would have
survived what I survived.

178
00:11:42,963 --> 00:11:45,547
I guess we'll never know.

179
00:11:49,672 --> 00:11:51,505
What are you going to
do with that letter?

180
00:11:53,005 --> 00:11:54,464
I don't know yet.

181
00:11:56,005 --> 00:11:58,796
Who did you show it to?
Where did you find it?

182
00:11:58,797 --> 00:12:00,880
You're scared, aren't you?

183
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:03,004
What are you scared of?

184
00:12:03,005 --> 00:12:05,004
You didn't commit any crimes.

185
00:12:05,005 --> 00:12:06,838
- No one's going to hang you.
- Well, Arya...

186
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:09,296
You're scared I'll show it
to Jon and he'll be angry.

187
00:12:09,297 --> 00:12:12,671
No, that's not Jon. He'll understand.

188
00:12:12,672 --> 00:12:14,630
You were just a scared little girl,

189
00:12:14,631 --> 00:12:16,838
all alone with the wicked Lannisters.

190
00:12:16,839 --> 00:12:20,713
Do you know how happy Cersei would
be right now if she saw us fighting?

191
00:12:20,714 --> 00:12:22,713
This is exactly what she wants.

192
00:12:22,714 --> 00:12:24,796
This is what she's always
wanted... to tear us apart.

193
00:12:24,797 --> 00:12:27,380
You're scared the Northern
lords will read it.

194
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:30,588
They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa

195
00:12:30,589 --> 00:12:33,588
if they knew how she
did Cersei's bidding.

196
00:12:33,589 --> 00:12:36,588
What would little Lyanna Mormont say?

197
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,755
She's younger than you
were when you wrote this.

198
00:12:39,756 --> 00:12:42,255
Are you going to say,
"But I was just a child?"

199
00:12:44,963 --> 00:12:46,838
You're angry.

200
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:50,046
Sometimes anger makes people
do unfortunate things.

201
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,672
Sometimes fear makes them
do unfortunate things.

202
00:12:54,672 --> 00:12:56,547
I'll go with anger.

203
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,463
You're the one they call "the Dog."

204
00:13:29,464 --> 00:13:31,296
- Fuck off.
- (CHUCKLES)

205
00:13:31,297 --> 00:13:33,087
They told me you were mean.

206
00:13:33,088 --> 00:13:35,504
Were you born mean or
you just hate wildings?

207
00:13:35,505 --> 00:13:37,880
I don't give two shits about wildings.

208
00:13:37,881 --> 00:13:39,588
It's gingers I hate.

209
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:41,463
Gingers are beautiful.

210
00:13:41,464 --> 00:13:45,046
We are kissed by fire, just like you.

211
00:13:45,047 --> 00:13:47,963
Don't point your fucking finger at me.

212
00:13:52,213 --> 00:13:55,338
Did you trip into the fire
when you were a baby?

213
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:57,087
I didn't trip, I was pushed.

214
00:13:57,088 --> 00:13:59,004
And ever since, you've been mean.

215
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,630
Will you fuck off?

216
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,588
I don't think you're truly mean.

217
00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:04,130
You have sad eyes.

218
00:14:05,422 --> 00:14:07,129
You want to suck my dick, is that it?

219
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:09,838
- Dick?
- Cock.

220
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,838
Ah, dick.

221
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,129
I like it.

222
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,171
I bet you do.

223
00:14:15,172 --> 00:14:17,796
Nope, it's pussy for me.

224
00:14:17,797 --> 00:14:20,796
I have a beauty waiting for
me back at Winterfell.

225
00:14:20,797 --> 00:14:22,921
If I ever get back there.

226
00:14:22,922 --> 00:14:25,671
Yellow hair, blue eyes,

227
00:14:25,672 --> 00:14:27,880
the tallest woman you've ever seen.

228
00:14:27,881 --> 00:14:29,339
Almost as tall as you.

229
00:14:31,505 --> 00:14:33,671
- Brienne of Tarth.
- You know her?

230
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:36,004
You're with Brienne of fucking Tarth?

231
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:38,379
Well, not with her yet.

232
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,004
- But I see the way she looks at me.
- How does she look at you?

233
00:14:42,005 --> 00:14:44,463
Like she wants to carve you
up and eat your liver?

234
00:14:44,464 --> 00:14:46,212
You do know her.

235
00:14:46,213 --> 00:14:47,671
We've met.

236
00:14:47,672 --> 00:14:49,796
I want to make babies with her.

237
00:14:49,797 --> 00:14:52,796
Think of them... great big monsters.

238
00:14:52,797 --> 00:14:54,379
They'd conquer the world.

239
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,962
How did a mad fucker
like you live this long?

240
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,714
I'm good at killing people.

241
00:15:02,631 --> 00:15:04,254
You don't look much like him.

242
00:15:04,255 --> 00:15:05,713
Who's that?

243
00:15:05,714 --> 00:15:07,755
Your father.

244
00:15:07,756 --> 00:15:09,838
I suppose you favor your mother.

245
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,212
You knew him?

246
00:15:12,213 --> 00:15:14,004
'Course I did.

247
00:15:14,005 --> 00:15:15,588
When he was Hand,

248
00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:17,962
he sent me off hunting for the Mountain.

249
00:15:17,963 --> 00:15:19,421
Your wildling friend told me

250
00:15:19,422 --> 00:15:21,713
the red woman brought you back.

251
00:15:21,714 --> 00:15:25,880
Thoros has brought me back six times.

252
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:28,962
We both serve the same lord.

253
00:15:28,963 --> 00:15:30,880
I serve the North.

254
00:15:30,881 --> 00:15:32,921
The North didn't raise
you from the dead.

255
00:15:32,922 --> 00:15:34,921
The Lord of Light never spoke to me.

256
00:15:34,922 --> 00:15:36,296
I don't know anything about him.

257
00:15:36,297 --> 00:15:37,921
I don't know what he wants from me.

258
00:15:37,922 --> 00:15:41,296
- He wants you alive.
- Why?

259
00:15:41,297 --> 00:15:43,713
I don't know.

260
00:15:43,714 --> 00:15:47,087
That's all anyone can
tell me... "I don't know."

261
00:15:47,088 --> 00:15:48,921
So, what's the point in serving a god

262
00:15:48,922 --> 00:15:51,421
if none of us knows what he wants?

263
00:15:51,422 --> 00:15:54,129
I think about that all the time.

264
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:57,212
I don't think it's our
purpose to understand.

265
00:15:57,213 --> 00:16:00,588
Except one thing... we're soldiers.

266
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:03,254
We have to know what we're fighting for.

267
00:16:03,255 --> 00:16:06,463
I'm not fighting so some
man or woman I barely know

268
00:16:06,464 --> 00:16:09,504
can sit on a throne made of swords.

269
00:16:09,505 --> 00:16:11,921
So, what are you fighting for?

270
00:16:11,922 --> 00:16:13,322
Life.

271
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:16,421
Death is the enemy.

272
00:16:16,422 --> 00:16:19,714
The first enemy and the last.

273
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:22,947
But we all die.

274
00:16:24,631 --> 00:16:26,962
The enemy always wins.

275
00:16:26,963 --> 00:16:29,212
And we still need to fight him.

276
00:16:29,213 --> 00:16:31,171
That's all I know.

277
00:16:31,172 --> 00:16:34,630
You and I won't find much
joy while we're here,

278
00:16:34,631 --> 00:16:36,880
but we can keep others alive.

279
00:16:36,881 --> 00:16:39,672
We can defend those who
can't defend themselves.

280
00:16:42,963 --> 00:16:45,880
"I am the shield that
guards the realms of men."

281
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:49,713
Maybe we don't need to
understand any more than that.

282
00:16:49,714 --> 00:16:51,921
Maybe that's enough.

283
00:16:51,922 --> 00:16:53,322
Aye.

284
00:16:54,881 --> 00:16:56,631
Maybe that's enough.

285
00:17:04,422 --> 00:17:07,005
That's what I saw in the fire.

286
00:17:08,172 --> 00:17:10,213
A mountain like an arrowhead.

287
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:13,547
THOROS: Are you sure?

288
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:18,005
We're getting close.

289
00:17:26,005 --> 00:17:28,005
DAENERYS: Do you know
what I like about you?

290
00:17:30,297 --> 00:17:33,504
- I honestly don't.
- You're not a hero.

291
00:17:33,505 --> 00:17:35,046
Oh.

292
00:17:35,047 --> 00:17:37,838
Well, I've been heroic on occasion.

293
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:40,630
I once charged through the Mud
Gate of King's Landing and...

294
00:17:40,631 --> 00:17:42,421
I don't want you to be a hero.

295
00:17:42,422 --> 00:17:45,713
Heroes do stupid things and they die.

296
00:17:45,714 --> 00:17:47,755
Drogo, Jorah, Daario,

297
00:17:47,756 --> 00:17:51,046
even this... Jon Snow...

298
00:17:51,047 --> 00:17:53,713
they all try to outdo each other.

299
00:17:53,714 --> 00:17:55,880
Who can do the stupidest, bravest thing.

300
00:17:55,881 --> 00:17:58,880
It's interesting, these heroes you name.

301
00:17:58,881 --> 00:18:01,087
Drogo, Jorah, Daario,

302
00:18:01,088 --> 00:18:04,004
even this... Jon Snow.

303
00:18:04,005 --> 00:18:06,129
They all fell in love with you.

304
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:09,087
- Jon Snow's not in love with me.
- Oh, my mistake.

305
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,796
I suppose he stares at you longingly

306
00:18:10,797 --> 00:18:13,714
because he's hopeful for a
successful military alliance.

307
00:18:17,213 --> 00:18:19,671
He's too little for me.

308
00:18:19,672 --> 00:18:21,504
I didn't mean...

309
00:18:21,505 --> 00:18:24,671
As heroes go, he is quite little.

310
00:18:24,672 --> 00:18:27,087
I know you're brave.

311
00:18:27,088 --> 00:18:29,047
I wouldn't have chosen
a coward as my Hand.

312
00:18:34,088 --> 00:18:36,962
So, if all goes well,

313
00:18:36,963 --> 00:18:39,255
I'll finally get to meet your sister.

314
00:18:40,797 --> 00:18:42,588
From everything you've
told me about her,

315
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:44,921
she'd rather murder me
than speak with me.

316
00:18:44,922 --> 00:18:48,755
Oh, first, she'd torture
you in some horrible way,

317
00:18:48,756 --> 00:18:50,156
then she'd murder you.

318
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:54,796
Nobody trusts my sister
less than I do, believe me.

319
00:18:54,797 --> 00:18:56,588
But if we go to the capital,

320
00:18:56,589 --> 00:18:59,421
we'll go with two armies,
we'll go with three dragons.

321
00:18:59,422 --> 00:19:03,171
Anyone touches you, King's Landing
burns down to the foundation stones.

322
00:19:03,172 --> 00:19:05,212
And right now, she's thinking
of how to set a trap.

323
00:19:05,213 --> 00:19:06,796
Of course she is.

324
00:19:06,797 --> 00:19:09,087
And she's wondering what
trap you're laying for her.

325
00:19:09,088 --> 00:19:10,546
Are we?

326
00:19:10,547 --> 00:19:12,714
Laying any traps?

327
00:19:14,714 --> 00:19:18,046
If we want to create a
new and better world,

328
00:19:18,047 --> 00:19:21,171
I'm not sure deceit and mass
murder is the best way to start.

329
00:19:21,172 --> 00:19:23,963
Which war was won without
deceit and mass murder?

330
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,755
Yes, you'll need to be ruthless

331
00:19:27,756 --> 00:19:29,630
if you're going to win the throne.

332
00:19:29,631 --> 00:19:31,671
You need to inspire a degree of fear.

333
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:34,046
But fear is all Cersei has.

334
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:36,880
It's all my father had, and Joffrey.

335
00:19:36,881 --> 00:19:38,796
It makes their power brittle

336
00:19:38,797 --> 00:19:42,588
because everyone beneath
them longs to see them dead.

337
00:19:42,589 --> 00:19:45,129
Aegon Targaryen got quite
a long way on fear.

338
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,796
He did.

339
00:19:46,797 --> 00:19:49,421
But you once spoke to me
of breaking the wheel.

340
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:50,880
Aegon built a wheel.

341
00:19:50,881 --> 00:19:53,087
If that's the kind of
queen you want to be,

342
00:19:53,088 --> 00:19:55,671
how are you different from all the
other tyrants that came before you?

343
00:19:55,672 --> 00:19:59,087
So we walk into the lions' den.

344
00:19:59,088 --> 00:20:00,755
My brother promised me he'd keep a grip

345
00:20:00,756 --> 00:20:02,379
on the Lannister forces.

346
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:06,254
Forgive me, but I don't care
about any Lannister promises.

347
00:20:06,255 --> 00:20:07,546
Except yours.

348
00:20:07,547 --> 00:20:09,671
And I promised him

349
00:20:09,672 --> 00:20:12,213
I'd keep you from doing
anything impulsive.

350
00:20:13,631 --> 00:20:15,031
Impulsive?

351
00:20:18,547 --> 00:20:21,254
This will be a difficult negotiation.

352
00:20:21,255 --> 00:20:24,796
We're sitting down with people who
want to see us both headless.

353
00:20:24,797 --> 00:20:27,296
My sister is likely to say
something provocative.

354
00:20:27,297 --> 00:20:29,838
- And?
- And you have been known

355
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:32,004
to lose your temper from time to time,

356
00:20:32,005 --> 00:20:33,338
as all great leaders do.

357
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:35,755
When have I lost my temper?

358
00:20:35,756 --> 00:20:38,296
Burning the Tarlys, for instance.

359
00:20:38,297 --> 00:20:39,838
That was not impulsive.

360
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:42,671
That was necessary.

361
00:20:42,672 --> 00:20:44,588
- Perhaps.
- Perhaps?

362
00:20:44,589 --> 00:20:48,171
Perhaps the father needed
to die and not the son.

363
00:20:48,172 --> 00:20:50,880
Perhaps they both needed time
to contemplate their mistakes

364
00:20:50,881 --> 00:20:53,171
in the solitude of a cold cell.

365
00:20:53,172 --> 00:20:55,588
We had no time to discuss
the possibilities

366
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,630
before you ended their possibilities.

367
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,338
One could be forgiven for
thinking you're taking

368
00:20:59,339 --> 00:21:01,171
your family's side in this debate.

369
00:21:01,172 --> 00:21:03,004
I am taking their side.

370
00:21:03,005 --> 00:21:04,713
You need to take your enemy's side

371
00:21:04,714 --> 00:21:06,713
if you're going to see
things the way they do.

372
00:21:06,714 --> 00:21:08,671
And you need to see
things the way they do

373
00:21:08,672 --> 00:21:10,713
if you're going to
anticipate their actions,

374
00:21:10,714 --> 00:21:14,046
respond effectively, and beat them.

375
00:21:14,047 --> 00:21:16,379
Which I want you to do very much.

376
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,880
Because I believe in you and in
the world you want to build.

377
00:21:19,881 --> 00:21:22,546
But the world you want to build

378
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:24,129
doesn't get built all at once.

379
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:27,254
Probably not in a single lifetime.

380
00:21:27,255 --> 00:21:30,087
How do we ensure that
your vision endures?

381
00:21:30,088 --> 00:21:33,047
After you break the wheel, how
do we make sure it stays broken?

382
00:21:35,589 --> 00:21:38,921
You want to know who sits on the
Iron Throne after I'm dead.

383
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,322
Is that it?

384
00:21:41,756 --> 00:21:43,671
You say you can't have children,

385
00:21:43,672 --> 00:21:46,962
but there are other ways
of choosing a successor.

386
00:21:46,963 --> 00:21:49,087
The Night's Watch has one method.

387
00:21:49,088 --> 00:21:51,463
The ironborn, for all their
many flaws, have another.

388
00:21:51,464 --> 00:21:54,171
We will discuss the succession
after I wear the crown.

389
00:21:54,172 --> 00:21:55,921
Your Grace, I saw hundreds of arrows

390
00:21:55,922 --> 00:21:58,254
fly towards you when you
fought on the Blackwater Rush,

391
00:21:58,255 --> 00:22:00,338
and I saw hundreds of arrows miss.

392
00:22:00,339 --> 00:22:02,962
But any one of them could have
found your heart and ended your...

393
00:22:02,963 --> 00:22:06,129
You've been thinking about my
death quite a bit, haven't you?

394
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,713
Is this one of the items you discussed

395
00:22:07,714 --> 00:22:09,421
with your brother in King's Landing?

396
00:22:09,422 --> 00:22:11,880
I'm trying to serve you by
planning for the long term.

397
00:22:11,881 --> 00:22:13,463
Perhaps if you planned
for the short term,

398
00:22:13,464 --> 00:22:15,505
we wouldn't have lost
Dorne and Highgarden.

399
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:22,797
We will discuss the succession
after I wear the crown.

You're worried.

We're asking 20,000 men

436
00:27:07,005 --> 00:27:10,755
to fight with us in the worst
winter any of them have ever seen.

Many of them will be happy to
find a good reason to go home.

- You question their loyalty?
- Their loyalty is to Jon.

440
00:27:20,047 --> 00:27:22,671
Jon is not here. I haven't
heard from him in weeks.

441
00:27:22,672 --> 00:27:24,713
You're the Lady of Winterfell.

442
00:27:24,714 --> 00:27:27,422
The king chose you to
rule in his absence.

443
00:27:29,255 --> 00:27:31,212
And rule you have.

444
00:27:31,213 --> 00:27:34,546
Wisely, ably.

445
00:27:34,547 --> 00:27:37,296
They see that. They respect you.

446
00:27:37,297 --> 00:27:38,713
Some may even prefer you.

447
00:27:38,714 --> 00:27:40,129
Yes, they turned their backs on Jon

448
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,546
when it was time to retake Winterfell,

449
00:27:41,547 --> 00:27:43,212
then they named him their king,

450
00:27:43,213 --> 00:27:45,087
and now they're ready to turn
their backs on him again.

451
00:27:45,088 --> 00:27:47,338
How far would you trust men like that?

452
00:27:47,339 --> 00:27:49,421
They're all bloody wind vanes.

453
00:27:49,422 --> 00:27:51,463
If they found out that
I wrote that letter,

454
00:27:51,464 --> 00:27:52,962
a woman who's already married

455
00:27:52,963 --> 00:27:56,504
not one, but two enemies of her house...

456
00:27:56,505 --> 00:27:59,546
By the time Jon comes back,
he'll have no army left.

457
00:27:59,547 --> 00:28:01,339
Arya's not like them.

458
00:28:03,756 --> 00:28:05,171
She's your sister.

459
00:28:05,172 --> 00:28:06,962
You may have disagreements,

460
00:28:06,963 --> 00:28:09,421
but she would never betray her family.

461
00:28:09,422 --> 00:28:11,962
She would if she thought I
was going to betray Jon.

462
00:28:11,963 --> 00:28:13,880
Is that what she thinks?

463
00:28:13,881 --> 00:28:15,796
I don't know what she thinks.

464
00:28:15,797 --> 00:28:17,839
I don't know her anymore.

465
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:22,672
Perhaps Lady Brienne could help.

466
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:29,129
She's sworn to protect both
of Catelyn Stark's girls,

467
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:30,530
is she not?

468
00:28:31,963 --> 00:28:33,380
She is.

469
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:41,713
And if one of you were planning
to harm the other in any way,

470
00:28:41,714 --> 00:28:43,839
wouldn't she be honor
bound to intercede?

471
00:28:46,881 --> 00:28:48,339
She would.

472
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:04,796
- Something I've always wanted to know.
- All right.

473
00:29:04,797 --> 00:29:09,046
How drunk were you when you charged
through the breach on Pyke?

474
00:29:09,047 --> 00:29:12,839
If I'm being honest, I don't remember
charging through the breach.

475
00:29:14,714 --> 00:29:18,379
Some of the lads told me
about it the next morning.

476
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,755
Sounded like a good scrap.

477
00:29:20,756 --> 00:29:23,046
Aye.

478
00:29:23,047 --> 00:29:25,338
It was a proper scrap.

479
00:29:25,339 --> 00:29:28,713
The ironborn thought you
were some kind of god,

480
00:29:28,714 --> 00:29:31,047
the way you were waving
that flaming sword.

481
00:29:32,422 --> 00:29:36,129
I thought you were the
bravest man I ever saw.

482
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:38,005

to sit next to a handsome,
young king on the Iron Throne.

I wanted to be a knight,

01:02:12,963 --> 01:02:16,047
to pick up a sword like
Father and go off to battle.
