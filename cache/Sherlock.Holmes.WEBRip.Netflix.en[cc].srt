and his seat and great authority.

319
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,765
I love what you've done with the place.

320
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,727
So glad you could accept my invitation.

321
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:41,939
I just have a small point of concern.

322
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:45,526
-How can I help?
-I'd followed the murders with interest.

323
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,529
While my heart went out
to the families of the victims...

324
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:52,658
...I couldn't but notice a criminal mastery
in the stroke of your brush.

325
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,244
-You're too kind.
-However, by comparison...

326
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:59,248
...your work in the crypt
was more akin to a finger painting.

327
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,963
So now you're curious
as to whether there's a larger game afoot.

328
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,799
Either that or, um...

329
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:12,845
...shortly my friend will pronounce you dead
and I thought I might keep him company.

330
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:16,432
Your mistake is to imagine that
anything earthly's led to this moment.

331
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:20,602
Your error of judgment is to assume
that I'm holding the brush at all.

332
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:24,314
-I'm merely the channel.
-My only wish is that I caught you sooner.

333
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:27,276
You see,
five lives might have been spared.

334
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:30,446
Mm. Those lives were a necessity.

335

Hm.

336

Five meaningless creatures
called to serve a greater purpose.

338

I wonder if they'd let Watson and me
dissect your brain.

339

340

that'd be scientifically significant.

341

Then you, too,
could serve a greater purpose.

342

Mr. Holmes, you must widen your gaze.

343

the gravity of coming events.

You and I are bound together
on a journey...

345
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,397
...that will twist the very fabric of nature.

346
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:10,027
But beneath your mask of logic,
I sense a fragility.

347
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,279
That worries me.

348
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:15,783
Steel your mind, Holmes.

350

You've come a long way down
from the House of Lords.

-And I will rise again.
-<i>Bon voyage.</i>

353

Three more will die, and there is
nothing you can do to save them.

354
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:30,339
You must accept
that this is beyond your control...

355
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:34,051
...or, by the time you realize you
made all of this possible...

356

...the unholy murder of five
innocent young women...

363

...and the attempted murder of a sixth.

364

Do you have any final words?

365
00:27:09,545 --> 00:27:11,171
Death...

366
00:27:12,214 --> 00:27:14,383
...is only the beginning.

367

PRIEST:
--forever and ever. Amen.

368

That is the end of Lord Blackwood.

369

ADLER:
London's so bleak this time of year.

370
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:20,449
Not that I'm pining for New Jersey.

371

I much prefer to travel in the winter.

372
00:28:25,454 --> 00:28:28,749
Here, I brought you these,
all the way from Syria.

373

I found these exquisite dates in Jordan...

374
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,962
...and your favorite...

375
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,506
...olives from the Cyclades.

376
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,926
Thought we might have a little tea party.

377
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:42,554
And while I was setting the table,
I found this:

378
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,806
A file with my name on it.

379
00:28:45,641 --> 00:28:47,976
"Theft of Velázquez portrait
from king of Spain."

"Missing naval documents lead
to resignation of Bulgarian prime minister."

"Scandalous affair ends engagement of...

But I don't see my name
in any of these articles.

Is that the maharajah's
missing diamond?

389

00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,935
-Right.
-It's nothing to do with me...

476
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:48,855
...but I advise you leave the case alone.

477
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:50,565
Well, I may not have a choice.

478
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:54,861
After all, I may be paying the rent
on my own soon, thanks to you.

479
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,906
-Get that out of my face.
-It's not. It's in my hand.

480
00:35:58,073 --> 00:35:59,407
Get what's in your hand out of my face.

481
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:00,867
CLARK: Mr. Holmes?
-Clarkie.

482
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:04,162
Sir, Inspector Lestrade asks
that you come with me at once.

483
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,998
What's he done now,
lost his way to Scotland Yard?

484
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,250
Watson, grab a compass.
"You" means "us."

485
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,919
No, "you" means you.

486
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:13,505
CLARK:
It's Lord Blackwood, sir. He, uh....

487
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:15,006
Well...

488
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:18,468
...it appears he's come back
from the grave, sir.

489
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:29,229
-Most engaging.
-Very clever.

490
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:31,272
I pronounced the man dead myself.

491
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:34,693
What are the facts?

492
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:38,113
Groundskeeper saw him walking
through the graveyard this morning.

493
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,990
I'll leave this in your capable hands.

494
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:45,745
-I have an appointment with Mary.
-It's not my reputation that's at stake here.

495
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,455
Don't try that.

496
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:50,875
-The newspapers got wind of it?
-That's what we're trying to avoid.

497
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,627
Certainly.

498
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:54,254
What's the major concern?

499
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:56,881
Panic. Sheer bloody panic, sir.

500
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,926
-Indeed.
-You're not taking this seriously, are you?

501
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:01,594
Yes, as you should.

502
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,640
It's a matter of professional integrity.

503
00:37:05,807 --> 00:37:09,769
No girl wants to marry a doctor
who can't tell if a man's dead or not.

504
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:28,121
Who do you think won the match,
Clarkie?

505
00:37:28,288 --> 00:37:30,707
-Sir?
-The rugby match.

506
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:35,003
Your boys have done a magnificent job
obliterating any potential evidence.

507
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:39,174
Yes. But at least they never miss
an opportunity to miss an opportunity.

508
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:44,179
LESTRADE:
You took your time, Holmes.

509
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:47,515
HOLMES:
"And on the third day"....

510
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,312
These slabs are half a ton each
if they're a pound...

511
00:37:52,479 --> 00:37:54,564
...and they're smashed open
from the inside.

512
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:57,358
Lestrade, what of the coffin?

513
00:37:57,525 --> 00:38:00,862
-We are in the process of bringing it up.
-I see.

514
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:06,117
Hm. Right. At what stage of the process?
Contemplative?

515
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,455
Anyhow, where's our witness?

516
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:11,915
He's over there.

517
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:14,250
And apparently, he is cata--

518
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,460
Cat--

519
00:38:15,627 --> 00:38:17,128
Catatonic, sir.

520
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:20,215
-He's not feeling very well.
-Yes.

521
00:38:22,342 --> 00:38:26,221
If you lot don't stop behaving like quivering
milkmaids, you're on double-time.

522
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:29,891
Now, you get down there
and you bring that coffin up now.

523
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:32,477
Good day, sir.

524
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,063
Hello.

525
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:37,816
It's all right.

526
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,692
I'm a doctor.

527
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:52,330
The man's in shock.
He may need a few moments.

528
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:57,168
The witness stated that he saw
Lord Blackwood rise from the grave.

529
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:58,795
Well?

530
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:02,090
-Well?
-You pronounced him dead.

531
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:04,759
He had no pulse.

532
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:11,099
MAN:
Ready.

533
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:13,434
Down.

534
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:26,948
Good Lord.

535
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,118
That's not Blackwood.

536
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:35,123
Well, now we have a firm grasp
of the obvious.

537
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:41,129
Time of death?

538
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:45,675
Diptera is...

539
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:48,344
...approximately...

540
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:52,098
...two thirds of an inch
which would put the time of death...

541
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:54,309
...at between 10 and 12 hours ago.

542
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:56,811
May I borrow your pen?

543
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,902
-Adler's dwarf.
-Midget.

544
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,121
GROUNDSKEEPER:
I know what I saw.

545
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,333
It was Blackwood.

546
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,961
As clear as I see you.

547
00:40:23,755 --> 00:40:26,424
And when the dead walk...

548
00:40:27,342 --> 00:40:30,178
...the living will fill these coffins.

549
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:34,641
Well, um....

550
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,684
[CLEARS THROAT]

551
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,813
LESTRADE: Right.
Put the lid on and clean this lot up.

552
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,024
WATSON:
You really believe he was resurrected?

553
00:40:43,191 --> 00:40:45,193
HOLMES:
The question is not if, but how.

554
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,362
-The game's afoot.
WATSON: Follow your spirit--

555
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,238
HOLMES & WATSON:
And upon this charge, cry:

556
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:52,784
"God for Harry, England and St. George."

557
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,579
There you are.

558
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,332
Why that certain fish and chips store?
I don't understand.

559
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:03,711
There's a particular beer in their batter.
A northern stout, to be exact.

560
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:07,674
WATSON: You know, Holmes,
I've seen things in war I don't understand.

561
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,134
I once met a man
who predicted his own death...

562
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,637
...right down to the number
and the placement...

563
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:15,056
...of the bullets that killed him.

564
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:16,808
You have to admit, Holmes...

565
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:19,602
...that a supernatural explanation
to this case...

566
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:21,896
...is theoretically possible.

567
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:27,068
Well, agreed, but it's a huge mistake
to theorize before one has data.

568
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:29,988
Inevitably one begins to twist facts
to suit theories...

569
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,365
...instead of theories to suit facts.

570
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:36,411
That said, I believe Adler's midget
is the key to this.

571
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:37,912
WATSON:
Hm.

572
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:41,249
HOLMES: Right. Scratches around
the keyhole where the watch was wound.

573
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:44,043
-What does that tell you?
-The man was likely a drunk.

574
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:47,588
Every time he wound the watch
his hand would slip, hence the scratches.

575
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:48,798
Very good, Watson.

576
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:52,677
You've developed considerable
deductive powers of your own. Hm.

577
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:55,596
Let's see now, there are several
sets of initials scored--

578
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,306
-Pawnbrokers' marks.
-Excellent.

579
00:41:57,473 --> 00:42:01,769
Most recent of which are "M.H."
M.H. M.H. is for?

580
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:04,480
-Maddison and Haig.
-Maddison and Haig.

581
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:10,611
They should be able to
give us an address.

582
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,325
What a coincidence.

583
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:19,954
There's one thing you've
failed to deduce from the watch.

584
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:21,539
HOLMES:
Really? I think not.

585
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:24,917
WATSON:
The time. I have to get back, Holmes.

586
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,961
Taking tea with the in-laws.

587
00:42:27,128 --> 00:42:29,422
-Reckon your future, sir?
-Absolutely not.

588
00:42:29,589 --> 00:42:32,133
WATSON: No, thank you.
-You need to hear what I have to tell.

589
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,635
We have no need of your lucky heather,
gypsy woman.

590
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:37,055
Even if it's to do with Mary?

591
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:43,478
Oh. Oh.

592
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:46,647
I see two men. Brothers.

593
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,649
Not in blood, but in bond.

594
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,030
What of Mary?

595
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:57,992
M for Mary, for marriage.
Oh, you will be married.

596
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,161
Go on.

597
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:03,539
I see patterned tablecloths...

598
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:06,167
...and, oh, china figurines...

599
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:08,294
...and, oh, lace doilies.

600
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,004
Doilies.

601
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:13,674
Lace doilies? Holmes.

602
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:17,136
Does your depravity know no bounds?

603
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:19,138
-No.
-Oh, she turns to fat...

604
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,140
...and, oh, she has a beard and....

605
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,476
-What of the warts?
-She's covered in warts.

606
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:25,269
-Enough.
-Are they extensive?

607
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,355
Please, enough.

608
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:31,692
It's the most apt prediction
Flora has made in years.

609
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:35,238
And precisely the reason
you can't find a suitable ring.

610
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:36,489
Do you have my money?

611
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:39,200
You are terrified of a life
without the thrill of the macabre.

612
00:43:39,367 --> 00:43:41,452
-Do you have my cut from the fight?
-Admit it.

613
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,704
-Give me my money! Holmes.
-Admit it!

614
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:47,416
HOLMES:
I see.

615
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:54,924
Thank you.

616
00:43:57,093 --> 00:44:00,721
HOLMES: Well, you've got your ring and
I've got my address for the ginger midget.

617
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:04,392
-Should be just there.
-I think she'll really like this.

618
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:08,312
And I have some change in my pocket.

619
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:15,236
-Shall I look after it for you?
-No, no.

620
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,989
-Don't give it away here.
-No.

621
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:20,158
I have to go see Mary.

622
00:44:20,408 --> 00:44:22,243
Give her my best.

623
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,163
And her family, as well.

624
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,288
It does make a considerable
difference to me...

625
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:10,041
...having someone with me
on whom I can thoroughly rely.

626
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:13,710
Well, you can rely on me
for exactly 10 minutes.

627
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:18,299
He clearly felt something
was coming to get him.

628
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:20,343
HOLMES:
Something did.

629
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:23,095
Irene Adler was here.

630

My initial approach was far too narrow.

1138
01:32:25,582 --> 01:32:28,043
When Blackwood invited me
to Pentonville Prison...

1139
01:32:28,209 --> 01:32:31,629
...he suggested I widen my gaze
and, at minimum, I have done just that.

In fact, I may well have reconciled
thousands of years of theological disparity.

But that's for another time.

Blackwood's method is based on
a ritualistic mystical system...

1143
01:32:43,975 --> 01:32:47,270
...that's been employed by the
Temple of the Four Orders for centuries.

I have emerged enlightened.

The fraternity who silently control
