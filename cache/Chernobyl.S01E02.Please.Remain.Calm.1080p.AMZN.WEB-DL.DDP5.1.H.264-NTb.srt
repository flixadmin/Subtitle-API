1
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:07,144
What is the cost of lies?

2
00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:11,206
Who is to blame?

3
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,454
It doesn't matter.

4
00:00:17,456 --> 00:00:18,915
It doesn't look right.

5
00:00:21,831 --> 00:00:22,956
We taste metal.

6
00:00:23,581 --> 00:00:25,748
I think there's graphite on the ground.

7
00:00:26,373 --> 00:00:27,848
You didn't see graphite.

8
00:00:27,851 --> 00:00:31,676
You didn't because it's not there!

9
00:00:33,748 --> 00:00:37,704
We seal off the city. Contain
the spread of misinformation.

10
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:51,788
Secretary Gorbachev has
appointed a committee

11
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:54,262
to manage the accident. You're on it.

12
00:02:39,373 --> 00:02:41,414
You work too hard.

13
00:02:42,706 --> 00:02:47,240
- Where is everyone?
- Oh, they refused to come in.

14
00:02:47,243 --> 00:02:49,744
- Why?
- It's Saturday.

15
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:55,454
- Why did you come in?
- I work too hard.

16
00:02:55,456 --> 00:02:57,247
It's boiling in here.

17
00:03:12,081 --> 00:03:14,380
Eight milliroentgen. A leak?

18
00:03:14,383 --> 00:03:15,633
No.

19
00:03:16,873 --> 00:03:19,454
It would've gone off before.
It's coming from outside.

20
00:03:19,456 --> 00:03:21,081
The Americans?

21
00:04:01,831 --> 00:04:04,412
Iodine 131.

22
00:04:04,414 --> 00:04:08,329
It's not military. It's
uranium decay, U-235.

23
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:09,831
Reactor fuel?

24
00:04:12,373 --> 00:04:16,079
Ignalina. Maybe, uh,
240 kilometers away.

25
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,663
Yes, this is Ulana Khomyuk

26
00:04:26,665 --> 00:04:29,245
with the Institute of Nuclear En...

27
00:04:29,247 --> 00:04:30,995
Looking for...?

28
00:04:35,286 --> 00:04:38,204
- All right, stay calm.
- Don't tell me to stay calm.

29
00:04:41,997 --> 00:04:44,871
They're at four. It's not them.

30
00:04:44,873 --> 00:04:47,799
- Who's the next closest?
- It's Chernobyl, but that's not possible.

31
00:04:47,802 --> 00:04:49,329
They're 400 kilometers away.

32
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,537
That's too far for eight milliroentgen.

33
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:53,245
They'd have to be split open.

34
00:04:53,247 --> 00:04:55,454
Maybe they know something.

35
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,746
- Iodine.
- Could it be a waste dump?

36
00:05:05,748 --> 00:05:07,204
No.

37
00:05:07,206 --> 00:05:09,663
We'd be seeing other isotopes.

38
00:05:09,665 --> 00:05:13,026
Nuclear test? Uh, new kind of bomb?

39
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:16,164
We'd have heard. That's what
half our people work on here.

40
00:05:17,623 --> 00:05:22,454
Something with the space
program like a satellite or...?

41
00:05:24,247 --> 00:05:26,373
No one's answering the phone.

42
00:05:46,498 --> 00:05:49,287
- Get everyone started on an IV.
- We don't have enough.

43
00:05:49,289 --> 00:05:51,371
- All the children then.
- But we don't have enough!

44
00:05:51,373 --> 00:05:52,871
As many as you can.

45
00:05:52,873 --> 00:05:57,162
- Where's the old man?
- He's set up a burn ward in 16.

46
00:06:10,247 --> 00:06:11,913
What are you doing? What is that?

47
00:06:11,915 --> 00:06:14,120
Milk. It's milk. Much better than water.

48
00:06:14,122 --> 00:06:15,704
No, no, no. Stop. Stop!

49
00:06:15,706 --> 00:06:18,287
- What are you doing?
- These are radiation burns!

50
00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:20,372
Their clothes are contaminated!

51
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:21,875
Help me!

52
00:06:23,206 --> 00:06:24,746
Get it all off.

53
00:06:25,915 --> 00:06:27,956
We're taking it down to the basement.

54
00:06:30,873 --> 00:06:32,579
He was a firefighter from Chernobyl.

55
00:06:32,581 --> 00:06:34,204
Can you stop pushing, please?

56
00:06:36,122 --> 00:06:39,663
We have our orders!

57
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:42,287
- Disperse!
- Hey, there! Get him!

58
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:46,788
Why you keeping us out here?

59
00:07:42,706 --> 00:07:44,537
Professor Legasov?

60
00:07:44,539 --> 00:07:46,029
Oh, no, not yet.

61
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,663
They're finishing up some other
business. It'll be a few more minutes.

62
00:07:48,665 --> 00:07:51,496
- Can I get you some tea?
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.

63
00:07:51,498 --> 00:07:54,471
Would you care to read Deputy Chairman
Shcherbina's report while you wait?

64
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,164
Certainly. Thank you.

65
00:08:55,665 --> 00:08:57,748
All right, Professor. They're ready.

66
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:00,790
Professor Legasov?

67
00:09:25,915 --> 00:09:27,904
You have my support.

68
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,565
Thank you all for your
duty to this commission.

69
00:09:36,568 --> 00:09:39,621
We will begin with Deputy
Chairman Shcherbina's briefing,

70
00:09:39,623 --> 00:09:43,329
and then we will discuss
next steps if necessary.

71
00:09:43,331 --> 00:09:45,287
Thank you, comrade General Secretary.

72
00:09:45,289 --> 00:09:49,496
I'm pleased to report that the
situation in Chernobyl is stable.

73
00:09:49,498 --> 00:09:52,857
Military and civilian patrols
have secured the region,

74
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,204
and Colonel General Pikalov,

75
00:09:55,206 --> 00:09:58,120
who commands troops
specializing in chemical hazards,

76
00:09:58,122 --> 00:10:00,245
has been dispatched to the plant.

77
00:10:00,247 --> 00:10:02,871
In terms of radiation,
plant director Bryukhanov

78
00:10:02,873 --> 00:10:06,287
reports no more than 3.6 roentgen.

79
00:10:06,289 --> 00:10:08,846
I'm told it's the
equivalent of a chest X-ray.

80
00:10:08,849 --> 00:10:11,829
So if you're overdue for a check-up...

81
00:10:11,831 --> 00:10:14,621
- And foreign press?
- Totally unaware.

82
00:10:14,623 --> 00:10:17,329
KGB First Deputy Chairman
Charkov assures me

83
00:10:17,331 --> 00:10:20,496
that we have successfully
protected our security interests.

84
00:10:20,498 --> 00:10:22,954
Good. Very good.

85
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,539
Well, it seems like
it's well in hand, so...

86
00:10:26,706 --> 00:10:29,581
if there's nothing
else, meeting adjourned.

87
00:10:30,539 --> 00:10:32,373
No!

88
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:36,245
Pardon me?

89
00:10:36,247 --> 00:10:38,663
Uh, we can't adjourn.

90
00:10:38,665 --> 00:10:41,393
This is Professor Legasov
of the Kurchatov Institute.

91
00:10:41,396 --> 00:10:43,079
Professor, if you have any concerns,

92
00:10:43,081 --> 00:10:45,162
feel free to address them with me later.

93
00:10:45,164 --> 00:10:49,079
I can't. I am sorry. I'm so sorry.

94
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:52,204
Page three, the section on casualties.

95
00:10:52,206 --> 00:10:53,412
Uh...

96
00:10:53,414 --> 00:10:56,329
"A fireman was severely
burned on his hand

97
00:10:56,331 --> 00:10:58,788
by a chunk of smooth, black mineral

98
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,330
on the ground, outside
the reactor building."

99
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:03,371
Smooth, black mineral... graphite.

100
00:11:03,373 --> 00:11:06,081
There's-There's graphite on the ground.

101
00:11:08,247 --> 00:11:11,412
Well, there was a... a tank
explosion. There's debris.

102
00:11:11,414 --> 00:11:14,371
- Of what importance...?
- There's only one place in the entire facility

103
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:17,663
where you will find
graphite: inside the core.

104
00:11:17,665 --> 00:11:19,412
If there's graphite
on the ground outside,

105
00:11:19,414 --> 00:11:21,799
it means it wasn't a control
system tank that exploded.

106
00:11:21,802 --> 00:11:24,206
- It was the reactor core.
- It's open!

107
00:11:27,414 --> 00:11:30,079
Um, Comrade Shcherbina?

108
00:11:30,081 --> 00:11:32,193
Comrade General
Secretary, I can assure you

109
00:11:32,196 --> 00:11:34,120
that Professor Legasov is mistaken.

110
00:11:34,122 --> 00:11:36,579
Bryukhanov reports that
the reactor core is intact.

111
00:11:36,581 --> 00:11:39,079
- And as for the radiation...
- Yes, 3.6 roentgen,

112
00:11:39,081 --> 00:11:41,829
which, by the way, is not the
equivalent of one chest X-ray,

113
00:11:41,831 --> 00:11:44,162
but rather 400 chest X-rays.

114
00:11:44,164 --> 00:11:46,862
That number's been bothering me
for a different reason, though.

115
00:11:46,865 --> 00:11:50,537
It's also the maximum reading
on low-limit dosimeters.

116
00:11:50,539 --> 00:11:53,371
They gave us the number they had.

117
00:11:53,373 --> 00:11:56,204
I think the true number
is much, much higher.

118
00:11:56,206 --> 00:11:58,995
If I'm right, this fireman
was holding the equivalent

119
00:11:58,997 --> 00:12:01,120
of four million chest
X-rays in his hand.

120
00:12:01,122 --> 00:12:03,579
Professor Legasov, there's no
place for alarmist hysteria...

121
00:12:03,581 --> 00:12:05,427
It's not alarmist if it's a fact!

122
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:08,995
Well, I don't hear any facts at all.

123
00:12:08,997 --> 00:12:11,621
All I hear is a man I don't know

124
00:12:11,623 --> 00:12:14,788
engaging in conjecture
in direct contradiction

125
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,995
to what has been reported
by party officials.

126
00:12:16,997 --> 00:12:20,454
I'm, uh... I apologize.

127
00:12:20,456 --> 00:12:22,954
I didn't mean, uh...

128
00:12:22,956 --> 00:12:26,663
Please, may I express my concern

129
00:12:26,665 --> 00:12:30,174
as calmly and as respectfully as I...

130
00:12:30,177 --> 00:12:32,832
- Professor Legasov...
- Boris.

131
00:12:33,873 --> 00:12:35,706
I will allow it.

132
00:12:44,537 --> 00:12:46,454
Um...

133
00:12:48,164 --> 00:12:51,037
An RBMK reactor

134
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:55,329
uses uranium 235 as fuel.

135
00:12:55,331 --> 00:13:00,204
Every atom of U-235 is like a bullet

136
00:13:00,206 --> 00:13:02,412
traveling at nearly the speed of light,

137
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,995
penetrating everything in its path:

138
00:13:04,997 --> 00:13:08,204
woods, metal, concrete, flesh.

139
00:13:08,206 --> 00:13:11,371
Every gram of U-235 holds

140
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:14,583
over a billion trillion
of these bullets.

141
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:15,979
That's in one gram.

142
00:13:15,982 --> 00:13:19,245
Now, Chernobyl holds
over three million grams,

143
00:13:19,247 --> 00:13:21,954
and right now, it is on fire.

144
00:13:21,956 --> 00:13:26,371
Winds will carry radioactive
particles across the entire continent,

145
00:13:26,373 --> 00:13:28,371
rain will bring them down on us.

146
00:13:28,381 --> 00:13:31,737
That's three million
billion trillion bullets

147
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:35,579
in the... in the air we breathe,

148
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:38,831
the water we drink, the food we eat.

149
00:13:40,498 --> 00:13:44,913
Most of these bullets will
not stop firing for 100 years.

150
00:13:44,915 --> 00:13:48,287
Some of them, not for 50,000 years.

151
00:13:48,289 --> 00:13:52,079
Yes, and, uh, this concern

152
00:13:52,081 --> 00:13:56,247
stems entirely from the
description of a rock?

153
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:01,915
Yes.

154
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:05,351
Hmm.

155
00:14:08,623 --> 00:14:10,414
Comrade Shcherbina...

156
00:14:11,456 --> 00:14:13,871
I want you to go to Chernobyl.

157
00:14:13,873 --> 00:14:16,079
You take a look at the
reactor, you personally,

158
00:14:16,081 --> 00:14:17,995
and you report directly back to me.

159
00:14:17,997 --> 00:14:20,287
A wise decision, comrade
General Secretary...

160
00:14:20,289 --> 00:14:22,873
And take Professor Legasov with you.

161
00:14:23,748 --> 00:14:25,162
Uh...

162
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:28,371
Forgive me, comrade
General Secretary, but I...

163
00:14:28,373 --> 00:14:30,748
Do you know how a nuclear reactor works?

164
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,245
- No.
- No.

165
00:14:34,247 --> 00:14:37,454
Well, then how will you
know what you're looking at?

166
00:14:37,456 --> 00:14:39,498
Meeting adjourned.

167
00:15:38,539 --> 00:15:40,204
How does a nuclear reactor work?

168
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:43,164
- What?
- It's a simple question.

169
00:15:44,498 --> 00:15:46,412
It's hardly a simple answer.

170
00:15:46,414 --> 00:15:50,412
Of course, you presume I'm
too stupid to understand.

171
00:15:50,414 --> 00:15:53,788
So I'll restate: Tell me
how a nuclear reactor works,

172
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:56,665
or I'll have one of these soldiers
throw you out of the helicopter.

173
00:16:06,789 --> 00:16:10,703
A nuclear reactor makes
electricity with steam.

174
00:16:10,706 --> 00:16:14,329
The steam turns a turbine
which generates electricity.

175
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:16,371
Where a typical power plant

176
00:16:16,373 --> 00:16:18,329
makes steam by burning coal,

177
00:16:18,331 --> 00:16:20,665
a nuclear plant...

178
00:16:25,831 --> 00:16:30,496
In a nuclear plant, we use
something called fission.

179
00:16:30,498 --> 00:16:36,537
We take an unstable
element like uranium 235,

180
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:38,682
which has too many neutrons.

181
00:16:38,685 --> 00:16:41,414
- A neutron is, uh...
- The bullet.

182
00:16:43,241 --> 00:16:45,033
Yes, the bullet.

183
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:48,954
So, bullets are flying
off of the uranium.

184
00:16:48,956 --> 00:16:50,371
Now...

185
00:16:50,373 --> 00:16:55,287
if we put enough uranium
atoms close together,

186
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:59,746
the bullets from one atom will
eventually strike another atom.

187
00:16:59,748 --> 00:17:02,913
The force of this impact
splits that atom apart,

188
00:17:02,915 --> 00:17:06,287
releasing a tremendous
amount of energy, fission.

189
00:17:06,289 --> 00:17:09,120
- And the graphite?
- Ah, yes.

190
00:17:09,122 --> 00:17:13,079
The neutrons are actually traveling
so fast... we call this "flux"...

191
00:17:13,081 --> 00:17:17,954
it's relatively unlikely that the
uranium atoms will ever hit one another.

192
00:17:17,956 --> 00:17:22,995
In RBMK reactors, we surround
the fuel rods with graphite

193
00:17:22,997 --> 00:17:27,997
to moderate, slow
down, the neutron flux.

194
00:17:31,221 --> 00:17:33,010
Good.

195
00:17:33,013 --> 00:17:36,055
I know how a nuclear reactor works.

196
00:17:37,729 --> 00:17:40,187
Now I don't need you.

197
00:17:58,665 --> 00:18:02,247
- Can you help me? I need to find my husband.
- No. Not now.

198
00:18:06,206 --> 00:18:07,788
- Mikhail!
- Lyudmilla.

199
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,454
Take her.

200
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:11,371
Take her away from here, please.

201
00:18:11,373 --> 00:18:14,079
- Get away from them! You want to get sick? Go!
- Oh my God.

202
00:18:14,081 --> 00:18:15,496
Please take her, please take her.

203
00:18:15,498 --> 00:18:17,329
Please take her, please.

204
00:18:17,331 --> 00:18:19,788
Please! Please!

205
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,498
Please take her!

206
00:18:26,831 --> 00:18:29,621
Excuse me, I am Vasily Ignatenko's wife.

207
00:18:29,623 --> 00:18:32,995
He's a fireman. Ignatenko.

208
00:18:32,997 --> 00:18:36,579
Ignatenko, Sixth Paramilitary
Fire and Rescue Unit.

209
00:18:36,581 --> 00:18:39,498
I need to find him. Please.

210
00:18:42,623 --> 00:18:44,287
Ignatenko...

211
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,871
He's being transported
by helicopter to Moscow.

212
00:18:46,873 --> 00:18:48,746
Hospital number six.

213
00:18:48,748 --> 00:18:50,954
Why, is he all right? Can I see him?

214
00:18:50,956 --> 00:18:52,537
You want to see him? Go to Moscow.

215
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:54,831
But they're not letting us leave here.

216
00:18:57,357 --> 00:18:59,649
Tell them Major Burov allows it.

217
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:04,206
- Oh. When are they taking him?
- Now.

218
00:19:35,012 --> 00:19:37,054
We're approaching the power plant.

219
00:19:42,922 --> 00:19:44,880
What have they done?

220
00:19:45,956 --> 00:19:47,677
Can you see inside?

221
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,994
I don't have to. Look.

222
00:19:50,997 --> 00:19:52,995
That's graphite on the roof.

223
00:19:52,997 --> 00:19:55,412
The whole building's been blown open.

224
00:19:55,414 --> 00:19:56,746
The core's exposed!

225
00:19:56,748 --> 00:19:58,746
I can't see how you
can tell that from here.

226
00:19:58,748 --> 00:19:59,990
Oh, for God's sakes.

227
00:19:59,993 --> 00:20:01,745
Look at that glow!

228
00:20:01,748 --> 00:20:04,349
That's radiation ionizing the air!

229
00:20:04,352 --> 00:20:06,204
Well, if we can't see, we don't know.

230
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:07,954
Get us directly over the building!

231
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,209
- Boris, if we fly...
- Don't you use my name!

232
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:11,994
...directly over an open reactor,
we'll be dead within a week!

233
00:20:11,997 --> 00:20:13,456
Dead!

234
00:20:14,414 --> 00:20:15,704
Sir?

235
00:20:15,706 --> 00:20:18,790
Get us over that building,
or I'll have you shot!

236
00:20:22,456 --> 00:20:24,579
If you fly directly over
that core, I promise you,

237
00:20:24,581 --> 00:20:27,331
by tomorrow morning, you'll
be begging for that bullet.

238
00:21:15,331 --> 00:21:17,539
Perhaps if you came back another day.

239
00:21:22,539 --> 00:21:24,995
Just wonderful.

240
00:21:24,997 --> 00:21:27,496
Deputy Secretary Garanin.

241
00:21:27,498 --> 00:21:31,746
Ulana Khomyuk of the Byelorussian
Institute for Nuclear Energy.

242
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:33,162
What a pleasure.

243
00:21:33,164 --> 00:21:36,039
- Let me introduce...
- I'm here about Chernobyl.

244
00:21:37,914 --> 00:21:39,412
Such a lovely time.

245
00:21:39,415 --> 00:21:42,873
- Visit again soon.
- I will. Thank you.

246
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,079
I must tell you, this is
why no one likes scientists.

247
00:21:58,081 --> 00:22:00,913
When we have a disease
to cure, where are they?

248
00:22:00,915 --> 00:22:04,474
In a lab, noses in their
books, and so Grandma dies.

249
00:22:04,477 --> 00:22:05,850
But when there isn't a problem,

250
00:22:05,853 --> 00:22:07,620
they're everywhere, spreading fear.

251
00:22:07,623 --> 00:22:10,079
- I know about Chernobyl.
- Oh?

252
00:22:10,081 --> 00:22:13,037
I know that the core is either
partially or completely exposed.

253
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,537
- Whatever that means.
- And that if you don't immediately

254
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:18,371
issue iodine tablets and
then evacuate this city,

255
00:22:18,373 --> 00:22:21,079
hundreds of thousands of
people are going to get cancer,

256
00:22:21,081 --> 00:22:23,279
and God knows how many more will die.

257
00:22:23,282 --> 00:22:25,056
Yes, very good.

258
00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:27,412
There has been an accident at Chernobyl,

259
00:22:27,414 --> 00:22:29,621
but I've been assured
there is no problem.

260
00:22:29,623 --> 00:22:31,621
I'm telling you that there is.

261
00:22:31,623 --> 00:22:33,663
I prefer my opinion to yours.

262
00:22:33,665 --> 00:22:37,037
I'm a nuclear physicist.

263
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,704
Before you were Deputy Secretary,

264
00:22:38,706 --> 00:22:40,373
you worked in a shoe factory.

265
00:22:41,498 --> 00:22:45,081
Yes, I worked in a shoe factory.

266
00:22:45,981 --> 00:22:48,106
And now I'm in charge.

267
00:22:50,414 --> 00:22:53,247
"To the workers of the world."

268
00:23:14,955 --> 00:23:17,578
Stable iodine will keep your thyroid

269
00:23:17,581 --> 00:23:19,956
from absorbing radioactive iodine.

270
00:23:21,122 --> 00:23:23,995
Take one a day for as long as they last.

271
00:23:23,997 --> 00:23:25,788
And go east.

272
00:23:25,790 --> 00:23:28,247
Get as far from Minsk as you can.

273
00:24:01,831 --> 00:24:03,579
It's overkill.

274
00:24:03,581 --> 00:24:05,579
Pikalov's showing off
to make us look bad.

275
00:24:05,581 --> 00:24:08,704
It doesn't matter how it looks.

276
00:24:08,706 --> 00:24:11,079
Shcherbina is a pure bureaucrat,

277
00:24:11,081 --> 00:24:13,162
as stupid as he is pigheaded.

278
00:24:13,164 --> 00:24:15,579
We'll tell him the truth in
the simplest terms possible.

279
00:24:15,581 --> 00:24:17,289
We'll be fine.

280
00:24:20,831 --> 00:24:22,373
Pikarov!

281
00:24:47,706 --> 00:24:50,663
Comrade Shcherbina,
Chief Engineer Fomin,

282
00:24:50,665 --> 00:24:52,704
Colonel General Pikalov, and I

283
00:24:52,706 --> 00:24:54,037
are honored at your arrival.

284
00:24:54,039 --> 00:24:55,371
Deeply, deeply honored.

285
00:24:55,373 --> 00:24:58,412
Naturally, we regret the
circumstances of your visit,

286
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:00,663
but, as you can see, we are
making excellent progress

287
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:02,287
in containing the damage.

288
00:25:02,289 --> 00:25:07,537
We have begun our own inquiry
into the cause of the accident,

289
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:10,621
and I have a list of individuals

290
00:25:10,623 --> 00:25:13,414
who we believe are accountable.

291
00:25:35,162 --> 00:25:37,299
Professor Legasov, I understand

292
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:39,454
you've been saying dangerous things.

293
00:25:39,456 --> 00:25:41,329
Very dangerous things.

294
00:25:41,331 --> 00:25:43,665
Apparently, our reactor core exploded.

295
00:25:44,331 --> 00:25:48,581
Please, tell me how an
RBMK reactor core explodes.

296
00:25:50,456 --> 00:25:52,871
I'm not prepared to
explain it at this time.

297
00:25:52,873 --> 00:25:55,829
As I presumed, he has no answer.

298
00:25:55,831 --> 00:25:58,412
It's disgraceful, really.

299
00:25:58,414 --> 00:26:01,915
To spread disinformation
at a time like this.

300
00:26:07,956 --> 00:26:10,746
Why did I see graphite on the roof?

301
00:26:10,748 --> 00:26:12,954
Graphite is only found in the core,

302
00:26:12,956 --> 00:26:16,496
where it's used as a
neutron flux moderator.

303
00:26:16,498 --> 00:26:17,915
Correct?

304
00:26:18,873 --> 00:26:22,331
Fomin, why did the Deputy
Chairman see graphite on the roof?

305
00:26:23,581 --> 00:26:25,373
Well, that... that can't be.

306
00:26:26,247 --> 00:26:28,995
Comrade Shcherbina, my
apologies, but graphite...

307
00:26:28,997 --> 00:26:30,287
that's not possible.

308
00:26:30,289 --> 00:26:32,474
Perhaps you saw burnt concrete.

309
00:26:32,477 --> 00:26:34,496
Now there you made a mistake,

310
00:26:34,498 --> 00:26:37,204
because I may not know
much about nuclear reactors,

311
00:26:37,206 --> 00:26:38,831
but I know a lot about concrete.

312
00:26:39,665 --> 00:26:42,164
- Comrade, I assure you...
- I understand.

313
00:26:42,997 --> 00:26:45,704
You think Legasov is wrong.

314
00:26:45,706 --> 00:26:47,665
How shall we prove it?

315
00:26:48,956 --> 00:26:52,287
Our high-range dosimeter just arrived.

316
00:26:52,289 --> 00:26:55,329
We could cover one of our
trucks with lead shielding,

317
00:26:55,331 --> 00:26:57,665
mount the dosimeter on the front.

318
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:06,746
Have one of your men get as
close to the fire as he can.

319
00:27:06,748 --> 00:27:08,496
Give him every bit of
protection you have.

320
00:27:08,498 --> 00:27:10,871
But understand that
even with lead shielding,

321
00:27:10,873 --> 00:27:12,873
it may not be enough.

322
00:27:14,706 --> 00:27:16,581
Then I'll do it myself.

323
00:27:21,247 --> 00:27:23,206
Good.

324
00:29:20,903 --> 00:29:22,737
He's back.

325
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:54,037
It's not three roentgen.

326
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:55,871
It's 15,000.

327
00:29:55,873 --> 00:29:58,621
Comrade Shcherbina...

328
00:29:58,623 --> 00:30:00,162
What does that number mean?

329
00:30:00,164 --> 00:30:02,412
It means the core is open.

330
00:30:02,414 --> 00:30:04,954
It means the fire we're
watching with our own eyes

331
00:30:04,956 --> 00:30:06,537
is giving off nearly twice the radiation

332
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:08,454
released by the bomb in Hiroshima.

333
00:30:08,456 --> 00:30:10,329
And that's every single hour.

334
00:30:10,331 --> 00:30:13,365
Hour after hour, 20
hours since the explosion,

335
00:30:13,368 --> 00:30:15,233
so 40 bombs worth by now.

336
00:30:15,236 --> 00:30:16,651
Forty-eight more tomorrow.

337
00:30:16,654 --> 00:30:19,371
And it will not stop. Not
in a week, not in a month.

338
00:30:19,373 --> 00:30:20,954
It will burn and spread its poison

339
00:30:20,956 --> 00:30:23,665
until the entire continent is dead.

340
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:29,120
Please escort Comrades
Bryukhanov and Fomin

341
00:30:29,122 --> 00:30:31,177
to the local party headquarters.

342
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,162
- Thank you for your service.
- Comrade...

343
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,539
You're excused.

344
00:30:35,448 --> 00:30:37,240
Dyatlov was in charge.

345
00:30:38,247 --> 00:30:40,204
It was Dyatlov!

346
00:30:40,206 --> 00:30:42,913
- Tell me how to put it out.
- We'll use helicopters.

347
00:30:42,915 --> 00:30:45,910
- We'll drop water on it like a forest fire.
- No, no. You don't understand.

348
00:30:45,912 --> 00:30:48,120
This isn't a fire.

349
00:30:48,122 --> 00:30:50,229
This is a fissioning reactor core

350
00:30:50,232 --> 00:30:52,412
burning at over 2,000 degrees.

351
00:30:52,414 --> 00:30:54,079
The heat will instantly
vaporize the water...

352
00:30:54,081 --> 00:30:57,247
How do we put it out?

353
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:00,496
You are dealing with something

354
00:31:00,498 --> 00:31:04,956
that has never occurred
on this planet before.

355
00:31:06,915 --> 00:31:08,456
Boron.

356
00:31:09,831 --> 00:31:11,913
Boron and sand.

357
00:31:11,915 --> 00:31:14,621
Well, that'll create
problems of its own,

358
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:16,788
but I-I don't see any other way.

359
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,954
Of course, it's going to
take thousands of drops,

360
00:31:18,956 --> 00:31:21,621
because you can't fly the
helicopters directly over the core,

361
00:31:21,623 --> 00:31:23,079
so most of it is going to miss.

362
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:25,484
- How much sand and boron?
- Well, I can't be...

363
00:31:25,487 --> 00:31:29,287
- For God's sake, roughly!
- Five thousand tons.

364
00:31:29,289 --> 00:31:32,245
And obviously, we're going to need
to evacuate an enormous area...

365
00:31:32,247 --> 00:31:34,245
Never mind that. Focus on the fire.

366
00:31:34,247 --> 00:31:37,079
I am focusing on the fire.

367
00:31:37,081 --> 00:31:41,287
The wind, it's carrying all that smoke,

368
00:31:41,289 --> 00:31:43,120
all that radiation.

369
00:31:43,122 --> 00:31:46,204
At least evacuate Pripyat.
It's three kilometers away.

370
00:31:46,206 --> 00:31:48,204
- That's my decision to make.
- Then make it.

371
00:31:48,206 --> 00:31:50,954
- I've been told not to.
- Is it or is not...

372
00:31:50,956 --> 00:31:52,829
I'm in charge here!

373
00:31:52,831 --> 00:31:54,579
This will go much
easier if you talk to me

374
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:55,913
about the things you do understand

375
00:31:55,915 --> 00:31:58,665
and not about the things
you do not understand.

376
00:32:02,414 --> 00:32:03,995
Where are you going?

377
00:32:03,997 --> 00:32:07,831
I'm going to get you 5,000
tons of sand and boron.

378
00:32:15,706 --> 00:32:17,831
There's a hotel.

379
00:33:13,623 --> 00:33:15,706
I'd prefer one of those.

380
00:33:23,748 --> 00:33:25,581
Superstitious?

381
00:33:34,414 --> 00:33:36,247
Moscow?

382
00:33:39,706 --> 00:33:42,081
Are you here because of the fire?

383
00:33:46,373 --> 00:33:48,915
Anything we should be worried about?

384
00:33:54,373 --> 00:33:55,956
No.

385
00:34:06,456 --> 00:34:07,956
Ah.

386
00:35:00,373 --> 00:35:03,039
We're in position. Approaching drop.

387
00:35:04,164 --> 00:35:06,289
Clear to proceed.

388
00:35:07,665 --> 00:35:10,873
Copy. We'll go one by one in rotation.

389
00:35:16,039 --> 00:35:18,164
Remind them about the perimeter.

390
00:35:21,665 --> 00:35:23,913
They cannot fly directly over the fire.

391
00:35:23,915 --> 00:35:26,204
A minimum of a ten-meter perimeter.

392
00:35:26,206 --> 00:35:27,704
Ten meter perimeter. Copy.

393
00:35:27,706 --> 00:35:29,329
Lead One, per pre-flight:

394
00:35:29,331 --> 00:35:32,120
maintain minimum ten-meter perimeter.

395
00:35:32,122 --> 00:35:33,287
Copy that.

396
00:35:33,289 --> 00:35:36,037
Forty meters... 35...

397
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:37,371
30...

398
00:35:40,915 --> 00:35:43,204
No, no, no! They're too close!

399
00:35:43,206 --> 00:35:45,237
They can't get over the
fire. How are they supposed...

400
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:47,037
The wind will have to carry it.

401
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:49,915
Tell them, they cannot go over the core.

402
00:35:52,331 --> 00:35:53,663
Lead One is too close.

403
00:35:53,665 --> 00:35:55,539
I repeat, they are too close.

404
00:35:56,206 --> 00:35:58,120
Copy.

405
00:35:58,122 --> 00:36:01,037
Lead One, you are inside the perimeter.

406
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:04,245
Did not copy. Signal's breaking up.

407
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:09,162
Lead One?

408
00:36:09,164 --> 00:36:10,829
Do you copy?

409
00:36:10,831 --> 00:36:12,829
Lead One, do you copy?

410
00:36:12,831 --> 00:36:15,037
Lead One, come in.

411
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,913
Do you copy, Lead One?

412
00:36:16,915 --> 00:36:18,623
Lead One!

413
00:36:36,456 --> 00:36:39,122
Sir? What do I tell the others?

414
00:36:41,456 --> 00:36:43,412
Is there any other way, Legasov?

415
00:36:51,956 --> 00:36:53,831
Send the next one in.

416
00:36:55,247 --> 00:36:57,289
Tell them to approach from the west.

417
00:36:58,373 --> 00:37:01,498
Lead Two, approach from the west.

418
00:37:22,289 --> 00:37:24,995
Kurchatov Institute Laboratory Four.

419
00:37:24,997 --> 00:37:29,456
Marina Gruzinskaya, it's
Ulana Khomyuk from Minsk.

420
00:37:31,665 --> 00:37:34,329
Oh, yes, how nice of you to phone.

421
00:37:34,331 --> 00:37:36,329
- It's been too long.
- It has.

422
00:37:36,331 --> 00:37:38,995
I was actually calling about our friend.

423
00:37:38,997 --> 00:37:41,329
- You know, the one in the country.
- Oh, yes, of course.

424
00:37:41,331 --> 00:37:45,162
I wanted to see how he's doing.
It's so hot there right now.

425
00:37:45,164 --> 00:37:47,663
Yes, it's extremely hot,

426
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:49,079
but his nephews are flying down,

427
00:37:49,081 --> 00:37:51,162
and they always bring cool weather.

428
00:37:51,164 --> 00:37:52,790
Oh? Which nephews?

429
00:37:53,539 --> 00:37:57,663
Simka, who's 14, and
little Boris, who's five.

430
00:37:57,665 --> 00:37:58,954
Well, that's wonderful.

431
00:37:58,956 --> 00:38:00,829
Though children can make you even hotter

432
00:38:00,831 --> 00:38:02,663
when they're crawling all over you.

433
00:38:02,665 --> 00:38:04,162
Maybe I should visit them.

434
00:38:04,164 --> 00:38:06,037
No, they don't want visitors.

435
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:08,412
I'm sorry, um, I have
to get back to work.

436
00:38:08,414 --> 00:38:10,831
It's very busy right now. Goodbye.

437
00:38:13,665 --> 00:38:16,206
They're dropping sand
and boron on the fire.

438
00:38:17,206 --> 00:38:18,748
It's what I would do.

439
00:38:20,539 --> 00:38:22,247
Yes, I'm sure it is.

440
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:46,206
Where are you going?

441
00:38:47,247 --> 00:38:48,706
Chernobyl.

442
00:38:56,247 --> 00:38:59,120
It's been smooth. Twenty drops.

443
00:39:05,081 --> 00:39:06,539
What?

444
00:39:09,373 --> 00:39:12,496
There are 50,000 people in this city.

445
00:39:12,498 --> 00:39:17,204
Professor Ilyin, who's
also on the commission,

446
00:39:17,206 --> 00:39:20,162
says the radiation isn't
high enough to evacuate.

447
00:39:20,164 --> 00:39:21,913
Ilyin isn't a physicist.

448
00:39:21,915 --> 00:39:24,995
Well, he's a medical doctor.
If he says it's safe, it's safe.

449
00:39:24,997 --> 00:39:27,537
- Not if they stay here.
- We're staying here.

450
00:39:27,539 --> 00:39:32,037
Yes, we are, and we'll
be dead in five years.

451
00:39:39,915 --> 00:39:42,454
I'm sorry, I...

452
00:39:42,456 --> 00:39:43,997
I'm sorry.

453
00:40:22,299 --> 00:40:23,706
Shcherbina.

454
00:40:35,164 --> 00:40:36,498
Thank you.

455
00:40:42,664 --> 00:40:46,620
A nuclear plant in Sweden
has detected radiation

456
00:40:46,623 --> 00:40:49,706
and identified it as a
byproduct of our fuel.

457
00:40:50,831 --> 00:40:53,498
The Americans took satellite photos.

458
00:40:54,456 --> 00:40:57,829
The reactor building,
the smoke, the fire.

459
00:41:00,456 --> 00:41:02,373
The whole world knows.

460
00:41:08,956 --> 00:41:11,539
The wind has been
blowing toward Germany.

461
00:41:12,956 --> 00:41:15,539
They're not letting
children play outside...

462
00:41:17,414 --> 00:41:18,997
in Frankfurt.

463
00:41:30,623 --> 00:41:32,498
Want a smoke?

464
00:41:47,693 --> 00:41:50,579
There has been a nuclear
accident in the Soviet Union

465
00:41:50,581 --> 00:41:52,412
and the Soviets have
admitted that it happened.

466
00:41:52,414 --> 00:41:54,037
The Soviet version is this:

467
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:55,537
One of the atomic reactors

468
00:41:55,539 --> 00:41:58,204
at the Chernobyl Atomic Power
Plant near the city of Kiev

469
00:41:58,206 --> 00:42:00,871
was damaged, and there
is speculation in Moscow

470
00:42:00,873 --> 00:42:03,162
that people were injured
and may have died.

471
00:42:03,164 --> 00:42:06,371
The Soviets may have been fairly
quick to acknowledge the accident

472
00:42:06,373 --> 00:42:09,746
because evidence in the form
of mild nuclear radiation

473
00:42:09,748 --> 00:42:13,790
had already reached beyond the
Soviet borders to Scandinavia.

474
00:46:28,414 --> 00:46:30,913
I said turn around. This
is a restricted zone.

475
00:46:30,915 --> 00:46:33,713
I'm from the Byelorussian
Institute for Nuclear Energy.

476
00:46:33,716 --> 00:46:35,371
Do you have permission?

477
00:46:35,373 --> 00:46:37,704
Listen to me, I need to
speak to someone urgently.

478
00:46:37,706 --> 00:46:40,162
Turn around right now,
or I'll arrest you.

479
00:46:40,164 --> 00:46:41,995
If you arrest me, you should take me

480
00:46:41,997 --> 00:46:44,206
to the highest possible authority.

481
00:46:48,706 --> 00:46:51,329
We have to start a radiological survey.

482
00:46:51,331 --> 00:46:55,539
Sector by sector, on
foot, dosimeters in hand.

483
00:46:57,164 --> 00:46:58,915
Are you all right?

484
00:47:01,539 --> 00:47:02,873
Of course.

485
00:47:04,081 --> 00:47:05,496
Comrades...

486
00:47:05,498 --> 00:47:08,204
The guards arrested this
woman at the south checkpoint.

487
00:47:08,206 --> 00:47:12,537
- I'd have put her in a cell...
- But he thought you should know that I know.

488
00:47:12,539 --> 00:47:14,617
I know that your
reactor core is exposed.

489
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:17,412
I know the graphite is on
fire, the fuel is melting,

490
00:47:17,414 --> 00:47:19,412
and you're dropping
sand and boron on it,

491
00:47:19,414 --> 00:47:22,746
which you probably thought was
smart, but you've made a mistake.

492
00:47:22,748 --> 00:47:25,913
Ulana Yuriyvna Khomyuk, Chief Physicist,

493
00:47:25,915 --> 00:47:28,287
Byelorussian Institute
for Nuclear Energy.

494
00:47:28,289 --> 00:47:31,621
And you are Valery Alexeyevich Legasov?

495
00:47:31,623 --> 00:47:34,245
Smothering the core
will put the fire out,

496
00:47:34,247 --> 00:47:37,120
but the temperature will
eventually increase...

497
00:47:37,122 --> 00:47:38,746
Believe me, I'm perfectly aware.

498
00:47:38,748 --> 00:47:40,871
But I estimate at least a month

499
00:47:40,873 --> 00:47:42,871
before it melts through
the lower concrete pad,

500
00:47:42,873 --> 00:47:44,871
- which gives us time...
- No, you don't have a month.

501
00:47:44,873 --> 00:47:46,581
You have approximately two days.

502
00:47:47,498 --> 00:47:50,788
Yes, the fuel would take a month

503
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:52,913
to reach the concrete pad here.

504
00:47:52,915 --> 00:47:56,496
But first... it's going to burn through

505
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:58,954
the biological shield here by Tuesday.

506
00:47:58,956 --> 00:48:02,037
And when it does, it's
going to hit these tanks...

507
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:03,412
bubbler pools, reservoirs...

508
00:48:03,414 --> 00:48:06,663
Reservoirs for the ECS.
I understand your concern,

509
00:48:06,665 --> 00:48:08,663
but I confirmed it with plant personnel.

510
00:48:08,665 --> 00:48:12,329
- The tanks are nearly empty.
- No, they were nearly empty.

511
00:48:12,331 --> 00:48:15,871
Each of these points
here, here, and here

512
00:48:15,873 --> 00:48:17,954
all drain to the bubbler pools.

513
00:48:17,956 --> 00:48:20,579
I'm guessing that every pipe
in the building ruptured.

514
00:48:20,581 --> 00:48:23,621
And then there are those fire
engines that I saw on the way in.

515
00:48:23,623 --> 00:48:25,829
The fire hoses are still connected.

516
00:48:25,831 --> 00:48:28,954
They've been gushing water into
the structure this whole time.

517
00:48:28,956 --> 00:48:30,915
The tanks are full.

518
00:48:32,915 --> 00:48:35,456
The tanks are full.

519
00:49:14,456 --> 00:49:18,829
I have ten minutes, then
I'm back on the phone

520
00:49:18,831 --> 00:49:21,829
apologizing to our friends,

521
00:49:21,831 --> 00:49:25,079
apologizing to our enemies.

522
00:49:25,081 --> 00:49:28,496
Our power comes from the
perception of our power.

523
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:32,204
Do you understand the
damage this has done?

524
00:49:32,206 --> 00:49:35,414
Do you understand what's at stake?

525
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:38,373
Boris.

526
00:49:40,456 --> 00:49:44,873
Professor Legasov will
deliver our briefing.

527
00:49:46,539 --> 00:49:48,120
There is some good news.

528
00:49:48,122 --> 00:49:50,871
The air drops are
working to douse the fire.

529
00:49:50,873 --> 00:49:54,704
There's been a reduction
in radionuclide emissions,

530
00:49:54,706 --> 00:49:56,621
but the fire will not be extinguished

531
00:49:56,623 --> 00:49:59,498
for at least another two weeks.

532
00:50:01,414 --> 00:50:04,414
There is also an additional problem.

533
00:50:05,956 --> 00:50:07,788
Nuclear fuel doesn't turn cold

534
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:10,537
simply because it is not on fire.

535
00:50:10,539 --> 00:50:12,245
In fact, the temperature
will likely rise

536
00:50:12,247 --> 00:50:15,037
as a result of the blanket
of sand we've dropped.

537
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:17,913
The uranium will melt the sand,

538
00:50:17,915 --> 00:50:19,704
creating a kind of lava

539
00:50:19,706 --> 00:50:23,079
which will begin to melt
down through the shield below.

540
00:50:23,081 --> 00:50:24,623
You have made lava?

541
00:50:27,289 --> 00:50:29,414
I anticipated this.

542
00:50:30,915 --> 00:50:33,287
I believed there was time to reinforce

543
00:50:33,289 --> 00:50:35,412
this lower concrete pad

544
00:50:35,414 --> 00:50:36,954
before the lava reached the earth

545
00:50:36,956 --> 00:50:38,579
and contaminated the groundwater.

546
00:50:38,581 --> 00:50:41,746
But as it turned out, I was
worried about the wrong thing.

547
00:50:41,748 --> 00:50:43,704
Uh, um...

548
00:50:43,706 --> 00:50:47,371
It was my understanding
that these large water tanks

549
00:50:47,373 --> 00:50:50,037
under the reactor
were essentially empty.

550
00:50:50,039 --> 00:50:53,204
This is Ulana Khomyuk of
the Byelorussian Institute.

551
00:50:53,206 --> 00:50:55,579
Thanks to her insight, we are now aware

552
00:50:55,581 --> 00:50:58,954
that the tanks are, in fact, full.

553
00:50:58,956 --> 00:51:02,831
Of water. Why is that
a problem, professor?

554
00:51:07,122 --> 00:51:08,871
When the lava enters these tanks,

555
00:51:08,873 --> 00:51:11,601
it will instantly superheat and vaporize

556
00:51:11,604 --> 00:51:15,037
approximately 7,000
cubic meters of water,

557
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:18,621
causing a significant thermal explosion.

558
00:51:18,623 --> 00:51:20,663
How significant?

559
00:51:20,665 --> 00:51:24,621
We estimate between
two and four megatons.

560
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:27,995
Everything within a 30-kilometer radius

561
00:51:27,997 --> 00:51:29,746
will be completely destroyed,

562
00:51:29,748 --> 00:51:33,162
including the three remaining
reactors at Chernobyl.

563
00:51:33,164 --> 00:51:36,746
The entirety of the radioactive
material in all of the cores

564
00:51:36,748 --> 00:51:39,913
will be ejected at force

565
00:51:39,915 --> 00:51:43,037
and dispersed by a massive shock wave,

566
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:48,329
which will extend
approximately 200 kilometers

567
00:51:48,331 --> 00:51:51,704
and likely be fatal to the
entire population of Kiev

568
00:51:51,706 --> 00:51:53,829
as well as a portion of Minsk.

569
00:51:53,831 --> 00:51:56,829
The release of radiation will be severe

570
00:51:56,831 --> 00:52:00,162
and will impact all of Soviet Ukraine,

571
00:52:00,164 --> 00:52:03,871
Latvia, Lithuania, Byelorussia,

572
00:52:03,873 --> 00:52:07,204
as well as Poland,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary,

573
00:52:07,206 --> 00:52:09,873
Romania, and most of East Germany.

574
00:52:13,539 --> 00:52:16,414
What do you mean "impact"?

575
00:52:17,206 --> 00:52:19,829
For much of the area, a
nearly permanent disruption

576
00:52:19,831 --> 00:52:22,454
of the food and water supply,

577
00:52:22,456 --> 00:52:25,537
a steep increase in the rates
of cancer and birth defects.

578
00:52:25,539 --> 00:52:29,079
I don't know how many deaths
there will be, but many.

579
00:52:29,081 --> 00:52:31,037
For Byelorussia and the Ukraine,

580
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:33,454
"impact" means completely uninhabitable

581
00:52:33,456 --> 00:52:36,873
for a minimum of 100 years.

582
00:52:40,706 --> 00:52:44,204
There are more than 50 million people

583
00:52:44,206 --> 00:52:47,037
living in Byelorussia and Ukraine.

584
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:48,873
Sixty, yes.

585
00:52:53,247 --> 00:52:55,079
And how long before this happens?

586
00:52:55,081 --> 00:52:58,956
Approximately 48 to 72 hours.

587
00:53:02,414 --> 00:53:04,913
But we may have a solution.

588
00:53:04,915 --> 00:53:06,788
We can pump the water from the tanks.

589
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:10,287
Unfortunately, the tanks are
sealed shut by a sluice gate,

590
00:53:10,289 --> 00:53:12,496
and the gate can only be opened manually

591
00:53:12,498 --> 00:53:14,120
from within the duct system itself.

592
00:53:14,122 --> 00:53:17,371
So we need to find three plant workers

593
00:53:17,373 --> 00:53:19,037
who know the facility well enough

594
00:53:19,039 --> 00:53:20,746
to enter the basement here,

595
00:53:20,748 --> 00:53:25,079
find their way through
all these duct ways,

596
00:53:25,081 --> 00:53:27,245
get to the sluice gate valve here,

597
00:53:27,247 --> 00:53:31,788
and give us the access we
need to pump out the tanks.

598
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:34,621
Of course, we will need your permission.

599
00:53:34,623 --> 00:53:36,746
My permission for what?

600
00:53:36,748 --> 00:53:39,287
Uh, the water in these ducts,

601
00:53:39,289 --> 00:53:42,204
the level of radioactive
contamination...

602
00:53:42,206 --> 00:53:44,623
They'll likely be dead in a week.

603
00:53:46,373 --> 00:53:50,122
We're asking for your
permission to kill three men.

604
00:53:58,289 --> 00:53:59,746
Well...

605
00:53:59,748 --> 00:54:02,412
Comrade Legasov...

606
00:54:02,414 --> 00:54:06,164
all victories inevitably come at a cost.

607
00:55:31,289 --> 00:55:35,204
And open the sluice gate valve... here.

608
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:37,287
The valve will be difficult to operate,

609
00:55:37,289 --> 00:55:39,204
so we'll need three men

610
00:55:39,206 --> 00:55:42,829
who will need to know
the basement layout.

611
00:55:42,831 --> 00:55:46,871
And, of course, any
volunteers will be rewarded.

612
00:55:46,873 --> 00:55:51,289
A yearly stipend of 400 rubles.

613
00:55:57,373 --> 00:56:02,412
And, uh, for those of you working
in reactors one and two, promotions.

614
00:56:02,414 --> 00:56:06,245
Why are reactors one and
two still operating at all?

615
00:56:06,247 --> 00:56:08,412
My friend was a security
guard that night,

616
00:56:08,414 --> 00:56:10,079
and, uh, she's now dying.

617
00:56:10,081 --> 00:56:12,788
And we've all heard about the firemen.

618
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:16,790
And now you want us to swim
underneath a burning reactor?

619
00:56:17,581 --> 00:56:19,788
Do you even know how contaminated it is?

620
00:56:21,790 --> 00:56:23,746
I... I don't have an exact number.

621
00:56:23,748 --> 00:56:26,623
You don't need an exact number
to know if it'll kill us.

622
00:56:26,626 --> 00:56:28,543
But you can't even tell us that.

623
00:56:30,456 --> 00:56:32,954
Why should we do this?
For what, 400 rubles?

624
00:56:36,414 --> 00:56:39,164
You'll do it because it must be done.

625
00:56:43,748 --> 00:56:47,122
You'll do it because nobody else can.

626
00:56:49,456 --> 00:56:53,122
And if you don't, millions will die.

627
00:56:54,289 --> 00:56:57,247
If you tell me that's not
enough, I won't believe you.

628
00:56:58,456 --> 00:57:02,621
This is what has always
set our people apart.

629
00:57:02,623 --> 00:57:05,831
A thousand years of
sacrifice in our veins.

630
00:57:06,665 --> 00:57:09,456
And every generation must
know its own suffering.

631
00:57:10,498 --> 00:57:13,329
I spit on the people who did this,

632
00:57:13,331 --> 00:57:15,956
and I curse the price I have to pay.

633
00:57:18,081 --> 00:57:20,579
But I'm making my peace with it,

634
00:57:20,581 --> 00:57:22,412
and now you make yours.

635
00:57:22,414 --> 00:57:25,164
And go into that water.

636
00:57:27,247 --> 00:57:28,995
Because it must be done.

637
00:57:46,164 --> 00:57:47,706
Ananenko.

638
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:53,539
Bezpalov.

639
00:57:58,706 --> 00:58:00,539
Baranov.
