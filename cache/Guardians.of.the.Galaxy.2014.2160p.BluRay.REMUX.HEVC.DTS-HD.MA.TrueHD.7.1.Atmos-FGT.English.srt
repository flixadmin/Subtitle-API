00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,843
We know only that
she has been captured.

486
00:32:08,844 --> 00:32:10,929
Gamora may yet recover the Orb.

487
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:15,350
<i>No! Our sources within the Kyln say
Gamora has her own plans for the Orb.</i>

488
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:18,061
<i>Look, your partnership with Thanos</i>

489
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:19,980
<i>is at risk.</i>

490
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:24,484
<i>Thanos requires your presence. Now!</i>

491
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:34,119
RONAN: With all due respect, Thanos,
your daughter made this mess,

492
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,704
and yet you summon me.

493
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,706
I would lower my voice, Accuser.

494
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,875
First, she lost a battle
with some primitive.

495
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,751
Thanos put Gamora under your charge.

496
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:44,629
RONAN: Then she was apprehended
by the Nova Corps.

497
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,631
You are the one here
with nothing to show for it.

498
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:50,802
Your sources say that she meant
to betray us the whole time!

499
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,179
Lower your tone!

500
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,346
I may be your...

501
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:05,442
I only ask that you take
this matter seriously.

502
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:10,280
The only matter
I do not take seriously, boy,

503
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:11,948
is you.

504
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:15,202
Your politics bore me.

505
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:18,455
Your demeanor is that of a pouty child.

506
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:23,251
And, apparently, you alienated
my favorite daughter, Gamora.

507
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:28,798
I shall honor our agreement, Kree,

508
00:33:28,882 --> 00:33:30,675
if you bring me the Orb.

509
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:34,095
But return to me again empty-handed,

510
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,599
and I will bathe the starways
in your blood.

511
00:33:40,936 --> 00:33:42,812
Thanks, Dad. Sounds fair.

512
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:47,859
This is one fight you won't win.

513
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:50,779
Let's head to the Kyln.

514
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,497
ROCKET: If we're gonna get out of here,

515
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,332
we're gonna need to
get into that watchtower.

516
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:04,167
And to do that,
I'm gonna need a few things.

517
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,795
The guards wear security bands

518
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:09,339
to control their ins and outs. I need one.

519
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,174
Leave it to me.

520
00:34:11,341 --> 00:34:14,177
ROCKET: That dude, there.
I need his prosthetic leg.

521
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:15,929
PETER: His leg?
ROCKET: Yeah.

522
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:18,139
God knows I don't need the rest of him.
Look at him, he's useless.

523
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,641
All right.

524
00:34:19,808 --> 00:34:24,020
And finally, on the wall back there
is a black panel. Blinky yellow light.

525
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,189
- Do you see it?
- Yeah.

526
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:30,402
There's a quarnyx battery behind it.
Purplish box, green wires.

527
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,654
To get into that watchtower,
I definitely need it.

528
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,155
How are we supposed to do that?

529
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,533
Well, supposably,
these bald-bodies find you attractive.

530
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:38,243
So, maybe you can work out
some sort of trade.

531
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,494
You must be joking.

532
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,371
No, I really heard
they find you attractive.

533
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,081
Look, it's 20 feet up in the air,

534
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,584
and it's in the middle of the most
heavily-guarded part of the prison.

535
00:34:45,667 --> 00:34:48,420
It's impossible to get up there
without being seen.

536
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:49,546
I got one plan,

537
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:51,756
and that plan requires
a frickin' quarnyx battery,

538
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,924
so figure it out!

539
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:54,134
Oh!

540
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,261
Can I get back to it? Thanks.

541
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:58,263
Now, this is important.

542
00:34:58,346 --> 00:34:59,931
Once the battery is removed,

543
00:35:00,015 --> 00:35:02,434
everything is gonna slam
into emergency mode.

544
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:05,228
Once we have it, we gotta move quickly,

545
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:08,189

00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:56,262
Man, you wouldn't believe
what they charge for fuel out here.

811
00:50:56,345 --> 00:50:58,597
I might actually lose money on this job.

812
00:50:58,764 --> 00:51:00,391
GAMORA:
My connection is making us wait.

813
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:04,853
It's just a negotiation tactic.
Trust me, this is my specialty.

814
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,897
Where yours is more,

815
00:51:07,147 --> 00:51:09,900
"Stab, stab. Those are my terms."

816
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:12,611
My father didn't stress diplomacy.

817
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:13,821
Thanos?

818
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:16,949
He's not my father.

819
00:51:18,242 --> 00:51:19,577
When Thanos took my home world,

820
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,996
he killed my parents in front of me.

821
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:24,415
He tortured me,

822
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:27,001
turned me into a weapon.

823
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:31,505
When he said he was going to destroy
an entire planet for Ronan,

824
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:33,632
I couldn't stand by and...

825
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,514
Why would you risk your life for this?

- (ROMANTIC POP SONG PLAYING)

827
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,184
My mother gave it to me.

828
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:48,939
My mom liked sharing with me all the
pop songs that she loved growing up.

829
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:50,024
I happened to have it on me,

830
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,359
when I was...

831
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,945
The day that she...

832
00:51:57,364 --> 00:51:59,116
You know, when I left Earth.

833
00:52:00,034 --> 00:52:01,243
GAMORA: What do you do with it?

834
00:52:01,410 --> 00:52:05,080
Do? Nothing. You listen to it.
Or you can dance.

835
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:09,877
I'm a warrior and an assassin.
I do not dance.

836
00:52:10,044 --> 00:52:11,211
Really?

837
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:15,549
On my planet,
there's a legend about people like you.

838
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:17,009
It's called

<i>Footloose.</i>

00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:22,723
And in it, a great hero

841
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:24,183
named Kevin Bacon,

842
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:29,772
teaches an entire city full of people with
sticks up their butts that dancing, well...

843
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,900
It's the greatest thing there is.

844
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:35,319
Who put the sticks up their butts?

845
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:36,904
What? No, that's just a...

846
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:38,864
- That is cruel.
- It's just a phrase

he knows nothing about!

- He has no respect!

Rocket, you're drunk. All right?
No one's laughing at you.

He thinks I'm some stupid thing!
He does!

Well, I didn't ask to get made!

Rocket, no one's calling you a monster.

He called me "vermin"!

I'm not gonna kill
every last one of you jerks.

none of you have any friends!

Five seconds after you meet somebody,
you're already trying to kill them!

00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:58,522
Oh, my dear Gamora.

903
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:01,733
How wonderful to meet in the flesh.

904
00:56:01,942 --> 00:56:04,444
Let's bypass the formalities, Tivan.

905
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:07,406
We have what we discussed.

906

Sir...

910
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:26,091
You must allow me to pay you now
so that I may own your carcass.

911
00:56:26,258 --> 00:56:29,136
At the moment of your death, of course.

912

I am Groot.

00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:33,432
Why, so he could turn you
into a frickin' chair?

914
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:34,558
That's your pet?

- His what?
- Tivan.

916
00:56:38,145 --> 00:56:41,899
We have been halfway
around the galaxy, retrieving this Orb.

917
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,109
Very well, then.

918
00:56:44,276 --> 00:56:46,778
Let us see what you brought.

919
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:03,170
DISPATCHER: Three quarnyx batteries,
seven cases of Cotati seeds.

920
00:57:03,337 --> 00:57:06,673
No, cases. Last time, you sent me...

921
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:07,883
Uh...

922
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:11,219
You shall send a message for me.

923
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:13,096
Oh, my new friends.

924
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:17,559
Before creation itself,

925
00:57:17,726 --> 00:57:19,436
there were six singularities.

926
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:25,400
Then the universe exploded
into existence,

927
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:27,611
and the remnants of these systems

928
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:31,198
were forged into concentrated ingots.

929
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:34,242
- (WHIRRING)
- Infinity Stones.

930
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:36,870
These stones, it seems,

931
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:38,872
can only be brandished

932
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:42,501
by beings of extraordinary strength.

933
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:43,710
Observe.

934
00:57:46,922 --> 00:57:52,761
These carriers can use the Stone
to mow down entire civilizations

935
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:56,348
like wheat in a field.

936
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:00,102
There's a little pee
coming out of me right now.

937
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:02,145
Once, for a moment,

938
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:06,358
a group was able to share
the energy amongst themselves,

939
00:58:06,525 --> 00:58:09,486
but even they
were quickly destroyed by it.

940
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:17,369
Beautiful.

941
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:21,623

942
00:58:21,707 --> 00:58:23,709
Blah, blah, blah.

943
00:58:23,792 --> 00:58:27,462
We're all very fascinated, whitey.
But we'd like to get paid.

946
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:35,512
TIVAN: Very well, then.

948
00:58:42,811 --> 00:58:43,812

leave it in there?

I can't believe you had that
in your purse!

It's not a purse, it's a knapsack!

962
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:58,720
We have to bring this
to the Nova Corps.

963
00:59:59,304 --> 01:00:00,722
There's a chance they can contain it.

964

ROCKET: Are you kidding me?

965
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:04,810
We're wanted by the Nova Corps.
Just give it to Ronan!

966
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:06,186
So he can destroy the galaxy?

967
01:00:06,353 --> 01:00:08,146
What are you,
some saint all of a sudden?

968
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:11,274
What has the galaxy ever done for you?
Why would you wanna save it?

969
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:13,151
Because I'm one of the idiots
who lives in it!

970
01:00:13,235 --> 01:00:14,694
Peter, listen to me.

971
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:17,948
We cannot allow the Stone

why we should believe him?

He said his crew
just escaped from prison

01:22:37,744 --> 01:22:40,706
so he'd have no other reason
to risk coming to Xandar to help.

ROCKET: Question.

01:49:13,255 --> 01:49:14,381
What if I see something
that I want to take,

1621
01:49:14,465 --> 01:49:15,799
and it belongs to someone else?

DEY: You will be arrested.

1623
01:49:17,259 --> 01:49:19,470
But what if I want it more
than the person who has it?

1624
01:49:19,970 --> 01:49:21,972
- It's still illegal.
- That doesn't follow.

1625
01:49:22,139 --> 01:49:23,140
No, I want it more, sir.

Why? I can't have a discussion
with this gentleman?

What if someone
does something irksome

1629
01:49:28,645 --> 01:49:30,814
and I decide to remove his spine?

That's...

1631
01:49:34,610 --> 01:49:36,820
That's actually murder.

1632
01:49:38,614 --> 01:49:41,158
It's one of the worst crimes of all.

1633
01:49:41,325 --> 01:49:44,161
So... also illegal.

1634

Hmm.

They'll be fine, Dey.
