Just the simple promise of his freedom.

830
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,903
You ruined my life! All our lives!

831
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:10,439
We stood by you after
everything that happened.

832
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,407
I can see how this must be
difficult for you to understand,

833
00:35:13,409 --> 00:35:16,075
but trust me,

834
00:35:16,077 --> 00:35:18,610
your lives now are so much better

835
00:35:18,612 --> 00:35:21,212
because of what I have done for you.

836
00:35:21,214 --> 00:35:22,580
(West) You don't have to hide anymore.

837
00:35:22,582 --> 00:35:23,915
We know you're not Harrison Wells.

838
00:35:23,917 --> 00:35:25,149
Just tell us who you are.

839
00:35:25,151 --> 00:35:28,550
A confession will get you nowhere.

840
00:35:28,552 --> 00:35:31,286
You've seen who I am.

841
00:35:31,288 --> 00:35:32,322
You know what I can do.

842
00:35:32,324 --> 00:35:34,793
You want to kill me, go ahead.

843
00:35:34,795 --> 00:35:35,993
I'm not gonna fight you.

844
00:35:35,995 --> 00:35:38,493
But just tell the police what you did.

845
00:35:38,495 --> 00:35:39,894
Get my dad out of prison.

846
00:35:39,896 --> 00:35:41,428
(Wells) I don't want to kill you, Barry.

847
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,430
I need you.

848
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:44,898
And...

849
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:48,034
[chuckles]

850
00:35:48,036 --> 00:35:49,870
I also did not anticipate,

851
00:35:49,872 --> 00:35:52,272
as difficult as the past
15 years have been for me,

852
00:35:52,274 --> 00:35:55,520
how much I would come
to love working with you.

853
00:35:55,545 --> 00:35:57,441
With all of you.

854
00:35:57,443 --> 00:36:01,046
And yet, that does not
change what needs to happen.

855
00:36:01,048 --> 00:36:02,948
Then face me now!

856
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:07,495
Oh, we will face each other again.

857
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,652
I promise you. Soon.

858
00:36:09,654 --> 00:36:13,388
Very, very soon.

859
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:15,124
[cell phone vibrates]

860
00:36:15,126 --> 00:36:16,626
He's in the time vault!

861
00:36:16,628 --> 00:36:17,594
Barry!

862
00:36:17,596 --> 00:36:20,531
[tense music]

863
00:36:33,781 --> 00:36:36,914
It was all a set-up.

864
00:36:36,916 --> 00:36:38,413
We thought we set a trap for him,

865
00:36:38,415 --> 00:36:40,381
but he set a trap for us.

866
00:36:45,417 --> 00:36:47,583
Oh, my God.

867
00:36:47,585 --> 00:36:48,926
Iris.

868
00:36:55,793 --> 00:36:56,760
We have to find Iris.

869
00:36:56,762 --> 00:36:58,096
- Why?
- Wells.

870
00:36:58,098 --> 00:36:59,566
He's been watching all of us.

871
00:36:59,568 --> 00:37:01,437
He has surveillance
footage set up everywhere.

872
00:37:01,439 --> 00:37:03,505
Our homes, my lab at the police station,

873
00:37:03,507 --> 00:37:06,142
Central City Picture News.

874
00:37:06,144 --> 00:37:08,645
Cisco, call me when you have a location.

875
00:37:08,647 --> 00:37:11,211
[dramatic music]

876
00:37:13,182 --> 00:37:16,494
(Iris) I am very much enjoying this stroll.

877
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:18,255
We needed a good stroll.

878
00:37:18,257 --> 00:37:20,657
- Yeah.
- [chuckles]

879
00:37:20,659 --> 00:37:24,626
Actually, though, would you mind
if we park here for a second?

880
00:37:24,628 --> 00:37:25,660
[cell phone vibrating]

881
00:37:25,662 --> 00:37:27,893
Um...

882
00:37:27,895 --> 00:37:29,627
Oh, it's my dad.

883
00:37:29,629 --> 00:37:32,264
Could you call him back later?

884
00:37:32,266 --> 00:37:34,168
Sure.

885
00:37:34,193 --> 00:37:35,984
What's going on?

886
00:37:36,014 --> 00:37:39,849
Iris, this week, when I was arrested

887
00:37:39,874 --> 00:37:42,906
and it looked bad,

888
00:37:42,908 --> 00:37:44,507
you never wavered.

889
00:37:44,509 --> 00:37:46,343
You never lost faith in me.

890
00:37:46,345 --> 00:37:48,081
Impossible.

891
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:55,118
And even though we've been
through some rough times,

892
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,319
I've never lost faith in us.

893
00:37:57,321 --> 00:38:00,855
[gentle music]

894
00:38:00,857 --> 00:38:04,126
Iris West.

895
00:38:04,128 --> 00:38:05,595
Eddie?

896
00:38:05,597 --> 00:38:09,998
[tense music]

897
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,167
Eddie!

898
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,700
Bad timing, Detective.

899
00:38:17,381 --> 00:38:19,116
Stop! Leave him alone!

900
00:38:19,118 --> 00:38:21,486
Iris, no!

901
00:38:24,595 --> 00:38:26,029
I know who you are.

902
00:38:26,031 --> 00:38:27,997
You killed Barry's mom.

903
00:38:27,999 --> 00:38:29,900
But you don't have to hurt anyone else.

904
00:38:33,072 --> 00:38:34,506
[gasps]

905
00:38:34,508 --> 00:38:36,575
- [yelps]
- Hey, Iris.

906
00:38:36,577 --> 00:38:37,676
It's okay. It's me.

907
00:38:37,678 --> 00:38:39,044
He took him.

908
00:38:39,046 --> 00:38:40,245
The Man in Yellow, he took Eddie.

909
00:38:40,247 --> 00:38:42,248
I promise I will find him, okay?

910
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:45,585
- What is happening?
- This is *** and I'm alone***

911
00:38:45,587 --> 00:38:47,555
Don't say anything to anyone.

912
00:38:47,557 --> 00:38:50,027
I swear to you, I will
bring him back, all right?

913
00:38:50,029 --> 00:38:51,562
Wait, stop. [electricity crackles]

914
00:38:51,564 --> 00:38:55,131
[triumphant music]

915
00:38:55,133 --> 00:38:56,901
Barry?

916
00:39:09,788 --> 00:39:11,923
[groans]

917
00:39:11,925 --> 00:39:15,493
You might as well take that mask off.

918
00:39:15,495 --> 00:39:18,999
I know it's you, Wells.
Or whoever you really are.

919
00:39:19,001 --> 00:39:25,502
Well, allow to to introduce myself.

920
00:39:25,504 --> 00:39:29,510
My name is Eobard.

921
00:39:29,512 --> 00:39:33,013
Eobard Thawne.

922
00:39:33,015 --> 00:39:35,852
I don't understand.

923
00:39:35,854 --> 00:39:38,021
Why do you have my name?

924
00:39:38,023 --> 00:39:39,689
Why?

925
00:39:39,691 --> 00:39:44,560
Well, 'cause we're family, Eddie.

926
00:39:44,562 --> 00:39:47,564
Funny, I haven't seen you
at any reunions or weddings.

927
00:39:47,566 --> 00:39:48,901
[chuckles] That is funny.

928
00:39:48,903 --> 00:39:51,505
And the reason for that

929
00:39:51,507 --> 00:39:56,408
is because as far as those
guest lists are concerned,

930
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:59,477
I haven't been born yet.

931
00:39:59,479 --> 00:40:03,451
So that's why you didn't kill
me that night at S.T.A.R. Labs?

932
00:40:03,453 --> 00:40:05,753
[dramatic music]

933
00:40:05,755 --> 00:40:09,258
This whole thing...

934
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,491
It's been about me?

935
00:40:10,493 --> 00:40:12,193
Not a chance.

936
00:40:12,195 --> 00:40:15,928
You, my friend,

937
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:18,096
are simply my insurance.

938
00:40:20,198 --> 00:40:22,199
[machine beeping]

939
00:40:22,201 --> 00:40:24,834
[chuckles]

940
00:40:24,836 --> 00:40:26,501
You look so young.

941
00:40:26,503 --> 00:40:29,438
[solemn music]

942
00:40:31,543 --> 00:40:34,879
And I could kill you

943
00:40:34,881 --> 00:40:38,050
right now so easy.

944
00:40:44,326 --> 00:40:46,894
What I wouldn't have given...

945
00:40:46,896 --> 00:40:48,462
[sighs]

946
00:40:48,464 --> 00:40:52,869
All those times before
to have had you like this.

947
00:40:52,871 --> 00:40:54,737
So...

948
00:40:54,739 --> 00:40:56,304
helpless.

949
00:40:57,232 --> 00:40:59,905
But fate,

950
00:40:59,907 --> 00:41:02,940
it's tricky, isn't it?

951
00:41:02,942 --> 00:41:05,841
I come here to destroy you...

952
00:41:08,849 --> 00:41:10,482
And then to get home, I have to be the one

953
00:41:10,484 --> 00:41:14,217
who creates you.

954
00:41:14,219 --> 00:41:16,219
[chuckles]

955
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:22,692
But I will say,

956
00:41:22,694 --> 00:41:24,162
it's been an education...

957
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,102
Watching you grow up all these years.

958
00:41:29,104 --> 00:41:33,636
Science fairs and soccer games.

959
00:41:33,638 --> 00:41:36,273
No hint, no sign,

960
00:41:36,275 --> 00:41:40,210
no trace of the man you will be one day

961
00:41:40,212 --> 00:41:43,178
for whom I have nothing but hate.

962
00:41:43,874 --> 00:41:45,874
And to be clear,

963
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:49,890
nothing is forgiven

964
00:41:51,031 --> 00:41:53,031
You will be eradicated.

965
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:57,075
I promise you, Barry Allan,

966
00:41:58,504 --> 00:42:00,504
that you will die.

967
