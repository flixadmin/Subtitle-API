1
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,660
High septon:
May the warrior Grant him courage

2
00:01:58,744 --> 00:02:01,705
and protect him in these perilous times.

3
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:03,915
May the Smith Grant him strength

4
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:06,335
that he might bear this heavy burden.

5
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:08,128
And may the crone,

6
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,922
she that knows the fate of all men,

7
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:13,216
show him the path he must walk

8
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,179
and guide him through the dark places
that lie ahead.

9
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,472
In the light of the seven,

10
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:21,642
I now proclaim tommen
of the house Baratheon,

11
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:23,268
first of his name,

12
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:25,646
king of the andals and the first men

13
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:28,398
and lord of the seven kingdoms.

14
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,487
Long may he reign!

15
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,405
All: Long may he reign!

16
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:38,075
(Cheering)

17
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:47,751
Special day.

18
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,636
(Crowd chatting)

19
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,938
Your grace.

20
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:11,692
Your grace.

21
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,884
Crowd: Your grace.

22
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,152
Your grace.

23
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,073
There he is.

24
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:02,784
Long may he reign.

25
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,327
Long may he reign.

26
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:11,126
He sits the throne like he was born to it.

27
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,421
Yes. He wasn't, though, was he?

28
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:16,923
No, he wasn't.

29
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,265
You still mourn for Joffrey?

30
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,267
He was my husband. My king.

31
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,710
He would have been your nightmare.

32
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,567
Your grace, I feel...

33
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,569
You knew exactly what he was.

34
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,696
I did, too.

35
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,409
You never love anything in the world
the way you love your first child.

36
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:48,538
Doesn't matter what they do.

37
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,877
And what he did, it shocked me.

38
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,507
Do you think I'm easin shocked?

39
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:03,220
The things he did shocked me.

40
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:11,770
He's only a boy.

41
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,065
A good, decent boy. He always has been.

42
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:19,486
Who was the last decent king, I wonder?

43
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:23,990
He could be the first man who sits on that
throne in 50 years to actually deserve it.

44
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:28,787
It would be some consolation, wouldn't it?

45
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,122
For all the horror that put him there.

46
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,922
He will need help

47
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:41,925
if he's going to rule well.

48
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,010
He has you.

49
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,345
A mother is not enough.

50
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:51,101
You're still interested in being queen?

51
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:52,561
(Scoffs)

52
00:05:53,228 --> 00:05:54,938
After all that's happened?

53
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:01,278
It sounds strange, but I am...

54
00:06:01,403 --> 00:06:05,448
I haven't even given any thought to it,
what comes next.

55
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,451
It would be a great honour, of course.

56
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:12,122
But I will have to speak
to my father about it.

57
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,126
Yes, speak to your father.

58
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:19,254
I'll speak to mine.

59
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:28,138
We may be faced with an alarming number
of weddings soon.

60
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:30,807
- (Chuckles)
- I won't even know what to call you.

61
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:33,643
Sister?

62
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:37,731
Or mother?

63
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,399
(Chuckles)

64
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,737
Jorah: King Joffrey Baratheon is dead.

65
00:06:45,864 --> 00:06:47,490
Murdered at his own wedding.

66
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,785
Barristan: And we've taken
the meereenese Navy, your grace.

67
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,913
The second sons took the Navy.

68
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,956
Who told you to?

69
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,125
No one.

70
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,586
So why did you do it?

71
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:01,755
I heard you liked ships.

72
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:07,344
How many ships?

73
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:08,762
93, your grace.

74
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,305
How many men can they carry?

75
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,891
9,300, not counting sailors.

76
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:14,809
Would that be enough
to take king's landing?

77
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,020
The lannisters have more.

78
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,384
Barristan: They've been fighting
Joffrey's wars for years.

79
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,191
They're tired, dispersed.

80
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,360
And now their king is dead.

81
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,404
8,000 unsullied, 2,000 second sons

82
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:29,824
sailing into Blackwater bay

83
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:32,494
and storming the gates without warning.

84
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,124
It's hard to say. It could be enough.

85
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,503
But we're not fighting to make you
queen of king's landing.

86
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:44,589
10,000 men can't conquer Westeros.

87
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:46,400
Barristan: The old houses
will flock to our queen

88
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,926
when she crosses the narrow sea.

89
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,738
Jorah: The old houses will flock to
whichever side they think will win,

90
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:52,764
as they always have.

91
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:57,352
There's other news.

92
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,270
From yunkai.

93
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:02,273
Without the unsullied to enforce your rule,

94
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,734
the wise masters have
retaken control of the city.

95
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,279
They've reenslaved the freedmen
who stayed behind

96
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:10,740
and sworn to take revenge against you.

97
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,994
And in astapor,

98
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,663
the council you installed
to rule over the city

99
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,833
has been overthrown
by a butcher named cleon

100
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,086
who's declared himself
"his imperial majesty."

101
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,090
Daenerys: Please leave me.

102
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,305
Not you, jorah.

103
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:51,197
It appears my liberation of slaver's bay
isn't going quite as planned.

104
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:57,287
You could sail for Westeros
and leave it all behind.

105
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,205
A boy sits on the iron throne.

106
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:03,376
A boy many believe to be
a bastard with no right to it.

107
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,837
They've never been more vulnerable.

108
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,631
You counselled me against
rashness once in qarth.

109
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:11,301
I didn't listen.

110
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,344
That all worked out well.

111
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,472
(Chuckles)

112
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:23,146
How can I rule seven kingdoms

113
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,983
if I can't control slaver's bay?

114
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:29,861
Why should anyone trust me,

115
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,530
follow me?

116
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,074
You're a Targaryen,

117
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,326
the mother of dragons.

118
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,413
I need to be more than that.

119
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:52,008
I will not let those I have freed
slide back into chains.

120
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:54,677
I will not sail for Westeros.

121
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,721
What, then?

122
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:00,391
I will do what queens do.

123
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,064
I will rule.

124
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,309
Pull up your hood.

125
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,522
A memorable shade.

126
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,608
But how would they know?

127
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:54,320
You know what kind of stories
poor men enjoy the most?

128
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:57,157
Ones about rich girls they'll never meet.

129
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,913
Is this the only way into the eyrie?

130
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:06,207
The mountains are impassable.

131
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,544
If you want to get to the eyrie,
you need to go through the bloody gate.

132
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,089
It doesn't matter how large your army is,

133
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:15,967
if you attack this gate,
you do it on this road,

134
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,927
three men abreast,

135
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:20,513
and get slaughtered like goats.

136
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:23,534
The first lords of the
vale didn't have much,

137
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:27,353
but they had these mountains
and they knew how to use them.

138
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:29,290
And the fortress they built here
has never been overcome.

139
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:32,108
Not once in 1,000 years.

140
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:35,987
Know your strengths, use them wisely,

141
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,157
and one man can be worth 10,000.

142
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:45,747
Knight: Who would pass the bloody gate?

143
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,750
Lord petyr baelish and his niece alayne.

144
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:54,797
Stand to.

145
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:57,175
Knights: Stand to!

146
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,136
Welcome back, lord baelish.

147
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,515
(Gate clanking)

148
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:29,749
(Door opens)

149
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,544
Uncle petyr!

150
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,923
Littlefinger: My lord.

151
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:49,560
I have brought you a gift.

152
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,358
Lord baelish.

153
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:58,027
- My lady.
- Look what uncle petyr brought me.

154
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,697
A beautiful gift for a beautiful boy.

155
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,366
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance,
lady arryn.

156
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:07,912
- My name is...
- Oh, do take down that hood, child.

157
00:13:07,996 --> 00:13:09,664
Don't you think I know who you are?

158
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:13,876
You think I'd let my intended
leave the eyrie on urgent business

159
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:17,130
without knowing what that business was?

160
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:22,385
I let him go so he could
bring you here to me.

161
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:28,558
My flesh and blood.

162
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:32,478
It's wonderful to meet you, aunt lysa.

163
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,689
You mustn't call me that
in front of anyone else.

164
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,525
- I understand.
- No one can know you're here.

165
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,736
It would put us in a
very precarious position.

166
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,362
I would never say a thing.

167
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,656
The lannisters want to destroy us.

168
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,825
They've been trying for years.

169
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,869
Now they know what it feels like.

170
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:51,581
Mummy said they killed your mother
and they chopped off your brother's head.

171
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,878
They did, and my father's.

172
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:59,714
They killed my father, too, with poison.

173
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:04,093
I wanted to make the little
Lannister baby man fly, (chuckles)

174
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:05,970
But mother said I couldn't.

175
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,805
Make him fly?

176
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,724
Through the moon door.

177
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,312
(Giggles)

178
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,731
Lysa: And on top of everything else,

179
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:19,150
they made you marry that filthy troll.

180
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:22,862
They made us both.
Lord Tyrion didn't want to.

181
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,822
Lysa: I don't believe that.

182
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,949
Did he force himself on you?

183
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:30,286
- No. We never...
- Lysa: Good.

184
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:33,581
Robin, this is your cousin sansa.

185
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,664
But you're not to call her sansa
in front of anyone

186
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,752
but uncle petyr and myself.
Do you understand?

187
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,962
Sansa, this is my son Robin.

188
00:14:41,464 --> 00:14:43,299
It's a pleasure to meet you, Robin.

189
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:47,428
Robin, show sansa to her chamber.
Take the back stairs.

190
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,642
Go. We'll speak soon.

191
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,028
What took you so long?

192
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:06,781
Arranging for the ascension
of king tommen I,

193
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:10,326
extricating sansa, getting her here alive.

194
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:14,580
She's here. We've spent more than
enough time on her for one evening.

195
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,418
Let's get married tonight.

196
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:21,254
Ought we not...

197
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,923
Inform the lords of the vale
about the ceremony?

198
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,800
(Huffs) There's only one lord of the vale.

199
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:27,718
The others can all hang.

200
00:15:27,802 --> 00:15:31,931
Lurking and simpering on the stairs
like buzzards the moment my husband died,

201
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,974
- trying to get their claws in me.
- I do think that we could wait until...

202
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:37,395
I'm done waiting, petyr.

203
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,773
We had our wedding night many years ago.

204
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:42,024
Or don't you remember?

205
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,694
Like it was yesterday.

206
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:49,073
What wife would do for you
the things I've done?

207
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:52,201
What wife would trust you
the way I've trusted you?

208
00:15:52,827 --> 00:15:54,871
When you gave me those drops

209
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:57,415
and told me to pour them into Jon's wine,

210
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,041
my husband's wine.

211
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,253
When you told me to write a letter to cat

212
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,754
telling her it was the...

213
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,216
(Lysa moaning)

214
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:18,728
The deed is done.

215
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,981
Faded into nothing.

216
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:24,317
Only speaking of it can make it real.

217
00:16:28,154 --> 00:16:29,447
Tonight it is, then.

218
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,449
(Laughs)

219
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,453
Let me bathe and dress for the occasion.

220
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:39,248
Once I'm presentable,
I'll call on the septon immediately.

221
00:16:46,589 --> 00:16:49,008
I'm warning you.

222
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:52,470
I'm going to scream when
my husband makes love to me.

223
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:58,935
So loud they'll hear me
clear across the narrow sea.

224
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,856
(Lysa screaming)

225
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,069
(Grunting)

226
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:12,657
(Screaming)

227
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,706
(Screaming continues)

228
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:27,004
Tywin: When will the wedding take place
in your mind?

229
00:17:27,088 --> 00:17:28,965
Cersei: As soon as decency permits.

230
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:33,719
After we've allowed tommen
the appropriate time to mourn his brother

231
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,471
and margaery to mourn her husband.

232
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:38,724
- A fortnight?
- That seems reasonable.

233
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:42,019
No jugglers, no jousting dwarves,

234
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,355
no 77-course meals.

235
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,776
And your wedding to loras?

236
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,571
Shortly after tommen's.

237
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,823
- Shortly?
- A fortnight.

238
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:57,618
I know you don't like them.

239
00:17:57,702 --> 00:17:59,787
I didn't like your husband.

240
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,290
Used to pat me on the back a lot.

241
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:03,624
I didn't trust him.

242
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,668
We had that in common.

243
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:10,256
You don't need to make formal alliances
with people you trust.

244
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,842
Then whom can we trust?

245
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,511
Ourselves alone.

246
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:20,516
The tyrells

247
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,729
are our only true rivals
in terms of resources

248
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,940
and we need them on our side.

249
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:30,818
Robert wasn't particularly rich.

250
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,529
Robert had me funding him.

251
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:37,033
Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.

252
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,578
I suppose that explains
why we did so well in the last one.

253
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:44,332
Do you know how much gold was mined
in the westerlands this past year?

254
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:45,499
Haven't a clue.

255
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,293
Your best guess.

256
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:50,087
Pounds, tons, ounces?

257
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:52,381
Doesn't matter. The answer is the same.

258
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,134
Can't be.

259
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:58,179
Our last working mine
ran dry three years ago.

260
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,390
Then how do we pay for anything?

261
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:05,603
The crown owes the iron bank of braavos
a tremendous amount of money.

262
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:07,146
How much?

263
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:10,858
A tremendous amount.

264
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:16,906
There must be someone at the iron bank
you can speak to, come to some arrangement.

265
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,368
The iron bank is the iron bank.
There is no someone.

266
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:22,995
Someone does work there.
It is comprised of people.

267
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:25,247
And a temple is comprised of stones.

268
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:28,501
One stone crumbles
and another takes its place.

269
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:32,922
And the temple holds its form
for 1,000 years or more.

270
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:36,509
That's what the iron bank is, a temple.

271
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:40,096
We all live in its shadow
and almost none of us know it.

272
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,474
You can't run from them.
You can't cheat them.

273
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,727
You can't sway them with excuses.

274
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:50,439
If you owe them money
and you don't want to crumble yourself,

275
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,108
you pay it back.

276
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:56,028
Vesting the tyrells in the crown
will help a great deal.

277
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:59,615
It's for the good of the family,
I understand that.

278
00:20:03,244 --> 00:20:05,329
I'm not sure my brothers do.

279
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,837
I know you're building a strong case
against Tyrion.

280
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:16,090
And as a mother, that is your right.

281
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:20,511
But as a judge,
I cannot discuss the trial with you.

282
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,930
I respect that.

283
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,184
We don't need to discuss it.

284
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:34,066
The Lannister legacy
is the only thing that matters.

285
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:36,569
You've started wars to protect this family.

286
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:41,991
Turned your back on Jaime
for refusing to contribute to its future.

287
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:45,536
What does Tyrion deserve

288
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,747
for lighting that future on fire?

289
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,967
Arya: Joffrey.

290
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,969
Cersei.

291
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:04,263
Walder frey.

292
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,389
Meryn trant.

293
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,100
Tywin Lannister.

294
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:11,228
The red woman.

295
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:13,689
Beric dondarrion.

296
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:17,276
Thoros of myr.

297
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,694
Ilyn Payne.

298
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,571
The mountain.

299
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,615
Would you shut up?

300
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,202
I can't sleep until I say the names.

301
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,789
The names of
every fucking person in Westeros?

302
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:32,500
Only the ones I'm going to kill.

303
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:33,667
(Chuckles)

304
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:37,129
Hate's as good a thing as any
to keep a person going.

305
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:39,215
Better than most.

306
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,719
We come across my brother,

307
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:46,639
maybe we can both
cross a name off our list.

308
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:52,353
If he were here right
now, what would you do?

309
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:04,406
I'd tell him to shut the fuck up
so I can get some sleep.

310
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:12,832
Go on, get it over with,
your list of doomed men.

311
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:17,211
I'm almost done.

312
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:19,630
Only one name left.

313
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,132
Go on.

314
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,767
The hound.

315
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:40,401
Sansa: Thank you.

316
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,361
Your mother always had a sweet tooth.

317
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,988
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

318
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:47,157
At suppertime,
she would go straight for honey cakes,

319
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:48,868
candied almonds, custard.

320
00:22:48,951 --> 00:22:50,411
Anything sweet.

321
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:54,832
Eventually, your grandfather had to assign
a septa to watch her at meals.

322
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:57,376
Cat was the firstborn daughter after all.

323
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,062
It was important that she remain desirable

324
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,630
so father could arrange
a good match for her

325
00:23:01,714 --> 00:23:04,300
and she was starting to get fat.

326
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,969
My mother fat?

327
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,387
(Both chuckle lightly)

328
00:23:09,555 --> 00:23:13,267
She never let me have my pudding
until I'd finished all my proper food.

329
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,604
This is before she married your father
and moved to the north.

330
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:20,190
By the time you were born,
your father's austerity had become hers.

331
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:23,152
Marriage changes people.

332
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:26,322
(Gasps)

333
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,950
I didn't mean for you to stop. Enjoy them.

334
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:35,956
How do you like them?

335
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,000
They're delicious.

336
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:43,464
Where did you get the lemons?
You can't grow them up here.

337
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,174
Oh, gods, no.

338
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:48,427
Petyr had three crates
brought all the way from king's landing.

339
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,554
He knew you liked lemon cakes.

340
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:51,931
He's so kind.

341
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:54,767
He really cares for you.

342
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,769
Think where you'd be without him.

343
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,146
In their clutches, on trial for murder.

344
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,525
Yes. I'm very lucky.

345
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,110
He feels responsible for you.

346
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:07,905
- Oh, I know he does. I'm so grateful.
- Why?

347
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:11,200
Why does he feel responsible for you?

348
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,955
Well, I'm half Tully.
He loved your family so much.

349
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:17,122
- Loved your mother.
- No.

350
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:18,749
That's what you wanted to say.

351
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:22,795
- He loves you, aunt lysa. He's married to you.
- Your mother never loved him.

352
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,547
Cat always went straight for
the sweetest thing.

353
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:28,634
The most obvious thing. Your uncle Brandon.

354
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:31,971
Your handsome, arrogant,
cruel uncle Brandon.

355
00:24:32,054 --> 00:24:34,181
He almost killed petyr in a duel.

356
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,433
And your mother loved him anyway.

357
00:24:36,517 --> 00:24:40,312
And now petyr is risking
his life to save you,

358
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,815
the daughter of a woman
who didn't love him.

359
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:46,068
No more than those whores in his brothels.

360
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,821
- Has he told you about them?
- No.

361
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:51,657
He hasn't told you about
the vile things they do with their bodies,

362
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,034
they let him do with their bodies?

363
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:55,869
- Never.
- Are you pregnant?

364
00:24:57,538 --> 00:25:00,541
What? No, I told you.
Lord Tyrion and I never...

365
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,459
I wasn't asking about Tyrion.

366
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,420
What have you let petyr do with your body?

367
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,172
- Aunt lysa, no, I...
- Your young, pretty body.

368
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:10,092
- Nothing. I'm a virgin.
- Don't lie to me.

369
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,427
You're hurting me.

370
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,763
I'll know if you lie.

371
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,349
I'm a virgin, I swear it.

372
00:25:17,433 --> 00:25:19,226
He loves you, aunt lysa.

373
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,186
All he says is that I'm stupid.

374
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:24,356
I'm a stupid little girl with stupid dreams
who never learns,

375
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,626
and I'm a terrible liar,
so I should always tell the truth.

376
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,944
And I swear to you that
he has never touched me.

377
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,280
- Not once, not ever.
- (Shushing)

378
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,867
It's all right.

379
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,910
It will all be all right.

380
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:38,495
You'll be a widow soon.

381
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:40,914
They'll execute that dwarf
for murdering the king

382
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:43,042
and you'll be free to marry Robin.

383
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:45,335
You'll be the lady of the vale.

384
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:46,628
Hmm.

385
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:56,638
(Horse whinnies)

386
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,811
(Grunting)

387
00:26:10,027 --> 00:26:12,112
Didn't they teach you how to ride a horse?

388
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:14,782
Yes, my lady, when I was young.

389
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:17,943
There wasn't much call for it
with lord Tyrion, though.

390
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:20,329
He preferred litters.

391
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,915
Perhaps you should have stayed with him.

392
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:31,340
It's not going to be
a pleasant journey for you.

393
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:34,802
It could take weeks to get to the wall,
depending on the weather.

394
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:36,553
Podrick: That's a long way off.

395
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:39,848
Well, lady sansa's
brother's at castle black.

396
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:42,893
If I were her, that's where I'd go.

397
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,686
Feel free to stop at any point.

398
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:47,648
Never, my lady. I'm your squire.

399
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:50,150
I've made it this far in the world
without a squire.

400
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:51,693
I don't see why I need one now.

401
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:54,905
- All knights have squires, my lady.
- I'm not a knight.

402
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:57,991
And I'm not a slaver,
either. I don't own you.

403
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:00,369
I swore an oath, my lady.

404
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,412
I am releasing you from that oath.

405
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:07,835
That means you could leave.

406
00:27:07,918 --> 00:27:09,086
I know.

407
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:12,756
What do you think will happen if you leave?

408
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:16,051
They'll say I wasn't a very good squire.

409
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,471
(Horse nickers)

410
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:21,348
(Whinnies)

411
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:13,984
- The hell you doing?
- Practising.

412
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:17,196
- What, ways to die?
- No one's going to kill me.

413
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,114
They will if you Nance around like that.

414
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,658
That's no way to fight.

415
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:24,620
It's not fighting. It's water dancing.

416
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:26,705
Dancing?

417
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,999
Maybe you ought to put on a dress.

418
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,295
Who taught you that shite?

419
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,255
The greatest swordsman who ever lived.

420
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:41,386
Syrio forel, the first sword
to the sealord of braavos.

421
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,888
Braavos. (Scoffs)

422
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,640
Greasy-haired little bastard, I bet.

423
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,099
They all are.

424
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:47,476
What do you know about anything?

425
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,770
I bet his hair is greasier
than Joffrey's cunt.

426
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,813
- It was not.
- Was? He dead?

427
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:52,898
- Yes.
- How?

428
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,608
- He was killed.
- Who by?

429
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,527
- Meryn trant. That's why ser meryn's on my...
- Meryn trant?

430
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:01,406
The greatest swordsman who ever lived
killed by meryn fucking trant?

431
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,450
- He was outnumbered.
- Any boy whore with a sword

432
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,369
could beat three meryn trants.

433
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,996
Syrio didn't have a sword.
Or armour. Just a stick.

434
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,361
The greatest swordsman who ever lived
didn't have a sword?

435
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,334
(Laughs)

436
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:16,004
All right. You have a sword.
Let's see what he taught you.

437
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,715
Go on, do it for your braavosi friend.

438
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,885
Dead like all the rest of your friends.

439
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,180
(Grunts)

440
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:36,858
Your friend's dead and meryn trant's not

441
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:41,280
'cause trant had armour
and a big fucking sword.

442
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:58,130
(Bird calling)

443
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,228
Your grace.

444
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:15,897
Prince oberyn. Writing letters?

445
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:19,192
A poem, actually.

446
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,987
May I show you the gardens?

447
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,032
I couldn't very well refuse a royal escort.

448
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:27,075
No, you couldn't.

449
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,747
I didn't realise you were a poet.

450
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,999
Not a very good one.

451
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,127
For your paramour?

452
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,962
For one of my daughters.

453
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:41,381
You have several, don't you?

454
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:42,674
Eight.

455
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:44,134
Eight?

456
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,553
Eight daughters?

457
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,555
Oberyn: The fifth is difficult.

458
00:30:48,638 --> 00:30:51,266
I named her after my sister elia.

459
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:54,436
- Beautiful name.
- Yes.

460
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,939
But I can't say it without turning sad.

461
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:00,901
And after I turn sad,

462
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,028
I grow angry.

463
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,947
Perhaps that's why she's difficult.

464
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:08,867
The gods love their
stupid jokes, don't they?

465
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,328
Which joke is that?

466
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:14,039
You're a prince of dorne.

467
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,749
A legendary fighter.

468
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:18,293
A brilliant man feared throughout Westeros.

469
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,213
But you could not save your sister.

470
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:26,843
I'm a Lannister. Queen for 19 years.
Daughter of the most powerful man alive.

471
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,471
But I could not save my son.

472
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:35,018
What good is power
if you cannot protect the ones you love?

473
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:36,728
We can avenge them.

474
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:39,272
Yes, we can avenge them.

475
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:43,527
You really believe Tyrion
murdered your son?

476
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,696
I know he did.

477
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:51,326
We will have a trial and
we will learn the truth.

478
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,912
We'll have a trial, anyway.

479
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,253
I haven't seen my daughter in over a year.

480
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,588
Oberyn: The last time I saw her,

481
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:06,675
she was swimming with two of my girls
in the water gardens.

482
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,470
Laughing in the sun.

483
00:32:11,555 --> 00:32:13,598
I want to believe that.

484
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:16,435
I want to believe she's happy.

485
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,603
You have my word.

486
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:21,731
We don't hurt little girls in dorne.

487
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:26,361
Everywhere in the
world, they hurt little girls.

488
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:38,457
Would you bring her a gift for me?

489
00:32:39,541 --> 00:32:41,251
I wasn't there for her nameday.

490
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:43,587
I don't know when I'll see her again.

491
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,964
Anything at all.

492
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:51,511
The best shipwrights in king's landing
have been working on it for months.

493
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:55,056
Myrcella loves the open water.

494
00:32:55,724 --> 00:32:58,977
Oberyn: I will have it sailed down
to sunspear for her.

495
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,439
Please tell her

496
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:07,194
her mother misses her very much.

497
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:18,705
Podrick: Oh, no.

498
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,582
No, no.

499
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:22,959
Hells.

500
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:28,298
Gods.

501
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,094
Did you remove the skin?

502
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,140
No, my lady.

503
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:38,934
Have you ever cooked a rabbit before?

504
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:41,394
No, my lady.

505
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:45,106
Did you ever cook anything for lord Tyrion?

506
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:47,150
No, my lady.

507
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,653
That was the cooks.

508
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:52,447
(Groans)

509
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,089
What are you doing?

510
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:11,007
I'm helping you with your armour.

511
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:14,011
I've been removing my own armour
for quite some time, thank you very much.

512
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,781
What exactly did you do for lord Tyrion?

513
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:38,159
I brought him his meals
and cleared his table when he was finished.

514
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,870
I kept his clothing and linens clean.

515
00:34:40,954 --> 00:34:43,248
Carried his messages
and returned the replies.

516
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,960
Mostly I poured wine.

517
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:50,964
Whilst in lord Tyrion's service,

518
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:54,050
did you ever do anything
remotely related to combat?

519
00:34:58,305 --> 00:34:59,347
I killed a man.

520
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:04,853
Who?

521
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:07,939
A kingsguard.

522
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:15,196
He tried to kill lord
Tyrion at the Blackwater.

523
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:21,369
How did you kill a kingsguard?

524
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,624
I pushed a spear through
the back of his head.

525
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,638
Bloody ridiculous.

526
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,893
Help me with these straps.

527
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:57,864
- (Woman whimpering)
- (Rast laughing)

528
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,705
Rast: Hey.

529
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,375
- Get up.
- (Woman sobbing)

530
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:10,418
Get up.

531
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:20,095
Man: That's it, lad, put it inside.

532
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,013
Get the fire going
again. We're all freezing.

533
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:24,575
Man: Aye. We need you in the journey.
Boy: I promise I'll do it.

534
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:26,559
Man: I've got to have a piss.

535
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,276
(Pigs grunting)

536
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:38,905
(Women whimpering)

537
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,408
Now keep quiet.

538
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,461
(Rattles)

539
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,476
(Lantern squeaking)

540
00:37:20,405 --> 00:37:21,823
(Coughing)

541
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,325
You need water.

542
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,077
It doesn't matter.

543
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:28,997
Of course it matters.

544
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,252
You mustn't let anything stop you.

545
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,715
They already have stopped me.

546
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,930
You're not here.

547
00:37:52,103 --> 00:37:54,314
You're far from here.

548
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:57,484
What does that mean?

549
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:00,862
(Crows cawing)

550
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:06,451
At the hill.

551
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,204
A great weinnood tree.

552
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:13,958
You've seen it, too.

553
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:15,460
Meera and I,

554
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:17,462
even hodor,

555
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:20,799
we're only here to guide you.

556
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,554
He's waiting for you.

557
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,391
We have to find it.

558
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:34,229
You have to make it.

559
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,731
We will.

560
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:40,360
This isn't the end.

561
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:43,822
Not for you.

562
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,741
Not yet.

563
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,244
Meera: How...

564
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,788
Will we know the end?

565
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:05,927
You'll know.

566
00:39:08,930 --> 00:39:11,391
(Footsteps)

567
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:20,441
Locke: Brothers.

568
00:39:21,943 --> 00:39:23,611
You do move quiet.

569
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:28,199
- How many?
- Eleven men.

570
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,118
Most of them already drunk.

571
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:33,788
No guards posted. They don't
seem to have a care in the world.

572
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:36,875
We'll carve them up like walnut pie.

573
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:40,128
Karl was the top paid cutthroat
in flea bottom.

574
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,689
I've seen what he can do with a knife.

575
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:43,673
Have you seen what I can do with a knife?

576
00:39:43,882 --> 00:39:45,967
(Chuckles) Not yet.

577
00:39:48,678 --> 00:39:52,056
There's a hut on the West Side of the keep.
We should steer clear of it.

578
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:56,728
They've got some hounds chained up inside.

579
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:59,147
Closer we can get without
the dogs sniffing us, the better.

580
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,067
New moon tonight.

581
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:08,531
(Sighs) Get some rest.

582
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:10,158
We move at sundown.

583
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:14,704
I've always liked a girl with curls.

584
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:16,623
A touch of class.

585
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:19,083
You take whatever's left.

586
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:23,588
Get her up.

587
00:40:25,715 --> 00:40:27,216
Bran: Stop.

588
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,105
- Stop. What are you doing?
- Hodor: Hodor.

589
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:31,971
- Hodor.
- Stop.

590
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,098
Stop!

591
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:36,142
Hodor: Hodor. Bran: Stop!

592
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,311
(Meera grunting)

593
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:41,022
- Please.
- Hodor.

594
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:44,067
- Please, get off her!
- Hodor.

595
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,402
Please, leave her alone!

596
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,824
Bran: Please, stop. Stop.

597
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:54,911
- What are you doing? Leave her alone!
- Hodor.

598
00:40:56,913 --> 00:40:59,916
- Shh, shh, shh.
- (Whimpering)

599
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:02,710
Shh.

600
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:08,049
You've got pretty hair, don't you?

601
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:13,221
Now what is
a pretty little highborn girl like you

602
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:16,307
doing out here in the deep, dark woods, eh?

603
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:21,646
You left your daddy's castle
looking for trouble, didn't you?

604
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:23,856
No dresses for you.

605
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,402
You like it rough, don't you?

606
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,780
You like it in the gutter, don't you?

607
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:34,158
If you let my sister go, I can help you.

608
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:38,579
- You can help me?
- I can.

609
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:43,501
And how you gonna do that?

610
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:50,133
I have the sight. I can see things.

611
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,176
That's very helpful.

612
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,220
Things that haven't happened yet.

613
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:00,309
What a fine thing.

614
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:05,064
A fine thing.

615
00:42:07,275 --> 00:42:10,111
Have you seen
what I'm gonna do to your sister?

616
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:16,659
What they're going to do?

617
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:25,460
Don't close your eyes.

618
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,300
I saw you die tonight.

619
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:37,680
I saw your body burn.

620
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:41,976
I saw the snowfall and Bury your bones.

621
00:42:45,188 --> 00:42:46,731
Man: To arms!

622
00:42:47,774 --> 00:42:50,068
They're here, the night's watch.

623
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:53,404
(Men shouting)

624
00:42:58,785 --> 00:43:00,995
(Woman screaming)

625
00:43:03,164 --> 00:43:04,707
(Grunting)

626
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,302
(Man screams)

627
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:22,183
Rescue party is here, lads.

628
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:23,768
Lady.

629
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:26,395
- Is Jon with you?
- Aye.

630
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:29,023
I'll take you to him.

631
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:34,403
You're Brandon stark?

632
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:40,910
- (Gasps)
- Hodor.

633
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:43,621
The little crippled lord.
We're going for a ride, boy.

634
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:48,751
Keep talking and I'll
cut your friends' throats.

635
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:51,254
Starting with the idiot.

636
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:54,799
Do you hear?

637
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,564
Hodor: Hodor!

638
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:12,525
Hodor

639
00:44:13,276 --> 00:44:15,069
hodor

640
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:20,366
hodor

641
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:30,168
(Grunting)

642
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:51,772
(Choking)

643
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:00,156
(Neck snaps)

644
00:45:03,326 --> 00:45:05,203
Hodor

645
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:10,124
hodor, get his knife. Cut me loose.

646
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:14,253
- Hodor, get his knife.
- Hodor.

647
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:16,839
Cut me loose, hodor.

648
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:26,974
Jojen and meera, free them.

649
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:31,854
- (Swords clanking)
- (Men shouting)

650
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:32,980
Jon.

651
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:48,579
If he sees you, he won't let you go north.

652
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:51,582
- He's my brother.
- And wants to protect you.

653
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:53,793
He'll take you back to castle black.

654
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,556
Man: They're coming from that way as well!

655
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:57,755
You have to decide.

656
00:45:58,047 --> 00:45:59,924
Do you want to find the three-eyed raven?

657
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:17,108
Bran: Hodor. Hodor: Hodor.

658
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,693
We need to free summer.

659
00:46:19,527 --> 00:46:21,445
And we need to go.

660
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:28,077
(Shouts) (Groans)

661
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,962
Lord snow.

662
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:40,298
Are you bringing me back for trial?

663
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,552
We had a good thing here.

664
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:48,139
We were free men.

665
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:50,474
You'll never be free.

666
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:52,810
You'll never know what that's like.

667
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:16,584
You learn how to fight in a castle?

668
00:47:20,129 --> 00:47:21,964
(Groans)

669
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:24,008
Some old man teach you how to stand,

670
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:25,426
how to parry?

671
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:26,886
(Groans)

672
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,557
How to fight with honour?

673
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:46,572
You know what's wrong with honour?

674
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:47,656
(Spits)

675
00:47:53,329 --> 00:47:54,747
(Grunts)

676
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,001
You.

677
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,715
(Woman whimpering)

678
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,680
(Gurgung)

679
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:22,775
(Panting)

680
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:32,451
Are you all right?

681
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:37,623
Come with me.

682
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:39,750
Come on.

683
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:46,215
(Grunts)

684
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:58,686
We lost four brothers?

685
00:48:59,395 --> 00:49:00,479
Five.

686
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,610
What the seven hells
could do that to a man?

687
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:11,031
I count 10 dead mutineers.

688
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:14,410
Locke said there were 11 of them.

689
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:17,121
Where's rast?

690
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:20,207
(Wind howling)

691
00:49:23,544 --> 00:49:25,713
(Panting)

692
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,440
(Crows cawing)

693
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,742
- (Roaring)
- (Rast screams)

694
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:03,584
- Here's another.
- Jon.

695
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:08,589
Jon: Where in seven hells?

696
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:11,133
Come here.

697
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:20,935
I missed you, boy.

698
00:50:24,522 --> 00:50:26,357
What should we do with this lot?

699
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:34,281
It's not safe for you here on your own.

700
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:39,119
Mance rayder has an army heading this way
and there's worse out there than mance.

701
00:50:41,247 --> 00:50:44,250
Come with us to castle black.

702
00:50:44,333 --> 00:50:46,961
We can find you work. Keep you safe.

703
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,713
Meaning all respect, ser crow,

704
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:52,841
craster beat us and worse.

705
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:56,178
Your brother crows beat us and worse.

706
00:50:56,345 --> 00:50:58,222
We'll find our own way.

707
00:50:58,305 --> 00:50:59,974
You want to stay here?

708
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:02,059
In craster's keep?

709
