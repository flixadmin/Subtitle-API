1
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:42,251
<i>Before Rome, before Babylon,</i>

2
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:45,045
<i>before the pyramids, there was Kahndaq.</i>

3
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:54,680
<i>The first self-governing people on Earth,</i>

4
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:57,140
<i>Kahndaq was a center of power
and enlightenment.</i>

5
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,851
<i>For centuries, they thrived.</i>

6
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,818
<i>But then,</i>

7
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,948
<i>came King Ahk-Ton.</i>

8
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:17,661
<i>Using the army to seize power,
Ahk-Ton became a tyrant.</i>

9
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,955
<i>But he had even darker ambitions.</i>

10
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,256
<i>Obsessed with dark magic,</i>

11
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:33,677
<i>Ahk-Ton's real goal
was to forge the Crown of Sabbac.</i>

12
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,891
<i>If infused with the powers
of the six demons</i>

13
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:42,269
<i>of the ancient world,</i>

14
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,479
<i>it would make Ahk-Ton invincible.</i>

15
00:01:45,314 --> 00:01:47,232
<i>To make the crown, he needed Eternium.</i>

16
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:48,942
<i>A rare mineral of magic properties</i>

17
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:51,236
<i>found only in Kahndaq.</i>

18
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,322
<i>So he enslaved his own people</i>

19
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,825
<i>and forced them to dig.</i>

20
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:11,214
Eternium.

21
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:17,971
Eternium.

22
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,097
Eternium.

23
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:20,557
Eternium.

24
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,709
<i>Kahndaq was teetering on the brink.</i>

25
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,861
<i>What they needed...</i>

26
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:33,904
Get off him!

27
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:34,988
Get off him!

28
00:02:35,447 --> 00:02:37,115
Get off him!

29
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,826
<i>Was a hero.</i>

30
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:43,038
Why are we fighting each other?

31
00:02:43,372 --> 00:02:44,873
Remember who our real enemy is!

32
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:46,458
Come with me.

33
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:49,711
Look!

34
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:50,795
Eternium.

35
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,006
Let me see that.

36
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,389
The king thanks you.

37
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,426
He's supposed to reward him.

38
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:03,891
Is that right?

39
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,519
I want what I'm owed.

40
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,609
You want a reward?

41
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,489
The king thanks you for your service.

42
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,500
You want the king's reward, too?

43
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:33,797
No, but my son accepts the king's mercy.

44
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,847
I won't always be here to protect you.

45
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,682
I don't need protection.

46
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,225
I want to be free.

47
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,103
If we fight together,
we could overthrow the king.

48
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,604
Let someone else be the hero.

49
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:51,815
The graveyards are full of them.

50
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:55,026
Stop dreaming and go back to work.

51
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,825
<i>Someone to hold the hopes of the people,</i>

52
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:06,997
<i>even when all hope seems lost.</i>

53
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,459
If we had more heroes,

54
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:14,171
then maybe our freedom
wouldn't be a dream.

55
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:18,550
Freedom!

56
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,633
Freedom!

57
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,760
<i>King Ahk-Ton knew that this spark</i>

58
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,327
<i>could quickly ignite a fire.</i>

59
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,121
<i>And so, he ordered that it be snuffed out.</i>

60
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,002
<i>They thought they were getting a martyr.</i>

61
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,214
<i>Instead,</i>

62
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,633
<i>they got a miracle.</i>

63
00:05:09,184 --> 00:05:10,544
<i>The Council of Wizards,</i>

64
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:12,437
<i>the magical guardians of the earth...</i>

65
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,648
You have been chosen.

66
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:15,958
<i>Sought to restore the balance.</i>

67
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,252
<i>They empowered him with the gifts</i>

68
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,754
<i>of the ancient gods.</i>

69
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:20,695
<i>And turned a boy</i>

70
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,461
<i>into a champion.</i>

71
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:25,951
Shazam!

72
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,287
Hurry.

73
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:30,205
Give it to me!

74
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,058
<i>But the crown had already been completed.</i>

75
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,082
Give it to me!

76
00:05:35,627 --> 00:05:37,021
<i>And when the Champion
arrived at the palace</i>

77
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,213
<i>to challenge him,</i>

78
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:41,967
<i>King Ahk-Ton summoned its demonic power.</i>

79
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:49,808
<i>In the ensuing battle,
the palace was destroyed,</i>

80
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:52,018
<i>but the Champion was victorious.</i>

81
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,129
<i>The wizards hid the Crown of Sabbac</i>

82
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,690
<i>so that it would never again
fall into the hands of man.</i>

83
00:05:57,816 --> 00:06:00,527
<i>And the Champion
was never heard from again.</i>

84
00:06:06,241 --> 00:06:08,869
<i>Today, Kahndaq is occupied
by international mercenaries,</i>

85
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:12,372
<i>the Intergang, the latest
in a series of foreign invaders.</i>

86
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,544
<i>But legend says,
whenever Kahndaq needs him most,</i>

87
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:21,590
<i>the Champion will return
to restore freedom to the people.</i>

88
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:23,925
<i>It has been a long, long wait.</i>

89
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,474
Hey!

90
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:38,815
Show me your papers.

91
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,696
Move it along!

92
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,424
Have your documentation ready.

93
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,469
It's all our three documents, yeah?

94
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:51,703
Don't judge the picture,

95
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,426
it's after my girlfriend broke up with me.

96
00:06:58,877 --> 00:07:01,046
Open the back. Need a look inside.

97
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,760
Yeah, it's unlocked, man.

98
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,222
It's just a bunch of old TVs.
I'm an electrician.

99
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:19,689
Hey!

100
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:21,691
Watch where you're going.

101
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:23,568
You know the drill, back of the line.

102
00:07:23,652 --> 00:07:25,904
Come on, man, you see me every day.

103
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,214
And every day I tell ya,

104
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,949
if it's got wheels, it's a vehicle.

105
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:30,492
Back of the line, mate.

106
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,160
You're not my mate.

107
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,705
I'm heartbroken. Now, go on, piss off.

108
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:39,292
No, what you are
is a neo-imperialist enforcer,

109
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:41,211
from halfway around the world,

110
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,380
sent here to steal
my country's natural resources,

111
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,174
strip-mine our sacred lands,
pollute our water,

112
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:47,592
oppress our heritage,

113
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:49,427
and make us wait in lines all day.

114
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:55,058
Hey, boss man. Can I go?

115
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,649
Go on, get out of here.

116
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,484
Yeah, yeah.

117
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,536
Adrianna, we're clear.

118
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,045
Kahndaq isn't safe for us anymore.

119
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:25,606
Let's just move the crown first,

120
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,899
and then we can worry about safe.

121
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,758
I got Intergang watching my house.

122
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,343
I gave up my job at the university

123
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:31,636
and moved four times.

124
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,406
It doesn't mean
I'm gonna abandon my country.

125
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,266
I'm just saying, no one stays
a step ahead of them forever.

126
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,518
We can't wait for things
to cool down this time.

127
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,563
If I'm right,
they're days away from finding it.

128
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,235
What are you doing?

129
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,778
I want to come with you.

130
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:49,988
You know it's too dangerous.

131
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:51,740
You shouldn't have gotten involved.

132
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:54,451
Come on, I want to help you
beat those bastards.

133
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,369
Adrianna, keep your head down, please.

134
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,288
- You want to be a hero, huh?
- I do, yeah.

135
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,248
Go home, do your homework.

136
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:04,002
Your time will come one day,
but not today, son.

137
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,380
Go, little man. You did good.

138
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:40,580
That would get you a fortune
on the black market.

139
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,499
Is that real Eternium?

140
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,418
Show us a little magic.

141
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:47,670
It doesn't work like that, it's unrefined.

142
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:48,954
You guys should get some rest.

143
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,424
I thought Intergang
seized all the old relics.

144
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:52,508
Hey, come on. Stop it.

145
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,968
I'm just curious how she got it.

146
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:55,804
My grandmother gave it to me.

147
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:56,805
How did she get it?

148
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:58,723
It's not a museum piece.

149
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,434
It's a family heirloom,
going all the way back

150
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,978
to the days when Kahndaq was free.

151
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:05,480
You happy now?

152
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,065
Cool story.

153
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,946
And all I inherited was a sweater.

154
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,573
That's not true.
<i>Baba</i> left you his van and his bald spot.

155
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:17,367
You know, some women like a bald spot.

156
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,453
Curly on the outside,
smooth on the inside. You know?

157
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,729
Are you sure about this?

158
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,582
The inscriptions we found are clear.

159
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,359
And I'm positive about that translation.

160
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,361
There is something inside that mountain.

161
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,244
What if it really is the crown? Then what?

162
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,369
It's a source of great power.
Who gets to keep it?

163
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,330
No one. We hide it again some place else.

164
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:06,332
Get it out of the country if we have to.

165
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:08,751
It is too dangerous for anyone to have.

166
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,504
This is it?

167
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,590
Not yet.

168
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,428
- Are you coming?
- Eh, bad knee. I'll keep watch.

169
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,575
This way. Almost there.

170
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,667
"Men were given the gift of magic,

171
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:53,213
but their hearts
were too easily corrupted."

172
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:58,467
Keep reading.

173
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:01,512
"The ultimate power
was banished from the earth

174
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,806
and hidden here."

175
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,101
Until now.

176
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:09,038
This mountain has kept
the Crown of Sabbac safe

177
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,313
for 5,000 years.

178
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,900
We're 100 percent,
totally, like, no take-backs

179
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,110
certain that we want to move it?

180
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:17,737
We don't have a choice.

181
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,406
What happened to Ishmael?

182
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:25,161
Great. Don't worry, I'll find him.

183
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,793
<i>Baby, come back</i>

184
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:36,089
<i>Oh, baby... On me</i>

185
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,924
<i>I was wrong</i>

186
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,468
<i>And I just can't live without you</i>

187
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:44,013
<i>Baby, come back</i>

188
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,183
Samir?

189
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,398
Samir, what happened?

190
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,400
What?

191
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:57,819
I can't hear you. What are you saying?

192
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,699
Don't move!
Unless you want to join your mate.

193
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:05,222
Stay where you are!

194
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,162
Oh, hey. Oh, hey. Hey.

195
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:13,945
"Turn back."

196
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,131
That's what it says, no?

197
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:19,299
Yes.

198
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,259
Where is Samir?

199
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:25,096
Claustrophobic. Needed some air.

200
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,765
- Is this the way to the crown?
- I think so.

201
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,865
It's a tomb.

202
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,080
"Speak not his power,

203
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:54,083
so he may suffer a dreamless sleep

204
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,918
for all eternity." Teth Adam.

205
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:59,213
The slave who became champion
and defeated the king.

206
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:00,465
The legend was true.

207
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:04,844
Kahndaq really did have a hero once.

208
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:08,097
If he was such a hero,
why'd they Bury him down here?

209
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,915
The crown.

210
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,669
It's over.

211
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,255
Now, give me the crown.

212
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,840
Run, Addy! Run!

213
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,779
Hold fire!

214
00:15:28,803 --> 00:15:31,305
Don't hit the crown! Get her!

215
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,828
- Go! Move.
- Circle around!

216
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:37,854
Get down!

217
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:45,987
Say goodbye to your brother.

218
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,405
In five,

219
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:49,740
four,

220
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:50,824
three,

221
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,577
two,

222
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:54,370
one...

223
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:55,663
I'm over here.

224
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,417
One? You let them get to one?

225
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:17,894
Any last words?

226
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,398
Please tell my son...

227
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,862
"Mightiest of mortals,

228
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,448
God of gods,

229
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:32,283
Six Immortal Elders by name."

230
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:33,367
What?

231
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:35,786
"Shazam!"

232
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,132
Who the hell is that?

233
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,885
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

234
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:10,363
Check him out.

235
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:11,906
Boss say you go.

236
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,574
Chief say your turn.

237
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:28,673
Hey, <i>amigo.</i> Let me see your hands.

238
00:17:53,281 --> 00:17:54,865
Open fire!

239
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,581
Your magic is weak.

240
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,464
Go. Go.

241
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:39,910
We need immediate backup!
Send everything you've got!

242
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:53,758
Ishmael!

243
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,226
Ishmael!

244
00:19:30,086 --> 00:19:31,128
Let's go!

245
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:32,922
This is as fast as I can go.

246
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:04,036
Samir! What happened?

247
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,163
What didn't happen!

248
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:07,873
Samir fell off of a cliff.

249
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:09,834
I had a gun to my head.

250
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,753
Ishmael is buried under a mountain.

251
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,048
And you summoned some flying magic man.

252
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:18,175
All for what? Nothing!

253
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,595
- Oh.
- Not for nothing.

254
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:40,865
Light him up.

255
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,671
Shit! Where the hell did he come from?

256
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:56,797
Rotor out! Go! Go!

257
00:20:58,716 --> 00:21:00,634
I can't maintain altitude!

258
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:29,931
Oh, shit.

259
00:22:36,522 --> 00:22:37,731
Stop! Stop the van!

260
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,853
Behind you!

261
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,524
Did he just catch a rocket?

262
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:58,479
God willing, we won't see him again.

263
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,953
Wait. Hey! Hey! What are you doing?

264
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:15,621
Don't touch him, he's made of lightning.

265
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:17,998
Good point.

266
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:19,792
You get him, you're the electrician.

267
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:28,926
Raptor team, come in.

268
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,010
<i>What's your status?</i>

269
00:24:33,347 --> 00:24:34,974
Help me.

270
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:38,894
I told you to make it look real,
not punch me in the face.

271
00:24:41,939 --> 00:24:43,375
<i>Raptor team, come in.</i>

272
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:44,775
<i>What's your status?</i>

273
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,027
Status is that everyone is dead.

274
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:49,488
Ishmael, is that you? What happened?

275
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:53,575
The crown wasn't the only thing
waiting for us down here.

276
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,119
- Do you have it?
- <i>No.</i>

277
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:56,912
But I know who does.

278
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,289
Copy that.
We're en route to your location.

279
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:02,852
<i>We need immediate backup.</i>

280
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,128
<i>Send everything you've got!</i>

281
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,480
<i>This rare, magical mineral</i>

282
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,089
<i>has been mined for centuries...</i>

283
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:08,942
<i>reports of an Eternium blast.</i>

284
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:10,217
<i>It is unknown who or why...</i>

285
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,153
<i>decimated a number of troops.</i>

286
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,887
<i>An unidentified male.</i>

287
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:15,764
<i>This being is somehow able to harness...</i>

288
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:17,182
<i>What do you think?</i>

289
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:19,977
I think this loose cannon
needs to be locked down

290
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,021
before innocent people start getting hurt.

291
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:23,981
Oh, and good morning to you, too.

292
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,315
<i>Shove it up your ass, Carter.</i>

293
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:28,444
<i>He's been asleep for 5,000 years.</i>

294
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,905
<i>He'll be disoriented at first.
The longer he has to adapt,</i>

295
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:34,116
<i>the harder it will be to take him down.</i>

296
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:36,702
Wheels up in 30.

297
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,037
<i>Who's on the team?</i>

298
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,673
<i>Welcome.</i>

299
00:25:49,757 --> 00:25:51,508
<i>Please state your name for identification.</i>

300
00:25:51,592 --> 00:25:55,095
Uh, hi. I'm Maxine hunkel.
I'm here to see Mr. Hall.

301
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:56,847
<i>Confirmed. Welcome, Maxine.</i>

302
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:57,973
Thanks!

303
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:00,517
<i>Maxine Hunkel, AKA Cyclone.</i>

304
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:04,354
<i>Wind manipulation powers,
computer skills, smart as hell.</i>

305
00:26:04,438 --> 00:26:08,233
<i>Basically a tornado with a 167 IQ.</i>

306
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:09,693
<i>Sounds delightful.</i>

307
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:11,904
<i>But please tell me you found someone</i>

308
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,489
<i>who can pack a punch.</i>

309
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,574
That's where Atom Smasher comes in.

310
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:18,952
Al Rothstein,
nephew to the original Atom Smasher.

311
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:21,036
Inherited his uncle's powers.

312
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,541
- <i>How's my suit? Does it fit?</i>
- No, yeah. It's perfect.

313
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:26,144
Thank you again for letting me borrow it.

314
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:28,253
You know, I used to watch you
all the time as a kid?

315
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:30,774
This is literally the only thing
that I'd ever wanted in my...

316
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:32,883
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Don't let anything happen to it.</i>

317
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:33,967
<i>It's vintage.</i>

318
00:26:34,051 --> 00:26:35,445
<i>And don't let anything
happen to you, either.</i>

319
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:37,596
<i>Don't do anything crazy.
You listen to Carter.</i>

320
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,890
I'm gonna make you proud, Uncle Al.
I promise.

321
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,811
<i>They seem green.</i>

322
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:45,521
That's why I called in Kent.

323
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:50,067
<i>Kent's been out of action
for a little while,</i>

324
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,069
<i>but I can't do this without him.</i>

325
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,404
<i>Takes magic to fight magic
and the man's got</i>

326
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:56,573
<i>nearly God-level powers.</i>

327
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:04,039
<i>It might take a lot more than that.</i>

328
00:27:04,123 --> 00:27:06,166
<i>Are you sure they can take him?</i>

329
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,585
Waller, you find us a cell
that can hold him,

330
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:10,796
we'll take care of the rest.

331
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,171
<i>Good luck.</i>

332
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:20,180
This is gonna be fun.

333
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,823
We're here, sir.

334
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:38,906
Oh, right.

335
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:44,538
Was I staring again?

336
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,290
Only half an hour or so, sir.

337
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,042
Maybe next time, honk the horn?

338
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:50,460
Of course, sir.

339
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:06,894
So, what's the op?

340
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:09,479
We're headed to Kahndaq
to apprehend and contain

341
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:11,315
a Class-A rogue metahuman.

342
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,458
I didn't bring a passport.

343
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:17,112
We don't need passports.
We're the Justice Society.

344
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:26,914
Is this entirely made out of Nth metal?

345
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:29,291
Everything down to the screws.

346
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,043
Completely indestructible.

347
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,129
I'll be in the cockpit if you need me.

348
00:28:36,006 --> 00:28:38,091
It's pretty cool. You got any snacks?

349
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:42,721
It takes a lot of energy to smash atoms.

350
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:57,235
Here.

351
00:28:58,028 --> 00:28:59,279
Oh! Thanks.

352
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,574
I'm Al, by the way.

353
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:04,034
Maxine.

354
00:29:09,957 --> 00:29:10,999
What do you do?

355
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,626
Wind. You?

356
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,126
I grow.

357
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:16,128
Cool.

358
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:02,676
Don't worry about that.
I can get another one.

359
00:30:06,722 --> 00:30:08,515
My mom's not much of a doctor,

360
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:10,058
but you should probably leave...

361
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,603
Or do that.

362
00:30:17,566 --> 00:30:19,234
I know you have a lot to catch up on.

363
00:30:19,318 --> 00:30:21,320
But I was thinking
we could help each other.

364
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:23,572
- Move.
- I'm Amon, by the way.

365
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,198
I didn't ask for your name.

366
00:30:25,282 --> 00:30:26,450
You're Teth Adam, right?

367
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:28,201
Everyone in Kahndaq knows your story.

368
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:30,037
- I said, move.
- My mom said you took out

369
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,840
a bunch of Intergang soldiers
in the desert.

370
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,433
Because they wouldn't move out of my way.

371
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:34,977
So you can really fly and stop bullets,

372
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:36,602
'cause that's really crucial to my plan.

373
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:38,396
And is it really you stopping the bullets,
or is it the suit?

374
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,338
Wait, what's your top speed?

375
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:40,648
I'm sure you're fast, but how fast?

376
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:41,672
Like Flash fast?

377
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,849
Wait, did you really not
have mirrors back then?

378
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,853
Wow, I guess a lot does change
in 5,000 years.

379
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,274
Five thousand years?

380
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:00,877
Yeah, that's how long
you were in the tomb.

381
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:02,736
Until my mom woke you up.

382
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:05,322
So, you've got stopping bullets, check.
Flying, check.

383
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,115
And lightning thing, that's a big check.

384
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,414
I don't know this place.

385
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,083
This is your home.

386
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:21,838
Then my home is gone.

387
00:31:37,229 --> 00:31:38,355
What happened to the crown?

388
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:41,024
Too much?

389
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:46,486
You know it's cursed with demons, right?

390
00:31:56,957 --> 00:32:01,420
"Life is the only path to death."

391
00:32:02,671 --> 00:32:04,005
No shit.

392
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:11,012
"Teth Adam was a Bronze Age
Kahndaqi demi-god.

393
00:32:11,096 --> 00:32:14,683
He defeated King Ahk-Ton
in approximately 2,600 BC."

394
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,768
There. That's you. See?

395
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:18,079
That's the statue they built of you.

396
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:18,937
And now you're back.

397
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,273
Our country's been oppressed
by one invader after another

398
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:22,691
ever since you left.

399
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:26,319
My point is, Kahndaq still isn't free.

400
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:28,864
We could really use a superhero
right about now.

401
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:31,158
I'm no hero.

402
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,827
What? Superman, Batman, Aquaman...

403
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,829
You're way more stacked than any of them.

404
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:38,206
And they're not coming
to Kahndaq to save us.

405
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,417
But you could stop Intergang
all by yourself,

406
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,793
just like you did King Ahk-Ton.

407
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:43,295
You're our only hope.

408
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:09,571
Wizards.

409
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,490
I can fix it. Don't worry.

410
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:15,619
I'm not a wizard.

411
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:19,247
Hey, Mom. He's awake.

412
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:22,042
I told you not to go in your room.

413
00:33:22,751 --> 00:33:23,919
It was you who spoke.

414
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:27,214
You woke me.

415
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:30,425
I didn't have a choice.
I'd be dead if it hadn't worked.

416
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,260
The men in my tomb,
they were your enemies?

417
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:33,053
Yes.

418
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,596
Then your enemies are vanquished,

419
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,515
condemned to the eternal sleep
of the damned.

420
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:39,184
Actually, we still have a lot of enemies
that need vanquishing.

421
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,018
Then destroy them.

422
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:43,146
Intergang have guns and flybikes
and Eternium rockets.

423
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:45,023
We have my mom.

424
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,025
Prove your strength.

425
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,985
Destroy your enemy and all he cares about.

426
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:50,445
Make him beg for mercy,

427
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:52,405
but deny it until his final breath.

428
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,199
Interesting, okay?

429
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,951
I appreciate what you did for me,

430
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:59,162
but I do not want you
teaching my son violence.

431
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,749
I understand. You want his father

432
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,192
to teach him violence.

433
00:34:04,251 --> 00:34:06,091
- Gross, that's my brother.
- That's my sister.

434
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,296
- His father's dead.
- I'm sorry.

435
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,436
Who do you want
to teach him violence then?

436
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,094
Yeah, Mom.
Who do you want to teach me violence?

437
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,220
No one.

438
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:20,058
I want a champion to help
free Kahndaq from Intergang.

439
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,644
Please, help us.

440
00:34:40,829 --> 00:34:41,955
Wait! Wait.

441
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:45,792
- Where are you going?
- I shouldn't be here.

442
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,295
You don't feel any loyalty to us at all?

443
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:49,588
Not really, no.

444
00:34:49,671 --> 00:34:51,506
You're not seeing
the full possibilities here.

445
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:53,109
I don't know what it was like
in ancient times,

446
00:34:53,133 --> 00:34:55,760
but having superpowers
is kind of a big deal in our world.

447
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:57,404
Maybe clean up your outfit a little bit,

448
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:58,638
get a cape, change your name.

449
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:00,515
Teth Adam is a very strong name.

450
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:01,600
It's a little outdated.

451
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:03,226
And you definitely need a catchphrase.

452
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,020
Something blackout bad-ass to say

453
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,272
right before you absolutely
cook some dude.

454
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,773
I don't waste words on the dead.

455
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:10,543
Well, yeah, kind of like that,
but more catchy.

456
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:11,818
I was thinking, like,

457
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,154
"Tell them the Man in Black sent you."

458
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:15,739
- Them?
- You know, gods, demons...

459
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,258
Whoever's waiting for us in the afterlife.

460
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:19,802
And you wear a lot of black,
so we should really lean into that.

461
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:22,078
My point is, you could be famous.

462
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:24,497
Magazines, lunch boxes, video games.

463
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:27,208
And the superhero industrial complex
is worth a lot of money.

464
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:29,294
I don't need a box for my lunch.

465
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,338
Anyone you've ever known is dead.

466
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:36,134
What else are you gonna do?

467
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,641
Wait! Where are you going?

468
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:01,076
Waller's file needs a bit to be desired.

469
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,827
Most of this was considered a myth

470
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:04,704
until yesterday afternoon.

471
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:07,624
He's a bad man, Kent.
What else do you need to know?

472
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:10,204
When you've seen as many
different futures as I have,

473
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,212
you cease to believe in absolutes.

474
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:15,548
What are you laughing at?

475
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,802
I'm not laughing. That was a smirk.

476
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,221
I know. That's how you laugh.

477
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:22,847
I've missed having you around

478
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:25,850
to spout old cryptic shit like that.

479
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:27,894
Almost as much as I've missed
having you around

480
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:30,605
to ignore all my advice. Carter,

481
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,900
this is not a very good plan.

482
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:39,364
Yeah, well,

483
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,784
a bad plan is better than no plan at all.

484
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,413
If only there were a third option.

485
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:52,001
I wouldn't touch that if I was you.

486
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:53,503
Why not?

487
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,630
'Cause that helmet is from another planet.

488
00:36:55,714 --> 00:36:57,006
It's millions of years old.

489
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,758
It chooses who it lets touch it.

490
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,594
- Like Kent?
- Yeah.

491
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:05,056
Like, Kent is literally possessed
when he puts it on.

492
00:37:05,515 --> 00:37:06,891
What happens if I touch it anyway?

493
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:10,186
Soul crushing terror? Or something.

494
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:13,106
So we should probably
put a towel on it, right?

495
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,357
Coming up on it.

496
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:16,818
Ready stations in five.

497
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:19,237
Hey, why is this Adam dude so pissed off?

498
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,530
He's not some dude.

499
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,949
He's a weapon of mass destruction.

500
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:25,368
You don't have to raise your hand.

501
00:37:25,452 --> 00:37:28,371
Question: If he's so powerful,
how are we supposed to stop him?

502
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:31,458
If we can get him
to say the word, "Shazam,"

503
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:33,626
Teth Adam will lose his power.

504
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,003
And we're hoping since he's had

505
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,422
a few thousand years to sleep it off,

506
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,842
we can peacefully negotiate
the terms of his existence.

507
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,945
From the footage you showed us,
he doesn't really seem like

508
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,971
a "peacefully negotiate" kind of guy.

509
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,264
Correct.

510
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,640
Look alive.

511
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,102
We're here.

512
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,437
Forgive me.

513
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:49,619
This is a message

514
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,055
- for all Intergang soldiers.
- Hey! Stop!

515
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:53,373
Kahndaq has its own
official superhero now.

516
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,606
Teth Adam!

517
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,068
Please.

518
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:25,780
There he is! Move!

519
00:39:25,864 --> 00:39:27,574
- Teth Adam!
- Move!

520
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,827
Teth Adam...

521
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:33,705
Get up! Who's gonna save you now, mate?

522
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,209
The statue?

523
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:41,045
That's my son.

524
00:39:41,129 --> 00:39:43,756
He's just a boy.
He doesn't know what he's doing.

525
00:39:44,841 --> 00:39:46,134
What are you doing?

526
00:39:46,759 --> 00:39:49,429
Hang on. I recognize you.

527
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,139
Where is the crown?

528
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,017
Let's go!

529
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:09,842
You could've showed up a bit sooner.

530
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:11,075
But that was dope.

531
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:17,624
We need backup down here.

532
00:40:58,748 --> 00:41:00,541
Tell them the Man in Black sent you.

533
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:03,544
Well, yes, but not to me.
Say it to the bad guys.

534
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,672
But before you zap them.

535
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:07,507
- Catchphrase, then kill.
- Yes.

536
00:41:30,238 --> 00:41:31,155
He's here.

537
00:41:31,239 --> 00:41:32,532
You sense his presence?

538
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:38,204
I assume he's the only person in Kahndaq
that can do that.

539
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:51,467
Fate and I'll take the lead. Listen.

540
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:53,970
Now, you two hang back 'til we call you.

541
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,596
We're the anvil, you're the hammer.

542
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,680
You're ready.

543
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,076
He just dropped the...

544
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,935
Shit!

545
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:08,234
Be prepared.

546
00:42:29,172 --> 00:42:30,298
Behind you!

547
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:45,354
Let us be!

548
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:48,858
I don't know their crimes,
but whatever they are,

549
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:51,486
these men should face due process.

550
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:56,824
Then let the gods make their judgment.

551
00:42:56,908 --> 00:42:58,284
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

552
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,286
You don't look like an Intergang.

553
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:02,705
We're the Justice Society.

554
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:05,833
Our mission is
to protect global stability.

555
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:09,212
We're here to restore peace to Kahndaq.

556
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:13,382
And we will use force if necessary.

557
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,011
Force is always necessary.

558
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:18,346
Teth Adam.

559
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:21,641
We know who you are
and what you are capable of.

560
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:25,603
There's no place for you
in the world of man.

561
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,022
You have two choices:

562
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:30,483
Kneel or die.

563
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:33,027
I was a slave until I died.

564
00:43:34,821 --> 00:43:36,697
Then I was reborn a god.

565
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,201
I kneel before no one.

566
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,335
Fate, give me a distraction.

567
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:45,308
Just say, "Shazam." We all go home.

568
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:49,061
I don't have a home.

569
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,430
Look at that suit. It's cool.

570
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:26,098
- Thanks. You, too.
- Thank you.

571
00:45:26,182 --> 00:45:28,309
It was a hand-me-down.
It was from my uncle.

572
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,752
Hawkman just does not give up, does he?

573
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:37,985
Nope.

574
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,917
Amon, where are you going? Wait!

575
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,168
To help him!

576
00:46:15,064 --> 00:46:17,608
Cyclone, Smasher, now is your time.

577
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:18,901
Let's roll!

578
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:20,963
What are you doing? Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

579
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:10,578
I'll be right there!

580
00:47:20,296 --> 00:47:22,089
You have the Crown of Sabbac.

581
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:07,426
I can't hold him much longer.

582
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:13,682
Move!

583
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,997
I'm coming!
I'm zeroing in on your location!

584
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:11,824
I got him! Guys, I got him.

585
00:49:12,408 --> 00:49:15,661
It's me, Al.
In case you didn't recognize me.

586
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:17,222
There's something different about you.

587
00:49:17,246 --> 00:49:18,515
Can't quite put my finger on it.

588
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:20,779
You know, it's probably because
I'm six stories tall now.

589
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:22,334
But you, you're like a tornado.

590
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:24,587
I thought the two of you did great work.

591
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:26,922
First time out. Bravo.

592
00:49:27,006 --> 00:49:29,425
Thanks. I mean, I got a little
turned around back there,

593
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:30,828
but it all worked out, right?

594
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:32,470
You're damn right it did.

595
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:34,722
Let's hope Waller has that cell
ready for him.

596
00:49:40,186 --> 00:49:42,771
You want me to keep my hand here, right?

597
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:44,398
You'd better not let him up.

598
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:48,944
What do I do? Guys?

599
00:50:05,628 --> 00:50:07,838
Long live the Champion!

600
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:10,341
Long live the Champion!

601
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:12,468
Long live the Champion!

602
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:14,762
Long live the Champion!

603
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:25,648
Yeah, he's definitely still breathing.

604
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:29,944
Long live the Champion!
Long live the Champion!

605
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:50,506
Where are you going?
We need to go after him.

606
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:52,049
We're not strong enough.

607
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:54,593
Oh, well, maybe next time
use your powers of prediction

608
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:57,096
to figure that out
before we get our asses kicked.

609
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,430
I'm working on it.

610
00:50:58,931 --> 00:50:59,931
Miss?

611
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:01,892
Excuse me, you mind if I look in your bag?

612
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:03,269
Yes, I do mind.

613
00:51:03,352 --> 00:51:04,770
Where are you going with this, Kent?

614
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,230
She's got the Crown of Sabbac.

615
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:08,023
One catastrophe at a time.

616
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:09,587
We can't give him a chance to regroup.

617
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:11,360
He's been spotted entering the palace.

618
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:13,654
It's safe to say
he's not going there to surrender.

619
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,447
Why do you want Teth Adam to surrender?

620
00:51:15,531 --> 00:51:17,491
He's the Champion of Kahndaq. Who are you?

621
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:18,909
The Justice Society?

622
00:51:19,535 --> 00:51:21,787
We have been living
under military occupation

623
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:24,498
for 27 years, and never seen you before.

624
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:27,209
You didn't come
when Intergang invaded our country,

625
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:29,878
when they stole our resources
and killed my husband.

626
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:32,339
But now, we finally have our own hero

627
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:35,801
and you decide to fly down here
and save us?

628
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:38,178
Thank you, but we're covered.

629
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:41,849
Go and protect international stability
some place else.

630
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:44,602
Oh, and second, I don't have the crown.

631
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:46,270
Let me spell it out for you.

632
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:48,647
Teth Adam can't be Kahndaq's champion

633
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:50,190
because he is not a hero.

634
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:51,609
Tell that

635
00:51:52,443 --> 00:51:55,654
to all the people he just liberated.

636
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:58,866
I know what this looks like. I do.

637
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,260
But I can assure you that my team...

638
00:52:03,746 --> 00:52:06,290
I am so sorry. Was that expensive?

639
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:10,294
Me and you.
When we get back to the ship...

640
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,212
- Yes, sir.
- Me and you.

641
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:16,258
Can we please just see the crown?

642
00:52:17,009 --> 00:52:18,135
I don't have it.

643
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:38,197
We don't have time for this.

644
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,282
Teth Adam first, then the crown.

645
00:52:40,366 --> 00:52:42,743
You don't have any authority here.

646
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:43,986
Teth Adam has done nothing...

647
00:52:44,036 --> 00:52:46,830
Teth Adam is not who you think he is.

648
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:48,332
And how would you know?

649
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:49,958
We have access to ancient texts

650
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:51,960
that have been kept secret for centuries.

651
00:52:52,044 --> 00:52:54,630
And what exactly do these
supposed ancient texts say?

652
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:57,925
They say that his rage
nearly destroyed Kahndaq.

653
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,469
And we flew all the way over here

654
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:02,805
to stop it from happening again.

655
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,410
You want to go in there alone?

656
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:08,435
Are you sure?

657
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:11,855
You want to fight Teth Adam again,
be my guest.

658
00:53:11,939 --> 00:53:14,274
But if you actually want
to resolve things peacefully,

659
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:16,443
without destroying the rest of my city,

660
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:17,986
I'm your only shot.

661
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:42,529
You brought the invaders with you.

662
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:44,096
They only want to talk.

663
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:48,142
They can talk. I won't listen.

664
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:52,396
When I was a little girl,
my grandmother told me the story

665
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:55,441
of how the Champion
came to this exact spot

666
00:53:55,524 --> 00:53:57,317
to free the enslaved people of Kahndaq

667
00:53:57,401 --> 00:53:59,486
by defeating King Ahk-Ton in battle.

668
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,530
But according to the Justice Society,

669
00:54:01,613 --> 00:54:02,948
that's not really what happened.

670
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:06,160
They say that you didn't come here
to seek justice.

671
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:09,913
Hurry.

672
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,247
Give it to me!

673
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:17,129
<i>That you came to exact revenge.</i>

674
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:34,605
<i>And in your anger...</i>

675
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:40,402
Don't kill me.
I can give you anything you want.

676
00:54:42,196 --> 00:54:44,114
This is what I want.

677
00:54:44,198 --> 00:54:46,825
<i>Your power grew
until it became uncontrollable.</i>

678
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:57,127
And the Council of Wizards
was forced to deem you unworthy

679
00:54:57,211 --> 00:54:58,879
<i>of the gifts that you were granted.</i>

680
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:01,465
We have chosen recklessly,

681
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:03,425
and humanity has paid the price.

682
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:05,427
And now, Teth Adam,

683
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:07,513
you must pay.

684
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,952
It wasn't your tomb that I opened, was it?

685
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:34,331
It was your prison.

686
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:37,543
And now, there's a statue of you.

687
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:41,797
Out of the hope that someday
Kahndaq's champion would return.

688
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,799
But it's built on a lie, isn't it?

689
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:45,884
I never said I was a hero.

690
00:55:45,968 --> 00:55:47,719
I never claimed to be anything.

691
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:50,514
You may not have been a hero.

692
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:53,350
But that doesn't mean
that you can't be one now.

693
00:56:00,816 --> 00:56:02,359
I will hear them out.

694
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:05,362
But if they choose to fight,
they choose to die.

695
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:11,451
Uncle Karim!

696
00:56:11,535 --> 00:56:13,304
I can't believe
you're sitting around watching TV

697
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:14,997
when the most epic day ever is...

698
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,374
In here, little man.

699
00:56:19,293 --> 00:56:21,545
Ishmael! My mom said
you got buried in the tomb.

700
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:22,880
Funny story, he didn't.

701
00:56:22,963 --> 00:56:25,132
Where's Adrianna?

702
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,341
She's back at the square...

703
00:56:26,425 --> 00:56:27,652
We should go bail her out right now.

704
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:28,778
But she's the one who sent me home

705
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:29,946
to make sure the crown's safe.

706
00:56:29,970 --> 00:56:31,638
It is safe, okay? Somewhere else.

707
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:34,224
- Definitely not here. Let...
- Okay.

708
00:56:34,308 --> 00:56:35,743
- Put the bag down.
- What are you doing?

709
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:38,395
Back away. Put the bag down, now.

710
00:56:41,857 --> 00:56:43,317
Give him the bag. Give him the bag.

711
00:56:45,152 --> 00:56:46,612
Very good. Back away.

712
00:56:47,571 --> 00:56:48,322
Back away.

713
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:49,865
Okay, I'm...

714
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:01,376
It's all going to be okay, little man.

715
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:03,670
Let me teach you some history
that you've never learned

716
00:57:03,754 --> 00:57:05,130
in one of your mother's classes.

717
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:06,882
When we had a powerful king,

718
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:10,260
Kahndaq used to be
something much better than free.

719
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:11,803
It used to be great.

720
00:57:11,887 --> 00:57:13,430
Run, Amon, run!

721
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:33,241
Crash the building.

722
00:57:33,325 --> 00:57:35,202
I lost the kid. He has the crown.

723
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,136
We're here to negotiate the terms

724
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:55,222
of your peaceful surrender.

725
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:59,184
I'm not peaceful. Nor do I surrender.

726
00:57:59,267 --> 00:58:01,311
What have your powers ever given to you?

727
00:58:01,395 --> 00:58:02,896
Nothing but heartache.

728
00:58:03,522 --> 00:58:04,648
You have no idea.

729
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,692
Then why are you making this hard on us?

730
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:08,902
We both know
you're not supposed to be here.

731
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:11,613
It is you who is not supposed to be here.

732
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:13,949
I want you all to leave Kahndaq
and never return.

733
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:17,369
Gladly, with you as our prisoner.

734
00:58:18,245 --> 00:58:20,497
How about I rip
your little wings off instead?

735
00:58:20,956 --> 00:58:22,332
I'd like to see you try.

736
00:58:22,416 --> 00:58:23,917
Okay, more fighting won't solve this.

737
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:25,502
- I disagree.
- Me, too.

738
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:27,045
Looks like we found common ground.

739
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:28,755
This can only end one way.

740
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:31,925
- <i>Mom?</i>
- Amon.

741
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:33,885
I got home and Ishmael was in the kitchen.

742
00:58:33,969 --> 00:58:35,012
Ishmael's dead.

743
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:37,222
No, he shot Uncle Karim,
and he's after the crown.

744
00:58:38,974 --> 00:58:39,808
Ground forces...

745
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:42,394
I'm hiding in our building,
and Intergang's here.

746
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:43,477
They're coming!

747
00:58:44,271 --> 00:58:45,856
Intergang are after my son.

748
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:49,151
They don't want him,
they want the Crown of Sabbac.

749
00:58:49,693 --> 00:58:50,819
I know you're not a hero.

750
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:52,182
But you're not a monster, either.

751
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:53,437
I don't care what anyone says.

752
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:55,365
You saved me in that cave.

753
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:58,326
You didn't know me
and your first instinct was to save me.

754
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:01,830
I'm begging you. Please, save my son.

755
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:07,270
Check the whole place clean.

756
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:09,171
Cover all access points!

757
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:11,923
Keep looking!

758
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:20,766
Area's clear.

759
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:22,934
There! Take him!

760
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,833
Right there, right there!

761
00:59:27,773 --> 00:59:28,982
Move, move!

762
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:30,609
Don't shoot him, I need him!

763
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:41,878
He's going down, he's going down!

764
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:50,837
End of the road, kid!

765
00:59:58,678 --> 00:59:59,554
Release the child.

766
00:59:59,638 --> 01:00:01,431
Whatever you say.

767
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:06,394
Yes! Thank you!

768
01:00:06,478 --> 01:00:09,272
But maybe be more careful
with your word choice next time.

769
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:14,653
Oh! And remember your catchphrase!

770
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:20,992
Time to go, Amon.

771
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,001
- Where's the crown?
- What crown?

772
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,838
- You want to be brave, eh?
- I want you to go to hell.

773
01:00:32,921 --> 01:00:34,297
That's the plan, little man.

774
01:00:34,381 --> 01:00:36,091
We're gonna go for a ride. Come on.

775
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:52,649
Put me down! Put me down!

776
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:55,402
You should be more careful
with your word choice next time.

777
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:57,070
And tell them that the Man in Black...

778
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:05,495
He's right behind me.
Where the hell is everybody?

779
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:16,673
Mom?

780
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:20,135
Amon, where are you? No, no, no. What?

781
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:21,469
I'm in one of their bikes.

782
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:23,013
What bikes?

783
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:43,199
Amon!

784
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:44,284
Can you hear me?

785
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:45,660
<i>Mom, I'm okay.</i>

786
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,250
Shit!

787
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:01,051
Activate infrared.

788
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:08,258
What are you doing?

789
01:02:08,475 --> 01:02:09,601
Searching for the child.

790
01:02:09,684 --> 01:02:10,977
No, you're murdering people.

791
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:12,395
How else do I find the child?

792
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:14,940
I can help you,
but no more extrajudicial killings.

793
01:02:15,023 --> 01:02:16,066
I don't need any help.

794
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:20,421
<i>Smasher, Cyclone!</i>

795
01:02:20,445 --> 01:02:21,988
<i>What are you waiting for?</i>

796
01:02:22,072 --> 01:02:24,157
- Come on, let's go!
- Okay.

797
01:02:24,241 --> 01:02:26,326
Okay. I got this. I got this.
On the count of three.

798
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:27,702
One, two...

799
01:02:27,786 --> 01:02:29,955
This feels a lot higher than last time.

800
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:33,792
Ah! That was not cool!

801
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:44,229
Hey.

802
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:45,845
Hey, guys. Slow down.

803
01:02:49,349 --> 01:02:51,643
I got you! I got you!

804
01:03:10,245 --> 01:03:13,373
Hey, careful, dude! I almost hit you.

805
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:20,273
I am so sorry.

806
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:21,816
I don't really have
peripheral vision in the mask.

807
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,967
It's my uncle's. I'll get it tailored.

808
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:25,302
Me and you.

809
01:03:25,677 --> 01:03:26,677
Roger that.

810
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:13,391
- Who are you?
- Call me Dr. Fate.

811
01:04:13,475 --> 01:04:16,311
How bad is it, Doc? Am I dying?

812
01:04:17,062 --> 01:04:18,605
I'm not that kind of doctor.

813
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:20,315
But don't worry, I can see the future.

814
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:22,442
This isn't how you're going to die.

815
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:23,777
How do I die, then?

816
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,570
Just stay away from electricity.

817
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:28,740
Wait, what? I'm an electrician.

818
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:30,533
How the hell am I supposed to do that?

819
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:38,977
Oh, God.

820
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:42,522
The Champion's coming for you.
You know that, right?

821
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:43,605
I'm counting on it.

822
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:56,953
Please don't.

823
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:58,788
<i>Teth Adam. Where are you?</i>

824
01:05:58,872 --> 01:05:59,872
You followed me?

825
01:06:00,081 --> 01:06:01,541
<i>My mind and body can exist</i>

826
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:03,710
<i>in different places at the same time.</i>

827
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:05,003
<i>Did you find the boy?</i>

828
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:07,022
Caught one of the bikes,
but he didn't have the child.

829
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:09,299
<i>Bring me the prisoner.
I'll break his mind.</i>

830
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:14,179
<i>You killed him, didn't you?</i>

831
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:22,729
He didn't make it.

832
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:26,417
The bullet's extracted.

833
01:06:26,441 --> 01:06:28,485
The tissue damage has been repaired.

834
01:06:28,568 --> 01:06:32,322
Blood pressure, 120 over 81.
Heart rate's at 74 bpm.

835
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:34,574
He'll be back on his feet in no time.

836
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:38,328
That is insane.

837
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:40,997
The nanobots did most of the work.

838
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,416
No, no, no.
I'm not gonna let you downplay this.

839
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,418
I literally just witnessed a miracle.

840
01:06:47,045 --> 01:06:48,205
What? I say something stupid?

841
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:51,591
No, it's just you can transform
your molecular structure,

842
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:53,218
grow a hundred times your own size.

843
01:06:53,301 --> 01:06:55,553
You're an impossibility
and the world still amazes you.

844
01:06:55,637 --> 01:06:57,263
I don't know,

845
01:06:58,056 --> 01:06:59,265
it's cool.

846
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:01,684
Thank you.

847
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,437
But it's not as cool as nanobots.

848
01:07:06,231 --> 01:07:08,316
That's how you do your wind thing.

849
01:07:08,399 --> 01:07:10,985
Well, the "wind thing"
is called aerokinesis.

850
01:07:11,069 --> 01:07:13,005
And the nanobots were injected
into my bloodstream

851
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,489
by this really messed-up scientist

852
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:15,990
who kidnapped me when I was 15.

853
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:22,163
I'm so sorry.

854
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:23,915
No, you're good.

855
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:26,084
It seems like you really turned it around.

856
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:27,961
Found your calling.

857
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:30,547
Hoping this is mine.

858
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:38,846
There's no point in dwelling in the past.

859
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:43,351
It's already moved on from you.

860
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:48,439
Why did you say that?

861
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:51,192
You were blaming yourself
for trusting Ishmael.

862
01:07:51,276 --> 01:07:54,404
Your thoughts are better spent
on the things you can change,

863
01:07:54,487 --> 01:07:56,072
not those you can't.

864
01:07:56,990 --> 01:07:58,270
You see the future?

865
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,660
Tell me how I get my son back.

866
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:03,204
By trusting us.

867
01:08:03,288 --> 01:08:06,040
Karim will live. We will save Amon.

868
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:08,167
It's what we do.

869
01:08:12,964 --> 01:08:15,341
I suppose they didn't have doors
in your day.

870
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:17,965
Well, of course we did.
That's how we entered rooms.

871
01:08:18,845 --> 01:08:20,847
What I did there is called sarcasm.

872
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:23,057
Where is Amon? Did you find him?

873
01:08:23,141 --> 01:08:24,183
Not yet, but I will.

874
01:08:24,267 --> 01:08:25,685
The men who took him will suffer.

875
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:29,147
Maybe these guys can help.

876
01:08:30,732 --> 01:08:33,067
There's an upside to keeping prisoners.

877
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:35,194
They can answer our questions.

878
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:36,571
What did you do with my son?

879
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:47,415
Adrianna. Adrianna.

880
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:49,500
I've learned that in this modern world,

881
01:08:49,584 --> 01:08:50,877
we shouldn't hurt our prisoners.

882
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,640
We should treat them
with dignity, respect.

883
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:55,340
No.

884
01:08:56,299 --> 01:08:58,051
Let's start with just one simple question.

885
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:00,303
Can either of you fly?

886
01:09:00,845 --> 01:09:02,597
Shit.

887
01:09:04,307 --> 01:09:06,309
I think I'll sit this one out.

888
01:09:13,024 --> 01:09:14,567
Tell me what you did with Amon.

889
01:09:15,777 --> 01:09:17,987
You'd better not drop those prisoners.

890
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:19,656
I'm not going to drop them.

891
01:09:21,532 --> 01:09:23,201
I'm going to drop one of them.

892
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:25,536
Whoever answers first lives. Where is he?

893
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:26,704
I don't know.

894
01:09:33,628 --> 01:09:35,296
He's at our mine in the desert.

895
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:36,881
I can show...

896
01:09:42,553 --> 01:09:44,681
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

897
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:48,032
You said you wouldn't hurt the prisoners.

898
01:09:48,393 --> 01:09:49,894
That was sarcasm.

899
01:09:50,269 --> 01:09:52,355
No, technically, it was just a lie.

900
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:53,832
Intergang have a mine in the desert.

901
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:55,108
- Amon is there.
- I know it.

902
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:57,402
It's near the Al Hadidiyah Mountains.

903
01:09:57,485 --> 01:09:58,485
Let's go.

904
01:10:00,071 --> 01:10:02,323
I told you, stop killing people!

905
01:10:02,407 --> 01:10:03,616
They look alive to me.

906
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:05,284
Because I saved them.

907
01:10:05,368 --> 01:10:07,012
Well, that's why I waited
until you were there.

908
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:09,956
I got the information I needed,
no one died.

909
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,082
I did it your way.

910
01:10:11,165 --> 01:10:12,750
He does have a point.

911
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:15,920
I know it got lost in all the confusion,

912
01:10:16,003 --> 01:10:18,339
but we still have some issues
to settle here.

913
01:10:18,423 --> 01:10:20,258
We know where Amon is. We have to go.

914
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:21,926
There is no "we" here.

915
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:25,513
There are only heroes
and there are villains.

916
01:10:26,389 --> 01:10:27,765
You think yourself a hero,

917
01:10:27,849 --> 01:10:29,489
but you would let these criminals go free,

918
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:31,686
knowing that many more
will suffer at their hands

919
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:32,854
unless we end them now.

920
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:35,606
Heroes don't kill people.

921
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:40,403
Well, I do.

922
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:43,364
Here we go.

923
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:46,052
Is that what I think it is?

924
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,388
<i>Twenty-three pounds of pure Eternium,</i>

925
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:51,933
much denser than typical artifacts
of the period.

926
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:53,827
King must have had a really strong neck.

927
01:11:53,851 --> 01:11:55,812
No, it snapped when I killed him.

928
01:11:57,814 --> 01:11:58,940
What's that?

929
01:11:59,023 --> 01:12:00,817
There's writing on the inside of the rim.

930
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:03,069
"Life is the only path to death."

931
01:12:04,028 --> 01:12:05,321
That's what it says.

932
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:08,491
Life is the only path to death.

933
01:12:08,574 --> 01:12:11,744
Well, that's surprisingly obvious.

934
01:12:11,828 --> 01:12:13,412
Could it have another meaning?

935
01:12:13,496 --> 01:12:15,414
What if it means, like,

936
01:12:15,498 --> 01:12:16,874
"Life is short.

937
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:19,234
You gotta hold on to what you love."

938
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:22,128
Stop.

939
01:12:22,755 --> 01:12:23,673
Deep.

940
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:25,341
It doesn't matter what it means.

941
01:12:25,424 --> 01:12:27,344
It should be buried
under the ocean for eternity.

942
01:12:27,385 --> 01:12:29,095
That's not far from what we had in mind

943
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:30,596
for you when this is over.

944
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,139
Or I could bury you with it.

945
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:35,643
We can't get rid of it now.

946
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:37,353
It's the one thing that Intergang wants.

947
01:12:37,937 --> 01:12:40,106
Believe me, I know more than anyone

948
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:41,732
what this crown is capable of.

949
01:12:41,816 --> 01:12:44,318
But we have to keep it
until my son is safe.

950
01:12:44,944 --> 01:12:46,028
Adrianna,

951
01:12:46,112 --> 01:12:47,947
trust me, we will get your son back.

952
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:50,283
They don't care about him.
They just want to defeat me.

953
01:12:50,825 --> 01:12:52,076
Hand it over.

954
01:12:53,911 --> 01:12:57,498
We can't risk letting the crown
fall into the wrong hands.

955
01:12:58,749 --> 01:13:00,918
We'll find another way.

956
01:13:03,337 --> 01:13:06,299
You like to split the world
into good and bad,

957
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:09,719
but that's easy to do
when you're the one drawing the line.

958
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:11,679
All I care about is Amon.

959
01:13:11,762 --> 01:13:15,808
And until he is safe,
we're all on the same side.

960
01:13:15,892 --> 01:13:19,645
And you, you will work together.

961
01:13:26,569 --> 01:13:28,821
Set a course
for the Al Hadidiyah Mountains.

962
01:13:29,322 --> 01:13:31,240
We'll go in at dawn.

963
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:34,035
I hope you can be a team player.

964
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:35,745
I love teams.

965
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:37,914
That was sarcasm again, yes?

966
01:13:37,997 --> 01:13:38,997
Very much so.

967
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:41,375
Good. Just checking.

968
01:13:51,928 --> 01:13:54,305
A wise man once told me a bad plan

969
01:13:54,388 --> 01:13:55,806
is better than no plan at all.

970
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:59,226
That was before we had a very bad plan.

971
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:00,519
Let it go.

972
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:03,898
I'd rather be fighting with him
than against him.

973
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:05,483
He's a murderer, Kent.

974
01:14:05,566 --> 01:14:08,319
If he turns on us,
that kid is as good as dead.

975
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:12,114
You don't get to decide who lives or dies.

976
01:14:13,157 --> 01:14:15,034
That's up to Fate.

977
01:14:15,534 --> 01:14:16,994
What's the helmet telling you?

978
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:19,789
Somebody's gonna die.

979
01:14:20,748 --> 01:14:22,959
Who is it, Atom Smasher?
It's Atom Smasher.

980
01:14:23,501 --> 01:14:25,169
Surprisingly, no.

981
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:27,254
Is it me?

982
01:14:33,260 --> 01:14:36,931
When it's time for you and I
to say goodbye, you'll know.

983
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:41,268
All I can tell you is,

984
01:14:43,187 --> 01:14:46,107
there's still time to change the future.

985
01:14:46,691 --> 01:14:48,192
Let's use it.

986
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:56,534
Well, I guess we're sticking
with the very bad plan.

987
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:09,856
<i>The Al Hadidiyah Mine</i>

988
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,160
<i>is Intergang's most valued asset.</i>

989
01:15:13,718 --> 01:15:14,969
I'm gonna land us right here,

990
01:15:15,052 --> 01:15:16,929
cut off their access to reinforcements.

991
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:20,182
But the perimeter of the mine
creates a natural fortress.

992
01:15:20,266 --> 01:15:22,435
There's only one way in, one way out.

993
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:24,603
We'll be an easy target
for their flybike patrol.

994
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:26,439
Communication is key.

995
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,899
We keep in step or we get outflanked.

996
01:15:28,983 --> 01:15:31,068
We move through the mine, inch by inch,

997
01:15:31,152 --> 01:15:32,236
until we find Amon.

998
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:35,031
This is where you come in.
Are you ready... Damn it.

999
01:15:52,465 --> 01:15:53,966
Or we could just do that.

1000
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:09,857
Pure Eternium shield.

1001
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:12,234
Unbreakable, even with your powers.

1002
01:16:19,867 --> 01:16:20,785
Amon!

1003
01:16:20,868 --> 01:16:22,745
You hurt him, I will kill all of you.

1004
01:16:23,204 --> 01:16:25,790
Nobody has to die. We just want the crown.

1005
01:16:26,165 --> 01:16:27,458
We don't have it.

1006
01:16:27,917 --> 01:16:31,879
Believe me, nothing good
will come from that crown.

1007
01:16:33,798 --> 01:16:36,967
No crown, no negotiation.

1008
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:39,178
I have it.

1009
01:16:40,888 --> 01:16:42,098
It's right here.

1010
01:16:42,932 --> 01:16:46,018
Release my son, you can have it.

1011
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:50,314
What do you think you're doing?

1012
01:16:51,816 --> 01:16:53,400
Intergang killed my husband.

1013
01:16:54,235 --> 01:16:56,112
I'm not letting them take my son, too.

1014
01:17:01,742 --> 01:17:04,328
Not your son. Not your country.

1015
01:17:05,913 --> 01:17:07,164
Not your decision to make.

1016
01:17:08,707 --> 01:17:09,707
Stop there!

1017
01:17:09,917 --> 01:17:12,628
It's okay. Nothing is gonna happen to you.

1018
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:14,213
Hand it over, now.

1019
01:17:15,422 --> 01:17:16,507
I'm sorry, Mom.

1020
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:24,932
Now, let Amon go.

1021
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:33,028
I thank you. And I thank your friends

1022
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:35,234
for returning the crown
to its rightful owner.

1023
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:41,115
What kind of Champion of Kahndaq
sides with foreign invaders?

1024
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:42,616
You have what you want.

1025
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:44,451
Let him go.

1026
01:17:44,535 --> 01:17:45,870
Ishmael, what are you doing?

1027
01:17:46,287 --> 01:17:47,621
Taking back what's mine.

1028
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:51,584
I'm the last living descendant
of King Ahk-Ton the Great.

1029
01:17:51,667 --> 01:17:54,128
<i>And you have just given me
everything I need</i>

1030
01:17:54,211 --> 01:17:57,923
to become the next king of Kahndaq.

1031
01:17:59,592 --> 01:18:01,510
My family passed the knowledge
on, you know,

1032
01:18:01,594 --> 01:18:02,845
one to the next.

1033
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:06,557
The crown, crafted by our ancestors,

1034
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:09,351
stolen by the wizards and hidden away.

1035
01:18:09,435 --> 01:18:11,353
But still a source of great power,

1036
01:18:11,437 --> 01:18:13,898
if only we can wield it.

1037
01:18:18,986 --> 01:18:23,616
They say when Hurut died,
you wept like a baby.

1038
01:18:25,075 --> 01:18:26,635
I wonder if you'll do the same for them.

1039
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:27,660
Please, Ishmael.

1040
01:18:27,995 --> 01:18:28,995
Sorry, Amon.

1041
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:32,833
Fate, get ready.

1042
01:18:32,917 --> 01:18:37,213
Death is the only path to life.

1043
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:42,384
Amon!

1044
01:19:48,575 --> 01:19:49,743
Amon!

1045
01:19:52,913 --> 01:19:54,123
He's alive.

1046
01:19:54,832 --> 01:19:56,500
But we need to get him to the medical bay.

1047
01:19:56,583 --> 01:19:58,419
- Where is he shot?
- It wasn't a bullet.

1048
01:19:58,502 --> 01:20:00,087
It was me.

1049
01:20:08,887 --> 01:20:09,930
Come.

1050
01:20:19,356 --> 01:20:20,899
We're going with you.

1051
01:20:20,983 --> 01:20:23,527
Just find the crown.
Get it on the cruiser.

1052
01:20:36,373 --> 01:20:39,752
I found the crown. But it's not alone.

1053
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:53,140
How long we gonna keep doing this?

1054
01:20:56,310 --> 01:21:00,522
There's no point in fighting.
We both know no one can stop me.

1055
01:21:01,357 --> 01:21:02,483
You're right.

1056
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:05,110
Only you can.

1057
01:21:06,111 --> 01:21:09,531
Ishmael said you cried when Hurut died.

1058
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:14,787
Who's Hurut?

1059
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:22,211
Hurut was a true Champion of Kahndaq.

1060
01:21:28,092 --> 01:21:30,469
<i>And he was also my son.</i>

1061
01:21:32,679 --> 01:21:34,932
I won't always be here to protect you.

1062
01:21:35,599 --> 01:21:36,850
I don't need protection.

1063
01:21:36,934 --> 01:21:38,310
I want to be free.

1064
01:21:39,937 --> 01:21:41,271
Freedom is for the birds.

1065
01:21:41,355 --> 01:21:43,440
Let someone else be the hero.

1066
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:46,777
The graveyards are full of them.

1067
01:21:51,824 --> 01:21:53,664
<i>I tried to protect him.</i>

1068
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:03,419
<i>But I wasn't strong enough.</i>

1069
01:22:08,132 --> 01:22:09,174
Shazam!

1070
01:22:11,218 --> 01:22:14,471
<i>The wizards decided
that he would be their champion.</i>

1071
01:22:14,847 --> 01:22:17,224
<i>But after the Champion's many victories,</i>

1072
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:19,935
<i>the king went after
what Hurut loved the most.</i>

1073
01:22:22,312 --> 01:22:24,398
<i>Our family.</i>

1074
01:22:41,206 --> 01:22:42,458
Hold on, Father.

1075
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:45,002
Stay with me.

1076
01:22:52,593 --> 01:22:53,677
With my powers,

1077
01:22:54,845 --> 01:22:56,388
you'll be safe.

1078
01:22:57,306 --> 01:22:59,016
I couldn't protect your mother.

1079
01:23:00,309 --> 01:23:02,644
Repeat what I say.

1080
01:23:03,604 --> 01:23:04,688
- Shazam.
- Shazam.

1081
01:23:17,784 --> 01:23:19,912
<i>Instead of battling the king,</i>

1082
01:23:21,079 --> 01:23:22,998
<i>instead of saving Kahndaq,</i>

1083
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:26,793
<i>Hurut chose to save</i>

1084
01:23:27,461 --> 01:23:28,462
<i>me.</i>

1085
01:23:45,354 --> 01:23:47,481
<i>But he couldn't save himself</i>

1086
01:23:47,564 --> 01:23:49,274
<i>from the king's assassins.</i>

1087
01:23:52,277 --> 01:23:53,588
<i>The powers were not a gift</i>

1088
01:23:53,612 --> 01:23:54,780
<i>from the wizards,</i>

1089
01:23:56,281 --> 01:23:57,281
<i>but a curse.</i>

1090
01:24:07,292 --> 01:24:10,003
<i>Born out of rage.</i>

1091
01:24:12,965 --> 01:24:14,925
The statue of the Champion isn't you.

1092
01:24:18,136 --> 01:24:19,263
It's Hurut.

1093
01:24:22,349 --> 01:24:24,643
My son dreamt of a better world.

1094
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:27,729
That's why he saved me.

1095
01:24:32,025 --> 01:24:34,486
But the world was only a better place
with him in it.

1096
01:24:50,544 --> 01:24:51,878
Kahndaq needed a hero.

1097
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:55,257
Instead, it got me.

1098
01:24:58,260 --> 01:24:59,595
All this power,

1099
01:25:01,305 --> 01:25:03,724
and the only thing I can do with it
is hurt people.

1100
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,393
I will speak the word my son gave me,

1101
01:25:07,311 --> 01:25:08,854
and I will give up my power.

1102
01:25:11,356 --> 01:25:15,068
And when I do, you must ensure
I never speak it again.

1103
01:25:21,158 --> 01:25:22,200
Shazam.

1104
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:32,502
Some men are not meant

1105
01:25:33,086 --> 01:25:34,963
to be heroes.

1106
01:26:38,527 --> 01:26:41,238
So beautiful.

1107
01:27:06,847 --> 01:27:08,140
Surprised to see us?

1108
01:27:08,598 --> 01:27:11,560
Surprise is a dirty word in this business.

1109
01:27:11,643 --> 01:27:13,395
Are you sure you can handle him?

1110
01:27:14,646 --> 01:27:15,998
You're the one who can see the future,

1111
01:27:16,022 --> 01:27:17,315
you'll tell me if we can't.

1112
01:27:17,399 --> 01:27:19,860
Just be careful with this one.

1113
01:27:19,943 --> 01:27:22,362
You know, they say the gods created us,

1114
01:27:22,446 --> 01:27:24,906
but we're the ones
who always wind up burying them.

1115
01:27:26,783 --> 01:27:28,618
Waller sends her regards.

1116
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:36,978
<i>They'll know how to deal with him.</i>

1117
01:27:37,002 --> 01:27:39,880
<i>To keep him from regaining his powers,</i>

1118
01:27:39,963 --> 01:27:41,965
<i>they'll keep him in suspended animation.</i>

1119
01:27:49,639 --> 01:27:53,351
<i>As long as he's submerged,
he won't be able to speak.</i>

1120
01:27:57,773 --> 01:28:00,317
<i>He'll never say another word again.</i>

1121
01:28:19,044 --> 01:28:21,046
Hey! There he is.

1122
01:28:21,588 --> 01:28:24,299
Not all heroes wear capes,
but I think you earned this.

1123
01:28:25,258 --> 01:28:26,527
Well, statistically,

1124
01:28:26,551 --> 01:28:29,221
most heroes don't wear capes.
But, yeah, try it on.

1125
01:28:32,682 --> 01:28:33,975
Yeah, looks pretty good.

1126
01:28:37,437 --> 01:28:38,897
That's a nice touch.

1127
01:29:19,688 --> 01:29:20,688
Kent.

1128
01:29:26,736 --> 01:29:27,904
Mission accomplished?

1129
01:29:28,238 --> 01:29:29,614
My vision hasn't changed.

1130
01:29:30,282 --> 01:29:32,367
But Teth Adam's out of the equation.

1131
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:35,245
Kent, if this isn't over,
I need to know what's coming.

1132
01:29:35,328 --> 01:29:37,205
What is the helmet telling you?

1133
01:29:38,623 --> 01:29:41,960
My vision has always shown me
a great calamity.

1134
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:43,879
The world in flames.

1135
01:29:43,962 --> 01:29:45,422
We can stop it,

1136
01:29:47,173 --> 01:29:48,925
but you die.

1137
01:29:50,635 --> 01:29:52,345
You should've told me sooner.

1138
01:29:55,223 --> 01:29:57,267
I have no fear of death.

1139
01:29:57,350 --> 01:29:59,269
That's precisely why I didn't tell you.

1140
01:29:59,352 --> 01:30:01,605
The world needs the Justice Society.

1141
01:30:01,688 --> 01:30:03,523
The world needs you.

1142
01:30:03,607 --> 01:30:06,484
But you can't choose who lives and dies.

1143
01:30:06,568 --> 01:30:08,111
That's Fate, right?

1144
01:30:10,947 --> 01:30:13,074
That sounds familiar.

1145
01:30:15,368 --> 01:30:17,913
I remember seeing my first airplane.

1146
01:30:18,997 --> 01:30:23,209
It was an RAF deployment,
headed to the Western Front.

1147
01:30:24,002 --> 01:30:26,755
Everyone on my street
came out to see them off.

1148
01:30:28,632 --> 01:30:30,216
But I didn't cheer.

1149
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:33,720
Even though I was only a boy.

1150
01:30:34,554 --> 01:30:38,099
I knew where they were headed,
and what awaited them.

1151
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:40,602
Thanks to this, I've lived longer

1152
01:30:40,685 --> 01:30:42,395
than I could've ever have hoped for.

1153
01:30:42,979 --> 01:30:44,522
I've seen the world change

1154
01:30:44,606 --> 01:30:46,775
in more ways than I could've imagined.

1155
01:30:49,819 --> 01:30:51,738
I'm still a sentimental fool.

1156
01:30:53,239 --> 01:30:55,450
And I don't want my friend to die.

1157
01:31:03,166 --> 01:31:07,170
Ishmael said,
"Death is the only path to life."

1158
01:31:08,046 --> 01:31:10,382
But that's not what the inscription says.

1159
01:31:10,465 --> 01:31:13,760
Right. "Life is the only path to death."

1160
01:31:13,843 --> 01:31:14,970
Maybe he got it backwards,

1161
01:31:15,053 --> 01:31:17,597
like he read it in a mirror or something.

1162
01:31:17,681 --> 01:31:18,556
That's it.

1163
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:21,643
In Kahndaqi mythology,
the souls of the damned

1164
01:31:21,726 --> 01:31:23,353
are sent to the Rock of Finality.

1165
01:31:23,436 --> 01:31:25,772
The underworld is a mirror to our own.

1166
01:31:25,855 --> 01:31:27,941
Here, turn the crown around.

1167
01:31:29,401 --> 01:31:30,694
Now mirror the letters.

1168
01:31:30,777 --> 01:31:33,822
See? That's what I missed.

1169
01:31:33,905 --> 01:31:37,951
"Death is the only path to life."

1170
01:31:41,621 --> 01:31:44,165
<i>He kidnapped Amon on purpose,</i>

1171
01:31:44,249 --> 01:31:46,501
<i>because he knew
that Teth Adam would kill him.</i>

1172
01:31:46,584 --> 01:31:48,753
<i>And he believed the Champion's magic</i>

1173
01:31:48,837 --> 01:31:50,797
<i>would send him to the Rock of Finality.</i>

1174
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:53,842
As life is the path to death.

1175
01:31:53,925 --> 01:31:58,221
Now your death is a path to life.

1176
01:31:58,304 --> 01:32:00,390
The wizards have their champion,

1177
01:32:00,473 --> 01:32:02,642
now we have ours.

1178
01:32:02,726 --> 01:32:05,562
You will take the throne of Kahndaq

1179
01:32:05,645 --> 01:32:09,482
and unleash hell on Earth!

1180
01:32:09,566 --> 01:32:11,693
Speak our name.

1181
01:32:12,444 --> 01:32:13,570
"Sabbac."

1182
01:32:34,758 --> 01:32:36,801
What the bloody hell is that?

1183
01:32:36,885 --> 01:32:38,654
Readout says it's the demon, Sabbac.

1184
01:32:38,678 --> 01:32:40,680
Get me closer. Now, right now!

1185
01:32:40,764 --> 01:32:42,849
We're 100 miles out, give me 20 seconds!

1186
01:32:50,565 --> 01:32:52,776
The king has returned.

1187
01:32:53,693 --> 01:32:55,904
The throne will be mine.

1188
01:32:58,198 --> 01:32:59,449
Brace yourselves!

1189
01:33:05,371 --> 01:33:06,498
Hold on!

1190
01:33:43,618 --> 01:33:45,178
Now prepare to die.

1191
01:33:50,917 --> 01:33:52,252
Wait, wait, where's Uncle Karim?

1192
01:34:09,227 --> 01:34:12,272
No matter what happens,
he does not sit on that throne.

1193
01:34:15,567 --> 01:34:17,419
- Copy that.
- We're on it!

1194
01:34:17,443 --> 01:34:18,443
Heads up!

1195
01:35:03,156 --> 01:35:04,240
Activate infrared.

1196
01:35:08,077 --> 01:35:09,787
Sabbac, show yourself!

1197
01:35:12,248 --> 01:35:15,168
Adrianna! Amon!

1198
01:35:19,380 --> 01:35:20,924
That's for my cruiser.

1199
01:35:59,545 --> 01:36:00,755
This is it.

1200
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:03,675
We can't win, Carter.

1201
01:36:03,758 --> 01:36:06,803
Yeah, but the world burns
if we don't. Right?

1202
01:36:09,013 --> 01:36:11,349
Bad plan is better than no plan at all.

1203
01:36:38,209 --> 01:36:40,253
No, no, no. What are you doing?

1204
01:36:40,336 --> 01:36:42,130
Giving us a third option.

1205
01:36:42,213 --> 01:36:43,506
It's supposed to be me.

1206
01:36:43,589 --> 01:36:45,883
I didn't tell you my whole vision,
old friend.

1207
01:36:46,968 --> 01:36:48,303
I did see your death.

1208
01:36:48,386 --> 01:36:50,763
But I also found a way to prevent it.

1209
01:36:50,847 --> 01:36:52,890
It has been an extraordinary life,

1210
01:36:52,974 --> 01:36:55,310
but always with one foot in the future.

1211
01:36:55,393 --> 01:36:58,604
Carter, for the first time in 100 years,

1212
01:36:58,688 --> 01:37:00,273
when I look ahead,

1213
01:37:02,608 --> 01:37:03,818
I see nothing.

1214
01:37:03,901 --> 01:37:04,902
No, Kent.

1215
01:37:04,986 --> 01:37:05,987
And

1216
01:37:06,988 --> 01:37:08,031
it's

1217
01:37:08,906 --> 01:37:09,906
beautiful.

1218
01:37:10,116 --> 01:37:11,116
Wait, Kent!

1219
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:12,118
Goodbye...

1220
01:37:12,201 --> 01:37:13,911
Kent!

1221
01:37:13,995 --> 01:37:15,079
My dear friend.

1222
01:37:15,163 --> 01:37:16,289
Kent!

1223
01:37:18,875 --> 01:37:20,460
Hit it from every side.

1224
01:37:22,253 --> 01:37:24,464
Kent!

1225
01:37:47,820 --> 01:37:52,992
I am Dr. Fate, sorcerer,
agent of the Lords of Order,

1226
01:37:53,076 --> 01:37:56,120
defender against darkness and chaos,

1227
01:37:56,204 --> 01:37:59,749
but even my powers cannot defeat you.

1228
01:38:09,050 --> 01:38:11,469
There's no one that can defeat me.

1229
01:38:15,723 --> 01:38:19,602
There is one.

1230
01:38:20,144 --> 01:38:21,354
Teth Adam.

1231
01:38:22,855 --> 01:38:24,357
I know you can hear me.

1232
01:38:26,317 --> 01:38:30,279
<i>The battle your son was meant to fight
is upon us.</i>

1233
01:38:30,363 --> 01:38:32,490
<i>Now you are the only one</i>

1234
01:38:32,573 --> 01:38:35,326
<i>who can defeat the Demon Champion.</i>

1235
01:39:00,935 --> 01:39:02,270
<i>You have the power</i>

1236
01:39:02,353 --> 01:39:04,730
<i>to be the destroyer of this world.</i>

1237
01:39:07,650 --> 01:39:10,445
But you can also be its savior.

1238
01:39:27,211 --> 01:39:29,714
<i>You believe you are not a worthy champion,</i>

1239
01:39:29,797 --> 01:39:32,550
<i>because the wizards did not choose you.</i>

1240
01:39:33,009 --> 01:39:36,637
<i>But Fate does not make mistakes.
Neither did your son.</i>

1241
01:39:40,808 --> 01:39:42,685
<i>We were wrong about you.</i>

1242
01:39:42,768 --> 01:39:45,188
<i>The world doesn't always need
a white knight.</i>

1243
01:39:45,938 --> 01:39:47,940
<i>Sometimes it needs something darker.</i>

1244
01:40:03,831 --> 01:40:06,667
<i>Don't you dare give up on us now.</i>

1245
01:40:06,751 --> 01:40:08,252
The world needs you.

1246
01:41:15,236 --> 01:41:16,236
Kent!

1247
01:42:31,812 --> 01:42:33,939
Mom? What's happening?

1248
01:42:36,484 --> 01:42:37,485
It's Sabbac.

1249
01:42:38,194 --> 01:42:39,904
He commands the Legions of Hell.

1250
01:42:40,488 --> 01:42:41,697
Whatever happens,

1251
01:42:43,324 --> 01:42:44,659
you stay behind me.

1252
01:42:55,711 --> 01:42:57,046
<i>Baby, come back</i>

1253
01:42:59,090 --> 01:43:01,550
Don't worry, I die by electricity!

1254
01:43:03,344 --> 01:43:05,971
You want some Kahndaq? Come and get it!

1255
01:43:06,055 --> 01:43:07,348
Come and get it!

1256
01:43:07,765 --> 01:43:08,974
No, no. No.

1257
01:43:09,058 --> 01:43:11,143
- Don't send me home, I can help.
- I know.

1258
01:43:11,811 --> 01:43:14,188
But you can do better
than swinging a stick.

1259
01:43:52,601 --> 01:43:55,563
The gods have brought us together again.

1260
01:43:57,481 --> 01:44:00,192
It's not your time, Father.

1261
01:44:05,573 --> 01:44:07,032
What are you all standing around for?

1262
01:44:08,242 --> 01:44:09,827
This is our chance.

1263
01:44:12,913 --> 01:44:15,416
With these hands, we built Kahndaq.

1264
01:44:16,041 --> 01:44:18,169
And with these hands, we will set it free!

1265
01:44:24,383 --> 01:44:26,135
The people need a hero.

1266
01:44:27,887 --> 01:44:28,971
No, Father.

1267
01:44:30,097 --> 01:44:32,183
They need to be free.

1268
01:44:36,187 --> 01:44:37,605
What are we waiting for?

1269
01:45:00,294 --> 01:45:02,713
Say the word.

1270
01:45:03,964 --> 01:45:05,257
Shazam.

1271
01:45:15,768 --> 01:45:18,687
The people of Kahndaq rise up against you!

1272
01:45:47,132 --> 01:45:48,759
Yes!

1273
01:45:51,470 --> 01:45:53,597
I got this.

1274
01:45:55,474 --> 01:45:56,474
Go get him.

1275
01:46:14,368 --> 01:46:15,911
You know what I have to do.

1276
01:46:17,746 --> 01:46:19,331
Beat his ass!

1277
01:46:19,415 --> 01:46:21,417
Let the fate of Kahndaq be decided

1278
01:46:21,500 --> 01:46:24,420
by a true battle of champions.

1279
01:46:25,254 --> 01:46:26,922
Let's end this.

1280
01:46:52,865 --> 01:46:54,116
It's a lot of them.

1281
01:46:55,701 --> 01:46:57,703
- It's a bit more than I thought.
- Yeah.

1282
01:46:58,412 --> 01:46:59,412
Just a bit.

1283
01:47:07,212 --> 01:47:08,380
Hey, Mom!

1284
01:47:16,055 --> 01:47:19,099
These are our streets! Our city!

1285
01:47:20,809 --> 01:47:23,020
Free Kahndaq!

1286
01:47:30,611 --> 01:47:33,197
The wizards' powers
were wasted on you.

1287
01:47:33,280 --> 01:47:35,282
You are not a hero.

1288
01:47:37,785 --> 01:47:40,996
No. I'm not.

1289
01:47:41,830 --> 01:47:44,124
But he is.

1290
01:47:55,552 --> 01:47:57,429
You cannot stand against me.

1291
01:47:57,805 --> 01:48:00,474
I am Kahndaq's true champion.

1292
01:48:10,150 --> 01:48:12,736
I learned this trick from an old friend.

1293
01:48:51,775 --> 01:48:53,193
You can control it!

1294
01:48:57,448 --> 01:48:58,824
You have to!

1295
01:49:09,835 --> 01:49:11,795
Tell them the Man in Black sent you.

1296
01:50:02,096 --> 01:50:04,723
I never thought I'd be happy to see you.

1297
01:50:07,851 --> 01:50:09,770
I'm only here because of him.

1298
01:50:12,564 --> 01:50:14,441
That makes two of us.

1299
01:50:31,708 --> 01:50:33,585
See you around, old friend.

1300
01:50:48,642 --> 01:50:50,352
Think you can keep him out of trouble?

1301
01:50:50,435 --> 01:50:52,146
As long as no one comes looking for it.

1302
01:50:52,437 --> 01:50:53,689
Fair enough.

1303
01:50:55,399 --> 01:50:56,817
Just be careful.

1304
01:50:56,900 --> 01:51:00,362
The kind of justice you dish out
can darken your soul.

1305
01:51:00,445 --> 01:51:02,948
It's his darkness that lets him do

1306
01:51:03,031 --> 01:51:05,576
what heroes like you cannot.

1307
01:51:07,452 --> 01:51:09,580
I guess we'll find out, won't we?

1308
01:51:17,713 --> 01:51:19,673
I thought we made
a pretty good team back there.

1309
01:51:20,048 --> 01:51:21,175
Just saying.

1310
01:51:22,885 --> 01:51:24,511
We made a great team.

1311
01:51:30,392 --> 01:51:31,792
- Maybe we could...
- Don't push it.

1312
01:51:32,436 --> 01:51:34,062
Smasher, let's go.

1313
01:51:45,199 --> 01:51:48,118
Long live the Champion!

1314
01:51:48,202 --> 01:51:53,582
Long live the Champion!
Long live the Champion!

1315
01:51:55,834 --> 01:51:57,211
You could lead them.

1316
01:52:30,869 --> 01:52:32,162
How does it feel?

1317
01:52:33,997 --> 01:52:35,123
Wrong.

1318
01:52:46,635 --> 01:52:48,762
So, what now?

1319
01:52:48,845 --> 01:52:51,139
Does this mean
you're finally gonna be our hero?

1320
01:52:51,223 --> 01:52:53,308
Kahndaq has always had heroes.

1321
01:52:54,434 --> 01:52:55,602
And it still does.

1322
01:52:56,645 --> 01:52:59,273
What it needs now is a protector.

1323
01:52:59,356 --> 01:53:00,899
Thank you, Teth Adam.

1324
01:53:00,983 --> 01:53:03,735
Perhaps that name is a little

1325
01:53:04,236 --> 01:53:05,320
old-fashioned.

1326
01:53:06,613 --> 01:53:08,156
So what should we call you?

1327
01:56:03,373 --> 01:56:05,667
<i>Okay, "Black Adam."</i>

1328
01:56:06,585 --> 01:56:08,420
<i>My name is Amanda Waller.</i>

1329
01:56:08,545 --> 01:56:11,339
<i>Congratulations, you have my attention.</i>

1330
01:56:11,423 --> 01:56:14,259
<i>This is gonna be your only warning.</i>

1331
01:56:15,594 --> 01:56:17,804
<i>You don't want to stay in my prison,
that's fine.</i>

1332
01:56:18,430 --> 01:56:20,932
<i>Kahndaq is your prison now.</i>

1333
01:56:21,016 --> 01:56:24,853
<i>You step one foot outside of it,
you will not live to regret it.</i>

1334
01:56:27,105 --> 01:56:29,232
There's no one on this planet
that can stop me.

1335
01:56:29,316 --> 01:56:31,085
<i>I can call in a favor and send people</i>

1336
01:56:31,109 --> 01:56:32,861
<i>who aren't from this planet.</i>

1337
01:56:35,030 --> 01:56:36,740
Send them all.

1338
01:56:38,074 --> 01:56:39,201
<i>As you wish.</i>

1339
01:56:54,132 --> 01:56:57,552
It's been a while since anyone's
made the world this nervous.

1340
01:57:03,558 --> 01:57:04,726
Black Adam.

1341
01:57:06,311 --> 01:57:08,021
We should talk.
