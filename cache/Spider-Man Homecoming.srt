1
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:42,949
Things are never gonna be the same now.

2
00:00:42,974 --> 00:00:45,011
I mean, look at this.

3
00:00:45,306 --> 00:00:47,050
You got aliens.

4
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:50,781
You got big green guys
tearing down buildings.

5
00:00:50,806 --> 00:00:54,003
When I was a kid,
I used to draw cowboys and Indians.

6
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:57,378
Actually, it's Native American,
but whatever.

7
00:00:58,455 --> 00:01:00,660
Yeah. Tell you what, though.

8
00:01:01,382 --> 00:01:03,191
It ain't bad, is it?

9
00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:07,363
No. Yeah. Kid's got a future.

10
00:01:07,589 --> 00:01:09,376
Yeah, well...

11
00:01:10,154 --> 00:01:11,683
...we'll see, I guess.

12
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,456
No, hey!

13
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:40,292
You can't saw through that stuff.

14
00:01:40,848 --> 00:01:43,042
These alien bastards are tough.

15
00:01:43,067 --> 00:01:45,167
You gotta use the stuff they use.

16
00:01:47,624 --> 00:01:49,558
- See? All right.
- All right.

17
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,410
Oh, hey!

18
00:01:54,369 --> 00:01:56,341
Glad you could join us. Afternoon.

19
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,608
- Yeah. My alarm didn't go off.
- Yeah, your alarm.

20
00:01:58,633 --> 00:02:01,582
Look, just go stack that armor plating
like I asked you.

21
00:02:01,607 --> 00:02:03,394
This is a huge deal for us.

22
00:02:03,592 --> 00:02:05,049
Attention, please!

23
00:02:05,117 --> 00:02:08,228
In accordance with Executive Order 396B,

24
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:11,933
all post-battle cleanup operations
are now under our jurisdiction.

25
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:14,144
Thank you for your service.
We'll take it from here.

26
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:15,455
Who the hell are you?

27
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,134
Qualified personnel.

28
00:02:17,335 --> 00:02:21,605
Look, I have a city contract to salvage
all this, okay, with the city, so-

29
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:26,269
I apologize, Mr. Toomes, but all salvage
operations are now under our jurisdiction.

30
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,000
Please turn over any and all
exotic materials that you've collected

31
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,357
or you will be prosecuted.

32
00:02:31,641 --> 00:02:33,152
Ma'am, what am...

33
00:02:33,583 --> 00:02:36,324
Please. Come here. Hey, lady, come on.

34
00:02:36,564 --> 00:02:37,964
Look...

35
00:02:38,784 --> 00:02:40,946
...I bought trucks for this job.

36
00:02:40,971 --> 00:02:43,734
I brought in a whole new crew.
These guys have a family.

37
00:02:43,758 --> 00:02:45,155
I have a family.

38
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:47,441
I'm all in on this. I could lose my house.

39
00:02:47,466 --> 00:02:50,042
I'm sorry, sir. There's nothing I can do.

40
00:02:51,043 --> 00:02:53,269
Maybe next time, don't overextend yourself.

41
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,461
What'd you say?

42
00:02:58,531 --> 00:02:59,800
Yeah.

43
00:03:00,093 --> 00:03:02,683
He's right. I overextended myself.

44
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:05,160
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Don't do it.

45
00:03:06,517 --> 00:03:08,066
Put them down.

46
00:03:10,236 --> 00:03:13,354
If you have a grievance,
you may take it up with my superiors.

47
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:16,316
Your superiors. Who the hell are they?

48
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,341
A joint venture between Stark Industries
and the government,

49
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:21,957
the Department of Damage Control,
will oversee the collection

50
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:25,032
and storage of alien
and other exotic materials.

51
00:03:25,275 --> 00:03:28,246
Now the assholes who made this mess
are paid to clean it up.

52
00:03:28,271 --> 00:03:29,512
Yeah, it's all rigged.

53
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,438
Experts estimate there are
over 1500 tons of exotic material

54
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,607
scattered throughout the tri-state area.

55
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:37,097
Hey, chief!

56
00:03:37,436 --> 00:03:41,035
We have another load from yesterday.
We're supposed to turn this in, right?

57
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,167
I ain't hauling it.

58
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:46,637
It's too bad. We could have made
some cool stuff from all that alien junk.

59
00:03:49,025 --> 00:03:50,175
I tell you what.

60
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,363
Let's keep it.

61
00:03:54,646 --> 00:03:56,308
The world's changing.

62
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,574
It's time we change, too.

63
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,157
There you go, Mason.

64
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,863
Business is good.

65
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,294
New York. Queens.

66
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,328
It's a rough borough, but, hey, it's home.

67
00:05:40,352 --> 00:05:41,922
Who you talking to?

68
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,402
No one.
Just making a little video of the trip.

69
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,840
- You know you can't show it to anyone.
- Yeah, I know.

70
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,845
Then why are you narrating in that voice?

71
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,121
- Because it's fun.
- Fun.

72
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:54,160
So why do they call you Happy?

73
00:05:56,718 --> 00:05:59,503
Come on. I'm not carrying your bags.
Let's go.

74
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,688
Hey, should I go to the bathroom before?

75
00:06:01,713 --> 00:06:03,089
There's a bathroom on it.

76
00:06:03,652 --> 00:06:05,355
No pilot? That's awesome.

77
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,069
- Is that where you're gonna sit?
- Yeah.

78
00:06:08,094 --> 00:06:10,246
This is your first time on a private plane?

79
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:11,948
My first time on any plane.

80
00:06:11,973 --> 00:06:14,621
Should it... Should it be...
Should it be making that noise?

81
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,840
No one has actually told me
why I'm in Berlin or what I'm doing.

82
00:06:27,865 --> 00:06:31,366
Something about
Captain America going crazy.

83
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,178
- This is you.
- Oh, we're neighbors?

84
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,434
We're not roommates. Suit up.

85
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:37,080
Okay, Peter, you got this.

86
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,730
What the hell are you wearing?

87
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:40,189
It's my suit.

88
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,175
- Where's the case?
- What case?

89
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,045
What? I thought that was a closet.

90
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,463
- This is still my room?
- Go, please.

91
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,275
- My room is way bigger than...
- There.

92
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,246
I found the case. I found the case.

93
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,535
"A minor upgrade"?

94
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,832
Oh, my God.

95
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:56,527
- Put it on.
- What the...

96
00:06:56,552 --> 00:06:58,550
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen...

97
00:06:58,575 --> 00:06:59,508
Let's go.

98
00:06:59,532 --> 00:07:02,297
But, yeah. Well, I don't understand.
Is it for me?

99
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:03,659
Happy. Happy, wait.

100
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,735
This is insane. Insane.

101
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,877
Look at this thing. Look. Look at the eyes.

102
00:07:08,902 --> 00:07:09,843
This is the greatest day of my life.

103
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:11,189
- Let's go.
- Okay.

104
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:15,785
Okay, there's Captain America, Iron Man,
Black Widow. Who's that new guy?

105
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,206
- Underoos!
- Oh, that's me. I gotta go. I gotta go.

106
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:21,511
Hey, everyone.

107
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,987
Okay, the craziest thing just happened.

108
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:28,692
I just had a fight with Captain America.
I stole his shield. I threw it at him...

109
00:07:28,802 --> 00:07:31,323
What the hell? He's big now.
I gotta go. Hang on.

110
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,566
It was the most amazing thing!
Mr. Stark was like, "Hey, Underoos!"

111
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:41,003
And I flipped in and stole Cap's shield.
I was like, "What's up, everybody?"

112
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:41,812
And then...

113
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:43,909
Hey, just a second! Coming!

114
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:46,980
Hey.

115
00:07:47,493 --> 00:07:49,109
We have thin walls here.

116
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:52,972
What are you doing, a little video diary?

117
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,181
- Yeah.
- It's all right.

118
00:07:55,206 --> 00:07:57,035
- I'd do the same thing.
- I told him not to do it.

119
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,354
He was filming everything.
I'm gonna wipe the chip.

120
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:00,580
Hey. You know what?

121
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:04,084
We should actually make an alibi video
for your aunt anyway. You ready?

122
00:08:04,109 --> 00:08:06,522
- An alibi? Sure. Okay.
- We rolling? Get in the frame.

123
00:08:06,547 --> 00:08:09,730
Hey, May. How you doing? What are
you wearing? Something skimpy, I hope.

124
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,112
Peter, that's inappropriate.
Let's start over. You can edit it.

125
00:08:14,137 --> 00:08:15,343
Three, two, one.

126
00:08:15,367 --> 00:08:16,346
Hey, May.

127
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:22,881
My gosh, I wanted to tell you what an
incredible job your nephew did this weekend

128
00:08:22,905 --> 00:08:25,556
at the Stark internship retreat.

129
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:27,705
Everyone was impressed.

130
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:30,025
Come on! It's a freaking merge. I'm sorry.

131
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,845
This is because
you're not on Queens Boulevard.

132
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:35,031
See, Happy is hoping to get bumped up
to asset management.

133
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,666
He was forehead of security,
before that he was a driver.

134
00:08:37,691 --> 00:08:39,494
That was a private conversation.

135
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,497
I don't like joking about this.
It was hard for me to talk about that.

136
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,928
No, seriously, was he snoring a bunch?

137
00:08:43,952 --> 00:08:45,728
All right, here we are. End of the line.

138
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,322
- Happy, can you give us a moment?
- You want me to leave the car?

139
00:08:50,347 --> 00:08:52,141
Why don't you grab Peter's case
out of the trunk?

140
00:08:53,576 --> 00:08:55,112
I can keep the suit?

141
00:08:55,137 --> 00:08:57,220
Yes, we were just talking about it.

142
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,708
Do me a favor, though.
Happy's kind of your point guy on this.

143
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:05,721
Don't stress him out. Don't do anything
stupid. I've seen his cardiogram.

144
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,628
- All right?
- Yes.

145
00:09:07,703 --> 00:09:10,775
Don't do anything I would do,
and don't do anything I wouldn't do.

146
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:14,385
There's a little gray area in there.
And that's where you operate.

147
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,447
- Wait, does that mean I'm an Avenger?
- No.

148
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:18,965
- This it?
- Seventh floor.

149
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,811
I can take that. You don't have to.

150
00:09:20,835 --> 00:09:22,498
- You can take it?
- Yeah, I can take that.

151
00:09:22,522 --> 00:09:23,689
Thank you.

152
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,846
So when's our next...
When's our next "retreat", you know?

153
00:09:28,172 --> 00:09:29,303
What, next mission?

154
00:09:29,327 --> 00:09:30,885
Yeah, the mission. The missions.

155
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:31,943
We'll call you.

156
00:09:31,967 --> 00:09:34,322
- Do you have my numbers?
- No, I mean, we'll call you.

157
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,697
Like, someone will call you. All right?

158
00:09:36,722 --> 00:09:38,361
- From your team.
- Okay. All right.

159
00:09:38,794 --> 00:09:42,629
It's not a hug. I'm just grabbing
the door for you. We're not there yet.

160
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:46,283
Bye.

161
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,322
They're gonna call me.

162
00:10:43,163 --> 00:10:44,791
What's up, Penis Parker?

163
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:50,463
Rise and shine,
Midtown Science and Technology.

164
00:10:50,488 --> 00:10:52,710
Don't forget about your homecoming tickets.

165
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,656
Do you have a date for homecoming?

166
00:10:54,681 --> 00:10:56,798
Thanks, Jason, but I already have a date.

167
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,283
- Okay.
- Yeah.

168
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:07,838
Damn it. You, in my office right now.

169
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,622
Join me, and together

170
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,934
we'll build my new LEGO Death Star.

171
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,562
- What?
- So lame.

172
00:11:35,101 --> 00:11:36,754
No way, that's awesome. How many pieces?

173
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,756
Three thousand eight hundred and three.

174
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,632
- That's insane.
- I know.

175
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:42,295
You want to build it tonight?

176
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:43,996
No, I can't tonight. I've got the Stark...

177
00:11:44,021 --> 00:11:45,999
- Stark internship.
- Yeah, exactly.

178
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:47,515
Always got that internship.

179
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:50,453
Yeah, well, hopefully,
soon it'll lead to a real job with them.

180
00:11:50,556 --> 00:11:52,270
- That would be so sweet.
- Right?

181
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:55,937
He'd be all, "Good job on those
spreadsheets, Peter. Here's a gold coin."

182
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,374
- I don't know how jobs work.
- That's exactly how they work.

183
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,015
I'll knock out the bones of
the Death Star at my place.

184
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,757
And then I'll come by afterwards

185
00:12:04,782 --> 00:12:07,109
because for the most part,
the difficult thing is the base of it...

186
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:10,257
The top half
we can knock out in two hours, tops.

187
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:13,814
That'd be great.

188
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,093
I'm gonna be late.

189
00:12:15,118 --> 00:12:20,234
Okay, so how do we calculate linear
acceleration between points A and B?

190
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,277
Flash.

191
00:12:22,302 --> 00:12:25,554
It's the product of sine of the angle
and gravity divided by mass.

192
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:26,472
Nope.

193
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:27,632
Peter.

194
00:12:27,777 --> 00:12:29,023
You still with us?

195
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,921
Yeah, yeah.

196
00:12:34,104 --> 00:12:36,804
Mass cancels out,
so it's just gravity times sine.

197
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:40,874
Right. See, Flash, being the fastest
isn't always the best if you are wrong.

198
00:12:41,054 --> 00:12:42,507
You're dead.

199
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:50,452
Today we're gonna be talking
about Danish physicist Niels Bohr,

200
00:12:50,477 --> 00:12:53,445
but trust me,
there's nothing Bohr-ing...

201
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:56,611
...about his discoveries regarding
quantum theory.

202
00:13:07,307 --> 00:13:08,757
Did Liz get a new top?

203
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:12,695
No. We've seen that before,
but never with that skirt.

204
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,148
- Liz, hey. That looks so good.
- Hi!

205
00:13:15,748 --> 00:13:18,507
We should probably stop staring
before it gets creepy.

206
00:13:18,532 --> 00:13:19,773
Too late.

207
00:13:20,179 --> 00:13:21,590
You guys are losers.

208
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,054
Well, then why do you sit with us?

209
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,615
Because I don't have any friends.

210
00:13:27,798 --> 00:13:29,726
Let's move to the next question.

211
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,468
What is the heaviest
naturally-occurring element?

212
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,682
Hydrogen's the lightest.

213
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,343
That's not the question. Okay.

214
00:13:36,368 --> 00:13:37,773
- Yeah.
- Uranium.

215
00:13:38,241 --> 00:13:40,031
That is correct. Thank you, Abraham.

216
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,281
Please open your books to page 10.

217
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:47,035
Peter, it's Nationals. Is there no way
you could take one weekend off?

218
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,046
I can't go to Washington. If Mr. Stark
needs me, I have to make sure I'm here.

219
00:13:51,071 --> 00:13:53,554
You've never been in the same room
as Tony Stark.

220
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:55,031
Wait. What's happening?

221
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:57,629
- Peter's not going to Washington.
- No. No, no, no.

222
00:13:57,654 --> 00:13:59,457
- No.
- Why not?

223
00:13:59,591 --> 00:14:01,421
Really? Right before Nationals?

224
00:14:01,446 --> 00:14:03,531
He already quit marching band
and robotics lab.

225
00:14:05,381 --> 00:14:07,617
I'm not obsessed with him.
Just very observant.

226
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,009
Flash, you're in for Peter.

227
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,452
I don't know.
I gotta check my calendar first.

228
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,685
I got a hot date with Black Widow
coming up.

229
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,641
That is false.

230
00:14:16,666 --> 00:14:19,460
What'd I tell you about using the bell
for comedic purposes?

231
00:14:36,373 --> 00:14:37,940
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, man.

232
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,874
What's up, Mr. Delmar?

233
00:14:41,899 --> 00:14:43,435
Hey, Mr. Parker.

234
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:44,965
Number five, right?

235
00:14:45,071 --> 00:14:48,564
Yeah, and with pickles, and can
you smush it down real flat? Thanks.

236
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,057
You got it, boss.

237
00:14:50,392 --> 00:14:51,928
How's your aunt?

238
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,633
Yeah, she's all right.

239
00:14:53,981 --> 00:14:56,761
She's a very hot Italian woman.

240
00:14:57,766 --> 00:14:59,362
How's your daughter?

241
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:02,945
Ten dollars.

242
00:15:02,961 --> 00:15:04,185
It's 5 dollars.

243
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:07,378
- For that comment, 10 dollars.
- Hey, come on. I'm joking. I'm joking.

244
00:15:08,767 --> 00:15:10,222
Here's 5 dollars.

245
00:15:11,233 --> 00:15:12,839
What's up, Murph?

246
00:15:13,707 --> 00:15:15,448
How you doing, buddy?

247
00:15:16,831 --> 00:15:18,643
So how's school?

248
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,625
It's boring. Got better things to do.

249
00:15:20,841 --> 00:15:24,222
Stay in school, kid. Stay in school.
Otherwise, you're gonna end up like me.

250
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,784
- This is great.
- Best sandwiches in Queens.

251
00:16:37,569 --> 00:16:38,605
Finally.

252
00:16:43,313 --> 00:16:44,464
What's wrong with you?

253
00:16:44,489 --> 00:16:45,980
Could you hold this for a second?

254
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:47,078
Thanks.

255
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,360
Hey, is this anybody's bike?

256
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:51,618
No?

257
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,515
- Hey, buddy, is this your bike?
- I have no change.

258
00:16:54,594 --> 00:16:56,547
Does anyone have a pen? Do you have a pen?

259
00:17:01,062 --> 00:17:02,428
Everybody good?

260
00:17:08,662 --> 00:17:09,743
Hey!

261
00:17:10,292 --> 00:17:12,662
You're that spider guy on YouTube, right?

262
00:17:12,687 --> 00:17:13,951
Call me Spider-Man.

263
00:17:13,976 --> 00:17:16,685
Okay, Spider-Man. Do a flip.

264
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,328
- Yeah!
- Not bad.

265
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,168
Hey, buddy.

266
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:38,388
- Shouldn't steal cars, it's bad.
- It's my car, dumbass!

267
00:17:38,413 --> 00:17:40,120
Hey! Shut that off!

268
00:17:40,261 --> 00:17:42,373
- Can you tell him it's my car?
- I was...

269
00:17:42,398 --> 00:17:44,158
I work at nights. Come on, dude.

270
00:17:44,182 --> 00:17:47,232
- That's not your car! That's his car.
- How was I supposed to know it's his car?

271
00:17:48,151 --> 00:17:50,176
Every day with these damn alarms!
Turn it off!

272
00:17:50,201 --> 00:17:52,896
Don't make me come down there, you punk.

273
00:17:52,921 --> 00:17:55,639
Hey, Gary. How you doing?

274
00:17:55,664 --> 00:17:58,209
Marjorie, how are you? How's your mother?

275
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,746
I'm good, I'm good.

276
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,522
You have reached the voicemail box of...

277
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,004
Happy Hogan.

278
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:13,526
Hey, Happy. Here's my report for tonight.

279
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:17,107
I stopped a grand theft bicycle. Couldn't
find the owner, so I just left a note.

280
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:21,147
I helped this lost, old Dominican lady.

281
00:18:21,297 --> 00:18:23,857
She was really nice and bought me a churro.

282
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,748
I just feel like I could be doing more.

283
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,498
You know? Just curious
when the next real mission's gonna be.

284
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,439
So, yeah, just call me back.

285
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:35,818
It's Peter. Parker.

286
00:18:40,794 --> 00:18:42,709
Why would I tell him about the churro?

287
00:18:47,172 --> 00:18:48,076
Hey, hey.

288
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,389
Okay.

289
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,763
Can't wait to see this thing.

290
00:18:57,776 --> 00:18:59,146
Finally, something good.

291
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,842
Yo, this high-tech stuff makes it too easy.

292
00:19:04,987 --> 00:19:07,240
- Told you it was worth it.
- Okay, go, go, go.

293
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,537
Oh, nice.

294
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:16,068
We can hit, like, five more places tonight.

295
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:29,675
What's up, guys?
You forget your PIN number?

296
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,066
You're the Avengers.

297
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:33,996
What are you guys doing here?

298
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:38,878
Thor. Hulk. Good to finally meet you guys.

299
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,465
I thought you'd be more handsome in person.

300
00:19:41,631 --> 00:19:42,472
Iron Man.

301
00:19:42,497 --> 00:19:45,066
Hey, what are you doing robbing a bank?
You're a billionaire.

302
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,348
Hey...

303
00:19:49,451 --> 00:19:51,443
Oh, this feels so weird.

304
00:19:53,777 --> 00:19:55,214
What is that thing?

305
00:19:55,723 --> 00:19:59,550
I'm starting to think
you're not the Avengers.

306
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:05,735
911. What's your emergency?

307
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:10,499
Spider-Man is fighting the Avengers
in a bank on 21st Street.

308
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:12,597
All right, guys. Let's wrap this up.
It's a school night.

309
00:20:16,733 --> 00:20:18,895
So how do jerks like you
get tech like this?

310
00:20:21,152 --> 00:20:22,402
No. Wait, wait, wait!

311
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:28,714
Mr. Delmar.

312
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:32,124
Hey, Mr. Delmar, you in here?

313
00:20:32,133 --> 00:20:33,902
Is anybody in here? Hello?

314
00:20:42,887 --> 00:20:44,386
Oh, come on.

315
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,081
I gotta...

316
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,865
- Here, here.
- Good, yeah.

317
00:20:52,741 --> 00:20:54,478
Okay. Good. Yes.

318
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:58,304
Yes... No. No, put that down.
That's worth more than you or me.

319
00:20:58,629 --> 00:20:59,358
Yeah?

320
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,250
Happy, the craziest thing
just happened to me.

321
00:21:01,274 --> 00:21:03,203
These guys were robbing an ATM
with these high-tech weapons...

322
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,806
Hey. Take a breath. Okay,
I don't have time for ATM robberies...

323
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:06,909
Yeah, but...

324
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:10,339
...or the notes you leave.
I have moving day to worry about.

325
00:21:10,364 --> 00:21:12,253
Everything's gotta be out next week.

326
00:21:12,534 --> 00:21:15,902
- Wait. You're moving? Who's moving?
- Yeah, don't you watch the news?

327
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,439
Tony sold Avengers Tower. We're
relocating to a new facility upstate,

328
00:21:19,464 --> 00:21:21,632
where hopefully the cell service is worse.

329
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:22,863
But what about me?

330
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,347
What about you?

331
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:28,429
Well, what if Mr. Stark needs me
or something big goes down?

332
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:31,572
- Can I please talk to Mr. Stark?
- Stay away from anything too dangerous.

333
00:21:31,597 --> 00:21:34,558
I'm responsible for making sure
you're responsible, okay?

334
00:21:36,462 --> 00:21:38,875
I am responsible. I... Oh, crap.

335
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:41,609
- My backpack's gone.
- That doesn't sound responsible.

336
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:44,441
- I'll call you back.
- Feel free not to.

337
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:45,970
What was that?

338
00:22:47,257 --> 00:22:49,214
It's nothing. Nothing.

339
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:52,239
You're the Spider-Man. From YouTube.

340
00:22:52,263 --> 00:22:54,204
I'm not. I'm not.

341
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:55,649
- You were on the ceiling.
- No, it wasn't.

342
00:22:55,674 --> 00:22:56,783
Ned, what are you doing in my room?

343
00:22:56,808 --> 00:22:58,813
May let me in.
We were gonna finish the Death Star.

344
00:22:58,838 --> 00:23:00,649
You can't just bust into my room!

345
00:23:00,961 --> 00:23:03,993
That turkey meatloaf recipe is a disaster.

346
00:23:04,018 --> 00:23:05,841
Let's go to dinner. Thai?

347
00:23:05,865 --> 00:23:06,944
Ned, you want Thai?

348
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:08,210
- Yes.
- No. He's got a thing.

349
00:23:08,235 --> 00:23:10,548
A thing to do after.

350
00:23:11,285 --> 00:23:12,548
Okay.

351
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:15,485
Maybe put on some clothes.

352
00:23:17,213 --> 00:23:19,360
- Oh, she doesn't know?
- Nobody knows.

353
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,868
Mr. Stark knows because he made my suit,
but that's it.

354
00:23:21,893 --> 00:23:25,102
Tony Stark made you that?
Are you an Avenger?

355
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:27,904
Yeah, basically.

356
00:23:29,514 --> 00:23:32,382
You can't tell anybody about this.
You gotta keep it a secret.

357
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:34,282
- Secret? Why?
- You know what she's like.

358
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:35,876
If she finds out people try and kill me
every single night,

359
00:23:35,901 --> 00:23:37,642
she's not gonna let me do this anymore.

360
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:38,977
Come on, Ned, please.

361
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:40,709
Okay, okay, okay.

362
00:23:40,963 --> 00:23:42,470
I'll level with you.

363
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:45,610
I can't keep this a secret. It's the
greatest thing that's ever happened to me.

364
00:23:45,635 --> 00:23:48,298
Ned, May cannot know.
I cannot do that to her right now.

365
00:23:48,547 --> 00:23:52,462
You know? I mean, everything
that's happened with her, I... Please.

366
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:55,833
Okay.

367
00:23:55,857 --> 00:23:57,388
Just swear it, okay?

368
00:23:57,892 --> 00:23:58,928
I swear.

369
00:23:58,953 --> 00:24:01,071
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

370
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,185
I can't believe this is happening now.

371
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:04,540
- Can I try the suit on?
- No.

372
00:24:04,565 --> 00:24:06,509
How's it work? Is it magnets?
How do you shoot the strings?

373
00:24:06,534 --> 00:24:08,860
- I'm gonna tell you at school tomorrow.
- Great.

374
00:24:09,015 --> 00:24:10,972
Okay, well, wait, then.

375
00:24:11,173 --> 00:24:14,235
How do you do this
and the Stark internship?

376
00:24:15,581 --> 00:24:17,602
This is the Stark internship.

377
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,907
Just get out of here.

378
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,461
What's the matter?

379
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:27,539
Thought you loved larb.

380
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:29,634
It's too larby?

381
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:32,095
Not larby enough.

382
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:37,516
How many times do I have to say "larb"
before you talk to me?

383
00:24:37,685 --> 00:24:39,243
You know I larb you.

384
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:44,235
I'm just stressed. The internship,
and I'm tired. A lot of work.

385
00:24:44,409 --> 00:24:46,204
The Stark internship.

386
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,524
I have to tell you,
not a fan of that Tony Stark.

387
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:54,900
You're distracted all the time.
He's got you in your head.

388
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:58,048
- Delmar's Sandwiches was destroyed...
- What does he have you doing?

389
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,915
- ...in an explosion earlier tonight...
- You need to use your instincts.

390
00:24:59,957 --> 00:25:03,095
...after an ATM robbery was thwarted by
Queens' own colorful local crime stopper...

391
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,259
What?

392
00:25:04,573 --> 00:25:06,188
...the Spider-Man.

393
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:08,816
As the Spider-Man attempted
to foil their heist,

394
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:12,505
a powerful blast was set off, slicing
through the bodega across the street.

395
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:14,567
Miraculously, no one was harmed.

396
00:25:14,794 --> 00:25:18,602
If you spot something like that happening,
you turn and you run the other way.

397
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:20,876
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.

398
00:25:20,901 --> 00:25:22,282
Six blocks away from us.

399
00:25:22,307 --> 00:25:24,299
I need a new backpack.

400
00:25:25,844 --> 00:25:26,723
What?

401
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:28,188
I-I need a new backpack.

402
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:29,817
That's five.

403
00:25:30,822 --> 00:25:32,110
Sticky rice pudding.

404
00:25:32,138 --> 00:25:33,360
We didn't order that.

405
00:25:33,385 --> 00:25:34,696
It's on the house.

406
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:37,404
Thanks.

407
00:25:39,136 --> 00:25:40,931
That's nice of him.

408
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:43,806
I think he larbs you.

409
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,335
You got bit by a spider?

410
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,817
Can it bite me?

411
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:50,963
Well, it probably would've hurt, right?

412
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:53,554
You know, whatever. Even if it did hurt,
I'd let it bite me.

413
00:25:53,579 --> 00:25:55,320
Maybe. How much did it hurt?

414
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,009
The spider's dead, Ned.

415
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:07,384
You were here?

416
00:26:08,312 --> 00:26:09,563
Yeah.

417
00:26:10,701 --> 00:26:12,423
You could've died.

418
00:26:15,391 --> 00:26:16,927
Do you lay eggs?

419
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,074
What? No.

420
00:26:21,317 --> 00:26:24,105
- Can you spit venom?
- No.

421
00:26:24,215 --> 00:26:26,502
Can you summon an army of spiders?

422
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,000
No, Ned.

423
00:26:28,061 --> 00:26:30,974
The Sokovia Accords were put into place...

424
00:26:31,014 --> 00:26:33,301
How far can you shoot your webs?

425
00:26:33,685 --> 00:26:35,069
It's unknown. Shut up.

426
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,388
...to begin regulating...

427
00:26:36,434 --> 00:26:40,333
If I was you, I would stand on a building
and just shoot it as far as I could-

428
00:26:40,357 --> 00:26:41,884
Shut up, Ned.

429
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,428
Hi. I'm Captain America. Whether you're
in the classroom or on the battlefield...

430
00:26:46,453 --> 00:26:48,337
- Do you know him too?
- Yeah, we met.

431
00:26:48,362 --> 00:26:49,798
...fitness can be the difference
between success or failure.

432
00:26:49,823 --> 00:26:51,251
- I stole his shield.
- What?

433
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:52,618
Today, my good friend,

434
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:57,032
your gym teacher will be conducting
the Captain America Fitness Challenge.

435
00:26:57,284 --> 00:26:58,477
Thank you, Captain.

436
00:26:58,502 --> 00:27:01,743
Pretty sure this guy's a war criminal now,
but I have to show these videos.

437
00:27:01,768 --> 00:27:03,626
It's required by the state. Let's do it.

438
00:27:03,976 --> 00:27:05,467
Do Avengers have to pay taxes?

439
00:27:05,692 --> 00:27:07,308
What does Hulk smell like?

440
00:27:07,524 --> 00:27:09,673
- I bet he smells nice.
- You have to shut up.

441
00:27:09,698 --> 00:27:12,571
Is Captain America cool,
or is he like a mean, old grandpa?

442
00:27:12,596 --> 00:27:14,508
Ned, just... okay?

443
00:27:14,695 --> 00:27:17,302
Hey, can I be your guy in the chair?

444
00:27:17,326 --> 00:27:18,321
What?

445
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:21,115
Yeah. You know how
there's a guy with a headset

446
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,117
telling the other guy where to go?

447
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:26,120
If you're in a burning building,
I could tell you where to go.

448
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,610
There'd be screens around me,
and I could swivel around.

449
00:27:28,635 --> 00:27:29,942
I could be your guy in the chair.

450
00:27:29,966 --> 00:27:31,899
Ned, I don't need a guy in the chair.

451
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,532
Looking good, Parker.

452
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:39,633
Now, see, for me, it would be F Thor,

453
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,662
marry Iron Man and kill Hulk.

454
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:43,534
Well, what about the Spider-Man?

455
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:44,876
It's just Spider-Man.

456
00:27:44,901 --> 00:27:48,227
Did you see the bank security cam
on YouTube? He fought off four guys.

457
00:27:48,252 --> 00:27:50,266
Oh, my God, she's crushing on Spider-Man.

458
00:27:50,298 --> 00:27:51,602
No way.

459
00:27:51,627 --> 00:27:53,664
- Kind of.
- Oh, gross.

460
00:27:54,729 --> 00:27:56,859
- He's probably like 30.
- You don't know what he looks like.

461
00:27:56,884 --> 00:27:59,111
Like, what if he's seriously burned?

462
00:27:59,136 --> 00:28:01,844
I wouldn't care. I'd still love him
for the person he is inside.

463
00:28:01,869 --> 00:28:03,618
Peter knows Spider-Man.

464
00:28:06,669 --> 00:28:09,032
No, I don't. No. I... I mean...

465
00:28:10,016 --> 00:28:11,345
They're friends.

466
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:13,790
Yeah, like Coach Wilson
and Captain America are friends.

467
00:28:14,501 --> 00:28:17,462
I-I've met him, yeah. A couple times.

468
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,048
But it's...

469
00:28:19,694 --> 00:28:21,686
...through the Stark internship.

470
00:28:23,081 --> 00:28:25,494
Yeah, well, I'm not really supposed
to talk about it.

471
00:28:25,566 --> 00:28:27,477
Well, that's awesome. Hey, you know what?

472
00:28:27,502 --> 00:28:29,876
Maybe you should invite him
to Liz's party. Right?

473
00:28:30,118 --> 00:28:33,813
Yeah, I'm having people over tonight.
You're more than welcome to come.

474
00:28:33,930 --> 00:28:36,343
- Having a party?
- Yeah, it's gonna be dope.

475
00:28:36,368 --> 00:28:38,657
You should totally invite
your personal friend Spider-Man.

476
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:40,907
It's okay.

477
00:28:41,345 --> 00:28:44,053
I know Peter's way too busy
for parties anyway, so...

478
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,350
Come on. He'll be there.

479
00:28:45,373 --> 00:28:46,313
Right, Parker?

480
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:53,899
What are you doing?

481
00:28:53,924 --> 00:28:55,415
Helping you out.

482
00:28:55,694 --> 00:28:59,399
Did you not hear her?
Liz has a crush on you.

483
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,593
Dude, you're an Avenger.

484
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:07,845
If any one of us has a chance
with a senior girl, it's you.

485
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:14,436
House party in the suburbs.

486
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,829
Oh, I remember these. Kind of jealous.

487
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,579
It'll be a night to remember.

488
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:23,654
Ned, some hats wear men. You wear that hat.

489
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,376
Yeah, it gives me confidence.

490
00:29:25,806 --> 00:29:27,013
This is a mistake.

491
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,477
Hey, let's just go home.

492
00:29:28,502 --> 00:29:30,170
Oh, Peter.

493
00:29:30,195 --> 00:29:33,118
I know. I know it's really hard

494
00:29:33,143 --> 00:29:36,541
trying to fit in with all the changes
your body's going through.

495
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:37,837
It's flowering now.

496
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,853
He's so stressed out lately.

497
00:29:41,878 --> 00:29:43,757
What helps with stress
is going to a party.

498
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,220
- We should go to the party.
- Yeah, let's do it. I'm gonna go.

499
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:49,446
Peter.

500
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:51,739
Have fun, okay? Okay.

501
00:29:51,763 --> 00:29:52,813
I will.

502
00:29:52,838 --> 00:29:54,141
Bye, May.

503
00:29:56,534 --> 00:29:58,376
Dude, you have the suit, right?

504
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:01,188
This is gonna change our lives.

505
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:08,008
- Annie, over here!
- Hey.

506
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,342
Hey.

507
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,344
DJ Flash.

508
00:30:15,272 --> 00:30:17,624
Okay. We're gonna have
Spider-Man swing in,

509
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:21,688
say you guys are tight, and I get
a fist bump or one of those half bro-hugs.

510
00:30:21,713 --> 00:30:23,830
Can't believe you're at this lame party.

511
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,279
But you're here too.

512
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,727
Am I?

513
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,781
Oh, my gosh.

514
00:30:31,806 --> 00:30:32,817
Hey, guys.

515
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:33,890
Cool hat, Ned.

516
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,656
- Hi, Liz.
- Hi, Liz.

517
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,853
I'm so happy you guys came.

518
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:40,370
There's pizza and drinks. Help yourself.

519
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:43,727
- What a great party.
- Thanks.

520
00:30:46,503 --> 00:30:47,744
Oh, I...

521
00:30:47,769 --> 00:30:50,485
My parents will kill me
if anything's broken. I gotta...

522
00:30:50,517 --> 00:30:52,367
- Yeah.
- Have fun.

523
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,071
- Bye.
- Bye.

524
00:30:54,355 --> 00:30:56,454
Dude, what are you doing?

525
00:30:56,586 --> 00:30:58,669
She's here. Spider it up.

526
00:30:58,869 --> 00:31:01,532
No, no, no. I can't... I cannot do this.

527
00:31:01,557 --> 00:31:03,938
Spider-Man is not a party trick, okay?

528
00:31:04,154 --> 00:31:06,817
Look, I'm just gonna be myself.

529
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,281
Peter, no one wants that.

530
00:31:09,573 --> 00:31:11,087
Dude.

531
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:14,533
Penis Parker, what's up?

532
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,683
So where's your pal Spider-Man?

533
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,246
Let me guess: In Canada with
your imaginary girlfriend?

534
00:31:20,915 --> 00:31:24,329
That's not Spider-Man.
That's just Ned in a red shirt.

535
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,743
"Hey, what's up? I'm Spider-Man.

536
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:37,884
Just thought I'd swing by
and say hello to my buddy Peter.

537
00:31:37,909 --> 00:31:41,290
Oh, what's up, Ned? Hey, where's Peter,
anyways? He must be around..."

538
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:49,564
God, this is stupid. What am I doing?

539
00:31:58,667 --> 00:31:59,783
What the hell?

540
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:22,350
This sucks.

541
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:32,050
Now, this is crafted from a reclaimed
sub-Ultron arm straight from Sokovia.

542
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:33,361
Here. You try.

543
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:38,473
I wanted something low-key.
Why are you trying to upsell me, man?

544
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,581
Okay, okay. I got what you need, all right?

545
00:32:40,606 --> 00:32:43,579
I got tons of great stuff here. One sec.

546
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:48,886
Okay, I got black hole grenades,
Chitauri railguns...

547
00:32:48,911 --> 00:32:51,051
You letting off shots in public now?
Hurry up.

548
00:32:51,076 --> 00:32:54,695
Look, times are changing. We're the
only ones selling these high-tech weapons.

549
00:32:55,647 --> 00:32:58,165
This must be
where the ATM robbers got their stuff.

550
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:02,868
I need something to stick up somebody.
I'm not trying to shoot them back in time.

551
00:33:02,893 --> 00:33:05,212
I got antigrav climbers.

552
00:33:05,237 --> 00:33:06,318
Yo, climbers?

553
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:10,190
Okay, what the hell is that?

554
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,364
- Did you set us up?
- Hey, hey, man.

555
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:20,079
Hey! Hey, come on.
You gonna shoot at somebody, shoot at me.

556
00:33:20,795 --> 00:33:21,911
All right.

557
00:33:34,513 --> 00:33:36,110
What was that?

558
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,779
We gotta call him.

559
00:33:48,823 --> 00:33:50,358
No, no, no.

560
00:33:56,437 --> 00:33:59,198
- Did you just do it again?
- Shut up.

561
00:33:59,222 --> 00:34:00,444
I'm calling him.

562
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,037
Toomes's phone.

563
00:34:12,201 --> 00:34:13,537
Boss.

564
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,168
Oh, my butt!

565
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:37,186
Great.
Guess I'm gonna have to take a shortcut.

566
00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:42,316
Hey, guys. Good game. Have fun.

567
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:44,739
Hey, hey, buddy.

568
00:34:44,923 --> 00:34:47,202
Sorry, no time to play. Here, go fetch.

569
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:51,397
Now, this is more like it.

570
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,551
Smells really good.

571
00:35:09,153 --> 00:35:10,647
Great movie!

572
00:35:16,486 --> 00:35:18,068
Oh, hey, guys.

573
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:20,608
No! No!

574
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,522
Hey, it's Peter. Leave a message.

575
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:26,057
Peter, where are you?

576
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:28,014
The hat's not working. This is not cool.

577
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:30,491
Almost got you.

578
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:44,850
Thought you got away from me, didn't you?

579
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,998
I got you right where I want you.

580
00:35:48,831 --> 00:35:50,037
Surprise!

581
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:55,381
What the hell?

582
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:44,373
Oh, hey.

583
00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:51,178
And then he just, like,
swooped down like a monster

584
00:36:51,203 --> 00:36:55,116
and picked me up, and took me up
like a thousand feet and just dropped me.

585
00:36:55,672 --> 00:36:58,164
How'd you find me?
Did you put a tracker in my suit?

586
00:36:58,189 --> 00:37:00,021
I put everything in your suit.

587
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,725
Including this heater.

588
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:06,905
That's better. Thanks.

589
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:08,780
What were you thinking?

590
00:37:08,805 --> 00:37:12,288
The guy with wings is the source
of the weapons. I gotta take him down.

591
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,124
Take him down now, huh?

592
00:37:14,151 --> 00:37:16,939
Steady, Crockett, there are people
who handle this sort of thing.

593
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,042
The Avengers?

594
00:37:18,066 --> 00:37:20,088
No, no, no.
This is a little below their pay grade.

595
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:21,209
Anyway, Mr. Stark,

596
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,785
you didn't have to come all the way
out here. I had that. I was fine.

597
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:26,631
Oh, I'm not here.

598
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:32,016
Thank God this place has Wi-Fi
or you would be toast right now.

599
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,448
Thank Ganesh while you're at it.

600
00:37:33,472 --> 00:37:34,475
Cheers.

601
00:37:35,081 --> 00:37:37,436
Look, forget the flying vulture guy,
please.

602
00:37:37,461 --> 00:37:38,625
- Why?
- Why?

603
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:40,147
Because I said so!

604
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:43,491
Sorry, I'm talking to a teenager.

605
00:37:43,968 --> 00:37:45,780
Stay close to the ground.

606
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:49,905
Build up your game helping little people,
like that lady that bought you the churro.

607
00:37:50,328 --> 00:37:52,811
Can't you just be a friendly...

608
00:37:53,943 --> 00:37:55,540
...neighborhood Spider-Man?

609
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:57,373
But I'm ready for more than that now.

610
00:37:57,869 --> 00:37:58,905
No, you're not.

611
00:37:58,946 --> 00:38:01,233
That is not what you thought
when I took on Captain America.

612
00:38:01,258 --> 00:38:04,037
Trust me, kid. If Cap wanted
to lay you out, he would've.

613
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:08,373
Listen to me. If you come across
these weapons again, call Happy.

614
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:10,619
Are you driving?

615
00:38:10,644 --> 00:38:13,764
You know, it's never too early
to start thinking about college.

616
00:38:13,789 --> 00:38:15,530
I got some pull at MIT. End call.

617
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,581
No, I don't need to go to-

618
00:38:18,606 --> 00:38:20,553
Mr. Stark is no longer connected.

619
00:38:23,447 --> 00:38:24,827
That's awesome.

620
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,889
"Stay close to the ground"?
What is he talking about?

621
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:52,153
Hey, man, what's up? I'm on my way back.

622
00:38:52,178 --> 00:38:55,475
Actually, I was calling to say
maybe you shouldn't come. Listen to this.

623
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,873
When I say "penis", you say "Parker".

624
00:38:57,898 --> 00:38:59,229
- Penis!
- Parker!

625
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,461
- Penis!
- Parker!

626
00:39:00,964 --> 00:39:03,358
Sorry, Peter. I guess we're still losers.

627
00:39:03,383 --> 00:39:05,795
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- I'll see you tomorrow in school.

628
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:47,537
Idiots.

629
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,003
Idiots.

630
00:39:50,028 --> 00:39:51,061
Idiots!

631
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:53,593
Boss?

632
00:39:53,816 --> 00:39:57,389
Your wife keeps texting you.
Something about a brake light.

633
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,420
What'd I tell you
about looking at my phone?

634
00:39:59,793 --> 00:40:01,374
Sorry. You left it out.

635
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,350
You know I'm a curious person by nature.

636
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:08,192
I finished designing
that high-altitude vacuum seal.

637
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,525
In case you want to,
you know, go for the big one?

638
00:40:12,608 --> 00:40:16,449
You're still on that? I told you, no.
The answer's no. Forget it.

639
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:29,991
I mean, that was badass.

640
00:40:33,205 --> 00:40:37,074
How many times have I told you
not to fire them out in the open?

641
00:40:37,099 --> 00:40:38,854
You said, move the merchandise.

642
00:40:38,878 --> 00:40:39,954
Under the radar.

643
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,186
Under the radar!

644
00:40:41,211 --> 00:40:42,952
That's how we survive.

645
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:46,905
If you bring Damage Control
or the Avengers down here, we're through.

646
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:50,311
You're out there wearing that goofy thing,
lighting up cars,

647
00:40:50,336 --> 00:40:52,008
calling yourself the Shocker.

648
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:55,151
"I'm the Shocker. I shock people."
What is this, pro wrestling?

649
00:40:55,176 --> 00:40:57,077
Whatever, old man. Come on.

650
00:40:58,463 --> 00:40:59,702
Look.

651
00:41:00,018 --> 00:41:01,217
Look.

652
00:41:01,587 --> 00:41:05,881
I know you don't give a crap
about anything. But I do.

653
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:09,499
I built this whole place
because I got people I have to look after.

654
00:41:09,524 --> 00:41:11,787
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

655
00:41:14,951 --> 00:41:18,787
You know what?
I can't afford your bullshit.

656
00:41:19,536 --> 00:41:21,162
- Get out of here.
- What?

657
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,706
You're done. You're off the crew.

658
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,217
Yeah, all right.

659
00:41:25,303 --> 00:41:26,542
All right.

660
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:30,592
Wonder if you can afford me out there,
though, right? With everything I know.

661
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:33,073
Excuse me?

662
00:41:33,733 --> 00:41:35,069
I'm just saying

663
00:41:35,078 --> 00:41:38,217
maybe your wife would like to know
where you really get your money from.

664
00:41:39,494 --> 00:41:41,217
- You know what?
- What?

665
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:42,680
You're right.

666
00:41:42,705 --> 00:41:44,327
- That work?
- I don't know.

667
00:41:45,607 --> 00:41:47,143
I can't afford that.

668
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:49,412
Wait.

669
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:57,834
Damn.

670
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:03,162
- I thought this was the antigravity gun.
- What?

671
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,268
No, that's that one.

672
00:42:17,744 --> 00:42:18,780
Here.

673
00:42:19,821 --> 00:42:23,662
Now you're the Shocker.
Go out there and find that weapon he lost.

674
00:42:24,125 --> 00:42:25,161
All right.

675
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:36,381
Hey, thanks for bailing on me.

676
00:42:36,406 --> 00:42:38,363
Yeah, well, something came up.

677
00:42:38,509 --> 00:42:39,716
What is that?

678
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:42,994
I don't know.
Some guy tried to vaporize me with it.

679
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:44,620
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

680
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:45,780
Awesome.

681
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:49,356
I mean, not awesome.
Totally uncool of that guy.

682
00:42:49,381 --> 00:42:50,795
So scary.

683
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:55,967
Well, look, I think it's... a power source.

684
00:42:55,992 --> 00:42:58,843
Yeah, but it's connected to
all these microprocessors.

685
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:02,077
That's an inductive charging plate.
That's what I use to charge my toothbrush.

686
00:43:02,102 --> 00:43:05,373
Whoever's making these weapons is
combining alien tech with ours.

687
00:43:05,398 --> 00:43:09,319
That is literally the coolest sentence
anyone has ever said.

688
00:43:09,344 --> 00:43:14,428
I just want to thank you for letting me be
part of your journey into this amazing-

689
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:20,716
Keep your fingers clear of the blades.

690
00:43:22,935 --> 00:43:25,052
I gotta figure out what this is
and who makes it.

691
00:43:25,077 --> 00:43:27,240
We'll go to the lab after class
and run some tests.

692
00:43:27,265 --> 00:43:28,209
Let's do it.

693
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,716
First, I say we put the glowy thing
in the mass spectrometer.

694
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:41,344
First, we gotta come up with a better name
than "glowy thingy".

695
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:42,450
You're right.

696
00:43:43,767 --> 00:43:44,883
Crap.

697
00:43:45,674 --> 00:43:47,131
Come on, come on, come on.

698
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:53,374
High schools creep me out.

699
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:56,047
They got this funny smell, you know?

700
00:43:56,302 --> 00:43:58,589
Hey, that's one of the guys
that tried to kill me.

701
00:43:58,614 --> 00:43:59,650
What?

702
00:43:59,848 --> 00:44:01,428
- Yeah.
- We gotta get out of here.

703
00:44:01,453 --> 00:44:03,574
No, no, no. I gotta follow them.

704
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,182
They can lead me to the guy
that dropped me in the lake.

705
00:44:06,207 --> 00:44:08,449
- Someone dropped you in a lake?
- Yeah, it was not good.

706
00:44:10,371 --> 00:44:11,912
- Peter...
- No. Stay there, Ned.

707
00:44:12,121 --> 00:44:13,365
Peter.

708
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,065
What are you doing?

709
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:19,331
Nothing.

710
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,819
Yeah. You good?

711
00:44:22,031 --> 00:44:23,067
Chess.

712
00:44:25,723 --> 00:44:28,826
Man, can you imagine what the boss
would say if he knew where we were?

713
00:44:29,451 --> 00:44:31,740
It's saying
there was an energy pulse right here.

714
00:44:31,765 --> 00:44:35,541
There's no sign of the weapon.
And even if it was here, now it's gone.

715
00:44:35,565 --> 00:44:36,647
So are we.

716
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:11,522
This is so awesome.

717
00:45:12,005 --> 00:45:13,490
I know, right?

718
00:45:17,022 --> 00:45:18,592
They're in Brooklyn.

719
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,803
Staten Island.

720
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:32,308
Leaving Jersey.

721
00:45:40,063 --> 00:45:41,540
They stopped.

722
00:45:44,659 --> 00:45:45,740
Maryland?

723
00:45:45,765 --> 00:45:46,841
What's there?

724
00:45:46,865 --> 00:45:49,365
I don't know. Evil lair?

725
00:45:49,845 --> 00:45:50,598
They have a lair?

726
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:54,060
Dude, a gang with alien guns run by
a guy with wings? Yeah They have a lair.

727
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:55,645
Badass.

728
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:58,538
But how are you gonna get there
if it's, like, 300 miles away?

729
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,813
It's not too far from D.C.

730
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,738
- Hey, it's Peter.
- Guys.

731
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:06,799
- Peter?
- Hey, buddy.

732
00:46:06,824 --> 00:46:08,991
I was hoping I could rejoin the team.

733
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:13,273
No, no way. You can't quit on us, stroll up
and be welcomed back by everyone.

734
00:46:13,298 --> 00:46:14,649
Hey, welcome back, Peter!

735
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:16,610
Flash, you're back to first alternate.

736
00:46:16,635 --> 00:46:18,125
- What?
- He's taking your place.

737
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,516
Excuse me, can we go already?

738
00:46:19,541 --> 00:46:23,330
I was hoping to get in some protesting
in front of an embassy before dinner.

739
00:46:23,562 --> 00:46:26,196
Protesting is patriotic.
Let's get on the bus.

740
00:46:28,077 --> 00:46:31,366
Focus up, everyone.
Our next topic is the moons of Saturn.

741
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:33,649
The second law of thermodynamics.

742
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:34,860
Frank Sinatra.

743
00:46:35,169 --> 00:46:36,234
Fort Sumter.

744
00:46:36,485 --> 00:46:37,520
Flash is wrong.

745
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:39,049
Okay, guys, let's focus. Next one.

746
00:46:39,091 --> 00:46:40,321
Liz, don't overwork them.

747
00:46:40,853 --> 00:46:42,688
Strontium, barium, vibranium.

748
00:46:42,713 --> 00:46:44,759
Very good, Peter. Glad to have you back.

749
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:46,301
Glad to be back.

750
00:46:47,029 --> 00:46:48,857
What is the current standard unit of-

751
00:46:48,881 --> 00:46:51,165
- Can I take this real quick?
- Yeah, fine.

752
00:46:51,945 --> 00:46:52,785
Hello?

753
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:55,121
Got a blip on my screen here.
You left New York?

754
00:46:55,146 --> 00:46:56,642
- Okay, focus up, everyone.
- Tracker.

755
00:46:56,667 --> 00:46:59,095
Yeah, no, it's just a school trip.
It's nothing.

756
00:46:59,108 --> 00:47:00,548
Look, Happy, I gotta say,

757
00:47:00,573 --> 00:47:03,720
you tracking me without my permission
is a complete violation of privacy.

758
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:05,284
That's different.

759
00:47:05,302 --> 00:47:06,112
What's different?

760
00:47:06,137 --> 00:47:08,665
Nothing. Look,
it's just the Academic Decathlon.

761
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:09,610
It's no big deal.

762
00:47:09,635 --> 00:47:11,974
Hey, hey. I'll decide if it's no big deal.

763
00:47:14,204 --> 00:47:16,821
Sounds like no big deal,
but remember, I'm watching you.

764
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:30,329
- Everyone stick together.
- Yeah.

765
00:47:31,101 --> 00:47:34,298
- You kidding me? This place is huge.
- I've seen bigger.

766
00:47:34,326 --> 00:47:35,953
There's a bird in here.

767
00:47:35,978 --> 00:47:38,087
Hey, you brought your laptop, right?

768
00:47:38,381 --> 00:47:39,290
Why?

769
00:47:47,093 --> 00:47:51,446
Peter... why are we removing
the tracker from your suit?

770
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:56,599
Because I gotta follow these guys
to their boss before they move again

771
00:47:56,624 --> 00:47:59,583
and I don't really want
Mr. Stark to know about it.

772
00:47:59,608 --> 00:48:01,626
So you're lying to Iron Man now?

773
00:48:01,651 --> 00:48:05,274
No, I'm not lying. He just doesn't
really get what I can do yet.

774
00:48:10,763 --> 00:48:12,188
Gotcha.

775
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:16,596
All right, Happy, enjoy tracking this lamp.

776
00:48:19,203 --> 00:48:22,241
There's a ton of other subsystems
in here...

777
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:26,394
...but they're all disabled by
the Training Wheels Protocol.

778
00:48:26,573 --> 00:48:27,689
What?

779
00:48:27,714 --> 00:48:29,618
"Training Wheels Protocol"?

780
00:48:30,388 --> 00:48:31,333
Turn it off.

781
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:34,876
I don't think that's a good idea.
They're blocked for a reason.

782
00:48:34,901 --> 00:48:37,473
Come on, man, I don't need training wheels.

783
00:48:37,498 --> 00:48:40,899
I'm sick of him treating me like
a kid all the time. It's not cool.

784
00:48:40,923 --> 00:48:42,192
But you are a kid.

785
00:48:42,217 --> 00:48:44,551
Yeah, a kid who can stop a bus
with his bare hands.

786
00:48:44,576 --> 00:48:48,340
Peter, I just don't think this is a great
idea. I mean, what if this is illegal?

787
00:48:48,365 --> 00:48:51,434
Look, please.
This is my chance to prove myself.

788
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:53,545
I can handle it. Ned, come on.

789
00:48:53,570 --> 00:48:55,360
I don't think this is a good idea.

790
00:48:55,384 --> 00:48:56,520
The guy in the chair.

791
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:58,133
Don't do that.

792
00:48:58,157 --> 00:48:59,192
Come on.

793
00:49:13,307 --> 00:49:15,493
The glowy thing, it's evidence.
Keep it safe. All right?

794
00:49:15,517 --> 00:49:16,826
Okay. Okay.

795
00:49:18,448 --> 00:49:20,176
- They're moving.
- Be careful.

796
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,840
- Hey, Liz.
- Perfect timing.

797
00:49:26,172 --> 00:49:27,440
We're gonna go swimming.

798
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:29,127
- Come on, come on, come on.
- What?

799
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,541
- Hey, Peter.
- Hi.

800
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,278
Hey.

801
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:39,160
I was... I was gonna go study in
the business center.

802
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:41,648
You don't need to study.
You're the smartest guy I've ever met.

803
00:49:41,673 --> 00:49:42,959
And besides...

804
00:49:43,637 --> 00:49:46,965
...a rebellious group activity the day
before competition is good for morale.

805
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,485
Well, I read that in a TED Talk, so...

806
00:49:50,510 --> 00:49:52,752
I... I heard it in a TED Talk.

807
00:49:52,924 --> 00:49:54,836
And I read a coaching book.

808
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,223
You really...
This is really important to you.

809
00:49:58,248 --> 00:50:01,783
Yeah. It's our future.
I'm not gonna screw it up.

810
00:50:02,762 --> 00:50:06,551
Besides, we raided the minibar
and these candy bars were, like, $11.

811
00:50:06,879 --> 00:50:09,746
- So get your trunks on and come on.
- Come on.

812
00:50:10,229 --> 00:50:12,346
- Come on.
- I'm coming, I'm coming.

813
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:13,629
Let's go.

814
00:50:37,441 --> 00:50:39,929
- Good evening, Peter.
- Hello? Hello?

815
00:50:39,954 --> 00:50:43,015
Congratulations on completing
the rigorous Training Wheels Protocol

816
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,853
and gaining access to
your suit's full capabilities.

817
00:50:46,017 --> 00:50:47,333
Thank you.

818
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:49,335
So where would you like to take me tonight?

819
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:52,358
I put a tracker on someone. He's a bad guy.

820
00:50:52,383 --> 00:50:53,916
Tracker located.

821
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,127
Plotting course to intercept target.

822
00:50:57,152 --> 00:51:00,236
Okay. Well, as long as I make it back
in time for decathlon, it's fine.

823
00:51:08,211 --> 00:51:10,919
One hundred meters from
destination and closing.

824
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:12,749
Jump now.

825
00:51:17,249 --> 00:51:19,319
Detecting three individuals.

826
00:51:20,512 --> 00:51:23,926
Why is their secret lair in a gas station?
That's so lame.

827
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:29,827
Hey, suit lady, what are they doing?

828
00:51:29,852 --> 00:51:31,355
Do you want to hear what they're saying?

829
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,838
I can hear what they're saying? Yeah.

830
00:51:33,938 --> 00:51:36,068
Activating Enhanced Reconnaissance Mode.

831
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:39,006
I got the gauntlet from the Lagos cleanup.
The rest is my design.

832
00:51:39,031 --> 00:51:40,511
Whoa, that's so cool.

833
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,644
Can't believe they're still cleaning up
that Triskelion mess.

834
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:46,277
I love it. They keep making messes,
we keep getting rich.

835
00:51:46,301 --> 00:51:47,327
Target inbound.

836
00:51:47,352 --> 00:51:51,500
They're in the middle of a heist. I could
catch them red-handed. This is awesome.

837
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,961
Okay, I'll get closer
to see what's happening.

838
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:56,694
Would you like me
to engage Enhanced Combat Mode?

839
00:51:56,719 --> 00:51:59,341
"Enhanced Combat Mode"? Yeah.

840
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,823
Activating Instant Kill.

841
00:52:00,848 --> 00:52:03,220
No, no, no. I don't want to kill anybody.

842
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:05,452
Deactivating Instant Kill.

843
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,796
Did you hear that?

844
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:12,771
What the hell just happened? What was that?

845
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:15,140
You jumped off the sign
and landed on your face.

846
00:52:17,488 --> 00:52:19,077
Suit lady,
what's wrong with my web-shooters?

847
00:52:19,102 --> 00:52:21,585
Rapid-fire is the default for
Enhanced Combat Mode.

848
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:24,318
- Why would I need rapid-fire?
- Would you like to see more options?

849
00:52:24,586 --> 00:52:27,741
You have 576 possible
web-shooter combinations.

850
00:52:27,968 --> 00:52:29,491
Mr. Stark really overdid it.

851
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:30,929
You two wait right here.

852
00:52:30,954 --> 00:52:34,960
Wait. You're gonna want to turn on the
dampers. That thing will shatter your arm.

853
00:52:35,155 --> 00:52:36,757
All right, where's the dampers?

854
00:52:36,782 --> 00:52:38,444
- That one.
- Great choice.

855
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:41,007
Would you like me to set this
as your new default?

856
00:52:42,558 --> 00:52:43,452
No, no, no.

857
00:52:43,485 --> 00:52:44,624
- Push that in.
- Right here?

858
00:52:44,649 --> 00:52:45,616
- No, the other...
- This one here?

859
00:52:45,624 --> 00:52:46,514
Yeah. Push that in.

860
00:52:46,539 --> 00:52:48,897
- What was that?
- Taser webs.

861
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,143
Taser webs? I don't want Taser webs.

862
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:53,660
You seem to be unfamiliar with
your web-shooter settings.

863
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,022
Would you like to run a refresher course?

864
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:58,380
- No. Just... You choose.
- Sure thing.

865
00:52:58,405 --> 00:53:01,307
Six-alpha-niner, are you running on time?

866
00:53:01,332 --> 00:53:04,791
Copy, central. Six-alpha-niner on schedule.

867
00:53:07,589 --> 00:53:09,546
- I got a visual.
- Green light, green light.

868
00:53:14,108 --> 00:53:15,394
Oh, that's him.

869
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:21,340
Okay. I got eyes on the convoy.

870
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:22,983
Pulling in behind the caboose.

871
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:25,702
Deploy anchors.

872
00:53:36,344 --> 00:53:37,676
Dropping down.

873
00:53:40,272 --> 00:53:42,374
No outgoing distress signals.
You're all clear.

874
00:53:44,119 --> 00:53:46,960
Hey. Looks like
they got some good stuff here.

875
00:53:56,022 --> 00:53:58,687
Cool. It's like some kind of
matter phase shifter.

876
00:54:03,394 --> 00:54:05,306
All right, coming up.

877
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:12,823
Hey, Big Bird. This doesn't belong to you.

878
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:15,202
Oh, God.

879
00:54:22,152 --> 00:54:24,644
- Suit lady, what was that?!
- You told me to choose.

880
00:54:25,827 --> 00:54:28,365
What?
No, just set everything back to normal.

881
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:30,886
Activating all systems.

882
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:48,866
My head.

883
00:54:48,891 --> 00:54:51,319
You appear to have a mild concussion.

884
00:54:54,006 --> 00:54:56,968
Hey, so where am I right now?

885
00:54:57,273 --> 00:54:58,389
I'm not sure.

886
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:01,166
The container walls
are hindering my sensors.

887
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:04,359
Wait a minute.

888
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:07,343
They must have hijacked the truck
and taken me to their evil lair.

889
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:11,624
Okay, suit lady, we're gonna have to
fight our way out of this one.

890
00:55:12,226 --> 00:55:14,241
Three, two, one.

891
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:22,364
What is this place?

892
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:24,087
Suit lady, where am I?

893
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:27,049
You're in the most secure facility on
the eastern seaboard.

894
00:55:27,074 --> 00:55:28,781
The Damage Control deep storage vault.

895
00:55:28,806 --> 00:55:31,012
No. Seriously?

896
00:55:34,185 --> 00:55:36,934
The door will most likely remain closed
until morning.

897
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:38,245
Morning?

898
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:43,504
Hey, suit lady. I kind of feel bad
calling you "suit lady", you know?

899
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:46,109
I think I should probably give you a name.

900
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:48,467
Like Liz. No, no, no.

901
00:55:48,492 --> 00:55:50,484
God, that's... That's weird.

902
00:55:50,594 --> 00:55:52,832
What about Karen?

903
00:55:53,584 --> 00:55:55,416
You can call me Karen if you would like.

904
00:55:55,441 --> 00:55:58,114
Hey, Karen, what else can this suit do?

905
00:55:59,569 --> 00:56:00,730
What?

906
00:56:00,755 --> 00:56:03,004
Maybe we should run that refresher course.

907
00:56:03,029 --> 00:56:04,926
- Ricochet web.
- Ricochet web.

908
00:56:05,404 --> 00:56:06,446
Cool.

909
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:07,879
Splitter web.

910
00:56:09,417 --> 00:56:11,965
- Web grenade.
- Web grenade!

911
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,742
Should I tell Liz that I'm Spider-Man?

912
00:56:16,767 --> 00:56:18,100
Who is Liz?

913
00:56:18,125 --> 00:56:20,645
Who's Liz? She's...

914
00:56:20,961 --> 00:56:22,563
She's the best. She's awesome.

915
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:26,407
She's just a girl who goes to my school.
And...

916
00:56:26,675 --> 00:56:30,737
Yeah, I just... I really want to tell her,
but it's kind of weird, you know?

917
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:33,971
"Hey, I'm Spider-Man."

918
00:56:33,996 --> 00:56:35,409
What's weird about that?

919
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:37,471
What if she's expecting
someone like Tony Stark?

920
00:56:37,496 --> 00:56:39,788
Imagine how disappointed she'd be
when she sees me.

921
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:43,500
Well, if I were her,
I wouldn't be disappointed at all.

922
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,016
Thanks, Karen.

923
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:47,700
It's really nice
to have somebody to talk to.

924
00:56:48,074 --> 00:56:49,906
Hey, how long we been here anyways?

925
00:56:49,931 --> 00:56:51,797
- Thirty-seven minutes.
- What?!

926
00:56:51,955 --> 00:56:54,011
Thirty-seven minutes? That's insane.

927
00:56:54,036 --> 00:56:57,543
I cannot take this anymore.
I got to... I gotta get out of here.

928
00:56:59,562 --> 00:57:02,223
There's got to be something in here
I can use.

929
00:57:02,924 --> 00:57:04,559
Okay, let's see.

930
00:57:05,328 --> 00:57:06,793
Nope.

931
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:09,364
That's awesome.

932
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,551
Hey, it's like the glowy thing.

933
00:57:12,576 --> 00:57:15,387
That glowy thing is
an explosive Chitauri energy core.

934
00:57:15,844 --> 00:57:17,836
You mean,
we've been carrying around a bomb?

935
00:57:17,861 --> 00:57:21,571
It would require radiation to transform it
into an explosive state.

936
00:57:22,413 --> 00:57:23,770
No, no, no.

937
00:57:28,135 --> 00:57:31,381
Hey! Please!
Please, somebody let me out! Hey!

938
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:33,582
Karen, you have to help me override
that time lock.

939
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:36,219
Okay, Karen, lower the voltage and run it.

940
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:37,735
Trial unsuccessful.

941
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,567
Okay, we're just gonna have
to try every sequence.

942
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:45,973
Ned, Peter, we're gonna be late.
Come on, let's go.

943
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:48,364
Okay. Hold on, hold on.

944
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:55,356
Initiating trial 247.

945
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:57,547
It worked. It works.

946
00:58:09,885 --> 00:58:13,757
Please be sure
all cell phones are turned off.

947
00:58:13,782 --> 00:58:14,818
Thank you.

948
00:58:14,843 --> 00:58:17,010
Karen, you have to get me to
decathlon as fast as possible.

949
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,303
Sure thing. Just tell me where it is.

950
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,104
Right across the street
from the Washington Monument.

951
00:58:20,122 --> 00:58:21,168
It's Ned. Leave a message.

952
00:58:21,202 --> 00:58:23,205
Ned, call me back.
The glowy thing's a bomb!

953
00:58:28,521 --> 00:58:30,518
There's a vehicle approaching
on your right.

954
00:58:31,070 --> 00:58:33,361
We have now entered sudden death.

955
00:58:33,386 --> 00:58:36,314
The next correct answer
wins the championship.

956
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,502
Midtown Tech?

957
00:58:42,681 --> 00:58:43,775
Zero.

958
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:45,682
That is correct.

959
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:48,541
Midtown takes the championship.

960
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:52,299
- We won.
- You guys, I am so proud of you.

961
00:58:52,324 --> 00:58:53,639
Told you we didn't need Peter.

962
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:55,525
Flash, you didn't answer a single question.

963
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:58,629
- Taking it all in, Michelle?
- Oh, yeah, I just...

964
00:58:58,814 --> 00:59:01,346
I don't want to celebrate something
that was built by slaves.

965
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,829
I'm sure the Washington Monument
wasn't built by...

966
00:59:07,294 --> 00:59:08,330
Okay.

967
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:11,088
- Enjoy your book.
- Thanks.

968
00:59:13,508 --> 00:59:15,955
- Oh, Ned, you're alive.
- Peter, are you okay?

969
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:17,738
Ned, where's the glowy thing?
The glowy thing?

970
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:19,311
Don't worry, it's safe.
It's in my backpack.

971
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:21,756
No, Ned.
Listen, the glowy thing is dangerous.

972
00:59:21,781 --> 00:59:23,264
You missed the decathlon.
I covered for you.

973
00:59:23,289 --> 00:59:25,495
- Ned, listen to me.
- We're at the Washington Monument...

974
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:27,039
- Peter, is that you?
- Hey, Liz.

975
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:28,623
- Is that Liz?
- Put Ned back on the phone.

976
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:31,918
- You should tell her how you feel.
- You flake. You are so lucky we won.

977
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:35,527
I want to be mad, but I'm more worried.
Like, what is going on with you?

978
00:59:35,552 --> 00:59:37,340
Liz, I have to talk to Ned.
It's really important.

979
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:38,530
Miss, all items on the belt, please.

980
00:59:38,554 --> 00:59:40,131
Liz, there's something in Ned's backpack.
It's really dangerous.

981
00:59:40,155 --> 00:59:41,868
Don't let it go through x-ray.

982
00:59:44,727 --> 00:59:46,979
Liz? Liz! Damn it.

983
00:59:50,305 --> 00:59:52,791
Hey, Mr. Harrington.Can I be the one
to tell Peter he's expelled?

984
00:59:56,968 --> 01:00:02,714
The Washington Monument is 555 feet,
five and one-eighth inches tall.

985
01:00:04,311 --> 01:00:07,627
Notice how the marble and granite
are cut around the stone.

986
01:00:14,910 --> 01:00:17,323
No, no, no.
Karen, what's going on up there?

987
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:19,874
The Chitauri core has detonated

988
01:00:19,896 --> 01:00:22,135
and caused severe structural damage
to the elevator.

989
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,512
- Oh, no.
- My friends are up there.

990
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:24,123
What?

991
01:00:24,147 --> 01:00:26,075
Don't worry, ma'am,
everything's gonna be okay.

992
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:27,615
Excuse me, excuse me.

993
01:00:27,639 --> 01:00:28,783
Oh, my God, that's tall.

994
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:36,066
Oh, my God. Look at the ceiling.

995
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:37,582
Just stay calm, everyone.

996
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,421
Oh, we are all going to die here.

997
01:00:42,055 --> 01:00:44,866
Estimating 10 minutes
before catastrophic failure.

998
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:46,010
We're freaking screwed.

999
01:00:46,021 --> 01:00:49,611
Okay, guys, I know that was scary,
but our safety systems are working.

1000
01:00:49,636 --> 01:00:52,166
The safety systems are completely failing.

1001
01:00:52,191 --> 01:00:53,853
We're very safe in here.

1002
01:00:53,878 --> 01:00:56,604
The occupants
are in imminent mortal danger.

1003
01:00:56,629 --> 01:00:58,109
I'm going as fast as I can!

1004
01:01:07,674 --> 01:01:09,117
- Let's go.
- Give me your hand.

1005
01:01:10,411 --> 01:01:13,019
You now have 125 seconds
until catastrophic failure.

1006
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:14,492
What?! Why?

1007
01:01:14,517 --> 01:01:17,510
Unexpected motion has caused
the deterioration to escalate.

1008
01:01:17,694 --> 01:01:20,765
- How do I get in there?
- Activating reconnaissance drone.

1009
01:01:23,698 --> 01:01:26,171
Has that been there this whole time?
That's awesome.

1010
01:01:26,354 --> 01:01:28,562
Locating optimal entry point.

1011
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:32,057
Proceed to southwest window.

1012
01:01:32,082 --> 01:01:33,414
Karen, I'm on my way.

1013
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:40,672
- There's a lot of glass here.
- You got this.

1014
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:41,904
Keep coming, keep coming.

1015
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:57,954
Okay. Oh, my God.

1016
01:01:57,979 --> 01:01:59,312
Okay.

1017
01:02:01,468 --> 01:02:05,074
What's wrong? You've reached the
southwest window. Why are you hesitating?

1018
01:02:05,098 --> 01:02:07,304
It's fine. It's just
I've just never been this high before.

1019
01:02:07,329 --> 01:02:09,784
You have also not reinstalled
your parachute,

1020
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:12,517
so a fall from this height
would most likely be lethal.

1021
01:02:14,037 --> 01:02:15,218
Perfect.

1022
01:02:15,774 --> 01:02:17,257
Oh, my God.

1023
01:02:18,753 --> 01:02:20,170
Why is it not breaking?

1024
01:02:20,195 --> 01:02:23,303
It's four-inch ballistic glass.
You'll have to create more momentum.

1025
01:02:42,983 --> 01:02:45,316
This is D.C. Metro Police.
Identify yourself.

1026
01:02:45,415 --> 01:02:47,322
My friends are in there! Stop!

1027
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:49,088
Return to the ground immediately.

1028
01:02:49,113 --> 01:02:51,207
- Okay, who's next?
- Me, it's my turn.

1029
01:02:51,232 --> 01:02:53,064
Flash, seriously? What are you doing?

1030
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:55,793
- Come on.
- Don't worry about the trophy.

1031
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:05,024
Stand down!

1032
01:03:05,049 --> 01:03:07,660
Return to the ground immediately.

1033
01:03:11,597 --> 01:03:14,266
Return to the ground or we will open fire!

1034
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:15,723
Go up, go up.

1035
01:03:16,897 --> 01:03:18,263
I got this.

1036
01:03:18,288 --> 01:03:19,731
Take my trophy.

1037
01:03:22,007 --> 01:03:24,215
This is your last chance.

1038
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:25,988
I'm gonna die.

1039
01:03:35,053 --> 01:03:36,009
Break!

1040
01:03:50,139 --> 01:03:51,278
I did it.

1041
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:07,549
Hey, how you doing? Don't worry. I got you.

1042
01:04:08,011 --> 01:04:09,725
Yes! Yes.

1043
01:04:09,758 --> 01:04:11,555
Hey, hey, hey. Big guy, quit moving around.

1044
01:04:11,579 --> 01:04:12,805
I'm sorry, sir. So sorry.

1045
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:17,472
Let's go, let's go!

1046
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:24,396
Okay, okay.

1047
01:04:24,553 --> 01:04:26,510
- Mr. Harrington, go.
- Ned, come on.

1048
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:28,619
- All right, this is your stop.
- Come on, Liz.

1049
01:04:28,644 --> 01:04:31,718
Go, go, go. Everybody out.
Move it, people. Move it, move it.

1050
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:33,234
- Are you sure it's safe?
- Liz.

1051
01:04:34,162 --> 01:04:35,129
Liz!

1052
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:41,246
You're okay. You're okay.

1053
01:04:44,756 --> 01:04:45,832
Okay.

1054
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:48,074
- Oh, my God.
- Good, good.

1055
01:04:48,099 --> 01:04:49,965
Come on up. Come on, you guys, stay back.

1056
01:04:50,099 --> 01:04:52,091
- Come on in.
- You guys good?

1057
01:04:52,347 --> 01:04:53,713
So is everyone okay?

1058
01:04:55,183 --> 01:04:57,175
This is your chance, Peter.

1059
01:04:57,352 --> 01:04:58,817
Kiss her.

1060
01:05:02,854 --> 01:05:04,176
Thank you.

1061
01:05:07,612 --> 01:05:10,150
Are you really friends with Peter Parker?

1062
01:05:17,122 --> 01:05:21,752
I can finish the next order, but without
any new materials from that truck...

1063
01:05:22,522 --> 01:05:24,275
Yeah, damn it.

1064
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:27,463
We still have enough to do
the Gargan deal though, right?

1065
01:05:27,488 --> 01:05:29,228
Yeah, but then that's it.

1066
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:35,978
Maybe it is time
that I built the high-altitude seal.

1067
01:05:36,015 --> 01:05:37,627
- Would you shut up about that?
- It's only one job.

1068
01:05:37,652 --> 01:05:38,791
No.

1069
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:43,353
Eight years, not a word from the feds,

1070
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:47,822
nothing from those Halloween-costume-
wearing bozos up there in Stark Tower.

1071
01:05:48,403 --> 01:05:53,114
And then all of a sudden,
this little bastard in red tights shows up.

1072
01:05:53,228 --> 01:05:56,564
And he thinks he can tear down
everything I've built.

1073
01:05:58,369 --> 01:05:59,905
Really?

1074
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:02,327
I'm gonna kill him.

1075
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,537
- I'm gonna find him...
- Found him.

1076
01:06:04,711 --> 01:06:05,966
The Spider-Man swooped in,

1077
01:06:06,001 --> 01:06:09,413
heroically saving an Academic
Decathlon team from Queens.

1078
01:06:09,741 --> 01:06:12,772
The identity of the masked hero
is still unknown.

1079
01:06:14,819 --> 01:06:17,062
- Mom.
- Oh, kids. All right.

1080
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:19,952
Peter. Come here, come here, come here.

1081
01:06:23,945 --> 01:06:26,507
This past weekend,
Midtown's Academic Decathlon team

1082
01:06:26,532 --> 01:06:29,836
defeated the country's best
to win the national championship.

1083
01:06:29,861 --> 01:06:31,523
Later that day, they also defeated death.

1084
01:06:31,548 --> 01:06:34,077
Explosion. Sally scream.
Flash scream. Everybody screaming.

1085
01:06:34,102 --> 01:06:37,999
There were purple lasers and smoke.
It was **** tight, like a Bon Jovi concert.

1086
01:06:38,024 --> 01:06:41,288
As you know, we made it out alive,
and that's the important thing.

1087
01:06:41,672 --> 01:06:44,390
I couldn't bear to lose a student
on a school trip.

1088
01:06:46,127 --> 01:06:47,312
Not again.

1089
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:51,179
Thankfully, no one was seriously injured
thanks to the Spider-Man.

1090
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:53,461
- Thank you, Spider-Man.
- Thank you, Spider-Man.

1091
01:06:53,548 --> 01:06:56,696
Up next: the Spider-Man mania
is sweeping the school.

1092
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:59,218
How can you show your spider spirit?

1093
01:07:03,269 --> 01:07:05,181
Dude, dude, dude.

1094
01:07:05,355 --> 01:07:08,063
What is it like being famous
when nobody knows it's you?

1095
01:07:08,233 --> 01:07:09,690
- Crazy, dude.
- It's crazy.

1096
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:10,906
Should we tell everyone?

1097
01:07:10,949 --> 01:07:11,819
No.

1098
01:07:11,844 --> 01:07:13,073
Should I tell everyone?

1099
01:07:13,104 --> 01:07:14,976
No, dude. That's not a good idea.

1100
01:07:15,001 --> 01:07:16,652
Okay, come on, we'll be late to class.

1101
01:07:16,676 --> 01:07:17,944
I'm not going to class.

1102
01:07:18,232 --> 01:07:20,077
You're already in trouble
for ditching the decathlon.

1103
01:07:20,102 --> 01:07:21,843
Dude, listen, I figured it out.

1104
01:07:21,868 --> 01:07:23,944
The wingsuit guy is stealing
from Damage Control.

1105
01:07:23,969 --> 01:07:26,163
What he takes from Damage Control,

1106
01:07:26,188 --> 01:07:28,613
that's how he builds the weapons.
So all I gotta do is catch him.

1107
01:07:28,637 --> 01:07:30,132
But we have a Spanish quiz.

1108
01:07:30,157 --> 01:07:32,649
Ned, I'm probably
never gonna come back here.

1109
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:37,292
Mr. Stark is moving the Avengers upstate,
so... when I bring this guy in...

1110
01:07:37,316 --> 01:07:38,136
Dude.

1111
01:07:38,161 --> 01:07:40,073
You want to be a high school dropout?

1112
01:07:40,098 --> 01:07:42,761
I am so far beyond high school right now.

1113
01:07:42,786 --> 01:07:45,327
Parker, my office.

1114
01:07:48,235 --> 01:07:49,366
So...

1115
01:07:50,108 --> 01:07:51,599
...you got detention.

1116
01:07:51,721 --> 01:07:54,087
You screwed up.
You know what you did was wrong.

1117
01:07:54,112 --> 01:07:56,479
The question is,
how are you gonna make things right?

1118
01:07:56,504 --> 01:07:57,991
Maybe you were trying to be cool.

1119
01:07:58,533 --> 01:08:01,344
But take it from a guy
who's been frozen for 65 years,

1120
01:08:01,369 --> 01:08:04,487
the only way to really be cool
is to follow the rules.

1121
01:08:05,404 --> 01:08:08,021
We all know what's right.
We all know what's wrong.

1122
01:08:08,297 --> 01:08:10,835
Next time those turkeys try to
convince you of something...

1123
01:08:10,841 --> 01:08:13,398
- Hey, where you going? Get back here.
- ...you know is wrong...

1124
01:08:13,423 --> 01:08:15,790
...just think to yourself,
what would Captain America do?

1125
01:08:15,967 --> 01:08:17,902
Why are you here?
You don't even have detention.

1126
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:21,511
Oh, I know. I just like coming here
to sketch people in crisis.

1127
01:08:24,726 --> 01:08:26,101
It's you.

1128
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:30,513
So your body's changing.
Believe me, I know how that feels.

1129
01:08:42,055 --> 01:08:43,233
May?

1130
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:48,444
Hey, Karen. What's up?

1131
01:08:48,469 --> 01:08:50,327
Hey, Peter. How was your Spanish quiz?

1132
01:08:50,335 --> 01:08:51,686
Listen, I was wondering
if you could help me.

1133
01:08:51,711 --> 01:08:54,203
I'm trying to figure out who the guys
under the bridge were that night,

1134
01:08:54,228 --> 01:08:56,944
but I can only remember
part of a license plate.

1135
01:08:56,969 --> 01:08:59,757
I can run facial recognition on
the footage of that encounter.

1136
01:08:59,782 --> 01:09:01,390
- Footage?
- Yes, Peter.

1137
01:09:01,524 --> 01:09:03,390
I record everything you see.

1138
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:04,797
- Everything?
- Everything.

1139
01:09:04,822 --> 01:09:07,241
- All the time?
- It's called the Baby-Monitor Protocol.

1140
01:09:07,914 --> 01:09:09,593
Yeah, of course it is.

1141
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:14,208
- Yeah, just roll it back to last Friday.
- With pleasure.

1142
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:16,099
Hey, everyone. Yeah, kick-ass party.

1143
01:09:16,124 --> 01:09:18,749
Hey, what's up, Liz?
Peter's told me a lot about you.

1144
01:09:18,774 --> 01:09:22,723
No, no, no. This is just me messing around.
Go later in the day, later in the day.

1145
01:09:23,034 --> 01:09:25,202
It is I, Thor, son of Odin.

1146
01:09:25,227 --> 01:09:26,971
No, no, no. That's definitely...

1147
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,578
That's definitely not
what we wanted to watch.

1148
01:09:28,748 --> 01:09:31,757
- Your impressions are very funny.
- Fast-forward to the arms deal.

1149
01:09:32,246 --> 01:09:33,532
Okay.

1150
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:37,421
- The two on the right, who are they?
- Searching law enforcement databases.

1151
01:09:38,257 --> 01:09:40,249
No records found
for two of the individuals.

1152
01:09:40,274 --> 01:09:42,640
- Nothing?
- One individual identified.

1153
01:09:42,665 --> 01:09:44,782
Aaron Davis, age 33.

1154
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:47,806
He has a criminal record
and an address here in Queens.

1155
01:09:47,831 --> 01:09:49,366
Let's pay him a visit.

1156
01:09:49,394 --> 01:09:52,728
Would you like me to activate
the Enhanced Interrogation Protocol?

1157
01:09:53,021 --> 01:09:54,102
Yeah.

1158
01:10:08,978 --> 01:10:10,874
- Remember me?
- Hey...

1159
01:10:11,124 --> 01:10:13,101
I need information.
You'll give it to me now.

1160
01:10:13,126 --> 01:10:14,833
- All right, chill.
- Come on!

1161
01:10:15,591 --> 01:10:16,675
What happened to your voice?

1162
01:10:16,699 --> 01:10:18,361
What do you mean what happened to my voice?

1163
01:10:18,381 --> 01:10:20,464
I heard you by the bridge.
I know what a girl sound like.

1164
01:10:20,489 --> 01:10:23,448
I'm not a girl. I'm a boy.
I mean, I'm a... I'm a man.

1165
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:25,593
I don't care what you are, a boy, a girl...

1166
01:10:25,618 --> 01:10:27,562
I'm not a girl. I'm a man.

1167
01:10:27,587 --> 01:10:29,920
Come on, man.
Look, who is selling these weapons?

1168
01:10:30,183 --> 01:10:32,390
I need to know. Give me names or else.

1169
01:10:35,885 --> 01:10:37,562
You ain't ever done this before, huh?

1170
01:10:37,722 --> 01:10:40,022
Deactivate Interrogation Mode.

1171
01:10:41,738 --> 01:10:42,788
Look, man.

1172
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:46,155
These guys are selling weapons
that are crazy dangerous.

1173
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:47,736
They can't be out on the streets.

1174
01:10:47,761 --> 01:10:49,991
If one of them can cut
Delmar's Bodega in half-

1175
01:10:50,016 --> 01:10:51,308
You know Delmar's?

1176
01:10:51,332 --> 01:10:52,858
Yeah, best sandwich in Queens.

1177
01:10:52,883 --> 01:10:54,167
Sub Haven's pretty good.

1178
01:10:54,191 --> 01:10:55,351
It's too much bread.

1179
01:10:55,376 --> 01:10:56,206
I like bread.

1180
01:10:56,230 --> 01:10:57,616
Come on, man, please.

1181
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:02,547
Stupid Interrogation Mode.
Karen, don't ever do that again.

1182
01:11:02,572 --> 01:11:06,031
The other night, you told that dude,
"If you're gonna shoot somebody, shoot me."

1183
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:07,802
That's pretty ballsy.

1184
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:11,218
I don't want those weapons in this
neighborhood. I got a nephew who live here.

1185
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:14,162
Who are these guys?

1186
01:11:14,187 --> 01:11:16,099
What can you tell me about
the guy with the wings?

1187
01:11:16,124 --> 01:11:18,666
Other than he's a psychopath
dressed like a demon, nothing.

1188
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:20,648
I don't know who he is or where he is.

1189
01:11:23,466 --> 01:11:25,132
I do know where he's gonna be.

1190
01:11:26,137 --> 01:11:27,258
Really?

1191
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:32,147
Yeah, this crazy dude I used to work with,
he's supposed to be doing a deal with him.

1192
01:11:32,172 --> 01:11:33,788
Yes! Yes.

1193
01:11:33,987 --> 01:11:35,569
Hey. Hey. Hey.

1194
01:11:35,594 --> 01:11:37,881
I didn't tell you where.
You don't have a location.

1195
01:11:38,005 --> 01:11:40,741
Right, of course.
Yeah, my bad. Silly. Just...

1196
01:11:40,968 --> 01:11:43,194
Yeah. Where is it?

1197
01:11:43,219 --> 01:11:44,687
Can I give you some advice?

1198
01:11:45,181 --> 01:11:47,757
You got to get better
at this part of the job.

1199
01:11:47,782 --> 01:11:49,239
I don't understand.

1200
01:11:49,469 --> 01:11:50,835
I'm intimidating.

1201
01:11:50,860 --> 01:11:53,728
- Staten Island Ferry, 11.
- Oh, that's soon.

1202
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:55,995
That's gonna dissolve in two hours.

1203
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:58,603
No, no, no. Come fix this.

1204
01:11:58,628 --> 01:12:00,343
- Two hours. You deserve that.
- I got ice cream in here.

1205
01:12:00,368 --> 01:12:02,951
You deserve that. You're a criminal.
Bye, Mr. Criminal.

1206
01:12:17,724 --> 01:12:18,921
Nice.

1207
01:12:22,288 --> 01:12:25,191
Okay, Karen,
activate Enhanced Reconnaissance Mode.

1208
01:12:25,216 --> 01:12:26,252
Sure thing.

1209
01:12:26,626 --> 01:12:28,743
He's up front, main deck.

1210
01:12:28,857 --> 01:12:30,268
I hate this guy.

1211
01:12:30,395 --> 01:12:32,990
It's the guy from the bridge, right?
Who's that other guy?

1212
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:34,429
Just keep me posted.

1213
01:12:34,454 --> 01:12:36,530
There's no record of him
in my criminal database.

1214
01:12:36,774 --> 01:12:39,437
Incoming call from May Parker.
Should I reroute to your heads-up display?

1215
01:12:39,462 --> 01:12:41,358
I can't talk right now. I'll call her back.

1216
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:47,108
Hey, dronie, keep an eye on that guy.
We can't let anybody get away this time.

1217
01:12:55,550 --> 01:12:57,849
- Who's the guy on the left?
- Mac Gargan.

1218
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:00,287
Extensive criminal record,
including homicide.

1219
01:13:00,428 --> 01:13:02,327
Would you like me to activate Instant Kill?

1220
01:13:02,352 --> 01:13:05,233
No, Karen, stop it
with the Instant Kill already.

1221
01:13:06,888 --> 01:13:08,647
White pickup truck.

1222
01:13:13,441 --> 01:13:15,728
Dronie, scan the ship
for a white pickup truck.

1223
01:13:36,866 --> 01:13:38,306
Oh, this is too perfect.

1224
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:40,664
I got the weapons, buyers and sellers
in one place.

1225
01:13:40,689 --> 01:13:42,581
Incoming call from Tony Stark.

1226
01:13:42,605 --> 01:13:43,765
No, no, no.

1227
01:13:43,790 --> 01:13:45,858
- Don't answer.
- Mr. Parker. Got a sec?

1228
01:13:46,297 --> 01:13:48,710
- I'm actually at school.
- No, you're not.

1229
01:13:48,735 --> 01:13:50,741
- Nice work in D.C.
- Okay.

1230
01:13:50,931 --> 01:13:53,647
My dad never really gave me
a lot of support

1231
01:13:53,672 --> 01:13:55,780
and I'm just trying to break
the cycle of shame.

1232
01:13:55,806 --> 01:13:57,229
I'm kinda in the middle of something
right now.

1233
01:13:57,251 --> 01:13:58,993
Don't cut me off
when I'm complimenting you.

1234
01:13:59,018 --> 01:14:01,089
Anyway, great things are about to...

1235
01:14:01,113 --> 01:14:02,202
What is that?

1236
01:14:02,972 --> 01:14:04,634
I'm at band practice.

1237
01:14:04,901 --> 01:14:09,566
That's odd. Happy told me
you quit band six weeks ago. What's up?

1238
01:14:09,591 --> 01:14:11,799
- I gotta go. End call.
- Hey.

1239
01:14:11,968 --> 01:14:13,084
I'll take those!

1240
01:14:16,824 --> 01:14:20,077
Hey, guys. The illegal weapons-deal ferry
was at 10:30. You missed it.

1241
01:14:29,146 --> 01:14:30,663
Spider guy's here.

1242
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:35,530
Not so fast.

1243
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:39,788
Are you guys okay?
My bad. That was a little hard.

1244
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:43,288
I got to say, the other guy was way better
with that thing.

1245
01:14:44,272 --> 01:14:45,562
I'm honestly...

1246
01:14:45,587 --> 01:14:47,202
I'm... I'm shocked.

1247
01:14:59,745 --> 01:15:01,702
- Freeze! FBI.
- Don't move.

1248
01:15:01,872 --> 01:15:03,659
- Get on the ground.
- FBI.

1249
01:15:03,684 --> 01:15:04,869
What do you mean, FBI?

1250
01:15:04,894 --> 01:15:06,433
The FBI is
the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

1251
01:15:06,457 --> 01:15:08,546
I know what the FBI means,
but what are they doing here?

1252
01:15:16,303 --> 01:15:17,855
Get out of the way. Get out of the way!

1253
01:15:19,792 --> 01:15:20,758
No.

1254
01:15:22,632 --> 01:15:24,707
Look out, look out, look out.
Move, move, move!

1255
01:15:30,925 --> 01:15:32,385
- Move.
- Get to the top deck.

1256
01:15:32,410 --> 01:15:33,946
We're getting out of here.

1257
01:16:13,319 --> 01:16:15,035
Activate Taser web!

1258
01:16:26,519 --> 01:16:28,949
You're messing with things
you don't understand.

1259
01:17:09,087 --> 01:17:10,423
Oh, my God. What do I do?

1260
01:17:10,448 --> 01:17:13,587
Karen... give me an x-ray of the boat
and target all the strongest points.

1261
01:17:16,931 --> 01:17:18,767
Web grenade. Web grenade.

1262
01:17:21,178 --> 01:17:22,720
Splitter web, go.

1263
01:17:51,074 --> 01:17:54,491
Great job, Peter.
You are 98 percent successful.

1264
01:17:54,526 --> 01:17:55,573
Ninety-eight?

1265
01:17:55,597 --> 01:17:57,249
Yeah, Spider-Man!

1266
01:17:59,733 --> 01:18:01,538
No, no, no.

1267
01:18:36,174 --> 01:18:37,499
What the hell?

1268
01:18:41,315 --> 01:18:42,952
What the hell?

1269
01:18:44,961 --> 01:18:46,889
Hi, Spider-Man.

1270
01:18:46,914 --> 01:18:48,522
Band practice, was it?

1271
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:12,225
Yeah, Iron Man!

1272
01:19:20,798 --> 01:19:22,124
Mr. Stark.

1273
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:26,850
Hey, Mr. Stark, could I do anything?
What do you want me to do?

1274
01:19:28,062 --> 01:19:30,202
I think you've done enough.

1275
01:19:44,571 --> 01:19:47,366
So that's it. You're just gonna run?

1276
01:19:50,069 --> 01:19:52,202
Feds were waiting for us.

1277
01:19:52,540 --> 01:19:54,913
Now we're on Iron Man's radar?

1278
01:19:55,984 --> 01:19:57,530
Yeah, I'm running.

1279
01:19:58,711 --> 01:19:59,905
You should too.

1280
01:20:00,421 --> 01:20:02,253
You know I can't do that.

1281
01:20:02,278 --> 01:20:03,485
So now what?

1282
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:08,760
Mason, can you get that high-altitude
seal thing up and running in time?

1283
01:20:09,469 --> 01:20:10,835
Seriously?

1284
01:20:11,098 --> 01:20:13,260
Yes. You will not regret this.

1285
01:20:16,526 --> 01:20:17,678
You in?

1286
01:20:28,782 --> 01:20:32,970
Previously on Peter Screws the Pooch,
I tell you to stay away from this.

1287
01:20:32,995 --> 01:20:35,612
Instead, you hacked
a multimillion-dollar suit,

1288
01:20:35,637 --> 01:20:40,980
so you could sneak around behind my back,
doing the one thing I told you not to do.

1289
01:20:41,211 --> 01:20:42,201
Is everyone okay?

1290
01:20:42,908 --> 01:20:45,059
No thanks to you.

1291
01:20:46,234 --> 01:20:47,824
No thanks to me?

1292
01:20:49,966 --> 01:20:52,418
Those weapons were out there,
and I tried to tell you about it,

1293
01:20:52,443 --> 01:20:54,121
but you didn't listen.

1294
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:57,035
None of this would've happened
if you had just listened to me.

1295
01:20:57,720 --> 01:20:59,863
If you even cared, you'd actually be here.

1296
01:21:04,318 --> 01:21:07,402
I did listen, kid.
Who do you think called the FBI, huh?

1297
01:21:07,733 --> 01:21:10,340
Do you know I was the only one
who believed in you?

1298
01:21:10,365 --> 01:21:14,262
Everyone else said I was crazy to
recruit a 14-year-old kid.

1299
01:21:14,287 --> 01:21:15,110
I'm 15.

1300
01:21:15,134 --> 01:21:17,883
No, this is where you zip it, all right? 
The adult is talking.

1301
01:21:17,915 --> 01:21:19,588
What if somebody had died tonight?

1302
01:21:19,613 --> 01:21:22,098
Different story, right?
Because that's on you.

1303
01:21:22,580 --> 01:21:25,980
And if you died... 
I feel like that's on me.

1304
01:21:26,924 --> 01:21:28,790
- I don't need that on my conscience.
- Yes, sir.

1305
01:21:28,815 --> 01:21:29,899
I'm sorry.

1306
01:21:29,923 --> 01:21:31,574
- Sorry doesn't cut it.
- I understand.

1307
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:34,133
I just... I just wanted to be like you.

1308
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:35,842
And I wanted you to be better.

1309
01:21:37,601 --> 01:21:39,968
Okay, it's not working out.
I'm gonna need the suit back.

1310
01:21:39,993 --> 01:21:41,191
For how long?

1311
01:21:41,415 --> 01:21:42,498
Forever.

1312
01:21:42,523 --> 01:21:44,560
- Yeah, that's how it works.
- No, no. Please.

1313
01:21:44,585 --> 01:21:45,730
- Let's have it.
- You don't undertand.

1314
01:21:45,755 --> 01:21:48,168
Please, this is all I have.
I'm nothing without this suit.

1315
01:21:48,946 --> 01:21:52,262
If you're nothing without this suit,
then you shouldn't have it. Okay?

1316
01:21:52,842 --> 01:21:54,340
God, I sound like my dad.

1317
01:21:56,925 --> 01:21:58,791
I don't have any other clothes.

1318
01:21:59,532 --> 01:22:01,105
Okay, we'll sort that out.

1319
01:22:11,844 --> 01:22:12,769
Hey.

1320
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:21,294
I've been calling you all day.
You didn't answer your phone.

1321
01:22:21,410 --> 01:22:22,867
You can't do that.

1322
01:22:23,060 --> 01:22:25,348
Then this ferry thing happens.

1323
01:22:25,862 --> 01:22:29,947
I've called five police stations. Five.

1324
01:22:30,059 --> 01:22:31,668
I called five of your friends.
I called Ned's mother.

1325
01:22:31,693 --> 01:22:35,312
I'm fine. May, I'm okay.
Honestly, just relax. I'm fine.

1326
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:37,824
Cut the bullshit.

1327
01:22:37,849 --> 01:22:39,511
I know you left detention.

1328
01:22:39,705 --> 01:22:42,197
I know you left the hotel room
in Washington.

1329
01:22:42,222 --> 01:22:44,435
I know you sneak out of this house
every night.

1330
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:45,746
That's not fine.

1331
01:22:45,771 --> 01:22:49,390
Peter, you have to tell me what's going on.
Just lay it out.

1332
01:22:49,415 --> 01:22:50,738
It's just me and you.

1333
01:22:52,516 --> 01:22:54,132
I lost the Stark internship.

1334
01:22:54,845 --> 01:22:56,427
- What?
- Yeah.

1335
01:22:56,889 --> 01:22:58,005
What happened?

1336
01:22:58,557 --> 01:23:02,293
I just thought that I could work really
hard and he could... He would... You know.

1337
01:23:02,318 --> 01:23:05,441
But... I screwed it up.

1338
01:23:05,918 --> 01:23:07,465
It's okay, it's okay.

1339
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:10,613
It's okay.

1340
01:23:11,939 --> 01:23:13,980
I'm sorry I made you worry.

1341
01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:16,530
I'm not trying to ruin your life.

1342
01:23:16,555 --> 01:23:17,841
Yeah, I know.

1343
01:23:17,979 --> 01:23:21,219
Just... I used to sneak out too.

1344
01:23:21,243 --> 01:23:22,176
Yeah.

1345
01:23:24,929 --> 01:23:27,355
And take a shower. You smell.

1346
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:30,203
You smell like garbage.

1347
01:23:30,228 --> 01:23:31,668
I know.

1348
01:23:35,099 --> 01:23:37,363
Peter, you're a good kid 
and you're a smart kid,

1349
01:23:37,388 --> 01:23:39,574
so just try to keep your head straight,
okay?

1350
01:23:40,807 --> 01:23:41,996
Okay.

1351
01:23:42,239 --> 01:23:43,996
All right, get out of here.

1352
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:53,420
Are you expelled?

1353
01:23:53,445 --> 01:23:56,438
Do you have to go to that high school
where the principal has a crossbow?

1354
01:23:56,463 --> 01:23:59,621
Pretty sure that's an urban myth,
and, no, I'm not expelled.

1355
01:24:00,298 --> 01:24:02,168
You're so lucky.

1356
01:24:50,801 --> 01:24:52,019
Hey.

1357
01:24:52,462 --> 01:24:55,580
- Hey.
- I thought you had calculus fifth period.

1358
01:24:55,605 --> 01:24:57,972
Yeah, I was just doing
some homecoming stuff.

1359
01:24:58,184 --> 01:24:59,891
Hey, look, I...

1360
01:25:00,887 --> 01:25:03,595
I just wanted to apologize about
the whole decathlon thing.

1361
01:25:03,620 --> 01:25:04,701
It's fine.

1362
01:25:05,017 --> 01:25:09,057
Last week, decathlon was the most
important thing, but then I almost died.

1363
01:25:09,229 --> 01:25:11,141
No, I'm...

1364
01:25:11,166 --> 01:25:12,910
I just mean that...

1365
01:25:13,817 --> 01:25:16,199
...it was not cool, especially...

1366
01:25:18,081 --> 01:25:19,652
...because...

1367
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:23,543
...I like you.

1368
01:25:23,991 --> 01:25:25,121
I know.

1369
01:25:28,332 --> 01:25:29,368
You do?

1370
01:25:29,932 --> 01:25:32,049
You're terrible at keeping secrets.

1371
01:25:32,336 --> 01:25:33,998
Yeah, you'd be surprised.

1372
01:25:37,382 --> 01:25:39,669
I got to get to class, but...

1373
01:25:39,967 --> 01:25:43,660
I'd say we should hang out,
but I'm gonna be in detention...

1374
01:25:44,431 --> 01:25:46,980
...forever, but...

1375
01:25:47,499 --> 01:25:49,902
I guess
you already have a date to homecoming.

1376
01:25:50,103 --> 01:25:54,074
Actually, I was so busy planning it, I
never really got around to that part, so...

1377
01:25:55,877 --> 01:25:58,939
Do you want to... go with me?

1378
01:25:59,819 --> 01:26:01,651
Yeah. Sure.

1379
01:26:01,676 --> 01:26:04,379
Really? I mean, great. Cool.

1380
01:26:04,816 --> 01:26:06,004
Cool.

1381
01:26:06,742 --> 01:26:09,348
I'm actually going that way.

1382
01:26:21,259 --> 01:26:22,466
May, I need your help.

1383
01:26:38,902 --> 01:26:40,603
Through or around?

1384
01:26:45,632 --> 01:26:46,873
Right?

1385
01:26:57,337 --> 01:26:59,579
It's game day. So, what's the plan?

1386
01:26:59,604 --> 01:27:01,140
Open the door for her.

1387
01:27:01,466 --> 01:27:04,027
Tell her she looks nice,
but not too much because that's creepy.

1388
01:27:04,052 --> 01:27:05,278
- Don't be creepy.
- No.

1389
01:27:05,303 --> 01:27:07,966
When I dance with her,
I'm putting my hands on her hips.

1390
01:27:07,991 --> 01:27:09,415
I got this.

1391
01:27:12,310 --> 01:27:13,337
- Love you.
- Bye.

1392
01:27:28,149 --> 01:27:29,765
You must be Peter.

1393
01:27:30,571 --> 01:27:31,687
Yeah.

1394
01:27:31,911 --> 01:27:33,447
I'm Liz's dad.

1395
01:27:33,582 --> 01:27:34,900
Put her there.

1396
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:37,328
Hell of a grip.

1397
01:27:37,353 --> 01:27:39,486
Come on in here. Come on.

1398
01:28:03,320 --> 01:28:04,561
Hi, Peter.

1399
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:06,820
You look very handsome.

1400
01:28:06,845 --> 01:28:07,975
Thank you.

1401
01:28:08,658 --> 01:28:10,436
You got his name right?

1402
01:28:10,952 --> 01:28:12,471
- Freddie?
- Peter.

1403
01:28:12,496 --> 01:28:13,703
Peter. Peter.

1404
01:28:14,706 --> 01:28:15,983
I'm gonna go get Liz.

1405
01:28:16,249 --> 01:28:17,499
Okay.

1406
01:28:23,757 --> 01:28:24,964
You all right, Pete?

1407
01:28:25,086 --> 01:28:26,202
Yeah.

1408
01:28:26,635 --> 01:28:29,002
Because you look pale.

1409
01:28:30,847 --> 01:28:34,716
You want something to drink? A bourbon
or a Scotch, or something like that?

1410
01:28:34,893 --> 01:28:36,179
I'm not old enough to drink.

1411
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:38,139
That's the right answer.

1412
01:28:42,609 --> 01:28:45,352
- Do you look beautiful.
- Please don't embarrass me, Dad.

1413
01:28:45,377 --> 01:28:46,788
Doesn't she, Pete?

1414
01:28:46,988 --> 01:28:49,355
Yeah, you look really good.

1415
01:28:49,658 --> 01:28:51,866
Once again, that's the right answer.

1416
01:28:51,891 --> 01:28:53,639
Is that a corsage?

1417
01:28:55,831 --> 01:28:57,311
Thanks.

1418
01:28:57,421 --> 01:29:00,852
Well, hey, I'm your chauffeur,
so let's get this show on the road.

1419
01:29:00,877 --> 01:29:03,202
No, no, no, we have to take
some pictures, babe.

1420
01:29:03,227 --> 01:29:04,038
 All right.

1421
01:29:04,063 --> 01:29:06,305
- Oh, right here. Perfect.
- Mom.

1422
01:29:06,633 --> 01:29:08,249
Okay. Come on, you guys.

1423
01:29:08,671 --> 01:29:10,452
Peter, closer.

1424
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:13,546
Smile.

1425
01:29:14,516 --> 01:29:16,007
There you go.

1426
01:29:22,107 --> 01:29:25,271
- Sir, you don't have to drive us.
- No, no, it's not a big deal.

1427
01:29:25,395 --> 01:29:27,603
I'm going out of town.
It's right on my way.

1428
01:29:27,727 --> 01:29:28,850
He's always coming and going.

1429
01:29:28,875 --> 01:29:31,155
- Last time. Promise.
- Thank you.

1430
01:29:31,371 --> 01:29:32,600
He's cute.

1431
01:29:34,671 --> 01:29:37,254
- See you in a couple of days. All right.
- Bye, baby.

1432
01:29:37,510 --> 01:29:39,092
Come on, Pedro.

1433
01:29:39,457 --> 01:29:41,369
- Bye, Peter. Have fun.
- Yeah, I will.

1434
01:29:51,658 --> 01:29:53,433
What are you gonna do, Pete?

1435
01:29:53,457 --> 01:29:54,514
What?

1436
01:29:54,806 --> 01:29:56,547
When you graduate,
what do you think you'll do?

1437
01:29:56,725 --> 01:29:59,308
- Oh, I don't know.
- Don't grill him, Dad.

1438
01:29:59,982 --> 01:30:01,974
Just saying, you know.

1439
01:30:02,575 --> 01:30:04,124
All you guys who go to that school,

1440
01:30:04,149 --> 01:30:06,562
you pretty much have your life 
planned out, right?

1441
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:09,272
Yeah, no, I'm just a sophomore.

1442
01:30:09,359 --> 01:30:12,773
Peter has an internship with Tony Stark.
I think he doesn't have to worry.

1443
01:30:13,575 --> 01:30:15,421
Really? Stark?

1444
01:30:15,446 --> 01:30:16,671
So cool.

1445
01:30:18,175 --> 01:30:19,336
What do you do?

1446
01:30:20,261 --> 01:30:22,934
Yeah, actually,
I don't intern for him anymore.

1447
01:30:22,959 --> 01:30:23,995
Seriously?

1448
01:30:24,019 --> 01:30:27,165
Yeah, it got... boring.

1449
01:30:27,190 --> 01:30:30,366
It was boring?
You got to hang out with Spider-Man.

1450
01:30:30,467 --> 01:30:32,379
Really? Spider-Man?

1451
01:30:34,012 --> 01:30:35,423
What's he like?

1452
01:30:36,365 --> 01:30:37,901
Yeah, he's nice.

1453
01:30:38,106 --> 01:30:39,577
Nice man.

1454
01:30:40,226 --> 01:30:41,710
Solid dude.

1455
01:30:44,895 --> 01:30:46,978
Look. So cute.

1456
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:54,710
I've seen you around, right? I mean...

1457
01:30:55,298 --> 01:30:58,600
...somewhere. We've... Have we ever...
Because even the voice...

1458
01:30:59,329 --> 01:31:01,036
He does Academic Decathlon with me.

1459
01:31:01,844 --> 01:31:03,426
And he was at my party.

1460
01:31:03,792 --> 01:31:08,620
It was a great party, really great, yeah. 
Beautiful house, a lot of windows.

1461
01:31:08,630 --> 01:31:10,608
You were there for, like, two seconds.

1462
01:31:11,216 --> 01:31:14,296
That was...
I was there longer than two seconds.

1463
01:31:14,612 --> 01:31:18,105
- You disappeared.
- No. No, I did not disappear.

1464
01:31:18,130 --> 01:31:22,007
Yes, you did. You disappeared like
you always do, like you did in D.C. too.

1465
01:31:30,068 --> 01:31:33,257
That's terrible what happened 
down there in D.C. though.

1466
01:31:33,407 --> 01:31:35,023
Were you scared?

1467
01:31:35,990 --> 01:31:37,183
I'll bet you were glad

1468
01:31:37,206 --> 01:31:40,561
when your old pal Spider-Man
showed up in the elevator though, huh?

1469
01:31:43,581 --> 01:31:47,199
Yeah, well, I-I actually didn't go up.
I-I saw it all from the ground.

1470
01:31:48,211 --> 01:31:49,343
Yeah.

1471
01:31:49,606 --> 01:31:51,850
Very lucky that he was there that day.

1472
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:57,600
Good old Spider-Man.

1473
01:32:01,437 --> 01:32:03,349
Dad, the light.

1474
01:32:18,825 --> 01:32:21,033
Here we are. End of the line.

1475
01:32:21,058 --> 01:32:22,155
Thanks, Dad.

1476
01:32:23,069 --> 01:32:24,615
You head in there, gumdrop.

1477
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:27,499
I'm gonna give Peter the "dad" talk.

1478
01:32:29,387 --> 01:32:31,218
Don't let him intimidate you.

1479
01:32:31,546 --> 01:32:32,753
Love you.

1480
01:32:32,778 --> 01:32:34,694
- Love you, gumdrop.
- Have a safe flight.

1481
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:36,757
Hi.

1482
01:32:37,802 --> 01:32:40,089
You guys look so pretty.

1483
01:32:44,934 --> 01:32:45,970
Does she know?

1484
01:32:46,871 --> 01:32:48,157
Know what?

1485
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:50,373
So she doesn't. Good.

1486
01:32:50,398 --> 01:32:53,246
Close to the vest. I admire that.

1487
01:32:53,544 --> 01:32:55,491
I've got a few secrets of my own.

1488
01:32:56,282 --> 01:32:59,616
Of all the reasons
I didn't want my daughter to date...

1489
01:33:02,186 --> 01:33:03,389
Peter,

1490
01:33:03,912 --> 01:33:06,120
nothing is more important than family.

1491
01:33:06,145 --> 01:33:10,081
You saved my daughter's life.
I could never forget something like that.

1492
01:33:10,106 --> 01:33:11,847
So I'm gonna give you one chance.

1493
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:13,286
Are you ready?

1494
01:33:14,005 --> 01:33:17,108
You walk through those doors,
you forget any of this happened...

1495
01:33:17,425 --> 01:33:23,413
...and don't you ever, ever...
interfere with my business again.

1496
01:33:23,660 --> 01:33:25,491
Because if you do,

1497
01:33:25,723 --> 01:33:29,810
I'll kill you... and everybody you love.

1498
01:33:31,064 --> 01:33:32,896
I'll kill you dead.

1499
01:33:32,921 --> 01:33:35,928
That's what I'll do to protect my family.
Do you understand?

1500
01:33:37,630 --> 01:33:38,882
Hey.

1501
01:33:40,532 --> 01:33:43,946
I just saved your life.
Now what do you say?

1502
01:33:46,029 --> 01:33:47,249
Thank you.

1503
01:33:47,570 --> 01:33:49,038
You're welcome.

1504
01:33:49,582 --> 01:33:55,123
Now you go on in there and
you show my daughter a good time, okay?

1505
01:33:55,716 --> 01:33:57,389
Just not too good.

1506
01:34:51,436 --> 01:34:52,472
Hey.

1507
01:34:54,939 --> 01:34:56,350
What did he say to you?

1508
01:35:00,612 --> 01:35:01,928
Gotta go.

1509
01:35:03,948 --> 01:35:05,389
I'm sorry.

1510
01:35:05,848 --> 01:35:07,522
You don't deserve this.

1511
01:35:29,307 --> 01:35:30,639
He gave you a choice.

1512
01:35:30,808 --> 01:35:32,891
- You chose wrong.
- What the hell?

1513
01:35:32,916 --> 01:35:34,578
What's with the crappy costume?

1514
01:35:37,038 --> 01:35:38,245
My web-shooters.

1515
01:35:47,283 --> 01:35:49,681
I wasn't sure about this thing at first, 
but...

1516
01:35:50,635 --> 01:35:51,557
...damn.

1517
01:35:57,043 --> 01:35:58,252
Gross.

1518
01:36:09,934 --> 01:36:12,861
- Why did he send you here?
- Guess you'll never know.

1519
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:19,180
Nice shot!

1520
01:36:24,302 --> 01:36:25,418
Yes!

1521
01:36:25,626 --> 01:36:27,650
Ned, the guy with the wings is Liz's dad.

1522
01:36:27,675 --> 01:36:29,842
- What?
- I gotta tell Mr. Stark.

1523
01:36:29,867 --> 01:36:32,345
Call Happy Hogan.
He's Mr. Stark's head of security.

1524
01:36:32,370 --> 01:36:34,472
And get a computer 
and track my phone for me.

1525
01:36:34,497 --> 01:36:35,396
Are you gonna be okay?

1526
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:37,892
Hurry, we gotta catch him
before he leaves town.

1527
01:36:38,626 --> 01:36:42,511
I'm sorry about dinner,
but I know when branzino's fresh,

1528
01:36:42,524 --> 01:36:44,572
and that was not fresh, okay? So-

1529
01:36:46,126 --> 01:36:47,845
Flash, I need your car and phone.

1530
01:36:47,870 --> 01:36:50,736
Sir, technically,
this is my dad's car, sir. So I can't...

1531
01:36:59,355 --> 01:37:01,267
Hello, Ned? Hey, hey, can you hear me?

1532
01:37:01,292 --> 01:37:02,431
Go for Ned.

1533
01:37:02,717 --> 01:37:04,904
Ned, I need you to track my phone for me.

1534
01:37:04,928 --> 01:37:06,205
Yeah, but where is it?

1535
01:37:10,908 --> 01:37:13,275
Genius move. Okay, he just passed
the GameStop on Jackson Avenue.

1536
01:37:13,300 --> 01:37:16,806
Hey, where are the headlights
on this thing? I'm in Flash's car.

1537
01:37:16,831 --> 01:37:19,164
- I'll pull the specs.
- Okay, you're on speakerphone.

1538
01:37:19,189 --> 01:37:21,256
You stole Flash's car. Awesome.

1539
01:37:21,280 --> 01:37:22,674
Yeah, it's awesome. It's...

1540
01:37:23,796 --> 01:37:25,982
Get out of the way, get out of the way! 
Move! Move!

1541
01:37:26,007 --> 01:37:27,775
- Peter, are you okay?
- I've never driven before,

1542
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:31,119
only with May in parking lots.
This is a huge step up.

1543
01:37:33,473 --> 01:37:35,033
Hey, have you gotten through to Happy yet?

1544
01:37:35,058 --> 01:37:37,549
Yeah. I'm working on it.
I just gotta backdoor the phone system.

1545
01:37:41,688 --> 01:37:43,395
Guy in the chair.

1546
01:37:48,613 --> 01:37:50,024
Takeoff in nine minutes.

1547
01:37:50,049 --> 01:37:51,916
Hello? Hello? Who is this?

1548
01:37:52,095 --> 01:37:53,569
- Mr. Happy, it's Ned.
- Who?

1549
01:37:53,594 --> 01:37:55,881
I'm an associate of Peter Parker.
Got something very important to tell you-

1550
01:37:55,906 --> 01:37:57,442
You gotta be shitting me.

1551
01:37:58,456 --> 01:37:59,492
Damn.

1552
01:37:59,517 --> 01:38:01,580
Hey, Ned, how we coming on
with those headlights?

1553
01:38:03,557 --> 01:38:06,497
Round knob to the left of
the steering wheel, turn clockwise.

1554
01:38:06,522 --> 01:38:07,808
Left, okay.

1555
01:38:08,044 --> 01:38:09,831
Okay, perfect. So where's my phone now?

1556
01:38:11,265 --> 01:38:13,196
He stopped in an old industrial park
in Brooklyn.

1557
01:38:13,221 --> 01:38:16,157
What? That makes no sense.
I thought he said he was going out of town.

1558
01:38:16,182 --> 01:38:19,596
Weird. Oh, I reached Mr. Happy.
Don't think he likes you, by the way.

1559
01:38:19,621 --> 01:38:21,283
It sounded like he was catching a flight.

1560
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:22,955
He said something about taking off
in nine minutes.

1561
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:24,972
- What?
- He was surrounded by a bunch of boxes.

1562
01:38:24,997 --> 01:38:26,751
Boxes? It's moving day.

1563
01:38:26,776 --> 01:38:30,002
It's moving day. He's gonna rob that plane.
I gotta stop him!

1564
01:38:33,895 --> 01:38:35,791
All right, wheels up in eight minutes.

1565
01:38:35,816 --> 01:38:38,638
We just got to load
Tony's old Hulkbuster Armor,

1566
01:38:38,663 --> 01:38:42,077
prototype for Cap's new shield,
and the Meging...

1567
01:38:42,210 --> 01:38:43,746
The Meg... The...

1568
01:38:43,900 --> 01:38:45,121
Thor's magic belt.

1569
01:38:46,430 --> 01:38:49,093
Okay, slow down.
You're getting close. It's on your right.

1570
01:38:49,118 --> 01:38:50,539
- What?
- Turn right. Turn right.

1571
01:39:00,276 --> 01:39:02,563
- Peter. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1572
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:04,817
Just keep trying to get through to Happy.

1573
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:07,395
It's been an honor, Spider-Man.

1574
01:39:08,098 --> 01:39:10,114
What are you doing here? There's a dance.

1575
01:39:14,574 --> 01:39:16,998
I'm... looking...

1576
01:39:17,180 --> 01:39:19,168
...at porn.

1577
01:39:57,700 --> 01:39:58,736
Hey!

1578
01:40:00,286 --> 01:40:01,652
Surprised?

1579
01:40:01,677 --> 01:40:03,216
Oh, hey, Pete.

1580
01:40:04,415 --> 01:40:05,701
I didn't hear you come in.

1581
01:40:05,875 --> 01:40:07,958
It's over. I've got you.

1582
01:40:08,127 --> 01:40:10,119
You know, I gotta tell you, Pete,

1583
01:40:10,713 --> 01:40:13,442
I really, really admire your grit.

1584
01:40:15,218 --> 01:40:16,630
I see why Liz likes you.

1585
01:40:18,544 --> 01:40:19,622
I do.

1586
01:40:19,639 --> 01:40:22,397
When you first came to the house,
I wasn't sure. I thought, "Really?"

1587
01:40:22,422 --> 01:40:23,759
But I get it now.

1588
01:40:24,581 --> 01:40:26,322
How could you do this to her?

1589
01:40:26,467 --> 01:40:30,802
To her? I'm not doing anything
to her, Pete. I'm doing this for her.

1590
01:40:31,403 --> 01:40:32,439
Yeah.

1591
01:40:36,554 --> 01:40:40,130
Peter... you're young.

1592
01:40:40,155 --> 01:40:42,595
You don't understand how the world works.

1593
01:40:42,620 --> 01:40:45,504
Yeah. But I understand that
selling weapons to criminals is wrong.

1594
01:40:45,540 --> 01:40:48,283
How do you think your buddy Stark
paid for that tower?

1595
01:40:48,308 --> 01:40:49,942
Or any of his little toys?

1596
01:40:49,967 --> 01:40:51,708
Those people, Pete, those people up there,

1597
01:40:51,733 --> 01:40:54,440
the rich and the powerful,
they do whatever they want.

1598
01:40:54,465 --> 01:40:55,841
Guys like us...

1599
01:40:56,384 --> 01:40:57,786
...like you and me...

1600
01:40:58,419 --> 01:40:59,876
...they don't care about us.

1601
01:41:00,015 --> 01:41:03,282
We build their roads, and we fight 
all their wars and everything,

1602
01:41:03,306 --> 01:41:04,989
but they don't care about us.

1603
01:41:05,142 --> 01:41:08,560
We have to pick up after them.
We have to eat their table scraps.

1604
01:41:10,487 --> 01:41:11,935
That's how it is.

1605
01:41:12,894 --> 01:41:15,169
I know you know
what I'm talking about, Peter.

1606
01:41:15,194 --> 01:41:16,935
Why are you telling me this?

1607
01:41:17,089 --> 01:41:19,547
Because I want you to understand.

1608
01:41:19,580 --> 01:41:24,028
And... I needed a little time 
to get her airborne.

1609
01:41:37,096 --> 01:41:38,325
I'm sorry, Peter.

1610
01:41:41,624 --> 01:41:44,739
What are you talking about?
That thing hasn't even touched me yet.

1611
01:41:45,761 --> 01:41:47,810
True. Then again...

1612
01:41:48,243 --> 01:41:49,950
...wasn't really trying to.

1613
01:41:55,818 --> 01:41:57,395
Chief, they're powering up engines.

1614
01:41:57,420 --> 01:42:00,060
- Okay. Yeah, yeah.
- Come on, come on, come on.

1615
01:42:51,916 --> 01:42:53,411
Okay, ready?

1616
01:43:02,635 --> 01:43:04,091
Hello?

1617
01:43:06,972 --> 01:43:08,429
Hello!

1618
01:43:08,599 --> 01:43:10,181
Please, hey.

1619
01:43:10,569 --> 01:43:12,856
Hey, please. I'm down here.

1620
01:43:12,881 --> 01:43:14,838
I'm down here. I'm stuck.

1621
01:43:14,863 --> 01:43:17,442
I'm stuck. I can't move. I can't...

1622
01:43:34,750 --> 01:43:38,395
<i>If you're nothing without this suit,
then you shouldn't have it.</i>

1623
01:43:44,499 --> 01:43:46,028
Come on, Peter.

1624
01:43:46,690 --> 01:43:48,226
Come on, Spider-Man.

1625
01:43:48,251 --> 01:43:49,911
Come on, Spider-Man.

1626
01:43:50,558 --> 01:43:52,325
Come on, Spider-Man.

1627
01:43:54,512 --> 01:43:56,419
Come on, Spider-Man!

1628
01:44:47,948 --> 01:44:49,778
Launch for intercept.
Green light. Green light.

1629
01:44:49,803 --> 01:44:51,130
Oh, yeah.

1630
01:45:06,634 --> 01:45:08,763
Retroreflective panels engaged.

1631
01:45:20,862 --> 01:45:23,775
Got a visual on the plane,
but I'm feeling a little resistance.

1632
01:45:23,853 --> 01:45:26,127
It's probably just drag
on the new turbines.

1633
01:45:39,221 --> 01:45:41,617
Look out for the cloaking cameras.
Stay in the blind spots.

1634
01:45:51,908 --> 01:45:53,649
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1635
01:45:54,181 --> 01:45:56,594
Deploying high-altitude vacuum seal.

1636
01:45:56,619 --> 01:45:58,094
This better work, Mason.

1637
01:46:03,858 --> 01:46:07,044
Trust me, boss, even one of those boxes
and we are set for life.

1638
01:46:07,069 --> 01:46:08,094
Yeah.

1639
01:46:20,508 --> 01:46:23,516
You have 30 seconds to get to the cockpit
and override their security.

1640
01:46:35,740 --> 01:46:37,391
Cloning transponder signal.

1641
01:46:37,416 --> 01:46:39,078
Launching decoy drone.

1642
01:46:43,139 --> 01:46:44,914
Entering new coordinates.

1643
01:46:51,405 --> 01:46:53,559
- Good, so it's on its way.
- Yes, sir, right on course.

1644
01:46:53,583 --> 01:46:55,180
Okay, thank you.

1645
01:46:56,089 --> 01:46:57,375
All right.

1646
01:47:10,231 --> 01:47:11,680
Hot dog.

1647
01:48:01,600 --> 01:48:05,672
Just a typical homecoming...
on the outside of an invisible jet...

1648
01:48:06,648 --> 01:48:08,523
...fighting my girlfriend's dad.

1649
01:48:18,150 --> 01:48:19,231
Oh, God!

1650
01:48:26,677 --> 01:48:28,430
I can't believe that worked.

1651
01:49:05,273 --> 01:49:07,508
Chief, they're losing altitude.
Get out of there.

1652
01:49:07,533 --> 01:49:09,074
I'm not going home empty-handed.

1653
01:49:19,386 --> 01:49:20,664
Oh, my God.

1654
01:49:35,435 --> 01:49:37,150
Get out of there. What are you doing?

1655
01:49:37,174 --> 01:49:38,498
Please turn, please turn!

1656
01:51:13,343 --> 01:51:14,933
Hey, Pedro.

1657
01:52:02,633 --> 01:52:03,669
Bingo.

1658
01:52:19,669 --> 01:52:21,222
Your wingsuit.

1659
01:52:21,482 --> 01:52:23,331
Your wingsuit's going to explode!

1660
01:52:31,286 --> 01:52:32,743
Time to go home, Pete.

1661
01:52:32,913 --> 01:52:34,370
I'm trying to save you!

1662
01:52:49,596 --> 01:52:50,854
No.

1663
01:52:51,499 --> 01:52:52,792
No.

1664
01:54:32,623 --> 01:54:34,535
It looked so insane. That whole...

1665
01:54:34,771 --> 01:54:36,303
Like, it was just crazy.

1666
01:54:36,328 --> 01:54:38,081
He... He was just, like...

1667
01:54:38,755 --> 01:54:39,995
And you were like...

1668
01:54:40,931 --> 01:54:42,284
And then I just hit him with the...

1669
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:44,826
It was so... Oh, my God.

1670
01:54:45,026 --> 01:54:46,753
I mean, you saved me.

1671
01:54:47,182 --> 01:54:48,798
It was awesome.

1672
01:54:54,961 --> 01:54:56,347
Hey, Liz.

1673
01:54:58,308 --> 01:54:59,469
I'm gonna miss you.

1674
01:54:59,976 --> 01:55:01,198
Bye.

1675
01:55:02,077 --> 01:55:03,190
Liz.

1676
01:55:10,487 --> 01:55:11,925
Liz, look, I'm so sorry.

1677
01:55:12,668 --> 01:55:15,042
You say that a lot.
What are you sorry for this time?

1678
01:55:17,160 --> 01:55:18,196
The dance?

1679
01:55:19,350 --> 01:55:22,433
That was a pretty crappy thing to do.

1680
01:55:22,458 --> 01:55:23,788
Well, yeah, but I...

1681
01:55:23,959 --> 01:55:26,793
I mean, your dad...
I can't imagine what you're going through.

1682
01:55:26,818 --> 01:55:28,761
If there's anything I can do to help...

1683
01:55:29,297 --> 01:55:31,789
I guess we're moving to Oregon.

1684
01:55:31,825 --> 01:55:35,198
Mom says it's nice there, so that's cool.

1685
01:55:36,054 --> 01:55:39,651
Anyways, Dad doesn't want us here
during the trial. So...

1686
01:55:41,526 --> 01:55:43,761
Liz, I... I...

1687
01:55:44,361 --> 01:55:45,792
Bye, Peter.

1688
01:55:47,023 --> 01:55:50,128
Whatever's going on with you,
I hope you figure it out.

1689
01:56:02,914 --> 01:56:06,726
Congratulations, 
decathlon national champions.

1690
01:56:06,751 --> 01:56:08,492
Yeah!

1691
01:56:08,962 --> 01:56:11,198
I'll have to put this back
in the trophy case soon,

1692
01:56:11,223 --> 01:56:13,847
but just for motivation right now
at this practice.

1693
01:56:14,134 --> 01:56:17,728
I'm ahead of the game, but we will need
a new team captain next year.

1694
01:56:17,762 --> 01:56:20,261
So I am appointing Michelle.

1695
01:56:21,433 --> 01:56:22,565
Yeah!

1696
01:56:25,312 --> 01:56:26,519
Thank you.

1697
01:56:26,544 --> 01:56:28,183
My... My friends call me MJ.

1698
01:56:28,773 --> 01:56:30,810
I thought you didn't have any friends.

1699
01:56:30,835 --> 01:56:32,276
I didn't.

1700
01:56:37,782 --> 01:56:39,894
- I gotta go.
- Hey, where you going?

1701
01:56:42,496 --> 01:56:44,613
What are you hiding, Peter?

1702
01:56:46,917 --> 01:56:48,499
I'm just kidding. I don't care. Bye.

1703
01:56:48,524 --> 01:56:51,187
- All right, so we should run some drills.
- Yeah.

1704
01:56:59,763 --> 01:57:03,081
Hey, Happy. What...
What are you doing here?

1705
01:57:04,059 --> 01:57:05,300
I really owe you one.

1706
01:57:07,324 --> 01:57:09,611
I don't know what I would do
without this job.

1707
01:57:09,746 --> 01:57:10,995
I mean, before I met Tony-

1708
01:57:41,471 --> 01:57:43,544
So how long you been here?

1709
01:57:43,569 --> 01:57:44,765
Long enough to be awkward.

1710
01:57:44,789 --> 01:57:45,956
Boss wants to see you.

1711
01:57:46,768 --> 01:57:47,851
Is he here too?

1712
01:57:47,875 --> 01:57:49,667
In the toilet? No, he's upstate.

1713
01:57:50,188 --> 01:57:51,831
Upstate... Like, upstate-upstate?

1714
01:57:51,856 --> 01:57:53,214
Yeah, let's go.

1715
01:57:54,818 --> 01:57:55,934
Take a look.

1716
01:57:56,111 --> 01:57:57,808
It's pretty impressive, huh?

1717
01:57:58,981 --> 01:58:01,261
They just finished remodeling
the whole thing.

1718
01:58:28,101 --> 01:58:29,234
You don't see that every day.

1719
01:58:29,258 --> 01:58:30,729
Oh, there they are.

1720
01:58:31,867 --> 01:58:33,222
How was the ride up?

1721
01:58:33,898 --> 01:58:34,656
Good.

1722
01:58:34,679 --> 01:58:36,190
Give me a minute with the kid.

1723
01:58:37,188 --> 01:58:38,667
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1724
01:58:39,613 --> 01:58:40,979
I gotta talk to the kid.

1725
01:58:41,573 --> 01:58:42,799
I'll be close behind.

1726
01:58:42,824 --> 01:58:45,620
How about a loose follow?
All right? Boundaries are good.

1727
01:58:51,583 --> 01:58:54,366
Sorry I took your suit. You had it coming.

1728
01:58:54,390 --> 01:58:57,621
Actually, it turns out it was the perfect
tough-love moment that you needed.

1729
01:58:57,646 --> 01:59:00,480
To urge you on, right?
Wouldn't you think? Don't you think?

1730
01:59:00,505 --> 01:59:01,964
- I guess.
- Let's just say it was.

1731
01:59:04,471 --> 01:59:05,405
Mr. Stark, I really-

1732
01:59:05,429 --> 01:59:07,815
You screwed the pooch hard, bigtime.

1733
01:59:08,308 --> 01:59:10,118
But then you did the right thing.

1734
01:59:10,143 --> 01:59:13,307
Took the dog to the free clinic,
you raised the hybrid puppies...

1735
01:59:13,332 --> 01:59:15,175
All right, not my best analogy.

1736
01:59:16,409 --> 01:59:18,097
I was wrong about you.

1737
01:59:19,027 --> 01:59:23,042
I think, with a little more mentoring...
you could be a real asset to the team.

1738
01:59:25,700 --> 01:59:27,532
- To the... To the team?
- Yeah. Anyway,

1739
01:59:27,557 --> 01:59:30,595
there's about 50 reporters behind
that door. Real ones, not bloggers.

1740
01:59:31,114 --> 01:59:35,058
When you're ready, 
why don't you try that on?

1741
01:59:35,280 --> 01:59:39,370
And I'll introduce the world to
the newest official member of the Avengers:

1742
01:59:39,395 --> 01:59:40,909
Spider-Man.

1743
01:59:43,551 --> 01:59:44,979
I...

1744
01:59:46,641 --> 01:59:48,440
Yeah, give that a look.

1745
01:59:54,562 --> 01:59:58,115
After the press conference, Happy will
show you to your room, your new quarters.

1746
01:59:58,149 --> 02:00:00,543
Where's he between? He's next to Vision?

1747
02:00:00,568 --> 02:00:02,810
- Yeah, Vision's not big on doors.
- It's fun.

1748
02:00:02,835 --> 02:00:04,167
Or walls.

1749
02:00:04,403 --> 02:00:05,886
You'll fit right in.

1750
02:00:12,663 --> 02:00:16,397
Thank you, Mr. Stark. But I'm good.

1751
02:00:17,411 --> 02:00:19,903
You're good? Good... How are you good?

1752
02:00:20,236 --> 02:00:24,495
Well, I mean, I'd rather just stay
on the ground for a little while.

1753
02:00:24,520 --> 02:00:26,682
Friendly neighborhood Spider-Man.

1754
02:00:26,886 --> 02:00:28,843
Somebody's got to look out
for the little guy, right?

1755
02:00:29,195 --> 02:00:32,378
You're turning me down?
You better think about this. Look at that.

1756
02:00:33,066 --> 02:00:34,307
Look at me.

1757
02:00:35,186 --> 02:00:36,267
Last chance. Yes or no?

1758
02:00:36,292 --> 02:00:37,578
- No.
- Okay.

1759
02:00:37,857 --> 02:00:41,350
It's kind of a Springsteen-y,
working-class hero vibe that I dig.

1760
02:00:41,375 --> 02:00:43,367
Happy will take you home.

1761
02:00:43,737 --> 02:00:45,228
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1762
02:00:45,253 --> 02:00:47,415
Mind waiting in the car? I need a minute.

1763
02:00:49,117 --> 02:00:51,780
- Thank you, Mr. Stark.
- Yes, Mr. Parker, very well.

1764
02:00:51,805 --> 02:00:53,198
- See you around.
- Okay.

1765
02:01:01,880 --> 02:01:03,087
That was a test, right?

1766
02:01:03,882 --> 02:01:06,340
- There's nobody back there?
- Yes, you passed.

1767
02:01:07,218 --> 02:01:10,086
- All right, skedaddle there, young buck.
- Thank you, Mr. Stark.

1768
02:01:10,111 --> 02:01:11,818
Yeah, thank you.

1769
02:01:13,737 --> 02:01:15,128
Told you he's a good kid.

1770
02:01:22,192 --> 02:01:23,649
- Where's the kid?
- He left.

1771
02:01:23,674 --> 02:01:24,593
Everybody's waiting.

1772
02:01:24,611 --> 02:01:26,880
You know, he actually made 
a really mature choice.

1773
02:01:26,905 --> 02:01:28,460
It just surprised the heck out of us.

1774
02:01:28,484 --> 02:01:29,898
Did you guys screw this up?

1775
02:01:29,923 --> 02:01:32,302
- He told the kid to go wait in the car.
- Are you kidding me?

1776
02:01:32,327 --> 02:01:35,320
I have a room full of people in there
waiting for some big announcement.

1777
02:01:35,344 --> 02:01:36,487
What am I gonna tell them?

1778
02:01:36,512 --> 02:01:39,159
Think of something. How about...

1779
02:01:39,549 --> 02:01:40,975
Hap, you still got that ring?

1780
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:42,585
- Do I... I...
- The engagement ring.

1781
02:01:42,609 --> 02:01:45,925
Are you kidding? 
I've been carrying this since 2008.

1782
02:01:49,219 --> 02:01:50,477
Okay.

1783
02:01:50,512 --> 02:01:52,238
I think I can think of something 
better than that.

1784
02:01:52,263 --> 02:01:54,206
Well, it would buy us a little time.

1785
02:01:55,754 --> 02:01:57,698
Like we need time.

1786
02:01:58,228 --> 02:02:00,038
I can't believe
you have that thing in your pocket.

1787
02:02:00,063 --> 02:02:02,269
- Want me to get the door for you, hon?
- I got it.

1788
02:02:18,521 --> 02:02:20,651
Aunt May, did you do dinner already?

1789
02:02:31,281 --> 02:02:32,711
May?

1790
02:02:54,909 --> 02:02:55,857
What the f-

1791
02:05:10,044 --> 02:05:12,001
Look who it is.

1792
02:05:13,845 --> 02:05:16,559
What are the odds you and I'd end up
at the same summer camp?

1793
02:05:17,212 --> 02:05:18,498
Relax.

1794
02:05:19,178 --> 02:05:21,170
This? It's not on you.

1795
02:05:21,347 --> 02:05:24,192
It's on our little spider friend.

1796
02:05:24,600 --> 02:05:28,184
I've got some boys on the outside
who would just love to meet him.

1797
02:05:28,315 --> 02:05:31,774
You know, take a picture,
slice his throat, put his head in a dryer.

1798
02:05:32,358 --> 02:05:34,458
And I heard a rumor.

1799
02:05:37,864 --> 02:05:39,446
You know who he is.

1800
02:05:43,202 --> 02:05:47,287
If I knew who he was, he'd already be dead.

1801
02:05:51,836 --> 02:05:54,704
Toomes, your family's here!

1802
02:12:33,821 --> 02:12:36,757
Hi, I'm Captain America,
here to talk to you

1803
02:12:36,782 --> 02:12:40,669
about one of the most valuable traits 
a soldier or student can have.

1804
02:12:40,874 --> 02:12:42,266
Patience.

1805
02:12:42,788 --> 02:12:45,057
Sometimes patience is the key to victory.

1806
02:12:45,082 --> 02:12:49,125
Sometimes it leads to very little
and it seems like it's not worth it.

1807
02:12:49,795 --> 02:12:54,836
And you wonder why you waited so long 
for something so disappointing.

1808
02:12:59,013 --> 02:13:00,781
How many more of these?
