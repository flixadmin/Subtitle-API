Alma, it's just that...

That bullshit will only crush
your self-esteem and continue to...

attract attention from really bad folks,
you get that?

168

You're different, Alma.
You don't have to do what is common.

You know? I have another idea.

Maybe we could take a photo

scattered everywhere.

I mean, but I don't know,

- Nothing happened.

And so because he didn't try
anything with you,

I told you so far is bullshit?

[Mer] Did you know your friend
suffered from mental illness

319
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,480
and was receiving treatment?

320
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,360
[Alma] Yeah, she said she was

321
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,160
dealing with a lot of issues
since the abuse started.

322
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,160
Well, the thing is,

323
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,560
we couldn't find any definitive proof
that it was cause and effect.

324
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,360
I don't understand what you're saying.

325
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,120
Well, you see...

326
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,840
Berta was evaluated and diagnosed
with borderline personality disorder

327
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,560
when she was twelve years old.

328
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,800
Long before she reported your teacher.

329
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,640
What do you mean "reported"?

330
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,040
She told me that she'd never told anyone.

331
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
But she did.

332
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,680
They opened an investigation.

333
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,600
But in the end, it was determined
that the abuse never even existed.

334
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,480
Because she cleared the charges.

335
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,280
Why'd she lie?

336
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,840
[Mer] I don't know.

337
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,200
But I spent the entire night
reviewing the case,

338
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:21,280
and unfortunately, if there's no proof
or a solid accusation on record,

339
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,720
there's nothing we can do.

340
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,480

[Alma] <i>This is a fake account.</i>

344
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,640
<i>No one raped this girl.</i>

345
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,400

and her name is Alma.</i>

346
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,440
<i>Don't believe anything she tells you.</i>

347
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,280
<i>She's a liar.</i>

348
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,880
[Berta] I told you not to tell anyone.

349
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,600
García, there's a girl outside
who wants to talk to you.

350
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,440
- No time, can you take it?
- It's about Coleman Miller.

351
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,520
Hi there,

352
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,240
I'm Sergeant Mercedes García.

353
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,520
How can I help you?

354
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,080
I wanted to, um, talk about this account.

355
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,976
"We'd like to inform you
that the school board has decided

due to the violation of article 19B

in the official Student Code of Conduct."

360
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,760
[Alma] Yup.

361
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,280
Well, at least your friend
the officer was cool about it

362
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,080
and hasn't been on me
about me starting a fake account.

363
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,000
About a fake rape, I guess.

364
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,000
Berta was just going through a lot.

365
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,520
And she said
some really weird stuff, Alma.

366
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:01,000
Yeah, but she'd speak these things
with such truth in her voice.

Your brother asked me to go
with him to the end of the world.

371
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,240
And I said no. But...

372
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,800
I should probably reconsider, right?

373
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,960
Especially after all of this.

374
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,120

Look.

377
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,920
There's probably a thousand accounts
saying that they want me dead.

00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,160
What is this?

379
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,600
Um, well, I mean,
just delete those comments

380
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,840

and that's that.

who wanted to help, of being a rapist.

that's kind of incredible.</i>

632
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,080
<i>I got hired as a community manager</i>

633
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,840
for DJ Bárbara Lago.

634
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,376
So I'm going on tour with her
for three months all over Europe.

635
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:38,800
I can't believe it's real.

636
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,880
Wish me luck, guys.

637
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,240
My brother is at the ass end
of the world, now you're leaving.

638
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,880
And I'm left here.

639
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,400
You are abandoning me.

640
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,440
Has he texted you?

641
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:01,520
Has he texted you?

642
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,960
Well, the thing is
even though he won't admit it,

643
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:10,760
yeah, you definitely broke his heart.

644
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,160
At least I was honest about it.

645
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,600
It was only a fuck, right?

646
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,480
Mm-hmm?

647
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,560
Hey, I'm really gonna miss you.

648
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,200
Miss you too.

649
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:37,080
But you know, it's only three months.

650
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:42,360
Yeah? And you are gonna be
so busy with college and other stuff.

651
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,600
And besides, I'll text you
and call you all the time

652
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,600
and it'll be like I never left.

653
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:52,840
[Greta] Yeah.

654
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,216
But, I mean, if I have a weird day
and I just wanna make out with you,

655
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,480
I won't be able to
and that will make me sad.

656
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:02,600
And I might drop dead.

657
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,560
Um...

658
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,560
You have an incredible talent
for manipulation, Greta Hernández.

659
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:08,640
All right!

660
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:22,240
I know that gave you butterflies
in your stomach.

661
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,560
In the vag, actually.

662
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,840
Crazy lesbian on the loose! She's insane!

664

- Wow, what a large bag.
- Yeah? Well, It's three whole months, Dad.

665
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,480
Are you sure this
is what you really want to do?

666
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:41,600
I don't know, but I wanna give it a shot.

667
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,720
[Vero] If you have any trouble,
you come right back.

668
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,640
[Alma] Mom, relax,
nothing's gonna happen, okay?

669
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,400
Yeah, I know. You're so fearless.

670
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,480
But call me every day, all right?

671
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,920
You're so dramatic, I will.

672
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,240
All right, let's go! Come on!

673
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,040
[Alma] Come on.

674
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:57,360
Get out of my house already.
