1
00:00:01,157 --> 00:00:04,317
My name is Oliver Queen.
For 5 years,

2
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:07,686
I was stranded on an island
with only one goal--

3
00:00:07,688 --> 00:00:09,738
survive.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,523
Oliver Queen is alive.

5
00:00:11,525 --> 00:00:14,081
Now I will fulfill
my father's dying wish--

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,718
to use the list
of names he left me

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,254
and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

8
00:00:20,256 --> 00:00:23,107
To do this, I must
become someone else.

9
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:27,311
I must become
something else.

10
00:00:27,313 --> 00:00:29,263
Previously on "Arrow"...

11
00:00:29,265 --> 00:00:31,649
I'd like you to work with me
 on the Vigilante investigation.

12
00:00:31,651 --> 00:00:33,601
Thank you, sir!

13
00:00:33,603 --> 00:00:35,336
It's just beginning.
In six months,

14
00:00:35,338 --> 00:00:37,889
the organization's vision
of what this city should be

15
00:00:37,891 --> 00:00:39,607
will be complete.

16
00:00:39,609 --> 00:00:42,076
Thousands of innocent people
will be dead

17
00:00:42,078 --> 00:00:43,578
and you'll feel nothing.

18
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:45,213
That's not true.

19
00:00:45,215 --> 00:00:47,465
I'll feel a sense
of accomplishment.

20
00:00:47,467 --> 00:00:49,917
So...

21
00:00:49,919 --> 00:00:51,552
How can we be of assistance?

22
00:00:51,554 --> 00:00:55,122
Malcolm Merlyn. I want
you to kill him for me.

23
00:00:55,124 --> 00:00:57,141
These black arrows
aren't consistent with his M.O.

24
00:00:57,143 --> 00:00:58,392
Something
doesn't add up.

25
00:00:58,394 --> 00:01:01,395
We're dealing
with a copycat.

26
00:01:14,694 --> 00:01:17,144
What do you mean, the chopper's
about to touch down?

27
00:01:17,146 --> 00:01:19,163
The flight log doesn't have them
due for another 20 minutes!

28
00:01:19,165 --> 00:01:21,666
Then lock down
the heliport!

29
00:01:39,501 --> 00:01:42,503
I've just landed
in Starling City.

30
00:01:42,505 --> 00:01:45,189
We agreed--
half on arrival, the other half

31
00:01:45,191 --> 00:01:47,191
when the job is done.

32
00:01:50,896 --> 00:01:53,748
Gracias.

33
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,349
Don't worry.

34
00:01:55,351 --> 00:01:57,952
The man's as good as--

35
00:02:00,656 --> 00:02:03,324
Guillermo Barrera.

36
00:02:03,326 --> 00:02:06,544
You have failed this city.

37
00:02:06,546 --> 00:02:08,696
You've built quite
a reputation.

38
00:02:08,698 --> 00:02:10,631
And you should have
stayed overseas.

39
00:02:10,633 --> 00:02:14,368
I thought about it,
but then I remembered--

40
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:17,788
I've got
a reputation, too.

41
00:02:45,308 --> 00:02:49,308

43
00:03:09,792 --> 00:03:13,377
Ahh! Ow!

44
00:03:14,546 --> 00:03:16,914
Now the trick
is to keep your weight

45
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:18,632
evenly distributed.

46
00:03:18,634 --> 00:03:21,052
I thought the trick was
to avoid getting into fights.

47
00:03:21,054 --> 00:03:22,803
Yeah, well, Starling City's
not the kind of place

48
00:03:22,805 --> 00:03:25,039
where you can talk
your way out of trouble.

49
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:28,208
Besides, if you're going
to be working with us,

50
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:32,263
I'll sleep a lot easier knowing that
you can handle yourself...

51
00:03:32,265 --> 00:03:33,814
At least a little bit.

52
00:03:37,652 --> 00:03:39,236
How'd it go?

53
00:03:39,238 --> 00:03:41,238
Badly for him.
Who's him?

54
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,741
An assassin for hire
with an affinity for knives.

55
00:03:43,743 --> 00:03:45,659
His name was
Guillermo Barrera.

56
00:03:45,661 --> 00:03:47,244
Was?

57
00:03:47,246 --> 00:03:49,613
So we can't ask him
about his intended target?

58
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,067
No.

59
00:03:53,069 --> 00:03:54,752
Which is why I need you to
hack his phone.

60
00:03:54,754 --> 00:03:56,087
Barrera's world class.

61
00:03:56,089 --> 00:03:57,671
He kills high
profile targets.

62
00:03:57,673 --> 00:03:58,956
And whatever job
he was hired for

63
00:03:58,958 --> 00:04:00,591
isn't finished.

64
00:04:00,593 --> 00:04:02,927
We need to figure out who
he was here to kill, and fast.

65
00:04:02,929 --> 00:04:04,929
They are probably
still in danger.

66
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:06,347
Ok?
Yeah.

67
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:08,415
I have to meet McKenna.

68
00:04:08,417 --> 00:04:11,185
Good thing she didn't meet you
at the heliport.

69
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,638
May not be a good idea
to fall for the cop

70
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,090
that's hunting you down.

71
00:04:16,092 --> 00:04:18,859
Well, it's slim pickings
for us vigilantes.

72
00:04:26,234 --> 00:04:28,569
Four.

73
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:30,888
Well, I'm more of a runner.

74
00:04:35,945 --> 00:04:38,879
Why the sudden
desire to work out?

75
00:04:38,881 --> 00:04:40,498
What else is there to do?

76
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,417
Well, we can try to think of
another way off the island.

77
00:04:43,419 --> 00:04:44,668
There is no other way.

78
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,887
If there was,
I would have found it.

79
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:48,556
We can't just sit here

80
00:04:48,558 --> 00:04:51,058
and wait for Fyers
to come and kill us.

81
00:04:53,562 --> 00:04:55,596
I did have one idea.

82
00:04:55,598 --> 00:04:57,064
If you go into the forest

83
00:04:57,066 --> 00:04:58,816
and gather as much bamboo
as you can find...

84
00:04:58,818 --> 00:05:00,768
Yeah?

85
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:02,653
We could build ourselves a boat,

86
00:05:02,655 --> 00:05:04,989
like they did
on "Gilligan's Island."

87
00:05:12,164 --> 00:05:14,148
That's broken.

88
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,483
It got busted
during the crash.

89
00:05:16,485 --> 00:05:18,202
Did you try
to get it to work?

90
00:05:18,204 --> 00:05:20,955
I'm better at pulling
things apart.

91
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,258
My father was a pilot

92
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,043
and he used to do
his own maintenance.

93
00:05:26,045 --> 00:05:28,345
So you're hoping
aircraft maintenance is genetic?

94
00:05:28,347 --> 00:05:30,214
No, I used to help him
and I liked it.

95
00:05:30,216 --> 00:05:31,515
Then I got
pretty good at it.

96
00:05:31,517 --> 00:05:34,468
So maybe I can make
the radio work.

97
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,503
You should be training

98
00:05:36,505 --> 00:05:39,506
for the inevitable fight
that's looming.

99
00:05:39,508 --> 00:05:42,526
I think I have a better chance of
making the radio work.

100
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:45,946
Hey.

101
00:05:45,948 --> 00:05:47,364
Sorry I'm late.

102
00:05:47,366 --> 00:05:49,783
No, I am. I just got
caught up at the office.

103
00:05:49,785 --> 00:05:51,986
Me, too. Wow.

104
00:05:51,988 --> 00:05:53,537
You look nice.

105
00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:55,789
Ooh.

106
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:58,709
We should go inside.

107
00:05:58,711 --> 00:06:00,494
We should.

108
00:06:02,215 --> 00:06:04,965
We don't seem to be
going inside.

109
00:06:06,251 --> 00:06:08,402
Welcome.

110
00:06:08,404 --> 00:06:09,937
Happy Birthday, buddy.
Thank you.

111
00:06:11,423 --> 00:06:13,724
Oh, this feels like
a Chateauneuf de Pape.

112
00:06:13,726 --> 00:06:15,142
It's going to taste
like one, too.

113
00:06:15,144 --> 00:06:16,777
You are a true friend.
Thank you.

114
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:18,762
Tommy, you remember
McKenna Hall.

115
00:06:18,764 --> 00:06:21,482
From back in the day.
And back again.

116
00:06:24,736 --> 00:06:26,053
Ollie.

117
00:06:26,055 --> 00:06:28,022
Hi.
Hi.

118
00:06:28,024 --> 00:06:30,274
Laurel, this is...

119
00:06:30,276 --> 00:06:30,993
McKenna Hall.

120
00:06:31,018 --> 00:06:33,018
We know each other
from the court house.

121
00:06:33,112 --> 00:06:34,695
How are you,
counselor?

122
00:06:34,697 --> 00:06:36,263
I'm well, Detective.

123
00:06:36,265 --> 00:06:38,282
I'm going to go crack this open.
Come in.

124
00:06:38,284 --> 00:06:41,252
Such a nice apartment.
So much space.

125
00:06:41,254 --> 00:06:43,671
Oh, this is adorable.

126
00:06:43,673 --> 00:06:45,239
How old are you here?

127
00:06:45,241 --> 00:06:47,541
That's actually
my sister Sarah.

128
00:06:47,543 --> 00:06:49,376
Oh, I am so sorry.

129
00:06:49,378 --> 00:06:51,011
No, no, it's ok.

130
00:06:51,013 --> 00:06:53,847
I don't know why my father
bought her that canary.

131
00:06:53,849 --> 00:06:55,883
That thing chirped
night and day.

132
00:06:55,885 --> 00:06:57,017
Drove us all nuts.

133
00:06:57,019 --> 00:06:59,019
A toast.

134
00:07:00,972 --> 00:07:04,041
To the first birthday
that I have enjoyed

135
00:07:04,043 --> 00:07:05,559
in a long time.

136
00:07:05,561 --> 00:07:07,361
I got my best friend back.

137
00:07:07,363 --> 00:07:09,096
And...

138
00:07:09,098 --> 00:07:11,815
I have finally
figured out why poets

139
00:07:11,817 --> 00:07:14,485
have been in business
for the last few thousand years.

140
00:07:14,487 --> 00:07:16,603
Happy Birthday, baby.
Thank you.

141
00:07:16,605 --> 00:07:17,821
Cheers.
Cheers.

142
00:07:17,823 --> 00:07:19,540
Cheers.

143
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:21,909
I think that's the food.
Oh, ok.

144
00:07:23,461 --> 00:07:25,829
Oh, thank God,
she didn't cook.

145
00:07:25,831 --> 00:07:27,248
Amen.

146
00:07:30,085 --> 00:07:33,053
Mr. Merlyn.

147
00:07:33,055 --> 00:07:35,889
Laurel.
Can I come in?

148
00:07:43,932 --> 00:07:46,100
Oliver.

149
00:07:46,102 --> 00:07:47,484
Mr. Merlyn.

150
00:07:47,486 --> 00:07:50,237
I've been trying
to get in touch with you.

151
00:07:50,239 --> 00:07:53,240
What are you
doing here, Dad?

152
00:07:53,242 --> 00:07:55,776
Happy Birthday, Tommy.

153
00:07:56,911 --> 00:07:59,179
Just give us
a second.

154
00:07:59,181 --> 00:08:02,082
Of course.

155
00:08:07,372 --> 00:08:09,506
We're about to eat.
I can't stay.

156
00:08:09,508 --> 00:08:13,010
Well, that works out
because you weren't invited.

157
00:08:13,012 --> 00:08:16,597
I'm being honored by the
Starling City Municipal Group.

158
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:18,999
They're bestowing me with
their annual Humanitarian Award.

159
00:08:19,001 --> 00:08:21,852
What, they ran out of actual
humans to give it to?

160
00:08:21,854 --> 00:08:25,105
I would like you
to be there, if you could.

161
00:08:25,107 --> 00:08:28,942
I am 100% certain
that I'll be busy.

162
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,514
You might not
believe this,

163
00:08:34,516 --> 00:08:37,117
but all I ever wanted
for you was happiness.

164
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,620
If it will allay
this tension between us,

165
00:08:39,622 --> 00:08:40,871
I'll turn
the switch back on.

166
00:08:40,873 --> 00:08:42,239
Save your money, Dad.

167
00:08:42,241 --> 00:08:44,291
I don't need it anymore.

168
00:08:44,293 --> 00:08:48,078
I'd still like you
to come to the event.

169
00:08:49,381 --> 00:08:53,050
It would mean
a lot to me.

170
00:08:53,052 --> 00:08:54,835
You know what, Dad?

171
00:08:57,972 --> 00:09:01,675
Sometimes the people
that you want there the most...

172
00:09:01,677 --> 00:09:03,510
Aren't.

173
00:09:03,512 --> 00:09:06,347
You taught me that.

174
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:09,600
Multiple times.

175
00:09:39,764 --> 00:09:41,799
Hello, Lawton.

176
00:09:41,801 --> 00:09:44,718
I see your edge has dulled.

177
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,970
Oh, I knew
you were there.

178
00:09:46,972 --> 00:09:49,606
I just didn't care
if you killed me.

179
00:09:49,608 --> 00:09:52,776
What do you want?

180
00:09:52,778 --> 00:09:55,279
My organization
has been contracted

181
00:09:55,281 --> 00:09:58,866
to eliminate a certain
high profile individual.

182
00:09:58,868 --> 00:10:01,385
A very well-guarded target.

183
00:10:01,387 --> 00:10:03,237
Well, forget it.

184
00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:04,822
Look, I'm retired.

185
00:10:04,824 --> 00:10:07,774
To drink and smoke
your life away?

186
00:10:07,776 --> 00:10:09,326
We all got to die
some time.

187
00:10:09,328 --> 00:10:12,196
I need someone to die
at the right time.

188
00:10:12,198 --> 00:10:14,798
And no one does it
better than you.

189
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,117
My vision...

190
00:10:17,119 --> 00:10:19,720
ain't exactly
what it used to be.

191
00:10:19,722 --> 00:10:21,138
No.

192
00:10:23,925 --> 00:10:27,511
It's going to be better.

193
00:10:29,264 --> 00:10:31,515
So...

194
00:10:31,517 --> 00:10:35,436
Who needs two bullets
in the chest?

195
00:10:37,272 --> 00:10:39,440
Moira.

196
00:10:39,442 --> 00:10:41,108
Is it happening?

197
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,359
Yes.

198
00:10:42,361 --> 00:10:43,977
The Humanitarian Award ceremony.

199
00:10:43,979 --> 00:10:45,996
Isn't that
a little public?

200
00:10:45,998 --> 00:10:48,999
No one will expect it.

201
00:10:50,368 --> 00:10:54,838
I have very welcome news
to share with all of you.

202
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,374
Thanks to Queen Consolidated's
Applied Sciences Division

203
00:10:57,376 --> 00:11:00,711
and their recent acquisition
of Unidac Industries,

204
00:11:00,713 --> 00:11:03,096
the Undertaking
which we set for ourselves

205
00:11:03,098 --> 00:11:06,183
is only months
from fruition.

206
00:11:06,185 --> 00:11:10,137
There's hope on the horizon
for everyone in starling.

207
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:13,440
We won't fail this city.

208
00:11:14,943 --> 00:11:18,896
And I think I speak
for everyone here

209
00:11:18,898 --> 00:11:22,449
when I say we're all
with you, Malcolm.

210
00:11:31,373 --> 00:11:33,756
Jeez, this is one
paranoid assassin.

211
00:11:33,758 --> 00:11:36,209
Barerra's got cobalt-level
encryption on his phone.

212
00:11:36,211 --> 00:11:38,795
It's not going
to be easy to break.

213
00:11:38,797 --> 00:11:41,456
But codebreaker
is my middle name.

214
00:11:41,481 --> 00:11:43,017
Actually, it's Megan--

215
00:11:43,018 --> 00:11:44,717
Felicity, can you get
anything off of it?

216
00:11:44,719 --> 00:11:47,003
Just the last number
he dialed.

217
00:11:47,005 --> 00:11:50,390
Which was?
A restaurant in China town.

218
00:11:50,392 --> 00:11:53,026
A Jade Dragon.
I guess even hired killers

219
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:54,360
enjoy the city's best chow mien.

220
00:11:54,362 --> 00:11:55,812
Yeah, Jade Dragon
is a front

221
00:11:55,814 --> 00:11:57,847
for the Chinese
mafia.

222
00:11:57,849 --> 00:12:01,034
Call the restaurant, make
a reservation for two for tonight.

223
00:12:01,036 --> 00:12:03,486
You need to decrypt that phone.

224
00:12:05,072 --> 00:12:07,440
I'm kind of in the mood
for Chinese now.

225
00:12:07,442 --> 00:12:08,958
Hmm.

226
00:12:21,256 --> 00:12:24,223
That is--that is
one big fried fish.

227
00:12:24,225 --> 00:12:27,143
I was told this was the most
authentic Szechwan in town.

228
00:12:27,145 --> 00:12:30,013
Whatever. I wanted to make sure
that your birthday celebration

229
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:31,464
got its due celebration.

230
00:12:31,466 --> 00:12:34,067
It was a little bit, um,
tense last night.

231
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:35,935
Well, trust my dad to run
all the smiles out of the room.

232
00:12:35,937 --> 00:12:38,387
He did come by,

233
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:40,656
and it seemed like
he was trying

234
00:12:40,658 --> 00:12:42,658
to act a little bit dad-like.

235
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,411
Dad-like, that sums up
my father perfectly.

236
00:12:45,413 --> 00:12:47,280
I know the two of you
have never been close,

237
00:12:47,282 --> 00:12:49,365
but it couldn't have been
easy for him

238
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:51,284
after your mom was killed.

239
00:12:51,286 --> 00:12:54,037
Yeah, I guess he forgot that there
were two of us in that club.

240
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:56,339
I'm not defending him, Tommy.

241
00:12:56,341 --> 00:12:58,174
It's...

242
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:02,795
With everything
I've been through,

243
00:13:02,797 --> 00:13:04,747
people that I've lost...

244
00:13:04,749 --> 00:13:07,433
I know how hard it can be.

245
00:13:07,435 --> 00:13:10,770
You probably don't
remember this.

246
00:13:10,772 --> 00:13:13,139
Ahh...

247
00:13:13,141 --> 00:13:14,657
We were eight.

248
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:16,325
But after her funeral,

249
00:13:16,327 --> 00:13:20,646
he left for like
two years.

250
00:13:20,648 --> 00:13:23,066
And when
he did come back,

251
00:13:23,068 --> 00:13:25,184
he was...

252
00:13:25,186 --> 00:13:28,221
he was so frickin' cold.

253
00:13:28,223 --> 00:13:30,673
We barely spoke.

254
00:13:30,675 --> 00:13:33,209
And that's why I spent so much
time at your house.

255
00:13:33,211 --> 00:13:36,629
From the outside,

256
00:13:36,631 --> 00:13:39,749
it always looked
like I had a father.

257
00:13:39,751 --> 00:13:42,301
He paid my bills,

258
00:13:42,303 --> 00:13:45,972
he lived in the house,
he bailed me out.

259
00:13:45,974 --> 00:13:50,560
But your dad took me
to my first hockey game.

260
00:13:50,562 --> 00:13:53,262
Your dad taught me
how to fly fish.

261
00:13:53,264 --> 00:13:56,265
Your dad took us
to our first R-rated movie.

262
00:13:56,267 --> 00:13:59,819
Your dad taught me
but he wasn't perfect.

263
00:13:59,821 --> 00:14:03,022
My dad made mistakes.

264
00:14:03,024 --> 00:14:06,075
And...

265
00:14:06,077 --> 00:14:11,330
We haven't talked
about this.

266
00:14:11,332 --> 00:14:15,001
But I have a lot
of anger towards him.

267
00:14:15,003 --> 00:14:19,005
But still, I would give anything

268
00:14:19,007 --> 00:14:22,258
to have him back,
because...

269
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:26,596
At the end of the day,
your dad is...

270
00:14:26,598 --> 00:14:30,600
Your dad.

271
00:14:34,438 --> 00:14:37,773
I meant what I said
last night.

272
00:14:37,775 --> 00:14:39,725
I'm...

273
00:14:39,727 --> 00:14:41,978
really glad
that you're back.

274
00:14:51,905 --> 00:14:55,074
I got to hit the restroom.

275
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:58,054
Check, please.

276
00:16:07,147 --> 00:16:11,200
I hope you like
barbecue.

277
00:16:11,202 --> 00:16:13,602
Well, don't fall over
yourself thanking me

278
00:16:13,604 --> 00:16:15,488
for spending six hours up a tree
so you can eat.

279
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,156
What?

280
00:16:17,158 --> 00:16:19,659
Great. I'll eat later.

281
00:16:19,661 --> 00:16:23,045
You've been on that for days.
Give it a rest.

282
00:16:23,047 --> 00:16:24,664
It's because I can do this.

283
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:27,550
Sure, kid. When pigs fly.

284
00:16:31,588 --> 00:16:33,889
You're kidding me.

285
00:16:34,841 --> 00:16:36,976
Can you clean this up?

286
00:16:36,978 --> 00:16:39,345
I don't know. I don't know
how I got this far!

287
00:16:39,347 --> 00:16:42,898
Continue
approach. Big jet 365.

288
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,685
Mayday,
mayday, mayday.

289
00:16:45,687 --> 00:16:48,154
This is wedgetail 325.

290
00:16:48,156 --> 00:16:50,139
Pilot
and passenger down.

291
00:16:50,141 --> 00:16:51,857
Big jet 365, cleared to land.

292
00:16:51,859 --> 00:16:54,660
Runway 2-7 right, wind,

293
00:16:54,662 --> 00:16:56,412
2-7-0 degrees, 10 knots.

294
00:16:56,414 --> 00:16:59,248
I repeat--pilot
and passenger down

295
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,317
on the island
of Lian Yu.

296
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:03,419
Request
immediate rescue.

297
00:17:03,421 --> 00:17:05,621
Cleared to land,
runway 2-7 right.

298
00:17:05,623 --> 00:17:08,657
Big jet 365.
Damn!

299
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:11,677
They can't hear us,
and we can't call out.

300
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,130
We're still trapped.

301
00:17:19,052 --> 00:17:21,053
Lance.

302
00:17:21,055 --> 00:17:23,222
The Triad have hired
a contract killer.

303
00:17:23,224 --> 00:17:25,174
Yeah? You mean the one
you put in the morgue?

304
00:17:25,176 --> 00:17:27,476
Congratulations, you're the talk
of the station again.

305
00:17:27,478 --> 00:17:30,363
They hired one,
they're going to hire another, Detective.

306
00:17:30,365 --> 00:17:31,947
Who's your target?

307
00:17:31,949 --> 00:17:33,682
I'm trying to find out
but I'm hitting dead ends.

308
00:17:33,684 --> 00:17:35,401
I need you to put
your people on it.

309
00:17:35,403 --> 00:17:37,186
My people don't work for you.

310
00:17:37,188 --> 00:17:38,954
And come to think of it,
neither do I.

311
00:17:38,956 --> 00:17:40,706
It's not about you
and me, Detective.

312
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:43,409
It's about
saving a life.

313
00:17:43,411 --> 00:17:46,879
Call me back
when you got a name.

314
00:17:46,881 --> 00:17:48,581
Hall.

315
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,082
Yes, sir?

316
00:17:50,084 --> 00:17:52,251
You and me.
We're going to catch

317
00:17:52,253 --> 00:17:54,553
that Vigilante.

318
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:59,141
There are five exit routes
from the main floor

319
00:17:59,143 --> 00:18:00,676
that need to be cut off.

320
00:18:00,678 --> 00:18:02,544
Once the fire alarm goes off,

321
00:18:02,546 --> 00:18:04,263
we'll have less
than 30 seconds

322
00:18:04,265 --> 00:18:06,816
to disable Merlyn's
private security

323
00:18:06,818 --> 00:18:09,769
and force him outside
with the others.

324
00:18:09,771 --> 00:18:12,488
Once he's outside...

325
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:16,525
The rest will be
up to Mr. Lawton.

326
00:18:18,528 --> 00:18:21,347
Roger that.

327
00:19:13,381 --> 00:19:15,551
You look handsome!

328
00:19:15,552 --> 00:19:17,385
I try not to.
It just keeps happening.

329
00:19:17,387 --> 00:19:19,470
What's the occasion?

330
00:19:19,472 --> 00:19:22,056
I decided to go
to my dad's thing.

331
00:19:22,058 --> 00:19:24,091
Really?

332
00:19:24,093 --> 00:19:26,144
Are you sure?

333
00:19:26,146 --> 00:19:27,678
Oh, mostly.

334
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,463
Did you want me
to go with you?

335
00:19:29,465 --> 00:19:31,232
No, no, no, I know
you have work to do.

336
00:19:31,234 --> 00:19:33,317
I promise
I will be fine.

337
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,682
You look beautiful.

338
00:20:07,135 --> 00:20:08,519
Thank you.

339
00:20:08,521 --> 00:20:11,222
If you're free,

340
00:20:11,224 --> 00:20:14,058
maybe after the ceremony,
we could have dinner

341
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,610
and talk like we used to.

342
00:20:15,612 --> 00:20:17,612
I'd like that.

343
00:20:17,614 --> 00:20:20,314
That's my cue.

344
00:20:27,823 --> 00:20:30,958
I've been trying to avoid
him all evening.

345
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,245
If we didn't show,
it'd look suspicious.

346
00:20:34,247 --> 00:20:36,547
How can you talk
to him that way?

347
00:20:36,549 --> 00:20:37,942
As if nothing's
about to happen?

348
00:20:37,943 --> 00:20:39,596
I've been living this life
for five years.

349
00:20:39,621 --> 00:20:41,019
Five more minutes won't matter.

350
00:20:41,704 --> 00:20:43,721
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

351
00:20:43,723 --> 00:20:47,425
Now tonight's honoree
needs very little introduction.

352
00:20:47,427 --> 00:20:50,811
It's neither his wealth
nor his name

353
00:20:50,813 --> 00:20:52,763
that we celebrate here tonight.

354
00:20:52,765 --> 00:20:54,398
But it is his efforts

355
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,450
in making Starling City a better

356
00:20:56,452 --> 00:20:59,270
and safer place to live.

357
00:20:59,272 --> 00:21:01,656
So please help me welcome

358
00:21:01,658 --> 00:21:04,242
Starling City's
humanitarian of the year,

359
00:21:04,244 --> 00:21:06,444
Mr. Malcolm Merlyn.

360
00:21:28,885 --> 00:21:31,519
And so that's a stage, right.

361
00:21:31,521 --> 00:21:33,971
Most nights we'll have a band.

362
00:21:33,973 --> 00:21:35,890
Somebody cool.
Is Fallout Boy still cool?

363
00:21:35,892 --> 00:21:37,692
They broke up.

364
00:21:37,694 --> 00:21:40,094
And never.

365
00:21:40,096 --> 00:21:44,365
So somebody else
will pick the bands.

366
00:21:45,751 --> 00:21:47,952
Something
bothering you?

367
00:21:47,954 --> 00:21:50,788
Don't say no, 'cause you're
a terrible liar.

368
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,773
Really?

369
00:21:52,775 --> 00:21:54,542
I thought I was
getting better at it.

370
00:21:54,544 --> 00:21:57,211
Mm-mmm.
What's wrong?

371
00:21:58,597 --> 00:22:01,832
There's a lot of stuff
going on in my life.

372
00:22:01,834 --> 00:22:03,501
Work.

373
00:22:03,503 --> 00:22:06,053
Friends.

374
00:22:07,506 --> 00:22:10,341
And I'm having a...

375
00:22:10,343 --> 00:22:15,179
difficult time figuring out
how to fit it all in.

376
00:22:16,248 --> 00:22:17,682
I've been struggling

377
00:22:17,684 --> 00:22:19,066
with some of those
thoughts, as well.

378
00:22:19,068 --> 00:22:20,635
Do you have any good ideas?

379
00:22:20,637 --> 00:22:22,853
I think we just have
to be really honest

380
00:22:22,855 --> 00:22:24,905
about what's going
on in our lives.

381
00:22:24,907 --> 00:22:27,992
Think you can do that?

382
00:22:29,828 --> 00:22:32,079
Come on.

383
00:22:32,081 --> 00:22:33,614
I'm in! Yes!

384
00:22:33,616 --> 00:22:35,783
Yes! Yes, way to go,

385
00:22:35,785 --> 00:22:37,501
Felicity Smoak.

386
00:22:37,503 --> 00:22:40,037
You don't happen
to speak Spanish, do you?

387
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:41,455
Arabic.

388
00:22:41,457 --> 00:22:43,841
Oh, le sigh.

389
00:22:46,678 --> 00:22:49,714
Oh, my God.

390
00:22:49,716 --> 00:22:51,599
You know
I'm there for you.

391
00:22:52,884 --> 00:22:55,219
Excuse me, Mr. Queen.

392
00:22:55,221 --> 00:22:59,339
The I.T. department
has that item that you requested.

393
00:22:59,341 --> 00:23:00,891
One sec.
Ok.

394
00:23:03,979 --> 00:23:05,512
You find the target?

395
00:23:05,514 --> 00:23:07,565
Oliver, the target
is Tommy's father.

396
00:23:07,567 --> 00:23:10,484
At the awards ceremony?

397
00:23:10,486 --> 00:23:12,737
Tommy's there.

398
00:23:12,739 --> 00:23:14,822
Um, McKenna, Mr. Diggle
is going to take you home.

399
00:23:14,824 --> 00:23:17,308
I have some unexpected business.

400
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,627
It's ok.

401
00:23:21,497 --> 00:23:23,247
Lance.

402
00:23:23,249 --> 00:23:25,199
Target is Malcolm Merlyn.

403
00:23:25,201 --> 00:23:27,635
Establish a perimeter
but keep your distance.

404
00:23:27,637 --> 00:23:30,137
I don't want the police
caught in the crossfire.

405
00:23:30,139 --> 00:23:32,673
The true humanitarian
in the Merlyn family

406
00:23:32,675 --> 00:23:34,909
was my wife Rebecca.

407
00:23:34,911 --> 00:23:37,812
Many of you here
knew her.

408
00:23:37,814 --> 00:23:39,379
She tirelessly
devoted herself

409
00:23:39,381 --> 00:23:42,266
to helping those less
fortunate in the glades.

410
00:23:42,268 --> 00:23:45,319
I like to think that if the men
who murdered her

411
00:23:45,321 --> 00:23:46,721
knew her;

412
00:23:46,723 --> 00:23:48,723
knew the work
that she did,

413
00:23:48,725 --> 00:23:51,442
knew the person
that she was...

414
00:23:51,444 --> 00:23:55,246
He would have helped her to her car,
made sure she was safe,

415
00:23:55,248 --> 00:23:58,249
instead of stealing her
purse and shooting her.

416
00:24:04,956 --> 00:24:08,709
The truth is, I haven't done
enough for this city.

417
00:24:08,711 --> 00:24:11,011
My city.

418
00:24:11,013 --> 00:24:13,631
I failed it.

419
00:24:13,633 --> 00:24:15,182
But I promise you--

420
00:24:15,184 --> 00:24:16,684
I am not finished yet.

421
00:24:16,686 --> 00:24:18,585
I promise you
that this city

422
00:24:18,587 --> 00:24:21,489
will be better
for all of us.

423
00:24:21,491 --> 00:24:24,258
And on that day,
I will look

424
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:28,679
at this beautiful award
and feel that I have earned it.

425
00:24:28,681 --> 00:24:31,048
I thank you.

426
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,494
Oh!

427
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,718
Mr. Merlyn, you should
head for the exit--

428
00:24:55,006 --> 00:24:57,057
Tommy!

429
00:25:16,453 --> 00:25:19,505
Merlyn's not taking the bait.
Change of plans.

430
00:25:19,507 --> 00:25:21,590
I don't like improvisation.

431
00:25:21,592 --> 00:25:23,625
Drive him upstairs
to his penthouse office.

432
00:25:23,627 --> 00:25:25,928
I need to switch
vantage points.

433
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,963
Tommy!

434
00:25:29,883 --> 00:25:32,368
Tommy!

435
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:34,603
Come with me.

436
00:25:36,189 --> 00:25:37,639
There's an exit
on the second floor.

437
00:25:37,641 --> 00:25:41,060
I wasn't leaving
until I knew you were safe.

438
00:25:56,109 --> 00:25:59,628
Go somewhere safe.
I'll hold them off.

439
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:02,164
Go now!
Come on!

440
00:26:03,449 --> 00:26:05,501
Where are we going?
Up.

441
00:26:05,503 --> 00:26:07,169
Who are those guys?
I don't know.

442
00:26:07,171 --> 00:26:08,420
They're trying to kill you!

443
00:26:08,422 --> 00:26:09,972
Seems that way.

444
00:26:09,974 --> 00:26:11,807
And we're going up,
without any of your bodyguards?

445
00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:14,009
Dad! We need
to get out of here.

446
00:26:14,011 --> 00:26:16,895
Tommy, take a deep
breath and trust me.

447
00:26:16,897 --> 00:26:19,314
Upstairs in my office
is a panic room.

448
00:26:19,316 --> 00:26:22,901
We get there,
we seal it off.

449
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:26,488
Merlyn's headed
to the penthouse.

450
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:43,705
Why do you want
Malcolm Merlyn dead?

451
00:26:43,707 --> 00:26:47,426
I'll settle for you.

452
00:27:13,203 --> 00:27:15,370
Wait!

453
00:27:15,372 --> 00:27:17,790
Go!
You killed him!

454
00:27:17,792 --> 00:27:19,958
Surely as he would have
killed you.

455
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,877
Move, move, move!

456
00:27:26,499 --> 00:27:28,801
Electromagnetic locks.

457
00:27:28,803 --> 00:27:30,368
What if they
cut the power?

458
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:32,171
This floor is on
an entire separate grid.

459
00:27:32,173 --> 00:27:33,371
The glass?

460
00:27:33,373 --> 00:27:36,875
Lexan. Bulletproof.
It's over.

461
00:27:36,877 --> 00:27:37,849
How did you know
how to do that?

462
00:27:37,874 --> 00:27:39,262
What?

463
00:27:39,263 --> 00:27:41,246
Fight.

464
00:27:41,248 --> 00:27:43,232
Kill.

465
00:27:54,027 --> 00:27:56,745
Dad?

466
00:28:20,703 --> 00:28:23,956
Freeze! SCPD.

467
00:28:23,958 --> 00:28:25,724
Put the bow down.

468
00:28:31,814 --> 00:28:34,199
Tommy, you ok?

469
00:28:45,912 --> 00:28:47,796
Dad!

470
00:28:53,636 --> 00:28:55,971
Dad?!

471
00:29:01,476 --> 00:29:03,343
Turn around slowly.

472
00:29:15,407 --> 00:29:16,774
Dad.

473
00:29:16,776 --> 00:29:18,325
I'm sorry.

474
00:29:18,327 --> 00:29:19,860
I'm ok.

475
00:29:19,862 --> 00:29:21,862
I'm ok.

476
00:29:28,787 --> 00:29:31,571
Damn it.

477
00:29:31,573 --> 00:29:34,541
You're bleeding.
You're bleeding.

478
00:29:34,543 --> 00:29:37,711
I'll be fine, Tom.

479
00:29:37,713 --> 00:29:40,464
No, no, no, Dad!

480
00:29:40,466 --> 00:29:43,016
Dad!

481
00:29:43,018 --> 00:29:44,885
No!

482
00:29:44,887 --> 00:29:46,637
Stay back.

483
00:29:46,639 --> 00:29:49,323
I'm not here to hurt
you or your father.

484
00:29:49,325 --> 00:29:52,476
I said stay back.

485
00:29:56,731 --> 00:29:59,149
Curare.

486
00:29:59,151 --> 00:30:00,767
Don't come any closer.

487
00:30:00,769 --> 00:30:02,486
Your father's
been poisoned.

488
00:30:02,488 --> 00:30:05,405
An assassin named Floyd Lawton
laces his bullets with curare.

489
00:30:05,407 --> 00:30:06,281
I've dealt with this before.

490
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:08,441
We need to dilute the poison
in his bloodstream.

491
00:30:08,828 --> 00:30:10,694
I said stay the hell back!

492
00:30:10,696 --> 00:30:12,663
In three minutes
he's paralyzed.

493
00:30:12,665 --> 00:30:14,648
In four minutes,
he suffocates.

494
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,467
If you don't let me
help you now,

495
00:30:16,469 --> 00:30:18,552
he's dead before
anybody gets here!

496
00:30:18,554 --> 00:30:21,788
Help. How?

497
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:24,424
Fresh blood buys him time
to get to the hospital.

498
00:30:24,426 --> 00:30:27,761
A blood transfusion?

499
00:30:27,763 --> 00:30:29,847
That's insane!

500
00:30:29,849 --> 00:30:31,648
It's the only way.

501
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:33,734
He needs your blood.

502
00:30:33,736 --> 00:30:35,569
You're out of time.

503
00:30:35,571 --> 00:30:38,405
You need to make
a decision right now.

504
00:30:38,407 --> 00:30:40,407
Why should I trust you?!

505
00:30:50,168 --> 00:30:53,921
Because you always have.

506
00:30:53,923 --> 00:30:56,590
Oliver.

507
00:31:16,444 --> 00:31:19,396
Ok. Ready?

508
00:31:19,398 --> 00:31:20,948
Do it.

509
00:31:43,388 --> 00:31:46,256
Hold his arm.

510
00:31:54,482 --> 00:31:57,067
Come on, come on, come on.

511
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,572
You're the Vigilante.

512
00:32:01,574 --> 00:32:04,441
Why?

513
00:32:05,493 --> 00:32:07,411
Later.

514
00:32:07,413 --> 00:32:09,246
He's still going to need
medical attention

515
00:32:09,248 --> 00:32:11,865
to fully clean out
his system, you understand?

516
00:32:11,867 --> 00:32:13,750
Ok.

517
00:32:13,752 --> 00:32:15,869
Thank you.

518
00:32:24,295 --> 00:32:25,963
Tommy.

519
00:32:25,965 --> 00:32:28,298
I'm right here, Dad.

520
00:32:37,091 --> 00:32:38,859
What did the Hood
say to you?

521
00:32:38,861 --> 00:32:40,277
He didn't say anything.

522
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:42,262
You let a homicidal
maniac talk you into

523
00:32:42,264 --> 00:32:43,647
a homemade blood
transfusion

524
00:32:43,649 --> 00:32:44,865
instead of calling
the paramedics?

525
00:32:44,867 --> 00:32:46,900
My father's life
was at stake.

526
00:32:46,902 --> 00:32:50,821
So first the Hood rescues you
and Queen from those kidnappers,

527
00:32:50,823 --> 00:32:53,156
now he saves
your old man.

528
00:32:53,158 --> 00:32:56,960
But he's taking down every
other one percenter out there.

529
00:32:56,962 --> 00:33:00,631
Is this guy a friend
of yours, Merlyn?

530
00:33:00,633 --> 00:33:04,084
I don't know
who the hell he is.

531
00:33:22,737 --> 00:33:26,323
If they can't hear us,
then what's the point?

532
00:33:26,325 --> 00:33:28,859
Wait!

533
00:33:28,861 --> 00:33:30,494
You still might have
done us some good.

534
00:33:30,496 --> 00:33:32,812
0500 hours from my mark.

535
00:33:32,814 --> 00:33:34,915
Final deployment
is five by five.

536
00:33:34,917 --> 00:33:36,700
That's Fyers!

537
00:33:36,702 --> 00:33:39,202
I'm tuned into
the soldier's frequency.

538
00:33:39,204 --> 00:33:41,922
Scylla is in route.
ETA 0600 hours.

539
00:33:41,924 --> 00:33:43,590
At the southwest bay.

540
00:33:43,592 --> 00:33:45,258
I'll call you when Scylla
is in my possession.

541
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,277
Fyers out.

542
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:49,396
Who was Fyers talking to?

543
00:33:49,398 --> 00:33:50,764
I don't know.

544
00:33:50,766 --> 00:33:52,432
Sounds like someone
off this island,

545
00:33:52,434 --> 00:33:54,468
maybe his benefactor.
More importantly,

546
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:56,186
who or what is Scylla?

547
00:33:56,188 --> 00:33:58,021
The Scylla and Charibdis.

548
00:33:58,023 --> 00:34:02,309
It's "The Odyssey," from one
of the four nightmare chapters.

549
00:34:02,311 --> 00:34:05,312
Scylla was a monster.

550
00:34:06,364 --> 00:34:10,367
I want to meet
this monster.

551
00:34:10,369 --> 00:34:13,537
Am I going alone?

552
00:34:31,831 --> 00:34:33,500
So how's it feel
to save a one percenter?

553
00:34:33,501 --> 00:34:35,084
Looks like Malcolm Meryln's
going to be ok.

554
00:34:35,086 --> 00:34:36,669
They took him
to Starling General.

555
00:34:36,671 --> 00:34:39,021
Good thing he was wearing
a bulletproof vest.

556
00:34:39,023 --> 00:34:42,040
He's not in the hospital
because he was shot.

557
00:34:42,042 --> 00:34:45,227
He was poisoned
by curare.

558
00:35:00,577 --> 00:35:03,195
Lawton's alive.

559
00:35:03,197 --> 00:35:06,248
I'm sorry, John.

560
00:35:15,959 --> 00:35:19,628
This Lawton kick his dog
or something?

561
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,797
No.

562
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,718
He killed his brother.

563
00:35:32,642 --> 00:35:34,944
What?

564
00:35:34,946 --> 00:35:37,313
What is it?

565
00:35:37,315 --> 00:35:39,198
You were right.

566
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,367
Scylla is a monster.

567
00:35:41,369 --> 00:35:43,118
A Russian-made S300

568
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,771
anti-aircraft
missile launcher.

569
00:35:45,773 --> 00:35:49,291
It can simultaneously track
up to a hundred targets

570
00:35:49,293 --> 00:35:52,044
while engaging
with at least a dozen.

571
00:35:52,046 --> 00:35:54,413
I mean, from here,

572
00:35:54,415 --> 00:35:56,999
they could shoot down
a commercial airliner,

573
00:35:57,001 --> 00:36:00,302
or start a war.

574
00:36:04,391 --> 00:36:07,977
Hey, you're here.
Yeah.

575
00:36:07,979 --> 00:36:10,145
Walk with me.
Mm-hmm.

576
00:36:10,147 --> 00:36:11,897
I heard you were
there, are you ok?

577
00:36:11,899 --> 00:36:13,148
I'm fine. Fine.

578
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,933
Listen, McKenna, I'm--

579
00:36:14,935 --> 00:36:17,736
I'm really sorry that I had to run
out on you like that.

580
00:36:17,738 --> 00:36:19,355
Don't worry.
Five more minutes,

581
00:36:19,357 --> 00:36:21,690
and I would have had
to run out on you.

582
00:36:22,692 --> 00:36:26,411
Our lives
are complicated.

583
00:36:30,532 --> 00:36:32,784
But I'm willing
to figure us out.

584
00:36:32,786 --> 00:36:34,952
If you are.

585
00:36:37,089 --> 00:36:40,108
Willing and able.

586
00:36:48,635 --> 00:36:50,051
Hey. Hey, Dad.

587
00:36:50,053 --> 00:36:51,386
Dad, Dad.

588
00:36:51,388 --> 00:36:53,855
Take it easy.

589
00:36:53,857 --> 00:36:55,840
You were shot.

590
00:36:55,842 --> 00:36:58,643
The bullet was
laced with poison.

591
00:36:58,645 --> 00:37:01,229
I should be dead.

592
00:37:02,398 --> 00:37:04,816
I gave you
a blood transfusion.

593
00:37:06,235 --> 00:37:08,286
Actually it was...

594
00:37:08,288 --> 00:37:11,239
the Vigilante's idea.

595
00:37:11,241 --> 00:37:13,207
He saved you.

596
00:37:13,209 --> 00:37:15,676
He did?

597
00:37:15,678 --> 00:37:19,047
I was worried I was
going to lose you.

598
00:37:19,049 --> 00:37:21,049
I'm not going anywhere.

599
00:37:21,051 --> 00:37:24,602
You said that
after mom died.

600
00:37:24,604 --> 00:37:27,405
But you left.

601
00:37:27,407 --> 00:37:28,954
I wasn't a very good father

602
00:37:28,979 --> 00:37:30,830
to you after your mother
passed away.

603
00:37:32,178 --> 00:37:34,629
I was so lost.

604
00:37:34,631 --> 00:37:37,832
You never told me
where you went.

605
00:37:42,905 --> 00:37:47,175
I found myself in a place
called Nanda Parbat.

606
00:37:48,961 --> 00:37:52,447
I met a man there.

607
00:37:52,449 --> 00:37:56,501
He helped me
make sense of things.

608
00:37:56,503 --> 00:38:01,722
He helped me to find
a purpose for my life;

609
00:38:01,724 --> 00:38:05,610
to make this city
a better place for everyone.

610
00:38:05,612 --> 00:38:10,131
Especially for you.

611
00:38:10,133 --> 00:38:13,634
How are you going
to do that?

612
00:38:13,636 --> 00:38:17,021
Malcolm?

613
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:20,525
Tommy.

614
00:38:20,527 --> 00:38:23,978
Could I talk to Moira
for a minute?

615
00:38:40,612 --> 00:38:43,965
Thank God
you're all right.

616
00:38:43,967 --> 00:38:46,884
We have a traitor
in our midst.

617
00:38:46,886 --> 00:38:49,053
I want you to find out who.

618
00:38:49,055 --> 00:38:53,724
He just made his last mistake.

619
00:39:01,967 --> 00:39:05,970
My dad's going to be ok,
thanks to you.

620
00:39:05,972 --> 00:39:09,190
It's thanks to you.

621
00:39:09,192 --> 00:39:13,110
No one's asked you what happened
to you out on that island.

622
00:39:13,112 --> 00:39:15,646
You said "a lot."
That doesn't quite cover it.

623
00:39:15,648 --> 00:39:17,165
Tommy...

624
00:39:17,167 --> 00:39:18,816
I saw you
kill those guys

625
00:39:18,818 --> 00:39:22,203
who kidnapped us when you
first got back, didn't I?

626
00:39:27,259 --> 00:39:29,844
I...

627
00:39:29,846 --> 00:39:32,013
I know you have
a lot of questions.

628
00:39:32,015 --> 00:39:33,998
Yeah.

629
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,135
Yeah, but for now,
just the one.

630
00:39:40,439 --> 00:39:43,591
Were you ever
going to tell me?

631
00:39:46,628 --> 00:39:50,448
No.

632
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:05,796
Tommy, I just saw it
all on the news.

633
00:40:05,798 --> 00:40:07,582
I'll be there
as soon as I can.

634
00:40:07,584 --> 00:40:09,550
Bye.

635
00:40:16,058 --> 00:40:18,743
Hello, Laurel.

636
00:40:18,745 --> 00:40:21,779
Mom?

637
00:40:23,098 --> 00:40:25,816
What are you doing here?

638
00:40:25,818 --> 00:40:29,186
I need
to talk to you.

639
00:40:29,188 --> 00:40:31,656
About what?

640
00:40:31,658 --> 00:40:35,409
I know
I've made mistakes.

641
00:40:35,411 --> 00:40:37,161
Yeah.

642
00:40:37,163 --> 00:40:39,630
Yes, you have.

643
00:40:41,784 --> 00:40:43,818
Look, I have to go.

644
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:46,921
Why don't you send me an email
or a postcard some time?

645
00:40:46,923 --> 00:40:49,156
I have something important
I need to discuss with you.

646
00:40:50,743 --> 00:40:54,262
What could be so important
after all this time?

647
00:40:56,214 --> 00:40:58,049
It's about Sarah.

648
00:40:58,051 --> 00:41:00,351
What about her?

649
00:41:00,353 --> 00:41:02,639
I think
she may be alive.

650
00:41:02,739 --> 00:41:07,739
