[girl 2] Alma?

00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,800
Hey, girl!

323
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,000
It's Berta!

324
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,960
- Oh, shit.
- Is something wrong?

325
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,480
No. Berta!

326
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,960
I'm sorry. That little girl
reminded me of, uh...

327
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,880
Oh, yeah! Boo, from Monsters Inc.!

328
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,560
Ah. Yeah.

329
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,520
Remember how we watched it
at one of my birthday parties?

330
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,240
Anyway, never mind.
How's everything with you?

331
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,480
Fine. I mean, same old.

332
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,080
Your eyes look like you've been crying,
they're really red.

333
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,960
No, no, no. No, I feel fine.

334
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,520
How are you? It's been, like, ages, right?

335
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,560
Yeah, I've been spending
most of my time downtown.

336
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,560
[Alma] Mmm.

337
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,480
Yeah, I mean art school is just...
it's just really amazing.

338
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,840
I don't know, just like being surrounded
with artists, I mean it...

339
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,920
- It makes my inner-creativity just thrive.
- Mm.

340
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,080
Do you like this?

341
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,256
- I made it myself.
- Yeah, it's pretty.

342
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,680
At a workshop at school. We're working
with brass lately, so I did this.

343
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,240
And with silver as well.

344
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,880
I can make you one if you'd like.

345
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,880
- No.
- Wait. You could just have this one!

346
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,776
- Oh, no. You really don't have to.
- I insist.

347
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,360
It'd make my day if you took it.

348
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,960
I mean it.

349
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,120
I know that I'm biased
and shouldn't say this,

350
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,480
because I made it,
but it's absolutely gorgeous.

351
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,800
Hm. Yeah.

352
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,840
Hello, Alma. Long time no see.

353
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,120
[Alma] Oh, hey.

354
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,680
Sweetie, it's time to go now.

355
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,160
Well, you know what? My mom's right,
it's been forever since we hung out.

356
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,640
- Mmm.
- I think we should fix that.

357
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,600
- Hey, I'm gonna call you.
- Mm-hmm.

358
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,400
Smile, okay? It's hard
to see you like this.

359
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,160
- Alma, we'll see you.
- [Alma] Bye!

360
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,560
We really need to talk.

361
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Holy shit!

362
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,880
Was that Berta?

363
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,360
She's unrecognizable.

364
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,200
She wants to talk to me.

365
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,280
Why?

366
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,400
[Nata] I can't take it anymore. I mean,
we're arguing, he keeps yelling at me.

367
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,160
It's just that, I don't know, we used
to have these very intimate moments.

368
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,080
But for months now,

369
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,640
it's like we've been moving around
in this fucking cab service. It sucks.

370
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,960
We don't even have sex anymore.

371
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,280
We really need to talk. [voice echoes]

[tense music plays]

373
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,680
[woman] Alma, are you all right?

374
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,400
Yeah, just a bit tired.

375
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,120
[woman] I understand.

376
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,680
I know it's difficult. But to open a case,
I need you to talk to me.

377
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,320

<i>- Time's up.</i>

381
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,120
Okay!

382
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,800
Macaroni is my favorite food.

383
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,200
[Alma chuckles] Mine too.

384
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,080
How did your exam go the other day?

385
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Fine.

386
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,441
You gotta improve your grades
or you'll have trouble passing the year.

387
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,280
You keep repeating that.
But I've never failed, huh?

388
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,120
- How late were you up last night?
- I don't know.

389
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,840
I know you were still up well past 3:00.
I heard you on the phone.

Greta called me,
it wasn't that late.

391
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,200
You didn't get up until twelve o'clock.

392
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,120
- It's Saturday, Dad, come on.
- So?

393
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,360
Maybe you could've studied,
even just for a little bit.

394
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,840
Fine. I will, Dad, okay?
Really. I promise you.

395
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,400
I'll pass everything in June.

396
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,280
- It's really good, Mom.
- Passing isn't good enough.

397
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,480
Gotta make a much bigger effort
if you want a better grade point average.

398
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,680
We've talked about how important
this moment is for your future.

399
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,776
- Thought about what you want to do?
- I don't know.

400
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,560
- Eat your food.
- It's January. What are you waiting for?

401
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,920
Waiting for June to come?

402
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,040
- What are we gonna do then?
- I don't know, Dad!

403
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,680
Trust me, I'd love to know.

404
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,000
It'd make things so much easier,
but I don't know!

405
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,160
I'm sorry!

406
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,760
Pester me all you want,
but nothing will change that, 'kay?

407
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,560
I don't want to eat with you guys anymore.

No. Mom, seriously. I'm 17 years old.

414

It's embarrassing to ask
for permission for a sleep-over, come on.

Alma.

Your mother's the G.O.A.T.

421
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,096
Well, you can have her then.
Because I cannot freaking stand her.

422

You're a moron.

423
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,880
No, dude. I swear, she always
sides with my father every time,

424
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,360
even if he's obviously not right.

425

Honestly, at times I just wanna...
just punch her.

Where in the holy hell did you get that?

442
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,480
- From a shoebox under my mother's bed.
- I can't even.

443
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,736
- It's your mother's?
- Sure is.

444

She'll have you committed.

I don't think she knows she still has it.

gave it to her.

One of the three languages of Sri Lanka.

on the make-up tests aren't good.</i>

She failed six quizzes
in the second grading period.

It'll be hard for her to pass the year.

And even if she did, we don't think
she'll be admitted to uni.

The crisis has affected children
more than we imagined.

And a difficult financial situation
can take a toll on them.

to be the world's best student,

her grades were fine.

Even if just to bicker,
at least she... she participated.
