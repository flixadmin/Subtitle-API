1
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,440
He could still be alive.

2
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:24,613
No.

3
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:27,646
Move out of the way.

4
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,235
She died because of you.

5
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,949
If only I'd gone out sooner...

6
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:15,779
This is your fault.

7
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:21,213
You killed her.

8
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,454
ORIGINAL STORY SWEET HOME
BY CARNBY KIM AND YOUNGCHAN HWANG

9
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:28,903
You can't trust that announcement.

10
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,105
Will you really be okay?

11
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:36,824
We can't keep sponging off you.
We should do something.

12
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,326
Thank you for the meals and this.

13
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:41,579
May God bless you.

14
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,708
I'm Buddhist.

15
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:50,418
If the first floor is safe,
we'll come back to get you.

16
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,801
Don't make a promise you can't keep.

17
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,383
I feel like

18
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,891
I should say farewell now.

19
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,478
Someone once said that
even the thickest darkness

20
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,152
disappears with the faintest light.

21
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,605
Is the person who said that still alive?

22
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:17,781
I'm not sure.

23
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:19,865
I...

24
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,331
Can I go with you?

25
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,504
I guess three is better than two. Right?

26
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,539
Of course.

27
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,549
Okay.

28
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:33,629
Go.

29
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,552
Go. All of you.

30
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,515
Hyun-su, you have to come back, okay?

31
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:53,935
Okay.

32
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,895
Thank you for saving us.

33
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:01,986
Shall we get going?

34
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,200
Thank you.

35
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:35,936
Suddenly,

36
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,204
I'm like the head of a kindergarten.

37
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,450
AUGUST 18, 2020
DAY 4 OF CONFINEMENT

38
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,917
I'VE NEVER BEEN THIS GLAD TO HEAR
THE APARTMENT PA ANNOUNCEMENT

39
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,669
I WANTED TO GO AS SOON AS I HEARD HIM

40
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,710
URGE US TO GO DOWN TO THE FIRST FLOOR

41
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,626
I THINK WE SHOULD GO DOWN
FOR YU-RI'S SAKE

42
00:04:58,715 --> 00:04:59,965
I think it's time to leave.

43
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,299
Not yet, sir.

44
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,759
I'm praying hard for you
to live a long life.

45
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,597
No, I didn't mean this world.

46
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,772
I meant here. This disgustingly small,

47
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,652
dirty old room.

48
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,976
But isn't this place
younger than you, sir?

49
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:17,944
How long have you been living here?

50
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,111
Let me see.

51
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:21,989
Hold on.

52
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,041
Was it since the independence

53
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,080
or the Korean War?

54
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,590
Your life has been extended just now.

55
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,260
I guess I won't die anytime soon
thanks to you.

56
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,522
What are you doing?

57
00:05:57,065 --> 00:06:00,065
Didn't you hear the announcement?
I should go to the first floor to help.

58
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,532
Could you be of any help?

59
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,035
Careful.

60
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,965
She must be devastated.

61
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,806
If my Bom died,

62
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,225
I think I'd be devastated, too.

63
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,989
I think this is a little different.

64
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:44,904
No, it's not.

65
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,446
Bom is family to me.

66
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,241
Still,

67
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:54,495
it can't be the same
as losing your own child.

68
00:06:55,623 --> 00:06:57,423
You don't have kids, either.

69
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,379
You wouldn't know what it's like.

70
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:06,384
- Right.
- Anyway, I feel really bad

71
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:09,847
for Ms. Cha and the firefighter lady.

72
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:11,973
What about her?

73
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,307
Her fiancé used to live here.

74
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,305
He died.

75
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,978
The wedding's supposed to be in two days.

76
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,074
What happened to him?

77
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,493
I don't know.

78
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,451
What do you think happened?

79
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,869
She seemed so poised. I had no idea.

80
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,420
But what's taking her so long?

81
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,842
Do you think something happened to her?

82
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,961
SANG-WON

83
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,843
Sang-won.

84
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:35,987
The cellphone's out of service anyway.

85
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,280
Exactly.

86
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:40,775
But how'd she know her daughter
was coming?

87
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,196
It's a mystery.

88
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,619
Do you think she's possessed?

89
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,834
Possessed? No, she's just crazy.

90
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,749
I feel bad for her.

91
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,298
Anyway,
you better watch out for Eun-hyeok.

92
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,469
That guy is totally heartless.

93
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,589
That's bullshit. He saved your life.

94
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:00,717
What are you talking about?

95
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,845
If he hadn't stopped you,

96
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,520
you'd be dead like that soldier.

97
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:06,934
Hey, Seok-hyeon.

98
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:10,017
It's so reassuring
to have you as the leader.

99
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,774
Leader, my ass. I don't want that job.

100
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,857
But we can't let that four-eyes
be the leader.

101
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,361
I'm glad you're okay.

102
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,570
You knew

103
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,284
there was a monster, didn't you?

104
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:11,254
Yi-kyung.

105
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,086
I was worried about you.

106
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,173
Are you okay?

107
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,029
This is not a drill.

108
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:42,067
This is not a drill.

109
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,534
BREAKING NEWS

110
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:47,368
As of 24:00 on August 17, 2020,
martial law has been declared

111
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:51,211
throughout the Republic of Korea
in accordance with Article 77, Section 1

112
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,918
of the Constitution and Article 2,
Section 2 of the Martial Law Act.

113
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:58,209
The military will be in charge
of all security and civil affairs.

114
00:13:58,295 --> 00:14:01,045
The military has confirmed that
an unspecified number of people

115
00:14:01,131 --> 00:14:03,301
have been turning into unknown creatures.

116
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,094
The exact cause is still unknown,

117
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,717
but it is believed
to be related to human desire.

118
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,885
It is not a respiratory
or blood-borne infection.

119
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,636
Quarantine those who show symptoms
of hypothermia,

120
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:15,806
nosebleeds, fainting, and auditory
or visual hallucinations.

121
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:19,782
These creatures have excellent
resilience and regenerative abilities.

122
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,239
Before an individual turns,
there is a period of time

123
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:24,699
when they cannot recover
from severe lacerations or damage.

124
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,080
It is the only time
these creatures can be killed.

125
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:30,788
We have thus termed this
the "golden hour."

126
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:35,708
All captured creatures

127
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,041
should be incinerated.

128
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:42,128
Currently, this is the only action
civilians can take.

129
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:51,468
The military can and will
solve the current situation.

130
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,347
Survive.

131
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,894
Good luck.

132
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,809
See? We're fine.

133
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,570
The military will come and rescue us
if we hold out.

134
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,820
I knew it.

135
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,992
She just told us to survive on our own.

136
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,110
Is that what she meant?

137
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:07,986
Desire makes you a monster?

138
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,203
- Does that make sense?
- You saw them roaming outside.

139
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,577
She told us to survive.

140
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:14,751
- That's what she meant, right?
- What?

141
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:16,290
That's it!

142
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,583
- But the president died.
- Is that really what she meant?

143
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:20,667
- Yes, of course.
- What do you mean by hold out?

144
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,173
- What?
- Do you really believe that?

145
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,054
- We all saw it.
- Pay back what you owe!

146
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,057
Seriously?

147
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,903
Is it okay to go downstairs like this?

148
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,608
Shouldn't we grab something useful?

149
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,324
The most useful thing is our lives.

150
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:58,831
It's a person.

151
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,250
I'm relieved to see a corpse.

152
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:09,799
It's still warm.

153
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,545
He hasn't been dead for long.

154
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:13,848
Oh, God.

155
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,201
Put it back if you don't want it.

156
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:36,201
- You're mean.
- Yes, I am.

157
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,416
I can do worse things to survive.

158
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,552
You're an accomplice now.

159
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,143
Let's go.

160
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,677
Don't die. Why did you die?

161
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,349
You can't leave me here all alone.

162
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:40,599
Don't die, please. I beg you.

163
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:48,396
MOON HYEON-SUK, CHA SU-A

164
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,364
- Is he dead?
- No.

165
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,400
He isn't dead.

166
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,869
I thought he'd die.

167
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:59,203
- Do you know him?
- No.

168
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,996
Don't go near him.

169
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,870
- We can't leave the infected here.
- Take this monster out.

170
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:10,589
Dad...

171
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:14,428
You really fell.

172
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:22,886
When I told you not to die here,
I meant the whole building.

173
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,269
Where am I?

174
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,397
It's a place where everyone gathered,
waiting to die.

175
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,027
What about the other two?

176
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:36,659
They're safe.

177
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,789
I guess you aren't as shitty as I thought.

178
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,791
You should worry about yourself, not them.

179
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,711
Pardon?

180
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,341
Eun-yu.

181
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,257
You're fine.

182
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,178
You fell from the 9th floor
and woke up in 3 hours.

183
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,563
Maybe the golden hour saved you.

184
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,766
Isn't it ironic?

185
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,395
The golden hour used to mean
the last hour to save someone.

186
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:14,034
Now it means the only possible period
of time to destroy someone.

187
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:19,575
How do you feel?

188
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,245
I think I'm okay.

189
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:30,785
Good.

190
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,673
It's going to be tough from here on out.

191
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,184
What is it?

192
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,969
Why did he call us?

193
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:41,052
- What?
- Keep going.

194
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,676
You're out of your mind.

195
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,311
You brought a frigging monster in here.

196
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,190
Don't you dare turn.

197
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,395
Got it? You fucking monster.

198
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:03,406
Answer when an adult speaks to you.

199
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:06,793
Got it.

200
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,417
- What?
- We can't do that.

201
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,670
I don't intend on missing the golden hour.

202
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,843
- The Lord said...
- I'm sure Jesus never lived

203
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,922
in a world like this, did He?

204
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,087
It's for everyone's safety.

205
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:20,683
Here.

206
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:22,799
What is that?

207
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,643
Each of you take a piece of paper.

208
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:29,733
If you think we should oust Hyun-su,
draw a circle.

209
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:33,267
And if you don't think we should,
draw an X.

210
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,977
Then put the paper in this box.

211
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,147
Obviously, he'll be kicked out.
Why bother?

212
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,446
Just do a show of hands. I want him out.

213
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:41,990
Who wants him out?

214
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,736
Why don't you raise your hand?

215
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:48,706
I don't.

216
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,541
You aren't old enough to vote.

217
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,463
Are we electing the president?

218
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,382
Age doesn't matter.

219
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,173
How dare you talk back?

220
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,837
When an adult says something,
you should shut up and agree.

221
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:05,349
FUCK BASTARDS LIKE YOU

222
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:08,516
Did you just swear at me?

223
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,981
I'm old enough to be your dad.
How dare you!

224
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:13,396
No, I didn't.

225
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,773
I said you're the best.

226
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,398
FUCK BASTARDS LIKE YOU

227
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:25,407
To protect everyone's privacy,
it must be a secret ballot.

228
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,372
What?

229
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,334
Because ousting him...

230
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,575
would be taking part in murder.

231
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,715
Privacy? My ass.

232
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,556
I want him out. Out!

233
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:51,772
Murder?

234
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,563
We're making this decision to survive.

235
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,017
Don't be scared!

236
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,694
Hey, aren't you going to raise your hand?

237
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,197
What? Well...

238
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:04,279
Raise your hand, you stupid cow.

239
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,658
I think Eun-hyeok has a point.

240
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:11,117
Isn't it better not to know
who agreed to oust him?

241
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,503
It's only natural to vote
in a democratic country.

242
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,627
Democracy? The world is coming to an end.

243
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:20,551
Stop calling your wife names

244
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,010
and using profanities.

245
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,301
It's very offensive.

246
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,182
Why you...

247
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:29,432
- How dare you tell me what...
- Enough.

248
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:19,688
IN FAVOR, 8

249
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,693
OPPOSED, 7

250
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:25,648
There are eight in favor
and seven opposed.

251
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:32,080
If one of the last two ballots is
in favor, he'll be ousted.

252
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:35,084
Seven people opposed?

253
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:36,543
Are you guys crazy?

254
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:38,287
Opposed.

255
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:39,674
It's eight to eight.

256
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:42,961
Damn it.

257
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:44,585
Did you oppose?

258
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,215
I didn't.

259
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:51,184
All the bitches and bastards on his side

260
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,353
should all be thrown out!

261
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,641
Hey, mister!

262
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:55,733
Don't get worked up yet.

263
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,268
This last vote will determine the result.

264
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:17,910
Invalid.

265
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,464
No way.

266
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:30,144
Hey, bring that bastard here.

267
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,338
Me?

268
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,678
Yes! We have to get rid of him
as fast as we can!

269
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,349
Voting, my ass.

270
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:40,983
Are you all nuts?

271
00:24:41,897 --> 00:24:43,817
Did you already forget that someone died?

272
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,149
Are you against the result?

273
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:49,453
What? "Taking part in murder?"

274
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,949
Murder is killing a human being,

275
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,038
not a monster!

276
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,172
Honey.

277
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:06,795
Honey...

278
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,590
This is...

279
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,098
It's because I'm tired.

280
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,850
- Don't come near us!
- Don't!

281
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:18,392
It's because I'm tired!

282
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,403
You better brace yourself.

283
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,108
What?

284
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:29,738
If you don't want to be eaten
by a monster.

285
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,739
You son of a bitch.

286
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,710
Do I have the right to vote?

287
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:49,376
If I put this in,
he'll be thrown out with me, right?

288
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,093
Am I right?

289
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,477
He looks like he's just a kid.

290
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,567
A handsome kid.

291
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:12,823
Didn't you see how much he bled
and still didn't die?

292
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,823
You can't judge someone on their looks.

293
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,827
Would he survive a shot to the head?

294
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,330
How can we kill him then?

295
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,041
- Can we?
- How can you...

296
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:24,373
Did you vote in favor?

297
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,165
You're the murder accomplices.

298
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,962
What if he turns into a monster?

299
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,205
Will you leave him like that?

300
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,052
Can someone explain

301
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:34,877
why this is happening?

302
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,260
Is it because of a virus?

303
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,636
It's because of radiation.

304
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,603
Come on. Didn't you guys watch the news?

305
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,643
It's because of human desire.

306
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:47,517
Right. It must be because the owner
of the supermarket is so greedy.

307
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,066
Then what about Hyun-su?

308
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:50,728
What was his desire?

309
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:53,108
You better be careful, too.

310
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,068
It seemed your appetite
was out of control.

311
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:00,584
- It's because of radiation.
- Radiation?

312
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,700
We're getting punished.

313
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,826
It's God's punishment.

314
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:09,166
Yes. I agree.

315
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:12,052
That's the most plausible answer
I've heard so far.

316
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,295
Since we're all humans,

317
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:18,136
no one knows...

318
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:25,725
who will be next.

319
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,329
What?

320
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,207
Why am I...

321
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:51,129
You had a nosebleed and fainted.

322
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,376
I think it's pretty obvious.

323
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:01,181
That can't be...

324
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:04,099
Why now?

325
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:05,888
Why?

326
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:16,704
Well...

327
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,315
I hear you're holding out.

328
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:23,575
How are you doing it?

329
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:25,412
How?

330
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,830
You're shameless.

331
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:35,667
I have to live. I want to live.

332
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,465
Pull yourself together.

333
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:42,548
What?

334
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,723
I have nothing else to tell you.

335
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:01,949
It's a good thing. Don't you think?

336
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,079
He beat you every day.

337
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,367
What? Did I say something wrong?

338
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,623
Divorcees are considered hot these days.

339
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:10,365
A new life lies before you.

340
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:22,302
Excuse me.

341
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,717
I can't find Su-ung anywhere.

342
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:29,766
Oh, my... I guess you haven't heard.

343
00:29:30,643 --> 00:29:32,063
Ms. Cha's daughter

344
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,726
really came back.

345
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:40,362
And Su-ung went out to rescue her.

346
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,198
He barely took a few steps.

347
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,067
Whoosh! It got him.

348
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,922
We're stuck here.

349
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:01,839
GREEN HOME HAIR SALON

350
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:09,306
SANG-WON

351
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,730
Sang-won...

352
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,700
Here.

353
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,825
You must be starving.

354
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:35,752
Thank you.

355
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:39,003
Eat this and cheer up.

356
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,808
I'm sorry I stared.

357
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:54,730
Eat up.

358
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:08,533
What's wrong?

359
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:10,536
Is something wrong with it?

360
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,500
It tastes okay.

361
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:20,001
My stomach is a little upset.

362
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:02,802
She's very pretty.

363
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:10,184
Did you take many pictures of her?

364
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,385
I only took a few.

365
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,100
That's what I regret.

366
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,151
He was a good person.

367
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,238
You need energy to miss someone.

368
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,657
Is this funny to you?

369
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:18,833
You should quit music
and become a comedian.

370
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,285
Why don't you teach me then?

371
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:24,793
First, relax your body.

372
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,166
Spread your legs shoulder-width apart.

373
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,838
Keep your hands close.

374
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,101
Don't take your eyes off the ball.

375
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,824
It's disgusting to see you act nice.

376
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:59,408
Do you think a frigging chocolate bar
can cheer her up?

377
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:05,249
You did that to make yourself feel better.

378
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,462
Are you the crazy bitch around here?

379
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,630
Fine. Go head, you crazy bitch.

380
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:30,902
He doesn't die?

381
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:47,292
You're here?

382
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,919
You said see you again, son of a bitch!

383
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:04,889
Wait a minute.

384
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,437
I have something to say.

385
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,404
I...

386
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:44,104
I think I've turned into a monster.

387
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:53,531
Please lock me up.

388
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,284
When did you get here?

389
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:03,947
Did you see the news?

390
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:06,115
It's not infectious.

391
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,956
We're still fucked, though,

392
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,457
because the world is doomed.

393
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,257
Moron.

394
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,642
He really looks like he got beat up.

395
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,353
He's the one who wants to be locked up.

396
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,983
Why did it happen to such a good man?

397
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:30,309
If you feel that bad,
you can get in there with him.

398
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:35,900
That's not the reason, is it?

399
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:40,492
Jeez.

400
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,005
Good morning.

401
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:48,893
You must be hungry.

402
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:53,555
I'm good.

403
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:58,568
What?

404
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,742
A monster can't eat?

405
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,989
You sleep well, though.

406
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,461
What does it feel like?

407
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:20,671
You feel so powerful, don't you?

408
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:35,102
How can I become like that?

409
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:38,900
Tell me.

410
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:42,992
Tell me.

411
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:48,201
I can do it really well.

412
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,703
What should I do?

413
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,278
Here.

414
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:24,454
You can take it.

415
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:31,953
PREGNANCY TEST

416
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,962
It's okay.

417
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,419
You never know.

418
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:38,583
Just in case.

419
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,211
Okay?

420
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:47,341
PREGNANCY TEST

421
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,315
Amen.

422
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:17,583
It was your voice, wasn't it?

423
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:21,089
"The first floor is quite safe for now."

424
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:22,799
Yes.

425
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,213
Did I hear you wrong?

426
00:40:30,928 --> 00:40:31,968
That shield.

427
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:39,691
Who made it?

428
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,832
Mister.

429
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:57,794
What?

430
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,332
Ms. Im...

431
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:04,092
still hasn't come out of the bathroom.

432
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:08,626
Do you need to poop?

433
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:11,886
How long has she been in there?

434
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,846
It's been about an hour.

435
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:27,654
Okay. Step aside for a bit.

436
