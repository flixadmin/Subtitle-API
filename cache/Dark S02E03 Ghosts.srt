1
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:12,590
I've seen you grow up.

2
00:00:17,422 --> 00:00:19,232
Become a man.

3
00:00:20,984 --> 00:00:23,404
The whole cycle of your life.

4
00:00:24,172 --> 00:00:26,212
Time chose you.

5
00:00:29,005 --> 00:00:30,845
God chose you.

6
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,880
Don't forget that we
are your home now, too.

7
00:00:42,905 --> 00:00:45,185
No harm will come to you.

8
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:47,815
We're watching over you.

9
00:00:50,922 --> 00:00:53,122
Time is always with you.

10
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,870
Wherever you go.

11
00:00:56,838 --> 00:00:58,568
You carry it within.

12
00:00:59,422 --> 00:01:01,232
And it carries you.

13
00:01:05,422 --> 00:01:08,052
It sees and hears everything

14
00:01:08,797 --> 00:01:11,127
that you do and say.

15
00:01:11,922 --> 00:01:13,172
Tick,

16
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,340
tock.

17
00:01:15,422 --> 00:01:17,212
Tick, tock.

18
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:35,632
Claudia. You haven't left?

19
00:03:35,713 --> 00:03:38,083
I... I forgot the milk money.

20
00:03:39,463 --> 00:03:41,953
- If that's all right I'll...
- Wait.

21
00:03:47,797 --> 00:03:49,887
Buy yourself a sweet, too.

22
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,380
Thank you.

23
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:00,915
Oh, God.

24
00:04:02,672 --> 00:04:04,712
Maybe she didn't notice?

25
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,460
Don't worry about it. Every
family hides something.

26
00:04:18,547 --> 00:04:20,207
Where are you going?

27
00:04:20,297 --> 00:04:21,977
Nowhere special.

28
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,010
I just have a few things to do.

29
00:04:40,422 --> 00:04:42,122
You're beautiful.

30
00:05:04,406 --> 00:05:06,916
23 June 1954

31
00:05:06,955 --> 00:05:10,185
4 days until the Apocalypse

32
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,460
Helge?

33
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,510
"And when we know that he
hears us, whatever we ask,

34
00:05:57,535 --> 00:06:00,385
we know that we will receive
what we asked of him."

35
00:06:00,422 --> 00:06:03,882
Nothing is lost from his sight.
He returns everything.

36
00:06:10,505 --> 00:06:12,359
7 months later and

37
00:06:12,384 --> 00:06:15,609
we have no clue who this monster is.

38
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,840
Why hasn't he revealed

39
00:06:19,047 --> 00:06:21,327
his identity by this point?

40
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,260
Why has no one come looking for him?

41
00:06:30,338 --> 00:06:33,428
Makes you wonder
how some people live.

42
00:06:33,922 --> 00:06:35,812
Almost like ghosts.

43
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,010
Egon?

44
00:06:46,547 --> 00:06:48,817
Can I ask you a question?

45
00:06:53,797 --> 00:06:55,827
Your wife and you,

46
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,115
are things still...

47
00:06:59,297 --> 00:07:01,047
I mean, do you still...

48
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,400
Often?

49
00:07:04,297 --> 00:07:05,897
No, at all.

50
00:07:07,213 --> 00:07:08,733
Oh, my.

51
00:07:10,213 --> 00:07:13,443
You're pretty old-fashioned
for such a big boy.

52
00:07:19,047 --> 00:07:20,647
Listen, Egon.

53
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:29,630
You've got to let off some steam, hm?

54
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:33,560
Marriage isn't really
the way they say it is.

55
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:38,380
You have kids and you
become different people.

56
00:07:38,963 --> 00:07:41,733
It's like she's married to the brats.

57
00:07:42,297 --> 00:07:44,707
That's the way nature intended it.

58
00:07:45,005 --> 00:07:46,685
But, out there,

59
00:07:47,255 --> 00:07:50,085
there are still plenty of
tender buds to be plucked.

60
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,960
- The boy, they found him!
- They found who?

61
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:58,940
The Doppler kid. Helge Doppler.

62
00:07:59,624 --> 00:08:02,294
- Did they find his body?
- No, the kid's fine.

63
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,212
He just walked in through the
front door as if nothing had happened.

64
00:08:10,338 --> 00:08:12,338
Do you like your mother?

65
00:08:12,422 --> 00:08:14,341
My mother's strange sometimes.

66
00:08:14,366 --> 00:08:16,876
She acts like I don't
understand anything.

67
00:08:17,672 --> 00:08:20,172
When I have kids I'll be different.

68
00:08:23,047 --> 00:08:26,417
Why don't you talk about what
it was like where you're from?

69
00:08:26,505 --> 00:08:28,785
Before you moved to Winden.

70
00:08:29,713 --> 00:08:31,993
My mum was sad all the time.

71
00:08:32,213 --> 00:08:34,253
I lived in a home.

72
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:38,457
She doesn't like talking
about it, so I don't either.

73
00:08:38,547 --> 00:08:41,047
Do you have any family
other than your mother?

74
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:43,805
My mum has a brother.

75
00:08:44,172 --> 00:08:46,652
But I think they hate each other.

76
00:08:46,672 --> 00:08:49,152
Do you think she's happy here?

77
00:09:00,922 --> 00:09:02,752
How about now?

78
00:09:35,713 --> 00:09:38,363
Where the hell is The Ghosts?

79
00:09:40,463 --> 00:09:42,633
- Have you seen my book around?
- Which book?

80
00:09:42,713 --> 00:09:44,133
The Ghosts!

81
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:49,540
You don't have to stare at
me like that. I know I'm late.

82
00:09:52,713 --> 00:09:55,543
- Did you leave it here?
- No, I uh...

83
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,360
I mean, I thought...

84
00:10:00,047 --> 00:10:03,457
maybe you can skip school today
and we can go do something nice.

85
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:08,150
I was thinking we haven't done
anything together in quite some time.

86
00:10:09,255 --> 00:10:12,725
I have a history test, and later
I was going to go for a swim.

87
00:10:14,588 --> 00:10:16,248
Okay, another time.

88
00:10:18,755 --> 00:10:20,165
Regina, wait!

89
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,550
I like the way you wear your hair now.

90
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:42,232
It makes you look... so adult.

91
00:10:46,797 --> 00:10:48,047
Thank you.

92
00:10:51,088 --> 00:10:53,838
I'm out of time. I have to go.

93
00:11:09,088 --> 00:11:10,458
Time...

94
00:11:23,255 --> 00:11:24,955
A JOURNEY THROUGH TIME

95
00:11:29,172 --> 00:11:31,042
<i>For Claudia from Helge</i>

96
00:11:45,463 --> 00:11:48,803
"My only aim is to take many lives.

97
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,840
The more the better I feel."

98
00:12:07,255 --> 00:12:08,928
Good day, Mrs. Doppler.

99
00:12:09,053 --> 00:12:11,529
I spoke with your colleagues at length.

100
00:12:12,713 --> 00:12:15,373
Could I ask Helge a few questions?

101
00:12:15,963 --> 00:12:18,513
Since returning, Helge has not spoken.

102
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,990
I think there's something
wrong with my boy.

103
00:12:28,797 --> 00:12:30,617
It wouldn't take long.

104
00:12:49,755 --> 00:12:51,085
Helge.

105
00:12:53,797 --> 00:12:55,617
Do you remember me?

106
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,960
I'm Claudia's father.

107
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:12,365
Maybe you could tell me
where you were all this time.

108
00:13:13,963 --> 00:13:15,563
And who with?

109
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,750
Who did that to you?

110
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:24,050
The inspector asked you a question.

111
00:13:26,213 --> 00:13:28,483
Just talk, for God's sake!

112
00:13:40,713 --> 00:13:44,163
I just wanted to see how you were doing.

113
00:13:47,088 --> 00:13:49,938
This could sound a little strange,
but...

114
00:13:54,463 --> 00:13:56,513
last year, this book...

115
00:13:58,047 --> 00:14:00,517
- Why was it important I get it?
- I...

116
00:14:01,588 --> 00:14:03,208
I figured

117
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:07,210
you might be the only one
who could understand me.

118
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,800
Time...

119
00:14:14,672 --> 00:14:16,342
is always with you.

120
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:18,132
Wherever you go.

121
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,050
You carry it within, and it carries you.

122
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:26,550
It sees and hears everything you do,

123
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,210
and say.

124
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,200
I don't understand.

125
00:14:31,713 --> 00:14:33,333
He said...

126
00:14:35,047 --> 00:14:39,157
it's a struggle between good
and evil, between light and dark.

127
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,830
And that the travellers could
undo everything that occurs.

128
00:14:43,963 --> 00:14:47,463
And if we succeed, none of it happens.

129
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,380
Who said that to you?

130
00:14:50,463 --> 00:14:51,843
Noah.

131
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,380
Who's Noah?

132
00:14:57,922 --> 00:15:01,302
You are never to trust him.
Never! You understand?

133
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,800
Never!

134
00:15:03,963 --> 00:15:05,173
Helge!

135
00:15:08,005 --> 00:15:09,835
I'm sorry.

136
00:15:10,963 --> 00:15:12,963
I never wanted all this.

137
00:15:17,005 --> 00:15:18,205
Tick,

138
00:15:19,172 --> 00:15:20,382
tock.

139
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,378
Tick,

140
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,463
tock.

141
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,960
Did anyone see you?

142
00:16:26,172 --> 00:16:28,612
They sent Helge to return today.

143
00:16:30,588 --> 00:16:32,628
Noah's also returned.

144
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:35,430
I'm not afraid of him.

145
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:40,090
- You carry the same blood.
- You can't choose your family.

146
00:16:40,172 --> 00:16:42,462
Denying your blood
means true freedom.

147
00:16:42,547 --> 00:16:44,357
You said so yourself.

148
00:16:45,755 --> 00:16:49,085
Yes, but our entire lives
are defined by our family.

149
00:16:50,213 --> 00:16:51,763
Sic mundus...

150
00:16:53,422 --> 00:16:55,912
They are preparing the next cycle.

151
00:16:57,047 --> 00:16:58,527
In 4 days.

152
00:16:59,672 --> 00:17:02,122
Your brother is a blind fool.

153
00:17:03,047 --> 00:17:05,510
All the suffering he causes people...

154
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,821
but it will come to an end.

155
00:17:10,838 --> 00:17:12,858
You must give me this.

156
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,090
Not yet. There is still time.

157
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:28,912
Today?

158
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:37,598
I wanted to thank you.

159
00:17:38,255 --> 00:17:39,665
For everything.

160
00:17:45,255 --> 00:17:48,065
My mother loves you. Did you know?

161
00:17:48,755 --> 00:17:51,805
She will make you very
happy if you let her.

162
00:18:36,797 --> 00:18:39,377
Are you... H.G. Tannhaus?

163
00:18:42,713 --> 00:18:44,593
Heterochromia.

164
00:18:45,672 --> 00:18:47,422
One blue eye

165
00:18:48,797 --> 00:18:50,687
and one brown one.

166
00:18:56,047 --> 00:18:58,167
Did you write this book?

167
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:02,542
I wondered when this day would arrive.

168
00:19:05,088 --> 00:19:07,308
When we would meet again.

169
00:19:08,172 --> 00:19:10,262
I don't even know you.

170
00:19:10,672 --> 00:19:12,512
But I know you.

171
00:19:15,255 --> 00:19:17,325
It's an endless cycle.

172
00:19:23,838 --> 00:19:25,448
Peculiar.

173
00:19:26,463 --> 00:19:28,343
And he didn't speak?

174
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:32,340
What do you make of all this?

175
00:19:32,797 --> 00:19:35,377
He just turns up out of nowhere?

176
00:19:35,838 --> 00:19:37,468
I wonder

177
00:19:37,755 --> 00:19:40,255
if the two things aren't connected.

178
00:19:43,172 --> 00:19:46,632
The killings of those
children and the Doppler boy.

179
00:19:46,713 --> 00:19:48,983
How could he have done it?

180
00:19:49,505 --> 00:19:52,145
He's been locked up for half a year.

181
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,420
He didn't act alone.

182
00:19:56,213 --> 00:19:58,484
You think an accomplice?

183
00:19:58,909 --> 00:20:01,347
Let's question the psycho once more.

184
00:20:02,797 --> 00:20:04,687
Maybe he'll talk now.

185
00:20:08,213 --> 00:20:09,923
An accomplice...

186
00:20:10,005 --> 00:20:11,165
Yeah.

187
00:20:19,255 --> 00:20:22,055
CLOSED PSYCHIATRIC
WARD 3

188
00:20:31,172 --> 00:20:33,792
I want to know what all of this means.

189
00:20:38,422 --> 00:20:40,052
Those lyrics.

190
00:20:40,963 --> 00:20:44,673
You said these exact
words to me in 1953.

191
00:20:45,338 --> 00:20:47,178
But this record

192
00:20:47,588 --> 00:20:50,258
was only released last year.

193
00:20:58,338 --> 00:21:00,148
And you said

194
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,900
you had a son yourself.

195
00:21:04,922 --> 00:21:07,732
Why were those the
children you murdered?

196
00:21:09,838 --> 00:21:11,918
I didn't kill the children.

197
00:21:14,047 --> 00:21:16,137
I wanted to save them.

198
00:21:24,755 --> 00:21:27,245
You said before I was dying.

199
00:21:28,547 --> 00:21:31,057
How in the world did
you know I had cancer?

200
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,690
The white devil.

201
00:21:46,797 --> 00:21:49,087
Do you know who that is?

202
00:21:51,005 --> 00:21:53,205
You're as deranged as I am.

203
00:21:59,672 --> 00:22:03,272
But why did you never
tell us who you are?

204
00:22:04,172 --> 00:22:05,602
Who are you?

205
00:22:10,213 --> 00:22:11,513
Ulrich.

206
00:22:12,463 --> 00:22:14,013
Ulrich Nielsen.

207
00:22:17,297 --> 00:22:19,557
And I come from the future.

208
00:22:21,672 --> 00:22:25,172
I am what you might call a fraud.

209
00:22:29,797 --> 00:22:33,257
Have you ever heard the
term "bootstrap paradox"?

210
00:22:34,338 --> 00:22:35,458
No.

211
00:22:36,047 --> 00:22:38,707
Well, in a bootstrap paradox

212
00:22:39,463 --> 00:22:41,093
an artefact,

213
00:22:41,597 --> 00:22:43,337
or any information,

214
00:22:43,422 --> 00:22:47,132
is sent back to the past
from the future.

215
00:22:47,713 --> 00:22:52,513
And this, in turn,
creates an infinite cycle

216
00:22:52,588 --> 00:22:57,088
in which the artefact doesn't
have a real origin anymore.

217
00:22:57,172 --> 00:22:59,002
It exists

218
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,750
without ever having been created.

219
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,170
To put it simply, this book

220
00:23:06,255 --> 00:23:08,685
has travelled back through time.

221
00:23:09,172 --> 00:23:11,962
It found me

222
00:23:12,047 --> 00:23:14,797
before I even wrote it.

223
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:19,040
It's all a question of origin.

224
00:23:19,755 --> 00:23:23,295
Where is the beginning?
When is the beginning?

225
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:25,800
Is there a beginning at all?

226
00:23:28,338 --> 00:23:31,588
The world is full of such paradoxes.

227
00:23:31,672 --> 00:23:35,052
We simply choose to ignore
them most of the time.

228
00:23:36,672 --> 00:23:39,122
Good luck. This one doesn't talk.

229
00:23:39,588 --> 00:23:41,118
To anybody.

230
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,060
I don't think you'll
get anything out of him.

231
00:24:03,463 --> 00:24:04,593
Hello?

232
00:24:08,213 --> 00:24:09,883
My name is Tiedemann.

233
00:24:11,505 --> 00:24:14,115
Egon Tiedemann. Do you remember me?

234
00:24:14,547 --> 00:24:16,577
I arrested you last year.

235
00:24:18,172 --> 00:24:22,052
I... I have a few questions
I'd like to ask you.

236
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:28,157
The Doppler kid is home again.

237
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:35,480
I want to know where Helge was taken.

238
00:24:36,963 --> 00:24:39,073
Do you have an accomplice?

239
00:24:39,547 --> 00:24:41,637
If you would talk now

240
00:24:41,963 --> 00:24:44,503
it could very well help your situation.

241
00:24:47,047 --> 00:24:49,107
It's the medication.

242
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,900
We have to sedate him.

243
00:24:52,338 --> 00:24:54,958
Has he given you his name yet?

244
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,940
Not that I know of.

245
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,130
I am Ulrich Nielsen.

is Ulrich Nielsen."

253
00:25:50,547 --> 00:25:52,547
Don't you want to tell me

254
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:54,930
why you are really here?

255
00:25:55,838 --> 00:25:57,958
You want to know how it all works.

256
00:25:58,547 --> 00:26:00,387
How do you know that?

257
00:26:00,672 --> 00:26:05,132
She told me that you would
eventually turn up here.

258
00:26:05,755 --> 00:26:08,525
And that I should
explain the device to you.

259
00:26:08,713 --> 00:26:11,673
That was... what you said.

260
00:26:12,088 --> 00:26:14,308
Your future self, that is.

261
00:26:14,922 --> 00:26:17,882
The paradox is that
just a short while ago

262
00:26:17,963 --> 00:26:21,513
I wouldn't have been able to
explain any of this to you.

263
00:26:21,588 --> 00:26:23,048
But last year

264
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:25,590
someone explained it
quite clearly to me.

265
00:26:25,672 --> 00:26:27,502
It was another...

266
00:26:27,963 --> 00:26:29,803
time traveller.

267
00:26:30,963 --> 00:26:33,403
I think she knew already.

268
00:26:34,005 --> 00:26:38,295
She knew how everything would happen,

269
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,410
until this very moment.

270
00:26:40,672 --> 00:26:43,382
She knew that you would come here

271
00:26:43,463 --> 00:26:46,523
so I could explain to
you, and therefore her,

272
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,760
how the device works.

273
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:00,360
He seems so strange to me.

274
00:27:00,422 --> 00:27:03,652
He's empty inside,
as if he's just a shell.

275
00:27:06,297 --> 00:27:08,704
I mean, he never was
the brightest child,

276
00:27:08,729 --> 00:27:11,361
but now you would think
he was stupid.

277
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,907
He frightens me.

278
00:27:14,838 --> 00:27:18,708
And with Bernd gone I don't really
know how to handle the situation.

279
00:27:19,797 --> 00:27:22,877
Perhaps he's possessed by the devil.

280
00:27:22,963 --> 00:27:26,883
Please take a look at him and
tell me everything is all right.

281
00:27:28,463 --> 00:27:30,683
And he still hasn't spoken?

282
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:44,262
Helge, come downstairs. There's
someone here to speak with you.

283
00:28:08,463 --> 00:28:10,613
Time is always with you.

284
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:12,660
Wherever you go.

285
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,960
You carry it within you,

286
00:28:15,047 --> 00:28:16,907
and it carries you.

287
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:20,980
It sees and hears
everything you do and say.

288
00:28:25,755 --> 00:28:28,325
Your mother is worried about you.

289
00:28:30,463 --> 00:28:33,273
Shall we show her
there's no reason to be?

290
00:28:38,338 --> 00:28:41,008
I'd like you to read something for me.

291
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,220
Would you do that?

292
00:28:46,713 --> 00:28:48,563
"You are my shield,

293
00:28:49,547 --> 00:28:51,027
my protection.

294
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,920
I hope for your word."

295
00:28:58,672 --> 00:29:00,252
He can speak!

296
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,630
Give him some time.

297
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:08,420
I'm sure he's just choosing
his words with great care.

298
00:29:10,338 --> 00:29:11,988
You can keep that.

299
00:29:12,755 --> 00:29:14,755
Won't you stay a while?

300
00:29:22,213 --> 00:29:24,003
He has returned...

301
00:29:28,297 --> 00:29:30,147
to his mother's arms.

302
00:29:32,713 --> 00:29:34,423
He is a miracle.

303
00:29:35,588 --> 00:29:37,438
Never forget that.

304
00:29:46,797 --> 00:29:49,007
So what are you doing here?

305
00:29:49,255 --> 00:29:53,125
I'm trying to fill in some holes

306
00:29:53,213 --> 00:29:55,883
in just a few of my old case files.

307
00:29:56,297 --> 00:29:58,327
For the sake of closure.

308
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:03,060
May I speak with the child?

309
00:30:05,797 --> 00:30:07,617
Michael is sleeping.

310
00:30:08,422 --> 00:30:09,882
In the day?

311
00:30:10,588 --> 00:30:12,338
He isn't feeling well.

312
00:30:12,422 --> 00:30:15,882
Has Michael mentioned anything
at all about his family?

313
00:30:19,755 --> 00:30:22,195
Michael wants to let all of that go.

314
00:30:23,505 --> 00:30:25,575
He has a new life now.

315
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:35,210
Has he said their names or
spoken about them at all?

316
00:30:36,255 --> 00:30:37,835
First names?

317
00:30:37,922 --> 00:30:39,382
Nicknames?

318
00:30:42,422 --> 00:30:44,172
The name Ulrich?

319
00:30:44,713 --> 00:30:47,213
He hasn't ever said that to you either?

320
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,310
What about...

321
00:31:00,922 --> 00:31:03,632
any mention of a white devil?

322
00:31:05,005 --> 00:31:06,205
No!

323
00:31:06,838 --> 00:31:10,438
I don't understand the reason
for all of these questions.

324
00:31:11,838 --> 00:31:14,858
Is it all right if I
speak with him tomorrow?

325
00:31:18,672 --> 00:31:20,712
- Yeah.
- All right, then.

326
00:31:21,755 --> 00:31:24,125
If you can think of anything else

327
00:31:25,255 --> 00:31:27,255
give me a call.

328
00:31:31,797 --> 00:31:33,127
Good.

329
00:31:46,922 --> 00:31:48,552
Sleeping pills

330
00:31:50,547 --> 00:31:52,257
I, um...

331
00:31:53,005 --> 00:31:55,545
I've been having
trouble sleeping lately.

332
00:31:56,797 --> 00:31:58,417
I have bad dreams.

333
00:31:59,922 --> 00:32:01,632
One other thing.

334
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:06,152
Do you have a photo of the boy?

335
00:32:06,797 --> 00:32:08,457
Just for the file.

336
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:20,510
Just for the file, right?

337
00:32:27,297 --> 00:32:28,937
Just for the file.

338
00:32:56,088 --> 00:32:58,138
What are you doing here?

339
00:33:01,963 --> 00:33:03,923
Did Claudia send you?

340
00:33:08,547 --> 00:33:11,627
If you think Adam will
take you back, you're wrong.

341
00:33:12,255 --> 00:33:14,285
You've chosen your side.

342
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:17,410
There is no salvation for you.

343
00:33:21,672 --> 00:33:24,072
I know where the last pages are.

344
00:33:24,588 --> 00:33:27,658
And I know how long Adam's
been looking for them.

345
00:33:28,088 --> 00:33:31,258
Don't you think he'd do
whatever it takes to get them?

346
00:33:31,338 --> 00:33:33,188
I don't believe you.

347
00:33:36,422 --> 00:33:38,882
She would never have
told you where they are.

348
00:33:41,672 --> 00:33:43,382
Claudia has them.

349
00:33:57,463 --> 00:34:00,803
In return, I want you to tell
Adam that I wish to come back.

350
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,120
Before the new cycle begins.

351
00:34:04,297 --> 00:34:05,907
You'd forsake her?

352
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:13,172
Surely you can't hate your own
sister the way you hate her.

353
00:34:23,505 --> 00:34:26,305
You might consider it
an offering of peace.

354
00:35:00,213 --> 00:35:01,463
Yeah.

355
00:35:04,963 --> 00:35:07,403
There's someone here to see you.

356
00:35:07,755 --> 00:35:09,165
Oh, all right.

357
00:35:12,463 --> 00:35:13,803
You can go in.

358
00:35:35,672 --> 00:35:37,382
Can I help you?

359
00:35:44,588 --> 00:35:46,958
One brown eye and one blue eye.

360
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:50,640
That is rare.

361
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:53,478
Like my daughter.

362
00:35:54,505 --> 00:35:56,825
You're much too good a person.

363
00:35:58,088 --> 00:36:00,248
Like you have always been.

364
00:36:02,338 --> 00:36:04,818
The world doesn't deserve you.

365
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,760
Excuse me, but...

366
00:36:12,297 --> 00:36:13,837
do I know you?

367
00:36:15,963 --> 00:36:18,423
I am here because I have
to tell you something.

368
00:36:20,755 --> 00:36:22,335
Forgive me.

369
00:36:26,463 --> 00:36:28,333
Forgive you for what?

370
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,960
Everything.

371
00:36:33,297 --> 00:36:35,637
You never deserved any of this.

372
00:36:39,588 --> 00:36:42,478
But sometimes the good
ones get hit the hardest.

373
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:48,958
I don't understand.

374
00:36:51,213 --> 00:36:53,173
You will one day.

375
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:57,497
And I want you to know

376
00:36:58,263 --> 00:37:00,303
that I'm incredibly sorry

377
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:03,270
that things happened
the way they happened.

378
00:37:08,255 --> 00:37:11,545
Either you tell me what
this is all about right now

379
00:37:12,547 --> 00:37:14,657
or please leave my office.

380
00:37:22,755 --> 00:37:24,805
I truly am sorry.

381
00:37:47,922 --> 00:37:50,382
I've been trying to reach you all day.

382
00:37:50,838 --> 00:37:53,758
The gentlemen from the press
waited for over an hour.

383
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,030
And...

384
00:37:56,255 --> 00:37:57,455
- And?
- Um...

385
00:37:57,547 --> 00:37:59,917
I rescheduled the meeting
for 10:30 tomorrow.

386
00:38:00,005 --> 00:38:03,455
After that you have a meeting
with the union representatives.

387
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,060
Cancel all appointments.

388
00:38:10,213 --> 00:38:12,563
One more thing. Your father...

389
00:38:13,713 --> 00:38:15,193
He's here.

390
00:38:17,172 --> 00:38:19,382
I didn't know where to put him.

391
00:38:37,213 --> 00:38:39,063
What are you doing here?

392
00:38:39,484 --> 00:38:41,374
Why didn't you call ahead?

393
00:38:44,505 --> 00:38:48,045
I wanted to talk to you.
It won't take very long.

394
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:50,309
Right now is a really bad time.

395
00:38:50,434 --> 00:38:52,484
You can't just show up here
unannounced.

396
00:38:52,547 --> 00:38:56,207
Set up an appointment with my
secretary that suits us both.

397
00:38:57,422 --> 00:38:58,962
Next week, maybe.

398
00:38:59,047 --> 00:39:00,557
I have cancer.

399
00:39:06,005 --> 00:39:07,415
Prostate.

400
00:39:09,713 --> 00:39:12,133
I didn't want to worry you.

401
00:39:13,963 --> 00:39:16,253
But the cancer is spreading.

402
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:18,980
And I thought

403
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:21,810
it's best that you know.

404
00:39:23,463 --> 00:39:24,673
I...

405
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:30,800
I don't know what to say to you.

406
00:39:31,297 --> 00:39:32,707
It's okay.

407
00:39:34,422 --> 00:39:36,912
I just wanted you to be informed.

408
00:39:38,005 --> 00:39:39,835
I'll be on my way.

409
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:44,015
I'm sure you have plenty
of work to do here.

410
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,800
Papa.

411
00:40:15,755 --> 00:40:18,805
- You're finally back.
- Yes, my princess know-it-all.

412
00:40:20,797 --> 00:40:22,297
Where's Mama?

413
00:40:44,505 --> 00:40:46,565
You look kind of sad.

414
00:40:50,255 --> 00:40:52,725
I have a secret. Think you can keep it?

415
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:01,918
I believe I saw a witch today.

416
00:41:02,672 --> 00:41:04,922
- There are no witches.
- Yes, there are.

417
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:07,258
This one is real.

418
00:41:09,297 --> 00:41:11,357
What did she look like?

419
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,380
Long white hair.

420
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:16,760
Like in the books.

421
00:41:17,547 --> 00:41:19,307
And what did she say?

422
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:24,170
That she was sorry.

423
00:41:26,672 --> 00:41:29,172
That doesn't sound like a witch.

424
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:36,090
Well how would you know
that? You've never seen one.

425
00:41:39,463 --> 00:41:41,063
Those for Mum?

426
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:48,090
Yes.

427
00:41:51,172 --> 00:41:53,584
You're much too good a person, Papa.

428
00:41:53,609 --> 00:41:55,636
The world doesn't deserve you.

429
00:42:05,505 --> 00:42:06,955
Are you okay?

430
00:42:11,088 --> 00:42:12,338
Yeah.

431
00:42:14,755 --> 00:42:16,475
Just déjà vu.

432
00:42:17,048 --> 00:42:18,646
I used to think

433
00:42:18,671 --> 00:42:22,502
the worst thing that
could happen in life

434
00:42:23,672 --> 00:42:25,842
was to lose your child.

435
00:42:27,005 --> 00:42:29,405
But we can't do anything about it.

436
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:35,880
You try to keep them close
for as long as you can.

437
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:40,838
And, inevitably, they always leave us.

438
00:42:41,797 --> 00:42:43,127
Parents,

439
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,130
children,

440
00:42:45,713 --> 00:42:48,463
they only share the same path

441
00:42:48,547 --> 00:42:51,287
for a small portion
of their time on earth.

442
00:42:52,297 --> 00:42:53,937
At the end...

443
00:42:54,547 --> 00:42:57,187
they're miles apart from each other.

444
00:43:05,088 --> 00:43:06,758
Last winter

445
00:43:08,005 --> 00:43:10,545
a stranger in Winden turned up.

446
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,992
Just a boy.

447
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:17,090
He said something
peculiar to me at the time.

448
00:43:17,797 --> 00:43:20,207
It doesn't make any sense, but...

449
00:43:21,797 --> 00:43:25,547
Or maybe the cancer is
already driving me crazy.

450
00:43:32,213 --> 00:43:34,383
Do you know this child?

451
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,480
He is here?

452
00:43:48,088 --> 00:43:49,798
Where is he?

453
00:43:49,922 --> 00:43:52,062
You knew that he was here.

454
00:43:52,672 --> 00:43:55,342
You knew this entire time, didn't you?

455
00:43:55,422 --> 00:43:57,262
Where is he? Where is he?

456
00:43:57,338 --> 00:43:59,338
Tell me where he is!

457
00:43:59,422 --> 00:44:01,672
- Stop it!
- Tell me!

458
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:05,760
Tell me where he is right now!

459
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:08,458
Come on! Come on! Get him.

460
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:13,920
- Let me go!
- Get the restraints!

461
00:44:20,105 --> 00:44:22,475
I'm closed for the day.

462
00:44:26,713 --> 00:44:28,763
Oh, it's you. I...

463
00:44:29,713 --> 00:44:31,803
It's... it's not ready yet.

464
00:44:32,797 --> 00:44:36,087
It will take 33 years
until the device is ready.

465
00:44:36,172 --> 00:44:38,762
This thing, this... the blueprint.

466
00:44:38,838 --> 00:44:40,958
I don't understand what it is.

467
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:50,760
I've seen that before.

468
00:44:52,588 --> 00:44:55,798
All our lives we wonder
where our journey will take us.

469
00:44:56,422 --> 00:44:57,922
This is yours.

470
00:44:58,005 --> 00:45:00,084
You can keep it.
I don't need it anymore.

471
00:45:00,109 --> 00:45:02,329
Why are you giving it to me?

472
00:45:02,963 --> 00:45:04,853
I will be dead soon.

473
00:45:05,547 --> 00:45:06,707
I...

474
00:45:06,797 --> 00:45:08,457
don't understand.

475
00:45:08,713 --> 00:45:10,193
You will.

476
00:45:11,047 --> 00:45:12,477
One day.

477
00:45:13,005 --> 00:45:15,285
And then we will meet again.

478
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:17,862
Before you die?

479
00:45:19,088 --> 00:45:20,708
No, after.

480
00:45:21,755 --> 00:45:23,005
How?

481
00:45:23,713 --> 00:45:25,943
How would that be possible?

482
00:45:26,213 --> 00:45:28,273
Time is an illusion.

483
00:45:29,547 --> 00:45:31,587
You'll show me how the device works.

484
00:45:31,672 --> 00:45:33,351
But I don't even know
what it does.

485
00:45:33,376 --> 00:45:35,196
Why won't you
tell me what it does?

486
00:45:35,255 --> 00:45:38,705
Because you told me someone
else explained it to you.

487
00:45:39,463 --> 00:45:42,663
Things take their course
the way they always have.

488
00:45:43,422 --> 00:45:45,422
I never told you anything.

489
00:45:45,505 --> 00:45:47,375
Nobody explained anything.

490
00:45:47,463 --> 00:45:49,093
Not now.

491
00:45:49,172 --> 00:45:51,092
In the future.

492
00:45:51,172 --> 00:45:53,372
This will all be ending soon.

493
00:45:54,588 --> 00:45:58,018
But till then everything
must stay as it's always been.

494
00:45:59,338 --> 00:46:01,588
Wait, don't. Please!

495
00:48:00,047 --> 00:48:02,287
You thought you could trust her.

496
00:48:06,005 --> 00:48:07,845
She betrayed you.

497
00:48:09,463 --> 00:48:11,733
She didn't even bat an eye.

498
00:48:13,463 --> 00:48:16,283
You took it all from me.

499
00:48:17,838 --> 00:48:19,658
You're going to die.

500
00:48:19,963 --> 00:48:22,613
And with you dies all you stand for.

501
00:48:23,047 --> 00:48:25,517
I knew I was going to die.

502
00:48:26,922 --> 00:48:29,412
But am I going to lose this round?

503
00:48:29,505 --> 00:48:33,185
Or is this, our meeting,
you and your gun,

504
00:48:33,963 --> 00:48:37,463
is it just part of a game you
still don't know how to play?

505
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:41,297
You think you can manipulate
me with more of your speeches?

506
00:48:43,963 --> 00:48:46,503
I'm not one of your pawns anymore.

507
00:48:47,172 --> 00:48:49,262
But Adam plays you still.

508
00:48:50,213 --> 00:48:53,963
The paradise he's promised
you is nothing but a lie.

509
00:48:54,463 --> 00:48:57,463
He is selling you the
illusion of freedom.

510
00:48:58,255 --> 00:49:01,205
Ask yourself, are you truly free?

511
00:49:01,297 --> 00:49:03,357
If you were truly free,

512
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:07,400
you would have a choice.

513
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,410
Do you have a choice?

514
00:49:52,588 --> 00:49:56,668
UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN'S BODY
FOUND IN WOODS

515
00:50:39,838 --> 00:50:41,518
That can't...

516
00:50:46,338 --> 00:50:47,588
Charlotte?

517
00:50:48,172 --> 00:50:49,772
That's not true.

518
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,960
No, that can't be right.

519
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:53,900
This isn't true.

520
00:51:17,588 --> 00:51:20,668
No matter how much we fight it,

521
00:51:22,463 --> 00:51:25,303
we are connected by our blood.

522
00:51:30,422 --> 00:51:33,342
We can feel estranged from our families

523
00:51:33,422 --> 00:51:35,982
and not understand what they do.

524
00:51:39,213 --> 00:51:42,903
And still, in the end,
we will do anything for them.

525
00:51:47,133 --> 00:51:48,923
A common thread

526
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:53,880
that connects all our lives
to each other.

527
00:52:01,713 --> 00:52:04,013
And did she have the pages?

528
00:52:15,838 --> 00:52:18,508
She got exactly
what she deserved.

529
00:52:23,047 --> 00:52:25,357
In the end we will all get

530
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:28,160
just what we deserve.
