{\an8}A daughter lost, a son found.

00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,840
{\an8}He is yours.

[Nelson] <i>Since you have proven
your commitment,</i>

6
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,120
Boston is now officially open
for the importation of your merchandise.

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,200
Jack says a few more weeks,
and you'll be free.

8
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,280
The stories about you come up the canal.

<i>Once you walked fine alone,
now you need a stick.</i>

[Tommy] <i>Stay clean for two weeks.</i>

11
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,560
I'll write Linda another letter.

12
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,520
[Holford] <i>Have you recently
suffered seizures?</i>

13
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,960
<i>It is tuberculoma.</i>

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:46,920
I am afraid it is inoperable.

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,880
[pulsing music playing]

16
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,000
Mr Shelby, I only gave
opium to your brother

17
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,120
because he give me big trouble.

18
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,480
He attacked my wife.

19
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,520
[timer ticking]

20
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,560
I'd like a pot of green tea, please.

21
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,600
[ticking continues]

22
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,320
[clears throat]

23
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,480
It's taken me ten years
to build this business.

24
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,040
Your business will be safe
if you do what I say.

25
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,800
How much opium do you have in your cellar?

26
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,600
Five pounds.

27
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,920
Bring it to me.

28
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,560
Four minutes against the clock.

29
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,000
[exhales]

30
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,720
[Tommy] As a Member of Parliament...

31
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,080
for this constituency,

32
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,960
it is my duty to take responsibility
for the welfare of my constituents.

33
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,200
The clock is still ticking.

34
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,760
Consumption of opium
is very prejudicial to health.

35
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,000
Women give it to their children

36
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,680
so they can leave them untended
while they work in the factories.

37
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,760
Men lose their jobs
when they become addicted.

38
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:02,920
[clicks tongue] From now on, you will sell
only cigarettes, cake and tea.

39
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,760
If I hear that you're selling opium again,

40
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,560
time will indeed run out
very quickly for you, understand?

41
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,440
Yes. I understand. I will stop.

42
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,480
Mr Shelby, the clock is still ticking.

43
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,600
[in Chinese]
I don't think it's a real bomb.

44
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,320
[in English] Please tell
your suppliers and your customers

45
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,960
that from now on,
there will be no more opium

46
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,120
in Small Heath or in Bordesley.

47
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,560
Thank you for the tea.

48
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,320
[Li in Chinese] You see.
It was not a real bomb.

49
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,320

[dogs barking]

52
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,840
[Tommy] You can let 'em through now.

53
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,480
[officer] Yes, sir, Mr Shelby.

54
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,400
You tell the pub and cafe owners
on Montague Street,

55
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,760
if there's any further trade in powder,
there will be no more Montague Street.

56
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,240
I'll have it demolished
and replaced by apartments.

57
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,040
By order
of the Birmingham Urban District Council.

58
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,880
[machine whirring]

59
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,800
Sorry, I'm late.

60
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,480
They closed Montague Street.
There was a gas explosion or...

61
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,600
It would be nice if just one thing
could happen in Birmingham

62
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,960
that wasn't our fault.

63
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,600
I've gathered you all here today
because there is news.

64
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,480
It is of interest to the whole family.

65
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:16,880
First of all,

66
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,920
I'd like to welcome
Finn's new wife, Mary, to the family.

67
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,640
[smacks lips] I'm very glad
that I dragged myself out of bed for this.

68
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,720
[sighs] There is
one more item of business.

69
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,360
-Johnny.
-Tom.

70
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,280
[footsteps receding]

71
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,960
Come on. Come on, will you?

72
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,240
Everyone,

73
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,880
this here is Erasmus.

74
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,440
Nobody calls me that.

75
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,000
[clicks tongue] They call him Duke.

76
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,920
[sighs] Twenty years ago,
at Appleby Horse Fair, I met a girl.

77
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,040
We shared the shade of a hazel tree.

78
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,360
[Ada exhales]

79
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,560
Nine months later, this lad was born.

80
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,400
[clicks tongue]

81
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,520
This is my son.

82
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,040
His mother died on the road.

83
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,400
Up until now, I never tried to find him.

84
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,520
But I'm trying
to look at life in a different way.

85
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,080
A child is a precious thing.

86
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,760
So I'm bringing him...

87
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,520
Into the fucking family
with a snap of his fingers.

88
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,080
[Tommy] No. Bringing him into the fold.

89
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,000
He'll have to earn
membership of the family.

90
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,080
For the moment, welcome, son.
You have a seat, go on. Sit down here.

91
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,040
There are some mistakes I've made
that I can never redress.

92
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,280
Some I can.

93
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,320
Some wounds I can try to heal.

94
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,360
New wounds you can open up.

95
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,440
Anyway, that's the business of the day.

96
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,680
[Tommy clears throat]

97
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,560
Is it too early for whiskey?

98
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,680
There you go.

99
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,760
Shelby breakfast for you, son.

100
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,400
I don't drink.

101
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,760
And I'm not a Shelby.

102
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,320
-All right? I'm a Duke.
-[Dogs scoffs]

103
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,560
[chuckles]

104
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,760
You're a fucking Shelby, all right.
Don't worry about that.

105
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,560
[grunts]

106
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,120
I think we'll need Curly and a strong rope
to break this one in, Tom.

107
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,080
Arthur, open up the shop.

108
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:44,680
Put the kid here on the blackboard,
writing up the odds.

109
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,400
I can't write.

110
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,440
Put the kid here on the blackboard,
wiping off the chalk.

111
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,480
[Arthur snorts]

112
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,040
Go on, son.

113
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,360
Come on, then.

114
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,400
[door opens]

115
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,320
[door closes]

116
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,320
Lizzie.

117
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,240
Come on.

118
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,760
[Duke] My father
was the Duke of Saxon Shore.

119
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,000
My mother was a Romani queen.

120
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,760
[Arthur] Who told you that, your mum?

121
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,160
I don't allow people
to talk about my mother.

122
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,880
Good for you.

123
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,280
So let's get this right, then.
You can't read.

124
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,560
You can't fucking write.
Nothing wrong with that.

125
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,280
What can you do, eh?

126
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:46,280
I can tell the time.

127
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,240
Tell the time.

128
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,080
Here, he can tell the time.

129
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,920
Ain't that clever?

130
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,640
It's a lot more
than what you can fucking do.

131
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,280
[Arthur] What did you just say to me?

132
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,240
What time is it, Mr Shelby?

133
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,840
That's what I can do.

134
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,200
You little bastard.

135
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,520
[chuckles]

136
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,080
Here. Keep it.

137
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
Stop you from being late in the future.

138
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:26,360
[footsteps approaching]

139
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,800
Is there forgiveness in your heart
for Arthur Shelby?

140
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,200
No.

141
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,040
But there may be forgiveness from God.

142
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,040
[clicks tongue]

143
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,680
And you will do God's work.

144
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,520
God is interested in you as well, Tommy.

145
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,160
God will be with you on your journey.
Every step of the way.

146
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,520
He may not need to take many steps.

147
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,240
So tell me this, Linda.

148
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,360
Is God interested in me

149
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,720
or in my money?

150
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,920
[exhales]

151
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,480
I believe you run a foundation,

152
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,720
and that your foundation
has many missions across the world.

153
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,920
But in these times of financial crisis,
funding is hard to come by.

154
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,120
[sniffs] So, perhaps,
your God's plan is a practical one.

155
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,960
Perhaps he would like me
to make a donation to your foundation.

156
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,200
And in return, he would like you

157
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,520
to help my brother
on his road to redemption.

158
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,120
Now, I know
that in a place of worship such as this,

159
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,960
you would never ask how much.

160
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,760
So I will tell you plainly.

161
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:18,400
I will write your foundation
a check for £10,000...

162
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,400
Praise the Lord.

163
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,040
...if you agree to look kindly
on Arthur and to help him.

164
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,360
I need to look after
everyone in the family.

165
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:31,960
Do we have a deal?

166
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,240
Your money will be spent
to do good around the world.

167
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,720
And a mission will be named after you.

168
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,640
[scoffs]

169
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,720
But I'm only agreeing to help him,

170
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,880
not sleep with him.

171
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,760
No.

172
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,000
No, I imagine the negotiation
for that particular favour

173
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,240
would take a considerable amount of time.

174
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,000
And I have an appointment.

175
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,160
[Tommy] God bless.

176
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,480
[indistinct chattering]

177
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,720
[seagulls squawking]

178
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,800
Apologies for
the initial misunderstanding.

179
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,320
My brother dealt with it.

180
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,560
[clicks tongue]

181
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,640
For the care you took.

182
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,920
Even though I succumbed to temptation?

183
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,320
Part of the reason my brother is back
dealing with it, is down to you.

184
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,880
You spoke to him.

185
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,640
As a comrade.

186
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,320
The beating is still owed to you.

187
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,960
Do you still do that kind of work
yourself, Thomas Shelby, MP?

188
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,080
Mr Stagg, you see,
I can use a man like you.

189
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,360
I have friends that are in need of guns.

190
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,520
Soon there will be a shipment

191
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,440
of Thompson submachine guns,
coming here from Boston.

192
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,160
I need you to unload
and store those weapons.

193
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,640
There will also be ammunition.

194
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,000
Like this.

195
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:29,560
You have a good look.

196
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,240
And I need you to take better care
of the guns and ammunition

197
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,240
than you did of the powder.

198
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,760
You understand?

199
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,160
Previously,

200
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,000
all of my import and export
went through Belfast docks.

201
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,280
Now we're dealing with Boston...

202
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,120
I am considering shifting
my supply line to Liverpool.

203
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,520
You'd be a very rich man.

204
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,320
Don't you ever say thank you?

205
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,760
Thank you.

206
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,800
Is that why you do it, Mr Shelby?

207
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,160
Is that why you keep all this going?

208
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,400
To help people say thank you?

209
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,120
You could close all this down.

210
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,040
You could leave the sport behind.

211
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,600
You could live
like an ordinary, mortal man.

212
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,520
On your gravestone.

213
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,000
"An ordinary, mortal man."

214
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,680
But instead,
you still go around collecting "please,"

215
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,960
and "thank you," and "sorry,"
and "forgive me, Mr Shelby."

216
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,360
That what it's all for?

217
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,560
You want to know?

218
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,720
You want to know why I've carried on...

219
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,320
[inhales and exhales]

220
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,480
...all these years?

221
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,280
It's so I can do this.

222
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,880
And then

223
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,280
do this.

224
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,400
Feel it?

225
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,440
I feel it.

226
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,520
Junk doesn't even come close.

227
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,120
[sighs]

228
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,240
Soon, Mr Stagg,

229
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,480
when my last bit of business is done,

230
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,160
I will, indeed,

231
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,400
be an ordinary, mortal man.

232
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,840
You have a good day.

233
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,360
[Finn] Arthur.

234
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,440
We've got a problem with the referee.

235
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,640
He's not taking the money.
He's fucking religious or something.

236
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,480
[Arthur] Jesus Christ.

237
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,600
With Tommy away, you're in charge
of gambling, Arthur. What should we do?

238
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,560
"And this they said to him,

239
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,640
that they may have some charge
to bring against him."

240
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,760
Arthur.

241
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,400
This referee is threatening
to go to the police...

242
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,680
"Jesus bent down

243
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,320
and with one finger,
he wrote on the ground."

244
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,240
Arthur. [sighs]

245
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,240
Brother.

246
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,480
People are laughing at you.

247
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,360
So, I just phoned our holy referee again.

248
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,240
He basically told me to fuck off.

249
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,800
Not even basically, actually.

250
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,840
He literally just told me... to fuck off.

251
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,640
[Arthur] Is that right?

252
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,080
So, do you know?

253
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,320
[Finn sighs] For fuck's sake.

254
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,400
-Do you know what he wrote on the ground?
-No.

255
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:08,080
-Do you know? You don't know, do you?
-No. No, I don't.

256
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,000
Billy, do you know what he wrote
on the ground?

257
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,680
-I...
-Hmm?

258
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,680
Do you know what Jesus wrote
on the ground?

259
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,360
He bent down and with one finger,
he wrote on the fucking ground.

260
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,400
You know? Do you know what he wrote?

261
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,240
-Come on, Billy.
-[groans] No.

262
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,080
[Finn] Arthur, what should we do?

263
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,480
[Arthur] Go and get me the referee.

264
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,120
Bring me the fucking referee.

265
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,080
[Finn grunts]

266
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,040
[both breathing heavily]

267
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,120
[Tommy exhales]

268
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
[Lizzie exhales]

269
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,400
[Tommy] I know she's here with us.

270
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,360
Always.

271
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,080
But still it's just you and me.

272
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,640
I thought it would be good
if we were in a different place.

273
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,360
I hate that house now.

274
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,200
I wish I could blow it up.

275
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,440
There was a time
when we'd say nothing afterwards

276
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,480
because we didn't have to say anything.

277
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,680
But now we've got nothing left to say.

278
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,160
There's business.

279
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,840
What business?

280
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,680
The American.

281
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,320
He's coming to Birmingham.

282
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:58,480
He's stopping over
on his way to Liverpool.

283
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,560
He's staying with us tomorrow night.

284
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,840
Frances knows. She's making up a menu.

285
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,240
And then,

286
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,160
we have to make a move.

287
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,440
Do you want to know
what that move is, Lizzie?

288
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,640
No.

289
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,400
I know enough.

290
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,960
Your book of regrets.

291
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:41,040
23, 24, 52, 55.

292
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,400
Combination to the safe.

293
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,520
Regrets.

294
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,120
And I'm on there.

295
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,040
I'm on the list.

296
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,120
On the very top of the list.

297
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,160
[glass clinks]

298
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,080
[Tommy clicks tongue] Yep.

299
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,440
Yes, you are.

300
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,840
I regret marrying you, Lizzie.

301
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,440
Because I put you through so much.

302
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,240
Put you through all of this.

303
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,280
Ruby.

304
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,160
Everything that is to come.

305
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:35,200
When you married me, you married a man
and you married a curse.

306
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,880
You have shared my fate.

307
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,960
That is my regret.

308
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,600
But know this, Lizzie.

309
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,720
In this moment,

310
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,680
in this room...

311
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,680
I love you.

312
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,880
You sound like
you're ticking a fucking box,

313
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,160
and I don't know what's inside the box.

314
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,000
Never have you let me in.

315
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,360
Even though I know
the combination to the safe.

316
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,960
[Lizzie breathing heavily]

317
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,280
[Arthur] So this is him, is it?

318
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,240
You're the one
that likes to be fucking difficult, eh?

319
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,000
When I leave this place,
I'm going straight to the police.

320
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,400
-[Arthur] You are?
-This man pointed a gun at me.

321
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,480
-Who? Him there?
-[Wilfred] Yeah.

322
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,040
Well, let's phone the police, eh?

323
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,800
Don't worry.
We'll have this sorted out for you.

324
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,800
Hello. Yes.

325
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,520
Get me the police.

326
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,080
Reports of a man

Chief Superintendent Moss.

00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,880
He's in charge of Watery Lane

That's right.

That's his betting credit with us.

He makes a lot of money
from football matches

Bow your head, Arthur,
and close your eyes.

Recite the prayer. You know it well
from when you were a boy.

That spring in Appleby Fair,
your mother stole my watch and chain.

You're from a long line of thieves.

499

"Saxon Shore" carved in it.

from a drunk when I was a kid.

501

I imagine she told you, your dad
was the Duke of the Saxon Shore. Well...

502
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,680
[clicks tongue] I am the Duke.

503
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,840
It was my watch.

00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,000
I'm your father.

505
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,640
That's the truth.

506
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,600
When her dad found out, he shot me
in the chest with a squirrel gun.

507
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:48,560
A scar, a stolen watch
and a story she made up.

508
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,960
That's all you need to know about yourself
before you get on the road.

509
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,760
Esme tells me the spirits favour you.

510

That the spirit is in you.

511

She tried to sell me like
one of those horses, didn't she?

How much did you pay for me?

513

I have no use for gold any more.

514

Horses are better than people, mind you.

544

There's work here

I want to remain completely unknown.

You'd be in the right place for that
as well. No one knows anyone here.

548
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,240
Hey, mister, save that wheel a minute.

The currency here,

it's blood.

And Mr Shelby knows that
better than all of them.

688

Blood here is like wine,
like vintage wine in that bottle.

It's the label.

It's the <i>terroir.</i>
It's the grape that makes the wine.

You fucking smash the glass,

00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:26,440
Five million dollars, Mrs Shelby.
Worth a little cruise, don't you think?

705
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,000
You know, whiskey does talk,

very eloquent.

708

But five million dollars, Mr Nelson...

A Rolls Royce.

717
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,200
Were you expecting more guests?

00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:16,720
No.

719
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:25,800
Excuse me.

720
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,120
We were on our way
to my constituency in Smethwick

721
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:39,680
and I heard our American friend
was in Birmingham and he was coming here.

722
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:43,720
So we came to say one last farewell.

723
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,600
Champagne. We have much to celebrate.

724
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:01,160
It's not that I thought Mr Shelby
wouldn't give you an excellent send-off,

725
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,240
I just felt,

726
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:08,480
since telegrams and wires and letters
can so easily be intercepted,

727
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:13,120
we might confirm all that we've achieved
during your visit over champagne.

728
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:17,520
It is remarkable how quickly
our relationships have developed.

729
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:19,920
So many triangles in this room.

730
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:24,000
Everyone, except for Mr Nelson,
is the point of a triangle.

731
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,200
How am I part of a triangle?

732
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:31,560
Mr Nelson, you have all that you came for?

733
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:33,800
I have confirmation
that the future of Europe

734
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:36,600
is in the hands of men like yourselves.

And that urgent conversations
between Washington, Rome

736
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,760
and, of course, Berlin can now begin.

737
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:48,320
A two-week visit
may have changed the course of history.

a spouse who's more suitable.
