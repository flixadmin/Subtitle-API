I know it's a big change,
but if tonight goes well...

322
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,045
-...it's yours.
-Oh.

323
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:40,922
Uh, w-well, great.

324
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:44,509
-Mm-hmm.
-Um, that's... great.

325
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:46,761
Well, you know, I've never been
to an estate before.

326
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:48,430
-Mm.
-Um, do you guys have stables?

327
00:14:48,513 --> 00:14:50,223
<i>[Tek-Knight laughing]</i>

328
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:52,934
Let's get the tour started inside.

329
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:55,228
-Okay? Come on. [chuckles]
-[Hughie] Okay. Got it.

330
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:58,231
[Sage] What happened to you?

331
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,442
You look like you got ass-fucked
by the business end of a hammer.

332
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:02,694
Well, maybe I don't want to be
at this CPAC nightmare

333
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,362
any more than they want me here.

334
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:06,489
There's gonna be
a little sidebar later on.

335
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,450
One percent of the one percent.

336
00:15:08,533 --> 00:15:12,037
Sage here is going to lube them up
with cognac and Montecristos,

337
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,165
and then convince them
to commit a little high treason.

338
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:16,374
I'm sorry, what the fuck?

339
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,418
Why would I expose myself like that?

340
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,670
Because in this room
is 38% of the U.S. GDP.

341
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:24,591
And if we have a shot in hell of pulling
off the 25th Amendment, we need them.

342
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,718
Do you want to be el jefe or not?

343
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:32,349
Good. Now, you're the virgin at prom.

344
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,100
Go get finger-popped.

345
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:37,479
Oh, hey.

346
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,148
You hear about Stan Edgar?

347
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:42,567
Well, what about him?

348
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:45,445
Well, apparently,
he got released from prison.

349
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:52,327
Hmm. Details are fairly sketchy as to why.

350
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:56,164
How. But, yeah, he got out.

351
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:58,291
Hasn't been seen since.

352
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,793
Well, he's nothing if not slippery.

353
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:02,003
I'm surprised it didn't happen sooner.

354
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:06,007
He can't hurt us.

355
00:16:06,091 --> 00:16:08,134
Mm-hmm.

356
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:21,690
That's why I went
to the Safdies to direct.

[Mother's Milk] <i>Okay, Hughie, check in.</i>

358
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,444
-No more PG-13 bullshit.
-Oh, wow, I love these,
uh, these orchid prints

00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,826
Oh, wow.

361
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:36,996
I love your study. So many books.

362
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,375
[Tek-Knight] Got the original
Beecher Stowe <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin.</i>

363
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,501
-Cool.
-Mm-hmm.

364
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,086
Cool, cool.

365
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:46,923
Now, look, uh, I don't do this
for just anybody, but, uh...

366
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,216
you want to see the Tek Cave?

367
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:49,718
The Tek Ca... Uh...

368
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:52,679
S-Sure, I mean, uh, fuck yeah, dawg.

369

Oh, it's one of those pull-the-book,

Oh, wow.

[water dripping]

381
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:35,972
This is the Tek Cave. Cool, cool.

382
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,224
[Tek-Knight] Ah, you've met Elijah.

383
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:40,685
Raised me since I lost my parents.

384
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:43,354
He's like a dad to me.

385
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:44,856
Isn't that right, Elijah?

386
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:47,442
That's correct, Master Knight.

387
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,989
There's nothing greater
than a father's guiding hand.

388
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,491
You know?

389
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:56,743
That's for sure.

390
00:17:56,826 --> 00:18:00,914
Jesus. You didn't get all the santorum
off the gibbet cage!

391
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:02,248
It'll be taken care of, sir.

I don't like liars.

No, I'm fine.

00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,242
I get it.

This is all a little vanilla for you.

But... don't worry.

Tonight, we're really
gonna push ourselves...

G-Get out of his chair.
What are you doing?

You know what's funny? I hate sake.

420
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:14,529
But I'm supposed to follow
some stupid Black ninja bullshit,

421
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:16,239
which makes no goddamn sense,
by the way.

422
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:17,991
You ever meet a Black ninja?

423
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,367
Lower your voice.

424
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,702
There's nobody here.

425
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:23,371
They left us like babies
so they could go do important stuff.

-We don't matter.
-Hey.

427
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,126
Speak for yourself.
I'm doing a ton of important shit.

428
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,627
Yeah? Like what?

429
00:19:29,711 --> 00:19:32,505
Need-to-know, bro.
Need-to-fucking-know.

430
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:34,799
Fuck it. I'm done with all this shit.

431
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:36,092
You're quitting?

432
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,636
What are you gonna do?
Seven's the biggest gig there is.

433
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,388
Look, I don't understand Noir, okay?

434
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:41,639
You know there was nothing in his closet

435
00:19:41,723 --> 00:19:45,268
but literally like seven file boxes
of shitty Buster Beaver drawings?

436
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:46,644
Why'd he have that?

437
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:47,770
Who the fuck knows or cares?

438
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:51,816
[sighs] I'm going to Missouri tomorrow.

439
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,361
I booked Cirque de Vought's new show,
<i>VIVANT! Music of the Bee Gees.</i>

440
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:57,196
Three nights a week in Branson.

441
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,823
They're gonna let me fly.

442
00:19:58,907 --> 00:20:00,491
I can fly, did you know that?

443
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:04,078
Yeah, dude, we all know that.
Look, why didn't you just come to me?

444
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:06,039
About what?

445
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:08,291
Seriously? Dude.

446
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,337
[sighs] Man, me and the old Noir?

447
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:16,299
We were like great bros, like real bros.

448
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:18,259
[sighs] Give me this.

449

[glassware clinking]

450
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:26,851
Few years ago, Noir cleared out
an entire Indonesian fishing village.

451
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:29,729
Vought Fresh Farms was expanding
their palm oil plantation,

452
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:31,773
but the locals were bitching
'cause they needed the river

453
00:20:31,856 --> 00:20:34,651
to survive or whatever the fuck.

454
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:37,528
Noir "cancelled" two dozen of 'em.

455
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:39,572
Came back with
a raging hard-on for a week.

456
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:40,657
[chuckles]

457
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,409
No, dude, see, what you're not getting

458
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:47,580
is how horny killing made the old Noir.

459
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:48,915
That was his whole thing.

460
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:51,250
But I don't really like violence.

461
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:53,544
[inhales, sighs]

462
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:59,008
Look, I know this
is hard to imagine, but...

463
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:00,468
some people laugh at me.

464
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:02,011
[chuckles] It's crazy, right?

465
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:03,221
Yeah.

466
00:21:04,389 --> 00:21:06,307
But you know what I realized?

467
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:08,893
When I crush someone's nose
into the back of their skull

468
00:21:08,977 --> 00:21:12,188
or beat 'em so bad
that they'll never walk again?

469
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,108
[chuckles] They're not laughing anymore.

470
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,610
They show respect.

471
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:22,031
Violence is power.

472
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:26,995
I'm starting to get why
it gave Noir so much chub.

473
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:34,252
-[app voice] <i>Let your intention connect.</i>
-[Annie] Oh, something is wrong.

Something is really, really wrong.

We should've never sent him in there.

Everything that's been
going on with his dad, I mean...

-Annie, I hear you.

Listen, mate, no one

1133
00:57:18,227 --> 00:57:19,979
ever said nothing about genocide.

1134
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:23,315
-Is that a fucking joke?
-He's insane.

1135
00:57:23,399 --> 00:57:25,651
[Kessler] Who was it that said,
"They all got to go"?

1136
00:57:25,734 --> 00:57:27,111
"Every fucking last one of 'em."

1137
00:57:27,194 --> 00:57:29,697
[Becca] He's talking about murder, Billy.

1138
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:32,158
-Of thousands.
-Think how much better the world would be.

1139
00:57:32,241 --> 00:57:34,493
And a lot of them are innocent, okay?
I know you...

1140
00:57:34,577 --> 00:57:36,829
Shut your fucking cake hole, bitch!

1141
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:42,418
Wait a minute... [stammers]

1142
00:57:44,086 --> 00:57:46,088
You can see her?

1143
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,600
What the fuck's
that supposed to mean, you're me?

1144
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:01,478
I mean, out of all the fucking people

1145
00:58:01,562 --> 00:58:05,191
that your festering fucked-up brain
could've conjured up,

1146
00:58:05,274 --> 00:58:07,234
you picked me.

1147
00:58:09,028 --> 00:58:11,280
The real Joe Kessler?

1148
00:58:11,363 --> 00:58:14,116
He's dead in the Panjshir Valley,
motherfucker.

1149
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,534
You never dragged me out.

1150
00:58:15,618 --> 00:58:17,077
You left me to die.

1151
00:58:17,161 --> 00:58:19,830
I'll be back at the head of the table
in no time.

1152
00:58:20,873 --> 00:58:21,707
No.

1153
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:23,876
We'll get Ryan's head clear,
and that's it.

1154
00:58:23,959 --> 00:58:25,461
Fuck all this cloak and dagger shite.

1155
00:58:25,544 --> 00:58:26,921
It's bloody freezing out here.

1156
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:29,298
We'll patch you up right as rain.

1157
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:33,427
No. No.

1158
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:35,429
No, I'd remember that.

1159
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:36,972
I'd fucking remember that.

1160
00:58:37,056 --> 00:58:38,849
[Kessler] Unless of course
you've got a big, old,

1161
00:58:38,933 --> 00:58:40,726
fat, V'd-up brain tumor, you cunt.

1162
00:58:40,809 --> 00:58:43,604
Which is why you are
seeing me in the first place.

1163
00:58:46,774 --> 00:58:49,193
[Kessler] I killed Ezekiel for you.

1164
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:51,820
I am inside of you.

1165
00:58:51,904 --> 00:58:53,864
I am you.

1166
00:58:53,948 --> 00:58:56,909
Which is why when I tell you
you want to do this,

1167
00:58:56,992 --> 00:58:59,119
I am literally telling you

1168
00:58:59,203 --> 00:59:01,455
that you fucking want to do this.

1169
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,961
So don't you worry, Billy, my boy.

1170
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:11,382
Daddy's home.
