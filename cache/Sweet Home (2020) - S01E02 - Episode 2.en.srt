ORIGINAL STORY SWEET HOME
BY CARNBY KIM AND YOUNGCHAN HWANG

2
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:09,864
CHA HYUN-SU, 19-YEAR OLD HIGH SCHOOLER
CURRENTLY REFUSING TO ATTEND SCHOOL

3
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:13,568
HIKIKOMORI WITH HISTORY OF
HABITUAL SELF-HARM

4
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:15,776
MOM
HYUN-SU, ARE YOU SURE YOU AREN'T COMING?

5
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,458
It'll be a good change of scenery.

6
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:29,511
You haven't been out of your room
in so long.

7
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:40,889
MOM
WE'RE LEAVING

8
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,805
RICE IS IN THE FREEZER.
MAKE SURE YOU EAT, OKAY?

9
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,305
Load ammunition.

10
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,824
How long is Hyun-su
going to behave like that?

11
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:57,196
Why didn't you do anything

12
00:01:57,909 --> 00:01:59,739
to make sure he never got this way?

13
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:00,748
Dad.

14
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,579
It's not Mom's fault.

15
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:03,924
Why are you yelling at her?

16
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,208
Don't give me attitude.

17
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,593
This family's falling apart.

18
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:12,054
You're ridiculous. Since when do you care?

19
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,132
I don't know why I had any children.

20
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,337
They're never grateful for anything.

21
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:18,047
Stop. Both of you.

22
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,468
This is a family trip.

23
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:22,854
Don't be like that.

24
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,685
Sure.

25
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,861
It's all my fault.

26
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:32,778
Dad.

27
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:33,701
Dad!

28
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,754
Is that Hyun-su?
Where the hell have you been?

29
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,921
Don't be like that.
The poor boy must be devastated.

30
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:49,384
He looks like a mess.

31
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:53,835
Hyun-su.

32
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,551
I really didn't want to come outside.

33
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,890
But I couldn't believe it.

34
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:10,859
Only 30 million won.

35
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,228
You're basically telling me to die.

36
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,493
How am I supposed to get by with this?

37
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,237
How can I live on this
for the rest of my life?

38
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,288
What do you want me to do?

39
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,540
- Drag him out.
- Take him.

40
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,832
How can I live?

41
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,499
- What do you want me to do?
- Take him out.

42
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:32,134
Hurry.

43
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,730
How could he just leave him here
like this?

44
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:00,160
Why is he so cold?

45
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,089
TRENDING
MONSTER, STATE OF ALERT, NOSEBLEED

46
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,510
AUDITORY HALLUCINATION,
PANIC BUYING, SHELTER, CHAOS

47
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:21,639
TRENDING
MONSTER, STATE OF ALERT, NOSEBLEED

48
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:27,274
Hey, I'm on my way.

49
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,270
The elevator isn't working,
so I'll be late.

50
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,225
No, the elevator is out of order.

51
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,645
I'm not lying.

52
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:47,794
I can't hear anything.

53
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:49,544
Hello?

54
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:50,712
Oh, no!

55
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,203
Just go.

56
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:28,445
I'm resting.

57
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:07,697
I'm hungry...

58
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:14,826
It's you.

59
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:21,611
Thanks for your help.

60
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,113
LEE SU-UNG

61
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:25,073
Su-ung.

62
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,453
Someone had to do it.

63
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,588
AUGUST 15TH SATURDAY

64
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,420
There's no service, is there?

65
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,424
I'm checking his family's phone number.

66
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:46,626
I should let his family know.

67
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:54,595
SATURDAY, AUGUST 15

68
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:00,024
What are you doing?

69
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,944
They can't see him in person.
This is the least we can do.

70
00:08:03,024 --> 00:08:05,114
It'd be better if his family
didn't see him like this.

71
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:08,066
No.

72
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:11,204
It wouldn't be.

73
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,970
Damn it, the motion sensor
isn't working either.

74
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:41,561
Why is it my fault?
It's not even my problem...

75
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,271
The world's just so fucked...

76
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,688
Excuse me.

77
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,066
That's how the world is.
What hell do I know?

78
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,279
- Excuse me.
- Why is it my fault...

79
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:55,115
It's not my fault, and now
they want to get rid of me?

80
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:01,959
I want to kill them all.

81
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:16,930
Manager Han.

82
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:22,305
Manager Han, that son of a bitch.

83
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,199
Manager Han!

84
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,958
Excuse me.

85
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:51,217
Ji-su.

86
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:52,966
Don't go near him.

87
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,054
He might kill you.

88
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,720
Watch out!

89
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,356
My daughter isn't back yet.

90
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:10,226
You can't block this.

91
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,608
If anything happens to Min-ju,
it's all your fault!

92
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,775
- Please calm down.
- Block it.

93
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:18,486
Please wait.

94
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,790
I said, wait.

95
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,461
She's here.

96
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,959
I'll go get her quickly.

97
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,875
Open it. Please?

98
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:32,916
No.

99
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,966
Who are you to say no?
Do you know who I am?

100
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,425
I can't let this place fall into danger.

101
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,345
Stop, please.

102
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,806
Please open it.

103
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:48,805
It's working.

104
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,655
What's going on?

105
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:01,833
EMERGENCY ALERT

106
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:02,951
Is it an epidemic?

107
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:07,253
That man said he was going to the hospital
this morning.

108
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,173
Did the hospital do a test?

109
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,921
It must be the radiation.

110
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:25,982
SUPERMARKET

111
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,917
THOSE WITH THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS
MUST BE QUARANTINED IMMEDIATELY

112
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,039
NOSEBLEEDS, BLACKOUTS,
OR SUDDEN AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR

113
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,588
7,800 WON
NEW MESSAGE

114
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,435
How come you're so calm?

115
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,028
I am extremely shocked
and nervous right now.

116
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,326
That man...

117
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,909
No, that thing...

118
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,746
Do you think it's dead?

119
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,672
Probably.

120
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,525
Let's all go home.

121
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,664
What are we doing sitting here?

122
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,083
Won't the rescue squad come?

123
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,500
Do you not see this?

124
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:09,709
We're all screwed.

125
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,206
Our country won't go down like this.

126
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,999
Right, Military Man?

127
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,585
Yes. You're right.

128
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:18,841
If you stay calm and wait...

129
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,013
I can wait at home!

130
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,722
There must be an emergency shelter nearby.

131
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,393
Where exactly?

132
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,511
If we drive...

133
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:28,307
The underground parking lot
is blocked, too.

134
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,111
We have to go up!

135
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,609
Does anyone live on the seventh floor?

136
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:40,441
Me.

137
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:44,695
Hey, we can go up together.

138
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,082
Wait a minute.

139
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:48,448
If you're going up, we should all go up.
Don't you agree?

140
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,076
Let us all go.

141
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:52,042
- All right.
- No.

142
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:55,002
Wait. We need to block the entrance first.

143
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,384
Let's wait and see...

144
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,960
You can block, or wait.
Do whatever you want.

145
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,712
I'm going up.

146
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,758
- Wait.
- You can't.

147
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:06,512
You punks!
Where do you think you're running away to?

148
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,425
You selfish cowards trying
to save yourselves.

149
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,305
You're just worried about your shop.

150
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,055
I can't believe you just said that.

151
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,355
Byeong-il. Come here.

152
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,359
Do you all want to get killed?

153
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,985
Come here. Now!

154
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:23,403
He's right.

155
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:26,027
If we open the entrance,
we'll all be dead.

156
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,620
Move aside. Now.

157
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,457
You don't know what's out there.

158
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,079
I won't move aside!

159
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,785
- Come on.
- Why are you doing this?

160
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,586
- Stop.
- Don't do this.

161
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,049
- Come on.
- Stop.

162
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:42,417
What's that?

163
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,432
- What's that noise?
- What's that?

164
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,770
- What is that?
- Move back.

165
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,515
Jeez.

166
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:07,914
What are you looking at?

167
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,673
Is that a bite mark?

168
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,879
Stop right there!

169
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,340
Byeong-il.

170
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,958
Check him. Go and check him.

171
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:31,389
It's a bite. He's been bit!

172
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:33,682
Oh, goodness.

173
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,775
I got him!

174
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,240
You saw me, right?

175
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,794
Look at the bite mark on his shoulder.

176
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,081
I got him.

177
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,210
Bastard.

178
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,344
Zombie bastard.

179
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,884
It's all okay. It's fine.

180
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:54,968
8 HOURS LATER

181
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:10,197
It's not a disease.

182
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,359
It's a curse.

183
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,244
CRUCRU

184
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,535
IT'S NOT A DISEASE. IT'S A CURSE.

185
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:23,674
They complained of frequent nosebleeds...

186
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:24,921
...and auditory hallucinations.

187
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:27,207
The cause could not be determined.

188
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,466
They weren't from here originally.

189
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:33,471
They came here
because they showed symptoms.

190
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,263
They turned into miserable,
desperate beings.

191
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,097
Every prediction was wrong.

192
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,813
It suddenly begins one day

193
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:42,193
and it never stops.

194
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,807
I was consumed by it, too.

195
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,437
Humans will not be able to overcome this.

196
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,944
If you have symptoms,
kill yourself before it's too late

197
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,027
because being alive will harm others.

198
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,242
But if you decide to live to the end,

199
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,373
there's something you must know.

200
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,530
- That is...
- That is...

201
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,543
THERE IS NO INTERNET CONNECTION

202
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,253
REFRESH

203
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,133
Nothing's working.

204
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:24,773
Will it still be there?

205
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,436
RAMYEON

206
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:42,292
There's probably no one out there, right?

207
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,477
I can't see.

208
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:27,666
I can't see.

209
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:39,891
I can't see.

210
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:02,411
I heard you.

211
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:20,429
I...

212
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,969
can't see.

213
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:49,455
I can't see.

214
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,119
I can't...

215
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:56,667
We have to kill him.

216
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,927
Kill him?

217
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,006
Yes, of course.

218
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,716
Can you do it?

219
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:09,727
Me?

220
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,230
You're the leader.

221
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,145
- I am.
- Yes.

222
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,482
He's still human, though.

223
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,107
Come on.

224
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:21,824
Seung-wan, have you ever seen a movie?

225
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:24,025
If you let the one who got bit live,
then everyone dies.

226
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:25,906
It's okay because it's self-defense.

227
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:28,334
Right, Seok-hyeon?

228
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,464
Won't he die of starvation
if we just leave him?

229
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:37,714
What if he gets hungry and eats everyone?

230
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,046
- We should do something.
- "We should do something."

231
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,302
Knock it off.

232
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,009
Seok-hyeon, you go in.

233
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:45,925
What?

234
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,347
Yes.

235
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:18,646
- Jae-heon, someone is in there.
- Three...

236
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:20,821
two, one...

237
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:23,648
Two...

238
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,397
- Do you think it's a person?
- One...

239
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:27,658
It's a person.

240
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:29,873
They're telling us the pass code.

241
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:35,207
Two, one, three, two...

242
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,623
Thank you.

243
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,495
I thought I was going to die.

244
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,251
- What happened...
- A burglar

245
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:25,839
came in.

246
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,969
How long have you been like this?

247
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,305
It's been a few days.

248
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,937
Did something happen outside?

249
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:45,282
I heard strange noises.

250
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,283
You should see for yourself.

251
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:55,656
Okay.

252
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:07,094
Wait.

253
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,027
I thought I better carry something, too.

254
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:38,789
Let's live together in one place
until the rescue squad comes.

255
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,541
It's safe to be together.

256
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,748
Where will all of us go?

257
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:44,042
The daycare center.

258
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,706
It's relatively safe
because it's far from the entrance.

259
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:49,967
It will also be better

260
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:52,432
to sleep there than here.

261
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:54,256
I won't allow it.

262
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:57,724
- No.
- Who are you to say no?

263
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,016
She's director of the daycare.

264
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:00,519
Scumbags.

265
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,061
Pieces of shit!

266
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,654
You ignored me when I begged.
You're shameless!

267
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:09,899
Your daughter probably
needs someone's help, too.

268
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:24,714
That's why I'm saying I'll go. Let me go.

269
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:27,211
You can do whatever you want
after I leave.

270
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,674
What about you?

271
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:29,923
Are you okay with dying?

272
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,680
Do you have a plan?

273
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,468
There's no internet or phone service.

274
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,102
How can you be sure where she is?

275
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:40,718
- Still...
- First, you have to live.

276
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:45,438
Otherwise you won't be able to find
or see your daughter.

277
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:54,066
Please calm down

278
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,316
and help us.

279
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:59,202
I'll be sure to help you later.

280
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,079
Do whatever you want.

281
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,457
This door is open.

282
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,350
I don't think you should see this.

283
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:43,539
NOW IT'S YOURS

284
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:49,714
Did he kill himself
because the world is doomed?

285
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,303
No, he's been dead for over a week.

286
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,510
How do you know?

287
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,048
It just seems like that, no?

288
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:17,611
AUGUST 25, TUESDAY
SUICIDE

289
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,066
Should I just kill myself now?

290
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,914
At least then

291
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:27,957
I'd die a human.

292
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:53,732
Dad, don't go. It's too dangerous.

293
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:54,855
Don't cry, Su-yeong.

294
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:58,191
Take good care of Yeong-su while I'm away.

295
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,108
All right?

296
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,867
- Dad.
- Don't cry, Su-yeong.

297
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:05,029
Monsters might come if they hear us.

298
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,871
You know
I was in the special forces, right?

299
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:12,577
I'll come back with food.
Yeong-su, listen to your sister, okay?

300
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,042
Get out of there.

301
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,173
Get out of there!

302
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,931
- Dad!
- Dad!

303
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:25,597
Dad!

304
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:27,852
- Dad!
- Dad!

305
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:28,982
Dad!

306
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:33,936
Go away!

307
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,692
Go away, monster!

308
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:41,148
Go away!

309
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,356
Help us!

310
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:46,743
Help us!

311
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:49,203
Help us!

312
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,577
Please help us!

313
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,263
I...

314
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:39,609
THEY MIGHT COME IF THEY HEAR ANYTHING

315
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:44,611
THOSE THINGS DON'T DIE

316
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:57,794
Dad!

317
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,714
- Dad!
- Dad!

318
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:06,801
- Dad!
- Dad!

319
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:08,053
Dad!

320
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:13,394
DO YOU WANT TO SAVE THE KIDS?

321
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,597
DO YOU WANT TO SAVE THE KIDS?

322
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,704
IF YOU MAKE A CALL AND LEAVE THE PHONE ON

323
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,536
IT'LL MAKE A NOISE
WHEN A MONSTER IS NEAR YOU

324
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:40,705
EMERGENCY

325
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:46,171
COME WHEN YOUR MIND IS MADE UP

326
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,409
I think

327
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,080
I better stay home.

328
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:23,544
I think you should come with us.

329
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,010
No.

330
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,676
I don't want to burden you anymore.

331
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,585
I'll find my own way to survive.

332
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,350
- Still...
- Okay.

333
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,179
Take care of yourself.

334
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,987
Everyone has their own way of living.

335
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,201
I'll be fine.

336
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,120
Of course, I'll be fine.

337
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:04,959
What's wrong with him?

338
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,133
Salute!

339
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:10,167
We met in the elevator last time.

340
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,050
Right. I'm Lee Su-ung.

341
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,005
You live in Room 1305.

342
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:17,763
And you're in Room 308.

343
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,980
I live in Room 1009. I'm Son Hye-in.

344
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:23,937
Nice to meet you.

345
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:25,649
I'm Ryu Jae-hwan.

346
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,442
Does anyone have sunscreen?

347
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:28,864
What?

348
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,901
- I'll look for it.
- Okay.

349
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,355
You don't have to look for it.

350
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,155
Anyway, I'm No Byeong-il.

351
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,868
We're neighbors, but we've never...

352
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,158
Wait a minute.

353
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:39,699
You're not a familiar face.

354
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:41,658
Right.

355
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:44,332
She doesn't really talk.

356
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,875
Oh, I see.

357
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:48,173
You seem to know everything, ma'am.

358
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:51,962
Don't call me, "ma'am."
I'm sure I'm much younger than you.

359
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:54,378
Pardon? What makes you so sure?

360
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:56,304
Where is he?

361
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:58,135
- Oh my God.
- Where is he?

362
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,350
- Where is he?
- Who?

363
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,851
- Seok-hyeon, who are you looking for?
- That thug!

364
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,064
That thug did this to me!

365
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:07,402
Son of a bitch.

366
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,554
You go your way.

367
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:35,972
I'll go mine.

368
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,306
How do you feel?

369
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:46,141
Do you feel like biting into people
and tearing them apart?

370
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:48,807
Which floor are you going to?

371
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:52,442
It's okay between us. We killed together.

372
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:54,988
Shut the hell up or go downstairs.

373
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:00,905
I don't want to.

374
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:05,657
It'd be freaking embarrassing
if I changed into something like that.

375
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,209
I'll kill you if you change.

376
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,455
Likewise.

377
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,884
I think this works for you.

378
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,183
Walk carefully.

379
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,999
I'm Han Du-sik.

380
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:49,713
And you are?

381
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,339
I'm Cha Hyun-su.

382
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:55,757
A slow speaker.

383
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,764
How

384
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,433
can I save the kids?

385
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:02,509
What do you mean by how?
You'll have to go.

386
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:12,861
Should I go?

387
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,450
I used to be a legend in Cheonggyecheon.

388
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,872
You know how you can get a tank made there

389
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,157
if you have a blueprint?

390
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:40,927
That means I can transform your stick
into something more useful.

391
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,011
- Give me that.
- Pardon?

392
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:49,596
Give me that stick.

393
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,098
Oh, the weapon.

394
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,091
Honey.

395
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,101
You didn't even notice I was gone.

396
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,349
Bring the eggs. Now!

397
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,110
Stupid bitch.

398
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,610
Jeez.

399
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,362
SUPERMARKET

400
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:44,486
Bite him.

401
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:46,870
Bite him hard.

402
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:56,419
It's done.

403
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:00,045
Hey.

404
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,338
CERTIFICATE OF MERIT
FIRST LIEUTENANT HAN DU-SIK

405
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,308
They still move around
with their heads chopped off.

406
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:15,563
A kitchen knife won't work.

407
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,055
But this will do.

408
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:21,229
Can I kill them with that?

409
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:24,611
No, you can't.

410
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,066
How do you know?

411
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,754
I just do. Avoid them at all costs.

412
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:35,537
If you come across them,
run for your life.

413
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:36,463
No.

414
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,463
Don't get caught in the first place.

415
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:46,511
Then please lend me that canon.

416
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,465
No.

417
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,760
It isn't stable,
so it can fire only a few shots.

418
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:54,727
I fired earlier.
I'll fire again if it breaks in.

419
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:58,313
The last shot is for me.

420
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,648
So I can go easy.

421
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,460
I can't see.

422
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:38,535
I found you.

423
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,094
Don't run...

424
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,610
Where are you?

425
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:08,229
Man, everything's melting already.

426
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,605
They'll all go to waste.

427
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:25,409
Hey, can't you see they're all going bad?

428
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:28,456
The power went out.
What do you want me to do?

429
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,883
How dare you talk back to me?

430
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,260
Well...

431
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,217
Can you be in the management office?

432
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,470
I need to check the electrical room.

433
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:46,386
I saw some places with lights on outside.

434
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,885
A blackout would affect
the whole district.

435
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,152
Only this building is experiencing issues.

436
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,529
I'll find out when
I go to the electrical room.

437
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:58,777
That's all the food we have,
so we have to hurry.

438
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:02,322
What? Hey, do you think this is all yours?

439
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:05,865
Don't be ridiculous.

440
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:08,003
We'll have nothing
if everything melts, anyway.

441
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,580
- Why don't we hand out...
- Be quiet!

442
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:12,247
I'll go.

443
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:16,455
Hey!

444
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:17,587
What are you doing?

445
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:19,130
Hey!

446
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:21,143
What are you doing?

447
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,968
You're stealing!

448
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,813
It's an emergency.

449
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:28,638
Hey!

450
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:32,272
Hey! Why you...

451
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:36,321
I can't believe the way these
punks are treating me, goddamn it.

452
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,691
Damn it.

453
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:44,073
This is all because you look down on me,
you bitch.

454
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:50,711
It was charging.

455
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:52,499
I don't know how long it'll last.

456
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:56,626
One more thing.

457
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:58,713
Be careful.

458
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,523
What do you do in this situation?

459
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,436
Isn't there a firefighters' manual?

460
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,399
We have to calm people down
and make them act collectively.

461
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,527
Food and drinking water must be secured.

462
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,454
And an escape route, as well.

463
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:26,702
Most importantly,

464
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:29,453
we need to understand the situation.

465
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:30,906
What about the cameras?

466
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:38,125
They can only help so much,
since there's only a few of them.

467
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:42,260
- There must be recordings.
- We need a password.

468
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,007
The security guard must know it.

469
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:48,215
The building was blockaded...

470
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,352
Not to lock us in,

471
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,560
but to protect us?

472
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,163
Hey.

473
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:09,079
You shouldn't go there.

474
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:13,207
Why not?

475
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:15,828
My dog's been barking like this.

476
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,503
I'll be careful.

477
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:20,087
What?

478
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:25,053
What's wrong? Are you scared?

479
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:27,141
Is something there?

480
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:29,103
Okay.

481
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:32,637
Su-yeong.

482
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:34,814
I'm scared.

483
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:38,268
Su-yeong.

484
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:39,975
It's too dark in here.

485
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,647
It's okay.

486
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:44,395
We'll be fine.

487
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,355
Dad.

488
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:49,528
He'll be back soon.

489
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:09,759
Kids. I'm here to help you.

490
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:16,941
Sir.

491
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:20,362
Please save our dad.

492
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:22,321
What?

493
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,570
Dad

494
00:48:25,777 --> 00:48:27,947
fell down.

495
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:32,241
I know.

496
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:34,488
Maybe he's still...

497
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,208
Nobody can survive a fall
from the 12th floor.

498
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:55,724
There's a man on the 14th floor
with a lot of food.

499
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:00,055
You're hungry, aren't you?

500
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:06,608
You won't stay here by yourselves,
will you?

501
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:16,042
We need to go into the hall
where monsters are running wild.

502
00:49:16,745 --> 00:49:18,035
Are you ready?

503
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:23,840
How old are you guys?

504
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:29,422
I'm nine years old and my brother is six.

505
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:37,515
Those are perfect ages to fight monsters.

506
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,201
Don't worry.

507
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:55,028
I'll protect you.

508
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:12,843
FIRE HYDRANT

509
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:07,271
Protect them?

510
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:12,324
Is that what you want?

511
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:24,405
Are you okay?

512
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:27,035
Get away from me.

513
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:29,748
Go!

514
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:39,508
Yes, you always liked to act cool
in front of the weak.

515
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:41,056
And then what happened?

516
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:44,814
It was my fault.

517
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:45,983
CHA HYUN-SU

518
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:50,066
Come out!

519
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,401
- It was my fault.
- It wasn't your fault.

520
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:54,945
Bastard!

521
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:56,698
It was your fault!

522
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:01,832
You're a sad case.

523
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:04,413
It was unfair.

524
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:09,416
Die.

525
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:20,551
Yes.

526
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:23,183
It was unfair.

527
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:40,203
