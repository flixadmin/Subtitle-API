1
00:00:00,634 --> 00:00:02,701
Previously, on "Arrow..."

2
00:00:02,703 --> 00:00:06,145
But there are some things that must
never be spoken of.

3
00:00:06,146 --> 00:00:09,780
How could you not tell me
Malcolm Merlyn was my father?!

4
00:00:09,782 --> 00:00:11,849
Sara, you're not a killer!

5
00:00:11,851 --> 00:00:13,451
I am what I need to be.

6
00:00:13,453 --> 00:00:15,753
Roy, you're
dangerous.

7
00:00:15,755 --> 00:00:17,889
Some people
are just broken, man.

8
00:00:17,891 --> 00:00:20,158
I am not letting what happened
to Slade happen to Roy.

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,026
Is that what
I think it is?

10
00:00:22,028 --> 00:00:24,962
Mirakuru. We're going
to use it to make a cure.

11
00:00:28,467 --> 00:00:30,268
No change?

12
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,736
Nope.

13
00:00:31,738 --> 00:00:34,605
So much blood mixed in
with so much Mirakuru,

14
00:00:34,607 --> 00:00:36,807
I don't know
if it's good or bad.

15
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:38,743
We could really
use that cure.

16
00:00:38,745 --> 00:00:40,511
I talked to Caitlin
this morning.

17
00:00:40,513 --> 00:00:42,680
They're
working on it.

18
00:00:42,682 --> 00:00:44,148
No mention on
Isabel Rochev's death?

19
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,083
Not a thing.
I wasn't expecting

20
00:00:46,085 --> 00:00:48,719
a glowing obituary,
but she's a Fortune 500

21
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:50,221
CEO that's been missing
for a week now.

22
00:00:50,223 --> 00:00:52,356
You'd think she'd have
some column inches.

23
00:00:58,263 --> 00:01:00,932
Does the fact that him lying
there freaks me out a little

24
00:01:00,934 --> 00:01:02,700
make me a bad person?

25
00:01:02,702 --> 00:01:04,368
Felicity, I don't think there's
a force on earth

26
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:07,071
that can make you a bad person.
But I am starving.

27
00:01:07,073 --> 00:01:08,739
Dinner?

28
00:01:08,741 --> 00:01:10,274
Yeah.

29
00:01:10,276 --> 00:01:12,410
No Big Belly burger, though.

30
00:01:12,412 --> 00:01:13,911
It's giving me a Big Belly.

31
00:01:13,913 --> 00:01:15,947
Sushi, then.

32
00:01:15,949 --> 00:01:18,516
Sushi, then.

33
00:01:20,919 --> 00:01:25,489
How can you be unconscious
and freak me out at the same...

34
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:30,127
Time?

35
00:01:30,129 --> 00:01:32,897
Roy?

36
00:01:34,566 --> 00:01:38,302
Oh, my God!

37
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,137
Oh, you scared me.

38
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,808
Roy?

39
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,744
Forgot my phone.

40
00:01:52,985 --> 00:01:54,452
Roy, listen--

41
00:01:54,454 --> 00:01:56,988
Dig!

42
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,756
You ok?
Go!

43
00:01:58,758 --> 00:02:00,758
Roy!

44
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,360
Roy!

45
00:02:02,362 --> 00:02:03,761
What's going on?

46
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:16,507
Move, move, move, move,
move, move, move, move!

47
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:17,942
Move, move!

You think Roy's ok?

52
00:02:42,235 --> 00:02:47,171
Please tell me that you're not thinking
about Roy right now.

53
00:02:47,173 --> 00:02:50,274
We're finally alone, in bed,

54
00:02:50,276 --> 00:02:52,743
in a very nice hotel room.

55
00:02:52,745 --> 00:02:56,447
A hotel room that
you couldn't afford.

56
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:58,983
I have something
of a history with the manager.

57
00:02:58,985 --> 00:03:01,952
Mmm. I can
only imagine.

58
00:03:04,255 --> 00:03:07,591
I think I trashed
this specific room once.

59
00:03:07,593 --> 00:03:09,927
But favors run out.

60
00:03:09,929 --> 00:03:13,664
We should think about
getting a more permanent place.

61
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:20,804
We?

62
00:03:20,806 --> 00:03:23,574
Well, you're probably getting
tired of staying with Laurel,

63
00:03:23,576 --> 00:03:28,812
and we can't sleep in the foundry now
that Roy's there, so...

64
00:03:28,814 --> 00:03:31,715
But, I mean, "we,"

65
00:03:31,717 --> 00:03:33,684
now you're asking me
to move in with you?

66
00:03:38,658 --> 00:03:41,692
Hey, your phone's
ringing.

67
00:03:41,694 --> 00:03:43,227
I know.

68
00:03:45,998 --> 00:03:48,198
Okay, both our
phones are ringing,

69
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,501
that's never good.

70
00:03:57,175 --> 00:03:59,777
What happened?

71
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:01,645
I don't know.
One minute he's comatose,

72
00:04:01,647 --> 00:04:03,580
the next, he's flipping over
computer equipment.

73
00:04:03,582 --> 00:04:05,983
He was a lot more out of control than
Slade was at your house.

74
00:04:05,985 --> 00:04:08,285
He looked like Roy,
but he...wasn't Roy.

75
00:04:08,287 --> 00:04:09,585
Where do you think he's headed?

76
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,522
I don't know,

77
00:04:10,523 --> 00:04:12,322
but we have to find him.

78
00:04:14,526 --> 00:04:16,393
Despite everyone's
predictions,

79
00:04:16,395 --> 00:04:19,363
you've managed to pull ahead
of Sebastian Blood in recent polls.

80
00:04:19,365 --> 00:04:22,933
Yes. I think our message
is resonating with the voters.

81
00:04:22,935 --> 00:04:26,203
The people of Starling know
that I have a vision,

82
00:04:26,205 --> 00:04:29,506
and the experienced apparatus to make
that vision a reality.

83
00:04:29,508 --> 00:04:31,141
What would you say
is the main reason

84
00:04:31,143 --> 00:04:33,510
they should vote for you
over alderman Blood?

85
00:04:33,512 --> 00:04:35,446
Well, um...

86
00:04:35,448 --> 00:04:38,816
Alderman Blood
isn't a parent.

87
00:04:38,818 --> 00:04:42,019
And the soul
of being a parent

88
00:04:42,021 --> 00:04:44,588
is making sure that
your children have a bright future.

89
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,391
And I've been very lucky to be able
to do that for my own.

90
00:04:47,393 --> 00:04:49,793
Yeah.
Mother of the year.

91
00:04:49,795 --> 00:04:52,229
Uh, we're in the middle
of an interview.

92
00:04:52,231 --> 00:04:54,031
Oh, I'll keep it short.

93
00:04:54,033 --> 00:04:56,433
You can't have
your rally at verdant.

94
00:04:56,435 --> 00:04:58,669
It's the only place I have that hasn't
been poisoned by you.

95
00:04:58,671 --> 00:05:01,305
Can you give me
one moment, please?

96
00:05:01,307 --> 00:05:02,673
Turn it off.

97
00:05:02,675 --> 00:05:04,475
Thea, I know you're upset,

98
00:05:04,477 --> 00:05:06,877
and you have every right to be,
but we need to talk somewhere else.

99
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:09,713
I'm done talking.
I just came by to tell you,

100
00:05:09,715 --> 00:05:12,616
it'll be a cold day in hell before
you can use my club.

101
00:05:12,618 --> 00:05:14,952
We can't just change
the venue the day before.

102
00:05:14,954 --> 00:05:16,587
I'm sure you can
figure something else.

103
00:05:16,589 --> 00:05:19,056
I mean, you have such
an experienced apparatus.

104
00:05:19,058 --> 00:05:20,791
You signed a contract.

105
00:05:20,793 --> 00:05:22,793
Huh.

106
00:05:22,795 --> 00:05:26,597
Just when I thought
you couldn't go any lower...

107
00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:29,299
You threaten
your own daughter.

108
00:05:36,407 --> 00:05:39,676
Moira.

109
00:05:39,678 --> 00:05:41,945
What's going on?

110
00:05:41,947 --> 00:05:44,615
Sorry you had to witness that.

111
00:05:44,617 --> 00:05:47,184
After her abduction, I'd think that
the two of you would be closer than ever.

112
00:05:47,186 --> 00:05:49,686
It's a very
complicated situation.

113
00:05:49,688 --> 00:05:52,356
Well, my advice?

114
00:05:52,358 --> 00:05:54,024
Simplify it.

115
00:05:54,026 --> 00:05:57,661
You have to be
either a mother or a candidate.

116
00:05:57,663 --> 00:05:58,929
You can't be both.

117
00:05:58,931 --> 00:06:02,533
Not right now.
You cannot split your focus.

118
00:06:04,169 --> 00:06:06,670
You're absolutely right.

119
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:11,441
You're really cute
when you're mopey.

120
00:06:11,443 --> 00:06:15,679
I'm not mopey.

121
00:06:15,681 --> 00:06:18,549
Mopey's your default, Ollie.

122
00:06:18,551 --> 00:06:21,385
It's part of
your smoldering charm.

123
00:06:21,387 --> 00:06:24,621
I do have
smoldering charm.

124
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:30,127
But you're more
than usual mopey.

125
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:33,130
Is everything all right?

126
00:06:38,203 --> 00:06:40,838
It's fine.

127
00:06:43,141 --> 00:06:45,509
Ollie.

128
00:06:45,511 --> 00:06:47,845
Tommy had me out
a little bit later

129
00:06:47,847 --> 00:06:49,680
than maybe I should have been,

130
00:06:49,682 --> 00:06:51,982
and...

131
00:06:51,984 --> 00:06:54,284
I'm wiped.

132
00:06:54,286 --> 00:06:56,520
Well, you want me to go?

133
00:06:56,522 --> 00:06:59,323
I promised Sara I'd help her
with her trigonometry.

134
00:06:59,325 --> 00:07:01,291
I don't know what that is.

135
00:07:01,293 --> 00:07:03,861
You are very cute.

136
00:07:06,731 --> 00:07:08,999
Get some sleep.

137
00:07:09,001 --> 00:07:11,301
Mm-hmm.

138
00:07:12,503 --> 00:07:14,304
Bye.

139
00:07:14,306 --> 00:07:16,206
Bye.

140
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,008
Good night,
Mrs. Queen.

141
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,676
Good night.

142
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:27,751
You didn't go
out with Tommy last night.

143
00:07:27,753 --> 00:07:29,853
Hey.

144
00:07:29,855 --> 00:07:33,423
Thanks for eavesdropping
on my entire conversation, Mom.

145
00:07:33,425 --> 00:07:34,791
That's--that's nice.

146
00:07:34,793 --> 00:07:36,660
Sweetheart,
something's bothering you,

147
00:07:36,662 --> 00:07:38,896
tell me what it is.

148
00:07:40,965 --> 00:07:42,699
Dad's going to kill me.

149
00:07:42,701 --> 00:07:45,569
Your father
loves you.

150
00:07:45,571 --> 00:07:46,640
I love you.

151
00:07:46,665 --> 00:07:47,868
I screwed up.

152
00:07:50,275 --> 00:07:52,042
It's bad.

153
00:07:53,344 --> 00:07:55,612
What happened?

154
00:07:57,782 --> 00:08:01,485
I got a girl pregnant.

155
00:08:01,487 --> 00:08:05,756
Laurel's pregnant?

156
00:08:05,758 --> 00:08:08,558
No.

157
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,162
Not Laurel.

158
00:08:20,071 --> 00:08:21,571
This is ridiculous.

159
00:08:21,573 --> 00:08:23,340
We can't just ride
around all night

160
00:08:23,342 --> 00:08:25,208
hoping to lay eyes
on him.

161
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,945
- Diggle?
- His place is clean.

162
00:08:27,947 --> 00:08:30,047
I don't think
he's been back here.

163
00:08:30,049 --> 00:08:31,748
Call just went out for an ambulance
at 14th and Hobart.

164
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,017
There's four men
seriously assaulted...

165
00:08:34,019 --> 00:08:36,153
By someone wearing
a red hoodie.

166
00:08:47,231 --> 00:08:49,700
What happened?

167
00:08:49,702 --> 00:08:52,202
Guy jumped us.
Came out of nowhere.

168
00:08:52,204 --> 00:08:55,238
The dude is 'roided out
or something.

169
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,641
Crazy like.

170
00:08:57,643 --> 00:09:00,477
See ya, Sin.

171
00:09:00,479 --> 00:09:03,947
Adios. Yo, Abercrombie.

172
00:09:03,949 --> 00:09:07,784
Hold up.
Where you been, man?

173
00:09:07,786 --> 00:09:09,090
I went over to 
your place like 20 times.

174
00:09:09,115 --> 00:09:10,514
Thea said you skipped town.

175
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,492
Holy crap.

176
00:09:15,494 --> 00:09:17,928
Have you been
in a fight?

177
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:22,632
Hey, Sin, is this guy
bothering you?

178
00:09:22,634 --> 00:09:24,935
No, no, no, he's chill.
Seriously, just step off.

179
00:09:24,937 --> 00:09:26,602
We going to have a problem, guy?

180
00:09:26,627 --> 00:09:27,472
Seriously?

181
00:09:27,473 --> 00:09:29,439
Just leave him
alone, he's fine.

182
00:09:29,441 --> 00:09:31,441
Oh, what, you got
nothing smart to say?

183
00:09:53,933 --> 00:09:55,197
Felicity's running
facial recognition

184
00:09:55,198 --> 00:09:56,764
on traffic cameras
throughout the city.

185
00:09:56,766 --> 00:09:58,466
Which could take forever.
We need to take Roy down now

186
00:09:58,468 --> 00:10:00,234
before he attacks
any more people.

187
00:10:00,236 --> 00:10:01,735
What part of "I want
nothing to do with you"

188
00:10:01,737 --> 00:10:03,103
are just not understanding?

189
00:10:03,105 --> 00:10:06,240
I came by to see Sara.

190
00:10:06,242 --> 00:10:07,775
And what about him?

191
00:10:07,777 --> 00:10:09,306
He's been
stalking me.

192
00:10:09,307 --> 00:10:10,129
He's protecting you.

193
00:10:10,154 --> 00:10:11,146
From what?

194
00:10:11,147 --> 00:10:12,480
Slade Wilson is still at large.

195
00:10:12,482 --> 00:10:14,281
He already tried
hurting you once.

196
00:10:14,283 --> 00:10:16,183
He didn't hurt me.

197
00:10:16,185 --> 00:10:18,385
He told me the truth, which
I know you think is a bad thing,

198
00:10:18,387 --> 00:10:19,886
but it's actually not.

199
00:10:19,911 --> 00:10:21,223
It is if it costs me you.

200
00:10:21,224 --> 00:10:23,757
Your lies did that.

201
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:26,026
Now, I'm going to go upstairs
to the stock room,

202
00:10:26,028 --> 00:10:28,028
and if I get attacked by some
shot glasses,

203
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:29,964
I'll call 911.

204
00:10:32,234 --> 00:10:34,969
Thanks for taking
care of her.

205
00:10:34,971 --> 00:10:37,805
Lucky for me, she's not as good
at disappearing as you were.

206
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,744
I'll be right back.

207
00:10:43,746 --> 00:10:45,880
Have you seen Thea?

208
00:10:45,882 --> 00:10:47,448
What happened
to your eye?

209
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,083
It's ok. I could
cover it with make-up.

210
00:10:49,085 --> 00:10:51,018
If I work make-up.

211
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:51,856
It's fine.

212
00:10:51,881 --> 00:10:53,455
Who did this to you?

213
00:10:53,456 --> 00:10:54,409
It's a long story.

214
00:10:54,434 --> 00:10:55,323
I asked you who.

215
00:10:55,324 --> 00:10:57,424
Roy.

216
00:10:57,426 --> 00:10:59,960
But he's not right
in the head.

217
00:10:59,962 --> 00:11:01,729
He got injected
with something.

218
00:11:01,731 --> 00:11:03,931
A drug, I don't know,
but it made him strong.

219
00:11:03,933 --> 00:11:05,833
Like, comic book strong.

220
00:11:05,835 --> 00:11:07,535
Look, I know it sounds nuts--

221
00:11:07,537 --> 00:11:09,436
it really doesn't.

222
00:11:09,438 --> 00:11:11,238
Sara, Roy's a friend.

223
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,374
He needs help,
not a beat down.

224
00:11:18,013 --> 00:11:21,916
I'll have
to call you right back.

225
00:11:21,918 --> 00:11:24,351
Do you want me
to stay, Mr. Blood?

226
00:11:24,353 --> 00:11:26,654
Uh, no, no, thank you.

227
00:11:26,656 --> 00:11:28,589
I'll be fine.

228
00:11:29,858 --> 00:11:32,493
My new body man.

229
00:11:32,495 --> 00:11:33,928
He's a little over-protective.

230
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:34,895
Hmm.

231
00:11:34,897 --> 00:11:36,597
Please.
No, thank you.

232
00:11:36,599 --> 00:11:38,866
I'd say this visit
is unexpected,

233
00:11:38,868 --> 00:11:41,135
but I despise understatements.

234
00:11:41,137 --> 00:11:42,369
I'm dropping out
of the race.

235
00:11:42,371 --> 00:11:43,804
I'm making
a concession speech

236
00:11:43,806 --> 00:11:45,706
at my rally tonight.

237
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,908
You're ahead
in the latest polls.

238
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:50,644
Even the most skeptical pundits are saying
you could actually pull this out.

239
00:11:50,646 --> 00:11:53,647
I felt I owed you the courtesy of
informing you in person.

240
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:57,718
I don't, however, owe you
an explanation as well.

241
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,321
No, you don't.

242
00:12:00,323 --> 00:12:02,957
But I'd appreciate one.

243
00:12:04,593 --> 00:12:06,293
What you're doing, Moira,

244
00:12:06,295 --> 00:12:08,729
as much as it benefits me,

245
00:12:08,731 --> 00:12:11,231
doesn't really make much sense.

246
00:12:15,403 --> 00:12:18,072
It's my daughter.

247
00:12:18,074 --> 00:12:21,575
At the moment, she needs me
more than Starling does.

248
00:12:21,577 --> 00:12:24,912
Well, you're doing
the right thing.

249
00:12:24,914 --> 00:12:29,216
I'm going to change
this city, Moira.

250
00:12:29,218 --> 00:12:31,852
A new day is coming.

251
00:12:31,854 --> 00:12:33,187
A better day.

252
00:12:33,189 --> 00:12:35,055
For all of us.

253
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:39,326
I know things seem
bleak, sweetheart,

254
00:12:39,328 --> 00:12:41,528
but we're going
to figure this out, I promise.

255
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,664
Mom, does it seem fair?

256
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:45,666
To make...

257
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:51,205
One mistake, and it...

258
00:12:51,207 --> 00:12:54,174
Feels like
my entire life is over.

259
00:12:54,176 --> 00:12:58,178
Oh, your life
is far from over.

260
00:12:59,881 --> 00:13:03,017
Are you sure
it's yours?

261
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:07,221
Where there is
money, Oliver,

262
00:13:07,223 --> 00:13:09,790
there are people
looking to take advantage.

263
00:13:09,792 --> 00:13:12,326
She's not that type of person.
She's a good person, Mom.

264
00:13:12,328 --> 00:13:13,761
She's...

265
00:13:13,763 --> 00:13:16,030
All right.

266
00:13:16,032 --> 00:13:18,599
I don't know what to do.
What do I do?

267
00:13:22,537 --> 00:13:26,140
We all make mistakes,
Oliver. And I had hoped

268
00:13:26,142 --> 00:13:30,911
that one day you'd forgive me for any
that I might make, so...

269
00:13:30,913 --> 00:13:35,315
All right, um,
I'll be right back.

270
00:13:37,752 --> 00:13:39,920
Verdant, 14th and Hobart,

271
00:13:39,922 --> 00:13:41,955
and the bar Sin
spotted him at.

272
00:13:41,957 --> 00:13:44,224
He looks to be moving east.
What's east?

273
00:13:44,226 --> 00:13:46,026
Queen mansion.

274
00:13:46,028 --> 00:13:47,693
If he still remembers
where Thea lives--

275
00:13:47,718 --> 00:13:48,697
well, used to live,

276
00:13:48,698 --> 00:13:50,397
but Roy doesn't
know that...

277
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,766
There might be something
in Roy still left in there.

278
00:13:52,768 --> 00:13:55,102
Or it's just a coincidence
that he's moving east.

279
00:13:55,104 --> 00:13:57,204
Ahem. I know
that Sin's involved,

280
00:13:57,206 --> 00:13:59,106
but don't let that
cloud your judgment.

281
00:13:59,108 --> 00:14:02,142
Well, don't let the fact that
this used to be Roy cloud yours.

282
00:14:06,481 --> 00:14:07,614
Sin.

283
00:14:07,616 --> 00:14:09,116
I found Roy.

284
00:14:09,118 --> 00:14:10,918
Well, I thought I
told you to go home.

285
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,653
Yeah, that's where I am
right now.

286
00:14:12,655 --> 00:14:16,356
And so is he.

287
00:14:23,064 --> 00:14:25,966
Roy!

288
00:14:38,213 --> 00:14:39,646
He's not here.

289
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,838
It's Oliver.

290
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,508
It's me.

291
00:15:07,510 --> 00:15:09,476
What you're doing right now,

292
00:15:09,478 --> 00:15:11,945
it's because of the Mirakuru.

293
00:15:11,947 --> 00:15:14,615
You're a good person, Roy.
You have a conscience

294
00:15:14,617 --> 00:15:16,950
and a soul.
I need you to use those

295
00:15:16,952 --> 00:15:20,220
and fight this.
You can do it!

296
00:15:38,073 --> 00:15:40,707
Drop the arrow, drop it!

297
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:47,014
Ahh!

298
00:15:53,122 --> 00:15:54,521
No!

299
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,180
A full moon tonight.

300
00:16:12,205 --> 00:16:14,285
That really brings out
the whack jobs.

301
00:16:14,286 --> 00:16:17,854
Good news is,
it can't get any stranger.

302
00:16:17,856 --> 00:16:19,990
My friend
needs your help.

303
00:16:19,992 --> 00:16:22,559
I was wrong.
Got to call you back.

304
00:16:24,195 --> 00:16:26,396
Some of this damage
is chronic.

305
00:16:26,398 --> 00:16:28,532
The cost of jumping off
rooftops, I guess.

306
00:16:28,534 --> 00:16:31,068
I need to get back on my feet.

307
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:33,203
I can give you a brace,
but you'll still be

308
00:16:33,205 --> 00:16:36,073
in horrendous amounts
of pain. Six months ago,

309
00:16:36,075 --> 00:16:37,708
this cabinet
would have been empty.

310
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:40,407
The Chinese Triad was stopping all
of our med shipments--

311
00:16:40,607 --> 00:16:43,976
until someone stopped them.

312
00:16:43,978 --> 00:16:47,913
Ever since, I've been looking
for a way to thank you.

313
00:16:59,225 --> 00:17:01,893
If you're going to have to
follow me everywhere,

314
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:04,529
at least don't lurk,
all right?

315
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:09,568
I can't let you
out of my sight.

316
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,604
You're sick of seeing me
everywhere you go;

317
00:17:12,606 --> 00:17:14,673
lurking seemed like
a good compromise.

318
00:17:14,675 --> 00:17:17,843
Yeah, well, it's not.

319
00:17:22,382 --> 00:17:24,049
Family's hard.

320
00:17:24,051 --> 00:17:25,684
Sometimes they're the hardest
in the world.

321
00:17:25,686 --> 00:17:28,053
Loving someone so much
and letting them love you back.

322
00:17:28,055 --> 00:17:30,722
You know, you're right...
You should go back to lurking.

323
00:17:30,724 --> 00:17:32,649
I've spent a lot of time
with your family.

324
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,717
If you think that gives you the right
to weigh in, you're wrong.

325
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:37,686
Plus, Oliver will be out of money soon
and you'll be unemployed.

326
00:17:37,688 --> 00:17:39,521
Right.

327
00:17:39,523 --> 00:17:41,957
I guess I should get
this in under the wire.

328
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:44,760
You know, your mother
isn't perfect.

329
00:17:44,762 --> 00:17:46,829
Her judgment
definitely isn't.

330
00:17:46,831 --> 00:17:48,664
But there's one thing she's
consistent about

331
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,532
is that she loves
you and Oliver.

332
00:17:50,534 --> 00:17:52,735
And that should
buy her what in your mind?

333
00:17:52,737 --> 00:17:55,471
Well, I don't know,
Thea...

334
00:17:55,473 --> 00:17:57,873
But she is
your mother.

335
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,975
That should buy
her something.

336
00:17:59,977 --> 00:18:02,411
A second chance,
maybe.

337
00:18:02,413 --> 00:18:04,346
...A citywide man hunt

338
00:18:04,348 --> 00:18:05,681
for the perpetrator of an attack

339
00:18:05,683 --> 00:18:07,850
that left one police officer
seriously injured

340
00:18:07,852 --> 00:18:09,451
and the other dead.

341
00:18:09,453 --> 00:18:12,321
We have video
shot by a bystander,

342
00:18:12,323 --> 00:18:16,291
but please be warned that the footage
may be too graphic for some viewers.

343
00:18:18,428 --> 00:18:19,895
Oh, my God.

344
00:18:19,897 --> 00:18:21,330
Thea...

345
00:18:21,332 --> 00:18:22,665
I have to go
see a friend.

346
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:25,267
If you have
to follow, follow.

347
00:18:25,269 --> 00:18:28,737
These aren't going
to fix your knee.

348
00:18:28,739 --> 00:18:31,006
They'll help it heal faster.
And until then?

349
00:18:32,876 --> 00:18:35,377
Where are we with
facial recognition?

350
00:18:35,379 --> 00:18:37,746
Traffic cams can't
get a clear shot.

351
00:18:37,748 --> 00:18:39,048
Now I see why
you wear that hood.

352
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:41,050
Felicity...
We need to find Roy

353
00:18:41,052 --> 00:18:42,518
before the police do.

354
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,420
Because they'll kill
him and we won't?

355
00:18:45,755 --> 00:18:48,323
S.T.A.R. Labs
is working on a cure.

356
00:18:48,325 --> 00:18:49,892
Which they may
never come up with.

357
00:18:49,894 --> 00:18:51,760
And even if they do,
I mean, how many people

358
00:18:51,762 --> 00:18:53,562
are we going to let Roy
kill in the meantime?

359
00:18:53,564 --> 00:18:54,984
You know, you wanted
to kill Helena, too.

360
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:56,232
You found another way.

361
00:18:56,233 --> 00:18:57,866
That was different,
and you know it.

362
00:18:57,868 --> 00:19:00,402
Roy has the Mirakuru
in him, just like Slade.

363
00:19:00,404 --> 00:19:03,472
And if you had a clear shot of Slade
right now, you would take it.

364
00:19:03,474 --> 00:19:04,907
Roy isn't Slade!

365
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:06,308
Roy isn't Roy.

366
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,342
He's not himself
anymore,

367
00:19:07,344 --> 00:19:09,611
he's too far gone.

368
00:19:09,613 --> 00:19:11,380
I don't believe that.

369
00:19:13,184 --> 00:19:15,584
Do you even hear yourself
right now, Ollie?

370
00:19:15,586 --> 00:19:19,254
This is the exact conversation that
we had five years ago,

371
00:19:19,256 --> 00:19:22,424
except we were
freezing on Lian Yu.

372
00:19:28,998 --> 00:19:31,767
What are you doing?

373
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:33,569
What needs to be done.

374
00:19:33,571 --> 00:19:35,771
The Mirakuru won't do anything
against a head shot.

375
00:19:35,773 --> 00:19:37,372
Sara!

376
00:19:37,374 --> 00:19:38,807
Your mother's rally starts in
a half an hour.

377
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:40,743
I'd start getting dressed
if I were you.

378
00:19:53,556 --> 00:19:57,760
She reminds me so much
of me after I came home.

379
00:19:57,762 --> 00:20:00,996
When it just seemed...

380
00:20:00,998 --> 00:20:04,967
Seemed impossible to believe
in anything even resembling hope.

381
00:20:04,969 --> 00:20:06,769
But you did.

382
00:20:06,771 --> 00:20:08,837
You did.

383
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:12,141
Eventually.

384
00:20:12,143 --> 00:20:14,443
Sara will, too.

385
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:26,321
Oh, thanks for coming.

386
00:20:26,323 --> 00:20:28,757
It's chill.
Who's that?

387
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:30,993
I...my shadow.

388
00:20:30,995 --> 00:20:33,996
Listen, something
is going on with Roy.

389
00:20:33,998 --> 00:20:36,498
I know, I saw him.
He's totally crazed.

390
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:38,167
What's happening to him?

391
00:20:40,436 --> 00:20:43,806
Do you remember around Christmas
when he bailed on us?

392
00:20:43,808 --> 00:20:45,440
Yeah?

393
00:20:45,442 --> 00:20:48,310
He got shot up with something,
this drug,

394
00:20:48,312 --> 00:20:49,978
and it's been messing
with his head.

395
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,314
Did you tell my brother
any of this?

396
00:20:52,316 --> 00:20:54,783
No...Why?

397
00:20:54,785 --> 00:20:56,618
He's got this bodyguard
all over me.

398
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,554
He must know about Roy,

399
00:20:58,556 --> 00:21:00,789
think he's coming
after me or something.

400
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,191
Well, what are you
going to do?

401
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,832
Roy?

402
00:21:09,834 --> 00:21:12,901
Roy, it's me.

403
00:21:12,903 --> 00:21:15,304
It's Thea.

404
00:21:16,272 --> 00:21:19,641
I'm so glad I found you.

405
00:21:19,643 --> 00:21:22,411
I've been looking
everywhere.

406
00:21:23,546 --> 00:21:26,148
This is all my fault.

407
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:29,051
I did this to you.

408
00:21:29,053 --> 00:21:31,220
When you broke up with me,
it was a cry for help,

409
00:21:31,222 --> 00:21:34,556
and I didn't listen.

410
00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:39,261
I should be punished.

411
00:21:39,263 --> 00:21:42,297
I deserve to be punished.

412
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:46,568
Someone hurts you,
and you hurt them worse.

413
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,838
You hurt them permanently.

414
00:21:51,274 --> 00:21:53,842
You should just kill me.

415
00:21:53,844 --> 00:21:55,744
Kill me.

416
00:21:57,547 --> 00:22:00,148
Kill me.

417
00:22:04,762 --> 00:22:06,528
Oliver, where have you
been?

418
00:22:06,553 --> 00:22:07,793
Haven't you got
any of my calls?

419
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:09,760
I've been busy.
What's wrong?

420
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:11,996
It's your mother.
She'll do fine.

421
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:14,198
No, she won't.

422
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,567
She's not using
this event to rally the troops.

423
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:18,235
She's using it...

424
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:20,938
to tell people she's dropping
out of the race.

425
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:30,648
Oliver.

426
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:33,250
What happened?

427
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:35,319
It's a motorcycle
accident,

428
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:37,021
it was stupid.

429
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:40,725
Yes, this would be the second
accident in as many weeks,

430
00:22:40,727 --> 00:22:42,460
if my math is correct.

431
00:22:42,462 --> 00:22:44,295
Mark says you're dropping
out of the race.

432
00:22:44,297 --> 00:22:48,065
The truth is, I should
have done it weeks ago,

433
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:50,234
after Thea was abducted.

434
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:53,938
My complete focus needs
to be on repairing our relationship.

435
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,773
Mom, what's happening
with Thea right now

436
00:22:55,775 --> 00:22:57,875
isn't because you weren't spending
enough time with her.

437
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:00,010
Well, maybe not.
I have to do something

438
00:23:00,012 --> 00:23:03,147
and I'm not sure
what else to do.

439
00:23:03,149 --> 00:23:07,518
Thea hates you right now
because of the things that you've done.

440
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,955
Terrible things.

441
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:15,493
So let her see you
do something good.

442
00:23:15,495 --> 00:23:19,063
As mayor.

443
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:25,703
Mom, I know a little
something about...

444
00:23:25,705 --> 00:23:30,274
Sacrificing the people
closest to me

445
00:23:30,276 --> 00:23:33,344
for the good
of this city.

446
00:23:33,346 --> 00:23:37,481
It's what you need
to do now.

447
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:39,683
I know.

448
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:43,154
Good.

449
00:23:43,156 --> 00:23:45,389
Oliver, I know.

450
00:23:47,325 --> 00:23:50,795
I know.

451
00:23:58,804 --> 00:24:02,673
I've known...
since last year,

452
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:04,341
I suppose.

453
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:06,644
The night of the Undertaking,

454
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:09,914
everything became so clear.

455
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,351
It was pretty much the night
I stopped sleeping.

456
00:24:14,353 --> 00:24:16,086
Before you say
anything else--

457
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:17,555
There's nothing else to say.

458
00:24:17,557 --> 00:24:19,490
Nothing I need to say.

459
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:26,330
Except I could not
be more proud.

460
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:33,270
Can I have Raisa get you
anything to drink?

461
00:24:33,272 --> 00:24:36,707
Or--or something to eat,
perhaps? Please.

462
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:39,777
Where's Oliver?

463
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:43,147
Ah, he's...running
an errand for me.

464
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:46,217
I thought it would
give us a chance to talk.

465
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:54,058
With all due respect, um,
Mrs. Queen,

466
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:57,027
what's happening,
it's between me and your son.

467
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:59,063
Yes.

468
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,505
What is that?

469
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:09,640
Oh, I had one
of our investigators

470
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:11,742
write up a dossier on you.
I'm sorry, but it's a necessary

471
00:25:11,744 --> 00:25:15,713
precaution against
a fraudulent claim of paternity.

472
00:25:15,715 --> 00:25:17,381
Well, the baby
is Oliver's.

473
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:18,849
Oh, of that I have no doubt.

474
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,285
Our investigators
were quite thorough.

475
00:25:21,287 --> 00:25:23,320
But you can imagine

476
00:25:23,322 --> 00:25:26,290
how many people
my family attracts

477
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:29,226
who are looking for handouts.

478
00:25:29,228 --> 00:25:31,195
Well, I'm not
looking for money.

479
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:34,598
Of course not.

480
00:25:35,901 --> 00:25:38,335
I told you,
I don't want money.

481
00:25:38,337 --> 00:25:40,004
And I'm telling you

482
00:25:40,006 --> 00:25:42,406
that this is
my first grandchild.

483
00:25:42,408 --> 00:25:47,411
And I want to make certain
that he or she has a bright future.

484
00:25:47,413 --> 00:25:49,580
Please.

485
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,852
This is
a million dollars.

486
00:25:54,854 --> 00:25:58,923
I want to make certain
that my son has a bright future as well.

487
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:01,825
That money is yours

488
00:26:01,827 --> 00:26:05,563
once you tell Oliver
that you've lost the baby.

489
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:07,231
What?!

490
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:09,600
And another million
when you return to Central City,

491
00:26:09,602 --> 00:26:11,835
never to speak to him again.

492
00:26:11,837 --> 00:26:14,572
Can I offer you some advice,

493
00:26:14,574 --> 00:26:16,607
one mother to another?

494
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:19,009
When it comes to your children,
there is no action

495
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:20,438
that is inconceivable;

496
00:26:20,463 --> 00:26:22,463
There is no decision
that is impossible.

497
00:26:22,882 --> 00:26:26,183
You do what you must
to provide the life that they need.

498
00:26:26,185 --> 00:26:29,019
And I think that $2 million

499
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:33,457
is sufficient to provide
the life that both our children need.

500
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:38,062
Don't you?

501
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:49,907
When I was first approached
about entering this race,

502
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:52,476
the prospect of winning
seemed a distant,

503
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:55,479
nearly impossible feat.

504
00:26:55,481 --> 00:26:57,982
Now, how could a city that had
suffered so much

505
00:26:57,984 --> 00:27:01,952
place its faith in someone
so responsible for its suffering?

506
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:04,521
But as the weeks progressed,

507
00:27:04,523 --> 00:27:07,558
good people such as you
raised your voices

508
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:12,129
in support, and I began to think
that I could make a difference.

509
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:14,965
I could help
save this city.

510
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:21,405
But...

511
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:24,375
Recent events
have changed things,

512
00:27:24,377 --> 00:27:26,443
and...

513
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:42,559
and now I know I can
make a difference.

514
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:48,432
And should the honor
become mine,

515
00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:51,435
I promise with
every breath I take

516
00:27:51,437 --> 00:27:53,871
to do what is necessary;

517
00:27:53,873 --> 00:27:57,474
to sacrifice what is necessary
for the good of this city.

518
00:27:57,476 --> 00:28:00,878
Starling City is my
home, you are my family,

519
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,315
and there is nothing
more important to me than family.

520
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:08,352
Thank you,
thank you all.

521
00:28:10,823 --> 00:28:12,523
Ahh!
Great speech, Moira.

522
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:15,225
A little too off-book
for my liking,

523
00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:17,027
but we'll work on that.

524
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,662
I thought it was perfect.

525
00:28:18,664 --> 00:28:22,132
Um...Hi.

526
00:28:22,134 --> 00:28:25,836
I just wanted to come up here
and say a few words.

527
00:28:25,838 --> 00:28:29,473
I am so proud
to have my mom here tonight

528
00:28:29,475 --> 00:28:32,976
at my club, Verdant,
in the Glades.

529
00:28:32,978 --> 00:28:34,178
What is she doing?

530
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,547
She knows this is
being televised.

531
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:40,217
She's sending a message to Roy,
trying to draw him out.

532
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:43,520
So vote Queen.
Tell your friends.

533
00:28:43,522 --> 00:28:45,923
Thanks.

534
00:28:45,925 --> 00:28:47,524
Thea, that was--

535
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:49,493
That was not for you.

536
00:28:57,136 --> 00:28:58,669
Oh, God, you're heavy.

537
00:28:58,671 --> 00:29:00,137
Is this really all muscle?

538
00:29:00,139 --> 00:29:02,306
Ahem. How many of those
venom arrows do we have?

539
00:29:02,308 --> 00:29:04,341
About 20.
I need all of them.

540
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:06,543
Okay. Are you sure
that's a good idea?

541
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:08,912
Can you even get into
those leather pants with that knee?

542
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:11,281
Lidocaine. Now.

543
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:13,851
Ok.

544
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,188
Let's see, the bottle
says the proper dose is...

545
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:20,424
Is all of it.

546
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:22,626
I don't think
that's a good--ooh.

547
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,403
Terrific speech,
Moira.

548
00:29:33,405 --> 00:29:35,206
How did we not think of running
you years ago?

549
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:36,940
Thank you.

550
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:39,910
Uh, can you give me a moment?

551
00:29:39,912 --> 00:29:42,079
Mm-hmm,
of course.

552
00:29:42,081 --> 00:29:44,014
Oh, hello.

553
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:51,655
You need to go now!
No, no, no!

554
00:29:51,657 --> 00:29:52,990
I can't leave
without my daughter!

555
00:29:52,992 --> 00:29:54,558
I'll see to the safety
of your daughter!

556
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,692
Go, go! Thea,
we have to go now!

557
00:29:55,694 --> 00:29:57,094
No, it's Roy!

558
00:29:57,096 --> 00:29:58,697
I'm not leaving him!
He came here for me!

559
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,273
Roy.

560
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:10,607
Roy, listen to me!

561
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:12,810
Listen to my voice!

562
00:30:12,812 --> 00:30:14,678
I don't know what's
going on with you,

563
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,213
but I have to believe the man
I fell in love with

564
00:30:16,215 --> 00:30:19,449
is still inside
there, somewhere.

565
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:20,818
You have to fight.
You're strong.

566
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:24,321
You can fight this.
Fight this!

567
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:33,497
Roy!

568
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,999
Put her down.

569
00:30:42,444 --> 00:30:43,811
Please don't.

570
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:45,927
He can't control it!

571
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:47,962
That's why I don't
have a choice.

572
00:30:47,964 --> 00:30:49,730
Whoa!
Get out of the way.

573
00:30:49,732 --> 00:30:51,332
Don't do this.

574
00:30:57,005 --> 00:30:59,240
Kill me.

575
00:30:59,242 --> 00:31:02,343
Please. Kill me.

576
00:31:02,345 --> 00:31:04,745
Please
don't do it!

577
00:31:12,687 --> 00:31:16,624
No one dies tonight.

578
00:31:16,626 --> 00:31:18,859
The police...

579
00:31:18,861 --> 00:31:20,261
Go outside.

580
00:31:20,263 --> 00:31:21,896
We'll get Roy
the help he needs.

581
00:31:21,898 --> 00:31:23,664
I promise! Go!

582
00:31:27,436 --> 00:31:30,638
Ah, Tibetan
pit viper venom.

583
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,307
A constant dose of that can't be
good for you. Right?

584
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:35,142
It'll keep him sedated
like it did Slade.

585
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:35,900
Until when?

586
00:31:35,925 --> 00:31:37,412
And what happens
when we run out?

587
00:31:37,413 --> 00:31:39,313
It's not like you can buy this stuff
over the counter.

588
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:42,616
Unless you're in Tibet.
Then...maybe.

589
00:31:42,618 --> 00:31:44,952
We'll take care of him.

590
00:31:49,958 --> 00:31:53,461
I'm not ready
to give up on Roy.

591
00:31:55,964 --> 00:31:59,233
Anyone else crave dim
sum after fisticuffs?

592
00:31:59,235 --> 00:32:00,734
No? Ok.

593
00:32:00,736 --> 00:32:03,370
Dumplings for one, then.

594
00:32:06,108 --> 00:32:08,642
I would have killed him.

595
00:32:10,245 --> 00:32:12,313
I was ready to.

596
00:32:12,315 --> 00:32:15,149
He'd be dead right now
if you wouldn't have stopped me.

597
00:32:15,151 --> 00:32:17,852
But he's not.

598
00:32:17,854 --> 00:32:20,454
That's all that matters.

599
00:32:20,456 --> 00:32:23,124
That's not true.

600
00:32:23,126 --> 00:32:26,427
I wanted to kill Roy.

601
00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:29,530
Because that's what I do.

602
00:32:29,532 --> 00:32:31,565
That's who I am.

603
00:32:31,567 --> 00:32:34,768
I spent six years
in the darkness.

604
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:37,905
And I looked into
the eyes of the devil

605
00:32:37,907 --> 00:32:40,941
and I gave him my soul.

606
00:32:40,943 --> 00:32:44,111
Let me help you
get it back.

607
00:32:44,113 --> 00:32:46,947
No, you deserve someone better.

608
00:32:46,949 --> 00:32:51,252
Someone who can harness
that light that's still inside of you.

609
00:32:51,254 --> 00:32:55,422
But I'm not that person.

610
00:32:55,424 --> 00:32:56,790
And I never will be.

611
00:32:56,792 --> 00:33:00,327
Sara...

612
00:33:00,329 --> 00:33:02,062
Don't.

613
00:33:03,331 --> 00:33:06,066
I'm sorry.

614
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:13,908
I just care about you
too much to be with you.

615
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,581
Hey.

616
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:22,917
Everything ok?

617
00:33:24,986 --> 00:33:27,188
Yeah. Just had
a long day.

618
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:28,923
How's Roy?
Well, he's alive,

619
00:33:28,925 --> 00:33:30,424
no thanks to me.

620
00:33:30,426 --> 00:33:33,127
You know, that was brave
getting between us.

621
00:33:33,129 --> 00:33:36,096
It took guts.
Not really.

622
00:33:36,098 --> 00:33:38,399
I knew you wouldn't
really hurt him.

623
00:33:38,401 --> 00:33:40,834
You're not a killer.

624
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:43,938
What's this for?

625
00:33:45,607 --> 00:33:46,941
Say good-bye.

626
00:33:46,943 --> 00:33:48,642
What? Wait,
where are you going?

627
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,346
To see an old friend.

628
00:34:05,827 --> 00:34:08,929
We've got every
cop in this city canvassing.

629
00:34:08,931 --> 00:34:09,997
We'll find
this guy.

630
00:34:09,999 --> 00:34:12,166
Thank you.

631
00:34:12,168 --> 00:34:13,200
You ok?

632
00:34:13,202 --> 00:34:15,903
Fine. Where were you?

633
00:34:15,905 --> 00:34:17,838
He was with me.

634
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:25,045
Glad to see the two
of you are getting along again.

635
00:34:25,047 --> 00:34:28,249
Thea...

636
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,571
You knew about Roy.

637
00:34:52,374 --> 00:34:55,042
What?

638
00:34:55,044 --> 00:34:58,646
That's why you had
your bodyguard stalking me.

639
00:34:58,648 --> 00:35:01,682
Somehow, you knew what
was going on with him.

640
00:35:05,887 --> 00:35:08,889
I'm just trying
to protect you.

641
00:35:08,891 --> 00:35:11,859
By not telling me the truth.

642
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:14,261
Just like
with Malcolm Merlyn.

643
00:35:14,263 --> 00:35:16,597
You know, the two of you,

644
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:20,768
you think you're
protecting me by lying

645
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:23,137
and by keeping secrets.

646
00:35:23,139 --> 00:35:26,006
But that's what's
actually hurting me.

647
00:35:29,077 --> 00:35:32,112
You're absolutely right.

648
00:35:33,315 --> 00:35:35,649
We need to turn a new page.

649
00:35:35,651 --> 00:35:37,484
It's not going
to be that simple.

650
00:35:37,486 --> 00:35:39,086
Or easy.

651
00:35:39,088 --> 00:35:41,588
I know. If the truth
were easy for me,

652
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:43,957
we wouldn't be
in this situation.

653
00:35:43,959 --> 00:35:47,995
But to start...

654
00:35:47,997 --> 00:35:52,266
There's something about Malcolm
that both you and Oliver

655
00:35:52,268 --> 00:35:55,169
need to know.

656
00:35:55,171 --> 00:35:57,104
Malcolm...

657
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:10,166
Oliver!

658
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,502
Oliver!

659
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:22,213
Oliver!

660
00:36:22,215 --> 00:36:23,914
Oliver!

661
00:36:27,152 --> 00:36:30,988
I was dead the last time
you were offered this choice.

662
00:36:31,675 --> 00:36:34,109
Slade...

663
00:36:34,111 --> 00:36:36,845
What's happening?

664
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:41,182
I often wonder
how you looked...

665
00:36:41,184 --> 00:36:45,320
When he pointed
the gun at Shado...

666
00:36:45,322 --> 00:36:47,789
And took her from me.

667
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:49,624
You psychopath.

668
00:36:49,626 --> 00:36:52,494
Shado...Shado
wasn't yours!

669
00:36:52,496 --> 00:36:55,130
No, she was yours.

670
00:36:55,132 --> 00:36:58,433
Until you chose
another woman over her.

671
00:36:58,435 --> 00:36:59,968
That's not
what happened!

672
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:03,438
It is what happened! It is!

673
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,308
She told me!

674
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:09,644
What do you mean, she?
There's nobody there!

675
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:11,780
Slade...

676
00:37:11,782 --> 00:37:16,084
You were on the island
with Oliver?

677
00:37:16,086 --> 00:37:20,288
I thought I had known
true despair,

678
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:23,758
until I met your son.

679
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,696
I trusted him...

680
00:37:27,698 --> 00:37:29,631
to make the right choice.

681
00:37:29,633 --> 00:37:31,499
Let me make
the right choice now.

682
00:37:31,501 --> 00:37:33,568
Kill me.

683
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:34,869
- No!
- No!

684
00:37:34,871 --> 00:37:36,171
Choose me, please!

685
00:37:36,173 --> 00:37:39,107
I am killing you, Oliver.

686
00:37:39,109 --> 00:37:42,978
Only more slowly
than you would like.

687
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,713
Don't.

688
00:37:44,715 --> 00:37:48,016
Choose.

689
00:37:48,018 --> 00:37:49,017
Don't--
choose.

690
00:37:49,019 --> 00:37:50,619
Please...

691
00:37:50,621 --> 00:37:52,087
Choose!

692
00:37:52,089 --> 00:37:55,123
I swear to God, I am
going to kill you!

693
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:57,058
No! No!

694
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,694
No.

695
00:37:59,696 --> 00:38:01,696
Mom...

696
00:38:02,632 --> 00:38:04,132
No!

697
00:38:04,134 --> 00:38:05,233
Mom, what
are you doing?

698
00:38:05,235 --> 00:38:06,968
There's only one way

699
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:09,204
this night can end.

700
00:38:09,206 --> 00:38:10,705
No!

701
00:38:15,378 --> 00:38:18,880
And we both know that.

702
00:38:18,882 --> 00:38:23,051
Don't we, Mr. Wilson?

703
00:38:23,053 --> 00:38:25,120
Mom!
Please, don't!

704
00:38:25,122 --> 00:38:28,189
Both my children
will live.

705
00:38:28,191 --> 00:38:29,724
Mom!

706
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:31,559
What are you doing?!

707
00:38:32,729 --> 00:38:35,664
Thea, I love you.

708
00:38:35,666 --> 00:38:37,899
Close your eyes, baby!

709
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:39,567
No!

710
00:38:41,671 --> 00:38:45,874
You possess true courage.

711
00:38:52,214 --> 00:38:54,883
I am truly sorry...

712
00:38:54,885 --> 00:38:57,686
What?

713
00:38:59,522 --> 00:39:02,057
You did not pass that on

714
00:39:02,059 --> 00:39:04,059
to your son.

715
00:39:06,062 --> 00:39:09,230
No!

716
00:39:09,232 --> 00:39:11,366
No!

717
00:39:17,573 --> 00:39:20,408
There is still one person

718
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:23,278
who has to die...

719
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,182
Before this can end.

720
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:35,457
Mom?

721
00:39:35,459 --> 00:39:37,926
Mom! No!

722
00:39:37,928 --> 00:39:39,694
No! Mom!

723
00:39:43,233 --> 00:39:46,768
Well, yeah, I'm sorry, too.

724
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:51,072
Well, listen, if there's
ever anything that I can do--

725
00:39:52,208 --> 00:39:54,476
hello?

726
00:39:59,081 --> 00:40:01,616
Who was that?

727
00:40:01,618 --> 00:40:04,886
That was, um...

728
00:40:07,623 --> 00:40:11,459
She lost the baby.

729
00:40:11,461 --> 00:40:13,328
Oh.

730
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,230
She said she's sad about it,

731
00:40:15,232 --> 00:40:18,399
and she's going to go
back to school in Central City.

732
00:40:19,568 --> 00:40:22,437
Apparently
she has family there.

733
00:40:22,439 --> 00:40:26,207
Well, I'm sure this has been
very traumatic for her.

734
00:40:26,209 --> 00:40:28,309
But it sounds
for the best.

735
00:40:28,311 --> 00:40:29,911
Hmm?

736
00:40:29,913 --> 00:40:32,413
- Sure.
- You ok?

737
00:40:32,415 --> 00:40:35,116
Yeah. Yes.

738
00:40:36,752 --> 00:40:40,688
I continue to be
the luckiest guy on the planet.

739
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:42,991
What...

740
00:40:42,993 --> 00:40:47,328
What would I have done if she...

741
00:40:53,302 --> 00:40:55,170
Ahh.

742
00:40:55,172 --> 00:40:58,439
I'm not ready to be a dad.

743
00:40:58,441 --> 00:41:02,043
No. But someday.

744
00:41:02,045 --> 00:41:04,646
It's my fondest hope
for you.

745
00:41:06,683 --> 00:41:09,751
I'm glad I told you.

746
00:41:11,754 --> 00:41:13,354
I don't think that I could have

747
00:41:13,356 --> 00:41:14,823
gotten through something
like this without you.

748
00:41:14,825 --> 00:41:18,960
You're never without me.

749
00:41:18,962 --> 00:41:22,163
My beautiful boy.

750
00:41:22,165 --> 00:41:24,966
Ohh.

751
00:41:33,576 --> 00:41:36,744
It's, uh...

752
00:41:36,746 --> 00:41:38,980
I love you.

753
00:41:38,982 --> 00:41:41,482
I love you.

754
