Besides, we got
a very important job for you.

[Connie] <i>Hey, Billy,

You don't need the discs.

Okay. Different strokes, man.

You can't watch porn while the sun's out.

If I get up at that hearing, I'm dead.

Okay.

A fucking prodigy.

I lit my first fire at 4,
burned my whole house down.

My dad,

Now look at me.

while the heroes are out there,
doing the fucking.

My mom, she, uh...

00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:18,136
Never mind.

00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:23,267
After she was gone,

224

I watched my dad
do nothing his whole life.

225
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:33,819
But, me, I thought
I'd finally found something.

I thought I found what I was meant to do.

But it turns out,
I'm shit at that as well.

You're not the cuck.

I'm the cuck.

[Stormfront]
Heck, yeah. I want to be clear.

No one condones the tragic shooting

Our thoughts and prayers go out
to Kuldeep Singh's family.

Just let them in,

I gotta be honest with you now.

[grunts]

318
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:29,281
What, no hug?

319
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:31,283
You step one inch closer,

320
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:34,035
and I'll kill you quicker
than that fucking ass cancer.

321
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:35,287
I'll bet you would.

322
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,958
I seen on the news,
you topped that Stillwell slag.

323
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:43,420
It weren't me,
but thanks for your support.

324
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,964
Hey, please, please.

325
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,091
I just wanna talk.

326
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:56,349
Two minutes.

327
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:00,645
Ooh.

328
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:05,108
Been following the Ashes?

329
00:17:05,817 --> 00:17:08,028
You wanna talk about fucking cricket?

330
00:17:08,111 --> 00:17:10,655
You remember the '83 World Cup?

331
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:12,949
I took you to every match.

332
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:15,869
Leeds, Old Trafford.

333
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,037
You loved it.

334
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,539
Did you know why I loved it?

335
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:23,251
You'd get on the piss
with your loser mates.

336
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:26,504
I could fuck off for hours,
and you'd never know.

337
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:28,089
Let's not do this, then.

338
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:29,591
Yeah, let's not.

339
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:32,052
I know I was no perfect father.

340
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:35,513
I know I never got a chance
to say goodbye to Lenny.

341
00:17:35,597 --> 00:17:36,848
I don't want that with you.

342
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:39,351
Didn't have a chance
to say goodbye to Lenny?

343
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:41,645
You're the reason he's dead.

344
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:45,482
Let me tell you something, William.
It's a shit world out there.

345
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:48,318
You can't rely on no one but yourself.

346
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,862
You either sink, or you swim.

347
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:54,241
And in Lenny's case, he chose to sink.

348
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:57,953
You don't have the fucking right
to mention his name.

349
00:17:58,036 --> 00:18:00,163
I fucking loved Lenny.

350
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:05,752
But he wasn't hard like you.
That's why you're here, and he's dead.

351
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,838
You beat the fucking shit
out of the both of us.

352
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:11,383
Maybe I pushed you a bit hard.

353
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:13,134
But look at you.

354
00:18:13,218 --> 00:18:15,637
- Get off.
- You afraid of anything? No?

355
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,515
Are you
the strongest bastard you know?

356
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:19,432
Yeah.

357
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:24,980
Tougher than I ever was.

358
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:30,568
Oh, you're welcome, asshole.

359
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:40,870
Lenny stuck that gun in his mouth
when you couldn't hack it anymore,

360
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:44,624
and you pissed off
to join the SAS, like a right cunt.

361
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:48,086
You're the one who abandoned him, not me.

362
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:56,636
You're a fucking monster.

363
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,055
- It takes one to know one.
- Billy, for Christ's sake.

364
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:00,724
Pack it in. Pack it in.

365
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02,350
Stop.

366
00:19:02,434 --> 00:19:05,061
Jesus Christ.

367
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:06,271
What have you done?

368
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:08,606
See?

369
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,735
Lenny could never have done that.

370
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,696
[Connie] Christ, Billy.

371

Jesus.

372
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:25,749
- Sorry, we gotta go.
- All right, guys.

373
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,584
Thanks very much. Take care. God bless.

374
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:28,501
God bless.

375
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:30,378
- It's a mistake.
- What is?

376
00:19:30,462 --> 00:19:32,464
Keeping fucking Starlight alive.

377
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:34,007
Yep.

378
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:41,931
I underestimated her before.
I will not do it again.

379
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:44,017
"Starlight is a Traitor"
is trending number one.

380
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,561
We've got a million tweets
in support of Compound V.

381
00:19:46,644 --> 00:19:48,813
A common enemy rallies the base.

382
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:50,482
Just trust me.

383
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:51,775
All right.

384
00:19:52,484 --> 00:19:54,986
And if I can
get my hands on Hugh Campbell,

385
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,781
maybe pull his spine
out the back of his neck.

386
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:00,825
You okay?

387
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:02,660
Yeah, I just, um...

388
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,788
[Homelander] Your daughter?

389
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,081
Yeah.

390
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:11,086
Eighty years ago,
she looked exactly like that.

391
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:14,422
Sometimes it feels like yesterday.

392
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:23,390
I got something I want to show you.

393
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:28,144
Want to finish up the backyard?

394
00:20:28,228 --> 00:20:30,688
Okay, I'm gonna put this person...

395
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:34,984
Hey, guys.

396
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:37,320
Hello.

397
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:40,490
This is Stormfront.
Stormfront, this is Rebecca.

398
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:44,661
Very nice to meet you.

399
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:47,038
And this, my son.

400
00:20:47,122 --> 00:20:49,040
Hey, buddy. How you doing?

401
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:51,626
Listen, um...

402
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,714
I know last time, I screwed up bigtime.

403
00:20:56,798 --> 00:20:58,466
And I just want you to know,

404
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:01,386
I'm never gonna
push you that hard again, okay?

405
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:07,642
All right, Ryan,
I'd love you to meet my girlfriend.

406
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:09,144
Stormfront.

407
00:21:09,227 --> 00:21:11,729
- Wow, he looks just like you.
- [Homelander] You think?

408
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:13,982
[Stormfront] Are you serious? Those eyes.

409
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:15,316
Hey, Ryan.

410
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,485
Your daddy told me all about you.

411
00:21:17,569 --> 00:21:19,988
- You have superpowers, huh?
- [Homefront] Mm-hm.

412
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,741
That makes you very, very special.

413
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:28,872
You are the first natural-born superhero.

414
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:30,373
Can we not?

415
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,042
That's right. Um...

416
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:34,878
Ryan does have powers,

417
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:38,298
but his mom doesn't like
to talk about them, or use them.

418
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:40,383
Can you also let me know
before you just pop by?

419
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:43,011
He's Ryan's father.
He has a right to see his son.

420
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:45,013
That's very true, but look.

421
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:47,390
We all just have
Ryan's best interests at heart, right?

422
00:21:47,474 --> 00:21:48,308
Yes, we do.

423
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:50,477
I'm sorry I haven't been here enough.

424
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,272
Ryan, I'd really like you
to get to know Stormfront.

425
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:56,274
I would.
She's someone I care about very much.

426
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:58,735
And I think you will too.

427
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:02,780
So I think we'll be around more.

428
00:22:02,864 --> 00:22:03,865
A lot more.

429
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,076
I want us to be a family.

430
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:12,207
[door closes]

431
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:14,501
Hey.

Empire Wok.

433
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:19,672
Hi.

434
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:25,011
That was a fraught "hi."

435
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,682
I'm going to my sister's for a while.

436
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:35,480
I have a plan.

437
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:37,524
You don't need
to be scared of Homelander...

438
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:38,900
That little girl.

439
00:22:38,983 --> 00:22:40,193
On the plane.

440
00:22:42,654 --> 00:22:45,782
What she must have gone through
in those last few moments.

441
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,825
I lie awake every night
thinking about that.

442
00:22:47,909 --> 00:22:48,910
Me too.

443
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:50,078
Then I start snowballing,

444
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:52,455
and wondering,
how many other people have you killed?

445
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:54,332
- What else have you done?
- I had no choice.

446
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:58,086
I'm not blaming you.
I'm not. It is not your fault.

447
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:00,588
Will you just...? Will you sit down?

448
00:23:00,672 --> 00:23:01,548
It's not fair.

449
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:05,843
- Will you sit down?
- I wish I were as strong as you.

450
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:07,136
But I'm not.

451
00:23:08,972 --> 00:23:10,557
I just need time.

Over and over...

00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:27,198
you said you wanted to see the real me.

455

This is the real me.

We're on the wrong team.

Grace, I thought you retired.

Dr. Vogelbaum. I thought you were taller.

Sonia, can you get some tea?

Thank you,
but we won't be staying long enough.

Ah, yes,
there's that Waspy patrician tone.

All business.

473

What do you know about Sage Grove Centre?

474
00:24:36,726 --> 00:24:38,394
Never heard of it. Should I have?

475

Considering Vought's
been doing illegal tests there

476
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:43,650
since you were the CSO,
and they're still doing them to this day.

- Seems like you should've.
- Horrible.

478

Maybe it was
Sonnenshine's project over in R & D.

637
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:29,466
- [Homelander] Yeah.
- Like <i>NBA 2K.</i>

638
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,718
Pew Die Pie?

639
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:33,053
What's that?

640
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:36,557
Or what about one of your dad's movies?

641
00:33:37,308 --> 00:33:38,350
You're in movies?

642
00:33:39,268 --> 00:33:41,687
I'm in a bunch of movies, man. Let's see.

643
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:45,024
There's <i>Homelander: Origins.
Homelander: Rise of a Hero.</i>

644
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:47,568
<i>Homelander: Darkest Day.
Homelander: Brightest Night.</i>

645
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:49,111
Oh, your dad is so good

646
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:51,572
- in <i>Homelander: Brightest Night.</i>
- [Homelander] Thank you.

647
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:55,409
- [Ryan] Mom, can I see them?
- When you're old enough, we can talk.

648
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:58,287
Ah, they're PG. He can see them now.
You're old enough.

649
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,830
You're absolutely old enough.

650
00:33:59,914 --> 00:34:02,625
For sleepovers, and baseball games,

651
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:04,335
and visits to Vought Land.

652
00:34:04,418 --> 00:34:05,628
Yeah.

653
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:09,215
Did you know that
your dad has his own roller coaster?

654
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:12,134
- Mm-hm.
- Wanna ride your dad's roller coaster?

655
00:34:12,218 --> 00:34:13,802
- Can I, Mom?
- We can talk about it.

656
00:34:13,886 --> 00:34:14,970
Whenever you want.

657
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:19,183
I need to speak with you.

658
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:21,393
- We're having a good time here, right?
- Outside.

659
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:23,979
Now.

660
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:31,904
That's a great idea. You two, stay here.

661
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,156
- Get to know each other better.
- [Ryan] Okay.

662
00:34:35,866 --> 00:34:38,744
I'll show you <i>Dances With Wolves.</i>

663
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:40,996
- I know what you're doing.
- Nope, you don't.

664
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,207
- Yes, I do. I can see...
- No, you do not.

665
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:46,543
You could not possibly understand.

666
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:48,671
I was raised the same way as him.

667
00:34:48,754 --> 00:34:51,632
That kid
doesn't know anything about anything.

668
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:54,635
When he sees the outside world,
he's going to panic.

669
00:34:54,718 --> 00:34:56,053
That's gonna fuck him up.

670
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:01,141
I do not want my son to have
to go through what I went through.

671
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:06,563
His life is different.

672
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,525
He has a mother.

673
00:35:10,401 --> 00:35:12,486
I know that
that means something to you.

674
00:35:12,569 --> 00:35:13,821
If you take him away from me,

675
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:17,116
this world will feel
so confusing and frightening.

676
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:18,784
Yes, but, Rebecca,

677
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:21,912
you are lying to him.

678
00:35:21,996 --> 00:35:23,914
Because I love him.

679
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:28,335
I know a part of you loves him too,
and you want what's best for him.

680
00:35:28,419 --> 00:35:32,089
But what's best for him is
to be here with me, with his mother.

681
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:38,053
Look, we have this opportunity
to give him a childhood you never had.

682
00:35:38,137 --> 00:35:40,306
We can do that if he's here with me.

683
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:44,601
Please. I'm begging you, please.

684
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:53,944
Yeah.

685
00:35:57,323 --> 00:36:00,326
[Sonia] <i>I'm sorry, he's very tired.</i>

686
00:36:00,409 --> 00:36:03,787
I understand
he's had a few surprise visitors today.

687
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:05,998
But you tell him he's got one more.

688
00:36:06,874 --> 00:36:08,917
The name's William Butcher.

689
00:36:12,004 --> 00:36:13,213
[door buzzes]

690
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:24,350
Mr. Butcher, I can't apologise enough
for what I've done.

691
00:36:24,433 --> 00:36:26,310
But I can't give you the information...

692
00:36:26,393 --> 00:36:28,020
[chair screeching]

693
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:34,068
But I can't give you the information
you or Grace came for either.

694
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:45,788
What was he like?

695
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:47,790
Who?

696
00:36:48,499 --> 00:36:51,418
Homelander. Growing up as a lad.
What was he like?

697
00:36:55,381 --> 00:36:57,466
I'm sure you
don't want to talk about this...

698
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:59,968
There is nothing I wanna talk about more.

699
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:02,846
And who knows better than you?

700
00:37:05,974 --> 00:37:09,978
When he was a little boy,
5 or 6, he was quite sweet.

701
00:37:11,355 --> 00:37:12,648
He'd cuddle up to me.

702
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:18,404
He loved stories about
Davy Crockett, Teddy Roosevelt.

703
00:37:19,029 --> 00:37:24,034
Loved the idea of the woods,
the forest, manifest destiny.

704
00:37:25,828 --> 00:37:28,997
But I needed him
to be the strongest man in the world.

705
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:31,834
So I went to work on him.

706
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,628
He didn't even want it.

707
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:38,632
It was for me.

708
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:43,679
Mm-hm.

709
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:47,683
And that wasn't your only sin...

710
00:37:50,102 --> 00:37:51,228
was it?

711
00:37:53,522 --> 00:37:57,276
It wasn't Homelander
who hid my wife away all them years.

712
00:37:58,318 --> 00:38:00,028
It ever occur to you...

713
00:38:01,405 --> 00:38:05,242
the pain you cause sorry bastards like me?

714
00:38:06,452 --> 00:38:09,413
At the time,
it was barely a blip on my radar.

715
00:38:13,459 --> 00:38:14,793
Tell me, doctor.

716
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:19,381
What's your radar telling you now?

717
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:22,384
Do what you want to me,
but I can't help you.

718
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:24,344
My family would be in...

719
00:38:24,428 --> 00:38:26,847
Your family's already in trouble.

720
00:38:27,931 --> 00:38:31,852
Because I'm about to go into
that room next door, to your daughter,

721
00:38:32,436 --> 00:38:34,480
and I'm gonna bash her brains out.

722
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:37,357
And then I'm gonna find your two sons,

723
00:38:37,441 --> 00:38:40,611
and their wives, and their little kiddies.

724
00:38:41,695 --> 00:38:46,366
Your whole fucking family dies today.

725
00:38:48,368 --> 00:38:49,203
Or...

726
00:38:50,871 --> 00:38:52,122
you help me.

727
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:01,840
What's it gonna be, doc?

728
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:05,093
How...?

729
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:08,096
How can you be so...?

I can't remember the last time
I had a good cup of chai?

This is it, 42D.

740
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:52,015
She's gonna be there?

This is the conference room.
She's not here.

00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,468
They moved my statue?

745
00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:30,512
What?

746
00:40:36,602 --> 00:40:39,563
- I wanted to do it in front of my statue.
- Do what?

747
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,576
I just wanted to make my dad proud.

748
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:01,209
Oh, no, no. What the fuck?

Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
