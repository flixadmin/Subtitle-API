out of the universe.

318

326
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,671
I must say, it is remarkable,

327
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:36,374
really astounding
the success that
the CIA has had

328
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:38,242
since you have taken
operational control,

329
00:19:38,244 --> 00:19:40,878
and so the president
has asked me to ask you

330
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,181
to ask him,

331
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:45,316
to invite you both, uh,

332
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:47,718
over to the white house
just to powwow,

333
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:52,456
where we get maybe
some more specifics
about how

334
00:19:52,458 --> 00:19:55,526
exactly you're hunting
the enemy Decepticons left.

335
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,362
I've had my desk for two years.

336
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,198
Mr. attinger has been here

337
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,699
for 25.
He runs the projects

338
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,335
where I don't ask for specifics.

339
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:06,537
That's why they're
called black ops.

340
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,806
And why we all sleep
better at night.

341
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:10,608
Check. That is great.
So, um...

342
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,614
Any dirt on that?
Uh, how, uh, that's going?

343
00:20:18,917 --> 00:20:20,484
Outstanding.

344
00:20:20,486 --> 00:20:22,220
Great. Oh, great.

345
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:23,854
I was hoping to hear that.
The president
will be pleased.

346
00:20:23,856 --> 00:20:25,890
'Cause, I'll tell you
right now, I've only been

347
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:27,858

348

um, but I do know that the
alien war stuff, these are...

349
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:34,365
These are the only fun meetings.

350
00:20:34,367 --> 00:20:36,434
ATTINGER: Look, I'm not here
to entertain the president,

351
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:39,437
but you may tell him
that the war will be over.

352
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,008
"...be over..."
In case he asks,

353
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,576
I just like to have
an exact quote.

354
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,811
"War will be over soon."

355
00:20:46,813 --> 00:20:48,613
That is great.
Such good news.

356
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:52,650
And, um, the president
would, I know, just love...

357
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:54,018
Really, really love

Not flesh, obviously,

359
00:20:56,522 --> 00:20:58,823
but just maybe get
a shot with, um...

360
00:20:58,825 --> 00:21:00,391
Is it lord prime?
Sir prime?

361
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:02,660
We could bop on air force one.

362
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:04,562
It'd be just a quick bop,
then we just bop in and
bop back.

363
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:06,397
ATTINGER: I wouldn't get
his hopes up on that one.
Okay.

But aren't they
our friends? Why?

367
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:19,343
Because our world will
never truly be safe

368
00:21:19,345 --> 00:21:20,385
till all of them are gone.

369
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,948
Oh. Well, I would
hope we could do

370
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,483
a much more ceremonial farewell.

371
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:27,485

It's the American thing to do.

475
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:24,081
Here we go.
You're supposed to call,

476
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,616
and if it ends up being alien,

477
00:26:25,618 --> 00:26:26,984
then you win $25,000.

478
00:26:26,986 --> 00:26:28,252
You don't win money.

479
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:29,653
And if you can
capture it live...

480

Like tag it like
a wild wildebeest,

then you get $100,000.

a transformer there from
the battle of Chicago,

485
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:42,266
I need to know how it works.

This could be a game
changer for me!

technology to
my inventions,

488

worry about money again.

Besides, you used
my money to buy
the truck, right?

493
00:26:55,982 --> 00:26:58,115

that's my truck.

00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:14,999
so basically, I own you.

501
00:27:15,001 --> 00:27:17,201
I don't think you
can own someone.

Well, raise your hand

951
00:54:24,862 --> 00:54:26,929
if you're thoroughly
disenchanted

952
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:28,764
with our little
pleasant earth vacation.

953
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:31,000
So, who's the stowaways?

954
00:54:31,002 --> 00:54:32,701
Oh, whoa, hey,
what's with the gun?

955
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:34,470
Stop. Hound,
both of you.

956
00:54:34,472 --> 00:54:36,472
They've risked their
lives for mine.

957

OPTIMUS: <i> We owe them.</i>

958
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:43,412
<i>So, there's been</i>

959
00:54:43,414 --> 00:54:45,781
HOUND: <i> Nada.</i>
We are all that's left.

960
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:47,816
CROSSHAIRS: They're
picking us off, one by one.

961
00:54:47,818 --> 00:54:49,952
We're the pathetic,
dirty foursome.

962
00:54:49,954 --> 00:54:51,053
And you make five.

963
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,757
So that's our
best-case scenario?

964
00:54:55,759 --> 00:54:57,393
Autobot Witness Protection?

965
00:54:58,361 --> 00:54:59,662
Hey, speed racer,

966
00:54:59,664 --> 00:55:01,830
you're welcome to leave anytime.

967
00:55:01,832 --> 00:55:04,300
Well, for the record, superdad,

968
00:55:04,302 --> 00:55:05,934
I'm not hiding with you.

969
00:55:05,936 --> 00:55:07,936
I'm hiding out
with that big guy.

970
00:55:07,938 --> 00:55:10,572
<i>Sensei,</i> with your fate unknown,

971
00:55:10,574 --> 00:55:12,741
Bumblebee has held command,

972
00:55:12,743 --> 00:55:15,744
despite his complete
and total lack of anything

973
00:55:15,746 --> 00:55:17,346
resembling warrior discipline.

974
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:19,481
He's like a child.

975
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:20,716
<i>This child is about</i>
<i>to kick your ass.</i>

976
00:55:20,718 --> 00:55:21,984
He brings us shame.

977
00:55:24,554 --> 00:55:25,688
HOUND: Cage fight.

978
00:55:26,022 --> 00:55:27,556

979
00:55:27,558 --> 00:55:28,679
What's the matter with them?

980
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:33,495
Am I the lone sage
who sees through

981
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:36,098
this puppy-dog eyes act?
It's beneath you.

982
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,599
Yes, I've been waiting

983
00:55:37,601 --> 00:55:39,401
for them all
to dispatch each other,

984
00:55:39,403 --> 00:55:41,337
so I could take charge
with no trouble at all.

985
00:55:41,339 --> 00:55:43,405
Just me reporting to me.

986
00:55:43,407 --> 00:55:45,007
Well, it sure looks like
you've been missed.

987
00:55:45,009 --> 00:55:48,644
Autobots,
lock-down is hunting us

988
00:55:48,646 --> 00:55:51,013
and humans are helping.

989
00:55:51,015 --> 00:55:53,749
We need to know why.

990
00:55:53,751 --> 00:55:54,783
Well, listen, I don't know why,

991
00:55:54,785 --> 00:55:55,951
but I have an idea about who.

992
00:55:59,723 --> 00:56:02,124
This drone I stole recorded
footage of an autobot raid.

993
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:06,462
It's in pieces,
but watch what
happens here.

994
00:56:07,997 --> 00:56:09,998
HOUND: Oh,

995

997
00:56:13,604 --> 00:56:15,104
CADE: And later, this truck
comes to haul him off.

998
00:56:15,106 --> 00:56:16,939
Ksi. Kinetic solutions.

999
00:56:16,941 --> 00:56:19,375
Defense, aerospace,

1000
00:56:19,377 --> 00:56:21,477
They designed this drone.

1001
00:56:21,479 --> 00:56:22,811
So these government guys
just hunt you down,

1002
00:56:22,813 --> 00:56:24,134
and then pass you off
to this ksi?

1003
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:27,416
CADE: The company is
headquartered in Chicago.

1004
00:56:27,418 --> 00:56:28,951
That could be where
they were taken.

1005
00:56:28,953 --> 00:56:31,153
No way to get inside
without a battle.

1006
00:56:31,155 --> 00:56:33,722
Well, what if you had
some human help?

1007
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:35,023
What, are you two partners now?

1008
00:56:35,025 --> 00:56:38,627
We need to know why or we'll
never get our lives back.

1009
00:56:40,497 --> 00:56:42,731
I have sworn
to never kill humans.

1010
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:44,433
Big mistake.

1011
00:56:44,435 --> 00:56:46,034
But when I find out
who's behind this,

1012
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:49,571
he's going to die.

about a giant asteroid
that struck the earth

millions of years ago
and wiped out the dinosaurs?
