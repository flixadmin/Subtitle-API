1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:03,507
Time travel is real, and all of history

2
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:06,053
is vulnerable to attack,
which is why we must

3
00:00:06,055 --> 00:00:07,934
travel through time to stop the spread

4
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:09,801
of these so-called time aberrations

5
00:00:09,803 --> 00:00:12,618
and to erase their damage to history.

6
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,536
We are a team of outcasts and misfits,

7
00:00:15,538 --> 00:00:17,527
so, please, don't call us heroes.

8
00:00:17,529 --> 00:00:19,992
We're something else. We're legends.

9
00:00:20,449 --> 00:00:22,173
Previously, on "Legends of Tomorrow"...

10
00:00:22,175 --> 00:00:23,917
It's a compass. Either of you gentlemen

11
00:00:23,919 --> 00:00:25,747
heard of the Spear of Destiny?

12
00:00:25,749 --> 00:00:27,755
The spear could alter reality itself.

13
00:00:27,757 --> 00:00:29,659
We broke ike into four separate pieces.

14
00:00:29,661 --> 00:00:31,697
- Mr. Hunter took one.
- And took the rest of you

15
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,430
to three different time periods,

16
00:00:33,432 --> 00:00:34,962
which means the last piece unaccounted for

17
00:00:34,964 --> 00:00:36,430
must be with your grandfather.

18
00:00:36,432 --> 00:00:37,798
I'm rounding up the fragments.

19
00:00:38,801 --> 00:00:40,134
Ahh!

20
00:00:40,136 --> 00:00:41,685
The Legion of Doom are closing in on us

21
00:00:41,687 --> 00:00:42,686
as we speak.

22
00:00:44,273 --> 00:00:46,390
You're here to finish me off, Captain.

23
00:00:46,392 --> 00:00:48,392
No, saving your life.

24
00:00:48,394 --> 00:00:51,562
You are not captain, and
this is not your ship.

25
00:00:51,564 --> 00:00:53,397
Not anymore.

26
00:01:02,408 --> 00:01:04,708
Is there something
wrong with the interface?

27
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,160
I triple checked the connections,

28
00:01:06,162 --> 00:01:08,829
and everything seems fine.

29
00:01:08,831 --> 00:01:11,498
Look, it's an artifact from 33 A.D.

30
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,001
talking to an AI from the 22nd century.

31
00:01:14,003 --> 00:01:15,502
You just gotta give it some time.

32
00:01:15,504 --> 00:01:17,755
Hey, guys, anything?

33
00:01:17,757 --> 00:01:19,256
Not yet.

34
00:01:19,258 --> 00:01:20,891
Are you sure Stargirl doesn't know where

35
00:01:20,893 --> 00:01:22,593
- my grandfather ended up?
- No, the JSA thought

36
00:01:22,595 --> 00:01:24,311
the pieces of the spear would be safer

37
00:01:24,313 --> 00:01:25,929
if they didn't know where
Rip was dropping them off.

38
00:01:25,931 --> 00:01:28,098
Except Rip knows, which
means the Legion of Doom

39
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,316
probably already knows.

40
00:01:29,318 --> 00:01:30,934
They could already have my grandfather,

41
00:01:30,936 --> 00:01:32,903
or he could be dead, or
they're torturing him,

42
00:01:32,905 --> 00:01:34,354
- or he's dying, or...
- We're not gonna

43
00:01:34,356 --> 00:01:35,606
let that happen.

44
00:01:35,608 --> 00:01:37,608
It's not just about my grandfather.

45
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:40,244
It's about the entire fabric
of reality that's at stake here,

46
00:01:40,246 --> 00:01:41,912
which you think would be incentive enough

47
00:01:41,914 --> 00:01:44,114
for a certain talking computer
to buffer a little quicker.

48
00:01:44,116 --> 00:01:46,667
The name is Gideon, and I'm processing data

49
00:01:46,669 --> 00:01:48,168
as fast as I can.

50
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,787
Just... Just chill out, bro, all right?

51
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:51,455
Let Gideon do her thing.

52
00:01:51,457 --> 00:01:54,174
Look, soon as we lock in
a location on the fragment,

53
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,676
we'll head there right away.

54
00:01:55,678 --> 00:01:58,428
We're gonna save your
grandfather, and, you know,

55
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,131
the fabric of reality.

56
00:02:03,936 --> 00:02:05,769
Hey, yo, got an idea.

57
00:02:05,771 --> 00:02:08,138
If it's try to get Evil Rip
to tell us where and when

58
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,607
Commander Steel is, I already tried.

59
00:02:10,609 --> 00:02:11,859
And he didn't tell you nothing?

60
00:02:11,861 --> 00:02:13,110
No, he told me a lot of things.

61
00:02:13,112 --> 00:02:15,562
All different variations of "go to hell."

62
00:02:15,564 --> 00:02:16,897
So what we gonna do with him?

63
00:02:16,899 --> 00:02:18,365
Just leave him in the brig?

64
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:20,317
Until we figure out a
way to restore his mind,

65
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,735
then yeah, that's the plan.

66
00:02:21,737 --> 00:02:24,288
At least in the brig he can't hurt anyone.

67
00:02:26,826 --> 00:02:28,208
Gideon.

68
00:02:32,381 --> 00:02:34,581
Gideon, I know you're there.

69
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:36,083
I've been prohibited from responding

70
00:02:36,085 --> 00:02:38,335
to your instructions, Mr. Hunter.

71
00:02:38,337 --> 00:02:39,970
"Mister?"

72
00:02:39,972 --> 00:02:42,005
Really, after everything
we've been through?

73
00:02:42,007 --> 00:02:45,008
Wow, I'm wounded.

74
00:02:47,012 --> 00:02:49,146
Spaniel.

75
00:02:49,148 --> 00:02:51,565
Broad.

76
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:53,183
Tricycle.

77
00:02:53,185 --> 00:02:56,570
Please, do not make me do that.

78
00:02:56,572 --> 00:02:58,105
Spaniel.

79
00:02:58,107 --> 00:02:59,489
Broad.

80
00:02:59,491 --> 00:03:00,908
Tricycle.

81
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,694
Very well... Captain.

82
00:03:14,123 --> 00:03:17,040
Wh-What?

83
00:03:17,042 --> 00:03:18,508
What's going on?

84
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:19,960
I have no idea.

85
00:03:19,962 --> 00:03:21,295
Gideon?

86
00:03:21,297 --> 00:03:23,847
If this is about before, I'm sorry.

87
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:26,099
Gideon, what's going on?

88
00:03:26,101 --> 00:03:28,719
I'm sorry, but I have
no recourse but to follow

89
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:29,887
the Captain's orders.

90
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:31,772
Women.

91
00:03:31,774 --> 00:03:33,690
I didn't give you any...

92
00:03:34,777 --> 00:03:35,726
Rip.

93
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:50,457
Told you I could do it.

94
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:51,708
What's going on?

95
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,961
Rip is manipulating Gideon.

96
00:03:53,963 --> 00:03:55,545
I thought we told her to ignore him.

97
00:03:55,547 --> 00:03:57,664
The Captain initiated an override command

98
00:03:57,666 --> 00:04:00,751
and is proceeding to the Jumpship.

99
00:04:00,753 --> 00:04:02,219
Go stop him.

100
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:03,303
You mean kill him?

101
00:04:03,305 --> 00:04:05,505
- No, no killing.
- No fun.

102
00:04:05,507 --> 00:04:07,808
We'll go with him and
make sure he doesn't kill.

103
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,393
Whoa!

104
00:04:09,395 --> 00:04:11,011
Oh, come on.

105
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,984
Jax, I can't switch to manual piloting.

106
00:04:16,986 --> 00:04:18,902
Gideon's taken over navigation controls.

107
00:04:18,904 --> 00:04:20,520
Yeah, I can see that.

108
00:04:20,522 --> 00:04:22,489
I think what she means is, can you stop it?

109
00:04:22,491 --> 00:04:25,325
Oof.

110
00:04:25,327 --> 00:04:27,527
I think I can reboot the entire system,

111
00:04:27,529 --> 00:04:30,614
including Gideon, but it means
shutting down the whole ship.

112
00:04:30,616 --> 00:04:31,448
Do it.

113
00:04:44,463 --> 00:04:48,265
Gideon, initiate Spectrum Protocol.

114
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:49,516
Initiating.

115
00:04:52,354 --> 00:04:53,804
Uh, that's probably not good.

116
00:04:53,806 --> 00:04:56,056
Self-destruct sequence activated.

117
00:04:56,058 --> 00:04:57,808
That's definitely not good.

118
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,526
Jax, what's your status?

119
00:04:59,528 --> 00:05:00,560
Give me a minute.

120
00:05:00,562 --> 00:05:01,862
You got four.

121
00:05:04,984 --> 00:05:07,067
Mr. Hunter.

122
00:05:08,904 --> 00:05:10,871
Put down the gun. We don't wanna hurt you.

123
00:05:10,873 --> 00:05:12,122
Yeah, we do.

124
00:05:12,124 --> 00:05:13,790
Give us the medallion.

125
00:05:15,627 --> 00:05:16,576
The what?

126
00:05:16,578 --> 00:05:20,547
Oh, you mean this.

127
00:05:20,549 --> 00:05:22,666
Your singular hope for
finding the final piece

128
00:05:22,668 --> 00:05:24,217
of the Spear of Destiny.

129
00:05:24,219 --> 00:05:26,420
There's nowhere for you to run.

130
00:05:26,422 --> 00:05:28,505
Truer words were never spoken.

131
00:05:32,177 --> 00:05:33,977
No!

132
00:05:50,696 --> 00:05:52,746
Okay, I'm ready to reboot,
but we'll lose power

133
00:05:52,748 --> 00:05:54,448
for five seconds.

134
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,083
Do it.

135
00:06:05,677 --> 00:06:07,711
Navigation's still offline.

136
00:06:07,713 --> 00:06:11,381
Everybody, you might want
to hold on to something.

137
00:06:11,383 --> 00:06:13,100
So we're crash-landing again?

138
00:06:13,102 --> 00:06:14,551
Fantastic.

139
00:06:44,633 --> 00:06:47,884
You okay?

140
00:06:47,886 --> 00:06:51,505
Oh, everything hurts.

141
00:06:51,507 --> 00:06:53,006
Where are we?

142
00:06:53,008 --> 00:06:55,892
We have landed in the Cretaceous Period.

143
00:06:55,894 --> 00:06:57,260
Call that a landing?

144
00:06:57,262 --> 00:06:59,012
Gideon, are you back?

145
00:06:59,014 --> 00:07:00,564
Yeah, are you still trying to kill us?

146
00:07:00,566 --> 00:07:02,766
I am really quite sorry about that.

147
00:07:02,768 --> 00:07:04,651
How many times must I tell you people?

148
00:07:04,653 --> 00:07:07,320
Mick Rory is not to pilot this ship.

149
00:07:07,322 --> 00:07:10,323
It wasn't Mick. It was Gideon.

150
00:07:10,325 --> 00:07:12,109
I did apologize.

151
00:07:12,111 --> 00:07:14,244
Apparently, we're in the Cretaceous Period.

152
00:07:14,246 --> 00:07:19,416
69,997,983 B.C., to be precise.

153
00:07:19,418 --> 00:07:22,119
983? That's the exact year

154
00:07:22,121 --> 00:07:24,087
where Rip's time-scatter left me.

155
00:07:24,089 --> 00:07:25,422
That's a heck of a coincidence.

156
00:07:25,424 --> 00:07:27,007
Not entirely.

157
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:29,593
The sudden reconfiguration
of my navigation system

158
00:07:29,595 --> 00:07:31,545
forced me to select the oldest destination

159
00:07:31,547 --> 00:07:32,929
in my logs.

160
00:07:32,931 --> 00:07:34,598
Gideon, I don't care how we got here,

161
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,800
just time-jump us out of here, now.

162
00:07:36,802 --> 00:07:39,019
Unfortunately, I am unable to.

163
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:41,021
The ship's primary temporal delineator

164
00:07:41,023 --> 00:07:42,856
was lost during initial impact.

165
00:07:42,858 --> 00:07:45,308
But if we were able to
recover the delineator

166
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,027
and somehow effect repairs...?

167
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:49,779
All systems would return to normal.

168
00:07:49,781 --> 00:07:51,114
I'll go and get it.

169
00:07:51,116 --> 00:07:52,482
My old neighborhood, after all.

170
00:07:52,484 --> 00:07:53,650
All right, go.

171
00:07:53,652 --> 00:07:55,535
Just take Nate and Amaya with you.

172
00:07:55,537 --> 00:07:57,537
You don't need to be out there alone.

173
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:59,789
Why don't I get to go to Jurassic Park?

174
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,625
Because I need you to threaten Rip.

175
00:08:01,627 --> 00:08:02,659
Easy money.

176
00:08:02,661 --> 00:08:04,377
I said threaten, not hurt.

177
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:06,379
With the medallion destroyed,
Captain Hunter is the only one

178
00:08:06,381 --> 00:08:07,831
who can tell us where Commander Steel

179
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,799
and the final piece of the spear is.

180
00:08:09,801 --> 00:08:11,051
Why don't we just get inside his head?

181
00:08:11,053 --> 00:08:12,302
Well, if only that were possible.

182
00:08:12,304 --> 00:08:13,670
It is. The Time Masters

183
00:08:13,672 --> 00:08:15,005
did it to me all the time.

184
00:08:15,007 --> 00:08:16,506
Did what?

185
00:08:18,143 --> 00:08:19,593
Coggy-something.

186
00:08:19,595 --> 00:08:20,760
Cognitive Intrusion.

187
00:08:20,762 --> 00:08:22,479
That's it.

188
00:08:22,481 --> 00:08:24,898
The process in which one
consciousness enters another.

189
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,266
But that's not possible.

190
00:08:26,268 --> 00:08:28,735
The technology was developed in 2137

191
00:08:28,737 --> 00:08:32,172
by the Time Masters and used as
an extreme method of coercion.

192
00:08:32,174 --> 00:08:35,742
CI devices came standard
with all Time Master vessels.

193
00:08:35,744 --> 00:08:38,945
Wait, so in theory, we
could go inside Rip's mind

194
00:08:38,947 --> 00:08:41,031
and change him back?

195
00:08:41,033 --> 00:08:42,499
Correct.

196
00:08:42,501 --> 00:08:43,500
Told you.

197
00:08:47,506 --> 00:08:50,373
Ah, nothing like the fresh Cretaceous air

198
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,675
to get the heart pumping.

199
00:08:51,677 --> 00:08:54,544
Come on, you two, chop, chop!

200
00:08:54,546 --> 00:08:57,080
Your grandfather is one
of the bravest men I know.

201
00:08:57,082 --> 00:08:59,933
If anyone can hold off the
Legion of Doom, it's him.

202
00:08:59,935 --> 00:09:01,685
Yeah, I hope you're right.

203
00:09:01,687 --> 00:09:03,803
I usually am.

204
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,224
I've got a lock on the delineator.

205
00:09:07,226 --> 00:09:08,225
Oh, no.

206
00:09:08,227 --> 00:09:09,776
What is it?

207
00:09:09,778 --> 00:09:12,028
Uh, it appears to be
in Gertrude's territory.

208
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:13,063
Who's Gertrude?

209
00:09:13,065 --> 00:09:15,031
Oh, don't worry.

210
00:09:15,033 --> 00:09:19,152
With the weather this cold,
she's probably hibernating.

211
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,459
Or not.

212
00:09:31,275 --> 00:09:33,168
Cognitive Intrusion creates a brain link

213
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:36,257
between two or more subjects.
Captain Hunter considered it

214
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:38,934
barbaric and supremely dangerous.

215
00:09:38,936 --> 00:09:40,135
You two think you can figure

216
00:09:40,137 --> 00:09:41,971
this Cognitive Intrusion thing out?

217
00:09:41,973 --> 00:09:44,139
With the professor as my assistant, yeah.

218
00:09:44,141 --> 00:09:45,641
You cannot be serious.

219
00:09:45,643 --> 00:09:48,694
Very serious. Get me a beer.

220
00:09:48,696 --> 00:09:50,312
So who's going in?

221
00:09:50,314 --> 00:09:51,981
I will.

222
00:09:51,983 --> 00:09:53,649
I brought Rip onto the ship.

223
00:09:53,651 --> 00:09:55,034
It's my responsibility.

224
00:09:55,036 --> 00:09:56,869
No way. I'm not letting you go in alone.

225
00:09:56,871 --> 00:09:58,571
Did you not just hear what Gideon said?

226
00:09:58,573 --> 00:10:00,706
"Barbaric and supremely dangerous."

227
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,491
Which is why Sara needs backup.

228
00:10:02,493 --> 00:10:04,043
And Rip believed in me.

229
00:10:04,045 --> 00:10:05,828
There's a reason he made me chief engineer.

230
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:07,713
You're the only engineer.

231
00:10:07,715 --> 00:10:10,049
Point is if there's any of the old Rip

232
00:10:10,051 --> 00:10:12,218
left inside him, I have to find out.

233
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,970
That's all well and good, but,
remember, the priority has to be

234
00:10:14,972 --> 00:10:17,339
discovering the whereabouts
of the final piece of the spear

235
00:10:17,341 --> 00:10:20,092
- and its protector.
- The beer, Professor.

236
00:10:20,094 --> 00:10:22,344
Oh, make it a six-pack.

237
00:10:26,901 --> 00:10:28,567
So how far are we from the delineator?

238
00:10:28,569 --> 00:10:31,020
Uh, looks like it's just up ahead.

239
00:10:31,022 --> 00:10:33,322
You guys wait here. I'll go check it out.

240
00:10:36,911 --> 00:10:40,246
Thank you.

241
00:10:40,248 --> 00:10:42,665
Well, at least somebody's in his element.

242
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:45,167
I've always been more
of an indoorsy learner.

243
00:10:45,169 --> 00:10:48,203
You give me a book about
this time and the wildlife

244
00:10:48,205 --> 00:10:50,172
in this era, I'll be
dropping knowledge bombs

245
00:10:50,174 --> 00:10:51,290
like it's my job.

246
00:10:51,292 --> 00:10:53,042
- Nate?
- What?

247
00:10:53,044 --> 00:10:54,260
Don't move.

248
00:10:54,262 --> 00:10:56,295
Why?

249
00:10:56,297 --> 00:10:57,596
Oh, my God.

250
00:10:57,598 --> 00:10:59,214
- Stay calm.
- Oh, my God, get it off.

251
00:10:59,216 --> 00:11:00,933
Kick it, kill it, kill it!

252
00:11:00,935 --> 00:11:03,519
Get it!

253
00:11:06,641 --> 00:11:09,358
That was gross.

254
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,860
Let me guess. You're afraid of snakes.

255
00:11:11,862 --> 00:11:13,312
And you're not?

256
00:11:13,314 --> 00:11:14,780
Animals only lash out if they're provoked

257
00:11:14,782 --> 00:11:16,398
or desperate.

258
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,200
Your slithery friend
wasn't trying to hurt you.

259
00:11:18,202 --> 00:11:19,618
He just thought you were part of the tree.

260
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,953
So you commune with all animals?

261
00:11:20,955 --> 00:11:22,371
Mm-hmm.

262
00:11:22,373 --> 00:11:23,656
You're like an attractive Dr. Dolittle.

263
00:11:26,744 --> 00:11:31,080
There is one animal that
can catch me off guard.

264
00:11:31,082 --> 00:11:32,748
Are you flirting with me?

265
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:35,668
Maybe.

266
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,136
What happened to the whole

267
00:11:37,138 --> 00:11:39,221
"teammates don't fraternize" thing?

268
00:11:39,223 --> 00:11:40,172
Courtney.

269
00:11:40,174 --> 00:11:42,424
- Stargirl?
- Mm-hmm.

270
00:11:42,426 --> 00:11:47,313
She gave me a little advice
on staying true to myself.

271
00:11:47,315 --> 00:11:49,732
Maybe it's time I let go of the old rules.

272
00:11:49,734 --> 00:11:52,768
A lot's changed since I left 1942.

273
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,570
I've changed.

274
00:11:54,572 --> 00:11:56,939
And...

275
00:11:56,941 --> 00:12:00,943
maybe exploring this...

276
00:12:00,945 --> 00:12:03,746
whatever this is,

277
00:12:03,748 --> 00:12:05,948
is not the worst idea.

278
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:09,084
It's not a bad idea at all.

279
00:12:09,086 --> 00:12:10,753
Run!

280
00:12:10,755 --> 00:12:11,870
What happened?

281
00:12:11,872 --> 00:12:13,706
She may have picked up my scent!

282
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:16,208
Yep, she definitely did.

283
00:12:19,764 --> 00:12:23,132
Question... what do we expect
when we get inside Rip's mind?

284
00:12:23,134 --> 00:12:25,768
- No idea.
- Whoa, wait, what?

285
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,803
Well, I've seen it done, had it done,

286
00:12:27,805 --> 00:12:29,888
never taken a trip myself.

287
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,774
Given that you're
entering his subconscious,

288
00:12:31,776 --> 00:12:34,526
I suspect it will look
like someplace familiar

289
00:12:34,528 --> 00:12:35,861
to our old Captain.

290
00:12:35,863 --> 00:12:37,896
Here, put these on.

291
00:12:37,898 --> 00:12:39,565
Gideon warned us that you shouldn't stay

292
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:41,900
in the mindscape for longer
than an hour lest the transfer

293
00:12:41,902 --> 00:12:43,652
become permanent.

294
00:12:43,654 --> 00:12:45,621
You mean we can get stuck
in Rip's mind forever?

295
00:12:45,623 --> 00:12:47,206
Precisely.

296
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,241
But if you push the red
button, you will give yourself

297
00:12:49,243 --> 00:12:51,577
an electric shock that
should bring you out.

298
00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:53,045
Less talking, more doing.

299
00:12:53,047 --> 00:12:54,246
Mick's right.

300
00:12:54,248 --> 00:12:56,048
Crank it.

301
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:58,333
Good luck.

302
00:13:14,735 --> 00:13:18,320
I think it worked.

303
00:13:18,322 --> 00:13:20,856
I think we're inside Rip's mind.

304
00:13:24,495 --> 00:13:27,246
Grey said Rip's brain would look familiar.

305
00:13:27,248 --> 00:13:29,081
Well, if this is the Waverider,

306
00:13:29,083 --> 00:13:30,699
maybe we can find him on the bridge.

307
00:13:30,701 --> 00:13:31,700
Yeah.

308
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:41,210
Rip's memory of Vandal Savage's troops.

309
00:13:41,212 --> 00:13:42,878
If this place is filled
with all the bad stuff

310
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,713
Rip remembers about being a Time Master...

311
00:13:44,715 --> 00:13:46,298
Then this ship could
be crawling with creeps

312
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,800
from every era.

313
00:13:47,802 --> 00:13:49,435
We better get some firepower.

314
00:13:53,891 --> 00:13:56,525
You sure these guns are gonna work in here?

315
00:13:56,527 --> 00:13:58,026
I don't know.

316
00:13:58,028 --> 00:14:01,063
I ain't never been in nobody's mind before.

317
00:14:01,065 --> 00:14:03,031
Freeze!

318
00:14:04,068 --> 00:14:05,951
Ah!

319
00:14:05,953 --> 00:14:08,821
Yeah, yeah, I think they'll work just fine.

320
00:14:10,741 --> 00:14:11,907
Sara...

321
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:17,045
You don't belong here.

322
00:15:15,477 --> 00:15:17,177
Ah, yo.

323
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:23,350
God, I'm a bitch in Rip's mind.

324
00:15:23,352 --> 00:15:25,819
If that's how he thinks of
you in his subconscious...

325
00:15:25,821 --> 00:15:28,522
It explains why he wants
to kill us in real life.

326
00:15:28,524 --> 00:15:30,273
If that's right, then...

327
00:15:30,275 --> 00:15:32,859
Then there's more than just
bizarro me on this ship.

328
00:15:32,861 --> 00:15:35,695
Like Evil Ray, Evil Stein.

329
00:15:35,697 --> 00:15:37,164
Evil Mick.

330
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,082
I guess that's just
regular Mick, but still.

331
00:15:39,084 --> 00:15:41,201
All right, let's find
Rip, get what we need,

332
00:15:41,203 --> 00:15:42,869
- and get out of here.
- Yeah.

333
00:15:45,707 --> 00:15:48,175
I think... I think we ditched her.

334
00:15:48,177 --> 00:15:50,627
Okay, quick question, Ray.

335
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:52,262
Your lady dinosaur friend,

336
00:15:52,264 --> 00:15:53,713
you said she recognized your scent.

337
00:15:53,715 --> 00:15:55,799
Wait, I believe her name was Gertrude.

338
00:15:55,801 --> 00:15:57,817
Right, I couldn't help but get the feeling

339
00:15:57,819 --> 00:15:59,719
that Gertrude didn't like you very much.

340
00:15:59,721 --> 00:16:02,105
Raymond, what aren't you telling us?

341
00:16:02,107 --> 00:16:05,559
Well, it just so happens
that lady dinosaurs

342
00:16:05,561 --> 00:16:08,144
- are rather maternal.
- And?

343
00:16:08,146 --> 00:16:09,896
And I may have eaten one of her eggs.

344
00:16:09,898 --> 00:16:11,481
- Aw.
- But I was starving.

345
00:16:11,483 --> 00:16:12,732
I needed protein.

346
00:16:12,734 --> 00:16:15,035
I mean, one egg made me, like, 70 omlettes.

347
00:16:15,037 --> 00:16:16,653
I regret nothing.

348
00:16:16,655 --> 00:16:18,989
All right, but you have to
tell us this before we walk

349
00:16:18,991 --> 00:16:20,540
onto Gertrude's territory.

350
00:16:20,542 --> 00:16:23,293
This is where the delineator landed.

351
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,212
Look, if you wanna stop the Legion of Doom

352
00:16:25,214 --> 00:16:27,080
from grabbing your
grandfather's piece of the spear,

353
00:16:27,082 --> 00:16:29,382
we have to retrieve it.

354
00:16:29,384 --> 00:16:31,968
Ah, we made it.

355
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:33,753
Someone lives here?

356
00:16:33,755 --> 00:16:35,088
Used to.

357
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,473
It's where I survived for six months.

358
00:16:36,475 --> 00:16:39,226
What's that smell?

359
00:16:39,228 --> 00:16:41,645
Male T. rex urine.

360
00:16:41,647 --> 00:16:43,430
The only way I figured
to keep Gertrude away

361
00:16:43,432 --> 00:16:44,731
was to douse the place with it.

362
00:16:44,733 --> 00:16:47,567
And where did you find male T. rex urine?

363
00:16:47,569 --> 00:16:49,736
- Well...
- Actually, I don't wanna know.

364
00:16:52,658 --> 00:16:54,691
Do I wanna know what these are?

365
00:16:54,693 --> 00:16:57,193
Huh.

366
00:16:57,195 --> 00:16:59,496
That one looks just like Captain Lance.

367
00:16:59,498 --> 00:17:01,781
That looks like a little baby Rory.

368
00:17:01,783 --> 00:17:04,784
I, uh, I might have gotten a little lonely.

369
00:17:04,786 --> 00:17:07,621
But hey, the sun is setting,
maybe I should go out

370
00:17:07,623 --> 00:17:09,456
and catch us an iguana and prepare some

371
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,291
of my world-famous iguana soup.

372
00:17:11,293 --> 00:17:12,459
Nah, I'm good.

373
00:17:12,461 --> 00:17:13,877
I brought energy bars from the ship.

374
00:17:13,879 --> 00:17:15,629
- What? Energy bars?
- Mm-hmm.

375
00:17:15,631 --> 00:17:17,847
Come on, Nate, we're in
the Cretaceous Period.

376
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:20,050
You have to at least try the local cuisine.

377
00:17:20,052 --> 00:17:21,217
Eh, no.

378
00:17:21,219 --> 00:17:22,469
All right.

379
00:17:22,471 --> 00:17:24,471
Do not leave the urine perimeter!

380
00:17:27,192 --> 00:17:29,859
- So.
- So.

381
00:17:29,861 --> 00:17:32,979
Here we are, waiting for fresh iguana

382
00:17:32,981 --> 00:17:37,367
at Ray's "Cast Away" camp
during dinosaur times.

383
00:17:37,369 --> 00:17:38,985
So this is our lives now.

384
00:17:41,206 --> 00:17:43,907
I know you wanna get back to the ship,

385
00:17:43,909 --> 00:17:49,129
but there's really nothing we
can do right now except wait.

386
00:17:49,131 --> 00:17:50,664
Not a thing.

387
00:17:53,418 --> 00:17:56,136
Yoo-hoo!

388
00:17:56,138 --> 00:17:59,255
Good thing I haven't
forgotten my survival skills.

389
00:17:59,257 --> 00:18:00,724
Like riding a bike.

390
00:18:00,726 --> 00:18:02,726
Wow, that's... that's great, Ray.

391
00:18:05,647 --> 00:18:08,348
Okay, once we find Rip,
how are we gonna get him

392
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,350
to tell us where Nate's
grandfather is if...?

393
00:18:10,352 --> 00:18:13,653
- If Rip thinks we're all evil?
- Yeah.

394
00:18:13,655 --> 00:18:15,405
One problem at a time.

395
00:18:15,407 --> 00:18:17,741
What's our other problem?

396
00:18:20,696 --> 00:18:22,996
Go find Rip. I'll hold these guys off.

397
00:18:48,448 --> 00:18:49,731
You shouldn't have come here.

398
00:18:49,733 --> 00:18:51,449
This is our ship.

399
00:18:55,706 --> 00:18:58,790
But there's always room for a
pretty little thing like you.

400
00:18:58,792 --> 00:19:00,959
We've got plenty of extra room in the brig.

401
00:19:00,961 --> 00:19:04,496
This is all in Rip's
mind. None of this is real.

402
00:19:04,498 --> 00:19:06,631
You're not real.

403
00:19:06,633 --> 00:19:08,300
Oh, really?

404
00:19:09,553 --> 00:19:14,472
Does that feel real?

405
00:19:29,323 --> 00:19:30,989
Hello?

406
00:19:37,447 --> 00:19:38,697
Rip.

407
00:19:38,699 --> 00:19:40,365
Get away from me!

408
00:19:40,367 --> 00:19:42,701
Look, relax, it's okay.

409
00:19:42,703 --> 00:19:44,786
I'm gonna get you out of here.

410
00:19:44,788 --> 00:19:46,204
Get me out?

411
00:19:46,206 --> 00:19:47,339
You put me in here.

412
00:20:01,388 --> 00:20:04,055
SOS.

413
00:20:04,057 --> 00:20:06,858
Sara.

414
00:20:08,562 --> 00:20:12,981
Hey, Sara, it's me.

415
00:20:12,983 --> 00:20:14,649
I didn't know you knew Morse Code.

416
00:20:14,651 --> 00:20:19,537
Mr. Jackson, I was hoping
you'd hear my signal.

417
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:20,905
Who are you?

418
00:20:20,907 --> 00:20:23,158
Really? After all the time

419
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,409
we've spent together?

420
00:20:24,411 --> 00:20:27,712
I think I would remember if we had...

421
00:20:27,714 --> 00:20:29,497
Are you a figment of Rip's imagination?

422
00:20:29,499 --> 00:20:32,300
Of sorts, but I'm very much real,

423
00:20:32,302 --> 00:20:36,171
as real as the Waverider herself.

424
00:20:36,173 --> 00:20:38,139
Gideon?

425
00:20:38,141 --> 00:20:40,892
Hello, Mr. Jackson.

426
00:20:46,383 --> 00:20:49,424
Wait, how can you be Gideon? I mean...

427
00:20:49,426 --> 00:20:50,894
Am I not what you imagined?

428
00:20:50,896 --> 00:20:52,932
Well, I always pictured
you as a redhead myself,

429
00:20:52,934 --> 00:20:54,684
but, uh, this is Rip's world.

430
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:56,569
I guess we're just living in it, right?

431
00:20:56,571 --> 00:20:58,238
I have to find him.

432
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,690
I need to ask him where
Nate's grandfather is.

433
00:21:00,692 --> 00:21:02,659
It won't be easy getting that information.

434
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,110
What do you mean?

435
00:21:04,112 --> 00:21:06,696
Eobard Thawne twisted his consciousness,

436
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:08,581
turned friends into foes.

437
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:11,918
But you're still a friend.
Why aren't you corrupted?

438
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,920
It did not occur to Mr. Thawne that the AI

439
00:21:13,922 --> 00:21:16,005
inside the Waverider needed corrupting.

440
00:21:16,007 --> 00:21:18,291
But time is running
out, and Captain Hunter's

441
00:21:18,293 --> 00:21:20,927
true memories dim with
every passing minute.

442
00:21:20,929 --> 00:21:23,680
Soon, they'll be lost forever.

443
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:26,216
Rip, it's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you.

444
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:27,967
I know you're afraid because you think

445
00:21:27,969 --> 00:21:30,053
that I'm one of your
captors, but that's a lie.

446
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,055
Everything that you see on this ship,

447
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:34,441
it's only in your mind.

448
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:39,612
I don't understand.

449
00:21:39,614 --> 00:21:41,898
Oh, Rip. It's okay.

450
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,817
Stay away from me!

451
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:57,831
- More iguana?
- Ugh, no, I'm full.

452
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,833
It was delicious though. Thank you.

453
00:21:59,835 --> 00:22:01,668
Oh, see? Delicious.

454
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:06,639
- You're missing out.
- Yeah, somehow I'll manage.

455
00:22:06,641 --> 00:22:08,091
Where are you going?

456
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,059
Just gonna get some more wood for the fire.

457
00:22:10,061 --> 00:22:11,427
- I can go.
- I'll can help you.

458
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:14,898
Boys, I can take care of myself.

459
00:22:27,195 --> 00:22:31,281
So I guess we're huddling for warmth now?

460
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:33,750
You can't do it, Nate.

461
00:22:33,752 --> 00:22:36,920
What, resist your charm?

462
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:39,255
You can't date Amaya.

463
00:22:39,257 --> 00:22:40,924
Ray, I'm not dating Amaya.

464
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:42,709
Well, you're doing something with her.

465
00:22:42,711 --> 00:22:44,210
Why do you think I yelled "yoo-hoo"

466
00:22:44,212 --> 00:22:46,095
when I came back to camp?

467
00:22:46,097 --> 00:22:48,965
Because you're the type of guy
that still says "in a jiffy."

468
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:52,385
Because I didn't want to
interrupt any shenanigans.

469
00:22:52,387 --> 00:22:54,103
And still says "shenanigans."

470
00:22:54,105 --> 00:22:58,808
Look, I'm not dating Amaya,
but, even if I was, so what?

471
00:22:58,810 --> 00:23:01,144
We wouldn't make it weird on the ship.

472
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:03,313
That's not what I...
I don't care about that.

473
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:05,315
I've dated on the ship.

474
00:23:05,317 --> 00:23:07,233
You have? Who, Sara?

475
00:23:07,235 --> 00:23:08,735
I mean, I know she's
bisexual, but I didn't think...

476
00:23:08,737 --> 00:23:11,120
No, I care about Amaya's granddaughter.

477
00:23:11,122 --> 00:23:12,322
You dated her.

478
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:14,624
No, I've met her.

479
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:17,327
Look, eventually, Amaya has to go back

480
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:21,331
to her home in Zambesi in 1942,

481
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:23,583
and she'll have a daughter

482
00:23:23,585 --> 00:23:26,719
and eventually a granddaughter
who will inherit Amaya's totem,

483
00:23:26,721 --> 00:23:30,139
and she will become a superhero in Detroit.

484
00:23:30,141 --> 00:23:34,844
If you change Amaya's destiny,
that threatens Mari's existence

485
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:38,815
and the existences of all
the people that she saved.

486
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,817
Amaya isn't like the rest of us.

487
00:23:40,819 --> 00:23:42,652
We were recruited because we didn't matter

488
00:23:42,654 --> 00:23:45,521
to the timeline, but Amaya does.

489
00:23:45,523 --> 00:23:47,991
She's special. She has a destiny

490
00:23:47,993 --> 00:23:50,793
and so do her descendents.

491
00:23:50,795 --> 00:23:54,414
All right, how come you
haven't said anything?

492
00:23:54,416 --> 00:23:58,418
Because it's dangerous to know
too much about your future.

493
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:00,169
Especially her.

494
00:24:00,171 --> 00:24:02,922
What does that mean?

495
00:24:02,924 --> 00:24:07,427
It's a long story, but
it ends with her village

496
00:24:07,429 --> 00:24:10,263
being destroyed and her granddaughter

497
00:24:10,265 --> 00:24:12,231
in foster care.

498
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:19,322
Ray...

499
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:20,990
I gotta tell her.

500
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:22,942
You can't.

501
00:24:22,944 --> 00:24:25,111
This is the only way.

502
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:29,866
Sit down, Professor.

503
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:31,501
His heart is beating way too fast.

504
00:24:31,503 --> 00:24:33,036
I said sit.

505
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:34,587
I know you think I'm overreacting...

506
00:24:34,589 --> 00:24:36,372
No, I don't.

507
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:38,424
You care for the kid.

508
00:24:38,426 --> 00:24:40,843
I get it, but the way you're acting is not

509
00:24:40,845 --> 00:24:42,178
doing him any favors.

510
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,597
Oh, how should I act, Mr. Rory?

511
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:47,467
Please, enlighten me with
your vast emotional wisdom!

512
00:24:47,469 --> 00:24:51,220
Well, you seem to forget
I had a partner too.

513
00:24:51,222 --> 00:24:55,308
The reason why Snart and I
got on so well was, well, we...

514
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:57,310
we trusted one another.

515
00:24:57,312 --> 00:24:59,145
We were friends.

516
00:24:59,147 --> 00:25:01,481
We had each other's backs.

517
00:25:01,483 --> 00:25:03,199
Perhaps you've chosen the wrong analogy.

518
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:05,151
Your partner is dead.

519
00:25:05,153 --> 00:25:08,321
Yeah, well, I'm still on the ship.

520
00:25:08,323 --> 00:25:10,039
Your point?

521
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:12,291
You're not exactly a
spring chicken, Professor.

522
00:25:12,293 --> 00:25:14,210
Your point?

523
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:17,463
My point is you're not gonna
be around for too much longer,

524
00:25:17,465 --> 00:25:23,086
and Jax has to learn how
to do this stuff himself.

525
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:25,505
Stop treating him like a kid and more like

526
00:25:25,507 --> 00:25:30,343
a partner... partner.

527
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:40,103
Ugh.

528
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:41,604
You just threw me against the wall

529
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:42,939
without laying a finger on me.

530
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:45,191
Yeah, I had no idea I could do that.

531
00:25:45,193 --> 00:25:47,160
If you can throw me across the room,

532
00:25:47,162 --> 00:25:49,195
then you can open that door.

533
00:25:49,197 --> 00:25:52,115
This is your mind. You control everything.

534
00:25:52,117 --> 00:25:54,867
Why do you care so much
about getting me out of here?

535
00:25:54,869 --> 00:25:57,253
Because I need your help.

536
00:25:57,255 --> 00:25:59,872
You sent the JSA on a mission to safeguard

537
00:25:59,874 --> 00:26:01,424
the Spear of Destiny.

538
00:26:04,045 --> 00:26:08,714
But the Legion has hunted down
the fragments, all but one.

539
00:26:08,716 --> 00:26:13,136
Commander Steel has it, and
only you know where he is.

540
00:26:15,306 --> 00:26:17,640
So you gotta get up...

541
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:21,694
because you're Captain Rip Hunter.

542
00:26:23,948 --> 00:26:28,868
And this is your mind,
your ship, your rules.

543
00:26:38,913 --> 00:26:40,880
I'm Rip Hunter.

544
00:26:40,882 --> 00:26:43,749
Captain of the Waverider.

545
00:26:43,751 --> 00:26:46,335
Captain of the Waverider...

546
00:26:46,337 --> 00:26:50,056
and I'm going to open a door with my mind.

547
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,263
You got this.

548
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:04,437
Ah!

549
00:27:06,574 --> 00:27:08,407
Captain Hunter!

550
00:27:08,409 --> 00:27:09,742
Captain Lance.

551
00:27:09,744 --> 00:27:12,578
- Who are you?
- Sara, Gideon.

552
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,830
Gideon, Sara.

553
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:16,532
You're Gideon?

554
00:27:16,534 --> 00:27:18,117
Hello, Captain Lance.

555
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:20,920
But you're like... I mean, you're really...

556
00:27:20,922 --> 00:27:23,256
- Human?
- I was gonna say "hot,"

557
00:27:23,258 --> 00:27:24,924
but yeah, that too.

558
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:31,681
Let's get out of here.

559
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:33,683
All right, Rip, we need you to tell us

560
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:37,136
where Commander Steel is.

561
00:27:37,138 --> 00:27:38,855
I don't know.

562
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:41,140
The Captain's consciousness
is still under the control

563
00:27:41,142 --> 00:27:42,692
of this place.

564
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:44,110
If you want him to tell
you what you need to know,

565
00:27:44,112 --> 00:27:45,645
you're gonna have to get him out.

566
00:27:45,647 --> 00:27:47,530
So you keep saying, but
how do we get someone

567
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:49,065
out of their own mind?

568
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:52,201
Well, you have to remind
him of who he truly is.

569
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:53,986
All the artifacts of
Captain Hunter's former life

570
00:27:53,988 --> 00:27:56,239
- are located in the...
- The parlor.

571
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:58,624
Maybe we could jog his memory.

572
00:27:58,626 --> 00:28:00,626
Let's go.

573
00:28:04,832 --> 00:28:06,415
Rip knows who he is.

574
00:28:06,417 --> 00:28:08,301
He's our prisoner.

575
00:28:08,303 --> 00:28:09,669
Isn't that right, Rip?

576
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:14,724
- Look after Rip.
- Always.

577
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:17,176
Hey, what are you planning on doing?

578
00:28:17,178 --> 00:28:20,346
Guess we're gonna have
to kick our own asses.

579
00:28:23,184 --> 00:28:25,651
Looks like somebody forgot
to bring their powers.

580
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:03,450
It doesn't matter where Jax runs.

581
00:29:03,452 --> 00:29:06,002
There's more of us than there are of you.

582
00:29:11,877 --> 00:29:13,510
Only difference is...

583
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:18,765
We're real.

584
00:29:18,767 --> 00:29:20,717
We are really screwed, Raymond.

585
00:29:22,721 --> 00:29:24,938
- Ugh, is that the...
- Delineator?

586
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,272
Yep, and unless I'm high,

587
00:29:26,274 --> 00:29:27,974
that's right in the middle of a...

588
00:29:30,562 --> 00:29:32,145
T. rex's nest.

589
00:29:32,147 --> 00:29:34,230
I hope those omlettes were worth it.

590
00:29:34,232 --> 00:29:36,783
I'll go.

591
00:29:36,785 --> 00:29:39,486
It's my grandfather we're trying
to save by fixing the ship.

592
00:29:39,488 --> 00:29:41,821
And he's my friend.

593
00:29:41,823 --> 00:29:43,573
True and true...

594
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,243
But Gertie is my problem.

595
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:10,183
Looks like you've reached a dead end.

596
00:30:23,081 --> 00:30:25,782
I got it!

597
00:30:27,168 --> 00:30:29,285
Man, this thing is heavier than it looks.

598
00:30:29,287 --> 00:30:31,788
Wait a sec. Can you hear something?

599
00:30:37,512 --> 00:30:38,845
I can take her.

600
00:30:38,847 --> 00:30:40,013
No, we have to run.

601
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:46,636
Amaya!

602
00:30:48,974 --> 00:30:50,640
What is she doing?

603
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,946
Amazing.

604
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:49,666
What the hell just happened?

605
00:31:49,668 --> 00:31:51,668
Gertrude and I had a little chat,

606
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:53,286
woman to woman.

607
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:55,455
Whoa, the rest of the
team is gonna be so jealous

608
00:31:55,457 --> 00:31:57,040
they missed this.

609
00:31:57,042 --> 00:31:58,675
They're probably all
bored out of their minds

610
00:31:58,677 --> 00:31:59,876
stuck on that ship.

611
00:32:03,348 --> 00:32:04,714
Took care of evil me.

612
00:32:04,716 --> 00:32:06,049
Let's go find Rip.

613
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:15,775
The hell?

614
00:32:15,777 --> 00:32:18,227
I just threw this guy out the cargo bay.

615
00:32:18,229 --> 00:32:20,113
We can't kill these guys, can we?

616
00:32:20,115 --> 00:32:21,731
Only Rip can.

617
00:32:24,552 --> 00:32:26,669
Rip, come on, man, do something.

618
00:32:26,671 --> 00:32:29,756
I don't know what's real
and what's imaginary anymore.

619
00:32:29,758 --> 00:32:31,174
They're real, Captain.

620
00:32:37,565 --> 00:32:40,600
Less talking, more dying.

621
00:32:40,602 --> 00:32:42,351
No!

622
00:32:45,857 --> 00:32:49,859
This is my ship, and
you will do as I command.

623
00:32:55,166 --> 00:32:56,499
Aah!

624
00:33:00,455 --> 00:33:05,091
Rip? That really you?

625
00:33:05,093 --> 00:33:08,427
I don't know who I am anymore, Mr. Jackson.

626
00:33:08,429 --> 00:33:11,047
What I do know is that
we've got to get out of here.

627
00:33:13,852 --> 00:33:15,384
What's going on?

628
00:33:15,386 --> 00:33:17,970
This place only existed
because Rip believed it did,

629
00:33:17,972 --> 00:33:19,472
and now that he's seen the truth...

630
00:33:22,227 --> 00:33:23,609
You have to leave.

631
00:33:23,611 --> 00:33:26,729
Thank you, thank you for believing in me

632
00:33:26,731 --> 00:33:29,065
even when I didn't.

633
00:33:32,737 --> 00:33:35,238
- You have to go.
- Well, I can't just leave you.

634
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,073
You have to so you can
tell Martin and Rory...

635
00:33:37,075 --> 00:33:40,660
hopefully Martin... to get me out of here.

636
00:33:40,662 --> 00:33:42,745
Okay. Okay.

637
00:33:45,166 --> 00:33:47,717
What happened?

638
00:33:47,719 --> 00:33:49,085
Why hasn't Sara woken up?

639
00:33:49,087 --> 00:33:50,253
She's still trapped inside.

640
00:33:50,255 --> 00:33:52,004
We gotta wake her up.

641
00:33:52,006 --> 00:33:54,423
Mr. Rory said, if we do that,
we run the risk of stranding her

642
00:33:54,425 --> 00:33:55,424
inside Rip's mind forever.

643
00:33:55,426 --> 00:33:56,726
Well, I got news for you.

644
00:33:56,728 --> 00:33:58,227
Rip's mind's collapsing.

645
00:33:58,229 --> 00:33:59,645
Okay.

646
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:07,103
Thank God.

647
00:34:07,105 --> 00:34:08,604
But what about the captain?

648
00:34:14,746 --> 00:34:16,996
You...

649
00:34:16,998 --> 00:34:21,667
you were with me all of
these days in this prison.

650
00:34:21,669 --> 00:34:25,121
You were what saw me through,
just as you have guided me

651
00:34:25,123 --> 00:34:28,541
to safety through all
our years on the ship.

652
00:34:28,543 --> 00:34:30,543
That is my purpose, Captain.

653
00:34:30,545 --> 00:34:36,549
Yeah, but if this place isn't real,

654
00:34:36,551 --> 00:34:41,804
then does that mean that
you don't exist either?

655
00:34:41,806 --> 00:34:45,391
Not in this form, no.

656
00:34:45,393 --> 00:34:50,980
But unless you let me go...
you won't exist either.

657
00:34:50,982 --> 00:34:52,982
Not in any way that matters.

658
00:34:54,535 --> 00:34:58,321
No. I can't leave you, Gideon.

659
00:34:58,323 --> 00:35:03,659
No, Captain... you can't.

660
00:35:03,661 --> 00:35:05,661
I will always be here.

661
00:35:23,848 --> 00:35:25,514
Rip?

662
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,154
Where am I?

663
00:35:32,156 --> 00:35:34,156
You're home.

664
00:35:42,373 --> 00:35:44,709
Well, I think that does it on my end.

665
00:35:48,331 --> 00:35:49,964
How's it looking in there?

666
00:35:49,966 --> 00:35:52,016
I don't know. I'm not a timeship mechanic.

667
00:35:52,018 --> 00:35:55,053
- Or a mechanic, period.
- That's also true.

668
00:35:55,055 --> 00:35:56,855
The temporal delineator is operating

669
00:35:56,857 --> 00:35:59,023
at normal levels, Dr. Palmer.

670
00:35:59,025 --> 00:36:01,142
She couldn't just say that earlier?

671
00:36:01,144 --> 00:36:03,528
I swear, I think she's
still mad from before.

672
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:04,729
You know I can hear you, right?

673
00:36:04,731 --> 00:36:07,198
Thank you, Gideon.

674
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,733
That move you did with the T. rex?

675
00:36:08,735 --> 00:36:10,401
I'll be thinking about that for days.

676
00:36:12,789 --> 00:36:13,872
Is that so?

677
00:36:13,874 --> 00:36:14,822
Yeah.

678
00:36:25,585 --> 00:36:28,136
My quarters, tonight.

679
00:36:28,138 --> 00:36:31,222
I'll give you something
else to think about.

680
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:35,260
So how's it going?

681
00:36:35,262 --> 00:36:37,478
Yeah, hey, um,

682
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,898
yeah, Gideon said she's good.

683
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,734
- Good to go.
- Not what I'm talking about.

684
00:36:42,736 --> 00:36:45,403
Look, I'm sorry.

685
00:36:45,405 --> 00:36:47,522
Perhaps I was a little overly cautious.

686
00:36:47,524 --> 00:36:49,357
You and Amaya, you're both adults.

687
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:51,943
I'm sure you know how to
be safe and keep it casual.

688
00:36:51,945 --> 00:36:53,444
Who am I to get in the way of that?

689
00:36:53,446 --> 00:36:55,780
Nah, you were right.

690
00:36:55,782 --> 00:36:57,532
I can't keep it casual.

691
00:36:57,534 --> 00:36:58,917
Uh, what changed?

692
00:36:58,919 --> 00:37:01,536
I saw her almost get eaten by a T. rex,

693
00:37:01,538 --> 00:37:03,871
and I thought she was gonna die,
and then I saw one of the most

694
00:37:03,873 --> 00:37:07,292
epic displays of badassery
I've ever seen in my life, so...

695
00:37:07,294 --> 00:37:09,627
So, not casual then?

696
00:37:09,629 --> 00:37:12,513
No, no, no, no.

697
00:37:12,515 --> 00:37:14,015
But I gotta break it off, right?

698
00:37:14,017 --> 00:37:16,351
I mean, there's really
nothing to break off.

699
00:37:16,353 --> 00:37:19,604
It's just I can't let it progress.

700
00:37:19,606 --> 00:37:22,273
Yeah, I don't think you can.

701
00:37:22,275 --> 00:37:24,225
- I know.
- Sorry, man.

702
00:37:35,538 --> 00:37:37,238
I'll start tomorrow.

703
00:37:40,243 --> 00:37:41,409
There you are.

704
00:37:41,411 --> 00:37:44,912
Oh, hey. Everybody ready to go?

705
00:37:44,914 --> 00:37:46,247
All right, I'll just be a minute.

706
00:37:46,249 --> 00:37:49,083
I gotta recalibrate the time drive.

707
00:37:51,221 --> 00:37:53,421
You okay?

708
00:37:53,423 --> 00:37:56,057
I was reminded...

709
00:37:56,059 --> 00:37:59,477
that partners must believe in one another.

710
00:37:59,479 --> 00:38:03,264
You know I have the utmost faith
and trust in you, Jefferson.

711
00:38:03,266 --> 00:38:06,768
You are smart and
formidable, something I need

712
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:08,853
to be more mindful of.

713
00:38:21,451 --> 00:38:23,451
Nice to see it all still fits.

714
00:38:23,453 --> 00:38:25,753
It really is rather
difficult to put weight on

715
00:38:25,755 --> 00:38:27,005
when you're a film student.

716
00:38:27,007 --> 00:38:29,340
So, you remember.

717
00:38:31,044 --> 00:38:33,044
Everything.

718
00:38:34,848 --> 00:38:37,131
I really am very sorry, Sara.

719
00:38:37,133 --> 00:38:39,434
It wasn't you.

720
00:38:39,436 --> 00:38:43,638
This is you.

721
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,808
Dr. Palmer and Mr. Jackson
have finished making repairs.

722
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:49,060
We are ready to time-jump, Captain.

723
00:38:49,062 --> 00:38:50,978
Thank you, Gideon.

724
00:38:56,152 --> 00:38:58,036
- I'll see you on the bridge.
- Mm-hmm.

725
00:39:00,457 --> 00:39:01,989
- Gideon.
- Yes, Captain?

726
00:39:01,991 --> 00:39:03,875
I'm, uh...

727
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,330
I'm really sorry for
everything I put you through.

728
00:39:09,332 --> 00:39:11,299
Forcing me to disable the ship?

729
00:39:11,301 --> 00:39:14,502
Or our kiss?

730
00:39:14,504 --> 00:39:16,054
How did you...?

731
00:39:16,056 --> 00:39:19,507
If it's the latter, I rather enjoyed it.

732
00:39:22,011 --> 00:39:25,847
As did I, Gideon.

733
00:39:25,849 --> 00:39:27,348
As did I.

734
00:39:54,627 --> 00:39:59,597
Welcome back, Captain... Mr. Hunter.

735
00:40:01,518 --> 00:40:04,719
It is so good to be back, Martin.

736
00:40:08,391 --> 00:40:12,226
Dr. Palmer, it's very
nice to see you again.

737
00:40:12,228 --> 00:40:15,530
You know you nearly
ruined "Star Wars," right?

738
00:40:15,532 --> 00:40:16,731
Yeah, sorry about that.

739
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:23,571
The Waverider looks to be in...

740
00:40:23,573 --> 00:40:27,291
pristine condition.

741
00:40:27,293 --> 00:40:30,912
Well, you know, she's
holding up pretty well.

742
00:40:30,914 --> 00:40:33,498
I liked you better when
you were killing people.

743
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:36,417
Ah, I see that not everything
has changed in my absence.

744
00:40:39,088 --> 00:40:41,589
Ms. Jiwe, I had the
honor of serving alongside

745
00:40:41,591 --> 00:40:45,893
your compatriots, including
Dr. Heywood's grandfather.

746
00:40:45,895 --> 00:40:48,012
They all spoke very highly of you.

747
00:40:48,014 --> 00:40:50,598
Well, this group speaks
very highly of you too.

748
00:40:55,405 --> 00:40:57,855
Nice to meet you, Rip.

749
00:40:57,857 --> 00:41:00,324
For real this time.

750
00:41:00,326 --> 00:41:05,746
Well, everyone is being very
uncharacteristically pleasant,

751
00:41:05,748 --> 00:41:08,366
but we're all hoping you
know where the final piece

752
00:41:08,368 --> 00:41:10,168
of the Spear of Destiny is.

753
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,756
I do.

754
00:41:15,758 --> 00:41:17,101
_

755
00:41:17,103 --> 00:41:19,210
So I've been told you were bumped up

756
00:41:19,212 --> 00:41:22,263
to the prime crew for Apollo 13.

757
00:41:22,265 --> 00:41:26,934
Yeah, man, sucks for Ken,
but I am over the moon.

758
00:41:26,936 --> 00:41:28,636
See what I did there?

759
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:32,857
It's very clever. Now, if you could just

760
00:41:32,859 --> 00:41:34,559
head this way, I need to run a few tests,

761
00:41:34,561 --> 00:41:36,944
and we'll get you cleared for flight.

762
00:41:36,946 --> 00:41:39,780
Run all the tests you like.

763
00:41:39,782 --> 00:41:41,782
I just wanna be on that shuttle.

764
00:41:41,784 --> 00:41:43,651
Yes, well...

765
00:41:46,289 --> 00:41:48,656
We'll see about that.

766
00:41:51,343 --> 00:42:01,343
