1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074


2
00:00:32,058 --> 00:00:34,144
Murphy, join t' party, huh?

3
00:00:38,564 --> 00:00:40,025
What's wrong?

4
00:00:40,108 --> 00:00:42,235
All you guys having a good time?

5
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:44,904
You gotta let it go, man.
There's good that came out of this.

6
00:00:45,822 --> 00:00:47,866
Yeah, we used him,
then we got him killed.

7
00:00:47,949 --> 00:00:50,702
No, we didn't kill him... Escobar did.

8
00:00:50,785 --> 00:00:53,163
And now we get to go after
that motherfucker.

9
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:56,457
Look on the bright side, huh?

10
00:00:58,043 --> 00:01:01,380
Peña was right.
There was a silver lining.

11
00:01:02,588 --> 00:01:05,884
One of the sicarios caught
after Lara Bonilla's assassination

12
00:01:05,967 --> 00:01:08,303
confessed that Pablo had put out the hit.

13
00:01:10,555 --> 00:01:14,684
An important politician had been murdered
and everyone knew who did it.

14
00:01:15,852 --> 00:01:18,355
Finally, the Colombian government
had to react.

15
00:01:19,398 --> 00:01:22,483
Pablo Escobar was indicted
for the murder of Rodrigo Lara Bonilla.

16
00:01:22,567 --> 00:01:24,403
PABLO ESCOBAR GAVIRIA
$100,000 REWARD

17
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:29,657
Colombia agreed to the one thing
extradition.

18
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:33,412
Now any Colombian
who smuggled drugs to America

19
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:35,914
could be prosecuted
and jailed in the US,

20
00:01:35,997 --> 00:01:38,499
even if they never
stepped foot on our soil.

21
00:01:39,542 --> 00:01:41,836
This made all the difference in the world.

22
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,839
If you were a narco in Colombia,

23
00:01:44,923 --> 00:01:47,759
jail time meant banging girls,
watching movies,

24
00:01:47,967 --> 00:01:49,552
hanging with the fellas...

25
00:01:49,635 --> 00:01:53,639
Grease the right hands and you'd
get a reduced sentence for good behavior.

26
00:01:53,723 --> 00:01:55,558
It was a fucking joke.

27
00:01:55,767 --> 00:01:58,144
Back home,
it was a whole different deal.

28
00:01:58,228 --> 00:02:02,023
The seventh richest man in the world?
No one gives a shit.

29
00:02:02,107 --> 00:02:06,403
You still get a 6x8 cell 23 hours a day,
just like every other loser,

30
00:02:06,486 --> 00:02:08,029
a fucking nightmare.

31
00:02:08,238 --> 00:02:11,950
Us.

32
00:03:43,749 --> 00:03:46,669
Extradition doesn't mean anything
unless you can catch him.

33
00:03:46,752 --> 00:03:49,297
- With our help, you will.
- Oh, that's right.

34
00:03:49,381 --> 00:03:50,882
Gringos to the rescue.

35
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,719
It's one fucking man
against the United States of America.

36
00:03:54,927 --> 00:03:59,265
One man with helicopters, airplanes,
vehicles, planned escape routes,

37
00:03:59,474 --> 00:04:02,101
- and a network of informants.
- Our government will provide money,

38
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,604
- men, weapons...
- You make it sound so easy.

39
00:04:05,397 --> 00:04:08,733
But Escobar has always
managed to stay one step ahead of us.

40
00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:11,236
Help us catch him.

41
00:04:12,362 --> 00:04:15,323
I'll never be assigned to this.
Jaramillo hates my guts.

42
00:04:15,407 --> 00:04:16,991
Let me take care of that.

43
00:04:19,077 --> 00:04:21,954
- You think extradition's a victory.
- It is.

44
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,547
Escobar will not go lightly.

45
00:04:33,425 --> 00:04:36,010
He will make Colombia bleed.

46
00:04:39,514 --> 00:04:42,642
Now more than ever
is the time for solidarity.

47
00:04:43,809 --> 00:04:47,313
You make the mistakes,
and then you preach solidarity?

48
00:04:47,397 --> 00:04:49,732
- Shut up, fag.
- What the fuck, Carlos?

49
00:04:51,276 --> 00:04:52,902
Why are you always defending him?

50
00:04:52,985 --> 00:04:54,946
Did he get your sister back
for you or not?

51
00:04:55,154 --> 00:04:58,824
We rescued her because we did it together.
Right?

52
00:05:03,413 --> 00:05:04,789
Gentlemen...

53
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,919
I suggest we form another organization

54
00:05:10,002 --> 00:05:13,423
to fight against
the injustice of extradition.

55
00:05:13,506 --> 00:05:15,716
Like John Lennon said,

56
00:05:15,925 --> 00:05:19,262
- "Come together, brothers and sisters... "
- Stop that fag shit right now.

57
00:05:20,763 --> 00:05:22,474
So Jorge...

58
00:05:23,433 --> 00:05:24,601
what will we call it?

59
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:28,938
First, "Death to Kidnappers,"
then "the Extraditables."

60
00:05:29,147 --> 00:05:34,360
Once again, the narcos were united
jail in America.

61
00:05:34,444 --> 00:05:38,072
But it was not quite like
"one for all, and all for one."

62
00:05:41,033 --> 00:05:42,827
It was more like each man for himself.

63
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:44,329
Next!

64
00:05:44,412 --> 00:05:48,541
Gacha, being Gacha, decided that
all he had to do to defeat extradition

65
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:52,671
- was kill anyone who tried to arrest him.
- Fire!

66
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:56,007
So he hired a bunch of
Israeli mercenaries and prepared for war.

67
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:56,924
Next!

68
00:05:57,133 --> 00:06:00,886
Lehder, being Lehder, got high as a kite
and took to the airwaves.

69
00:06:01,095 --> 00:06:04,349
The gringos
are the ones who use the drugs.

70
00:06:05,725 --> 00:06:08,811
So why are we the ones
who need to be extradited?

71
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:11,022
I'm not sure how helpful that was.

72
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:13,941
I mean, all of our problems...

73
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:18,321
are because of those imperialist gringos!

74
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,948
No, stay there... stay there.

75
00:06:21,032 --> 00:06:24,994
As for the Ochoa brothers,
they went with a fancy PR firm

76
00:06:25,077 --> 00:06:28,623
and got ripped off because, well...
that's what PR agencies do.

77
00:06:28,831 --> 00:06:30,833
"Better a grave in Colombia

78
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,377
than a grave in the United States."

79
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:36,422
No, I've got it, Fabio, I've got it.
Let's see...

80
00:06:36,631 --> 00:06:41,052
"Better a grave in Colombia
than a cell in the United States."

81
00:06:41,135 --> 00:06:42,595
- What do you think?
- I love it.

82
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:45,014
Very good.

83
00:06:45,097 --> 00:06:48,518
And for $50,000 more,
we'll make your logo.

84
00:06:49,227 --> 00:06:50,603
Done.

85
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,693
By the way,
here's the logo $50,000 got you.

86
00:06:56,776 --> 00:07:00,446
In the upcoming presidential election,
extradition became the defining issue

87
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:01,864
amongst the candidates.

88
00:07:01,947 --> 00:07:04,534
Those the narcos could buy,
they bought.

89
00:07:04,743 --> 00:07:06,827
The ones they could scare,
they scared.

90
00:07:07,036 --> 00:07:09,789
But Luis Carlos Galán was neither.

91
00:07:09,997 --> 00:07:13,876
And so, unable to buy him
and unable to scare him,

92
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:17,171
Escobar tried out
that fancy new stationery,

93
00:07:17,255 --> 00:07:19,173
and he wrote Galán a letter.

94
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,970
"And to conclude, I want
to express my most energetic protest"

95
00:07:25,054 --> 00:07:27,766
over the improper interference
of North America

96
00:07:27,848 --> 00:07:30,727
in a way that entails
the most flagrant violation

97
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:32,853
"of the sovereignty of our Motherland."

98
00:07:33,772 --> 00:07:35,565
He's got some balls.

99
00:07:35,774 --> 00:07:37,358
Escobar is shameless.

100
00:07:37,442 --> 00:07:42,029
The United States is inclined to support
your bid for the presidency, Mr. Galán.

101
00:07:42,113 --> 00:07:45,157
But even if we indict these narcos
in the United States,

102
00:07:45,241 --> 00:07:48,119
we still can't get them there
without Colombian approval.

103
00:07:48,202 --> 00:07:51,080
We're curious
as to your view on extradition.

104
00:07:52,331 --> 00:07:54,041
My campaign manager,
Dr. Gaviria,

105
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,586
doesn't want me
to stick my foot in my mouth.

106
00:07:57,462 --> 00:08:00,673
America wants Pablo Escobar
to prove they're winning a battle,

107
00:08:00,757 --> 00:08:03,468
when clearly,
they're losing a war.

108
00:08:04,385 --> 00:08:06,512
I'll do what's best for Colombia.

109
00:08:08,389 --> 00:08:11,892
If you speak in favor
of extradition, you will be their puppet,

110
00:08:11,976 --> 00:08:14,312
and that will be your death sentence.

111
00:08:14,395 --> 00:08:18,650
I don't care about the Americans, but I am
still going to support extradition.

112
00:08:18,733 --> 00:08:21,986
Besides, if the gringos want to take away
all the goddamn killers of this country,

113
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:23,404
then let them take them.

114
00:08:23,488 --> 00:08:24,989
Since he couldn't get to Galán,

115
00:08:25,197 --> 00:08:27,826
Pablo reached out
to many of the country's judges.

116
00:08:28,033 --> 00:08:30,745
He figured out that a sanctioned law
would do no harm

117
00:08:30,829 --> 00:08:32,955
if no judge was willing to apply it.

118
00:08:34,999 --> 00:08:37,627
"As you pass judgment
on one of our sons"

119
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:40,963
and consider sending him
to his fate in the United States,

120
00:08:41,046 --> 00:08:44,425
know we, the Extraditables,
will pass judgment on you

121
00:08:44,509 --> 00:08:47,094
"and bring a sentence far harsher."

122
00:08:47,178 --> 00:08:49,472
The judges were so scared and intimidated

123
00:08:49,555 --> 00:08:52,308
that special court procedures
had to be created.

124
00:08:52,391 --> 00:08:54,853
For the first time
in the history of Colombia,

125
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:57,814
it was the good guys who
had to hide their faces behind the masks.

126
00:08:58,022 --> 00:08:59,649
Defendants, please rise.

127
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,196
You've been tried and convicted
of cocaine trafficking.

128
00:09:05,404 --> 00:09:12,203
You will immediately be turned over to the
DEA for extradition to the United States.

129
00:09:12,286 --> 00:09:15,623
Despite his threats,
many brave men defied him.

130
00:09:17,917 --> 00:09:21,253
And true to form,
when the pen failed...

131
00:09:21,337 --> 00:09:23,339
Pablo was always ready with the sword.

132
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:32,348
In light of this terrorism,
you'd think that everyone in Colombia

133
00:09:32,431 --> 00:09:36,268
would've made catching Escobar
the number one priority, right?

134
00:09:36,352 --> 00:09:37,770
Well, guess again.

135
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:41,733
Communists. They're the real threat
to the security of this country.

136
00:09:41,816 --> 00:09:45,444
All due respect, but Colombian cocaine has
killed more Americans than Soviet troops.

137
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:49,240
We got FARC, we got M-19,
we got EPL, we got ELN,

138
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:51,868
all supported by the Soviets and Cubans.

139
00:09:51,951 --> 00:09:55,705
Sorry, Agent Peña, but our resources
gotta be directed at America's problems,

140
00:09:55,788 --> 00:09:58,082
and you don't get to tell us
what those are.

141
00:09:59,124 --> 00:10:02,086
Communists. Remember them?

142
00:10:02,837 --> 00:10:06,591
With Reagan in the White House,
it was hard to forget.

143
00:10:06,674 --> 00:10:07,717
In his words:

144
00:10:07,926 --> 00:10:10,929
They are the focus of evil
in the modern world.

145
00:10:11,136 --> 00:10:15,307
The Soviet evil empire
was Reagan's thing, always had been.

146
00:10:15,516 --> 00:10:18,937
In Hollywood, he named some actors
as communist sympathizers.

147
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:22,022
In Washington,
he created the Reagan Doctrine,

148
00:10:22,106 --> 00:10:24,776
which opposed Soviet-backed communists
all over the world.

149
00:10:25,902 --> 00:10:28,320
Drug traffickers just didn't rate.

150
00:10:28,404 --> 00:10:31,991
You want to turn on the tap
of the richest country in the world,

151
00:10:32,074 --> 00:10:33,242
you'd better be chasing reds.

152
00:10:33,451 --> 00:10:36,829
Ambassador, if the CIA
and the Mil Group provide assets,

153
00:10:36,913 --> 00:10:38,873
the Colombians will get Escobar.

154
00:10:38,957 --> 00:10:42,001
We're talking about a huge blow
to the cocaine trade

155
00:10:42,084 --> 00:10:44,712
- and saving thousands of lives...
- Ambassador.

156
00:10:44,796 --> 00:10:49,884
The CIA agrees with Mil Group.
Pablo Escobar is no longer a congressman.

157
00:10:49,968 --> 00:10:53,220
He's just a wanted Colombian
drug trafficker, and as such,

158
00:10:53,304 --> 00:10:58,267
he is not a direct threat to our country's
strategic interests in South America.

159
00:10:58,434 --> 00:11:03,522
The CIA would prefer not to get involved
in local police problems.

160
00:11:03,606 --> 00:11:05,232
Let the Colombians get him.

161
00:11:06,985 --> 00:11:09,403
Noonan really thinks
allocating $100,000

162
00:11:09,487 --> 00:11:12,657
- will be enough to go after Escobar.
- Yeah, it's a fucking joke.

163
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,492
That's about what he spends on shoes,
isn't it?

164
00:11:14,575 --> 00:11:17,662
The CNP has zero chance
of capturing him with that bullshit.

165
00:11:17,745 --> 00:11:19,163
So what do we do now?

166
00:11:19,246 --> 00:11:21,749
Use what little we got
to try to even the odds.

167
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:26,420
It's true,
the hundred grand wasn't that much.

168
00:11:26,504 --> 00:11:29,256
But delivered into the right hands,
it could make a difference.

169
00:11:30,549 --> 00:11:34,094
There were a lot of good cops in Colombia,
honorable men.

170
00:11:34,178 --> 00:11:39,058
But the head of counternarcotics,
General Jaramillo, wasn't one of 'em.

171
00:11:41,226 --> 00:11:44,271
And as such,
he was exactly what we needed.

172
00:11:45,064 --> 00:11:47,025
Thank you for seeing me, General.

173
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:48,734
You're welcome.

174
00:11:48,818 --> 00:11:52,404
Listen, I have General Gomez
assigned to the operation against Pablo.

175
00:11:52,488 --> 00:11:56,868
With all due respect, General Jaramillo...
I propose Horacio Carrillo.

176
00:11:56,951 --> 00:12:00,120
But Carrillo only acts on his own orders.
He doesn't follow anyone.

177
00:12:00,204 --> 00:12:02,040
Well, I don't want him to follow.

178
00:12:02,874 --> 00:12:04,542
I want him to lead.

179
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:11,632
Go ahead.

180
00:12:12,967 --> 00:12:14,844
Yes, General.

181
00:12:14,927 --> 00:12:17,055
As you wish.

182
00:12:17,137 --> 00:12:18,305
Understood.

183
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:23,519
What happened, honey?

184
00:12:23,602 --> 00:12:25,396
Things with work.

185
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:27,690
When will Horacio arrive
to have dinner with us?

186
00:12:27,773 --> 00:12:31,652
I'm making the chicken he likes,
but he's out with the girlfriend.

187
00:12:34,739 --> 00:12:36,741
Tell me what's wrong.

188
00:12:36,949 --> 00:12:39,660
They want me to catch Pablo Escobar.

189
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:46,084
The Ochoas aren't happy at all.

190
00:12:47,418 --> 00:12:50,088
They're saying that since
you've become a wanted man,

191
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,840
bribing the police
has gotten very costly.

192
00:12:52,924 --> 00:12:54,967
They want to renegotiate
the price of our routes.

193
00:12:55,885 --> 00:12:57,053
Hm.

194
00:12:58,054 --> 00:13:01,557
When it came to me killing
to get their sister back, well, then...

195
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,559
I didn't hear them complaining, did I?

196
00:13:03,642 --> 00:13:06,311
Yeah. The problem is that
it is one thing to kill communists

197
00:13:06,395 --> 00:13:09,231
- and another to kill politicians.
- So what now?

198
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,152
What I would do is increase
the payments to the police, you know?

199
00:13:13,235 --> 00:13:14,528
And most of all, to the top brass.

200
00:13:14,737 --> 00:13:17,489
We're already giving too much money
to those bastards.

201
00:13:17,573 --> 00:13:18,657
Mm.

202
00:13:21,702 --> 00:13:24,622
Oh, shit. What's that?
Is it snowing or what?

203
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:27,416
Egrets from the Himalayas.

204
00:13:28,542 --> 00:13:31,003
It took two years
to train them to stay there.

205
00:13:31,837 --> 00:13:34,173
They cost me a million dollars.

206
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,431
Bastards.

207
00:13:43,808 --> 00:13:46,144
Stay in the fucking tree!

208
00:13:56,487 --> 00:13:58,739
Seems like you lost that dough,
eh, cousin?

209
00:14:01,366 --> 00:14:02,910
That's your problem, Pablo.

210
00:14:02,994 --> 00:14:05,496
You think that everything
can be controlled,

211
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:08,082
but it turns out that nature
cannot be controlled.

212
00:14:08,166 --> 00:14:14,005
OK, OK, OK, Gustavo... OK.

213
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,383
Your English is really good.

214
00:14:18,467 --> 00:14:21,595
Thank you. I took a course
at the University of Antioquia.

215
00:14:21,804 --> 00:14:23,305
How long you been at the comuna?

216
00:14:23,514 --> 00:14:25,474
Just a few weeks.

217
00:14:25,557 --> 00:14:28,102
Is your husband
gonna help us here, too?

218
00:14:28,186 --> 00:14:31,522
I saw him when he dropped you off.
What does he do?

219
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:36,360
Oh, he's, uh... head of janitorial
services at the US Embassy.

220
00:14:42,158 --> 00:14:44,576
- I fucked up.
- How?

221
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,204
Carrillo got the job
just like you wanted.

222
00:14:46,411 --> 00:14:48,413
No, Jaramillo's sending a message.

223
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:53,169
He's telling me I got his price wrong.

224
00:14:53,252 --> 00:14:55,796
He's setting Carrillo up for failure,
and when he does fail,

225
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,215
he'll fire him for incompetence,

226
00:14:57,256 --> 00:15:00,092
and me and you,
we lose the only cop we can trust.

227
00:15:02,761 --> 00:15:03,971
- Hey!
- Hey!

228
00:15:04,055 --> 00:15:05,764
- Sorry I'm late, honey.
- Mm...

229
00:15:06,431 --> 00:15:09,309
Javier, this is my friend, Elisa.

230
00:15:09,393 --> 00:15:11,187
- Javier works with Steve.
- Nice to meet you.

231
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,312
Nice to meet you.

232
00:15:13,355 --> 00:15:16,817
Are you another... janitor at the embassy,
like Steve?

233
00:15:16,901 --> 00:15:18,986
No, actually, I'm CIA.

234
00:15:19,195 --> 00:15:22,489
But that's classified,
so don't tell anybody.

235
00:15:22,573 --> 00:15:26,118
I'm here to hunt communists
and prevent a Marxist invasion from Cuba.

236
00:15:26,202 --> 00:15:28,913
- The janitor thing, what, that was you?
- Mm.

237
00:15:28,996 --> 00:15:31,165
No, it's just a cover.

238
00:15:31,249 --> 00:15:33,667
- Thank you for being so honest.
- Mm-hm.

239
00:15:33,751 --> 00:15:36,712
Just so you know,
I'm a communist guerrillera.

240
00:15:38,923 --> 00:15:40,007
Perfect.

241
00:15:40,216 --> 00:15:42,676
If we had known at the time
she was telling the truth...

242
00:15:43,468 --> 00:15:45,304
we probably wouldn't have cared.

243
00:15:45,387 --> 00:15:47,681
We cared about Pablo Escobar.

244
00:15:47,765 --> 00:15:50,851
And catching him...
wasn't gonna be easy.

245
00:15:50,935 --> 00:15:53,979
He had better resources
and better information.

246
00:15:54,188 --> 00:15:56,523
And at the time,
he owned over 800 homes and fincas,

247
00:15:56,732 --> 00:15:59,610
surrounded by dozens of sicarios
willing to die for him.

248
00:15:59,818 --> 00:16:03,281
And cops...
he owned a lot of them, too.

249
00:16:03,488 --> 00:16:04,531
But not all of them.

250
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:09,078
Jaramillo's intel says Pablo's gonna be
at his finca called El Bizcocho tomorrow.

251
00:16:09,161 --> 00:16:11,705
The only way to surprise him
is an aerial assault.

252
00:16:11,789 --> 00:16:14,041
Jaramillo didn't give us a helicopter.

253
00:16:15,251 --> 00:16:17,753
Then we need to figure out
where he's hiding today.

254
00:16:20,672 --> 00:16:22,382
Trapped a little bird.

255
00:16:23,508 --> 00:16:25,094
And I'm gonna make sure that he sings.

256
00:16:26,345 --> 00:16:27,221
Jesus.

257
00:16:32,977 --> 00:16:35,146
Just remember that you wanted all in.

258
00:16:35,354 --> 00:16:37,231
Hand me that coffee.

259
00:16:48,951 --> 00:16:51,495
He already gave up
the name of three fincas,

260
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:53,831
but Pablo's not gonna be at any of them.

261
00:16:54,915 --> 00:16:57,960
But you do know
where he is hiding, don't you?

262
00:17:18,897 --> 00:17:21,066
Look, little brother,

263
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:24,403
I know it scares the shit out of you
that Pablo will kill you.

264
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:28,324
But I will also kill you.

265
00:17:29,158 --> 00:17:30,492
And very slowly.

266
00:17:30,701 --> 00:17:34,705
Pablo is going to kill me more slowly.

267
00:17:34,913 --> 00:17:39,418
Well, then, you should pray we find him,
and quickly.

268
00:17:42,004 --> 00:17:45,299
We knew that Escobar would
get a heads-up the second we moved out,

269
00:17:45,507 --> 00:17:48,927
but there was a small part of me
that thought, in his arrogance,

270
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:51,138
he would stand and fight.

271
00:17:51,222 --> 00:17:53,682
Or maybe we just wanted
to send him a message.

272
00:17:53,765 --> 00:17:55,642
Boss!

273
00:17:55,726 --> 00:17:56,727
Poison...

274
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,103
Boss!

275
00:17:59,355 --> 00:18:02,358
They were headed for El Bizcocho,
but they got off the main highway.

276
00:18:02,441 --> 00:18:05,194
- They're already on their way here.
- How far are they?

277
00:18:05,403 --> 00:18:06,528
Two hours, boss.

278
00:18:06,737 --> 00:18:10,074
Round up the guys,
and tell them to get ready.

279
00:18:10,157 --> 00:18:12,076
- We're leaving.
- All right.

280
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:17,164
We have to go.

281
00:18:18,082 --> 00:18:19,458
Go where?

282
00:18:19,541 --> 00:18:21,252
The police are coming.

283
00:18:21,335 --> 00:18:23,587
- But Pablo, I've been cooking for hours.
- I'm sorry, my love,

284
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:27,549
- but we need to leave now.
- What about our things? Our clothes?

285
00:18:27,632 --> 00:18:29,509
We'll buy new ones later,
won't we?

286
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:34,639
I'm sorry.

287
00:18:35,807 --> 00:18:37,476
Do you hear me complaining?

288
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:45,525
As long as you're with us, Pablo,
I'm prepared to do whatever it takes.

289
00:18:55,202 --> 00:18:57,537
- Bring all of the boxes here.
- Yes, sir.

290
00:18:57,621 --> 00:18:58,956
- Cangrejo!
- Yes?

291
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,209
Go to Pablo's room
and see if anything is in there.

292
00:19:02,293 --> 00:19:03,585
- Efrain!
- Yeah?

293
00:19:03,668 --> 00:19:06,130
The two blue notebooks
are the only ones I'm taking.

294
00:19:09,674 --> 00:19:12,761
Search the whole house to make sure
that not a single loose document remains.

295
00:19:12,844 --> 00:19:14,513
Yes, sir!

296
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:33,407
What's wrong, Gustavo?

297
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:36,868
You fucked us, Pablo.

298
00:19:38,496 --> 00:19:40,498
Not only you and me.

299
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,207
You fucked the whole family.

300
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:49,923
But of course, since you needed
to present yourself to Congress...

301
00:19:51,967 --> 00:19:54,678
since you want to be president
of this motherfucking country,

302
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:57,097
the rest of us get screwed,
isn't that right?

303
00:20:03,145 --> 00:20:04,771
But what the fuck...

304
00:20:06,315 --> 00:20:08,608
a man only dies once, right?

305
00:20:11,653 --> 00:20:12,988
Come here.

306
00:20:19,786 --> 00:20:21,163
My brother.

307
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,791
I'm going to let you sit
next to the pilot. Come on, come on.

308
00:20:27,169 --> 00:20:28,962
There we go.

309
00:20:39,723 --> 00:20:42,100
I like to think
that as Pablo looked down

310
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:44,644
on Hacienda Nápoles for the last time,

311
00:20:44,728 --> 00:20:49,107
he got our message...
and I hope it really pissed him off.

312
00:20:49,191 --> 00:20:53,278
You may have 800 houses, my friend,
but none of them is home.

313
00:20:53,362 --> 00:20:56,448
We will keep you on the run
for the rest of your life,

314
00:20:56,532 --> 00:20:59,493
or until we catch you...
or kill you.

315
00:20:59,577 --> 00:21:02,079
From now on, nowhere is safe.

316
00:21:21,098 --> 00:21:23,517
The only people to detain
were the maids and the gardeners

317
00:21:23,601 --> 00:21:25,936
while we searched the finca
from top to bottom.

318
00:21:27,563 --> 00:21:31,233
The dirt-poor cops
were astounded by the luxury.

319
00:21:31,442 --> 00:21:36,029
Hey, if you're risking your life
for $22 a week... you'd pig out, too.

320
00:21:37,531 --> 00:21:40,033
There's an old saying in law enforcement:

321
00:21:40,117 --> 00:21:42,911
"The bad guys
need to get lucky every time.

322
00:21:42,994 --> 00:21:45,497
The good guys
just need to get lucky once."

323
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:51,670
And in the ashes of Pablo's hasty exit,
I got very lucky.

324
00:21:52,337 --> 00:21:56,467
The address I found led us to a
nondescript building in downtown Medellín.

325
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:59,303
We raided it,
and guess who we found?

326
00:22:00,387 --> 00:22:01,555
Blackbeard.

327
00:22:01,639 --> 00:22:05,016
Pablo's number one accountant
and keeper of all secrets.

328
00:22:05,934 --> 00:22:08,604
In custody,
he would describe a cocaine empire

329
00:22:08,687 --> 00:22:12,524
that was bringing in $60 million a day.

330
00:22:12,608 --> 00:22:15,402
Pablo was bigger than General Motors.

331
00:22:15,486 --> 00:22:19,823
The mountain of evidence filled
an entire room in the Palace of Justice,

332
00:22:19,906 --> 00:22:22,117
home of Colombia's supreme court,

333
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,744
the only place
thought safe enough to store it.

334
00:22:26,288 --> 00:22:30,542
We had enough evidence
to put him away for 100 lifetimes.

335
00:22:30,626 --> 00:22:32,002
Fuck.

336
00:22:34,546 --> 00:22:35,797
Fuck.

337
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,924
- What's up?
- Jaramillo's running the show.

338
00:22:38,008 --> 00:22:40,177
He's pissed we only gave him 100 grand.

339
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:42,596
He's not letting us
make any copies of anything.

340
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,806
Javi, there's some good stuff in here,
stuff we can use.

341
00:22:44,889 --> 00:22:47,058
None of it can leave the room.

342
00:22:47,267 --> 00:22:49,936
The narcos have been
paying some guy named Ellis McPickle

343
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,856
- to run coke all over the place.
- Ellis McPickle?

344
00:22:53,106 --> 00:22:55,609
I'm assuming that it's an alias.

345
00:23:01,657 --> 00:23:02,824
Take 'em.

346
00:23:04,284 --> 00:23:06,995
- What?
- Just stuff 'em down your pants.

347
00:23:07,078 --> 00:23:09,039
What are you talking about?

348
00:23:09,122 --> 00:23:11,583
Do you want to catch Pablo
or not?

349
00:23:14,586 --> 00:23:17,422
- Why me?
- Because they'll suspect me.

350
00:23:17,506 --> 00:23:19,966
- They won't suspect you.
- What if they search me?

351
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,760
They're not gonna
search a white boy, OK?

352
00:23:21,843 --> 00:23:24,095
- You're a guest in their country.
- Guests don't steal.

353
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:25,263
Just do it.

354
00:23:27,224 --> 00:23:29,893
Sometimes you gotta do bad things
to catch bad people.

355
00:23:31,186 --> 00:23:33,021
- And sometimes, bad people...
- Señor.

356
00:23:33,104 --> 00:23:34,356
Help you do good things.

357
00:23:35,357 --> 00:23:37,984
These are
from the narcos' account in Miami.

358
00:23:38,068 --> 00:23:42,113
A cashier's check
payable to "Ellis McPickle."

359
00:23:43,699 --> 00:23:44,658
Yes.

360
00:23:45,701 --> 00:23:49,788
I've heard that name mentioned
in some of the narco wiretap transcripts.

361
00:23:49,871 --> 00:23:51,373
Obviously, it's an alias.

362
00:23:51,456 --> 00:23:55,377
No Colombian would go by the name
"Ellis McPickle."

363
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,713
Because he's not Colombian.

364
00:23:57,921 --> 00:24:03,301
He's an American pilot who transports
tons of cocaine for the cartel.

365
00:24:03,385 --> 00:24:05,136
- A gringo?
- Mm-hm.

366
00:24:06,012 --> 00:24:09,307
- What's his name?
- We don't know.

367
00:24:09,391 --> 00:24:13,937
But we do know that Gustavo
frequently mentions "McPickle."

368
00:24:16,523 --> 00:24:19,067
Suarez, do you ever worry
what will happen to you

369
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:22,446
if Pablo finds out
that you work for both sides?

370
00:24:23,447 --> 00:24:26,157
- I'm on your side.
- Yeah?

371
00:24:26,366 --> 00:24:29,869
Then prove it.
What else can you tell me about McPickle?

372
00:24:31,747 --> 00:24:35,751
We have his photograph
in some of our files.

373
00:24:35,834 --> 00:24:39,713
But maybe you should check with the CIA.
He started his career with them.

374
00:24:46,094 --> 00:24:48,179
Wha... What the fuck is this?

375
00:24:48,263 --> 00:24:49,889
This is me giving you homework.

376
00:24:50,098 --> 00:24:52,350
Former CIA pilot
flying coke for the narcos.

377
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,185
And I need you to find out who it is.

378
00:24:54,394 --> 00:24:57,147
First off, I don't fucking work for you,
Murphy, you hear me?

379
00:24:57,230 --> 00:25:00,108
- So don't come in here thinking that...
- Is that Barry Seal?

380
00:25:02,694 --> 00:25:04,655
What's he up to these days?

381
00:25:04,738 --> 00:25:06,030
Barry Seal.

382
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:16,416
Barry Seal, a good ol'
Southern boy who loved college football,

383
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,169
mind-altering chemicals,
and pussy...

384
00:25:19,377 --> 00:25:21,797
which made him perfect CIA material.

385
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:26,092
But his expensive lifestyle
also made him perfect narco material.

386
00:25:26,968 --> 00:25:28,887
Finding Barry was easy.

387
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:32,056
We just had to stake out
his favorite whorehouse.

388
00:25:32,265 --> 00:25:34,601
It just so happened
to be Peña's favorite, too.

389
00:25:34,685 --> 00:25:37,270
A friend of mine told me about this place.
I've never been here before.

390
00:25:39,564 --> 00:25:40,691
No, I'm serious.

391
00:25:41,692 --> 00:25:43,067
Look.

392
00:25:43,151 --> 00:25:46,363
Oh, my God.
That's Freckles. I know her.

393
00:25:46,571 --> 00:25:47,906
Until next time.

394
00:25:51,284 --> 00:25:54,412
- Goddamn, is that Barry?
- Or should we say McPickle?

395
00:25:55,664 --> 00:25:57,916
Come on, we got you a ride
waiting over here.

396
00:25:57,999 --> 00:25:59,668
Hi, Vanessa.

397
00:26:00,627 --> 00:26:03,380
It's fun to say, though,
ain't it? "McPickle"?

398
00:26:08,134 --> 00:26:09,803
Have a seat, Barry.

399
00:26:14,432 --> 00:26:18,520
You seem awful relaxed for someone
who's facing life in the clink.

400
00:26:18,603 --> 00:26:21,314
Well, you guys ain't got shit.

401
00:26:21,398 --> 00:26:26,152
We got records from Escobar listing
shipments from Medellín to Louisiana

402
00:26:26,236 --> 00:26:28,238
- to the tune of 500 tons?
- Yeah.

403
00:26:28,321 --> 00:26:33,034
Yeah? Well, let's see
if that holds up in court, huh?

404
00:26:33,243 --> 00:26:36,830
The funny thing is you can't make
a direct flight from Medellín to Louisiana

405
00:26:36,914 --> 00:26:38,623
without making a refueling stop.

406
00:26:38,832 --> 00:26:42,043
Yeah, according to the records,
you made stops in Cuba and Nicaragua.

407
00:26:43,378 --> 00:26:44,671
The manifests don't lie.

408
00:26:44,755 --> 00:26:48,884
An ex-CIA man making stops in communist
countries with or without cocaine,

409
00:26:48,967 --> 00:26:52,637
that would be considered treason
by the US Justice Department, wouldn't it?

410
00:26:52,721 --> 00:26:56,600
Well, damn... you guys are good.

411
00:26:56,683 --> 00:26:58,017
Communist sympathizer.

412
00:26:58,101 --> 00:27:00,103
We're gonna wrap you up
in a big, red bow

413
00:27:00,311 --> 00:27:01,980
and drop you right off
at Reagan's doorstep.

414
00:27:02,063 --> 00:27:04,566
Using Cuba and Nicaragua
as refueling stops for coke shipments,

415
00:27:04,649 --> 00:27:07,193
that's treason and trafficking.

416
00:27:07,402 --> 00:27:09,654
What's that,
two life sentences for the price of one?

417
00:27:10,739 --> 00:27:11,865
That's right.

418
00:27:14,952 --> 00:27:18,997
Well... see,
I figured this day might come.

419
00:27:19,205 --> 00:27:22,125
Why don't you uncuff me, boys.
I got something to show you.

420
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:23,334
Yeah? What's that?

421
00:27:23,418 --> 00:27:26,129
It's what I call
a "get out of jail free" card.

422
00:27:26,212 --> 00:27:29,591
Y'all gonna wanna see this.
Come on, uncuff me.

423
00:27:29,674 --> 00:27:32,176
What Barry had was a picture of Escobar

424
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:36,222
loading cocaine on a tarmac
in Nicaragua. Why does that matter?

425
00:27:36,306 --> 00:27:40,351
'Cause at the time, Nicaragua was
governed by the communist Sandinistas,

426
00:27:40,435 --> 00:27:43,229
who were letting Escobar
use their country as a landing strip

427
00:27:43,313 --> 00:27:46,024
for cocaine shipments to the US.

428
00:27:46,107 --> 00:27:50,153
Colombian cocaine coming through
a communist country and into America?

429
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:51,571
I couldn't have made that up.

430
00:27:51,655 --> 00:27:53,531
- Holy shit.
- It was too good.

431
00:27:53,615 --> 00:27:56,409
- Gotta turn this over to the ambassador.
- Wait, wait, wait. No.

432
00:27:56,493 --> 00:27:59,245
This leaks wide and Barry Seal
is a dead man. We gotta be careful.

433
00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:02,791
Why are you trying to protect some scumbag
who's trafficked over 500 tons?

434
00:28:02,874 --> 00:28:05,043
I have a code of ethics
when it comes to informants.

435
00:28:05,126 --> 00:28:08,588
But not when it comes
to torturing suspects with hot coffee.

436
00:28:08,672 --> 00:28:10,924
- You know, I wouldn't judge Carrillo.
- Why is that?

437
00:28:11,008 --> 00:28:14,511
You had a partner killed.
He's had a dozen.

438
00:28:23,895 --> 00:28:27,148
I always admired
Peña's commitment to informants,

439
00:28:27,231 --> 00:28:30,318
but frankly,
Barry Seal wasn't an informant.

440
00:28:30,401 --> 00:28:32,278
He was just another busted trafficker

441
00:28:32,362 --> 00:28:35,949
who ratted on the guys
he worked with... a snitch.

442
00:28:37,408 --> 00:28:39,661
If I could use
the narco-communist connection

443
00:28:39,744 --> 00:28:42,914
to get the resources we needed,
then fuck him.

444
00:28:43,122 --> 00:28:45,333
Strange bedfellows, indeed.

445
00:28:45,416 --> 00:28:49,170
You have single-handedly
exposed a narco-communist connection.

446
00:28:49,379 --> 00:28:51,339
Washington is gonna go crazy.

447
00:28:52,173 --> 00:28:53,842
Thank you, Ambassador.

448
00:28:55,301 --> 00:28:58,262
This has to be highly classified
for the safety of the informant.

449
00:28:58,346 --> 00:28:59,472
Of course.

450
00:29:01,808 --> 00:29:02,767
Thank you.

451
00:29:05,186 --> 00:29:09,774
In Washington, "highly classified"
didn't carry much water.

452
00:29:09,983 --> 00:29:13,862
Especially when a Marine colonel named
Oliver North got his hands on the picture.

453
00:29:14,071 --> 00:29:16,865
I know every American parent
concerned about the drug problem

454
00:29:16,948 --> 00:29:21,369
will be outraged to learn that
top Nicaraguan government officials

455
00:29:21,452 --> 00:29:24,622
are deeply involved in drug trafficking.

456
00:29:24,706 --> 00:29:27,959
This picture shows Federico Vaughan,

457
00:29:28,043 --> 00:29:31,880
a top aide to one of the nine comandantes
who rule Nicaragua,

458
00:29:31,963 --> 00:29:36,927
loading an aircraft with illegal narcotics
bound for the United States.

459
00:29:38,011 --> 00:29:42,223
No, there seems to be no crime
to which the Sandinistas will not stoop.

460
00:29:42,432 --> 00:29:45,560
Being a rat is a dangerous business,

461
00:29:45,643 --> 00:29:47,771
and Escobar's reach was long.

462
00:29:47,854 --> 00:29:50,481
Barry Seal refused federal protection...

463
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:55,695
and met his end
in a parking lot in Baton Rouge.

464
00:29:55,904 --> 00:29:57,196
Whoops.

465
00:30:04,162 --> 00:30:06,706
Motherfucker!
I told you we had to be careful.

466
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:09,918
- You got Barry Seal killed.
- Peña, if he wanted a long life,

467
00:30:10,001 --> 00:30:12,754
- he should've worked at Kodak.
- You're responsible for his death.

468
00:30:12,963 --> 00:30:15,590
I didn't kill him, Escobar did.

469
00:30:16,507 --> 00:30:18,885
Now we can go after that motherfucker.

470
00:30:18,969 --> 00:30:21,138
Look on the bright side, man.

471
00:30:23,014 --> 00:30:25,100
From then on, according to Reagan,

472
00:30:25,183 --> 00:30:28,645
fighting the narcos
was the same as fighting the commies.

473
00:30:28,728 --> 00:30:32,356
We got a tidal wave of money
and all the resources we needed.

474
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:35,401
The US Southern Command in Panama
sent us a care package:

475
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:39,906
planes, helicopters,
you fucking name it. Everything.

476
00:30:44,786 --> 00:30:49,124
Our resources and intel helped the
Colombians raid labs all over the country

477
00:30:49,207 --> 00:30:53,753
and burn 'em straight to the ground,
seizing over a billion dollars in coke.

478
00:30:53,962 --> 00:30:56,881
We were kicking ass,
and the narcos were feeling it.

479
00:30:57,632 --> 00:31:00,426
The price of cocaine in Miami
was skyrocketing.

480
00:31:00,635 --> 00:31:04,806
Despite all this, we'd yet
to net one of the Medellín kingpins...

481
00:31:04,889 --> 00:31:08,601
till we put a tracking device
on a Colombian-bound shipment of ether,

482
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:10,436
the essential ingredient
in cocaine processing.

483
00:31:10,645 --> 00:31:11,562
Got it!

484
00:31:13,064 --> 00:31:15,817
The barrel that we tracked
brought us to Tranquilandia,

485
00:31:16,026 --> 00:31:19,362
Medellín's biggest processing lab,
and we hit it hard.

486
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:22,782
The ensuing gun battle
cost dozens of men...

487
00:31:22,866 --> 00:31:25,618
but in the end,
it got us our biggest victory to date,

488
00:31:25,702 --> 00:31:29,998
Carlos Lehder.

489
00:31:30,207 --> 00:31:33,168
In my tent is a bag with $50,000...

490
00:31:33,251 --> 00:31:35,253
ten times this if you give me one hour.

491
00:31:35,461 --> 00:31:39,757
There's no way out,
Carlitos. You're going to Disneyland.

492
00:31:43,136 --> 00:31:45,889
Lehder was immediately
extradited to the States,

493
00:31:45,972 --> 00:31:51,435
where a federal court
sentenced him to life... plus 135 years.

494
00:31:52,229 --> 00:31:56,649
Extradition worked.
Carlos will die in an American jail.

495
00:31:58,151 --> 00:32:01,779
And no one savored this victory
more than the Colombians.

496
00:32:01,863 --> 00:32:05,200
For anti-narco candidate
Luis Carlos Galán,

497
00:32:05,283 --> 00:32:09,537
it would provide him the momentum
he needed to propel him to the presidency.

498
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,956
Extradition would become his battle cry.

499
00:32:12,165 --> 00:32:13,958
Gentlemen?

500
00:32:15,668 --> 00:32:17,003
Thank you.

501
00:32:18,255 --> 00:32:22,092
And for the narcos,
this was a declaration of war.

502
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:26,304
What happened to Carlos was terrible.

503
00:32:27,513 --> 00:32:30,600
But I have already presented a motion
before the Supreme Court of Colombia

504
00:32:30,683 --> 00:32:34,353
against the legality of extradition.

505
00:32:34,437 --> 00:32:39,358
They are examining it this week
at the Palace of Justice.

506
00:32:39,442 --> 00:32:42,028
Can we buy someone in that court?

507
00:32:43,113 --> 00:32:45,198
Unfortunately, no.

508
00:32:45,282 --> 00:32:48,743
It's the only institution in this country
that is incorruptible.

509
00:32:49,827 --> 00:32:52,830
Let's pray that the ruling
comes out in our favor.

510
00:32:52,914 --> 00:32:55,708
Brother... even after he's dead,

511
00:32:55,917 --> 00:32:59,170
Carlos still has a sentence
of 135 years in prison.

512
00:32:59,254 --> 00:33:01,172
He's totally fucked.

513
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,882
This is gringo bullshit.

514
00:33:02,966 --> 00:33:06,761
That happened to him for speaking
about the revolution on the radio.

515
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:09,097
We're next, aren't we?

516
00:33:09,306 --> 00:33:11,182
You're right.

517
00:33:11,266 --> 00:33:13,184
Pablito?

518
00:33:13,268 --> 00:33:14,769
Do you have an answer or what?

519
00:33:18,856 --> 00:33:24,403
Well... in my opinion, a jail
in the United States is worse than death.

520
00:33:25,155 --> 00:33:28,658
We can never forget
what happened to Carlos.

521
00:33:28,741 --> 00:33:31,328
Carlos was one of us.

522
00:33:33,037 --> 00:33:38,209
Fabio is right.
The Americans are fucking us.

523
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:40,544
But remember,
there's something they want more than us.

524
00:33:40,628 --> 00:33:43,756
So, brothers...

525
00:33:45,049 --> 00:33:46,843
it's time to give them what they want,
isn't it?

526
00:33:48,178 --> 00:33:51,722
I didn't think our paths
would cross again.

527
00:33:51,806 --> 00:33:55,101
What you want isn't going to be easy.
It's very risky.

528
00:33:55,185 --> 00:33:59,563
It's going to require weapons and men.
There will be casualties.

529
00:33:59,647 --> 00:34:04,944
I understand what you want.
How much are we talking about?

530
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,739
Two million US dollars.

531
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,450
It's very dangerous.

532
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:16,414
Fighting a revolution
comes with sacrifice...

533
00:34:17,415 --> 00:34:21,336
and it goes without saying
that it will dangerous, right?

534
00:34:32,222 --> 00:34:34,098
But for us, brother...

535
00:34:34,849 --> 00:34:38,686
it is our duty to fight to the very end.

536
00:34:40,021 --> 00:34:43,400
We have an historical obligation.

537
00:34:44,901 --> 00:34:47,362
We can't forget that.

538
00:34:47,445 --> 00:34:49,072
I'm his girlfriend.

539
00:34:56,662 --> 00:34:58,248
Meet Pablo Escobar.

540
00:35:01,042 --> 00:35:02,335
Miss.

541
00:35:03,378 --> 00:35:05,088
- OK.
- We have a deal.

542
00:35:05,171 --> 00:35:06,589
All right, then.

543
00:35:07,424 --> 00:35:09,842
We were just leaving.

544
00:35:09,926 --> 00:35:11,261
Good night.

545
00:35:18,601 --> 00:35:20,895
What the hell is this?

546
00:35:20,978 --> 00:35:23,106
Why are you meeting with Escobar?

547
00:35:23,189 --> 00:35:26,901
We made a deal...
obviously for money.

548
00:35:27,985 --> 00:35:29,695
In exchange for what?

549
00:35:29,904 --> 00:35:34,325
Unless you are willing to be part of it,
I cannot say.

550
00:35:36,911 --> 00:35:41,416
It's a partnership,
necessary for the revolutionary fight.

551
00:35:41,499 --> 00:35:45,878
I fight for the people...
not for drug traffickers.

552
00:36:01,436 --> 00:36:02,812
Connie?

553
00:36:02,895 --> 00:36:04,730
Elisa? What's going on?

554
00:36:05,648 --> 00:36:07,066
- I need to talk to you.
- About what?

555
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:09,152
You told me your husband
works at the embassy.

556
00:36:09,235 --> 00:36:10,445
Yeah.

557
00:36:10,653 --> 00:36:12,280
I need you to speak with him
and warn him.

558
00:36:12,363 --> 00:36:13,572
About what?

559
00:36:13,781 --> 00:36:17,743
Pablo Escobar is planning something
with a communist group called the M-19.

560
00:36:17,952 --> 00:36:19,870
I don't know what it is,
but I know it's gonna be bad.

561
00:36:19,954 --> 00:36:22,957
Wait, Pablo Escobar?
How do you know anything about Escobar?

562
00:36:23,166 --> 00:36:26,585
I... I just know.
You need to warn him...

563
00:36:26,669 --> 00:36:28,129
and you need to hide me.

564
00:36:29,464 --> 00:36:31,048
OK. Come on.

565
00:36:34,593 --> 00:36:37,555
Steve's already at work,
but Javi lives downstairs.

566
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,898
I just hope he's here.

567
00:36:47,982 --> 00:36:49,400
I am.

568
00:36:50,693 --> 00:36:52,945
- Well, what have we here?
- I'll explain later.

569
00:36:53,029 --> 00:36:54,531
I'll be right back. Go.

570
00:36:59,369 --> 00:37:01,204
- She told me that Escobar...
- Slow down.

571
00:37:01,287 --> 00:37:04,248
Hired guerrillas called M-19. Thinks
they're gonna do something terrible.

572
00:37:04,332 --> 00:37:06,667
- Slow down.
- Escobar is using members of M-19.

573
00:37:06,750 --> 00:37:09,170
- Say that again?
- Pablo Escobar and M-19 guerrillas.

574
00:37:09,253 --> 00:37:10,421
Escobar and M-19?

575
00:37:10,505 --> 00:37:12,798
She didn't tell me any details,
just that it would be bad.

576
00:37:12,882 --> 00:37:14,800
No... that doesn't make any sense.

577
00:37:14,884 --> 00:37:17,678
She asked me to hide her,
so I took her to Javi's apartment.

578
00:37:17,761 --> 00:37:18,804
OK. All right.

579
00:37:32,193 --> 00:37:33,194
- Agent Murphy!
- All right.

580
00:37:33,403 --> 00:37:36,531
Ambassador, I got information
with Escobar and M-19. I think they're...

581
00:37:36,739 --> 00:37:39,242
- supreme court building.
- Oh, my God.

582
00:37:40,493 --> 00:37:42,245
"Oh, my God" is right.

583
00:37:42,328 --> 00:37:46,790
Financed by Escobar, the M-19 guerrillas
stormed the Palace of Justice

584
00:37:46,999 --> 00:37:49,377
and occupied the supreme court.

585
00:37:49,586 --> 00:37:52,671
They took over 100 hostages
and made a bunch of demands

586
00:37:52,755 --> 00:37:56,426
about the redistribution of wealth
and an end to injustice and tyranny...

587
00:37:56,634 --> 00:37:58,177
but it was all bullshit.

588
00:37:59,178 --> 00:38:00,513
The military attacked.

589
00:38:00,721 --> 00:38:02,473
Dozens of lives
were lost in the carnage,

590
00:38:02,681 --> 00:38:06,018
including half of
Colombia's supreme court justices.

591
00:38:07,186 --> 00:38:08,646
Most of the M-19 were killed.

592
00:38:08,854 --> 00:38:12,900
Some escaped... but not before
accomplishing their true goal:

593
00:38:14,818 --> 00:38:20,283
setting fire to the room that contained
600,000 pages of evidence against Escobar.

594
00:38:21,492 --> 00:38:24,036
The entire case against him
turned to ash.

595
00:38:28,165 --> 00:38:31,628
In the United States,
the Mafia makes witnesses disappear

596
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,712
so they can't testify in court.

597
00:38:35,131 --> 00:38:39,176
In Colombia, Pablo Escobar
made the whole court disappear.

598
00:38:41,762 --> 00:38:45,516
The fires set by guerrillas
earlier in the day grew even stronger

599
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,144
as cannon shells exploded inside.

600
00:38:55,067 --> 00:38:57,487
- Where is she?
- Well, come on in.

601
00:38:57,695 --> 00:39:00,906
You, up! Who in the fuck is she
and why is the military after her?

602
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,283
Put the gun away.

603
00:39:03,242 --> 00:39:04,452
Put it away.

604
00:39:05,662 --> 00:39:07,664
She told me who she is.
Put the gun away.

605
00:39:07,746 --> 00:39:09,915
- Can I say something?
- No, you may not.

606
00:39:09,999 --> 00:39:13,544
Murphy... calm down.

607
00:39:14,795 --> 00:39:17,256
I have no idea
why you'd get yourself involved in this.

608
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,509
Your wife brought her to me.

609
00:39:21,218 --> 00:39:23,929
I appreciate you putting yourself
out there for my wife, I truly do,

610
00:39:24,013 --> 00:39:26,056
but why are we risking
our whole careers over this woman?

611
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:29,059
Because she can prove
that Pablo was behind the palace siege.

612
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:35,316
If she can tie Escobar to the siege,
I say we bring her in.

613
00:39:35,399 --> 00:39:36,984
Well, she's M-19.

614
00:39:37,067 --> 00:39:39,445
Noonan would have to turn her over
to the Colombian military

615
00:39:39,529 --> 00:39:40,779
and then she gets disappeared.

616
00:39:40,863 --> 00:39:43,115
I'd like to avoid
another Barry Seal situation.

617
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:45,326
So we're gonna
harbor a communist fugitive?

618
00:39:45,409 --> 00:39:47,745
Look, all she did was warn us.

619
00:39:47,828 --> 00:39:50,289
She's not on anybody's radar.

620
00:39:50,373 --> 00:39:52,458
She's not involved in anything.

621
00:39:56,170 --> 00:40:00,466
The red X's you see in these pictures
indicate M-19 revolutionaries

622
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:02,968
terminated by
the Colombian Special Forces.

623
00:40:03,177 --> 00:40:07,097
The remaining individuals you see
are fugitives.

624
00:40:07,181 --> 00:40:09,808
Folks, this is more complicated
than what it seems.

625
00:40:09,892 --> 00:40:13,396
This was Escobar, classic.
He's cut a deal with M-19.

626
00:40:14,689 --> 00:40:17,233
Next you'll tell us
Escobar sank the Titanic.

627
00:40:17,441 --> 00:40:20,444
Was it coincidence the extradition
evidence against him was destroyed?

628
00:40:20,653 --> 00:40:22,863
He doesn't hold grudges,
not if it suits his purposes.

629
00:40:22,946 --> 00:40:26,867
- How do you know he cut a deal?
- We have a confidential informant.

630
00:40:27,076 --> 00:40:29,495
You willing to identify this informant,
Agent Peña?

631
00:40:29,579 --> 00:40:33,290
- No, I am not.
- Needless to say...

632
00:40:33,374 --> 00:40:36,960
Southern Command has rescinded
its offer of resources to the DEA

633
00:40:37,044 --> 00:40:39,171
in light of this communist aggression.

634
00:40:39,255 --> 00:40:41,131
We need to target the M-19 leadership:

635
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:44,176
Ivan "the Terrible" Torres
and Elisa Alvarez.

636
00:41:04,113 --> 00:41:07,491
They're looking for us everywhere.

637
00:41:07,575 --> 00:41:09,535
What did you expect?

638
00:41:09,619 --> 00:41:11,579
That it would be any different?

639
00:41:15,082 --> 00:41:18,127
You did a very good job.

640
00:41:31,808 --> 00:41:35,394
You can't imagine how much
this is going to help our cause.

641
00:41:35,603 --> 00:41:38,648
No, brother.
The truth is, you helped mine.

642
00:41:41,818 --> 00:41:43,360
You, Ivan...

643
00:41:44,445 --> 00:41:47,698
gave me the sword of Simón Bolívar.

644
00:41:49,492 --> 00:41:52,244
The same one that freed this country.

645
00:41:58,083 --> 00:41:59,836
Now it belongs to you.

646
00:42:04,381 --> 00:42:09,762
With it, you will continue the fight...
to free this country.

647
00:42:12,973 --> 00:42:15,934
I promise you,
I will continue the fight.

648
00:42:16,143 --> 00:42:18,103
You earned it, brother.

649
00:42:19,605 --> 00:42:21,398
As for me...

650
00:42:22,733 --> 00:42:24,735
I'll be in Panama until this blows over.

651
00:42:25,778 --> 00:42:27,279
We are also...

652
00:42:31,659 --> 00:42:33,786
Make sure you grab the briefcase.

653
00:42:35,538 --> 00:42:37,164
And the fucking sword.
