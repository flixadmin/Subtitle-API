1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,611
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,091
<i>After five years in hell,</i>

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:09,041
<i>I returned home with only one goal,
to save my city.</i>

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,605
<i>But my old approach wasn't enough.</i>

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,604
<i>I had to become someone else.</i>

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:15,445
<i>I had to become something else.</i>

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,445
<i>I had to become the Green Arrow.</i>

8
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:19,921
Previously on Arrow...

9
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,451
Someone else is
throwing their hat in the ring.

10
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,364
- Who?
- Ruvé Adams.

11
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,281
I'm Oliver.

12
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,761
<i>He can't know that you're
his father. And nobody else can.</i>

13
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,122
I know who Oliver Queen cares about
more than anyone.

14
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,361
Who?

15
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:33,961
His son. William.

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,966
<i>Merritt Davis will be
moderating the debate.</i>

17
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,806
There <i>'II be</i> a <i>podium there,
another one there.</i>

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,644
And according to tradition,

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,804
the selection's made
by some coin-toss thingy.

20
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,485
Mr. Queen.

21
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,407
At last, we meet.

22
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,481
Ms. Adams.

23
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,802
I'm just curious,
is Adams your maiden name?

24
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,644
Oh, I'm not married, actually.

25
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,801
- Really?
- Mmm.

26
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:59,804
Well, I'm sure you just haven't
met the right person yet.

27
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,284
Well, it is lovely to finally meet you.

28
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,167
An unconventional candidate,
to say the least.

29
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,446
Bit of a dark horse yourself.

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,971
Just meaning that your candidacy
seems to have come out of nowhere.

31
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,847
Well, generally, I prefer to keep
my philanthropic works quiet,

32
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,004
but the city is in simply too much trouble
for me to remain in the shadows.

33
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,241
Yes, it is.

34
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:22,683
The people destroying our homes
need to be fought in the light of day.

35
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,521
Well, I hope that we have
a productive debate, Mr. Queen.

36
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,761
I look forward to it.

37
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,610
Ms. Adams.

38
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,689
More like Mrs. Deceitful Darhk.

39
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,206
I feel like "Adams" probably polls better.

40
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,441
You know, it's not like we can prove

41
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,846
that Adams isn't her real last name.

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,604
How is our opposition research coming?

43
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,848
Nothing yet.
She's apparently clean.

44
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,044
But the more we do digging
into her and her background,

45
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,681
<i>the more likely
she is gonna dig into ours.</i>

46
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:49,961
I think that's our cue.

47
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,044
Hey, wait, I really need you to take a
look at these engagement-party invites.

48
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,685
My mom's been hounding me.

49
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,126
The envelope is very pink.

50
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,689
I know. Wait, don't...

51
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,081
Open it.

52
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,611
You should've totally
seen that one coming.

53
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,801
I'm so sorry.

54
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,843
- What do you think?
- Maybe less glitter.

55
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,041
You look good in glitter.

56
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,611
Yeah, let's move out.

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,445
The valet's bringing up her car.

58
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,766
All right, Laurel's got the eyeball.

59
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,485
You should move.

60
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,000
Are you gonna be all right in here?

61
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,083
Oh, yeah. Great Wi-Fi.

62
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,606
Overwatch on.

63
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,286
I've got her approaching 7th.

64
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,925
<i>You think she's headed to her house again?</i>

65
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,168
Like she did the last six times
we trailed her, you mean?

66
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,805
She has to be coordinating
with Darhk somehow.

67
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,321
We keep this up, we learn how,
we find out where he is.

68
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,045
I've run out of roof.

69
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,685
I'm On it.

70
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,565
<i>If she turns left on Wilson,
she'll be headed home.</i>

71
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,047
She's not. Right turn.
Could be our lucky night.

72
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,321
Speedy, you're it.

73
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,166
Got her.

74
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,648
<i>Green Arrow,
are you ready for the handoff?</i>

75
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,330
Already there.

76
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,727
<i>I've got eyes on.</i>

77
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,165
- <i>I lost</i> her.
- What do you mean?

78
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,566
That pursuit was textbook.

79
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,204
You had an appointment
with my husband the other week.

80
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,046
He does not take kindly to being stood up.

81
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,086
And he has a little something to say
about you stalking his wife as well.

82
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,041
FELICITYI Are you all right?

83
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,049
She got away again.

84
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,844
Okay. So clearly, we're not gonna
find Darhk by tailing his wife.

85
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,765
Yeah, well, it's not like we have
a lot of moves left to make.

86
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,083
Darhk has gone, well, dark,
ever since Machin attacked his family.

87
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,203
Darhk is not afraid of Machin.

88
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,006
He's just...
His plan's gone to a new phase.

89
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,440
But how do you know that?

90
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,881
Because HIVE spent months
trying to cripple this city's leadership.

91
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,525
They discouraged people
from running for mayor.

92
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,330
They even tried to co-opt my candidacy.

93
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,602
Yeah, then Mrs. Evil
threw her hat in the ring.

94
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,801
There has to be a reason.

95
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,483
Darhk did not try and destroy Star City
so that his wife could be mayor.

96
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,363
There's something that we're not seeing.

97
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,561
<i>Oh, I can see it.</i>

98
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,570
Clear as day.
You on the podium, Thursday night,

99
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,287
vexing Oliver Queen
with your political legerdemain.

100
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,609
Until we take him out
of the game completely, you mean.

101
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,411
Oh, you're not reconsidering the plan?

102
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,605
Malcolm Merlyn reached out,
gave me an early birthday present.

103
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,723
It would be a shame not to make use of it.

104
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,611
Ah! My buddies.

105
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,443
Let's get the rest of
the organization on the line.

106
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,365
Ladies and gentlemen,

107
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,606
I am giddy to report that
Phase 4 is proceeding on schedule.

108
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,407
There's still some concern
about the Star City operation.

109
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,806
Enlighten me.

110
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,765
Phase 5 requires control over City Hall.

111
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,645
Yet, somehow, we've found ourselves

112
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,923
mired in a petty political race
to see that happen.

113
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,447
We didn't exactly plan
on Oliver Queen, did we?

114
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,721
No one ever does.

115
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,682
<i>I think what Mr. Armitage
is too polite to say</i>

116
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,684
<i>is that Phase 5 now rests</i>

117
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,801
<i>on your wife's questionable
political acumen.</i>

118
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,684
Tomas, how is Madrid this time of year?

119
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,090
I remember taking a siesta
in your office, once.

120
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,601
I can practically picture
the room right now.

121
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,531
As if I'm actually in it.

122
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,965
Okay, then. Anything else to cover?

123
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,407
Well, there is the matter
of Quentin Lance.

124
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,080
He's clearly been aiding the vigilantes.

125
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,361
I can confirm as much.

126
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,846
Don't worry.

127
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,209
That loose end is about to be well tied.

128
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,806
Hi.

129
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,651
Hey, time for my 8:00 feed already?

130
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,121
Funny. I thought you could use
a little pick-me-up.

131
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,608
I think you used that excuse last week
to check up on me.

132
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,451
DA's office never worked
with my department so much.

133
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,330
I'm just... I'm worried about you.

134
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,561
No kidding.

135
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,000
No, Dad, seriously.

136
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,690
Darhk has to know that you're the one that

137
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,325
gave up the Ghost base of operations.

138
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,285
And I go to work every day
surrounded by men and women with guns.

139
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,687
It is all right, sweetheart.
It's all right.

140
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,689
Hello. Lance. Yeah.

141
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,926
Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right.
I'll be there in 10.

142
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,322
I've got a possible 602.

143
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,760
Isn't that a little below your pay grade?

144
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,843
Uh, yeah, that's how shorthanded we are.

145
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,206
Good, I'll come with you.

146
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,049
I'll wait in the car,
and then we can go for dinner.

147
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,164
I got plans with Donna.

148
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,046
That's even better.

149
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,325
I've been wanting to spend some time with
the woman that won over my father's heart.

150
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,971
Oh, wow.

151
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,524
Oh, I knew we should've had Slade Wilson
do the party planning.

152
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,404
Hey, guys. lam...

153
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,728
You know, I don't know how I'm gonna
get everything done in time.

154
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,285
- Maybe we should cancel.
- What?

155
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,404
I think what Felicity is trying to say
is that we just don't...

156
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,045
We don't want you working too hard.

157
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,850
I don't consider this work.

158
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,963
I think of it as a dry run
for your wedding.

159
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,201
- Mmm-hmm.
- So listen,

160
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,648
we are gonna have
party favors over in that corner,

161
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,004
we're gonna have a champagne tower
right here, mmm-hmm,

162
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,285
and we're gonna play games
over by the fireplace.

163
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,563
Oh, oh, oh, I brought my favorite,
Pin The Junk On The Hunk.

164
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,961
<i>FELICITYI Oh, my God.</i>

165
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,086
Sorry. Is this bad timing?

166
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,441
For who?

167
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,848
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah. We got to, uh...

168
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,407
- Yeah.
- Uh, where are you going?

169
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,802
Duty calls. Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

170
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,242
Is everything okay?

171
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,007
So, Alex got a phone call from one of the
lawyers doing research on the opposition,

172
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,850
and it looks like
they might've found something.

173
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,041
On Ruvé?

174
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,971
On you, actually.

175
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:41,084
In 2013, Homeland Security
did a tax audit after the Undertaking,

176
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,444
and looks like Mom wrote
a million-dollar check

177
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,883
to some woman named Samantha Clayton.

178
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,811
I mean, Alex flagged it as something
potentially weird for us.

179
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,729
By weird, he means...

180
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,809
Well, the check was never cashed.

181
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,287
So, why would Mom write a check
for a million dollars

182
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,891
to a woman young enough
to be her daughter,

183
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,447
and why would that woman
not cash the check?

184
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,966
I don't know.

185
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,322
Should I look into this Samantha person?

186
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,641
I don't really see the point.

187
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,810
I mean, whatever was going on
with this Samantha person,

188
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,685
clearly, she wanted
nothing to do with Morn.

189
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,723
And either way, I don't... It's just...

190
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,491
I don't see how something like this
would blow back on me.

191
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,321
Thank you.

192
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:22,806
Okay.

193
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,210
Everything has unfolded
according to providence.

194
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,324
What do you think is under there, anyway?

195
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,045
Power, Mr. Queen.

196
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,641
I'm glad you have recuperated.

197
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,405
We have much to accomplish together.

198
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,887
Reiter's pet.

199
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,450
You don't know what you're talking about.

200
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,880
I know you killed Vlad.

201
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,602
I watched. We all did.

202
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,122
What are you going to do?
Kill him right in front of Reiter's men?

203
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,329
They don't care what we do to him.

204
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,249
They remember what he did to Conklin.

205
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,607
Maybe you men need to go
for a drink or something.

206
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,569
A 602 is breaking and entering.

207
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,730
Why would they need backup
in the form of a police captain?

208
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,843
I told you, we're shorthanded.

209
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,966
Don't worry.

210
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,208
It's not a job for Black Canary.

211
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,521
SCPD! Anyone here?

212
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,881
Yeah, this is Lance. Get me dispatch.

213
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,803
- (Dad!
- {GROANS)

214
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,291
Come on.

215
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,925
Thought I told you to stay in the car.

216
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,042
Yeah, you're welcome.

217
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,763
Go, go, go!

218
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,845
Laurel! Laurel! Go! Go, get out!

219
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,483
Get out! Come on!

220
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,251
Go, go, go!

221
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,044
Are you okay?

222
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,330
What the hell was that?

223
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,649
I don't know. It's like the building
attacked me or something.

224
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,081
But that's not possible.

225
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,327
Is it?

226
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,686
Captain, you move again
and it's gonna leave an even bigger scar.

227
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,126
What happened?

228
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,606
Your guess is as good as mine.

229
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,002
It's like the Big Bad Wolf
huffed or puffed or something.

230
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,201
This wolf being Darhk.

231
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,850
Why do you think they
went through so much trouble

232
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,166
to make it look like an accident?

233
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,170
Maybe they didn't want to take the heat
of killing a police captain.

234
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,885
Thanks for the needlepoint.

235
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,127
Where are you going?

236
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,562
Yeah, if Damien Darhk
has you in his gun sights,

237
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,888
it might not be a good idea
to show yourself in the open.

238
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,366
Uh, I'm meeting with Donna.

239
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,085
Oh, she's fine.
She's probably just playing

240
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,049
Pin The Junk On The Hunk or something.

241
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,964
- What?
- Do not ask. Do not ask.

242
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,964
Stay here for a minute
and let us do what we do.

243
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,361
Look, I'm gonna check with Andy.

244
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,642
See if he's ever seen HIVE
use these tactics before.

245
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,841
<i>Besides, I'm on Daddy duty.</i>

246
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,405
Now that Lyla's the head of A.R.G.U.S.

247
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,365
I'm gonna try and backtrace the call
that supposedly came from dispatch.

248
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,766
I am...

249
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,207
Going to go work on your debate prep?

250
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,881
Yeah.

251
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,486
Debate prep, just took the words
right out of my mouth.

252
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,767
Yep.

253
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,167
This man deserves to die. He tortured us!

254
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,362
And he saved me.

255
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,570
At great risk to himself,
he kept me alive.

256
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,841
I have more reason than anyone
to hate this man.

257
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,011
But he's our best chance of going home.

258
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,241
He killed your brother.

259
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,568
Yes, he did.

260
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,367
Tell them why.

261
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,886
The guard, Conklin, he put Vlad up to it.

262
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,363
I was defending myself. He attacked me.

263
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,205
Now, I...

264
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,206
I know that you have no reason
to trust me,

265
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,402
but I am not your enemy.

266
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,686
All I want to do is stop Reiter,

267
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,281
and get all of you out of this place.

268
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,881
So prove it.

269
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,081
How?

270
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,005
Kill Conklin.

271
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,170
Aside from my brother,
have you killed before?

272
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,727
Yeah.

273
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,247
There was a man in Hong Kong.

274
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,690
And I did terrible things to him.

275
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,084
And that made me a monster.

276
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,080
And you're afraid killing Conklin
will make you into this monster again?

277
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,451
Good.

278
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,522
It takes a monster to fight monsters.

279
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,327
I like this midday summons.

280
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,003
It's very mysterious.

281
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,481
Very sexy-

282
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,003
Pooh Bear, what happened to you?

283
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,565
It's nothing. Listen...

284
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,685
No, baby, it doesn't look like nothing.
Oh, my gosh. Come sit down.

285
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,443
Aw, my big, tough police-captain baby.

286
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,483
- Can I make it all okay...
- No. No, no. Listen to me.

287
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,245
We can't see each other for a while.

288
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,441
What?

289
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,648
Yeah, it's a thing I got into.

290
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,365
I owe some guys some money.

291
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,206
You gamble? Mr. Straight and Narrow?

292
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,330
Yeah, it helped me cope
after I quit drinking.

293
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,804
And I've pissed off
some pretty tough customers and...

294
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,803
Wait a minute, wait, honey,
please, please, I'm a Vegas girl, okay?

295
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,761
Whomever you owe money to

296
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:39,249
is gonna have to get up pretty early
in the morning to take me on.

297
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,521
So, don't worry.

298
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,210
Sweetheart, it's a little more
complicated than that.

299
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,051
Just for a few weeks. That's all.

300
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,121
That's it.

301
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:53,046
You know, how about we make it longer?

302
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,527
- What?
- My ex-husband was a lying son of a bitch.

303
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,605
Only two good things
came out of that marriage,

304
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,689
my daughter and my BS detector,
which is flawless.

305
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,043
And right now, yeah, it's redlining.

306
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,321
Donna, you, don't... Please...

307
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,211
Don't... Oh, my God. Don't "Donna" me.

308
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,844
You know what?
This is actually very simple.

309
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,325
You either respect me enough
to tell me the truth, or you don't.

310
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,810
Clearly, you don't.

311
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,244
Donna, please...

312
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,046
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, honey.

313
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,890
I'm fine.

314
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,881
What did you do?

315
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,644
Why you think it's me
that did something?

316
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,086
Because you're a man.

317
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:38,889
I'm trying to put some distance between us
in case Darhk is after me,

318
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,731
because I can't stand the idea
of anything happening to her, Felicity.

319
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,285
Yeah, but she looked pretty upset.

320
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,646
Yeah.

321
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,921
Oliver's not here.

322
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,168
I was looking for you.

323
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,811
I found something.

324
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,248
The 602 didn't come from
SCPD dispatch at all.

325
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,090
Someone just made it look like it did.

326
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,884
That someone being HIVE, you're thinking.

327
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,121
There's an encryption on it

328
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,011
that uses the same cipher of a HIVE
sat phone that Merlyn gave us.

329
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,929
- One more time.
- They lured you to the hotel.

330
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,451
Do we know where the call came from?

331
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,165
Price and 14th.

332
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,930
Bunch of other calls
came from there as well.

333
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,246
<i>I'm guessing
it's their base of operations.</i>

334
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,249
Okay. Contact the team,
and have them meet me there.

335
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,441
Yep.

336
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,081
Split up.

337
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,766
Job seems easy enough.

338
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,964
Don't get cocky.
Darhk won't tolerate another screw-up.

339
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,565
Where's Jack?

340
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:41,921
<i>"HARDHAT". Patrolling.</i>

341
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,400
Why?

342
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,961
Ahh!

343
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,284
Blow it! Let's move!

344
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,326
Go, go, 90!

345
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,685
They're demoing the factory,
just like they did the hotel.

346
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,729
You guys go get Spartan, okay?
I'm gonna get the laptop.

347
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,285
Speedy 'N0.go!

348
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:42,883
Hey, can you walk?

349
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,404
I don't have much of a choice.

350
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,881
- Where's Speedy?
- Right behind us.

351
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,730
Please tell me that the nails
are the clue,

352
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,206
and not what's on the laptop's hard drive

353
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,721
because there are three nails running
straight through this thing.

354
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,571
Yeah, the bad guys went a little crazy
with that nail gun.

355
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:31,570
Yeah, according to Andy,
they're called the Demolition Team.

356
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,048
Former GRU, IRA, and Mossad.

357
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,208
They're experts in precision demolition.

358
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,965
Now they work for HIVE.

359
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,083
I got a look at the laptop
before it got shot up,

360
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,970
and there were blueprints on the screen.

361
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,884
So they are gonna take down
another building.

362
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,121
Felicity?

363
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,487
I know. The first time we met,

364
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,002
the first thing you asked me to do
is pull data off a damaged laptop.

365
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,201
It's kind of romantic.

366
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,646
In case the laptop is a dead end,

367
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,724
lam going to work up
a list of potential targets.

368
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,210
Yeah, Andy is supposed to
get some more intel.

369
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,561
I'll see if he's made any progress.

370
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,401
Huh. Mom.

371
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,449
Wonder what took her so long.

372
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,524
What was that about?

373
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,449
Donna called it quits.

374
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,644
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

375
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,569
Yeah, yeah, me too.

376
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,651
You're lucky you're with someone
you don't need to keep secrets from.

377
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,722
Are these really necessary?

378
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,922
Can't risk you jeopardizing
your life again.

379
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,400
You're much too important.

380
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,400
You know, you keep saying that to me,
but I have no idea what you mean.

381
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,443
Do you believe in destiny, Mr. Queen?

382
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,165
I prefer the idea of free will.

383
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,170
This map conceals deeper truths.

384
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,931
Secrets I couldn't uncover
without more information,

385
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,124
until you brought these to me.

386
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,641
Except, I didn't bring them to you.

387
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,171
Conklin took them.

388
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,731
Destiny, Mr. Queen.

389
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,726
With the survey maps' details,

390
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:58,367
I was able to decipher
the inscriptions on this,

391
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,208
which you also provided me.

392
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,049
Are you beginning to see it now,
the pattern?

393
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,203
The trend of providence?

394
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,290
Legend tells of a hidden place,

395
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,683
within which lies
a device of untold power.

396
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,888
The quest to find it requires one
who has been granted passage by the gods.

397
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,363
I believe that person is you.

398
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,522
Hey, you're needed upstairs.

399
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,365
Keep Mr. Queen company till I return.

400
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,291
We still have much to discuss.

401
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,567
All this magic mumbo jumbo.

402
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,050
<i>The way it saved your neck with Reiter,</i>

403
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,044
maybe I ought to start
believing in it, myself.

404
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,050
Ain't easy
when it looks like toilet paper.

405
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,484
Boy, you got some balls.

406
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,249
I'm gonna enjoy watching you die.

407
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,844
I am... I...

408
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,322
Ugh. I didn't want to bother you
when you walked in on us

409
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,449
at Oliver's campaign office, but I'm...

410
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,766
It's okay.

411
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,684
No, honey, no. No, it's not.

412
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,968
- It's actually not okay.
- It's okay.

413
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:18,921
After your father, after all these years,
I thought I finally found the one man

414
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,087
who wouldn't lie to me, okay?

415
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,924
Maybe he's got a good reason.

416
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,606
Yeah. Right.

417
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:32,762
Honey, I want you to know
that I'm really sorry

418
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,127
that I've been going all Momzilla
for this engagement party...

419
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,004
Momzilla.

420
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:40,763
Do you want to know why
I pushed the tiaras and...

421
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,690
The ten-tiered cake?

422
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,804
Well, that's because you've loved
princesses since before you could walk.

423
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,610
Yes, that, and, um...

424
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,651
I've been living vicariously
through you.

425
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,291
You and Oliver are one of those couples

426
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,650
that everyone believes in.

427
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,967
You don't lie to each other.

428
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,121
Even

429
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,561
And he's gonna be the best daddy
in the whole world

430
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,962
- when that time comes.
- Ah.

431
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,571
You know that, don't you?

432
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,086
In my bones.

433
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,086
And when I see something that beautiful

434
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,890
and that rare and that romantic,

435
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,481
it also reminds me that,

436
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:30,207
you know, I'm never gonna
find a love like that.

437
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,561
Yes, you will.

438
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,770
You have it now with Captain Lance.

439
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,531
No, honey, no.
Not if he's hiding something from me.

440
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,643
Maybe he's doing it to protect you.

441
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,728
Because he loves you.

442
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:47,164
And you need to return that love
with a little bit of trust.

443
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,571
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

444
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,210
Crime, health care, taxes,
business incentives,

445
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,880
you've actually
pretty much nailed them all.

446
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,646
Stop sounding so surprised, please.

447
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,002
Well, I mean, you did spend
your education nailing chicks,

448
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,885
not doing social studies.

449
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,646
Okay. I'm sort of wiped.

450
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,281
- Can we wrap this up, maybe?
- Um...

451
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,008
Yeah, I did just have
one more question for you.

452
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,201
Okay.

453
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,330
Why didn't you tell me you went to college
with Samantha Clayton?

454
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,441
I was with Samantha Clayton

455
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,370
while I was dating Laurel.

456
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,681
And I'm not proud of that, so...

457
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,123
So why did Mom pay her a million dollars?

458
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,084
Thea, I told you, Mom is...

459
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,487
Ollie, I, um... I looked her up.

460
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,644
Right after you guys broke up,
she moved to Central City.

461
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,844
She's got a son

462
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,607
named William.

463
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,882
- Who's about as old as that check is...
- Okay, Thea.

464
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:57,208
When we were in Central City,

465
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:02,327
I knew something was bothering you,
and I knew it just wasn't Vandal Savage.

466
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,849
I mean, now it makes sense.

467
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,204
William's your son, isn't he?

468
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,561
Yes, he is.

469
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,728
Why haven't you told anyone?

470
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:15,845
Because Samantha said that
the only way that I could see him

471
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:20,409
is if I promised to not tell him,
or anyone else, that I'm his father.

472
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,204
God, that's...

473
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,523
That is brutal. Are you okay?

474
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,563
I thought I was doing okay.

475
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,491
I spent a lot of time
convincing myself that I was...

476
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:34,082
That I was trying to do
the right thing, but then,

477
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,251
you know, you brought this,
the thing with the check, and I'm not...

478
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,363
It's not your fault, but it's...

479
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:43,046
You bring it up right when we're trying
to plan an engagement party.

480
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,608
So, I'm left to think,
"How can I marry Felicity"

481
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,041
"if there is this lie between us?"

482
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,844
It's not a lie.

483
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,965
Okay? It's a promise that you are keeping
to the mother of your child...

484
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,889
Doesn't make it right, Thea.

485
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,889
Look at it from Samantha's perspective.

486
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,366
As far as she knows,

487
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,847
- you are a rich playboy...
- Right.

488
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:06,004
Who slept with a bunch of women,
and got her pregnant.

489
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,964
I'm not that person anymore.

490
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,286
Now you're the Green Arrow.

491
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:12,643
Anyone who comes into your life
is automatically a target.

492
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,126
What Samantha is asking for you to do...

493
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,369
As hard as it may be,
it is the right thing to do.

494
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,164
I know you want to tell Felicity...

495
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,969
And trust me, I would love to be an aunt.

496
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,961
But you have got to do the right thing
for your son here.

497
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,844
As hard as this may be for you, Ollie,

498
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,524
keeping William a secret
is keeping him safe.

499
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,486
Yes, John.

500
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,648
Andy did a little digging on the dark web.

501
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,167
Found out the Demolition Team
uses a specialized acid

502
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,124
that can weaken building structures.

503
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,322
Only one warehouse in the city stocks it.

504
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,648
- Text me the address, I'll be right there.
- I'm coming with you.

505
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,844
No, no, no. Just...
It's a long shot, at best.

506
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,771
- Thea.
- Yeah?

507
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,368
- Thank you.
- For what?

508
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,722
Just saying what I needed to hear.

509
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,724
I'll clear the area.

510
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,445
Too late. They cleaned this place out.

511
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,483
Yeah, took 100 gallons
of that acid with them.

512
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,205
Whatever they plan on taking down...

513
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,561
ls massive.

514
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,091
Hey! Uh, hope I'm not bothering you. I...

515
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,649
Uh, Curtis, why is my face
your screen saver?

516
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,367
At the risk of early termination,
uh, none of your business.

517
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,971
- Curtis!
- Please don't ask.

518
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,889
I'm, like, super bad with secrets.

519
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,969
Okay. It's an early wedding gift,

520
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,680
but it's really bad luck if you see it,
so, please stop trying to see it.

521
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,723
Okay, I think you're getting
your wedding traditions confused,

522
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,921
but fine, I will let it go.

523
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,606
Lucky for you,
I have more important concerns.

524
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,246
I maxed out the computer power
in the lair, again,

525
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,408
and I was hoping maybe your mainframe
might have better luck.

526
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,645
- I'll do my best.
- Thank you.

527
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,563
Really, me on a screen saver, hmm?

528
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,882
Whatever the surprise is,
it better be good.

529
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,411
Oh, it will be.

530
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,251
Well, that's not
your typical nighttime suit.

531
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,209
You're the reason I'm wearing it.

532
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,929
Inspiring me to save this city
in the light of day.

533
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,521
Fine inspiration I turned out to be,
hiding down here in the dark.

534
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,721
For your protection.

535
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:44,811
You haven't told Donna, have you?

536
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,481
No.

537
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,406
How you kept this up
for four years, huh?

538
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,206
This double life,
these secrets, lying, I mean...

539
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,482
I'm trying not to live that way anymore.

540
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,641
Trying.

541
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,841
<i>You know in AA,</i>

542
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,611
we say you're only as sick
as the secrets you keep.

543
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,005
You're looking pretty healthy these days.

544
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,241
And I just hope I can get back
to that place with Donna.

545
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,851
For what it's worth,
you're in a tough spot,

546
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,530
and you're trying to keep her safe.

547
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,090
You know, sometimes, a lie isn't wrong

548
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,681
when it's for the good
of someone that you love.

549
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,122
Just so you know, after I'm done with you,

550
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,169
I'ma gut that slave girl, just for kicks.

551
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,890
All the rest of 'em, too.

552
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,481
You're never hurting them ever again.

553
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,531
There he is. There's the killer.

554
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,402
You stupid son of a bitch.

555
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,646
Reiter's gonna kill everyone
no matter what you do.

556
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,800
So, Ruvé's probably gonna question you
on your party-boy past,

557
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,081
but if she does we just gotta...

558
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,527
If she does, just steer the conversation
back towards the issues.

559
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,721
- I've got it.
- Yep.

560
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,969
Alex's mom kind of picked the wrong week
to go in for surgery, don't you think?

561
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,486
I couldn't agree more.

562
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,165
We got about 20 minutes until we're live,
so, how're you feeling?

563
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,966
Are you nervous at all or...

564
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:24,084
You know, I don't think that "nervous"
is in Oliver's vocabulary.

565
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,601
Yes, but "translucent matte powder"
should be.

566
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:30,811
You don't want to shine under
those big bright lights.

567
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,481
Hey, why do we... No.

568
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,609
Why do we even need makeup?
We're not even gonna be onstage.

569
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,484
Reaction shots, sweetie.
Plus, I just... I love makeup.

570
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,364
- Mom, Mom, Mom!
- What?

571
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,931
- I gotta take this.
- Oh, okay.

572
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,451
You know what? I'm gonna be right back.

573
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,927
I hate this. It's a horrible powder puff.
It's just... It's awful.

574
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,121
That was fast.

575
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,370
You sound surprised. I don't know
whether to be flattered or insulted.

576
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,881
<i>- Okay, Curtis. What did you get?
- Not</i> much. <i>Just</i> a <i>set of blueprints.</i>

577
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:54,323
Pretty underwhelming, considering.
I'm uploading it to you now.

578
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,370
Curtis, I gotta call you back.
Oliver, I need you.

579
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,801
What's wrong?

580
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,129
I know what building
HIVE is planning on taking down.

581
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,560
It's this one.

582
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,366
<i>Okay,
I have a million questions.</i>

583
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,324
But first, why would HIVE
try to attack the debate?

584
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,284
To take me out and discourage
anyone else from running.

585
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,289
Okay. But Darhk's wife is here
at ground zero.

586
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,726
So it doesn't really make sense to...

587
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:22,481
Unless Darhk's demolition team is
gonna wipe everyone out except for Ruvé.

588
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,364
Leaving Mrs. Darhk a sympathetic survivor

589
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,688
instead of the pot of evil stew
that she actually is.

590
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,087
Can you identify the likely areas
the bombs would be in?

591
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,481
Yeah, according to the schematics,

592
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,091
it's these three points.
But this building, it's huge.

593
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,321
We need to split up and cover more ground.

594
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,851
Okay, good thing
we brought a change of clothes.

595
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,161
Call Laurel and Diggle.

596
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:38,601
Can you hack the fire alarm?
We need to evacuate the building.

597
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,006
It's an old system.
It might take me a minute.

598
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,284
Yeah, I learned that in high school.

599
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,041
So, we could...

600
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,482
<i>Listen to me very carefully.</i>

601
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,764
<i>Change of plans.</i>

602
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,170
<i>Do not let Oliver Queen
leave this building alive.</i>

603
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,371
Copy that.

604
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,044
Hey, I finally found it.
Where's Oliver and Thea?

605
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,362
Oh, they're probably just inside
making sure everyone gets out okay.

606
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,484
You left them inside? Honey, come on,
we need to go help them. Let's go.

607
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,170
- Excuse me. Outta the way.
- Excuse us.

608
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,522
Captain Lance,
you're supposed to be... Not here.

609
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,008
What kind of cop sits on the sidelines
when people's lives are at risk?

610
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,280
You stay here.

611
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,407
<i>I count three charges, but no Demo Team.</i>

612
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,647
<i>What do you see?</i>

613
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,729
Same here. No hostiles.

614
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,922
<i>"SPEEDY". Lots of ticky-tocky bombs.</i>

615
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,246
More charges down here.

616
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,930
I see the countdown.
13:25 until detonation.

617
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,167
That's two minutes
after the debate starts.

618
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,725
<i>We need to disarm these things.</i>

619
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,086
Disarming one now.

620
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,521
I hope this neutralizing agent works.

621
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,081
Ahh!

622
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,925
- You okay?
- Yeah.

623
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,724
The place is booby-trapped.
Be careful up there.

624
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,969
Or don't. It's not polite to touch things
that ain't yours.

625
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,322
Yeah, you're not the only one with tricks.

626
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,607
Watch out!

627
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,287
Speedy!

628
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,401
We're clear.

629
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,331
It's clear down here, too.

630
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,560
Top is clear. Thanks.

631
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,321
Sure you should be out in the open?

632
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,090
Don't you have somewhere to be
right about now?

633
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,728
I checked the cafeteria,
the green room, everywhere.

634
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,400
Everywhere except
for the bathroom, apparently.

635
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,921
Sorry. Nervous bladder, I think.

636
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,566
Oh, that was something
I never needed to hear, ever.

637
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,764
- Um, are you ready to go?
- More than.

638
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:46,131
<i>All right, come on, buddy.
Come on.</i>

639
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,443
Captain Lance never lets his man get away.

640
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,209
You shouldn't either.

641
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:05,961
Nice applause.

642
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,730
It's enough to bring the house down.

643
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,961
Almost.

644
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,246
Good luck.

645
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,325
<i>Despite a bomb threat, tonight's
mayoral debate then went on as scheduled</i>

646
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:31,281
<i>with Mr. Queen being declared,
by most pundits, the clear winner.</i>

647
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,609
Oh! Of course he's the clear winner.
He's marrying my daughter.

648
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,325
Well, I think you're a little biased.

649
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,443
Did Alex call with the new poll numbers?

650
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,369
Well, if Bethany Snow is right,
he doesn't have to.

651
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,608
Experts are saying that you already won.

652
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,365
- Experts aren't the voters.
- Okay.

653
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,528
Well, you at least have one voter
in your camp.

654
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,128
- Me!
- Only one that matters.

655
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,321
Mmm.

656
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,162
Conklin may have had his difficulties,
but he was a good man.

657
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:00,086
Yeah. He was a good man who attacked me.

658
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,607
- Self-defense.
- As it was with her brother?

659
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,525
I'm not saying it lacks irony.

660
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,247
I need you alive, Mr. Queen.

661
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,362
But there are different forms of alive.

662
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,766
Don't test me again.

663
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,001
You did it.

664
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,442
- What was that for?
- Thank you.

665
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,170
I don't need thanks, Taiana.

666
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:37,410
Before he died, Conklin told me

667
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:40,649
that Reiter was gonna kill everybody here.

668
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:45,050
We don't have much time.

669
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,281
Thank you.

670
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,046
Uh, John, can I introduce you
to Laura Hoffman?

671
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,729
- Laura.
- Oh, don't mind if I do. John, hi.

672
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,010
Laura was our neighbor in Ivy Town.
She drove all day to get here.

673
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,850
Please. The drive was nothing.

674
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,123
I've been waiting five months
for this moment to finally arrive.

675
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,051
Oh, hey, have you started
your wedding registry yet?

676
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,084
Because I may very well have
the perfect gift idea for you.

677
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,408
Oh, let me guess. Slow cooker?

678
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,721
HOW did she...

679
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,490
- How did you know that?
- I'm telepathic.

680
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,445
Excuse me, sorry to interrupt,
but I need you both.

681
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,051
Photographer is here.

682
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,928
- Did you invite him?
- Who? Me? Uh...

683
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,444
- Sorry, could I talk to you for a minute?
- Yes, absolutely.

684
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,641
- Felicity...
- What?

685
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,251
The photographer's right over there.

686
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,681
We will make it there just fine
by ourselves.

687
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:40,203
- Captain.
- Nice to see you.

688
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,643
Please.

689
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:46,168
Thanks. It's quite the party
you've got going on here.

690
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,563
What? What?
What do you want to talk about?

691
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,566
Well, I came here to apologize
because you were right. l...

692
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,807
I lied to you.

693
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,686
Because I was afraid
of how you would react to the truth.

694
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,049
That thing that I was worried about?

695
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,090
- It wasn't a gambling problem.
- It was HIVE.

696
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,760
The same people that...

697
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,689
- The same people that hurt my baby?
- Mmm.

698
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,645
Why wouldn't you tell me that?

699
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,524
'Cause I'm not in their gun sights
'cause I'm police.

700
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,688
I'm in their gun sights
'cause I stopped working for them.

701
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,845
You were working with Damien Darhk?

702
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,644
He threatened Laurel.

703
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,489
And the truth is,

704
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,690
I'm glad Darhk came after me and not her,
because if he'd done that, I...

705
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,041
You were protecting her.

706
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,449
Just like you were protecting me.

707
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,521
Well, I'll be...

708
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:40,926
- I'm so sorry.
- No.

709
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,731
Ah...

710
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,809
Is it possible to go blind
from too many flashes?

711
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,002
Take a little bit of a break.
Just for a moment.

712
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,366
I literally can't see a thing right now.

713
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,562
I think the cure for that is champagne.

714
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,764
Ah! Dr. Queen, I do believe you are right.

715
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,571
Curtis! Paul!

716
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,849
<i>So glad you guys made it.</i>

717
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,208
Quick. Grab a glass of this champagne.

718
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,528
Careful, he might drink the entire bottle.

719
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,609
- I like my bubbly, what can I say?
- Mmm-hmm.

720
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,121
Uh-uh-uh.

721
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,125
Mixing a downer with all the coffee
you've had in the last <i>72</i> hours?

722
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,367
Your head might explode.

723
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,722
Yeah, I have been pulling
a lot of crazy hours.

724
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:20,762
After my surprise was blown on my gift,
I wanted to finish it as soon as possible.

725
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:32,244
Thanks. We forgot to register
for microchips.

726
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:37,844
Actually, it's neither micro nor chip.
It's an implantable bio-stimulant.

727
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:41,766
And why would I need
an implantable bio-stimulant?

728
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,963
For walking.

729
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,321
Curtis...

730
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,966
In the perfect world, it'll work in time
for you to walk down the aisle.

731
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,846
I mean, but it's pretty cutting-edge,
and so I can't promise anything.

732
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,089
You're telling me that this little piece
of technology is gonna help me walk again?

733
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,123
After it's implanted in your spine, yes.

734
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,369
<i>He's been trying
to crack it for a while,</i>

735
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,729
but he needed a power source,
something that would last a lifetime.

736
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,763
- Palmer Technologies' power cell.
- Exactly.

737
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,804
Once I solved that,
I knew this might actually work.

738
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,411
Oh, my God.

739
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,525
I don't know what to say.

740
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,321
I do.

741
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:24,526
Curtis, you're terrific. Thank you.

742
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,644
No. Well, don't thank me yet.
It still has to work.

743
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,611
It'll work. I know it will.
You, come with me.

744
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,844
We're about to make my mother very happy.

745
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,802
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, sweetie.

746
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,843
Nora, honey,
there's someone I'd like you to meet.

747
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,041
Nora, this is William.

748
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,969
William's mother asked us
to look after him.

749
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,049
He'll be staying with us for a while.

750
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,321
Nice to meet you, William.

751
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,363
- You want to play?
- Sure.

752
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,721
English - SDH
