1
00:00:00,068 --> 00:00:01,467
Previously on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:01,469 --> 00:00:03,495
Mr. Ramirez suffered
a traumatic hemothorax.

3
00:00:03,496 --> 00:00:05,782
I'm recommending
he be transferred to a facility

4
00:00:05,783 --> 00:00:07,282
that can provide
the care he needs.

5
00:00:07,283 --> 00:00:08,816
- Where's my dad?
- Have a seat.

6
00:00:08,817 --> 00:00:10,452
He's gonna be ok,

7
00:00:10,453 --> 00:00:11,853
but I need to tell you
about it.

8
00:00:11,854 --> 00:00:13,854
- Unh!
- Want to keep going,

9
00:00:13,856 --> 00:00:16,023
or are you
gonna testify?

10
00:00:18,327 --> 00:00:19,593
We're leaving.

11
00:00:19,595 --> 00:00:20,927
I've seen
what having Felicity

12
00:00:20,929 --> 00:00:22,462
in my life
has done for me.

13
00:00:22,464 --> 00:00:25,198
You deserve that
same kind of happiness.

14
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,071
I've located the heir
of Ra's al Ghul.

15
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,916
So where are we going?

16
00:00:42,918 --> 00:00:44,818
Wherever you want.

17
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,886
It's up to me?

18
00:00:45,888 --> 00:00:47,454
I'm the
well-traveled man.

19
00:00:47,456 --> 00:00:48,889
I've been every place
in the world there is.

20
00:00:48,891 --> 00:00:51,024
But you want to get
out of here

21
00:00:51,026 --> 00:00:52,926
because if the police
knew you were alive,

22
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:54,928
they'd come after you.

23
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,363
The Arrow, too.

24
00:00:56,365 --> 00:00:57,964
Yes.

25
00:00:57,966 --> 00:01:00,467
If someone knew
where I was,

26
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:03,670
it would be unfortunate
for both of us.

27
00:01:03,672 --> 00:01:05,539
So why did you reach
out to me?

28
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:10,010
I don't want to hurt
or get hurt. Never again.

29
00:01:10,012 --> 00:01:12,479
I can teach you to be strong
in heart and body.

30
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:14,047
I can teach you
to protect yourself

31
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:15,916
so no one will ever
hurt you again.

32
00:01:15,918 --> 00:01:18,552
That's what every father
wants for his daughter.

33
00:01:37,873 --> 00:01:41,108
Malcolm Merlyn's legacy
lives on.

34
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:43,076
This is a new dawn.

35
00:01:43,078 --> 00:01:47,280
Al Sa-Her was going to
bestow on us a new golden age

36
00:01:47,282 --> 00:01:50,951
and lead us
into the realm of Thanatos,

37
00:01:50,953 --> 00:01:56,990
yet for what greatness
Merlyn possessed in his soul

38
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,726
he lost in his heart.

39
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:02,462
He swore that our great journey
would be nothing

40
00:02:02,464 --> 00:02:04,631
without his blood legacy
at our side,

41
00:02:04,633 --> 00:02:07,634
and thus before
he gave up his life,

42
00:02:07,636 --> 00:02:10,270
he made sure this journey
could not commence

43
00:02:10,272 --> 00:02:13,106
until his beloved
was ready.

44
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:18,745
Step forward.

45
00:02:26,989 --> 00:02:28,922
I have to say

46
00:02:28,924 --> 00:02:31,992
the new uniforms
do not impress me.

47
00:02:31,994 --> 00:02:36,029
We have cleansed ourselves
of your father's sins

48
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:38,231
for our rebirth,

49
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:40,200
which couldn't be further
from your fate,

50
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:41,968
daughter of the Demon.

51
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:47,007
I would so relish slitting
your throat, Athena.

52
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:48,809
One thing we have
in common.

53
00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:52,012
Except I've grown a taste
for the contemporary...

54
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:56,116
such as plastic explosives.

Oh, my gosh. You'd be

59
00:03:35,457 --> 00:03:37,457
if your dad saw
you doing that.

You're lucky you have such a cool

who approves
of bad behavior.

- I'm gonna miss you.
- And I'm gonna miss you, too.

63
00:03:45,033 --> 00:03:47,734
Just promise me that
you're gonna watch over your dad, ok?

64
00:03:47,736 --> 00:03:49,169
But he's the Green Arrow.

65
00:03:49,171 --> 00:03:51,037
You know, before he was
the Green Arrow,

66
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:53,039
he actually used to be
really afraid of the dark,

67
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,474
and he needed
a nightlight in his bedroom

68
00:03:54,476 --> 00:03:56,409
till he was, like,
what, six--16?

69
00:03:56,411 --> 00:03:59,112
It was not a nightli--
I was--

70
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:00,714
it was not a nightlight.

71
00:04:00,716 --> 00:04:02,296
I couldn't sleep
with it being pitch black.

72
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,008
By the way, I did see that.
Go get a fork

73
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:06,009
and a--and a plate
and get yourself

74
00:04:06,011 --> 00:04:07,944
a reasonable slice
of cake.

75
00:04:07,946 --> 00:04:09,279
Yes.

76
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:11,281
Thank you
for doing this.

77
00:04:11,283 --> 00:04:13,950
It's actually
pretty cool.

78
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,252
Why do you sound
surprised?

79
00:04:16,254 --> 00:04:17,520
Yeah. I--I don't know.
I just thought that

80
00:04:17,522 --> 00:04:19,089
maybe you would--

81
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:21,424
you'd be a little more
anti me going.

82
00:04:21,426 --> 00:04:23,393
I'm the one who encouraged
you to go follow your heart.

83
00:04:23,395 --> 00:04:26,229
I know, I know.
It's just that now that it's all real,

84
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:27,997
I just--I...

85
00:04:27,999 --> 00:04:31,301
I thought that maybe
you would be, like, a tad less supportive.

86
00:04:31,303 --> 00:04:34,337
I am completely supportive
of anything and everything

87
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:36,306
that makes you happy.

88
00:04:36,308 --> 00:04:38,041
Speaking of which,
I did tell Roy

89
00:04:38,043 --> 00:04:39,909
that the two times
that I shot him with--with arrows

90
00:04:39,911 --> 00:04:41,344
would be nothing compared
to what would happen to him

91
00:04:41,346 --> 00:04:42,879
if you end up unhappy.

92
00:04:42,881 --> 00:04:44,414
- Ah. Yeah.
- Do you understand...?

93
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,316
I spy an overbearing
big brother.

94
00:04:46,318 --> 00:04:48,585
Yeah. No, no.
He's never been like that.

95
00:04:48,587 --> 00:04:50,286
Never. Never.

96
00:04:50,288 --> 00:04:51,888
I know we've said it
a million times,

97
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,256
but we're gonna
miss you.

98
00:04:53,258 --> 00:04:55,258
We're really
going to miss you.

99
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,893
Well, you guys have
to come visit us

100
00:04:56,895 --> 00:04:58,428
once we find out
where we're gonna land.

101
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,829
Where do we think
that's gonna be?

102
00:04:59,831 --> 00:05:01,331
Well, we don't
really know exactly,

103
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,299
but that--that's kind
of the best part.

104
00:05:03,301 --> 00:05:06,002
I mean, we're gonna figure it out
as we go along.

105
00:05:06,004 --> 00:05:08,771
Oh. That's so spontaneous
and romantic.

106
00:05:08,773 --> 00:05:10,607
As long as we're together,
that's really all that matters, right?

107
00:05:10,609 --> 00:05:12,809
- Heh.
- Heh heh.

108
00:05:12,811 --> 00:05:14,244
So how's your
new roommate?

109
00:05:14,246 --> 00:05:16,179
She's just as messy
as my Laurel,

110
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:19,315
but, uh, surprisingly,
she's a better cook.

111
00:05:19,317 --> 00:05:21,351
- You trust her, Lance.
- I'm not stupid, you know.

112
00:05:21,353 --> 00:05:23,586
I--I know who she is.
I know what she's done,

113
00:05:23,588 --> 00:05:27,123
but, you know, she says she's--
she's trying to get better,

114
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:30,360
and, you know,
that Intel she gave you last week

115
00:05:30,362 --> 00:05:33,329
on, uh, Diaz,
that panned out.

116
00:05:33,331 --> 00:05:34,697
Yeah. He still got away.

117
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:36,699
Don't they always,
though?

118
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:38,501
I see a--
ahem--work conversation,

119
00:05:38,503 --> 00:05:41,371
so where are we
with the SCPD?

120
00:05:41,373 --> 00:05:44,440
Well, uh, Dinah and Curtis,
they're growing a list

121
00:05:44,442 --> 00:05:46,309
of possible cops
on the take,

122
00:05:46,311 --> 00:05:48,278
but that could end up being
the least of our worries.

123
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,780
- How so?
- The D.A.'s office's refusal

124
00:05:50,782 --> 00:05:52,715
to drop your case
without Roy's testimony,

125
00:05:52,717 --> 00:05:54,384
that doesn't sit
right with me.

126
00:05:54,386 --> 00:05:56,219
And who's to say that
the SCPD's the only part

127
00:05:56,221 --> 00:05:58,388
of the city's power structure
that Diaz has got

128
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,822
his fingers in.

129
00:05:59,824 --> 00:06:02,292
Yeah. Oliver, you let me
worry about Diaz.

130
00:06:02,294 --> 00:06:03,960
You spend a little more time
with your sister

131
00:06:03,962 --> 00:06:05,862
before she gets
out of here.

132
00:06:05,864 --> 00:06:07,397
And you think this guy's
gonna stop worrying

133
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:08,898
about things
all of a sudden?

134
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,000
Well, ever since he trusted
me to take over.

135
00:06:11,002 --> 00:06:13,403
If that's still
on the table.

136
00:06:13,405 --> 00:06:16,206
I'm gonna go grab
some cake.

137
00:06:19,411 --> 00:06:20,910
You brought this
up last week.

138
00:06:20,912 --> 00:06:22,812
I don't know, man.
I thought we were clear.

139
00:06:22,814 --> 00:06:25,848
You wanted out,
I wanted in.

140
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:28,351
- Has something changed?
- Yeah.

141
00:06:28,353 --> 00:06:30,286
Yeah. It's--it's just
you and me,

142
00:06:30,288 --> 00:06:33,656
and we don't know what Diaz has,
what he doesn't,

143
00:06:33,658 --> 00:06:39,629
and bottom line, I--I don't think that
it should be just you.

144
00:06:43,868 --> 00:06:45,935
This is definitely
one of the jerks

145
00:06:45,937 --> 00:06:47,537
who beat Roy
to a pulp last week.

146
00:06:47,539 --> 00:06:49,772
I wonder what food
they're serving

147
00:06:49,774 --> 00:06:51,407
at Thea and Roy's
good-bye party.

148
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:53,509
Pizza, apps--

149
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:55,578
heh--maybe, like,
some mini-desserts.

150
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,747
That's this new thing. Like, you go to a party,
and then they serve you

151
00:06:57,749 --> 00:06:59,749
these desserts, like mini doughnuts, and you
just dip them in the sauce.

152
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:02,085
I mean, that would be reason
enough to crash the party.

153
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:03,953
Not that I'm saying I want to
crash the party. I'm not expecting to be invited,

154
00:07:03,955 --> 00:07:05,455
but, you know, Felicity
is my business partner...

155
00:07:05,457 --> 00:07:07,557
- So I just--
- Curtis, focus.

156
00:07:07,559 --> 00:07:09,459
We need to find out
how many of these cops are dirty.

157
00:07:09,461 --> 00:07:10,827
Well, officer Hester
makes 10.

158
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:13,029
Yeah, and counting.

159
00:07:13,031 --> 00:07:14,764
You know, the more
cops who are dirty,

160
00:07:14,766 --> 00:07:17,300
the harder it is to
believe Captain Hill didn't know.

161
00:07:17,302 --> 00:07:19,936
Who's next?

162
00:07:19,938 --> 00:07:21,638
- Nick Anastas.
- Hoo.

163
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,407
More like hotnastas. Wow!

164
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:26,309
Well, just because you
have the hots for him

165
00:07:26,311 --> 00:07:28,144
doesn't mean he's not
on Diaz's payroll.

166
00:07:28,146 --> 00:07:30,079
All--all his stats
check out.

167
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:32,081
He hasn't had any
influxes of cash into his account,

168
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,883
no pressure points
for blackmail.

169
00:07:33,885 --> 00:07:36,119
Look. I'm just saying
you never mentioned to me

170
00:07:36,121 --> 00:07:39,088
that you work with such
a hot police officer,

171
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,490
not even once.

172
00:07:40,492 --> 00:07:42,458
I guess I never
noticed.

173
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:44,627
Yeah, just like you don't
notice beautiful sunsets and rainbows.

174
00:07:44,629 --> 00:07:48,464
Look. You just don't
see beauty as--hey, Z.!

175
00:07:48,466 --> 00:07:49,966
How was school?

176
00:07:49,968 --> 00:07:51,834
- Good. Hi, Dinah.
- What's up, Zoe?

177
00:07:51,836 --> 00:07:53,970
Feeling like some
Mac and cheese tonight?

178
00:07:53,972 --> 00:07:55,538
- Again?
- Can you get sick

179
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:57,006
of Mac and cheese?

180
00:07:57,008 --> 00:07:59,676
- Definitely getting there.
- Oh, come on.

181
00:07:59,678 --> 00:08:02,312
Going to my room
to do homework.

182
00:08:02,314 --> 00:08:04,247
Heh heh.

183
00:08:04,249 --> 00:08:06,616
You two seem to be
getting along well.

184
00:08:06,618 --> 00:08:09,485
Yeah. You know, it's nice having
a little munchkin around.

185
00:08:09,487 --> 00:08:11,988
Well, I'm sure Rene
appreciates somebody he trusts

186
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,790
taking care of her.

187
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:15,458
Yeah. You know, he
should be starting rehab soon.

188
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,160
Hopefully, he'll be back
to normal ASAP.

189
00:08:17,162 --> 00:08:18,695
I really, really
miss that guy.

190
00:08:18,697 --> 00:08:19,996
Me, too.

191
00:08:19,998 --> 00:08:21,030
Hey. It's your boyfriend...

192
00:08:22,367 --> 00:08:23,399
Anastas.

193
00:08:23,401 --> 00:08:24,667
Homicide. Got to go.

194
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:26,302
You keep digging.

195
00:08:26,304 --> 00:08:28,571
I got to find out who
at work I can trust.

196
00:08:28,573 --> 00:08:30,873
He's not my boyfriend yet.

197
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,575

200
00:08:39,884 --> 00:08:41,884
Yeah. I can't

Ok. That wasn't
so convincing.

Look, Thea.
I--I'm thrilled.

Ok, and since when do you

217

Nyssa, what--
what is going on?

218
00:09:30,502 --> 00:09:32,668
- We need to move.
- What, are there more coming?

219
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,270
Many more. These
are the scouts.

220
00:09:34,272 --> 00:09:36,038
They look
like League of Assassins.

221
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,540
No. The League of Assassins
was disbanded.

222
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:38,741
This can't be them.

223
00:09:38,743 --> 00:09:40,243
Nothing stays dead
forever.

224
00:09:40,245 --> 00:09:41,878
Your father made
sure of that.

225
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,613
Ok. Well,
I--I don't care, ok?

226
00:09:43,615 --> 00:09:46,349
I'm--I'm sorry.
This is not me anymore.

227
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:48,351
I have nothing
to do with this.

228
00:09:48,353 --> 00:09:50,586
Like me, you are
an heiress to the Demon.

229
00:09:50,588 --> 00:09:54,090
That is something
you can never truly run from.

230
00:10:00,216 --> 00:10:03,750
Hey. What happened?
Thea, are you hurt?

231
00:10:03,751 --> 00:10:05,751
No. I'm--I'm fine.
I'm ok.

232
00:10:05,752 --> 00:10:08,219
I'm doing pretty fine myself.
Thanks for asking.

233
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:10,455
They weren't
even at city limits, and they got attacked.

234
00:10:10,457 --> 00:10:11,856
That's because she
jinxed it.

235
00:10:11,858 --> 00:10:13,725
Superstition
played no part.

236
00:10:13,727 --> 00:10:15,760
I hear you've taken
my husband as your own.

237
00:10:15,762 --> 00:10:20,231
Yeah. Well, we can talk
about that later.

238
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:22,167
In the League, such talk
would take the form

239
00:10:22,169 --> 00:10:23,501
of mortal combat.

240
00:10:23,503 --> 00:10:25,236
What the hell
is going on?

241
00:10:25,238 --> 00:10:27,138
Apparently,
my dear old dad decided

242
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,907
to recruit some loyalists
before...

243
00:10:28,909 --> 00:10:30,842
Nyssa disbanded
the League.

244
00:10:30,844 --> 00:10:31,843
For what?

245
00:10:31,845 --> 00:10:33,178
To start his own,

246
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,779
the Thanatos Guild.

247
00:10:34,781 --> 00:10:36,448
Began hearing whispers
about them shortly

248
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,283
after we all returned
from Lian Yu.

249
00:10:38,285 --> 00:10:39,617
He couldn't have
led for long considering

250
00:10:39,619 --> 00:10:41,119
he didn't leave
the island.

251
00:10:41,121 --> 00:10:42,520
Moses never entered
the holy land,

252
00:10:42,522 --> 00:10:44,155
and yet his legacy endured.

253
00:10:44,157 --> 00:10:45,824
His second in command,
Athena, took charge,

254
00:10:45,826 --> 00:10:47,792
a contemporary
of mine and a rival.

255
00:10:47,794 --> 00:10:51,162
Her involvement alone suggests
a very dark purpose at work here.

256
00:10:51,164 --> 00:10:54,132
Why would this
guild attack Thea?

257
00:10:54,134 --> 00:10:56,301
Before Merlyn
gave up his life,

258
00:10:56,303 --> 00:10:57,769
he discovered
a map that leads

259
00:10:57,771 --> 00:11:00,338
to something
ancient, powerful.

260
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,877
I do not know what it is,
but I do know that he yearned

261
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:05,079
for Thea to be at his side
when he unearthed it.

262
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,081
It's really funny
he never mentioned this.

263
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,883
Because he knew you
were not ready.

264
00:11:08,885 --> 00:11:11,219
Athena believes Thea to either be
in possession of the map

265
00:11:11,221 --> 00:11:13,955
or at the very least have knowledge
of its whereabouts.

266
00:11:13,957 --> 00:11:16,591
Well, you have fun
on your treasure hunt, ok?

267
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:19,494
I told you.
You cannot run from this.

268
00:11:19,496 --> 00:11:23,531
Watch me, ok?
I--Roy and I are getting

269
00:11:23,533 --> 00:11:25,466
out of here and back
to our lives.

270
00:11:25,468 --> 00:11:27,268
I need your help
obtaining the map.

271
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,703
You cannot deny
your father's legacy

272
00:11:28,705 --> 00:11:31,172
any more than I can
deny mine.

273
00:11:31,174 --> 00:11:33,107
They will find you.

274
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,409
What do you want
from me?

275
00:11:34,411 --> 00:11:36,144
Merlyn had an associate
in Star City.

276
00:11:36,146 --> 00:11:37,912
If he shared the map's
location with anyone,

277
00:11:37,914 --> 00:11:39,313
it would have been
with her.

278
00:11:39,315 --> 00:11:40,648
You haven't
spoken to her?

279
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:43,284
She...Does not
care for me.

280
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:45,787
Ohh!

281
00:11:45,789 --> 00:11:47,488
Ahem.

282
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:51,893
But she would not
deny Merlyn's daughter.

283
00:11:51,895 --> 00:11:55,897
Ok. Fine. I will go
with you to talk to her.

284
00:11:55,899 --> 00:12:00,401
We--we will help you find your map,
and then that's it.

285
00:12:00,403 --> 00:12:04,138
I'm done,
for real this time.

286
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,943
It's a drug deal
gone bad.

287
00:12:08,945 --> 00:12:11,179
Very bad. Man was shot
over a dozen times.

288
00:12:11,181 --> 00:12:13,214
Maybe he pissed off
the competition.

289
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,517
I'll take it from here,
Lieutenant Drake.

290
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:18,519
Captain, this is
a drug-related homicide.

291
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:20,188
Isn't it a little below
your pay grade?

292
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,490
It's part of a larger,
uh, sting operation.

293
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,559
I wasn't aware
of a larger sting--

294
00:12:24,561 --> 00:12:26,494
You weren't aware because
it's above your pay grade, Lieutenant.

295
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:32,033
Oh. We will head back
to the station, then.

296
00:12:32,035 --> 00:12:36,337
Hey. You can leave
the evidence with me.

297
00:12:41,244 --> 00:12:42,910
Of course.

298
00:12:56,926 --> 00:13:00,528
Now I see why you didn't want
the boys to come.

299
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,931
That is Tigressa.

300
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,504
Looks like the only thing
she knows how to kill is vodka.

301
00:13:09,506 --> 00:13:11,539
She has over 200
confirmed kills,

302
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:15,576
one of them being her own brother
because he matched her quote.

303
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:25,419
Al ghul, I should
take your hand

304
00:13:25,421 --> 00:13:27,221
for what you did
to Al Sa-Her.

305
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:30,491
I never understood your affection
for Merlyn, Tigressa,

306
00:13:30,493 --> 00:13:33,528
but I always
respected it.

307
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:36,197
- This is his--
- Spawn.

308
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:38,699
You think I wouldn't
recognize Malcolm's own blood?

309
00:13:38,701 --> 00:13:41,002
Your father had
much faith in you.

310
00:13:41,004 --> 00:13:43,938
Yeah. Well, with that
new League he created running around,

311
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,606
I can't say
the same for him.

312
00:13:45,608 --> 00:13:49,010
So you've met
Athena.

313
00:13:49,012 --> 00:13:52,380
She's not the leader
your father desired. You are.

314
00:13:52,382 --> 00:13:55,383
Yeah. Well, I'm sure death
has cured him of his disappointment.

315
00:13:55,385 --> 00:13:59,020
Look. The only reason
why we're here is because Athena thinks

316
00:13:59,022 --> 00:14:02,323
I can open some map
for her.

317
00:14:02,325 --> 00:14:04,058
With good reason.

318
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,127
Your father made sure
you were the only one

319
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:08,763
that could actually
unlock its secrets.

320
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,231
Of course he did.

321
00:14:10,233 --> 00:14:15,570
And that is why
Athena needs you.

322
00:14:15,572 --> 00:14:23,344
Your father secreted
the map...Here.

323
00:14:24,614 --> 00:14:26,447
And why didn't you
just take it?

324
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:28,649
Heh. I rejected
the path

325
00:14:28,651 --> 00:14:30,685
of the League of Assassins

326
00:14:30,687 --> 00:14:32,620
a long time ago.

327
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:36,591
One day, you're gonna have to tell me
how you did that.

328
00:14:36,593 --> 00:14:38,659
- Thank you for this.
- Well, when you find it,

329
00:14:38,661 --> 00:14:40,528
you may not be
so grateful.

330
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,697
I was being polite.

331
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:45,900
We should contact
your brother.

332
00:14:45,902 --> 00:14:48,102
There's safety
in numbers.

333
00:14:49,272 --> 00:14:51,505
Overwatch, are you sure
we're alone here?

334
00:14:51,507 --> 00:14:52,974
Yes. It is just the five of you.

335
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,475
No other souls
for two blocks.

336
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:56,711
Copy.

337
00:15:01,017 --> 00:15:02,483
Be cautious.

338
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,819
Merlyn would have laid traps
to protect this place.

339
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,454
Yeah. What kind of traps
are we talking here?

340
00:15:06,456 --> 00:15:08,489
We talking "Raiders"
or "Temple of Doom" kind of traps?

341
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:10,791
- You ok?
- Yeah. I will be

342
00:15:10,793 --> 00:15:12,193
once this is all
over with.

343
00:15:12,195 --> 00:15:13,394
Yeah, me, too.

344
00:15:13,396 --> 00:15:15,329
Get down!

345
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,402
- A trap. Excellent.
- Excellent?

346
00:15:21,404 --> 00:15:23,237
We must be close.

347
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,308
Thermal imaging
is showing

348
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:28,743
that what we're looking at
is what we've got.

349
00:15:28,745 --> 00:15:30,311
No hallways, no doors.

350
00:15:30,313 --> 00:15:32,413
Malcolm had a secret chamber
in his office.

351
00:15:32,415 --> 00:15:34,982
Maybe he has something here.

352
00:15:34,984 --> 00:15:37,151
Clever.

353
00:15:44,894 --> 00:15:47,328
Iodine dixonium,
a component

354
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:49,230
magnetically attracted
to the same type of steel

355
00:15:49,232 --> 00:15:51,832
my father used
to encase relics.

356
00:16:09,419 --> 00:16:11,452
Ok. That's not
a map.

357
00:16:11,454 --> 00:16:13,521
The map is inside.

358
00:16:13,523 --> 00:16:14,989
It's an ancient League cipher.

359
00:16:14,991 --> 00:16:17,758
- Does it need a code?
- Try my birthday.

360
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,760
There are 18 digits
across 3 alphabets.

361
00:16:19,762 --> 00:16:21,462
Ok. So it's not
my birthday.

362
00:16:26,369 --> 00:16:29,503
Guys, about you being
the only souls for two blocks,

363
00:16:29,505 --> 00:16:31,172
funny thing
about those ninjas.

364
00:16:31,174 --> 00:16:33,474
I want
Al Sa-Her's daughter

365
00:16:33,476 --> 00:16:36,277
and the map.

366
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:39,113
I'm always merciful
when I get what I want.

367
00:16:39,115 --> 00:16:40,581
I know you better
than that.

368
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,950
Stand down.

369
00:16:42,952 --> 00:16:45,820
Not gonna ask twice.

370
00:16:51,694 --> 00:16:54,261
Come with us, and we
will let your friends continue

371
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,563
to draw breath.

372
00:16:55,565 --> 00:16:57,064
Stay where you are,

373
00:16:57,066 --> 00:16:59,166
and blood will be shed.

374
00:17:02,746 --> 00:17:04,488
I'll go with
shedding blood,

375
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,733
except
it will be yours.

376
00:17:06,735 --> 00:17:08,935
Get that
someplace safe. Go.

377
00:17:08,937 --> 00:17:11,304
Hey. The exit is kind of
blocked right now.

378
00:17:11,306 --> 00:17:13,473
We can help with that.

379
00:17:29,858 --> 00:17:33,259
You've had the same footwork
since you were 8 years old.

380
00:17:44,706 --> 00:17:46,906
Thea!

381
00:17:52,047 --> 00:17:55,782
Kevlar held...
Barely. Let's go.

382
00:18:09,764 --> 00:18:12,799
Make your father proud.

383
00:18:12,801 --> 00:18:14,434
Come with us.

384
00:18:14,436 --> 00:18:20,106
Felicity, I know you
were wondering.

385
00:18:20,108 --> 00:18:22,141
It's from "Raiders."

386
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:23,976
Kiss the floor.

387
00:18:29,284 --> 00:18:30,817
I've got
Thea and the map.

388
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:32,452
Let's move!

389
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:37,223
Unh!

390
00:18:40,428 --> 00:18:42,228
Hold on. Here.
Let me help you.

391
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:46,699
Ok. Ow. God, that bitch
has a really powerful kick.

392
00:18:46,701 --> 00:18:48,534
I think she might have
broken one of my ribs.

393
00:18:48,536 --> 00:18:50,103
I assure you that will be
the last time

394
00:18:50,105 --> 00:18:51,771
you have to face her.

395
00:18:51,773 --> 00:18:53,272
Yeah. You'll get
no complaints from me.

396
00:18:53,274 --> 00:18:54,941
This Athena doesn't
seem like a type

397
00:18:54,943 --> 00:18:56,542
who will give up easily.

398
00:18:56,544 --> 00:18:58,544
I intend to take
the choice out of her hands

399
00:18:58,546 --> 00:19:00,813
by taking Merlyn's map
far from here.

400
00:19:00,815 --> 00:19:03,316
I know the toll a father
can have on a child

401
00:19:03,318 --> 00:19:04,817
even long after he's gone.

402
00:19:04,819 --> 00:19:07,286
This is my burden,
not yours.

403
00:19:07,288 --> 00:19:08,821
You didn't tell me
that this was the box

404
00:19:08,823 --> 00:19:09,856
from "Hellraiser."

405
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,724
Take care of each other.

406
00:19:11,726 --> 00:19:13,092
Wow. That was a lot
easier than I thought it would be.

407
00:19:13,094 --> 00:19:14,427
Ok. Wait. No.

408
00:19:14,429 --> 00:19:16,295
How are you
gonna open it?

409
00:19:16,297 --> 00:19:17,764
I'll find someone who can
unlock the cipher.

410
00:19:17,766 --> 00:19:19,465
My people invented
mathematics after all.

411
00:19:19,467 --> 00:19:21,801
Yeah. No, no, no.
Not this type of mathematics.

412
00:19:21,803 --> 00:19:25,404
Wait. Look. You can't--
ugh--you can't go out there by yourself,

413
00:19:25,406 --> 00:19:27,240
not with Athena's assassins
looking for you.

414
00:19:27,242 --> 00:19:29,075
She said that's what she wanted
to do, Thea.

415
00:19:29,077 --> 00:19:30,576
Yeah. No.
It's not what I want.

416
00:19:30,578 --> 00:19:32,044
- Speedy?
- You made it clear

417
00:19:32,046 --> 00:19:33,813
once I acquired the map

418
00:19:33,815 --> 00:19:36,182
you'd have no interest
in your father or the League.

419
00:19:36,184 --> 00:19:38,451
And you made it clear
that this map, it leads

420
00:19:38,453 --> 00:19:41,587
to what, something
ancient and powerful.

421
00:19:41,589 --> 00:19:46,092
Ok. You cannot--
you cannot take this on by yourself.

422
00:19:46,094 --> 00:19:50,596
Plus we have the world's
greatest mathematician right there

423
00:19:50,598 --> 00:19:52,665
and the protection
that you are gonna need

424
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:55,034
to keep that thing safe
while you try to open it.

425
00:19:55,036 --> 00:19:57,203
I appreciate the gesture.

426
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,673
- Can you do it?
- Well, in my experience,

427
00:20:00,675 --> 00:20:03,109
anything locked
can be hacked.

428
00:20:03,111 --> 00:20:05,478
Usually by me.

429
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,781
Thea, are you
sure about this?

430
00:20:08,783 --> 00:20:11,050
Nyssa's right.
You did say that you want

431
00:20:11,052 --> 00:20:13,553
nothing to do
with Malcolm's legacy.

432
00:20:13,555 --> 00:20:15,354
I know, ok? Look.

433
00:20:15,356 --> 00:20:17,523
I can't believe that
I am even saying this,

434
00:20:17,525 --> 00:20:23,663
but...After seeing
those assassins, I--

435
00:20:23,665 --> 00:20:26,566
this all just became
too real.

436
00:20:26,568 --> 00:20:28,367
But Nyssa gave
you an out.

437
00:20:28,369 --> 00:20:30,036
I don't know why
you don't take it.

438
00:20:30,038 --> 00:20:32,338
I don't know how to
explain it to you right now, ok?

439
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:36,509
I just--I--I need
you to trust me.

440
00:20:37,912 --> 00:20:39,245
All right.
You ready?

441
00:20:39,247 --> 00:20:41,347
To go to prison
for stealing evidence?

442
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:43,049
No, not really.

443
00:20:43,051 --> 00:20:45,051
I'm doing the stealing.
You're doing the hacking.

444
00:20:45,053 --> 00:20:48,120
Look. Something tells me
the police don't make that distinction.

445
00:20:50,892 --> 00:20:55,161
This could be the last time I'm here
not as a suspect.

446
00:20:55,163 --> 00:20:57,964
How long is this
gonna take?

447
00:20:57,966 --> 00:21:02,235
My worry is 25 to life.

448
00:21:02,237 --> 00:21:04,136
Come on.

449
00:21:05,607 --> 00:21:07,039
Keep watch.

450
00:21:07,041 --> 00:21:08,608
I thought you said
no one else was gonna be here.

451
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:10,977
We're here,
aren't we?

452
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:18,985
Oh. This might
take a while.

453
00:21:20,889 --> 00:21:22,755
Crap.

454
00:21:22,757 --> 00:21:23,956
Come on.

455
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:25,958
This is
police access only.

456
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,961
What are you
doing here?

457
00:21:28,963 --> 00:21:32,098
Nick Anastas. Hey.

458
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,767
It has been a while.

459
00:21:34,769 --> 00:21:36,269
Do I know you?

460
00:21:36,271 --> 00:21:39,338
Yes. Of course.
Curtis Holt.

461
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,107
We met through Dinah Drake.

462
00:21:41,109 --> 00:21:42,875
She's my friend
and your sergeant

463
00:21:42,877 --> 00:21:44,944
or lieutenant,
or was it just Detective?

464
00:21:44,946 --> 00:21:47,980
Uh, either way,
I'm meeting her here for, uh, dinner,

465
00:21:47,982 --> 00:21:52,218
but I kind of got--heh--
lost in this new building.

466
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,453
I mean, I really haven't
seen this place

467
00:21:54,455 --> 00:21:57,089
since--since it was
blown up.

468
00:21:57,091 --> 00:21:58,991
Well, I could give you
a tour if you want

469
00:21:58,993 --> 00:22:00,960
while you're waiting
for Lieutenant Drake.

470
00:22:00,962 --> 00:22:03,195
She usually doesn't
show up for her shift for another hour.

471
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:05,665
Totally Dinah.

472
00:22:05,667 --> 00:22:07,333
She's, like,
a major slacker. Ha ha.

473
00:22:07,335 --> 00:22:10,002
- Come on.
- Yeah.

474
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,983
Gotcha.

475
00:22:26,587 --> 00:22:30,656
- Nyssa.
- Husband.

476
00:22:30,658 --> 00:22:33,392
Ha. You got to
stop doing that.

477
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:37,630
I--I do have
a wife now, and, um...

478
00:22:37,632 --> 00:22:39,565
She doesn't
like it.

479
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:42,835
But that's the fun of it.

480
00:22:42,837 --> 00:22:45,237
Thea might want you
to stay...

481
00:22:47,475 --> 00:22:49,141
Doesn't mean
you have to.

482
00:22:49,143 --> 00:22:51,177
Her point about
Felicity's utility was well taken.

483
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:53,012
So was her point about wanting nothing
to do with Malcolm.

484
00:22:53,014 --> 00:22:55,448
It is her life, and she must find
her own truth.

485
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:58,050
I think her truth is
a new life

486
00:22:58,052 --> 00:22:59,585
that she's earned.

487
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:01,187
She's earned your support
for her actions,

488
00:23:01,189 --> 00:23:03,089
whatever those
may be.

489
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:06,058
I can understand why
she would be conflicted with Malcolm.

490
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,259
He was her father.

491
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:08,594
I am not conflicted.

492
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:10,363
He was evil,

493
00:23:10,365 --> 00:23:13,065
and Thea should not
be charged with righting his wrongs.

494
00:23:13,067 --> 00:23:15,034
My father was
also evil,

495
00:23:15,036 --> 00:23:18,404
and I've dedicated the rest of my life
to righting his wrongs.

496
00:23:18,406 --> 00:23:21,173
From what I understand,
you've done the same.

497
00:23:21,175 --> 00:23:23,376
But my father
asked me to.

498
00:23:23,378 --> 00:23:25,811
With his dying wish,
he asked me to.

499
00:23:25,813 --> 00:23:28,414
Back on Lian Yu, Merlyn gave up
his life for Thea

500
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:30,850
just as your father
did for you.

501
00:23:30,852 --> 00:23:33,386
I believe Thea owes
him the same debt.

502
00:23:33,388 --> 00:23:36,722
Well, it is convenient
for you to believe that

503
00:23:36,724 --> 00:23:39,625
because Thea gets you
closer to what you want,

504
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:42,828
so do not pretend
that you are selflessly supporting her

505
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:46,399
and never, ever
lecture me

506
00:23:46,401 --> 00:23:48,100
on what I owe my sister.

507
00:23:48,102 --> 00:23:49,535
If you think
I would use--

508
00:23:49,537 --> 00:23:52,371
Nailed it!

509
00:23:52,373 --> 00:23:54,540
I nailed it!
I got it! Whoo!

510
00:23:54,542 --> 00:23:56,075
- You've unlocked the map?
- No.

511
00:23:56,077 --> 00:23:58,010
Ok. So what do you mean
by "nailed it"?

512
00:23:58,012 --> 00:24:00,012
Well, I figured out
how to unlock the "Hellraiser" cube.

513
00:24:00,014 --> 00:24:01,947
I just thought you
should do the honors.

514
00:24:01,949 --> 00:24:03,449
Oh.

515
00:24:03,451 --> 00:24:05,117
You've heard of
the Fibonacci sequence, right?

516
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:06,786
- Let's assume not.
- The Fibonacci sequence is

517
00:24:06,788 --> 00:24:08,454
a mathematical pattern
dating back

518
00:24:08,456 --> 00:24:10,756
to Pingala's formula
in 450 B.C.

519
00:24:10,758 --> 00:24:12,458
- Wow.
- Yeah.

520
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,026
When you said ancient,
you were not kidding.

521
00:24:14,028 --> 00:24:15,428
- I never kid.
- Except where my marriage

522
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:17,463
is concerned apparently.

523
00:24:17,465 --> 00:24:21,167
The Fibonacci sequence,
every number is the sum

524
00:24:21,169 --> 00:24:22,468
of the two previous numbers,

525
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:24,437
so finding the two
starting ones,

526
00:24:24,439 --> 00:24:25,738
that's the tricky part.

527
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,173
What are
the starting numbers?

528
00:24:27,175 --> 00:24:28,274
10 and 13.

529
00:24:28,276 --> 00:24:29,909
Is she right?

530
00:24:29,911 --> 00:24:31,444
1013 was the year that
the League was founded.

531
00:24:31,446 --> 00:24:33,179
And Malcolm's birthday.

532
00:24:33,181 --> 00:24:35,247
Ok. Sit.

533
00:24:36,918 --> 00:24:39,185
Try 10....13....

534
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:42,188
23...36...59.

535
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:44,190
95.

536
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:46,258
I was always good at math.

537
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,027
No. That's--
that's right.

538
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:57,002
Yeah.

539
00:25:04,011 --> 00:25:07,246
What does it say?

540
00:25:07,248 --> 00:25:09,715
- Nothing.
- Noth--

541
00:25:16,567 --> 00:25:18,600
Why are you
burning it?

542
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:20,502
She's heating it.

543
00:25:20,504 --> 00:25:22,070
The League writes
in hidden text

544
00:25:22,072 --> 00:25:24,272
that can only be revealed
through flame.

545
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:28,043
- You don't remember?
- I don't want to.

546
00:25:30,314 --> 00:25:32,948
I don't know what's
going on with him,

547
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:35,684
but just keep
working on it.

548
00:25:35,686 --> 00:25:37,352
Why isn't
the flame working?

549
00:25:37,354 --> 00:25:38,854
There's two
possibilities for that.

550
00:25:38,856 --> 00:25:40,355
Either Malcolm was using

551
00:25:40,357 --> 00:25:41,990
a different type
of invisible ink...

552
00:25:41,992 --> 00:25:43,358
Or?

553
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,726
Or there's nothing
on this,

554
00:25:44,728 --> 00:25:47,195
and we are
wasting our time.

555
00:25:47,197 --> 00:25:48,663
What's this?

556
00:25:48,665 --> 00:25:50,332
I thought since old school
wasn't working,

557
00:25:50,334 --> 00:25:52,000
I'd try some new school.

558
00:25:52,002 --> 00:25:55,003
This scanner can make
a 3-d voxel-based re-creation.

559
00:25:55,005 --> 00:25:58,039
I didn't start using
a computer until I was 25.

560
00:25:58,041 --> 00:26:00,041
Heh. That explains
a lot.

561
00:26:02,613 --> 00:26:05,013
If I can duplicate
the map digitally,

562
00:26:05,015 --> 00:26:07,816
there might be some hidden markers
on there that we can trace.

563
00:26:07,818 --> 00:26:12,087
- Sounds complicated.
- It is. Very.

564
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:17,626
So it would be
really great

565
00:26:17,628 --> 00:26:19,795
to not be distracted,
you know?

566
00:26:19,797 --> 00:26:22,564
Very true. I'll stay here
to make sure

567
00:26:22,566 --> 00:26:25,100
you remain uninterrupted...

568
00:26:25,102 --> 00:26:27,102
Sister wife.

569
00:26:27,104 --> 00:26:29,371
Ok.

570
00:26:34,011 --> 00:26:38,013
Ok. So somebody's grumpy.

571
00:26:38,015 --> 00:26:40,849
I'm sorry. I'm--I'm
trying to be supportive.

572
00:26:40,851 --> 00:26:42,551
But?

573
00:26:42,553 --> 00:26:44,419
But--but I don't
understand why you think

574
00:26:44,421 --> 00:26:45,987
that this is
your responsibility.

575
00:26:45,989 --> 00:26:49,858
He died for me, ok,

576
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,326
and I don't know
what it is,

577
00:26:51,328 --> 00:26:52,694
but ever since I found out
about this,

578
00:26:52,696 --> 00:26:55,664
I just--i f...

579
00:26:55,666 --> 00:26:58,233
I feel like I can't
run away from it yet.

580
00:26:58,235 --> 00:27:00,402
Well, you see, that's
where we're different.

581
00:27:00,404 --> 00:27:03,405
You see this as us
running away from something,

582
00:27:03,407 --> 00:27:06,107
but I see this as us running
towards something,

583
00:27:06,109 --> 00:27:07,642
something way better.

584
00:27:07,644 --> 00:27:10,245
You know, I just--
I don't know. I just feel like

585
00:27:10,247 --> 00:27:12,714
recently you've just been finding
any excuse you can

586
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:14,216
for us to stay here.

587
00:27:14,218 --> 00:27:16,618
Unlike all my boyfriends
in the past,

588
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:20,422
I--I do find it
kind of cute

589
00:27:20,424 --> 00:27:23,692
when you're being
insecure.

590
00:27:23,694 --> 00:27:26,094
I just don't want to
lose you again, Thea.

591
00:27:28,198 --> 00:27:32,634
That map is not
my future.

592
00:27:36,507 --> 00:27:38,340
You are.

593
00:27:46,283 --> 00:27:49,084
I love a good old
murder board.

594
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:54,262
Yeah. Feeling very
Alan J. Pakula.

595
00:27:54,738 --> 00:27:56,571
Sometimes, I forget
you're not Felicity.

596
00:27:56,573 --> 00:28:00,542
Now, look, I know this
has probably already occurred to you,

597
00:28:00,544 --> 00:28:03,444
but all Hill did was
take the evidence from your hands.

598
00:28:03,445 --> 00:28:05,345
That's not
necessarily proof.

599
00:28:05,346 --> 00:28:07,980
Not to mention her
name didn't pop up at all when--

600
00:28:07,982 --> 00:28:09,382
She's dirty.

601
00:28:09,384 --> 00:28:11,217
Are you asking me
or telling me?

602
00:28:11,219 --> 00:28:12,785
You tell me. If these
drugs are the same kind Diaz pushes...

603
00:28:12,787 --> 00:28:14,453
And Hill took it
off your hands,

604
00:28:14,455 --> 00:28:16,222
that would be
pretty damning.

605
00:28:16,224 --> 00:28:17,757
And the fact that so much
of the department

606
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:19,692
is so crooked would make
a lot more sense

607
00:28:19,694 --> 00:28:22,461
if it was rotten
from the top down.

608
00:28:22,463 --> 00:28:25,464
- So are they Diaz's drugs?
- I don't know yet.

609
00:28:25,466 --> 00:28:28,000
Maybe we should
just try it.

610
00:28:29,103 --> 00:28:31,504
Or we can read
the analysis.

611
00:28:35,210 --> 00:28:37,243
- Oh.
- What?

612
00:28:37,245 --> 00:28:39,745
It's Vertigo.

613
00:28:39,747 --> 00:28:41,581
I heard of this back
in Central City.

614
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:43,382
It's a hallucinogenic, right?

615
00:28:43,384 --> 00:28:45,218
Yeah, but, I mean,
the good thing is

616
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,086
that this isn't Diaz's
drug of choice.

617
00:28:47,088 --> 00:28:51,424
- So Hill is clean.
- Looks like.

618
00:28:51,426 --> 00:28:53,793
You actually look
disappointed.

619
00:28:53,795 --> 00:28:56,796
Well, just because
it means we are back to square one.

620
00:28:56,798 --> 00:28:58,164
Yeah.

621
00:29:00,902 --> 00:29:03,536
Think you might take
that thing with you?

622
00:29:03,538 --> 00:29:05,705
100% no.

623
00:29:08,142 --> 00:29:09,342
You ok?

624
00:29:09,344 --> 00:29:11,510
And why wouldn't I be?

625
00:29:11,512 --> 00:29:13,479
I mean, Roy only thinks
I'm gonna leave him,

626
00:29:13,481 --> 00:29:15,748
and a bunch of crazy
assassins my dead dad organized

627
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:19,318
are trying to kill me,
so my life is just...

628
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,087
Great.

629
00:29:21,089 --> 00:29:23,422
You know, Thea,
you don't have to do this.

630
00:29:23,424 --> 00:29:25,424
You don't have to leave
everything to Nyssa.

631
00:29:25,426 --> 00:29:27,693
Myself and John
and Felicity,

632
00:29:27,695 --> 00:29:30,596
we will stop Athena.

633
00:29:30,598 --> 00:29:33,532
You can go. You can--
you can live

634
00:29:33,534 --> 00:29:36,068
your happily ever after
with Roy.

635
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:39,438
Here I thought you
were supposed to go live yours.

636
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,176
Felicity--she told me you stopped
being the Green Arrow.

637
00:29:44,178 --> 00:29:46,479
Yeah. That was the plan.

638
00:29:47,715 --> 00:29:49,215
Life interfered.

639
00:29:49,217 --> 00:29:51,617
- John got hurt.
- He did.

640
00:29:51,619 --> 00:29:53,786
He's not hurt
anymore.

641
00:29:53,788 --> 00:29:56,989
I worry that he would be
in over his head

642
00:29:56,991 --> 00:29:59,525
going up
against Diaz alone.

643
00:29:59,527 --> 00:30:02,061
I don't think anything's
over John's head.

644
00:30:02,063 --> 00:30:04,597
You might be right.

645
00:30:04,599 --> 00:30:07,600
I don't know. I--I--

646
00:30:07,602 --> 00:30:09,135
I gave it up

647
00:30:09,137 --> 00:30:12,038
because I wanted to be
a better father,

648
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:18,811
but William accepts
the idea that I'm the Green Arrow,

649
00:30:18,813 --> 00:30:21,948
plus I don't want to
give it up.

650
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,616
I don't know why.

651
00:30:23,618 --> 00:30:25,518
I do.

652
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,586
Because being
the Green Arrow's

653
00:30:27,588 --> 00:30:29,689
what makes you
feel complete.

654
00:30:29,691 --> 00:30:32,892
- Hmm.
- For some reason, when you--

655
00:30:32,894 --> 00:30:36,195
you put that hood
on, it enables you to become

656
00:30:36,197 --> 00:30:38,397
the best version
of yourself.

657
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,433
We're supposed to be
talking about you.

658
00:30:40,435 --> 00:30:45,571
Maybe we are. Heh.
I don't know.

659
00:30:45,573 --> 00:30:47,606
Maybe that's the reason why
I can't seem

660
00:30:47,608 --> 00:30:49,976
to give
this life up.

661
00:30:49,978 --> 00:30:52,778
I...I don't know.

662
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,715
Maybe I'm hoping
that somehow

663
00:30:55,717 --> 00:30:58,684
I'll get
the same thing

664
00:30:58,686 --> 00:31:01,887
and find the best
version of myself,

665
00:31:01,889 --> 00:31:04,590
whoever she is.

666
00:31:04,592 --> 00:31:07,827
Athena's group
of assassins--found them.

667
00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:13,599
- Where are they?
- Star City gas plant.

668
00:31:13,601 --> 00:31:15,067
They can
cut off the city's entire supply.

669
00:31:15,069 --> 00:31:16,635
Or worse,
they could blow it up.

670
00:31:16,637 --> 00:31:18,037
Why? It's not
their M.O.

671
00:31:18,039 --> 00:31:19,438
It is if they're
using the plant

672
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,833
to leverage us
into giving up the map.

673
00:31:20,834 --> 00:31:22,768
Clearly, Athena
doesn't know you very well.

674
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:25,303
Yeah? Well, too bad.
It's not Ollie's choice. It's mine.

675
00:31:25,305 --> 00:31:27,005
You can't give
in to them.

676
00:31:27,007 --> 00:31:28,907
I can't let them hold
the city hostage, ok?

677
00:31:28,909 --> 00:31:30,809
This is still my home.

678
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,013
So what,
am I going alone?

679
00:31:41,822 --> 00:31:45,290
Overwatch, do you
have eyes on the Guild?

680
00:31:45,292 --> 00:31:46,725
No, not yet, but I'm reading
a frequency spike,

681
00:31:46,727 --> 00:31:48,527
which means they just
activated a bomb.

682
00:31:48,529 --> 00:31:50,695
Athena's way
of putting pressure on our negotiation.

683
00:31:50,697 --> 00:31:52,998
Let's fan out
and find the bomb.

684
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,866
Multiple heat signatures, guys.
They got you surrounded.

685
00:31:54,868 --> 00:31:56,234
Head on
a swivel.

686
00:31:56,681 --> 00:31:58,348
Well, where are
the new assassins?

687
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:00,516
Everywhere.

688
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:02,619
You want your map
so bad?

689
00:32:02,621 --> 00:32:04,520
Come out.

690
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:11,861
Let's talk.

691
00:32:11,863 --> 00:32:14,464
Perhaps your father
taught you some sense after all,

692
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:16,699
but you are mistaken
if you think that

693
00:32:16,701 --> 00:32:18,735
all we want is the map.

694
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:27,744
The map is meaningless
without spilling your blood.

695
00:32:32,104 --> 00:32:33,704
You're really starting
to piss me off.

696
00:32:47,238 --> 00:32:50,005
Your father spoke often
about you.

697
00:32:50,007 --> 00:32:52,341
He was always ashamed
of your weakness.

698
00:33:09,527 --> 00:33:12,328
Don't forget, guys.
We still have a bomb situation.

699
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:15,097
There's always
a bomb situation.

700
00:33:15,099 --> 00:33:16,699
I can trace the frequency root
of the detonator.

701
00:33:16,701 --> 00:33:20,002
It's 17 feet to your right.

702
00:33:20,004 --> 00:33:21,870
- Lead the way.
- Up.

703
00:33:29,447 --> 00:33:32,848
Merlyn said he tried
to teach you to be strong.

704
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:34,516
Clearly he failed.

705
00:33:34,518 --> 00:33:35,584
I'm not my father.

706
00:33:37,588 --> 00:33:38,988
This isn't working.

707
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,856
I know.
It's a collapsible circuit.

708
00:33:40,858 --> 00:33:42,224
I can freeze it.
I've done it before.

709
00:33:42,226 --> 00:33:43,659
No. No.
It's a Mercury switch.

710
00:33:43,661 --> 00:33:45,394
That will definitely
set it off.

711
00:33:45,396 --> 00:33:48,897
- What do I do?
- You can...Short-circuit it.

712
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:50,165
You know, I'm kind of
out of electricity arrows

713
00:33:50,167 --> 00:33:51,934
right now at the moment,
Felicity.

714
00:33:51,936 --> 00:33:53,035
Green Arrow.

715
00:33:55,606 --> 00:33:57,406
On its way!

716
00:33:59,710 --> 00:34:01,677
Got it.

717
00:34:04,882 --> 00:34:06,715
Whoo! Nice work.

718
00:34:08,619 --> 00:34:10,386
Thea!

719
00:34:23,868 --> 00:34:25,868
You have lost.

720
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:28,070
It's as clear
as your imminent death.

721
00:34:28,072 --> 00:34:29,905
You don't know what
you're talking about.

722
00:34:29,907 --> 00:34:34,276
I know that you bleed.
I win.

723
00:34:34,278 --> 00:34:36,312
You don't want to
do that.

724
00:34:38,549 --> 00:34:40,149
Unh!

725
00:34:46,657 --> 00:34:48,424
Are you all right?

726
00:34:48,426 --> 00:34:50,659
Learned a few tricks
from Merlyn.

727
00:34:53,597 --> 00:34:55,631
Wait. Where did
she go?

728
00:34:55,633 --> 00:34:58,701
That woman is hard
to kill.

729
00:34:58,703 --> 00:35:01,570
Were you really
going to burn it?

730
00:35:01,572 --> 00:35:03,405
To ashes.

731
00:35:03,407 --> 00:35:05,741
The other assassins either fled,
or they're wrapped up.

732
00:35:05,743 --> 00:35:07,409
I really didn't
miss those guys.

733
00:35:07,411 --> 00:35:08,677
Speedy, the map.

734
00:35:09,947 --> 00:35:11,280
They were being literal.

735
00:35:11,282 --> 00:35:13,282
They needed
your blood to spill.

736
00:35:13,284 --> 00:35:16,285
That's definitely not
"X" marks the spot.

737
00:35:16,287 --> 00:35:19,755
- Wait. Where does it lead?
- I believe I know where.

738
00:35:21,457 --> 00:35:23,991
Nanolithography.
The map's printed with bacteria.

739
00:35:23,992 --> 00:35:26,181
- Ugh. That's gross.
- And when exposed

740
00:35:26,182 --> 00:35:28,541
to the enzymes in Thea's DNA,
it will reveal itself.

741
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:30,575
- Ancient league secret?
- No, no, no.

742
00:35:30,576 --> 00:35:32,242
This is bleeding edge science.

743
00:35:32,244 --> 00:35:34,078
This requires
an atomic force microscope.

744
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,546
- Leave it to Merlyn.
- Nyssa, you said you know

745
00:35:35,548 --> 00:35:37,433
- what this map leads to.
- These are Ley lines.

746
00:35:37,434 --> 00:35:39,787
Oh, great. Ley lines. Yeah. We had
some experience with those with Damien Darhk.

747
00:35:39,788 --> 00:35:41,247
These are different.

748
00:35:41,248 --> 00:35:43,481
I thought they only
intersected in one place on earth.

749
00:35:43,483 --> 00:35:45,083
Doesn't look that way
from this.

750
00:35:45,085 --> 00:35:46,451
Indeed.
These lines are global

751
00:35:46,453 --> 00:35:47,986
and suggest
the existence

752
00:35:47,988 --> 00:35:49,721
of 3 intersections
of the kind I thought

753
00:35:49,723 --> 00:35:51,456
only existed
at Nanda Parbat.

754
00:35:51,458 --> 00:35:53,324
Right, but what only exists
on Nanda Parbat really?

755
00:35:53,326 --> 00:35:55,627
I mean, besides
really depressing decor.

756
00:35:55,629 --> 00:35:59,550
I know now why Merlyn
called his new league the Thanatos guild.

757
00:35:59,551 --> 00:36:02,072
Thanatos is the personification
of death in Greek mythology.

758
00:36:02,073 --> 00:36:04,106
Exactly.
I believe these lines

759
00:36:04,108 --> 00:36:06,475
suggest the existence
of 3 installments.

760
00:36:06,477 --> 00:36:08,744
- But 3 what?
- Your father discovered

761
00:36:08,746 --> 00:36:11,981
the existence
of 3 Lazarus pits.

762
00:36:11,983 --> 00:36:14,016
Of course he did.
I--enh.

763
00:36:14,018 --> 00:36:15,718
Thea, come on.

764
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,254
Hey, Roy.
Just let's give her some space.

765
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:28,597
Oh. Officer.

766
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:31,600
Nick, or should I just
call you officer

767
00:36:31,602 --> 00:36:33,169
because we're at work?

768
00:36:33,171 --> 00:36:34,637
Nick's fine.

769
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:36,739
You're becoming
a regular around here.

770
00:36:36,741 --> 00:36:38,040
Yeah. Well, you know,
I was just stopping by.

771
00:36:38,042 --> 00:36:39,408
To see Lieutenant Drake?

772
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:42,278
To ask you out
to dinner

773
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,080
or--or drinks
or, like, just coffee,

774
00:36:44,082 --> 00:36:46,015
or we could just, like,
walk down the street and talk.

775
00:36:46,017 --> 00:36:47,416
- I mean--
- Yes.

776
00:36:47,418 --> 00:36:49,652
-Yes?
-I get off of work tonight

777
00:36:49,654 --> 00:36:50,953
at 7:00.

778
00:36:50,955 --> 00:36:52,321
Yeah.

779
00:36:52,323 --> 00:36:53,956
So should we say
8:00?

780
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:57,993
8:00 is awesome. Heh.
8:00 is perfect. Heh.

781
00:36:57,995 --> 00:37:00,663
Yeah, I mean, I'll
make reservations, and I'll text you.

782
00:37:00,665 --> 00:37:03,799
Sounds like a plan.
See you tonight.

783
00:37:03,801 --> 00:37:05,234
Yeah.

784
00:37:10,475 --> 00:37:13,042
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

785
00:37:13,044 --> 00:37:15,811
Getting back
on the horse, D.,

786
00:37:15,813 --> 00:37:19,181
back in the game,
back in the saddle.

787
00:37:19,183 --> 00:37:21,016
I'm gonna get really
right into--

788
00:37:21,018 --> 00:37:22,685
What's wrong?

789
00:37:22,687 --> 00:37:24,286
I checked intake
and evidence lockup

790
00:37:24,288 --> 00:37:25,721
for any
Vertigo-related cases.

791
00:37:25,723 --> 00:37:28,224
- And?
- There aren't any.

792
00:37:28,226 --> 00:37:30,459
Is that not
a good thing?

793
00:37:30,461 --> 00:37:32,061
There aren't
any vertigo cases

794
00:37:32,063 --> 00:37:33,863
because they've
all been kicked

795
00:37:33,865 --> 00:37:35,531
and the evidence
released

796
00:37:35,533 --> 00:37:37,199
by Captain Hill.

797
00:37:37,201 --> 00:37:38,667
So she's dirty,

798
00:37:38,669 --> 00:37:40,336
and she did it
for Diaz.

799
00:37:40,338 --> 00:37:42,605
Ricardo Diaz is
pushing Vertigo.

800
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:51,080
Hey.

801
00:37:51,082 --> 00:37:54,850
Hey. Look.
I'm--I'm sorry

802
00:37:54,852 --> 00:37:57,319
for storming out
last night.

803
00:37:57,321 --> 00:38:00,055
It--I just
really needed some space,

804
00:38:00,057 --> 00:38:02,525
but it--it really had
nothing to do with you.

805
00:38:02,527 --> 00:38:04,960
It's fine. I'm just
trying to figure out

806
00:38:04,962 --> 00:38:08,197
if you packed that
bag to come with me or--or Nyssa.

807
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:10,065
I mean, it's pretty obvious
she wants to destroy

808
00:38:10,067 --> 00:38:13,202
the new Lazarus pits
just like she did with the original one.

809
00:38:13,204 --> 00:38:14,870
I mean, well,
can you blame her?

810
00:38:14,872 --> 00:38:16,505
I mean, what would happen
if the League

811
00:38:16,507 --> 00:38:20,209
or the Guild or just anyone
got their hands on it,

812
00:38:20,211 --> 00:38:21,877
how dangerous
that would be?

813
00:38:21,879 --> 00:38:25,347
So you--you are gonna
go with Nyssa?

814
00:38:25,349 --> 00:38:30,853
Look. Last night,
Ollie and I were talking,

815
00:38:30,855 --> 00:38:36,192
and we were talking
about how when, you know,

816
00:38:36,194 --> 00:38:40,062
he becomes
the Green Arrow, he--

817
00:38:40,064 --> 00:38:43,098
he feels complete,
and I was thinking

818
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:49,805
that maybe that's because when--
when he puts that hood on,

819
00:38:49,807 --> 00:38:52,841
he gets to right
our father's wrongs,

820
00:38:52,843 --> 00:38:55,744
and maybe this--
this could be my calling,

821
00:38:55,746 --> 00:39:00,082
this--this could be
what...I've been looking for.

822
00:39:00,084 --> 00:39:03,185
So you've made up
your mind?

823
00:39:03,187 --> 00:39:05,254
You know what?

824
00:39:06,958 --> 00:39:08,757
So have I.

825
00:39:14,732 --> 00:39:17,132
- I'm gonna go with you.
- What?

826
00:39:17,134 --> 00:39:19,702
No. No. You don't
need to do that.

827
00:39:19,704 --> 00:39:21,637
Yes, I do.

828
00:39:21,639 --> 00:39:24,106
I told you it doesn't
matter where we go

829
00:39:24,108 --> 00:39:25,641
as long as we go
together.

830
00:39:25,643 --> 00:39:28,811
God. How did I get
to be so lucky?

831
00:39:28,813 --> 00:39:31,113
Hmm. Let me think.
I think it has

832
00:39:31,115 --> 00:39:33,115
something to do
with a stolen purse.

833
00:39:33,117 --> 00:39:35,117
Heh.

834
00:39:38,229 --> 00:39:40,357
Just--just
be careful, all right?

835
00:39:40,365 --> 00:39:42,465
And if you need anything--

836
00:39:42,467 --> 00:39:45,067
and if you don't need anything,
just--just call me.

837
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:50,306
Keep her safe.

838
00:39:50,308 --> 00:39:52,141
You know I will.

839
00:39:52,143 --> 00:39:54,076
I missed you.

840
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:02,251
You drew her back
into this, Nyssa.

841
00:40:02,253 --> 00:40:04,653
That carries with it
a certain responsibility.

842
00:40:04,655 --> 00:40:07,923
Thea's your sister and the daughter
of Malcolm Merlyn.

843
00:40:07,925 --> 00:40:11,227
She has less need
of protection than you think.

844
00:40:15,366 --> 00:40:17,566
This is
a Horchis dagger.

845
00:40:17,568 --> 00:40:19,602
In the League of Assassins,
it symbolizes

846
00:40:19,604 --> 00:40:23,639
the cutting
of marital bonds.

847
00:40:23,641 --> 00:40:26,776
I hereby annul
our marriage.

848
00:40:26,778 --> 00:40:28,544
Heh heh.

849
00:40:28,546 --> 00:40:31,981
Nyssa, as--as
wedding gifts go,

850
00:40:31,983 --> 00:40:33,749
this, uh, isn't
half bad.

851
00:40:33,751 --> 00:40:35,818
Be well, Oliver.

852
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:45,561
Well...This is it.

853
00:40:45,563 --> 00:40:48,464
Thanks for clearing
a few things up for me.

854
00:40:48,466 --> 00:40:50,466
Of course.

855
00:40:50,468 --> 00:40:54,136
- One more piece of advice.
- Sure.

856
00:40:54,138 --> 00:40:56,839
If you're gonna
wear the hood,

857
00:40:56,841 --> 00:40:59,775
you shouldn't string
John along anymore.

858
00:40:59,777 --> 00:41:04,380
Thought I was the one
who gave the wise sibling advice.

859
00:41:04,382 --> 00:41:08,751
Nope. That has never
been the case.

860
00:41:10,288 --> 00:41:13,255
I am gonna miss you
so much.

861
00:41:13,257 --> 00:41:15,658
You'll be with me
the whole time.

862
00:41:36,013 --> 00:41:37,847
Good-bye, Speedy.

863
