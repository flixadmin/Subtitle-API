1
00:00:01,192 --> 00:00:03,302
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:03,608 --> 00:00:05,241
For 5 years, I was stranded

3
00:00:05,243 --> 00:00:08,878
on an island
with only one goal--

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,296
survive.

5
00:00:10,298 --> 00:00:12,115
Oliver Queen is alive.

6
00:00:12,117 --> 00:00:14,884
Now I will fulfill
my father's dying wish...

7
00:00:14,886 --> 00:00:16,619
Make it home.
Right my wrongs.

8
00:00:16,621 --> 00:00:17,637
No!

9
00:00:17,639 --> 00:00:19,455
To use the list of names
he left me

10
00:00:19,457 --> 00:00:23,626
and bring down those
who are poisoning my city.

11
00:00:23,628 --> 00:00:27,463
To do this, I must
become someone else.

12
00:00:27,465 --> 00:00:29,265
I must become...

13
00:00:29,267 --> 00:00:31,484
something else.

14
00:00:32,653 --> 00:00:32,653
As Kanye says,
get 'em high!

15
00:00:36,825 --> 00:00:38,825
- Get Down!

16
00:00:38,827 --> 00:00:40,827
Everybody keep down!

17
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:43,196
Nobody lifts their head,
nobody gets hurt.

18
00:00:43,198 --> 00:00:44,164
- Get down!
- Stay down!

19
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:45,481
Get on the floor
right now!

20
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:47,534
You can't jackhammer
into the safe.

21
00:00:47,536 --> 00:00:48,985
It's too thick.

22
00:00:50,037 --> 00:00:52,205
Shut up!

23
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,874
We're through!

24
00:00:54,876 --> 00:00:56,543
3 minutes.

25
00:00:56,545 --> 00:00:57,794
Make it 2!

26
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:08,221
Are you
trying to get us killed?

27
00:01:08,223 --> 00:01:09,973
Don't worry.

28
00:01:09,975 --> 00:01:11,941
I'm a cop.

29
00:01:14,011 --> 00:01:15,812
Please don't do anything.

30
00:01:15,814 --> 00:01:17,397
I don't want to die.

31
00:01:17,399 --> 00:01:18,948
Please!

32
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,624
What the hell's going on?

33
00:01:30,194 --> 00:01:33,029
He was a freakin' cop.

34
00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:35,799
Enough throwing shots.

35
00:01:38,253 --> 00:01:39,252
you hear that?

36
00:01:39,254 --> 00:01:43,139
Someone triggered the alarm!

37
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:44,207
Don't!

38
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:45,842
That's it. Let's go.

39
00:01:45,844 --> 00:01:48,178
Starling City
police department.

40
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:51,014
Lay down your weapons
and come out with your hands up.

41
00:01:51,016 --> 00:01:55,018
Repeat: Lay down your weapons and
come out with your hands up.

42
00:02:02,827 --> 00:02:04,110
Hold your fire.

43
00:02:07,715 --> 00:02:08,731
These are hostages.

44
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:10,366
Mills, contain the hostages.

45
00:02:10,368 --> 00:02:13,086
All units, move in!
Move in!

46
00:02:25,266 --> 00:02:27,250
Come here. You shot a cop.

47
00:02:27,252 --> 00:02:29,435
This is not how
we do things.

48
00:02:29,437 --> 00:02:31,754
Me getting killed isn't how
we do things, either, is it?

49
00:02:31,756 --> 00:02:33,273
- Is it?
- Get in the van!

50
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:49,372
Anchor the rear hand,
Diggle. Come on.

51
00:02:49,374 --> 00:02:51,624
Hey.

52
00:02:53,777 --> 00:02:54,744
Uhh! Uhh!

53
00:02:54,746 --> 00:02:56,462
Variable acceleration.

54
00:02:56,464 --> 00:02:58,464
Most fighters work
at the same pace.

55
00:02:58,466 --> 00:03:00,550
You switch it up, you throw
your opponent off his game.

56
00:03:00,552 --> 00:03:03,386
That was nice.
Where'd you learn that?

57
00:03:03,388 --> 00:03:05,121
His name's Yao Fei.

58
00:03:05,123 --> 00:03:07,473
He give you those scars?

59
00:03:07,475 --> 00:03:09,292
One of them.

60
00:03:09,294 --> 00:03:10,894
And the others?

61
00:03:10,896 --> 00:03:13,229
You know, one of these days
you're gonna be straight with me

62
00:03:13,231 --> 00:03:14,814
about what really
happened on that island.

63
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:17,300
Absolutely.

64
00:03:18,352 --> 00:03:19,435
Uhh!

65
00:03:19,437 --> 00:03:21,104
But not today.

66
00:03:21,106 --> 00:03:24,324
Still some pretty
sweet moves.

67
00:03:24,326 --> 00:03:26,826
Yep. Tonight I'm gonna
use them on him.

68
00:03:27,828 --> 00:03:30,864
Scott Morgan runs
water and power in the Glades.

69
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:32,999
Jacks up the prices
when people can't pay,

70
00:03:33,001 --> 00:03:35,668
shuts them down even
in the dead of winter.

71
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,337
Which is at least
a month away.

72
00:03:37,339 --> 00:03:38,454
Look at this.

73
00:03:38,456 --> 00:03:41,424
These guys started
at Keystone 3 years ago,

74
00:03:41,426 --> 00:03:43,993
then began moving west,
hitting banks along the way.

75
00:03:43,995 --> 00:03:46,829
This morning they hit
Starling City Trust.

76
00:03:46,831 --> 00:03:49,515
Shot an off-duty cop.
He's in a coma

77
00:03:49,517 --> 00:03:52,218
and the doctors are saying
it's a coin toss whether he'll make it.

78
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,187
If he's a cop, SCPD
will be all over it.

79
00:03:54,189 --> 00:03:56,839
Overwhelmed? Underfunded?

80
00:03:56,841 --> 00:03:58,942
Listen, these guys
don't hit one time.

81
00:03:58,944 --> 00:04:00,643
They hit 2 or 3 banks
per city,

82
00:04:00,645 --> 00:04:02,345
which means right now
they're planning their next job.

83
00:04:02,347 --> 00:04:03,696
I think you have
the wrong impression

84
00:04:03,698 --> 00:04:04,864
about what it is I do.

85
00:04:04,866 --> 00:04:06,699
You take out bad guys
with a bow and arrow.

86
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:08,618
I don't fight street crime.

87
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,620
That's a symptom
of what's wrong with this city.

88
00:04:10,622 --> 00:04:12,188
I'm trying to cure
the disease.

89
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,908
CEOs and crooked
entrepreneurs. I get it.

90
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,910
Listen, Oliver,
I'm just saying,

91
00:04:16,912 --> 00:04:19,379
maybe you can
make a difference

92
00:04:19,381 --> 00:04:21,664
if you think beyond
the scope of those pages.

93
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,383
I'm sure your father
wouldn't mind.

94
00:04:23,385 --> 00:04:24,717
No, you don't get it.

95
00:04:24,719 --> 00:04:26,552
My father died
so that I could live.

96
00:04:26,554 --> 00:04:28,421
Live and make a difference
by fixing the city

97
00:04:28,423 --> 00:04:30,673
that he and the people
in this book ruined.

98
00:04:30,675 --> 00:04:32,759
Every name
that I cross off this list

99
00:04:32,761 --> 00:04:34,043
honors that sacrifice.

100
00:04:34,045 --> 00:04:36,212
There's more than one way
to save this city.

101
00:04:36,214 --> 00:04:38,431
Not for me.

102
00:04:38,433 --> 00:04:40,667
Crime happens
in this city every day.

103
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:44,020
What do you want me
to do, stop all of it?

104
00:04:44,022 --> 00:04:48,391
It sounds like you have
a narrow definition of being a hero.

105
00:04:52,446 --> 00:04:54,614
I'm not a hero.

106
00:05:13,238 --> 00:05:15,589
Dad?

107
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:26,322
<font color=#00FF00>1x06</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Legacies</font>

108
00:05:26,323 --> 00:05:28,623
Original Air Date on November 14, 2012
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00FF00">elderman</font> ==

109
00:05:28,625 --> 00:05:30,346
Please tell me
that this is a nightmare

110
00:05:30,347 --> 00:05:31,935
and I'm about to wake up.

111
00:05:31,936 --> 00:05:33,772
How can Stagg Industries
pull out completely?

112
00:05:33,797 --> 00:05:35,039
They're our largest donor.

113
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,290
It's like they say--
"It's the economy, stupid."

114
00:05:37,292 --> 00:05:39,575
No, it's the stupid
economy.

115
00:05:39,577 --> 00:05:42,412
Ok, without Stagg, how long
can CNRI keep the doors open?

116
00:05:42,414 --> 00:05:44,664
It depends.
What time you got?

117
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,165
I have fiesta time.

118
00:05:46,167 --> 00:05:47,800
Or is it siesta time?

119
00:05:47,802 --> 00:05:50,053
Which one means a party
and which one means a nap?

120
00:05:50,055 --> 00:05:52,805
Tommy, as much
as I would love to relive

121
00:05:52,807 --> 00:05:55,675
intro to Spanish with you,
today is not a good day.

122
00:05:55,677 --> 00:05:58,177
Of course not. Working in this tiny
brick office is intolerable.

123
00:05:58,179 --> 00:06:00,386
Now, you know where is
a spectacular place

124
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:01,482
to spend the day?

125
00:06:01,483 --> 00:06:04,350
Coast City. Here's what
I am thinking.

126
00:06:04,352 --> 00:06:06,269
Sunset flight
on my private plane,

127
00:06:06,271 --> 00:06:08,905
dinner at Broome's,
I'll have you home by midnight.

128
00:06:08,907 --> 00:06:11,741
Or maybe in the morning.

129
00:06:11,743 --> 00:06:13,642
What is this?

130
00:06:13,644 --> 00:06:15,644
This is what
we talked about.

131
00:06:15,646 --> 00:06:17,813
This is you getting to know
the real me.

132
00:06:17,815 --> 00:06:19,198
Tommy, so you don't
misunderstand,

133
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,650
CNRI just lost
its largest single donor.

134
00:06:21,652 --> 00:06:24,170
Which means all of the hard work
and sacrifices

135
00:06:24,172 --> 00:06:26,089
that I have made to help
this legal clinic survive,

136
00:06:26,091 --> 00:06:28,374
it may have been for nothing.

137
00:06:29,927 --> 00:06:32,879
Maybe another time.

138
00:06:32,881 --> 00:06:34,680
Yeah?

139
00:06:37,501 --> 00:06:42,105
I mean, haven't you noticed
she's been acting a little down lately?

140
00:06:42,107 --> 00:06:44,557
What am I saying?
Of course you haven't.

141
00:06:44,559 --> 00:06:46,059
Well, who are you
to judge?

142
00:06:46,061 --> 00:06:48,177
Since when do you
pay attention to how mom's feeling?

143
00:06:48,179 --> 00:06:50,613
Since our stepfather suddenly
decided to take a business trip

144
00:06:50,615 --> 00:06:52,148
halfway across the world.

145
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,484
I think when someone at Walter's
pay grade takes a business trip,

146
00:06:54,486 --> 00:06:56,202
it's always sudden, Thea.
I wouldn't worry.

147
00:06:56,204 --> 00:06:58,871
Ah, guess who I just
hung up with.

148
00:06:58,873 --> 00:07:01,023
Janice Bowen.

149
00:07:01,025 --> 00:07:02,358
Carter's mother.

150
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,326
Oh.

151
00:07:03,328 --> 00:07:05,328
Carter Bowen.

152
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:07,363
The perfect son.

153
00:07:07,365 --> 00:07:08,531
Is he perfect?

154
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:09,749
According to you.

155
00:07:09,751 --> 00:07:12,552
Carter Bowen just won
the national chess championship.

156
00:07:12,554 --> 00:07:15,204
Carter Bowen is anchoring
the debate team.

157
00:07:15,206 --> 00:07:16,722
I'm sure I didn't
make that big of a fuss.

158
00:07:16,724 --> 00:07:18,057
Oliver, Carter
just got accepted

159
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:20,226
into Harvard and Princeton.

160
00:07:20,228 --> 00:07:22,545
Well, that's because Carter
got a perfect score on his SATs.

161
00:07:22,547 --> 00:07:25,598
Now, how did he manage
to study and cure cancer?

162
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,567
All right, all right,
all right. I get it. I get it.

163
00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:30,436
Well, they're coming for brunch
and I expect you to be there.

164
00:07:30,438 --> 00:07:31,821
I have plans.

165
00:07:31,823 --> 00:07:33,523
That's fine.
Brunch is tomorrow.

166
00:07:33,525 --> 00:07:36,058
Hmm. Inches from
a clean getaway.

167
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,393
Well, you, too, Thea.

168
00:07:37,395 --> 00:07:38,394
Snap.

169
00:07:38,396 --> 00:07:39,862
Nobody says that anymore.

170
00:07:39,864 --> 00:07:41,781
What? Mom.

171
00:07:41,783 --> 00:07:42,832
Hmm?

172
00:07:42,834 --> 00:07:44,250
I can't actually go.

173
00:07:44,252 --> 00:07:47,253
I haven't seen
the Bowens in years.

174
00:07:47,255 --> 00:07:49,288
So whatever it is
that you have planned,

175
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:53,860
I'm sure the two of you can make
the sacrifice just this once.

176
00:07:53,862 --> 00:07:55,678
We'll be there.

177
00:08:01,969 --> 00:08:04,604
I hate you.

178
00:08:09,394 --> 00:08:10,860
Yeah.

179
00:08:10,862 --> 00:08:12,778
You know your friend
Scott Morgan from your father's list?

180
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,230
He tried to kill himself.

181
00:08:14,232 --> 00:08:16,765
Maybe he was afraid
of getting a visit from you.

182
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:18,284
How fast can you make it
to Starling General?

183
00:08:18,286 --> 00:08:20,369
On my way.

184
00:08:20,371 --> 00:08:23,072
Hey, just the man
I wanted to see.

185
00:08:23,074 --> 00:08:24,407
I just picked up
a new sports car,

186
00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:25,908
and I'm thinking
we can open her up,

187
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,793
pick up a few
speeding tickets--

188
00:08:27,795 --> 00:08:30,913
that sounds great, but something's
come up. I gotta jet.

189
00:08:30,915 --> 00:08:32,498
Oh. Uh, okay.

190
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,950
Nice talk. Thanks.

191
00:08:36,837 --> 00:08:39,005
He moves fast, doesn't he?

192
00:08:39,007 --> 00:08:40,122
It's ironic, really,

193
00:08:40,124 --> 00:08:41,891
since you're the one
we call speedy.

194
00:08:41,893 --> 00:08:45,978
Oh, please.
For the love of God.

195
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,899
But if you need somebody to talk to,
I'm here.

196
00:08:49,901 --> 00:08:53,803
You know,
maybe you could help.

197
00:08:53,805 --> 00:08:57,273
There's this girl
that I'm interested in.

198
00:08:57,275 --> 00:09:01,744
And I am really not sure
how to pursue it.

199
00:09:01,746 --> 00:09:04,363
Have you tried using
your usual lines?

200
00:09:04,365 --> 00:09:07,200
Hi, my name is Tommy Merlyn
and I'm a billionaire,

201
00:09:07,202 --> 00:09:08,801
but I don't look like
Warren Buffet.

202
00:09:08,803 --> 00:09:10,870
Yeah. She is aware
of that,

203
00:09:10,872 --> 00:09:12,371
and she doesn't care.

204
00:09:12,373 --> 00:09:14,123
You know, money really
isn't a big deal to her.

205
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:17,426
Why don't you just
tell her how you feel?

206
00:09:17,428 --> 00:09:19,045
Well, I've--I--

207
00:09:19,047 --> 00:09:21,430
I've known her
for a long time,

208
00:09:21,432 --> 00:09:24,333
and I'm not sure the direct approach
is really the right way to go.

209
00:09:24,335 --> 00:09:26,052
Maybe you just
have to figure out

210
00:09:26,054 --> 00:09:30,890
what's a big deal to her
and make it a big deal to you.

211
00:09:30,892 --> 00:09:33,109
Thea.

212
00:09:33,111 --> 00:09:35,611
You are amazing.

213
00:09:35,613 --> 00:09:37,697
Love you.

214
00:09:46,856 --> 00:09:48,457
You sure?

215
00:09:48,459 --> 00:09:50,543
Scott Morgan doesn't
seem like the type

216
00:09:50,545 --> 00:09:52,211
who would try
to kill himself.

217
00:09:52,213 --> 00:09:56,549
True, but it's the best lie
I could come up with on short notice.

218
00:09:56,551 --> 00:10:00,303
Mr. Diggle,
I can't thank you enough

219
00:10:00,305 --> 00:10:01,524
for arranging to move my husband

220
00:10:01,549 --> 00:10:03,687
from County Ward
to Starling General.

221
00:10:03,787 --> 00:10:06,289
Now I know he's getting
the best care available.

222
00:10:06,344 --> 00:10:07,727
You really should be
thanking this man,

223
00:10:07,729 --> 00:10:09,428
Oliver Queen.
He's paying the bill.

224
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,814
Jana's husband Stan
is a police officer,

225
00:10:11,816 --> 00:10:13,613
who happened to have
been making a deposit

226
00:10:13,638 --> 00:10:15,235
at Starling Trust Bank.

227
00:10:15,236 --> 00:10:16,986
The bank that was robbed.

228
00:10:16,988 --> 00:10:19,591
I was so sorry
to hear about your husband.

229
00:10:19,616 --> 00:10:21,158
Is he gonna be okay?

230
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:23,159
The doctors say
the next 24 hours are crucial.

231
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:26,061
He should have just
kept his head down, you know?

232
00:10:26,063 --> 00:10:28,030
I've known a few police
officers in my day.

233
00:10:28,032 --> 00:10:29,398
Always willing
to help others

234
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,784
even if that means
putting themselves at risk.

235
00:10:34,121 --> 00:10:35,571
Thank you.

236
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,074
You're welcome.

237
00:10:44,464 --> 00:10:45,748
You lied to me.

238
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,100
You asked me to work
with you, not for you.

239
00:10:48,102 --> 00:10:50,002
And when you did,
you said it was because

240
00:10:50,004 --> 00:10:51,804
you understand
the kind of man I am.

241
00:10:51,806 --> 00:10:53,639
Well, Oliver, I'm the kind of man
who doesn't walk away

242
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:55,424
when there's a chance
to make a difference.

243
00:10:55,426 --> 00:10:57,259
And neither does
Stan Washington.

244
00:10:57,261 --> 00:10:59,928
Oliver, I'm not finished talking.
Where are you going?

245
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,314
To go make a difference.

246
00:11:01,316 --> 00:11:03,649
Let's catch
some bank robbers.

247
00:11:11,336 --> 00:11:12,953
See that guy right there?
He's got a temper.

248
00:11:12,955 --> 00:11:14,538
And he shot
Officer Washington.

249
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,705
That's right.

250
00:11:17,957 --> 00:11:19,675
College ring.

251
00:11:19,677 --> 00:11:21,394
Or high school,
more likely.

252
00:11:21,396 --> 00:11:22,812
That ring will get us
an I.D.

253
00:11:22,814 --> 00:11:25,431
Yeah, but even with
photo enhancement,

254
00:11:25,433 --> 00:11:27,933
you're gonna have a problem
getting a clear shot of that ring.

255
00:11:27,935 --> 00:11:30,186
No, but it left an impression the police
would have photographed.

256
00:11:30,188 --> 00:11:32,104
It'll be in evidence
lockup.

257
00:11:34,908 --> 00:11:37,426
Please tell me you're not going
where I think you're going.

258
00:11:37,428 --> 00:11:40,129
Diggle,
why do you even ask?

259
00:11:50,173 --> 00:11:52,658
Are you kidding me?
I don't want to hear this.

260
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,677
Don't tell me about
red tape.

261
00:11:54,679 --> 00:11:56,462
One of our own's been shot.

262
00:11:56,464 --> 00:11:59,632
Tell them to find themselves
a pair of scissors.

263
00:12:22,823 --> 00:12:26,041
So, where are you
gonna take me today?

264
00:12:26,043 --> 00:12:28,077
Monte Carlo?

265
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,863
Actually, I was just
telling Jo here

266
00:12:30,865 --> 00:12:32,832
that the Merlyn Global Group

267
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:34,500
is looking to expand
its local philanthropy,

268
00:12:34,502 --> 00:12:36,702
and I thought
that we could start

269
00:12:36,704 --> 00:12:39,305
by sponsoring a benefit
for CNRI.

270
00:12:39,307 --> 00:12:41,640
Thank you, Tommy,
but I think we can manage

271
00:12:41,642 --> 00:12:43,576
without your family's
finances.

272
00:12:44,478 --> 00:12:47,062
Laurel, a word?

273
00:12:47,064 --> 00:12:49,682
Come on.

274
00:12:49,684 --> 00:12:51,550
What are you doing?

275
00:12:51,552 --> 00:12:54,437
He's not interested
in throwing us a fundraiser.

276
00:12:54,439 --> 00:12:56,939
What he wants to have
is the first annual attempt

277
00:12:56,941 --> 00:12:58,607
to get back
into my pants gala.

278
00:12:58,609 --> 00:13:00,576
Who cares why he's doing it?
We need the money.

279
00:13:02,996 --> 00:13:04,780
Not like that we don't.

280
00:13:04,782 --> 00:13:08,200
We really do. So you're gonna
listen to your best friend's advice.

281
00:13:08,202 --> 00:13:12,838
You are gonna go over there
and say, "Thank you, Tommy,

282
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,958
we'd be honored if you'd
throw us a fundraiser." Hmm?

283
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,716
Thank you, Tommy.
We would be honored

284
00:13:23,718 --> 00:13:26,218
for you to throw us
a fundraiser.

285
00:13:29,923 --> 00:13:32,424
The bank manager
Ace punched,

286
00:13:32,426 --> 00:13:34,477
his ring left a mark.

287
00:13:36,546 --> 00:13:39,231
Larchmont High.

288
00:13:39,233 --> 00:13:40,783
High school.

289
00:13:40,785 --> 00:13:42,601
I cross-referenced
his height and relative age

290
00:13:42,603 --> 00:13:44,286
with a list of students
and alumni.

291
00:13:44,288 --> 00:13:45,955
Still, that's
a pretty long list.

292
00:13:45,957 --> 00:13:49,325
It was. I dug a little deeper
and found Kyle Reston.

293
00:13:49,327 --> 00:13:50,793
Right before Kyle's
senior year,

294
00:13:50,795 --> 00:13:53,111
not only did he drop out,
he dropped off the grid.

295
00:13:53,113 --> 00:13:54,914
Along with his family--

296
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:59,418
father, mother,
younger brother.

297
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,620
There are two other guys
involved in this robbery.

298
00:14:01,622 --> 00:14:02,805
And a woman.

299
00:14:02,807 --> 00:14:04,523
Aside from Stan Washington,

300
00:14:04,525 --> 00:14:06,141
there were 22 customers
and employees

301
00:14:06,143 --> 00:14:07,309
that came out of the bank.

302
00:14:07,311 --> 00:14:08,644
9 men, 13 women.

303
00:14:08,646 --> 00:14:10,128
Inside the bank,

304
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,314
9 men, 14 women.

305
00:14:12,316 --> 00:14:14,517
They put a ringer in.

306
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:17,019
The mom. The police
are looking for a crew,

307
00:14:17,021 --> 00:14:19,104
we're gonna look for a family.
Speaking of which,

308
00:14:19,106 --> 00:14:20,639
I'm incredibly late
for mine.

309
00:14:20,641 --> 00:14:23,742
Well, I'm sorry Walter
couldn't join us.

310
00:14:23,744 --> 00:14:27,145
Oh, yes, well, the Australian trip
came up suddenly.

311
00:14:27,147 --> 00:14:28,647
He sends his apologies.

312
00:14:28,649 --> 00:14:31,166
Where's Oliver?
He's not out of town, too, is he?

313
00:14:31,168 --> 00:14:32,368
Oh, I'm sure he's just--

314
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:33,652
Stuck in traffic.

315
00:14:33,654 --> 00:14:35,955
One of the things
I didn't miss on the island--

316
00:14:35,957 --> 00:14:39,341
Sunday drivers.
Sorry I'm late.

317
00:14:39,343 --> 00:14:41,460
Thank God you're here.

318
00:14:41,462 --> 00:14:42,628
It is so good to see you.

319
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,431
Mm. We all thought
you were--

320
00:14:45,433 --> 00:14:47,666
oh, well, we are
just happy he's home.

321
00:14:47,668 --> 00:14:49,835
Hmm. And returning
a celebrity, too.

322
00:14:49,837 --> 00:14:51,169
How do you mean?

323
00:14:51,171 --> 00:14:54,523
Billionaire scion,
castaway for 5 years.

324
00:14:54,525 --> 00:14:56,225
You know,
there is a bidding war

325
00:14:56,227 --> 00:14:59,111
for the rights
to your life story.

326
00:14:59,113 --> 00:15:00,312
At least that's what
my agent says.

327
00:15:00,314 --> 00:15:02,815
Agent? I thought you were
a neurosurgeon, Carter.

328
00:15:02,817 --> 00:15:04,567
I know.
It's crazy, right?

329
00:15:04,569 --> 00:15:05,868
One minute I'm
publishing this book

330
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,037
on how long-term
potentiation

331
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:11,373
initiates the creation
of a slow-moving

332
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:12,458
protein synthesis,

333
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,876
and the next,
there's an agent

334
00:15:13,878 --> 00:15:15,244
trying to make me
the next Dr. Oz.

335
00:15:15,246 --> 00:15:17,546
Why would he want
you to be a wizard?

336
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:19,548
Oh, Oliver.

337
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:21,584
For all our sakes,
start ready "Us Weekly."

338
00:15:21,586 --> 00:15:24,587
Well, the truth is,
I just feel it's our duty

339
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:27,640
as Starling City's more fortunate
to help those most in need.

340
00:15:27,642 --> 00:15:28,807
Oh, of course.

341
00:15:28,809 --> 00:15:29,875
Wouldn't you agree,
Oliver?

342
00:15:29,877 --> 00:15:32,728
You're the hero, Carter.

343
00:15:34,547 --> 00:15:39,217
Quick and clean,
and try not to shoot anybody.

344
00:15:42,939 --> 00:15:45,157
So now that you're back,
what are your plans?

345
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:47,826
Will you be taking a job
with Queen Consolidated?

346
00:15:47,828 --> 00:15:49,227
I'm opening a night club.

347
00:15:50,948 --> 00:15:52,281
Sir, your liquor
distributor's on the line.

348
00:15:52,283 --> 00:15:56,035
First Bank of Starling
was hit two minutes ago.

349
00:15:56,037 --> 00:16:00,039
Sorry. Business.

350
00:16:01,908 --> 00:16:04,843
If the rest of their M.O. holds,
they made their escape underground.

351
00:16:04,845 --> 00:16:07,796
First Bank of Starling is located
right above the water treatment tunnels.

352
00:16:07,798 --> 00:16:09,414
The entrance is located here.

353
00:16:09,416 --> 00:16:11,433
Oliver.

354
00:16:11,435 --> 00:16:12,801
Where are you going?

355
00:16:12,803 --> 00:16:14,103
Something's come up.

356
00:16:14,105 --> 00:16:16,588
I'm really sorry.

357
00:16:38,578 --> 00:16:41,213
SCPD! Don't move!

358
00:16:44,117 --> 00:16:45,951
Enough! What are you doing?!

359
00:17:05,105 --> 00:17:07,305
Let's get out of here!

360
00:17:10,443 --> 00:17:12,978
- The cash!
- Forget it!

361
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,830
Let's go!

362
00:17:15,815 --> 00:17:17,449
All right, let's move!

363
00:17:19,502 --> 00:17:21,503
It's vigilante.

364
00:17:42,192 --> 00:17:43,979
Who the hell was that guy?

365
00:17:43,981 --> 00:17:45,163
The local vigilante.

366
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:46,548
Usually goes after
rich guys.

367
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,916
Well, clearly
he's branching out.

368
00:17:47,918 --> 00:17:49,117
Things have gone sideways
for us lately.

369
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:51,803
That hood guy showing up,
Kyle shooting a cop.

370
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:53,004
You were the one
who warned me he was a cop.

371
00:17:53,006 --> 00:17:54,389
So you would take his gun,
not shoot him.

372
00:17:54,391 --> 00:17:55,724
Your mother has a point.

373
00:17:55,726 --> 00:17:58,009
Maybe this is a sign
we need to hang it up.

374
00:17:58,011 --> 00:17:59,060
Head for Mexico, retire.

375
00:17:59,062 --> 00:18:00,762
We don't have enough.

376
00:18:00,764 --> 00:18:02,380
We always said
that we wouldn't quit

377
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:04,516
until we had enough
to set ourselves up.

378
00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:06,217
The kid's right.
We need to hit another.

379
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:08,069
- We can make do with what we've got.
- We'll be okay.

380
00:18:08,071 --> 00:18:11,573
I didn't spend 5 years
risking my life and my freedom

381
00:18:11,575 --> 00:18:12,941
to just be okay.

382
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:15,843
No. Set for life.

383
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:18,313
That was our deal.

384
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:22,066
Ok.

385
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:24,902
One more.

386
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:27,188
And then we're out.

387
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:34,162
I should add "personal Internet
researcher for Oliver Queen"

388
00:18:34,164 --> 00:18:36,831
to my job title.

389
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:40,051
Happily, I mean.

390
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:42,270
His name is Derek Reston.

391
00:18:42,272 --> 00:18:44,672
We were close before
I... went away.

392
00:18:44,674 --> 00:18:46,991
And I want to
get back in touch.

393
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:48,710
I guess you didn't have
Facebook on that island.

394
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:50,818
Nope. Not even
a MySpace account.

395
00:18:50,843 --> 00:18:52,843
It was a very dark time.

396
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:55,383
Well, there's not much here
that's recent.

397
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:57,385
No credit activity.

398
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:59,687
No utility bills.

399
00:18:59,689 --> 00:19:02,023
Well, I guess you guys
must have met at the factory.

400
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:05,693
Wait.
What--what factory?

401
00:19:05,695 --> 00:19:08,613
The Queen Steel Factory.

402
00:19:08,615 --> 00:19:10,698
Derek Reston worked there
for 15 years

403
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,850
until it shut down in '07.

404
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:17,488
Derek Reston
worked for my father?

405
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,140
You weren't really
close friends, huh?

406
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:24,028
It looks like Derek
was the factory Foreman

407
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:26,631
until your dad outsourced
production to China.

408
00:19:26,633 --> 00:19:29,550
About 1,500 employees
got laid off.

409
00:19:29,552 --> 00:19:31,296
Looks like the finance guys
even found a loophole

410
00:19:31,321 --> 00:19:34,032
in the union contract,
so, they didn't have to pay

411
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:36,331
severance packages
and pensions to their employees.

412
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:40,011
They all pretty much
lost their homes.

413
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,946
Including your friend.

414
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:47,885
You died.

415
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:52,723
I asked you,
I begged you to survive.

416
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:55,059
But I don't think you can.

417
00:19:57,162 --> 00:19:59,747
There's still one bullet left.

418
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,703
But, Oliver,

419
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:10,208
my death is made
meaningless by yours.

420
00:20:16,515 --> 00:20:18,683
I'm starving.

421
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:19,934
I'm gonna die anyway,

422
00:20:19,936 --> 00:20:22,103
and I just want it
to be quick.

423
00:20:22,105 --> 00:20:24,422
I want it to be quick,
like yours was.

424
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:27,275
You can survive this.

425
00:20:27,277 --> 00:20:30,594
No, I can't.

426
00:20:30,596 --> 00:20:35,450
I'm not as strong
as you think I am.

427
00:20:35,452 --> 00:20:37,902
And I'm sorry.

428
00:20:39,372 --> 00:20:41,539
The Restons just got home
after 5 years of being away.

429
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,908
Those factory guys hung out
at a bar after work.

430
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,543
I'm going down there.
Hopefully Derek Reston

431
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:47,411
wants to take a stroll
down memory lane.

432
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,630
And if by some miracle
Reston's there?

433
00:20:49,632 --> 00:20:51,582
I'm gonna give him
the chance to do the right thing.

434
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:54,085
Oliver, he already had his chance
to do the right thing.

435
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:55,887
It's called
not being a criminal.

436
00:20:55,889 --> 00:20:58,806
This is happening
because of my father.

437
00:20:58,808 --> 00:21:00,725
Because of my family.

438
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:02,477
No. You're worried
about the wrong thing.

439
00:21:02,479 --> 00:21:05,763
It's not your fault.
The Restons aren't the victims.

440
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:07,798
My family
stole from this city.

441
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,517
They hurt the people in it.

442
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:12,336
And I am hell-bent
on making that right.

443
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,990
For Derek Reston, that
means giving him the chance

444
00:21:15,992 --> 00:21:18,025
to make it right.

445
00:21:20,996 --> 00:21:22,914
Hey, don't fade on me now.

446
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:25,833
We have about 10,000
more decisions to make.

447
00:21:25,835 --> 00:21:29,170
Now, cake--
chocolate or mocha?

448
00:21:29,172 --> 00:21:31,655
Mm... Carrot.

449
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:34,208
Are you sure about that?
Because Bugs Bunny hasn't RSVP'd yet.

450
00:21:35,844 --> 00:21:40,664
Tell me,
why the full-court press?

451
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,467
Asking me to coast city,
the fundraiser--

452
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,386
why now?

453
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,110
You know, I was in a bar
last week,

454
00:21:53,112 --> 00:21:55,679
and I was talking
to this girl,

455
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,782
and things were progressing,
if you know what I mean.

456
00:21:57,784 --> 00:22:00,368
No. You're too subtle.

457
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:04,705
Anyway, we finally
go back to her place,

458
00:22:04,707 --> 00:22:07,024
and I realize all of a sudden--

459
00:22:08,228 --> 00:22:09,810
That I'd been there before.

460
00:22:09,812 --> 00:22:13,047
Been with her before.

461
00:22:13,049 --> 00:22:14,732
Two years ago.

462
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:17,335
Just... didn't remember.

463
00:22:17,337 --> 00:22:20,104
So I left.

464
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:28,679
You know, I remember
some of the mornings

465
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:31,332
when you and I
were together

466
00:22:31,334 --> 00:22:34,852
and I made you omelets.

467
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:39,607
And I'd be in your kitchen
and I would think to myself,

468
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:41,742
this isn't just fun.

469
00:22:41,744 --> 00:22:45,029
This is more than fun.
This is...

470
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:48,082
this is different.

471
00:22:49,418 --> 00:22:53,754
I never felt that way
with anybody else.

472
00:22:53,756 --> 00:22:55,256
And I miss it.

473
00:23:01,746 --> 00:23:04,265
Not mocha. Carrot.

474
00:23:04,267 --> 00:23:06,050
Carrot.

475
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,022
♪ ...my imagination

476
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:15,860
Ok, fellas.

477
00:23:15,862 --> 00:23:17,261
Thanks for playing.

478
00:23:17,263 --> 00:23:22,617
Ahem. Mind if I sit in?

479
00:23:22,619 --> 00:23:24,785
Oliver Queen.

480

The prodigal son returns.

481
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:29,041
I didn't figure you
for someone who would

482
00:23:29,066 --> 00:23:30,959
hang out in the Glades.

483
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,327
My father used to bring me here
after we visited the factory.

484
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,212
There was a Pac-man machine
in the back.

485
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:37,632
I had the high score
for two months.

486
00:23:37,634 --> 00:23:40,117
The last time
I saw your dad,

487
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:41,769
he was making a speech,

488
00:23:41,771 --> 00:23:44,472
telling my crew not to believe
all the gossip,

489
00:23:44,474 --> 00:23:47,842
that there was no way
Queen Consolidated

490
00:23:47,844 --> 00:23:49,626
was moving production
to China.

491
00:23:49,628 --> 00:23:51,795
A week later,
they closed the doors.

492
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:54,965
I didn't even get the two weeks
vacation pay due to me.

493
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:57,568
My father made mistakes.

494
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,186
He hurt people.

495
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:03,307
When people are hurt,
people are in trouble,

496
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:06,160
they tend to make
the wrong choices.

497
00:24:07,329 --> 00:24:09,146
Right, Derek?

498
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:11,615
But those choices
don't have to define you,

499
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,918
they don't have to define
who your family will be,

500
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,121
because there's always
one moment

501
00:24:17,123 --> 00:24:18,973
when you can turn it
all around.

502
00:24:18,975 --> 00:24:22,293

That doesn't help me

No, it doesn't.

No, all I can offer you

511
00:24:39,345 --> 00:24:42,530
Queen Consolidated has
subsidiaries all over the country.

How about I still have
some pride left?

515

Ok.

518

If you change your mind...

519
00:25:09,392 --> 00:25:12,810
You and I have
one thing in common.

520
00:25:12,812 --> 00:25:14,226
We're both dealing
with the consequences

521
00:25:14,251 --> 00:25:16,251
of our fathers' actions.

522
00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:20,151
What he did then,
that's on him.

523
00:25:20,153 --> 00:25:22,403
What we do now,

524
00:25:22,405 --> 00:25:25,740
that's on us.

525
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:33,364
I've been thinking, baby,
maybe you were right.

526
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:34,865
Maybe it's time
to hang it up, retire.

527
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:36,367
But Kyle says
we do one more

528
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:37,868
or he'll go out
on his own.

529
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,870
Well, if that's what he wants to do,
that's his right,

530
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,905
but you and me

00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,929
I dropped a bug
in Derek Reston's jacket.

534
00:25:48,931 --> 00:25:51,132
I thought you were going
to give the man a second chance.

That's what I believe in.

After all this time,
we wants to end up a winner.

00:32:22,391 --> 00:32:24,875
He's just knocked out.

644
00:32:24,877 --> 00:32:27,494
It wasn't his fault.

645
00:32:27,496 --> 00:32:29,914
I turned my son into this.

646
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,425
Of course it doesn't work.

647
00:32:41,427 --> 00:32:44,345
I'm hallucinating.
Or I'm dreaming.

648
00:32:44,347 --> 00:32:46,380
But if you weren't...

649
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:48,899
You betrayed me, Oliver.

650
00:32:48,901 --> 00:32:52,036
I died so that you could live,
and you threw that gift away.

651
00:32:52,038 --> 00:32:55,306
You made that sacrifice empty.

652
00:32:55,308 --> 00:32:58,725
I'm not you.
I'm not.

653
00:32:58,727 --> 00:33:02,446
I'm not strong like you.
I never was.

654
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:05,115
I told you, I'm not
the man you think I am.

655
00:33:05,117 --> 00:33:07,734
The things I've done.

656
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:09,536
What I was about to do.

657
00:33:09,538 --> 00:33:13,090
Dad... Dad.

658
00:33:13,092 --> 00:33:14,925
What does that mean?

659
00:33:14,927 --> 00:33:17,244
Please?

660
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:18,712
I don't know
what that means.

661
00:33:18,714 --> 00:33:21,849
I told you.
I begged you.

662
00:33:21,851 --> 00:33:24,918
Right my wrongs!

663
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,354
This is your responsibility now.

664
00:33:27,356 --> 00:33:29,356
How?

665
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:34,395
How do I do this?

666
00:33:36,731 --> 00:33:39,099
I can't even
get off this island.

667
00:33:42,203 --> 00:33:46,606
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
the truth about me.

668
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:47,941
But I hope...

669
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:49,660
I hope that you know

670
00:33:49,662 --> 00:33:51,996
that I love you.

671
00:34:27,177 --> 00:34:29,677
Did you know
that as a doctor,

672
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,346
I was able
to diagnose myself

673
00:34:31,348 --> 00:34:33,681
as a giant tool?

674
00:34:35,485 --> 00:34:37,486
How about a dance,
handsome?

675
00:34:37,488 --> 00:34:39,821
Hey, uh, I thought
that we agreed

676
00:34:39,823 --> 00:34:41,306
that you were going
to call me before

677
00:34:41,331 --> 00:34:42,910
you did something stupid.

678
00:34:43,494 --> 00:34:45,860
You're no fun.

679
00:34:45,862 --> 00:34:48,696
I'm going to show
you how to have some fun.

680
00:34:48,698 --> 00:34:50,248
Whoa, whoa,
what are you doing?

681
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:53,185
You said I was amazing.

682
00:34:53,187 --> 00:34:55,887
Yeah, you are amazing,
but you're also like my sister.

683
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:57,422
My baby sister.

684
00:34:57,424 --> 00:35:00,041
Well, I'm not
a baby anymore.

685
00:35:00,043 --> 00:35:03,044
Thank you for noticing.

686
00:35:04,981 --> 00:35:07,816
Laurel
doesn't even like you.

687
00:35:07,818 --> 00:35:10,569
She doesn't
understand you.

688
00:35:10,571 --> 00:35:12,220
I do.

689
00:35:12,222 --> 00:35:14,072
Why can't you
just see that?

690
00:35:14,074 --> 00:35:17,242
Thea. Thea,
it was a mistake

691
00:35:17,244 --> 00:35:18,560
to talk to you

692
00:35:18,562 --> 00:35:20,028
about girls and stuff.

693
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:22,397
It was inappropriate, and I think
it may have confused you.

694
00:35:22,399 --> 00:35:24,166
Yeah, the rejection?

695
00:35:24,168 --> 00:35:26,585
It is pretty clear.
Even if it wasn't,

696
00:35:26,587 --> 00:35:29,070
between my mom and Oliver

697
00:35:29,072 --> 00:35:32,507
and everybody
in my entire life,

698
00:35:32,509 --> 00:35:35,260
I'm pretty much used to it
by now, so...

699
00:35:36,262 --> 00:35:38,013
Whoa, whoa.

700
00:35:38,015 --> 00:35:40,765
Ok, let's go,
let's go, come on.

701
00:35:42,269 --> 00:35:44,936
- Tommy?
- Yep.

702
00:35:44,938 --> 00:35:46,388
Is Thea okay?

703
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:49,090
Oh, yeah, she just ate
some bad crab cakes.

704
00:35:49,092 --> 00:35:51,977
Are you sure it wasn't
something she drank?

705
00:35:51,979 --> 00:35:54,563
Ahem. Don't worry.
I got this.

706
00:35:54,565 --> 00:35:56,364
You can go back inside.
Keep having fun.

707
00:35:56,366 --> 00:35:59,034
Looked like you were having a nice
little do-si-do with the good doctor.

708
00:35:59,036 --> 00:36:01,786
Tommy, I'm going to let you in
on a little-known secret

709
00:36:01,788 --> 00:36:04,873
about Dr. Carter Bowen.

710
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:06,908
The man is a gigantic ass.

711
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:09,944
And the only reason
why I danced with him

712
00:36:09,946 --> 00:36:12,631
is because he wrote
a massive check to CNRI.

713
00:36:12,633 --> 00:36:14,633
Why would you think
anything else?

714
00:36:14,635 --> 00:36:19,821
I guess when it comes
to you, I tend not to think straight.

715
00:36:22,958 --> 00:36:25,293
Can you call me a cab?

716
00:36:25,295 --> 00:36:27,295
Absolutely not.
I am taking you home.

717
00:36:27,297 --> 00:36:29,481
Get in.

718
00:36:29,483 --> 00:36:32,300
I apologize
for making such a scene.

719
00:36:32,302 --> 00:36:34,102
Just feel better, okay?

720
00:36:38,241 --> 00:36:40,025
Hey, Tommy.

721
00:36:40,027 --> 00:36:42,143
I owe you a dance.

722
00:36:42,145 --> 00:36:44,029
Yeah?

723
00:36:44,031 --> 00:36:46,915
You earned it.

724
00:36:59,995 --> 00:37:02,297
Please don't hate me.

725
00:37:02,299 --> 00:37:04,299
No, no.

726
00:37:04,301 --> 00:37:07,185
Never.

727
00:37:22,851 --> 00:37:26,237
What went down
wasn't your fault.

728
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:28,189
I didn't say it was.

729
00:37:28,191 --> 00:37:31,943
Oliver, it wasn't
your fault, man.

730
00:37:31,945 --> 00:37:33,378
You gave Reston a chance.

731
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,163
That was more
than he deserved.

732
00:37:35,165 --> 00:37:37,098
I'm not so sure
about that.

733
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,634
Well, listen,
I'll tell you this much.

734
00:37:39,636 --> 00:37:42,203
You say going after
the guys on that list

735
00:37:42,205 --> 00:37:45,390
is the way you honored
your dad?

736
00:37:45,392 --> 00:37:48,727
Well, if your dad
could have seen you this week,

737
00:37:48,729 --> 00:37:51,997
the way you cared
about the people he had hurt,

738
00:37:51,999 --> 00:37:55,433
the way you stepped up
to try to help them,

739
00:37:55,435 --> 00:37:58,770
I'd say he'd be
pretty damn honored.

740
00:37:58,772 --> 00:38:04,392
So maybe there is more
than one way to save this city?

741
00:38:04,394 --> 00:38:06,311
Maybe.

742
00:38:08,197 --> 00:38:11,116
By the way,
Stan Washington woke up.

743
00:38:13,953 --> 00:38:17,555
He's going to be fine.

744
00:39:10,976 --> 00:39:13,611
My responsibility.

745
00:39:17,016 --> 00:39:19,984
I promise, Dad.

746
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,688
I promise.

747
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:37,035
Nightcap?

748
00:39:37,037 --> 00:39:39,087
Well, I thought
it might help me.

749
00:39:39,089 --> 00:39:41,923
I--I don't
sleep well alone.

750
00:39:49,048 --> 00:39:52,300
I'm sorry about
what I said tonight.

751
00:39:52,302 --> 00:39:54,102
No.

752
00:39:54,104 --> 00:39:57,105
You were being honest.

753
00:39:57,107 --> 00:40:00,258
No, not entirely.

754
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:03,678
The truth is, with Walter
being gone, I'm...

755
00:40:06,182 --> 00:40:07,682
I'm lonely.

756
00:40:09,585 --> 00:40:11,453
You know, you and I
used to talk.

757
00:40:11,455 --> 00:40:13,655
I used to know what
you were thinking.

758
00:40:13,657 --> 00:40:15,907
But now, even when
you're home,

759
00:40:15,909 --> 00:40:18,059
you're somewhere
else. I...

760
00:40:20,379 --> 00:40:23,198
I guess I just
miss my son.

761
00:40:25,618 --> 00:40:28,019
I miss you, too.

762
00:40:29,421 --> 00:40:33,057
And I wish that...

763
00:40:37,813 --> 00:40:40,548
Are you hungry?

764
00:40:42,568 --> 00:40:44,486
Thank you.

765
00:40:50,326 --> 00:40:52,076
All right.

766
00:40:52,078 --> 00:40:55,747
Mmm. Mom--

767
00:40:55,749 --> 00:40:58,283
It's okay to get your hands
dirty every once in a while.

768
00:40:58,285 --> 00:41:00,285
For me. Please.

769
00:41:03,255 --> 00:41:05,540
All right.

770
00:41:08,243 --> 00:41:10,077
- Mmm.
- Mm-hmm.

771
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,079
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

772
00:41:12,081 --> 00:41:15,266
That is a great burger.

773
00:41:15,268 --> 00:41:17,769
- Thank you for this.
- Anytime.

774
00:41:17,771 --> 00:41:19,253
You know, I'll bet
Carter Bowen

775
00:41:19,255 --> 00:41:21,272
doesn't know where to find
the best burger joint

776
00:41:21,274 --> 00:41:22,290
in Starling City.

777
00:41:22,292 --> 00:41:25,092
So I have one thing on him.

778
00:41:25,094 --> 00:41:27,228
No.

779
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:29,764
You have
everything on him.
