
1
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,095
<i>There's a legend that precedes
the dawn of our civilization.</i>

2
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:05,572
<i>A vile god,
so large and so powerful</i>

3
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:09,543
<i>that it consumed entire planets as fuel.</i>

4
00:01:09,578 --> 00:01:12,040
<i>Few believed such a thing could be true,</i>

5
00:01:12,075 --> 00:01:17,584
<i>until the day we saw Unicron
with our own eyes.</i>

6
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,445
<i>But he didn't just come for our planet.</i>

7
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:46,679
<i>He wanted our greatest technology,</i>

8
00:01:46,714 --> 00:01:48,978
<i>the Transwarp Key.</i>

9
00:01:49,013 --> 00:01:53,356
<i>And he sent his most powerful
henchman to collect it,</i>

10
00:01:53,391 --> 00:01:55,193
<i>Scourge.</i>

11
00:02:44,409 --> 00:02:45,969
More enemies are landing.

12
00:02:46,004 --> 00:02:47,410
We won't be safe for long.

13
00:02:47,445 --> 00:02:48,675
Do we have the key?

14
00:02:50,074 --> 00:02:51,546
You must take it.

15
00:02:51,581 --> 00:02:53,383
Keep it hidden,

16
00:02:53,418 --> 00:02:56,254
so that it never falls
into the hands of Unicron.

17
00:02:56,289 --> 00:02:58,982
But, Apelinq, we can fight.

18
00:02:59,017 --> 00:03:02,887
No. Protecting our Transwarp
Key is all that matters!

19
00:03:02,922 --> 00:03:05,021
Go. Use it to escape.

20
00:03:05,056 --> 00:03:06,858
What will you do?

21
00:03:08,026 --> 00:03:09,861
I'll hold him off.

22
00:03:10,633 --> 00:03:11,731
Buy you some time.

23
00:03:12,503 --> 00:03:13,733
Then I'm staying with you.

24
00:03:13,768 --> 00:03:15,867
This is my fight.

25
00:03:15,902 --> 00:03:20,036
Listen, if Unicron were to get the key,

26
00:03:20,071 --> 00:03:22,379
he could open a portal through time and space

27
00:03:22,414 --> 00:03:25,239
with no end to the worlds he could destroy.

28
00:03:25,274 --> 00:03:29,144
It is now your time to lead the Maximals,

29
00:03:29,179 --> 00:03:31,212
Optimus Primal.

30
00:03:53,412 --> 00:03:57,612
So you're this planet's great warrior.

31
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:04,388
Mmm.
You have such a beautiful world

32
00:04:06,282 --> 00:04:09,954
filled with an abundance of life.

33
00:04:11,254 --> 00:04:14,299
Savory.

34
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,962
My master grows hungry.

35
00:04:17,997 --> 00:04:23,902
Give me the Transwarp Key,
and he will spare your home.

36
00:04:23,937 --> 00:04:27,444
We'd rather die than let
him reach other planets.

37
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:30,942
So be it.

38
00:04:46,861 --> 00:04:50,500
Benefits of serving the almighty Unicron.

39
00:04:53,901 --> 00:04:56,297
They never learn.

40
00:04:56,332 --> 00:04:59,267
You're too late, Scourge.

41
00:04:59,302 --> 00:05:02,974
Your master will be trapped
in this galaxy forever.

42
00:05:07,981 --> 00:05:09,651
No!

43
00:05:15,285 --> 00:05:17,626
<i>His sacrifice will be our oath.</i>

44
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:19,826
<i>To preserve the key,</i>

45
00:05:20,565 --> 00:05:22,290
<i>no matter the cost.</i>

46
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:36,447
You let them slip away
with the Transwarp Key.

47
00:05:36,482 --> 00:05:40,979
Scour the universe and find
where the Maximals have gone.

48
00:05:41,014 --> 00:05:45,852
When you acquire the key,
use it to bring me to you.

49
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,118
Yes, my lord.

50
00:05:48,153 --> 00:05:54,223
Once I have the key,
I alone will reign supreme.

51
00:06:54,285 --> 00:06:56,725
All right, baby, come on.

52
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,353
Show me the money.
Show me the money.

53
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,129
Here we go. There we go.

54
00:07:05,164 --> 00:07:07,461
<i>Yo, Sonic. Breakfast ready yet?</i>

55
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:10,739
I ain't your butler, Kris.

56
00:07:10,774 --> 00:07:13,467
<i>Come on, man.
No names over the airwaves.</i>

57
00:07:13,502 --> 00:07:14,710
<i>It's Tails.</i>

58
00:07:15,647 --> 00:07:16,943
Oh, my bad,

59
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:20,111
Kristopher Diaz from 974 Wilson Avenue,

60
00:07:20,146 --> 00:07:21,948
Apartment 2-C, Brooklyn.

61
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,247
<i>No real names.
They're listening.</i>

62
00:07:24,282 --> 00:07:27,657
Ain't no secret government agencies
worried about us, Tails.

63
00:07:27,692 --> 00:07:29,758
Now get your behind out here
while it's hot.

64
00:07:29,793 --> 00:07:32,794
At least they got that going for 'em.
Here, I ironed this for you.

65
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:35,390
I already ironed it. What...
Like you cooked those eggs?

66
00:07:35,425 --> 00:07:37,997
What you mean?
They're just... seasoned.

67
00:07:38,032 --> 00:07:40,296
Aw, come on.

68
00:07:40,331 --> 00:07:41,572
Come eat, bro.

69
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,234
I can't get past Bowser.

70
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:45,708
Well, good morning to you too.

71
00:07:45,743 --> 00:07:47,611
Drink this and take your medicine.

72
00:07:47,646 --> 00:07:49,745
- All of it.
- Okay.

73
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,274
Are you sure you can take him?

74
00:07:51,309 --> 00:07:53,980
Yeah, uh, hospital's on the way.
I got time.

75
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,851
And, if that lady,
that administrator, is there

76
00:07:56,886 --> 00:07:58,380
and she mentions a bill,

77
00:07:58,415 --> 00:07:59,447
just...

78
00:08:00,417 --> 00:08:02,824
tell her we're handling it.

79
00:08:02,859 --> 00:08:05,596
I will. And after today,
I'll be able to help out more.

80
00:08:06,698 --> 00:08:08,192
Good luck on the interview.

81
00:08:08,227 --> 00:08:10,832
Don't forget to laugh at all their jokes.

82
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:13,934
White people love that shit.
Ma, language.

83
00:08:13,969 --> 00:08:17,531
Okay! Remember, I have
class tonight, so I'll be home late.

84
00:08:17,566 --> 00:08:19,203
<i>Los quiero.</i>
I love you.

85
00:08:19,238 --> 00:08:21,711
Hurry up, man.
We gotta get into the city.

86
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:27,684
Hey. Hold up. Hold up.

87
00:08:27,719 --> 00:08:29,345
Your hand's hurting again?

88
00:08:30,348 --> 00:08:32,018
No, it's nothing.

89
00:08:32,757 --> 00:08:34,020
Yo, let me see.

90
00:08:36,453 --> 00:08:37,859
Kris.

91
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,359
It's swollen.

92
00:08:43,394 --> 00:08:46,263
The sickle cells must be
blocking the blood flow again.

93
00:08:46,298 --> 00:08:47,836
How long has this been going on?

94
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,332
Couple days.

95
00:08:50,434 --> 00:08:52,236
Hey, yo, look, I told you,

96
00:08:52,271 --> 00:08:53,875
you gotta tell me these things.

97
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,537
You fighting this alone,
or we fighting it together?

98
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,078
Together.

99
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,949
Home team?

100
00:09:01,984 --> 00:09:03,148
Home team.

101
00:09:10,124 --> 00:09:12,762
Two for ten. Two for...
Stop touching everything.

102
00:09:12,797 --> 00:09:14,830
Oh, hell, no.
Kris, what'd I tell you

103
00:09:14,865 --> 00:09:17,899
about letting your mans come out
the crib looking like a whole square?

104
00:09:17,934 --> 00:09:19,901
Only so much I can do.

105
00:09:19,936 --> 00:09:21,771
Yeah, whatever, bro.
Look. Here.

106
00:09:21,806 --> 00:09:24,334
Ooh!
My dawg!

107
00:09:24,369 --> 00:09:27,942
When you gonna let me put your skills
to work and get you some real money?

108
00:09:27,977 --> 00:09:30,175
Yeah. Says the dude
who can't even afford cable.

109
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,649
"Says the guy who..."

110
00:09:31,684 --> 00:09:33,607
I choose not to purchase cable.

111
00:09:33,642 --> 00:09:36,379
It's my own personal way
to protest the vampiric nature

112
00:09:36,414 --> 00:09:38,348
of modern-day capitalism!

113
00:09:38,383 --> 00:09:40,790
Hey, good luck with that
interview in that dusty suit!

114
00:10:04,343 --> 00:10:06,112
Ugh!
I'm coming.

115
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,718
Hey, guys.
That's a good one,

116
00:10:07,753 --> 00:10:09,786
but the Ankylosaurus was an armored dinosaur.

117
00:10:24,132 --> 00:10:26,803
- Thank you, thank you...
- ...for being patient.

118
00:10:26,838 --> 00:10:28,398
Intern?
Intern?

119
00:10:28,433 --> 00:10:31,170
I paged you three times.
Why didn't you call me?

120
00:10:31,205 --> 00:10:34,338
Okay, well, I figured if I stopped to call,
that would make me later.

121
00:10:34,373 --> 00:10:36,780
The police are here.

122
00:10:36,815 --> 00:10:38,639
They busted an art auction.

123
00:10:38,674 --> 00:10:41,345
The owner claims that everything is authentic,

124
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,886
but they want a second opinion.

125
00:10:45,318 --> 00:10:46,350
All right.

126
00:10:49,718 --> 00:10:51,685
The da Vinci sketch is legit.

127
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,324
The painting's a copy.

128
00:10:53,359 --> 00:10:55,359
Real one's at the National Gallery in London.

129
00:10:56,835 --> 00:10:58,626
Roman vase.

130
00:10:58,661 --> 00:11:02,168
Valuable, but you are not
gonna retire off of them.

131
00:11:04,843 --> 00:11:07,305
This Greek curse tablet,
it would be expensive,

132
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,570
but it's a fake.

133
00:11:08,605 --> 00:11:10,143
How can you tell?

134
00:11:10,178 --> 00:11:12,750
See the spelling?
Roman.

135
00:11:12,785 --> 00:11:14,477
Doesn't even show up in that era.

136
00:11:14,512 --> 00:11:16,182
Got it.

137
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:19,823
Officers, I figured it out. So...

138
00:11:19,858 --> 00:11:23,552
The da Vinci, that is real.

139
00:11:31,034 --> 00:11:34,662
Hmm.
Now, where did you come from?

140
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,920
What are you?

141
00:11:50,955 --> 00:11:53,549
It's pretty neat, right?
Yes.

142
00:11:53,584 --> 00:11:55,716
Where is it from?

143
00:11:55,751 --> 00:11:57,586
They just discovered it in Sudan.

144
00:11:57,621 --> 00:12:01,557
The boys say it's Horus,
fifth millennia BC, Nubian?

145
00:12:01,592 --> 00:12:04,725
This symbol is definitely not hieroglyphic.

146
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,431
Well, if it's as exotic as it looks,

147
00:12:07,466 --> 00:12:09,367
I'm gonna get a feature in <i>Minerva.</i>

148
00:12:10,073 --> 00:12:12,139
Uh, Jillian?

149
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:16,341
Okay, team, let's do it.

150
00:12:34,757 --> 00:12:35,998
Okay, what are the rules?

151
00:12:37,397 --> 00:12:38,968
Bros before hos.

152
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,137
"Don't be a problem.

153
00:12:43,172 --> 00:12:44,666
Don't go looking for a problem."

154
00:12:44,701 --> 00:12:46,800
- Or else we're gonna...
- Have a problem.

155
00:12:46,835 --> 00:12:48,109
I know, I know.

156
00:12:48,144 --> 00:12:49,638
Okay, I'll be back in a little bit.

157
00:12:56,581 --> 00:12:58,152
Mr. Diaz?

158
00:12:59,683 --> 00:13:01,991
Hey, I know we're a little behind on the bill.

159
00:13:02,026 --> 00:13:05,104
Three months behind. Until your account
is current, you can't bring your brother.

160
00:13:05,128 --> 00:13:06,754
I've told you that.
I'm gonna fix it.

161
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:09,262
I need a little more time.
Take him to the ER.

162
00:13:09,297 --> 00:13:11,825
Well, they won't see him in
the ER unless he's critical.

163
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:13,398
Mr. Diaz.
He's 11!

164
00:13:14,665 --> 00:13:16,170
He's 11 years old.

165
00:13:18,834 --> 00:13:21,604
Come on, Kris,
we gotta go.

166
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:24,772
What happened?
I'll tell you later, man. All right?

167
00:13:24,807 --> 00:13:26,312
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

168
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:30,811
Hey, yo.
Sit here.

169
00:13:33,189 --> 00:13:35,519
And don't move!

170
00:13:35,554 --> 00:13:38,533
<i>After a conference
with Simpson's attorney, Howard Weitzman...</i>

171
00:13:38,557 --> 00:13:40,656
Can I help you?
Yes.

172
00:13:40,691 --> 00:13:42,834
Hey, I'm here for an interview
with the head of security, Mr. Bishop.

173
00:13:42,858 --> 00:13:44,594
I'm Noah Diaz.

174
00:13:44,629 --> 00:13:46,970
It's been canceled. No.
No, that has to be a mistake.

175
00:13:47,005 --> 00:13:48,829
Came right from Mr. Bishop.

176
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:52,866
Just need your authorization...

177
00:13:52,901 --> 00:13:54,703
Mr. Bishop!
Hey! Hey!

178
00:13:54,738 --> 00:13:57,211
It's okay, Walker.

179
00:13:57,246 --> 00:14:00,445
It's me, Noah Diaz.
Sir, I think your boy back there is confused.

180
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,810
He said our interview was canceled.
Because it is.

181
00:14:02,845 --> 00:14:05,483
Wait, why? On the phone you
said I was perfect for the job.

182
00:14:05,518 --> 00:14:07,221
You said this was just a formality.

183
00:14:07,256 --> 00:14:09,817
It was until your old commanding
officer called me back.

184
00:14:09,852 --> 00:14:13,326
Said you were brave,
an expert comtech, but unreliable.

185
00:14:13,361 --> 00:14:14,789
Couldn't trust you.

186
00:14:14,824 --> 00:14:16,593
Your head was always somewhere else.

187
00:14:16,628 --> 00:14:18,562
Sir, I can explain all of that.

188
00:14:18,597 --> 00:14:20,949
I had some responsibilities at home.
My brother, he's sick...

189
00:14:20,973 --> 00:14:23,336
You had a responsibility
to the United States Army.

190
00:14:23,371 --> 00:14:25,437
Mr. Bishop! Sir.

191
00:14:25,472 --> 00:14:28,044
I'm a hard worker, okay?
I just...

192
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,773
I just really need a break.

193
00:14:31,808 --> 00:14:35,645
Listen, I can't have someone like you
mess up what I've built.

194
00:14:36,318 --> 00:14:37,922
Someone like me?

195
00:14:43,391 --> 00:14:45,193
You don't know anything about me!

196
00:14:45,228 --> 00:14:47,789
I know you don't know how to be part of a team.

197
00:14:50,398 --> 00:14:51,463
God.

198
00:14:52,796 --> 00:14:54,070
Hey, look.

199
00:14:54,105 --> 00:14:55,632
Superman went on a bunch of interviews

200
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:58,701
before he got his job
on the <i>Daily Planet.</i>

201
00:14:58,736 --> 00:15:01,539
But he never gave up.
I'm not Superman, Kris.

202
00:15:01,574 --> 00:15:03,046
Life ain't a comic book.

203
00:15:03,081 --> 00:15:05,411
I'm just saying.
You'll get the next one.

204
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,578
Yo, there is no next one.

205
00:15:07,613 --> 00:15:10,020
No one's coming to save us.
We're alone in this.

206
00:15:19,196 --> 00:15:20,360
Yo, man, I'm sorry.

207
00:15:21,396 --> 00:15:22,428
It's all right.

208
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,693
No, it's not.

209
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:28,698
None of this is.

210
00:15:36,312 --> 00:15:37,575
You know what?

211
00:15:38,545 --> 00:15:39,610
Come on.

212
00:15:41,845 --> 00:15:43,944
Yo, here, bro.

213
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:46,584
Just head upstairs.
I'll be right there, all right?

214
00:15:51,426 --> 00:15:53,294
So what was you
talking about earlier?

215
00:16:13,151 --> 00:16:14,348
Hey, yo, you want one?

216
00:16:14,383 --> 00:16:16,647
No. I don't want any candy.

217
00:16:16,682 --> 00:16:18,550
You gotta relax, man.

218
00:16:18,585 --> 00:16:20,651
Your energy is really affecting my chi.

219
00:16:20,686 --> 00:16:23,192
And I get it.
I was nervous my first time too.

220
00:16:23,227 --> 00:16:26,227
But you might want to do some breathing exercises,
or something. Look at me.

221
00:16:32,599 --> 00:16:34,302
My man, my man, my man, my man.

222
00:16:35,305 --> 00:16:37,965
It's just I ain't done this before.

223
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,704
I know that.
But them rich cats in there,

224
00:16:40,739 --> 00:16:42,805
they give a ton of paper
to charities every year

225
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,807
to make themselves feel better.

226
00:16:44,842 --> 00:16:47,744
If you look at it from a holistic perspective,
we doing them a favor.

227
00:16:49,154 --> 00:16:52,045
Hey, yo!
You're welcome! Will you stop?

228
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,587
What are you doing? This ain't
about to affect they pockets at all.

229
00:16:55,622 --> 00:16:57,325
And it's about to be easy as hell.

230
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,789
So why you ain't the one
going in there and doing it?

231
00:16:59,824 --> 00:17:02,264
Because, <i>papito,</i>
I'm the mastermind.

232
00:17:02,299 --> 00:17:05,168
Now come on,
put this in your ear.

233
00:17:05,203 --> 00:17:07,896
My man, you serious?
Yo, is that even clean?

234
00:17:07,931 --> 00:17:11,570
It's the fourth quarter,
we got about ten seconds left on the clock,

235
00:17:11,605 --> 00:17:13,275
and you got the rock.

236
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:15,475
Get rid of this.
Hey, man!

237
00:17:16,808 --> 00:17:19,083
Don't slam the...

238
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,652
Okay.
I am off to my fundraiser.

239
00:17:27,687 --> 00:17:30,017
What do you think?
It's nice.

240
00:17:30,052 --> 00:17:33,790
Um, can I...
Can I run something by you?

241
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,026
So I've been doing some research,

242
00:17:39,061 --> 00:17:42,238
and I don't think that the statuette is Horus.

243
00:17:42,273 --> 00:17:44,372
As a matter of fact,
I'm sure it's not.

244
00:17:44,407 --> 00:17:47,100
The boys dated it around 5000 BC, right?

245
00:17:47,135 --> 00:17:48,706
Mm-hmm.

246
00:17:48,741 --> 00:17:50,180
But the Nubians,

247
00:17:50,215 --> 00:17:51,918
they never even had contact
with the Egyptians

248
00:17:51,942 --> 00:17:53,810
until 600 years after that.

249
00:17:53,845 --> 00:17:55,680
The symbol's not hieroglyphic.

250
00:17:55,715 --> 00:17:57,594
I don't even think it's
from that part of the world.

251
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,783
I think it might be Aztec or Inca.

252
00:18:01,655 --> 00:18:04,524
It's not some Egyptian god.
It's something else.

253
00:18:09,894 --> 00:18:11,531
Interesting.

254
00:18:11,566 --> 00:18:12,796
Get those pressed, okay?

255
00:18:35,183 --> 00:18:37,051
<i>Yeah.</i>

256
00:18:37,086 --> 00:18:40,626
There you go.
Let that breath fill you up.

257
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:43,431
<i>In... out.</i>

258
00:18:43,466 --> 00:18:45,499
Please stop talking.

259
00:18:45,534 --> 00:18:48,172
Okay, all right, I get it,
you don't like to chitchat back and forth.

260
00:18:48,196 --> 00:18:49,503
But I got something for you.

261
00:18:53,773 --> 00:18:55,740
You got a robbing mixtape?

262
00:18:55,775 --> 00:18:56,807
<i>Uh, no.</i>

263
00:18:56,842 --> 00:18:59,282
I got a liberating mixtape.

264
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:13,659
You feeling that, huh?

265
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:14,726
Yeah, whatever.

266
00:19:21,064 --> 00:19:24,373
<i>All right, there shouldn't
be nobody in this part of the building.</i>

267
00:19:24,408 --> 00:19:26,474
<i>You should be able
to just waltz right on in.</i>

268
00:19:30,645 --> 00:19:32,810
Strike one, mastermind.
This place is packed.

269
00:19:32,845 --> 00:19:35,109
Hey, well, to error is divine.

270
00:19:35,144 --> 00:19:36,979
<i>Just act like you own the place.</i>

271
00:19:37,014 --> 00:19:39,619
Hey, wassup, brother?
Good to see you again.

272
00:19:39,654 --> 00:19:42,182
<i>Try not to look suspicious.</i>

273
00:19:44,494 --> 00:19:47,660
Here you go. Here you go.
Sorry. Sorry. That's you, bro.

274
00:19:47,695 --> 00:19:50,498
Nice glasses. I didn't know...
I didn't know you had glasses.

275
00:19:50,533 --> 00:19:52,566
<i>What are you doing,
making friends?</i>

276
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:03,280
<i>Everything good?</i>
We're in the mix.

277
00:20:07,682 --> 00:20:10,914
Hey. Let's see what you really are.

278
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:23,597
<i>Now, my man said
it's tucked in the back.</i>

279
00:20:23,632 --> 00:20:25,192
Been there a couple weeks.

280
00:20:26,294 --> 00:20:28,030
<i>It's like a grayish car</i>

281
00:20:28,065 --> 00:20:29,339
<i>with like a...</i>

282
00:20:29,374 --> 00:20:31,066
Blue stripe.

283
00:20:46,754 --> 00:20:49,183
<i>All right, now just
like brother Reek showed you.</i>

284
00:20:49,218 --> 00:20:50,393
Down the window...

285
00:20:51,924 --> 00:20:53,088
...a little wiggle...

286
00:20:53,123 --> 00:20:55,926
...feel that snag and...

287
00:20:57,468 --> 00:20:58,599
<i>...yeah.</i>

288
00:20:58,634 --> 00:21:00,304
Now we making money.

289
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,924
All right.
Talk to me, homey.

290
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:28,057
<i>I'm in.</i>

291
00:21:28,092 --> 00:21:29,322
This won't hurt a bit.

292
00:21:44,977 --> 00:21:47,175
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

293
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,884
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

294
00:21:58,155 --> 00:22:01,090
I'm gonna lose my job.

295
00:22:03,193 --> 00:22:05,358
I'm gonna go to jail.

296
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:24,080
It's definitely not Nubian.

297
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:04,186
This cannot be.

298
00:23:04,221 --> 00:23:07,222
Calling all Autobots!
Calling all Autobots!

299
00:23:07,257 --> 00:23:08,894
<i>Yippee-ki-yay, mother...</i>

300
00:23:15,298 --> 00:23:17,903
Prime, this is Arcee.
I have a visual.

301
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,234
What am I looking at?

302
00:23:20,677 --> 00:23:22,138
A way home.

303
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:29,013
<i>Calling all Autobots!</i>

304
00:23:29,048 --> 00:23:31,180
<i>Calling all Autobots!</i>

305
00:23:35,527 --> 00:23:38,121
- What am I doing?
<i>- Well, the coast is clear out here,</i>

306
00:23:38,156 --> 00:23:40,794
<i>so whenever you want to slide
that thing on out, you good.</i>

307
00:23:40,829 --> 00:23:42,532
I can't. I can't.

308
00:23:42,567 --> 00:23:44,633
<i>Like you can't drive stick or something?</i>

309
00:23:44,668 --> 00:23:47,262
No, it's just...
I ain't no thief.

310
00:23:47,297 --> 00:23:49,462
<i>Are you having
an existential crisis now?</i>

311
00:23:49,497 --> 00:23:51,585
The deadline for that was
when I offered you Twizzlers.

312
00:23:51,609 --> 00:23:53,466
<i>This is an emergency.</i>

313
00:23:53,501 --> 00:23:55,435
<i>Can you hear me, Mirage?
Roll out!</i>

314
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,305
Who the hell was that?

315
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,648
That's the radio, bro.
This car is buggin'. I'm out.

316
00:24:01,817 --> 00:24:02,817
Hey!

317
00:24:03,621 --> 00:24:04,653
Shit!

318
00:24:04,688 --> 00:24:06,754
Oh, shit.
Hey, you!

319
00:24:08,516 --> 00:24:10,956
Get out of the car!

320
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:14,058
I'm trying!
The car started by itself, I promise!

321
00:24:14,093 --> 00:24:15,763
Look, it's not working!
Get out now!

322
00:24:24,466 --> 00:24:26,433
No! Wait!
What you doing?

323
00:24:26,468 --> 00:24:27,709
Noah, what's...

324
00:24:30,846 --> 00:24:33,407
Reek! Reek! Reek!

325
00:24:33,442 --> 00:24:35,277
Now, that's top-tier manifestation!

326
00:24:36,544 --> 00:24:38,379
Yo, the car's driving by itself!

327
00:24:40,548 --> 00:24:41,822
Noah, you good?

328
00:24:41,857 --> 00:24:43,186
I don't know what's going on!

329
00:24:43,221 --> 00:24:44,660
It won't stop!

330
00:24:44,695 --> 00:24:46,992
Yo, stop! Stop!
Why aren't you listening?

331
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,456
You might wanna slow down.
It's not me, it's the car!

332
00:24:49,491 --> 00:24:51,128
- It's possessed!
<i>- No, no, no.</i>

333
00:24:51,163 --> 00:24:52,866
You're just on an adrenaline high.

334
00:24:52,901 --> 00:24:54,835
Let's do some of them breathing exercises.

335
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,069
Yo, I don't need no breathing exercises!

336
00:24:58,104 --> 00:24:59,466
The car's driving by itself!

337
00:25:01,074 --> 00:25:02,909
Oh, snap.

338
00:25:02,944 --> 00:25:04,845
Yo, Reek, what do we do?

339
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,847
Noah, I cannot hear you.

340
00:25:06,882 --> 00:25:08,541
<i>Reek!</i>
Noah, I can't...

341
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:13,887
No, he did not!
No, he did not just leave me!

342
00:25:16,386 --> 00:25:18,518
Pull over!
Help me!

343
00:25:51,927 --> 00:25:53,322
Oh! Are you ok...

344
00:26:00,232 --> 00:26:02,771
Drive. Drive, drive, drive, drive, drive!

345
00:26:16,314 --> 00:26:18,655
The bridge.
The bridge, the bridge...

346
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:19,920
Take the Williamsburg!

347
00:26:28,623 --> 00:26:31,393
I got a 10-37 in progress.
Silver Porsche.

348
00:26:33,804 --> 00:26:35,199
You serious, man?

349
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,811
Oh, nah.
Oh, nah.

350
00:26:50,821 --> 00:26:52,447
Hell, do something, please!

351
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:08,837
Yo, nah. Nah, nah, nah.

352
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,438
<i>Come in, come in.</i>

353
00:27:16,473 --> 00:27:18,473
<i>Can you hear me, Mirage?</i>
Mir-what?

354
00:27:30,795 --> 00:27:33,488
Oh, Mirage.

355
00:27:54,511 --> 00:27:56,786
Yo, yo, yo, slow down!
Slow down!

356
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:11,867
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
That felt good!

357
00:28:11,902 --> 00:28:15,563
Get some oil pumping, you know?
Damn!

358
00:28:15,598 --> 00:28:17,301
I've been cooped up forever, dude.

359
00:28:17,336 --> 00:28:19,336
I can't tell you how old it gets!

360
00:28:19,371 --> 00:28:21,338
"Mirage, stay hidden.

361
00:28:21,373 --> 00:28:24,506
Mirage, don't draw any attention to yourself.

362
00:28:24,541 --> 00:28:29,511
Mirage, <i>Big</i> is just a movie.
You'll never be a real boy."

363
00:28:29,546 --> 00:28:32,250
But that was fun, man.
You're fun, dude.

364
00:28:32,285 --> 00:28:35,825
Oh, right. This is probably
a lot for you, huh?

365
00:28:37,895 --> 00:28:40,962
Back up! Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's with the aggression?

366
00:28:40,997 --> 00:28:43,063
I thought after the car chase, we were boys.

367
00:28:43,098 --> 00:28:45,395
Are you gonna hit me?
Maybe.

368
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:48,662
It's like that?

369
00:28:51,634 --> 00:28:53,766
Hmm.
Tough guy.

370
00:28:53,801 --> 00:28:56,604
I like that.
I like it a lot.

371
00:28:56,639 --> 00:28:58,375
What are you?

372
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,410
Some sort of possessed car or something?

373
00:29:00,445 --> 00:29:02,918
Nah.
That's not real, man.

374
00:29:02,953 --> 00:29:04,018
I'm an alien.

375
00:29:04,053 --> 00:29:06,053
Like... Like E.T.?

376
00:29:06,088 --> 00:29:08,451
E.T.?
The little ugly guy in the basket?

377
00:29:08,486 --> 00:29:11,091
Look at this face!
The name's Mirage.

378
00:29:13,524 --> 00:29:15,491
Come on. Give me a little,
give me a little.

379
00:29:15,526 --> 00:29:17,130
Give me a little.
Give a little tap.

380
00:29:17,165 --> 00:29:18,461
Give me a little tap.

381
00:29:18,496 --> 00:29:20,463
There you go.
Now we're friends!

382
00:29:20,498 --> 00:29:23,466
Oh, great. The gang's here.

383
00:29:23,501 --> 00:29:26,568
There are more like you?
Like me? Nah.

384
00:29:26,603 --> 00:29:28,273
But be cool so they don't crush you.

385
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,671
What? Yeah, I'd put that
pipe down if I were you.

386
00:29:59,273 --> 00:30:02,736
<i>Well, well,
who have we got here?</i>

387
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:08,808
Mirage, what have you done?

388
00:30:10,185 --> 00:30:12,218
You brought a human here?

389
00:30:12,253 --> 00:30:14,891
Optimus!
Hey! Looking good, man!

390
00:30:14,926 --> 00:30:16,486
Wait a second.
Are those new rims?

391
00:30:16,521 --> 00:30:18,620
You were told to stay hidden.

392
00:30:18,655 --> 00:30:20,897
Right, right.
Crazy coincidence.

393
00:30:20,932 --> 00:30:22,998
When you called,
all Optimus-like...

394
00:30:23,033 --> 00:30:25,198
"Autobots, roll out!"...

395
00:30:25,233 --> 00:30:27,079
...this guy was already in the car.

396
00:30:27,103 --> 00:30:29,301
But he's cool, so it's cool. Cool?

397
00:30:29,336 --> 00:30:30,863
Not cool.

398
00:30:34,242 --> 00:30:36,209
Who are you, human?

399
00:30:36,244 --> 00:30:38,277
I'm nobody.
I ain't even seen nothing.

400
00:30:38,312 --> 00:30:40,147
I'm not even seeing anything right now.

401
00:30:40,182 --> 00:30:41,808
Arcee.

402
00:30:45,418 --> 00:30:47,616
Private Noah Diaz, US Army.

403
00:30:47,651 --> 00:30:50,586
Multiple commendations.
A wizard with electronics.

404
00:30:50,621 --> 00:30:52,456
Huh.
He's a soldier.

405
00:30:52,491 --> 00:30:54,964
He does not look like a soldier.

406
00:30:54,999 --> 00:30:59,067
I mean, you looking pretty rough yourself.

407
00:30:59,102 --> 00:31:00,827
Sorry, sir.

408
00:31:00,862 --> 00:31:03,698
I will deal with your mistake later.

409
00:31:06,439 --> 00:31:10,837
Okay, the energy surge we felt
was in the 4,000 yottahertz range,

410
00:31:10,872 --> 00:31:12,806
which is undetectable to humans.

411
00:31:12,841 --> 00:31:16,051
I've reconstructed the source
from the energy echoes.

412
00:31:16,086 --> 00:31:19,615
I cannot believe it.
It exists and it is here.

413
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,617
<i>What the hell am I looking at?</i>

414
00:31:21,652 --> 00:31:23,256
The Transwarp Key.

415
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:26,325
It was thought to be lost
thousands of years ago.

416
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,593
<i>It was once used
to open space-time portals</i>

417
00:31:30,628 --> 00:31:34,102
<i>to Energon-rich planets
throughout the universe.</i>

418
00:31:34,137 --> 00:31:36,434
You mean Energon-rich planets like...

419
00:31:36,469 --> 00:31:38,040
Cybertron.

420
00:31:38,075 --> 00:31:40,977
After seven long years stranded on Earth,

421
00:31:41,012 --> 00:31:43,078
we've finally found a way home.

422
00:31:43,113 --> 00:31:45,014
Wait till I catch you, Reek.

423
00:31:45,049 --> 00:31:48,248
Okay, so where is this t-tran, t-trun...

424
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:49,645
Transwarp Key?
Thank you.

425
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,515
It's in the new museum on Ellis Island.

426
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:54,683
<i>Let's blow it up
and get the hell out of Dodge!</i>

427
00:31:54,718 --> 00:31:57,851
No, we can't just go in
blasting and steal it, Bee.

428
00:31:57,886 --> 00:31:59,556
The humans will hunt us down.

429
00:31:59,591 --> 00:32:02,130
What we need is a quiet way in.

430
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:09,071
Ooh, how about him?

431
00:32:09,106 --> 00:32:11,304
- No.
- What? Come on, man.

432
00:32:11,339 --> 00:32:13,900
He could slip in right through
one of them little doors,

433
00:32:13,935 --> 00:32:16,540
grab the key,
leave a nice IOU and peace out.

434
00:32:16,575 --> 00:32:19,147
He's perfect.
What?

435
00:32:19,182 --> 00:32:21,611
No, it is a bad idea.

436
00:32:21,646 --> 00:32:23,745
I agree with Big Man.

437
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:26,880
So, it's been real, y'all.
But...

438
00:32:26,915 --> 00:32:28,816
Uh, time-out.
Mirage.

439
00:32:28,851 --> 00:32:31,852
I know. I know. Just relax.
Let me just talk to my guy real quick.

440
00:32:31,887 --> 00:32:35,427
Yo, don't leave me with these
tight-asses, bro. We make a great team.

441
00:32:35,462 --> 00:32:37,363
This is a waste of time.

442
00:32:37,398 --> 00:32:40,036
Look, I'm not breaking into a
museum for some space robots.

443
00:32:40,071 --> 00:32:42,038
But what about for friendship?

444
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:45,503
Uh, uh...
Or, or, or

445
00:32:45,538 --> 00:32:47,934
what about for cash?

446
00:32:47,969 --> 00:32:51,872
Uh-huh. You help us get this key,
so we can get off this rock--

447
00:32:51,907 --> 00:32:54,215
No offense.
Love the neighborhood and all.

448
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:56,613
And then I let you sell me.

449
00:32:56,648 --> 00:32:58,714
Lambo?

450
00:32:59,684 --> 00:33:00,684
Ferrari?

451
00:33:01,455 --> 00:33:02,487
Indy?

452
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,788
Look, you get paid and then I'll split.

453
00:33:06,823 --> 00:33:08,856
So all I gotta do is walk in and out?

454
00:33:08,891 --> 00:33:11,331
All you gotta do.
We'll take care of the rest.

455
00:33:11,366 --> 00:33:14,136
Cross my spark and hope to die.

456
00:33:14,171 --> 00:33:16,501
Wow! That was corny when I said it out loud.

457
00:33:18,406 --> 00:33:21,539
What about the big man?
Optimal, or whatever.

458
00:33:21,574 --> 00:33:23,805
You let me worry about him.

459
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,872
Cool?

460
00:33:26,843 --> 00:33:29,613
Ah! Got him!
He's in, baby! Whoo!

461
00:33:56,213 --> 00:33:58,477
Y'all are robots that transform into cars,

462
00:33:58,512 --> 00:34:00,611
even though you're from way out in space.

463
00:34:00,646 --> 00:34:03,383
But now there's this key that
opens a portal back to your home?

464
00:34:03,418 --> 00:34:06,551
Oh, and you know this because
there's a beacon light in the sky

465
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,487
that I can't see because I'm human.

466
00:34:08,522 --> 00:34:11,050
You say that like it's weird.
It's super weird.

467
00:34:11,085 --> 00:34:13,921
You know what's weird?
Marky Mark is leaving the Funky Bunch!

468
00:34:13,956 --> 00:34:17,529
I heard he's just gonna pursue acting now.
That's crazy! What?

469
00:34:17,564 --> 00:34:19,432
- How does that...
- What a world.

470
00:34:19,467 --> 00:34:20,829
Whatever, man.

471
00:34:20,864 --> 00:34:22,765
I'm just trying to collect this money

472
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,284
and get your angry-ass boss off
of Earth before he blows a gasket.

473
00:34:25,308 --> 00:34:27,033
Don't take it personal.

474
00:34:27,068 --> 00:34:28,870
He just misses home.

475
00:34:28,905 --> 00:34:32,379
And I think he blames himself
for us getting stuck here.

476
00:34:32,414 --> 00:34:34,579
Earth was supposed to be a pit stop, you know,

477
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:38,451
a place for us to regroup
and rejoin the war back home.

478
00:34:38,486 --> 00:34:41,047
Prime feels like it's his fault
we've been stranded here,

479
00:34:41,082 --> 00:34:43,291
like he has to fix it all on his own.

480
00:34:43,326 --> 00:34:46,162
<i>All right, team, heads up.
There's security up ahead.</i>

481
00:34:46,197 --> 00:34:47,493
Nice!

482
00:34:47,528 --> 00:34:48,956
This is gonna be fun, man.

483
00:34:48,991 --> 00:34:51,167
No, no, no. No, bro.
You need to switch it up.

484
00:34:51,202 --> 00:34:54,467
You need to turn into a helicopter
or a speedboat or something.

485
00:34:54,502 --> 00:34:56,799
I got something way better than that.

486
00:35:10,452 --> 00:35:11,484
Good call.

487
00:35:14,324 --> 00:35:16,456
I do not like this plan.

488
00:35:16,491 --> 00:35:19,558
Yeah, Mirage isn't
really known for being quiet.

489
00:35:19,593 --> 00:35:21,527
At least Mirage is one of us.

490
00:35:21,562 --> 00:35:24,057
We should not be relying on a human.

491
00:35:24,092 --> 00:35:25,366
<i>They are my friends.</i>

492
00:35:25,401 --> 00:35:27,632
I know one was good to you, Bee,

493
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,535
but this is not our world.

494
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:32,505
The humans will always protect what is theirs.

495
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:35,475
We can only trust our own kind.

496
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:37,807
<i>You can't handle the truth!</i>

497
00:35:37,842 --> 00:35:41,481
I do not want you going to
that drive-in theater anymore.

498
00:36:26,825 --> 00:36:29,265
Nightbird, search the island.

499
00:36:30,367 --> 00:36:34,699
Finally, the hunt draws to a close.

500
00:37:01,365 --> 00:37:02,397
Hello?

501
00:37:19,306 --> 00:37:20,910
Fudge.

502
00:37:20,945 --> 00:37:21,977
Oh.

503
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:23,880
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

504
00:37:28,051 --> 00:37:29,424
Hey, are you okay?
Back up!

505
00:37:29,459 --> 00:37:31,459
Yo, are you okay?
Back up! Back up! Back up!

506
00:37:31,494 --> 00:37:33,054
I didn't think anyone was in here.

507
00:37:36,323 --> 00:37:37,531
That's it.

508
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:43,438
Who are you?
Hmm?

509
00:37:43,473 --> 00:37:44,769
I'm, uh...

510
00:37:45,508 --> 00:37:46,573
the janitor.

511
00:37:48,203 --> 00:37:50,379
Security!

512
00:37:50,414 --> 00:37:53,239
No, no, no! You don't have to do that!
It's not what it looks like.

513
00:37:53,274 --> 00:37:56,308
It looks like you're trying
to steal museum property.

514
00:37:56,343 --> 00:37:58,211
Okay, it's a little what it looks like.

515
00:37:59,522 --> 00:38:01,456
Oh, shit.

516
00:38:01,491 --> 00:38:04,591
Hey, hey! Hey, hey, yo, yo!
It doesn't belong to you anyway.

517
00:38:04,626 --> 00:38:07,660
- No, no, no!
- Just stop! Just...

518
00:38:07,695 --> 00:38:10,498
Hey, hey! Relax, relax,
and let me explain.

519
00:38:12,293 --> 00:38:13,468
It belongs to...

520
00:38:15,637 --> 00:38:16,933
...to these...

521
00:38:18,937 --> 00:38:23,511
these giant robots from space.

522
00:38:24,173 --> 00:38:25,447
Really?

523
00:38:25,482 --> 00:38:26,976
Look, I'm gonna need that.

524
00:38:29,046 --> 00:38:30,452
Damn!

525
00:38:30,487 --> 00:38:32,311
- Damn!
- Hey!

526
00:38:32,346 --> 00:38:34,852
Hey, hey, hey!
What's going on here? Don't move.

527
00:38:34,887 --> 00:38:37,151
Man, it's about time you showed up!

528
00:38:44,127 --> 00:38:45,566
The key.

529
00:39:08,789 --> 00:39:12,494
- You were telling the truth.
- Yeah.

530
00:39:12,529 --> 00:39:14,793
But those ones aren't with me.

531
00:39:18,601 --> 00:39:25,474
Rip the flesh from
their bones and bring me the key.

532
00:39:30,404 --> 00:39:31,447
It's yours.

533
00:39:42,218 --> 00:39:43,921
Guys, we got company!

534
00:39:51,392 --> 00:39:54,063
Autobots, protect the key!

535
00:39:56,265 --> 00:39:57,297
Catch!

536
00:40:07,782 --> 00:40:09,815
<i>Not so fast!</i>

537
00:40:14,415 --> 00:40:17,658
Oh, they're flying now?
Who the hell are these guys?

538
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:30,000
Impossible!

539
00:40:30,035 --> 00:40:32,904
I enjoy that look of confusion

540
00:40:32,939 --> 00:40:36,974
when an inferior being meets a higher power.

541
00:40:46,656 --> 00:40:48,722
What the hell are those things?

542
00:40:49,758 --> 00:40:50,988
Are you okay?

543
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:57,159
Hey! Stop following me!
I'm not following you!

544
00:40:57,194 --> 00:40:59,161
I'm just escaping in the same direction.

545
00:42:13,534 --> 00:42:14,676
Um...

546
00:42:18,715 --> 00:42:19,813
Run!

547
00:42:20,574 --> 00:42:22,376
Go, go!

548
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:34,322
Run!

549
00:42:34,357 --> 00:42:36,159
Go, go, go, go, go!

550
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,103
Watch out!

551
00:42:46,567 --> 00:42:48,039
Thanks.

552
00:42:54,608 --> 00:42:57,114
Scourge, I have eyes on the key.

553
00:42:58,887 --> 00:43:01,349
Prime, I don't think
we can hold these guys...

554
00:43:01,384 --> 00:43:03,285
Oh, no!

555
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,693
My God!
Put me down!

556
00:43:07,423 --> 00:43:10,094
Whoa, that was so scary.

557
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:12,096
Oh, cool.
You're still alive.

558
00:43:14,595 --> 00:43:15,638
Get the key!

559
00:43:17,169 --> 00:43:18,399
Noah, get out of here!

560
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,941
Get off me!
I hate spiders!

561
00:43:24,209 --> 00:43:27,177
Go, go, go!
Don't die, don't die, don't die, don't die!

562
00:43:31,018 --> 00:43:32,820
Go! Get out of here!

563
00:43:39,191 --> 00:43:42,357
Uh-uh-uh.
Leaving so soon?

564
00:43:42,392 --> 00:43:44,964
Yo! Look out!

565
00:43:49,102 --> 00:43:50,629
The key!

566
00:43:55,878 --> 00:43:58,813
Enough of these games.
I'll get it myself.

567
00:43:58,848 --> 00:44:00,716
<i>Not on my watch.</i>

568
00:44:28,735 --> 00:44:31,780
Aw, don't be frightened, humans.

569
00:44:31,815 --> 00:44:35,047
This'll all be over soon.

570
00:44:38,052 --> 00:44:40,151
And you call yourself a Prime.

571
00:44:40,186 --> 00:44:43,187
Primus would be ashamed.

572
00:44:56,730 --> 00:45:00,534
I'm tired of little things getting in my way.

573
00:45:01,207 --> 00:45:02,207
Bee!

574
00:45:04,012 --> 00:45:05,704
<i>O Captain!
My Captain!</i>

575
00:45:06,278 --> 00:45:07,376
No!

576
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:27,726
Bee.

577
00:45:33,569 --> 00:45:36,438
Now to add a Prime to my collection.

578
00:45:48,386 --> 00:45:50,386
Maximals.

579
00:45:50,421 --> 00:45:53,455
Good.
Maybe we'll get a real fight.

580
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:56,722
No.
We got what we came for.

581
00:46:01,597 --> 00:46:03,663
No.

582
00:46:04,501 --> 00:46:07,942
This cannot be.

583
00:46:25,126 --> 00:46:27,588
We must go now.
Come with me.

584
00:46:51,845 --> 00:46:56,122
This is my fault.
It should've been me.

585
00:46:57,323 --> 00:46:59,994
I'm sorry for your loss.

586
00:47:00,029 --> 00:47:03,096
No offense, lady,
but who are you again?

587
00:47:03,131 --> 00:47:06,528
My name is Airazor.

588
00:47:06,563 --> 00:47:08,464
I am a Maximal.

589
00:47:08,499 --> 00:47:11,368
A warrior from both your past and future.

590
00:47:11,403 --> 00:47:14,635
Oh, right. That--
That tracks. Yeah.

591
00:47:14,670 --> 00:47:18,672
We fled our home planet
on the eve of its destruction.

592
00:47:18,707 --> 00:47:22,346
We sought refuge and hid here on Earth.

593
00:47:22,381 --> 00:47:24,711
Right. So you're a Maximal.
Y'all are Autobots.

594
00:47:24,746 --> 00:47:26,878
What was those things
that attacked us earlier?

595
00:47:26,913 --> 00:47:30,750
Terrorcons.
Servants of a dark, hungry god

596
00:47:30,785 --> 00:47:33,929
who feeds on entire worlds
to sustain himself.

597
00:47:33,964 --> 00:47:36,063
Unicron.

598
00:47:36,098 --> 00:47:39,759
So you're saying this thing
Unicron eats planets to survive?

599
00:47:39,794 --> 00:47:44,170
Yes. And he imbues
his servants, like Scourge,

600
00:47:44,205 --> 00:47:49,406
<i>with dark energy,
which makes him all but invincible.</i>

601
00:47:49,441 --> 00:47:52,541
<i>He is entirely beholden to Unicron.</i>

602
00:47:52,576 --> 00:47:56,985
<i>Through his power,
he possesses Scourge's soul.</i>

603
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:59,845
Awaken, my dark master.

604
00:48:17,766 --> 00:48:20,206
Rise.

605
00:48:20,241 --> 00:48:23,176
My hunger is killing me.

606
00:48:23,211 --> 00:48:24,573
What have you found?

607
00:48:24,608 --> 00:48:26,740
Salvation.

608
00:48:26,775 --> 00:48:31,646
The galaxy will once again
be yours to feast on, my master.

609
00:48:32,979 --> 00:48:35,683
I should've gotten the key myself.

610
00:48:35,718 --> 00:48:38,257
I should've known better
than to rely on humans.

611
00:48:38,292 --> 00:48:40,853
Yo, hold up.
What, you blaming me?

612
00:48:40,888 --> 00:48:44,560
After you conveniently left out the
part about a planet-eating monster?

613
00:48:44,595 --> 00:48:46,958
Because of you,
Unicron will now use the key

614
00:48:46,993 --> 00:48:49,598
to consume every planet in the universe!

615
00:48:49,633 --> 00:48:51,699
Including my home world.

616
00:48:51,734 --> 00:48:55,373
He doesn't have the key.
At least not all of it.

617
00:48:55,408 --> 00:48:59,179
You fool!

618
00:48:59,214 --> 00:49:02,545
This is only half the key.
Please!

619
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:06,681
The Maximals...
They must have split it.

620
00:49:06,716 --> 00:49:08,617
Excuses!

621
00:49:08,652 --> 00:49:11,587
Complete the key,
or else you will wish you had died

622
00:49:11,622 --> 00:49:13,853
<i>with the rest of your planet.</i>

623
00:49:13,888 --> 00:49:17,692
We broke the key into
two pieces for safekeeping,

624
00:49:17,727 --> 00:49:20,464
then splintered and went into hiding.

625
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:23,665
I do not know where the other half is.

626
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:28,043
For all I know,
I am the last of our kind.

627
00:49:28,936 --> 00:49:30,507
It's in Peru.

628
00:49:30,542 --> 00:49:32,003
How you know that?

629
00:49:32,038 --> 00:49:34,082
It's the symbols on the stone.

630
00:49:34,117 --> 00:49:36,843
They were only ever recorded
in one other place in the world.

631
00:49:36,878 --> 00:49:39,780
The Inca Temple of the Sun in Cusco.

632
00:49:39,815 --> 00:49:43,454
It's one of the oldest buildings in
the western hemisphere. I'm-I'm...

633
00:49:43,489 --> 00:49:46,325
I'm guessing that that can't be a coincidence.

634
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:50,197
If you can track those symbols to Peru,
so can the Terrorcons.

635
00:49:50,232 --> 00:49:52,023
We need to get there before they do.

636
00:49:52,058 --> 00:49:57,072
And then kill Scourge and take
his piece to complete the key.

637
00:49:57,107 --> 00:49:58,700
Yo. Hold up. Hold up.

638
00:49:58,735 --> 00:50:00,834
You want to find this other key

639
00:50:00,869 --> 00:50:03,936
and deliver it to the guy
that just kicked your asses.

640
00:50:03,971 --> 00:50:06,213
The Transwarp Key is our only way home.

641
00:50:06,248 --> 00:50:09,249
If this dude gets ahold of that thing,
it's game over for Earth!

642
00:50:09,284 --> 00:50:11,812
Our families, everybody!

643
00:50:15,521 --> 00:50:16,553
I'm going.

644
00:50:16,588 --> 00:50:18,522
Out of the question.

645
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:22,229
No offense, but I'm not
trusting my home to a guy

646
00:50:22,264 --> 00:50:23,758
who couldn't even protect his.

647
00:50:25,234 --> 00:50:28,026
This is my planet.
I'm going.

648
00:50:28,061 --> 00:50:29,467
What about you?

649
00:50:32,604 --> 00:50:35,077
Me?
What is your name?

650
00:50:36,102 --> 00:50:37,178
Elena.

651
00:50:37,213 --> 00:50:38,806
Elena,

652
00:50:38,841 --> 00:50:40,973
will you lead us to this temple?

653
00:50:44,154 --> 00:50:46,418
Chance to stop the end of the world.

654
00:50:46,453 --> 00:50:48,222
Actually,

655
00:50:48,257 --> 00:50:50,620
you'll be saving two worlds.

656
00:50:58,091 --> 00:50:59,101
Yeah.

657
00:51:09,245 --> 00:51:11,707
<i>Yo, is that you, Sonic?</i>

658
00:51:14,382 --> 00:51:15,975
What are you doing up, Tails?

659
00:51:16,879 --> 00:51:18,351
<i>I can't sleep.</i>

660
00:51:28,759 --> 00:51:29,791
This too hot?

661
00:51:31,234 --> 00:51:32,893
You playing that game too much.

662
00:51:32,928 --> 00:51:35,093
Give it a rest,
so your hand can take a break.

663
00:51:35,128 --> 00:51:36,930
I'm gonna beat it.

664
00:51:39,209 --> 00:51:40,604
My money's on you, bro.

665
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:42,342
We don't quit.

666
00:51:42,377 --> 00:51:44,146
Come on, get some sleep, all right?

667
00:51:52,013 --> 00:51:54,222
Yo, listen, um,

668
00:51:54,257 --> 00:51:56,521
I gotta--
I gotta head out for a while.

669
00:51:56,556 --> 00:51:58,787
And I don't know when I'm gonna be back.

670
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:00,492
Why?

671
00:52:02,331 --> 00:52:05,365
Oh, shit.

672
00:52:10,471 --> 00:52:12,031
- What the...
- No, no, no!

673
00:52:12,066 --> 00:52:14,308
No! Stop, please!
Turn off! Turn off!

674
00:52:14,343 --> 00:52:16,772
Yo, won't you--
I told you to sit tight.

675
00:52:16,807 --> 00:52:18,576
Stop it. I can't turn it off.
I'm sorry.

676
00:52:18,611 --> 00:52:19,709
Is that a robot?

677
00:52:19,744 --> 00:52:21,645
No, no, no.
Go-- Go back to bed.

678
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,714
Yo, shut it off! I think your bad
hot-wiring messed up my lights.

679
00:52:24,749 --> 00:52:26,518
I got the bat.
Yo, chill. Give me that.

680
00:52:26,553 --> 00:52:29,048
- Did he say "bat"?
- You're gonna wake up Ma!

681
00:52:34,528 --> 00:52:36,561
I know you're a robot.

682
00:52:37,894 --> 00:52:39,058
Kris?

683
00:52:46,408 --> 00:52:48,837
Yo! You scratched my paint!

684
00:52:50,005 --> 00:52:51,675
What are you doing?

685
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:53,479
Man, they didn't treat E.T. like this.

686
00:52:53,514 --> 00:52:55,074
You know this thing?
Yeah.

687
00:52:55,109 --> 00:52:57,681
We're just work friends.

688
00:52:57,716 --> 00:53:00,684
"Work friends"?
You've been inside me.

689
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:04,523
Look, that thing I told you I have to go do?

690
00:53:04,558 --> 00:53:06,019
It's for him and his crew.

691
00:53:06,054 --> 00:53:07,734
We're trying to stop the end of the world.

692
00:53:07,759 --> 00:53:08,989
The world's ending?

693
00:53:09,024 --> 00:53:11,497
No!
Maybe. Sixty-forty.

694
00:53:11,532 --> 00:53:14,027
You know I'm not gonna let that happen.

695
00:53:14,062 --> 00:53:15,732
But that's why I have to leave.

696
00:53:19,375 --> 00:53:20,737
I'll go get my things.

697
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,575
Tough kid.

698
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:26,171
What? No. Whoa, whoa.
Hold up. Hold up. You're not coming.

699
00:53:26,206 --> 00:53:30,384
Why? You need someone to watch your back.
It's too dangerous, Kris.

700
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:34,421
And I need you to stay here
and take care of Mom.

701
00:53:36,755 --> 00:53:38,491
'Cause you might not come back.

702
00:53:52,298 --> 00:53:53,803
Hey, robot.

703
00:53:54,806 --> 00:53:57,444
Me?
'Sup?

704
00:53:57,479 --> 00:54:01,206
Watch out for my brother.
Okay?

705
00:54:01,241 --> 00:54:03,241
You got it, little man.

706
00:54:03,276 --> 00:54:05,210
Nah, I'm serious.

707
00:54:05,245 --> 00:54:07,850
If he gets hurt,
I'm coming after you.

708
00:54:09,722 --> 00:54:12,954
Don't worry.
I got Noah's back. I promise.

709
00:54:12,989 --> 00:54:14,252
Mm-hmm.

710
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,124
Home team?

711
00:54:21,096 --> 00:54:22,128
Home team.

712
00:54:26,101 --> 00:54:28,134
Kid's got heart.

713
00:54:28,169 --> 00:54:30,136
<i>Cojones muy grande.</i>

714
00:54:41,182 --> 00:54:44,051
Wu-Tang is in the building, baby!

715
00:54:44,086 --> 00:54:46,493
Way to be incognito.

716
00:54:46,528 --> 00:54:49,320
Aw, come on, Prime.
Smile a little bit.

717
00:54:49,355 --> 00:54:51,498
It won't hurt.
Let me see that underbite.

718
00:54:51,533 --> 00:54:54,666
All right. So what kind
of jet we taking to Peru?

719
00:54:54,701 --> 00:54:56,503
Or is it a plane?
Either one's fine.

720
00:54:56,538 --> 00:54:59,231
I just need first class, okay?
'Cause I got long-ass legs.

721
00:54:59,266 --> 00:55:01,167
Uh, well, he is a plane.

722
00:55:01,202 --> 00:55:02,938
No. No, no. Don't...

723
00:55:02,973 --> 00:55:04,775
Don't tell me we're flying on...

724
00:55:04,810 --> 00:55:06,040
Oh, no.

725
00:55:24,632 --> 00:55:28,931
My lads! I am Stratosphere,
lord of the skies!

726
00:55:36,402 --> 00:55:37,907
Yeah, I'm walking to Peru.

727
00:55:46,984 --> 00:55:48,016
Ooh.

728
00:55:49,283 --> 00:55:50,491
Oh, my gosh.

729
00:55:59,359 --> 00:56:00,897
Sorry.

730
00:56:00,932 --> 00:56:04,230
I sing when I get nervous.
It usually calms me down.

731
00:56:04,265 --> 00:56:05,704
First time flying?

732
00:56:05,739 --> 00:56:08,201
Man, this is my first time
leaving New York.

733
00:56:09,578 --> 00:56:12,040
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.

734
00:56:13,109 --> 00:56:14,548
So the Bronx, huh?

735
00:56:14,583 --> 00:56:16,682
Brooklyn, all right?

736
00:56:16,717 --> 00:56:18,376
East New York all day.

737
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,411
I'm from Bushwick.

738
00:56:20,446 --> 00:56:22,886
Really?
Mm-hmm.

739
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:25,526
Um, me and my dad,
we used to go to this--

740
00:56:25,561 --> 00:56:27,957
this pizza spot down
on Knickerbocker and Greene.

741
00:56:27,992 --> 00:56:30,828
Tony's Pizza? Wow.

742
00:56:35,164 --> 00:56:37,571
So, uh, tell me about him, your pops.

743
00:56:37,606 --> 00:56:38,902
What-- What was he like?

744
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:42,807
He was a--
He was a cabbie for 40 years.

745
00:56:42,842 --> 00:56:45,579
Smartest guy you ever met.

746
00:56:45,614 --> 00:56:47,911
He could talk to you about anything.

747
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:50,584
History, science, cricket.

748
00:56:50,619 --> 00:56:52,311
Cricket?

749
00:56:53,556 --> 00:56:55,754
And he ain't never even go to college either.

750
00:56:55,789 --> 00:56:57,789
He used to always say,

751
00:56:57,824 --> 00:57:01,452
"If you keep your eyes
and your ears open,

752
00:57:01,487 --> 00:57:03,795
life will show you
everything you need to know."

753
00:57:06,294 --> 00:57:08,602
So that's why you said yes to all of this.

754
00:57:09,638 --> 00:57:12,100
I figured if he is somewhere watching,

755
00:57:12,135 --> 00:57:15,774
then seeing his daughter
do something crazy like this

756
00:57:16,645 --> 00:57:18,513
would definitely make him proud.

757
00:57:28,624 --> 00:57:31,152
You really think this key thing's in Peru?

758
00:57:31,187 --> 00:57:32,593
I-- I think so.

759
00:57:32,628 --> 00:57:34,155
The evidence lines up.

760
00:57:36,126 --> 00:57:39,259
Well, if it is,
and we get our hands on it,

761
00:57:39,294 --> 00:57:40,733
then we gotta destroy it.

762
00:57:40,768 --> 00:57:42,834
What?

763
00:57:42,869 --> 00:57:45,969
They can't unite the key without both pieces.

764
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:49,544
No key, no Unicron,
no Earth getting eaten.

765
00:57:53,242 --> 00:57:55,209
Yeah, but then they can't get home.

766
00:57:56,718 --> 00:57:58,245
We gotta think about us.

767
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:04,515
Look, all you gotta do is find it.

768
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:06,385
And I'll take care of the rest.

769
00:58:10,765 --> 00:58:14,800
Do you think an Energon
infusion could bring him back?

770
00:58:14,835 --> 00:58:15,867
Perhaps.

771
00:58:16,903 --> 00:58:19,464
If we could get him back to Cybertron.

772
00:58:21,303 --> 00:58:24,502
I never should have taken us
so far from home.

773
00:59:06,656 --> 00:59:09,151
Wow! Wheeljack needs to fix
that power steering.

774
00:59:11,991 --> 00:59:13,419
Sorry I'm late.

775
00:59:13,454 --> 00:59:15,322
I was taking in a harmonious moment

776
00:59:15,357 --> 00:59:19,095
between a serene butterfly
and an unruffled caterpillar.

777
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:20,866
Such tranquility.

778
00:59:20,901 --> 00:59:24,397
Yo-ho-ho.
<i>Oye, papo,</i> where you from? Cybertron.

779
00:59:24,432 --> 00:59:27,004
So where'd you get that accent?
Accent? What accent?

780
00:59:27,039 --> 00:59:29,369
You know what I'm saying?
I'm just saying it's cool.

781
00:59:29,404 --> 00:59:31,877
I was about to be like,
<i>"¿Yo, mira, papi, de dónde eres?"</i>

782
00:59:31,912 --> 00:59:35,540
<i>Pero</i> I didn't want to assume
that you speak Spanish too,

783
00:59:35,575 --> 00:59:36,981
because then... Right?

784
00:59:37,016 --> 00:59:39,852
Mmm.
A little racist, <i>hermano.</i>

785
00:59:39,887 --> 00:59:41,920
I'm not trying to be,
you know... Yo.

786
00:59:41,955 --> 00:59:45,187
But anyway... The mission.
Follow me.

787
00:59:45,222 --> 00:59:47,255
But he's a robot, like, so,

788
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:49,631
how's that racist?

789
00:59:53,362 --> 00:59:55,362
Okay, you guys,
check this out.

790
00:59:55,397 --> 00:59:58,530
The coordinates you gave me
correspond to an old church.

791
00:59:58,565 --> 00:59:59,630
Take a look.

792
01:00:02,206 --> 01:00:05,812
That's Santo Domingo.
The Spanish built it on top of an old Inca temple.

793
01:00:05,847 --> 01:00:09,783
<i>Correcto.</i> I picked up some residual
energy readings around the courtyard,

794
01:00:09,818 --> 01:00:12,412
so I'm guessing the key's somewhere close by.

795
01:00:12,447 --> 01:00:14,722
But we may have some trouble getting there.

796
01:00:14,757 --> 01:00:16,284
Inti Raymi.

797
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:19,023
It's a festival that shuts down the whole city.

798
01:00:19,058 --> 01:00:21,487
- Guess it's - a night mission then.
- No.

799
01:00:21,522 --> 01:00:23,830
Scourge could already be here.

800
01:00:23,865 --> 01:00:27,130
We must retrieve the other half before he does.

801
01:00:29,332 --> 01:00:31,772
Me and Elena will do it.
Hmm?

802
01:00:31,807 --> 01:00:33,972
Y'all would never make it two blocks.

803
01:00:34,007 --> 01:00:36,612
There's human security all around the church.
You'll never get through.

804
01:00:36,636 --> 01:00:39,505
Then we'll have to take
a play out of your book.

805
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:41,782
We'll hide in plain sight.

806
01:00:41,817 --> 01:00:44,114
We'll blend in with the parade.

807
01:00:44,149 --> 01:00:47,084
It is not a bad idea.

808
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:49,955
We will keep an eye out for the Terrorcons.

809
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:53,651
On first sign of trouble,
we are going in.

810
01:00:53,686 --> 01:00:55,323
Yo, Noah, think fast.

811
01:01:01,397 --> 01:01:03,661
And if you need help,
just holler.

812
01:01:19,184 --> 01:01:21,712
I am in position.

813
01:01:21,747 --> 01:01:23,681
All right, coast is clear.

814
01:01:23,716 --> 01:01:26,354
<i>Noah, Elena, it's go time.</i>

815
01:01:27,159 --> 01:01:29,357
<i>Blend in.
Act natural.</i>

816
01:02:02,128 --> 01:02:05,063
Autobots must be using their new pets

817
01:02:05,098 --> 01:02:07,197
to reach the temple.

818
01:02:07,232 --> 01:02:09,496
Lovely.

819
01:02:09,531 --> 01:02:12,268
They're doing our work for us.

820
01:02:12,303 --> 01:02:14,468
Go fetch.

821
01:02:19,244 --> 01:02:21,277
The key's gotta be in here somewhere.

822
01:02:22,049 --> 01:02:23,081
Yeah.

823
01:02:36,965 --> 01:02:39,625
That stonework is 17th century.

824
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:42,760
What we're looking for is something

825
01:02:43,598 --> 01:02:46,434
much, much older.

826
01:02:54,807 --> 01:02:57,445
What is it?
It's the same insignia on Airazor.

827
01:02:58,382 --> 01:03:00,184
But it's not lined up right.

828
01:03:02,892 --> 01:03:04,617
Wait, you see that?

829
01:03:04,652 --> 01:03:09,655
I think there's something under here.

830
01:03:13,430 --> 01:03:14,935
There's another one.

831
01:03:19,304 --> 01:03:20,765
There is.

832
01:03:29,875 --> 01:03:30,984
Now what?

833
01:03:32,383 --> 01:03:34,680
I thought it would've--

834
01:03:48,168 --> 01:03:50,465
That's some
Indiana Jones-type shit.

835
01:03:51,897 --> 01:03:53,567
You sure about this?

836
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,272
No.

837
01:04:04,118 --> 01:04:06,349
Any sign of Scourge?

838
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:07,680
Nope, all clear here.

839
01:04:07,715 --> 01:04:09,484
Uh, yeah.

840
01:04:09,519 --> 01:04:11,035
It's just groupies over here.

841
01:04:11,059 --> 01:04:13,389
Stay on task, Mirage.

842
01:04:13,424 --> 01:04:16,293
Prime, you gotta learn how to relax, my man.

843
01:04:23,896 --> 01:04:24,939
Ah.

844
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:42,957
You know, we must be the first
people to walk here in half a millennium.

845
01:04:44,752 --> 01:04:47,225
<i>Yo, Sonic. You dead yet?</i>

846
01:04:48,888 --> 01:04:49,997
No.

847
01:04:50,923 --> 01:04:53,033
Wait, did you just call me Sonic?

848
01:04:53,068 --> 01:04:54,463
I think that's a temple.

849
01:05:01,142 --> 01:05:03,208
What are we looking for?

850
01:05:03,243 --> 01:05:05,276
You see the symbols on that temple?

851
01:05:05,311 --> 01:05:07,179
They match the ones in the courtyard.

852
01:05:07,214 --> 01:05:08,642
I think it's up there.

853
01:05:20,425 --> 01:05:22,755
I think we found what we came here for.

854
01:05:25,265 --> 01:05:27,133
I always wondered what it would feel like

855
01:05:27,168 --> 01:05:29,861
to be there when artifacts
were actually found.

856
01:05:32,668 --> 01:05:35,273
All right.
Now come on, push.

857
01:05:43,118 --> 01:05:45,250
Are you even pushing?

858
01:05:45,285 --> 01:05:47,417
Yeah, I'm pushing.

859
01:05:58,628 --> 01:06:00,826
Wait, what?
Just-- Just let me think.

860
01:06:00,861 --> 01:06:02,828
Oh, no, no.
Where is it?

861
01:06:02,863 --> 01:06:07,041
Sometimes there's, like, a--
like a false bottom or something.

862
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:11,969
Look.

863
01:06:12,004 --> 01:06:14,906
I think I found something.
You see these symbols?

864
01:06:14,941 --> 01:06:18,217
I've seen markings like this--
the Airazor statue at my museum.

865
01:06:18,252 --> 01:06:20,351
They're new.

866
01:06:20,386 --> 01:06:22,716
They're not on the Transwarp Key.

867
01:06:22,751 --> 01:06:24,388
There's two of them.

868
01:06:33,366 --> 01:06:34,530
Mirage?

869
01:06:38,833 --> 01:06:41,570
Let's keep moving.
Just give me a second.

870
01:06:45,873 --> 01:06:47,345
Run!

871
01:06:54,849 --> 01:06:56,618
Go, go, go, go, go!

872
01:06:56,653 --> 01:06:58,785
Mirage!
We got trouble!

873
01:06:58,820 --> 01:07:01,722
<i>One of those things is down here!
Where are you guys?</i>

874
01:07:01,757 --> 01:07:03,790
Hang tight!
I'm on the way.

875
01:07:06,366 --> 01:07:07,893
<i>The Autobots are moving.</i>

876
01:07:07,928 --> 01:07:10,269
They must have found the key.

877
01:07:21,579 --> 01:07:22,941
Come on!

878
01:07:24,516 --> 01:07:26,076
Airazor, where are the humans?

879
01:07:26,111 --> 01:07:28,881
They're underground,
heading towards the jungle.

880
01:07:46,373 --> 01:07:48,472
Aw, man, they're tailing us!

881
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:00,319
Do something!
What do you want me to do?

882
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:09,955
You had a gun this whole time?

883
01:08:28,140 --> 01:08:30,316
<i>Prime, what the hell are you doing?</i>

884
01:08:30,351 --> 01:08:33,143
I'm going to take back Scourge's key

885
01:08:33,178 --> 01:08:36,487
and then take off his head.

886
01:08:47,995 --> 01:08:50,930
Guys!
I could use a little help!

887
01:08:50,965 --> 01:08:53,031
Did someone call for backup?

888
01:09:01,382 --> 01:09:03,019
- Brake, brake, brake!
- What?

889
01:09:03,043 --> 01:09:05,318
Brake!

890
01:09:12,723 --> 01:09:15,394
Yay!

891
01:09:16,562 --> 01:09:18,595
This is for Bee!

892
01:09:30,543 --> 01:09:32,202
Come here.

893
01:09:32,237 --> 01:09:33,544
Hold on!

894
01:09:53,632 --> 01:09:56,369
I love your fire, Prime.

895
01:09:56,404 --> 01:10:00,197
But you're going to die
on this speck of dust.

896
01:10:00,232 --> 01:10:04,069
I can think of no better place to bury you.

897
01:10:31,901 --> 01:10:34,374
I will end you, Scourge.

898
01:10:36,103 --> 01:10:39,742
That is a promise.

899
01:10:39,777 --> 01:10:41,381
They're getting away.

900
01:10:41,416 --> 01:10:43,174
Not this time.

901
01:10:50,249 --> 01:10:52,425
I hear water.

902
01:10:56,431 --> 01:10:57,826
Where are we?

903
01:11:04,098 --> 01:11:05,130
What was that?

904
01:11:19,311 --> 01:11:21,311
Who are you?

905
01:11:21,346 --> 01:11:23,181
And why are you hunting for the key?

906
01:11:23,216 --> 01:11:25,656
Yo, Donkey Kong!
Stay away from my friends!

907
01:11:25,691 --> 01:11:28,560
Uh, Mirage? Don't worry.
Your boy's got this.

908
01:11:31,158 --> 01:11:33,697
Stranger danger!
Stranger danger!

909
01:11:34,502 --> 01:11:36,370
Hey, hey, hey!

910
01:11:36,405 --> 01:11:37,437
Not so fa--

911
01:11:42,004 --> 01:11:43,102
Ay, ay, ay.

912
01:11:43,137 --> 01:11:45,709
Hey! Over here,
kitty, kitty.

913
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:49,713
Stand down!

914
01:11:51,585 --> 01:11:54,685
I won't ask a second time.

915
01:11:59,318 --> 01:12:01,494
No!
All of you, stop!

916
01:12:04,532 --> 01:12:06,763
Airazor.
Primal.

917
01:12:06,798 --> 01:12:09,832
I thought you were lost.
All of you.

918
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:13,099
The others... Are they...

919
01:12:13,134 --> 01:12:15,706
I am all that is left.

920
01:12:19,206 --> 01:12:22,581
Prime, these are my fellow Maximals.

921
01:12:22,616 --> 01:12:25,012
Rhinox.

922
01:12:25,047 --> 01:12:26,618
Cheetor.

923
01:12:26,653 --> 01:12:28,378
Sorry about scaring you, brother.

924
01:12:28,413 --> 01:12:30,424
- Scared?
- Please.

925
01:12:30,459 --> 01:12:31,986
I'm not scared.

926
01:12:32,021 --> 01:12:33,559
That's just engine oil.

927
01:12:33,594 --> 01:12:38,058
And our leader, Optimus Primal.

928
01:12:38,929 --> 01:12:40,962
Optimus Primal?

929
01:12:40,997 --> 01:12:45,263
Named after you,
the legendary warrior of Cybertron.

930
01:12:45,298 --> 01:12:46,473
It's an honor.

931
01:12:47,938 --> 01:12:51,071
Airazor, I'm happy to see you, old friend.

932
01:12:51,106 --> 01:12:54,239
But bringing others here
was not part of our plan.

933
01:12:54,274 --> 01:12:56,780
I fear you bring dark tidings.

934
01:12:56,815 --> 01:12:59,079
Scourge has come to Earth.

935
01:12:59,114 --> 01:13:00,916
He's found us.

936
01:13:00,951 --> 01:13:03,413
And he has half of the key.

937
01:13:03,448 --> 01:13:06,218
We must find the second
piece before he does.

938
01:13:06,253 --> 01:13:08,121
But it wasn't in the cave.

939
01:13:08,156 --> 01:13:11,190
It was. But we moved it
long ago to keep it safe.

940
01:13:11,225 --> 01:13:13,500
Where is it now?

941
01:13:16,868 --> 01:13:18,131
Come with me.

942
01:13:26,438 --> 01:13:28,372
That doesn't look so good.

943
01:13:28,407 --> 01:13:31,716
When Scourge touches you,
he leaves a mark.

944
01:13:32,477 --> 01:13:34,554
But I'll be all right.

945
01:13:47,492 --> 01:13:49,503
Hey, back there you called me Sonic.

946
01:13:49,538 --> 01:13:51,670
Yeah.
Your little bro's got this thing

947
01:13:51,705 --> 01:13:54,464
about using real names
over the airwaves, so...

948
01:13:54,499 --> 01:13:56,268
Wait, you been talking to Kris?
Uh-huh.

949
01:13:56,303 --> 01:13:59,744
He gave me this to keep tabs on you,

950
01:13:59,779 --> 01:14:01,240
make sure I'm keeping my promise.

951
01:14:01,275 --> 01:14:02,813
Oh, here.

952
01:14:02,848 --> 01:14:04,947
Next time, include warning labels.

953
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:07,884
Nah, go ahead, keep it.

954
01:14:07,919 --> 01:14:09,985
I guess it does look better on me.

955
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:12,625
Just don't ask what part
of my body it came from.

956
01:14:15,454 --> 01:14:17,663
So, who are you?

957
01:14:17,698 --> 01:14:19,797
We Maximals are an advanced race

958
01:14:19,832 --> 01:14:24,065
dedicated to the expansion
of life throughout the universe.

959
01:14:24,100 --> 01:14:27,398
We use the Transwarp Key
to visit young worlds.

960
01:14:27,433 --> 01:14:31,138
The Nazca Lines,
the Temple at Tikal--

961
01:14:31,173 --> 01:14:32,843
That was you guys, right?

962
01:14:32,878 --> 01:14:34,240
Not us.

963
01:14:34,275 --> 01:14:36,781
We cannot claim credit for human ingenuity.

964
01:14:36,816 --> 01:14:40,279
But you had the key.
Why stay on this world?

965
01:14:40,314 --> 01:14:42,820
When Unicron destroyed our world,

966
01:14:42,855 --> 01:14:46,659
we took an oath dedicated
to the preservation of life,

967
01:14:46,694 --> 01:14:48,694
no matter the cost.

968
01:14:48,729 --> 01:14:50,993
And Earth has been a safe refuge.

969
01:15:30,298 --> 01:15:32,606
This is Amaru.

970
01:15:32,641 --> 01:15:35,741
He and his family are the
last descendants of a tribe

971
01:15:35,776 --> 01:15:38,645
that has watched over us
for hundreds of years.

972
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:43,683
When we arrived,
they shared their world with us.

973
01:15:43,718 --> 01:15:46,147
And together we protected its people

974
01:15:46,182 --> 01:15:48,952
and our secret.

975
01:15:55,587 --> 01:15:57,455
You allied with humans.

976
01:15:58,392 --> 01:16:00,062
We did.

977
01:16:01,296 --> 01:16:03,835
If you give us this key,

978
01:16:03,870 --> 01:16:08,004
tomorrow I will light the beacon
and bring Scourge to us.

979
01:16:08,039 --> 01:16:12,503
The Maximals have already sacrificed
one home to protect the universe.

980
01:16:12,538 --> 01:16:14,912
I won't risk losing another.

981
01:16:14,947 --> 01:16:17,618
As a leader, I know you understand.

982
01:16:42,744 --> 01:16:46,405
He is not the Optimus Prime I imagined.

983
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:49,408
Well, he has lost so much.

984
01:16:49,443 --> 01:16:51,410
Many more will perish

985
01:16:51,445 --> 01:16:54,578
if the key falls into the wrong hands.

986
01:16:54,613 --> 01:16:58,384
If you had another chance to save our home,

987
01:16:58,419 --> 01:17:00,188
would you act any differently?

988
01:17:04,392 --> 01:17:07,591
Optimus, come.
I want to show you something.

989
01:17:12,433 --> 01:17:14,675
Your friend will find peace here.

990
01:17:16,371 --> 01:17:19,108
This is raw Energon.

991
01:17:19,143 --> 01:17:21,143
The valley is rich with it.

992
01:17:21,178 --> 01:17:23,640
Could this revive Bee?

993
01:17:23,675 --> 01:17:27,116
I'm sorry,
but in this state, it is inert.

994
01:17:27,151 --> 01:17:29,789
It would take a great power to ignite it.

995
01:17:29,824 --> 01:17:32,726
Greater than anything we have here.

996
01:17:35,324 --> 01:17:38,424
I see that you are surprised
we entrust the key to them.

997
01:17:38,459 --> 01:17:40,360
Yes, I am.

998
01:17:40,395 --> 01:17:43,264
I've been amongst them a long time now.

999
01:17:43,299 --> 01:17:46,531
There is more to them than meets the eye.

1000
01:17:46,566 --> 01:17:48,533
They are worth saving.

1001
01:17:59,546 --> 01:18:00,578
Hmm.

1002
01:18:23,405 --> 01:18:24,943
What if we didn't destroy it?

1003
01:18:27,343 --> 01:18:32,610
Maybe there's another way
to-- to save both our homes.

1004
01:18:32,645 --> 01:18:35,756
Elena, I made a lot of mistakes in my life.

1005
01:18:37,485 --> 01:18:39,056
This is different.

1006
01:18:41,555 --> 01:18:43,291
I can't fail at this.

1007
01:18:44,096 --> 01:18:46,327
I can't let my family down.

1008
01:18:46,362 --> 01:18:49,396
You're just like him.
You know that?

1009
01:18:49,431 --> 01:18:50,760
Who?

1010
01:18:50,795 --> 01:18:52,003
Optimus.

1011
01:18:53,534 --> 01:18:55,072
I'm serious.

1012
01:18:55,107 --> 01:18:58,504
He feels it too.
Feels what?

1013
01:18:58,539 --> 01:19:00,671
Like a beast of burden

1014
01:19:00,706 --> 01:19:04,609
just trying to carry the weight
of the world on his shoulders.

1015
01:19:06,085 --> 01:19:09,581
You think he's some--
some general barking orders,

1016
01:19:09,616 --> 01:19:11,924
but when I look at him,

1017
01:19:11,959 --> 01:19:14,861
all I see is a big brother
trying to protect his family.

1018
01:20:12,514 --> 01:20:13,854
Are you okay?

1019
01:20:20,456 --> 01:20:21,587
Airazor?

1020
01:20:21,622 --> 01:20:25,327
I can feel Scourge!

1021
01:20:25,362 --> 01:20:27,934
- He's...
- ...in my mind.

1022
01:20:37,341 --> 01:20:39,946
Run, Elena!

1023
01:20:42,676 --> 01:20:44,049
No!

1024
01:20:47,615 --> 01:20:50,649
Airazor.

1025
01:20:50,684 --> 01:20:52,090
They found us.

1026
01:20:52,125 --> 01:20:55,555
Everyone, defensive positions!

1027
01:20:55,590 --> 01:20:58,195
Noah, guard the key.

1028
01:20:58,230 --> 01:21:01,396
Take Elena and find someplace safe to hide.

1029
01:21:02,927 --> 01:21:04,795
We must protect the humans.

1030
01:21:07,404 --> 01:21:09,239
Miss me?

1031
01:21:09,274 --> 01:21:12,176
Noah, Elena, get out of here!

1032
01:21:28,161 --> 01:21:29,853
We have to destroy it.

1033
01:21:32,099 --> 01:21:33,263
Noah!

1034
01:21:33,298 --> 01:21:34,825
No!

1035
01:21:35,729 --> 01:21:37,432
Don't.

1036
01:21:39,898 --> 01:21:43,702
I know you want to protect your people,

1037
01:21:43,737 --> 01:21:46,474
but if you destroy that key,

1038
01:21:46,509 --> 01:21:49,444
our home will be lost forever.

1039
01:21:49,479 --> 01:21:51,743
We do not have to choose.

1040
01:21:58,488 --> 01:22:00,323
Please, Noah.

1041
01:22:18,673 --> 01:22:20,376
Elena!

1042
01:22:24,745 --> 01:22:25,777
Go!

1043
01:22:47,801 --> 01:22:49,207
Elena!

1044
01:22:54,313 --> 01:22:58,150
Wait, wait.
Didn't I kill you already?

1045
01:22:59,186 --> 01:23:00,911
No!

1046
01:23:00,946 --> 01:23:03,617
I'm the Maximal that's going
to rip out your spark.

1047
01:23:03,652 --> 01:23:06,818
We'll see about that.

1048
01:23:06,853 --> 01:23:07,951
Kill them!

1049
01:23:14,828 --> 01:23:16,135
Airazor, no!

1050
01:23:16,170 --> 01:23:19,028
I can't hold it back...

1051
01:23:19,063 --> 01:23:20,964
...much longer.

1052
01:23:20,999 --> 01:23:23,340
Fight it, Airazor.

1053
01:23:24,343 --> 01:23:27,344
Remember our oath, Primal.

1054
01:23:27,379 --> 01:23:30,039
No matter the cost.

1055
01:23:30,074 --> 01:23:33,680
I can't hold it back!
Airazor, no!

1056
01:23:45,397 --> 01:23:46,693
Primal!

1057
01:23:54,098 --> 01:23:57,341
It's okay.

1058
01:23:57,376 --> 01:23:58,837
Do it.

1059
01:24:22,698 --> 01:24:24,302
Primal.

1060
01:24:25,767 --> 01:24:27,602
No matter the cost.

1061
01:24:36,679 --> 01:24:38,382
Elena!
Elena, look at me.

1062
01:24:39,715 --> 01:24:40,945
Are you okay?

1063
01:24:43,752 --> 01:24:45,290
Scourge has the key.

1064
01:25:29,996 --> 01:25:34,603
Awaken, almighty Unicron.
Your time has come.

1065
01:26:37,701 --> 01:26:40,636
I am sorry, Noah.

1066
01:26:40,671 --> 01:26:42,440
You were looking out for your own.

1067
01:26:45,544 --> 01:26:47,577
I can't even be angry at you for that.

1068
01:26:47,612 --> 01:26:52,043
On my home world, we believe that
the battle with darkness will continue

1069
01:26:52,078 --> 01:26:54,210
till all are one.

1070
01:26:55,752 --> 01:26:57,818
I lost sight of that.

1071
01:26:57,853 --> 01:27:01,888
You fought for yours as I fought for mine

1072
01:27:01,923 --> 01:27:05,364
when we should have been
fighting the darkness together.

1073
01:27:09,062 --> 01:27:11,469
Well, I ain't done fighting yet.

1074
01:27:16,135 --> 01:27:18,234
All right, everybody, squad up!

1075
01:27:18,269 --> 01:27:19,906
Bring it in.

1076
01:27:19,941 --> 01:27:21,941
There's got to be a way to stop this dude.

1077
01:27:21,976 --> 01:27:26,077
It's too late. The Transwarp
has already been activated.

1078
01:27:26,112 --> 01:27:28,849
It has more energy than a supernova.

1079
01:27:28,884 --> 01:27:31,753
Any interruption
will ignite it like a bomb.

1080
01:27:32,954 --> 01:27:34,789
The only way to stop this process

1081
01:27:34,824 --> 01:27:38,188
is an access code installed
long ago as a safeguard.

1082
01:27:38,223 --> 01:27:39,695
Okay, what's the code then?

1083
01:27:39,730 --> 01:27:42,401
The code was split along with the key.

1084
01:27:42,436 --> 01:27:46,636
Sadly, the second half of
that code died with Airazor.

1085
01:27:46,671 --> 01:27:48,198
No, wait, wait, wait.
I got it.

1086
01:27:48,233 --> 01:27:49,903
The one hiding her half of the key--

1087
01:27:49,938 --> 01:27:51,707
that had markings in it

1088
01:27:51,742 --> 01:27:54,138
just like the ones I found in
the cave where you hid yours.

1089
01:27:54,173 --> 01:27:57,207
Together, they must complete the access code.

1090
01:27:57,242 --> 01:27:58,274
Hmm.

1091
01:27:58,309 --> 01:28:00,243
So we got a chance now, right?

1092
01:28:00,278 --> 01:28:01,783
A slim chance.

1093
01:28:01,818 --> 01:28:03,752
That is all we need

1094
01:28:03,787 --> 01:28:06,326
if you will show us the way, Primal.

1095
01:28:09,353 --> 01:28:12,090
All right.
We need to move quickly.

1096
01:28:12,125 --> 01:28:14,323
We have a small window before the portal opens

1097
01:28:14,358 --> 01:28:16,160
large enough for Unicron to enter.

1098
01:28:16,195 --> 01:28:19,471
The bridge is girded by a series of tunnels.

1099
01:28:19,506 --> 01:28:21,836
They are too small for Maximals, but...

1100
01:28:21,871 --> 01:28:23,673
But not for humans.

1101
01:28:23,708 --> 01:28:27,446
If Noah and Elena
reach the central antenna,

1102
01:28:27,481 --> 01:28:29,943
they can use the code to shut it down,

1103
01:28:29,978 --> 01:28:32,616
remove the Transwarp Key...

1104
01:28:32,651 --> 01:28:36,620
...and close the portal before
Unicron enters our atmosphere.

1105
01:28:36,655 --> 01:28:38,820
But Scourge will be watching our every move.

1106
01:28:38,855 --> 01:28:41,317
He'll do anything to stop us
from getting the key.

1107
01:28:41,352 --> 01:28:43,528
Then we bring the fight to him.

1108
01:28:43,563 --> 01:28:45,860
Autobots and Maximals

1109
01:28:45,895 --> 01:28:48,225
will charge the bridge together

1110
01:28:48,260 --> 01:28:50,898
and lure Scourge onto the battlefield.

1111
01:28:50,933 --> 01:28:53,802
While me and Elena sneak in
through the back way.

1112
01:28:56,972 --> 01:28:59,203
It sounds like we're all going to die.

1113
01:29:00,877 --> 01:29:05,550
If we are to die,
then we will die fighting

1114
01:29:05,585 --> 01:29:07,552
all as one.

1115
01:29:19,764 --> 01:29:23,601
This world is yours, master.

1116
01:29:24,395 --> 01:29:26,329
Scourge,

1117
01:29:26,364 --> 01:29:27,704
they're back.

1118
01:29:33,173 --> 01:29:36,779
Prime.

1119
01:29:38,277 --> 01:29:42,246
Protect the key.
Don't let them get to the bridge.

1120
01:30:02,906 --> 01:30:04,202
Maximals!

1121
01:30:04,237 --> 01:30:06,039
Autobots!

1122
01:30:06,074 --> 01:30:07,711
Roll out!

1123
01:30:18,757 --> 01:30:22,022
Rhinox, Cheetor, maximize!

1124
01:30:45,509 --> 01:30:47,443
At least the foot soldiers took the bait.

1125
01:30:47,478 --> 01:30:49,753
Yeah, but Scourge didn't.
He's guarding the key.

1126
01:30:49,788 --> 01:30:53,922
All right. This should lead to
the bottom of the Transwarp control panel.

1127
01:30:53,957 --> 01:30:57,288
Get the key, get the hell out of there.
What are you gonna do?

1128
01:30:57,323 --> 01:30:59,422
I'm gonna go distract Scourge.

1129
01:30:59,457 --> 01:31:01,160
No, you can't take on Scourge alone.

1130
01:31:01,195 --> 01:31:03,866
Relax.
I'm Mirage, remember?

1131
01:31:04,363 --> 01:31:05,703
Hey.

1132
01:31:41,202 --> 01:31:43,433
One, two, three!

1133
01:31:43,468 --> 01:31:45,501
Whoomp!
There it is! Pow!

1134
01:31:46,845 --> 01:31:48,009
We gotta hurry up.

1135
01:31:53,016 --> 01:31:56,182
Take cover!

1136
01:31:56,217 --> 01:31:58,690
Someone give me a real fight!

1137
01:32:01,090 --> 01:32:04,058
It's a fight you want?
You got one.

1138
01:32:18,206 --> 01:32:20,613
He was mine.

1139
01:32:21,781 --> 01:32:22,978
Nope!

1140
01:32:23,541 --> 01:32:24,584
Missed me!

1141
01:32:27,347 --> 01:32:29,886
Noah, get to the key.

1142
01:32:29,921 --> 01:32:31,547
Mirage!

1143
01:32:31,582 --> 01:32:33,923
What do we have here?

1144
01:32:33,958 --> 01:32:35,925
Elena, go!

1145
01:32:39,128 --> 01:32:43,768
Brave, but futile.

1146
01:32:46,773 --> 01:32:49,609
Hey!
Don't mess with my boy!

1147
01:33:12,392 --> 01:33:13,666
Mirage.

1148
01:33:19,135 --> 01:33:22,268
No one will remember this pathetic planet.

1149
01:33:23,634 --> 01:33:26,745
And no one will remember you.

1150
01:33:30,883 --> 01:33:32,443
Mirage, what are you doing?

1151
01:33:32,478 --> 01:33:34,786
Keeping my promise.

1152
01:33:34,821 --> 01:33:37,448
Mirage, no!
Come on, you gotta get up!

1153
01:33:37,483 --> 01:33:39,054
It's okay, Noah.

1154
01:33:44,391 --> 01:33:45,929
Home-- Home team.

1155
01:33:48,032 --> 01:33:49,592
Home team.

1156
01:33:52,806 --> 01:33:54,498
Mirage!

1157
01:33:57,338 --> 01:33:58,843
Mirage?

1158
01:34:01,045 --> 01:34:03,881
Mirage.

1159
01:34:04,752 --> 01:34:06,675
Kill the other human.

1160
01:34:44,055 --> 01:34:45,791
Unicron.

1161
01:34:45,826 --> 01:34:48,486
You fought bravely.

1162
01:34:48,521 --> 01:34:52,765
But this world is already mine.

1163
01:35:02,073 --> 01:35:03,567
We're too late.

1164
01:35:12,853 --> 01:35:14,446
Yo!
Hey!

1165
01:35:16,747 --> 01:35:21,090
Hey! Look!

1166
01:35:33,764 --> 01:35:36,336
<i>Hey, Knuckles.</i>

1167
01:35:36,371 --> 01:35:39,273
<i>You there? Over.</i>

1168
01:35:39,308 --> 01:35:40,604
<i>Yo, Sonic.</i>

1169
01:35:41,277 --> 01:35:43,244
Kris!
<i>Noah?</i>

1170
01:35:44,049 --> 01:35:45,576
What's going on?

1171
01:35:45,611 --> 01:35:47,215
Where's Mirage?

1172
01:35:47,250 --> 01:35:50,548
He-- He's gone.

1173
01:35:50,583 --> 01:35:51,857
<i>Gone?</i>

1174
01:35:53,993 --> 01:35:56,653
No.

1175
01:35:59,229 --> 01:36:00,756
<i>I'm sorry, Kris.</i>

1176
01:36:08,337 --> 01:36:10,403
<i>I'm not gonna win this one.</i>

1177
01:36:10,438 --> 01:36:12,735
But you don't lose, right?

1178
01:36:13,441 --> 01:36:14,847
I wish that were true,

1179
01:36:15,839 --> 01:36:16,915
but I can't.

1180
01:36:23,352 --> 01:36:25,121
<i>Yes, you can.</i>

1181
01:36:26,157 --> 01:36:28,124
No.

1182
01:36:29,820 --> 01:36:32,260
No, man, I'm not you.

1183
01:36:32,295 --> 01:36:33,525
<i>I hate being sick.</i>

1184
01:36:33,560 --> 01:36:35,098
<i>Whenever I wanna give up,</i>

1185
01:36:35,133 --> 01:36:37,529
you're always there telling me to keep going.

1186
01:36:38,268 --> 01:36:39,630
<i>But now it's my turn.</i>

1187
01:36:39,665 --> 01:36:41,335
Keep going, Noah.

1188
01:36:43,471 --> 01:36:47,913
<i>You think you're a nobody, but
you're the strongest guy I know.</i>

1189
01:36:47,948 --> 01:36:50,476
You guys are so cute.

1190
01:36:51,182 --> 01:36:52,247
Mirage?

1191
01:36:52,282 --> 01:36:54,249
You're alive!

1192
01:36:54,284 --> 01:36:59,716
Uh, yeah, but...
I'm gonna need you to take the wheel.

1193
01:37:10,597 --> 01:37:12,432
<i>You can do this.</i>

1194
01:37:17,142 --> 01:37:18,977
<i>'Cause you're my brother.</i>

1195
01:37:19,012 --> 01:37:21,914
Noah Diaz from Wilson Avenue,

1196
01:37:23,346 --> 01:37:25,676
<i>Apartment 2-C,
Brooklyn, New York.</i>

1197
01:37:29,187 --> 01:37:31,286
No names over the airwaves.

1198
01:37:31,992 --> 01:37:33,420
Forget that.

1199
01:37:33,455 --> 01:37:34,927
Let 'em know who you are.

1200
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:41,164
Yo, Scourge!

1201
01:37:46,270 --> 01:37:47,830
Remember me?

1202
01:38:08,721 --> 01:38:11,722
You think you can take me on alone?

1203
01:38:14,826 --> 01:38:17,101
He is not alone.

1204
01:39:03,050 --> 01:39:05,116
I'm never leaving Brooklyn again.

1205
01:39:17,526 --> 01:39:20,428
Ah! Energon.

1206
01:39:50,053 --> 01:39:51,492
Prime!

1207
01:39:54,167 --> 01:39:55,199
Noah!

1208
01:40:12,317 --> 01:40:15,615
I'm getting really tired of you humans.

1209
01:40:48,683 --> 01:40:50,980
Bee!

1210
01:40:55,723 --> 01:40:59,395
You again.
You should've stayed dead!

1211
01:41:21,320 --> 01:41:24,079
<i>I have come here to kick ass.</i>

1212
01:41:24,114 --> 01:41:25,454
Glad to have you back.

1213
01:41:25,489 --> 01:41:27,456
Everyone guard the bridge!

1214
01:41:27,491 --> 01:41:30,426
Elena, shut it down!

1215
01:41:36,533 --> 01:41:38,434
We gotta give her some cover!

1216
01:41:38,469 --> 01:41:39,996
We'll clear the way.

1217
01:41:42,968 --> 01:41:44,737
That's what I'm talkin' about.

1218
01:41:44,772 --> 01:41:48,180
Punch in an access code...
How hard could that be?

1219
01:41:51,845 --> 01:41:53,680
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

1220
01:41:59,556 --> 01:42:01,787
Just you and me, Scourge.

1221
01:42:06,299 --> 01:42:10,125
Let's end this once and for all.

1222
01:42:10,160 --> 01:42:12,094
Master, the reinforcements!

1223
01:42:33,392 --> 01:42:34,655
All right, I got this.

1224
01:42:34,690 --> 01:42:35,755
Let's go, Bee!

1225
01:42:44,194 --> 01:42:46,337
<i>Say hello to my little friend!</i>

1226
01:43:09,527 --> 01:43:10,889
We gotta hurry!

1227
01:43:11,694 --> 01:43:12,694
Last one.

1228
01:43:13,696 --> 01:43:15,960
Die, you ugly mother--

1229
01:43:52,603 --> 01:43:56,374
You will never see Unicron take this world.

1230
01:44:03,108 --> 01:44:04,712
You did it!

1231
01:44:04,747 --> 01:44:06,241
Brooklyn, baby!

1232
01:44:06,276 --> 01:44:08,320
No!

1233
01:44:08,949 --> 01:44:11,048
Unicron will prevail!

1234
01:44:11,083 --> 01:44:12,588
Elena!

1235
01:44:16,121 --> 01:44:18,154
I've had enough!

1236
01:44:20,862 --> 01:44:24,567
Time to show you the real power of the Prime!

1237
01:44:28,474 --> 01:44:31,607
This belongs to a friend of mine!

1238
01:44:44,622 --> 01:44:45,654
The panel,

1239
01:44:46,492 --> 01:44:47,887
it's destroyed.

1240
01:44:48,725 --> 01:44:50,120
I can't stop it.

1241
01:44:51,530 --> 01:44:54,025
Autobots, Maximals,

1242
01:44:54,060 --> 01:44:55,664
retreat to safety.

1243
01:44:55,699 --> 01:44:58,799
I will destroy the key myself.

1244
01:44:58,834 --> 01:45:00,471
Prime!
No!

1245
01:45:00,506 --> 01:45:02,099
There's gotta be another way.

1246
01:45:02,134 --> 01:45:03,969
Bee, protect them.

1247
01:45:12,782 --> 01:45:16,520
Your sacrifice becomes our oath.

1248
01:45:17,314 --> 01:45:20,117
Thank you, my friends.

1249
01:45:24,464 --> 01:45:27,531
Bee!

1250
01:45:27,566 --> 01:45:29,632
We can't leave him!

1251
01:45:36,168 --> 01:45:38,333
Everyone, on me!

1252
01:45:50,215 --> 01:45:51,885
Don't, Prime.

1253
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:55,152
I can give you everything you want.

1254
01:45:55,187 --> 01:45:56,593
Then die.

1255
01:46:34,996 --> 01:46:36,061
Noah.

1256
01:46:36,096 --> 01:46:37,535
I got you!

1257
01:46:48,746 --> 01:46:51,406
Let me go, Noah.
Save yourself.

1258
01:46:53,553 --> 01:46:56,048
Till all are one.

1259
01:47:16,070 --> 01:47:18,103
Till all are one.

1260
01:47:30,689 --> 01:47:31,952
Punch it, Prime.

1261
01:47:59,509 --> 01:48:00,552
Yeah, baby!

1262
01:48:31,442 --> 01:48:34,014
Unicron...
Is he dead?

1263
01:48:34,049 --> 01:48:37,215
Trapped, but not dead.

1264
01:48:37,250 --> 01:48:39,723
Evil can never be vanquished completely.

1265
01:48:40,759 --> 01:48:42,187
He could return.

1266
01:48:42,222 --> 01:48:44,288
Let him come.

1267
01:48:44,323 --> 01:48:47,324
United, we will destroy him,

1268
01:48:47,359 --> 01:48:49,392
once and for all.

1269

1273

<i>But we have gained an ally</i>

1274

<i>in our battle against
the forces of evil.</i>

1275
01:49:12,549 --> 01:49:14,890
<i>Forces too powerful</i>

1276

temple with a network of catacombs...</i>

1291
01:50:36,666 --> 01:50:39,469
<i>...dating back to 5000 BC.</i>

1292
01:50:39,504 --> 01:50:43,143
<i>I never could've imagined making
a discovery of this significance.</i>

1293
01:50:43,178 --> 01:50:45,882
<i>So it's definitely a dream come true.</i>

1294
01:50:47,314 --> 01:50:48,786
Brooklyn, baby.

1295
01:50:48,821 --> 01:50:50,887
They're ready for you.

1296
01:50:50,922 --> 01:50:52,889
Thank you, sir.
Elevator in the back.

1297
01:50:58,028 --> 01:51:00,259
Why don't you tell me about your strengths?

1298
01:51:00,294 --> 01:51:02,525
In addition to my experience with electronics,

1299
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:06,232
I've also been really developing
my team-building skills too.

1300
01:51:07,972 --> 01:51:09,598
Is that so?

1301
01:51:09,633 --> 01:51:12,568
Look, I'm gonna be honest with you.

1302
01:51:12,603 --> 01:51:15,043
Résumé's a little thin.

1303
01:51:15,078 --> 01:51:17,716
Yeah, well,
I just recently had a job

1304
01:51:18,444 --> 01:51:20,543
working internationally.

1305
01:51:20,578 --> 01:51:21,984
Oh, was that...

1306
01:51:23,955 --> 01:51:26,153
No, I don't think it's on here.

1307
01:51:26,188 --> 01:51:28,892
No, it was...
it was a short-term contract.

1308
01:51:28,927 --> 01:51:31,686
Oh, well, that's cool.

1309
01:51:31,721 --> 01:51:33,391
Why don't you tell me about that?

1310
01:51:36,836 --> 01:51:40,563
It was in South America.
So I got to work on my Spanish.

1311
01:51:40,598 --> 01:51:42,235
My mom was real happy about that.

1312
01:51:42,270 --> 01:51:44,534
You know what I'm saying?
You know moms.

1313
01:51:44,569 --> 01:51:47,372
She's just really-- But while I
was out there, honestly, man,

1314
01:51:47,407 --> 01:51:50,375
it was really just like
work, work, work, you know?

1315
01:51:50,410 --> 01:51:54,214
Ah. That's a shame, because I hear
the food is really good in Peru.

1316
01:51:56,746 --> 01:51:59,219
Wait, I didn't-- I didn't
mention anything about Peru.

1317
01:51:59,254 --> 01:52:01,551
Well, that's where you were, right?

1318
01:52:01,586 --> 01:52:04,026
I was-- Down in Cusco?

1319
01:52:04,061 --> 01:52:06,930
With you and, uh, Elena

1320
01:52:07,691 --> 01:52:09,394
and your, um,

1321
01:52:09,429 --> 01:52:11,297
I don't know, call 'em friends?

1322
01:52:14,874 --> 01:52:16,764
What...

1323
01:52:16,799 --> 01:52:18,733
What's going on in here?

1324
01:52:18,768 --> 01:52:21,241
We know a lot about you, Mr. Diaz.

1325
01:52:21,276 --> 01:52:24,849
Who are you?
The CIA or FBI or...

1326
01:52:24,884 --> 01:52:27,885
We are a secret government organization.

1327
01:52:27,920 --> 01:52:29,612
Strictly off the books.

1328
01:52:29,647 --> 01:52:31,449
We specialize in global threats.

1329
01:52:31,484 --> 01:52:34,452
Planetary loss prevention,
that kind of thing.

1330
01:52:34,487 --> 01:52:37,653
We're in the middle of an ongoing war,

1331
01:52:37,688 --> 01:52:39,831
and we'd love to have you join the fight.

1332
01:52:39,866 --> 01:52:41,756
You and your whole team.

1333
01:52:42,429 --> 01:52:43,461
You know,

1334
01:52:44,970 --> 01:52:46,233
the big guys.

1335
01:52:46,268 --> 01:52:48,103
No idea what you're talking about.

1336
01:52:49,799 --> 01:52:51,568
That's a good answer.

1337
01:52:51,603 --> 01:52:53,009
All right.

1338
01:52:53,044 --> 01:52:55,737
Either way, I want you to know,

1339
01:52:55,772 --> 01:52:58,146
in lieu of the thanks of a grateful nation,

1340
01:52:58,181 --> 01:53:01,248
we will be taking care of
your brother Kris's health care.

1341
01:53:01,283 --> 01:53:02,480
All of it.

1342
01:53:02,515 --> 01:53:05,153
From now on,
he will have 24/7 access

1343
01:53:05,188 --> 01:53:07,353
to the greatest doctors in the world.

1344
01:53:07,388 --> 01:53:10,785
And these are doctors who don't ask
their patients about account balances.

1345
01:53:15,693 --> 01:53:17,330
Are you serious?

1346
01:53:17,365 --> 01:53:19,970
You saved the world, kid.
It's the least we can do.

1347
01:53:20,005 --> 01:53:21,664
I don't know what to say.

1348
01:53:21,699 --> 01:53:23,534
We'll work on that.

1349
01:53:25,175 --> 01:53:27,142
Your brother's gonna be just fine.

1350
01:53:32,875 --> 01:53:34,479
Oh.

1351
01:53:34,514 --> 01:53:36,382
Kris was right, by the way.

1352
01:53:45,888 --> 01:53:47,492
No names over the airwaves.

1353
01:53:49,133 --> 01:53:51,661
We could
really use someone like you, Noah.

1354
01:53:51,696 --> 01:53:54,037
Why don't you think about it?

1355
01:54:16,292 --> 01:54:17,687
"G.I. Joe"?

1356
01:54:55,232 --> 01:54:58,695
Come on, baby,
show me some. Show me some.

1357
01:54:58,730 --> 01:55:00,169
That oughta do it.

1358
01:55:00,204 --> 01:55:03,931
This?

1359
01:55:03,966 --> 01:55:07,737
This is a complete waste of
your skills and my expertise.

1360
01:55:07,772 --> 01:55:09,409
Think it came out pretty good.

1361
01:55:10,808 --> 01:55:13,281
Well, I guess we could call it modern art

1362
01:55:13,316 --> 01:55:15,547
and sell it to some cats in SoHo.

1363
01:55:15,582 --> 01:55:16,779
Nah, I'm not selling.

1364
01:55:16,814 --> 01:55:17,846
What?

1365
01:55:18,585 --> 01:55:19,617
Why?

1366
01:55:20,983 --> 01:55:22,620
Is this about the 5-0 thing?

1367
01:55:23,623 --> 01:55:26,327
No. I told you,
I did not ditch you!

1368
01:55:26,362 --> 01:55:29,099
I was running the give-and-go.
I thought you knew the play!

1369
01:55:29,134 --> 01:55:32,465
All right, let's say I did ditch you,
even though I didn't.

1370
01:55:32,500 --> 01:55:34,962
For your sake-- I see your face--
let's just say I did.

1371
01:55:34,997 --> 01:55:37,173
I think all the blood,
sweat and dead presidents

1372
01:55:37,208 --> 01:55:40,473
I put into getting these car parts
for you make us even steven.

1373
01:55:40,508 --> 01:55:42,409
It's not that.

1374
01:55:42,444 --> 01:55:44,312
This car is special.

1375
01:55:44,347 --> 01:55:47,810
This car is a jigsaw puzzle made of garbage!

1376
01:55:47,845 --> 01:55:52,254
Hey, I bet the joint don't even start.

1377
01:55:54,786 --> 01:55:55,917
Bet?

1378
01:55:57,294 --> 01:55:58,656
Yo, Mirage.

1379
01:56:08,305 --> 01:56:09,634
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1380
01:56:09,669 --> 01:56:13,209
Yeah!
Your boy is back!

1381
01:56:13,244 --> 01:56:15,541
This dude said I wasn't even gonna start!
