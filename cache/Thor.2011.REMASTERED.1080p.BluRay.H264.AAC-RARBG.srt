1
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,953
Wait for it.

2
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:27,706
- Can I turn on the radio?
- No.

3
00:01:32,169 --> 00:01:34,671
Jane, you can't keep doing this.

4
00:01:35,672 --> 00:01:39,259
The last 17 occurrences
have been predictable to the second.

5
00:01:39,343 --> 00:01:42,095
Jane, you're an astrophysicist,
not some storm chaser.

6
00:01:42,179 --> 00:01:44,056
I'm telling you, there's a connection

7
00:01:44,139 --> 00:01:46,934
between these atmospheric
disturbances and my research.

8
00:01:47,017 --> 00:01:51,480
Erik, I wouldn't have asked you to fly
out here if I wasn't absolutely sure.

9
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:52,940
Jane?

10
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:54,983
I think you want to see this.

11
00:01:59,404 --> 00:02:00,404
What is that?

12
00:02:07,746 --> 00:02:10,123
I thought you said it was a subtle aurora!

13
00:02:10,582 --> 00:02:11,750
Go!

14
00:02:18,632 --> 00:02:20,759
- Get closer.
- Right. Good one.

15
00:02:20,842 --> 00:02:22,094
Go!

16
00:02:39,695 --> 00:02:40,904
What are you doing?

17
00:02:40,988 --> 00:02:44,157
I am not dying for six college credits!

18
00:03:05,262 --> 00:03:06,972
I think that was legally your fault.

19
00:03:07,055 --> 00:03:08,807
Get the first aid kit.

20
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,350
Do me a favor and don't be dead.

21
00:03:10,434 --> 00:03:11,893
Please.

22
00:03:17,274 --> 00:03:18,692
Where did he come from?

23
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,128
<i>Once,</i>

24
00:03:38,211 --> 00:03:41,965
<i>mankind accepted a simple truth,</i>

25
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:45,719
<i>that they were not alone
in this universe.</i>

26
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:51,433
<i>Some worlds man believed
to be home to their gods.</i>

27
00:03:52,267 --> 00:03:54,853
<i>Others, they knew to fear.</i>

28
00:03:58,607 --> 00:04:02,903
<i>From a realm of cold and darkness
came the Frost Giants,</i>

29
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:20,504
<i>threatening to plunge the mortal world
into a new ice age.</i>

30
00:04:26,885 --> 00:04:31,556
<i>But humanity would not face
this threat alone.</i>

31
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:12,514
<i>Our armies drove the Frost Giants
back into the heart of their own world.</i>

32
00:05:15,934 --> 00:05:18,103
<i>The cost was great.</i>

33
00:05:18,854 --> 00:05:20,522
<i>In the end,</i>

34
00:05:20,605 --> 00:05:22,649
<i>their king fell.</i>

35
00:05:27,028 --> 00:05:30,031
<i>And the source of their power
was taken from them.</i>

36
00:05:31,408 --> 00:05:33,660
<i>With the last great war ended,</i>

37
00:05:33,744 --> 00:05:37,330
<i>we withdrew from the other worlds
and returned home</i>

38
00:05:38,206 --> 00:05:40,375
<i>to the Realm Eternal,</i>

39
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,378
<i>Asgard.</i>

40
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:17,537
<i>Here we remain as a beacon of hope,</i>

41
00:06:18,747 --> 00:06:21,583
<i>shining out across the stars.</i>

42
00:06:22,584 --> 00:06:25,879
<i>And though we have fallen
into man's myths and legends,</i>

43
00:06:27,255 --> 00:06:29,508
<i>it was Asgard</i>

44
00:06:29,591 --> 00:06:31,593
<i>and its warriors</i>

45
00:06:31,676 --> 00:06:32,928
<i>that brought peace</i>

46
00:06:33,845 --> 00:06:34,930
<i>to the universe.</i>

47
00:06:38,934 --> 00:06:41,603
But the day will come

48
00:06:43,146 --> 00:06:44,481
when one of you

49
00:06:45,607 --> 00:06:47,400
will have to defend that peace.

50
00:06:48,151 --> 00:06:50,070
Do the Frost Giants still live?

51
00:06:50,654 --> 00:06:51,655
When I'm king,

52
00:06:52,656 --> 00:06:55,367
I'll hunt the monsters down
and slay them all!

53
00:06:56,785 --> 00:06:58,036
Just as you did, Father.

54
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,455
A wise king

55
00:07:00,956 --> 00:07:03,542
never seeks out war.

56
00:07:04,084 --> 00:07:05,085
But...

57
00:07:09,798 --> 00:07:12,050
he must always be ready for it.

58
00:07:23,854 --> 00:07:26,314
- I'm ready, Father.
- So am I.

59
00:07:27,482 --> 00:07:30,110
Only one of you can ascend to the throne.

60
00:07:30,193 --> 00:07:33,905
But both of you were born to be kings.

61
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,800
<i>FarangSiam thanks you. Enjoy!</i>

62
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:56,344
Oh, please.

63
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,570
Yeah!

64
00:08:53,234 --> 00:08:56,404
Thor Odinson,

65
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:59,574
my heir,

66
00:09:02,619 --> 00:09:04,537
my firstborn.

67
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:10,043
<i>So long entrusted with
the mighty hammer Mjolnir,</i>

68
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:14,195
forged in the heart of a dying star,

69
00:09:14,547 --> 00:09:16,758
<i>its power has no equal,</i>

70
00:09:17,258 --> 00:09:19,719
<i>as a weapon to destroy</i>

71
00:09:20,261 --> 00:09:22,097
<i>or as a tool to build.</i>

72
00:09:23,139 --> 00:09:25,392
'Tis a fit companion for a king.

73
00:09:27,394 --> 00:09:29,980
<i>I have defended Asgard</i>

74
00:09:30,063 --> 00:09:34,150
<i>and the lives of the innocent
across the Nine Realms</i>

75
00:09:34,234 --> 00:09:36,319
<i>from the time of the great beginning.</i>

76
00:09:37,153 --> 00:09:38,738
<i>Though the day has come...</i>

77
00:10:05,432 --> 00:10:08,184
Do you swear to guard the Nine Realms?

78
00:10:08,685 --> 00:10:09,686
I swear.

79
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:13,189
And do you swear to preserve the peace?

80
00:10:13,273 --> 00:10:14,315
I swear.

81
00:10:14,858 --> 00:10:16,693
Do you swear

82
00:10:17,902 --> 00:10:20,280
to cast aside all selfish ambition

83
00:10:20,363 --> 00:10:23,283
and to pledge yourself only
to the good of the Realms?

84
00:10:23,366 --> 00:10:24,366
I swear!

85
00:10:24,701 --> 00:10:26,828
Then, on this day,

86
00:10:27,245 --> 00:10:29,873
I, Odin Allfather,

87
00:10:31,374 --> 00:10:32,474
proclaim you...

88
00:10:46,598 --> 00:10:47,807
The Frost Giants!

89
00:11:33,103 --> 00:11:35,063
<i>The Jotuns must pay
for what they've done!</i>

90
00:11:35,146 --> 00:11:37,482
They have paid, with their lives.

91
00:11:38,942 --> 00:11:40,652
The Destroyer did its work,

92
00:11:41,111 --> 00:11:42,987
the Casket is safe, and all is well.

93
00:11:43,488 --> 00:11:44,614
All is well?

94
00:11:45,532 --> 00:11:47,867
They broke into the weapons vault!

95
00:11:48,284 --> 00:11:50,763
If the Frost Giants had stolen
even one of these relics...

96
00:11:50,773 --> 00:11:53,109
- They didn't.
- Well, I want to know why!

97
00:11:55,834 --> 00:11:58,002
I have a truce with Laufey,
King of the Jotuns.

98
00:11:58,086 --> 00:12:02,590
He just broke your truce!
They know you are vulnerable!

99
00:12:03,383 --> 00:12:04,592
What action would you take?

100
00:12:04,676 --> 00:12:08,054
March into Jotunheim as you once did.
Teach them a lesson.

101
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,556
Break their spirits

102
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:11,840
so they'll never dare try
to cross our borders again.

103
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,329
You're thinking only as a warrior.

104
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:14,435
This was an act of war!

105
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:16,813
It was the act of but a few,
doomed to fail.

106
00:12:16,896 --> 00:12:18,398
Look how far they got!

107
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:21,110
<i>We will find the breach in our defenses
and it will be sealed.</i>

108
00:12:21,144 --> 00:12:22,277
As King of Asgard...

109
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,155
But you're not king!

110
00:12:28,241 --> 00:12:29,325
Not yet.

111
00:13:01,191 --> 00:13:04,235
It's unwise to be in my company right now,
Brother.

112
00:13:05,236 --> 00:13:08,072
This was to be my day of triumph.

113
00:13:10,283 --> 00:13:11,618
It'll come.

114
00:13:12,911 --> 00:13:14,204
In time.

115
00:13:14,287 --> 00:13:16,581
What's this?

116
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:21,127
If it's any consolation,
I think you're right.

117
00:13:21,211 --> 00:13:24,047
About the Frost Giants, about Laufey,
about everything.

118
00:13:24,964 --> 00:13:28,009
If they found a way to penetrate
Asgard's defenses once,

119
00:13:28,092 --> 00:13:29,636
who's to say they won't try again?

120
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:31,804
- Next time with an army.
- Exactly.

121
00:13:31,888 --> 00:13:34,682
There's nothing you can do
without defying Father.

122
00:13:36,809 --> 00:13:38,686
No, no, no. I know that look.

123
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:41,162
That's the only way
to ensure the safety of our borders.

124
00:13:41,172 --> 00:13:42,298
Thor, it's madness.

125
00:13:42,482 --> 00:13:45,026
Madness? What sort of madness?

126
00:13:45,735 --> 00:13:47,362
We're going to Jotunheim.

127
00:13:49,072 --> 00:13:50,072
<i>What?</i>

128
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,242
This isn't like a journey to Earth

129
00:13:52,325 --> 00:13:54,369
where you summon a little lightning
and thunder,

130
00:13:54,452 --> 00:13:56,412
and the mortals worship you as a god.

131
00:13:57,247 --> 00:13:58,539
This is Jotunheim.

132
00:13:58,623 --> 00:14:00,917
My father fought his way into Jotunheim,

133
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,711
<i>defeated their armies
and took their Casket.</i>

134
00:14:04,254 --> 00:14:05,863
We would just be looking for answers.

135
00:14:05,873 --> 00:14:07,166
It is forbidden!

136
00:14:09,509 --> 00:14:12,178
My friends, have you forgotten all that
we have done together?

137
00:14:12,512 --> 00:14:14,347
<i>Fandral, Hogun.</i>

138
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:17,267
Who led you
into the most glorious of battles?

139
00:14:18,226 --> 00:14:19,227
You did.

140
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,688
And Volstagg, to delicacies so succulent,

141
00:14:21,771 --> 00:14:24,357
you thought you'd died
and gone to Valhalla?

142
00:14:25,942 --> 00:14:26,776
You did.

143
00:14:26,859 --> 00:14:27,860
Yes!

144
00:14:27,944 --> 00:14:29,988
And who proved wrong
all who scoffed at the idea

145
00:14:29,998 --> 00:14:32,448
that a young maiden could be
one of the fiercest warriors

146
00:14:32,532 --> 00:14:33,741
this realm has ever known?

147
00:14:33,825 --> 00:14:34,825
I did.

148
00:14:35,285 --> 00:14:37,120
True, but I supported you, Sif.

149
00:14:37,704 --> 00:14:39,080
My friends,

150
00:14:39,497 --> 00:14:41,249
we're going to Jotunheim.

151
00:15:32,925 --> 00:15:33,926
You leave this to me.

152
00:15:35,595 --> 00:15:38,222
- Good Heimdall...
- You're not dressed warmly enough.

153
00:15:38,306 --> 00:15:39,390
I'm sorry?

154
00:15:39,474 --> 00:15:42,310
Do you think that you can deceive me?

155
00:15:43,227 --> 00:15:44,706
- You must be mistaken...
- Enough!

156
00:15:48,441 --> 00:15:49,984
Heimdall, may we pass?

157
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:56,574
Never has an enemy slipped my watch
until this day.

158
00:15:58,409 --> 00:16:00,036
I wish to know how that happened.

159
00:16:00,119 --> 00:16:02,789
Then tell no one where we have gone
until we've returned.

160
00:16:02,872 --> 00:16:04,665
Understand?

161
00:16:09,087 --> 00:16:11,339
What happened? Silver tongue turn to lead?

162
00:16:56,342 --> 00:16:57,342
<i>Be warned.</i>

163
00:16:57,927 --> 00:17:02,098
I will honor my sworn oath
to protect this realm as its Gatekeeper.

164
00:17:02,849 --> 00:17:05,726
If your return
threatens the safety of Asgard,

165
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:08,020
Bifrost will remain closed to you

166
00:17:08,563 --> 00:17:11,566
<i>and you'll be left to die
in the cold waste of Jotunheim.</i>

167
00:17:11,649 --> 00:17:13,649
Couldn't you just leave
the bridge open for us?

168
00:17:13,693 --> 00:17:15,027
<i>To leave the bridge open</i>

169
00:17:15,111 --> 00:17:17,238
<i>would unleash
the full power of the Bifrost</i>

170
00:17:17,321 --> 00:17:20,450
<i>and destroy Jotunheim with you
upon it.</i>

171
00:17:20,992 --> 00:17:22,577
I have no plans to die today.

172
00:17:22,869 --> 00:17:24,078
None do.

173
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:11,834
We shouldn't be here.

174
00:18:14,253 --> 00:18:15,880
Let's move.

175
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,065
Where are they?

176
00:19:16,148 --> 00:19:17,483
Hiding,

177
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:19,151
as cowards always do.

178
00:19:29,579 --> 00:19:33,791
<i>You've come a long way to die,
Asgardians.</i>

179
00:19:33,874 --> 00:19:36,502
I am Thor Odinson!

180
00:19:36,586 --> 00:19:38,546
<i>We know who you are.</i>

181
00:19:38,838 --> 00:19:41,132
How did your people get into Asgard?

182
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,645
The House of Odin is full of traitors.

183
00:19:54,729 --> 00:19:57,982
Do not dishonor my father's name
with your lies!

184
00:19:58,065 --> 00:20:01,193
Your father is a murderer and a thief!

185
00:20:01,444 --> 00:20:04,655
And why have you come here? To make peace?

186
00:20:04,947 --> 00:20:07,992
You long for battle. You crave it.

187
00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:10,536
You're nothing but a boy

188
00:20:10,828 --> 00:20:13,289
trying to prove himself a man.

189
00:20:14,665 --> 00:20:18,002
Well, this "boy" has grown tired
of your mockery.

190
00:20:24,717 --> 00:20:27,303
Thor, stop and think.

191
00:20:27,386 --> 00:20:28,908
Look around you, we're outnumbered.

192
00:20:28,971 --> 00:20:30,598
Know your place, Brother.

193
00:20:30,681 --> 00:20:33,934
You know not what your actions
would unleash.

194
00:20:37,063 --> 00:20:38,314
I do.

195
00:20:39,231 --> 00:20:43,152
Go now, while I still allow it.

196
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,333
We will accept your most gracious offer.

197
00:21:09,887 --> 00:21:11,347
Come now, Brother.

198
00:21:16,852 --> 00:21:19,063
Run back home, little princess.

199
00:21:19,689 --> 00:21:20,689
Damn.

200
00:21:26,028 --> 00:21:27,196
Next?

201
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,592
At least make it a challenge for me!

202
00:22:08,988 --> 00:22:10,573
That's more like it.

203
00:22:46,358 --> 00:22:47,568
Don't let them touch you!

204
00:23:29,693 --> 00:23:31,070
Thor!

205
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:35,032
- We must go!
- Then go!

206
00:23:58,764 --> 00:24:00,057
Run!

207
00:24:02,226 --> 00:24:03,561
<i>Thor!</i>

208
00:25:09,209 --> 00:25:10,628
Heimdall!

209
00:25:10,961 --> 00:25:12,755
Open the bridge!

210
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:20,781
Father! We'll finish them together!

211
00:26:20,864 --> 00:26:22,366
Silence!

212
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,498
Allfather.

213
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,210
You look weary.

214
00:26:35,045 --> 00:26:36,130
Laufey,

215
00:26:36,588 --> 00:26:38,382
end this now.

216
00:26:38,465 --> 00:26:40,509
Your boy sought this out.

217
00:26:41,468 --> 00:26:42,636
<i>You're right.</i>

218
00:26:44,054 --> 00:26:46,932
And these are the actions of a boy,
treat them as such.

219
00:26:47,891 --> 00:26:52,271
You and I can end this here and now,
before there's further bloodshed.

220
00:26:52,354 --> 00:26:55,566
We are beyond diplomacy now, Allfather.

221
00:26:57,443 --> 00:26:58,902
He'll get what he came for.

222
00:27:00,237 --> 00:27:01,238
War

223
00:27:01,613 --> 00:27:02,948
<i>and death.</i>

224
00:27:04,533 --> 00:27:05,868
So be it.

225
00:27:29,752 --> 00:27:30,883
<i>Why did you bring us back?</i>

226
00:27:30,893 --> 00:27:31,925
<i>Do you realize what you've done?</i>

227
00:27:31,935 --> 00:27:33,844
<i>- What you've started?
- I was protecting my home.</i>

228
00:27:33,854 --> 00:27:35,480
<i>You cannot even protect your friends!</i>

229
00:27:35,481 --> 00:27:37,232
How can you hope to protect a kingdom?

230
00:27:37,316 --> 00:27:39,026
Get him to the healing room! Now!

231
00:27:39,109 --> 00:27:42,446
There won't be a kingdom to protect
if you're afraid to act.

232
00:27:43,864 --> 00:27:47,743
<i>The Jotuns must learn to fear me,
just as they once feared you.</i>

233
00:27:47,826 --> 00:27:50,245
<i>That's pride and vanity talking,
not leadership.</i>

234
00:27:50,329 --> 00:27:53,332
You've forgotten everything I taught you
about a warrior's patience.

235
00:27:53,415 --> 00:27:57,086
While you wait and be patient,
the Nine Realms laugh at us.

236
00:27:57,544 --> 00:27:58,545
The old ways are done.

237
00:27:58,629 --> 00:28:01,256
You'd stand giving speeches
while Asgard falls.

238
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:04,885
You are a vain, greedy, cruel boy!

239
00:28:04,968 --> 00:28:07,971
And you are an old man and a fool!

240
00:28:14,686 --> 00:28:15,686
<i>Yes.</i>

241
00:28:16,855 --> 00:28:18,232
I was a fool

242
00:28:19,608 --> 00:28:20,818
to think you were ready.

243
00:28:21,318 --> 00:28:23,612
Father...

244
00:28:26,031 --> 00:28:29,076
Thor Odinson,

245
00:28:30,786 --> 00:28:33,789
you have betrayed
the express command of your king.

246
00:28:34,331 --> 00:28:36,708
<i>Through your arrogance and stupidity,</i>

247
00:28:36,792 --> 00:28:39,628
<i>you've opened these peaceful realms
and innocent lives</i>

248
00:28:39,711 --> 00:28:43,590
to the horror and desolation of war!

249
00:28:49,471 --> 00:28:53,350
You are unworthy of these realms!

250
00:28:53,684 --> 00:28:56,311
You're unworthy of your title!

251
00:28:56,395 --> 00:28:58,105
You're unworthy

252
00:29:00,649 --> 00:29:04,653
of the loved ones you have betrayed.

253
00:29:15,622 --> 00:29:17,749
I now take from you your power!

254
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:21,295
In the name of my father

255
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,881
and his father before,

256
00:29:24,423 --> 00:29:27,092
I, Odin Allfather, cast you out!

257
00:29:33,807 --> 00:29:37,019
Whosoever holds this hammer,
if he be worthy,

258
00:29:37,102 --> 00:29:38,729
shall possess the power of Thor.

259
00:30:03,879 --> 00:30:05,464
I think that was legally your fault.

260
00:30:05,547 --> 00:30:07,299
Get the first aid kit.

261
00:30:07,382 --> 00:30:08,842
Do me a favor and don't be dead.

262
00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:16,850
Whoa. Does he need CPR?
Because I totally know CPR.

263
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,860
<i>[ CPR: CardioPulmonary Resuscitation ]</i>

264
00:30:29,738 --> 00:30:31,156
Where did he come from?

265
00:30:35,118 --> 00:30:36,119
You all right?

266
00:30:36,203 --> 00:30:37,287
Hammer?

267
00:30:37,704 --> 00:30:38,580
Hammer?

268
00:30:38,664 --> 00:30:41,012
Yeah, we can tell you're hammered.
It's pretty obvious.

269
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:44,044
Oh, my God. Erik, look at this!

270
00:30:44,127 --> 00:30:46,797
We have to move quickly
before this all changes.

271
00:30:47,656 --> 00:30:49,539
Jane, we have to take him to the hospital.

272
00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:51,969
- Father!
- He's fine, look at him.

273
00:30:52,052 --> 00:30:56,056
Heimdall! I know you can hear me!
Open the Bifrost!

274
00:30:56,139 --> 00:30:58,058
Hospital. You go, I'll stay.

275
00:30:58,141 --> 00:31:00,686
You. What realm is this?

276
00:31:00,769 --> 00:31:02,271
Alfheim? Nornheim?

277
00:31:02,354 --> 00:31:03,355
New Mexico.

278
00:31:03,605 --> 00:31:06,984
You dare threaten me, Thor,
with so puny a weapon?

279
00:31:11,154 --> 00:31:13,240
What? He was freaking me out!

280
00:31:13,699 --> 00:31:15,742
Next time you decide to taser somebody,

281
00:31:15,826 --> 00:31:18,287
make sure he's already in the car, okay?

282
00:31:19,454 --> 00:31:21,540
Jane! Come on.

283
00:31:39,391 --> 00:31:40,600
Name?

284
00:31:40,684 --> 00:31:42,894
He said it was Thor?

285
00:31:43,353 --> 00:31:46,565
T-H-O-R.

286
00:31:47,024 --> 00:31:49,651
- And your relationship to him?
- I've never met him before.

287
00:31:49,735 --> 00:31:51,194
Until she hit him with a car.

288
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:54,031
I grazed him, but she tasered him.

289
00:31:54,323 --> 00:31:55,574
Yes, I did.

290
00:31:57,367 --> 00:31:58,367
Hi.

291
00:31:59,745 --> 00:32:00,919
Just taking a little blood.

292
00:32:01,121 --> 00:32:03,248
How dare you attack the son of Odin?

293
00:32:03,332 --> 00:32:05,125
I need some help!

294
00:32:06,168 --> 00:32:07,836
Call security!

295
00:32:08,086 --> 00:32:10,255
Security to ER 3, stat!

296
00:32:24,102 --> 00:32:26,188
You're no match for the Mighty...

297
00:33:19,032 --> 00:33:20,032
Huh.

298
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:30,544
<i>You don't think this was just
a magnetic storm, do you?</i>

299
00:33:30,627 --> 00:33:33,672
Look, the lensing around these edges

300
00:33:33,755 --> 00:33:36,258
is characteristic
of an Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

301
00:33:36,341 --> 00:33:37,384
A what?

302
00:33:37,467 --> 00:33:39,946
- I thought you were a science major.
- Political science.

303
00:33:39,956 --> 00:33:41,388
She was the only applicant.

304
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,224
An Einstein-Rosen Bridge
is a theoretical connection

305
00:33:44,307 --> 00:33:46,134
between two different points
of space-time.

306
00:33:46,144 --> 00:33:47,018
It's a wormhole.

307
00:33:47,102 --> 00:33:50,063
- Erik, look. What do you see?
- Stars.

308
00:33:50,147 --> 00:33:52,023
Yeah, but not our stars.

309
00:33:52,107 --> 00:33:55,861
See, this is the star alignment
for our quadrant this time of year,

310
00:33:55,944 --> 00:33:59,030
and unless Ursa Minor decided
to take a day off,

311
00:33:59,448 --> 00:34:01,366
these are someone else's constellations.

312
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:03,285
Hey! Check this out.

313
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:11,835
No, it can't be.

314
00:34:13,795 --> 00:34:15,922
I think I left something at the hospital.

315
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,648
It's not possible!

316
00:34:47,287 --> 00:34:49,998
He was on drugs or something.
He just went nuts.

317
00:34:58,673 --> 00:35:00,342
Oh, my God.

318
00:35:03,762 --> 00:35:06,014
I just lost
my most important piece of evidence.

319
00:35:06,097 --> 00:35:06,932
Typical.

320
00:35:07,015 --> 00:35:09,267
- So now what?
- We find him.

321
00:35:09,324 --> 00:35:10,759
Did you see what he did in there?

322
00:35:10,769 --> 00:35:12,604
I'm not sure finding him is the best idea.

323
00:35:12,687 --> 00:35:15,687
Well, our data can't tell us
what it was like to be inside that event,

324
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:17,442
and he can. So, we're gonna find him.

325
00:35:18,026 --> 00:35:18,860
Okay.

326
00:35:18,944 --> 00:35:20,944
So we're gonna look all over New Mexico,
right?

327
00:35:21,696 --> 00:35:23,031
Exactly.

328
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,370
What?

329
00:35:29,371 --> 00:35:32,499
I'm so sorry.
I swear I'm not doing this on purpose.

330
00:35:42,759 --> 00:35:44,135
Yeah!

331
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,226
I got it, I got it.

332
00:36:00,986 --> 00:36:02,821
Come on, kick it in now!

333
00:36:11,496 --> 00:36:12,664
Did it work?

334
00:36:34,603 --> 00:36:36,646
Sir, we found it.

335
00:36:43,028 --> 00:36:47,282
You know, for a crazy homeless person,
he's pretty cut.

336
00:36:50,368 --> 00:36:52,454
Hey, sorry I tased you!

337
00:36:54,914 --> 00:36:56,916
Excuse me, excuse me!

338
00:37:02,839 --> 00:37:04,049
Uh...

339
00:37:04,132 --> 00:37:05,508
What is this?

340
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,176
Oh.

341
00:37:08,553 --> 00:37:09,721
My ex.

342
00:37:10,305 --> 00:37:14,309
Good with patients
and bad with relationships.

343
00:37:14,392 --> 00:37:16,770
Uh, they're the only clothes I had
that would fit you.

344
00:37:16,853 --> 00:37:17,853
They will suffice.

345
00:37:19,147 --> 00:37:19,981
You're welcome.

346
00:37:20,065 --> 00:37:21,608
This mortal form has grown weak.

347
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,400
I need sustenance.

348
00:37:43,088 --> 00:37:44,506
We should never have let him go.

349
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:46,257
There was no stopping him.

350
00:37:46,341 --> 00:37:48,301
Well, at least he's only banished,
not dead.

351
00:37:48,802 --> 00:37:49,889
Which is what we'd all be

352
00:37:49,899 --> 00:37:52,610
if that guard hadn't told Odin
where we'd gone.

353
00:37:59,104 --> 00:38:00,355
How did the guard even know?

354
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:01,981
I told him.

355
00:38:03,733 --> 00:38:04,734
What?

356
00:38:04,818 --> 00:38:07,112
I told him to go to Odin after we'd left.

357
00:38:07,195 --> 00:38:08,728
He should be flogged for taking so long.

358
00:38:08,738 --> 00:38:10,348
We should never have reached Jotunheim.

359
00:38:10,401 --> 00:38:11,282
You told the guard?

360
00:38:11,366 --> 00:38:12,909
I saved our lives.

361
00:38:13,535 --> 00:38:15,370
And Thor's.

362
00:38:15,453 --> 00:38:17,914
I had no idea Father would banish him
for what he did.

363
00:38:19,124 --> 00:38:20,124
Loki.

364
00:38:20,959 --> 00:38:23,742
You must go to the Allfather
and convince him to change his mind.

365
00:38:23,753 --> 00:38:25,839
And if I do, then what?

366
00:38:26,548 --> 00:38:29,801
I love Thor more dearly than any of you,
but you know what he is.

367
00:38:29,884 --> 00:38:32,512
He's arrogant. He's reckless.
He's dangerous.

368
00:38:32,595 --> 00:38:34,556
You saw how he was today.

369
00:38:34,889 --> 00:38:36,629
Is that what Asgard needs from its king?

370
00:38:41,229 --> 00:38:45,859
He may speak of the good of Asgard,
but he's always been jealous of Thor.

371
00:38:46,818 --> 00:38:49,028
We should be grateful to him,
he saved our lives.

372
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,739
Laufey said

373
00:38:51,322 --> 00:38:53,742
there were traitors in the House of Odin.

374
00:38:54,576 --> 00:38:58,663
A master of magic could bring
three Jotuns into Asgard.

375
00:39:00,457 --> 00:39:02,167
Loki's always been one for mischief,

376
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,669
but you're talking
about something else entirely.

377
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:26,524
<i>Stop!</i>

378
00:39:30,195 --> 00:39:31,696
Am I cursed?

379
00:39:32,155 --> 00:39:33,198
<i>No.</i>

380
00:39:37,368 --> 00:39:38,578
What am I?

381
00:39:39,704 --> 00:39:40,872
You're my son.

382
00:39:51,382 --> 00:39:53,092
What more than that?

383
00:39:57,972 --> 00:40:00,975
The Casket wasn't the only thing
you took from Jotunheim that day,

384
00:40:01,059 --> 00:40:02,060
was it?

385
00:40:08,483 --> 00:40:09,818
No.

386
00:40:11,945 --> 00:40:13,293
In the aftermath of the battle,

387
00:40:13,303 --> 00:40:16,181
I went into the temple and I found a baby.

388
00:40:20,411 --> 00:40:23,248
<i>Small for a giant's offspring.</i>

389
00:40:23,832 --> 00:40:26,584
<i>Abandoned, suffering, left to die.</i>

390
00:40:27,752 --> 00:40:29,045
<i>Laufey's son.</i>

391
00:40:31,089 --> 00:40:32,757
Laufey's son.

392
00:40:36,511 --> 00:40:37,512
Yes.

393
00:40:41,182 --> 00:40:42,183
Why?

394
00:40:42,767 --> 00:40:45,937
You were knee-deep in Jotun blood,
why would you take me?

395
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,480
You were an innocent child.

396
00:40:47,564 --> 00:40:51,401
No. You took me for a purpose.
What was it?

397
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,198
Tell me!

398
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:01,786
I thought we could unite
our kingdoms one day.

399
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:05,206
Bring about an alliance,
bring about permanent peace.

400
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:06,708
Through you.

401
00:41:07,125 --> 00:41:08,251
What?

402
00:41:09,127 --> 00:41:11,379
But those plans no longer matter.

403
00:41:13,131 --> 00:41:16,217
So I am no more than another stolen relic,

404
00:41:16,676 --> 00:41:18,887
locked up here
until you might have use of me.

405
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:20,471
Why do you twist my words?

406
00:41:20,555 --> 00:41:22,816
You could have told me what I was
from the beginning,

407
00:41:22,826 --> 00:41:23,827
why didn't you?

408
00:41:24,017 --> 00:41:25,059
You're my son.

409
00:41:25,643 --> 00:41:28,229
I wanted only to protect you
from the truth.

410
00:41:28,313 --> 00:41:30,815
What? Because I'm the monster

411
00:41:30,899 --> 00:41:32,984
parents tell their children about
at night?

412
00:41:33,484 --> 00:41:35,398
- No, no.
- You know, it all makes sense now!

413
00:41:35,408 --> 00:41:37,989
Why you favored Thor all these years!

414
00:41:38,072 --> 00:41:40,909
Because no matter how much
you claim to love me,

415
00:41:41,534 --> 00:41:44,621
you could never have a Frost Giant
sitting on the throne of Asgard!

416
00:42:04,682 --> 00:42:06,100
Guards!

417
00:42:06,851 --> 00:42:08,811
Guards, please, help!

418
00:42:14,859 --> 00:42:16,611
<i>How'd you get inside that cloud?</i>

419
00:42:17,028 --> 00:42:19,364
Also, how could you eat
an entire box of Pop-Tarts

420
00:42:19,447 --> 00:42:20,949
and still be this hungry?

421
00:42:26,788 --> 00:42:29,207
- This drink, I like it.
- I know. It's great, right?

422
00:42:29,290 --> 00:42:30,458
Another!

423
00:42:31,793 --> 00:42:33,920
Sorry, Izzy. Little accident.

424
00:42:37,215 --> 00:42:39,433
- What was that?
- It was delicious. I want another.

425
00:42:39,517 --> 00:42:41,648
- Well, you could have just said so.
- I just did.

426
00:42:41,658 --> 00:42:44,430
- No, I mean, ask nicely.
- I meant no disrespect.

427
00:42:44,514 --> 00:42:46,099
All right. Well, no more smashing.

428
00:42:46,683 --> 00:42:47,683
Deal?

429
00:42:50,311 --> 00:42:51,311
You have my word.

430
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,481
Good.

431
00:42:54,983 --> 00:42:56,651
<i>The usual, please, Izzy.</i>

432
00:42:56,734 --> 00:42:59,487
<i>You missed all the excitement
out at the crater.</i>

433
00:42:59,570 --> 00:43:02,824
<i>They're saying some kind of satellite
landed out in the desert.</i>

434
00:43:02,907 --> 00:43:05,284
<i>Yeah,
we were having a good time with it</i>

435
00:43:05,368 --> 00:43:06,744
<i>until the Feds showed up.</i>

436
00:43:06,828 --> 00:43:09,497
Excuse me.
Did you say there was a satellite crash?

437
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:10,580
<i>Yeah.</i>

438
00:43:10,873 --> 00:43:13,084
Oh, my God. This is going on Facebook.
Smile.

439
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:17,422
What did it look like, the satellite?

440
00:43:17,505 --> 00:43:21,175
Well, I don't know anything
about satellites, but it was heavy.

441
00:43:22,051 --> 00:43:24,595
<i>I mean, nobody could lift it.</i>

442
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,141
<i>They said it was radioactive.
I had my hands all over it.</i>

443
00:43:28,558 --> 00:43:30,059
Which way?

444
00:43:30,143 --> 00:43:32,145
Oh, uh...

445
00:43:32,228 --> 00:43:34,230
Fifty miles west of here.

446
00:43:34,731 --> 00:43:36,315
Well, I wouldn't waste my time!

447
00:43:36,399 --> 00:43:38,573
<i>Looked like the whole Army
was coming when we left.</i>

448
00:43:43,239 --> 00:43:44,574
<i>Dumbass!</i>

449
00:43:45,658 --> 00:43:46,743
Where are you going?

450
00:43:47,035 --> 00:43:49,162
- Fifty miles west of here.
- Why?

451
00:43:49,245 --> 00:43:52,623
- To get what belongs to me.
- Oh, so you own a satellite now?

452
00:43:52,707 --> 00:43:53,781
It's not what they say it is.

453
00:43:53,791 --> 00:43:54,834
Well, whatever it is,

454
00:43:54,917 --> 00:43:56,700
the government seems to think it's theirs.

455
00:43:56,783 --> 00:43:58,783
So, you just intend to go in there
and take it?

456
00:43:58,793 --> 00:43:59,793
Yes.

457
00:44:00,882 --> 00:44:02,175
If you take me there now,

458
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:04,377
I'll tell you everything you wish to know.

459
00:44:04,387 --> 00:44:05,387
- Everything?
- Yes.

460
00:44:05,428 --> 00:44:08,222
All the answers you seek will be yours
once I reclaim Mjolnir.

461
00:44:08,306 --> 00:44:10,391
Myeu-muh? What's Myeu-muh?

462
00:44:10,641 --> 00:44:12,101
Can I have a word, Jane?

463
00:44:16,606 --> 00:44:18,191
Please don't do this.

464
00:44:18,441 --> 00:44:20,318
You saw what I saw last night.

465
00:44:20,401 --> 00:44:22,727
This is no coincidence.
We have to find out what's in that crater.

466
00:44:22,737 --> 00:44:25,303
But I'm not talking about the crater,
I'm talking about him.

467
00:44:25,313 --> 00:44:27,492
- But he's promising us answers.
- He's delusional.

468
00:44:27,575 --> 00:44:28,749
<i>Listen to what he's saying.</i>

469
00:44:28,759 --> 00:44:32,346
He's talking about Mjolnir
and Thor and Bifrost.

470
00:44:33,122 --> 00:44:35,124
It's the stories
I grew up with as a child.

471
00:44:35,208 --> 00:44:37,960
I'm just going to drive him. That's it.

472
00:44:38,461 --> 00:44:40,379
He's dangerous, Jane.

473
00:44:46,385 --> 00:44:49,138
I'm sorry, but I can't take you.

474
00:44:49,222 --> 00:44:50,723
Then this is where we say goodbye.

475
00:44:57,522 --> 00:44:58,523
Um...

476
00:45:01,317 --> 00:45:02,819
Thank you?

477
00:45:03,736 --> 00:45:05,071
Jane Foster,

478
00:45:05,571 --> 00:45:06,864
Erik Selvig,

479
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,407
Darcy,

480
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:10,118
farewell.

481
00:45:13,913 --> 00:45:15,248
All right.

482
00:45:15,915 --> 00:45:17,500
Back to work.

483
00:45:36,352 --> 00:45:37,854
Hey!

484
00:45:37,937 --> 00:45:39,522
That's my stuff!

485
00:45:44,193 --> 00:45:45,541
What the hell is going on here?

486
00:45:45,611 --> 00:45:47,520
Ms. Foster,
I'm Agent Coulson with S.H.I.E.L.D.

487
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:49,323
Is that supposed to mean something to me?

488
00:45:49,407 --> 00:45:50,581
- You can't do this!
- Jane!

489
00:45:50,992 --> 00:45:53,786
Jane, this is a lot more serious
than you realize. Let it go.

490
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:55,872
Let it go? This is my life.

491
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:58,416
We're investigating a security threat.

492
00:45:58,499 --> 00:46:01,326
We need to appropriate your records
and all your atmospheric data.

493
00:46:01,336 --> 00:46:03,713
By "appropriate," do you mean steal?

494
00:46:03,796 --> 00:46:05,579
Here, this should more than compensate you

495
00:46:05,589 --> 00:46:06,424
for your trouble.

496
00:46:06,507 --> 00:46:09,135
I can't just buy replacements
at Radio Shack,

497
00:46:09,218 --> 00:46:11,053
I made most of this equipment myself!

498
00:46:11,137 --> 00:46:12,616
Then I'm sure you can do it again.

499
00:46:12,626 --> 00:46:15,516
And I'm sure I can sue you
for violating my constitutional rights!

500
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:18,144
I'm sorry, Ms. Foster,
but we're the good guys.

501
00:46:18,227 --> 00:46:19,854
So are we!

502
00:46:20,188 --> 00:46:23,566
I'm on the verge of understanding
something extraordinary.

503
00:46:23,649 --> 00:46:25,484
And everything I know
about this phenomenon

504
00:46:25,568 --> 00:46:27,570
is either in this lab or in this book.

505
00:46:27,653 --> 00:46:30,281
And you can't just take this away... Hey!

506
00:46:30,698 --> 00:46:34,243
Jane! Easy! Easy. Jane...

507
00:46:36,662 --> 00:46:38,372
Thank you for your cooperation.

508
00:46:56,349 --> 00:46:57,642
Years of research,

509
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,100
gone.

510
00:46:59,685 --> 00:47:01,479
They even took my iPod.

511
00:47:02,271 --> 00:47:04,857
- What about the backups?
- They took our backups.

512
00:47:05,149 --> 00:47:08,694
They took the backups of our backups.
They were extremely thorough.

513
00:47:08,778 --> 00:47:11,113
I just downloaded, like,
30 songs onto there.

514
00:47:11,197 --> 00:47:13,699
Could you please stop with your iPod?

515
00:47:14,617 --> 00:47:16,702
Who are these people?

516
00:47:18,246 --> 00:47:20,248
I knew this scientist.

517
00:47:20,665 --> 00:47:23,251
The pioneer in gamma radiation.

518
00:47:23,334 --> 00:47:25,544
S.H.I.E.L.D. showed up and, uh...

519
00:47:26,796 --> 00:47:28,381
he wasn't heard from again.

520
00:47:29,423 --> 00:47:32,718
They're not gonna do that to us.
I'm gonna get everything back.

521
00:47:32,802 --> 00:47:35,471
Come on, please.
Let me contact one of my colleagues.

522
00:47:35,554 --> 00:47:37,598
He's had some dealings
with these people before.

523
00:47:38,266 --> 00:47:40,893
I'll e-mail him and maybe he can help.

524
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:42,895
They took your laptop, too.

525
00:47:51,904 --> 00:47:55,074
Allfather,
we must speak with you urgently.

526
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,839
My friends.

527
00:48:10,381 --> 00:48:11,549
Where's Odin?

528
00:48:12,174 --> 00:48:15,094
Father has fallen into the Odinsleep.

529
00:48:16,595 --> 00:48:19,098
Mother fears he may never awaken again.

530
00:48:19,765 --> 00:48:20,809
We would speak with her.

531
00:48:20,891 --> 00:48:24,353
She has refused to leave
my father's bedside.

532
00:48:26,605 --> 00:48:29,358
You can bring your urgent matter to me.

533
00:48:36,782 --> 00:48:38,117
Your king.

534
00:48:49,337 --> 00:48:53,632
My King, we would ask
that you end Thor's banishment.

535
00:48:58,304 --> 00:49:01,640
My first command
cannot be to undo the Allfather's last.

536
00:49:04,477 --> 00:49:07,021
We're on the brink of war with Jotunheim.

537
00:49:08,189 --> 00:49:10,900
Our people need a sense of continuity,

538
00:49:10,983 --> 00:49:13,819
in order to feel safe
in these difficult times.

539
00:49:15,154 --> 00:49:16,697
All of us must stand together

540
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:19,367
for the good of Asgard.

541
00:49:21,911 --> 00:49:23,412
Yes, of course.

542
00:49:23,662 --> 00:49:26,582
- Good. Then you will wait for my word.
- If I may...

543
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:32,838
beg the indulgence of Your Majesty
to perhaps reconsider...

544
00:49:32,922 --> 00:49:34,215
We're done!

545
00:50:38,112 --> 00:50:39,113
I need a horse!

546
00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:44,535
We don't have horses.
Just dogs, cats, birds...

547
00:50:44,618 --> 00:50:46,618
Then give me one of those
large enough to ride.

548
00:50:46,628 --> 00:50:49,589
Hey, you still need a lift?

549
00:50:54,462 --> 00:50:57,131
I've never done anything like this before.

550
00:50:58,424 --> 00:51:01,218
Have you ever done
anything like this before?

551
00:51:01,969 --> 00:51:03,471
Many times.

552
00:51:04,263 --> 00:51:05,598
But you're brave to do it.

553
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:07,975
Well, they just stole
my entire life's work.

554
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:10,436
I don't really have much left to lose.

555
00:51:11,812 --> 00:51:12,856
Yeah, but you're clever.

556
00:51:12,866 --> 00:51:13,772
Hmm, thanks.

557
00:51:13,856 --> 00:51:16,567
Far more clever than anyone else
in this realm.

558
00:51:17,026 --> 00:51:19,278
"Realm"? "Realm"?

559
00:51:19,862 --> 00:51:22,615
- You think me strange.
- Yeah, I do.

560
00:51:23,157 --> 00:51:25,284
Good strange or bad strange?

561
00:51:25,743 --> 00:51:27,286
I'm not quite sure yet.

562
00:51:32,666 --> 00:51:34,335
I'm sorry.

563
00:51:39,465 --> 00:51:40,465
But who are you?

564
00:51:42,843 --> 00:51:44,178
Really?

565
00:51:46,722 --> 00:51:48,015
You'll see soon enough.

566
00:51:49,058 --> 00:51:50,518
You promised me answers.

567
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:55,940
What you seek, it's a bridge.

568
00:51:56,398 --> 00:51:58,234
Like an Einstein-Rosen Bridge?

569
00:51:58,317 --> 00:51:59,527
More like a Rainbow Bridge.

570
00:52:02,863 --> 00:52:04,573
God, I hope you're not crazy.

571
00:52:14,875 --> 00:52:17,253
<i>I never get used to seeing him
like this.</i>

572
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:22,216
He's put it off for so long now,
that I fear...

573
00:52:24,718 --> 00:52:26,136
How long will it last?

574
00:52:26,887 --> 00:52:31,016
<i>I don't know. This time it's different.
We were unprepared.</i>

575
00:52:33,394 --> 00:52:34,812
So why did he lie?

576
00:52:35,896 --> 00:52:39,817
He kept the truth from you
so that you would never feel different.

577
00:52:40,234 --> 00:52:42,570
<i>You are our son, Loki,</i>

578
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:45,197
<i>and we, your family.</i>

579
00:52:46,824 --> 00:52:51,078
We mustn't lose hope
that your father will return to us.

580
00:52:52,246 --> 00:52:53,664
And your brother.

581
00:52:55,124 --> 00:52:56,959
What hope is there for Thor?

582
00:52:57,251 --> 00:53:00,713
There's always a purpose
to everything your father does.

583
00:53:33,579 --> 00:53:34,964
<i>That's no satellite crash!</i>

584
00:53:35,047 --> 00:53:36,987
<i>They would have hauled
the wreckage away,</i>

585
00:53:36,997 --> 00:53:39,024
<i>they wouldn't have built
a city around it.</i>

586
00:53:39,627 --> 00:53:43,088
- You're going to need this.
- What? Wait, why?

587
00:53:46,467 --> 00:53:47,801
Now stay here.

588
00:53:48,052 --> 00:53:48,931
Once I have Mjolnir,

589
00:53:48,942 --> 00:53:51,315
I will return the items
they've stolen from you.

590
00:53:52,014 --> 00:53:53,014
Deal?

591
00:53:53,265 --> 00:53:55,726
No. Look what's down there.

592
00:53:55,809 --> 00:53:58,687
You think you're just gonna walk in,
grab our stuff and walk out?

593
00:53:58,771 --> 00:54:00,689
No. I'm going to fly out.

594
00:54:08,739 --> 00:54:11,679
<i>Sir, feed from the keyhole
can barely penetrate the cloud cover.</i>

595
00:54:11,784 --> 00:54:13,132
Tech's barely working as it is,

596
00:54:13,142 --> 00:54:15,273
with all the interference
that thing's giving off.

597
00:54:15,829 --> 00:54:18,464
<i>And we've got a commercial aircraft
coming right over us.</i>

598
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:21,456
<i>Southwest Airlines, flight 5434.</i>

599
00:54:21,502 --> 00:54:22,850
Reroute it like all the others.

600
00:54:24,004 --> 00:54:25,004
Hold a sec.

601
00:54:25,047 --> 00:54:27,800
<i>We've got something outside the fence,
west side.</i>

602
00:54:27,883 --> 00:54:31,470
<i>Delancey, Jackson. West side perimeter.
Go check it out.</i>

603
00:54:33,972 --> 00:54:34,973
There it is.

604
00:54:44,066 --> 00:54:45,567
Delancey, Jackson. Report.

605
00:54:54,034 --> 00:54:55,969
<i>Agent down.
We've got a perimeter breach.</i>

606
00:55:08,924 --> 00:55:13,053
<i>You've reached Dr. Erik Selvig.
Please leave me a message.</i>

607
00:55:13,846 --> 00:55:16,473
Hi, Erik, it's me.
Don't worry, I'm fine, but...

608
00:55:17,391 --> 00:55:19,768
just in case you don't hear from me
in the next hour,

609
00:55:20,144 --> 00:55:22,563
just come by the crater site
and try and find me, okay?

610
00:55:22,646 --> 00:55:25,357
I did exactly what you told me not to.
I'm sorry.

611
00:55:25,899 --> 00:55:27,401
So sorry. Bye.

612
00:55:31,238 --> 00:55:32,364
Bravo quadrant, move!

613
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:47,880
<i>Entering south tunnel!</i>

614
00:55:49,298 --> 00:55:51,120
<i>Negative, negative. I have no comms.</i>

615
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:06,732
<i>Target sighted, east tunnel!</i>

616
00:56:06,982 --> 00:56:08,567
I need eyes up high, with a gun.

617
00:56:34,426 --> 00:56:35,719
Moving north!

618
00:56:43,644 --> 00:56:44,520
What have we got?

619
00:56:44,603 --> 00:56:46,256
There's a massive electromagnetic surge

620
00:56:46,340 --> 00:56:47,297
coming off that thing.

621
00:56:47,307 --> 00:56:49,115
Systems are barely coping.

622
00:56:49,441 --> 00:56:51,151
Barton? Talk to me.

623
00:56:52,611 --> 00:56:54,196
You want me to slow him down, sir?

624
00:56:55,447 --> 00:56:57,621
Or are you sending in more guys
for him to beat up?

625
00:56:57,908 --> 00:56:59,368
I'll let you know.

626
00:57:14,216 --> 00:57:15,551
You're big.

627
00:57:16,677 --> 00:57:18,053
Fought bigger.

628
00:58:02,347 --> 00:58:05,934
Better call it, Coulson,
'cause I'm starting to root for this guy.

629
00:58:26,997 --> 00:58:27,997
Last chance, sir.

630
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:30,000
<i>Wait. I want to see this.</i>

631
00:59:39,277 --> 00:59:41,571
All right, show's over.
Ground units, move in.

632
01:00:34,916 --> 01:00:36,793
<i>He committed a crime. He's in jail!</i>

633
01:00:36,877 --> 01:00:39,171
<i>- I can't just leave him there!
- Why?</i>

634
01:00:39,254 --> 01:00:41,465
You didn't see what I saw!

635
01:00:41,715 --> 01:00:43,759
Look! Look, it's Myeu-muh.

636
01:00:48,388 --> 01:00:49,598
Where'd you find this?

637
01:00:49,681 --> 01:00:51,016
The children's section.

638
01:00:51,099 --> 01:00:53,351
I just wanted to show you
how silly his story was.

639
01:00:53,435 --> 01:00:55,520
But you're the one who's always pushing me

640
01:00:55,604 --> 01:00:57,778
to chase down every possibility,
every alternative!

641
01:00:57,856 --> 01:00:59,900
I'm talking about science, not magic!

642
01:00:59,983 --> 01:01:02,444
Well, magic's just science
that we don't understand yet.

643
01:01:02,527 --> 01:01:04,905
- Arthur C. Clarke.
- Who wrote science fiction.

644
01:01:04,988 --> 01:01:07,699
- A precursor to science fact!
- In some cases, yeah.

645
01:01:07,783 --> 01:01:09,399
Well, if there is
an Einstein-Rosen Bridge,

646
01:01:09,409 --> 01:01:11,149
then there's something on the other side.

647
01:01:11,233 --> 01:01:13,016
And advanced beings could have crossed it!

648
01:01:13,026 --> 01:01:13,826
Oh, Jane.

649
01:01:13,830 --> 01:01:17,048
A primitive culture like the Vikings
might have worshipped them as deities.

650
01:01:17,058 --> 01:01:18,668
Yes! Yes, exactly. Thank you.

651
01:01:18,752 --> 01:01:20,378
Mmm-hmm.

652
01:01:26,593 --> 01:01:28,519
<i>You made my men, some of the most...</i>

653
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:30,552
<i>Highly trained professionals
in the world,</i>

654
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:33,313
<i>look like a bunch
of minimum-wage mall cops.</i>

655
01:01:34,976 --> 01:01:36,103
That's hurtful.

656
01:01:37,312 --> 01:01:40,774
In my experience, it takes someone
who's received similar training

657
01:01:41,233 --> 01:01:42,484
to do what you did to them.

658
01:01:43,944 --> 01:01:46,446
Why don't you tell me
where you received your training?

659
01:01:46,696 --> 01:01:50,117
Pakistan? Chechnya? Afghanistan?

660
01:01:51,451 --> 01:01:54,496
No, you strike me more
as the soldier of fortune type.

661
01:01:55,622 --> 01:01:58,583
Where was it? South Africa?

662
01:02:00,085 --> 01:02:04,005
Certain groups pay very well
for a good mercenary like you.

663
01:02:06,341 --> 01:02:07,509
Who are you?

664
01:02:12,681 --> 01:02:15,142
One way or another,
we find out what we need to know.

665
01:02:15,517 --> 01:02:16,643
We're good at that.

666
01:02:22,524 --> 01:02:23,608
Don't go anywhere.

667
01:02:30,365 --> 01:02:32,868
Loki! What are you doing here?

668
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:34,369
I had to see you.

669
01:02:36,371 --> 01:02:37,706
What's happened?

670
01:02:38,039 --> 01:02:40,041
Tell me. Is it Jotunheim?

671
01:02:40,375 --> 01:02:41,585
Let me explain to Father.

672
01:02:41,668 --> 01:02:43,128
Father is dead.

673
01:02:49,384 --> 01:02:50,635
What?

674
01:02:52,554 --> 01:02:54,139
Your banishment,

675
01:02:55,140 --> 01:02:57,392
the threat of a new war,

676
01:02:58,351 --> 01:03:00,020
it was too much for him to bear.

677
01:03:02,898 --> 01:03:04,691
You mustn't blame yourself.

678
01:03:05,775 --> 01:03:07,569
I know that you loved him.

679
01:03:08,195 --> 01:03:10,572
I tried to tell him so,
but he wouldn't listen.

680
01:03:13,325 --> 01:03:15,543
It was so cruel
to put the hammer within your reach,

681
01:03:15,553 --> 01:03:17,639
knowing that you could never lift it.

682
01:03:20,916 --> 01:03:23,043
The burden of the throne
has fallen to me now.

683
01:03:29,758 --> 01:03:31,509
Can I come home?

684
01:03:32,385 --> 01:03:35,388
The truce with Jotunheim
is conditional upon your exile.

685
01:03:35,722 --> 01:03:41,478
- Yes, but couldn't we find a way...
- And Mother has forbidden your return.

686
01:03:44,981 --> 01:03:46,775
This is goodbye, Brother.

687
01:03:49,236 --> 01:03:50,904
I'm so sorry.

688
01:03:56,743 --> 01:03:57,911
No.

689
01:03:59,412 --> 01:04:01,081
I am sorry.

690
01:04:06,461 --> 01:04:08,755
Thank you for coming here.

691
01:04:13,260 --> 01:04:14,594
Farewell.

692
01:04:27,482 --> 01:04:28,942
Goodbye.

693
01:04:29,734 --> 01:04:30,777
Goodbye?

694
01:04:31,486 --> 01:04:32,779
I just got back.

695
01:05:08,815 --> 01:05:09,816
Sir?

696
01:05:10,775 --> 01:05:11,985
He's got a visitor.

697
01:05:17,324 --> 01:05:19,075
His name is Donald Blake?

698
01:05:19,492 --> 01:05:21,077
Dr. Donald Blake.

699
01:05:21,161 --> 01:05:23,121
You have dangerous coworkers, Dr. Selvig.

700
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:27,000
He was distraught when he found out
that you've taken all of our research.

701
01:05:27,834 --> 01:05:30,337
That was years of his life, gone!

702
01:05:32,297 --> 01:05:34,515
You can understand
how a man could go off like that.

703
01:05:35,008 --> 01:05:37,135
A big, faceless organization like yours

704
01:05:37,218 --> 01:05:39,095
coming in with their jackbooted thugs
and...

705
01:05:41,348 --> 01:05:42,640
That's how he put it.

706
01:05:42,724 --> 01:05:43,855
That still doesn't explain

707
01:05:43,865 --> 01:05:45,735
how he managed
to tear through our security.

708
01:05:46,019 --> 01:05:49,314
Steroids! He's a bit of a fitness nut.

709
01:05:50,857 --> 01:05:52,025
Sir?

710
01:05:56,863 --> 01:05:58,168
It says here that he's an M.D.

711
01:05:58,406 --> 01:06:00,742
Well, he is! Or he was.

712
01:06:00,825 --> 01:06:03,328
He switched careers
and became a physicist.

713
01:06:03,870 --> 01:06:05,038
A brilliant physicist.

714
01:06:05,121 --> 01:06:07,540
He's a wonderful man. He's a man in pain.

715
01:06:10,210 --> 01:06:12,837
<i>Oh, Donny, Donny, Donny!</i>

716
01:06:13,421 --> 01:06:17,384
There you are. It's gonna be all right.
I'm taking you home now.

717
01:06:31,898 --> 01:06:33,400
Dr. Selvig!

718
01:06:34,442 --> 01:06:36,903
Just keep him away from the bars.

719
01:06:37,404 --> 01:06:38,738
I will!

720
01:06:40,573 --> 01:06:43,159
- Where are we going?
- To get a drink.

721
01:06:43,743 --> 01:06:44,994
Follow them.

722
01:06:51,543 --> 01:06:53,711
You know, I had it all backwards.

723
01:06:55,755 --> 01:06:57,132
I had it all wrong.

724
01:07:00,635 --> 01:07:04,305
It's not a bad thing finding out
that you don't have all the answers.

725
01:07:04,764 --> 01:07:06,474
You start asking the right questions.

726
01:07:10,770 --> 01:07:14,732
For the first time in my life,

727
01:07:14,816 --> 01:07:19,487
I have no idea what I'm supposed to do.

728
01:07:20,488 --> 01:07:23,199
Anyone who's ever going
to find his way in this world

729
01:07:23,450 --> 01:07:26,536
has to start by admitting
he doesn't know where the hell he is.

730
01:07:28,621 --> 01:07:30,039
Thank you for what you've done.

731
01:07:30,123 --> 01:07:32,625
No, don't thank me.
I only did it for Jane.

732
01:07:34,294 --> 01:07:36,963
Her father and I taught
at university together.

733
01:07:37,297 --> 01:07:38,923
He was a good man.

734
01:07:39,924 --> 01:07:40,924
He never listened.

735
01:07:42,302 --> 01:07:43,928
Neither did I.

736
01:07:45,138 --> 01:07:47,223
My father was trying to teach me
something,

737
01:07:47,307 --> 01:07:49,184
but I was too stupid to see it.

738
01:07:50,310 --> 01:07:54,355
I don't know if you're delusional
or if you're pulling some kind of con,

739
01:07:54,439 --> 01:07:55,565
and I don't care.

740
01:07:55,899 --> 01:07:57,025
I just care about her.

741
01:07:58,526 --> 01:08:00,653
I've seen the way she looks at you.

742
01:08:04,324 --> 01:08:06,659
I swear to you, I mean her no harm.

743
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,161
Good.

744
01:08:08,828 --> 01:08:12,707
In that case, I'll buy you another round,
and you leave town tonight.

745
01:08:18,004 --> 01:08:19,797
Two boilermakers.

746
01:09:11,432 --> 01:09:12,684
Kill him.

747
01:09:14,519 --> 01:09:16,479
After all I've done for you?

748
01:09:18,940 --> 01:09:23,528
So you're the one who showed us
the way into Asgard.

749
01:09:23,945 --> 01:09:26,114
That was just a bit of fun, really.

750
01:09:27,282 --> 01:09:30,285
To ruin my brother's big day.

751
01:09:31,160 --> 01:09:34,914
And to protect the realm
from his idiotic rule for a while longer.

752
01:09:36,249 --> 01:09:38,585
I will hear you.

753
01:09:41,963 --> 01:09:46,384
I will conceal you
and a handful of your soldiers,

754
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:52,140
lead you into Odin's chambers,
and you can slay him where he lies.

755
01:09:52,557 --> 01:09:54,142
Why not kill him yourself?

756
01:09:56,227 --> 01:09:59,022
I suspect that
the Asgardians would not take kindly

757
01:09:59,105 --> 01:10:01,316
to a king who had murdered
his predecessor.

758
01:10:02,567 --> 01:10:05,445
Once Odin is dead,
I will return the Casket to you

759
01:10:07,655 --> 01:10:10,658
and you can return Jotunheim to all its...

760
01:10:13,494 --> 01:10:14,746
Glory.

761
01:10:16,205 --> 01:10:17,498
I...

762
01:10:19,125 --> 01:10:20,543
Accept.

763
01:10:26,674 --> 01:10:28,217
What troubles you, Gatekeeper?

764
01:10:28,509 --> 01:10:33,514
I turned my gaze upon you in Jotunheim,
but could neither see you nor hear you.

765
01:10:34,182 --> 01:10:35,433
You were shrouded from me,

766
01:10:35,516 --> 01:10:37,644
like the Frost Giants
that entered this realm.

767
01:10:38,019 --> 01:10:41,397
Perhaps your senses have weakened
after your many years of service.

768
01:10:41,481 --> 01:10:43,107
Or perhaps someone has found a way

769
01:10:43,191 --> 01:10:46,235
to hide that
which he does not wish me to see.

770
01:10:47,528 --> 01:10:49,572
You have great power, Heimdall.

771
01:10:52,158 --> 01:10:53,576
Did Odin ever fear you?

772
01:10:55,870 --> 01:10:57,538
- No.
- And why is that?

773
01:10:57,830 --> 01:11:00,833
Because he is my king
and I am sworn to obey him.

774
01:11:01,209 --> 01:11:05,380
He was your king
and you're sworn to obey me now.

775
01:11:06,381 --> 01:11:07,381
Yes?

776
01:11:12,637 --> 01:11:13,637
Yes.

777
01:11:14,847 --> 01:11:17,433
Then you will open the Bifrost to no one

778
01:11:17,684 --> 01:11:20,520
until I have repaired the damage
that my brother has done.

779
01:11:35,118 --> 01:11:37,245
Oh, my God. Is he okay?

780
01:11:37,578 --> 01:11:39,372
He's fine. Not injured at all.

781
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:42,041
I'm sorry, my friend.

782
01:11:42,125 --> 01:11:43,960
- What happened?
- We drank, we fought,

783
01:11:44,043 --> 01:11:45,545
he made his ancestors proud.

784
01:11:45,628 --> 01:11:47,839
Ah, put him on the bed.

785
01:11:55,638 --> 01:11:57,181
Okay.

786
01:11:58,891 --> 01:12:02,353
I still don't think
you're the God of Thunder.

787
01:12:03,271 --> 01:12:05,440
But you ought to be.

788
01:12:16,576 --> 01:12:17,952
Are these your chamber?

789
01:12:18,453 --> 01:12:21,789
Uh, it's more
of a temporary living situation.

790
01:12:21,873 --> 01:12:22,874
Oh.

791
01:12:22,957 --> 01:12:26,878
I'm sorry. I don't usually have guests.

792
01:12:27,503 --> 01:12:30,339
Actually, um, I never have guests.

793
01:12:32,467 --> 01:12:34,719
That's not the right place for it.

794
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:37,346
I'm sorry, um...

795
01:12:40,349 --> 01:12:41,392
Can we go outside?

796
01:12:42,310 --> 01:12:43,686
Yes, of course.

797
01:12:49,275 --> 01:12:51,486
I come up here sometimes
when I can't sleep

798
01:12:51,569 --> 01:12:55,615
or I'm trying to reconcile particle data,
or when Darcy's driving me crazy.

799
01:12:56,908 --> 01:13:00,328
I come up here a lot, actually,
now that I think about it.

800
01:13:04,332 --> 01:13:06,292
I'm really glad you're safe.

801
01:13:07,376 --> 01:13:09,921
You've been very kind to me,

802
01:13:10,379 --> 01:13:12,590
and I've been far less grateful
than you deserve.

803
01:13:12,965 --> 01:13:14,792
Well, I hit you with my car
a couple times,

804
01:13:14,802 --> 01:13:16,930
so I think that kind of evens things out.

805
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:20,890
Perhaps I had it coming.

806
01:13:26,938 --> 01:13:28,272
Oh, my God!

807
01:13:29,482 --> 01:13:30,817
I don't believe it!

808
01:13:31,025 --> 01:13:34,445
It was all I could get back.
I'm sorry it's not as much as I promised.

809
01:13:34,529 --> 01:13:39,200
No, no, this is great! This is...
I don't have to start from scratch now.

810
01:13:39,534 --> 01:13:40,952
Thank you.

811
01:13:45,540 --> 01:13:46,916
What's wrong?

812
01:13:48,417 --> 01:13:49,252
S.H.I.E.L.D.

813
01:13:49,335 --> 01:13:50,711
Whatever they are,

814
01:13:52,338 --> 01:13:54,121
they're gonna do everything in their power

815
01:13:54,131 --> 01:13:56,592
to make sure this research
never sees the light of day.

816
01:13:56,676 --> 01:13:58,219
No, Jane.

817
01:13:58,845 --> 01:14:00,596
Listen to me. You must not give up.

818
01:14:01,013 --> 01:14:03,140
- You must finish what you've started.
- Why?

819
01:14:03,224 --> 01:14:04,642
Because you're right.

820
01:14:05,351 --> 01:14:06,686
Here, look.

821
01:14:09,230 --> 01:14:12,733
Your ancestors called it magic,
and you call it science.

822
01:14:13,359 --> 01:14:16,055
Well, I come from a place
where they're one and the same thing.

823
01:14:30,710 --> 01:14:32,253
What is that?

824
01:14:33,254 --> 01:14:36,424
My father... explained it to me like this,

825
01:14:36,799 --> 01:14:38,259
that your world

826
01:14:38,342 --> 01:14:41,178
is one of the Nine Realms of the Cosmos,

827
01:14:41,262 --> 01:14:44,140
linked to each other
by the branches of Yggdrasil,

828
01:14:44,223 --> 01:14:45,808
the Worlds Tree.

829
01:14:46,767 --> 01:14:49,478
Now you see it every day
without realizing.

830
01:14:49,854 --> 01:14:52,773
The images glimpsed through, uh,
what did you call it? This...

831
01:14:53,274 --> 01:14:54,984
This Hooble Telescope.

832
01:14:55,610 --> 01:14:58,112
- Hubble.
- Hubble Telescope.

833
01:15:01,574 --> 01:15:02,909
Tell me more.

834
01:15:03,451 --> 01:15:04,952
So, the Nine Realms.

835
01:15:05,620 --> 01:15:08,205
Now, there is Midgard, which is Earth.

836
01:15:08,456 --> 01:15:09,957
This is Alfheim.

837
01:15:10,291 --> 01:15:12,960
Vanaheim. Jotunheim.

838
01:15:13,794 --> 01:15:15,212
And Asgard.

839
01:15:15,671 --> 01:15:17,590
<i>And that's where I come from.</i>

840
01:15:34,982 --> 01:15:36,400
<i>Thank you, Jane.</i>

841
01:15:39,779 --> 01:15:42,740
Our dearest friend banished,
Loki on the throne,

842
01:15:42,823 --> 01:15:46,035
Asgard on the brink of war,
yet you've managed to consume

843
01:15:46,118 --> 01:15:49,413
four wild boar, six pheasant,
a side of beef,

844
01:15:49,497 --> 01:15:52,875
and two casks of ale. Shame on you.
Don't you care?

845
01:15:53,793 --> 01:15:55,920
Do not mistake my appetite for apathy!

846
01:15:56,128 --> 01:15:57,964
Stop it, both of you!

847
01:15:58,297 --> 01:15:59,297
Stop.

848
01:16:00,466 --> 01:16:02,969
- We all know what we have to do.
- We must go.

849
01:16:05,471 --> 01:16:07,473
We must find Thor.

850
01:16:09,141 --> 01:16:10,141
It's treason.

851
01:16:10,351 --> 01:16:12,019
To hell with treason, it's suicide.

852
01:16:12,436 --> 01:16:14,313
Thor would do the same for us.

853
01:16:15,481 --> 01:16:16,816
Now shush.

854
01:16:18,359 --> 01:16:20,528
Heimdall might be watching.

855
01:16:25,825 --> 01:16:28,327
Heimdall demands your presence.

856
01:16:32,832 --> 01:16:34,166
We're doomed.

857
01:16:34,250 --> 01:16:37,837
You would defy the commands of Loki,
our king,

858
01:16:38,504 --> 01:16:40,965
break every oath you have taken
as warriors,

859
01:16:41,048 --> 01:16:43,467
and commit treason to bring Thor back?

860
01:16:43,759 --> 01:16:45,052
- Yes.
- Good.

861
01:16:46,012 --> 01:16:47,013
So you'll help us?

862
01:16:47,096 --> 01:16:51,392
I am bound by honor to our king.
I cannot open the bridge to you.

863
01:16:52,601 --> 01:16:54,103
Complicated fellow, isn't he?

864
01:16:54,353 --> 01:16:56,022
Now what do we do?

865
01:16:57,314 --> 01:16:58,691
Look!

866
01:17:18,085 --> 01:17:19,493
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know, sir.

867
01:17:19,503 --> 01:17:20,870
We got massive energy
readings out of nowhere

868
01:17:20,880 --> 01:17:23,446
and then they just disappeared.
Fifteen miles due northwest.

869
01:17:23,456 --> 01:17:24,791
Let's go take a look.

870
01:17:49,784 --> 01:17:51,035
Thank you.

871
01:17:51,118 --> 01:17:53,079
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.

872
01:18:00,211 --> 01:18:02,838
<i>Base to Team 2,
we've got activity outside the town.</i>

873
01:18:02,922 --> 01:18:04,048
<i>Stay on your target.</i>

874
01:18:13,641 --> 01:18:15,893
Ensure my brother does not return.

875
01:18:19,814 --> 01:18:21,273
Destroy everything.

876
01:18:32,493 --> 01:18:33,828
Mom?

877
01:18:41,669 --> 01:18:43,712
Is there a Renaissance Fair in town?

878
01:18:43,796 --> 01:18:45,131
Call it in.

879
01:18:45,631 --> 01:18:46,632
Yeah.

880
01:18:48,843 --> 01:18:52,096
Base, we've got Xena, Jackie Chan
and Robin Hood.

881
01:18:52,847 --> 01:18:55,141
It's a beautiful theory, Jane.

882
01:18:55,850 --> 01:18:59,103
But you won't be able to convince
the scientific community of any of it.

883
01:18:59,186 --> 01:19:00,437
Not without hard evidence.

884
01:19:01,480 --> 01:19:02,480
Found you!

885
01:19:08,821 --> 01:19:10,489
My friends!

886
01:19:11,949 --> 01:19:14,034
This is good! This is good.

887
01:19:14,368 --> 01:19:15,494
I don't believe it.

888
01:19:15,703 --> 01:19:18,747
Oh, excuse me.
Lady Sif and the Warriors Three.

889
01:19:21,458 --> 01:19:22,918
My friends,

890
01:19:23,002 --> 01:19:25,421
I've never been happier to see anyone.

891
01:19:25,921 --> 01:19:27,423
But you should not have come.

892
01:19:29,550 --> 01:19:30,801
We're here to take you home.

893
01:19:32,261 --> 01:19:33,971
You know I can't go home.

894
01:19:36,265 --> 01:19:37,766
My father is...

895
01:19:38,893 --> 01:19:40,269
dead because of me.

896
01:19:40,978 --> 01:19:42,479
I must remain in exile.

897
01:19:43,189 --> 01:19:44,481
Thor,

898
01:19:44,857 --> 01:19:46,609
your father still lives.

899
01:20:01,749 --> 01:20:04,668
Tell me, Loki, how did you get
the Jotuns into Asgard?

900
01:20:05,377 --> 01:20:08,631
You think the Bifrost is the only way
in and out of this realm?

901
01:20:08,714 --> 01:20:10,454
There are secret paths between the worlds

902
01:20:10,464 --> 01:20:12,718
to which even you, with all your gifts,
are blind.

903
01:20:12,801 --> 01:20:16,055
But I have need of them no longer,
now that I am king.

904
01:20:16,138 --> 01:20:17,806
And I say, for your act of treason,

905
01:20:17,890 --> 01:20:20,851
you are relieved of your duties
as Gatekeeper,

906
01:20:20,935 --> 01:20:22,811
and no longer citizen of Asgard.

907
01:20:23,395 --> 01:20:25,814
Then I need no longer obey you.

908
01:20:46,543 --> 01:20:48,462
Get somebody from Linguistics down here.

909
01:21:16,532 --> 01:21:18,075
Was somebody else coming?

910
01:21:22,288 --> 01:21:23,706
Is that one of Stark's?

911
01:21:23,789 --> 01:21:27,334
I don't know.
The guy never tells me anything.

912
01:21:31,130 --> 01:21:32,298
<i>Hello.</i>

913
01:21:32,381 --> 01:21:35,092
<i>You are using
unregistered weapons technology.</i>

914
01:21:35,175 --> 01:21:36,260
<i>Identify yourself.</i>

915
01:21:40,139 --> 01:21:41,140
Here we go.

916
01:21:44,643 --> 01:21:45,853
Incoming!

917
01:21:53,485 --> 01:21:54,903
Jane, you have to leave.

918
01:21:54,987 --> 01:21:56,989
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm staying here.

919
01:21:57,281 --> 01:21:58,949
Thor's going to fight with us!

920
01:21:59,325 --> 01:22:00,659
My friends,

921
01:22:01,243 --> 01:22:02,502
I'm just a man.

922
01:22:02,613 --> 01:22:05,090
I'll only be in the way, or worse,
get one of you killed.

923
01:22:05,164 --> 01:22:07,207
But I can help get these people to safety.

924
01:22:07,499 --> 01:22:09,543
Well, if you're staying, then so am I.

925
01:22:10,127 --> 01:22:12,087
- We'll need some time.
- You'll have it!

926
01:22:12,796 --> 01:22:14,256
Okay, move it, people!

927
01:22:15,174 --> 01:22:17,343
Everybody out! Use the back door.

928
01:22:17,801 --> 01:22:19,094
Go, hurry! You can eat later.

929
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:33,901
Keep it distracted.

930
01:22:48,582 --> 01:22:51,043
For Asgard!

931
01:23:26,412 --> 01:23:27,412
Fall back!

932
01:23:43,804 --> 01:23:45,055
Go. Now. Run!

933
01:24:13,417 --> 01:24:15,919
Sif. Sif, you've done all you can.

934
01:24:16,003 --> 01:24:18,297
No. I will die a warrior's death.

935
01:24:18,505 --> 01:24:20,507
Stories will be told of this day.

936
01:24:20,757 --> 01:24:23,635
Live, and tell those stories yourself.

937
01:24:26,263 --> 01:24:27,681
Now go.

938
01:24:35,314 --> 01:24:38,275
You must return to Asgard.
You have to stop Loki.

939
01:24:38,525 --> 01:24:39,943
What about you?

940
01:24:40,027 --> 01:24:42,321
Do not worry, my friends. I have a plan.

941
01:24:43,238 --> 01:24:44,281
Come on.

942
01:24:48,494 --> 01:24:50,787
We need to fall back. Come on.

943
01:24:50,871 --> 01:24:51,871
Come on.

944
01:24:59,671 --> 01:25:00,964
Wait!

945
01:25:08,764 --> 01:25:09,973
What's he doing?

946
01:25:36,750 --> 01:25:40,254
Brother,
whatever I have done to wrong you,

947
01:25:40,796 --> 01:25:43,590
whatever I have done to lead you
to do this,

948
01:25:44,258 --> 01:25:46,009
I am truly sorry.

949
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:48,971
<i>But these people are innocent.</i>

950
01:25:50,305 --> 01:25:53,433
Taking their lives will gain you nothing.

951
01:26:00,983 --> 01:26:02,442
So take mine

952
01:26:03,485 --> 01:26:04,528
and end this.

953
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:19,793
No.

954
01:26:35,976 --> 01:26:37,185
It's over.

955
01:26:37,561 --> 01:26:39,688
No. It's not over.

956
01:26:40,564 --> 01:26:42,399
I mean, you're safe.

957
01:26:42,482 --> 01:26:44,318
We're safe.

958
01:26:44,985 --> 01:26:46,320
It's over.

959
01:26:52,326 --> 01:26:53,410
No.

960
01:27:11,845 --> 01:27:13,013
No.

961
01:27:38,872 --> 01:27:40,832
<i>- We're spiking.
- Levels increase!</i>

962
01:27:41,083 --> 01:27:42,834
Whosoever holds this hammer,

963
01:27:45,587 --> 01:27:46,587
if he be worthy,

964
01:27:49,758 --> 01:27:51,510
shall possess the power of Thor.

965
01:28:07,484 --> 01:28:08,484
Jane!

966
01:28:11,154 --> 01:28:14,074
- No. No. No!
- Come!

967
01:28:34,761 --> 01:28:38,056
Oh... My... God.

968
01:29:48,084 --> 01:29:49,669
So, is this how you normally look?

969
01:29:50,337 --> 01:29:51,337
More or less.

970
01:29:52,255 --> 01:29:53,715
It's a good look.

971
01:29:54,424 --> 01:29:57,469
We must go to the Bifrost site.
I would have words with my brother.

972
01:29:57,552 --> 01:29:58,678
<i>Excuse me!</i>

973
01:30:02,599 --> 01:30:03,600
Donald?

974
01:30:04,851 --> 01:30:06,510
I don't think
you've been completely honest with me.

975
01:30:06,520 --> 01:30:07,646
Know this, Son of Coul.

976
01:30:08,021 --> 01:30:11,024
You and I, we fight for the same cause,
the protection of this world.

977
01:30:11,107 --> 01:30:13,325
From this day forward,
you can count me as your ally

978
01:30:13,335 --> 01:30:16,112
if you return the items
you have taken from Jane.

979
01:30:16,196 --> 01:30:17,781
- Stolen.
- Borrowed.

980
01:30:18,865 --> 01:30:20,951
Of course, you can have
your equipment back.

981
01:30:21,034 --> 01:30:23,034
<i>You're gonna need it
to continue your research.</i>

982
01:30:23,870 --> 01:30:26,206
Would you like to see
the bridge we spoke of?

983
01:30:26,498 --> 01:30:28,124
Uh, sure.

984
01:30:30,502 --> 01:30:32,295
Wait, I need to debrief you!

985
01:30:39,302 --> 01:30:40,679
Welcome to Asgard.

986
01:31:06,371 --> 01:31:08,540
Heimdall, open the Bifrost.

987
01:31:16,256 --> 01:31:17,632
Heimdall?

988
01:31:21,761 --> 01:31:23,096
<i>Heimdall!</i>

989
01:31:25,223 --> 01:31:26,600
He doesn't answer.

990
01:31:27,267 --> 01:31:28,685
Then we are stranded.

991
01:31:28,768 --> 01:31:31,855
Heimdall!
If you can hear me, we need you now!

992
01:31:33,273 --> 01:31:35,358
<i>Heimdall! We need you now!</i>

993
01:31:41,948 --> 01:31:43,074
Heimdall!

994
01:31:57,797 --> 01:32:00,759
I must go back to Asgard,
but I give you my word,

995
01:32:02,135 --> 01:32:04,471
I will return for you.

996
01:32:12,103 --> 01:32:13,188
Deal?

997
01:32:26,826 --> 01:32:27,994
Deal.

998
01:32:44,552 --> 01:32:46,471
Get him to the healing room!

999
01:32:48,139 --> 01:32:49,516
Leave my brother to me.

1000
01:33:14,541 --> 01:33:16,042
<i>It's said...</i>

1001
01:33:16,376 --> 01:33:21,047
<i>You can still hear and see
what transpires around you.</i>

1002
01:33:22,382 --> 01:33:24,551
I hope it's true,

1003
01:33:26,386 --> 01:33:28,346
so that you may know

1004
01:33:29,347 --> 01:33:33,226
your death came at the hand

1005
01:33:34,394 --> 01:33:35,603
of Laufey.

1006
01:33:44,863 --> 01:33:47,407
And your death came by the son of Odin.

1007
01:33:53,329 --> 01:33:54,329
Loki!

1008
01:33:54,664 --> 01:33:56,249
You saved him!

1009
01:34:00,503 --> 01:34:02,630
I swear to you, Mother,

1010
01:34:02,714 --> 01:34:05,258
that they will pay for what
they've done today.

1011
01:34:05,675 --> 01:34:06,675
Loki.

1012
01:34:07,510 --> 01:34:08,762
Thor!

1013
01:34:09,679 --> 01:34:11,723
I knew you'd return to us.

1014
01:34:17,270 --> 01:34:18,646
Why don't you tell her

1015
01:34:18,730 --> 01:34:22,400
how you sent the Destroyer
to kill our friends, to kill me?

1016
01:34:22,484 --> 01:34:23,484
What?

1017
01:34:23,526 --> 01:34:25,945
Why, it must have been enforcing
Father's last command.

1018
01:34:26,029 --> 01:34:28,865
You're a talented liar, Brother.
Always have been.

1019
01:34:29,616 --> 01:34:30,790
It's good to have you back.

1020
01:34:31,284 --> 01:34:34,370
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have to destroy Jotunheim.

1021
01:35:16,287 --> 01:35:17,747
<i>You can't stop it.</i>

1022
01:35:17,831 --> 01:35:21,126
The Bifrost will build
until it rips Jotunheim apart.

1023
01:35:43,106 --> 01:35:44,274
Jane?

1024
01:35:46,192 --> 01:35:47,610
Why have you done this?

1025
01:35:47,986 --> 01:35:51,030
To prove to Father
that I am the worthy son.

1026
01:35:51,823 --> 01:35:54,284
When he wakes, I will have saved his life.

1027
01:35:54,701 --> 01:35:57,453
I will have destroyed that
race of monsters.

1028
01:35:57,537 --> 01:35:59,581
And I will be true heir to the throne!

1029
01:36:00,039 --> 01:36:01,958
You can't kill an entire race!

1030
01:36:02,041 --> 01:36:03,459
Why not?

1031
01:36:06,212 --> 01:36:09,382
And what is this newfound love
for the Frost Giants?

1032
01:36:10,508 --> 01:36:13,803
You could have killed them all
with your bare hands.

1033
01:36:13,887 --> 01:36:16,055
- I've changed.
- So have I.

1034
01:36:17,849 --> 01:36:19,350
Now fight me.

1035
01:36:22,228 --> 01:36:24,063
I never wanted the throne!

1036
01:36:25,356 --> 01:36:27,275
I only ever wanted to be your equal.

1037
01:36:28,318 --> 01:36:30,028
I will not fight you, Brother!

1038
01:36:30,111 --> 01:36:31,487
I'm not your brother.

1039
01:36:32,405 --> 01:36:33,656
I never was.

1040
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:35,283
Loki, this is madness.

1041
01:36:35,909 --> 01:36:37,535
Is it madness?

1042
01:36:38,369 --> 01:36:39,537
Is it?

1043
01:36:40,914 --> 01:36:41,914
Is it?

1044
01:36:43,124 --> 01:36:46,878
Come on. What happened to you
on Earth that turned you so soft?

1045
01:36:47,921 --> 01:36:49,589
Don't tell me it was that woman.

1046
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:51,925
Oh!

1047
01:36:52,759 --> 01:36:54,010
It was!

1048
01:36:54,093 --> 01:36:58,097
Well, maybe, when we're finished here,
I'll pay her a visit myself!

1049
01:37:40,431 --> 01:37:41,432
Thor!

1050
01:37:49,357 --> 01:37:50,566
Brother, please.

1051
01:38:01,661 --> 01:38:02,912
Enough!

1052
01:38:47,248 --> 01:38:48,291
Look at you,

1053
01:38:50,877 --> 01:38:52,170
the Mighty Thor,

1054
01:38:55,256 --> 01:38:57,008
with all your strength,

1055
01:38:58,301 --> 01:39:00,762
and what good does it do you now, huh?

1056
01:39:02,305 --> 01:39:05,892
Do you hear me, Brother?
There's nothing you can do!

1057
01:39:24,077 --> 01:39:25,078
What are you doing?

1058
01:39:27,080 --> 01:39:30,416
If you destroy the bridge,
you'll never see her again!

1059
01:39:39,926 --> 01:39:41,302
Forgive me, Jane.

1060
01:40:20,258 --> 01:40:22,093
I could have done it, Father!

1061
01:40:23,261 --> 01:40:25,138
<i>I could have done it!</i>

1062
01:40:25,388 --> 01:40:26,806
For you!

1063
01:40:27,557 --> 01:40:29,058
For all of us!

1064
01:40:31,227 --> 01:40:32,562
No, Loki.

1065
01:40:41,112 --> 01:40:42,196
Loki, no.

1066
01:40:43,322 --> 01:40:45,283
No!

1067
01:40:49,996 --> 01:40:51,164
No.

1068
01:41:07,346 --> 01:41:08,639
It's gone.

1069
01:42:21,254 --> 01:42:24,048
And then, with a mighty bellow,

1070
01:42:24,423 --> 01:42:28,511
I flew into the giant metal creature
and laid him low!

1071
01:42:28,594 --> 01:42:32,139
<i>Is that another way of saying
you fell on your huge ass?</i>

1072
01:42:32,223 --> 01:42:33,962
<i>As a matter of fact,</i>

1073
01:42:33,973 --> 01:42:38,406
<i>falling was a tactic
lulling the Destroyer...</i>

1074
01:42:52,577 --> 01:42:55,413
My Queen, I'm so sorry for your loss.

1075
01:43:01,252 --> 01:43:02,587
<i>How is he?</i>

1076
01:43:04,922 --> 01:43:06,924
<i>He mourns for his brother.</i>

1077
01:43:08,259 --> 01:43:09,427
<i>And...</i>

1078
01:43:10,595 --> 01:43:12,138
<i>He misses her.</i>

1079
01:43:13,139 --> 01:43:14,473
<i>The mortal.</i>

1080
01:43:30,948 --> 01:43:32,658
You'll be a wise king.

1081
01:43:37,121 --> 01:43:39,498
There will never be a wiser king than you.

1082
01:43:40,958 --> 01:43:42,627
Or a better father.

1083
01:43:53,512 --> 01:43:56,682
I have... much to learn.

1084
01:43:58,684 --> 01:44:00,186
I know that now.

1085
01:44:05,191 --> 01:44:06,984
Someday, perhaps,

1086
01:44:08,444 --> 01:44:10,363
I shall make you proud.

1087
01:44:17,995 --> 01:44:20,039
You've already made me proud.

1088
01:44:34,720 --> 01:44:36,722
So Earth is lost to us.

1089
01:44:37,848 --> 01:44:38,848
No.

1090
01:44:40,059 --> 01:44:41,852
There is always hope.

1091
01:44:46,065 --> 01:44:47,566
Can you see her?

1092
01:44:50,319 --> 01:44:51,404
<i>Yes.</i>

1093
01:44:55,533 --> 01:44:57,243
I have the particle detectors!

1094
01:44:57,326 --> 01:44:59,620
Darcy, do you have the S.H.I.E.L.D.
satellite codes?

1095
01:44:59,704 --> 01:45:01,789
Yeah. Have you seen my Taser?

1096
01:45:01,872 --> 01:45:03,290
<i>How is she?</i>

1097
01:45:03,374 --> 01:45:05,418
In the car. Come on, Jane!

1098
01:45:05,751 --> 01:45:07,878
<i>She searches for you.</i>

1099
01:53:17,409 --> 01:53:19,369
<i>Dr. Selvig.</i>

1100
01:53:22,206 --> 01:53:24,374
<i>So you're the man behind all this?</i>

1101
01:53:26,543 --> 01:53:28,587
It's quite a labyrinth.

1102
01:53:29,254 --> 01:53:32,674
I was thinking
they're taking me down here to kill me.

1103
01:53:40,390 --> 01:53:43,185
I've been hearing
about the New Mexico situation.

1104
01:53:44,144 --> 01:53:47,773
Your work has impressed a lot of people
who are much smarter than I am.

1105
01:53:47,856 --> 01:53:49,942
I have a lot to work with.

1106
01:53:50,567 --> 01:53:53,862
The Foster Theory.
A gateway to another dimension.

1107
01:53:54,529 --> 01:53:55,697
It's unprecedented.

1108
01:53:58,242 --> 01:53:59,242
Isn't it?

1109
01:54:02,913 --> 01:54:06,250
Legend tells us one thing, history,
another.

1110
01:54:06,583 --> 01:54:10,671
But every now and then,
we find something that belongs to both.

1111
01:54:18,595 --> 01:54:19,471
What is it?

1112
01:54:19,554 --> 01:54:20,597
Power, Doctor.

1113
01:54:21,306 --> 01:54:23,183
<i>If we can figure out how to tap it,</i>

1114
01:54:23,767 --> 01:54:25,102
maybe unlimited power.

1115
01:54:30,983 --> 01:54:33,151
Well, I guess that's worth a look.

1116
01:54:34,987 --> 01:54:37,281
Well, I guess that's worth a look.
