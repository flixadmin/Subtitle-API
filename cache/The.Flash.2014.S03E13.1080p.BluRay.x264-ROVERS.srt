1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,201
BARRY: <i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,767
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,400
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,642
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

5
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,525
<i>In an attempt to stop
the evil speedster, Savitar,</i>

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,682
<i>I was accidentally thrust into the future,</i>

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,286
<i>and I saw him
murder the woman that I love.</i>

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,680
<i>But I won't let that happen.</i>

9
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,969
<i>I'm gonna do everything
in my power to change the future.</i>

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,441
<i>And I'm the only one
fast enough to keep her alive.</i>

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,841
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

12
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,449
CISCO: <i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

13
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,601
It's definitely a meta.

14
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,450
<i>I think this is someone new.</i>

15
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,763
I'm Cisco, by the way. You must be Gypsy.

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,445
- So, it's goodbye, then?
- For now.

17
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,006
Caitlin, you do not wanna do this.

18
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,481
Time for me to own who I really am.

19
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,005
You're one of the strongest people
I've ever known.

20
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,207
You can win this fight.

21
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,405
- Jesse!
- No, no, no.

22
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,607
What's wrong?

23
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,889
Grodd, he's got my dad.
He has him in Gorilla City.

24
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,004
It's been two weeks since he disappeared.

25
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,889
I mean, no one's seen
or heard from him since.

26
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,771
Slow down.
Just start from the beginning, okay?

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,843
Why did your dad go to Gorilla City?

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,001
JOE: <i>Wait. Can we slow down even further?</i>

29
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,207
What the hell is a Gorilla City?

30
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,407
Okay,

31
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,881
so there are sentient,

32
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,202
highly intelligent evolved gorillas
in Earth-2.

33
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,011
And they all live in a city
deep in the heart of Africa.

34
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,208
We sent Grodd there
when he went after Fay Wray here.

35
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,725
- Grodd's there?
- Mmm.

36
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,207
Why on Earth, any Earth,
would your father wanna go there?

37
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,886
I mean, we received a mathematical
cryptogram at our S.T.A.R. Labs.

38
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,725
It was highly complex.
It took a week to decode it,

39
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,120
but my dad and I did.

40
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,281
What did it say?

41
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,363
It was an invitation

42
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,565
from the gorillas to my dad.

43
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,766
- Why Harry?
- They wanted to meet him.

44
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,285
So he mounted an expedition
with 10 other people,

45
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,084
and they went into the jungle.

46
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,562
But they failed multiple check-ins,
and a search party went in after them.

47
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,209
But all they found
were the bodies,

48
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,724
all of them beaten to death.

49
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,528
But no one's seen my dad.

50
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,481
I mean, is he...

51
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,449
No. No, he's alive.

52
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,844
They went to a lot of trouble to get him
there. They need him for something.

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,128
We're gonna figure out what that is.

54
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,171
Oh... There you guys are!
I've been looking all over for you.

55
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,765
Are we going for coffee or what?

56
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:42,921
Dad!

57
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,247
Oh!

58
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,122
Yes.
That's how you say good morning, people!

59
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,645
With hugs. Hi.

60
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,521
Jesse, that's not who you think it is.
This is H.R.

61
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,921
You met him briefly
before you left last time.

62
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,161
At your service, Madame.

63
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,964
He's Harry's replacement.

64
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,929
Some would say "improvement."

65
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,003
- Um, this is Harry's daughter.
- Yeah.

66
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,440
He's been kidnapped.

67
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,046
Eep! I didn't know. I'm so... I thought...

68
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,440
Sorry about that.

69
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,046
I'm sorry, too.
I'm sorry I took the smile from your face.

70
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,927
What are you thinking about?

71
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,441
The future.

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,206
This headline from the future,

73
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,089
"City Still Recovering
From Gorilla Attack."

74
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,961
So you're thinking this headline
and Harry being taken are tied together?

75
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,487
I mean, it can't be a coincidence, right?

76
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,803
Harry getting lured to Gorilla City.
Grodd must be planning something.

77
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,883
Seems like he's planning
to come back to this Earth.

78
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,644
And not alone, by the sound of it.

79
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,963
If we rescue Harry, then maybe that stops
whatever Grodd's planning here,

80
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,485
and maybe that changes the future.

81
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,688
- Which would change my future.
- JOE: Mmm.

82
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,443
So we save Harry, we save Iris.
But you're not sure.

83
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,490
No, but I'm going either way.

84
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,007
Harry's my friend.
I'm not gonna just abandon him.

85
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,003
I'm going back to Earth-2.

86
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,561
And I suppose you'll want
somebody to come with you

87
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,330
who's gonna open those breaches for you?

88
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,960
We had so much fun last time.

89
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,691
Fun-ish. I'm in.

90
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,200
I'm gonna come, too.
I have a special connection with Grodd.

91
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,885
Maybe we can use that
to get through to him.

92
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,041
Yes, okay.

93
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,247
Great, yeah, I'm coming, too.

94
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,204
No, I'm sorry, Jesse. No.

95
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,368
Look, I didn't come here
for you to take all the risk.

96
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,521
I'm going to help.

97
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,160
Your dad would kill me
if I let you come along.

98
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,328
I'm a speedster now, okay?
I can take care of myself.

99
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,767
I know, which is exactly why
I need you to stay here.

100
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,526
I mean, this city needs protecting
while we're gone.

101
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,444
Besides, maybe you can teach Wally
a thing or two.

102
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,281
- Wait. What is he talking about?
- Um...

103
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,680
Wow.

104
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,803
So, you're a speedster now.

105
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,086
Yeah, we're both speedsters now.

106
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,882
Great. Yeah, that's, uh...

107
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,483
That's awesome.

108
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,931
I, um, thought she'd be
more excited than that.

109
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,324
Hey, Julian, would you maybe
be able to cover for me at work

110
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,891
for the next few days?

111
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,690
"Few days"? Why?

112
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,320
I just have a thing where...

113
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,881
- It's just... It's Flash stuff.
- Such as?

114
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,404
A friend of ours is lost
on a parallel Earth,

115
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,369
and we're gonna go get him back.

116
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,409
- "A parallel Earth"?
- Yeah, a...

117
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,245
This is the... This is the multi-verse.

118
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,924
Fascinating!
And do you often travel to other Earths?

119
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,809
No, I... Well, when I have to.

120
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,884
Look, Julian,
will you just tell Singh that,

121
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,724
I don't know,
I'm under the weather or something?

122
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,770
You know, it is kind of what we do
on Team Flash. We cover for each other.

123
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,685
What does Caitlin think of all this
multi-verse hopping? Does she approve?

124
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,887
She's coming with me.

125
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,769
- You're letting her go?
- It's her choice.

126
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,729
Allen, it's not a wise move, surely.

127
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,281
She can barely control her cold powers
as is, I mean...

128
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,930
We might need her for Grodd.

129
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,285
Grodd?

130
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,922
- Telepathic gorilla?
- Yeah.

131
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,248
Where are you going?
Are you going to <i>Planet of the Apes?</i>

132
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,767
No, it's just a city of them.
Okay, will you cover for me?

133
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,371
Are you going to <i>Planet of the Apes?</i>

134
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,285
I'm not going to <i>Planet of the Apes,</i> okay?
Calm down. Will you cover for me?

135
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,601
I got you. Yeah, of course.

136
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,961
Okay, thank you. See you in a few days.

137
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,610
All right, man.

138
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,810
BARRY: <i>And make sure Wally doesn't...</i>
IRIS WEST: <i>I won't.</i>

139
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,530
Because, you know,
sometimes he can be a little...

140
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,205
- Barry.
- You know, if given the opportunity...

141
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,284
Barry, I am very good at bossing
my little brother around, okay?

142
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,561
- Don't worry.
- All right.

143
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,165
Just, please don't do anything stupid.

144
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,761
You mean like voluntarily going
to a city of super-apes?

145
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,126
I'm being serious.

146
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,530
Rescue Harry, but other than that,
you don't have to do this for me.

147
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,967
Everything I do is for you.

148
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,681
Good.

149
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,322
- Y'all know Wally can hear you, right?
- Sorry, Wally.

150
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,087
Be safe. Hey, you see
anything hinkey, you run.

151
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,605
Listen to me.
I don't need to tell you that.

152
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,529
- I promise.
- All right.

153
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,441
Detective.

154
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,651
Indiana Jones, much?

155
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,246
Cisco, my friend,
this is not my first expedition,

156
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,522
and, believe me,
this is the perfect attire.

157
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,044
Wait. Julian, what's going on?
I thought you were gonna cover for me.

158
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,281
I spoke to Captain Singh.

159
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,761
He thinks we're at a morphology conference
up in Bludhaven.

160
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,526
So, if it's all the same to you...

161
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,201
All right.

162
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,647
You don't have to come, Julian.
You don't even know Harry.

163
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,849
Come on.
Chance to travel to another dimension?

164
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,201
I mean, I wasn't gonna miss that.

165
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,010
We're not going sightseeing.

166
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,681
Neither am I.

167
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,921
Well, damn.

168
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,971
All right, Jesse, Wally, make sure
the city's safe while I'm gone, all right?

169
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,121
We will.

170
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,683
Hey, Barry, if you see my dad,
just tell him...

171
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,888
You'll see him real soon, Jesse.
Speedster's honor.

172
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,771
All right, let's do this.

173
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,524
Okay.

174
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,409
Earth-2, here we come.

175
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,081
How was that?

176
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,765
Bloody brilliant.

177
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,401
Wow.

178
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,407
Well, we made it.

179
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,604
Welcome to the jungle, baby.

180
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,769
CISCO: <i>Earth-2 Africa.</i>

181
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,921
<i>Not hot.</i>

182
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,889
<i>Guess global warming's
not really a thing here.</i>

183
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,526
But bugs are!

184
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,841
JULIAN: Someone please help me out.

185
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,726
How exactly does saving someone
on this Earth prevent an attack on ours?

186
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,009
If Grodd is planning to attack, he's gonna
need to open a breach to our Earth,

187
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,083
and the only one over here
that can open one is...

188
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,241
CAITLIN: Harrison Wells.

189
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,526
Harrison Wells, yeah.

190
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,604
So, if we save him from Grodd,
then he can't get to our Earth,

191
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,804
the attack never happens,
we change the future,

192
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,440
and we're one step closer to saving Iris.

193
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,481
Hey.

194
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,085
You wanna go for a run?

195
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,121
Uh, yeah, yeah. Maybe later.

196
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,201
Are you okay?

197
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,290
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

198
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,369
Look, I know I haven't been great
at keeping in touch.

199
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,682
It's just everything's been so crazy,

200
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,161
trying to train with Barry
and shadowing him,

201
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,687
and I just haven't had that much time
for other things.

202
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,966
Yeah, or other people.

203
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,246
That is not what I meant.

204
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,722
No, look, I get it. Trust me.

205
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,649
It's not easy being a hero, is it?

206
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,491
No, but I love every minute of it.

207
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,247
Right.

208
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,840
Are you sure you're okay, because...

209
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,606
Yeah, I'm just worried about my dad.

210
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,281
- Hey.
- Hey.

211
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,364
I hope we didn't interrupt you two.

212
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,887
Nope. Nothing to interrupt.

213
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,202
Aren't you... You aren't happy she's back?

214
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,169
I am. I just wish she felt the same.

215
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,244
Ever since she got here,
she's been acting so weird with me.

216
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,370
I don't know if it's because
I have powers or if it's just me...

217
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,288
Wally, she's probably still just upset
because her father's missing, right?

218
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,930
Yeah, it's hard to focus on other things

219
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,889
when something like that
is weighing you down.

220
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,201
IRIS WEST: <i>Yeah, Wally, She'll be fine.</i>

221
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,604
Just give her some time,
and then, you know, lock it down!

222
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,046
- Ooh, "Lock it down"?
- Yeah.

223
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,090
What, you think I didn't notice that your
Facebook profile still says, "Single"?

224
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,971
What? Well, I mean,
technically, I'm still single.

225
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,166
What was it?

226
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,249
Robbery in progress
at O'Sullivan Bank.

227
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,401
You two go.

228
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,369
Come on, let's go.

229
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,245
Didn't hear the news, huh?

230
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,401
ROBBER 1: What news?

231
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,562
That you don't mess
with Kid Flash.

232
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,768
We've got to get back to our friends.
They're expecting us.

233
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,570
Yeah, they picked some real winners.

234
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,011
I know, which is more than I can say
for you two.

235
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,367
Be right back.

236
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,400
Sorry, I had to stretch my legs.

237
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,285
Oh, it's...
There's nothing to see here, guys.

238
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,602
It's just a couple of fools
getting their asses handed to them.

239
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,970
Thank you. Oh, my gosh, thank you! It's...

240
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,609
Want some water?

241
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,961
I'm okay, thanks.

242
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,124
It's important to stay hydrated
on a parallel Earth.

243
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,963
So weird being back here
on this alternate universe.

244
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,363
This is where I met my doppelganger,
the evil one, Killer Frost.

245
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,800
JULIAN: Huh.

246
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,928
CAITLIN: She's the one
I'm always afraid of becoming.

247
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,251
And where is she now?

248
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,961
Dead.

249
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,605
Well, that's not gonna
happen to you, Caitlin.

250
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,566
I'm glad you came with us, Julian.
You're a nice addition to the team.

251
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,806
Yeah, well, I live for danger.

252
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:12,726
CISCO: We're close, guys.

253
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,641
Do you hear that?

254
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,971
This is it.

255
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,566
It's a trap.

256
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:01,642
GRODD: <i>Welcome, Caitlin.
Knew you'd come, Flash.</i>

257
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,287
You guys all right?

258
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,081
Yeah, I'm okay.

259
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,526
Yeah, me, too.

260
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,762
I've lost my gun, but I'm all right.

261
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,922
Well, looks like you're gonna have
to phase us out of here.

262
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,887
I can't.

263
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,490
I don't know. Something's holding me back.
Can you open a breach?

264
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,007
No dice.

265
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,931
Yeah. I don't think it's the cell. I...

266
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,768
Grodd must be dampening
our powers somehow.

267
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,641
Okay.

268
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,521
CAITLIN: <i>Harry?</i>

269
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,886
You're all right!

270
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,849
BARRY: <i>Wells!</i>

271
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,049
Hey! You've got to help us get out of here
before the gorillas come back.

272
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,406
Hello, Flash.

273
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,481
Grodd.

274
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,483
JULIAN: <i>Wait. What?
That's Grodd, the gorilla?</i>

275
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,608
He's talking through Wells?
That's a thing?

276
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,330
Yeah, yeah,
sort of trips you out at first,

277
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,641
but, trust me, you get used to it.

278
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,962
Grodd, let him go.

279
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,330
This is between you and me.

280
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,491
Not yet.

281
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,524
- I need him.
- For what?

282
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,170
Why'd you lure him here?

283
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,526
<i>For you.</i>

284
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,847
Need your help.

285
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,930
"Help"?
You got a funny way of asking for it.

286
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,811
You sent me here, remember?

287
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,088
To live in this hell,

288
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,802
where I am forced to serve
under the rule of Solovar.

289
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,530
Who's Solovar?

290
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,048
Leader of gorillakind,
ruler of Gorilla City.

291
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,524
And now he wants to rule the humans.

292
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,251
He will bring war to your Earth.

293
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,447
Why?

294
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,889
He has seen many conflicts
between gorillas and humans.

295
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,447
He is afraid the humans will attack,

296
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,400
but now that you're here,
he will bring the fight to you.

297
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,211
So you lured us here to stop him?

298
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,886
As trespassers,

299
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,726
you will be sent to the arena
and executed.

300
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,531
What? How about a signpost at the front?
"All trespassers will be executed."

301
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,563
That wouldn't be the worst idea, would it?

302
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:04,409
It will be Solovar's great honor
to kill you himself.

303
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,206
- Hmm.
- But, Flash,

304
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,051
if he were to be defeated,

305
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:16,121
the other gorillas would see his weakness
and would no longer follow him.

306
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,762
Well, I'm not gonna kill anyone,
not even a gorilla.

307
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,160
<i>Kill or be killed!</i>

308
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,005
This is the only law
gorillakind understands.

309
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,242
How do you benefit from this, Grodd?

310
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:32,043
Solovar falls, I take his place.
I rule the gorillas.

311
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,091
And I promise to keep them
in Gorilla City.

312
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,525
How do we know we can trust you?

313
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:45,766
Because even though you sent me away,

314
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,605
<i>your Earth is still my home.</i>

315
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:54,648
And there are those among you
I will never forget.

316
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:06,683
<i>Kill Solovar
and Central City will be spared.</i>

317
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:13,608
<i>Fail, and see your home turned to ash.</i>

318
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,805
WALLY: <i>Jesse, you got a sec?</i>

319
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,605
Did I do something wrong?

320
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,131
I don't think so.

321
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,249
Okay, then why are you being
so cold with me?

322
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,480
Jesse, come on, you can talk to me.

323
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,484
I know that this is
about more than just your dad.

324
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,929
Look, I guess...

325
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,485
I guess I thought one day
we'd figure out a way to be together.

326
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,211
You know, but now that
you have your powers,

327
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,885
it's like I never hear from you.

328
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,170
Jesse, if you would, I want you to stay.

329
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,448
- I can't.
- Why?

330
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,246
Because of your dad?
Because Barry is going to find him.

331
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,006
Look, you don't know that, okay?
You don't.

332
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,568
When I first got my power,

333
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,644
you were so lost
not having yours, you know,

334
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,486
and I thought maybe part of the reason
why you liked me was

335
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,449
'cause you were attracted
to speed and not me.

336
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,600
I know. I know, okay?

337
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,210
But I saw you out there today,
being Kid Flash, okay,

338
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,682
and you were complete, Wally.
You were scary complete.

339
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,363
I can have all the speed in the world,
I'm not "complete" without you.

340
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,681
Stay.

341
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,250
Barry, do you really think
you could kill this Solovar?

342
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,163
Do you think you could take a life?

343
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,125
SOLOVAR: <i>It is as I feared.
The humans court war with gorillakind.</i>

344
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,603
<i>Why did you not tell me, Grodd,
more humans had entered the city?</i>

345
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,922
GRODD: <i>I was about to inform you, Solovar.</i>

346
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,691
SOLOVAR: <i>Why?</i>

347
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,761
<i>Why are you here?</i>

348
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,160
<i>To study us like animals?</i>

349
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,607
<i>Make us your pets?</i>

350
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,084
No, no! I...

351
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,560
We came here in peace.

352
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,564
We entered your city by mistake.
We mean you no harm.

353
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,210
Please, just let me and my friends go,

354
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,010
and I promise,
we'll never come back here again.

355
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,008
My brethren have seen you.

356
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,851
Your fate is sealed.

357
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,967
You will all die by my hand in the arena

358
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:30,042
so that all will know that
Solovar's justice is wise and swift.

359
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,727
All right, I'll make you a deal.

360
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,011
I'll fight you in the arena.

361
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,366
<i>Just me.</i>

362
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:47,163
But if I beat you, you let my friends go
and you leave us alone for good.

363
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,686
I accept.

364
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,681
<i>Humans and their arrogance.</i>

365
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,360
First you will suffer,
then I will grant you each

366
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,091
a horrible death.

367
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,405
Speedster versus Super Gorilla.

368
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,244
Best worst video game ever.

369
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,404
Do you really think that
Barry can beat Solovar?

370
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,609
- Well, he'd better for all of our sakes.
- It's starting.

371
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,925
SOLOVAR: <i>After you die,</i>

372
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,970
<i>your friends will follow you
into the black.</i>

373
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,167
We'll see.

374
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,769
Okay, Barry, I've got a plan for you.
It's all about the speed punches.

375
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,400
Speed punches. Come on, Barry.

376
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,567
Change of plans, Barry.
It's all about the running away.

377
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,565
What about a lightning throw?

378
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,802
Yes! Barry, lightning throw!

379
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,689
Worth a shot!

380
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,360
That's 0 for 2.

381
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,885
Come on, Barry, get up!

382
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,684
Oh, my days,
this is quite the reversal of our fortune.

383
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,086
"Reversal."

384
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,121
Barry, it's time to pull a Reverse-Flash.

385
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,281
Do it!

386
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,090
He did it.

387
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,250
He actually did it! He bloody well did it.

388
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,325
I won't kill him.

389
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:49,921
I won't!

390
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,686
I know you all fear humans.

391
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,330
You think we want war with gorillakind.

392
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,771
We don't.

393
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,844
We're not all murderers and killers.

394
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,642
We only want peace,

395
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,570
which is why I'm sparing your leader.

396
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,011
We call it mercy.

397
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,720
GRODD: <i>Take him out!</i>

398
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,721
What happened?

399
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,522
Congratulations, you won.

400
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,007
What about Harry?

401
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,051
He's still catatonic.

402
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,801
Flash.

403
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,600
I won.

404
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,489
Solovar promised to let us go.

405
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,641
No.

406
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,240
No? What do you...

407
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,561
I don't understand.

408
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,127
Solovar's words mean nothing now.

409
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,806
You never had any intentions
of letting us go, did you?

410
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,486
I told you I needed you.

411
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,044
<i>I could not defeat Solovar in combat,
but you could.</i>

412
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,569
You did,
and now I am the ruler of Gorilla City,

413
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,484
and all the gorillas will follow me.

414
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,290
Solovar never wanted
to attack Central City.

415
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,521
You do.

416
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:45,208
You took my home away from me,
and now I will take it back!

417
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,445
The gorillas saw what you did, Flash.
They saw you defeat Solovar,

418
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,162
<i>and now they are afraid of humans
and will do anything I order,</i>

419
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,086
and I will order them to invade
your Earth, and your city will burn!

420
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,730
You were planning this the whole time.

421
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,484
Yes.

422
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,284
Father taught me well.

423
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,410
Always think ahead.

424
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:14,527
And I had plenty of time to think in cages
built by you and then by Solovar.

425
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,681
Then why don't you just kill us, huh?

426
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,842
Since we already did
your damn dirty work for you?

427
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,081
Still need you.

428
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,328
I'm not doing anything for you.

429
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,370
Not you, Flash. You.

430
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,207
Me?

431
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:37,648
You will open a breach to First Earth.
My army will cross that breach,

432
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,607
and all the humans in Central City
will burn before gorillakind.

433
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:47,925
Grodd, you are smart,
maybe smarter than all of us.

434
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,042
Smart enough to know
that you cannot do this.

435
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,363
Intelligence and violence,
they're opposites from each other.

436
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:59,481
What you wanna do, it's not logical,
not for someone as wise as you are.

437
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,290
You forget, Flash, I am an animal.

438
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,283
I am a gorilla.

439
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,602
Kill or be killed!

440
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,762
I'm gonna get out of this cell,
and I'm gonna stop you.

441
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,410
<i>No, you won't.</i>

442
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,881
<i>You will die.</i>

443
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,321
Snow?

444
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,481
You okay?

445
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,089
I have a headache, I guess.

446
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,446
Oh!

447
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,081
And I think... Is that me I smell?

448
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,651
That counts as okay.

449
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:58,081
- Jesse, my daughter, where is...
- She's fine. She's on Earth-1.

450
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,366
She's totally fine.

451
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,168
<i>Barry, Cisco...</i>

452
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,080
You guys all came for me?

453
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:15,529
A city of evil genius apes,
sounded like fun.

454
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:20,322
Well, I don't deserve it,
but thank you, Snow. Thank you, Barry.

455
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,361
<i>Cisco.</i>

456
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,566
Indiana.

457
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,969
It's Julian Albert, thank you,
and I came along for...

458
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,201
I live for danger.

459
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,442
Looks like you came to the right place.

460
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,602
I still can't phase through the bars.

461
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,001
We have to find a way out of here
so we can stop him.

462
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,208
You keep saying that,
but what if we can't get out?

463
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,044
What if we're stuck here?

464
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,248
- What if this is the way...
- Well, we can't think like that.

465
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,171
Where there's life, there's hope.

466
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,725
And if there isn't life?

467
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,325
What is that supposed to mean?

468
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:01,370
Grodd needs me to open a breach
so he can attack Earth-1.

469
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,851
What if I wasn't alive to do that?

470
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,800
You planning on dying?

471
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,325
Only if you kill me.

472
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,889
CISCO: <i>Look, this is something
we have to consider.</i>

473
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,202
Right now, I can't think
of any other way to stop them.

474
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,408
They'd have no other way
of getting to Central City.

475
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,891
JULIAN: <i>He's right.</i>

476
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:20,243
Cisco's death would change
the newspaper headline in the future.

477
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,130
- "Headline"?
- It's a long story.

478
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,248
But it would also make
another one come true,

479
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,328
the one about Killer Frost.

480
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,410
You want me to kill you?

481
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,965
Think about it.

482
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,726
Grodd doesn't know you have cold powers.
You might be able to use them.

483
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:40,568
"Cold powers"? She...
You have cold powers. I knew it.

484
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,326
I knew that you and I
did not get Barry out of that mirror.

485
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,289
JULIAN: <i>Wait. Caitlin,</i>

486
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,284
if you kill someone,
there's no going back.

487
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,644
<i>You'll be Killer Frost
for the rest of your life.</i>

488
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,167
Now, I did not come all this way
to see that happen.

489
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,563
Did you come here because
you "live for danger" or to protect me?

490
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,607
I just don't wanna see you become
something you're not.

491
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,531
Okay, Cisco, I'm not gonna kill you,
and neither is anyone else, okay?

492
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,165
So let's come up with the next best plan

493
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,004
that doesn't involve
murdering one of our friends.

494
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,286
BARRY: <i>No, Cisco's right.</i>

495
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,488
It's the only way.

496
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,762
One of us has to die.

497
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,641
Ho!

498
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,327
Hi.

499
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,485
What are you doing up there?

500
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,330
Just, uh, hanging out.

501
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,211
What are you thinking about?

502
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:48,331
Wally, he wants me to stay here with him.

503
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,366
Yeah, he does!

504
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,487
Guy's no dummy. Congratulations.

505
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,490
That's great. Love!
Nothing like young love.

506
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,809
Yeah, I just...
I don't know if it's the right thing.

507
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,721
Why?

508
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,923
I mean, he's on his own journey.

509
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,163
Besides, my dad just got captured
by gorillas.

510
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,887
And if he does come back,
how could I ever tell him I'm leaving?

511
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:15,328
Well, 'cause you're human.
That's how. That's what we do.

512
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,323
<i>Look, my point is this.</i>

513
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,051
When it comes to love,
you've got to go for it!

514
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,043
<i>You know? Everything else be damned.</i>

515
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,283
'Cause if you don't, you're gonna end up
being the kind of person

516
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,887
that lives the rest of their life
with regret.

517
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,809
I mean, I know that telling your dad that,
you know, you're just switching Earths,

518
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,361
that's gonna be
a difficult conversation to have,

519
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,047
but one that you've got to go for
if you wanna be happy.

520
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,046
But that's, you know, just my opinion.
What do I know?

521
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,761
I'm just a handsomer guy than your dad
with a song in his heart.

522
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,570
Good luck, Jesse.

523
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,404
He started coughing, violently,

524
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,362
and then he clutched his side
and keeled over.

525
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:24,130
The injury, it must have ruptured
one of his kidneys.

526
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,767
He went into shock.

527
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,250
<i>His heart stopped.</i>

528
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,009
I couldn't resuscitate him.

529
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,285
GRODD: <i>Cold.</i>

530
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,531
He's dead.

531
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,446
<i>He was of no use to me anyway.</i>

532
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,970
He's gone, Barry.

533
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,967
Grodd is gone.

534
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,805
Come on, mate!

535
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,726
Yo, it worked!

536
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,928
- Shh!
- It worked.

537
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,003
Allen! Allen, are you all right, mate?

538
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,162
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

539
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,970
I didn't freeze you too much, did I?

540
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,369
No, I'm good.

541
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,526
Well, then,
let's get the hell out of here.

542
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,841
Yeah.

543
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,641
Go!

544
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,050
All right.

545
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,211
Let's go.

546
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,205
All right. We should be far enough out

547
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,566
that you should be able
to use your powers.

548
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,881
We need a breach open right now.

549
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,405
Guys, we've got to go
before they realize we're gone!

550
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,722
It's too late for that.

551
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,686
- Run!
- Run!

552
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,404
Open a breach!

553
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,410
Time to warp out of this madhouse.

554
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,050
All right? Go!

555
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,526
Hey, gang, who wants to take their mind
off their troubles with

556
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,961
a sure-to-take-your-mind-off-your-troubles
game of charades?

557
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,360
I'll go first. Okay.

558
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,403
Let's see, movie. I mean...

559
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,886
One word.

560
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,321
Dad!

561
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,843
Oh.

562
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,600
You okay?

563
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,807
Good, yeah.

564
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,450
I'm sorry you guys missed it.

565
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,841
I ain't. Ah!

566
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,728
Word of advice,
don't volunteer for these things.

567
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:37,287
Nothing ever tries to rip you
limb-from-limb if you don't volunteer.

568
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,171
I'm fine. I'm so fine. Thanks.

569
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,800
Thanks to our friends, our good friends.

570
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,841
You're welcome, Harry.

571
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,446
I... I think...

572
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,961
I just forgot just how handsome you were.

573
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,371
Oh. I forgot. He's... You're still here.

574
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,927
Yeah! Still here.

575
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,801
I guess we have
your tactical and technical genius

576
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,689
to thank for getting us out of that fix.

577
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,403
No, no. Nah.

578
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,561
"Nah"?

579
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,006
Nah.

580
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,521
<i>You were completely right about him.
He's a total fraud.</i>

581
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,250
- <i>He's not even a scientist.</i>
- Yeah.

582
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,607
And I'm sure he couldn't even remember
an ATM code if you tried.

583
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,171
All those numbers.

584
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,322
It's only four digits.
Why is he still here?

585
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,324
Because we couldn't do it without him.

586
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,845
I thank you, Francisco.

587
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,170
"Francisco"?

588
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,321
Don't ask.

589
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:28,324
Yo, so what actually happened? You fight
some really super-smart apes or what?

590
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,925
Yeah. Yeah, we did.

591
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:34,688
And they were smart, but today at least,
we were a bit smarter.

592
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,045
How's he doing?

593
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,043
He's gonna be okay.

594
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,569
He's got some cuts and bruises,

595
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,644
but Caitlin said
he just needs food and a little sleep.

596
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,966
Okay.

597
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:07,880
Hey, I'm sorry for being
an epic basket case lately.

598
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:13,285
My, uh, dad was kidnapped once,
and it turns your world.

599
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,487
You turn my world, Wally.

600
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,045
Look, I need you
to be honest about something.

601
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,850
Of course.

602
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,210
When my dad wakes up,

603
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:31,570
if I tell him that I love him,
and I'll always be his daughter,

604
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:35,247
but that I wanna move to Earth-1,

605
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,766
what would you think about that?

606
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,446
That's what I think.

607
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,762
I'm glad we think alike.

608
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,324
I see that you took my love advice.

609
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,045
You know,
when it comes to scientific advice,

610
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,611
mine is sometimes specious,

611
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,445
but when it comes
to affairs of the heart, well,

612
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,931
I consider myself a genius.

613
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,445
Okay, yeah, we're gonna go now.

614
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,601
- Yeah.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

615
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,569
Okay. Great.

616
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,291
Congratulations, I'm happy for you.

617
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,442
Invite me to the wedding.

618
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,922
He's gonna be so pissed.

619
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,122
Caitlin, wait.

620
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,006
Listen, if I overstepped,
then I apologize.

621
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,366
Just, after drinks the other night...

622
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,921
You were willing to risk your life for me?

623
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,489
I've been doing
a lot of silly things recently.

624
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,483
I thought adding one more to the list
wouldn't do any harm.

625
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,642
I like you, Julian. I do.

626
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,801
And I like that you like me,

627
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,167
but I'm also afraid of my powers,

628
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,885
and not what they could do to me,

629
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,850
but what they could do to anyone
who gets close to me.

630
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,287
- Caitlin, I'm not afraid.
- You should be.

631
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,849
Fear me, Julian.

632
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,042
It's not a threat, just good advice.

633
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:08,847
Okay. Fine. I'll fear you.

634
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:13,650
You know what really helps me
when I'm scared?

635
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,801
What?

636
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,323
Just a good fillet steak.

637
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,323
Little Béarnaise on the side,
mashed potatoes.

638
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,931
- Does the trick every time.
- Really?

639
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,081
I promise.

640
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:29,406
I think we should find a local steak house
and be terrified together.

641
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,644
Sure, together it is.

642
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,126
Well,

643
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,281
We did it.

644
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,566
You did it.

645
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,042
No, we all did it.

646
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,921
We changed the future
without changing who we are.

647
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:58,368
If we can keep doing this,
we can stop Savitar.

648
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,566
Wherever he is, however he's gonna
come at us, I can stop him.

649
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:02,721
I know it now.

650
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,481
How do you do that?

651
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,846
Do what?

652
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,207
Stay positive
in the face of overwhelming odds?

653
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:14,242
Because I plan on living
a long life with you,

654
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,890
and nothing's gonna
take that away from me.

655
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,561
Good.

656
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,724
So does that mean no more nightmares?

657
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,644
You're finally gonna get
some sleep tonight?

658
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:29,042
Well, that last part
is entirely up to you.

659
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,561
Oh?

660
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:45,690
GRODD: <i>Like I told Flash,
always think ahead.</i>

661
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,371
<i>Now you will open the breaches,</i>

662
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:55,880
<i>and very soon,
Central City will fall before Grodd!</i>
