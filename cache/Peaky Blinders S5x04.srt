1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,350
You've both met bad men before.
The man we're about to meet is the devil.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,914
Michael Gray.

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,032
You lost all your cousin"s money
in America playing the fool.

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,109
And poor old Arthur Shelby
is afraid his wife will never return.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,431
There's a bullet,
and on it is carved the name McCavern.

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,998
It's war you want,

7
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,952
it's war you shall have.

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,673
I've been talking to the Friends.

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,473
One of the Friends is a man.

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,069
He would die without his eyes.

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,874
These hands belong to the devil!

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,719
By the time
that baby draws its first breath,

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,069
you and I will be done.

14
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,395
You will be king.

15
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,959
Happy or sad, Tommy?

16
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,269
Mr Shelby.

17
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,554
My bullets ache
to get inside your tinker head.

18
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,151
You know, it's a pity.

19
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,953
I was looking forward to killing you.

20
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:43,240
You're at the back of a long queue.

21
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,916
My white flag is a flag of truce.

22
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,037
Yours is more a flag of surrender.

23
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,480
Whatever you say, Mr McCavern,
the colour is the same.

24
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,749
The outcome is the same.

25
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,111
I believe we've friends in common.

26
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,674
We should postpone our war.

27
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,189
Your brother left me a hand grenade.

28
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,640
He sends his apologies.

29
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,717
You left me land mines.

30
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,639
For which I too apologise.

31
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,671
Then peace it is.

32
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,156
Your message said you wanted
to seal our truce with some business.

33
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,991
Since we're men of similar interests
and distribution networks,

34
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,680
I thought we might use
our temporary settlement

35
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,791
for our mutual benefit.

36
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,878
You stand in a yard full of scrap metal
and stolen goods,

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,434
and you talk like a politician.

38
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,951
No, nothing here is stolen, Mr McCavern.

39
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,469
Charlie simply finds things
before they're lost.

40
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,192
The nature of the deal
is explained in my proposal.

41
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:45,915
I've booked you a suite
at the Midland Hotel.

42
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,158
If you need anything in this city,
just mention my name.

43
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,152
So you want to impress me, Mr Shelby?

44
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,760
Isiah.

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,631
Also in the envelope is a cheque
for £500.

46
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:06,469
For your wife.
She can use it to buy a black dress,

47
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,433
rent a black horse with black feathers

48
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,552
to pull a black carriage
with your body in it,

49
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,559
should you break the terms
of the white flag.

50
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,919
Now, please, enjoy the city
it's my honour to represent.

51
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,592
This week I've managed
to get to the people

52
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,678
at York and Lincoln City.
I mean, they're the teams that are losing.

53
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,790
I got to them.

54
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,237
Right, go on. Go on, take your time.

55
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,350
Mm.

56
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,554
I got to the goalkeepers,
they all said £5 is enough.

57
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,670
I, erm...

58
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,917
I've written to the people
at Tranmere Rovers

59
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,759
because the phone you put
into my...into my house stopped working.

60
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,598
So I'm gonna need
another one of those.

61
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,869
OK.

62
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,198
Once we've got that fixed,
hey, then we'll have all the names

63
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,951
and numbers
of the First Division referees.

64
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,115
The First?

65
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,275
Yeah.

66
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,552
Ah, shit, shit, shit, shit.

67
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,353
Come on, come on. Come on.

68
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,233
Listen, listen to me. Come on now.

69
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,998
No need for that. Hm?

70
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,269
Yeah.

71
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,914
We need you to find out
what they like.

72
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,077
You know, what gets them going.

73
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,556
Cos a lot of them are comfortable.
A fiver's nothing to them.

74
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,910
We need you to find out
what they really like playing.

75
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,235
Yes.

76
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,431
See, cos we can offer them that.

77
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,153
Oh, yeah. Shelby Company Limited,

78
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,319
we can offer them
all the lovely things people like.

79
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,510
Hm?

80
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,839
We can also offer 'em protection
from the things they don't like.

81
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,599
You ever touch my family...

82
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,070
...ever...

83
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,319
York.

84
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,635
Lincoln.

85
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:17,034
- Lincoln?
- Hm.

86
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,310
Tranmere Rovers.

87
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,760
Hm?

88
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,359
Mm-hm.

89
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,430
- Bye, Finn.
- Goodbye, brother.

90
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,150
Shit.

91
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,992
It's all right, Mrs Connors.
You can carry on. It's just my brother.

92
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,195
So tell me how it happened?

93
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,436
They were sleeping downstairs.

94
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,151
And then my husband came home...

95
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,159
...drunk from the Marquis,
even though he just lost his job.

96
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,600
We don't have any money.

97
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,795
Anyway, he came to bed.

98
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,877
But downstairs,
they must have heard a noise.

99
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,035
They woke up.

100
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,992
They started, er, calling out.

101
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,832
They woke my husband up, and...

102
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,276
...when he's drunk, you don't wake him up.

103
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,910
What happened then, Mrs Connors?

104
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,039
He, erm...

105
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,878
He...

106
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,399
He went downstairs.

107
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,950
He killed them.

108
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,553
Strangled them. All three of them.

109
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,873
And you've, erm... You've...you've brought
their bodies here today with you.

110
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,037
Proof, Mr Shelby.

111
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,989
Their singing was the only pretty thing
in my life.

112
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,553
I don't care my husband beats me...

113
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,519
...but not this.

114
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,154
Mrs Connors.

115
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,350
We have your address.

116
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,836
We will speak to your husband.

117
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,758
My brother here

118
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,917
will go to the Bull Ring market today,

119
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,475
and buy you three new goldfinches,

120
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,671
and have them delivered
to your door.

121
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,235
The same colours
and, you know, feathers.

122
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,433
The new ones I will call
Thomas, Arthur and Finn.

123
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,478
That'll make him pause,

124
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,318
even when he's drunk.

125
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,800
Good day, Mr Shelby.

126
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,399
You take care, Mrs Connors.

127
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,635
Bye.

128
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,509
I don't know how you do this, Tom.
I really don't!

129
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,756
You learn things, Arthur.

130
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,718
That woman
has only two rooms downstairs.

131
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:13,549
Her husband has lost his job
and he beats her.

132
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,035
And yet, the thing that brings her

133
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,994
to see her Member of Parliament
is songbirds.

134
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,951
Now, that's politics, Arthur.

135
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,798
It's not for me.

136
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,990
Anyway, look.

137
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,554
That list of losers.

138
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,398
How much have we made
on the football?

139
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,956
Ten grand this week.
Finn showing promise, Tom.

140
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,753
Maybe we should put him
on the tracks.

141
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,871
Just a thought.

142
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,150
- Finn.
- Yeah.

143
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,317
- Your lunchtime delivery.
- Bring her in.

144
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,679
Tommy, the next fella
wants to see both of you.

145
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,034
- Do you know his face?
- No. He's Chinese.

146
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,192
Chinese in our pub?

147
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,990
Tom...

148
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,515
All right.

149
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,439
Slowly, Micky, let him in.

150
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:21,438
Three little birds, eh,
Tommy, Finn and Arthur.

151
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,829
Mr Thomas.

152
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,510
Mr Arthur.

153
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,957
My name is Brilliant Chang.

154
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,238
Brilliant Chang is dead.

155
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,680
Perhaps.

156
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,838
Sometimes I wonder,

157
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,075
"Is this heaven?"

158
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,555
Doesn't smell like heaven...

159
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,320
...50 I would say I have survived.

160
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,679
- What happened to Maggie?
- You don't like me?

161
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,112
I like everything.

162
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,434
I like fucking everything.

163
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,071
You should answer the phone, Mr Shelby.

164
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,556
Micky, bring that phone here now.

165
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,230
Hello?

166
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,158
Arthur! Arthur!

167
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,034
I sent a woman with a gun
to your youngest brother's office.

168
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,639
All right, Finn.

169
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,955
Right right.

170
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,398
What the fuck is going on?

171
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,909
Do you want to die again, Chang? Huh?

172
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,189
Good.

173
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,197
The guns are pointed.

174
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,755
Now we are all concentrating.

175
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,678
The moment is now pure.

176
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,030
Purity is not necessary.

177
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,754
Displays are not necessary.

178
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,398
They said, "Tommy Shelby.
That door will need some kicking down."

179
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,960
When you walked through that door,
it was open.

180
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,834
You don't need to do anything
to get my attention.

181
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,713
Now, what exactly do you want?

182
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,834
Do you have a match, Mr Shelby?

183
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,153
Anything happens to my brother, Chang...

184
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,918
...you die.

185
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,473
If you die here today,
we'll bury you face down with no hands.

186
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:12,639
- You'll go straight to hell.
- I don't care about rituals.

187
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,797
I am a rationalist, Mr Shelby.

188
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,116
Well, tell your friend on the phone

189
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,312
to put her gun down
and we can all have a talk.

190
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,795
Hold your fire, brother!

191
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,638
Hold your fire!

192
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,949
I'm all right.

193
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,639
She fired into the ceiling.

194
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,637
Finn's all right.

195
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,034
Finn's OK.

196
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:52,280
Give me your order! Mm.

197
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,913
Give me your order, Tommy!

198
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,075
Yes or no.

199
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,349
At ease.

200
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,875
I said at ease.

201
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,029
May I take something
from my pocket, Mr Shelby?

202
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,271
And it's the purest opium
that has ever arrived in Europe.

203
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:01,189
No salt, no flour, no lies.

204
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,516
Pure truth.

205
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,955
Came off a ship called the Capital,

206
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,718
out of Shanghai.

207
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,672
Docked at Poplar a week ago.

208
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,751
The stevedores
were held at gunpoint,

209
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,874
Chinese unloaded the cargo
by the light of lanterns.

210
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:24,116
A foreman at the dock estimated there was
seven tonnes of the stuff.

211
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,232
I made a note at the time.

212
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,713
I spoke to that particular foreman

213
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,070
and I worked out that

214
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,989
seven tonnes of pure opium crystals
would be worth...

215
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,479
...approximately, £1,190,000

216
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,318
on international markets.

217
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,957
The big crash. Hm?

218
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,078
Wall Street.

219
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,919
Now we all keep our ears open
for opportunities.

220
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,155
- What the fuck is going on?
- What are you playing at?

221
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,352
Finn, we are conducting
a piece of business.

222
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,357
She had a gun to my fucking head!

223
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,475
But your trousers are dry.

224
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,749
You didn't piss yourself.

225
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,917
- He didn't piss himself, Arthur.
- Well done, Finn.

226
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,476
You had a dispute with a lady
and you didn't piss yourself.

227
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,194
And Arthur here tells me
we should put you on the tracks.

228
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,357
Gonna be a good day for you after all,
Finn.

229
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,754
Give me that!

230
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,029
Hey!

231
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,710
Always have your whores
searched at the door.

232
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,150
If I see that bitch on the street,
I'll fucking cut her.

233
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,476
Yeah, all right. All right, come on.

234
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,357
This is a gift, Mr Shelby.

235
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,396
A gesture of goodwill.

236
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,634
I'll throw it in the canal.

237
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,877
Canals are the idea. Right, Chang?

238
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,673
I'm sorry for calling the meeting here,
but the location is part of the deal.

239
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,155
What fucking deal?

240
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,557
How does it feel
to be barefoot in the mud again, Pol?

241
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,798
It makes me feel young.
What fucking deal?

242
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,990
Four boats.

243
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:54,031
Four days.

244
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,549
Up the Grand Union from Poplar to here.

245
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:01,311
Half the cargo is coal
and underneath the coal,

246
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,794
pure opium crystal.

247
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,991
Opium.

248
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,269
I vote against it.

249
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,800
They can't use trucks

250
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,480
because the Chinese drivers
get stopped by the police.

251
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,829
They need to get it out of London

252
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,429
because all the warehouses
are being searched by Customs.

253
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,871
The seven tonnes
is bound for San Francisco,

254
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,958
but the outward ship doesn't sail
for seven days from Liverpool.

255
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,639
They need somewhere safe to store it.

256
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,719
All we have to do is take it up the canal
and keep it here for a week.

257
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:31,310
We don't fuck with the Chinese, though,
Tom. Dad always said it.

258
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,070
Ask yourself, would he turn down £250,000

259
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,510
to drive four boats up the canal

260
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,551
with no prospect of inspection?

261
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,276
I vote against it, Tom. Hm.

262
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,357
- Mm-mm.
- Polly?

263
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,994
£250,000.

264
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,715
That's half of what Michael lost
in Chicago.

265
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,878
I will ask him to take charge
of this business.

266
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,560
Michael's position will be reinstated
in the company?

267
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:00,479
His period of quarantine would be over.

268
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,315
Think about it, brother.

269
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,829
Four boats sailing up the cut,

270
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,315
smelling of wood smoke and bacon.

271
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,595
And which one
of Charlie's Gypsy didicoy friends

272
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,237
do you trust, Tom, eh,
with a cargo worth £1 million?

273
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,590
I've already made provision.
I'm needed at a meeting.

274
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,710
Let's vote.

275
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,550
Those in favour.

276
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:42,591
Motion carried.
Arthur, tell Charlie we need four boats

277
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,360
and four tonnes of coal
before it gets dark.

278
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,914
They sail south tonight.

279
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,911
And don't forget to go to the Bull Ring
and get them three songbirds, Arthur.

280
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,189
Yes, Tommy.

281
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,469
Fuck!

282
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,634
What have you heard, Pol?

283
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,156
The man you cut went to the police...

284
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,394
...but we dealt with it.

285
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,795
Is she with him?

286
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,478
If she was, it would be your fault,
Arthur.

287
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:33,275
But they say his face is so badly cut
he's hard to look at.

288
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,755
So I would say not.

289
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:42,115
I would also say
it is time to give up on Linda,

290
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,918
find someone else
who might be able to put your fires out.

291
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,712
I can't, though, Pol.

292
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,039
I fucking can't!

293
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,199
And that's it.

294
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,710
That's it.

295
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,673
Whiskey?

296
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,029
Thank you, no.

297
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,876
For reasons I can't divulge,
I need to keep Jimmy McCavern alive.

298
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,913
I've already got a time and a place
for the killing.

299
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,156
You see?

300
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,951
A little alleyway by a shipyard canteen.

301
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,311
A girl called Karen who hates him,
who will give him up.

302
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:05,196
I have the sound of cranes and winches
to cover the gunshot.

303
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,914
I've got a Bentley to get me away.

304
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,872
The war with the Billy Boys is postponed.

305
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,277
We've made peace.
We're gonna do business together.

306
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:16,233
When that business is done,
he's all yours.

307
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,831
You can avenge the death of your son
in any way you see fit.

308
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,951
You mean when you say.

309
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,071
When you check
that little stopwatch you've got

310
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,158
that controls the turning of the Earth.

311
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,230
Yeah.

312
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,351
And then you will marry
and you will settle.

313
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,710
Marry? Marry who, Mr Shelby?

314
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,356
Just let me understand you.

315
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,552
Do you mean
that Polly is part of this deal?

316
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,598
Yeah.

317
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,110
Well, Holy Lord God,
Tommy Shelby OBE,

318
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,550
does your vanity have no limits?

319
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,830
I believe it is called the ego these days.

320
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,155
I read books.

321
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,796
You sit on your throne
and you instruct Polly Gray,

322
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,513
who is of far richer blood than you,

323
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:08,439
as to when she can
and when she can't marry.

324
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,836
Oh, no, she instructs herself.

325
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,997
She has her own strategies.

326
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,519
And we are of the same blood.

327
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:19,396
She will marry you, but only if you agree
to postpone any attack on McCavern

328
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,113
until this business is done.

329
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,711
So she ls some young Gypsy bride
that's yours to give away.

330
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,674
Young she is,
when she's barefoot on the cobbles.

331
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,872
What about a dowry, then, Mr Shelby?
If it's gonna be done in the old way,

332
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,277
well, you know, you throw in
a few coloured ponies or...

333
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,471
I'm having an event at my house.

334
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,113
You are invited.

335
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,151
Polly will be there.

336
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:45,716
There will be candles and violins

337
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,160
and dancing.

338
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:50,511
Polly wants you to propose
in the proper way,

339
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,950
and then she will give you
her terms of acceptance.

340
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,436
Inviting you for this purpose
was Polly"s idea.

341
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,879
- You can't read?
- I don't read.

342
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,798
- It's Swan Lake.
- Ballet?

343
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,115
Yeah.

344
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,356
Apparently, it's about love.

345
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:13,630
Polly says that, for now,

346
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,717
love must defeat revenge.

347
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,156
...As a result of the greed and the excess

348
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:46,480
of a small number of bankers, financiers
and other feckless gamblers.

349
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,359
This comprehensive document,

350
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,235
pleading for Government intervention
in all areas of economic life,

351
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:56,432
represents not just socialism,

352
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,394
but a new breed of National Socialism.

353
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:05,635
And I believe... I believe
that the leaders of my own party

354
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,832
have been very foolish to reject it.

355
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,510
How on earth did you get a ballet company
to come to your bloody house?

356
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,758
It's an independent dance company

357
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,191
dedicated to bringing ballet
to the people.

358
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,038
We share a philosophy.

359
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,309
I'm a patron.

360
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,559
I also gave them a lot of money.

361
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:11,909
Oh.

362
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,678
And this date

363
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,632
is your wife's birthday.

364
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,949
Yeah.

365
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,597
The party is for her.

366
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:28,230
And she likes ballet, your wife?

367
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,589
Why wouldn't she?

368
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,439
It's just...

369
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,676
Well, you see,
I did some research into her.

370
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,433
Into her past.

371
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:48,632
If you want to buy her a gift,
she likes diamonds.

372
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,234
Now that we are going to be
conquering the world together,

373
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,715
we need to have no secrets.

374
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,275
We should know
each other's weaknesses.

375
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,034
Your wife has led an interesting life.

376
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,959
It may even be possible that,
as a younger man in Birmingham,

377
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,037
I came across her.

378
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:18,193
My friends and I would sometimes go
to nightclubs in the south of town.

379
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,309
Well, if you recognise her,
maybe you can talk about old times, eh?

380
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,517
Maybe, if we have met before,
your wife and I

381
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,677
could even renew our acquaintance.

382
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,916
I am invited to stay the night, yes?

383
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:40,351
I too have done some research,
Sir Oswald.

384
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,155
Yeah.

385
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:47,877
I researched your wife
and your wife's younger sister

386
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,152
and your wife's stepmother, Lady Curzon,

387
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,999
all of whom you are fucking.

388
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,873
If such things were to take place
on a narrowboat,

389
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,752
the Church would get involved.

390
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:00,995
But...

391
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,636
...it's not happening on a narrowboat.

392
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:11,354
No. It's taking place in your apartment,
in your country house,

393
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:16,793
sometimes even in your office
here in the House of Commons.

394
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,229
So no secrets. And, yes,

395
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,476
yes, you are invited to stay the night

396
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:26,195
with whichever member of your family
finds favour.

397
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,039
Now, if you don't mind,
I was about to leave,

398
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,470
I need to lock up my office.

399
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,753
Actually, I will come alone.

400
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,159
In society, you are judged
by your hospitality.

401
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,078
I will expect adventure.

402
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,873
Such rogues we are, aren't we?

403
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,038
Sing like songbirds in the House.

404
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,958
And then, afterwards,

405
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,311
relieve ourselves in the bodies
of whomever we choose.

406
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,835
Two men for whom forbidding is forbidden.

407
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,800
It should be quite the party.

408
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:07,111
You have to listen to the voices
that you hear.

409
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,833
Do what they tell you to do.

410
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,798
You don't even have to rub the lamp
any more to summon the genie.

411
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,910
It wasn't the blue stone, Tommy.

412
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,510
It was you.

413
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,030
It was you.

414
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,510
Who is it?

415
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,278
It's Tommy's car outside.

416
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,118
It's him. I'll get it.

417
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,439
What's happened?

418
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,756
Nothing's happened. I'm all right.

419
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,870
Come in.

420
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,440
Do you want a drink?

421
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,597
- No?

422
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,360
No. I have some information
for the intelligence officer...

423
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,910
...on conversations with Mosley.

424
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:14,476
He's planning to put forward proposals
for building works.

425
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,718
He wants the Communists to consider
his new party as fraternal,

426
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,310
which means his activities
are now part of your official remit? Yeah?

427
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,273
Mr Shelby, it's 2 am.
You can make your report any time.

428
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,960
- Why don't you stay tonight?
- No.

429
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,752
I'll leave you two to...

430
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,473
Yes, good night.

431
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,039
I stood on a bridge tonight, Ada.

432
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,310
And I looked down.

433
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,919
And Grace was there...

434
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:02,675
...but she was still alive.

435
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,632
Tom, have you still been taking laudanum?

436
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,831
<i>The fucking name of the barge
was the January.</i>

437
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,673
Our dad's boat.

438
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,440
The boat I was born on.
We've never got nothing.

439
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,836
We've never got nothing.
And we never fucking will.

440
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:22,596
Dr Brooke said that you never arrived
for your appointment, Tom.

441
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,154
No.

442
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,954
There's nothing in his books
of any use to a man like me.

443
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,354
They talk about guilt.

444
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,834
Eh?

445
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,871
Guilt! What fucking guilt?

446
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,674
- The black barge.
- No. No, that's not it.

447
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,677
That's not it. He had it right.

448
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,919
Mosley had it right.
He said, "Forbidding is forbidden to us.

449
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,476
"We can do anything.
Nothing can stop us.”

450
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,274
But there's a part of me
that is unfamiliar to myself.

451
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,039
And I keep finding myself there.

452
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,953
And only the January can get me away.

453
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,717
Will you at least try
the doctors again, Tom?

454
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,591
Well, then at least throw away your opium.

455
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,233
It's that that causes the visions.

456
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,998
Just...throw it away.

457
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,918
While it's there, it's a temptation.

458
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,475
- How much have you got left?

459
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,040
Seven tonnes.

460
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:21,391
- Seven tonnes?
- Yeah.

461
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,553
I'd hate for it to run out, Ada.

462
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,509
You do me a favour?

463
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:49,231
When that kid of yours arrives,
keep it away from me.

464
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,872
A fucking ballet.

465
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,719
He wants to impress someone.

466
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,478
And I'm invited?

467
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,795
You and Gina.

468
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,630
Why?

469
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,717
Because he wants to give you
the chance to come back properly.

470
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,510
Coal haulage?

471
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,869
Yeah.

472
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,039
Tommy wants you to reopen those books
and become managing director.

473
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,596
So I've come back from Detroit
to become a coal man?

474
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:48,596
The first delivery
is bound for San Francisco,

475
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,154
but if it works...

476
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,914
...Tommy thinks he can find
distribution for it here.

477
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,159
And this, erm, this coal...

478
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,237
- ...is it snow white?
- No.

479
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,874
Golden brown.

480
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,550
Fuck.

481
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,036
This is your opportunity, Michael.

482
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,471
There is more money in this
than there is

483
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,673
in all the other parts of our business
put together.

484
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,156
Tommy knows
what opium does to people.

485
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,749
Tommy knows
what whiskey does to people.

486
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,951
He got an OBE for selling it.

487
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,033
I'll speak to Gina.

488
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,919
You'll what?

489
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,509
I will consult my wife.

490
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,834
Your father ran this business
for a bit.

491
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,758
1901.

492
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,632
And he shipped coal. Real coal.

493
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,398
Just coal.

494
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:08,755
And his fingernails and his eyelids
and his ears were black with it.

495
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,474
And the merchants would offer them
one price

496
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,432
and then only pay half

497
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,358
because they could.

498
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,120
And that was wrong, Michael.

499
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:46,271
Run your hands through it,
get it under your skin...

500
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,390
...and then see if Gina will let you
lay a finger on her.

501
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,353
I think golden brown
is more to her taste.

502
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,712
Especially when you tell her
how much money you're going to earn.

503
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,949
Now we're in business together,
I should ask,

504
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:36,198
which foot do you kick the ball with,
Mr Shelby?

505
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,469
I have no religion.

506
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,234
Some nights I wish I had.

507
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,470
He's kin?

508
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,630
Yeah.

509
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,394
And the simple fellow?

510
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,149
He's a lot less simple
than you might at first think.

511
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,115
Do you trust them?

512
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,158
Right. So I take a boatload.

513
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,594
No.

514
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,429
Ten sacks to start with,
so you can test the market.

515
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,631
Then we'll deal in boatloads.

516
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,320
Cash payment on loading.

517
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,589
£10,000.

518
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,430
For that amount,
it'll have to be a cheque.

519
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,755
I don't take cheques.

520
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,714
It'll be a cheque.

521
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,510
I will take a cheque

522
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,870
if it's guaranteed
by our mutual friend in London,

523
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,990
Mr Mosley.

524
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,390
Well, who would've thought
I'd be doing business

525
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,399
with fucking Gypsy Catholic scum?

526
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,991
Yeah, who'd have thought,
eh, Charlie?

527
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,599
Who would have thought it?

528
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,030
Aye, but you're OK.

529
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,630
Yeah, I'm only OK
until I'm not OK.

530
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,876
Then I'm really not.

531
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:11,480
Delivery in seven days.

532
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,995
Cheque guaranteed.

533
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:18,397
Won't your Chinese friends
expect the seven tonnes that leaves London

534
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,830
to still be seven tonnes
when it reaches Liverpool?

535
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,679
You leave that to me, Mr McCavern.

536
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:27,509
Oh, you mean you're bold enough to skim the Chinese?

537
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,118
You have some kind of death wish,
Mr Shelby?

538
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:54,112
An evening with a tribe of Gypsies.

539
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,720
When you've unpacked,
there should be a girl laid on for you.

540
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:02,480
Mr Shelby is a socialist

541
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,989
and believes in equality of service
for all classes.

542
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:19,952
According to the invitation,
there'll be an interval at nine o'clock.

543
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,071
Say that you're feeling tired
and we'll leave.

544
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,719
Well, if you see a duke,
introduce me.

545
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,831
My God, at last!

546
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,871
Something you like about England.

547
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,713
Gina, I've been made an offer.

548
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,556
To come back into the company.

549
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,954
Michael, we agreed,

550
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,913
the baby will be born in New York.
Remember?

551
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,235
The job is haulage.

552
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,959
Supply. Transport.

553
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,950
Opium.

554
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,789
- Tommy has made contact...
- Tommy!

555
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,514
Tommy has made contact
with Chinese suppliers

556
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,438
who have plantations in the Afghan hills.

557
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,150
Pure grade.

558
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,192
We will take delivery
and ship it all over Europe.

559
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:16,950
You mean heroin?

560
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,030
Yes.

561
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,593
And how much would you make?

562
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,834
Conservative estimate,
three shipments a year from Shanghai,

563
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,473
seven tonnes each,

564
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,160
stand to make approximately
£1 million.

565
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,270
Per annum.

566
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,913
The company will make three.

567
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,515
We could go to New York
whenever we wanted.

568
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,075
On our own fucking plane.

569
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,552
- We always have to come back, right?
- Yes.

570
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,637
For £1 million a year, we do.

571
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,240
What happens if you get caught?

572
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,430
Tommy has friends.

573
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,398
If the ship gets stopped,
it'll be the Chinese who hang.

574
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,238
Think about it, Gina.

575
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,352
When we move into our house...

576
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:21,349
...our room for entertaining
will be twice this size.

577
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,310
Will it now?

578
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,836
The magazines say that

579
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:35,157
it's all straight lines and simplicity
in the 1930s.

580
00:43:36,760 --> 00:43:37,795
Deco is dead.

581
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,153
We'll be able to afford
dukes and duchesses.

582
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,758
And maybe...

583
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:49,473
...maybe a princess or two.

584
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,910
And the painting on the wall
will be of you.

585
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,234
Because Tommy Shelby will be gone

586
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,113
and it will be Michael Gray
arranging the ballet.

587
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,715
Where will Tommy be?

588
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,519
Where he wants to go to most.

589
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,959
Ah.

590
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,590
There.

591
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,830
A lord.

592
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,998
Actually, I think Mr Mosley's a baronet.

593
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:30,032
Where the fuck is Tommy anyway?

594
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,070
Tommy...

595
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,555
My house.

596
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,990
- My wife.

597
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:53,269
Let them wait.

598
00:44:58,120 --> 00:44:59,110
Sir Oswald.

599
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:04,234
Do I not get announced?

600
00:45:04,360 --> 00:45:05,794
Mr Shelby asked me to tell you

601
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,072
that he's busy
with the catering preparations

602
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,032
and will be joining you shortly.

603
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,029
In the meantime,
and while you're waiting,

604
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:18,278
we have opium, cocaine and brandy.

605
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,431
I don't use opium or cocaine,

606
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:26,200
and brandy is for after dinner,
not before.

607
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:31,430
I also have a list of options
for the end of the evening.

608
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:35,030
You'll notice that
the maids wear name tags.

609
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,998
We hired them specially...

610
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:42,039
...for those guests staying the night.

611
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,438
All things are available
except the ballerinas.

612
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,031
And who, might I ask, are you?

613
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,674
I am a queen amongst the Romanies.

614
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:59,429
And I too am unavailable.

615
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,354
Lizzie.

616
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,757
There's something I didn't tell you
about this evening.

617
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,598
Something about our guest.

618
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,119
Mosley.

619
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,672
It's possible that...

620
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,598
...that you've met him before.

621
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:24,710
Before when?

622
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:29,435
Before you became who you are.

623
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,395
Would you even remember him?

624
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,318
Would he remember you?

625
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,558
All I remember is,
I drank too much champagne.

626
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,193
I wasn't taking cash.

627
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:47,590
Lizzie...

628
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,119
There's a pile of bodies...

629
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,475
...floating by.

630
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,675
Let 'em go, Lizzie.

631
00:46:58,560 --> 00:46:59,755
Let 'em go.

632
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,711
So that's why you brought me
in here.

633
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,513
To lay your claim.

634
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,470
Yeah.

635
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,357
Well, it's a start, I suppose.

636
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:24,630
He lays a fucking hand on you,
he will be meat for Johnny Dogs.

637
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,832
You were indisposed when I arrived.

638
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:43,391
In society, you greet a guest,
you don't leave them hanging...

639
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,670
...looking around like a fucking dog.

640
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:49,873
Before we join the others, I have some business.

641
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,274
I need a signature.

642
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,836
By the way,
your brandy before dinner thing amuses me,

643
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,600
but none of the maids are of interest.

644
00:47:57,720 --> 00:47:59,870
And I despise the use of drugs.

645
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:03,958
Your strategies are very transparent.

646
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,352
I'm involved in a transaction
with Jimmy McCavern,

647
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,835
your acquaintance from the north.

648
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,997
I have no idea who you mean.

649
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:15,430
I don't trust him.
He wants to pay by cheque.

650
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,951
I need your signature
as a guarantor on the transaction

651
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,832
should his cheque fail to be honoured.

652
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,871
The sum is £10,000.

653
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,071
And what is it he's buying from you?

654
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,270
A gin distillery.

655
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,311
He's buying my old one.
I'm buying a new one.

656
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,635
Hmm.

657
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,833
So not only is the truce holding,

658
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,429
but you two
are actually doing business.

659
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,154
Yeah. But I still don't trust his cheques.

660
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,071
If I sign a cheque guarantee
for this man,

661
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,840
it is proof of a connection
between me and him.

662
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,190
Something you could later use
against me.

663
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,597
Why would I want to move against you?

664
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,311
You're curious about my weaknesses.

665
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:19,552
And you've learned it's not cocaine,

666
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,398
not maids.

667
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:35,511
But now you will learn my weakness
is a tendency to trust people.

668
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,039
Do you have a pen?

669
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,110
Mr Shelby.

670
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:58,191
I know you have no classical education,

671
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:01,392
but just realised you are
the perfect balance between the gods

672
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,477
Dionysus and Apollo.

673
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:07,753
Irrational frenzy
controlled by reason and self reflection.

674
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:13,720
Do you know the work
of Friedrich Nietzsche?

675
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:15,672
- Freud?

676
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,120
Yes.

677
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:18,719
Ah.

678
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:24,875
There.

679
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,230
Your guarantee of trust.

680
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,277
Now perhaps you would introduce me
to your wonderful wife.

681
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,077
So, did you know?

682
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,873
What?

683
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,230
Oh, that tonight's special guest
might have fucked you

684
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,431
when you were a nightclub hostess?

685
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:46,550
Yeah.

686
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:51,034
Lizzie, if we were to strike
from our guest lists

687
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,595
every man in Birmingham who you...

688
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,151
- Yes or no?
- Fucking yes.

689
00:50:58,280 --> 00:50:59,270
Shit.

690
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:06,676
Sir Oswald,
this is my wife Elizabeth.

691
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:08,677
Lizzie, Sir Oswald Mosley.

692
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,673
Since we all appear to know,

693
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:15,030
and since knowledge is permission,

694
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:19,233
I'm sure, Mr Shelby, in the spirit
of our honest relationship,

695
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,033
you won't mind me saying

696
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:23,879
it was a bottle of Champagne
and an evening well spent.

697
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,753
Actually, it was an evening wasted.

698
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,994
For the Champagne
and brandy you bought me,

699
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:37,432
as I recall, it was the booze that put you
to sleep a little prematurely.

700
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:42,350
Ladies and gentlemen, the dance is about to begin.

701
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,791
Mr Mosley!

702
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:51,116
A toast, if I may.

703
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,754
To the end of our deal,

704
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,269
and the beginning of something more.

705
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:58,198
Happy Birthday, Lizzie.

706
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,710
This way.

707
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:35,117
Polly Gray, Gypsy queen,

708
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:36,878
will you marry me,

709
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,389
a poor commoner who loves you?

710
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:40,389
Let's fuck before the swan dies.

711
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:13,953
I heard there was a family occasion.

712
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:20,351
Look, I'm sorry, Linda.

713
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,949
That animal inside me,

714
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:25,640
it comes out and I can't stop it.

715
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:29,312
Fuck, Linda.

716
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,158
Without you, I ...

717
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,271
Come inside, please.

718
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,992
His name was Frederick.

719
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,430
All we ever did was talk, Arthur.

720
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:40,880
He just listened.

721
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:44,597
And now he has no face.

722
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,110
He's as ugly on the outside
as you are on the inside.

723
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,951
May you Peaky Blinders all rot...

724
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,599
...in fucking hell.

725
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,834
- Arthur...
