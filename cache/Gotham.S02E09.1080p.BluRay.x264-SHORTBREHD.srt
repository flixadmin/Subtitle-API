1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:03,254
<i>Previously on</i>
Gotham...

2
00:00:03,546 --> 00:00:04,714
Father Creel.

3
00:00:06,758 --> 00:00:07,759
<i>Do you have the Wayne boy?</i>

4
00:00:07,926 --> 00:00:11,680
Not yet. There are some practical matters
that have to be resolved first.

5
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:13,932
Oh!

6
00:00:15,433 --> 00:00:17,394
- Mr. Penguin?
- Help me.

7
00:00:17,769 --> 00:00:20,814
This is the name of the man
who killed your parents.

8
00:00:21,064 --> 00:00:22,107
<i>Sell me your company.</i>

9
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:24,109
I will give you this as a signing gift.

10
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:26,152
I've been a very bad girl.

11
00:00:26,361 --> 00:00:27,904
<i>You're a good woman.
You're just sick.</i>

12
00:00:31,783 --> 00:00:33,952
I knew you still had feelings for me.

13
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:35,286
I want to show you something.

14
00:00:35,453 --> 00:00:36,496
You're under arrest!

15
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:39,249
<i>May I ask what the charge is?</i>

16
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:41,626
The kidnapping
and torture of Aubrey James.

17
00:00:41,793 --> 00:00:42,836
<i>No!</i>

18
00:00:43,044 --> 00:00:44,295
Tell me who killed them!

19
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,798
Can you believe it still fits?

20
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:51,010
Don't make me kill you.

21
00:00:51,261 --> 00:00:52,554
Do it, Jim. Do me.

22
00:00:53,138 --> 00:00:54,139
Kill him!

23
00:00:56,349 --> 00:00:57,684
- It's over.
- Not yet.

24
00:01:01,438 --> 00:01:02,439
Hold on.

25
00:01:02,647 --> 00:01:04,649
I love you, baby.

26
00:01:04,858 --> 00:01:06,317
No!

27
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,013
All right, three bucks.

28
00:01:35,305 --> 00:01:36,306
Okay.

29
00:01:52,197 --> 00:01:54,282
Morning. Help you?

30
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,577
I was told to order a Highsmith Royale.

31
00:01:58,536 --> 00:01:59,788
Bit early, don't you think?

32
00:02:00,497 --> 00:02:01,873
I said "Highsmith Royale."

33
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,541
No ice.

34
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:33,571
<i>Here you go, ma'am. You're up.</i>

35
00:02:44,582 --> 00:02:45,875
How may I help you?

36
00:02:46,793 --> 00:02:49,212
I need somebody killed,
and I heard that you employ the best.

37
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:52,590
- Oh, yes! I know you.
<i>- One more round over here, please.</i>

38
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:54,926
Our illustrious mayor's sister.

39
00:02:55,134 --> 00:02:57,262
Or should I say "ex-mayor"?

40
00:02:57,929 --> 00:03:00,348
Word is,
you're quite the deadeye yourself.

41
00:03:01,516 --> 00:03:02,642
Why come to us?

42
00:03:03,268 --> 00:03:05,061
Had an accident. My aim is off.

43
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:08,857
Is this business? Personal?

44
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:10,024
What's it matter to you?

45
00:03:10,191 --> 00:03:14,070
Personal costs extra.
There's always complications.

46
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:15,947
It's business.

47
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:17,824
A cop.

48
00:03:18,575 --> 00:03:23,454
Seems personal to me.
Anyhow, cops also cost extra.

49
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:26,958
Fine. I want it done today.

50
00:03:29,836 --> 00:03:31,212
What kind of guarantee do I get?

51
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:34,173
I accept a job, the job gets done. Period.

52
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,843
You see, I believe in the beauty
of extreme measures.

53
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,012
So, who's the lucky fellow?

54
00:03:51,774 --> 00:03:54,319
Ms. Kean has yet
to regain consciousness.

55
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:59,490
With this kind of trauma, we have no
idea when she might wake up.

56
00:04:01,492 --> 00:04:02,493
If ever.

57
00:04:03,912 --> 00:04:07,665
But the medical wing at Arkham
is fully equipped to handle her condition.

58
00:04:09,626 --> 00:04:11,044
Will you be riding over with her?

59
00:04:13,046 --> 00:04:14,088
No.

60
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,018
Hello, sleepyhead.

61
00:04:29,646 --> 00:04:30,688
Where am I?

62
00:04:30,855 --> 00:04:33,983
Rapid movement and elevated heart rate are
counterproductive to the healing process.

63
00:04:35,777 --> 00:04:37,320
- Don't kill--
- Apologies in advance.

64
00:04:44,994 --> 00:04:46,371
Rest up, my feathered friend.

65
00:04:47,705 --> 00:04:49,290
We have a big night ahead of us.

66
00:05:02,887 --> 00:05:03,930
Looking for this?

67
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:06,891
Thank you.

68
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:08,851
You left before I woke up.

69
00:05:09,185 --> 00:05:10,728
I know. I couldn't sleep.

70
00:05:11,187 --> 00:05:13,189
- Was I snoring?
- No.

71
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:16,567
Are you sure?
My big, loud, rumbling, barnyard snore.

72
00:05:16,734 --> 00:05:19,153
I've heard complaints.
Neighbors. Airplanes.

73
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,363
You don't snore.

74
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,076
Look. I'm glad Galavan's been arrested.

75
00:05:26,452 --> 00:05:28,162
But he should pay
for everything he's done.

76
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,708
I'm on my way to meet Barnes
at Galavan's penthouse.

77
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:35,712
Hopefully, we can find some evidence
to corroborate Aubrey James' testimony.

78
00:05:36,045 --> 00:05:38,256
I got a call.
They're transferring Barbara to Arkham.

79
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:41,592
I know. I stopped by Gotham General.

80
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,639
You went to see her?

81
00:05:46,806 --> 00:05:49,642
She's a witness against Galavan.
I wanted to check on her condition.

82
00:05:49,809 --> 00:05:51,602
"Her condition" is she's in a coma.

83
00:05:54,063 --> 00:05:55,732
We never talked about what happened

84
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:57,483
with you and Barbara in
that interrogation room.

85
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,610
I know. Tonight?

86
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:01,612
Sure. Tonight. Or right now.

87
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:04,323
Lee, I went over to see her as part
of the case against Galavan.

88
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,575
That is it.

89
00:06:05,742 --> 00:06:06,909
This isn't jealousy.

90
00:06:07,285 --> 00:06:08,786
That woman is...

91
00:06:09,704 --> 00:06:10,705
How do I put this?

92
00:06:10,872 --> 00:06:12,874
She's the devil. No, she is.
She's the devil.

93
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:16,502
Lee, do you think I wanted things
to go the way they did?

94
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:19,047
I had to play her game.

95
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:21,382
I know. All right, forget about Barbara.

96
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:23,426
Most people fight their dark side.

97
00:06:23,676 --> 00:06:26,012
Lately you find ways to give into it.

98
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:30,641
That's a problem. For you and for us.

99
00:06:31,267 --> 00:06:33,770
I know. I hear you.

100
00:06:34,562 --> 00:06:36,314
Can we please just not
talk about this right now?

101
00:06:36,481 --> 00:06:37,482
I'm late to meet Barnes.

102
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:39,942
I'll be fine.

103
00:06:49,327 --> 00:06:51,245
I wasn't sure
you'd ever want to see me again.

104
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:52,997
When you called...

105
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:56,918
You don't believe
what they're saying about my uncle,

106
00:06:58,336 --> 00:06:59,337
do you?

107
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:02,256
No. Of course not.

108
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:05,551
Silver, I asked you here
because I need your help.

109
00:07:05,885 --> 00:07:07,011
Anything.

110
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:12,517
Before he was arrested, your uncle
made me an offer. I want--

111
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:14,185
Right, Master Bruce! On your feet!

112
00:07:14,352 --> 00:07:16,187
Bought us a lovely couple of rakes
from the ironmongers.

113
00:07:16,521 --> 00:07:17,814
I suggest we get outside and get...

114
00:07:20,691 --> 00:07:21,943
Hello, Ms. St. Cloud.

115
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:25,363
Did not expect to see you here.

116
00:07:25,863 --> 00:07:26,864
Hello, Alfred.

117
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:30,034
That must have been your car
I saw idling on the main road.

118
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:34,580
Now, in light of recent events,
I suggest you get in it and you leave.

119
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:36,541
Immediately.

120
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:39,877
I invited her and I want her to stay.

121
00:07:40,128 --> 00:07:41,129
And I'm ordering her to leave.

122
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:42,630
And it's my house, and I give the orders!

123
00:07:42,797 --> 00:07:43,798
Oh, is that so?

124
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:48,177
It's okay.
I don't want to cause any trouble.

125
00:07:48,344 --> 00:07:50,221
Smart girl. Off you pop.

126
00:07:56,477 --> 00:07:57,728
I'm at the Kane Hotel.

127
00:08:06,404 --> 00:08:07,905
You had no right to do that.

128
00:08:08,281 --> 00:08:09,407
I had every right.

129
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:12,910
What were you thinking,
asking her up here?

130
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:18,958
Wait, you think she was gonna
tell you something?

131
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:23,171
If Galavan really has the name of my
parents' killer in that envelope,

132
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:24,422
it's worth a shot.

133
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:27,091
Well, my guess is, there was
absolutely nothing in that envelope.

134
00:08:27,258 --> 00:08:29,218
It was just a ruse
to get you to sign away the company.

135
00:08:29,385 --> 00:08:30,636
Galavan is smart.

136
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:34,599
He wouldn't enter a multi-billion dollar
offer without his end of the bargain.

137
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:36,934
He has the name.

138
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:39,937
And you think that little minx is
gonna tell you something, do you?

139
00:08:41,272 --> 00:08:42,273
We're friends.

140
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:43,566
No you're not.

141
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,944
Getting information
out of a girl like that

142
00:08:47,153 --> 00:08:50,948
requires a level of deception that you
do not yet possess, Master Bruce.

143
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:54,202
It is too dangerous.

144
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:55,369
It's worth the risk.

145
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,913
No.

146
00:08:58,039 --> 00:09:01,083
You will not see Ms. St. Cloud again

147
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,461
or pursue Galavan's wild claims.

148
00:09:03,628 --> 00:09:05,379
You have no right to make
that decision for me.

149
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:06,672
Well, someone has to.

150
00:09:07,632 --> 00:09:09,342
If you force me to be your jailer,

151
00:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,553
then that is who I will be.

152
00:09:33,199 --> 00:09:34,492
Excuse me. Thank you.

153
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:38,079
Press 56, please.

154
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:45,169
You live here?

155
00:09:47,171 --> 00:09:48,172
No.

156
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:50,174
Me neither.

157
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:52,551
Lady's baby grand is flat, so...

158
00:09:54,345 --> 00:09:56,347
I don't mind making house calls.
I like my work.

159
00:09:58,349 --> 00:09:59,517
You like your work?

160
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:02,520
Yeah. I do.

161
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:04,355
I guess we're lucky.

162
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:09,068
Hmm.

163
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:14,490
Caramel?

164
00:10:15,241 --> 00:10:16,701
No, I'm good.

165
00:10:17,285 --> 00:10:18,577
You're missing out. They're good.

166
00:10:45,855 --> 00:10:47,231
Where the hell is Gordon?

167
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:22,433
- Who is that?
- No idea.

168
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:25,436
But he just tried to kill me.

169
00:11:26,854 --> 00:11:27,897
He tell you why?

170
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,315
It wasn't random.

171
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:32,276
Piano wire. Guy's a pro.

172
00:11:42,787 --> 00:11:43,829
No, wait. Wait!

173
00:12:00,346 --> 00:12:01,430
You feel lucky, Ned?

174
00:12:01,597 --> 00:12:03,057
<i>- All the way, all the way.</i>
<i>- We got this!</i>

175
00:12:03,224 --> 00:12:04,600
<i>Yeah. Here we go.</i>

176
00:12:07,645 --> 00:12:08,646
<i>Listen up.</i>

177
00:12:09,563 --> 00:12:12,983
Who wants a shot
at eighty-sixing one of Gotham's finest?

178
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:17,571
I'm waiving any collateral fines.
Just do what you have to do.

179
00:12:18,406 --> 00:12:20,741
But Jim Gordon doesn't see the sun

180
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:23,077
rise.

181
00:12:42,304 --> 00:12:43,389
You drugged me.

182
00:12:43,848 --> 00:12:45,474
That was for your own benefit,
Mr. Penguin.

183
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,268
You have extensive injuries.

184
00:12:49,103 --> 00:12:50,146
I know you.

185
00:12:50,354 --> 00:12:53,524
Ed. Nygma.

186
00:12:55,359 --> 00:12:56,902
We met once before. At the G.C.P.D.

187
00:12:57,111 --> 00:12:58,154
You're not a cop.

188
00:12:58,362 --> 00:13:00,197
Oh. No, no, no.

189
00:13:00,573 --> 00:13:01,782
No, I'm in forensics.

190
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:06,745
Do you believe in fate?

191
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:08,330
Where are my clothes?

192
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:10,040
Oh, I threw them away. They smelled.

193
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,585
Oh, no. Oh, my...

194
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:14,503
Uh, I'm afraid, sir, that you can't leave.

195
00:13:14,712 --> 00:13:16,338
If you sedate me again, I swear, I will--

196
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:19,216
Sir! You are a wanted man.

197
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,051
You can try and run,

198
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:23,053
but with your condition you'll get
about three blocks.

199
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:25,055
I'm afraid that you're stuck here
until you recover.

200
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:37,234
Now, drink up. It's just water.

201
00:13:37,485 --> 00:13:40,070
Dehydration is common
after prolonged outdoor exposure.

202
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:46,160
What do you want from me?

203
00:13:47,203 --> 00:13:48,871
Remember I had mentioned fate?

204
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:54,543
Recently I've been going through
a sort of change.

205
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,213
What kind of change, you ask?

206
00:13:57,421 --> 00:13:59,256
- I didn't.
- I've started murdering people.

207
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:11,602
Wow. That is thrilling to say out loud.

208
00:14:15,272 --> 00:14:16,315
How many people?

209
00:14:16,482 --> 00:14:17,525
Three in total.

210
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:19,276
Two of them I didn't really care for.

211
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:22,821
But one was my girlfriend, Ms. Kringle.

212
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,116
She was the love of my life.

213
00:14:26,784 --> 00:14:28,953
If you're planning on killing me,
could you get on with it?

214
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,372
At this point, it would come
as a welcome relief.

215
00:14:31,622 --> 00:14:33,791
Oh, Heavens!
No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.

216
00:14:33,999 --> 00:14:36,502
I have no ill intentions toward you.

217
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:37,878
Then what are your intentions?

218
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,800
I need advice, Mr. Penguin.

219
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:48,764
These murders changed me.

220
00:14:50,683 --> 00:14:52,017
And like the butterfly,

221
00:14:52,643 --> 00:14:55,980
I've come to realize that I cannot
be a caterpillar once again.

222
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:58,899
And you're one of the city's most
notorious killers.

223
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:02,152
I brought you here, in part, because

224
00:15:02,611 --> 00:15:05,573
I was hoping you could guide me
on this new path.

225
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:10,995
Listen, friend...

226
00:15:11,161 --> 00:15:12,162
Ed.

227
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,082
Whatever.

228
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:25,259
My empire is in ruins.

229
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:29,597
I'm a wanted man
with no friends.

230
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:33,434
And my mother,

231
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:38,856
the one person I swore to protect,
is dead because of my weakness.

232
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:44,153
Believe me when I tell you
that this path you're on

233
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:46,572
leads to nothing but destruction and pain.

234
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:50,826
So.

235
00:15:52,369 --> 00:15:53,871
Wanted or not,

236
00:15:55,164 --> 00:15:56,165
I'm leaving.

237
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,590
Oh, my.

238
00:16:07,009 --> 00:16:10,429
Rise and shine. Hell with this.

239
00:16:12,931 --> 00:16:16,477
Who sent you? Huh? Who sent you?

240
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:19,313
Your mother.

241
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:23,525
That's what I was hoping you would say.

242
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:27,404
No! What are you doing? No!

243
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:29,740
Talk!

244
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:33,869
Detective Gordon, stand down!
Stand down right now!

245
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:36,330
Parks, watch the perp.

246
00:16:36,497 --> 00:16:37,790
Cortez, you shut the window.

247
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:39,500
Come over here!

248
00:16:44,338 --> 00:16:46,757
You know damn well
I don't tolerate that type of behavior.

249
00:16:47,091 --> 00:16:48,676
And yet you pull that crap
right in front of me?

250
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:49,885
<i>I'm sorry, sir.</i>

251
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:51,345
<i>Are you losing it, Gordon?</i>

252
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:54,098
Has that church incident
messed with your mind?

253
00:16:54,306 --> 00:16:55,307
No, sir.

254
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:58,102
<i>'Cause if I remember correctly,
you disobeying my orders</i>

255
00:16:58,268 --> 00:16:59,895
<i>is what landed you there
in the first place.</i>

256
00:17:00,062 --> 00:17:01,939
<i>I ordered you to turn that car around</i>

257
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:04,608
and you ignored me
and drove straight into an ambush.

258
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:07,277
And ended the day
putting Galavan behind bars.

259
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:09,446
We need to push the boundaries.

260
00:17:09,613 --> 00:17:10,656
<i>Captain!</i>

261
00:17:27,631 --> 00:17:29,758
My employer has a strict protocol.

262
00:17:33,637 --> 00:17:35,889
If the first guy doesn't succeed,

263
00:17:37,141 --> 00:17:39,351
keep sending men until the job is done.

264
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:43,480
None of you is making it
out of here alive.

265
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:55,492
<i>When you get here, move carefully.</i>

266
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:57,786
We don't know how many active skells
we're dealing with.

267
00:17:58,203 --> 00:18:00,581
All right. Two units on the way here.

268
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:02,458
We just have to hold out till
they get here.

269
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,710
Hey, uh, Cortez, kill the lights.

270
00:18:04,877 --> 00:18:07,963
Sir, I'm forensics. I don't have a gun.

271
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,423
Grab something you can use as a weapon

272
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,675
and stay behind us
as best you can, all right?

273
00:18:11,842 --> 00:18:13,844
Parks, take cover behind the desk.

274
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:17,639
Remember your training.
Aim for center mass.

275
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:18,849
Right. Center mass.

276
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:21,351
And don't stop firing until you're sure.
And Parks?

277
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:22,519
Yes, sir?

278
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:23,854
Breathe.

279
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:51,089
Help me!

280
00:18:51,715 --> 00:18:52,883
Drop the knife!

281
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:38,470
- I'm leaving.
- Not gonna happen.

282
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:42,015
Try to stop me.
I'll lop off her pretty little head.

283
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:45,561
You know what I like about those glasses?

284
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:51,775
They look like bull's-eyes.

285
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:55,779
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

286
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:59,283
Okay. We're not gonna hang around
for round two.

287
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:02,119
Everybody load up
and let's get the hell out of here.

288
00:20:02,286 --> 00:20:03,287
I'm not leaving.

289
00:20:04,037 --> 00:20:05,038
That wasn't a request.

290
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:07,791
This place is still our best bet for
evidence against Galavan.

291
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,126
We leave, they'll destroy it.

292
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:10,961
Now you're just looking for a fight.

293
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:14,798
Parks, make sure the staircase is clear.

294
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:19,052
I've got a civilian who's dead

295
00:20:19,511 --> 00:20:21,638
and a rookie
who's scared half out of her mind.

296
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:24,683
You think we're gonna survive the
next attack with just a few handguns?

297
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:26,351
We have to get out of here.

298
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:29,688
Wait.

299
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:37,696
A monk's cassock?

300
00:20:40,782 --> 00:20:41,783
<i>What the hell is this about?</i>

301
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:45,329
I don't know,
but we have to get out of here. Let's go!

302
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:47,581
Captain! Captain!

303
00:20:47,831 --> 00:20:49,625
This could be exactly what
we're looking for.

304
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:50,834
Knife!

305
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:58,383
Captain! Captain! You okay?

306
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:00,552
It's just a scratch.
Let's get out of here.

307
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:01,803
No! No!

308
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:05,891
The knife punctured an artery.
You move, it could tear.

309
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:07,935
What are you, a doctor now? I can move.

310
00:21:08,477 --> 00:21:11,229
You stand up, you'll bleed out in a
matter of minutes.

311
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:31,291
Ta-da!

312
00:21:33,377 --> 00:21:34,419
Who's that?

313
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:35,712
This is Mr. Leonard.

314
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:38,882
You were talking in your sleep last night
about Galavan killing your mother.

315
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:40,842
I was?

316
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:42,219
Yes.

317
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:46,515
Mr. Leonard works for Galavan.

318
00:21:46,848 --> 00:21:48,517
Before he was arrested, of course.

319
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:49,893
Arrested?

320
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:54,231
Detective Gordon arrested Galavan
for kidnapping Mayor James.

321
00:21:54,398 --> 00:21:56,566
He's in Blackgate.

322
00:21:58,902 --> 00:21:59,987
Huh.

323
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:02,781
Oh. I thought you'd be pleased.

324
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:08,120
It doesn't matter anymore.

325
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:10,831
Why is he here?

326
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:13,542
He was a gift for you.

327
00:22:14,251 --> 00:22:17,254
And what exactly
am I supposed to do with a Leonard?

328
00:22:17,421 --> 00:22:18,964
Kill him.

329
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:22,843
I thought it might be nice to get some
retribution for your mother's death.

330
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:25,262
That it might cheer you up a little.

331
00:22:26,638 --> 00:22:27,639
No?

332
00:22:55,417 --> 00:22:56,418
I'm done.

333
00:22:58,628 --> 00:22:59,629
I need some rest.

334
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:03,008
And then I'm leaving Gotham forever.

335
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,810
I really thought he would like you.

336
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:16,688
What to do now?

337
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,761
<i>Please! Please!</i>

338
00:23:47,928 --> 00:23:49,429
<i>Not my ear!</i>

339
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:54,559
Why just smell the fear on your
victim, when you can taste it?

340
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:55,811
Right?

341
00:24:02,234 --> 00:24:05,487
Help me! Help! Help!

342
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:09,866
<i>Hola.</i>

343
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:12,953
<i>Hola,</i> Eduardo. Long time.

344
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:14,246
Yes.

345
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:17,958
Just a moment, please.

346
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,835
Help! Help!

347
00:24:25,006 --> 00:24:26,091
Are you on a job?

348
00:24:26,591 --> 00:24:28,885
It's not a job if you love what you do.

349
00:24:29,094 --> 00:24:30,470
<i>Oh. Fair enough.</i>

350
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:34,224
Listen, I'm in a bit of a pinch over here.

351
00:24:34,391 --> 00:24:36,393
I thought my membership was revoked.

352
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:39,688
<i>Bygones, darling. Live and let live.</i>

353
00:24:39,855 --> 00:24:42,524
So you eat people. Who am I to judge?

354
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:48,155
The target is a Detective Gordon.
I'll make it worth your while.

355
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:50,282
Send me the address.

356
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:05,505
Death squads
have softer touches than you!

357
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:13,972
At least Galavan goes top-shelf.

358
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,310
The EMTs should be on their way.

359
00:25:18,768 --> 00:25:19,769
Yeah, sure.

360
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:22,439
They'll be here
about the same time as our backup.

361
00:25:27,819 --> 00:25:30,280
So, you wanna tell me
what the hell's going on with you?

362
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:36,077
In the church that day,

363
00:25:36,953 --> 00:25:39,372
Barbara accused me of having
a monster inside me.

364
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,791
And?

365
00:25:42,459 --> 00:25:43,585
Lee seems to agree.

366
00:25:43,752 --> 00:25:45,670
She thinks I'm ready and willing
to give in to it.

367
00:25:45,837 --> 00:25:46,880
What do you think?

368
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,424
There was a moment

369
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:53,220
when I had the shotgun on Barbara.

370
00:25:53,678 --> 00:25:55,805
<i>She was taunting me to pull the trigger.</i>

371
00:25:56,806 --> 00:25:58,475
If Galavan's people hadn't busted in,

372
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:05,148
I don't know.

373
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:08,735
- But they did bust in.
- I nearly crossed the line.

374
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,153
The line?

375
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:14,824
Let me tell you something about the line.

376
00:26:15,992 --> 00:26:18,912
My third tour,
we were stationed in the desert.

377
00:26:19,621 --> 00:26:22,707
We captured three insurgents,
when this sandstorm kicks up.

378
00:26:23,792 --> 00:26:25,126
Zero visibility.

379
00:26:25,961 --> 00:26:28,004
Then we start taking fire,
we're getting lit up.

380
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:32,592
Suddenly, I'm alone.
I come across one of our prisoners.

381
00:26:33,134 --> 00:26:36,054
He's a kid. His hands are zip-tied,

382
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:38,056
but he figures "what the hell,"

383
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:40,976
he's gonna use the sandstorm
to try to escape.

384
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:42,143
So I jump him.

385
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:46,898
And I take my gun
and I jam it in his mouth.

386
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:53,405
I figured it was just a threat.
Show him who's boss, you know?

387
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:56,574
Next thing I know,

388
00:26:58,535 --> 00:26:59,828
I just pulled the trigger.

389
00:27:03,206 --> 00:27:04,249
Blew his head off.

390
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:18,722
That kid woke me up every night for years.

391
00:27:20,765 --> 00:27:22,267
Until I made my peace with him.

392
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:27,897
So yeah,
I come to find out I'm just a man,

393
00:27:30,066 --> 00:27:34,321
and at the right moment,
a man might do anything.

394
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,782
Any man.

395
00:27:40,035 --> 00:27:41,328
There is no line.

396
00:27:42,662 --> 00:27:44,080
There's just the law.

397
00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:46,666
That's what separates us
from the animals.

398
00:27:48,626 --> 00:27:49,794
There is no line.

399
00:27:58,636 --> 00:27:59,637
Alfred?

400
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:07,729
I thought about what you said,
and you're right.

401
00:28:09,272 --> 00:28:11,274
Pursuing Galavan on my own is too risky.

402
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:13,443
Well, you don't say.

403
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:15,945
Best course of action is to call
Detective Gordon in the morning.

404
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:17,447
<i>Enlist his help.</i>

405
00:28:17,614 --> 00:28:19,866
At last, some sense.

406
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:23,787
You're thinking of retiring, are you, sir?

407
00:28:24,579 --> 00:28:26,373
Yeah. Yeah. I'm very tired.

408
00:28:26,664 --> 00:28:28,666
Right, can I get you anything to
eat before you go to bed?

409
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:31,711
No. No, thank you, Alfred.

410
00:28:31,878 --> 00:28:32,962
Right, well sleep well.

411
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:34,506
Oh. And, uh, Master Bruce,

412
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:37,008
I sent that car off that's
parked at the end of the lane.

413
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:38,259
You know, the taxi?

414
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,428
<i>Don't worry, I gave him a right good tip.</i>

415
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:43,890
I mean, after all, he did drive
all the way up here, didn't he?

416
00:28:45,892 --> 00:28:47,018
I didn't call a taxi.

417
00:28:47,185 --> 00:28:52,148
You really are the most terrible liar,
aren't you, Master Bruce?

418
00:28:57,987 --> 00:29:00,031
I will not stop pursuing this, Alfred.

419
00:29:00,198 --> 00:29:01,533
<i>I'm never going to give up.</i>

420
00:29:01,866 --> 00:29:03,076
And nor will I.

421
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:06,996
Good night, sir.

422
00:29:24,222 --> 00:29:28,101
<i>Nothing will warm me more</i>

423
00:29:28,268 --> 00:29:32,230
<i>Than my, my mother's love</i>

424
00:29:34,732 --> 00:29:39,696
<i>I light another candle</i>

425
00:29:39,863 --> 00:29:43,867
<i>Dry the tears from my face</i>

426
00:29:44,033 --> 00:29:45,243
Why are you playing this song?

427
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:51,499
<i>I can bring tears to your eyes
and resurrect the dead.</i>

428
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:55,211
I form in an instant and last a lifetime.

429
00:29:56,171 --> 00:29:57,255
What am I?

430
00:29:57,547 --> 00:29:59,215
A memory. So what?

431
00:30:01,092 --> 00:30:02,886
You were humming this under your covers.

432
00:30:03,595 --> 00:30:05,388
I figure it has meaning for you.

433
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:16,232
Every night when I was young,
my mother would sing that song to me

434
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,485
when I was going to bed.

435
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:22,238
And every time, she would tell me...

436
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:25,783
"Oswald,

437
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:32,165
"don't listen to the other children.

438
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:37,462
"You're handsome and clever

439
00:30:39,881 --> 00:30:41,799
"and some day you will be a great man."

440
00:30:44,802 --> 00:30:46,513
She said that every time.

441
00:30:51,184 --> 00:30:52,685
That's all I have left now.

442
00:30:53,144 --> 00:30:54,270
Memories.

443
00:30:55,855 --> 00:30:57,440
And they're like daggers in my heart.

444
00:30:58,149 --> 00:30:59,275
Not forever.

445
00:31:03,446 --> 00:31:05,281
These were Ms. Kringle's.

446
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:08,952
It's all I have left to remember her by.

447
00:31:09,619 --> 00:31:11,621
But when I look at these,
I don't feel sadness anymore.

448
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:15,333
I feel gratitude. And do you know why?

449
00:31:15,542 --> 00:31:17,877
No. And I don't care.

450
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:20,421
This little visit is over.

451
00:31:23,132 --> 00:31:25,552
I will just simply bid you <i>adieu.</i>

452
00:31:28,263 --> 00:31:29,639
Mr. Penguin.

453
00:31:32,225 --> 00:31:34,852
For some men,
love is a source of strength.

454
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:37,897
But for you and I, it will always be
our most crippling weakness.

455
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:39,774
Move aside, Ed.

456
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:42,277
We are better off unencumbered.

457
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:47,949
- What did you say?
- You said it yourself.

458
00:31:49,242 --> 00:31:53,913
Your mother is dead
because of your weakness.

459
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:57,667
But what you need to realize
is that your weakness

460
00:31:58,668 --> 00:31:59,919
was her.

461
00:32:02,672 --> 00:32:04,549
My mother was a saint!

462
00:32:05,383 --> 00:32:09,345
The only person who truly cared about me.
And now she's gone.

463
00:32:10,054 --> 00:32:11,931
And I have nothing left!

464
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:13,891
A man with nothing that he loves

465
00:32:17,228 --> 00:32:18,896
is a man that cannot be bargained.

466
00:32:19,063 --> 00:32:22,150
A man that cannot be betrayed.

467
00:32:22,525 --> 00:32:26,654
A man who answers to no one but himself.

468
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:31,701
And that is the man that I see before me.

469
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:35,246
A free man.

470
00:33:00,647 --> 00:33:03,608
<i>Are the EMTs with you?
Captain Barnes needs immediate attention.</i>

471
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:05,026
Ambulance is still inbound.

472
00:33:05,193 --> 00:33:06,235
<i>We'll secure the perimeter.</i>

473
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:09,280
<i>Wait. Hold on! Behind you! No!</i>

474
00:33:09,489 --> 00:33:12,033
Officer? Officer?

475
00:33:16,746 --> 00:33:17,747
<i>Hola.</i>

476
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:20,083
<i>Detective Gordon, I presume?</i>

477
00:33:20,249 --> 00:33:22,710
- Who is this?
<i>- This is Eduardo Flamingo.</i>

478
00:33:23,586 --> 00:33:25,630
Is that name supposed
to mean something to me?

479
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,674
<i>Not yet. But it will.</i>

480
00:33:29,092 --> 00:33:30,718
<i>I'll be upstairs in a few minutes.</i>

481
00:33:31,344 --> 00:33:33,346
<i>I'm going to feast on your friends first.</i>

482
00:33:33,763 --> 00:33:35,348
<i>Save you for dessert.</i>

483
00:33:37,058 --> 00:33:39,852
<i>If you try to run, I will find you.</i>

484
00:33:41,479 --> 00:33:44,857
I won't. In fact, I'm coming down.

485
00:33:46,693 --> 00:33:48,111
What the hell is going on down there?

486
00:33:48,277 --> 00:33:49,445
We've got another hit man.

487
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:51,489
He's just taken out all of our backup.

488
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,491
I'm going down to end this.

489
00:33:53,741 --> 00:33:57,620
You wh-- He's just killed four cops!
You're not going anywhere on your own!

490
00:33:57,829 --> 00:33:59,372
He's right. I'm coming with you.

491
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:01,290
No. You're staying here.

492
00:34:01,457 --> 00:34:02,792
You need to make sure
he doesn't bleed out.

493
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,961
I just said
you're not going down there solo.

494
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:06,671
<i>We'll make them come to us.</i>

495
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:08,715
We stay here, we're sitting ducks.

496
00:34:10,258 --> 00:34:11,467
He's after me, boss.

497
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:17,140
Go.

498
00:36:46,289 --> 00:36:50,459
Oh, baby. You disappoint me.

499
00:36:51,627 --> 00:36:55,214
You have the right to remain silent.
I suggest you use it.

500
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,518
I'll make sure he gets processed
and put in lockup.

501
00:37:07,685 --> 00:37:08,728
Thanks.

502
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:12,440
Hey, Parks. You did good today.

503
00:37:27,538 --> 00:37:32,543
<i>For my mother looks over me</i>

504
00:37:32,710 --> 00:37:33,836
<i>And again!</i>

505
00:37:34,086 --> 00:37:39,425
<i>The fire has gone out
Wet snow from above</i>

506
00:37:39,634 --> 00:37:45,973
<i>And nothing will warm me more
Than my, my mother's love</i>

507
00:37:48,601 --> 00:37:50,895
What happened to that gentleman
you had tied up earlier?

508
00:37:52,188 --> 00:37:56,442
Galavan's lackey? Why do you ask?

509
00:38:07,912 --> 00:38:10,873
My mother always said a party's
not a party without entertainment.

510
00:38:46,951 --> 00:38:49,036
Sneaking out to see your girlfriend, huh?

511
00:38:50,121 --> 00:38:51,497
Selina, what are you doing here?

512
00:38:52,123 --> 00:38:54,250
Saving your ass from making a big mistake.

513
00:38:55,042 --> 00:38:57,545
Silver is bad news, Bruce.

514
00:38:57,878 --> 00:39:00,548
- You've said that before.
- This time, I have proof.

515
00:39:01,841 --> 00:39:02,842
You interested?

516
00:39:08,556 --> 00:39:11,267
You're going away for a long time,
Mr. Flamingo.

517
00:39:15,438 --> 00:39:16,522
Get up!

518
00:39:18,441 --> 00:39:20,192
I said, get up!

519
00:39:28,826 --> 00:39:29,910
<i>Let go!</i>

520
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:49,138
- Lee--
- Hold still.

521
00:39:49,472 --> 00:39:51,599
Thank you.

522
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:56,270
I almost crossed the line tonight.

523
00:39:56,687 --> 00:39:59,106
No kidding. How out of character.

524
00:40:00,149 --> 00:40:01,358
Scared me a little.

525
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:05,321
Welcome to my world.

526
00:40:09,366 --> 00:40:10,826
Why the hell are you with me?

527
00:40:12,912 --> 00:40:13,913
Beats me.

528
00:40:22,463 --> 00:40:26,342
Just tell me the truth. Always.

529
00:40:32,139 --> 00:40:33,182
I promise.

530
00:40:44,068 --> 00:40:45,069
Uh-uh.

531
00:40:47,863 --> 00:40:51,033
Detective James Gordon's phone.
This is Lee Thompkins speaking.

532
00:40:52,326 --> 00:40:53,369
Hi, Alvarez.

533
00:40:57,665 --> 00:40:58,666
I'll tell him.

534
00:41:03,087 --> 00:41:06,715
Eduardo Flamingo killed Officer Parks
before they could get him into lockup.

535
00:41:26,402 --> 00:41:27,486
Hit men?

536
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:33,492
You sent hit men after Jim Gordon?

537
00:41:33,784 --> 00:41:38,622
After I expressly told you to do
nothing until I gave you orders?

538
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:40,082
Nothing.

539
00:41:42,543 --> 00:41:44,461
Tell me this isn't about Barbara.

540
00:41:46,088 --> 00:41:47,840
He hurt her.

541
00:41:48,883 --> 00:41:51,594
I'm disappointed that you let a
woman like that get in your head.

542
00:41:51,802 --> 00:41:55,097
If you're feeling upset,
find yourself a nice librarian to torture.

543
00:41:55,264 --> 00:41:56,432
That always cheers you up.

544
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,684
Everything is ready.

545
00:42:00,186 --> 00:42:02,021
The brothers' arrival is imminent.

546
00:42:03,105 --> 00:42:04,273
Bruce Wayne will die,

547
00:42:04,523 --> 00:42:07,109
and his company
and this city will be mine.

548
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,444
Ours.

549
00:42:09,862 --> 00:42:16,368
Everything that we have worked for,
for so long, will be ours.

550
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:21,123
Endanger that prize again,
and though it breaks my heart,

551
00:42:21,707 --> 00:42:25,294
I will cut your throat.

552
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:43,020
Welcome, brothers. Welcome.

553
00:42:44,104 --> 00:42:47,024
Hey! Docks are closed.

554
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:50,694
I need to see some ID.

555
00:42:53,906 --> 00:42:55,157
Wait! No!

556
00:44:04,143 --> 00:44:05,144
English - SDH
