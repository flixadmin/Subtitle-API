This city still
needs saving.

Not by the hood.
It needs a hero.

If you survive a crucible,
you grow the stronger for it.

Slade's whole plan
was to take everything
from me. He did.

14
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,520
Slade took Laurel
because he wants
to kill the woman I love.

15
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,390
So?
So he took
the wrong woman.

00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,110
Oh, those pills I push?

161
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:37,380
Are known as vertigo.

162
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,450
In the wake
of the count,

163
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,620
I tinkered some
with his formula,

164
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:48,290
Introduced
an additive produced
by certain mushrooms.

165
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:51,520
My vertigo
reveals the face

166
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,590
Of your greatest fear.

167
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,600
[growls]

168
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,300
As I was saying...

169
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:07,370
Lack of leadership.
I nominate myself.

170
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,840
Any objections?

171
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:15,520
Our course of action
is straight as an arrow.

172
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,950
Gentlemen...

173
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,220
We're going
to kill him.

174
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:22,490
Hey, hey!
How was work?

175
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:26,290
"it" is not work.
It is a soul crushing
exercise in misery

176
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:28,490
That offers health and dental.
Suffice it to say,

177
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,360
I am highly motivated
to help convince the board
to sell you back the company.

178
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:34,800
Unfortunately, you don't
really have the qualifications
to run queen consolidated,

179
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,670
But what you do have
is passion.

180
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:40,240
You care about the company
and the people that work there.

181
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,970
That's what you have
to get across to them.

182
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,510
You got to speak
from the heart.

183
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:46,750
Felicity...

184
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,380
Would you like
to go out to
dinner with me?

185
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,850
I'm being serious here, Oliver.
So am I.

186
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:54,720
I don't want to read...
Too much into this,

187
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,620
But are you asking me
out on a date?

188
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:59,960
Like an actual date?
Like a...Date-date?

189
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,360
Su--I mean,
the implication
being with dinner

190
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,660
That you...
Usually I'm the one

191
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,830
Talking in sentence fragments.

192
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,470
[chuckles]

193
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:13,570
Would you like to go
to dinner with me?

194
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,480
Yes.

195
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,520
Oliver: Go.

196
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,150
Kelvin nico just knocked
over a liquor store.

197
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:26,320
Nico's in steelgrave's crew.

198
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,890
Send his photo to Roy.

199
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:30,060
Get me Felicity.
You got it.

200
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,190
Felicity: I can't
talk right now.

201
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,660
I'm at work.

202
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:38,000
Could I ask you guys
just to wait one moment?

203
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,700
Someone's calling
for tech support.

204
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,400
Oh, you are going to get me
so incredibly fired.

205
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,370
Okay, I am hacked into
the city's database.
I am running

206
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:49,040
Facial recognition...Now.
Oliver: Do you like Italian?

207
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,510
What?
For tonight.

208
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,510
You like Italian, right?
Everyone likes Italian.

209
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:54,550
Oliver, you're in the middle
of a high speed chase.

210
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,520
I'm multitasking.

211
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,050
I got him.
He's in the sewer.

212
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,920
I'm picking up his cell phone
underneath. He's at the corner

213
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,390
Of grand and ames.

214
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,660
And yes, I love Italian.

215
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,400
Detective Lance--
captain Lance--
is also in pursuit.

216
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,800
You are welcome.
I have to go.

217
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,220
The arrow:
Detective...Thank you.

218
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,950
You had it handled.
For what you said today.

219
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:35,050
I wish I could do more.

220
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:38,320
You've already done
more than enough.
I've got to go.

221
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:39,560
Some place
I have to be.

222
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,730
You got a hot date
or something?

223
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,100
Amanda: So this morning

224
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,800
Makes how many
escape attempts
in the last five months?

225
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,640
Nine.

226
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,640
What we have here
is a failure to reach
an understanding.

227
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,770
[exhales]
go to hell.

228
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,640
So this is my reward
from saving you from drowning

229
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,780
In that freighter
off the coast of Lian Yu?

230
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,210
Yeah.

231
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,350
Why'd you do that?

232
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:04,420
That's need
to know.

233
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:09,090
Suffice it to say,
I have need of a man
of your capacity.

234
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:12,560
I don't care.

235
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,700
I don't care
about anything
except going home.

236
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,830
And you should know that.

237
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,170
You should know
that I will never stop

238
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:22,070
Trying to escape.

239
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:23,570
And you should know
that it's extremely
easy to kill someone

240
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,740
The world already
thinks is dead.

241
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,210
Kill me, then.

242
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,180
I don't care.

243
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,910
We're going
to have to try this
another way, then.

244
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:41,190
Hi. Thank you for waiting.

245
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,090
Ah, no problem.
I just want
to buy this.

246
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:46,830
This is a satellite frequency
communicator tx40.

247
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:49,700
Yeah,
I'm trying to breach
a torsecured firewall

248
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,200
And I need
something to help me

249
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,270
Piggyback off
a keyhole hexagon
satellite, so...

250
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:55,770
I did that once.

251
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:57,440
Hacked a public
wi-fi signal,

252
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,510
Piggybacked using
crowd-sourced
stealth processing.

253
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,770
Huh.

254
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,840
You're Felicity Smoak.

255
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,510
Formerly of queen
consolidated.

256
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:08,250
Do you mind if I
ask you something--
why are you here?

257
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,580
How do you know who I am?

258
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,380
I know a guy
who might be
interested

259
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,050
In hiring someone
with your expertise.

260
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,990
I'm not actually...Looking
for a new job right now.

261
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,420
God help me.

262
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,820
But I can help you buy this.

263
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,990
Unless I can't.
I mean, I shouldn't.

264
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,300
You shouldn't buy this.

265
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,830
Ok. Clearly
you don't understand

266
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,530
How this whole
sales thing works.

267
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,770
The next gen model,
the tx50, comes out
in a few months.

268
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,870
I got to touch
one last year.
Pure bliss.

269
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:32,000
And if you
want to breach
tor-level security,

270
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:34,140
You should really
deploy a remote
administration tool.

271
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,040
I have a good one.
Here's the url.

272
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,180
Thanks.

273
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,450
Happy hacking.

274
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,150
I certainly hope so.

275
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,290
False alarm.

276
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,120
Are you sure?
These contractions...

277
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,790
Just braxton-hicks. You're not
even four centimeters dilated.

278
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,990
I feel like an m1-a1.

279
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,660
It's a tank.
Think a big, big tank.

280
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,500
You did the right
thing coming in.

281
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,700
You don't want
your husband--

282
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,470
Boyfriend.
Ex-husband.

283
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:04,500
To be delivering
the baby on the side
of the freeway.

284
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,870
You can
get dressed now.

285
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,840
All right.
[exhales]

286
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,710
Are you ok?

287
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,180
Yeah, yeah, I'm not
the one that's nine
months pregnant.

288
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,380
You look a little scared.

289
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,380
Honey, please,
I've thrown down
with the taliban,

290
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:16,880
Malcolm merlyn,
and a host

291
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,980
Of mirakuru-powered
human weapons.

292
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,150
I'm terrified.

293
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,920
[both laugh]

294
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,450
Queen, party of two.

295
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:05,460
Hi.
Hi.

296
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,300
Hi. [chuckles]

297
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,340
[chuckles]

298
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,310
What?
Nothing.

299
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,940
I'm just--
nervous?

300
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,210
Yeah.

301
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,210
Line forms behind me.

302
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,310
Scotch. Neat.

303
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,820
Just the water
for me, thanks.

304
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,480
Are you--are you sure?

305
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,320
The booze might sort of
help with the whole--

306
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:29,520
The alcohol is not
going to mix well with
the three benzos I took.

307
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,260
Am I being crazy?
I mean, what do we have
to be nervous about?

308
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,330
Well, we've already
exhausted every topic

309
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,330
That one would
normally talk about
on a first date

310
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:41,670
And a second date
and a third date,

311
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,500
And every date,
actually,

312
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,510
And I've already
seen you shirtless.

313
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:49,110
Multiple times.

314
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,340
Shirtless,
all the time.

315
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,210
Thank you.
Thank you.

316
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:59,020
There are still a few things
that you don't know about me.

317
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,150
Please. Name one.

318
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,660
The five years that
I was away...

319
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:08,290
I wasn't always on Lian Yu.

320
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,060
I thought so.

321
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,300
Where were you?

322
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,700
Hong Kong...For one.

323
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:22,780
And I have been thinking
a lot recently about...

324
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,480
My time there.

325
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:31,080
The choices
that I had to make.

326
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:35,250
Those years sound
like they were full
of a whole lot of suck.

327
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,920
I'm sorry.

328
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,930
I'm just a little
out of my element.

329
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:47,400
The entire time
that I was gone,

330
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,970
I could never...

331
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:51,870
Completely trust someone.

332
00:16:53,210 --> 00:16:55,470
And when that
goes on for so long,

333
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,310
You stop...

334
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:00,080
Seeing people for people.

335
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,110
You see...

336
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,120
Threats.

337
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,850
Or targets.

338
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:13,130
And when I decided
to come home, I...

339
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:18,100
I just didn't know
how to turn that
part of me off.

340
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:25,600
Then I walked
into your office.

341
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:30,710
You were the first person
that I could see as a...

342
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:33,850
A person.

343
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:39,450
There was just
something about you.

344
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:41,490
Oh, yeah, I was
chewing on a pen.

345
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:42,720
It was red.

346
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,500
[beeping]

347
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,160
GPS shows him
in the restaurant.

348
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,970
The arrow's
definitely in there.

349
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,970
If we're going
to find him, we got
to get in close.

350
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,970
We're close enough.

351
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,310
Do you remember when I told you
that because of what we do,

352
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:01,540
I didn't think that

353
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,410
I could be with someone
that I...

354
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:07,750
That I could
really care about?

355
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,110
Yeah, I remember.

356
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,990
So maybe I was wrong.

357
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,220
[whistles]

358
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,060
Oliver, are you--

359
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,230
[grenade fires]
Ollie--

360
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,230
[explosion]

361
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,810
[patrons screaming and crying]

362
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,970
Is she ok?

363
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:06,370
She's just knocked out.

364
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:09,340
Saw it all over the news,
police and fire
are on the scene.

365
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,680
Yeah, I didn't think
it was the best idea

366
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,240
To stick around
and answer questions.

367
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:13,580
You don't think you
and an explosion

368
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,550
At the same place
is a coincidence?

369
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:18,850
Hey, check this out.
It's a GPS.

370
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:21,990
I found it
on your jacket.
It's wasted now.

371
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,790
You took out one
of steel graves' crew
earlier tonight.

372
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,360
It was a set up

373
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,160
So they could plant
that thing on me.

374
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,830
Oliver, I know
what you're thinking.

375
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,730
No, you don't.
Listen, I'm not other people.

376
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,700
I know exactly what's
going on in your head,
and you are wrong.

377
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,470
Diggle, somebody
put a tracer on me
and I don't notice?

378
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:37,840
The only explanation...

379
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,140
I lost my focus.

380
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,340
[dialing]

381
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,480
The arrow: Detective.
The person we took down earlier

382
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,710
Is working
with whoever's responsible
for tonight's explosion.

383
00:19:46,710 --> 00:19:49,350
Another one
of steel grave's
crew, I'm guessing.

384
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,920
Well, I need to know
who's at the top of
that organization now.

385
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,450
And where I can find him.

386
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,320
I'm on it.

387
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,830
[gasps]

388
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,830
Hey, hey, hey,
you're safe.

389
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:06,570
You're safe. I'm here.

390
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,240
[footsteps]

391
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,740
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
I'm on your side!

392
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,310
Got this handled, detective.

393
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,580
These guys
blew up a building.

394
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:19,340
You think
I'm sitting this out?

395
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:21,050
Suspect's name
is Werner Zytle.

396
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,720
He's a real head case.

397
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,080
Keep your head
on a swivel, then.

398
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:36,430
[footsteps]

399
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:38,330
I'm Werner Zytle.

400
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:39,570
Ahh!

401
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,940
You can call me vertigo.

402
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,570
The Count's dead!

403
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:48,010
Some things never die.
You, for example.

404
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,440
It's frustrating.

405
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,710
Just means I have to try
a little bit harder.

406
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,210
[both grunting]

407
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,910
Ahh!

408
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:02,520
The count might
be dead, true...

409
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:06,560
But his glorious
narcotic lives on--

410
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,460
With a few enhancements

411
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:13,270
That will reveal to you
your greatest fear.

412
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:16,170
Like gazing
upon truth itself.

413
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:22,310
[both grunting]

414
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,500
[gunshot]

415
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,500
Get away from him
or get put down!

416
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,370
[groans]

417
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:54,640
No...No!

418
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,520
[beep]

419
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,620
[voice disguised]
Felicity, call an ambuLance!

420
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,200
Are you ok?

421
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,530
That was a pretty
strong psychotropic
Werner hit you with.

422
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:22,230
[clears throat] how's
detective Lance's condition?

423
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,700
Stable. He's at
starling general.

424
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:26,040
I hacked
the paramedic radio.

425
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,940
He had a coronary
artery spasm

426
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:30,510
Treatable with
medication.
He'll be fine.

427
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,410
How are you?

428
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:36,180
Believe it or not,
I have had worse
first dates.

429
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,680
Hit the streets.

430
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,190
Werner's agenda
can't stop with me.

431
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:42,250
I need to know
what he has planned.
On it.

432
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,520
I'll back
him up.

433
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,260
Roy's got it.
Go home to Lyla.

434
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,860
Oliver...

435
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:51,100
If this is about
what happened, man,

436
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,360
Risk is part
of the job.

437
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:54,700
Diggle. It's just
intel gathering.

438
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,440
Roy can handle it.

439
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:04,240
I know we need to talk.

440
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,850
About our dinner
or our dinner
getting blown up?

441
00:23:06,850 --> 00:23:08,810
Both.
It's ok.

442
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,350
We'll talk about it
after we catch this guy.

443
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:14,320
But maybe we should
reschedule the board meeting.

444
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,690
It's in less
than an hour.

445
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:19,460
I've got this.

446
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:27,330
[speaking Japanese]

447
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:31,140
[groans]

448
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,270
When are people
going to realize that
I don't speak Chinese?

449
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,670
Japanese.

450
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,940
You speak English?

451
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,450
Better than
you speak Chinese.

452
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:43,520
Where am I?

453
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,320
Our home.

454
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,150
Mine and my
husband's.

455
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:50,490
Your husband?

456
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,260
Welcome to my home.

457
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:59,300
Dinner?

458
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,470
[sighs]

459
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,470
[monitor beeping]

460
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:06,840
I got to warn you,
the doctors told me
not to get yelled at.

461
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,870
Well, it's a good thing
you don't care about

462
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,280
Your doctor's
instructions, then,

463
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,950
Since you're still
going out in the field.

464
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:16,010
Do you know what an advanced
healthcare directive is?

465
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:19,890
It's what they ask for
when you're going
to die, dad.

466
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:23,590
The night Sara left,

467
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,890
The night
you collapsed,

468
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:29,390
The e.R.
Doctor asked me
if you had one.

469
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,360
[sighs]

470
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,730
I'm sorry, Laurel,
I really am.

471
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,370
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

472
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:41,070
Then why do you keep
pushing yourself
like this?

473
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:44,810
I don't know how.

474
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:49,550
I've been a cop since
before you and your sister
were born. It's all I know.

475
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:52,550
If I'm not a cop...

476
00:24:52,550 --> 00:24:55,290
What am I?

477
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:00,530
You're my father.

478
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:03,860
And I need you.

479
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:06,100
And I just spoke
to ned foster.

480
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,030
He said the board is primed.

481
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,630
You just have to go
in there and wow them.

482
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:12,340
Which I am pretty sure
is a business term.

483
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,010
I'm afraid we have a situation.

484
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:16,310
Apparently there's another
bidder for the company.

485
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,980
Really? Who?

486
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,380
Ray palmer.

487
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:23,520
Nice to meet you.
Love your company.

488
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,980
Nice to see you again,
miss Smoak.

489
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,820
You two know
each other?

490
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:30,420
So sorry I am late.
Heh, traffic was terrible.

491
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,660
Which is why I took
my helicopter.

492
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,790
I parked on your roof.
I hope that's ok.

493
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,630
You guys validate, right?

494
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:40,270
Oh, frack.

495
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,470
Two years ago,
the people of starling city

496
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,370
Thought I was dead.

497
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:46,770
I came back.

498
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:49,470
And so can
queen consolidated.

499
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,110
With starling national
bank's new investment,

500
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:55,980
We can take qc
out of receivership
and into the future.

501
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:00,090
I mean,
this company's my family.

502
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:06,060
And as my mother
always said...

503
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:09,590
There is nothing
more important
to me than family.

504
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,930
Thank you.

505
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:19,940
[inhales,
exhales]

506
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,270
That was
a good speech.

507
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,040
Hard to top.

508
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,940
[exhales]

509
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:27,650
Thank you all
for coming out today.

510
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:31,120
I promise to be brief,
if not a little
entertaining.

511
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:36,620
Ahh. Oh, that's one
of my new smart watches.

512
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,860
I'm very proud of those.

513
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,130
You like it,
it works for you?

514
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:45,360
Yeah, good. Anyway.
Science. Numbers.

515
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,200
These numbers show
qc's performance

516
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,070
Under mr. Queen's
management.

517
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:55,240
I'm using that term
extremely, b-t-w.

518
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,910
Also b-t-w,
these numbers

519
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,740
Aren't sanitized
for wall street.

520
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,950
This is raw
information

521
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,410
From your company's
own servers.

522
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,380
How did he get into
our computers?

523
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,680
Something tells me
he deployed a remote
administration tool.

524
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,620
But the truth is,

525
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,960
This company's woes
are a symptom of
a much larger problem.

526
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,330
And that problem
is starling city.

527
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:16,660
Queen consolidated
can't hope to survive

528
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:19,800
If the city
it's located in is dying.

529
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,200
Guess what? It is.

530
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,870
Nobody wants
to live here anymore.

531
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:27,540
[chuckles] and after
two terrorist attacks,

532
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,240
Who can blame them?

533
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,680
This city
still needs saving.

534
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,680
And that is my vision
for this company.

535
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,180
To not only see it
rise from the ashes,

536
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:41,890
But to take this city with it
to that new horizon.

537
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:44,760
And that new day has a name.

538
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:49,460
[applause]

539
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:54,200
Oliver!

540
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,800
I'm sorry.

541
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,040
I really thought
it was going
to go our way.

542
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,970
So did I. But maybe
the company's better off
with dr. Palmer.

543
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,010
I couldn't make time
for qc last year,

544
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:04,980
And trying to get
the company back now,
it's selfish.

545
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,080
That's something
that the old me
would have done.

546
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,310
And if the past 12 hours
have reminded me of anything,

547
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,080
It's that two years ago,
I made the decision
to put Oliver queen aside

548
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:15,390
And be the arrow.
It's not a choice
I get to unmake.

549
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:16,820
Last night
at the restaurant,
you didn't feel that way.

550
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,190
Look what happened,
Felicity.

551
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:20,730
Oliver! The explosion
wasn't your fault.

552
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:22,860
When Werner hit me
with the vertigo dart,

553
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,900
He told me
that his formula,

554
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,100
It shows us
our worst fear.

555
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,700
And I saw myself.

556
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:34,040
You don't really think
you're afraid of
yourself, do you?

557
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,640
I think I'm scared
of what would happen

558
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,710
If I let myself
be Oliver queen.

559
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,490
What did we find out?

560
00:28:47,490 --> 00:28:48,790
You know how we've got
the number of crime bosses

561
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,360
In starling city
down to three?

562
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,460
Well, this new guy, Werner,
he wants to make it zero.

563
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,260
Diggle: Take out
the competition.

564
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:57,600
Mikhail petrov,
luciano costa,
shintawa shimosawa.

565
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,830
What are their
locations?

566
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:02,570
I'm not getting anything
off of last known addresses.

567
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:04,540
Werner could be
moving these guys
right now.

568
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,140
I'm going as fast as I can!
It's not like these guys

569
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,640
Walk around with little GPS
attached to them.

570
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,180
Unless they do.

571
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,840
Petrov, costa, shimosawa,

572
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,180
They're all on parole
or out on bail.

573
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:15,880
Ankle monitors.

574
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,380
Can't be right.
They're all in
the same location.

575
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:22,590
Rockets arena.
The heavyweight
title fight's tonight.

576
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,920
That's like Christmas
for crime bosses.

577
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,660
There'll be like
20,000 people there.

578
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,060
He was willing
to blow up a restaurant
to take down one man.

579
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,730
He'll blow up a stadium
to take down three.

580
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:30,230
Yeah, but an RPG won't do it.
I need you looking

581
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:32,060
For a large explosive device.

582
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,900
Roy...Suit up.

583
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,300
Where do you
want me?

584
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,670
Here.

585
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:42,170
I can't have you
in the field anymore.

586
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,880
Really?
What changed?

587
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,340
You're going to be a father.

588
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:47,880
[chuckles] Oliver,
you've known for

589
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,650
The past five months
I was going to be
a father.

590
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,350
So I ask you again--

591
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:53,320
What changed?
I have.

592
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,990
My risks can't be your risks.

593
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:58,690
That...Diggle,
you have a life.

594
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:01,060
You have a new life, it's...

595
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,960
Life I can't have.

596
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,800
I get it.

597
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,030
You and Felicity
were in an explosion.

598
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,930
People died, either one
of you could have.

599
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,840
But you didn't.

600
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,740
You can't let that
shake you, man.

601
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,170
Detective Lance is laying
in hospital bed right now

602
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:16,170
Because I let him--
wait, wait, wait!

603
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,780
Lance is his own man who
makes his own decisions,

604
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,910
And so am I.

605
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:21,580
Not this one.

606
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,380
Oliver, I've given
the last two years

607
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,220
Of my life
to your crusade.

608
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,090
I don't know what
that's supposed
to earn me,

609
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:29,250
But it earns me
at least the right
to make my own choices.

610
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,290
No, it doesn't--
damn it, Oliver,

611
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:31,590
You would be dead

612
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:34,590
Ten times over
if it wasn't for me!

613
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:38,100
You're right.

614
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,270
But this is my crusade,

615
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:44,000
Which makes this my decision.

616
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:55,350
[crowd cheering]

617
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,730
[whistling]

618
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,180
Five minute timer.

619
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,220
Come on!
What are you
waiting for?

620
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,150
[grunting and groaning]

621
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:39,690
My partner.
[beep]

622
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:41,090
Go.

623
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:42,290
Felicity: I've isolated
a frequency spike

624
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,300
Consistent with
an incendiary device.

625
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,700
It's in the maintenance tunnel
underneath the stands.

626
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,040
I'll get the bomb.

627
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,300
Get the son
of a bitch.

628
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,950
Back for more?

629
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:14,430
It's as if you've
developed an addiction

630
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,590
To vertigo.

631
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,070
[distorted voices]

632
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:36,210
I've made my choice.

633
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,550
[both grunting]

634
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,730
Felicity,
we're running
out of time here.

635
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:54,570
Ok. From your description,

636
00:32:54,570 --> 00:32:56,030
It sounds like
a collapsible
circuit design.

637
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,770
Roy: Felicity...

638
00:32:57,770 --> 00:32:59,070
Cut the yellow wire.

639
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:02,810
There is no
yellow wire.

640
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:05,480
Ok, new plan.

641
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,380
Look above you,
there should be
insulated piping

642
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:10,350
Pumping the arena's ac system.
They're pumping freon.

643
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,820
You want to break one off,
aim it at the bomb.

644
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,790
You're going
to freeze the thing.

645
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,290
[both grunting]

646
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:45,780
Roy: It's not working!

00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:02,130
[grunting]

648
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:12,840
Don't look so surprised.

649
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:15,610
I haven't been gone that long.

650
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,590
Lock me down,
it doesn't matter.

651
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:23,620
There will always
be a vertigo,

652
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:26,320
Always someone to
pick up the mantle.

653
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:29,590
You have given it
the power.

654
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,560
Don't you see?

655
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,070
Don't you see?

656
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,570
You look well.
How's Nanda Parbat?

657
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,270
Hot.

658
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,580
It's good
to see you.

659
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,580
You've been missed.

660
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,410
I was on my way
to see Laurel,

661
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,420
Picked up
your radio chatter.

662
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,650
You should tell
Felicity mix up her
frequencies a bit.

663
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:56,590
That's a good tip.
And is this permanent,
you being back?

664
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:59,220
I hope so.

665
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,560
We'll see.

666
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,890
How are you doing?

667
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:06,200
I'm...Working
through a few things.

668
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,600
Word of advice?

669
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,940
We're not our masks.

670
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:16,010
And we need people in our
lives who don't wear one.

671
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:22,510
Hey.

672
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,350
What are you
doing here?

673
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:26,320
And the answer
better not be
stalking me.

674
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,820
Well, that depends
on whether you consider

675
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:30,660
Pinging your phone's GPS
stalking. Ok, guilty.

676
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:33,830
But you know how I know a guy
who would be interested

677
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:35,590
In hiring someone
with your expertise?

678
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,960
Yeah, turns out
I could really use it.

679
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,260
Seems somebody hacked
my cell phone and my laptop

680
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:42,670
And my desktop.
Gee, that's too bad.

681
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:46,500
All my data's been
replaced by audio files
of porcupine flatulence.

682
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:49,470
And so I was hoping
that whoever did it

683
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,080
Might be willing
to undo it

684
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,880
If I apologized
for misleading them
in any way.

685
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,410
That would probably work.

686
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,050
Oh, unless, of course,
you did all that

687
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:58,920
To steal that person's
friend's company,

688
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,890
In which case I would suggest
getting used to the sound

689
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,990
Of spiky rodents farting.

690
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:04,720
I didn't steal anything!

691
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,890
Ok, maybe a little,
but as it turns out,

692
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:08,590
I didn't even need the data.
I mean, you saw the speech.

693
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,960
It was a pretty good speech.

694
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,400
My friends
just had a baby,

695
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,930
So if you don't mind,
there's another slimy little
human that needs my attention.

696
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:16,630
Oh, and b-t-w,

697
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,770
Might want to check
your tablet while
you're at it.

Hey.
Hi.

00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:29,080
Oh, she is scrumptious!

704
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,920
I can come back.

00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,720
No, Oliver, come in.

706
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,700
Oh, she's perfect.

707
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,400
Congratulations.

708
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:51,300
Thank you, Oliver.

709
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,470
For what?

710
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,210
For being right.

[inhales, exhales]

712
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:02,110
The second I looked at her...

713
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:05,050
Everything changed.

714
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:07,420
The whole universe...

715
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,350
Changed.

716
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:14,330
You were right.

717
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,150
How do I get
out of here?

718
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:37,750
You can't leave.

719
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:40,650
[scoffs] well,
why don't you
try to stop me?

720
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:42,520
You've already learned I can.

721
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,920
Repeatedly.

722
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,890
Amanda waller wants you
working for her,

723
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,730
And she will have her way.

724
00:37:49,730 --> 00:37:51,460
Yeah, well,
too bad for her.
I'd rather die.

725
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:53,830
Which is why it's not
your life she's threatening.

I am to be responsible for you.

to motivate me.

She's threatened my family.

She'll kill them
if I let you go.

731

My father had a proverb
he was once fond of.

732
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:14,420
A man cannot live
by two names.

733
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,090
And what does that mean?

734
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:18,390
In your case...

735
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:21,390
I believe it means
not having any choice.

Ahh. They look
really happy.

to talk.

unprecedented.
