1
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,515
Marshmallows remind me
of going camping with my daddy.

2
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,676
I could eat them all night long.

3
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,477
Of course he did make me cough them
back up again for breakfast.

4
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,112
This one time,
I coughed up an entire Dalmatian.

5
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:43,869
That ain't nothing.
I coughed up a whole tribe of pygmies.

6
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,711
They started looking at me weird.

7
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,957
I remember them.
They was quite friendly.

8
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,436
I found a human spinal column
in my fecal matter once.

9
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,874
You might want to get that looked at.

10
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,997
Pass the beans, Beans.

11
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,712
- Sheriff?
- No, thanks.

12
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,038
Mr Rango? Can you tell us
about the Spirit of the West?

13
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:11,798
- Yeah, tell us about that.
- Is it true what they say?

14
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,390
Yes, the Spirit of the West!

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,795
The eternally unattainable ideal.

16
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,708
They say he rides in
an alabaster carriage

17
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,319
with golden guardians to protect him.

18
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:26,193
But he only appears to those
who have undertaken an epic quest!

19
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,279
And have made it

20
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,517
to the other side.

21
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,829
The other side of what?

22
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,799
It's a metaphor.

23
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,875
My eye!

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,433
That's gonna heal right up.

25
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,348
Sheriff? What are you going to do
about Rattlesnake Jake?

26
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,875
What? Where?

27
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,354
Sorry about that. Word is
you come against him once or twice.

28
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,628
Yeah.

29
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,637
Jake. You mean my brother.

30
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,512
- Your brother?
- That's what I said!

31
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,754
But he's a snake and you're a lizard.

32
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,509
Well, Momma had an active social life.

33
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,955
Did he ever bite you?

34
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,311
Sure enough did. Look at that baby.
Go ahead, you can touch it.

35
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,149
That's interesting.
That there's a belly button.

36
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,753
Luckily, I'm immune to his venom.

37
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,677
Put some in my coffee
just to give it a little tang.

38
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,631
Is it true he's only scared
of them hawks?

39
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,196
Them's what we call
his natural predator.

40
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,912
All this talk of that serpentine devil
is putting my quills on edge!

41
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,917
I ain't sleeping tonight. No, sir.

42
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,032
Don't you all worry about a thing.
Come tomorrow, we'll locate that water

43
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,037
and return to a hero's welcome.

44
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,549
Friends, before we bunk down

45
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,989
I'd like us all to join hands
for a moment,

46
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,714
say a few words
to the Spirit of the West.

47
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,353
That's a good idea.

48
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,273
Ain't always spoken rightly to you,
Spirit of the West.

49
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,038
But tonight I want to thank you for
bringing Sheriff Rango into our lives.

50
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,598
It's a hard life we got.

51
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,473
Sometimes I don't know how
we're gonna make it.

52
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,236
But somehow, Sheriff Rango
makes me think we will.

53
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,959
We needed a brave man
and you sent us one.

54
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,958
Nice to have someone
to believe in again.

55
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,516
Thank you, Spirit of the West. Amen.

56
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,232
- Amen.
- Amen.

57
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,518
Just checking.

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,594
- It's a little cold tonight.
- Thank you.

59
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,753
You ever feel like those things
are looking at you?

60
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,512
That's a Spanish dagger.

61
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,313
But around here,
we just call them the Walking Cactus.

62
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,429
Walking?

63
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,235
There's an old legend they actually
walk across the desert to find water.

64
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,955
When I was a little girl, I'd stay up late
watching them, to see if they'd move.

65
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,959
I thought if I could follow them,
they'd lead me to someplace wonderful.

66
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,550
Someplace with enough water
for everyone.

67
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,752
Night after night, I watched them.
I never saw them move.

68
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,675
But you're still watching.

69
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,674
Who doesn't want to find
someplace wonderful?

70
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,273
We'll find the water, Beans.
I promise you.

71
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,830
That's such a lonely sound.

72
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,557
You ever get lonely?

73
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,954
Sometimes.

74
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,392
I can't imagine it. You're such a charmer
and everyone likes you so much.

75
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,753
- I never made friends easy like that.
- No?

76
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,875
No, we're pretty isolated
out there on the ranch,

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,560
sort of like being sealed up
in a little box.

78
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,911
Don't really see a lot of folks.

79
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,156
I wouldn't know what that's like.

80
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,394
There someone special
in your life, Rango?

81
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,713
There used to be.
But she couldn't keep her head.

82
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,751
Besides, my life's too dangerous
for that kind of thing.

83
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,792
You know, it's an awful solitary
existence out there on the prairie.

84
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,036
Riding the ranges and the suchlike.

85
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,869
Beans?

86
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,674
Beans?

87
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,035
I'm gonna skin you alive, boy! I'm gonna
whup you like a red-headed stepchild!

88
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,388
Choleric varmints, ain't they?

89
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,318
Dysfunctional family. Need intervention.

90
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,759
What's that coming?

91
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,113
It's the water.

92
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,795
I have a plan, and each and every one
of you has a part to play.

93
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,069
What do I do?

94
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,872
Spoons, you got
the most important job of all.

95
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,111
You stay up here on the ridge,
and if anything goes wrong,

96
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,953
you give the signal.

97
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,711
Hey, Beans.
What size dress you wearing?

98
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,354
- He got it!
- Hallelujah!

99
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,038
- He found the water!
- You did it, son.

100
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,115
Well, actually...

101
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,959
Why can't you be all brainy
like your brother?

102
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,355
Pappy, about that water.
There's something I gots to tell you.

103
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,198
Hush up, now. Somebody's coming.

104
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,791
Good sirs, gracious good afternoon
to thee and thee and thee.

105
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,990
May I present Madame Lupone's

106
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,429
Terpsichorean Troupe
of Travelling Thespians!

107
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,236
- What is that?
- I think they's thespians.

108
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,318
Thespians?
That's illegal in seven states!

109
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:55,069
The stage is set. The princess
prepares to take her own life.

110
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,394
I yearn for love.

111
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,632
Meanwhile, the lone sentry
stands watch at the castle gate.

112
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,557
Stands watch at the castle gate...

113
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,351
Hark! Who goes there?

114
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,152
This plot is highly predictable.

115
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,554
Quiet! This is my favourite part.

116
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,159
Arriving to great fanfare
'twas her aged father,

117
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,312
strucketh by Cupid.

118
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,558
Prithee, unhand my fair daughter

119
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,238
and reach for the...

120
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,234
- Line?
- "Reach for the sky!"

121
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,239
What was that?

122
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,237
Must be that immersive theatre.

123
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,509
We got you surrounded!

124
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,315
You and your entire family get
your hands up where I can see them.

125
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,749
My entire family?

126
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,279
<i>Grits and spit and collard greens</i>

127
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:53,632
<i>Waffle chitlins, monkey brains</i>

128
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,355
<i>Refried bones and booger blood</i>

129
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,677
<i>Pickled eggs and flaps of mud</i>

130
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,991
It's a full house.

131
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,237
Looks like we're gonna have ourselves
a good old-fashioned standoff.

132
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,908
I'll have you know, you're not looking
at our entire contingent.

133
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,589
What's that supposed to be?

134
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,039
That's the signal.

135
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,596
That's the signal!
Something must have gone wrong!

136
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,068
So something's supposed to happen?

137
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,476
I am open to suggestions.

138
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,559
Run!

139
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,635
Get on the wagon!

140
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,074
Should we have ourselves
some sport, chill'ens?

141
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,877
I likes it when they run.

142
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,833
Maybelle, give the holler!

143
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,428
Looks like we made it!

144
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,959
That audience was quite responsive.

145
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,753
Yeah, well, I think that
chromosome pool is about dried up.

146
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,239
We got bats!

147
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,832
Here! You drive.

148
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,835
Looks like there's gonna be
soup tonight!

149
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,271
Come on, let's get some!

150
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,352
What in tarnation?
Don't shoot the water!

151
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:18,796
Jedidiah! It's time for
the Alabama squeeze box!

152
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,273
Okay, Pa!

153
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,797
I am sensing hostility.

154
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,035
Incoming!

155
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,789
Hello!

156
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,035
Goodbye!

157
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,710
Lasso that swine!

158
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,032
I suggest we take evasive action!

159
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,991
I suggest you shut up and shoot!

160
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,554
- What happened to the Sheriff?
- He had a previous engagement!

161
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,194
Boseefus, give them some gumbo now!

162
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,154
What was that? Go check it out!

163
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,032
What is it? Is there a problem?

164
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,719
You could call it that.

165
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,229
Headache.

166
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,831
Is that all you got?

167
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,156
That wasn't altogether unpleasant!

168
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,675
Eat lead!

169
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,433
Here, hold these.

170
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,478
Get your hands off me!

171
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,713
Oh, I'm sorry.

172
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,235
Jump!

173
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,673
It's impossible.

174
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,913
It can't be. It's empty.

175
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,632
There's no water!

176
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,036
No water?
Then what the hell we been fighting for?

177
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,199
Sir, you have defiled and desecrated
the very sustenance of our livelihood!

178
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,788
I think that there fella in the purty dress
is the Sheriff.

179
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,354
That's the same fellow what give us
a prospecting permit?

180
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,199
- A what?
- Irrelevant! Obfuscation.

181
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,197
You and your kin are under arrest
for bank robbery

182
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,231
and the murder
of our beloved financial advisor

183
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,670
Johannes Merrimack the Third,
AKA, Fluffy Joe.

184
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,279
Sheriff, we didn't kill nobody.

185
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,630
We done tunnelled into that vault,
but there weren't nothing in it.

186
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,591
Somebody done robbed that bank
before we robbed it.

187
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,358
Then where'd you get this here jug?

188
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,357
That's what I been trying
to tell you, Pappy.

189
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,595
I found it in the desert.

190
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,792
Then why in tarnation
did you bring it here?

191
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,674
Hold on! You're saying this here jug
was empty when you found it?

192
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,949
That's right.

193
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,308
I don't believe a word of it.

194
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,873
- Let's hang them, Sheriff!
- String them up!

195
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,353
Who'd dump water in the desert?

196
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,439
Wouldn't be the first time.

197
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,599
It's a puzzle!
It's like a big old mammogram!

198
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,472
What's going on, Sheriff?

199
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,874
I don't know.

200
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,834
But I'm going to strip away this mystery
and expose its private parts.

201
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,076
You and your kin are coming with me.

202
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,589
They're coming!

203
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,312
Here they come!

204
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,869
Looks like they got them robbers.

205
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,839
Where's the water?

206
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,631
There weren't no water.

207
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,832
Where is he going?

208
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,229
He's going to see the Mayor.

209
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,197
He's got to be pleased with that.

210
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,992
That's a good one, boss!

211
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,475
That's interesting.

212
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,319
I do apologise for the shoes, Mr Rango,

213
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,591
but there's a certain protocol
to this game, you understand.

214
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,915
I'm a bit of a stickler for protocol.

215
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,838
Well, that's good, 'cause you got
a few questions to answer

216
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,110
and I've got my own protocol.

217
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,753
But why would anyone dump water
in the blooming desert?

218
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,714
It does seem a bit naïve, taking the word
of admitted bank robbers.

219
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,276
Besides, once they hang,
your job is done.

220
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,799
- Bravo!
- Job well done.

221
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,718
But what if somebody did rob the bank
before they got there?

222
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,876
And who would do that, Mr Rango?

223
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,116
I was hoping you could tell me.

224
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,073
That sounds marginally
near to an accusation.

225
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,077
Take it any way you like.

226
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:00,676
Something you said keeps rattling
around in my frontal lobe.

227
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,869
What's that?

228
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,075
"Control the water
and you control everything."

229
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,676
Come now, Mr Rango.

230
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,553
You attribute divine power to me.

231
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:14,672
How on earth
could I possibly control the water?

232
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,078
You've obviously mastered this game.

233
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,476
Well, I've been playing it
for many years, sir.

234
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,592
I was here before the highway split
this great valley.

235
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,234
I watched the march of progress,

236
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,715
and I learned a thing or two.

237
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,232
Perhaps it's time you started
to take the long view,

238
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,989
begin to appreciate
the broad sweep of history.

239
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,079
Look out there, son.

240
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,270
You can almost see time passing.

241
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,391
What are you building out here?

242
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,671
The future, Mr Rango, the future.

243
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:56,315
One day soon,
all this is going to fade into myth,

244
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:59,113
the frontier town, the lawman,
the gunslinger.

245
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,515
There's just no place
for them any more.

246
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,757
- We're civilised now.
- That's right, civilised.

247
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,113
That's what the future holds.

248
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:10,437
You can either be part of it,
or you can be left behind.

249
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,515
Is that what happened to
Mr Merrimack? Did he get left behind?

250
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,077
Careful, Mr Rango. You seem to forget
you're just one little lizard.

251
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,075
You seem to forget
I'm the law around these parts.

252
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,592
Our new sheriff has been
playing the hero for so long,

253
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,995
he's actually starting to believe it.

254
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,429
Call in Rattlesnake Jake.

255
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,074
But Jake's the Grim Reaper.

256
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,430
He never leaves
without taking a blooming soul.

257
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,709
Do it!

258
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,679
Now be still. You gotta look
presentable to meet your maker.

259
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,471
<i>Death has arrived</i>

260
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,952
<i>How will the hero survive?</i>

261
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,592
The Mayor has bought up
all the land in the valley,

262
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,472
except for your ranch, Miss Beans.

263
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,229
That just don't make no sense.
Without water, that land is useless.

264
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,033
Unless he controls the water.

265
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,912
Like a monkey's bladder!

266
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,190
Then he could bring it back
once he's bought up all the land.

267
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,355
But how does he control the water?

268
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,592
Well, you gotta spend some time
and train them.

269
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,632
'Cause you know monkeys, when
they do go, you rub their nose in it.

270
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,757
Sheriff, we got a problem.

271
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,397
Hold on, Beans.
That won't be necessary.

272
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,917
- Hang him till his head turns blue!
- Give us them robbers!

273
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,349
Hold on! Calm down, everyone!
Let me talk!

274
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,630
- Nail them to the courthouse!
- Now, calm down, everybody.

275
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,274
Get them out here
so we can cut off their giblets!

276
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,393
You, too, Spoons?

277
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,717
They done taken that water.
They taken everything we got!

278
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,673
No one's stringing anyone up.
Not while I'm sheriff.

279
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,949
But this is all his fault!

280
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,310
You said you's gonna
bring the water back.

281
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,829
It's just, we got no hope
without that water.

282
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,757
We got nothing left to believe in.

283
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,873
You see that sign up there?

284
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,710
As long as that sign says "Sheriff,"

285
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,070
you can believe that there's
law and order in this town.

286
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,079
But without law and order,
ruminate on that. Oh, yeah.

287
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,237
Starts out slow, like a fungus.

288
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,874
Somebody says a cross word.
Accusations start flying.

289
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,673
Neighbour turns on neighbour.
Pretty soon, we're eating our children!

290
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,119
And then dogs and cats
are getting together

291
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,754
to create all sorts of unnatural
mutant aberrations!

292
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,150
So, you want something
to believe in, Spoons?

293
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,749
Believe in me.

294
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,197
Believe in that there sign.

295
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:03,476
For as long as it hangs there,
we got hope.

296
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,189
Hello, brother.

297
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,232
Thirsty?

298
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,878
Long time, brother.
How you been keeping?

299
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,958
Well, you know...

300
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,433
I hear you been telling about how
you killed all them Jenkins brothers.

301
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:58,074
With one bullet, wasn't it?

302
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,997
Isn't that right?

303
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,159
All these good folks here
believe your little stories, don't they?

304
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,909
Why, they believe you're just
a stone killer, don't they?

305
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,077
Seems these folks trust you.

306
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,152
They think you're gonna save
their little town.

307
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,590
They think you're gonna save
their little souls!

308
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,836
But we know better, don't we?

309
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,670
So why don't you show your friends here
what you're made of?

310
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,473
Show them who you really are.

311
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,478
Why don't you just pull your gun
and shoot me?

312
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,353
But, of course, you won't need all these.

313
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,311
Just one, right?

314
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,796
Go ahead, hero. Pull the trigger.

315
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,030
You got killer in your eyes, son?

316
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,349
I don't see it.

317
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,597
You didn't do any of them things
you said, did you?

318
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,554
You didn't kill them Jenkins brothers.
You ain't even from the West!

319
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,749
Are you?

320
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:13,034
- Say it!
- No.

321
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:17,073
Speak up.
I don't think your friends here heard you.

322
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,629
No.

323
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,149
All you've done is lie
to these good people.

324
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,273
You ain't nothing but a fake
and a coward. Isn't that right?

325
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,669
Yes.

326
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,432
- Louder!
- Yes.

327
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,752
Listen close, you pathetic fraud.

328
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,758
This is my town now.

329
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:44,078
If I ever see you again, I will take
your soul straight down to hell!

330
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,873
Who are you?

331
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,153
<i>Who am I?</i>

332
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,878
<i>I'm nobody.</i>

333
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,277
Golden guardians.

334
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,713
The alabaster carriage.

335
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,869
The Spirit of the West.

336
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,875
Excuse me? Mister Spirit, sir?

337
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:16,115
There's a beaut. Sometimes you got to
dig deep to find what you're looking for.

338
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,039
So you made it.

339
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,149
Is this heaven?

340
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,875
If it were, we'd be eating Pop-Tarts
with Kim Novak.

341
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,275
Yeah.

342
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,472
No kidding.
What are you doing out here?

343
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,797
Searching, same as you.

344
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,871
I don't even know
what I'm looking for any more.

345
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,797
I don't even know who I am.

346
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,749
They used to call you
the Man with No Name.

347
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,789
These days they got a name
for just about everything.

348
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:49,993
Doesn't matter what they call you.
It's the deeds make the man.

349
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:53,715
Yeah, but my deeds just made things
worse. I'm a fraud. I'm a phoney!

350
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,549
My friends believed in me,
but they need some kind of hero.

351
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,272
Then be a hero.

352
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:03,109
No. No, no, you don't understand.
I'm not even supposed to be here.

353
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:07,233
That's right. You came a long way
to find something that isn't out here.

354
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,880
Don't you see? It's not about you.

355
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,313
It's about them.

356
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,519
But I can't go back.

357
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,870
Don't know that you got a choice, son.

358
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,239
No man can walk out on his own story.

359
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,838
So you made it.

360
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,875
That's right, <i>amigo.</i>
The other side of the road.

361
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,430
Did you just see that?

362
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,559
We each see what we need to see.

363
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,437
Beautiful, isn't it?

364
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,035
Yeah.

365
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,434
It is.

366
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,635
Come, my friend.
I want to show you something.

367
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:22,634
Many years ago, this entire
valley was covered in <i>agua.</i>

368
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:26,514
Now only one question remains.

369
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,153
Where did it go?

370
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,716
They follow the water.

371
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,798
They follow the water! Come on!

372
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:45,637
<i>That just don't make no sense.</i>
<i>Without water, that land is useless.</i>

373
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,231
What are you building out here?

374
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,157
The future, Mr Rango.

375
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:54,592
<i>You can either be part of it,</i>
<i>or you can be left behind.</i>

376
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,679
<i>I was here before the highway split</i>
<i>this great valley.</i>

377
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,108
<i>I watched the march of progress</i>

378
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,390
<i>and I learned a thing or two.</i>

379
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,556
Control the water

380
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,955
and you control everything.

381
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,676
<i>Come now, Mr Rango.</i>

382
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,518
<i>You attribute divine power to me.</i>

383
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,074
<i>How on earth</i>
<i>could I possibly control the water?</i>

384
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,397
What now, <i>amigo?</i>

385
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,638
No man can walk out on his own story.

386
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,513
I'm going back.

387
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,234
But why?

388
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,237
Because that's who I am.

389
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:42,357
You got a lot of nerve showing up here,
lawman. What is it you want?

390
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,870
Your pappy and them boys are about
to hang for something they didn't do.

391
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,838
But I've got a plan.

392
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,513
I appreciate how difficult
this is for you, Beans.

393
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:22,478
But you're making a practical decision.

394
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,194
Decisions, decisions.

395
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,312
There's no need for any more suffering.

396
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,910
Your family's ranch is nothing
but a wasteland now.

397
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,996
Sign the deed and relieve yourself
of your father's burden.

398
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,673
My daddy was not a burden!

399
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,075
Keep your blood money
and I'll keep my land!

400
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,992
Do what he says or,
by all the fires of the black pit,

401
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,351
I'll squeeze them pretty brown eyes
out of your skull!

402
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,190
Now, hold on, Jake.
There's no need to...

403
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,515
Let me do my job! You brought me in.

404
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,074
Now we're gonna play this thing
out to the end!

405
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,189
Sign the damn paper, woman!

406
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,118
Go to hell!

407
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,555
Where do you think I come from?

408
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,355
Look into my eyes.

409
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,710
I want to see you die.

410
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:28,789
Jake!

411
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,917
I'm calling you out!

412
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,519
Jake!

413
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:42,078
This day
just got a little more interesting.

414
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,355
Put her down.

415
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,916
Or what, little man?
You going to kill me?

416
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,792
That's just about the size of it.

417
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,908
- Get your filthy paws off me!
- Shut your gob!

418
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,032
All right, Sheriff, make your move.

419
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,959
Now, <i>amigos!</i>

420
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,874
- Heave! Heave!
- Heave! Heave!

421
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,394
That was a bad idea.

422
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,555
Thirsty, brother?

423
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,071
Here it comes!

424
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,795
No. No!

425
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,189
It's a miracle!

426
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,679
Look out!

427
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,112
- Lookee there!
- What is that?

428
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,319
It's our salvation, Pa!

429
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,398
It's a jailbreak, boys! We're busting out!

430
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,119
I'm gonna blow so many holes in you,
your guts'll be leaking lead!

431
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,834
Well, then
it's a good thing I brought some backup.

432
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,669
What?

433
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,072
Ain't no hawk.

434
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,509
Ain't nothing but bats!

435
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,679
Stick to the plan, boys!
Let's bleed that devil dry!

436
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,671
It only takes one bullet.

437
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,831
You ain't got the nerve.

438
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,353
Try me.

439
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,073
Oh, Mr Rango.

440
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,352
Aren't you forgetting something?

441
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,271
Hand me your gun, Sheriff.

442
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,752
Now, Mr Rango.

443
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,590
Beans! Hold on.
Don't worry, I got a plan.

444
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,551
Help!

445
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,875
Open the door!

446
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,919
Okay, plan B.

447
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,115
Beans, you're mumbling.

448
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,639
All my problems taken care of
except for one.

449
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,355
It's a new West, Jake.

450
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:47,632
There's no room for gunslingers
any more. We're businessmen now.

451
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,398
Yeah, we got new hats.

452
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,956
Where I come from,
we call this improvisation.

453
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,958
You came back.

454
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:04,995
What was that?

455
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,554
No need to panic,
but I think you just swallowed plan B.

456
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,755
What?

457
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,753
Okay, panic time.

458
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,633
You and the Sheriff are more alike
than you think.

459
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,518
You're nothing but legends.

460
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,189
Pretty soon,
no one will believe you even existed.

461
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,788
One last bullet to kill one last outlaw.

462
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,672
How fitting.

463
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,636
Sheriff, I'm sure if we work together,

464
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:08,719
we can reach a mutually beneficial
solution to our current situation.

465
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:10,956
You better take it up with him.

466
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,438
One bullet.

467
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,035
I tip my hat to you,

468
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,919
one legend to another.

469
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,790
What was that you said?

470
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,391
"Pretty soon,
no one will believe you even existed."

471
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,591
No, Jake! No!

472
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,754
Rango!

473
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:58,789
You brought the water back,
just like you promised.

474
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,478
You really are a hero.

475
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,752
Well, the thing about heroes is,
whenever you...

476
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,552
Don't spoil it.

477
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,829
Right.

478
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:10,749
Well, I don't know about you all,
but I could sure go for a dip.

479
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,713
And so the lizard completes his journey

480
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:21,674
from humble beginnings
to the legend we sing of today.

481
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:26,271
And although he is certain to die,
perhaps from a household accident,

482
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,278
which account
for 65% of all unnatural deaths,

483
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,676
the people of the village
will honour his memory

484
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:35,832
even as they abandon their dignity.

485
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,390
- I'm going in.
- How about a cold one, there?

486
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,431
Water ain't money. Money is money.

487
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,516
Well, I ain't got no...

488
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:51,829
We have a problem.

489
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,474
Who let Snuggles in the pool again?

490
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,909
I really think you complete me.

491
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,110
Prithee, unhand my fair maiden.

492
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:02,198
- Cut. Cut. Everybody, take five.
- How can they take this any more?

493
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,479
Oh, you kids.

494
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,352
What did you do that for?

495
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,789
I was just checking.
I hope you don't get too sunburned.

496
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,036
You can peel a man's face right off.

497
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,513
- What is it?
- That there's some human spleen.

498
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:15,595
Don't touch it.

499
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:16,914
That's the second time
that's happened to me.

500
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,519
This water thing's great.

501
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,039
I'm urinating right now.

502
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:23,118
<i>Adult swim, next five minutes.</i>

503
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,470
<i>Stay between the buoys.</i>

504
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,828
I packed your lunch. Danish is in there

505
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,552
and I picked the raisins out
just the way you like it.

506
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,591
Don't forget, your nasal spray is
in your saddle-bag...

507
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,233
- Beans!
...and your moisturising lotion...

508
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,476
- Now, Beans! We've talked about this.
- Lotion?

509
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:37,194
That's for my gun. That's gun lotion.

510
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,833
Sherriff, where are you headed?

511
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:41,713
There's trouble down a dry creek.
Bad Bill's been acting up again.

512
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,592
Now, honey, you come back
with all your digits.

513
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:44,994
And don't go trying to be a hero.

514
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:46,473
Beans, you are missing the point.

515
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,795
I got an image to protect now.

516
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,313
Where's my Tic Tacs?

517
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,437
- I found them.
- What's going on?

518
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,234
You know, in order to satisfy the needs
of the collective,

519
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,032
the hero must abandon the self

520
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:02,954
and solidify his image as an icon
that will forever be remembered.

521
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,149
So, this is the sunset shot.

522
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:16,589
Give them a good one, <i>amigo.</i>

523
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,878
Ready, Excelsior?

524
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,917
My fellow comrades.

525
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,508
There will be times
when you doubt yourself.

526
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:34,837
When you feel pummelled
by the cataclysms of life,

527
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,748
remember this moment.
Remember me.

528
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,793
Know that I will be there watching you,

529
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,758
sometimes at inappropriate moments.

530
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,230
That's part of the deal.

531
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:50,830
And remember, within all of us resides

532
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:53,394
the true Spirit of the...

533
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,235
Let's take it from the top.
