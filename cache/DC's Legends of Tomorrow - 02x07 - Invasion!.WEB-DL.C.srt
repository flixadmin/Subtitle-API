1
00:00:01,031 --> 00:00:02,662
Previously on "The Flash,"

2
00:00:02,687 --> 00:00:04,498
"Arrow," and "Legends of Tomorrow"...

3
00:00:05,796 --> 00:00:07,210
Since we learned of them,

4
00:00:07,235 --> 00:00:08,864
we've been calling them the Dominators.

5
00:00:08,866 --> 00:00:10,032
You can't do this alone.

6
00:00:10,034 --> 00:00:11,133
I don't plan to.

7
00:00:11,135 --> 00:00:12,701
Guys, thanks for coming.

8
00:00:12,703 --> 00:00:15,204
This is Kara Danvers. Supergirl.

9
00:00:17,841 --> 00:00:19,908
I went back in time to
change the timeline.

10
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,001
It's called Flashpoint,

11
00:00:21,026 --> 00:00:22,811
and now things here are different

12
00:00:22,813 --> 00:00:24,413
than before I left.

13
00:00:24,415 --> 00:00:26,915
You just erased a daughter from my life?

14
00:00:26,917 --> 00:00:29,218
He took it upon himself
to change the timeline,

15
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,186
and, because of it,
my brother was killed.

16
00:00:31,188 --> 00:00:33,255
There's no amount of feeling bad

17
00:00:33,257 --> 00:00:34,823
that could ever make up for that.

18
00:00:34,825 --> 00:00:37,092
I'm having memories of a stranger,

19
00:00:37,094 --> 00:00:39,695
but she's not really a stranger.

20
00:00:39,697 --> 00:00:42,364
What if, when you interacted
with your younger self in 1987,

21
00:00:42,366 --> 00:00:44,833
- you...
- Inadvertently changed my past.

22
00:00:44,835 --> 00:00:46,435
You're back!

23
00:00:46,437 --> 00:00:48,103
Oh, it's so good to see you.

24
00:00:48,105 --> 00:00:49,638
I love you, Dad.

25
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,729
Call Lyla.

26
00:00:50,754 --> 00:00:53,175
Tell her these Dominators
aren't here peacefully.

27
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:58,180
Maybe they chose us because
we couldn't fight back,

28
00:00:58,182 --> 00:01:00,107
because none of you are meta-humans.

29
00:01:00,132 --> 00:01:01,516
What is their plan?

30
00:01:03,887 --> 00:01:05,754
The phrase loosely translates to,

31
00:01:05,756 --> 00:01:08,390
"We are nearing completion
of the weapon."

32
00:01:11,895 --> 00:01:15,163
I can't believe that you guys
escaped an alien spaceship.

33
00:01:15,165 --> 00:01:16,765
Key words: alien spaceship.

34
00:01:16,767 --> 00:01:18,300
- I have questions.
- They can wait.

35
00:01:18,302 --> 00:01:19,868
Thanks for helping me get my sister home.

36
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:20,836
Yeah, man.

37
00:01:20,838 --> 00:01:22,537
What's our status?

38
00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:24,606
Nothing, since the Dominators
paid their little visit

39
00:01:24,608 --> 00:01:27,042
- to mess with our heads.
- Why would they do that?

40
00:01:27,044 --> 00:01:28,710
What if they were trying
to pit us against each other,

41
00:01:28,712 --> 00:01:30,412
in order to gain intel about meta-humans?

42
00:01:30,414 --> 00:01:31,446
Man, I wish they would just send us

43
00:01:31,448 --> 00:01:32,646
an IM with a questionnaire.

44
00:01:32,671 --> 00:01:34,850
Well, metas pose the biggest
threat to their invasion.

45
00:01:34,852 --> 00:01:36,551
It would make sense they'd want
to get to know their enemies.

46
00:01:36,553 --> 00:01:37,719
By kidnapping people.

47
00:01:37,721 --> 00:01:39,121
Perhaps they were searching your minds

48
00:01:39,123 --> 00:01:40,989
for potential meta-human vulnerabilities.

49
00:01:40,991 --> 00:01:43,358
I think it's time we return the favor.

50
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,027
What do you want to do?
Kidnap one of them now?

51
00:01:45,029 --> 00:01:46,762
Ever since we fought off that one ship,

52
00:01:46,764 --> 00:01:48,330
they've kind of been in short supply.

53
00:01:48,332 --> 00:01:51,533
Actually, I know where to find one.

54
00:01:51,535 --> 00:01:53,635
I've been reviewing old Army footage

55
00:01:53,637 --> 00:01:56,872
of their first encounters
with the Dominators,

56
00:01:56,874 --> 00:01:59,174
and I think I pegged the fight to...

57
00:02:02,012 --> 00:02:04,780
Redmond, Oregon. 1951.

58
00:02:18,529 --> 00:02:20,529
You're suggesting we travel to 1951,

59
00:02:20,531 --> 00:02:22,264
abduct a Dominator, and interrogate it

60
00:02:22,266 --> 00:02:24,499
to determine their intentions.

61
00:02:24,501 --> 00:02:27,803
They kidnapped us. Seems fair.

62
00:02:27,805 --> 00:02:31,306
Whoa. Time travel. I'm definitely in.

63
00:02:31,308 --> 00:02:32,427
Okay, hold on, though.

64
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:34,162
Professor Stein and Caitlin
have been talking about

65
00:02:34,186 --> 00:02:35,467
a way to take down the Dominators.

66
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:36,919
They could probably use your help.

67
00:02:36,944 --> 00:02:38,680
Pass.

68
00:02:38,682 --> 00:02:40,215
Yeah, I mean, I'm with him, mostly 'cause

69
00:02:40,217 --> 00:02:41,750
I just don't want to lose my geek cred,

70
00:02:41,752 --> 00:02:43,418
but time travel!

71
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,121
I could take Amaya and Mick.

72
00:02:46,123 --> 00:02:47,422
Do it.

73
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,725
- Yeah!
- Okay.

74
00:02:49,727 --> 00:02:51,521
And, uh, the new president called,

75
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:54,196
which would be cool under
different circumstances,

76
00:02:54,198 --> 00:02:55,664
but she wants to meet with us.

77
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,399
Let's bring Ray and Sara as backup.

78
00:02:57,401 --> 00:02:58,900
What about me? I can do backup.

79
00:02:58,902 --> 00:03:01,103
Can I talk to you for a second?

80
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:04,906
I don't know.

81
00:03:08,645 --> 00:03:10,846
I would like to minimize
your involvement in this.

82
00:03:10,848 --> 00:03:13,014
Why? Because I'm an alien?

83
00:03:13,016 --> 00:03:14,783
I also happen to be your biggest weapon.

84
00:03:14,785 --> 00:03:17,285
You are an unknown quantity,
and this is not personal.

85
00:03:17,287 --> 00:03:19,121
Except that's exactly how this feels.

86
00:03:19,146 --> 00:03:21,022
Kara, when I started living this life,

87
00:03:21,024 --> 00:03:22,257
it was just me.

88
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:23,859
I was going up against human threats...

89
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:25,227
That I could handle.

90
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:27,162
Then it was meta-humans,
and I can handle that.

91
00:03:27,164 --> 00:03:28,997
Now I learn that there
are multiple Earths,

92
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:31,299
and I was brainwashed aboard
an alien spacecraft...

93
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:33,535
I am sure that was
unnerving, but I don't...

94
00:03:33,537 --> 00:03:36,638
I don't get unnerved.

95
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,640
But when I go up against something new,

96
00:03:38,642 --> 00:03:40,976
I push back.

97
00:03:40,978 --> 00:03:43,011
Right or wrong, it is who I am,

98
00:03:43,013 --> 00:03:44,646
and it is what I do,

99
00:03:44,648 --> 00:03:46,648
so I'm asking for a little bit of space

100
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,285
because I have to draw
the line somewhere.

101
00:03:50,287 --> 00:03:54,156
I need to claw back a sense of normalcy.

102
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:56,191
Please stay here.

103

104
00:04:11,308 --> 00:04:13,141
This ship is everything!

105
00:04:13,143 --> 00:04:14,843
What type of propulsion
system does it use?

106
00:04:14,845 --> 00:04:16,063
- No idea.
- Oh, my God.

107
00:04:16,088 --> 00:04:17,439
That construct on the bow
looks like it could be

108
00:04:17,463 --> 00:04:19,080
- some sort of time sphere.
- Yeah, no idea.

109
00:04:19,082 --> 00:04:20,033
To operate a ship of this size,

110
00:04:20,057 --> 00:04:21,683
the deep-link nets would have to be...

111
00:04:21,685 --> 00:04:22,759
Oh, my God, you'd have to use,

112
00:04:22,783 --> 00:04:24,455
- like, a quantum neural chipset...
- Hey, guys, guys.

113
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,121
Amaya and Rory are waiting
for us on the bridge.

114
00:04:26,123 --> 00:04:28,490
Can we just keep moving this along?

115
00:04:28,492 --> 00:04:30,125
- This ship is...
- Automatic?

116
00:04:30,127 --> 00:04:31,827
- Supersonic.
- Hypnotic.

117
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:34,196
Funky fresh.

118
00:04:38,068 --> 00:04:39,338
Professor?

119
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:41,503
It's highly unlikely
we can fashion a weapon

120
00:04:41,505 --> 00:04:43,538
with sufficient force to
overcome the Dominators.

121
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:45,207
I was thinking the exact same thing,

122
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:46,508
which is why I invited...

123
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,377
So what if, instead,
we try to attack them

124
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:51,246
with something infinitesimally small?

125
00:04:51,248 --> 00:04:53,081
I'm... I'm sure you're familiar
with the story of the lion

126
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,683
with the thorn in his paw.

127
00:04:54,685 --> 00:04:58,753
You used to love telling me
that story when I was a kid.

128
00:04:58,755 --> 00:05:01,189
Oh. Hello.

129
00:05:01,191 --> 00:05:03,692
The lion with the thorn
in his paw is a parable,

130
00:05:03,694 --> 00:05:06,361
a story about a big, ferocious creature

131
00:05:06,363 --> 00:05:08,864
that is felled by something small.

132
00:05:08,866 --> 00:05:10,932
So what do you need help with?

133
00:05:10,934 --> 00:05:13,101
Uh, I'm afraid it's... it's classified.

134
00:05:13,103 --> 00:05:15,370
Oh, juicy.

135
00:05:15,372 --> 00:05:19,174
Some sort of secret government
space weapon, no doubt.

136
00:05:19,176 --> 00:05:21,009
Something like that,
only this sort of work

137
00:05:21,011 --> 00:05:23,445
is slightly out of my wheelhouse.

138
00:05:23,447 --> 00:05:26,781
Yeah, if only you knew someone
with a PhD in nanotechnology.

139
00:05:26,783 --> 00:05:28,750
Uh-huh, unfortunately,

140
00:05:28,752 --> 00:05:31,119
Raymond's busy working on other things.

141
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:34,356
I was talking about me.

142
00:05:34,358 --> 00:05:37,959
Did the six years I spent at
MIT magically slip your mind?

143
00:05:40,864 --> 00:05:42,898
Of course not.

144
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,201
Good. Okay. Let's get to work.

145
00:05:46,203 --> 00:05:48,603
Hmm.

146
00:05:56,947 --> 00:06:00,916
We made it. This is the '50s. Sick.

147
00:06:02,222 --> 00:06:05,487
Severe time jumps can cause nausea,
temporary deafness...

148
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:09,190
Linguistic disorientation.

149
00:06:10,861 --> 00:06:13,028
You. Clean it up.

150
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,296
We're gonna kidnap an alien.

151
00:06:14,298 --> 00:06:15,630
Okay.

152
00:06:15,632 --> 00:06:17,999
I know I did not just travel through time

153
00:06:18,001 --> 00:06:19,601
so we could stay on the ship.

154
00:06:19,603 --> 00:06:21,937
Ponytail, you're staying on the ship.

155
00:06:23,574 --> 00:06:26,675
I'll take that as,
"Have fun storming the castle".

156
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,143
Oh, for real?

157
00:06:28,145 --> 00:06:30,045
You're gonna use "Princess
Bride" against me?

158
00:06:30,047 --> 00:06:32,280
Against me?

159
00:06:32,282 --> 00:06:34,683
Okay. I got you, girl.

160
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,021
Celebrating July 4th early?

161
00:06:40,023 --> 00:06:41,556
Ray made it for me.

162
00:06:41,558 --> 00:06:43,692
You look like a star-spangled idiot.

163
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,026
We need to find the Army.

164
00:06:53,403 --> 00:06:54,869
I think we found 'em.

165
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,080
What are we waiting for?

166
00:07:07,082 --> 00:07:09,449
Let's grab an alien and get out of here.

167
00:07:09,451 --> 00:07:13,319
Just waiting for one of
the weaker ones in the herd.

168
00:07:18,493 --> 00:07:21,194
I don't think there are any weak ones.

169
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:25,298
Do you have any idea
what's going on out there?

170
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,201
It's a real-life Spielberg movie,

171
00:07:28,203 --> 00:07:30,803
and we're stuck in here.

172
00:07:30,805 --> 00:07:32,605
Okay.

173
00:07:32,872 --> 00:07:35,072
I think I know what's
really bothering you.

174
00:07:35,074 --> 00:07:36,707
I'm having the worst case of FOMO

175
00:07:36,709 --> 00:07:39,076
while everyone else is out
there kidnapping an alien?

176
00:07:39,078 --> 00:07:40,311
No.

177
00:07:40,313 --> 00:07:42,747
I think you escaped 2016

178
00:07:42,749 --> 00:07:45,149
to get away from Barry.

179
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,150
Mm-mm. Excuse me.

180
00:07:46,152 --> 00:07:47,418
I escaped 2016

181
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,120
so that I could come see the Waverider

182
00:07:49,122 --> 00:07:51,422
and so that I could time travel.

183
00:07:51,424 --> 00:07:53,424
And?

184
00:07:53,426 --> 00:07:56,083
And also, yes,

185
00:07:56,108 --> 00:07:57,622
I wanted to get away from Barry.

186
00:07:57,647 --> 00:08:00,052
Ah! You realize that's insane, right?

187
00:08:00,077 --> 00:08:01,490
You're holding a grudge
against your best friend

188
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:03,147
when the world is
potentially going to end.

189
00:08:03,171 --> 00:08:04,240
I'm sorry. My "best friend"?

190
00:08:04,264 --> 00:08:05,770
He only killed my brother.

191
00:08:05,772 --> 00:08:07,438
- He didn't kill...
- Okay, you're right.

192
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,873
He didn't literally kill my brother.

193
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,608
What I mean to say is,
he was responsible.

194
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:13,010
Okay? He just needed to save his family,

195
00:08:13,012 --> 00:08:15,413
and in doing that,
he ended up destroying mine.

196
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:27,758
You know, all this time traveling,

197
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,160
fighting aliens, this is the stuff

198
00:08:29,162 --> 00:08:31,395
I used to dream about as a kid.

199
00:08:31,397 --> 00:08:33,197
Heh. Yeah, me too.

200
00:08:34,367 --> 00:08:37,034
But it doesn't feel like a dream.

201
00:08:37,036 --> 00:08:39,837
It just feels weird.

202
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,375
Well, exactly, and it's
only gonna get weirder.

203
00:08:44,377 --> 00:08:47,945
So that's why we have to be
able to rely on our friends.

204
00:08:49,148 --> 00:08:52,450
I really wish I could
right now, Felicity.

205
00:08:52,452 --> 00:08:56,220
But he's not my friend.

206
00:09:10,103 --> 00:09:12,470
- They're taking off.
- I don't get it.

207
00:09:12,472 --> 00:09:15,005
Why are the Dominators attacking us,
then just leaving?

208
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:18,042
It's an RIF mission.
"Reconnaissance in force."

209
00:09:18,044 --> 00:09:20,010
Ah, look.

210
00:09:20,012 --> 00:09:22,446
A straggler.

211
00:09:24,217 --> 00:09:27,251
We need him alive, Mick.

212
00:09:27,253 --> 00:09:29,887
I'm just gonna rough him up a little.

213
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,328
Hey!

214
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,696
Whoa!

215
00:09:40,266 --> 00:09:43,067
Aah! Squeal, you pig!

216
00:09:55,214 --> 00:09:56,881
Hey, Dad?

217
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,383
Dad.

218
00:09:59,385 --> 00:10:00,851
What? Oh, I'm sorry.

219
00:10:00,853 --> 00:10:03,220
Can you hand me those induction clamps?

220
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:06,290
Yes.

221
00:10:08,795 --> 00:10:10,461
You know, this reminds me of that time

222
00:10:10,463 --> 00:10:11,829
we stayed up all night

223
00:10:11,831 --> 00:10:14,265
building my seventh grade science project.

224
00:10:14,267 --> 00:10:16,100
Remember how mad Mom
got when she found out

225
00:10:16,102 --> 00:10:18,302
you let me drink coffee to stay awake?

226
00:10:18,304 --> 00:10:20,671
No.

227
00:10:20,673 --> 00:10:23,574
I mean, no, no, I should never...

228
00:10:23,576 --> 00:10:26,410
never have let you do that.

229
00:10:26,412 --> 00:10:28,646
Uh, I'm sorry. Will you excuse me?

230
00:10:28,648 --> 00:10:30,381
Are you okay, Dad?

231
00:10:30,383 --> 00:10:34,752
I'm just preoccupied with
my work, that's all.

232
00:10:41,427 --> 00:10:42,993
You know, you're really taking

233
00:10:42,995 --> 00:10:45,396
this whole absent-minded
professor thing to a new level.

234
00:10:45,398 --> 00:10:47,765
- I don't know what you mean.
- Your daughter.

235
00:10:47,767 --> 00:10:49,433
Ever since you've come back,

236
00:10:49,435 --> 00:10:51,402
you've treated her like a total stranger.

237
00:10:51,404 --> 00:10:55,606
That's because she is a total stranger.

238
00:10:55,608 --> 00:10:59,543
I'm sorry. It's just that,
when I last left 2016,

239
00:10:59,545 --> 00:11:04,181
that young woman did not exist.

240
00:11:04,183 --> 00:11:07,685
Wait, you're saying Lily
belongs to another timeline?

241
00:11:07,687 --> 00:11:09,553
That, when Barry created Flashpoint, she...

242
00:11:09,555 --> 00:11:11,755
Unfortunately, this is all my fault.

243
00:11:11,757 --> 00:11:13,190
You see, a month ago, I interacted

244
00:11:13,192 --> 00:11:15,926
with my younger self back in 1987

245
00:11:15,928 --> 00:11:19,597
and unwittingly motivated him...

246
00:11:19,599 --> 00:11:23,100
Me... To sire a child.

247
00:11:23,102 --> 00:11:27,338
So it's because of my carelessness

248
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,640
that this Time Aberration exists.

249
00:11:29,642 --> 00:11:31,542
She is not an Aberration.

250
00:11:31,544 --> 00:11:35,513
She is brilliant and
funny and a lot like you,

251
00:11:35,515 --> 00:11:36,981
just a little less uptight.

252
00:11:36,983 --> 00:11:39,116
Please stop talking about her like this.

253
00:11:39,118 --> 00:11:40,818
She is not a real person.

254
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:44,021
She is a real person.
She's your daughter.

255
00:11:45,391 --> 00:11:46,624
Wait.

256
00:11:46,626 --> 00:11:49,226
When we finish fighting the Dominators,

257
00:11:49,228 --> 00:11:53,297
you're gonna go back in
time and... erase her?

258
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,100
No.

259
00:11:56,102 --> 00:11:58,969
I am going to restore the timeline.

260
00:11:58,971 --> 00:12:01,505
Unlike your friend Barry,

261
00:12:01,507 --> 00:12:05,209
I have the luxury of fixing my mistakes.

262
00:12:16,188 --> 00:12:17,388
Well done.

263
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:24,061
I see that you've managed
to catch us a specimen.

264
00:12:24,063 --> 00:12:26,363
I'm afraid we're gonna
have to keep this one.

265
00:12:26,365 --> 00:12:27,598
Who are you?

266
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,700
Just a humble civil servant.

267
00:12:29,702 --> 00:12:32,369
- I don't like guys with badges.
- Easy, Mick.

268
00:12:32,371 --> 00:12:34,738
We just want to ask a few questions.

269
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,373
We'd love to answer 'em, but...

270
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:38,943
- We're in a bit of a hurry.
- So are we.

271
00:12:44,283 --> 00:12:45,716
Aah!

272
00:12:45,718 --> 00:12:48,752
You don't understand.

273
00:12:48,754 --> 00:12:51,355
We're here to save the future.

274
00:12:51,357 --> 00:12:54,658
And you can tell me all about it...

275
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,127
When you wake up.

276
00:13:00,951 --> 00:13:01,998
Crap, crap, crap.

277
00:13:02,023 --> 00:13:03,085
Where do you think they're taking them?

278
00:13:03,109 --> 00:13:04,288
Those "Men in Black"
types are probably gonna

279
00:13:04,312 --> 00:13:06,385
take 'em to a secret lab
and run experiments on them.

280
00:13:06,409 --> 00:13:09,001
- Have you seen "Stranger Things"?
- Maybe too much TV, Cisco.

281
00:13:09,026 --> 00:13:10,850
Life imitates art, Felicity.

282
00:13:10,852 --> 00:13:12,485
Either way, whether you like it or not,

283
00:13:12,487 --> 00:13:14,153
we're gonna have to be
the ones to rescue them.

284
00:13:14,155 --> 00:13:16,589
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But we're the tech support.

285
00:13:16,591 --> 00:13:20,025
No. This is tech support.

286
00:13:20,027 --> 00:13:22,506
Set your phasers to "stun."

287
00:13:23,664 --> 00:13:27,099
This is why I hate the government.

288
00:13:27,101 --> 00:13:30,803
Can't you two use your powers
and get us out of here?

289
00:13:30,805 --> 00:13:33,506
Whatever they tranqed us with
is screwing with our powers.

290
00:13:35,943 --> 00:13:38,477
Hey, he's still alive.

291
00:13:38,479 --> 00:13:39,845
Although something tells me

292
00:13:39,847 --> 00:13:42,448
none of us are gonna be alive for long.

293
00:13:43,284 --> 00:13:44,950
Wait.

294
00:13:44,952 --> 00:13:48,954
This is the exact opportunity
we've been looking for.

295
00:13:48,956 --> 00:13:50,689
To get captured?

296
00:13:50,691 --> 00:13:54,260
No. To talk with one of the Dominators.

297
00:13:54,262 --> 00:13:56,529
And find out what they
want with our planet.

298
00:13:56,531 --> 00:13:58,097
Well, this is a first.

299
00:13:58,099 --> 00:14:00,099
Talking with an alien.

300
00:14:02,069 --> 00:14:05,838
Excuse me, Mr. Alien Guy.

301
00:14:10,978 --> 00:14:13,479
So where's the president?

302
00:14:13,481 --> 00:14:15,581
She's late.

303
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:18,293
Well, you got to figure
she's got a lot on her plate,

304
00:14:18,295 --> 00:14:20,929
what with the whole alien invasion thing.

305
00:14:20,931 --> 00:14:23,131
And her predecessor getting killed.

306
00:14:23,133 --> 00:14:25,733
Hey, what'd you say to Kara earlier?

307
00:14:25,735 --> 00:14:27,368
She seemed pretty angry.

308
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:29,814
I didn't know she was
capable of being angry.

309
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,672
We've got movement.

310
00:14:52,395 --> 00:14:55,596
I'm sorry. President couldn't make it.

311
00:14:55,598 --> 00:14:57,065
Who are you?

312
00:14:57,067 --> 00:14:58,933
If I tell you...

313
00:15:00,904 --> 00:15:02,804
I'll have to kill you.

314
00:15:06,109 --> 00:15:08,176
Look,

315
00:15:08,178 --> 00:15:10,745
we just want to know why
you attacked our planet.

316
00:15:10,747 --> 00:15:13,181
I mean, we're just down here
minding our own business,

317
00:15:13,183 --> 00:15:15,683
then you guys just drop
from the sky and attack us.

318
00:15:15,685 --> 00:15:16,897
Why?

319
00:15:16,922 --> 00:15:19,928
There has been a recent emergence

320
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:23,591
of meta-humans on your planet.

321
00:15:23,593 --> 00:15:25,960
Wait. He's talking about the JSA.

322
00:15:25,962 --> 00:15:28,796
We are here to determine

323
00:15:28,798 --> 00:15:31,766
if your kind are a threat.

324
00:15:35,305 --> 00:15:37,038
Let's start with him.

325
00:15:39,275 --> 00:15:42,243
Rest of you will have to wait your turn.

326
00:15:44,146 --> 00:15:46,948
Uh, I think we have a misunderstanding.

327
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:50,585
See, we're the good guys.
The president invited us here.

328
00:15:50,587 --> 00:15:53,421
Barry, I think it's time we do something.

329
00:15:53,423 --> 00:15:55,790
And fast.

330
00:16:11,574 --> 00:16:13,608
- Sniper!
- On it.

331
00:16:44,207 --> 00:16:45,706
We're trying to help you.

332
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:47,708
This is how you thank us?

333
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,277
You don't understand.

334
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,012
The reason the xenomorphs are here...

335
00:16:51,014 --> 00:16:53,915
Because they have a
beef with the meta-humans.

336
00:16:53,917 --> 00:16:55,616
Tell us something we don't know.

337
00:16:55,618 --> 00:16:57,885
Like what exactly have we done to them?

338
00:16:57,887 --> 00:16:59,854
Nothing. Yet.

339
00:16:59,856 --> 00:17:02,824
But they see individuals
with powers such as yours

340
00:17:02,826 --> 00:17:07,628
as a future threat,
and, frankly, so do I.

341
00:17:12,168 --> 00:17:13,835
What do you think they're doing to him?

342
00:17:13,837 --> 00:17:15,269
Same thing they're gonna do to us

343
00:17:15,271 --> 00:17:16,704
unless we get out of here.

344
00:17:23,147 --> 00:17:25,480
Oh, yeah! Y'all call for tech support?

345
00:17:27,217 --> 00:17:29,650
Great. Saved by geeks.

346
00:17:29,652 --> 00:17:32,053
Waverider's ready to
take us back to 2016.

347
00:17:36,693 --> 00:17:38,726
If we leave him here,
they're gonna kill him.

348
00:17:38,728 --> 00:17:40,661
So what? He's an alien.

349
00:17:40,663 --> 00:17:42,430
Just 'cause they're douches
doesn't mean we have to be.

350
00:17:42,432 --> 00:17:44,732
- Well...
- We got to send him home.

351
00:17:44,734 --> 00:17:46,216
How?

352
00:17:46,241 --> 00:17:48,169
Don't we have one of their
ships aboard the Waverider?

353
00:17:48,171 --> 00:17:49,504
Yeah, but it's damaged.

354
00:17:49,506 --> 00:17:51,072
Felicity's gonna help me fix it.

355
00:17:51,074 --> 00:17:52,807
I am?

356
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:54,275
I'm gonna help him fix it.

357
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,594
See?

358
00:17:55,619 --> 00:17:57,545
Oh, that doesn't sound good.

359
00:17:57,547 --> 00:18:00,248
Guys, it's up to us
to show the Dominators

360
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,617
we're better than this.

361
00:18:07,857 --> 00:18:09,624
Fascinating.

362
00:18:09,626 --> 00:18:12,927
The creature's nervous
system is not unlike our own,

363
00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:16,397
which means it must be
capable of experiencing pain.

364
00:18:20,889 --> 00:18:23,304
Maybe that's why he's screaming.

365
00:18:26,843 --> 00:18:29,744
Don't worry. We're gonna
get you out of here.

366
00:18:38,188 --> 00:18:40,621
Bye.

367
00:18:40,623 --> 00:18:41,989
He didn't even say thank you.

368
00:18:41,991 --> 00:18:43,086
What is that?

369
00:18:43,111 --> 00:18:45,493
I think it's a transponder.

370
00:18:45,495 --> 00:18:47,261
Where'd you get that?

371
00:18:47,263 --> 00:18:49,730
I may or may not have stolen it.

372
00:18:49,732 --> 00:18:51,165
From his ship.

373
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:52,256
What does it do?

374
00:18:52,281 --> 00:18:54,135
I think we can use it
to communicate with him

375
00:18:54,137 --> 00:18:55,403
when we get back.

376
00:18:55,405 --> 00:18:57,171
Oh, my God, like an alien pen pal.

377
00:18:57,173 --> 00:18:59,740
- Exactly.
- You kids finished?

378
00:19:01,544 --> 00:19:03,544
- Gideon.
- Yes, Mr. Rory?

379
00:19:03,546 --> 00:19:04,879
- Prepare for, um...
- Time jump.

380
00:19:04,881 --> 00:19:06,347
- Time jump.
- Time jump.

381
00:19:06,349 --> 00:19:09,951
Course plotted for Central City, 2016.

382
00:19:14,791 --> 00:19:17,225
If you're such BFFs
with the Dominators...

383
00:19:17,227 --> 00:19:19,093
Then why don't you call them off?

384
00:19:19,095 --> 00:19:21,929
We know you sent them packing
once before, back in 1951.

385
00:19:21,931 --> 00:19:23,998
That was just a reconnaissance mission.

386
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
What brought them back?

387
00:19:26,936 --> 00:19:28,502
You did, Mr. Allen.

388
00:19:30,873 --> 00:19:32,073
He knows who you are.

389
00:19:32,075 --> 00:19:33,541
You threatened the entire universe

390
00:19:33,543 --> 00:19:35,009
when you used your powers

391
00:19:35,011 --> 00:19:37,144
to upset the normal course of time.

392
00:19:37,146 --> 00:19:38,980
You're talking about Flashpoint?

393
00:19:38,982 --> 00:19:40,147
How do you even know about...

394
00:19:40,149 --> 00:19:41,249
They told us.

395
00:19:41,251 --> 00:19:42,326
I made a mistake. Okay?

396
00:19:42,351 --> 00:19:44,018
I'm not gonna let it happen again.

397
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,252
For the past 60 years,

398
00:19:45,277 --> 00:19:49,223
we have enjoyed a truce with
your so-called Dominators.

399
00:19:49,225 --> 00:19:51,859
You broke the truce.

400
00:19:51,861 --> 00:19:53,094
What do they want?

401
00:19:53,096 --> 00:19:55,997
I've negotiated a deal with them.

402
00:19:55,999 --> 00:19:59,634
If Mr. Allen surrenders himself...

403
00:20:01,504 --> 00:20:04,338
They will leave us in peace.

404
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,707
You really want to save the world?

405
00:20:06,709 --> 00:20:09,310
Here's your chance.

406
00:20:24,219 --> 00:20:25,785
I can't see. Why can't I see?

407
00:20:25,787 --> 00:20:27,120
At least you're not throwing up.

408
00:20:27,122 --> 00:20:28,888
Oh.

409
00:20:30,258 --> 00:20:32,792
- What's it doing?
- I don't know.

410
00:20:32,794 --> 00:20:35,862
Either our food's ready or
this guy's trying to call us.

411
00:20:35,864 --> 00:20:37,773
Hey, how... how do... How do I answer?

412
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:39,130
I...

413
00:20:42,037 --> 00:20:45,004
Hey. Oh, my God. It's him.

414
00:20:45,006 --> 00:20:48,441
He's even uglier than
the last time we saw him.

415
00:20:48,443 --> 00:20:51,015
65 of your years ago,

416
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:54,414
you saved me from capture.

417
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:56,216
Listen, you don't need to thank us.

418
00:20:56,218 --> 00:20:57,350
Yeah, he does.

419
00:20:57,352 --> 00:20:58,751
He can thank us by turning around

420
00:20:58,753 --> 00:21:00,386
and heading home.

421
00:21:00,388 --> 00:21:04,491
I will show you my gratitude
by sparing your lives,

422
00:21:04,493 --> 00:21:08,683
but I cannot do the same for Barry Allen.

423
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:12,398
If your friend does not turn himself in,

424
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,436
we will have no choice
but to deploy a weapon

425
00:21:16,438 --> 00:21:21,574
that will exterminate all meta-humans.

426
00:21:26,214 --> 00:21:27,647
It's a trap.

427
00:21:27,649 --> 00:21:29,516
If they're that threatened
by meta-humans,

428
00:21:29,518 --> 00:21:31,484
it's hard to believe they'd
be satisfied with just one.

429
00:21:31,486 --> 00:21:32,719
Yeah, well, if I know Barry,

430
00:21:32,721 --> 00:21:34,049
he's gonna want to be that one.

431
00:21:34,074 --> 00:21:35,922
Well, Oliver's trying
to talk him out of it.

432
00:21:35,924 --> 00:21:37,323
And if he does,
what's the collateral damage

433
00:21:37,325 --> 00:21:38,358
of the meta-bomb?

434
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,826
Projected casualty count

435
00:21:39,828 --> 00:21:41,761
is around 2 million non-meta-humans.

436
00:21:41,763 --> 00:21:43,530
Okay, so what if we negotiated with them?

437
00:21:43,532 --> 00:21:44,855
Yeah, I don't know if you noticed,

438
00:21:44,879 --> 00:21:46,432
but our last chat with
him didn't go so well.

439
00:21:46,434 --> 00:21:47,767
Well, what've we got to lose?

440
00:21:47,769 --> 00:21:50,136
Look, maybe we should contact them.

441
00:21:50,138 --> 00:21:51,638
Then make it fast.

442
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,273
We've got incoming.

443
00:21:55,243 --> 00:21:57,143
Dominator ships are coming in worldwide.

444
00:21:57,145 --> 00:21:58,912
Including Central City.

445
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:05,718
Yeah, but they're not moving or anything.

446
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,353
- They're just sitting there.
- For now.

447
00:22:07,355 --> 00:22:10,523
So much for the truce
Secret Agent Man negotiated.

448
00:22:10,525 --> 00:22:14,661
They're trying to leverage
us into handing Barry over.

449
00:22:14,663 --> 00:22:16,529
Contact the Dominators.

450
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,600
Looks like your friend's
not calling you back.

451
00:22:20,602 --> 00:22:22,569
No, he's not, but I got a plan B.

452
00:22:22,571 --> 00:22:24,971
- Okay.
- If this came from the dropship

453
00:22:24,973 --> 00:22:26,539
and the dropship came
from the mother ship,

454
00:22:26,541 --> 00:22:28,575
theoretically, I could use
it to vibe us up there.

455
00:22:28,577 --> 00:22:30,343
And if you can't?

456
00:22:30,345 --> 00:22:32,679
Then I'd be vibing us into the cold,

457
00:22:32,681 --> 00:22:34,480
unforgiving vacuum of space.

458
00:22:34,482 --> 00:22:36,749
- So let's not do that.
- Yeah, let's not. Okay.

459
00:22:48,396 --> 00:22:51,064
What an unusual gift.

460
00:22:51,066 --> 00:22:54,334
You appear to be a meta-human as well.

461
00:22:54,336 --> 00:22:56,369
Yeah, well, I figured
you'd cut me some slack,

462
00:22:56,371 --> 00:22:59,205
seeing as how we saved you back in 1951.

463
00:22:59,207 --> 00:23:00,673
Remember that?

464
00:23:00,675 --> 00:23:02,342
Much has changed on your planet

465
00:23:02,344 --> 00:23:04,410
in the last 60 years.

466
00:23:04,412 --> 00:23:08,381
The threat of your kind
has become imminent.

467
00:23:08,383 --> 00:23:10,283
Listen, E.T. We're not a threat.

468
00:23:10,285 --> 00:23:12,652
Metas are protecting this planet.

469
00:23:12,654 --> 00:23:14,787
And besides, the guy who
tortured your ugly ass

470
00:23:14,789 --> 00:23:16,689
back in 1951 was human.

471
00:23:16,691 --> 00:23:20,026
But what happens when a man like him

472
00:23:20,028 --> 00:23:23,363
inherits abilities like yours?

473
00:23:23,365 --> 00:23:28,568
We have seen it happen on
countless other worlds,

474
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:32,705
which is why we must
exterminate your kind

475
00:23:32,707 --> 00:23:36,009
before the scourge of your planet

476
00:23:36,011 --> 00:23:39,712
becomes the scourge of ours.

477
00:23:44,586 --> 00:23:47,287
Well, he's out of his giant mind.

478
00:23:47,289 --> 00:23:48,648
What if he's right?

479
00:23:48,673 --> 00:23:50,923
What if, in using our powers
to make the world better,

480
00:23:50,925 --> 00:23:52,759
we actually end up destroying it?

481
00:23:52,761 --> 00:23:54,327
Dude, I get it. Barry screwed up.

482
00:23:54,329 --> 00:23:55,995
Yeah, so did we.

483
00:23:55,997 --> 00:23:57,664
Back in 1951.

484
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,600
We messed with time

485
00:24:00,602 --> 00:24:02,268
when we freed the Dominator.

486
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,003
Who's now coming to kill us.

487
00:24:07,509 --> 00:24:11,344
This whole time, I've been mad at Barry,

488
00:24:11,346 --> 00:24:14,347
and now I'm the one who messed with time.

489
00:24:16,217 --> 00:24:20,987
I just wanted to make things right,

490
00:24:20,989 --> 00:24:23,790
and we ended up making them worse.

491
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:31,364
I'm an idiot.

492
00:24:31,366 --> 00:24:35,168
Can't stabilize the nanomolecular reaction.

493
00:24:36,204 --> 00:24:37,730
Damn it!

494
00:24:41,309 --> 00:24:42,675
Well...

495
00:24:44,212 --> 00:24:46,012
Speaking as a daughter,

496
00:24:46,014 --> 00:24:49,215
I'm not sure that outburst had
anything to do with our project.

497
00:24:49,217 --> 00:24:51,117
What, you think it's related to me?

498
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:53,252
She doesn't know that you
think she's an Aberration.

499
00:24:53,254 --> 00:24:55,855
All she knows is that her father
is keeping her at arm's length.

500
00:24:55,857 --> 00:24:57,590
The world is being invaded by aliens.

501
00:24:57,592 --> 00:24:59,792
I don't think this is the
time for family therapy.

502
00:24:59,794 --> 00:25:03,129
It is, when the world's best
chance at a workable weapon

503
00:25:03,131 --> 00:25:06,032
is focused on getting
her daddy to love her.

504
00:25:14,142 --> 00:25:15,508
Lily?

505
00:25:17,078 --> 00:25:19,912
I'm sorry.

506
00:25:19,914 --> 00:25:23,216
Mom always said I got my temper from you.

507
00:25:23,218 --> 00:25:27,653
No, no. I'm the one who owes the apology.

508
00:25:27,655 --> 00:25:29,789
If it feels like I've
been keeping my distance,

509
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:33,059
I assure you, it's nothing personal.

510
00:25:33,061 --> 00:25:35,828
Yeah, it... It feels personal.

511
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:39,665
No, I mean, it's not personal to you.

512
00:25:39,667 --> 00:25:41,634
I'm sorry. I wish I could explain,

513
00:25:41,636 --> 00:25:44,270
but my life has gotten
rather complicated lately.

514
00:25:44,272 --> 00:25:46,172
So?

515
00:25:46,174 --> 00:25:49,388
You raised me to enjoy complexity.

516
00:25:49,413 --> 00:25:50,712
That's...

517
00:25:51,913 --> 00:25:54,914
The nanomolecular reaction
keeps breaking down

518
00:25:54,916 --> 00:25:58,151
because the replication
is sequential, not...

519
00:25:58,153 --> 00:26:00,720
Exponential.

520
00:26:00,722 --> 00:26:04,357
The reaction requires greater complexity.

521
00:26:04,359 --> 00:26:05,958
Yeah.

522
00:26:09,164 --> 00:26:12,565
Why are you looking at me like that?

523
00:26:12,567 --> 00:26:15,268
Because I truly believe

524
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:18,337
I'm seeing you for the first time.

525
00:26:24,212 --> 00:26:25,578
What is it?

526
00:26:26,748 --> 00:26:29,449
My friend Barry.

527
00:26:29,451 --> 00:26:32,318
He's about to do something terrible.

528
00:26:33,188 --> 00:26:35,922
This isn't up for debate.

529
00:26:35,924 --> 00:26:39,225
It's not even a close call. I mean...

530
00:26:39,227 --> 00:26:40,660
Turn myself over to the Dominators,

531
00:26:40,662 --> 00:26:42,995
they leave the rest of the world alone.

532
00:26:43,898 --> 00:26:45,131
Simple.

533
00:26:45,133 --> 00:26:46,258
No, it's not simple.

534
00:26:46,283 --> 00:26:48,034
Barry, it doesn't matter
what you've done.

535
00:26:48,036 --> 00:26:49,125
You can't do this.

536
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:51,103
It's been an honor to know all of you,

537
00:26:51,105 --> 00:26:53,206
to fight alongside of you.

538
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:56,843
Now it's up to you to keep our home safe.

539
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,449
Barry!

540
00:27:03,451 --> 00:27:05,852
I'm not letting you leave.

541
00:27:07,155 --> 00:27:10,022
No offense, Oliver, but
you and what army?

542
00:27:12,727 --> 00:27:14,927
This one.

543
00:27:17,398 --> 00:27:19,866
Listen, Red. I don't like you.

544
00:27:19,868 --> 00:27:21,834
But when you got a crew,

545
00:27:21,836 --> 00:27:24,303
you don't take a hit for the rest.

546
00:27:32,413 --> 00:27:34,313
That was actually pretty inspiring.

547
00:27:34,315 --> 00:27:35,611
I mean, up until the point

548
00:27:35,636 --> 00:27:37,783
that Mick compared us to a
bunch of criminals, but...

549
00:27:37,785 --> 00:27:40,853
According to the Dominators,
we might as well be.

550
00:27:40,855 --> 00:27:42,421
And maybe they're right.

551
00:27:42,423 --> 00:27:43,856
Maybe we do more harm than good,

552
00:27:43,858 --> 00:27:46,359
but this is our chance to find out.

553
00:27:46,361 --> 00:27:48,928
We're not letting you sacrifice yourself.

554
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:50,796
There's no way.

555
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:53,199
I don't care if that's
what it means to be a hero.

556
00:27:53,201 --> 00:27:55,902
You're not a hero to me.

557
00:27:57,205 --> 00:27:59,405
You're my friend.

558
00:28:01,476 --> 00:28:03,009
Yo. Guys.

559
00:28:03,011 --> 00:28:05,611
You know that ship that
landed in Central City?

560
00:28:06,414 --> 00:28:08,214
It's opening up.

561
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,519
Here we go.

562
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,492
Reading reports of ships
opening all over the world.

563
00:28:21,494 --> 00:28:23,080
- Oh, frak.
- Talk to me.

564
00:28:23,105 --> 00:28:25,096
Something from the Dominators'
mothership just broke atmo,

565
00:28:25,098 --> 00:28:26,931
and, not to get too technical,
but it's really, really big

566
00:28:26,933 --> 00:28:28,199
and falling to Earth really, really fast.

567
00:28:28,201 --> 00:28:29,273
It's the meta-bomb.

568
00:28:29,298 --> 00:28:30,788
Why would the uglies drop ships on us

569
00:28:30,813 --> 00:28:32,514
if they're just planning
on blowing us up?

570
00:28:32,539 --> 00:28:34,739
Because the ships were a distraction

571
00:28:34,741 --> 00:28:37,341
to keep us from stopping the meta-bomb.

572
00:28:39,112 --> 00:28:42,079
Too bad, 'cause we're gonna stop it.

573
00:28:42,081 --> 00:28:43,648
We're gonna stop it, right?

574
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,049
Let's hope.

575
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,253
We have to keep the Dominators at bay.

576
00:28:49,255 --> 00:28:50,146
This might help.

577
00:28:50,171 --> 00:28:52,023
I've mass-produced a small device

578
00:28:52,025 --> 00:28:53,891
that, when placed
on individual Dominators,

579
00:28:53,893 --> 00:28:55,960
will cause indescribable agony.

580
00:28:55,962 --> 00:28:58,796
Not the nicest invention,
but this is war.

581
00:28:58,798 --> 00:28:59,830
Nice going.

582
00:28:59,832 --> 00:29:00,688
The caveat, of course,

583
00:29:00,712 --> 00:29:02,132
is that if we activate the weapons

584
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,936
before all the devices are
placed on the Dominators,

585
00:29:04,938 --> 00:29:06,437
they'll know what we're up to.

586
00:29:06,439 --> 00:29:08,206
Well, we got to do it fast.

587
00:29:08,208 --> 00:29:10,007
Only way I know how.

588
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,713
Whoa.

589
00:29:15,715 --> 00:29:17,682
Damn, that's big.

590
00:29:17,684 --> 00:29:19,550
I didn't think it was gonna be so big.

591
00:29:19,552 --> 00:29:21,352
- What are we gonna do?
- You got me.

592
00:29:21,354 --> 00:29:24,589
I only know how to stab,
punch, or skewer things.

593
00:30:00,393 --> 00:30:02,560
Fry, you freaks!

594
00:30:18,111 --> 00:30:20,745
See you later, Dominator.

595
00:30:42,769 --> 00:30:44,869
This thing has to have
a tractor beam, right?

596
00:30:44,871 --> 00:30:45,936
Yep.

597
00:30:54,514 --> 00:30:56,681
It's slowing down, but, like, barely.

598
00:30:56,683 --> 00:30:59,750
Thank you, Cisco. I haven't noticed.

599
00:30:59,752 --> 00:31:01,118
Strap in.

600
00:31:02,654 --> 00:31:04,088
Firestorm, if you're done playing

601
00:31:04,090 --> 00:31:05,389
with your friends out there,

602
00:31:05,391 --> 00:31:06,724
we could really use your help.

603
00:31:06,726 --> 00:31:08,092
I'm on it.

604
00:31:23,776 --> 00:31:25,676
Oof!

605
00:31:45,298 --> 00:31:47,531
Good work planting Professor
Stein's nano-weapons,

606
00:31:47,533 --> 00:31:49,867
but we still got Dominators
all over the country.

607
00:31:49,869 --> 00:31:52,570
This looks like a job for Supergirl.

608
00:31:55,875 --> 00:31:57,308
Thanks, Felicity.

609
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,909
I'm not the least bit insulted.

610
00:31:58,911 --> 00:32:00,778
Ah, sorry. I meant Supergirl and Flash.

611
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,413
This is totally a job for the both of you.

612
00:32:02,415 --> 00:32:05,549
That's what I meant.
Supergirl and... Flash.

613
00:32:10,957 --> 00:32:12,790
Firestorm, we're holding it up.

614
00:32:12,792 --> 00:32:16,560
- But, like, barely.
- Not helping, Cisco.

615
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:21,098
- Firestorm, do it now!
- Do what?

616
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,867
I believe Ms. Lance intends for us

617
00:32:22,869 --> 00:32:25,202
to transmute the meta-bomb
into something harmless.

618
00:32:25,204 --> 00:32:27,905
I was afraid you were gonna say that.

619
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:39,817
All right, devices are being planted.

620
00:32:39,819 --> 00:32:42,486
Let me know when I can bring the pain.

621
00:32:43,723 --> 00:32:45,689
Come on, Firestorm.

622
00:32:48,127 --> 00:32:51,362
Grey, I can't do it, man. It's too big.

623
00:32:51,364 --> 00:32:53,798
Still waiting on that signal.

624
00:32:56,102 --> 00:32:57,401
Do it!

625
00:32:59,705 --> 00:33:00,671
Done.

626
00:33:03,176 --> 00:33:07,211
- It's working.
- What about the superhero bomb?

627
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:13,184
I can't! I can't do it!

628
00:33:13,186 --> 00:33:14,718
You must, Jefferson.

629
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,387
I have a daughter.

630
00:33:16,389 --> 00:33:19,056
Her name is Lily,
and she's counting on you.

631
00:33:19,058 --> 00:33:21,592
She's counting on both of us.

632
00:33:30,636 --> 00:33:32,470
They did it!

633
00:33:33,339 --> 00:33:35,072
They can do that?

634
00:33:35,074 --> 00:33:36,807
They did that.

635
00:33:36,809 --> 00:33:38,676
Ground, what's your status?

636
00:33:44,617 --> 00:33:46,116
They're retreating.

637
00:33:46,118 --> 00:33:47,751
It's not just them.

638
00:33:49,889 --> 00:33:51,889
It's all around the world.

639
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:01,165
He did it.

640
00:34:01,167 --> 00:34:04,401
- No, Oliver...
- We all did it.

641
00:34:19,556 --> 00:34:22,757
Many responsibilities have fallen to me

642
00:34:22,759 --> 00:34:26,928
since the president's passing
at the beginning of this crisis.

643
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:30,999
Sobering, sad responsibilities.

644
00:34:31,001 --> 00:34:34,235
This is not one of them.

645
00:34:34,237 --> 00:34:38,347
Today, it is my distinct
honor to bestow upon you

646
00:34:38,372 --> 00:34:41,943
a small acknowledgement of the great debt

647
00:34:41,945 --> 00:34:44,030
that the world owes to you all.

648
00:34:44,055 --> 00:34:46,489
Is it just me, or is she really hot?

649
00:34:46,491 --> 00:34:49,392
Although your brave efforts
must remain a secret...

650
00:34:49,394 --> 00:34:50,593
She's hot.

651
00:34:50,595 --> 00:34:53,329
Know that, meta-human or not,

652
00:34:53,331 --> 00:34:56,466
masked or not,

653
00:34:56,468 --> 00:35:00,737
each and every one of you is a hero.

654
00:35:07,412 --> 00:35:09,078
Whoo!

655
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,580
Whoa.

656
00:35:10,582 --> 00:35:11,848
Thank you.

657
00:35:16,154 --> 00:35:18,755
Hmm, hmm? Let's go drink.

658
00:35:18,757 --> 00:35:19,989
Cheers.

659
00:35:24,129 --> 00:35:26,829
It's like looking into a mirror.

660
00:35:26,831 --> 00:35:28,364
Yeah, you know what's funny?

661
00:35:28,366 --> 00:35:31,434
She really kind of looks like my cousin.

662
00:35:32,737 --> 00:35:34,537
- Hey, hey. Guys.
- Hey.

663
00:35:34,539 --> 00:35:36,239
Either of you ever save
the world before?

664
00:35:36,241 --> 00:35:38,041
- Mm-hmm.
- Last year.

665
00:35:38,043 --> 00:35:39,542
It doesn't get old, does it?

666
00:35:39,567 --> 00:35:41,752
Nope. It sure beats
screwing up the world.

667
00:35:41,777 --> 00:35:43,822
Hey, you are too hard on yourself.

668
00:35:43,847 --> 00:35:45,348
That's what people usually tell me.

669
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:47,717
And for good reason, I'm sure.

670
00:35:47,719 --> 00:35:51,654
But, back on my Earth,
it's just me and my cousin.

671
00:35:51,656 --> 00:35:53,856
Between the two of us,
we're more powerful than...

672
00:35:53,858 --> 00:35:55,525
Yeah, everybody in this room combined.

673
00:35:55,527 --> 00:35:58,027
No, no. That's the point.

674
00:35:58,029 --> 00:36:00,997
That's what you've all proven here.

675
00:36:00,999 --> 00:36:04,801
Meta-humans an not, superpowers or not,

676
00:36:04,803 --> 00:36:07,670
you are Earth's mightiest heroes.

677
00:36:08,315 --> 00:36:10,173
Um...

678
00:36:10,175 --> 00:36:12,942
I owe you an apology.

679
00:36:12,944 --> 00:36:17,346
Keeping you at arm's length
was the wrong move, and...

680
00:36:17,348 --> 00:36:19,082
Well, the truth is that this Earth

681
00:36:19,084 --> 00:36:21,084
could probably use a Supergirl.

682
00:36:21,086 --> 00:36:23,052
Well, that's... that's funny,
'cause I was just thinking

683
00:36:23,054 --> 00:36:25,455
my Earth could use an Oliver Queen.

684
00:36:28,593 --> 00:36:31,060
I know you said you don't get unnerved...

685
00:36:31,062 --> 00:36:34,997
But if you did,

686
00:36:34,999 --> 00:36:39,969
I think hardship is what
makes us stronger.

687
00:36:39,971 --> 00:36:41,537
That's probably why these people

688
00:36:41,539 --> 00:36:43,473
look to you as their rock.

689
00:36:45,243 --> 00:36:46,642
You guys feeling the group hug?

690
00:36:46,644 --> 00:36:48,377
- No.
- Come on. Come on.

691
00:36:48,379 --> 00:36:50,980
All right.

692
00:36:52,717 --> 00:36:54,150
Hey, Kara.

693
00:36:54,152 --> 00:36:55,918
- I made you something.
- What?

694
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,520
- Cisco.
- Yeah.

695
00:36:58,229 --> 00:37:01,958
What, uh... What is it?

696
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,493
Oh, it's a...

697
00:37:03,495 --> 00:37:05,461
It's an inter-dimensional extrapolator.

698
00:37:05,463 --> 00:37:07,663
- Oh, I...
- It creates small breaches,

699
00:37:07,665 --> 00:37:10,066
so you can use it to
cross over to our universe

700
00:37:10,068 --> 00:37:11,367
any time you need to.

701
00:37:11,369 --> 00:37:14,504
Oh, my God. That's amazing.

702
00:37:14,506 --> 00:37:16,772
I also included
communication functionality,

703
00:37:16,774 --> 00:37:20,476
so if you ever need any help,
you can always contact the team.

704
00:37:20,478 --> 00:37:22,111
Hey, Skirt.

705
00:37:22,113 --> 00:37:23,713
Call me.

706
00:37:34,759 --> 00:37:37,493
All right, Grey. Spill.

707
00:37:37,495 --> 00:37:39,195
How is it you have a kid?

708
00:37:39,197 --> 00:37:40,563
I didn't think I had to explain

709
00:37:40,565 --> 00:37:41,931
such matters to you, Jefferson.

710
00:37:41,933 --> 00:37:43,900
Come on. You know what I mean.

711
00:37:46,437 --> 00:37:48,704
When we traveled back to 1987,

712
00:37:48,706 --> 00:37:50,873
I gave my younger self a lecture

713
00:37:50,875 --> 00:37:54,977
about neglecting Clarissa, and he...

714
00:37:54,979 --> 00:37:58,748
And he followed your advice
all the way to pound town.

715
00:38:00,084 --> 00:38:01,217
Wait.

716
00:38:01,219 --> 00:38:03,286
You created an Aberration.

717
00:38:03,288 --> 00:38:05,388
Which is why you cannot tell the team.

718
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:06,789
If you don't want me to tell the team,

719
00:38:06,791 --> 00:38:08,658
that means you...

720
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:15,164
I do not want to lose my daughter.

721
00:38:22,006 --> 00:38:24,173
Something tells me you
weren't invited here.

722
00:38:24,175 --> 00:38:26,542
- Dr. Heywood.
- Don't "Dr. Heywood" me.

723
00:38:26,544 --> 00:38:27,920
What the hell are you doing here?

724
00:38:27,945 --> 00:38:30,746
I like parties,
and I'm here for the mop-up.

725
00:38:30,748 --> 00:38:33,749
Cover-up. But you can't cover this up.

726
00:38:33,751 --> 00:38:35,451
Agent Smith!

727
00:38:35,453 --> 00:38:37,220
It's so funny seeing you here.

728
00:38:37,222 --> 00:38:38,854
I was just having the loveliest chat

729
00:38:38,856 --> 00:38:40,623
with your president about you.

730
00:38:40,625 --> 00:38:42,124
I was telling her, on my Earth,

731
00:38:42,126 --> 00:38:44,227
we have a Department of
Extranormal Operations,

732
00:38:44,229 --> 00:38:47,163
which deals specifically with aliens.

733
00:38:47,165 --> 00:38:49,332
She thought as an excellent idea.

734
00:38:49,334 --> 00:38:50,900
She also loved my pitch

735
00:38:50,902 --> 00:38:53,603
about reassigning you to Antarctica.

736
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,410
Maybe next time, you're a little nicer

737
00:39:01,412 --> 00:39:03,846
to strange visitors from another planet.

738
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:08,317
Pack a jacket!

739
00:39:08,319 --> 00:39:10,586
You ready to see if Cisco's gadget works?

740
00:39:10,588 --> 00:39:12,021
Ready.

741
00:39:12,023 --> 00:39:14,390
And remember, if you guys ever need me,

742
00:39:14,392 --> 00:39:15,758
I'm just a call away.

743
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,026
Same here.

744
00:39:29,007 --> 00:39:31,707
It's weird to think
that all of this started

745
00:39:31,709 --> 00:39:34,277
with the two of us.

746
00:39:34,279 --> 00:39:36,212
You ever think what it would be like

747
00:39:36,214 --> 00:39:37,880
if we never got on that boat?

748
00:39:37,882 --> 00:39:40,816
I don't know if I have to think about it.

749
00:39:40,818 --> 00:39:42,318
I mean, maybe the Dominators showed us

750
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,553
what our lives would have been like.

751
00:39:45,857 --> 00:39:48,647
I know it was a prison, but in a way...

752
00:39:48,672 --> 00:39:50,872
In a way, it was a gift.

753
00:39:56,968 --> 00:39:59,769
- Stay out of trouble.
- Yeah.

754
00:40:04,976 --> 00:40:08,110
There she goes, off to her spaceship,

755
00:40:08,112 --> 00:40:11,047
time traveling as if it's totally normal.

756
00:40:11,049 --> 00:40:13,249
Well, John, it's like you said.

757
00:40:13,251 --> 00:40:14,984
Normal sort of went out the window

758
00:40:14,986 --> 00:40:17,453
when this one arrived.

759
00:40:17,455 --> 00:40:21,490
I may never understand you, man, but...

760
00:40:21,492 --> 00:40:23,926
you're one of the best men I know.

761
00:40:23,928 --> 00:40:25,394
Thanks, Dig.

762
00:40:26,531 --> 00:40:31,237
So... you forgive me for what I did?

763
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,235
Barry, it's like I keep telling this guy.

764
00:40:33,237 --> 00:40:35,404
You have to forgive yourself.

765
00:40:35,406 --> 00:40:37,440
- Yeah.
- Good luck.

766
00:40:37,442 --> 00:40:39,308
Yeah, thanks.

767
00:40:40,378 --> 00:40:42,878
Well, we got to do this more often.

768
00:40:42,903 --> 00:40:44,395
Get together, I mean.

769
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,415
I don't know if the world could take it.

770
00:40:46,417 --> 00:40:48,918
I meant, like, without the
world being threatened.

771
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,954
If the world wasn't being threatened,

772
00:40:51,956 --> 00:40:54,457
what would we do?

773
00:40:58,062 --> 00:40:59,395
I'm just saying,

774
00:40:59,397 --> 00:41:01,497
next time, I'm gonna get you.

775
00:41:01,499 --> 00:41:03,165
I'm just saying, I beat you twice.

776
00:41:03,167 --> 00:41:06,001
- The first time was a tie.
- And the second time?

777
00:41:06,003 --> 00:41:08,437
There were no witnesses the second time.

778
00:41:10,375 --> 00:41:12,808
Superspeed arrow duels...

779
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:15,144
Our lives aren't exactly normal.

780
00:41:15,146 --> 00:41:20,249
I told Kara that I was
looking to reclaim some normal.

781
00:41:20,251 --> 00:41:25,087
Thinking on it now, I'm... I'm not so sure.

782
00:41:25,089 --> 00:41:26,989
I know what you mean.

783
00:41:26,991 --> 00:41:31,427
We both got a look at what
life would look like normal.

784
00:41:31,429 --> 00:41:33,662
It would've been happy.

785
00:41:33,664 --> 00:41:35,765
But not full.

786
00:41:35,767 --> 00:41:39,168
No. No, nowhere close.

787
00:41:40,304 --> 00:41:43,305
To things not being normal.

788
00:41:43,307 --> 00:41:44,673
To life being full.

789
00:41:52,752 --> 00:41:58,482
