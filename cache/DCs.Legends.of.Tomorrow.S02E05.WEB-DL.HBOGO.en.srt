1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,120
<i>Time travel is real
and all of history</i>

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,880
<i>is vulnerable to attack which is why</i>

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,040
<i>we must travel through time
to stop the spread</i>

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,960
<i>of these so-called time aberrations
and to erase their damage to history.</i>

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,920
<i>We are a team
of outcasts and misfits,</i>

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
<i>so please don't call us heroes.</i>

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,640
<i>We're something else, we're legends.</i>

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,720
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,440
I'd forgotten how handsome I was.

10
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,640
Hi, I'm Marty.

11
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,920
Have a wonderful life, Martin.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,320
This belonged to the greatest
outsider I ever knew.

13
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,880
I'm looking for a partner.

14
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,680
Hello, Rex.

15
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,520
With his last words, he told me
his killer was a time traveler.

16
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,200
Damien Darhk murdered my sister.

17
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,560
If I take him out here...

18
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,200
You save her. We gotta let him go.

19
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,880
So it's all here, then?

20
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,000
Every sweet-smelling speck of it.

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,200
As for my compensation?

22
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:03,880
Strange form of payment.

23
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,840
Why this and not cash?

24
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,720
Everyone has a hobby.

25
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,320
Some men collect stamps.

26
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,000
I collect relics.

27
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,440
This "thing" is called a fasces,

28
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,520
a ceremonial axe carried
by the bodyguard of Emperor Nero

29
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,760
from which a term "fascism" derived.

30
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,640
No?

31
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,840
A form of rule, which, in my opinion,
is getting a bit of a bad rap lately.

32
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,240
DEA! Get your hands in the air, now!

33
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,120
You know, I had this under control.

34
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,360
My way's faster.

35
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,840
Speed isn't everything, Mr. Thawne.

36
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,880
You should've learned
that lesson by now.

37
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,480
What's it been, 45 years
since you hired me to nuke New York?

38
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,000
Well, 45 years for you,
maybe, but for me?

39
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,720
Good seeing you again, old friend.

40
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,400
Old? That's fair. Friend?

41
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,080
Now that's something
that has to be earned.

42
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,760
Lovely piece. What is this?

43
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,000
First century AD,
if I'm not mistaken?

44
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,240
What is it that you want?

45
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,200
A partner.

46
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,280
Pass, I prefer to work alone.

47
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,800
Oh, yeah, gathering
your hive of followers,

48
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,960
building your empire,
designing your ark.

49
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,640
Yeah, I know what you're planning.

50
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,080
And how it works out.

51
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,240
You want to reshape the world?

52
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,800
Try reshaping history.

53
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,560
Try rewriting destiny...

54
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,040
Try putting our partnership
into concrete terms,

55
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,760
as in, what's in it for me?

56
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,400
Well, perhaps content collecting
symbols of power, but...

57
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,240
I can give you actual power.

58
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,760
We have the tools
to make a difference.

59
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,040
We can make history better.

60
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,680
{\an5}Even if we act
with the best of intentions,

61
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,920
{\an5}these changes can ripple
throughout time,

62
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,400
{\an5}a temporal domino effect
with disastrous consequences.

63
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,800
So we start small.

64
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,320
Make changes we can control.

65
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,040
{\an5}What you're talking
about can't be done.

66
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,120
{\an5}It's, it's like playing God,
and it goes against everything

67
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,200
we're trying to do.

68
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,120
I thought we were
trying to help people.

69
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,400
We're helping by fixing aberrations,
not creating them.

70
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,120
{\an5}You're not thinking
fourth dimensionally.

71
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,880
Did you really
just use Doc Brown on me?

72
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,000
Who the hell is that?

73
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,840
Sara, come on, you can't
be Switzerland on this one.

74
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,120
In my heart, I agree with you...

75
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,640
{\an5}but that's not what Rip
entrusted us to do.

76
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,240
Our job is to protect history.

77
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,320
{\an5}You mean clean it up
after somebody else

78
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,440
makes a mess of it.

79
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,040
Time janitors...

80
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,320
That's all we are.

81
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,640
Easy, point and shoot.

82
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,720
You're up.

83
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,320
All right, point and shoot.

84
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,200
You killed my beers.

85
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,360
Come on, the trigger's
really sensitive,

86
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,680
and these goggles make
everything look blue.

87
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,280
You know, it'd be really easy

88
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,880
{\an5}for me to improve
this whole setup by just

89
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,200
iterating the power source.

90
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,360
There's nothing wrong with the gun.

91
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,960
You've just gotta be cool.

92
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,040
Like Snart.

93
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,800
Yeah, I can be cool.

94
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,480
What are you doing?

95
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,160
Trying to be cool.

96
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,920
Maybe this was a bad idea.

97
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,800
You know, this may shock you,

98
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,440
but I was considered extremely cool

99
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,120
when I left my cushy six-figure
Silicon Valley job

100
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,560
and started my own tech company.

101
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,680
Ladies were lining up.

102
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,800
{\an5}Listen, Haircut, if you want to fit
into Snart's shoes,

103
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,840
{\an5}you gotta find the pain,
the darkness, the anger.

104
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,480
You got it in you?

105
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,880
{\an5}Call me Haircut again
and I'll ice you.

106
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,800
Not bad.

107
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,920
Hey, what are you doing?

108
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,480
A little side project

109
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,800
I've been working on
with Ray and the professor.

110
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:21,920
{\an5}It said that temporal aberrations
cause these things called timequakes.

111
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
So I started thinking,

112
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,800
{\an5}if there was a way
of locating their epicenters,

113
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,360
{\an5}maybe we'll be able to fix
the aberrations before they happen.

114
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,040
Like a time seismograph.

115
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,360
That's an awesome name,
and I'm totally gonna steal that.

116
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,840
{\an5}If the JSA could get even a glimpse
of all this, they would...

117
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,920
They'd what?

118
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,560
Never mind.

119
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,640
Hey, wait.

120
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,080
{\an5}We've barely had half a conversation
since you came on board,

121
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,880
{\an5}and you were friends
with my grandfather.

122
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,360
Talk to me.
What was he like as a person?

123
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,120
Your grandfather was a great man.

124
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,200
That's it? He's a great man?

125
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,960
Is it because your missions
were classified, or is it

126
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,280
because you really didn't
know him well as a person?

127
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,840
It's because the JSA didn't encourage
its members to fraternize.

128
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,080
Something you and your team
should consider.

129
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,120
It worked?

130
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,600
Oh, it worked all right.

131
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,160
Where's it coming from?

132
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,880
Washington D.C., December 7, 1987.
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

133
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,720
- So?
- Dude, that's the White House.

134
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,560
- So what?
- December 7th was the day

135
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,520
before Reagan and Gorbachev
signed the INF Treaty,

136
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,280
reducing both countries'
nuclear arsenals

137
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,240
and paving the way for the end
of the Cold War.

138
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,360
- How do you know all that?
- Because I was in the capital

139
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,440
for that very summit.

140
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,120
The Reagan Administration
would call upon the top

141
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,760
nuclear physicists
to act as technical advisors.

142
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,320
You think someone might have
traveled back in time

143
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,000
to stop the treaty from being signed?

144
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,600
That, or worse.

145
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,160
Think about it, Reagan
and Gorbachev under the same roof

146
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,280
at one of the most
volatile moments in history?

147
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,680
The JSA has a training
academy in D.C.

148
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,400
I could reach out
to the current membership,

149
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,640
see if they have any Intel
or resources we could use.

150
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,760
Good idea,
but you shouldn't go alone.

151
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,240
1987 is a long way from 1942,

152
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,000
and it's dangerous to know
too much about the future.

153
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,760
- I can handle myself.
- I'll go with her.

154
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:14,200
Great, you two reach out
to the JSA while the rest of us

155
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,000
break into the most secure
residence in the country.

156
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,040
And how exactly do we do that?

157
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,320
Welcome to the White House.

158
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,120
{\an5}This is Cross Hall,
a magnificent space

159
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,200
that connects the State Dining Room
with the East Room.

160
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,120
All right, fan out, stay on the coms,

161
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,200
and report if anything
seems out of place.

162
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,360
Women actually wore
these things in the '80s?

163
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,480
Shoulder pads?

164
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,440
Yeah, they were supposed
to make women more imposing,

165
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,760
more, I don't know...

166
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,480
- Manly?
- Yeah.

167
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,760
I'd hoped that by this decade,
women wouldn't need to use

168
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,920
clothing to compensate
for their status.

169
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,400
Surely by now men and women
are considered equals.

170
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,280
Never lose that optimism.

171
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,920
This is it.

172
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,040
This is the JSA Academy?

173
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,120
Inside a crummy warehouse?

174
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,720
The JSA Academy is hidden
inside a crummy warehouse.

175
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,880
Prepare to see the most elite
training facility in all of history.

176
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,480
Maybe "elite" means something
different in 1987.

177
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,880
When I was recruited,
this is where I was brought to train.

178
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,640
What happened to the JSA?

179
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,640
No clue...

180
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,760
but a lot can change in 45 years.

181
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,840
I thought you said
you were a historian.

182
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,000
How can you not know?

183
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,640
Hey, every memo,
every executive action

184
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,280
relating to the JSA is top secret.

185
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,800
I only pieced together
their World War II activities

186
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,040
from my father's bedtime stories,

187
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,680
witness testimonies,
and government leaks.

188
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:14,040
I never should have left 1942.

189
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:20,120
Look, Amaya, whatever
happened to them, that's,

190
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,200
that's not your fault.

191
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,640
You don't know that.

192
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,040
Like you said, you don't know
what happened to them.

193
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,800
1987, the halcyon days
of Whitney Houston

194
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,680
and "Star Trek: The Next Generation."

195
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,000
I can remember this year
as if it were yesterday.

196
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,680
Well, it looks like there's
something you forgot about.

197
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,600
Mr. Stein, so nice to meet you.

198
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,600
That's me.

199
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,680
Go, go.

200
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,400
I thought you said
you were stuck in meetings

201
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,760
- on the Hill all day.
- I was.

202
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,320
I never stepped foot
inside the White House.

203
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,880
The aberration must've caused
infinitesimal ripples

204
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,040
that affected the movements
of my younger self.

205
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,600
The temporal domino effect,

206
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,760
this is why we should
never interfere with history.

207
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,680
Well, we'll agree to disagree.

208
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,760
But one thing's for sure,
we cannot let him see you.

209
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,760
Indeed, the last time
he and I interacted

210
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,960
nearly erased our marriage
from existence.

211
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,680
Those are jelly beans.

212
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,080
I can see that.

213
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,840
President Reagan's jelly beans.

214
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,800
So what? Eat them.

215
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,040
What? I'm pretty sure
that's against the rules.

216
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,040
We don't follow rules, remember?

217
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,760
Oh, right.

218
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,280
Reagan wasn't even one
of my top three favorite presidents.

219
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,840
- Want some?
- Yeah.

220
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,200
Oh, it'll take some massaging,

221
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:01,280
but I believe we can get the Soviets
to agree to eliminating all nuclear

222
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,240
ground-launched, ballistic,
and cruise missiles.

223
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,960
I'll even make them believe
it was their idea.

224
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,520
I don't know what we'd do
without you, Mr. Darhk.

225
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,680
Oh, you'd manage,
but winning is always better.

226
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,080
I think we found our aberration.

227
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:17,880
Our next stop is the...

228
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,400
Damien Darhk is here.

229
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,560
<i>Sara, don't do anything rash.</i>

230
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,240
<i>Sara? Sara, are you lis...</i>

231
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,520
Here's another diplomatic cable
from 1956

232
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,040
from the British ambassador
warning the JSA about

233
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,120
Soviet spies in their midst.

234
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,280
I thought fighting Hitler
would unite the U.S.

235
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,720
and the Soviet Union.

236
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,760
Oh, we have so much Cold War
history to catch you up on.

237
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,600
Okay, what's this?

238
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,040
Todd?

239
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,560
Why? Why did you abandon us?

240
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,040
Who is that?

241
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,120
It's Obsidian.

242
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,440
From the JSA?

243
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,360
Soviets to agree to...

244
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:32,600
Ma'am, I'm gonna need you
to drop the weapon.

245
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,040
Drop the knife and place
your hands behind your head.

246
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,920
We've got a situation
in the East Wing.

247
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,040
I know you want vengeance for Laura,
but it's not that simple.

248
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,120
Get out of the way.

249
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,000
Don't move!

250
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,880
- Stay where you are!
- Damn it.

251
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,000
- We gonna fight or leave?
- Fight.

252
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,840
All right, get out of here.

253
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,800
- I got this.
- No, you go. I got this.

254
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,880
I said go!

255
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,800
What did I say
about crossing streams?

256
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,280
You said we don't follow the rules.

257
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,560
That's the one rule,
one rule we follow!

258
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,800
Go!

259
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,000
{\an5}<i>We interrupt this broadcast
with breaking news:</i>

260
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,800
{\an5}<i>Chaos in the capital.
Just a day before</i>

261
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,440
<i>President Reagan is set
to welcome General Secretary</i>

262
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,720
<i>Gorbachev to the White House
to sign the INF Treaty,</i>

263
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,360
<i>a White House tour ends in violence</i>

264
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,680
<i>and what witnesses describe
as "a rocket man."</i>

265
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,880
<i>Was this an act of terrorism...</i>

266
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,120
Please, turn it off, Gideon.

267
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,720
I can't bear it.

268
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,760
So your thirst
for vengeance nearly landed

269
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,240
the entire team in prison.

270
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,840
I guess it's only okay
to change history

271
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,200
if it's with your personal vendetta.

272
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,240
Wasn't all Blondie's fault.

273
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,160
Haircut screwed up as well.

274
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,040
If you would just let me tinker
with the cold gun,

275
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,360
I told you I could figure out

276
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,000
the whole crossing
the streams problem.

277
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,000
There's nothing wrong
with the cold gun.

278
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,040
It's you, you goof.

279
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,400
The bigger question is:

280
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,960
Why did Damien Darhk
become an advisor

281
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,120
to Reagan's White House
on the eve of a nuclear treaty

282
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,200
with the USSR?

283
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,480
If his involvement
with the Nazis in 1942

284
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,920
is any indication, he's working
with our time traveling nemesis.

285
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,360
It's the same person
who killed Hourman.

286
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,760
Amaya needs to hear about this.

287
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,760
So she can also lose focus,

288
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,600
risking everything in a selfish
pursuit of revenge?

289
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:51,120
Do you have something
you'd like to say to me, Martin?

290
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:54,280
Yes, that killing
Damien Darhk almost 30 years

291
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:58,720
before his actual death will have
countless unforeseeable effects

292
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:02,000
on the history that we are charged
with protecting.

293
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:05,120
Well, what about protecting
my sister?

294
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,040
She brought me back from the dead.

295
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,280
She risked everything for me.

296
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,440
How could I not do the same for her?

297
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,800
Because you answer
to a higher calling, Sara.

298
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:22,360
I'm sorry, but we cannot stray
from our guiding principle.

299
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,520
Well, I'm sorry, too.

300
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,680
It sounds like you've never
really cared about anyone.

301
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,760
Do you think I killed him?

302
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,040
I hope I didn't kill him.

303
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,120
He's gotta be in his
late '70s at least.

304
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,560
Maybe he couldn't take the hit.

305
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:43,280
Oh, my God, I just killed a member
of the Justice Society.

306
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,560
Why are you whispering?

307
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,640
In case he's not dead,
he could probably use the nap.

308
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,120
I'm not an invalid...

309
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,400
Just old.

310
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,360
And you, you haven't aged a day.

311
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,880
It's one of the few benefits
of time travel.

312
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,120
So you left us to join
the loveable losers.

313
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,080
I was trying to find Rex's killer.

314
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,880
And you never thought to tell me?

315
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,160
I found Rex dying.

316
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,120
His last words were "time traveler."

317
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,000
I didn't think. I just acted.

318
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,280
What happened to them, Todd?

319
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:20,040
After the war, our friendship
with the Soviet Union ended,

320
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,040
and we continued fighting

321
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:25,040
as what was known
as the "Iron Curtain" descended

322
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,400
over central and eastern Europe.

323
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,720
Does "we" include my grandfather?

324
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,200
Right to the end.

325
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:36,600
In 1956, President Eisenhower
sent a team on a mission to Leipzig.

326
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,520
They never made it back.

327
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,880
Why didn't you go?

328
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,920
'56 was a charged time.

329
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,520
They were concerned
that I couldn't be trusted.

330
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,840
- Why not?
- Leave it be, Nathaniel.

331
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,920
<i>Nate, Amaya,
report back to the Waverider.</i>

332
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,760
I promise you, Todd, I will fix this.

333
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,960
What's done is done, Amaya.

334
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,680
Not when you have a time machine.

335
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm sorry for leaving, Todd.

336
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,480
I truly am.

337
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,000
Rex's killer is here? In 1987?

338
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,600
Potentially, if Damien Darhk
is still working with him.

339
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,480
No way, Damien Darhk
joined the Reagan Administration

340
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,600
as an advisor
at the Reykjavík Summit?

341
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,160
And after the collapse of the summit,

342
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,320
Darhk was credited with reviving
the disarmament talks?

343
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,560
Darhk prefers stockpiling nukes,
not getting rid of them.

344
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,600
The nuclear treaty must be a cover.

345
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,600
- For what purpose?
- That's what we need to find out.

346
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,640
Gideon, where is Damien Darhk now?

347
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,480
<i>I'm accessing the calendar
on his secretary's</i>

348
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,360
<i>IBM personal computer.</i>

349
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,120
<i>Mr. Darhk has a meeting
in Georgetown Park at 8.00pm.</i>

350
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,600
Late night meeting in the park,
that's not suspicious.

351
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:50,360
Ray, take Mick. Find out
who Darhk is meeting with and why.

352
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,440
Wait, just us?

353
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,880
Look, it's not a good idea

354
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,600
for me to be anywhere
near Damien Darhk right now.

355
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,760
I... I agree.

356
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,280
Okay, we're a go on audio.

357
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,160
Cutting it close, haircut.

358
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,640
That's Snart's jacket.

359
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,640
I, thought it would help me
get into character.

360
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,320
I'm Colonel Cold.

361
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,880
The hell you are.

362
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,880
You're not gonna give
yourself a promotion.

363
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,880
Fine.

364
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,760
What are you doing?

365
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,880
Well, we're on a stake-out.

366
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,520
Brought snacks.

367
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,400
Apple slice?

368
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,800
Guess you're still upset
about the White House.

369
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,120
Look, I can be more careful.

370
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,600
I can be more meticulous,
more like Snart.

371
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,560
I don't want you to be like Snart.

372
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,640
What?

373
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,720
You gave me his gun, you told me
I had to try to fill his shoes.

374
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,920
I was wrong.

375
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:59,000
You keep reminding me
of my, my dead friend.

376
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:00,960
It's bringing up...

377
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,000
It's bringing up...

378
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,280
- Feelings?
- Yes.

379
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,680
So just stop and be you.

380
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,080
Well, that's a little difficult,

381
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,600
considering I lost my suit,
my company, my powers.

382
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,600
Is this what an existential
crisis feels like?

383
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,920
Shut up. Just shut up.

384
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,800
<i>Oh, I, I just died
In your arms tonight</i>

385
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,000
I hate the '80s!

386
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,840
Is there any sign of
who Darhk's meeting with?

387
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,920
<i>Not yet!</i>

388
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,640
Clandestine meeting in a D.C. park.

389
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,920
It feels like the beginning
of a John le Carré spy novel.

390
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,600
I'm more of an Ian Fleming guy.

391
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,280
More explosions, less clothing.

392
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,480
What if Darhk is meeting
with Rex's killer?

393
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,760
Then we don't let either
of them leave.

394
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,040
<i>We've got movement.</i>

395
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,240
A man just entered the park.

396
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,600
<i>Ray, we need audio.</i>

397
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,560
Yep, way ahead of you, Cap.

398
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,400
Thankfully, there was
a Tech Village nearby.

399
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,600
You wouldn't believe
what you can hack together

400
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,120
with a few household items.

401
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,920
Dobriy Vecher, Mr. Darhk.

402
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,160
Sounds like he's meeting
with a member

403
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,360
of the Soviet delegation,
not Rex's killer.

404
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,920
The package is procured.

405
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,080
Excellent news, Boris.

406
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,920
That is your name, isn't it?

407
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,240
Boris? Or is it Igor?

408
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,320
<i>I find it's always one
or the other with you KGB agents.</i>

409
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,320
Anyhoo, once the treaty is signed,

410
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,360
during the State Dinner,
you'll deliver the package.

411
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,800
And you will uphold
your half of the bargain?

412
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,800
As agreed.

413
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,360
But first, a toast.

414
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,360
To peace between our two nations.

415
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,400
Darhk was never interested
in the nuclear treaty.

416
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,600
He's working a side deal
with the KGB.

417
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,880
Mayday!

418
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,160
My... My name is Martin Stein.
You must have heard of me.

419
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,360
You may have heard of me.

420
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,480
Marty, younger
you just entered the park.

421
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,400
What? But that... that's impossible.

422
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,600
Today is December 7th,
Clarissa's birthday.

423
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,560
I distinctly remember
we had a dinner reservation

424
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,720
for this evening which
took me months to procure.

425
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,280
Well, you must have blown her off.

426
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,720
This ought to be good.

427
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,800
Should we stop him?

428
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,000
<i>Stop what? What am I doing?</i>

429
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,920
Mr. Darhk allow me
to introduce myself.

430
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,280
My name is Martin Stein.
You may have heard of me.

431
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,680
I'm on the negotiating team
and was recently nominated

432
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,160
for my sixth Carlin Award in physics.

433
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,480
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

434
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,280
- Did you follow me here?
- I did.

435
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,040
<i>You see, I'm... I'm working on
a transmutation project that</i>

436
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,080
<i>is vital to national security.</i>

437
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,840
I was hoping you might pass
the proposal on to the President.

438
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,800
Excuse me, I can't help
but notice you're wearing

439
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,840
a Komandirskie watch,
typically supplied to

440
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,760
the Soviet Ministry of Defense.

441
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,480
Meeting with a Soviet outside

442
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,000
of the official negotiation schedule?

443
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,240
That is highly irregular.

444
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,680
Ray, Mick, get in there, now.

445
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:06,840
Okay.

446
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,720
Clearly, there's been some
kind of misunderstanding.

447
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,640
I'll just leave
and pretend these last

448
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,920
five minutes didn't happen.

449
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,240
Unfortunately, my imagination
isn't quite that vivid.

450
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,040
- Gray!
- Martin!

451
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,800
Ray, what happened?

452
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,720
<i>Darhk just stabbed
Marty's younger self.</i>

453
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,120
Where's Darhk?

454
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,200
We lost him.

455
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,840
It's gonna be okay.
I'm gonna get you back.

456
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,720
Where is he?

457
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,320
He's on his way now.

458
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,240
Don't worry, you're gonna be fine.

459
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,560
You again?

460
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,280
I mean, me again.

461
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,760
Guess you figured it out.

462
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,840
How did this happen?

463
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,840
I'm too young to die.

464
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,560
Too brilliant to die.

465
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,120
Will one of you please shut me up?

466
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,360
Gladly.

467
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,440
Gideon?

468
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,400
<i>I'm cauterizing
the younger Martin's wound.</i>

469
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,600
<i>I'm afraid it will leave both
patients with a rather nasty scar.</i>

470
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,120
You should've let me punch him.

471
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,720
This is about time travel, isn't it?

472
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,720
That's why Special Advisor Darhk
stabbed me.

473
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,480
He wouldn't have stabbed you
if you had been having dinner

474
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,520
with Clarissa at L'Auberge
as previously planned.

475
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,800
Good God, Clarissa.

476
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,160
She's waiting for me at the hotel.

477
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,440
How could you have left her
alone on her birthday?

478
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,720
She ordered room service.

479
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,400
You are a careless,
self-centered idiot.

480
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,040
Gray, Gray,
look, I'll go to the hotel,

481
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,240
and I'll tell Clarissa
that her husband's working late.

482
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,640
Okay? Just relax.

483
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,880
Oh, oh, Martin, what on Earth
were you thinking?

484
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,120
Hubba-hubba, who's that?

485
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,920
Professor Stein's wife.

486
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,360
Jax is at her hotel
explaining why she has to

487
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,400
spend her birthday alone.

488
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,480
Wait a minute, if he used everyone's

489
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,600
favorite talking computer
to find her...

490
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,920
Gideon, do you have
the location on Damien Darhk?

491
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,760
<i>Unfortunately, I have no Intel</i>

492
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,280
<i>on his current whereabouts.</i>

493
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,720
But we know where he's gonna be.

494
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,040
His little side deal
with the Soviets is going down

495
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,120
at the State Dinner tomorrow night.

496
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,920
<i>Which is probably
the most heavily guarded</i>

497
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,120
<i>dinner in history.</i>

498
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,360
I think we know someone
who may be able to help.

499
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,440
<i>Is that so?</i>

500
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,960
One of Amaya's old JSA buddies,
and, by old, I mean old.

501
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,520
He may still have
some government contacts

502
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,640
we can exploit.

503
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,880
Absolutely not.

504
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,280
Whatever Darhk is planning
to exchange with the Soviets,

505
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,400
it can't be good.

506
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,600
Well, I'll contact the FBI.

507
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,120
You don't have to worry about it.

508
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,320
Except we do.

509
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,080
Darhk's working with a time traveler.

510
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,760
That's way
out of the Bureau's league.

511
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,920
I believe
this time traveler killed Rex.

512
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,280
All the more reason to stay
clear of that State Dinner.

513
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,240
You can't remain professional.

514
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,080
Are you kidding me?
She's nothing but professional.

515
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,840
She's all about being professional.

516
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,760
The only reason I could ever see
her not being...

517
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,760
Oh, my God, you
and Rex Tyler were together.

518
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,840
- No.
- They were together, weren't they?

519
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,320
This makes total sense.

520
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,640
We weren't together.

521
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,600
Like I said before,
fraternization among

522
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,040
teammates is unprofessional.

523
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,880
Rex and I were going to leave
the JSA after the war,

524
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,560
try and start a new life
with each other.

525
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,760
And then he was cut down.

526
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:18,360
That's why I left the team,
and that's why I wouldn't

527
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,440
talk to you about them.

528
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,680
It's too hard.

529
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,720
And this is why
I'm reluctant to help you.

530
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,000
Because your emotions
are clouding your judgment.

531
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,160
She won't be facing Darhk alone.

532
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,080
We need your help.

533
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,680
I know you feel like I abandoned you,

534
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,960
but, please, don't abandon me.

535
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,320
Hey, how you doing?

536
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,080
I'm all right.

537
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,960
You know, the truth is,

538
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,960
this young man
is like a stranger to me.

539
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,200
Every time I encounter him,
I can't imagine

540
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,160
I was ever that person.

541
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,280
I think anyone would feel
that way about meeting

542
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,360
their younger self.

543
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,840
I don't recognize my current self.

544
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,080
Mick told me
I need to be more like me.

545
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,560
And he's right, which is rare.

546
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,280
Indeed.

547
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,840
The problem is I don't know
what being me means right now.

548
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,640
I don't know if that makes any sense.

549
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,120
Of course it does.

550
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,680
I think everyone struggles
at least on occasion

551
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,520
with who they are
and then what their place is

552
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,760
in the world.

553
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,960
So what's the answer?

554
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,720
I have no idea.

555
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,800
But, I suppose it's just to live.

556
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,040
It's all any of us can really do.

557
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,160
And then, hopefully,
through the act of living

558
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,600
we discover who we truly are

559
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:40,680
and learn to grow from that.

560
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,560
Amaya got us invites
to the State Dinner.

561
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,240
Are you feeling up to it?

562
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,360
Yes, I'm feeling much better.

563
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,960
You feeling up to it?

564
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,920
I think what he means is
are you gonna create

565
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,120
a diplomatic crisis
and risk unknown damage

566
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,800
to history by killing Damien Darhk?

567
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,440
I know what he means, Ray.

568
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:05,760
Earlier, you accused me
of not ever caring for anyone,

569
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,840
but you know that's not true.

570
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,520
I care very much about you.

571
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,320
And I'm less concerned about history

572
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,840
than I am about your conscience.

573
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,400
You're no longer an assassin, Sara.

574
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,600
You're our Captain.

575
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,440
Well, let's hope I remember
that when the time comes.

576
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:27,920
Now let's do this.

577
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,400
<i>Revving up your engine</i>

578
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,120
Thank you for helping us get in.

579
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,960
Feels good to be back in the game.

580
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,680
I don't see Damien Darhk anywhere.

581
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,800
He'll be here.

582
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,960
Oh, my God, what is she doing here?

583
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,720
Probably looking
for her husband, no doubt.

584
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:08,080
She's... she's coming this way,
what... what should I do?

585
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,520
Just... Just talk to her.

586
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,360
Mr. Jackson, I expected
to meet my husband here.

587
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,520
Have you seen him yet?

588
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,640
I'm sorry, no. I haven't.

589
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,880
I'd be worried,
but it's just like Martin

590
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,520
to lose track of time.

591
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,480
Well, I'm sure, wherever he is,

592
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,600
you are foremost in his mind.

593
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,400
Who are you?

594
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,200
I'm... I'm a colleague of his.

595
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,200
My name is also Martin.

596
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,240
He never mentioned you.

597
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:36,080
Well, I'm sure he has more
important things to talk about.

598
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,520
Oh, would you...
would you care to dance?

599
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:43,840
I never seem to take the time
to enjoy these State Dinners.

600
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,920
Sure.

601
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,560
You all right?

602
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,680
You seem tense.

603
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,520
When you find Rex's killer,
what are you gonna do to him?

604
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,600
Arrest him.

605
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,800
What else is there?

606
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,080
You could kill him.

607
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,960
I'm a member of the Justice Society,

608
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,840
or at least I was when it existed,

609
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,760
I'm not some vigilante.

610
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:16,920
I'm sorry, I don't mean to pry,
but you don't

611
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,080
seem too happy to be here.

612
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,240
It's just... Martin invited me
on this trip for my birthday,

613
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,280
and I've spent the better
part of it alone.

614
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,120
Perhaps you should talk to him.

615
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:31,640
I've tried, but Martin's
love for nuclear science...

616
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,000
it's irrepressible.

617
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,080
Sometimes my husband
has tunnel vision.

618
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:40,920
Well, Martin is a fool,
but, believe me, he loves you.

619
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,000
You're far more important to him than

620
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,280
any of his scientific achievements.

621
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:52,680
I have the strangest feeling,
like we've danced before.

622
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,840
Sara, Darhk's in the hallway.

623
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,080
Mick, Ray, guard the exits.

624
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,440
And everybody else,

625
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,600
get ready to move.

626
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:15,040
Now that our governments
are waging peace upstairs,

627
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,200
what do you say we get down
to the real business?

628
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,040
You have brought us the codes?

629
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,760
It's called a CD-ROM, the latest

630
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,440
in Defense Department technology.

631
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,400
As for my half of the exchange?

632
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,600
Hand over the box.

633
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,080
And the kick-ass CD-ROM.

634
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,640
What is this?

635
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,400
He thinks we're working with Darhk.

636
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,480
Never.

637
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,000
No one has to get hurt.

638
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,280
That's not really my style.

639
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,920
Now, we can waste time chit-chatting,

640
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,960
or you can deal
with the explosive my people

641
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,160
have secreted inside
the State Dining Room.

642
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,760
See, in about six minutes,
Reagan, Gorbachev,

643
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,640
and every hope of peace goes kaboom.

644
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,760
- Ray?
<i>- We're on it.</i>

645
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,160
I am sorry... inconvenient,
I know, but try being me.

646
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,640
Todd?

647
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,560
<i>We're on the move to find the bomb.</i>

648
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,520
The bomb we must save Clarissa.

649
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:57,760
I got this, Sara. Go stop Darhk.

650
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,640
That's cool, man.

651
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,040
Mary Todd's hope chest.

652
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,120
Oh, you have gone too far!

653
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,320
Everyone.

654
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,400
Get the hell out of here, right now.

655
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,040
Now that we have your attention,

656
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,360
would you all please leave
the dining room immediately?

657
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,840
We believe there's
a bomb on the premises.

658
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,040
- You okay?
- Who are you?

659
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,920
A friend of your husband's.

660
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,760
Good news, I found the bomb.

661
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,800
Bad news, this type of firing
system is obsolete.

662
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,880
I have no idea how to
disarm such a crude weapon.

663
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,000
Figure it out, Ray.

664
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,360
I'm a little busy.

665
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,480
There's nothing I can do.

666
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,560
Yes, there is.

667
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,560
I was wrong trying to make
you like Snart.

668
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,000
You're Ray Palmer...

669
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,960
you can science your way
out of anything.

670
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,000
I'm Ray Palmer. I'm Ray Palmer.

671
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,560
I can science my way
out of anything.

672
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,360
I...

673
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,680
If I can send an electrical
pulse from an outside

674
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,880
power source,
I might be able to overload

675
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,600
the bomb's incendiary trigger,

676
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,720
but I'd have to dismantle
to cold gun.

677
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,240
Less talking, more doing.

678
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,360
No!

679
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:16,920
Ray?

680
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,600
<i>- Tell me the bomb's disarmed.</i>
- That would be a lie.

681
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,680
Well, ten seconds to live.

682
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,160
There are worse ways of dying.

683
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,480
I did it.

684
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,560
- I did it.
- Good.

685
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,400
Hold on, Todd.

686
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,360
Okay? Just hold on.

687
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,400
You and I have met before.

688
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,680
New York City, 1942.
You haven't aged a bit.

689
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,240
Lazarus Pit?

690
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,160
Oh, woman of mystery.

691
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,440
I know that look in your eye, though.

692
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,880
That's the look of someone
that I've taken everything from.

693
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,720
Not everything.

694
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,400
You haven't taken my soul,

695
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,240
which I've already lost,
and I'm not eager to do again.

696
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:22,080
And that's why I'm sparing your life.

697
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,800
How merciful of you.

698
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,960
I'm sparing you
to prolong your suffering.

699
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,800
'Cause I'm from the future,
Damien, and I know

700
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,160
how this all ends.

701
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,280
Your ark, your grand vision.

702
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,000
Just as you're about to accomplish

703
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:41,760
everything you desire,

704
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:46,560
your wife is murdered,
the love of your life.

705
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,000
And in total despair,

706
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,800
you even try to kill
your own daughter.

707
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,360
An entire city rises up against you,

708
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,680
and then you die...

709
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:03,680
defeated and alone.

710
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,600
What happened?

711
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,680
Where's Darhk?

712
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,160
He took him.

713
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,120
The time traveler
working against us...

714
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,720
He's a speedster.

715
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,800
Like the Flash?

716
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,600
Faster.

717
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,000
So the speedster and Darhk,
they have whatever

718
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,480
the KGB gave Darhk?

719
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,560
Unless...

720
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,080
Unless?

721
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,520
I swiped it off Darhk.

722
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,800
Shut up.

723
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,120
Can I hug you?

724
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,240
Do we hug?

725
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,320
- Okay, just this once.
- There's gonna be more.

726
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,800
Yeah!

727
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,480
You took a bullet for me.

728
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,600
For a fellow member
of the JSA, it was nothing.

729
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,720
Astonishing to be back here again.

730
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:01,120
A ship that can travel through
time and heal any wound.

731
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,520
Think of the possibilities...

732
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,600
Let me remind you,

733
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,720
it's imperative that you
carry on as if you never

734
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,920
saw me or anything else
from the future.

735
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,720
That you would pass up
the chance to show me

736
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,040
even the barest glimpse
of that future,

737
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:16,680
catapulting our transmutation
research into the 21st century,

738
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,440
I had no idea
I could ever be so selfish.

739
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,520
Interesting, considering
that's exactly

740
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,840
how you've been to Clarissa.

741
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,440
She nearly died last night

742
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,800
because of your blind devotion
to your work.

743
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,920
You of all people understand
the importance of our research.

744
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,480
I understand the importance
of one thing and one thing only.

745
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,200
After everything
I've accomplished, all...

746
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,360
all of the awards I've won...

747
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,480
Did we win the sixth Carlin?

748
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:50,560
The only thing that brings
meaning to my life is Clarissa.

749
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,160
Yes, Martin, our wife, who you spent

750
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:58,080
the last two days ignoring.

751
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,680
But I love Clarissa.

752
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:02,440
Then cherish her, Martin,

753
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,080
because I promise you,

754
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:11,080
she is the only thing
you will care to remember.

755
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:13,720
And I promise you...

756
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,800
I'll make sure she knows I love her.

757
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,240
I pray that you do.

758
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,720
Are you sure you won't come with us?

759
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,840
Rex's killer is still out there.

760
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,320
We could find him together.

761
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:44,400
I think last night proved
my fighting days are over.

762
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,640
You were amazing out there.

763
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,680
It felt like old times.

764
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,920
But there's something keeping
you here in 1987, isn't there?

765
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:58,720
After the JSA disbanded,
I spent a lot of lonely years

766
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,280
until I finally met someone, Amaya.

767
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,160
And he's waiting for me at home.

768
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,320
<i>I have ameliorated
Mr. Rice's injuries.</i>

769
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,920
That's incredible. Wow.

770
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:19,160
A word of advice from an old man
who's lived long enough

771
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,800
to see the world change,
and mostly for the better.

772
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,400
If you are lucky enough
to find love again...

773
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,360
Embrace it.

774
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,320
Are you leaving already?

775
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,160
I was hoping we'd have a beer.

776
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:38,560
Oh, unlike you, my time is limited,

777
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,800
and I don't need the carbs.

778
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,360
Good-bye, Todd.

779
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,160
Well, I guess I just...

780
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,520
He loved to sing.

781
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,320
Henry, your grandfather.

782
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,440
He had a beautiful voice.

783
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,480
During long convoys or stake-outs,

784
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,520
he would serenade the team.

785
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,520
He made it his personal mission
to get me to sing along,

786
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,760
but he never succeeded.

787
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,680
But when the chips were down

788
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:26,040
and all hope seemed lost,

789
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,760
we could always count on
Henry to lift our spirits.

790
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,360
That's the kind of man
your grandfather was.

791
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,080
Then take me back there now.

792
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,280
I will get your item back for you.

793
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,520
The Legends have left 1987.

794
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,080
The item is beyond your reach.

795
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,160
That blonde woman...

796
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,680
She's a time traveler like you.

797
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,280
She knows what happens
to me in the future.

798
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,640
- I'm sure she does.
