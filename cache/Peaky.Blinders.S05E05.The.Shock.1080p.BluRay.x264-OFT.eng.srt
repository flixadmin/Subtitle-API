1
00:00:02,685 --> 00:00:04,685
<i>My name is Brilliant Chang.</i>

2
00:00:04,805 --> 00:00:06,205
Mr Thomas...

3
00:00:08,285 --> 00:00:12,205
...it is the purest opium
that has ever arrived in Europe.

4
00:00:12,325 --> 00:00:16,125
Came off a ship called the <i>Capital,</i>
out of Shanghai.

5
00:00:16,245 --> 00:00:17,965
This is a gift, Mr Shelby.

6
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:21,845
Canals are the idea, right, Chang?

7
00:00:21,965 --> 00:00:25,645
I believe we've friends in common.
We should postpone our war.

8
00:00:25,765 --> 00:00:29,005
Your message said you wanted to seal
our truce with some business.

9
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:32,245
I'm involved in a transaction
with Jimmy McCavern.

10
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:35,045
I need your signature as a guarantor
on the transaction

11
00:00:35,165 --> 00:00:38,325
should his cheque fail to be honoured.

12
00:00:38,445 --> 00:00:41,365
The war with the Billy Boys is postponed.
We've made peace.

13
00:00:41,485 --> 00:00:42,965
We're gonna do business together.

14
00:00:44,685 --> 00:00:46,725
<i>There's a part of me
that is unfamiliar to myself</i>

15
00:00:46,845 --> 00:00:49,725
<i>and I keep finding myself there.</i>

16
00:00:49,845 --> 00:00:52,485
<i>And only the</i> January
<i>can get me away.</i>

17
00:00:58,165 --> 00:01:02,565
His name was Frederick.
All we ever did was talk, Arthur.

18
00:01:02,685 --> 00:01:05,965
He just listened.
And now he has no face.

19
00:01:08,005 --> 00:01:09,925
May you Peaky Blinders all rot...

20
00:01:21,685 --> 00:01:23,565
- Clear that shit. Clear it!
- All right.

21
00:01:23,685 --> 00:01:24,925
Take her.

22
00:01:38,925 --> 00:01:42,325
Go outside. Till it's done.
Till it's done, brother.

23
00:01:47,405 --> 00:01:50,245
Linda, I would have taken your bullet.

24
00:01:51,325 --> 00:01:52,805
I deserved the bullet.

25
00:01:52,925 --> 00:01:55,525
An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth!

26
00:01:57,605 --> 00:01:58,645
Linda!

27
00:01:58,765 --> 00:01:59,965
Linda, look at me.

28
00:02:00,085 --> 00:02:01,645
Linda, you've got a kid.

29
00:02:01,765 --> 00:02:04,445
If you die, he'll come to us to raise.

30
00:02:04,565 --> 00:02:05,805
You hear me?

31
00:02:07,365 --> 00:02:09,005
I used a derringer.

32
00:02:09,125 --> 00:02:10,725
- Shh!
- Right.

33
00:02:10,845 --> 00:02:11,965
- Shh!
- It's still in there.

34
00:02:12,085 --> 00:02:13,485
It's above the bone.

35
00:02:13,605 --> 00:02:15,245
Mr Shelby, your guests.

36
00:02:15,365 --> 00:02:16,605
Get him out. Arthur!

37
00:02:16,725 --> 00:02:19,085
Family only. Get him out!

38
00:02:20,805 --> 00:02:22,605
- Mr Shelby...
- Get out!

39
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,445
Get out!

40
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:30,045
Lizzie, go to the kitchen
and get some iodine. Now! Go!

41
00:02:32,005 --> 00:02:34,605
Shh...

42
00:02:35,765 --> 00:02:37,005
Linda...

43
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:38,605
You'll have to bite on this.

44
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:41,125
- Linda... Arthur.
- Bite! Come here.

45
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:43,325
Now, it's really gonna hurt.

46
00:02:45,085 --> 00:02:46,605
One, two, three...

47
00:02:54,645 --> 00:02:56,285
You're all right. You're all right.

48
00:02:56,405 --> 00:02:58,645
- It's all over.
- Hold her.

49
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:10,245
Is she going to be all right, Tom?
Is she going to be all right, Tom?

50
00:03:10,365 --> 00:03:11,445
Yeah.

51
00:03:11,565 --> 00:03:12,845
Oh, Jesus.

52
00:03:12,965 --> 00:03:14,285
Arthur, come here. Come here.

53
00:03:14,405 --> 00:03:17,525
If you love her, go to the library,
get some opium.

54
00:03:17,645 --> 00:03:20,045
- Go on. She'll be fine. Go sort it.
- Right.

55
00:03:25,565 --> 00:03:28,445
Actually, you can use mine.

56
00:03:33,165 --> 00:03:36,885
Brought a bit to celebrate
the wedding proposal.

57
00:03:38,165 --> 00:03:39,965
Oh! He proposed, eh?

58
00:03:42,365 --> 00:03:43,685
One knee.

59
00:03:45,205 --> 00:03:47,525
Congratulations, Poll.

60
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:48,645
Linda...

61
00:03:48,725 --> 00:03:50,205
Linda...

62
00:03:50,325 --> 00:03:52,005
- You're gonna have to drink this.
- No.

63
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,605
I don't want anything you've touched.

64
00:03:53,685 --> 00:03:56,805
25 seconds. 25 seconds
and the pain will be gone.

65
00:03:56,925 --> 00:03:58,805
Even the pain in your head.

66
00:03:58,925 --> 00:04:00,405
Right, here you go. Drink.

67
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,445
Cushion, Poll.

68
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,445
Right.

69
00:04:18,845 --> 00:04:20,285
Oh, Jesus Christ...

70
00:04:20,405 --> 00:04:22,205
Arthur...

71
00:04:23,285 --> 00:04:24,845
She's gonna be fine.

72
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:27,925
I gave her something
to get her to sleep.

73
00:04:28,045 --> 00:04:29,325
She's gonna be fine.

74
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:36,005
You should have... You should have
let her do it, Poll.

75
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,165
You should have let her do it.

76
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:40,765
Arthur...

77
00:04:42,045 --> 00:04:43,565
You should have let her do it.

78
00:04:43,685 --> 00:04:45,405
Look at me, brother! Look at me!

79
00:04:45,525 --> 00:04:47,365
You've got things to do.

80
00:04:47,485 --> 00:04:48,965
You've got a kid.

81
00:04:49,085 --> 00:04:50,925
- Yeah.
- We need you!

82
00:04:51,045 --> 00:04:53,285
- All right? You understand?
- Yeah.

83
00:04:53,405 --> 00:04:55,965
Aberama wants you as best man.

84
00:04:56,085 --> 00:04:57,205
You hear that?

85
00:05:00,805 --> 00:05:03,165
I save his life, he hugs him.

86
00:05:06,165 --> 00:05:07,285
Oh...

87
00:05:08,485 --> 00:05:10,005
I'll do it.

88
00:05:10,125 --> 00:05:11,445
No take.

89
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,645
Right, fine. Let him be. Let him be.

90
00:05:24,245 --> 00:05:26,045
Ladies and gentlemen...

91
00:05:27,925 --> 00:05:29,085
Ladies and gentlemen...

92
00:05:30,525 --> 00:05:34,605
...I would like to extend our gratitude
to the musicians

93
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:37,765
and the dance company
for your wonderful performance.

94
00:05:37,885 --> 00:05:38,885
Hear hear!

95
00:05:38,965 --> 00:05:42,685
This has been a wonderful evening.

96
00:05:44,245 --> 00:05:47,365
And not only
for the music and the dancing.

97
00:05:47,485 --> 00:05:51,285
It has also been about us,
the people gathered here.

98
00:05:52,645 --> 00:05:55,565
English people
in the very heart of England.

99
00:05:57,245 --> 00:06:00,005
There are no people
I would rather be among,

100
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:04,485
no place I would rather be
and no time I would rather be alive,

101
00:06:04,605 --> 00:06:07,405
because ever since
the terrible events of October,

102
00:06:07,525 --> 00:06:09,765
when the money markets betrayed us all...

103
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:15,085
...I have known that change is coming.

104
00:06:17,405 --> 00:06:22,805
The human species has never faced
such immense possibilities,

105
00:06:22,925 --> 00:06:24,125
such choices.

106
00:06:25,565 --> 00:06:27,285
In the lives of great nations...

107
00:06:29,325 --> 00:06:31,445
...there are moments of destiny...

108
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:37,125
...which have swept aside
small men of convention

109
00:06:37,245 --> 00:06:39,325
and discovered men of the moment.

110
00:06:39,445 --> 00:06:44,085
- Hear hear!
- And our host is such a man.

111
00:06:45,925 --> 00:06:47,565
For him...

112
00:06:47,685 --> 00:06:52,325
For him, the little calculations
of little men mean nothing.

113
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:58,165
He is a man well suited to
the mighty mood that England is now in.

114
00:07:00,245 --> 00:07:03,285
The only reason I say this now,

115
00:07:03,405 --> 00:07:06,485
at this moment, on this stage,

116
00:07:06,605 --> 00:07:09,885
is because I have some news.

117
00:07:10,005 --> 00:07:12,325
Good news, I think.

118
00:07:15,165 --> 00:07:18,045
I'm sure our host will forgive me
if I use this platform,

119
00:07:18,165 --> 00:07:23,125
this gathering of friends and like minds,
to give you, his trusted allies,

120
00:07:23,245 --> 00:07:25,885
an early announcement
of a long-overdue event.

121
00:07:27,445 --> 00:07:29,445
I want to tell you good folk first...

122
00:07:30,965 --> 00:07:33,085
...that with the dawn of a new decade...

123
00:07:34,645 --> 00:07:37,085
...I will be setting a new course.

124
00:07:37,205 --> 00:07:42,605
Setting up a new political movement
here in the very heart of England.

125
00:07:42,725 --> 00:07:45,245
And Mr Shelby will be with me,

126
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:46,965
shoulder to shoulder.

127
00:07:47,085 --> 00:07:48,645
Hear hear!

128
00:07:50,765 --> 00:07:54,525
It will offer
a new conception of politics

129
00:07:54,645 --> 00:07:56,685
in which the great character
of the British,

130
00:07:56,805 --> 00:07:59,125
our true character,

131
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:01,405
will be reborn.

132
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:11,925
Many of you lost fortunes
in the recent stock market crash.

133
00:08:12,045 --> 00:08:14,485
The men of money,

134
00:08:14,605 --> 00:08:16,965
the capitalists in New York,

135
00:08:17,085 --> 00:08:18,725
the Jews...

136
00:08:19,925 --> 00:08:22,925
...the money-power, they...they run
an international system

137
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:24,845
in which the infinite mobility of money,

138
00:08:24,965 --> 00:08:28,685
its capacity to create financial chaos
and panic,

139
00:08:28,805 --> 00:08:33,685
can bring down any government
that dares for one moment to oppose it.

140
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:40,085
For generations,
the efforts of hard-working men like you

141
00:08:40,205 --> 00:08:43,445
have equipped our competitors against us.

142
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:45,085
The cotton mills of India.

143
00:08:45,205 --> 00:08:46,805
The cotton mills of Asia.

144
00:08:46,925 --> 00:08:48,885
Created with British money

145
00:08:49,005 --> 00:08:52,525
but used for the destruction
of Lancashire and Yorkshire!

146
00:08:52,645 --> 00:08:54,085
Disgraceful!

147
00:08:54,205 --> 00:08:59,005
The usurers of New York,
the sweated labour of the Orient

148
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:03,085
combining to destroy
the iron and steel factories

149
00:09:03,205 --> 00:09:05,405
of Warwickshire and Staffordshire.

150
00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:09,565
These are policies that could not
be pursued by British statesmen

151
00:09:09,685 --> 00:09:14,205
unless they were mad
or the servants of Jewish finance!

152
00:09:16,205 --> 00:09:19,445
<i>They are</i> the ones who took your money,

153
00:09:19,565 --> 00:09:21,805
but it is I and those who know this truth

154
00:09:21,925 --> 00:09:26,525
who will light a flame
the atheists cannot extinguish!

155
00:09:36,685 --> 00:09:39,485
The ranks of our heroes
of the Great War

156
00:09:39,605 --> 00:09:43,885
have been betrayed
again and again by politicians!

157
00:09:44,005 --> 00:09:49,765
But hear this - those of you who fought
the Jew war for nothing,

158
00:09:49,885 --> 00:09:52,005
you brave men,

159
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:55,365
you will join hands
with the angry youth of Birmingham

160
00:09:55,485 --> 00:09:58,285
and Manchester and London
and Liverpool

161
00:09:58,405 --> 00:10:02,325
and declare that England lives tonight

162
00:10:02,445 --> 00:10:04,645
and marches on!

163
00:10:05,845 --> 00:10:06,845
Well said!

164
00:10:06,965 --> 00:10:09,645
I say all this to you now...

165
00:10:10,765 --> 00:10:12,605
...because I believe
it is in places like this,

166
00:10:12,685 --> 00:10:17,405
with people like you, that we will have
to pass on our message directly.

167
00:10:17,525 --> 00:10:20,325
Our message can be summarised
with these words -

168
00:10:20,445 --> 00:10:22,525
Britain first.

169
00:10:28,605 --> 00:10:31,045
And because this is our message,

170
00:10:31,165 --> 00:10:33,525
I doubt it'll be reported
fairly in the press.

171
00:10:33,645 --> 00:10:37,045
I'm afraid the newspapers of this country

172
00:10:37,165 --> 00:10:42,125
are owned by the same vested interests
who took your money.

173
00:10:43,605 --> 00:10:45,925
They sell to the people false news...

174
00:10:46,045 --> 00:10:48,925
...to raise the interests of the faction
and the section

175
00:10:49,045 --> 00:10:51,125
above the interests of the nation.

176
00:10:51,245 --> 00:10:54,085
- Good man!
- So hear my words

177
00:10:54,205 --> 00:10:57,725
and pass them on
to those with ears to hear.

178
00:10:57,845 --> 00:11:01,805
And be reminded
that when the new decade begins,

179
00:11:01,925 --> 00:11:05,725
there will be the birth
of a new political party

180
00:11:05,845 --> 00:11:07,725
which will speak for you.

181
00:11:09,765 --> 00:11:11,165
Well said, sir.

182
00:11:11,285 --> 00:11:12,365
Well said!

183
00:11:12,485 --> 00:11:16,725
This party, this new movement,
this revolution...

184
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:22,685
...will be called
the British Union of Fascists.

185
00:11:22,805 --> 00:11:24,205
Bravo!

186
00:11:37,045 --> 00:11:38,365
Good man!

187
00:11:38,485 --> 00:11:42,005
What the fuck are you doing,
dealing with a man like that, Tommy?

188
00:11:42,125 --> 00:11:44,965
Yep.
You're going to have to trust me.

189
00:11:45,085 --> 00:11:46,365
Again.

190
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:56,125
I'm going to fuck the swan.

191
00:11:58,085 --> 00:12:00,685
Somebody go and tell her
to come to my room.

192
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:02,445
How do you know she'll come?

193
00:12:04,845 --> 00:12:06,525
Because they always do.

194
00:12:17,885 --> 00:12:19,645
Now, forgive me.

195
00:12:19,765 --> 00:12:21,965
I'm going to borrow your husband
for a little while.

196
00:12:23,765 --> 00:12:25,085
This way.

197
00:12:28,645 --> 00:12:33,925
Things like tonight, that shooting,
a family dispute in public,

198
00:12:34,045 --> 00:12:36,445
things like that will have to stop.

199
00:12:36,565 --> 00:12:38,285
It's very lower class.

200
00:12:38,405 --> 00:12:40,725
It's all been cleared up, Mr Mosley.

201
00:12:50,285 --> 00:12:53,045
So, did you learn anything
from my speech tonight?

202
00:12:53,165 --> 00:12:54,885
Yes.

203
00:12:55,005 --> 00:12:56,405
Yes, I learned many things.

204
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:59,725
Religion was a beast,
but it's dead.

205
00:13:00,925 --> 00:13:03,285
You have to ride the new thing
when it comes.

206
00:13:03,405 --> 00:13:05,045
Like a horse.

207
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:07,325
You grab it.

208
00:13:09,405 --> 00:13:12,285
I looked into the audience
and I saw medals

209
00:13:12,405 --> 00:13:14,365
and Savile Row suits,

210
00:13:14,485 --> 00:13:15,765
and bitterness.

211
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:20,645
<i>They are</i> my people.
Your people will be different.

212
00:13:23,965 --> 00:13:26,325
Oh, do see the funny side, Shelby.

213
00:13:28,205 --> 00:13:29,565
I do.

214
00:13:31,485 --> 00:13:33,245
I do see the funny side.

215
00:13:39,965 --> 00:13:41,725
Do you enjoy strategies?

216
00:13:41,845 --> 00:13:44,085
Yes, I do.

217
00:13:44,205 --> 00:13:46,485
Things will begin to happen now.

218
00:13:46,605 --> 00:13:47,805
So...

219
00:13:49,165 --> 00:13:51,725
...there are some things
we need to discuss.

220
00:13:51,845 --> 00:13:54,405
I've been looking
into your companies.

221
00:13:54,525 --> 00:13:58,205
The Shelby portfolio.

222
00:13:58,325 --> 00:14:00,765
Your company lawyer is a Jew.

223
00:14:00,885 --> 00:14:02,445
He will have to go.

224
00:14:04,645 --> 00:14:06,325
Of course.

225
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:08,805
Also, our friend Jimmy McCavern

226
00:14:08,925 --> 00:14:13,805
has asked for control of the racecourses
north of Wincanton.

227
00:14:13,925 --> 00:14:16,845
I decided it is a trifling thing,
considering our new enterprise,

228
00:14:16,965 --> 00:14:20,165
so I said yes.

229
00:14:22,765 --> 00:14:25,045
In return for what?

230
00:14:25,165 --> 00:14:26,925
No return.

231
00:14:30,205 --> 00:14:31,565
None.

232
00:14:34,085 --> 00:14:38,485
When our campaign begins, the country
will be divided into distinct areas.

233
00:14:38,605 --> 00:14:41,685
McCavern and his men
will be our soldiers in the north,

234
00:14:41,805 --> 00:14:44,165
controlling rallies
and breaking up demonstrations.

235
00:14:44,285 --> 00:14:47,405
In the Midlands, it'll be you.

236
00:14:47,525 --> 00:14:52,085
The south... Well, I have yet to decide.

237
00:14:54,725 --> 00:14:58,365
Please understand what I'm offering you
as we go forward, Mr Shelby.

238
00:14:58,485 --> 00:15:02,805
When we succeed,
even the King will not be above us.

239
00:15:10,045 --> 00:15:11,285
Power.

240
00:15:12,365 --> 00:15:14,365
Like plugging into the mains.

241
00:15:15,845 --> 00:15:17,445
A lighthouse beam.

242
00:15:18,565 --> 00:15:21,445
Your millions of dollars
safe in Switzerland,

243
00:15:21,565 --> 00:15:25,165
and access to every dirty-minded swan
in England.

244
00:15:31,365 --> 00:15:35,405
Oh, and also, Shelby... drink less.

245
00:16:21,445 --> 00:16:23,165
Put it on.

246
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:28,405
Put the costume back on.

247
00:17:00,045 --> 00:17:03,365
The ballerina and I were wondering
whether perhaps...

248
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,445
...you might want to join us.

249
00:17:06,565 --> 00:17:08,925
If I told Tommy,
you wouldn't see the morning.

250
00:17:09,045 --> 00:17:11,045
Oh, I doubt that very much.

251
00:17:12,085 --> 00:17:15,525
You see, he is being seduced,
just as you were.

252
00:17:30,765 --> 00:17:31,805
Tommy.

253
00:17:33,805 --> 00:17:35,365
Tommy!

254
00:17:36,645 --> 00:17:38,725
- Tom!
- What?

255
00:17:39,805 --> 00:17:41,965
Lizzie... What?!

256
00:17:44,925 --> 00:17:46,605
Tommy, I swear to God, you're bad.

257
00:17:46,725 --> 00:17:48,885
That man is fucking evil.

258
00:17:49,005 --> 00:17:50,205
Lizzie...

259
00:17:51,965 --> 00:17:53,565
I'm only doing this...

260
00:17:53,685 --> 00:17:55,365
...to bring the bastard down.

261
00:17:55,485 --> 00:17:57,925
Yeah, but why?

262
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,245
Tommy? Why?

263
00:18:02,725 --> 00:18:04,845
I am supplying the British Government

264
00:18:04,965 --> 00:18:08,885
with information on his organisation,

265
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:14,365
and in return, they are giving me
favourable terms on defence contracts.

266
00:18:14,485 --> 00:18:15,885
No.

267
00:18:16,965 --> 00:18:19,725
You're doing it because you think
somebody should stop him.

268
00:18:19,845 --> 00:18:21,485
I saw your face when he was speaking.

269
00:18:23,605 --> 00:18:26,005
You're doing it because you think
it's the right thing to do.

270
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,805
All this time, you just did things
that feel nice...

271
00:18:28,925 --> 00:18:30,645
...because you can afford it.

272
00:18:30,765 --> 00:18:33,725
Lizzie, please. Please. Please stop.

273
00:18:36,205 --> 00:18:37,525
Don't scare me...

274
00:18:38,845 --> 00:18:41,645
...by saying you see things in my face.

275
00:18:42,885 --> 00:18:45,085
I still want things that feel nice.

276
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:07,245
Linda...

277
00:19:09,405 --> 00:19:10,885
Shh. Shh.

278
00:19:14,885 --> 00:19:16,365
Linda...

279
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,605
Let's go.

280
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:20,725
Hmm?

281
00:19:20,845 --> 00:19:22,805
Let's go, let's leave.

282
00:19:24,325 --> 00:19:27,245
Let's get in the car.
We'll go and pick up Billy.

283
00:19:29,045 --> 00:19:30,965
We'll drive to the docks.

284
00:19:31,085 --> 00:19:32,485
Any dock you want.

285
00:19:35,205 --> 00:19:36,685
We'll get on a boat.

286
00:19:36,805 --> 00:19:38,325
We'll sail away.

287
00:19:38,445 --> 00:19:39,765
You and me.

288
00:19:41,445 --> 00:19:43,005
Any destination.

289
00:19:50,605 --> 00:19:52,205
Be careful, it's...

290
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:53,885
It's broken everywhere.

291
00:19:57,045 --> 00:19:59,165
We leave tonight. Hmm?

292
00:20:00,765 --> 00:20:02,525
We'd leave this place.

293
00:20:02,645 --> 00:20:04,285
We never come back, Linda.

294
00:20:05,645 --> 00:20:07,205
We never come back.

295
00:20:08,365 --> 00:20:09,965
I mean that.

296
00:20:13,845 --> 00:20:15,725
We go before it gets light.

297
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:19,645
Say yes.

298
00:20:21,285 --> 00:20:22,885
I've got a better idea.

299
00:20:26,445 --> 00:20:27,845
You stay here...

300
00:20:29,405 --> 00:20:31,645
...living inside your head.

301
00:20:33,445 --> 00:20:35,885
Inside your life. Inside your war.

302
00:20:43,725 --> 00:20:46,445
I'm glad I didn't shoot you.

303
00:20:50,645 --> 00:20:52,765
It would have been a kindness.

304
00:21:01,605 --> 00:21:04,125
Now get out.

305
00:21:06,285 --> 00:21:07,645
Please...

306
00:22:20,245 --> 00:22:23,245
An evening with a bunch
of fucking Gypsies.

307
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:51,845
Peter! Peter! Kick it here!

308
00:22:57,965 --> 00:22:59,765
Kick it here, mister!

309
00:23:08,765 --> 00:23:11,965
This is a cheque guarantee,
signed by Mosley...

310
00:23:13,205 --> 00:23:16,045
...on behalf of a man
called Jimmy McCavern.

311
00:23:16,165 --> 00:23:17,605
A cheque for what?

312
00:23:17,725 --> 00:23:20,725
Well, I said it was
for the sale of a gin distillery.

313
00:23:20,845 --> 00:23:22,485
But it doesn't matter.

314
00:23:24,005 --> 00:23:26,365
It is direct evidence of a link
between Mosley

315
00:23:26,485 --> 00:23:29,525
and the head
of an organised criminal network.

316
00:23:29,645 --> 00:23:33,085
A relationship he will try to deny...

317
00:23:34,245 --> 00:23:36,525
...after the bonfire of all conventions.

318
00:23:37,645 --> 00:23:40,845
It also contains the names of MPs
who have signed up to the movement,

319
00:23:40,965 --> 00:23:43,925
and those MPs who are sympathetic

320
00:23:44,045 --> 00:23:48,445
but will not show their hand until
the organisation is announced officially.

321
00:23:48,565 --> 00:23:50,245
On 2nd January.

322
00:23:52,005 --> 00:23:54,485
In Grosvenor House. You might want
to write some of this down.

323
00:23:54,605 --> 00:23:58,125
I am experiencing resistance
from my superior officers too.

324
00:24:03,005 --> 00:24:04,925
This isn't intelligence, Younger.

325
00:24:06,085 --> 00:24:07,725
This is evidence.

326
00:24:07,845 --> 00:24:09,285
Give it to the Branch.

327
00:24:09,405 --> 00:24:10,645
Special Branch?

328
00:24:10,765 --> 00:24:13,725
Half of whom spend their lives
defending the Union against Fenians,

329
00:24:13,845 --> 00:24:15,341
and the other half who spend their lives

330
00:24:15,365 --> 00:24:18,045
defending men like Mosley
against socialists.

331
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,525
I heard about his speech
at your house the other night.

332
00:24:20,645 --> 00:24:23,045
Was favourably reported as
the passionate

333
00:24:23,165 --> 00:24:27,605
and spontaneous outpouring of a man
moved by the emotions of a ballet.

334
00:24:27,725 --> 00:24:28,885
Reported where?

335
00:24:29,005 --> 00:24:30,725
<i>Daily Mail. Morning Post. Daily Mirror.</i>

336
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:34,045
It's upper, middle and working class,

337
00:24:34,165 --> 00:24:36,365
all united in admiration.

338
00:24:39,245 --> 00:24:43,205
Also, I'm being asked the source
of my information on Mosley.

339
00:24:43,325 --> 00:24:44,645
Which you don't divulge?

340
00:24:44,765 --> 00:24:45,965
No.

341
00:24:47,205 --> 00:24:50,285
And as a result, my six-monthly review
was unfavourable.

342
00:24:51,805 --> 00:24:55,285
They're talking about moving me to
a black and coloured desk in Johannesburg.

343
00:24:56,725 --> 00:25:00,045
I also suspect there are
specific threats to me personally

344
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:03,445
from an organisation called Section D.

345
00:25:04,605 --> 00:25:06,885
I believe you've had a dispute
with them in the past.

346
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:10,365
Sit down, Younger.

347
00:25:19,045 --> 00:25:20,365
Yeech...

348
00:25:25,605 --> 00:25:27,405
We are now Section D.

349
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:29,205
And I fucking beat them.

350
00:25:32,165 --> 00:25:34,725
You're a soldier, I'm a soldier.

351
00:25:34,845 --> 00:25:39,885
There are elements within the state
who are prepared to kill.

352
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:43,085
We need to meet them unafraid.

353
00:25:46,685 --> 00:25:48,245
Spoken like a true believer.

354
00:25:50,445 --> 00:25:53,565
My superiors also ask why
the information on Jessie Eden

355
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:55,765
and the Communists
has apparently dried up.

356
00:25:57,445 --> 00:25:59,445
Why has it dried up, Mr Shelby?

357
00:26:01,045 --> 00:26:03,085
Your sister has an interesting theory.

358
00:26:03,205 --> 00:26:04,925
She thinks perhaps at last

359
00:26:05,045 --> 00:26:09,485
Tommy Shelby has actually started
to believe in something.

360
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:21,605
Younger.

361
00:26:23,605 --> 00:26:26,765
Please don't listen
to my sister's opinions of me.

362
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:29,845
They are always... hopeful.

363
00:26:31,725 --> 00:26:33,445
Therefore they are always wrong.

364
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:14,005
Can you hear me? Look at me.

365
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:16,125
You're going to be all right.
I'll be back.

366
00:28:16,245 --> 00:28:17,445
You'll be OK.

367
00:28:17,565 --> 00:28:19,005
Look at me. Look at me.

368
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:20,365
It's OK.

369
00:28:25,405 --> 00:28:26,605
Fuck!

370
00:28:27,885 --> 00:28:29,205
Call an ambulance!

371
00:28:29,325 --> 00:28:30,765
Call Moss!

372
00:28:30,885 --> 00:28:32,685
Find out where I can reach Ada.
Come on, love.

373
00:28:32,765 --> 00:28:34,245
Up you get. Good girl.

374
00:28:34,365 --> 00:28:36,245
Come on, take her. Take her.

375
00:28:37,805 --> 00:28:40,925
Come on. Up you get. Up you get.
Good boy.

376
00:28:41,045 --> 00:28:42,205
Come on.

377
00:28:42,325 --> 00:28:44,725
In you go. Inside. Stay inside.

378
00:29:38,205 --> 00:29:40,045
Tommy?

379
00:29:40,165 --> 00:29:41,405
Let's sit down, Ada.

380
00:29:41,525 --> 00:29:42,805
What's happened?

381
00:29:44,805 --> 00:29:46,565
Here, sit down, eh?

382
00:29:57,205 --> 00:29:59,085
Ben Younger is dead.

383
00:30:02,285 --> 00:30:04,205
Someone put a bomb in his car.

384
00:30:07,685 --> 00:30:12,165
I don't know how you felt about him
or how bad this is gonna hurt...

385
00:30:13,525 --> 00:30:16,445
...but whatever happens, just remember
you've a baby inside of you.

386
00:30:21,685 --> 00:30:23,405
Oh, God.

387
00:30:24,445 --> 00:30:26,805
Anyone you touch...

388
00:30:28,085 --> 00:30:30,005
Which means anyone I touch.

389
00:30:31,285 --> 00:30:33,285
Which means anyone any of us touch.

390
00:30:34,285 --> 00:30:36,525
He never knew I was pregnant.

391
00:30:37,805 --> 00:30:39,325
I hadn't told him.

392
00:30:41,045 --> 00:30:42,485
I didn't love him.

393
00:30:45,205 --> 00:30:46,645
But I liked him.

394
00:30:48,925 --> 00:30:51,565
He was decent and good...

395
00:30:54,405 --> 00:30:56,845
I wasn't gonna marry him.

396
00:31:00,005 --> 00:31:02,525
The baby was a mistake,
but that's OK.

397
00:31:04,765 --> 00:31:08,325
I didn't ask anything of him.

398
00:31:10,365 --> 00:31:12,845
God, he didn't deserve us.

399
00:31:16,685 --> 00:31:20,645
Well, I've spoken to his family -
they're gonna take care of the funeral.

400
00:31:21,965 --> 00:31:25,805
It will go down as an IRA assassination
of a British military officer.

401
00:31:28,925 --> 00:31:30,965
And what was it really?

402
00:31:35,965 --> 00:31:37,445
It was...

403
00:31:38,925 --> 00:31:40,925
...a consequence of good intentions.

404
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:43,805
My good intentions.

405
00:31:46,085 --> 00:31:49,805
I pushed him to report on the fascists.
I thought it was the right thing to do.

406
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:55,165
And as a result,
Section D or the Branch or Intelligence

407
00:31:55,285 --> 00:31:56,685
had him killed.

408
00:32:10,085 --> 00:32:11,765
There was a kid...

409
00:32:11,885 --> 00:32:14,045
...died in the explosion.

410
00:32:15,485 --> 00:32:16,925
He was ten years old.

411
00:32:18,325 --> 00:32:19,805
It's funny...

412
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:23,325
...isn't it, how it works?

413
00:32:25,605 --> 00:32:27,885
Look, Tommy.

414
00:32:29,565 --> 00:32:32,405
Don't give yourself this excuse.

415
00:32:36,765 --> 00:32:38,645
He was ten years old.

416
00:32:40,205 --> 00:32:42,285
If I'd have stuck to what I do,

417
00:32:42,405 --> 00:32:45,285
he'd still be kicking a ball
in the street.

418
00:32:48,485 --> 00:32:49,765
It's funny, isn't it?

419
00:33:47,245 --> 00:33:48,845
Push the button.

420
00:33:49,925 --> 00:33:51,965
Unlock the door and come home to me.

421
00:34:15,565 --> 00:34:18,165
Chinese lanterns. Brass on deck.

422
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,645
God fucking help us.

423
00:34:54,165 --> 00:34:56,965
Chang will be waiting at the dock
with the cargo.

424
00:34:57,085 --> 00:34:59,765
We weigh it,
we load it, we fuck off.

425
00:35:15,925 --> 00:35:17,605
Where the fuck is Chang?

426
00:35:25,085 --> 00:35:26,725
Isiah, take point.

427
00:35:28,445 --> 00:35:29,725
Look lively.

428
00:35:31,725 --> 00:35:34,525
Right, there's your lanterns.

429
00:35:34,645 --> 00:35:37,045
Where the fuck are the Chinese?

430
00:35:37,165 --> 00:35:39,085
All right, Charlie.

431
00:35:39,205 --> 00:35:41,445
Arthur, it's Chang!

432
00:35:42,685 --> 00:35:44,245
Christ!

433
00:35:46,405 --> 00:35:48,325
Get over! Get over. Get over!

434
00:35:49,725 --> 00:35:53,085
I knew we shouldn't trust these fuckers
and their fucking lanterns.

435
00:35:59,325 --> 00:36:01,525
If it's the police, hold fire.

436
00:36:01,645 --> 00:36:04,485
Chang, where's the stuff? Where is it?

437
00:36:04,605 --> 00:36:07,405
They didn't look like police.
Smelt of gin.

438
00:36:07,525 --> 00:36:10,525
They said they were taking the opium
on behalf of the King.

439
00:36:10,645 --> 00:36:12,245
Then they saw your boat coming.

440
00:36:12,365 --> 00:36:14,045
So, were they Italian?

441
00:36:14,165 --> 00:36:16,605
- Were they Italian?
- Irish.

442
00:36:16,725 --> 00:36:18,085
Irish, I think...

443
00:36:18,205 --> 00:36:19,565
Oh, fuck.

444
00:36:19,685 --> 00:36:21,765
Fuck! Charlie,

445
00:36:21,885 --> 00:36:23,165
my gun. Give me the gun.

446
00:36:23,285 --> 00:36:24,525
Give it up, that's it.

447
00:36:24,645 --> 00:36:26,605
Listen. Listen to me.

448
00:36:26,725 --> 00:36:28,685
They're Titanic boys out there, right?

449
00:36:28,805 --> 00:36:30,365
They're out of Poplar.

450
00:36:30,485 --> 00:36:32,925
In the war, they were very capable.

451
00:36:33,045 --> 00:36:34,845
Very capable soldiers.

452
00:36:34,965 --> 00:36:36,685
So was I.

453
00:36:36,805 --> 00:36:39,325
I was a fucking capable soldier, too.

454
00:36:40,645 --> 00:36:44,405
Hey! Hey, you fucking bastards!

455
00:37:03,165 --> 00:37:04,405
Arthur! Arthur!

456
00:37:04,525 --> 00:37:07,405
Stop firing! Arthur, they've gone.

457
00:37:12,405 --> 00:37:14,445
To any of you still alive,

458
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,845
you do not fuck

459
00:37:16,965 --> 00:37:21,485
with the Peaky fucking Blinders!

460
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,405
Huh!

461
00:37:47,685 --> 00:37:49,005
Yeah.

462
00:37:52,285 --> 00:37:53,525
Here we go.

463
00:38:02,445 --> 00:38:03,805
Chang?

464
00:38:07,965 --> 00:38:09,245
Purest ever in Europe.

465
00:38:09,365 --> 00:38:10,525
Arthur?

466
00:38:10,645 --> 00:38:12,925
There's a dead man in a copper's uniform.

467
00:38:13,045 --> 00:38:14,605
Should I throw him in the cut?

468
00:38:15,965 --> 00:38:17,245
No.

469
00:38:17,365 --> 00:38:19,445
No, he'll float, won't he, eh?

470
00:38:19,565 --> 00:38:21,805
Even Irishmen fucking float.

471
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:26,725
No, go and fire... go and fire the kilns.

472
00:38:26,845 --> 00:38:28,725
But there are men working them.

473
00:38:29,845 --> 00:38:33,685
Why do you carry a gun, Isiah, eh?

474
00:38:33,805 --> 00:38:35,405
And razor blades in your cap?

475
00:38:37,325 --> 00:38:39,805
Cos you're a Peaky fucking Blinder,
that's why.

476
00:38:39,925 --> 00:38:43,165
You take that body
and you burn it to the bone.

477
00:38:44,165 --> 00:38:46,605
And if anybody speaks to you on that...

478
00:38:47,565 --> 00:38:50,925
...you offer them the chance
to burn in that furnace with him.

479
00:38:52,045 --> 00:38:53,285
Right?

480
00:38:53,405 --> 00:38:54,565
Yes, Arthur.

481
00:38:55,605 --> 00:38:58,805
Yeah. Yeah.

482
00:38:58,925 --> 00:39:01,885
Do we know the people
who tried to trick us?

483
00:39:02,005 --> 00:39:03,205
The uncles will be mad.

484
00:39:03,325 --> 00:39:04,925
Fuck your uncles.

485
00:39:05,045 --> 00:39:07,285
And your aunts, your cousins,
all of them, right?

486
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:13,685
Curly! Load this up onto the boat.
Let's get back to Birmingham, eh?

487
00:39:13,805 --> 00:39:16,405
Get back to fucking civilisation

488
00:39:16,525 --> 00:39:18,525
and find out who's been talking.

489
00:39:18,645 --> 00:39:20,325
Yeah! Now look,

490
00:39:20,445 --> 00:39:22,725
the Titanic heard about this, right?

491
00:39:22,845 --> 00:39:27,205
That means every gang from Poplar
to Birmingham will want to be here.

492
00:39:28,645 --> 00:39:30,405
Well, let 'em come, eh?

493
00:39:30,525 --> 00:39:33,005
Let 'em come, Aberama.

494
00:39:33,125 --> 00:39:34,445
Yeah.

495
00:39:34,565 --> 00:39:36,605
Oh, let 'em fucking come!

496
00:41:10,845 --> 00:41:12,605
Hat and coat off.

497
00:41:24,525 --> 00:41:26,605
Stand up against the wall.

498
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:33,485
For your own safety, I need to search you

499
00:41:33,605 --> 00:41:37,125
for items that could potentially
be used as weapons against you.

500
00:41:54,765 --> 00:41:56,365
Oh, that's nice.

501
00:42:15,885 --> 00:42:17,885
He was my friend.

502
00:42:18,005 --> 00:42:20,365
Yeah, well, he's nobody's friend any more.

503
00:42:20,485 --> 00:42:22,645
He's a fucking animal.

504
00:42:22,765 --> 00:42:25,245
Laces out of your shoes.

505
00:42:38,605 --> 00:42:40,125
Table.

506
00:43:07,765 --> 00:43:09,725
Barney? Visitor.

507
00:43:10,845 --> 00:43:13,725
This one's real.

508
00:43:13,845 --> 00:43:15,245
You can wait here.

509
00:43:15,365 --> 00:43:17,085
No. I can't.

510
00:43:25,565 --> 00:43:27,045
It's your funeral.

511
00:43:27,165 --> 00:43:28,845
- I'll have to lock you in.
- Yeah.

512
00:43:52,925 --> 00:43:54,365
Hello, Barney.

513
00:43:55,365 --> 00:43:56,845
Arthur says to say hello.

514
00:43:58,965 --> 00:44:00,445
Sergeant Major?

515
00:44:01,965 --> 00:44:03,205
You're alive?

516
00:44:03,325 --> 00:44:05,405
Arthur's alive, John's dead,

517
00:44:05,525 --> 00:44:07,365
Danny's dead, Freddie's dead...

518
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:10,965
...Jeremiah preaches the gospel barefoot.

519
00:44:12,605 --> 00:44:13,725
Yeah.

520
00:44:14,805 --> 00:44:16,005
And I'm alive.

521
00:44:20,085 --> 00:44:22,565
Them as have gone are the lucky ones.

522
00:44:26,045 --> 00:44:28,245
Thanks for the letters you send,
Sergeant Major.

523
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:31,965
Yeah, Arthur mostly writes them.
I just... just sign them.

524
00:44:34,285 --> 00:44:36,925
How the fuck do you write back?
With your fucking teeth?

525
00:44:37,045 --> 00:44:38,765
No, they stick the pen up me arse.

526
00:44:53,045 --> 00:44:54,845
Someone in here said your name.

527
00:44:56,445 --> 00:44:59,245
They said
out there you are a politician now.

528
00:44:59,365 --> 00:45:00,885
Sometimes I am.

529
00:45:03,045 --> 00:45:05,085
I didn't know if it was real, comrade.

530
00:45:06,685 --> 00:45:10,165
I see rats coming out of bodies
like at the black wood.

531
00:45:10,285 --> 00:45:12,525
The shit they give me in here...

532
00:45:19,405 --> 00:45:21,045
Hey, Barney, look at me.

533
00:45:30,245 --> 00:45:32,325
Barney, this here is opium and cyanide.

534
00:45:33,325 --> 00:45:34,525
It'll bring on a heart attack.

535
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:38,005
They won't even check the cause.
You won't feel a fucking thing.

536
00:45:43,965 --> 00:45:45,125
So, here.

537
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:50,165
You're in here forever, brother.

538
00:45:51,645 --> 00:45:53,645
You don't have the use
of your fucking hands.

539
00:45:55,605 --> 00:45:57,365
You're still in the tunnels.

540
00:45:59,005 --> 00:46:00,685
I can give this to you now.

541
00:46:02,325 --> 00:46:04,165
Do you want it?

542
00:46:09,645 --> 00:46:10,725
No.

543
00:46:26,525 --> 00:46:28,125
Why not?

544
00:46:33,325 --> 00:46:34,765
I know.

545
00:46:37,245 --> 00:46:38,885
I know.

546
00:46:40,805 --> 00:46:42,245
You still remember...

547
00:46:42,365 --> 00:46:44,405
...that French waitress.

548
00:46:53,765 --> 00:46:55,725
You still going on about that, Tom?

549
00:46:55,845 --> 00:46:56,845
Yeah.

550
00:46:57,845 --> 00:46:59,461
Did you fuck her before me?
Because whoever did

551
00:46:59,485 --> 00:47:01,765
gave me the fucking clap.
But I'm guessing it was you.

552
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:04,125
- Yes, I fucked her before you did!
- Yeah.

553
00:47:07,245 --> 00:47:09,165
- She was beautiful.
- She was.

554
00:47:09,285 --> 00:47:10,525
She was.

555
00:47:12,205 --> 00:47:13,205
And I reckon

556
00:47:13,325 --> 00:47:15,245
I was second best after Barney.

557
00:47:16,605 --> 00:47:18,485
Why did you bring the capsule, Tom?

558
00:47:18,605 --> 00:47:20,325
You're in here, Barney,

559
00:47:20,445 --> 00:47:23,685
you have no hands, there is no daylight...

560
00:47:24,965 --> 00:47:26,485
...and you don't wanna die.

561
00:47:27,605 --> 00:47:29,005
No, I don't.

562
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:36,165
Because one day things might change.

563
00:47:45,765 --> 00:47:46,765
Yeah.

564
00:47:49,205 --> 00:47:50,885
Things might change.

565
00:47:54,125 --> 00:47:55,685
Maybe they already have.

566
00:47:57,845 --> 00:47:59,685
Come here, Barney.

567
00:48:00,725 --> 00:48:02,085
Come here.

568
00:48:05,285 --> 00:48:07,045
What if I could break you out of here?

569
00:48:08,125 --> 00:48:09,805
Why would you break me out?

570
00:48:11,325 --> 00:48:14,765
See, the trouble with the people in here
is the fucking meds they keep you on.

571
00:48:16,965 --> 00:48:19,685
Ten years since we were back,

572
00:48:19,805 --> 00:48:21,685
Barney, ten fucking years.

573
00:48:23,605 --> 00:48:25,005
Maybe the storm has passed.

574
00:48:25,125 --> 00:48:26,765
Passed for you, then, has it, Tom?

575
00:48:29,085 --> 00:48:30,965
What would the world do with me
if I was out?

576
00:48:31,085 --> 00:48:32,365
I've a job for you.

577
00:48:34,165 --> 00:48:35,165
Fuck!

578
00:48:35,205 --> 00:48:36,365
Barney...

579
00:48:37,845 --> 00:48:41,525
Barney, you were the best fucking sniper
in our company. Never missed.

580
00:48:42,845 --> 00:48:44,885
I can use that man.

581
00:48:45,925 --> 00:48:50,045
I'll get you the latest BSA,
fucking... telescopic sights.

582
00:48:51,205 --> 00:48:52,325
Who am I shooting?

583
00:48:52,445 --> 00:48:55,005
Fuck do you care, Barney?
Get that fucking thing off,

584
00:48:55,125 --> 00:48:57,365
get you free.

585
00:48:57,485 --> 00:48:59,645
- Are you all right in there?
- Grand in here.

586
00:49:03,405 --> 00:49:04,925
What do you say, Barney?

587
00:49:05,925 --> 00:49:07,485
I'll come for you...

588
00:49:08,485 --> 00:49:10,525
...after midnight on Wednesday.

589
00:49:10,645 --> 00:49:12,245
I don't keep track of days, Tom.

590
00:49:12,365 --> 00:49:13,365
Don't have to.

591
00:49:13,485 --> 00:49:16,405
You'll know it will be Wednesday,
cos there'll be a big fucking bang.

592
00:49:17,405 --> 00:49:19,085
All right.

593
00:49:23,645 --> 00:49:24,645
Big fucking bang.

594
00:49:24,685 --> 00:49:27,685
Big fucking bang.

595
00:49:27,805 --> 00:49:29,165
Big fucking bang.

596
00:50:14,485 --> 00:50:15,965
It's fucking Wednesday!

597
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:21,125
Big bang on Wednesday!

598
00:50:40,405 --> 00:50:43,045
They called from the Black Boy in Knowle.

599
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:44,725
They'll be here any minute.

600
00:50:45,725 --> 00:50:47,805
I hear you agreed to give up the north.

601
00:50:49,365 --> 00:50:53,285
I hear... there needs to be
some certainty in the south.

602
00:50:53,405 --> 00:50:56,685
Some of my people were attacked
by members of the Titanic,

603
00:50:56,805 --> 00:50:59,045
who've heard about a cargo.

604
00:50:59,165 --> 00:51:01,325
Mr Mosley is open to suggestion

605
00:51:01,445 --> 00:51:04,245
regarding who he can rely on
to offer him support in London.

606
00:51:05,485 --> 00:51:09,885
Well, I would suggest the most competent
organiser of men in the south...

607
00:51:10,005 --> 00:51:11,925
...is Alfie Solomons.

608
00:51:12,045 --> 00:51:14,045
He's dead.

609
00:51:16,005 --> 00:51:17,365
And he's Jewish!

610
00:51:18,365 --> 00:51:20,965
And I'd say as far as
our boss is concerned,

611
00:51:21,085 --> 00:51:24,485
him being dead would be less
of an obstacle than him being Jewish.

612
00:51:25,885 --> 00:51:28,325
I think he'll give London to the Italians.

613
00:51:28,445 --> 00:51:30,605
He likes Italians.

614
00:51:31,965 --> 00:51:34,085
That'll mean more concessions
on your part,

615
00:51:34,205 --> 00:51:37,205
but you're going to have
to accept it, tinker boy.

616
00:51:39,365 --> 00:51:40,565
I like Wincanton.

617
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:43,325
It's a grand old racecourse.

618
00:51:45,765 --> 00:51:46,845
And that brother of yours,

619
00:51:46,965 --> 00:51:49,605
the one who left me a hand grenade...

620
00:51:52,165 --> 00:51:56,085
...he'd be the first of you tinkers
I'd go for if our truce should end

621
00:51:56,205 --> 00:51:57,565
and the whistle blew.

622
00:51:57,685 --> 00:52:00,445
Good. He's in the mood for a quarrel.

623
00:52:03,885 --> 00:52:07,085
- We had a brush with the Titanic, Tom.
- Yeah, I heard.

624
00:52:07,205 --> 00:52:11,205
Yeah. Fun night. Got noisy, though.

625
00:52:12,525 --> 00:52:16,125
And to think they all said I was mad
to take me dad with me, eh?

626
00:52:16,245 --> 00:52:17,405
Your dad? Who's your dad?

627
00:52:17,525 --> 00:52:19,805
This is my fucking dad.

628
00:52:21,045 --> 00:52:22,845
Right here.

629
00:52:22,965 --> 00:52:24,525
This is my fucking dad.

630
00:52:24,645 --> 00:52:25,965
Where's Aberama?

631
00:52:28,005 --> 00:52:30,125
He got off at Solihull.

632
00:52:30,245 --> 00:52:33,365
Said if he sees Billy Boy here...

633
00:52:34,405 --> 00:52:36,485
...he'll cut his fucking throat.

634
00:52:36,605 --> 00:52:37,605
Tell the tinker

635
00:52:37,725 --> 00:52:39,805
he's welcome to come and try it
any time.

636
00:52:39,925 --> 00:52:41,205
Mm.

637
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:42,485
Is it all aboard?

638
00:52:47,325 --> 00:52:48,485
Yeah.

639
00:52:48,605 --> 00:52:49,845
It's all there.

640
00:52:50,845 --> 00:52:52,485
We weighed it at the wharf.

641
00:52:52,605 --> 00:52:53,925
We used cockney scales.

642
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:56,085
I wouldn't trust 'em.
They're probably crooked.

643
00:52:57,085 --> 00:53:01,005
- But, er, I reckon seven tons.
- Curly?

644
00:53:03,125 --> 00:53:04,365
Put ten sacks of flour

645
00:53:04,485 --> 00:53:07,285
- onto Mr McCavern's boat.
- Tom!

646
00:53:08,325 --> 00:53:09,765
I-I don't think it's really flour.

647
00:53:09,885 --> 00:53:12,165
I know, Curly. Just do as I say.

648
00:53:12,285 --> 00:53:13,565
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

649
00:53:13,685 --> 00:53:14,805
Curly?

650
00:53:19,845 --> 00:53:21,005
Hey, Arthur?

651
00:53:21,125 --> 00:53:23,525
Someday, yes?

652
00:53:23,645 --> 00:53:24,925
You and me.

653
00:53:25,965 --> 00:53:28,605
Oh, Tommy, hey?

654
00:53:28,725 --> 00:53:30,285
Fascists, hmm?

655
00:53:31,285 --> 00:53:33,085
Look at 'em.

656
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:37,325
I fucking hate 'em. Always have done.

657
00:53:38,685 --> 00:53:40,525
But you...

658
00:53:40,645 --> 00:53:42,005
You, Billy Boy...

659
00:53:43,085 --> 00:53:46,485
...oh, you're special.
Y'know, I fucking like him, Tommy.

660
00:53:46,605 --> 00:53:48,485
I like yer.

661
00:53:48,605 --> 00:53:50,365
I do. You're a man after me own heart.

662
00:53:50,485 --> 00:53:52,525
- Someday, Mr Shelby.
- Yeah.

663
00:53:52,645 --> 00:53:53,765
- Someday.
- Yeah.

664
00:53:54,885 --> 00:53:55,965
Yeah.

665
00:54:02,165 --> 00:54:04,005
You just tell me when, Tom.

666
00:54:05,005 --> 00:54:06,525
You just tell me when.

667
00:54:09,365 --> 00:54:10,965
So, er...

668
00:54:11,085 --> 00:54:14,165
- ...so you spoke to Barney Thomason, eh?
- Yeah.

669
00:54:16,245 --> 00:54:17,645
Barney Thomason...

670
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:20,565
...is gonna kill...

671
00:54:20,685 --> 00:54:23,885
...Oswald Mosley,
shoot him in the fucking head.

672
00:54:25,205 --> 00:54:26,205
Yep.

673
00:54:27,365 --> 00:54:29,005
While he's on stage.

674
00:54:29,125 --> 00:54:30,885
While I'm stood next to him.

675
00:54:32,485 --> 00:54:35,285
And then I will take over
as leader of the party...

676
00:54:36,325 --> 00:54:39,725
...and you and Aberama can take care
of that bastard McCavern.

677
00:54:41,405 --> 00:54:45,125
I had more complicated strategies in mind
for Mr Mosley.

678
00:54:46,125 --> 00:54:47,285
Then he spoke badly

679
00:54:47,405 --> 00:54:48,765
to my wife.

680
00:54:50,405 --> 00:54:52,645
It's going to be
a busy few weeks, brother.

681
00:54:52,765 --> 00:54:53,965
Yeah.
