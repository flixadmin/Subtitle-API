the Soviet people have had
enough of this accident.

They want us to clean this up,

and we have entrusted you
with this serious task.

479
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:59,440
Because of the nature
of the working area,

480
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:03,480
you will each have no more than
90 seconds to solve this problem.

481
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:06,440
Listen carefully to
each of my instructions,

This is for your own safety

00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:16,110

Toptunov was telling the truth.

They shut the reactor
down, and then it exploded.

Please, believe me when I tell you that

569
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:59,280
I had no idea it could
cause an explosion.

570
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,280
- None of us knew.
- None of you knew what?

571
00:57:03,570 --> 00:57:06,980
In 1975, in an RBMK
reactor in Leningrad,

572
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:09,070
a fuel channel ruptured.

573
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:10,940
The operators pressed AZ-5,

574
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:13,780
but instead of the power
going down immediately,

575
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:16,730
for a brief moment it went up.

576
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:18,420
How is that possible?

577
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:20,030
Well, this was the very question posed

578
00:57:20,030 --> 00:57:22,030
by a colleague of mine named Volkov.

579
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:24,070
He's the one who wrote this article.

580
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:27,900
When an RBMK reactor runs at low
power, it's notoriously unstable.

581
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:31,320
Prone to swings in reactivity.

582
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:32,820
Under normal circumstances,

583
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:34,730
the control rods can
compensate for that.

584
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:36,190
Under normal circumstances.

585
00:57:36,190 --> 00:57:39,730
The Chernobyl staff stalled
the reactor during the test.

586
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:41,650
They pulled almost all
the control rods out

587
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:42,920
to bring the power back up.

588
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:45,570
This is what Volkov
learned from Leningrad.

589
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:47,070
If the boron control rods

590
00:57:47,070 --> 00:57:49,860
are completely withdrawn
from the reactor,

591
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:51,230
when they're put back in,

592
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:54,440
the first thing that
enters the core isn't boron.

593
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,650
It's graphite.

594
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:02,150
The control rods have graphite tips

595
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:04,650
that displace water and steam.

596
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:07,070
So the reactivity doesn't go down.

597
00:58:07,070 --> 00:58:09,230
It goes up dramatically.

598
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:12,690
<font color="#ff00ff">(SCOFFS)</font> Why on Earth would
they press that button?

599
00:58:12,690 --> 00:58:14,690
They didn't know.

600
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:19,230
<font color="#138ce9">LEGASOV:</font> Volkov warned the Kremlin,

601

Ah.

605
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:33,900

607

608
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,400
Because the flaw will
not lead to an explosion

609
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:49,650
unless the operators have pushed
the reactor to the edge of disaster.

610
00:58:49,650 --> 00:58:52,570
- So it is their fault?
- Yes.

611
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:54,610
But not only their fault.

Is that what you're
going to say in Vienna?

614
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:04,150
<font color="#ff00ff">(SIGHS)</font>

615
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:07,230
You can't possibly be that naive.

616
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:10,730
There are 16 RBMK reactors

617
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:13,610
running in the Soviet Union right now.

618
00:59:13,610 --> 00:59:15,650
We have to fix them.

619
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:18,440
The only way to do that is to go public,

620
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:20,530
force the Central
Committee to take action.

621
00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:23,610
What you're proposing is that
Legasov humiliate a nation

622
00:59:23,610 --> 00:59:26,690
that is obsessed with
not being humiliated.

623
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:29,230
We can make a deal with the KGB.

624
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:31,400
You'll leave this
information out in Vienna,

625
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:34,610
and they quietly let us
fix the remaining reactors.

626
00:59:34,610 --> 00:59:37,030
A deal with the KGB?

627
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:38,740
And I'm "naive."

628
00:59:39,990 --> 00:59:43,530
<font color="#138ce9">SHCHERBINA:</font> They'll go after your
family, they'll go after your friends.

629
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:46,440
<font color="#138ce9">KHOMYUK:</font> You have a chance
to talk to the world, Valery.

630
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,400
If that chance was mine...

631
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,070
But it isn't, is it?

632
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:54,530
I've know braver souls
than you, Khomyuk.

633
00:59:54,530 --> 00:59:56,780
Men who had their
moment and did nothing.

634
00:59:56,780 --> 01:00:00,980
Because when it's your life and
the lives of everyone you love,

635
01:00:00,990 --> 01:00:03,690
your moral conviction
doesn't mean anything.

636
01:00:03,690 --> 01:00:05,900
It leaves you.

637
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:10,440
And all you want at that
moment is not to be shot.

638
01:00:14,490 --> 01:00:16,940
Do you know the name Vasily Ignatenko?

639
01:00:16,940 --> 01:00:18,490
No.

640
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:22,650
He was a fireman.

641
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:25,820
He died two weeks after the accident.

642
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:28,580
I've been looking in on his widow.

643
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:30,450
She gave birth.

644
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:32,150
A girl.

645
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:34,440
The baby lived for four hours.

646
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:37,570
They said the radiation
would have killed the mother,

647
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:40,040
but the baby absorbed it instead.

648
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:41,460
Her baby.

649
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,940
We live in a country

650
01:00:44,940 --> 01:00:47,650
where children have to
die to save their mothers.

651
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:51,030
To hell with your deal.

652
01:00:53,030 --> 01:00:55,360
And to hell with our lives.

653
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:59,190
Someone has to start telling the truth.

654
01:01:13,360 --> 01:01:15,820
<font color="#138ce9">TARAKANOV:</font> Congratulations, comrades.

655
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:19,440
You are the last of 3,828 men.

your duties perfectly.

I wish you good health and long life.

All of you are awarded
a bonus of 800 rubles.
