1
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,800
<i>Hello, Nayak. I know,
you're suspicious about me.</i>

2
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,520
<i>There was a police raid
and they nabbed me.</i>

3
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,320
They asked me many questions.

4
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,720
You must be wondering
what all Sasya revealed.

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,480
<i>I thought, let me personally tell you
about what happened there.</i>

6
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,520
<i>I want to clear the air.</i>

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,840
You already know, I book an entire floor
of the hotel for me.

8
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,120
The police got suspicious
and they came to check.

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,800
So, they came. And the raid was for...

10
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,520
it was a raid to nab
those prostitutes, actually.

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,040
You must be thinking
Sasya has all important...

12
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,560
documents and papers.

13
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,760
What if... something got exposed?

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,960
But they came only to nab girls.

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,960
They opened the wardrobe,
closed it on finding no girl there.

16
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,240
They checked under the bed, found no girl.
They didn't check for anything else.

17
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,720
<i>They took me to the police station
and I played smart there. I said,</i>

18
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:09,880
"Sir, you are on duty
and are doing your job.

19
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,520
But you cannot behave like this
with an honest man.

20
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,640
I don't deal in flesh trade."
I told them clearly.

21
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,840
<i>They heard me out and agreed
with what I said.</i>

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,440
And then they asked me to leave.

23
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,680
<i>I said, "Okay, sir."</i>

24
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,080
<i>I knew, they could follow me
and so, I did not go to the hotel.</i>

25
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,800
I checked-in to an ordinary hotel in Vashi
that was close by.

26
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,240
<i>It was a cheap hotel.
I stayed there for three days.</i>

27
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,680
<i>Then I left from there
and went to the hostel.</i>

28
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,480
So that they think, I have no money.

29
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,560
I then went to a charitable inn
and stayed there.

30
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:44,680
I did all this to confuse them,
if they were tracking me.

31
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:48,440
<i>That is when I got your message
asking me to go to Hyderabad.</i>

32
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,240
So, then I came to Hyderabad.

33
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,760
Right now, I am here.
Look, this is today's newspaper.

34
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,240
<i>Sir, I've been working
for you for five years. I mean...</i>

35
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,640
<i>to be honest,
I've literally struggled for you.</i>

36
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,560
<i>Are you still suspecting me?</i>

37
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,400
<i>Please talk to me on direct line,
at least once.</i>

38
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,200
<i>Do at least that.</i>

39
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,160
What should I do?

40
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,040
My brain doesn't stop working
at my behest.

41
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,480
I can shut my eyes, but not my brain.

42
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,800
It keeps working.

43
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,920
So, Sasya is in Hyderabad
on Nayak's orders?

44
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,240
Yes, sir.

45
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,440
Sir, if Sasya is not in Mumbai,

46
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,560
then Nayak won't be able to connect him
with Bhumi mentally.

47
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,240
And Bhumi hates Sasya anyway.

48
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,320
It's good for her, if he is not around.

49
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,680
Does she even hate anyone?

50
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,080
She is turning out
to be quite a bitch actually.

51
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,760
Pardon my French.

52
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,960
What if I am creating a monster, sir?

53
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,200
-Hey, Rao!
-Hi.

54
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,000
Your tummy is walking ahead of you.

55
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,840
Yes, I've grown fat.

56
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,320
-How are you?
-I'm absolutely fine.

57
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,880
ACP Fernandez. He is my friend.

58
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,000
He used to be in the police force
as an ACP.

59
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,880
-ACP was your final rank, right?
-Yes.

60
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,000
In Karwar, during the case
of arms smuggling...

61
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,920
I was suspended.
You can say it openly. I wouldn't mind.

62
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,960
It's good that you were suspended.
You are earning good money.

63
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,160
He mints money.

64
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,440
Nayak or Nayakudu, whatever his name is,
I heard it during Karwar case.

65
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,680
I thought it was only a story, a myth.

66
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,600
I never found any evidence.

67
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,360
See, there is no evidence.

68
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,560
But are you sure, he exists?

69
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,120
Yes, sir.

70
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,680
During the Karwar incident,
the story was that

71
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,520
he hailed from Andhra Pradesh.

72
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,200
From Rayalaseema area.

73
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,520
Like a scene in Telugu movies,

74
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,840
ten to twenty people in uniform
came with swords.

75
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,160
He belonged to one such family.

76
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,440
Very big, rich landlords.

77
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,440
It's their trademark
to slit one's throat and kill.

78
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:22,160
He caused a bloodbath
for a couple of years.

79
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,800
And then, sold his property and vanished.

80
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,320
That is the story I know.

81
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,560
Sir, if you don't mind, can I bother
you more about Nayak and Karwar?

82
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,360
Of course, you must bother him.

83
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,720
Don't call me to the police station.

84
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,840
Those flashbacks still haunt me.

85
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,400
Four...

86
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,480
three...

87
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,480
two...

88
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,240
<i>Mhatre here.</i>

89
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,720
She is in their car.

90
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,880
Sir, she is in the car.

91
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,440
They're taking another route.

92
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,360
<i>-They're changing the route, sir.</i>
-They're changing the route, sir.

93
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,520
They're taking her towards a ferry.

94
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,080
Bhumi has worn a black burqa.

95
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,080
Sir, they're taking her in a boat.

96
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,720
Sir, the boat is leaving.

97
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,960
Leena, inform Kihim and Alibag
police stations immediately.

98
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,240
Yes, sir.

99
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,240
Fuck! How the fuck did that happen?

100
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,680
Nayakudu...

101
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,440
Yes?

102
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,160
Confusion, right?

103
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,680
Here, there, boat, bikes...

104
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,880
it was necessary.

105
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,960
But now it's easy.

106
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,080
Tell her what you want to eat.
Order for me too.

107
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,080
I made you wait too long, right?

108
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,160
So, I'll take better care of you.

109
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,560
Tell me your phone number.

110
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,760
Why are you quiet? Tell me.

111
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,600
-9819...
-9829764325.

112
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,000
-This is my new phone.
-You've had this phone for six months.

113
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,520
So?

114
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,160
Sometimes... I tell my brain

115
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
that it's enough. Stop.

116
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,360
Sometimes I feel
it's better to get caught.

117
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,720
I don't understand what you're saying.

118
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,800
Let me explain.

119
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,280
Your phone is mirrored on this phone.

120
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,960
All your contacts and their numbers
are on this phone.

121
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,920
Open the list now...

122
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,240
and call any number.

123
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,600
Anyone.

124
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,600
Call anyone listed under alphabet - B.

125
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,440
Keep the phone here. Let me see.

126
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,240
Now call anyone
whose name starts with the alphabet - B.

127
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,760
You can't?

128
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,200
Now, call anyone listed
under alphabet - M, except your mom.

129
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,640
You won't be able to...

130
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,440
because all numbers are fake.

131
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,080
That's not true.

132
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,440
All the numbers in this phone
are of my clients.

133
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,600
Once their work is done, they block me.

134
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,440
Yeah.

135
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,880
That's possible.

136
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,240
I hope that is the truth.

137
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,520
But my brain... is saying something else.

138
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,520
Anna...

139
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,760
Sit.

140
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,960
Have you seen them before?

141
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,560
Do you recognize them?

142
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,600
How many times have you seen them before?

143
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,760
Twice.

144
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,520
Including today or excluding it?

145
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,000
I mean, I'm seeing them today
and once before.

146
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,320
You are a call girl.

147
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,040
You are into flesh trade.

148
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,040
There was a raid
at Sasya's room for call girls.

149
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,360
Is it possible that...

150
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,240
Sasya...

151
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,560
has Sasya sent you here?

152
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,400
-Who Sasya?
-She met him one night, sir.

153
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,040
I might have met him.

154
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,080
The clients don't tell me their names.

155
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,560
If you were in Sasya's room
at the time of the raid,

156
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,120
the police must've caught you too.

157
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,960
What do I say?

158
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,440
Don't say anything.

159
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,760
I'll ask Sasya.

160
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,840
It was working so well.

161
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:04,800
I felt calm. Everything is ruined.

162
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,760
Sir, we'll tell you everything.

163
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,480
We got her that night for Sasya.

164
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,360
He took her in
but came back in five minutes and said,

165
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,080
that she is your type.
And if destined, you two might meet.

166
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,240
That's why,
we took you to her spot on purpose.

167
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,320
We made a mistake, Nayakudu.

168
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,320
Excellent!

169
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,480
Basically,
again we have no idea where Bhumi is.

170
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:34,960
This is our level.

171
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,760
Shameful!

172
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,360
Nayakudu, we swear by God
that we didn't mean to betray you.

173
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,360
We only wanted to please you.

174
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,480
Forgive our lives, please.

175
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,160
-Forgive us.
-What are you doing?

176
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,000
Go. Go and watch movies.

177
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,080
Go on, boys.

178
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,640
What is this?

179
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,200
I don't know what they see in me.

180
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,120
They never make eye contact.

181
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,880
They have a picture of me in their minds
and they assume that's me.

182
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,880
What was your sister's name?

183
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,040
What?

184
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,480
Deepa?

185
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,120
-Rupa.
-Rupa.

186
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,440
Did Mom decide the name or your father?

187
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,480
Rupali is a nice name.

188
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,640
I don't know who chose it.

189
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,400
I don't like... Rupali.

190
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,400
Do you?

191
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,800
It's okay.

192
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,480
Not the name.
I'm talking about your sister.

193
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,120
Everyone has spoiled her.

194
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,000
Right from childhood, she used to roam
around wearing Mom's lipstick and stole.

195
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,000
Nothing changed as she grew up.

196
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,960
She thinks that she's very beautiful.

197
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,400
I don't know what her problem is.

198
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,240
She always boasts
that all men are crazy for her.

199
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,200
Like all men want to have sex with her.

200
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,240
And with you?

201
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,520
Not even my husband
wants to have sex with me.

202
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,560
-Husband?
-That's what Rupa says.

203
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,240
And the husband?

204
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,560
What does he say?

205
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,280
Have you ever told Rupa,

206
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,640
that you earn your income from sex?

207
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,520
How much do you earn for an hour?

208
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,000
Thousand to two thousand bucks.

209
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,040
And according to you,
how much would Rupa get?

210
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:30,960
Obviously more than what I get.

211
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,680
Sure?

212
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,680
You aren't sure, are you?

213
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,480
Even you don't like her, do you?

214
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,120
Rupali.

215
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,840
She enjoys when men stare at her.

216
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,560
Men are assholes.

217
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,960
Do you know what makes her happy the most?

218
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,680
When I walk with her...

219
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,400
and no one looks at me.

220
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,800
I see... happiness in her eyes.

221
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,760
And drama...

222
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,760
that men cause tension to her.

223
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,240
When men will stop looking at her...

224
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,600
then she'll get tensed.

225
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,440
I won't look at her.

226
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,640
She isn't here, is she?

227
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,760
Imagine, she is here.

228
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,840
I will not look at her.

229
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,920
I will look at only you.

230
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,720
-I'll be back, Mhatre.
-Okay.

231
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,200
-Yes Rupa, tell me.
-Any updates on Bhumi?

232
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,120
Bhumi is at the camp. She must be fine.

233
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,800
What kind of training is it?

234
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,120
Don't they allow to call home?

235
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,080
There is network issue there.
I've told you this before.

236
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,800
-Mom is worried.
-Why?

237
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,680
She enjoys being worried,

238
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,160
but you have some connections
with the officers, right?

239
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,720
Please talk to them.

240
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,840
Yes, okay. I'll do something.

241
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,320
Tell your mom not to worry.

242
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,120
It'll affect her health even more.
Take care.

243
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,880
You should've seen her face
when I returned her the phone.

244
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,960
And I told her that I didn't have to give
all that to Hemant...

245
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,680
that he was asking her for.

246
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,520
It felt good...

247
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,120
seeing her face.

248
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,880
I too never bonded well with my family.

249
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,640
We were always in danger.

250
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,640
We used to get threats all the time.

251
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,280
I was born in such a family

252
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,480
that I believed
families are meant to be that way.

253
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,160
Homes are meant to be that way.
But then I grew up,

254
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,000
met people... and realized that...

255
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,000
a home can mean something different too.

256
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,440
Since then, I am searching for a home...

257
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,640
which is free of danger.

258
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,480
But do you know what I think?

259
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,160
I mean I'm scared
that I'm addicted to danger.

260
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,080
I want to go far from danger

261
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,160
but somehow manage to come close to it.

262
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,760
I want everything to be easy and normal

263
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,200
but being normal isn't easy for me.

264
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,120
I try again.

265
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,240
I told you... I try.

266
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,360
-What will you do with me?
-We won't speak about work.

267
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,400
Who sent you? Why did they send you?

268
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,440
Torturing you to get the truth out...

269
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,640
it's such a wastage of time.

270
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,360
I'll get to know about it.

271
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,360
My people will find out.

272
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,160
We will only... talk.

273
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,720
Our personal conversations.

274
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:10,000
Let's do that and see what happens.

275
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,440
-Where are you?
-I'm in Hyderabad, sir.

276
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,200
How will I know where they took her?

277
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,800
<i>You tell me.</i>

278
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,480
Nayakudu hasn't spoken to me
even once since I came here.

279
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,080
<i>Aren't your men there?</i>

280
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,640
Can't you get information from them?

281
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,200
Sir, no one is telling me anything.

282
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,880
Everyone is terrified of Nayakudu.

283
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,680
They aren't speaking to me properly.

284
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,600
Sasya, we didn't agree on this.

285
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,160
You told me that
you'll keep me informed every minute.

286
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,800
Sir, everything is clear.

287
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,680
I work for you, sir.

288
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,240
If I get any information,
I'll call you first.

289
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,160
Can I trust you?

290
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,920
Do you have any other option, sir?

291
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,960
I think Sasya is double-crossing us, sir.

292
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,200
This was Nayak's plan
from the start and we are trapped now.

293
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,440
For God's sake, Fernandez.
Stop flying from one pole to another.

294
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,920
Okay, tell me...

295
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,200
is Sasya's information accurate?

296
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:13,880
Yes, sir.

297
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,320
And information about Nayak's operation
is recorded on the tape.

298
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,600
Yes, it is recorded.

299
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,680
So, if Sasya is with Nayak,

300
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:25,280
why will he give us
all the information on record?

301
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,560
Why will he give us
the details of the operation?

302
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,160
Sir, what if Sasya
is double-crossing Nayak?

303
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,400
There you go.

304
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,880
And... he used us for his mission, sir.

305
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,520
Even if it's true, what is wrong in it?

306
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,160
We will still catch Nayak
and stop his operations.

307
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,080
This is our objective, right?

308
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,360
I don't know, sir.

309
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,480
They belong to a different breed, sir.

310
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,240
The way they think, the way they work...

311
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,000
there is no limit.

312
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,560
Finally, the day has come

313
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,320
when the hero and heroine
of the story meet.

314
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,920
The game my finger started...

315
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,520
will reach its climax here.

316
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,720
Weren't you in Hyderabad?

317
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,600
Yes, but I am here now.

318
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,760
Close to you.

319
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,120
And your boss, Fernandez Sir
knows nothing about it.

320
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,960
-Come on. Come here. Where are you going?
-Stay away from me, Sasya.

321
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,920
Go, run.

322
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,720
The more you try to escape,
the more warmed up I get.

323
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,560
And the harder I'll come for you

324
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,440
A damp squib.

325
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,480
You called me a damp squib.

326
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,720
I'll show you my strength.

327
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:52,960
A woman... you tried to dominate me?

328
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,360
You wanted to overpower Sasya?

329
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:04,800
I put in so much efforts to get you
out of interrogation room and here.

330
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,480
I said that Nayakudu was impotent.

331
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,400
But that's not true.

332
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,080
He is exactly like me.

333
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,160
If he gets a chance, he will mount you.

334
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,800
Like how I'm going to mount you... now.

335
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,600
Does Nayak know...
that you became a police witness?

336
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,480
Everything is good
between me and Nayakudu.

337
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,880
He himself called me here,

338
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,400
told me that there's a girl in his room

339
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,360
and he was going out for a day.

340
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,400
He told me,
"Sasya, brother look into it...

341
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,120
do something so that the girl
can never open her mouth."

342
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,080
But why will you open your mouth?

343
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:55,040
I am going to kill the scorpion
inside you... on this bed tonight.

344
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:59,320
I'm going to take my revenge
from you all night...

345
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,440
N... Nayakudu...

346
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,480
You... Nayakudu, before you do anything,
please hear me out just once.

347
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,840
{\an8}Listen to me just once. I can...

348
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,920
I'm sorry... sorry...

349
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,720
There's not even a little fire inside you.

350
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,440
Bhumi isn't a woman.

351
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,440
Your looks are quite ordinary. Body too.

352
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,360
Has it been too long since you had sex?

353
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,760
The scorpion inside you is real.

354
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,440
You are not a woman.

355
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,880
You're a man.

356
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,000
There's not even a little fire...

357
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,000
Bhumi isn't...

358
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,520
<i>Has it been too long...</i>

359
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,120
The scorpion inside you is real.

360
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,680
Sasya has not sent me here.

361
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,440
I am a cop.

362
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,640
I know everything about your operation.

363
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:46,640
I am the only one
in the entire department...

364
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,120
whom Sasya told everything.

365
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,000
He told me every single thing.

366
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,560
You can do whatever you want with me.

367
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,760
I cannot change your mind.

368
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,960
But I have an offer for you.

369
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,680
Nayak... look carefully at me.

370
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,360
This is me talking to you.

371
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,000
Sasya is dead!

372
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,560
I will take Sasya's place for you.

373
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,000
I will give you all the information
that Sasya told the police.

374
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,640
I will give you his testimony.

375
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,960
If I do... what I'm promising you now,

376
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:43,480
if I am of any use to you,
you give me money or whatever you want.

377
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,760
This is my offer to you.

378
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,360
Accept it,
or else slit me with your sword.

379
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,080
Do as you please.

380
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,960
Whatever you feel is right.

381
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,760
You do it.

382
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,160
Whatever you feel is right.

383
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,240
I told you,

384
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,000
I will never hurt you.
