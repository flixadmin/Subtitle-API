1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,487
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,965
After five years in hell,
I have come home with only one goal:

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,004
To save my city.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,687
Now others have joined my crusade.

5
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,842
To them, I'm Oliver Queen.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,083
To the rest of Starling City,
I'm someone else...

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,369
...I am something else.

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,167
Previously on Arrow:

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,721
I'm going to find whoever did this.

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,402
There's something about Malcolm
that both you and Oliver need to know.

11
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,761
Malcolm...

12
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,927
I don't wanna hurt or get hurt.

13
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,287
You seem like someone
who could teach me not to.

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,363
You're my family, I need you.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,445
Looks like you're going home.

16
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,125
Thea seem different to you?

17
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,086
Where is she?

18
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,566
Where is Sara?

19
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,766
She came here for the League
two weeks ago.

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,763
We've not heard from her since.

21
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,204
There's something I have to tell you.

22
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,649
Sara's dead?

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,443
I'm so sorry.

24
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,284
It was an arrow, wasn't it?

25
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,481
How do you know that?

26
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,727
Where's her body?

27
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,722
- Nyssa.
- Where?

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,367
We buried her in her grave
from seven years ago.

29
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,681
She knows something.

30
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,846
I want you to follow her. But be careful.

31
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,005
I have to meet Thea.

32
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,330
Hi.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,161
Sorry I'm late.

34
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,845
Late is your "on time," Ollie.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,004
So much for my promise
that things would be different, right?

36
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,161
Relax. It's fine.

37
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,651
Dinner is on me.

38
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,847
With what money?

39
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,009
Aren't you broke?

40
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,810
Um...

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,402
- Aren't you?
- Not so much, actually.

42
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,326
Uh, when I decided to come back,
I had no idea what I wanted to do...

43
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,687
...and realized I kind of missed the club.

44
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,606
And turns out, a lot of
other people do too.

45
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,250
I have investors.

46
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,121
And, uh, they're gonna help me buy back
the foundry from Queen Consolidated.

47
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,362
I'm thrilled for you. That's fantastic.

48
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,243
You seem changed.

49
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,450
Stronger.

50
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,404
After last year, I...

51
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,889
- ...don't see any other way I could've turned out.
- And that's it?

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,810
You're not seeing someone or...?

53
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,721
I'm hoping Roy didn't put you up
to asking that.

54
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,690
No, I'm just trying to figure out
why you're so different.

55
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,966
How about just being
my big brother instead?

56
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,645
Okay.

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,402
Target's on the move. He's headed north.

58
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,323
- He stopped.
- What's he doing?

59
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,727
He's buying ice cream.

60
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,123
He doesn't look like a terrorist.

61
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,887
- The best ones never do.
- Why does Waller want me to take this guy out?

62
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,364
Too many questions.
Follow orders and eliminate the target.

63
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,090
Or is this one of your best friends too?

64
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,205
Oh, so I'm just a gun that she can point
at things she doesn't like?

65
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,885
That's exactly what you are.

66
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,528
- He's moving.
- Best not to waste time, then.

67
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,927
Nyssa.

68
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,250
You have my condolences.
And that of my father, Ra's al Ghul.

69
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,529
I don't want your condolences.

70
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,206
And I definitely don't want your father's.

71
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,810
She died with arrows in her chest.

72
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,486
You think that would've happened
if she hadn't met you?

73
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,766
You were the one
that showed her the darkness inside.

74
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,491
You and your father.

75
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,563
I know you grieve.

76
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,120
But so do I.

77
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,849
I didn't show Sara the darkness, Laurel.

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,480
It was already inside of her when we met.

79
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:20,569
When I found her, alone, starving
and terrified, I protected her.

80
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,009
I took Sara into my heart
and I loved her with all of my soul.

81
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,488
And that jacket...

82
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,325
...I gave it to Sara as a gift.

83
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,081
You are not fit to wear it.

84
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,848
- She's moving.
- Where?

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,490
She went to visit Sara's grave.

86
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,120
Now she's on the top floor
of some dump on Amsterdam.

87
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,324
Could be where she's crashing.
League's safe house or something.

88
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,845
Text me the address.

89
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,446
Are you ready to talk?

90
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,640
We've nothing to discuss.

91
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,330
The trail for Sara's killer has gone cold.

92
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,931
And I could use your help.

93
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,360
Whereas I don't need yours.

94
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,249
Really?

95
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,449
We've gathered evidence,
we're working leads.

96
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,729
You're visiting cemeteries
and hiding in League safe houses.

97
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,161
I am not hiding.

98
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,051
And this is not my safe house.
It was Sara's while she was in Starling.

99
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,122
These were her favorites.

100
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,685
Okay.

101
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,129
You said Sara was in Starling
for the League.

102
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,966
- That suggests her target is also her killer.
- Agreed.

103
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,122
Except it wasn't a target.

104
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,362
Sara came to Starling to confirm rumors.

105
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,727
Whispers,
that an enemy of the League was here.

106
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,089
- Who?
- Malcolm Merlyn.

107
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,207
He's alive.

108
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,801
Merlyn was a member
of the League of Assassins.

109
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,327
My father released him
from his obligation to us...

110
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,962
...with the understanding
he would abide by its code of conduct.

111
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,448
You guys are professional killers.

112
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,523
That is a pretty low bar.

113
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,809
Merlyn's undertaking
violated the League's principles.

114
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,131
When you killed him,
we considered the matter settled.

115
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,682
But we received word from a reliable source
that Merlyn faked his demise.

116
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,929
- What source?
- Oliver's mother.

117
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,446
Yeah, well, Oliver's mom
wasn't exactly known for her honesty.

118
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:22,043
No offense. I just can't believe that a guy
everyone thinks was dead suddenly isn't.

119
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,202
Neither did I.

120
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,005
Then we found these.

121
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,084
Sara took them two weeks ago.

122
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,042
Didn't the police find his body?

123
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,163
Merlyn had resources all over Starling.

124
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,085
I'm willing to bet one of them
was in the coroner's office.

125
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:46,041
Since learning Merlyn was alive, the
League has hunted him all over the globe.

126
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,642
Running down every rumor,
following every whisper.

127
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,366
And one of those whispers
put Merlyn back in Starling.

128
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,686
She tracked him here.

129
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,609
We're gonna retrace her steps.

130
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,280
- You said you found evidence on her person?
- Yes. Roy.

131
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,841
We found a blank piece of paper
in Sara's boot.

132
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,401
But why would she be carrying
a blank piece of paper?

133
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,804
Do you have a flame?

134
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,930
Unbelievable.

135
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,925
My father had a notebook
with hidden writing just like this.

136
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,970
A notebook he received from Merlyn,
I imagine.

137
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,767
This is ghost ink, one of the means
the League employs for concealing secrets.

138
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,331
It's Sara's handwriting.

139
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,562
Notes from her surveillance of Merlyn.

140
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,610
- There's not much to go on here.
- There's a couple of things.

141
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,444
"Jansen," question mark.

142
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,681
"Dad help," question mark.

143
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,326
Sara reached out to Lance.

144
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,608
If Lance knew Merlyn was alive,
he would've told you.

145
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,205
Only if she told him.

146
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,166
- What matters is what he told her.
- And how do we find that out?

147
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,045
So, gentlemen, word of advice.

148
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,966
Next time you arrest a bookie, please make
sure the chief is not one of his clients.

149
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,529
That's what the chief told me to tell you. As
far as I'm concerned, keep doing yourjobs.

150
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,763
First round tonight's on me.
Please get out of here.

151
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,321
- Buying rounds?
- Oh, buying love.

152
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,051
Fastest way to a cop's heart,
through his liver.

153
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,725
How are you feeling?

154
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,684
I'm fine. Do you have a minute?

155
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,202
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I have to talk to you.

156
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,887
It's about Sara. She, um...

157
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,246
She called me.

158
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,528
She said that she was looking
into something.

159
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,284
Something called Jansen?

160
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,370
Um...

161
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,882
Uh, yeah, someone.

162
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,849
Ken Zhi Jansen.

163
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,561
I hooked her up with his last
known address. Sara was here.

164
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,244
She asked me not to say anything to you,
and I... I should have.

165
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,289
Maybe I should have. I'm sorry.

166
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,205
It's okay. She was...

167
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,642
- She's in a mysterious line of work.
- Oh, yeah.

168
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,446
- One I hope you're not getting mixed up with.
- No.

169
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,170
I'm just doing Sara a favor.

170
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,287
And her?

171
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,200
I'll be right back.

172
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,968
What are you doing here?

173
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,409
Oliver told me of his plan to involve you
in the hunt for Sara's killer.

174
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,130
I have a handle on it.

175
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,049
Your father doesn't know, does he?

176
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,083
No, he doesn't.

177
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,040
- And he can't, he has a heart condition.
- He has the right to avenge his daughter.

178
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,204
- It's none of your business.
- Sara was everything I hold dear in this life.

179
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,762
- It is every bit my business.
- What would she say if she were here?

180
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,930
I almost didn't recognize you
without your Halloween costume.

181
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,007
Sara back in town too?

182
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,322
No, she is not.

183
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,963
But she told me to tell you
that she misses you very much.

184
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,163
The address I gave your sister for Jansen.

185
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,603
Now, she promised me there wouldn't be any,
you know, assassinating.

186
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,000
That still the case?

187
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,688
I assure you, Mr. Lance,
the only objective here is justice.

188
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,447
This was the next lead
Sara was gonna follow?

189
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,204
Jansen's a Buddhist monk.

190
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,840
Nine years ago,
he was facing deportation to China.

191
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,604
Merlyn bankrolled his defense.

192
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,690
Jansen returns the favor
by giving Merlyn asylum in his garden.

193
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:32,208
Monastery. We should divide our forces,
take up flanking positions.

194
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,442
I agree. But not...

195
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,331
Never understood
what Sara saw in her in the first place.

196
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,528
Split up. But be careful.

197
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,886
Copy that.

198
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,927
Oliver, we found Jansen.

199
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,801
Negative.

200
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,361
I have eyes on him.

201
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,490
Whoever is up there is not Jansen.

202
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,440
Jansen Sensei.

203
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,604
I am Nyssa, daughter of Ra's al Ghul,
heir to the Demon.

204
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,287
You will tell me where I can find Merlyn
or I will kill you where you sit.

205
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,330
Hello, Nyssa.

206
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,565
Where is he?

207
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,811
What's going on?

208
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,042
Did you find Sara's killer?

209
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,885
We have a suspect.

210
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,525
Malcolm Merlyn is alive.

211
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,407
Sara was here looking for him.

212
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,609
We think he found her first.

213
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,161
- And where is he now?
- We're working on that.

214
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,527
He got away from us earlier tonight.

215
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:14,646
But not before I hit him with an arrow
laced with particulate nanotechnology.

216
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,441
Felicity wrote a program
that tracks the nanites using GPS.

217
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,244
- A tracer arrow.
- Yeah.

218
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,521
You had a shot at Merlyn
and you didn't kill him?

219
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,411
- I tagged him.
- With a flesh wound.

220
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,086
He's marked.

221
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,040
Nowhere in the world he can go
where I can't find him.

222
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,480
And when you do?

223
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,407
- I'm not a killer anymore, Laurel.
- Merlyn is.

224
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:41,565
He killed Tommy
and 502 other innocent people.

225
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,521
How many are gonna have to die
before you put him down?

226
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,684
- You think that's what your sister would want?
- Yes.

227
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,291
I do.

228
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,961
Let me speak with her.

229
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,091
- Merlyn may try to contact Thea.
- I'm on it.

230
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,565
The tracer arrow program.

231
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,569
You have Felicity monitoring remote
from Central City?

232
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,722
No, she told me an idiot could run it.

233
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,130
I will try very hard
not to take that personally.

234
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,640
I'll be on the streets.

235
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,406
- Talk me in when you have his location.
- Copy that.

236
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,524
It's done.

237
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,487
Laurel.

238
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,281
I just found out Malcolm Merlyn isn't
only alive, but that he killed my sister.

239
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,284
I'm sure you can understand
why I don't wanna talk right now.

240
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,329
I understand.

241
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,486
I loved her too.

242
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,644
I'm sorry for your loss.

243
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,881
I promised Sara...

244
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,008
...and I promise you...

245
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,083
...we will find Malcolm Merlyn.

246
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,041
Apparently, you already did.

247
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,004
And Oliver should've killed him.

248
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,207
Yes.

249
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:37,727
If Oliver catches up with Merlyn,
he's going to let him live or let him go.

250
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,767
You can't let that happen.

251
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,482
You need to get Merlyn.

252
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,722
You have to do whatever it takes.

253
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,566
Hey.

254
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,286
Grand re-opening
is not for another three weeks.

255
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,408
Looks like you still got
a lot more work to do.

256
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,041
Need some help?

257
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,329
Uh, thanks, but I don't really think
that's a good idea.

258
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,491
Just as friends and former co-workers.

259
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:21,126
Bonsai green, October mist, or avocado?

260
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,211
- Merlyn stopped. I got his position.
- Go.

261
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:34,161
Air-conditioner factory, 18th and Milson.
You want me to share this with Nyssa?

262
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,130
No. She'll put an arrow in him
before I get any answers.

263
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,327
Agreed.

264
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,486
This place is empty.
He's not here, Diggle.

265
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,961
Hello, Oliver. You're absolutely right.

266
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,205
I'm not at the...
What is it, the air-conditioning factory?

267
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:00,085
It's a neat trick you have.
Sorry it didn't work out.

268
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,406
When I find y0u...

269
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,404
You absolutely will. We need to talk.

270
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,530
But I prefer a venue less conducive
to conflict.

271
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,524
Nelson Plaza at Goldwater and Fifth.
Bottom of the stairs.

272
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,489
It's a very public place.

273
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,324
You'll wanna leave your mask behind.

274
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,890
This should remain between the two of us.

275
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:22,490
So if I even see one of your associates,
I promise you, you will not see me.

276
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,170
Hello, Oliver. How are you?

277
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,124
You've accomplished a lot with this city,
I see.

278
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,169
I'm not here to discuss Starling.

279
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,449
- You think I killed Sara Lance.
- How else would you know she's dead?

280
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:59,407
These streets were mine
long before you laid claim to them.

281
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,801
This is still my city.

282
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,010
I chose this place
because crowds equal invisibility.

283
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,642
Besides, I understand
you're not killing people these days.

284
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,404
I'm considering making an exception.

285
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,809
Ra's al Ghul has placed
a blood bounty on my head.

286
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:18,364
Why would I try to get it lifted by killing the
love of his daughter's life? It's illogical.

287
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,568
Sara comes back to Starling.

288
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,883
You come back to Starling.
Sara's murdered.

289
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:28,284
I came back for the simplest
Thea.

290
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,489
Six months ago, during the siege...

291
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,168
...she was almost killed by one of...
One of Slade Wilson's Mirakuru soldiers.

292
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,051
- I protected her.
- You're lying.

293
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,248
Thea made it out before the attack.

294
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,925
Unfortunately, she didn't make it out.

295
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,526
But you wouldn't know that
because you were out being...

296
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,724
What are you calling yourself these days?
"The Arrow."

297
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,528
That was the night I realized
that Thea needs me.

298
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,886
Stay away from her.

299
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,050
Don't worry.

300
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,601
I've kept my distance.

301
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,850
Oh. But the world is a dangerous place.

302
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,681
And you're too distracted to protect her.

303
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,808
- You're a killer.
- Yes, I am.

304
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,761
But I swear, I swear to
you on Thea's life...

305
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:17,084
...I am not Sara Lance's killer.

306
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:36,164
From the look on your face,
you need something stronger than coffee.

307
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,802
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, are you?

308
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:44,090
Back in Corto Maltese, I promised you
there would be no more secrets...

309
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,361
...no more lies.

310
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,211
And I'm trying to honor that.

311
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,442
Okay.

312
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,166
I learned something last night
that's gonna be difficult for you to hear.

313
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:03,211
I think that it's what Mom was trying to
tell us the night she died, right before it.

314
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,209
The night of the siege,
you were at the train station.

315
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,443
Yeah, l...

316
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,165
It wasn't fun.

317
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,847
I got attacked
by one of those crazy masked things...

318
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,162
...and he tried to strangle me.

319
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,402
But he got shot by a cop, I think.

320
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,681
Did you see him?

321
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,090
No.

322
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,480
Why are you asking?

323
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,721
It wasn't a cop, Thea.

324
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,089
It was Malcolm Merlyn.

325
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,364
He's dead.

326
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,251
How do you know this?

327
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,562
One of Sara's friends saw him.

328
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,566
She's sure.

329
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:56,686
If he was gonna try to contact you,
he would've done it by now, okay?

330
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,730
Thank you for telling me.

331
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:06,205
It's, uh, one of my investors. I...

332
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,042
Are you okay?

333
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,683
Yeah. I'm... I'm fine. l...

334
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:17,127
It's like you said,
if he was gonna contact me...

335
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,169
...he probably would've done it by now.

336
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,289
- Where's Oliver?
- Out, taking care of some family business.

337
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,408
As if there weren't more pressing matters
at hand.

338
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,444
He's not doing nothing.
He tracked down Merlyn last night.

339
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,290
Did he kill him?

340
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,766
No.

341
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,166
- He swore to me he didn't kill Sara.
- And you know all of his words are lies.

342
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,407
I believe him.

343
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,287
Because he swore to me
on his daughter's life.

344
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,482
We had heard rumors
Merlyn fathered another child.

345
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,002
We couldn't confirm them.

346
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,922
- You know who it is.
- I do.

347
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,251
If you put me through the effort
of finding out on my own...

348
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:17,007
...I might have to exact a price
from whoever it is you're protecting.

349
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,524
It's Thea.
My sister is Merlyn's daughter.

350
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,608
And that is the reason
he came back to Starling City.

351
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,125
Because she did.

352
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,526
He's protecting her.

353
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,924
And that is why you spared Merlyn, twice.

354
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,650
It had nothing to do with that.

355
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:43,764
He explained to me, in his own twisted way,
that he loves her.

356
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,641
And then he swore to me on her life.

357
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:51,601
And I swore an oath of my own that I would
see Sara's killer brought to justice.

358
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,881
Nyssa.

359
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,122
- Nyssa!
- Oliver, wait.

360
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,009
- We have to stop her.
- Do we?

361
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,642
Listen, I understand why you can't
kill Merlyn, all of the reasons.

362
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,162
- Maybe he killed Sara, maybe he didn't.
- He didn't.

363
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,564
Either way, the world is a better place
without Malcolm Merlyn in it.

364
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,405
You made a vow not to kill.

365
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,280
Nyssa didn't.

366
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,731
Where's your wife?

367
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,565
Tatsu? She needed to be someplace else.

368
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,563
She doesn't like me.

369
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,921
You're wrong.

370
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,161
She hates you.

371
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,321
She's not happy that I'm here.

372
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,561
Neither am I.

373
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,801
I killed a man today.

374
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,250
I don't even know the reason.

375
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:47,888
- Sometimes it's better that way.
- What, blindly following orders is better?

376
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,088
I'm not blind, Oliver.

377
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,443
I'm focused on what's most important.

378
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,451
You should do the same.

379
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,850
It's not our place or burden
to know why we carry out our missions.

380
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,571
I didn't realize having a conscience
was a burden.

381
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,090
What are you playing?

382
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,287
A reading game.

383
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,090
Oh, yeah? Do you mind if I try?

384
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,049
I wanna work on my Cantonese.

385
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,248
Dad said I shouldn't let you
use my computer.

386
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,290
Okay. Why don't we make a deal, then?

387
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,442
You don't have anything. You're a burn.

388
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,964
Well, this bum has something
that you don't have.

389
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,884
Height.

390
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:38,489
That stash of candy that your parents keep
in the cupboard above the fridge?

391
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,647
- I'll swipe you two pieces.
- Five.

392
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,888
- Three.
- Five.

393
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,969
Fine, five. Give me the computer.

394
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,850
I need a meet with Waller.

395
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,490
- How did you...? Akio...
- it's not his fault.

396
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,648
I need a meet, make it happen.

397
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,964
- Wailer's gonna want a reason.
- Ferris Air flight 637.

398
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,849
She'll know what I mean.

399
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,330
Thanks for your help.
You really didn't have to do that.

400
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:16,081
I like painting.
Actually, it helps me turn my brain off.

401
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,004
It feels kind of Zen.

402
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,606
Actually, I wish you were
still trying to get into my pants...

403
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:25,641
...because this "Zen, helpful Roy" thing
is really freaking me out.

404
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,680
Get away from him.

405
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,850
- I'm not here for him.
- Thea.

406
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,050
Thea. Thea, are you here?

407
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,726
So Malcolm Merlyn is alive
and Thea's father.

408
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,604
Anything else you haven't told me?

409
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,570
- What'd you get at the precinct?
- Not much.

410
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,882
But I did get this off a traffic camera.

411
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,202
It was recorded 10 minutes ago.

412
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:28,410
After I struck out on anything related to
Nyssa or Thea, I just looked for strange.

413
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,251
Well, that definitely counts.

414
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,088
Sara, she never said much
about the League...

415
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:38,084
...but she said their communication system
was outdated.

416
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,811
- Smoke signal.
- Nyssa's sending Malcolm a message.

417
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,445
I'm willing to bet my wallet...

418
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,321
...that means "we got your daughter."
Video gives me her location.

419
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:49,444
- You mean "us," right?
- No, I need you to secure the perimeter.

420
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,648
- Can't risk Thea seeing you.
- Copy that.

421
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,970
She knows I know about the Arrow.

422
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,646
Not with a dose of League tranquilizer
in your system.

423
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,011
Oliver, this is my fault.

424
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,764
I told Nyssa to go after Merlyn.

425
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,491
- I told her to do whatever it takes.
- It's okay.

426
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,569
I know you're not a killer.

427
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,803
But he is.

428
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,169
Whatever else he means to you or Thea...

429
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,611
...know that.

430
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,607
I'm gonna get free of this
and when I do, I'm gonna kill you.

431
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,286
I apologize for involving you in this.

432
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,124
My quarrel's with your father.

433
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,489
My father's been dead for years,
you crazy psycho bitch.

434
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,641
Not Robert Queen.

435
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,805
Your true father, al-Saher, the magician.

436
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,201
Known to the uninitiated
as Malcolm Merlyn.

437
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,045
Then you know what he's gonna do to you
when he gets here.

438
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,326
I know he'll die.

439
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,484
My father taught me ways to cut a man
to make his death last for days.

440
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:54,729
- Sounds like father of the year.
- My father may be the Demon...

441
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,165
...but yours is the devil.

442
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,610
Run!

443
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,731
Apparently, we both
handle grief differently.

444
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,929
There's a misunderstanding
the three of us need to clear up.

445
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,522
A conversation I'm eager to have
over your rotting corpse.

446
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,440
Do it, Oliver.

447
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,280
He killed Sara...

448
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,646
...Tommy.

449
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,804
He will corrupt your sister.

450
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,802
There is blood on my hands.

451
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,611
Almost too much to contemplate.

452
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,890
But none of it is Sara's.

453
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,446
Kill him!

454
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,965
I did not kill your beloved!

455
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,723
Your father doubted Sara's loyalties
the moment you brought her home.

456
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,211
You know your father,
what he is capable of.

457
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,921
He will kill without hesitation.

458
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,844
Do you really need me to tell you...

459
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,129
...what he'd do to the degenerate
who'd steal his daughter's heart?

460
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,486
Nyssa doesn't believe me, Oliver.

461
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,007
If you don't believe me...

462
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,448
...listen to her.

463
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,651
Kill me.

464
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,523
You may not have killed Sara...

465
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,683
...but you're still a murderer.

466
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,490
What are you gonna do?

467
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,011
Arrest me?

468
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:43,846
I could have S.C.P.D. here
in three minutes.

469
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,527
And in half that time, I will escape
from whatever prison they put me in.

470
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,489
You know that, so does she.

471
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,531
We were trained by the League,
no prison can hold us!

472
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,681
Not even your one on Lian Yu.

473
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:03,088
Which leaves you with only one option.

474
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,522
To break your vows...

475
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,607
...and kill me.

476
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,806
Kill your sister's father.

477
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,890
- Is Thea okay?
- I spoke to her.

478
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,725
She's fine.
Doesn't know who took her or why.

479
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,051
I may have deserved that.

480
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,049
You deserve worse.

481
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,486
Um, what's going on?

482
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,291
Merlyn didn't kill Sara.

483
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,408
Which means whoever did
is still out there.

484
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,082
You're a fool...

485
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,242
...who insults the memory of a woman
he once loved.

486
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:58,406
I will honor Sara's memory by finding
and punishing the person who did this.

487
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,081
The real person.

488
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,490
Nyssa.

489
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:09,608
So long as Malcolm Merlyn is in my city,
the League will make no move on him.

490
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,969
He's under my protection.

491
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,687
You would incur the wrath
of the League of Assassins?

492
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:20,603
I would do what I have to
in order to buy the time necessary...

493
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,206
...to find out what really happened
with Sara.

494
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,607
You have made an enemy tonight.

495
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,606
One with a long memory.

496
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,125
Oliver.

497
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,887
Are you sure?

498
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,202
If I wasn't sure,
I never would have let him go.

499
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,131
- I promise.
- What did I miss?

500
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,884
I hate Hong Kong.

501
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,849
And I hate trans-Pacific flights.

502
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,961
And do not even get me started on the topic
of being summoned by one of my operatives.

503
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,647
Ferris Air flight 637,
Paris to Hong Kong nonstop.

504
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,326
You prevented that flight
from being shot down over Lian Yu.

505
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,324
- Were you watching me?
- Via Keyhole Hexagon satellite.

506
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:11,804
How else was I supposed to know
you possess the capabilities I require?

507
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,368
That business with the freighter last year.

508
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,642
Impressive. Are we done?

509
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:21,322
Just getting started, actually.
Adam Castwidth.

510
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,366
The man you had me murder.

511
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,851
He was Edward Fyers' handler.

512
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,004
- And he worked for you.
- You're out of your depth, Mr. Queen.

513
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,207
I don't think that I am.

514
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,210
I think Mr. Castwidth had a USB drive
detailing everything.

515
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,846
I think he knew you told Fyers
to shoot the plane down.

516
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,528
- And I think that you wanted him silenced.
- And the world thinks you dead, Mr. Queen.

517
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,886
The convenient thing about dead men
is that no one tends to believe them.

518
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:50,846
What about dead men who make arrangements
to get the information on that USB drive...

519
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,964
...in the hands of every blogger
and journalist in this hemisphere?

520
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,088
If anything happens to Maseo's family...

521
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,040
...you're gonna spend a long time testifying
in front of the Senate subcommittee.

522
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:05,161
The world's a much more complicated place
than you realize.

523
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:11,051
Edward Fyers thought he was to shoot down that
plane to destabilize the Chinese economy.

524
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,087
In truth, I wanted to
take out a single target.

525
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:19,087
So you blow up a plane full of
innocent people to take out one man?

526
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,568
No, to take out one woman.

527
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,280
Chien Na Wei.

528
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,088
Two years ago,
we had our only chance at her.

529
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,568
And you saved her life.

530
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,930
And now she's in Hong Kong.
I need to know why.

531
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,528
I thought you were going back
to your father.

532
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,007
I felt I owed you a goodbye.

533
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,925
I intend to make good on my promise
to Sara.

534
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,605
And to you.

535
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,566
It kills me that he's still out there.

536
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,445
Merlyn.

537
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,284
Someone.

538
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,407
It kills me.

539
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,206
It pains me as well.

540
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,362
I see you've been training.

541
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,766
And wearing her jacket.

542
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,531
If you're gonna stand there and tell me
I'm not strong enough...

543
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,604
...please don't.

544
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,689
Back at the cemetery, I would have.

545
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:29,288
But since, you've reminded me that the
strongest metal is forged in the hottest fire.

546
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,090
And what's that supposed to mean?

547
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,881
Don't forget to turn your hips.

548
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,087
It's where the power comes from.

549
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,523
It's Sara, leave a message.

550
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,081
Sara, sweetie, it's, uh...

551
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,449
It's me. Look, I... I know you said
only call this number in an emergency.

552
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:59,047
And it's not, it's not, everything is fine.
But I just...

553
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,324
I just wanna hear your voice.

554
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,967
I know wherever you are,
you're looking after yourself...

555
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,248
...but, you know,
that doesn't mean I don't worry.

556
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,561
So, you know...

557
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,762
Don't... No need to call me back
or anything.

558
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,002
I just want you to remember...

559
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,690
...that I love you.

560
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,526
Are you okay?

561
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,523
It's not my first time being kidnapped.

562
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:34,127
It's not what I meant.
I never imagined you and scrubbing.

563
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,089
Unless a spa treatment was involved.

564
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,566
I spoke to Detective Lance.

565
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,041
He doesn't think that woman
is gonna bother you again.

566
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,885
Why did she come after me
in the first place?

567
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,646
Maybe she thought
the Queens still had money.

568
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,561
I Wish.

569
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:53,366
But thank you for checking in on me.

570
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,927
I'm always gonna watch out for you.

571
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,206
Always.

572
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,045
Sorry, guys, I didn't mean to interrupt.

573
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,884
I was just leaving.

574
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,883
Take care of yourself.

575
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,726
- I thought you had guys for that.
- It's kind of Zen.

576
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,282
You got that same worried look on your face
my brother had.

577
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,488
Really, I'm fine.

578
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,645
Good.

579
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,087
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.

580
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,402
And I wanted to apologize.

581
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,925
I'm sorry I couldn't stop her.

582
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,010
You tried. Really.

583
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,402
Those were some nice moves back there.

584
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,646
Whatever you're doing with the Arrow
is clearly paying off.

585
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,363
Maybe I should apply for a job here
as one of your bouncers.

586
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,602
I think I got that covered.

587
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,446
But I could use an assistant manager.

588
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,367
For real?

589
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,966
I need somebody who knows the place
as well as I do.

590
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,201
Absolutely.

591
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:02,284
- Purely platonic.
- Understood.

592
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,884
Oh, it's my designer, Kurt.

593
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,451
I should probably take this.

594
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,480
- Hi.
- Are you safe?

595
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,805
I am now.

596
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,011
- Is that woman gone?
- For now.

597
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,811
- And your brother?
- He's completely in the dark.

598
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,803
He doesn't know a thing.

599
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,804
But thank you, Dad.

600
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,485
For what?

601
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,485
For taking care of me.

602
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,962
I promised you, Thea...

603
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:37,209
...I will never let anyone hurt you.

604
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,322
The rumors were true.

605
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,768
Malcolm Merlyn is in Starling City.

606
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,851
There is a sadness in your voice.

607
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,162
Ta-er al-Sahfer.

608
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,726
She has fallen.

609
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,848
Sara Lance is dead?

610
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,445
Yes.

611
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,728
Struck through the heart with an arrow.

612
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,368
At Merlyn's hand?

613
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,010
It appears.

614
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,370
I have vowed a blood oath to avenge her.

615
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,251
Al-Saher will face the League's justice.

616
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,606
But for his crimes against our code.

617
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:33,208
- But Sara...?
- Was never truly one of us.

618
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,049
What of Queen?

619
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:41,407
He has sworn to protect Merlyn at any cost.

620
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,929
If that is true...

621
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:47,687
...then Oliver Queen courts war with us.
