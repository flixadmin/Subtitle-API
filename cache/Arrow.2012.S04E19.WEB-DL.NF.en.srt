You'd blame me too if you knew the truth.

-Yeah.

634
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:18,068
There was a time
I would have thought this was my fault.

635
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:21,071
That I brought this darkness upon us.

636
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:23,073
Now I know it's not my fault.

637
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:24,992
It's my responsibility.

638
00:37:25,075 --> 00:37:27,077
Responsibility to do what?

639
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:28,704
To end it.

640
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:31,249
I'm gonna kill him.

641
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,792
Is there anything I can do?

642
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,295
I wanna be left alone.

643
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,685
Are you okay?

644
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:36,564
Are you?

645
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:41,736
(SLOWLY) No.

646
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:45,406
You know what you have to do, right?

647
00:38:47,282 --> 00:38:48,951
You have to kill this son of a bitch.

648
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:51,871
I know.

649
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,916
I don't know how.

650
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,586
Because of his magic.

651
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:00,921
His ma... It's too strong.

652
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:05,676
I've seen it before,

653
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,553
back on Lian Yu,

654
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:11,181
and it is not just magic.

655
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,060
It's darkness.

656
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:19,482
And whenever I have come up against it,
I have gone nowhere.

657
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:21,359
It...

658
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:25,195
He feels unstoppable.

659
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,072
I refuse to believe that.

660
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,661
And I refuse to let you believe that.

661
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,414
If Darhk wins, Laurel died for nothing.

662
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:39,794
I fell in love with you for many reasons
and one of those reasons is,

663
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:42,129
is that you always find a way,

664
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,674
and you have to find a way now.

665
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:47,051
For Laurel,

666
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,719
for the city,

667
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:53,683
for all of us.

668
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,949
