1
00:00:19,368 --> 00:00:23,205
When the public
found out about the excessive lifestyle

2
00:00:23,414 --> 00:00:25,373
of the prisoners at La Catedral,

3
00:00:25,374 --> 00:00:29,502
the police began an investigation
into the supposed capital crimes

4
00:00:29,503 --> 00:00:32,672
being committed by Pablo Escobar
within the prison walls.

5
00:00:32,673 --> 00:00:36,927
The central part of this investigation
involves the disappearance

6
00:00:36,928 --> 00:00:38,972
of Gerardo Moncada and Fernando Galeano.

7
00:00:41,599 --> 00:00:43,892
- Agent Peña?
- What's this?

8
00:00:43,893 --> 00:00:45,394
It's from upstairs.

9
00:00:46,104 --> 00:00:47,647
Oh, I get a card.

10
00:00:49,356 --> 00:00:52,233
Oh, CIA.

11
00:00:52,234 --> 00:00:54,945
"Congratulations,
Central Intelligence Agency."

12
00:00:54,946 --> 00:00:58,239
This is, uh... this is blowing up
a little bit more than we expected, no?

13
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,158
Well, hopefully,
the son of a bitch rots in jail.

14
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:02,662
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
We gotta transfer him first.

15
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,247
- I forbade you to leak this.
- How do you know it was us?

16
00:01:05,456 --> 00:01:07,917
- Escobar has a lot of enemies.
- 'Course it was you.

17
00:01:08,126 --> 00:01:10,806
Whoever did this, it doesn't really
matter now. What's done is done.

18
00:01:10,878 --> 00:01:14,673
Ambassador, like you said, this is
a Colombian matter. What do we care?

19
00:01:14,674 --> 00:01:17,550
I'm filing a report with the
Board of Personal Conduct in Washington.

20
00:01:17,551 --> 00:01:19,470
- Ambassador...
- Good, report to Washington.

21
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:21,972
'Cause if something isn't done,
every American down here

22
00:01:21,973 --> 00:01:25,017
associated with the government
is gonna look like a fool, including you.

23
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:28,938
I wasn't finished. Until further notice,
you're both suspended.

24
00:01:29,147 --> 00:01:30,564
Go home.

25
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:34,652
MURDERS AT LA CATEDRAL?

26
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:39,114
Mr. President,
I just spoke with the attorney general.

27
00:01:39,115 --> 00:01:43,952
Moncada's wife reported
his disappearance from La Catedral.

28
00:01:43,953 --> 00:01:47,331
It's clear that Escobar
killed those men in that prison.

29
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:53,128
- I don't think he'd take it that far.
- Escobar is capable of anything.

30
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:56,214
But you know what?
This could be a good opportunity for us.

31
00:01:56,215 --> 00:01:57,466
Forgive me, Eduardo...

32
00:01:58,425 --> 00:02:02,388
but I'm having a hard time
finding the silver lining in all this.

33
00:02:03,931 --> 00:02:07,434
This is our opportunity
to end Pablo's vacation.

34
00:04:33,497 --> 00:04:35,624
- Boss.
- Good morning, boss.

35
00:04:47,303 --> 00:04:48,595
Ahh!

36
00:04:59,106 --> 00:05:00,316
Good morning, boss.

37
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,237
Bad news.

38
00:05:23,047 --> 00:05:25,132
Have the bodies disappeared?

39
00:05:37,103 --> 00:05:40,355
Our agreement with him states
he can't be moved to another prison.

40
00:05:40,356 --> 00:05:44,943
Excuse me, but killing people in prison
is a direct violation of our agreement.

41
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:46,987
Yes, yes,
but we have to tread carefully.

42
00:05:47,196 --> 00:05:50,408
If he feels we're violating his terms,

43
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:53,244
he'll start putting bombs
on street corners again.

44
00:05:53,451 --> 00:06:00,499
Let's tell him we've uncovered threats
against him from his biggest enemies.

45
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,795
That would give us the opportunity
to bring him to Bogotá

46
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:06,464
while we improve security
at La Catedral.

47
00:06:10,552 --> 00:06:13,179
The fourth brigade,
commanded by General Ariza,

48
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,515
would be the best choice
to carry out this operation.

49
00:06:15,724 --> 00:06:17,767
- Ariza?
- Yes, sir.

50
00:06:17,768 --> 00:06:20,645
- Is he from Medellín?
- Yes, sir.

51
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:21,688
Hm.

52
00:06:25,943 --> 00:06:28,321
Can we trust him?

53
00:06:28,528 --> 00:06:30,239
Yes, sir.

54
00:06:31,073 --> 00:06:32,158
Success.

55
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,080
Sure, it cost me a suspension,
but who cares?

56
00:06:38,914 --> 00:06:41,458
I just call it a week's paternity leave.

57
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:46,129
I was ready to crack a beer
and watch Escobar's endgame on TV.

58
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,756
See, because of me and Peña,

59
00:06:48,757 --> 00:06:52,135
the Colombian government
was sending in the army.

60
00:06:52,136 --> 00:06:54,680
Not the cops,
but the fucking army.

61
00:06:56,307 --> 00:07:00,018
There was no way that Escobar
was getting out of this one.

62
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:03,355
But, then again, in Colombia...

63
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:06,066
nothing goes down
the way you think it will.

64
00:07:39,975 --> 00:07:41,519
I'm calling him.

65
00:07:46,273 --> 00:07:49,360
Don Pablo, here...
Tata's on the phone.

66
00:07:54,073 --> 00:07:57,783
I was just thinking
there's nothing in the world I'd love more

67
00:07:57,784 --> 00:07:59,619
than to hear my wife's lovely voice.

68
00:07:59,828 --> 00:08:02,121
Pablo, what's happening?

69
00:08:02,122 --> 00:08:04,749
Why would something
be happening here?

70
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,918
The soldiers.

71
00:08:06,835 --> 00:08:08,211
Soldiers?

72
00:08:08,212 --> 00:08:12,298
Lots of them.
Headed to the prison right now.

73
00:08:12,299 --> 00:08:13,842
I don't know, Pablo.

74
00:08:15,553 --> 00:08:17,471
Tell me what's happening.

75
00:08:18,722 --> 00:08:21,349
No, my love, it's nothing.

76
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:23,018
Everything is cool.

77
00:08:26,813 --> 00:08:28,899
I'll call back soon, all right?

78
00:08:31,026 --> 00:08:32,945
I love you, baby.

79
00:08:35,072 --> 00:08:36,574
Yes, my love.

80
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,046
Get out the weapons.

81
00:08:52,047 --> 00:08:55,551
As you wish, sir.

82
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,953
Listen up, company!

83
00:09:23,954 --> 00:09:28,459
You will be under the command
of Lieutenant Dominguez.

84
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:31,961
Let's secure the perimeter.

85
00:09:31,962 --> 00:09:35,131
Tell your men
they have orders to shoot anyone

86
00:09:35,132 --> 00:09:39,428
- trying to leave the prison, understood?
- As you wish, General.

87
00:09:39,637 --> 00:09:40,679
Dismissed.

88
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:46,184
- Juan Pablo, where are you going?
- I'm going to the jail to help Dad.

89
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:48,811
- No, dear, you can't go there now.
- I said I want to go!

90
00:09:48,812 --> 00:09:52,607
- Juan Pablo, your father's fine.
- He needs you to stay here

91
00:09:52,608 --> 00:09:55,528
to look after your sister.
Isn't that what he always says?

92
00:09:55,735 --> 00:09:59,448
- But the soldiers are going to kill him.
- Don't ever say that in this house!

93
00:09:59,657 --> 00:10:01,450
- They're going to kill him!
- Quiet!

94
00:10:07,998 --> 00:10:11,000
The car was
outside the garage, still idling,

95
00:10:11,001 --> 00:10:12,335
the keys still in the ignition.

96
00:10:12,336 --> 00:10:15,296
- I've called his phone 20 times.
- Did you call embassy security?

97
00:10:15,297 --> 00:10:18,091
- No, I wanted to talk to you first.
- Good. Don't.

98
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,426
What? Why not?

99
00:10:20,427 --> 00:10:24,514
Nothing. I just... I don't wanna
ring any alarms before I check things out.

100
00:10:24,515 --> 00:10:27,017
- What are you guys up to?
- Connie...

101
00:10:28,143 --> 00:10:30,395
Just try to relax, OK?
I'm sure everything's fine.

102
00:10:30,396 --> 00:10:33,022
I'm gonna take care of this.

103
00:10:33,023 --> 00:10:37,235
I'll find out where he is, all right?

104
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:39,572
Look, I'll make you a drink.

105
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:53,459
Boss...

106
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,253
they're gonna
try to take you out of here

107
00:10:55,254 --> 00:10:58,339
and look for evidence
on Moncada and Galeano.

108
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,884
If I leave this place,
someone will kill me.

109
00:11:02,219 --> 00:11:06,515
Or the Americans will use their power to
restore extradition and send me to the US.

110
00:11:09,851 --> 00:11:12,562
What the fuck,
let's give those bastards lead.

111
00:11:12,563 --> 00:11:15,231
- Are you crazy?
- Yeah, we can take them, Don Pablo.

112
00:11:15,232 --> 00:11:17,025
For every one of our men,
they have 20!

113
00:11:17,234 --> 00:11:20,194
- Let's do it now.
- Don't be an idiot. Wait for the boss!

114
00:11:20,195 --> 00:11:22,906
Stop bickering in front of the boss.

115
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:25,325
We have the escape routes.

116
00:11:25,534 --> 00:11:28,870
We could get into the hills
before they even know we're gone.

117
00:11:36,503 --> 00:11:38,672
There is a time to fight...

118
00:11:39,923 --> 00:11:42,050
and there is a time to be clever.

119
00:11:42,926 --> 00:11:44,595
Yes, sir.

120
00:11:46,221 --> 00:11:50,057
- What's your plan?
- Let's talk to Gaviria.

121
00:11:50,058 --> 00:11:51,602
Be smart.

122
00:11:52,561 --> 00:11:55,731
Try to settle this matter peacefully.

123
00:11:58,734 --> 00:12:00,444
If that fails?

124
00:12:05,907 --> 00:12:07,700
What are you doing back here?

125
00:12:07,701 --> 00:12:10,621
- I forgot my socks.
- I want you out in five minutes.

126
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:16,751
Son of a bitch. These Colombians
are knee-deep in a shit storm.

127
00:12:16,752 --> 00:12:18,170
We gotta talk.

128
00:12:19,546 --> 00:12:20,838
Back here.

129
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,635
What? You get a hooker pregnant?

130
00:12:25,636 --> 00:12:27,804
I think Agent Murphy got snatched.

131
00:12:27,805 --> 00:12:30,306
I checked all area hospitals,
police stations.

132
00:12:30,307 --> 00:12:31,974
We were pursuing leads
on the Cali cartel.

133
00:12:31,975 --> 00:12:33,934
It could be related to that,
or it could be Escobar.

134
00:12:33,935 --> 00:12:35,894
Did you report it
to the Regional Security Office?

135
00:12:35,895 --> 00:12:38,022
If I tell the ROS,
it becomes a five-alarm fire,

136
00:12:38,023 --> 00:12:39,816
and whoever has him might panic.

137
00:12:39,817 --> 00:12:43,027
If it is Escobar,
he's dead already.

138
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:46,905
Well, can you check your sources?
See what comes up?

139
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:50,202
Jesus Christ.

140
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:52,705
Let me see what I can do.

141
00:12:56,249 --> 00:12:59,502
General Ariza
has orders to secure Escobar.

142
00:12:59,503 --> 00:13:03,715
I want you to go there
and legalize his transfer to Bogotá.

143
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:07,259
- What do you mean, "legalize" it?
- Formalize it.

144
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:10,012
You'll reiterate
that this is a temporary relocation

145
00:13:10,013 --> 00:13:13,265
while we renovate La Catedral
to make it safer for him.

146
00:13:13,266 --> 00:13:15,227
We both know that's not true.

147
00:13:16,102 --> 00:13:21,024
But it's what you'll tell Escobar
until he's safely inside a military brig.

148
00:13:21,941 --> 00:13:22,984
Yes, Mr. President.

149
00:13:24,152 --> 00:13:25,404
What's wrong?

150
00:13:29,157 --> 00:13:30,950
I've got a bad feeling about this.

151
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:34,620
Eduardo, I trust you...

152
00:13:34,621 --> 00:13:39,334
and this is too important to leave
to someone I don't trust completely.

153
00:13:42,962 --> 00:13:45,590
I'm at your service,
Mr. President.

154
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:47,508
You know that very well.

155
00:13:47,509 --> 00:13:51,555
Nothing will make me happier than to see
that asshole get the justice he deserves.

156
00:14:00,647 --> 00:14:04,983
Checked my sources with the Colombian
military. Nobody knows jack shit.

157
00:14:04,984 --> 00:14:08,529
So no indication Escobar had anything
to do with Murphy's disappearance?

158
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:09,690
It's time to sound the alarm.

159
00:14:10,866 --> 00:14:14,035
Just hold off for a couple of hours, OK?

160
00:14:14,994 --> 00:14:18,623
We call out the troops,
he ends up dead like Diana Turbay.

161
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:20,876
Thanks.

162
00:14:40,061 --> 00:14:42,939
Tell the boys in the comuna to stay quiet

163
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,149
until further notice, understand?

164
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:47,694
All right. What else do you have?

165
00:14:50,405 --> 00:14:51,948
- I know that.
- Velasco.

166
00:14:51,949 --> 00:14:53,533
I'll call you back.

167
00:14:54,743 --> 00:14:56,244
Yes, boss?

168
00:14:57,287 --> 00:14:59,122
What's happening outside?

169
00:15:01,249 --> 00:15:03,126
We don't know.

170
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:13,971
I fucked up.

171
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,264
What's that, boss?

172
00:15:19,142 --> 00:15:20,978
Gather the boys.

173
00:15:23,271 --> 00:15:27,609
And tell the prison guards they're
to fire on anyone who tries to come in.

174
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:33,699
Boss, do you think the prison guards
will follow your orders?

175
00:15:34,574 --> 00:15:37,661
They'd better. I hired them.

176
00:15:39,412 --> 00:15:43,457
Excuse me. Boss, the people
from Medellín just informed me

177
00:15:43,458 --> 00:15:47,004
that some guy named
Eduardo Sandoval is on his way.

178
00:15:49,006 --> 00:15:50,131
Mm.

179
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,077
Good evening.
Where is General Ariza?

180
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:22,204
General!

181
00:16:22,205 --> 00:16:24,415
Let him through.

182
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:26,251
Good evening, General.

183
00:16:28,086 --> 00:16:31,296
- Mr. Vice Minister.
- How are you?

184
00:16:31,297 --> 00:16:33,090
Pleasure to see you.
Good evening.

185
00:16:33,091 --> 00:16:37,219
- Where's Escobar?
- Escobar?

186
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:39,889
Inside the prison, obviously.

187
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:42,016
What do you mean,
he's in the prison?

188
00:16:42,017 --> 00:16:45,061
I thought you were taking him into custody
when you arrived.

189
00:16:45,062 --> 00:16:48,689
I'm sorry, sir,
but those were not my orders.

190
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:50,900
Then what were your orders?

191
00:16:50,901 --> 00:16:54,862
My orders were to secure the perimeter,
not let anyone in or out,

192
00:16:54,863 --> 00:16:56,573
and wait for you.

193
00:16:57,490 --> 00:16:59,784
That's not what the president believes.

194
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:03,287
He's not going to be happy
to hear Escobar isn't in your custody.

195
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:06,124
I'm sorry,
but those were my orders.

196
00:17:08,668 --> 00:17:14,007
I turned myself in to that punk...
the vice minister of justice.

197
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:20,429
But since there is
no justice in this country,

198
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,557
he is the vice minister of nothing.

199
00:17:27,228 --> 00:17:28,855
This is good.

200
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:33,234
Gaviria wants to negotiate with us.

201
00:17:37,363 --> 00:17:39,157
This is very good.

202
00:17:41,118 --> 00:17:45,037
General, I don't believe
you understand your orders clearly.

203
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:49,000
- But I do.
- Wait a second, sir, where are you going?

204
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,710
I'm going to try
to make a miracle happen.

205
00:17:51,711 --> 00:17:55,673
I'm going in there to convince Escobar
this is a temporary transfer of location.

206
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:59,384
And I'm also going to say
that I'm here to guarantee his safety.

207
00:17:59,385 --> 00:18:02,597
I can't allow you
to put yourself in danger.

208
00:18:03,473 --> 00:18:06,934
Do you think that Escobar is dumb enough
to kill the vice minister of justice

209
00:18:06,935 --> 00:18:11,523
right in front of the fourth brigade?
For God's sake.

210
00:18:12,231 --> 00:18:15,275
At least let me make a call
so they don't shoot you when you walk in!

211
00:18:15,276 --> 00:18:18,947
Make it fast. Open the door.
You two are coming with me.

212
00:18:21,199 --> 00:18:23,117
Didn't you hear me?
Open the door! General!

213
00:18:23,118 --> 00:18:25,703
Listen to the vice minister! Hurry up!

214
00:18:25,704 --> 00:18:26,872
Open it.

215
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:49,644
Vice Minister, good evening.

216
00:18:50,645 --> 00:18:53,398
Pablo is waiting for you. Go on.

217
00:18:55,734 --> 00:18:57,194
Wait here.

218
00:19:05,744 --> 00:19:07,871
Good evening, Vice Minister.

219
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,332
It's been a while.

220
00:19:15,212 --> 00:19:16,755
Good evening.

221
00:19:19,007 --> 00:19:22,218
I'm here on behalf of President Gaviria.

222
00:19:22,219 --> 00:19:25,180
My orders are to escort you
to a temporary prison in Bogotá.

223
00:19:25,388 --> 00:19:28,348
The government has decided to make
some improvements here at La Catedral

224
00:19:28,349 --> 00:19:30,809
for your safety
and everyone else's here.

225
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:31,937
Mm.

226
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:38,026
I would think Gaviria
could come up with a more believable lie.

227
00:19:40,737 --> 00:19:45,074
I know why you're here.
Because of Moncada and Galeano.

228
00:19:45,075 --> 00:19:47,535
But I didn't kill those men.
That story is a lie.

229
00:19:47,744 --> 00:19:51,623
And why should the government care
about some dispute between gangsters?

230
00:19:51,831 --> 00:19:53,540
We don't care about that.
You're mistaken.

231
00:19:53,541 --> 00:19:57,170
You are betraying me, Vice Minister.
Gaviria is betraying me.

232
00:19:57,378 --> 00:20:02,674
If your safety is a concern,
I will gladly escort you out myself.

233
00:20:02,675 --> 00:20:06,930
We have an agreement,
and you're breaking it.

234
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:09,932
What guarantee do I have
that the Americans won't kidnap me

235
00:20:09,933 --> 00:20:11,309
and take me to the US?

236
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,479
Bush would be very happy
to stick me in a gringo jail,

237
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,816
like he did to Lehder,
like he did to Noriega, right?

238
00:20:18,817 --> 00:20:20,776
That's not gonna happen,
you have my word.

239
00:20:20,777 --> 00:20:22,320
- Your word.
- Mm.

240
00:20:24,906 --> 00:20:27,659
As vice minister of justice?

241
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:32,872
Yes. I give you my word
as vice minister of justice.

242
00:20:33,081 --> 00:20:37,502
Haven't you noticed that the army
has completely surrounded this jail?

243
00:20:39,462 --> 00:20:42,547
We can end this peacefully...

244
00:20:42,548 --> 00:20:46,052
if you just cooperate
and walk out with me.

245
00:20:46,261 --> 00:20:48,012
Don Pablo,
these bastards will kill you!

246
00:20:53,434 --> 00:20:56,521
I respectfully decline your offer,
Vice Minister.

247
00:20:56,729 --> 00:21:02,819
The press is saying I killed those men,
but that's a lie to sell newspapers.

248
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:09,075
If Gaviria wants me out of here...

249
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:15,581
he can come here...
and do it himself.

250
00:21:18,126 --> 00:21:20,294
Meanwhile...

251
00:21:20,295 --> 00:21:26,218
I'll view any incursion
as a declaration of war.

252
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:43,442
I'll inform the president
of your position.

253
00:21:47,989 --> 00:21:49,448
Excuse me.

254
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:03,171
Mr. Vice Minister.

255
00:22:05,298 --> 00:22:09,344
Why walk all that way
when I have a telephone in my office?

256
00:22:14,391 --> 00:22:17,643
I'd rather call the president
from outside the prison, thanks.

257
00:22:22,481 --> 00:22:25,483
Let me out!

258
00:22:25,484 --> 00:22:29,822
Surely your mother taught you
never to turn down a polite invitation.

259
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:36,537
My mother taught me
an invitation is optional.

260
00:22:36,746 --> 00:22:40,625
I hope you'll forgive me
for making this invitation mandatory.

261
00:22:41,876 --> 00:22:46,463
It's not every day we're honored with the
presence of a vice minister of justice.

262
00:22:51,219 --> 00:22:52,720
Come on, Vice Minister.

263
00:22:52,929 --> 00:22:55,181
Calm down, let's go.

264
00:23:03,231 --> 00:23:06,524
Where have you been?
You don't even answer your phone?

265
00:23:06,525 --> 00:23:08,445
Sorry, I've, uh...
I've been working on it.

266
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:11,197
What the fuck does that mean?
Doing what?

267
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:17,829
I'm sorry.

268
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:21,374
Just trying to hold it together.

269
00:23:25,795 --> 00:23:28,047
God, I just wanna go home.

270
00:23:29,882 --> 00:23:31,759
I want my husband back.

271
00:23:41,269 --> 00:23:44,105
- Do you think he's alive, Javi?
- Yeah.

272
00:23:49,819 --> 00:23:51,029
No.

273
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,699
You're just not sure he's dead.

274
00:24:00,455 --> 00:24:03,416
What's taking this guy so long?

275
00:24:05,293 --> 00:24:07,336
General, with all due respect,

276
00:24:07,337 --> 00:24:10,631
I don't think we should've
let him go inside.

277
00:24:13,134 --> 00:24:14,926
No.

278
00:24:14,927 --> 00:24:19,057
I don't think Pablo is stupid enough
to fuck with the vice minister.

279
00:24:35,698 --> 00:24:37,742
Can I get you something to drink?

280
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:40,411
I don't need anything.

281
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:43,122
Look, don't be so nervous.

282
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:49,379
As soon as you have the president
on the phone, you will make it clear

283
00:24:49,586 --> 00:24:54,716
that if he doesn't remove the troops
surrounding the prison immediately,

284
00:24:54,717 --> 00:24:57,554
there will be grave consequences.

285
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:02,474
But if he withdraws the troops,

286
00:25:02,475 --> 00:25:06,563
we'll stay here quietly
and complete our sentence.

287
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:21,659
Good evening,
President Gaviria's office.

288
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:25,456
It's Eduardo, vice minister of justice.
I need to talk to the president.

289
00:25:25,457 --> 00:25:26,999
One minute, please.

290
00:25:34,257 --> 00:25:36,216
Mr. President,
excuse the interruption.

291
00:25:36,217 --> 00:25:39,011
There is a call from
Vice Minister Sandoval on line three.

292
00:25:40,012 --> 00:25:42,390
- Thank you, María.
- Excuse me.

293
00:25:52,275 --> 00:25:53,276
Hello?

294
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:57,155
Hello?

295
00:26:01,534 --> 00:26:03,035
How long will I be here
as a hostage?

296
00:26:03,244 --> 00:26:07,873
You are not my hostage.
You are my guest.

297
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,427
Escobar has Sandoval
inside the prison.

298
00:26:20,428 --> 00:26:22,720
Hang up right now,
Mr. President.

299
00:26:22,721 --> 00:26:25,349
- Hang up, please.
- I need to know if he's OK.

300
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,682
Mr. President,
hang up the phone.

301
00:26:26,683 --> 00:26:29,895
If Escobar knows you're on the line,
he might force you to strike a bargain.

302
00:26:30,104 --> 00:26:32,607
Or worse, if you lie to him,
he might kill Eduardo.

303
00:26:32,815 --> 00:26:35,276
Hang up the phone. Sir!

304
00:26:43,784 --> 00:26:44,869
Leave us alone.

305
00:26:50,916 --> 00:26:53,335
- They hung up.
- Bullshit.

306
00:26:53,336 --> 00:26:54,879
Shut up!

307
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,219
So, then...

308
00:27:02,761 --> 00:27:06,974
the president is too busy
to speak with me.

309
00:27:08,767 --> 00:27:11,145
I don't understand
how he ended up in that jail.

310
00:27:11,354 --> 00:27:13,234
Me, either.
I don't know what Sandoval is doing.

311
00:27:13,439 --> 00:27:16,483
What did he think, that he could convince
Escobar he was there to help him?

312
00:27:16,484 --> 00:27:19,945
We agreed that Ariza
would have Escobar in custody.

313
00:27:20,154 --> 00:27:22,739
Ariza must've had his reasons
for holding off.

314
00:27:23,991 --> 00:27:26,784
- Right.
- This is a very delicate situation.

315
00:27:26,785 --> 00:27:29,287
You can be sure Escobar's men are armed.

316
00:27:29,288 --> 00:27:34,293
Please, I suggest we call DAS
to bring in a hostage negotiation team.

317
00:27:35,169 --> 00:27:37,088
Do I have your permission?

318
00:27:40,341 --> 00:27:41,509
Good.

319
00:27:46,681 --> 00:27:49,933
María Clara,
connect me with DAS, immediately.

320
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:53,520
- No. No.
- Cancel the call.

321
00:27:55,231 --> 00:27:59,277
- This time, we will not negotiate.
- I don't understand, Mr. President.

322
00:28:00,486 --> 00:28:02,321
If Sandoval dies...

323
00:28:04,198 --> 00:28:06,825
I will have it on my conscience
for the rest of my life.

324
00:28:07,034 --> 00:28:10,871
But my country comes first,
and I will not empower Escobar.

325
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:17,002
Send in the Special Forces...
and finish this, once and for all.

326
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:23,926
I just realized something.

327
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:28,805
The president didn't just betray me...

328
00:28:29,806 --> 00:28:31,517
he also betrayed you.

329
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:36,396
He knew if you came here...
Look at me.

330
00:28:36,397 --> 00:28:38,315
There would be three options.

331
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:42,860
One: I leave with you, peacefully.

332
00:28:42,861 --> 00:28:46,449
Two: I take you hostage.

333
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:50,327
Three: I shoot you,

334
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:55,540
and then, he really would
have a good excuse to kill me.

335
00:28:55,541 --> 00:28:56,709
Right?

336
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:08,304
Either way, he wins.
Right?

337
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:12,015
Maybe the president
is betraying us both.

338
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:14,058
You could be right.

339
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:16,060
But you know something?

340
00:29:16,061 --> 00:29:19,940
I'll sacrifice my life
to make sure you're dead.

341
00:29:27,782 --> 00:29:31,910
You think you're better than me,
but you're wrong.

342
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,458
I come from nothing.

343
00:29:38,459 --> 00:29:42,004
I fought hard
to become what I am.

344
00:29:46,634 --> 00:29:49,428
If the government
hadn't come after me...

345
00:29:50,596 --> 00:29:55,309
I would be where you are now...
the vice minister of justice.

346
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:01,440
You and I are nothing alike.

347
00:30:02,483 --> 00:30:04,527
You are a criminal.

348
00:30:05,486 --> 00:30:07,780
And criminals can't run forever.

349
00:30:10,449 --> 00:30:11,617
Sir.

350
00:30:25,506 --> 00:30:30,635
Your friend Gaviria has ordered
Special Forces to raid the prison

351
00:30:30,636 --> 00:30:33,180
while you're still inside.

352
00:30:35,224 --> 00:30:37,226
I would have done the same thing.

353
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:02,293
Don't kill him.

354
00:31:04,086 --> 00:31:10,426
If he dies... it will be
at the hands of his own government.

355
00:31:17,433 --> 00:31:19,310
Good luck, Vice Minister.

356
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:54,219
Now what?

357
00:31:54,428 --> 00:31:56,346
I'm sorry, Ambassador.
We have a situation.

358
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:57,807
Damn right we do.

359
00:31:59,266 --> 00:32:00,643
Hey, partner.

360
00:32:01,978 --> 00:32:05,271
Remember how I told you
that no one in their right mind

361
00:32:05,272 --> 00:32:07,358
would ever kill a DEA agent?

362
00:32:07,566 --> 00:32:10,360
Well, to be honest,
after they snatched me,

363
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:12,612
I'd forgotten that, myself.

364
00:32:12,613 --> 00:32:17,116
But then, I calmed down and realized
that if they wanted to kill me,

365
00:32:17,117 --> 00:32:20,286
they would've blown my brains out
right in front of my house.

366
00:32:20,287 --> 00:32:23,207
This... was something different.

367
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:28,921
I figured this was Escobar
knowing that they were coming to get him,

368
00:32:29,129 --> 00:32:32,508
and grabbing
a get-out-of-jail-free card: me.

369
00:32:33,968 --> 00:32:35,219
Sit.

370
00:32:36,762 --> 00:32:41,391
Man, you fucked up. You think
that they're gonna make a trade for me?

371
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:42,893
No. No!

372
00:32:42,894 --> 00:32:47,189
They're gonna storm that bullshit fuckin'
prison and blow his fuckin' head off!

373
00:32:56,699 --> 00:32:59,325
I'm sorry
you were taken against your will,

374
00:32:59,326 --> 00:33:03,873
but I knew you wouldn't meet willingly,
given your last meeting with Navegante.

375
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:11,838
Mr. Herrera, I'm glad to see
your Cali cartel is doing so well,

376
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:13,549
but you've made a huge mistake.

377
00:33:14,341 --> 00:33:15,927
I don't see it that way.

378
00:33:17,219 --> 00:33:22,306
I know you like whiskey, but I'm taking
the liberty of making you a cocktail.

379
00:33:22,307 --> 00:33:26,437
I just learned how to do a really
interesting passion fruit daiquiri.

380
00:33:26,645 --> 00:33:29,146
That's wonderful,
but I don't want your fuckin' daiquiri.

381
00:33:29,147 --> 00:33:32,693
You're free to leave anytime.
We are a long way from Bogotá.

382
00:33:32,902 --> 00:33:36,153
Fine. I'm leaving.
I'll show myself out.

383
00:33:36,154 --> 00:33:39,408
I thought you might
like to see some pictures I have.

384
00:33:55,215 --> 00:34:01,262
Several weeks ago, a wire tap caught you
calling Colonel Horacio Carrillo

385
00:34:01,263 --> 00:34:04,976
to ID a location
where Pablo's sicarios were gathering.

386
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,979
Two hours later, they were dead.

387
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:14,735
Along with an innocent woman.

388
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:25,746
OK.

389
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:30,374
Poison will be at La Dispensaria

390
00:34:30,375 --> 00:34:32,294
at around midnight with his crew.

391
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:39,885
Who's your contact at the embassy?

392
00:34:40,094 --> 00:34:42,638
Did you know she had two kids?

393
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:46,599
What do you think our newspapers
will think of that?

394
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:52,815
Our government doesn't take too kindly
to American-backed death squads.

395
00:34:54,025 --> 00:34:56,442
I could blackmail you
with these pictures.

396
00:34:56,443 --> 00:34:59,154
You'd lose your career at the DEA,

397
00:34:59,155 --> 00:35:03,784
go to jail...
maybe here in Colombia.

398
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,536
But don't worry.

399
00:35:06,537 --> 00:35:08,955
I won't ask you or Javier Peña

400
00:35:08,956 --> 00:35:12,084
to cross any line
you haven't already crossed.

401
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:16,921
So you think the DEA and Cali cartel
would be a good match.

402
00:35:16,922 --> 00:35:20,257
There are many,
in every segment of Colombia,

403
00:35:20,258 --> 00:35:23,011
who have been persecuted
by Pablo Escobar.

404
00:35:23,012 --> 00:35:25,138
The families of Moncada and Galeano,

405
00:35:25,139 --> 00:35:28,265
the families of judges and police...

406
00:35:28,266 --> 00:35:31,687
people with resources
who need to be unified.

407
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:33,771
They want vengeance.

408
00:35:33,772 --> 00:35:36,567
- And you'll help them get it?
- With your help.

409
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:43,699
I can't make any commitments right now.

410
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,118
But I can tell you this:

411
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:51,664
When Pablo goes down,
and he will go down...

412
00:35:51,665 --> 00:35:54,667
you'll hear a knock at your door,

413
00:35:54,668 --> 00:35:57,088
and it'll be me.

414
00:36:03,802 --> 00:36:06,388
You haven't tried my daiquiri.

415
00:36:06,597 --> 00:36:09,224
That Herrera's a pretty good host.

416
00:36:09,225 --> 00:36:13,186
Makes a mean cocktail, gives you
door-to-door service right to the embassy.

417
00:36:13,187 --> 00:36:15,730
- What did Herrera say?
- What'd he say?

418
00:36:15,731 --> 00:36:17,149
What'd he say?

419
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:20,317
You fuckin' gave him that information.

420
00:36:20,318 --> 00:36:23,114
He's got pictures on me,
he's got tape on me, Javi.

421
00:36:27,201 --> 00:36:28,619
Answer me.

422
00:36:29,411 --> 00:36:32,455
- What?
- Did you give that shit to Herrera?

423
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:35,750
- Do you think I would do that to you?
- Are you playing with Cali, Javi?

424
00:36:35,751 --> 00:36:38,544
That your version of "all in"?

425
00:36:38,545 --> 00:36:42,591
I got one goal: get Escobar.

426
00:36:44,551 --> 00:36:46,470
That's not an answer.

427
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,057
Who gave him the fucking photos?

428
00:36:52,392 --> 00:36:54,145
Hey.

429
00:37:04,071 --> 00:37:05,989
See you around, Jav.

430
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:08,659
I'm gonna go call my wife.

431
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:44,903
Sir, I have her on the line.

432
00:37:49,366 --> 00:37:51,534
- Hello, my love.
- Hello.

433
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:55,788
Look, we're having
a little problem here.

434
00:37:55,789 --> 00:38:00,627
We're trying to solve it,
but you know what to do...

435
00:38:01,628 --> 00:38:03,754
if it doesn't work out, right?

436
00:38:03,755 --> 00:38:05,299
Yes, Pablo.

437
00:38:06,175 --> 00:38:07,843
I love you very much.

438
00:38:09,636 --> 00:38:10,971
Me, too.

439
00:38:11,972 --> 00:38:14,599
- Very much.
- Goodbye, my love.

440
00:38:40,042 --> 00:38:42,044
We are bandits.

441
00:39:09,071 --> 00:39:12,740
- Wait a minute! What is this?
- Your brigade is no longer in charge!

442
00:39:24,753 --> 00:39:27,880
You've gotta get me out of here,
do you understand?

443
00:39:27,881 --> 00:39:29,800
Come on, come on.

444
00:39:48,777 --> 00:39:52,114
- Hurry up!
- Get down! No! Get in there!

445
00:40:13,885 --> 00:40:15,929
Don't move, don't move!

446
00:40:32,488 --> 00:40:34,030
- All clear!
- All clear!

447
00:40:34,031 --> 00:40:36,074
- All clear!
- All clear!

448
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:00,682
- Don't move! Don't move!
- It's me, it's me, it's me.

449
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:05,229
Keep low, and no matter what happens,
keep moving.

450
00:41:15,697 --> 00:41:17,365
Speak.

451
00:41:17,366 --> 00:41:19,450
Yes, it's him.

452
00:41:19,451 --> 00:41:22,079
Speak up, please,
I can't hear you.

453
00:41:22,287 --> 00:41:23,830
Is that confirmed?

454
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,791
Wait a minute.

455
00:41:28,126 --> 00:41:33,214
Mr. President, they stormed the prison.
Sandoval's been freed.

456
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,595
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

457
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:45,894
And Escobar?

458
00:41:47,396 --> 00:41:48,897
- All clear!
- All clear!

459
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:50,566
- All clear!
- All clear!

460
00:41:53,735 --> 00:41:55,404
Look what we found.

461
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,330
Do you think he's OK?

462
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:09,709
I'm sure he's fine.

463
00:42:33,024 --> 00:42:34,734
See you tomorrow.

464
00:42:35,944 --> 00:42:37,237
Good night.

465
00:42:39,948 --> 00:42:43,160
It's OK... it's OK.

466
00:42:43,368 --> 00:42:45,078
It's OK.

467
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,248
Steve...

468
00:42:49,416 --> 00:42:51,418
I just wanna go home.

469
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:03,096
This is home.

470
00:43:22,449 --> 00:43:26,536
Less than an hour
after Escobar escaped La Catedral,

471
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:30,873
word had spread all over Colombia
that war was coming again.

472
00:43:30,874 --> 00:43:33,376
But this time would be different.

473
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:36,504
This time,
there would be no surrender...

474
00:43:36,505 --> 00:43:39,340
no negotiations...

475
00:43:39,341 --> 00:43:41,009
no deals.

476
00:43:41,968 --> 00:43:45,597
This time...
we were gonna kill him.

477
00:43:49,267 --> 00:43:55,023
Escobar said, "Better a grave
in Colombia than a cell in the US."

478
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,109
Well, guess what, motherfucker?

479
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:01,279
That works for me.
