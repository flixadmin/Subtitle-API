1
00:00:00,162 --> 00:00:01,676
Previously on "Arrow"...

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:03,565
I had no idea you were one of them.

3
00:00:07,032 --> 00:00:08,565
The district attorney's office

4
00:00:08,568 --> 00:00:10,667
will not be pressing
charges on your friends.

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,653
Tomorrow, you will issue
one of these to each of them.

6
00:00:13,656 --> 00:00:15,646
They'll each be deputized like Mr. Queen.

7
00:00:15,649 --> 00:00:17,499
Felicity used to force this stuff on me.

8
00:00:17,501 --> 00:00:19,209
There's another solve.

9
00:00:19,211 --> 00:00:22,304
This could be the key
to finding our mom.

10
00:00:22,306 --> 00:00:24,473
I want our children to know

11
00:00:24,475 --> 00:00:26,679
that they are the most
important thing to us.

12
00:00:26,682 --> 00:00:28,136
You said, "children."

13
00:00:28,139 --> 00:00:29,737
I'm pregnant.

14
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:31,627
Ha ha!

15
00:00:32,586 --> 00:00:34,668
Becoming part of the SCPD is

16
00:00:34,671 --> 00:00:36,725
a great responsibility.

17
00:00:36,728 --> 00:00:38,320
The whole city will be watching you,

18
00:00:38,322 --> 00:00:40,322
holding you to the highest standard.

19
00:00:40,324 --> 00:00:42,082
And now that you're working with us,

20
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:44,251
you need to learn how we do things.

21
00:00:44,253 --> 00:00:46,236
We have rules, protocol.

22
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:48,497
And abiding by them is critical.

23
00:00:48,499 --> 00:00:51,500
The use of excessive force
will not be tolerated.

24
00:00:51,502 --> 00:00:53,743
Your objective is to
defuse the situation,

25
00:00:53,745 --> 00:00:55,262
not escalate it.

26
00:01:01,962 --> 00:01:03,512
Firearms should only be used

27
00:01:03,514 --> 00:01:04,940
as a last resort.

28
00:01:04,943 --> 00:01:07,626
Do not discharge your weapon
unless you are fired upon,

29
00:01:07,629 --> 00:01:10,518
or your life is in danger.

30
00:01:10,521 --> 00:01:13,114
All evidence against a
suspect must be gathered

31
00:01:13,117 --> 00:01:15,440
within the parameters of the law.

32
00:01:15,443 --> 00:01:17,976
Any evidence obtained not in that manner

33
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:20,362
will be deemed inadmissible.

34
00:01:20,364 --> 00:01:24,625
In tactical situations,
avoid suspect-based decisions.

35
00:01:24,627 --> 00:01:26,985
This only leads to chaos and confusion.

36
00:01:26,987 --> 00:01:28,945
And, above all, follow the orders

37
00:01:28,947 --> 00:01:31,447
of the commanding officer on-site.

38
00:01:31,449 --> 00:01:33,521
Wearing the uniform of an SCPD officer

39
00:01:33,524 --> 00:01:34,740
is an honor.

40
00:01:34,743 --> 00:01:36,462
It isn't just a uniform.

41
00:01:36,465 --> 00:01:40,498
It's a symbol of the law, of justice,

42
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,208
of transparency.

43
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:44,794
Thank you, Sergeant Bingsley.

44
00:01:44,796 --> 00:01:47,463
Any questions?

45
00:01:47,465 --> 00:01:48,765
Rene.

46
00:01:48,768 --> 00:01:52,280
He does know we have
our own uniforms, right?

47
00:01:52,283 --> 00:01:53,570
Heh heh.

48
00:01:55,058 --> 00:02:00,086

49
00:02:01,271 --> 00:02:02,696
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

50
00:02:02,698 --> 00:02:04,272
Oh, hey!

51
00:02:04,274 --> 00:02:06,625
How's my favorite new
team of recruits doing?

52
00:02:06,628 --> 00:02:09,150
Missing the good old
days when catching a bad guy

53
00:02:09,153 --> 00:02:10,779
didn't involve homework.

54
00:02:10,782 --> 00:02:13,299
Ah. Well, this is uncharted territory,

55
00:02:13,302 --> 00:02:14,871
so the SCPD just wants to make sure

56
00:02:14,874 --> 00:02:16,561
we're on the same page.

57
00:02:16,564 --> 00:02:18,689
It's a lot, but it'll be worth it.

58
00:02:18,692 --> 00:02:20,474
I mean, we can finally work together

59
00:02:20,477 --> 00:02:21,875
and on the right side of the law.

60
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:23,672
Wait. Does that mean that
the Black Canary's back?

61
00:02:23,674 --> 00:02:27,035
Well, I did get a clean bill
of health from the doctor.

62
00:02:27,038 --> 00:02:28,198
You all are deputized,

63
00:02:28,201 --> 00:02:31,074
so no reason I can't be
captain and Black Canary.

64
00:02:31,077 --> 00:02:33,232
Within the confines
of the law, of course.

65
00:02:33,235 --> 00:02:34,734
Of course.

66
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,044
I want to be clear.

67
00:02:36,047 --> 00:02:37,639
Just because you've been deputized

68
00:02:37,641 --> 00:02:39,746
doesn't mean you have
the latitude to operate

69
00:02:39,749 --> 00:02:40,896
the way you once did.

70
00:02:40,899 --> 00:02:42,997
You work for the SCPD now.

71
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,018
And this arrangement is
on a provisional basis.

72
00:02:46,021 --> 00:02:48,348
Your actions will
determine how long it lasts.

73
00:02:48,351 --> 00:02:49,493
Mm-hmm.

74
00:02:52,155 --> 00:02:54,346
I think she's starting to like us.

75
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,609
Well, that was a different
type of workday for us.

76
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:01,007
Can you believe that pollard
made us go through all that?

77
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,739
Well, I know we're not
used to doing things

78
00:03:03,741 --> 00:03:07,591
by the book, clearly,
but this partnership is

79
00:03:07,594 --> 00:03:08,798
what's best for the city.

80
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:10,102
But she's seen what you can do.

81
00:03:10,105 --> 00:03:11,584
I mean, she knows what we're capable of.

82
00:03:11,586 --> 00:03:13,749
Just trust me. There's no
use arguing with the mayor.

83
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:16,085
- Can...
- You hungry?

84
00:03:16,087 --> 00:03:18,360
Want a tartine, some sauteed broccolini,

85
00:03:18,363 --> 00:03:19,459
something like that?

86
00:03:19,462 --> 00:03:21,965
As much as I appreciate
the "Master Chef" initiative

87
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:23,296
that you got going on here,

88
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:25,112
are you gonna tell me
what's going on with you?

89
00:03:25,114 --> 00:03:28,139
Because you are 100% agreeable and zen

90
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,858
about this whole police 101 thing.

91
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,526
I want this partnership to be done right

92
00:03:31,528 --> 00:03:33,311
and to be legitimate from the beginning

93
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,325
for our baby

94
00:03:35,328 --> 00:03:37,786
because I did not get
that chance with William.

95
00:03:37,789 --> 00:03:38,867
This partnership's not gonna work

96
00:03:38,869 --> 00:03:40,206
if she forgets who she's hired.

97
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:42,037
The partnership has to work, Felicity,

98
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,321
because working with the SCPD

99
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:46,115
and not hiding in the shadows,

100
00:03:46,117 --> 00:03:49,210
I truly believe

101
00:03:49,212 --> 00:03:51,754
that's what's best for the city.

102
00:03:51,756 --> 00:03:53,456
Then we can stay here,

103
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,717
and our children can grow up safely.

104
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:57,353
Well, if you believe

105
00:03:57,356 --> 00:03:59,721
that this is what's best for the city

106
00:03:59,723 --> 00:04:02,496
and what is ultimately
best for our family,

107
00:04:02,499 --> 00:04:04,058
then I agree.

108
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,560
We're a team, too.

109
00:04:05,562 --> 00:04:07,970
Always.

110
00:04:07,972 --> 00:04:10,348
Except maybe we don't, you know,

111
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,203
until the city's safe and our family is

112
00:04:13,206 --> 00:04:14,494
really secure,

113
00:04:14,496 --> 00:04:16,312
that we don't, you know, tell anybody

114
00:04:16,314 --> 00:04:19,332
about what's happening in here.

115
00:04:19,334 --> 00:04:21,025
Because I think it's too early,

116
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,485
and I don't want
anybody crying and asking

117
00:04:22,487 --> 00:04:23,676
about, like, if it's a boy...

118
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,811
- For the... for the city.
- Yeah, for the city.

119
00:04:25,814 --> 00:04:28,675
And for our family.

120
00:04:28,677 --> 00:04:30,701
It's for a better future.

121
00:04:30,703 --> 00:04:31,970
Yay.

122
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:35,916
So about that tartine.

123
00:04:35,926 --> 00:04:40,979
I'm starving. I'm also nauseous.

124
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:56,018
Are they all staring at you or me?

125
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,947
Both. You reek of money,

126
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:01,232
and, well, I'm undefeated.

127
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:03,683
Don't wander off. Don't talk to anyone.

128
00:05:03,686 --> 00:05:05,018
Let me handle this.

129
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:06,689
You don't even know
what we're looking for.

130
00:05:06,691 --> 00:05:09,407
Sure I do. It's a tape mini thingy.

131
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:12,961
A microcassette player
or an answering machine,

132
00:05:12,963 --> 00:05:14,412
old tech from the eighties.

133
00:05:14,415 --> 00:05:15,804
It's the only thing that'll let us

134
00:05:15,807 --> 00:05:17,723
listen to the message
Felicity left for us.

135
00:05:17,726 --> 00:05:19,933
Right. I'm gonna talk to my contact.

136
00:05:19,936 --> 00:05:21,108
Look, I know these people.

137
00:05:21,111 --> 00:05:24,380
They're lowlifes, criminals, like me.

138
00:05:24,382 --> 00:05:28,735
Just stay here and don't do anything.

139
00:05:28,737 --> 00:05:30,070
W...

140
00:05:42,584 --> 00:05:45,961
Bingo.

141
00:05:45,964 --> 00:05:48,204
Something catch your eye?

142
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,052
Uh, yeah. How much
for this piece of junk?

143
00:05:55,764 --> 00:05:58,598
Our best microcassette player.

144
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,292
It's incredibly rare.

145
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,628
I'll give it to you cheap.

146
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,179
$1,000.

147
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:06,450
Cheap?

148
00:06:07,597 --> 00:06:09,258
Look, you and I both know

149
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,082
that no one else is interested in this.

150
00:06:11,085 --> 00:06:13,262
Except you, it seems.

151
00:06:13,264 --> 00:06:14,930
700.

152
00:06:14,932 --> 00:06:16,265
- 400.
- 600.

153
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:19,027
500. Final offer.

154
00:06:19,029 --> 00:06:20,662
We have a deal.

155
00:06:24,868 --> 00:06:27,610
Good doing business with you.

156
00:06:33,076 --> 00:06:36,878
Let go. Let go. Ugh!

157
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,135
You're making a big mistake, man.

158
00:06:39,138 --> 00:06:41,701
You're stupid if you think
you can come at los halcones.

159
00:06:41,704 --> 00:06:43,718
Stop talking!

160
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,628
Him next.

161
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,129
Hey, what the hell...

162
00:07:07,318 --> 00:07:11,696
15 seconds. Impressive.

163
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:13,256
Let's try a leg next.

164
00:07:24,347 --> 00:07:26,799
Last night, 4 Los Halcones Gang members

165
00:07:26,802 --> 00:07:28,979
were found dead in a warehouse.

166
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:32,236
Whoa. That's some "face/off"
level weirdness right there.

167
00:07:32,238 --> 00:07:33,201
Do we know what caused it?

168
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:34,841
The bodies had bullet wounds,

169
00:07:34,844 --> 00:07:36,717
but there were no shells
found at the scene.

170
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,076
Autopsy revealed traces of
an unidentified substance,

171
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:42,488
which caused a chemical
reaction with the blood

172
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,531
that resulted in tox...

173
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:45,211
Their skin melting off.

174
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:48,920
The proper term is toxic
epidermal necrolysis.

175
00:07:48,922 --> 00:07:50,119
- But, basically, yes.
- Yeah.

176
00:07:50,122 --> 00:07:51,497
Ok, how can a bullet just disappear?

177
00:07:51,499 --> 00:07:52,926
There have been rumors of a new weapon

178
00:07:52,928 --> 00:07:54,211
making its rounds on the street.

179
00:07:54,214 --> 00:07:55,730
Toxicology is
working up labs now.

180
00:07:55,732 --> 00:07:57,903
We should have a better idea of
what's going on in the next few hours.

181
00:07:57,905 --> 00:07:59,782
Or I could just put it
into my trusty mass spectrometer

182
00:07:59,784 --> 00:08:01,029
and then compare it to all
the government databases

183
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:03,670
that I've hacked... Um,
accidentally tapped into.

184
00:08:03,673 --> 00:08:04,635
It would just be so much faster.

185
00:08:04,637 --> 00:08:06,243
I'm sure it would,
but, um, I think we're

186
00:08:06,246 --> 00:08:08,559
just gonna wait to get
results when we get them.

187
00:08:08,562 --> 00:08:10,665
In the meantime, let's talk suspects.

188
00:08:10,668 --> 00:08:13,438
The Blackout
Gang. Never heard of them.

189
00:08:13,441 --> 00:08:14,748
Right. They came onto the scene

190
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:16,348
about a month or so
after you went to prison.

191
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,022
They are some bad dudes.

192
00:08:18,025 --> 00:08:19,263
And with the vigilantes gone,

193
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:21,596
they've been causing a lot
of trouble in The Glades.

194
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,956
You know, that place
you guys tend to forget.

195
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:27,233
Los Halcones are their main rival.

196
00:08:27,236 --> 00:08:28,718
So we're looking at a gang war.

197
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:30,220
It seems that way.

198
00:08:30,222 --> 00:08:32,580
All right. I want everybody
working their contacts, okay?

199
00:08:32,582 --> 00:08:35,050
And I want eyes on the
hideouts for both gangs.

200
00:08:35,053 --> 00:08:37,053
You think maybe
we should pay a visit

201
00:08:37,056 --> 00:08:38,252
to the Los Halcones?

202
00:08:38,254 --> 00:08:40,287
I don't think so. You heard pollard.

203
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:42,049
She's looking for any opportunity

204
00:08:42,052 --> 00:08:43,424
to disband this partnership.

205
00:08:43,426 --> 00:08:45,485
Got to run our leads the SCPD way.

206
00:08:51,024 --> 00:08:52,362
Oh, sorry.

207
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,512
That's okay.

208
00:08:55,438 --> 00:08:57,605
I thought I told you to stay put.

209
00:08:57,607 --> 00:09:00,793
If I had, I wouldn't have found this.

210
00:09:00,796 --> 00:09:03,412
I know you think I'm just
some rich idiot, but I...

211
00:09:03,415 --> 00:09:05,237
Had it.

212
00:09:05,239 --> 00:09:07,448
The cassette player. It was right here.

213
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:09,834
Let me guess. Little
girl bumped into you.

214
00:09:09,836 --> 00:09:11,660
Seemed cute, innocent.

215
00:09:11,662 --> 00:09:15,765
Felix... he played you.

216
00:09:15,767 --> 00:09:19,043
You couldn't have just
listened to me, could you?

217
00:09:19,045 --> 00:09:21,211
Wait.

218
00:09:21,213 --> 00:09:22,450
Blackstar.

219
00:09:22,453 --> 00:09:23,954
Screw you, Felix.

220
00:09:23,957 --> 00:09:25,850
You might think twice

221
00:09:25,852 --> 00:09:28,302
before you swing that right hook at me.

222
00:09:32,345 --> 00:09:36,977
One word from me, and
you'll be in SCPD custody.

223
00:09:36,979 --> 00:09:38,288
Ha ha!

224
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,428
No problem, sir, right, Blackstar?

225
00:09:40,431 --> 00:09:41,973
We're just passing through.

226
00:09:45,112 --> 00:09:48,280
District Attorney Laurel Lance.

227
00:09:48,282 --> 00:09:51,020
Yes, I'll accept the charges.

228
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,510
Put the prisoner through.

229
00:09:58,885 --> 00:10:02,053
I don't know what you
thought was gonna happen here,

230
00:10:02,055 --> 00:10:04,077
but you're wasting my time.

231
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,506
There's no way that I'm...

232
00:10:11,513 --> 00:10:14,347
Fine. I'll be right there.

233
00:10:23,611 --> 00:10:25,778
Visitors aren't typically allowed entry

234
00:10:25,781 --> 00:10:27,113
in the cell block.

235
00:10:27,116 --> 00:10:29,339
Slabside doesn't say no to this D.A.

236
00:10:29,341 --> 00:10:33,259
So, tell me, what
exactly am I doing here?

237
00:10:42,545 --> 00:10:46,547
Ricardo Diaz is dead.

238
00:10:46,549 --> 00:10:48,716
Why hasn't this been reported yet?

239
00:10:48,718 --> 00:10:50,277
Well, you, of all people, know

240
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,271
Slabside's under some major scrutiny,

241
00:10:52,274 --> 00:10:54,299
so they're trying to cover it up,

242
00:10:54,302 --> 00:10:57,224
saying he was shivved by another inmate,

243
00:10:57,227 --> 00:10:58,684
but that's a lie.

244
00:10:58,686 --> 00:10:59,983
And you know the truth.

245
00:10:59,986 --> 00:11:03,081
Better. I know who killed him.

246
00:11:07,527 --> 00:11:11,696
Oh. Oh, I get it. You have demands.

247
00:11:11,699 --> 00:11:14,408
Oliver made me a promise
before he left here.

248
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,702
He said he'd get me my freedom.

249
00:11:16,704 --> 00:11:18,374
Where is it?

250
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:19,621
We're working on it.

251
00:11:19,623 --> 00:11:21,221
Work faster.

252
00:11:21,224 --> 00:11:23,709
The terms of your
sentence are rock solid.

253
00:11:23,711 --> 00:11:25,753
There's a lot of red tape,

254
00:11:25,755 --> 00:11:27,518
especially when A.R.G.U.S. is involved.

255
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:29,774
Well, then I guess we're done here.

256
00:11:33,936 --> 00:11:36,830
Ricardo Diaz died the
death that he deserved.

257
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:39,099
I don't care who did it.

258
00:11:39,101 --> 00:11:40,746
Yeah, but you're still here.

259
00:11:40,749 --> 00:11:43,027
I told you I can't get you out of here

260
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,189
any faster.

261
00:11:45,191 --> 00:11:50,161
Then I want to see my son,

262
00:11:50,163 --> 00:11:52,997
and not through a wall of glass.

263
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:55,800
I want him here with me.

264
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,805
Do that, and then we'll talk.

265
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,109
One of my officers just
received word from a contact

266
00:12:13,111 --> 00:12:15,291
the Blackout Gang will be
convening for a weapons buy

267
00:12:15,294 --> 00:12:16,596
tonight in Orchid Bay.

268
00:12:16,599 --> 00:12:18,430
Sounds like our best chance to
get our hands on the new weapon.

269
00:12:18,432 --> 00:12:20,116
Take down the supplier
while we're at it.

270
00:12:20,118 --> 00:12:21,600
Get the unit ready to move out.

271
00:12:21,602 --> 00:12:23,910
- Whoa. SCPD's coming with us?
- Yeah.

272
00:12:23,913 --> 00:12:26,246
Look, that's really
gonna cramp our style.

273
00:12:26,249 --> 00:12:29,959
No. We just need to
learn to suit up together.

274
00:12:29,961 --> 00:12:32,993
About that. Pollard
really wants to make sure

275
00:12:32,996 --> 00:12:35,779
that we're treated the
same as any other Officer.

276
00:12:35,782 --> 00:12:37,250
But we're not like any other officers.

277
00:12:37,252 --> 00:12:38,634
No, that's true.

278
00:12:38,636 --> 00:12:40,872
But for now, we still
have something to prove.

279
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:44,998
And so we will be wearing, um, this...

280
00:12:45,001 --> 00:12:46,989
Out in the field.

281
00:12:46,992 --> 00:12:49,108
Pollard's taking away our threads?

282
00:12:49,111 --> 00:12:52,722
Look, it could be worse. She
wanted to put you in standard blues.

283
00:12:52,725 --> 00:12:55,425
That's also not all.

284
00:12:55,428 --> 00:12:58,538
We can't use our normal weapons.

285
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:01,148
I know. We have to use
SCPD standard issue.

286
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,078
We'll make it work.

287
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,631
We got to make it work.

288
00:13:22,872 --> 00:13:25,014
Alpha Team's in position.

289
00:13:25,016 --> 00:13:27,308
No sign of the seller yet.

290
00:13:31,856 --> 00:13:35,858
Bravo's in position. Overwatch,
do we have eyes, please?

291
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,490
Hold on. Pulling up thermal now.

292
00:13:37,493 --> 00:13:38,844
From satellite?

293
00:13:38,846 --> 00:13:40,439
What did I tell you about
off-the-books hacking?

294
00:13:40,441 --> 00:13:42,031
You said no public resources.

295
00:13:42,033 --> 00:13:43,866
This is private. Loophole.

296
00:13:43,868 --> 00:13:46,560
Yeah, looks like you got incoming.

297
00:13:46,562 --> 00:13:47,816
Looks like a vehicle.

298
00:13:47,819 --> 00:13:49,539
That's our supplier.

299
00:14:11,228 --> 00:14:13,061
Where's Mr. Midas?

300
00:14:13,064 --> 00:14:15,639
He was unable to make it,
but he sends his regards.

301
00:14:15,641 --> 00:14:19,718
Midas, as in the big
cheese ceo at midas medical?

302
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,762
I trust you were happy with your sample.

303
00:14:21,764 --> 00:14:23,406
Very.

304
00:14:23,408 --> 00:14:26,075
We'll take as many of those
bullets as you have to sell.

305
00:14:26,077 --> 00:14:29,154
Start moving in. Do not engage
until the buy is complete.

306
00:14:29,157 --> 00:14:31,513
All 4 of us can't go in
together. We'll be spotted.

307
00:14:31,516 --> 00:14:33,607
We don't split up. That's protocol.

308
00:14:33,609 --> 00:14:34,789
On my signal.

309
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:36,458
Have you seen all the blind spots?

310
00:14:36,461 --> 00:14:38,070
We need to maintain
the element of surprise.

311
00:14:38,072 --> 00:14:40,312
This isn't up for debate.

312
00:14:41,951 --> 00:14:44,635
Now. SCPD! Freeze!

313
00:14:46,598 --> 00:14:48,598
Go! Move!

314
00:14:54,421 --> 00:14:55,980
Let's get out of here.

315
00:14:57,967 --> 00:15:01,802
I'll get the supplier.
You guys take that case.

316
00:15:05,566 --> 00:15:09,267
Hey! Uh!

317
00:15:09,269 --> 00:15:11,770
They're using the poison bullets!

318
00:15:11,772 --> 00:15:15,124
Damn it. Fall back! All units fall back!

319
00:15:27,566 --> 00:15:29,960
Overwatch, the SUV's heading south.

320
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:31,635
Can you track it?

321
00:15:31,638 --> 00:15:35,519
No, I can't, because this
dinosaur of a system just crashed.

322
00:15:43,255 --> 00:15:45,995
Did you not listen to
anything I said in training?

323
00:15:45,998 --> 00:15:48,641
Following protocol is not optional.

324
00:15:48,644 --> 00:15:50,903
Your protocols are flawed.

325
00:15:50,905 --> 00:15:52,827
That's not the problem.

326
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,481
The problem is your refusal
to participate in our system.

327
00:15:55,484 --> 00:15:58,111
We don't need a lecture on how to
handle ourselves on the field.

328
00:15:58,114 --> 00:15:59,572
Clearly, there was a miscommunication.

329
00:15:59,574 --> 00:16:00,753
Is that what you'd call it?

330
00:16:00,756 --> 00:16:01,891
I'd call it a disaster.

331
00:16:01,894 --> 00:16:03,140
Okay. We just need to simmer down.

332
00:16:03,142 --> 00:16:04,700
Because of you, we have no evidence.

333
00:16:04,702 --> 00:16:06,043
Without the evidence,

334
00:16:06,045 --> 00:16:08,189
we'll be lucky to put
them away for a year.

335
00:16:08,192 --> 00:16:09,714
How we do things matters!

336
00:16:09,716 --> 00:16:12,517
Then you're doing things the wrong way.

337
00:16:17,882 --> 00:16:21,258
And you're putting this on us?

338
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,270
Sending two teams into the field

339
00:16:24,272 --> 00:16:25,888
was a mistake.

340
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,441
You should've listened to me

341
00:16:28,443 --> 00:16:30,609
and let us do things our way.

342
00:16:30,611 --> 00:16:32,561
This is our way now, Oliver.

343
00:16:32,563 --> 00:16:36,040
And I'm sorry. But we're all gonna
just have to get used to that.

344
00:16:39,528 --> 00:16:41,504
Excuse me.

345
00:16:43,955 --> 00:16:46,473
Oh. Sorry. Heh.

346
00:16:46,476 --> 00:16:48,551
So I'm sensing some tension here,

347
00:16:48,554 --> 00:16:50,791
but I'm just gonna cut right to it
because csis were able to recover

348
00:16:50,793 --> 00:16:53,057
the bullet that went
into the officer's armor.

349
00:16:53,059 --> 00:16:54,253
Thank god he was wearing that, right?

350
00:16:54,255 --> 00:16:57,502
I mean, nobody wears helmets anymore.

351
00:16:57,505 --> 00:16:59,803
Anyhoo, I ran a tox screen on it

352
00:16:59,806 --> 00:17:01,965
to see why it was making people
go all wicked witch of the west.

353
00:17:01,967 --> 00:17:03,109
I'm melting.

354
00:17:03,111 --> 00:17:04,402
I'm melting. Oh, what a world!

355
00:17:04,404 --> 00:17:06,887
Ahem. Hey. What'd you find?

356
00:17:06,889 --> 00:17:09,431
Chlormethine is a cytotoxic
agent derived from mustard gas.

357
00:17:09,433 --> 00:17:11,259
But that chemical weapon
was banned decades ago.

358
00:17:11,261 --> 00:17:12,560
Except when it's used
for medicinal purposes,

359
00:17:12,562 --> 00:17:13,556
like chemotherapy.

360
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:16,304
Let me guess. All roads
lead back to midas medical.

361
00:17:16,307 --> 00:17:18,397
It is one of 4 labs in
Star City that still uses

362
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,585
chlormethine as an active ingredient.

363
00:17:20,587 --> 00:17:23,245
And the buck stops with
this guy, James Midas.

364
00:17:23,247 --> 00:17:26,115
I met this guy
at an SCPD fundraiser.

365
00:17:26,117 --> 00:17:29,118
He's got deep pockets.
It does benefit the SCPD.

366
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,701
Okay. We got to bring him in.

367
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:32,955
Not until we have proof
that he's behind this.

368
00:17:32,957 --> 00:17:35,841
Dinah, he got
name dropped at the buy.

369
00:17:35,843 --> 00:17:37,510
His company produces the chemical.

370
00:17:37,512 --> 00:17:38,961
How much more proof do you need?

371
00:17:38,963 --> 00:17:41,305
The concrete kind.

372
00:17:41,307 --> 00:17:43,563
After what this department went
through last year with Diaz,

373
00:17:43,565 --> 00:17:45,134
we have all eyes on us.

374
00:17:45,136 --> 00:17:47,094
We just need actionable intel.

375
00:17:47,096 --> 00:17:48,595
Then we can get a warrant,
search his company.

376
00:17:48,597 --> 00:17:50,430
You get a warrant, he's
gonna know we're coming,

377
00:17:50,432 --> 00:17:51,932
and I know that you know that.

378
00:17:51,934 --> 00:17:53,740
I know that if we don't
do things the right way,

379
00:17:53,742 --> 00:17:55,286
then everything we've worked for

380
00:17:55,288 --> 00:17:57,813
since you got out of
prison will be for nothing.

381
00:17:57,815 --> 00:18:00,583
Is that a risk you're willing to take?

382
00:18:11,129 --> 00:18:14,047
Well, that could've gone better.

383
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,714
All the training, the
rules. And now this?

384
00:18:15,716 --> 00:18:17,624
We are not gonna be able
to make Star City safe

385
00:18:17,627 --> 00:18:19,982
if we're constantly being
micromanaged by the SCPD.

386
00:18:19,985 --> 00:18:21,817
Well, that was our first time
out in the field all together.

387
00:18:21,819 --> 00:18:22,824
Maybe it'll get easier.

388
00:18:22,827 --> 00:18:24,173
What if it doesn't
get easier? What, then?

389
00:18:24,175 --> 00:18:25,316
Well, we go after midas our way.

390
00:18:25,318 --> 00:18:26,546
No, you heard Dinah.

391
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:29,802
We do things their way, or this
whole agreement is just gonna blow up.

392
00:18:29,805 --> 00:18:31,530
We just have to prove to the SCPD

393
00:18:31,533 --> 00:18:32,848
that our way is better,

394
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:34,308
and then they will be
adapting to our side

395
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,660
instead of the other way around.

396
00:18:35,662 --> 00:18:37,774
All they want to do
is bring this guy in.

397
00:18:37,777 --> 00:18:40,915
We deliver midas, everybody wins.

398
00:18:42,577 --> 00:18:44,743
Have I told you lately
how smart you are?

399
00:18:44,745 --> 00:18:47,185
Well, I never get tired of hearing it.

400
00:18:48,575 --> 00:18:50,625
I want mint chip.

401
00:18:55,414 --> 00:18:58,349
Do we really expect one of these boxes

402
00:18:58,351 --> 00:19:01,481
to magically connect midas
to those poison bullets?

403
00:19:01,484 --> 00:19:03,437
There's always a paper trail.

404
00:19:05,049 --> 00:19:06,813
How many more boxes are there?

405
00:19:06,816 --> 00:19:09,132
Monroe's about to bring
up another half-dozen

406
00:19:09,135 --> 00:19:10,436
from the file room.

407
00:19:10,438 --> 00:19:12,554
So #Readfaster.

408
00:19:12,556 --> 00:19:15,052
You know, Felicity was right.

409
00:19:15,055 --> 00:19:17,869
We should've digitized
these files years ago.

410
00:19:17,871 --> 00:19:21,188
Maybe Oliver was right, too.

411
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:24,041
Maybe we go after
midas the vigilante way.

412
00:19:25,861 --> 00:19:28,862
There is no more vigilante way, okay?

413
00:19:28,864 --> 00:19:31,031
There is only the SCPD way.

414
00:19:31,033 --> 00:19:32,908
It's my job to enforce it.

415
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:35,887
Look, I get it. You're the captain,

416
00:19:35,889 --> 00:19:37,871
but you're also the Black Canary.

417
00:19:37,873 --> 00:19:39,039
I thought that came first.

418
00:19:39,041 --> 00:19:40,368
- It doesn't.
- Since when?

419
00:19:40,371 --> 00:19:44,043
Since I stuck my neck out to
make this partnership work.

420
00:19:44,046 --> 00:19:48,399
Vigilantes cannot operate
without SCPD sanction.

421
00:19:48,401 --> 00:19:50,561
The sooner all of us understand that,

422
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,305
the better it's gonna be for all of us.

423
00:19:52,308 --> 00:19:54,132
Everyone's got something
at stake here, D.

424
00:19:54,135 --> 00:19:57,692
But if this fails, I'm
the one who loses my job.

425
00:19:57,695 --> 00:19:59,361
It's my ass on the line.

426
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:00,599
I don't understand why this is

427
00:20:00,602 --> 00:20:03,438
so hard for all of you to understand.

428
00:20:05,442 --> 00:20:07,734
Captain Drake.

429
00:20:07,736 --> 00:20:13,282
Yeah. Okay, great. Yeah,
I'll be right there.

430
00:20:13,284 --> 00:20:15,951
That was Monroe. He
found us probable cause.

431
00:20:15,953 --> 00:20:17,887
I'm going to get my warrant.

432
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,521
I just got the first quarter reports.

433
00:20:23,524 --> 00:20:26,295
We're already up 60% from last year.

434
00:20:26,297 --> 00:20:28,459
Yeah, I wanted you to hear it from me.

435
00:20:28,462 --> 00:20:30,003
See you tomorrow.

436
00:20:32,445 --> 00:20:37,597
James Midas, you have failed this city.

437
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:40,309
You have some balls showing up here.

438
00:20:40,311 --> 00:20:41,568
You know who I am?

439
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:43,287
Chlormethine.

440
00:20:43,289 --> 00:20:45,314
You've been weaponizing it.

441
00:20:45,316 --> 00:20:47,199
Now I want to hear you say it.

442
00:20:47,201 --> 00:20:48,574
I press one button,

443
00:20:48,577 --> 00:20:50,544
the whole city comes to my rescue.

444
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:57,384
Yeah. Not with that circa 2017
first build security system.

445
00:20:57,387 --> 00:20:59,346
I don't understand why people
don't just click "update"

446
00:20:59,348 --> 00:21:00,583
when it says "update."

447
00:21:00,586 --> 00:21:01,945
Try again, James.

448
00:21:01,948 --> 00:21:04,624
I'm not telling you
anything. You can't touch me.

449
00:21:04,626 --> 00:21:06,131
Really? Come here.

450
00:21:06,134 --> 00:21:07,908
Stop! You'll regret this.

451
00:21:07,911 --> 00:21:09,171
Not as much as you.

452
00:21:09,173 --> 00:21:12,341
Now tell me what you
know about chlormethine.

453
00:21:12,343 --> 00:21:13,693
Go to hell!

454
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:16,784
Wrong answer.

455
00:21:16,787 --> 00:21:18,498
Wait. Wait!

456
00:21:18,501 --> 00:21:20,041
I'll tell you everything.

457
00:21:20,044 --> 00:21:22,517
I did it, okay? I've been using
chlormethine to make the bullets,

458
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:24,853
and then I've been selling
them to rival gangs.

459
00:21:24,855 --> 00:21:26,122
Good.

460
00:21:26,124 --> 00:21:28,815
Overwatch, you get all that?

461
00:21:28,817 --> 00:21:30,909
Signed, sealed, delivered.

462
00:21:30,911 --> 00:21:33,614
Good. James Midas, by
the authority of the SCPD,

463
00:21:33,617 --> 00:21:36,007
you are under arrest. Come here.

464
00:21:39,941 --> 00:21:42,816
Again, James, you have
my personal promise.

465
00:21:42,819 --> 00:21:45,675
There will be consequences
for this egregious mistake.

466
00:21:45,678 --> 00:21:47,633
I appreciate that, Emily.

467
00:21:47,636 --> 00:21:49,678
I used to have such faith in the police.

468
00:21:49,681 --> 00:21:51,872
I'd hate to think Star City's finest

469
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,517
have become nothing more

470
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:55,911
than a bunch of bullying thugs.

471
00:22:00,592 --> 00:22:02,258
So you're just cutting him loose?

472
00:22:02,261 --> 00:22:04,002
We have no grounds to hold him.

473
00:22:04,005 --> 00:22:05,362
He confessed.

474
00:22:05,364 --> 00:22:06,697
While you were dangling him

475
00:22:06,699 --> 00:22:08,497
over a vat of hydrofluoric acid.

476
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,042
Okay, he was never in any danger.

477
00:22:10,045 --> 00:22:11,659
Yeah, well, that's not his story.

478
00:22:11,662 --> 00:22:13,036
You know, instead of using this case

479
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:14,513
to work within the confines of the law,

480
00:22:14,515 --> 00:22:15,638
you all went rogue.

481
00:22:15,641 --> 00:22:18,654
And you, you let him.

482
00:22:18,657 --> 00:22:22,096
It's time for you to make a choice.

483
00:22:22,098 --> 00:22:24,982
Are you the captain
or are you a vigilante?

484
00:22:29,178 --> 00:22:30,937
I'm the captain.

485
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,366
Then start acting like it.

486
00:22:45,237 --> 00:22:47,046
I asked you to be patient.

487
00:22:47,048 --> 00:22:48,096
It wasn't working.

488
00:22:48,099 --> 00:22:49,956
Well, it would've. I had a warrant.

489
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:51,328
If you had listened to me,

490
00:22:51,331 --> 00:22:53,743
we could be searching
Midas' house right now

491
00:22:53,746 --> 00:22:56,236
instead of being told to
stay 5 miles away from him.

492
00:22:56,239 --> 00:22:58,182
But now we have nothing.

493
00:23:08,811 --> 00:23:10,528
Go on.

494
00:23:18,913 --> 00:23:21,772
Oh! Connor.

495
00:23:21,774 --> 00:23:24,107
Hi, Dad.

496
00:23:24,109 --> 00:23:26,001
Come here, my little hawk.

497
00:23:28,404 --> 00:23:31,614
I missed you so much, little man.

498
00:23:31,624 --> 00:23:33,433
Thank you.

499
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:37,171
Go take a seat on the bed.

500
00:23:37,173 --> 00:23:39,640
Dad owes Ms. Lance a chat.

501
00:23:47,466 --> 00:23:49,257
I don't know what to say.

502
00:23:49,259 --> 00:23:50,966
I'm a woman of my word.

503
00:23:50,969 --> 00:23:54,638
And I'm a man of mine.

504
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,807
The night Diaz died,

505
00:23:56,809 --> 00:24:00,194
I was serving another stint in solitary.

506
00:24:00,196 --> 00:24:02,437
The guard forgot to close the meal slot

507
00:24:02,439 --> 00:24:04,198
after delivering dinner.

508
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,200
So when I heard yelling,

509
00:24:06,202 --> 00:24:08,961
I got up to get a better look.

510
00:24:08,963 --> 00:24:12,447
The killer walked right by my cell,

511
00:24:12,449 --> 00:24:13,966
wearing green leather,

512
00:24:13,968 --> 00:24:16,660
but it wasn't Oliver Queen.

513
00:24:16,662 --> 00:24:18,973
Whoever's been running around dressed up

514
00:24:18,976 --> 00:24:22,666
as the Green Arrow,
that's your murderer.

515
00:24:22,668 --> 00:24:24,894
They killed Diaz.

516
00:24:31,747 --> 00:24:36,157
"I'm the captain"? Really?

517
00:24:36,168 --> 00:24:38,043
I've know you a long time, D,

518
00:24:38,046 --> 00:24:39,398
and I've never seen you roll over

519
00:24:39,401 --> 00:24:40,734
the way you just did with Pollard.

520
00:24:40,736 --> 00:24:42,686
She's the mayor, Rene.

521
00:24:42,688 --> 00:24:44,855
And she can put an end
to this whole operation

522
00:24:44,857 --> 00:24:46,832
anytime she wants.

523
00:24:46,834 --> 00:24:48,408
That's not the point.

524
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:50,220
You've been yelling at me,

525
00:24:50,223 --> 00:24:51,572
been yelling at Oliver,

526
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:52,668
and pretty much acting weird

527
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,352
ever since the weapons buy.

528
00:24:54,355 --> 00:24:58,701
So what's up, D? What's going on?

529
00:24:58,704 --> 00:25:02,014
At the weapons buy,
I tried to use my cry,

530
00:25:02,016 --> 00:25:03,849
but something went wrong.

531
00:25:03,851 --> 00:25:07,019
It didn't work right. It...

532
00:25:07,021 --> 00:25:09,168
It hurt like someone was scraping knives

533
00:25:09,171 --> 00:25:11,065
along the inside of my throat.

534
00:25:14,219 --> 00:25:16,052
I'm sorry.

535
00:25:16,054 --> 00:25:18,680
Being captain is the
only thing I have left.

536
00:25:18,682 --> 00:25:22,660
I can't be the symbol
of being on both sides,

537
00:25:22,662 --> 00:25:25,871
both SCPD and vigilante, because I am...

538
00:25:25,873 --> 00:25:30,901
I'm not the Black Canary.

539
00:25:30,903 --> 00:25:32,878
Not anymore.

540
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,840
That's a bunch of crap, and you know it.

541
00:25:37,242 --> 00:25:39,718
Your cry doesn't make you the Canary.

542
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,892
Did you know that the pin you gave Zoe,

543
00:25:42,895 --> 00:25:45,224
she wears to school every day?

544
00:25:45,226 --> 00:25:46,725
You think she wears that pin

545
00:25:46,727 --> 00:25:48,463
because of your cry? No.

546
00:25:48,466 --> 00:25:50,892
She looks up to you
because you're the person

547
00:25:50,895 --> 00:25:53,231
who will go above and
beyond to do what is right

548
00:25:53,234 --> 00:25:55,425
no matter the personal consequences.

549
00:25:55,427 --> 00:25:58,779
That's who you are no matter what.

550
00:26:01,075 --> 00:26:04,076
Even if that's true, it
doesn't matter anymore.

551
00:26:04,078 --> 00:26:05,819
Of course it does.

552
00:26:05,821 --> 00:26:09,898
You say you can't be the
symbol of being on both sides.

553
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,543
That's exactly what you are.

554
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:19,799
You really fixed this place up.

555
00:26:19,802 --> 00:26:21,284
Yeah, I thought we'd need it

556
00:26:21,286 --> 00:26:22,953
once the whole team got sanctioned.

557
00:26:22,955 --> 00:26:26,790
Oh, it's good to be
back. So good to be back.

558
00:26:26,792 --> 00:26:29,250
How long till we're up and running?

559
00:26:29,252 --> 00:26:30,936
Just a couple minutes.

560
00:26:30,938 --> 00:26:34,130
I can't believe that
confession got dismissed.

561
00:26:34,132 --> 00:26:35,656
Hey.

562
00:26:35,659 --> 00:26:38,760
I had a feeling I'd find you two here.

563
00:26:38,762 --> 00:26:42,861
So I take it you are going after Midas.

564
00:26:42,864 --> 00:26:44,322
He knows we're on to
him, so we need to move fast

565
00:26:44,324 --> 00:26:45,577
before he dumps the evidence.

566
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,128
Right. And what about
working with the cops?

567
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,653
Oh, you've seen what a train wreck

568
00:26:48,656 --> 00:26:49,701
that's been?

569
00:26:49,704 --> 00:26:52,031
We all know that we
operate better on our own.

570
00:26:52,034 --> 00:26:54,771
Now, I would like for you
to be onboard with this,

571
00:26:54,774 --> 00:26:56,617
but if you're not, I would just...

572
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,446
I would ask you to stay out of our way.

573
00:26:58,448 --> 00:27:00,455
Oliver, I will always have your back,

574
00:27:00,458 --> 00:27:02,258
but you're giving up on this partnership

575
00:27:02,261 --> 00:27:03,877
before you're really giving it a chance,

576
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,222
as if you're up against a
clock I don't know about.

577
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:11,492
So what don't I know about?

578
00:27:16,841 --> 00:27:18,799
We're having a baby.

579
00:27:18,802 --> 00:27:20,986
Really?

580
00:27:20,988 --> 00:27:22,280
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

581
00:27:22,283 --> 00:27:24,287
It's a little early. We're
not telling anybody yet.

582
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:27,734
That's amazing! This is wonderful!

583
00:27:27,736 --> 00:27:30,070
It would also explain a hell of a lot.

584
00:27:30,072 --> 00:27:32,665
We don't want a child
born into a city like this.

585
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:36,103
Our mission is not complete.

586
00:27:36,106 --> 00:27:37,411
So we're going to go about this

587
00:27:37,413 --> 00:27:38,542
the only way that we know how,

588
00:27:38,544 --> 00:27:41,247
without politicians
and without a precinct.

589
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:44,418
We're going to do this
the Team Arrow way.

590
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,086
Okay, and that would work

591
00:27:46,088 --> 00:27:47,704
for a while.

592
00:27:47,706 --> 00:27:49,770
And then, uh, then I have to say,

593
00:27:49,773 --> 00:27:51,699
we will be right back to
where we started, Oliver,

594
00:27:51,701 --> 00:27:54,928
without a team, you in
prison, us on the run,

595
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:58,006
and a city no closer to being
saved than where we started.

596
00:27:58,008 --> 00:27:59,817
Our partnership with the force

597
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,509
is not working.

598
00:28:01,511 --> 00:28:03,368
Then we have to find
a way to make it work.

599
00:28:03,371 --> 00:28:05,889
Compromise, do whatever you have to do

600
00:28:05,891 --> 00:28:08,333
because if you want a new
future for this baby of yours,

601
00:28:08,336 --> 00:28:11,061
it won't come by doing the
same thing we used to do.

602
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:13,300
We have to... we have
to be something else...

603
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,592
Something better.

604
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,905
You should've let me take him

605
00:28:22,908 --> 00:28:24,172
and the cops.

606
00:28:24,175 --> 00:28:26,084
I can handle a couple
of poorly-trained goons

607
00:28:26,087 --> 00:28:28,114
who don't know their
right from their left.

608
00:28:29,409 --> 00:28:31,551
What? Why are you
looking at me like that?

609
00:28:31,554 --> 00:28:32,795
Nothing.

610
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:34,084
Spit it out.

611
00:28:34,086 --> 00:28:35,710
I just half-expected you to shout,

612
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:37,730
"Felix, you have failed this city."

613
00:28:37,732 --> 00:28:40,882
Well, that's a dumb thing to say.

614
00:28:40,884 --> 00:28:42,675
That's what our dad used to say.

615
00:28:42,677 --> 00:28:44,903
Oh.

616
00:28:44,905 --> 00:28:47,489
You reminded me of him back there.

617
00:28:50,434 --> 00:28:52,768
So how do you suggest we
get this cassette player

618
00:28:52,771 --> 00:28:55,730
if you're not gonna let me
beat the living hell out of him?

619
00:28:55,732 --> 00:28:57,958
I have an idea.

620
00:29:08,954 --> 00:29:12,264
Got it. Only cost me my next two fights.

621
00:29:12,266 --> 00:29:13,770
Better be worth it.

622
00:29:13,773 --> 00:29:15,601
Oh, this is perfect.

623
00:29:15,603 --> 00:29:18,178
Care to share the plan?

624
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:20,907
What is the one thing the
SCPD wants more than anything

625
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,135
in this city?

626
00:29:22,138 --> 00:29:24,510
- To kill vigilantes.
- Exactly.

627
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:26,593
So let's hope this works.

628
00:29:30,975 --> 00:29:33,476
I got a Canary sighting on the
south side of the Star City bazaar,

629
00:29:33,478 --> 00:29:35,019
headed east.

630
00:29:35,021 --> 00:29:36,863
Let's go!

631
00:29:37,639 --> 00:29:40,032
- Heh heh.
- You're a genius.

632
00:29:40,035 --> 00:29:42,127
I am, like, literally.

633
00:29:46,299 --> 00:29:49,041
I warned you to stay away.

634
00:29:49,044 --> 00:29:50,844
We are not good listeners.

635
00:29:52,601 --> 00:29:54,714
Your friends are off chasing a Canary.

636
00:29:54,717 --> 00:29:57,458
Well, that's what they think anyway.

637
00:29:57,461 --> 00:29:59,354
You'll regret this.

638
00:30:02,007 --> 00:30:04,465
- Dick.
- Nice punch.

639
00:30:04,467 --> 00:30:06,026
Yeah.

640
00:30:09,181 --> 00:30:10,447
Thank you.

641
00:30:14,327 --> 00:30:17,570
Wow. The place looks great.

642
00:30:17,573 --> 00:30:19,647
Wow.

643
00:30:19,649 --> 00:30:21,575
Why did you guys call us here?

644
00:30:21,577 --> 00:30:23,641
To apologize.

645
00:30:23,644 --> 00:30:25,671
We shouldn't have gone off-book

646
00:30:25,674 --> 00:30:27,005
to go after midas.

647
00:30:27,008 --> 00:30:28,674
I appreciate that.

648
00:30:28,676 --> 00:30:31,581
And while we're clearing the air here,

649
00:30:31,584 --> 00:30:33,995
I'm... I'm sorry, too.

650
00:30:33,997 --> 00:30:37,766
Okay? I was hard on you. I was too hard.

651
00:30:40,195 --> 00:30:41,745
You guys want to hug or something?

652
00:30:41,748 --> 00:30:43,163
Why don't we save the hugging

653
00:30:43,166 --> 00:30:44,857
until after we catch midas?

654
00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:46,608
The second reason that
we called you here.

655
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:49,385
We found a lead. Or
Felicity found a lead.

656
00:30:49,387 --> 00:30:51,029
In trying to find where midas is storing

657
00:30:51,031 --> 00:30:53,031
his skin-melting poison,
I was able to alter

658
00:30:53,034 --> 00:30:55,732
my security system
algorithm to track DNA

659
00:30:55,735 --> 00:30:57,369
anywhere in Star City.

660
00:30:57,372 --> 00:30:59,129
You have Midas' DNA?

661
00:30:59,132 --> 00:31:01,291
Well, it turns out he's not
as squeaky clean as we thought.

662
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:03,412
I got his DNA from the SCPD archive.

663
00:31:03,415 --> 00:31:05,084
He was arrested 15 years ago.

664
00:31:05,087 --> 00:31:06,786
Thank goodness the police
have record hoarders.

665
00:31:06,788 --> 00:31:09,255
And since he has a record
and we work for the SCPD,

666
00:31:09,258 --> 00:31:10,545
voila!

667
00:31:10,548 --> 00:31:12,917
I interfaced with the
SCPD's surveillance system

668
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,827
and was able to legally
monitor everywhere

669
00:31:14,829 --> 00:31:16,630
midas has been in the last two weeks.

670
00:31:16,632 --> 00:31:18,635
Country club, office, home, and...

671
00:31:18,638 --> 00:31:19,877
And a warehouse registered

672
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,800
to what is clearly a shell corporation?

673
00:31:21,803 --> 00:31:24,283
Obviously, he's keeping
the chemicals there.

674
00:31:24,286 --> 00:31:25,943
And look whose
DNA is there right now.

675
00:31:25,945 --> 00:31:28,354
Midas is probably trying to
destroy the evidence as we speak.

676
00:31:28,357 --> 00:31:30,398
He can try, but he's not
gonna get away with it.

677
00:31:30,401 --> 00:31:31,778
We're gonna get him.

678
00:31:34,575 --> 00:31:37,409
We want to do things
the right way this time.

679
00:31:37,411 --> 00:31:40,061
That means doing a
few things differently.

680
00:31:40,063 --> 00:31:41,229
What did you have in mind?

681
00:31:41,231 --> 00:31:43,773
First things first...

682
00:31:43,775 --> 00:31:45,000
Suit up.

683
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:58,122
I want all of this gone,

684
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:00,292
not a single drop left behind.

685
00:32:00,294 --> 00:32:02,177
Overwatch to Team Arrow.

686
00:32:02,179 --> 00:32:03,849
I have confirmation on Midas

687
00:32:03,852 --> 00:32:05,814
and a crapload of gun-toting goons.

688
00:32:07,028 --> 00:32:08,171
What about the chemicals?

689
00:32:08,174 --> 00:32:10,192
Being loaded
into the back of a truck.

690
00:32:10,195 --> 00:32:12,136
Dinah, what's your status?

691
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:13,475
Almost in position.

692
00:32:13,478 --> 00:32:15,307
Take it to the reservoir.

693
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:18,285
Anyone tries to stop you...
I don't care who it is...

694
00:32:18,287 --> 00:32:19,745
Kill them.

695
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:24,051
Guys, you may want to speed things
up. They're about to move out.

696
00:32:24,054 --> 00:32:25,357
If those chemicals reach the reservoir,

697
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:26,800
everyone in Star City will be at risk.

698
00:32:26,802 --> 00:32:28,611
We can't let that truck leave.

699
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,864
No, we won't.

700
00:32:30,866 --> 00:32:33,342
Hyah! Hyah...

701
00:32:37,265 --> 00:32:39,640
You have the right to remain silent.

702
00:32:39,642 --> 00:32:40,849
Now!

703
00:32:55,868 --> 00:32:57,752
Get me out of here,

704
00:32:57,755 --> 00:32:59,438
and I'll double your salaries.

705
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:08,331
Bad news, guys.

706
00:33:08,334 --> 00:33:11,744
Midas is about two minutes
away from being a free man.

707
00:33:11,747 --> 00:33:13,813
Got go stop him.

708
00:33:13,816 --> 00:33:15,750
You go. I'll secure the evidence.

709
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:40,558
We're taking heavy fire! We're cornered!

710
00:33:52,548 --> 00:33:54,790
Man, I really missed our toys.

711
00:33:56,126 --> 00:33:58,552
The chemicals are secure. Where's Midas?

712
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,898
James Midas,

713
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,080
you are under arrest.

714
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:14,902
Not tonight.

715
00:34:14,904 --> 00:34:17,738
You think this is gonna work
out better than last time?

716
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:22,809
Because now I'll have your
badge and your costume.

717
00:34:24,222 --> 00:34:25,821
Uh!

718
00:34:25,823 --> 00:34:27,772
I don't think so.

719
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:30,659
Thanks to all those
chemicals we just confiscated,

720
00:34:30,661 --> 00:34:33,829
you're going away for a long time.

721
00:34:33,831 --> 00:34:36,090
Like I said...

722
00:34:37,593 --> 00:34:40,094
You're under arrest.

723
00:34:49,983 --> 00:34:52,866
James Midas is in SCPD lockup.

724
00:34:52,868 --> 00:34:54,417
We got what we need to put him away

725
00:34:54,419 --> 00:34:56,035
for a very long time.

726
00:34:56,037 --> 00:34:58,037
Thank you for doing it the legal way.

727
00:34:58,039 --> 00:34:59,831
Thank you for letting us do it our way.

728
00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:01,332
And for joining us.

729
00:35:01,334 --> 00:35:02,592
We missed you, Canary.

730
00:35:02,594 --> 00:35:04,377
I missed her, too.

731
00:35:04,379 --> 00:35:06,170
Thank you for reminding me of that.

732
00:35:06,172 --> 00:35:07,504
Wait. Why do I get the feeling

733
00:35:07,506 --> 00:35:09,747
the Canary flight was a
one-night-only kind of thing?

734
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:14,766
I'll be back in the field,
just, uh, without my cry.

735
00:35:16,659 --> 00:35:19,658
When my nerve was ruptured,
it created lasting damage.

736
00:35:19,661 --> 00:35:22,656
I'm... I'm sorry, Dinah.

737
00:35:22,659 --> 00:35:25,944
Well, Dinah, cry or no cry,
you are the Black Canary.

738
00:35:25,947 --> 00:35:28,007
You proved that tonight.

739
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:30,287
Thank you.

740
00:35:30,289 --> 00:35:31,901
You know what else we did tonight?

741
00:35:31,904 --> 00:35:34,073
We forced Pollard's hand.

742
00:35:34,075 --> 00:35:36,367
I leveraged her relationship with Midas

743
00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:38,295
to convince her to sign off on creating

744
00:35:38,297 --> 00:35:40,395
a special vigilante task force.

745
00:35:40,398 --> 00:35:42,823
We're still sanctioned by the SCPD,

746
00:35:42,826 --> 00:35:44,659
but we're operating as our own unit

747
00:35:44,662 --> 00:35:47,545
out of the bunker in our suits.

748
00:35:47,547 --> 00:35:49,332
And the anti-vigilante law?

749
00:35:49,335 --> 00:35:52,272
It's on her desk for
repeal. She's gonna sign it.

750
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:55,090
So we're like the
Black Ops for the SCPD now?

751
00:35:55,093 --> 00:35:56,188
That's cool.

752
00:35:56,191 --> 00:35:57,700
I'm just glad we're all back.

753
00:35:57,703 --> 00:35:58,868
It feels right.

754
00:35:58,871 --> 00:35:59,891
I'll second that.

755
00:35:59,893 --> 00:36:01,684
It's nice to be part of a team again.

756
00:36:01,686 --> 00:36:03,653
And be here at the bunker...

757
00:36:03,655 --> 00:36:05,414
The sweet bunker.

758
00:36:05,416 --> 00:36:08,265
Do you guys feel like hitting
up the, uh, "sweet" bar?

759
00:36:08,268 --> 00:36:09,435
You guys go ahead.

760
00:36:09,438 --> 00:36:10,994
I ate something that's not
gonna mix well with alcohol.

761
00:36:10,996 --> 00:36:13,589
Yeah. I'm gonna hang back, too, guys.

762
00:36:13,591 --> 00:36:14,982
Okay.

763
00:36:20,121 --> 00:36:23,340
I got you something.

764
00:36:23,342 --> 00:36:25,416
Gee, you shouldn't have.

765
00:36:25,418 --> 00:36:27,585
Well, it was the only
thing that Lyla said

766
00:36:27,587 --> 00:36:29,087
helped her with her nausea.

767
00:36:29,089 --> 00:36:30,630
They're ginger candy chews.

768
00:36:30,632 --> 00:36:32,791
Oh, god. I'll try anything.

769
00:36:32,794 --> 00:36:34,999
Morning sickness or not, Felicity,

770
00:36:35,002 --> 00:36:37,020
you have not missed a beat.

771
00:36:37,022 --> 00:36:39,426
You were absolutely
amazing out there today.

772
00:36:39,429 --> 00:36:40,782
Your tech was phenomenal.

773
00:36:40,784 --> 00:36:43,339
Well, Curtis would've had
5 ideas to make it better, but...

774
00:36:43,342 --> 00:36:44,453
Well, maybe...

775
00:36:44,455 --> 00:36:45,937
But if Curtis was still at A.R.G.U.S.,

776
00:36:45,939 --> 00:36:47,271
I would've asked him to buy your tech.

777
00:36:47,273 --> 00:36:48,629
And I'm sure A.R.G.U.S. wouldn't be

778
00:36:48,631 --> 00:36:51,700
the only corporation hunting for it.

779
00:36:51,703 --> 00:36:54,070
And I think that's more
than a security system

780
00:36:54,072 --> 00:36:55,822
you're working on.

781
00:36:55,824 --> 00:36:58,425
I think you're on to something big.

782
00:37:12,006 --> 00:37:13,981
Thank you for coming in.

783
00:37:13,984 --> 00:37:16,818
I'm Laurel Lance, District Attorney.

784
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,845
I know who you are.

785
00:37:18,847 --> 00:37:21,398
And I know who you are, too.

786
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,159
Emiko Adachi.

787
00:37:24,161 --> 00:37:26,107
Your mother was killed a year ago.

788
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:28,059
Your father is Robert Queen.

789
00:37:28,062 --> 00:37:30,521
And for the last 7 months,

790
00:37:30,524 --> 00:37:33,000
you've been running around the city

791
00:37:33,003 --> 00:37:34,605
dressed like your brother.

792
00:37:34,608 --> 00:37:36,887
And you've also managed
to endear yourself

793
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:38,531
to Oliver and his team.

794
00:37:38,533 --> 00:37:40,491
I also know that you were at Slabside

795
00:37:40,493 --> 00:37:42,535
the night that Ricardo
Diaz burned to death.

796
00:37:42,537 --> 00:37:44,587
What's your point?

797
00:37:44,589 --> 00:37:47,257
That you're lying about
who you really are.

798
00:37:47,259 --> 00:37:49,184
You're not a hero.

799
00:37:49,186 --> 00:37:51,711
And I wonder how Oliver
and his team will feel

800
00:37:51,713 --> 00:37:53,880
when they find out that
their new vigilante friend

801
00:37:53,882 --> 00:37:57,267
murdered Diaz in cold blood.

802
00:37:57,269 --> 00:37:59,552
I'm guessing family dinners are gonna be

803
00:37:59,554 --> 00:38:01,029
a little bit more awkward.

804
00:38:01,031 --> 00:38:04,441
And, uh, what makes you think

805
00:38:04,443 --> 00:38:08,394
they will believe a word you say,

806
00:38:08,396 --> 00:38:10,831
Black Siren?

807
00:38:18,881 --> 00:38:22,032
Do you think I'm showing,
just even a little?

808
00:38:22,042 --> 00:38:24,977
I think you look exactly the same.

809
00:38:27,095 --> 00:38:28,803
How you feeling?

810
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,499
Oh, I feel like I
could sleep for 2 weeks.

811
00:38:30,502 --> 00:38:32,802
Oh, yeah.

812
00:38:32,804 --> 00:38:36,714
Hey, so in between
updating the SCPD's tech

813
00:38:36,716 --> 00:38:38,716
and taking down evil CEOs,

814
00:38:38,718 --> 00:38:41,719
I was brainstorming baby names today.

815
00:38:41,721 --> 00:38:42,887
- Really?
- Yeah.

816
00:38:42,889 --> 00:38:44,406
Any frontrunners?

817
00:38:44,408 --> 00:38:47,484
For a boy, I've always liked Lucas.

818
00:38:47,486 --> 00:38:50,269
Yeah. Lucas.

819
00:38:50,271 --> 00:38:52,489
That's good.

820
00:38:52,491 --> 00:38:56,552
I may have thought of a name for a girl.

821
00:38:56,555 --> 00:38:57,821
Yeah?

822
00:39:00,923 --> 00:39:02,423
Mia.

823
00:39:02,426 --> 00:39:04,384
Short for Moira.

824
00:39:05,862 --> 00:39:08,571
Sweet and fiery.

825
00:39:10,125 --> 00:39:11,624
I love it.

826
00:39:11,626 --> 00:39:14,010
And regardless of whether we have

827
00:39:14,012 --> 00:39:16,199
a boy or a girl...

828
00:39:17,463 --> 00:39:19,132
I just want to make sure that...

829
00:39:19,134 --> 00:39:22,969
She or he end up...

830
00:39:22,971 --> 00:39:25,612
Growing up in a better
and safer Star City

831
00:39:25,615 --> 00:39:26,806
than I did.

832
00:39:26,808 --> 00:39:28,283
Yeah.

833
00:39:28,285 --> 00:39:30,685
I want that for both of our children.

834
00:39:33,982 --> 00:39:36,315
They'll always have
each other to lean on.

835
00:39:36,317 --> 00:39:38,293
And we'll always have us.

836
00:39:42,752 --> 00:39:44,585
What are you waiting for?

837
00:39:44,588 --> 00:39:46,486
Let's play the damn thing.

838
00:39:46,489 --> 00:39:48,230
I don't know. What are you waiting for?

839
00:39:48,233 --> 00:39:49,930
Fine.

840
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:55,263
Maybe I should do it.

841
00:39:55,266 --> 00:39:56,497
It's not as easy as it look...

842
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,100
Just give it to me.

843
00:40:03,089 --> 00:40:05,607
This is some, like,
feelings thing, isn't it?

844
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:08,014
Well, I haven't heard Felicity's voice

845
00:40:08,016 --> 00:40:11,851
in almost two decades, so, yeah, it is.

846
00:40:11,853 --> 00:40:14,745
Look, whatever she says on there,

847
00:40:14,748 --> 00:40:17,740
it's clear she wanted
both of us to hear it...

848
00:40:17,742 --> 00:40:19,751
Together.

849
00:40:22,387 --> 00:40:25,113
All right. Let's just
get this over with.

850
00:40:28,053 --> 00:40:29,913
William and Mia,

851
00:40:29,916 --> 00:40:31,388
you know, this is the first time

852
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:33,306
I've ever said your names together?

853
00:40:33,309 --> 00:40:36,258
20 years, and I avoid ever saying
your names in the same sentence.

854
00:40:36,261 --> 00:40:39,393
It feels like the work of a
paranoid, overprotective mother.

855
00:40:39,396 --> 00:40:41,271
I guess we really do
turn into our parents.

856
00:40:41,274 --> 00:40:42,765
I'm rambling. Sorry.

857
00:40:42,767 --> 00:40:44,246
Not just for the rambling.

858
00:40:44,249 --> 00:40:48,011
For everything, but mostly for
keeping the two of you apart.

859
00:40:48,014 --> 00:40:50,607
I'm not asking for your forgiveness,

860
00:40:50,609 --> 00:40:53,851
but just know that your father
and I did it to protect you.

861
00:40:53,853 --> 00:40:55,809
We did it because we love you.

862
00:40:55,812 --> 00:40:57,553
Now that you've found each other,

863
00:40:57,556 --> 00:40:59,615
I just have one request.

864
00:40:59,618 --> 00:41:02,043
Give these coordinates to the team:

865
00:41:02,045 --> 00:41:07,594
47.6119 North, 122.3301 West.

866
00:41:07,597 --> 00:41:09,781
And then get the hell out of Star City.

867
00:41:09,784 --> 00:41:12,951
And whatever you do,
don't come looking for me.

868
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:18,892
So we're ignoring her.

869
00:41:18,895 --> 00:41:20,519
Definitely.

870
00:41:23,383 --> 00:41:25,567
I know where these lead.

871
00:41:29,097 --> 00:41:31,656
That's where.

872
00:41:36,684 --> 00:41:39,397
We're going over the wall...

873
00:41:39,399 --> 00:41:41,082
to The Glades.

874
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:46,857
