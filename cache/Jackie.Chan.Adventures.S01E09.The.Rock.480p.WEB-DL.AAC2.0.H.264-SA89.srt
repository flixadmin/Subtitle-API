on colds?

337
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:20,925
The talisman.

338
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:24,529
How'd tohru
activate it? How?

339
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:28,099
Ah-choo!

340
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,775
Hey.

341
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:39,610
Hey!

342
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,713
Hyah!

343
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:45,249
Aroo-uhh-uhh,
uhh-ugh-uhh.

344
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:49,086
Uhh-uhh-urr-uhh-uhh-uhh.

345
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:50,254
[Crash]

346
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:51,355
Tohru: Ow!

347
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,423
Jackie!

348
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:53,858
Ohh.

349
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,526
I told you
I would bring
the antidote.

350
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,563
You must never
question uncle!

351
00:19:58,565 --> 00:20:00,765
Thank you both.

352
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:04,368
Now, we have some
talismans to return.

353
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,837
I've got some
explaining to do, huh?

354
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,506
We will just tell
captain black

355
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:11,342
we were between a rock
and a hard place.

356
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:13,744
Heh heh.

357
00:20:19,251 --> 00:20:20,384
Boy: Hey, Jackie,

358
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,553
do you have
a favorite color?

359
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,755
My favorite color:

360
00:20:24,757 --> 00:20:27,425
White, blue--light blue.

361
00:20:27,427 --> 00:20:29,160
Green is good.

362
00:20:29,162 --> 00:20:30,328
As normal as possible.

363
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:32,763
When I look at the sky--
all blue, all white:

364
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:33,931
So beautiful.

365
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:36,567
Sometimes for the movie
I'm wearing a red,

366
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:39,337
pink, uh, purple--

367
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:41,839
I don't like that.
Mostly I like white.

368
00:20:41,841 --> 00:20:48,045
White means calm,
gentleman, nice person
and handsome.
