174

The reason that I've kept Malcolm close
for the past several months...

175
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,364
...is because he had critical intel
on our enemy.

176
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,783
He knows Ra's. He knows the League.

177
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,620
And he knew that if I was appointed
his successor...

178
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,247
...that meant Starling City
was marked for death.

179
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:50,543
The only way that we were gonna defeat
the League was from the inside.

180
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:55,256
I had to get close enough to Ra's to find out
how he was gonna destroy the city...

181
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:56,966
...and stop him.

182
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,136
You trusted Malcolm Merlyn
more than the two people closest to you.

-...once you got back?
-I didn't.

187
00:12:13,024 --> 00:12:15,734
I flew with Ra's and the virus to Starling...

188
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,320
...and I sabotaged the plane.

189

The plan...

190
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:23,451

It didn't work.

192

You didn't.

So that was your big plan?

197

It was the only way.

199

Execute.

640
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:24,672
Why can't anything
ever work on the first try?

641
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,132
Hm?

642
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:58,122
At least admit this was your goal all along.

643
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:01,960
My only aspiration was to free myself
of your father's grasp.

644
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,796
A feat we both managed to achieve.

645
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:08,508
I don't see how it was possible
in your case.

646
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:11,260
When I was your father's captive
three months ago...

647
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,137
...he tortured me with his blade.

648
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:16,391
And you survived because my father
chose to release you.

649
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,059
Funny thing, prophecies.

650
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:20,395
Fate and my father have shown you mercy.

651
00:41:21,062 --> 00:41:22,647
I will not.

652
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:25,358
You took Sara from me,
and I will have justice.

653
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:27,318
You are welcome to try.

654
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,655
Until then...

655
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:33,700
...kneel before Ra's al Ghul.

656
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,926
OLIVER:
<i>My name is Oliver Queen.</i>

657
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:54,012
<i>After five years in hell...</i>

658
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,556
<i>...I returned home with only one goal.</i>

659
00:41:56,848 --> 00:41:59,017
<i>To save my city.</i>

660
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,685
<i>And I did.</i>

661
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:03,187
<i>I became a hero who helped people.</i>

662
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,857
<i>But now it's time for me
to be someone else.</i>

663
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:09,944
<i>It's time for me to be something else.</i>

664
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:17,535
So where are we going?

665
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:21,456
I'm thinking a state that can annul
a Nanda Parbat marriage.

666
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,041
[OLIVER CHUCKLES]

667
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:24,625
Can I say something strange?

668
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,921
I'm happy.
