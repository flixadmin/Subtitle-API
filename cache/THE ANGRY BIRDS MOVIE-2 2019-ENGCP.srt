1
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,040
- Those are good worms right there.
- Hey, Alex!

2
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,880
How's the commute treating you?
Hey, I can't complain.

3
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,960
- That never stopped him before.
- Right?

4
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,640
Well, we made good time today.

5
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,200
Red was one of my students.

6
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,840
- Not sure about the dabbing, though.
- Mom! Mom, did you get my picture?

7
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,600
Well, this is our stop.

8
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,400
<i>The birds in the sky
Go through the air</i>

9
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,960
<i>All the way there</i>

10
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,360
Today, we're gonna learn about
how Red saved the eggs.

11
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,440
- I love Red!
- I gotta go to the bathroom!

12
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,200
Why didn't you go in the slingshot?

13
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,880
Bomb, anything from Piggy Island?

14
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,040
- Nope.
- Chuck. Anything to the north?

15
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,200
- Nope. Nothing.
- What's that?

16
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,280
Incoming pie!

17
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,000
- It's coming straight for us.
- What do we do?

18
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,200
- Duck!
- What?

19
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,560
- Hey, sorry, buddy.
- I got pie all over my face!

20
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,040
- What?
- Yeah!

21
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,200
- Those pigs...
- Are gonna pay...

22
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,200
For our lunches!

23
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,920
Because of our hunger to give them...

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,520
- A taste of their own...
- Quesadillas!

25
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,160
What?

26
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,200
- It's Red.
- I'm sorry, guys.

27
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,560
We're taking over the Blue Line.
Official business.

28
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,520
- Oh, yeah!
- Of course, anything for you, Red.

29
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,840
Hey, Red!

30
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,320
Isn't it funny how nobody liked you
until you saved Bird Island?

31
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,400
But now we all love you.

32
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:51,000
Thanks so much
for bringing that up. Okay, ready?

33
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,480
- Three...
- Two...

34
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,720
Two!

35
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,680
- Bomb, you say "one."
- Oh, right. One!

36
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,800
Yoo-hoo. Hot sauce, please.

37
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,840
Yeah! Got him.

38
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,760
- Thank you.
- Red...

39
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,680
I really want the red one.
The red one.

40
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,560
Balloonie!

41
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,720
That's it. A little bit higher.

42
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,240
But I was bouncing!

43
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,600
You mess with the hatchlings,
you get the cannonball.

44
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,040
- Ready, big guy?
- Oh, yeah. You ready, bigger guy?

45
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,840
Cannonball...

46
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,800
- Why won't you just take a bath?
- Why won't you just take a bath?

47
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,240
This might pinch a little.

48
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,720
- I can't see!
- Catch you later. You stupid birds.

49
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,960
No! Please, don't!

50
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,720
Not on my watch.

51
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,160
Sorry, guys.

52
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,800
Excuse me, sir,
but I believe this belongs to you.

53
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,920
- My hero.
- Don't. Stop. I said, "Don't stop."

54
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,000
- Leonard?
- Got him!

55
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,360
Hey, Leonard, you should probably...

56
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,120
That's not coming from Bird Island.

57
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,960
What the heck is that?
And where did it come from?

58
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,760
We're gonna need a bigger slingshot.

59
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,800
Another successful day
of protecting the island.

60
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,120
- Great job, guys.
- Oh, yeah.

61
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,080
- You saved us, Red.
- You saved us, Red.

62
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,240
You're our hero.

63
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,160
Heh, what can I say?
That's what I do.

64
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,240
Now, why don't you just go run along
and keep your big, cute eyes

65
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,240
peeled for the next pig prank,
all right?

66
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,520
Pigs.

67
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,680
- We're going to get you!
- Oink...

68
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,560
Adorable. Okay, let's just finish
cleaning up these crabs

69
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,600
- then we can move on to...
- Done and done.

70
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,560
- Red, what is it?
- What the heck? Is it a per...

71
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,560
Is it a head? What is that?

72
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,520
Oh, look. It seems like
it's some kind of note.

73
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,336
What if it's a love note?
What if it's a message in a bottle?

74
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,960
Or a genie in a bottle.

75
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,960
Guys, there's no bottle,
so just, you know, stop.

76
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:06,160
<i>Dear Birds, we humbly
request a truce.</i>

77
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,160
<i>Can we talk? Love, Leonard, XOXO.</i>

78
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,720
Nice try, piggies.
News flash: We're not idiots.

79
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,960
- Hey.
<i>- Dear Birds...</i>

80
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,280
<i>you are idiots,
but we are serious about the truce.</i>

81
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,520
I got it! Oh, no!

82
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,080
- Check it out, everybody.
- Let me see that.

83
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,160
A truce!

84
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,120
- A truce with the pigs!
- A truce?

85
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,040
- The prank war is over!
- What?

86
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,360
No, this is just another one
of their pranks.

87
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,520
- What?
- This is a huge relief, right?

88
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,320
I mean, who else was getting tired
of the pranking and retaliation?

89
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,720
- Me! This guy!
- Tired? No... Guys, listen.

90
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,920
Imagine all the fun things
we can do now.

91
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,720
- I can think of one.
- You think he'll go?

92
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,160
- I think we've piqued his interest.
- No...

93
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,000
Guys, we are working tirelessly,
day and night, to save the world.

94
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,880
- But the world doesn't need saving.
- Of course they need us.

95
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,160
Red.

96
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,560
Come here, hon.
What are you so afraid of?

97
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:15,080
Afraid of? I...
What do I have to be afraid of?

98
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,920
- I'm not afraid of anything.
- You know what?

99
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,680
I'm gonna write you a prescription
for fun with your cool friends.

100
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,960
- Especially Chuck.
- Come on. Come with us.

101
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,696
What are you talking...
Come with you to what?

102
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,120
Buddy, we can't tell you
because you wouldn't be into it.

103
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,280
- Oink...
- Oink...

104
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,720
Now we have all your eggs.

105
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,560
Yeah. And there's nothing
you can do about it, Red.

106
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,240
- Oink...
- Oink...

107
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,920
Laugh it up, piggies

108
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,240
because you're gonna be crying
in a second when I kick your butts

109
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,240
- and take those rocks back.
- Eggs.

110
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,040
- What?
- You said "rocks"

111
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,440
instead of "eggs" again.

112
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,520
Oh, sorry.
I don't know why I keep doing that.

113
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,240
Because they are rocks.

114
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,000
Don't cry, Sam-Sam.
I'll be right back.

115
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,840
Hey, Daddy.

116
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,600
Just borrowing my sisters
for a minute.

117
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,560
Now we really have all your eggs.

118
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,640
Yeah, and there's nothing
you can do about it, Red.

119
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,960
- Oink...
- Oink...

120
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,720
Laugh it up, piggies, because you're
gonna be crying in a second

121
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,800
when I kick your butts
and take all your...

122
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,920
Oh, crap.

123
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,160
Okay, we'll just...

124
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,440
What is this thing
that almost killed me?

125
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,240
Frozen water?
Who's ever heard of frozen water?

126
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,840
Courtney? Courtney,
bring me those images.

127
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,000
What... Oh, okay. I'm coming...

128
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:46,320
Give me that. Oh, that looks cold.
Three umbrellas in one drink?

129
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,760
What kind of extravagant lunatic
are we dealing with?

130
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,880
There goes my toothpaste.
I am tired of this.

131
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:13,640
Yes! Hot shower.

132
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,720
There we go.

133
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,440
Go, Zeta. You killing it.

134
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,120
Go, Zeta. You killing it. Zeta!

135
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,040
Come on, baby.

136
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,640
Go get it. Let's go get it.

137
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,800
Go get the stick.

138
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,360
Oh, my gosh!

139
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,080
I can't do this anymore.

140
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,440
- Okay, Debbie?
- Okay.

141
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,400
I'm done.
I'm done living on this frozen

142
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,240
seal-infested iceberg of an island.

143
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,360
Fire another ice ball!

144
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:11,160
- We can't do that, Zeta.
- Wait...

145
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,960
- You're torturing the engineer.
- Hello?

146
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,000
My limbs are beginning to numb.

147
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,720
Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.

148
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,520
You better tell him
to improve his aim.

149
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,160
It's about time
we start living that good life.

150
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:28,960
- Good life, here we come.
- I deserve to feel the hot sand

151
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,120
squishing between
my beautiful talons.

152
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,080
- You deserve that and more.
- Yes, I do!

153
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,440
Well, here we are.

154
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,560
Are you ready, Red? Love awaits!

155
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,000
- "Speed dating"? No. No way.
- It's mating season.

156
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,400
All right, lovebirds.
You all know how this works.

157
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,000
When you hear this sound...

158
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,720
then it's time
to move on to the next table

159
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,520
where your soul mate
just might be waiting.

160
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,200
Yeah, I'm going home.

161
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,040
Absolutely not.
You have nothing else to do.

162
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,000
Also, I hid your keys
on some part of my body

163
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,920
and I'm not telling you
where unless you stay.

164
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,200
- Yeah, let's party!
- Hey, yo! Chuck's the name.

165
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,856
- Speed's the game. Like games?
- Well...

166
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,576
You entered the love lottery,
and guess what?

167
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,120
You won! Because here I am.

168
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,640
- Hi.
- Hi.

169
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,960
I eat dirt.

170
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,080
Hey, y'all! Who's ready to party?

171
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,480
Not me. No, I'm actually not here

172
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,880
for the whole speed-dating
horror-show thing going on.

173
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,360
Shh. This mating dance is for you.

174
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,040
I'd love to hear about you.

175
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,840
What's your favorite sign?
This one's mine.

176
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,600
You know, the flavor can vary greatly

177
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,240
depending on the minerals
in the dirt.

178
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,200
I can tell which kind of worms
have crawled through there.

179
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,040
Or what sort of roly-polies used it
to raise their family in.

180
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,520
- Are you mad?
- No.

181
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,400
- I don't know. You look mad.
- Well, I'm not.

182
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,280
You know what?
Maybe it's your eyebrows.

183
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,480
My eyebrows are fine.
That's just the way I look.

184
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,400
It's like you've got
resting bird face.

185
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,760
Oh, yeah?
Well, you know, that's not a thing.

186
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,720
- Yes!
- I'm not a total animal.

187
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,160
- Amazing.
- But I do enjoy eating dirt.

188
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,360
Okay, worms, birdseed
or just garbage from a dumpster?

189
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,440
I'm sorry, what?

190
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,080
Favorite food, silly. Don't think.
Just answer from your gut.

191
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,240
- Go!
- Toast?

192
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,000
Okay. Toast. Favorite color?

193
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,600
Stupid question. Red, duh.

194
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,440
If you could have one superpower,
what would it be?

195
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,680
To disappear, like, right now.

196
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,640
Okay. What do you do
in your free time?

197
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,320
Yeah, I mean,
I don't really have any free time.

198
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,800
I kinda protect Bird Island
from being attacked

199
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,440
and that's a full-time gig, so yeah.

200
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,360
I thought I heard something
about a truce.

201
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,120
No. A truce, no.
That's not gonna last.

202
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,560
You'll have a lot more free time now
that nobody needs you anymore, so...

203
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,400
Okay. We are done here.

204
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,320
Are you afraid to talk
about your feelings?

205
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,720
Hey. You know, just because
I don't want to talk about them

206
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,840
- doesn't mean I'm afraid.
- Okay. So avoids personal questions.

207
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,400
- Unusually angry.
- Talks to herself.

208
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,936
- Self-esteem issues.
- Doesn't answer own questions.

209
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,200
Left-handed. Probably a witch.

210
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,440
Looks like
we're definitely incompatible.

211
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,240
Oh, and you needed a form
to tell you that.

212
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,696
Okay. Well, I hope you have
better luck annoying the next guy.

213
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,920
I don't need luck. I have a formula.

214
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,760
- Okay. Have a nice life.
- Have fun being alone.

215
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,240
Oh, I will.

216
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,600
There he goes,
like a ship in the night.

217
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:39,480
No rudder, no purpose, no crew.
Well, have a good night.

218
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:22,160
Loser...

219
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,080
Hello!

220
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,600
Look, Red, I know
we've had our differences.

221
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,600
Oh, like when you tried
to eat our young?

222
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,400
I come in peace.

223
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,080
Ouch.

224
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:59,680
Look, I don't want to see your face
any more than you want to see mine.

225
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,360
We're all in danger!

226
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,800
- Yeah. From you.
- Ouch! No, we have a truce.

227
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,160
Didn't you get my note?
It was on a balloon.

228
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,800
Oh, yeah, that's right.
You wanted to talk.

229
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,640
This is not how a truce works.

230
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,480
Just say what you gotta say
and then get out.

231
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,360
Red, we've discovered
that there's a third island

232
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,600
and they're plotting
to destroy us all.

233
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,680
A third island?

234
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Give me one reason
why I should believe you.

235
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,160
Haven't you noticed any strange
objects falling from the sky?

236
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,840
Giant balls of ice?

237
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,600
<i>But you'll look sweet, upon the seat</i>

238
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,680
<i>Of a...</i>

239
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,960
<i>Bicycle built for two</i>

240
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,680
Nope, nothing. Haven't seen anything.

241
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,240
Well, I have,
and I'll show you the proof.

242
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,480
Squeal Team Six!

243
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,360
What the...

244
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,800
Hey... easy... Stop. Everybody, stop.

245
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,680
That image in your hand
is Eagle Island

246
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,160
- and those are eagles.
- Eagles?

247
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,120
- How did you get these?
- From a drone.

248
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:27,600
- And do you spy on us with that?
- Yes. So have you seen me...

249
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,720
Yes, and it's disgusting.
Red, this is bigger than pranks.

250
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,400
We need to put aside our differences
and work together.

251
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,640
To save our whole world
from being destroyed.

252
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,720
- Red!
- Red!

253
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,040
What we really need is a hero.

254
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,440
- I'm in.
- Wonderful!

255
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,120
We'll have to get a team together.

256
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,040
Yes, we will.
But, hey, I'm in charge.

257
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,560
Actually,
that position's been filled.

258
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,600
- Boo-yah!
- Yeah. By me.

259
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,400
Oh, man, you're gonna love this guy.
Not the smartest bird in the tree

260
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,440
but what he lacks in smarts,
he makes up for in firepower.

261
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,240
Happy birthday!

262
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,160
<i>We've got a number two
at the Porta Potty.</i>

263
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,120
All right, I'm going!

264
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,640
We're busting you out.

265
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,760
How?

266
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,280
Like that.

267
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,640
Oh, I love it.

268
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,520
Bomb, what was that noise?

269
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,880
You're still grounded!

270
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,400
- I'm an adult, Mom!
- Run.

271
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,280
Bomb, get back here!

272
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,040
This guy is so fast, he can
beat time itself in a footrace.

273
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,320
Hey, Chuck, we're putting
together a team.

274
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,840
And I think we're on it!

275
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,680
Come on, everybody.
Let's work those booties!

276
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,320
I'm in.

277
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,640
- Great!
- But how did you...

278
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,520
BT-dubs, you misspelled "heist."

279
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,736
It's "E-I," not "I-E."
I corrected it.

280
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,096
Don't worry.
It's a common misperception.

281
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,440
Well, thank you.

282
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,240
You're right. He's fast.

283
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,960
<i>Now, this guy is kind of a ding-dong</i>

284
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,960
<i>but he's the only eagle we know.</i>

285
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:41,640
Well, you've come to the right eagle.
Tell me more.

286
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,776
{\an5}It's a really exciting mission

287
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,840
{\an5}to a place called Eagle...

288
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,360
- Eagle Island?
- Yes. So you've heard...

289
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,320
Heard of it?

290
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,040
Nice to meet you!

291
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,480
Okay, so now we just need
to figure out

292
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,520
how this volcanic
superweapon works, huh?

293
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:04,000
We're gonna need some kind of
engineering wizard brainiac.

294
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,280
Yes, Chuck. You obviously have
something you want to say or sing.

295
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,560
I have got just the guy.
It's a girl. My sister, Silver.

296
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,480
She goes to Avian Academy,
top of her class.

297
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,360
- She would be perfect.
- Yeah, she totally would.

298
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,800
- See you at the dorm!
- Yeah, see you, Ella.

299
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,440
Hey, good catch!

300
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,960
I mean, we all just thought
she was weird, you know?

301
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,696
But before I knew it,
she skipped four grades

302
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,280
won an Junior Engineer
of the Year Award

303
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,880
and got a scholarship
at Avian Academy.

304
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,320
Perfect. That is exactly
what we're looking for.

305
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,360
You are absolutely gonna love her.
But don't love her too much.

306
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,320
That's my sister, Red. Or I'll crush
every bone in your body!

307
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:47,880
Oh, Frisbee!

308
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,840
Hi, I'm Chuck.

309
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,201
Do you happen to know where
the Engineering Department is?

310
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,400
With a combination of over 30 silk

311
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,640
wire and cotton-based
threads spun together

312
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,040
I now present to you... Super String!

313
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,280
- I said, "It's Super String!"
- More like "Stupid String."

314
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,120
I know what you're thinking, Mike.

315
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,000
You're like,
"What's so super about it?"

316
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,320
Great question, Mike.

317
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,960
Well, how about that
it's very easily able to withstand

318
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:20,240
the pull of 18,000 more kilos
than any other string known to...

319
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,720
Snooze alert.

320
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,960
Known to bird-kind!
Or pig-kind, for that matter.

321
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,960
- What's up, sis?
- Chuck?

322
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,016
- I'm so happy to... It's really...
- I'm so happy to... It's really...

323
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,720
- Great to... Jinx...
- Great to... Jinx...

324
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,920
- Jinx!
- Jinx. One, two, three. I win!

325
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,280
You can't speak
until someone says your name.

326
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,600
Hello? You in here? Hello?

327
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,440
- You?
- You?

328
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:51,080
- You.
- Wait. You know this guy?

329
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:56,080
- I would answer, but you jinxed me.
- Oh, okay, Chuck, I unjinx you.

330
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,600
This is one of my best buddies, Red.
And these are the guys.

331
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,880
- Hi.
- We're the guys.

332
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,040
Guys, this is Silver, the greatest
kid sister in the world.

333
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,200
I'm not exactly a kid anymore, Chuck.

334
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,000
- Oh, you'll always be my kid sister!
- Okay. Hey, everyone.

335
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,680
You know, I just don't think
this is gonna work.

336
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,920
It's just that I'm not sure you're
gonna be compatible with the team.

337
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:19,480
Oh, wow, it is such a pleasure
to meet not you, but you!

338
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,080
I've never met a pig before.

339
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,880
Your technological achievements
are amazing.

340
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,480
- May I shake your hoof?
- Why, thank you. I like her.

341
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,080
- And this has to be Bomb.
- How'd you know that?

342
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,240
'Cause you have a fuse
coming out of your head.

343
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,720
Oh, so cool!

344
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,040
- Backflip.
- So I...

345
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,640
I hear you're some kind
of engineering wizard or whatever.

346
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,320
Oh. I mean,
I don't like to brag, but...

347
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,480
Wait. Who's that? And why is she
all over these achievement awards?

348
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,280
- The kid's amazing, right?
- Not a kid anymore, Chuck.

349
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,680
Tickle Train arriving
at Sister Station!

350
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:04,320
Chuck, no. I am a serious academic.
I am a serious...

351
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,680
Stop!

352
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,760
Oh, look how cute this is.

353
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,920
<i>We're sailing in the ocean
We must row, row!</i>

354
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,680
<i>The eggs are in our sights
And we must go, go!</i>

355
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,000
<i>We'll get them back
Before our parents</i>

356
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,560
<i>Know! Know!</i>

357
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,600
<i>And save the day like Red
The real hero, row!</i>

358
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,840
Gotcha!

359
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,400
We did it. That was so easy!

360
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:41,040
- Yeah! A little too easy, actually.
- What do you mean by that?

361
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,760
Well, normally,
when things are this easy

362
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,440
some dramatically unexpected
setback occurs.

363
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,960
- I don't get it.
- Me neither.

364
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,160
Well, it's kind of hard to explain.

365
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,800
But it's sort of like,
you know how some...

366
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,280
- Oh, see? Like that.
- Are you freaking kidding me?

367
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,120
Each of you has been selected

368
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,600
because you're the best
in your field.

369
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,960
That we could find.

370
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,840
Your skills will be
put to the test facing this.

371
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,320
As you can clearly see,
this is a vol...

372
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,720
Volcano. "A volcano" is
what my assistant was going to say.

373
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,360
- Assistant? You're the assistant!
- Let go...

374
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,536
- No, I'm the leader.
- I'll take that.

375
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,200
Actually, it's a composite volcano.

376
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,040
You can tell by the height and
the clearly apparent vent clusters.

377
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:43,080
Okay, forget I said "volcano."
This is a... it's a superweapon!

378
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,200
Weird, because it looks
just like a volcano.

379
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:51,560
Yep, and here's the scary part.
This is their psychotic leader!

380
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,000
How'd that get in there? Next.

381
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,400
- Oh, butt shot.
- Next. No. Next...

382
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,960
{\an5}I don't even know
what I'm looking at.

383
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,280
{\an5}- Courtney!
- I mean, you took 'em.

384
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,280
This is their psychotic leader.

385
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,360
- Hey. Buddy, do you know her?
- What? Me? No.

386
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,816
No, definitely not, absolutely not.

387
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,280
Never seen her before in my life.
Who is that? I don't know!

388
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,720
Not terribly convincing,
but moving on.

389
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,760
Great. What's the plan?

390
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,856
All right, here's what
we're looking at, folks.

391
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,440
Step one, travel undetected
to Eagle Island.

392
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:41,000
Step two, we're gonna break
into the superweapon.

393
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,320
- Got it.
- Yeah...

394
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,760
And step three...

395
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,160
deactivate the superweapon
once we break in there.

396
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,320
No plan...

397
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,120
Hopefully, before both our islands
are destroyed and we all die.

398
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,440
So that's... that's it.

399
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,000
Right. So, I just
have a few questions.

400
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,600
Why? I explained everything.
It's a foolproof plan.

401
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,480
Yeah. How do we
sneak onto the island?

402
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,776
What exactly is the superweapon
and how do we deactivate it?

403
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,176
And when you say "escape,"
how do you plan to do that, exactly?

404
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,296
Because I feel like this is
a crucial thing to figure out.

405
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,480
- I agree. Why isn't she in charge?
- Told you she's super smart.

406
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,200
Hey, guys, hold on a second, please.

407
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,600
- Mighty Eagle?
- What? What are you looking at?

408
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:22,560
- Do you have an Eagle Island map?
- What? No. No, there's no map.

409
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,560
- Oh, it's a map.
- Yeah, that's a map.

410
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:28,080
- Okay, I just wanna read it.
- Wait a minute.

411
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,000
- Do you guys hear that?
- Do we hear what?

412
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,520
Sounds like a... like a whistle.
It almost sounds like a...

413
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,200
- Hey, guys?
- Run!

414
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,080
Emergency exit, all the way down!

415
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,960
Well, that's not safe. Wait! Stop!

416
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,840
- Holy macaroni!
- Oh, boy.

417
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,000
Everyone, hop on!

418
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,160
Rewind it... Play it again...

419
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,520
Yes, baby!

420
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,400
We knocked the top right off of that!

421
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,320
Glenn, you didn't
mess it up this time.

422
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,480
- Boom! Up top. Or not.
- Nailed it!

423
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,680
- Jerry, up top.
- That should send him running.

424
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:27,600
Wait. "Him"? Who you sending running?

425
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,400
Yeah. Who's "him"?

426
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,400
"Them." I said "them."

427
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,600
- Stop asking me stupid questions.
- I'm so sorry.

428
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,160
- Wow.
- That was crazy. We could have died.

429
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,280
Thanks for saving our lives,
Mighty Eagle!

430
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,480
Well, you can always count on...

431
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,640
Everyone, grab the map!

432
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,760
Hey, it's working.

433
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,720
Left! Left! Lean to the left!

434
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,296
Please tell me that was
the sound of your pants ripping.

435
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:15,240
- I don't wear pants!
- None of us wear pants!

436
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,680
Eight-point-one seconds.

437
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,840
Silver! No!

438
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,320
Hey! What is this?

439
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,400
Oh, well, I mean, she was, you know

440
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,440
just thanking me
for saving everyone, so...

441
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,720
I'm sorry. Saving everyone?

442
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,920
- Yeah. The map was my idea.
- It ripped.

443
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,360
Yeah, maybe because
there's too many birds on the team.

444
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,440
I...

445
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,400
My mountain!

446
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:20,960
- We are in trouble.
- We gotta stop that superweapon.

447
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,080
Jinx!

448
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,840
- Oh, this is bad.
- This is really bad.

449
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,440
Eagle Mountain?

450
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:30,840
Are we gonna be okay?

451
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,840
Oh, my gah.

452
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,480
What happened to Eagle Mountain,
Mom?

453
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,880
Wait a minute. Wait...

454
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,760
Why isn't anybody leaving?
Why are they not scared?

455
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,600
Okay. Oh, okay...
Here's what we gonna do.

456
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,160
I want y'all to take all of those
ice balls and fill them up with...

457
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,000
Molten lava.

458
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,200
That's not possible.

459
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,840
What, you've never heard
of thermal emulsifiers?

460
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,600
Well, yes...

461
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,880
You just gotta get a polyacrylamide
to enhance the nanoparticle

462
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,280
and surfactant association
between the two materials.

463
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,680
Okay.

464
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,080
So you do that,
and I'm gonna go feed my baby.

465
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,600
Yes, I'm finally gonna feed my baby.

466
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:22,080
There you go. Who's my baby?
You're my baby.

467
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,280
What? Don't...
You better not wink at me.

468
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,800
Don't you wink at me.

469
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,320
Who could have done this?

470
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,480
- I can't believe it.
- Are we gonna be okay?

471
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,320
- What are we gonna do?
- All right, guys, do not worry.

472
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,400
We got this.
Red here has got your back.

473
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,200
- And your front and your sides.
- And my floof?

474
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:51,200
- Yeah, even your cute little floof.
- Looks like you're gonna be okay.

475
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:55,400
So are you a hundred-percent sure
we shouldn't evacuate?

476
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,800
No, Red's gonna take care
of us. Right, Red?

477
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,280
Yes! Everybody, please,
just stay calm.

478
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,240
- Great news! Thank you!
- We're gonna be okay. Red's here.

479
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,520
- We love you, Red!
- We need you, Red!

480
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,400
Oh, thank you.
Your support means the world to me.

481
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,520
Okay, Leonard, so where's our ride?

482
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,800
- It's so cute.
- Wow. Okay.

483
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,000
And how are we all
supposed to fit in...

484
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,400
Oh, I think we'll manage. Boop.

485
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,240
Whoa, okay.

486
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,800
Oh, my gah...

487
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,320
All aboard!

488
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:48,160
Anyone want to grab
their own bag or anything?

489
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,800
Don't screw this up, Red!

490
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,520
If we die, it's kind of your fault.

491
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,640
I got this.

492
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,200
Wow.

493
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,160
Ladies and gentlemen

494
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:01,920
I'd like to introduce you
to our master of gadgetry...

495
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,440
- Garry!
- Garry!

496
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,720
This is it?

497
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,560
This is the amazing team I've been
working around the clock for?

498
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,560
Working with what we got.

499
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,960
Well, that's disappointing.

500
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,600
Wow. Okay.

501
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:22,240
This is the part
where you get up and follow me!

502
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:28,600
- Welcome to my piggy gadget lab.
- Oh, yeah.

503
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:31,520
Everywhere you look,
you'll see inventions being tested

504
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,720
by my team of guinea pigs.

505
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,120
- This is so cool.
- I know, right?

506
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,520
All of the gadgets
have been designed specifically

507
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:44,400
with your current mission in mind.
The first being Invisa-Spray.

508
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,240
Need to go undetected in plain sight?

509
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:51,440
- Invisa-Spray does exactly that.
- Wow, I'm invisible!

510
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,960
- Whoa.
- "Whoa," indeed.

511
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,080
That's amazing.

512
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,800
How long does
the invisibility last for?

513
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,920
- Forever.
- Wait, what?

514
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,360
Tina, we're not gonna be able
to see each other tonight.

515
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,320
And what does the next gadget do?
Like, bury us alive?

516
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,880
What? That would be ridiculous.

517
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,080
Ix-nay the shovel-ay.
And moving right along.

518
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,840
- What are you guys doing?
- This is so fun!

519
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,160
Oh, it's so squishy.
What is this stuff?

520
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,920
Oh, well, that is a special type
of flame retardant

521
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,680
we call "Pig Snot."

522
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,920
Why do you call it...
You know what? Never mind.

523
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,720
- Yeah! Lick it.
- Now, everyone, prepare yourselves

524
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,320
'cause this next one
is really something special.

525
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,880
So shiny.

526
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:49,560
Yes, my friend. Bold yet sleek.
Simple while complex.

527
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:55,080
This device can detect an eagle
anywhere within a 100-foot radius.

528
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,880
- Well, how does it work?
- Simply push this button

529
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,280
and it does the rest.

530
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:11,160
<i>There's an eagle nearby...</i>

531
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,160
<i>There's an eagle nearby...</i>

532
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,080
<i>- There's an eagle nearby...</i>
- Why, yes. Clearly, there is.

533
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,440
- Okay, you got me, guys.
<i>- There's an eagle nearby...</i>

534
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,320
- This clever thing will...
<i>- There's an eagle nearby...</i>

535
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,496
- no doubt prove to be...
<i>- There's an eagle nearby...</i>

536
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,600
crucial during your mission.

537
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,040
<i>- There's an eagle nearby.</i>
- Wonderful. That's amazing!

538
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,176
<i>- There's an eagle nearby.</i>
- Can you turn it off now?

539
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,376
<i>- There's an eagle nearby...</i>
- Actually, it'll turn itself off.

540
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,480
Oh, thank goodness.

541
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,640
One hour after it doesn't detect
any more eagles.

542
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:41,240
- What?
<i>- There's an eagle nearby...</i>

543
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:44,200
<i>- There's an eagle nearby...</i>
- Hey!

544
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,360
- There.
- Oh, thank you.

545
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,800
Okay, guys,
these gadgets are terri...

546
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,040
Hey, hey, Red, can we chat for a sec?

547
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:56,320
I can tell you're used to running
the show. That's great and all.

548
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,000
But maybe since we're all a team
here, a team you put together

549
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,200
maybe you can try
to be more supportive.

550
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,880
The results might surprise you, huh?

551
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,960
Fine...

552
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,600
Garry. Unbelievable.
Really, really good stuff.

553
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,200
You know what? I'm sure
I can figure out a plan to...

554
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,640
You know, to use all this...
This awesomeness that you've...

555
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:18,840
Bomb!

556
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,800
Hi, Red.

557
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:31,800
How are we ever gonna get up there?

558
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,640
I want my unborn sisters back.

559
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,720
It's just, the eggs are up there,
and we're down here.

560
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,680
Oh, how are we ever
gonna get up there?

561
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,320
You're doing great, Zoe.

562
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,320
Now, hold it tight, okay?

563
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,440
Quick, let some air out!

564
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,960
- It won't untie!
- Okay, let me try.

565
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:28,680
What's... what's the... problem?

566
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,040
Don't worry, guys.
I'll get us out of this.

567
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,880
- The eggs!
- The eggs!

568
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,960
We got you for reals now.

569
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,480
See, I told you
I would get us out of this.

570
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,640
A boa constructor.

571
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,000
It is glorious! I'm a genius!

572
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,840
Yes, I love it! This was my idea.

573
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,960
- Wait...
- Look out!

574
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,560
- I'm burning!
- I told you to look out.

575
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,360
Glenn, I wanted lava balls,
not lava puddles.

576
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,160
- Glenn's messing up.
- I mean, we...

577
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,480
We're very close.
We just need two more weeks.

578
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,600
Two weeks? Two weeks.

579
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,760
It's quite the undertaking.

580
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,960
Okay, okay, you know what?
I'm doing that thing again.

581
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:13,080
That thing, you know, like,
where I'm not quite sure

582
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:17,120
I heard what I think I heard.
Hey, skinny sassy face!

583
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,720
Did you hear "two weeks,"
or did you hear "tomorrow"?

584
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:24,280
- I heard "tomorrow"?
- Fat dude, what did you hear?

585
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,400
- Definitely what you said?
- Okay, you know what I'm gonna do?

586
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,640
I am gonna call
my old engineer, Steve.

587
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,920
And you know what?
You're a lot like him.

588
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,720
<i>Hey, it's Steve!</i>

589
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,480
<i>Sorry, I can't come
to the phone right now</i>

590
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,120
<i>but you know what to do.</i>

591
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,360
Oh, yeah. I had to discipline Steve.

592
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,720
So, what was that
that you had said to me?

593
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,920
Tomorrow.

594
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,480
That's what I thought you said.
See, everybody happy now.

595
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,320
No...

596
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,080
Careful, buddy. That's not...

597
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,320
Okay, guys, let's do this.

598
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,456
- Here we go.
- We got this.

599
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,640
- We got an island to save, kids.
- Two islands.

600
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,600
- We have two islands to save.
- I can't do this.

601
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,080
- I've made a terrible mistake.
- What are you talking about?

602
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,320
Zeta.

603
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,600
- Who is Zeta?
- The leader of the eagles.

604
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,240
The one who's been trying
to destroy our islands.

605
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,320
And my ex-fiancée.

606
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,520
- Wait. What?
- Did you say "fiancée"?

607
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,960
Beyoncé?

608
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,880
And you're just telling us this now?

609
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,880
Better late than never.

610
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:26,160
<i>It was many years ago, in the 1990s.</i>

611
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,280
<i>She was the smartest girl in school.</i>

612
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,800
<i>And I had an incredible
sense of fashion.</i>

613
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:37,080
- Hey.
- <i>It was love at first sight.</i>

614
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,920
<i>"I miss you"</i>?

615
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:56,120
<i>She was the best thing
that ever happened to me.</i>

616
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,520
<i>But since I wasn't quite ready
to mate for life...</i>

617
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:10,320
Oh, wow. An engagement ring?

618
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,560
<i>Naturally, I...</i>

619
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,840
<i>I...</i>

620
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,320
<i>I abandoned her.</i>

621
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:25,200
- How could you leave like that?
- Because I am a coward.

622
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,280
Many of you didn't know that
about me.

623
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,640
Well, actually...

624
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,600
I assume
she's been heartbroken ever since.

625
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,080
It's all my fault.

626
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:35,400
So, this is Beyoncé
we're talking about?

627
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:40,160
You know what? I just remembered.
I have something to do back home!

628
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,840
Thanks for the help.

629
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,720
Well, that got dark.

630
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,160
Okay, gang, listen up.

631
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:22,440
This place is crawling with security,
but if you guys follow me...

632
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:27,280
- Hey, what's going on?
- What do you think, guys?

633
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,360
- Should we show him?
- Show me what?

634
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,040
Harvey!

635
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:34,760
- Super lifelike disguise, right?
- Disguise?

636
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,960
- We thought we'd let you drive.
- And I'm gonna help you pedal.

637
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:42,360
Wait, you guys came up
with this idea without me?

638
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,720
Yeah.

639
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,840
Yeah, well, it's not gonna work.

640
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,120
We think it's our best chance
of getting past the guards

641
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:01,656
- and into the superweapon.
- I'm with Silver.

642
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,816
- Me too.
- Yeah, she's smart.

643
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:05,256
All right, look. Everyone is counting
on me to make sure that...

644
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,120
- Us. Everyone's counting on us.
- Fine. Whatever.

645
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,200
So your plan is to get into
the superweapon with that?

646
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:13,600
Harvey, don't take offense.
He does not mean it.

647
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:15,920
Fine...

648
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:20,440
You know what? I'll just be up here
saving the world.

649
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,720
Just like I should have been
doing this whole time.

650
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,560
Guys? I 100 percent believe in you
and this Harvey idea

651
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:30,360
but I think this one's gonna need me.

652
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,320
Well, they didn't see us.

653
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:46,400
This isn't an "us" thing, Silver.
I've got this covered. Go away.

654
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,176
Is this a good time
to talk about your feelings?

655
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,960
No, it's not a good time!

656
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,160
No, I don't need your help, okay?
I meant to slip. Leave me alone!

657
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,800
Your hat fell off.

658
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,280
Yeah, I got rid of it
because it was getting heavy.

659
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,840
All right, guys, beak action is a go.

660
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,480
- Arms, what say you?
- Armed and ready.

661
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:31,920
- Two fully functional armies.
- Right above our leggies.

662
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,360
Okay, leggies, show me what you got.

663
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,760
- Oh, yeah.
- We got this!

664
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,840
We must look amazing!

665
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:52,200
- Okay, guys, we're going live.
- Come on, Jerry.

666
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:54,320
You know there's no snacking
while we're on duty.

667
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:58,440
- But I had a really small breakfast.
- All right, I'll do the talking.

668
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,960
Hello, fellow eagle guards.

669
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,800
Oh, no. He's doing a voice.

670
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,320
I'm running late to the old job.

671
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,120
Commute was rough today
for some reason.

672
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,480
But the good news is I made it!

673
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:18,920
- Ninety-degree turn. Quick!
- But the good news is I made it.

674
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:23,160
- ID, please.
- ID?

675
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,320
- Not sure I have it on me.
- Act like you're checking pockets.

676
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:28,880
It's stuck!

677
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,080
Stuck?

678
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,520
What the heck are you doing?

679
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,800
<i>Guards, be in on the alert
for a possible intruder.</i>

680
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,400
Wait a minute.

681
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,360
- What's happening? Leonard.
- He's on to us.

682
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,600
We are so dead.

683
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,120
All right.
I know what's going on here.

684
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,120
I'm picking up
what you're putting down.

685
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:51,240
- Jerry, you getting a load of this?
- Yeah, I think I am.

686
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:56,960
Yeah, Jerry, I know
exactly what's going on.

687
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,920
This right here...

688
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:02,800
is obviously...

689
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,560
a new guy!

690
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,040
Yeah, impostors in a costume.
Wait, what?

691
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:12,960
Yeah! You're the new guard
for the east tower.

692
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,320
Yes.

693
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,280
Yes, I am.

694
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,040
I knew it.
Jerry, swipe the new guy in.

695
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:23,240
Okay.

696
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,440
Thank you so much.

697
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,920
Okay, guys, we're in. Oh, yeah.

698
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:33,960
We did it.

699
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:36,520
- Work it.
- Okay.

700
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,600
- Wiggle the butt.
- Oh, yeah.

701
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,120
Come on. Let's go.

702
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:03,400
Get to the top
of the superweapon. Check!

703
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,920
Yay! You did it.

704
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,760
Okay, so how's it looking down there?

705
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,280
Do you see that?

706
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,040
Oh, it's the superweapon.

707
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:19,120
No, the power supply
to the superweapon.

708
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:23,120
All we gotta do is get
down there and cut it.

709
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:25,160
Okay, assuming
we don't get electrocuted

710
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,960
there are guards there,
there and there.

711
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,000
And we don't have enough rope to...

712
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,880
- Watch and learn.
- What? What are you doing?

713
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:35,960
He's not clipped in.

714
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,680
Red, are you crazy?

715
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,720
Trust me. I know what I'm...

716
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:59,560
- So yeah. Rope wasn't long enough.
- I know that.

717
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,560
It wasn't supposed to be.
That's part of my plan.

718
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:04,160
Except I wanted to be over
on that side.

719
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,120
- Okay, but...
- Watch this!

720
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,240
Nope. No.

721
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,880
Hello.

722
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:20,040
Hi. Now, my plan really starts.

723
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,680
- Hi again.
- I swung back to tell you something

724
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,040
but I forgot what it was. Bye.

725
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,520
Got it. Okay, there we go.
There we go. Grip.

726
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,720
Okay...

727
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,000
You hear something?

728
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:46,560
- So you want a push?
- Yes.

729
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,800
Hi. Oh, no. Your feather! The guards!

730
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,760
Watch out.

731
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:01,480
Silver, what are you doing?

732
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,160
Oh, no. Where's Red?

733
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:23,440
Hey, Silver. Check it out.
This is how a hero saves the world.

734
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:30,360
Oh, come on!
Nothing works around here!

735
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:32,160
Now, we escape.

736
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,880
You two are coming with me.

737
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,040
I...

738
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,280
- Nice abs.
- I know.

739
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:53,280
Okay, try zero-zero-zero-zero.
Now try one-two-three-four.

740
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,280
Now, try four-three-two-one.
Try "1-800-OPEN." I don't know.

741
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:00,800
Chuck, what's your birthday?
Nothing's working!

742
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:04,400
Oh, no. Someone's coming.
Quick. Hide.

743
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,000
Ouch.

744
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,240
<i>There's an eagle nearby...
There's an eagle...</i>

745
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,840
All right. You get started
on the lockdown sequence.

746
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,760
- I'm gonna hit the john.
- Yes, sir.

747
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,840
We gotta get that key card.

748
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,720
Okay, Courtney, get that card.

749
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,520
There's something in the way.

750
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:52,280
Chuck, what's going on down there?

751
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,400
There's a divider in the way.

752
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:02,000
Maybe it's on the other side.

753
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,400
Okay, hold on.

754
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:23,640
Pretend to pee-pee.

755
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:42,640
- Oh, no. He's leaving.
- Chuck, get that card.

756
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,040
I got it.

757
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:11,200
Yeah, I'm just gonna... boop.

758
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:28,880
We're home! We're home, everybody.

759
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,480
Yay!

760
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,960
Oh, we missed you so much,
Bird Island.

761
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:45,360
"Bird Island"?
This is Piggy Island, sillies.

762
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,160
Bird Island is way over there.

763
00:53:56,360 --> 00:54:00,800
We're in! Oh, my goodness gravy.

764
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:09,120
- I wanna see.
- No. Hold on!

765
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,640
- I just wanna see.
- We don't have time.

766
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:33,520
What? What's happening?

767
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:36,000
I think he's challenging us
to a breakdance battle?

768
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,160
Oh, it's on!

769
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,440
- What's happening?
- A little popping and locking.

770
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:57,520
A little what?

771
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:00,400
Pop, pop, pop!

772
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:06,080
Hey, handsome.

773
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,400
- Hey.
- Take those two and put them on ice.

774
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,680
They got Red and my sister.
We gotta go.

775
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:14,920
But the superweapon.

776
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,720
That's my sister, mister.
And I'm gonna save her.

777
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,440
Chuck, slow down.

778
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,080
Slow down. Stop.

779
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,080
Oh, yeah!

780
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:53,760
Hey.

781
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,040
Hey. You done?

782
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,400
- What happened?
- Oh, let's see.

783
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,480
Well, you got us captured
and trapped in ice

784
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:03,480
on top of giant pool toys. Good job.

785
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,600
I just thought
that maybe if I could...

786
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:06,680
Stop me?

787
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,040
Yeah, you two lovebirds

788
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,320
just thought y'all could sail
over here and stop me.

789
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,000
- Lovebirds? No way.
- No...

790
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:16,200
- We're barely, like, friend birds.
- So typical.

791
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:19,560
Type-A male
paired with a strong female

792
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:21,920
and you just can't stand it, can you?

793
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,080
- Well, I...
- Let me guess.

794
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,120
You prefer to fly solo.

795
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:29,720
"I have to save everybody
all by myself!"

796
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:33,640
- Just like a man.
- Ouch. That is kind of true, though.

797
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:35,800
Maybe she was
a little clingy at times.

798
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:39,760
Maybe she gave you that engagement
ring a little bit too early.

799
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,720
I don't think she's talking about us.

800
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:44,600
Maybe she's talking about...
Mighty Eagle.

801
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:49,080
- Debbie! Turn on the TV.
- Yeah. Okay...

802
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,720
It's the one
with the red button on top.

803
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:51,960
Okay...

804
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,200
Red, Debbie. What I'm planning to do

805
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:57,200
is take these little-bitty,
undeveloped islands

806
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,640
and turn them
into my own personal paradise.

807
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:06,480
- You're insane!
- I am putting myself first.

808
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:07,600
Because you know what?

809
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,880
I worked hard for it,
and I deserve it.

810
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,000
All I gotta do is clear out
all these inhabitants.

811
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,480
You're a monster!

812
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:18,840
Glenn, show them
what I'm talking about.

813
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:23,200
Excuse me? Are you
getting smart with me right now?

814
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:32,960
<i>I can't believe we're soaring
Through the sky, sky!</i>

815
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:36,720
<i>All thanks to our pig pals
They are cool guys!</i>

816
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:37,920
<i>Guys!</i>

817
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,000
What the heck was that?

818
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:43,240
- Piggy Island?
- Piggy Island?

819
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:45,800
Attention, everyone!

820
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:49,160
It is imperative
that you all run for your lives!

821
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,840
- Bird Island?
- Bird Island?

822
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,520
My mommy and daddy.

823
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:06,840
Terence? Where are the kids?

824
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,280
Where are the kids?

825
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:15,480
I don't understand. I thought
Red was supposed to save us!

826
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,520
Oh, my gah...

827
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:27,880
Oh, my gah.

828
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:35,000
- It actually worked.
- Yes...

829
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:38,280
Those islands are filled
with innocent birds and pigs!

830
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:44,320
You all had the chance to evacuate.
But for some reason, you didn't.

831
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:49,000
So you are a hundred percent sure
we shouldn't evacuate?

832
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:54,360
I am sure. No one needs to evacuate.
Everybody, just stay calm.

833
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,680
Sorry.

834
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,920
Not sorry. I'm truly not sorry.

835
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,200
Dodged that bullet.

836
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:51,760
- This is all my fault.
- Red, it's not your fault.

837
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,600
No. It...

838
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:57,320
It is my fault.
I put myself before everyone else.

839
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:02,880
I was afraid if I wasn't
a hero anymore, they'd all stop...

840
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:06,640
- they'd all stop liking me.
- Oh, Red.

841
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:10,840
So you did all of this because you
were afraid of not being liked?

842
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:12,600
I...

843
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:14,800
Yes.

844
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:19,520
My fellow eagles, who's tired
of living in an icy wasteland?

845
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,120
We are!

846
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,400
What is she doing?

847
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:26,640
Who is tired of sipping hot chocolate
and getting brain freeze?

848
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:29,280
Me!

849
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:34,800
Who's tired of frozen dinners?

850
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:38,120
- Frozen dinners?
- Come on, Bomb, let's go.

851
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:42,800
Who's tired of playing only
Vanilla Ice, Ice-T and Ice Cube?

852
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:44,360
I am.

853
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:49,280
Who wants to live worry-free
under a beautiful tropical sun?

854
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:51,160
Me! I want to be hot!

855
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:55,080
- I want it hot!
- There's no turning back!

856
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,800
The future we deserve
is about to be ours!

857
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:01,680
Glenn! Activate the weapon!
Start the countdown.

858
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:04,600
<i>Ten minutes to launch.</i>

859
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,440
All right, stand back.

860
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,000
- Wait, did you hear that too?
- Bomb?

861
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,080
What in the...

862
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:26,600
- Really, guys?
- What? No. We weren't...

863
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:27,840
Yeah, they were.

864
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:30,680
Guys, why is that clock
counting backwards?

865
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,920
- We've only got 10 minutes.
- It's now or never.

866
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,800
Pig-kind and bird-kind
are depending on us.

867
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:39,240
- What are we gonna do, Red?
- Well, I...

868
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:45,360
I think... in times like these,
we need someone who can lead.

869
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:48,360
We need a hero.
You know what we need?

870
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,080
- We need Silver.
- Huh?

871
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:57,120
- Got any ideas?
- I've got a few, actually.

872
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:02,600
Okay. That's the heart
of the superweapon

873
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:06,200
and if you look closely, you can see
that it's powered by air pressure.

874
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:08,840
Moisture around a composite volcano
instantly vaporizes

875
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:12,040
sending a plume of highly
pressurized steam to the surface.

876
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:15,360
That steam is contained
by the pressure chamber.

877
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,480
And that's the part
we need to destroy.

878
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:20,560
Only problem is,
it's surrounded by armed guards.

879
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:23,480
Bomb. Do you think
you can take out those guards?

880
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:26,280
Some of them look kind of tough.
It won't be easy.

881
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,240
- Yeah, right. Of course. Got it.
- Great.

882
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:31,200
Chuck, I need you to disable
the security cameras.

883
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,040
There's a bunch,
so you'll have to work fast.

884
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:36,000
Fast? Don't even worry about it, sis.

885
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:39,200
Red, you and I have to get inside
one of those ice balls.

886
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:41,800
Inside an ice ball? I...

887
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,720
- Sure. Okay.
- Leonard, Courtney, Garry

888
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:47,160
do you see that giant lever
near the orange lava tube?

889
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:48,240
Copy that.

890
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:49,736
I need you
to pull it all the way down.

891
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,640
That will create a ramp, so when Red
and I roll down in the ice ball

892
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:54,896
we'll be launched through the air
at the perfect trajectory

893
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:56,360
to take out the superweapon.

894
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:58,360
- Got it?
- Now you're talking.

895
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:01,240
- Great plan, Silver.
- Mama would be so proud.

896
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:03,640
Okay, everyone put your wings
and hooves in.

897
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,720
- Go, team!
- Go, team!

898
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:21,520
Chuck, let us know
when you've disabled the cameras.

899
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:23,320
Okay. On it.

900
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:28,240
Easy, boys.

901
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,480
- Hey, Jerry.
- Yeah?

902
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:48,640
- Come here. Look at this.
- What's up?

903
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:53,400
It says everything's normal.

904
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,720
Jerry, are you seeing this?

905
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:07,360
- I don't see anything.
- No, not that one. Not over here.

906
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,680
Oh, I think this one's it.

907
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,680
We just need to get over
to that track

908
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:38,160
- and follow it up to the lever.
- Okay.

909
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,560
Don't touch the lava tube.

910
01:04:41,640 --> 01:04:45,560
- I don't know if I'm gonna fit.
- Just suck in your butt.

911
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,160
Does anyone smell bacon?

912
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:06,320
No one can see me. Light on my toes.

913
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:10,920
<i>I'm sneaking
I'm sneaking up real quiet</i>

914
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:13,720
<i>Who took you out? I don't know</i>

915
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:17,040
<i>'Cause I didn't hear them coming
'Cause they snuck up on me</i>

916
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:18,640
Captain, you seeing this?

917
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:22,840
No one sees me. Take them out.

918
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,520
So, I'm curious. Why didn't you
just team up with Chuck?

919
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:28,800
He's definitely faster than me.
Nope, he's too light.

920
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:31,080
Why not Bomb, then?

921
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:34,920
- You know, he's heavier than me.
- Too slow. You're perfect.

922
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,360
Oh, that's funny.
I thought we weren't compatible.

923
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,120
Yeah. Well, you know...

924
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,880
Some of the variables changed, so...

925
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:48,200
Oh, variables, huh?
So, uh, what are we doing here?

926
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:52,480
- We're on a mission.
- Oh, yeah, the mission. Of course.

927
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:56,560
Okay, Bomb, we are in position.
Time to take out those guards.

928
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:59,440
Copy that. Come on, Bomb,
hold it together.

929
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:00,760
Tighten up. You can do this.

930
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:07,320
We got a 10-91G in the control room.

931
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:08,800
Roger that.

932
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:17,640
You can do this, Bomb.
Just take them out.

933
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:19,480
Just take them out!

934
01:06:20,440 --> 01:06:22,560
Thanks for taking us out, man.

935
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,360
Even Glenn's having a good time!

936
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:28,120
<i>Baby shark
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo</i>

937
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:30,560
<i>Baby shark
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo</i>

938
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:32,096
<i>Baby shark
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo</i>

939
01:06:32,120 --> 01:06:34,120
<i>- Baby shark...</i>
- All together!

940
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,840
Silver, baby sharks
have taken the bait.

941
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:39,680
Roger that.
Okay, Leonard. Time for Plan X.

942
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,880
<i>Plan X? I thought you said "spandex."</i>

943
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,520
- Spandex?
- Spandex?

944
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:52,520
Well, I'm working with what I got.
Looking good, guys. Looking good.

945
01:06:54,560 --> 01:06:57,360
- You gotta swing your arms.
- I am swinging my arms.

946
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:58,720
I'm swinging them like this.

947
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:09,000
Yes!

948
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:13,880
Three minutes to launch.
Debbie, we are starting over, girl.

949
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:16,720
- This is like New Year's.
- Oh, my gosh, yes, okay.

950
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,760
I'm gonna get some glitter
and decorations.

951
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:20,600
This is gonna be so much fun!

952
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:30,040
Zeta! We have a problem.

953
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:32,160
Oh, my good...

954
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:34,960
Go find them!

955
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:40,960
Okay. That's where
the ice balls are made.

956
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:44,560
We've gotta jump in that hole

957
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:47,120
at the exact moment
that the jaws open up.

958
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,280
- Are you sure about this?
- Actually, no.

959
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:51,720
- Going with my gut this time.
- Didn't expect that.

960
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:56,120
<i>Attention, all eagles.
The prisoners have escaped.</i>

961
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:57,440
<i>Daddy shark...</i>

962
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:59,240
All right, guys, back to work!

963
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:02,120
- Go! Let's do this!
- Guys, hold on!

964
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:05,160
We're not done hanging out
and having a good time.

965
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:06,920
Silver, we've got a problem.

966
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,200
<i>Back to work
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo</i>

967
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:10,280
<i>Back to work...</i>

968
01:08:10,360 --> 01:08:12,240
- We'll jump on the count of three.
- Got it.

969
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:13,920
One, two...

970
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:16,120
three!

971
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:32,320
- It worked! Red?
- We did it!

972
01:08:37,640 --> 01:08:40,160
- Oh, no. What the...
- Lava injectors!

973
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,200
I got this one.

974
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,000
Red!

975
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:56,400
Well, it's all downhill from here.

976
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:04,160
- Okay, now what?
- If my calculations are correct

977
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:06,840
we should be tall enough to reach
that lever if all three of us...

978
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:09,040
Garry?

979
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:16,120
Hang in there!

980
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:23,080
Okay, new plan.

981
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:25,160
We need to get to 65 miles per hour.

982
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:26,640
Left, right, left, right.

983
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:28,536
At least we're gonna get
all our steps in today.

984
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:31,720
- <i>Two minutes to launch.</i>
- Two minutes, everybody!

985
01:09:31,800 --> 01:09:34,200
Two minutes to launch!

986
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:35,896
- Left, right, left, right.
- Left, right, left, right.

987
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:38,560
We gotta break that superweapon!

988
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:40,400
- Leonard.
<i>- Yeah?</i>

989
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:41,600
Is the ramp elevated?

990
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:42,720
We're working on it.

991
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,120
What are we gonna do?

992
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:49,400
- Okay, let's just figure this out.
- I have an idea.

993
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:51,240
Yeah. Now is not the time, Courtney.

994
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:54,320
I'm just trying to figure out how
we're gonna get up to that lever.

995
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:58,080
- Hey. Leonard.
- Oh, that could work!

996
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:00,640
Silver! How are we doing on speed?

997
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:02,640
We're maxing out
at 59 miles per hour.

998
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:04,560
We need to get to 65!

999
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:09,800
- It's stuck! We need more weight!
- Okay. Here goes.

1000
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:12,960
It's moving!

1001
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:16,640
Oh, that's not good.

1002
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:25,120
63, 64...

1003
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:27,920
- One more minute!
- Yes!

1004
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,280
- <i>One minute.</i>
- Let's just clear these houses

1005
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:31,880
from your beachfront view.

1006
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:35,320
- The lever is broken!
- Broken?

1007
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,560
Leonard, don't you have
any gadgets you can use?

1008
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:41,240
- We're almost to the ramp.
- Gadgets? Gadgets!

1009
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:45,040
- Forty-five seconds.
- Attention, all personnel.

1010
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:47,880
- Initiating launch sequence.
- <i>Initiating.</i>

1011
01:10:47,960 --> 01:10:50,160
Garry, any way
you can bring me the gadgets?

1012
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:53,960
No, there isn't.

1013
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:57,760
- <i>Chuck, I need Garry's backpack.</i>
- On it.

1014
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:01,200
- Garry, where are you?
- Chuck, over here!

1015
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,520
Yes! We've reached 65 miles per hour!

1016
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:13,640
- Fifteen seconds.
- Let's do this!

1017
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:20,080
- <i>14, 13, 12, 11...</i>
- Ten. Nine...

1018
01:11:20,160 --> 01:11:21,800
- Leonard, it's now or never.
- Oh, no.

1019
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:23,880
- Got to raise that ramp!
- Seven.

1020
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:30,560
Six, five, four, three, two...

1021
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:33,360
and one!

1022
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:37,160
<i>There's an eagle nearby...</i>

1023
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:39,880
- Yeah!
- <i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

1024
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:50,440
No!

1025
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:59,720
That's my sister!

1026
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:12,520
- It didn't work?
- I... I don't get it.

1027
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,000
Of course, it didn't work.

1028
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:20,600
You must really love
your little islands

1029
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:23,360
to risk your lives
trying to save them!

1030
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:27,120
Well, guess what? I don't care.

1031
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:31,520
Because this right here
is ice-cold, baby.

1032
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:34,680
No!

1033
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:36,200
- Zeta!
- What?

1034
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:37,600
Wait!

1035
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,600
What?

1036
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:41,200
- Mighty Eagle!
- Yeah!

1037
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:53,360
I'm the cause of all this.
I ran out on you on our wedding day.

1038
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:57,240
And ever since then,
you've been tormented inside.

1039
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:59,320
Right now? This is when
you choose to do this?

1040
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:02,840
So, take me! Not these islands.

1041
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:06,560
You have got some flipping nerve!

1042
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:10,280
I know! I ripped your heartstrings
right out.

1043
01:13:10,360 --> 01:13:13,240
- That's it. Super String.
- What?

1044
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:15,880
Has been burning a hole
in your sanity!

1045
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:19,840
{\an5}- Set yourself free...
- Okay, I'm seeing it. Yeah.

1046
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:22,960
- Go ahead. Do your worst to me.
- Chuck.

1047
01:13:23,760 --> 01:13:25,280
I deserve it.

1048
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:29,440
- You think this is about you, Ethan?
- Ethan?

1049
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:33,480
Oh, that is so hilarious
slash embarrassing

1050
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:37,160
slash I hadn't thought
about your fat butt in 20 years.

1051
01:13:37,240 --> 01:13:38,480
Wait, what?

1052
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:42,920
You are a lazy,
uncoordinated, fish-eyed fool.

1053
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:44,840
You ain't worth the salt
in your bread.

1054
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,600
You are nothing to me!
You are nothing!

1055
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:48,296
I don't think about you at all.

1056
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:49,880
I don't think about
your stinking feet.

1057
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:51,800
I don't think about your rusty hands.

1058
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:53,440
I don't think about
your rusty elbows...

1059
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:56,440
Wait, so you have
or you haven't thought about me?

1060
01:13:56,520 --> 01:14:00,320
News flash, bro,
I am over you, I'm over this place

1061
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:02,640
and I am ready
to get that upgrade situation

1062
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:05,680
- going for me and my daughter.
- Hey.

1063
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,640
- Well, our daughter.
- What?

1064
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:17,960
- That's my dad?
- I have a daughter?

1065
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:19,720
Yes, you do!

1066
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:23,800
And I raised her all by myself
in this icy wasteland.

1067
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:26,240
But now I'm gonna be
sipping piña coladas

1068
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:31,040
on those warm tropical islands
like I deserve to!

1069
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:35,880
- Stop!
- Oh, no.

1070
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,120
- Hey, it's working!
- Yes!

1071
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:49,880
Oh, no.

1072
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:51,840
I gotcha!

1073
01:14:57,040 --> 01:15:00,000
- You can do it!
- Hold on to that string!

1074
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:03,880
- The hatchlings.
- Oh, no! They're in trouble!

1075
01:15:15,280 --> 01:15:16,640
Jump!

1076
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:24,360
- Everyone...
- Run!

1077
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:28,080
- Let's go!
- No, wait. This is not happening.

1078
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:36,120
Gotcha!

1079
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:43,080
- I'm freaking out!
- Me too!

1080
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:11,800
- We did it.
- We did it.

1081
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:17,680
Debbie? Where is she?
Where's Debbie? Debbie?

1082
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:23,040
Debbie, no.

1083
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:33,880
What have I done?

1084
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:37,400
Oh, Debbie.

1085
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,160
Are you okay?

1086
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:51,320
Sweetie? Honey pie?

1087
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:53,400
Love of the last one minute
of my life?

1088
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:58,880
- Dad?
- Yes.

1089
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:03,240
You are so strong! He saved my life!

1090
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:05,160
Oh, Debbie.

1091
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:11,120
Mom, can we keep him? Please?

1092
01:17:11,200 --> 01:17:13,320
Oh, I...

1093
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:17,680
Wait... Before you answer,
you should see something.

1094
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:22,040
Wait...

1095
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:26,880
And the one closest to my heart.

1096
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:32,320
<i>I don't want to wait</i>

1097
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:35,680
<i>For our lives to be over</i>

1098
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:38,920
<i>Will it be yes, or will it be</i>

1099
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,440
<i>Sorry?</i>

1100
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:42,600
Oh, no.

1101
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:45,080
<i>Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo</i>

1102
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:48,120
<i>Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo</i>

1103
01:17:48,200 --> 01:17:50,360
You are so pitiful.

1104
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:51,960
<i>Yeah</i>

1105
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,120
I've never been to a wedding before!

1106
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:57,240
Oh, okay, who's
getting married again?

1107
01:17:57,320 --> 01:18:00,120
Oh, Terence, this is like
our wedding, but expensive.

1108
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:04,240
Flowers for you...

1109
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:07,120
Ladies and gentlemen, birds and pigs

1110
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:10,360
we are gathered here today
because of these two characters.

1111
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:14,200
Not only because they're being
joined in holy matrimony

1112
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:17,440
but also because one of them
tried to destroy our islands

1113
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:20,320
for her own selfish reasons.
Guess who.

1114
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:24,240
- Oh, it's such a beautiful wedding.
- It really is.

1115
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:27,280
But Mighty Eagle swooped in
at the last second

1116
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:29,520
and got all the credit
for stopping her.

1117
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:31,080
Yes, you did, baby.

1118
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:34,200
- I love you.
- Wrap it up.

1119
01:18:34,280 --> 01:18:37,200
I now pronounce you
eagle and husband.

1120
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:39,400
- You may now kiss the...
- Come here, you.

1121
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:44,360
All right. Get it, Mighty Eagle.
Oh, that is disgusting!

1122
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:46,680
Go, Zeta! Go, Dad!

1123
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:49,600
Attention! Attention, everybody.
Eyes on me.

1124
01:18:49,680 --> 01:18:53,720
Hi... Look up here.
I would like to propose a toast

1125
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:56,640
to the bird who made
all of this possible.

1126
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:00,280
Our hero, Red.

1127
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:03,000
- Give it up for Red!
- Yeah! Red!

1128
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:04,920
- Red!
- Red!

1129
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,576
- You're our hero, Red!
- You're our hero, Red!

1130
01:19:06,600 --> 01:19:08,360
- Red!
- Red!

1131
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:12,000
Easy, guys. Hollow bones.
I've got hollow bones.

1132
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:13,560
- Who loves you, Red?
- Yeah, Red!

1133
01:19:13,640 --> 01:19:16,560
Oh, wow. I mean, thanks, guys. I...
Thank you.

1134
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,600
Speech!

1135
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:27,680
Looks like they still love you, Red.

1136
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:31,520
Okay, well, you know, I'm...

1137
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:35,280
I'm honored, everybody.
Really, I... And I just...

1138
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:42,480
Two seconds. Give me two seconds.
I'll be right back.

1139
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:45,640
Good speech! Yeah!

1140
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:48,160
Excuse me. Pardon me. Excuse me.

1141
01:19:48,640 --> 01:19:50,480
I'm just trying
to squeeze through here.

1142
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:52,720
Hey! Silver!

1143
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:04,280
Wow, I... Thank you, guys.
Thank you for this.

1144
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:06,360
And for all the support and love.

1145
01:20:06,440 --> 01:20:09,600
You know, it means...
Well, it means everything to me.

1146
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:13,720
But, I don't deserve it. She does.

1147
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:15,360
What just happened?

1148
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:17,600
Is that the nerd
from our physics class?

1149
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:20,200
This is the real hero right here.

1150
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:22,200
Silver is the one
who came up with the plan

1151
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:26,600
to stop the superweapon
and ultimately saved all our lives.

1152
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:30,800
Red, I didn't do this all on my own.

1153
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:33,320
Right. 'Cause we're a team.

1154
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:37,840
We couldn't have done anything
without Chuck and Bomb

1155
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:39,880
- or Courtney and Garry.
- Thank you.

1156
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,000
Or Leonard.

1157
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:42,736
Well, you know what?
Actually, we probably could've

1158
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:44,456
done it without Leonard.
Let's be honest, huh?

1159
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:47,320
Leonard's the man!
I did everything! I got the sub!

1160
01:20:47,400 --> 01:20:48,640
And even Mighty Eagle.

1161
01:20:48,720 --> 01:20:50,320
- So handsome.
- Ethan!

1162
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:53,440
And last, but certainly not least,
those adorable hatchlings.

1163
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:58,920
We are strongest
when we all band together.

1164
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,480
Just like Super String.

1165
01:21:00,560 --> 01:21:04,160
- Let's hear it for Silver!
- Yes!

1166
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:05,800
I want to be an engineer.

1167
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:08,760
- All right! Yeah, Silver!
- We love you, Silver!

1168
01:21:08,840 --> 01:21:10,560
- Okay, Garry, now.
- On it.

1169
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:15,240
Oh, my gosh!

1170
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:16,880
- We're famous!
- Oh, wow, look at that.

1171
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,960
Oh, look! It's me!

1172
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:21,600
You see, these guys
are the real heroes.

1173
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:24,480
They're the ones
who deserve your love, not me.

1174
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:30,880
- We love you even more now, Red!
- Yeah, Red! We love you!

1175
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:35,680
- See? You're not in this alone.
- I'm married now.

1176
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,680
Let's party, y'all! I's married!

1177
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:48,320
Debbie, get away
from the punch bowl, girl!

1178
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:50,160
Come over here
and dance with your mama!

1179
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:58,120
- Hey, y'all!
- Mom, watch this!

1180
01:21:58,200 --> 01:22:00,680
Oh, yeah!
Hey, where's Red and Silver?

1181
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:05,440
Okay, worms or birdseed?

1182
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:08,360
Kidding. I know it's toast.

1183
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:09,880
Toast.

1184
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:12,160
You know, I was actually
being sarcastic

1185
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:14,600
when I said that was my favorite
food, just for the record.

1186
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:17,600
What? You? Sarcastic?

1187
01:22:17,680 --> 01:22:19,320
- No way.
- I see what you're doing.

1188
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:21,480
- Okay.
- Maybe you can teach me sometime.

1189
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:24,120
Yeah, maybe I will, when you're not
too busy saving the world.

1190
01:22:24,200 --> 01:22:28,720
You know, I actually just finished
doing that, so I'm pretty free.

1191
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,240
Oh, no way.
Because I'm pretty free too.

1192
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:33,800
Well, I don't have
anything to do either!

1193
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:36,840
Wait a minute. What's that sound?
Tickle Train?

1194
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:38,200
Coming to Third Wheel Station!

1195
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:39,600
- Chuck, no!
- Chuck, no!

1196
01:22:39,680 --> 01:22:43,000
- Jinx...
- Jinx...

1197
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:00,080
Laugh it up, everybody.

1198
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:07,080
- No one can stop me.
- I'll stop you, Zeta.

1199
01:23:08,480 --> 01:23:10,280
Well, you can't stop me from...

1200
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:14,280
showing you how cute my little
sisters are when they're sleeping.

1201
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:15,880
- Yay!
- Yay!

1202
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:29,320
They're so cute.

1203
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:32,320
I kind of thought
they'd be hatched by now.

1204
01:23:34,360 --> 01:23:36,840
- They're hatching!
- Yay!

1205
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:40,840
- Here they come!
- Oh, my gosh! I see one!

1206
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:47,200
- Mama!
- Mama!

1207
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:07,000
Can I help you?

1208
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:11,040
Oh, sorry.

1209
01:24:21,440 --> 01:24:22,960
Mama?

1210
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:28,280
Hi.

1211
01:24:29,280 --> 01:24:32,080
- My baby sisters!
- Yay!

1212
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:39,880
Bye.

1213
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:45,320
Mama!

1214
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:50,240
Oh, baby sisters.
We love you so much.

1215
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:54,160
We should take good care of them
and never let them out of our sights.

1216
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:56,920
Yeah. We'll never let them
out of our sights.

1217
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:02,880
Bye-bye.
