1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,200
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,280
Where are you at?

3
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:04,680
What's green and bad
and goes round and round?

4
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,320
Zebra, with a gaping whore.

5
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,000
You're brilliant mind is as damaged
as the rest of your body.

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,120
I guess she was right.

7
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,120
You're not smart.

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,760
We need an army to take on Penguin.

9
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,360
Makes me miss Falcone.

10
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,840
You came looking for a gangster,
that's exactly what you've found.

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,960
I'm a Falcone.

12
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,120
I need to know
what you're going to do.

13
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,240
You want the city back from Penguin?
I'll give that to you.

14
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,360
Did you really think
I wouldn't figure it out?

15
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,400
The two of you have been whispering
like teenagers for weeks.

16
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:32,920
You never deserved her
in the first...

17
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,400
Yes, I killed him. I am sorry.

18
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,480
There's a legend about this knife.

19
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,200
The man that killed my grandfather
can't have this. I promise.

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,960
That's Ra's al Ghul.

21
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,800
That knife is the key to everything.

22
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,120
Give me the knife
and I will release the boy.

23
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,800
- Bruce, hand me the knife.
- I can't.

24
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,360
- So who's the vegetable?
- Used to be a gangster.

25
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:05,760
Name's Gilzean, maybe Gold.

26
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,880
Hook a slug in the noodle,
then in a coma six months.

27
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,480
So hospital brass wants free up
some beds?

28
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,640
Yeah. Say take him upstate.

29
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,560
Rest in peace, Butch Gilzean.

30
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,320
Cyrus Gold.

31
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,360
Whoever the hell you are.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,200
Hey, Harvey.

33
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,280
Does anyone contacted you

34
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,040
- about Ra's al Ghul?
- No.

35
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,680
I just heard from Judge Bam Bam's
clerk.

36
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,360
His trial got pushed off the docket.

37
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,440
And?

38
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,920
And I wanna make sure him being
minister of a foreign country

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,880
doesn't let him weasel out of this.

40
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,280
- He killed a boy.
- That's above my pay grid, pal.

41
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,440
I just bust the bad guys.

42
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,760
Do you?

43
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,080
These are release forms.

44
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,720
Of my collars. Let me guess,

45
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,760
each one of them has a license
from Penguin, right?

46
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,520
Jim, I am stuck between a rock
and a hard place.

47
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,600
Every move you bust with a license,

48
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,840
the commissioner orders me
to let them go.

49
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,120
- What am I supposed to do?
- Your job!

50
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,640
I am doing my job!

51
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,240
Gordon.
Got a call from the judge's clerk.

52
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,520
It's about Ra's al Ghul.

53
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,320
- Here.
- I am doing my job!

54
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,120
Master Bruce.

55
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,920
No sleep?

56
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,680
Again?

57
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,640
Once more about the boy's death...

58
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,040
Don't say it's not my fault.

59
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,520
It is my fault.

60
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,880
Alex is dead because of I hesitated.

61
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,160
Well, perhaps you did,
but that doesn't make you

62
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,440
his murderer, does it?

63
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,120
Ra's killed that innocent little boy
and he's gonna pay for it.

64
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,480
Do you really think walking out
in black cape will stop him?

65
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,760
He still wants this dagger.

66
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,400
Stop playing on the bloody dagger,
will you?

67
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,720
Just so we can just get
some breakfast, please.

68
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,200
I think I finally found something
at Dr. Winthrop's notes.

69
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,560
There's a description on the handle

70
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,160
that Dr. Winthrop
was able to decipher.

71
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,560
Says the knife is intended
for the one

72
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,240
who has bathe in the healing waters.

73
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,720
Well, assuming that's not me,
that must be our boy Ra's.

74
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,200
But that doesn't have to mean
it's for him to use.

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,880
Perhaps it's to be used against him.

76
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,200
- I see.
- No. You clearly don't.

77
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,680
What you're suggesting is
that knife, that knife alone

78
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,440
is the only thing capable
of doing him in.

79
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,800
If Ra's al Ghul believes
this knife will kill him,

80
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,280
that could explain
why he wants it so bad.

81
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,600
So he can destroy it?

82
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,040
Before someone fulfils the prophecy.

83
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,040
Master Bruce, I know that you feel
bad about Alex, we all do.

84
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,640
But at this point
you must remember your vow.

85
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,720
No killing.

86
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,040
No killing.

87
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,320
Taking a life
never mind how justified

88
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,720
will lead you down a darker path

89
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,560
that you could ever
possibly imagine.

90
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,440
I know, I've been down it.

91
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,840
- Do you understand me, Master Bruce?
- I understand.

92
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,960
Good.

93
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,720
Let's get yourself ready.

94
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,760
Chop-chop.

95
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,720
Such a tragedy.

96
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,280
He was only a child
and was always so lovely.

97
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,360
A heinous crime.

98
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,760
Perpetrated against
such an innocent boy.

99
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,400
And his grandfather,
murdered just the day before.

100
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,160
I'll just be in a moment,
Master Bruce.

101
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,960
Diplomatic immunity?

102
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,440
You are joking, aren't you?

103
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,080
Not to par, abide Embassy file papers
to have him extradited.

104
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,160
Could happen this week.

105
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,560
That monster killed a child.

106
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,160
I know. I was there. Look...

107
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,280
I'm telling you this as a courtesy.

108
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,960
But the news will get out
and when it does,

109
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,680
I need you to watch Bruce.

110
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,960
I'm worried about him.

111
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,200
And you blame me.

112
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,400
You're his guardian, aren't you?

113
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,560
You're supposed to protect him,

114
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,640
instead you've been placing him
in harm's way.

115
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,880
Oh, I see.
So that's the right cause, is it?

116
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,400
Keeping you in the dark.

117
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,800
Well, if I was you
I'd focus on your job, Detective,

118
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,640
which is keeping Ra's al Ghul
behind bars. Tacks-up.

119
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,560
Just keep the news away
from Bruce as long as you can.

120
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,360
On that we agree, Detective.

121
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,480
The boy's been through enough.

122
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,760

124
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,840
{\an5}So, what's the angle?

125
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,480
{\an5}How about this?

126
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,400
{\an5}Say the word, we'll be home

127
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,120
{\an5}drinking Chianti by dinnertime.

128
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,560
{\an5}I think I'll decline.

129
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,160
{\an5}So why did you call me here?

130
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,840
To say goodbye.

131
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,840
{\an5}When I brought you back to life,

132
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,920
{\an5}I asked you to be my eyes
and ears in Gotham.

133
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,920
{\an5}You became so much more.

134
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Save it.

135
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,480
{\an5}What about everything
you promised me?

136
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,520
{\an5}"Do as I ask and I will give you
a gift beyond your imagining."

137
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,760
{\an5}What the hell was that?

138
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,360
{\an5}You'll see.

139
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,600
{\an5}Goodbye, Barbara.

is accounted for under Pax Penguina.

163
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,680
Which means that 14 percent of crime

164
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,920
happens outside
of my licensing system!

165
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,080
The numbers are very good,
Mr. Cobblepot.

166
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,560
Get Firefly. I want examples made!

167
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,680
Yes, that might help.

168
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,840
But, then, if scorching
a few idiots was all it took,

169
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,160
anyone could rule Gotham.

170
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,240
Thank you for your insight,
Miss Falcone.

171
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,560
I don't recall summoning you.

172
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,800
I came to see if you had
lunch plans tomorrow.

173
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,080
An invitation?

174
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,360
After I killed your father's
last remaining loyalists?

175
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,400
Perhaps you overestimate
the pleasure of your company.

176
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,480
Oswald...

177
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,360
...you may think you have everything,

178
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,520
but there is one thing
you don't have.

179
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,160
The Falcone name.

180
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,560
A name that once accounted for
all criminal activity in Gotham,

181
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,120
as in 100 percent.

182
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,320
Now you're just rubbing it in.

183
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,640
I propose we have lunch
somewhere public.

184
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,240
By doing so, you'll show Gotham

185
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,400
that you have the support
of the Falcone family.

186
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,920
And that should be enough to send
those outlying criminal elements

187
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,760
scurrying back under your umbrella.

188
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,040
Mr. Penn, item number four
on my to-do list.

189
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,160
"Kill Sofia Falcone."

190
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,680
Add a question mark, will you?

191
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,440
Tomorrow it is.

192
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,560
Come on, you people have
pills for everything!

193
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,800
Insomnia, anxiety!
You have to have something for me!

194
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,600
I don't know,
a pill to reverse the effect

195
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,760
of having your brain frozen
and unfrozen?

196
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,080
That's kind of specific.

197
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:07,720
I will not be condescended to
by an idiot in a lab coat!

198
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,640
You're not even a doctor!

199
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,680
Okay, relax, man.
Just, tell me your symptoms.

200
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,960
Fogginess of the mind.

201
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,520
Decreased capacity
to think 10 steps ahead.

202
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,560
Inability to solve riddles!

203
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,360
God. I have got to improve
my brain function.

204
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,600
I could take a pill or a vitamin.

205
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,920
I'll even consider a natural remedy.

206
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,080
I don't want to get your hopes up,
but there is something.

207
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,440
What? Tell me.

208
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,240
A trial drug.

209
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,240
It claims to boost
your natural cognitive abilities.

210
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,640
- That's perfect. Where is this?
- The sample drawer.

211
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,360
What is it called?

212
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,640
Smartivia.
Blue pills, diamond-shaped.

213
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,040
Smartivia. Smartivia.

214
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,880
I don't see them.

215
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,080
Try towards the back.

216
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,800
I don't see it.

217
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,960
Oh, here it is.

218
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,200
Oh! God!

219
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,920
A fake gun?

220
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Seriously?

221
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,880
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I just need to know.

222
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,560
- Do these work?
- No, dummy.

223
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,840
They're sugar pills.

224
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,280
And I'm calling the police.

225
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,880
Go on, do it, do it...

226
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,440
Butch.

227
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,080
You know Grundy?

228
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,440
Butch...

229
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,600
I have never had an issue with you.

230
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,160
Barbara Kean, she is the problem.

231
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,400
You and Tabitha
are innocent bystanders.

232
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,080
Wow, you don't get much sun. No...

233
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,280
Man talk too much.

234
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,600
- Collins, deal with this, will you?
- Yep.

235
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,680
Gordon.

236
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,320
Gordon.

237
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,440
- Bruce is gone.
- What?

238
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,040
You've got to get me into Blackgate.

239
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,040
- What are you talking about?
- When we got back from the wake,

240
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,400
he said he was gonna go
straight to bed,

241
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,440
but he must've snuck out
between then and now.

242
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,680
My concern is
that he's taken the knife...

243
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,600
and he's gonna try and kill
Ra's al Ghul.

244
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,280
- You're serious?
- Yes, I'm bloody serious.

245
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,840
We've got to go to Blackgate now.

246
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,880
And then you can tell me
the many ways

247
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,320
I've failed the child, all right?

248
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,120
- Oh, I will.
- Listen to me.

249
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,200
The boy is on the verge
of doing something

250
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,920
that there's no coming back from.

251
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,680
He needs our help.

252
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,040
Right.

253
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,960
Let's go.

254
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,600
Yeah, it's about time.

255
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,840
Shift ended five minutes ago.
Come on.

256
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,880
You weak...

257
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,120
foolish boy.

258
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,800
You're still not ready.

259
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,600
My name is Bruce Wayne. Stop him.

260
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,800
Stop him.

261
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,600
Master al Ghul.

262
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,000
Take him below.

263
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,480
What? What are you doing?

264
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,320
We got your call, but...

265
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,920
I checked the logs,
Bruce Wayne hasn't been here.

266
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,880
With all due respect, I don't think
he'd come as a regular visitor.

267
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,480
He's a billionaire, after all.

268
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,840
I think what Mr. Pennyworth
is trying to say

269
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,720
is Bruce Wayne could have paid
someone to get him in here.

270
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,960
No offense.

271
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,320
We just want to look around.

272
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,440
Sure. Whatever you want.

273
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,600
But you came all the way here
for nothing.

274
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,160
And we're gonna need your weapons.

275
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,840
Standard procedure.

276
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,200
Of course.

277
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,240
- Finished?
- That's absolutely it.

278
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,320
Unless you want to check
my under crackers.

279
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,480
This way.

280
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,640
Under crackers?

281
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,400
They're here.

282
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,320
Sugar pills, my foot.

283
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,160
That dream was horrible.

284
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,440
Oh, God!

285
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,600
Oh, you're real.

286
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,280
You know...

287
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,560
Grundy?

288
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,440
What? No. No.

289
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,520
No, who's Grundy?

290
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,080
Solomon Grundy.

291
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,520
Born on Monday.

292
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,200
Your hand! How...

293
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,880
I'm sorry.

294
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,120
What happened to you?

295
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,800
Grundy not know.

296
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,800
Okay, let me get this straight.

297
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,560
You don't remember...

298
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,440
who you are or how you got here?

299
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,760
I'm sorry.

300
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,320
Grundy, I don't know you.

301
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,560
Best of luck, though. Hope you get
the skin thing figured out. Later.

302
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:09,200
You know Grundy.

303
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,560
You help Grundy.

304
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,800
Be Grundy...

305
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,160
friend.

306
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,880
I'm attempting to be civil...

307
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,600
but I can't help you.

308
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,840
Why?

309
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,640
I just can't, all right?

310
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,080
- Why?
- Because...

311
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,640
- Why?
- Because I can't even help myself!

312
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,400
You don't know who you are.

313
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,880
Well, that makes two of us.

314
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,680
I used to be smart, brilliant...

315
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:45,840
and now that's gone.

316
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,640
I can't even rob a pharmacy!

317
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,040
So you want me to help you?

318
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,200
I can't.

319
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,800
Well, I am feeling a bit peckish.

320
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,200
We are closed.

321
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,280
Janos.

322
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,240
Last I saw you
was at my 10th birthday.

323
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,720
You bought me ruby earrings.

324
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,440
Said it would be a fitting gift

325
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,000
for the daughter
of the king of Gotham.

326
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,480
Sofia Falcone.

327
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,880
I heard you had returned to Gotham.

328
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,960
What can I do for you?

329
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,880
I was wondering how you were faring
under Penguin's rule.

330
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,000
The Szabo family is quite content

331
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,360
under Oswald Cobblepot's
licensing system.

332
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:52,520
But even if we were not,

333
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,600
we would be wise enough
not to say anything.

334
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,360
Good. Because I've invited him
to your restaurant for lunch,

335
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,520
and I want it to be a lunch
he'll never forget.

336
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,560
Bruce.

337
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,320
Where am I?

338
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,880
Beneath Blackgate Penitentiary.

339
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,000
Alfred Pennyworth and Jim Gordon
are upstairs...

340
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,440
in the company, unbeknownst to them,
of my men.

341
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,560
Let them go.

342
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,080
They have nothing to do with this.

343
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,560
Still playing
the white knight, Bruce.

344
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,640
You replaced the guards
before I got here.

345
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,000
I'm sure your friends
can fend for themselves.

346
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,920
You applied for diplomatic immunity,
knowing I'd hear about it

347
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,360
and come for you.

348
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,480
I wanted the knife,

349
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,920
but not for the reason you think.

350
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:09,160
It's been ages
since I first held this dagger.

351
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,040
It was given to me moments
after I was bathed

352
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,320
in the Lazarus Pit.

353
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,600
Submerged in the waters...

354
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:31,840
suspended between life and death,

355
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,440
I saw a vision of you...

356
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,080
my heir.

357
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,440
You're insane.

358
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,320
I'm not your heir. I don't even
understand what that means.

359
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,760
It means that you are the only one

360
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,160
who can end my suffering.

361
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,080
Please.

362
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,960
You want me to kill you?

363
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,680
Set me free.

364
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,240
Well, thanks for the snack, big guy.

365
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,160
It's been an emotional day.

366
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,840
I got to go.

367
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,920
No.

368
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,920
Not this again. Come on!

369
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,440
God, I've told you,
I'm better off on my own,

370
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,840
and you are, too.

371
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,120
So let go! Let go!

372
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,200
Hey, freak.

373
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,960
I knew we'd find you.

374
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,560
And it looks like you got a friend.

375
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,080
I assure you, we are not friends.

376
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,720
Get 'em. Both of 'em.

377
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,800
No! No!

378
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,840
Grundy!

379
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,000
Hot, hot!

380
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,240
Grundy friend, help!

381
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,720
Don't leave, no. Help. Help.

382
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,800
Hot.

383
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,600
Hot, hot.

384
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,360
Grundy friend not dumb.

385
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,040
Grundy friend, smart.

386
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,840
Well, I guess...

387
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,960
yeah, you're right.

388
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,040
Water beats fire.

389
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,480
That was smart.

390
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,600
Oh, boy.

391
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,280
I can't breathe.

392
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,920
Oswald.

393
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,960
They said this is their best table.

394
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,040
Interesting choice.

395
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,040
Are you sure it's not too intimate?

396
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,200
The point was to get the word out
that the Falcones support me.

397
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,560
Don't worry, people will talk.

398
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,560
I chose this place because I heard
your mother was Hungarian.

399
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,080
I thought you might
like a taste of home.

400
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,200
I can assure you, Oswald,
I'm not here to poison you.

401
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,520
Perhaps.

402
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,960
The chef likes to go heavy
on the paprika, doesn't he?

403
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,200
How is the food, otherwise?

404
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,560
Serviceable.

405
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,840
Well, I'm stuffed.

406
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,120
Thank you so much
for meeting me, Miss Falcone.

407
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,440
And thank you to your family
for their support.

408
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,760
You can't leave
until you've tried the goulash.

409
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,520
If it's anything
like the chicken paprika,

410
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,080
- I'll pass.
- It's the house specialty.

411
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,680
My mother made goulash.

412
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,400
Brought the recipe from Budapest.

413
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,040
Handed down through her family
for 300 years.

414
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,760
I doubt this will hold a candle.

415
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,960
- I'm leaving!
- Oswald?

416
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,720
Oswald?

417
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,440
It took me forever
to find his mother's recipe.

418
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,120
Did you follow it exactly?

419
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,280
I followed the recipe to a T.

420
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,440
The little man didn't like?

421
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,200
Honestly, I don't know.

422
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,880
How long have you worked here?

423
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,280
Two years, thereabouts.

424
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,320
I was in Blackgate for a time.

425
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,680
We must not have overlapped.

426
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,880
Here?

427
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,920
As a guard? As a prisoner.

428
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,440
Oh, yeah. Heard about that.

429
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,920
Is there a reason why you're not
taking us through maximum security?

430
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,840
Prisoners are in the yard
this time of day.

431
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,720
Been some changes
since you were here.

432
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,440
"McCloskey."

433
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,320
That's funny.

434
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,280
I know another J. McCloskey
who works here.

435
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,040
My cousin. Gets confusing sometimes.

436
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,720
All right, let's go.
Through this door.

437
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,400
I got to say, mate, I really love
what you've done with the old place.

438
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,320
However, I've got a question for you.

439
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,160
Yeah?

440
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:11,880
Where are the real guards?

441
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,200
Where is Bruce Wayne?

442
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,960
Ra's al Ghul has plans for the boy.

443
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,040
Where is he?

444
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,160
You'll never find him.

445
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,360
Oh, you underestimate my resolve,
pal.

446
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,360
Well, at least we know Bruce is here.

447
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,480
Well, we've walked the floor.
Where could he be?

448
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,600
There's the yard, the tower,
but they're too public.

449
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,560
There's a sub-basement,
accessible by the service elevator.

450
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,640
Which way?

451
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,160
Who did I tell you specifically
not to let in here?

452
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,280
Miss Falcone is here to see you, sir.

453
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,960
I'm sorry, Oswald.
I'm not sure what upset you, but I...

454
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,040
Enough!

455
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,160
Did you think I would really believe
this was all some coincidence?

456
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,800
That goulash tasted exactly
like my mother used to make!

457
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,800
You can't fault me
for the restaurant's authenticity.

458
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,880
You're buttering me up.

459
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,960
But for what?

460
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,800
Is it so hard to believe

461
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,240
that someone would want to do
something nice for you?

462
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,920
There was only one person
in my whole life

463
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,320
whoever did things for me
without wanting something in return.

464
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,320
And that was my mother.

465
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,360
Then I envy you.

466
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,720
My father never helped anyone
unless it benefited him.

467
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,840
And eventually it drove away
everyone who loved him.

468
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,880
Go.

469
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,440
I'll decide what to do with you
later.

470
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,160
Oswald, I only want to help you.

471
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,240
Oh, you want to help? Try leaving.

472
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,200
Your foot.

473
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,480
It's just the weather.

474
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,200
What are you doing?

475
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,520
- Don't.
- It's okay.

476
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,840
I won't judge.

477
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,640
When I was a child, I broke my ankle
while playing with my cousins.

478
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,320
I was desperate.

479
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,640
Crying in pain.

480
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,520
My father told me to put ice on it.

481
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,040
Toughen up, stop with the tears.

482
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,280
But my mother went with me
to the hospital.

483
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:24,440
And on the way, she told me that cold
actually increases the pain.

484
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,520
What's needed is warmth.

485
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,640
My mother.

486
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,040
She used to sing.

487
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,560
This may be hard for you
to understand.

488
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,320
But I have walked this earth
for centuries.

489
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,800
Waiting for you, Bruce.

490
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,840
Only you can kill me.

491
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,440
And only with that dagger.

492
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,120
That is my curse.

493
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,160
That is the meaning of my vision.

494
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,960
I don't believe you.

495
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,720
Believe me.

496
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,760
This is just another manipulation.

497
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,120
See.

498
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,880
Look.

499
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,760
My true form.

500
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,280
Every moment of my life is agony.

501
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,960
End my suffering.

502
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,720
Whatever your curse is...

503
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,440
you deserve it
for what you've done.

504
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,800
You're angry, Bruce. I understand.

505
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,960
But unless you strike me down
with that blade,

506
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,040
- you will never be free.
- No!

507
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,720
I won't.

508
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,320
Then allow me to tell you
what will happen...

509
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,720
if you don't kill me.

510
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,760
I will disappear...

511
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,320
and let you live your life.

512
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,440
You will follow the path of light.

513
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,960
Grow into a fine man.

514
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,040
Become a husband.

515
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,360
A father.

516
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:40,080
There may be a day
when you forget I ever existed.

517
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,320
But then I will return.

518
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,680
And I will kill everyone you love.

519
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,520
Just as you watched your parents die,

520
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:59,920
just as you watched me
slice your friend's throat,

521
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,080
I will slaughter your wife
and children

522
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,360
before your very eyes,

523
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:10,160
and there will be nothing
you can do about it.

524
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,520
Die.

525
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,680
Yes.

526
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:06,040
<i>Attention, all inmates.</i>

527
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,400
<i>Prison in official lockdown.</i>

528
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,080
<i>Remain in your cell.</i>

529
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,120
Are you going to arrest me?

530
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,560
For what?

531
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:23,080
For murder.

532
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,240
I don't know what I just saw
in there.

533
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,000
But as far as I'm concerned,

534
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,840
Ra's al Ghul's men broke
into Blackgate and he escaped.

535
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,680
I betrayed myself
and my parents' memory.

536
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,720
I took a life.

537
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,400
I did exactly what Ra's said I would.

538
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,800
Just because you know
you're capable of doing something

539
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,480
doesn't mean it has to happen again.

540
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,600
Bruce, you and I have known
each other a long time.

541
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,480
Since the night
your parents were murdered.

542
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,560
Now, you may not feel
like you're that kid anymore,

543
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,720
but I know that you are.

544
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,880
One who believes in doing good.

545
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,560
In fighting for what's right.

546
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,920
Who will do anything
to keep the people he loves safe.

547
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,160
Nothing that happened today
changes that.

548
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,040
What are you doing?

549
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,800
You said it yourself.

550
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,680
It's over.

551
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,320
No.

552
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,440
Can't let you do that, Master Bruce.

553
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,640
Alfred.

554
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,680
Listen, we started
this vigilante caper

555
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:45,160
to prepare for Ra's return,
didn't we?

556
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,920
But it's become
so much bigger than that.

557
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,200
I see that now. I mean,
I was wrong and you were right.

558
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,440
You can make a difference.

559
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,160
I'm not the hero Gotham needs.

560
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,880
I made that decision
the moment I killed Ra's al Ghul.

561
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,640
I took the dark path.

562
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,800
Yes, you did.

563
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,280
And it's gonna be a long,
bumpy journey back.

564
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,640
But I believe in you, Master Bruce.

565
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:22,760
I always have, and I,
I always will.

566
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,160
Now, I understand
that you don't feel worthy now.

567
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,960
But when you do, this...

568
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,960
this will be waiting for you.

569
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,840
As will I, sir.

570
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:03,800
Those guys that attacked us

571
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,760
didn't even have five bucks
between 'em.

572
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,920
We need a new plan.

573
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:14,960
What?

574
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,080
Truth.

575
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,040
Grundy friend know Grundy?

576
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,400
You deserve to know.

577
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,160
You and I...

578
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,080
were the very best of friends.

579
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,680
And then something happened to you.

580
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,920
And I just didn't recognize you.

581
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,440
But what is important
is that, with your muscles,

582
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,320
we can make money.

583
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:47,240
And with money,
we can make me smart again.

584
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,120
And then we'll figure out
what happened to you.

585
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,080
Just trust me. Okay?

586
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,640
Grundy, come on.

587
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,680
Beat him, yeah.

588
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,880
Yeah, come on!

589
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:33,520
Beat him. Come on, you big bull.
Get in there.

590
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,520
What is this, a knitting circle?
Let's see some blood!

591
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,320
Hey, I'm looking
for the person in charge here.

592
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,080
You're looking at her.

593
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,560
What do you want, squirt?

594
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:48,520
Well, if there's money to be had,
we'd like to put our hat in the ring.

595
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,520
And who are you?

596
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,200
I'm... Hey.

597
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,960
I'm this fine gentleman's manager.

598
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,040
Trust me, he's a monster.

599
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:04,960
Well, more grist for the mill.

600
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,600
We'll get you patched up.
Then we'll talk.

601
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,600
Hey.

602
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,400
Go get the doc.

603
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,400
All right, one, two, three.

604
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,800
Leave me, put it up.

605
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,720
Hey, Doc.

606
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,520
Cherry wants you to come
look at some new guy.

607
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,640
I'll be right there.
