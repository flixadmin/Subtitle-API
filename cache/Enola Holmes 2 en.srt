1
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:39,125
Stop, police!

2
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:42,166
Stop that girl!

3
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:44,541
-Excuse me!

4
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:47,500
-Terribly sorry.
-Oi!

5
00:00:47,583 --> 00:00:50,083
-Watch where you're sodding going!

6
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:53,125
Stop her!

7
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:10,541
Perhaps I should explain.

8
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,958
My name is Enola Holmes.

9
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:16,666
You may remember me.

10
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:19,333
After solving my first case…

11
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:21,583
Hello.

12
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:23,958
…I started a business.

13
00:01:25,125 --> 00:01:26,833
A detective agency.

14
00:01:28,166 --> 00:01:31,375
Open and ready for my first clients.

15
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:35,583
I was going to join the pantheon
of great Victorian detectives.

16
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:37,416
-Detective Field.
-Yes.

17
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,833
-Mackenzie Macintosh.
-Hi.

18
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:40,625
-Sir Alfred Hornblower.
-Tally-ho!

19
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:44,166
-And the infamous Reginald Swain.

20
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:47,541
And best of all,
I would be joining my brother.

21
00:01:47,625 --> 00:01:48,791
I would be his equal.

22
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:52,666
A detective in my own right,

23
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:55,666
worthy of the Holmes name.

24
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:58,458
Congratulations.

25
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,583
-Or so I thought.

26
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:11,166
Am I addressing the secretary?

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,708
You're how old?

28
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:16,375
-Stone the crows, you're young.
-My age is an advantage.

29
00:02:16,458 --> 00:02:20,208
I can go to places others can't,
explore where others won't.

30
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:22,375
And I can fight. I know jujitsu.

31
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:28,125
But you're a girl.

32
00:02:28,208 --> 00:02:30,000
Yes, I am. Um…

33
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:32,208
What experience have you had?

34
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:38,000
-The Tewkesbury case?
-Well, that was Sherlock Holmes.

35
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:39,166
-That was Sherlock--
-Sherlock--

36
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:43,083
-Sherlock Holmes, wasn't it?
-I assure you, it was mine.

37
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:46,083
Good man, that Tewkesbury. Brave lad.

38
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,125
-Tell me--

39
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,125
-Tell me--
-Yes?

40
00:02:50,083 --> 00:02:51,375
Might your brother be free?

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,833
Read all about it! Read all about it!

42
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:59,708
Sherlock Holmes
and the case of the Brixton corpse.

43
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:01,208
So, my brother.

44
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:05,875
While I had not a single case,
Sherlock has been drowning in them.

45
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:10,875
Though his latest
appears to be vexing him.

46
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:15,916
My mother, meanwhile, is still on the run.

47
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:20,208
And trying not to draw
attention to herself.

48
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,916
Though that's never
been her forte.

49
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:45,666
Yes, and then there is… him.

50
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,291
My lords,
reform is not a task to be accomplished,

51
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:50,958
nor a bill that can be passed.

52
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,083
Rather it is a constant need for change.

53
00:03:56,583 --> 00:04:01,250
Lord Tewkesbury,
the champion of change and progress.

54
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,375
A man to approach with the noblest cause.

55
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:10,458
♪ Till we have built Jerusalem ♪

56
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:19,041
But I had no time
for distractions.

57
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,416
And besides, he's still a nincompoop.

58
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:25,833
Too many people
make it their sole purpose in life

59
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:28,250
to fit into the world around them.

60
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,666
This is a mistake.

61
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:33,750
It's your path, Enola.

62
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,333
Sometimes, you'll stumble.

63
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,916
Sometimes, you'll fall.

64
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,708
But no matter how lost you feel,

65
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,166
if you stay true to yourself,

66
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:47,708
the path will always find you again.

67
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,708
But my path, it seemed,
had come to an end.

68
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,208
I was a failure.

69
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,250
All I could do now was go home.

70
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,750
Enola Holmes?

71
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:28,208
Yes?

72
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:30,416
I've come to the right place then.

73
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:34,500
Is it true you find lost people?

74
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:39,083
Where did you get this?

75
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,708
It's months old.

76
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,583
I found it on the street.

77
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:45,916
Who have you lost?

78
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:49,583
My sister.

79
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:05,458
Watch the gap.

80
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,500
She disappeared a week ago.

81
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,083
Everyone says she's run away,
but Sarah wouldn't do that,

82
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,000
not to me.

83
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,750
She's my only family now.

84
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:28,041
This way.

85
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:33,500
The other girls are still at work.

86
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,583
Tea?

87
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:39,750
Thank you.

88
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:42,875
Might I see her bedroom?

89
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,625
Ours, you mean?

90
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,291
You're standing in it.

91
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:53,125
We're lucky.
Most girls here are five to a room.

92
00:06:58,875 --> 00:06:59,791
This might help.

93
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,458
Oh. Sarah likes
to leave cheese out for 'em.

94
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,083
She's soft.

95
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,750
What does she look like, Sarah?

96
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:16,458
About this tall.

97
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,291
Pretty.

98
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:19,500
Very pretty.

99
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:22,541
Green eyes, red hair, freckles--

100
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:23,875
Red hair?

101
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:26,666
We weren't sisters in the usual way.

102
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,208
Found sisters.

103
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,000
Sarah took her in.

104
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,291
Who's this, Bess?

105
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:35,208
-Enola Holmes.
-She's a detective.

106
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:37,291
She looks like
she'll blow over in the wind.

107
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:38,250
Mae!

108
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:45,416
So, Bessie, what was Sarah wearing
the day she disappeared?

109
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,208
-What's she doing?
-Shh.

110
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,083
She's wasting her time.

111
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,250
It was her other dress, the green one.

112
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,458
Does she like reading?

113
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,583
Oh yes. She taught herself.

114
00:08:00,208 --> 00:08:03,375
Sarah said you had to learn about
the world if you're gonna live in it.

115
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,625
Makeup.

116
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:12,250
Did she have a suitor?

117
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:15,208
Nah. But there's plenty
have taken an interest.

118
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:19,916
She weren't much of a gardener.

119
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:25,958
Look, how about you quit sniffing round?

120
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,250
Quiet, Mae!
Just let her do her job.

121
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:47,208
The 12th of March.
Does that date mean anything to you?

122
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:48,291
That's enough.

123
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,833
We don't need help from people like you.

124
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,708
I found her, so she's staying.

125
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,833
-Bloody girls poking their nose in.

126
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,916
-And she didn't leave a note?
-Just this.

127
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,916
She worked two jobs, you see.
We couldn't get by without it.

128
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,708
Washed glasses at a pub.

129
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:15,333
Some place called The Stag Antlers.

130
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,375
You can have it.

131
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:22,416
Oh. No, it's all right.
We'll figure that out later.

132
00:09:23,291 --> 00:09:25,916
So tell me,
when was the last time you saw her?

133
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,208
A week ago, at the match factory.

134
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:32,916
She had a fight with Mr. Crouch,
the foreman, in his office.

135
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,208
-What about?
-He said she was thieving.

136
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:36,916
But Sarah's honest.

137
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,958
The match factory,
is that where she works?

138
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:43,291
Where we all work.
We're match girls, ain't we?

139
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,416
-Then that's where we'll start.
-So you'll take it? You'll take the case?

140
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:54,875
Thank you, Miss Holmes.

141
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:56,250
Thank you.

142
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,333
At last, my first case.

143
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:01,791
Well, actually, my second.

144
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,208
I shall find you, Sarah Chapman.

145
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:08,375
Red hair, green dress,
makeup, science books, 12th March.

146
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:09,833
Whatever you've been up to…

147
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:13,625
…the game is afoot.

148
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,916
Stay with me. Follow my way.

149
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:23,083
-How many girls work here?
-Five hundred, maybe six.

150
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:25,583
How do I look?

151
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,791
-Is my neckerchief all right?
-Oh, well, it's around your neck.

152
00:10:29,833 --> 00:10:30,833
Morning, Bessie.

153
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:31,833
Morning, Doris.

154
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,458
Mouth.

155
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:41,500
Mouth.

156
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,250
-Mouth.
-Come on.

157
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,666
-Next.
-Out.

158
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,791
-Please, Mr. Crouch.
-I said, out.

159
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,833
-Mouth.
-What are you looking at?

160
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:55,166
Oi, new girl.
Name in the register.

161
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,833
Mouth.

162
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,916
-What are you looking for?
-Typhus.

163
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,541
That's the phosphorus.

164
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:19,666
Don't worry, you get used to the smell.

165
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:31,458
Is this where she worked?

166
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,875
Put the matches on the comb…

167
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,250
slide 'em along,

168
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:39,541
up and into the box.

169
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,083
Simple enough.

170
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:45,416
-You try.

171
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,333
That is a penny off your wages.

172
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:04,250
She's just learning the way,
Mr. Crouch.

173
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:07,166
She better learn quicker,
or it's a penny off yours too.

174
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,833
Anyone else want a money dock?

175
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:11,833
How about you, eh?

176
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,083
No, didn't think so.

177
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:18,458
Right, back to work.

178
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:27,041
I need to get up into that office.

179
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:28,958
Not a hope.

180
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:43,875
No talking.

181
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:48,083
All it takes is one small thing

182
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,583
to change the rules of the world.

183
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,291
Oi. Faster fingers, faster fingers.

184
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,875
Hurrah!

185
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,250
How did that bloody happen, eh?

186
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:23,750
Well, pick 'em up.

187
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:25,541
Oi, pick 'em up.

188
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,416
Pick 'em up, pick 'em up.

189
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,916
Right! Back to work.

190
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,083
Why were you here?

191
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,333
Come on, girls.

192
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,958
Red.

193
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,333
Time's a-wasting.

194
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,333
Don't you look at me like that, girl.

195
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,958
-Oi, stop talking!

196
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:18,000
-Green eyes, red hair.

197
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,708
So you did steal something.

198
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:30,041
Charles! This is not what I was
expecting when we made our arrangement.

199
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,875
This is blatant extortion.

200
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:32,916
Criminal!

201
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:36,250
-My pockets are empty.
-You think mine full?

202
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,458
You gave me your word you'd find
whoever was doing this to us.

203
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,541
You sound almost threatening, Mr. Lyon.

204
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:45,791
This is not what I expected
when we began our arrangement.

205
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,125
And now theft, on top of everything else.

206
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:52,708
-You heard the man. Get this dealt with.
-Come along, William.

207
00:14:56,916 --> 00:15:00,375
Sir, do you have any suspicions
as to who this perpetrator might be?

208
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,541
Would I be asking you if I did?

209
00:15:05,541 --> 00:15:09,750
But, sir, perhaps if we were to consider
whether this theft is connected.

210
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,416
-I have ideas--
-Did I ask for your advice?

211
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,125
Or did I simply tell you to get it done?

212
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,000
I'll make sure the right people know, sir.

213
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,333
Miss Troy!

214
00:15:25,833 --> 00:15:26,875
Yes, sir.

215
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,500
Our ladies are working at the highest
level of production and efficiency.

216
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,208
-Are they not, William?
-Yes, Father.

217
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:37,666
-Please, if you will…

218
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:41,333
Doris, how are you? How's your sister?
Is she, um, still unwell?

219
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:43,000
Uh, yes, Mr. Lyon.

220
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:44,625
Typhus.

221
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,750
Really is the plague of our time.

222
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:51,333
Two years it's been killing these girls.

223
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:52,458
Breaks my heart.

224
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:59,250
Well, Lord McIntyre, if I might suggest
a little lunch. I think we've earned it.

225
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:06,500
How did Sarah do it?
Get into the office?

226
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:10,291
There was a fire at one of the stations.
Foreman got distracted.

227
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:13,583
Whose station?

228
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:15,250
Mae's?

229
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:16,791
Yes.

230
00:16:18,041 --> 00:16:20,333
You're a good detective, Enola Holmes.

231
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,791
Everyone thinks detecting
is a profession littered with rules,

232
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,125
but in truth, there's only one.

233
00:16:35,208 --> 00:16:38,916
Pull on every loose thread you find.

234
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:42,958
She's a loose thread.

235
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,583
So I'm pulling at her.

236
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:54,958
-Oh.
-Hello, sir.

237
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,833
-What a pleasant evening.
-Young lady, I'm afraid I'm married.

238
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:21,708
Hello, dearie. Forgot your ticket?

239
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:25,250
That's tuppence for a sweet,
cheating face like yours.

240
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:26,916
Ha'penny a piece.

241
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,375
-Genuine toffee.
-Out of my way, girl.

242
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:31,791
Ha'penny a piece.

243
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,333
Where are you, Mae?

244
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,250
Excuse me, sir.

245
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:39,958
I've never seen anything like it!

246
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:47,583
And here she comes!

247
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,875
One, two,
a-one, two, three four.

Mr. Li and his world of illusions!

Um, no. I'm looking for a girl called M--

262
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,125
Uh…

263
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:11,958
Hm.

264
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:23,875
She worked two jobs, you see.

265
00:19:24,875 --> 00:19:26,875
Some place called The Stag Antlers.

268

Did Sarah work here?

269
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:47,250
She did, didn't she?
And Bessie doesn't know.

270
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,708
There's plenty Bessie don't know.
And plenty you don't need to tell her.

271
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:54,625
I know you helped her into that office.
She took those pages. Why?

272
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,416
-What's happened to her?
-Just leave us be, all right?

273
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,083
Posh girls like you
don't belong in this fight.

274
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,916
Posh or not,
one thing I am good at is fighting.

275
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,458
Now tell me, where is she hiding
and what does she know?

276
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,875
You got more to you than I thought.

277
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:17,583
Whatever this is,
Mae is on stage in 30 ticks,

278
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,416
and she's still dressed as a gent.

279
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,708
So let go of her, now.

280
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:28,041
-Get her out of here.
-Be my pleasure.

281
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,708
Come on.

282
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,916
Where did Sarah Chapman do her makeup?

283
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:44,000
Full of secrets that one,
and not a bad actress.

284
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,291
I'd have given her the boot
if she weren't so good,

285
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,625
but she did attract the men
with big pockets.

286
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,250
Always useful that. Shift it.

287
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,041
Which men?

288
00:20:57,541 --> 00:21:01,083
There was this one gent, society type,
and he came regular.

289
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:06,500
Very keen on him she was.
He'd send flowers, letters.

290
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:12,916
His name?

291
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:17,583
Never gave one.

292
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:22,541
You see, they all think there's
hope. That love is coming their way.

293
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,000
But it never is.

294
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,250
Blokes like that, they want cheap,

295
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,375
but they marry dear.

296
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,500
"As we two ate of the fruit of love…"

297
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:38,083
The fruit of love? Ugh.

298
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,666
"A bell did ring in the sky above"

299
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,750
"So wander that place
With its blossoms white"

300
00:21:43,833 --> 00:21:45,833
"A chapel awaits us out of sight"

301
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:48,791
And a poppy.

302
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,458
Is that his name?

303
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:53,958
Why did she leave?

304
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,833
Did she run away with this fellow?

305
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,875
Or is she running from him?

306
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:10,916
I hope it's the latter.
His poetry is extremely bad.

307
00:23:00,958 --> 00:23:02,541
Be away with you, boy.

308
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:03,916
All right.

309
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:10,250
-Sherlock?
-Enola.

310
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:13,625
What are you doing here? It's not safe.

311
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:15,333
There are scary people about.

312
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:19,083
-Yes, let me know when you meet one.

313
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:22,208
-Brother, are you quite yourself?
-I'm fine.

314
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:25,833
It was just a disagreement
over a glass of wine

315
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:27,583
and whose wine it was.

316
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:28,541
And, uh…

317
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:33,833
I find after wine, it's very difficult
to make your arms and legs move.

318
00:23:33,916 --> 00:23:34,875
Let's get you home.

319
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:40,000
I don't usually imbibe,
but I'm on a case, you see.

320
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:42,708
-It's proven rather tricky.
-Cab.

321
00:23:42,791 --> 00:23:44,208
-Hello.
-Hello.

322
00:23:44,708 --> 00:23:47,166
-Where are we going?
-221 Baker Street.

323
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:56,416
As it turns out,
my brother is medievally heavy.

324
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:01,250
It's like carrying a dead horse
on which sits another dead horse.

325
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,916
That's A, and I'm B.

326
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,916
I didn't know you had steps.

327
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,500
One should always have steps
to avoid people stepping on you.

328
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:17,708
That's a tip.
You should probably write that down.

329
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:20,541
All right. Lift your right leg.

330
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:22,166
Mm-hmm.

331
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:24,708
Now your left.

332
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:28,833
Better leg, the left.
You should write that down.

333
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:36,875
Ha! Home. Well done, Sherlock.

334
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:40,125
I can do it.

335
00:24:43,666 --> 00:24:44,500
See?

336
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:51,416
Baker Street.

337
00:24:58,458 --> 00:25:02,541
-Oh, but it's such a mess.
-It's perfect. Don't touch anything.

338
00:25:02,625 --> 00:25:04,458
What are you investigating?

339
00:25:04,541 --> 00:25:06,875
None of your business.
I work alone. It's private.

340
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:09,291
Now shh, I'm thinking.

341
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:11,875
One should never be interrupted
when thinking.

342
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:15,125
-Oh. You should--
-Write that down?

343
00:25:17,458 --> 00:25:19,041
-Shh!

344
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,166
Don't go in there.

345
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:24,333
No.

346
00:25:38,375 --> 00:25:40,000
Sherlock's latest case.

347
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:49,458
Fascinating.

348
00:25:52,291 --> 00:25:56,000
And why, pray, have you moved everything?

349
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:03,833
-Nothing looks different to me.
-Nothing looks different? Ev--

350
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,125
Your head is sore? I can't think why.

351
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:09,916
This is why
I don't have people in my rooms.

352
00:26:10,708 --> 00:26:14,250
Look what you've done.
My papers are entirely out of order.

353
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,583
Your case, it's vexing you.

354
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:21,708
Seems to be an awful lot of question marks
on that map of yours.

355
00:26:21,791 --> 00:26:23,708
Dundee cake. Door.

356
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:26,125
-I will see you again.
-Is that why you're drinking?

357
00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:29,041
I'm more than certain…
…it's not so old.

358
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:31,416
-Maybe I can help.
-You can help by leaving.

359
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:35,958
Huh. Yes. The world
will be a much safer place

360
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:39,208
if we don't see the inside
of Sherlock Holmes, only the out.

361
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:42,083
Crazy idea.

362
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:45,208
Have you ever considered a flatmate?

363
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:48,041
-For what purpose?
-To stop you descending into this.

364
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:53,250
Strange

365
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:58,250
how those seeking advice
so often like to dispense it.

366
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:01,041
Did I ask for advice?
I found you on the street, drunk.

367
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:04,333
-Now what may I observe about you?
-We're not playing this game.

368
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:05,916
Shoes a state. Hair's not much better.

369
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
-You and Mycroft are so similar.
-You need to wash your clothes.

370
00:27:09,125 --> 00:27:11,208
-Unwilling to look past--
-You are pale--

371
00:27:11,291 --> 00:27:14,208
-Stop!
-And then there's your fingernails.

372
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:17,666
-Why are you working in a match factory?
-What?

373
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:21,416
Last night, they were dirty with green
traces. This morning, they are black.

374
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,041
The phosphorous from the match-making
has mixed with oxygen.

375
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:27,041
I wasn't in such a state
as to not see that.

376
00:27:27,666 --> 00:27:29,583
-How did you--
-And your neck is red.

377
00:27:29,666 --> 00:27:31,541
Someone has gripped it
or held a knife against…

378
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,083
Are you involved in something dangerous?

379
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:41,250
You are still my ward.

380
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:44,041
If you need my help,
my offer remains on the table.

381
00:27:45,583 --> 00:27:48,125
Don't be so desperate
to prove yourself, Enola.

382
00:27:49,666 --> 00:27:54,083
I am not desperate,
and I don't need your or anyone's help.

383
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,625
But this I will have.

384
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:11,041
How dare he?
How dare he lecture me?

385
00:28:11,708 --> 00:28:13,416
When he can't even solve his own case

386
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,666
and he lives in a bed of flummoxing papers
and bewildering mold.

387
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:19,375
How dare he claim I'm desperate?
It is not true.

388
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:21,750
-And this is not fair.
-Enola?

389
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,500
It is you.

390
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:30,208
And it is you.

391
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:33,041
How are you?

392
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,333
Are you well? You look…

393
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:40,708
I'm on a case. Undercover. Forget
I told you that piece of information.

394
00:28:40,791 --> 00:28:44,625
It's the strangest thing. I could have
sworn I've seen you here before.

395
00:28:46,166 --> 00:28:47,125
Is that right?

396
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:50,250
Well, this is my…
My route through to the Lords.

397
00:28:50,916 --> 00:28:53,458
Is it? How lovely.

398
00:28:53,541 --> 00:28:56,083
Well, I… I breakfast here on occasion.

399
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:03,750
I mean, yes, it's a lovely place.
I-I know the gardener here.

400
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:07,000
We've been discussing
what to sow for next year's crop.

401
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:08,416
Some fine sunflowers.

402
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,375
Uh, Sweet Williams,
for their lovely vivid reds.

403
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,000
I've seen all you're doing.

404
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:16,625
Oh. Well, it's… It's nothing.

405
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:18,041
In the society pages.

406
00:29:21,791 --> 00:29:23,625
You are quite the eligible bachelor.

407
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,125
Don't believe all you read.

408
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:34,250
I wrote to you.

409
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:37,250
You didn't reply.

410
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:38,708
Uh…

411
00:29:39,666 --> 00:29:41,583
I… was busy.

412
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:44,625
Starting my own business.
A perpetual challenge.

413
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:46,833
Perhaps, not something you'd understand.

414
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:50,041
-Well, Enola, if you need help--
-I do not.

415
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:54,583
Should my problem become horticultural,
I shall seek you out.

416
00:29:56,166 --> 00:29:57,000
Right.

417
00:29:57,583 --> 00:30:00,250
Well, you know where to find me

418
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:03,500
should a plant go missing.

419
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:05,583
I hope you enjoy your breakfast.

420
00:30:09,916 --> 00:30:10,750
Yeah.

421
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,500
Is he looking back?

422
00:30:20,583 --> 00:30:22,458
Oh. Good, he isn't.

423
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,250
I don't come here every day.

424
00:30:27,166 --> 00:30:28,791
Just on days when I feel a need.

425
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:33,833
And sometimes he doesn't take this path.
Sometimes he takes the parallel one.

426
00:30:36,916 --> 00:30:41,125
-You know where to find me.

427
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,500
"You know where to find me."

428
00:30:48,583 --> 00:30:50,125
"Out of sight"

429
00:30:50,208 --> 00:30:53,583
"The chapel awaits us
With its blossoms white"

430
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:55,041
Whitechapel.

431
00:30:55,916 --> 00:30:57,666
"As we two ate of the fruit of love"

432
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,541
"As we two ate…"

433
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,916
"Two ate." Two-eight.

434
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:02,958
Twenty-eight.

435
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:06,458
"A bell did ring in the sky above"

436
00:31:06,541 --> 00:31:07,625
Bell?

437
00:31:07,708 --> 00:31:08,875
"So wander that place"

438
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:12,166
Bell. Place. "Out of sight"

439
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:17,083
28 Bell Place, Whitechapel!

440
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,333
Shh!

441
00:31:18,416 --> 00:31:20,041
-Oh, sorry.

442
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,708
The game has found its feet again.

443
00:31:28,875 --> 00:31:30,125
I will not lie.

444
00:31:30,208 --> 00:31:33,041
There is a certain satisfaction
that you feel as a detective

445
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:35,750
when your case comes closer to resolution.

446
00:31:35,833 --> 00:31:36,958
Like sewing a new skirt…

447
00:31:39,541 --> 00:31:42,416
…which I don't do,
or teaching a dog to sit.

448
00:31:43,416 --> 00:31:46,500
You begin to glow with the acknowledgement
of a job well done.

449
00:31:46,583 --> 00:31:48,500
There's a new Holmes in town.

450
00:31:48,583 --> 00:31:51,500
That's right. Sherlock Holmes
has met his match.

451
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:55,541
My name will be known,
and Bessie will have a sister once again.

452
00:31:56,541 --> 00:31:58,083
And that is a job well…

453
00:32:00,791 --> 00:32:01,625
done.

454
00:32:26,208 --> 00:32:27,291
Sarah?

455
00:32:42,958 --> 00:32:44,541
What happened here?

456
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:56,333
Mr. Poppy.

457
00:33:06,958 --> 00:33:08,916
-Oh, Mae.

458
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:13,791
What happened? Who did this to you?

459
00:33:13,875 --> 00:33:17,750
-Was it him, Sarah's man? Mae!

460
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,708
No, no. It's all right.

461
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:22,500
I'll fetch a doctor for you.

462
00:33:23,916 --> 00:33:25,541
No! No, no, no.

463
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:26,958
No.

464
00:33:27,625 --> 00:33:28,458
Come back.

465
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:05,958
Miss Holmes?

466
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,750
-Inspector Lestrade.

467
00:34:09,833 --> 00:34:11,666
-Enola Holmes.
-Lestrade.

468
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,416
-She… She's--
-Dead.

469
00:34:14,958 --> 00:34:15,875
How'd that happen?

470
00:34:20,583 --> 00:34:24,333
Oh, no, no, no. I'm investigating a case.
A disappearance of a girl.

471
00:34:24,416 --> 00:34:27,458
-What, that girl?
-No. No, no, no. H-Her name is Mae.

472
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
She worked at the Paragon Theater,
the matchstick factory.

473
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:34,458
-She was a dancer. She's friends--

474
00:34:48,791 --> 00:34:50,041
Superintendent Grail.

475
00:34:55,541 --> 00:34:57,958
-Good morning.
-Good morning, sir.

476
00:34:58,041 --> 00:35:00,541
I was sent to investigate
a possible disturbance.

477
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:03,791
Someone heard some screams,
and then I discovered this young lady.

478
00:35:03,875 --> 00:35:04,916
Her name?

479
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,291
Enola Holmes.

480
00:35:07,833 --> 00:35:08,958
Uh, his sister.

481
00:35:09,666 --> 00:35:10,708
A detective too.

482
00:35:10,791 --> 00:35:13,875
Good God, another one.

483
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:15,916
Shouldn't you be in finishing school?

484
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:19,500
Investigating the disappearance of a…

485
00:35:19,583 --> 00:35:20,833
-Sarah Chapman.
-Yeah.

486
00:35:20,916 --> 00:35:24,458
Sarah Chapman?
Well, well, how intriguing. So am I.

487
00:35:24,541 --> 00:35:27,625
-She's wanted for theft and blackmail.
-Blackmail?

488
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:29,375
Yes, detective.

489
00:35:31,583 --> 00:35:33,958
Still warm. No rigor mortis.

490
00:35:34,583 --> 00:35:37,666
-When were the screams heard, inspector?
-Ten past the hour, sir.

491
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:40,625
When did you arrive, detective?

492
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:42,333
A-Around the same time.

493
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:46,875
Even more intriguing.

494
00:35:46,958 --> 00:35:51,333
Uh, no, I was trying to suppress
the blood. I-I was trying to save her.

495
00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:53,666
Or trying to get information out of her.

496
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:56,875
Give her a search, inspector.

497
00:35:56,958 --> 00:35:59,666
Oh, I couldn't. I can't pat her down, sir.

498
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:03,625
Come along, Lestrade.
Let's not be coy about this.

499
00:36:03,708 --> 00:36:06,750
-She's a detective. She knows the rules.
-Yes.

500
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:11,125
Um…

501
00:36:11,208 --> 00:36:12,416
Give me that bag!

502
00:36:21,666 --> 00:36:22,500
What's this?

503
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:24,750
My evidence.

504
00:36:26,291 --> 00:36:27,208
And that?

505
00:36:30,041 --> 00:36:31,208
It's nothing.

506
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:32,750
Then why are you hiding it?

507
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:37,041
Found at a murder scene
with a freshly dead corpse,

508
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:39,583
harboring evidence isn't gonna look good.

509
00:36:39,666 --> 00:36:41,875
Superintendent Grail, you can't believe--

510
00:36:41,958 --> 00:36:44,333
What can't I believe, missy?

511
00:36:44,875 --> 00:36:47,625
That young ladies
don't have the hands for killing?

512
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:48,750
Now, give them here.

513
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:55,541
-Oh!

514
00:37:05,916 --> 00:37:08,125
-Go on!
-After her, all of ya!

515
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,375
Why ever would she ever do that?

516
00:37:11,875 --> 00:37:14,708
-Get out of the way! Move!

517
00:37:14,791 --> 00:37:16,708
-Stop that girl!

518
00:37:19,416 --> 00:37:20,625
You've seen this before.

519
00:37:25,041 --> 00:37:28,416
Ah. Lestrade of Scotland Yard.
You remember me, I hope.

520
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,958
We're looking for your sister.
She's caused a bit of trouble.

521
00:37:45,458 --> 00:37:46,416
May I?

522
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,083
Is it, sir?

523
00:37:58,708 --> 00:37:59,875
Is it?

524
00:37:59,958 --> 00:38:02,125
Take it. I have others.

525
00:38:02,208 --> 00:38:03,958
Take it? I can't.

526
00:38:04,041 --> 00:38:05,083
I can.

527
00:38:05,166 --> 00:38:06,000
I can't.

528
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,000
Perhaps I can.

529
00:38:15,541 --> 00:38:17,750
And this, the famous fiddle?

530
00:38:19,375 --> 00:38:21,291
That I do not have two of.

531
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:25,416
Perhaps you can explain
what you believe Enola has done.

532
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,416
I wish I was at liberty to say, sir.

533
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,083
Do you mind?

534
00:38:41,041 --> 00:38:43,041
Oh, your latest case.

535
00:38:43,541 --> 00:38:45,041
What's it concerning?

536
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,708
Is it another Brixton Strangler?

537
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:49,375
Or a Periwinkle?

538
00:38:50,791 --> 00:38:52,458
Don't tell me it's a Clerkenwell.

539
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:54,416
What evidence do they have
against my sister?

540
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,166
Perhaps, uh, you tell me yours
and I'll tell you mine.

541
00:39:01,041 --> 00:39:02,750
Government case, some missing money.

542
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:04,958
Now you.

543
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,416
Super wants to talk her.

544
00:39:08,208 --> 00:39:10,500
-Why?
-Just following orders, Mr. Holmes.

545
00:39:10,583 --> 00:39:12,166
Or may I call you Sherlock?

546
00:39:14,416 --> 00:39:17,000
Graydon. Graydon Lestrade.

547
00:39:17,083 --> 00:39:20,791
My father thought it distinguished,
and it is rather.

548
00:39:25,416 --> 00:39:28,708
Well, anyway, should you ever
wish to call me that…

549
00:39:30,208 --> 00:39:31,041
Right.

550
00:39:34,083 --> 00:39:34,958
As you were.

551
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:47,041
Oh dear.

552
00:39:49,083 --> 00:39:50,875
Whoa!

553
00:39:51,666 --> 00:39:54,333
My mistake.
I should have warned you I was opening it.

554
00:39:57,416 --> 00:39:58,250
No.

555
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,916
Dare I ask?

556
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:12,875
Good afternoon.

557
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:15,208
May I ask a favor?

558
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:23,333
Never mind. Tell me everything.

559
00:40:24,166 --> 00:40:25,708
-A government case?
-No.

560
00:40:26,916 --> 00:40:28,916
Is it
another Brixton Strangler?

561
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:32,125
Or… Or a Periwinkle?

562
00:40:32,708 --> 00:40:34,875
"You tell me yours
and I'll tell you mine."

563
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:38,500
He's a ninny. I needed to know
what he had on you.

564
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:46,083
Money. Unaccounted transfers
going in and out of government offices.

565
00:40:46,833 --> 00:40:49,458
My theory is either bribery,
extortion, or blackmail.

566
00:40:49,541 --> 00:40:50,875
And what have you found?

567
00:40:52,666 --> 00:40:54,750
Separate filings
from five different accounts

568
00:40:54,833 --> 00:40:58,041
going via the Treasury
into one private bank.

569
00:40:58,125 --> 00:41:00,791
-So someone is getting rich from this?
-Yes.

570
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:04,041
-Who?
-No name.

571
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:05,541
Just a number.

572
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:08,583
I visited the bank and inquired.
The money disappeared,

573
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,833
arriving at another bank,
and then another,

574
00:41:10,916 --> 00:41:13,083
and another, and another,
and another, and another.

575
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:16,833
Every one of them hidden
using different account numbers.

576
00:41:16,916 --> 00:41:18,083
Twenty-seven in total.

577
00:41:18,166 --> 00:41:21,583
-Well, what can you deduce from that?
-Three things.

578
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:25,916
Firstly, the man's a game player,
perhaps a genius in mathematics,

579
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,083
capable of covering his traces
at every turn.

580
00:41:28,166 --> 00:41:30,541
Secondly, the sources are varied.

581
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:33,958
Five banks, south of the river,
but no clear link between them.

582
00:41:34,541 --> 00:41:35,875
All anonymous.

583
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:39,125
All going into one pocket.

584
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:41,541
And the third?

585
00:41:44,791 --> 00:41:45,875
He knows I'm onto him.

586
00:41:47,416 --> 00:41:48,250
What? How?

587
00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:51,833
Every time I pull a thread,
it loosens, vanishes,

588
00:41:51,916 --> 00:41:54,625
reappears somewhere else.
He's leading me a merry dance.

589
00:41:54,708 --> 00:41:55,541
It's…

590
00:41:57,958 --> 00:41:58,916
It's infuriating.

591
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:02,083
So no leads whatsoever?

592
00:42:02,666 --> 00:42:04,416
One. A week before the first transfer,

593
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,166
there was a break-in
at the Treasury office

594
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,708
by a man in a taper crown hat.

595
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:08,916
A taper crown hat.

596
00:42:09,583 --> 00:42:10,875
-What was taken?
-A document.

597
00:42:10,958 --> 00:42:13,666
They won't talk about it.
Sensitive information presumably.

598
00:42:14,166 --> 00:42:18,000
But how it connects to all of this
has so far eluded me.

599
00:42:18,541 --> 00:42:21,000
Your turn. I hope the blood's not yours.

600
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:24,500
I'm looking for a girl, Sarah Chapman.

601
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:27,041
Her sister employed me. Bessie.

602
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:31,458
She worked at Lyons match factory by day,
and the music hall at night.

603
00:42:32,375 --> 00:42:33,250
She has a lover,

604
00:42:34,541 --> 00:42:36,291
whose flat I visited.

605
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:39,041
He'd given her this.

606
00:42:42,458 --> 00:42:43,666
28 Bell Place?

607
00:42:45,083 --> 00:42:46,458
Whitechapel, yes.

608
00:42:46,541 --> 00:42:48,791
And there I found her friend,

609
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:50,916
murdered.

610
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:57,541
And who killed her? This poppy fellow?

611
00:43:01,666 --> 00:43:03,041
I suspect so.

612
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:05,791
Perhaps he kidnapped Sarah
and her friend discovered it.

613
00:43:06,291 --> 00:43:08,041
Love.

614
00:43:09,041 --> 00:43:10,250
What it does to people.

615
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:14,333
-How was she killed?
-A kitchen knife.

616
00:43:14,416 --> 00:43:15,875
-Did you touch this weapon?
-No.

617
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:18,833
Then why did you run?

618
00:43:18,916 --> 00:43:20,500
I found more evidence on her.

619
00:43:20,583 --> 00:43:22,416
This policeman wanted it.

620
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,333
-He has this walk.
-Grail.

621
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:27,250
We have a history.

622
00:43:28,875 --> 00:43:30,375
This was in her pocket.

623
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:52,250
It's as bad as the poem.

624
00:43:54,041 --> 00:43:55,625
-Leave it with me.
-No.

625
00:43:56,125 --> 00:43:58,333
It's mine, and it's important.

626
00:43:59,666 --> 00:44:03,041
Grail said she had stolen something
and that she was blackmailing them.

627
00:44:03,666 --> 00:44:06,916
-Though Sarah wouldn't do that.
-You don't know this person.

628
00:44:08,083 --> 00:44:08,916
I feel I do.

629
00:44:09,916 --> 00:44:11,958
You came here running from the police.

630
00:44:12,041 --> 00:44:13,791
Someone is already dead,

631
00:44:13,875 --> 00:44:16,125
and you are now a suspect
in a murder case.

632
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:18,166
You've let your emotions
get the better of you.

633
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:21,583
Stay here. Don't leave.
I will look into this.

634
00:44:21,666 --> 00:44:25,541
But Sarah Chapman is my responsibility.
No one else cares for these girls.

635
00:44:26,125 --> 00:44:27,666
I promised her sister.

636
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:29,541
The first mistake a detective makes

637
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:33,250
is to make it about themselves
and not the case.

638
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:43,416
Enola, I know you're not a fan
of unnecessary advice,

639
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,875
but please…

640
00:44:48,083 --> 00:44:49,125
…don't turn into me.

641
00:44:53,875 --> 00:44:55,583
I should probably write that down.

642
00:44:56,916 --> 00:44:59,750
Matches, matches!
Come buy your matches!

643
00:44:59,833 --> 00:45:01,083
Only a penny a box.

644
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:05,375
Matches, matches! Only a penny a box.

645
00:45:05,458 --> 00:45:06,916
Come buy your matches!

646
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,041
Posh girls like you
don't belong in this fight.

647
00:45:09,125 --> 00:45:11,125
We don't need help from people like you.

648
00:45:13,208 --> 00:45:17,791
See, they all think there's hope.
That love is coming their way.

649
00:45:17,875 --> 00:45:19,125
But it never is.

650
00:45:20,291 --> 00:45:22,375
Gents like that, they want cheap,

651
00:45:22,458 --> 00:45:23,958
but they marry dear.

652
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,583
So, Poppy, you're a gent, are you?

653
00:45:30,166 --> 00:45:33,333
And a well-heeled one
to afford a love nest like that.

654
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:37,500
-Sir--
-Don't be ridiculous.

655
00:46:23,333 --> 00:46:26,291
There was a break-in
at the Treasury office

656
00:46:26,375 --> 00:46:27,875
by a man in a taper crown hat.

657
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:36,625
Five banks, south of the river,
but no clear link between them.

658
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,750
"Match makers ball."

659
00:46:44,583 --> 00:46:48,625
"Hosted by Henry and Hilda Lyon.
12 Marchmont Square."

660
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:51,958
Does that date mean anything to you?

661
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:55,583
It's not a date at all.

662
00:46:57,958 --> 00:47:01,166
"Their eldest son, William Lyon,
will be leading the first…"

663
00:47:02,125 --> 00:47:04,541
Sweet Williams,
for their wonderfully vivid reds.

664
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:08,375
Our ladies are working at the highest
level of production and efficiency.

665
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:10,250
-Are they not, William?
-Yes, Father.

666
00:47:10,333 --> 00:47:13,833
And all along, I thought you were a poppy.

667
00:47:16,541 --> 00:47:19,666
Let's see how sweet you are,
Sweet William.

668
00:47:22,916 --> 00:47:23,916
I'm going to a ball.

669
00:47:26,958 --> 00:47:27,833
Ugh.

670
00:47:49,291 --> 00:47:50,125
'Tis I.

671
00:47:51,958 --> 00:47:53,250
'Tis not I.

672
00:47:54,083 --> 00:47:56,833
Which, when you're wanted
by the police, is most useful.

673
00:47:57,458 --> 00:48:00,875
Pray silence
for his Lordship Viscount McIntyre.

674
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:03,541
I-I'm sorry to break apart
this glorious occasion,

675
00:48:03,625 --> 00:48:05,250
but, well, I'm a politician.

676
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:08,291
Any chance to stand on a stage,
I'll always take it.

677
00:48:09,458 --> 00:48:12,916
And I must speak
to thank our host

678
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,958
and applaud his achievements.

679
00:48:17,166 --> 00:48:18,625
No masks, no matter.

680
00:48:18,708 --> 00:48:22,416
For Henry Lyon
turns all before him into gold.

681
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,583
Ha, nonsense! Pewter at best.

682
00:48:25,666 --> 00:48:28,041
What he has done with matches
is legendary.

683
00:48:28,541 --> 00:48:31,458
In two years, he's turned red into black.

684
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:32,916
Or should I say,

685
00:48:33,875 --> 00:48:36,208
red into white?

686
00:48:36,291 --> 00:48:38,541
And to have this humble man
turn his attention

687
00:48:38,625 --> 00:48:40,666
to typhoid and the working poor,

688
00:48:41,333 --> 00:48:44,166
raising funds,
diagnosing cases in the community,

689
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:46,416
I'm overwhelmed. I'm simply overwhelmed.

690
00:48:46,916 --> 00:48:51,041
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you Henry Lyon.

691
00:48:51,125 --> 00:48:56,000
And to his fine son, his heir, William.

692
00:48:58,458 --> 00:48:59,541
To the future.

693
00:49:00,333 --> 00:49:04,291
-To the future.
-May it ever be bright.

694
00:49:06,208 --> 00:49:08,041
Right, Henry, light us up.

695
00:49:09,625 --> 00:49:10,458
Gladly.

696
00:49:15,291 --> 00:49:17,250
Now go and enjoy yourselves.

697
00:49:23,833 --> 00:49:25,916
I believe I've seen that dress
somewhere before.

698
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,083
-Oh yes, last year.

699
00:49:30,416 --> 00:49:32,333
I think it's charming, elegant.

700
00:49:32,958 --> 00:49:34,208
I think you are kind.

701
00:49:48,583 --> 00:49:49,666
Gentlemen.

702
00:49:50,541 --> 00:49:51,375
Ma'am.

703
00:49:52,250 --> 00:49:53,083
Good evening.

704
00:49:56,250 --> 00:49:58,750
This is a wonderful occasion, is it not?

705
00:50:02,125 --> 00:50:07,041
I mean, the guests are just… delightful.

706
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:11,791
And the orchestra is most tuneful.

707
00:50:16,083 --> 00:50:18,125
I was wondering if

708
00:50:19,291 --> 00:50:21,666
I might be able to speak to you, Mr. Lyon.

709
00:50:24,583 --> 00:50:27,500
-Uh, have I said something wrong?
-Where is your chaperone?

710
00:50:28,291 --> 00:50:29,291
Chaperone?

711
00:50:30,250 --> 00:50:33,708
My dear, you can hardly expect my son
to talk to you unaccompanied.

712
00:50:36,541 --> 00:50:38,083
-Oh.

713
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:47,208
I cannot talk to you without a chaperone?

714
00:50:47,291 --> 00:50:48,833
No, of course not.

715
00:50:48,916 --> 00:50:49,875
Honestly?

716
00:50:52,208 --> 00:50:53,083
Honestly?

717
00:50:54,083 --> 00:50:55,375
Who is this woman?

718
00:50:55,458 --> 00:50:57,125
Well, they are talking.

719
00:50:57,208 --> 00:50:58,458
They are dancing.

720
00:50:59,166 --> 00:51:00,875
Good evening, my dear.

721
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,000
Yes.

722
00:51:03,083 --> 00:51:04,375
How foolish of me.

723
00:51:06,125 --> 00:51:06,958
Good evening.

724
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:25,875
It could be claimed,
with some justification,

725
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:27,750
that I might have prepared
more thoroughly.

726
00:51:27,833 --> 00:51:30,000
But dancing is not
one of my core strengths.

727
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,291
Well, except…

728
00:51:32,375 --> 00:51:36,125
♪ Knees up Mother Brown
Under the table you must go ♪

729
00:51:36,208 --> 00:51:37,708
♪ Ee-aye, ee-aye, oh! ♪

730
00:51:39,208 --> 00:51:40,750
You see my situation.

731
00:51:51,958 --> 00:51:53,125
Who are you?

732
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,375
The man's a game player.

733
00:51:57,458 --> 00:51:59,500
Separate filings
from five different accounts.

734
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:02,708
Capable of covering his traces
at every turn. One private bank.

735
00:52:02,791 --> 00:52:06,166
Vanishes and reappears.
No name. Just a number.

736
00:52:13,708 --> 00:52:15,666
Perhaps
a genius in mathematics.

737
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:19,083
Leading me a merry dance.

738
00:52:19,666 --> 00:52:20,541
It's a cipher.

739
00:52:26,375 --> 00:52:27,208
The polka.

740
00:52:28,708 --> 00:52:31,291
The promenade. The two-step.

741
00:52:32,208 --> 00:52:33,708
They're all dances.

742
00:52:33,791 --> 00:52:35,416
Dance, dance, dance, dance.

743
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:36,875
Twenty-seven, turn on…

744
00:52:42,375 --> 00:52:44,416
Yes. The Language of the Dance.

745
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,458
"Twenty-seven dances."

746
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:48,125
I've got you.

747
00:52:48,208 --> 00:52:51,166
Dance one, then 14. 22.

748
00:52:55,916 --> 00:52:58,625
Terrible, aren't they? These things.

749
00:52:59,583 --> 00:53:01,583
All pompidou and popinjay.

750
00:53:02,291 --> 00:53:03,750
Have we met somewhere before?

751
00:53:04,875 --> 00:53:08,166
I feel I recognize you from somewhere.

752
00:53:08,250 --> 00:53:11,416
I simply have one of those faces.

753
00:53:13,875 --> 00:53:14,708
Mira Troy,

754
00:53:15,375 --> 00:53:17,291
private secretary to Lord McIntyre,

755
00:53:18,291 --> 00:53:19,333
Treasury Minister.

756
00:53:20,541 --> 00:53:21,375
Tabitha.

757
00:53:22,708 --> 00:53:24,250
Tabitha Timothy.

758
00:53:27,333 --> 00:53:29,166
You mustn't let them concern you.

759
00:53:29,791 --> 00:53:31,250
It's just a performance.

760
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:34,375
Everyone here is playing a part.

761
00:53:35,166 --> 00:53:36,166
Testing each other.

762
00:53:38,916 --> 00:53:39,750
Winning.

763
00:53:41,375 --> 00:53:42,208
Losing.

764
00:53:43,541 --> 00:53:44,750
And it's fun,

765
00:53:45,708 --> 00:53:47,125
once you know the rules.

766
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,500
What are they doing with those fans?

767
00:53:58,166 --> 00:53:59,666
Sending messages.

768
00:54:00,166 --> 00:54:03,416
Saying everything that is forbidden,

769
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:08,541
or too embarrassing to say aloud.

770
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:15,041
Thank you for the lesson.

771
00:54:16,708 --> 00:54:18,208
It's a lesson hard learned.

772
00:54:20,625 --> 00:54:24,166
Without power, we women
must rely on our wits for our fortune,

773
00:54:24,791 --> 00:54:27,375
because our chances are short. Here.

774
00:54:28,083 --> 00:54:28,916
Take my fan.

775
00:54:30,291 --> 00:54:31,583
I have no use for it.

776
00:54:33,083 --> 00:54:35,958
And if you wish to speak to William,

777
00:54:37,958 --> 00:54:39,541
you could always try with that.

778
00:54:57,166 --> 00:54:58,583
No, not… No, not you. Oh.

779
00:55:01,541 --> 00:55:02,416
Help.

780
00:55:05,083 --> 00:55:06,458
It would be my delight.

781
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,791
Really, there's no need to be rude.

782
00:55:12,875 --> 00:55:14,291
I-I didn't mean to.

783
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,291
Tewkesbury!

784
00:55:31,375 --> 00:55:33,791
-Your timing's impeccable!
-Enola?

785
00:55:33,875 --> 00:55:36,791
Don't speak to me here, otherwise
you'll be thrown onto the street.

786
00:55:41,041 --> 00:55:44,125
-I need you to teach me to dance.
-Teach you to dance? When?

787
00:55:44,208 --> 00:55:46,250
-Teach me to dance now.
-Wh…

788
00:55:46,333 --> 00:55:48,541
You understand
I've been learning since I was five?

789
00:55:48,625 --> 00:55:51,625
Good. I'd feared
you'd be a terrible teacher.

790
00:55:51,708 --> 00:55:54,375
-What are you doing here?
-I'm looking for a murderer.

791
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,416
Though I shouldn't have told you.
Forget I told you that.

792
00:55:57,916 --> 00:56:01,916
-I'm trying to save a girl's life.
-Through dance?

793
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,250
Please, Tewkesbury.

794
00:56:06,458 --> 00:56:09,083
All right. Hold your back straight.

795
00:56:11,083 --> 00:56:14,125
And I'll place my hand here and here.

796
00:56:14,208 --> 00:56:15,583
Oh. Yes.

797
00:56:16,916 --> 00:56:17,791
Hold your arm out.

798
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:20,208
Good.

799
00:56:20,875 --> 00:56:22,958
Now, I will lead and you will follow.

800
00:56:23,041 --> 00:56:25,541
-That seems like a mistake.
-Face over my shoulder.

801
00:56:27,458 --> 00:56:30,500
And now, one, two, three.

802
00:56:31,041 --> 00:56:33,166
Two, three. Two, three.

803
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:36,208
Four, two, three. One, two, three.

804
00:56:36,708 --> 00:56:37,541
Two, three.

805
00:56:38,875 --> 00:56:39,750
Good.

806
00:56:46,208 --> 00:56:48,333
You seem different since last we spoke.

807
00:56:49,541 --> 00:56:51,166
Tell me why you've been
coming to the park.

808
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:53,291
Why… Why watch me walk to the Lords?

809
00:56:54,125 --> 00:56:55,541
Simply keeping an eye on you,

810
00:56:56,041 --> 00:56:58,083
in case you get yourself
into any more scrapes.

811
00:56:58,166 --> 00:57:00,625
-Getting thrown out of trains.
-Enola--

812
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:02,875
You cannot be trusted
to take care of yourself.

813
00:57:03,583 --> 00:57:04,458
I'm a man now.

814
00:57:04,541 --> 00:57:06,250
You're a man when I tell you you're a man.

815
00:57:06,333 --> 00:57:09,333
And the scrapes I find myself in
are far less visceral.

816
00:57:13,125 --> 00:57:14,125
Now, come on.

817
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:18,708
Two, three. Two, three.

818
00:57:18,791 --> 00:57:19,916
Look into my eyes.

819
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,625
The rhythm is always there.

820
00:57:23,583 --> 00:57:25,541
Dancing is a trust, it's a union.

821
00:57:25,625 --> 00:57:27,250
That's why I've always loved it,

822
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:29,958
even when I was being tutored by my uncle.

823
00:57:30,041 --> 00:57:31,750
That man likes a pork mustard pie.

824
00:57:32,625 --> 00:57:33,541
His breath…

825
00:57:34,166 --> 00:57:35,125
Turn, two.

826
00:57:36,791 --> 00:57:37,833
Turn. Feel it?

827
00:57:38,750 --> 00:57:39,583
I can feel it.

828
00:57:48,375 --> 00:57:49,250
Good.

829
00:57:50,416 --> 00:57:52,583
-You dance well.
-Perhaps I have a fine teacher.

830
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:56,875
Though his breath has less mustard
on it than I'd hoped.

831
00:58:18,291 --> 00:58:21,041
-We have an urgent situation.

832
00:58:21,125 --> 00:58:21,958
I should go.

833
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:24,083
You'll need a dance card.

834
00:58:25,416 --> 00:58:26,875
But I don't know enough.

835
00:58:30,041 --> 00:58:31,791
-What does that mean?
-You'll learn.

836
00:58:36,458 --> 00:58:39,416
Don't touch the ginger cake.
Plays hopscotch with your bowels.

837
00:58:51,791 --> 00:58:52,625
Oh.

838
00:58:53,666 --> 00:58:54,583
Hello.

839
00:58:59,833 --> 00:59:02,416
-Mr. Lyon.
-Yes.

840
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:05,000
I was wondering
if we might have a dance this evening.

841
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,166
My dance card is full.

842
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:08,291
May I see it?

843
00:59:16,333 --> 00:59:18,000
Your last waltz is still free.

844
00:59:18,666 --> 00:59:19,791
How fitting.

845
00:59:21,875 --> 00:59:22,875
Would you mind?

846
00:59:34,583 --> 00:59:35,416
Until then.

847
00:59:55,166 --> 00:59:56,083
'Tis he.
