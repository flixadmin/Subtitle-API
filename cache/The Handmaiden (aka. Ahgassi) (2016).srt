1
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,976
JAPANESE DIALOGUE
IS SUBTITLED IN YELLOW

2
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,562
ALL OTHER SUBTITLED DIALOGUE
IS KOREAN

3
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:11,380
You little brats, get lost!

4
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,346
Hey!

5
00:02:52,421 --> 00:02:54,506
It should have been me!

6
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:59,090
I should be the one
going to that Jap's house.

7
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:04,183
You'll miss the train.

8
00:03:05,309 --> 00:03:06,393
Hurry.

9
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,860
PART ONE

10
00:03:38,884 --> 00:03:40,927
KOUZUKI NORIAKI

11
00:03:48,769 --> 00:03:50,687
Go back to sleep.

12
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:52,898
We're still far from the house.

13
00:04:23,971 --> 00:04:26,264
Pleased to meet you.
I am Okju.

14
00:04:26,515 --> 00:04:28,266
This property has three buildings.

15
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:30,435
A Western-style wing designed
by an English architect

16
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:33,522
and a Japanese wing form the main house.

17
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:37,985
Not even in Japan is there
a building combining two styles.

18
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:43,278
It reflects Master's admiration
for Japan and England.

19
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:47,160
Next is the annex

20
00:04:47,369 --> 00:04:50,080
which Master had furnished as a library.

21
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:51,748
Last, the servants' quarters.

22
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,460
As the Lady's handmaiden,
you won't sleep there.

23
00:04:55,085 --> 00:04:57,087
You may eat her leftover food,

24
00:04:57,379 --> 00:04:59,547
but tea leaves go to the kitchen girls.

25
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:02,217
Used soap is for the steward.

26
00:05:02,551 --> 00:05:05,011
Anyone caught stealing
is expelled that day.

27
00:05:05,304 --> 00:05:07,389
I'm sure you wouldn't dare, Tamako.

28
00:05:09,558 --> 00:05:13,770
"Tamako" is you, by the way.
Your name Okju in Japanese.

29
00:05:14,563 --> 00:05:17,023
- Call me Sasaki.
- Yes, ma'am.

30
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:26,029
The Lady's routine is simple.
Taking a walk, or reading for Master.

31
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:32,831
Among the richest men,
Master is the greatest book lover.

32
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:35,834
And among book lovers,
he is the richest.

33
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,087
His ties to the colonial government
even let us use electricity.

34
00:05:39,171 --> 00:05:40,380
In such a home,

35
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:45,302
you know what's expected
of a maid like you?

36
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,891
Don't be alarmed at the blackouts.

37
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,292
I sleep in here?

38
00:06:19,169 --> 00:06:22,088
Miss Hideko wakes easily
on account of her nerves.

39
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,007
She's behind this door?

40
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,712
Mother!

41
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:07,634
Mother!

42
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,679
Mother!

43
00:07:12,222 --> 00:07:13,056
Miss!

44
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:15,392
Miss, are you alright?

45
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,728
Junko!
Is that you?

46
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,107
Junko was kicked out, Miss.
I'm the new girl.

47
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,735
I guess you had a bad dream.

48
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:28,238
You see that big cherry tree?

49
00:07:28,864 --> 00:07:32,701
My aunt went mad and hanged herself there.

50
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:36,162
Sometimes on moonless nights,

51
00:07:36,246 --> 00:07:37,997
my aunt's ghost

52
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:41,710
dangles from that branch.

53
00:07:54,306 --> 00:07:56,099
Here, drink up.

54
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:04,270
When babies cry,
my auntie feeds them a spoonful of sake.

55
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:13,867
Sweet bird, sweet bird

56
00:08:14,576 --> 00:08:17,537
My sweet bluebird

57
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:26,125
What scent is this, that fills my nose?

58
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:33,633
You think I'm Tamako,
a poor Korean handmaiden.

59
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:37,390
But my real name's Nam Sookee.

60
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:42,058
Raised by Miss Boksun,
top purveyor of stolen goods.

61
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:48,026
I was able to tell a real coin
from a fake when I was 5.

62
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,196
Then learned to forge stamps from Gugali,

63
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,992
and studied pickpocketing from Kutan,

64
00:08:55,784 --> 00:08:59,078
but these babies will never
learn such useful skills.

65
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,082
Abandoned as newborns,

66
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:05,544
we'll wash and feed them,
then sell them to Japan.

67
00:09:05,794 --> 00:09:07,587
What a meaningful work.

68
00:09:07,671 --> 00:09:12,171
Instead of starving, they grow up
to be rich gentlemen and ladies.

69
00:09:13,093 --> 00:09:17,593
Kutan only breastfeeds her own kid.
I wouldn't be so miserly.

70
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:22,807
I wish my breasts gave milk.
I'd breastfeed all of them.

71
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:07,605
I'll tell you the story of an interpreter,

72
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:13,024
who bribed his way
into translating for high officials.

73
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:18,075
After helping Japan annex Korea,
he got rights to a gold mine.

74
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:22,204
Now he wants to turn fully Japanese.

75
00:10:22,996 --> 00:10:25,039
So he gets naturalized,

76
00:10:26,166 --> 00:10:29,377
marries the daughter
of a fallen Japanese noble,

77
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:33,715
and adopts his wife's family name Kouzuki.

78
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:38,053
Ba... bas...

79
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:43,346
That bastard builds a mansion,
fills it with books and antiques.

80
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:49,439
He invites Japanese collectors
to his library,

81
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:53,777
holds readings of rare books,
and auctions the books off.

82
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:56,780
He loves books and paintings
like his own flesh,

83
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:58,699
but he can't help parting with a few.

84
00:10:58,782 --> 00:11:02,368
What to do, when he must sell,
but can't bear to?

85
00:11:02,452 --> 00:11:04,412
He sells a fake.

86
00:11:07,207 --> 00:11:11,707
He seeks out a specialist
to create intricate forgeries.

87
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,714
Unlike him, this specialist...

88
00:11:14,798 --> 00:11:17,634
is a real Japanese, of noble birth!

89
00:11:19,428 --> 00:11:22,597
Count Fujiwara from Nagoya.

90
00:11:23,932 --> 00:11:27,226
So, who is this?

91
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,481
It's the wife.
His Japanese wife.

92
00:11:32,649 --> 00:11:35,360
- You'll seduce her...
- Is she pretty?

93
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:38,405
The Jap wife died ages ago
with no children.

94
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:43,364
But the dead wife's
dead sister's living daughter

95
00:11:43,493 --> 00:11:44,952
performs those book readings.

96
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,163
But is she pretty?

97
00:11:46,788 --> 00:11:49,540
An orphan.
Her father was rich.

98
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:53,503
Soon she'll fall in love with me,
and we'll elope to Japan.

99
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,672
After marrying her there,

100
00:11:55,756 --> 00:12:00,010
and inheriting her fortune,
I'll declare her insane

101
00:12:00,093 --> 00:12:02,136
and lock her up in a madhouse.

102
00:12:02,387 --> 00:12:03,221
Right!

103
00:12:04,556 --> 00:12:06,182
Sookee will be my mouse,

104
00:12:06,266 --> 00:12:10,766
work as her maid, eavesdrop on her,

105
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:17,106
stay by her side
and gently persuade her to fall in love.

106
00:12:18,111 --> 00:12:19,112
Love?

107
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:22,240
What does a crook know about love?

108
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:30,791
What of her fortune?
Is she rich for sure?

109
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:35,253
Every night in bed I think of her assets.

110
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:38,757
1.5 million in cash.
300,000 in bonds.

111
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:45,096
The uncle is just a guardian.
It's Hideko's fortune.

112
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:49,017
That's why Kouzuki
schemes to marry the girl.

113
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,853
To his w... wife's niece?

114
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:53,229
What a s... sick f... f...

115
00:12:53,313 --> 00:12:54,897
Right, a sick fuck.

116
00:12:56,733 --> 00:12:58,943
So what's our share?

117
00:13:00,654 --> 00:13:02,280
I'll share 50,000.

118
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:04,449
Sookee also gets
the dresses and jewellery.

119
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,244
I'll do it! Take me!

120
00:13:07,327 --> 00:13:10,747
My Japanese is better,
and I've worked as a maid before!

121
00:13:24,219 --> 00:13:25,887
On top of the fifty,

122
00:13:28,056 --> 00:13:31,976
I get dresses, jewellery
and my own 100,000.

123
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:33,979
She must be crazy...

124
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:37,148
Crazy?
Not a bit.

125
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:40,652
I'll take my fortune
and flee this country.

126
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,949
Endure these country yokels a bit longer.

127
00:14:02,966 --> 00:14:04,968
Those fuckers.

128
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,763
This is Tamako.

129
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:11,766
I am at your service.
Miss...

130
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:14,894
Bloody hell.

131
00:14:17,105 --> 00:14:19,732
He should've told me she was so pretty.

132
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,360
I'm completely flustered.

133
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:24,946
A reference letter

134
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,949
from Lady Minami, my last mistress.

135
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:32,996
Here's the letter.
Pay attention.

136
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,459
"Dear Miss Izumi Hideko,

137
00:14:37,542 --> 00:14:42,042
Count Fujiwara has informed me
of your urgent need for a maid.

138
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:46,259
A maid is like a pair of chopsticks.

139
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:50,843
Her presence is little noted,
but her absence causes much distress."

140
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,935
So, how do you like this place?

141
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:59,189
The sun scarcely ever shines here.

142
00:14:59,272 --> 00:15:01,524
Uncle won't permit it.

143
00:15:01,608 --> 00:15:04,569
Sunlight causes books to fade.

144
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:07,447
One could never grow fond
of such a dreary place.

145
00:15:12,327 --> 00:15:14,871
Not a good liar, are you?

146
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:17,874
I'll take my leave.

147
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:34,850
My head aches
before every reading practice.

148
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,270
Would you read it to me?

149
00:15:40,772 --> 00:15:41,647
Pardon?

150
00:15:51,658 --> 00:15:52,825
Oh, how kind of her.

151
00:15:52,909 --> 00:15:56,787
Lady Minami said
such nice things about me!

152
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:57,914
Is that so?

153
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:05,709
You're a Japanese lady,
why don't you speak Japanese?

154
00:16:06,631 --> 00:16:07,798
I'm sick of it.

155
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,844
The books he makes me read
are all Japanese.

156
00:16:12,053 --> 00:16:13,929
So read that for me.

157
00:16:25,942 --> 00:16:28,235
"Dear Miss Izumi Hideko,

158
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:32,991
Count Fujiwara said
you're looking for a maid.

159
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,952
Maids are like...

160
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,954
a spoon... no...

161
00:16:38,788 --> 00:16:40,956
are like chopsticks..."

162
00:16:45,795 --> 00:16:47,963
Is it a spoon?

163
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,392
I don't know how to read, Miss.

164
00:17:01,978 --> 00:17:04,897
Not at all?
What about Korean?

165
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:32,299
This is your name.
Can't you read it?

166
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,767
Reading can be learned,

167
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,769
and I don't care if you curse or steal.

168
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:49,317
But don't ever lie to me.
Understood?

169
00:17:49,734 --> 00:17:50,776
Yes, Miss.

170
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:57,951
She's my mother.

171
00:17:59,786 --> 00:18:02,830
She's beautiful, quite the charmer!

172
00:18:03,081 --> 00:18:05,708
And me?
Am I "quite the charmer”?

173
00:18:07,877 --> 00:18:10,921
Everyone says
I can't compare to my mother.

174
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,428
Count Fujiwara said...

175
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,014
So you've met the Count?

176
00:18:20,473 --> 00:18:21,307
Pardon?

177
00:18:21,516 --> 00:18:23,518
No, I've never met him...

178
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:27,063
My aunt!
I heard it from my aunt.

179
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:29,149
She was his nanny.

180
00:18:29,899 --> 00:18:31,942
What did the Count say about me?

181
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,031
He said your face...

182
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:41,161
Every night in bed he thinks
of your assets... your face.

183
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:46,541
Why in bed, I wonder?

184
00:18:50,545 --> 00:18:52,547
What's with your foot?

185
00:18:58,803 --> 00:19:00,846
I've nowhere to go.

186
00:19:01,556 --> 00:19:04,892
I've just stayed in this house
since coming to Korea when I was 5.

187
00:19:06,811 --> 00:19:10,815
But in new shoes,
even well-trodden paths feel fresh.

188
00:19:11,566 --> 00:19:12,900
The ones from here

189
00:19:13,818 --> 00:19:15,861
up to here should fit you.

190
00:19:22,285 --> 00:19:24,328
Time for reading practice.

191
00:19:25,288 --> 00:19:26,247
I'll go alone.

192
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,290
Miss?

193
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,582
But rain is falling.

194
00:19:44,891 --> 00:19:48,978
At noon, come knock on the door.
Promise?

195
00:19:52,857 --> 00:19:53,858
See you at...

196
00:19:54,317 --> 00:19:56,902
See you later.

197
00:20:04,577 --> 00:20:05,703
What's this?

198
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:50,039
Why would the lady of such a big house...

199
00:20:58,214 --> 00:21:00,633
Did the big house make her go mad?

200
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,257
My new handmaiden.

201
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,259
The snake, the snake!

202
00:21:50,391 --> 00:21:52,393
You mustn't pass that point.

203
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,312
Be warned!

204
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,857
The snake marks the "bounds of knowledge".

205
00:22:06,157 --> 00:22:07,408
A snake!

206
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,122
The Count?

207
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,249
Today?

208
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,339
That's why you insisted on a bath.

209
00:22:21,422 --> 00:22:24,174
My aunt, when she heard
a guest was coming,

210
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:26,928
dropped everything
and bathed her Baby Miss.

211
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:32,137
Nothing made her happier than
when guests praised her baby's scent.

212
00:22:33,434 --> 00:22:36,437
You are my Baby Miss.

213
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:40,858
Auntie gave the babies candy during baths.

214
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,819
To teach them that bath time is sweet.

215
00:22:43,903 --> 00:22:45,571
What's wrong?

216
00:22:46,906 --> 00:22:50,409
One of my teeth must be sharp.
It keeps cutting me.

217
00:23:35,955 --> 00:23:37,998
So this was the scent.

218
00:24:36,557 --> 00:24:37,641
All smooth.

219
00:24:53,449 --> 00:24:54,908
Welcome, sir!

220
00:25:04,335 --> 00:25:08,547
You are too kind to greet me
this way upon my arrival,

221
00:25:08,631 --> 00:25:11,842
when the journey has left me so unkempt.

222
00:25:11,926 --> 00:25:13,636
Now your tedium is over.

223
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:17,974
I'll ensure your painting lessons
are stimulating.

224
00:25:21,144 --> 00:25:22,436
This must be Okju.

225
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:25,189
At your service, milord.

226
00:25:26,065 --> 00:25:29,943
You know if you fail,
it'll put me in an awkward position?

227
00:25:31,946 --> 00:25:35,908
A decent bone structure for a Korean...

228
00:25:36,492 --> 00:25:40,662
So, are you carrying out
your duties faithfully?

229
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:57,889
Count Fujiwara asks Miss Hideko
to kindly allow her maid Tamako

230
00:25:57,972 --> 00:26:00,975
to be sent to his Lordship
for a brief errand.

231
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:11,777
Did you call for me, milord?

232
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:12,903
You may enter.

233
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:46,520
Everyone's talking about you in Eunpo.

234
00:26:46,979 --> 00:26:50,023
How you'll be an even greater thief
than your mother.

235
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:52,902
Who believes the talk of a swindler?

236
00:26:54,028 --> 00:26:57,448
When I give the signal,
"fully ripe",

237
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:59,617
arrange for her and I to be alone.

238
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,618
Then I'll gobble her up to the pit.

239
00:27:01,702 --> 00:27:05,914
She's so naive,
even if a man pulls on her nipples

240
00:27:05,998 --> 00:27:07,332
she won't know what he wants.

241
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:10,669
So it's your job to tell her

242
00:27:10,753 --> 00:27:13,756
that everything is because of me.

243
00:27:14,423 --> 00:27:17,134
"Oh my, since the Count arrived,

244
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:19,929
your toenails are growing much faster!"

245
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:22,390
That sort of thing, all right?

246
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:24,725
Here, a gift.

247
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:39,490
Oh, he's so thoughtful!

248
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:43,911
That'll be mine
when she goes to the madhouse.

249
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:48,082
It pains my heart to see this poor girl.

250
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:51,127
Have you ever seen sapphires so blue?

251
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,841
Let's take a look...

252
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:02,221
This isn't a sapphire, it's blue spinel.

253
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:07,894
It's all right, Miss.
Spinets are expensive too.

254
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,021
How do you know...?

255
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:15,318
Oh, my Auntie...
I mean, Lady Minami taught me.

256
00:28:16,068 --> 00:28:17,569
But it's fine!

257
00:28:17,653 --> 00:28:19,196
No need to be ashamed at all.

258
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,824
Your average fence
can barely tell them apart.

259
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,451
Is that so?

260
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:40,676
Of all the things I've washed and dressed,

261
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,637
has anything been this pretty?

262
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,351
I'd like to show her
to the people at home.

263
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,644
What would they say?

264
00:28:53,272 --> 00:28:54,815
Probably this?

265
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:58,986
Mesmerising!

266
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:03,032
S... spellbindingly beautiful!

267
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:11,373
He's shameless.

268
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:16,879
B... b... beautiful!

269
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:19,966
... I... I'm utterly speechless
in your presence!

270
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:24,841
If you stutter like that
and make your face go red,

271
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,473
those uppity bitches will feel superior,

272
00:29:27,556 --> 00:29:30,559
and then they'll open up to you,
all right?

273
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:32,979
You try it.

274
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,151
One, two, three!

275
00:29:41,445 --> 00:29:45,449
The Count kept pushing wine on me.

276
00:29:52,623 --> 00:29:53,915
Does it feel okay?

277
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:57,836
It's suffocating.
How do ladies wear such things?

278
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:00,047
You think this is suffocating?

279
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,009
Miss, you're killing me!

280
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:10,224
Dressed up, you look like a lady, too.

281
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,689
I think I know

282
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,192
what the Count meant.

283
00:30:21,944 --> 00:30:23,654
Your face...

284
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,866
Every night in bed,

285
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:30,036
I think of your face.

286
00:30:33,497 --> 00:30:35,081
Don't be silly, Miss.

287
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:45,255
Ladies truly are the dolls of maids.

288
00:30:46,677 --> 00:30:51,098
All these buttons are for my amusement.

289
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,727
If I undo the buttons
and pull out the cords,

290
00:30:56,103 --> 00:30:59,314
then, the sweet things within,

291
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:02,901
those sweet and soft things...

292
00:31:04,862 --> 00:31:09,362
If I were still a pickpocket
I'd slip my hand inside...

293
00:31:42,608 --> 00:31:46,361
Miss, are you truly going
to marry your uncle?

294
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:54,369
That's what he raised me for,
knowing he'd need my fortune.

295
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,289
There's a famous collector in France.

296
00:31:57,373 --> 00:32:00,751
He'll be putting his entire library up
for auction.

297
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:03,838
The gold mine's proceeds
won't cover the cost.

298
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:09,380
If it were me, I'd sell books to buy gold,
not the opposite.

299
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,337
For now,

300
00:32:46,088 --> 00:32:48,381
the Lady needn't go read to the sick fuck

301
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,676
who wants to marry his wife's niece.

302
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:57,095
Instead the fake Count goes
to the Library to make fake books.

303
00:33:00,769 --> 00:33:04,564
The Lady waits for her
2 o'clock art class,

304
00:33:04,648 --> 00:33:06,107
and waits...

305
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:10,654
Poor girl,

306
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:13,532
losing her heart to a fake.

307
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,693
Please, Count!

308
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,121
Sorry to be late.

309
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:44,998
It's no matter.

310
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:57,636
Maybe I need more practice
to give it dimensionality?

311
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,264
Dimensionality... perhaps.

312
00:35:00,347 --> 00:35:04,267
Nonetheless, you have a vision
that transcends mere skill.

313
00:35:04,351 --> 00:35:08,146
As if you see directly
into an object's essence.

314
00:35:08,522 --> 00:35:13,022
For example, the fact that this peach
contains a lot of water.

315
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:16,280
I hesitate to stand before you,

316
00:35:16,363 --> 00:35:18,948
for fear that you might read my thoughts.

317
00:35:27,124 --> 00:35:29,084
That's enough for today.

318
00:35:35,382 --> 00:35:38,176
Almost fully ripe.

319
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,261
Already?

320
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:44,891
Damn...

321
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,272
Do you know what?

322
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:53,942
Since the Count arrived,
your cheeks have grown flushed.

323
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:55,068
Have they?

324
00:36:01,575 --> 00:36:04,286
How did your mother die?

325
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:09,954
When I was a baby,
at a big house, she was hanged...

326
00:36:10,584 --> 00:36:14,546
-I mean, she hanged...
-Hanged herself like my aunt, huh?

327
00:36:15,172 --> 00:36:17,132
Well, pretty much.

328
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:29,061
She must have hugged you
a lot while alive, right?

329
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,402
My mother died giving birth to me.

330
00:36:38,612 --> 00:36:43,112
So it's as if I strangled her myself.

331
00:36:47,287 --> 00:36:50,164
I wish I'd never been born.

332
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:57,131
No baby is ever guilty of being born.

333
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:00,050
If your mother thought
you could understand

334
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:02,678
this is what she'd have said.

335
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:07,641
That she was so lucky
to have you before dying.

336
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,852
That she had no regrets.

337
00:37:15,607 --> 00:37:19,777
Did my mother cry
before they hanged her?

338
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:23,448
Your mother stole a thousand times,

339
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:27,369
was caught just once, and died once.

340
00:37:29,371 --> 00:37:30,747
Did she cry?

341
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,419
She laughed.

342
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:40,591
Said she was lucky
to have you before dying.

343
00:37:40,674 --> 00:37:43,426
That she had no regrets.

344
00:37:49,808 --> 00:37:51,935
Wait here a moment, Miss.

345
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:53,979
I'll go pick mushrooms.

346
00:37:56,273 --> 00:37:59,192
We'll have mushroom stew tonight,
you like that.

347
00:37:59,276 --> 00:38:00,986
I'll go with you.

348
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:03,321
I'll be quick.

349
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:05,657
Before it rains.

350
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:15,917
Good girl...

351
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,175
What a coincidence.

352
00:38:23,675 --> 00:38:24,509
Indeed.

353
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,845
May I sit by you?

354
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,750
The lady sits, shy and trembling.

355
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,545
The gentleman is persistent.

356
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:04,174
The perceptive maid
has stepped out for a moment.

357
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,219
All is well, Sookee.

358
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,389
Everyone's performing
their roles so damned well.

359
00:39:13,141 --> 00:39:14,225
Fucking hell.

360
00:39:17,771 --> 00:39:20,565
You know servants can't use this entrance!

361
00:39:28,907 --> 00:39:30,074
Hey!

362
00:39:35,455 --> 00:39:38,040
I wish I'd never come here.

363
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:42,921
It was wrong to come.

364
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:47,676
Tamako, you brought watercolours, right?

365
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,262
Of course, milord!

366
00:39:50,345 --> 00:39:51,763
Watercolour paints and brushes...

367
00:39:51,847 --> 00:39:53,932
Go and get the oils.

368
00:39:54,016 --> 00:39:58,103
A day like this demands oils, yes!

369
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:44,733
A blackout!
Bring a lantern.

370
00:40:45,275 --> 00:40:46,442
Yes, ma'am.

371
00:40:46,526 --> 00:40:47,527
Hurry!

372
00:40:52,699 --> 00:40:55,368
I need to think.

373
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:58,329
I need to become rich,

374
00:40:58,413 --> 00:41:02,913
sail off to a distant harbour,
eat food I scarcely recognise,

375
00:41:03,001 --> 00:41:06,045
buy my fill of glittering baubles, and...

376
00:41:06,129 --> 00:41:08,172
not think of Hideko.

377
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:11,468
Never think of Hideko...

378
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:41,665
I returned and you didn't
even come to me?

379
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:45,335
It was late, I must have slept.
My apologies.

380
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:49,839
You know how hard it is
to do those readings?

381
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:54,052
Must I remove makeup
and change clothes all by myself?

382
00:41:54,886 --> 00:41:57,513
I feel a nightmare coming.
Sleep here.

383
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,875
He proposed to me.

384
00:42:28,086 --> 00:42:29,754
Next full moon,

385
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:35,381
when my uncle visits his mine,
he wants to elope to Japan.

386
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,890
What did you say?

387
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:44,394
I said I wasn't sure.

388
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:45,520
Why?

389
00:42:46,104 --> 00:42:47,605
I'm scared.

390
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:50,275
Of your uncle's anger?

391
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,029
Of the Count.

392
00:42:55,697 --> 00:42:58,700
What's to be scared of?
He's so kind.

393
00:43:00,994 --> 00:43:03,830
I don't know, I just feel it.

394
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:10,294
Like the reflex of pulling your hand
from a flame.

395
00:43:13,715 --> 00:43:15,675
Tell me...

396
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:25,769
What is it that men want?

397
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,107
Pardon?

398
00:43:31,399 --> 00:43:35,194
I mean after getting married, at night...

399
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:41,659
How would I know?
I'm practically a child.

400
00:43:41,743 --> 00:43:45,747
With no mother.
No one here to...

401
00:43:51,753 --> 00:43:52,754
First,

402
00:43:55,006 --> 00:43:56,757
I guess we'd kiss?

403
00:43:59,094 --> 00:44:00,845
What the hell.

404
00:44:01,054 --> 00:44:03,306
I'll show her one thing
then put her to bed.

405
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:06,685
Poor thing,

406
00:44:06,768 --> 00:44:11,268
alone in a strange country,
reading those useless books,

407
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:16,861
without learning a single useful skill.

408
00:44:34,379 --> 00:44:36,881
Why does the candy taste different?

409
00:44:38,091 --> 00:44:41,302
The bitter turned sour,

410
00:44:41,386 --> 00:44:44,847
the sour turned sweet,

411
00:44:44,931 --> 00:44:48,434
the sweet turned savoury...

412
00:44:48,518 --> 00:44:50,520
How do you know all this?

413
00:44:51,521 --> 00:44:53,564
You must have experience?

414
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:58,570
My friend Kutan taught me.

415
00:44:59,529 --> 00:45:01,572
Taught you?
In words?

416
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:04,200
Yes, only in words.

417
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,680
So this is how it feels.

418
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:28,391
That's what you will feel for the Count.

419
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:30,560
Really?

420
00:45:31,144 --> 00:45:32,937
The Count, truly...

421
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:39,402
He won't think
he's making love to a corpse?

422
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:43,698
You know about my cold hands and feet.

423
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:44,824
Really?

424
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:46,784
Here.

425
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:57,045
Feels just fine.

426
00:45:57,712 --> 00:45:58,754
You like it?

427
00:46:00,548 --> 00:46:03,592
Do it to me.
I want to know how it feels.

428
00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:11,893
I'm sure he'll want to do this too.

429
00:46:12,727 --> 00:46:13,728
And then...

430
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:22,654
It's so cute.

431
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,408
If the Count sees this...

432
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:40,463
Will he really be so tender as this?

433
00:46:41,339 --> 00:46:42,590
Of course.

434
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:45,635
And he'll touch you like this.

435
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:47,679
And like this...

436
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:53,685
Keep doing it like the Count would.

437
00:46:56,229 --> 00:46:59,190
And this is what he'll say.

438
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:04,988
It's so soft, warm,

439
00:47:06,990 --> 00:47:08,992
wet, and...

440
00:47:09,492 --> 00:47:13,954
S... S... spellbindingly beautiful!

441
00:47:33,975 --> 00:47:36,185
Okju.

442
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:40,732
Hideko.

443
00:47:43,651 --> 00:47:46,111
Mummy.

444
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:50,074
Daddy.

445
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:54,328
Now, the model must stay still.

446
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:58,750
Okju.

447
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:05,756
- Hideko...
- Wait.

448
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:07,508
Stop!

449
00:48:08,718 --> 00:48:12,513
...doesn't like it, you damned scoundrel!

450
00:48:14,265 --> 00:48:15,140
Stop it!

451
00:48:15,433 --> 00:48:16,475
I can't do this.

452
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:22,273
Come here, Tamako.

453
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:27,612
Find some other job to do.

454
00:48:27,695 --> 00:48:29,321
You catch my meaning?

455
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:41,000
I've no other job to do.

456
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:44,337
My job is to look after the Lady.

457
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,935
I spit it out without chewing!
All because of you!

458
00:48:59,018 --> 00:49:00,978
She's fully ripe! Fully ripe!

459
00:49:01,062 --> 00:49:03,147
If I miss this fortnight, I'm finished!

460
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:06,525
Can you feel it?
How much I want it?

461
00:49:06,609 --> 00:49:11,109
After fighting so hard
to escape my garbage heap of a life,

462
00:49:11,656 --> 00:49:14,867
you think I'll let you fuck it up,
you bitch?

463
00:49:15,285 --> 00:49:19,785
Shall I tell the Lady
you're nothing but a lowly pickpocket?

464
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:24,085
Fine, I'll have something to tell her too.

465
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:28,464
That you're nothing but the son
of a lowly Korean farmhand and shaman...

466
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:29,382
Sookee.

467
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:31,842
Think of your family at home.

468
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:35,930
Boksun raising babies with her bad back,
and those two idiots.

469
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:38,558
How will they feel
if you go home empty-handed?

470
00:49:38,641 --> 00:49:40,517
Want to shit on your mother's legend?

471
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:42,854
You should go home in glory.

472
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:51,696
So don't push Hideko too hard.

473
00:49:51,779 --> 00:49:53,071
She's got no one on this earth.

474
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:56,868
If you frighten her,
she'll close up hard as a clam.

475
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:00,830
And please...

476
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:06,957
Don't ever again put my hand
on your tiny joke of a cock.

477
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:17,263
Oh my.

478
00:50:18,014 --> 00:50:21,267
Your toenails have grown faster
since the Count arrived.

479
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:23,186
How curious.

480
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:28,149
Miss, doesn't it bother you not to know?

481
00:50:29,192 --> 00:50:32,361
How many ships sail on the wide sea...

482
00:50:32,987 --> 00:50:35,447
People leaving, people returning,

483
00:50:35,865 --> 00:50:38,492
those saying farewell or welcome back.

484
00:50:38,576 --> 00:50:40,995
What's the farthest you've travelled?

485
00:50:41,079 --> 00:50:42,663
The hill beyond the manor?

486
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:52,548
I could be content here,
if you were with me.

487
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:55,927
You're fortunate, Miss.

488
00:50:56,302 --> 00:51:00,222
The man who loves you
has the power to protect you.

489
00:51:00,306 --> 00:51:02,266
That's rare.

490
00:51:02,892 --> 00:51:06,896
But I'm not sure... if I love him.

491
00:51:08,439 --> 00:51:09,982
You do love him.

492
00:51:13,319 --> 00:51:14,820
How do you know?

493
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:18,908
You stare out the window all day.

494
00:51:19,742 --> 00:51:21,910
Turn in your sleep and sigh.

495
00:51:24,622 --> 00:51:25,998
And your toenails.

496
00:51:26,082 --> 00:51:28,125
Even if I say I don't love him,

497
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:32,005
if I say that I love someone else...

498
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:37,594
Me, who has no one on this earth...

499
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:41,055
Do you still want me to marry him?

500
00:51:44,642 --> 00:51:46,602
You will love him.

501
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:03,035
Miss!

502
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:10,918
In the end,

503
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:15,297
Hideko accepted the proposal,
provided that I come to Japan too.

504
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:18,259
The Count, after feigning annoyance
for a bit,

505
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:20,094
nodded his head.

506
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:23,639
On the day her Uncle left
to visit his mine,

507
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:28,185
the Count pretended to go back
to Japan, and hid nearby.

508
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:44,285
You'll have a week of freedom,

509
00:52:44,786 --> 00:52:49,286
but always remember the basement.

510
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,004
Miss!

511
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:26,258
Thank you for travelling
on our ferry today.

512
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:33,098
We will arrive at Shimonoseki
at 7:30 pm...

513
00:54:41,235 --> 00:54:42,736
Finally we're going home.

514
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:44,571
It's been three years...

515
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:38,667
To not steal...

516
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:40,670
To not steal...

517
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:42,671
To not commit adultery...

518
00:55:43,047 --> 00:55:45,132
To not commit adultery...

519
00:55:45,883 --> 00:55:47,634
To not lie...

520
00:55:48,010 --> 00:55:50,137
To not lie...

521
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:44,229
Spider thread pulled into strings

522
00:56:45,109 --> 00:56:49,530
Strumming makes a zither sing

523
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:53,034
Thousand woes

524
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:04,666
Under the blue sky
Only the crows cry

525
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:12,090
How sorrowful my zither

526
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:15,890
My beloved zither

527
00:57:22,563 --> 00:57:24,565
Did you sleep well?

528
00:57:34,742 --> 00:57:35,784
Excuse me.

529
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:37,452
Sorry.

530
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:47,250
The Count paid the innkeeper to spy on us,
afraid we might run off.

531
00:57:48,255 --> 00:57:51,258
Why get dressed?
I've nothing to do anyway.

532
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:55,429
Things are moving too slowly.

533
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:58,724
I fear Hideko might truly go mad.

534
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:01,977
Shall we play "maid", like before?

535
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:09,609
From morning to night
we see no sign of the Count.

536
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:13,572
Certifying the marriage
and converting the inheritance to cash

537
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:15,658
require much work, he says.

538
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:47,439
How cruel can you be?

539
00:58:47,523 --> 00:58:50,734
You plucked the flower, now re-plant it.

540
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:52,820
What do you want?

541
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:56,907
Hurry up and throw her into the madhouse!

542
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,000
A week here...

543
00:59:08,085 --> 00:59:09,586
Then finally...

544
00:59:54,256 --> 00:59:55,674
This way.

545
01:00:06,977 --> 01:00:08,728
Who is that person?

546
01:00:11,023 --> 01:00:12,899
The Countess Lady Fujiwara.

547
01:00:12,983 --> 01:00:15,986
Her maiden name was lzumi Hideko.

548
01:00:17,404 --> 01:00:18,905
And who might you be?

549
01:00:19,365 --> 01:00:20,866
I am the Lady's handmaiden.

550
01:00:21,867 --> 01:00:25,161
Then, what kind of treatment

551
01:00:25,246 --> 01:00:27,873
do you believe your Lady requires?

552
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:45,724
She should be confined in a place

553
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:50,308
where no one can harm her,
and where she can do no harm.

554
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:58,316
Just a few tests, then let's have
lamb chops at the Peace Hotel.

555
01:01:13,127 --> 01:01:15,129
Almost there.
Good work.

556
01:01:17,256 --> 01:01:19,216
Don't be frightened.

557
01:01:54,418 --> 01:01:56,586
Good day, Countess.

558
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:59,215
Do you remember me?

559
01:02:02,551 --> 01:02:03,718
Countess?

560
01:02:12,978 --> 01:02:14,020
What is this?

561
01:02:14,438 --> 01:02:17,607
We mean you no harm, Countess.

562
01:02:17,691 --> 01:02:19,776
We're going to look after you.

563
01:02:20,986 --> 01:02:24,948
You've got the wrong person.
She is the Countess.

564
01:02:25,449 --> 01:02:27,742
Tell them, Your Lordship!

565
01:02:28,994 --> 01:02:33,039
She still believes
she's a Korean handmaiden.

566
01:02:34,416 --> 01:02:37,961
It's because her nanny was Korean.

567
01:02:38,629 --> 01:02:40,797
You scoundrel!

568
01:02:41,966 --> 01:02:44,093
Let go of me, you filthy bitches!

569
01:02:44,176 --> 01:02:47,637
We do not use such language here,
your Ladyship.

570
01:02:47,721 --> 01:02:48,638
Miss!

571
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:57,606
My poor Lady, she's gone nutty.

572
01:02:58,816 --> 01:03:01,109
If it's any help,

573
01:03:01,193 --> 01:03:05,693
this is from her mother,
and she used to cherish it

574
01:03:07,574 --> 01:03:09,742
before going mad.

575
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:16,500
Such a considerate maid.

576
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:21,588
You may have thought that
Hideko is a fool.

577
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:24,424
A fool... maybe not.

578
01:03:25,884 --> 01:03:29,554
I tell you,
right from the start Miss Izumi Hideko...

579
01:03:32,224 --> 01:03:34,559
had always been...

580
01:03:34,935 --> 01:03:35,977
Miss!

581
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:38,564
...a rotten bitch.

582
01:03:44,528 --> 01:03:47,364
PART TWO

583
01:03:47,448 --> 01:03:50,033
I'm not a rotten bitch!
No! No!

584
01:03:57,541 --> 01:03:59,709
Put it in your mouth, Hideko.

585
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:04,631
Hold out your hand.

586
01:04:27,279 --> 01:04:30,115
Next time you feel like talking back,

587
01:04:30,657 --> 01:04:34,118
remember the taste of this metal bead.

588
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:43,294
You'll sleep alone from tonight.

589
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:54,056
All right?

590
01:04:54,264 --> 01:04:55,682
Please give me a light.

591
01:04:56,141 --> 01:04:59,352
We've been ordered to save oil.

592
01:04:59,978 --> 01:05:01,688
You little brat.

593
01:05:01,772 --> 01:05:03,440
Speak Japanese!

594
01:05:05,943 --> 01:05:09,363
In there is a man the size of an ogre

595
01:05:09,988 --> 01:05:14,117
who can't stand
the sound of girls screaming.

596
01:05:14,618 --> 01:05:18,163
If he hears you, he'll burst
in through that door after you.

597
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:21,124
And then?

598
01:05:24,169 --> 01:05:28,590
He'll smother you with his giant body.

599
01:05:29,174 --> 01:05:31,176
So you can't make a sound.

600
01:05:45,732 --> 01:05:46,983
Aunt.

601
01:05:47,484 --> 01:05:49,235
My, my.

602
01:05:50,654 --> 01:05:53,907
Scaring a little girl like that.

603
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:45,209
And me?

604
01:06:46,335 --> 01:06:47,961
Am I pretty too?

605
01:06:52,090 --> 01:06:53,800
Look closely.

606
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:02,184
Everyone says I can't compare

607
01:07:03,018 --> 01:07:05,311
to my big sister.

608
01:07:08,023 --> 01:07:09,024
Day.

609
01:07:09,399 --> 01:07:10,400
Night.

610
01:07:10,776 --> 01:07:11,777
Day.

611
01:07:12,402 --> 01:07:13,611
Night.

612
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:15,447
Man.

613
01:07:16,031 --> 01:07:17,032
Woman.

614
01:07:17,741 --> 01:07:18,783
Man.

615
01:07:19,535 --> 01:07:20,536
Woman.

616
01:07:24,039 --> 01:07:25,040
Eye.

617
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:26,375
Nose.

618
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:28,210
Mouth.

619
01:07:29,044 --> 01:07:30,045
Ear.

620
01:07:31,046 --> 01:07:32,047
Shoulder.

621
01:07:32,756 --> 01:07:33,757
Nipple.

622
01:07:34,341 --> 01:07:35,383
Navel.

623
01:07:36,051 --> 01:07:37,052
Eye.

624
01:07:37,427 --> 01:07:38,428
Nose.

625
01:07:39,054 --> 01:07:40,055
Mouth.

626
01:07:40,722 --> 01:07:41,723
Ear.

627
01:07:42,057 --> 01:07:43,099
Shoulder.

628
01:07:43,767 --> 01:07:44,809
Nipple.

629
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:46,228
Navel.

630
01:07:49,773 --> 01:07:50,815
Penis.

631
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:52,568
Vagina.

632
01:07:58,699 --> 01:08:00,701
P... penis.

633
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:03,078
Vagina.

634
01:08:39,114 --> 01:08:43,076
You think if you speak Korean,
I won't understand?

635
01:08:45,245 --> 01:08:49,745
I was going a bit crazy,
so I made them crazy too.

636
01:08:54,546 --> 01:08:57,882
When Mrs. Sasaki looked as crazy as me,

637
01:08:57,966 --> 01:09:00,009
life was more bearable.

638
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:06,475
I know you are a bit insane.

639
01:09:07,184 --> 01:09:10,854
It runs in your mother's family.

640
01:09:11,396 --> 01:09:13,773
That's why I'm training you.

641
01:09:13,857 --> 01:09:15,191
To set your mind right.

642
01:09:15,609 --> 01:09:20,109
If I fail, there's a place called
a "mental hospital" in Japan.

643
01:09:24,201 --> 01:09:27,120
Established by the rational Germans,

644
01:09:27,204 --> 01:09:30,582
it's very effective in treating lunacy.

645
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:35,128
They dig holes in the dirt,
put a patient in each one,

646
01:09:35,212 --> 01:09:36,755
and put lids on top.

647
01:09:36,838 --> 01:09:41,133
If patients improve they get a leash,

648
01:09:41,218 --> 01:09:43,970
so they can crawl around like dogs.

649
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:14,334
The cherry tree that came with me
on the ship from Japan

650
01:10:14,418 --> 01:10:16,420
bloomed twice.

651
01:10:17,879 --> 01:10:20,965
"When Jinlian finally took off
her clothes,

652
01:10:21,049 --> 01:10:24,177
Ximen-Qing-examined her-Jade-Gate...

653
01:10:24,261 --> 01:10:28,265
To-find-it-hairless-white-as-snow
and-smooth-as-jade..."

654
01:10:30,851 --> 01:10:33,270
You must pause between words.

655
01:10:33,895 --> 01:10:36,939
Don't read like a dog lapping
at his plate!

656
01:10:39,276 --> 01:10:42,237
Listen to your aunt read.

657
01:10:49,286 --> 01:10:53,748
"When Jinlian finally took off
her clothes,

658
01:10:54,040 --> 01:10:57,752

659
01:10:57,836 --> 01:10:59,754
DISCOVERING THE SECRET WELL

660
01:10:59,838 --> 01:11:03,299
to find it hairless, white as snow,

661
01:11:03,925 --> 01:11:06,260
and smooth as jade.

662
01:11:06,511 --> 01:11:09,222
Tight as a drum,

663
01:11:09,306 --> 01:11:11,349
and soft as silk.

664
01:11:12,350 --> 01:11:16,850
Once he drew apart the curtains of flesh,

665
01:11:18,523 --> 01:11:23,023
a scent of well-aged wine
emanated from within,

666
01:11:25,322 --> 01:11:29,822
and on fold upon fold
of the red velvet interior

667
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:32,996
beads of dew were forming.

668
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:38,289
Its centre was dark and void,

669
01:11:39,836 --> 01:11:43,214
yet as if it had its own life,

670
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:48,053
it twitched and twitched.”

671
01:12:16,039 --> 01:12:20,251
Everyone wanted to cut it down,
but my uncle refused.

672
01:12:21,044 --> 01:12:25,544
He said this tree from Mt. Fuji
had absorbed my aunt's soul.

673
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:31,300
The servants whispered it was
due to the tree's high cost,

674
01:12:32,472 --> 01:12:35,475
but I think my uncle was right.

675
01:12:36,059 --> 01:12:38,853
You can tell from the cherry blossoms,

676
01:12:38,937 --> 01:12:42,482
which turned brighter and bloomed longer.

677
01:13:15,473 --> 01:13:17,725
"Tell me, Juliette.

678
01:13:18,018 --> 01:13:22,518
Do you wish
this impetuous young knight will save you?

679
01:13:30,614 --> 01:13:34,451
The duchess shook her head resolutely,

680
01:13:34,534 --> 01:13:37,745
to my great disappointment.

681
01:13:40,206 --> 01:13:41,248
Now...

682
01:13:42,208 --> 01:13:44,251
...my brave knight."

683
01:13:49,299 --> 01:13:51,676
Oh, it's a new face!

684
01:13:54,888 --> 01:13:55,889
Now...

685
01:13:56,306 --> 01:13:58,558
...my brave knight.

686
01:13:59,559 --> 01:14:04,059
When you see these old scars
and the fresh pink wounds,

687
01:14:06,316 --> 01:14:08,359
what do you feel?

688
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:14,157
I pity the poor woman.

689
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:18,740
I wish to lick her and lick her,
caress her and caress her.

690
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:22,623
If you pity her so,

691
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:27,879
why not take her place
and let her whip you?

692
01:14:34,761 --> 01:14:39,098
The duchess raised the whip
high in the air, and then...

693
01:14:46,815 --> 01:14:48,608
And again...

694
01:14:56,574 --> 01:14:59,577
My cock became painfully erect.

695
01:15:05,208 --> 01:15:09,128
If she could be yours for ten minutes,

696
01:15:09,212 --> 01:15:11,631
what would you give in exchange?

697
01:15:12,007 --> 01:15:15,343
Whatever your heart desires.

698
01:15:15,635 --> 01:15:18,638
Anything in this whole wide world.

699
01:15:20,015 --> 01:15:23,560
Once the duke untied me,

700
01:15:23,643 --> 01:15:27,647
I sat on the chair, pulled her to me,

701
01:15:28,064 --> 01:15:32,564
and slid my cock into her cunt.

702
01:15:37,657 --> 01:15:40,660
Oh, Juliette, Juliette...

703
01:15:43,121 --> 01:15:47,621
As I felt the duke approach from behind,

704
01:15:48,043 --> 01:15:50,670
a rope slithered around my neck.

705
01:15:52,297 --> 01:15:55,425
The duke slowly tightened the rope.

706
01:15:55,508 --> 01:16:00,008
Like a drowning man grasping at straws,

707
01:16:00,221 --> 01:16:04,683
I pulled the swirling currents
of her hair.

708
01:16:05,852 --> 01:16:08,396
Then the duke spoke.

709
01:16:10,690 --> 01:16:13,651
The ten minutes are almost up.

710
01:16:23,661 --> 01:16:27,498
Slowly, my dear, said the Duchess...

711
01:16:28,291 --> 01:16:32,712
I haven't yet fully savoured his pain.

712
01:16:38,968 --> 01:16:42,638
No, the knight cried, don't stop!

713
01:16:44,599 --> 01:16:47,727
Please let me die

714
01:16:47,811 --> 01:16:49,854
in the midst of this pain.

715
01:16:50,522 --> 01:16:53,191
In this suffocating pain.

716
01:17:27,642 --> 01:17:29,268
Is it Sade?

717
01:17:29,853 --> 01:17:32,021
It's Sade-esque.

718
01:17:32,105 --> 01:17:36,605
Believed to be the same Japanese man
who wrote The Lizard Skin.

719
01:17:37,902 --> 01:17:42,402
Acquired from a Japanese sailor
on a ship from Hamburg.

720
01:17:45,869 --> 01:17:49,789
Can you imagine my joy

721
01:17:49,873 --> 01:17:54,373
when it sat on my shelf
with its brothers after such a journey?

722
01:17:54,878 --> 01:17:59,378
These are the babes
to whom I feel the most affection.

723
01:18:00,884 --> 01:18:05,384
It used to contain an elaborate
monochrome woodcut illustration,

724
01:18:09,309 --> 01:18:10,601
but as you can see...

725
01:18:10,852 --> 01:18:12,895
So unfortunate.

726
01:18:13,104 --> 01:18:17,604
If that were intact,
you could've named your price.

727
01:18:17,901 --> 01:18:22,196
The author felt words alone
could not fully describe the positions,

728
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:25,908
and so included an illustration.

729
01:18:27,243 --> 01:18:30,871
In that regard,
before we start the bidding.

730
01:18:31,372 --> 01:18:32,373
Hideko!

731
01:18:35,877 --> 01:18:39,005
PAIN IS A GARMENT

732
01:19:53,162 --> 01:19:54,454
Beautiful!

733
01:20:01,004 --> 01:20:03,006
See you again.

734
01:20:03,756 --> 01:20:04,798
Yes, thank you.

735
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:09,261
Today's reading was outstanding.

736
01:20:09,554 --> 01:20:10,930
Yes, thank you.

737
01:20:12,765 --> 01:20:14,558
Especially the puppet!

738
01:20:21,607 --> 01:20:23,567
You are of noble birth,

739
01:20:23,651 --> 01:20:28,151
yet you engage in the lowly work
of copying paintings.

740
01:20:28,406 --> 01:20:31,575
There was a time

741
01:20:31,659 --> 01:20:35,245
when I dissipated my wit and skills
on gambling.

742
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:38,958
Imagine the torment
of having so many women

743
01:20:39,042 --> 01:20:40,960
make advances on me,

744
01:20:41,044 --> 01:20:44,338
when I couldn't afford
to buy them a glass of Burgundy.

745
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:49,802
Do the women here advance on you?

746
01:20:50,261 --> 01:20:52,304
I look at women's eyes.

747
01:20:52,388 --> 01:20:54,056
Only the eyes.

748
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:58,018
They turn their gaze away,

749
01:20:58,811 --> 01:21:01,396
but then they always look back.

750
01:21:02,231 --> 01:21:06,731
If I were to slide
under someone's covers tonight,

751
01:21:07,236 --> 01:21:11,114
only one woman here would refuse me.

752
01:21:12,075 --> 01:21:14,619
Does that include Mrs. Sasaki?

753
01:21:15,578 --> 01:21:18,080
Is she not your former wife?

754
01:21:18,414 --> 01:21:21,417
You left her to marry a Japanese woman.

755
01:21:21,834 --> 01:21:26,004
But the servants tell me
you still share a bed with her.

756
01:21:26,089 --> 01:21:28,382
You went so far as to abandon your wife,

757
01:21:28,466 --> 01:21:31,093
why this urge to become Japanese?

758
01:21:33,429 --> 01:21:35,097
Because Korea is ugly

759
01:21:35,556 --> 01:21:38,433
and Japan is beautiful.

760
01:21:39,727 --> 01:21:42,813
Some Japanese say Japan is ugly,

761
01:21:42,897 --> 01:21:44,899
and Korea is beautiful.

762
01:21:44,982 --> 01:21:47,401
Beauty is cruel by nature.

763
01:21:47,485 --> 01:21:51,447
Korea is soft, slow, dull,
and therefore hopeless.

764
01:21:53,116 --> 01:21:57,078
Does it include Mrs. Sasaki?

765
01:21:57,995 --> 01:21:59,621
If I gave her the right signal,

766
01:21:59,705 --> 01:22:04,126
she'd knock on my door
without her underwear.

767
01:22:08,131 --> 01:22:10,174
My thoughts exactly.

768
01:22:12,468 --> 01:22:14,136
Then who is it?

769
01:22:14,429 --> 01:22:17,140
The one who would deny you?

770
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:22,061
I heard you own the highest quality

771
01:22:22,145 --> 01:22:25,898
antique bookmaking tools of East and West,

772
01:22:26,649 --> 01:22:28,275
but I don't see them here?

773
01:22:28,359 --> 01:22:32,112
Who would deny you?

774
01:22:34,782 --> 01:22:39,282
I met Hideko's eyes by chance,
but she didn't look away.

775
01:22:39,829 --> 01:22:43,082
Indeed it was I who shifted my gaze.

776
01:22:43,166 --> 01:22:47,666
Will she make an appearance
in your lewd dreams tonight?

777
01:22:52,008 --> 01:22:55,261
Even if honoured with such a visit,

778
01:22:55,344 --> 01:22:57,304
I don't think I could consummate.

779
01:22:57,889 --> 01:23:01,183
Because her body
would be as cold as waterfowl.

780
01:23:06,230 --> 01:23:09,191
The result of long training.

781
01:23:12,945 --> 01:23:15,948
I heard you are engaged to her.

782
01:23:16,407 --> 01:23:20,907
If I'm not mistaken,
you are yet to have intercourse?

783
01:23:24,832 --> 01:23:27,626
Her eyes have no desire.

784
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:31,171
It means her soul is dead inside.

785
01:23:32,465 --> 01:23:34,758
You should go easy on her training,

786
01:23:34,842 --> 01:23:38,220
unless you enjoy making love to a corpse.

787
01:24:30,064 --> 01:24:33,859
My particular way of possessing beauty.

788
01:24:35,319 --> 01:24:38,780
Hideko too must have received
painting lessons?

789
01:24:38,864 --> 01:24:42,868
I was too occupied teaching her
to read with correct diction.

790
01:24:43,452 --> 01:24:44,494
Dear me!

791
01:24:44,829 --> 01:24:47,039
In England, where I studied,

792
01:24:47,123 --> 01:24:51,623
all ladies were expected to produce
vibrant colour and graceful lines,

793
01:24:54,463 --> 01:24:57,215
even in the less noble families.

794
01:25:11,314 --> 01:25:13,316
A phone call, sir.

795
01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:16,068
At this hour?

796
01:25:16,152 --> 01:25:18,154
It's the lwamura Bookstore.

797
01:25:18,821 --> 01:25:19,822
Is that so?

798
01:25:20,156 --> 01:25:22,158
Excuse me a moment.

799
01:25:32,168 --> 01:25:34,086
You are mesmerising.

800
01:25:35,588 --> 01:25:37,256
Men use the word "mesmerising”

801
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:41,552
when they wish to touch a lady's breasts.

802
01:25:42,470 --> 01:25:46,474
I'm familiar
with Western conversational etiquette.

803
01:25:48,225 --> 01:25:51,353
I do a bit of reading, you know.

804
01:25:51,854 --> 01:25:54,189
There was no calculation in what I said.

805
01:25:54,273 --> 01:25:58,773
It was a reflex,
like pulling one's hand from a flame.

806
01:26:00,196 --> 01:26:01,447
I'm no flame.

807
01:26:02,031 --> 01:26:05,409
I'm cold as waterfowl, your Lordship.

808
01:26:11,415 --> 01:26:13,333
He will return soon.

809
01:26:13,417 --> 01:26:16,211
Mr. Iwamura only called
with a frivolous inquiry,

810
01:26:16,295 --> 01:26:18,338
at my request.

811
01:26:18,422 --> 01:26:21,716
There's an issue regarding
your future you should know.

812
01:26:22,134 --> 01:26:25,428
I'll wait by the stone lamp at midnight.

813
01:26:27,098 --> 01:26:30,559
That Iwamura is a real fool.

814
01:27:19,191 --> 01:27:21,276
My maid is asleep in the room next door.

815
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:23,904
I don't fancy being
in scandalous rumours with you.

816
01:27:23,988 --> 01:27:27,241
I saw Junko go to the servants' quarters
with her pillow.

817
01:27:27,324 --> 01:27:29,701
Consider your reputation as a nobleman.

818
01:27:30,244 --> 01:27:32,079
I'm no nobleman.

819
01:27:32,163 --> 01:27:33,664
I'm not even Japanese.

820
01:27:33,914 --> 01:27:37,584
Do you think it was easy
for a Korean farmhand's son to reach here?

821
01:27:37,668 --> 01:27:41,630
After fifteen hard years in Japan,
I heard some things about you.

822
01:27:41,714 --> 01:27:43,757
Another three years were spent to prepare.

823
01:27:44,341 --> 01:27:47,635
I studied bookmaking
and learned to paint forgeries.

824
01:27:47,928 --> 01:27:50,013
All so that I could meet you.

825
01:27:50,264 --> 01:27:51,807
To seduce and marry you,

826
01:27:51,891 --> 01:27:54,268
to possess your father's inheritance,

827
01:27:54,977 --> 01:27:57,020
and then probably to get rid of you.

828
01:27:58,773 --> 01:28:00,524
But I knew as soon as I met you.

829
01:28:00,775 --> 01:28:03,110
For a man to seduce you would be...

830
01:28:05,237 --> 01:28:06,696
...impossible.

831
01:28:08,282 --> 01:28:11,493
So in place of seduction,
I decided to propose a deal.

832
01:28:12,870 --> 01:28:16,415
Most marriages are like being imprisoned,
but this one will free you.

833
01:28:17,249 --> 01:28:19,042
I'll rescue you from here,

834
01:28:19,126 --> 01:28:22,671
take you far away, and give you freedom.

835
01:28:24,131 --> 01:28:26,341
Of course, we'll split the money.

836
01:28:27,426 --> 01:28:29,177
Nonsense.

837
01:28:29,804 --> 01:28:34,304
Marrying an old man with a black tongue
at your tender age makes sense?

838
01:28:34,433 --> 01:28:36,435
I won't marry anyone.

839
01:28:36,685 --> 01:28:38,269
What have you in mind?

840
01:28:43,984 --> 01:28:45,527
That's not proper.

841
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:47,196
There's no beauty in that.

842
01:28:47,738 --> 01:28:49,948
If you kill yourself,
what of your fortune?

843
01:28:50,616 --> 01:28:55,116
That will be the sum of your efforts?
Your fortune going to that pervert?

844
01:28:55,538 --> 01:28:59,625
So he can buy 10 little girls
and teach them to read books?

845
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:03,295
My uncle will find us somehow.

846
01:29:03,671 --> 01:29:05,589
Then he'll take us to the basement.

847
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:07,174
Uncle.

848
01:29:08,342 --> 01:29:09,259
The basement?

849
01:29:09,343 --> 01:29:12,512
It says here when people are hanged,

850
01:29:12,596 --> 01:29:17,096
their tongues stick out
and faeces is expelled.

851
01:29:18,602 --> 01:29:22,397
But that day, aunt's mouth was shut

852
01:29:23,399 --> 01:29:25,442
and her bottom was clean.

853
01:29:26,902 --> 01:29:28,904
Do you want to go somewhere nice?

854
01:29:46,755 --> 01:29:50,675
I'll tell you in detail
what I did to your aunt

855
01:29:50,759 --> 01:29:52,761
after I caught her running away.

856
01:29:53,053 --> 01:29:57,553
So don't you ever think of running,
understood?

857
01:30:15,618 --> 01:30:17,745
That day I just watched and listened.

858
01:30:17,828 --> 01:30:21,498
But if I ever end up there again...

859
01:30:26,337 --> 01:30:27,963
Highly concentrated opium.

860
01:30:28,047 --> 01:30:30,340
Three drops will make you sleep all day.

861
01:30:30,424 --> 01:30:33,260
Five drops will knock down a horse.

862
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:35,929
If you crave death within five minutes,

863
01:30:36,263 --> 01:30:37,973
drink it all.

864
01:30:38,057 --> 01:30:41,393
If you carry this,
he can never take you to the basement.

865
01:30:41,477 --> 01:30:42,978
At least not alive.

866
01:30:43,771 --> 01:30:45,647
It'll be my wedding gift to you.

867
01:30:46,148 --> 01:30:47,983
It's more expensive than jewels.

868
01:30:59,411 --> 01:31:03,911
Bring a girl to be my maid.
One who could disappear and not be missed.

869
01:31:04,750 --> 01:31:06,418
If a bit dense, all the better.

870
01:31:06,502 --> 01:31:10,797
We'll send her to a madhouse
under my name.

871
01:31:11,465 --> 01:31:13,717
I can find you a new maid,

872
01:31:13,801 --> 01:31:15,761
but what do we do about Junko?

873
01:31:21,475 --> 01:31:25,975
You really think
I'm prettier than Miss Hideko?

874
01:31:27,731 --> 01:31:31,776
Sure, Hideko's pretty, and you're pretty.

875
01:31:31,860 --> 01:31:33,903
What?
You speak Korean?

876
01:31:35,489 --> 01:31:36,823
You know...

877
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:39,118
I learned it.

878
01:31:39,535 --> 01:31:42,538
To speak more easily with you.

879
01:31:43,539 --> 01:31:46,500
I really wanted to say this to you.

880
01:31:47,668 --> 01:31:49,086
You are just mesmerising.

881
01:31:49,169 --> 01:31:50,461
Oh my gosh!

882
01:31:52,506 --> 01:31:54,466
You little tart!

883
01:31:59,513 --> 01:32:00,597
I can't!

884
01:32:01,557 --> 01:32:04,518
If they catch me with a guest,
I'll be thrown out!

885
01:32:05,686 --> 01:32:09,731
Forget this wretched place.
Come live with me!

886
01:32:56,904 --> 01:32:58,280
Oh, fucking hell!

887
01:32:59,198 --> 01:33:00,282
Fucking hell?

888
01:33:00,365 --> 01:33:01,574
Fucking hell...

889
01:33:31,480 --> 01:33:34,191
The Count sent exactly what I ordered.

890
01:33:34,274 --> 01:33:36,734
Naive and a bit foolish.

891
01:33:40,114 --> 01:33:41,740
Mother!

892
01:33:52,751 --> 01:33:57,251
Show Sookee your clothes
and jewellery at every opportunity.

893
01:33:57,923 --> 01:34:02,260
The material greed she got from her mother
will make her more gullible.

894
01:34:02,344 --> 01:34:06,844
P.S. Don't worry if she reads this letter,
she's totally illiterate.

895
01:34:08,559 --> 01:34:09,935
Would you read it to me?

896
01:34:10,435 --> 01:34:11,269
Pardon?

897
01:34:11,353 --> 01:34:12,479
COUNTESS FUJIWARA HIDEKO

898
01:34:12,563 --> 01:34:15,649
This is your name.
Can't you read it?

899
01:34:20,779 --> 01:34:22,489
What's with your foot?

900
01:34:26,535 --> 01:34:27,744
Who did it?

901
01:34:28,162 --> 01:34:30,747
Who took Tamako's shoe?

902
01:34:37,546 --> 01:34:39,798
Apologise before all the servants!

903
01:34:43,051 --> 01:34:46,012
If she ever runs away
because of one of you,

904
01:34:46,096 --> 01:34:48,431
I'll strip you all naked
and throw you out!

905
01:34:49,766 --> 01:34:51,058
Fucking hell.

906
01:34:55,564 --> 01:34:56,856
All smooth.

907
01:35:03,822 --> 01:35:05,365
You like the scent?

908
01:35:06,158 --> 01:35:07,617
Want to come in?

909
01:35:07,826 --> 01:35:08,827
Pardon?

910
01:35:25,928 --> 01:35:27,763
No need to be ashamed at all.

911
01:35:27,846 --> 01:35:30,056
Your average fence
can barely tell them apart.

912
01:35:30,140 --> 01:35:32,225
Is that so?

913
01:35:37,731 --> 01:35:39,858
"Returning the earrings you loaned me.

914
01:35:40,359 --> 01:35:43,403
A woman might wager her fate
on such an exquisite pair.

915
01:35:44,446 --> 01:35:47,031
I'm sure that
Sookee will try her very best

916
01:35:47,115 --> 01:35:51,615
in order to see herself
wearing these in the mirror.

917
01:35:52,371 --> 01:35:55,665
I'll tell you how to keep her
from getting suspicious.

918
01:35:55,958 --> 01:35:59,044
Keep her busy
until the day of the wedding.

919
01:35:59,628 --> 01:36:01,713
Make her spend all her energy

920
01:36:01,797 --> 01:36:04,341
on making you fall in love with me."

921
01:36:06,009 --> 01:36:09,846
In other words,
don't fall in love with me so easily.

922
01:36:11,556 --> 01:36:12,390
Me?

923
01:36:21,566 --> 01:36:23,985
Dressed up, you look like a lady too.

924
01:36:31,868 --> 01:36:34,120
How did your mother die?

925
01:36:34,830 --> 01:36:38,250
That she was so lucky
to have you before dying.

926
01:36:39,126 --> 01:36:41,169
That she had no regrets.

927
01:36:42,421 --> 01:36:46,716
Is this the companionship
they write about in books?

928
01:36:54,516 --> 01:36:56,059
Men are disgusting.

929
01:36:56,601 --> 01:36:59,353
How can they be so single-minded?

930
01:36:59,938 --> 01:37:01,522
What's on my mind?

931
01:37:02,566 --> 01:37:06,027
You don't really believe
that I crave your body?

932
01:37:07,779 --> 01:37:08,613
You do!

933
01:37:08,989 --> 01:37:10,699
You read too many of those books.

934
01:37:10,782 --> 01:37:12,658
If there's one thing I'm after, Miss...

935
01:37:13,785 --> 01:37:18,285
It's not your eyes, your hands or ass,

936
01:37:19,249 --> 01:37:21,584
it's your money, only that.

937
01:37:22,336 --> 01:37:24,963
Of all that you have, money is the best.

938
01:37:26,757 --> 01:37:30,051
It feels great being so rude
to a noble lady.

939
01:37:30,594 --> 01:37:32,345
What's with her?

940
01:37:33,096 --> 01:37:37,225
Why does she stomp her feet,
expressing her anger,

941
01:37:37,309 --> 01:37:40,061
sit up in the middle of the night
and sigh?

942
01:37:41,438 --> 01:37:45,859
Every time she sees the Count,
her eyes seem to say,

943
01:37:46,401 --> 01:37:48,069
I despise you.

944
01:37:48,945 --> 01:37:53,445
Try to bear it. Only if she sees this
will she believe the proposal.

945
01:38:13,428 --> 01:38:17,140
Think of me as that puppet,
and I'll imagine another woman.

946
01:38:17,724 --> 01:38:19,434
What woman?

947
01:38:22,437 --> 01:38:24,439
The duchess Juliette.

948
01:38:26,942 --> 01:38:27,984
Lady!

949
01:38:29,236 --> 01:38:31,196
Milord!

950
01:38:36,368 --> 01:38:37,619
Lady...

951
01:38:41,540 --> 01:38:45,418
"The lady's emotions lay deep inside...

952
01:38:45,752 --> 01:38:48,588
Jinlian could not fathom their depths.

953
01:38:50,382 --> 01:38:52,425
Knowing this, Lady Sun

954
01:38:52,509 --> 01:38:56,596
gave Jinlian four small silver balls.

955
01:38:56,680 --> 01:39:01,180
These are 'minting',
or 'bells of passion'.

956
01:39:01,309 --> 01:39:04,937
Place two in the lady's Jade Gate,

957
01:39:05,021 --> 01:39:08,149
and the other two in yours.

958
01:39:10,735 --> 01:39:12,778
Spread your legs apart

959
01:39:12,863 --> 01:39:15,407
and like two scissors

960
01:39:15,490 --> 01:39:17,742
trying to cut each other,
put them together.

961
01:39:17,826 --> 01:39:20,829
When the lips below rub
against each another,

962
01:39:20,912 --> 01:39:22,830
you'll hear a clear ringing sound.

963
01:39:22,914 --> 01:39:24,749
A blackout!
Bring a lantern!

964
01:39:25,167 --> 01:39:26,668
Yes, sir!

965
01:39:26,751 --> 01:39:28,711
THE SOUND OF BELLS
ON A WINDLESS NIGHT

966
01:39:30,630 --> 01:39:34,634
'When do I put this in?'
asked Jinlian.

967
01:39:35,719 --> 01:39:40,181
Does the lady breathe deeply
and swallow hard?

968
01:39:41,683 --> 01:39:44,602
Does she whisper sweetly in your ear,

969
01:39:44,686 --> 01:39:46,396
and kiss you?

970
01:39:51,610 --> 01:39:53,737
Does she embrace you tightly

971
01:39:53,820 --> 01:39:56,197
and caress your nipples?

972
01:39:58,158 --> 01:40:00,410
Does her secret part become slippery

973
01:40:00,494 --> 01:40:03,163
as she gently bites your shoulder?

974
01:40:03,830 --> 01:40:07,333
Then, put in the bells.”

975
01:40:11,713 --> 01:40:16,050
-Amazing!
-Indeed!

976
01:40:33,485 --> 01:40:35,570
It's so cute.

977
01:40:41,034 --> 01:40:42,910
If the Count sees this...

978
01:40:50,043 --> 01:40:52,879
Will he really be so tender as this?

979
01:40:54,047 --> 01:40:55,006
Of course.

980
01:40:55,215 --> 01:40:58,468
And he'll touch you like this...

981
01:40:59,427 --> 01:41:00,886
And like this...

982
01:41:09,062 --> 01:41:10,855
Tamako, keep doing it.

983
01:41:12,065 --> 01:41:13,775
Like the Count would.

984
01:41:16,486 --> 01:41:17,695
The Count...

985
01:41:18,071 --> 01:41:19,197
The Count...

986
01:41:20,073 --> 01:41:22,283
He'll go crazy over this.

987
01:41:24,995 --> 01:41:28,498
And this is what he'll say.

988
01:41:30,292 --> 01:41:34,792
It's so soft, warm, wet, and...

989
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:44,514
S... S... spellbindingly beautiful!

990
01:42:16,338 --> 01:42:19,341
Shall I teach you more, Miss?

991
01:42:19,507 --> 01:42:21,425
Yes...

992
01:42:22,427 --> 01:42:24,429
Teach me everything.

993
01:43:08,598 --> 01:43:13,098
I wish that I had breast milk
so I could feed you.

994
01:43:28,243 --> 01:43:30,286
Do you like it when I do this?

995
01:43:31,538 --> 01:43:32,914
Do you like me?

996
01:43:34,874 --> 01:43:37,543
Can you promise that you won't betray me?

997
01:43:39,254 --> 01:43:40,546
I'll never...

998
01:43:40,964 --> 01:43:42,006
never...

999
01:43:43,508 --> 01:43:45,468
ever...

1000
01:43:58,982 --> 01:44:03,482
Miss, how could such an innocent...

1001
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:07,573
You must be a natural.

1002
01:45:03,296 --> 01:45:04,588
Stop!

1003
01:45:06,174 --> 01:45:09,302
I spit it out without chewing!
All because of you!

1004
01:45:10,094 --> 01:45:11,428
She's got no one on this earth.

1005
01:45:11,513 --> 01:45:14,974
If you frighten her,
she'll close up hard as a clam.

1006
01:45:21,981 --> 01:45:23,065
You see?

1007
01:45:24,442 --> 01:45:27,111
If you don't give the impression
you want this marriage,

1008
01:45:27,195 --> 01:45:30,489
she may throw another fit
and refuse to go forward.

1009
01:45:30,573 --> 01:45:33,784
Be more convincing
when you pretend to love me.

1010
01:45:33,868 --> 01:45:35,119
I can't do it.

1011
01:45:35,203 --> 01:45:36,037
What?

1012
01:45:36,913 --> 01:45:38,372
I want to quit.

1013
01:45:39,707 --> 01:45:41,917
What's with you all today?

1014
01:45:44,170 --> 01:45:46,046
You feel sorry for her?

1015
01:45:49,133 --> 01:45:51,343
What is it with women?

1016
01:45:54,264 --> 01:45:58,268
You know what that poor Sookee said
about your Ladyship?

1017
01:45:58,476 --> 01:46:02,021
That you're too naive to get it
even if someone pulls on your nipples.

1018
01:46:02,105 --> 01:46:05,024
That she was nice out of pity,
but you ate it up.

1019
01:46:05,108 --> 01:46:06,734
That you were so gullible!

1020
01:46:06,985 --> 01:46:10,363
That naive servant's face...

1021
01:46:10,613 --> 01:46:12,906
Yes... you will love him.

1022
01:46:13,157 --> 01:46:16,451
If I say that I love someone else...

1023
01:46:17,495 --> 01:46:21,832
Me, who has no one on this earth...

1024
01:46:22,500 --> 01:46:24,877
Do you still want me to marry him?

1025
01:46:25,336 --> 01:46:26,170
Yes.

1026
01:46:38,016 --> 01:46:39,142
Miss!

1027
01:47:01,915 --> 01:47:04,792
I wish I'd never been born.

1028
01:47:17,555 --> 01:47:20,975
I wish I'd never been born.

1029
01:47:40,662 --> 01:47:41,704
Let go.

1030
01:47:44,415 --> 01:47:47,459
Miss, I'm sorry!

1031
01:47:50,004 --> 01:47:50,921
Let go!

1032
01:47:51,464 --> 01:47:53,466
I'm sorry, Miss!

1033
01:47:53,716 --> 01:47:55,467
Don't die.

1034
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:57,470
I'm sorry.

1035
01:47:59,472 --> 01:48:01,307
What are you sorry about?

1036
01:48:02,475 --> 01:48:06,975
I tried to trick you
into marrying that bastard.

1037
01:48:07,480 --> 01:48:11,442
I was going to put you
in a madhouse and run off.

1038
01:48:12,151 --> 01:48:16,155
Don't die.
Don't get married, Miss!

1039
01:48:18,324 --> 01:48:21,952
Sookee, are you worried about me?

1040
01:48:27,333 --> 01:48:29,001
I'm worried about you.

1041
01:48:34,507 --> 01:48:37,635
How do you know my name?

1042
01:48:38,511 --> 01:48:40,888
You think you're tricking me?

1043
01:48:43,307 --> 01:48:45,017
You're the one being tricked.

1044
01:48:46,310 --> 01:48:49,062
You're the one bound for the madhouse.

1045
01:48:50,857 --> 01:48:53,818
I was going to lock you up
in there under my name,

1046
01:48:53,901 --> 01:48:57,404
then I'd become you
and run far away, with him.

1047
01:49:02,035 --> 01:49:06,164
I won't say sorry,
since you tried to trick me too.

1048
01:49:12,962 --> 01:49:16,507
That fucking son of a bitch!

1049
01:49:17,633 --> 01:49:20,552
Oh, sorry Miss!

1050
01:49:20,636 --> 01:49:25,015
"I hope this letter finds you well.
This is Sookee.

1051
01:49:25,099 --> 01:49:29,144
I'm writing to inform you
of a change in plans.

1052
01:49:29,353 --> 01:49:33,853
I decided to team up
with the Lady Hideko.

1053
01:49:34,358 --> 01:49:37,486
As such, I'm now in need of all your help.

1054
01:49:37,570 --> 01:49:39,863
I'm enclosing an item as advance payment.”

1055
01:49:39,947 --> 01:49:44,447
Always remember the basement.

1056
01:49:58,925 --> 01:50:01,135
Do you want to go somewhere nice?

1057
01:50:32,959 --> 01:50:35,503
You didn't teach me to read Japanese.

1058
01:50:57,817 --> 01:51:00,194
Did that bastard draw this?

1059
01:51:02,321 --> 01:51:06,821
Is this what you've been reading
to that dirty old man

1060
01:51:07,827 --> 01:51:09,662
and those gentlemen?

1061
01:53:15,830 --> 01:53:18,040
The daughter of a legendary thief,

1062
01:53:18,124 --> 01:53:21,085
who sewed winter coats
out of stolen purses.

1063
01:53:21,502 --> 01:53:24,755
Herself a thief, pickpocket, swindler.

1064
01:53:25,798 --> 01:53:28,509
The saviour who came
to tear my life apart.

1065
01:53:28,884 --> 01:53:30,594
My Tamako.

1066
01:53:31,262 --> 01:53:32,846
My Sookee.

1067
01:54:24,023 --> 01:54:25,858
You scoundrel!

1068
01:54:25,941 --> 01:54:28,360
Let go of me, you filthy bitches!

1069
01:54:29,862 --> 01:54:30,904
Miss!

1070
01:54:31,864 --> 01:54:33,115
Let go!

1071
01:54:35,117 --> 01:54:36,743
Miss!

1072
01:54:51,592 --> 01:54:52,801
I'm hungry.

1073
01:54:54,303 --> 01:54:56,346
PART THREE

1074
01:54:57,348 --> 01:55:01,848
The first month,
I ordered a slim herringbone suit.

1075
01:55:02,561 --> 01:55:05,981
The next month,
I wore it to dine at the Imperial Hotel.

1076
01:55:06,524 --> 01:55:09,568
Me, a colonial boy working
as a tout at a brothel.

1077
01:55:09,652 --> 01:55:12,821
Some Englishmen who frequented the brothel
recognised me.

1078
01:55:12,905 --> 01:55:16,491
I thought they'd call the maitre d'
and kick me out,

1079
01:55:17,034 --> 01:55:18,410
but what do you know?

1080
01:55:19,078 --> 01:55:23,578
They were amused I'd spend a month's pay

1081
01:55:23,666 --> 01:55:25,167
on one dignified meal.

1082
01:55:26,043 --> 01:55:28,420
They started calling me "Count”

1083
01:55:28,504 --> 01:55:30,380
and taught me manners to go with the name.

1084
01:55:30,464 --> 01:55:32,841
Frankly, I'm not that
interested in money itself.

1085
01:55:32,925 --> 01:55:35,510
What I desire is, how shall I put it...

1086
01:55:36,512 --> 01:55:39,181
The manner of ordering wine
without looking at the price?

1087
01:55:39,265 --> 01:55:40,641
Something like that.

1088
01:55:52,570 --> 01:55:54,989
Fourteen hours by train from Vladivostok

1089
01:55:55,072 --> 01:55:57,532
is the summer home
of a genuine Russian noble family.

1090
01:55:59,452 --> 01:56:00,953
Shall we marry there?

1091
01:56:05,583 --> 01:56:07,835
In a few days,
I'll hear from the hospital.

1092
01:56:09,795 --> 01:56:12,881
That my wife Fujiwara Hideko has died.

1093
01:56:14,508 --> 01:56:19,008
You didn't just ask them to keep her?

1094
01:56:20,014 --> 01:56:23,600
I doubt Sookee would want
to live there very long.

1095
01:56:31,984 --> 01:56:33,819
Fuck!

1096
01:56:38,866 --> 01:56:40,826
I arranged it with a photography studio.

1097
01:56:40,910 --> 01:56:43,078
We'll replace this with your photograph.

1098
01:56:44,038 --> 01:56:47,875
From tomorrow,
we'll give Sookee a new life.

1099
01:56:48,459 --> 01:56:49,585
I'm glad.

1100
01:56:49,877 --> 01:56:51,837
Marry me once again.

1101
01:56:52,755 --> 01:56:54,339
This time as Nam Sookee.

1102
01:56:56,050 --> 01:56:58,469
You want another wedding night?

1103
01:57:04,558 --> 01:57:07,727
I think I like you... slightly.

1104
01:57:11,065 --> 01:57:13,609
Poor Sookee, in a place like that

1105
01:57:14,693 --> 01:57:16,736
all by herself...

1106
01:57:18,739 --> 01:57:21,742
Did such a thought ever cross your mind?

1107
01:57:22,159 --> 01:57:24,661
Not at all.
Why should I pity her?

1108
01:57:24,745 --> 01:57:27,998
Where I come from,
it's illegal to be naive.

1109
01:57:28,082 --> 01:57:31,668
Where you come from, it's not naive
to fall in love with a business partner?

1110
01:57:31,752 --> 01:57:33,754
Of course. It's illegal.

1111
01:57:34,255 --> 01:57:37,716
So even if my love for you
leads me to ruin,

1112
01:57:38,217 --> 01:57:39,801
don't pity me.

1113
01:57:40,469 --> 01:57:41,678
Love?

1114
01:57:43,764 --> 01:57:45,766
What does a crook know about love?

1115
01:58:09,790 --> 01:58:10,999
Fire!

1116
01:58:19,633 --> 01:58:23,553
C... c... come this way!

1117
01:58:23,637 --> 01:58:24,679
This way!

1118
01:59:31,330 --> 01:59:34,207
Because you desired me,

1119
01:59:34,291 --> 01:59:36,251
and overcame all obstacles to reach me,

1120
01:59:36,335 --> 01:59:38,795
I have been born anew, it's true.

1121
01:59:40,089 --> 01:59:41,882
I'm grateful for that.

1122
01:59:44,218 --> 01:59:46,220
I'll allow a kiss.

1123
01:59:51,141 --> 01:59:52,016
No.

1124
01:59:52,351 --> 01:59:53,393
Why not?

1125
01:59:56,563 --> 01:59:58,565
I don't like kisses with conditions.

1126
01:59:58,774 --> 02:00:01,610
I never learned how to stop halfway.

1127
02:00:03,570 --> 02:00:08,070
After this I'll thrust in deep,
to your navel.

1128
02:00:10,077 --> 02:00:11,745
Please do that.

1129
02:00:15,207 --> 02:00:17,292
Those aren't the eyes of one who wants it.

1130
02:00:17,376 --> 02:00:20,420
You know you can't deceive me
in such matters.

1131
02:00:25,134 --> 02:00:29,263
If I could be yours for ten minutes,

1132
02:00:29,346 --> 02:00:31,348
what would you give in exchange?

1133
02:00:31,974 --> 02:00:34,267
Whatever your heart desires.

1134
02:00:34,351 --> 02:00:37,354
Anything in this whole wide world.

1135
02:01:01,587 --> 02:01:03,880
There's much I want to teach you.

1136
02:01:05,090 --> 02:01:08,218
You'll become a completely new woman.

1137
02:02:59,705 --> 02:03:02,374
It won't hurt.
You know from those books?

1138
02:03:02,457 --> 02:03:06,335
In truth, women feel the greatest pleasure

1139
02:03:06,420 --> 02:03:08,380
when taken by force.

1140
02:03:08,714 --> 02:03:11,717
Now I'm going to rip your underwear.

1141
02:04:48,313 --> 02:04:50,732
Would you fetch those for me?

1142
02:05:35,027 --> 02:05:37,029
Respected Uncle,

1143
02:05:38,155 --> 02:05:42,655
It always pained me to see you straining

1144
02:05:43,035 --> 02:05:47,535
to speak flawless Japanese
before the Count from Nagoya,

1145
02:05:47,998 --> 02:05:51,084
and even to quiver your voice
like a nobleman.

1146
02:05:53,336 --> 02:05:57,836
So I'm happy to inform you
that you no longer need do so.

1147
02:06:00,719 --> 02:06:05,056
That man is the son of a Korean farmhand.

1148
02:06:06,058 --> 02:06:10,558
Oh, did my gift arrive safely?

1149
02:06:11,521 --> 02:06:14,899
Please tell this to my gift, in Korean.

1150
02:06:16,026 --> 02:06:17,819
I'm afraid that in real life,

1151
02:06:18,904 --> 02:06:22,407
no woman feels pleasure
at being taken by force.

1152
02:06:22,491 --> 02:06:26,991
But, for sending me Sookee
out of all the girls in the world,

1153
02:06:28,163 --> 02:06:30,582
I feel "slightly” grateful.

1154
02:06:43,845 --> 02:06:47,515
You wished to see my bookmaking tools?

1155
02:06:47,599 --> 02:06:51,561
Don't just look,
experience them for yourself.

1156
02:06:52,145 --> 02:06:54,522
I'll choose five books that I cherish...

1157
02:06:54,606 --> 02:06:57,567
that I used to cherish
more than anything.

1158
02:06:59,653 --> 02:07:00,570
Let's see...

1159
02:07:00,654 --> 02:07:01,613
First,

1160
02:07:04,866 --> 02:07:06,617
Confessions of a Whip

1161
02:07:15,836 --> 02:07:17,671
The Lizard Skin

1162
02:07:29,432 --> 02:07:32,435
Decadent Girls Who Sell Lingerie

1163
02:07:42,654 --> 02:07:45,490
May I please smoke a cigarette, sir?

1164
02:07:46,408 --> 02:07:47,367
Sir.

1165
02:07:50,162 --> 02:07:52,414
Bells and Balls

1166
02:07:55,834 --> 02:07:57,710
The Mortician's Bedroom

1167
02:08:10,015 --> 02:08:12,892
How could you let a little girl fool you?

1168
02:08:16,062 --> 02:08:20,191
But don't worry.
I'll catch them for you soon.

1169
02:08:22,694 --> 02:08:27,194
I arranged so that no two girls
travelling together can leave Kobe.

1170
02:08:34,414 --> 02:08:36,749
Please change the destination to Shanghai.

1171
02:08:36,833 --> 02:08:39,919
Changing two tickets,
from Vladivostok to Shanghai.

1172
02:08:40,003 --> 02:08:41,796
Yes, that's correct.

1173
02:08:42,547 --> 02:08:44,215
Show me your passports.

1174
02:08:51,264 --> 02:08:53,140
Miss Nam Sookee?

1175
02:08:56,061 --> 02:08:57,937
Mr. Go Pan-dol?

1176
02:09:06,112 --> 02:09:08,656
You need to pay an additional 3 yen.

1177
02:09:09,032 --> 02:09:10,033
All right.

1178
02:09:13,870 --> 02:09:18,370
I'm just an old man
who likes dirty stories.

1179
02:09:20,210 --> 02:09:24,422
Even listening to the same story,
people imagine different things.

1180
02:09:24,506 --> 02:09:27,800
Peering into each of those fantasies

1181
02:09:27,884 --> 02:09:30,928
was this old man's humble recreation.

1182
02:09:31,429 --> 02:09:34,473
What to do, now that it's all over?

1183
02:09:35,141 --> 02:09:37,476
You should at least tell me your story.

1184
02:09:39,396 --> 02:09:42,857
How did that bitch Hideko taste?

1185
02:09:43,608 --> 02:09:46,861
Was she fully ripe?
Tell me.

1186
02:09:49,572 --> 02:09:52,408
A cigarette might help my memory.

1187
02:09:52,951 --> 02:09:54,953
Right, right...

1188
02:09:56,162 --> 02:09:59,957
You have that silly penchant
for cigarettes?

1189
02:10:16,933 --> 02:10:20,895
So how was Hideko?

1190
02:10:26,943 --> 02:10:30,947
You have no windows here?

1191
02:10:34,534 --> 02:10:37,828
Sookee could be listening in.
Let's do our best.

1192
02:10:49,549 --> 02:10:51,300
That's it, good.

1193
02:11:02,896 --> 02:11:04,314
What's this?

1194
02:11:04,564 --> 02:11:06,816
You can't stop there, dear fellow.

1195
02:11:07,067 --> 02:11:09,694
So, where did you touch first?

1196
02:11:09,986 --> 02:11:11,278
Her face?

1197
02:11:13,740 --> 02:11:15,032
Her breasts?

1198
02:11:16,534 --> 02:11:19,036
Or straight for her
c... cunt?

1199
02:11:21,039 --> 02:11:22,540
Was it soft?

1200
02:11:23,375 --> 02:11:25,085
Did it tighten up?

1201
02:11:26,503 --> 02:11:28,630
Did it have many wrinkles?

1202
02:11:29,672 --> 02:11:31,548
Was it sufficiently wet?

1203
02:11:31,633 --> 02:11:34,969
The viscosity and transparency
of her vaginal secretion?

1204
02:11:36,638 --> 02:11:39,265
Please, one more cigarette, sir.

1205
02:12:05,750 --> 02:12:10,250
Spider thread pulled into strings...

1206
02:12:13,007 --> 02:12:17,507
I dare say no book has ever described

1207
02:12:18,346 --> 02:12:20,514
such a ferocious wedding night.

1208
02:12:23,226 --> 02:12:27,521
I thought I heard a nightingale sing.

1209
02:13:01,723 --> 02:13:06,223
And... the clear, bright crimson blood!

1210
02:13:15,862 --> 02:13:18,239
Thus the Lady became my wife.

1211
02:13:18,656 --> 02:13:22,326
Coy one moment, bold the next...

1212
02:13:26,289 --> 02:13:30,789
But how was she coy,

1213
02:13:31,044 --> 02:13:35,214
how was she bold, tell it to me in detail!

1214
02:13:35,840 --> 02:13:38,634
A story is all about the journey.

1215
02:13:39,177 --> 02:13:41,554
You should know.

1216
02:13:43,056 --> 02:13:44,766
Did she resist?

1217
02:13:45,892 --> 02:13:48,477
So did you pinch her ass as punishment?

1218
02:13:48,811 --> 02:13:52,689
Or did she spit at you in contempt?

1219
02:13:53,191 --> 02:13:54,859
Or else...

1220
02:13:55,568 --> 02:13:57,903
Did she beg you to do it?

1221
02:13:58,780 --> 02:14:02,116
Like the lady in
The Widow's Lapdog ?

1222
02:14:05,787 --> 02:14:07,038
How dare you!

1223
02:14:07,121 --> 02:14:09,081
Hideko is my wife.

1224
02:14:09,541 --> 02:14:14,041
What kind of scoundrel rattles on
about his wedding night!

1225
02:15:20,987 --> 02:15:22,029
It's odd...

1226
02:15:23,948 --> 02:15:25,532
Your smoke.

1227
02:15:28,286 --> 02:15:31,414
It's cold, blue...

1228
02:15:32,957 --> 02:15:37,457
and strangely beautiful.

1229
02:15:40,173 --> 02:15:44,673
You too have become soft, slow and dull.

1230
02:15:48,723 --> 02:15:51,892
Mercury is most deadly
in its gaseous state.

1231
02:15:52,644 --> 02:15:55,063
One cigarette would have sufficed.

1232
02:15:58,733 --> 02:16:03,112
At least I will die with my cock intact.

1233
02:20:03,477 --> 02:20:07,647
I hear a sound in the distance

1234
02:20:07,732 --> 02:20:11,944
that sounds like the steps of my love

1235
02:20:12,028 --> 02:20:16,198
An echo that makes my heart

1236
02:20:16,282 --> 02:20:19,618
skip a beat

1237
02:20:20,453 --> 02:20:24,874
But I wait all through the night

1238
02:20:24,957 --> 02:20:28,585
and my love never comes to me

1239
02:20:29,211 --> 02:20:33,423
There is no end to the heartache

1240
02:20:33,507 --> 02:20:37,177
that grips me in this hour

1241
02:20:37,720 --> 02:20:41,473
Waiting for the footsteps of

1242
02:20:41,974 --> 02:20:45,227
my dear love

1243
02:20:46,354 --> 02:20:50,149
Waiting for the footsteps of

1244
02:20:50,524 --> 02:20:54,319
my dear love

1245
02:21:12,004 --> 02:21:16,174
But then in my waiting heart

1246
02:21:16,258 --> 02:21:20,512
suddenly happiness overflows

1247
02:21:20,596 --> 02:21:24,766
There you are in the distance

1248
02:21:24,850 --> 02:21:28,645
coming to me

1249
02:21:29,146 --> 02:21:33,316
Filled with dreams of a new life

1250
02:21:33,401 --> 02:21:37,238
filled with happiness

1251
02:21:37,738 --> 02:21:41,533
Inside my waiting heart

1252
02:21:41,993 --> 02:21:45,746
flowers start to bloom

1253
02:21:46,288 --> 02:21:50,083
Come my lover, come to me

1254
02:21:50,543 --> 02:21:54,046
I missed you so

1255
02:21:54,880 --> 02:21:58,466
Let's dream of happy times

1256
02:21:59,135 --> 02:22:03,305
like long ago

1257
02:22:20,531 --> 02:22:24,701
Filled with dreams of a new life

1258
02:22:24,785 --> 02:22:28,622
filled with happiness

1259
02:22:29,123 --> 02:22:32,918
Inside my waiting heart

1260
02:22:33,377 --> 02:22:37,130
flowers start to bloom

1261
02:22:37,673 --> 02:22:41,468
Waiting for the footsteps of

1262
02:22:41,927 --> 02:22:45,430
my dear love

1263
02:22:46,265 --> 02:22:49,851
Waiting for the footsteps of

1264
02:22:50,519 --> 02:22:54,689
my dear love
