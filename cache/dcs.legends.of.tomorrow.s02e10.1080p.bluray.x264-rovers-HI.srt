But don't worry.

I'll start you off with an easy question.

163
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:33,419
Right eye or left eye?

164
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,214
Please. Please. Don't. I'll do anything!

165

I'll tell you anything you want to know
even if I don't know.

Second question,

00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,720
when was the last time
you had any dental work done?

Captain Hunter is British.

173
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:02,274
You pulled out his tooth.

isn't that kind of bush league?

00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,294
From a security deposit box
in Switzerland.

180
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,425
Who puts that kind of information
on a tooth?

181
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,507
A Time Master.
That's no ordinary security box.

182
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,176
My thinking exactly.

183
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,596
Now, it's possible the box could contain
his son's birth certificate and the like.

I'm sure Gideon would have detected them.

If none of you would reveal to her
that she's an Aberration.

Why are you looking at me?

on identifying the speedster?

I think the technical term is "nowhere".

are either dead or his friends.

Or people he thought were his friends,
and are now dead.

And in the meantime,
you and Lily keep working with the amulet

to figure out where
the rest of the Spear is.

even after we've gotten
his precious Spear?

Oh, forget it. Why am I asking you?

I don't know, man. I don't know anything.

295
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:51,502
I don't even know why you're getting me
to wear this... This... This...

296
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,711
This monkey suit.

297
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:55,423
- And my mouth is so sore...
- Quit whining.

298
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,969
Fact of the matter
is we have something in common, Rip.

299
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:02,096

- Whatever.

We are both dealing
with unstable individuals.

301
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,058
And that is not something I enjoy.

302

Hey, this is not exactly
a walk in the park for me either.

Which is why

304
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,819
you will do exactly as I say.

305
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,526
Then maybe, just maybe,

306
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:21,828
you'll make it through this alive.

Cool. All right. Um...

308

To do?

have you ever been to Switzerland?

You go to the bank associate

you want to access security box 4587.

Bring the contents of said box back to us.

334

It's strange how he never stays
in one place for very long.

That he wanted to kill one of us?

340
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,504
No. That he didn't know
why he was relying on us.

341
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,543
I mean, fair question.

back in 2016.

347

I am not trying...

350
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:15,646
A trio such as ours
turning one against each other

351
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:18,436
for your own benefit
is not only obvious but cliché.

352
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,109
Thawne does not treat us as equals to him.

353
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:24,074
And until he does,
neither of us is getting what he wants.

Whoever this speedster is,

359

it's someone you and your friends
haven't encountered before.

360
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:42,301
Which means this speedster
is from the future which makes sense

361
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,007
because speedsters can time travel.

362
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:46,681
Then what would the speedster
need the Spear of Destiny for?

He could just go back
and change history himself.

But not reality.
That's why he needs the Spear.

365

what is this speedster trying to change?

(MALCOLM SIGHS)

476
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,334
Perhaps we could all just talk about

477
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:12,714
- what went wrong.
- Shh.

478
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:15,543
Oh, I know what went wrong.
I listened to him.

If you'd have listened to me,

instead of being chased out.</i>

Either way, we came out empty-handed.

482

I seem to remember Eobard mentioning
how he was going to punish your failure.

If anyone's a failure, it's you.

You were the one who learned
about Hunter's secret account,

00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,982
yet seemed not to know about a passcode.

No wonder they passed you over for Ra's.

that he was Ra's al Ghul.

In this future that you're from,
do I at least have two hands?

495

Either way, I intend to change my future,

496
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:03,720
but look at you now. You're pathetic.

497

I don't even know why Thawne recruited you
in the first place.

Mmm-hmm.

Now...

I suggest you choose a blade
that matches that sharp tongue of yours.

An Aberration is an unnatural alteration
of history as a result of time travel.

Am I an Aberration?

That word could never describe who you are
or how much you mean to me.

- So it's true.
- Please let me explain.

519
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:15,204
That's why you were acting so weird

520
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:17,957
when you visited Central City
the first time.

521
00:24:18,374 --> 00:24:20,627
The reason you were treating me
like a stranger...

522
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:22,340
Was because you didn't even exist

523
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:25,632
the last time I boarded this ship
and left 2016.

524
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:28,551
But now you do exist.
And that's all that matters.

525
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:29,809
(SOBS) How could this be happening?

526
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:32,013
Well, it's really quite simple.

527
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:36,897
You see, I interacted
with my younger self back in 1987,

528
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:40,063
who then interacted
with your mother's former self,

529
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:43,574
and when two former selves
love each other...

530
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,860
Okay, Dad, we've already had
the birds-and-bees talk.

531
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:47,152
I was 10.

Or did we?

533
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,994
That's a very interesting point.

534
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:54,251
I mean, who's to say
which of our realities is real

535
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,663
and which one is aberrant?

536
00:24:56,829 --> 00:25:00,083
It's really a matter of perspective.
Actually, it's quite fascinating...

This is not fascinating, Dad!

- Sorry, this is quite urgent.

628

Look, what if instead of creating a person
like you did with Lily,

629
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:58,634
our mystery speedster
erased himself from history?

630
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:00,974
- Why would he want to do that?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

631
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:04,603
But it would explain why we don't have
any evidence of his existence.

632
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,439
Okay, so we just need to ID
someone who doesn't exist.

00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:09,979
Eobard Thawne.

634
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:13,191
- Um, is... Is he okay?
- I'm fine.

635
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:17,574
Eobard Thawne is a name.
The name of a speedster who...

636

Who what?

from existence when his progenitor,</i>

638
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:27,543
<i>Eddie Thawne, committed suicide
in order to stop him.</i>

639
00:30:28,410 --> 00:30:31,380
Which would explain why the Time Masters
didn't have a file on him.

640
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,253
But if Thawne doesn't exist then how...

641
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,167
He was protected from his ancestor's death

642
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:37,257
because he was a member
of the Speed Force.

why a seemingly invincible speedster

By all means, Dr. Heywood,
please enlighten us.

00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:40,709
Okay, what if Thawne
isn't just chasing us?

681

What if he's running from something?

But running from what?

683
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:47,474
- Time.
- And time takes time to harden.

684
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:51,887
And if Thawne ceased to exist the moment
his great-great whatever killed himself,

685
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:54,055
then maybe he has to keep moving

686
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:57,852

not to catch up with him.

Per the scientific method,
there's only one way to prove it.

00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:19,598
Well, considering he never wanted
to be my father,

784
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:23,059
that should draw his parental dictates
into question, wouldn't it?

785
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,895
You share my fondness for erudition.
(CHUCKLES)

786
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,895
You truly are my daughter.

787
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:33,437
Well, I am sorry about that.

788
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:36,026
No, I'm... I'm the one who's sorry.

789
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:38,358
(SCOFFS) For what?

790
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,027
It's not your fault I'm a mistake.

791
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:43,204
I've made many mistakes in my life, Lily,

792
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:46,958
but you most certainly
are not one of them.

793
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:51,209
The apology that I owe you
is for not telling you

794
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:54,215
about the unique circumstances
of your conception.

795
00:38:55,083 --> 00:38:57,586
You didn't want me to know
that you didn't want me.

796
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:01,422
No.

- You're right, I...

798

I didn't want children.

799

But if there's one thing my travels
aboard the <i>Waverider</i> have taught me,

800
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:17,151
it's that time often doesn't provide us
with what we want.

801
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:20,988
But it's quite adept
at giving us what we need.

802
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:26,748
And I needed you in my life.

803
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:33,622
In ways that I could
never even dare to imagine.

(LILY CHUCKLES)

I just don't want there to be
any more secrets between us.

806
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,935
Well, in that spirit,
I suppose I should tell you

807
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:53,476
that I am one-half of a nuclear-powered
superhero called Firestorm.

811
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:04,320
Anyway, as fun as this was,

812
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:07,656
I probably should be getting home.

813
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,200
You're sure you can't stay?

814
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,164
I... I would, I just...

815
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:15,297
I'm working on a series
of synthetic proteins

816
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:17,833
that are not going to
fold themselves, so...

817
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:21,173
So, then I guess this is goodbye.

819
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,678
Good luck folding those proteins.

This, uh, techno-crap,
as you so eloquently put it,

825
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,505
is Captain Hunter's memories.

826
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:08,892
Including the locations
of the other pieces of the Spear, I hope.

827

That is my working assumption, yes.

828
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:14,431
All we have to do now is upload
his memories to his cerebral cortex.

829
00:41:15,056 --> 00:41:17,229
And that's not happening now because...

830
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:20,646
Well, we'd hardly be doing
Captain Hunter any favors

831
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:23,235
if we just restored the memories
without taking the liberty

832
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:25,150
to redress some of his shortcomings.

833
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,952
