1
00:00:57,142 --> 00:00:59,436
All right, we're good to go.

2
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:02,313
- You got this?
- You bet your ass, bubba.

3
00:01:02,856 --> 00:01:04,816
Let's make some money!

4
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:12,198
Everyone in position.

5
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:16,870
I thought we'd be robbing banks by now,

6
00:01:16,995 --> 00:01:19,330
not some gas truck in the middle of nowhere.

7
00:01:19,414 --> 00:01:22,083
Down here, gas is gold, bubba.

8
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:24,043


9
00:01:25,253 --> 00:01:26,296


10
00:01:26,379 --> 00:01:28,047


11
00:01:29,716 --> 00:01:30,759


12
00:01:30,842 --> 00:01:32,844
<i>Kill the chatter! Game time</i>

13
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:35,263
I wouldn't piss him off, guys.

14
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:50,612


15
00:01:50,695 --> 00:01:52,405


16
00:01:56,242 --> 00:01:58,161
Okay, guys, we're gonna
have to hit this hard and fast.

17
00:01:58,244 --> 00:02:01,080
<i>We got four k left before the downgrade.</i>

18
00:02:05,293 --> 00:02:06,795


19
00:02:22,227 --> 00:02:24,062
Locked and loaded!

20
00:02:32,445 --> 00:02:34,155


21
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,242


22
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,577


23
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:44,415


24
00:02:48,253 --> 00:02:49,754


25
00:02:49,838 --> 00:02:51,923
This is all you, Han.

26
00:02:57,345 --> 00:02:59,013
Liquid gold.

27
00:02:59,264 --> 00:03:00,640


28
00:03:06,312 --> 00:03:07,355
We're clear.

29
00:03:07,438 --> 00:03:08,606
Okay, T, you're up-

30
00:03:12,652 --> 00:03:15,697
Let's see if you can get it
under six tries this time, huh, T?

31
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,825


32
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:22,078
It's more like three.
Come on, Tego, keep it real.

33
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,830


34
00:03:32,547 --> 00:03:34,132


35
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:42,265
Just one K left. We're running out of road.
Get in there, brother.

36
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:44,142
I got it, I got it.

37
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:49,314


38
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,149


39
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,569
Shit!

40
00:03:55,528 --> 00:03:56,905


41
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:02,702
T, cut loose! Unhitch, unhitch!

42
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,331


43
00:04:07,665 --> 00:04:09,000


44
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:27,352


45
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:34,651


46
00:04:40,907 --> 00:04:42,533


47
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,960
- Spray that hitch!
- I don't have a hammer!

48
00:04:52,043 --> 00:04:53,544
Just do it!

49
00:05:03,388 --> 00:05:04,389


50
00:05:08,226 --> 00:05:09,560
Hold on! Hold on!

51
00:05:09,686 --> 00:05:11,187
No shit!

52
00:05:13,398 --> 00:05:15,525
Hold onto something tight!

53
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:29,414


54
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:40,675
Letty!

55
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:43,011
- Give me your hand!
- I can't reach!

56
00:05:43,094 --> 00:05:44,762
You got to jump!

57
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:56,399


58
00:05:59,652 --> 00:06:01,446


59
00:06:10,997 --> 00:06:12,165
Jump!

60
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,168
Letty, jump!

61
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:21,299
I've got you!

62
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:29,474


63
00:06:54,457 --> 00:06:55,708
Dom...

64
00:06:58,127 --> 00:06:59,295
Dom?

65
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,509
Dom!

66
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:35,206


67
00:07:46,926 --> 00:07:48,553


68
00:07:48,678 --> 00:07:49,887


69
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:11,576


70
00:08:13,703 --> 00:08:15,204


71
00:08:15,288 --> 00:08:16,873
How you doing?

72
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,126
Money, money!

73
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,628
Good.

74
00:08:25,256 --> 00:08:27,175
Yo, why your stack is bigger than mine always?

75
00:08:27,258 --> 00:08:29,093
I'm supersized, baby.

76
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:32,263


77
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:41,731
Cops just raided our garage in Baracoa.

78
00:08:42,565 --> 00:08:45,067
They were real interested in you.

79
00:08:45,693 --> 00:08:50,448
Heat's on and we just sent up a flare
that's gonna lead them right to us.

80
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,576
I say we move out first thing in the morning.

81
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:57,038
Nah, it's me they want.

82
00:08:57,622 --> 00:08:59,624
And if they catch me,

83
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:02,710
they're throwing big numbers at anybody with me.

84
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,798
Han, we had a good run.

85
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,595
Time for you to go do your own thing.

86
00:09:16,474 --> 00:09:19,477
Heard they're doing some crazy shit in Tokyo.

87
00:09:25,775 --> 00:09:27,735
Have you seen Letty?

88
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:42,124
There she is.

89
00:09:45,253 --> 00:09:46,420


90
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:50,800
I hear Rio is nice this time of year.

91
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:56,764
The cops are getting hungrier.

92
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:59,267
Then I guess we're doing our job.

93
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,982
I'm a walking target.

94
00:10:06,524 --> 00:10:09,819
I don't want you around when they catch up to me.

95
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:14,448
"Ride or die," remember?

96
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,536
Dom, how long have we been doing this?

97
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,375
And now all of a sudden,
out of nowhere, it's too dangerous?

98
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:26,544
Come on.

99
00:10:31,549 --> 00:10:34,635
We'll figure it out. We always do.

100
00:11:46,457 --> 00:11:48,292


101
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,545


102
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,632


103
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:56,926


104
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,848


105
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,433


106
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,354


107
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:53,107


108
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:04,827


109
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,245


110
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:15,296


111
00:13:21,927 --> 00:13:23,345


112
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:31,937


113
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:58,255


114
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,634


115
00:14:01,717 --> 00:14:02,885
- I don't know shit!
- Give me a name!

116
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:05,054
- I don't know shit, man!
- Give me a name!

117
00:14:05,137 --> 00:14:08,140
David Park! David Park's the guy you want!

118
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:09,850
Please!

119
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:20,861
Thank God. Listen, he's in a mood
because yesterday was his cheat day,

120
00:14:20,945 --> 00:14:22,863
and then today, some genius brought in donuts.

121
00:14:22,947 --> 00:14:24,198
Great.

122
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,117
Sorry I'm late.

123
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,327


124
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:32,748
Complaints keep rolling in after
your little downtown Olympics, O'Conner.

125
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:36,001
Tell me that reinstating you wasn't a mistake.

126
00:14:36,085 --> 00:14:39,255
- I got a name. David Park.
- That's it?

127
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:41,757
That's all you got? David Park?

128
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,718
I could throw a fortune cookie out this
window and hit 50 David Parks right now.

129
00:14:44,802 --> 00:14:47,471
- It's Korean, not Chinese.
- Whatever.

130
00:14:48,097 --> 00:14:52,685
Park is a scout that recruits street racers
to be mules for the Braga cartel.

131
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:55,354
We find Park, and we bust the bad guys.

132
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,157


133
00:15:08,826 --> 00:15:11,036


134
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:20,296


135
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:21,714
<i>Dom.</i>

136
00:15:21,797 --> 00:15:24,425
Mia, I told you not to call me here.

137
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,635
<i>Dom, it's Letty.</i>

138
00:15:27,595 --> 00:15:29,430
<i>She's been murdered.</i>

139
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:49,617
We have gathered here to pay
our final respects to...

140
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,870
Let us reflect on her journey

141
00:15:56,582 --> 00:16:01,295
"The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want. He makes me lie down..."

142
00:16:03,464 --> 00:16:04,965


143
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:23,942
Facial recognition software matched Toretto

144
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:25,861
about ten minutes after he crossed the border.

145
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,449
I don't get it.

146
00:16:30,658 --> 00:16:32,576
I thought he'd show.

147
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:30,134
I told you not to come.
They're staking the place out.

148
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:32,636
- If they find you...
- They won't.

149
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:38,642
Come on. Look at you.

150
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,379
Letty wouldn't let them junk it.

151
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:11,550
Even though it is a goddamn curse.

152
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:17,306
When she came back, she was always in here,

153
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:20,851
working on it day and night.

154
00:18:26,482 --> 00:18:28,108
It was weird.

155
00:18:29,735 --> 00:18:32,696
It was like she knew you were coming back.

156
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,075
I want to see the crash site.

157
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:46,168
I just got off the phone
with Deputy Director Lawson.

158
00:18:46,877 --> 00:18:50,297
If we don't make serious inroads into
the Braga case in the next 72 hours,

159
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,633
they're gonna shut us down.

160
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,386
I know I'm a newbie here, but why the clock now?

161
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,971
Because it's been two years,

162
00:18:58,055 --> 00:19:03,268
and the last three agents we sent to infiltrate
his organization came back in body bags.

163
00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:07,940
He's moved more heroin across
the border than Escobar did in ten years.

164
00:19:08,023 --> 00:19:10,859
This guy is becoming
one of our biggest national threats,

165
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:12,986
and we don't even have a picture of him.

166
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:16,573
We don't have prints! Not even a goddamn DOB!

167
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:21,829
What's the status on David Park?

168
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:24,122
Isn't he our ticket into the Braga organization?

169
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:28,001
We're running the name through city and
county databases, sorting the possibilities.

170
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:30,003
We've got over five hundred already.

171
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:33,131
Park's insignificant.
Sounds like another jerk-off to me. 

172
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:37,219
It's not. Without Park, Braga wouldn't
have drivers to move his shipments.

173
00:19:37,302 --> 00:19:40,055
Cross-check traffic. Illegal modifications.

174
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:44,434
Street racing. This guy will definitely
have a record. We'll find him.

175
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:46,728
We better.

176
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:47,980


177
00:19:48,063 --> 00:19:49,106
What do you know?

178
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:52,818
Your boy Toretto's red Chevelle
has been spotted in his old neighborhood.

179
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,736
I'm going to bring his ass in.

180
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,030
Not in your car you're not.

181
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:07,666
It's straight ahead.

182
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:31,982


183
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,848


184
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:08,393


185
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:36,546


186
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,223


187
00:21:54,648 --> 00:21:55,691


188
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:15,752
You found something back there.

189
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:23,260
There were burn marks on the ground.

190
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:29,599
The kind that could
only be caused by nitrometh.

191
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:36,606
There's only one guy
in all of L.A. that sells that.

192
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:43,822
Nothing you can do
is gonna bring her back, Dom.

193
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:48,243
If I were Letty, I would ask you...

194
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:51,872
No, I would beg you, please, let this go.

195
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,125
Before it's too late.

196
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:01,548
It's already too late.

197
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:08,513
I love you.

198
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:23,403


199
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,413


200
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:16,998
Miss Toretto.

201
00:24:17,916 --> 00:24:20,252
I'm Michael Stasiak, FBI.

202
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:23,380
Let's you and I have a little chat.

203
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:30,595


204
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,737
Hi. This is Forsythe in Evidence.

205
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,449
I need Stasiak down here right away
to sign some greenies.

206
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:53,076
Thanks.

207
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,703
- Hi.
- Hey.

208
00:24:54,786 --> 00:24:57,330
Okay, I narrowed it down
to fifty or so David Parks.

209
00:24:57,414 --> 00:24:59,791
What I'd like you to do is run
the make and model on each one of them.

210
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:00,917
- All right?
- Okay. All right.

211
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,210
Thank you.

212
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:11,595


213
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:15,140
Hey, Tyler, we got a transfer.

214
00:25:17,309 --> 00:25:19,311
You want to come with me?

215
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:23,315


216
00:25:40,749 --> 00:25:42,000
Toretto.

217
00:25:43,335 --> 00:25:44,878
When'd you get back in town?

218
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,839
I'm looking for a car you did an engine mod on.

219
00:25:47,923 --> 00:25:52,427
Nitromethane tank.
Ford full-size. Continental tires.

220
00:25:54,346 --> 00:25:57,682
Look, what are you doing,
coming in here like this, huh?

221
00:25:58,225 --> 00:26:00,894
This ain't your scene any more, boss.

222
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:03,688
Don't ever put your hands on me again, okay?

223
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:06,107
Say hi to your sister for me.

224
00:26:09,653 --> 00:26:11,154


225
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:17,077


226
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:20,997
A Korean kid brought it in. David Park.

227
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,167
It's a green Ford Torino.

228
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,545
Please don't drop this on me!

229
00:26:32,384 --> 00:26:34,094
I'm almost done.

230
00:26:36,388 --> 00:26:39,849
Why don't you tell me
why you dragged me here, Brian?

231
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:49,901
You know they're
going to capture Dom. Maybe worse.

232
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:55,865
I don't want you getting tangled up in this.
So stay away from him.

233
00:26:56,783 --> 00:27:00,161
That's what you
have to say to me after five years?

234
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:04,416
All of a sudden, you care what happens to me.

235
00:27:07,752 --> 00:27:10,171
What I did to you was wrong.

236
00:27:10,255 --> 00:27:14,509
I'm sorry. It was...
It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.

237
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:17,929
I'm sorry, too, Brian.

238
00:27:18,513 --> 00:27:23,268
I'm so sorry that you had to come into
my home and pretend to love me.

239
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:28,732
I'm so sorry that you ripped my family apart.
I'm very sorry that that was hard for you.

240
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:34,070
I lied to you.

241
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:38,116
I lied to Dom. I lied to everybody.

242
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:41,828
That's what I do best.
It's why the Feds recruited me.

243
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:45,874
Maybe you're lying to yourself.

244
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:50,837
Maybe you're not the good guy
pretending to be a bad guy.

245
00:27:51,296 --> 00:27:54,716
Maybe you're the bad guy
pretending to be the good guy.

246
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,926
You ever think about that?

247
00:27:58,553 --> 00:28:00,055
Every day-

248
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:14,277
I always wondered,

249
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:19,366
why did you let my brother go that day?

250
00:28:20,867 --> 00:28:22,369
I don't know.

251
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:33,630
Shit.

252
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,801
Brian!

253
00:28:37,926 --> 00:28:40,887
I got the cross-checks on David Park
back and have a list of possibles.

254
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,390
- What do you got?
- All right. A 45-year-old male in a '06 Scion

255
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:45,558
- with three reckless driving tickets.
- No.

256
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:48,019
- An '01 Chevy Tahoe.
- No.

257
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:51,981
Two Mini Coopers,
a '06 and a '07, a Toyota hybrid.

258
00:28:52,107 --> 00:28:54,692
- Hell no.
- A '98 Saturn, a '95 Sebring.

259
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:59,030
- A '98 Nissan 240 with an illegal mod.
- Wait. That's it.

260
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:01,658
- What?
- The 240 with the illegal mod.

261
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:04,994
- How do you know?
- 'Cause that's something I'd drive.

262
00:29:29,394 --> 00:29:30,854
Don't! Don't! Don't!

263
00:29:42,532 --> 00:29:45,243
Green Torino, running nitro.

264
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:47,871
- Whose car?
- I don't know, man.

265
00:29:47,996 --> 00:29:50,915
I'm just the middleman.
I swear! I'm just the middleman!

266
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:52,834


267
00:29:55,753 --> 00:29:57,505
Wait, wait, Wait.

268
00:29:58,089 --> 00:30:01,885
I don't know shit, man. I swear.
I just run cars for Braga, all right?

269
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:04,762
All I can do is get you in the race!
That's all I can do!

270
00:30:04,888 --> 00:30:06,222
What race?

271
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:09,851


272
00:30:11,686 --> 00:30:13,438
Help! Come on, hold on!

273
00:30:13,563 --> 00:30:15,899
Let me up, man! Come on!

274
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:29,871
Come on, man,
I don't know shit! Just let me up!

275
00:30:29,954 --> 00:30:32,123
I told you, you got to talk to Braga!

276
00:30:32,248 --> 00:30:33,249
Bring him up, Dom.

277
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:36,085
God! Don't drop me! That's all I know!

278
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:38,546
Bring him up.

279
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:41,132
You here to take me in, O'Conner?

280
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:44,135
- Shit! Shit!
- Shut up!

281
00:30:47,055 --> 00:30:50,433
- Letty was my friend, too.
- You weren't anyone's friend.

282
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:53,645
Yo, can you guys talk about this later?
Now pull my ass up!

283
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:56,022
She was running for this guy,
Braga, and things went bad.

284
00:30:56,105 --> 00:30:57,148
Please!

285
00:30:57,273 --> 00:30:59,859
I'm going to get these guys, Dom.

286
00:30:59,943 --> 00:31:02,153
Now let me do my job and bring him up.

287
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:04,739
I'm going to kill this Braga.

288
00:31:06,616 --> 00:31:07,825
God!

289
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:10,995
And anyone else who gets in my way.

290
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,459
Hey!

291
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:18,670
Don't let go.

292
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:28,846
O'Conner!

293
00:31:30,598 --> 00:31:34,269
O'Conner! If you ever
release a witness of mine again...

294
00:31:35,186 --> 00:31:36,312


295
00:31:38,648 --> 00:31:40,567
- That's enough!
- Don't touch me.

296
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:42,068
- I'm fine!
- That's enough.

297
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:45,363
- You're through, O'Conner!
- I said that's enough!

298
00:31:46,864 --> 00:31:48,408
Stasiak, go get yourself cleaned up.

299
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,743
What? He hit me first! You...

300
00:31:50,827 --> 00:31:52,829
This isn't the Cub Scouts!

301
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:56,165
Now, go on! You're bleeding on my floor.

302
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,595
O'Conner, do you know the difference
between a cop and a criminal?

303
00:32:08,678 --> 00:32:11,139
- What?
- One bad judgment call.

304
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,809
Keep your shit in line, son.

305
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,481
Have a good time.

306
00:32:23,484 --> 00:32:25,153
Take a seat.

307
00:32:29,073 --> 00:32:33,703
Good news. We have intel that
Braga's number two, Ramon Campos,

308
00:32:33,828 --> 00:32:35,955
will hold a street race
in Koreatown tomorrow night

309
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:38,207
to fill a slot on his team.

310
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:41,419
They've already chosen
three drivers from previous races.

311
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:47,884
Our newest informant, Mr. David Park,
has been kind enough to get us into the race.

312
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:52,597
O'Conner, you're up.

313
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:56,017
Let me guess, winner gets the slot.

314
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:01,064


315
00:33:01,564 --> 00:33:04,317
All right, so these are
all the imports the city has in impound.

316
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,527
- Okay, nice.
- Pick your poison.

317
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:09,822
All right, 2206. I crashed one of those.

318
00:33:09,906 --> 00:33:14,577
3418 and 2765.

319
00:33:15,912 --> 00:33:17,872
Okay, so which one do you want?

320
00:33:17,955 --> 00:33:19,707
I want them all.

321
00:33:49,654 --> 00:33:51,447
Standard issue tracking device.

322
00:33:51,572 --> 00:33:53,449
Boss wants to know
where you are at all times.

323
00:33:54,283 --> 00:33:55,326


324
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:24,188


325
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,163


326
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,170
You want to play with it?

327
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,297
Hey!

328
00:34:49,672 --> 00:34:51,007
What are you looking at, nutsack?

329
00:34:51,132 --> 00:34:52,175


330
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,926
I don't know. You tell me.

331
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:59,307
The racer wants what Dwight's got. See,
but, ladies, Dwight's already on the team.

332
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:01,350
You got to be fast
if you want to drive for Braga.

333
00:35:01,434 --> 00:35:04,270
- Is there a problem here?
- No.

334
00:35:06,773 --> 00:35:10,193
- You one of Park's guys, blondie?
- Yeah. Yeah, I am.

335
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,570
Follow me.

336
00:35:15,907 --> 00:35:17,700
See you later, punk.

337
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:19,702
You, too, punk.

338
00:35:32,048 --> 00:35:34,217
Bull's-eye, <i>coňo,</i> come on!

339
00:35:39,222 --> 00:35:40,223


340
00:35:40,306 --> 00:35:41,474
We can do this all day.

341
00:35:41,557 --> 00:35:43,059


342
00:35:46,646 --> 00:35:48,981
You all know why you're here.

343
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:51,150
Good drivers

344
00:35:52,819 --> 00:35:54,654
are a dime a dozen.

345
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:59,325
Man, every corner's got
a chingadera tuner racing for pinks.

346
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:03,162
That's not what Braga has got me looking for.

347
00:36:03,788 --> 00:36:08,459
Braga wants someone that would sell
their abuelita to be behind the wheel.

348
00:36:10,002 --> 00:36:14,131
Someone that drives their
ten-second cars not in a straight line,

349
00:36:14,257 --> 00:36:18,427
but to push it and make it
through places no one else would take it.

350
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:20,763
Real drivers.

351
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:24,934
So, what are we hauling?

352
00:36:25,935 --> 00:36:29,355
For the money Braga's paying,
you don't need to know.

353
00:36:29,438 --> 00:36:32,108
You just said you wanted real drivers.

354
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:37,280
A real driver knows exactly what's in his car.

355
00:36:39,198 --> 00:36:40,616


356
00:36:42,326 --> 00:36:44,120
Mira, real driver,

357
00:36:45,997 --> 00:36:48,207
nobody's forcing you to race.

358
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:50,042
You the boss?

359
00:36:51,794 --> 00:36:54,130
Or am I talking to the boss?

360
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:58,968
Do I look like a boss?

361
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:04,765
My job is to find the best drivers, period.

362
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:08,477
Whoever wins the race gets the info. We cool?

363
00:37:13,399 --> 00:37:14,984
Are we cool?

364
00:37:17,153 --> 00:37:18,821
Yeah, we're cool.

365
00:37:19,322 --> 00:37:21,324
No, we ain't cool, man.

366
00:37:22,033 --> 00:37:24,201
Who's closing these streets?

367
00:37:24,744 --> 00:37:26,412


368
00:37:26,495 --> 00:37:28,581
No one. That's the point.

369
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:33,586


370
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:43,721

- You sure you want to do this?
- A lot has changed.

378
00:38:09,372 --> 00:38:11,207
You're right.

How's my ass look, Chia Pet?

388
00:39:06,429 --> 00:39:07,972
Ghetto Smurf.

389
00:39:11,475 --> 00:39:13,144

Dead man driving.

393
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,712

00:39:41,005 --> 00:39:42,798

Shit!

397
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,533
Damn.

00:40:09,658 --> 00:40:10,993

00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:50,616
- <i>Rerouting.</i>

<i>You are 2.6 miles from destination.</i>

<i>You are now 4.2 miles from your destination.</i>

Yeah, guess who's back, Dom?

415
00:42:06,859 --> 00:42:08,194
Let's go!

416
00:42:12,656 --> 00:42:14,283
Nice car, baby!

417
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:33,928


418
00:42:40,267 --> 00:42:41,352


419
00:42:58,953 --> 00:43:00,162
Bitch!

420
00:43:01,497 --> 00:43:04,583
<i>You are now one-quarter mile

421

422
00:43:23,227 --> 00:43:24,853
Too early, Dom.

423
00:43:27,898 --> 00:43:28,941


424
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,124
No!

425
00:43:45,708 --> 00:43:47,501
Still a buster.

426
00:43:49,586 --> 00:43:50,838


427
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,049
<i>You have reached your destination. Goodbye.</i>

428
00:44:06,228 --> 00:44:09,106
At least we know you can't beat me straight up.

429
00:44:09,189 --> 00:44:11,025
I didn't know there were any rules.

430
00:44:11,108 --> 00:44:12,860


431
00:44:12,943 --> 00:44:16,113
- Now that's what I call real driving.
- No, that's bullshit, man!

432
00:44:16,196 --> 00:44:18,157
Go cry to your mama, eh?

433
00:44:20,576 --> 00:44:22,578
You work for Braga now.

434
00:44:22,995 --> 00:44:25,789
When the GPS calls, you follow.

435
00:44:30,794 --> 00:44:32,588
Driver's license.

436
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:36,091
- What driver's license?
- Thumb.

437
00:44:42,014 --> 00:44:43,807
Cell phone number.

438
00:44:48,896 --> 00:44:51,106
The print is for Campos.

439
00:44:51,774 --> 00:44:53,650
The number is for me.

440
00:44:57,112 --> 00:44:58,489
Yo, nutsack!

441
00:44:58,572 --> 00:45:02,159
Let me tell you something, man,
muscle beats import every time.

442
00:45:02,242 --> 00:45:05,037
You know what I'm saying? Every time!

443
00:45:05,913 --> 00:45:08,957
Ladies, let's get on back to Papa Dwight's.

444
00:45:15,589 --> 00:45:18,634
Papa Dwight wants you to take off your shoes.

445
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:22,262
Dwight likes feet. Take off your shoes.

446
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:24,765
So beautiful.

447
00:45:24,848 --> 00:45:26,058


448
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:28,852
Dwight likes this foot a lot.

449
00:45:37,152 --> 00:45:38,570
Yes, baby!

450
00:45:39,738 --> 00:45:41,198
- Daddy Dwight loves...
- FBI!

451
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,324


452
00:45:42,408 --> 00:45:43,742
Hey! Yo, what are you doing?

453
00:45:43,826 --> 00:45:46,954
I didn't do nothing, man!
Dwight didn't do nothing!

454
00:45:47,037 --> 00:45:49,498
- Hey, no! Stay, stay! Where you going?
- Bye, Dwight!

455
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,791
No, what did I do?

456
00:45:50,874 --> 00:45:51,959


457
00:45:52,042 --> 00:45:54,044
You're under arrest for distribution of meth.

458
00:45:54,128 --> 00:45:57,506
Meth? Dwight's never touched that shit, bro!

459
00:45:57,589 --> 00:45:58,632
Dwight has now.

460
00:45:58,715 --> 00:46:01,051
Yo, that ain't mine! No!

461
00:46:01,135 --> 00:46:03,303
You know that's never gonna stick, right?

462
00:46:03,387 --> 00:46:05,597
Yeah, it's not supposed to.

463
00:46:07,266 --> 00:46:08,350


464
00:46:08,434 --> 00:46:10,269
Live it up! Live it up!

465
00:46:10,352 --> 00:46:11,854


466
00:46:43,177 --> 00:46:45,762


467
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,242
Yeah, Corona.

468
00:47:10,245 --> 00:47:11,622
That's too bad about Dwight.

469
00:47:11,705 --> 00:47:15,167
Having the Feds raid your house
the same night you make the team.

470
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:17,252
So unfortunate.

471
00:47:17,336 --> 00:47:20,756
I wish I could say
I was surprised to see you here.

472
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:25,594
What's to stop someone
from telling them you're a cop?

473
00:47:25,677 --> 00:47:29,431
Probably the same thing that's keeping me
from telling them why you're really here.

474
00:47:29,515 --> 00:47:31,767
- What up, fellows?
- Hey, how you doing?

475
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:34,478
- Great. You having a good time?
- Yeah, a great time.

476
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,105
Come on, let's have a better time.

477
00:47:37,648 --> 00:47:42,069
- How's your car? It took a nasty bump.
- It'll be ready.

478
00:47:42,903 --> 00:47:46,907
- I also heard you just got out of County.
- Yeah.

479
00:47:48,242 --> 00:47:49,993
You know a guy named Jim Garcia?

480
00:47:50,077 --> 00:47:54,122
Nah. Big place. Lots of names, lots of faces.

481
00:47:55,624 --> 00:47:58,669
And you,
you're wanted by a lot of people, homes.

482
00:47:58,752 --> 00:48:01,338
Yeah, that kind of heat
can't be good for business.

483
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,341
Yeah, well, that depends
on how you look at things.

484
00:48:04,424 --> 00:48:06,802
I go down, I do time.

485
00:48:07,844 --> 00:48:09,513
I do real time.

486
00:48:10,556 --> 00:48:15,143
I don't know about your other drivers,
but when I see flashing lights in my mirror,

487
00:48:15,227 --> 00:48:16,687
I don't stop.

488
00:48:22,067 --> 00:48:24,069
Do you know each other?

489
00:48:28,198 --> 00:48:30,325
He used to date my sister.

490
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:32,744
I see.

491
00:48:35,205 --> 00:48:37,708
- You're a lucky man.
- How's that?

492
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:40,752
You're still breathing.

493
00:48:42,546 --> 00:48:43,880


494
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,846
To the ladies we've loved
and the ladies we've lost.

495
00:48:51,054 --> 00:48:53,181


496
00:48:59,563 --> 00:49:01,607
So, what's Braga about?

497
00:49:03,525 --> 00:49:05,402
You know, he's just one of us

498
00:49:05,485 --> 00:49:08,947
Came up from the streets. Down for <i>el</i> barrio.

499
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:11,241
Now he's a shot caller.

500
00:49:12,075 --> 00:49:13,952
The boss of bosses.

501
00:49:14,578 --> 00:49:16,872
See all these cats in here?

502
00:49:17,456 --> 00:49:21,251
- Any one of them would die for Braga.
- Including you?

503
00:49:23,962 --> 00:49:25,589
Especially me.

504
00:49:28,508 --> 00:49:30,135


505
00:49:35,432 --> 00:49:37,184
Enjoy the party, fellows. Club's yours.

506
00:49:37,267 --> 00:49:40,479
Whatever you want, booze, broads, it's all good.

507
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:45,442
Braga's mine.

508
00:49:49,029 --> 00:49:51,448
I'm taking the whole house down.

509
00:49:52,199 --> 00:49:53,617
Good luck.

510
00:49:56,036 --> 00:49:57,829


511
00:50:41,998 --> 00:50:43,834


512
00:51:06,022 --> 00:51:07,691


513
00:52:01,369 --> 00:52:04,080
Something interests you about this car?

514
00:52:04,748 --> 00:52:06,958
Just admiring the body work.

515
00:52:08,585 --> 00:52:12,547
Are you one of those boys
who prefers cars to women?

516
00:52:16,009 --> 00:52:20,764
I'm one of those boys that appreciates
a fine body, regardless of the make.

517
00:52:24,434 --> 00:52:25,852
Your car?

518
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:31,608
It's Fenix's car.

519
00:52:32,776 --> 00:52:36,863
You'll meet him at the rendezvous.
He'll be leading you.

520
00:52:38,365 --> 00:52:39,783
So now

521
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:43,578
that I know your taste in cars,

522
00:52:43,662 --> 00:52:46,164
tell me, what about your women?

523
00:52:48,166 --> 00:52:50,335
It all starts with the eyes.

524
00:52:52,838 --> 00:52:58,051
She's got to have those kind of eyes
that can look right through the bullshit

525
00:52:58,134 --> 00:53:00,220
to the good in someone.

526
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:08,019
20% angel, 80% devil.

527
00:53:09,688 --> 00:53:11,523
Down to earth.

528
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:17,529
Ain't afraid to get a little
engine grease under her fingernails.

529
00:53:24,494 --> 00:53:27,122
That doesn't sound anything like me.

530
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:31,126
It ain't.

531
00:53:39,217 --> 00:53:40,218
- Hi.
- Hi.

532
00:53:40,302 --> 00:53:43,388
- I got a gift for you.
- All right.

533
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,974
A dirty shot glass, just what I always wanted.

534
00:53:46,099 --> 00:53:47,642
I got these from the club last night.

535
00:53:47,767 --> 00:53:49,728
There's two sets of prints here. Run them both.

536
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:53,315
I know one of these is Campos'.
I think the other might be Braga's.

537
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,984
And you're gonna have to go beyond Interpol.

538
00:53:56,067 --> 00:53:58,403
So, that means I have
to contact individual agencies,

539
00:53:58,486 --> 00:54:01,072
and that could take weeks. Okay.

540
00:54:01,156 --> 00:54:03,158


541
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,665


542
00:54:13,168 --> 00:54:14,669


543
00:54:16,087 --> 00:54:17,088
Yeah.

544
00:54:17,172 --> 00:54:20,342
That's your third traffic violation
in less than three blocks.

545
00:54:20,425 --> 00:54:22,427
Slow it down, O'Conner.

546
00:54:23,094 --> 00:54:24,804
Sure thing, Dad.

547
00:54:53,875 --> 00:54:54,960
He stopped.

548
00:55:07,305 --> 00:55:08,807


549
00:55:08,890 --> 00:55:09,975


550
00:55:44,092 --> 00:55:46,386


551
00:55:49,556 --> 00:55:51,016
We lost him.

552
00:55:51,099 --> 00:55:52,600
- He killed the tracker.
- We don't know that.

553
00:55:52,726 --> 00:55:55,353
- I'm telling you, he killed the tracker.
- We don't know that yet!

554
00:55:55,437 --> 00:55:56,938
Get the bird overhead.

555
00:55:58,023 --> 00:56:01,067
<i>Right now, I'm moving north, 33', 56'...</i>

556
00:56:05,113 --> 00:56:06,489
All clear.

557
00:56:29,429 --> 00:56:31,723
<i>Base, flag nine, I'm at Angels 5</i>

558
00:56:31,806 --> 00:56:35,435
<i>I don't have a tally on the target.
Repeat, I don't have a tally on the target.</i>

559
00:56:35,518 --> 00:56:37,228
They're gone, there's no one down there.

560
00:56:37,312 --> 00:56:38,646
Damn it!

561
00:56:49,699 --> 00:56:54,496
This ain't right, bro. Nobody said
nothing about being locked in no truck.

562
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:56,331
Tell me about it.

563
00:56:59,125 --> 00:57:00,835
Hey. Hey!

564
00:57:02,545 --> 00:57:05,590
- Yo!
- Where do you think they're taking us?

565
00:57:05,673 --> 00:57:07,300
Don't matter.

566
00:57:10,178 --> 00:57:13,014
We're all just along for the ride now.

567
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:26,152
Welcome to Mexico, boys.

568
00:57:31,866 --> 00:57:34,244
There are helicopters and surveillance cameras

569
00:57:34,369 --> 00:57:36,788
that scan for heat signatures at the border.

570
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:40,834
But there are blind spots that
I can guide you through via satellite.

571
00:57:40,917 --> 00:57:45,421
There can be no margin of error,
so you must follow my every direction.

572
00:57:46,172 --> 00:57:47,507
Any questions?

573
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:52,095
I thought Fenix was gonna be here.

574
00:57:55,265 --> 00:57:57,350
He'll meet you out there.

575
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:04,566
All right, everybody, sync up.

576
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:09,237
Good luck, gentlemen.

577
00:58:10,697 --> 00:58:12,407


578
00:58:22,709 --> 00:58:24,252
<i>Satellite linkup engaged</i>

579
00:58:25,587 --> 00:58:28,631
<i>Keep proceeding northbound at current speed.</i>

580
00:58:32,594 --> 00:58:34,470
<i>Stay close to Fenix.</i>

581
00:58:35,638 --> 00:58:37,098
<i>He'll lead you across.</i>

582
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,106


583
00:58:49,777 --> 00:58:51,196


584
00:58:51,279 --> 00:58:54,824
I got a heat signature
northbound along Legardo Ravine.

585
00:58:57,285 --> 00:59:01,831
Thermal imaging window on the Mexico
side's gonna be down for about 45 seconds.

586
00:59:01,956 --> 00:59:03,791
Get the camera on it.

587
00:59:03,917 --> 00:59:07,754
Manual override.
Rerouting camera to designated coordinates.

588
00:59:10,924 --> 00:59:13,676
<i>Hurry it up. You guys have been tagged.</i>

589
00:59:19,307 --> 00:59:21,100


590
00:59:23,478 --> 00:59:24,812
Shit.

591
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:28,441
<i>Toretto, get back in formation.</i>

592
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:32,654
Reimaging commencing.

593
00:59:41,454 --> 00:59:43,373
I don't see anything.

594
00:59:43,498 --> 00:59:44,666
They're gone.

595
00:59:46,709 --> 00:59:48,670
Get the helicopters to cover it.

596
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:55,885
<i>Base, we're forty seconds out
from Legardo Ravine.</i>

597
00:59:56,803 --> 00:59:58,388
<i>They're sending a helicopter.</i>

598
01:00:00,014 --> 01:00:01,891
<i>You have thirty seconds.</i>

599
01:00:10,692 --> 01:00:13,820
<i>North 32' 33', West 116' 49.</i>

600
01:00:20,326 --> 01:00:22,120
<i>The window is closing fast.</i>

601
01:00:22,203 --> 01:00:25,373
<i>You need to get out of there
before they send ground support.</i>

602
01:00:31,587 --> 01:00:33,256
<i>Fifteen seconds.</i>

603
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:41,055
<i>Base, target is at two miles.</i>

604
01:00:54,235 --> 01:00:56,446
<i>You're running out of time.</i>

605
01:00:59,532 --> 01:01:01,576
<i>You need to get out now!</i>

606
01:01:13,546 --> 01:01:17,550
<i>Base, we're at north 32' 33', west 116' 49'.</i>

607
01:01:17,633 --> 01:01:21,554
<i>We have no visual contact.
Roll ground units for confirmation.</i>

608
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:43,785
Sloppy!

609
01:01:44,452 --> 01:01:45,995
Very sloppy!

610
01:01:51,626 --> 01:01:53,669
What are you doing, man?

611
01:01:55,004 --> 01:01:56,089


612
01:01:56,172 --> 01:01:57,507
Come on.

613
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:59,300


614
01:02:00,635 --> 01:02:01,969
Get out.

615
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:06,682
Come on, man.

616
01:02:06,808 --> 01:02:08,726
Come on, today, man. Come on, let's go.

617
01:02:08,810 --> 01:02:10,686
Hey, don't touch me. Hey, don't touch me, man!

618
01:02:10,812 --> 01:02:11,979


619
01:02:12,105 --> 01:02:13,773
Hey, I said don't touch me, man!

620
01:02:13,856 --> 01:02:15,400
Hey, look, dawg, don't put your hands on me.

621
01:02:15,483 --> 01:02:17,026
Hey, Malik, chill, bro.

622
01:02:17,150 --> 01:02:18,277
Yo, man, what's up with your boy?

623
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:19,487


624
01:02:19,612 --> 01:02:21,197
Hey, boss man!

625
01:02:23,199 --> 01:02:24,909
What did you say?

626
01:02:24,992 --> 01:02:28,788
I said only pussies run nitrometh.

627
01:02:31,374 --> 01:02:33,459
You looked under my hood?

628
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:42,051
I'm talking to you.

629
01:02:42,176 --> 01:02:44,345
Got something on your mind?

630
01:02:45,179 --> 01:02:46,514
'70 Plymouth.

631
01:02:49,517 --> 01:02:50,810
Her name was Letty.

632
01:02:53,980 --> 01:02:55,022
Yo.

633
01:02:56,566 --> 01:02:58,317
Where's my money?

634
01:03:00,027 --> 01:03:02,363
<i>And somebody wrecked her car.</i>

635
01:03:10,163 --> 01:03:11,414
I wrecked her car.

636
01:03:11,664 --> 01:03:12,874


637
01:03:16,002 --> 01:03:17,044
You remember her face?

638
01:03:22,717 --> 01:03:23,759
Huh?

639
01:03:24,677 --> 01:03:26,345
'Cause I don't.

640
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:30,349
Last time I saw it, it was burning.

641
01:03:44,197 --> 01:03:45,531
Now what?

642
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,911
I'm going to enjoy what happens next.

643
01:03:55,458 --> 01:03:57,376


644
01:04:02,590 --> 01:04:03,633


645
01:04:05,927 --> 01:04:07,303


646
01:04:13,226 --> 01:04:14,393


647
01:04:20,733 --> 01:04:21,817


648
01:04:23,986 --> 01:04:25,488
Dom, get in!

649
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:28,449
Get in! Come on!

650
01:04:29,116 --> 01:04:30,368


651
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:34,288
Come on! Get in the fucking car!
Let's go! Hurry up!

652
01:04:36,290 --> 01:04:38,376


653
01:04:56,394 --> 01:04:57,728


654
01:04:58,187 --> 01:04:59,730


655
01:05:01,315 --> 01:05:02,942
What have you got, Trinh?

656
01:05:03,025 --> 01:05:05,611
We're contacting agencies in multiple countries.

657
01:05:05,695 --> 01:05:10,658
Unfortunately, most of them have to
manually scan their prints for us to upload.

658
01:05:11,492 --> 01:05:13,619
O'Conner's on line five.

659
01:05:13,703 --> 01:05:16,831
- And, sir, you should see this.
- Thank you.

660
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:27,633


661
01:05:27,717 --> 01:05:28,843
Talk to me, O'Conner.

662
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:31,470
- <i>Where the hell have you been?</i>
- I got the shipment.

663
01:05:31,554 --> 01:05:34,557
"I got the shipment," or "we got the shipment"?

664
01:05:34,682 --> 01:05:36,684
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

665
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:41,230
Traffic cams in the area picked up
pictures of you and Toretto together.

666
01:05:42,356 --> 01:05:47,111
Listen to me, O'Conner.
Bring in the shipment and bring in Toretto.

667
01:05:47,528 --> 01:05:50,197
But I thought the point was to get Braga.
We got an opportunity here.

668
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:52,867
Brian, the clock stopped ticking.

669
01:05:53,743 --> 01:05:56,037
<i>Bring them in. Are we clear?</i>

670
01:06:00,374 --> 01:06:01,709
<i>O'Conner?</i>

671
01:06:01,792 --> 01:06:03,127


672
01:06:11,719 --> 01:06:14,555
So this is what $60 million looks like.

673
01:06:16,307 --> 01:06:18,934
Yeah, we got to get you to a doctor.

674
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:21,729
We got to find a place to hide this.

675
01:06:24,273 --> 01:06:25,441
I got a spot.

676
01:06:35,576 --> 01:06:38,454
502, wet reckless. I need a 48-hour hold.

677
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:42,416
Out back. Any spot you can find.

678
01:06:47,588 --> 01:06:49,465
You sure about this?

679
01:06:50,424 --> 01:06:56,597
Yeah. The last place they'll check,
their own impound yard. Trust me.

680
01:07:03,104 --> 01:07:04,980
You know, I've been thinking,

681
01:07:05,106 --> 01:07:07,566
when you blew up your car back there,
you blew up mine, too.

682
01:07:07,650 --> 01:07:10,111
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

683
01:07:10,194 --> 01:07:12,780
So now you owe me a ten-second car.

684
01:07:14,115 --> 01:07:16,367
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

685
01:07:27,628 --> 01:07:29,338
Now we're even.

686
01:07:42,518 --> 01:07:44,228


687
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:47,940
Is this your way of keeping me away from him?

688
01:07:48,023 --> 01:07:51,861
- You're the only one I could call.
- He's my brother, of course.

689
01:07:59,493 --> 01:08:01,579
The bullet's not in there.

690
01:08:09,170 --> 01:08:13,090
I'm gonna clean it and
stitch it up. It's going to hurt.

691
01:08:13,174 --> 01:08:15,676
I bet you're going to enjoy this.

692
01:08:16,343 --> 01:08:17,678
A little.

693
01:08:20,598 --> 01:08:23,017
- Want some of this?
- Yeah.

694
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:25,186
It's spicy.

695
01:08:26,896 --> 01:08:28,522
I like it hot.

696
01:08:29,690 --> 01:08:31,859
Dom, what are you doing?

697
01:08:31,942 --> 01:08:34,862
You reached first, you have to say grace.

698
01:08:45,206 --> 01:08:49,043
Thank you, Lord, for blessing this table.

699
01:08:50,544 --> 01:08:55,257
With food, family and friendship.

700
01:09:28,999 --> 01:09:31,335
You asked me why I let Dom go.

701
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:36,090
I think it's because at that moment,

702
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:40,636
I respected him more than I did myself.

703
01:09:45,015 --> 01:09:46,267
Yeah.

704
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:52,940
One thing I learned from Dom is that nothing
really matters unless you have a code.

705
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:58,445
And what's your code, Brian?

706
01:10:00,823 --> 01:10:02,616
I'm working on it.

707
01:10:19,842 --> 01:10:21,135


708
01:10:25,139 --> 01:10:26,223


709
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:28,976


710
01:10:37,484 --> 01:10:39,069
Shit. Hey, Dom.

711
01:10:39,153 --> 01:10:41,697
- When were you gonna tell me?
- Dom, what are you doing?

712
01:10:41,822 --> 01:10:43,741
When were you gonna tell me
you were running Letty?

713
01:10:43,824 --> 01:10:46,160
- Let me explain...
- When were you gonna...

714
01:10:51,582 --> 01:10:52,875
Dom, stop!

715
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,127
- You don't understand.
- I don't understand?

716
01:10:55,210 --> 01:10:56,420
Stop!

717
01:10:57,170 --> 01:10:59,089


718
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:01,842
She did it for...

719
01:11:02,509 --> 01:11:04,178


720
01:11:04,887 --> 01:11:06,430
Dom, stop!

721
01:11:06,513 --> 01:11:08,682
Dom, stop it! Please stop!

722
01:11:12,353 --> 01:11:13,896


723
01:11:14,605 --> 01:11:16,023


724
01:11:18,067 --> 01:11:21,695
She did it for you, Dom! She did it for you!

725
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:30,537
Letty came to me to clear your name
in exchange for bringing down Braga.

726
01:11:33,582 --> 01:11:36,085
She just wanted you to come home!

727
01:11:52,226 --> 01:11:53,268


728
01:11:53,394 --> 01:11:55,062
I'm sorry, Dom!

729
01:11:55,145 --> 01:11:56,563
I'm sorry!

730
01:12:21,338 --> 01:12:25,676
You better have one hell of an explanation.

731
01:12:25,759 --> 01:12:27,261
You disobeyed a direct order.

732
01:12:28,137 --> 01:12:30,139
- Where's the shipment?
- It's safe.

733
01:12:30,264 --> 01:12:32,016
It's safe.

734
01:12:32,099 --> 01:12:34,977
Look, we could use the shipment
to parade in front of the media,

735
01:12:35,102 --> 01:12:36,979
get a few hundred pounds
of heroin off the street,

736
01:12:37,104 --> 01:12:40,774
but Braga's just gonna send another
shipment next week and the week after that.

737
01:12:40,858 --> 01:12:42,985
Let's use the shipment to lure Braga out

738
01:12:43,110 --> 01:12:45,112
and lop the head off
a multi-billion dollar cartel.

739
01:12:45,195 --> 01:12:49,616
- And how do you suggest we do that?
- A hand-to-hand exchange with Braga.

740
01:12:49,700 --> 01:12:52,619
- He'll never show.
- He can't afford not to.

741
01:13:03,130 --> 01:13:04,798
You got a plan?

742
01:13:06,300 --> 01:13:07,968
There's a price.

743
01:13:10,804 --> 01:13:13,640
We bag Braga, you let Toretto walk.

744
01:13:18,312 --> 01:13:19,813


745
01:13:22,399 --> 01:13:24,651
- Yes?
- <i>It's Dom.</i>

746
01:13:25,652 --> 01:13:27,988
<i>I was just thinking about you.</i>

747
01:13:28,322 --> 01:13:32,242
You know, when I gave you my number,
I was hoping you'd call.

748
01:13:32,826 --> 01:13:35,370
But not under these circumstances.

749
01:13:35,704 --> 01:13:38,832
What circumstances? Me being alive?

750
01:13:39,875 --> 01:13:41,835
<i>Don't take it personally.</i>

751
01:13:42,336 --> 01:13:45,923
- It's just business.
- I got some business of my own.

752
01:13:47,216 --> 01:13:48,675
Get Campos.

753
01:13:51,178 --> 01:13:52,596
It's them.

754
01:13:58,185 --> 01:14:02,189
Was that how Braga inspires loyalty?
Killing his drivers?

755
01:14:02,689 --> 01:14:05,025
One can always find more drivers.

756
01:14:05,275 --> 01:14:07,277
<i>It's just good business.</i>

757
01:14:07,528 --> 01:14:08,779
I want to trade.

758
01:14:09,070 --> 01:14:12,199
- Braga doesn't negotiate.
- <i>Fine.</i>

759
01:14:12,282 --> 01:14:17,204
You explain to him how all of a sudden
$60 million worth of product disappears.

760
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:20,207
I know that can't be good for business.

761
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:22,793
What do you want?

762
01:14:23,293 --> 01:14:27,548
Six million cash, delivered by Braga himself.

763
01:14:27,965 --> 01:14:29,258


764
01:14:30,217 --> 01:14:31,885
<i>I don't like being shot at.</i>

765
01:14:32,219 --> 01:14:35,472
I ain't gonna put my neck out again
unless he's got something to lose, too.

766
01:14:35,556 --> 01:14:37,141
He'll never go for it.

767
01:14:37,224 --> 01:14:40,894
Either I deal with Braga, or you do.

768
01:14:44,898 --> 01:14:46,400
When and where?

769
01:15:01,456 --> 01:15:05,419
Sir, players are onsite.
Holding positions at the perimeter.

770
01:15:05,836 --> 01:15:08,422
All right. Listen up. Everybody stay frosty.

771
01:15:08,505 --> 01:15:11,216
<i>We don't move a muscle until
O'Conner gives the signal.</i>

772
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:13,969
When he gets the money, you know what to do.

773
01:15:14,595 --> 01:15:17,055
Well, the good news is, when we get this guy,

774
01:15:17,139 --> 01:15:19,516
you walk out of here a free man.

775
01:15:19,933 --> 01:15:21,310
Is that what they told you?

776
01:15:21,435 --> 01:15:23,061
Yeah, that's the deal.

777
01:15:23,145 --> 01:15:26,523
You still put milk and
cookies out for Santa Claus?

778
01:15:27,816 --> 01:15:28,984
Yeah.

779
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:34,907
Here.

780
01:15:34,990 --> 01:15:37,034
In case things go shitty.

781
01:15:41,997 --> 01:15:44,666
- Just like old times?
- Yeah.

782
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:48,921


783
01:15:49,004 --> 01:15:50,297
You dropped something.

784
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:52,591
- That's what you wanted, right?
- Dom...

785
01:15:52,674 --> 01:15:54,468


786
01:15:54,968 --> 01:15:57,804


787
01:16:07,648 --> 01:16:10,317
He's harmless. Don't worry about him.

788
01:16:12,027 --> 01:16:14,529
And he's really sorry about Letty.

789
01:16:16,657 --> 01:16:18,492
Where's our stuff?

790
01:16:21,203 --> 01:16:24,498
You mean the stuff
that used to be in here, right?

791
01:16:25,666 --> 01:16:29,503
Well, you'll see it
when we see Braga. That was the deal.

792
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:31,838
No worries.

793
01:16:32,214 --> 01:16:34,216
Braga keeps his word.

794
01:17:08,917 --> 01:17:10,377


795
01:17:18,218 --> 01:17:19,720
$2 million.

796
01:17:20,804 --> 01:17:23,557
You get the rest when I get my property.

797
01:17:27,894 --> 01:17:29,563
- Stasiak.
- <i>We got a match.</i>

798
01:17:29,646 --> 01:17:31,648
The fingerprint's Braga's 100%.

799
01:17:31,732 --> 01:17:34,234
<i>Just waiting on facial confirmation via fax.</i>

800
01:17:34,318 --> 01:17:36,236
<i>I got a question for you.</i>

801
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:40,073
You wearing pink when you were clawing
your way out of <i>el</i> barrio?

802
01:17:41,325 --> 01:17:42,784
Order all agents to move in.

803
01:17:42,909 --> 01:17:45,912
We got confirmation.
Primary suspect wearing gray suit.

804
01:17:45,996 --> 01:17:47,080
Let's move.

805
01:17:47,164 --> 01:17:49,082
Sir, O'Conner hasn't given us the signal yet.

806
01:17:49,166 --> 01:17:52,502
What part of that didn't you understand?
We just got confirmation. Do it!

807
01:17:52,586 --> 01:17:55,922
Secure primary suspect in gray suit. Repeat!

808
01:17:56,006 --> 01:17:58,592
<i>Secure primary suspect in gray suit.</i>

809
01:18:12,064 --> 01:18:14,775
You're thinking what I'm thinking, right?

810
01:18:17,569 --> 01:18:19,196
He ain't Braga.

811
01:18:23,784 --> 01:18:24,868
Oh, shit.

812
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:27,037
- Drop your weapons!
- FBI!

813
01:18:27,620 --> 01:18:28,914
Get down!

814
01:18:28,997 --> 01:18:30,290


815
01:18:32,417 --> 01:18:34,127
Get out of here!

816
01:18:38,215 --> 01:18:40,092
Get out of here, Dom!

817
01:18:42,928 --> 01:18:44,304


818
01:18:44,388 --> 01:18:45,972
Run him down.

819
01:18:46,473 --> 01:18:47,682
Go!

820
01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:50,018
Campos is Braga!

821
01:18:50,102 --> 01:18:51,812


822
01:18:57,484 --> 01:18:58,777
Come on.

823
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:00,195


824
01:19:06,159 --> 01:19:08,286
Approaching primary target.

825
01:19:08,829 --> 01:19:10,997
<i>Primary suspect is secure.</i>

826
01:19:13,667 --> 01:19:15,460
<i>He was under your nose the whole time.</i>

827
01:19:16,002 --> 01:19:17,754
Now Braga's escaped.

828
01:19:17,838 --> 01:19:20,841
Toretto's heading south,
probably long across the border by now.

829
01:19:20,924 --> 01:19:23,135
Do you have any idea the kind of trouble
you're in, O'Conner?

830
01:19:23,218 --> 01:19:25,178
I was doing my job.

831
01:19:25,262 --> 01:19:27,764
He ain't the first bad guy
you helped escape the law's grasp.

832
01:19:27,848 --> 01:19:29,850
As of now, you're being taken off active duty,

833
01:19:29,933 --> 01:19:32,853
until this house can mount a formal inquiry.

834
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:36,773
What about Braga?

835
01:19:37,858 --> 01:19:40,193
That's no longer your concern.

836
01:19:50,579 --> 01:19:52,080
We now know where Braga is, right?

837
01:19:52,164 --> 01:19:55,625
Customs tracked him via satellite
to his home base in Tecali, Mexico.

838
01:19:55,709 --> 01:19:58,128
Mexico is out of our jurisdiction.

839
01:20:00,922 --> 01:20:02,549
The fact is

840
01:20:02,632 --> 01:20:06,720
the brass will be so busy holding
press conferences over the seizure,

841
01:20:06,803 --> 01:20:08,889
we'll skate under the radar.

842
01:20:09,347 --> 01:20:12,392
I thought we signed on to do the right thing.

843
01:20:50,764 --> 01:20:52,891
Everyone's looking for you.

844
01:20:53,266 --> 01:20:54,893
I'm right here.

845
01:20:56,186 --> 01:20:57,562
It's nice to see you've gone with the times

846
01:20:57,646 --> 01:21:01,191
and switched to
electronic fuel injection. Looks good.

847
01:21:02,317 --> 01:21:04,402
Buster became a gearhead.

848
01:21:08,490 --> 01:21:10,283
I'm going with you.

849
01:21:14,204 --> 01:21:16,873
I don't plan on bringing anyone back.

850
01:21:18,833 --> 01:21:20,168
I know.

851
01:21:28,969 --> 01:21:30,637
Hit that throttle.

852
01:21:47,028 --> 01:21:48,363


853
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:57,998
Hey.

854
01:22:14,014 --> 01:22:15,515


855
01:22:39,789 --> 01:22:42,792
How do you say goodbye to your only brother?

856
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:46,379
You don't.

857
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:01,770


858
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:57,659
I thought you weren't gonna show up.

859
01:23:57,784 --> 01:23:59,369
You saved my life.

860
01:24:00,286 --> 01:24:02,706
I'm willing to return the favor.

861
01:24:06,626 --> 01:24:09,129
This will help get you to Braga.

862
01:24:13,299 --> 01:24:14,384
Dom.

863
01:24:15,385 --> 01:24:18,012
Going in there is suicide.

864
01:24:26,604 --> 01:24:28,314
I have no choice.

865
01:24:31,943 --> 01:24:34,362
You must have loved her very much.

866
01:24:43,329 --> 01:24:44,956


867
01:24:52,464 --> 01:24:55,175
So this is where my jurisdiction ends.

868
01:25:00,972 --> 01:25:03,141
And this is where mine begins.

869
01:25:05,643 --> 01:25:07,020


870
01:25:42,680 --> 01:25:44,390


871
01:25:51,230 --> 01:25:52,565


872
01:25:56,360 --> 01:25:57,779


873
01:25:59,030 --> 01:26:06,079


874
01:26:19,259 --> 01:26:21,594


875
01:26:26,432 --> 01:26:30,979


876
01:27:02,427 --> 01:27:04,012


877
01:27:13,479 --> 01:27:15,356
You ain't forgiven.

878
01:27:18,818 --> 01:27:20,945
You boys want to arrest me?

879
01:27:21,029 --> 01:27:23,948


880
01:27:24,032 --> 01:27:26,117
No, we're beyond that.

881
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:29,954
You can't buy your way out of this one.

882
01:27:31,330 --> 01:27:32,999
You and me...

883
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:37,086
You and me, we're not so different.

884
01:27:38,796 --> 01:27:40,423
You're no hero.

885
01:27:51,017 --> 01:27:52,685
You're right.

886
01:27:55,813 --> 01:27:59,150
And that's why you're
going back across the border.

887
01:28:03,696 --> 01:28:05,031


888
01:28:05,156 --> 01:28:06,866
But Fenix is mine.

889
01:28:07,867 --> 01:28:08,993
You got it.

890
01:28:17,210 --> 01:28:18,378


891
01:28:23,049 --> 01:28:24,884


892
01:28:31,140 --> 01:28:32,392
Shit!

893
01:28:32,475 --> 01:28:34,060


894
01:28:37,397 --> 01:28:40,984
You'll make it a couple
of miles out, if you're lucky.

895
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:43,194


896
01:28:43,319 --> 01:28:45,822


897
01:28:50,910 --> 01:28:53,079


898
01:28:53,162 --> 01:28:54,664


899
01:29:09,595 --> 01:29:11,264


900
01:29:16,602 --> 01:29:17,687


901
01:29:17,770 --> 01:29:19,397


902
01:29:29,949 --> 01:29:30,950


903
01:29:33,536 --> 01:29:35,747
You know where you're going?

904
01:29:36,789 --> 01:29:38,958
You want to borrow my GPS?

905
01:29:41,544 --> 01:29:42,628


906
01:29:42,712 --> 01:29:44,380
Where are your boys at?

907
01:29:44,464 --> 01:29:45,965
Are they going to show up or what?

908
01:29:46,090 --> 01:29:47,383


909
01:29:49,469 --> 01:29:51,554
Careful what you ask for.

910
01:30:07,820 --> 01:30:10,073
Just stop. Just stop the car.

911
01:30:13,117 --> 01:30:14,410


912
01:30:14,494 --> 01:30:15,787


913
01:30:22,585 --> 01:30:24,837


914
01:30:30,259 --> 01:30:31,928
Right behind you.

915
01:30:46,776 --> 01:30:49,904
Dom, head to the tunnel. Let's use the tunnel.

916
01:31:09,507 --> 01:31:10,675


917
01:31:17,140 --> 01:31:19,100
Get out of here, Brian.

918
01:31:24,313 --> 01:31:25,815


919
01:31:26,816 --> 01:31:30,319
You sure you know where
the tunnels are? You sure?

920
01:31:30,862 --> 01:31:32,613
Yeah. I'd hold on.

921
01:31:35,700 --> 01:31:37,368
This might hurt.

922
01:31:50,756 --> 01:31:52,925
You're in my world now, baby!

923
01:32:07,899 --> 01:32:08,941


924
01:32:13,279 --> 01:32:14,572


925
01:32:21,537 --> 01:32:24,123
That's it, baby! End of the road.

926
01:32:24,207 --> 01:32:25,625
Now what?

927
01:32:26,417 --> 01:32:27,501
Game over.

928
01:32:27,585 --> 01:32:29,128
No,no,no.

929
01:32:31,630 --> 01:32:32,715


930
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:44,685


931
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:52,026


932
01:32:58,740 --> 01:33:00,159
Come on!

933
01:33:03,537 --> 01:33:04,580


934
01:33:06,332 --> 01:33:07,375


935
01:33:07,458 --> 01:33:08,709


936
01:33:18,678 --> 01:33:19,887


937
01:33:24,016 --> 01:33:25,059


938
01:33:30,982 --> 01:33:32,066


939
01:34:14,483 --> 01:34:15,526


940
01:34:19,363 --> 01:34:20,448
Hey!

941
01:34:21,574 --> 01:34:23,409
Get me out of here!

942
01:34:46,432 --> 01:34:47,475


943
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:08,537


944
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:12,083


945
01:35:12,166 --> 01:35:13,667


946
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:15,044


947
01:35:19,924 --> 01:35:21,092


948
01:35:22,093 --> 01:35:23,386


949
01:35:53,540 --> 01:35:54,959
Pussy.

950
01:36:04,969 --> 01:36:06,387


951
01:36:12,350 --> 01:36:13,978
Let me see that.

952
01:36:16,522 --> 01:36:18,899
Yeah. Just keep pressure there.

953
01:36:18,983 --> 01:36:20,025


954
01:36:20,109 --> 01:36:21,569
You'll be all right.

955
01:36:21,652 --> 01:36:23,487


956
01:36:27,450 --> 01:36:29,535
You gotta get out of here.

957
01:36:32,163 --> 01:36:34,165
I ain't running any more.

958
01:36:39,795 --> 01:36:41,881
I gotta ask you something.

959
01:36:42,548 --> 01:36:43,674
Yeah?

960
01:36:44,425 --> 01:36:48,471
You know I would have won
that race if you didn't cheat, right?

961
01:36:51,557 --> 01:36:53,476
You hit your head hard.

962
01:36:53,559 --> 01:36:54,768


963
01:36:58,397 --> 01:37:00,232
Don't make me laugh.

964
01:37:09,325 --> 01:37:10,576


965
01:37:10,910 --> 01:37:12,286
All rise.

966
01:37:17,583 --> 01:37:19,293
Please be seated.

967
01:37:23,589 --> 01:37:25,591
Please rise, Mr. Toretto.

968
01:37:27,968 --> 01:37:30,262
I've listened to the testimony

969
01:37:30,763 --> 01:37:32,932
and taken into special consideration

970
01:37:33,015 --> 01:37:36,977
Agent O'Conner's appeal of clemency
on behalf of Mr. Toretto.

971
01:37:37,937 --> 01:37:40,606
That his actions
directly resulted in the apprehension

972
01:37:40,689 --> 01:37:43,526
of known drug trafficker Arturo Braga.

973
01:37:45,110 --> 01:37:46,445
However,

974
01:37:47,780 --> 01:37:49,740
this judiciary finds that

975
01:37:49,823 --> 01:37:54,620
one right does not make up
for a lifetime worth of wrongs.

976
01:37:55,287 --> 01:37:57,039
And as such,

977
01:37:57,122 --> 01:38:02,127
I find that I am forced to level
the maximum sentence under California law.

978
01:38:04,547 --> 01:38:06,215
Dominic Toretto,

979
01:38:07,049 --> 01:38:11,053
you are hereby sentenced
to serve 25 years to life

980
01:38:11,136 --> 01:38:14,223
at the Lompoc maximum security prison system

981
01:38:14,974 --> 01:38:17,810
<i>without the possibility of early parole.</i>

982
01:38:18,352 --> 01:38:20,187
<i>This court is adjourned.</i>
