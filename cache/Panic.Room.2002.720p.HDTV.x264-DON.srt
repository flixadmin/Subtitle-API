1
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,120
I wrote it all down:
4,222 square feet, four floors. Perfect.

2
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,800
Courtyard in back,
south-facing garden. Perfect.

3
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,240
-Shouldn't we wait for the car service?
-No, we'll sit in traffic forever.

4
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,720
-ls that the listing sheet?
-There isn't one.

5
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,400
I heard about it this morning.
lt'll be gone soon.

6
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,440
-How many more?
-None. You know the market is tight.

7
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,360
-Sarah, do you have to ride that here?
-Mom, we're in the street.

8
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,120
Evan!

9
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,200
One day you will learn
to respect people's time, Lydia.

10
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,640
You'll realize that the world does not stop
and start at your convenience.

11
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:13,960
l'm so sorry.

12
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,800
l'm meeting Arthur Digby Laurence
in 26 minutes...

13
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,360
...and if you think he's the kind of man
who tolerates tardiness...

14
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,280
...you are sadly mistaken.

15
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,720
You're a saint to wait for us.

16
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,600
-Thank you.
-Hello.

17
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,520
lt's kind of between a townhouse
and a brownstone.

18
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,960
We call it a "townstone."

19
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,600
Built in 1879, this is the middle
of the house, the parlor floor.

20
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,720
Here is the living room.
Formal dining is in the back.

21
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,400
Casual dining below on the kitchen floor...

22
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,360
...which was renovated in '94
with all the expected amenities.

23
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,800
Sarah.

24
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,600
There are two bedroom floors above.

25
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,400
My God, it's amazing.

26
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,680
Hey, kid. No scooter.

27
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,080
l don't have to tell you this amount
of living space is uncommon in Manhattan.

28
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,280
lt's got a yard. Sort of.

29
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,760
lt is in a bit of disarray, but then again,
21-foot lot, 53 deep.

30
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,680
lt allows for an expansive garden.

31
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,760
Working elevator.

32
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,920
The previous owner was disabled
the last years of his life.

33
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,520
Highly unusual, the elevator.

34
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,920
You will not find this
in 90 percent of brownstones.

35
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,080
Perhaps it's something of a fixer-upper,
but we anticipate enormous interest.

36
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,280
lt's a very emotional property.

37
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,760
Shall we have a look at the rest?

38
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,560
You should make an offer immediately.

39
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,000
Can l see it first?

40
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,480
There is nothing like this
on the market right now.

41
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,960
You can't move from Greenwich
to the Upper West Side...

42
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,800
...and expect to still have a house, a yard
and a dog and cat, but here it is.

43
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,440
lt's got everything
you told me you wanted and more.

44
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,600
You'll have another family.
You could have two.

45
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,920
lt's a fortune.

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,120
Mom, it's not Barneys.
You don't have to pay the price on the tag.

47
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,000
He can afford it.

48
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,960
lt would be so lovely
if l could show the property before l leave.

49
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,240
Hardwood floors throughout,
as many as six working fireplaces.

50
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,640
This is the top floor. Two bedrooms.
One at either end.

51
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,600
They share one small bath.

52
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,360
Originally, this would have been
the servants' quarters.

53
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,960
The previous owner
kept a small nursing staff.

54
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,320
l don't know if you have live-in help.

55
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,080
No, it's just the two of us.

56
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,600
Third floor, spare bedroom, den,
or what have you.

57
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,080
Mr. Pearlstine used this as an office.

58
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,080
He's talking about Sidney Pearlstine,
the financier.

59
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,800
May l ask what you do, Mrs....

60
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,600
Altman.

61
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,120
Actually, l'm going back to school.
Columbia.

62
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,160
Her husband's in pharmaceuticals.

63
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,840
l didn't realize
you were Stephan Altman's wife.

64
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,600
Yes, until recently.

65
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,960
Master bath.

66
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,280
Pearlstine's been in all the papers
since he died.

67
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,840
His kids are suing each other
over the estate.

68
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,880
He was a recluse. Rich, paranoid.

69
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,040
Now they can't find half his money.

70
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,920
l hardly see how gossip
is germane to showing the property.

71
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,160
Stop calling it "the property."
lt sounds ridiculous.

72
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,440
Walk-in closet.

73
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,400
Could the little one please stop that?

74
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,000
Kid, no elevator!

75
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,720
And we emerge in the master suite.

76
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,040
That's strange.

77
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,240
What?

78
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,480
ls this room smaller than it should be?

79
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,560
You're the first person to notice.

80
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,160
On caravan, no one from our office
had the slightest idea.

81
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,440
lt's called a panic room.

82
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,200
-What?
-A safe room.

83
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:31,280
-A castle keep in medieval times.
-l've read about these.

84
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,520
They're in vogue in high-end construction.

85
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,160
One can't be too careful
about home invasion.

86
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,560
This is perfect.

87
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,800
The alarm goes off
in the middle of the night.

88
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,760
What will you do?
Call the police and wait till Tuesday?

89
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,360
Traipse downstairs in your underthings
to check it out? l think not.

90
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,360
Concrete walls. Buried phone line,
not connected to the house's main line.

91
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,040
Call the police, nobody can cut you off.
You have your own ventilation system.

92
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,160
A bank of surveillance monitors that covers
nearly every corner of the house.

93
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,360
This whole thing makes me nervous.

94
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,720
Why?

95
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,560
Ever read any Poe?

96
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,800
No, but l loved her last album.

97
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,120
What's to keep somebody
from prying open the door?

98
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,320
Steel.

99
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,920
Thick steel. Very thick steel.

100
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,480
Full battery backup,
so even if the power's out...

101
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,120
...it's still functional.

102
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,920
Oh, my god.
Old Sidney didn't miss a trick, did he?

103
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,080
Open it, please.

104
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,600
And with kids like he's apparently got,
no wonder he wanted a place to hide.

105
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,840
Please open the door.

106
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,440
That is highly inappropriate.

107
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,400
Open the door, please.

108
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,000
My room. Definitely my room.

109
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,640
This is really dangerous.

110
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,000
-That door is a hazard.
-Not at all.

111
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:50,280
Motion detector, like an elevator.

112
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,840
The door won't close if it's blocked.
There's another one at your ankles.

113
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,000
lt couldn't be safer.

114
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,920
l know they'll take asking price.

115
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,680
lt's working. l hooked up the phone!

116
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,600
Good for you, Mom. Hooked up a phone.

117
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,360
579 what?

118
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,440
3000.

119
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,640
patsy's pizza. pIease hoId.

120
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,760
Hey. Enough.

121
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,120
Mind the pizza?

122
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,560
What do you mean?

123
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,840
Our first night.
l should've thought of something special.

124
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,360
l like pizza.

125
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,920
Fuck him.

126
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,320
Don't.

127
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,480
Fuck her, too.

128
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,360
l agree.

129
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,040
But don't.

130
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,040
Don't you think this place
has way too many stairs?

131
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,880
You didn't carry anything up them.

132
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,360
You never asked
what l thought of this house.

133
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,480
l didn't want you to tell me you hated it.

134
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,760
-l liked our old house.
-Well, so did l.

135
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,120
You know what l was thinking?

136
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:14,720
l was thinking we could
stencil the whole bookcase.

137
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,560
We could cut the stencils, do it ourselves.

138
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,480
Go ahead.

139
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,680
Oh, damn.

140
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,840
l forgot to set up that tour
of your new school.

141
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,160
Dad already did it.
l'm going with him on Sunday.

142
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,600
Oh, yeah?

143
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,040
So l'll take a cab and meet him there.

144
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,040
ls that what he said?

145
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,840
lsn't that what's so great
about Manhattan?

146
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,960
You don't have to drive me everywhere?

147
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,360
l'll ride with you.

148
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,560
Why'd you bring me here
if l can't go anywhere on my own?

149
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,160
That's it. l quit.

150
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,920
l'm not fighting with you till tomorrow.

151
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,880
Come here.

152
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,400
lt's disgusting how much l love you.

153
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,080
Tell me about it.

154
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,240
-Mom?
-Yeah.

155
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,640
lt's too dark.

156
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,240
Better?

157
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,120
That's better.

158
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,840
"Bypass non-ready zone."

159
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,320
"Bypass non-ready zone."

160
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,040
"Shunt. Enter."

161
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,560
"Bypass non-ready zone."

162
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,160
"Shunt."

163
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,160
"Enter zone number."

164
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,520
"Shunt again."

165
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,320
ln the morning l got to figure out
how to turn this thing off.

166
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,760
Go, go back.

167
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,840
Do it.

168
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,560
Come on. Come on. Jesus fucking Christ.

169
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,240
Amateur.

170
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,080
We got a problem! We need to talk!

171
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,680
lt's about time. l'm freezing
my tits off out there.

172
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,280
-Who is that?
-This is Raoul.

173
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,760
Who the fuck is Raoul?

174
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,600
Raoul is okay. Raoul has experience.

175
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,960
-Where'd you get him?
-Through some people.

176
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,640
Open the fucking door.

177
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:59,000
No shit.

178
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,840
What is this?

179
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,160
There's a girl on the top floor,
a woman on the third. They're asleep.

180
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,600
They're not supposed to be here.

181
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,800
-This is your department, Junior!
-They are not supposed to be here!

182
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,760
Videotape. We're on videotape.

183
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,680
We've been on videotape since we got here
and the tapes are upstairs.

184
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,240
-14-day escrow.
-You fucked me!

185
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,200
14-day escrow! That's almost 3 weeks!
They should not be in for another week!

186
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,720
Exactly how is 14 days three weeks?

187
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,440
Business days.
Escrow is always business days.

188
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,200
Five-day weeks always!

189
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,680
Right?

190
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,000
l'm out of here.

191
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,880
Just wait a minute. Wait a minute!

192
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,080
We can handle this.
Can we still handle this?

193
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,320
lt's just a woman and a kid?

194
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,560
-Unless Daddy comes home.
-He's not.

195
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,400
They're divorcing. Daddy's banging some
B model on the Upper East Side.

196
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,200
lt's just her and the kid!

197
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,160
Now, can we do this?

198
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,240
Yeah, we can do it.

199
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,200
Not with people here. And not with me.

200
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,360
-Wait! Twenty minutes!
-She'll call the police.

201
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,320
They'll be here before l unpack my bags.

202
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,320
So, we keep an eye on her.

203
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,880
Raoul can totally administrate that part.

204
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,840
l don't want Raoul to administrate that!
He's not even supposed to be here!

205
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,480
Nobody gets hurt.

206
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,160
What about us? What if she has a gun?

207
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,320
Who are you?

208
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,880
l'm Raoul.

209
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,720
You know we can't do this without you!

210
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,520
This is still a good plan.

211
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,680
Fuck that! This is a great plan.
lt's just got a slight twist.

212
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,040
Yeah.

213
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,160
Felony kidnapping. Thirty years.

214
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,880
You make a lot of promises, don't you?
You promise me, you promise your kids.

215
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,880
No family.

216
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,520
You're right. lt's all fucked up.
l fucked it up!

217
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,600
lt's not how it's supposed to be.

218
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:26,800
But the fact of the matter is
there's still $3,000,000 in this house...

219
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:30,880
...and no one but you and l
even knows it's here.

220
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,880
Hey, l want that money. l want it!

221
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,560
But you...

222
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,840
...you need that money.

223
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,720
Or have you forgotten why you're here?

224
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,600
So let's quit dicking around, okay,
and get this over with.

225
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,440
Kill the phones.

226
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,120
Top floor, little girl. l've got the mother.
Give me that!

227
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:38,720
You stay here! Nobody gets past!

228
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,440
Wake up! Sarah!

229
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,000
Get up!

230
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,560
What did you do that for?

231
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,520
Where are you going?

232
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,600
-What's going on?
-People. ln the house.

233
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,320
They're in the elevator, heading down.

234
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,840
Fuck! They're coming down to you!

235
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,320
l told you. l don't hurt people.

236
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,520
They're going downstairs.

237
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,040
-That room.
-What?

238
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,560
The panic room.

239
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,120
No, press emergency stop.

240
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,560
Fuck!

241
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,360
Coming back up!

242
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,440
That's you.

243
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,600
Shit.

244
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,760
Go!

245
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:37,960
Fuck!

246
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,480
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

247
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,360
Damn it! Mother--

248
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,160
Shit!

249
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,920
That's seven years bad luck.

250
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,080
Shit.

251
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:20,040
Tell me they're not in there.

252
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,320
Oh, damn.

253
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,840
-lt doesn't work?
-lt's a different phone line.

254
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,680
l never hooked it up.

255
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,600
Now what?

256
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,880
l can't hear a thing.

257
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,480
What do you think they want?

258
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,360
l don't know. Rob us....

259
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,480
l don't know.

260
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,080
What do we do?

261
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,160
We wait.

262
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,000
-What if they get in here?
-Well, they can't.

263
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,720
They can't get in. lt's not possible.

264
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,360
Mom. l heard you.

265
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,240
-Do you feel okay?
-Yeah.

266
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,720
-You shaky?
-No.

267
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,200
-Chills?
-No.

268
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,760
Please. Don't worry about me.

269
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,880
He's got kids. What do you think he'll do?

270
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,680
Hang out while the cops waltz in?
Use your head.

271
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,040
Here he comes.

272
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,000
l locked the roof access.
She's not getting down from there.

273
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,920
-Good.
-She could be in there calling the cops.

274
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,120
Could she have hooked it up today?

275
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,240
No. You don't just call up Bell Atlantic.

276
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:31,320
She would've had to do it through
Manhattan Security, my company.

277
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,960
l checked the paperwork
and the phone is not connected.

278
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,000
You see? She couldn't have.

279
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,880
-l thought she wouldn't be here.
-He said she wouldn't.

280
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,760
Fuck you! And fuck you!
She is not supposed--

281
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,200
Do it.

282
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,640
Excuse me.

283
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,800
The poIice are on their way.

284
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,040
-She's lying.
-You're full of--

285
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,000
lt's not an intercom. lt's a PA system.

286
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,680
l know. l'm just scaring her.

287
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:20,120
I suggest you Ieave before they get here.

288
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,480
-What?
-He's saying that we don't have a phone.

289
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,960
How could he know that?

290
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,520
Take what you want and get outI

291
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,440
lf only it were that easy.

292
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,560
Some paper. l need some paper.
Give me some paper.

293
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,600
Hey, Zorro! You going to help us out?

294
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,160
You got a piece of paper?

295
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,760
-What is he doing?
-l don't know.

296
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,720
"What we want is in that room"?

297
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,880
They're coming in here, aren't they?

298
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,400
No, no. l told you. They can't get in here.

299
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,680
What do you know about this room?

300
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,440
What do we know about that room?

301
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,840
-Let's not tell her anything.
-Just a few details.

302
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,520
We're not coming out,
and we're not letting you in!

303
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,480
Get out of my houseI

304
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,760
-Say "fuck."
-You fuck.

305
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,520
-Mom.
-What?

306
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,480
"Get the fuck out of my house."

307
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,640
Get the fuck out of my houseI

308
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,320
Okay, l have an idea.

309
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,120
She's a woman. Women need security.

310
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,920
She won't believe you.

311
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,760
She needs to know she's dealing
with decent people and she can trust us.

312
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,160
Conversation's overI

313
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,520
What? She's not coming down?

314
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,960
Shut up.
Will you please shut up and let me think?

315
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,120
Like that'll help you think.

316
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,480
You know what? Fine! You think!

317
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,640
-What if she did call the cops?
-She didn't.

318
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,760
She said it again, that she called the cops.

319
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,240
lf cops were coming,
do you think l'd still be here?

320
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,000
Okay, fine. Good, excellent.
We all believe you.

321
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,280
How do we get into that room?

322
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,320
What is funny about this?

323
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,960
ls this shit funny to you?

324
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,240
l spent the last 12 years
building these rooms...

325
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,480
...to keep out people like us.

326
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:03,240
lt's all so ironic and amusing, okay?
Now, how do we get in?

327
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,960
We can't.

328
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,600
You can't get in the panic room.

329
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,200
That's the whole point.
We have to get her to come out.

330
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,400
And why would she do that?

331
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:16,480
l don't know.

332
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,520
But when she does,
she can't get out of this house.

333
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,720
We keep her here,
we keep her quiet for 20 minutes...

334
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,840
...and l don't want any help
from Joe Pesci over here.

335
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,080
They want to hole up in this house? Fine.

336
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,560
We make it impossible for them to leave.

337
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,920
And why would they come out
in the first place?

338
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,800
l'm working on that.

339
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,760
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

340
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:57,080
Small space?

341
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,000
l'm okay.

342
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,920
-You can't wig out.
-l know.

343
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,680
-l mean it.
-l won't.

344
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,400
You know,
people never get buried alive anymore.

345
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,320
l guess it used to happen all the time.

346
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,520
Really?

347
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,120
Yeah, l read that.

348
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,520
And when did this happen all the time?

349
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,920
Twenty, thirty years ago.

350
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,680
What are they doing now?

351
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,400
l don't know.

352
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,160
They're locking us in.

353
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,600
This is not happening.

354
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,160
Sarah, calm down.

355
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,440
You know what could happen
if you let yourself get worked up.

356
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,800
Sarah!

357
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,440
-What the hell are you doing?
-We're coming in from below.

358
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,920
No, you're not. Even if you got through
the concrete, there's steel.

359
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,680
You won't even make a dent.

360
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,760
We'll see.

361
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,120
Hey. This is what l do.

362
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,120
lf some idiot with a sledgehammer
could break in...

363
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,200
...do you really think
that l would still have a job?

364
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,520
Don't get that in your eye.

365
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,680
Neighbor.

366
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,080
Help!

367
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,400
Please help us!

368
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,880
-Call the police!
-Do you hear us?

369
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,320
Help us!

370
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,680
Help!

371
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,720
-Help us, please!
-Call the police!

372
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,160
Shit!

373
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,240
You guys just going to stand there?

374
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,920
Why? What do you got, MacGyver?

375
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,840
He can't get in here with a hammer,
can he?

376
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,160
Could you be any louder?

377
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:42,000
Give me a hand with those boxes.

378
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,520
Listen, goddamn it!

379
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,040
l'm in charge here.
Now, what the hell is going on?

380
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,960
-They're going to get in here.
-No, they can't get in here.

381
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,080
We're going to be fine. We'll be just fine.

382
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,000
Oh, this is good.

383
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,040
This could work.

384
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,360
l was just thinking
that we should do something like this.

385
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:22,120
-Open it.
-l just did.

386
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,000
Open it some more.

387
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,840
We're just sending them a message.

388
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,480
They'll get the point.

389
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,520
Honey, get down on the ground.

390
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:20,040
Quit dicking around
and open this fucking thing up.

391
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,160
-Don't be stupid.
-Quiet!

392
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,760
We're trying to scare them, not kill them.

393
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:32,920
What is it?

394
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:34,600
lt's bad.

395
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:38,080
They're coughing.

396
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,600
lf they're coughing, they're going to die!

397
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,280
Nobody is going to die, man!

398
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,560
Will you please have the balls
to follow through with something?

399
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,360
Mom.

400
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:09,000
The worst that'll happen is they'll pass out.
They'll have a hangover.

401
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:12,160
How are we going to get in there
if they pass out, Junior?

402
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,880
Cut it back a little.

403
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,840
They won't pass out, numb-nuts.
They'll throw up first.

404
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,920
We can't get in if they're dead!

405
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,280
Stay on the ground and breathe.

406
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,240
Turn it down.

407
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,360
Turn it down! lt's too much!

408
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,920
-Don't you start up with this shit.
-Keep it down!

409
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,800
l'm turning it down.

410
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:52,280
-Keep his ass off of me.
-We're not killing anybody.

411
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,320
-Tell him to turn it down!
-Turn the shit off.

412
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,560
-No.
-Turn it down.

413
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:20,720
-Mom?
-Just a second.

414
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,240
Get under this.

415
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:28,960
Oh, my god.

416
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,760
-Fucking amateurs, man!
-lt's my fucking idea.

417
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,720
Shut the fuck up!
There are people trying to sleep over there.

418
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,560
What is that?

419
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:12,440
Turn the gas off.

420
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,040
Turn the gas off right now.

421
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,000
Get back!

422
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,720
Shit!

423
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:52,800
God!

424
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,160
Get it off me!

425
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:01,480
lt's okay.

426
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:08,520
You fucking bitch! You fucking bitch!
l'm coming in there!

427
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,560
Calm the fuck down.

428
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,200
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

429
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:29,000
Promise me you'll never do
anything like that.

430
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,120
l won't.

431
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:37,240
They're moving.
At least they're still moving in there.

432
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,120
What?

433
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,040
Talk to him.

434
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,280
Please, man, give it a rest.

435
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,120
-That Morse code?
-SOS.

436
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,880
Where'd you learn that?

437
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:01,360
Titanic.

438
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:14,280
We got to talk. Downstairs.

439
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,440
No, no, no. Not you.

440
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:32,000
Come on, come on, come on.

441
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,480
Get up.

442
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:36,840
Come on.

443
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:46,920
Wake up.

444
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:55,880
The first thing l'm going to do this morning
is call my plastic surgeon.

445
00:50:55,960 --> 00:51:00,760
There's been a change here.
$100,000 is not enough. Not for this shit.

446
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,800
l want a third
of whatever's in that room up there.

447
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:09,760
Fine!

448
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:14,000
Okay? Full share, one-third.
Congratulations.

449
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:18,600
You bought a ski mask, made $1,000,000.
Your parents will be proud.

450
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,280
Got him.

451
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,560
Let me straighten out something else.
Get control of your goddamn expert.

452
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,040
l'm not losing
my half of the money because--

453
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,560
Slow down. Half?

454
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,960
Did you sleep through grade school?
Five seconds ago, it was a third....

455
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,080
Come on.

456
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,120
l'm letting you know he's a problem.

457
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:05,000
But this wasn't my idea,
so he's your problem.

458
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,320
You're right. lt wasn't your idea!

459
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,480
None of this was your idea!
lt was my idea!

460
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,520
Come on, look over here.

461
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,600
Yes.

462
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,680
Yes, yes, yes.

463
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,400
Let's hope this guy's an ex-Boy Scout.

464
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,080
-We're here!
-Help us!

465
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,880
We're over here!

466
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,120
Help!

467
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:58,320
Open your window!

468
00:52:58,480 --> 00:52:59,680
Help!

469
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,080
We're never going to get out of here.

470
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:21,320
l'm the loving grandson who put in
the time with the old man...

471
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,720
...every goddamn weekend for two years...

472
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,800
...talking to him, dressing him,
walking him, feeding him.

473
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,320
Are you done?

474
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:31,560
No. l'm the one the old man
finally told about the safe.

475
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:35,360
l'm the one who found the guy who built it,
and l convinced him to break into it!

476
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:40,120
Wait a minute.

477
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:46,240
-What?
-The bedroom's empty. Where are they?

478
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:50,040
Two of them, on the stairs.

479
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,280
Where's the third guy?

480
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,080
l left my cell phone by the bed.

481
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,840
l earned that money.

482
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,520
l will not let you jeopardize
my fucking plan...

483
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:09,800
...because you have a problem
relating to others!

484
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,520
Got it?

485
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,880
lf l don't come back, close this door.

486
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,680
Just do what l say.

487
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,760
He touches me again, l'll shoot him.

488
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:22,840
Christ!

489
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,360
Wait!

490
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,920
Any other schoolyard bullshit to settle,
or can we get back to work?

491
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,240
Don't take no tone with me, jerk-wad.

492
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,160
l'll shove it up your ass and snap it off.

493
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,520
You're a bus driver, Raoul.

494
00:54:41,960 --> 00:54:43,240
You live in Flatbush.

495
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,080
Don't spout some Elmore Leonard
bullshit you just heard...

496
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,040
...because l saw that movie, too.

497
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:49,400
What is this?

498
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,960
l got some news for you.

499
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,480
Go.

500
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,080
Go!

501
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,400
Fuck!

502
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:47,880
She got something. What did she get?

503
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:49,880
No.

504
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,080
Charger!

505
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,840
She has a cell phone.

506
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,240
No!

507
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:01,400
All right, signal.

508
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:04,200
Come on. Signal.

509
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:18,560
l don't think they'll be talking
on no cell phone from in there.

510
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,120
-Why not?
-You can't call out from in there.

511
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,400
No signal.

512
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:38,280
l didn't hook up this line,
but l hooked up the main line.

513
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,800
lf we can find it, we can cut into it.

514
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:47,320
l can't go to prison, man.
l'm not built for that shit.

515
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:59,120
Be careful.

516
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,400
Get the phone.

517
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,600
-lt doesn't come off.
-Rip it off!

518
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:26,760
Screwdriver. Phillips.

519
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:38,000
Junior, when l asked you to cut
the phone lines, did you cut the main line?

520
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:41,440
Or did you just cut the cord on the phone
in the kitchen?

521
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,240
Shit!

522
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:12,200
Strip this and expose the wires.

523
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,440
-What are we doing?
-l have no idea.

524
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,880
-Okay, got it?
-Yeah. Here.

525
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,160
Okay.

526
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:47,160
Yellow, yellow.

527
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:01,840
Okay.

528
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,320
Dial tone.

529
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,240
911 emergency.

530
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:18,040
Yes, this is 38 West 94th Street--

531
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:21,200
-pIease hoId.
-No, no. God.

532
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:27,520
Call Dad.

533
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:36,080
How do you live in New York
and not have a single Percocet?

534
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:41,360
-HeIIo?
-Stephan. Put Stephan on the line.

535
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:43,240
-Who is this?
-lt's Meg.

536
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,640
Do you know what time it is?

537
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:49,160
-Put him on the phone, bitch.
-It's your fucking wife.

538
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:53,920
Move.

539
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,240
-HeIIo?
-You've got to help us.

540
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:59,240
Move!

541
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:02,600
There are three men upstairs.
They broke in--

542
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:06,760
What--

543
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:23,160
-He'll do something.
-No, he won't.

544
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,720
He'll call the police.

545
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:26,920
You don't know her. She won't let him.

546
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,400
No. He knows that there's trouble.
He heard me.

547
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,400
He's across the park. That's why
we got houses close to each other.

548
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,840
Just in case we needed each other.
He'll help us.

549
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:39,120
-He won't.
-Yes, he will!

550
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:46,120
l'm sorry.

551
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:48,440
No, l'm sorry.

552
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:50,520
Why?

553
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,760
l was trying not to tell you.

554
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:55,880
What?

555
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:58,400
l'm dizzy and hungry.

556
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:04,640
All she's got is NyQuil and fucking Midol.

557
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:09,360
Looks like that gas idea
didn't work so well.

558
01:02:10,080 --> 01:02:11,400
Whose fault was that?

559
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:12,840
This is impossible.

560
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:14,640
What's the plan now, hot rod?

561
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:17,320
This is worse than impossible.
This is unpleasant.

562
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:22,000
Here, drink this.
All right, drink lots of water.

563
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:25,920
You dropped to the low 40s.
We have to get your blood-sugar up.

564
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,440
Can you hear me okay?

565
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:29,240
l'm just dizzy, not deaf.

566
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:32,280
Great. Smart ass. That's excellent.

567
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,480
Did you see anything in here?
Any candy bars or something sweet?

568
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:38,200
Let's check it again.

569
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:39,640
Mom, l did it.

570
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:41,800
We got to stay calm, okay?

571
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:44,960
lf we stay calm, everything will be fine.
All right? Stay calm.

572
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:46,520
You're making me nervous.

573
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,320
l'm sorry.

574
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,360
What if l keep dropping?

575
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:55,320
You won't. l'll figure something out.

576
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,440
You know, he's right.

577
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:02,520
There's no way
we're getting into that room.

578
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:04,120
What are you talking about?

579
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,200
l just got to be honest with myself here.

580
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,520
l don't need to be involved...

581
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:14,280
...with anything so harrowing
or perilous at this point in my life.

582
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:17,120
-You're giving up?
-Hell, yes.

583
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:20,840
l don't need the fucking aggravation.
l'll make an anonymous phone call.

584
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:24,920
They'll find the floor safe. l'll inherit.

585
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:27,720
Stephen, Jeffrey, Catherine, David.

586
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:31,200
Five grandkids, 60 percent inheritance tax.

587
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:35,320
Fuck, l'll still put away 8 or 900 grand
and keep my goddamn hair.

588
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:39,080
Take it. Go out and get loaded.

589
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,640
Wait a minute.

590
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,680
Say what you just said again.

591
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:53,000
Say that shit about the money
again, babycakes.

592
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,400
When? Before?

593
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:58,960
Yeah, before.

594
01:03:59,080 --> 01:04:02,600
Splitting the money in your head,
you said you'd put away 800 or 900 grand.

595
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,520
What are you doing?

596
01:04:05,640 --> 01:04:09,440
That was after tax, which makes it more
than a million and a half gross.

597
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:13,040
So now you're a tax attorney.

598
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:18,720
-l'm out of here.
-Wait a minute.

599
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:23,240
There's sugar in everything.
Places you'd never expect. Like ketchup.

600
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:24,840
Where else?

601
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:29,240
Travel kit.

602
01:04:29,360 --> 01:04:32,000
Plus, you named eight people
you got to split it with...

603
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:34,520
...so that's 10 or 12 million bucks
in the safe.

604
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:37,720
A fuck-up like you has got to get less
than everybody else...

605
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,720
...so now l don't know what to think.

606
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:42,560
You're adding up money
you'll never touch, buddy.

607
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:45,480
How much is in there?

608
01:04:47,600 --> 01:04:48,960
Mouthwash.

609
01:04:49,840 --> 01:04:50,720
Saccharin.

610
01:04:53,600 --> 01:04:56,080
Hey, l'm talking to you. Answer me.

611
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:57,880
Fine. There's more.

612
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:01,560
And when were you going to tell us
this minor economic detail?

613
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,960
lt doesn't matter now.
lt's totally fucking moot!

614
01:05:04,840 --> 01:05:07,760
-Why are we having this conversation?
-What were you thinking?

615
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:10,200
How did you expect to get away with this?

616
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,320
Did you think that l'd open that safe...

617
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:15,600
...and then me and Raoul would wait
while you picked out your share?

618
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:18,280
What's the matter with you?

619
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:21,280
You got us into this mess,
and you were going to fuck us?

620
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:24,800
You got yourself into this.
You got the custody lawyers up your ass.

621
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,560
Your eyes were huge
when l told you about the gig...

622
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,000
...so don't play innocent.

623
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:31,480
Things didn't work out.

624
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:34,400
Play past it.

625
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,320
Mints? Sugar-free.

626
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:42,040
Mints? Sugar-free.

627
01:05:42,160 --> 01:05:45,520
l'm opening that safe.
You leave, you get nothing.

628
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:47,440
lt's looking doubtful there, big guy.

629
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:51,200
l will split the money with Raoul.
But l don't ever want to see you again.

630
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:54,880
Cops show up on my doorstep,
we will know who sent them...

631
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:57,120
...and we will fucking find you.

632
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:02,760
l'll see you, Burnham.

633
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,160
Later, Raoul.

634
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:12,320
Mom!

635
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:23,880
Ride in a Town Car to 125th Street
a couple of times...

636
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,080
...think you know all about it.

637
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:30,920
You don't know nothing about me.

638
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:34,800
Sarah, listen to me:

639
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:37,760
Go to the corner. Shut your eyes
and don't turn around.

640
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:38,880
Okay.

641
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:45,640
You should see the look on your face.

642
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:48,200
What's happening?

643
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:51,640
-Don't move. Don't you fucking move.
-No, don't.

-Stop it, you fucking--

Clown? ldiot? Fucking asshole?

Me.

652
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:19,240
That's right.

653
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:21,440
lt's burning me.

654
01:07:21,680 --> 01:07:22,880
Who's got the gun?

655
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:24,560
You.

656
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:26,720
Remember that.

657
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,800
Find out who the fuck that is.

658
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:34,880
Give me your wallet.

659

Stephan Altman.

661
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:52,800
Did your wife give you a call, Stephan?

662
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:56,800
What did she say?

663
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:01,640
Don't know. Cut off.

664
01:08:01,840 --> 01:08:04,360
-Phones are dead.
-Did you call anybody else?

665
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:09,480
Did you call the fucking cops, Stephan?

666
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:13,800
No.

667
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:15,960
He's telling the truth.

668
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:18,160
Yeah.

669
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:19,960
Yeah, he probably is.

Because when l do this, people don't lie.

671

You're full of ideas.
You just got to squeeze one out.

675
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,040
You want me to just make something up?

676
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:37,200
You've got till the count of three.

677
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:39,680
Then you end up like Junior over there.

01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:44,720
-One, squeeze.
-This is ridiculous.

679
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:45,880
Two, squeeze.

680
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,520

681
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:48,720
-Three.
-Wait!

682
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:50,480

01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:02,600
Maybe.

686
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:06,040

No, no.

You kill him, they'll never open that door.

702
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:28,480
Oh, god.

703

You'll be fine. Come on.

Get your hands off him,

01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,320
Yeah, that's it. That's it.

714
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:28,200

and step away from the door.

744

You got to open the door.
My daughter is very sick.

745
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:42,400
She needs an injection.

746
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:44,680
Do you hear me?

747
01:16:45,040 --> 01:16:47,240

Can you do this yourself?

754
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:26,800
What happens if you don't get it?

755
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:29,480
Coma.

While we're in here, she'll call the cops.

774
01:19:17,680 --> 01:19:19,520
Are you going to open the safe?

775
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,600
Don't you look at me.

776
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:41,200
All l know about this is what l see on TV.

Dad's rich. Mom's just mad.

lt's not that l didn't try.

787
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:57,560
Sometimes things, they don't work out
the way you want them to.

788
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:02,320
Done.

789

01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:08,680
He had it all worked out.

791
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:11,440
Nobody was supposed to even be here.

792
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:15,280
Thanks...

793
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:17,600
...Burnham.

794

Wasn't supposed to be like this.

795
01:21:29,520 --> 01:21:31,000
She's going to be okay.

796
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:34,200
I gave her the shot. She's aII right.

797
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:36,400

Stephan.

799
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:00,800
Oh, my god.

Can you move?

801
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:09,640
Not much. l think my arm is broken.

802
01:22:29,160 --> 01:22:30,400
Raise your arm.

803
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:32,680
Come on, raise your arm.

804
01:22:50,120 --> 01:22:51,400
Try again.

805
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:54,000
Come on. Try again.

806
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,560
Meg, please don't do anything stupid.

807
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:04,200
They're going to kill us.

808
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:07,000
Just do everything they ask.
lt'll be okay that way.

809
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:09,800
Stephan, they'll kill her.

810
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:25,840
Holy shit. She called the goddamn cops.

811
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,360
The police.

812
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:29,640
You called the police?

813
01:23:29,720 --> 01:23:31,480
Of course, l called them.

814
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:33,520
You scared the shit out of me.

815
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:35,120
She killed the kid.

816
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:38,240
She just killed her own kid.

817
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:40,640
All right, take this.

818
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:43,200
Don't say a word.

819
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:50,080
No, her husband must have called them.

820
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:52,840
Foreign son of a bitch. l told you!

821
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:55,680
Where is she?

822
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:00,680
There.

823
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:03,400
What the fuck's she doing?

824
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:21,000
She's going to handle it.

825
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:26,880
l'm just trying to unlock....

826
01:24:32,920 --> 01:24:35,760
-ls everything okay?
-You all right, ma'am?

827
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:39,880
What are you.... What time is it?

828
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:43,120
lt's a little after 4:00 a.m.

829
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:44,960
We got a call, ma'am.

830
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:47,520
Somebody called you?

831
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:50,440
Can we come in?

832
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:52,040
What do you want?

833
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:55,200
-We'd like to come in.
-No, you can't come in.

834
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:57,480
Ma'am, you sure you're all right?

835
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:59,360
l'm fine.

836
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:02,480
Ma'am, you don't look so good.

837
01:25:10,520 --> 01:25:13,880
Well, you don't look so hot yourself,
Officer Keeney.

838
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:17,920
Come on, l'm freezing out here.

839
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:21,960
"There are three."

840
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:24,240
What?

841
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:27,480
Your husband said you called for help.

842
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:31,320
That you said, "There are three"
right before you got cut off.

843
01:25:34,800 --> 01:25:36,360
Oh, that phone call.

844
01:25:36,720 --> 01:25:38,720
And your neighbors...

845
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:43,400
...called in about some loud shouts
or a loudspeaker of some kind?

846
01:25:46,160 --> 01:25:48,000
That was the TV. lt's off now.

847
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:52,760
Can l just ask you one question?

848
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:56,040
What was the end of that sentence?

849
01:25:58,880 --> 01:26:00,960
When you said, "There are three"...

850
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:03,520
...what was the rest?

851
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:08,920
Look....

852
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:14,560
My husband and l just split up...

853
01:26:15,200 --> 01:26:18,440
...and it's my first night in a new house...

854
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:21,880
...and l admit l was a little drunk.

855
01:26:23,160 --> 01:26:26,440
And the sentence,
if you insist on knowing...

856
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:29,040
...was going to be:

857
01:26:31,240 --> 01:26:35,720
"There are three things that l'll do for you
if you come jump into bed with me."

858
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:44,200
Thank God l came to my senses
before l said all that, and l hung up...

859
01:26:44,880 --> 01:26:47,840
...so nobody would ever have to know
what l was thinking.

860
01:26:47,920 --> 01:26:49,320
Unless, of course...

861
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:53,720
...two policemen came in the middle
of the night and interrogated me.

862
01:26:57,920 --> 01:26:59,560
So, Rick, you want to go?

863
01:27:00,120 --> 01:27:02,800
Or do you want her to tell you
which three things?

864
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:08,000
All right.

865
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:09,280
Ma'am...

866
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:15,320
...if there's something you want
to say to us...

867
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:19,880
...but maybe you can't say it right now...

868
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:25,160
...you might want to make some kind
of a signal...

869
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:28,520
...by blinking your eyes a few times.

870
01:27:30,080 --> 01:27:31,720
Something like that.

871
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:38,600
That's something you could do safely.

872
01:27:48,040 --> 01:27:48,960
Man...

873
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:52,080
...you guys are good.

874
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:57,280
You mean, like if there was somebody
in the house or something?

875
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:01,600
They really train you guys.

876
01:28:05,400 --> 01:28:07,760
No, l'm fine. l'm fine. Cross my heart.

877
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:19,080
Sorry to disturb you, ma'am.

878
01:28:19,960 --> 01:28:21,160
'Night, ma'am.

879
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:36,240
This kid has seen my face.

880
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:38,960
Yeah, well, that's not my problem.

881
01:28:39,240 --> 01:28:42,000
Yeah, it is. You're here with me.

882
01:28:42,640 --> 01:28:44,160
You're on the hook, too.

883
01:28:45,040 --> 01:28:48,120
Do one. Same price for the rest.

884
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:53,640
Stay the fuck away from me.

885
01:28:56,560 --> 01:28:58,440
You know how this is going to end.

886
01:30:11,400 --> 01:30:12,320
Goddamn!

887
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:48,760
What's up?

888
01:31:01,840 --> 01:31:03,680
Why the hell didn't we do that?

889
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:12,600
What's she doing?
What the fuck does she think she's doing?

890
01:31:12,720 --> 01:31:16,480
She's got your gun.
Who told you to bring a gun?

891
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:20,880
Just let me drill, man.

892
01:33:01,200 --> 01:33:02,320
Empty?

893
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:04,760
Come on, man.

894

Bank bonds.

895
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:36,520
One second.

896

Two, three, four, five....

897
01:33:41,520 --> 01:33:43,040
Why are we doing this?

898
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:46,560
Because it's going to come to that.

899
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:51,040
There are 22.

900

Leave that. Christ, l'll buy you new tools.

905
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:22,680
You'll be okay.

Get down here.

910
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:48,280
Wait.

911

Wait. You don't want to do that.

912
01:37:51,520 --> 01:37:52,960
Dad, don't shoot him!

913
01:37:55,640 --> 01:37:57,000

We're finished. Your daughter's fine.

915
01:38:01,360 --> 01:38:04,440
We'll go out the back door.
You'll never see us again.

916
