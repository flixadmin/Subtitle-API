1
00:00:02,698 --> 00:00:04,047
Previously,
on <i>Legends of Tomorrow…</i>

2
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:05,222
Come with us.
The choice is yours.

3
00:00:05,266 --> 00:00:07,224
What's next for you, love?

4
00:00:07,268 --> 00:00:09,835
I guess I'll give life
above ground a fair shot.

5
00:00:09,879 --> 00:00:12,186
Aha.

6
00:00:12,229 --> 00:00:13,752
Finally.

7
00:00:13,796 --> 00:00:15,276
I think this is the
end of the line for me.

8
00:00:15,319 --> 00:00:17,582
- Ah, get in here.
- Aww.

9
00:00:17,626 --> 00:00:18,844
Whoo.

10
00:00:36,732 --> 00:00:38,603
Piss off, you bloody guv'nor!

11
00:01:08,503 --> 00:01:11,245
Punks, can't handle their liquor.

12
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:18,469
- Is that the ocean?
- No.

13
00:01:18,513 --> 00:01:19,992
And you look like garbage.

14
00:01:20,036 --> 00:01:22,125
I feel like garbage.

15
00:01:22,169 --> 00:01:23,866
Why don't you, huh?

16
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:25,476
Where the hell were you last night?

17
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,087
I dropped Lita off at her mom's.

18
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,436
Oh.

19
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,265
Well, aren't you just a good dad, huh?

20
00:01:31,308 --> 00:01:32,788
Ow.

21
00:01:32,831 --> 00:01:34,746
Hey.

22
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,140
How come nobody tucked me into bed, huh?

23
00:01:37,184 --> 00:01:39,011
- You're asking me?
- Yeah.

24
00:01:39,055 --> 00:01:41,927
- Where's Sara?
- Don't know.

25
00:01:42,972 --> 00:01:44,452
Oh.

26
00:01:44,495 --> 00:01:46,410
What do you—
Gideon, where's Sara?

27
00:01:46,454 --> 00:01:49,021
<i>Sara Lance is not
on board the Waverider.</i>

28
00:01:50,893 --> 00:01:52,068
Sara's missing?

29
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,461
Everyone's missing.

30
00:01:54,679 --> 00:01:56,246
Gideon, who is on board?

31
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:59,293
<i>Ava Sharpe, Mick Rory,
and several punks.</i>

32
00:01:59,336 --> 00:02:01,164
Uh, where could they be?

33
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:02,731
Skyemont.

34
00:02:02,774 --> 00:02:05,342
- Why do you say that?
- It's on your hand.

35
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:09,651
Mick, you're a genius.

36
00:02:09,694 --> 00:02:11,000
Maybe it's from Sara.
Let's go.

37
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,572
Oh, God. Okay.
No, no, no, no, no.

38
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:35,067
London, 1977.

39
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:38,941
The tangled knot of grime,
the stodgy monarchy.

40
00:02:38,984 --> 00:02:41,378
This collision of punk rock
and aristocracy

41
00:02:41,422 --> 00:02:44,468
slamming into each other
like two doomed worlds, this—

42
00:02:44,512 --> 00:02:46,992
This is a lot at 7:00 a.m.,
John.

43
00:02:48,951 --> 00:02:50,648
I'm glad you're
in a good mood though.

44
00:02:50,692 --> 00:02:52,041
Well, why shouldn't I be?

45
00:02:52,084 --> 00:02:54,957
You see, my soul
finally belongs to me.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,437
Astra is redeemed,

47
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,222
and—

48
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:02,225
I get to wake up next to you,
you lovely creature.

49
00:03:02,269 --> 00:03:03,313
Mm.

50
00:03:03,357 --> 00:03:05,620
How are you feeling?

51
00:03:05,663 --> 00:03:09,058
I think a no-strings-attached
hookup every now and then

52
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:11,103
is good for the soul.

53
00:03:11,147 --> 00:03:12,844
Even if it's with a guy
whose only coat

54
00:03:12,888 --> 00:03:14,585
smells like booze
and cigarettes.

55
00:03:16,108 --> 00:03:18,502
Ugh.
Oh, hel-lo.

56
00:03:18,546 --> 00:03:20,069
Oh.
Sorry, guys.

57
00:03:20,112 --> 00:03:21,766
You, uh, missed the party.

58
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,115
Wait, are you two—

59
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,900
- Yeah.
- Uh-oh.

60
00:03:27,294 --> 00:03:29,209
Okay, sorry.
I'm not judging, I just—

61
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:30,732
it's none of my business.
I'm fine.

62
00:03:32,821 --> 00:03:34,170
It's an involuntary reaction.

63
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,302
We should burn the room.

64
00:03:35,345 --> 00:03:36,477
Hey, at least we know

65
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,043
how to use protection, Pops.

66
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,003
Do either of you know
where Sara is?

67
00:03:41,046 --> 00:03:43,527
Uh, we seem to have
lost track of her.

68
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:47,401
Oh.
Someone did hand me this.

69
00:03:47,444 --> 00:03:49,664
Is this anything?

70
00:03:51,492 --> 00:03:53,276
I call.

71
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:00,109
Full house, fellas.

72
00:04:00,152 --> 00:04:01,676
That's three in a row.

73
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:04,200
She's a shady card sharp.

74
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,333
Oh, no.
Just lucky.

75
00:04:09,771 --> 00:04:11,207
What about now?

76
00:04:15,777 --> 00:04:18,910
Still lucky
and now also richer.

77
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:25,874
I just love toying
with these poor mortals.

78
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:28,790
Oh, yeah, well you are one of
these poor mortals now, love.

79
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,226
Try remembering that
the next time

80
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,488
you come across one
with a gun, yeah?

81
00:04:31,532 --> 00:04:33,273
Astra, have you seen Sara?

82
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:35,753
Uh, not recently.
Maybe ask Behrad.

83
00:04:35,797 --> 00:04:37,538
Yeah, where is my brother?

84
00:04:37,581 --> 00:04:40,236
I can't believe how much
we have in common.

85
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,543
It's like we're riding
the same cosmic vibe, you know?

86
00:04:42,586 --> 00:04:44,327
We just click.

87
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:47,722
It's like we were destined
to connect in this moment.

88
00:04:47,765 --> 00:04:49,114
Hey, wrap it up Behrad.

89
00:04:49,158 --> 00:04:50,725
We gonna pick this up later.

90
00:04:50,768 --> 00:04:52,292
Cheerio.

91
00:04:52,335 --> 00:04:53,858
Hey.
Have you seen Sara?

92
00:04:53,902 --> 00:04:54,990
- No.
- Ugh!

93
00:04:55,033 --> 00:04:56,165
Maybe she's with Nate.

94
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:57,601
He was headed back to the club.

95
00:04:57,645 --> 00:04:59,168
Back?
Why?

96
00:04:59,211 --> 00:05:01,344
We met Starman
at the after-after.

97
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:03,172
Said he had to prep
for his show there tonight.

98
00:05:03,215 --> 00:05:05,130
What the hell's a Starman?

99
00:05:05,174 --> 00:05:07,307
Major T?

100
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,831
Ziggy Stardust?

101
00:05:09,874 --> 00:05:11,006
Bowie!

102
00:05:11,049 --> 00:05:13,313
He's talking about David Bowie.

103
00:05:15,532 --> 00:05:17,969
See, my girlfriend's
from another time.

104
00:05:18,013 --> 00:05:19,319
Oh, like the future.

105
00:05:19,362 --> 00:05:20,842
No.
Well…

106
00:05:20,885 --> 00:05:22,974
technically, yes,
but she's from the future

107
00:05:23,018 --> 00:05:25,760
with a different
timeline entirely.

108
00:05:25,803 --> 00:05:27,849
Now she lives in a Totem.

109
00:05:27,892 --> 00:05:31,766
And I'm forced
to be at peace with it.

110
00:05:31,809 --> 00:05:34,203
What's her name?

111
00:05:34,246 --> 00:05:36,074
Zari.

112
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:39,339
Her name is Zari.

113
00:05:39,382 --> 00:05:42,385
And I'm afraid I'm never
gonna see her again.

114
00:05:43,821 --> 00:05:45,127
Hi, Zari.

115
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,520
Hey, guys.
This is David Bowie.

116
00:05:46,563 --> 00:05:47,999
Marvelous.

117
00:05:48,043 --> 00:05:49,044
Okay, Nate.
We're looking for Sara.

118
00:05:49,087 --> 00:05:50,567
Is she here with you?

119
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:53,396
Last time I saw her
was at the concert.

120
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,397

124
00:06:02,536 --> 00:06:03,972
Did he just say
"disappeared"?

125
00:06:04,015 --> 00:06:05,669
Sara disappeared.
Is he singing about Sara?

126
00:06:05,713 --> 00:06:07,932
Deh, deh, deh— do not
interrupt David's process.

127
00:06:07,976 --> 00:06:10,718
He's trying to cheer me up
by singing a song about Zari.

128
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:13,938
- 1.0, not you.
- Obviously.

129
00:06:13,982 --> 00:06:15,984

Hey, listen, mate.

138
00:06:31,521 --> 00:06:32,566
Is that song you're singing

139
00:06:32,609 --> 00:06:34,394
about Nate's sad love life?

140
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:35,612
No, mate.

141
00:06:35,656 --> 00:06:36,918
Are you singing
about Sara Lance?

142
00:06:36,961 --> 00:06:38,310
Is that her name?

143
00:06:38,354 --> 00:06:39,703
Your friend who got sucked up

144
00:06:39,747 --> 00:06:41,096
into a spaceship?

145
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:43,664
W— sucked into a spaceship?

146
00:06:43,707 --> 00:06:44,926
Isn't it wild?

147
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:46,797
So you saw this
with your own

148
00:06:46,841 --> 00:06:50,192
beautiful, asymmetrical eyes?

149
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:53,935
I was filming that night
on my Super 8.

150
00:06:53,978 --> 00:06:55,066
See for yourself.

151
00:06:58,548 --> 00:07:00,463
Okay.
Film is developed.

152
00:07:00,507 --> 00:07:02,465
Let's see what Bowie saw.

153
00:07:04,162 --> 00:07:06,861
<i>♪ Welcome to my cul-de-sac,
friend ♪</i>

154

<i>♪ That's a street

155
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:13,433
<i>You lads are out
of this world.</i>

156
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:16,174
<i>David freaking Bowie?</i>

157
00:07:16,218 --> 00:07:19,047
- <i>You're a Smell fan?</i>
- <i>They're something else.</i>

158
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:21,179
<i>Hey, wait, wait, wait.
I gotta— I gotta let you in</i>

159
00:07:21,223 --> 00:07:23,181
<i>on a little secret, all right,

00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,213
<i>She's a space girl.</i>

166
00:07:57,564 --> 00:07:58,608
- Ava—
- Okay.

167
00:07:58,652 --> 00:08:01,655
Um, Sara's been abducted so,

168
00:08:01,698 --> 00:08:04,353
uh, Sara's been abducted.

169
00:08:04,396 --> 00:08:06,660
Uh …ll be right back.

170
00:08:10,925 --> 00:08:12,535
So she's a mess.

171
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:14,494
All right, so let's just
give her some space.

172
00:08:14,537 --> 00:08:16,800
In the meantime,
what do we know about aliens?

173
00:08:16,844 --> 00:08:18,106
Literally nothing.

174
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:19,368
They're green.

175
00:08:19,411 --> 00:08:20,804
Listen, you fools.

176
00:08:20,848 --> 00:08:22,197
Sara's missing

177
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,981
because you guys
were partying last night.

178
00:08:24,025 --> 00:08:26,941
We have to find her.
We're running out of time.

179
00:09:35,705 --> 00:09:37,141
<i>Time to get organized.</i>

180
00:09:37,185 --> 00:09:39,970
- Ava, you're back.
- Mm-hmm.

181
00:09:40,014 --> 00:09:41,450
Oh.
Whoa.

182
00:09:41,493 --> 00:09:42,712
Here you go.

183
00:09:42,756 --> 00:09:43,887
- Girl, are you okay?
- What?

184
00:09:43,931 --> 00:09:45,585
I'm fine.
Why?

185
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:46,934
Well, we just thought that—

186
00:09:46,977 --> 00:09:48,457
You know,
with Sara being lost,

187
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,980
you may wanna sit this one out.

188
00:09:50,024 --> 00:09:52,548
Uh, she is not lost.
She is pre-found.

189
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,332
There's a solution to every
problem including this one.

190
00:09:54,376 --> 00:09:56,291
Wow, indexed.
Thorough.

191
00:09:56,334 --> 00:09:57,858
You are all
the best of the best.

192
00:09:57,901 --> 00:09:59,990
If we handle this logically
and rationally,

193
00:10:00,034 --> 00:10:01,513
we will get Sara back, okay?

194
00:10:01,557 --> 00:10:03,733
Right, well, uh,
this a waste of time.

195
00:10:03,777 --> 00:10:05,779
- I've got a better idea.
- Oh?

196
00:10:05,822 --> 00:10:07,650
Yeah, ever since
I rescued her from Purgatory,

197
00:10:07,694 --> 00:10:10,174
Sara and I have
a psychic connection.

198
00:10:10,218 --> 00:10:11,654
It'll allow me to locate her,

199
00:10:11,698 --> 00:10:13,047
and everything I need
is at the mansion.

200
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:14,657
Damn it, John.
That's insubordinate.

201
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:17,007
But I won't try to stop you.

202
00:10:17,051 --> 00:10:18,661
You know, he's actually
most effective

203
00:10:18,705 --> 00:10:20,097
not left to his own devices.

204
00:10:20,141 --> 00:10:21,751
- I can just—
- Thank you, Z.

205
00:10:21,795 --> 00:10:23,710
- We're gonna fix this.
- Mm-hmm.

206
00:10:26,321 --> 00:10:28,149
Astra, would you mind keeping
them on mission please?

207
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:31,805
Uh, I'm not really
on the team, so…

208
00:10:31,848 --> 00:10:33,284
We're accepting outside help.
Thank you.

209
00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:38,855
Okay. I think I need
to just calm down

210
00:10:38,899 --> 00:10:40,683
and do some "research."

211
00:10:40,727 --> 00:10:41,684
Really?
Right now?

212
00:10:41,728 --> 00:10:42,859
Dude, Sara needs us!

213
00:10:42,903 --> 00:10:44,252
I'm freaking out here, man.

214
00:10:44,295 --> 00:10:46,689
Aw, come on, B.

215
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:48,256
Ah, Mick.
Perfect timing.

216
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:49,953
I need you to check
on any leads you may have

217
00:10:49,997 --> 00:10:51,128
in the underworld please.

218
00:10:51,172 --> 00:10:52,521
Not gonna work.

219
00:10:52,564 --> 00:10:54,523
This whole thing's
not gonna work.

220
00:10:54,566 --> 00:10:56,481
Nothing works without Sara.

221
00:10:56,525 --> 00:10:58,135
Okay, so what?
Are you just gonna drink?

222
00:10:58,179 --> 00:10:59,615
That's real mature, Rory.

223
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,922
Real mature.

224
00:11:01,965 --> 00:11:03,140
Wow. You really got this team
figured out.

225
00:11:03,184 --> 00:11:04,794
- Mm-hmm.
- So what do we do?

226
00:11:04,838 --> 00:11:06,535
Uh, we are gonna call
the experts, the D.E.O.

227
00:11:06,578 --> 00:11:09,103
- Good idea. Eesh—
- What?

228
00:11:09,146 --> 00:11:11,322
Is it gonna get weird
between you and Alex Danvers

229
00:11:11,366 --> 00:11:13,237
'cause she and Sara
had a fling?

230
00:11:13,281 --> 00:11:16,414
It's— swing a dead cat.
Sara never liked to be alone.

231
00:11:47,663 --> 00:11:49,012
Are you okay?

232
00:11:52,059 --> 00:11:54,061
Whoa.

233
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:55,540
Who are you?

234
00:11:55,584 --> 00:11:58,500
I'm Spartacus,
the Undefeatable.

235
00:11:58,543 --> 00:12:00,763
Oh.
Yeah, that "undefeatable" part

236
00:12:00,807 --> 00:12:02,547
didn't quite stick, but…

237
00:12:04,636 --> 00:12:07,378
Uh, wait.

238
00:12:07,422 --> 00:12:08,989
Hey, get back here!

239
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:28,878
Sorry.
Did you find Sara?

240
00:12:28,922 --> 00:12:31,141
No.

241
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:33,100
Care to wet your whistle?

242
00:12:33,143 --> 00:12:35,580
I'm confused.
What did you learn?

243
00:12:35,624 --> 00:12:37,931
That Sara Lance is

244
00:12:37,974 --> 00:12:39,454
far beyond my reach.

245
00:12:39,497 --> 00:12:41,935
You told Ava
you could reach her.

246
00:12:41,978 --> 00:12:43,806
Yeah, well, I overpromised.

247
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,677
You can't just give up
on Sara.

248
00:12:45,721 --> 00:12:47,418
There's got to be
something you can do.

249
00:12:47,462 --> 00:12:48,811
- Come on. Anything?
- Look—

250
00:12:48,855 --> 00:12:51,640
aliens took her, all right?
To space.

251
00:12:51,683 --> 00:12:54,512
This is really not my area
of expertise.

252
00:12:54,556 --> 00:12:55,992
Now if it was a ghost,
or a demon,

253
00:12:56,036 --> 00:12:57,559
or even a handle of whiskey,

254
00:12:57,602 --> 00:13:00,301
I could help you out
with that, but I'm sorry.

255
00:13:00,344 --> 00:13:02,825
All right?
I'm an astrologer.

256
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:05,915
And you need an astronomer.

257
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:07,482
What an ass.

258
00:13:07,525 --> 00:13:10,180
Yeah, he does have
that going for him.

259
00:13:10,224 --> 00:13:12,008
Look, he's right.

260
00:13:12,052 --> 00:13:13,793
This is out of his league.

261
00:13:13,836 --> 00:13:15,707
This is out of all our leagues.

262
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:18,014
I disagree.

263
00:13:18,058 --> 00:13:21,148
Astra, let's talk
about your "network."

264
00:13:21,191 --> 00:13:23,672
My network?

265
00:13:23,715 --> 00:13:25,935
I've been on Earth
for, like, five minutes.

266
00:13:25,979 --> 00:13:27,807
Exactly.

267
00:13:32,681 --> 00:13:34,509
<i>Gideon, why isn't
the D.E.O. answering?</i>

268
00:13:34,552 --> 00:13:36,424
<i>The Department
of Extranormal Operations</i>

269
00:13:36,467 --> 00:13:39,427
<i>was destroyed in the infamous
year 2020 by Rama Khan.</i>

270
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:42,256
Nate, this is a huge setback.

271
00:13:42,299 --> 00:13:44,519
We needed the D.E.O.
Aliens is their jurisdiction.

272
00:13:44,562 --> 00:13:46,129
- Yeah.

273
00:13:46,173 --> 00:13:47,739
<i>Captain Sharpe,
I believe we are dealing</i>

274
00:13:47,783 --> 00:13:49,263
<i>with a temporal anomaly.</i>

275
00:13:49,306 --> 00:13:50,830
<i>According to
the original timeline,</i>

276
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:52,135
<i>there was no alien spacecraft</i>

277
00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:53,963
<i>over London in 1977.</i>

278
00:13:54,007 --> 00:13:56,923
Meaning this is
our jurisdiction.

279
00:13:56,966 --> 00:13:59,099
- Huh?
- We're the experts.

280
00:13:59,142 --> 00:14:00,230
No.

281
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:02,145
We're— we're the experts?

282
00:14:02,189 --> 00:14:03,233
Damn right we are.

283
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:04,974
You, me, the Legends.

284
00:14:05,018 --> 00:14:06,367
We're the only people
who are capable

285
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,282
of handling
time-traveling aliens.

286
00:14:08,325 --> 00:14:10,110
Nate, if I trusted the team,

287
00:14:10,153 --> 00:14:12,329
I wouldn't have made an entire
binder to get rid of them.

288
00:14:12,373 --> 00:14:14,636
Okay?
The D.E.O. was plan A.

289
00:14:14,679 --> 00:14:17,160
Well, Ava, you are now
in charge of the Legends.

290
00:14:17,204 --> 00:14:19,249
So welcome to plan B.

291
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:20,555
Now breathe it in.

292
00:14:20,598 --> 00:14:21,556
- Breathe with me.
- No.

293
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:22,557
Come.

294
00:14:24,298 --> 00:14:25,908
Plan B smells like pot.

295
00:14:25,952 --> 00:14:27,301
I got something.

296
00:14:27,344 --> 00:14:28,911
You are a walking
contact high.

297
00:14:28,955 --> 00:14:31,740
You're welcome.
Gideon, put this up.

298
00:14:32,567 --> 00:14:33,916
That's a cute little kid.

299
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,178
B, that's a tabloid.

300
00:14:35,222 --> 00:14:36,788
Yes, tabloids
help me not think

301
00:14:36,832 --> 00:14:38,486
about how we live
on a technological terror

302
00:14:38,529 --> 00:14:40,662
hurtling through
a swirling green nightmare.

303
00:14:40,705 --> 00:14:42,142
Damn.

304
00:14:42,185 --> 00:14:44,709
So this girl,
Esperanza Cruz,

305
00:14:44,753 --> 00:14:47,582
says that she was abducted
by aliens,

306
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:50,280
and from then on, she could
communicate with them.

307
00:14:50,324 --> 00:14:52,326
They implanted something
in her head.

308
00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:53,849
B!

309
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,503
I'm s— this is a tabloid, okay?

310
00:14:55,546 --> 00:14:56,939
From how— what, 20 years ago?

311
00:14:56,983 --> 00:14:58,375
It's probably
totally fabricated.

312
00:14:58,419 --> 00:15:00,638
- I need real leads.
- She's real, man.

313
00:15:00,682 --> 00:15:03,380
- Gideon located her.
- I mean…

314
00:15:03,424 --> 00:15:05,034
little kid
with alien tech in her head.

315
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:06,209
Not a bad lead.

316
00:15:06,253 --> 00:15:08,385
Okay, sure.
Fine.

317
00:15:08,429 --> 00:15:10,474
You know? Whatever.
It's all we've got.

318
00:15:10,518 --> 00:15:12,302
I mean, Rory's probably
good and boozed up by now,

319
00:15:12,346 --> 00:15:13,825
so why don't you take Micky

320
00:15:13,869 --> 00:15:15,523
and go investigate
this Esperanza—

321
00:15:15,566 --> 00:15:17,264
- what is her last name?
- Uh, Cruz.

322
00:15:17,307 --> 00:15:19,179
Are we really sure bringing
Mick to talk to a kid

323
00:15:19,222 --> 00:15:21,572
- is, like, best practices?
- No, n—

324
00:15:21,616 --> 00:15:23,444
You're gonna go see her
present day.

325
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:25,098
Some of us are still trying
not to mess with the timeline.

326
00:15:25,141 --> 00:15:27,404
Right.
The timeline.

327
00:15:27,448 --> 00:15:29,319
Aye-aye.

328
00:15:29,363 --> 00:15:30,973
You're excused.

329
00:15:31,017 --> 00:15:32,453
Ugh!

330
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,723
- What is it?
- I was confined to one

331
00:15:41,766 --> 00:15:43,072
of these glass prisons.

332
00:15:43,116 --> 00:15:44,552
You were as well.

333
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:46,467
Which means there
are also others inside.

334
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:48,991
You just figured
that out now?

335
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:50,036
I did.

336
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,515
I also commanded an army

337
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:53,430
of 120,000 slaves,
gladiators, and peasants

338
00:15:53,474 --> 00:15:54,866
against the Roman republic.

339
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,956
- Yeah, I've heard.
- Mm, excellent.

340
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:58,696
Then we'll liberate
our fellow prisoners

341
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,655
and we'll lead a rebellion
against our captors.

342
00:16:00,698 --> 00:16:02,483
Wait, no.
We don't know who's in there.

343
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,227
Rise, compatriot.

344
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:10,317
I am your savior.
I am Spartacus!

345
00:16:20,283 --> 00:16:22,851
What, pray tell, are you?

346
00:16:22,894 --> 00:16:24,809
A Saxon?

347
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:26,986
Nope, that's definitely
an alien.

348
00:16:48,398 --> 00:16:50,009
Hey, a little help here!

349
00:17:15,338 --> 00:17:16,818
The thrill of the battle.

350
00:17:16,861 --> 00:17:18,907
Reminds me of being back
in the Colosseum.

351
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:21,518
Yeah, you just stand there
in the Colosseum too?

352
00:17:21,562 --> 00:17:23,781
I was letting it
tire itself out.

353
00:17:23,825 --> 00:17:25,696
If it had slain you,
I would've been well-rested

354
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,133
and easily avenged your death.

355
00:17:30,701 --> 00:17:32,616
Being an avenger is stupid.

356
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,141
The goal is to prevent death.
I am a Preventer.

357
00:17:35,184 --> 00:17:37,795
You wanna join the Preventers,
Sparty?

358
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:39,884
Yeah— yes?

359
00:17:39,928 --> 00:17:41,364
Good choice.

360
00:17:41,408 --> 00:17:43,801
Now stop opening pods.

361
00:17:43,845 --> 00:17:46,369
We're gonna go find
who's flying the ship,

362
00:17:46,413 --> 00:17:49,198
and we're gonna prevent them
from breathing.

363
00:17:54,986 --> 00:17:56,336
I'm telling you.

364
00:17:56,379 --> 00:17:58,729
Sara ain't here.
It's a waste of our time.

365
00:17:58,773 --> 00:18:00,644
We're gonna find Sara.

366
00:18:00,688 --> 00:18:03,125
The fact that we found
this person is a sign.

367
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:05,388
And when the universe
shows you a sign,

368
00:18:05,432 --> 00:18:06,781
you should believe it.

369
00:18:06,824 --> 00:18:08,174
Is that right?

370
00:18:08,217 --> 00:18:11,264
The universe exists
for one reason.

371
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:12,830
To kill you.

372
00:18:18,662 --> 00:18:20,621
Hello.
Miss Cruz?

373
00:18:20,664 --> 00:18:23,102
Ma'am?

374
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:24,407
Hm.
Must not be home.

375
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,158
<i>Let's not tell Miss Cruz
we broke in.</i>

376
00:19:03,533 --> 00:19:06,928
When they split up, we'll
take them out one by one.

377
00:19:06,971 --> 00:19:08,234
Nonsense.

378
00:19:08,277 --> 00:19:09,844
We have the element
of surprise.

379
00:19:09,887 --> 00:19:11,150
We attack both savages now,

380
00:19:11,193 --> 00:19:12,499
and we slay them
in one fell swoop.

381
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:14,240
We have no idea
what they're capable of.

382
00:19:14,283 --> 00:19:15,632
Look, I was an assassin.

383
00:19:15,676 --> 00:19:18,374
Rule number one:
isolate your targets.

384
00:19:18,418 --> 00:19:20,420
Do not fight
from the shadows.

385
00:19:20,463 --> 00:19:23,074
I commanded an undefeated army
of 120,000 warriors.

386
00:19:23,118 --> 00:19:25,990
Well, I assure you
they are all dead now.

387
00:19:26,034 --> 00:19:27,383
Then I must avenge them.

388
00:19:27,427 --> 00:19:28,602
No, no avenging.
No avenging.

389
00:19:28,645 --> 00:19:29,690
It's preventing!

390
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:31,300
Prepare to die, savages!

391
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:08,163
I am very, very sorry, David,
you're under pressure.

392
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,992
Look, maybe I can help you.

393
00:20:14,735 --> 00:20:16,258
Ooh, whoa, whoa.

394
00:20:16,302 --> 00:20:18,608
- Why would you do that?
- Astra has a lead.

395
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:20,175
Okay.

396
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,655
All right.
She has a lead.

397
00:20:21,698 --> 00:20:23,657
Go ahead.

398
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:26,050
So I heard about this guy
who was once in hell.

399
00:20:26,094 --> 00:20:27,617
Raved about aliens.

400
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:29,358
His name was Aleister Crowley.

401
00:20:29,402 --> 00:20:31,360
Aleister bloody Crowley.

402
00:20:31,404 --> 00:20:32,970
Come off it.
Crowley's a kook.

403
00:20:33,014 --> 00:20:34,276
That is
the conventional wisdom.

404
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,060
But he had this tome of secrets

405
00:20:36,104 --> 00:20:37,279
called the "Book of the Law."

406
00:20:37,323 --> 00:20:38,454
In it, Crowley detailed

407
00:20:38,498 --> 00:20:40,239
these alien encounters

408
00:20:40,282 --> 00:20:42,328
and spells that
these aliens taught him.

409
00:20:42,371 --> 00:20:44,199
But he disappeared from hell.

410
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,550
Maybe he used these
alien spells to escape.

411
00:20:47,594 --> 00:20:49,378
Yeah.
Crowley didn't escape.

412
00:20:49,422 --> 00:20:50,988
All right?

413
00:20:51,032 --> 00:20:54,035
I summoned him, and then
I trapped him on Earth.

414
00:20:54,078 --> 00:20:56,690
You trapped— sorry—
isn't that a felony?

415
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:58,344
No.

416
00:20:58,387 --> 00:21:00,694
But like most things I do,
it probably should be.

417
00:21:00,737 --> 00:21:03,087
So, what'd
you do with the book, John?

418
00:21:03,131 --> 00:21:04,437
All right, okay.

419
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,916
Being as we don't have
any other ideas,

420
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,963
I kept it safe right over…

421
00:21:11,095 --> 00:21:13,010
Gary!

422
00:21:13,054 --> 00:21:16,536
What'd I tell you
about nicking my things, eh?

423
00:21:33,683 --> 00:21:35,381
Why did you kidnap me?

424
00:21:35,424 --> 00:21:37,078
Gary!

425
00:21:37,121 --> 00:21:38,819
Gary!

426
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,083
Bloody hell Gary
would be reading Crowley,

427
00:21:42,126 --> 00:21:45,086
I have no idea.
There it is.

428
00:21:45,129 --> 00:21:46,783
Find it?

429
00:21:49,395 --> 00:21:51,222
What the hell is that?

430
00:21:51,266 --> 00:21:52,615
Ew.

431
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:01,755
You better help me
understand you,

432
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:03,234
or this is gonna end quick.

433
00:22:04,627 --> 00:22:06,455
Hey!
Hands where I can see them.

434
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,731
Gary?

435
00:22:21,775 --> 00:22:24,647
Please don't be mad.

436
00:22:24,691 --> 00:22:27,215
If she could talk
to aliens,

437
00:22:27,258 --> 00:22:29,609
why would she live
in a redneck dump like this?

438
00:22:29,652 --> 00:22:32,002
Maybe you're right.
But isn't it worth making sure?

439
00:22:32,046 --> 00:22:34,570
<i>Besides,
Ava really needs a win.</i>

440
00:22:36,137 --> 00:22:39,009
I don't need a win.
We all need a win.

441
00:22:39,053 --> 00:22:41,621
This isn't about me.
Oh, my God.

442
00:22:42,491 --> 00:22:44,145
- Don't give me that look.
- What look?

443
00:22:44,188 --> 00:22:45,581
You know exactly what look.

444
00:22:45,625 --> 00:22:47,278
"You'll feel better
not bottling up

445
00:22:47,322 --> 00:22:48,758
- your emotions" look?
- I'm not bottling them up.

446
00:22:48,802 --> 00:22:50,194
I just don't wanna talk
about them.

447
00:22:50,238 --> 00:22:52,022
Okay.

448
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:54,198
- I'm just gonna say one thing.
- Nate.

449
00:22:54,242 --> 00:22:56,897
You have not mentioned
Sara's proposal once.

450
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,855
I am setting aside
my feelings

451
00:22:58,899 --> 00:23:00,814
to focus on the goal
of getting Sara back.

452
00:23:00,857 --> 00:23:02,293
Okay?
You should too.

453
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,862
I wonder what's in there.

454
00:23:05,906 --> 00:23:07,734
Let me guess.

455
00:23:07,777 --> 00:23:10,214
More dumb redneck stuff.

456
00:23:22,052 --> 00:23:24,838
Guess she's not such
a dumb redneck after all.

457
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:35,152
Guess not.

458
00:23:41,942 --> 00:23:44,205
<i>Behrad, Mick, answer me.</i>

459
00:23:44,248 --> 00:23:45,641
Great.
Two more abductions.

460
00:23:45,685 --> 00:23:47,034
This is why we don't talk

461
00:23:47,077 --> 00:23:48,601
about emotions
during the mission.

462
00:23:48,644 --> 00:23:50,167
Okay, Gideon's scanning
for heat signatures.

463
00:23:50,211 --> 00:23:51,386
It's— it's gonna be okay.

464
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,474
- Okay?
- Yeah.

465
00:23:52,518 --> 00:23:53,823
Three Legends are missing.

466
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:55,346
Things are pretty far
from okay.

467
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,826
Yeah, well they just
got further, love.

468
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:59,307
We found something
in Gary's room.

469
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,701
A human-sized chrysalis.

470
00:24:01,744 --> 00:24:03,137
Guys, we don't understand.

471
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,269
Gary is an alien.

472
00:24:05,313 --> 00:24:07,576
An alien?
Oh, my—

473
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,795
Okay.
I don't buy it.

474
00:24:08,838 --> 00:24:12,320
Well, we also found these.

475
00:24:12,363 --> 00:24:13,756
Gary's glasses?

476
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,107
Oh, allow me to demonstrate.

477
00:24:17,151 --> 00:24:19,501
And brace yourselves.

478
00:24:23,287 --> 00:24:24,854
No.

479
00:24:29,076 --> 00:24:30,773
Gary abducted Sara.

480
00:24:34,647 --> 00:24:37,780
I was sent to Earth to kidnap
the quintessential human.

481
00:24:37,824 --> 00:24:38,912
Spartacus?

482
00:24:38,955 --> 00:24:42,132
Oh, no, no, no.
You!

483
00:24:42,176 --> 00:24:43,917
Spartacus was just
my boss's lunch.

484
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,354
But don't worry.
I don't eat humans.

485
00:24:46,397 --> 00:24:48,182
Anymore.

486
00:24:48,225 --> 00:24:50,532
Terrific.

487
00:24:50,576 --> 00:24:52,491
The point is, I couldn't go
through with your abduction

488
00:24:52,534 --> 00:24:54,014
because I fell
in love with you,

489
00:24:54,057 --> 00:24:56,495
with Ava, with all humans.

490
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:57,626
Yeah, well that's funny
because I still feel

491
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,193
very abducted, Gary.

492
00:24:59,236 --> 00:25:01,369
Well, my boss, Kayla,
found us.

493
00:25:01,412 --> 00:25:03,545
But I remained loyal.
That's why I saved you.

494
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:06,069
- You saved me?
- Yeah!

495
00:25:06,113 --> 00:25:08,637
I rigged the pod to open
with your handprint.

496
00:25:08,681 --> 00:25:10,465
Okay— Gary,
where are we going?

497
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,120
No clue.
Kayla doesn't trust me anymore.

498
00:25:13,163 --> 00:25:14,643
I don't blame her.

499
00:25:14,687 --> 00:25:17,733
Yeah, well, you and I
are also not okay.

500
00:25:17,777 --> 00:25:19,213
Do you have any idea
how wrecked

501
00:25:19,256 --> 00:25:21,084
Ava must feel right now?

502
00:25:21,128 --> 00:25:23,478
I mean, yeah, I'm sure she's
pretending to keep it together

503
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,480
for everyone else's sake,
but inside,

504
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,004
- she must be dying.
- Stop, stop!

505
00:25:28,048 --> 00:25:30,877
It's torture to even think
about what Ava's going through.

506
00:25:32,052 --> 00:25:34,445
Do me in.
I deserve it.

507
00:25:34,489 --> 00:25:37,013
I've destroyed the very thing
I most stan.

508
00:25:37,057 --> 00:25:39,886
Knock it off.
You're gonna help me get home.

509
00:25:39,929 --> 00:25:42,453
Now tell me everything
that you know about this ship.

510
00:25:42,497 --> 00:25:45,500
Well…

511
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,763
when you first met,
you butt heads.

512
00:25:47,807 --> 00:25:50,113
But any fool could tell you two
were meant for each other.

513
00:25:50,157 --> 00:25:52,812
This spaceship, Gary.

514
00:25:52,855 --> 00:25:54,988
Oh.

515
00:26:01,647 --> 00:26:04,606
What the— what the— hey!

516
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:06,042
<i>Ava?</i>

517
00:26:06,086 --> 00:26:08,044
- <i>Nate?</i>
- Behrad, are you guys okay?

518
00:26:08,088 --> 00:26:10,612
<i>Yeah, it is very far
from chill in here.</i>

519
00:26:10,656 --> 00:26:12,614
2100 hours.

520
00:26:12,658 --> 00:26:15,225
Trespassers have
regained consciousness.

521
00:26:15,269 --> 00:26:17,401
They were armed
with some fancy weapons.

522
00:26:17,445 --> 00:26:18,577
Not sure why.

523
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,535
Only one way to find out.

524
00:26:23,451 --> 00:26:25,801
I told you the universe
was trying to kill us.

525
00:26:25,845 --> 00:26:27,324
What was that, old timer?

526
00:26:27,368 --> 00:26:29,849
I wasn't talking to you,
Miss Crazy.

527
00:26:31,415 --> 00:26:33,548
I don't like
being called that.

528
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:34,593
He didn't mean that,
Miss Cruz.

529
00:26:34,636 --> 00:26:35,637
Spooner.

530
00:26:35,681 --> 00:26:36,899
I go by Spooner now.

531
00:26:36,943 --> 00:26:38,640
Okay, Spooner, ma'am.

532
00:26:38,684 --> 00:26:41,904
This is all just
a misunderstanding.

533
00:26:41,948 --> 00:26:43,819
The alien communicator
in your head,

534
00:26:43,863 --> 00:26:45,821
we need you to use it
to find our friend.

535
00:26:45,865 --> 00:26:48,868
So y'all's plan was not only
to break onto my property,

536
00:26:48,911 --> 00:26:50,434
but to kidnap me?

537
00:26:50,478 --> 00:26:53,394
We were gonna ask.
In fact, we still are.

538
00:26:53,437 --> 00:26:55,004
- What?
- Shh.

539
00:26:55,048 --> 00:26:56,615
Will you come with us?

540
00:26:56,658 --> 00:26:58,486
Come with you?

541
00:26:58,529 --> 00:27:00,662
Oh, but you ain't going.

542
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:07,582
Please hurry.

543
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:08,801
She's getting real friendly

544
00:27:08,844 --> 00:27:10,106
with her knife.

545
00:27:13,283 --> 00:27:14,415
Who you talking to?

546
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:16,504
Uh, he's a schizophrenic.

547
00:27:16,547 --> 00:27:18,593
- He talks to himself.
- It's true.

548
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,813
It's a nervous tick actually.

549
00:27:22,031 --> 00:27:24,468
Uh— could— could— hey.

550
00:27:24,512 --> 00:27:26,253
Wait.
Hey, hey, hey— hey.

551
00:27:26,296 --> 00:27:27,994
Wait, wait.
Hey, hey!

552
00:27:28,037 --> 00:27:29,952
No!

553
00:27:29,996 --> 00:27:31,606
Behrad?
What's happening?

554
00:27:34,261 --> 00:27:37,873
Uh, the universe
ripped his comms out.

555
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,661
<i>Captain Sharpe, I've
pinpointed their location.</i>

556
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:44,097
Oh, thank God.

557
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,751
I'm not losing
any more Legends today.

558
00:27:45,794 --> 00:27:48,884
<i>Gideon, take the ship
to that location.</i>

559
00:27:48,928 --> 00:27:50,799
A ship?

560
00:27:50,843 --> 00:27:53,454
Nate, you're with me.

561
00:27:53,497 --> 00:27:55,369
Wait, hang on.
Why is my voice echoing?

562
00:27:55,412 --> 00:27:56,805
She hacked my comms.

563
00:27:56,849 --> 00:27:58,633
She can hear everything
you're saying.

564
00:28:14,301 --> 00:28:16,477
That thing
against the Waverider?

565
00:28:18,522 --> 00:28:19,828
Whoa!

566
00:28:21,047 --> 00:28:22,701
Touché, Spooner.

567
00:28:26,313 --> 00:28:29,925
Please stop shooting my ship.

568
00:28:29,969 --> 00:28:32,101
Don't come any closer.

569
00:28:32,145 --> 00:28:34,321
I ain't gon' let y'all
abduct me again.

570
00:28:34,364 --> 00:28:36,627
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold on, hold on.

571
00:28:36,671 --> 00:28:39,369
That's what you think this is?
You think we're aliens?

572
00:28:39,413 --> 00:28:41,850
- The hell else could you be?
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

573
00:28:41,894 --> 00:28:45,071
- We're time travelers.
- Time travelers?

574
00:28:45,114 --> 00:28:47,247
Yes!
That's our time ship.

575
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,989
Which is also a spaceship,
but that's beside the point.

576
00:28:50,032 --> 00:28:52,469
Look, I'm sorry
that we trespassed, okay?

577
00:28:52,513 --> 00:28:53,862
It was wrong.

578
00:28:53,906 --> 00:28:55,124
But—

579
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,604
We're desperate.

580
00:28:56,647 --> 00:28:58,693
Listen.

581
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:02,828
The woman I love was abducted
by aliens last night.

582
00:29:02,871 --> 00:29:06,005
And I just found that
she's gonna propose to me.

583
00:29:08,572 --> 00:29:10,966
I will do anything

584
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:14,274
if you can find her.

585
00:29:14,317 --> 00:29:16,537
Will you please help me?

586
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,847
Exactly what an alien
would say.

587
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:22,891
Just—

588
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,636
Now can I burn
this place down?

589
00:29:33,467 --> 00:29:34,685
Can we go over the plan
one more time?

590
00:29:34,729 --> 00:29:36,557
Because it still feels
slightly suicidal.

591
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,906
Well, we don't have
enough fuel

592
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,299
to turn around and go home,
right?

593
00:29:39,342 --> 00:29:40,996
- Uh-huh.
- So we commandeer the ship.

594
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,824
From Kayla,
my vicious, violent,

595
00:29:42,868 --> 00:29:44,608
and very vindictive boss.

596
00:29:44,652 --> 00:29:47,046
Then we open a wormhole back
to Earth's temporal zone.

597
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:48,699
An unstable rip
in spacetime itself.

598
00:29:48,743 --> 00:29:50,179
And then we fly the ship
through it.

599
00:29:50,223 --> 00:29:51,833
On whatever fumes remain

600
00:29:51,877 --> 00:29:53,139
after we burn everything

601
00:29:53,182 --> 00:29:54,531
opening the wormhole.

602
00:29:54,575 --> 00:29:56,185
Well then,
we better get moving.

603
00:29:56,229 --> 00:29:58,840
First things, you gotta go
get rid of your boss.

604
00:29:58,884 --> 00:30:01,843
Right.
Okay.

605
00:30:03,236 --> 00:30:05,847
Here goes nothing.

606
00:30:05,891 --> 00:30:09,285
Gary, your glasses.

607
00:30:09,329 --> 00:30:10,765
Whoops.

608
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,291
All right.
Guess we'll do it this way.

609
00:31:03,731 --> 00:31:06,516
Okay.
Wormhole time.

610
00:31:38,809 --> 00:31:40,376
Morning, sunshine.

611
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,206
Tables may have turned,

612
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,816
but I ain't going down
without a fight.

613
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,253
Whoa.
We're not gonna hurt you.

614
00:31:47,296 --> 00:31:48,907
Look.

615
00:31:52,171 --> 00:31:53,824
Where the hell am I?

616
00:31:53,868 --> 00:31:56,392
Like Ava said before,
we're time travelers.

617
00:31:56,436 --> 00:31:58,742
- This is our time ship.
- Admit it.

618
00:31:58,786 --> 00:32:00,831
You're only being nice so
I'll help you find your friend.

619
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:03,225
100%.
Yes.

620
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:06,663
Even if I wanted
to help y'all, I can't.

621
00:32:06,707 --> 00:32:08,622
Why not?

622
00:32:08,665 --> 00:32:10,754
This thing in my head
is like an antenna.

623
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:12,539
If I send a signal
to your friend,

624
00:32:12,582 --> 00:32:14,019
the aliens who put it there
could find me.

625
00:32:14,062 --> 00:32:15,977
Look, we have the technology

626
00:32:16,021 --> 00:32:17,370
to remove whatever's
in your head

627
00:32:17,413 --> 00:32:21,113
if— if you help us find Sara.

628
00:32:21,156 --> 00:32:23,245
How is my signal
gonna locate her?

629
00:32:23,289 --> 00:32:24,986
It doesn't have to.

630
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:26,988
Our friend will direct it
to the aliens that she's with.

631
00:32:27,032 --> 00:32:28,772
Oh!
If you think we're weird,

632
00:32:28,816 --> 00:32:30,296
wait till you meet John.

633
00:32:32,124 --> 00:32:35,779
So I send out my signal
and connect to this alien guy.

634
00:32:35,823 --> 00:32:37,433
His name is Gary.

635
00:32:37,477 --> 00:32:40,262
- He's an alien named Gary?
- Gary Green.

636
00:32:40,306 --> 00:32:42,395
Ah, Green.
Yeah, now it makes sense.

637
00:32:42,438 --> 00:32:44,788
Once you make the connection,
I'll step into that Sigil

638
00:32:44,832 --> 00:32:46,138
then Astral Project myself

639
00:32:46,181 --> 00:32:48,444
to Gary's location.

640
00:32:48,488 --> 00:32:50,403
- And then I'll look for Sara.
- Right.

641
00:32:50,446 --> 00:32:51,882
And how do I connect

642
00:32:51,926 --> 00:32:53,449
to this Gary alien
who I've never met?

643
00:32:53,493 --> 00:32:55,974
You'll drink a potion
of sorts.

644
00:32:56,017 --> 00:32:58,367
One delish smoothie
coming at you.

645
00:32:58,411 --> 00:32:59,934
- Good luck.
- Crowley's spell requires you

646
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,283
to ingest something of Gary's.

647
00:33:01,327 --> 00:33:03,372
The chrysalis
is all we've got.

648
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:05,505
- Seriously?
- No, she's not gonna—

649
00:33:05,548 --> 00:33:06,985
The sooner this is over,

650
00:33:07,028 --> 00:33:08,638
the sooner
this thing's out of my head.

651
00:33:08,682 --> 00:33:09,988
But I hope it works.

652
00:33:10,031 --> 00:33:11,772
<i>Salud.</i>

653
00:33:11,815 --> 00:33:13,165
Oh, God.

654
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:14,514
- Oh.
- Oh.

655
00:33:14,557 --> 00:33:16,907
She did it.

656
00:33:16,951 --> 00:33:18,997
Eh.
Kinda tangy.

657
00:33:20,824 --> 00:33:23,740
All right, um, ready?

658
00:33:25,568 --> 00:33:28,049
Yeah, after my abduction,
I started wearing tinfoil hats.

659
00:33:28,093 --> 00:33:29,746
It blocked any alien signals
I could pick up.

660
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:31,487
Huh. Nifty.
Right.

661
00:33:31,531 --> 00:33:33,098
On with the show.

662
00:33:53,814 --> 00:33:56,077
I can feel him.

663
00:33:57,644 --> 00:33:59,559
<i>I found the alien.</i>

664
00:33:59,602 --> 00:34:01,256
A lot dweebier than I thought.

665
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,085
- Bloody Crowley was right.
- I can sense him.

666
00:34:04,129 --> 00:34:07,001
<i>He's worried and wants
to come down to Earth.</i>

667
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,829
It looks like he's trying
to help Sara.

668
00:34:08,872 --> 00:34:10,918
Oh, I just need
to step into the Sigil

669
00:34:10,961 --> 00:34:12,093
and find her.

670
00:34:13,442 --> 00:34:14,922
John, are you okay?

671
00:34:14,965 --> 00:34:17,055
Spooner's connection
is unstable.

672
00:34:17,098 --> 00:34:18,708
I'm giving it everything
just to maintain it.

673
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,101
- I'll do it.
- No, whoa, whoa.

674
00:34:20,145 --> 00:34:21,276
Are you crazy?
You'll kill yourself.

675
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,712
Look what's happening to John.

676
00:34:22,756 --> 00:34:24,236
It's plan B, Nate.
Embrace it.

677
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,987
<i>Sara?</i>

678
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:46,258
Ava.

679
00:34:46,301 --> 00:34:48,390
Wait, how…

680
00:34:48,434 --> 00:34:50,088
How are you…

681
00:34:50,131 --> 00:34:51,654
Are you here?

682
00:34:51,698 --> 00:34:52,916
<i>Hey, hey, hey.
Stay with me.</i>

683
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,832
<i>Look at me.</i>

684
00:34:55,876 --> 00:34:58,835
<i>Yes.</i>

685
00:34:58,879 --> 00:35:00,750
Yes, what?

686
00:35:00,794 --> 00:35:04,711
<i>When you get home,
I'll marry you.</i>

687
00:35:04,754 --> 00:35:08,106
<i>So you better get home, okay?</i>

688
00:35:11,761 --> 00:35:14,982
<i>I love you.</i>

689
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:19,160
He's killing himself.

690
00:35:19,204 --> 00:35:21,467
We have to stop him.

691
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:33,087
John.
Look at me.

692
00:36:26,532 --> 00:36:28,098
Round two.

693
00:36:36,716 --> 00:36:39,414
Wormhole's open, Sara!

694
00:36:59,391 --> 00:37:01,349
Whoa!

695
00:37:01,393 --> 00:37:02,829
No, no!

696
00:37:48,701 --> 00:37:51,269
Once again, I wake
to Zari Tarazi.

697
00:37:51,312 --> 00:37:52,748
Oh, you're up?

698
00:37:52,792 --> 00:37:55,185
I almost died.

699
00:37:55,229 --> 00:37:56,578
But you saved me.

700
00:37:56,622 --> 00:37:58,145
Yeah, well I couldn't
let you die

701
00:37:58,188 --> 00:38:01,191
right after getting
your soul back, so…

702
00:38:03,759 --> 00:38:05,457
Gidget said you
might be dehydrated,

703
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,372
so I made you a green smoothie
to help you recover.

704
00:38:07,415 --> 00:38:09,112
Sans alien cocoon.

705
00:38:09,156 --> 00:38:10,940
Oh, cheers.

706
00:38:10,984 --> 00:38:12,855
Mmm.

707
00:38:12,899 --> 00:38:14,161
Yep.

708
00:38:14,204 --> 00:38:16,816
It's very tasty.

709
00:38:16,859 --> 00:38:20,428
Hey, uh, let me know when
you have your strength back.

710
00:38:30,133 --> 00:38:31,744
It's a fling.

711
00:38:31,787 --> 00:38:33,485
Uh-huh.

712
00:38:33,528 --> 00:38:37,358
You know I can tell
when someone's bluffing, right?

713
00:38:37,402 --> 00:38:39,186
It looks like Crowley wasn't.

714
00:38:39,229 --> 00:38:41,449
Yeah, well,
even if alien magic is real,

715
00:38:41,493 --> 00:38:43,146
Crowley is a slippery fish.

716
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:44,539
He's not to be trusted.

717
00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:47,716
Hm.
Whatever you say, roomie.

718
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,763
Hey, that was a short
residence on the Waverider, eh?

719
00:38:50,806 --> 00:38:54,375
Yeah, I can't keep getting
roped into Legends missions.

720
00:38:54,419 --> 00:38:55,811
Let's just say
I'm not as enamored

721
00:38:55,855 --> 00:38:58,205
of the timeline
as everyone else.

722
00:38:58,248 --> 00:38:59,989
It's like you said,

723
00:39:00,033 --> 00:39:02,470
I'm mortal now.

724
00:39:02,514 --> 00:39:06,735
I wanna see what it's like
to be…normal.

725
00:39:06,779 --> 00:39:09,390
Maybe I can love this world
like the rest of you do.

726
00:39:09,434 --> 00:39:12,219
You've come a long way,
you little Hellspawn.

727
00:39:14,134 --> 00:39:16,832
And come on, John.

728
00:39:16,876 --> 00:39:18,530
Just a fling?

729
00:39:18,573 --> 00:39:21,968
She's got you
on a juice cleanse.

730
00:39:31,586 --> 00:39:33,022
<i>Sure you won't stick around?</i>

731
00:39:33,066 --> 00:39:34,981
You've got a pretty chill vibe

732
00:39:35,024 --> 00:39:37,244
beneath your gun-toting
outcast vibe.

733
00:39:37,287 --> 00:39:39,289
Look, we contacted
your friend,

734
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:41,335
and I'm sorry
she's not back yet.

735
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:42,728
But I want this thing removed

736
00:39:42,771 --> 00:39:44,338
so I can finally live
a normal life.

737
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,818
I get that.

738
00:39:45,861 --> 00:39:48,342
You wanna keep it zen
in the brain stem.

739
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:51,737
Dr. Gideon will fix you up.

740
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,437
What do you see, Gideon?

741
00:39:59,048 --> 00:40:00,833
<i>Nothing out of the ordinary.</i>

742
00:40:00,876 --> 00:40:02,704
Really?
Can you look closer?

743
00:40:02,748 --> 00:40:04,663
<i>If I removed and thoroughly
dissected her brain,</i>

744
00:40:04,706 --> 00:40:06,621
<i>we might something
the scan did not detect.</i>

745
00:40:06,665 --> 00:40:08,406
<i>May I proceed?</i>

746
00:40:08,449 --> 00:40:09,755
What's going on out there?

747
00:40:09,798 --> 00:40:11,539
No.
Don't kill her, Gideon.

748
00:40:11,583 --> 00:40:13,193
Yeah, I can hear it.

749
00:40:13,236 --> 00:40:14,499
I wasn't gonna let her—

750
00:40:14,542 --> 00:40:16,718
You can't hear it, can you?

751
00:40:20,243 --> 00:40:22,289
They're all around us.

752
00:40:26,511 --> 00:40:28,338
I've never seen
anything like this

753
00:40:28,382 --> 00:40:29,601
in a temporal zone.

754
00:40:29,644 --> 00:40:31,864
Aliens.
Lots of 'em.

755
00:40:31,907 --> 00:40:33,953
They're falling
into the timeline.

756
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:46,313
Why are you smiling?

757
00:40:46,356 --> 00:40:47,749
We gotta clean this mess up.

758
00:40:47,793 --> 00:40:49,316
I know.

759
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:50,796
It's just that the only person

760
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:53,494
who could create
this much mayhem is Sara

761
00:40:53,538 --> 00:40:55,322
which means she's alive.

762
00:40:55,365 --> 00:40:58,020
Well, if the universe
shows you a sign,

763
00:40:58,064 --> 00:41:00,196
you should believe it.

764
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,460
Mm!

765
00:41:06,115 --> 00:41:07,856
Engaged?

766
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,468
- I'm so happy I could cry.
- Gary, if we don't get

767
00:41:10,511 --> 00:41:12,252
through that wormhole,
we are stuck here.

768
00:41:12,295 --> 00:41:14,994
I'm going as fast as I can.
I'm sorry.

769
00:41:15,037 --> 00:41:17,257
I'm not as good a pilot
as my fiancé.

770
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:20,390
Wait, you and that
other alien are engaged?

771
00:41:20,434 --> 00:41:23,263
Her name's Kayla, but yeah.
I assume the wedding's off now.

772
00:41:23,306 --> 00:41:25,134
- Did I not mention that?
- We can talk about this later.

773
00:41:25,178 --> 00:41:26,658
Right now, just get us
through that wormhole.

774
00:41:26,701 --> 00:41:28,355
Yeah.

775
00:41:30,575 --> 00:41:32,185
We're gonna make it.

776
00:41:32,228 --> 00:41:34,230
- We're not gonna make it.
- We're gonna make it.

777
00:41:36,581 --> 00:41:38,191
We didn't make it.
