1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,200
<i>In 2166 an immortal tyrant
named Vandal Savage</i>

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,800
<i>conquered the world
and murdered my wife and child.</i>

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,600
<i>I have assembled an elite team
to hunt him throughout time</i>

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,320
<i>and stop his rise to power.</i>

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,640
<i>Unfortunately,
my plan is opposed by the body</i>

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,840
<i>I'd sworn my allegiance to,
the Time Masters.</i>

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,120
<i>In the future,
my friends may not be heroes,</i>

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,840
<i>but if we succeed, they will be
remembered</i> as legends.

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,760
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

10
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,840
Two years.

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,560
You left us stranded in 1958.

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,640
I was happy with the life
we built together,

13
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,360
the one I thought would be
our future.

14
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,760
Chronos attacked us.

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,560
He sabotaged the ship
and took Snart.

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:39,640
If you're gonna kill me,

17
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,520
you could at least tell me
what's going on.

18
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,120
The Time Masters,

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,360
they took me to a place
called the Vanishing Point.

20
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,560
I've spent lifetimes training
by them, being reborn.

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,640
Don't kill him.

22
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,640
The Time Masters took one of our own

23
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,080
and turned him against us.

24
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,480
I say we undo their handiwork.

25
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,080
{\an5}I trust that you're comfortable,
Mr. Rory.

26
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,520
{\an5}Or do you answer
to Chronos these days?

27
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,560
I don't take orders from you.

28
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,440
I can't believe I ever did.

29
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,360
Well, that's debatable.

30
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,200
I'm calling on you for two reasons.

31
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,400
First, we could use your help.

32
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,040
What's the second reason?

33
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,120
{\an5}We're headed to 2147
to engage Savage.

34
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,640
Is that the second reason
or the first?

35
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,040
Forget it.

36
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,960
I owe you an apology, Mr. Rory.

37
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,080
I failed you.

38
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,400
{\an5}I brought you along on this mission
under false pretenses,

39
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,560
in denial of your true nature.

40
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,600
And when that nature took its course,

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,680
I asked Mr. Snart to...

42
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:57,960
deal with you.

43
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:02,920
My point being,

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,080
your quarrel should be with me
and not with him.

45
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,000
Well, if it makes you feel
any better,

46
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,720
I want to kill both of you.

47
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,520
<i>Captain, we've arrived at 2147.</i>

48
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,440
Thank you, Gideon.

49
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,360
Set a course
for the Kasnian Conglomerate.

50
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,400
150 years in the future

51
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,920
and people are still wearing wool?

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Man, I hate wool.

53
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,080
Be grateful, Mr. Jackson.

54
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,360
Those living outside the Kasnian
Conglomerate are dressed in rags.

55
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,560
- Conglomerate?
- Yes.

56
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,680
{\an5}In the year 2080, government began
to give way to corporations.

57
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,160
More like 2008.

58
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,160
{\an5}According to Gideon,
in two hours' time,

59
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,200
{\an5}our favorite immortal psychopath
is scheduled to attend a meeting

60
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,720
of the Conglomerate's shareholders.

61
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,160
Oh, sounds exciting.

62
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,280
You think Savage takes over the world
by trading stocks?

63
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,080
{\an5}What we do know is,
in 20 years' time,

64
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,680
{\an5}Kasnia is the foothold from which
Savage takes over the world,

65
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,120
{\an5}so we hardly want to take him
on there.

66
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,640
{\an5}But if we can figure out
how his actions here

67
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,240
{\an5}lead to his rise to power,
then we won't need to.

68
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,040
Copy that, Captain.

69
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,720
{\an5}But if we're gonna be
checking out the future...

70
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,920
{\an5}We should probably invite
the nerd twins.

71
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,880
{\an5}You know, I can already hear
what Stan's gonna say about 2147.

72
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,320
The future, it's...

73
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,920
{\an5}- Fascinating.
- Astonishing.

74
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,280
{\an5}Well, it was a 50-50 chance
which one he'd choose.

75
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,400
{\an5}Actually I was going to say,
"Remarkable."

76
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,480
Isn't it?

77
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,000
{\an5}2147 was considered
the world's zenith.

78
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,960
All of these people have five
good years to look forward to.

79
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,200
Before what?

80
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,280
{\an5}Before a ruthless dictator named
Per Degaton comes to power,

81
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,800
releases the Armageddon Virus

82
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,560
and most of them end up dead.

83
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,640
Well, that's depressing.

84
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,480
Is that my suit?

85
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,560
That's my suit.

86
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,480
You have been identified
as violating Ordinance 12.

87
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,960
That is how Per Degaton's father,
Tor maintains order in Kasnia.

88
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,200
Doesn't look like progress to me.

89
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,400
Speaking of progress, we need
to get a better lay of the land.

90
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,320
And I need to get a better look at
how they made my suit autonomous.

91
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,440
Well, why don't you take
Martin and Jax with you?

92
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,680
Ms. Lance, Mr. Snart
and I will work on locating Savage.

93
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,960
{\an5}Tor Degaton holds daily meetings
with his board of directors.

94
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,480
And it's open to the public?

95
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,680
'Course not.

96
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,800
Just Kasnia's shareholders.

97
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,720
I hate to break it to you,
but we're not shareholders.

98
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,520
I'm more of a hard asset man,
myself.

99
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,440
You're clear to attend.

100
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,000
They'll have to wait outside.

101
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,200
Oh, no. This is my accountant

102
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,480
and she is my personal assist...
bodyguard.

103
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,080
Stockholders only.

104
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,640
We've been through this.

105
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,880
I won't put the resolution to a vote.

106
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,000
Sir, with greatest respect,

107
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,760
the situation outside
the Conglomerate's borders

108
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,880
is becoming untenable.

109
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,040
The food riots, climate change.

110
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,280
I am well aware
that the world outside our walls

111
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,800
is descending into chaos.

112
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,360
But causing chaos
cannot be a proper response.

113
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,600
It is not chaos.

114
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,480
It is logic.

115
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,240
The world's population is
unsustainable at current levels.

116
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,320
The herd must be thinned.

117
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,000
So you've argued, Mr. Savage.

118
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,080
But no matter how many times
you choose to press your point,

119
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,040
my decision shall stand.

120
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,080
Vandal.

121
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,640
Oh, my boy.

122
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,680
My father would have you killed
for calling me that.

123
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,520
Oh, I wouldn't want
to chance execution.

124
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,640
Per Degaton.

125
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,160
So how did the meeting go?

126
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,400
Well, your father was being
his usual intractable self.

127
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,080
The problem is, my young student,

128
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,120
to run a corporation is not the same
as ruling a country.

129
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,160
If you're implying that my father
doesn't have what it takes...

130
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,760
Yes, he would have killed me
for that as well.

131
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,560
Well, I suppose I just have to live
dangerously then.

132
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,560
So how are your studies progressing?

133
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,800
He's a teacher.

134
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,240
Tutor, it would seem,
to young Per Degaton himself.

135
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,640
You say that like
it's supposed to mean something.

136
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,080
After the death of his father
in five years' time,

137
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,960
Per Degaton unleashes
the Armageddon Virus,

138
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,080
which decimates
the world's population,

139
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,800
leaving it ripe for conquest.

140
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,800
Per Degaton primes
the world for dictatorship

141
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,400
and then when the time is right...

142
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,760
Savage snatches that power
away from him.

143
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,320
By killing Per Degaton.

144
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,440
Indeed.

145
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,360
Okay, so we don't have what we need
to take out Savage,

146
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,040
but maybe now we can figure out
a way to stop his rise to power.

147
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,560
By depriving him of his springboard,
Per Degaton.

148
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,960
Okay, how do we do that?

149
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,360
It's quite simple, really.

150
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,000
We kill the little bastard ourselves.

151
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,120
To be clear, we're talking
about murdering a child.

152
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,040
Who hasn't done anything to anyone.

153
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,760
Yet, so why don't we pick him off
now,

154
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,040
while the picking's easy?

155
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,880
There's got to be a better way.

156
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:08,280
{\an5}How do we even know
that this Per Degaton kid's path

157
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,880
{\an5}to becoming a world-ruling
dictator is inevitable?

158
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,360
Because in the future that I'm from,

159
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,320
{\an5}children learn about Per Degaton
in the same way

160
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,120
{\an5}that children in your time
learn about Adolf Hitler.

161
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,560
What about addressing
the larger societal problems

162
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,720
that would allow
such a despot's rise to power?

163
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,840
We already know what pushes this punk
to the dark side, Savage.

164
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,000
Look, it's not the kid's fault

165
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,960
he's got an immortal psychopath
as his tutor.

166
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,120
{\an5}If we don't kill the kid now,

167
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,160
{\an5}Savage will as soon as he's done
using him to take over the world.

168
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,160
If he doesn't build him
into the greatest tyrant

169
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,240
the world has ever known,

170
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,640
Savage can't become the last tyrant
the world will ever know.

171
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,840
Murdering a child in cold blood

172
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,720
just like Savage murdered
your own son.

173
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,080
What's the use in saving the world
if we stoop to his methods to do so?

174
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,160
I'm with Professor Stein.

175
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,400
Okay, fine.

176
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,120
If you all don't have the guts
to kill this kid...

177
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,040
Then removing him from the timeline
might be the next best thing.

178
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,000
Great. We've gone from infanticide
to child abduction.

179
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,440
Progress.

180
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,480
First, we need to devise
how to abduct him

181
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,840
from underneath the noses
of his father's private guard.

182
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,080
And don't forget the army
of Atom robots.

183
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,280
We're going to need
an accomplished thief.

184
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,200
Well, while you're kidnapping
baby Hitler,

185
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,800
Professor Stein and I
will sabotage the robot army.

186
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,200
I call Team Robot Army.

187
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,880
Isn't that a waste of time?

188
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,120
Not for the Kasnian citizens
who are tormented by my technology.

189
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,520
That technology does lead
to Savage's rise to power.

190
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,120
Good backup plan.

191
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,880
Fine, Team Kidnapping.

192
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,520
Go, team.

193
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,160
Hey, you okay?

194
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,600
Yeah, yeah. I was just... thinking.

195
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,320
I think I understand.

196
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,440
You do?

197
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,600
Yeah, it's Savage.

198
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,960
He's so close you can sense him,
right?

199
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,920
Yeah.

200
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,920
Do you want to talk about it?

201
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,680
No. Don't worry about me.

202
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,280
I'll be fine.

203
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,360
Okay.

204
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,760
<i>Honey?</i>

205
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,040
<i>Honey?</i>

206
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,520
I'm home.

207
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,920
What's the matter?

208
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Nothing.

209
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,880
Can I fix you a drink?

210
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,440
That would be lovely.

211
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,600
And while you do,
you can tell me what's on your mind.

212
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,320
Really, it's nothing.

213
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,800
You are a terrible liar.

214
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,760
Yes, but... you love me anyway.

215
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,600
Beyond anything I can describe.

216
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,520
And because I love you, I know
when something's bothering you.

217
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,040
It's... it's just a feeling.

218
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,600
Of him?

219
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,800
It's hard to tell.

220
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:05,960
I haven't sensed Savage's presence.
But you do... or you think you do.

221
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,080
I think it's time for us to go.

222
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,760
I have some vacation time coming up.

223
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,760
We can drive to Coast City
and do some sightseeing.

224
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,200
- A vacation isn't going to fix this.
- I know.

225
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,360
Savage isn't just gonna forget
about us because we went away.

226
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,440
I know.

227
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,200
And he's not gonna stop until...

228
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,320
Mommy?

229
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,960
I can't sleep.

230
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,120
Hey, Slugger.

231
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,320
Daddy.

232
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,440
Come here.

233
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,960
What's wrong?

234
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,080
Nothing. Nothing.

235
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,640
I just love you so much.

236
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,600
I love both of you so much.

237
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,640
No litter. No street crime. No smog.

238
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,320
How soon can we leave?

239
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,720
<i>Keep your eyes peeled.</i>

240
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,840
According to Gideon,

241
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,640
Per Degaton should be passing
through any minute

242
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,360
on his way to gymnastics class.

243
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,240
Are you telling me future Hitler
is enrolled in a gymnastics class?

244
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,640
Yes.

245
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,440
I got eyes on Little Lord Fauntleroy.

246
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,000
<i>I don't see him.</i>

247
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,960
It's because he's surrounded
by Daddy's goon squad.

248
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,440
<i>Northeast corner of the plaza.</i>

249
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,280
Got him.

250
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,280
<i>You sure you don't want
to just shoot him?</i>

251
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,800
It'd be a whole lot easier.

252
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,840
Stick to the plan, both of you.

253
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,360
Now, Ms. Lance.

254
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,840
I'm in position.

255
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,720
It's up to you now, Mr. Snart.

256
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,480
Take the asset! Move back!

257
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,920
Since the introduction
of our latest line

258
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,880
of autonomous law enforcement
officers,

259
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,480
crime has dropped precipitously.

260
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,360
- In fact, it's nonexistent.
- Really?

261
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,960
Well, thank you for showing us
around, Dr. Brice.

262
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,240
It's my pleasure.

263
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,600
We don't get very many visitors
from Central City

264
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,240
ever since the S.T.A.R. Labs
Corporation took it over.

265
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,080
Unless I'm mistaken, your tech
utilizes a dwarf star alloy.

266
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,360
The technology is proprietary,
but yes.

267
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,000
How did you know, Doctor...

268
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,080
Lecter...

269
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,040
Dr. Hannibal Lecter.

270
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:53,040
So how did you get into robotics,
Dr. Brice?

271
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,400
Oh, well, it's in my blood.

272
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,840
Robotics have been
a passion of my family

273
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,400
ever since my great-great-great-great
grandfather founded this company.

274
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,320
Is that...

275
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,960
Oh, my God.

276
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,680
Huh, weird.

277
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,560
You look just like him.

278
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,400
Yes, I look just like...

279
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,880
Yeah, that's... that's pretty weird.

280
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,600
I can't believe it.

281
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,720
I'm like the Werner Von Braun
of robots.

282
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,800
The who?

283
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,320
The Nazi scientist
who invented the V2 rocket,

284
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,040
built it using slave labor,
then used it to level London.

285
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,400
Except my robots will one day be used
to level the entire world.

286
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,960
Ray, dude, do you not think you're
focusing on the wrong thing here?

287
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,760
I mean, you have a kid
you didn't even know about.

288
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,840
Had a kid.

289
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,400
In this particular time period,

290
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,640
his offspring would be
long since dead.

291
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,960
Thank you, as if I wasn't already
feeling bad enough.

292
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,480
How is it even possible
that I'm someone's

293
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,520
great-great-great-great grandfather?

294
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,880
Before we left in 2016,
the only person I was...

295
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:04,080
Having sex with?

296
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,680
Ghosted me the week before we left.

297
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,920
She died?

298
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,240
No, no, ghosting.

299
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,440
It's where you pretend to be dead
by not answering somebody's text.

300
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:16,240
What a strange age for dating.

301
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,360
You think maybe she didn't reply
to your text because...

302
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,720
She knew she was pregnant?

303
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,360
No wonder my kid started the company
that manufactures evil robots.

304
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,800
If I'd never left 2016, my child
would have had a loving father

305
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,200
and Palmer Tech might not have gone
on to build a robot army

306
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,280
that Savage uses
to conquer the world.

307
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,160
Bit of a stretch, don't you think?

308
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:43,640
Either way, I was someone's father
and didn't even know it.

309
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,520
- Hey.
- Hey.

310
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,400
Are you okay?

311
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,240
Fine. I'm fine.

312
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,760
You don't look fine.

313
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,360
I'm just a little... peckish.

314
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,440
Peckish?

315
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,760
It's nothing a little energy bar
won't fix.

316
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,680
I'll see you.

317
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:20,520
Edith and Joseph Boardman?

318
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,840
Our new names.

319
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,640
Joe Boardman is a good name.

320
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,360
And besides,
I've never kissed an Edith before,

321
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,800
but I certainly think
I can get used to that.

322
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,320
And what about all this?

323
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,440
How do we explain to our son

324
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,680
why his mother and father keep
moving every couple of years,

325
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,480
changing their names, looking over
their shoulders at every turn?

326
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,680
I don't know why we thought
we could do this again.

327
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,520
Do you think we're selfish?

328
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,680
To have a family?

329
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,240
Because when Savage finds us...

330
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,600
- He won't.
- He always finds us.

331
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,600
Maybe this life is different.

332
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,560
Do you honestly believe that?

333
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,240
Look...

334
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:16,320
All I know is that Savage is not the
only thing that's immortal, my love.

335
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,760
So is this.

336
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:34,760
What do genocidal maniacs
dream about, I wonder?

337
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,760
<i>He's imagining himself
baking cookies with his mother.</i>

338
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,920
- Wait, you can monitor our dreams?
<i>- Of course.</i>

339
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,040
<i>For example, last night,</i>

340
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,280
<i>you had a rollicking fantasy
involving a young nurse.</i>

341
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,120
Okay, Gideon, enough.

342
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,480
Gideon, check the timeline
to make sure

343
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:53,280
that the kidnapping of the boy had
the desired effect upon the future.

344
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,480
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

345
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,400
<i>I'm afraid you'll be disappointed
with the results.</i>

346
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,640
What do you mean it did nothing?

347
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,720
I mean, that kidnapping Per Degaton

348
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,480
had a nominal effect
upon the timeline.

349
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,880
Maybe we need to dump the little brat

350
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,800
somewhere he can't get into
any trouble, like the Stone Age.

351
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,440
<i>No matter where and when
you sequester him in the timeline,</i>

352
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,040
<i>Savage will still rise to power.</i>

353
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,760
But Rip said this kid's
like a baby Hitler.

354
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,640
Yes, I also said
that time wants to happen

355
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,400
and such a world-changing event
like Savage's rise to power

356
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,200
can't be stopped merely
by kidnapping his young pawn.

357
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,800
So we're back to plan A?

358
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,360
Snuffing the kid out in his sleep?

359
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,400
Let us not forget that this kid

360
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:37,320
will one day be responsible
for billions of deaths,

361
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,400
including those of my family.

362
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,800
Say that you do stop Savage
and save the lives of your family.

363
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,360
Will you be able
to look your own son in the eye

364
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:47,120
knowing what you did,
so he could live?

365
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,480
When the alternative is that
I shall never see him again.

366
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,880
I got a better idea.

367
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,080
Instead of us arguing about
whether we should kill him,

368
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,400
or where and when to dump him off,
why don't we just talk to him?

369
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,600
Savage has spent years
corrupting his mind.

370
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,680
It's not too late
for Per Degaton to change.

371
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,920
Says who?

372
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,280
Says someone with two tours
with the League of Assassins

373
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,280
and a case of bloodlust
under her belt.

374
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,480
Finally, someone who's willing
to do a man's job.

375
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,440
Not why I'm here.

376
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,680
It's almost funny how you guys
keep parading in here

377
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:31,160
like it's some kind of confessional
or something.

378
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,640
It's also not why I'm here.

379
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,000
Okay, I'll bite.

380
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,640
Everybody's out there arguing

381
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,720
about whether or not
we should kill this kid,

382
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,840
'cause no one thinks he can change,

383
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,880
which made me think of you.

384
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,240
You know no one thinks
you can change.

385
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,160
That's why you're in here.

386
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,840
The only reason
I'm in here is if I get out,

387
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,880
I'm gonna give Snart some payback
he's not walking away from.

388
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,040
He saved your life.

389
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,360
He wussed out on killing me,
not the same thing.

390
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,080
He marooned me.

391
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,520
It's not like he had many choices.

392
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:13,240
You know, while you were busy selling
us out to a homicidal time pirate,

393
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,600
Leonard and I almost died.

394
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,360
He was thinking about you,

395
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,080
told me about your partnership,
your friendship.

396
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,080
Did it make you weepy?

397
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,520
You think it's gonna make me weepy?

398
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,520
He's your friend, a loyal one.

399
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,680
You should know that.

400
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,560
Well, thank you.

401
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,040
I'll work it out with him
as soon as I can.

402
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,840
Oh, killing a kid,
not very hero-like.

403
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,120
Mr. Degaton.

404
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,600
For the last 50 years,

405
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:18,560
everyone inside the Conglomerate
has submitted biosamples,

406
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,320
so they can be tracked
and monitored at all times.

407
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,400
But these three...

408
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,200
Are not from the Conglomerate,

409
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,040
nor are they even
from the last 50 years.

410
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,120
How do you know?

411
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,920
Long story.

412
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,760
What's important is that
I can get your son back.

413
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,680
How do you know
they haven't killed him already?

414
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,720
Because I know the people
who kidnapped him

415
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,080
and they are weak...

416
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,600
squeamish in matters of death.

417
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,320
Who are you?

418
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,440
That's an excellent question.

419
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,800
What was that?

420
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,200
That was our jump ship taking off.

421
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,520
How could Per Degaton have escaped?

422
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,560
Gideon, who else is on the jump ship?

423
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,920
<i>It's being piloted by Captain Hunter.</i>

424
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,120
Who just turned off his transponder.

425
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,680
Sounds like someone
doesn't want us following him.

426
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,760
Why?

427
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,600
Because Rip doesn't want us
stopping him.

428
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,880
Stopping him from doing what?

429
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,600
From killing Per Degaton.

430
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,360
Okay, just think about this.

431
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,320
Where could Rip be taking
Per Degaton?

432
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:06,280
Jump ship's got a range of 8,000m,
so... anywhere.

433
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,360
It doesn't matter
where he's taking him.

434
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,000
All that matters is what he's gonna
do to him when he gets there.

435
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,400
Rip is not a murderer.

436
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,280
To Captain Hunter,
this isn't about a killing.

437
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,680
It's about saving.

438
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,760
Saving?

439
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,680
His son's life for Per Degaton's.

440
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:28,040
Rather simple if cold-blooded
calculus for a father to undertake.

441
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,680
Do you know who I am?

442
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,960
- My father is going to...
- Thank me?

443
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,440
I imagine there's a sizeable reward
for your safe return.

444
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,760
Relax.

445
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,720
You'll soon be home.

446
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,960
Come on, honey. We got to get moving

447
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,360
or the train is going to leave
without us.

448
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,720
Where are we going?

449
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,640
We are going on a little trip.

450
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,680
Just think of it
as one of your adventures.

451
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,920
The bad man found us,

452
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,600
the one that you and Mommy talk
about when I'm asleep?

453
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,840
Why is Vandal Savage chasing us?

454
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,840
It's time that he knew.

455
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,760
Come on.

456
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,840
Can you keep a secret, Aldus?

457
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:33,800
There's something... special
about your mommy and daddy.

458
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,560
We've known each other
for a very, very long time

459
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,280
and loved one another
since the day we met.

460
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,560
I already know that story.

461
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,880
You know part of that story.

462
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,040
Have you ever heard of a place
called Egypt?

463
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,360
Well, it all began
during the rule of Ramses II,

464
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,480
when late one night a big,
magical meteor

465
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,400
smashed into the Temple
of Horus, the hawk-god.

466
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,280
- Hey, you okay?
- Hey.

467
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,120
Yeah, I'm fine.

468
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,400
I was just thinking.

469
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,600
What are you thinking about?

470
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,560
Let me into that
4,000-year-old mind of yours.

471
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,800
The flashes I've been having,
they aren't of Savage.

472
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,880
They're of Carter.

473
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,880
And they're not just memories.

474
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,800
They're feelings too.

475
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,720
Oh, well, I get that.

476
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,200
It must be really weird feeling like
you're cheating on me with him.

477
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,200
No, Ray.

478
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,440
I feel like I'm cheating on him
with you.

479
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,160
I'm sorry.

480
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,760
No, it's... it's okay.

481
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,640
I mean,
I knew what I was getting into.

482
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,840
The last 206 times you fell in love,
it was with the same guy.

483
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:11,120
I guess this isn't a great time to
talk about what's been bothering you.

484
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,120
You're not the only perceptive one.

485
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,920
So what's wrong?

486
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:28,160
Turns out that I had a child
I didn't know about back in 2016

487
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,120
and here in the future,

488
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,000
my great-great-great-great
granddaughter

489
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,040
creates the army of robot Gestapos

490
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:40,000
that Savage will one day use
to destroy the world.

491
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,280
Why didn't you tell me?

492
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,520
I didn't want you
to think less of me.

493
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:53,360
Ray, how could I ever think
less of you?

494
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,280
Well, now that we've got
that off our chests...

495
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,960
What does that mean for us?

496
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,720
No luck finding our homicidal
captain?

497
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,040
Gideon's still searching,

498
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,600
but I have a feeling Rip's not gonna
be found if he doesn't want to be.

499
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,560
So what are you doing down here?

500
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,840
Don't you think you at least
owe him a conversation?

501
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,200
We had our conversation
while he was Chronos

502
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,800
and he made his feelings
about me very clear.

503
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,240
And what about your feelings?

504
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,400
About you?

505
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,480
About Mick.

506
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,360
I don't have any feelings about Mick.

507
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,800
Look, it didn't seem that way

508
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:40,920
when we were dying in
the engine room of hypothermia.

509
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,480
Look, if you want to ease
your guilty conscience,

510
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,840
that's your business.

511
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,880
But he's still the same
son of a bitch he was

512
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,080
when you all wanted me
to put him down.

513
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,040
I wasn't the one
who mentioned marooning, Rory.

514
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,280
You did.

515
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,880
It's obviously still weighing
on your conscience.

516
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,200
So stop being an ass
and go deal with it.

517
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,600
This isn't Kasnia.

518
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,520
I thought a neutral site
would be best for this.

519
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,600
For what?

520
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,160
Exchanging me?

521
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,920
Did your father ever teach you
to swim, Per Degaton?

522
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,440
No, I imagine he had someone
do it for him, didn't he?

523
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,600
You're hardly lacking in tutors,
are you...

524
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,240
such as Mr. Savage.

525
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,760
What are you talking about?

526
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,720
My son Jonas
always wanted to learn to swim.

527
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,000
I promised him that I'd teach him,

528
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:49,160
but there never seemed to be... time.

529
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,920
My son never learned to swim,

530
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,560
because he was killed.

531
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,960
So... you brought me here to kill me.

532
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:06,120
I brought you here to save my son's
life, your life in exchange for his.

533
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,680
I'm sorry.

534
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,080
No, you're not.

535
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,520
You're not sorry

536
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,320
because you're not going to kill me.

537
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,520
I have to.

538
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,760
To save my wife and son, I have to.

539
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,440
I don't expect you to understand.

540
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,360
It doesn't matter if I understand.

541
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,960
I can see it in your eyes.

542
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,840
You're not going to do it.

543
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:33,320
You're like my father, weak.

544
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,640
Vandal Savage has taught me
many things,

545
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,280
including what a killer looks like.

546
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,960
You're not a killer.

547
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,680
Your tutor has taught you well

548
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,000
despite his ill intentions.

549
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,120
Vandal loves me.

550
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,360
Oh, he wants to use you as his pawn

551
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,920
and ultimately, he will betray you.

552
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,640
No. No, he wouldn't.

553
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,080
I've said to myself time
and time again

554
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,520
that there is nothing that I wouldn't
do to save my wife and son,

555
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:14,040
but now I know that there is.

556
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,920
My reticence to kill you,
Per Degaton, is not weakness.

557
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,480
It is goodness.

558
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,760
And if there is a shred
of goodness inside of me,

559
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,200
then I have to believe that there is
a shred of goodness inside of you.

560
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,400
Be the man that your father
wants you to be,

561
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,320
not the man Savage wants you to be.

562
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,480
Savage, he's coming.

563
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,360
Gideon?

564
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,840
<i>Tor Degaton's forces
have surrounded the ship.</i>

565
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,240
<i>I'm afraid our shields
will not be able to sustain</i>

566
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,320
<i>continued bombardment.</i>

567
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,400
You're afraid?

568
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,160
Here's an idea.
Why don't you fire back?

569
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,280
<i>I would, except...</i>

570
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,760
The flying robots already
targeted our weapons systems.

571
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,000
We don't need weapons.

572
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,080
He's right.

573
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,520
We have super powers.

574
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,600
I think this is yours.

575
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,240
I'll draw their fire.

576
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,440
You handle the ground troops.

577
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,480
Ray, are you all right?

578
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,560
So this is what it feels
like to be last year's model.

579
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,640
They're too fast.

580
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,000
We have to find another way.

581
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,600
Forget about them.

582
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,680
We'll hold off the robots.

583
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,240
We'll take out their command center.

584
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,880
Who are you?

585
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,720
Yeah.

586
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,120
<i>Ray, hurry up.</i>

587
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,200
I can only hold them back
for so long.

588
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,160
Where did you get your suit?

589
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,920
Look, if you don't let us disable
your evil robot army,

590
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,640
then the whole world
will be destroyed.

591
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,720
They're designed to bring peace.

592
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,480
I know.

593
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,760
I designed the robots.

594
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,840
What?

595
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:25,000
I am your great-great-great-great
grandfather.

596
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,720
The guy you have a bust of
in your lobby,

597
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,800
father of the robotics industry.

598
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,240
You're trying to tell me
that you're Sidney Palmer?

599
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,400
Sidney?

600
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:40,480
Wait, the bust in your lobby
is of my stupid brother?

601
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,880
Of course.

602
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,000
He must have gone to work for
Felicity in 2016 after I vanished.

603
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,720
He allowed my tech to be perverted
by the defense industry.

604
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,560
That is so Sidney.

605
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,600
So that means that she's not...

606
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:56,240
I'm not a father.

607
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,480
So we still need your help
disabling the robots.

608
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,880
And why should I believe you?

609
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:10,600
Because if you have even a drop
of Palmer blood in your veins,

610
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,880
you'll do what's right.

611
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,720
Looks like Raymond was able
to sabotage his robot army.

612
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,080
Which means mopping up the rest of
these guys shouldn't be a problem.

613
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,600
Oh, it will be a problem.

614
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,320
What do you want?

615
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:40,880
I want to exchange this woman's life
for your captain, Rip Hunter.

616
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:46,160
I have a better idea,
her life in exchange for his.

617
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,240
Your son will be returned to you

618
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,280
as soon as you guarantee
our safe passage.

619
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,880
Don't do it, father.

620
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,280
If you let them go now,

621
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,440
they will only come back for us
in the future.

622
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,720
It's your choice.

623
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,040
Your son is right.

624
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,640
We should kill them all.

625
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,440
Put down your weapons!

626
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,560
No, father.

627
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:17,120
Let my son go
and I will let you leave in peace.

628
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,400
You have my word.

629
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,800
Better find yourself a new mentor,
kid.

630
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,720
What do you want?

631
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,240
People seem to think
we should have a heart-to-heart.

632
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,480
We don't have hearts.

633
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,680
Where does that leave us?

634
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,760
I've got a dozen reasons
for killing you.

635
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,280
You've got a dozen
and one for killing me, so...

636
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,080
All the talk in the world
is not gonna change a thing.

637
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,280
Exactly, here's my proposal.

638
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:20,080
I open this cell,
we let our fists do the talking.

639
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,160
When I kill you...

640
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:32,080
You take the jump ship,
make your escape,

641
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,640
live out the rest of your life
anywhere you like.

642
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,960
And if you kill me, well,

643
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,200
it's better than being
locked up in this place

644
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,480
like some kind of circus freak.

645
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,480
I take that as a yes.

646
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,880
Sound the bell.

647
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,160
Hey.

648
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,840
You don't have to knock.

649
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,080
It's your room too.

650
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,160
Yeah, I know.

651
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,880
It's just... things have been weird.

652
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:10,000
Since I told you I had a love child
that I didn't really have,

653
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,720
or since you told me
that you're still in love with...

654
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,160
You know what I love about you, Ray,

655
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,960
is you always manage to find
the bright side.

656
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,160
And no matter what,
you never give up.

657
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,120
So please, don't give up on us.

658
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,480
I'm not giving up,

659
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,560
but it's hard to ignore the math.

660
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,920
You and Carter have
spent lifetimes together

661
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,960
and in each one,
you've fallen in love.

662
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,720
So why would this lifetime
be any different?

663
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:46,160
Well, I never met you before.

664
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:50,760
Look, Ray, Carter is my past.

665
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,360
You are my future.

666
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,840
Vandal.

667
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,960
Oh, I didn't expect you up
and about so soon.

668
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:17,680
My father wanted me to rest,
but I wanted to resume my studies.

669
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,000
Oh, good boy.

670
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,000
So... where should we begin?

671
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,920
Well, I was thinking Greek mythology.

672
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,440
Do you know the tale
of Oedipus Rex?

673
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:30,280
He was a prince of thieves
before his father exiled him.

674
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,760
Why?

675
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,320
Well, because the king was a coward.

676
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:39,520
He had heard a prophecy that one day
his son would take his crown,

677
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,760
so he bound his boy's feet

678
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,000
and tossed him into the woods to die.

679
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,320
What did the boy do?

680
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,840
He did what he had to do.

681
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,520
And one day, the prophecy came true

682
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:56,640
and the prince became a great
and powerful king.

683
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,200
Though it wasn't easy.

684
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,040
Great things are never easy.

685
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:17,240
<i>Unfortunately, our interactions
have done nothing to halt</i>

686
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,040
<i>Per Degaton's rise to power.</i>

687
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,040
<i>If anything,
we've merely cemented it.</i>

688
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,920
<i>In fact, the virus,</i>

689
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,880
<i>which wasn't supposed to be
unleashed upon the world</i>

690
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,160
<i>for another five years...</i>

691
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,440
I'm sorry, Father.

692
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,560
<i>Will now be released
in a matter of days.</i>

693
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,160
As you all know,
our former chairman's chair

694
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:48,040
is in the Conglomerate
passed to his son,

695
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:51,480
who due to his age elected me
to act as his proxy.

696
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,680
First order of business,

697
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,400
I would like to revisit our
discussion

698
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,440
concerning the population crisis
beyond the Conglomerate's borders.

699
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:07,440
As we all know,
we already have a solution.

700
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,440
Did I do the right thing, Gideon?

701
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,280
<i>Not committing murder is generally
considered the right thing, Captain.</i>

702
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,560
In this instance...

703
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,760
I wonder.

704
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,640
We had a deal, Mick.

705
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,040
Kill me and you walk.

706
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,520
It's what you wanted, isn't it,
to get off the team?

707
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,720
I don't know what I want anymore.

708
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,560
Truth is, it doesn't matter.

709
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,920
What are you talking about?

710
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,040
Whether I stay or leave, I'm dead.

711
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,880
We're all dead.

712
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,960
Since I failed to bring you in,

713
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,640
the Time Master's want to
bring me in

714
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:21,160
and this time, they're not
gonna take any chances.

715
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,880
They're called the Hunters,
mercenaries

716
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,200
and unlike me, there isn't
a human part left in them.

717
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,600
So they want to lock us all up
in the Vanishing Point?

718
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:35,160
The Hunters do one thing, kill,
whenever, wherever

719
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,440
and they'll stop at nothing
'til every single one of us

720
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,400
is erased from the face of history.

721
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:45,960
Do you have any suggestions as to
how we might outsmart them, Mr. Rory?

722
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,400
Run.
