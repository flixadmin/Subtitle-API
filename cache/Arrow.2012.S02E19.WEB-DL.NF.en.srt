I was never able to replicate
the <i>Mirakuru</i> serum...

320
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:44,595
...from the original Japanese
World War II research I discovered.

321
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:49,058
After conducting experiments on the prisoners
that I acquired this past year...

322
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:52,686
...I was able to synthesize a solution...

323
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,688
...that counteracts...

00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:56,398
...reverses...

325
00:21:56,607 --> 00:22:01,070
...the physiological effects
that exposure to<i>Mirakuru</i> produces.

326
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,656
From more than human...

327
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,032

Just giving you the chance
to do the right thing.

338

of a Fortune 500 company.

-I don't care.

-I don't see them ordering hostile takeovers.
-"Fooled around"?

346

Is that what your mother told you?

Of course she would write me off
as a meaningless affair.

348

Slade Wilson put me through hell.
His training nearly killed me.

349
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:43,421
Would I have put myself through that
because I was a jilted lover?

Honestly, I don't know what you are.

351

-Our bags were packed.
-Really?

355

Then your sister had to go and break her arm,
doing something ridiculous, no doubt.

that Thea wasn't even his.

Of course he knew.

He was a fool, not an idiot.

And like a fool, he loved her anyway.

He promised me
that we would leave the next day.

But instead my internship was terminated
and he never spoke to me again.
