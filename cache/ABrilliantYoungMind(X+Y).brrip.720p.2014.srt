1
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,385
I find any communication

2
00:01:02,517 --> 00:01:06,025
of a non-mathematical
nature very difficult.

3
00:01:08,266 --> 00:01:12,592
Because I don't talk much, people think
I don't have anything to say,

4
00:01:12,725 --> 00:01:14,444
or that I'm stupid.

5
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,640
And that's not true.

6
00:01:18,433 --> 00:01:20,566
I have lots of things to say.

7
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,568
I'm just afraid to say them.

8
00:01:28,808 --> 00:01:31,523
I know that I'm strange in lots of ways.

9
00:01:33,141 --> 00:01:38,558
I think I see the world
in a different way to other people.

10
00:01:41,016 --> 00:01:43,055
I've always been like that.

11
00:01:58,308 --> 00:01:59,647
Would you like to play with it?

12
00:02:01,224 --> 00:02:02,884
Are you scared it will eat you?

13
00:02:03,766 --> 00:02:04,762
No.

14
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:06,932
Is it because it's a toy?

15
00:02:07,974 --> 00:02:10,724
No. Because stegosauruses
aren't carnivores.

16
00:02:14,433 --> 00:02:17,183
So, Nathan, what do you like?

17
00:02:18,724 --> 00:02:20,692
I imagine there's things
that you don't like.

18
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:24,859
Maybe, say, when meal times change?

19
00:02:25,308 --> 00:02:28,472
Yes. Yes, he is fussy about his food.

20
00:02:29,266 --> 00:02:30,226
Nathan?

21
00:02:31,474 --> 00:02:32,565
Nathan?

22
00:02:34,474 --> 00:02:36,940
I... I like patterns.

23
00:02:37,641 --> 00:02:39,975
And what does it feel like
to see a good pattern?

24
00:02:40,974 --> 00:02:42,065
Nice.

25
00:02:43,641 --> 00:02:45,229
They're pretty colours.

26
00:02:48,349 --> 00:02:50,933
So, it's positive.
Nathan is certainly on the spectrum.

27
00:02:51,391 --> 00:02:53,892
Traits of autism combined
with synaesthesia,

28
00:02:54,016 --> 00:02:56,054
sensitive to a change in light and pattern.

29
00:02:57,016 --> 00:03:01,437
These can be gifts, of course, but they
do come with some big challenges,

30
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:05,006
socially and emotionally, which will
stay with Nathan all of his life.

31
00:03:06,182 --> 00:03:09,561
But there is no question;
That he's a unique young man.

32
00:03:20,016 --> 00:03:22,481
Give Mum a wave. Bye, Mum.

33
00:03:22,599 --> 00:03:23,595
Bye.

34
00:03:28,891 --> 00:03:29,922
Bye.

35
00:03:32,766 --> 00:03:34,306
You know what I was thinking?

36
00:03:36,307 --> 00:03:39,342
You know, sometimes it might seem like

37
00:03:39,474 --> 00:03:42,046
we don't always understand
what it's like to be you.

38
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,594
It's like you've got these special powers,

39
00:03:46,724 --> 00:03:48,134
like a wizard.

40
00:03:49,349 --> 00:03:52,513
And we're just Muggles
that don't understand how you do it.

41
00:03:54,724 --> 00:03:56,348
It's like a different language to us.

42
00:03:59,307 --> 00:04:02,815
But even though we don't always
understand each other, Nath,

43
00:04:04,515 --> 00:04:07,645
it doesn't mean that any of us
ever stops loving each other.

44
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,860
Does that make sense?

45
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,731
Nathan, look at me.

46
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:19,527
But you shouldn't be afraid.

47
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,047
<i> Sweetheart

48
00:05:10,598 --> 00:05:13,514
<i> What have you done to us?

49
00:05:19,182 --> 00:05:25,925
<i> I turned my back and you turned to dust

50
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,891
<i> What have you done?

51
00:05:34,015 --> 00:05:35,804
<i> And, Oh, please

52
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:40,469
<i> Just come here, don't fight with me

53
00:05:45,307 --> 00:05:47,274
<i> And I admit

54
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:51,671
<i> Think you may have broken It

55
00:05:52,848 --> 00:05:54,887
<i> Yeah, I admit <i>

56
00:06:18,556 --> 00:06:21,934
Come here, darling. Come here.

57
00:06:24,223 --> 00:06:25,563
Just hold my hand.

58
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,717
Please, Nathan.
Nathan, just hold my hand. Just this once.

59
00:06:34,848 --> 00:06:37,254
It's okay. We'll do this together.

60
00:06:37,598 --> 00:06:40,265
Come here, darling. Darling, come on.

61
00:06:40,973 --> 00:06:43,723
Nathan. Please, don't. No, Nathan!

62
00:07:00,723 --> 00:07:01,754
Hey.

63
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:06,144
Gosh.

64
00:07:07,348 --> 00:07:08,687
That looks complicated.

65
00:07:09,723 --> 00:07:11,192
That's not schoolwork then?

66
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,565
Wait, why don't you try
and explain it to me?

67
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:17,067
I might be able to help you.

68
00:07:17,764 --> 00:07:18,796
Hmm?

69
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,420
You can't.

70
00:07:22,556 --> 00:07:23,717
Why not?

71
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:26,800
You're not clever enough.

72
00:07:31,431 --> 00:07:33,469
So, Nathan, this is the big school.

73
00:07:34,556 --> 00:07:36,879
When you're older,
you'll go here every single day.

74
00:07:37,014 --> 00:07:38,294
Watch out.

75
00:07:39,014 --> 00:07:40,852
We're just gonna start things early.

76
00:07:41,473 --> 00:07:42,973
It's nothing to be frightened about.

77
00:07:44,848 --> 00:07:47,313
Don't run in the corridor.

78
00:07:48,722 --> 00:07:49,849
Excuse me.

79
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:51,919
Excuse me!

80
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:01,722
There you go.

81
00:08:04,014 --> 00:08:05,223
Oh, that's subtle.

82
00:08:06,306 --> 00:08:08,344
- Ah, really subtle.
- What? We're not... We're not doing anything.

83
00:08:08,472 --> 00:08:10,381
"We're not... We're not...
We're not doing anything."

84
00:08:10,514 --> 00:08:11,474
Give me that now!

85
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:21,799
Is this drugs?

86
00:08:25,847 --> 00:08:26,973
Go on, piss off.

87
00:08:32,514 --> 00:08:34,014
We're so lucky.

88
00:08:46,722 --> 00:08:48,133
- Mr. Humphreys.
- Yep.

89
00:08:48,264 --> 00:08:49,734
- Can I have a quick word?
- Yeah.

90
00:08:54,972 --> 00:08:56,762
How old are you? 5?

91
00:08:57,722 --> 00:08:59,441
No, Nathan is 9.

92
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,130
His mum got in touch because
of Nathan's rather advanced interest

93
00:09:03,264 --> 00:09:06,807
in numbers and patterns and his primary
schoolwork was no longer testing.

94
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,680
Mmm, I can see why, yeah. Bit of algebra.

95
00:09:11,139 --> 00:09:13,012
Mmm, distance geometry.

96
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:14,799
Where'd you learn all this, mate?

97
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,712
Mr. Humphreys just joined
our maths department.

98
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,692
He was a bit of a maths whizz
when he was young, Nathan.

99
00:09:21,805 --> 00:09:24,555
- Not really, it was a long time ago.
- No, no, no.

100
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,845
He competed in the International
Mathematical Olympiad.

101
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:31,554
- Olympiad?
- Olympiad, yes. The IMO.

102
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,837
Did you know you could win
medals for maths, Nathan?

103
00:09:36,305 --> 00:09:40,596
Just like sport, only for people who
are really, really strong up here instead.

104
00:09:42,055 --> 00:09:45,682
Mrs. Ellis, if Mr. Humphreys is willing

105
00:09:46,263 --> 00:09:50,803
I think that we can absolutely begin offering
Nathan some special advanced tuition.

106
00:09:52,055 --> 00:09:53,300
Can't we?

107
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,592
Okay, yeah.

108
00:10:09,888 --> 00:10:11,548
Why don't you walk properly?

109
00:10:13,055 --> 00:10:14,596
That's very direct of you.

110
00:10:17,347 --> 00:10:19,480
I've got multiple sclerosis.

111
00:10:21,222 --> 00:10:22,691
What about you?

112
00:10:23,513 --> 00:10:24,544
Why are you weird?

113
00:10:25,972 --> 00:10:29,883
- I've got special powers.
- Mmm-hmm.

114
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,055
Can you fly?

115
00:10:32,847 --> 00:10:34,435
Can you turn things to ice?

116
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,185
Are you really good at maths?

117
00:10:37,472 --> 00:10:39,380
Ah, yeah. Ah, fair play.

118
00:10:39,638 --> 00:10:42,424
Well, listen, I should tell you,
I'm not a very good teacher.

119
00:10:43,388 --> 00:10:45,640
I barely encourage myself
to get out of bed,

120
00:10:45,763 --> 00:10:47,553
let alone inspire some kid
with special powers

121
00:10:47,638 --> 00:10:49,179
who wants to spend
all his spare time doing maths.

122
00:10:49,305 --> 00:10:50,514
So as long as we're clear.

123
00:10:52,221 --> 00:10:52,910
What's that for?

124
00:10:52,937 --> 00:10:55,258
It's to give it a shake.
It's my hand, isn't it?

125
00:10:55,346 --> 00:10:58,132
- It's what men do when they agree.
- I don't like doing that.

126
00:10:58,263 --> 00:11:00,586
Yeah, well, we all have
to do things we don't like doing,

127
00:11:00,596 --> 00:11:02,638
but we fucking do them, don't we?
So give it here.

128
00:11:03,888 --> 00:11:05,477
What does "fucking" mean?

129
00:11:06,346 --> 00:11:07,591
All in good time, son.

130
00:11:09,096 --> 00:11:10,057
Right then.

131
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,088
We'll start with some
probability, shall we?

132
00:11:13,596 --> 00:11:16,180
Like what's the probability of me
remembering any of this shit.

133
00:11:17,596 --> 00:11:18,592
I can't hear you.

134
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:23,960
I said, let's do tree diagrams, shall we?

135
00:11:24,596 --> 00:11:26,007
Mr. Humphreys?

136
00:11:26,305 --> 00:11:27,715
Yes, Mr. Ellis.

137
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:30,093
What was the Olympiad like?

138
00:11:31,638 --> 00:11:33,226
Mind your own business, nosy.

139
00:11:34,888 --> 00:11:35,978
Boom.

140
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:38,431
Do you know what this means?

141
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:41,179
Go on, Sir Nod-A-Lot, tell me,
what does it mean?

142
00:11:41,346 --> 00:11:42,307
A toss.

143
00:11:43,096 --> 00:11:44,057
Toss?

144
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:45,841
How dare you?

145
00:11:47,013 --> 00:11:48,553
Yeah, the coin toss. Well done.

00:12:57,804 --> 00:13:02,474
"And let P denote
the perimeter of the hexagon."

164
00:13:02,596 --> 00:13:04,812
Nathan! Breakfast!

165
00:13:07,012 --> 00:13:11,149
"Prove that RA plus RC plus RE"

166
00:13:11,262 --> 00:13:15,090
"is greater than or equal to P over 2."

167
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:19,389
Here.

168
00:13:20,887 --> 00:13:23,898
- It doesn't matter if you don't get in.
- Of course it matters.

169
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:28,262
Got twisted. Okay? Good.

170
00:13:31,345 --> 00:13:32,377
Good luck.

171
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,343
Get a job.
You get a job.

172
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:39,007
I'm trying. I've handed CVs out.
You've got a CV?

173
00:13:39,137 --> 00:13:41,768
Yeah, obviously. I don't wanna
sit on me arse all day, you know.

174
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:44,424
- And even If I do, you're sat next to me.
- No, I'm not.

175
00:13:44,554 --> 00:13:46,213
Yeah, you are.
Joined at the friggin' hip.

176
00:13:46,345 --> 00:13:49,095
Are you listening to our conversation? Eh?

177
00:13:50,304 --> 00:13:51,549
- No.
- What?

178
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,938
- No, I wasn't.
- Are you sure about that?

179
00:13:55,637 --> 00:13:56,917
- Better not be.
- No.

180
00:14:27,803 --> 00:14:28,835
- You're late.
- Sorry, mate.

181
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:31,601
I had a quick look at it first. Shh.

182
00:14:32,345 --> 00:14:33,756
It's a piece of piss, really.

183
00:14:34,345 --> 00:14:35,815
Well, not really, but...

184
00:14:36,303 --> 00:14:38,520
You know, just do your best.

185
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:41,803
It's the biggest day of
your life, mate, innit?

186
00:14:42,845 --> 00:14:44,090
Don't feel any pressure.

187
00:14:44,803 --> 00:14:46,427
I'm a bit nervous.

188
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:47,585
Are you nervous?

189
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:49,624
- A little bit.
- Well, you shouldn't be.

190
00:14:49,637 --> 00:14:50,846
Because you're brilliant.

191
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:51,930
Are you ready?

192
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:53,430
Yeah.

193
00:14:53,678 --> 00:14:54,639
Yeah?

194
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:56,921
On your marks, get set...

195
00:14:57,595 --> 00:14:58,686
Go on, my son.

196
00:15:00,387 --> 00:15:02,105
I'll just be over there, out the way.

197
00:15:02,637 --> 00:15:04,012
"Question one."

198
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:07,680
"Are there infinitely many pairs of
positive integers (m, n) such..."

199
00:15:14,803 --> 00:15:15,799
"Question one."

200
00:15:15,928 --> 00:15:19,342
"Are there infinitely many pairs
of positive integers (m, n)"

201
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:22,137
"such that both m divides
n squared plus one and..."

202
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,805
"Are there infinitely many pairs
of positive integers (m, n)"

203
00:15:32,928 --> 00:15:38,131
"such that both m divides n squared plus one
and that n divides m squared plus one?"

204
00:15:47,261 --> 00:15:48,921
When will we find out?

205
00:15:49,053 --> 00:15:51,056
Uh, about a week, probably.

206
00:15:52,261 --> 00:15:55,840
It's all right, male. Relax to the max.
Take a chill pill.

207
00:15:57,428 --> 00:15:59,834
Talking of which, this hill's a killer.

208
00:16:00,178 --> 00:16:01,766
Do you mind if we take the weight off?

209
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:06,435
Can I ask you a question?
Hang on.

210
00:16:08,845 --> 00:16:11,476
Go on then, hit me.

211
00:16:12,428 --> 00:16:15,000
- Hit you?
- Ask me the fucking question!

212
00:16:18,261 --> 00:16:21,770
Why did things go wrong for you,
at the Olympiad?

213
00:16:23,761 --> 00:16:25,599
There's lots of reasons, really.

214
00:16:28,928 --> 00:16:31,061
My "thing" was kicking
off around that time.

215
00:16:32,803 --> 00:16:33,929
My ailment.

216
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:38,428
Cutting me down in the prime of my life.

217
00:16:40,594 --> 00:16:42,503
I just sort of lost it.

218
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,297
I can't lose it.

219
00:16:45,719 --> 00:16:49,299
Nathan, you haven't gotta
prove anything, all right?

220
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:54,519
What's important is that you enjoy doing
it, maths, and you do, don't you?

221
00:16:55,678 --> 00:16:58,060
So whether you get on the team or not,

222
00:16:58,178 --> 00:17:00,394
you're gonna do amazing
things in the future.

223
00:17:02,553 --> 00:17:03,513
You haven't.

224
00:17:05,428 --> 00:17:06,672
Well, thanks a lot.

225
00:17:08,344 --> 00:17:09,885
You charming little bastard.

226
00:17:15,053 --> 00:17:16,262
Hi. Hi.

227
00:17:16,761 --> 00:17:19,606
Um, can I order number 47, please,

228
00:17:19,719 --> 00:17:21,438
with, um,

229
00:17:21,552 --> 00:17:25,001
7 prawn balls
and a small chips, thank you.

230
00:17:27,969 --> 00:17:30,600
It come with 6 balls, number 47.

231
00:17:31,011 --> 00:17:32,919
Yeah, I know. Usually...

232
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:34,596
Sorry, are you new?

233
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,936
It's just we come here all the time

234
00:17:37,052 --> 00:17:39,684
and it's usually just fine,
you give us an extra ball.

235
00:17:39,802 --> 00:17:42,209
Number 48 is a large prawn ball meal.

236
00:17:42,344 --> 00:17:45,059
You get 9 balls, large
chips and crackers.

237
00:17:45,177 --> 00:17:46,303
Yeah, I know.

238
00:17:46,427 --> 00:17:47,933
No. Sorry.

239
00:17:48,052 --> 00:17:49,013
Sorry.

240
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:54,303
No, he doesn't like, um, crackers
and he likes to have a small chips.

241
00:17:54,427 --> 00:17:55,802
I'm sorry, it's just, uh...

242
00:17:56,594 --> 00:17:58,182
My son, he's quite picky

243
00:17:58,302 --> 00:18:02,474
and he needs the meal number
to be a prime number

244
00:18:02,594 --> 00:18:05,723
and there to be a prime number
of prawn balls.

245
00:18:05,844 --> 00:18:06,935
And, um,

246
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:10,561
if he had 9 balls
it wouldn't be a prime number

247
00:18:10,677 --> 00:18:12,550
and number 48 isn't...

248
00:18:12,677 --> 00:18:14,396
Isn't... Isn't a prime...

249
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:16,763
Is it? Is it? I don't know. Yes, I do.

250
00:18:17,594 --> 00:18:19,562
Um, yes, no, I'm right.

251
00:18:20,594 --> 00:18:21,590
47.

252
00:18:24,385 --> 00:18:26,104
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

253
00:18:37,594 --> 00:18:40,059
There we go. A big fat "well done".

254
00:18:44,219 --> 00:18:45,499
It's all spilt out.

255
00:18:48,219 --> 00:18:49,179
Oh.

256
00:18:49,677 --> 00:18:53,719
No, no, it's fine.
Nathan, Nathan, don't get upset. It's fine.

257
00:18:53,844 --> 00:18:54,804
- No, Mum, it's not fine.
- It's fine.

258
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:56,677
- You don't do anything right.
- I'm sorry?

259
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:58,720
Everything you do is wrong.

260
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,391
Oh... Oh, well, I'm sorry, okay?

261
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,720
Thank you so much!

262
00:19:10,052 --> 00:19:11,178
Sorry.

263
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:24,139
That doctor didn't know his
herbivores from his carnivores, did he?

264
00:19:25,843 --> 00:19:27,005
And do you know why?

265
00:19:28,843 --> 00:19:30,432
Because he's not as smart as you.

266
00:19:35,302 --> 00:19:37,518
Is there someone else you know
that has what you have?

267
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,724
Einstein.

268
00:19:42,093 --> 00:19:43,054
Okay.

269
00:19:43,885 --> 00:19:44,845
But...

270
00:19:46,177 --> 00:19:47,552
I just want you to know

271
00:19:49,218 --> 00:19:51,221
that you're fine the way you are, Nathan.

272
00:20:00,677 --> 00:20:02,834
So do you want one of them
ice cream things for dessert or what?

273
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:04,059
- Dad!
- What?

274
00:20:04,177 --> 00:20:06,180
Oh, no! Not again. Ah!

275
00:20:06,302 --> 00:20:08,056
- What do I do? Do I lean forward?
- No, back!

276
00:20:08,177 --> 00:20:10,678
Back? Oh, no, this is a disaster.

277
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,418
I know. I know. Give me this.

278
00:20:32,051 --> 00:20:34,588
As promised, I come bearing news.

279
00:20:38,385 --> 00:20:41,261
Are you sure it's okay if I stand out here?
I don't wanna put you out.

280
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:44,753
- Yeah.
- Invite me in, Nathan.

281
00:20:47,135 --> 00:20:48,723
- Come in.
- Thank you very much.

282
00:20:52,801 --> 00:20:53,801
Put the kettle on, then.

283
00:20:55,593 --> 00:20:58,165
- Put the kettle on what?
- It's okay. I'll do it.

284
00:20:58,676 --> 00:21:00,928
- Hi, Julie.
- Hi, Mr. Humphreys.

285
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,924
- How are you?
- Very good, thank you.

286
00:21:03,635 --> 00:21:05,176
- Thanks for coming round.
- I got it.

287
00:21:05,218 --> 00:21:07,541
Oh! Oh, my goodness.
Is that what I think it is?

288
00:21:07,676 --> 00:21:09,430
I hope so, otherwise it would have
been a wasted journey.

289
00:21:11,426 --> 00:21:13,086
Um, you open it.

290
00:21:13,218 --> 00:21:15,176
- You want me to open it? All right then.
- Yeah.

291
00:21:18,884 --> 00:21:22,760
Dear Mr. Ellis, I am writing to let you
know that unfortunately...

292
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:29,463
"...you have successfully earned a place
on the United Kingdom maths squad!"

293
00:21:29,593 --> 00:21:31,809
Oh, my goodness! Oh, Nathan, darling.

294
00:21:31,926 --> 00:21:33,336
- Well, that's good news, isn't it?
- Oh, my gosh!

295
00:21:33,468 --> 00:21:35,176
- Well done, mate.
- Oh, well done.

296
00:21:35,634 --> 00:21:36,760
Why is that unfortunate?

297
00:21:36,884 --> 00:21:37,916
No, I was having a joke, mate.

298
00:21:38,051 --> 00:21:39,770
It says the training camp's
in Taiwan this year.

299
00:21:39,884 --> 00:21:42,207
- Have you ever been on a plane before?
- No. He's not.

300
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:44,381
- Well, that's exciting, isn't it?
- Um...

301
00:21:45,218 --> 00:21:46,178
But...

302
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:48,264
I should study.

303
00:21:49,634 --> 00:21:52,585
- Are you leaving now, or...
- Nathan.

304
00:21:53,509 --> 00:21:54,540
He doesn't mean that.

305
00:21:55,634 --> 00:21:56,760
Probably, yeah.

306
00:21:57,384 --> 00:21:58,415
- Okay.
- Well...

307
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,710
- I'm gonna go and study.
- Okay.

308
00:22:01,301 --> 00:22:02,427
Well done, mate.

309
00:22:02,718 --> 00:22:04,756
- He is pleased. He's...
- I know he is, yeah.

310
00:22:05,884 --> 00:22:09,167
I'm gonna have something stronger
than a cup of tea, actually, I think.

311
00:22:09,426 --> 00:22:10,966
- I'm gonna have a glass of wine.
- Okay.

312
00:22:11,092 --> 00:22:12,053
Would you like...

313
00:22:12,176 --> 00:22:13,646
I should probably shoot off.

314
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:15,039
Okay, no, that's fine.

315
00:22:15,176 --> 00:22:16,717
But I mean, if you're gonna have one.

316
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:27,046
Actually, I was thinking maybe,
you know you'd like to...

317
00:22:27,842 --> 00:22:30,165
To join us next month,

318
00:22:30,301 --> 00:22:31,545
take him to the airport.

319
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:34,636
I know that would make Nathan happy.

320
00:22:41,134 --> 00:22:43,102
I should probably tell you before they...

321
00:22:43,592 --> 00:22:45,560
I'm taking a bit of a break from work.

322
00:22:46,009 --> 00:22:48,296
Uh, it's a bit of a forced break.

323
00:22:48,426 --> 00:22:50,583
It's a bit like I'm being fired, basically.

324
00:22:52,217 --> 00:22:53,213
I'm sorry.

325
00:22:53,592 --> 00:22:55,583
But I wanted to say to you
even though I'm not working

326
00:22:55,592 --> 00:22:58,437
for the school any more, I'd really
like to carry on teaching Nathan.

327
00:22:58,551 --> 00:23:00,802
- Really?
- Yeah. I mean, if that's all right with you?

328
00:23:01,884 --> 00:23:03,926
- That would be amazing.
- Obviously for no money.

329
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:06,457
Oh! Jesus Christ!

330
00:23:10,967 --> 00:23:11,928
Oh, my God!

331
00:23:12,967 --> 00:23:14,135
That's a bit of a weird one.

332
00:23:14,592 --> 00:23:16,510
- Thanks for the drink and stuff.
- Not at all.

333
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:19,175
- Don't worry about it. All right.
- Yeah, no, good.

334
00:23:19,425 --> 00:23:21,334
- Will you be all right? Okay.
- Yeah. Cheers, Julie. Thank you.

335
00:23:21,467 --> 00:23:22,925
- Thank you. Take care.
- All right.

336
00:23:34,675 --> 00:23:36,181
We were just talking, Nathan.

337
00:23:38,342 --> 00:23:40,061
I was looking at Jupiter.

338
00:23:41,967 --> 00:23:43,342
I didn't do it on purpose.

339
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:46,373
It was just...

340
00:23:48,592 --> 00:23:51,626
It was just nice, you know,
to have someone to talk to.

341
00:23:53,134 --> 00:23:54,722
For once. For me.

342
00:23:57,634 --> 00:23:59,791
Sometimes I feel a bit alone.

343
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,391
Okay.

344
00:24:32,217 --> 00:24:35,725
What else can we write?
Numbers? Say a prime number.

345
00:24:35,925 --> 00:24:39,338
- Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly.
- 353.

346
00:24:40,675 --> 00:24:44,302
353!

347
00:24:44,592 --> 00:24:45,801
Whoa!

348
00:24:45,925 --> 00:24:47,300
Just in time.

349
00:24:47,592 --> 00:24:48,682
Perfect timing.

350
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,459
Fireworks night again, is it?

351
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,708
He's letting you hold his hand, isn't he?

352
00:24:53,842 --> 00:24:54,968
The sparkler helps.

353
00:24:55,758 --> 00:24:56,719
Come on, Nathan.

354
00:24:57,092 --> 00:24:58,561
It's time to change the fish.

355
00:24:59,258 --> 00:25:02,352
If you come now you can get
an extra scoop of ice cream.

356
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,341
Extra scoop of Ice cream.
And what do I get?

357
00:25:04,425 --> 00:25:05,800
- You don't get anything.
- Go ahead, go ahead.

358
00:25:05,925 --> 00:25:07,833
You're lucky I'm here, that's all.

359
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:09,934
- I'm lucky.
- Yeah, you get me.

360
00:25:21,716 --> 00:25:24,004
- I like a man in a shed.
- Ah...

361
00:25:25,133 --> 00:25:26,473
- Go and get me ice cream.
- But you're not getting...

362
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:28,097
I told you, you're not getting...

363
00:25:28,216 --> 00:25:29,466
Ice cream, Julie!

364
00:25:37,425 --> 00:25:38,420
Nathan?

365
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,510
Jesus.

366
00:25:42,716 --> 00:25:43,677
Nathan!

367
00:25:46,508 --> 00:25:47,468
Oh!

368
00:25:47,591 --> 00:25:48,801
Nathan, It's okay.

369
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:51,804
Nathan, I'm not angry.

370
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,086
Nathan!

371
00:25:53,216 --> 00:25:55,539
Michael? Michael?

372
00:26:14,424 --> 00:26:15,385
Everything all right?
Yeah.

373
00:26:15,508 --> 00:26:17,641
I'm quite looking forward to this
in a weird sort of way.

374
00:26:17,758 --> 00:26:18,718
Yeah, I know.

375
00:26:19,216 --> 00:26:20,875
Little trip down memory lane.

376
00:26:21,924 --> 00:26:23,679
- Okay. We all ready?
- Hang on.

377
00:26:25,091 --> 00:26:26,051
This is for you.

378
00:26:30,258 --> 00:26:31,218
Nathan...

379
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:33,218
What do you say?

380
00:26:35,258 --> 00:26:36,668
- Thank you.
- Well, I used to use them,

381
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,044
so they're probably cursed.

382
00:26:38,174 --> 00:26:40,467
But, you know, it might remind
you of home or something.

383
00:26:40,549 --> 00:26:41,924
Very lovely of you.
Right then.

384
00:26:42,049 --> 00:26:44,549
- Shall we get this show on the road?
- Yep. Let's go.

385
00:26:44,841 --> 00:26:45,801
Nathan?

386
00:26:46,924 --> 00:26:48,833
Can you get in the back with me?

387
00:26:48,966 --> 00:26:52,344
Nathan, I think Mr. Humphreys will be
more comfortable in the front.

388
00:26:53,549 --> 00:26:54,711
It's okay, darling.

389
00:26:54,841 --> 00:26:56,560
Darling, darling, it's okay.

390
00:26:57,341 --> 00:26:58,502
I'll drive carefully.

391
00:27:00,049 --> 00:27:01,010
No, It's all right.

392
00:27:01,966 --> 00:27:04,372
I'm actually surprisingly bendy.

393
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:24,758
Christ.

394
00:27:25,591 --> 00:27:27,215
It's Tricky Dicky. Look out.

395
00:27:29,424 --> 00:27:30,764
All right, Richard?

396
00:27:31,174 --> 00:27:32,134
Oh!

397
00:27:33,424 --> 00:27:35,048
Martin Humphreys. '95.

398
00:27:35,174 --> 00:27:37,580
Humphreys! Yeah, hell's teeth. Yes.

399
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:40,122
Yes. The last I heard, you were, um...

400
00:27:41,382 --> 00:27:42,887
- Teaching, was it?
- Yes.

401
00:27:43,591 --> 00:27:45,878
Yeah. At what university? I can't...

402
00:27:46,007 --> 00:27:48,544
- It's a secondary school.
- Ah, yeah.

403
00:27:48,716 --> 00:27:50,221
Wasted opportunity, this one.

404
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:52,674
So what are you doing here?
You flying off to Ibiza?

405
00:27:52,924 --> 00:27:57,096
Fleeing the world of reason and rationality
for some hallucinogenic escape?

406
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:59,432
No, I'm dropping this one off, actually.

407
00:28:00,632 --> 00:28:01,593
Ah!

408
00:28:01,924 --> 00:28:03,713
Nathan Ellis, I presume. Yes.

409
00:28:04,132 --> 00:28:05,602
The dragon. Ah!

410
00:28:05,965 --> 00:28:07,246
And where have you been lying dormant, eh?

411
00:28:07,382 --> 00:28:09,788
It's not often we have a mind like yours
spring up off the radar.

412
00:28:09,924 --> 00:28:10,884
He's mine.

413
00:28:11,465 --> 00:28:13,753
I mean, I'm his...
Um, I've been teaching him.

414
00:28:13,882 --> 00:28:17,011
Ah. The plot thickens.

415
00:28:17,215 --> 00:28:19,349
Well, we'll get you
signed in, shall we, eh?

416
00:28:19,465 --> 00:28:21,433
Just a quick goodbye and then avanti.

417
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:24,300
Oh, well, Nathan, darling.

418
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,872
Um...

419
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,932
You got your phone on you? Yeah?

420
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:30,134
Yeah.

421
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,163
Make sure you ring me
as soon as you land, yeah?

422
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:39,212
- All right. Bye, then.
- Bye.

423
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,551
Sorry.

424
00:28:56,048 --> 00:28:57,767
Time to meet your peers, Nathan.

425
00:29:01,173 --> 00:29:02,643
Mingle. Mingle.

426
00:29:03,215 --> 00:29:05,621
Um, watch your step,
there's a chess game going on.

427
00:29:11,923 --> 00:29:13,796
Hey. How do you do?

428
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,835
How do I do what?

429
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:19,795
I mean, what's your name?

430
00:29:21,215 --> 00:29:22,874
- Nathan.
- I'm Isaac.

431
00:29:23,798 --> 00:29:26,465
I'm guessing this is your first maths camp?
You'll be fine.

432
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,345
Best thing is just to dive in.

433
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:30,749
Come. Sit down.

434
00:29:31,548 --> 00:29:32,923
I mean, can you believe the Chinese team?

435
00:29:33,048 --> 00:29:35,300
They won 6 golds again last year.

436
00:29:35,423 --> 00:29:39,809
Yes, although upon recent evidential proof
I'd expect this to possibly change,

437
00:29:39,923 --> 00:29:43,183
if I'm allowed to split infinitives,
to possibly change.

438
00:29:43,298 --> 00:29:45,455
Which I believe I technically am now.

439
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:48,256
Of course, one of the most famous
infinitive splits of all time

440
00:29:48,381 --> 00:29:52,139
came in the introductory lines
of Star Trek, "to boldly go," and...

441
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,971
I think if the writers of a popular
American television series

442
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:58,100
can get away with it for 40 years,
then, really, any of us can.

443
00:29:58,215 --> 00:30:00,004
Don't worry, he's always like this.

444
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:02,170
Everyone, this is Nathan.

445
00:30:02,465 --> 00:30:04,302
- Hi, Nathan.
- Hello, Nathan.

446
00:30:04,423 --> 00:30:05,383
Hi, I'm Pav.

447
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,336
Paf?

448
00:30:08,465 --> 00:30:10,089
P-A-V, Pav.

449
00:30:10,756 --> 00:30:12,629
Pav is from India. Pav.

450
00:30:13,006 --> 00:30:14,287
Actually I'm from Chipping Norton.

451
00:30:14,423 --> 00:30:17,801
Yes, but of course I meant your origins,
not your birthplace,

452
00:30:17,923 --> 00:30:19,891
before we open that little Pandora's box.

453
00:30:20,006 --> 00:30:21,666
Oh, dear!

454
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:27,385
Seat belts on, please.
Seat belts on.

455
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:32,182
Right, don't sit at the front next
to the driver, that's my seat.

456
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:35,052
Right, away you go, driver.

457
00:30:35,965 --> 00:30:41,642
Now, you are 16 of the cleverest
young brains in this country.

458
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:46,085
Now, outside you might be
considered nerds or geeks

459
00:30:46,214 --> 00:30:48,751
or whatever the insult du jour might be.

460
00:30:49,006 --> 00:30:51,851
But here, you are among kindred spirits.

461
00:30:53,256 --> 00:30:55,579
Now, assuming you're capable
of basic arithmetic,

462
00:30:55,589 --> 00:30:59,726
you'll know that there are 6 places
available yet more than 6 of you.

463
00:31:00,423 --> 00:31:03,682
Which means that this, to a large extent,
is about whittling you down.

464
00:31:04,423 --> 00:31:08,085
Now, we will be training with 4 other
national teams in Taiwan.

465
00:31:08,464 --> 00:31:10,382
And after some
delicate diplomatic negotiation,

466
00:31:10,506 --> 00:31:13,706
I can confirm that the Chinese
will be one of them.

467
00:31:14,589 --> 00:31:16,628
Now we should, of course, be cordial

468
00:31:16,756 --> 00:31:20,549
as it falls to us to host
the competition this year, in Cambridge.

469
00:31:20,673 --> 00:31:22,711
But that doesn't mean we can't be ruthless.

470
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:27,588
Now, I want you up there
with the Chinese, top of the table.

471
00:31:28,714 --> 00:31:32,578
And I will consider it an abhorrent
failure to include a candidate

472
00:31:32,589 --> 00:31:34,462
who does not win a medal.

473
00:31:35,839 --> 00:31:40,130
Be under no illusion.
This is all about winning.

474
00:31:41,589 --> 00:31:43,592
Although that doesn't mean it can't be fun.

475
00:31:46,089 --> 00:31:50,226
55, 89, 144,

476
00:31:50,589 --> 00:31:53,540
233, 377,

477
00:31:53,881 --> 00:31:54,841
610.

478
00:31:54,964 --> 00:32:00,476
987, 1,597, 2,584.

479
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:04,712
I like the Fibonacci sequence, too.

480
00:32:05,964 --> 00:32:07,718
Invaluable for music compositions.

481
00:32:09,006 --> 00:32:10,096
So you're new.

482
00:32:10,672 --> 00:32:11,704
Fresh meat.

483
00:32:12,506 --> 00:32:13,537
How's that going?

484
00:32:17,672 --> 00:32:19,830
Okay, so you're the shy type.

485
00:32:22,256 --> 00:32:23,673
Makes a nice change, to be honest.

486
00:32:24,797 --> 00:32:28,006
Most of these weirdos just wanna show off
about how much maths junk they know.

487
00:32:29,589 --> 00:32:30,549
What?

488
00:32:31,464 --> 00:32:32,424
Nothing.

489
00:32:32,964 --> 00:32:34,932
It's just I'm usually the weird one.

490
00:32:37,672 --> 00:32:39,675
They do all seem good at maths, though.

491
00:32:40,589 --> 00:32:41,715
Yeah.

492
00:32:42,547 --> 00:32:46,553
Here you are neither weird
nor the best mathematician, I'm afraid.

493
00:32:47,589 --> 00:32:49,426
You are painstakingly average.

494
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,011
Post-Olympiad of course,
I'll need to branch out into

495
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:32,006
modem theoretical physics if I'm going
to describe a unified field theory

496
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:34,169
for the 4 fundamental forces of nature.

497
00:33:34,547 --> 00:33:37,048
Are you one of the fundamental
forces of nature, Luke?

498
00:33:37,922 --> 00:33:38,882
No.

499
00:33:39,172 --> 00:33:41,246
But you are terribly gifted, aren't you?

500
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:44,889
Yes. Gifted but not arrogant, Isaac.

501
00:34:10,838 --> 00:34:14,122
Here we are. Maths camp, Taipei.

502
00:34:14,588 --> 00:34:16,911
Your home for the next 2 weeks.

503
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,634
Right, everybody out.

504
00:34:21,255 --> 00:34:22,760
Don't forget your umbrellas.

505
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,468
There's a typhoon coming.

506
00:34:27,505 --> 00:34:29,342
- Hello.
- Hello. Welcome to Taiwan.

507
00:34:29,463 --> 00:34:31,131
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello. I'm Richard.

508
00:34:31,255 --> 00:34:32,215
My name is Jason.

509
00:34:32,338 --> 00:34:34,057
Nice to meet you, Jaigen.

510
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:35,641
- Jason. Yeah.
- Jason. I'm sorry.

511
00:34:35,755 --> 00:34:36,796
Jason. It was the accent.

512
00:34:36,838 --> 00:34:37,838
Hello. Nice to meet you.

513
00:34:37,921 --> 00:34:40,174
Right, come on, get your bags. Chop-chop.

514
00:34:41,296 --> 00:34:43,015
Can someone help the man, please?

515
00:34:43,755 --> 00:34:45,722
It's not the days of the Empire.
Thank you.

516
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:50,507
Oh!

517
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,538
Here comes the typhoon!

518
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:55,600
Batten down the hatches.

519
00:34:59,546 --> 00:35:00,791
Taiwanese.

520
00:35:00,921 --> 00:35:02,581
Currently below us in the rankings,

521
00:35:02,713 --> 00:35:05,000
but they're our hosts,
so we should be gracious.

522
00:35:07,171 --> 00:35:08,677
Here's the real competition.

523
00:35:10,588 --> 00:35:11,584
The Chinese.

524
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,539
Guys, check out the board.

525
00:35:14,671 --> 00:35:16,805
Is she messing around
with the Goldbach Conjecture?

526
00:35:17,213 --> 00:35:18,374
Maybe it's what they do for fun.

527
00:35:18,505 --> 00:35:21,456
Mmm, I love cracking unprovable theorems
in my free time.

528
00:35:21,588 --> 00:35:23,579
No one has proven that it's unprovable.

529
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:26,302
Right, come on. They won't bite.

530
00:35:28,421 --> 00:35:30,175
Ah! The enemy!

531
00:35:30,463 --> 00:35:32,620
Surrender or die!

532
00:35:33,296 --> 00:35:34,636
Deng Laoshi.

533
00:35:34,754 --> 00:35:36,165
Dear Richard, welcome.

534
00:35:36,296 --> 00:35:37,956
- Such an honour to have you here.
- Thank you.

535
00:35:38,088 --> 00:35:40,162
- Ni hao.
- Ni hao.

536
00:35:41,046 --> 00:35:42,587
Students, hello.

537
00:35:44,213 --> 00:35:46,287
I hope you are ready for some mathematics.

538
00:35:58,296 --> 00:36:01,141
Now, pay attention, Team UK.

539
00:36:01,879 --> 00:36:04,914
Deng Laoshi and I have decided to pair
you up with a Chinese buddy

540
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:07,756
and you should make the most
of this opportunity,

541
00:36:07,879 --> 00:36:11,328
or, more to the point, you should
spy on your Chinese counterpart

542
00:36:11,463 --> 00:36:13,252
and bring their trade secrets to Blighty.

543
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:15,338
Very funny, Richard.

544
00:36:16,504 --> 00:36:18,093
Uh, Luke Shelton.

545
00:36:19,671 --> 00:36:20,631
Zhang Zhi.

546
00:36:25,338 --> 00:36:26,997
Hello. My name is Zhang Zhi.

547
00:36:27,588 --> 00:36:28,548
Luke.

548
00:36:31,587 --> 00:36:32,998
Nathan Ellis.

549
00:36:33,754 --> 00:36:34,715
Zhang Mei.

550
00:36:47,129 --> 00:36:49,974
Nice to meet you. My name is Zhang Mei.

551
00:36:57,837 --> 00:36:59,378
Pavinder Kamdar.

552
00:37:11,087 --> 00:37:12,711
This is Shao Tong.

553
00:37:13,546 --> 00:37:15,264
- Nice to meet you.
- Ni hao.

554
00:37:16,379 --> 00:37:18,417
And you know my uncle.

555
00:37:18,796 --> 00:37:22,339
Nathan. The lucky one
learning from my niece, huh?

556
00:37:25,254 --> 00:37:27,541
We have high expectations for her.

557
00:37:28,504 --> 00:37:30,092
And for you, of course.

558
00:37:30,212 --> 00:37:32,429
High expectations all round, I say.

559
00:37:34,837 --> 00:37:35,798
Zhang Mei.

560
00:37:36,795 --> 00:37:37,756
Oh.

561
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:43,750
Yes, of course, though it may be
the world's fastest developing nation

562
00:37:43,879 --> 00:37:47,707
some of the cuisine doesn't seem
to have advanced quite so quickly.

563
00:37:49,087 --> 00:37:50,711
Careful. Careful.
Oh, look at this.

564
00:37:50,837 --> 00:37:54,535
- Thank you. Uh, zhi Zhia... Xie xie.
- Xie xie.

565
00:37:54,879 --> 00:37:57,913
You put this in there?
You put the raw food in this.

566
00:37:58,045 --> 00:37:59,463
- In the peanut sauce?
- Oh...

567
00:37:59,504 --> 00:38:01,471
- No.
- Okay, okay, I'll do that.

568
00:38:04,129 --> 00:38:07,827
You don't use them... Like that.

569
00:38:08,504 --> 00:38:11,704
Hold it like this and
pinch it like a lobster.

570
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,381
Yeah.

571
00:38:14,295 --> 00:38:18,502
So, Nathan, what was your score
on the mock IMO paper?

572
00:38:19,629 --> 00:38:22,580
Zhang Mei got the full 7 marks
on questions 1 to 3.

573
00:38:22,712 --> 00:38:25,627
Though her combinatorics
is her weakest area.

574
00:38:27,378 --> 00:38:29,536
I'm really not... Not that good.

575
00:38:31,253 --> 00:38:33,221
No, but you soon will be.

576
00:39:10,878 --> 00:39:13,166
Nathan, are you okay?

577
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:35,621
Almost everyone on the camp speaks English.

578
00:39:36,003 --> 00:39:37,757
It is expected of us.

579
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:40,717
You speak it very well.

580
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:42,431
Thank you.

581
00:39:42,836 --> 00:39:44,117
So do you.

582
00:39:44,503 --> 00:39:46,257
Chinese, I mean.

583
00:39:47,003 --> 00:39:50,132
You don't say a lot in English at all.

584
00:40:10,753 --> 00:40:13,135
This room seems reasonably symmetrical.

585
00:40:13,503 --> 00:40:15,292
Apart from the window.

586
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,880
I don't know about you,

587
00:40:18,003 --> 00:40:21,097
but I don't appreciate
this forced proximity to each other.

588
00:40:24,919 --> 00:40:26,638
I'll take this side.

589
00:40:29,336 --> 00:40:30,676
I'm going to the bathroom.

590
00:41:10,711 --> 00:41:13,496
Oh, you dirty little bastard.

591
00:41:14,586 --> 00:41:15,546
Go on, then.

592
00:41:16,378 --> 00:41:20,005
Oh, my God, that is absolutely disgusting.

593
00:41:20,877 --> 00:41:23,094
Boom! Wanker.

594
00:41:26,586 --> 00:41:27,546
Yeah?

595
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:30,459
- Yes. Who's this?
- It's...

596
00:41:31,586 --> 00:41:33,340
Nathan? Is that you?

597
00:41:34,502 --> 00:41:36,336
How are you doing? How's
it going out there?

598
00:41:36,586 --> 00:41:40,035
Everything's different
and everyone's cleverer than me.

599
00:41:42,252 --> 00:41:44,220
Look, Nathan, it's your
first night away and...

600
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:48,460
And first nights away
are always really, really shit.

601
00:41:50,252 --> 00:41:51,841
I mean, it's only a fortnight, innit?

602
00:41:52,211 --> 00:41:53,929
That's 14 days. And what's 14?

603
00:41:56,502 --> 00:42:00,081
- A positive integer.
- Positive integer.

604
00:42:00,211 --> 00:42:01,680
So think positively.

605
00:42:02,252 --> 00:42:03,757
Which is the square root of?

606
00:42:04,586 --> 00:42:06,126
196.

607
00:42:06,419 --> 00:42:08,706
Whose prime factorisation is?

608
00:42:09,586 --> 00:42:11,209
Two squared by seven squared.

609
00:42:12,461 --> 00:42:13,421
See?

610
00:42:38,335 --> 00:42:42,875
<i> 1, 2, buckle my shoe

611
00:42:43,585 --> 00:42:45,209
<i> 3, 4.

612
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,999
<i> Knock on my door.

613
00:42:48,627 --> 00:42:53,510
<i> 5, 6, pick up your sticks

614
00:42:53,585 --> 00:42:58,220
<i> 7, 8, lay them straight

615
00:42:59,085 --> 00:43:00,958
<i> 1, 2.

616
00:43:01,794 --> 00:43:03,631
<i> Buckle my shoe

617
00:43:04,294 --> 00:43:06,012
<i> 3, 4... <i>

618
00:43:13,377 --> 00:43:14,538
Strong squad this year?

619
00:43:15,668 --> 00:43:17,921
Testing my team for weaknesses, Richard?

620
00:43:18,543 --> 00:43:20,950
You should relax more,
not take it so seriously.

621
00:43:22,085 --> 00:43:24,919
It's all right for you, you got
the best in the world to choose from.

622
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:28,678
But having your niece on the team, Deng?

623
00:43:29,877 --> 00:43:31,382
I mean, really?

624
00:43:33,627 --> 00:43:34,717
You'll see.

625
00:43:38,502 --> 00:43:39,711
Luke, I don't care.

626
00:43:39,835 --> 00:43:42,964
Civilizations have used 10, not 12,
digits to count for millennia.

627
00:43:43,085 --> 00:43:46,593
Yes, for purely primitive reasons, and the
fact that we have 10 digits on our hands.

628
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:49,211
My argument is that if we use base 12

629
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:52,215
it is an infinitely superior system,
and more logical.

630
00:43:52,335 --> 00:43:54,717
It takes 12 months for the Earth
to orbit the sun,

631
00:43:54,835 --> 00:43:57,241
there are 12 hours a night
and 12 hours a day,

632
00:43:57,377 --> 00:43:59,835
and each of those hours there
are 12 5-minute increments.

633
00:43:59,877 --> 00:44:01,287
And what do you think, Nathan?

634
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:03,784
You a member of the dozenalist society?

635
00:44:04,335 --> 00:44:05,425
Uh, I don't know.

636
00:44:06,085 --> 00:44:07,045
Sorry.

637
00:44:07,543 --> 00:44:11,455
People disagreeing with my opinion
is one thing, but no opinion?

638
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:13,990
You might as well not be here.

639
00:44:17,251 --> 00:44:18,283
The vertices of a regular 72-gon.

640
00:44:18,293 --> 00:44:19,538
The vertices of a regular 72-gon

641
00:44:19,668 --> 00:44:23,082
are each coloured red,
green or blue in equal amounts.

642
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:27,714
Show that we can always choose 4 red,
4 green or 4 blue vertices

643
00:44:27,835 --> 00:44:31,746
such that each monochromatic set
form a congruent quadrilateral.

644
00:44:31,876 --> 00:44:35,574
Yes, so, of course, the whole question can
be trivialised by Ramsey Theory.

645
00:44:35,585 --> 00:44:37,793
No, sorry, Luke.
There were other hands up before you.

646
00:44:38,126 --> 00:44:39,750
Well, I've already answered it now.

647
00:44:39,876 --> 00:44:41,595
Really? You think so?

648
00:44:42,918 --> 00:44:45,135
Is anyone here convinced by Luke's answer?

649
00:44:45,376 --> 00:44:47,379
"It's interesting you ask
"is anyone convinced?"

650
00:44:47,501 --> 00:44:49,339
rather than "is anyone not convinced?"

651
00:44:49,585 --> 00:44:51,552
- I'm not convinced.
- I'm not convinced.

652
00:44:52,585 --> 00:44:55,299
Nathan, would you join in, please?

653
00:44:55,418 --> 00:44:56,579
This isn't a holiday.

654
00:44:57,626 --> 00:44:59,167
Do you have a proof to share?

655
00:45:02,626 --> 00:45:03,836
That's a disappointment.

656
00:45:05,168 --> 00:45:06,199
Ben?

657
00:45:07,418 --> 00:45:10,582
Muirhead's inequality
and Schur's inequality?

658
00:45:13,334 --> 00:45:16,534
It's interesting stuff, Nathan,
but you do over-complicate everything.

659
00:45:17,793 --> 00:45:20,329
Things can be much simpler
than they initially appear.

660
00:45:20,459 --> 00:45:22,297
Did Mr. Humphreys not tell you that?

661
00:45:23,251 --> 00:45:25,876
Mind you, he never did quite live up
to his potential, that one.

662
00:45:26,334 --> 00:45:28,243
It's because his illness was getting worse.

663
00:45:29,084 --> 00:45:30,045
His Illness?

664
00:45:31,251 --> 00:45:32,970
Is he still using that excuse?

665
00:45:34,293 --> 00:45:36,580
Stephen Hawking has done
all right on far worse.

666
00:45:37,168 --> 00:45:40,427
No, I'm afraid it wasn't
Mr. Humphreys' body that failed him,

667
00:45:40,543 --> 00:45:42,297
it was his character.

668
00:45:43,334 --> 00:45:44,875
He just couldn't stay with it.

669
00:46:21,126 --> 00:46:23,757
<i> If you must wait

670
00:46:25,751 --> 00:46:30,207
<i> Wait for them here in my arms as I shake

671
00:46:37,251 --> 00:46:39,787
<i> If you must weep...

672
00:46:40,626 --> 00:46:42,949
- Is that strong enough for you?
- That's fine.

673
00:46:44,001 --> 00:46:46,253
- No sugar?
- No sugar, sweet enough for me.

674
00:46:46,376 --> 00:46:48,379
- How are you doing?
- Never better.

675
00:46:53,209 --> 00:46:56,717
<i> you must mourn, my love</i>

676
00:46:57,417 --> 00:47:02,087
<i> Mourn with the moon
and the stars up above

677
00:47:06,792 --> 00:47:09,115
<i> you must mourn</i>

678
00:47:11,375 --> 00:47:14,007
<i> Don't do it alone <i>

679
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:19,012
So, as well as your cycle of amitriptyline,

680
00:47:19,375 --> 00:47:24,543
you were prescribed glucocorticosteroids
for your latest relapse.

681
00:47:24,917 --> 00:47:26,623
You can't have got through
all of those already.

682
00:47:26,625 --> 00:47:27,625
I wouldn't have thought.

683
00:47:27,709 --> 00:47:29,249
Someone broke Into my car.

684
00:47:29,375 --> 00:47:30,336
Unfortunate.

685
00:47:31,084 --> 00:47:33,407
- Mention it to the police?
- No, there's no point, is there?

686
00:47:33,542 --> 00:47:36,576
Because they only stole
the pills and some CD's.

687
00:47:36,584 --> 00:47:39,049
Bee Gees' greatest hits.
Which I was gutted about

688
00:47:39,167 --> 00:47:41,739
because I bloody love
those squeaky little bastards.

689
00:47:41,875 --> 00:47:44,969
So to be clear, these are not
anti-depressants, Mr. Humphreys.

690
00:47:45,084 --> 00:47:46,960
I mean, that's good
because I'm not depressed.

691
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:49,030
You know, maybe you wanna
change your mind

692
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:51,549
about going to one of those groups
I mentioned?

693
00:47:53,375 --> 00:47:56,251
What, sit in a circle and listen
to how crap everybody else's life is?

694
00:47:56,292 --> 00:48:00,499
- You know, sharing your issues might help.
- Sharing my issues?

695
00:48:01,167 --> 00:48:04,012
Like how I hate wobbling about like a twat,

696
00:48:04,292 --> 00:48:07,172
how I've started to lose control
of my bladder and it won't be on the floor

697
00:48:07,292 --> 00:48:09,698
before I lose control of my arse
and start to shit myself.

698
00:48:09,833 --> 00:48:11,801
So, be careful,
'cause I could go at any second.

699
00:48:11,917 --> 00:48:13,920
And then, to top it all off...

700
00:48:14,833 --> 00:48:16,078
My dick doesn't work.

701
00:48:19,417 --> 00:48:20,957
Is that the sort of thing
you think I should be sharing?

702
00:48:21,083 --> 00:48:22,044
Yeah.

703
00:48:23,083 --> 00:48:24,044
Perhaps.

704
00:48:24,458 --> 00:48:27,718
No, but what I really want, Martin,
is for you to

705
00:48:28,667 --> 00:48:29,627
not give up.

706
00:48:36,292 --> 00:48:38,828
I should probably take this
because it's my crack dealer.

707
00:48:41,833 --> 00:48:43,623
- Hello?
- Hello, Martin.

708
00:48:44,708 --> 00:48:47,114
It... It's Julie. Yes.

709
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:48,792
That's right. Julie Ellis.

710
00:48:53,958 --> 00:48:55,238
- Hi. Hi.
- Hiya.

711
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,754
- Thanks for coming round. It's...
- It's all right.

712
00:48:57,875 --> 00:48:59,594
- Yeah.
- You sure you're ready for this?

713
00:49:00,416 --> 00:49:01,957
Absolutely.

714
00:49:02,541 --> 00:49:05,386
Okay, then.
Let's begin at the beginning, shall we?

715
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:06,460
Mmm-hmm.

716
00:49:08,791 --> 00:49:10,925
It's all right. It's like anything.
It's scary at first.

717
00:49:11,041 --> 00:49:13,583
But then when you get your head
round it, you'll be all right.

718
00:49:13,750 --> 00:49:14,710
Uh...

719
00:49:16,583 --> 00:49:17,543
Has he, um...

720
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:21,166
Has he rung you again?

721
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:22,572
- Nathan? No.
- Yeah.

722
00:49:24,750 --> 00:49:26,717
Now, look, I'm sure he didn't mean
anything by it, calling me.

723
00:49:26,833 --> 00:49:28,552
It's just he doesn't think
sometimes, does he?

724
00:49:28,666 --> 00:49:31,926
Oh, well, no, he does think a lot.
Just mainly about maths.

725
00:49:33,166 --> 00:49:34,577
Which is fine, you know.

726
00:49:35,166 --> 00:49:38,166
He just thinks I'm a bit of an idiot
because I failed at maths at school.

727
00:49:38,458 --> 00:49:40,532
I mean, I got everything else,
it was just, you know...

728
00:49:40,666 --> 00:49:41,792
Mmm.

729
00:49:42,041 --> 00:49:44,921
It's why I wanna do this really,
you know, get into his head more.

730
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:49,616
- I'm not making sense. Shut up, Julie.
- No, you're making perfect sense.

731
00:49:49,625 --> 00:49:51,094
- Not really.
- No, you are.

732
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:55,036
I mean, the thing about maths,
as with any subject,

733
00:49:55,166 --> 00:49:58,745
I think if you have an inspirational
teacher, um, then you'll be away.

734
00:49:58,874 --> 00:50:00,119
Which is where I come in.

735
00:50:00,249 --> 00:50:02,253
Mr. Inspirational.

736
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:03,584
Okay, then.

737
00:50:04,583 --> 00:50:06,799
Let's start with something...

738
00:50:06,916 --> 00:50:09,049
- Yeah. Pythagoras. Yay.
- Okay.

739
00:50:09,166 --> 00:50:11,572
- Uh, can you say that word?
- Hypotenuse.

740
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:13,782
Bless you.

741
00:50:14,333 --> 00:50:16,250
You all right? You got a
little bit of a cold?

742
00:50:20,208 --> 00:50:23,218
<i> It's time to step up, mofo,
and see what you can do

743
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:28,631
<i> Keep your Pythag theorem to yourself
I raise you B minus C plus F equals 2 <i>

744
00:50:31,958 --> 00:50:34,459
- Who's next? Who's next?
- Your turn, Luke.

745
00:50:34,624 --> 00:50:35,869
Go, Luke.

746
00:50:35,999 --> 00:50:37,753
Go, Luke. Go, Luke.

747
00:50:37,874 --> 00:50:40,162
Thank you, but I really
don't see the point.

748
00:50:40,583 --> 00:50:43,582
Apart from succumbing
to testosterone-fuelled irrationality.

749
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,123
It's because it's funny, Luke.

750
00:50:45,249 --> 00:50:47,458
- Don't you have a sense of humour?
- Just ignore him.

751
00:50:47,624 --> 00:50:49,579
He's here to bring the mood down as always,
so don't let him.

752
00:50:49,583 --> 00:50:52,249
- I'm here to do maths.
- You're just a regular quadrilateral.

753
00:50:54,541 --> 00:50:57,041
- Okay, take it, Ben.
- </i> UK, make some noise!

754

- Um...

758
00:51:18,707 --> 00:51:20,047
No, It's all right.

759
00:51:22,624 --> 00:51:24,781
I was just practising my fingering.

760
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:27,626
Um...

761
00:51:30,791 --> 00:51:32,201
Go on, laugh.

762
00:51:34,207 --> 00:51:35,452
No? Okay.

763
00:51:36,499 --> 00:51:37,838
Um, do you play?

764
00:51:40,499 --> 00:51:41,625
- No.
- Come on.

765
00:51:46,166 --> 00:51:47,161
So...

766
00:51:47,707 --> 00:51:49,995
Beautiful sounds are
about frequency ratios.

767
00:51:51,290 --> 00:51:55,368
The simpler the ratio, like this C
and this C, a simple ratio of 1:2.

768
00:51:57,707 --> 00:51:58,987
Beautiful.

769
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:01,957
Complex harmonies, like this...

770
00:52:03,082 --> 00:52:04,173
Ugly.

771
00:52:22,665 --> 00:52:23,626
Do you want to try?

772
00:52:25,374 --> 00:52:26,464
Okay.

773
00:52:43,082 --> 00:52:44,622
Is that right?

774
00:52:45,790 --> 00:52:47,509
Yeah, it was, um...

775
00:52:48,623 --> 00:52:51,290
- So you've never played before?
- No.

776
00:52:54,373 --> 00:52:55,962
All music is maths, really.

777
00:52:57,415 --> 00:52:58,957
Come on, I'll teach you the next bit.

778
00:54:28,456 --> 00:54:30,294
Is this all right?
Oh, Christ, yeah.

779
00:54:30,415 --> 00:54:32,123
- Do you want me to pour it out?
- Please.

780
00:54:33,748 --> 00:54:35,751
It's nice to relax actually.
It's been a while.

781
00:54:35,873 --> 00:54:37,034
- There you go.
- Thank you.

782
00:54:37,331 --> 00:54:39,737
Well, it's good that you
find maths relaxing.

783
00:54:44,873 --> 00:54:46,710
Must have been very difficult for you,

784
00:54:48,164 --> 00:54:50,168
being just you and Nathan.

785
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:53,201
You know, without...

786
00:54:59,248 --> 00:55:00,279
- Michael.
- Michael.

787
00:55:01,414 --> 00:55:03,204
- Sorry. Dickhead.
- No.

788
00:55:03,331 --> 00:55:05,299
- Me, not... Not Michael.
- I know.

789
00:55:09,331 --> 00:55:11,370
Well, I mean, but you're...

790
00:55:12,414 --> 00:55:14,797
You're the same. It must be the...

791
00:55:17,289 --> 00:55:19,541
I mean, you're not with anyone.

792
00:55:20,414 --> 00:55:22,323
- No. No.
- Are you? No.

793
00:55:23,456 --> 00:55:26,170
My passion's my work, you see.

794
00:55:28,039 --> 00:55:29,829
Sorry.

795
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:32,450
- You all right?
- Yeah.

796
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:38,045
Sometimes I wonder if Nathan
will ever find anyone, you know?

797
00:55:38,581 --> 00:55:40,240
Nathan's nothing like me.

798
00:55:41,872 --> 00:55:44,409
If you're worried that Nathan's
gonna end up like... You shouldn't.

799
00:55:44,539 --> 00:55:46,791
- I wasn't. It would be a good thing.
- You shouldn't.

800
00:55:51,497 --> 00:55:53,501
- I might just pop off to the toilet.
- Okay.

801
00:56:15,456 --> 00:56:17,044
Uh, I got crisps.

802
00:56:28,956 --> 00:56:29,951
<i>Oh...</i>

803
00:56:30,622 --> 00:56:32,412
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

804
00:56:36,997 --> 00:56:38,870
- Sorry, are you a bit stiff?
- No, what?

805
00:56:38,997 --> 00:56:40,586
I mean, your back.

806
00:56:54,164 --> 00:56:56,617
Oh...

807
00:56:56,622 --> 00:56:58,910
- Shit. I'm so sorry. Did I hurt you?
- It's okay. Are you all right?

808
00:56:59,039 --> 00:57:00,757
No. It's okay.

809
00:57:01,497 --> 00:57:03,654
- You all right?
- Sorry. Sorry about that.

810
00:57:03,789 --> 00:57:05,413
- It's okay.
- I, um...

811
00:57:05,872 --> 00:57:07,461
I just want to say that, um...

812
00:57:08,164 --> 00:57:09,622
- You don't...
- For me... No, I do.

813
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:15,069
In this sort of situation there's only
so far that I am able to, um, go.

814
00:57:16,247 --> 00:57:18,120
And I don't want to make you disappointed.

815
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:24,840
You... You couldn't. I wouldn't... Sorry.

816
00:57:27,789 --> 00:57:29,507
Yeah, I understand.

817
00:57:30,622 --> 00:57:32,612
Do you mind if we get up?
I think I'm sat on a set square.

818
00:58:21,205 --> 00:58:25,661
I think it's funny that your favourite
English food is Chinese.

819
00:58:27,788 --> 00:58:30,633
Do you always like
to have everything the same?

820
00:58:30,747 --> 00:58:33,911
Because I change
my favourite things all the time.

821
00:58:35,413 --> 00:58:37,546
I don't usually like change.

822
00:58:39,996 --> 00:58:41,786
- I like it here, though.
- Do you?

823
00:58:41,913 --> 00:58:44,544
I mean, the Chinese approach to maths.

824
00:58:44,788 --> 00:58:45,819
Yes?

825
00:58:47,455 --> 00:58:48,545
Look.

826
00:58:49,788 --> 00:58:54,363
This is called The 9
Chapters of Mathematical Art.

827
00:58:54,996 --> 00:58:58,007
This took more than 1,000 years to write.

828
00:58:59,663 --> 00:59:03,918
In China, mathematics is more than numbers.

829
00:59:04,496 --> 00:59:06,903
Um, It is like art.

830
00:59:11,913 --> 00:59:13,039
Here.

831
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:23,962
There are... There are
8 prawn balls. I...

832
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:27,120
It needs to be a prime.

833
00:59:39,454 --> 00:59:44,693
So... 20 random cards
are placed in a row all face-down.

834
00:59:45,996 --> 00:59:50,322
A move consists of turning
a face-down card face-up

835
00:59:51,579 --> 00:59:54,863
and turning over the card
immediately to the right.

836
00:59:56,288 --> 00:59:59,571
Show that no matter
what the choice of cards to turn

837
01:00:00,371 --> 01:00:03,251
this sequence of moves must terminate.

838
01:00:05,371 --> 01:00:08,571
Nathan, hiding in the back won't help you.

839
01:00:09,121 --> 01:00:10,704
Would you like to come up and show us?

840
01:00:18,413 --> 01:00:19,918
Go on, Nathan.

841
01:00:54,871 --> 01:01:00,548
Okay, so we need to... We need to look
at the cards not as cards, but as, uh...

842
01:01:00,912 --> 01:01:02,287
As numbers.

843
01:01:03,662 --> 01:01:07,325
We can call face-down cards...

844
01:01:10,496 --> 01:01:11,586
One.

845
01:01:12,037 --> 01:01:14,917
Face-up cards... Zero.

846
01:01:16,329 --> 01:01:20,406
And initially it would be a sequence
of ones as the cards are all face down.

847
01:01:20,537 --> 01:01:25,954
But after a while it would look
something like that.

848
01:01:27,704 --> 01:01:30,549
And, as we can see, that
is a binary number.

849
01:01:31,954 --> 01:01:35,533
And a move that consists of turning
a face-down card face up

850
01:01:35,662 --> 01:01:38,862
and the card immediately to the right of it

851
01:01:40,162 --> 01:01:43,741
could be that a one followed by a one,

852
01:01:44,870 --> 01:01:47,585
will turn into a zero followed by a zero.

853
01:01:51,204 --> 01:01:54,582
That would be like that.
Or it could be a one followed by a zero

854
01:01:54,787 --> 01:01:58,366
turning into a zero followed by a one.

855
01:02:00,579 --> 01:02:05,817
In either case, we can see that the
number in binary is strictly decreasing.

856
01:02:08,704 --> 01:02:09,699
And that means?

857
01:02:11,745 --> 01:02:14,211
Which means that the sequence
must terminate.

858
01:02:15,204 --> 01:02:16,199
Because?

859
01:02:16,329 --> 01:02:18,735
Because you can't keep taking away
from a positive integer

860
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:22,414
- without it turning negative.
- No, you can't.

861
01:02:23,287 --> 01:02:25,574
You definitely can't. Good work;.

862
01:02:25,578 --> 01:02:27,451
Everyone. Good work.

863
01:04:02,453 --> 01:04:05,653
Uh, hello. My name's
Martin Humphreys and I'm an alcoholic.

864
01:04:06,495 --> 01:04:08,569
No, not really. Well, a little bit.

865
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:11,334
Um, I've got MS, that's why I'm here.
I got that group tomorrow.

866
01:04:11,453 --> 01:04:13,242
Uh...

867
01:04:13,370 --> 01:04:17,696
No, seriously, thank you for
everybody who's, uh, shared and stuff.

868
01:04:18,369 --> 01:04:22,376
Because there's definitely things
that I can identify with

869
01:04:22,703 --> 01:04:24,079
and that I definitely recognise;.

870
01:04:25,161 --> 01:04:26,252
Uh...

871
01:04:28,411 --> 01:04:32,453
So, there's this person I like, but I know

872
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:35,373
how bad I'm gonna get

873
01:04:36,619 --> 01:04:40,412
and it's very difficult to imagine
any sort of a rosy future

874
01:04:42,203 --> 01:04:46,872
or anyone wanting to be
a part of that future with me.

875
01:05:01,161 --> 01:05:03,448
Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Um...

876
01:05:07,161 --> 01:05:08,571
Because you...

877
01:05:13,036 --> 01:05:14,755
This is ridiculous.

878
01:05:19,161 --> 01:05:22,537
Because in a few years' time I might not...
I might not even be able to hold hands

879
01:05:24,077 --> 01:05:25,547
or have a little cuddle.

880
01:05:28,286 --> 01:05:29,412
And...

881
01:05:34,577 --> 01:05:36,865
That really, really scares me.

882
01:05:50,827 --> 01:05:55,153
We should ask the others to suggest
a variety of trigonometric identities

883
01:05:55,286 --> 01:05:59,197
to simplify the expressions,
which could include, say, coversine

884
01:05:59,327 --> 01:06:04,400
or possibly covercosine or versine
or excosecant and so on.

885
01:06:04,536 --> 01:06:06,609
Luke, we're trying to think of
fun questions for each other,

886
01:06:06,619 --> 01:06:09,155
we're not trying to prove how many
trigonometric identities we know.

887
01:06:09,286 --> 01:06:13,742
Well, then I really don't see the point.
We are competing with each other.

888
01:06:14,910 --> 01:06:17,613
You can pretend you're everyone's
best friend all you like, Isaac,

889
01:06:17,619 --> 01:06:18,828
but I'm here to get on the team.

890
01:06:18,952 --> 01:06:21,369
Sorry, when have I ever tried
to be your best friend, Luke?

891
01:06:25,494 --> 01:06:27,959
Nathan, this is a democracy,
yours is the casting vote.

892
01:06:28,077 --> 01:06:31,905
Yes. Democracy in the true Chinese
sense of the word. Forget it.

893
01:06:32,035 --> 01:06:34,244
- We'll just do your question...
- Are you gonna sulk?

894
01:06:34,869 --> 01:06:36,742
Boo-hoo-hoo, poor Luke.

895
01:06:46,494 --> 01:06:47,584
Sorry.

896
01:06:48,535 --> 01:06:51,546
- I've come across people like him before.
- Definitely autistic.

897
01:06:51,619 --> 01:06:54,370
He seems to have picked up all the
bad traits and none of the good.

898
01:06:54,785 --> 01:06:56,919
- What bad traits?
- Obsessive.

899
01:06:57,535 --> 01:07:00,321
- Socially incompetent.
- That sort of thing.

900
01:07:05,452 --> 01:07:07,171
It's about adaptability, Nathan.

901
01:07:09,494 --> 01:07:13,156
Sometimes we have to change our shape
so that we fit in.

902
01:07:17,618 --> 01:07:18,614
That was you pushing the cage.

903
01:07:18,743 --> 01:07:23,069
I did not!
Yes, you did! Polly!

904
01:07:24,535 --> 01:07:26,325
Polly Parrot, wake up!

905
01:07:27,535 --> 01:07:28,661
Polly!

906
01:07:29,952 --> 01:07:31,611
Now that's what I call a dead parrot.

907
01:07:35,702 --> 01:07:39,400
I love this. It's stinky tofu.

908
01:07:39,827 --> 01:07:41,415
Stinky?

909
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:45,732
Oh, that's horrible.

910
01:07:46,202 --> 01:07:49,236
It stinks but it tastes
really, really good.

911
01:07:50,410 --> 01:07:51,571
Oh, look.

912
01:07:51,702 --> 01:07:55,779
I used to play this when I was small,
in my hometown, as a child.

913
01:07:59,577 --> 01:08:00,537
A sweet.

914
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,696
- It's sticky.
- It's stuck in my teeth.

915
01:08:03,952 --> 01:08:06,583
You have a funny face.

916
01:08:08,993 --> 01:08:11,244
You don't like it? I'll eat it.
And you can have this'.

917
01:08:15,993 --> 01:08:18,530
We should, uh... We should probably go.

918
01:08:19,201 --> 01:08:20,197
Aren't you...

919
01:08:20,326 --> 01:08:21,796
Aren't you worried about the exam?

920
01:08:22,576 --> 01:08:26,583
Well, it is good to have a break.
Clear your mind.

921
01:08:28,035 --> 01:08:33,024
Don't worry. We will both get into
the Olympiad in Cambridge. The IMO.

922
01:08:33,160 --> 01:08:37,332
And I will meet your family
when I come and stay with you.

923
01:08:37,451 --> 01:08:39,205
My cultural exchange.

924
01:08:40,701 --> 01:08:41,697
Ah!

925
01:08:42,743 --> 01:08:44,153
Look at this.

926
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:52,040
You're a bit like a turtle, aren't you?

927
01:08:54,326 --> 01:08:55,737
In your shell.

928
01:08:57,701 --> 01:08:58,911
Come on.

929
01:09:09,534 --> 01:09:13,481
In China, do boys like me get bullied?

930
01:09:15,159 --> 01:09:16,369
"Bullied"?

931
01:09:17,576 --> 01:09:21,084
You know, like when people treat you
badly because you're clever.

932
01:09:21,743 --> 01:09:23,082
Why would they do that?

933
01:09:24,659 --> 01:09:27,125
I wish England was more like China.

934
01:09:27,368 --> 01:09:29,750
I wish China was more like here.

935
01:09:30,826 --> 01:09:33,920
In China we have to succeed for the family.

936
01:09:35,243 --> 01:09:37,246
Especially for Uncle Deng.

937
01:09:40,326 --> 01:09:44,830
Some people say that I am only here
because of him.

938
01:09:45,576 --> 01:09:48,919
That's not true. No, you're really clever.

939
01:09:50,326 --> 01:09:51,571
Thank you.

940
01:09:53,368 --> 01:09:55,122
And you're very nice.

941
01:09:57,118 --> 01:10:00,128
Prawn ball. Turtle boy.

942
01:10:50,451 --> 01:10:51,826
Alternate team seating.

943
01:10:52,409 --> 01:10:55,254
UK team member, Chinese team member.

944
01:10:55,367 --> 01:10:58,994
Alternative seating.
UK team member, Chinese team member.

945
01:11:04,867 --> 01:11:06,621
IMO conditions apply.

946
01:11:08,492 --> 01:11:11,029
White card if you request some paper.

947
01:11:12,659 --> 01:11:14,283
A blue for water.

948
01:11:15,867 --> 01:11:17,705
Green if you need to go to the toilet.

949
01:11:19,659 --> 01:11:23,286
Yellow to ask a question
but only in the first half-hour.

950
01:11:24,409 --> 01:11:29,078
And red if you've left the gas on at home
or something and you need to leave.

951
01:11:29,992 --> 01:11:34,982
The 6 of you who score highest will
represent Team UK, no "ifs", no "buts".

952
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:41,696
You may begin.

953
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:59,704
"Each integer is coloured
either red, yellow or green."

954
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:04,578
"Show that there always exist A, B, C,"

955
01:12:06,575 --> 01:12:10,154
"such that A, B, C,."

956
01:12:10,825 --> 01:12:13,492
"A plus B, A plus C..."

957
01:12:14,325 --> 01:12:19,528
"A plus B, A plus C, B plus C
and A plus B plus C"

958
01:12:20,117 --> 01:12:21,657
"are all the same colour."

959
01:13:10,533 --> 01:13:14,954
Right! No point in
dilly-dallying, I suppose.

960
01:13:15,075 --> 01:13:17,825
I'll pin your scores up on the board
in a second.

961
01:13:18,783 --> 01:13:20,656
The five outstanding students

962
01:13:20,783 --> 01:13:24,540
guaranteed a place at the IMO
in Cambridge this year are...

963
01:13:26,241 --> 01:13:27,273
Isaac.

964
01:13:28,116 --> 01:13:29,361
Lee Jing.

965
01:13:30,325 --> 01:13:31,320
Rebecca.

966
01:13:32,325 --> 01:13:34,114
Pav. And Ben.

967
01:13:38,033 --> 01:13:41,790
The last place was very tight
between Nathan and Luke.

968
01:13:41,908 --> 01:13:45,357
Both scores somewhat disappointing, but
one of you will have to go to Cambridge.

969
01:13:46,116 --> 01:13:49,565
So, by the smallest fraction of a point,

970
01:13:50,575 --> 01:13:53,111
the last place on the team goes to...

971
01:13:56,574 --> 01:13:57,535
Nathan.

972
01:13:59,658 --> 01:14:03,000
The 6 of you will be hosting
the Chinese team at your own homes

973
01:14:03,116 --> 01:14:05,333
and I'll see you all in
Cambridge next week.

974
01:14:05,449 --> 01:14:07,204
Onward, Christian soldiers.

975
01:14:29,908 --> 01:14:32,539
A real Taiwanese last supper!

976
01:14:33,408 --> 01:14:37,698
"As the old proverb say,
Slowly, slowly, catchy prawn."

977
01:14:37,991 --> 01:14:41,748
Now, you put your bait on the hooks
and you put your hooks in the water.

978
01:14:42,991 --> 01:14:46,535
Don't worry, Nathan.
I only just made the team myself.

979
01:14:48,949 --> 01:14:50,159
We should be celebrating!

980
01:14:52,824 --> 01:14:53,915
Okay.

981
01:14:56,491 --> 01:14:57,996
He's so strange.

982
01:14:58,116 --> 01:14:59,835
At least we don't
have to see him again.

983
01:15:02,657 --> 01:15:03,653
What a dick.

984
01:15:06,366 --> 01:15:07,954
Ah! Ah!
What do I do?

985
01:15:11,824 --> 01:15:13,483
Yes!

986
01:15:18,824 --> 01:15:20,413
I'm sorry.

987
01:15:21,699 --> 01:15:22,825
How's it going?
Good.

988
01:15:22,949 --> 01:15:24,454
- These two are tender?
- Not yet.

989
01:15:24,574 --> 01:15:27,857
Not yet. I have this all under control,
thank you very much. It's fine.

990
01:15:27,991 --> 01:15:29,994
Okay, okay. You're the expert.

991
01:15:30,574 --> 01:15:33,324
I think these ones... Can I get a plate?

992
01:15:38,199 --> 01:15:39,195
Smells good.

993
01:15:43,241 --> 01:15:47,033
Have you seen this?
Now that's what I call a dead prawn.

994
01:15:47,824 --> 01:15:49,981
This prawn is definitely deceased.

995
01:15:50,115 --> 01:15:52,569
When I bought it half-hour ago,
you assured me

996
01:15:52,574 --> 01:15:55,525
that its lack of movement was due to
it being tired and shagged out.

997
01:15:55,907 --> 01:15:57,247
Oh, my God.

998
01:15:58,199 --> 01:15:59,787
"Say, No, no, it's resting."

999
01:16:01,157 --> 01:16:04,251
- What?
- Say, "No, no, it's resting."

1000
01:16:06,615 --> 01:16:07,741
No, no, it's resting.

1001
01:16:07,865 --> 01:16:11,445
All right, then.
Well, if it's resting, I'll wake it up.

1002
01:16:12,532 --> 01:16:15,875
Hello, Prawny. Prawny, wake up!

1003
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:20,000
This prawn wouldn't wake up
if I put 4,000 volts through it.

1004
01:16:20,115 --> 01:16:22,581
It's bleedin' demised.
It has ceased to be.

1005
01:16:22,740 --> 01:16:24,779
It's expired and gone to meet its maker.

1006
01:16:24,907 --> 01:16:26,875
This is an ex-prawn!

1007
01:16:31,449 --> 01:16:33,606
Seriously, Luke, what are you?

1008
01:16:35,449 --> 01:16:36,989
Well, what are you, Isaac?

1009
01:16:38,157 --> 01:16:41,251
I find everything so easy
and I have everything.

1010
01:16:41,365 --> 01:16:44,625
"And I'm gonna go out of my way to make
sure that you're not happy at all.."

1011
01:16:53,573 --> 01:16:56,366
Remarkable bird,
the Norwegian Blue. Beautiful plumage.

1012
01:16:56,448 --> 01:16:59,329
<i>The plumage don't enter into it.
It's stone-dead.</i>

1013
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:01,203
No, no, no. It's resting.

1014
01:17:01,657 --> 01:17:05,106
<i>All Right, then.
If it's resting, I'll wake it up.</i>

1015
01:17:05,823 --> 01:17:10,872
Hello, Polly! I got a nice Cuttlefish
for you when you wake up, Polly Parrot!

1016
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:12,823
There, it moved.
No, it didn't.

1017
01:17:24,115 --> 01:17:25,276
Nathan.

1018
01:17:25,948 --> 01:17:27,193
Nathan...

1019
01:17:27,990 --> 01:17:29,365
It's fine.

1020
01:17:31,573 --> 01:17:32,604
I've done it before.

1021
01:17:34,198 --> 01:17:36,521
Just got a bit carried away this time.

1022
01:17:40,407 --> 01:17:42,315
How did your mum and dad explain it to you?

1023
01:17:44,406 --> 01:17:45,497
When they found out.

1024
01:17:48,615 --> 01:17:50,155
I presume you've been diagnosed.

1025
01:17:53,156 --> 01:17:55,539
Mine said it made me unique.

1026
01:17:58,990 --> 01:18:01,704
"No one wants to be ordinary," they said.

1027
01:18:05,781 --> 01:18:07,820
It's all right being weird

1028
01:18:09,281 --> 01:18:10,692
as long as you're gifted.

1029
01:18:13,740 --> 01:18:16,122
But if you're not gifted, then...

1030
01:18:19,073 --> 01:18:20,483
That just leaves weird.

1031
01:18:21,573 --> 01:18:22,913
Doesn't it?

1032
01:18:24,698 --> 01:18:26,073
You are gifted, Luke.

1033
01:18:29,323 --> 01:18:31,112
I don't even enjoy it.

1034
01:18:32,656 --> 01:18:33,782
Maths.

1035
01:18:35,990 --> 01:18:37,613
Isn't that stupid?

1036
01:18:43,281 --> 01:18:44,692
What's the point?

1037
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:09,899
Right, away you go.

1038
01:19:15,739 --> 01:19:17,493
Your chariot awaits.

1039
01:19:19,448 --> 01:19:21,700
Nathan, can I have a word?

1040
01:19:31,906 --> 01:19:36,410
When I speak to people
of a non-mathematical nature,

1041
01:19:37,989 --> 01:19:42,315
they always struggle with the notion
that mathematics can be beautiful.

1042
01:19:43,406 --> 01:19:46,748
But if beauty is truth and truth is beauty,

1043
01:19:47,781 --> 01:19:50,910
well, then surely mathematics
is the most beautiful thing of all.

1044
01:19:51,697 --> 01:19:52,693
<i>No?</i>

1045
01:19:55,156 --> 01:19:58,439
There is rare beauty in your work, Nathan.

1046
01:19:59,781 --> 01:20:03,953
But you are unpredictable and inconsistent.
Which worries me.

1047
01:20:05,156 --> 01:20:08,190
You need to focus
if you're gonna win a medal.

1048
01:20:08,906 --> 01:20:10,782
And don't be distracted
by your Chinese guest.

1049
01:20:46,114 --> 01:20:47,524
<i>Oh, cai hong!</i>

1050
01:20:48,614 --> 01:20:51,707
- Uh, the rainbow.
- Yeah, rainbow, cai hong.

1051
01:20:52,614 --> 01:20:54,273
- Cai hong.
- Yeah.

1052
01:20:54,405 --> 01:20:56,029
- Cai hong.
- Cai hong.

1053
01:20:58,572 --> 01:21:00,196
So beautiful.

1054
01:21:20,155 --> 01:21:22,538
Welcome home. Hi, darling.
Hey!

1055
01:21:23,030 --> 01:21:24,820
Hi, darling... Hi!
Welcome back.

1056
01:21:27,030 --> 01:21:29,780
Hi! Hello, sweetheart.

1057
01:21:30,364 --> 01:21:31,359
- Hi.
- Hi.

1058
01:21:31,489 --> 01:21:33,811
- How do you pronounce your name?
- Uh, Zhang Mei.

1059
01:21:33,988 --> 01:21:36,833
- Zhang Mei. Julie. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1060
01:21:38,363 --> 01:21:40,958
We put a little... Wait,
it's coming round now.

1061
01:21:40,985 --> 01:21:42,336
Cambridge, here we come!

1062
01:21:42,447 --> 01:21:44,663
Whoo-whom whoo-whoo!

1063
01:21:46,113 --> 01:21:47,489
Why did you get my train set out?

1064
01:21:49,488 --> 01:21:51,029
Um... Nathan...

1065
01:21:53,697 --> 01:21:54,823
Sorry.

1066
01:21:58,197 --> 01:22:00,520
- Welcome to England.
- Thank you.

1067
01:22:06,030 --> 01:22:07,535
Nathan.

1068
01:22:07,780 --> 01:22:10,696
Nathan, I'm sorry. I'm
sorry about the train.

1069
01:22:16,780 --> 01:22:18,818
So that's Zhang Mei, is it?

1070
01:22:19,988 --> 01:22:21,529
What's she like?

1071
01:22:22,072 --> 01:22:23,861
She's... She's clever.

1072
01:22:26,113 --> 01:22:27,358
And she's nice, too.

1073
01:22:28,947 --> 01:22:31,518
Sounds to me like you quite like her.

1074
01:22:32,363 --> 01:22:33,703
Of course I like her.

1075
01:22:34,321 --> 01:22:39,276
Yeah, no, I mean, like:
More than you normally like things.

1076
01:22:39,405 --> 01:22:40,815
You know, uh, like more than...

1077
01:22:43,613 --> 01:22:45,865
Ice cream. Or...

1078
01:22:47,405 --> 01:22:48,685
Or maths.

1079
01:22:49,196 --> 01:22:51,072
I don't like anything
more than I like maths.

1080
01:22:54,155 --> 01:22:56,620
Nathan, darling, I wish
you'd just called me.

1081
01:22:58,405 --> 01:23:00,941
Let me know that you're okay, you know?

1082
01:23:02,655 --> 01:23:03,686
Why?

1083
01:23:04,780 --> 01:23:07,446
Well, because, darling...

1084
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:11,201
I like you...

1085
01:23:13,321 --> 01:23:15,075
More than I like ice cream.

1086
01:23:24,155 --> 01:23:25,660
I said she could have my room.

1087
01:23:28,446 --> 01:23:30,200
That's very gentlemanly of you.

1088
01:23:31,446 --> 01:23:32,822
Isn't that the right thing to do?

1089
01:23:34,196 --> 01:23:35,227
Yes.

1090
01:23:36,571 --> 01:23:39,108
So, I'm... I'm blowing this up
for you then, am I?

1091
01:23:40,696 --> 01:23:43,541
Yeah. But, uh, can I have it in my room?

1092
01:23:46,488 --> 01:23:47,827
Zhang Mei's in there.

1093
01:23:49,363 --> 01:23:50,524
We might want to study.

1094
01:23:58,363 --> 01:24:03,566
So, that man today, he is not your father?

1095
01:24:05,696 --> 01:24:09,524
No, he's my teacher. My father died.

1096
01:24:11,571 --> 01:24:13,230
I'm sorry, Nathan.

1097
01:24:14,988 --> 01:24:16,232
It's not your fault.

1098
01:24:18,446 --> 01:24:22,203
I mean, I feel sad for you.

1099
01:24:23,946 --> 01:24:28,023
It must be hard to lose someone
that you love so much.

1100
01:25:05,862 --> 01:25:07,522
You think it will work?

1101
01:25:07,654 --> 01:25:10,499
100%? I hope so.

1102
01:25:12,987 --> 01:25:16,187
We did it! It actually works.

1103
01:26:04,862 --> 01:26:06,654
Right-oh, observers. It's time to assemble.

1104
01:26:08,904 --> 01:26:10,776
Panama hats, Richard? Really?

1105
01:26:10,904 --> 01:26:12,942
Yes, it was a consensus decision.

1106
01:26:13,070 --> 01:26:15,737
I discussed it with myself
and I decided it would be a good idea.

1107
01:26:16,820 --> 01:26:18,954
Are you sure you're not
too rusty for all this?

1108
01:26:19,070 --> 01:26:21,476
I can manage a bit of shepherding.

1109
01:26:21,612 --> 01:26:24,243
Been Nathan's teacher for 7 years,
I wanna see this through.

1110
01:26:25,153 --> 01:26:26,528
He's a very sensitive kid.

1111
01:26:27,112 --> 01:26:30,525
Yeah, yeah, I suppose children
are like animals.

1112
01:26:31,570 --> 01:26:33,196
You get attached to them after a while.

1113
01:26:40,028 --> 01:26:43,193
Oh, my gosh!
Is this where you're staying?

1114
01:26:44,153 --> 01:26:45,363
Oh, wow.

1115
01:26:47,195 --> 01:26:48,226
<i>Oh...</i>

1116
01:26:52,153 --> 01:26:53,315
Well...

1117
01:26:53,778 --> 01:26:57,606
So, um, you've got your phone on you
and you know you can call me any time.

1118
01:26:57,612 --> 01:26:58,773
So...

1119
01:27:01,362 --> 01:27:03,365
I'll be thinking of you.

1120
01:27:03,487 --> 01:27:05,205
Okay. Well, goodbye.

1121
01:27:07,362 --> 01:27:08,772
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

1122
01:27:09,237 --> 01:27:10,564
- Bye.
- Bye.

1123
01:27:10,570 --> 01:27:11,566
Bye, darling.

1124
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:22,285
- What are you doing?
- I was taking your hand.

1125
01:27:23,445 --> 01:27:24,606
Come on!

1126
01:27:27,820 --> 01:27:28,910
You let go!

1127
01:27:29,028 --> 01:27:31,979
Isaac Newton. G.H. Hardy.

1128
01:27:32,736 --> 01:27:35,522
Ramanujan. Bertrand Russell.

1129
01:27:36,361 --> 01:27:39,076
They all began their
mathematical journeys here.

1130
01:27:39,903 --> 01:27:43,186
Trinity alumni have accumulated
32 Nobel prizes

1131
01:27:43,320 --> 01:27:45,892
and no less than 4 Fields Medals.

1132
01:27:46,445 --> 01:27:48,768
Although Russell did go off the rails
somewhat later in his career.

1133
01:27:48,986 --> 01:27:53,194
But nevertheless,
this is the most prestigious place

1134
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:57,266
to study mathematics on the planet.
And you are here.

1135
01:27:57,653 --> 01:28:01,600
Because they are the past
and you are the future.

1136
01:28:02,570 --> 01:28:03,909
So don't let me down.

1137
01:28:08,736 --> 01:28:09,904
Ladies and gentlemen,

1138
01:28:10,570 --> 01:28:13,071
I would like to welcome you!
To the 59th International.

1139
01:28:13,195 --> 01:28:15,696
Mathematical Olympiad in Cambridge.

1140
01:28:20,028 --> 01:28:21,817
Please welcome Australia.

1141
01:28:34,028 --> 01:28:36,031
A warm welcome for Bangladesh.

1142
01:28:39,986 --> 01:28:41,147
Canada.

1143
01:28:43,986 --> 01:28:46,368
The People's Republic of China.

1144
01:28:54,403 --> 01:28:57,188
A round of applause for United Kingdom.

1145
01:29:23,611 --> 01:29:25,400
- Nathan?
- Yeah?

1146
01:29:28,861 --> 01:29:30,141
I can't sleep.

1147
01:29:31,777 --> 01:29:36,447
You can, uh, stay here if you want.
Like... Like at home.

1148
01:29:40,944 --> 01:29:42,153
What are you reading?

1149
01:29:45,777 --> 01:29:49,061
It's the 10 Years of
Mathematical Challenges,

1150
01:29:49,902 --> 01:29:51,692
'97 to '06 edition.

1151
01:30:04,777 --> 01:30:05,773
Oh.

1152
01:30:07,569 --> 01:30:08,849
I'm sorry.

1153
01:30:34,027 --> 01:30:35,497
Is that right?

1154
01:30:36,027 --> 01:30:37,058
Yes.

1155
01:30:52,485 --> 01:30:53,860
Are you okay?

1156
01:31:15,443 --> 01:31:18,786
I am glad I am here with you.

1157
01:31:21,152 --> 01:31:22,361
Me, too.

1158
01:32:55,276 --> 01:32:58,690
I can't be here with people
thinking I don't deserve it.

1159
01:32:59,443 --> 01:33:01,849
Why don't you just stay
until the end of the competition?

1160
01:33:02,193 --> 01:33:03,532
No, Nathan!

1161
01:33:08,984 --> 01:33:11,118
Nathan...

1162
01:33:12,484 --> 01:33:14,073
Just because...

1163
01:33:16,109 --> 01:33:19,144
Just because I'm going, it...

1164
01:33:22,401 --> 01:33:24,404
It does not mean that...

1165
01:33:26,568 --> 01:33:30,266
I don't find myself liking you.

1166
01:34:12,776 --> 01:34:14,565
Excuse me. Sorry.

1167
01:34:14,734 --> 01:34:16,951
Nathan? Um...

1168
01:34:18,567 --> 01:34:20,725
Did you get into trouble? About Zhang Mei?

1169
01:34:23,109 --> 01:34:27,186
I think I might have accidentally

1170
01:34:27,317 --> 01:34:30,198
sort of mentioned something to someone.

1171
01:34:31,859 --> 01:34:35,202
I didn't mean to hurt anyone. It's just...

1172
01:34:39,026 --> 01:34:40,436
Anyway...

1173
01:34:42,359 --> 01:34:43,698
I'm sorry.

1174
01:34:50,609 --> 01:34:51,735
Oi!
Oggy!

1175
01:34:51,859 --> 01:34:53,767
Oi!
Oggy, Oggy, Oggy!

1176
01:34:53,901 --> 01:34:55,240
Oi, Oi, Oi!

1177
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:02,311
Hello, Nathan.

1178
01:35:02,442 --> 01:35:06,982
I know, I know, I know. I know you said
not to bother you, but I just, um...

1179
01:35:07,109 --> 01:35:09,525
Well, I just wanted to...
I wanted to cheer on Team Nathan.

1180
01:35:10,692 --> 01:35:12,032
Go, Nathan!

1181
01:35:12,859 --> 01:35:15,869
Anyway, um, I'll be
waiting outside and, uh...

1182
01:35:16,650 --> 01:35:17,646
Best of luck, darling.

1183
01:35:18,484 --> 01:35:20,392
There's no such thing as luck.

1184
01:35:22,484 --> 01:35:23,480
No.

1185
01:36:05,567 --> 01:36:06,693
Nathan.

1186
01:36:07,358 --> 01:36:10,938
I'm gonna be circling, so I'll try and
slip you some of the answers, all right?

1187
01:36:11,483 --> 01:36:12,693
That's cheating.

1188
01:36:13,692 --> 01:36:15,031
You know I was joking.

1189
01:36:16,858 --> 01:36:18,139
You're gonna be all right.

1190
01:36:28,067 --> 01:36:31,575
4 hours and 30 minutes.
You may begin.

1191
01:36:40,567 --> 01:36:45,142
"4n squared trains
are arranged in a 2n x 2n square"

1192
01:36:45,608 --> 01:36:48,607
"and each is painted with
one of 4 colours."

1193
01:36:48,608 --> 01:36:53,491
<i>"Every 2 x 2 square of trains
involves each of the 4 colours."</i>

1194
01:36:55,900 --> 01:36:58,306
"Every 2 x 2 square of trains..."

1195
01:36:59,358 --> 01:37:02,937
<i>"Every 2 x 2 square of trains
involves each of the 4 colours."</i>

1196
01:37:03,066 --> 01:37:04,975
"Prove that the trains..."

1197
01:37:06,983 --> 01:37:11,274
"Prove that the trains on
the corners of the 2n x 2n square"

1198
01:37:11,400 --> 01:37:12,988
"are painted with different colours."

1199
01:38:01,024 --> 01:38:04,782
It must be hard to lose someone
that you love so much.

1200
01:38:44,149 --> 01:38:45,654
What's the matter, mate?

1201
01:38:56,857 --> 01:38:58,363
Nathan?

1202
01:38:58,774 --> 01:38:59,983
Nathan!

1203
01:39:01,524 --> 01:39:02,650
Nathan!

1204
01:39:10,524 --> 01:39:13,191
Open the door. Martin, open the door!

1205
01:39:13,857 --> 01:39:16,323
Open the door, Martin. Martin!

1206
01:39:17,066 --> 01:39:18,275
Martin!

1207
01:39:22,524 --> 01:39:23,685
Nathan?

1208
01:39:25,441 --> 01:39:26,567
Nathan!

1209
01:39:29,982 --> 01:39:31,606
- Where's he going?
- I don't know.

1210
01:39:32,691 --> 01:39:34,983
He just wanted to go, Julie.
I could see it in his eyes.

1211
01:39:35,024 --> 01:39:39,231
And I'm sorry,
I didn't wanna stop him. I'm sorry.

1212
01:39:40,649 --> 01:39:41,929
It's okay.

1213
01:39:51,357 --> 01:39:52,519
Nathan?

1214
01:39:55,024 --> 01:39:56,363
Nathan?

1215
01:40:26,940 --> 01:40:29,323
Zhang Mei said that she liked me.

1216
01:40:30,649 --> 01:40:31,775
Right.

1217
01:40:32,940 --> 01:40:34,185
That's a...

1218
01:40:36,565 --> 01:40:37,940
That's a good thing, isn't it?

1219
01:40:41,565 --> 01:40:44,232
And do you... Do you think that you might

1220
01:40:44,690 --> 01:40:48,447
have those kind of feelings, too?

1221
01:40:49,898 --> 01:40:51,688
- I don't know.
- Hmm.

1222
01:40:52,690 --> 01:40:55,357
I've been trying to work it out. But...

1223
01:40:57,148 --> 01:41:00,692
I found a formula. I just
can't understand it.

1224
01:41:02,815 --> 01:41:05,980
Well, as far as I know, Nathan,
no one ever has.

1225
01:41:07,940 --> 01:41:11,519
I know that when... When I'm around her,

1226
01:41:12,690 --> 01:41:14,977
my brain works differently.

1227
01:41:16,565 --> 01:41:22,147
And my body feels strange and I don't
know what it means or why it matters.

1228
01:41:23,482 --> 01:41:24,951
Why it matters?

1229
01:41:26,523 --> 01:41:28,277
It matters because...

1230
01:41:30,773 --> 01:41:31,769
Well, when...

1231
01:41:33,190 --> 01:41:35,323
When somebody loves you,

1232
01:41:37,315 --> 01:41:41,522
it means that they see something in you...

1233
01:41:43,690 --> 01:41:47,198
That they think is worth something.
So it sort of...

1234
01:41:49,148 --> 01:41:50,902
It adds value to you.

1235
01:41:55,606 --> 01:41:57,017
But it can be hard...

1236
01:41:59,106 --> 01:42:02,686
You know,
when you love someone and they...

1237
01:42:02,815 --> 01:42:06,477
They show no sign that
they love you back, then it's...

1238
01:42:07,190 --> 01:42:09,904
Then it's unequal. Or, um...

1239
01:42:12,315 --> 01:42:14,946
When... When someone you love...

1240
01:42:19,856 --> 01:42:21,895
ls subtracted from you...

1241
01:42:25,440 --> 01:42:29,944
Then it feels like, you know,
that your value is less than it was.

1242
01:42:30,773 --> 01:42:32,527
Does that make sense?

1243
01:42:40,106 --> 01:42:41,896
Why did he have to go?

1244
01:42:43,606 --> 01:42:45,017
I don't know.

1245
01:42:46,564 --> 01:42:48,722
- It just doesn't make sense.
- I know.

1246
01:42:51,064 --> 01:42:54,158
It never will. It was an accident.

1247
01:42:55,231 --> 01:42:56,890
Things made sense when I was with him.

1248
01:42:57,523 --> 01:42:59,028
But why? Why...

1249
01:43:00,564 --> 01:43:02,887
What did he do that I don't?

1250
01:43:04,106 --> 01:43:07,365
How did he make sense of things for you?

1251
01:43:14,481 --> 01:43:15,607
Nathan?

1252
01:43:17,314 --> 01:43:21,107
I don't know,
he made me laugh and...

1253
01:43:23,356 --> 01:43:25,264
He stuck chips up his nose.

1254
01:43:26,398 --> 01:43:27,488
What?

1255
01:43:30,314 --> 01:43:32,353
He stuck chips up his nose?

1256
01:43:37,772 --> 01:43:39,906
Oh, okay, well, I'll
stick a chip up my nose.

1257
01:43:43,272 --> 01:43:44,742
Talk to me now?

1258
01:43:51,189 --> 01:43:52,351
Nathan?

1259
01:43:55,606 --> 01:43:56,767
Nathan.

1260
01:43:58,231 --> 01:44:00,613
Nathan, it's all right. It's okay.

1261
01:44:03,064 --> 01:44:04,309
It hurts.

1262
01:44:05,939 --> 01:44:07,907
I know, darling. Me, too.

1263
01:44:13,356 --> 01:44:14,825
Come here.

1264
01:44:14,939 --> 01:44:16,444
It's all right.

1265
01:44:17,939 --> 01:44:21,518
It's all right, it's all right, good boy.
It's okay.

1266
01:44:40,897 --> 01:44:42,556
Hey, hey.

1267
01:44:47,147 --> 01:44:48,806
Where is Zhang Mei now?

1268
01:44:50,355 --> 01:44:52,762
She... She's gone to the station.

1269
01:44:54,355 --> 01:44:55,523
Do you wanna fetch her back?

1270
01:44:58,064 --> 01:44:59,060
Yeah.

1271
01:44:59,397 --> 01:45:01,436
Okay, we'd better be quick.

1272
01:45:10,355 --> 01:45:11,446
What?

1273
01:45:13,272 --> 01:45:14,481
Nothing.

1274
01:45:38,688 --> 01:45:43,429
<i> Miss you terribly already
Miss the space between your eyelids

1275
01:45:43,563 --> 01:45:46,135
<i> Where I'd stare through awkward sentences

1276
01:45:46,272 --> 01:45:48,346
<i> And avoid through awkward silence

1277
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:52,984
<i> Miss your teeth when they chatter
when we smoked out in my garden

1278
01:45:53,105 --> 01:45:56,056
<i> When we couldn't sleep for all the heat.

1279
01:45:56,188 --> 01:45:58,262
<i> Soft talk began to harden

1280
01:45:58,397 --> 01:46:00,898
<i> Miss your small hands in the palm of mine

1281
01:46:01,022 --> 01:46:03,060
<i> The fact they're good at making

1282
01:46:03,188 --> 01:46:05,571
<i> Miss your sitting up incessantly

1283
01:46:05,688 --> 01:46:09,943
<i> And the fact you're always
waking in the night

1284
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:15,514
<i> The night

1285
01:46:19,522 --> 01:46:20,683
<i> And I

1286
01:46:22,897 --> 01:46:26,310
<i> I hope for your life

1287
01:46:28,105 --> 01:46:30,641
<i> You forget about mine

1288
01:46:33,021 --> 01:46:36,221
<i> Forget about mine

1289
01:46:41,396 --> 01:46:43,719
<i> Miss your teeth dug in my shoulder

1290
01:46:43,855 --> 01:46:46,237
<i> As we rolled in early mornings

1291
01:46:46,355 --> 01:46:48,263
<i> Miss your arm dying beneath me.

1292
01:46:48,396 --> 01:46:50,933
<i> As I lay there, simply yawning

1293
01:46:51,063 --> 01:46:52,094
<i> Please forget me

1294
01:46:52,230 --> 01:46:53,320
<i> You were right, dear

1295
01:46:53,438 --> 01:46:55,904
<i> I am cold and self-involved

1296
01:46:56,021 --> 01:46:58,428
<i> And though I'll miss you, recent lover

1297
01:46:58,563 --> 01:47:00,780
<i> l am weak and therefore cold

1298
01:47:00,896 --> 01:47:02,935
<i> Get distracted by my music

1299
01:47:03,063 --> 01:47:05,445
<i> Think of nothing else but art

1300
01:47:05,563 --> 01:47:07,886
<i> I'll write my loneliness in poems

1301
01:47:08,021 --> 01:47:10,652
<i> If I can just think how to start

1302
01:47:10,771 --> 01:47:13,094
<i> Dot my I's with eyebrow pencils

1303
01:47:13,230 --> 01:47:15,233
<i> Close my eyelids, hide my eyes

1304
01:47:15,355 --> 01:47:17,677
<i> I'll be idle in my ideals

1305
01:47:17,813 --> 01:47:20,942
<i> Think of nothing else but!

1306
01:47:21,063 --> 01:47:23,280
<i> And I

1307
01:47:24,563 --> 01:47:27,976
<i> And I

1308
01:47:31,646 --> 01:47:34,112
<i> And I

1309
01:47:35,354 --> 01:47:39,183
<i> I hope for your life.

1310
01:47:40,438 --> 01:47:43,472
<i> You can forget about mine

1311
01:47:45,104 --> 01:47:49,644
<i> Just forget about mine

1312
01:47:51,438 --> 01:47:55,017
<i> And mine

1313
01:47:56,813 --> 01:48:00,191
<i> Mine <i>
