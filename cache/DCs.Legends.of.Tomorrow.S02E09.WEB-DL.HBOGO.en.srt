00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,480
<i>Time travel is real,</i>

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,760
<i>and all of history
is vulnerable to attack,</i>

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,680
<i>which is why we must travel
through time</i>

4
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,680
<i>to stop the spread
of these so-called time aberrations</i>

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:11,160
<i>and to erase their damage to history.</i>

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,480
<i>We are a team of outcasts
and misfits,</i>

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,560
<i>so, please, don't call us heroes.</i>

8
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,200
<i>We're Legends.</i>

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,760
<i>Previously,
on</i>Legends Of Tomorrow...

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,400
- Mick has elected to stay.
- Why?

11
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,800
Someone needs to be present
to destroy the Oculus.

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,080
Get him out of here.

13
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,320
He traded his life for ours.
He was a hero.

14
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,720
Leonard.
I must be losing my mind.

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,200
You're not riding ahead, Mick.

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,480
That's why I'm here...

17
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,760
to set you straight.

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,880
The amulet. Why is it so important?

19
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,280
Hand over the box.

20
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,200
I swiped it off Darhk.

21
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,680
You have something we need.

22
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,120
I would like
to broker a deal with you.

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,520
How did you manage to defeat him?

24
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,080
- I gave him the amulet.
- It's a compass.

25
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,120
Compasses generally find things.

26
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,720
Have either of you gentlemen
heard of the Spear of Destiny?

27
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,200
It can be used
to rewrite reality itself.

28
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,040
- How do we find it?
- You remember Captain Rip Hunter?

29
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,280
Cut!

30
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,160
Gideon! What's our status?

31
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,800
<i>The Waverider is surprisingly
not destroyed, Captain.</i>

32
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,600
<i>Though that condition
may not be permanent.</i>

33
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,120
How long will it take
to effect repairs?

34
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,800
<i>Fifteen years.</i>

35
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,040
Well, that won't do.

36
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,000
<i>What is that, Captain?</i>

37
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,840
There are some things, Gideon,
I can't even tell you.

38
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,200
Initiate repair procedures.

39
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,800
<i>Auto-repair engaged.</i>

40
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,120
Shogun Ballistic.

41
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,080
<i>Captain, that is the shutdown code
for my primary syst...</i>

42
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,440
Angels and ministers of grace...

43
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,920
defend us...

44
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,520
You're my best friend.

45
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,920
I love you, man.

46
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,640
What did you hear?

47
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,400
Nothing, absolutely nothing.

48
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,400
{\an5}Though... though if I did,
I suppose I...

49
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,840
I might be flattered.

50
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,560
I wasn't talking to you.

51
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,080
{\an5}Perhaps you've had enough
to drink for one night.

52
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,800
{\an5}That's the point.
I haven't had enough.

53
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,120
{\an5}So, if you weren't talking to me,
then...

54
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,760
- Snart.
- Snart what?

55
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,600
{\an5}I've been talking to Snart.
I've been seeing him lately.

56
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,760
You've been having hallucinations
of Leonard Snart?

57
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,800
If you tell anyone, I'll kill you.

58
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,120
I believe you.

59
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,240
- You can fix me.
- Me?

60
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,760
- You're a doctor.
- Of nuclear physics.

61
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,760
- Same thing.
- Mr. Rory, I can't...

62
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,520
{\an5}You can fix me, but you can't
tell anybody about it.

63
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,800
- You got that?
- Yes.

64
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,040
You got that?

65
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,520
<i>- Ante up
- Yap, that fool</i>

66
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,120
<i>- Ante up
- Kidnap that fool</i>

67
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,200
{\an5}<i>- Get him, get him
- Get him, get him</i>

68
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,600
Nate.

69
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,240
- Nate.
- Nate!

70
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,400
<i>I'm a street regulator</i>

71
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,320
Sorry, guys. It helps me concentrate.

72
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,040
It's 3.00 in the morning.

73
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,840
Amaya and I were trying to sleep.

74
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,000
Not together.

75
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,280
- What are you doing up so late?
- Just trying to figure out

76
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,640
what the Legion of Doom wants
with those two amulets.

77
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,680
The "Legion of Doom"?

78
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,560
Darhk, Merlyn, and the Speedster.

79
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,560
{\an5}It's from a <i>Hanna-Barbera</i> cartoon
I liked when I was a kid.

80
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,720
Sorry, I woke you guys up.

81
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,200
We weren't together.

82
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,000
- He knows, Ray.
- Yeah.

83
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,560
Well, have you figured anything out?

84
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,280
{\an5}Well, I carbon dated the amulet
that Sara took from Darhk in 1987.

85
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,640
Before she gave it back

86
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,240
to the Legion of Doom,
I'm guessing.

87
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,440
{\an5}Yeah, and Gideon puts
the amulet's date of origin

88
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,040
around 30 A.D.

89
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,320
{\an5}Huh... high concentrations
of manganese, copper, and zinc,

90
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,360
- which would make bronze.
- Correct.

91
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,280
{\an5}Now, Roman Centurions put bronze
in all their metalwork

92
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,360
circa 30 A.D.

93
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,040
{\an5}I also sketched the two amulets
the best I could from memory,

94
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,080
{\an5}but they don't match
any artifacts on record.

95
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,640
What if they're not two artifacts?

96
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,800
What if they're one?

97
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,240
Shut up.

98
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,520
The Longinus Medallion.

99
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,800
{\an5}Longinus is the name
generally associated

100
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,000
{\an5}with the Roman Centurion
who pierced the side of Christ

101
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,320
during the Crucifixion.

102
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,080
{\an5}Yeah, he was blind
and got the blood of Jesus

103
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,480
in his eyes,
and then he could see again.

104
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,120
- Look at you.
- What? I went to Sunday school.

105
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,560
{\an5}Now, that blood allegedly
got on the medallion

106
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,320
{\an5}and empowered it and the spear
with magical powers.

107
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,160
Well, why does the Legion of Doom
want the medallion?

108
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,760
"Legion of Doom"?

109
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,080
- Yeah.
- Don't ask.

110
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,720
{\an5}Well, according to legend,
the medallion calls

111
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,240
{\an5}for the spear and basically
takes you right to it.

112
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,680
The spear is also known as
the Holy Lance

113
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,920
or the Spear of Destiny.

114
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,400
{\an5}Hey, hold on,
this all just sounds like

115
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,000
an Indiana Jones movie.

116
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,320
"Raiders of the Lost Ark"
is the reason I became a historian.

117
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,720
{\an5}- Did you know that?
- Okay, so the Legion

118
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,960
{\an5}wanted the medallion
so they could get the spear.

119
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,680
{\an5}But what do they want
with the spear?

120
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,400
Well, the spear
allegedly has the power

121
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,160
to rewrite reality.

122
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,120
But how's that different
from us traveling through time

123
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,520
and making changes to history?

124
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,480
{\an5}Changes to history cause
time quakes and aberrations,

125
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,960
which we can undo.

126
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,880
Changes to reality, however...

127
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,840
those are permanent.

128
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,880
Great.

129
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,640
{\an5}And I just handed them over
the medallion.

130
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,720
Whoa, in exchange for Grey's life.

131
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,840
Any one of us would have
made that call.

132
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,520
Would Rip?

133
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,960
So much for sunny California.

134
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,080
When we're done here,
we need to go

135
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,280
to the 1600 block of Vine Street.

136
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,280
- Why, pray tell?
- It's where Frank Sinatra's

137
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,160
star is on the Walk of Fame.
I have always wanted to see it.

138
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,360
I'm not sure if that's part of
our little trinket's itinerary.

139
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,800
I said "when we're done."

140
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,200
As far as magical artifacts go,
this one is frustratingly unspecific.

141
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,120
Actually, like most
magical artifacts,

142
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,480
its ways are nuanced.

143
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,280
That's just a fancy word for vague,

144
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,880
and I'm getting tired of walking.

145
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,840
True, we could use
some transportation.

146
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,320
Oh, wow.

147
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,640
Afternoon, fellas.

148
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,360
Not so fast, buddy.

149
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,720
Wallets. Now.

150
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,640
- Just give us your motorcycles.
- Excuse me?

151
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,160
Give us the bikes,
and we'll let you live.

152
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,960
What are you, some sort
of comedians or something?

153
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,320
Or something.

154
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,440
That charming-looking fellow
is Cal DeVito.

155
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,280
Instead of being killed,
he's supposed to go on

156
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,000
to invent a new carburetor
for shovelhead motorcycles.

157
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,120
As far as aberrations go,
don't you think that's a bit...

158
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,280
Puny? Yeah.

159
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,920
Well, Gideon was going over
autopsy reports, and, well,

160
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,720
I'll just let her tell you. Gideon?

161
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,760
<i>Both gentlemen were killed
in close quarters</i>

162
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,760
<i>with sezuki strikes to the xiphoid
processes of their sternums.</i>

163
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,800
A League of Assassins technique.

164
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,840
Weren't Darhk and Merlyn former LOA?

165
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,960
They must be getting closer
to the Holy Lance.

166
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,640
I'm leaning toward Spear of Destiny.

167
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,920
- I prefer Holy Lance.
- Can't imagine why.

168
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,360
Gideon, plot a course for the point
of origin of the aberration.

169
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,760
<i>I already have, Captain.</i>

170
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,720
<i>Hollywood, 1967.</i>

171
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,160
Is the professor all right?

172
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,840
Depends on what you mean
by "all right."

173
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,800
He's helping Mick with something.
I don't know.

174
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,520
He's being kind of quiet about it.

175
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,680
Well, I hope he figures it out soon,

176
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,040
'cause if the Legion of Doom
is here...

177
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,680
Really like how
the name's catching on.

178
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,040
We're gonna need Mick and Firestorm.

179
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,200
Let's figure out
what's going on first.

180
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,520
Look, all I know is
Gideon said the motorcycles

181
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,920
Darhk and Merlyn stole are here.

182
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,760
What, so we're just
supposed to walk around

183
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,200
until we see a sign
that says, "this way"?

184
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,280
Good idea.

185
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,280
Subjugating the world
to your rule isn't saving it.

186
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,040
You would create a wasteland,
and call it peace.

187
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,720
Do not misquote Tacitus to me.

188
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,720
I knew him well.
I lived long enough

189
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,120
to watch civilizations
rise and fall...

190
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,560
Cut, just stop. Cut, please.

191
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,720
All right, cut.

192
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:53,880
And everyone take five.

193
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,120
I just need to... think.

194
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,040
George.

195
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,400
What do I do?

196
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,280
- I mean, it wasn't that bad.
- What?

197
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,040
You saw him. I just can't seem

198
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,560
to get Peter to bring
any menace to the part.

199
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,280
- I may need to recast.
- No, no, no.

200
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,760
You don't have time to recast, okay?

201
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,280
Your thesis film is due
in less than a month.

202
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,960
I know, I know, but a film is only

203
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,560
as good as its villain,
and I have an antagonist

204
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,680
who is as threatening
as a wiener dog.

205
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,160
- Rip Hunter.
- No, I'm the director.

206
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,240
Rip's being played
by Adam Glassman.

207
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,880
He's probably at craft services.

208
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:34,840
It's nice to see your reputation
for dry humor is well-earned.

209
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,240
You see,
this is what I am talking about.

210
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,800
You guys are good.

211
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,920
Yeah, these are...
these are great props.

212
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Did you make these yourself?

213
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,880
Hey, we are on
something of a clock here.

214
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,400
Oh, my God. It's Rip.

215
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,320
Don't worry. We got you, Rip.

216
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,960
Who the hell are you guys?

217
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,200
We don't have time for this.

218
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,000
Get out of here. Save yourself.

219
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,880
- No, what about you?
- I can't leave my film in there.

220
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,000
Get out of here, man!
No film is worth losing your life!

221
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,720
Get Rip out of here.

222
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,200
- Hey, come on, we gotta go.
- Get... away... from... me.

223
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,880
What the hell, man?

224
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,720
Fall back.

225
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,640
- Stay right there!
- Hands! Hands!

226
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,400
Freeze! Don't move!

227
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,640
- Hey.
- Where do you think you're going?

228
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,760
My movie's inside.

229
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,280
- These lunatics just showed up.
- Do you know these people?

230
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,840
- No, no, no, I...
- Against the wall, long hair.

231
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,320
What? No, but my movie...

232
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,120
Can wait. You're under arrest.

233
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
What?

234
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,080
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

235
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,360
Well, that
went apocalyptically awful.

236
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,880
I got Nate and Amaya researching
where the police took Rip.

237
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,200
We'll spring him, and then...

238
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,640
We'll find out what the hell
is going on with him.

239
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,680
Dude tried to bludgeon me
with this...

240
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,720
non-lethal weapon.

241
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,760
Look, we don't know
how long he was in 1967.

242
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,040
He could be suffering
from time drift,

243
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,440
which is why he doesn't remember us.

244
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,560
The question is how?

245
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,360
Well, he could have
time-scattered himself

246
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,480
like he did with us.

247
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,760
Nah, he sent us his final message
after scattering us.

248
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,400
He wouldn't have been able to use it
for a second time.

249
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,440
Well, he got here somehow
and so did Darhk and Merlyn.

250
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,080
- The Legion of Doom.
- I'm not calling them that.

251
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,160
- Okay.
- But if they came to 1967

252
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,200
looking for Rip, that means...

253
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,800
The medallion must have
led them there.

254
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,880
Rip has the Spear of Destiny.

255
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,440
We gotta bust him out of jail
before they get to him first.

256
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,480
And ever since, I've had...

257
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,080
the fear of giant toads.

258
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,960
Mr. Rory, while I appreciate
the thoroughness of insights,

259
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,240
perhaps we could focus
on the issue at hand.

260
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,520
I thought shrinks liked mommy talk.

261
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,600
I'm not a shr...

262
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,520
You know, I think I've heard
enough on that subject.

263
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,360
Now, when did you first
encounter the apparition?

264
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,440
The ghost of Mr. Snart,
when did he first appear?

265
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,760
Back in Chicago.

266
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,040
Can you remember anything specific?

267
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,000
Something that might have
triggered the vision?

268
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,560
He said something
about setting me straight.

269
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,440
- Why do you think he'd say that?
- I don't know. Maybe he's...

270
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,000
Captain, hello.

271
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,080
How...
What can we do for you?

272
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,400
It's Rip. Here's here in 1967.

273
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,600
That's astonishing. How?

274
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,200
We don't know, but Damien Darhk
and Malcolm Merlyn are after him,

275
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,160
which means you two
cannot sit this one out.

276
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,240
Of course, my apologies.

277
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,880
I was just helping
Mr. Rory with his... migraine.

278
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,120
Yes, I have a very bad headache.

279
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,280
Well, you're gonna have to
suck it up,

280
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,480
'cause I need your help
breaking Rip out of jail.

281
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,560
What's he doing in prison?

282
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,240
And how do you plan on
breaking him out?

283
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,640
It involves you playing a shrink.

284
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,040
Do you think you can do it?

285
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,520
- If I must.
- Great.

286
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,440
- Good day.
- Can I help you?

287
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,720
Yes, I believe you have
one of my patients in custody.

288
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,800
Name?

289
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,440
His name...

290
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,880
Gideon, a little help?

291
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,160
<i>According to his mug shot,
he was booked as "Phil Gasmer."</i>

292
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,320
Phillip Gasmer.

293
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,840
It's imperative that he be released
into my custody immediately.

294
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,600
He suffers from delusions
of being pursued

295
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,760
by futuristic spacemen.

296
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,480
Oh, yeah. That guy.

297
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,560
This way.

298
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,880
Astonishing.

299
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,000
It's really you.

300
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,760
Yeah, it's me. Who are you?

301
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:48,880
I'm your doctor, Mr. Gasmer.
I'm here to take care of you.

302
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,120
I have never laid eyes on you
before in my life.

303
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,320
Memory problems are
a part of the delusion.

304
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,800
I'll have to admit him.
He can't be treated here.

305
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,760
No, don't leave!
This man is not my doctor.

306
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,000
I am not crazy!

307
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,960
Hey, I know, I know. It's okay.

308
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:09,640
Look, my name is Sara Lance.
This is Mick Rory and Martin Stein.

309
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,200
We're your friends.

310
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,080
- Two of them are.
- You're one of them.

311
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,320
Help!

312
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,160
- Hey, okay, hey, hey, hey.
- Help! Help!

313
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,320
Listen to me, all right?
Calm down.

314
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,800
We're here to help you.
You gotta trust me.

315
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,720
Your name is Rip Hunter.

316
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,280
Rip Hunter is a figment
of my imagination.

317
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,800
Help!

318
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,920
Mick.

319
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,880
We've got Rip.

320
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,520
We're headed
for the extraction point.

321
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,720
- Oh, no.
- What is it?

322
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,840
Can I help you?

323
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,720
Hey.

324
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,640
<i>Sara, you got incoming.</i>

325
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,680
<i>Darhk and Merlyn
just entered the precinct.</i>

326
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,080
Yeah, I see them.
They're blocking our escape.

327
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,400
There must be another way out.

328
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,000
Ray, how well can you
fly the Waverider?

329
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,280
<i>Thought you'd never ask.</i>

330
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,920
Wait, you know how to fly the ship?

331
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,760
Sure do. I just have to channel
my inner Han Solo.

332
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,400
- Gideon does most of the work.
- She does?

333
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,080
<i>- I do.</i>
- Huh.

334
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,160
Where to, Cap?

335
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,240
All right, we're here.

336
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,840
Get to the cargo bay.

337
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,080
Ray, do not crash my ship.
You break it, you buy it.

338
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,680
- Get away from me.
- Captain Hunter,

339
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,800
you must listen to us.

340
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,880
Why do you keep calling me that?

341
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,560
Is this some kind of joke?

342
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,920
Rip, just calm down, okay?
We need you to remember.

343
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,200
Your name is Rip Hunter.
You are a Time Master.

344
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,840
You fly the Waverider.
It's a timeship.

345
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,280
Rip! Rip, just wait.

346
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,080
This cannot be happening. You're...

347
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,520
- Am I dreaming?
- Rip?

348
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,360
Oh, God.

349
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,480
Did I drop some really bad acid?

350
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,280
- Rip, be careful.
- Why?

351
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,600
I'm hallucinating.

352
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,320
There is no such thing as Rip Hunter,

353
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,400
and there's no such thing
as a timeship.

354
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,680
There's a...

355
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,040
Get to the ship. Go!

356
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,120
- Let's go!
- Guys, come on!

357
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,280
- Quick! Get on!
- Let's go!

358
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,360
Come on.

359
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,160
Well, Gideon?

360
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,000
<i>I'm afraid the news isn't good,
Captain.</i>

361
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,840
<i>A deep scan reveals
that Captain Hunter's</i>

362
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,600
<i>neural architecture has been
completely restructured.</i>

363
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,840
<i>His limbic system reprogrammed
with a new identity.</i>

364
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,720
So, it isn't time drift.

365
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:34,400
Rip didn't forget who he was.
He... changed.

366
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,880
Reprogrammed?

367
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,560
The technology to alter the brain
at that level doesn't even exist.

368
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,280
Unless Rip's brain was somehow
altered by impulses from the...

369
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,080
from the...

370
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,520
- From the ship's time drive?
- Yeah.

371
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,840
You're talking temporal
electrocution.

372
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,920
As a method of time travel,
it's practically suicidal.

373
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,240
Does that track?

374
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,960
I'm not sure. Excuse me.

375
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,480
- What's his problem?
- I don't know.

376
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,560
<i>Captain Hunter must have
shut down my systems</i>

377
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,920
<i>because he knew
I would never permit him</i>

378
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,360
<i>to make physical contact
with the time drive.</i>

379
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,920
For good reason.
He could have ended up anywhere

380
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,640
and in any period in time.

381
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,120
<i>But before he deactivated me,</i>

382
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,640
<i>he recovered something
from his parlor.</i>

383
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,520
<i>A piece of wood approximately
0.6m long.</i>

384
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,040
A piece of wood?

385
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,400
- The Spear of Destiny?
- Could be.

386
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,800
I'm gonna go tell the others.

387
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,080
I got an idea.

388
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,360
So this would be
a new milestone for you then.

389
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,840
What's your idea?

390
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,440
Why don't we use that thing
to see what's up with my brain?

391
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,320
I doubt you'd find
the results you're hoping for.

392
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,360
These tests are meant
to find neurological changes,

393
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:49,600
while my theory is that your visions
are the result of emotion.

394
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,680
You saying I'm crazy?

395
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,440
I'm saying you're feeling something,

396
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,440
and in the wake of your
partner's demise,

397
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,320
that's perfectly normal.

398
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,160
I don't do feelings.
Run the test, fix my brain.

399
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,840
Hey, what's up?

400
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,800
Sara asked us to find
any physical descriptions

401
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,720
of the spear
that might help us find it.

402
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,600
She thinks Rip had it with him
when he traveled to 1967.

403
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,000
And she, also wants you to work on

404
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:19,000
figuring out, a way to reverse
the effects on Rip

405
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,160
since he came in contact with the...

406
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,600
Time drive.

407
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,120
<i>I've brought up
the time drive's schematics</i>

408
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,400
<i>for you, Dr. Palmer.</i>

409
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,880
Well, how do you expect me
to understand any of that?

410
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,760
Maybe using one of your four PhDs?

411
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,880
I don't have four...

412
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,120
What's wrong?

413
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,280
It's like, I should have
memories that aren't there,

414
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,440
and I should understand
what this is, but I don't.

415
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,880
Yeah, I feel it, too,
it's happening right now.

416
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,760
I'm reading this book
about "Santarion Long-inises,"

417
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,640
and it's just a bunch of words.

418
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,760
How long have the two of you
been feeling like this?

419
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,760
Since...

420
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,480
- Film set.
- Film set.

421
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,080
Mr. Hunter's film.

422
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,600
Sara had Jax go and recover
what he could find.

423
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,840
"Glucas." Wait, isn't that what
you pretend you're allergic to, Ray?

424
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:12,840
What? First of all, my gluten allergy
is very real and challenging.

425
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:17,600
Secondly, it's G. Lucas,
as in George Lucas.

426
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,080
Wait. George Lucas.

427
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,160
How do I know that name?

428
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,720
Gideon, pull up George Lucas
on the historical record.

429
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,760
<i>George Lucas,
born in Modesto, California</i>

430
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,640
<i>on May 14th, 1944.</i>

431
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,560
<i>Named Modesto Hartman's
"Insurance Salesman of the Year"</i>

432
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,640
<i>in 1977, 1980, and 1983.</i>

433
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,480
Three years.

434
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,960
- That doesn't seem right.
- No.

435
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,600
Gideon, is there a version of history

436
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,400
where Mr. Lucas
did something else with his life?

437
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,880
Apparently, this Mr. Lucas
is an aberration.

438
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,080
He's not the aberration.

439
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,880
The Legion of Doom
scaring him is the aberration.

440
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,640
An aberration that directly
affects our lives.

441
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,520
Okay, calm down. Take it back.

442
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,880
Gideon thinks
that the Legion's attack

443
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,480
on Mr. Hunter's film set caused

444
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,720
this George Lucas guy
to quit movie making.

445
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,520
As a result, he never made some
movie about

446
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,640
space battles or another one about
an improbably handsome archaeologist.

447
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,560
And we care about this because...

448
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,440
<i>In the unaltered timeline,
Dr. Palmer sees "Star Wars"</i>

449
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,080
<i>as a child, and is inspired
to become an inventor.</i>

450
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,720
<i>Likewise, Dr. Heywood chooses
to be a historian</i>

451
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,360
<i>after seeing "Indiana Jones"</i>

452
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,840
<i>instead of becoming
a yoga instructor.</i>

453
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,920
- Oh, man.
- Wait, so you're telling me

454
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,240
that because some film geek
drops out of school,

455
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,440
my inventor and my historian
are now essentially useless?

456
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,520
- Yes.
- Hey!

457
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,360
<i>If the aberration
is not corrected, yes.</i>

458
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,720
We need to fix this now.

459
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,120
<i>I fear you may already be too late.</i>

460
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,400
<i>As of today, George Lucas
is no longer enrolled in film school.</i>

461
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,400
There he is.

462
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,960
George Lucas, the man who inspires
both of our careers, supposedly.

463
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,520
Well, let's go inspire him.

464
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,040
Guys, maybe I should do the...

465
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,080
Hey, George. Remember us?

466
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,240
- Hey!
- I had metallic skin.

467
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,360
- No, no.
- Hey.

468
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,360
- No, no, no, no.
- Look, time takes

469
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,920
time to harden, and sooner or later,

470
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,920
we're gonna lose our
superpowers the same way

471
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,040
we're losing our memories.

472
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,040
If you don't make
the movies that you make,

473
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,360
I don't become a brilliant inventor.

474
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,960
And I don't become an
incredibly handsome historian.

475
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,600
I haven't made any movies yet, okay?

476
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,280
I'm still in film school.

477
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,000
- Or I was.
- That's the point.

478
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,080
If you don't go back to school,
you screw up both of our lives.

479
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,680
We don't live up
to our full potential.

480
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,280
And I do not want to be
a heart surgeon.

481
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,040
And I don't want to be
a yoga instructor.

482
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,600
Okay, guys, like I said,
why don't I talk to

483
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,560
- our time aberration?
- Yeah, but...

484
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,040
Stay in school.

485
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,160
I'm sorry about my friends,
they're just...

486
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,400
- Completely insane?
- Yeah.

487
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,040
But what they say is true.

488
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,240
Oh, okay, what... what that you guys

489
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,320
are from the future,
that you've somehow seen

490
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,320
a bunch of movies
that I haven't even made yet?

491
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,640
Well, actually, I'm from the past,
but that's beside the point.

492
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:18,760
Look, George,
I don't care about movies,

493
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,040
but guys like them...

494
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,800
They do.

495
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,800
So, before you get in that car
and drive back to Modesto,

496
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,320
just think about them, okay?

497
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,920
Them, and all the millions
of other people

498
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,040
that your stories
will someday inspire.

499
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,800
The future of the entire
world is at stake.

500
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,160
And you're our only hope.

501
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,320
I've never actually seen
your quarters, Mr. Rory.

502
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,320
They're charming.

503
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,400
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

504
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:53,320
Something unusual,
some sort of receiver.

505
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:58,440
Judging by its design, one sensitive
to gravitation-wave transmissions.

506
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,200
You're telling me
I have an antenna in my head.

507
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,000
Well, the good news is
you're not crazy.

508
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,640
Oh, really?

509
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,320
So, seeing and talking
to Snart's real?

510
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,280
Well, in a sense, yes.
Your former partner

511
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:14,040
was killed when the Oculus exploded
in a blast of temporal energy.

512
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,160
Now, if Mr. Snart was able
to bond with that blast,

513
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,720
the version of him
you're now seeing could be...

514
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,160
How will I put this?

515
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,880
- Like a time-ghost?
- Precisely.

516
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,440
But what I want to know
is how did someone manage

517
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:32,880
to put a device inside your brain
without you knowing it?

518
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,440
<i>You are Chronos.</i>

519
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,120
The Time Masters.

520
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,240
They did some sick things to me
when I was Chronos.

521
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,960
I'm sorry, I forgot.

522
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,040
So, what you're saying
is Snart's stuck out there,

523
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,720
blasted into a billion pieces,
floating around in time and space?

524
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,680
A rather simplistic way
of looking at it, but yes.

525
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,160
- You're an idiot.
- Excuse me?

526
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,640
It didn't have to end like this.

527
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,440
Mr. Snart, is he here?

528
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,800
"Why am I here"?

529
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,200
Why are you here?

530
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,040
You're dead.

531
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,160
What's he saying?

532
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:15,120
He's telling me I've gone soft
because I'm still on the ship.

533
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,040
Doc, Doc...

534
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,520
you gotta get this thing
out of my head.

535
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,160
As I explained,
I'm not a medical doctor...

536
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:29,200
But I'm sure Gideon and I
can figure something out.

537
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,880
- That could work?
- In theory, yes.

538
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,040
Groovy office.

539
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,320
It used to be yours.

540
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,080
Come on, none of this
is bringing back

541
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,000
- any memories for you?
- Listen, lady,

542
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,240
I wish that I could be the guy
you want me to be.

543
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:00,680
"Rip," but I am not.

544
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:06,080
I take it you two were...
pretty tight?

545
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,400
- Yeah, he saved my life.
- Cool.

546
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,160
You.

547
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,600
You saved my life.

548
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,280
I was lost.

549
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,080
You came, you recruited me,
you gave me purpose.

550
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:21,720
Oh, it sounds like Sandra.
She's the hero of my, my movie.

551
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,360
- That's weird that...
- What?

552
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,000
A female hero?

553
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,200
Get with the times, lady.

554
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,240
Yo, we're all in this movie.

555
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,840
I mean, it's different versions
of us,

556
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,320
but this is definitely the team.

557
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,960
Like on, page 89,
my character, Max,

558
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,080
- he saves everybody...
- Hold on.

559
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:42,120
You're telling me that this
burnout used repressed memories

560
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,760
- to write a screenplay?
- That's not all.

561
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,760
He's writing
about the Spear of Destiny.

562
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,040
Which you had with you
when you time-jumped

563
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,560
- off the Waverider.
- I don't know...

564
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,160
- what you are talking about.
- Yes, you do.

565
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,600
- Come on, now.
- What?

566
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,760
I just made it all up.

567
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,240
- The spear is the MacGuffin.
- The what?

568
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,440
The thing in the movie
that everyone's trying to get.

569
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,680
- Well, where is it?
- In the movie?

570
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:08,080
It's in pieces.
Rip just has a fragment of it.

571
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,320
What inspired you to write it
that way?

572
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,200
I don't know.

573
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,680
I just had this old piece of wood.

574
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,400
I thought it'd be a cool movie prop.

575
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,480
Where is it?

576
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,640
I gave it to my prop master, George.

577
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,040
Oh, great.

578
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,720
George Lucas
has the Spear of Destiny.

579
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,960
Glad you changed your mind,
George Lucas.

580
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,160
Going back to film school?
Definitely the right call.

581
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,000
We agree.

582
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,360
Neat trinket. One of the lost
totems of Zambesi, right?

583
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,160
Mr. Lucas, you have something

584
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,680
that we have traveled
a very long way to find.

585
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,600
A piece of the Spear of Destiny.

586
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,320
Where is it?

587
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,040
Lady and gentlemen,
if you don't mind, hands up.

588
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,600
And if you do mind,
we'd be happy to kill you.

589
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,920
- I'll cover George Lucas.
- And I've got...

590
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,520
- What?
- It's not here.

591
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,600
My suit's not here.

592
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,600
I can't steel up.

593
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,920
Maybe I didn't make myself clear.
Put them up!

594
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,440
- He was talking.
- Up. Hands.

595
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,000
- Shut up.
- They're up.

596
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,160
Thank God.
I don't think it's here.

597
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,360
All right, Spec-y four-eyes.

598
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,560
I'm starting to lose my patience
with you.

599
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,000
Where is the spear?

600
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,400
What spear?

601
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,800
We had a little chat with
the members of your film crew,

602
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,920
and they all claimed
the Spear of Destiny was a prop,

603
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,080
and that you, Mr. Lucas,
were its master.

604
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,360
But the movie was done.
I tossed all the props

605
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,720
down the garbage chute.
They were just trash.

606
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,160
But, but, but...

607
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,560
I have one question for you,
Mr. Lucas,

608
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:57,000
and your life depends on
answering me honestly.

609
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,480
Where's the city dump?

610
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:05,800
Gideon, set us down as close
to the location as you can get.

611
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,120
<i>Yes, Captain Lance.</i>

612
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,640
And, while you're at it,
find Mick and...

613
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,760
Grey?

614
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,520
What the hell are you doing?

615
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,000
Brain surgery,
what does it look like?

616
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,120
- It's down there somewhere.
- Good.

617
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,400
'Cause you'll never find it.

618
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,400
You're right.

619
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,760
You're going to.

620
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,960
I could be in Modesto by now.

621
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,560
Shut up and dig, George Lucas.

622
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,240
What kind of superheroes
are you guys anyway, huh?

623
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,040
I mean, sure, they have laser guns,
but aren't you guys

624
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,800
- supposed to have superpowers?
- Well, we had superpowers,

625
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,400
but, because you don't make
"Star Wars,"

626
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,400
I don't become a scientist,
and I don't make the atom suit.

627
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,120
Or the serum
that turns me into steel.

628
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,280
I can't believe
we're all going to die

629
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,000
because of a stupid movie.

630
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,880
Perhaps they need a little incentive.

631
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,440
Oh, agreed.

632
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,520
- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Oh, no.

633
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,360
What was that?
Don't just stand there.

634
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,000
- Try and brace it with something.
- Oh, no.

635
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,680
Oh, no.

636
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,040
- Oh, guys, I found it.
- Don't show him.

637
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,840
What?
We are in a trash compactor.

638
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,560
- We're going to die.
- No, Ray's right.

639
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,760
If we give them what they want,
they're gonna kill us anyway.

640
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,000
Okay, well, then, what do we do?

641
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,200
They're going too slow.

642
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,920
Shoot one of them
to move things along.

643
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,200
- Which one?
- Dealer's choice.

644
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,000
What was that?

645
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,520
This rescue mission
is not going very well, is it?

646
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,960
<i>I'm afraid not, Captain.</i>

647
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:21,200
Would you stop calling me that,
please?

648
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,600
I am not a captain.
I'm just a regular guy.

649
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:27,400
<i>So was Captain Hunter.
He had no superpowers,</i>

650
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,480
<i>unless you count his courage,
intellect, and honor.</i>

651
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,560
Well, what would he do, huh?
Your Captain, if he were here?

652
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,200
You guys,
we, we have to give it them.

653
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,480
- There's no other way.
- There is.

654
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,920
You have to become a filmmaker.
You have to make movies,

655
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,240
and you, George Lucas,
have to believe that.

656
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,000
- What?
- You have to make your movies

657
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,720
so that we can become
who we're supposed to become

658
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,800
so we can save you.

659
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,520
Your movies go on
to change the world.

660
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,400
All you have to do
is believe in yourself.

661
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,360
You have to believe
you're gonna make amazing movies.

662
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,400
You have to believe it
like there's no tomorrow.

663
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,120
Say it, George. Say it out loud.

664
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,040
George Lucas,
what do you really want?

665
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,320
What I really want...

666
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,640
What I really want...

667
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,920
What I really want is to direct!

668
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,320
- About time you showed.
- Where were you?

669
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,160
Always busy, gentleman.
And yet, never late.

670
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,920
So, who do we kill first?

671
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,120
That would be me.

672
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,480
Captain Rip Hunter.

673
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,200
It's been ages.

674
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,720
I was beginning to think
you were dead.

675
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,840
On the contrary, for the first time
in recent memory,

676
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,160
I am finally, truly alive.

677
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,720
Oh, crap.

678
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,520
Hey, does this thing work?

679
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,280
Oh, screw it. Gideon!

680
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,200
Fire! Fire everything!

681
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,200
Go!

682
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,320
Hey, come on!

683
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,720
Rip! Rip!

684
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,720
- Hey, Sara!
- Rip!

685
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,840
We gotta go. He's gone.

686
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,360
- Gideon, get...
- Rip!

687
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,840
You couldn't have got him.

688
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,240
You know that, right?

689
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,360
Yeah.

690
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:43,640
Look, Sara, you can't
beat yourself up about this.

691
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:46,040
It is my responsibility
as Captain to make sure

692
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,200
that everyone gets back
on this ship.

693
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,400
Everyone.

694
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,320
And I failed.

695
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,560
You call getting a piece
of the Spear of Destiny

696
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,440
and the Medallion a failure?

697
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,840
The Legion have nothing.

698
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,400
They have Rip.

699
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,240
We lost him, Jax. Again.

700
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,040
But they won't have him for long.

701
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:13,160
If I know one thing about you,
it's that you don't give up.

702
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,400
When you really want something,
you are unstoppable,

703
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,960
and God help anybody
that tries to get in your way.

704
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,000
We are gonna find him,
and we're gonna bring him home.

705
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,920
Is that a promise?

706
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,760
That's a prophecy.

707
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,280
How are you feeling?

708
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,600
Have you seen our mutual friend
around lately?

709
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,680
No.

710
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,760
That's because
you took the chip out.

711
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:43,920
Well, actually...

712
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,800
You did take the chip out.

713
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,520
Yes, I did,
but after further inspection,

714
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,120
I discovered that the device
hasn't functioned in months.

715
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,720
It seems you've taken
one too many blows to the head.

716
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,280
So, I am going crazy.

717
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,040
I'm seeing a ghost.

718
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,200
There is no ghost.

719
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:06,320
Leonard Snart truly is no more.

720
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,560
Then why do I keep hearing his voice?

721
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,840
That voice inside your head
is your own.

722
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:18,440
If Leonard Snart is second-guessing
your moral obligation to this team...

723
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,120
But that's what I feel.

724
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,480
We all hear contradictory voices

725
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,600
inside our heads, Mr. Rory,
creating, what is known

726
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:31,200
in psychology,
as cognitive dissonance.

727
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,080
- My brains hurts.
- Well, I'm sure it does.

728
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,600
The complexities of human emotion
can at times be mind-boggling.

729
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,640
What's this?

730
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,880
I thought you got your smarts back.

731
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,920
- It's movie night.
- Gideon checked the timeline.

732
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,800
It seems all of George's movies
are now part of history again.

733
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,160
I've almost forgotten
how to perform a median sternotomy.

734
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,680
Well, I guess
I'll just go back to being

735
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,200
a billionaire inventor
with four PhDs.

736
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,840
So, what are we gonna watch first?

737
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,400
I mean, after we watch "Raiders."

738
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,240
Clearly his best film.

739
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,840
Which he never would've made
if he hadn't made "Star Wars" first.

740
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,720
Oh, wait, this one sounds cute.
It's called "Howard the Duck."

741
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,800
- No!
- No!

742
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,160
Okay, maybe movie night wasn't
such a good idea.

743
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,240
Maybe you're right.

744
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,440
After all, we did just lose Rip.

745
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:22,000
I know Nate and I never
really got to know Rip,

746
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,000
but we know how much
he means to the rest of you.

747
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,960
- Yeah.
<i>- Might I offer my opinion?</i>

748
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,400
Fire away.

749
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,040
<i>I believe Captain Hunter
would want you</i>

750
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,640
<i>to enjoy yourselves tonight.</i>

751
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,720
All right, then. Dim the lights.

752
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,280
Gideon, pick the movie.

753
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,560
We'll watch "Raiders" after.

754
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,920
- Then "Empire."
- Then "Last Crusade."

755
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,200
Get comfy.
It's gonna be a long night.

756
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,360
Hello?

757
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,080
Hello?

758
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,840
Is anybody there?

759
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,200
Hey, man.

760
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,560
Welcome, Captain Hunter.

761
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,040
Right.
You know I was bluffing, right?

762
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:14,040
I am not actually Rip Hunter.

763
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,880
My name is Phil.
I am a full-time film student

764
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,600
and part-time recreational drug user.

765
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,920
Seriously regretting the latter.

766
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,040
Oh, I know exactly who you are.

767
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,480
I know that you're
one of the protectors

768
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,360
of the Spear of Destiny,
and I know that you know

769
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,600
where the other pieces are hidden.

770
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,080
I don't know anything.

771
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,400
I swear.

772
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,440
I am not Rip Hunter!

773
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,080
I am...

774
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,520
nobody.

775
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,600
I...

776
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,280
I can't believe
this is happening to me.

777
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,800
You're gonna torture me, aren't you?

778
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,320
Oh, I'm not gonna torture you,
Mr. Hunter.

779
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,400
No?

780
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,680
No.

781
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,360
They are.

782
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,400
No.

783
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,080
No, please, please. Please, please.

784
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,440
Please, let me go!

785
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,640
Let me go!
