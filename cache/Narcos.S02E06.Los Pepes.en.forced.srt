1
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:50,880
Bastard.

2
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:58,970
- Let's make a bet. I'm for the boss.
- I'm betting on the boss, too.

3
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,730
This one is going to be easy.
They always let the boss win.

4
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:05,480
That's true, but if someone's going
to beat him, it's this guy.

5
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:15,070
Tell me something. Are you a pussy?

6
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,330
Son of a bitch.

7
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,430
- What's going on?
- You're a little slow, son.

8
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,970
Careful, son, careful!
Keep looking forward, son!

9
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,940
Oh, shit!

10
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:55,780
All right, boys,
start getting that money out.

11
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,040
...eighty. I'm missing 20.

12
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,130
Oh, it looks like you won some money, eh?

13
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,300
Of course, we're enjoying ourselves, boss.

14
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,670
Very good, son.

15
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:17,380
- Very good.
- What? Did he get pissed?

16
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,800
Hey.

17
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:22,680
Do you know why you won?

18
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,310
That little trick. The same one, right?

19
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,320
Don't be an idiot.
You know why you lost, Pablo?

20
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,480
Why?

21
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:38,070
Because you're a very smart guy,
but you're too stubborn. You understand?

22
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,490
What I understand is I don't like to lose.
Especially because of tricks.

23
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,910
- Someone had to teach you how to lose.
- Yeah, why?

24
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,250
- Very well, you son of a bitch.
- Boss?

25
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,590
- A photo?
- Sure, but not with that pansy.

26
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:59,180
No. You go over there.
Over there, motherfucker.

27
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,930
Cousin.

28
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,600
It's because he doesn't know
how to lose, but that's fine.

29
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,520
- Where are we headed, guys?
- To the whores!

30
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:17,900
Look how they left this place.

31
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,580
We found both the guards.
Stuffed into a trunk, burned alive.

32
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,120
Did anybody see anything?

33
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:34,630
We're sending spotters out, but...
they either come back with nothing or--

34
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,380
- Or what?
- Or they don't come back.

35
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,430
That bitch Judy Moncada did this.

36
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:51,060
But she couldn't do this alone.
No fucking way.

37
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,480
The guys that came at me
had high-end weapons.

38
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,230
Big ones.

39
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,280
Gringo shit.

40
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,830
The Cali cartel.

41
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,670
I fucking know it.

42
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,170
Those sons of bitches will regret it.

43
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:22,430
I will personally burn that fucking city
to the ground.

44
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,840
We don't know that Pablo.

45
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:28,680
Until we know who did it, we can't attack
the Cali cartel. It would be a mistake.

46
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:42,200
Get whoever we can out on the street.
Give them cash.

47
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,200
And if anyone needs more persuasion,
motivate them.

48
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:52,870
Put the word out. We're going to kill
all the bastards who did this.

49
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,460
I know I hit one of them.

50
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:59,000
Let's hope he's still breathing.

51
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,550
Because then...

52
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:10,350
we can find out who that son of a bitch
is working for.

53
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:31,620
PABLO MERRY CHRISTMAS
LOS PEPES

54
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:35,290
HAPPY HOLIDAYS

55
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,370
Good day.

56
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:44,960
In a letter sent to the media, a group
that identifies itself as "Los Pepes,"

57
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,630
an acronym for
"People Persecuted by Pablo Escobar."

58
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,550
...or "People Persecuted
by Pablo Escobar,"

59
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:56,310
the vigilantes waging war on those
associated with the notorious drug lord.

60
00:07:56,390 --> 00:08:02,560
Mr. President, the media is asking
for a comment on Los Pepes.

61
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,570
It's only a matter of time
before it's made public.

62
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,480
Acknowledgement isn't the same
as condemning.

63
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:12,990
Sooner or later, you'll have to make
an official public statement.

64
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,990
They're doing God's work
as far as I'm concerned.

65
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,710
- That can't be our official position.
- It can be our official position...

66
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,000
Gentlemen!

67
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:31,760
Los Pepes is a vigilante death squad.

68
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,760
We'll take care of them
when the time comes.

69
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:39,100
But for now, let's focus
on our own efforts to catch Escobar.

70
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:43,350
I believe that's proven
a big enough job for all of us.

71
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,280
Our communications department has picked
up conversations in the Manrique district

72
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:53,860
between Jairo, who is one of Escobar's
sicarios, and his mother, who is ill.

73
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,780
We know Jairo is her only child
and likely to visit her.

74
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,620
We'll continue to monitor the frequencies
for further information.

75
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,120
One more thing.

76
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,710
I don't have to tell you that there's
another group now operating in Medellín,

77
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,710
combating Escobar: Los Pepes.

78
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,300
Let me be very clear.

79
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:20,810
There must and will be a clear line
between them and us.

80
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,730
- Understood?
- Yes, Colonel.

81
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:24,480
Dismissed, thank you.

82
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,190
CNP's been busy with wiretaps.

83
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,360
They picked up chatter
from Jairo's mom here... and here.

84
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,290
Search Bloc won't be able to move until
they get corroboration he's in the area.

85
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,460
Which could take days.

86
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:30,880
Even longer... for them to find the house.

87
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:37,130
I think... Jairo is planning a homecoming.

88
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,300
Maybe even today.

89
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:47,060
I'll see what I can find out
on the streets.

90
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,570
- Hello?
- Listen up, Carlos.

91
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:59,820
I have information that Jairo
is going to his mother's.

92
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:22,430
- National Police, can you open up?
- What do you need?

93
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,060
Open up. Hurry. Hurry.

94
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,290
Don't make me kill you
in front of your mother.

95
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,370
Don't touch her!

96
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:45,740
Relax, mother, relax.

97
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,210
Ma'am, if you don't cooperate,
we won't be able to find your son.

98
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:56,130
But I don't know where he is.
I didn't notice anything.

99
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,550
Do you have enemies here
in the neighborhood?

100
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,550
I don't know.
It was my fault that he was here.

101
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,050
He came to see his mother...

102
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,320
IN DEFENSE OF THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE

103
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,210
- What did you ask Santa for?
- A game.

104
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:14,540
- Which one?
- The Joker game.

105
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,630
You think he'll bring it to you?

106
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:17,960
Dad?

107
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,050
Santa is going to bring me
the Joker game, right?

108
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,720
Dad?

109
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,470
Pablo, my love?

110
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:32,140
Of course, Santa will bring you
everything you want, like always.

111
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,230
Christmas without Christ.

112
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:44,570
I'm planning on going to
the advent service tomorrow with the kids.

113
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,910
What? No.
No one should leave this house.

114
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,490
I'm sure the kids would love
to see the lights.

115
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,750
The children are staying here
and so are you.

116
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,080
Remember the first time
you saw the fireworks?

117
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,750
My love, can you tell your mother
she can't take the children to Medellín?

118
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:00,090
Mama, it's best for us to stay here.

119
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:02,260
It's been a month
since I've gone to church.

120
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,340
I'm sure that God
can hear your prayers from here.

121
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,550
Don Pablo.

122
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,850
Boss, they killed three more of our men.

123
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,730
They found Jairo dead next to the river.

124
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,240
Look, it's the Baccarat Crystal.

125
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,280
Thank you.

126
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:32,450
- That's also Baccarat Crystal.
- Feel the weight. Look...

127
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:37,370
You can feel it's Baccarat.
This is from the Lloredas, right?

128
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,880
How's it going, my love?

129
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,800
My love, look at what
the Lloredas brought.

130
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,380
Look, there's two.

131
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,130
The Lloredas always treat us well...

132
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:51,970
NEW DEATH SQUAD IN MEDELLIN
"LOS PEPES"

133
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:58,900
As gratifying as these displays may feel,
I'm not comfortable with these signs.

134
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,320
They invite too much attention
and will lead to questions.

135
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,070
Our objective is to eliminate Escobar
as efficiently and discreetly as possible.

136
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,660
Without a doubt.

137
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,920
No more proclamations or manifestos
or letters to the media.

138
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,170
What about Miami?

139
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,590
We buy time.

140
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:29,340
Let him think he still has control.

141
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,970
Until the moment we take it from him.

142
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,520
- New intel from the embassy.
- Thank you.

143
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,310
- What do you have for me, Peña?
- I got something new.

144
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:25,900
- Blackie.
- I like the way this is going, Javier.

145
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,820
He's got a girlfriend. She's pregnant,
keeps calling. They're vetting it now.

146
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,660
It'll take a while.
Blackie's going to show.

147
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,410
It's done.

148
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:39,890
Almighty Holy Child of Atocha.
Carmelita, help me please.

149
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,470
Don't fight with me anymore.

150
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,060
I'm going to tell you two things:
First, relax.

151
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,060
That's harmful for you and the baby.

152
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,480
Second, for the love of God,
take the money.

153
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:51,900
I'll find more later.

154
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,240
It's not for you or me, it's for the baby,
please understand.

155
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:58,240
Try to understand me.
I don't want your money.

156
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,660
I want you to be with me
and the baby, that's it.

157
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:04,580
Stop being stupid, girl.
We need that money.

158
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,220
- Listen to your dad.
- I don't know what's wrong with this girl.

159
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,130
She's stubborn.

160
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,200
Post three is in position.

161
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:47,790
Yes, sir, we'll be there in five minutes.

162
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:00,050
Wait, Javier.

163
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,570
Talk to me. We're just getting here.

164
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,320
Copy that, we're leaving now.

165
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,740
It was Berna.
The streets are full of Search Bloc.

166
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:25,370
All right, boys, the hunt is over for now.
Let's get out of here.

167
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,170
- What's going on?
- Nothing, sir.

168
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,920
We're conducting a police operation.
All good?

169
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,010
Let him through.

170
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,940
Keep calm, guys.
Hide your weapons while we handle this.

171
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,690
Let him through.

172
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,910
Good evening, what can I do for you?

173
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:06,950
Good afternoon, gentleman.
I need to see some form of ID, please.

174
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,790
Of course, with pleasure.

175
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,460
How's this for an ID?

176
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:26,060
Get out of the car and put your hands
where I can see them.

177
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,100
Quickly.

178
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,730
Boy, come over here.

179
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:36,400
- Colonel. Situation at checkpoint 20.
- What's going on?

180
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,680
- Armed men attempting to pass through.
- Checkpoint 20?

181
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,900
That's correct, sir.

182
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,740
- All units move to position 20.
- Understood.

183
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,990
All units to position 20.

184
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,920
My love, you have to take the money.

185
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:01,840
Blackie! Blackie. The cops are here.

186
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,970
Take care of the baby!
Take care, Carmelita!

187
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:10,480
We're both on the same team here.
What's the problem?

188
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:15,360
Stay where you are!
Hands where I can see them.

189
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:20,280
Relax, relax.

190
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,530
Want to see my ID?

191
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,530
Take it out slowly.

192
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,630
You point a gun at me, motherfucker?

193
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,720
Do me a favor.

194
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:47,550
Move those cars because
we're not playing Cops and Robbers here.

195
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,560
Relax!

196
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,400
Disarm!

197
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,070
- No, you disarm.
- Sir.

198
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:03,320
Lower your firearm.

199
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,740
Easy!

200
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:10,540
Okay, tough guys. Bravo!

201
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,540
Bravo!

202
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:17,170
Bravo, yes, we know it.
We all want Escobar.

203
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,250
But let us do the fucking job.

204
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:24,260
What? You want to kill each other
at a checkpoint?

205
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,930
Lower your weapon. Lower it.

206
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,260
Lower it.

207
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,770
Okay. These dreamers
think they're helping.

208
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,280
- Are you okay? Yeah? Everything okay?
- Yes, sir.

209
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,120
Okay. Let's go home alive.

210
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,030
- Okay?
- Okay.

211
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,450
- Let them pass.
- Okay.

212
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,540
Well then, thank you.

213
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,900
- What happened? Everything okay? Yes?
- Yes, sir.

214
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,110
Miss, we need your cooperation.

215
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,240
Tell us where Blackie is.
Where do we find him?

216
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,990
I told you. I haven't seen him.

217
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,330
Don't be afraid. We don't want you.

218
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:35,160
We want your boyfriend, Blackie.

219
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,830
Sir, I told you,
I don't know where he's at.

220
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,420
That bastard has not come around
in a long time.

221
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,920
If you want, let's go to the station.
But I told you, I don't know where he is.

222
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,670
So please leave my house.

223
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,930
They were eight, maybe ten.

224
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:54,350
How did they take your firearm?

225
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:01,520
I don't know, he just took it. Sorry.

226
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:08,190
Next time, might as well
put the gun to your own head.

227
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,530
It's easier.

228
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:30,610
Mr. President, these men, the Castaños,

229
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:34,030
I've seen their tactics firsthand
in the jungle against the FARC.

230
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:39,040
Their method of war is murder.
I think this is only the beginning.

231
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,700
And it will get even worse.

232
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:44,460
Colonel, I understand your concern.

233
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:48,130
It's strange. They usually operate
against the guerrillas

234
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:51,800
but now they're operating
against the narcos.

235
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,380
Hugo, my cabinet is still evaluating
the best course of action

236
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,140
with regard to Los Pepes.

237
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:03,560
Sir, I'd like your permission
to engage them.

238
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:08,900
No. The greatest service we can do
for this nation is capture Escobar.

239
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:11,320
That's what we must focus on, Colonel.

240
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,490
It's our priority.

241
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:17,070
I understand. Thank you, sir.

242
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:49,020
Let's take a look at this injury.

243
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,650
Very good.

244
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,960
This is going to hurt.
Tell me who you work for.

245
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:10,000
The Castaños.

246
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,050
The Castaños.

247
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:20,720
What could have brought them
out of the jungle?

248
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,890
I say it was money.

249
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:30,190
More money than Judy Moncada can find.

250
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:37,990
Now is not the time
to take on more problems, brother.

251
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,160
The Cali cartel thinks
they're immune to attack.

252
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,580
This can't go unanswered.

253
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,080
Go.

254
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,770
Carlos, you scared me.

255
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:29,540
Tata, you have to do it now.
Pablo's gone mad.

256
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,460
With everything he's planning,
there will be consequences.

257
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:34,630
You and the kids
need to separate from him.

258
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,460
No, Carlos.

259
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:42,130
Tata, my God, listen to me.

260
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:45,140
There's a fearlessness to Los Pepes
that I've never seen.

261
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,220
The public declarations,
the open displays.

262
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,810
They won't stop until he's dead.

263
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:54,770
I know that, Carlos.
I've known for a long time now.

264
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,980
You know what's the only thought
on my mind?

265
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,650
That this is the last time...

266
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:04,740
the last time
I'll look at my husband's face.

267
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:08,080
The last time
I'll feel his arms around me.

268
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,500
The last time I'll see him play
with our children.

269
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:15,080
I automatically push that idea
out of my mind.

270
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,920
And now?

271
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,430
Now I know, Carlos, that wherever I go...

272
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,760
I'll always be Pablo Escobar's wife.

273
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:30,770
My children will always
be Pablo Escobar's children.

274
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:33,940
Even if we lived in exile with him.

275
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,190
But without him?

276
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:40,690
No.

277
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:46,370
Okay.

278
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:48,120
Let's do something.

279
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,290
If we talk to him,
maybe he'll reconsider leaving with us.

280
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:56,790
I've had a good life.

281
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,960
Did you ever imagine we'd have all this?

282
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:22,320
When my niece was growing up,
she didn't think this day would come.

283
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,240
She was so skinny.

284
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:28,820
- She wore glasses and had braces.
- Yes.

285
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:33,040
When she was 12,
she thought her life was over.

286
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:37,500
I told her to wait and be patient.

287
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:42,090
Someday her beauty on the outside
would match her beauty within.

288
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:45,760
You have never looked more beautiful
than you do tonight.

289
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,090
Cheers to the family.

290
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,100
To Marta and Diego! Cheers!

291
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,830
Wait!

292
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,620
Wait!

293
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:20,640
Ma! Papa! Papa!

294
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,020
- I'm here, my love.
- Mom!

295
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,210
That man...

296
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:46,840
has no decency.

297
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,850
To attack my family like this...

298
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,220
my daughter...

299
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,520
on the night of her wedding...

300
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,860
Only a madman would do that.

301
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,240
A crazed animal, dangerous.

302
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:19,500
I want him dead.

303
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,540
Not next year. Right now.

304
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,250
Kill all of them.

305
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:29,920
I don't just want you to kill his lawyers,
accountants and bankers...

306
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:33,050
I want you to kill his secretaries...

307
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:38,930
anyone who lifted a finger
to help that man.

308
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,890
I want to see them dead.

309
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:46,270
Anyone who has ever licked a postage stamp
and put it on an envelope in his name,

310
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,440
I want to see them dead.

311
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:54,450
And then I want you to find anyone who
ever shook his hand and kill them too!

312
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:59,580
That son of a bitch.

313
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:07,630
From this night, we'll show no mercy.

314
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,060
Gilberto?

315
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:23,480
Gilberto, Miguel and Pacho survived, boss.

316
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,890
That'll be all, Quica.

317
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,270
Thank you, boss.

318
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,240
Pablo?

319
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:41,830
I'm worried about Tata.

320
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:45,580
I think you should let her travel.
She'll be safer.

321
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:48,790
What you're doing will have consequences.

322
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,500
That's why they're here. Right?

323
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:55,920
That's why they're here with me,
to be safe.

324
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,840
- Cali is going to want payback for--
- I know...

325
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,350
who my enemies are, Carlos.

326
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,270
And I can fight them all.

327
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:07,600
I know that.

328
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:10,860
But if Tata and the children
are out of the country,

329
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,030
you'd be free to wage this war
with no holds barred.

330
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,990
Let me ask you something.

331
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:31,380
Why are you here?

332
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,840
For Tata.

333
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:35,630
Right?

334
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:40,340
To make her happier.

335
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:46,560
To help her be more comfortable
with the life we're being forced to lead.

336
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,400
Have you done that?

337
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:56,150
Pablo, my sister is terrified.
And you can't see that--

338
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:02,410
Your sister is a lot tougher
than you think.

339
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:08,000
My wife... and my children...

340
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:10,710
stay with me.

341
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:29,430
Hello.

342
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,000
Ma'am?

343
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:40,010
Take me to Mass.

344
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,590
- But the boss said we couldn't.
- Pablo worries too much.

345
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,470
Besides, you work for me.

346
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:57,020
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

347
00:37:57,110 --> 00:38:03,860
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth, as it is in heaven.

348
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:09,450
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses

349
00:38:09,530 --> 00:38:13,500
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

350
00:38:35,190 --> 00:38:41,650
It's shameful for the country to stand by
while a group of mercenaries

351
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:45,900
distributes its version
of perverse justice.

352
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:49,070
It makes all of us look bad.

353
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,330
- Including the president.
- Especially the president.

354
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:57,750
If he continues to allow Los Pepes
to do the dirty work,

355
00:38:57,830 --> 00:38:59,420
which is his responsibility...

356
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,590
Colombia will never forgive him.

357
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:24,230
MERRY CHRISTMAS

358
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:23,520
Where were you?

359
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:26,850
- I went to church.
- I told you it wasn't safe.

360
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:30,360
And I told you that it would be fine.
And look, everything's fine.

361
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,690
How could you put the children's lives
at risk?

362
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:34,860
No one here is in danger.

363
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:39,200
I'm surprised at you, Pablo.
This one has always been nervous, but you?

364
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,950
Don't talk that way to my husband.

365
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:46,620
I can talk to him however I want.
I don't know why everyone is--

366
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:58,220
Take Tata and the kids!
You, cover my mother!

367
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:11,900
Juan Pablo! Juan Pablo!
Put your coat on, quick! Put your coat on.

368
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:14,570
Come here, Manuela. Let's go, Pablo!

369
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:18,360
This way! Run!

370
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:21,410
Run quickly!

371
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:24,660
Pablo!

372
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,500
Get out!

373
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,420
Carlos, let's go!

374
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:34,590
Run, Limón, run!

375
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:36,670
Let's go! Outside!

376
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:40,180
- Come on, Tata, come on.
- Get him in the car. Get him inside!

377
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,760
- Quickly! Let's go!
- Quickly!

378
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:45,180
Give me the girl.

379
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:47,100
Get in, Tata, get in.

380
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,190
Come on, brother. Go! Cover that side!

381
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,440
Move!

382
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:57,840
They're in the house!
Let's go! Let's go!

383
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:03,340
- Calm down.
- Don't let her move.

384
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:05,970
Come on, boss! Let's go.

385
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,470
- No!
- Pablo!

386
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,690
Come on!

387
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:17,860
Boss, come on!

388
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:20,020
Let's go, boss!

389
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,450
Come on!

390
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:26,280
Let's go!

391
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,180
Los Pepes...

392
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:36,770
the Cali cartel, Judy Moncada,

393
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:40,690
the Castaños, the government, the gringos.

394
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:43,530
Let the bastards come.

395
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:47,950
We'll be ready for a war,
a fucking bloodbath.

396
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:52,740
We will fight like we have never
fought before in our lives.

397
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:55,290
Yes, boss.

398
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:58,790
Go for food and you go for firewood.

399
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:07,300
Whoever did this
will never get near us ever again.

400
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:13,720
I promise you.

401
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:25,440
Daddy, how will Santa
know how to find us?

402
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:37,830
Santa...

403
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:46,670
Santa will always find
your good and kind heart.

404
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:51,510
Wherever you are in this world.

405
00:48:51,590 --> 00:48:56,930
Boss? The wood is all wet.
There's no way to light it up.

406
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:10,190
Go to Envigado for food and wood.

407
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:13,700
- Right away, boss.
- Be careful not to be seen.

408
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:14,870
Got it.

409
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:21,790
This is all I could find, boss.

410
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:24,380
How do you open that shit?

411
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,210
I'll go look, boss.

412
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:44,730
This just came in.

413
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:52,070
Shit's getting real, Peña.

414
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,790
Mommy, I'm cold.

415
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:54,220
She's freezing.

416
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:02,220
Put this on.

417
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:42,010
You and the children...
need to leave Colombia.

418
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:50,690
When you're safe,
I'll be free to do what's best for us.

419
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:01,950
It won't be long.

420
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:08,210
Soon we'll be together again.

421
00:52:12,710 --> 00:52:14,210
Forever.
