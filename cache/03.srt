1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
My name is Barry Allen,

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
and I am the fastest man alive.

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
To the outside world, I'm
an ordinary forensic scientist,

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

7
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,

8
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

9
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I fight crime and find
other meta-humans like me.

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

11
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
After defeating Zoom
and saving the multiverse,

12
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

13
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I ran back in time and created

14
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

15
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
the alternate timeline, Flashpoint.

16
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

17
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I restored the timeline to how it was,

18
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

19
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
only to find things
weren't as I left them.

20
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

21
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
I brought new threats to our world,

22
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

23
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
and I'm the only one fast
enough to stop them.

24
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,-010
&nbsp

25
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,638
I am The Flash.

26
00:00:00,648 --> 00:00:01,256
&nbsp

27
00:00:01,266 --> 00:00:02,987
Previously on “The Flash”...

28
00:00:02,997 --> 00:00:02,989
&nbsp

29
00:00:02,999 --> 00:00:05,698
I got hit with the dark matter.
It must have affected me somehow.

30
00:00:05,708 --> 00:00:05,708
&nbsp

31
00:00:05,718 --> 00:00:07,107
We're going home.

32
00:00:07,117 --> 00:00:07,109
&nbsp

33
00:00:07,119 --> 00:00:09,910
I went back in time and
created an alternate timeline.

34
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:09,912
&nbsp

35
00:00:09,922 --> 00:00:11,211
- Wally?
- Aah.

36
00:00:11,221 --> 00:00:11,213
&nbsp

37
00:00:11,223 --> 00:00:12,313
Wally? Can you hear me?

38
00:00:12,323 --> 00:00:12,315
&nbsp

39
00:00:12,325 --> 00:00:13,814
My name is Edward Clariss.

40
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:13,816
&nbsp

41
00:00:13,826 --> 00:00:15,342
Rivals should know each other's names.

42
00:00:15,352 --> 00:00:15,352
&nbsp

43
00:00:15,362 --> 00:00:16,851
When I came back,
things weren't the same.

44
00:00:16,861 --> 00:00:16,853
&nbsp

45
00:00:16,863 --> 00:00:20,422
I don't trust you, and I don't
like things that I don't trust.

46
00:00:20,432 --> 00:00:20,424
&nbsp

47
00:00:20,434 --> 00:00:22,524
You'll always be Barry,
and I'll always be Iris.

48
00:00:22,534 --> 00:00:22,526
&nbsp

49
00:00:22,536 --> 00:00:23,958
And we always find each other.

50
00:00:23,968 --> 00:00:25,195
&nbsp

51
00:00:25,205 --> 00:00:27,896
- Who are you?
- I am Alchemy.

52
00:00:27,906 --> 00:00:27,898
&nbsp

53
00:00:27,908 --> 00:00:30,899
- Alchemy!
- You failed, Clariss.

54
00:00:30,909 --> 00:00:38,514
&nbsp

55
00:00:38,524 --> 00:00:39,845
Remember that feeling you got as a kid

56
00:00:39,855 --> 00:00:39,855
&nbsp

57
00:00:39,865 --> 00:00:41,488
when you were so excited about something

58
00:00:41,498 --> 00:00:41,490
&nbsp

59
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,390
that you couldn't focus
on anything else?

60
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:43,392
&nbsp

61
00:00:43,402 --> 00:00:45,726
That's me right now, thinking about...

62
00:00:45,736 --> 00:00:45,728
&nbsp

63
00:00:45,738 --> 00:00:48,829
well, what I always think about.

64
00:00:48,839 --> 00:00:48,831
&nbsp

65
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:51,765
Allen! Enough with the knee.

66
00:00:51,775 --> 00:00:54,837
&nbsp

67
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:57,649
- Where are you going?
- I'm going on a date.

68
00:00:57,659 --> 00:00:57,659
&nbsp

69
00:00:57,669 --> 00:00:59,673
Well, not yet, you're not.

70
00:00:59,683 --> 00:00:59,675
&nbsp

71
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:02,442
You know, you're not
actually my boss, Julian.

72
00:01:02,452 --> 00:01:02,444
&nbsp

73
00:01:02,454 --> 00:01:05,279
But I am the senior lab tech,
and the last time I checked,

74
00:01:05,289 --> 00:01:05,281
&nbsp

75
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:08,382
the hours were 10:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.

76
00:01:08,392 --> 00:01:08,384
&nbsp

77
00:01:08,394 --> 00:01:11,385
Not 6:58. Not 6:59.

78
00:01:11,395 --> 00:01:11,387
&nbsp

79
00:01:11,397 --> 00:01:13,553
But se...

80
00:01:13,563 --> 00:01:15,291
&nbsp

81
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:16,857
Remember that other feeling you got

82
00:01:16,867 --> 00:01:16,859
&nbsp

83
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:18,225
when that thing you were excited about

84
00:01:18,235 --> 00:01:18,227
&nbsp

85
00:01:18,237 --> 00:01:20,961
seemed to take forever to arrive?

86
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:20,963
&nbsp

87
00:01:20,973 --> 00:01:22,963
Imagine being a speedster.

88
00:01:22,973 --> 00:01:22,965
&nbsp

89
00:01:22,975 --> 00:01:25,172
Days seem like weeks.
Hours seem like days.

90
00:01:25,182 --> 00:01:25,182
&nbsp

91
00:01:25,192 --> 00:01:29,325
And seconds seem like...
you get the point.

92
00:01:29,335 --> 00:01:29,413
&nbsp

93
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:30,971
Ven.

94
00:01:30,981 --> 00:01:34,051
&nbsp

95
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:35,542
I'll see you tomorrow.

96
00:01:35,552 --> 00:01:55,764
&nbsp

97
00:01:55,774 --> 00:01:57,331
It's too much? Yeah, it's too much.

98
00:01:57,341 --> 00:01:57,333
&nbsp

99
00:01:57,343 --> 00:01:58,444
It's the heart, right?

100
00:01:58,454 --> 00:01:58,454
&nbsp

101
00:01:58,464 --> 00:02:00,667
It's too cheesy? Hold on.

102
00:02:00,677 --> 00:02:02,326
&nbsp

103
00:02:02,336 --> 00:02:04,705
Is that better? That's...

104
00:02:04,715 --> 00:02:04,707
&nbsp

105
00:02:04,717 --> 00:02:06,873
That's worse?
We'll go back to the heart.

106
00:02:06,883 --> 00:02:06,883
&nbsp

107
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:08,075
No, Bare. Wait, wait, wait.

108
00:02:08,085 --> 00:02:08,077
&nbsp

109
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:09,643
It is so beautiful,

110
00:02:09,653 --> 00:02:09,645
&nbsp

111
00:02:09,655 --> 00:02:11,559
and you are so sweet,

112
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:11,569
&nbsp

113
00:02:11,579 --> 00:02:15,022
but tonight, I want to be with you.

114
00:02:15,032 --> 00:02:15,032
&nbsp

115
00:02:15,042 --> 00:02:16,565
Barry Allen. Not the Flash.

116
00:02:16,575 --> 00:02:16,567
&nbsp

117
00:02:16,577 --> 00:02:18,066
So...

118
00:02:18,076 --> 00:02:18,068
&nbsp

119
00:02:18,078 --> 00:02:20,001
So no Flash talk.

120
00:02:20,011 --> 00:02:20,003
&nbsp

121
00:02:20,013 --> 00:02:21,570
No speed.

122
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,006
&nbsp

123
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:23,638
No problem.

124
00:02:23,648 --> 00:02:23,640
&nbsp

125
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:24,639
All right.

126
00:02:24,649 --> 00:02:24,641
&nbsp

127
00:02:24,651 --> 00:02:26,007
Starting now,

128
00:02:26,017 --> 00:02:26,009
&nbsp

129
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:28,610
the Flash is officially off-limits.

130
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,180
&nbsp

131
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,680
So, wow...

132
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:31,682
&nbsp

133
00:02:31,692 --> 00:02:33,348
Mm.

134
00:02:33,358 --> 00:02:33,350
&nbsp

135
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,150
Where are we going?

136
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:35,152
&nbsp

137
00:02:35,162 --> 00:02:37,385
It's a surprise.

138
00:02:37,395 --> 00:02:40,206

&nbsp

141
00:02:48,909 --> 00:02:50,999
Are you planning on donating a kidney

142
00:02:51,009 --> 00:02:51,001
&nbsp

143
00:02:51,011 --> 00:02:53,068
sometime in the near future or...?

144
00:02:53,078 --> 00:02:53,070
&nbsp

145
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,936
A kidney?

146
00:02:54,946 --> 00:02:54,938
&nbsp

147
00:02:54,948 --> 00:02:56,705
This place is...

148
00:02:56,715 --> 00:02:56,707
&nbsp

149
00:02:56,717 --> 00:02:58,773
Oh, don't look at the prices.

150
00:02:58,783 --> 00:02:58,775
&nbsp

151
00:02:58,785 --> 00:03:01,610
Just get whatever you want.

152
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,648
&nbsp

153
00:03:05,658 --> 00:03:07,182
So...

154
00:03:07,192 --> 00:03:08,529
&nbsp

155
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:10,785
Yeah, so...

156
00:03:10,795 --> 00:03:12,723
&nbsp

157
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:13,955
How was work?

158
00:03:13,965 --> 00:03:13,957
&nbsp

159
00:03:13,967 --> 00:03:18,449
Yeah, super busy. How about you?

160
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:18,766
&nbsp

161
00:03:18,776 --> 00:03:23,365
Well, Julian had me write
up a carbon dating report.

162
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:23,367
&nbsp

163
00:03:23,377 --> 00:03:25,400
Then a DNA sequencing report.

164
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:25,402
&nbsp

165
00:03:25,412 --> 00:03:27,569
A couple chemical compound reports.

166
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:27,571
&nbsp

167
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:29,571
So he pretty much just
gives me all the work

168
00:03:29,581 --> 00:03:29,573
&nbsp

169
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,006
he doesn't want me to do, so...

170
00:03:31,016 --> 00:03:31,008
&nbsp

171
00:03:31,018 --> 00:03:32,274
Yeah, I know, it's really boring.

172
00:03:32,284 --> 00:03:32,276
&nbsp

173
00:03:32,286 --> 00:03:33,742
No, no. Oh, I'm so sorry, Barry.

174
00:03:33,752 --> 00:03:33,744
&nbsp

175
00:03:33,754 --> 00:03:35,710
I'm just... It's been a really long day.

176
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:35,712
&nbsp

177
00:03:35,722 --> 00:03:38,146
Yeah, I know. Me too.

178
00:03:38,156 --> 00:03:40,739
&nbsp

179
00:03:40,749 --> 00:03:41,866
What's going on?

180
00:03:41,876 --> 00:03:41,876
&nbsp

181
00:03:41,886 --> 00:03:45,553
Apparently, a robbery's in progress
across the street. Excuse me.

182
00:03:45,563 --> 00:03:48,125
&nbsp

183
00:03:48,135 --> 00:03:49,591
Go, go, go.

184
00:03:49,601 --> 00:03:49,593
&nbsp

185
00:03:49,603 --> 00:03:50,885
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

186
00:03:50,895 --> 00:03:50,895
&nbsp

187
00:03:50,905 --> 00:03:52,861
Yeah, use your speed. Go.

188
00:03:52,871 --> 00:03:52,863
&nbsp

189
00:03:52,873 --> 00:03:53,995
Okay.

190
00:03:54,005 --> 00:04:00,531
&nbsp

191
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:03,004
- Uh, where were we?
- Um...

192
00:04:03,014 --> 00:04:05,075
&nbsp

193
00:04:05,085 --> 00:04:06,474
Cisco.

194
00:04:06,484 --> 00:04:07,711
&nbsp

195
00:04:07,721 --> 00:04:09,844
We should go.

196
00:04:09,854 --> 00:04:09,846
&nbsp

197
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,246
Yeah.

198
00:04:11,256 --> 00:04:15,886
&nbsp

199
00:04:15,896 --> 00:04:17,382
- What's going on?
- That.

200
00:04:17,392 --> 00:04:17,392
&nbsp

201
00:04:17,402 --> 00:04:18,720
Yeah, why'd you open a breach?

202
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:18,722
&nbsp

203
00:04:18,732 --> 00:04:20,155
- I didn't.
- What?

204
00:04:20,165 --> 00:04:20,157
&nbsp

205
00:04:20,167 --> 00:04:21,589
That's why we called you.

206
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:21,591
&nbsp

207
00:04:21,601 --> 00:04:23,525
- Well, can you close it?
- Once again,

208
00:04:23,535 --> 00:04:23,527
&nbsp

209
00:04:23,537 --> 00:04:24,826
wouldn't have called if I could.

210
00:04:24,836 --> 00:04:26,396
&nbsp

211
00:04:26,406 --> 00:04:29,364
- Somebody's coming through.
- Get back.

212
00:04:29,374 --> 00:04:35,172
&nbsp

213
00:04:35,182 --> 00:04:36,805
Allen.

214
00:04:36,815 --> 00:04:36,807
&nbsp

215
00:04:36,817 --> 00:04:38,106
Wells.

216
00:04:38,116 --> 00:04:38,108
&nbsp

217
00:04:38,118 --> 00:04:39,474
I need your help.

218
00:04:39,484 --> 00:04:39,476
&nbsp

219
00:04:39,486 --> 00:04:41,076
With what?

220
00:04:41,086 --> 00:04:45,182
&nbsp

221
00:04:45,192 --> 00:04:47,415
- With that.
- Hey, guys.

222
00:04:47,425 --> 00:04:47,417
&nbsp

223
00:04:47,427 --> 00:04:49,718
Jesse. You're a speedster?

224
00:04:49,728 --> 00:04:49,720
&nbsp

225
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:52,253
Yeah. It's pretty cool, right?

226
00:04:52,263 --> 00:04:52,255
&nbsp

227
00:04:52,265 --> 00:04:55,056
I mean, yeah, I would say so.

228
00:04:55,066 --> 00:04:55,058
&nbsp

229
00:04:55,068 --> 00:04:56,791
When did this happen?

230
00:04:56,801 --> 00:04:56,793
&nbsp

231
00:04:56,803 --> 00:04:58,626
A few days ago.

232
00:04:58,636 --> 00:04:58,628
&nbsp

233
00:04:58,638 --> 00:05:00,595
So, when I got Allen his speed back,

234
00:05:00,605 --> 00:05:00,597
&nbsp

235
00:05:00,607 --> 00:05:02,263
Wally and Jesse were hit
with the dark matter.

236
00:05:02,273 --> 00:05:02,265
&nbsp

237
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:04,165
Turns out she was affected.
She was totally affected.

238
00:05:04,175 --> 00:05:04,167
&nbsp

239
00:05:04,177 --> 00:05:05,567
But I didn't get speed,

240
00:05:05,577 --> 00:05:05,569
&nbsp

241
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:07,435
so could it have been
from something else?

242
00:05:07,445 --> 00:05:07,437
&nbsp

243
00:05:07,447 --> 00:05:09,371
No... I mean, I doubt it.

244
00:05:09,381 --> 00:05:09,373
&nbsp

245
00:05:09,383 --> 00:05:10,739
Dark matter affects different people

246
00:05:10,749 --> 00:05:10,741
&nbsp

247
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:12,040
in different ways at different times...

248
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:12,042
&nbsp

249
00:05:12,052 --> 00:05:13,608
Sometimes not at all, so be thankful,

250
00:05:13,618 --> 00:05:13,610
&nbsp

251
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,210
but she was affected,
and I want to run some tests

252
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:15,212
&nbsp

253
00:05:15,222 --> 00:05:16,711
and find out just how much.

254
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:16,713
&nbsp

255
00:05:16,723 --> 00:05:18,513
Well, then, you've come
to the right place.

256
00:05:18,523 --> 00:05:18,515
&nbsp

257
00:05:18,525 --> 00:05:20,115
Let's go to the Speed Lab.

258
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:20,117
&nbsp

259
00:05:20,127 --> 00:05:21,616
Speed Lab?

260
00:05:21,626 --> 00:05:22,686
&nbsp

261
00:05:22,696 --> 00:05:24,619
This is insane.

262
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:24,621
&nbsp

263
00:05:24,631 --> 00:05:25,887
Something tells me you've never been

264
00:05:25,897 --> 00:05:25,889
&nbsp

265
00:05:25,899 --> 00:05:27,188
in this room before.

266
00:05:27,198 --> 00:05:27,190
&nbsp

267
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,423
Nope.

268
00:05:28,433 --> 00:05:28,425
&nbsp

269
00:05:28,435 --> 00:05:30,525
Wait, you... You nev...

270
00:05:30,535 --> 00:05:30,527
&nbsp

271
00:05:30,537 --> 00:05:32,627
Allen.

272
00:05:32,637 --> 00:05:32,629
&nbsp

273
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,096
I suppose that means you
traveled back in time again.

274
00:05:35,106 --> 00:05:35,098
&nbsp

275
00:05:35,108 --> 00:05:36,282
Yeah, but...

276
00:05:36,292 --> 00:05:36,292
&nbsp

277
00:05:36,302 --> 00:05:37,665
How many times did I
tell you not to do that?

278
00:05:37,675 --> 00:05:37,675
&nbsp

279
00:05:37,685 --> 00:05:39,501
You figured that out
pretty quickly, Harry.

280
00:05:39,511 --> 00:05:39,503
&nbsp

281
00:05:39,513 --> 00:05:40,902
Yes, Ms. West, it was easy

282
00:05:40,912 --> 00:05:40,904
&nbsp

283
00:05:40,914 --> 00:05:43,405
because we've never been here either.

284
00:05:43,415 --> 00:05:43,407
&nbsp

285
00:05:43,417 --> 00:05:44,873
- Nope.
- Right.

286
00:05:44,883 --> 00:05:44,875
&nbsp

287
00:05:44,885 --> 00:05:46,241
Other Earths, other timelines.

288
00:05:46,251 --> 00:05:46,243
&nbsp

289
00:05:46,253 --> 00:05:47,342
Yes, exactly.

290
00:05:47,352 --> 00:05:47,344
&nbsp

291
00:05:47,354 --> 00:05:49,377
So when did you do it?
After we returned to Earth-2?

292
00:05:49,387 --> 00:05:49,379
&nbsp

293
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:50,812
Look, Harry,

294
00:05:50,822 --> 00:05:50,814
&nbsp

295
00:05:50,824 --> 00:05:53,348
only a couple things are different.

296
00:05:53,358 --> 00:05:53,350
&nbsp

297
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,417
Oh, I'm sure. Not.

298
00:05:55,427 --> 00:05:55,419
&nbsp

299
00:05:55,429 --> 00:05:56,618
Really?

300
00:05:56,628 --> 00:05:56,620
&nbsp

301
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,214
You guys are doing “not” on Earth-2 now?

302
00:05:58,224 --> 00:05:58,224
&nbsp

303
00:05:58,234 --> 00:06:00,922
Uh, no. That's all him.

304
00:06:00,932 --> 00:06:00,924
&nbsp

305
00:06:00,934 --> 00:06:03,224
Okay, let's just get Jesse on the track

306
00:06:03,234 --> 00:06:03,226
&nbsp

307
00:06:03,236 --> 00:06:04,526
and see what she can do.

308
00:06:04,536 --> 00:06:04,528
&nbsp

309
00:06:04,538 --> 00:06:06,060
Yeah, let's do it.

310
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:06,062
&nbsp

311
00:06:06,072 --> 00:06:08,963
All right. Check this out.

312
00:06:08,973 --> 00:06:15,205
&nbsp

313
00:06:15,215 --> 00:06:16,471
Damn.

314
00:06:16,481 --> 00:06:16,473
&nbsp

315
00:06:16,483 --> 00:06:18,440
She really can move.

316
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:18,442
&nbsp

317
00:06:18,452 --> 00:06:20,575
Yeah, she can.

318
00:06:20,585 --> 00:06:20,577
&nbsp

319
00:06:20,587 --> 00:06:23,178
Um... I got to go.

320
00:06:23,188 --> 00:06:24,347
&nbsp

321
00:06:24,357 --> 00:06:25,680
Wally.

322
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:25,682
&nbsp

323
00:06:25,692 --> 00:06:27,916
Oh, man.

324
00:06:27,926 --> 00:06:27,918
&nbsp

325
00:06:27,928 --> 00:06:29,451
I'll talk to him.

326
00:06:29,461 --> 00:06:31,154
&nbsp

327
00:06:31,164 --> 00:06:33,154
Hey, Joe.

328
00:06:33,164 --> 00:06:33,156
&nbsp

329
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:35,323
Um...

330
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:35,325
&nbsp

331
00:06:35,335 --> 00:06:36,825
Look, it's just...

332
00:06:36,835 --> 00:06:36,827
&nbsp

333
00:06:36,837 --> 00:06:39,093
it is better if he doesn't have speed.

334
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,095
&nbsp

335
00:06:39,105 --> 00:06:40,762
Oh, you don't have to
convince me of that.

336
00:06:40,772 --> 00:06:40,764
&nbsp

337
00:06:40,774 --> 00:06:42,797
The last thing I want is two of my kids

338
00:06:42,807 --> 00:06:42,799
&nbsp

339
00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:44,666
zipping around the city,
running into danger.

340
00:06:44,676 --> 00:06:44,668
&nbsp

341
00:06:44,678 --> 00:06:48,236
'Cause he looked pretty disappointed.

342
00:06:48,246 --> 00:06:48,238
&nbsp

343
00:06:48,248 --> 00:06:50,738
This is about that other
timeline, isn't it?

344
00:06:50,748 --> 00:06:50,740
&nbsp

345
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,006
No, I just...

346
00:06:52,016 --> 00:06:52,008
&nbsp

347
00:06:52,018 --> 00:06:54,175
I think you should keep an eye out.

348
00:06:54,185 --> 00:07:07,557
&nbsp

349
00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:10,992
- Where's dinner?
- It's almost ready, John.

350
00:07:11,002 --> 00:07:12,696
&nbsp

351
00:07:12,706 --> 00:07:15,129
I work hard every day to
provide for this family,

352
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:15,131
&nbsp

353
00:07:15,141 --> 00:07:16,498
and this is what greets me?

354
00:07:16,508 --> 00:07:16,500
&nbsp

355
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,799
An empty table?

356
00:07:17,809 --> 00:07:17,801
&nbsp

357
00:07:17,811 --> 00:07:20,802
- Just five more minutes.
- I'm hungry now!

358
00:07:20,812 --> 00:07:20,804
&nbsp

359
00:07:20,814 --> 00:07:22,637
And you speak when
you're spoken to, girl.

360
00:07:22,647 --> 00:07:22,639
&nbsp

361
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:24,005
You understand me?

362
00:07:24,015 --> 00:07:24,402
&nbsp

363
00:07:24,412 --> 00:07:26,140
I saved you from the orphanage

364
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:26,142
&nbsp

365
00:07:26,152 --> 00:07:28,776
and I provide for you every day,

366
00:07:28,786 --> 00:07:28,778
&nbsp

367
00:07:28,788 --> 00:07:31,513
so keep your mouth shut,
Frankie, you got it?

368
00:07:31,523 --> 00:07:43,326
&nbsp

369
00:07:43,336 --> 00:07:47,228
Sorry, John. Frankie's gone.

370
00:07:47,238 --> 00:07:59,114
&nbsp

371
00:07:59,124 --> 00:08:00,052
Hey!

372
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:00,054
&nbsp

373
00:08:00,064 --> 00:08:01,907
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

374
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:01,917
&nbsp

375
00:08:01,927 --> 00:08:03,543
I was trying to get some information

376
00:08:03,553 --> 00:08:03,553
&nbsp

377
00:08:03,563 --> 00:08:06,320
about the man who was attacked
by a lamppost last night.

378
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:06,322
&nbsp

379
00:08:06,332 --> 00:08:07,555
Hey...

380
00:08:07,565 --> 00:08:07,557
&nbsp

381
00:08:07,567 --> 00:08:09,023
Just come here for a second.

382
00:08:09,033 --> 00:08:09,025
&nbsp

383
00:08:09,035 --> 00:08:11,425
So, last night.

384
00:08:11,435 --> 00:08:11,427
&nbsp

385
00:08:11,437 --> 00:08:15,229
I know our first date
didn't shatter any records.

386
00:08:15,239 --> 00:08:15,231
&nbsp

387
00:08:15,241 --> 00:08:16,931
I mean, it wasn't that bad.

388
00:08:16,941 --> 00:08:16,933
&nbsp

389
00:08:16,943 --> 00:08:18,532
- It was...
- Okay, yeah.

390
00:08:18,542 --> 00:08:18,534
&nbsp

391
00:08:18,544 --> 00:08:19,733
It wasn't that great, either.

392
00:08:19,743 --> 00:08:19,735
&nbsp

393
00:08:19,745 --> 00:08:21,836
- It was just kind of...
- Boring?

394
00:08:21,846 --> 00:08:21,838
&nbsp

395
00:08:21,848 --> 00:08:23,337
Boring, yeah.

396
00:08:23,347 --> 00:08:23,339
&nbsp

397
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:26,474
Which feels like my fault.
Maybe I'm boring without my powers.

398
00:08:26,484 --> 00:08:26,476
&nbsp

399
00:08:26,486 --> 00:08:28,642
No, Barry, you are perfect
without your powers.

400
00:08:28,652 --> 00:08:28,644
&nbsp

401
00:08:28,654 --> 00:08:31,412
That's nice, but I mean,
what do you think it is, then?

402
00:08:31,422 --> 00:08:31,414
&nbsp

403
00:08:31,424 --> 00:08:34,215
You don't think it's a
sign that we shouldn't...

404
00:08:34,225 --> 00:08:34,217
&nbsp

405
00:08:34,227 --> 00:08:35,616
No!

406
00:08:35,626 --> 00:08:35,618
&nbsp

407
00:08:35,628 --> 00:08:37,751
No.

408
00:08:37,761 --> 00:08:37,753
&nbsp

409
00:08:37,763 --> 00:08:39,920
Good, I mean, 'cause I do...
I want to try this again,

410
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:39,922
&nbsp

411
00:08:39,932 --> 00:08:41,322
as soon as possible,

412
00:08:41,332 --> 00:08:41,324
&nbsp

413
00:08:41,334 --> 00:08:42,857
but just with everything
that's going on...

414
00:08:42,867 --> 00:08:42,859
&nbsp

415
00:08:42,869 --> 00:08:45,059
This new case, and Wells
and Jesse showing up...

416
00:08:45,069 --> 00:08:45,061
&nbsp

417
00:08:45,071 --> 00:08:46,508
Yeah. No, Barry.

418
00:08:46,518 --> 00:08:46,518
&nbsp

419
00:08:46,528 --> 00:08:47,796
I totally get it. I get it.

420
00:08:47,806 --> 00:08:47,806
&nbsp

421
00:08:47,816 --> 00:08:48,862
I should probably concentrate

422
00:08:48,872 --> 00:08:48,864
&nbsp

423
00:08:48,874 --> 00:08:50,964
on making my deadlines anyway, so.

424
00:08:50,974 --> 00:08:51,324
&nbsp

425
00:08:51,334 --> 00:08:52,565
Cool.

426
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:53,602
&nbsp

427
00:08:53,612 --> 00:08:55,034
- Okay.
- All right.

428
00:08:55,044 --> 00:08:55,036
&nbsp

429
00:08:55,046 --> 00:08:56,436
All right, well, I'm gonna... Okay.

430
00:08:56,446 --> 00:08:56,438
&nbsp

431
00:08:56,448 --> 00:08:57,403
- Yeah.
- Work.

432
00:08:57,413 --> 00:08:57,405
&nbsp

433
00:08:57,415 --> 00:08:59,138
Yeah. Work. Cool.

434
00:08:59,148 --> 00:08:59,140
&nbsp

435
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,374
Yeah. All right. I'll see you later.

436
00:09:01,384 --> 00:09:01,376
&nbsp

437
00:09:01,386 --> 00:09:02,542
- Oh.
- No, I was...

438
00:09:02,552 --> 00:09:02,544
&nbsp

439
00:09:02,554 --> 00:09:03,877
- Yeah, of course.
- Yeah.

440
00:09:03,887 --> 00:09:03,879
&nbsp

441
00:09:03,889 --> 00:09:05,445
- Okay.
- Yeah. All right.

442
00:09:05,455 --> 00:09:05,447
&nbsp

443
00:09:05,457 --> 00:09:08,648
So this says you were in the
room when your father...

444
00:09:08,658 --> 00:09:08,650
&nbsp

445
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,717
Foster father. John.

446
00:09:10,727 --> 00:09:10,719
&nbsp

447
00:09:10,729 --> 00:09:12,752
Right. Foster father.

448
00:09:12,762 --> 00:09:12,754
&nbsp

449
00:09:12,764 --> 00:09:15,840
You were in the room when he was
struck by the street lamppost

450
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:15,850
&nbsp

451
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,490
that flew into the apartment?

452
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,326
&nbsp

453
00:09:18,336 --> 00:09:19,592
Yeah.

454
00:09:19,602 --> 00:09:19,594
&nbsp

455
00:09:19,604 --> 00:09:22,595
But I don't remember any of that.

456
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:24,866
&nbsp

457
00:09:24,876 --> 00:09:26,196
He came home

458
00:09:26,206 --> 00:09:26,206
&nbsp

459
00:09:26,216 --> 00:09:30,542
and yelled at Karen, my foster mom,

460
00:09:30,552 --> 00:09:30,544
&nbsp

461
00:09:30,554 --> 00:09:31,843
to get him dinner.

462
00:09:31,853 --> 00:09:31,845
&nbsp

463
00:09:31,855 --> 00:09:33,745
Mm.

464
00:09:33,755 --> 00:09:33,747
&nbsp

465
00:09:33,757 --> 00:09:37,015
Is that when you blacked out?

466
00:09:37,025 --> 00:09:37,017
&nbsp

467
00:09:37,027 --> 00:09:38,717
Yeah, I think so.

468
00:09:38,727 --> 00:09:38,719
&nbsp

469
00:09:38,729 --> 00:09:40,051
Has that happened before?

470
00:09:40,061 --> 00:09:40,053
&nbsp

471
00:09:40,063 --> 00:09:42,154
You blacking out?

472
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,525
&nbsp

473
00:09:44,535 --> 00:09:46,124
Is John gonna be okay?

474
00:09:46,134 --> 00:09:47,794
&nbsp

475
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:49,794
He's in Central City Hospital.

476
00:09:49,804 --> 00:09:49,796
&nbsp

477
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:50,762
I...

478
00:09:50,772 --> 00:09:50,764
&nbsp

479
00:09:50,774 --> 00:09:52,831
He's pretty banged up.

480
00:09:52,841 --> 00:09:54,301
&nbsp

481
00:09:54,311 --> 00:09:55,767
Frankie, can you excuse me for a second?

482
00:09:55,777 --> 00:09:55,769
&nbsp

483
00:09:55,779 --> 00:09:58,203
- Yeah, of course.
- Thank you.

484
00:09:58,213 --> 00:09:58,205
&nbsp

485
00:09:58,215 --> 00:09:59,704
- Bare.
- Yeah?

486
00:09:59,714 --> 00:09:59,706
&nbsp

487
00:09:59,716 --> 00:10:01,673
- What'd you find out?
- Okay, get this.

488
00:10:01,683 --> 00:10:01,675
&nbsp

489
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:04,309
So, the outer layer of the lamppost

490
00:10:04,319 --> 00:10:04,311
&nbsp

491
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:05,710
is a half an inch thick,

492
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:05,712
&nbsp

493
00:10:05,722 --> 00:10:07,779
but to bend even a quarter-inch of steel

494
00:10:07,789 --> 00:10:07,781
&nbsp

495
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:11,616
requires 177 tons of
tensile strength, so...

496
00:10:11,626 --> 00:10:11,618
&nbsp

497
00:10:11,628 --> 00:10:13,718
So we're looking for a
meta with superstrength?

498
00:10:13,728 --> 00:10:13,720
&nbsp

499
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,554
Well, I'm not sure yet,

500
00:10:15,564 --> 00:10:15,556
&nbsp

501
00:10:15,566 --> 00:10:17,155
but that's as much as I could find.

502
00:10:17,165 --> 00:10:17,157
&nbsp

503
00:10:17,167 --> 00:10:18,323
What? Why?

504
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:18,325
&nbsp

505
00:10:18,335 --> 00:10:20,492
- Because I showed up.
- Yeah.

506
00:10:20,502 --> 00:10:20,494
&nbsp

507
00:10:20,504 --> 00:10:22,494
Yes, the only problem with
Barry's little theory

508
00:10:22,504 --> 00:10:22,496
&nbsp

509
00:10:22,506 --> 00:10:24,596
is there were no fingerprints
found on the post.

510
00:10:24,606 --> 00:10:24,598
&nbsp

511
00:10:24,608 --> 00:10:26,131
Again, Julian, not my theory,

512
00:10:26,141 --> 00:10:26,133
&nbsp

513
00:10:26,143 --> 00:10:28,099
and the meta could've
been wearing gloves.

514
00:10:28,109 --> 00:10:28,101
&nbsp

515
00:10:28,111 --> 00:10:29,568
Yes, perhaps.

516
00:10:29,578 --> 00:10:29,570
&nbsp

517
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,102
But the curvature on the post suggests

518
00:10:31,112 --> 00:10:31,104
&nbsp

519
00:10:31,114 --> 00:10:32,804
that equal amounts of
pressure were applied

520
00:10:32,814 --> 00:10:32,806
&nbsp

521
00:10:32,816 --> 00:10:35,740
to the whole thing at the same time.

522
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:35,742
&nbsp

523
00:10:35,752 --> 00:10:39,477
So, unless our strong man has
a wingspan of over 20 feet...

524
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:39,479
&nbsp

525
00:10:39,489 --> 00:10:41,079
Something else caused it.

526
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:41,081
&nbsp

527
00:10:41,091 --> 00:10:42,414
Yes.

528
00:10:42,424 --> 00:10:44,484
&nbsp

529
00:10:44,494 --> 00:10:46,451
Who's that, sir?

530
00:10:46,461 --> 00:10:46,453
&nbsp

531
00:10:46,463 --> 00:10:50,255
That's Frankie Kane,
the victim's foster kid.

532
00:10:50,265 --> 00:10:50,257
&nbsp

533
00:10:50,267 --> 00:10:52,924
That poor girl's been in
and out of homes for years.

534
00:10:52,934 --> 00:10:52,926
&nbsp

535
00:10:52,936 --> 00:10:56,528
Listen, she said that she blacked out

536
00:10:56,538 --> 00:10:56,530
&nbsp

537
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,629
during the incident.

538
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:57,631
&nbsp

539
00:10:57,641 --> 00:10:59,431
- Blacked out?
- Yeah.

540
00:10:59,441 --> 00:10:59,433
&nbsp

541
00:10:59,443 --> 00:11:02,033
Repressing memories
is a coping mechanism

542
00:11:02,043 --> 00:11:02,035
&nbsp

543
00:11:02,045 --> 00:11:03,903
for lots of foster kids.

544
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:03,913
&nbsp

545
00:11:03,923 --> 00:11:05,937
Hmm. Is it?

546
00:11:05,947 --> 00:11:05,939
&nbsp

547
00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:07,739
It is.

548
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:07,741
&nbsp

549
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:09,574
It could be something else.

550
00:11:09,584 --> 00:11:09,576
&nbsp

551
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:10,842
- What are you...
- What...

552
00:11:10,852 --> 00:11:11,979
&nbsp

553
00:11:11,989 --> 00:11:13,144
Hello there.

554
00:11:13,154 --> 00:11:13,146
&nbsp

555
00:11:13,156 --> 00:11:14,346
Hi.

556
00:11:14,356 --> 00:11:14,348
&nbsp

557
00:11:14,358 --> 00:11:16,114
You okay?

558
00:11:16,124 --> 00:11:16,116
&nbsp

559
00:11:16,126 --> 00:11:17,949
Yeah.

560
00:11:17,959 --> 00:11:17,951
&nbsp

561
00:11:17,961 --> 00:11:20,352
Can I get you some more water?

562
00:11:20,362 --> 00:11:20,354
&nbsp

563
00:11:20,364 --> 00:11:22,254
Yes, thank you.

564
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:22,256
&nbsp

565
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:23,455
Sure.

566
00:11:23,465 --> 00:11:25,626
&nbsp

567
00:11:25,636 --> 00:11:27,959
Gonna need another glass, Detective.

568
00:11:27,969 --> 00:11:29,463
&nbsp

569
00:11:29,473 --> 00:11:30,962
- Follow him.
- Mm-hmm.

570
00:11:30,972 --> 00:11:30,964
&nbsp

571
00:11:30,974 --> 00:11:32,931
- See what you can get.
- What are you gonna do?

572
00:11:32,941 --> 00:11:32,933
&nbsp

573
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:35,133
I'm gonna finish this
up and convince my son

574
00:11:35,143 --> 00:11:35,135
&nbsp

575
00:11:35,145 --> 00:11:36,635
that he's not meant to be a superhero.

576
00:11:36,645 --> 00:11:36,637
&nbsp

577
00:11:36,647 --> 00:11:37,969
Good idea.

578
00:11:37,979 --> 00:11:44,478
&nbsp

579
00:11:44,488 --> 00:11:46,244
So, how'd I do?

580
00:11:46,254 --> 00:11:46,246
&nbsp

581
00:11:46,256 --> 00:11:48,780
Blood pressure, heart rate,
metabolic rate all excellent.

582
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:48,782
&nbsp

583
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,715
And you've got some serious speed, girl.

584
00:11:50,725 --> 00:11:50,717
&nbsp

585
00:11:50,727 --> 00:11:52,751
- Mm-hmm.
- I think you're good to go.

586
00:11:52,761 --> 00:11:52,753
&nbsp

587
00:11:52,763 --> 00:11:54,119
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

588
00:11:54,129 --> 00:11:54,121
&nbsp

589
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:55,487
I still want to run a few more tests.

590
00:11:55,497 --> 00:11:55,489
&nbsp

591
00:11:55,499 --> 00:11:59,624
- Like what?
- Like more tests.

592
00:11:59,634 --> 00:11:59,626
&nbsp

593
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,993
Hey, so, is Wally here?

594
00:12:02,003 --> 00:12:01,995
&nbsp

595
00:12:02,005 --> 00:12:03,695
No, not yet.

596
00:12:03,705 --> 00:12:03,697
&nbsp

597
00:12:03,707 --> 00:12:05,664
Right. Um...

598
00:12:05,674 --> 00:12:05,666
&nbsp

599
00:12:05,676 --> 00:12:07,432
Okay, I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go grab some food.

600
00:12:07,442 --> 00:12:07,434
&nbsp

601
00:12:07,444 --> 00:12:08,633
I'm starving.

602
00:12:08,643 --> 00:12:08,635
&nbsp

603
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:11,398
Yeah, there's some PowerBars
in the workshop. Help yourself.

604
00:12:11,408 --> 00:12:11,408
&nbsp

605
00:12:11,418 --> 00:12:12,408
Cool.

606
00:12:12,418 --> 00:12:13,307
&nbsp

607
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:15,273
- Harry?
- Mm-hmm?

608
00:12:15,283 --> 00:12:15,275
&nbsp

609
00:12:15,285 --> 00:12:17,609
- What're you doing?
- Being thorough.

610
00:12:17,619 --> 00:12:17,611
&nbsp

611
00:12:17,621 --> 00:12:19,444
Yeah? 'Cause it seems
like you're stalling.

612
00:12:19,454 --> 00:12:19,446
&nbsp

613
00:12:19,456 --> 00:12:20,612
Okay, fine. I'm stalling.

614
00:12:20,622 --> 00:12:20,614
&nbsp

615
00:12:20,624 --> 00:12:22,180
I'm stalling. So what?

616
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:22,182
&nbsp

617
00:12:22,192 --> 00:12:23,248
So what? So why?

618
00:12:23,258 --> 00:12:23,250
&nbsp

619
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,616
So why? Why?

620
00:12:24,626 --> 00:12:24,618
&nbsp

621
00:12:24,628 --> 00:12:26,284
Why? I got to explain myself to you two?

622
00:12:26,294 --> 00:12:26,286
&nbsp

623
00:12:26,296 --> 00:12:27,752
Oh, I guess I do,
'cause you're not parents.

624
00:12:27,762 --> 00:12:27,754
&nbsp

625
00:12:27,764 --> 00:12:30,355
That's my daughter, okay?

626
00:12:30,365 --> 00:12:30,357
&nbsp

627
00:12:30,367 --> 00:12:32,824
And she spent months on this very Earth

628
00:12:32,834 --> 00:12:32,826
&nbsp

629
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:35,460
watching Barry Allen defeat
meta after meta after meta...

630
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:35,462
&nbsp

631
00:12:35,472 --> 00:12:37,529
And Zoom... And all of a sudden, bam!

632
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:37,531
&nbsp

633
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,331
She's got speed, and now she wants

634
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:39,333
&nbsp

635
00:12:39,343 --> 00:12:40,532
to be a hero just like him.

636
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:40,534
&nbsp

637
00:12:40,544 --> 00:12:43,835
And I think that's a great idea. Not!

638
00:12:43,845 --> 00:12:43,837
&nbsp

639
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:45,203
Harry, we can help her.

640
00:12:45,213 --> 00:12:45,205
&nbsp

641
00:12:45,215 --> 00:12:46,538
We can train her just
like we did with Barry.

642
00:12:46,548 --> 00:12:46,540
&nbsp

643
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:48,039
I don't want you to train her, okay?

644
00:12:48,049 --> 00:12:48,041
&nbsp

645
00:12:48,051 --> 00:12:50,508
I brought her here for you
to talk her out of it,

646
00:12:50,518 --> 00:12:50,510
&nbsp

647
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,510
not talk her into it, all right, Ramon?

648
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:52,512
&nbsp

649
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,512
You... you should talk
to her. You're a meta.

650
00:12:54,522 --> 00:12:54,514
&nbsp

651
00:12:54,524 --> 00:12:56,948
Yeah, which makes me the last person

652
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:56,950
&nbsp

653
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,516
she should talk to about
not using her powers.

654
00:12:58,526 --> 00:12:58,518
&nbsp

655
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:00,418
Okay, Snow...

656
00:13:00,428 --> 00:13:00,420
&nbsp

657
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:02,354
Caitlin...

658
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:02,356
&nbsp

659
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:03,888
You and her,

660
00:13:03,898 --> 00:13:03,890
&nbsp

661
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,490
you've always had such
a special relationship.

662
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:05,492
&nbsp

663
00:13:05,502 --> 00:13:06,624
You talk to her.

664
00:13:06,634 --> 00:13:06,626
&nbsp

665
00:13:06,636 --> 00:13:08,993
- No, we don't.
- Yeah.

666
00:13:09,003 --> 00:13:08,995
&nbsp

667
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:10,528
And I don't know anything
about having powers,

668
00:13:10,538 --> 00:13:10,530
&nbsp

669
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,464
so I'm the last person
you should talk to,

670
00:13:12,474 --> 00:13:12,466
&nbsp

671
00:13:12,476 --> 00:13:13,598
so don't ask me.

672
00:13:13,608 --> 00:13:13,600
&nbsp

673
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:15,066
Wait, I...

674
00:13:15,076 --> 00:13:15,068
&nbsp

675
00:13:15,078 --> 00:13:16,794
It can't...

676
00:13:16,804 --> 00:13:19,501
&nbsp

677
00:13:19,511 --> 00:13:20,972
Dad.

678
00:13:20,982 --> 00:13:21,742
&nbsp

679
00:13:21,752 --> 00:13:23,441
What's going on?
Why'd you want to see me?

680
00:13:23,451 --> 00:13:23,443
&nbsp

681
00:13:23,453 --> 00:13:24,743
Oh, hey.

682
00:13:24,753 --> 00:13:24,745
&nbsp

683
00:13:24,755 --> 00:13:25,810
Uh...

684
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:25,812
&nbsp

685
00:13:25,822 --> 00:13:26,978
Have a seat.

686
00:13:26,988 --> 00:13:31,818
&nbsp

687
00:13:31,828 --> 00:13:33,151
Look...

688
00:13:33,161 --> 00:13:33,887
&nbsp

689
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:37,188
I know it's been really hard for you,

690
00:13:37,198 --> 00:13:37,190
&nbsp

691
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,125
seeing Jesse with speed.

692
00:13:40,135 --> 00:13:41,294
&nbsp

693
00:13:41,304 --> 00:13:44,629
I just keep thinking of what Harry said.

694
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:44,631
&nbsp

695
00:13:44,641 --> 00:13:48,564
How sometimes it takes a
while for powers to manifest.

696
00:13:48,574 --> 00:13:48,767
&nbsp

697
00:13:48,777 --> 00:13:51,867
Yeah, Harry also said that
they may never manifest.

698
00:13:51,877 --> 00:13:51,877
&nbsp

699
00:13:51,887 --> 00:13:54,272
Yes, but I got hit by
that dark matter too,

700
00:13:54,282 --> 00:13:54,274
&nbsp

701
00:13:54,284 --> 00:13:56,307
just like Jesse.

702
00:13:56,317 --> 00:13:56,309
&nbsp

703
00:13:56,319 --> 00:13:58,559
Could still happen for me somehow.

704
00:13:58,569 --> 00:13:58,690
&nbsp

705
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,945
Look, you weren't here

706
00:14:00,955 --> 00:14:00,947
&nbsp

707
00:14:00,957 --> 00:14:04,416
when the first particle
accelerator exploded.

708
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:04,418
&nbsp

709
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:07,819
That dark matter went
throughout the whole city.

710
00:14:07,829 --> 00:14:07,821
&nbsp

711
00:14:07,831 --> 00:14:09,287
Everybody got hit.

712
00:14:09,297 --> 00:14:09,289
&nbsp

713
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:13,358
Me, your sister, this whole precinct.

714
00:14:13,368 --> 00:14:13,360
&nbsp

715
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:16,161
Do you know how many metas
there have been so far?

716
00:14:16,171 --> 00:14:16,163
&nbsp

717
00:14:16,173 --> 00:14:18,463
I know you want this more than anything,

718
00:14:18,473 --> 00:14:18,465
&nbsp

719
00:14:18,475 --> 00:14:22,600
but you have to face the fact
that it might not happen.

720
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:22,602
&nbsp

721
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:25,303
So you think, just let it go?

722
00:14:25,313 --> 00:14:25,305
&nbsp

723
00:14:25,315 --> 00:14:28,740
Give up on wanting to help people?

724
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:28,742
&nbsp

725
00:14:28,752 --> 00:14:30,942
You don't need powers to do that.

726
00:14:30,952 --> 00:14:30,944
&nbsp

727
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,777
Look, Barry was coming to the rescue

728
00:14:32,787 --> 00:14:32,779
&nbsp

729
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:34,979
as a CSI long before he was the Flash.

730
00:14:34,989 --> 00:14:34,981
&nbsp

731
00:14:34,991 --> 00:14:36,281
He wanted to help people then

732
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:36,283
&nbsp

733
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:37,715
just like you want to help people now.

734
00:14:37,725 --> 00:14:37,717
&nbsp

735
00:14:37,727 --> 00:14:39,250
So he studied.

736
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:39,252
&nbsp

737
00:14:39,262 --> 00:14:41,653
He honed that brilliant mind of his.

738
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:41,655
&nbsp

739
00:14:41,665 --> 00:14:43,521
And you have the same
brilliant mind, Wall.

740
00:14:43,531 --> 00:14:43,523
&nbsp

741
00:14:43,533 --> 00:14:44,923
- Dad...
- No, I mean it, son.

742
00:14:44,933 --> 00:14:44,925
&nbsp

743
00:14:44,935 --> 00:14:46,925
Look, a lot of people dream

744
00:14:46,935 --> 00:14:46,927
&nbsp

745
00:14:46,937 --> 00:14:49,160
about making the world a better place.

746
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:49,162
&nbsp

747
00:14:49,172 --> 00:14:52,464
With that mind of yours and
that engineering talent,

748
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:52,466
&nbsp

749
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:55,867
you literally could
build a better world.

750
00:14:55,877 --> 00:14:58,572
&nbsp

751
00:14:58,582 --> 00:15:00,271
So what?

752
00:15:00,281 --> 00:15:00,273
&nbsp

753
00:15:00,283 --> 00:15:01,473
I got to stay in school?

754
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:01,475
&nbsp

755
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:03,208
Yeah, you got to stay in school.

756
00:15:03,218 --> 00:15:03,210
&nbsp

757
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:05,577
Just a couple more years.

758
00:15:05,587 --> 00:15:10,458
&nbsp

759
00:15:10,468 --> 00:15:11,483
What are you doing?

760
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:11,485
&nbsp

761
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:14,986
I assumed you'd taken
a DNA sample before.

762
00:15:14,996 --> 00:15:14,988
&nbsp

763
00:15:14,998 --> 00:15:17,055
Okay, yes. I know what you're doing.

764
00:15:17,065 --> 00:15:17,057
&nbsp

765
00:15:17,067 --> 00:15:18,957
I mean, why are you doing it?

766
00:15:18,967 --> 00:15:18,959
&nbsp

767
00:15:18,969 --> 00:15:21,960
Are you looking to steal another sample?

768
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:21,962
&nbsp

769
00:15:21,972 --> 00:15:23,213
I've isolated an element

770
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:23,223
&nbsp

771
00:15:23,233 --> 00:15:25,830
consistent in all five of
the husks that we've found,

772
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:25,832
&nbsp

773
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:28,433
including Edward Clariss's.

774
00:15:28,443 --> 00:15:28,435
&nbsp

775
00:15:28,445 --> 00:15:29,807
- You mean the Rival?
- Mm.

776
00:15:29,817 --> 00:15:29,817
&nbsp

777
00:15:29,827 --> 00:15:32,770
That's what the papers
are calling him, yes.

778
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:32,772
&nbsp

779
00:15:32,782 --> 00:15:34,138
What's the element?

780
00:15:34,148 --> 00:15:34,140
&nbsp

781
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,473
I don't know.

782
00:15:35,483 --> 00:15:35,475
&nbsp

783
00:15:35,485 --> 00:15:37,408
But it's not one that I've found

784
00:15:37,418 --> 00:15:37,410
&nbsp

785
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:40,945
in any other meta-human
samples that I've studied.

786
00:15:40,955 --> 00:15:40,947
&nbsp

787
00:15:40,957 --> 00:15:43,982
So you think that Frankie,
the girl downstairs,

788
00:15:43,992 --> 00:15:43,984
&nbsp

789
00:15:43,994 --> 00:15:45,950
has the same element in her DNA?

790
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:45,952
&nbsp

791
00:15:45,962 --> 00:15:48,086
Well, I wouldn't be comparing samples

792
00:15:48,096 --> 00:15:48,088
&nbsp

793
00:15:48,098 --> 00:15:50,588
if it wasn't a possibility,
would I, Allen?

794
00:15:50,598 --> 00:15:52,826
&nbsp

795
00:15:52,836 --> 00:15:55,226
It's a good thing for both of us I did.

796
00:15:55,236 --> 00:15:55,228
&nbsp

797
00:15:55,238 --> 00:15:57,595
- Come on.
- What?

798
00:15:57,605 --> 00:16:00,367
&nbsp

799
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:01,900
- Where is she?
- Calm down, okay? Julian?

800
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:01,902
&nbsp

801
00:16:01,912 --> 00:16:03,968
You! You, girl! Stop!

802
00:16:03,978 --> 00:16:03,970
&nbsp

803
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,236
- Hey, ease up, Julian.
- Stop!

804
00:16:05,246 --> 00:16:05,238
&nbsp

805
00:16:05,248 --> 00:16:06,504
- Me?
- You did it, didn't you?

806
00:16:06,514 --> 00:16:06,506
&nbsp

807
00:16:06,516 --> 00:16:07,805
What?

808
00:16:07,815 --> 00:16:07,807
&nbsp

809
00:16:07,817 --> 00:16:09,007
The lamppost. You did it, didn't you?

810
00:16:09,017 --> 00:16:09,009
&nbsp

811
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:10,174
What? No, no, no, stop.

812
00:16:10,184 --> 00:16:10,176
&nbsp

813
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:11,643
- You're a liar!
- Julian!

814
00:16:11,653 --> 00:16:11,645
&nbsp

815
00:16:11,655 --> 00:16:13,845
- You're a meta-human.
- Stop, no, stop!

816
00:16:13,855 --> 00:16:13,847
&nbsp

817
00:16:13,857 --> 00:16:15,914
You put your foster father
in the hospital, didn't you?

818
00:16:15,924 --> 00:16:15,916
&nbsp

819
00:16:15,926 --> 00:16:18,483
- No, no!
- Didn't you?

820
00:16:18,493 --> 00:16:18,485
&nbsp

821
00:16:18,495 --> 00:16:19,951
Didn't you?

822
00:16:19,961 --> 00:16:22,956
&nbsp

823
00:16:22,966 --> 00:16:26,457
Oh, I wanted to do more than hurt him.

824
00:16:26,467 --> 00:16:26,459
&nbsp

825
00:16:26,469 --> 00:16:30,528
Now I'm gonna do the same to you.

826
00:16:30,538 --> 00:16:43,447
&nbsp

827
00:16:43,457 --> 00:16:44,614
Frankie!

828
00:16:44,624 --> 00:16:44,616
&nbsp

829
00:16:44,626 --> 00:16:45,848
Frankie, stop!

830
00:16:45,858 --> 00:16:57,061
&nbsp

831
00:16:57,071 --> 00:16:58,461
Are you okay?

832
00:16:58,471 --> 00:17:05,603
&nbsp

833
00:17:05,613 --> 00:17:06,569
Frankie!

834
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:06,571
&nbsp

835
00:17:06,581 --> 00:17:07,603
No.

836
00:17:07,613 --> 00:17:07,605
&nbsp

837
00:17:07,615 --> 00:17:09,205
Frankie's gone.

838
00:17:09,215 --> 00:17:09,207
&nbsp

839
00:17:09,217 --> 00:17:11,874
My name is Magenta.

840
00:17:11,884 --> 00:17:11,876
&nbsp

841
00:17:11,886 --> 00:17:13,409
You're like this because of Alchemy.

842
00:17:13,419 --> 00:17:13,411
&nbsp

843
00:17:13,421 --> 00:17:16,112
He changed you, didn't he?

844
00:17:16,122 --> 00:17:16,114
&nbsp

845
00:17:16,124 --> 00:17:17,780
This isn't you.

846
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:17,782
&nbsp

847
00:17:17,792 --> 00:17:19,515
Just come with me.

848
00:17:19,525 --> 00:17:21,252
&nbsp

849
00:17:21,262 --> 00:17:22,785
Tell me what happened.

850
00:17:22,795 --> 00:17:22,787
&nbsp

851
00:17:22,797 --> 00:17:24,520
I can help you.

852
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:24,522
&nbsp

853
00:17:24,532 --> 00:17:28,024
I don't need any more help, Flash.

854
00:17:28,034 --> 00:17:28,026
&nbsp

855
00:17:28,036 --> 00:17:31,360
I just don't want anyone to get hurt.

856
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:31,362
&nbsp

857
00:17:31,372 --> 00:17:33,262
It's too late for that.

858
00:17:33,272 --> 00:17:36,467
&nbsp

859
00:17:36,477 --> 00:17:37,833
Frankie, don't!

860
00:17:37,843 --> 00:17:37,835
&nbsp

861
00:17:37,845 --> 00:17:39,368
It's me...

862
00:17:39,378 --> 00:17:39,370
&nbsp

863
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,370
or him.

864
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:41,372
&nbsp

865
00:17:41,382 --> 00:17:44,206
Come on.

866
00:17:44,216 --> 00:17:44,208
&nbsp

867
00:17:44,218 --> 00:17:45,541
Aah!

868
00:17:45,551 --> 00:17:55,911
&nbsp

869
00:17:55,921 --> 00:17:57,135
Her name's Frankie Kane,

870
00:17:57,145 --> 00:17:57,145
&nbsp

871
00:17:57,155 --> 00:17:59,490
but she's calling herself Magenta.

872
00:17:59,500 --> 00:17:59,500
&nbsp

873
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,564
Meh.

874
00:18:00,574 --> 00:18:00,574
&nbsp

875
00:18:00,584 --> 00:18:02,558
That Magenta is a whole different person

876
00:18:02,568 --> 00:18:02,560
&nbsp

877
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:05,861
than the scared,
kind girl I was interviewing.

878
00:18:05,871 --> 00:18:05,863
&nbsp

879
00:18:05,873 --> 00:18:07,063
She's dissociative.

880
00:18:07,073 --> 00:18:07,065
&nbsp

881
00:18:07,075 --> 00:18:08,731
You mean split-personality.

882
00:18:08,741 --> 00:18:08,914
&nbsp

883
00:18:08,924 --> 00:18:10,413
According to her medical records,

884
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:10,415
&nbsp

885
00:18:10,425 --> 00:18:11,681
it's a condition she's been dealing with

886
00:18:11,691 --> 00:18:11,683
&nbsp

887
00:18:11,693 --> 00:18:12,816
her entire life.

888
00:18:12,826 --> 00:18:12,818
&nbsp

889
00:18:12,828 --> 00:18:15,752
I'm sure all the yelling at
CCPD is what triggered it.

890
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:15,754
&nbsp

891
00:18:15,764 --> 00:18:17,721
So Frankie is Jekyll. Magenta is Hyde.

892
00:18:17,731 --> 00:18:17,723
&nbsp

893
00:18:17,733 --> 00:18:18,922
Classic good versus evil.

894
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:18,924
&nbsp

895
00:18:18,934 --> 00:18:21,758
Or she's pulling a “Primal Fear.”

896
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:21,760
&nbsp

897
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,527
- She's faking it.
- No, she's not faking it.

898
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:23,529
&nbsp

899
00:18:23,539 --> 00:18:25,562
I saw the struggle
going on inside of her.

900
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:25,564
&nbsp

901
00:18:25,574 --> 00:18:27,931
Magenta's trying to
take over completely.

902
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:27,933
&nbsp

903
00:18:27,943 --> 00:18:31,134
You said she was raised in
the foster care system.

904
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:31,136
&nbsp

905
00:18:31,146 --> 00:18:33,303
Yep, all her life.
She went from home to home.

906
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:33,305
&nbsp

907
00:18:33,315 --> 00:18:34,871
Yeah, and maybe not good ones.

908
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:34,873
&nbsp

909
00:18:34,883 --> 00:18:36,306
Her current foster father, John...

910
00:18:36,316 --> 00:18:36,308
&nbsp

911
00:18:36,318 --> 00:18:38,008
The one who was hurt in the attack...

912
00:18:38,018 --> 00:18:38,010
&nbsp

913
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,143
Yeah, he's got a few
disorderly conducts.

914
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:40,145
&nbsp

915
00:18:40,155 --> 00:18:41,578
He might have some
information we can use.

916
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:41,580
&nbsp

917
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,947
I can follow up with him.

918
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:43,949
&nbsp

919
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:45,315
There is something else.

920
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:45,317
&nbsp

921
00:18:45,327 --> 00:18:47,751
She got her powers from Alchemy.

922
00:18:47,761 --> 00:18:47,753
&nbsp

923
00:18:47,763 --> 00:18:50,086
When I said his name,
she knew who he was,

924
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:50,088
&nbsp

925
00:18:50,098 --> 00:18:52,756
so Magenta must have existed
in the other timeline too.

926
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:52,758
&nbsp

927
00:18:52,768 --> 00:18:54,291
Who's Alchemy?

928
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:54,293
&nbsp

929
00:18:54,303 --> 00:18:58,328
Well, Doctor Alchemy is
a magic man in a cloak

930
00:18:58,338 --> 00:18:58,330
&nbsp

931
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,064
who can somehow restore
the powers that people had

932
00:19:01,074 --> 00:19:01,066
&nbsp

933
00:19:01,076 --> 00:19:02,499
in Flashpoint.

934
00:19:02,509 --> 00:19:02,501
&nbsp

935
00:19:02,511 --> 00:19:05,001
Okay, and what's Flashpoint?

936
00:19:05,011 --> 00:19:05,003
&nbsp

937
00:19:05,013 --> 00:19:07,037
That's what we're calling
the alternate timeline

938
00:19:07,047 --> 00:19:07,039
&nbsp

939
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:10,040
that Barry created when he went
back in time and saved his mom.

940
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:10,042
&nbsp

941
00:19:10,052 --> 00:19:11,241
Oh.

942
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:11,243
&nbsp

943
00:19:11,253 --> 00:19:12,909
So Magenta is another side-effect

944
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:12,911
&nbsp

945
00:19:12,921 --> 00:19:14,010
from your time trip.

946
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,012
&nbsp

947
00:19:14,022 --> 00:19:16,713
Genius. Not.

948
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:16,715
&nbsp

949
00:19:16,725 --> 00:19:18,481
I don't need to be reminded. Thank you.

950
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:18,483
&nbsp

951
00:19:18,493 --> 00:19:20,517
Look, anybody with those powers

952
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:20,519
&nbsp

953
00:19:20,529 --> 00:19:23,220
and as angry as her needs
to be tracked down.

954
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:23,222
&nbsp

955
00:19:23,232 --> 00:19:24,321
Fast.

956
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:24,323
&nbsp

957
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:27,424
Well, great. I mean, fast I can do.
Let me just go carb-load.

958
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:27,426
&nbsp

959
00:19:27,436 --> 00:19:30,360
He didn't... That's... you don't...

960
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,924
&nbsp

961
00:19:32,934 --> 00:19:34,397
Snow.

962
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:36,134
&nbsp

963
00:19:36,144 --> 00:19:37,901
Please.

964
00:19:37,911 --> 00:19:39,171
&nbsp

965
00:19:39,181 --> 00:19:40,637
Okay, Harry, I'll talk to her,

966
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:40,639
&nbsp

967
00:19:40,649 --> 00:19:43,974
but I don't know what I'm gonna say.

968
00:19:43,984 --> 00:19:43,976
&nbsp

969
00:19:43,986 --> 00:19:45,008
Hey, Joe?

970
00:19:45,018 --> 00:19:45,010
&nbsp

971
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,877
Did you talk to Wally?

972
00:19:46,887 --> 00:19:46,879
&nbsp

973
00:19:46,889 --> 00:19:48,812
He still seems a little bummed.

974
00:19:48,822 --> 00:19:48,814
&nbsp

975
00:19:48,824 --> 00:19:50,380
It's not gonna fix itself overnight,

976
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:50,382
&nbsp

977
00:19:50,392 --> 00:19:52,382
- but it's all good. He gets it.
- Okay.

978
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:52,384
&nbsp

979
00:19:52,394 --> 00:19:55,418
And I got to be honest, it was one
of my better dad cop speeches.

980
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:55,420
&nbsp

981
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,744
What's “dad cop”?

982
00:19:56,754 --> 00:19:56,754
&nbsp

983
00:19:56,764 --> 00:19:59,856
There's good cop and
bad cop and dad cop.

984
00:19:59,866 --> 00:19:59,858
&nbsp

985
00:19:59,868 --> 00:20:02,292
Firm but reassuring. Cuts to the point.

986
00:20:02,302 --> 00:20:02,294
&nbsp

987
00:20:02,304 --> 00:20:03,578
I don't think I know that one.

988
00:20:03,588 --> 00:20:03,588
&nbsp

989
00:20:03,598 --> 00:20:04,754
Yeah, I didn't use it on you.

990
00:20:04,764 --> 00:20:04,756
&nbsp

991
00:20:04,766 --> 00:20:05,855
Wally's different than you, Barry.

992
00:20:05,865 --> 00:20:05,857
&nbsp

993
00:20:05,867 --> 00:20:07,957
You're like a second daughter.

994
00:20:07,967 --> 00:20:07,959
&nbsp

995
00:20:07,969 --> 00:20:09,526
You over-share your feelings.

996
00:20:09,536 --> 00:20:09,528
&nbsp

997
00:20:09,538 --> 00:20:12,095
Him, I got to be a little more nuanced.

998
00:20:12,105 --> 00:20:12,097
&nbsp

999
00:20:12,107 --> 00:20:14,264
Huh. Cool.

1000
00:20:14,274 --> 00:20:14,266
&nbsp

1001
00:20:14,276 --> 00:20:15,999
I'm messing with you.

1002
00:20:16,009 --> 00:20:16,001
&nbsp

1003
00:20:16,011 --> 00:20:18,034
I'll talk at you if I get any
leads on Frankie, all right?

1004
00:20:18,044 --> 00:20:18,036
&nbsp

1005
00:20:18,046 --> 00:20:19,736
All right.

1006
00:20:19,746 --> 00:20:19,738
&nbsp

1007
00:20:19,748 --> 00:20:23,239
Second daughter?
What is he talking about?

1008
00:20:23,249 --> 00:20:23,241
&nbsp

1009
00:20:23,251 --> 00:20:24,808
Hey!

1010
00:20:24,818 --> 00:20:24,810
&nbsp

1011
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,577
Hey. Hey, sorry.

1012
00:20:27,587 --> 00:20:27,579
&nbsp

1013
00:20:27,589 --> 00:20:28,845
You guys were not kidding

1014
00:20:28,855 --> 00:20:28,847
&nbsp

1015
00:20:28,857 --> 00:20:31,047
when you said speedsters
were hungry all the time.

1016
00:20:31,057 --> 00:20:31,049
&nbsp

1017
00:20:31,059 --> 00:20:32,415
Yeah.

1018
00:20:32,425 --> 00:20:32,417
&nbsp

1019
00:20:32,427 --> 00:20:36,519
Listen, Jesse, before you
speed off to find Frankie,

1020
00:20:36,529 --> 00:20:36,521
&nbsp

1021
00:20:36,531 --> 00:20:39,889
I just want to make sure that
you feel like you're ready.

1022
00:20:39,899 --> 00:20:39,891
&nbsp

1023
00:20:39,901 --> 00:20:41,090
Why?

1024
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:41,092
&nbsp

1025
00:20:41,102 --> 00:20:42,492
Is something wrong?

1026
00:20:42,502 --> 00:20:42,494
&nbsp

1027
00:20:42,504 --> 00:20:43,860
I mean, did the test
results say something?

1028
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:43,862
&nbsp

1029
00:20:43,872 --> 00:20:45,361
No, not at all.

1030
00:20:45,371 --> 00:20:45,363
&nbsp

1031
00:20:45,373 --> 00:20:46,763
All the test results have
come back fine so far.

1032
00:20:46,773 --> 00:20:46,765
&nbsp

1033
00:20:46,775 --> 00:20:48,084
It's just...

1034
00:20:48,094 --> 00:20:48,330
&nbsp

1035
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,633
maybe you should take it slow.

1036
00:20:50,643 --> 00:20:51,044
&nbsp

1037
00:20:51,054 --> 00:20:53,513
Right. This is because I'm a girl.

1038
00:20:53,523 --> 00:20:53,680
&nbsp

1039
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:54,771
What?

1040
00:20:54,781 --> 00:20:54,773
&nbsp

1041
00:20:54,783 --> 00:20:56,773
No, not at all. Why?

1042
00:20:56,783 --> 00:20:56,775
&nbsp

1043
00:20:56,785 --> 00:20:59,075
Well, I mean, Barry didn't
have to take things slow.

1044
00:20:59,085 --> 00:20:59,077
&nbsp

1045
00:20:59,087 --> 00:21:00,310
You know, he was stopping the criminals

1046
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:00,312
&nbsp

1047
00:21:00,322 --> 00:21:02,334
the second he got his powers.

1048
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:02,344
&nbsp

1049
00:21:02,354 --> 00:21:04,414
Why can't I do the same thing?

1050
00:21:04,424 --> 00:21:04,416
&nbsp

1051
00:21:04,426 --> 00:21:06,716
Well, I mean, I'm sure you think

1052
00:21:06,726 --> 00:21:06,718
&nbsp

1053
00:21:06,728 --> 00:21:08,751
that it's a great thing to have powers,

1054
00:21:08,761 --> 00:21:08,753
&nbsp

1055
00:21:08,763 --> 00:21:11,287
but sometimes, it's not so great.

1056
00:21:11,297 --> 00:21:11,289
&nbsp

1057
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:12,856
Trust me.

1058
00:21:12,866 --> 00:21:13,318
&nbsp

1059
00:21:13,328 --> 00:21:17,460
I'm just saying that if I had powers,

1060
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:17,462
&nbsp

1061
00:21:17,472 --> 00:21:20,463
I would probably take it slow.

1062
00:21:20,473 --> 00:21:21,134
&nbsp

1063
00:21:21,144 --> 00:21:24,024
My dad put you up to this, didn't he?

1064
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:24,034
&nbsp

1065
00:21:24,044 --> 00:21:27,237
Yeah. I mean, of course he did.

1066
00:21:27,247 --> 00:21:27,239
&nbsp

1067
00:21:27,249 --> 00:21:28,605
Jesse...

1068
00:21:28,615 --> 00:21:33,645
&nbsp

1069
00:21:33,655 --> 00:21:35,345
Hey.

1070
00:21:35,355 --> 00:21:35,347
&nbsp

1071
00:21:35,357 --> 00:21:37,680
You don't want me to
have this speed, do you?

1072
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:37,682
&nbsp

1073
00:21:37,692 --> 00:21:39,949
I mean, that's why we're here, right?

1074
00:21:39,959 --> 00:21:39,951
&nbsp

1075
00:21:39,961 --> 00:21:42,418
Not so you could test me,
but so you could get everyone

1076
00:21:42,428 --> 00:21:42,420
&nbsp

1077
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:43,853
to talk me out of using my powers.

1078
00:21:43,863 --> 00:21:43,855
&nbsp

1079
00:21:43,865 --> 00:21:45,922
I just want you to be...

1080
00:21:45,932 --> 00:21:45,924
&nbsp

1081
00:21:45,934 --> 00:21:47,624
To be safe, yeah.

1082
00:21:47,634 --> 00:21:47,626
&nbsp

1083
00:21:47,636 --> 00:21:50,026
Yeah, I know. I've heard
it my entire life.

1084
00:21:50,036 --> 00:21:50,028
&nbsp

1085
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:51,461
This is different.

1086
00:21:51,471 --> 00:21:51,463
&nbsp

1087
00:21:51,473 --> 00:21:53,763
This is way different.

1088
00:21:53,773 --> 00:21:55,000
&nbsp

1089
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,466
Yeah, no, it is.

1090
00:21:56,476 --> 00:21:56,468
&nbsp

1091
00:21:56,478 --> 00:21:58,868
- 'Cause I'm not Barry, right?
- Right.

1092
00:21:58,878 --> 00:21:58,870
&nbsp

1093
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,004
You're not Barry.

1094
00:22:01,014 --> 00:22:07,646
&nbsp

1095
00:22:07,656 --> 00:22:10,680
Let me talk to her this time.

1096
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:26,197
&nbsp

1097
00:22:26,207 --> 00:22:28,164
She's still here.

1098
00:22:28,174 --> 00:22:28,615
&nbsp

1099
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:32,835
I can feel Frankie trying
to stay in control.

1100
00:22:32,845 --> 00:22:32,837
&nbsp

1101
00:22:32,847 --> 00:22:34,404
You said I could beat her.

1102
00:22:34,414 --> 00:22:34,406
&nbsp

1103
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:36,272
What I said was

1104
00:22:36,282 --> 00:22:36,274
&nbsp

1105
00:22:36,284 --> 00:22:38,775
I'd return to you the power you had

1106
00:22:38,785 --> 00:22:38,777
&nbsp

1107
00:22:38,787 --> 00:22:41,344
to inflict your pain upon others.

1108
00:22:41,354 --> 00:22:41,346
&nbsp

1109
00:22:41,356 --> 00:22:44,814
But I need Frankie gone to do that.

1110
00:22:44,824 --> 00:22:44,816
&nbsp

1111
00:22:44,826 --> 00:22:47,684
Do you remember why you came to me?

1112
00:22:47,694 --> 00:22:47,686
&nbsp

1113
00:22:47,696 --> 00:22:49,652
I came to you

1114
00:22:49,662 --> 00:22:49,654
&nbsp

1115
00:22:49,664 --> 00:22:53,089
because you showed me a way
to stop him from hurting me.

1116
00:22:53,099 --> 00:22:53,091
&nbsp

1117
00:22:53,101 --> 00:22:57,193
Show him Magenta is in control.

1118
00:22:57,203 --> 00:22:57,195
&nbsp

1119
00:22:57,205 --> 00:22:59,195
And once you've done that,

1120
00:22:59,205 --> 00:22:59,197
&nbsp

1121
00:22:59,207 --> 00:23:02,065
Frankie will know it as well.

1122
00:23:02,075 --> 00:23:07,038
&nbsp

1123
00:23:07,048 --> 00:23:08,838
Here you are.

1124
00:23:08,848 --> 00:23:08,840
&nbsp

1125
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:10,840
Hey.

1126
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:10,842
&nbsp

1127
00:23:10,852 --> 00:23:14,877
Hey, so, where...
Where did you go yesterday?

1128
00:23:14,887 --> 00:23:14,879
&nbsp

1129
00:23:14,889 --> 00:23:16,212
Wha... I...

1130
00:23:16,222 --> 00:23:16,214
&nbsp

1131
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,581
I didn't want to
interrupt your training.

1132
00:23:18,591 --> 00:23:18,583
&nbsp

1133
00:23:18,593 --> 00:23:19,682
Right.

1134
00:23:19,692 --> 00:23:19,684
&nbsp

1135
00:23:19,694 --> 00:23:21,017
Yeah, well, looks like

1136
00:23:21,027 --> 00:23:21,019
&nbsp

1137
00:23:21,029 --> 00:23:22,685
there won't be much of that anymore,

1138
00:23:22,695 --> 00:23:22,687
&nbsp

1139
00:23:22,697 --> 00:23:28,057
now that my dad is getting everyone
to talk me out of using my powers.

1140
00:23:28,067 --> 00:23:28,059
&nbsp

1141
00:23:28,069 --> 00:23:30,393
Wait, that... that's not
why you're here, right?

1142
00:23:30,403 --> 00:23:30,395
&nbsp

1143
00:23:30,405 --> 00:23:31,728
No, no.

1144
00:23:31,738 --> 00:23:31,730
&nbsp

1145
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,496
This is all me.

1146
00:23:33,506 --> 00:23:33,498
&nbsp

1147
00:23:33,508 --> 00:23:35,098
You all right?

1148
00:23:35,108 --> 00:23:35,100
&nbsp

1149
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:39,369
You know, when this whole thing
happened to me, you were...

1150
00:23:39,379 --> 00:23:39,371
&nbsp

1151
00:23:39,381 --> 00:23:43,081
you were actually the first
person I wanted to call.

1152
00:23:43,091 --> 00:23:43,389
&nbsp

1153
00:23:43,399 --> 00:23:46,588
Yeah, I was sort of hoping
it happened to you too.

1154
00:23:46,598 --> 00:23:47,645
&nbsp

1155
00:23:47,655 --> 00:23:50,213
I dreamt about it, believe me.

1156
00:23:50,223 --> 00:23:52,917
&nbsp

1157
00:23:52,927 --> 00:23:54,617
How did this all happen?

1158
00:23:54,627 --> 00:23:55,687
&nbsp

1159
00:23:55,697 --> 00:23:57,453
I mean, it was crazy.

1160
00:23:57,463 --> 00:23:57,455
&nbsp

1161
00:23:57,465 --> 00:23:59,188
So, like, one day,

1162
00:23:59,198 --> 00:23:59,190
&nbsp

1163
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,656
I was walking home
from a friend's house,

1164
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:00,658
&nbsp

1165
00:24:00,668 --> 00:24:03,593
and this car ran a red light,

1166
00:24:03,603 --> 00:24:03,595
&nbsp

1167
00:24:03,605 --> 00:24:06,729
and it was speeding right at me,

1168
00:24:06,739 --> 00:24:06,731
&nbsp

1169
00:24:06,741 --> 00:24:09,799
and I just stood there, frozen,
basically waiting to be hit.

1170
00:24:09,809 --> 00:24:09,801
&nbsp

1171
00:24:09,811 --> 00:24:11,067
And then I looked around,

1172
00:24:11,077 --> 00:24:11,069
&nbsp

1173
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:13,503
and everything around me was frozen too.

1174
00:24:13,513 --> 00:24:13,505
&nbsp

1175
00:24:13,515 --> 00:24:15,772
It was peaceful and quiet,

1176
00:24:15,782 --> 00:24:15,774
&nbsp

1177
00:24:15,784 --> 00:24:19,776
but I felt this, like,
electricity running in me.

1178
00:24:19,786 --> 00:24:19,778
&nbsp

1179
00:24:19,788 --> 00:24:22,879
And so I ran out of the way.

1180
00:24:22,889 --> 00:24:22,881
&nbsp

1181
00:24:22,891 --> 00:24:25,882
I kept running and running, and I...

1182
00:24:25,892 --> 00:24:25,884
&nbsp

1183
00:24:25,894 --> 00:24:28,484
I mean, now I don't ever want to stop.

1184
00:24:28,494 --> 00:24:28,486
&nbsp

1185
00:24:28,496 --> 00:24:31,921
So you basically just
jump-started your powers.

1186
00:24:31,931 --> 00:24:31,923
&nbsp

1187
00:24:31,933 --> 00:24:34,557
I mean, I guess so, yeah. Why?

1188
00:24:34,567 --> 00:24:35,794
&nbsp

1189
00:24:35,804 --> 00:24:38,494
It's good to know.

1190
00:24:38,504 --> 00:24:38,496
&nbsp

1191
00:24:38,506 --> 00:24:40,263
Wally!

1192
00:24:40,273 --> 00:24:51,800
&nbsp

1193
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,333
What are you doing?

1194
00:24:53,343 --> 00:24:53,335
&nbsp

1195
00:24:53,345 --> 00:24:54,913
Getting my speed. Why would you do that?

1196
00:24:54,923 --> 00:24:54,923
&nbsp

1197
00:24:54,933 --> 00:24:56,189
To save your life!

1198
00:24:56,199 --> 00:24:56,191
&nbsp

1199
00:24:56,201 --> 00:24:59,326
- It could've worked, Jesse!
- No, okay? Look...

1200
00:24:59,336 --> 00:24:59,328
&nbsp

1201
00:24:59,338 --> 00:25:00,627
I don't think so.

1202
00:25:00,637 --> 00:25:01,730
&nbsp

1203
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,563
I'm sorry.

1204
00:25:03,573 --> 00:25:03,565
&nbsp

1205
00:25:03,575 --> 00:25:05,899
Seriously, what the
hell were you thinking?

1206
00:25:05,909 --> 00:25:05,901
&nbsp

1207
00:25:05,911 --> 00:25:08,635
You can't just go stepping
into the street like that.

1208
00:25:08,645 --> 00:25:08,637
&nbsp

1209
00:25:08,647 --> 00:25:10,003
I mean, you got to use your head.

1210
00:25:10,013 --> 00:25:10,005
&nbsp

1211
00:25:10,015 --> 00:25:11,638
Nothing happened, Barry. Chill out.

1212
00:25:11,648 --> 00:25:11,640
&nbsp

1213
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,640
Didn't you talk to Joe about this?

1214
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:13,642
&nbsp

1215
00:25:13,652 --> 00:25:17,877
- Yeah, so?
- So it clearly didn't help.

1216
00:25:17,887 --> 00:25:17,879
&nbsp

1217
00:25:17,889 --> 00:25:19,980
What would you have done if
Jesse wasn't there, huh?

1218
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:19,982
&nbsp

1219
00:25:19,992 --> 00:25:21,514
I don't know, man.

1220
00:25:21,524 --> 00:25:21,516
&nbsp

1221
00:25:21,526 --> 00:25:23,383
Because there's nothing
you could've done.

1222
00:25:23,393 --> 00:25:23,385
&nbsp

1223
00:25:23,395 --> 00:25:25,118
Because you don't have powers.

1224
00:25:25,128 --> 00:25:25,120
&nbsp

1225
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,220
Only room in our family
for one speedster, Barry?

1226
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:27,222
&nbsp

1227
00:25:27,232 --> 00:25:30,390
Please just stop trying before
you get yourself killed.

1228
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:30,392
&nbsp

1229
00:25:30,402 --> 00:25:32,930
- You done?
- Do you have anything to say?

1230
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:32,940
&nbsp

1231
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,928
No, you pretty much covered it.

1232
00:25:34,938 --> 00:25:36,331
&nbsp

1233
00:25:36,341 --> 00:25:38,798
- This has got to stop.
- Stop yelling at me, okay?

1234
00:25:38,808 --> 00:25:38,800
&nbsp

1235
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:40,233
I saved his life.
What did you want me to do?

1236
00:25:40,243 --> 00:25:40,235
&nbsp

1237
00:25:40,245 --> 00:25:41,468
That's not the point. That is not the...

1238
00:25:41,478 --> 00:25:41,470
&nbsp

1239
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,802
No, I know the point!

1240
00:25:42,812 --> 00:25:42,804
&nbsp

1241
00:25:42,814 --> 00:25:44,204
You don't want me to use my powers.

1242
00:25:44,214 --> 00:25:44,206
&nbsp

1243
00:25:44,216 --> 00:25:45,340
- Right.
- Fine.

1244
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:45,350
&nbsp

1245
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,391
Fine, but I don't need to stay
here and listen to this anymore.

1246
00:25:48,401 --> 00:25:48,401
&nbsp

1247
00:25:48,411 --> 00:25:49,994
No... Jess. Jesse!

1248
00:25:50,004 --> 00:25:50,004
&nbsp

1249
00:25:50,014 --> 00:25:51,004
Don't...

1250
00:25:51,014 --> 00:25:54,950
&nbsp

1251
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,549
What did you say to her?

1252
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,678
&nbsp

1253
00:25:58,688 --> 00:25:59,752
Me?

1254
00:25:59,762 --> 00:25:59,762
&nbsp

1255
00:25:59,772 --> 00:26:01,988
Yeah. You.

1256
00:26:01,998 --> 00:26:01,990
&nbsp

1257
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,224
Don't blame me for this.
I tried to help.

1258
00:26:04,234 --> 00:26:04,226
&nbsp

1259
00:26:04,236 --> 00:26:06,323
Help her or help me?

1260
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:06,333
&nbsp

1261
00:26:06,343 --> 00:26:07,594
Listen, Harry.

1262
00:26:07,604 --> 00:26:07,596
&nbsp

1263
00:26:07,606 --> 00:26:09,763
Maybe the reason she's shutting you out

1264
00:26:09,773 --> 00:26:09,765
&nbsp

1265
00:26:09,775 --> 00:26:11,831
is because you're not
trying to understand

1266
00:26:11,841 --> 00:26:11,833
&nbsp

1267
00:26:11,843 --> 00:26:14,667
- what she's going through.
- I don't need to unders...

1268
00:26:14,677 --> 00:26:14,669
&nbsp

1269
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:16,536
Maybe if you helped her
navigate her powers

1270
00:26:16,546 --> 00:26:16,538
&nbsp

1271
00:26:16,548 --> 00:26:19,739
rather than just assuming
they'll destroy her,

1272
00:26:19,749 --> 00:26:19,741
&nbsp

1273
00:26:19,751 --> 00:26:23,443
she'd turn to you rather
than push you away.

1274
00:26:23,453 --> 00:26:42,804
&nbsp

1275
00:26:42,814 --> 00:26:46,724
Can't even bring myself to
take a lap around this thing.

1276
00:26:46,734 --> 00:26:46,734
&nbsp

1277
00:26:46,744 --> 00:26:47,734
Why is that?

1278
00:26:47,744 --> 00:26:47,736
&nbsp

1279
00:26:47,746 --> 00:26:50,103
I mean, you said it.
Everything's different here.

1280
00:26:50,113 --> 00:26:50,105
&nbsp

1281
00:26:50,115 --> 00:26:52,439
There's a guy creating meta-humans...

1282
00:26:52,449 --> 00:26:52,441
&nbsp

1283
00:26:52,451 --> 00:26:55,775
Innocent people...
'cause I changed the timeline.

1284
00:26:55,785 --> 00:26:55,777
&nbsp

1285
00:26:55,787 --> 00:26:56,976
It's on me.

1286
00:26:56,986 --> 00:26:56,978
&nbsp

1287
00:26:56,988 --> 00:27:00,633
Yeah, I think I know a thing or
two about what that feels like.

1288
00:27:00,643 --> 00:27:00,643
&nbsp

1289
00:27:00,653 --> 00:27:02,715
You know, I keep making mistakes.

1290
00:27:02,725 --> 00:27:02,717
&nbsp

1291
00:27:02,727 --> 00:27:03,750
I make mistakes, and then I want

1292
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:03,752
&nbsp

1293
00:27:03,762 --> 00:27:05,018
to make up for my mistakes.

1294
00:27:05,028 --> 00:27:05,020
&nbsp

1295
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,186
Then I just make more mistakes.

1296
00:27:06,196 --> 00:27:06,188
&nbsp

1297
00:27:06,198 --> 00:27:07,253
Next thing I know, I have a daughter

1298
00:27:07,263 --> 00:27:07,255
&nbsp

1299
00:27:07,265 --> 00:27:08,922
that won't even speak to me.

1300
00:27:08,932 --> 00:27:08,924
&nbsp

1301
00:27:08,934 --> 00:27:10,390
How do we keep from messing things up

1302
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:10,392
&nbsp

1303
00:27:10,402 --> 00:27:12,192
when all we want to do is help?

1304
00:27:12,202 --> 00:27:12,194
&nbsp

1305
00:27:12,204 --> 00:27:14,561
I don't know.

1306
00:27:14,571 --> 00:27:14,563
&nbsp

1307
00:27:14,573 --> 00:27:16,329
But you did once tell me

1308
00:27:16,339 --> 00:27:16,331
&nbsp

1309
00:27:16,341 --> 00:27:18,631
that you have to trust
it in the long run

1310
00:27:18,641 --> 00:27:18,633
&nbsp

1311
00:27:18,643 --> 00:27:21,101
the decisions you make
are the right ones.

1312
00:27:21,111 --> 00:27:22,771
&nbsp

1313
00:27:22,781 --> 00:27:24,070
Yeah.

1314
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,597
&nbsp

1315
00:27:26,607 --> 00:27:30,810
I was always too good at
forgiving myself, Allen.

1316
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,196
&nbsp

1317
00:27:31,206 --> 00:27:33,713
You were never good enough.

1318
00:27:33,723 --> 00:27:44,017
&nbsp

1319
00:27:44,027 --> 00:27:45,425
John James?

1320
00:27:45,435 --> 00:27:47,356
&nbsp

1321
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:48,862
Who's asking?

1322
00:27:48,872 --> 00:27:49,278
&nbsp

1323
00:27:49,288 --> 00:27:50,589
Hi, I'm Iris West.

1324
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:50,591
&nbsp

1325
00:27:50,601 --> 00:27:53,558
I'm a reporter for Central
City Picture News.

1326
00:27:53,568 --> 00:27:53,560
&nbsp

1327
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:56,361
I wanted to ask you a couple
questions about Frankie Kane.

1328
00:27:56,371 --> 00:27:56,363
&nbsp

1329
00:27:56,373 --> 00:27:58,497
They find her yet?

1330
00:27:58,507 --> 00:27:58,499
&nbsp

1331
00:27:58,509 --> 00:27:59,998
I don't believe so, no.

1332
00:28:00,008 --> 00:28:00,000
&nbsp

1333
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:02,100
Well, what the hell's taking so long?

1334
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:02,102
&nbsp

1335
00:28:02,112 --> 00:28:05,103
That damn meta-human
freak nearly killed me.

1336
00:28:05,113 --> 00:28:05,105
&nbsp

1337
00:28:05,115 --> 00:28:06,805
I know. I'm sorry.

1338
00:28:06,815 --> 00:28:06,807
&nbsp

1339
00:28:06,817 --> 00:28:09,107
That's what I get for taking
Frankie in, huh? This?

1340
00:28:09,117 --> 00:28:09,109
&nbsp

1341
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:13,111
God help me if I ever see her again.

1342
00:28:13,121 --> 00:28:13,113
&nbsp

1343
00:28:13,123 --> 00:28:14,446
What does that mean?

1344
00:28:14,456 --> 00:28:14,448
&nbsp

1345
00:28:14,458 --> 00:28:16,948
It means that she's gonna
be the one in the hospital.

1346
00:28:16,958 --> 00:28:16,950
&nbsp

1347
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,583
Tough love, John?

1348
00:28:18,593 --> 00:28:18,585
&nbsp

1349
00:28:18,595 --> 00:28:21,119
Yeah, you're damn right.

1350
00:28:21,129 --> 00:28:21,121
&nbsp

1351
00:28:21,131 --> 00:28:24,456
She was getting back at
you for hurting her.

1352
00:28:24,466 --> 00:28:24,458
&nbsp

1353
00:28:24,468 --> 00:28:27,025
And she's gonna try it again.

1354
00:28:27,035 --> 00:28:27,027
&nbsp

1355
00:28:27,037 --> 00:28:28,460
Nurse!

1356
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:28,462
&nbsp

1357
00:28:28,472 --> 00:28:30,211
We need to get this man
to a safe location.

1358
00:28:30,221 --> 00:28:30,221
&nbsp

1359
00:28:30,231 --> 00:28:31,496
Why?

1360
00:28:31,506 --> 00:28:32,666
&nbsp

1361
00:28:32,676 --> 00:28:34,433
What the hell's that?

1362
00:28:34,443 --> 00:28:42,309
&nbsp

1363
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:44,209
Oh, my God.

1364
00:28:44,219 --> 00:29:06,542
&nbsp

1365
00:29:06,552 --> 00:29:07,820
Where are you taking me?

1366
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:07,830
&nbsp

1367
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,051
Frankie is coming for you.

1368
00:29:09,061 --> 00:29:09,061
&nbsp

1369
00:29:09,071 --> 00:29:10,160
And as much as it pains me

1370
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:10,162
&nbsp

1371
00:29:10,172 --> 00:29:11,528
to help an abusive dick like you,

1372
00:29:11,538 --> 00:29:11,530
&nbsp

1373
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,963
I can't let you die.

1374
00:29:12,973 --> 00:29:12,965
&nbsp

1375
00:29:12,975 --> 00:29:14,565
What kind of alarm is that?

1376
00:29:14,575 --> 00:29:14,567
&nbsp

1377
00:29:14,577 --> 00:29:16,301
That's Iris's panic button.

1378
00:29:16,311 --> 00:29:16,311
&nbsp

1379
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:18,135
- Her what?
- Her panic button.

1380
00:29:18,145 --> 00:29:18,137
&nbsp

1381
00:29:18,147 --> 00:29:19,837
We installed them on everyone's phones.

1382
00:29:19,847 --> 00:29:19,839
&nbsp

1383
00:29:19,849 --> 00:29:21,672
'Cause we kept getting kidnapped.

1384
00:29:21,682 --> 00:29:21,674
&nbsp

1385
00:29:21,684 --> 00:29:24,008
At least something's an
improvement in this timeline.

1386
00:29:24,018 --> 00:29:24,010
&nbsp

1387
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,376
That's the hospital.

1388
00:29:25,386 --> 00:29:25,378
&nbsp

1389
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,824
Frankie's foster father's there.

1390
00:29:26,834 --> 00:29:26,834
&nbsp

1391
00:29:26,844 --> 00:29:28,834
Yeah, and Iris went to see him.

1392
00:29:28,844 --> 00:29:28,836
&nbsp

1393
00:29:28,846 --> 00:29:30,926
Looks like she's not the only one.

1394
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:32,172
&nbsp

1395
00:29:32,182 --> 00:29:35,240
- Is that a tanker?
- Th-th-that's a tanker, yeah.

1396
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:35,242
&nbsp

1397
00:29:35,252 --> 00:29:37,609
She's gonna kill him and
everyone else in there.

1398
00:29:37,619 --> 00:29:37,611
&nbsp

1399
00:29:37,621 --> 00:29:39,311
- I got to go.
- What are you gonna do?

1400
00:29:39,321 --> 00:29:39,313
&nbsp

1401
00:29:39,323 --> 00:29:40,946
You don't have superstrength.

1402
00:29:40,956 --> 00:29:40,948
&nbsp

1403
00:29:40,958 --> 00:29:42,180
Start thinking.

1404
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:49,423
&nbsp

1405
00:29:49,433 --> 00:29:50,622
Guys...

1406
00:29:50,632 --> 00:29:53,627
&nbsp

1407
00:29:53,637 --> 00:29:55,894
There's not enough time to get
everybody out of the hospital.

1408
00:29:55,904 --> 00:29:55,896
&nbsp

1409
00:29:55,906 --> 00:29:57,362
This thing's coming down.

1410
00:29:57,372 --> 00:29:57,364
&nbsp

1411
00:29:57,374 --> 00:29:58,830
Barry, Iris is still in there.

1412
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,300
&nbsp

1413
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,734
What if... What if I
create a wind funnel?

1414
00:30:02,744 --> 00:30:02,736
&nbsp

1415
00:30:02,746 --> 00:30:05,170
You won't be creating enough
updraft to keep that tanker up.

1416
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:05,172
&nbsp

1417
00:30:05,182 --> 00:30:06,872
No, no. Not with my arms.

1418
00:30:06,882 --> 00:30:06,874
&nbsp

1419
00:30:06,884 --> 00:30:08,193
If I run.

1420
00:30:08,203 --> 00:30:08,203
&nbsp

1421
00:30:08,213 --> 00:30:09,941
- That could...
- Propeller.

1422
00:30:09,951 --> 00:30:09,943
&nbsp

1423
00:30:09,953 --> 00:30:11,466
That could work. Barry!

1424
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:11,476
&nbsp

1425
00:30:11,486 --> 00:30:13,545
Run in a figure eight fashion.
You'll act like a propeller.

1426
00:30:13,555 --> 00:30:13,547
&nbsp

1427
00:30:13,557 --> 00:30:15,280
The wind will build upon itself.

1428
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:15,282
&nbsp

1429
00:30:15,292 --> 00:30:16,982
It'll create the supersonic
resistance we need.

1430
00:30:16,992 --> 00:30:16,984
&nbsp

1431
00:30:16,994 --> 00:30:18,250
Could work.

1432
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:18,252
&nbsp

1433
00:30:18,262 --> 00:30:19,317
All right.

1434
00:30:19,327 --> 00:30:25,861
&nbsp

1435
00:30:25,871 --> 00:30:27,559
Bye-bye, Daddy.

1436
00:30:27,569 --> 00:30:31,298
&nbsp

1437
00:30:31,308 --> 00:30:32,931
Flash!

1438
00:30:32,941 --> 00:30:38,472
&nbsp

1439
00:30:38,482 --> 00:30:40,906
Okay, well, that worked, but now what?

1440
00:30:40,916 --> 00:30:40,908
&nbsp

1441
00:30:40,918 --> 00:30:42,374
He can't stop her if he's up there.

1442
00:30:42,384 --> 00:30:46,380
&nbsp

1443
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:48,593
Cisco's right.

1444
00:30:48,603 --> 00:30:49,516
&nbsp

1445
00:30:49,526 --> 00:30:51,283
Go help him.

1446
00:30:51,293 --> 00:30:51,285
&nbsp

1447
00:30:51,295 --> 00:30:52,350
Dad.

1448
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:52,352
&nbsp

1449
00:30:52,362 --> 00:30:54,019
You need to get out there, now.

1450
00:30:54,029 --> 00:30:54,021
&nbsp

1451
00:30:54,031 --> 00:30:55,987
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

1452
00:30:55,997 --> 00:30:55,989
&nbsp

1453
00:30:55,999 --> 00:30:57,856
I know you can do it.

1454
00:30:57,866 --> 00:30:57,858
&nbsp

1455
00:30:57,868 --> 00:31:00,358
You're more than fast enough.

1456
00:31:00,368 --> 00:31:00,360
&nbsp

1457
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:03,161
Now, run, Jesse.

1458
00:31:03,171 --> 00:31:03,163
&nbsp

1459
00:31:03,173 --> 00:31:04,396
Run!

1460
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:10,145
&nbsp

1461
00:31:10,155 --> 00:31:12,971
Hey, thought you could
use a little help.

1462
00:31:12,981 --> 00:31:12,973
&nbsp

1463
00:31:12,983 --> 00:31:15,907
I got this. You go take care of her.

1464
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:19,212
&nbsp

1465
00:31:19,222 --> 00:31:21,446
Magenta!

1466
00:31:21,456 --> 00:31:21,448
&nbsp

1467
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:23,181
I got a little help.

1468
00:31:23,191 --> 00:31:23,183
&nbsp

1469
00:31:23,193 --> 00:31:26,084
So I could help you.

1470
00:31:26,094 --> 00:31:26,086
&nbsp

1471
00:31:26,096 --> 00:31:27,886
Okay, killing your foster father

1472
00:31:27,896 --> 00:31:27,888
&nbsp

1473
00:31:27,898 --> 00:31:29,487
and everyone else inside that hospital

1474
00:31:29,497 --> 00:31:29,489
&nbsp

1475
00:31:29,499 --> 00:31:31,222
isn't gonna give you what you need.

1476
00:31:31,232 --> 00:31:31,224
&nbsp

1477
00:31:31,234 --> 00:31:35,060
You have no idea what I need!

1478
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:35,062
&nbsp

1479
00:31:35,072 --> 00:31:38,229
It's not just John that
I want to get rid of.

1480
00:31:38,239 --> 00:31:38,231
&nbsp

1481
00:31:38,241 --> 00:31:40,265
I want them both gone.

1482
00:31:40,275 --> 00:31:45,906
&nbsp

1483
00:31:45,916 --> 00:31:47,172
Barry, you got to stop her now.

1484
00:31:47,182 --> 00:31:47,174
&nbsp

1485
00:31:47,184 --> 00:31:49,507
That tanker's coming down!

1486
00:31:49,517 --> 00:31:49,509
&nbsp

1487
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,710
I know you're still in there, Frankie.

1488
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:51,712
&nbsp

1489
00:31:51,722 --> 00:31:55,513
Don't let John destroy the
good that's still inside you.

1490
00:31:55,523 --> 00:31:55,909
&nbsp

1491
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,083
He said I was weak.

1492
00:31:58,093 --> 00:31:58,085
&nbsp

1493
00:31:58,095 --> 00:31:59,718
That I was pathetic!

1494
00:31:59,728 --> 00:32:01,221
&nbsp

1495
00:32:01,231 --> 00:32:03,521
He said I was a horrible person.

1496
00:32:03,531 --> 00:32:03,523
&nbsp

1497
00:32:03,533 --> 00:32:06,491
He's just blaming you for all the
bad things he's caused in his life.

1498
00:32:06,501 --> 00:32:06,493
&nbsp

1499
00:32:06,503 --> 00:32:08,026
It's not your fault.

1500
00:32:08,036 --> 00:32:08,028
&nbsp

1501
00:32:08,038 --> 00:32:11,229
This isn't because of you.

1502
00:32:11,239 --> 00:32:11,231
&nbsp

1503
00:32:11,241 --> 00:32:14,065
I just want him to stop hurting me.

1504
00:32:14,075 --> 00:32:14,067
&nbsp

1505
00:32:14,077 --> 00:32:15,967
This isn't the way.

1506
00:32:15,977 --> 00:32:15,969
&nbsp

1507
00:32:15,979 --> 00:32:19,204
Your foster father never forgave
himself for his mistakes.

1508
00:32:19,214 --> 00:32:19,206
&nbsp

1509
00:32:19,216 --> 00:32:21,940
That's why he took them out on you.

1510
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:21,942
&nbsp

1511
00:32:21,952 --> 00:32:23,842
He couldn't move forward.

1512
00:32:23,852 --> 00:32:25,412
&nbsp

1513
00:32:25,422 --> 00:32:27,479
But you can.

1514
00:32:27,489 --> 00:32:52,205
&nbsp

1515
00:32:52,215 --> 00:32:53,238
They did it.

1516
00:32:53,248 --> 00:33:02,618
&nbsp

1517
00:33:02,628 --> 00:33:05,050
I'm so sorry.

1518
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:05,052
&nbsp

1519
00:33:05,062 --> 00:33:06,718
It's okay.

1520
00:33:06,728 --> 00:33:06,720
&nbsp

1521
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:08,787
I'm so sorry.

1522
00:33:08,797 --> 00:33:08,789
&nbsp

1523
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,755
It's gonna be okay.

1524
00:33:10,765 --> 00:33:14,422
&nbsp

1525
00:33:14,432 --> 00:33:16,428
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.

1526
00:33:16,438 --> 00:33:24,584
&nbsp

1527
00:33:24,594 --> 00:33:26,587
So no one else got hurt?

1528
00:33:26,597 --> 00:33:26,589
&nbsp

1529
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:27,955
Luckily, no.

1530
00:33:27,965 --> 00:33:27,957
&nbsp

1531
00:33:27,967 --> 00:33:29,457
You don't have to worry about that.

1532
00:33:29,467 --> 00:33:29,459
&nbsp

1533
00:33:29,469 --> 00:33:31,158
What about John?

1534
00:33:31,168 --> 00:33:31,160
&nbsp

1535
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:33,728
The DA's prosecuting him
for what he did to you.

1536
00:33:33,738 --> 00:33:33,730
&nbsp

1537
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,763
So I think he's gonna be serving time,

1538
00:33:35,773 --> 00:33:35,765
&nbsp

1539
00:33:35,775 --> 00:33:40,234
and he's not gonna ever be
anybody's foster father again.

1540
00:33:40,244 --> 00:33:40,236
&nbsp

1541
00:33:40,246 --> 00:33:45,973
It's just so strange being
responsible for all of this

1542
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:45,975
&nbsp

1543
00:33:45,985 --> 00:33:47,909
and not remembering any of it.

1544
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:47,911
&nbsp

1545
00:33:47,921 --> 00:33:49,510
What do you remember

1546
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:49,512
&nbsp

1547
00:33:49,522 --> 00:33:52,113
about how you got your powers?

1548
00:33:52,123 --> 00:33:52,115
&nbsp

1549
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:53,932
How this all began?

1550
00:33:53,942 --> 00:33:55,118
&nbsp

1551
00:33:55,128 --> 00:33:56,918
Um...

1552
00:33:56,928 --> 00:33:56,920
&nbsp

1553
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:01,222
I started having dreams,
at night, of Magenta.

1554
00:34:01,232 --> 00:34:01,224
&nbsp

1555
00:34:01,234 --> 00:34:04,358
- Dreams?
- They were more than dreams.

1556
00:34:04,368 --> 00:34:04,360
&nbsp

1557
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:08,296
It was like I was living
another life or something.

1558
00:34:08,306 --> 00:34:08,726
&nbsp

1559
00:34:08,736 --> 00:34:11,183
And then I started getting
them all the time.

1560
00:34:11,193 --> 00:34:11,193
&nbsp

1561
00:34:11,203 --> 00:34:12,795
During the day.

1562
00:34:12,805 --> 00:34:13,060
&nbsp

1563
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:16,003
And the more it happened,

1564
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:16,005
&nbsp

1565
00:34:16,015 --> 00:34:19,507
the more painful they became.

1566
00:34:19,517 --> 00:34:19,509
&nbsp

1567
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:21,751
Then I started hearing a voice.

1568
00:34:21,761 --> 00:34:21,761
&nbsp

1569
00:34:21,771 --> 00:34:23,232
What voice?

1570
00:34:23,242 --> 00:34:23,461
&nbsp

1571
00:34:23,471 --> 00:34:24,946
It was a man.

1572
00:34:24,956 --> 00:34:24,948
&nbsp

1573
00:34:24,958 --> 00:34:26,827
Named Alchemy.

1574
00:34:26,837 --> 00:34:26,837
&nbsp

1575
00:34:26,847 --> 00:34:29,050
He said he could give me what I wanted

1576
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:29,052
&nbsp

1577
00:34:29,062 --> 00:34:31,519
and make me powerful again.

1578
00:34:31,529 --> 00:34:31,521
&nbsp

1579
00:34:31,531 --> 00:34:33,187
I didn't understand.

1580
00:34:33,197 --> 00:34:33,875
&nbsp

1581
00:34:33,885 --> 00:34:35,990
I thought I was going crazy.

1582
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:35,992
&nbsp

1583
00:34:36,002 --> 00:34:40,161
Trust me. Magenta is not here
because of anything that you did.

1584
00:34:40,171 --> 00:34:40,163
&nbsp

1585
00:34:40,173 --> 00:34:41,929
There may be a darkness inside of you,

1586
00:34:41,939 --> 00:34:41,931
&nbsp

1587
00:34:41,941 --> 00:34:44,131
but if you face it, it'll make it easier

1588
00:34:44,141 --> 00:34:44,133
&nbsp

1589
00:34:44,143 --> 00:34:46,258
for the good side of you to win.

1590
00:34:46,268 --> 00:34:46,540
&nbsp

1591
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,069
You're letting me go?

1592
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:48,071
&nbsp

1593
00:34:48,081 --> 00:34:50,538
None of this is your fault, Frankie.

1594
00:34:50,548 --> 00:34:50,540
&nbsp

1595
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:53,307
Caitlin found you a
good home in Keystone.

1596
00:34:53,317 --> 00:34:53,309
&nbsp

1597
00:34:53,319 --> 00:34:56,143
People that will never hurt you.

1598
00:34:56,153 --> 00:34:56,145
&nbsp

1599
00:34:56,155 --> 00:34:58,613
But what if Magenta tries to come back?

1600
00:34:58,623 --> 00:34:58,615
&nbsp

1601
00:34:58,625 --> 00:35:00,181
Fight her.

1602
00:35:00,191 --> 00:35:00,584
&nbsp

1603
00:35:00,594 --> 00:35:03,451
And if you need help, we'll be there.

1604
00:35:03,461 --> 00:35:03,453
&nbsp

1605
00:35:03,463 --> 00:35:07,321
We have faith in you, Frankie.

1606
00:35:07,331 --> 00:35:07,323
&nbsp

1607
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:08,556
Thank you.

1608
00:35:08,566 --> 00:35:10,554
&nbsp

1609
00:35:10,564 --> 00:35:12,293
Thank you all.

1610
00:35:12,303 --> 00:35:18,952
&nbsp

1611
00:35:18,962 --> 00:35:20,334
Are you okay?

1612
00:35:20,344 --> 00:35:20,336
&nbsp

1613
00:35:20,346 --> 00:35:21,336
Yeah.

1614
00:35:21,346 --> 00:35:21,816
&nbsp

1615
00:35:21,826 --> 00:35:23,037
Yeah, I...

1616
00:35:23,047 --> 00:35:23,039
&nbsp

1617
00:35:23,049 --> 00:35:25,573
I just feel bad for her, you know?

1618
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:26,509
&nbsp

1619
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:29,166
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1620
00:35:29,176 --> 00:35:30,013
&nbsp

1621
00:35:30,023 --> 00:35:32,680
- No dad cop required.
- Oh!

1622
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:32,682
&nbsp

1623
00:35:32,692 --> 00:35:33,981
You heard about that, huh?

1624
00:35:33,991 --> 00:35:33,983
&nbsp

1625
00:35:33,993 --> 00:35:36,584
Yeah, I heard about that.

1626
00:35:36,594 --> 00:35:40,356
&nbsp

1627
00:35:40,366 --> 00:35:41,816
Hey.

1628
00:35:41,826 --> 00:35:43,146
&nbsp

1629
00:35:43,156 --> 00:35:45,126
There she is.

1630
00:35:45,136 --> 00:35:45,128
&nbsp

1631
00:35:45,138 --> 00:35:46,927
You were tremendous out there.

1632
00:35:46,937 --> 00:35:47,218
&nbsp

1633
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:49,463
You really were.

1634
00:35:49,473 --> 00:35:49,465
&nbsp

1635
00:35:49,475 --> 00:35:52,466
I guess that's your first victory...

1636
00:35:52,476 --> 00:35:52,468
&nbsp

1637
00:35:52,478 --> 00:35:54,402
as a superhero.

1638
00:35:54,412 --> 00:35:56,072
&nbsp

1639
00:35:56,082 --> 00:35:57,972
My daughter.

1640
00:35:57,982 --> 00:35:58,484
&nbsp

1641
00:35:58,494 --> 00:36:00,174
Jesse Quick.

1642
00:36:00,184 --> 00:36:02,211
&nbsp

1643
00:36:02,221 --> 00:36:03,954
Yeah.

1644
00:36:03,964 --> 00:36:04,714
&nbsp

1645
00:36:04,724 --> 00:36:07,682
Yeah, well, I mean,
I was only able to do it

1646
00:36:07,692 --> 00:36:07,684
&nbsp

1647
00:36:07,694 --> 00:36:09,717
'cause you believed in me, so...

1648
00:36:09,727 --> 00:36:09,719
&nbsp

1649
00:36:09,729 --> 00:36:15,623
No, I should've been that way
a long, long time ago, but...

1650
00:36:15,633 --> 00:36:16,826
&nbsp

1651
00:36:16,836 --> 00:36:18,459
You know, one day, you'll understand.

1652
00:36:18,469 --> 00:36:18,461
&nbsp

1653
00:36:18,471 --> 00:36:20,773
I don't expect you to now, but...

1654
00:36:20,783 --> 00:36:21,654
&nbsp

1655
00:36:21,664 --> 00:36:23,431
but I'm always gonna worry.

1656
00:36:23,441 --> 00:36:24,634
&nbsp

1657
00:36:24,644 --> 00:36:27,501
I'm always going to be cautious.

1658
00:36:27,511 --> 00:36:28,971
&nbsp

1659
00:36:28,981 --> 00:36:31,439
I'm always going to love you.

1660
00:36:31,449 --> 00:36:33,776
&nbsp

1661
00:36:33,786 --> 00:36:35,409
Dad, I know.

1662
00:36:35,419 --> 00:36:35,411
&nbsp

1663
00:36:35,421 --> 00:36:38,145
I mean, of course I know.

1664
00:36:38,155 --> 00:36:44,287
&nbsp

1665
00:36:44,297 --> 00:36:46,721
And I will always love you.

1666
00:36:46,731 --> 00:36:46,723
&nbsp

1667
00:36:46,733 --> 00:36:48,723
Even when you drive me
absolutely insane.

1668
00:36:48,733 --> 00:36:54,597
&nbsp

1669
00:36:54,607 --> 00:36:55,930
So...

1670
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:55,932
&nbsp

1671
00:36:55,942 --> 00:36:57,085
So.

1672
00:36:57,095 --> 00:36:58,134
&nbsp

1673
00:36:58,144 --> 00:36:59,734
Are we going home or...

1674
00:36:59,744 --> 00:36:59,736
&nbsp

1675
00:36:59,746 --> 00:37:01,969
I think we'll stay for a few days,

1676
00:37:01,979 --> 00:37:01,971
&nbsp

1677
00:37:01,981 --> 00:37:06,974
run a few more tests,
and also to see if this fits you.

1678
00:37:06,984 --> 00:37:17,120
&nbsp

1679
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:21,140
Cisco did the insignia. Snow
thought this would help you, and...

1680
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:21,150
&nbsp

1681
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,723
I agree.

1682
00:37:22,733 --> 00:37:23,960
&nbsp

1683
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:26,193
- You do?
- I do.

1684
00:37:26,203 --> 00:37:27,296
&nbsp

1685
00:37:27,306 --> 00:37:28,713
My...

1686
00:37:28,723 --> 00:37:31,801
&nbsp

1687
00:37:31,811 --> 00:37:35,669
My fear... my guilt...

1688
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:35,671
&nbsp

1689
00:37:35,681 --> 00:37:38,572
has kept both of us back

1690
00:37:38,582 --> 00:37:38,574
&nbsp

1691
00:37:38,584 --> 00:37:40,678
for far too long.

1692
00:37:40,688 --> 00:37:42,044
&nbsp

1693
00:37:42,054 --> 00:37:44,378
You know you've always been my hero.

1694
00:37:44,388 --> 00:37:46,082
&nbsp

1695
00:37:46,092 --> 00:37:48,182
But now...

1696
00:37:48,192 --> 00:37:49,108
&nbsp

1697
00:37:49,118 --> 00:37:52,853
it's time for me to let you
be one for everyone else.

1698
00:37:52,863 --> 00:37:55,158
&nbsp

1699
00:37:55,168 --> 00:37:56,891
Thank you.

1700
00:37:56,901 --> 00:38:24,174
&nbsp

1701
00:38:24,184 --> 00:38:26,320
- Hey.
- Hey, you just made it.

1702
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:26,322
&nbsp

1703
00:38:26,332 --> 00:38:30,057
Yeah, I had to make
sure Frankie was okay.

1704
00:38:30,067 --> 00:38:31,327
&nbsp

1705
00:38:31,337 --> 00:38:33,627
So, are you ready to try this again?

1706
00:38:33,637 --> 00:38:33,629
&nbsp

1707
00:38:33,639 --> 00:38:35,896
Um... actually, I had a thought

1708
00:38:35,906 --> 00:38:35,898
&nbsp

1709
00:38:35,908 --> 00:38:40,067
about why our last date was so boring.

1710
00:38:40,077 --> 00:38:40,257
&nbsp

1711
00:38:40,267 --> 00:38:41,570
Oh, yeah?

1712
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:41,693
&nbsp

1713
00:38:41,703 --> 00:38:43,437
Yeah...

1714
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:44,540
&nbsp

1715
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:45,739
Here you go.

1716
00:38:45,749 --> 00:38:45,741
&nbsp

1717
00:38:45,751 --> 00:38:47,608
Um...

1718
00:38:47,618 --> 00:38:47,610
&nbsp

1719
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:51,111
So, I know that you think that
I shouldn't use my powers,

1720
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:51,113
&nbsp

1721
00:38:51,123 --> 00:38:53,380
and it's not that I'm
nothing without them,

1722
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:53,382
&nbsp

1723
00:38:53,392 --> 00:38:55,816
but they are a part of me now, you know?

1724
00:38:55,826 --> 00:38:55,818
&nbsp

1725
00:38:55,828 --> 00:38:57,327
They're part of you.

1726
00:38:57,337 --> 00:38:57,337
&nbsp

1727
00:38:57,347 --> 00:38:59,887
This is our life, and I think,

1728
00:38:59,897 --> 00:39:00,241
&nbsp

1729
00:39:00,251 --> 00:39:02,656
last date, we were
ignoring that part of us.

1730
00:39:02,666 --> 00:39:02,658
&nbsp

1731
00:39:02,668 --> 00:39:04,191
We were trying to be
the people that we were

1732
00:39:04,201 --> 00:39:04,193
&nbsp

1733
00:39:04,203 --> 00:39:06,494
before I was the Flash,

1734
00:39:06,504 --> 00:39:06,504
&nbsp

1735
00:39:06,514 --> 00:39:09,230
and that's why it wasn't working.

1736
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:09,836
&nbsp

1737
00:39:09,846 --> 00:39:13,400
Okay, so what are you saying?

1738
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:23,880
&nbsp

1739
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:27,527
I'm saying we have to stop
denying who we really are.

1740
00:39:27,537 --> 00:39:28,517
&nbsp

1741
00:39:28,527 --> 00:39:32,586
Well, yeah, I mean,
when you put it that way...

1742
00:39:32,596 --> 00:39:32,780
&nbsp

1743
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:34,822
I agree.

1744
00:39:34,832 --> 00:39:34,985
&nbsp

1745
00:39:34,995 --> 00:39:38,125
We can't pretend like none
of this has happened.

1746
00:39:38,135 --> 00:39:42,231
&nbsp

1747
00:39:42,241 --> 00:39:43,831
I thought you'd see it that way.

1748
00:39:43,841 --> 00:39:44,867
&nbsp

1749
00:39:44,877 --> 00:39:46,901
Sorry.

1750
00:39:46,911 --> 00:39:47,459
&nbsp

1751
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:49,637
It's Joe. He needs me at the station.

1752
00:39:49,647 --> 00:39:49,945
&nbsp

1753
00:39:49,955 --> 00:39:51,538
It's fine. Go.

1754
00:39:51,548 --> 00:39:52,033
&nbsp

1755
00:39:52,043 --> 00:39:54,475
- Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1756
00:39:54,485 --> 00:39:54,477
&nbsp

1757
00:39:54,487 --> 00:39:57,422
This has already been a
really amazing date...

1758
00:39:57,432 --> 00:39:57,432
&nbsp

1759
00:39:57,442 --> 00:39:59,313
Flash.

1760
00:39:59,323 --> 00:40:19,702
&nbsp

1761
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:21,635
- Hey, what's going on?
- There you are.

1762
00:40:21,645 --> 00:40:21,637
&nbsp

1763
00:40:21,647 --> 00:40:24,672
Listen, Singh wanted me
to show you guys this.

1764
00:40:24,682 --> 00:40:24,674
&nbsp

1765
00:40:24,684 --> 00:40:28,327
This happened a few days
ago at Iron Heights.

1766
00:40:28,337 --> 00:40:28,337
&nbsp

1767
00:40:28,347 --> 00:40:30,778
They tried to keep it under wraps 'cause
they didn't want anybody to think

1768
00:40:30,788 --> 00:40:30,780
&nbsp

1769
00:40:30,790 --> 00:40:34,682
there was a security issue,
but check it out.

1770
00:40:34,692 --> 00:40:35,048
&nbsp

1771
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:37,051
- That's Clariss.
- Alchemy!

1772
00:40:37,061 --> 00:40:37,053
&nbsp

1773
00:40:37,063 --> 00:40:38,218
It was Clariss.

1774
00:40:38,228 --> 00:40:38,220
&nbsp

1775
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:40,454
No! Aah! No! Stop!

1776
00:40:40,464 --> 00:40:43,491
&nbsp

1777
00:40:43,501 --> 00:40:45,125
Dead before he hit the ground.

1778
00:40:45,135 --> 00:40:47,064
&nbsp

1779
00:40:47,074 --> 00:40:48,390
Alchemy.

1780
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:48,972
&nbsp

1781
00:40:48,982 --> 00:40:51,365
You ever heard that name before?

1782
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:51,367
&nbsp

1783
00:40:51,377 --> 00:40:52,933
Alchemy?

1784
00:40:52,943 --> 00:40:52,935
&nbsp

1785
00:40:52,945 --> 00:40:54,802
No, I haven't.

1786
00:40:54,812 --> 00:40:54,804
&nbsp

1787
00:40:54,814 --> 00:40:56,904
Maybe there's an invisible meta.

1788
00:40:56,914 --> 00:40:56,906
&nbsp

1789
00:40:56,916 --> 00:40:59,373
Maybe it's a ghost.

1790
00:40:59,383 --> 00:40:59,375
&nbsp

1791
00:40:59,385 --> 00:41:01,442
Do you believe in ghosts, Allen?

1792
00:41:01,452 --> 00:41:02,945
&nbsp

1793
00:41:02,955 --> 00:41:04,445
No?

1794
00:41:04,455 --> 00:41:08,651
&nbsp

1795
00:41:08,661 --> 00:41:11,452
Hey, do you think this thing

1796
00:41:11,462 --> 00:41:11,454
&nbsp

1797
00:41:11,464 --> 00:41:14,121
is part of the Flashpoint timeline too?

1798
00:41:14,131 --> 00:41:14,876
&nbsp

1799
00:41:14,886 --> 00:41:17,826
I have a feeling a lot of
things are these days.
