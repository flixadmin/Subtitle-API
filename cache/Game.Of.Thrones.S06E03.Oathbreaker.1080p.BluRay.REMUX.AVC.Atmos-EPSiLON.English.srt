00:17:56,868 --> 00:18:01,539
You won't be here forever.
You won't be an old man in a tree.

168
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:06,461
But before you leave, you must learn.

169
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,130
Learn what?

170
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:11,383
Everything.

(OVERLAPPING CHATTER)

172
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:36,366
Hey, Great Khaleesi. Move your ass.

173
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,903
Welcome home, Khaleesi.

What are you doing?!

178
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:53,860
Take your hands off me!

179
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,528
I will have your heads!

180
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:18,385
You have made a mistake.

181
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:20,553
One you will regret.

182
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:22,263
I am the wife of the Great Khal.

183
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:23,765
We know who you are.

184
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:26,810
I remember you eating the stallion's heart.

185
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:32,774
Why didn't you come to us
after Khal Drogo died?

186
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:35,068
Because I am Daenerys Stormborn,

187
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,569
the Breaker of Chains,

188
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,738
the Queen of Meereen
and the Mother of Dragons.

189
00:20:38,822 --> 00:20:40,824
My place is not here with you.

190
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:43,493
You were the wife of the Great Khal.

191
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:48,248
You thought he would conquer the
world with you at his side.

192
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:49,791
He didn't.

193
00:20:51,334 --> 00:20:53,378
I was the wife of the Great Khal.

194
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,004
Khal Savo.

195
00:20:55,839 --> 00:21:00,969
I thought he would conquer the world
with me at his side.

196
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:05,098
You're young.

197
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:08,351
We were all young once.

198
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:11,688
But we all understand the way things are.

199
00:21:12,188 --> 00:21:14,190
You will learn as well,

200
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:17,235
if you are fortunate enough to stay with us.

201
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,571
Where else would I go?

202
00:21:20,572 --> 00:21:22,740
Every Khaleesi becomes Dosh Khaleen.

203
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:26,786
Yes. Immediately after the death of their khal.

204
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,621
But you went out into the world.

205
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:30,540
That is forbidden.

206
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:35,920
All the khalasars have returned
for the Khalar Vezhven.

207
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:42,051
They will decide which cities will be sacked
and which tribes will be enslaved.

208
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:46,723
And now they must decide what to do
with Khal Drogo's silver-haired widow.

209
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:50,685
With luck, your place will be here
with us, Mother of Dragons.

210
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:53,730
It is the best you can hope for, now.

211
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,203
I don't know how you stand it
in all that leather.

212
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,295
If we could have the room.

213
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:31,059
You look lovely today, my dear. You really do.

214
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:35,021
How you climbed all those steps
without breaking a sweat.

215
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:38,566
If you're going to torture me,
just call them back and get on with it.

216
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,151
I am not a torturer.

217
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:45,114
Though it so often is what people deserve.

218
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:49,869
And it does provide answers.

219
00:22:49,953 --> 00:22:52,997
But they're usually the wrong answers.

220
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:56,459
My job is to find the right answers.

221
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:58,628
Do you know how I do that?

222
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:01,047
I do it by making people happy.

223
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:04,342
I'd like to make you happy, Vala.

224
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:06,928
That's your name, isn't it? Vala.

225
00:23:07,762 --> 00:23:13,268
(CHUCKLES) That's all right.
I know who you are and what you've done.

226
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:16,771
You've done a lot.

227
00:23:16,854 --> 00:23:20,858
You've sacrificed your body for a cause,
which is more than most people do.

228
00:23:23,486 --> 00:23:28,575
And you've helped the Sons of the Harpy
murder the Unsullied and the Second Sons.

229
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:32,579
The Unsullied and the Second Sons
are foreign soldiers,

230
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:36,040
brought here by a foreign queen
to destroy our city and our history.

231
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:39,210
I understand.

232
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:43,756
Well, that makes perfect sense
from your perspective.

233
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:48,970
I have a different perspective, of course.

234
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:52,890
I think it's important that you try to see things
from my perspective,

235
00:23:52,974 --> 00:23:55,101
just as I will try to see them from yours.

236
00:23:56,185 --> 00:24:00,440
Because that is the only way
that I can make you and Dom happy.

237
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,738
That is how you pronounce it, "Dom"?

238
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:10,366
I'm afraid I don't really speak the language.

239
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:14,203
Such a handsome boy.

240
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:17,832
Those big, brown eyes.
Good luck keeping the ladies away.

241
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,502
Yes, you're a true liberator, aren't you?

242
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:25,006
You won't torture me,
you'll just threaten my son.

243
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:27,216
Children are blameless.

244
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:29,886
I have never hurt them.

245
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:34,474
Your boy is in no immediate danger,
this I swear to you.

246
00:24:37,018 --> 00:24:41,939
But between us, dear,
you did conspire to kill the queen's soldiers.

247
00:24:42,023 --> 00:24:44,150
We both know the penalty for that crime.

248
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:53,701
How will poor Dom get on
without his mother?

249
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:55,578
And with his breathing problem.

250
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:57,455
If I tell you anything, they'll kill me.

251
00:24:58,498 --> 00:25:00,291
So either you kill me or they do.

252
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:03,378
Yes, from your perspective, this is a problem.

253
00:25:05,588 --> 00:25:07,632
There is a third option, though.

254
00:25:07,715 --> 00:25:10,885
A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos.

255
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:14,681
I've already booked passage
for a woman and her young son.

256
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:19,227
I'll even throw in a bag of silver
to help you start again.

257
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:22,855
Though I'm afraid we'll have to ask
one of our leather-clad friends

258
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:24,190
back in to carry it.

259
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:26,359
Far too heavy for me.

260
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,654
The boat sails at dawn.

261
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:32,615
You need to decide now.

262
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:36,411
A new life for you and Dom, or...

263
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:56,973
What should we do while we wait?
To pass the time, what should we do?

264
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:58,641
What should we talk about?

265
00:26:02,145 --> 00:26:03,730
You speak 19 languages.

266
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:06,357
You must occasionally use some of them
to talk about things.

267
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:09,777
You two, you spend
a great deal of time together.

268
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:12,780
What would you be talking about
if I weren't here?

269
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:15,491
Patrol.

270
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,287
When I am going on patrol with the Unsullied.

271
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:23,833
What we see on patrol.
Who we captured on patrol.

272
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:26,294
That's good. That's very good.

273
00:26:28,838 --> 00:26:33,426
But that's a report.
I was thinking more of a conversation.

274
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:36,637
A wise man once said,
"The true history of the world

275
00:26:36,721 --> 00:26:40,016
"is the history of great conversations
in elegant rooms."

276
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:42,351
Who said this?

277
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:45,688
Me. Just now.

278
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:56,574
All right, no conversations. Let's play a game.

279
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:01,913
You don't play games?
Either one of you, ever?

280
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:03,164
Games are for children.

281
00:27:03,247 --> 00:27:06,709
My master Kraznys
would sometimes make us play games.

282
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:08,669
There, that's a start.

283
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:10,713
Only the girls.

284
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:12,131
Oh... No, no, no.

285
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:14,884
Not that. Of course, not that.

286

Innocent games. Fun games. Drinking games.

287

MISSANDEI: We do not drink.

288
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:23,768
Until you do.

289
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:30,358
All right. No drinking.
We can play without drinking.

290
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:33,861
It's a wonderful game. I invented it.
Here's how it works.

291
00:27:33,945 --> 00:27:37,532
I make a statement about your past.
If I'm wrong, I drink.

292
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,283
And if I'm right...

(GASPS)

294
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:43,079

who funds the Sons of the Harpy.

Some things you can't rush.

00:27:55,758 --> 00:27:56,801
You found out?

00:27:56,884 --> 00:28:00,972
The Good Masters of Astapor
and the Wise Masters of Yunkai.

302
00:28:01,514 --> 00:28:04,350
With help from their friends in Volantis.

TYRION: You see?

304
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:08,563
You don't even have to worry
about the local rebellion.

305
00:28:08,646 --> 00:28:12,233
We only have to worry about
the three rich foreign cities paying for it.

306
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:16,153
We conquered Astapor and Yunkai once.
We will do it again and execute the Masters.

307
00:28:16,237 --> 00:28:19,282
If the Unsullied march off to
re-conquer Astapor and Yunkai,

308
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:21,033
who will remain to defend
the free people of Meereen?

309
00:28:21,117 --> 00:28:23,452
If we do not fight them,
how can we stop them?

310
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:25,413
We cannot.

311
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:27,790
The Masters speak only one language.

312
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:32,169
They spoke it to me for many years.
I know it better than my mother tongue.

313
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:35,214
If we want them to hear us,
we must speak it back to them.

314
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,925
May it be the last thing they ever hear.

315
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:40,469
You may be right.

316
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:42,388
So we will fight them?

317
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:44,015
- Possibly.
- Possibly?

to the Good Masters of Astapor,
the Wise Masters of Yunkai,

and benevolent enslavers of Volantis?

QYBURN: Your eye looks much better, Arthur.

325
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,168
How's your mother's jaw?

326
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:13,669
Better.

327
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,630
And your father?

328
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:17,924
No one's seen him.

329
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:21,052
And no one will.
That worked out rather nicely.

330
00:29:21,135 --> 00:29:23,012
Will Lord Varys ever come back?

331
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:24,680
I don't think so.

332
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:27,016
Do you miss him?

333
00:29:27,808 --> 00:29:28,851
He was nice.

334
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:33,856
He called us his little birds.
He gave us sweets.

335
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:38,069
It's funny you should mention that.

336
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:43,658
Guess what I happened to find today.

337
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:47,411
Candied plums from Dorne.

338

(LAUGHING)

339
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,292
Now remember,

340
00:29:53,376 --> 00:29:57,505
if any of your friends like sweets or need help,
they can always come to me.

341
00:29:57,588 --> 00:30:01,676
All I need in return are whispers.

(DOOR OPENS)

343
00:30:09,392 --> 00:30:10,893
QYBURN: No need to be afraid.

344
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:15,189
This is Ser Gregor.
He's friends with all my friends.

345
00:30:21,112 --> 00:30:22,321
Run along now.

- (DOOR CLOSES)
- Varys's little birds?

347
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:31,414
Your little birds now, Your Grace.

348
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:33,374
What did you do to him exactly?

349
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:35,292
I haven't been able to get a clear answer.

350
00:30:35,376 --> 00:30:37,211
Oh, a number of things.

351
00:30:37,294 --> 00:30:38,713
Does he understand what we're saying?

352
00:30:38,796 --> 00:30:43,384
I mean, to the extent that he ever understood
complete sentences in the first place.

353
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:47,263
He understands well enough.

354
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:49,432
So tell him to march into the Sept

355
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:52,268
and crush the High Sparrow's head
like a melon.

356
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:55,604
The High Sparrow has hundreds
of Faith Militant surrounding him.

357
00:30:55,855 --> 00:30:59,608
Ser Gregor can't face them all.
And he won't have to.

358
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:01,902
He'll only have to face one.

359
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:06,574
Has the Faith leveled official charges yet?

360
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:07,908
Not yet.

361
00:31:08,617 --> 00:31:11,704
That is one trial by combat
I look forward to watching.

362
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:13,539
Don't stop at the city.

363
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:18,794
I want little birds in Dorne,
in Highgarden, in the North.

364
00:31:19,295 --> 00:31:21,964
If someone is planning on
making our losses their gains,

365
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:23,215
I want to hear it.

366
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:26,719
If someone is laughing at the queen

367
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:29,513
who walked naked through
the streets covered in shit,

368
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:31,265
I want to hear.

369
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:35,686
I want to know who they are.
I want to know where they are.

Qyburn is worse.

I told them all. I told them.
He's arrogant, dangerous.

372
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:53,329
You don't get thrown out of the Citadel
without good reason.

373
00:31:53,746 --> 00:31:57,249
And no one listened to my advice.
So here we are.

374
00:31:57,416 --> 00:32:01,003
And what he's done to Gregor Clegane
is an abomination.

375
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:04,673
We never sanctioned this experiment.

376
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:07,510
And I, for one,
think it would be in our best interest

00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:08,969
to have the beast...

- I was invited, my dear,

381
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:24,401
to help deal with several troublesome issues,
such as the queen's imprisonment.

382
00:32:24,652 --> 00:32:26,487
Thank you for bringing it up.

383
00:32:27,238 --> 00:32:30,699
It's well past time we addressed
the abuses I endured.

384
00:32:31,325 --> 00:32:33,119
Margaery is the queen.

385
00:32:33,202 --> 00:32:37,081
You are not the queen
because you're not married to the king.

386
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:41,544
I do appreciate these things
can get a bit confusing in your family.

387
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:47,091
This is a Small Council meeting.
You have no position on the Small Council.

388
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:49,093
I'm the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.

389
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:52,429
The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard
does have a position on the Small Council.

390
00:32:52,513 --> 00:32:55,391
Grand Maester Pycelle,
would you sanction that statement?

391
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:57,059
Well, uh... (MUTTERS)

392
00:32:57,226 --> 00:33:02,314
I would say Ser Gerold Hightower
had a seat on the Mad King's council.

393
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:04,942
Of course, that was the Mad King.

394
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:07,236
King Robert saw things differently.
And King...

395
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,576
What about Myrcella's death, Uncle?

396
00:33:14,952 --> 00:33:18,289
Do you consider the murder
of your own blood a troublesome issue?

397
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:21,125
The same women who murdered Myrcella

398
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:23,502
have overthrown House Martell
and taken control of Dorne.

399
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,589
We've got a lot to discuss. All of us, together.

400
00:33:28,841 --> 00:33:31,510
And seeing as you cannot make us leave,
we best get on with it.

401
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:38,350
No, we cannot make you leave.
And you cannot make us stay.

402
00:33:39,935 --> 00:33:42,938
Not unless you're gonna have
that thing murder us all.

her daughter's final resting place.

406
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:34,573
Ah, I'm sorry, Your Grace.
That's not possible. Not yet.

407
00:34:34,657 --> 00:34:36,325
When will it be possible?

408
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:38,327
When she's fully atoned for her sins.

409
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:41,830
You cut off her hair
and marched her naked through the streets

410
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:43,749
in front of the whole city.

411
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:45,459
That wasn't the full atonement?

412
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:47,086
No.

413
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:52,967
She must stand trial before seven septons,
so we can learn the true extent of her sins.

414
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:57,054
I want you to
let her see Myrcella's resting place.

And what does that mean to you?

418

It means a great deal to me.

419
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:09,984
The Crown and the Faith
are the twin pillars of the world.

420
00:35:10,651 --> 00:35:11,986
Do you know who told me that?

421
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:15,239
Your mother.

422
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:17,324
My mother who is unclean?

423
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:21,120
My mother who still needs to atone
after all you've put her through?

424
00:35:40,723 --> 00:35:43,225
How do you think the Mother Above
first came to us?

425
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:49,565
How did men and women first come to
feel the Mother's presence, hmm?

426
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:52,776
It was through their own mothers.

427
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:59,241
There's a great deal of falsehood in Cersei.
You know that.

428
00:35:59,325 --> 00:36:03,329
But when she speaks of you,
the Mother's love outshines it all.

429
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:10,502
Her love for you is more real
than anything else in this world

430
00:36:10,586 --> 00:36:12,379
because it doesn't come from this world.

431
00:36:14,006 --> 00:36:15,424
But you know that.

432
00:36:16,342 --> 00:36:17,968
You've felt it.

433
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:20,262
You've seen her when she talks to you.

434
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:24,600
Yes.

435
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:27,728

When your mother
made her walk of atonement,

443
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:55,089
she did it to get back to you.

444
00:36:55,756 --> 00:36:58,050
I still don't understand
why you want to put her

445

through any more than she's already endured.

It's not what I want. It's what the gods want.

447
00:37:03,806 --> 00:37:07,976
They make their will known to us,
and it's up to us to either accept or reject it.

Please.

If we're to be just and good, then we accept it.
All of us, even kings.

My grandfather once said something similar.

Except for the part about the gods.

454

The gods worked through him
whether he knew it or not.

As they work through your mother.

00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:40,796
ARYA: Arya Stark left him to die.
He was on her list.

483
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:45,717
He was not on her list anymore.

484
00:39:47,386 --> 00:39:48,845
She had taken him off it.

485
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:52,474
Why? Didn't she want him dead any longer?

486
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,397
ARYA: She did and she did not.

487
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:04,653
She sounds confused.

488
00:40:10,576 --> 00:40:13,537
Yes, she was.

489
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,211
Who else was on Arya Stark's funny little list?

490
00:40:21,295 --> 00:40:22,796
(GROANING)

491
00:40:23,005 --> 00:40:24,172
ARYA: Cersei Lannister.

492
00:40:25,966 --> 00:40:27,134
Gregor Clegane.

493
00:40:29,011 --> 00:40:30,178
Walder Frey.

494
00:40:34,308 --> 00:40:35,517
WAIF: That's a short list.

495
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:42,941
That can't be everyone you want to kill.

496
00:40:46,445 --> 00:40:48,155
Are you sure you're not forgetting someone?

497
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:54,036
Which name would you like a girl to speak?

498
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:59,750
(BOTH GRUNTING)

499
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,713
(YELLING)

500
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:34,159
JAQEN: If a girl tells me her name,
I will give her eyes back.

501
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:39,915
A girl has no name.

502
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:45,754
Come.

503
00:42:18,787 --> 00:42:22,416
If a girl is truly no one,
she has nothing to fear.

504
00:42:49,151 --> 00:42:50,402
Who are you?

505
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:55,657
No one.

506
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:08,795
The Umbers are a famously loyal house.

507
00:43:08,879 --> 00:43:11,006
Famously loyal to the Starks.

508
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:13,675
And you, Lord Karstark,

509
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:17,596
your people share blood
with the Starks, don't they?

510
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:20,056
But here we are. Times change.

511
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:24,811
When my father became Warden of the North,
your house refused to pledge their banners.

512
00:43:24,895 --> 00:43:26,146
Your father was a cunt.

513
00:43:30,025 --> 00:43:31,777
My beloved father, the Warden...

514
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,946
Your father was a cunt,
and that's why you killed him.

515
00:43:36,531 --> 00:43:38,283
I might have done the same to my father

516
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:40,786
if he hadn't have done me
the favor of dying on his own.

517
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:43,371
My father was poisoned by our enemies.

518
00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:45,165
Mmm.

519
00:43:46,166 --> 00:43:49,085
Why have you come to Winterfell,
Lord Umber?

520
00:43:49,169 --> 00:43:53,423
The bastard Jon Snow
led an army of wildlings past the Wall.

521
00:43:53,507 --> 00:43:55,425
We're farther north than any of you fuckers.

522
00:43:55,926 --> 00:43:58,887
Wildlings come down,
we always have to fight them first.

523
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,723
I like fighting wildlings.
Been doing it all me life.

524
00:44:02,557 --> 00:44:04,851
But there are too many of them
for us to beat back alone.

525
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,479
So now you've come seeking help?

526
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:10,357
We need to help each other.

527
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:14,444
The colder it gets, the farther south
those goat-fuckers will roam.

528
00:44:14,528 --> 00:44:15,779
Won't take them long to get here.

529
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:18,657
You think a horde of wildlings
can take Winterfell?

530
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:22,619
If they get Jon Snow leading them, maybe.
He knows this place better than we ever will.

531
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:31,211
Pledge your banners to House Bolton,
swear loyalty to me as Warden of the North,

532
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:32,462
and we will fight together

533
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:35,257
to destroy the bastard
and all his wildling friends.

534
00:44:35,423 --> 00:44:37,259
I'm not kissing your fucking hand.

535
00:44:37,801 --> 00:44:40,428
Traditionally a bannerman
kneels before his lord.

536
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:42,180
I'm not doing that either.

537
00:44:42,264 --> 00:44:45,016
Why would I trust a man
who won't honor tradition?

538
00:44:45,684 --> 00:44:48,061
Your father honored tradition.

539
00:44:49,187 --> 00:44:53,149
Knelt for Robb Stark.
Called him King of the North.

540
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:55,443
Was Robb Stark right to trust your father?

541
00:44:55,527 --> 00:44:57,654
Then it appears we're at a bit of an impasse.

542
00:44:57,737 --> 00:45:01,950
Fuck kneeling and fuck oaths.
I've got a gift for you.

543
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:07,956
A girl, I hope. I prefer redheads.

544
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:10,166
A girl, aye.

545
00:45:11,001 --> 00:45:12,627
(SMALLJON LAUGHS)

546
00:45:12,711 --> 00:45:13,879
A wild one.

547
00:45:22,429 --> 00:45:23,680
I like them wild.

548
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:28,059
And a boy, nice and young.

549
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:30,103
The way Karstark likes them.

550
00:45:32,772 --> 00:45:34,733
(PANTING)

551
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:39,821
- Who's this?
- Rickon Stark.

552
00:45:47,913 --> 00:45:49,539
How do I know that's Rickon Stark?

553
00:46:20,862 --> 00:46:23,406
Welcome home, Lord Stark.

554
00:46:27,661 --> 00:46:29,079
(POUNDING ON DOOR)

555
00:46:35,043 --> 00:46:36,169
It's time.

556
00:47:14,541 --> 00:47:17,711
If you have any last words, now is the time.

557
00:47:17,794 --> 00:47:20,338
You shouldn't be alive. It's not right.

558
00:47:23,133 --> 00:47:24,426
Neither was killing me.

559
00:47:28,972 --> 00:47:33,059
My mother's still living at White Harbor.
Could you write her?

560
00:47:33,935 --> 00:47:35,478
Tell her I died fighting the wildlings.

561
00:47:44,738 --> 00:47:48,533
I had a choice, Lord Commander.

562
00:47:48,616 --> 00:47:52,620
Betray you or betray the Night's Watch.

563
00:47:52,704 --> 00:47:55,123
You brought an army of wildlings
into our lands.

564
00:47:57,375 --> 00:48:00,253
An army of murderers and raiders.

565
00:48:00,336 --> 00:48:04,382
If I had to do it all over
knowing where I'd end up,

566
00:48:04,466 --> 00:48:07,385
I pray I'd make the right choice again.

567
00:48:07,844 --> 00:48:09,429
I'm sure you would, Ser Alliser.

568
00:48:09,512 --> 00:48:12,307
I fought, I lost.

569
00:48:15,143 --> 00:48:16,352
Now I rest.

570
00:48:17,437 --> 00:48:20,398
But you, Lord Snow,

571
00:48:21,566 --> 00:48:23,818
you'll be fighting their battles forever.

572
00:48:58,937 --> 00:49:01,856
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

573
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:26,047
(CHOKING, GASPING)

574
00:50:11,259 --> 00:50:12,552
We should burn the bodies.

575
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:15,763
You should.

576
00:50:25,273 --> 00:50:27,442
What do you want me to do with this?

577
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:29,736
Wear it. Burn it.

578
00:50:31,196 --> 00:50:32,488
Whatever you want.

579
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:34,908
You have Castle Black.

580
00:50:42,123 --> 00:50:43,416
My watch is ended.
