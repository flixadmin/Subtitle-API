1
00:00:04,316 --> 00:00:07,024
Okay. That's a $150 additional charge.

2
00:00:07,853 --> 00:00:09,196
You're talking to the wrong guy.

3
00:00:09,254 --> 00:00:10,392
That's a little out of my price range.

4
00:00:10,455 --> 00:00:13,299
It includes scalp treatment, reflexology.

5
00:00:13,358 --> 00:00:15,235
How much is it to tickle my pickle?

6
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,798
To yank my crank?
To give me a ho-jo to go?

7
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:22,004
Sweetheart, I'm not asking
for a finger up the ass.

8
00:00:22,067 --> 00:00:24,343
I just want you to just jerk it a little bit.

9
00:00:24,803 --> 00:00:27,215
Donny, this isn't a brothel.

10
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:31,577
Then I'm completely confused
what the fuck we're doing here right now!

11
00:00:31,843 --> 00:00:34,084
So, what, you're just going to
get a hand job in front of all of us?

12
00:00:34,713 --> 00:00:35,783
I don't know. Am I?

13
00:00:37,749 --> 00:00:39,160
I guess not!

14
00:00:39,651 --> 00:00:42,655
You know, I have worked
very hard on this night, Don,

15
00:00:43,155 --> 00:00:44,930
and you're being just plain rude.

16
00:00:45,357 --> 00:00:47,428
- Phil, no! Phil!
- No, no. Don't do this.

17
00:00:50,228 --> 00:00:52,572
Nice. That's nice.

18
00:00:52,964 --> 00:00:56,036
That's good. That's good.

19
00:00:57,002 --> 00:00:58,242
It tickles.

20
00:00:58,303 --> 00:01:00,078
Just fight through it, man. It's worth it.

21
00:01:00,138 --> 00:01:02,778
If you stop, I swear I will kill you.

22
00:01:08,613 --> 00:01:10,524
You know what,
if I don't see a tit in five minutes,

23
00:01:10,582 --> 00:01:11,890
I'm going to strangle this motherfucker.

24
00:01:12,317 --> 00:01:15,890
You should be ashamed of yourself
for fucking arranging this bullshit!

25
00:01:16,354 --> 00:01:17,924
Well, I feel very relaxed,

26
00:01:17,989 --> 00:01:20,265
and I think this was
a good use of a Groupon.

27
00:01:20,525 --> 00:01:22,095
You fucked us, buddy!

28
00:01:22,761 --> 00:01:25,298
Five more minutes till you
get to choose amongst four

29
00:01:25,363 --> 00:01:27,707
artisanal house-blended
chocolates, gentlemen.

30
00:01:29,668 --> 00:01:31,204
We can't let tonight end like this, boys.

31
00:01:31,269 --> 00:01:32,339
We got to go out.

32
00:01:32,437 --> 00:01:34,576
I'm telling you, I can't let my son have a...

33
00:01:34,706 --> 00:01:38,347
My son of a gun best friend
have his bachelor party be this.

34
00:01:38,677 --> 00:01:41,521
You fucking... You guys got your
face covered in leprechaun shit.

35
00:01:42,214 --> 00:01:43,852
We should be getting whacked off,

36
00:01:43,915 --> 00:01:45,917
all of us, as a fucking team!

37
00:01:46,718 --> 00:01:49,722
Donny, I think
we've had enough excitement for one night.

38
00:01:50,155 --> 00:01:53,034
Besides, it's not like you can throw
together a whole other party this late.

39
00:01:53,124 --> 00:01:57,129
I could have six chicks making out
with each other on our laps in 10 minutes.

40
00:01:57,963 --> 00:01:59,374
I could stay out a little later.

41
00:01:59,998 --> 00:02:00,999
Bam!

42
00:02:01,466 --> 00:02:04,140
We gonna get our dicks sucked.

43
00:02:05,036 --> 00:02:06,106
There it is.

44
00:02:06,204 --> 00:02:08,707
Unless, Mrs. Ravensdale,
you want to whip them knockers out?

45
00:02:08,773 --> 00:02:09,808
We'd love to see them.

46
00:02:09,941 --> 00:02:10,976
All right, you know what?

47
00:02:11,042 --> 00:02:14,080
You are an imbecilic,
immature, asinine, childish,

48
00:02:14,145 --> 00:02:16,682
caveman-like, hairy-knuckled,
single-chromosomal,

49
00:02:16,748 --> 00:02:19,251
obnoxious, uneducated, ignorant asshole

50
00:02:19,317 --> 00:02:22,093
who I would like to fuck hard and long!

51
00:02:23,488 --> 00:02:24,899
So, I'm going to go put a dent in that.

52
00:02:24,956 --> 00:02:26,560
You guys get that green jizz off your face.

53
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:27,695
I'll be back in 20.

54
00:02:28,059 --> 00:02:29,163
We're going out, boys!

55
00:02:29,728 --> 00:02:31,435
Hey, this is the shit,
this place, I'm telling you.

56
00:02:31,496 --> 00:02:33,840
The hottest chicks, the best Denver omelets.

57
00:02:33,898 --> 00:02:35,070
- You have to eat one.
- All right.

58
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:37,135
- Donny!
- Yeah, this is who I was telling you about!

59
00:02:37,202 --> 00:02:38,738
- What's up? Give me that.
- I'm so happy to see you.

60
00:02:38,803 --> 00:02:40,646
- You look so fucking cute!
- I know, right?

61
00:02:41,473 --> 00:02:44,647
And you brought a military man.

62
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:46,279
What's your name, soldier?

63
00:02:46,444 --> 00:02:48,981
Chad Martin, private first class,
United States Marine Corps.

64
00:02:49,281 --> 00:02:52,455
You think you can keep that dick
at attention for a couple hours?

65
00:02:52,517 --> 00:02:53,655
That's an order!

66
00:02:54,753 --> 00:02:55,857
Already on it.

67
00:02:56,688 --> 00:02:57,826
Look at my man!

68
00:02:57,889 --> 00:03:00,199
You guys, let me get in here
and introduce myself.

69
00:03:00,258 --> 00:03:02,431
Hello. I'm Phil.
I'm married with four children,

70
00:03:02,494 --> 00:03:05,441
and I have actually
only seen three vaginae in my entire life:

71
00:03:05,497 --> 00:03:06,703
my wife's, my baby's

72
00:03:06,765 --> 00:03:09,905
and my aunt's once by accident
on the back of a tandem bike.

73
00:03:10,368 --> 00:03:12,507
Well, here's number four, baby!

74
00:03:13,438 --> 00:03:16,009
I'm going to count that
as numbers four and five.

75
00:03:37,095 --> 00:03:39,268
<i>Champale would like to dedicate this</i>

76
00:03:39,331 --> 00:03:41,538
<i>to Mr. Todd Peterson.</i>

77
00:03:43,268 --> 00:03:44,804
- Yeah, baby. Yeah.
- Here you go.

78
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:47,341
Oh, hey.

79
00:03:47,405 --> 00:03:48,509
Do you want any eggs?

80
00:03:48,573 --> 00:03:50,883
No. I really have to watch what I eat.

81
00:03:50,942 --> 00:03:52,580
No fatty foods. But thank you.

82
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:54,051
I'm Brie.

83
00:03:54,112 --> 00:03:55,523
I'm Todd. Nice to meet you.

84
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,459
I know who you are, Han Solo.

85
00:03:59,818 --> 00:04:01,058
No, you can't...

86
00:04:01,119 --> 00:04:02,894
Don't worry, your secret's safe.

87
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:35,889
Who did that?

88
00:05:08,653 --> 00:05:10,462
- Gerald, get in the car.
- I love you, Donny!

89
00:05:10,522 --> 00:05:11,592
Yeah, I love you. Get in there.

90
00:05:11,656 --> 00:05:13,101
Man, you got to give me the recipe, man.

91
00:05:13,158 --> 00:05:14,728
Can't buy everything, Spirou!

92
00:05:14,793 --> 00:05:16,363
Bro, but they use olive oil, not butter.

93
00:05:16,428 --> 00:05:17,498
That's the big secret.

94
00:05:17,562 --> 00:05:18,870
Okay, Chris, get him in there.

95
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,240
Be gentle, he's protecting our country.

96
00:05:21,332 --> 00:05:22,402
All right, good night, guys!

97
00:05:24,235 --> 00:05:26,545
Gerald, you're a sick man, buddy!

98
00:05:26,704 --> 00:05:27,978
Whoa.

99
00:05:28,072 --> 00:05:30,177
Hey, what... Where's everybody going?

100
00:05:30,241 --> 00:05:31,811
I sent them home, guy.

101
00:05:31,876 --> 00:05:33,981
I thought we could have a little

102
00:05:34,045 --> 00:05:36,753
best manlgroom alone time.

103
00:05:37,215 --> 00:05:38,523
But shouldn't I go with them?

104
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,426
'Cause Jamie's gonna get mad at me.

105
00:05:40,785 --> 00:05:41,957
Easy, guy.

106
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:46,162
You're gonna have plenty of time
for her to be mad at you when you're married.

107
00:05:47,725 --> 00:05:50,706
I got you a wedding gift,
and I want to give it to you alone, all right?

108
00:05:50,762 --> 00:05:51,832
You got me a gift?

109
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:53,204
Of course I got you.

110
00:05:53,264 --> 00:05:55,767
And I think you might dig it.

111
00:06:00,872 --> 00:06:01,907
An earring.

112
00:06:02,373 --> 00:06:06,753
Yeah, I know, but that's an earring
that your mom gave me,

113
00:06:06,811 --> 00:06:09,257
and I thought maybe we could
keep it in the family, you know?

114
00:06:09,314 --> 00:06:12,591
Just kind of keep it going,
generation to generation, actually.

115
00:06:14,586 --> 00:06:16,862
Yeah, but I don't have a pierced ear, Donny.

116
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:18,895
Yeah.

117
00:06:20,158 --> 00:06:21,262
No.

118
00:06:21,893 --> 00:06:23,099
Yeah.

119
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,336
All right, fuck it, fuck it.

120
00:06:27,398 --> 00:06:28,604
Do it, just do it.

121
00:06:29,234 --> 00:06:30,269
It's not gonna hurt, buddy.

122
00:06:30,335 --> 00:06:31,609
You got a nice buzz going.

123
00:06:31,669 --> 00:06:32,977
Yeah, I got it, I got it.

124
00:06:33,037 --> 00:06:34,277
Hang on.

125
00:06:34,572 --> 00:06:35,812
Yeah.

126
00:06:35,907 --> 00:06:36,908
Liquor it up.

127
00:06:36,975 --> 00:06:38,283
Fuck!

128
00:06:38,343 --> 00:06:39,686
Come here. Come here.

129
00:06:40,945 --> 00:06:42,788
Hang in there! Go ahead, just sit still, homie.

130
00:06:45,016 --> 00:06:46,256
Yeah!

131
00:06:48,086 --> 00:06:49,360
How we doing?

132
00:06:49,754 --> 00:06:50,755
Oh, God.

133
00:06:50,822 --> 00:06:52,733
That's it. That's the way to man up.

134
00:06:53,258 --> 00:06:54,999
- That wasn't so bad.
- Let me see it.

135
00:06:55,593 --> 00:06:57,197
Am I bleeding?

136
00:06:59,163 --> 00:07:00,437
- I don't think so.
- No?

137
00:07:00,899 --> 00:07:02,139
Does it look good?

138
00:07:02,233 --> 00:07:04,975
You look like you could be playing
drums for Foreigner or some shit.

139
00:07:05,036 --> 00:07:06,140
You look like a bad-ass.

140
00:07:06,437 --> 00:07:07,973
- Really?
- Yeah.

141
00:07:08,172 --> 00:07:10,482
'Cause it makes me feel kind of...

142
00:07:11,442 --> 00:07:12,682
Dangerous.

143
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:16,119
There he is, man!

144
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,922
That's your personality,
like when you were seven years old,

145
00:07:19,017 --> 00:07:22,260
me and Uncle Vanny used to
laugh our asses off from you.

146
00:07:22,887 --> 00:07:24,696
Uncle Vanny, that's right.

147
00:07:25,223 --> 00:07:26,497
What happened to that guy?

148
00:07:27,158 --> 00:07:29,104
Dude, you know what it's time for?

149
00:07:29,494 --> 00:07:32,304
To get you back together with the old gang.

150
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:34,838
Come on.

151
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:36,913
I just hope the guy will talk to me.

152
00:07:37,368 --> 00:07:38,472
Phil!

153
00:07:38,536 --> 00:07:40,743
Come on, you're gonna get arrested, buddy.

154
00:07:41,472 --> 00:07:43,509
I shouldn't be doing this.

155
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,150
No, don't stop, don't stop.

156
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,432
All right, look.
I came here to tell you I'm sorry

157
00:08:01,526 --> 00:08:03,972
about what happened
with me and your mother.

158
00:08:04,495 --> 00:08:07,339
It was an accident,
and it will never happen again.

159
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,010
That's all I've been waiting for
all these years, man, a simple apology.

160
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,276
It's water under the bridge.

161
00:08:13,338 --> 00:08:14,715
Don't sweat it. Holla.

162
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,951
Wait, are you Vanilla Ice?

163
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,420
Was Uncle Vanny Vanilla Ice this whole time?

164
00:08:21,613 --> 00:08:22,751
'Who did you think I was?

165
00:08:22,814 --> 00:08:26,159
I don't know, a friend of my dad's
that wore a lot of parachute pants?

166
00:08:26,985 --> 00:08:28,055
Man.

167
00:08:28,119 --> 00:08:29,723
I want to be honest with you, too.

168
00:08:30,054 --> 00:08:32,557
I never did knock boots with your mother.

169
00:08:32,957 --> 00:08:34,061
- No?
- No.

170
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,729
I think she whacked me off outside the pants.

171
00:08:36,361 --> 00:08:37,965
- No.
- But I didn't finish.

172
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:39,736
- Vanny, I didn't finish. I couldn't.
- Yeah?

173
00:08:39,998 --> 00:08:41,705
- Mom.
- Yeah.

174
00:08:41,766 --> 00:08:43,040
You know, she did like to fuck.

175
00:08:43,501 --> 00:08:44,571
That's fucking... Look at him.

176
00:08:44,636 --> 00:08:46,343
Back to it. Fuck, yeah.

177
00:08:46,571 --> 00:08:48,050
Hey, Han Solo, you're looking great, man.

178
00:08:48,106 --> 00:08:49,141
Thank you.

179
00:08:49,207 --> 00:08:50,515
- You lost some weight.
- Is this kid all right?

180
00:08:50,575 --> 00:08:52,384
- You're not a little fat kid no more.
- No, no, no.

181
00:08:52,443 --> 00:08:53,581
- Remember this one?
- No,no.

182
00:08:53,645 --> 00:08:55,215
Yeah, we used to do this to you all the time.

183
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,020
- Remember, back in the day?
- Hey, nugget pocket.

184
00:08:57,081 --> 00:08:58,890
- Nugget pockets.
- No, I'm not a nugget pocket.

185
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,827
- What's up, nugget pocket?
- No.

186
00:09:01,352 --> 00:09:02,660
No, but seriously, Iceberg,

187
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,461
me and my boy got a little head start on you,

188
00:09:04,522 --> 00:09:07,162
but you got any desire
to get wasted with us?

189
00:09:07,225 --> 00:09:09,000
More than life itself.

190
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,506
In fact, I might have
a little head start on you guys.

191
00:09:12,497 --> 00:09:13,999
What?

192
00:09:15,066 --> 00:09:16,602
- Yeah.
- It's so illegal.

193
00:09:16,934 --> 00:09:18,743
I don't want to do that in front of my kid.

194
00:09:18,803 --> 00:09:20,680
Turn around for a minute. Just turn around.

195
00:09:20,938 --> 00:09:22,417
Give me that fucking shit.

196
00:09:23,808 --> 00:09:25,151
What?

197
00:09:26,344 --> 00:09:28,085
Hey, let's get out of here.

198
00:09:28,146 --> 00:09:29,318
I did not do that.

199
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,291
- Let's go have some fun.
- Hey!

200
00:09:31,649 --> 00:09:33,686
Hey, where you think you're going,
Mr. Vanilla Ice Cream?

201
00:09:34,052 --> 00:09:35,292
I'm going out for the night, man.

202
00:09:35,353 --> 00:09:38,300
Hell no, man! You know I don't know
how to fry no damn chicken nuggets!

203
00:09:38,356 --> 00:09:39,426
It's Todd Bridges.

204
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,026
Yeah, yeah, watch this.

205
00:09:41,092 --> 00:09:42,594
What you talking 'bout, Willis?

206
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,171
You come back and say that to my face,

207
00:09:44,228 --> 00:09:45,901
you fake white rapping motherfucker!

208
00:09:46,097 --> 00:09:47,405
Todd, seriously, though, you look great.

209
00:09:47,465 --> 00:09:49,138
How's Mr. Drummond doing, huh?

210
00:09:50,101 --> 00:09:51,671
Mister... Fuck you!

211
00:09:51,736 --> 00:09:53,113
"Mr. Drummond. Mister..."

212
00:09:53,905 --> 00:09:55,714
Man, I... What you want?

213
00:09:55,773 --> 00:09:56,877
Bowl of chili nuggets.

214
00:09:56,941 --> 00:09:57,942
A what?

215
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:00,080
You know, that shit ain't on the menu, man!

216
00:10:01,646 --> 00:10:03,319
Shit, it is. Damn it.

217
00:10:04,048 --> 00:10:06,460
Fucking skate! Just fucking skate!

218
00:10:07,085 --> 00:10:08,530
The Berger boys are here!

219
00:10:08,586 --> 00:10:10,259
Come on, look out! Look out, now!

220
00:10:10,321 --> 00:10:11,493
What the fuck?

221
00:10:15,126 --> 00:10:17,732
Hey! Give me my hat back!

222
00:10:19,764 --> 00:10:21,539
- Do it, do it!
- Give it back!

223
00:10:23,935 --> 00:10:26,415
Hey, it's a fucking lovely night, ain't it?

224
00:10:26,504 --> 00:10:27,642
Oh. my God!

225
00:10:29,874 --> 00:10:31,717
You fucking assholes!

226
00:10:38,116 --> 00:10:39,288
Go, go!

227
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,124
What the... Go!

228
00:10:44,756 --> 00:10:45,928
Go, go, go!

229
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,628
What the fuck? Get out of here!

230
00:10:48,359 --> 00:10:49,463
Holy shit!

231
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:55,272
You know, they seem like fun guys.

232
00:10:56,868 --> 00:10:58,370
We're all gonna dive! Let's go!

233
00:10:59,537 --> 00:11:00,641
What are you doing?

234
00:11:09,147 --> 00:11:10,455
Oh. my God!

235
00:11:10,515 --> 00:11:12,654
I didn't... I didn't spill my beer!

236
00:11:12,717 --> 00:11:14,060
I fucking love it.

237
00:11:15,486 --> 00:11:17,193
- Fuck!
- You fucking hard-ons!

238
00:11:32,236 --> 00:11:33,874
"You fucking hard-ons."

239
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,451
Fucking...

240
00:11:43,181 --> 00:11:45,718
- What are you doing?
- No, no, no, no!

241
00:11:48,486 --> 00:11:51,490
- You don't fucking do that, you fucking idiot!
- Yeah!

242
00:11:52,557 --> 00:11:54,400
Look at this, fuck face. Look at this.

243
00:11:55,193 --> 00:11:56,763
What the fuck?

244
00:11:57,328 --> 00:11:58,363
Come on.

245
00:11:58,429 --> 00:12:00,340
- You fucking guy. I say, take it.
- I can't.

246
00:12:00,431 --> 00:12:01,466
- Just go, go, go, go, go.
- No, wait, wait.

247
00:12:01,532 --> 00:12:02,806
Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop.

248
00:12:02,867 --> 00:12:05,177
I changed my mind. I'm scared.
I don't want to do it.

249
00:12:05,236 --> 00:12:06,613
- Oh, man.
- I can't do it.

250
00:12:07,004 --> 00:12:08,483
You're rubbing your underwear.

251
00:12:08,806 --> 00:12:10,615
What is that? Why are you doing that?

252
00:12:10,808 --> 00:12:12,583
I suppose I'm the reason.

253
00:12:12,877 --> 00:12:15,255
Yeah. Yeah. Remember in first grade

254
00:12:15,313 --> 00:12:16,849
when you were supposed
to pick me up after school,

255
00:12:16,914 --> 00:12:18,393
you left me waiting for five hours?

256
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:20,929
I had detention myself, guy.

257
00:12:20,985 --> 00:12:22,521
What the fuck was I supposed to do?

258
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:25,300
- Yeah, well, I shit in my pants.
- All right.

259
00:12:25,356 --> 00:12:27,996
- Then I had to walk all the way home alone.
- All right.

260
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:29,163
With shit in my pants.

261
00:12:29,293 --> 00:12:32,240
Dude, I promise you,
I'll never forget you again.

262
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:33,707
I swear to God.

263
00:12:33,764 --> 00:12:34,834
Throw the fucking things away.

264
00:12:34,932 --> 00:12:36,934
- Don't fuck with me
- Throw them away.

265
00:12:37,935 --> 00:12:41,246
Throw them away. Throw them away.

266
00:12:41,305 --> 00:12:43,182
Get rid of the fucking underwear,
you don't need that.

267
00:12:43,274 --> 00:12:44,548
You're better than that, guy.

268
00:12:45,009 --> 00:12:46,511
Okay, fuck it. Okay, fuck it.

269
00:12:46,911 --> 00:12:48,652
Squeeze it out and fucking... Yeah.

270
00:12:52,183 --> 00:12:53,321
You're a good kid.

271
00:12:53,384 --> 00:12:56,160
Come on, fucking hit this thing
and let's get it rocking.

272
00:12:56,654 --> 00:12:57,962
- All right. All right?
- Here we go.

273
00:12:58,022 --> 00:12:59,626
- Come on. Push, push. I got you.
- Okay.

274
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,328
- I'm not good at it.
- All right.

275
00:13:01,392 --> 00:13:02,666
It's balance, it's just balance.

276
00:13:02,727 --> 00:13:04,297
You got this, kid. You're an athlete.

277
00:13:04,362 --> 00:13:06,308
You got it. No, it's in you, buddy.

278
00:13:06,364 --> 00:13:07,399
- Straight.
- I don't know how.

279
00:13:07,465 --> 00:13:08,637
I got you. I ain't gonna let you fall.

280
00:13:08,699 --> 00:13:10,372
- Don't let me go.
- I won't let you fall.

281
00:13:10,434 --> 00:13:11,674
- Don't let go.
- All right, I'm still with you.

282
00:13:11,736 --> 00:13:12,737
- Okay.
- I'm still with you.

283
00:13:12,803 --> 00:13:14,942
Let's pick up some speed, though.
I'm with you, guy.

284
00:13:15,006 --> 00:13:16,314
I'm with you. I'm with you.

285
00:13:16,374 --> 00:13:17,512
- I'm not letting go.
- Don't let me go.

286
00:13:17,575 --> 00:13:19,748
I'm not letting go. I'm with you, my boy.

287
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,346
- Wait...
- I'm with you, my boy!

288
00:13:21,412 --> 00:13:23,858
- Yeah, that's all you!
- I'm doing it!

289
00:13:24,215 --> 00:13:26,217
- Yeah! Yeah, yeah, baby!
- I'm doing it!

290
00:13:27,551 --> 00:13:29,087
Oh. my God!

291
00:13:31,689 --> 00:13:32,827
Are you...

292
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:33,925
Kid, are you...

293
00:13:33,991 --> 00:13:35,334
Are you all right, buddy?

294
00:13:35,526 --> 00:13:36,698
Sorry.

295
00:13:36,761 --> 00:13:38,672
- Dude, I'm trying to make love to my wife!
- What the fuck?

296
00:13:38,729 --> 00:13:40,504
- No!
- Fucking naked people.

297
00:13:40,564 --> 00:13:42,168
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

298
00:13:42,233 --> 00:13:43,576
Oh, my God, they're chasing me!

299
00:13:43,634 --> 00:13:44,908
What the fuck? Get off him!

300
00:13:45,169 --> 00:13:46,170
Go!

301
00:13:46,237 --> 00:13:47,477
- Oh, my God! Look out!
- Go!

302
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,651
Keep going, guy!

303
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:52,187
Donny!

304
00:13:54,145 --> 00:13:55,351
- Yeah!
- You're the best.

305
00:13:55,413 --> 00:13:56,653
- You are, Jay.
- Good luck!

306
00:13:56,714 --> 00:13:58,159
I like your fucking hairdo!

307
00:13:58,215 --> 00:14:00,695
Good luck with the taxi business!

308
00:14:00,751 --> 00:14:02,753
- Love that guy.
- Classic. Classic.

309
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,294
Classic.

310
00:14:04,388 --> 00:14:05,799
It's a classic night.

311
00:14:05,856 --> 00:14:08,496
No way! Party's not over!

312
00:14:08,893 --> 00:14:10,270
Come on!

313
00:14:13,064 --> 00:14:14,543
Dude, Uncle Vanny's fucked up.

314
00:14:16,801 --> 00:14:18,144
I love you, son.

315
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,810
I do.

316
00:14:23,874 --> 00:14:25,182
I've always loved you, all right?

317
00:14:26,978 --> 00:14:28,651
Sorry to spring that on you like that.

318
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,081
It's all right.

319
00:14:30,147 --> 00:14:32,218
It's cool, Donny. That's nice, thank you.

320
00:14:32,283 --> 00:14:33,694
Hansie, Hansie.

321
00:14:34,785 --> 00:14:38,460
Why don't you not call me
"Donny" when no one's around.

322
00:14:38,522 --> 00:14:40,058
You can call me "Dad."

323
00:14:41,325 --> 00:14:42,702
Yeah, I know, I know.

324
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,966
It's...

325
00:14:45,329 --> 00:14:47,468
I don't know if I'm ready for that, Donny.

326
00:14:47,531 --> 00:14:48,874
- You know?
- Yeah, yeah.

327
00:14:50,634 --> 00:14:51,704
No prob.

328
00:15:05,282 --> 00:15:06,454
Sorry.

329
00:15:06,851 --> 00:15:09,525
Sorry if you fucking don't like me.

330
00:15:14,058 --> 00:15:17,005
I probably would've fucked my teacher, too.

331
00:15:20,131 --> 00:15:21,508
Yeah.

332
00:15:21,966 --> 00:15:23,309
But...

333
00:15:34,145 --> 00:15:37,092
So, what time are we gonna
go to the prison tomorrow?

334
00:15:38,616 --> 00:15:40,687
Wait, you'll go to the prison?

335
00:15:41,218 --> 00:15:42,925
Yeah, I'll go.

336
00:15:44,455 --> 00:15:46,230
No.No,no,no,no,no

337
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:48,793
That's... They canceled that.

338
00:15:48,859 --> 00:15:54,901
I talked to the warden, and he says
that your mother was just pulling our leg.

339
00:15:54,965 --> 00:15:56,774
She's only got the chicken pox.

340
00:15:57,401 --> 00:15:59,540
- What?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.

341
00:15:59,603 --> 00:16:01,514
She said she was dying because

342
00:16:01,572 --> 00:16:04,382
they give you better food
if you're wicked sick like that,

343
00:16:04,442 --> 00:16:08,754
like Beefaroni or microwave pizza
or some shit, so...

344
00:16:10,281 --> 00:16:11,851
That just made me hungry.

345
00:16:12,483 --> 00:16:14,053
Well, check your pockets.

346
00:16:20,591 --> 00:16:22,002
A treasure!

347
00:16:22,493 --> 00:16:23,528
Come on, eat it.

348
00:16:23,594 --> 00:16:25,164
- No, it's nasty.
- Come on, I'm telling you.

349
00:16:25,229 --> 00:16:27,231
Fucking Todd Bridges
worked hard on that thing.

350
00:16:27,298 --> 00:16:29,039
Yeah. You like that.

351
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,170
Pretty good.

352
00:16:31,535 --> 00:16:34,038
Look at me, I'm a fountain!

353
00:16:34,105 --> 00:16:35,516
Throw a penny in here!

354
00:16:35,573 --> 00:16:37,575
Make a wish, motherfucker!

355
00:16:54,758 --> 00:16:56,135
What the...

356
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,797
Grandma D, what's going on?
What are you doing here?

357
00:16:59,063 --> 00:17:01,134
Well, you've had the fantasy,

358
00:17:01,999 --> 00:17:05,173
so now it's time that you try the real thing.

359
00:17:09,406 --> 00:17:11,682
No, no, no, I can't do that.

360
00:17:11,742 --> 00:17:13,085
I'm sorry.

361
00:17:13,144 --> 00:17:14,748
I appreciate the offer.

362
00:17:15,913 --> 00:17:17,392
No, no, no, don't.

363
00:17:17,448 --> 00:17:19,928
I can't. Don't you... I shouldn't.

364
00:17:21,852 --> 00:17:24,128
Oh, God.

365
00:17:24,922 --> 00:17:27,266
You got the old-timey bathing suit on.

366
00:17:30,127 --> 00:17:31,435
Okay, I'm in.

367
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:36,273
I'm going to ride you like a Model T.

368
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,919
Yeah.

369
00:17:54,251 --> 00:17:55,787
Jamie.

370
00:17:56,754 --> 00:17:58,700
You're wearing your dress again.

371
00:17:59,924 --> 00:18:01,835
You look beautiful.

372
00:18:02,826 --> 00:18:04,499
I want you so bad.

373
00:18:05,262 --> 00:18:06,764
Be nice to me.

374
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,040
Make me feel good.

375
00:18:13,904 --> 00:18:15,713
All right, all right.

376
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:19,317
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

377
00:18:31,956 --> 00:18:33,902
Oh. my God!

378
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,463
Help me!

379
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,695
What happened?

380
00:18:37,761 --> 00:18:38,796
Are you okay?

381
00:18:39,196 --> 00:18:40,834
Do I sound okay?

382
00:18:41,131 --> 00:18:43,634
You puked all over my wedding dress!

383
00:18:44,368 --> 00:18:46,109
Prepare to get fucked up, motherfuckers!

384
00:18:47,871 --> 00:18:50,112
Sorry, I heard you scream.

385
00:18:50,174 --> 00:18:52,017
I thought Jamie was getting murdered,

386
00:18:52,076 --> 00:18:53,987
so I was gonna fucking
smack someone around.

387
00:18:54,445 --> 00:18:56,015
- What happened?
- I don't know!

388
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,883
I just found my wedding dress
covered in barf!

389
00:18:58,949 --> 00:19:02,226
And something else, something sticky.

390
00:19:20,704 --> 00:19:21,774
It's jizz.

391
00:19:23,674 --> 00:19:26,518
You puked on my dress and then fucked it!

392
00:19:28,479 --> 00:19:30,425
You're a madman.

393
00:19:30,481 --> 00:19:32,222
No, no, no, no. No.

394
00:19:32,516 --> 00:19:34,154
- Sweetheart, it wasn't my boy.
- You shut up.

395
00:19:34,218 --> 00:19:35,288
Donny, just shut up!

396
00:19:35,352 --> 00:19:36,695
Who wants a piece of this, huh?

397
00:19:36,754 --> 00:19:38,495
- Who wants a piece?
- Whoa, no, no, no!

398
00:19:38,656 --> 00:19:39,726
It's okay, buddy.

399
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,497
Todd just fucked the dress.

400
00:19:41,892 --> 00:19:43,030
It's under control.

401
00:19:44,161 --> 00:19:45,902
What is Vanilla Ice doing in our room?

402
00:19:46,964 --> 00:19:50,343
He's my other best friend.

403
00:19:50,634 --> 00:19:52,170
Yeah. And a wicked good rapper.

404
00:19:52,236 --> 00:19:53,943
Give it up for him. Come on, now.

405
00:19:54,338 --> 00:19:56,375
- Let's give it up.
- My boy.

406
00:19:56,607 --> 00:19:57,642
I don't know what's going on here,

407
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,187
but I don't have time to deal with this, so...

408
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,817
Okay, this is what's gonna happen.

409
00:20:01,879 --> 00:20:03,881
I'm gonna go take a shower.
I'm gonna go to Pilates.

410
00:20:03,947 --> 00:20:05,893
You're gonna take that dress
to the dry cleaners!

411
00:20:05,949 --> 00:20:07,690
And then we're gonna have
rehearsal dinner tonight,

412
00:20:07,751 --> 00:20:09,697
and you're gonna be
the normal Todd from three days ago, right?

413
00:20:09,953 --> 00:20:13,366
And you can start by taking out
that stupid Duran Duran earring!

414
00:20:13,691 --> 00:20:15,034
I was thinking it's more Foreigner.

415
00:20:15,092 --> 00:20:17,436
No? No, no,
Duran Duran's a good call, though.

416
00:20:21,699 --> 00:20:23,906
Guess I'm gonna go
finish up with Grandma Delores.

417
00:20:23,967 --> 00:20:25,037
- Yeah.
- Is that all right?

418
00:20:25,102 --> 00:20:26,172
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Have fun, buddy. Have fun.

419
00:20:26,236 --> 00:20:27,374
Not too much, though. Don't hurt her.

420
00:20:27,438 --> 00:20:28,849
No, no. I get it right and keep it tight.

421
00:20:28,906 --> 00:20:30,317
Okay.

422
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:33,377
Look, I need a couple hours to fix this.

423
00:20:33,444 --> 00:20:36,948
Hey, we've all been in that situation,
and you'll be fine, kid.

424
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,693
I'll whip up some pancakes
for everyone else, all right?

425
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,093
- All right.
- I love it.

426
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,122
You jizzed on a mannequin.

427
00:20:45,189 --> 00:20:46,429
Respect it.

428
00:20:48,192 --> 00:20:50,399
But you were only 13.

429
00:20:50,894 --> 00:20:52,498
She took advantage of you.

430
00:20:52,563 --> 00:20:55,134
No, all right.
That's what the law says, Su-Jin,

431
00:20:55,366 --> 00:20:57,972
but I don't know...
We were kind of like soul mates.

432
00:20:58,035 --> 00:20:59,708
You know, there was...
There was a connection there.

433
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,272
I never had it with anyone else.

434
00:21:01,805 --> 00:21:03,546
I'm getting a call. I'm sorry, guys.

435
00:21:03,607 --> 00:21:05,609
Do not touch these plates. I'm cleaning them.

436
00:21:05,676 --> 00:21:06,677
Okay, Su-Jin?

437
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,815
Go for Donny B.

438
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:10,590
Wassup!

439
00:21:11,014 --> 00:21:13,722
Hey, big man. What's going on?

440
00:21:13,784 --> 00:21:14,785
How'd it go with the lady?

441
00:21:14,852 --> 00:21:16,354
You patch things up?

442
00:21:16,754 --> 00:21:18,256
Yeah, pretty much. It was amazing.

443
00:21:18,322 --> 00:21:22,168
The dry cleaner said they've
definitely seen that combo of fluid before.

444
00:21:22,226 --> 00:21:25,298
You see? Yeah, those things
go together like gin and tonic.

445
00:21:25,963 --> 00:21:27,704
<i>Hey, listen, while I got you,</i>

446
00:21:27,765 --> 00:21:30,075
I left you a little
best man gift on your dresser.

447
00:21:30,134 --> 00:21:31,374
I think you'll get a kick out of it.

448
00:21:31,668 --> 00:21:34,012
You did not. Oh, my God.

449
00:21:34,071 --> 00:21:37,143
My whole body, like,
got a shocked feeling over that.

450
00:21:37,207 --> 00:21:38,686
Buddy, no one gets me a gift.

451
00:21:38,876 --> 00:21:40,878
<i>- Where are you, anyways?
- I'm in the car.</i>

452
00:21:40,944 --> 00:21:42,855
I decided to go see Mom after all.

453
00:21:43,914 --> 00:21:44,984
You did what?

454
00:21:46,517 --> 00:21:47,894
<i>Oh, my God. Dukes ofHazzard!</i>

455
00:22:06,603 --> 00:22:07,877
Hansie.

456
00:22:07,938 --> 00:22:09,645
Donny, what are you doing here?

457
00:22:09,706 --> 00:22:11,276
We got to get out of here now.

458
00:22:11,575 --> 00:22:12,883
What? What are you talking about?

459
00:22:12,943 --> 00:22:14,388
It's your wedding weekend, dude.

460
00:22:14,445 --> 00:22:15,446
You come here after the wedding.

461
00:22:15,512 --> 00:22:16,752
You show your mother your new ring.

462
00:22:16,814 --> 00:22:18,191
That would make her happy.

463
00:22:18,482 --> 00:22:20,291
Wait, are you nervous to see her?

464
00:22:20,517 --> 00:22:24,192
Hansie, can we just blow this place off
and have a beer, please? I'm begging you.

465
00:22:24,254 --> 00:22:25,358
Look. Is that her?

466
00:22:54,651 --> 00:22:56,324
Oh, my God.

467
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,422
There you are.

468
00:22:59,289 --> 00:23:02,099
My little Hansie, you're all grown up.

469
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:03,863
Hi, Mom.

470
00:23:04,228 --> 00:23:05,969
I didn't know if I'd ever see you again.

471
00:23:06,396 --> 00:23:08,034
I know. I'm sorry I stopped visiting.

472
00:23:08,098 --> 00:23:09,099
It just got too hard.

473
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:11,373
No, I totally understand.

474
00:23:12,503 --> 00:23:13,846
Wow.

475
00:23:14,037 --> 00:23:15,243
You still have my eyes.

476
00:23:16,573 --> 00:23:20,680
Is that the earring
that I gave you after the Loverboy concert?

477
00:23:23,914 --> 00:23:25,951
Yes, it is, Miss McGarricle.

478
00:23:26,183 --> 00:23:28,993
You know, I think about you every day.

479
00:23:29,052 --> 00:23:32,033
Fuck, I love you so much, Miss McGarricle.
I never stopped.

480
00:23:32,756 --> 00:23:34,394
I love you, too.

481
00:23:35,993 --> 00:23:37,131
Do you remember...

482
00:23:37,694 --> 00:23:38,729
Oh, God, here we go.

483
00:23:39,229 --> 00:23:43,268
...all the nasty things
that I taught you, Donny?

484
00:23:44,935 --> 00:23:47,381
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Of course I do, Miss McGarricle.

485
00:23:47,704 --> 00:23:50,344
Are you still my dirty boy?

486
00:23:51,275 --> 00:23:55,223
Yeah, I'm the dirtiest boy
you'll ever know, Miss McGarricle.

487
00:23:56,013 --> 00:23:57,185
Donny.

488
00:23:59,049 --> 00:24:00,357
Oh, fuck, yeah.

489
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:09,393
I'm hard right now. I'm hard.

490
00:24:09,927 --> 00:24:12,168
Okay. Yeah, I'm hating that, so...

491
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:15,704
But it is really good to see you, Mom. I...

492
00:24:15,766 --> 00:24:16,938
It's good to see you, too, baby.

493
00:24:17,768 --> 00:24:20,544
Can you describe
what you're feeling right now, Han?

494
00:24:20,938 --> 00:24:22,542
TV's Randall Morgan?

495
00:24:23,273 --> 00:24:24,752
What are you doing here?

496
00:24:24,808 --> 00:24:27,846
Must be quite emotional
for you to be face-to-face

497
00:24:27,911 --> 00:24:30,357
with the woman
who molested your father, isn't it?

498
00:24:30,647 --> 00:24:32,957
- What is going on right now?
- Who is this dude?

499
00:24:33,016 --> 00:24:34,927
Listen, before you get mad at me...

500
00:24:34,985 --> 00:24:36,658
This is why you came to see me?

501
00:24:36,987 --> 00:24:38,864
For some reality TV ambush?

502
00:24:38,956 --> 00:24:40,731
- No.
- How much they paying you, Donny?

503
00:24:40,824 --> 00:24:42,428
Nothing, I swear to God. I'm not getting...

504
00:24:42,492 --> 00:24:45,939
Fifty thousand dollars
to deliver you to this prison.

505
00:24:46,263 --> 00:24:48,800
All right, it was 50 grand, but I'm not...
I'm not...

506
00:24:48,865 --> 00:24:50,435
I'm not going to do it. I swear to God.

507
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,979
I'm not... I would never take his money.

508
00:24:52,035 --> 00:24:53,241
Donny Berger, what have you done?

509
00:24:53,537 --> 00:24:54,948
Hansie, dude, it's me.

510
00:24:55,305 --> 00:24:56,579
It's the guy from last night.

511
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,983
We had fun. Don't fuck it.

512
00:24:58,041 --> 00:24:59,145
I'm telling you, this is...

513
00:24:59,209 --> 00:25:00,279
This is something that can be fixed.

514
00:25:00,644 --> 00:25:01,918
- You're unreal.
- Hansie.

515
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,981
What...

516
00:25:04,047 --> 00:25:06,550
You go after him, Donny,
and you take care of our son.

517
00:25:06,883 --> 00:25:09,727
- Hansie.
- Come on, he is pissed. Fuck!

518
00:25:10,053 --> 00:25:12,192
- Take care of our baby, Donny!
- Hansie!

519
00:25:12,556 --> 00:25:14,433
Hansie, please, let me explain to you...

520
00:25:14,491 --> 00:25:16,368
I can't believe I let you
back into my life again.

521
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,736
Guy, guy, just come on. Listen to me.

522
00:25:19,096 --> 00:25:20,939
I owe the IRS a lot of money.

523
00:25:20,998 --> 00:25:23,239
- Of course you do.
- I know, I know. I'm a fuck-up.

524
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:26,509
But if I don't give them 43 G's by Tuesday,
I'm going to prison.

525
00:25:26,837 --> 00:25:28,578
Wait, so you're telling me,

526
00:25:28,639 --> 00:25:30,949
if I give you 43 grand,
you don't have to go to jail?

527
00:25:32,209 --> 00:25:34,189
I will pay you back, I swear to God.

528
00:25:34,244 --> 00:25:35,655
Would you loan me the money?

529
00:25:35,846 --> 00:25:37,450
No! Fuck you!

530
00:25:37,514 --> 00:25:39,551
- Get your shit out of my boss's house!
- Okay!

531
00:25:40,584 --> 00:25:41,892
No! Don't do that.

532
00:25:41,952 --> 00:25:43,932
That's my boy there.

533
00:25:45,956 --> 00:25:47,162
No.

534
00:25:47,224 --> 00:25:48,965
I think he just shit his pants.

535
00:25:49,026 --> 00:25:50,699
Tell me you got that on camera.

536
00:25:50,961 --> 00:25:52,941
You made me throw out my extra underwear!

537
00:25:52,996 --> 00:25:56,205
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you were going to shit yourself again.

538
00:25:56,433 --> 00:25:57,639
That was awesome.

539
00:25:57,968 --> 00:25:59,242
That was awesome.

540
00:25:59,569 --> 00:26:01,845
Donny, couldn't have gone any better.
Loved it.

541
00:26:01,905 --> 00:26:03,646
You know what I need from you, Todd,
is I need you

542
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,016
-to sign the release form right...
- Fuck you!

543
00:26:06,877 --> 00:26:07,947
Get away from me!

544
00:26:08,011 --> 00:26:09,513
Get those cameras off me!

545
00:26:11,314 --> 00:26:14,022
I hate you, Dad.

546
00:26:17,954 --> 00:26:19,331
Hansie!

547
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:23,230
I can't pay you a dime
unless I got a release form.

548
00:26:23,994 --> 00:26:25,439
Fuck.

549
00:26:25,495 --> 00:26:27,065
Did I get any shit on me?

550
00:26:55,926 --> 00:26:58,600
Let me off here. Let me off.
Let me get off. I'll fucking run up.

551
00:26:58,929 --> 00:27:00,135
Keep it running.

552
00:27:00,197 --> 00:27:01,574
I got to pick my shit up.

553
00:27:22,252 --> 00:27:23,754
You're so adorable.

554
00:27:24,721 --> 00:27:26,997
No, I know, but I told you
not to call me on this line.

555
00:27:27,057 --> 00:27:28,559
What if Todd picks up?

556
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,200
No, no, no, I want to.

557
00:27:35,065 --> 00:27:36,271
No, Steve.

558
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:37,937
Todd doesn't know anything.

559
00:27:38,101 --> 00:27:40,638
I don't care if he finds out after the wedding.

560
00:27:40,737 --> 00:27:42,114
There's nothing he can do
about it then anyway.

561
00:27:43,273 --> 00:27:44,718
You're so sweet.

562
00:27:44,775 --> 00:27:46,413
Steve, huh?

563
00:27:47,544 --> 00:27:51,014
Well, Steve Spirou, I'm going to fuck you up.

564
00:27:51,748 --> 00:27:54,820
I'm going to fuck you up!

565
00:27:57,521 --> 00:27:59,558
Well, I got some great news.

566
00:27:59,823 --> 00:28:02,167
I've made my decision
on who my new partner is.

567
00:28:04,461 --> 00:28:05,804
Phil!

568
00:28:05,862 --> 00:28:07,808
Phil, I knew you could do it.

569
00:28:07,864 --> 00:28:09,343
Look at Phil's face.

570
00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:11,845
I'm just busting your balls, Phil.

571
00:28:11,902 --> 00:28:13,575
No, I'd never pick you.

572
00:28:13,637 --> 00:28:14,877
Oh, no.

573
00:28:14,971 --> 00:28:17,474
It's you, Todd. Partners.

574
00:28:18,775 --> 00:28:19,913
Partner.

575
00:28:19,976 --> 00:28:20,977
Oh, my gosh.

576
00:28:21,044 --> 00:28:23,354
It's going to be a lot more hours
and a lot more responsibility.

577
00:28:23,413 --> 00:28:24,619
You know that, right?

578
00:28:24,681 --> 00:28:27,025
And a lot more money!

579
00:28:30,821 --> 00:28:32,562
- Somebody's going shopping!
- Yeah!

580
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:35,866
I thought he left.

581
00:28:35,926 --> 00:28:37,633
Yeah, that's what you wish, Steve.

582
00:28:37,694 --> 00:28:39,731
I need to talk to you, homeboy. Yeah.

583
00:28:39,796 --> 00:28:40,831
Hey, Jamie.

584
00:28:41,498 --> 00:28:42,568
Listen. Listen.

585
00:28:42,632 --> 00:28:45,476
Dude, this is not about you and me, all right?

586
00:28:46,036 --> 00:28:47,538
You're not marrying the right girl.

587
00:28:47,604 --> 00:28:48,708
She is cheating on you.

588
00:28:49,272 --> 00:28:50,649
You are unbelievable.

589
00:28:50,707 --> 00:28:51,777
Can't you just let it go?

590
00:28:51,842 --> 00:28:53,150
This is my last chance to be normal.

591
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:54,484
Are you determined to ruin my life?

592
00:28:55,178 --> 00:28:56,953
- Honey, what's going on?
- Nothing.

593
00:28:57,013 --> 00:28:59,391
Don't "honey" him,
you little snake in the grass.

594
00:28:59,749 --> 00:29:01,251
I heard your phone call.

595
00:29:01,318 --> 00:29:04,265
"Steve, why'd you call on this line?

596
00:29:04,321 --> 00:29:05,732
"Todd could have picked up."

597
00:29:05,956 --> 00:29:07,026
That's right, sonny boy.

598
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:08,967
Your wife-to-be's fucking your boss.

599
00:29:09,259 --> 00:29:10,329
Right there.

600
00:29:10,694 --> 00:29:11,798
Fuck you, buddy.

601
00:29:12,062 --> 00:29:13,939
You are an idiot!

602
00:29:13,997 --> 00:29:15,135
Is that right, sweetheart?

603
00:29:15,198 --> 00:29:16,643
- Yes, it is.
- Yeah, yeah. Why?

604
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,078
I was on the phone with Steve.

605
00:29:19,336 --> 00:29:23,409
Steve Goldstein,
the Boston Herald wedding reporter.

606
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:26,687
Yeah, he's doing a piece on
the most beautiful places to get married,

607
00:29:26,743 --> 00:29:29,246
and I didn't want Todd to know
because he doesn't like being in the paper.

608
00:29:29,346 --> 00:29:32,452
So, I am sorry
that I wanted everyone in the world

609
00:29:32,515 --> 00:29:34,517
to know I married the perfect guy.

610
00:29:34,584 --> 00:29:38,760
Honey, do you think you can forgive me
for keeping such a big secret from you?

611
00:29:41,324 --> 00:29:44,771
Okay, due to this newfound evidence,

612
00:29:45,762 --> 00:29:48,709
the conclusion might be that I'm an asshole.

613
00:29:49,766 --> 00:29:50,836
Bye.

614
00:29:52,936 --> 00:29:54,506
Fine.

615
00:29:54,571 --> 00:29:55,709
Have a good wedding.

616
00:29:57,874 --> 00:29:59,410
I'll leave with pride.

617
00:29:59,976 --> 00:30:01,319
I'm a good person.

618
00:30:03,513 --> 00:30:05,686
Bye! I'll see you tomorrow!

619
00:30:10,553 --> 00:30:12,089
Wow, what a stressful day, huh?

620
00:30:12,522 --> 00:30:14,126
- Can't wait to get back to the beach house.
- Thank you.

621
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:16,170
- Bye.
- Just the two of us, you know?

622
00:30:16,493 --> 00:30:18,837
No, honey.
I'm staying in the city tonight, remember?

623
00:30:19,062 --> 00:30:20,735
- What? No.
- Yeah, the bride and groom,

624
00:30:20,797 --> 00:30:23,073
they're supposed to sleep separate
night before the wedding.

625
00:30:23,133 --> 00:30:24,373
So see you tomorrow, big guy.

626
00:30:24,434 --> 00:30:26,311
I'm going to drop Jamie
at the Fairmont Copley.

627
00:30:26,436 --> 00:30:28,473
Mom and Dad,
you guys got the hedgehog. Okay!

628
00:30:28,772 --> 00:30:29,842
- Love you.
- Watch the door.

629
00:30:29,906 --> 00:30:31,681
- Love you. Okay.
- Sleep well.

630
00:30:32,042 --> 00:30:33,817
Wait, but don't they not have a car?

631
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,755
All right, Donny, go.
There's your chance. Go.

632
00:30:41,818 --> 00:30:43,729
I ain't got no more chances, buddy.

633
00:30:43,787 --> 00:30:45,494
The kid hates my guts.

634
00:30:45,755 --> 00:30:47,359
Right? 'Cause you guys don't have a car.

635
00:30:47,424 --> 00:30:48,960
I'm not talking about him, Donny.

636
00:30:49,626 --> 00:30:51,264
- Wake up, man.
- What?

637
00:30:51,661 --> 00:30:53,766
Jamie's the gatekeeper for your son.

638
00:30:54,064 --> 00:30:57,477
- Yeah?
- Win her over, then she'll convince Han

639
00:30:57,801 --> 00:30:59,838
to give you another chance. Boom!

640
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:04,243
How am I ever going to get her trust?
She freaking hates me.

641
00:31:04,741 --> 00:31:07,187
Donny, you want to know
what all women love?

642
00:31:08,144 --> 00:31:09,589
Ice cream.

643
00:31:18,655 --> 00:31:20,566
Hi. I'm Todd Peterson.

644
00:31:21,091 --> 00:31:22,968
No, you're not. You're Donny Berger.

645
00:31:23,026 --> 00:31:24,937
You fucked your teacher
in the seventh grade.

646
00:31:28,231 --> 00:31:29,972
Hi. I'm Todd Peterson.

647
00:31:30,033 --> 00:31:31,740
Hi, Mr. Peterson. What can I do for you?

648
00:31:32,135 --> 00:31:34,115
What room was my fiancée in again?

649
00:31:34,237 --> 00:31:36,513
Let me check. 641.

650
00:31:36,873 --> 00:31:38,079
You're a fucking stud.

651
00:31:39,909 --> 00:31:41,855
Hey, when the legendary
Donny Berger comes in here

652
00:31:41,911 --> 00:31:43,982
using a fake name, you go with it!

653
00:31:44,047 --> 00:31:45,583
All right, I will.

654
00:31:50,787 --> 00:31:53,393
641. 641.

655
00:31:53,456 --> 00:31:55,527
All right, come on, sweetheart.

656
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:57,502
Oh, yeah!

657
00:31:59,796 --> 00:32:00,900
What, did Todd come out here?

658
00:32:00,964 --> 00:32:02,773
You're half the size of Todd,

659
00:32:02,832 --> 00:32:05,540
but you use it so much better!

660
00:32:05,602 --> 00:32:07,741
I guess not.

661
00:32:07,804 --> 00:32:08,874
Oh. my God!

662
00:32:08,938 --> 00:32:10,417
Oh, my God.

663
00:32:10,473 --> 00:32:11,850
Oh. my God!

664
00:32:11,908 --> 00:32:13,615
Oh, my God.

665
00:32:14,677 --> 00:32:16,281
Fucking shit!

666
00:32:16,346 --> 00:32:17,654
Fucking shit.

667
00:32:17,714 --> 00:32:18,784
Fucking shit!

668
00:32:18,848 --> 00:32:19,883
Fucking shit.

669
00:32:21,785 --> 00:32:23,162
Yeah. Okay.

670
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,463
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

671
00:32:47,944 --> 00:32:49,389
Okay.

672
00:32:51,981 --> 00:32:53,790
Yeah!

673
00:32:54,317 --> 00:32:56,388
You do not deserve these treats.

674
00:32:58,888 --> 00:32:59,992
Are you finished, sweetheart?

675
00:33:00,824 --> 00:33:01,962
Oh, my God.

676
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,498
Your fiancé's at home, you know.

677
00:33:05,929 --> 00:33:07,567
This really gets me upset.

678
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:09,041
You know why?

679
00:33:09,099 --> 00:33:10,737
'Cause he's too good for you.

680
00:33:11,267 --> 00:33:12,974
He is.

681
00:33:13,036 --> 00:33:15,983
And you're sitting here gallivanting with...

682
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:18,110
I think I know who.

683
00:33:18,208 --> 00:33:21,712
Don't I, Mr. Steve Goldstein?

684
00:33:27,016 --> 00:33:29,326
Wait. Are you...

685
00:33:30,186 --> 00:33:31,529
What am I seeing?

686
00:33:31,821 --> 00:33:33,528
No... It...

687
00:33:34,858 --> 00:33:35,928
With each other?

688
00:33:37,327 --> 00:33:39,102
Am I... This is...

689
00:33:42,232 --> 00:33:45,042
Is he your stepbrother at least

690
00:33:45,101 --> 00:33:47,342
or adopted or something?

691
00:33:48,638 --> 00:33:49,844
No reply.

692
00:33:49,906 --> 00:33:50,907
So it's real.

693
00:33:50,974 --> 00:33:52,214
Oh, my God.

694
00:33:52,275 --> 00:33:53,720
Donny, Donny, you don't...

695
00:33:53,776 --> 00:33:55,187
You don't understand what's going on here.

696
00:33:55,245 --> 00:33:58,624
I don't think Charlie Sheen
would understand what's going on here.

697
00:33:58,948 --> 00:34:02,725
Look, I love Todd,
and we're going to get married,

698
00:34:02,785 --> 00:34:04,594
and we're going to have a great life together.

699
00:34:04,687 --> 00:34:08,328
And yes, I've had sex with Chad
from time to time.

700
00:34:09,759 --> 00:34:11,033
It's what good-looking people do.

701
00:34:11,094 --> 00:34:13,199
They have sex with
other good-looking people.

702
00:34:13,496 --> 00:34:15,100
You know? Just so happens that

703
00:34:15,165 --> 00:34:18,806
this one particular good-looking person
is my little brother.

704
00:34:18,868 --> 00:34:20,472
Okay.

705
00:34:20,537 --> 00:34:22,448
It's all making sense to me now.

706
00:34:25,108 --> 00:34:28,317
I know that sounded bad, but, Donny,
this was going to be the last time.

707
00:34:28,411 --> 00:34:30,652
I would never carry on
with a married woman.

708
00:34:30,914 --> 00:34:33,417
I've got better morals than that, Donny.

709
00:34:34,851 --> 00:34:37,889
Chad, adultery is bad,

710
00:34:39,789 --> 00:34:43,532
but incest is fucked up!

711
00:34:45,528 --> 00:34:48,634
Please don't let him tell Mommy
about our secret tickle time.

712
00:34:48,831 --> 00:34:50,674
"Secret tickle time"?

713
00:34:50,733 --> 00:34:52,804
You got a name for it?

714
00:34:54,437 --> 00:34:58,283
And with a United States
military man, no less.

715
00:34:58,608 --> 00:35:01,145
You are a disgrace to that uniform!

716
00:35:01,211 --> 00:35:02,656
No, he's not a Marine.

717
00:35:02,712 --> 00:35:04,020
He buys those uniforms on eBay

718
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,617
so Dad doesn't find out
he's a modern jazz dancer.

719
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:08,088
What?

720
00:35:08,151 --> 00:35:10,688
That's possibly worse than the incest thing.

721
00:35:11,187 --> 00:35:13,633
This is an abomination. I'm telling Todd.

722
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:16,000
- No, he won't believe you.
- Yeah, he will.

723
00:35:16,259 --> 00:35:19,263
No, he bought that Steve Goldstein story.

724
00:35:19,562 --> 00:35:22,475
Come on, you think he got
that partnership on his own?

725
00:35:22,532 --> 00:35:23,909
With that "beep boop beep" shit?

726
00:35:23,967 --> 00:35:25,002
No, I gave him a boost.

727
00:35:25,768 --> 00:35:27,907
How many people have you fucked?

728
00:35:28,504 --> 00:35:30,609
Well, maybe he'll believe this.

729
00:35:33,977 --> 00:35:35,854
Nice. Save.

730
00:35:37,814 --> 00:35:39,350
You two have fun together.

731
00:35:39,983 --> 00:35:41,155
Sickies.

732
00:35:41,217 --> 00:35:42,696
All right, how much?

733
00:35:43,219 --> 00:35:44,425
I'm going to be a very rich woman.

734
00:35:44,487 --> 00:35:46,023
I can write you a big fat check.

735
00:35:46,389 --> 00:35:48,300
What's it going to take for this to go away?

736
00:35:48,725 --> 00:35:52,172
Todd has to pop a Xanax
when he loses a contact lens.

737
00:35:53,096 --> 00:35:55,542
What do you think he's going to do
when he finds out about this?

738
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:58,008
Todd's happy-

739
00:35:58,067 --> 00:35:59,910
You really want to take that away?

740
00:36:20,223 --> 00:36:21,463
Hey, buddy.

741
00:36:22,725 --> 00:36:25,171
I got something to tell you, and...

742
00:36:26,296 --> 00:36:28,572
I'm not expecting you to believe this, but...

743
00:36:30,733 --> 00:36:32,269
I got the money.

744
00:36:32,368 --> 00:36:33,608
<i>That's great, Donny.</i>

745
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:35,574
Your son came through for you, didn't he?

746
00:36:35,772 --> 00:36:39,686
Yeah. His fiancée gave me $50,000

747
00:36:39,742 --> 00:36:43,155
to keep quiet about her
having sex with her brother.

748
00:36:43,212 --> 00:36:44,850
<i>Yeah, I've been there.</i>

749
00:36:44,981 --> 00:36:46,221
We've all been there.

750
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,230
She said it was her last time, so...

751
00:36:50,386 --> 00:36:51,626
<i>Maybe things will work out.</i>

752
00:36:52,388 --> 00:36:54,527
Then how come I feel like shit right now?

753
00:36:55,358 --> 00:36:56,996
Yeah, it's kind of a moral thicket.

754
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,603
<i>But the good news is</i>

755
00:36:58,661 --> 00:37:01,232
<i>you stay out of the slammer, right, Donny?</i>

756
00:37:02,799 --> 00:37:03,971
<i>Donny?</i>

757
00:37:16,012 --> 00:37:17,548
"Go do something."

758
00:37:19,115 --> 00:37:22,562
I don't know, Mr. Mitty.
I don't know if I can fucking handle it.

759
00:37:24,454 --> 00:37:26,866
"Be a good person."

760
00:37:28,858 --> 00:37:30,025
<i>Donny?</i>

761
00:37:37,433 --> 00:37:38,844
- No, no, don't hit me.
- No, no.

762
00:37:38,901 --> 00:37:41,677
Just give me a moment, please, Todd.
Just a moment. Relax.

763
00:37:42,305 --> 00:37:44,342
You know, after praying with the monsignor,

764
00:37:44,807 --> 00:37:49,085
I realize that I committed the sin
of prideful anger in the church,

765
00:37:49,779 --> 00:37:52,419
and I hope that you'll accept my apology

766
00:37:52,482 --> 00:37:56,191
and allow me the honor
of being a part of this joyous day.

767
00:37:56,786 --> 00:37:58,459
Well, what about Father Shakalu?

768
00:38:00,123 --> 00:38:01,500
Stupid bird.

769
00:38:01,557 --> 00:38:03,002
Come on, fly!

770
00:38:03,626 --> 00:38:05,606
Well, he's cool.

771
00:38:06,562 --> 00:38:08,007
Great. Sounds good.

772
00:38:09,532 --> 00:38:10,840
By the way, Todd

773
00:38:11,801 --> 00:38:13,678
was it you that hit me in the head
with the bottle?

774
00:38:15,138 --> 00:38:16,208
No.

775
00:38:16,639 --> 00:38:18,676
Well, then, who, then?

776
00:38:20,076 --> 00:38:21,146
It was Chad.

777
00:38:21,911 --> 00:38:23,288
Interesting.

778
00:38:24,347 --> 00:38:25,951
Two, three, four.

779
00:38:26,015 --> 00:38:27,153
Fosse, and Fosse,

780
00:38:27,817 --> 00:38:29,353
-and Fosse.
- Interesting.

781
00:38:31,421 --> 00:38:33,367
Yo! Donny Berger! All right!

782
00:38:33,423 --> 00:38:36,632
I'd sign something for you, buddy,
but I got no time right now.

783
00:38:36,692 --> 00:38:38,035
Ice!

784
00:38:38,094 --> 00:38:39,596
Ice, you in there, buddy? I need you!

785
00:38:41,431 --> 00:38:42,569
You still got the 5.0?

786
00:38:44,901 --> 00:38:47,245
What does that mean? Is that a yes or no?
I don't understand the pose.

787
00:38:47,303 --> 00:38:49,146
Yeah? Let's go, let's go!

788
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,893
Go. baby, go!

789
00:39:35,284 --> 00:39:36,456
No!

790
00:40:02,044 --> 00:40:03,216
Look at this fucking guy!

791
00:40:05,214 --> 00:40:06,249
Man!

792
00:40:18,861 --> 00:40:21,467
No, no, no, no, no! We're stuck! We're stuck!

793
00:40:21,531 --> 00:40:23,636
To hell with the 5.0. Let's run for it, man.

794
00:40:23,699 --> 00:40:25,940
- But we need great tunes!
- Come on, let's get them!

795
00:40:26,869 --> 00:40:28,348
Right here, I got a Walkman.

796
00:40:28,404 --> 00:40:29,712
- The Walkman!
- Yeah, baby.

797
00:40:31,841 --> 00:40:32,876
Let's go!

798
00:40:36,445 --> 00:40:37,924
- Damn it, man!
- Come on! Let's go!

799
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,084
Oh. my God!

800
00:40:41,884 --> 00:40:43,386
Hey!

801
00:40:53,496 --> 00:40:55,942
You forgot to pay!

802
00:40:56,165 --> 00:40:59,408
So, Jamie, do you promise
to provide Todd here

803
00:40:59,468 --> 00:41:02,915
with unending empathy,
encouragement and honesty,

804
00:41:03,773 --> 00:41:04,979
till death do you part?

805
00:41:05,508 --> 00:41:06,578
I do.

806
00:41:10,947 --> 00:41:12,722
Hey, Donny. Come on!

807
00:41:19,689 --> 00:41:21,066
What are you doing, guy?

808
00:41:21,457 --> 00:41:22,959
You jumped?

809
00:41:23,025 --> 00:41:24,868
There was a door right here!

810
00:41:24,927 --> 00:41:26,929
Come on, we got to get there!

811
00:41:29,432 --> 00:41:31,036
And you, Todd, do you promise to love,

812
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:34,809
honor and protect this special lady
for the rest of your life?

813
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:39,212
Don't answer that question!

814
00:41:45,114 --> 00:41:46,286
Oh, shit.

815
00:41:49,418 --> 00:41:52,695
We ran well over a mile.

816
00:42:05,501 --> 00:42:07,572
I object to these two getting married.

817
00:42:09,438 --> 00:42:12,749
No, we're past that part already.

818
00:42:13,576 --> 00:42:14,782
What are my options, then?

819
00:42:14,844 --> 00:42:15,879
How about leaving?

820
00:42:16,012 --> 00:42:18,686
You shut the hell up, you satanic hose-bag!

821
00:42:18,948 --> 00:42:19,949
Hey!

822
00:42:20,016 --> 00:42:22,428
Gerald! I'm sorry it sounded so harsh,

823
00:42:22,485 --> 00:42:24,863
but you'll understand
why I said that in a few minutes.

824
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,297
There ain't gonna be a few minutes,

825
00:42:26,355 --> 00:42:28,028
-you goddamn son of a bitch!
- Calm down!

826
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:29,194
Calm down!

827
00:42:30,793 --> 00:42:32,329
Let the boy talk.

828
00:42:32,428 --> 00:42:34,237
I can't let you marry this chick.

829
00:42:34,563 --> 00:42:35,598
I can't believe you're doing this.

830
00:42:35,665 --> 00:42:37,167
Listen to me, buddy.

831
00:42:37,667 --> 00:42:39,408
You don't love this girl.

832
00:42:39,468 --> 00:42:41,709
I'm telling you. I had love, it's different.

833
00:42:41,771 --> 00:42:43,444
It's a different feeling.

834
00:42:43,773 --> 00:42:45,377
Love is like...

835
00:42:46,142 --> 00:42:48,884
It just leads you to a special connection.

836
00:42:48,944 --> 00:42:52,482
It's full of, like, feelings of awesomeness.

837
00:42:52,581 --> 00:42:55,585
And the feelings you...

838
00:42:55,651 --> 00:42:57,221
That wrap around you.

839
00:42:57,753 --> 00:42:59,824
It's deep in your stomach.

840
00:42:59,889 --> 00:43:02,062
It's in your head.
It's in your fucking nut sack.

841
00:43:03,192 --> 00:43:04,728
It's in your dick when it gets hard.

842
00:43:04,794 --> 00:43:06,273
There's still love at the tip.

843
00:43:06,462 --> 00:43:08,305
And it fucking sprinkles out

844
00:43:09,098 --> 00:43:12,204
like morning dew
shooting all over the grass.

845
00:43:12,702 --> 00:43:14,978
Okay, I've had just about enough of this.

846
00:43:15,104 --> 00:43:17,607
Phil, sit down before I tell your wife
what you did at the strip club.

847
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:18,844
Okay.

848
00:43:20,643 --> 00:43:24,989
Son, I'm sorry, I just...
I can't let you marry this skank.

849
00:43:25,247 --> 00:43:26,248
"Son?"

850
00:43:26,682 --> 00:43:28,161
- Your son?
- Son?

851
00:43:28,417 --> 00:43:29,794
What is he talking about?

852
00:43:30,252 --> 00:43:33,131
Honey? You can tell me.

853
00:43:33,956 --> 00:43:35,629
I'll forgive you.

854
00:43:36,225 --> 00:43:38,865
That's what love's about, right? Forgiveness.

855
00:43:40,296 --> 00:43:41,673
All right, fine.

856
00:43:43,432 --> 00:43:45,503
Donny's not my best friend.

857
00:43:46,068 --> 00:43:47,308
He's my father.

858
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:48,805
Oh'

859
00:43:48,871 --> 00:43:51,681
My parents didn't die in an explosion.

860
00:43:51,741 --> 00:43:53,345
I lied because I'm the product of

861
00:43:53,409 --> 00:43:56,117
an inappropriate
teacher-student relationship.

862
00:43:56,178 --> 00:43:58,385
Teacher-student relationship?

863
00:44:00,049 --> 00:44:01,426
Do you know how gross that sounds?

864
00:44:01,484 --> 00:44:02,485
You're disgusting!

865
00:44:03,018 --> 00:44:04,759
Are you fucking kidding me right now?

866
00:44:05,054 --> 00:44:06,897
She can still cancel that check, Donny!

867
00:44:07,056 --> 00:44:08,057
Chad.

868
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:09,564
Cancel what check?

869
00:44:09,625 --> 00:44:10,626
I don't...

870
00:44:10,693 --> 00:44:13,333
She gave me 50 grand
to keep my mouth shut.

871
00:44:14,697 --> 00:44:16,506
Fifty grand? Jamie.

872
00:44:16,565 --> 00:44:19,307
Yeah, it was... I was gonna hold on to it,

873
00:44:19,368 --> 00:44:21,405
you know, to get me out of jail, but...

874
00:44:22,304 --> 00:44:24,113
Yeah, yeah. That's what I think of that.

875
00:44:24,173 --> 00:44:25,914
That's how much I hate this fucking whore.

876
00:44:25,975 --> 00:44:27,818
Wait. Keep your mouth shut about what?

877
00:44:27,877 --> 00:44:29,015
Todd, don't listen to him.

878
00:44:29,245 --> 00:44:31,020
He's a liar and he's crazy!

879
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,082
Father McNally, please continue.
I promise to do

880
00:44:33,149 --> 00:44:34,856
all that shit you mentioned
and so does Todd, right?

881
00:44:34,917 --> 00:44:36,487
Wait, what is going on?

882
00:44:36,552 --> 00:44:37,587
Tell him.

883
00:44:38,988 --> 00:44:40,865
No, no, no, no, no.
Don't tell him, don't tell him.

884
00:44:41,123 --> 00:44:43,399
You tell him or I'll tell everybody here.
It's up to you.

885
00:44:49,765 --> 00:44:50,800
Come on.

886
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,925
Okay. Well, that's not that bad.

887
00:45:06,182 --> 00:45:09,322
What? You didn't tell him,
you fucking lying piece of shit!

888
00:45:09,385 --> 00:45:11,991
Get on it now or I'll fucking crush you!

889
00:45:12,054 --> 00:45:13,089
No.

890
00:45:13,689 --> 00:45:16,602
Jame, you can tell me.

891
00:45:16,659 --> 00:45:18,297
I mean, how bad could it be?

892
00:45:41,884 --> 00:45:42,919
What?

893
00:45:42,985 --> 00:45:44,396
Okay, she told him.

894
00:45:46,322 --> 00:45:47,858
What?

895
00:45:53,095 --> 00:45:54,904
You fuck your brother?

896
00:45:55,197 --> 00:45:56,767
Oh. my God!

897
00:45:58,734 --> 00:46:00,941
Fucking white people.

898
00:46:03,472 --> 00:46:06,476
I'm not looking so bad now, am I, Dad?

899
00:46:07,209 --> 00:46:08,517
I'm out of here.

900
00:46:08,577 --> 00:46:11,183
Mom, she started all this.

901
00:46:11,247 --> 00:46:13,659
I didn't want to. I'm still your little soldier, I...

902
00:46:13,849 --> 00:46:15,988
- Fuck!
- Take that uniform off.

903
00:46:16,051 --> 00:46:17,928
You're insulting us all.

904
00:46:17,987 --> 00:46:19,694
No, no, no. Don't you see?

905
00:46:20,222 --> 00:46:21,724
It's gonna be even better now.

906
00:46:22,491 --> 00:46:24,368
You're a mess, I'm a mess.

907
00:46:24,693 --> 00:46:27,503
Come on. Doc Shakalu, get your ass up here!

908
00:46:27,563 --> 00:46:29,270
I got to be part of this shit?

909
00:46:29,431 --> 00:46:30,501
Todd?

910
00:46:30,866 --> 00:46:32,243
Please.

911
00:46:38,641 --> 00:46:40,985
Come on, baby. Come on, Todd, let's do this.

912
00:46:41,043 --> 00:46:42,078
Yeah, yeah.

913
00:46:42,444 --> 00:46:45,254
No! Let's not do this.

914
00:46:45,681 --> 00:46:46,989
Okay?

915
00:46:47,449 --> 00:46:51,056
And for the record,
my name's not Todd Peterson.

916
00:46:51,553 --> 00:46:53,464
It's Han Solo.

917
00:46:53,522 --> 00:46:57,493
Named after the man who made
the Kessel Run in less than 12 parsecs.

918
00:46:57,559 --> 00:47:00,665
And I am a Berger, like my father before me.

919
00:47:00,930 --> 00:47:03,433
Also, I want to tell everyone here
that I've got a pretty huge

920
00:47:03,499 --> 00:47:05,536
New Kids on the Block tattoo on my back.

921
00:47:05,601 --> 00:47:07,842
The heads are warped,
but fuck you guys, it's funny.

922
00:47:08,003 --> 00:47:09,710
It is fucking hilarious.

923
00:47:09,905 --> 00:47:10,940
And Steve?

924
00:47:11,373 --> 00:47:14,911
Nothing personal, man, but I quit!

925
00:47:15,277 --> 00:47:17,621
No, no. Come on, Todd, don't be like that.

926
00:47:18,914 --> 00:47:20,587
We quit, too.

927
00:47:20,649 --> 00:47:21,719
Fuck you!

928
00:47:22,117 --> 00:47:23,323
Good call, Han Solo,

929
00:47:23,385 --> 00:47:25,524
<i>I I 1
cause your fiancee banged him, too.</i>

930
00:47:25,587 --> 00:47:26,588
What?

931
00:47:26,655 --> 00:47:28,566
I didn't know
about the brother thing, though.

932
00:47:28,624 --> 00:47:31,002
I am as sickened as you, believe me.

933
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:32,835
You know what? It's all right, Steve.

934
00:47:32,895 --> 00:47:34,033
'Cause guess what?

935
00:47:34,096 --> 00:47:36,633
Donny and Vanilla Ice fucked your mom!

936
00:47:37,866 --> 00:47:39,971
Vanilla Ice banged Grandma?

937
00:47:40,035 --> 00:47:42,345
That's fucking awesome!

938
00:47:45,007 --> 00:47:46,486
Donny, look out!

939
00:47:50,746 --> 00:47:52,487
Word to your mother, brotherfucker!

940
00:47:53,215 --> 00:47:55,161
I'm sorry.
I know I'm not supposed to hit a chick,

941
00:47:55,217 --> 00:47:57,060
but I got to tell you, it felt good.

942
00:47:57,119 --> 00:47:58,723
I mean, I wouldn't do it again,

943
00:47:58,787 --> 00:48:01,028
but with this psycho, you know,
it was warranted.

944
00:48:01,090 --> 00:48:02,694
Donny! I'm gonna kill you!

945
00:48:06,495 --> 00:48:07,997
At ease, bitch.

946
00:48:08,063 --> 00:48:10,600
Dude! That's it! Nice!

947
00:48:10,666 --> 00:48:11,838
Hang on, though. Hang on.

948
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,345
No, don't hurt me.

949
00:48:17,606 --> 00:48:19,108
Even Steven.

950
00:48:19,641 --> 00:48:22,178
Father, take off the collar.

951
00:48:23,012 --> 00:48:25,185
That's right. You're not meant for this.

952
00:48:26,382 --> 00:48:27,759
- Well...
- Yeah.

953
00:48:28,117 --> 00:48:29,460
Nicely done.

954
00:48:29,518 --> 00:48:30,963
All right, come on.

955
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,828
Let's get out of here, Dad.

956
00:48:34,023 --> 00:48:36,435
Did you hear that? Did you hear that?

957
00:48:36,492 --> 00:48:38,529
My son called me "Dad!"

958
00:48:39,161 --> 00:48:40,469
He called me "Dad!"

959
00:48:40,529 --> 00:48:42,975
That's right!
The Berger boys are back, bitches!

960
00:48:43,032 --> 00:48:44,875
Wassup?

961
00:48:45,167 --> 00:48:46,339
Wassup?

962
00:48:46,602 --> 00:48:48,206
Wassup...

963
00:48:56,378 --> 00:48:57,584
Shut up.

964
00:48:57,646 --> 00:48:59,956
His boss and her brother?

965
00:49:00,015 --> 00:49:01,619
It sounds like a Rodney Dangerfield joke,

966
00:49:01,683 --> 00:49:03,685
but it actually happened to my boy here!

967
00:49:04,086 --> 00:49:06,657
Now we got to find Han Solo
one of them new girls.

968
00:49:06,722 --> 00:49:08,668
One that don't care about
all that money he make.

969
00:49:08,724 --> 00:49:11,170
- No, no.
- Yeah, like a girl version

970
00:49:11,226 --> 00:49:13,331
-of Todd Bridges would be perfect.
- That's right!

971
00:49:13,395 --> 00:49:14,738
Female version of me. That's right.

972
00:49:14,797 --> 00:49:17,641
Well, you know, I actually might be
doing okay in that department, so...

973
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:18,935
What's that?

974
00:49:19,001 --> 00:49:20,173
What the fuck... What the heck?

975
00:49:20,235 --> 00:49:23,216
Todd and Brie, sitting in a tree.

976
00:49:23,472 --> 00:49:25,952
I have balls down to my knee!

977
00:49:26,408 --> 00:49:28,479
- What?
- He said it! Yeah!

978
00:49:28,944 --> 00:49:30,617
- Donny!
- Yeah, buddy?

979
00:49:30,946 --> 00:49:33,517
You're my best friend. I'm gonna miss you.

980
00:49:34,750 --> 00:49:36,229
I know, I know.

981
00:49:36,285 --> 00:49:37,355
But there's good news.

982
00:49:37,419 --> 00:49:39,490
You know what,
Miss McGarricle gets out in three years,

983
00:49:39,555 --> 00:49:42,968
so the timing's kind of perfect
for us to start our lives together.

984
00:49:43,225 --> 00:49:44,465
Dad, let me just give you the money.

985
00:49:44,726 --> 00:49:46,535
No. No. I'm not gonna do that.

986
00:49:46,595 --> 00:49:50,566
It's time for Donny Berger
to take responsibility for his screw-ups.

987
00:49:50,899 --> 00:49:53,436
I made my bed, now I got to lie in it.

988
00:49:53,702 --> 00:49:55,704
Donny! Donny! Are you watching?

989
00:49:55,771 --> 00:49:57,409
Turn on the TV! Turn it on!

990
00:49:57,673 --> 00:50:01,382
<i>There he is, the fat guy we've been
talking about all day, Tubby Tuke,</i>

991
00:50:01,443 --> 00:50:05,016
<i>actually gaining on the Ethiopians
here in the final stretch.</i>

992
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,356
Is this the fat guy I put the money on?

993
00:50:07,416 --> 00:50:09,362
Twenty bucks at 8,000-to-1.

994
00:50:10,486 --> 00:50:12,090
- A hundred and sixty grand?
- A hundred and sixty grand?

995
00:50:12,154 --> 00:50:13,656
Come on, you fat shit, move it!

996
00:50:13,789 --> 00:50:15,325
Go, Tubby! Go, Tubby!

997
00:50:15,724 --> 00:50:17,226
Keep running! Keep running!

998
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,901
Pass those Ethiopians!

999
00:50:20,195 --> 00:50:22,300
Pass them skinny fucking Ethiopians!

1000
00:50:24,366 --> 00:50:27,506
This defies every law of science,
but it's happening!

1001
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,712
Get the fuck up!

1002
00:50:32,774 --> 00:50:34,048
Get the fuck up!

1003
00:50:36,745 --> 00:50:38,383
He's up! He's up! He's up!

1004
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:43,921
- That'll replenish him! That'll replenish him!
- No!

1005
00:50:45,087 --> 00:50:46,566
<i>Listen to the roar of that crowd.</i>

1006
00:50:46,622 --> 00:50:48,101
Fat guy! Fat guy!

1007
00:50:48,157 --> 00:50:50,000
Fat guy! Fat guy!

1008
00:50:50,192 --> 00:50:51,762
<i>Can he possibly win it?</i>

1009
00:50:51,994 --> 00:50:53,029
He's gonna do it!

1010
00:50:55,063 --> 00:50:56,474
<i>Tubby Tuke has won!</i>

1011
00:51:02,971 --> 00:51:05,611
<i>Tubby Tuke wins! Tubby Tuke wins!</i>
