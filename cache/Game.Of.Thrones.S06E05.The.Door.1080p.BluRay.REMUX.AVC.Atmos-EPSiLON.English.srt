When I heard you had escaped Winterfell,
I feared the worst.

00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:54,050
You have no idea how happy I am
to see you unharmed.

What are you doing here?

12
00:02:59,764 --> 00:03:02,433
I rode north with the Knights of the Vale
to come to your aid.

13
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:05,227
They're encamped at Moat Cailin as we speak.

Did you know about Ramsay?

If you didn't know, you're an idiot.
If you did know, you're my enemy.

17
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:20,284
Would you like to hear
about our wedding night?

18
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,537
He never hurt my face.

19
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:27,124
He needed my face,
the face of Ned Stark's daughter.

20
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,382
But the rest of me,

21
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:37,176
he did what he liked with the rest of me

22
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:40,388
as long as I could still give him an heir.

23
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,017
What do you think he did?

24
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:53,150
- I can't begin to contemplate...
- What do you think he did to me?

25
00:04:01,617 --> 00:04:03,828
Lady Sansa asked you a question.

26
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:07,289
- He beat you.
- Yes, he enjoyed that.

27
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:09,166
What else do you think he did?

28

- LITTLEFINGER: Sansa, I...
- What else?

29
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:15,881
Did he cut you?

30
00:04:17,675 --> 00:04:19,427
Maybe you did know about Ramsay all along.

31
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,511
I didn't know.

32
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:22,596
I thought you knew everyone's secrets.

33
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,933
I made a mistake, a horrible mistake.

34
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,518
I underestimated a stranger.

35
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:30,646
The other things he did,

36
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,565
ladies aren't supposed to
talk about those things,

37
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:35,359
but I imagine brothel keepers
talk about them all the time.

38
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:40,531
I can still feel it.

39
00:04:40,865 --> 00:04:43,784
I don't mean in my tender heart
it still pains me so.

40
00:04:43,868 --> 00:04:48,205
I can still feel what he did in my body
standing here right now.

41
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:53,085
I'm so sorry.

42
00:04:53,169 --> 00:04:54,962
You said you would protect me.

43
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,088
LITTLEFINGER: And I will.

44
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,716
You must believe me
when I tell you that I will.

45
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,509
SANSA: I don't believe you anymore.

46
00:05:00,593 --> 00:05:04,305
I don't need you anymore.
You can't protect me.

47
00:05:04,388 --> 00:05:08,392
You won't even be able to protect yourself
if I tell Brienne to cut you down.

48
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,354
And why shouldn't I?

49
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,693
Do you want me to beg for my life?

50
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:20,488
If that's what you want, I will.

51
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:25,993
Whatever you ask that is in my power,
I will do.

What if I want you to die here and now?

53
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,459
Then I will die.

54
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:39,423
You freed me from the monsters
who murdered my family,

55
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:42,968
and you gave me to other monsters
who murdered my family.

56
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:47,139
Go back to Moat Cailin.

will take back the North on our own.

I never want to see you again.

59
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:54,688
I would do anything to undo
what's been done to you.

60

I know that I can't.

one more thing before I go?

Your great-uncle Brynden the Blackfish

and retaken Riverrun.

None of the first Faceless Men

I've got two fucking warts on my cock.

They usually go away in five or six years.

You need to know that
if we're going to be intimate.

She's jealous because Lady Crane is better.

Do not walk away from your queen,

You have not been dismissed.

You pledged yourself to me.

00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:05,411
You swore to obey my commands
for the rest of your life.

370
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:10,041
Well, I command you to find the cure,

wherever it is in this world.

372
00:29:16,464 --> 00:29:18,799
I command you to heal yourself,

373
00:29:20,176 --> 00:29:21,677
and then return to me.

374
00:29:25,014 --> 00:29:27,016
When I take the Seven Kingdoms,

375
00:29:28,267 --> 00:29:30,144
I need you by my side.

376
00:30:09,392 --> 00:30:12,979
In the last fortnight
since our pact with the Masters,

377
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:16,482
how many killings have been carried out
by the Sons of the Harpy?

378
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:17,650
None.

379
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:20,861
And how many Masters have been butchered
by the free men?

380
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:23,322
Two, but that was the day of the pact.

381
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:25,116
Since then, nothing.

382
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:28,494
So, it's safe to say
that a fragile peace has taken hold.

383
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:29,662
For now.

384
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:31,789
"For now" is the best
we get in our profession.

385
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:33,082
It's not enough.

386
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:35,084
Considering the city
was on the brink of civil war,

387
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,128
I'd say it's a good start.

388
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:39,422
It's not enough for Meereen to have peace.

389
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:42,258
They need to know
Daenerys is responsible for it.

390
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:45,011
The Sons of the Harpy have a good story.

391
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:47,304
Resist the foreign invaders.

392
00:30:47,388 --> 00:30:49,557

Breaker of Chains, all that.

394
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,856
The people know who brought them freedom.

395
00:30:56,939 --> 00:30:59,442
Yes, but do they know
who brought them security?

396
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:01,444
Who brought about an end to the violence?

397
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:04,155
We need someone the people trust,

398
00:31:04,447 --> 00:31:07,450
someone they know
cannot be bought or influenced.

399
00:31:08,075 --> 00:31:10,828
Sounds like quite the hero.
Where would we find him?

400
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:13,247
Who said anything about "him"?

I know from personal experience
how uncomfortable the journey can be.

The truth is we need your help.

We had hoped that
we could somehow persuade you to...

From the fire she was reborn
to remake the world.

She has freed the slaves from their chains

00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:32,493
a gift from the Lord of Light.

But you heard all of this before, haven't you?

On the Long Bridge of Volantis.

425
00:32:40,084 --> 00:32:43,504
The dragons will purify nonbelievers

burning their sins and flesh away.

427
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:51,095
Ideally we'd avoid
purifying too many nonbelievers.

The Mother of Dragons
has followers of many different faiths.

429

You want your queen
to be worshipped and obeyed.

430
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:01,772
And while she's gone, you want her advisors
to be worshipped and obeyed.

431
00:33:03,023 --> 00:33:05,276
I'd settle for obeyed.

That sounds most excellent.

A man named
Stannis Baratheon was anointed

438
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:26,547
as the chosen one by one of your priestesses.

439
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,383
He, too, had a glorious destiny.

440
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:31,260
He attacked King's Landing

441
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:34,889
and was soundly defeated
by the man standing beside me.

442
00:33:34,972 --> 00:33:37,474
Last I had heard, he had been defeated again,

443
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:41,645
this time at Winterfell, and this time for good.

444
00:33:41,729 --> 00:33:44,857
We'd be most grateful
for any support you could provide the queen.

445
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,610
I suppose it's hard
for a fanatic to admit a mistake.

446
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:51,530
Isn't that the whole point of being a fanatic?

447
00:33:51,614 --> 00:33:53,866
You're always right.

Everything is the Lord's will.

Even honest servants of the Lord.

452
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:09,465
And you, an honest servant of the Lord,

453
00:34:09,632 --> 00:34:14,011
why should I trust you to know any more
than the priestess who counseled Stannis?

454
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:17,223
My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion,

455

but we are all loyal supporters of the queen.

at the hand of a second-rate sorcerer,

461
00:34:43,374 --> 00:34:46,377
you wouldn't be here

when the sorcerer
tossed your parts in the fire?

467
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:10,651
You heard a voice call out from the flames.
Do you remember?

468
00:35:13,362 --> 00:35:15,698
Should I tell you what the voice said?

469
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:20,577
Should I tell you
the name of the one who spoke?

470

We serve the same queen.

He can now. His mark is on you.

484

You must leave, all of you.

485
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,878
Come on, Hodor. Help me with the sledge.

486
00:39:39,962 --> 00:39:40,963
Hodor.

487
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:44,216
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

488
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:47,052
- The time has come.
- The time for what?

489
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:50,222
For you to become me.

490
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,476
But am I ready?

491
00:39:55,477 --> 00:39:56,478
No.

492
00:39:58,981 --> 00:40:02,859
JON: We can't defend the North from
the Walkers and the south from the Boltons.

493
00:40:03,235 --> 00:40:07,197
If we want to survive, we need Winterfell,
and to take Winterfell, we need more men.

494
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:13,912
DAVOS: Aside from
the Starks and the Boltons,

495
00:40:13,996 --> 00:40:16,832
the most powerful houses in the North

496
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:20,419
are the Umbers, the Karstarks,
and the Manderlys.

497
00:40:20,794 --> 00:40:23,380
The Umbers and the Karstarks

498
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:26,925
have already declared for the Boltons,
so we're not doing so well there.

499
00:40:27,009 --> 00:40:29,845
The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies.
They can hang.

500
00:40:30,345 --> 00:40:34,725
But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay
without knowing they had another choice.

501
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:37,102
Uh, I beg your pardon, my lady,

502
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:40,397
but they know that
a Stark beheaded their father.

503
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,815
I don't think we can count on them either.

504
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:46,820
How well do you know the North, Ser Davos?

505
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:48,238
Precious little, my lady.

506
00:40:48,322 --> 00:40:50,741
SANSA: My father always said
Northerners are different.

507
00:40:51,033 --> 00:40:54,453
More loyal, more suspicious of outsiders.

508
00:40:54,536 --> 00:40:56,121
They may well be loyal,

509
00:40:56,204 --> 00:40:59,875
but how many rose up against the Boltons
when they betrayed your family?

510
00:41:02,252 --> 00:41:04,838
I may not know the North, but I know men.

511
00:41:05,631 --> 00:41:07,591
They're more or less the same
in any corner of the world

512
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:09,760
and even the bravest of them

513
00:41:09,885 --> 00:41:14,139
don't want to see their wives and children
skinned for a lost cause.

514
00:41:15,057 --> 00:41:17,601
If Jon's going to convince them
to fight alongside him,

515
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:19,645
they need to believe it's a fight they can win.

516
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:21,980
There are more than three other houses
in the North,

517
00:41:22,064 --> 00:41:26,777
Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn, Mazin, Hornwood.

518
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:27,986
Two dozen more.

519
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:30,405
Together they equal all the others.

520
00:41:30,572 --> 00:41:32,324
We can start small and build.

521
00:41:33,075 --> 00:41:34,242
SANSA: The North remembers.

522
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:36,495
They remember the Stark name.

523
00:41:36,578 --> 00:41:40,666
People will still risk everything for it,
from White Harbor to Ramsay's own door.

524
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:42,918
I don't doubt it.

525
00:41:43,585 --> 00:41:45,212
But Jon doesn't have the Stark name.

526
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:46,630
No, but I do.

527
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:54,429
Jon is every bit as much Ned Stark's son
as Ramsay is Roose Bolton's.

528
00:41:55,055 --> 00:41:57,015
And there are also the Tullys.
They're not Northern,

529
00:41:57,099 --> 00:41:59,935
but they will back us
against the Boltons without question.

530
00:42:00,018 --> 00:42:01,853
I didn't know the Tullys still had an army.

531
00:42:01,937 --> 00:42:04,773
My uncle the Blackfish has reformed it
and retaken Riverrun.

532
00:42:06,108 --> 00:42:07,192
How do you know that?

533
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:11,321
Ramsay received a raven
before I escaped Winterfell.

534
00:42:13,907 --> 00:42:15,450
That's good.

535
00:42:15,742 --> 00:42:19,121
The Blackfish is a legend.
His support would mean a great deal.

536
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:22,999
Stark, Tully, a few more houses,

537
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,335
almost starts to look like a winning side.

538
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:29,756
I've sworn to protect you, my lady.

539
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,593
You heard them. We need more men,
and my uncle has an army.

540
00:42:33,677 --> 00:42:35,137
We can send the Blackfish a raven.

541
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:39,141
Can't risk Ramsay intercepting it.
It has to be you.

542
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:40,225
Ride for Riverrun.

543
00:42:40,308 --> 00:42:43,645
My uncle will talk to you
and you'll know how to talk to him.

549
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,659
A bit brooding, perhaps.

550
