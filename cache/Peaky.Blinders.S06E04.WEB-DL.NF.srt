00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,000
You remember the girl
and the hazel tree, don't you, Tommy?

164
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,720
Whoever the boy is, Esme...

165
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,440
Whoever he is, our business is done here.

166
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,120
I brought you to this camp for a reason.
And I brought him as well.

167
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,240
He is yours.

168
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,120
A boy born with hazel eyes.

169
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,840
He calls himself Duke.

170
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,360
His mother is dead. He's a thief.

171
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,160
He works the fairground,

172
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,520
but he says he wants more to life
than big wheels and carousels.

173
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,000
If the losing of Ruby's
left a hole in your heart,

174
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,520
I'll send him to you.

175
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,680
If you give me a bit more gold.

176
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:12,280
I'll tell him Tommy Shelby can offer a man
far more than big wheels and carousels.

177
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,360
[exhales]

178
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,400
Is our business done or not, Tommy?

179
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,880
[Lizzie] I know where you went.

180
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,080
[exhales]

181
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,800
I'll spend more hours working
in the Commons with Mr Churchill.

182
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,000
His fight is my fight.

183
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,280
I sat like a stone and thought about you
killing someone in her name.

184
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,680
The Shelby institutions will be expanded.

185
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,320
I will set up a fund to research
the causes and cures of consumption.

186
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,360
Did the woman you killed have children?

187
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,480
Ten thousand children
die every year, Lizzie.

188
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,440
Go to bed, Tommy.

189
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,080
I've been reading about new research.

190
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,680
-Stop and close your fucking eyes.
-I will not...

191
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,040
I will not stop!

192
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,640
What is this "good" that you will become?!

193
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,360
[exhales]

194
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,200
I killed a woman.

195
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,680
I killed a woman and three men.

196
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,640
And their bodies will be thrown
aboard the boat like all the other bodies.

197
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,720
But I am stepping off that boat
and onto another boat.

198
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,360
Do you understand?!

199
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,480
Yeah.

200
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,599
The doctor from the sanatorium called

201
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,160
and said that he needs
to speak with you urgently.

202
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,359
But I think you're now
beyond the help of doctors.

203
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,280
Lizzie...

204
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,480
[Lizzie breathing heavily]

205
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,240
Frances said Arthur's here.

[switch flicks]

208
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,000
[Arthur] Tommy?

209
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,680
-Tom?
-[Tommy] Yeah, it's me.

210
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,080
[Arthur] Ah, fuck.

211
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,640
[Tommy exhales]

212
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,400
Arthur, give me a light, will you?

213
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,720
I can't find my lighter.

214
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,800

[sniffs]

216
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,200
Sorry I didn't speak at the wagon, Tom.

217
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,280
Don't be sorry.

218
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,040
What are you doing here?

219
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,760
Waiting for this fucking cup to fill up.

220
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,560
Nearly empty, this barrel.

221
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,200
[scoffs]

222
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,160
Plenty of barrels, Arthur.

223
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,760
Start another barrel.

224
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,320
I thought maybe
they were all full of fucking blood.

225
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,400
[breathes deeply]

226
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,400
The junk, Tom.

227
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,160
Fucks up your mind.

228
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,960
You know, Arthur,

229
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,280
you was already fucked up.

230
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,760
[exhales]

231
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,080
[Tommy] You was fucked up
since you was a kid.

232
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,520
This is my theory.

233
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,680
[clicks tongue]

234
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,240
It's from that time I gave you a beating,

235
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,200
when you was 12 and I was nine.

236
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,360
We were fighting over cigarettes.

237
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,360
Maybe while I had you down on the ground,

238
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,400
I gave you one too many to the head.

239
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,960
It was a draw, though, Tom.

240
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,480
Nah.

241
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,200
I beat you.

242
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,480
I had you pinned.

243
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,240
You actually didn't.

244
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,600
[chuckles softly]

245
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,960
We both agreed.

246
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,320
You're so fucked,
you can't remember, brother.

247
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,440
I do.

248
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,760
I do remember these little things.

249
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,400
[Tommy] I know you do.

250

So do I.

Hell, when Polly was gone, Arthur,

262
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,240
I thought I could just march and march.

263
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,440
I just kept up that fucking left-right,

264
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,280
left-right, left-right,
left-right fucking rhythm.

like a fucking tunneller...

-The family boat?
-Yeah.

the size of ten of these fucking barrels.

Hmm.

279
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,200
Remember that night

280
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,160
at Tile Cross?

281
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,440
Sixteen of us sleeping on the boat.

282

The coppers come.

Except for Arthur.

00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,960
with a boat hook, all on his own.

And I remember,

288
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,800
I climbed back up on the lock
and I looked back,

289
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,560
and I saw you
waving that fucking boat hook

290

in the coppers' faces...

That's when I realised...

294
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,280
when I had you on the ground,

295
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,800
all them years ago,

296
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,160
it's 'cause you let me win.

You've wanted me to win ever since.

start doing that again?

Huh?

303
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:21,800
You'll stop.

on the Dudley stretch.

Remember Dudley Canal, line number one,
3,172 yards of fucking pitch blackness?

-And rats swimming?
-Yeah.

00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,880
And then we come round the corner
and there'd be a shaft of light,

310
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,120
and then we'd know.

311

Yeah.

312
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,600
And then, you and me, we'd both know
it was nearly done.

That's where we are now, Arthur.

314

Just a few more yards to go.

315
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,160
And you will change your ways.

316
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,480
And I'll change the fucking world.

When you were X-rayed and examined

The tests suggest
that the shadow you can see

00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,640
Bouts of weakness?

652
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:31,520
Dissociation? Hallucinations?

653
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,360
-[grunts]
-Why didn't you come and see me?

654
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,520
I have work to do.

655
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,440
Am I a danger to others?

656
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:53,360
No.

657
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,880
Unlike TB, tuberculoma is not infectious.

658
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,840
Mr Shelby, it is not infectious,

659
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:06,480
but in your case,
I am afraid it is inoperable.

660
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,120
The growth is in your brainstem.

661
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:13,880
Any attempt to remove it would result
in trauma and brain haemorrhage.

662
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,360
Whilst you were refusing my calls,

663
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:23,720
I showed your X-rays to three
of the best surgeons in the country.

664
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,760
They all said they would not operate.

665
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:32,480
That it would be futile.

666
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:38,160
Of course, you will want
a second opinion for yourself.

667
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:42,320
Dr Helen Rutherford at St Thomas'.

668
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:43,880
She is a friend.

669
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,360
[clears throat]

670
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:56,320
This...

671
00:53:58,680 --> 00:53:59,920
How bad will it get?

672
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:07,800
As the tumour grows,

673
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,400
the rate of physical
and mental deterioration will increase.

674
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:21,040
Eventually, you will need
people around you constantly

675
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:23,600
who love you very much.

676
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,000
How long?

677
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:35,000
I understand that you have
defeated many enemies, Mr Shelby.

678
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,520
Now you have a new one.

679
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,560
Inside you.

680
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,560
You cannot defeat it.

681
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,120
But you can keep it at bay for a while.

682
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,920
If you live correctly,
if you are determined, and if you fight...

683
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:54,800
I asked you a question.
So I want an answer.

684
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,680
I don't want your fucking platitudes.

685
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:02,160
How long before I need people around me
who love me very much?

686
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:03,680
[door opens]

687
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:08,960
-Sorry.
-[Tommy] It's fine, Lizzie.

688
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,840
My accountant here was just leaving.

689
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:16,440
[clears throat]

690
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,960
I will telephone you
when I get back to London.

691
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,160
No, don't have enough time.

692
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,560
You're an accountant,
give me a fucking number now.

693
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:25,560
[Holford] One year.

694
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,200
Perhaps 18 months.

695
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,760
[clicks tongue] That's fine.
That's all I need to know.

696
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:34,720
I will adjust
my finances accordingly. Thank you.

697
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:39,120
I will write you,
explaining the full implications.

698
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,320
Yep, thank you.

699
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:45,760
Good day.

700
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:55,800
Something serious?

701
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:58,640
No. No, just a...

702
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,240
Just a bill I wasn't expecting, and I...

703
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:04,800
I'll have to pay it.

704
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:17,160
Can you give me
a minute on my own, Lizzie?

705
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:22,120
Yeah.

706
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:31,800
[door closes]

707
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:38,920
I'm not a devil.

708
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:44,000
Just an ordinary, mortal man.

709
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:53,360
[Polly] <i>There will be a war in this family</i>

710
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:56,920
<i>and one of you will die.</i>

711
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:00,640
[Tommy] Polly...

712
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:05,360
Just give me enough time
to do what I have to do.

713
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:11,040
[Polly] <i>Kill and kill...</i>
