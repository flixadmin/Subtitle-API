1
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,580
Why don't you want to talk to me?

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,560
I think I was raped by William's brother.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,880
Is there no one else you can ask?
Someone who was at the party?

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:21,400
There was a girl from our school. Mari.

5
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,460
Tell me you didn't sleep with my brother.

6
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,040
I don't know.

7
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,460
Yes?

8
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,720
Hi.

9
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,740
Hi.

10
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,500
Are you up for a visit from a friend?

11
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,880
What are you doing?

12
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:31,500
I'm just throwing 
out a lot of shit I don't need.

13
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,160
You had such long hair.

14
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,540
When is this from?

15
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,940
Ninth grade.

16
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,680
Have you heard something from William?

17
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,120
Eva talked to Penetrator Chris,
and he said William has gone to London.

18
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,820
His father lives there.

19
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:55,840
I'm sure it's just for the weekend.
They have exams next week.

20
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,660
He has to take the exam.

21
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,380
I will talk to Mari tomorrow.

22
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,280
You will?

23
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:26,000
I sent her a message asking if we could talk.

24
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:34,080
We'll just cross our fingers hoping she's a little cool.

25
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,500
Just not so cool that
I would've slept with her as well.

26
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:51,820
What do you want to find out?

27
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,640
Are you hungry?

28
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,340
Eh, no.

29
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,540
I've made something nice for you.

30
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,160
Vilde, I've already eaten.

31
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,980
Do you like tortilla?

32
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:26,700
What's so good about tortilla,
is that it's made from potatoes.

33
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,940
And your body needs potatoes.

34
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:43,420
Because potatoes have
lots of starch, which give you energy.

35
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,580
And vitamin C,
which is a antioxidant.

36
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,580
Antioxidants help you
so you don't get old skin.

37
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,000
You don't want to have old skin
when you get together with William again.

38
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,600
Then we need to eat tortilla!

39
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:15,240
<i>[He didn't show up to his exam today. Chris says he
can't reach him either.]</i>

40
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,180
What's up?

41
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,020
Hi.

42
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:30,760
Thank you for wanting to meet me.
-Of course.

43
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,860
You're paranoid about 
Nico's party?

44
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,640
Yes.

45
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,740
Don't be. You were just sweet.

46
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,880
Do you know if I slept with William?

47
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:01,980
No.

48
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,700
You don't know.

49
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,900
No, you didn't.

50
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,420
Are you sure?

51
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:14,960
Yes.

52
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,880
But... oh my god. Okay.

53
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,740
But did I sleep with someone else?
-No.

54
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,600
You were really stressed out, weren't you?

55
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:38,400
Yeah, I woke up naked!
-You undressed yourself!

56
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,960
I got undressed?!

57
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,680
You seriously don't remember anything?

58
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:50,300
No! Can you just explain everything now?

59
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:55,900
Okay. Do you remember
throwing up on the sofa upstairs?

60
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,140
No..

61
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:04,540
You threw up on the sofa upstairs.
I took you to the toilet.

62
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:09,420
You threw up again,
so we drank some water.

63
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:14,000
Then you said you wanted
to lie in William's bed. Remember that?

64
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,620
No..

65
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,780
You were really obsessing over William.

66
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,880
How so?

67
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,700
You said you loved him..

68
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:38,860
.. and that he wasn't good because he was an asshole. You didn't 
want to be that girl who falls for such a guy.

69
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:44,840
You smelled his pillow and said it
smelled like him. You wanted to sleep in his bed..

70
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:49,220
.. and you began to undress yourself completely.

71
00:08:53,960 --> 00:09:02,860
You said last time you were in his bed,
he said that all your clothes would be off within two weeks.

72
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:08,040
You said it wasn't going to happen,
but that he had meant it.

73
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,480
But that really deep inside
you hoped he was right.

74
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,340
Now he had been right in a way.
Then you passed out.

75
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,880
But I woke up in bed next to Nico.

76
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,300
Yeah, but he came in much later.

77
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,200
But how do you
know he didn't do anything?

78
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:54,160
Because when Nico came, I was awake. I asked him to go 
lie somewhere else. But then he passed out and fell asleep.

79
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,480
But maybe he did
something while you were sleeping.

80
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,460
Noora..

81
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:09,820
Nico was really fucked up. He wouldn't have even
managed to get a boner.

82
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,660
Just forget it, really.

83
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,060
I would have noticed if
someone had sex next to me.

84
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,600
You didn't sleep with Nico.

85
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,880
I'm totally sure.

86
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,100
But he took pictures of me.

87
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,040
What kind of pictures?

88
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,040
Naked pictures. While I was asleep.

89
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,180
Are you kidding?

90
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,820
I reported him.

91
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,960
Nico, poor guy.

92
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,840
Poor guy? Seriously?

93
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,200
I remember when I was little,
I used to be scared of him.

94
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:02,260
I'm not scared of him any longer.
I think I just pity him.

95
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,400
But not like that. It was right
of you to report him.

96
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:11,460
Did you know him when you were little?

97
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:18,820
I went to kindergarten with Amalie, 
his little sister. She was my best friend.

98
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,900
Oh yeah?

99
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:33,200
I know Nico hasn't had an easy life.
He has a different father than William and Amalie.

100
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:39,880
His real father never wanted anything
to do with him. Neither did William and Amalie's father.

101
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:44,300
And their mother is
just really cowardly and weak.

102
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:51,440
When Nico was little he got
these really sick tantrums. He snapped completely.

103
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:58,820
Instead of trying to calm him down and 
understand him, his mom would lock him in his room.

104
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:06,380
Music at full blast, so no one would hear him. She went 
around smiling nervously and pretending nothing had happened.

105
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,160
It was really intereseting to
have dinner there, so to speak.

106
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,260
After the accident she just 
really abandoned both her sons.

107
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,560
Just left them to the au pairs.

108
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,040
I know Nico doesn't have any contact with her.

109
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,060
I don't think William has, either.
If he does, it's not much.

110
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,140
Accident?

111
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,300
When Nico was eleven..

112
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,720
.. he stole his stepdad's
car and crashed it into a cliff.

113
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,920
With William and Amalie in it.

114
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,760
It wasn't his intention.
He was just a kid.

115
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:11,320
But Amalie broke
her back and died.

116
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,620
Fucking hell..

117
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:31,560
Yeah, it's quite dark.
They were eight years old.

118
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,820
After that pretty much
the whole family was fucked up.

119
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,080
But William is a good guy.

120
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:53,500
I understand you think he's an asshole,
but he's actually really sensitive.

121
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,440
He just keeps everything inside.

122
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,660
Does it sting?
-It itches.

123
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,500
It stings when I touch it.

124
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,180
You can't touch it.

125
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,240
That's why you got it.
-Huh?

126
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,640
If you touch there, you get it there.

127
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,260
What are you talking about?
-You can't touch it on your fiffi.

128
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,520
Fiffi?

129
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,560
It Swedish for vagina.

130
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:25,720
<i>[Hello. I was down in our basement and it looks like someone is living and sleeping 
there. There's a mattress, a duvet, pillows and stuff on the floor. Do you know anything about it?]</i>

131
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,900
On (pocketdoctor.com) it says you can get chlamydia in your eye.

Don't touch me!

137
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,600
I promise it's not chlamydia.

(These texts won't fit on the screen, try to put it through Google Translate lol.)

139
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,300
But who did you have sex with?

140

(These texts won't fit on the screen, try to put it through Google Translate lol.)

141
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,640
Had sex with?
-Yeah, you said you had sex with him.
(These texts won't fit on the screen, try to put it through Google Translate lol.)

142
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:55,960
(These texts won't fit on the screen, try to put it through Google Translate lol.)

143
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,780
After the party.
(These texts won't fit on the screen, try to put it through Google Translate lol.)

144
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,420
(These texts won't fit on the screen, try to put it through Google Translate lol.)

145
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,180
Vilde, I didn't say we had sex.
I just said..

146
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,100
.. that he fingered me a little
on the taxi. We didn't have sex.

147
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,040
William's at school! He went into
the headmaster's office.

148
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,020
Excuse me, I was just wondering..
Is William..

149
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,320
You haven't replied to my messages.

150
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,440
My phone was dead.

151
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,280
I didn't sleep with your brother.

152
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,480
Can we talk?

153
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,560
I'm moving..

154
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,100
.. to London.

155
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,740
Listen up.

156
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,960
William Magnusson.

157
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,660
You're a smart guy.

158
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,840
So you ought to understand..

159
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:25,880
.. that I would never just
let you move to London.

160
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,700
Not before we've talked.

161
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,200
So if you really want to get rid of me..

162
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,800
You should meet me for a talk.

163
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,480
Stop feeling so
damn sorry for yourself.

164
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,220
Okay.

165
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,760
I'll text you.

166
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,700
<i>[I'm outside of your apartment now. You 
wanted to talk? I don't have much time.]</i>

167
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,560
You weren't kidding when 
you said you don't have much time.

168
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,480
Plane leaves at six.

169
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,020
You want to talk?

170
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,360
Why do you have to go to London?

171
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,620
Because I want to.

172
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,720
How long will you be there?

173
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,280
I think the rest of my life.

174
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,800
What about us?

175
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,780
What about us?

176
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,380
Is it just over?

177
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,400
Yes.

178
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,520
Just like that?

179
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,320
I'm not in love with you.

180
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,060
You are..

181
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,340
You are in love with me..

182
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,060
That's why you're being so cold.

183
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,960
No, Noora.

184
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,360
I'm cold because that's how I am.

185
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:58,020
I always wondered why you're so smart.

186
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,820
Just to defend your asshole
behavior to yourself?

187
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:11,000
You just tell yourself that's how you are?

188
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,700
Is it because your mom is a cunt?

189
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,500
Because you had a tragic childhood?

190
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:40,460
Is that what you say to yourself? That you're so sorry
for yourself that you just can't fault your own behavior?

191
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,840
Anyway, it's not true.

192
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:59,320
People experience horrible things every day,
and they still manage to be nice to others.

193
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:08,060
Being an asshole is not something
you're born with, or something you become.

194
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,020
It's a choice.

195
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:20,480
It's also a choice to let
Nico destroy what there is between us.

196
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:31,020
What's the plan?

197
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:36,340
Were you just gonna go around London being
an asshole, because your brother is mean?

198
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,300
Because your girl lied to you?

199
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:48,460
Are you never letting anyone in
again because you might get hurt?

200
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:06,580
Believe me..
You don't want that.

201
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,500
It's really lonely.

202
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,300
Because people..

203
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,260
.. need people.

204
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,100
I love you.

205
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,160
And you love me.

206
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,700
We have to be together.

207
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:25,040
Tell me we should be together.

208
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,440
I have to go.

209
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,620
Eva?

210
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,740
William has left.

211
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:44,720
William broke up with me.
William has left to London.

212
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,520
Fuck, he left to..

213
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:54,180
He came here. We were going to meet.
 He came here..

214
00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:03,200
.. in Chris' car. He said he wasn't in love with
me anymore, and his flight would leave at six.

215
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:09,980
No, he said he
wasn't in love with me anymore.

216
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:21,160
Because he wanted to..
Can I come to you?
