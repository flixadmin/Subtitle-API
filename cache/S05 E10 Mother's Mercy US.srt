1
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,006
Replace the wheel.

2
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,762
The Lord of Light has made good
on his promise, my king.

3
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:19,056
His fires have melted the snows away.

4
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:22,643
-The way ahead is clear.
-We ride for Winterfell.

5
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,102
And you will take it.

6
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:29,024
The Lord has shown me
Bolton banners burning.

7
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:31,735
You will receive what is yours by right.

8
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,968
-Your Grace.
-Prepare to form up.

9
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:57,344
Your Grace.

10
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:03,559
-Tell me.
-The men…

11
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,811
many deserted before dawn.

12
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,608
-How many?
-Nearly half.

13
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:15,153
All the sellswords with all the horses.

14
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,374
Your Grace.

15
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:33,046
Speak up. Can't be worse than mutiny.

16
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:05,412
Cut her down.

17
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:20,218
Your Grace.

18
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,972
The Lady Melisandre
was just seen riding out of camp.

19
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:38,528
Get the men
into marching formation.

20
00:04:40,739 --> 00:04:42,074
On to Winterfell.

21
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:48,455
He raised his hands…

22
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:51,959
and they all stood up at once.

23
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:58,048
Tens of thousands of them.
The biggest army in the world.

24
00:04:59,049 --> 00:04:59,967
So what are you gonna do?

25
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:06,014
I'm gonna hope they don't learn
how to climb the Wall.

26
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,142
But the dragonglass…

27
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:12,437
No one's ever getting that back now.

28
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:16,358
It wouldn't have mattered anyway.
Not unless we had a mountain of it.

29
00:05:16,692 --> 00:05:20,404
-But you killed a White Walker.
-With Longclaw.

30
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:25,283
I saw them shatter steel axes
like they were glass but Longclaw--

31
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,452
Is Valyrian steel.

32
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:30,205
How many Valyrian steel swords
are left in the Seven Kingdoms?

33
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:31,206
Not enough.

34
00:05:34,668 --> 00:05:36,086
The first Lord Commander in history

35
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:40,382
to sacrifice the lives of sworn brothers
to save the lives of wildlings.

36
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:47,097
How's it feel to be friends
with the most hated man in Castle Black?

37
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,599
You were friends with me
when I first came here.

38
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,727
And I wasn't winning
any elections back then.

39
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:53,103
Here's to us, then.

40
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,023
Long may they sneer.

41
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:05,741
What?

42
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,412
I wanted to ask you something.

43
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:13,665
To ask something of you.

44
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:21,631
Send me, Gilly, and the baby to Oldtown
so I can become a maester.

45
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:26,803
-That's what I'm meant to be. Not this.
-I need you here, Sam.

46
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,599
If you leave, who's left
to give me advice I trust?

47
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:33,351
Well, there's Edd.

48
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:39,107
I'd be more use to you as a maester.

49
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:42,194
More use to everyone now
Maester Aemon's gone.

50
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:46,073
The Citadel has the world's
greatest library.

51
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:51,411
I'll learn about history, strategy,
healing.

52
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,415
And other things,
things that will help when…

53
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:58,210
when they come.

54
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:03,757
If Gilly stays here, then she'll die.

55
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,803
And the baby that she named
after me will die.

56
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,765
And I'll end up dying, too,
trying to protect them.

57
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,812
Which means that the last thing
that I'll see in this world

58
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,731
will be the look in her eyes
when I fail them.

59
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,697
And I'd rather see
a 1000 White Walkers than see that.

60
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,089
Thank you.

61
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,552
You know that the Citadel will make you
swear off women, too.

62
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,303
Oh, they'll bloody try.

63
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:56,560
-Sam.
-What?

64
00:07:58,770 --> 00:07:59,688
Sam.

65
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,276
You had just been beaten half to death.
How did you--

66
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:05,569
Oh, very carefully.

67
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:11,158
I'm glad the end of the world's
working out well for someone.

68
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:17,873
I'll come back.

69
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:21,459
To your return.

70
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:23,837
To my return.

71
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,689
Aye, this way.

72
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,517
My lady!

73
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:48,565
Stannis. Stannis Baratheon is coming.
His whole army.

74
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:50,066
How do you know it's Stannis?

75
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,570
They're carrying his flaming heart
banners. From the Blackwater.

76
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:55,572
I'll never forget it.

77
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:33,902
Trench here.

78
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:37,906
Another one 300 yards
from the castle wall. Hurry them along.

79
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:40,408
-Right, Curlew.
-Yes, sir.

80
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:41,868
Dig between those two rises.

81
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,703
-Spread out.
-I'm with you.

82
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,039
-Archers!
-Spread out!

83
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:50,168
And send out a foraging party
immediately. Siege begins at sunrise.

84
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,254
There's not going to be a siege,
Your Grace.

85
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,673
We've got no chance!

86
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,594
They've got twice as many men,
we're outnumbered!

87
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,328
No, please, please.

88
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:44,634
Bolton has women fighting for him?

89
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:47,929
I don't fight for the Boltons.

90
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,057
I'm Brienne of Tarth.

91
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,104
I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon.

92
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:05,863
I was there when he was murdered
by a shadow with your face.

93
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:12,287
You murdered him with blood magic?

94
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,377
I did.

95
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:32,974
In the name of Renly of House Baratheon,
First of His Name,

96
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:36,185
rightful King of the Andals
and the First Men,

97
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:39,689
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
and Protector of the Realm,

98
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,900
I, Brienne of Tarth, sentence you to die.

99
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:51,618
Do you have any last words?

100
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:02,503
Go on, do your duty.

101
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:22,732
Looks like we're done here.

102
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:43,878
-I surrender! I surrender!
-And I accept your surrender.

103
00:16:56,474 --> 00:17:00,019
Let's head back. My wife must be lonely.

104
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:37,265
My lady. I've come to escort you back
to your chamber.

105
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,517
Go with her, please.

106
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,398
I know what Ramsay is.

107
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,693
I know what he'll do to me.

108
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:53,823
If I'm going to die,

109
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:57,410
let it happen
while there's still some of me left.

110
00:18:00,121 --> 00:18:01,038
Die?

111
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:04,125
Who said anything about dying?

112
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:08,713
You can't die. Your father was Warden
of the North. Ramsay needs you.

113
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,676
Though I suppose
he doesn't need all of you.

114
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:17,388
Just the parts he'll use
to make his heir,

115
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:20,641
until you've given him a boy or two
and he's finished using them.

116
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:26,856
Then he's got incredible plans
for those parts.

117
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:32,153
So, shall we wait for him to come back
or should we begin now?

118
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,199
You're leaving it to me?

119
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:39,994
Good. Let's begin.

120
00:18:43,206 --> 00:18:46,375
Reek… stop! Stop!

121
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,426
Open the gate!

122
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:04,727
He's coming back.

123
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,242
I can see I have my work cut out for me.

124
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,287
You two, out.

125
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,718
You were the first person on my list,
you know.

126
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:46,180
For killing Syrio Forel. Remember him?

127
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:49,308
Probably not.

128
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:53,437
I've gotten a few of the others.

129
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,441
The Many-Faced God stole
a few more from me.

130
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,528
But I'm glad he left me you.

131
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,117
Do you know who I am?

132
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,123
I can't hear you.

133
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,009
You know who I am.

134
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:25,761
I'm Arya Stark.

135
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,105
Do you know who you are?

136
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:40,693
You're no one.

137
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:44,071
You're nothing.

138
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:30,034
A girl has taken a life.

139
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:32,703
The wrong life.

140
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:38,167
-I was right about her.
-You were.

141
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:41,337
You're not ready.

142
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:44,882
Not at all.

143
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,680
That man's life was not yours to take.

144
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,434
A girl stole from the Many-Faced God.

145
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,562
Now a debt is owed.

146
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:07,196
Only death can pay for life.

147
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:26,173
No! No! No, you… don't die! Don't die!

148
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:32,763
Why are you crying?

149
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:39,436
-He was my friend.
-No, he wasn't. Didn't you listen to him?

150
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:42,022
He was no one.

151
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:47,862
But if you're…

152
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,534
-who's this?
-No one at all.

153
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:57,538
Just as a girl should have been
before she took a face from the hall.

154
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,546
The faces are for no one.

155
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,424
You are still someone.

156
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:15,139
And to someone,
the faces are as good as poison.

157
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:29,695
I can't see.

158
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,328
What's happening?

159
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:40,497
What's happening?

160
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:53,719
-I wish you a safe journey home.
-Thank you.

161
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:00,017
Forgive me, child.

162
00:26:02,645 --> 00:26:04,730
I wish you all the happiness
in the world.

163
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:26,669
-Maybe I'll come visit you sometime.
-Maybe I'll come visit you.

164
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:30,047
Don't wait too long.
Got a noblewoman to marry back home.

165
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:34,760
You want a good girl,
but you need the bad pussy.

166
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:40,182
Whenever you're ready, my lord.

167
00:26:56,991 --> 00:26:58,575
Try not to lose it this time.

168
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,246
I'll never take it off again.

169
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,582
I know you didn't want to leave Dorne,

170
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:10,754
but I'm glad you're coming home.
Your mother's desperate to see you.

171
00:27:11,088 --> 00:27:14,341
And I'm glad Trystane is coming with us.
He seems like a nice boy.

172
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:19,179
You're lucky. Arranged marriages
are rarely so…

173
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:23,392
-so well arranged.
-Do you think Mother will like him?

174
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:28,480
If she sees you're happy,
I'm sure she will.

175
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:30,357
You really believe that?

176
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:34,069
Have you ever known your mother
to like anyone aside from her children?

177
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:39,158
-She likes you.
-I'm not so sure about that.

178
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,285
Listen…

179
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,581
there's something I wanted to tell you.

180
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:49,126
Something I should have told you long ago.

181
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:51,712
So…

182
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:56,425
now that you've seen more of the world,

183
00:27:57,301 --> 00:28:02,431
you've learned how complicated things
can be, people can be.

184
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:06,602
The Lannisters and the Martells
have hated each other for years,

185
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,771
but you've fallen in love with Trystane.

186
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:11,190
It was an accident, really.
I mean, what were the chances?

187
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:15,444
You happen to fall in love with the man
you were assigned to marry?

188
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:16,987
My point is…

189
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,492
we don't choose whom we love.

190
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:24,411
It just, well…

191
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:30,501
it's beyond our control.
I sound like an idiot.

192
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:32,753
-No, you don't.
-What I'm trying to say…

193
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,422
what I'm trying and failing to say--

194
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:38,258
-I know what you're trying to say.
-No, I'm afraid you don't.

195
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,427
I do.

196
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,099
I know.

197
00:28:46,809 --> 00:28:47,935
About you and Mother.

198
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:52,689
I think a part of me always knew.

199
00:28:54,942 --> 00:28:57,653
And I'm glad.

200
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,991
I'm glad that you're my father.

201
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:39,319
Myrcella?

202
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:44,074
Myrcella?

203
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,917
Myrcella? Myrcella?

204
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:13,956
You love her, don't you?

205
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:19,586
How could you not?

206
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,131
Of course it's hopeless
for the both of you.

207
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,135
A sellsword from the fighting pits,
a disgraced knight.

208
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,930
Neither one of you is fit consort
for a queen.

209
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:35,310
But we always want the wrong woman.

210
00:31:36,645 --> 00:31:37,980
Does he always talk so much?

211
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:45,571
-Jorah the Andal.
-Torgo Nudho.

212
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:48,574
-He should not be here.
-No, but he is.

213
00:31:48,657 --> 00:31:53,370
-Our queen ordered him exiled from city.
-Our queen would be dead if not for him.

214
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:18,520
...Thank you.

215
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:24,151
I am sorry. Sorry I not there
to fight for our queen.

216
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:26,945
-You missed a good scrap.
-None of that matters now.

217
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:28,655
The longer we sit here bantering,

218
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:30,907
the longer Daenerys is out there
in the wilderness.

219
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,577
He's right. The dragon headed north.

220
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,579
If we're going to find her,
that's where we'll have to go.

221
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:36,622
We?

222
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:41,501
You're a Lannister. The queen intends
to remove your family from power.

223
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:45,297
-And I intend to help her do it.
-You've been here for how many days now?

224
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:49,468
I've fought for her for years.
Since she was little more than a child.

225
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:51,678
-You betrayed her.
-Careful now.

226
00:32:51,762 --> 00:32:55,515
-And she exiled you. Twice, I believe.
-The second time thanks to you.

227
00:32:55,599 --> 00:33:00,896
-Don't blame me for your crimes, Mormont.
-He's right. Our queen exiled Jorah.

228
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,939
And he's right. Jorah saved her life.

229
00:33:03,649 --> 00:33:05,776
Perhaps she feels differently
about him now.

230
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:08,654
Perhaps not. The only way
we'll know is if we ask her.

231
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:11,990
Fine, fine. I suppose he can join us.

232
00:33:12,074 --> 00:33:14,701
Just as long as he promises
not to kill me in my sleep.

233
00:33:14,785 --> 00:33:17,454
If I ever kill you,
your eyes will be wide open.

234
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:20,332
Forgive me, but why would we bring you?

235
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,586
-Pardon me?
-Have you ever tracked animals

236
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:25,754
in the wilderness?

237
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,507
Not precisely, but I have other skills
that would be useful.

238
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,508
Can you fight?

239
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:33,804
I have fought. I don't claim
to be a great warrior.

240
00:33:33,887 --> 00:33:37,140
-Are you good on a horse?
-Middling.

241
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:41,812
-So mainly you talk.
-And drink. I've survived so far.

242
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:44,815
Which I respect, but you would not help
us on this expedition.

243
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:48,985
You would help us here
in Meereen, though.

244
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:52,781
None of us have experience
governing a city except for him.

245
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,117
You want to prove your value
to the queen?

246
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,660
Prove it right here in Meereen.

247
00:33:56,743 --> 00:33:59,287
He's a foreign dwarf
that barely speaks the language.

248
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:00,831
Why would the Meereenese
listen to him?

249
00:34:00,914 --> 00:34:04,584
They wouldn't.
They will listen to Grey Worm.

250
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:10,006
-I'll come with you. I'll find our queen.
-You are not strong enough to go anywhere.

251
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,967
-I am.
-He is. He's the toughest man

252
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:15,053
with no balls I ever met.
But you still can't go.

253
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:17,514
The people believe in you.

254
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:21,268
-They know you speak for the queen.
-It's true.

255
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,854
Only the Unsullied can keep
the peace in Meereen.

256
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:26,857
If you leave, half this city will consume
the other half.

257
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:28,775
And Missandei.

258
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:34,030
Our queen trusts no one more
than Missandei. Certainly not me.

259
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,744
The queen's closest confidante,
the commander of the Unsullied…

260
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,622
and a foreign dwarf with a scarred face.

261
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:47,753
Good fortune, my friends.
Meereen is ancient and glorious.

262
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:49,629
Try not to ruin her.

263
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,049
Looks like it's you and me,
Jorah the Andal.

264
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:57,471
Let's find some good horses.
We have so much to talk about.

265
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:32,380
Hello, old friend.

266
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:38,095
I thought we were so happy together
until you abandoned me.

267
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,933
I suppose there's no point
asking how you found me.

268
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:45,435
The birds sing in the west,
the birds sing in the east,

269
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:47,187
if one knows how to listen.

270
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:51,983
They tell me you've already found favor
with the Mother of Dragons.

271
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:57,197
Well, she didn't execute me,
so that's a promising start.

272
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:02,536
Now the heroes are off to find her
and I'm stuck here,

273
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:06,289
trying to placate a city
on the brink of civil war.

274
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:09,835
-Any advice for an old comrade?
-Information is the key.

275
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:12,671
You need to learn your enemy's strengths
and strategies.

276
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:15,715
You need to learn which
of your friends are not your friends.

277
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:20,595
If only I knew someone
with a vast network of spies.

278
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:21,763
If only.

279
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:25,809
A grand old city…

280
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:29,855
choking on violence, corruption,
and deceit.

281
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:35,819
Who could possibly have any experience
managing such a massive, ungainly beast?

282
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,410
I did miss you.

283
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:46,162
Oh, I know.

284
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,811
We have to go home.

285
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,695
Oh, my poor, sweet thing.

286
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:21,364
Does it hurt?

287
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:26,036
We have to go home.

288
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:32,792
Drogon. Can you take me back to Meereen?

289
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:39,299
How far did you carry me?

290
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:52,020
Drogon, we need to return.
My people need me.

291
00:38:24,678 --> 00:38:25,679
Well, there's no food.

292
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:29,808
At the very least,
you could hunt us some supper.

293
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:09,008
Confess.

294
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,347
Confess.

295
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:29,320
I have sinned. I see that now.

296
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:33,408
How can I have been so blind
for so long?

297
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:37,287
I want to be clean again.

298
00:41:39,414 --> 00:41:40,707
I want absolution.

299
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:46,379
The Crone came to me
with her lamp raised high.

300
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:50,216
-And by its holy light--
-You wish to make a confession?

301
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:57,140
Once I've confessed, will I be free?

302
00:41:57,223 --> 00:42:00,143
Your Grace will be dealt
with according to her sins.

303
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:03,980
The Mother have mercy, then.

304
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:10,320
I lay with a man outside the bonds
of marriage. I confess.

305
00:42:10,403 --> 00:42:11,321
Name him.

306
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:20,455
-Lancel Lannister.
-Your cousin and the king's squire.

307
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:23,249
-I was lonely and afraid.
-You had a husband.

308
00:42:23,333 --> 00:42:27,420
-A husband off whoring every chance he--
-His sins do not pardon your own.

309
00:42:30,632 --> 00:42:32,133
May the gods forgive me.

310
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:35,678
Other men?

311
00:42:37,764 --> 00:42:40,517
-No.
-No others?

312
00:42:42,769 --> 00:42:43,686
No.

313
00:42:44,354 --> 00:42:47,440
Speaking falsehoods
before the Gods is a great crime.

314
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,318
-You understand this?
-I do.

315
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:57,116
There are those that say your children
were not fathered by King Robert,

316
00:42:57,909 --> 00:43:01,913
that they are bastards
born of incest and adultery.

317
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:05,792
A lie.
A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon.

318
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:08,711
He wants the throne, but his brother's
children stand in his way.

319
00:43:08,795 --> 00:43:10,755
So he claims they are not his brother's.

320
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:13,091
That filth.

321
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:18,763
There is not one shred of truth to it.
I deny it.

322
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:22,767
Good.

323
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:26,688
But these are terrible charges.

324
00:43:27,939 --> 00:43:29,899
And the realm must know
the truth of them.

325
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,819
If Your Grace has given
honest testimony,

326
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:37,115
-your trial will prove your innocence.
-Trial? I have confessed.

327
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:40,785
To a single sin. Others you have denied.

328
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,789
Your trial will separate the truths
from the falsehoods.

329
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,627
I bow to the wisdom
of Your High Holiness.

330
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:53,798
But if I might beg…

331
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:57,051
for just one drop of the Mother's mercy.

332
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:01,556
I haven't seen my son…

333
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:07,228
I don't know how long it's been.
I need to see him, please.

334
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:10,815
You have taken the first step
on the path back to righteousness.

335
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:14,235
In light of this,

336
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,613
I will permit you to return
to the Red Keep.

337
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:21,284
Thank you.

338
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:25,246
-Thank you.
-The Mother is merciful.

339
00:44:26,456 --> 00:44:29,167
-It is her you should thank.
-I will. I will.

340
00:44:30,293 --> 00:44:31,711
I swear it, day and night.

341
00:44:34,464 --> 00:44:35,381
Good.

342
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:40,303
Am I free to go?

343
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:43,681
After your atonement.

344
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:47,852
My atonement?

345
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:05,239
A sinner comes before you.

346
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:09,494
Cersei of House Lannister.

347
00:47:10,703 --> 00:47:15,500
Mother to His Grace King Tommen.
Widow of His Grace King Robert.

348
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:21,464
She has committed the acts
of falsehood and fornication.

349
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:27,136
She has confessed her sins
and begged for forgiveness.

350
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,847
To demonstrate her repentance,

351
00:47:29,931 --> 00:47:34,018
she will cast aside all pride,
all artifice,

352
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:38,856
and present herself as the gods made her
to you,

353
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:45,154
the good people of the city.
She comes before you with a solemn heart,

354
00:47:46,656 --> 00:47:48,282
shorn of secrets,

355
00:47:49,325 --> 00:47:52,662
naked before the eyes of Gods and men…

356
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,041
to make her walk of atonement.

357
00:48:18,354 --> 00:48:20,606
Shame. Shame.

358
00:48:22,066 --> 00:48:22,984
Shame.

359
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:25,945
Shame.

360
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:30,116
Shame. Shame.

361
00:48:32,702 --> 00:48:33,619
Shame.

362
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:37,290
Shame. Shame.

363
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:40,293
Shame.

364
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:44,797
Shame. Shame.

365
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:50,219
Shame. Shame.

366
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:52,680
Shame.

367
00:48:54,223 --> 00:48:55,141
Shame.

368
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:58,603
Shame. Shame.

369
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:03,274
Shame. Shame.

370
00:49:04,734 --> 00:49:05,651
Shame.

371
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:08,404
Shame.

372
00:49:09,155 --> 00:49:10,072
-Cunt!
-Shame.

373
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:11,782
-Sinner!
-Whore!

374
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:13,200
-Shame.
-Whore!

375
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:16,704
-Shame.
-Whore! Whore!

376
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:17,705
Shame.

377
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:21,542
Shame.

378
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:24,211
Shame.

379
00:49:25,338 --> 00:49:26,756
Whore! Sinner!

380
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:29,300
-Shame.
-Bitch! Brother fucker!

381
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:30,676
-Whore!
-Shame.

382
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,805
-Fuck off!
-Shame.

383
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,684
-Shame.
-All hail the royal tits.

384
00:49:38,768 --> 00:49:39,977
-You're a bitch!
-Shame.

385
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:42,021
-Get her!
-Whore!

386
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:43,814
-Bitch!
-Fucker!

387
00:49:44,273 --> 00:49:45,775
-Fucker!
-You bitch!

388
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:47,443
-Cunt!
-Shame.

389
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:50,780
Shame. Shame.

390
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:52,490
-Brother fucker!
-Bitch!

391
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,702
I've had half as many cocks as the queen.

392
00:49:56,786 --> 00:49:59,455
-Bitch!
-Shame.

393
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:01,332
-Shame.
-Sinner! Whore! Slut!

394
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:04,919
Shame.

395
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:09,382
Shame. Shame.

396
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:11,676
-Whore!
-Whore, whore.

397
00:50:13,052 --> 00:50:14,679
I'm a Lannister. Suck me off!

398
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:16,972
-Suck me off, you bitch!
-Back!

399
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:18,641
-Whore!
-Shame.

400
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,685
Shame.

401
00:50:22,311 --> 00:50:25,231
Whore!

402
00:50:25,314 --> 00:50:27,983
Whore! Whore! Whore!

403
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,570
Shame. Shame.

404
00:50:33,072 --> 00:50:34,198
Shame.

405
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:37,535
Shame.

406
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:39,704
Shame.

407
00:50:40,788 --> 00:50:41,872
Shame.

408
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:46,252
-Bitch! Bitch!
-Shame.

409
00:50:53,843 --> 00:50:59,348
-Brother fucker!
-Shame. Shame.

410
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:01,934
Shame.

411
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:04,186
-Whore!
-Brother fucker!

412
00:51:04,687 --> 00:51:06,063
-Whore!
-Shame.

413
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,817
Shame. Shame.

414
00:51:13,696 --> 00:51:15,948
Shame. Shame.

415
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:18,242
Shame.

416
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:21,162
Shame.

417
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:27,126
Shame.

418
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:31,505
-Shame.
-Fucker!

419
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:36,761
Shame. Shame.

420
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:39,263
Shame.

421
00:51:40,765 --> 00:51:43,142
Shame. Shame.

422
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:49,482
Shame. Shame. Shame.

423
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:53,152
Shame. Shame.

424
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:59,742
Shame. Shame. Shame.

425
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:06,040
Shame. Shame. Shame.

426
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:14,089
Shame. Shame.

427
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,010
Shame. Shame.

428
00:52:20,721 --> 00:52:21,639
Shame.

429
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:01,720
Your Grace.

430
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:09,687
It's good to have you back.

431
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:17,695
Come. We'll take you inside.
I need to have a look at those feet.

432
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:27,788
May I have the honor of presenting
the newest member of the Kingsguard?

433
00:53:43,888 --> 00:53:47,182
If it please Your Grace,
he has taken a holy vow of silence.

434
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:52,146
He has sworn that he will not speak
until all His Grace's enemies are dead

435
00:53:52,897 --> 00:53:55,357
and evil has been driven from the realm.

436
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:05,951
Who came to your aid?
Stannis. Now he needs you.

437
00:54:06,035 --> 00:54:07,786
We don't have enough men
to make any difference.

438
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:09,330
The wildlings will make a difference.

439
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:10,915
The wildlings will never fight
for Stannis.

440
00:54:10,998 --> 00:54:13,751
-I told him before.
-You saved their bloody lives.

441
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:16,587
If they're gonna live
in the Seven Kingdoms,

442
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:20,090
safe behind our Wall, they ought
to fight for the damn place.

443
00:54:20,174 --> 00:54:22,301
-It's not their fight.
-Open the gates!

444
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:43,530
Stannis?

445
00:54:50,162 --> 00:54:52,498
Shireen? The princess?

446
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:48,679
Lord Commander.

447
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:50,973
It's one of the wildlings
you brought back.

448
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:53,892
Says he knows your Uncle Benjen.
Says he's still alive.

449
00:55:56,228 --> 00:55:59,565
-Are you sure he's talking about Benjen?
-Said he was First Ranger.

450
00:56:02,109 --> 00:56:03,527
Said he knows where to find him.

451
00:56:10,576 --> 00:56:13,871
Man says he saw your uncle
at Hardhome at the last full moon.

452
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:17,708
-Could be lying.
-Could be. There are ways to find out.

453
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:19,334
-Where is he?
-Over there.

454
00:56:37,186 --> 00:56:38,228
For the Watch.

455
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:44,485
For the Watch.

456
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:48,697
For the Watch.

457
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:52,534
For the Watch.

458
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:55,537
For the Watch.

459
00:57:40,666 --> 00:57:41,667
Olly…

460
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:50,634
For the Watch.
