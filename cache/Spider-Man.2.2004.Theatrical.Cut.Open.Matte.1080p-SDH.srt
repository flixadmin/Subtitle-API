Oh. You were so wonderful.
That was such a great play.

You could've told me
you were coming.

getting married on a hilltop.

You hadn't decided yet.

829

You think just because
you saw my play,

830
01:06:56,930 --> 01:06:59,308
you can talk me out
of getting married?

if you don't get on, Peter.

I don't think it's that simple.
