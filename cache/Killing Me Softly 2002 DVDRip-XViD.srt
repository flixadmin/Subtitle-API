00:01:35,334 --> 00:01:37,632
You know what happens
at that height?

3
00:01:40,005 --> 00:01:43,208
The brain dies
from lack of oxygen...

4
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:44,937
cell by cell.

5
00:01:46,111 --> 00:01:48,046
It just shuts down...

6
00:01:48,046 --> 00:01:49,603
and the body goes with it.

7
00:01:51,551 --> 00:01:54,280
I can't stop thinking about
what it must have been like.

8
00:02:35,891 --> 00:02:38,125
Why don't you start
at the beginning?

9
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:40,116
It's always the easiest.

10
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:44,789
OK, I'll start
at the beginning.

11
00:03:13,425 --> 00:03:15,961
I grew up on the plains
in lndiana.

12
00:03:15,961 --> 00:03:18,554
I was a flatlander,
through and through.

13
00:03:19,632 --> 00:03:20,665
To be honest...

14
00:03:20,665 --> 00:03:22,901
I really didn't have
much to leave behind.

15
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:26,894
Virtually no family
and very few friends.

16
00:03:28,171 --> 00:03:30,909
Anyway, it was January.

17
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:34,645
I'd already been in London
a year and a half.

18
00:03:34,645 --> 00:03:38,014
For the first six months,
I'd been incredibly lonely.

19
00:03:38,014 --> 00:03:39,504
Then I met Jake.

20
00:03:43,486 --> 00:03:45,088
What I loved the most...

21
00:03:45,088 --> 00:03:47,989
was how comfortable
we were with each other.

22
00:03:49,392 --> 00:03:50,826
I felt safe.

23
00:04:07,141 --> 00:04:08,904
OK, let's go.

24
00:04:10,244 --> 00:04:12,378
I design CD-roms
and websites...

25
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:13,582
for corporate clients.

26
00:04:13,582 --> 00:04:15,083
That must pay well.

27
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,418
It sounds fancier
than it is.

28
00:04:17,418 --> 00:04:19,153
Jake was an engineer.

29
00:04:19,153 --> 00:04:22,656
Tunnels and bridges,
that sort of thing.

30
00:04:22,656 --> 00:04:24,058
He kept his tube tickets...

31
00:04:24,058 --> 00:04:26,327
in a wallet he got
when he was twelve.

32
00:04:26,327 --> 00:04:29,495
Same wallet,
same inside pocket.

33
00:04:29,495 --> 00:04:32,157
Alice? Alice?

34
00:04:35,268 --> 00:04:37,395
See you later.

35
00:05:49,337 --> 00:05:50,505
Hey, Alice.

36
00:05:50,505 --> 00:05:51,506
You going in?

37
00:05:51,506 --> 00:05:52,494
Yeah.

38
00:06:17,128 --> 00:06:18,562
I'll see you in a minute.

39
00:06:54,663 --> 00:06:58,200
Reconfigure the training
program manual...

40
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,068
to make it look like
a game on the website.

41
00:07:01,068 --> 00:07:02,763
We tried that with
the appliance kings.

42
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,776
Yes, but this isn't
about washing machines.

43
00:07:07,776 --> 00:07:11,074
Now we're training
a worldwide sales force.

44
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:17,818
You're the new media pioneers.

45
00:07:17,818 --> 00:07:19,453
Think of something.

46
00:07:19,453 --> 00:07:22,114
Alice, you still have
the old template, don't you?

47
00:07:23,124 --> 00:07:25,092
Are you with us, Alice?

48
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,875
I'm going out
to get my hair trimmed.

49
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:43,068
I'll be back after lunch.

50
00:08:05,862 --> 00:08:07,523
Oh, shoot!

51
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,152
And you got in?

52
00:08:30,152 --> 00:08:31,555
Yeah...

53
00:08:31,555 --> 00:08:33,852
I got in.

54
00:09:20,966 --> 00:09:22,868
What's your name?

55
00:09:22,868 --> 00:09:24,129
Alice.

56
00:09:26,437 --> 00:09:28,269
Alice.

57
00:11:38,026 --> 00:11:39,390
Don't turn away.

58
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,434
Come here tomorrow.

59
00:12:00,446 --> 00:12:01,811
I have to work.

60
00:12:07,387 --> 00:12:09,251
Then come back tonight.

61
00:12:10,255 --> 00:12:11,586
I can't.

62
00:12:16,828 --> 00:12:18,464
Whenever you want, Alice.

63
00:12:18,464 --> 00:12:22,695
You decide, and I'll be here.

64
00:12:35,912 --> 00:12:38,380
I couldn't believe
what had happened that day.

65
00:12:39,482 --> 00:12:41,676
I knew it shouldn't
happen again.

66
00:12:43,819 --> 00:12:46,413
I wanted everything
back the way it was.

67
00:12:56,632 --> 00:12:58,691
What do you want me to do?

68
00:13:01,003 --> 00:13:02,833
Nothing, just keep doing
what you're doing.

69
00:13:53,618 --> 00:13:56,020
That was when
I found out his name...

70
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,288
Adam Tallis...

71
00:13:58,288 --> 00:14:00,119
and that he climbed mountains.

72
00:14:07,131 --> 00:14:10,634
He caused quite a stir
here yesterday.

73
00:14:10,634 --> 00:14:13,070
He saved
six people up there...

74
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:15,470
with no oxygen.

75
00:15:09,021 --> 00:15:10,390
You stop me
whenever you want.

76
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,085
Please don't stop.

77
00:15:22,466 --> 00:15:24,057
I bought your book today.

78
00:15:25,602 --> 00:15:27,938
It isn't my book.

79
00:15:27,938 --> 00:15:29,633
I'm just in it.

80
00:15:30,974 --> 00:15:33,067
It looks good.

81
00:15:36,913 --> 00:15:38,778
People died, Alice.

82
00:15:49,326 --> 00:15:50,849
Something went very wrong.

83
00:16:01,903 --> 00:16:04,098
There was a woman
named Francoise Collette.

84
00:16:09,345 --> 00:16:11,244
I lost the whole group.

85
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:18,119
I still don't understand
what happened.

86
00:16:18,119 --> 00:16:20,255
There was no room for error.

87
00:16:20,255 --> 00:16:21,619
Everything had been checked.

88
00:16:26,926 --> 00:16:28,325
I was in love with her.

89
00:16:32,631 --> 00:16:34,792
Do you know what it's like
over 20,000 feet?

90
00:16:44,209 --> 00:16:45,369
It's like this.

91
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:49,472
Without air,
the brain cells die.

92
00:16:51,615 --> 00:16:53,583
It shuts down.

93
00:16:56,254 --> 00:16:58,721
and then the rest
of the body follows.

94
00:17:07,031 --> 00:17:08,399
It's been two years...

95
00:17:08,399 --> 00:17:10,731
and it doesn't go away.

96
00:17:20,976 --> 00:17:22,465
I live with someone.

97
00:17:26,948 --> 00:17:28,244
But you're here.

98
00:17:31,118 --> 00:17:32,450
I have to go.

99
00:17:40,262 --> 00:17:41,695
Don't put them on.

100
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:07,179
Hi. Where are you?

101
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:10,457
I'm running some errands.

102
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:12,092
Do you think you could
pick up my watch...

103
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:13,092
on the way home?

104
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,094
I'm running behind schedule.

105
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,093
I'm never going to make it.

106
00:18:15,093 --> 00:18:16,082
Of course I can.

107
00:18:17,728 --> 00:18:19,897
I missed you today, Alice.

108
00:18:19,897 --> 00:18:21,966
Miss you.

109
00:18:21,966 --> 00:18:22,966
I love you.

110
00:18:22,966 --> 00:18:24,025
Love you.

111
00:18:42,017 --> 00:18:44,178
Knock it! Not nice.

112
00:18:46,623 --> 00:18:47,816
And give it!

113
00:18:49,258 --> 00:18:50,850
Go in!

114
00:19:08,009 --> 00:19:11,274
A card? Ref,
that's a bit harsh.

115
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:18,484
Yeah. Sorry. I'm just...

116
00:19:18,484 --> 00:19:21,146
There's nobody there!

117
00:19:22,155 --> 00:19:23,622
I have to leave you.

118
00:19:24,624 --> 00:19:25,625
You what?

119
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,456
I can't go on like this.
I'm sorry.

120
00:19:28,962 --> 00:19:30,156
I have to leave.

121
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,095
You have to leave me?

122
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:52,410
We're together.

123
00:19:53,918 --> 00:19:55,784
We're perfect together.

124
00:19:58,355 --> 00:20:00,550
I want to marry you.

125
00:20:05,062 --> 00:20:06,291
I met somebody.

126
00:20:17,372 --> 00:20:19,842
Who did you meet?

127
00:20:19,842 --> 00:20:21,103
You don't know him.

128
00:20:22,777 --> 00:20:24,013
I'm sorry.

129
00:20:24,013 --> 00:20:26,215
When did you meet him?

130
00:20:26,215 --> 00:20:27,483
I didn't mean
to hurt you.

131
00:20:27,483 --> 00:20:29,384
It's not the point--

132
00:20:29,384 --> 00:20:31,086
It's very much the point!

133
00:20:31,086 --> 00:20:33,455
We go to the market
together every Sunday!

134
00:20:33,455 --> 00:20:37,291
I buy your fucking
tube tickets for you!

135
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:38,725
Jesus!

136
00:20:47,133 --> 00:20:48,828
Where you going?

137
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,828
You were looking for Adam.

138
00:21:16,828 --> 00:21:19,097
He's not here
at the moment...

139
00:21:19,097 --> 00:21:22,032
but it's cold out there.
Come in.

140
00:21:23,568 --> 00:21:25,536
Please, come in.

141
00:21:33,143 --> 00:21:35,373
I've been climbing in Chile.

142
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,750
Adam always takes
his pictures down...

143
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:43,447
or makes sure his back
is turned to them.

144
00:21:45,355 --> 00:21:47,345
Oh, please, sit down.

145
00:21:49,493 --> 00:21:52,662
For me, pictures
tell me who I am...

146
00:21:52,662 --> 00:21:56,063
but for Adam,
they steal his soul.

147
00:21:59,602 --> 00:22:01,237
Want some?

148
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:02,270
No, thank you.

149
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,294
No, it's quite good.

150
00:22:05,172 --> 00:22:07,741
I'm his sister.

151
00:22:07,741 --> 00:22:09,243
You're his sister?

152
00:22:09,243 --> 00:22:11,444
Yep. I'm Deborah.

153
00:22:11,444 --> 00:22:15,048
We climb together a lot.

154
00:22:15,048 --> 00:22:16,983
He was having some work
done on his place...

155
00:22:16,983 --> 00:22:19,851
so he stayed here
while I was gone.

156
00:22:21,354 --> 00:22:22,356
This...

157
00:22:22,356 --> 00:22:25,519
is Mr. Know-it-all.

158
00:22:29,329 --> 00:22:30,990
It's his name.

159
00:22:35,801 --> 00:22:38,303
This is Francoise, right?

160
00:22:38,303 --> 00:22:39,771
That's the real reason...

161
00:22:39,771 --> 00:22:42,273
my brother takes
the pictures down...

162
00:22:42,273 --> 00:22:43,536
because it's...

163
00:22:44,676 --> 00:22:46,542
too hard for him to see her.

164
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:51,447
My brother's a brave guy,
but sometimes...

165
00:22:53,452 --> 00:22:55,351
he's afraid of remembering.

166
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:01,891
What he forgets...

167
00:23:01,891 --> 00:23:04,427
is that he's not
the only one responsible.

168
00:23:04,427 --> 00:23:06,258
I was up there, too.

169
00:23:08,931 --> 00:23:10,991
She was
my best friend, Alice.

170
00:23:20,009 --> 00:23:23,672
Yes, I know your name.

171
00:23:26,415 --> 00:23:28,781
You're very beautiful.

172
00:23:30,819 --> 00:23:33,412
I can see why he'd
fall so hard for you.

173
00:23:41,094 --> 00:23:42,994
The thing about my brother...

174
00:23:44,098 --> 00:23:46,768
is you're either
with him or you're not.

175
00:23:46,768 --> 00:23:50,871
And once you've made
the jump and you're with him...

176
00:23:50,871 --> 00:23:52,172
that's it...

177
00:23:52,172 --> 00:23:53,662
there's no discussion.

178
00:24:00,278 --> 00:24:01,547
Can I have his address?

179
00:24:01,547 --> 00:24:04,573
Yes, of course.

180
00:24:12,825 --> 00:24:14,486
Thank you.

181
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:28,457
I left him.

182
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:33,494
You're hurting me.

183
00:26:26,981 --> 00:26:28,039
Morning.

184
00:26:30,185 --> 00:26:32,415
Alice, this is Joanna.
Joanna, Alice.

185
00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:39,260
Joanna Noble
from "The Guardian."

186
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,328
I'm interviewing Adam

187
00:26:40,328 --> 00:26:42,096
about his Himalayan
clean-up project.

188
00:26:42,096 --> 00:26:44,291
Nice to meet you.

189
00:26:45,633 --> 00:26:47,623
Where can I find a shirt?

190
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:27,371
Your phone?

191
00:27:27,371 --> 00:27:28,497
Would you get that for me?

192
00:27:36,881 --> 00:27:38,109
No one there.

193
00:27:40,917 --> 00:27:42,419
In some respects,
it's just become...

194
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:45,286
a playground for
the rich and inexperienced.

195
00:27:49,024 --> 00:27:50,013
Thank you.

196
00:27:53,395 --> 00:27:54,595
I have to go to work.

197
00:27:54,595 --> 00:27:56,030
Will you think
about me today?

198
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:58,266
Yes.
What are you doing today?

199
00:27:58,266 --> 00:27:59,255
Thinking about you.

200
00:28:01,436 --> 00:28:03,005
Do you want to learn
how to climb?

201
00:28:03,005 --> 00:28:04,673
Sure.

202
00:28:04,673 --> 00:28:06,334
Come and see me after work.

203
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,089
That's good.

204
00:28:58,089 --> 00:29:00,080
He's not as strong
as he was last week.

205
00:29:09,533 --> 00:29:11,364
It's lovely to see you.

206
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:16,672
I see you've got a harness.

207
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,174
Do you want to put it on?

208
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:21,143
Just put your feet
in there...

209
00:29:21,143 --> 00:29:23,133
and pull it up
like a pair of trousers.

210
00:29:27,483 --> 00:29:28,745
That's great.

211
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:36,691
That's right, double-back in.

212
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:37,826
There we go.

213
00:29:37,826 --> 00:29:38,827
It suits you.

214
00:29:38,827 --> 00:29:39,816
Thank you.

215
00:29:47,401 --> 00:29:49,302
It's OK. I'm helping her.

216
00:29:49,302 --> 00:29:50,570
How are you?

217
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:51,771
OK, fine.

218
00:29:51,771 --> 00:29:54,039
I'm sorry.

219
00:29:54,039 --> 00:29:55,167
Let me check your harness.

220
00:30:00,113 --> 00:30:01,444
Seems to be good.

221
00:30:05,118 --> 00:30:07,352
She's my sister,
but she drives me mad.

222
00:30:07,352 --> 00:30:08,580
I swear it's chemical.

223
00:30:10,089 --> 00:30:11,089
You ready?

224
00:30:11,089 --> 00:30:12,557
I don't know. Maybe.

225
00:30:12,557 --> 00:30:13,751
Come on.

226
00:30:17,395 --> 00:30:20,564
Well, finally, Alice.

227
00:30:20,564 --> 00:30:23,535
The flatlander captured
the mountain boy.

228
00:30:23,535 --> 00:30:26,804
Alice, meet Klaus.
Klaus, Alice.

229
00:30:26,804 --> 00:30:28,135
I liked your book.

230
00:30:29,974 --> 00:30:31,601
Well, thank you.

231
00:30:33,978 --> 00:30:35,411
Well, nice to meet you.

232
00:30:39,581 --> 00:30:42,285
This looks hard.

233
00:30:42,285 --> 00:30:43,683
It's all in the mind.

234
00:31:03,372 --> 00:31:05,373
I mean, my taste in clothes
has completely changed.

235
00:31:05,373 --> 00:31:06,574
Really?

236
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:09,737
I bought this practically
transparent pink T-shirt.

237
00:31:10,912 --> 00:31:12,947
And I won't even tell you
about the lingerie.

238
00:31:12,947 --> 00:31:15,782
No. Probably best not
to mention the lingerie.

239
00:31:15,782 --> 00:31:18,552
I'm still in the big
white cotton panties.

240
00:31:18,552 --> 00:31:20,041
I'm sorry.
I'm a little manic.

241
00:31:24,225 --> 00:31:25,282
Have you seen Jake?

242
00:31:26,726 --> 00:31:27,761
Of course I have.

243
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:29,592
He's been my friend
for 15 years.

244
00:31:31,131 --> 00:31:32,132
How is he?

245
00:31:32,132 --> 00:31:33,132
What can I say?

246
00:31:33,132 --> 00:31:34,401
He's smoking like a fiend...

247
00:31:34,401 --> 00:31:35,491
and he's completely fucked up.

248
00:31:36,768 --> 00:31:38,599
It's not like there's
no reason, is there?

249
00:31:41,339 --> 00:31:42,703
Sorry.

250
00:31:47,479 --> 00:31:50,846
I think that you're
destroying both of your lives.

251
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,683
I'm sorry.

252
00:31:58,021 --> 00:32:00,090
You had somebody
who loved you.

253
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:02,559
You loved each other...

254
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,528
and you let him go
for good sex.

255
00:32:05,528 --> 00:32:08,098
Love isn't just
a good fuck, you know?

256
00:32:08,098 --> 00:32:09,098
This is more.

257
00:32:09,098 --> 00:32:10,533
More what?

258
00:32:10,533 --> 00:32:11,534
More everything.

259
00:32:11,534 --> 00:32:13,803
When I'm with him,
everything is more.

260
00:32:13,803 --> 00:32:14,804
Oh, God, Alice.

261
00:32:14,804 --> 00:32:16,005
You could write
greetings cards.

262
00:32:16,005 --> 00:32:17,439
You really bloody could.

263
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,168
Sorry.

264
00:32:27,884 --> 00:32:29,044
Right.

265
00:32:32,186 --> 00:32:33,621
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

266
00:32:33,621 --> 00:32:35,890
I could do with some retail
therapy myself, I think.

267
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:37,057
I can't,
but come with me.

268
00:32:37,057 --> 00:32:38,526
I'm gonna
see Adam at 3:00.

269
00:32:38,526 --> 00:32:39,514
You can meet him.

270
00:32:45,198 --> 00:32:47,601
And there's this
really amazing store...

271
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:50,069
and I haven't bought it
yet, but I will...

272
00:33:01,247 --> 00:33:02,804
It's OK. She's fine.

273
00:33:36,046 --> 00:33:37,034
Call the police.

274
00:33:39,549 --> 00:33:41,709
Adam! Stop!

275
00:33:55,231 --> 00:33:56,565
When I saw him...

276
00:33:56,565 --> 00:33:58,867
oh, Jesus.

277
00:33:58,867 --> 00:34:00,569
That'll never happen again.

278
00:34:00,569 --> 00:34:01,660
I won't let it.

279
00:34:05,073 --> 00:34:06,441
Are you OK?

280
00:34:06,441 --> 00:34:07,741
Yeah.

281
00:34:07,741 --> 00:34:09,376
I'll always be here, Alice.

282
00:34:09,376 --> 00:34:10,877
Yeah.

283
00:34:10,877 --> 00:34:12,280
I'll protect you.

284
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,281
Say you believe me.

285
00:34:13,281 --> 00:34:14,441
I believe you.

286
00:34:21,256 --> 00:34:22,313
Marry me.

287
00:34:28,393 --> 00:34:30,362
The sooner the better.

288
00:34:30,362 --> 00:34:32,565
Tomorrow.

289
00:34:32,565 --> 00:34:34,432
The day after,
as soon as possible.

290
00:34:34,432 --> 00:34:36,525
-Marry me!
-Yes!

291
00:34:50,148 --> 00:34:53,014
Sir, can we ask you
some questions, please?

292
00:35:18,375 --> 00:35:20,076
"Use your head, Alice.

293
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,203
"What do you really know
about him?"

294
00:35:29,317 --> 00:35:30,451
Hey, you ready?

295
00:35:30,451 --> 00:35:31,679
Look at this.

296
00:35:34,954 --> 00:35:37,290
Someone's trying to scare you.

297
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:38,292
There's been
a call this morning.

298
00:35:38,292 --> 00:35:39,294
There was someone there...

299
00:35:39,294 --> 00:35:40,453
but they didn't say anything.

300
00:35:42,129 --> 00:35:43,197
Makes me sick.

301
00:35:43,197 --> 00:35:46,466
If anything else
happens like this again...

302
00:35:46,466 --> 00:35:49,061
make sure you tell me, OK?

303
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,300
You'll be fine.

304
00:36:22,532 --> 00:36:23,867
Do you, Alice...

305
00:36:23,867 --> 00:36:25,569
promise to love
and cherish Adam...

306
00:36:25,569 --> 00:36:27,604
for as long
as you both shall live?

307
00:36:27,604 --> 00:36:29,339
I do.

308
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:33,143
And do you, Adam, promise
to love and cherish Alice...

309
00:36:33,143 --> 00:36:35,479
for as long
as you both shall live?

310
00:36:35,479 --> 00:36:36,947
I do.

311
00:36:36,947 --> 00:36:39,149
May the Lord
bless this union...

312
00:36:39,149 --> 00:36:41,810
and secure it from all harm.

313
00:37:04,372 --> 00:37:06,241
How do you know the priest?

314
00:37:06,241 --> 00:37:08,977
This is my family church.

315
00:37:08,977 --> 00:37:11,346
You have a family church?

316
00:37:11,346 --> 00:37:13,148
Wow, I have a mother
who doesn't talk to me...

317
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:14,479
and a dad I've never met.

318
00:37:15,649 --> 00:37:16,851
It doesn't matter.

319
00:37:16,851 --> 00:37:19,613
My life began
when we first saw each other.

320
00:37:22,655 --> 00:37:24,791
Come on.
I need you to see something.

321
00:37:24,791 --> 00:37:25,779
What?

322
00:37:42,174 --> 00:37:43,675
No, no, no,
wait, wait, wait.

323
00:37:43,675 --> 00:37:45,076
Now, I want you
to see this...

324
00:37:45,076 --> 00:37:47,135
through my eyes
when I was six.

325
00:37:48,179 --> 00:37:50,044
Look. Like this.

326
00:37:57,188 --> 00:38:00,088
You know the story that
we're broken into two pieces?

327
00:38:01,959 --> 00:38:03,427
And we spend our lives

328
00:38:03,427 --> 00:38:05,224
searching for
our other half.

329
00:38:08,799 --> 00:38:10,130
You're it.

330
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,864
OK, here we are.

331
00:38:21,643 --> 00:38:23,008
We're getting dressed here?

332
00:38:25,379 --> 00:38:27,244
Yep. Here.

333
00:38:48,268 --> 00:38:50,804
No! No, no, no, no.
Don't do that.

334
00:38:50,804 --> 00:38:52,533
I need to remember you
like this.

335
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,222
Come on. I don't want you
to freeze to death.

336
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:11,950
Come on.

337
00:39:45,421 --> 00:39:46,555
This is the only
way station...

338
00:39:46,555 --> 00:39:47,887
for hikers
in the whole area.

339
00:39:49,425 --> 00:39:51,949
The church has kept supplies
up here for years.

340
00:40:00,369 --> 00:40:03,305
You went hiking
on your wedding day?

341
00:40:03,305 --> 00:40:05,296
That's his idea of romance.

342
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:13,146
I thought a honeymoon
was lying in bed...

343
00:40:13,146 --> 00:40:14,280
with room service.

344
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:17,517
Oh, I'll give you
a honeymoon you won't forget.

345
00:40:17,517 --> 00:40:19,519
I promise.

346
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:20,507
No, no, sit down.

347
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:26,252
Choose your rhythm and then
commit to following it.

348
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,793
Count if you have to.

349
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:37,565
I'm gonna make you strong!

350
00:40:46,278 --> 00:40:49,013
I wanted him to be
proud of me...

351
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:51,243
so I followed the trail
for hours.

352
00:41:42,429 --> 00:41:43,657
You made it.

353
00:41:54,342 --> 00:41:55,342
What's that?

354
00:41:55,342 --> 00:41:56,543
It's an anchor...

355
00:41:56,543 --> 00:41:58,670
to catch a falling body.

356
00:42:01,881 --> 00:42:02,869
Catch.

357
00:42:06,284 --> 00:42:09,120
Do you trust me?

358
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,144
Yes.

359
00:42:18,797 --> 00:42:20,196
Don't move.

360
00:42:55,163 --> 00:42:57,800
I gave up all control.

361
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,468
I let him decide
when I could breathe...

362
00:43:00,468 --> 00:43:03,270
and when I couldn't.

363
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:05,170
I loved it.

364
00:43:59,022 --> 00:44:01,013
God, I love you!

365
00:44:12,469 --> 00:44:14,203
We returned to London...

366
00:44:14,203 --> 00:44:16,194
and Joanna Noble's
article came out.

367
00:44:18,073 --> 00:44:19,506
I was happier
than I'd ever been.

368
00:44:22,812 --> 00:44:23,801
Excuse me.

369
00:44:25,647 --> 00:44:26,910
-There you go.
-Thanks.

370
00:45:13,859 --> 00:45:15,019
Hello, Jake?

371
00:45:16,026 --> 00:45:19,296
No, it's Sylvie speaking.
Hello, Alice.

372
00:45:19,296 --> 00:45:20,565
Sylvie?

373
00:45:20,565 --> 00:45:21,565
I must have dialed wrong.

374
00:45:21,565 --> 00:45:22,566
I thought I was
calling Jake.

375
00:45:22,566 --> 00:45:23,869
Oh, no, no, that's fine.

376
00:45:23,869 --> 00:45:26,503
I just happened to be
over, actually.

377
00:45:26,503 --> 00:45:29,540
Jake's going to be
back soon, I think.

378
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:32,475
Look, Alice, this is
gonna sound a bit weird...

379
00:45:32,475 --> 00:45:34,143
but I was definitely
going to tell you...

380
00:45:34,143 --> 00:45:37,481
but Jake and l
have actually been...

381
00:45:37,481 --> 00:45:39,016
seeing each other.

382
00:45:39,016 --> 00:45:40,346
You and Jake?

383
00:45:41,851 --> 00:45:44,719
Well, it...
just sort of happened.

384
00:45:47,223 --> 00:45:48,212
Did you move in?

385
00:45:50,192 --> 00:45:53,661
Yeah. Yeah, I did,
uh, sort of.

386
00:45:53,661 --> 00:45:55,561
Oh, Lord.

387
00:45:56,631 --> 00:45:58,766
How cliche is this?

388
00:45:58,766 --> 00:46:00,534
Old friend moves in...

389
00:46:00,534 --> 00:46:02,169
to console jilted boyfriend...

390
00:46:02,169 --> 00:46:04,467
and then these two find
themselves together.

391
00:46:07,041 --> 00:46:09,010
You gonna be OK with this?

392
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:10,944
Yeah, I'm OK.

393
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,577
We're gonna be late!
Hurry up!

394
00:46:17,151 --> 00:46:18,718
Yeah, I gotta go.

395
00:46:18,718 --> 00:46:19,946
We'll talk
about it later, OK?

396
00:46:40,806 --> 00:46:41,796
Here we go.

397
00:46:48,445 --> 00:46:50,504
How you doing?!

398
00:46:51,882 --> 00:46:53,406
Hey, Alice, Alice,
I'm sorry.

399
00:47:05,562 --> 00:47:07,197
Sorry.

400
00:47:07,197 --> 00:47:08,288
Excuse me.

401
00:47:13,602 --> 00:47:16,127
How you doing?
It's really nice to see you.

402
00:48:10,789 --> 00:48:12,780
It's Alice Tallis.

403
00:48:14,759 --> 00:48:16,693
My rhyming sister-in-law.

404
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,131
Are you OK?

405
00:48:20,131 --> 00:48:21,966
I have a headache and was
looking for some aspirin.

406
00:48:21,966 --> 00:48:23,524
Oh, no, give me your hand.

407
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:32,743
Can you feel that?

408
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,233
Yeah, it really hurts.

409
00:48:35,513 --> 00:48:36,502
Close your eyes.

410
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:39,806
Breathe.

411
00:48:41,117 --> 00:48:42,277
Slowly.

412
00:48:56,097 --> 00:48:57,395
That's good.

413
00:48:59,568 --> 00:49:02,270
It's the meridian
that controls the kidney

414
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:04,738
or the brain
or the left big toe.

415
00:49:05,740 --> 00:49:07,571
I forget which.

416
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:12,771
But...it's whatever
works, right?

417
00:49:14,415 --> 00:49:16,017
Thank you.

418
00:49:16,017 --> 00:49:18,143
Close your eyes.

419
00:49:25,191 --> 00:49:27,260
OK, you can open them.

420
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:29,490
Oh, my God.

421
00:49:30,763 --> 00:49:33,032
I want to drink to that
beautiful lady in blue.

422
00:49:33,032 --> 00:49:34,090
Where is she?

423
00:49:40,939 --> 00:49:43,499
I don't think she's ever
climbed past the third floor...

424
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:47,100
but she has conquered
our Adam.

425
00:49:48,345 --> 00:49:51,615
But what she doesn't know
is that to get Adam...

426
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:53,483
she also gets us.

427
00:49:53,483 --> 00:49:55,384
Hear, hear!

428
00:50:05,996 --> 00:50:08,297
Most of the people
using the program are women...

429
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:09,566
and we try
to sell them a game...

430
00:50:09,566 --> 00:50:11,567
but women don't like games.

431
00:50:11,567 --> 00:50:12,568
Women like stories.

432
00:50:12,568 --> 00:50:13,736
Men like games.

433
00:50:13,736 --> 00:50:15,471
Men like to slay the dragon...

434
00:50:15,471 --> 00:50:16,571
and get the princess...

435
00:50:16,571 --> 00:50:17,773
but women like to know...

436
00:50:17,773 --> 00:50:19,208
how did the dragon
and the princess...

437
00:50:19,208 --> 00:50:21,005
all get there
in the first place.

438
00:50:22,812 --> 00:50:24,278
A game is
the wrong approach.

439
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,611
Sorry.

440
00:50:34,589 --> 00:50:35,991
Excuse me.

441
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:37,323
Alice Tallis.

442
00:50:37,323 --> 00:50:38,792
This is Joanna Noble.

443
00:50:38,792 --> 00:50:39,793
Do you remember me?

444
00:50:39,793 --> 00:50:41,594
Yes, I remember you.

445
00:50:41,594 --> 00:50:46,032
I got a weird note
about the article.

446
00:50:46,032 --> 00:50:48,034
I'm not gonna do
anything with it.

447
00:50:48,034 --> 00:50:50,369
I mean, I'm certainly not
going to follow it up.

448
00:50:50,369 --> 00:50:52,472
It's probably
stupid of me...

449
00:50:52,472 --> 00:50:54,307
but I somehow felt obliged...

450
00:50:54,307 --> 00:50:55,672
to tell you about it.

451
00:50:57,143 --> 00:50:58,878
Shall I send it to you?

452
00:50:58,878 --> 00:51:01,780
Yeah, you can send it.

453
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:03,949
Is it private?

454
00:51:03,949 --> 00:51:06,285
I don't want this sitting
in a public "in" basket.

455
00:51:06,285 --> 00:51:08,387
I understand.
You can fax it.

456
00:51:08,387 --> 00:51:09,854
OK, I'll do that.

457
00:51:09,854 --> 00:51:10,856
You have the number?

458
00:51:10,856 --> 00:51:11,856
Yeah, I got it
from your secretary.

459
00:51:11,856 --> 00:51:13,457
OK, thanks for calling.

460
00:51:13,457 --> 00:51:14,822
Sorry.
I had to take that.

461
00:51:17,028 --> 00:51:18,629
No problem.

462
00:51:18,629 --> 00:51:20,132
Gave me a chance to think.

463
00:51:20,132 --> 00:51:22,267
We shouldn't be playing games.

464
00:51:22,267 --> 00:51:24,928
It's obvious
women don't like games.

465
00:51:28,806 --> 00:51:31,242
I think this project
needs a new face.

466
00:51:31,242 --> 00:51:34,176
"Dear Joanna Noble,
what you wrote made me sick.

467
00:51:34,176 --> 00:51:36,980
"Your big hero Adam Tallis
raped me.

468
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:39,447
"Why don't you try
reporting the truth?"

469
00:51:42,283 --> 00:51:44,410
It's out of paper.

470
00:51:47,989 --> 00:51:50,659
I've decided
that from now on...

471
00:51:50,659 --> 00:51:53,262
this is Alice's project.

472
00:51:53,262 --> 00:51:55,263
You're the new point man...

473
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:57,165
I mean, point girl...

474
00:51:57,165 --> 00:51:58,234
woman.

475
00:51:58,234 --> 00:51:59,222
Excellent.

476
00:52:05,873 --> 00:52:07,274
Congratulations, Alice.

477
00:52:07,274 --> 00:52:08,502
Thank you.

478
00:52:12,846 --> 00:52:14,481
Open or closed?

479
00:52:14,481 --> 00:52:15,971
Closed.

480
00:52:26,994 --> 00:52:28,255
Fuck!

481
00:52:36,835 --> 00:52:38,737
Alice Tallis' office.

482
00:52:38,737 --> 00:52:41,005
Hello, Claudia,
it's Adam.

483
00:52:41,005 --> 00:52:42,406
Oh, hi, Adam.

484
00:52:42,406 --> 00:52:43,440
Hi. Is Alice there?

485
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,242
No, she's just left,
actually.

486
00:52:45,242 --> 00:52:46,444
Left? Where'd she go?

487
00:52:46,444 --> 00:52:48,571
I think she went
to the doctor's.

488
00:52:59,857 --> 00:53:03,459
So, you thought this woman
was sending the notes?

489
00:53:03,459 --> 00:53:04,484
Yes.

490
00:53:24,013 --> 00:53:25,213
Yeah?

491
00:53:25,213 --> 00:53:28,116
Hello, I'm Joanna Noble
from "The Guardian."

492
00:53:28,116 --> 00:53:29,284
I called you before.

493
00:53:29,284 --> 00:53:30,451
Yeah.

494
00:53:30,451 --> 00:53:32,316
-Are you Michelle Stowe?
-Yeah, I am. Come in.

495
00:53:34,021 --> 00:53:35,851
It was at a birthday party.

496
00:53:38,091 --> 00:53:40,160
I asked him to dance...

497
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:42,721
and then, I don't know...

498
00:53:44,532 --> 00:53:46,591
we start kissin'.

499
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:50,125
I mean, I was shit-faced.

500
00:53:51,871 --> 00:53:53,895
I came and put my hand
in his shirt...

501
00:53:54,908 --> 00:53:56,808
then we went outside.

502
00:54:03,015 --> 00:54:05,540
Guess at the end, I was just
straightening up a bit...

503
00:54:06,884 --> 00:54:08,442
'cause I remember wondering...

504
00:54:11,657 --> 00:54:13,023
what the hell I was doing.

505
00:54:24,035 --> 00:54:26,297
Then he pulled me
into the bushes...

506
00:54:27,404 --> 00:54:28,701
undid my dress.

507
00:54:30,807 --> 00:54:32,104
It was a zip...

508
00:54:33,242 --> 00:54:34,231
in the back.

509
00:54:40,983 --> 00:54:42,780
I was so young.

510
00:54:50,192 --> 00:54:51,955
I started to cry.

511
00:54:53,429 --> 00:54:55,453
He put his hand
over my mouth and kept going.

512
00:54:59,167 --> 00:55:00,401
He's strong.

513
00:55:00,401 --> 00:55:02,392
There was nothing
I could do.

514
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:06,100
I tried to fight him.

515
00:55:12,147 --> 00:55:14,149
When he was done,
he shook me...

516
00:55:14,149 --> 00:55:15,878
and said something like...

517
00:55:16,984 --> 00:55:19,654
"It's only sex.

518
00:55:19,654 --> 00:55:21,644
"Just sex."

519
00:55:22,889 --> 00:55:23,990
Then he got up...

520
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:27,152
and left the party
with his sister.

521
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:40,704
So, you want to write
an article about this, then?

522
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:44,509
I mean, he's not royal
or anything...

523
00:55:44,509 --> 00:55:46,100
but it's close enough.

524
00:55:47,378 --> 00:55:49,676
We can make some money
out of this, Joanna.

525
00:55:56,787 --> 00:55:58,155
It doesn't work that way.

526
00:55:58,155 --> 00:56:00,224
Yeah, it does.
Everybody's always blabbin'...

527
00:56:00,224 --> 00:56:01,859
about who's stickin' it
into who.

528
00:56:01,859 --> 00:56:03,553
They make plenty.

529
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:06,464
You have no proof.

530
00:56:06,464 --> 00:56:09,797
This is a question of
"he said, she said."

531
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:14,270
Jesus, Alice, I can't
believe you did this.

532
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:16,738
What if she calls
my editor?

533
00:56:16,738 --> 00:56:17,841
I could be fired.

534
00:56:17,841 --> 00:56:19,442
Do you think
that nosy wives...

535
00:56:19,442 --> 00:56:21,310
have immunity
from normal behavior?

536
00:56:21,310 --> 00:56:22,778
I knew the minute
that I called...

537
00:56:22,778 --> 00:56:23,878
that it was a mistake.

538
00:56:23,878 --> 00:56:25,379
Sorry, Alice.

539
00:56:25,379 --> 00:56:27,381
It's OK. I just--

540
00:56:27,381 --> 00:56:28,583
I thought you should know
what I did.

541
00:56:28,583 --> 00:56:30,351
It was really
just innocent curiosity.

542
00:56:30,351 --> 00:56:32,320
It's never innocent.

543
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:35,958
Curiosity gets people killed.

544
00:56:35,958 --> 00:56:37,558
What would you do
if it was your husband?

545
00:56:37,558 --> 00:56:39,627
I don't have one.

546
00:56:39,627 --> 00:56:41,194
You not only have one...

547
00:56:41,194 --> 00:56:42,525
but one who's wild
about you.

548
00:56:45,765 --> 00:56:47,892
You're right.
I have to trust him.

549
00:57:14,793 --> 00:57:16,860
People have stories.

550
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:19,530
You and l, everyone.

551
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:22,399
But I couldn't tell you
one complete story...

552
00:57:22,399 --> 00:57:24,201
about my husband.

553
00:57:24,201 --> 00:57:26,536
Practically everything
I knew about him...

554
00:57:26,536 --> 00:57:29,672
came from a book
or a newspaper...

555
00:57:29,672 --> 00:57:33,377
or shreds of information
dropped by other people.

556
00:57:33,377 --> 00:57:35,646
I couldn't help myself.

557
00:57:35,646 --> 00:57:38,011
I needed to know more.

558
00:58:07,309 --> 00:58:09,003
"Adele Blanchard."

559
00:58:15,081 --> 00:58:16,282
"It's crazy...

560
00:58:16,282 --> 00:58:18,648
"but I want to show
the world my bruises."

561
00:58:20,753 --> 00:58:23,188
"What we're doing
is dangerous...

562
00:58:23,188 --> 00:58:25,816
"but I still can't help
wanting more."

563
00:58:33,565 --> 00:58:36,435
"The only way to end this
is to be brutal.

564
00:58:36,435 --> 00:58:39,738
"We have to stop
what we're doing.

565
00:58:39,738 --> 00:58:43,207
"I've decided to go back
to my husband.

566
00:58:43,207 --> 00:58:46,978
"I'm not strong enough to live
on the edge with you anymore.

567
00:58:46,978 --> 00:58:49,280
"l know you won't fall,
but I will.

568
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,482
"I'm sure of it.

569
00:58:51,482 --> 00:58:53,818
"This tears me apart...

570
00:58:53,818 --> 00:58:56,586
"But I have to go back
to Michael.

571
00:58:56,586 --> 00:58:58,724
"l love you.

572
00:58:58,724 --> 00:58:59,815
"Adele."

573
01:00:06,118 --> 01:00:07,881
I've been thinking about you.

574
01:00:14,859 --> 01:00:16,416
Me, too.

575
01:00:36,979 --> 01:00:39,949
I called the office yesterday
looking for you.

576
01:00:39,949 --> 01:00:41,484
Oh, yeah?

577
01:00:41,484 --> 01:00:42,884
Claudia said
you weren't feeling well.

578
01:00:42,884 --> 01:00:44,749
She thought you might be
at the doctor's.

579
01:00:46,955 --> 01:00:48,290
I, um...

580
01:00:48,290 --> 01:00:50,492
I had an appointment,
but, um...

581
01:00:50,492 --> 01:00:51,858
I never got out
of my meeting.

582
01:01:06,139 --> 01:01:08,142
Where was the meeting?

583
01:01:08,142 --> 01:01:10,235
At the, um, client's hotel.

584
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:18,684
Which hotel?

585
01:01:18,684 --> 01:01:19,983
The Hilton.

586
01:01:25,325 --> 01:01:26,586
I'm sorry for being nosy.

587
01:01:27,761 --> 01:01:31,322
I just like to picture
what you do during the day.

588
01:01:58,022 --> 01:02:00,047
Where'd you get this?

589
01:02:01,291 --> 01:02:02,621
Deborah gave it to me.

590
01:02:09,198 --> 01:02:10,687
She has good taste.

591
01:02:20,743 --> 01:02:22,344
I got a call about, um...

592
01:02:22,344 --> 01:02:24,574
a weird call
about the article.

593
01:02:25,814 --> 01:02:28,683
There was this woman
named Michelle Stowe.

594
01:02:28,683 --> 01:02:30,241
She sent a fax.

595
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:34,522
Didn't happen, Alice.

596
01:02:34,522 --> 01:02:35,545
I never raped her.

597
01:02:36,757 --> 01:02:38,691
I shouldn't have...

598
01:02:40,294 --> 01:02:42,763
I've known her
since we were kids.

599
01:02:42,763 --> 01:02:45,858
I think she saw me
as a way out.

600
01:02:47,368 --> 01:02:50,103
If you met her,
you'd understand.

601
01:02:50,103 --> 01:02:52,230
I'm not surprised
she contacted you.

602
01:02:55,975 --> 01:02:57,966
I'm just sorry
you had to hear all that.

603
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:10,721
Good morning.

604
01:03:10,721 --> 01:03:11,722
Hi there.
Are you ready?

605
01:03:11,722 --> 01:03:13,622
I'll just get my jacket.

606
01:03:19,831 --> 01:03:21,466
I'm sorry to barge in
like that...

607
01:03:21,466 --> 01:03:23,268
but your husband refuses
to understand the fact...

608
01:03:23,268 --> 01:03:25,101
that sponsors need talk shows...

609
01:03:25,101 --> 01:03:28,230
and he would only show up
if I drove.

610
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:34,811
Why didn't you tell me...

611
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:36,478
you were gonna be
on a talk show?

612
01:03:36,478 --> 01:03:38,275
It's just
a stupid jazz show.

613
01:05:41,662 --> 01:05:43,364
Directory inquiries.

614
01:05:43,364 --> 01:05:45,899
Yes. Adele Blanchard.

615
01:05:45,899 --> 01:05:47,167
Which city, please?

616
01:05:47,167 --> 01:05:48,235
It's London.

617
01:05:48,235 --> 01:05:49,970
Do you have a listing
for Adele Blanchard...

618
01:05:49,970 --> 01:05:51,536
on Marchmont Road?

619
01:05:51,536 --> 01:05:52,526
One moment.

620
01:06:05,485 --> 01:06:07,919
This train is about to depart.

621
01:06:07,919 --> 01:06:09,750
Please mind the doors.

622
01:06:37,247 --> 01:06:39,044
I'm looking
for Adele Blanchard.

623
01:06:40,450 --> 01:06:41,885
I'm her mother.

624
01:06:41,885 --> 01:06:43,250
Is she home?

625
01:06:46,555 --> 01:06:48,489
You must be one
of her American friends.

626
01:06:48,489 --> 01:06:50,981
We tried to contact everyone.

627
01:06:55,730 --> 01:06:57,856
She's been missing
for eight months.

628
01:06:59,366 --> 01:07:00,802
Missing?

629
01:07:00,802 --> 01:07:02,293
What did you say
your name was?

630
01:07:04,572 --> 01:07:06,107
Joanna.

631
01:07:06,107 --> 01:07:09,142
She never tried
to contact her husband?

632
01:07:09,142 --> 01:07:10,545
Not even a letter
to an old boyfriend...

633
01:07:10,545 --> 01:07:11,946
or something?

634
01:07:11,946 --> 01:07:14,815
Eight months
and not a word.

635
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:17,584
And this is from a daughter...

636
01:07:17,584 --> 01:07:20,746
who manages to e-mail
her mother from Nepal.

637
01:07:26,826 --> 01:07:30,831
Joanna, promise me you'll never
think the worst about Adele.

638
01:07:30,831 --> 01:07:33,365
It helps a little...

639
01:07:33,365 --> 01:07:35,697
if one tries to be positive.

640
01:07:44,543 --> 01:07:48,378
She was so happy that day.

641
01:07:48,378 --> 01:07:50,278
No jitters, nothing.

642
01:07:54,251 --> 01:07:55,582
Do you know him?

643
01:07:57,421 --> 01:07:59,188
Adam Tallis.

644
01:07:59,188 --> 01:08:02,493
She climbed all over
the world with him.

645
01:08:02,493 --> 01:08:04,827
My son-in-law Michael...

646
01:08:04,827 --> 01:08:06,795
is a trader in Milan.

647
01:08:08,131 --> 01:08:10,800
At first, he never
stood in her way...

648
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,028
when it came to climbing.

649
01:08:13,536 --> 01:08:16,238
Then after two years,
he got fed up.

650
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:19,808
It was either climbing
or the marriage.

651
01:08:19,808 --> 01:08:21,435
She chose the marriage.

652
01:08:23,878 --> 01:08:26,938
The day before she was
supposed to go back to Milan...

653
01:08:29,050 --> 01:08:30,652
she went out...

654
01:08:30,652 --> 01:08:32,711
and never came back.

655
01:08:35,222 --> 01:08:38,359
I found that
in her bags.

656
01:08:38,359 --> 01:08:41,227
It's probably the last
picture taken of her.

657
01:08:44,230 --> 01:08:49,002
Today I've had two signs
that Adele is close by.

658
01:08:49,002 --> 01:08:51,061
You arrived,
and Adam called.

659
01:08:58,678 --> 01:09:01,480
He wanted to know
if there was anything new...

660
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:03,141
in the investigation.

661
01:09:05,484 --> 01:09:06,752
Would you like
to stay for dinner?

662
01:09:06,752 --> 01:09:08,954
No, thank you.
I just--I have to get home.

663
01:09:08,954 --> 01:09:10,546
It's really late.

664
01:09:12,924 --> 01:09:14,125
I'm disappointed.

665
01:09:14,125 --> 01:09:16,992
He should be here around 5:00.

666
01:09:20,298 --> 01:09:22,322
You and Adam
would love each other.

667
01:09:24,601 --> 01:09:26,337
Sit, sit.

668
01:09:26,337 --> 01:09:28,066
I'll get it.

669
01:09:39,848 --> 01:09:42,184
Is it all right if
I set it up for next week?

670
01:09:42,184 --> 01:09:43,751
I haven't managed
to get to the bank yet.

671
01:09:43,751 --> 01:09:46,155
Yes, of course.

672
01:09:46,155 --> 01:09:48,523
Mrs. Blanchard.

673
01:09:48,523 --> 01:09:50,558
I'm sorry, I just--
I have to get back.

674
01:09:50,558 --> 01:09:51,926
I don't want
to be late.

675
01:09:51,926 --> 01:09:53,093
I was hoping
you would stay a little.

676
01:09:53,093 --> 01:09:54,618
I'm sorry.

677
01:10:12,713 --> 01:10:15,148
This train is about to depart.

678
01:10:15,148 --> 01:10:17,139
Please mind the doors.

679
01:13:47,378 --> 01:13:49,113
What are you doing?!

680
01:13:49,113 --> 01:13:51,445
What am I doing?
I'm making you mine.

681
01:13:59,390 --> 01:14:02,125
Sometimes I feel
like I don't know you.

682
01:14:02,125 --> 01:14:03,717
Oh, you know me.

683
01:14:05,929 --> 01:14:07,987
You know everything
you need to know.

684
01:14:10,768 --> 01:14:11,756
Look at me.

685
01:14:15,271 --> 01:14:17,102
Open your eyes.

686
01:14:18,575 --> 01:14:20,143
Please.

687
01:14:20,143 --> 01:14:22,610
Open your eyes!

688
01:14:35,055 --> 01:14:36,716
You've been with another man.

689
01:14:39,494 --> 01:14:41,329
No.

690
01:14:41,329 --> 01:14:43,964
What are you doing, then?

691
01:14:43,964 --> 01:14:45,761
What's going on in there?

692
01:14:47,467 --> 01:14:49,836
Why do you keep sneaking around?

693
01:14:49,836 --> 01:14:51,837
Is the suspicion exciting?

694
01:14:51,837 --> 01:14:53,737
Do you need it go get off?
What is it?

695
01:14:56,075 --> 01:14:57,736
I found Adele's letters.

696
01:15:01,280 --> 01:15:03,348
You...

697
01:15:03,348 --> 01:15:05,283
found...

698
01:15:05,283 --> 01:15:06,875
her letters?

699
01:15:09,355 --> 01:15:11,117
Is that how
you tell the story?

700
01:15:12,258 --> 01:15:13,692
What, they were just...

701
01:15:13,692 --> 01:15:15,361
sitting with my keys
on the table...

702
01:15:15,361 --> 01:15:16,918
and you just happened
to notice them?

703
01:15:32,173 --> 01:15:34,075
Look what I just
happened to find!

704
01:15:34,075 --> 01:15:36,713
These and these!

705
01:15:36,713 --> 01:15:38,080
And I found these!
Here, read them!

706
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:40,446
I have nothing to hide, Alice!

707
01:15:59,867 --> 01:16:02,529
Did you sneak around
behind my back because you...

708
01:16:04,405 --> 01:16:06,373
need it to get
rougher and rougher?

709
01:16:06,373 --> 01:16:08,204
I mean, is that it?

710
01:16:09,277 --> 01:16:10,946
I'm trying
to understand you, Alice.

711
01:16:10,946 --> 01:16:13,573
If you do this,
will I punish you?

712
01:16:15,182 --> 01:16:16,979
Is that what your goal...

713
01:16:27,259 --> 01:16:29,427
Please untie me.

714
01:16:29,427 --> 01:16:31,555
If you trusted me...

715
01:16:33,364 --> 01:16:35,799
you wouldn't be
in this position, Alice.

716
01:16:40,805 --> 01:16:42,640
I just...

717
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,709
I wanted to know more...

718
01:16:44,709 --> 01:16:46,410
about you.

719
01:16:46,410 --> 01:16:48,713
And I wanted
to know your past...

720
01:16:48,713 --> 01:16:51,147
and I wanted to know
your stories.

721
01:16:52,717 --> 01:16:55,118
I just thought
if I knew more...

722
01:16:55,118 --> 01:16:57,916
that I could love you more.

723
01:17:01,324 --> 01:17:04,261
I know the only thing
that matters is us together.

724
01:17:04,261 --> 01:17:05,830
I know that.

725
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:08,098
Because when
you're not around...

726
01:17:08,098 --> 01:17:10,200
I get lost.

727
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:13,191
It drives me crazy
to think about losing you.

728
01:17:20,675 --> 01:17:22,438
I'm yours, Alice.

729
01:17:25,279 --> 01:17:27,076
What more do you need to know?

730
01:17:36,123 --> 01:17:39,615
I could break your neck,
I love you so much.

731
01:17:44,865 --> 01:17:47,066
Do you want to stay here?

732
01:17:47,066 --> 01:17:48,329
I mean...

733
01:17:50,469 --> 01:17:52,164
do you like this?

734
01:17:55,408 --> 01:17:58,172
Adam, I have to pee.

735
01:18:44,887 --> 01:18:46,080
My God.

736
01:18:54,763 --> 01:18:57,357
Alice, please,
don't do this! Alice!

737
01:19:01,169 --> 01:19:02,659
Please!

738
01:19:03,805 --> 01:19:06,137
Where are you going?!

739
01:19:07,676 --> 01:19:09,210
Alice, please!

740
01:19:09,210 --> 01:19:11,234
What are you doing?!

741
01:20:38,859 --> 01:20:41,657
And that's when
I came to you.

742
01:20:59,579 --> 01:21:01,414
I want to be clear
with you.

743
01:21:01,414 --> 01:21:03,715
In my experience,
charges of domestic violence...

744
01:21:03,715 --> 01:21:05,249
are usually too little
too late.

745
01:21:05,249 --> 01:21:07,718
I want you to reopen
the Adele Blanchard case.

746
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:12,122
It's not easy
to reopen a case like this.

747
01:21:12,122 --> 01:21:13,958
Britain is swimming
in missing persons.

748
01:21:13,958 --> 01:21:15,091
He killed her.

749
01:21:15,091 --> 01:21:17,094
Mrs. Tallis, any case...

750
01:21:17,094 --> 01:21:21,066
missing person or murder,
needs evidence.

751
01:21:21,066 --> 01:21:22,733
I have to ask you
what you have.

752
01:21:22,733 --> 01:21:25,099
Adele's letters?

753
01:21:26,236 --> 01:21:27,238
No.

754
01:21:27,238 --> 01:21:28,873
Warning notes?

755
01:21:28,873 --> 01:21:31,307
No.

756
01:21:31,307 --> 01:21:33,176
You have...

757
01:21:33,176 --> 01:21:34,575
two photos.

758
01:21:35,678 --> 01:21:39,248
Proof of nothing.

759
01:21:39,248 --> 01:21:40,883
He raped Michelle.

760
01:21:40,883 --> 01:21:42,475
She never reported it.

761
01:21:55,631 --> 01:21:57,622
Start without me.
I'll be there in a bit.

762
01:22:03,237 --> 01:22:05,500
I'd like to help you,
Mrs. Tallis.

763
01:22:06,973 --> 01:22:09,806
What everyone else
does to be like him.

764
01:22:11,211 --> 01:22:12,812
He can't see you.

765
01:22:12,812 --> 01:22:15,214
She's pretty shaken up.

766
01:22:15,214 --> 01:22:17,384
Is she? I mean,
is she hurt?

767
01:22:17,384 --> 01:22:19,352
She--Jesus, she was
running into traffic.

768
01:22:19,352 --> 01:22:20,854
Let's get a doctor.

769
01:22:20,854 --> 01:22:23,219
She'll be fine.

770
01:22:26,325 --> 01:22:28,589
I would never hurt her.

771
01:22:30,863 --> 01:22:32,464
I love her.

772
01:22:32,464 --> 01:22:34,265
You brought him in?

773
01:22:34,265 --> 01:22:37,835
He walked in,
looking for you.

774
01:22:37,835 --> 01:22:39,070
He brought in
a pair of shoes.

775
01:22:39,070 --> 01:22:41,061
He was worried
about your feet.

776
01:22:46,812 --> 01:22:48,379
I believe your husband...

777
01:22:48,379 --> 01:22:51,249
has the potential
for violence.

778
01:22:51,249 --> 01:22:54,117
I believe he's unpredictable.

779
01:22:54,117 --> 01:22:56,416
But is he a murderer?

780
01:22:57,688 --> 01:22:59,018
I don't know.

781
01:23:00,756 --> 01:23:02,858
The truth is, what you two
have been doing together...

782
01:23:02,858 --> 01:23:04,450
was consensual.

783
01:23:05,460 --> 01:23:07,087
You said it yourself.

784
01:23:08,797 --> 01:23:09,822
You liked it.

785
01:23:30,050 --> 01:23:32,246
Can you close the blinds?

786
01:23:45,532 --> 01:23:48,864
I won't be able to keep him
for much more than a few hours.

787
01:23:51,237 --> 01:23:53,172
That's as much of a window
as I can give you.

788
01:23:53,172 --> 01:23:55,975
You're accusing a hero,
Mrs. Tallis...

789
01:23:55,975 --> 01:23:58,601
and you have
absolutely no evidence.

790
01:24:12,891 --> 01:24:14,426
Alice, what's happened to you?

791
01:24:14,426 --> 01:24:16,527
Oh, Deborah, I'm sorry.

792
01:24:16,527 --> 01:24:18,229
I'm not crazy,
I just--I just--

793
01:24:18,229 --> 01:24:19,463
I went to
the police station...

794
01:24:19,463 --> 01:24:21,832
but no one believed me,
and I just--I just--

795
01:24:21,832 --> 01:24:23,099
He came in and he
brought my shoes...

796
01:24:23,099 --> 01:24:24,402
and they thought
I was nuts...

797
01:24:24,402 --> 01:24:25,669
but, I mean, I know
he's your brother...

798
01:24:25,669 --> 01:24:27,203
but, I mean,
you were her friend, too.

799
01:24:27,203 --> 01:24:29,072
Maybe you could, um--

800
01:24:29,072 --> 01:24:30,340
Look, you remember when
you said that you were...

801
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:32,808
either with him or not,
no discussion?

802
01:24:32,808 --> 01:24:34,943
Well, I'm--I'm not--
I'm trying to understand.

803
01:24:34,943 --> 01:24:39,176
I--I just, I want to ask,
I mean, um--uh...

804
01:24:41,284 --> 01:24:43,514
Was Francoise
with someone else?

805
01:24:50,692 --> 01:24:51,681
Yes.

806
01:24:55,495 --> 01:24:57,297
It wasn't an accident.

807
01:24:57,297 --> 01:24:58,526
She left him...

808
01:24:59,533 --> 01:25:01,433
so he killed her.

809
01:25:10,110 --> 01:25:11,099
Maybe.

810
01:25:20,887 --> 01:25:23,823
This is the anchor
that we used.

811
01:25:23,823 --> 01:25:26,759
It's made of titanium,
but the important thing is...

812
01:25:26,759 --> 01:25:29,761
it can hold
2,000 falling pounds.

813
01:25:29,761 --> 01:25:31,096
I've got a friend
in Kathmandu...

814
01:25:31,096 --> 01:25:33,898
who sent me an anchor
that they're making locally...

815
01:25:33,898 --> 01:25:35,567
with the wrong material.

816
01:25:35,567 --> 01:25:39,437
This is what happened
with just seventy-five pounds.

817
01:25:39,437 --> 01:25:41,707
Maybe you're right.

818
01:25:41,707 --> 01:25:43,709
Adam could have
switched the anchors...

819
01:25:43,709 --> 01:25:44,936
for Francoise's group.

820
01:25:49,981 --> 01:25:51,173
He killed them.

821
01:26:29,850 --> 01:26:31,886
Leave him, Alice.

822
01:26:31,886 --> 01:26:33,355
I know him.

823
01:26:33,355 --> 01:26:35,050
You have to leave him,
for your own good.

824
01:26:37,658 --> 01:26:41,162
Deborah...Deborah,
it's not the only time.

825
01:26:41,162 --> 01:26:42,296
What?

826
01:26:42,296 --> 01:26:43,898
I think that, um,
he was with a woman...

827
01:26:43,898 --> 01:26:45,199
Adele Blanchard,
and I think...

828
01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:47,268
that she was gonna leave him
to go back to her husband...

829
01:26:47,268 --> 01:26:50,099
and--and I think that--
that he killed her.

830
01:26:51,270 --> 01:26:53,605
Adele was never gonna
go back to Michael.

831
01:26:53,605 --> 01:26:56,039
Everyone knew
their marriage was over.

832
01:26:57,775 --> 01:26:59,106
I read her letters.

833
01:27:00,112 --> 01:27:03,047
She ended it with Adam.

834
01:27:04,550 --> 01:27:07,018
And, uh, Ijust, um...

835
01:27:07,018 --> 01:27:09,955
I think that, uh,
that she's there.

836
01:27:09,955 --> 01:27:10,943
What?

837
01:27:13,925 --> 01:27:15,092
I went to the police.

838
01:27:15,092 --> 01:27:16,093
The police,
they won't do anything.

839
01:27:16,093 --> 01:27:17,082
They need evidence.

840
01:27:19,096 --> 01:27:21,199
I think he buried her here...

841
01:27:21,199 --> 01:27:22,256
at Saint Edmund's.

842
01:27:23,266 --> 01:27:25,325
I need you
to help me find her.

843
01:27:26,903 --> 01:27:28,370
Do you want to go with me?

844
01:27:41,918 --> 01:27:44,408
I have a confession to make.

845
01:27:46,721 --> 01:27:47,779
I sent you those notes.

846
01:27:49,122 --> 01:27:52,492
I know about
my brother's violence.

847
01:27:52,492 --> 01:27:54,016
I've seen it.

848
01:27:56,965 --> 01:27:58,967
I should have done more, but--

849
01:27:58,967 --> 01:28:00,558
it's no excuse--

850
01:28:02,502 --> 01:28:04,265
but he scares me.

851
01:28:09,076 --> 01:28:11,237
I'm glad you got away
from him, Alice.

852
01:28:13,313 --> 01:28:15,610
You'll be OK now.

853
01:29:53,606 --> 01:29:54,807
Can I take that?

854
01:29:54,807 --> 01:29:56,104
Yeah, sure.

855
01:29:58,778 --> 01:30:00,176
I think it's here.

856
01:30:01,680 --> 01:30:04,843
He took the pictures
just by the angel.

857
01:30:47,255 --> 01:30:48,688
Oh, my God.

858
01:31:30,830 --> 01:31:32,661
She didn't have to die.

859
01:31:36,534 --> 01:31:37,601
If only she'd told me...

860
01:31:37,601 --> 01:31:39,466
she was going back
to Michael.

861
01:31:42,640 --> 01:31:43,698
Yeah.

862
01:31:46,075 --> 01:31:48,010
I gave her one, too.

863
01:31:49,914 --> 01:31:51,982
She thought it was beautiful,
just like you did.

864
01:31:51,982 --> 01:31:54,007
Why did you do this?!

865
01:32:00,023 --> 01:32:02,324
Who do you think gave him
his first piece of silk?

866
01:32:02,324 --> 01:32:03,959
He was just 15!

867
01:32:03,959 --> 01:32:06,588
I'm talking
about fucking, Alice!

868
01:32:08,096 --> 01:32:10,894
That's right!
We fucked right here!

869
01:32:17,639 --> 01:32:19,809
Adam is mine!

870
01:32:19,809 --> 01:32:21,173
He's mine!

871
01:32:37,757 --> 01:32:39,692
Why?!

872
01:32:39,692 --> 01:32:42,428
I was never yours!

873
01:32:42,428 --> 01:32:45,057
We were kids. Kids!

874
01:32:47,067 --> 01:32:48,702
It's over.

875
01:32:48,702 --> 01:32:49,963
It's all over.

876
01:32:58,244 --> 01:32:59,677
Oh, God.

877
01:34:03,270 --> 01:34:04,669
She and l...

878
01:34:09,676 --> 01:34:11,872
We used to come
here together.

879
01:34:18,118 --> 01:34:20,813
I just thought
you had to trust me.

880
01:35:08,298 --> 01:35:09,765
And that's how it ended.

881
01:35:10,899 --> 01:35:13,136
Yet not a day goes by...

882
01:35:13,136 --> 01:35:16,505
without at least one thought
about the passion.

883
01:35:16,505 --> 01:35:18,907
Maybe I was so blinded by it...

884
01:35:18,907 --> 01:35:23,036
that I missed all the clues
to his past.

885
01:35:32,853 --> 01:35:35,087
I often wonder...

886
01:35:35,087 --> 01:35:36,424
what would have happened...

887
01:35:36,424 --> 01:35:39,153
if I hadn't looked up
that morning.

888
01:35:48,334 --> 01:35:52,100
Two years later,
I saw him once more.

889
01:36:30,172 --> 01:36:31,435
I don't know.

890
01:36:32,641 --> 01:36:34,778
Maybe a flatlander like me...

891
01:36:34,778 --> 01:36:37,177
can't live at that altitude.

892
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:40,148
Maybe it never would
have been possible...

893
01:36:40,148 --> 01:36:42,481
to sustain what we had.

894
01:36:43,952 --> 01:36:44,941
Maybe.

895
01:36:47,122 --> 01:36:49,783
Well, that's what
I tell myself.

896
01:36:49,784 --> 01:37:00,784
