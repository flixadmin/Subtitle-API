Almost two weeks. No traces, no witnesses.

140

We haven't received the shift schedules

That's good. Check that out.

- Jankowski, talk to the Obendorfs again.
- Okay.

147
00:19:11,528 --> 00:19:13,444
For all we know he ran away.

148
00:19:15,444 --> 00:19:17,277

00:20:29,944 --> 00:20:32,587
And then inside that there are neutrons.

152
00:20:32,611 --> 00:20:34,962
Well, more like neutron matter.

153

But not enough of it.

00:20:36,153 --> 00:20:38,235
So when the light of a star

00:20:38,569 --> 00:20:43,027
that is three times the mass of the sun,
is extinguished... it explodes.

No, it implodes.

157
00:20:45,486 --> 00:20:47,485
And it turns into a black hole.

158
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:49,235
And...

159
00:20:52,736 --> 00:20:54,235

Bartosz, you may continue.

168
00:21:28,069 --> 00:21:29,235
Mm-hmm.

169
00:21:30,528 --> 00:21:33,110
So then we have a black hole.

170
00:21:33,694 --> 00:21:35,735
It has a huge gravitational pull.

171
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:40,819
Everything around the hole is pulled
towards it and dragged inside of it.

172
00:21:41,819 --> 00:21:45,235
Other stars, planets, even light.

173
00:21:46,194 --> 00:21:48,920
The gravitational force is so strong

174
00:21:48,944 --> 00:21:50,902
that even light is pulled into it.

175
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:54,360
Nothing can escape once it's inside.

176
00:21:55,653 --> 00:21:57,902
Basically, no one knows what's behind it.

177
00:21:58,153 --> 00:22:01,277
Maybe nothing, or maybe a new world...

178
00:22:01,569 --> 00:22:04,777
in which nothing is as we know it.

179
00:22:06,944 --> 00:22:11,235
All I'm asking is to view the schedules
of your employees on that day.

180
00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:15,319
Erik was last seen
walking on the forest road.

181
00:22:15,653 --> 00:22:20,694
We could compare employees' tire tracks
with the tracks we found.

182
00:22:22,986 --> 00:22:24,694
And do you have a court order?

183
00:22:25,653 --> 00:22:27,027
I don't have a warrant.

184
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:29,985
It's a request.

185
00:22:34,736 --> 00:22:36,735
I'll have the schedules sent to you.

186
00:22:46,069 --> 00:22:47,527
So how are you?

187
00:22:53,569 --> 00:22:54,735
All right.

188
00:22:57,403 --> 00:22:58,569
Okay then.

189
00:23:06,736 --> 00:23:08,194
I've been wondering...

190
00:23:09,028 --> 00:23:12,110
Do you think Erik
could have made his way onto the grounds?

191
00:23:13,153 --> 00:23:15,819
The caves extend out
under the power plant.

192
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:17,735
No, that's impossible.

193
00:23:19,944 --> 00:23:22,444
The access points
were sealed up years ago.

194
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,319
No one can get in that way.

195
00:23:28,444 --> 00:23:29,610
Okay then.

196
00:23:41,694 --> 00:23:45,295
<i>Reminder:
no activities today after four o'clock</i>

197
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:47,545
<i>due to the parents' assembly,</i>

198
00:23:47,569 --> 00:23:49,879
<i>with the exception of the drama club,</i>

199
00:23:49,903 --> 00:23:52,295
<i>which must leave the auditorium
an hour early.</i>

200
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:57,444
<i>Mr. Hopf will supervise the student paper
meeting at the youth cafe today.</i>

201
00:24:09,694 --> 00:24:10,860
Katharina.

202
00:24:18,569 --> 00:24:19,819
Why are you here?

203
00:24:20,944 --> 00:24:23,069
- I wanted to see you.
- Uh-huh.

204
00:24:27,194 --> 00:24:28,569
I don't know...

205
00:24:30,528 --> 00:24:32,235
I know Ulrich and you...

206
00:24:32,944 --> 00:24:35,610
Ulrich and the kids, they...
They're part of him.

207
00:24:37,569 --> 00:24:40,110
And I want you to know
I'll stay out of the way.

208
00:24:42,153 --> 00:24:44,444
That's incredibly generous of you.

209
00:24:50,194 --> 00:24:52,152
Did Ulrich stop by this morning?

210
00:24:55,111 --> 00:24:57,027
He wanted to bring something over.

211
00:24:58,028 --> 00:24:59,569
What was he bringing?

212
00:24:59,819 --> 00:25:00,985
I'm not sure.

213
00:25:02,944 --> 00:25:05,277
It was... for school, for the kids.

214
00:25:11,361 --> 00:25:12,527
No.

215
00:25:15,819 --> 00:25:17,319
Well I guess he forgot.

216
00:25:41,194 --> 00:25:44,735
Please remember
to turn in your presentations next week.

217
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:46,277
No exceptions.

218
00:25:55,736 --> 00:25:56,902
What is it?

219
00:25:58,111 --> 00:26:00,360
You haven't told me yet why I'm here.

220
00:26:02,069 --> 00:26:03,360
Who are you?

221
00:26:07,111 --> 00:26:08,610
You really don't know me?

222
00:26:13,694 --> 00:26:14,860
You coming?

223
00:26:31,444 --> 00:26:34,277
ARIADNE A PLAY

224
00:26:36,444 --> 00:26:38,110
Jonas, right?

225
00:26:42,278 --> 00:26:43,444
Everything okay?

226
00:26:45,111 --> 00:26:46,569
What day is it today?

227
00:26:48,819 --> 00:26:50,027
November 4.

228
00:26:52,028 --> 00:26:53,194
What year?

229
00:26:53,986 --> 00:26:55,254
2019.

230
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:56,652
Are you sure you're...

231
00:27:15,611 --> 00:27:16,777
Mom?

232
00:27:17,611 --> 00:27:18,777
I'm sorry?

233
00:27:21,944 --> 00:27:23,402
Did you say something?

234
00:27:26,944 --> 00:27:28,444
Are you okay?

235
00:28:01,611 --> 00:28:02,944
Charlotte?

236
00:28:23,528 --> 00:28:25,485
We have to stop doing this.

237
00:28:26,861 --> 00:28:29,610
That's not
what you were saying earlier today.

238
00:28:36,861 --> 00:28:38,652
Ulrich, not here.

239
00:28:40,944 --> 00:28:44,485
- Oh, uh... Sorry.
- What is it?

240
00:28:46,361 --> 00:28:49,610
Um... The, uh, tire treads.

241
00:28:49,944 --> 00:28:52,069
47 cars and two trucks.

242
00:28:52,403 --> 00:28:55,295
And there are
21,000 registered vehicles in Winden.

243
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:57,860
What am I supposed to do with that fact?

244
00:28:58,069 --> 00:28:59,319
I...

245
00:29:00,361 --> 00:29:01,338
No idea.

246
00:29:01,362 --> 00:29:04,235
I have the shift schedules from the plant.
We'll do a comparison.

247
00:29:06,903 --> 00:29:08,069
Wöller.

248
00:29:19,903 --> 00:29:22,670
<i>That's when I knew
that nothing changes.</i>

249
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:24,444
<i>Everything remains the same.</i>

250
00:29:24,778 --> 00:29:26,694
The spinning wheel turns.

251
00:29:27,111 --> 00:29:29,152
Round and round.

252
00:29:30,028 --> 00:29:32,795
One destiny linked to the next.

253
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:34,485
A thread,

254
00:29:34,819 --> 00:29:36,504
blood-red,

255
00:29:36,528 --> 00:29:39,027
connects all our actions.

256
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:41,944
You cannot untie the knot.

257
00:29:42,486 --> 00:29:44,360
But you can cut through it.

258
00:29:45,486 --> 00:29:47,212
He cut through our knot,

259
00:29:47,236 --> 00:29:49,235
with a fine knife.

260
00:29:50,736 --> 00:29:54,069
And yet there's something
that remains inseverable.

261
00:29:54,486 --> 00:29:56,319
An invisible bond.

262
00:29:58,528 --> 00:30:00,587
Some nights he pulls on the bond,

263
00:30:00,611 --> 00:30:05,277
then I'm ripped from my sleep
and realize that nothing ever disappears.

264
00:30:05,611 --> 00:30:07,360
That everything remains.

265
00:30:13,236 --> 00:30:16,110
And they were blind with eyes and hearts,

266
00:30:16,736 --> 00:30:20,212
so they were punished for their sins.
Here and now.

267
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:24,754
What was in flight plummeted to the Earth.
What was on the Earth changed its shape.

268
00:30:24,778 --> 00:30:26,879
Revealed its grotesque face,

269
00:30:26,903 --> 00:30:29,985
which was nothing more
than unholy blasphemy made flesh.

270
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:38,485
Great. We'll stop here.

271
00:30:38,694 --> 00:30:41,027
We have to finish early today.

272
00:30:41,361 --> 00:30:44,295
Let's get things tidy
for the parents' meeting this evening.

273
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:45,485
Thank you all.

274
00:30:48,486 --> 00:30:51,027
Nine o'clock by the bridge. Don't forget.

275
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,485
Martha.

276
00:31:06,361 --> 00:31:09,860
Hey, I don't know what you want from me,
but I don't have it, okay?

277
00:31:10,528 --> 00:31:11,694
So go away.

278
00:31:14,986 --> 00:31:17,754
Please listen to me.
Maybe you don't know who I am.

279
00:31:17,778 --> 00:31:20,694
- But today is November 4 and Mikkel...
- What? Mikkel?

280
00:31:23,403 --> 00:31:26,045
Michael Kahnwald. Hannah's husband.
He's not who you think...

281
00:31:26,069 --> 00:31:27,777
Hannah's husband? Are you for real?

282
00:31:30,653 --> 00:31:32,527
I don't know any Michael Kahnwald.

283
00:31:33,569 --> 00:31:35,860
Hannah's husband is my father, Ulrich.

284
00:31:37,819 --> 00:31:40,569
I don't know what your deal is,
but just fuck off already, okay?

285
00:32:54,486 --> 00:32:56,902
Wait. Not so fast.

286
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:51,694
I...

287
00:33:52,069 --> 00:33:53,652
love you.

288
00:33:57,528 --> 00:34:00,319
I love you.

289
00:34:16,944 --> 00:34:19,027
It will happen again.

290
00:34:20,236 --> 00:34:21,902
It will...

291
00:34:22,569 --> 00:34:24,319
happen again.

292
00:34:25,194 --> 00:34:27,402
It will happen again.

293
00:34:30,028 --> 00:34:31,194
Mom?

294
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:32,546
Dad?

295
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,652
It will happen again.

296
00:34:35,236 --> 00:34:36,485
It will...

297
00:34:37,486 --> 00:34:39,277
happen again.

298
00:34:42,028 --> 00:34:43,610
Ticktock.

299
00:34:45,028 --> 00:34:46,212
Ticktock.

300
00:34:46,236 --> 00:34:48,610
- Grandpa, are you okay?
- Ticktock.

301
00:34:48,861 --> 00:34:51,235
Ticktock.

302
00:34:52,486 --> 00:34:54,444
The beginning is the end.

303
00:34:54,861 --> 00:34:57,694
The end is the beginning.

304
00:35:05,111 --> 00:35:06,694
Ticktock.

305
00:35:09,028 --> 00:35:10,527
Ticktock.

306
00:35:36,903 --> 00:35:38,152
Can I help you?

307
00:35:50,861 --> 00:35:52,319
Looking for something?

308
00:35:54,778 --> 00:35:57,360
I wanted to know
if someone was buried here.

309
00:35:57,944 --> 00:35:59,110
Who?

310
00:36:02,319 --> 00:36:03,610
Kahnwald.

311
00:36:04,611 --> 00:36:06,152
Michael Kahnwald.

312
00:36:08,403 --> 00:36:11,069
No, but Daniel Kahnwald's here.
He died in '64.

313
00:36:11,861 --> 00:36:13,110
No Michael Kahnwald.

314
00:36:17,194 --> 00:36:19,194
That could be why I'm here.

315
00:36:22,236 --> 00:36:23,527
So it doesn't happen.

316
00:36:25,403 --> 00:36:26,610
What doesn't happen?

317
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:29,819
Do I know you?

318
00:36:32,028 --> 00:36:34,444
I feel as if I've seen you
somewhere before.

319
00:36:45,361 --> 00:36:46,527
Hey, wait!

320
00:36:47,944 --> 00:36:49,110
What's your name?

321
00:37:35,361 --> 00:37:36,527
Hello?

322
00:37:45,528 --> 00:37:49,110
I'm sorry, can I help you?
Are you lost or something?

323
00:38:01,486 --> 00:38:03,152
The master key.

324
00:38:04,611 --> 00:38:06,360
For the power plant.

325
00:38:06,736 --> 00:38:08,444
Surely this is a joke.

326
00:38:09,111 --> 00:38:10,610
You kept it hidden.

327
00:38:12,944 --> 00:38:14,777
Do you think this is funny?

328
00:38:32,653 --> 00:38:35,569
If you don't leave,
I'll have to call the police.

329
00:38:58,944 --> 00:39:00,110
<i>Police...</i>

330
00:39:14,819 --> 00:39:16,277
What do you want from me?

331
00:39:28,403 --> 00:39:29,694
Nothing is free.

332
00:39:31,611 --> 00:39:33,027
No breath you take.

333
00:39:34,278 --> 00:39:35,485
No action.

334
00:39:36,653 --> 00:39:37,819
No word.

335
00:39:39,528 --> 00:39:40,860
No pain.

336
00:39:43,986 --> 00:39:46,735
An everlasting miracle...

337
00:39:47,403 --> 00:39:48,569
of oneness.

338
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:51,277
Who the hell do you think you are?

339
00:40:40,944 --> 00:40:42,360
The police came by today.

340
00:40:43,611 --> 00:40:45,652
You know what you have to do.

341
00:42:01,694 --> 00:42:02,860
Kilian?

342
00:42:06,111 --> 00:42:08,027
Stop messing around.

343
00:42:21,153 --> 00:42:22,319
What are you doing?

344
00:42:25,486 --> 00:42:26,652
What do you want?

345
00:42:27,403 --> 00:42:29,277
I don't want to scare you.

346
00:42:30,361 --> 00:42:33,110
- Why'd you say we know each other?
- Because we do.

347
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:35,860
Not now. In another time.

348
00:42:39,069 --> 00:42:40,485
What are you saying?

349
00:42:56,694 --> 00:42:58,152
You've seen this before.

350
00:42:59,403 --> 00:43:00,569
The light.

351
00:43:01,528 --> 00:43:03,194
The trees. Me.

352
00:43:08,194 --> 00:43:09,694
It's déjà vu.

353
00:43:10,653 --> 00:43:12,485
Or a glitch in the matrix.

354
00:43:14,194 --> 00:43:15,360
What?

355
00:43:19,111 --> 00:43:20,985
I think I know why I'm here.

356
00:43:22,736 --> 00:43:24,069
Why you came for me.

357
00:43:25,653 --> 00:43:27,027
So I might change it.

358
00:43:29,778 --> 00:43:30,944
Change what?

359
00:43:37,986 --> 00:43:39,152
Who's this then?

360
00:43:40,278 --> 00:43:42,777
- Where is Mikkel?
- Mikkel?

361
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:44,485
Mikkel isn't with you?

362
00:43:44,819 --> 00:43:46,337
You blind or something?

363
00:43:49,694 --> 00:43:50,944
What's he doing here?

364
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:53,735
You bring him along?

365
00:43:55,111 --> 00:43:56,444
What is this?

366
00:43:58,361 --> 00:44:00,629
- How do you know my brother?
- This can't be.

367
00:44:00,653 --> 00:44:04,170
You took him with you.
Heide, the babysitter, is sick.

368
00:44:04,194 --> 00:44:07,027
He didn't want to stay home alone.
That's why he came.

369
00:44:09,528 --> 00:44:11,712
I've no clue what the hell's going on,

370
00:44:11,736 --> 00:44:14,485
but Mikkel
is old enough to look after himself.

371
00:44:14,819 --> 00:44:16,735
Now you'd better fuck off.

372
00:44:17,653 --> 00:44:18,819
Get lost, freak.

373
00:44:25,194 --> 00:44:26,360
Come on.

374
00:44:29,528 --> 00:44:30,694
Martha.

375
00:44:46,278 --> 00:44:49,860
POLICE

376
00:44:52,444 --> 00:44:55,694
Charlotte, I'm going
to the parents' meeting.

377
00:44:56,111 --> 00:44:57,944
I'd be happy to give you a lift.

378
00:45:00,403 --> 00:45:01,569
Sure.

379
00:45:03,111 --> 00:45:04,569
- Follow this up?
- Mm-hmm.

380
00:45:13,861 --> 00:45:15,787
We need to reach out
to these names.

381
00:45:54,903 --> 00:45:56,777
Why did he act like he knew you?

382
00:45:59,153 --> 00:46:01,569
- Does he?
- No.

383
00:46:01,944 --> 00:46:03,110
Who knows.

384
00:46:06,486 --> 00:46:09,985
Did you know Nostradamus predicted
that the world would end this year?

385
00:46:10,528 --> 00:46:12,069
What a load of shit.

386
00:46:13,278 --> 00:46:14,652
No. Really.

387
00:46:15,153 --> 00:46:17,527
The apocalypse is just around the corner.

388
00:46:18,278 --> 00:46:20,735
Glad I got a girlfriend
with her own bunker then.

389
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:23,069
What?

390
00:46:23,653 --> 00:46:24,920
Nothing.

391
00:46:24,944 --> 00:46:26,004
Ow!

392
00:46:26,028 --> 00:46:27,569
What?

393
00:47:05,236 --> 00:47:08,360
What do you think
you'll find here?

394
00:47:08,903 --> 00:47:10,989
Erik sometimes
spent summer nights here.

395
00:47:14,403 --> 00:47:16,319
The police might have missed something.

396
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:21,444
Ever heard the story of the cave monster?

397
00:47:21,653 --> 00:47:24,402
- Skip the bullshit, man.
- No, this is legit.

398
00:47:25,569 --> 00:47:27,045
About 100 years ago,

399
00:47:27,069 --> 00:47:30,337
just after the war,
they did experiments in the caves.

400
00:47:30,361 --> 00:47:31,879
What kind of experiments?

401
00:47:33,778 --> 00:47:35,485
- What was that?
- What?

402
00:47:43,236 --> 00:47:44,402
Shit.

403
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:46,129
What's in the cave?

404
00:47:46,153 --> 00:47:47,527
- What is that?
- Oh, shit!

405
00:47:47,819 --> 00:47:49,629
- Fuck!
- What's going on?

406
00:47:49,653 --> 00:47:51,337
- Fuck! What's happening?
- Run!

407
00:47:51,361 --> 00:47:53,152
- What's with the flashlights?
- Kilian!

408
00:47:53,403 --> 00:47:55,194
- Hurry up!
- Martha!

409
00:47:55,528 --> 00:47:57,004
- Martha, come on.
- Run!

410
00:47:57,028 --> 00:47:58,735
Run! Run!

411
00:48:14,819 --> 00:48:15,985
Kilian?

412
00:48:21,236 --> 00:48:22,444
Kilian?

413
00:48:28,236 --> 00:48:30,319
Martha.

- Is it over?
- I think so.

432
00:51:34,569 --> 00:51:35,860
What...

433
00:51:36,403 --> 00:51:38,110
What is that?

434
00:51:39,528 --> 00:51:40,694
Oh, God.

435
00:51:44,111 --> 00:51:45,295
- Fuck.
- Fuck!

436
00:51:45,319 --> 00:51:47,069
Shit.

437
00:51:47,944 --> 00:51:50,087
Oh, shit. Shit.

438
00:51:50,111 --> 00:51:51,277
Fuck.

439
00:51:56,569 --> 00:51:58,319
- Is he dead?
- Fuck.

440
00:51:58,778 --> 00:52:00,712
Yes, I think so.

441
00:52:00,736 --> 00:52:03,319
Who... Who is that?

442
00:52:08,778 --> 00:52:11,110
STUDENT CARD
MADS NIELSEN, DECEMBER 4,1973

443
00:52:13,986 --> 00:52:15,360
Mads Nielsen.

444
00:52:53,694 --> 00:52:55,985
I've waited for this moment for so long.

445
00:52:57,819 --> 00:52:59,485
For you to come back.

446
00:53:03,903 --> 00:53:05,194
What is this?

447
00:53:16,569 --> 00:53:17,735
Mikkel.

448
00:53:18,528 --> 00:53:20,652
He didn't travel back.

449
00:53:21,528 --> 00:53:23,545
He won't become your father.

450
00:53:23,569 --> 00:53:24,735
And you...

451
00:53:25,153 --> 00:53:27,152
will never be born here.

452
00:53:28,444 --> 00:53:31,360
A world... without you.

453
00:53:32,694 --> 00:53:34,444
Isn't that what you wanted?

454
00:53:38,194 --> 00:53:39,360
Yet, despite that,

455
00:53:40,153 --> 00:53:44,485
this world has the same fate,
it's been damned, like yours.

456
00:53:45,944 --> 00:53:47,694
Everything will fall apart.

457
00:53:48,903 --> 00:53:51,027
In this world just as it will in yours.

458
00:53:53,153 --> 00:53:55,360
Again and again.

459
00:53:57,486 --> 00:53:58,694
Because of you.

460
00:54:06,653 --> 00:54:07,819
And because of me.

461
00:54:14,778 --> 00:54:16,069
Martha.

462
00:55:26,903 --> 00:55:28,069
Jonas?

463
00:56:16,236 --> 00:56:17,694
You're alive.

464
00:56:22,153 --> 00:56:23,652
You're alive.

465
00:56:35,403 --> 00:56:36,860
I am not Martha.

466
00:56:44,194 --> 00:56:45,444
Not your Martha.

467
00:56:51,528 --> 00:56:53,402
What does that mean?

468
00:57:00,778 --> 00:57:03,152
I came here to help you find the origin.

469
00:57:05,611 --> 00:57:07,194
The one thing...

470
00:57:08,361 --> 00:57:10,652
that's the beginning of everything.

471
00:57:11,986 --> 00:57:13,194
In your world...

472
00:57:17,944 --> 00:57:19,129
and in mine.
