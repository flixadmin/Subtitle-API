<i>Look at the stars.</i>

<i>Whenever you feel alone,</i>

5
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:52,083
<i>the great kings of the past</i>

<i>And so will I.</i>

8
00:02:15,416 --> 00:02:19,541
My friends, the time of
my family's growth is upon us.

9
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:22,999
This home we share
is the fulfillment

10
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,500
of my father's vision.

11
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:26,749
How wonderful is it
that Nala and I

12
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,666
get to continue his dream

13
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:31,415
and make even greater
the Circle of Life?

14
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,875
Nala, my love, I'm on my way.

15
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,458
Simba...

16
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,583
I'm here.

17
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:25,250
I'm here.

18
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:40,791
Security detail
has arrived!

19
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,458
One gentle reminder:
we are not food.

20
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:45,625
No, no, no, no, no.
We are just two guys

21
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:48,083
walking to work through
a pride of hungry lions.

22
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:50,958
Which is perfectly
normal. I'm not terrified.

23
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,790
Security detail
reporting for duty,

24
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,500
Your Grace, Your Highness...

25
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:58,083
Ruler of all
four-legged creatures.

26
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,458
And that one
three-legged zebra.

27
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,875
Oh, right, Ron.
That was tragic.

28
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,333
- It was an eat-and-Ron.
- Yeah.

29
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,415
Ron has three legs.
That's still one more than me.

30
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:07,624
- Well, are those arms or legs?
-  Guys.

31
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:08,707
I don't know.
I think they're paws.

32
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:09,790
Guys.

33
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,416
- I consider all those legs.
- Guys! This is serious.

34
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,500
I need you to stay with Kiara
until I get back.

35
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:17,415
Are you saying
that your security detail

36
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:20,291
has been called on
to do babysitting?

37
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:21,874
Pumbaa, we should
really discuss this

38
00:04:21,875 --> 00:04:23,375
because I don't really love...

39
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:26,000
Guys, I promised her
everything would be okay.

40
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,291
Well, that's one way
to parent.

41
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:28,500
She's gonna
have to grow up sometime.

42
00:04:28,666 --> 00:04:29,665
What else did you tell her,

43
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,250
that she could be
whatever she wants to be?

44
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,458
That life is fair?

45
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,916
I need you two to try
and act like adults, okay?

46
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:38,125
Don't scare Kiara.
And most of all, no stories.

47
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,749
- No stories?
- Wait a second.

48
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,832
I know where your head goes.

49
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:42,458
I grew up with you two.
Promise me.

50
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:43,999
Okay. You know what,
you know what, you know what?

51
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,416
Fine. No stories.

52
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:46,958
Speak for yourself, Pumbaa.

53
00:04:47,125 --> 00:04:49,165
No. Pssh.
We'll tell a story anyway.

54
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,415
Okay, we'll tell
him that we're not gonna

55
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:51,499
tell a story and then
we're gonna tell a story.

56
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,791
- He can't stop us.
- Are you guys serious?

57
00:04:52,958 --> 00:04:54,500
I'm clearly within earshot.

58
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:55,791
Dad.

59
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,333
Hey, little one.

60
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:04,166
Dad, the storm's coming,
and I'm scared.

61
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:05,833
I wanna go with you and Mom.

62
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,541
- Don't be scared, my love.
- Mmm.

63
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,750
Timon and Pumbaa
will watch you while I'm gone.

64
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:11,375
Be brave now, Kiara.

65
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,000
Be brave.

66
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:21,082
Okay!
We've prepared a story.

67
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,625
<i>Scar looked at us.</i>

68
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:26,875
<i>He knew it was
the end of the line.</i>

69
00:05:27,041 --> 00:05:28,875
<i>I could smell the fear.</i>

70
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,166
<i>That was actually me,
but yes.</i>

71
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,791
<i>So you two
defeated Scar?</i>

72
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,041
And then you ate him?

73
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,208
Honestly, one of the best
meals I ever had.

74
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,291
My dad told me
he defeated Scar.

75
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:57,832
Well, okay. But your dad,

76
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,416
as we all know,
is a pathological liar.

77
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,666
He's always lyin'. Get it?

78
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:07,333
I'm scared.
I want Mom and Dad.

79
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,625
Look, look, look
look, look.

80
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,416
Don't be scared, Kiara.

81
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:14,000
How about we sing you a song?
And, a-one...

82
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,666
Pumbaa, no, it is
way too early for the song.

83
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:17,832
It worked on Simba.

84
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:19,291
He thought he had
murdered his own father.

85
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:21,291
He was singin' and dancin'
around in seconds.

86
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:22,874
I can't just
turn it on like that.

87
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:24,416
I have to be in the moment.

88
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:25,791
He sang that song
for six years straight.

89
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:27,375
Well, who didn't?

90
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:28,665
Look!

91
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:29,874
- No!
- It's Ron,

92
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,957
the three-legged zebra.
Run for your lives!

93
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,333
He heard what we've been
sayin' about him.

94
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,291
We're sorry, Ron. They were
jokes. They were just jokes!

95
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:37,916
It's Rafiki.

96
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,915
Rafiki! Rafiki!

97
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,833
Little one,
there's no reason to cry.

98
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
My parents...

99
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:47,540
they're gone.

100
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:50,208
Hey. Look out there, <i>mdogo.</i>

101
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:53,250
You see those baobab trees
blowing in the wind?

102
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:58,041
The roots of those trees are
very strong, like your family.

103
00:06:58,208 --> 00:07:00,083
And, just as they did for you,

104
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,750
your parents have gone to the
ceremonial birthing grounds.

105
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:06,915
And when they return,
the Circle of Life

106
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:10,041
will bring a blessing
to you, Kiara,

107
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,540
that you will never forget.

108
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:13,624
Man, he's good.

109
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:15,458
He's such
a visual storyteller.

110
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,708
Yet it makes sense
that he lives alone.

111
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,749
I just want the storm to pass,

112
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,999
and then I promise
to be brave.

113
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,708
I'll tell you a secret.

114
00:07:25,875 --> 00:07:28,250
When your father Simba
was your age,

115
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:30,249
he was afraid of the thunder

116
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,250
and would hide
behind the king.

117
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:33,625
When did he stop hiding?

118
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:35,875
One day, during a big storm,

119
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,790
your grandfather Mufasa
took your father

120
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,166
to the very top of Pride Rock,

121
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:42,833
told him to stand with him

122
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,875
and howl into the wind.

123
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:47,833
And Simba slowly stepped out
with the king.

124
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,333
And together,
they roared into the night.

125
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,166
But I'm not brave like my dad.

126
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,665
And I could never be
like Mufasa.

127
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:00,458
Is that so?

128
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:04,166
Then maybe it's time
I tell you a story.

129
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,458
A story of a cub,
not much bigger than you.

130
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:11,125
A lion born without a drop
of nobility in his blood.

131
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:15,125
A lion who would change
our lives forever.

132
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,833
A story! So glad
I brought some crickets.

133
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,708
But go easy. We're in a cave.

134
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,500
This story
begins far beyond

135
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,500
the mountains and the shadows.

136
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,458
On the other side
of the light.

137
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:30,875
In this place, everything
was dying of thirst

138
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:33,290
as 20 full moons
had passed without

139
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:35,541
a single drop of water.

140
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,458
But when the skies
finally opened,

141
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,875
destiny would reign.

142
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:11,625
Mufasa.

143
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:15,208
Mufasa! Come see.

144
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,833
Mom, what is that light
way out there?

145
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,666
Oh, that's very special.

146
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,458
Beyond the horizon,

147
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:31,750
beyond the last cloud
in the sky,

148
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:34,708
that's a place we call <i>Milele.</i>

149
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:35,916
<i>Milele?</i>

150
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,375
Hmm. It means, "forever."

151
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:41,625
Imagine
a kingdom full of life,

152
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,416
water and food,

153
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:48,375
grass and sky
as far as the eye can see.

154
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:49,666
Will we ever go there?

155
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,291
Oh, yes, Mufasa.

156
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,458
That's exactly
where we're headed.

157
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:56,625
But we can also
be there right now.

158
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,708
We can close our eyes.

159
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,166
Let our dreams take us.

What is this?

215
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,916
Rain. Rain!

216
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:21,207
Oh, finally we have rain!

217
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:27,790
Dad, race you to the light!

218
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,041
You're too fast.

219
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:30,791
I've never beaten you.

220
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,708
Nobody has ever beaten you.

221
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:34,541
I know!

222
00:12:35,125 --> 00:12:39,040
Mufasa!
Fastest cub in the world.

223
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,416
Thank you.

224
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,166
Mufasa...

225
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:14,290
that's enough.

226
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:17,000
Mufasa, come back now.

227
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,250
Mufasa, stay there!
I'm coming, son.

228
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,458
-  Father!
- Mufasa!

229
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,250
Mufasa?

230
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,875
I'll catch you on the turn.

231
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:54,458
Find my voice.

232
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,250
Find my voice!

233
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:57,583
Mom!

234
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:10,208
Mufasa, the cliff is too high,
but you can cross at the dam.

235
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:12,583
Come on, Mufasa,
you can do this.

236
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,291
Find your mother's voice.

237
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,291
Listen
to your father, Mufasa!

238
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:17,791
Listen to us!

239
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:21,875
Afia, he's there.

240
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,166
-  Mom!
-  He's there!

241
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,125
-  Mother!
- Mufasa!

242
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,958
Find your footing
one step at a time.

243
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:32,457
-  I can't.
- You can do this.

244
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:33,708
I'm right here.

245
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:49,166
Mufasa!

246
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:43,791
Mom?

247
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:45,416
Dad?

248
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,583
Can you hear me?

249
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,375
Is anyone out there?

250
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Mom?

251
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,083
Please.

252
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,750
I'm scared.

253
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,625
I'm scared.

254
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,541
<i>The floodwaters
joined a distant river,</i>

255
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:14,458
<i>carried Mufasa far
from his mother and father.</i>

256
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:16,750
<i>Beyond all that he knew.</i>

257
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,207
Hello.

258
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:49,166
I'm Taka, son of Obasi.
What's your name?

259
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:50,458
Mufasa.

260
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,333
I'm not allowed
to talk to Outsiders,

261
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,208
but I have a secret...

262
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:56,375
...and I really
want to tell you.

263
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,375
- What's the secret?
-  I'll get in trouble.

264
00:16:58,541 --> 00:16:59,541
Please, just tell me.

265
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,333
Uh... I don't know.

266
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,541
Just tell me!

267
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:04,874
Okay.
You're about to be eaten.

268
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:09,250
I hate secrets!

269
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,541
- Swim!
- But I can't!

270
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,333
- You have to swim.
- I don't know how!

271
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:17,583
All right. Chin up, then walk
underwater really fast.

272
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,958
I can't!

273
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,583
Come on, Mufasa. Faster!

274
00:17:23,291 --> 00:17:25,291
Help me, Taka! Help me!

275
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,375
I told you to wait for me.

276
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:41,833
It's not my fault, Mum.

277
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,500
I came down for a drink
and saw him floating by.

278
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,625
I'd like you to meet Mufasa.

279
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,499
You're lucky
those crocs were young

280
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,291
and afraid to fight. Let's go!

281
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:51,958
We can't just leave him here.

282
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,875
Rules are rules, Taka.

283
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:56,375
Obasi will never accept
a stray.

284
00:17:56,541 --> 00:18:00,291
I'm not a stray.
I'm just... lost.

285
00:18:00,458 --> 00:18:01,458
See?

286
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:03,875
He's just lost.

287
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,291
There was a...
a flood.

288
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,083
My parents,
they tried to save me.

289
00:18:12,041 --> 00:18:13,666
Do you know which way is home?

290
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:16,541
Home?

291
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:19,666
To be lost
is to learn the way.

292
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:21,750
Call me Eshe.

293
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,000
I'm tired, Eshe.

294
00:18:23,583 --> 00:18:25,124
Come on, it's this way.

295
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:43,958
Come on, Mufasa.

296
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,958
Is this <i>Milele?</i>

297
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,166
No, my love.

298
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,083
I was trying to nap, Eshe.

299
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,583
The all-important nap
of kings,

300
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,375
only to be awoken
by the disgusting,

301
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:13,125
hideous, revolting stench
of a stray.

302
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,416
When we come upon an Outsider,

303
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,958
tell me, what do we do?

304
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,875
Obasi, I know.

305
00:19:19,041 --> 00:19:20,041
Eat it.

306
00:19:20,208 --> 00:19:22,958
But I found him, Dad.
I saved his life.

307
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:26,666
Taka, we do not associate
with Outsiders.

308
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,666
The only true bond is blood.

309
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,750
I've heard stories of lions
twice our size.

310
00:19:32,916 --> 00:19:34,500
These Outsiders

311
00:19:34,666 --> 00:19:37,041
will devour everything
in their path.

312
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,708
Does he look like he's going
to devour you?

313
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:43,791
Whoa, that smell
is disgusting.

314
00:19:43,958 --> 00:19:46,125
I'm not even sure I could eat
this <i>kibeti!</i>

315
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,208
I'm not a <i>kibeti.</i>
I'm a Mufasa.

316
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:50,374
Do you even know
what "Mufasa" means?

317
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:51,833
-  No.
- It means, "king."

318
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,416
And that's me.

319
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:56,000
You better start running,
little Mufasa,

320
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:57,166
for your life.

321
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,375
If I run,
you'll never catch me.

322
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,000
I'm the fastest cub
that ever lived.

323
00:20:01,166 --> 00:20:02,207
My father told me so.

324
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,916
Ooh, Taka,
you have a challenge.

325
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,625
They will race
to the dead tree and back.

326
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,750
And when the prince
defeats him,

327
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:12,375
I will finish him in one bite.

328
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:14,500
What if Mufasa wins?

329
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,958
If he wins, he lives, Obasi.

330
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:19,333
He stays with me.

331
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,291
You have my word.

332
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,833
Let the race begin!

333
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,583
Ooh, clumsy little stray.

334
00:20:28,958 --> 00:20:30,166
Run, Mufasa!

335
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:31,916
You did not have to do that.

336
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,916
Taka
is the future king.

337
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,000
He has to win
his first challenge.

338
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:39,375
No, Obasi. To be a true king,
he must earn it.

339
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,041
Don't take that away from him.

340
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:39,416
Better hurry.

341
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,541
I have one more secret,
Mufasa.

342
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:08,166
I always wanted a brother.

343
00:22:26,041 --> 00:22:27,958
- Cheater!
- Obasi!

344
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:31,000
You will keep him
with the females.

345
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:36,500
Taka, how could you lose
to a stray?

346
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:38,583
Well done, Taka.

347
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,541
Well done.

348
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:42,791
I thought you said
you were fast.

349
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:44,040
I had to let you win.

350
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:45,124

351
00:22:45,125 --> 00:22:46,207
with no sleep
while riding the waves of...

352
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:48,832
Anyway, come on, Mufasa.

431
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:15,708
Elephant stampede!

432
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:17,457
Run for your lives!

433
00:26:27,083 --> 00:26:29,291
Chigaru jumped,
like, 20 feet.

434
00:26:29,458 --> 00:26:30,625
Oh, that's a new record.

435
00:26:30,791 --> 00:26:32,916
Obasi,
they did it again.

436
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:34,916
Your sons are nothing
but trouble.

437
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:37,083
That one is not my son.

438
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,166
They're heathens,
the both of them.

439
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:42,541
This stray is forbidden
to be near the Shade Tree.

440
00:26:42,708 --> 00:26:43,958
Mufasa and I were
just playing.

441
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:46,625
You two will
never be brothers.

442
00:26:46,791 --> 00:26:48,166
Now go back to the females

443
00:26:48,333 --> 00:26:51,041
and stay away from my son.

444
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:55,000
Oh, your mother,
she adopts every lizard,

445
00:26:55,166 --> 00:26:57,500
speaks to passing
grasshoppers.

446
00:26:57,666 --> 00:26:58,666
I want to go with him.

447
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:00,458
You want to be
with the females?

448
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:02,208
You belong with the males.

449
00:27:02,375 --> 00:27:04,166
He gets to hunt with Mother.

450
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:06,916
One day, he will betray you.

451
00:27:07,916 --> 00:27:09,666
That is what strays do.

452
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:11,250
Mufasa would never betray me.

453
00:27:11,416 --> 00:27:12,708
Hey, hey.

454
00:27:12,875 --> 00:27:15,625
This will all be yours,
my son.

455
00:27:15,791 --> 00:27:18,125
You will be king.

456
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:19,541
So pay attention.

457
00:27:20,416 --> 00:27:23,083
Study every move I make.

458
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:26,083
Sleeping again.

459
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,333
That is what males do.

460
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,666
We protect the pride
as we nap.

461
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:32,083
That's...

462
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,041
Well, that's power.

463
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:39,375
Power?

464
00:27:54,416 --> 00:27:55,583
Why are we stopping?

465
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:57,416
Close your eyes.

466
00:27:57,916 --> 00:27:59,875
And tell me what you hear.

467
00:28:00,708 --> 00:28:02,750
What you feel.

468
00:28:07,541 --> 00:28:10,083
There's
a herd of antelope

469
00:28:10,291 --> 00:28:12,666
heading across
the dry lakebed.

470
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:15,541
About half a day from here?

471
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,791
And how do you know
they're not gazelles?

472
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:21,041
Their steps
are too heavy.

473
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,541
- Moving way too slow.
-  What else?

474
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,125
Come on. You can do it.

475
00:28:26,291 --> 00:28:32,000
When the wind
hits their horns, it moves up

476
00:28:32,166 --> 00:28:36,041
instead of across.
So, definitely antelope horns.

477
00:28:36,208 --> 00:28:37,708
Very good.

478
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:46,125
What is it, Mufasa?
What's wrong?

479
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:48,125
Sometimes I get a scent.

480
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:50,666
It's barely a trace
on the wind.

481
00:28:50,833 --> 00:28:52,416
And it smells like home.

482
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Then it's gone.

483
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,958
Mufasa, your parents
are still out there.

484
00:29:01,125 --> 00:29:02,166
We can keep looking.

485
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:03,541
I lost them, Eshe.

486
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:05,833
You're wasting your time
training me like this.

487
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,875
But these skills you have,
no other male has them.

488
00:29:09,041 --> 00:29:11,250
Obasi will never accept me.

489
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,916
I'll never be his blood.
His family.

490
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:15,291
But you are my family.

491
00:29:15,458 --> 00:29:18,541
And if Obasi could see
how gifted you are...

492
00:29:18,708 --> 00:29:21,583
Well, maybe I like being
a stray, you know.

493
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:24,291
No rules, no responsibility.

494
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:25,958
I'm the lucky one,
Eshe.

495
00:29:26,125 --> 00:29:27,500
What do you mean, Mufasa?

496
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:29,666
I never have to be like Taka.

497
00:29:30,541 --> 00:29:32,291
I never have to be king.

498
00:29:45,458 --> 00:29:47,625
Did he say, "no rules
and no responsibility"?

499
00:29:47,791 --> 00:29:50,125
An outcast, afraid of water,
never takes a bath.

500
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:51,666
Which means he smells like me.

501
00:29:51,833 --> 00:29:53,083
Which is not good.

502
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:56,125
Well, either way, I think that
means that he's one of us.

503
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,000
-  This is it.
- It's our time!

504
00:29:58,166 --> 00:29:59,165
This is our moment.

505
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:01,291

and a-two and a-one, two...

Don't go there.

513
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:15,749
All right, all right,
Rafiki's right.

514
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,833
We'll get letters from legal.

515
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,708
Those vultures will take
everything we have.

516
00:30:18,875 --> 00:30:20,625
Which, technically,
is nothing.

517
00:30:20,791 --> 00:30:22,000
Look at us.
We're naked animals.

518
00:30:22,166 --> 00:30:23,458
No wonder I'm always freezing.

519
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:24,624
They want this!

520
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:25,708
Come on, Pumbaa.

521
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:26,833
Let's bring it home.

522
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,291
<i>♪ Hakuna Mufasa ♪</i>

523
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:29,458
Quiet!

524
00:30:29,916 --> 00:30:31,833
Kiara's a music snob.

525
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,916
Rafiki, keep going.

526
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:37,499
<i>Later that day,</i>

527
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:41,375
<i>Eshe was teaching Mufasa
how to hunt in pairs.</i>

528
00:30:41,625 --> 00:30:45,541
<i>But, as Taka was
secretly watching,</i>

529
00:30:45,708 --> 00:30:48,125
<i>something terrible
was hunting them.</i>

530
00:31:43,541 --> 00:31:44,625
Mufasa, run!

531
00:31:46,958 --> 00:31:48,000
Eshe!

532
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:49,791
Mother.

533
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:52,041
Mother!

534
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,250
Eshe!

535
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:11,375
Keep moving, Mufasa.

536
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,166
They go for the neck!

537
00:32:32,541 --> 00:32:34,000
It's okay, Mufasa.

538
00:32:34,791 --> 00:32:37,250
It's okay.

539
00:32:37,375 --> 00:32:38,833
It's okay.

540
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,500
That was very brave of you,
Mufasa.

541
00:32:41,666 --> 00:32:42,666
Thank you.

542
00:32:50,041 --> 00:32:51,291
Eshe...

543
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:52,833
What has happened?

544
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:56,291
Are you hurt?

545
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,458
They were huge.
White as ghosts.

546
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:02,125
Like nothing I've seen before.

547
00:33:04,375 --> 00:33:05,791
Oh, Obasi.

548
00:33:07,041 --> 00:33:09,625
Had Mufasa
not been there, I...

549
00:33:14,583 --> 00:33:15,583
Taka.

550
00:33:25,291 --> 00:33:29,291
I owe you
a great debt, Mufasa.

551
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:31,791
We need to prepare.

552
00:33:31,958 --> 00:33:34,541
They're downwind
less than a day away.

553
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:36,833
No.

554
00:33:37,375 --> 00:33:38,875
You couldn't possibly
know this.

555
00:33:39,041 --> 00:33:41,291
Send a scout and you'll see...

556
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,708
they'll be coming for us.

557
00:33:44,916 --> 00:33:45,916
Chigaru.

558
00:33:48,208 --> 00:33:50,458
Father, please,
let me explain.

559
00:33:50,625 --> 00:33:52,458
No. Not now.

560
00:33:54,541 --> 00:33:55,958
Taka, come.

561
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:18,208
Where is my son?

562
00:34:18,375 --> 00:34:20,291
There was a young lion,
Majesty.

563
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:21,666
He fought Shaju.

564
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:25,833
And yet you came back.

565
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:28,833
You survived.

566
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,083
I was badly hurt. I promise,
Majesty. This is the truth.

567
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:34,457
- The truth?
- Yes, the truth.

568
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,915
The truth is standing
behind you.

569
00:34:42,375 --> 00:34:44,666
- There were others, Majesty.
- No, no, no.

570
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,625
But only one left blood
on his mane.

571
00:34:46,791 --> 00:34:49,208
Which means
he left Shaju to die.

572
00:34:49,375 --> 00:34:50,666
Saved himself.

573
00:34:50,833 --> 00:34:53,708
This young lion,
was he their king?

574
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:55,333
His blood is common. Ordinary.

575
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,500
Answer me!

576
00:34:57,083 --> 00:34:59,708
Was he their king?

577
00:34:59,875 --> 00:35:04,375
No, Kiros,
you are the only king.

578
00:35:04,541 --> 00:35:07,583
An ordinary lion?

579
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:10,583
And you left my son to die?

580
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,625
I was injured.
There was no choice.

581
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:14,833
Please, Majesty,
you have to believe me.

582
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,083
There's no reason to fear me.

583
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,708
I would never harm
one of my own.

584
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,000
Thank you, Majesty.

585
00:35:22,833 --> 00:35:24,750
I'll leave that pleasure

586
00:35:24,916 --> 00:35:25,916
to them.

587
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:29,541
Majesty! No. Kiros!

588
00:35:30,333 --> 00:35:31,333
Kiros!

589
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,457
<i>No one
can ever know you ran.</i>

590
00:35:43,458 --> 00:35:45,250
<i>That you ran from your mother.</i>

591
00:35:46,125 --> 00:35:48,458
It never happened, Taka.
Do you understand?

592
00:35:48,625 --> 00:35:50,708
But I didn't know. I was
just... I was just scared.

593
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:54,833
It doesn't matter.
We must protect the bloodline.

594
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,083
Protect it with a lie?
Father, that's deceitful.

595
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:02,416
Deceit is a tool
of a great king.

596
00:36:03,958 --> 00:36:04,958
Taka...

597
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:08,875
it's what kings must do.

598
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,666
But I'm not a king.

599
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:12,416
I'm just your son.

600
00:36:12,875 --> 00:36:13,875
Obasi!

601
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:16,125
Chigaru.

602
00:36:16,291 --> 00:36:17,291
Obasi!

603
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:21,625
Chigaru, I'm here.
What did you see?

604
00:36:21,791 --> 00:36:23,291
They're coming
this way, Obasi.

605
00:36:23,458 --> 00:36:25,375
Two lions
for every one of ours.

606
00:36:25,541 --> 00:36:27,208
Each one bigger than the next,

607
00:36:27,375 --> 00:36:31,333
but none as mighty as Kiros,
their terrifying king.

608
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:33,291
Outsiders.

609
00:36:33,833 --> 00:36:35,750
The stories were all true.

610
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:39,000
I must protect
the bloodline, Eshe.

611
00:36:39,166 --> 00:36:41,041
The future of this pride.

612
00:36:41,583 --> 00:36:44,041
Taka, you are that future.

613
00:36:44,208 --> 00:36:46,041
Future? Dad, what do you mean?

614
00:36:46,875 --> 00:36:48,250
I'm sending you away.

615
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:50,333
Far from here.

616
00:36:51,166 --> 00:36:55,291
You will leave and start a new
life, a new beginning.

617
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,625
I need you to go with him,
Mufasa,

618
00:36:57,791 --> 00:36:59,416
to pledge your loyalty.

619
00:37:00,208 --> 00:37:01,958
They'll arrive
with the sunrise.

620
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,083
Where will we go, Eshe?

621
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:13,708
Without you, I have no home.

622
00:37:13,875 --> 00:37:16,958
Mufasa, you and Taka together.
That...

623
00:37:17,916 --> 00:37:19,000
- That is home.
- Eshe...

624
00:37:19,166 --> 00:37:20,833
Mufasa, look out there.

625
00:37:21,458 --> 00:37:22,583
Beyond the light...

626
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:24,041
You know what I see?

627
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:26,582
I see the place your mother
told you about,

628
00:37:26,583 --> 00:37:28,833
a place beyond
the river's end.

629
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,749
Across the deepest canyon

630
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,291
on the other side
of the mountains,

631
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,875
a place beyond
the horizon itself.

632
00:37:35,625 --> 00:37:37,208
A pride land so green,

633
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:40,208
so perfect

634
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:43,416
that to see it is to see

635
00:37:43,583 --> 00:37:44,750
<i>Milele.</i>

636
00:37:44,916 --> 00:37:47,500
Yes. Forever.

637
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:49,540
My parents spoke
of <i>Milele</i> often.

638
00:37:49,541 --> 00:37:51,750
My mother told me
it was where we were going.

639
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:53,416
And don't you see, Mufasa?

640
00:37:53,583 --> 00:37:54,708
You must keep going.

641
00:37:54,875 --> 00:37:57,125
You must continue your journey
toward the light.

642
00:37:57,291 --> 00:38:00,125
Please, Eshe.
I can't lose you.

643
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:02,916
You have my love
always, Mufasa.

644
00:38:03,083 --> 00:38:05,958
But your family is still out
there, waiting for you.

645
00:38:06,125 --> 00:38:07,666
I can feel their presence.

646
00:38:07,833 --> 00:38:09,500
And I know you can, too.

647
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,500
Go.

648
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:15,250
Go, Mufasa.
Find your way home.

649
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,750
Mother, please forgive me.
I beg you.

650
00:38:26,916 --> 00:38:29,125
There's no need, my love.

651
00:38:29,291 --> 00:38:32,166
Taka, your moment of courage
will come.

652
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:42,250
Now both of you go.

653
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:45,250
Go and find your place

654
00:38:45,666 --> 00:38:47,250
in the Circle of Life.

655
00:39:05,083 --> 00:39:08,000
They left their family
never to see them again?

656
00:39:08,166 --> 00:39:09,333
This story is killing me.

657
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,041
It's toying with my emotions.

658
00:39:11,208 --> 00:39:12,666
And here
is the worst part.

659
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:14,541
- What's that?
- I'm out of crickets.

660
00:39:14,708 --> 00:39:15,958
Oh, maybe that's for the best.

661
00:39:16,125 --> 00:39:17,666
I need a bathroom break
before the second act.

662
00:39:17,833 --> 00:39:19,291
Everyone wait for me.

663
00:39:24,541 --> 00:39:25,541
I am back.

664
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:26,915
Pumbaa, did you wash
your hooves?

665
00:39:26,916 --> 00:39:27,999
Mm-hmm.

666
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,250
- Pumbaa?
- I did. I did.

667
00:39:29,416 --> 00:39:30,666
-  Pumbaa?
- I'm just gonna walk

668
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:32,416
- on them again right after.
- Pumbaa?

669
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:37,000
Rafiki,
did the Outsiders come?

670
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,166
Yes.

671
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:41,083
And as the hunters led Kiros
into the Valley of Kings,

672
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:44,625
<i>Obasi and Eshe
stood their ground.</i>

673
00:39:57,250 --> 00:40:00,416
Which one of you is king?

674
00:40:00,583 --> 00:40:03,541
You have no reason
to challenge me.

675
00:40:03,708 --> 00:40:08,208
Does this look
like a challenge, King?

676
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:11,041
There are rules among lions.

677
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:12,375
Not anymore.

678
00:40:13,208 --> 00:40:16,041
While you ruled this pride,
I've built my army.

679
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:18,041
Yours is the last pride

680
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:21,166
in the Valley of Kings,
which means

681
00:40:21,333 --> 00:40:25,208
everything the light touches
belongs to me.

682
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:27,041
There will be one ruler.

683
00:40:27,208 --> 00:40:29,833
One Lion King.

They'll be tracking us.

724
00:42:49,083 --> 00:42:50,583
- Taka!
-  What if you're wrong?

725
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,000
What if they're okay?

726
00:42:52,125 --> 00:42:54,416
They live in you now.

727
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:56,416
Follow me, brother.

728
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:58,458
We have to move...

729
00:42:59,375 --> 00:43:00,583
together.

730
00:43:25,291 --> 00:43:26,791
Run, Mufasa.

731
00:43:27,708 --> 00:43:29,500
Run!

732
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:31,750
Hunters.

733
00:43:31,916 --> 00:43:33,916
-  What's the plan?
-  Uh...

734
00:43:34,291 --> 00:43:36,541
Run! Very fast!

735
00:43:42,083 --> 00:43:43,541
This way!

736
00:43:58,166 --> 00:43:59,416
Back to the trees.

737
00:43:59,583 --> 00:44:01,250
We're trapped.
We have to swim.

738
00:44:01,416 --> 00:44:02,833
No, we have to fight.

739
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:04,458
If we fight, we die.

740
00:44:04,625 --> 00:44:06,000
But if we swim, we drown.

741
00:44:06,166 --> 00:44:08,250
Okay, I didn't
want to do this,

742
00:44:08,416 --> 00:44:10,500
- but I command you to swim!
- You what?

743
00:44:10,666 --> 00:44:13,291
You pledged your loyalty.
I command you to swim.

744
00:44:13,458 --> 00:44:15,958
Taka, this is not the time
for jokes.

745
00:44:30,541 --> 00:44:33,083
Which one of you
killed my son?

746
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:34,832
I did.
This lion with me is nothing

747
00:44:34,833 --> 00:44:36,415
but a stray. Let him go.

748
00:44:36,416 --> 00:44:38,208
Kiros, the other is no stray.

749
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:40,125
He holds the blood
of the pride.

750
00:44:41,666 --> 00:44:44,208
The last blood
of the king? Hmm.

751
00:44:45,458 --> 00:44:48,207
Blood for blood.

752
00:45:04,666 --> 00:45:05,958
They're coming!

753
00:45:06,583 --> 00:45:07,708
What do we do?

754
00:45:07,875 --> 00:45:09,166
We find the advantage?

755
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:10,374
What advantage?

756
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:12,916
We're on a rock
in the middle of the water!

757
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:16,416
Taka, this is it.
We go for the king.

758
00:45:25,916 --> 00:45:27,083
Mufasa, I'm ready.

759
00:45:27,875 --> 00:45:29,416
Just one last thing.

760
00:45:29,583 --> 00:45:30,625
- What?
- Chin up!

761
00:45:31,625 --> 00:45:33,333
Taka!

762
00:45:33,583 --> 00:45:36,249
This was a bad idea.

763
00:45:45,041 --> 00:45:46,374
Mufasa!

764
00:45:46,375 --> 00:45:47,624
Mufasa!

765
00:45:55,208 --> 00:45:56,415
-  Mufasa...
- Yeah!

766
00:45:56,416 --> 00:45:57,499
- We're alive.
- Ah!

767
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:59,791
I did it. I saved us.

768
00:46:02,625 --> 00:46:04,083
You were saying?

769
00:46:32,291 --> 00:46:34,333
Okay. Okay.

770
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,208
No... No more water.

771
00:46:36,375 --> 00:46:38,416
Tell me you can track them
down river.

772
00:46:38,583 --> 00:46:40,833
We can track them anywhere.

773
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,583
They can run,
but they can't hide.

774
00:46:44,958 --> 00:46:47,291
So just to be clear,
we're not in this story?

775
00:46:47,458 --> 00:46:48,749
It feels a little bit like

776
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:50,750
Kiros is stealing
my thunder here.

777
00:46:50,916 --> 00:46:52,916
Yeah. You know,
I don't feel seen.

778
00:46:53,166 --> 00:46:54,707
No. There's a lotta stories
with all of us.

779
00:46:54,708 --> 00:46:55,790
Tell one of those!

780
00:46:55,791 --> 00:46:57,625
Can I make
one small suggestion?

781
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:00,375
Less childhood trauma,
more meerkat.

782
00:47:00,541 --> 00:47:03,250
Rafiki, I know
who Taka's gonna be.

783
00:47:03,416 --> 00:47:06,000
Oh. Me too. It's so obvious.

784
00:47:06,166 --> 00:47:07,833
But maybe, just so we're on
the same page, tell me?

785
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,708
- Is it Simba? Is it me?
- Pumbaa.

786
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:11,666
Oh, wait. Am I Obasi?

787
00:47:11,833 --> 00:47:12,832
That makes no sense.

788
00:47:12,833 --> 00:47:14,041
But seriously,
I have one question.

789
00:47:15,708 --> 00:47:17,125
Am I Taka?

790
00:47:17,541 --> 00:47:20,875
♪ I did
it again, I did it again ♪

791
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:24,915
Not that I'm counting,
but I saved your hide. Again!

792
00:47:24,916 --> 00:47:27,499
As much as
it kills you to say it,

793
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,125
let's hear a little,
"Thank you, Taka."

794
00:47:29,291 --> 00:47:31,415
You want me
to thank you

795
00:47:31,416 --> 00:47:33,083
for pushing me
off a waterfall?

796
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,582
Yes, and you're welcome.

797
00:47:35,583 --> 00:47:36,832
Look, it's not my fault

798
00:47:36,833 --> 00:47:38,249
crocodiles are simply
attracted to you.

799
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:40,499
Don't...
Don't say that.

800
00:47:43,708 --> 00:47:46,708
♪ I did
it again, I did it...

801
00:47:48,125 --> 00:47:49,416
Mufasa.

802
00:47:50,041 --> 00:47:51,833
Is it them?
Is it the Outsiders?

803
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,875
No.
She's right there.

804
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:55,166
"She"?

805
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:59,291
There's no place to run.

806
00:47:59,458 --> 00:48:00,875
We have your scent.

807
00:48:01,166 --> 00:48:02,207
My scent?

808
00:48:02,208 --> 00:48:04,708
I've been stalking
you two all night.

809
00:48:05,166 --> 00:48:06,708
That's not possible.

810
00:48:06,875 --> 00:48:08,333
Then
why did I circle you

811
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:09,750
three times in this wood

812
00:48:09,916 --> 00:48:12,125
while you two were
chasing each other's tails?

813
00:48:31,625 --> 00:48:33,250
Uh... That's embarrassing.

814
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:37,166
Yeah, well, I, uh,
meant to do that, so...

815
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:39,250
Still think I'm afraid?

816
00:48:41,833 --> 00:48:42,999
Why are you
following us?

817
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:44,415
I was hoping to find my pride.

818
00:48:44,416 --> 00:48:45,499
What happened to them?

819
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:46,583
The Outsiders
happened.

820
00:48:47,041 --> 00:48:48,124
A few of us got away,

821
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:50,833
but you're the only
other lions I've seen.

822
00:48:52,083 --> 00:48:53,083
You two better keep moving.

823
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:54,500
Wait! Please.

824
00:48:54,666 --> 00:48:56,916
Um... My name is Taka.

825
00:48:58,083 --> 00:48:59,791
Son of Obasi.

826
00:48:59,958 --> 00:49:01,625
I know what it's like
to lose everything.

827
00:49:01,791 --> 00:49:03,041
Come with us. We can help you.

828
00:49:03,208 --> 00:49:04,791
I don't need any help.

829
00:49:04,958 --> 00:49:07,083
But you don't have anyone.

830
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:09,875
She does indeed have someone.
Thank you very much.

831
00:49:10,041 --> 00:49:12,250
That's Zazu. Don't eat him.

832
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:13,875
You heard her. Do not eat me.

833
00:49:14,041 --> 00:49:16,833
As a recent addition
to the King's Royal Guard,

834
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,791
I must kindly ask you both
to move on.

835
00:49:19,958 --> 00:49:21,708
Thank you for stopping by.

836
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:23,916
Your king hired a bird
to protect you?

837
00:49:24,208 --> 00:49:25,791
How high can you fly?

838
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,625
- Mmm.
- Look, I needed a scout.

839
00:49:28,791 --> 00:49:30,375
Zazu was the last option.

840
00:49:30,541 --> 00:49:32,083
Well, next to last.

841
00:49:32,250 --> 00:49:34,083
Between Albert the Iguana
and I,

842
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:37,833
His Majesty decided
on the underling with wings.

843
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,791
And thus, I became the
lead scout for the princess.

844
00:49:40,958 --> 00:49:42,499
It's my third day,
going swimmingly,

845
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:43,750
if I may say so myself.

846
00:49:43,916 --> 00:49:45,208
Sarabi, you can
say so as well.

847
00:49:45,375 --> 00:49:46,958
How far do you think
you'll get with a bird?

848
00:49:47,125 --> 00:49:49,082
How far do you two geniuses
think you'll get

849
00:49:49,083 --> 00:49:51,000
stumbling around,
running into each other?

850
00:49:51,166 --> 00:49:53,083
All the way to <i>Milele.</i>

851
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:55,041
<i>- Milele</i> is nothing but a myth.
- It's not a myth.

852
00:49:55,208 --> 00:49:57,290
Circle of Life
and fairy tale herds.

853
00:49:57,291 --> 00:49:58,374
- You're chasing something...
- Honestly.

854
00:49:58,375 --> 00:49:59,457
- ...that doesn't exist.
- As If.

855
00:49:59,458 --> 00:50:02,000
I don't know that <i>Milele</i>
exists, but right now,

856
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:03,333
it's the only hope we have.

857
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,333
We don't need hope.
We need food.

858
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:09,957
Um...
Good job, brother.

859
00:50:09,958 --> 00:50:11,915
Oh, real nice.

860
00:50:11,916 --> 00:50:14,333
There's trouble in the trees.
My first real trouble,

861
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:15,999
and I am going to pass.
Not going.

862
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,500
I am staying right here,
thank you.

863
00:50:17,666 --> 00:50:20,875
Come on, Sarabi. Looks like
there's dinner headed our way.

864
00:50:21,416 --> 00:50:23,125
Sarabi, if I may.

865
00:50:23,583 --> 00:50:26,375
He makes a valid point,
Your Highness.

866
00:50:26,666 --> 00:50:28,499
But, on the other hand,
he's a starving lion,

867
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,458
he wants to eat me,
so I am slightly torn.

868
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:35,915
I think that went quite well,
all things considered.

869
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:49,500
<i>And now, Kiara,
this is where I come in.</i>

870
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:59,500
Rafiki.

871
00:51:00,041 --> 00:51:02,708
Order! We will have order
in the Congress of Baboons.

872
00:51:02,875 --> 00:51:04,874
Tonight, a cheetah
came into our trees

873
00:51:04,875 --> 00:51:06,333
for the third night in a row.

874
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:07,833
Almost took one of our own.

875
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,000
It was Rafiki's fault.

876
00:51:09,291 --> 00:51:11,250
He summoned the beast
with his dreams.

877
00:51:11,416 --> 00:51:12,665
Rafiki
and his visions

878
00:51:12,666 --> 00:51:14,791
must be banished
once and for all.

879
00:51:14,958 --> 00:51:16,125
Rafiki tried to warn you.

880
00:51:16,291 --> 00:51:17,957
His dreams
conjure our enemies.

881
00:51:17,958 --> 00:51:20,000
He talks to the spirits,
summons the devil.

882
00:51:20,166 --> 00:51:21,165
What are you talking about?

883
00:51:21,166 --> 00:51:22,291
He's
done it before.

884
00:51:22,458 --> 00:51:24,416
His brother was chased
from these very trees,

885
00:51:24,583 --> 00:51:25,708
never to be seen again.

886
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:27,083
Rafiki was just a child.

887
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,749
A child born with a leg that
does not work.

888
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:30,833
Yet somehow, he survived?

889
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:33,458
It was Rafiki who found water
in the dry season.

890
00:51:33,625 --> 00:51:35,958
Who healed you, Inaki,
when you were sick.

891
00:51:36,125 --> 00:51:39,208
He speaks to the insects,
converses with the moon.

892
00:51:39,375 --> 00:51:40,832
Zala, you know
what will happen

893
00:51:40,833 --> 00:51:42,333
if you send him
down from the trees.

894
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,291
He is <i>amelaaniwa!</i>

895
00:51:44,458 --> 00:51:45,458
A curse to us all.

896
00:51:45,625 --> 00:51:46,624
That's not true.

897
00:51:46,625 --> 00:51:47,707
He doesn't
belong here.

898
00:51:47,708 --> 00:51:50,666
All in favor of banishment,
cover one eye.

899
00:51:51,250 --> 00:51:52,416
How can you
trust him?

900
00:51:52,583 --> 00:51:54,375
Don't trust him,
and I don't trust his magic!

901
00:51:54,541 --> 00:51:55,541
He doesn't
belong here.

902
00:51:55,666 --> 00:51:57,416
He's not a baboon.
And he never will be.

903
00:51:57,583 --> 00:51:59,000
He's not one of us.

904
00:51:59,166 --> 00:52:01,125
And so, it is time.

905
00:52:01,291 --> 00:52:02,583
No, wait.

906
00:52:03,208 --> 00:52:04,625
Where will you go?

907
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:07,208
Where I should have gone
long ago.

908
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:09,416
To find all that was lost.

909
00:52:10,083 --> 00:52:11,166
My family.

910
00:52:11,333 --> 00:52:13,458
You can't survive on your own.

911
00:52:13,625 --> 00:52:14,958
Nobody can.

912
00:52:15,125 --> 00:52:17,500
And yet, here we are.

913
00:52:19,458 --> 00:52:20,750
Oh, Rafiki.

914
00:52:20,916 --> 00:52:25,375
The eye never forgets
what the heart has seen.

915
00:52:45,708 --> 00:52:47,000
It's all right.

916
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,000
Hmm. <i>Jamaa.</i>

917
00:53:15,333 --> 00:53:16,333
Hmm.

918
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:24,083
You can try to run, but I'm
afraid you won't get very far.

919
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:26,041
And why would I run from you?

920
00:53:26,791 --> 00:53:28,750
Because we're lions.

921
00:53:28,916 --> 00:53:31,625
As in... [roaring] lions!

922
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:34,249
A flea
can trouble a lion

923
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:36,125
more than a lion
can trouble a flea.

924
00:53:36,291 --> 00:53:38,958
I don't think you understand
what's about to happen.

925
00:53:39,125 --> 00:53:40,625
There's no place
for you to go.

926
00:53:40,791 --> 00:53:42,583
I am going forward.

927
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:44,166
I seriously doubt that.

928
00:53:44,333 --> 00:53:48,125
It is easy to doubt everything
when you know nothing.

929
00:53:48,291 --> 00:53:50,375
Can we get on
with this, please?

930
00:53:50,541 --> 00:53:53,833
If you take my life,
you will never find <i>Milele.</i>

931
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,750
Wait, did you say <i>Milele?</i>

932
00:53:55,916 --> 00:53:58,750
That is where I'm going.
Toward the light.

933
00:53:58,916 --> 00:54:02,541
I have been there many times
in my dreams.

934
00:54:02,708 --> 00:54:04,708
My brother waits for me there.

935
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:06,208
I've seen the tree.

936
00:54:06,375 --> 00:54:08,375
Can picture it. The two of us,

937
00:54:08,541 --> 00:54:10,041
together again.

938
00:54:10,208 --> 00:54:12,541
And why would anyone trust
a baboon's dream?

939
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:14,958
Sometimes, a dream
is all you have.

940
00:54:15,125 --> 00:54:17,500
The only truth
that lives in you.

941
00:54:17,666 --> 00:54:20,125
Like the memory
of a great king.

942
00:54:20,291 --> 00:54:21,708
How did you know?

943
00:54:21,875 --> 00:54:25,166
Okay. Help us get to <i>Milele,</i>
and we will let you live.

944
00:54:25,333 --> 00:54:26,916
- Do we have a deal?
- No.

945
00:54:27,083 --> 00:54:28,250
What? Why?

946
00:54:28,416 --> 00:54:31,416
Rafiki will let you live.

947
00:54:31,583 --> 00:54:33,708
I've had enough of this!

948
00:54:33,875 --> 00:54:35,541
Taka, do not eat him.

949
00:54:35,708 --> 00:54:37,290
Wonderful.
Another misfit stray

950
00:54:37,291 --> 00:54:38,666
we're not supposed to eat.

951
00:54:38,833 --> 00:54:41,416
So, you expect us
to follow this baboon

952
00:54:41,583 --> 00:54:44,541
to a place nobody
has ever seen?

953
00:54:44,666 --> 00:54:47,166
- I'll be better off alone.
<i>- Hhe ntombazane.</i>

954
00:54:47,333 --> 00:54:49,750
A single stick may smoke,

955
00:54:49,916 --> 00:54:51,791
but it will never burn.

956
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,458
Okay, now that
there's five of us,

957
00:54:56,625 --> 00:54:57,624
why don't we all go around

958
00:54:57,625 --> 00:54:59,208
and say a fun fact
about ourselves?

959
00:54:59,375 --> 00:55:00,375
I'll go first.

960
00:55:00,541 --> 00:55:03,500
I once had
a crush on a flamingo.

961
00:55:03,666 --> 00:55:05,666
I've never
said that out loud.

962
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:07,291
And they're walking away.

963
00:55:07,458 --> 00:55:09,250
Yeah, places to go,
kingdoms to see.

964
00:55:09,416 --> 00:55:10,875
We're busy. Let's hustle.

965
00:55:20,958 --> 00:55:23,416
Wait, wait, wait. Now you're
the star of this thing?

966
00:55:23,583 --> 00:55:26,166
Someone's a little tired
of bein' second banana, huh?

967
00:55:26,333 --> 00:55:28,625
All of a sudden, there's
a lotta Rafiki in this story.

968
00:55:28,791 --> 00:55:30,665
You even gave yourself
a long-lost brother.

969
00:55:30,666 --> 00:55:31,749
- Yeah.
-  What's next?

970
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:32,832
A funny catchphrase?

971
00:55:32,833 --> 00:55:34,791
You gonna be fartin'
next? 'Cause that's my thing.

972
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:37,333
You cannot tell the story
of Mufasa

973
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,958
without the story of Rafiki.

974
00:55:40,125 --> 00:55:41,499
Oh, now he's even
talkin' about himself

975
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:42,582
in the third person.

976
00:55:42,583 --> 00:55:43,916
Pretty soon, he'll have
his own fragrance.

977
00:55:44,083 --> 00:55:46,458
And I'm the only one
with a fragrance around here.

978
00:55:46,625 --> 00:55:48,166
It's called
"Pumbaa by Pumbaa,"

979
00:55:48,333 --> 00:55:50,833
and from what I hear,
it's pretty gross.

980
00:55:51,458 --> 00:55:52,958
Mom? Dad?

981
00:55:53,375 --> 00:55:55,750
If you can hear me, come home.

982
00:55:56,708 --> 00:55:57,875
Please.

983
00:55:58,291 --> 00:55:59,541
Come home.

984
00:56:07,291 --> 00:56:08,291
Mother?

985
00:56:10,666 --> 00:56:11,666
Mother?

986
00:56:15,708 --> 00:56:17,166
<i>Milele.</i>

987
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,332
Mother!

988
00:56:37,208 --> 00:56:38,833
- Rafiki.
-  <i>Ayi suka.</i>

989
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,666
- What are you doing?
- I am fishing.

990
00:56:40,833 --> 00:56:43,291
You're sitting on
a rock with your eyes closed.

991
00:56:43,458 --> 00:56:46,708
My eyes are open.
It is my lids that are closed.

992
00:56:46,875 --> 00:56:49,250
Why am I talking to a baboon?

993
00:56:49,416 --> 00:56:53,166
I am not a baboon.
I am a mandrill.

994
00:56:53,333 --> 00:56:56,041
No offense,
but a monkey is a monkey.

995
00:56:56,208 --> 00:56:57,625
And a stray
is a stray.

996
00:56:57,791 --> 00:56:58,791
What's that supposed to mean?

997
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:01,041
It means
we are very much the same.

998
00:57:01,208 --> 00:57:02,541
<i>Siyafana.</i>

999
00:57:02,708 --> 00:57:04,250
We are nothing alike.

1000
00:57:04,583 --> 00:57:07,750
Take a good look. I am a lion.

1001
00:57:07,916 --> 00:57:09,624
A lion
who fears water,

1002
00:57:09,625 --> 00:57:11,291
fears his own reflection.

1003
00:57:11,791 --> 00:57:13,499
Who can't sleep
because of what he sees

1004
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,250
when he closes his eyes.

1005
00:57:15,416 --> 00:57:16,416
Huh?

1006
00:57:16,583 --> 00:57:19,458
You are afraid
of your dreams, Mufasa.

1007
00:57:19,625 --> 00:57:21,625
Afraid of what
you see in them.

1008
00:57:21,791 --> 00:57:24,208
I see my parents.

1009
00:57:24,916 --> 00:57:26,958
I feel them everywhere.

1010
00:57:27,125 --> 00:57:28,916
Of course
you do, Mufasa.

1011
00:57:29,708 --> 00:57:32,125
You will feel them forever.

1012
00:57:32,541 --> 00:57:35,458
My mother, I hear her voice.

1013
00:57:35,916 --> 00:57:39,625
She tells me that we are
on a journey to <i>Milele,</i>

1014
00:57:39,833 --> 00:57:43,000
but I feel so lost
without her.

1015
00:57:43,166 --> 00:57:46,625
Your journey
is not a dream, Mufasa.

1016
00:57:46,791 --> 00:57:48,583
Your mother is guiding you,

1017
00:57:48,875 --> 00:57:52,250
and where you are going,
a family awaits.

1018
00:57:55,333 --> 00:58:00,249
<i>Ah... Ni heshima
kukutana nawe, binamu.</i>

1019
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:04,208
<i>Nenda kwa amani.
Ah...</i>

1020
00:58:05,083 --> 00:58:06,250
What are you doing?

1021
00:58:06,791 --> 00:58:07,791
We're starving.

1022
00:58:07,916 --> 00:58:09,333
'Twas not its time.

1023
00:58:09,583 --> 00:58:13,208
Instead, the fish has agreed
to let us share the water.

1024
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:22,541
<i>Iketle Rafiki.
Iketle mosimane.</i>

1025
00:58:23,583 --> 00:58:24,708
I have a report.

1026
00:58:25,333 --> 00:58:26,458
It's morning.

1027
00:58:27,166 --> 00:58:28,791
End of report.

1028
00:58:36,541 --> 00:58:39,208
The earth divided
is now a choice.

1029
00:58:39,416 --> 00:58:40,958
Around or down?

1030
00:58:41,125 --> 00:58:43,250
The decision is yours.

1031
00:58:46,125 --> 00:58:47,291
Mmm.

1032
00:58:47,416 --> 00:58:50,208
Look out there,
beyond the light.

1033
00:58:51,208 --> 00:58:53,791
Across the deepest canyon.

1034
00:58:55,166 --> 00:58:57,208
"Across the deepest canyon."

1035
00:58:57,916 --> 00:58:58,916
We should go down.

1036
00:58:59,083 --> 00:59:01,500
Why? Because of some
fairy tale?

1037
00:59:01,666 --> 00:59:03,041
The rocks
will hide our tracks.

1038
00:59:03,208 --> 00:59:04,666
It's safer to go around.

1039
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:06,250
I picked up their scents.

1040
00:59:06,416 --> 00:59:08,916
The only thing you picked up
is a hallucinating baboon.

1041
00:59:09,083 --> 00:59:10,166
I am a mandrill.

1042
00:59:10,333 --> 00:59:11,708
This is a waste of time.

1043
00:59:11,875 --> 00:59:13,291
Close your eyes.

1044
00:59:13,833 --> 00:59:14,833
What?

1045
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,708
Tell me what you see.
What you feel.

1046
00:59:17,875 --> 00:59:19,250
There's nothing on the wind.

1047
00:59:19,416 --> 00:59:20,540
No, they're moving

1048
00:59:20,541 --> 00:59:21,875
- through the bush willow.
- They, who?

1049
00:59:22,041 --> 00:59:24,875
The females, out front.
Come on.

1050
00:59:25,083 --> 00:59:27,125
Clear your thoughts.
Concentrate.

1051
00:59:27,291 --> 00:59:29,333
I am concentrating.

1052
00:59:41,083 --> 00:59:42,250
He's right.

1053
00:59:43,958 --> 00:59:45,291
We have to go down.

1054
00:59:45,583 --> 00:59:47,291
Wow. Wow, wow, wow.

1055
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:49,416
<i>Ah! Uyabona mfana.</i>

1056
00:59:49,625 --> 00:59:52,708
Now the many sticks
will make fire as one.

1057
00:59:53,125 --> 00:59:55,791
Come on. We have places to go.

1058
00:59:55,958 --> 00:59:58,208
And kingdoms to see.

1059
00:59:58,375 --> 01:00:00,290

01:02:47,791 --> 01:02:50,041
Kiros. They are not alone.

1127
01:02:50,208 --> 01:02:51,958
They've collected a lioness.

1128
01:02:52,125 --> 01:02:54,416
And a monkey.

1129
01:03:04,416 --> 01:03:05,541
Mufasa.

1130
01:03:05,708 --> 01:03:07,624
Mufasa.
You have to help me.

1131
01:03:07,625 --> 01:03:08,708
Help you how?

1132
01:03:08,833 --> 01:03:10,166
It's Sarabi, Mufasa.

1133
01:03:10,333 --> 01:03:12,416
She is the light
my mother spoke of.

1134
01:03:12,583 --> 01:03:14,083
- What?
- She's special.

1135
01:03:14,250 --> 01:03:16,750
The most amazing female
I've ever met in my life.

1136
01:03:16,916 --> 01:03:18,165
I don't know
what to say to her.

1137
01:03:18,166 --> 01:03:20,000
You've spent your life
with females.

1138
01:03:20,166 --> 01:03:22,041
Please, tell me what to say.

1139
01:03:22,208 --> 01:03:24,416
Just talk to her. Be yourself.

1140
01:03:24,583 --> 01:03:25,750
No, Mufasa.

1141
01:03:25,916 --> 01:03:26,915
You don't
understand.

1142
01:03:26,916 --> 01:03:28,375
Myself isn't good enough.

1143
01:03:28,875 --> 01:03:29,916
You...

1144
01:03:30,416 --> 01:03:32,250
just know things.

1145
01:03:33,083 --> 01:03:34,708
Fine. Fine.

1146
01:03:35,208 --> 01:03:37,791
Keep it simple.
Ask her a question.

1147
01:03:37,958 --> 01:03:40,750
Right. A question.
This... This is good.

1148
01:03:40,916 --> 01:03:44,541
Yeah, try to be confident.
Disinterested.

1149
01:03:44,708 --> 01:03:46,208
But I'm very interested.

1150
01:03:46,375 --> 01:03:49,625
- Tell her about the flowers.
- What flowers?

1151
01:03:49,791 --> 01:03:53,250
The valley she comes from.
There's flowers everywhere.

1152
01:03:53,416 --> 01:03:55,375
They're called duck flowers.

1153
01:03:55,541 --> 01:03:57,166
Long stems.

1154
01:03:57,333 --> 01:03:59,500
It's absolutely beautiful.

1155
01:04:00,208 --> 01:04:01,208
How do you know that?

1156
01:04:01,375 --> 01:04:04,416
When she passes,
I can smell them on her fur.

1157
01:04:04,875 --> 01:04:05,875
Okay.

1158
01:04:06,333 --> 01:04:08,583
Flowers. Disinterested.

1159
01:04:08,750 --> 01:04:10,082
- Flowers. And disinterested.
- And here's the most

1160
01:04:10,083 --> 01:04:11,500
- important thing, okay?
-  Flowers.

1161
01:04:11,666 --> 01:04:12,833
- And disinterested.
- Listen...

1162
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,665
- Flowers and disinterested.
- ...when she speaks.

1163
01:04:14,666 --> 01:04:15,874
Males have trouble
with that one.

1164
01:04:15,875 --> 01:04:16,957
Flowers...

1165
01:04:16,958 --> 01:04:19,541
Sorry.
What did you say?

1166
01:04:21,125 --> 01:04:22,458
Really?

1167
01:04:23,208 --> 01:04:24,791
I heard you, brother.

1168
01:04:25,416 --> 01:04:27,166
I'm gonna make you proud.

1169
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:40,833
It's very hot,
isn't it?

1170
01:04:41,291 --> 01:04:42,291
Yep.

1171
01:04:43,666 --> 01:04:46,750
I...
I love listening.

1172
01:04:46,916 --> 01:04:48,041
Okay.

1173
01:04:48,208 --> 01:04:50,124
- I'm listening right now.
- To what?

1174
01:04:50,125 --> 01:04:51,207
What you just said.

1175
01:04:51,208 --> 01:04:52,290
You're the one that's talking.

1176
01:04:52,291 --> 01:04:53,375
I am.

1177
01:04:54,666 --> 01:04:56,166
- You smell like a duck.
- What?

1178
01:04:56,333 --> 01:04:57,332
Flower.

1179
01:04:57,333 --> 01:04:59,791
Uh... A duck flower.

1180
01:04:59,958 --> 01:05:02,082
How do you know
about those flowers?

1181
01:05:02,083 --> 01:05:03,374
I, uh...

1182
01:05:03,375 --> 01:05:05,291
Well, I inhaled you
with my nose.

1183
01:05:05,458 --> 01:05:06,958
I can smell them.

1184
01:05:07,125 --> 01:05:09,750
That's amazing.

1185
01:05:09,916 --> 01:05:11,958
Our valley was
full of those flowers,

1186
01:05:12,125 --> 01:05:15,040
thousands of them
as far as the eye could see.

1187
01:05:15,041 --> 01:05:18,375
It was... It was the most
beautiful place, Taka.

1188
01:05:19,041 --> 01:05:21,041
Did he just say
she smells like a duck?

1189
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:23,708
And you call me a baboon?

1190
01:05:38,625 --> 01:05:40,208
They shouldn't be here.

1191
01:05:40,541 --> 01:05:42,041
The migration patterns
are broken.

1192
01:05:42,208 --> 01:05:43,666
- I... I don't understand...
- Outsiders!

1193
01:05:43,833 --> 01:05:46,291
This is not a drill!
Just to be clear,

1194
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:49,291
I never signed up for this.

1195
01:05:51,083 --> 01:05:52,958
It's okay. We're safe.

1196
01:05:53,125 --> 01:05:54,500
They're on the other side.

1197
01:05:55,291 --> 01:05:56,291
Nope!

1198
01:05:56,458 --> 01:05:57,916
They can just jump across!

1199
01:05:58,083 --> 01:05:59,541
We are trapped!

1200
01:05:59,708 --> 01:06:00,833
What do we do?

1201
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,375
The elephants
will fight with us.

1202
01:06:02,541 --> 01:06:03,541
And why would they do that?

1203
01:06:03,708 --> 01:06:06,125
Because I'm going to ask them.

1204
01:06:06,291 --> 01:06:07,666
Got a better idea?

1205
01:06:08,625 --> 01:06:10,666
Yes,
Mr. Ask-Questions-First.

1206
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:11,875
Get ready to run.

1207
01:06:12,416 --> 01:06:13,415
Uh...

1208
01:06:13,416 --> 01:06:14,833
Where is she going?

1209
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,750
Hello? Listen to me, please.
We need your help.

1210
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,290
Can you talk with me?

1211
01:06:19,291 --> 01:06:20,707
We need your help. Please.

1212
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:23,583
They're coming!

1213
01:06:24,416 --> 01:06:26,583
Sarabi! Sarabi, wait!

1214
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:29,250
Sarabi! Sarabi, wait. Wait!
Where is she going?

1215
01:06:31,291 --> 01:06:33,166
She's going for the hive!

1216
01:06:33,333 --> 01:06:36,833
Like I said, get ready to run!

1217
01:06:48,833 --> 01:06:50,041
Run!

1218
01:06:50,208 --> 01:06:52,125
Get to the trees!

1219
01:06:52,291 --> 01:06:56,083
Why am I running?

1220
01:07:23,041 --> 01:07:25,083
Uh, Your Highness,
hold on!

1221
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:27,833
Zazu!

1222
01:07:36,291 --> 01:07:37,749
Sarabi!

1223
01:07:51,250 --> 01:07:53,166
Stand your ground!

1224
01:07:53,333 --> 01:07:54,915
Do not retreat!

1225
01:08:12,791 --> 01:08:14,583
I got you.

1226
01:08:15,208 --> 01:08:16,208
I got you.

1227
01:08:16,791 --> 01:08:19,291
Oh, Sarabi, I got you.

1228
01:08:26,416 --> 01:08:29,415
That's right.
Run along, little kitty cats.

1229
01:08:31,708 --> 01:08:34,208
Thank you, my friend.

1230
01:08:45,083 --> 01:08:47,708
Ah!

1231
01:08:52,041 --> 01:08:53,333
Over here.

1232
01:08:59,625 --> 01:09:01,250
Ah...

1233
01:09:02,750 --> 01:09:04,208
Mmm...

1234
01:09:06,083 --> 01:09:10,666
<i>Vuta Pumzi.</i> Sarabi.

1235
01:09:15,625 --> 01:09:19,041
Alive. She's alive!

1236
01:09:24,458 --> 01:09:26,000
Why are you all looking at me?

1237
01:09:26,166 --> 01:09:28,333
You were thrown from the tree.

1238
01:09:28,500 --> 01:09:30,666
He saved your life.

1239
01:09:31,708 --> 01:09:33,750
- Who?
- Taka.

1240
01:09:33,875 --> 01:09:36,333
-  Uh...
- Taka saved you.

1241
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,375
Isn't that right, brother?

1242
01:09:41,916 --> 01:09:43,415
You saved me?

1243
01:09:43,416 --> 01:09:46,750
Uh... Well, I...
I had to do something.

1244
01:09:46,916 --> 01:09:48,083
Thank you.

1245
01:09:49,458 --> 01:09:50,708
We're lucky.

1246
01:09:50,875 --> 01:09:53,125
Those bees
almost killed us all.

1247
01:09:53,291 --> 01:09:54,875
Those bees saved our lives.

1248
01:09:55,041 --> 01:09:56,458
- Oh, Mufasa.
-  Really?

1249
01:09:56,625 --> 01:09:59,291
Because, uh, it felt like
an elephant stampede.

1250
01:09:59,458 --> 01:10:00,540
We're alive, aren't we?

1251
01:10:00,541 --> 01:10:01,708
The elephants
would have fought with us.

1252
01:10:01,875 --> 01:10:02,916
We're lions.

1253
01:10:03,083 --> 01:10:04,333
Nobody will fight with us.

1254
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:05,666

Rafiki, who...

1264
01:10:39,583 --> 01:10:41,875
Who are the Outsiders?

1265
01:10:42,041 --> 01:10:45,166
Well, the Outsiders come
from many prides.

1266
01:10:45,375 --> 01:10:47,957
But, when they are born,
they are hated

1267
01:10:47,958 --> 01:10:50,833
because they are different
from their tribe.

1268
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,375
Like you and your tribe?

1269
01:10:52,541 --> 01:10:54,125
Yes, just like me.

1270
01:10:54,291 --> 01:10:56,458
- But, Rafiki?
- Yes?

1271
01:10:56,625 --> 01:10:58,541
Why do they wanna
hurt everybody?

1272
01:10:58,875 --> 01:11:02,666
Sometimes, when the people
most like you don't love you,

1273
01:11:02,833 --> 01:11:06,041
it is a hurt that can cause
the greatest pain.

1274
01:11:06,375 --> 01:11:07,708
And this pain

1275
01:11:07,875 --> 01:11:11,250
can lead you
to hate everything.

1276
01:11:11,416 --> 01:11:14,000
I'm glad that didn't happen
to you, Rafiki.

1277
01:11:14,166 --> 01:11:16,708
Yes, my child. I'm glad too.

1278
01:11:18,208 --> 01:11:19,333
Um, hi. We're here, too.

1279
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:21,250
Yeah, why are you leavin' us
outside this story

1280
01:11:21,416 --> 01:11:24,040
when I'm pretty sure
we are the ultimate outsiders.

1281
01:11:24,041 --> 01:11:25,124
- Come on!
-  Yeah,

1282
01:11:25,125 --> 01:11:26,250
we've always
been misunderstood.

1283
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:27,833
I contain multitudes.

1284
01:11:33,625 --> 01:11:36,250
There are many ways to <i>Milele.</i>

1285
01:11:37,125 --> 01:11:39,332
But this will be ours.

1286
01:11:47,541 --> 01:11:50,166
<i>Go. Go, Mufasa.</i>

1287
01:11:50,583 --> 01:11:52,416
<i>Find your forever.</i>

1288
01:11:53,666 --> 01:11:55,375

1289
01:11:55,541 --> 01:11:57,708
Oh, Sarabi, I got you.

1290
01:12:01,166 --> 01:12:02,541
Mmm.

1291
01:12:03,208 --> 01:12:08,208
<i>Iketle Rafiki.

1292
01:12:09,541 --> 01:12:10,875

1293
01:12:17,666 --> 01:12:19,083
Hey, Rafiki?

1294
01:12:19,833 --> 01:12:21,000
What are you doing?

1295
01:12:21,166 --> 01:12:24,625
I am confirming
my vision, Mufasa.

1296
01:12:26,625 --> 01:12:29,665
Can I ask you
something, Rafiki?

1297
01:12:29,666 --> 01:12:30,749
Hmm?

1298
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:33,125
How many of your visions
have come true?

1299
01:12:33,666 --> 01:12:36,166
- So far, none.
- None?

1300
01:12:36,333 --> 01:12:39,416
But it's not what I see.
It's what I feel.

1301
01:12:39,708 --> 01:12:41,291
But how do you...

1302
01:12:41,791 --> 01:12:44,416
How do you know when
you should follow a feeling?

1303
01:12:44,875 --> 01:12:46,750
<i>Milele</i> exists.

1304
01:12:47,125 --> 01:12:49,583
I feel it in here.

1305
01:12:49,916 --> 01:12:51,250
The question is,

1306
01:12:51,416 --> 01:12:53,791
what do you feel, Mufasa,

1307
01:12:55,000 --> 01:12:56,416
in there?

1308
01:13:15,958 --> 01:13:17,000
The weather's shifted.

1309
01:13:17,166 --> 01:13:18,833
There's not enough fresh snow.

1310
01:13:19,291 --> 01:13:21,415
Hey, if the Outsiders
find our tracks,

1311
01:13:21,416 --> 01:13:23,458
they'll follow them to <i>Milele.</i>

1312
01:13:23,625 --> 01:13:26,165
Zazu, only you can
help us now.

1313
01:13:26,166 --> 01:13:28,125
Oh. Are you quite sure
about that?

1314
01:13:28,291 --> 01:13:29,333
No, I was actually thinking

1315
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:31,083
that Rafiki looks pretty
handy, and with the stick...

1316
01:13:31,375 --> 01:13:32,625
Zazu, you can use your wings

1317
01:13:32,791 --> 01:13:34,458
to cover our tracks
as we head up the mountain

1318
01:13:34,625 --> 01:13:36,000
without leaving a trace.

1319
01:13:36,166 --> 01:13:38,082
Hey, you can do this.

1320
01:13:38,083 --> 01:13:40,083
Oh, hmm. Yeah.

1321
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:42,375
Yes, sir. You're right.
I've got this.

1322
01:13:46,083 --> 01:13:48,458
Okay. It's just me against
a frozen mountain.

1323
01:13:48,625 --> 01:13:51,290
You know, one hornbill charged
with saving the future...

1324
01:13:51,291 --> 01:13:53,208
Whoa! Mummy!

1325
01:13:54,291 --> 01:13:57,375
Oh, man alive,
that's cold.

1326
01:14:10,958 --> 01:14:12,916
Now what's happening?

1327
01:14:13,083 --> 01:14:15,125
We can't keep stopping.

1328
01:14:15,291 --> 01:14:17,666
Somehow, they have
covered their tracks.

1329
01:14:17,833 --> 01:14:19,250
In the snow?

1330
01:14:19,833 --> 01:14:21,041
It's not possible.

1331
01:14:21,208 --> 01:14:23,375
Majesty, they could be
anywhere on this mountain...

1332
01:14:23,541 --> 01:14:24,583
Then find them!

1333
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:25,791
Now.

The Outsiders
are completely lost.

1338

Well played, Mufasa.

1339

Great job, Zazu.

1340
01:14:41,916 --> 01:14:42,916
And as per usual.

1341
01:14:43,083 --> 01:14:44,333
I knew
you could do it.

1342
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:46,750

1343
01:14:47,166 --> 01:14:49,291
No, you did it.

1344
01:14:49,458 --> 01:14:51,208
Great thinking, Mufasa.

1345
01:14:51,375 --> 01:14:52,707
Oh, we're all
rubbing off on each other.

1346
01:14:52,708 --> 01:14:53,916
Perfectly normal thing to do.

1347
01:14:54,083 --> 01:14:55,791
Who wants to rub against Zazu?

1348
01:14:55,958 --> 01:14:57,500
No one. I'm leaving now.

1349
01:14:57,666 --> 01:14:59,500
I'll scout ahead.

1350
01:15:07,166 --> 01:15:09,750
Ah.

1351
01:15:13,833 --> 01:15:15,333
I got you, Rafiki.

1352
01:15:15,500 --> 01:15:16,708
- Hey.
- I got you.

1353
01:15:17,125 --> 01:15:18,125
<i>Ho monate,</i> Mufasa.

1354
01:15:18,291 --> 01:15:19,500
Yeah, I got you.

1355
01:15:23,083 --> 01:15:25,583
Mufasa...

1356
01:15:27,041 --> 01:15:28,416
"I got you."

1357
01:15:41,291 --> 01:15:45,291
Hidden in the shadows,
downwind, light of foot.

1358
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:47,958
Interesting hunting style,
Mufasa.

1359
01:15:48,125 --> 01:15:49,624
We have to eat something

1360
01:15:49,625 --> 01:15:51,375
before we take on
that descent.

1361
01:15:51,541 --> 01:15:53,666
Unfortunately, there's
nothing to hunt up here.

1362
01:15:53,833 --> 01:15:55,000
See under that rock?

1363
01:15:55,166 --> 01:15:57,624
There's a civet
about to leave his den.

1364
01:15:57,625 --> 01:15:59,415
Of course
you can smell

1365
01:15:59,416 --> 01:16:00,791
a civet hidden in the snow.

1366
01:16:00,958 --> 01:16:04,040
You, the lion
who can do anything.

1367
01:16:04,041 --> 01:16:05,958
What's that
supposed to mean?

1368
01:16:06,125 --> 01:16:08,750
It means I see you, Mufasa.

1369
01:16:09,208 --> 01:16:10,833
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1370
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,333
Now, that part, I believe.

1371
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:14,625
Because, smart as you are,

1372
01:16:15,125 --> 01:16:17,583
you have a way of seeing
everything but yourself.

1373
01:16:17,958 --> 01:16:19,125
What is this?

1374
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:20,958
What is this, Sarabi?

1375
01:16:21,125 --> 01:16:22,790
There is a civet in the snow

1376
01:16:22,791 --> 01:16:24,416
right where you said
it would be.

1377
01:16:24,583 --> 01:16:26,500
And you smelled the Outsiders
on the wind,

1378
01:16:26,666 --> 01:16:28,958
which means you're the one who
smelled the flowers on my fur.

1379
01:16:29,125 --> 01:16:30,125
It was a lucky guess.

1380
01:16:30,291 --> 01:16:32,500
You can smell the exact flower
from my valley.

1381
01:16:32,666 --> 01:16:34,541
No,
that's not possible.

1382
01:16:34,708 --> 01:16:36,083
You saved me.

1383
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:38,708
Held me, covered me in the
stampede, comforted me.

1384
01:16:38,875 --> 01:16:39,875
No, it was Taka.

1385
01:16:40,041 --> 01:16:42,000
"I got you.
I got you, Sarabi."

1386
01:16:42,166 --> 01:16:44,291
- I'm here to protect him.
- That was you.

1387
01:16:44,458 --> 01:16:46,457
I was lost in the water,
and he found me.

1388
01:16:46,458 --> 01:16:47,541
My brother saved me.

1389
01:16:47,708 --> 01:16:49,208
Ah, I sensed it
from the beginning.

1390
01:16:49,375 --> 01:16:51,332
His blood is the blood
of the king.

1391
01:16:51,333 --> 01:16:52,415
Mufasa.

1392
01:16:52,416 --> 01:16:54,333
- That is his destiny.
- No!

1393
01:16:54,666 --> 01:16:56,708
His destiny was to save you.

1394
01:17:00,375 --> 01:17:02,249

1472
01:22:07,375 --> 01:22:10,500
There wasn't much
to eat on this mountain

1473
01:22:10,791 --> 01:22:12,166
until now.

1474
01:22:13,291 --> 01:22:16,666
Tell me, how did you cover
your tracks in the snow?

1475
01:22:16,833 --> 01:22:18,291
A bird helped us.

1476
01:22:18,458 --> 01:22:21,208
Lions getting help
from a bird?

1477
01:22:21,375 --> 01:22:24,083
Just as I will help you.

1478
01:22:24,250 --> 01:22:25,833
You will help us?

1479
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:28,833
You think we need help
from a wounded coward?

1480
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:32,375
I may hold the blood
of a king,

1481
01:22:33,125 --> 01:22:38,416
but it was Mufasa
who killed your son.

1482
01:22:38,916 --> 01:22:41,000
It was Mufasa

1483
01:22:41,166 --> 01:22:43,083
who trapped you up here,

1484
01:22:43,250 --> 01:22:46,125
outsmarted you at every turn.

1485
01:22:46,583 --> 01:22:50,333
Now I will lead you to him
and to <i>Milele.</i>

1486
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:52,541
<i>Milele!</i>

1487
01:22:52,708 --> 01:22:57,291
<i>Milele</i> is nothing but a dream,
a vision sold to cubs.

1488
01:22:57,500 --> 01:23:00,375
Ah. Well,
tell that to the monkey.

1489
01:23:00,541 --> 01:23:02,125
He leads them to it.

1490
01:23:02,583 --> 01:23:03,708
Look at you.

1491
01:23:04,083 --> 01:23:07,083
A pack of starving wolves

1492
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:09,375
clinging to the side
of a mountain.

1493
01:23:09,541 --> 01:23:11,166
No tracks to follow.

1494
01:23:11,333 --> 01:23:15,875
Only one chance at revenge.

1495
01:23:17,041 --> 01:23:18,041
Me!

1496
01:23:19,666 --> 01:23:20,833
Revenge...

1497
01:23:22,916 --> 01:23:24,875
What about your father?

1498
01:23:25,833 --> 01:23:27,500
Because of Mufasa,

1499
01:23:28,208 --> 01:23:29,916
I have no father.

1500
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:32,791
He did this.

1501
01:23:35,166 --> 01:23:36,291
Yes.

1502
01:23:36,458 --> 01:23:38,083
You lost a father,

1503
01:23:38,958 --> 01:23:40,583
and I, a son.

1504
01:23:41,125 --> 01:23:43,666
Taka, will you join us?

1505
01:23:45,166 --> 01:23:48,416
Together, we can both
have our revenge.

1506
01:23:51,208 --> 01:23:52,958
It will be my pleasure...

1507
01:23:55,291 --> 01:23:56,375
King.

1508
01:24:20,416 --> 01:24:21,416
Taka!

1509
01:24:22,708 --> 01:24:24,083
Taka, where have you been?

1510
01:24:25,291 --> 01:24:26,291
Hunting.

1511
01:24:26,750 --> 01:24:28,166
I couldn't find anything,

1512
01:24:28,625 --> 01:24:30,458
but I was never
as good as you.

1513
01:24:31,291 --> 01:24:32,666
Or my mother.

1514
01:24:35,083 --> 01:24:36,124
There's something I need
to tell you.

1515
01:24:36,125 --> 01:24:37,208
No.

1516
01:24:37,750 --> 01:24:40,083
There's something
I need to tell you.

1517
01:24:40,666 --> 01:24:42,375
I need to thank you.

1518
01:24:42,541 --> 01:24:45,458
You kept your word
to Eshe and Obasi.

1519
01:24:45,625 --> 01:24:47,708
- Taka...
- You saved me, Mufasa.

1520
01:24:48,375 --> 01:24:49,541
And I...

1521
01:24:50,375 --> 01:24:54,875
will never forget
what you've done, my brother.

1522
01:24:57,291 --> 01:25:00,290
Oh, guys!
I have found a way down

1523
01:25:00,291 --> 01:25:02,125
just beyond those near peaks.

1524
01:25:03,583 --> 01:25:05,000
Was it something I said?

1525
01:25:15,833 --> 01:25:16,833
Hey, Rafiki?

1526
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:18,708
Yes.

1527
01:25:18,875 --> 01:25:21,375
We are nearing
destiny, Mufasa.

1528
01:25:21,541 --> 01:25:24,250
And so, the earth must shake.

1529
01:25:43,083 --> 01:25:46,374
Okay, now I am
100 million percent sure

1530
01:25:46,375 --> 01:25:47,457
who Taka is.

1531
01:25:47,458 --> 01:25:48,541
Just be honest. Is it me?

1532
01:25:48,666 --> 01:25:51,125
In case you missed it,
we're not featured in this.

1533
01:25:51,291 --> 01:25:52,750
I think the civet has more
screen time.

1534
01:25:52,916 --> 01:25:54,332
Hey, maybe they'll put us
in the play.

1535
01:25:54,333 --> 01:25:55,875
No, no, please don't
mention the play again.

1536
01:25:56,041 --> 01:25:57,624
I went to see it.
I'm nothing

1537
01:25:57,625 --> 01:25:58,750
but a giant sock puppet.

1538
01:25:58,916 --> 01:26:00,208
You went to see it?
You didn't bring me?

1539
01:26:00,375 --> 01:26:03,250
Rafiki, Mufasa and Sarabi
are in love?

1540
01:26:03,416 --> 01:26:05,208
Love?

1541
01:26:05,375 --> 01:26:06,665
That sounds gross
and not something like

1542
01:26:06,666 --> 01:26:08,541
I constantly
think about and really want.

1543
01:26:08,708 --> 01:26:10,250
What is Taka gonna do to them?

1544
01:26:10,416 --> 01:26:13,666
Little one,
Taka's heart was broken.

1545
01:26:13,833 --> 01:26:16,708
And now his trap was set.

1546
01:26:32,541 --> 01:26:34,541
Mufasa. Do you see?

1547
01:26:34,916 --> 01:26:36,458
I don't believe it.

1548
01:26:37,125 --> 01:26:38,708
The other side
of the light.

1549
01:26:39,375 --> 01:26:40,375
Home.

1550
01:26:41,208 --> 01:26:43,041
<i>Milele.</i>

1551
01:27:33,541 --> 01:27:34,541
I can't believe it.

1552
01:27:35,458 --> 01:27:38,958
We found it. We found <i>Milele.</i>

1553
01:27:39,125 --> 01:27:40,125
Yes.

1554
01:27:40,916 --> 01:27:45,416
You found it, brother.
You always do.

1555
01:28:25,250 --> 01:28:26,291
Rafiki.

1556
01:28:28,208 --> 01:28:30,958
This is the tree
from your visions.

1557
01:28:33,041 --> 01:28:35,375
I have seen this tree
many times,

1558
01:28:35,583 --> 01:28:38,833
and, in each vision,
there was always a brother

1559
01:28:39,333 --> 01:28:40,958
standing right here.

1560
01:28:41,125 --> 01:28:42,666
But there's
no one here, Rafiki,

1561
01:28:42,833 --> 01:28:45,625
and you came here
to find your twin.

1562
01:28:46,333 --> 01:28:48,708
He was taken from me long ago.

1563
01:28:48,875 --> 01:28:51,875
What I saw in my dreams
was a brother.

1564
01:28:52,208 --> 01:28:54,083
Standing right here.

1565
01:28:54,250 --> 01:28:56,958
A friend, family.

1566
01:28:57,125 --> 01:28:58,833
What I saw was you.

1567
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:00,500
The unseeable.

1568
01:29:00,666 --> 01:29:03,125
I saw Mufasa.

1569
01:29:03,291 --> 01:29:04,291
Me?

1570
01:29:04,458 --> 01:29:06,291
Yes, you.

1571
01:29:06,458 --> 01:29:08,041
My brother.

1572
01:29:14,125 --> 01:29:15,166
Mufasa.

1573
01:29:15,333 --> 01:29:16,750
How do you know who I am?

1574
01:29:16,916 --> 01:29:18,707
We know the Outsiders
are hunting you,

1575
01:29:18,708 --> 01:29:20,708
and we fear
you'll bring danger.

1576
01:29:20,875 --> 01:29:22,875
No. No. We covered our tracks.

1577
01:29:23,250 --> 01:29:25,250
I promise you
<i>Milele</i> is a safe place,

1578
01:29:25,416 --> 01:29:28,040
and I would never do anything
to jeopardize that.

1579
01:29:31,125 --> 01:29:34,000
Do not run.

1580
01:29:34,166 --> 01:29:36,208
You have nothing to fear.

1581
01:29:36,375 --> 01:29:38,166
We are not here for you.

1582
01:29:38,625 --> 01:29:41,708
We have come for Mufasa.

1583
01:29:41,875 --> 01:29:44,166
Oh, no, no.
How did they get here?

1584
01:29:45,166 --> 01:29:47,416
Do not let him divide us.

1585
01:29:52,875 --> 01:29:56,000
It's no use, Mufasa.
The Circle...

1586
01:29:57,708 --> 01:29:59,833
The Circle is broken.

1587
01:30:00,125 --> 01:30:01,124
No!

1588
01:30:01,125 --> 01:30:02,666
Mufasa, what are you doing?

1589
01:30:02,833 --> 01:30:04,999
I'm going to fight,
and I'm going to show them

1590
01:30:05,000 --> 01:30:06,166
that they can fight, too.

1591
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:08,707
Rafiki, when you hear
my signal,

1592
01:30:08,708 --> 01:30:09,791
help me call them together.

1593
01:30:09,916 --> 01:30:11,208
Yes, my brother.

1594
01:30:13,041 --> 01:30:15,041
There are
other lions here.

1595
01:30:15,208 --> 01:30:16,333
Find them.

1596
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:18,583
With pleasure, Your Majesty.

1597
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,666
Mufasa, you're not alone.

1598
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:24,291
It's my turn to go
ask questions first.

1599
01:30:37,958 --> 01:30:41,541
This is where the hunt ends,
Mufasa.

1600
01:30:42,541 --> 01:30:44,125
Thanks to your brother.

1601
01:30:44,291 --> 01:30:46,666
He left a trail of scars
for us to follow.

1602
01:30:46,833 --> 01:30:48,875
He made a deal
to save himself.

1603
01:30:49,041 --> 01:30:51,791
- Gave us this kingdom.
- Tell me he's lying.

1604
01:30:51,958 --> 01:30:53,500
Asked us to kill the stray.

1605
01:30:53,666 --> 01:30:54,833
Taka, please!

1606
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,041
I'm the son of a king.

1607
01:30:57,625 --> 01:30:59,625
But Sarabi chose you.

1608
01:30:59,791 --> 01:31:01,166
Just like Mother.

1609
01:31:01,333 --> 01:31:03,583
Just like my own father.

1610
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:06,958
I saved you
and you betrayed me!

1611
01:31:07,125 --> 01:31:08,583
What have you done?

1612
01:31:08,750 --> 01:31:10,416
I'm your brother,
fight with me!

1613
01:31:10,583 --> 01:31:13,208
You stole my destiny.

1614
01:31:13,375 --> 01:31:15,000
Now this is yours.

1615
01:31:16,791 --> 01:31:18,666
He's one of us now.

1616
01:31:19,208 --> 01:31:21,000
My son's name...

1617
01:31:21,916 --> 01:31:23,291
was Shaju.

1618
01:31:24,291 --> 01:31:25,833
Shaju!

1619
01:31:26,375 --> 01:31:28,416
All of this
should have been his.

1620
01:31:28,583 --> 01:31:33,083
And now I will rule it
without mercy.

1621
01:31:39,541 --> 01:31:41,833
This one is mine.

1622
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:30,875
Please. We can't wage
this battle alone.

1623
01:32:31,041 --> 01:32:32,291
There's nothing we can do.

1624
01:32:32,458 --> 01:32:34,625
They've chased us
from our pride lands before.

1625
01:32:34,791 --> 01:32:36,708
- They're too strong.
- Fight with us.

1626
01:32:36,875 --> 01:32:39,375
Fight for your young.
For your future.

1627
01:32:39,541 --> 01:32:42,166
What future?
They've taken all we have.

1628
01:32:42,333 --> 01:32:44,375
And they will always
take more.

1629
01:33:09,333 --> 01:33:12,125
I am Mufasa,
a stray with no pride,

1630
01:33:12,291 --> 01:33:14,125
and yet I stand before you.

1631
01:33:14,291 --> 01:33:15,333
Head unbowed.

1632
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:17,708
I know you're afraid,
but trust me.

1633
01:33:17,875 --> 01:33:20,332
Nothing will change
if we remain isolated

1634
01:33:20,333 --> 01:33:21,875
to our own tribes

1635
01:33:22,041 --> 01:33:24,666
without concern
for the fate of others.

1636
01:33:24,833 --> 01:33:26,625
But why should
we stand with you?

1637
01:33:26,791 --> 01:33:28,541
This is your fight.

1638
01:33:28,833 --> 01:33:31,625
Today, they are here for us
lions, but I assure you,

1639
01:33:31,791 --> 01:33:34,708
as you let them walk among you
in search of us now,

1640
01:33:34,875 --> 01:33:37,583
they are plotting to come
for you tomorrow.

1641
01:33:37,750 --> 01:33:40,791
One lion's hope cannot change
the fate of <i>Milele.</i>

1642
01:33:40,958 --> 01:33:43,457
There is no lion as large
as an elephant,

1643
01:33:43,458 --> 01:33:44,916
as strong as an oxen,

1644
01:33:45,083 --> 01:33:47,541
fast as a cheetah
or tall as a giraffe,

1645
01:33:47,708 --> 01:33:50,125
who can soar and scout
as wide and far

1646
01:33:50,291 --> 01:33:52,208
as the cranes
and hawks in the sky.

1647
01:33:52,416 --> 01:33:54,416
So, can't you see...

1648
01:33:54,750 --> 01:33:57,416
Every being has a place
in the Circle of Life.

1649
01:33:57,583 --> 01:33:59,375
My breath is your breath.

1650
01:33:59,541 --> 01:34:01,500
Your fight is my fight.

1651
01:34:01,666 --> 01:34:05,041
I will not bend to evil,
and neither should you.

1652
01:34:05,291 --> 01:34:07,541
<i>Nants ingonyama bagithi!</i>

1653
01:34:08,666 --> 01:34:11,208
<i>Nants ingonyama bagithi!</i>

1654
01:34:11,375 --> 01:34:14,416
<i>Nants ingonyama bagithi!</i>

1655
01:34:14,541 --> 01:34:16,208
Mufasa is right.

1656
01:34:16,500 --> 01:34:18,041
<i>Milele</i> is home.

1657
01:34:18,583 --> 01:34:22,332
We must stand with Mufasa!

1658
01:34:22,333 --> 01:34:25,000
<i>Nants
ingonyama bagithi!</i>

1659
01:34:25,625 --> 01:34:29,290
Together we shall stand strong
for <i>Milele!</i>

1660
01:34:30,375 --> 01:34:32,165
<i>Nants
ingonyama bagithi!</i>

1661
01:34:32,166 --> 01:34:34,790
<i>Nants ingonyama bagithi!</i>

1662
01:34:36,666 --> 01:34:38,833
Here comes the lion!

1663
01:34:47,375 --> 01:34:49,541
From this moment on,

1664
01:34:49,708 --> 01:34:54,333
everything the light touches
belongs to me.

1665
01:34:54,583 --> 01:34:55,958
You'll have to take it.

1666
01:35:21,625 --> 01:35:22,875
Bye-bye.

1667
01:35:28,750 --> 01:35:32,499
You've messed
with the wrong hornbill!

1668
01:35:34,833 --> 01:35:36,875
Lunch is served.

1669
01:35:37,333 --> 01:35:40,708
Stand down! I am highly
trained and occasionally a...

1670
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:45,125
This is so embarrassing.

1671
01:35:46,500 --> 01:35:49,500
I do have wings, you know.

1672
01:36:07,083 --> 01:36:08,291
Taka!

1673
01:36:09,375 --> 01:36:12,207
Taka, please. Please!

1674
01:36:16,416 --> 01:36:18,583
Mufasa.

1675
01:36:18,750 --> 01:36:20,958
Mufasa.

1676
01:37:16,875 --> 01:37:18,708
You dare

1677
01:37:18,916 --> 01:37:21,791
to challenge me?

1678
01:37:22,833 --> 01:37:25,166
You took my son.

1679
01:37:25,833 --> 01:37:27,791
<i>My future.</i>

1680
01:37:28,375 --> 01:37:32,291
<i>Taka... Taka, your
moment of courage will come.</i>

1681
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:38,833
Blood for blood.

1682
01:37:47,166 --> 01:37:49,416
Please. Don't kill him.

1683
01:37:49,583 --> 01:37:51,250
I didn't kill him.

1684
01:37:51,416 --> 01:37:52,750
You did.

1685
01:38:21,916 --> 01:38:23,458
They're coming.

1686
01:38:26,041 --> 01:38:28,166
The last lions.

1687
01:38:28,333 --> 01:38:30,041
Time for their extinction,

1688
01:38:30,208 --> 01:38:32,458
and we'll start
with the youngest.

1689
01:38:42,416 --> 01:38:45,083
The earth will shake.

1690
01:38:48,708 --> 01:38:50,541
Attack!

1691
01:39:24,041 --> 01:39:25,625
Mufasa.

1692
01:39:57,625 --> 01:39:59,250
<i>Close your eyes</i>

1693
01:39:59,416 --> 01:40:01,625
<i>and tell me what you hear.</i>

1694
01:40:01,791 --> 01:40:03,791
<i>What you feel.</i>

1695
01:41:28,041 --> 01:41:30,041
Mufasa!

1696
01:42:08,333 --> 01:42:10,333
He defeated the Outsiders.

1697
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:11,874
The king of <i>Milele!</i>

1698
01:42:11,875 --> 01:42:13,207
The king of <i>Milele!</i>

1699
01:42:17,375 --> 01:42:19,625
Is that him?
Our king?

1700
01:42:26,291 --> 01:42:27,375
Your Highness.

1701
01:42:28,875 --> 01:42:29,874
The King of <i>Milele.</i>

1702
01:42:29,875 --> 01:42:31,083
The King of <i>Milele.</i>

1703
01:42:31,875 --> 01:42:33,166
The King of <i>Milele.</i>

1704
01:42:38,875 --> 01:42:40,375
- My king.
- Your Highness.

1705
01:42:40,541 --> 01:42:42,166
- Your Majesty.
- My king.

1706
01:42:42,333 --> 01:42:43,500
Defeated Kiros!

1707
01:42:46,916 --> 01:42:48,875
- My king.
- King?

1708
01:42:49,041 --> 01:42:51,750
No, no, I'm not king.

1709
01:42:51,916 --> 01:42:53,041
Raise your heads.

1710
01:42:53,208 --> 01:42:55,833
No. I'm just... No, no!
No more kings.

1711
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,333
We are all one. Please.

1712
01:42:58,500 --> 01:43:00,625
Please. Raise your heads.

1713
01:43:00,875 --> 01:43:02,833
But, Mufasa,

1714
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:04,958
you have
brought them together.

1715
01:43:05,458 --> 01:43:07,457
You helped them see
in themselves

1716
01:43:07,458 --> 01:43:09,500
what they considered
unseeable.

1717
01:43:10,166 --> 01:43:12,625
Nothing is more kingly.

1718
01:43:12,833 --> 01:43:14,875
No, Rafiki.

1719
01:43:15,041 --> 01:43:18,125
I'm not king.
I'm not royal blood.

1720
01:43:18,291 --> 01:43:20,083
Don't you see, my brother?

1721
01:43:20,541 --> 01:43:23,000
It is not what you were,

1722
01:43:23,208 --> 01:43:27,416
it is what you have become.

1723
01:43:28,250 --> 01:43:31,041
The King of <i>Milele.</i>

1724
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:39,375
My brother,

1725
01:43:39,833 --> 01:43:42,791
something beautiful
awaits you.

1726
01:43:55,250 --> 01:43:56,458
Is this real?

1727
01:43:59,916 --> 01:44:01,125
But it can't be.

1728
01:44:03,833 --> 01:44:05,250
It can't be.

1729
01:44:26,250 --> 01:44:28,625
Oh, Mufasa.

1730
01:44:29,375 --> 01:44:31,041
But how can it be?

1731
01:44:31,500 --> 01:44:34,916
I had a son named Mufasa.

1732
01:44:35,125 --> 01:44:37,916
Taken from me
by a great flood.

1733
01:44:38,416 --> 01:44:39,416
Mother?

1734
01:44:41,125 --> 01:44:43,250
I never stopped hoping.

1735
01:44:43,416 --> 01:44:45,166
Believing.

1736
01:44:45,333 --> 01:44:47,000
My son.

1737
01:44:49,750 --> 01:44:51,541
I've dreamt of this moment.

1738
01:44:54,291 --> 01:44:56,000
And now it's come true.

1739
01:44:56,208 --> 01:44:57,958
Oh, Mufasa.

1740
01:45:03,083 --> 01:45:04,375
But Father?

1741
01:45:06,375 --> 01:45:07,499
Where's Father?

1742
01:45:14,083 --> 01:45:16,041
He lives in you now.

1743
01:45:16,958 --> 01:45:19,916
He lives in you.

1744
01:45:26,541 --> 01:45:28,916
I always dreamed
we'd be together again.

1745
01:45:30,166 --> 01:45:34,125
And I knew it would be
in <i>Milele.</i>

1746
01:45:36,166 --> 01:45:37,291
My son.

1747
01:45:38,458 --> 01:45:39,666
Mufasa.

1748
01:45:46,625 --> 01:45:49,750
Mufasa, please forgive me.

1749
01:45:50,541 --> 01:45:53,333
You must banish him, Sire.

1750
01:45:55,166 --> 01:45:57,041
As long as I am king,

1751
01:45:57,208 --> 01:45:59,666
my brother will have
a place here.

1752
01:46:01,416 --> 01:46:03,916
Brother, I am so...

1753
01:46:04,083 --> 01:46:05,916
But I won't ever

1754
01:46:06,541 --> 01:46:08,208
say your name again.

1755
01:46:09,583 --> 01:46:10,833
I can't.

1756
01:46:12,083 --> 01:46:13,291
I won't.

1757
01:46:14,125 --> 01:46:15,958
Then call me Scar.

1758
01:46:16,583 --> 01:46:19,833
So I will never forget
what I have done.

1759
01:46:20,625 --> 01:46:21,916
Scar.

1760
01:46:22,916 --> 01:46:24,625
Your Majesty.

1761
01:46:34,125 --> 01:46:35,583
Welcome home.

1762
01:46:42,875 --> 01:46:44,333
Your Majesty.

1763
01:46:52,291 --> 01:46:53,875
So, Mufasa,

1764
01:46:54,041 --> 01:46:56,790
I see your family
has been awaiting you

1765
01:46:56,791 --> 01:46:59,208
in <i>Milele</i> after all.

1766
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:01,958
Yes, Rafiki.

1767
01:47:03,250 --> 01:47:04,583
Yes, they were.

1768
01:47:11,583 --> 01:47:14,458
It is your time, Mufasa.

1769
01:47:15,625 --> 01:47:18,041
Rafiki, I wish
I could see him.

1770
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:20,500
I wish I could meet
my grandfather.

1771
01:47:20,666 --> 01:47:23,208
As Mufasa once told
your father,

1772
01:47:23,375 --> 01:47:25,458
look into the heavens, Kiara.

1773
01:47:25,625 --> 01:47:29,208
The great kings of the past
will always be there

1774
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,249
waiting for you.

1775
01:49:12,750 --> 01:49:13,833
Mmm...

1776
01:49:19,125 --> 01:49:21,165
I don't want him
to go, Rafiki.

1777
01:49:21,166 --> 01:49:22,708
I don't want it to end.

1778
01:49:23,291 --> 01:49:25,208
Don't you see, Kiara?

1779
01:49:25,583 --> 01:49:28,291
Mufasa lives in you.

1780
01:49:29,166 --> 01:49:31,541
He lives in you.

1781
01:49:33,791 --> 01:49:35,708
Dad!

1782
01:49:37,083 --> 01:49:39,291
- Rafiki.
- It was unbelievable.

1783
01:49:39,458 --> 01:49:41,333
- It was perfect.
- You could not improve on it.

1784
01:49:41,500 --> 01:49:43,041
That said, I do have notes.

1785
01:49:43,208 --> 01:49:45,666
Some suggestions. Take 'em
or leave 'em. But take 'em.

1786
01:49:47,208 --> 01:49:48,915
-  Dad!
-  Kiara!

1787
01:49:51,083 --> 01:49:53,208
Kiara.

1788
01:49:53,375 --> 01:49:54,375
Dad.

1789
01:49:54,791 --> 01:49:56,208
Where's Mom?

1790
01:49:56,375 --> 01:49:59,000
Well, love, there's
something you need to know.

1791
01:49:59,166 --> 01:50:01,375
What? Did something
happen to Mom?

1792
01:50:01,541 --> 01:50:03,833
Baby, I'm right here,
and I'm fine.

1793
01:50:04,041 --> 01:50:05,625
Where were you?

1794
01:50:05,791 --> 01:50:06,791
Kiara,

1795
01:50:06,958 --> 01:50:08,958
this is your new brother.

1796
01:50:09,125 --> 01:50:10,208
Brother?

1797
01:50:10,375 --> 01:50:11,625
I have a brother?

1798
01:50:12,583 --> 01:50:16,000
Hi there. I'm Kiara.
I will take care of you.

1799
01:50:16,541 --> 01:50:18,250
Forever.

1800
01:50:19,041 --> 01:50:20,333
Little one,

1801
01:50:20,500 --> 01:50:22,250
let me tell you a story.

1802
01:50:22,750 --> 01:50:25,500
A story of a great king.
