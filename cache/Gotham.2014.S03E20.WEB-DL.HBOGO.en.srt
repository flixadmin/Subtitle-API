1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,240
<i>Previously on</i>Gotham...

2
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:02,920
Welcome home, Bruce.

3
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,520
The Court is readying a weapon
that can destroy the city.

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,120
You've done it.
You weaponized the virus.

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,240
We have to escape.

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,760
In what way that's gonna happen?

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,520
- We work together.
- So that we may be free

8
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,320
to murder each other outside.

9
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,080
How do you expect to win, Oswald?

10
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,280
I have an army of Hugo Strange's
monsters in my command.

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,440
- Selina, stop.
- He's not Bruce.

12
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,520
Where is Bruce?

13
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,800
Bruce is serving
a greater purpose.

14
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:33,600
We found another owl.

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,480
We take this map indicates
secret hideouts of the court.

16
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:40,720
James Gordon, you loved him,
and that love doomed Mario.

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,560
But guess who's really to blame.

18
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,640
I am.

19
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,640
We will destroy
the Court of Owls

20
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,440
and then you will do
whatever I say.

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,400
- Won't you?
- Yes.

22
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,240
The virus sample we got
from Hugo Strange, it's gone.

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,520
- Maybe Lucius took it?
- No. Lee has it too.

24
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,720
The day of judgment
has come to Gotham

25
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,600
and to the Court of Owls.

26
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,960
Three years ago,
a great crime was committed.

27
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,240
Thomas and Martha Wayne
were murdered.

28
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:33,360
Their blood is on the Court's
hands.

29
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,720
On your hands.

30
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,600
Thomas Wayne stood
against the court.

31
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,680
He threatened to expose us.

32
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,760
He paid the price.

33
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,680
And my mother?

34
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,600
She had to die as well.

35
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,440
Why is Bruce Wayne here?

36
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,280
He has come to pass judgment.

37
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,040
Enough of this.

38
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,760
You are the leader of the Court.
No, one disputes that.

39
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,080
But you absent yourself
from Gotham for years at a time.

40
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,760
Decisions had to be made.

41
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,280
The Ruling Council stands
by its actions.

42
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,840
They were your parents, Bruce.

43
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,560
You knelt in their blood
that night in the alley.

44
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,560
Let blood avenge blood.

45
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,920
Give the order.

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,480
You hesitated.

47
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,400
Next time, I won't.

48
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,240
I promise.

49
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,080
No.

50
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,560
I know you won't.

51
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,040
- Keep me informed.
- Bullock.

52
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,360
Any word from Bruce?

53
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,080
{\an5}Alvarez said he wasn't
at the location.

54
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,080
{\an5}But they're checking out the next
black site on the map.

55
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,560
{\an5}All right.
Everybody else has the score.

56
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,120
{\an5}Court of Owls is planning
an attack on the city.

57
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,520
{\an5}They kidnapped Bruce Wayne

58
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,360
{\an5}and now they know we're coming
for them.

59
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,720
{\an5}So, be ready for anything.
Let's go.

60
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,680
{\an5}This is the Ruling Council.

61
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,680
{\an5}- Who could have done this?
- It's straight up execution.

62
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,960
{\an5}Gordon, we got a breather.

63
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,000
{\an5}Gordon. Traitor.

64
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,960
{\an5}Yeah, I'm a traitor.

65
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,080
{\an5}Where's Bruce Wayne?
Where's the bomb?

66
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,280
{\an5}We were betrayed.

67
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,800
{\an5}The leader, Bruce Wayne,
they killed us.

68
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,840
{\an5}That guy is lying.

69
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,920
{\an5}If Master Bruce wasn't in that room,
he's being held prisoner.

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,360
{\an5}I mean, it's absurd

71
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,320
{\an5}to think he had anything to do
with that carnage.

72
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,760
{\an5}I still don't get why the leader

73
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,080
{\an5}would whack his own
ruling council.

74
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,600
{\an5}I mean, does this mean the virus
bomb plan thing is off?

75
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,160
{\an5}Until we have the bomb
in our possession,

76
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,080
{\an5}we have to assume
the plan is still on.

77
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,520
{\an5}Maybe the leader was cleaning
house.

78
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,880
{\an5}So, what's the next step?

79
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,560
{\an5}Because we hit every spot
on that crystal owl

80
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,920
{\an5}and all we got were dead people
wearing owl masks.

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,040
{\an5}Run their identities,
we track their holdings,

82
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,320
{\an5}we see where it leads us.
It worked for Katheryn.

83
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,240
Yeah? And how long
is that gonna take them mate?

84
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,560
We're all trying to find Bruce,
Alfred.

85
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,080
We're doing everything we can.

86
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,600
If only that were enough?

87
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,280
- He's worried about the kid.
- I don't blame him.

88
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,720
I have no idea how Bruce fits
into the Court's plans.

89
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,640
But what we saw today,
them executing their own.

90
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,960
They're zealots.
Capable of anything.

91
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,440
Gordon, those uni's you put
on Thompkins' brownstone?

92
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,720
They called. She's home.

93
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,200
I know what you're thinking,
brother.

94
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,400
Lee stealing the virus. That's weird.

95
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,960
But injecting herself?

96
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,520
This is Lee we're talking about.

97
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,760
You didn't hear what she said
to me last night, Harvey.

98
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,960
Okay, fine. Go.

99
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,920
I will be back as soon as I can.

100
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,760
Come again?

101
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,800
I said Oswald Cobblepot is alive.

102
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,480
- He's lying.
- I wish that were true.

103
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,760
He disappeared for days

104
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,760
and then he shows up
with some insane story

105
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,720
about him and Penguin
being trapped in bird cages

106
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,240
and escaping together?

107
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,640
- What'd you say you used? Pudding?
- Red Jell-O.

108
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,720
How stupid do you think we are?

109
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,120
You really want me
to answer that?

110
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,200
It's a setup.

111
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,400
Well, you would know,
being an expert in betrayal.

112
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,560
Keep pushing me.

113
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,200
- Calm down. Both of you.
- In the interest of cooperation,

114
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,600
your partner is backstabbing

115
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,480
actually led to the answer
you were seeking.

116
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,280
Who controls Gotham?

117
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,800
It's an organization calling
themselves the Court of Owls.

118
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,000
And?

119
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,320
Who are they? What do they want?

120
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,400
Well, unfortunately
my interaction was limited

121
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,880
to a woman named Kathryn

122
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,080
who had a stern up-do.

123
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,640
But I can tell you there is
no interest in the underworld.

124
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,240
So, at least for now, you shouldn't
worry about them.

125
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:17,480
You should worry about Penguin.

126
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,920
I'm sorry.
How is that our problem again?

127
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,360
You're the one that shot him
and dumped him in the river.

128
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,080
Oh, Butch.

129
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,360
I knew that your hand
was made out of lead,

130
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,960
but I forgot
your brain was as well.

131
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,200
- Cute.
- Thank you.

132
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,320
The three of you conspired
to help me murder him.

133
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,880
So in Penguin's eyes
we're all guilty.

134
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,040
He's right.

135
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,920
I'll get a team to hit Penguin's
house right away.

136
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Don't bother.

137
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,840
He knows that's the first place
we'd show up.

138
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,080
He's probably stowed away
in some safe house.

139
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,440
Good thing, I know
where they all are.

140
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,640
Here we go, together again.

141
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,280
I should've told you...

142
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,600
Penguin has recruited an army
of Hugo Strange's monsters.

143
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,680
I'll take it from here.
Head back to the station.

144
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,120
Lee?

145
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,280
It's Jim.

146
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,400
Lee?

147
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,280
Lee?

148
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,160
Hello, Jim.

149
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,920
I knew you'd come.

150
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,760
Are you surprised?

151
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,280
You look surprised.

152
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,400
There's been a squad car
outside my house all morning.

153
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,880
That tells me you knew
I stole the virus.

154
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,600
Had you assumed
I inject myself?

155
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,720
- I'd hope I was wrong.
- That'll teach you.

156
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,800
Can I get you something?
I know how you like your whiskey.

157
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,040
- Why did you do this?
- You know, why, Jim.

158
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,360
You blame yourself
for what happened to Mario.

159
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,840
You didn't shoot him.
You didn't infect him.

160
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,400
It wasn't your fault.

161
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,640
I have to disagree with you
on that one.

162
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,960
But, honestly, the whole argument
is moot at this point.

163
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,040
No, it isn't.

164
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,520
Barnes was infected for weeks
before the virus fully took hold.

165
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,600
We can get you help.

166
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,640
I'm no virologist, but I'd say
we missed the boat on that one.

167
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,800
Come on, we can fight this.
Come with me.

168
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,920
Do you want to know
what the virus

169
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,280
has brought out of me, Jim?
What it shown me?

170
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,160
No.

171
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,600
My love for you.

172
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,360
It's pretty obvious
when you think about it.

173
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,160
Perfect Dr. Lee Thompkins.

174
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,920
Why would she be drawn to a man
with so much darkness

175
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,920
and such an appetite for violence?

176
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,360
Unless something inside her liked it.

177
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,840
Craved it.

178
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,040
Needed it.

179
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,040
It's not true.

180
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,000
The virus has shown me how
to give in to my deepest desires.

181
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:51,200
And I will no longer deny myself
what I really want.

182
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,560
There is problem, though, Jim,
isn't there?

183
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,440
You know, what the problem is,
don't you?

184
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,960
- Yeah. You need help.
- No. The problem...

185
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,200
Is that you are always denying
yourself who you really are.

186
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,000
But I can help you with that.

187
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,680
You see, Jim, I have a secret.

188
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,240
Harvey, I found something.

189
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,200
Right. This is a mocked up
of the map that Lucius made

190
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,960
of all the Court's black sites,
right?

191
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,400
One problem.

192
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,000
The place where Bruce
and I found the ritual crystal owl

193
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,080
should be here. Not.

194
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,320
But it's not.

195
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,560
Or maybe it's an old owl
that hasn't been updated.

196
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,200
No, mate. No.
You're missing the point. No.

197
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,840
Look, the Court has marked
all hideouts.

198
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,000
So, how'd you find the house
where you stole the owl?

199
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,640
Well, this is slippery.

200
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,520
Ukrainian smuggling firm
called the Whisper Gang.

201
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,880
And you're thinking that maybe
they know of other locations?

202
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,640
You know, where we can find
these clowns?

203
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,680
I do.

204
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,360
If there's any left alive.

205
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,200
What's he's so angry about?

206
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,280
We hunted down these freaks

207
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,200
to help him destroy Nygma
and Barbara.

208
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:23,440
We got this Freeze guy
and your pal Bridgit

209
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,040
- who does the fire...
- Wait. You found Bridgit?

210
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,400
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

211
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,720
Pengy disappeared the other day

212
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,280
and she and Freeze figured
he wasn't coming back,

213
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,720
so they split.

214
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,640
- Can you find her?
- Why?

215
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,120
There's a war coming between me
and Nygma and Barbara Kean.

216
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,960
- I need my army.
- What's in it for me?

217
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,960
My gratitude.

218
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,320
Fine.

219
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,600
Guys, we got company.
Not the good kind.

220
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,880
Ivy, let's go.

221
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,800
I can't leave Penguin.

222
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,440
Suit yourself.

223
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,240
You do have a way out, right?

224
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,840
Of course. This is a safe house.

225
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,800
Oswald!

226
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,120
Edward.

227
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,880
No, army of monsters? Such a shame.

228
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,640
- You want to kill him, or can I?
- Wait.

229
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,400
Something is wrong.

230
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,320
Oh, Ed.

231
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,880
So smart.

232
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,560
No!

233
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,000
- Damn it!
- Bravo, Oswald!

234
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,520
You're just delaying the inevitable.

235
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,880
Where's you far better half?

236
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,360
Where are you going, kitty cat?

237
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,960
Bruce.

238
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,880
What were you thinking about?

239
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,040
My parents.

240
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,080
I've wanted justice for them
for so long.

241
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,280
And now that I've achieved it...

242
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,160
What do you feel?

243
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,960
Failure.

244
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,800
I did not give the order.

245
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,240
You will get another chance
to prove yourself worthy.

246
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,640
Hello, Bruce.

247
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,760
It's good to see you again.

248
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,000
Hello, Professor.

249
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,800
Fascinating.

250
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,600
He's completely docile.

251
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:05,920
I'd like to hear your techniques,
Sensei.

252
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,560
One day, Professor.

253
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,520
Show me the weapon.

254
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,880
I told you, Bruce, that I did not
serve the Court.

255
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:29,640
I, we made use of the Court
for our own ends.

256
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,000
The one I serve believes
you have a great destiny.

257
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,600
My task has been
to prepare you for it.

258
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,600
But a final step remains
in your journey.

259
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,240
This detonator will trigger
the bomb.

260
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,160
Thousands will be affected
with a virus.

261
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:57,880
The city will be torn apart,
and out of the ashes...

262
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,720
A dark hero will rise.

263
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,360
You.

264
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:12,320
When the time comes,
you must press this button.

265
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,800
Are you ready to embrace
your destiny, Bruce?

266
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,480
Yes.

267
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,360
Gotham must fall.

268
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,120
Jim, me and Alfred got
a possible location on Bruce

269
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,000
from a bunch of Ukrainian yucks
wearing muzzles

270
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,360
if you can believe it.

271
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,680
Give me a call when you can.

272
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,160
Where the hell is Gordon, anyway?

273
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,600
He had to do something.

274
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,400
We're gonna have to give you
a badge or something

275
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,480
one of these days.

276
00:16:56,760 --> 00:17:00,920
Please be very careful with this.

277
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,400
G.C.P.D. Nobody.

278
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,640
Go get Bruce.

279
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,960
Don't move a muscle.

280
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,600
Obviously I surrender.

281
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,040
You know, where to take it.

282
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,160
Bruce!

283
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,080
Oh, thank god.

284
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,680
I see that you're the top boy,
aren't you?

285
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:34,880
The leader.

286
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,800
Step away from Bruce

287
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,360
or I swear to God I will shoot
you straight in the face.

288
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,640
You had best put down the weapon,
Mr. Pennyworth.

289
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,400
No, bloody likely, mate.

290
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,280
Bruce?

291
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,000
Bruce, get out of the line.

292
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,880
No, Alfred.

293
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,160
I will not let you hurt him.

294
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,200
What's he done to you?

295
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,960
He has lifted the burden
of my past.

296
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,840
Revealed my true destiny.

297
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,520
Gotham must fall by my hand.

298
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,800
No.

299
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,360
Bruce!

300
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,480
- Dwayne. Hey.
- Yes, sir?

301
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,960
Steve, put this animal in a cage.

302
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,920
I'll be back to bust your head
in a minute.

303
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,160
Alfred, hey.

304
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,360
Are you okay?

305
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,680
Far from it.

306
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,480
I mean the leader of the Court
has turned Bruce

307
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,400
into some kind of weird
zombie zealot.

308
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,480
I mean, I wouldn't believe it if
I don't seen it with my own eyes.

309
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,240
I think he wants Bruce
to detonate the bomb.

310
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,760
- What?
- Bruce said something

311
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:08,560
about it being his destiny.

312
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,040
How Gotham must fall
by his hand.

313
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,120
This is bad.

314
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,880
How are we gonna find that
freaking bomb?

315
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,160
Let's go see "Baldy-locks"
and see what he can tell us.

316
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,000
Harvey, I heard from the unis
at Doc Thompkins'.

317
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,040
No, sign of her or Gordon
or his car.

318
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,800
Put a BOLO out on Jim Gordon.

319
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,760
And put one out
on Lee Thompkins too.

320
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,240
I'm right here, Harvey.

321
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,440
Lee?

322
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,960
Hey.

323
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,360
It's good to see you.

324
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,840
You wouldn't happen to know
where Jim is, would you?

325
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,360
As a matter of fact,
he's probably waking up.

326
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,040
Right about now.

327
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,880
Lee?

328
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,680
Lee?

329
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,800
Lee!

330
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,040
Lee!

331
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:06,600
<i>Lee! Lee! Lee!</i>

332
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,680
Take it easy, everybody.

333
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,400
Guns down, people.

334
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,400
It's all right.
Everybody, just step back.

335
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,040
You really did it?

336
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,400
You injected yourself
with the virus.

337
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,120
You're just like Jim. You seem
to think it's a bad thing.

338
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,200
Where is he?

339
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,640
He went to see you
at you brownstone

340
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,400
and now we can't get in touch
with him.

341
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,560
Well, look at you all worried
about your hero.

342
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,400
You put him up on this pedestal.

343
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,640
Forced him to deny his true self.

344
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,080
I am going to free Jim

345
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,600
and show everyone
who he really is.

346
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,960
Where the hell is he?

347
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,920
He's in a coffin.

348
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,880
Six feet underground.

349
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,360
Did you kill him?

350
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,680
Who said anything
about killing him?

351
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,320
Bloody hell.

352
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,680
I said he was in a coffin.

353
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,040
He's not dead. Not yet.

354
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,320
Jeez.

355
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,560
I forgot how jumpy everybody is
around here.

356
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,560
Jim, are you there?

357
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,800
<i>Jim, you there?</i>

358
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,960
Lee, what the hell are you doing?

359
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,440
<i>Stay calm.
You gotta conserve your air.</i>

360
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,680
Listen to me.

361
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,080
A little late for that.

362
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,040
<i>Why don't say hi
to Harvey and the gang?</i>

363
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,640
Harvey? You there?

364
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,960
We're here, buddy. Where are you?

365
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,560
<i>Harvey, she's got the virus.
She's buried me alive.</i>

366
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,880
<i>I do the talking.</i>

367
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,160
<i>Now, if you're quiet,
I'll let you listen.</i>

368
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,960
So here's the deal.

369
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,880
I buried Jim Gordon alive.

370
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,000
In a location that you might find
if you looked long enough.

371
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,200
But certainly not before
he runs out of air.

372
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,400
<i>No, no. I'm the only one
who knows where he is.</i>

373
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,000
But, here's the kicker.

374
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,360
I left him a way out.

375
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,440
You hear that, Jim?

376
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,840
<i>I left you an escape hatch.
Have you found it yet?</i>

377
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,040
<i>You should have found it by now.</i>

378
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,640
You left me the virus.

379
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,360
I told you I would help you
find your darkness.

380
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,760
Now, I can't do it for you.

381
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,080
<i>You gotta do it yourself.</i>

382
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,080
I won't. I won't do it, Lee.

383
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,000
You got two options.

384
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,400
You can take the virus

385
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,920
<i>and find the strength,
then get out of there.</i>

386
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,720
Or you can make that coffin
your permanent home.

387
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,880
Lee, please. Please.

388
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:09,560
In the name of all that is holy,
not insane.

389
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,280
Tell us where he is.

390
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,440
I swear to god, I'll let you
walk right out of here.

391
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,440
Tell us where you buried him.

392
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,080
Why would I wanna walk
out of here, Harvey?

393
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,360
I'm gonna miss the look
on all of your faces

394
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,400
when he takes that virus.

395
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,520
And seeing that he's got
roughly an hour left of oxygen,

396
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,600
I'm not gonna have long to wait.

397
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,960
Can I get a cup of coffee?

398
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,120
Get the lady a cup of coffee!

399
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,040
Put her in a cell.

400
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,640
Don't worry, I'm not gonna bite.

401
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,880
All right, everyone,
Bruce Wayne is still missing.

402
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,480
There's still a freaking
terrorist attack

403
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,240
that can go down in any minute,
so get back to your jobs,

404
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,640
do what you're supposed
to be doing,

405
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,360
let me worry about Jim Gordon.

406
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,880
What do we got?

407
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,640
<i>- Jim, it's me. You there, buddy?</i>
- Harvey.

408
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,240
These radios run
on a shortwave frequency.

409
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,440
<i>I've gotta be close.
Get it over the Lucius.</i>

410
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,760
He should be able to run down
a general fix.

411
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,360
- Hang tight. We're on it.
- Let's go.

412
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,200
All right.

413
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,920
Conserve your breath.

414
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,560
Stay calm.

415
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,480
I'm not working for Penguin.

416
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,280
So, you were just
holed up together for kicks?

417
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,480
No. Ivy just
asked me to come by.

418
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:02,360
- Why?
- None of your business, lunk.

419
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,000
So, now I gotta take lip
off a kid?

420
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,200
You're friends with that firebug,
aren't you?

421
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,320
Her name is Bridgit.

422
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,000
Penguin's army of monsters
deserted him.

423
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,920
And he needed your help
finding them.

424
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
You're gonna tell Penguin
that you know where this...

425
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:27,400
Bridgit is,
and that you'd like to meet.

426
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,240
And we'll take care of the rest.

427
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,040
Fine.

428
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,720
But I need cash
to get out of town.

429
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:39,760
- Fine.
- And nothing happens to Ivy.

430
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,800
She's stupid, but not a traitor.

431
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,000
Those things
aren't mutually exclusive.

432
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,800
Shoo. The grown-ups need to talk.

433
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,120
Oh, and forgive me if I don't
want you knowing the details.

434
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,520
That didn't work out so well
last time.

435
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,520
Bye now.

436
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,040
How much longer
are we gonna put up with this?

437
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,320
<i>Jim!</i>

438
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,000
Harvey, what did you find?

439
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,440
<i>You were right about the walkie.</i>

440
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,000
It's got a one-mile radius.

441
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,160
Lucius couldn't trace a signal,
but when looked at the map,

442
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,480
we figured there's only one place
she can take you.

443
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:20,560
Jackson Park.

444
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,120
I should have known.
That's nothing but dense forest.

445
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,920
It's a place to start.

446
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,640
We're gonna find you, brother.
I promise.

447
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,840
Harvey. Listen,
I know he's your mate.

448
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,200
But with everything else
that's going on,

449
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,440
with Bruce missing, the bomb...

450
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,160
Are you certain searching for Jim
is the best use of your time?

451
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,840
The situation were reversed,
he'd do the same for me.

452
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,320
- Besides, I got you.
- What do you mean?

453
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,160
I want you to squeeze Strange.
Find out everything he knows.

454
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,080
I saw how you dealt
with that Kathryn bird.

455
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,240
You like to get your hands dirty.

456
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,600
Why, are you sure about this,
mate?

457
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,680
I want you to get your hands
really dirty.

458
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,480
I want you to find out

459
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,720
where the leader's taking Bruce,
find the bomb.

460
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,040
And however much or little
is left of Strange after that,

461
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,840
even if it's just a pinky,
we will throw in jail.

462
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,680
Thanks.

463
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,600
Campos, call the K-nine unit,

464
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,400
have them meet us in Jackson Park
now.

465
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,240
You can't save him, Harvey.

466
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,120
He's gonna take the virus.

467
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,800
And we're gonna be together
the way we were meant to be!

468
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,080
It's gonna be beautiful.

469
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,120
Get off!

470
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,760
I find this sound and screaming
deeply upsetting.

471
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,920
It affects my concentration.
And my grip!

472
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,200
Please. Don't let me fall.

473
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,840
We can discuss this
in a civilized manner.

474
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,720
Well, that's rich
coming from the likes of you.

475
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,400
It's about to poison
thousands of people

476
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,080
and turn them
into raving lunatics!

477
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,720
Now, where is Bruce Wayne

478
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,400
and where is the bomb?

479
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,520
If I tell you, you'll drop me.

480
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,000
I end up dead...

481
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,960
Either way.

482
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,200
Self-preservation, is it?
That's your game.

483
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,480
All right, then, Humpty.

484
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,360
I've got a swap deal for you.

485
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,440
Dang it, pop.

486
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,200
Your freedom...

487
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,120
To Bruce Wayne.

488
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,360
You don't have the authority
to let me go.

489
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,080
I didn't have the authority
just hanging off the side

490
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,760
of a bloody building, did I?

491
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,800
Hey. See that fire escape
over there?

492
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,920
That leads directly to the street
and to your freedom.

493
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,160
Now, I won't stop you.

494
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,800
I just wanna know
where my boy is.

495
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,880
All right.

496
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,600
The leader has taken Bruce
to Wayne Enterprises.

497
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,360
They'll have a view
of the street below

498
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,120
as it fills with people
infected by the virus.

499
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,160
- But you're too late.
- Why.

500
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,680
What time is the bomb going off?

501
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,760
5.00 pm but that's not
what I mean.

502
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:07,040
The Bruce Wayne you know
is gone.

503
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,920
His mind is no longer his own.

504
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,520
Oh, you're so wrong.

505
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,680
You have got no idea
how strong that boy is.

506
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,080
Now, I'm a man of my word.

507
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,840
You can walk.
Just as soon as you wake up.

508
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,280
I don't know what you mean.

509
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,400
Slag.

510
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,320
You seem troubled.

511
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,680
I hope it was not the encounter
with your manservant.

512
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,160
No.

513
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,640
If this is my destiny...

514
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,840
I do not want to fail.

515
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,080
You won't, Bruce.

516
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,080
All this.

517
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,720
Everything the Court of Owls
set in motion,

518
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,360
everything I have done,

519
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:11,280
has been to prepare you
for this moment.

520
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,560
And afterward...

521
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,360
I will bring you to the one whose
vision has singled you out.

522
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,320
He is very eager to meet you.

523
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,640
Harvey. Anything?

524
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,960
Nothing yet. We've covered
about 30 acres.

525
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,320
How are you holding up?

526
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,760
<i>Getting hard to breathe.</i>

527
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,320
Stay off the walkie.
You gotta conserve your air.

528
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,480
<i>That should be hard.</i>

529
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,920
I'm running low on battery.

530
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,360
Then quit your yapping.

531
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,880
<i>Harvey, there's too much
ground to cover.</i>

532
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,640
You've done everything you could.

533
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:07,760
Okay.

534
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,920
Go to Plan B.

535
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,160
Take the virus.

536
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,720
- No.
- If you don't, you'll die.

537
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,600
<i>Take the virus and we'll figure
something out.</i>

538
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,040
<i>I'm not gonna take the virus.
I won't become a monster.</i>

539
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,640
Hold on.

540
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,800
- Alfred!
- <i>Strange said</i>

541
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,920
<i>the bomb is due to detonate
at 5.00pm.</i>

542
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Five o'clock?
That's only in 20 minutes!

543
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,400
<i>- Where?
- He never said, mate.</i>

544
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,720
But he did say
that the leader and Bruce

545
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,080
heading directly
to Wayne Enterprises

546
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,320
to watch the fallout.

547
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,520
<i>Now, the rooftop looks directly
onto Union Station.</i>

548
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,760
The bomb's due to go off slap
bang in the middle of rush hour.

549
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,000
Wait! Stop!

550
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:08,400
I want every available unit
to Union Station.

551
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,720
I want it evacuated now. Go!

552
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,360
K-9, stay with me.

553
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,080
<i>Harvey, at 5.00pm.
Union Station is gonna be packed.</i>

554
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,840
Even with the evacuation,
thousands will be infected.

555
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,520
<i>Not if we find the bomb first.</i>

556
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,520
But I'm guessing it's not
gonna be sitting out in the open.

557
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,320
<i>- No, it will be hidden.</i>
- Where?

558
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,480
Yesterday, Kathryn said,

559
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,680
"Gotham will fall
when the clock stops."

560
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,880
What if she was talking
about a real clock?

561
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,120
The clock tower
in Union Station.

562
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,400
Harvey?

563
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,360
Harvey, do you hear me?

564
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,120
Harvey? Harvey, you copy?

565
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,080
Jim, I lost you! Jim?

566
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,280
Jim!

567
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,520
In the old days,
loyalty meant something.

568
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,640
Don Falcone. Maroni.

569
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,680
Even Fish.

570
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,920
They had their faults.
But they lived by codes.

571
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,560
Ed Nygma.

572
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,720
Barbara Kean.

573
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,320
They wouldn't even be allowed
to sit at the same table

574
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,120
as Don Falcone.
And yet, here I am

575
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,000
forced to demean myself
to do battle with them.

576
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,880
Yeah, people are dumb.

577
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,080
Plants are better.

578
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,240
You can trust them.

579
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:41,840
I have no more safe houses.

580
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,480
No, monsters.

581
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,440
I will not run from Ed Nygma.

582
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,200
Well, actually,
you have one monster.

583
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,440
- What?
- Selina called.

584
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,600
She found Bridgit.

585
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,680
She was gonna bring her by.

586
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,600
You're joking. That's...

587
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,480
Wait.

588
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,520
Why is Selina
suddenly helping me?

589
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,720
I don't know.

590
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,360
She was acting kind of weird.

591
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,680
Asking where we were,
did we have guns.

592
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,040
So I was like,
"We're all alone!"

593
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,480
You idiot!

594
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,560
- It was a set-up!
- No.

595
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:21,920
No, way.
Selina would never do that.

596
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,400
Unless they offered her money.

597
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,880
Hello again. Oswald.

598
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,840
Captain, over here.
I think we've found something.

599
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,520
We gotta get to Union Station.

600
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,480
That was Bullock.

601
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,760
Gordon's on his way
to Union Station.

602
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,360
He's infected with the virus.
Come on!

603
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,080
Hey!

604
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,080
You must be very proud
of yourself, Ed.

605
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,960
Thinking you outsmarted me.

606
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,160
Well, frankly,
it wasn't really a challenge.

607
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,480
Now, you're gonna do one thing
before you die.

608
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,760
Call me...

609
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,480
The Riddler.

610
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:07,680
No.

611
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,040
You have a choice, Oswald.

612
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,360
This can happen real quick,
or it can take hours.

613
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,440
Days.

614
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,120
- It will be...
- I'll take option B, Ed.

615
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:24,640
Since saying that ridiculous name
would be torture itself.

616
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,560
Very well.

617
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:35,080
Slow and painful it shall be.

618
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,680
Hello. Do I get no say
in all this?

619
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,480
- See how it feels?
- Guys.

620
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,440
You hear something?

621
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,080
This is a trap.

622
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,120
No, not exactly.

623
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,640
- Fish.
- Hello, Oswald.

624
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:07,280
Now, see that there.
That's a look of respect.

625
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,320
Or is it fear?

626
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,760
Hey, you, Fish.

627
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,120
- How have you been?
- Well, let's see.

628
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,240
I was alive...

629
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,720
And then I was dead.

630
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,760
And then I was alive.

631
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,080
Things are looking up.

632
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:30,480
My, my, my.

633
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,720
Now, this is quite the gathering.
You have to love Gotham.

634
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,080
People are always pointing guns
at each other.

635
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:41,680
- Why are you here?
- You shall...

636
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,800
See.

637
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,760
And as for you,
whoever you may be.

638
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,760
Please excuse us.

639
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,640
My little penguin and I...

640
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,080
Will be leaving.

641
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,560
Please. Carry on.

642
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,560
That woman always knew
how to make an entrance.

643
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,280
<i>- Attention, all passengers.</i>
- What?

644
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,040
<i>This is an emergency.
Please proceed to the nearest...</i>

645
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,280
Gordon! There you are.

646
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,560
<i>This is an emergency.</i>

647
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,360
<i>Please proceed
to the nearest exit.</i>

648
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,560
It's time.

649
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,320
Press the button.

650
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,040
Claim your destiny.

651
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:48,120
Let Gotham fall so you may rise.

652
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,560
No!

653
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,640
Whatever destiny he's sold you,
Bruce, he's lying.

654
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,240
- Press it, Bruce.
- Don't.

655
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,400
Bruce, don't.

656
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,240
I won't have him turn you
into a murderer.

657
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,080
<i>This is an emergency.</i>

658
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,600
<i>Please proceed to the nearest exit.</i>

659
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:27,000
Are you going to shoot me,
Alfred?

660
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,280
I wanna help you.

661
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,360
Reverse what he's done to you.

662
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,080
Bruce, if you press
that detonator,

663
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:38,560
there is no coming back.

664
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,720
He won't shoot you.

665
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,120
He's weak, Bruce.
But you are not.

666
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,400
Bruce. Please.

667
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,920
Give me the detonator, son.

668
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,240
No. You will press it!

669
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,000
Hello, lover.

670
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:09,960
I guess we're gonna have company.

671
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,520
Seek out the Yuyan building.

672
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:18,040
Find the demon's head.

673
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,760
Fulfill your destiny.

674
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,680
Bruce.

675
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,640
When you're ready
come and find me.

676
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,120
It's only a matter of time.

677
00:42:58,120 --> 00:42:59,200
It's too late.

678
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,880
You all right?
