- Seriously.

00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:38,039
You know, I guess
I felt... trapped.

781
00:40:39,062 --> 00:40:40,694
You know, in my life.

782
00:40:40,727 --> 00:40:42,679
I just felt so...

783
00:40:43,031 --> 00:40:44,439
Stuck.

784
00:40:45,782 --> 00:40:49,014
Yeah. And then I saw you.

785
00:40:50,327 --> 00:40:52,087
Then I saw you.

786
00:40:52,822 --> 00:40:54,070
Who are you?

787
00:40:54,647 --> 00:40:55,831
I'm Guy.

788
00:40:55,863 --> 00:40:58,039
No, who are you really?

789
00:40:58,070 --> 00:40:58,870
Still Guy.

790
00:40:58,903 --> 00:41:03,511
All of this,
leveling up so fast.

791
00:41:03,543 --> 00:41:06,006
Giving this whole
world the finger.

792
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:07,287
How are you pulling this off?

793
00:41:07,318 --> 00:41:10,198
I've never given anyone
any of my fingers.

794
00:41:10,231 --> 00:41:11,991
(CLICKS TONGUE,
WHISPERS) You work at Soonami, don't you?

795
00:41:12,022 --> 00:41:13,752
- No.
- You've got an inside track.

796
00:41:13,783 --> 00:41:15,415
- I work at the bank.
- Right. The bank.

797
00:41:15,446 --> 00:41:19,607
So, you're just this incredible hacker
who happens to work at the bank.

798
00:41:19,638 --> 00:41:21,143
Yes, I work at the bank.

799
00:41:21,175 --> 00:41:23,222
Where did you get that skin?

800
00:41:24,343 --> 00:41:26,006
It's always
sort of been there.

801
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:28,342
Why do people keep
asking me that question?

802
00:41:28,374 --> 00:41:30,294
I don't know, why do they?

803
00:41:33,207 --> 00:41:36,214
No, no.
Not doing that. I...

804
00:41:37,078 --> 00:41:38,582
What's happening right now?

805
00:41:38,615 --> 00:41:40,470
I don't know,
but I don't buy it.

806
00:41:40,502 --> 00:41:41,782
No.

807
00:41:41,814 --> 00:41:43,671
- Okay, fine. I'll forget it.
- Fine. Good.

808
00:41:43,702 --> 00:41:45,079
- I'll let it go.
- Yes.

809
00:41:45,496 --> 00:41:46,678
Great.

810
00:41:46,711 --> 00:41:48,215
We all have
our secrets, I guess.

811
00:41:48,246 --> 00:41:49,847
Yes, we do.

812
00:41:52,471 --> 00:41:53,431
Hey.

813
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:56,695
Do you like ice cream?

814
00:41:56,726 --> 00:41:59,832
MOLOTOVGIRL: I can't believe
I've never been here.

815
00:41:59,863 --> 00:42:01,686
Well, it's sort of a secret.

816
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,335
That's why me and my buddy, Buddy,
always come here. It's quiet and safe.

817
00:42:05,366 --> 00:42:06,998
Yeah, it makes sense.

818
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:10,614
No missions here.

819
00:42:10,647 --> 00:42:13,814
Oh, you gotta try this.
You're gonna think I'm crazy.

820
00:42:13,847 --> 00:42:15,382
This is my favorite flavor
in the whole world.

821
00:42:15,414 --> 00:42:16,503
We'll take two
of the usual, please.

822
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,783
ICE CREAM VENDOR:
You got it, Guy.

823
00:42:17,815 --> 00:42:19,799
It's bubble gum flavor.

824
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:21,559
You think I'm
crazy, don't you?

825
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:22,615
Guy...

826
00:42:22,646 --> 00:42:25,655
Get out of my brain hole!
I love bubble gum ice cream.

827
00:42:25,687 --> 00:42:27,575
No, you don't.
Are you making fun of me right now?

828
00:42:27,607 --> 00:42:29,974
No! Nobody likes
bubble gum ice cream.

829
00:42:30,007 --> 00:42:31,030
No, I do.

830
00:42:31,063 --> 00:42:32,407
I had a relationship end
over bubble gum ice cream.

831
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,622
- No way. Here.
- Yeah.

832
00:42:33,654 --> 00:42:35,222
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

833
00:42:35,255 --> 00:42:36,471
Mmm.

834
00:42:36,502 --> 00:42:37,814
How good is that?

835
00:42:37,847 --> 00:42:38,934
You can taste it?

836
00:42:38,966 --> 00:42:42,487
Taste it? It's like my tongue
had a baby with a sunrise.

837
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:43,766
- MOLOTOVGIRL: Mmm-hmm?
- Mmm.

838
00:42:45,016 --> 00:42:46,776
Coffee used to be
my favorite food,

839
00:42:46,807 --> 00:42:49,270
but compared to this,
it tastes like liquid suffering.

840
00:42:49,303 --> 00:42:51,287
- (LAUGHS)
- What?

841
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:52,310
(LAUGHING)

842
00:42:53,911 --> 00:42:56,694
Nothing. You're funny.

843
00:42:57,878 --> 00:42:59,256
- I am?
- Yeah.

844
00:42:59,287 --> 00:43:01,622
Weird funny. (CHUCKLES)

845
00:43:01,654 --> 00:43:04,151
But that's kind of my speed.

846
00:43:04,183 --> 00:43:06,231
Weird funny, that's
totally my speed, too.

847
00:43:06,262 --> 00:43:08,182
- Great.
- Yeah. I know a joke.

848
00:43:08,214 --> 00:43:09,750
A weird funny joke.
You wanna hear it?

849
00:43:09,782 --> 00:43:11,447
- Please.
- Okay.

850
00:43:11,479 --> 00:43:15,991
A homosexual and a man in a wheelchair
are trying to murder a very small child...

851
00:43:16,022 --> 00:43:18,456
- The cripple says to the homosexual...
- Whoa. Stop, stop.

852
00:43:18,487 --> 00:43:20,566
Stop! Where did you hear that?

853
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,999
A robbery. The gunman
told it to the driver

854
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:26,231
who thought it was hilarious,
so I memorized it and told everyone.

855
00:43:26,263 --> 00:43:27,959
Word of advice?

856
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:31,126
Don't crib your jokes
from the trolls of <i>Free City.</i>

857
00:43:31,158 --> 00:43:32,214
Trolls?

858
00:43:32,247 --> 00:43:33,654
Is that a swing set?

859
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,222
Holy...

860
00:44:06,807 --> 00:44:09,047
MOLOTOVGIRL: Okay,
this is too weird.

861
00:44:09,078 --> 00:44:12,023
Vintage Mariah, bubble gum ice
cream, and now swings?

862
00:44:12,054 --> 00:44:14,391
- This is too weird.
- I thought the same thing, too.

863
00:44:14,422 --> 00:44:15,767
I thought the same thing.

864
00:44:15,798 --> 00:44:18,806
When I was younger,
I was obsessed with swings.

865
00:44:20,151 --> 00:44:22,071
<i>Growing up in
my family, it was...</i>

866
00:44:22,102 --> 00:44:24,727
(SIGHS) You don't
wanna hear this. No.

867
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,806
Oh, I wanna hear everything.

868
00:44:26,838 --> 00:44:28,406
(HESITATES) Oh.

869
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:31,638
Growing up in my family,
it wasn't good enough to be great.

870
00:44:31,671 --> 00:44:35,351
You had to win,
and that pressure, you know,

871
00:44:35,383 --> 00:44:37,783
<i>it was just constant.</i>

872
00:44:37,814 --> 00:44:41,206
But when I was in the backyard
on that little swing...

873
00:44:41,238 --> 00:44:42,422
You know that moment,

874
00:44:42,454 --> 00:44:46,231
<i>that split second between
rising and falling,</i>

875
00:44:46,262 --> 00:44:48,374
when you're totally weightless,
it feels like you're free.

876
00:44:48,407 --> 00:44:49,398
In love.

877
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:51,511
Free. What you said. Yeah.

878
00:44:54,167 --> 00:44:56,280
I really wanna kiss you.
Is that weird?

879
00:44:57,496 --> 00:44:58,870
You want to kiss me?

880
00:45:00,311 --> 00:45:02,422
I wanna kiss you so badly.

881
00:45:02,454 --> 00:45:03,863
You want to kiss me badly?

882
00:45:03,894 --> 00:45:05,238
- No!
- No?

883
00:45:05,271 --> 00:45:07,096
No, no, no, no, no.
I wanna kiss you well.

884
00:45:07,126 --> 00:45:08,598
I mean, I'm an idiot,

885
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:10,231
so I say things
like an idiot sometimes.

886
00:45:10,262 --> 00:45:11,735
No, you're not. You're not.

887
00:45:11,767 --> 00:45:13,142
I mean, um,

888
00:45:14,006 --> 00:45:16,471
uh, if you know
how to, go for it.

889
00:45:16,503 --> 00:45:17,782
I know how.

890
00:45:18,934 --> 00:45:19,894
Okay.

891
00:45:21,943 --> 00:45:23,478
Here it goes.

better than ice cream.

I think someone's
at the door.

897
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:52,887
I'll say.

898
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,582
Well, this was great.

899
00:45:54,614 --> 00:45:57,720
- Yeah, it was.
- Let's meet up again sometime soon. Yeah?

900
00:45:57,751 --> 00:45:59,607
Yes. Definitely.

901
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:01,174
Maybe in the real world.

902
00:46:01,207 --> 00:46:02,551
What?

903
00:46:02,583 --> 00:46:03,926
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

904
00:46:03,958 --> 00:46:05,399
- Okay. Bye.
- Okay.

905
00:46:06,646 --> 00:46:08,503
Bye, Molotov.

906
00:46:08,536 --> 00:46:12,438
Hey... my real name is Millie.

907
00:46:13,398 --> 00:46:17,238
My real name
continues to be Guy.

908

(CONTINUES KNOCKING)
Millie! It's me, open up!

911
00:46:29,431 --> 00:46:31,702
- What?
- You were right.

912
00:46:31,734 --> 00:46:33,654
- You were right.
- Oh, come on in.

913
00:46:33,686 --> 00:46:36,215
You were right.
Our code, it is in <i>Free City</i>

914
00:46:36,247 --> 00:46:38,807
and, Millie, it works.

915
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:40,471
Yeah, I know.
But we don't have proof.

916

KEYS: Just forget about
that for one second.

917
00:46:42,487 --> 00:46:44,631
I'm saying that
our game, <i>Life Itself,</i>

918
00:46:44,664 --> 00:46:47,671
where characters would grow
and change and feel real...

919
00:46:47,703 --> 00:46:48,823
- Yeah?
- ...worked.

920
00:46:48,856 --> 00:46:50,519
- Keys.
- The AI worked.

921
00:46:50,551 --> 00:46:53,846
It's the reason why <i>Free City</i> is so
realistic and people love it so much.

922
00:46:53,878 --> 00:46:55,798
And of course it doesn't
look the same.

923
00:46:55,831 --> 00:46:58,646
There's no waterfalls,
there's no butterflies and unicorns,

924
00:46:58,678 --> 00:47:01,303
all the characters have different skins.
Of course they do.

925
00:47:01,336 --> 00:47:05,975
But the underlying code in the
game is the same. Our code.

926
00:47:06,007 --> 00:47:07,574
And Guy, I mean,
he has evolved way further

927
00:47:07,607 --> 00:47:08,951
than we thought
was even possible.

928
00:47:08,983 --> 00:47:11,158
Wait, are you talking about
the hacker in the NPC skin?

929
00:47:11,191 --> 00:47:14,680
Millie, I'm talking about the
fact that Blue Shirt Guy...

930
00:47:14,711 --> 00:47:15,766
MILLIE: Yeah?

931
00:47:15,798 --> 00:47:17,560
...is not a player.

932

He is an algorithm
who thinks he's alive.

933
00:47:20,471 --> 00:47:22,582
I mean, hell,
technically, he is alive.

- KEYS: Guy.

938
00:47:32,823 --> 00:47:34,006
- One who has been...
- Your Guy?

939
00:47:34,038 --> 00:47:35,382
- Holy...
- KEYS: This is a good thing.

940
00:47:35,414 --> 00:47:36,727
No, it's really bad.

941
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:40,182
Millie, his code, it's thousands
of times the size it should be.

942
00:47:40,214 --> 00:47:42,263
We did it, Mills.

943
00:47:42,295 --> 00:47:46,167
We did it. Everything that we wanted
to create, it actually happened.

944
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:49,879
Okay? Did you know that the
NPCs have private lives?

945
00:47:49,911 --> 00:47:52,023
One of the baristas learned how to make
a cappuccino through trial and error.

946
00:47:52,055 --> 00:47:54,294
I mean, that's really difficult.
I can't even do that.

947
00:47:54,326 --> 00:47:56,470
I can't even froth my own
oat milk in the morning.

948
00:47:56,502 --> 00:47:58,903
And the Bombshell
character in the game

949
00:47:58,935 --> 00:48:01,687
wrote a memoir that's
a searing indictment

950
00:48:01,720 --> 00:48:03,319
of gender roles,
the patriarchy...

951
00:48:03,351 --> 00:48:05,399
It's a little preachy in parts,
but overall, it's pretty good.

952
00:48:05,431 --> 00:48:06,710
Millie, we have
to celebrate!

953
00:48:06,742 --> 00:48:08,151
- No, this can't be happening.
- What are you talking about?

954
00:48:08,183 --> 00:48:10,870
- This is what we've been working for!
- No, I let him kiss me!

955
00:48:12,215 --> 00:48:13,718
So, yeah.

956
00:48:15,638 --> 00:48:16,695
(CHUCKLES)

957
00:48:16,728 --> 00:48:18,550
I'm sorry, wait,
you let who kiss you?

958
00:48:18,582 --> 00:48:19,575
MILLIE: Guy.

959
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:21,783
Guy?

960
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:26,134
The first time I kiss a
non-toxic guy in like forever

961
00:48:26,166 --> 00:48:28,854
and of course
he's not even real!

962
00:48:28,886 --> 00:48:30,295
Uh, there's not
a button for that.

963
00:48:31,159 --> 00:48:32,566
Oh, he found the button.

964
00:48:32,598 --> 00:48:33,942
- Okay.
- MILLIE: Yeah.

965
00:48:33,975 --> 00:48:36,406
- I am... I'm so confused.
- Why is it so hot?

966
00:48:36,438 --> 00:48:38,200
KEYS: And surprisingly
curious.

967
00:48:38,231 --> 00:48:41,688
(CHUCKLES) You let
an artificially intelligent

968
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:43,286
- video game character kiss you?
- Oh, okay,

969
00:48:43,318 --> 00:48:44,311
can you just stop
saying it like that?

970
00:48:44,342 --> 00:48:45,366
And then you
thought that would be...

971
00:48:45,398 --> 00:48:47,094
Because you have
got to meet him, Keys.

972
00:48:47,126 --> 00:48:50,070
He's funny, and he's sweet,
and he's so handsome.

973
00:48:50,102 --> 00:48:52,311
Oh, my God,
now I'm saying it out loud.

974
00:48:52,343 --> 00:48:56,311
Also, Millie, food for
thought, he's like four.

975
00:48:56,343 --> 00:48:57,399
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

976
00:48:57,431 --> 00:48:58,999
- Really? You're gonna do that?
- Really.

977
00:48:59,031 --> 00:49:00,855
Wow, you just made
that really creepy.

978
00:49:00,888 --> 00:49:02,263
(BOTH LAUGHING)

979
00:49:02,295 --> 00:49:04,310
Millie, put all that aside. Weird or
not, when people find out about this,

980
00:49:04,342 --> 00:49:06,999
you could win a Nobel Prize.
Oh, God.

981
00:49:07,031 --> 00:49:08,023
What?

982
00:49:08,055 --> 00:49:09,879
Oh, my God,
if they see this...

983
00:49:09,911 --> 00:49:11,094
- MILLIE: What? What is it?
- Oh!

984
00:49:11,126 --> 00:49:13,014
KEYS: Antwan. What else?

985
00:49:13,046 --> 00:49:15,383
He's lying.
He lied about using our code,

986
00:49:15,415 --> 00:49:17,686
he's been lying about the game
being backwards compatible.

987
00:49:17,718 --> 00:49:19,159
I think he's lying
about <i>Free City 1.</i>

988
00:49:19,191 --> 00:49:20,407
What are you talking about?

989
00:49:20,439 --> 00:49:23,863
KEYS: Look. You see? There's not
one mission, not one location...

990
00:49:23,895 --> 00:49:26,199
I mean, there's not even a single
character from <i>Free City 1</i> on here.

991
00:49:26,231 --> 00:49:27,606
<i>Free City 2</i>
is not an update...

992
00:49:27,638 --> 00:49:29,111
- It's a replacement.
- Exactly.

993
00:49:29,143 --> 00:49:30,711
So when <i>Free City 2</i>
launches on Monday...

994
00:49:30,743 --> 00:49:34,102
Blue Shirt Guy, all proof of our
code, everything will be deleted.

995
00:49:34,134 --> 00:49:35,767
He can't do that.

996
00:49:35,799 --> 00:49:38,806
I mean, this is artificial life we're
dealing with. I mean, that's insane.

997
00:49:42,167 --> 00:49:43,255
We're screwed.

998
00:49:43,991 --> 00:49:45,718
Maybe not.

999
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:47,895
If we can find our
original build in the game,

1000
00:49:47,927 --> 00:49:50,646
it'll prove that Antwan used our
code without properly licensing it.

1001
00:49:50,679 --> 00:49:53,015
And we just have to find it
before <i>Free City 2</i> launches.

1002
00:49:53,047 --> 00:49:54,294
We have 48 hours.

1003
00:49:54,326 --> 00:49:55,895
I've looked, Keys.
You know I have.

1004
00:49:55,927 --> 00:49:57,110
I know you have.

1005
00:49:57,142 --> 00:49:59,607
But now that we both know
about Blue Shirt Guy,

1006
00:49:59,639 --> 00:50:01,078
maybe he can help?

1007
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:03,351
That would mean
I'd have to tell him.

1008
00:50:03,383 --> 00:50:06,327
Millie, he's not gonna exist
once the sequel launches.

1009
00:50:07,575 --> 00:50:09,463
His whole world's
about to end.

1010
00:50:09,495 --> 00:50:11,702
Don't you think
he'd want a chance to save it?

1011
00:50:13,654 --> 00:50:15,831
- ICE CREAM VENDOR: Here you go.
- Thank you.

1012
00:50:15,863 --> 00:50:17,879
- You got it.
- MILLIE: Guy?

1013
00:50:17,911 --> 00:50:19,158
Hey! Hi!

1014
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:20,663
Guy, we need to talk.

1015
00:50:20,695 --> 00:50:23,351
What's going on with your voice?
Where's your Australian accent?

1016
00:50:23,383 --> 00:50:24,375
British.

1017
00:50:24,407 --> 00:50:26,870
I think I know an Australian
accent when I see one.

1018
00:50:26,902 --> 00:50:28,407
I turned off
the accent filter.

1019
00:50:29,718 --> 00:50:30,934
This is me.

1020
00:50:31,287 --> 00:50:32,311
Good.

1021
00:50:32,343 --> 00:50:34,423
Look, I have to tell you
something really important.

1022
00:50:34,455 --> 00:50:35,702
- Are you married?
- (GASPS)

1023
00:50:35,734 --> 00:50:36,534
No.

1024
00:50:36,566 --> 00:50:39,767
- Oh, God.
- (BOTH LAUGHING)

1025
00:50:39,799 --> 00:50:41,783
That would have been like
the worst thing ever.

1026
00:50:41,815 --> 00:50:43,639
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)
Maybe not the worst thing.

1027
00:50:43,959 --> 00:50:45,078
Huh.

1028
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:46,743
I have to show you something.

1029
00:50:47,863 --> 00:50:49,014
Okay.

1030
00:50:50,038 --> 00:50:52,022
(DISTANT SIREN WAILING)

1031
00:50:54,135 --> 00:50:54,999
Wow!

1032
00:50:55,031 --> 00:50:57,015
I always wondered
what was in here.

my friend, I know that guy.

1039
00:51:14,647 --> 00:51:16,567
I don't get it.
What is this place?

1040
00:51:16,599 --> 00:51:21,015
There is no easy way to say
this, but this city is a game.

1041
00:51:21,047 --> 00:51:23,446
There's no easy way to say
this, I know it's a game.

1042
00:51:23,478 --> 00:51:25,303
You taught me how to play it.
(PLAYFULLY) Boop-boop.

1043
00:51:25,335 --> 00:51:26,679
MILLIE: Yes,
you're right, I did.

1044
00:51:26,711 --> 00:51:30,390
But it's not just that it's like a game.
It is a game.

1045
00:51:30,423 --> 00:51:33,719
It's a video game.
And that's all it is.

1046
00:51:33,751 --> 00:51:36,599
So the entire world is a game?

1047
00:51:36,631 --> 00:51:37,687
Yes.

1048
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:39,607
And we're all just
players in the game?

1049
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:41,813
Not exactly.

1050

I'm a player.

All these people here are players.
We live in the real world.

But you only exist here.

It's why you can
never leave Free City.

Wait, hold on a second.
Just stop for a second.

I wanna make sure
I'm getting this straight.

1069

I just wanna fully
understand here.

So, I'm fake?

I'm not even a main character,

I'm just this idiot

Millie, why are you even saying this?
I love you.

You only think that because
it's in your programming.

you to listen to me.

In two days,
the game is gonna shut down. For good.

you, all the people in it
who aren't players,

1079
00:52:53,047 --> 00:52:54,455
they'll be gone forever.
You need to listen.

1080
00:52:54,487 --> 00:52:57,431
My whole life, I felt like
there had to be something more.

1081
00:52:57,463 --> 00:52:59,573
And then I saw you.

1082
00:52:59,607 --> 00:53:02,615
And I knew I was right.
I was right!

1083
00:53:03,511 --> 00:53:05,911
And for a second,
I felt amazing.

- I know.
- Except you don't know.

Because we're not the same.

Isn't that what you said?
You said that.
