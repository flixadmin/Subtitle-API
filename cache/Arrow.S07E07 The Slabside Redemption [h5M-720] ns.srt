1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,742
My name is Oliver Queen.

2
00:00:01,745 --> 00:00:04,215
After 6 years of being a vigilante,

3
00:00:04,218 --> 00:00:05,906
the only way to achieve my goal

4
00:00:05,909 --> 00:00:09,311
and save my city was to confess
to being the Green Arrow.

5
00:00:09,314 --> 00:00:13,191
Now my family and friends must
carry on my mission without me.

6
00:00:13,194 --> 00:00:14,965
I am no longer a hero.

7
00:00:14,968 --> 00:00:18,867
I am inmate 4587.

8
00:00:19,554 --> 00:00:22,625
Previously on "Arrow"...

9
00:00:22,628 --> 00:00:23,869
Hmm?

10
00:00:23,871 --> 00:00:25,104
Felicity, don't.

11
00:00:25,106 --> 00:00:27,206
We need him to help Oliver.

12
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:29,775
I made a deal with the feds, a trade...

13
00:00:29,777 --> 00:00:31,911
Diaz for your husband.

14
00:00:31,913 --> 00:00:33,379
Oliver's coming home?

15
00:00:33,381 --> 00:00:34,661
Why'd you kill Dunbar?

16
00:00:34,664 --> 00:00:35,981
I didn't kill that guard.

17
00:00:35,983 --> 00:00:37,421
Your blade says you did.

18
00:00:37,424 --> 00:00:38,739
Guards found prints on it.

19
00:00:38,742 --> 00:00:40,920
Turner, you're going to the hole.

20
00:00:40,922 --> 00:00:43,589
W-wait. You got the wrong guy.

21
00:00:43,591 --> 00:00:45,359
If you hadn't found Turner's blade,

22
00:00:45,362 --> 00:00:46,958
it would have been all over for me.

23
00:00:46,961 --> 00:00:49,046
You were in the hole, Stanley,

24
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:53,156
so how'd you know it was Turner's blade?

25
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:55,926
I guess I must have heard it somewhere.

26
00:01:17,792 --> 00:01:21,645
Good morning, 4587.

27
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:24,764
A beautiful day.

28
00:01:24,766 --> 00:01:26,426
Be ready for an escort

29
00:01:26,429 --> 00:01:29,602
to receiving and releasing in 6 hours.

30
00:01:29,604 --> 00:01:31,039
As of this afternoon,

31
00:01:31,042 --> 00:01:33,576
you will be a pain
in someone else's ass.

32

33
00:02:06,104 --> 00:02:09,372
Did you know Queen's
getting out of here today?

34
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:11,477
I did, actually.

35
00:02:13,414 --> 00:02:15,247
He told me...

36
00:02:17,018 --> 00:02:20,553
When I told him how
much I was gonna pay.

37
00:02:26,093 --> 00:02:28,227
Get me a change of clothes.

38
00:02:28,229 --> 00:02:31,864
Get rid of them.

39
00:02:31,866 --> 00:02:34,247
I got a score to settle.

40
00:02:35,682 --> 00:02:37,348
I can't believe it.

41
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:39,004
You're gonna get out of here,

42
00:02:39,006 --> 00:02:42,545
be able to eat real food, not this crap.

43
00:02:42,548 --> 00:02:45,082
I'm really happy for you, man.

44
00:02:45,085 --> 00:02:46,421
I mean, I'm gonna miss you,

45
00:02:46,424 --> 00:02:47,723
but the Green Arrow

46
00:02:47,726 --> 00:02:50,500
never should've been put behind bars.

47
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,536
Remember when I told you

48
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,253
that I was wrongfully accused?

49
00:02:54,255 --> 00:02:56,671
I was thinking maybe now
that you're getting out,

50
00:02:56,674 --> 00:02:59,390
you could ask your friend Laurel

51
00:02:59,393 --> 00:03:00,926
to help with my appeal, too.

52
00:03:00,928 --> 00:03:01,894
Stop.

53
00:03:01,896 --> 00:03:03,156
I know. It's a big ask,

54
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:06,520
but, honestly, I don't
know how long I can survive

55
00:03:06,523 --> 00:03:07,950
in here without you.

56
00:03:07,953 --> 00:03:11,570
Stanley, I'm not gonna help you, okay,

57
00:03:11,572 --> 00:03:14,273
because in here

58
00:03:14,275 --> 00:03:16,075
is exactly where you belong.

59
00:03:16,077 --> 00:03:18,377
What are you talking about?

60
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:23,184
You killed Dunbar, and
then you manipulated me

61
00:03:23,187 --> 00:03:25,046
into blaming Turner for it.

62
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:26,685
What are you talking about?

63
00:03:26,687 --> 00:03:29,054
Oliver, we're, like, best friends.

64
00:03:29,056 --> 00:03:31,090
We were never friends.

65
00:03:34,128 --> 00:03:35,756
I was just doing

66
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,414
what the Green Arrow
always does to bad guys.

67
00:03:38,417 --> 00:03:39,781
I don't kill innocent people.

68
00:03:39,784 --> 00:03:41,499
But you hurt them.

69
00:03:41,502 --> 00:03:43,736
Remember what you did to Yorke?

70
00:03:43,738 --> 00:03:46,772
To those other guards
to get sent to Level 2?

71
00:03:50,311 --> 00:03:52,332
Prison changes people.

72
00:03:52,335 --> 00:03:54,013
It didn't change me.

73
00:03:54,015 --> 00:04:00,586
When I get out of here, I promise you...

74
00:04:00,588 --> 00:04:03,756
You will face justice for what you did.

75
00:04:03,758 --> 00:04:05,391
If you do that,

76
00:04:05,393 --> 00:04:07,993
I'm gonna spend the
rest of my life in here.

77
00:04:07,995 --> 00:04:09,595
I know.

78
00:04:11,499 --> 00:04:13,832
That's what you deserve.

79
00:04:13,834 --> 00:04:16,268
Don't do this. Don't do this to me.

80
00:04:34,614 --> 00:04:37,281
I heard the news... Early release.

81
00:04:37,284 --> 00:04:38,817
You're a lucky boy.

82
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:42,461
Too bad Turner wasn't so lucky.

83
00:04:42,463 --> 00:04:45,598
You know, after today,

84
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,867
you're never gonna see my face again.

85
00:04:48,869 --> 00:04:50,411
Tossers like you

86
00:04:50,414 --> 00:04:52,371
don't stay on the outside for long.

87
00:04:52,373 --> 00:04:55,240
Wouldn't be surprised if you
was back here pretty soon.

88
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:59,044
This ain't good-bye, Queen.

89
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:04,383
Turner.

90
00:05:06,187 --> 00:05:08,654
You have a death wish or something?

91
00:05:10,312 --> 00:05:12,145
I'm gonna find my way out of here.

92
00:05:12,148 --> 00:05:15,504
And when I do, I'm coming for you.

93
00:05:15,507 --> 00:05:18,597
I know that you didn't
kill Officer Dunbar.

94
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:21,800
I made a mistake,

95
00:05:21,802 --> 00:05:23,635
and I'm sorry.

96
00:05:23,638 --> 00:05:26,239
What the hell do I care if you're sorry?

97
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,674
I'm getting released.

98
00:05:28,676 --> 00:05:31,162
I'm gonna make this right for you.

99
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:33,165
Of course you're getting out today.

100
00:05:33,168 --> 00:05:34,801
I'm gonna speak with Lyla Michaels

101
00:05:34,804 --> 00:05:35,926
at A.R.G.U.S.,

102
00:05:35,929 --> 00:05:40,052
and I'll just see if we

103
00:05:40,054 --> 00:05:42,153
can make some kind of deal, okay?

104
00:05:42,156 --> 00:05:44,623
Yeah, I know how much promises are worth

105
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:47,218
to people like you, especially when you

106
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:48,817
make them to people like me.

107
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,295
That's not true.

108
00:05:50,297 --> 00:05:53,004
Yeah. You think I'm a criminal...

109
00:05:53,007 --> 00:05:55,434
You said it yourself...

110
00:05:55,436 --> 00:05:57,465
And criminals belong behind bars.

111
00:05:57,468 --> 00:05:59,179
Isn't that right?

112
00:05:59,182 --> 00:06:03,875
I think that years ago,
you saved Lyla's life.

113
00:06:03,878 --> 00:06:06,245
Now, I don't know

114
00:06:06,247 --> 00:06:08,280
if you can be that kind of hero again...

115
00:06:10,317 --> 00:06:12,918
But I think you deserve
the chance to try.

116
00:06:14,989 --> 00:06:17,523
I have to go.

117
00:06:17,525 --> 00:06:20,125
I'm gonna make this right.

118
00:06:37,476 --> 00:06:40,359
_

119
00:06:44,518 --> 00:06:47,286
Get up, 4587.

120
00:06:47,288 --> 00:06:50,622
You got a visitor.

121
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,804
Hello, Oliver.

122
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,155
Huh.

123
00:07:38,596 --> 00:07:40,596
I see that prison life

124
00:07:40,598 --> 00:07:42,765
hasn't been treating you so well.

125
00:07:42,767 --> 00:07:44,434
You listen to me very carefully.

126
00:07:44,437 --> 00:07:45,757
I don't think you're in the place

127
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,593
to be giving demands right now...

128
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:54,163
Not unless you want

129
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,710
a whole bunch of innocent people to die.

130
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,784
When I heard that...

131
00:08:01,786 --> 00:08:05,421
You were getting released today,

132
00:08:05,423 --> 00:08:09,625
it felt as if...

133
00:08:09,627 --> 00:08:15,264
My last chance at payback

134
00:08:15,266 --> 00:08:17,333
was getting away.

135
00:08:18,703 --> 00:08:20,703
And I couldn't have that.

136
00:08:20,705 --> 00:08:22,905
So that's your play?

137
00:08:24,274 --> 00:08:26,975
You're gonna come after
me in a federal prison?

138
00:08:26,978 --> 00:08:28,444
Mm-hmm.

139
00:08:31,516 --> 00:08:35,084
See, I've been in and
out of places like this

140
00:08:35,086 --> 00:08:37,286
my whole life.

141
00:08:37,288 --> 00:08:42,291
I know how to handle guards like that.

142
00:08:42,293 --> 00:08:44,327
Now, you, brother...

143
00:08:46,329 --> 00:08:48,730
They don't see you as
Green Arrow in here.

144
00:08:48,733 --> 00:08:53,302
You're just a number.

145
00:08:53,304 --> 00:08:56,972
It's pretty dehumanizing, isn't it?

146
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,249
Bet you weren't thinking about that

147
00:09:00,252 --> 00:09:03,678
when you were locking
these people up in here.

148
00:09:03,681 --> 00:09:05,548
Well...

149
00:09:06,951 --> 00:09:10,046
I'm not gonna do that to you.

150
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,759
I'm gonna end you.

151
00:09:16,761 --> 00:09:19,695
You're going to die today.

152
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:26,669
And I'm gonna be the
one who's gonna do it.

153
00:09:29,507 --> 00:09:32,174
But before that...

154
00:09:32,176 --> 00:09:36,145
I'm gonna make you suffer...

155
00:09:36,147 --> 00:09:40,465
The way you made me suffer.

156
00:09:40,468 --> 00:09:42,318
And when I'm done with you,

157
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,780
oh, I'm just gonna, you know,

158
00:09:45,783 --> 00:09:50,691
pay a little visit to Felicity...

159
00:09:50,694 --> 00:09:53,495
Yeah...

160
00:09:53,498 --> 00:09:56,565
And little William.

161
00:09:58,503 --> 00:10:01,937
And I'm gonna make sure

162
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:05,674
that this time,

163
00:10:05,676 --> 00:10:08,577
I finish the job.

164
00:10:12,517 --> 00:10:15,684
Hey! Get in there! Get in there now!

165
00:10:15,686 --> 00:10:18,254
Hey! Let me go!

166
00:10:18,256 --> 00:10:19,538
That's Ricardo Diaz...

167
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:21,107
Get over there! Get him! Pickup!

168
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,558
That's Ricardo Diaz!

169
00:10:23,561 --> 00:10:25,628
Get over there.

170
00:10:34,405 --> 00:10:35,638
Hey, you,

171
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,807
where do you think you're going?

172
00:10:55,626 --> 00:10:59,632
You're lucky we didn't throw
you in the hole, inmate.

173
00:10:59,635 --> 00:11:01,997
I don't care if this is your last day.

174
00:11:01,999 --> 00:11:03,335
As long as you are in here,

175
00:11:03,338 --> 00:11:05,460
you will still follow the rules.

176
00:11:05,463 --> 00:11:06,757
You don't understand.

177
00:11:07,869 --> 00:11:09,382
That was Ricardo Diaz.

178
00:11:09,385 --> 00:11:11,577
He is here inside the prison.

179
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:14,047
You need to let me help you stop him.

180
00:11:15,613 --> 00:11:18,547
Slabside is a Level 4 supermax facility.

181
00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:21,226
- That doesn't matter.
- We have 50 officers on duty,

182
00:11:21,229 --> 00:11:23,257
each one of them a trained professional.

183
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,312
Trust me. We have it covered.

184
00:11:25,315 --> 00:11:27,623
Trust me.

185
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,925
That is not gonna be enough against him.

186
00:11:29,927 --> 00:11:33,195
You only have a few hours
left in here, inmate.

187
00:11:33,197 --> 00:11:36,069
I suggest you stay quiet until then.

188
00:11:39,003 --> 00:11:40,636
Diaz is here?

189
00:11:40,638 --> 00:11:44,707
Oliver, please talk to
me. What are we gonna do?

190
00:12:02,217 --> 00:12:04,484
I know you're still mad
about the Dunbar thing,

191
00:12:04,487 --> 00:12:06,861
but this is Diaz.

192
00:12:06,864 --> 00:12:10,533
I mean, everyone deserves
a second chance, right?

193
00:12:38,663 --> 00:12:41,497
Oh, my god. You're
"Shawshanking" out of here.

194
00:12:46,337 --> 00:12:47,836
Oliver, you got to take me with you.

195
00:12:47,838 --> 00:12:49,772
Stay out of this!

196
00:12:55,446 --> 00:12:58,514
4587, stand down.

197
00:12:58,516 --> 00:13:02,288
If you are not gonna call
for backup, then I will.

198
00:13:04,221 --> 00:13:05,788
Let me go.

199
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,790
You don't want this.

200
00:13:10,227 --> 00:13:13,437
I said, stand down.

201
00:13:38,155 --> 00:13:40,055
Whoa.

202
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:45,427
Kiss your early release good-bye.

203
00:13:53,237 --> 00:13:55,170
Target's on the third floor.

204
00:13:55,172 --> 00:13:57,740
Initiate lockdown procedure now!

205
00:14:01,093 --> 00:14:02,592
Lockdown, Level One...

206
00:14:02,595 --> 00:14:04,646
Secure perimeter door now!

207
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:06,515
Lockdown, Level One.

208
00:14:06,585 --> 00:14:08,741
Lockdown, Level One.

209
00:14:08,819 --> 00:14:10,686
Lockdown, Level One.

210
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:17,422
Hey! Are we gonna be here all day?

211
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:19,658
You are gonna be here as long as we say.

212
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,259
You got that, inmate?

213
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:22,994
Inmates!

214
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:28,700
Look at yourselves.

215
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:31,336
You're on your knees.

216
00:14:31,338 --> 00:14:35,107
You're cowering before
men who are weak...

217
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,944
Men who are beneath you.

218
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:42,948
I've been where you are.

219
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,718
I know how it feels

220
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,955
to be treated like an animal.

221
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:54,770
You can only take that for so long.

222
00:14:54,773 --> 00:14:58,029
Hey, why don't you zip it, pal?

223
00:15:01,368 --> 00:15:02,768
Hyah!

224
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:17,983
Stand up!

225
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,322
These guards, they imprisoned you.

226
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:26,224
Yeah.

227
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:28,994
They disrespected you.

228
00:15:28,996 --> 00:15:30,762
Yeah!

229
00:15:30,764 --> 00:15:33,005
They taunted you.

230
00:15:33,008 --> 00:15:34,574
Yeah!

231
00:15:34,577 --> 00:15:36,568
You all want to make 'em pay?

232
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:37,965
Yeah!

233
00:15:37,968 --> 00:15:40,439
You all want to make 'em pay?

234
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:42,007
Yeah!

235
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:43,575
Make 'em pay!

236
00:15:43,577 --> 00:15:45,811
Yeah!

237
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,020
No sign of 4587.

238
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:18,977
You made quite the mess there, Queen.

239
00:16:20,214 --> 00:16:22,481
Taking out prison guards doesn't seem

240
00:16:22,483 --> 00:16:25,283
a very Green Arrow thing to do.

241
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:27,252
I guess this place
really has changed you.

242
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:30,155
I don't have time for
this. Ricardo Diaz is here!

243
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:33,348
And he will not think
twice about killing us all.

244
00:16:33,351 --> 00:16:35,660
No, he won't think
twice about killing you.

245
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,616
You see, I just met him.

246
00:16:37,619 --> 00:16:38,997
He seems a reasonable chap.

247
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,966
Of course you're working for Diaz.

248
00:16:40,968 --> 00:16:43,001
No. I don't work for anybody.

249
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,836
You see, me and Sampson,

250
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:47,405
we got our own plans, as per usual,

251
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:49,520
but I could always take

252
00:16:49,523 --> 00:16:51,977
a little time out for a bit of fun.

253
00:17:00,187 --> 00:17:01,887
Aah!

254
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:28,914
Ugh!

255
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,448
Aah!

256
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,618
Been waiting to do that
for a long time now.

257
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:37,522
Bad move, Turner.

258
00:17:45,699 --> 00:17:47,699
Sampson...

259
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:49,491
That was your femoral artery.

260
00:17:49,494 --> 00:17:51,160
You've got maybe 6 minutes

261
00:17:51,163 --> 00:17:52,744
before you bleed out.

262
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:01,734
- Hyah! Hyah! Hyah...
- Hyah! Hyah! Hyah...

263
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:10,155
You're not going after them?

264
00:18:10,157 --> 00:18:11,790
I've got better things to do.

265
00:18:11,792 --> 00:18:13,191
Thanks for your help.

266
00:18:13,193 --> 00:18:14,835
It doesn't mean I like you.

267
00:18:14,838 --> 00:18:16,437
Turner...

268
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,065
How did you get out of your cell?

269
00:18:20,067 --> 00:18:22,334
How did you get out of yours?

270
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:49,761
What are you looking for?

271
00:18:49,763 --> 00:18:52,764
Ricardo Diaz broke into the prison.

272
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:55,266
People usually break out of prison.

273
00:18:58,038 --> 00:18:59,704
He wants to kill me,

274
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:02,841
and he will kill as
many people as he has to

275
00:19:02,843 --> 00:19:04,776
in order for that to happen.

276
00:19:04,778 --> 00:19:06,711
I thought I had a lot of enemies.

277
00:19:06,713 --> 00:19:08,749
Don't have a signal. Come on.

278
00:19:08,752 --> 00:19:12,583
Hello. Are you having
technical difficulties?

279
00:19:12,586 --> 00:19:14,069
It's a little, uh,

280
00:19:14,072 --> 00:19:16,973
little going away present
from the Longbow Hunters.

281
00:19:16,976 --> 00:19:20,546
They jammed the signal,
so no calls in and out.

282
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:22,993
You are so predictable, you know that?

283
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:24,929
You're trying to make a call for help?

284
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:28,800
You're trying to save the day?

285
00:19:28,802 --> 00:19:31,036
Ohh.

286
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:35,674
I have someone here that
wants to say hello to you.

287
00:19:37,077 --> 00:19:38,410
Go ahead.

288
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:40,845
Don't do anything he tells you to do.

289
00:19:49,124 --> 00:19:51,056
Try again.

290
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:56,594
You have failed this city, Oliver Queen.

291
00:19:56,596 --> 00:19:59,731
Diaz, that's enough. Let him go!

292
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:03,148
You speak and people do as you say?

293
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:05,418
That's how it goes?

294
00:20:05,421 --> 00:20:07,939
Doesn't matter if you're right or wrong?

295
00:20:11,912 --> 00:20:13,878
Not this time.

296
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,718
Not anymore.

297
00:20:24,101 --> 00:20:26,291
How's that feel?

298
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:33,231
How's it feel, somebody
else playing God?

299
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,433
This is between you and me,

300
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:38,785
and no one else needs to die, okay?

301
00:20:38,788 --> 00:20:41,239
Wrong!

302
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:42,874
Wrong again.

303
00:20:42,876 --> 00:20:45,877
I want you to spend the last hours

304
00:20:45,879 --> 00:20:49,881
of your pathetic life knowing

305
00:20:49,883 --> 00:20:52,784
that these men, they died...

306
00:20:52,786 --> 00:20:55,457
They died because of you.

307
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,889
I'm coming for you.

308
00:20:57,891 --> 00:21:00,840
But will you make it in
time to save the guards?

309
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:03,512
It was hard enough getting
through a few prisoners.

310
00:21:03,515 --> 00:21:05,441
I wonder what it's gonna be like

311
00:21:05,444 --> 00:21:09,400
going against the entire prison.

312
00:21:24,326 --> 00:21:25,859
Keep your head down.

313
00:21:25,861 --> 00:21:28,033
They're not gonna mess
with me. They know better.

314
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,458
It's not about them.

315
00:21:29,461 --> 00:21:31,041
Diaz knew we were in the locker room,

316
00:21:31,044 --> 00:21:32,666
which means he's watching us.

317
00:21:32,669 --> 00:21:34,471
There are only two
rooms with camera access.

318
00:21:34,474 --> 00:21:35,602
There's the main security room...

319
00:21:35,604 --> 00:21:37,537
No way he got in there.
It's too fortified.

320
00:21:37,539 --> 00:21:39,539
Then he's in the control
room in the mess hall.

321
00:21:39,541 --> 00:21:41,526
That's where we have to go.

322
00:21:41,529 --> 00:21:42,909
There's no "we."

323
00:21:42,911 --> 00:21:44,263
I saved your ass

324
00:21:44,266 --> 00:21:45,612
so you could get me
a deal with A.R.G.U.S.

325
00:21:45,614 --> 00:21:47,147
doesn't mean we're some kind of team.

326
00:21:47,149 --> 00:21:49,249
Did you hear Diaz?

327
00:21:49,251 --> 00:21:51,618
He's killing hostages.

328
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,119
You said I was wrong about you?

329
00:21:54,122 --> 00:21:56,022
You said you've changed?

330
00:21:56,025 --> 00:21:57,758
Prove it.

331
00:22:00,997 --> 00:22:02,630
The only way to the mess hall is

332
00:22:02,633 --> 00:22:03,899
through the cell block.

333
00:22:03,902 --> 00:22:05,170
It'll be 10 times worse in there.

334
00:22:05,172 --> 00:22:06,566
This place is already a powder keg,

335
00:22:06,568 --> 00:22:08,201
and it's about to blow.

336
00:22:08,203 --> 00:22:10,671
It's the only way to the mess hall.

337
00:22:17,946 --> 00:22:19,946
These inmates are gonna kill them.

338
00:22:28,657 --> 00:22:30,791
And if we don't get out
of here, they may kill us,

339
00:22:30,793 --> 00:22:32,793
and, clearly, we'll never
make it to the mess hall.

340
00:22:32,795 --> 00:22:35,729
I'm not gonna let innocent people die.

341
00:23:22,044 --> 00:23:23,577
Uh!

342
00:23:23,716 --> 00:23:26,346
Uh!

343
00:23:26,348 --> 00:23:28,215
Hyah!

344
00:23:28,217 --> 00:23:30,250
Uh!

345
00:23:51,974 --> 00:23:53,874
Come on.

346
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:09,869
Thanks, Queen.

347
00:24:09,872 --> 00:24:11,425
Where are the rest of the guards?

348
00:24:11,427 --> 00:24:13,260
A few of them made it to the panic room.

349
00:24:13,262 --> 00:24:15,729
Some were taken to the mess hall.

350
00:24:15,731 --> 00:24:17,264
Diaz set the inmates loose.

351
00:24:17,266 --> 00:24:20,000
He convinced them to
gather up the guards.

352
00:24:20,002 --> 00:24:24,271
Listen, a few of my
buddies have already died.

353
00:24:24,273 --> 00:24:28,475
It's like Diaz is
killing them for sport.

354
00:24:28,477 --> 00:24:31,411
How many inmates in the mess hall?

355
00:24:31,413 --> 00:24:33,113
Last I heard, around 30.

356
00:24:33,115 --> 00:24:34,211
You good to walk?

357
00:24:34,214 --> 00:24:35,479
Yeah, I'm good.

358
00:24:35,482 --> 00:24:36,783
All right.

359
00:24:36,785 --> 00:24:38,051
Take them to the panic room,

360
00:24:38,053 --> 00:24:40,086
and I'll meet you at the commissary.

361
00:24:40,088 --> 00:24:41,474
Not the time for a snack.

362
00:24:41,477 --> 00:24:43,588
If we're gonna fight our
way through 30 inmates,

363
00:24:43,591 --> 00:24:45,158
we're gonna need weapons.

364
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,851
I really, really need to talk to you.

365
00:25:20,162 --> 00:25:22,696
Oh, good. You're awake.

366
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:26,201
I'm sorry about the sedative.

367
00:25:26,204 --> 00:25:28,065
I was just trying to get your attention.

368
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,701
It's okay. I... I understand, Stanley.

369
00:25:30,704 --> 00:25:31,838
I was just, um...

370
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:36,709
Busy trying to stop Diaz from
killing everyone in the prison,

371
00:25:36,712 --> 00:25:38,161
you know?

372
00:25:38,164 --> 00:25:42,648
So, honestly, Stanley, I
think I could use your help.

373
00:25:42,651 --> 00:25:43,896
Really?

374
00:25:43,899 --> 00:25:45,317
Yeah. Really.

375
00:25:46,747 --> 00:25:48,588
Just, why don't you untie me,

376
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:53,185
and we'll make a plan and
you can be my sidekick?

377
00:25:53,188 --> 00:25:54,995
Ohh! Heh.

378
00:25:54,997 --> 00:25:56,966
Actually, I already have a plan.

379
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,217
You know how to get out of here

380
00:25:59,219 --> 00:26:00,484
through the morgue, right?

381
00:26:00,487 --> 00:26:03,568
So why don't we escape this place,

382
00:26:03,571 --> 00:26:05,065
you... you and me?

383
00:26:05,068 --> 00:26:08,275
Yeah, we could, but
what about Diaz, right?

384
00:26:08,277 --> 00:26:09,724
Who cares about Diaz?

385
00:26:09,727 --> 00:26:11,745
These people deserve whatever
he's gonna do to them.

386
00:26:11,747 --> 00:26:13,013
You know that.

387
00:26:13,015 --> 00:26:14,314
Yeah. I...

388
00:26:14,316 --> 00:26:16,583
I can't leave all these people to die.

389
00:26:25,561 --> 00:26:28,201
You were gonna leave me.

390
00:26:31,076 --> 00:26:32,542
You were gonna abandon me

391
00:26:32,545 --> 00:26:34,036
to brick and Sampson,

392
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:36,216
and I shouldn't even be in here.

393
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:39,071
I did nothing wrong.

394
00:26:39,074 --> 00:26:41,074
Hey, come on.

395
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:45,622
It was just because

396
00:26:45,625 --> 00:26:49,482
you were going to attack me. Okay?

397
00:26:49,484 --> 00:26:50,849
Why would I attack you?

398
00:26:50,852 --> 00:26:53,119
Because you're the Green Arrow,

399
00:26:53,121 --> 00:26:54,654
and you fight bad guys,

400
00:26:54,656 --> 00:26:56,389
and you think I'm a bad guy.

401
00:26:56,391 --> 00:26:57,657
And you just think

402
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:00,038
that I'm what everyone says that I am.

403
00:27:00,041 --> 00:27:01,440
How could I?

404
00:27:01,443 --> 00:27:03,797
I don't... I don't know what people say.

405
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:06,066
That I'm a killer,

406
00:27:06,068 --> 00:27:09,002
that I'm a monster,

407
00:27:09,004 --> 00:27:12,005
that everything I did,
everything I did...

408
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:13,646
That whole Dunbar thing.

409
00:27:13,649 --> 00:27:15,941
It was just like the Dunbar thing. I...

410
00:27:15,944 --> 00:27:20,013
I didn't have a choice!
I didn't have a choice!

411
00:27:20,015 --> 00:27:22,282
And all those people had it coming.

412
00:27:22,284 --> 00:27:24,918
You killed other people before Dunbar?

413
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,921
Honestly, what you and
I do is not so different,

414
00:27:27,923 --> 00:27:29,255
right?

415
00:27:29,257 --> 00:27:34,810
So, like, we make such a great team.

416
00:27:34,813 --> 00:27:36,638
So why don't we just get out of here,

417
00:27:36,641 --> 00:27:38,430
maybe we could work together again?

418
00:27:38,433 --> 00:27:41,101
Oh!

419
00:27:42,371 --> 00:27:44,137
Why'd you do that?

420
00:27:59,138 --> 00:28:00,834
What the hell took you so long?

421
00:28:00,837 --> 00:28:03,071
It's a long story.

422
00:28:03,074 --> 00:28:04,940
How are Felton and Miller?

423
00:28:04,943 --> 00:28:06,960
They're safe.

424
00:28:08,316 --> 00:28:09,716
I can't believe

425
00:28:09,719 --> 00:28:12,765
I'm working with the Green Arrow.

426
00:28:12,768 --> 00:28:15,702
You aren't.

427
00:28:15,704 --> 00:28:19,873
Hey, maybe... maybe
prison has changed me,

428
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:21,808
compromised my judgment of people.

429
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:23,543
You sure that's a bad thing?

430
00:28:23,545 --> 00:28:25,645
Look...

431
00:28:27,883 --> 00:28:29,149
No offense.

432
00:28:29,151 --> 00:28:30,583
Okay.

433
00:28:30,585 --> 00:28:33,820
But the old Green Arrow,
he wasn't the best.

434
00:28:33,822 --> 00:28:35,855
He saw the world in black and white,

435
00:28:35,857 --> 00:28:37,885
but now you... You know

436
00:28:37,888 --> 00:28:39,559
there's gray out there, too.

437
00:28:41,029 --> 00:28:43,530
Maybe that makes you a better hero.

438
00:28:48,537 --> 00:28:50,870
And I know it's bad for you,

439
00:28:50,872 --> 00:28:52,672
but do you really think
you're gonna stop Diaz

440
00:28:52,674 --> 00:28:54,080
with a can of soda?

441
00:28:54,083 --> 00:28:56,710
We're about to find out.

442
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:42,479
Are you planning some
kind of light show?

443
00:29:42,481 --> 00:29:44,481
Something like that.

444
00:29:44,483 --> 00:29:46,216
It's nice to know someone hates Queen

445
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:49,286
as much as I do.

446
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:52,489
If it wasn't for him, I'd
still be running Star City.

447
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:54,124
Yeah, me, too.

448
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:57,494
He's a cockroach. He refuses to die.

449
00:29:57,496 --> 00:30:00,130
Diaz!

450
00:30:10,055 --> 00:30:12,576
Look who decided to come to my party.

451
00:30:12,578 --> 00:30:16,046
Let those guards go.

452
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,217
I told you...

453
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:26,756
The only thing I wanted
was to see you suffer...

454
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:30,160
Before you die.

455
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:33,694
You're not gonna get what you want.

456
00:30:33,697 --> 00:30:34,996
No?

457
00:30:36,735 --> 00:30:39,336
Uh!

458
00:30:42,107 --> 00:30:46,009
Ooh. I've been waiting to do that

459
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:48,678
for a long time.

460
00:30:50,916 --> 00:30:53,183
You get your shots in while you can

461
00:30:53,185 --> 00:30:55,552
because I'm gonna see to it

462
00:30:55,554 --> 00:30:58,121
that you spend the rest of your life

463
00:30:58,123 --> 00:31:01,391
eating your meals in
a spot just like this.

464
00:31:01,393 --> 00:31:02,486
I promised myself

465
00:31:02,489 --> 00:31:04,560
I'm never gonna die in prison.

466
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:07,230
And I'm gonna take you with me.

467
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:09,399
Oh, you sure about that?

468
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,702
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah...

469
00:31:38,413 --> 00:31:39,612
Queen!

470
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:02,552
Queen!

471
00:32:02,554 --> 00:32:07,590
Calling for help won't save you!

472
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:12,262
This place...

473
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:14,631
Is gonna be ash

474
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:18,802
long before anyone gets here.

475
00:33:01,268 --> 00:33:03,045
Come on.

476
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:05,682
- Get up! Get up! Come on!
- Let's go. Go! Go! Go! Go!

477
00:33:05,684 --> 00:33:07,550
Get going.

478
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,363
What the hell happened?

479
00:33:12,366 --> 00:33:13,857
Diaz has some sort of device.

480
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:15,658
It must have triggered
an electrical fire.

481
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,894
The whole place is gonna go up.

482
00:33:17,896 --> 00:33:20,048
You need to get them
to the secure courtyard.

483
00:33:20,051 --> 00:33:21,183
What about you?

484
00:33:21,186 --> 00:33:22,519
I'm going after Diaz.

485
00:33:22,522 --> 00:33:26,046
You'll need these. No half-measures.

486
00:34:04,486 --> 00:34:05,919
Just the two of us?

487
00:34:14,196 --> 00:34:16,730
Aah! Uh! Uh!

488
00:34:25,207 --> 00:34:27,341
Hyah!

489
00:34:57,773 --> 00:35:00,774
I'm a lot stronger now.

490
00:35:09,884 --> 00:35:13,352
Uh! Ohh!

491
00:35:13,355 --> 00:35:16,956
Uh! Uh!

492
00:35:16,958 --> 00:35:20,093
Prison's made you weak.

493
00:35:37,312 --> 00:35:41,147
Come on. Get up.

494
00:35:41,149 --> 00:35:44,417
Yeah. Yeah.

495
00:36:00,881 --> 00:36:03,815
You're not surviving this.

496
00:36:11,346 --> 00:36:15,766
You just don't know
when to quit, do you?

497
00:36:17,529 --> 00:36:19,132
I guess what you and Felicity have

498
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,468
in common, huh?

499
00:36:20,471 --> 00:36:22,055
Don't you say her name.

500
00:36:27,832 --> 00:36:30,999
Felicity.

501
00:36:31,002 --> 00:36:35,934
Do you know she tried to kill me?

502
00:36:35,937 --> 00:36:39,939
She put a gun right to my face.

503
00:36:39,941 --> 00:36:42,342
She was about to pull the trigger.

504
00:36:42,344 --> 00:36:45,024
I don't believe you. That's not her.

505
00:36:47,023 --> 00:36:49,056
It is now.

506
00:38:16,671 --> 00:38:19,239
Arrow's little sidekick.

507
00:38:19,241 --> 00:38:22,642
How did you find out
about this place, Dover?

508
00:38:24,246 --> 00:38:26,880
I could ask you the same question.

509
00:38:29,417 --> 00:38:32,118
Well, the only way out of this place is

510
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,653
through the morgue.

511
00:38:33,655 --> 00:38:36,133
But you don't have to be dead.

512
00:38:49,437 --> 00:38:51,430
Actually, I think you do.

513
00:38:54,709 --> 00:38:57,310
You shouldn't have been so mean to me.

514
00:39:26,606 --> 00:39:28,005
Turner...

515
00:39:36,885 --> 00:39:38,430
Thanks.

516
00:39:38,433 --> 00:39:39,929
For what?

517
00:39:39,932 --> 00:39:45,001
Without you, we would all be dead.

518
00:41:05,282 --> 00:41:09,399
