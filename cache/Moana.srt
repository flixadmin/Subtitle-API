1
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,690
<i>In the beginning...</i>

2
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,684
<i>there was only ocean...</i>

3
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,811
<i>until the mother island emerged.</i>

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,809
<i>Te Fiti.</i>

5
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,206
<i>Her heart held the greatest power
ever known.</i>

6
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:13,330
<i>It could create life itself.</i>

7
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,724
<i>And Te Fiti shared it with the world.</i>

8
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,366
<i>But in time...</i>

9
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,564
<i>some began to seek Te Fiti's heart.</i>

10
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,848
<i>They believed
if they could possess it...</i>

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,641
<i>the great power of creation
would be theirs.</i>

12
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,167
<i>And one day...</i>

13
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,326
<i>the most daring of them</i> all...

14
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,849
<i>voyaged across the vast ocean
to take it.</i>

15
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:47,041
<i>He was a demigod of the wind and sea.</i>

16
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,084
<i>He was a warrior.</i>

17
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,565
<i>A trickster.</i>

18
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,247
<i>A shapeshifter who
could change form...</i>

19
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:01,045
<i>with the power of his magical fish hook.</i>

20
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,370
<i>And his name...</i>

21
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,407
<i>was Maui.</i>

22
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,408
<i>But without her heart,
Te Fiti began to crumble...</i>

23
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,325
<i>giving birth to a terrible darkness.</i>

24
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,364
<i>Maui tried to escape...</i>

25
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,924
<i>but was confronted by another
who sought the heart.</i>

26
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,444
<i>Te Kā!</i>

27
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,604
<i>A demon of earth and fire.</i>

28
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,130
<i>Maui was struck from the sky...</i>

29
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,681
<i>never to be seen again.</i>

30
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,968
<i>And his magical fish hook
and the heart of Te Fiti...</i>

31
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,930
<i>were lost to the sea.</i>

32
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,250
Where, even now...

33
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,368
1,000 years later...

34
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:25,126
Te Kā and the demons of the deep...

35
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,282
still hunt for the heart.

36
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,805
Hiding in a darkness
that will continue to spread...

37
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,247
chasing away our fish...

38
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,649
draining the life
from island after island...

39
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,043
until every one of us is devoured...

40
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,891
by the bloodthirsty jaws...

41
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,805
of inescapable death!

42
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,650
But one day...

43
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,802
the heart will be found...

44
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,083
by someone who will journey
beyond our reef...

45
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,571
find Maui...

46
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,848
deliver him across the great ocean...

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,162
to restore Te Fiti's heart...

48
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,004
and save us all.

49
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,724
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Thank you, Mother. That's enough.

50
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,767
Papa.

51
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,683
No one goes outside the reef.

52
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,923
We are safe here.
There is no darkness.

53
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:17,844
There are no monsters.

54
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,801
Monsters!

55
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,008
There's no monsters, no monsters...
It's the darkness!

56
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,206
No, there is nothing beyond our reef,
but storms and rough seas.

57
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,486
I'm gonna throw up.

58
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,802
As long as we stay
on our very safe island...

59
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,806
...we'll be fine.

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,445
The legends are true.

61
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,204
Someone will have to go.

62
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,528
Mother, Motunui is paradise.

63
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,371
Who would want to go anywhere else?

64
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,728
Shoo, shoo!

65
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,726
Moana!

66
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,062
There you are, Moana.

67
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:20,850
What are you doing?
You scared me.

68
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,644
What? I wanna's go back.

69
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,406
I know, I know.
But you don't go out there.

70
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,526
It's dangerous.

71
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,521
Moana, come on.

72
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,722
Let's go back to the village.

73
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,767
You are the next great chief
of our people.

74
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,924
And you will do wondrous
things, my little minnow.

75
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,491
Oh, yes. But first, you must learn
where you're meant to be.

76
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,324

There will come a time...

130
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,681

Fixed!

162
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,926
Not the fronds.

163
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,248
Wind shifted the post.
Ah!

164
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,365
Mmm! That's good pork!

165
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,483
Oh! I didn't mean... I wasn't...

166
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,645
What?
They're calling me, so I gotta... Bye!

167
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,325
Ow! Ow! Ow!

168
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,686
You're doing great.

169
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,251
Is it done yet?

170
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,764
So close.

171
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,562
I'm curious about that chicken
eating the rock.

172
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,641
He seems to lack the basic intelligence
required for pretty much everything.

173
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,724
Should we maybe just cook him?

174
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,123
Sometimes our strengths lie
beneath the surface.

175
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,007
Far beneath in some cases.

176
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,367
But I'm sure there's more to Heihei

177
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,646
than meets the eye.

178
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,761
It's the harvest.

179
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,329
This morning, I was
husking the coconuts and...

180
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,127
Well...

181
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,167
we should clear the diseased trees
and we will start a new grove.

182
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,241
There.

183
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,046
Thanks, Moana.

184
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,202
She's doing great.

185
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,566
This suits you.

186
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,761
Chief?

187
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,607
There's something you need to see.

188
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,610
Our traps in the east lagoon...

189
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,923
they're pulling up less and less fish.

190
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,767
Then we'll rotate the fishing grounds.

191
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,088
Uh, we have. There's no fish.

192
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,443
Oh. Then we'll fish
the far side of the island.

193
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,647
We tried.

194
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,086
The windward side.

195
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,767
And the leeward side, the shallows,
the channel.

196
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,605
We've tried the whole lagoon.

197
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,122
They're just gone.

198
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,409
Have you tried using a different bait?

199
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,971
I don't think it's the bait.

200
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,606
There's no fish.

201
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,485
It seems like it's
getting worse and worse.

202
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,604
Of course, I understand
you have reason for concern.

203
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:25,851
I will talk to the council.
I'm sure we...

204
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,844
What if we fish beyond the reef?

205
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,123
No one goes beyond the reef.

206
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,760
I know. But if there are
no fish in the lagoon...

207
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,849
Moana.
And there's a whole ocean.

208
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,645
We have one rule.

209
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,961
An old rule, when there were fish.

210
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,084
A rule that keeps us safe...
But Dad, I...

211
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,171
...instead of endangering our people
so you can run right back to the water.

212
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,366
Every time I think you're past this...

213
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,281
No one goes beyond the reef!

214
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,003
Well, it's not like you said it
in front of your dad.

215
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,170
Standing on a boat.

216
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,164
I didn't say go beyond the reef,
because I want to be on the ocean.

217
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,322
But you still do.

218
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,206
He's hard on you because...
Because he doesn't get me.

219
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,971
Because he was you.

220
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,649
Drawn to the ocean.

221
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,165
<i>Down by the shore.</i>

222
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,964
<i>He took a canoe, Moana.</i>

223
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,600
<i>He crossed the reef...</i>

224
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,847
<i>and found an unforgiving sea.</i>

225
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,084
<i>Waves like mountains.</i>

226
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,363
<i>His best friend begged
to be on that boat.</i>

227
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,121
<i>Your dad couldn't save him.</i>

228
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,528
He's hoping he can save you.

229
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,370
Sometimes...

230
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:59,445
who we wish we were,
what we wish we could do...

231
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,248
it's just not meant to be.

We're okay, Pua.

I can do this.

277
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,885
There's more fish beyond the reef.

278
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,807
There's more beyond the reef.

279
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,690
Not so bad.

280
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,442
Pua!

281
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,804
Whatever just happened...

282
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,291
blame it on the pig.

283
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,687
Gramma.

284
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,130
Are you gonna tell Dad?

285
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,723
I'm his mom.
I don't have to tell him anything.

286
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,726
He was right.

287
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,482
About going out there.

288
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,003
It's time to put my stone
on the mountain.

289
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:44,164
Okay. Well, then, head on back.

290
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,684
Put that stone up there.

291
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,284
Why aren't you trying
to talk me out of it?

292
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,127
You said that's what you wanted.

293
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,081
It is.

294
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,842
When I die...

295
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,529
I'm going to come back as one of these.

296
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:10,810
Or I chose the wrong tattoo.

297
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,644
Why are you acting weird?

298
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,328
I'm the village crazy lady.
That's my job.

299
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,641
If there's something you
want to tell me, just tell me!

300
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,649
Is there something you wanna tell me?

301
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,044
Is there something you want to hear?

302
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,884
You've been told
all our people's stories...

303
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,404
but one.

304
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,845
What is this place?

305
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:44,490
Do you really think
our ancestors stayed within the reef?

306
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,402
Ooh!

307
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,810
What's in there?

308
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,483
The answer to the question
you keep asking yourself.

309
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,651

We were voyagers.

332
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,686
We were voyagers!

333
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,721
We were voyagers! We were voyagers!

334
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,649
We were voyagers!

335
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,605
Why'd we stop?

336
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,806
Maui.

337
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,007
<i>When he stole from the
mother island, darkness fell.</i>

338
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,484
<i>Te Kā awoke.</i>

339
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,403
<i>Monsters lurked and
boats stopped coming back.</i>

340
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:31,846
<i>To protect our people,
the ancient chiefs forbid voyaging...</i>

341
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,845
and now we have forgotten who we are.

342
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,926
And the darkness
has continued to spread...

343
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,204
chasing away our fish...

344
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,130
draining the life...

345
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,888
from island after island.

346
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,123
Our island.

347
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,563
But, one day...

348
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,850
someone will journey
beyond our reef, find Maui...

349
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,924
deliver him across the great ocean...

350
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,447
to restore the heart of Te Fiti.

351
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,203
I was there that day.

352
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,210
The ocean chose you.

353
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,122
I thought it was a dream.

354
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,764
Nope!

355
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,446
Our ancestors
believed Maui lies there...

356
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,364
at the bottom of his hook.

357
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,650
Follow it, and you will find him.

358
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,247
But why would it choose me?

359
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,483
I don't even know
how to make it past the reef.

360
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,248
But I know who does!

361
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,561
The crops are turning black.

362
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,521
What about the fish?

363
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,364
This is happening all over the island.

364
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,965
Please, please settle down.
What are you going to do?

365
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,809
We will dig new fields.
We will find a way to...

366
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,406
We can stop the darkness!
Save our island!

367
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,125
There's a cavern of boats.

368
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,811
Huge canoes.

369
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,561
We can take them, find Maui,
make him restore the heart.

370
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,203
We were voyagers.
We can voyage again!

371
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,044
You told me to help our people.

372
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,441
This is how we help our people.

373
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,881
Dad?

374
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:32,961
What are you doing?

375
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,641
I should've burned those boats
a long time ago!

376
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,847
No! Don't!

377
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,571
We have to find Maui.
We have to restore the heart!

378
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,041
There is no heart!

379
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,884
This is just a rock!

380
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,961
No!

381
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,482
Chief! It's your mother!

382
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,166
Mother...

383
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,805
What can be done?

384
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,121
Go.

385
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,010
Gramma.

386
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,727
Go.

387
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,726
Not now. I can't.

388
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,201
You must!

389
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,763
The ocean chose you.

390
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,400
Follow the fish hook.

391
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,601
Gramma...

392
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,842
And when you find Maui...

393
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,841
you grab him by the ear. You say...

394
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,244
"I am Moana of Motunui.

395
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,848
"You will board my boat...

396
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,402
"sail across the sea...

397
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:11,565
"and restore the heart of Te Fiti."

398
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,727
I can't leave you.

399
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:21,411
There is nowhere you could go
that I won't be with you.

400
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,771

00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,290
sail across the sea
and restore the heart of Te Fiti.

421

I am Moana...

of Motu...

423
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,246
...nui.

424
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,881
Heihei?

425
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:07,450
It's okay. You're all right.

426
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,241
See?

427
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,450
There we go. Nice water.

428
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,126
The ocean is a friend of mine.

429
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,446
Heihei?

430
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,761
Heihei!

431
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,841
Stay!

432
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,684
Okay. Next stop, Maui.

433
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,371
I am Moana of Motunui.

434
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,690
You will board my boat...

435
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,683
sail... across the sea...

436
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,968
and restore the heart of Te Fiti.

437
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,123
I am Moana of Motu...

438
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,531
Board my boat!

439
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,561
Oh, no.

440
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,569
No, no, no!

441
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,006
Ocean...

442
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,091
can I get a little help?

443
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,686
No, no.

444
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,161
Please.

445
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,481
Come on!

446
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,291
Help me!

447
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,761
Please!

448
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,561
Whew!

449
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,767
Um...

450
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,006
What?

451
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,970
I said help me!

452
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:55,282
And wrecking my boat?

453
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,449
Not helping!

454
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:02,044
Fish pee in you all day!

455
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,326
So...

456
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,361
Maui?

457
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,840
Maui!

458
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,606
Maui, demigod of the wind and sea...

459
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,489
I am Moana of Motunui.

460
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,210
You will board my boat.

461
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,283
No. You will board my boat.

462
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:41,205
Yeah. I am Moana of Motunui.

463
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,126
You will board my...

464
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,362
Boat! A boat!

465
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,205
The gods have given me a...

466
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,164
Maui, shapeshifter...

467
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,449
demigod of the wind and sea...

468
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,604
I am Moana of...
Hero of men.

469
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,205
What?

470
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,806
It's actually, Maui, shapeshifter,
demigod of the wind and sea...

471
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,161
hero of men.

472
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,244
I interrupted.
From the top. Hero of men. Go.

473
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,201
I am...

474
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,521
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

475
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,002
And women. Men and women.

476
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,161
Both. All.

477
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,925
Not a guy, girl thing.

478
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,844
You know, Maui is a hero to all.

479
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,161
You're doing great.

480
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,050
What? No! I'm here to...

481
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,611
Of course.

482
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,921
Yes, yes, yes.

483
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,886
Maui always has time for his fans.

484
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,446
When you use a bird to write with...

485
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,365
it's called tweeting.

486
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,845
I know, not every day you
get a chance to meet your hero.

487
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,844
You are not my hero.

488
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,566
And I'm not here
so you can sign my oar!

489
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,371
I'm here 'cause
you stole the heart of Te Fiti!

490
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,568
And you will board my boat...

491
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,929
and sail across the sea and put it back!

492
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,126
Um...

493
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,965
Yeah, it almost sounded
like you don't like me...

494
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,043
which is impossible because...

495
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,009
I got stuck here for 1,000 years...

496
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,401
trying to get the heart
as a gift for you mortals.

497
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,888
So you could have the power
to create life itself.

498
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,442
Yeah. So, what I believe
you were trying to say...

499
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,601
is "thank you."

500
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,250
"Thank you?"
You're welcome.

501
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,401
What? No, no, no!

502
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,891
I didn't... I wasn't...

503
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,087
Why would I ever say that?

504
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,486

No. I'm not going to Te Fiti
with some kid.

573
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,441
I'm going to get my hook.

574
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,723
You have yours and
I'm not Maui without mine.

575
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,126
Okay, talk to the back.

576
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,081
Boat snack.

577
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,721
Good riddance,
you filthy pile of pebbles.

578
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,561
Oh, no, no, no.
Don't look at me like that.

579
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,291
It's a beautiful cave.
She's gonna love it.

580
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,043
And I'm going to love you in ma belly.

581
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,608
Now, let's fatten you up, drumstick.

582
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,167
I could watch that all day.

583
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,964
Okay. Enjoy the island.

584
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,481
Maui, out.

585
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,085
No! Stop!

586
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,163
Hey! You have to put back the heart!

587
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,410
Did not see that coming.

588
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:13,603
I am Moana of Motunui.

589
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,091
This is my canoe...

590
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,850
and you will journey to...

591
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,730
All right, get over it.
We gotta move.

592
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:24,921
And she's back.

593
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,647
I am Moana of Motunui...

594
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,011
It was Moana, right?

595
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,206
Yes.

596
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,881
And you will restore the heart!

597
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,361
All right. I'm out.

598
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,886
Oh, come on!

599
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,564
What is your problem?

600
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,049
Are you afraid of it?

601
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,725
No! No.

602
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,290
I'm not afraid.

603
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,242
Stay out of it or you're
sleeping in my armpit.

604
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,401
You, stop it.

605
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:16,245
That is not a heart. It is a curse.

606
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,528
The second I took it,
I got blasted outta the sky...

607
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:19,886
and I lost my hook.

608
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,201
Get it away from me.

609
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,051
Get this away?

610
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,169
Hey, hey, hey! I'm a demigod, okay?

611
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,004
Stop that. I will smite you!

612
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,844
You wanna get smote?

613
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,001
Smotten?

614
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,680
Listen, that thing doesn't give you
power to create life...

615
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,569
it's a homing beacon of death.

616
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:38,007
If you don't put it away,
bad things are gonna come for it.

617
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,169
Come for this? The heart?

618
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,407
You mean this heart right here?

619
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,481
Don't, you can't
raise your voice like that!

620
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,045
Come and get it!

621
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,446
You are gonna get us killed!

622
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,129
No, I'm gonna get us to Te Fiti,
so you can put it back.

623
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,281
Thank you.

624
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,601
You're welcome.

625
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:57,601
Kakamora.

626
00:44:57,760 --> 00:44:59,046
Kaka-what?

627
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,611
Murdering little pirates.

628
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:04,211
Wonder what they're here for.

629
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,927
They're kinda cute.

630
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:29,681
Ocean!

631
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,649
Do something! Help us!

632
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:34,247
The ocean doesn't help you,
you help yourself!

633
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,925
Tighten the halyard. Bind the stays!

634
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,091
You can't sail?

635
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,606
I, uh...

636
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,330
I am self-taught.

637
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,848
Can't you shapeshift or something?

638
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,047
Do you see my hook?

639
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,804
No magic hook, no magic powers!

640
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,568
Their boat is turning into more boats!

641
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,686
Yep, <i>I</i> just did that.

642
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,521
No, no!

643
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,604
Heihei!

644
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:13,046
Maui!

645
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,201
They took the heart!

646
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:17,761
That's a chicken.

647
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,922
The heart is in the...

648
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,001
We have to get him back!

649
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,561
Maui!

650
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,124
Cheeeehoooo!

651
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,884
There! Right there!

652
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,041
You're turning?

653
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,326
What are you doing?

654
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,606
Escaping!

655
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:48,967
The heart!

656
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,930
Forget it! You'll never get it back!

657
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:53,082
Besides, you got a better one.

658
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,161
Hey!

659
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,241
What am I gonna steer with?

660
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:58,130
They're just gonna kill ya!

661
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:03,561
Coconuts.

662
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:47,646
Got it!

663
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,401
Hey!

664
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,401
Yeah!

665
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,481
We did it!

666
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,008
Congratulations
on not being dead, girlie.

667
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:16,520
You surprise me.

668
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,928
But I'm still not taking that thing back.

669
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:23,490
You wanna get to Te Fiti you gotta
go through a whole ocean of bad.

670
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:24,966
Not to mention Te Kā.

671
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:27,885
Lava monster?

672
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,044
Ever defeat a lava monster?

673
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,927
No. Have you?

674
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:43,649
I'm not going on a suicide mission
with some mortal.

675
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,051
You can't restore the heart without me...

676
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,964
and me says no.

677
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,410
I'm getting my hook.

678
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,401
End of discussion.

679
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,402
You'd be a hero.

680
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,802
That's what you're all about, right?

681
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,804
Little girl, I am a hero.

682
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:11,450
Maybe you were.

683
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,726
But now...

684
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,804
now you're just the guy
who stole the heart of Te Fiti.

685
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:18,281
The guy who cursed the world.

686
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,011
You're no one's hero.

687
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,360
No one?

688
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,041
But...

689
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:35,210
put this back...

690
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:37,124
save the world...

691
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:39,283
you'd be everyone's hero.

692
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:47,129
Maui! Maui! Maui!

693
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:49,484
You're so amazing!

694
00:50:50,040 --> 00:50:52,771
We'd never make it without my hook.
Not past Te Kā.

695
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,001
Then we get your hook.

696
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:57,887
We get your hook, take out Te Kā,
restore the heart.

697
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,691
Unless you don't wanna be...

698
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:03,969
Maui, demigod of the wind and sea.

699
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,650
Hero to...

700
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,241
all.

701
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,490
First, we get my hook.

702
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,245
Then save the world.

703
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,321
Deal?

704
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,441
Deal.

705
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:21,887
Worth a shot.

706
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,724
Okay, we go east.

707
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:27,041
To the lair of Tamatoa.

708
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:32,687
If anyone has my hook,
it's that beady-eyed bottom-feeder.

709
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,565
Teach me to sail.

710
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:52,242
My job is to deliver Maui
across the great ocean.

711
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,401
I should...

712
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,683
I should be sailing.

713
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,883
It's called wayfinding, princess.

714
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,409
And it's not just sails and knots...

715
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,206
it's seeing where you're going
in your mind.

716
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,409
Knowing where you are...

717
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,171
by knowing where you've been.

718
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,687
Okay, first, I'm not a princess.

719
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,281
I am the daughter of the chief.

720
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,641
Same difference.
No.

721
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,451
If you wear a dress,
and you have an animal sidekick...

722
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:17,726
you're a princess.

723
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,081
You are not a wayfinder.

724
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:22,689
You will never be a wayfinder,
you will never be a...

725
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:30,327
Really? Blow dart in my butt cheek?

726
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:38,331
You are a bad person.

727
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,250
If you can talk, you can teach.

728
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:41,401
Wayfinding.

729
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,409
Lesson one. Hit it.

730
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,246
Pull the sheet.

731
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,650
Not the sheet.

732
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:51,801
No.

733
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:52,881
Nope.

734
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,008
Nope. No.

735
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,769
Tried that one already.

736
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:04,920
You're measuring the stars,
not giving the sky a high-five.

737
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:09,210
If the current's warm,
you're going the right way.

738
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,610
It's cold.

739
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,411
Wait, it's getting warmer.

740
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:19,531
Aah! That is disgusting!
What is wrong with you?

741
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,491
We're here?

742
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:40,681
See, told you I could do it!

743
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,405
Motunui?

744
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,204
I'm home?

745
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,529
Moana!
Dad?

746
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,004
Moana!

747
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,321
Mom?

748
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:04,886
Help!

749
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:07,761
No!

750
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,406
Moana!

751
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,004
Enjoy your beauty rest?

752
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:16,851
You know,
a real wayfinder never sleeps...

753
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,651
so they actually get
where they need to go.

754
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,691
Muscle up, buttercup.

755
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,810
We're here.

756
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:27,482
You're sure this guy's gonna
have your hook?

757
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,888
Tamatoa? Oh, he'll have it.

758
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:34,086
He's a scavenger. Collects stuff.
Thinks it makes him look cool.

759
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:35,161
Ah!

760
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:37,769
And for Tamatoa, trust me...

761
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:40,486
my hook is the coolest collectible.

762
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,564
And he lives up there?

763
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:46,561
No,no,no.

764
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,171
That's just the entrance...

765
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,527
to Lalotai.

766
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,961
Lalotai?

767
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,884
Realm of monsters?

768
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,409
We're going to the realm of monsters?

769
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,047
We? No. Me.

770
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,649
You are gonna stay here
with the other chicken.

771
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:06,124
That's what I'm talking about.
Gimme some.

772
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,687
Come on. That was a good one.
How do you not get it?

773
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,047
I called her a chicken,
there's a chicken on the boat.

774
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:13,885
I know she's human,
but that's not the...

775
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,605
You know what? Forget it. Forget it!

776
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,250
I'm not explaining it to you.

777
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,050
'Cause then it's not funny.

778
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,882
So, daughter of the chief...

779
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,530
I thought you stayed in the village.

780
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,364
You know, kissing babies and things.

781
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,283
Hey, I'm just trying to understand...

782
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:43,881
why your people decided to send...

783
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,122
How do I phrase this? You.

784
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:49,563
My people didn't send me.

785
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:50,881
The ocean did.

786
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,280
The ocean?

787
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,441
Makes sense.

788
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,204
You're what, eight? Can't sail.

789
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,566
Obvious choice.

790
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:00,122
It chose me for a reason.

791
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:01,850
If the ocean's so smart...

792
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:05,123
why didn't it just take the heart
back to Te Fiti itself?

793
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:07,044
Or bring me my hook?

794
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,441
The ocean's straight up kooky-dooks.

795
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:12,324
But I'm sure it's not wrong about you.

796
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,407
You're the Chosen One!

797
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:34,402
The ocean chose you for a reason.

798
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:37,166
If you start singing,
I'm gonna throw up.

799
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:40,008
So, not seeing an entrance.

800
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,329
Yes, because it only appears...

801
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,323
after a human sacrifice.

802
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:47,691
Kidding.

803
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,120
So serious.

804
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:13,841
Don't worry...

805
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,208
it's a lot farther down than it looks.

806
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:17,361
Cheeeehoooo!

807
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:25,570
I am still falling!

808
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:28,886
You can do this.

809
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:30,686
Go!

810
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,445
And he sticks the landing.

811
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:55,721
Huh?

812
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,121
What? Dum-dum, she's not even here.

813
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:01,601
No mortal's gonna jump
into the realm of...

814
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:02,807
Huh?

815
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:09,003
Well, she's dead.

816
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,649
Okay, let's get my hook.

817
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:23,931
Ew! Ew, ew, ew, ew.

818
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,802
Maui's fishhook!

819
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,371
Yeah!

820
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,250
Sorry!

821
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,401
I thought you were a monster...

822
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:20,800
But I found your hook.

823
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,122
And, you're right, this Tamatoa guy
really likes his treasure.

824
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,281
Stay!

825
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:26,647
What? No. I'm the one who found...

826
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,330
Listen. For a thousand years...

827
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,687
I've only been thinking of
keeping this hair silky...

828
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:31,921
getting my hook...

829
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,650
and being awesome again.

830
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:36,207
And it's not getting screwed up
by a mortal...

831
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:40,081
who has no business
inside of a monster cave, except...

832
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:43,330
Except...

833
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:44,720
maybe as bait.

834
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,086
Huh?

835
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:47,841
Wow!

836
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,048
The shiny, glittery cave.

837
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,565
And just like me...

838
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:54,371
it is covered in sparkly treasure.

839
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:56,409
Sparkle, sparkle, sparkle.

840
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:58,005
You're not selling it!

841
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:00,083
This is stupid!
I'm just gonna walk up and get it!

842
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:02,726
You go up there, he will kill you.
Just stick to the plan.

843
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:07,241
Oh, when he shows up,
keep him distracted.

844
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:08,890
Make him talk about himself.

845
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:11,208
He loves bragging about
how great he is.

846
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,850
You two must get along swell.

847
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,044
No, not since I ripped off his leg.

848
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,364
You ripped off his...

849
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:18,521
Maui?

850
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,565
What have we here?

851
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:34,246
It's a sparkly, shiny... Wait a minute.

852
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:37,563
Ugh! It's a human!

853
01:00:37,720 --> 01:00:41,406
What are you doing down here,
in the realm of the...

854
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:42,971
Just pick an eye, babe.

855
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:44,764
I can't concentrate
on what I'm saying if you keep...

856
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:47,243
Yeah, pick one, pick one!

857
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,722
You're a funny-looking little thing,
aren't you?

858
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:51,325
Don't! That's my gramma's!

859
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:52,561
"That's my gramma's!"

860
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:53,801
I ate my gramma!

861
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,446
And it took a week,
'cause she was absolutely humongous.

862
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:58,250
Why are you here?

863
01:00:59,440 --> 01:01:00,930
'Cause you're amazing!

864
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:06,405
And we mortals have heard of the tale
of the crab who became a legend!

865
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:09,126
And I just had to know...

866
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:11,851
how you became so...

867
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:14,481
crabulous?

868
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:19,086
Are you just trying to get me
to talk about myself?

869
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:22,124
Because if you are...

870
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:24,368
I will gladly do so.

871
01:01:24,440 --> 01:01:25,441

The heart of Te Fiti.

Oh, you can. You keep surprising me.

for a crustacean.

943
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:06,925
Where is it? Where is it?

944
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:09,164
We gotta go!

945
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:10,841
What about the heart?

946
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:13,480
He can have it. I've got a better one.

Yes, I have the...

948
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:17,321
Wait a minute.

949
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:20,331
I see, she's taken a barnacle
and she's covered it in...

950
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:23,683
bioluminescent algae as a diversion.

951
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,047
Come back here!

952
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:33,841
Cheeeehoooo!

953
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:35,971
Hey!

954
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,690
Did you like the song?

955
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,726
We're alive!

956
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:50,681
Listen...

957
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,803
I appreciate what you did down there.

958
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,121
Mm-hmm.

959
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,247
Took guts.
Mm-hmm.

960
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:56,561
But“
Mm-hmm.

961
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:57,761
I'm sorry.

962
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,969
I'm trying to be sincere for once,
and it feels like you're distracted.

963
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:03,043
No, no. No way!

964
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:03,771
Really?

965
01:06:03,773 --> 01:06:05,487
Because you're looking
at me like I have a...

966
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:09,566
shark head.

967
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:12,883
What? Do you have a shark head?

968
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:14,764
Look, the point is...

969
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:17,804
for a little girl, child, thing,
whatever...

970
01:06:17,960 --> 01:06:20,531
who had no business
being down there...

971
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,450
you did me a solid.

972
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:24,688
But you also almost died.

973
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:26,924
And I couldn't even beat that dumb crab.

974
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:29,241
So, chances of beating Te Kā?

975
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:30,561
Bupkis.

976
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:34,008
We're never making it to Te Fiti.
This mission is cursed.

977
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:35,407
It's not cursed.

978
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:37,121
Shark head.

979
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:40,011
It is not cursed.

980
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:55,161
Cursed.

981
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:01,442
♪ What can I say except ♪

982
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,443
♪ We're dead soon ♪

983
01:07:03,640 --> 01:07:05,130
♪ We're dead soon ♪

984
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:08,083
Can you at least try?

985
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:12,443
Giant hawk.

986
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,408
♪ Hey, it's okay, it's okay
We're dead soon ♪

987
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:20,203
All right, break time's over.

988
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:21,361
Get up.

989
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:23,887
Why? Are you gonna
give me a speech?

990
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:27,806
Tell me I can beat Te Ka
'cause I'm "Maui?"

991
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:30,641
Take a hike, Tiny.

992
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:39,120
How do you get your tattoos?

993
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:41,767
They show up. When I earn them.

994
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:45,564
How'd you earn that one?
What's that for?

995
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:49,042
That's man's discovery of Nunya.

996
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:50,326
What's Nunya?

997
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:51,811
Nunya business.

998
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:54,765
I'll just keep asking.

999
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:58,041
What's it for?

1000
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,842
You need to stop doing that.

1001
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:07,209
Back off.
Just tell me what it is.

1002
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:08,850
I said back off.

1003
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,684
Is it why your hook's not working?

1004
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:29,445
You don't wanna talk, don't talk.

1005
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:31,842
You wanna throw me off the boat...

1006
01:08:32,240 --> 01:08:33,969
throw me off.

1007
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:37,442
You wanna tell me
I don't know what I'm doing...

1008
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:39,564
I know I don't.

1009
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:43,729
I have no idea why the ocean chose me.

1010
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,609
You're right.

1011
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:50,205
But my island is dying...

1012
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:54,044
so I am here.

1013
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:57,087
It's just me and you.

1014
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:59,925
And I want to help...

1015
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:04,404
but I can't if you don't let me.

1016
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:12,331
I wasn't born a demigod.

1017
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,128
I had human parents.

1018
01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:21,451
They took one look and decided...

1019
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,080
they did not want me.

1020
01:09:24,400 --> 01:09:26,528
They threw me into the sea...

1021
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:30,129
like I was nothing.

1022
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:35,127
Somehow, I was found by the gods.

1023
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:36,930
They gave me the hook.

1024
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:38,761
They made me...

1025
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:40,601
Maui.

1026
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:44,645
And back to the humans I went.

1027
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:48,971
I gave them islands, fire, coconuts.

1028
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:52,281
Anything they could ever want.

1029
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:55,287
You took the heart for them.

1030
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,890
You did everything for them.

1031
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:01,523
So they'd love you.

1032
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:05,283
It was never enough.

1033
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:16,728
Maybe the gods found you for a reason.

1034
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:20,043
Maybe the ocean brought you to them...

1035
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:24,330
because it saw someone
who was worthy of being saved.

1036
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:29,167
But the gods aren't the ones
who make you Maui.

1037
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:31,080
You are.

1038
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:42,363
Okay, Okay...

1039
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:45,846
I love you, too, buddy.

1040
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:36,886
Cheeeehoooo!

1041
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:52,801
Yeah!

1042
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:19,651
Next stop, Te Fiti.

1043
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:07,481
What?

1044
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:09,130
I figured it out.

1045
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:14,201
You know, the ocean used to love
when I pulled up islands...

1046
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:18,160
'cause your ancestors
would sail her seas and find 'em.

1047
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:21,770
All those new lands, new villages.

1048
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:24,606
It was the water that connected 'em all.

1049
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,650
And if I were the ocean...

1050
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:30,930
I think I'd be looking for
a curly-haired non-princess...

1051
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:33,483
to start that again.

1052
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:38,043
That is literally the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

1053
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:41,208
Probably should have
saved it for Te Fiti.

1054
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:43,921
I did.

1055
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,922
Moana of Motunui...

1056
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:54,724
I believe you have officially
delivered Maui across the great sea.

1057
01:13:55,840 --> 01:13:58,366
Moana! Moana! Moana!

1058
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:00,609
You're so amazing!

1059
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:03,401
It's time.

1060
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:23,245
Go save the world.

1061
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:26,364
Cheeeehoooo!

1062
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,684
Maui!

1063
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:23,880
What are you doing?

1064
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:25,810
Finding you a better way in!

1065
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:29,209
We won't make it!
Yes, we will!

1066
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:30,486
Turn around!
No!

1067
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:31,766
Moana, stop!

1068
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:32,961
No!

1069
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:02,644
Are you okay?

1070
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:05,201
Maui?

1071
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:14,963
I told you to turn back.

1072
01:16:17,240 --> 01:16:19,004
I thought we could make it.

1073
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:20,401
We?

1074
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:23,962
I thought I could make it.

1075
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:27,046
We can fix it.

1076
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:29,328
It was made by the gods.

1077
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,249
You can't fix it!

1078
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:33,767
Next time we'll be more careful.

1079
01:16:34,040 --> 01:16:36,088
Te Kā was stuck on the barrier islands.

1080
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:38,686
It's lava, it can't go in the water.

1081
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:40,842
We can find a way around.

1082
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:42,843
I'm not going back.

1083
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:45,570
We still have to restore the heart.

1084
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,251
My hook is cracked.

1085
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:49,084
One more hit, and it's over.

1086
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:51,329
Maui, you have to restore the heart.

1087
01:16:51,640 --> 01:16:53,369
Without my hook, I am nothing.

1088
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:54,681
That's not true!

1089
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:57,360
Without my hook, I am nothing!

1090
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:08,160
We are only here...

1091
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:11,484
because you stole the heart
in the first place.

1092
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:15,411
No, we're here because
the ocean told you you're special...

1093
01:17:15,560 --> 01:17:17,369
and you believed it.

1094
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:21,080
I am Moana of Motunui.

1095
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:23,487
You will board my boat...
Goodbye, Moana.

1096
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:24,801
...sail across the sea...

1097
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:26,041
I'm not killing myself...

1098
01:17:26,240 --> 01:17:27,480
so you can prove
you're something you're not!

1099
01:17:27,640 --> 01:17:28,880
...and restore the heart of Te Fiti!

1100
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:32,001
The ocean chose me!

1101
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:34,644
It chose wrong.

1102
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:45,441
Maui!

1103
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:02,920
Why did you bring me here?

1104
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,762
I'm not the right person.

1105
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:15,444
You have to choose someone else.

1106
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,331
Choose someone else.

1107
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:22,451
Please.

1108
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:42,800
No.

1109
01:18:58,680 --> 01:19:01,001
You're a long ways
past the reef.

1110
01:19:02,360 --> 01:19:03,361
Gramma?

1111
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:08,364
Guess I chose the right tattoo.

1112
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:09,841
Gramma!

1113
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:17,568
I tried, Gramma.

1114
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:21,164
I couldn't do it.

1115
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:24,446
It's not your fault.

1116
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:28,366
I never should have put so much
on your shoulders.

1117
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:31,202
If you are ready to go home...

1118
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:34,682
I will be with you.

1119
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:52,890
Why do you hesitate?

1120
01:19:54,280 --> 01:19:55,964
