01:25:53,064 --> 01:25:54,190
(IN ENGLISH)
I'll get you the shot.

827
01:26:03,658 --> 01:26:05,618
(ALL SNARLING)

828
01:26:31,018 --> 01:26:32,019
(BOTH GRUNT)

829
01:26:35,064 --> 01:26:36,065
(LIN GRUNTS)

830
01:26:40,319 --> 01:26:41,611
I've got you.

831
01:26:42,780 --> 01:26:44,782
(BOTH GRUNTING)

832
01:26:54,333 --> 01:26:55,334
(CLATTERING)

833
01:27:59,523 --> 01:28:01,608
So, how's life
without me?

834
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:04,278
A little slow.

835
01:28:07,531 --> 01:28:09,157
You're a hero after all.

836
01:28:09,700 --> 01:28:10,951
Well, it looks that way.

837
01:28:11,035 --> 01:28:13,370
You seem pleased
with yourself.

838
01:28:13,454 --> 01:28:15,873
And what are they giving you
for all of your troubles?

839
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:17,041
A bag of gold?

840
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:19,793
A victory parade
along the top of the Wall?

841
01:28:20,377 --> 01:28:22,295
All the black powder
I can carry.

842
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:25,591
And a cavalry escort
to get me home safely.

843
01:28:26,717 --> 01:28:28,051
Well, congratulations.

844
01:28:28,135 --> 01:28:29,970
Thank you.

845
01:28:30,054 --> 01:28:33,348
So what is this? You're
here to rub my nose in it?

846
01:28:33,557 --> 01:28:34,975
Well, would you
blame me?

847
01:28:35,059 --> 01:28:37,436
The last time I saw you,
you left me for dead.

848
01:28:37,561 --> 01:28:39,479
And the time before that,
I saved your life.

849
01:28:39,563 --> 01:28:40,897
True.

850
01:28:43,234 --> 01:28:45,819
You know, the Emperor
gave me a choice.

851
01:28:45,903 --> 01:28:48,113
I could take
the black powder,

852
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:50,615
or I could take you.

853
01:28:52,451 --> 01:28:54,411
Please tell me
you chose the powder?

854
01:29:01,669 --> 01:29:03,379
I don't even
know you anymore.

855
01:29:04,004 --> 01:29:05,005
(CHUCKLES)

856
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:07,716
The horses are
saddled and waiting.

857
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:10,093
Best we ride
before nightfall.

858
01:29:15,599 --> 01:29:17,267
I'll be inside.

859
01:29:17,351 --> 01:29:19,227
Don't leave
without me.

860
01:29:29,947 --> 01:29:31,114
I came to say goodbye.

861
01:29:33,450 --> 01:29:36,703
I understand
congratulations are in order.

862
01:29:36,871 --> 01:29:39,123
General of the
northwest territory.

863
01:29:39,290 --> 01:29:40,958
That's quite
an honor.

864
01:29:43,460 --> 01:29:45,587
Seems you've made
your choice.

865
01:29:45,713 --> 01:29:46,797
Him?

866
01:29:46,964 --> 01:29:49,841
Believe me, I'm already thinking
about trading him back for the powder.

867
01:29:50,009 --> 01:29:51,969
(CHUCKLES)
TOVAR: I heard that.

868
01:29:57,641 --> 01:30:00,769
Perhaps we were
both wrong.

869
01:30:01,312 --> 01:30:03,981
We are more similar
than I thought.

870
01:30:09,653 --> 01:30:11,363
Thank you, General.

871
01:30:27,129 --> 01:30:28,171
(HORSE GRUNTS)

872
01:30:37,306 --> 01:30:39,349
Are you sure you don't
want to go back?

873
01:30:40,017 --> 01:30:41,018
Of course I do.

874
01:30:42,186 --> 01:30:44,688
I just don't trust you to
make it out of here alone.

875
01:30:44,772 --> 01:30:45,773
