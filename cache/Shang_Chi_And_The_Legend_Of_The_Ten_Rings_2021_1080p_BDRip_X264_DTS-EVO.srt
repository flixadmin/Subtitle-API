1
00:09:41,249 --> 00:09:42,458
Okay.

2
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:45,604
Hello, sir,

3
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,065
welcome to the Fairmont...

4
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:49,567
I'm driving.

5
00:10:49,734 --> 00:10:51,193
No, you're not... Katy.

6
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,237
Hey, hey, get back here.

7
00:10:53,321 --> 00:10:54,363
Give me the key.

8
00:10:55,865 --> 00:10:58,200
Please open the door.

9
00:10:58,284 --> 00:11:00,828
Oh, my God.

10
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,955
- Get out.
- You get in!

11
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,141
Look, if happens to this thing,

12
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:05,166
we're gonna be jobless

13
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,643
and in debt
for the rest of our lives.

14
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:08,753
Oh, come on. Nothing's gonna
happen to this car.

15
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,338
I'm the Asian Jeff Gordon.

16
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:11,672
I don't know who that is.

17
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,632
Most career wins
in all of NASCAR history?

18
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:15,301
Please get out of the car.

19
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,761
Shaun,

20
00:11:16,886 --> 00:11:18,971
we've been friends
for 10 years, okay?

21
00:11:19,138 --> 00:11:21,182
You know I'm not an idiot.

22
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,393
Please, get in. I'll go slow.

23
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:28,689
Katy, watch the...

24
00:11:35,404 --> 00:11:36,405
<i>I knew Katy was trouble</i>

25
00:11:36,489 --> 00:11:37,889
<i>the first day we met
in high school.</i>

26
00:11:38,032 --> 00:11:39,134
I was getting picked on a lot,

27
00:11:39,158 --> 00:11:41,077
for all the reasons
we all get picked on a lot.

28
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:42,953
Plus, I had just moved
to the US,

29
00:11:43,037 --> 00:11:44,497
so I was struggling
with my English,

30
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:45,807
and I was on my way
to lunch one day

31
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:47,666
when this guy
who was like twice my size

32
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,810
yells at me from down the hall,

33
00:11:48,834 --> 00:11:50,127
"What's up, Gangnam Style?"

34
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:52,755
So I yelled back,
"I'm not Korean, idiot."

35
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:53,839
And I turn the corner,

36
00:11:53,923 --> 00:11:55,549
and I see this guy
drop his backpack,

37
00:11:55,716 --> 00:11:57,036
he's getting
all up in his face...

38
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:59,071
And right before he was about
to throw the first punch,

39
00:11:59,095 --> 00:12:00,930
Katy comes out of nowhere,

40
00:12:01,097 --> 00:12:04,350
steps right between us
and starts screaming the lyrics

41
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:05,851
to <i>Hotel California.</i>

42
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:07,019
What?

43
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:09,386
It's the art of confusion.
Works great on stupid people.

44
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:10,481
And that's how we met.

45
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:12,209
Then I pulled him
into the parking lot...

46
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:13,359
At which point she revealed

47
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:15,736
that she had also swiped
the keys to the guy's Mustang.

48
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:17,988
Yeah, we went on a little
joyride around the block.

49
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:19,532
And your wife
was in the car, too.

50
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,325
- That's true. You were.
- What?

51
00:12:21,409 --> 00:12:22,827
I was just in the back seat.

52
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:23,911
That's a part of the car.

53
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:25,138
That's still a part of the car.

54
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:26,789
How have you
never told me this story?

55
00:12:26,956 --> 00:12:28,183
You know,
before she was a lawyer,

56
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:29,458
your girl was pretty wild.

57
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,293
Oh! What happened?

58
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:34,296
I grew up.

59
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,090
What's that supposed to mean?

60
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:37,234
Yeah, what's that
supposed to mean?

61
00:12:37,258 --> 00:12:38,926
That maybe there's a point

62
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,970
where you're supposed
to stop going on joyrides

63
00:12:41,137 --> 00:12:43,556
and start thinking about
living up to your potential.

64
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:45,224
Please tell me
you're kidding, Soo.

65
00:12:45,391 --> 00:12:46,392
Look,

66
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,680
we're now living in a world

67
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:48,727
where at any moment

68
00:12:48,811 --> 00:12:50,563
half the population
can just disappear.

69
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:53,566
Life's too short
and too fragile.

70
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:55,317
Katy, you're a valet driver

71
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:56,861
with an honours degree
from Berkeley,

72
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:59,280
and Shaun can speak,
like, four languages.

73
00:12:59,447 --> 00:13:01,447
You've always been the most
talented people I know.

74
00:13:01,532 --> 00:13:03,617
I just don't get why
you're scared

75
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:05,578
to actually use it
for something serious.

76
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:07,288
Wow.

77
00:13:08,164 --> 00:13:10,875
You sound like my mom.
You also...

78
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,376
dress like her
a little bit, too.

79
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,503
Where's this from, Talbots?

80
00:13:14,587 --> 00:13:16,505
We're not running
from adulthood.

81
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:18,966
How is it running to have jobs
that you actually like?

82
00:13:19,133 --> 00:13:20,653
Yeah, that doesn't
even make any sense.

83
00:13:20,718 --> 00:13:23,095
Did you think
valet parking is easy?

84
00:13:23,262 --> 00:13:25,181
It's like the most
challenging job ever.

85
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:27,516
You need people skills,
driving skills...

86
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:29,226
Soo can't even parallel park.

87
00:13:32,897 --> 00:13:35,566
Well, it's almost midnight.
We got the early shift.

88
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,736
Should probably be
responsible, go to sleep.

89
00:13:38,903 --> 00:13:40,623
Yeah, we can be responsible.
We can do that.

90
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,239
Or...

91
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:46,118
<i>♫ Over, sideways and
under on a... ♫</i>

92
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:48,496
<i>♫ Take my horse
to the old town road ♫</i>

93
00:13:48,579 --> 00:13:49,580
<i>♫ I'm gonna ♫</i>

94
00:13:49,663 --> 00:13:51,790
<i>♫ Close my eyes ♫</i>

95
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:53,626
<i>♫ I don't wanna... ♫</i>

96
00:14:27,535 --> 00:14:28,661
Morning, Mrs Chen.

97
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:29,954
She's not ready yet.

98
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,789
Come have some joe
while you wait.

99
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:35,417
Katy, Shaun's here.

100
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:37,336
Yeah, Mom, be there in a minute.

101
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:38,420
Ruihua,

102
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:41,006
you're supposed to be helping
your dad stock the shop.

103
00:14:41,173 --> 00:14:44,343
Mom, I can't work on an empty
stomach, my legs get crampy.

104
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:45,886
Maybe Shaun can help him

105
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:48,180
instead of just showing up
every day to eat our food.

106
00:14:48,347 --> 00:14:49,557
I'm happy to help.

107
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:52,434
No, it's Ruihua's job,
let him do it.

108
00:14:53,102 --> 00:14:54,144
Waipo.

109
00:14:57,565 --> 00:14:59,108
Oh, sorry.

110
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,424
Are you sure
that Waigong's allowed to take

111
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:07,449
Funyuns and cigarettes

112
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:08,742
back to the afterlife?

113
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:23,299
We don't think
it's silly, Waipo.

114
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,968
We just know Waigong would've
wanted you to move on

115
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:27,136
and enjoy your life.

116
00:15:27,219 --> 00:15:29,430
"Moving on" is an American idea.

117
00:15:29,597 --> 00:15:31,765
You're American, Mom!
Don't forget.

118
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:33,350
Shaun,

119
00:15:33,517 --> 00:15:36,687
did my daughter apply
to any new jobs this week?

120
00:15:36,854 --> 00:15:38,606
She really likes her job.

121
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:39,857
We both do.

122
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,941
Mm-hmm.

123
00:15:41,025 --> 00:15:42,818
Waigong didn't move here
from Hunan

124
00:15:42,985 --> 00:15:44,528
so you could park cars
for a living.

125
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:47,573
Well, on that note,

126
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:49,116
I think we're gonna
miss our bus.

127
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,242
Mm.

128
00:15:50,326 --> 00:15:52,077
I'm sorry
for my unacceptable job.

129
00:15:52,244 --> 00:15:53,597
And for staying out late
last night,

130
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:55,164
trying to enjoy my life.

131
00:15:55,623 --> 00:15:57,499
But one day, I'll make you
proud, I promise.

132
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,043
I'm proud of you, sis.

133
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:01,670
Parking cars is super hard.

134
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:02,880
Thanks, bro.

135
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:04,274
Maybe one day you'll pass
your driver's test,

136
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:05,299
live the dream like me.

137
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:06,467
Come on, Shaun, let's go.

138
00:16:24,777 --> 00:16:26,945
Look. Look at that.
Look at that girl.

139
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:29,031
She's writing a research paper
on a bus.

140
00:16:29,531 --> 00:16:30,532
So?

141
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:32,034
That is exactly the daughter

142
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:33,869
my mom wishes
came out of her vagina.

143
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:37,581
I'm sorry about her.

144
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,167
How's it goin'?

145
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,969
Do you know this guy?

146
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:54,189
I don't know what
you're talking about, dude.

147
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:57,810
- Hey! Get off of me!
- Whoa.

148
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,020
What is wrong with you, asshole?

149
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:05,984
You have the wrong guy!

150
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:07,403
Does he look like he can fight?

151
00:17:07,486 --> 00:17:09,113
Come on, bro!

152
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:19,373
You okay?

153
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:36,932
Yo, what up, y'all?
It's your boy Klev,

154
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,767
comin' at you live on the bus.

155
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:40,227
I actually did take

156
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,146
a little bit of martial arts
as a youth,

157
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:45,107
so I'm gonna try and grade
this fight as we're goin'.

158
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:00,497
Holy shit.

159
00:18:01,707 --> 00:18:03,125
Who are you?

160
00:18:17,931 --> 00:18:19,016
You got this, bro!

161
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:23,979
My bad.

162
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:50,631
No, no, no!

163
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:53,217
Sorry.

164
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:56,094
What the hell's going on?

165
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,660
You really wanna talk
about this now?

166
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:06,021
Bus driver is down.

167
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:07,356
I'm not gonna handle this.

168
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:09,775
Every time I've tried to drive
a bus, I get yelled at.

169
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:31,046
Go, you freak!

170
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,683
Open the door, please!

171
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:30,105
The back is about to go.

172
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:32,316
On my signal, make a hard right.

173
00:20:32,482 --> 00:20:33,483
What signal?

174
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:04,389
Everybody to the front now!

175
00:21:05,766 --> 00:21:07,100
Go! Go, go, go.

176
00:21:07,976 --> 00:21:10,056
What's up, y'all? What's up,
y'all? What's up, y'all?

177
00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:23,617
You and your sister
deserve what's coming.

178
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:50,060
Hold on, everybody!

179
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,311
Oh, God.

180
00:21:59,611 --> 00:22:01,446
Oh, my God!

181
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:15,961
Sorry. Heh.

182
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:18,088
We make a good team.

183
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:49,870
Shaun. Hey.

184
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:52,622
You need to tell me
what the hell's going on.

185
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:54,374
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

186
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,209
- Macau.
- Macau?

187
00:22:56,293 --> 00:22:57,645
Those guys are going
after my sister next,

188
00:22:57,669 --> 00:22:58,909
and I have to get to her first.

189
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:00,881
You have a sister?

190
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:02,108
Look, I know this is confusing.

191
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:03,443
I'll explain it
when I get back, I promise.

192
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:04,468
No, no.

193
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:05,635
Hell no, dude.

194
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:06,970
This is bullshit!

195
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:09,473
I have been by your side
for half your life.

196
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:11,701
I get there are things you
never wanted to talk about,

197
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:13,185
and I never wanted to push.

198
00:23:13,685 --> 00:23:16,354
But a guy with a freaking
machete for an arm

199
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:18,440
just chopped
our bus in half, Shaun!

200
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:20,233
Who the hell are you?

201
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:30,994
My sister sent me this
a few months ago.

202
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:33,330
I think it's the address
of where she's staying.

203
00:23:34,998 --> 00:23:39,086
Those guys back there
were sent by my dad.

204
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:40,253
What?

205
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:42,631
If they hurt her...

206
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:49,429
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

207
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:55,060
Fine.

208
00:23:55,227 --> 00:23:56,645
You can explain on the plane.

209
00:23:56,812 --> 00:23:58,146
What?
No, Katy, you can't just...

210
00:23:58,313 --> 00:24:00,023
You can explain
on the plane, Shaun!

211
00:24:23,839 --> 00:24:25,132
<i>After my mom died...</i>

212
00:24:26,591 --> 00:24:28,093
<i>my dad started my training.</i>

213
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:47,028
<i>From sunup to sundown,</i>

214
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:49,614
<i>I was taught every possible
way to kill a man.</i>

215
00:25:39,748 --> 00:25:40,749
<i>By the time I was 14,</i>

216
00:25:40,832 --> 00:25:41,833
<i>I could barely remember</i>

217
00:25:41,917 --> 00:25:43,376
<i>what life was like
before she died.</i>

218
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:47,005
<i>That's how old I was</i>

219
00:25:47,088 --> 00:25:48,965
<i>when he sent me
on my first assignment.</i>

220
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:53,803
<i>I was willing to do
anything he wanted.</i>

221
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:55,907
<i>If he asked me
to burn the world down,</i>

222
00:25:55,931 --> 00:25:56,932
<i>I would've asked him...</i>

223
00:25:57,015 --> 00:25:58,099
<i>Beef or vegetarian?</i>

224
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:01,704
We're all out of the chicken,

225
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:03,980
so I can only offer you
beef or vegetarian?

226
00:26:04,522 --> 00:26:05,649
Um...

227
00:26:05,732 --> 00:26:08,151
- Vegetarian would be great.
- Yeah, same.

228
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:09,319
- Okay.
- Thank you.

229
00:26:10,528 --> 00:26:11,529
So...

230
00:26:11,696 --> 00:26:14,074
Oh, we're out
of the vegetarian too.

231
00:26:14,658 --> 00:26:15,867
Now we only have beef.

232
00:26:16,952 --> 00:26:18,954
Beef. 'Cause that's all
you have, right?

233
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,389
- Okay, you'll have the beef.
- Yes.

234
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:21,414
- And...
- Beef.

235
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:23,458
- And the beef.
- Two beefs.

236
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:30,924
Did you go through with it?

237
00:26:38,306 --> 00:26:40,976
I knew that I couldn't
go back to him, so I just...

238
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:44,062
ran.

239
00:26:48,817 --> 00:26:51,361
I know this is a lot
to dump on you.

240
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:57,951
I'm sorry about your mom.

241
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:05,834
I should also probably mention

242
00:27:05,917 --> 00:27:08,795
that my name's
not technically Shaun.

243
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:11,172
What?

244
00:27:12,215 --> 00:27:13,216
What is it?

245
00:27:13,925 --> 00:27:16,094
It's Shang-Chi.

246
00:27:16,678 --> 00:27:17,804
Shaun-Chi.

247
00:27:17,887 --> 00:27:19,347
No. Shang-Chi.

248
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:20,890
Shaun-Chi.

249
00:27:21,516 --> 00:27:22,517
Shang.

250
00:27:22,684 --> 00:27:23,685
- Shaun.
- Shang.

251
00:27:24,227 --> 00:27:25,228
Shan.

252
00:27:25,395 --> 00:27:27,397
S-H-A-N-G. Shang.

253
00:27:27,981 --> 00:27:29,357
Shang?

254
00:27:29,524 --> 00:27:30,525
Yeah.

255
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:33,903
You changed your name
from Shang to Shaun?

256
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,947
Yeah, I don't... Yeah.

257
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:37,615
I wonder how
your father found you.

258
00:27:37,782 --> 00:27:39,200
Okay, I was 15 years old.
All right?

259
00:27:39,284 --> 00:27:41,244
What is your name change logic?

260
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:42,454
You're going into hiding.

261
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,980
- Okay.
- And your name is Michael,

262
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,874
you go on
and change it to Mishael.

263
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:48,084
That's not what happened.

264
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:49,478
It's like, "Hi, my name's Gina.

265
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:51,463
"I'm gonna go into hiding.
My new name's Gina."

266
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:52,669
Can't hear you. I'm sorry.

267
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:54,299
Yeah, okay.
Oh, yeah, you can hear me.

268
00:28:55,902 --> 00:28:57,195
Okay.

269
00:28:58,446 --> 00:29:00,365
Seems like a nice fella.

270
00:29:00,532 --> 00:29:02,367
And this elevator
is definitely up to code.

271
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:03,761
There's absolutely no chance
of it just falling off

272
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:04,865
the side of the building...

273
00:29:08,623 --> 00:29:09,624
Bus Boy!

274
00:29:10,125 --> 00:29:11,400
Uh...

275
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:16,214
Damn, dude.

276
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:17,632
Oh, no.

277
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:24,347
Oh, my Chinese sucks.

278
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:25,682
Oh, all good.

279
00:29:25,765 --> 00:29:27,392
- I speak A-B-C.
- Oh, great.

280
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:28,935
- I'm Jon Jon.
- Jon Jon.

281
00:29:29,144 --> 00:29:32,105
Welcome
to the Golden Daggers Club.

282
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,774
Okay,
let's get you ready to fight.

283
00:29:34,941 --> 00:29:36,025
Wait. What?

284
00:29:36,192 --> 00:29:38,695
We're a multi-platform
global operation.

285
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:40,989
Every fight livestreamed
on the dark web.

286
00:29:41,156 --> 00:29:43,658
Thousands of viewers
placing bets as we speak.

287
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:46,035
This is gonna take your brand
to a whole new level.

288
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:47,805
Think there's been
some sort of confusion.

289
00:29:47,829 --> 00:29:49,080
I like your spike face.

290
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:50,165
Thanks!

291
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,976
Usually, you gotta
fight your way to centre ring,

292
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,042
but a viral star like you?

293
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:54,210
Front of line, baby.

294
00:29:54,377 --> 00:29:55,795
I'm not here
to fight anybody. Okay?

295
00:29:56,004 --> 00:29:57,484
I'm looking
for my sister, Xu Xialing.

296
00:29:58,965 --> 00:29:59,966
Never heard of her.

297
00:30:00,091 --> 00:30:01,926
We just lost a fighter
at the last minute,

298
00:30:02,093 --> 00:30:03,970
so you get the next slot.

299
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:12,103
Nice one, Helen.

300
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:14,731
Is he gonna be
fighting in one of these?

301
00:30:14,814 --> 00:30:17,901
Oh, no, no, no. These are
like low-level fights.

302
00:30:18,067 --> 00:30:22,322
You're gonna be
fighting up there.

303
00:30:34,709 --> 00:30:37,629
That hurt, Emil.

304
00:30:37,712 --> 00:30:39,756
You want me to show you
how it feels?

305
00:30:48,973 --> 00:30:51,643
Wong! Wong! Wong!

306
00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:54,479
Wong! Wong! Wong!

307
00:30:54,646 --> 00:30:56,147
Go, Wong!

308
00:30:56,314 --> 00:30:57,774
I always bet on Asian.

309
00:30:57,941 --> 00:30:59,400
Oh, my God.

310
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:01,361
Yeah, look, I'm not
going up there, okay?

311
00:31:01,444 --> 00:31:02,838
- I'm just trying to...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

312
00:31:02,862 --> 00:31:03,964
It's too late to back out now.

313
00:31:03,988 --> 00:31:05,657
- You already committed, bro.
- What?

314
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,784
You signed
the contract, remember?

315
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:09,285
Your name's on the roster.

316
00:31:09,494 --> 00:31:11,204
The bets are piling in.

317
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:13,414
- Really? What's our cut?
- Oh, it's huge.

318
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:14,582
It doesn't matter.

319
00:31:14,749 --> 00:31:15,833
It matters.

320
00:31:16,459 --> 00:31:18,711
Dude, I saw you
fight five assassins

321
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:20,755
and a giant Romanian
with a razor for an arm

322
00:31:20,922 --> 00:31:22,215
on a moving bus.

323
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:23,591
This is just one guy.

324
00:31:23,758 --> 00:31:26,219
Just do it.
Then we all get paid,

325
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:29,305
and then I'll help you find
whoever you're looking for.

326
00:31:29,514 --> 00:31:30,974
Come on. You got this.

327
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:32,433
- You got this.
- Don't be nervous.

328
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,601
Thank you.

329
00:31:33,685 --> 00:31:34,769
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

330
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:44,028
How's the jaw?

331
00:31:46,155 --> 00:31:48,157
Maybe you'll start
controlling those punches

332
00:31:48,241 --> 00:31:49,576
like we practised?

333
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:56,416
Love that guy.

334
00:31:57,959 --> 00:31:59,377
Now take your shirt off.

335
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,838
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

336
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:04,257
<i>the fight we've all
been waiting for.</i>

337
00:32:04,716 --> 00:32:07,135
<i>The incredible viral sensation,</i>

338
00:32:07,302 --> 00:32:11,264
<i>all the way
from San Francisco, USA,</i>

339
00:32:11,681 --> 00:32:14,684
<i>it's Bus Boy!</i>

340
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:20,481
What happened to your shirt?

341
00:32:24,944 --> 00:32:27,572
<i>And his opponent for tonight,</i>

342
00:32:28,114 --> 00:32:31,159
<i>it's Macau's
own fearsome killer...</i>

343
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:37,457
<i>Xu Xialing!</i>

344
00:32:45,423 --> 00:32:46,591
Wait, wait!

345
00:33:15,286 --> 00:33:16,579
<i>Ooh, that's gotta hurt.</i>

346
00:34:18,641 --> 00:34:20,893
I know
what you're going there to do.

347
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:23,855
I don't know what
he's telling you, but Mom...

348
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:25,648
Mom's dead.

349
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:46,000
Xialing

350
00:35:14,197 --> 00:35:15,865
<i>Xu Xialing, you're amazing!</i>

351
00:35:16,032 --> 00:35:17,700
<i>We love you, Xu Xialing!
Whoo!</i>

352
00:35:42,183 --> 00:35:43,768
Where'd you get all that money?

353
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:46,437
Did you bet against me?

354
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:48,189
No.

355
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:51,108
Hi, Xialing. I'm Katy.

356
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:52,527
You're, like, such a badass.

357
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:54,004
Everything that you do is,
like, so cool.

358
00:35:54,028 --> 00:35:55,196
That was really cool.

359
00:35:55,822 --> 00:35:56,823
I like your pants.

360
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:58,825
Thank you. Thanks. Yeah.

361
00:36:00,535 --> 00:36:01,744
What do you want?

362
00:36:01,911 --> 00:36:04,163
The Ten Rings ambushed us
in San Francisco.

363
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:05,498
I saw the video.

364
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:07,041
They took my pendant.

365
00:36:08,209 --> 00:36:09,752
They're gonna come
for yours next.

366
00:36:12,547 --> 00:36:13,987
I don't know
what he wants with them,

367
00:36:14,048 --> 00:36:15,508
but we both know
it can't be good.

368
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:21,806
You know what he said to me
when he left?

369
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:25,268
"I'll be back in three days."

370
00:36:26,769 --> 00:36:27,770
And after three days,

371
00:36:27,854 --> 00:36:30,022
I went to our mom's shrine
and waited.

372
00:36:32,567 --> 00:36:34,402
Three days turned into a week,

373
00:36:35,069 --> 00:36:36,612
a week turned to a month,

374
00:36:36,696 --> 00:36:38,948
and a month turned to six years.

375
00:36:44,412 --> 00:36:45,872
That's how long
it took me to realise

376
00:36:45,955 --> 00:36:47,665
I didn't need him any more.

377
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:52,712
I built this place on my own.

378
00:36:53,004 --> 00:36:56,841
I didn't need you then,
and I don't need you now.

379
00:36:58,634 --> 00:37:00,553
Then why would you
send me the postcard?

380
00:37:01,012 --> 00:37:02,388
What postcard?

381
00:37:10,521 --> 00:37:12,064
I didn't send you this.

382
00:37:19,363 --> 00:37:20,781
Is there a back exit?

383
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,366
Shaun.

384
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,995
Hey. Hey!
Hey, open up!

385
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:31,876
She's gone, dude.

386
00:37:48,643 --> 00:37:49,644
What do we do?

387
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,228
What do we do?

388
00:37:51,562 --> 00:37:52,563
Uh...

389
00:37:58,736 --> 00:38:00,112
Come on!

390
00:38:05,076 --> 00:38:07,203
Oh, hell no. Screw you!
I'm not doing this.

391
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:08,430
If we make it to the elevator,

392
00:38:08,454 --> 00:38:09,734
we can hop in on the next floor.

393
00:38:11,165 --> 00:38:13,000
Katy, we're out of options.
We have to go now.

394
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,214
One, two, three.

395
00:38:20,466 --> 00:38:21,467
Whoa.

396
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,410
Just head
straight for that elevator.

397
00:38:26,389 --> 00:38:27,556
You got this.

398
00:38:39,443 --> 00:38:41,028
I'll buy you some time.
Just keep going.

399
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:46,260
Shaun!

400
00:39:49,096 --> 00:39:51,515
Shaun! Shaun!

401
00:39:54,977 --> 00:39:56,729
Oh, my God! Ohhh!

402
00:40:01,734 --> 00:40:02,777
I'm coming!

403
00:40:08,032 --> 00:40:09,283
Shaun!

404
00:40:10,451 --> 00:40:11,619
Hang on.

405
00:40:14,371 --> 00:40:16,123
Gotcha.

406
00:40:16,624 --> 00:40:17,625
Shaun!

407
00:40:19,376 --> 00:40:20,669
Katy!

408
00:41:09,885 --> 00:41:11,325
What does
he want with the pendant...

409
00:41:17,101 --> 00:41:18,727
Did America make you soft?

410
00:41:33,701 --> 00:41:35,119
He has the pendant!

411
00:42:59,203 --> 00:43:00,204
I told my men

412
00:43:00,287 --> 00:43:03,624
they wouldn't be able
to kill you if they tried.

413
00:43:04,875 --> 00:43:06,335
Glad I was right.

414
00:43:18,889 --> 00:43:20,349
Let's go home.

415
00:44:19,158 --> 00:44:20,534
My son is home.

416
00:44:25,122 --> 00:44:26,582
Take the girls to their room.

417
00:44:37,259 --> 00:44:39,887
I've seen some really
scary stuff this week,

418
00:44:40,054 --> 00:44:43,057
but your dad's on,
like, a whole 'nother level.

419
00:44:44,767 --> 00:44:46,477
Is he gonna kill us?

420
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:51,398
Just nod. Don't talk.
He'll forget you're there.

421
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,817
That's how I survived.

422
00:44:54,902 --> 00:44:56,820
He always treat you like that?

423
00:44:58,739 --> 00:45:00,908
Only after my mom died.

424
00:45:02,868 --> 00:45:07,289
He said he couldn't look at me
because I reminded him of her.

425
00:45:08,874 --> 00:45:11,085
I wasn't allowed to train
with the boys.

426
00:45:12,378 --> 00:45:14,129
But I watched
everything they did

427
00:45:14,213 --> 00:45:16,256
and taught myself
to do it better.

428
00:45:18,592 --> 00:45:19,968
When did you leave?

429
00:45:20,135 --> 00:45:22,388
I ran away when I was 16.

430
00:45:22,805 --> 00:45:25,432
As soon as I knew
my brother wasn't coming back.

431
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:29,353
You started an underground
fight ring in Macau

432
00:45:29,978 --> 00:45:31,730
when you were 16 years old?

433
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:36,151
If my dad won't let me
into his empire,

434
00:45:36,235 --> 00:45:37,694
I'm gonna build my own.

435
00:45:38,987 --> 00:45:40,322
Hell yeah.

436
00:46:06,682 --> 00:46:07,683
Shang-Chi.

437
00:46:18,402 --> 00:46:20,863
Have you been
practicing your English?

438
00:46:23,031 --> 00:46:24,158
Yes.

439
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,830
You have to strengthen your
mind along with your body.

440
00:46:36,211 --> 00:46:39,756
If you want them
to be yours one day,

441
00:46:39,923 --> 00:46:43,844
you have to show me you're
strong enough to carry them.

442
00:47:01,445 --> 00:47:02,946
How did you find me?

443
00:47:03,739 --> 00:47:05,991
I always know
where my children are.

444
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:08,785
I gave you 10 years
to live your life,

445
00:47:08,869 --> 00:47:10,162
and where did it get you?

446
00:47:13,415 --> 00:47:17,252
Now it's time for you
to take your place by my side.

447
00:47:18,253 --> 00:47:20,589
That's not gonna happen.

448
00:47:24,092 --> 00:47:25,719
American girl.

449
00:47:25,886 --> 00:47:27,012
Her name is Katy.

450
00:47:28,305 --> 00:47:29,973
What is your Chinese name?

451
00:47:33,977 --> 00:47:35,270
Ruiwen.

452
00:47:36,313 --> 00:47:38,482
Names are sacred, Ruiwen.

453
00:47:38,649 --> 00:47:40,651
They connect us
not only to ourselves,

454
00:47:40,734 --> 00:47:42,528
but to everyone who came before.

455
00:47:43,987 --> 00:47:45,656
A funny story.

456
00:47:45,822 --> 00:47:48,283
Some years ago,
a terrorist from America

457
00:47:48,367 --> 00:47:49,785
needed a boogeyman

458
00:47:49,952 --> 00:47:52,579
to bring your country
to its knees.

459
00:47:52,746 --> 00:47:55,415
So, he appropriated
The Ten Rings.

460
00:47:55,499 --> 00:47:56,500
My Ten Rings.

461
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:59,086
But because
he didn't know my actual name,

462
00:47:59,169 --> 00:48:00,546
he invented a new one.

463
00:48:01,171 --> 00:48:03,131
Do you know the name he chose?

464
00:48:04,967 --> 00:48:06,510
The Mandarin.

465
00:48:06,677 --> 00:48:09,638
He gave his figurehead
the name of a chicken dish.

466
00:48:10,055 --> 00:48:11,473
And it worked.

467
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:13,433
America was terrified.

468
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:15,894
Of an orange.

469
00:48:17,688 --> 00:48:18,981
The truth is,

470
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:22,025
I've had many names
throughout my life.

471
00:48:22,734 --> 00:48:25,153
The Warrior King, Master Khan,

472
00:48:25,237 --> 00:48:27,364
the most dangerous man on Earth.

473
00:48:27,698 --> 00:48:31,743
For years, I thought that was
all I was meant to be.

474
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:37,457
But when I met their mother,

475
00:48:38,208 --> 00:48:40,002
everything changed.

476
00:48:54,224 --> 00:48:57,853
<i>She showed me a part of myself
I didn't know was there.</i>

477
00:49:00,606 --> 00:49:03,483
<i>It was like I was seeing
the world for the first time.</i>

478
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:17,205
<i>She gave up everything
so we could be together.</i>

479
00:49:20,459 --> 00:49:22,127
<i>And so did I.</i>

480
00:49:47,319 --> 00:49:48,779
<i>After all those years,</i>

481
00:49:48,862 --> 00:49:50,447
<i>I finally found something</i>

482
00:49:50,614 --> 00:49:52,783
<i>worth growing old for.</i>

483
00:49:58,246 --> 00:50:00,624
My real name is Wenwu.

484
00:50:01,458 --> 00:50:04,044
She was the only one
who called me that.

485
00:50:05,712 --> 00:50:07,506
And when she died...

486
00:50:10,717 --> 00:50:13,053
I was lost for many years.

487
00:50:15,764 --> 00:50:17,766
But I'm not lost any more.

488
00:50:22,145 --> 00:50:23,605
When you children ran away,

489
00:50:23,772 --> 00:50:26,316
I was so desperate
to connect with your mother,

490
00:50:26,483 --> 00:50:29,695
I threw myself back into
the studies of her village.

491
00:50:30,278 --> 00:50:32,072
The legendary Ta Lo.

492
00:50:33,281 --> 00:50:34,449
I wasn't able

493
00:50:34,533 --> 00:50:36,785
to find the secret path
to the village entrance,

494
00:50:36,952 --> 00:50:40,497
but I did find
what they are hiding.

495
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:43,583
There's a gate
deep in their mountains.

496
00:50:44,251 --> 00:50:46,920
Your mother
is waiting for us there.

497
00:50:49,881 --> 00:50:51,508
I know this is a lot.

498
00:50:51,717 --> 00:50:55,554
I might not have believed it
if she didn't tell me herself.

499
00:50:56,388 --> 00:50:58,014
What are you talking about?

500
00:50:58,515 --> 00:51:00,600
I was sitting right here
in this seat,

501
00:51:01,017 --> 00:51:03,061
deep in my research...

502
00:51:04,271 --> 00:51:06,148
and she spoke to me.

503
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:09,693
It was like
she was standing in this room.

504
00:51:09,860 --> 00:51:12,696
I could feel her breath
on my cheek

505
00:51:12,779 --> 00:51:14,740
and her hand on my back.

506
00:51:16,283 --> 00:51:18,535
She told me she needs my help.

507
00:51:20,287 --> 00:51:21,496
To do what?

508
00:51:22,289 --> 00:51:24,666
To save her from her people.

509
00:51:27,836 --> 00:51:29,671
After we fell in love,

510
00:51:29,755 --> 00:51:32,466
your mother wanted us
to live in Ta Lo.

511
00:51:32,632 --> 00:51:34,634
She asked permission
from the elders,

512
00:51:34,718 --> 00:51:35,886
and they refused.

513
00:51:36,052 --> 00:51:38,263
They said I wasn't worthy.

514
00:51:40,056 --> 00:51:41,391
She would still be with us.

515
00:51:41,475 --> 00:51:44,102
We would all be
living there together.

516
00:51:44,895 --> 00:51:46,605
Ta Lo did this to us.

517
00:51:48,398 --> 00:51:51,026
They locked her behind
that gate to punish her.

518
00:51:55,447 --> 00:51:56,698
Don't you see?

519
00:51:57,657 --> 00:51:59,743
She's leaving clues for us.

520
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:01,369
She wants us to find her

521
00:52:01,536 --> 00:52:04,289
and bring her home,
so we can be a family again.

522
00:52:05,165 --> 00:52:07,834
Dad, Mom's gone.

523
00:52:09,169 --> 00:52:11,129
She's not talking to you
from behind a gate,

524
00:52:11,213 --> 00:52:13,507
and she's not leaving
any clues for us.

525
00:52:18,845 --> 00:52:20,847
Then what are these?

526
00:53:07,352 --> 00:53:11,022
The passage to Ta Lo
is guarded by a moving maze.

527
00:53:12,065 --> 00:53:15,193
But there's a direct path
through the forest

528
00:53:15,277 --> 00:53:17,362
that only opens once a year

529
00:53:17,529 --> 00:53:19,447
on Qingming Jie.

530
00:53:20,407 --> 00:53:22,951
To get through,
you need to know the route

531
00:53:23,034 --> 00:53:25,412
and the exact time it opens.

532
00:53:29,833 --> 00:53:31,459
Now I know both.

533
00:53:43,221 --> 00:53:45,265
Three days from now,

534
00:53:45,432 --> 00:53:47,809
we will rescue
my wife from her prison

535
00:53:47,893 --> 00:53:49,102
and bring her home.

536
00:53:55,775 --> 00:53:57,444
This is why you're here.

537
00:53:58,361 --> 00:53:59,946
To help me bring her back to us.

538
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:02,824
And what happens if they don't
let you open the gate?

539
00:54:04,451 --> 00:54:07,871
We'll burn the village
to the ground.

540
00:54:09,915 --> 00:54:10,916
What?

541
00:54:13,627 --> 00:54:15,921
You can't just march
into our mom's village

542
00:54:16,004 --> 00:54:17,422
with this bullshit.

543
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:19,479
I mean, do you have
any idea how insane...

544
00:54:24,638 --> 00:54:25,639
Hey!

545
00:54:28,516 --> 00:54:31,061
Where are you taking me?

546
00:54:37,442 --> 00:54:38,610
Lock them up.

547
00:55:21,111 --> 00:55:25,907
So, um,
pretty confused right now,

548
00:55:26,074 --> 00:55:29,619
because, uh, initially
I thought your dad should

549
00:55:29,828 --> 00:55:31,746
definitely see a therapist
for his delusions,

550
00:55:31,955 --> 00:55:35,542
but then that dragon
vomited a magical water map,

551
00:55:36,292 --> 00:55:38,670
and now I have no idea
what's real.

552
00:55:41,089 --> 00:55:43,425
Is what he said
about your mom's village true?

553
00:55:47,137 --> 00:55:48,614
She used to tell us stories
about Ta Lo

554
00:55:48,638 --> 00:55:49,639
when we were kids.

555
00:55:50,682 --> 00:55:54,894
A village in another dimension
full of magical creatures.

556
00:55:54,978 --> 00:55:56,980
I thought
it was just a fairy tale.

557
00:55:58,940 --> 00:56:00,775
What if Dad's right?

558
00:56:02,569 --> 00:56:03,963
About Mom being locked
behind a gate

559
00:56:03,987 --> 00:56:05,947
by her own people?

560
00:56:06,114 --> 00:56:08,366
Crazier things
have turned out to be true.

561
00:56:09,576 --> 00:56:11,745
Look, I don't know
what the hell is going on,

562
00:56:11,911 --> 00:56:14,330
but if we don't find a way
to get to Ta Lo before him,

563
00:56:14,497 --> 00:56:16,916
he's gonna destroy everything
that's left of our family.

564
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:22,088
This family was destroyed
a long time ago.

565
00:56:26,384 --> 00:56:28,053
The hell was that?

566
00:56:28,136 --> 00:56:30,305
Oh.

567
00:56:30,388 --> 00:56:32,640
You're going toward that noise?

568
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,455
"Wake Duncan with thy knocking.

569
00:56:55,622 --> 00:56:58,583
"Oh, I would'st though could'st.

570
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:00,293
"My deed 'twere best not..."

571
00:57:03,296 --> 00:57:05,256
Oh, hello, loves.

572
00:57:06,382 --> 00:57:07,842
What year is it?

573
00:57:09,344 --> 00:57:10,720
Who are you?

574
00:57:10,887 --> 00:57:13,014
Trevor? Slattery?

575
00:57:13,181 --> 00:57:15,600
The actor from Liverpool?

576
00:57:16,518 --> 00:57:17,519
Wait.

577
00:57:17,685 --> 00:57:19,229
Are you the governor's kids?

578
00:57:19,896 --> 00:57:21,523
I've been preparing a monologue

579
00:57:21,606 --> 00:57:23,274
for your homecoming dinner.

580
00:57:23,441 --> 00:57:25,318
Oh. Where's she going?

581
00:57:25,485 --> 00:57:26,653
Why are you down here?

582
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:28,780
Well, some time ago,

583
00:57:28,863 --> 00:57:30,406
I was offered
the role of a terrorist.

584
00:57:30,615 --> 00:57:32,867
I know, facile, trite,
I couldn't agree more.

585
00:57:33,034 --> 00:57:34,953
But times were lean,
you know what I mean?

586
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:37,872
Anyway, the producer told me
he worked for the BBC.

587
00:57:38,039 --> 00:57:39,499
But, ironic twist,

588
00:57:39,582 --> 00:57:42,168
it turns out he, in fact,
was a terrorist,

589
00:57:42,335 --> 00:57:43,895
and I wasn't playing
a character at all,

590
00:57:44,003 --> 00:57:45,296
but what I now recognise to be

591
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:47,340
a rather unflattering portrait
of your father.

592
00:57:47,757 --> 00:57:49,509
We all got our just deserts.

593
00:57:49,676 --> 00:57:51,553
The producer
got blown up by Iron Man,

594
00:57:51,636 --> 00:57:53,304
and I served time
in federal prison,

595
00:57:53,471 --> 00:57:56,307
which turned out
to be the best thing for me.

596
00:57:56,391 --> 00:57:58,810
I got clean,
I rediscovered my passion.

597
00:57:58,977 --> 00:58:01,563
- Then my dad broke you out?
- Exactly.

598
00:58:01,729 --> 00:58:03,815
- To kill you.
- Exactly.

599
00:58:04,566 --> 00:58:06,901
But just as his men

600
00:58:06,985 --> 00:58:09,612
were tying me up
for my execution,

601
00:58:09,779 --> 00:58:11,656
I launched into a performance
of my Macbeth.

602
00:58:11,739 --> 00:58:13,366
"Whence is that knocking?
Wake Duncan

603
00:58:13,449 --> 00:58:15,010
"with thy knocking.
I would'st though could'st..."

604
00:58:15,034 --> 00:58:16,274
They couldn't get enough of it.

605
00:58:16,369 --> 00:58:18,788
I've been doing weekly gigs
for the lads ever since.

606
00:58:18,955 --> 00:58:20,832
So you're like his jester?

607
00:58:20,999 --> 00:58:22,679
I can give you a quick preview
if you like.

608
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:24,002
"Nuncle, nuncle, nuncle..."

609
00:58:24,169 --> 00:58:26,462
Uh, thank you, Trevor.
I think we're okay.

610
00:58:26,671 --> 00:58:28,566
Right now, we really just
need to find a way to...

611
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:30,008
What the hell?

612
00:58:30,091 --> 00:58:31,217
What the... Oh!

613
00:58:31,301 --> 00:58:32,343
- Whoa!
- What is that?

614
00:58:34,053 --> 00:58:35,054
What's what?

615
00:58:35,221 --> 00:58:37,015
- That! What is that?
- That! That! That!

616
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:40,685
You can see Morris?

617
00:58:40,852 --> 00:58:41,853
Morris?

618
00:58:41,936 --> 00:58:44,606
Oh, Morris!

619
00:58:44,772 --> 00:58:47,108
They can see you! You're real!

620
00:58:47,275 --> 00:58:50,320
All this time I thought
I was hallucinating him.

621
00:58:50,486 --> 00:58:51,988
Oh, this is such fab news.

622
00:58:53,072 --> 00:58:54,073
Where's his face?

623
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:57,368
He's a bit sensitive about that.

624
00:58:58,494 --> 00:59:00,205
Oh. Really?

625
00:59:01,831 --> 00:59:03,458
Morris says he knows
who you are.

626
00:59:04,167 --> 00:59:05,501
It talks... It talks to you?

627
00:59:05,585 --> 00:59:07,128
If he didn't talk to me,

628
00:59:07,212 --> 00:59:09,047
I'd have gone mad yonks ago.

629
00:59:10,423 --> 00:59:11,799
How would he know me?

630
00:59:11,966 --> 00:59:14,802
He says he grew up
with your mum. In Ta Lo.

631
00:59:15,678 --> 00:59:18,765
Apparently, your father picked
him up in some magic forest

632
00:59:18,932 --> 00:59:21,643
on one of his expeditions
to find the entrance.

633
00:59:25,313 --> 00:59:26,898
He wants you to take him home.

634
00:59:29,484 --> 00:59:31,527
Believe me, buddy,
I would if I knew how.

635
00:59:32,237 --> 00:59:33,238
According to my dad,

636
00:59:33,321 --> 00:59:35,073
the path there
only opens once a year.

637
00:59:38,576 --> 00:59:40,745
Oh.

638
00:59:41,955 --> 00:59:44,540
Morris says he can guide you
there right now.

639
00:59:44,707 --> 00:59:45,917
You can get through the maze

640
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,585
without waiting
for the path to open.

641
00:59:47,752 --> 00:59:49,754
But, and it's a big "but,"

642
00:59:49,921 --> 00:59:51,965
it's very dangerous.

643
00:59:52,131 --> 00:59:53,132
How dangerous?

644
00:59:53,299 --> 00:59:55,218
No one's ever made it out alive.

645
00:59:55,385 --> 00:59:58,179
But Morris is 90% confident

646
00:59:58,346 --> 01:00:00,098
he can guide us through safely.

647
01:00:00,181 --> 01:00:01,724
Oh.

648
01:00:01,808 --> 01:00:03,309
19%.

649
01:00:05,812 --> 01:00:08,314
Look, I've done dumber things
with worse odds.

650
01:00:08,481 --> 01:00:10,191
But even if
that chicken-pig is right...

651
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:12,599
we're still locked in your...

652
01:00:18,574 --> 01:00:19,701
Whew!

653
01:00:22,662 --> 01:00:23,955
How did you...

654
01:00:24,122 --> 01:00:26,541
Dad has a tunnel system
under the whole compound.

655
01:00:26,708 --> 01:00:28,459
That's how I escaped last time.

656
01:00:28,626 --> 01:00:29,627
Oh.

657
01:00:29,711 --> 01:00:31,754
This will take us
straight to the garage.

658
01:00:43,474 --> 01:00:45,310
Oh, my God.

659
01:00:45,476 --> 01:00:46,978
I kinda like this guy.

660
01:00:47,145 --> 01:00:49,105
Just head up that ramp
and through the front gate.

661
01:00:49,147 --> 01:00:50,273
Should be a straight shot.

662
01:00:50,356 --> 01:00:52,066
Figure we got about
30 seconds until he...

663
01:00:52,233 --> 01:00:53,234
Do you mind?

664
01:00:53,401 --> 01:00:55,361
I get sick in the back.
Carsick.

665
01:00:58,573 --> 01:00:59,741
That's my car!

666
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:06,331
God damn it.

667
01:01:06,497 --> 01:01:07,623
Hold on.

668
01:01:09,125 --> 01:01:10,168
Is there another exit?

669
01:01:10,251 --> 01:01:11,502
The other end of the garage.

670
01:01:11,669 --> 01:01:13,171
But we need a fingerprint
to open it.

671
01:01:19,969 --> 01:01:21,304
Incoming!

672
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:23,806
Shit!

673
01:01:45,787 --> 01:01:47,163
What's happening back there?

674
01:01:48,498 --> 01:01:49,582
Doing my best.

675
01:01:49,707 --> 01:01:51,501
<i>Scan hand print for gate access.</i>

676
01:01:51,584 --> 01:01:53,878
- Hurry up!
- I'm trying!

677
01:01:56,214 --> 01:01:57,358
<i>Scan hand print for gate access.</i>

678
01:01:57,382 --> 01:01:58,383
Shaun!

679
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:01,135
<i>Access approved.</i>

680
01:02:19,862 --> 01:02:22,281
They will come back
once I bring her home.

681
01:02:24,117 --> 01:02:25,868
Prepare the men for war.

682
01:02:26,869 --> 01:02:27,912
Yes, sir.

683
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:36,421
The first time
I witnessed pure artistry.

684
01:02:36,796 --> 01:02:40,550
1968. <i>Planet of the Apes.</i>

685
01:02:40,716 --> 01:02:42,718
I was sitting in the cinema
next to my mum,

686
01:02:42,802 --> 01:02:44,262
watching mastery

687
01:02:44,429 --> 01:02:46,305
unfold before my very eyes.

688
01:02:46,472 --> 01:02:48,599
After the film, I asked her,

689
01:02:48,766 --> 01:02:51,185
"How did they get those
monkeys to do those things?"

690
01:02:51,352 --> 01:02:54,147
And she patted me on the head
and she said,

691
01:02:54,313 --> 01:02:57,191
"It's not real, pet.
It's just acting."

692
01:02:57,358 --> 01:02:59,068
That's when I knew.

693
01:03:00,153 --> 01:03:01,571
If they can teach those monkeys

694
01:03:01,654 --> 01:03:03,573
to act that brilliantly,

695
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:07,493
just imagine what I could
bring to the world.

696
01:03:08,077 --> 01:03:09,203
So you became an actor

697
01:03:09,370 --> 01:03:11,289
because you thought
the monkeys were actually...

698
01:03:11,456 --> 01:03:14,125
Riding horses? I did. Yes.

699
01:03:14,292 --> 01:03:15,877
When, in fact,

700
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:19,046
they were simply acting
as if they were riding horses.

701
01:03:19,213 --> 01:03:21,424
I still can't get my head
round it, to be honest.

702
01:03:22,467 --> 01:03:24,260
Good for you, dude.

703
01:03:24,802 --> 01:03:28,264
You found your passion
and went for it,

704
01:03:28,431 --> 01:03:29,515
and eventually used it

705
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:31,642
to cripple the US government,
but whatever.

706
01:03:31,809 --> 01:03:33,769
Yeah.
No, yeah, thanks.

707
01:03:33,853 --> 01:03:35,855
Um, this is really cool and all,

708
01:03:35,938 --> 01:03:37,398
but how long
do we have to sit here?

709
01:03:37,565 --> 01:03:39,025
Morris is very clear.

710
01:03:39,609 --> 01:03:41,486
The way through
is all about timing.

711
01:03:41,986 --> 01:03:43,696
Okay, but how long
are we talking?

712
01:03:43,863 --> 01:03:45,573
Like, hours? Days?

713
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:48,367
Friends,
I am but a transitory vessel

714
01:03:48,451 --> 01:03:49,891
for the infinite wisdom
of a creature

715
01:03:50,036 --> 01:03:52,288
far more advanced than
we'll ever truly understand.

716
01:03:52,914 --> 01:03:54,540
What he sees, what he feels

717
01:03:54,624 --> 01:03:56,334
of this vast, unknown universe

718
01:03:56,501 --> 01:03:58,419
is beyond anything
our simple brains can...

719
01:03:58,503 --> 01:03:59,921
Oh. You can go.

720
01:04:00,338 --> 01:04:01,380
What?

721
01:04:01,464 --> 01:04:03,257
Go. You can go. He says "go."

722
01:04:26,489 --> 01:04:27,949
You should speed up.

723
01:04:28,616 --> 01:04:29,617
What? Why?

724
01:04:31,827 --> 01:04:32,995
Katy, go, go, go!

725
01:04:36,999 --> 01:04:38,084
Morris says,

726
01:04:38,167 --> 01:04:40,044
- "Hard right on three."
- What?

727
01:04:40,211 --> 01:04:41,212
Two...

728
01:04:41,295 --> 01:04:42,296
Hard right where?

729
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:43,756
Now.

730
01:04:51,013 --> 01:04:52,306
And left.

731
01:04:56,727 --> 01:04:58,312
It's all about staying
in the pocket.

732
01:04:58,479 --> 01:05:00,147
- What pocket?
- We're in it now.

733
01:05:00,314 --> 01:05:02,034
What happens if
we don't stay in the pocket?

734
01:05:02,149 --> 01:05:03,150
The forest eats us.

735
01:05:03,317 --> 01:05:04,777
Eats us? What does that mean?

736
01:05:04,944 --> 01:05:06,487
He says it eats us.
Go left.

737
01:05:14,704 --> 01:05:16,747
- Watch your back!
- Stay in the pocket.

738
01:05:16,914 --> 01:05:18,499
- How close is it?
- Five metres.

739
01:05:18,666 --> 01:05:20,426
- Stay in the pocket.
- What is that in feet?

740
01:05:20,585 --> 01:05:21,586
Really fricking close.

741
01:05:21,752 --> 01:05:22,753
Stay in the pocket.

742
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:24,800
Will you just stop saying,
"Stay in the pocket"?

743
01:05:31,053 --> 01:05:33,180
One last right,
then straight on to the end.

744
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:42,565
You might wanna hurry up.

745
01:05:42,732 --> 01:05:44,567
What do you think I'm doing?

746
01:05:46,193 --> 01:05:47,236
We're not gonna make it.

747
01:05:50,406 --> 01:05:51,991
I'm coming home, Mummy.

748
01:06:04,295 --> 01:06:07,256
Morris says,
"Great job, everyone."

749
01:06:08,674 --> 01:06:11,552
Now, all we have to do
is go through that waterfall,

750
01:06:11,719 --> 01:06:13,512
and we're pretty much there.

751
01:07:03,854 --> 01:07:04,897
Bloody hell.

752
01:07:05,064 --> 01:07:06,816
I think those birds are on fire.

753
01:07:06,899 --> 01:07:09,276
Really? Oh.

754
01:07:09,568 --> 01:07:11,779
Morris says it's normal.

755
01:07:11,946 --> 01:07:14,281
They're old mates of his.

756
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:50,192
That's a weird horse.

757
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:53,362
What's it looking at me for?

758
01:09:24,245 --> 01:09:25,496
Whoa.

759
01:09:25,579 --> 01:09:26,997
Guang Bo!

760
01:10:06,579 --> 01:10:07,705
Hi, I'm Katy.

761
01:10:07,913 --> 01:10:09,290
Welcome to Ta Lo, Katy.

762
01:10:09,373 --> 01:10:10,958
Oh, thank you.

763
01:10:16,755 --> 01:10:19,258
Look who has found his way home!

764
01:10:19,925 --> 01:10:21,176
I'm not a threat.

765
01:10:21,343 --> 01:10:23,470
Just an entertainer.

766
01:10:23,637 --> 01:10:25,222
Morris can vouch for me.

767
01:10:27,182 --> 01:10:28,559
We don't have much time.

768
01:10:29,018 --> 01:10:30,352
Our father is coming.

769
01:10:38,444 --> 01:10:41,405
Our people have been
here for over 4,000 years,

770
01:10:41,572 --> 01:10:44,366
preparing for something
we hope will never happen.

771
01:10:44,533 --> 01:10:47,077
We are the keepers
of the Dark Gate,

772
01:10:47,244 --> 01:10:49,622
sworn to protect this realm
and yours

773
01:10:49,705 --> 01:10:52,291
from the evil
that's locked behind it.

774
01:10:53,125 --> 01:10:55,336
Our dad is coming
here to open that gate.

775
01:10:55,878 --> 01:10:57,880
He thinks
you're holding our mom there.

776
01:10:59,173 --> 01:11:00,674
Why would he think that?

777
01:11:00,841 --> 01:11:02,051
She told him.

778
01:11:02,217 --> 01:11:04,261
He says he can hear her
asking for help.

779
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:08,682
Is he wearing the rings?

780
01:11:08,849 --> 01:11:10,976
He hasn't
taken them off since she died.

781
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:14,521
What do they have to do
with all this?

782
01:11:18,442 --> 01:11:20,527
The realm of Ta Lo
stretches far beyond

783
01:11:20,611 --> 01:11:22,488
the shores of our small village.

784
01:11:22,655 --> 01:11:26,325
We have cities that surpass
any in your universe,

785
01:11:26,492 --> 01:11:29,203
rich with culture and history.

786
01:11:29,370 --> 01:11:31,372
Thousands of years ago,

787
01:11:31,538 --> 01:11:34,792
all of our people
lived in peace and prosperity,

788
01:11:35,876 --> 01:11:39,004
until the attack
of the Dweller-in-Darkness.

789
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:41,048
He came with his army,

790
01:11:41,131 --> 01:11:44,176
devouring every soul
in their path,

791
01:11:44,343 --> 01:11:48,013
and with each kill,
they grew stronger.

792
01:11:48,681 --> 01:11:51,225
After decimating
our largest cities,

793
01:11:51,392 --> 01:11:54,812
they were headed to
your universe to do the same.

794
01:11:54,979 --> 01:11:58,357
The leaders of Ta Lo sent
their strongest warriors here

795
01:11:58,524 --> 01:12:01,735
to stop them from reaching
the portal to your world.

796
01:12:02,319 --> 01:12:05,447
But our ancestors
were no match for them.

797
01:12:06,573 --> 01:12:09,576
Until The Great Protector

798
01:12:09,702 --> 01:12:13,247
joined their fight
and turned the tide.

799
01:12:13,956 --> 01:12:16,959
Together, they pushed
the Dweller and his army

800
01:12:17,042 --> 01:12:18,252
into the Dark Gate

801
01:12:18,419 --> 01:12:20,879
and locked it behind them.

802
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:26,260
Our people have guarded
that gate ever since,

803
01:12:26,427 --> 01:12:29,888
empowered by the magic
of The Great Protector

804
01:12:30,055 --> 01:12:32,349
and the gift that she gave us.

805
01:12:43,986 --> 01:12:44,987
Dragon scales.

806
01:12:45,154 --> 01:12:46,822
Makes very good armour.

807
01:12:48,949 --> 01:12:50,993
Your father isn't the first
to come here

808
01:12:51,076 --> 01:12:52,327
to open the Dark Gate.

809
01:12:52,911 --> 01:12:55,164
Many have tried and failed
over the centuries,

810
01:12:55,330 --> 01:12:57,666
and they all had one thing
in common.

811
01:12:57,833 --> 01:12:58,834
They were lured here

812
01:12:58,917 --> 01:13:01,045
by the voice of something
on the other side.

813
01:13:01,837 --> 01:13:04,715
A voice that promised them
their greatest desires.

814
01:13:07,176 --> 01:13:11,346
So you think soul eaters
are talking to our dad?

815
01:13:12,139 --> 01:13:15,476
They know The Ten Rings have
the power to break them free.

816
01:13:19,813 --> 01:13:20,814
Oh.

817
01:13:23,442 --> 01:13:25,027
Here you go.

818
01:13:25,277 --> 01:13:26,278
Oh.

819
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:28,280
To the range.

820
01:13:29,448 --> 01:13:31,492
What? Okay.

821
01:13:32,242 --> 01:13:34,912
Um, looks like I'm gonna go
deliver some dragon arrows.

822
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:36,598
Oh, you're gonna deliver
some dragon arrows?

823
01:13:36,622 --> 01:13:37,982
Yeah.
Make myself useful, you know.

824
01:13:38,082 --> 01:13:39,083
Thank you.

825
01:13:41,126 --> 01:13:42,836
Let's go see your mother.

826
01:13:57,518 --> 01:14:00,104
I just love how you guys know
exactly what you wanna do,

827
01:14:00,312 --> 01:14:03,107
and you spend your whole life
getting really good at it.

828
01:14:03,273 --> 01:14:04,858
I wish I was more like that.

829
01:14:05,025 --> 01:14:07,225
It's like every time I get
moderately good at something,

830
01:14:07,277 --> 01:14:09,530
I just quit
and start something new.

831
01:14:09,696 --> 01:14:11,615
But I just know my own limits,

832
01:14:11,782 --> 01:14:14,409
and I'm not gonna waste
my time chasing something

833
01:14:14,493 --> 01:14:16,373
that will ultimately be
a disappointment for me.

834
01:14:16,411 --> 01:14:17,454
That's not me.

835
01:14:52,114 --> 01:14:53,740
You were everything to her.

836
01:14:55,409 --> 01:14:57,870
She knew that one day
you would find your way here

837
01:14:58,036 --> 01:15:00,789
and asked me to prepare
something for your arrival.

838
01:15:23,353 --> 01:15:25,272
After losing someone like her,

839
01:15:25,355 --> 01:15:27,983
it's easy to feel alone
in this world.

840
01:15:28,650 --> 01:15:30,319
But you're not.

841
01:15:30,485 --> 01:15:32,738
You are children of this family,

842
01:15:33,322 --> 01:15:35,657
and I welcome you home.

843
01:16:36,051 --> 01:16:37,261
Guang Bo, you saw that?

844
01:16:38,011 --> 01:16:39,346
That was tight!

845
01:16:52,734 --> 01:16:54,653
My mother was the only one
who could beat him.

846
01:16:56,238 --> 01:16:58,031
Show me how she did it.

847
01:17:05,289 --> 01:17:06,790
No, sorry.

848
01:17:06,957 --> 01:17:08,542
Sorry. Offside, offside.

849
01:18:09,269 --> 01:18:11,480
Your mother knew who she was.

850
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:13,398
Do you?

851
01:19:19,423 --> 01:19:22,467
You are a product
of all who came before you.

852
01:19:23,427 --> 01:19:27,264
The legacy of your family,
the good and the bad,

853
01:19:28,056 --> 01:19:30,392
it is all a part of who you are.

854
01:19:34,771 --> 01:19:36,857
Stop hiding, nephew.

855
01:19:37,691 --> 01:19:39,734
It only prolongs the pain.

856
01:20:21,151 --> 01:20:22,152
Sir.

857
01:20:24,821 --> 01:20:26,323
The men are ready.

858
01:20:27,365 --> 01:20:29,159
The passage will open at dawn.

859
01:20:30,118 --> 01:20:31,745
I'll prepare the vehicles.

860
01:23:37,806 --> 01:23:39,015
Mama.

861
01:23:41,643 --> 01:23:42,811
Mama.

862
01:24:01,329 --> 01:24:02,539
Papa.

863
01:26:33,273 --> 01:26:34,482
We found the man

864
01:26:34,566 --> 01:26:36,651
responsible for killing
your mother.

865
01:26:37,861 --> 01:26:40,947
It is your right
to finish this for both of us.

866
01:26:42,073 --> 01:26:43,700
And when you return,

867
01:26:43,867 --> 01:26:47,370
we will rebuild The Ten Rings
to what it once was.

868
01:27:08,892 --> 01:27:10,518
Been looking everywhere for ya.

869
01:27:18,443 --> 01:27:19,652
You okay?

870
01:27:24,032 --> 01:27:27,410
I'm not who you think I am.

871
01:27:27,577 --> 01:27:29,412
You already apologised
for that. We're good...

872
01:27:29,579 --> 01:27:31,539
That's not what
I'm talking about.

873
01:27:33,833 --> 01:27:35,043
Okay.

874
01:27:36,628 --> 01:27:38,421
What... What is it?

875
01:27:44,010 --> 01:27:48,848
When my dad sent me to find
the man who killed my mom...

876
01:27:51,559 --> 01:27:53,770
I told you
I couldn't go through with it.

877
01:27:58,816 --> 01:28:00,318
I lied.

878
01:28:04,572 --> 01:28:06,866
I thought that
I could change my name,

879
01:28:07,033 --> 01:28:09,953
start a new life, pretend like
it never happened.

880
01:28:10,119 --> 01:28:11,329
But...

881
01:28:18,252 --> 01:28:20,505
She would hate
the person I've become.

882
01:28:27,220 --> 01:28:29,430
Your dad trained you
to be an assassin

883
01:28:29,514 --> 01:28:31,432
when you were seven.

884
01:28:32,183 --> 01:28:35,770
He sent you on a hit at 14.

885
01:28:37,730 --> 01:28:40,108
You realise how messed up
that is, right?

886
01:28:43,736 --> 01:28:46,239
My mom is dead because of him.

887
01:28:49,200 --> 01:28:51,953
And now he's coming
to destroy her home.

888
01:29:07,510 --> 01:29:09,262
What are you saying?

889
01:29:12,807 --> 01:29:15,018
I'm gonna do
what he trained me to do.

890
01:29:21,024 --> 01:29:22,567
I'm gonna kill him.

891
01:30:10,031 --> 01:30:11,032
He's here.

892
01:31:21,644 --> 01:31:23,229
Are you here to help the people

893
01:31:23,312 --> 01:31:25,773
holding your own mother captive?

894
01:31:26,190 --> 01:31:27,775
She isn't back there.

895
01:31:28,151 --> 01:31:29,152
You're being lied to

896
01:31:29,235 --> 01:31:31,404
by a creature
who wants to destroy us all.

897
01:31:32,864 --> 01:31:34,949
Is that what they told you?

898
01:31:35,533 --> 01:31:38,161
I know my wife's voice.

899
01:31:38,369 --> 01:31:40,913
I miss my sister
as much as you do,

900
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:43,666
but this is not the way
to honour her memory.

901
01:31:43,833 --> 01:31:45,626
Did you honour her
when you turned her away

902
01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:46,711
from your gate?

903
01:32:02,435 --> 01:32:04,061
Let me pass.

904
01:32:04,395 --> 01:32:06,439
We cannot do that.

905
01:32:25,416 --> 01:32:26,584
Burn it down.

906
01:33:30,523 --> 01:33:31,649
Stop him!

907
01:34:07,268 --> 01:34:10,271
Are you planning to stop me
all by yourself?

908
01:34:14,608 --> 01:34:16,027
I'm not afraid of you.

909
01:34:23,326 --> 01:34:24,535
Yes, you are.

910
01:34:30,166 --> 01:34:33,586
You've spent
your entire life afraid.

911
01:34:33,753 --> 01:34:35,796
Always running,

912
01:34:35,963 --> 01:34:37,256
always hiding.

913
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:54,648
You were there
when they came for her,

914
01:34:54,815 --> 01:34:56,984
and you did nothing.

915
01:34:57,568 --> 01:35:00,446
You stood at a window
and watched her die!

916
01:35:35,272 --> 01:35:36,982
She was gone and we needed you.

917
01:35:38,192 --> 01:35:41,404
But you chose those damn rings
over us.

918
01:35:45,491 --> 01:35:46,992
You trained your son
to be a killer.

919
01:35:48,202 --> 01:35:49,328
Is this what you wanted?

920
01:36:06,720 --> 01:36:08,389
Even if you could
bring her back,

921
01:36:10,182 --> 01:36:12,810
what makes you think she'd
want anything to do with you?

922
01:37:49,615 --> 01:37:50,824
He breached the gate!

923
01:37:55,287 --> 01:37:56,556
Those things
are gonna kill us all

924
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:58,165
if we don't work together.

925
01:37:58,332 --> 01:38:00,376
You think I'm going to
fall for that?

926
01:38:00,543 --> 01:38:02,711
Your weapons are useless
against them.

927
01:38:03,170 --> 01:38:04,797
We don't need your help.

928
01:38:05,339 --> 01:38:07,591
We are the mighty Ten Rings,

929
01:38:07,675 --> 01:38:09,093
and any...

930
01:38:33,784 --> 01:38:36,370
We... We should work together.

931
01:38:36,537 --> 01:38:38,581
Release them.

932
01:38:38,747 --> 01:38:40,499
Release them!

933
01:38:46,255 --> 01:38:47,548
What are they doing?

934
01:38:47,715 --> 01:38:50,175
Stealing souls to
feed the Dweller-in-Darkness.

935
01:38:50,301 --> 01:38:51,677
If it grows strong enough,

936
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:53,200
it will break
right through the gate.

937
01:38:53,345 --> 01:38:55,306
That was just the beginning.

938
01:38:59,685 --> 01:39:00,936
I have to help my friends.

939
01:39:11,155 --> 01:39:12,364
To the lake! Let's go!

940
01:39:12,448 --> 01:39:13,657
Let's go!

941
01:39:15,784 --> 01:39:17,828
Hey, where's your brother?

942
01:39:17,995 --> 01:39:19,705
I was hoping you knew.

943
01:42:39,238 --> 01:42:41,156
You have to stop your father!

944
01:43:12,271 --> 01:43:14,398
She's not back there, Dad.

945
01:43:15,858 --> 01:43:19,695
Get out of my way, boy.

946
01:43:20,946 --> 01:43:21,947
No.

947
01:44:25,761 --> 01:44:27,012
Calm down, mate.

948
01:44:27,179 --> 01:44:28,659
I'm not dead,
it's just a performance.

949
01:44:28,805 --> 01:44:30,432
Now get down here
and play along.

950
01:47:13,804 --> 01:47:15,555
I have to save her.

951
01:47:17,265 --> 01:47:19,142
She's calling to me.

952
01:47:22,646 --> 01:47:24,231
I wish that were true.

953
01:47:27,359 --> 01:47:28,735
Dad, please.

954
01:47:31,279 --> 01:47:32,989
Your family needs you.

955
01:48:14,489 --> 01:48:15,574
Shit.

956
01:49:58,176 --> 01:49:59,469
It's headed for the village!

957
01:52:59,149 --> 01:53:00,900
I'm not leaving you again.

958
01:53:19,169 --> 01:53:20,462
Holy shit.

959
01:56:02,540 --> 01:56:03,666
<i>Tonight,</i>

960
01:56:03,750 --> 01:56:05,501
<i>we honour those
who gave their lives</i>

961
01:56:05,585 --> 01:56:07,378
so we might see another day.

962
01:56:08,921 --> 01:56:10,590
They were more than warriors.

963
01:56:11,716 --> 01:56:15,136
They were our mothers
and fathers,

964
01:56:15,303 --> 01:56:18,014
our sisters and brothers.

965
01:56:19,182 --> 01:56:22,518
And though we will always
hold on to their memories,

966
01:56:24,145 --> 01:56:28,691
tonight we release them
to rest with our ancestors.

967
01:56:42,205 --> 01:56:43,998
A thousand years ago,

968
01:56:44,457 --> 01:56:46,793
and a thousand years from now,

969
01:56:47,543 --> 01:56:50,380
we will always be together.

970
01:57:32,755 --> 01:57:34,424
<i>I seriously thought
we were going to die.</i>

971
01:57:34,590 --> 01:57:36,026
And I'd only learned
how to shoot a bow,

972
01:57:36,050 --> 01:57:37,301
like, a day earlier,

973
01:57:37,468 --> 01:57:38,594
now I'm on a battlefield,

974
01:57:38,678 --> 01:57:40,972
killing all these Soul Suckers
with Shaun's aunty,

975
01:57:41,139 --> 01:57:43,349
who's this awesome,
magical kung fu goddess.

976
01:57:43,516 --> 01:57:44,993
And I'm hanging on
to The Great Protector

977
01:57:45,017 --> 01:57:46,078
with my sister at this point,

978
01:57:46,102 --> 01:57:48,104
trying not to get eaten
by the Mega Soul Sucker.

979
01:57:48,271 --> 01:57:50,565
Oh, the Mega Soul Sucker
was such a nasty bitch.

980
01:57:50,732 --> 01:57:52,292
Yeah. It was trying
to eat our dragon's soul.

981
01:57:52,316 --> 01:57:53,377
Which would have allowed it

982
01:57:53,401 --> 01:57:54,503
to destroy the entire universe.

983
01:57:54,527 --> 01:57:55,528
Yeah.

984
01:57:55,611 --> 01:57:56,779
I only had one arrow left,

985
01:57:56,863 --> 01:57:58,740
and all I could hear
in the back of my mind

986
01:57:58,906 --> 01:58:00,366
was my mom's voice saying,

987
01:58:00,533 --> 01:58:02,744
"Just take the shot,
you little mooch!"

988
01:58:02,910 --> 01:58:05,413
And so, I aimed
right for the Sucker's throat

989
01:58:05,496 --> 01:58:07,415
- and I let her fly.
- She hit it dead on.

990
01:58:07,749 --> 01:58:09,083
And then Shaun used
the Ten Rings

991
01:58:09,167 --> 01:58:11,836
to do this crazy
Kamehameha fireball

992
01:58:11,919 --> 01:58:13,463
that exploded the thing...

993
01:58:13,546 --> 01:58:15,465
and he saved the world.

994
01:58:16,799 --> 01:58:19,635
Yeah, we, uh, lost
some good people that day...

995
01:58:21,804 --> 01:58:23,139
but we made it.

996
01:58:23,639 --> 01:58:25,016
We made it.

997
01:58:26,726 --> 01:58:28,186
Are you done mocking me?

998
01:58:28,394 --> 01:58:30,229
Oh, no. We're not mocking you.

999
01:58:30,396 --> 01:58:31,773
So where is this sister
of yours?

1000
01:58:31,939 --> 01:58:33,858
She's back at my dad's compound,

1001
01:58:33,941 --> 01:58:35,109
shutting down his operations.

1002
01:58:35,276 --> 01:58:36,920
Yeah, his dad was the head
of The Ten Rings

1003
01:58:36,944 --> 01:58:38,446
for the past thousand years.

1004
01:58:39,989 --> 01:58:42,033
Two weeks ago, you were
parking cars for tips,

1005
01:58:42,200 --> 01:58:44,494
and you want me to believe
you're now saving the world

1006
01:58:44,660 --> 01:58:46,454
from soul-sucking monsters?

1007
01:58:47,121 --> 01:58:48,432
I know, you're trying
to get me back

1008
01:58:48,456 --> 01:58:50,696
for what I said last time,
but I'm not gonna apologise...

1009
01:58:51,292 --> 01:58:52,770
for speaking the truth
as a friend.

1010
01:58:52,794 --> 01:58:55,421
I really meant what I said,
and, in fact, I actually think

1011
01:58:55,588 --> 01:58:57,924
this whole bit you're doing
just further proves my point.

1012
01:58:58,090 --> 01:58:59,217
You guys are obviously...

1013
01:59:00,510 --> 01:59:02,136
- What?
- Shang-Chi.

1014
01:59:04,889 --> 01:59:06,182
Shang-Chi.

1015
01:59:07,266 --> 01:59:08,810
Uh... Here.

1016
01:59:08,976 --> 01:59:09,977
Present.

1017
01:59:13,689 --> 01:59:14,816
My name is Wong.

1018
01:59:16,067 --> 01:59:18,236
Yeah, I know, sir.
I'm a huge fan...

1019
01:59:18,402 --> 01:59:19,862
Do you have the rings?

1020
01:59:21,364 --> 01:59:22,824
Uh... Yeah, yes.

1021
01:59:22,990 --> 01:59:25,952
Good. Let's go,
we have a lot to talk about.

1022
01:59:26,452 --> 01:59:27,537
You too.

1023
01:59:30,331 --> 01:59:31,332
Me too?

1024
01:59:34,544 --> 01:59:36,504
- I think we should...
- Yeah.

1025
01:59:36,587 --> 01:59:38,881
- Uh, we gotta go.
- Yeah.

1026
01:59:40,174 --> 01:59:43,594
I know this is, like, crazy,
but I'm gonna text you,

1027
01:59:43,761 --> 01:59:46,639
and we'll do this again.
Nice to see you, John.

1028
01:59:46,806 --> 01:59:48,683
I'll Venmo you for the...

1029
02:02:00,064 --> 02:02:01,273
Hmm.

1030
02:02:02,650 --> 02:02:05,778
They don't match any artefacts
from our codex.

1031
02:02:07,154 --> 02:02:08,572
What do you think?

1032
02:02:08,656 --> 02:02:10,533
Mm, I'm not sure.

1033
02:02:12,827 --> 02:02:15,955
They're not vibranium.
Chitauri?

1034
02:02:17,373 --> 02:02:19,792
Not like any alien tech
I've seen.

1035
02:02:20,793 --> 02:02:21,979
How long did your dad have them

1036
02:02:22,003 --> 02:02:23,504
before he gave them to you?

1037
02:02:24,714 --> 02:02:26,007
Um...

1038
02:02:26,090 --> 02:02:27,675
About a thousand years.

1039
02:02:27,967 --> 02:02:29,677
Their thermoluminescence
indicates

1040
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:31,095
they're older than that.

1041
02:02:31,303 --> 02:02:32,888
By a lot.

1042
02:02:33,139 --> 02:02:35,391
The first time
you used the rings,

1043
02:02:35,766 --> 02:02:38,185
we felt it in Kamar-Taj.

1044
02:02:46,902 --> 02:02:48,362
What is it?

1045
02:02:48,487 --> 02:02:49,947
A beacon.

1046
02:02:50,114 --> 02:02:52,033
They're sending a message.

1047
02:02:53,743 --> 02:02:55,786
A message to where?

1048
02:02:58,330 --> 02:03:00,332
I'm so sorry.
I have to deal with this.

1049
02:03:00,541 --> 02:03:01,685
You can get my number
from Bruce.

1050
02:03:01,709 --> 02:03:03,127
It was so nice to meet you.

1051
02:03:04,920 --> 02:03:07,339
Yeah, I...
I don't have her number.

1052
02:03:07,757 --> 02:03:09,925
She... She does this a lot.

1053
02:03:10,676 --> 02:03:12,887
Guys, stay safe.

1054
02:03:13,846 --> 02:03:16,098
Welcome to the circus.

1055
02:03:22,772 --> 02:03:25,316
I know this is a lot to take in,

1056
02:03:25,483 --> 02:03:27,943
but you're gonna have
to start getting used to that.

1057
02:03:28,444 --> 02:03:31,489
From now on,
the trajectory of your lives

1058
02:03:31,655 --> 02:03:34,742
will be like nothing you've
ever experienced before.

1059
02:03:35,576 --> 02:03:37,578
And there's no going back.

1060
02:03:39,497 --> 02:03:41,665
You both have a long journey
ahead of you.

1061
02:03:42,458 --> 02:03:45,086
Go home, get some rest.

1062
02:03:47,129 --> 02:03:48,506
Yeah. That's a good idea.

1063
02:03:48,589 --> 02:03:51,634
Yeah. Yeah,
we probably should do that.

1064
02:03:53,135 --> 02:03:54,512
Or...

1065
02:10:59,186 --> 02:11:00,479
They're waiting.

1066
02:11:27,839 --> 02:11:29,049
Let's get started.

1067
02:11:29,216 --> 02:11:30,717
We have a lot of work to do.
