No. Sorry, it keeps me motivated.

Well, it's giving me day-mares.

25
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:06,149
{\an8}This is everything I could find
even remotely related to increasing speed.

26
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:10,403
{\an8}How are these supposed to help
apply the speed equation to you?

27
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,155
{\an8}The answer's got to be here somewhere.

28
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:13,615
{\an8}I think I found something interesting.

29
00:01:13,781 --> 00:01:16,409
{\an8}Good interesting or bad interesting?
'Cause that word could go either way.

30
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:20,037
{\an8}After running some comparative data,
it appears that you, Reverse-Flash,

31
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,251
{\an8}and Zoom are moving your legs at,
essentially, the same speed.

32
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,378
{\an8}Then why are they so much faster than him?

33
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:29,964
{\an8}Best I can tell, with each stride,
their feet spend less time on the ground,

34
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:32,550
{\an8}thus propelling them forward much faster.

35
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,219
{\an8}By almost 30%.

36
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:38,431
{\an8}Great. All right, well,
I gotta make up that difference somehow.

00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:46,648

39
00:01:46,814 --> 00:01:48,983
{\an8}I want to stop Jay
just as badly as you do.

40
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:50,152
{\an8}Right.

41
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:54,947
{\an8}But what if the reason you haven't been
able to run as fast as him yet

42
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,366
is because you just can't?

43
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,292
Barry, you know what happened to Jay
is not your fault, right?

44
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:07,960

It's not that big a deal.

It's a great opportunity
and you should take it,

how they increased horsepower,

If Thawne figures out that it's you,

140
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:05,698
the timeline will be altered,

141
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,158
people can die.

Others could live, and no one will know
who or what will be affected,

00:06:10,077 --> 00:06:13,790
but I promise you, when you come back
things will be different.

144

And only you will know
what those differences are.

to stop Zoom, then so be it.

I have to do this, you guys.

157
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,916
Okay. Let's go for it.

158
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:59,418
CISCO: <i>Okay,
you're gonna go back to the time</i>

159
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:03,339
<i>when Wells was distracted by the return
of the major jackass, Hartley Rathaway.</i>

160
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:07,259
<i>This is the first time we found out
Wells knew the accelerator might explode,</i>

161
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:09,011
<i>and we were all angry with him.</i>

162
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,764
<i>So, anything that might seem odd
about your behavior,</i>

163
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:13,516
<i>Wells should attribute to that.</i>

164
00:07:14,308 --> 00:07:17,437
<i>Also, remember,
do not underestimate Hartley.</i>

165
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:18,730
<i>He almost killed you.</i>

166
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:22,108
This is a tranq dart that should knock
old-you out for about six hours.

167
00:07:22,274 --> 00:07:23,985
Which lines up perfectly
for when you're going back,

168
00:07:24,151 --> 00:07:25,487
because not much was happening,

169
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:28,197
until Hartley attacks
the Cleveland Dam that night.

170
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:31,493
{\an8}<i>So, that should give you time
to learn what you need and return.</i>

171
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:35,747
CISCO: <i>One more thing, you cannot tell us
the truth about Wells. No matter what.</i>

172
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,415
<i>You must keep the timeline intact.</i>

173
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,044
It's gonna be hard to course-correct
if anything gets altered.

174
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:45,297
So, get what you need, and come back,
preferably to this moment,

175
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,467
this exact time you're leaving,
or else you might set off

-No pressure.
-Yeah, cool.

179

about Hartley in there, Mr. Allen.

Well, I've been learning
different techniques involved in running,

251
00:12:29,706 --> 00:12:32,960
and I was thinking that there's
just as much science involved in speed

00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,420
as anything physical or technical.

00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,977
Okay, look. I'm sorry.

313
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:04,273
Let me, uh,
just take care of all this, okay?

314
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,275
I'll talk to you later, I promise.

315
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,776
Fine.

316
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,487
But soon.

317
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,865
Soon, yeah.

318
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,042
What's going on?

319
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,877
CISCO: Oh, you know, just trying to
figure out how to find this Dementor

320
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,215
that's apparently roaming
through Central City, right now.

321
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:30,966
I assume that was the cause
of the C.C.P.D. alarm?

322
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,470
Yeah. Actually, it attacked my lab.

323
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:35,762
CAITLIN: You saw it?

324
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,639
No, I didn't see it. No, I did...

325
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:42,228
Um, well, I didn't get there in time,
but I have seen it before.

326
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,188
Where?

327
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:48,275
It was earlier today, actually,
when I was running to take Hartley down.

328
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,487
Uh-huh. You're just mentioning this now?

329
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:52,946
I didn't...
I mean, I didn't know what it was.

330
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:56,117
I thought it was some sort of illusion?
I don't know.

331
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,077
Okay, well we need to find it
before it hurts somebody.

332
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,328
Yeah, can you track it?

333
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:00,579
What is it with you guys?

334
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:01,997
It's like you think
I have ESP or something.

335
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,458
I can't just magically sense
where things are.

336
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,792
What can you do, Cisco?

337
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:08,962
I'm thinking I can reconfigure the
S.T.A.R. Labs satellite to look for it.

338
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,756
It might take some time, though.

339
00:18:10,922 --> 00:18:11,923
Do it.

340
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:15,136
In the meantime, Mr. Allen,
come with me.

341
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,512
Have a seat.

342
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,180
Is this about the speed equation?

343
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,766
Matter of fact, it is.

344
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,601
Great, okay, good.

345
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,061
-So, you've figured it out?
-Mmm-hmm.

346
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:26,647
(GRUNTS)

347
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,235
Yes.

348
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:33,195
I figured it out.

349
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,464
Now, who are you?

350
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,426
I mean, who are you, really?

351
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,345
Dr. Wells, what are you doing?

352
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,891
None of it adds up.

353
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,686
The interference with the comms.

354
00:19:05,852 --> 00:19:08,647
The speed equation. The Time Wraith.

355
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,900
<i>That's what we call them.</i>

356
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,109
Time Wraiths.

357
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,946
Scary, aren't they?

358
00:19:16,112 --> 00:19:18,657
I thought,
"Oh, no, a Time Wraith has found me."

359
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:20,992
But then I thought, "No, no, no.

360
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,911
"You know what you're doing."

361
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:26,332
"No, the Time Wraith is after someone
who's traveled through time,

362
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,752
"and doesn't know what they're doing."

363

(LAUGHING)

364
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,345
Dr. Wells, come on, it's me, it's Barry.
I don't...

365
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:40,512
DR. WELLS: <i>Really?</i>

366
00:19:41,012 --> 00:19:42,681
You are good.

367
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,935
You are good,
and I would believe you, except that...

368
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:51,857
Nothing?

369
00:19:52,023 --> 00:19:55,151
I move like this, you barely flinch.

370
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,366
You know who I am.

371
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,869
Don't you?

372
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:07,873
Oh... (LAUGHING)

373
00:20:08,164 --> 00:20:10,834
And you're from the future.
Do you know how I know that?

374
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:15,631
Because I haven't taught my Barry Allen
how to phase through objects. Yet.

375
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,758
(LAUGHING)

376
00:20:19,926 --> 00:20:21,220
Let me out of here, Thawne.

377
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,893
I know.

378
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,438
You're upset.

379
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:33,565
But it does me good
to hear that name again.

380
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:35,901
Now, onto the bigger question.

381
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:37,694
Why are you here?

382
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:41,407
Because I want to go faster,
and you're the only one who can teach me.

383
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,743
You're the only one
who's figured out the equation.

384
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:47,078
The Speed Force.

385
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:49,915
You've manipulated it.

386
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:51,917
How did you do that?

387
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,593
No.

388
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:05,389
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no, no.</i>

389
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:06,682
<i>No.</i>

390
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,603
You'd only come here
if something went wrong.

391
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,606
If you're still alive,

392
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:17,651
then that means...

393
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,951
I haven't beaten you.

394
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,830
If you're still alive,

395
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,167
that means my plan fails.

396
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:38,088
And if my plan fails,

397
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,884
I don't get to go home,
and if that's the case, well then...

398
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,345
No, no, no! Hey, hey!

399
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,262
It's the opposite, it's the opposite!

400

<i>You trick me, you harness my speed.</i>

401
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:51,727
We turn on the accelerator
to create a path for you to go home.

402
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,979
I go back in time.

403
00:21:54,145 --> 00:21:56,147
You go back to yours.

404
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,149
You won.

405
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,821
Yeah.

406
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:05,281
Then why are you here?

407
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,867
Why are you here, now?

408
00:22:07,033 --> 00:22:09,160
Because when I got back,
a Singularity had formed.

409
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:12,038
And now, the only way for me to learn
how to get faster

410
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:16,335
and stop the Singularity from happening
was to come here, now.

411
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,170
Well, that's good to know.

You probably should have thought of that,

421
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,540
before you came back here.

422
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,207
Shame.

423
00:22:56,708 --> 00:23:00,211
You ran all the way back here

424
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:02,923
just to die.

to emit a destructive signal

475
00:26:00,391 --> 00:26:01,559
if they were ever disarmed.

476
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,228
(SHRIEKING)

477
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,190
If I can just find the right frequency
of whatever the hell that thing is,

478
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:09,610
well, let's just say you'll be glad
you're in here with me.

479
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:13,071
-(LOUD BUZZING)
-(SHRIEKING)

480
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,081
(BOTH PANTING)

481
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:31,256
I'm sorry that we didn't come sooner.

482
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,635
It's alright, Inky's gone.
I don't see anything.

483
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:38,221
You know, we'd be toast if it wasn't
for Hartley and those gauntlets.

484
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:39,848
Well, self-preservation
is a very strong motivator,

485
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,058
but he stays in the cell
until I say otherwise.

486
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:43,601
Okay, I'm just saying.

487
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:46,688
So, the two places the thing
has attacked are here and C.C.P.D.

488
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,439
-The common denominator being...
-Me.

489
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:50,566
Yeah, I know. I just... I don't know why.

490
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,277
Well, you must've done something
to piss him off.

491
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:54,279
<i>Satellite hasn't found anything.</i>

492
00:26:54,445 --> 00:26:56,406
We need to find a more permanent solution
to this problem.

493
00:26:56,572 --> 00:26:58,616
Start by repairing Hartley's gauntlets.

494
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,744
That's as good a first step as any.

495
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:02,788
-I got some parts for it.
-Let's go for it.

496
00:27:04,455 --> 00:27:06,291
-You don't know how to stop a Time Wraith?
-None of us do,

497
00:27:06,457 --> 00:27:08,334
that's why we always
try and avoid them in our travels.

498
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:09,544
-We?
-Speedsters.

499
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:10,796
We're not the only two
out there, you know.

500
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,088
This isn't the first time
I've time-traveled.

501
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,924
How come I've never seen
one of these until now?

502
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,759
Because you ran out of luck.

503
00:27:16,342 --> 00:27:19,680
And Time Wraiths hate it
when speedsters manipulate the timeline,

504
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:22,974
and now that thing's gonna do
everything it can to end you.

505
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:24,392
(SCOFFS)

506
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,144
Here's what we're gonna do.

507
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:28,313
You're gonna go to C.C.P.D.,
you're gonna see what you can find

508
00:27:28,604 --> 00:27:30,356
to help us stop this thing,
I'll do the same here.

509
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:32,067
What am I supposed to be looking for?

510
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:33,484
You're in forensics, figure something out.

511
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:36,029
Hey, but what about the equation?
Me getting faster.

512
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,238
If we don't stop this thing,

513
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:39,866
there's gonna be no point
in me teaching you anything.

514
00:27:45,371 --> 00:27:47,791
No trace elements, no prints,

515
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:51,586
no sign that it was ever here,
except the whole mess.

516
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:53,296
Any idea what it was looking for?

517
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,381
-Me.
-What? Why?

518
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:57,508
It doesn't like something that I did.

519
00:27:57,675 --> 00:27:59,510
And what exactly would that be?

520
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,555
Joe, Singh needs you in his office.

521
00:28:06,727 --> 00:28:07,978
Hey, Eddie. Do you have a second?

522
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:09,687
I kinda gotta go,
check out a lead for Joe.

523
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:11,773
Okay, actually,
this is for Iris' birthday.

524
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:13,942
That's two months from now.

525
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,027
Yeah, no, I know, you're right. I just...

526
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,321
Um, I wanna make a video montage for her.

527
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:22,868
Just everybody in her life, and how her
being in your life has made it better.

528
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,120
That sounds great, yeah.
I'll think of something to say.

529
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:27,038
Can we do it now?

530
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,790
Barry, I really gotta go do this thing.

531
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:32,878
-I know, I kind of have to get it today.
-Sure.

532
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:36,131
All right, great.
Just, um, speak from the heart.

533
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:40,761
Talk as if it was the last thing
you could ever say to her.

534
00:28:42,428 --> 00:28:43,930
Okay.

535
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:47,517
Go ahead.

536
00:28:47,683 --> 00:28:50,896
What does Iris mean to me? Wow.

537
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,732
So, can these gauntlets be salvaged?

538
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:55,566
Their electron guns are fried.

539
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,236
So, it shorted the wave tubes,
destroyed the amplifiers.

540
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,905
Yeah, but, to be honest with you,

541
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:02,490
I don't know how to manipulate
the frequency variance.

542
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:05,326
Hartley would know.
He's the one who did it.

543
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:10,832
See if he can help,
but he stays in the cell.

544
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,542
But then what?
That thing's gonna come back.

545
00:29:12,708 --> 00:29:14,085
I don't know.

546
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:16,587
Where is he?

547
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,215
Where's the other Flash?

548
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:22,928
I'm right here.

549
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:34,605
Okay, not how I expected
today to turn out.

550
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:35,941
Yeah.

551
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:39,110
-Who are you?
-Who is he? Who are you?

552
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:43,824
-I'm Barry. I'm Barry. Your Barry. He's...
-Your doppelgänger.

553
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:45,283
No, not yet.

554
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:50,371
I am you, Barry. Just different.

555
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,916
Wait a second, how do we know
which one's the real Barry?

556
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:56,252
Dude, okay, I've watched <i>Wrath of Khan</i>
with you, like, five times.

557
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:57,503
Imposter.

558
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,630
Yeah, and every time at the end,
you turn to me and you say,

559
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,008
"I have been, and always shall be,
your friend."

560
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:04,260
Ah-ha! You imposter.

561
00:30:06,096 --> 00:30:07,513
What is going on here?

562
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,350
Okay, guys, I'm sorry.
This was not supposed to happen.

563
00:30:10,516 --> 00:30:12,894
The tranq dart that Caitlin made
was supposed to last a lot longer.

564
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,146
I did not give him a tranq dart.

565
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:19,275
Okay, no, yes. Not you.
The you from the time that I'm from.

566
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,486
The time that you're from?

567
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:25,073
I think what he's trying to say is,
he's from the future.

568
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,282
-The future?
-Yeah.

569
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,534
-The future? With the...
-Yes. Yes.

570
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:31,997
Are we saying I can time travel?

571
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:35,375
(SCOFFING) One day.

572
00:30:35,541 --> 00:30:37,836
Oh, that explains the white on the symbol.

573
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:40,255
But wait a second,
suppose we now change your emblem?

574
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:44,175
Will it be because we got the idea from
this, or, I mean, that would mean that...

575
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:46,761
Stop talking. You stop talking, too.
All right?

576
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,930
The more you say,
the more the timeline is disrupted.

577
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,681
Now, I'm going to assume
that your presence here

578
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:53,518
-is the reason that thing is attacking us?
-What? What thing?

579
00:30:53,684 --> 00:30:55,228
Have you ever seen <i>The Frighteners?</i>

580
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:58,857
It's sort of like that, but scarier,
and faster, and it's after you. After him.

581
00:30:59,024 --> 00:31:01,734
Yeah, it's been chasing me
ever since I got here.

582
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:03,945
-Okay, so how do we stop it?
-We don't know.

583
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,365
-Then what are we gonna do?
-The one thing we can.

584
00:31:10,826 --> 00:31:13,204
What? What are we doing here?

585
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:18,168
We're here for the answer
to your speed equation.

586
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:21,796
The reason that you
traveled back to this time.

587
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:24,966
And the key to running faster.

588
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:29,679
Tachyon enhancement.

589
00:31:29,845 --> 00:31:31,556
This was not the deal.

590
00:31:32,723 --> 00:31:35,894
If you think that I'm gonna
hold your hand this entire way,

591
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,145
you're sadly mistaken.

592
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,480
Everything you need is on this drive.

593
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:40,941
If you follow its instructions,

594
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:44,402
you will enhance the Speed Force
in your system and run faster

595
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:47,363
than you ever thought possible.

596
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:52,535
BARRY: <i>If this doesn't work,</i>

597
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,495
I'm coming back.

598
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,789
CISCO: <i>Doctor Wells, we need you.</i>

599
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,420
Time to go home, Flash.

600
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:09,760
Okay, our satellite has finally found
our floating friend, and it's coming back.

601
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,887
-You need to go.
-I need to know how to stop it.

602
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,806
-Barry.
-Not now.

603
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:15,976
When I get back,
you guys have a year to figure it out.

604
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:18,979
Okay, we'll figure something out.

605
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,481
Cisco, come here.

606
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:25,443
Hartley knows where Ronnie is.

607
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,652
Okay. What?

608
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,615
-It's coming.
-You need to leave, now.

609
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:50,676
Thank you.

610
00:32:58,643 --> 00:32:59,810
CISCO: <i>Barry, here it comes.</i>

611
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,575
(SHRIEKING)

612
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,625
It's not working, it's slowing him down.

613
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:24,544
Not for long.

614
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,213
No. Barry!

615
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:32,427
(GROWLING)

616
00:33:52,738 --> 00:33:55,116
(PANTING) Cool.

617
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,627
-It's coming.
-Did you even go?

618
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:08,629
-The Time Wraith.
-That's a good name.

619
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:11,006
-Looks like that's a "Yes."
-Did you figure out how to stop it?

620
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:14,552
(SHRIEKING)

621
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:18,389
Damn. We thought so.

622
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:26,772
Barry.

623
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:41,329
(SHRIEKING)

624
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:45,125
I suddenly realized.

625
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,585
Low frequency, high intensity.

626
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:51,297
-I knew that.
-Oh, hey, Barry. How was your trip?

627
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:00,055
So, aside from the fact that a Time Wraith

628
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,975
came over here and nearly killed us,
how did it go?

629
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:04,435
It was interesting.

630
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,937
Good interesting or bad interesting?
'Cause that could go either way.

631
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,525
-So far, so good.
-(SPEAKING LATIN)

632
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,069
{\an8}How many times
do we have to tell you, Hartley,

633
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,114
ever since evil Wells
got erased from existence,

634
00:35:16,281 --> 00:35:18,491
no one speaks Latin around here, anymore.

635
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:22,953
Well, as always, been a pleasure working
with you all on this little project.

636
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,206
If you need anything in the future,
call me.

637
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,376
-I'm off to a late dinner.
-Dinner? Anyone special?

638
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:30,461
Very.

639
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:31,837
My parents.

640
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,467
So? You got me on
pins and needles over here.

641
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:39,053
<i>What about the speed equation?
Did Wells tell you what you need to do?</i>

642
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,556
Well, let's see.

643
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:52,107
Mmm. Maybe it's password protected?

644
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,653
Are you kidding me?

645
00:35:56,237 --> 00:36:00,825
After everything I just went through,
this doesn't even work.

646
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,837
We got it.

647
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:17,300
Hey.

648
00:36:18,218 --> 00:36:19,552
-Hey.
-You okay?

649
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,720
Yeah, I'm okay.

650
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:24,349
Although, it turns out it's easier to find
a two-ton gorilla on this Earth

651
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,016
than a teenage daughter.

652
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,021
I don't know what I've done.

653
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:33,441
You did what you thought you had to do.

654
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,067
You risked your life to save her.

655
00:36:35,235 --> 00:36:37,278
You brought her here
to protect her from Zoom.

656
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,405
You acted like a father.

657
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,033
Like a father.

658
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:46,704
You know, my wife had to...

659
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,039
She had to talk me into having kids.

660
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:53,961
Kids, you know, they're small,
they're loud, run around.

661
00:36:54,169 --> 00:36:58,633
All I needed was my science,
my job, for my joy and happiness.

662
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,051
And then,

663
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:02,887
(SCOFFS)

664
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:07,182
the moment we had her,

665
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:11,896
all that I wanted was her love.

666
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:14,274
Now,

667
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:19,153
I don't know if I'll ever see that again.
It seems every decision I've made lately

668
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,780
has backfired on me.

669
00:37:21,947 --> 00:37:23,658
You just have to trust that
in the long run,

670
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,159
you've made the right ones.

671
00:37:34,084 --> 00:37:36,045
-Hey.
-IRIS: <i>Hey.</i>

672
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,673
<i>I put your plate from dinner
in the fridge.</i>

673
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,175
Thanks.

674
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:01,446
It's been almost a year already.
Can you believe that?

675
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:05,115
That's the thing, Iris.
Everything keeps moving forward.

676
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:08,786
The question is, when will you?

677
00:38:17,252 --> 00:38:19,254
I don't know, Barry.

678
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:24,635
Well, um, I found something
that I think might help.

679
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:31,642
I was putting together this little video
montage for your birthday last year

680
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,478
with everybody and...

681
00:38:35,145 --> 00:38:37,231
Everything happened. Um...

682
00:38:38,148 --> 00:38:42,528
But, uh, take a look.
I think it might help.

683
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,155
Okay.

684
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:52,413
<i>What does Iris mean to me? Wow.</i>

685
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:55,833
<i>You know, a lot of times</i>

686
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,253
<i>I have a hard time
figuring out what to say to people.</i>

687
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:02,340
<i>But, when it comes to you, Iris, I don't.</i>

688
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:06,677
<i>Because with you,
everything that used to feel tough</i>

689
00:39:07,177 --> 00:39:08,721
<i>just doesn't anymore.</i>

690
00:39:09,179 --> 00:39:11,516
<i>It's one of the things I love about you.</i>

691
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,768
<i>You don't need me.</i>

692
00:39:14,184 --> 00:39:18,523
<i>You can handle anything on your own,
because you're fearless.</i>

693
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:20,775
<i>And independent.</i>

694
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,610
<i>Loving.</i>

695
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,487
<i>Kind.</i>

696
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:31,869
<i>You are, without question,
the best decision I ever made, Iris West.</i>

697
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:36,165
<i>And I've never thanked you
for choosing to be with me,</i>

698
00:39:36,331 --> 00:39:40,670
<i>because each day with you is a gift.</i>

699
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,963
<i>So, thank you.</i>

700
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,632
<i>You deserve the world, Iris.</i>

701
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:46,842
<i>You deserve to be happy
the rest of your life.</i>

702
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:49,261
<i>And no one wants that more for you
than me.</i>

703
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:50,846
(SNIFFLING)

704
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,558
<i>Happy birthday, baby.</i>

705
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,976
<i>I love you.</i>

706
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:00,230
I love you, too.

707
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:07,279
BARRY: <i>Sometimes,
the only way to move forward</i>

708
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:10,700
<i>is to revisit the things in your past
that were holding you back.</i>

709
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:16,163
<i>You have to deal with them, head on,
no matter how scary they may be.</i>

710
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:21,251
<i>Because once you do, you'll see that
you can go further than you ever imagined.</i>

711
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:29,469
I'm coming for you.
