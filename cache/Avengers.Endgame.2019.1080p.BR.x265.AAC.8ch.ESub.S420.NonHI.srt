1
00:00:07,197 --> 00:00:10,999
Okay, hold on,
don't shoot.

2
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:13,134
- You see where you're going?
- Mm-hmm.

3
00:00:13,136 --> 00:00:14,068
Okay.

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,206
Now, let's worry
about how you get there.

5
00:00:16,906 --> 00:00:18,840
Gotta move
your foot here.

6
00:00:18,842 --> 00:00:20,643
Point your toe this way.

7
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,443
Your hips here.

8
00:00:22,445 --> 00:00:23,913
Okay?

9
00:00:24,547 --> 00:00:25,980
- Can you see?
- Yeah.

10
00:00:25,982 --> 00:00:27,115
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.

11
00:00:27,117 --> 00:00:28,650
How about now?
Can you see now?

12
00:00:28,652 --> 00:00:30,184
- No.
- How about now?

13
00:00:32,255 --> 00:00:33,323
All right.

14
00:00:33,857 --> 00:00:35,992
Ready? Three fingers.

15
00:00:36,593 --> 00:00:37,893
Nice!

16
00:00:39,362 --> 00:00:40,962
Nice throw, kiddo.

17
00:00:40,964 --> 00:00:42,330
Here you go.

18
00:00:42,332 --> 00:00:44,699
Hey, you guys
want mayo? Or mustard?

19
00:00:44,701 --> 00:00:46,501
Or both?

20
00:00:46,503 --> 00:00:48,603
Who puts mayo
on a hot dog?

21
00:00:48,605 --> 00:00:49,704
Probably your brothers.

22
00:00:49,706 --> 00:00:51,838
Uh, two mustard, please!
Thanks, Mama.

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,408
Got it!

24
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,044
Nate, mayo or mustard?

25
00:00:55,612 --> 00:00:57,110
How about ketchup?

26
00:00:57,112 --> 00:00:59,514
Or ketchup.
I got ketchup, too.

27
00:00:59,516 --> 00:01:00,583
Mind your elbow.

28
00:01:02,652 --> 00:01:04,752
Good job, hawk-eye.

29
00:01:04,754 --> 00:01:07,524
Go get your arrow.

30
00:01:09,626 --> 00:01:10,758
Hey, guys!

31
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,260
Enough practice.
Soup's on!

32
00:01:13,262 --> 00:01:14,227
All right.

33
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:15,864
We're coming.
We're hungry.

34
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:18,367
Lila, let's go.

35
00:01:21,403 --> 00:01:22,604
Lila?

36
00:01:25,541 --> 00:01:26,542
Honey?

37
00:01:30,446 --> 00:01:31,513
Hey, babe?

38
00:01:40,222 --> 00:01:42,424
Babe?

39
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,893
Babe?

40
00:01:46,662 --> 00:01:48,564
Boys!

41
00:01:50,366 --> 00:01:51,367
Boys!

42
00:01:53,635 --> 00:01:54,867
Laura!

43
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:20,612

46
00:02:38,746 --> 00:02:40,212
You don't need
to do that.

47
00:02:40,214 --> 00:02:43,150
Because, uh, you're just
holding the position.

48
00:02:43,984 --> 00:02:45,551
Oh, yeah.

49
00:02:45,553 --> 00:02:48,254
That was close.

50
00:02:48,256 --> 00:02:50,188
That's a goal.
We are now one apiece.

51
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,692
I would like to try again.

52
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,595
We're tied up.
Feel the tension?

53
00:02:56,597 --> 00:02:58,163
It's fun.

54
00:02:58,165 --> 00:03:00,367
That was terrible.
Now you have a chance to win.

55
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:02,570
And you've won.

56
00:03:03,638 --> 00:03:04,904
Congratulations.

57
00:03:04,906 --> 00:03:06,206
Fair game.

58
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:08,975
Good sport.

59
00:03:09,777 --> 00:03:11,278
You have fun?

60
00:03:12,946 --> 00:03:15,081
It was fun.

61
00:03:37,571 --> 00:03:39,206
This thing on?

62
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,343
Hey, Miss Potts. Pep.

63
00:03:44,411 --> 00:03:47,312
If you find this recording...

64
00:03:47,314 --> 00:03:50,180
don't post it on social media.

65
00:03:50,182 --> 00:03:52,484
It's gonna be
a real tearjerker.

66
00:03:52,486 --> 00:03:55,152
I don't know if you're
ever gonna see these.

67
00:03:55,154 --> 00:03:57,822
I don't even know
if you're still...

68
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,726
Oh, God, I hope so.

69
00:04:00,594 --> 00:04:02,927
<i>Today's day 21.</i>

70
00:04:02,929 --> 00:04:05,663
<i>No, uh, 22.</i>

71
00:04:05,665 --> 00:04:08,432
<i>You know, if it wasn't for
the existential terror...</i>

72
00:04:08,434 --> 00:04:10,634
<i>of staring into
the literal void of space,</i>

73
00:04:10,636 --> 00:04:13,170
<i>I'd say I'm feeling
a little better today.</i>

74
00:04:13,172 --> 00:04:14,538
<i>Infection's run its course,</i>

75
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,841
<i>thanks to
the Blue Meanie back there.</i>

76
00:04:16,843 --> 00:04:18,642
<i>Oh, you'd love her.</i>

77
00:04:18,644 --> 00:04:20,344
<i>Very practical.</i>

78
00:04:20,346 --> 00:04:22,615
<i>Only a tiny bit sadistic.</i>

79
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:29,620
<i>So, the fuel cells were
cracked during battle...</i>

80
00:04:29,622 --> 00:04:31,889
<i>and we figured out a way
to reverse the ion charge...</i>

81
00:04:31,891 --> 00:04:35,059
<i>and bought ourselves about
48 hours of flight time.</i>

82
00:04:38,162 --> 00:04:40,096
<i>Uh, but it's now dead
in the water.</i>

83
00:04:40,098 --> 00:04:43,702
<i>Thousand light years
from the nearest 7-Eleven.</i>

84
00:04:45,103 --> 00:04:47,606
<i>Oxygen will run out
tomorrow morning...</i>

85
00:04:49,008 --> 00:04:50,743
<i>and that'll be it.</i>

86
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:57,179
<i>Pep, I know I said
no more surprises...</i>

87
00:04:57,181 --> 00:04:59,016
<i>but I gotta say
I was really hoping</i>

88
00:04:59,018 --> 00:05:00,984
<i>to pull off one last one.</i>

89
00:05:00,986 --> 00:05:03,085
<i>But it looks like...</i>

90
00:05:03,087 --> 00:05:05,123
<i>Well, you know
what it looks like.</i>

91
00:05:06,257 --> 00:05:08,257
Don't feel bad about this.

92
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:11,895
I mean, actually, if you
grovel for a couple weeks...

93
00:05:11,897 --> 00:05:15,199
and then move on
with enormous guilt...

94
00:05:20,104 --> 00:05:22,171
I should probably lie down
for a minute.

95
00:05:22,173 --> 00:05:24,342
Go rest my eyes.

96
00:05:27,145 --> 00:05:29,745
Please know...

97
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:33,783
when I drift off, it'll be
like every night lately.

98
00:05:33,785 --> 00:05:36,754
I'm fine. Totally fine.

99
00:05:37,288 --> 00:05:38,723
I dream about you.

100
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,859
Because it's always you.

101
00:09:04,491 --> 00:09:05,824
Couldn't stop him.

102
00:09:05,826 --> 00:09:06,958
Neither could I.

103
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,295
Hang on.

104
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,299
I lost the kid.

105
00:09:14,735 --> 00:09:16,403
Tony, we lost.

106
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:19,640
Is, uh...?

107
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,342
- Oh, good.
- Oh, my God!

108
00:09:23,143 --> 00:09:24,878
Oh, my God!

109
00:09:29,716 --> 00:09:31,484
It's okay.

110
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,060
It's been 23 days
since Thanos came to Earth.

111
00:09:42,461 --> 00:09:45,130
World governments
are in pieces.

112
00:09:45,132 --> 00:09:47,098
The parts that are
still working...

113
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,871
...are trying to take a census
and it looks like he did...

114
00:09:53,472 --> 00:09:55,273
He did exactly what he said
he was gonna do.

115
00:09:55,275 --> 00:09:56,542
Thanos wiped out...

116
00:09:58,744 --> 00:10:02,014
...50% of all
living creatures.

117
00:10:06,286 --> 00:10:08,352
Where is he now? Where?

118
00:10:08,354 --> 00:10:10,054
We don't know.

119
00:10:10,056 --> 00:10:13,526
He just opened a portal
and walked through.

120
00:10:16,028 --> 00:10:17,063
What's wrong with him?

121
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,231
Oh, he's pissed.

122
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:21,701
He thinks he failed.

123
00:10:23,069 --> 00:10:24,201
Which, of course, he did...

124
00:10:24,203 --> 00:10:26,436
but there's a lot of that
going around, ain't there?

125
00:10:26,438 --> 00:10:27,838
Honestly,
until this exact second

126
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,273
I thought you were
a Build-A-Bear.

127
00:10:29,275 --> 00:10:30,674
Maybe I am.

128
00:10:30,676 --> 00:10:32,309
We've been hunting Thanos
for three weeks now.

129
00:10:32,311 --> 00:10:34,510
Deep space scans...

130
00:10:34,512 --> 00:10:36,682
and satellites,
and we got nothing.

131
00:10:38,317 --> 00:10:39,382
Tony, you fought him.

132
00:10:39,384 --> 00:10:40,585
Who told you that?

133
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,286
I didn't fight him.

134
00:10:42,288 --> 00:10:43,888
No, he wiped my face
with a planet...

135
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,289
while the Bleecker Street
magician

136
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:46,556
gave away the store.

137
00:10:46,558 --> 00:10:47,790
That's what happened.

138
00:10:47,792 --> 00:10:49,126
There was no fight,
'cause he's not beatable.

139
00:10:49,128 --> 00:10:51,996
Did he give you any clues,
any coordinates, anything?

140
00:10:51,998 --> 00:10:53,531
Uh...

141
00:10:54,733 --> 00:10:56,466
I saw this coming
a few years back.

142
00:10:56,468 --> 00:10:58,568
I had a vision.
I didn't wanna believe it.

143
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,271
Thought I was dreaming.

144
00:11:00,273 --> 00:11:01,404
Tony, I'm gonna
need you to focus.

145
00:11:01,406 --> 00:11:03,340
And I needed you.

146
00:11:03,342 --> 00:11:04,540
As in, past tense.

147
00:11:04,542 --> 00:11:08,044
That trumps what you need.
It's too late, buddy.

148
00:11:08,046 --> 00:11:09,712
Sorry.

149
00:11:09,714 --> 00:11:13,416
You know what I need?
I need a shave.

150
00:11:13,418 --> 00:11:16,019
And I believe I remember
telling all youse...

151
00:11:16,021 --> 00:11:16,986
Tony, Tony!

152
00:11:16,988 --> 00:11:20,556
...alive and otherwise,
that what we needed

153
00:11:20,558 --> 00:11:22,525
was a suit of armor
around the world.

154
00:11:22,527 --> 00:11:23,760
Remember that?

155
00:11:23,762 --> 00:11:26,396
Whether it impacted
our precious freedoms or not.

156
00:11:26,398 --> 00:11:27,730
That's what we needed.

157
00:11:27,732 --> 00:11:29,098
Well, that didn't
work out, did it?

158
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,565
I said we'd lose.

159
00:11:30,567 --> 00:11:33,336
You said, "We'll do that
together, too."

160
00:11:33,338 --> 00:11:34,737
And guess what, Cap?

161
00:11:34,739 --> 00:11:36,339
We lost.

162
00:11:36,341 --> 00:11:37,541
And you weren't there.

163
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,109
But that's what
we do, right?

164
00:11:40,111 --> 00:11:43,012
Our best work after the fact?
We're the "Avengers."

165
00:11:43,014 --> 00:11:45,315
We're the "Avengers,"
not the "Pre-vengers."

166
00:11:45,317 --> 00:11:46,448
- Okay.
- Right?

167
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:47,716
You made your point.
Just sit down, okay?

168
00:11:47,718 --> 00:11:49,018
Okay. No, no, here's my point.
You know what?

169
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,485
- She's great by the way.
- Tony, you're sick. Sit down.

170
00:11:50,487 --> 00:11:52,121
We need you.
You're new blood.

171
00:11:52,123 --> 00:11:55,325
Bunch of tired old mules.
I got nothing for you, Cap.

172
00:11:55,327 --> 00:11:56,692
I got no coordinates...

173
00:11:56,694 --> 00:11:59,628
no clues, no strategies,
no options.

174
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,530
Zero. Zip. Nada.

175
00:12:01,532 --> 00:12:03,534
No trust, liar.

176
00:12:07,972 --> 00:12:09,304
Here, take this.

177
00:12:09,306 --> 00:12:11,608
You find him,
you put that on...

178
00:12:11,976 --> 00:12:13,610
you hide.

179
00:12:14,645 --> 00:12:16,745
- Tony!
- I'm fine.

180
00:12:16,747 --> 00:12:18,515
Let me...

181
00:12:24,722 --> 00:12:26,121
Bruce gave him
a sedative.

182
00:12:26,123 --> 00:12:28,123
He's gonna probably be out
for the rest of the day.

183
00:12:28,926 --> 00:12:30,624
You guys
take care of him...

184
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:32,706
and I'll bring him a Xorrian
elixir when I come back.

185
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:34,062
Where are you going?

186
00:12:34,064 --> 00:12:35,798
To kill Thanos.

187
00:12:38,634 --> 00:12:39,867
Hey.

188
00:12:39,869 --> 00:12:42,104
You know, we usually work
as a team here...

189
00:12:42,106 --> 00:12:43,972
and, uh, between you and I,
morale's a little fragile.

190
00:12:43,974 --> 00:12:46,574
We realize up there
is more your territory,

191
00:12:46,576 --> 00:12:47,775
but this is
our fight, too.

192
00:12:47,777 --> 00:12:49,244
You even know
where he is?

193
00:12:49,246 --> 00:12:50,511
I know people who might.

194
00:12:50,513 --> 00:12:51,981
Don't bother.

195
00:12:52,749 --> 00:12:54,751
I can tell you
where Thanos is.

196
00:12:56,986 --> 00:13:00,654
Thanos spent a long time
trying to perfect me.

197
00:13:00,656 --> 00:13:04,825
And when he worked,
he talked about his Great Plan.

198
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:08,229
Even disassembled,
I wanted to please him.

199
00:13:08,231 --> 00:13:09,997
I'd ask...

200
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:13,334
where would we go
once his plan was complete?

201
00:13:13,336 --> 00:13:15,538
And his answer
was always the same.

202
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:21,042
"To the Garden."

203
00:13:21,044 --> 00:13:24,145
That's cute.
Thanos has a retirement plan.

204
00:13:24,147 --> 00:13:25,813
So, where is he?

205
00:13:25,815 --> 00:13:28,049
When Thanos snapped
his fingers...

206
00:13:28,051 --> 00:13:30,317
Earth became ground zero
for a power surge

207
00:13:30,319 --> 00:13:32,286
of ridiculously
cosmic proportions.

208
00:13:32,288 --> 00:13:34,587
No one's ever seen
anything like it.

209
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:36,059
Until two days ago...

210
00:13:37,927 --> 00:13:39,594
on this planet.

211
00:13:40,163 --> 00:13:41,763
Thanos is there.

212
00:13:43,332 --> 00:13:45,299
He used the stones again.

213
00:13:45,301 --> 00:13:46,966
Hey, hey, hey.

214
00:13:46,968 --> 00:13:49,069
We'd be going in
shorthanded, you know?

215
00:13:49,071 --> 00:13:50,703
Look, he's still
got the stones, so...

216
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,473
So, let's get 'em.

217
00:13:52,475 --> 00:13:54,107
Use them to bring
everyone back.

218
00:13:54,109 --> 00:13:55,309
Just like that?

219
00:13:55,311 --> 00:13:56,910
Yeah. Just like that.

220
00:13:56,912 --> 00:14:00,180
Even if there's a small chance
that we can undo this...

221
00:14:00,182 --> 00:14:03,283
I mean, we owe it to everyone
who's not in this room to try.

222
00:14:03,285 --> 00:14:04,851
If we do this,
how do we know

223
00:14:04,853 --> 00:14:07,387
it's gonna end any differently
than it did before?

224
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,091
Because before
you didn't have me.

225
00:14:09,991 --> 00:14:11,057
Hey, new girl?

226
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:14,661
Everybody in this room
is about that superhero life.

227
00:14:14,663 --> 00:14:15,829
And if you don't mind
my asking,

228
00:14:15,831 --> 00:14:17,097
where the hell
have you been all this time?

229
00:14:17,099 --> 00:14:19,265
There are a lot of other
planets in the universe.

230
00:14:19,267 --> 00:14:22,370
And unfortunately,
they didn't have you guys.

231
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,159
I like this one.

232
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:51,165
Let's go get
this son of a bitch.

233
00:15:12,987 --> 00:15:14,319
Okay.

234
00:15:14,321 --> 00:15:16,824
Who here hasn't been
to space?

235
00:15:17,925 --> 00:15:19,158
Why?

236
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,226
You better not throw up
on my ship.

237
00:15:21,228 --> 00:15:22,662
Approaching jump in three...

238
00:15:22,997 --> 00:15:24,865
two, one.

239
00:15:38,112 --> 00:15:40,079
<i>I'll head down for recon.</i>

240
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,164
This is gonna work, Steve.

241
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,834
I know it will.

242
00:16:05,305 --> 00:16:08,206
'Cause I don't know what
I'm gonna do if it doesn't.

243
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:11,943
<i>No satellites.
No ships. No armies.</i>

244
00:16:11,945 --> 00:16:13,746
<i>No ground defenses
of any kind.</i>

245
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:17,350
<i>It's just him.</i>

246
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,852
And that's enough.

247
00:17:48,707 --> 00:17:50,074
Oh, no.

248
00:17:59,785 --> 00:18:01,250
Where are they?

249
00:18:01,252 --> 00:18:03,254
Answer the question.

250
00:18:05,623 --> 00:18:08,123
The universe
required correction.

251
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:12,261
After that, the stones
served no purpose...

252
00:18:12,263 --> 00:18:13,896
beyond temptation.

253
00:18:13,898 --> 00:18:16,831
You murdered trillions!

254
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:19,270
You should be grateful.

255
00:18:22,673 --> 00:18:24,740
Where are the stones?

256
00:18:24,742 --> 00:18:26,375
Gone.

257
00:18:26,377 --> 00:18:27,975
Reduced to atoms.

258
00:18:27,977 --> 00:18:29,712
You used them two days ago!

259
00:18:29,714 --> 00:18:33,083
I used the stones
to destroy the stones.

260
00:18:33,684 --> 00:18:35,386
It nearly killed me.

261
00:18:36,721 --> 00:18:38,853
But the work is done.

262
00:18:38,855 --> 00:18:41,592
It always will be.

263
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:46,564
I am inevitable.

264
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:51,232
We have to tear this place apart.
He has to be lying!

265
00:18:51,234 --> 00:18:52,603
My father
is many things.

266
00:18:53,503 --> 00:18:55,572
A liar is not one of them.

267
00:18:57,607 --> 00:18:58,942
Ah.

268
00:18:59,576 --> 00:19:01,044
Thank you, daughter.

269
00:19:03,747 --> 00:19:05,882
Perhaps I treated you
too harshly.

270
00:19:12,288 --> 00:19:13,289
What?

271
00:19:13,823 --> 00:19:15,625
What did you do?

272
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:19,095
I went for the head.

273
00:20:29,832 --> 00:20:32,166
<i>So...</i>

274
00:20:33,234 --> 00:20:35,936
...I, uh, went on a date
the other day.

275
00:20:35,938 --> 00:20:37,804
It's the first time
in five years.

276
00:20:37,806 --> 00:20:40,274
You know? I'm sitting there
at dinner.

277
00:20:41,242 --> 00:20:43,444
I didn't even know
what to talk about.

278
00:20:44,713 --> 00:20:46,278
What did you talk about?

279
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,751
Eh, same old crap. You know,
how things have changed.

280
00:20:50,451 --> 00:20:52,153
My job, his job.

281
00:20:52,955 --> 00:20:55,056
How much we miss the Mets.

282
00:20:57,191 --> 00:20:59,026
And then things got quiet...

283
00:21:00,995 --> 00:21:04,730
then he cried as they were
serving the salads.

284
00:21:04,732 --> 00:21:06,334
What about you?

285
00:21:07,201 --> 00:21:10,605
I cried just before dessert.

286
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:16,511
But I'm seeing him
again tomorrow, so...

287
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:18,377
That's great.

288
00:21:18,379 --> 00:21:20,178
You did the hardest part.
You took the jump.

289
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,982
You didn't know where
you were gonna come down.

290
00:21:22,984 --> 00:21:24,950
And that's it.
That's those little

291
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:27,353
brave baby steps
we gotta take...

292
00:21:27,355 --> 00:21:31,324
to try and become whole again,
try and find purpose.

293
00:21:32,994 --> 00:21:34,493
I went in the ice in '45,

294
00:21:34,495 --> 00:21:37,197
right after I met
the love of my life.

295
00:21:37,899 --> 00:21:39,700
Woke up 70 years later.

296
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:45,038
You gotta move on.

297
00:21:47,607 --> 00:21:49,309
Gotta move on.

298
00:21:53,981 --> 00:21:56,648
The world is in our hands.

299
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:58,850
It's left to us, guys.

300
00:21:58,852 --> 00:22:01,221
And we gotta do
something with it.

301
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:03,323
Otherwise...

302
00:22:04,357 --> 00:22:06,826
Thanos should've killed
all of us.

303
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:10,255
What the hell?

304
00:23:22,468 --> 00:23:23,769
Hope?

305
00:23:56,934 --> 00:23:58,068
Kid!

306
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,303
Hey, kid!

307
00:24:03,374 --> 00:24:05,743
What the hell happened here?

308
00:24:37,274 --> 00:24:39,309
Oh, my God!

309
00:24:41,979 --> 00:24:43,678
Oh, please!

310
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,246
Please, please!

311
00:24:45,248 --> 00:24:47,451
No, no, no. No.

312
00:24:48,819 --> 00:24:50,320
No.

313
00:24:52,389 --> 00:24:53,722
Excuse me. Sorry.

314
00:24:53,724 --> 00:24:55,091
Oh, Cassie, no.

315
00:24:55,093 --> 00:24:56,660
No, no, no.

316
00:24:57,961 --> 00:25:00,462
No, no.

317
00:25:00,464 --> 00:25:03,600
Please, please, please.
No, Cassie.

318
00:25:10,774 --> 00:25:11,908
What?

319
00:25:41,972 --> 00:25:43,439
Cassie?

320
00:25:44,573 --> 00:25:45,875
Dad?

321
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,435
You're so big!

322
00:26:27,482 --> 00:26:28,816
<i>Yeah. We boarded</i>

323
00:26:28,818 --> 00:26:32,219
<i>that highly-suspect
warship Danvers pinged.</i>

324
00:26:32,221 --> 00:26:34,121
<i>It was an infectious
garbage scow.</i>

325
00:26:34,123 --> 00:26:35,621
<i>So, thanks
for the hot tip.</i>

326
00:26:35,623 --> 00:26:37,024
<i>Well, you were closer.</i>

327
00:26:37,026 --> 00:26:38,591
<i>Yeah. And now
we smell like garbage.</i>

328
00:26:38,593 --> 00:26:39,993
You get a reading
on those tremors?

329
00:26:39,995 --> 00:26:42,795
<i>'Twas a mild subduction
under the African plate.</i>

330
00:26:42,797 --> 00:26:45,165
Do we have a visual?
How are we handling it?

331
00:26:45,167 --> 00:26:46,666
<i>Nat.</i>

332
00:26:46,668 --> 00:26:48,768
<i>It's an earthquake
under the ocean.</i>

333
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:52,438
<i>We handle it
by not handling it.</i>

334
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,107
Carol, are we seeing you
here next month?

335
00:26:55,109 --> 00:26:56,242
<i>Not likely.</i>

336
00:26:56,244 --> 00:26:58,010
<i>What? You gonna get
another haircut?</i>

337
00:26:58,012 --> 00:26:59,412
<i>Listen, fur face.</i>

338
00:26:59,414 --> 00:27:01,380
<i>I'm covering
a lot of territory.</i>

339
00:27:01,382 --> 00:27:03,282
<i>The things that are
happening on Earth</i>

340
00:27:03,284 --> 00:27:04,951
<i>are happening
everywhere.</i>

341
00:27:04,953 --> 00:27:06,752
<i>On thousands of planets.</i>

342
00:27:06,754 --> 00:27:08,420
<i>All right, all right.
That's a good point.</i>

343
00:27:08,422 --> 00:27:09,622
<i>That's a good point.</i>

344
00:27:09,624 --> 00:27:11,893
<i>So, you might not see me
for a long time.</i>

345
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,494
All right. Uh, well...

346
00:27:15,196 --> 00:27:17,429
This channel's
always active.

347
00:27:17,431 --> 00:27:19,631
So, if anything
goes sideways...

348
00:27:19,633 --> 00:27:22,301
anyone's making trouble
where they shouldn't...

349
00:27:22,303 --> 00:27:23,501
comes through me.

350
00:27:23,503 --> 00:27:25,271
<i>Okay.</i>

351
00:27:25,273 --> 00:27:26,841
All right.

352
00:27:27,441 --> 00:27:28,709
<i>Good luck.</i>

353
00:27:37,185 --> 00:27:38,317
Where are you?

354
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:39,451
<i>Mexico.</i>

355
00:27:39,453 --> 00:27:42,288
<i>The Federales found
a room full of bodies.</i>

356
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:43,922
<i>Looks like a bunch
of cartel guys...</i>

357
00:27:43,924 --> 00:27:46,225
<i>never even had a chance
to get their guns off.</i>

358
00:27:46,227 --> 00:27:48,126
It's probably a rival gang.

359
00:27:48,128 --> 00:27:49,494
<i>Except it isn't.</i>

360
00:27:49,496 --> 00:27:52,230
<i>It's definitely Barton.</i>

361
00:27:52,232 --> 00:27:53,832
<i>What he's done here...</i>

362
00:27:53,834 --> 00:27:57,836
<i>what he's been doing
for the last few years...</i>

363
00:27:57,838 --> 00:27:59,873
<i>I mean, the scene
that he left...</i>

364
00:28:00,874 --> 00:28:01,973
<i>I gotta tell you,</i>

365
00:28:01,975 --> 00:28:04,511
<i>there's a part of me that
doesn't even wanna find him.</i>

366
00:28:09,816 --> 00:28:12,185
Will you find out
where he's going next?

367
00:28:16,123 --> 00:28:17,423
<i>Nat?</i>

368
00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:20,827
Please?

369
00:28:22,428 --> 00:28:23,763
<i>Okay.</i>

370
00:28:32,205 --> 00:28:34,538
You know, I'd offer
to cook you dinner...

371
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,209
but you seem
pretty miserable already.

372
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,946
You here
to do your laundry?

373
00:28:41,948 --> 00:28:43,616
And to see a friend.

374
00:28:44,483 --> 00:28:47,219
Clearly, your friend is fine.

375
00:28:49,822 --> 00:28:51,322
You know,
I saw a pod of whales

376
00:28:51,324 --> 00:28:52,556
when I was coming over
the bridge.

377
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:54,558
- In the Hudson?
- There's fewer ships...

378
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,893
cleaner water.

379
00:28:55,895 --> 00:28:58,062
You know, if you're
about to tell me

380
00:28:58,064 --> 00:29:00,197
to look on the bright side...

381
00:29:00,199 --> 00:29:01,567
Um...

382
00:29:02,335 --> 00:29:03,701
I'm about to hit you
in the head

383
00:29:03,703 --> 00:29:06,070
with a peanut butter sandwich.

384
00:29:06,072 --> 00:29:07,073
Hmm.

385
00:29:07,974 --> 00:29:09,239
Sorry.

386
00:29:09,241 --> 00:29:10,575
Force of habit.

387
00:29:24,589 --> 00:29:26,190
You know,
I keep telling everybody

388
00:29:26,192 --> 00:29:28,158
they should move on...

389
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:29,761
and grow.

390
00:29:30,929 --> 00:29:32,164
Some do.

391
00:29:35,533 --> 00:29:37,135
But not us.

392
00:29:37,836 --> 00:29:40,270
If I move on, who does this?

393
00:29:40,272 --> 00:29:42,574
Maybe it doesn't need
to be done.

394
00:29:46,544 --> 00:29:48,947
I used to have nothing.

395
00:29:50,081 --> 00:29:52,017
And then I got this.

396
00:29:54,152 --> 00:29:56,021
This job.

397
00:29:58,323 --> 00:30:00,125
This family.

398
00:30:05,764 --> 00:30:07,866
And I was better
because of it.

399
00:30:13,872 --> 00:30:17,708
And even though
they're gone...

400
00:30:21,479 --> 00:30:24,015
I'm still trying to be better.

401
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:29,586
I think we both
need to get a life.

402
00:30:32,022 --> 00:30:33,258
You first.

403
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:40,095
<i>Oh, hi, hi!</i>

404
00:30:40,097 --> 00:30:41,397
<i>Uh, is anyone home?</i>

405
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:43,098
<i>This is, uh, Scott Lang.</i>

406
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,301
<i>We met a few years ago
at the airport...</i>

407
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:47,969
<i>in Germany?</i>

408
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,338
<i>I was the guy that got
really big. I had a mask on.</i>

409
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,074
- <i>You wouldn't recognize me.</i>
- Is this an old message?

410
00:30:52,076 --> 00:30:55,377
<i>Ant-Man?
I know you know that.</i>

411
00:30:55,379 --> 00:30:56,577
It's the front gate.

412
00:30:56,579 --> 00:30:58,113
<i>I really need
to talk to you guys.</i>

413
00:31:04,188 --> 00:31:05,322
Scott.

414
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:07,422
Are you okay?

415
00:31:07,424 --> 00:31:08,624
Yeah.

416
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,894
Have either of you guys
ever studied quantum physics?

417
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:14,697
Only to make
conversation.

418
00:31:15,566 --> 00:31:17,566
All right, so...

419
00:31:17,568 --> 00:31:20,337
five years ago,
right before...

420
00:31:21,003 --> 00:31:22,204
Thanos...

421
00:31:22,206 --> 00:31:24,406
I was in a place called
the quantum realm.

422
00:31:24,408 --> 00:31:27,342
The quantum realm is like
its own microscopic universe.

423
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:29,578
To get in there,
you have to be incredibly small.

424
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,215
Hope. She's my, um...

425
00:31:33,283 --> 00:31:35,051
She was my...

426
00:31:36,619 --> 00:31:37,918
She was supposed
to pull me out.

427
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,720
And then Thanos happened...

428
00:31:39,722 --> 00:31:41,822
and I got stuck in there.

429
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,924
I'm sorry, that must have
been a very long five years.

430
00:31:43,926 --> 00:31:45,527
Yeah, but that's just it.

431
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:46,794
It wasn't.

432
00:31:46,796 --> 00:31:48,095
For me, it was five hours.

433
00:31:48,097 --> 00:31:49,630
See, the rules
of the quantum realm

434
00:31:49,632 --> 00:31:50,764
aren't like
they are up here.

435
00:31:50,766 --> 00:31:52,533
Everything is unpredictable.

436
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:54,034
Is that anybody's sandwich?

437
00:31:54,036 --> 00:31:55,238
I'm starving.

438
00:31:55,505 --> 00:31:56,737
Scott.

439
00:31:56,739 --> 00:31:58,174
What are you
talking about?

440
00:31:59,175 --> 00:32:00,376
So...

441
00:32:01,344 --> 00:32:03,710
what I'm saying is...

442
00:32:03,712 --> 00:32:06,380
time works differently
in the quantum realm.

443
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:08,149
The only problem is
right now

444
00:32:08,151 --> 00:32:09,749
we don't have a way
to navigate it.

445
00:32:09,751 --> 00:32:11,552
But what if we did?

446
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:12,785
I can't stop thinking
about it.

447
00:32:12,787 --> 00:32:14,854
What if we could somehow
control the chaos...

448
00:32:14,856 --> 00:32:16,290
and we could navigate it?

449
00:32:16,292 --> 00:32:17,824
What if there was a way...

450
00:32:17,826 --> 00:32:19,593
that we could enter
the quantum realm

451
00:32:19,595 --> 00:32:20,793
at a certain point in time...

452
00:32:20,795 --> 00:32:22,429
but then exit
the quantum realm

453
00:32:22,431 --> 00:32:23,696
at another point in time?

454
00:32:23,698 --> 00:32:25,765
Like...

455
00:32:25,767 --> 00:32:27,967
- Like before Thanos.
- Wait.

456
00:32:27,969 --> 00:32:29,769
Are you talking
about a time machine?

457
00:32:29,771 --> 00:32:32,705
No. No, of course not.
No, not a time machine.

458
00:32:32,707 --> 00:32:33,942
This is more like a...

459
00:32:36,044 --> 00:32:37,844
Yeah. Like a time machine.

460
00:32:37,846 --> 00:32:39,746
I know, it's crazy.
It's crazy.

461
00:32:39,748 --> 00:32:42,115
But I can't stop
thinking about it.

462
00:32:42,117 --> 00:32:43,318
There's gotta be...

463
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,485
some way...

464
00:32:45,487 --> 00:32:47,453
- It's crazy.
- Scott.

465
00:32:47,455 --> 00:32:48,821
I get emails from a raccoon...

466
00:32:48,823 --> 00:32:51,624
so nothing sounds crazy
anymore.

467
00:32:51,626 --> 00:32:53,895
So, who do we talk to
about this?

468
00:33:12,113 --> 00:33:13,181
Chow time!

469
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,784
Maguna.

470
00:33:20,821 --> 00:33:22,324
Morgan H. Stark,
you want some lunch?

471
00:33:23,358 --> 00:33:24,424
<i>Define "lunch"</i>

472
00:33:24,426 --> 00:33:25,826
- <i>or be disintegrated.</i>
- Okay.

473
00:33:26,927 --> 00:33:28,628
You should not be
wearing that, okay?

474
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,195
That is part of a special
anniversary gift

475
00:33:30,197 --> 00:33:31,265
I'm making for Mom.

476
00:33:34,868 --> 00:33:37,470
There you go.
You thinking about lunch?

477
00:33:37,472 --> 00:33:39,738
I can give you a handful of
crickets on a bed of lettuce.

478
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,641
- No.
- That's what you want.

479
00:33:41,643 --> 00:33:43,875
How did you find this?

480
00:33:43,877 --> 00:33:45,877
- Garage.
- Really?

481
00:33:45,879 --> 00:33:48,082
- Were you looking for it?
- No.

482
00:33:48,782 --> 00:33:50,816
- I found it, though.
- Hmm.

483
00:33:50,818 --> 00:33:52,751
You like going in
the garage, huh?

484
00:33:52,753 --> 00:33:54,553
So does Daddy.

485
00:33:54,555 --> 00:33:57,824
It's fine, actually.
Mom never wears anything I buy her.

486
00:34:00,394 --> 00:34:01,794
So, I'm gonna...

487
00:34:19,012 --> 00:34:21,713
No. We know
what it sounds like.

488
00:34:21,715 --> 00:34:22,813
Tony, after everything
you've seen,

489
00:34:22,815 --> 00:34:24,115
is anything really
impossible?

490
00:34:24,117 --> 00:34:26,183
Quantum fluctuation messes
with the Planck scale...

491
00:34:26,185 --> 00:34:27,985
which then triggers
the Deutsch Proposition.

492
00:34:27,987 --> 00:34:29,353
Can we agree on that?

493
00:34:29,355 --> 00:34:30,522
Thank you.

494
00:34:30,524 --> 00:34:32,923
In layman's terms,
it means you're not coming home.

495
00:34:32,925 --> 00:34:34,258
- I did.
- No.

496
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,227
You accidentally survived.

497
00:34:36,229 --> 00:34:38,496
It's a billion-to-one
cosmic fluke.

498
00:34:38,498 --> 00:34:41,968
And now you wanna pull a...
What do you call it?

499
00:34:43,803 --> 00:34:45,202
A time heist?

500
00:34:45,204 --> 00:34:47,571
Yeah, a time heist.
Of course.

501
00:34:47,573 --> 00:34:48,873
Why didn't we think
of this before?

502
00:34:48,875 --> 00:34:51,509
Oh, because it's laughable.
Because it's a pipe dream.

503
00:34:51,511 --> 00:34:53,711
The stones are in the past.

504
00:34:53,713 --> 00:34:55,112
We could go back,
we could get them.

505
00:34:55,114 --> 00:34:57,481
We can snap our own fingers.
We can bring everybody back.

506
00:34:57,483 --> 00:34:59,750
Or screw it up worse than
he already has, right?

507
00:34:59,752 --> 00:35:01,218
I don't believe we would.

508
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:04,755
Gotta say it. I sometimes
miss that giddy optimism.

509
00:35:04,757 --> 00:35:06,657
However, high hopes
won't help...

510
00:35:06,659 --> 00:35:08,693
if there's no logical,
tangible way

511
00:35:08,695 --> 00:35:12,196
for me to safely execute
said time heist.

512
00:35:12,198 --> 00:35:14,164
I believe
the most likely outcome

513
00:35:14,166 --> 00:35:15,499
will be our
collective demise.

514
00:35:15,501 --> 00:35:18,234
Not if we strictly follow
the rules of time travel.

515
00:35:18,236 --> 00:35:21,037
All right? It means no
talking to our past selves...

516
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:22,807
no betting
on sporting events.

517
00:35:22,809 --> 00:35:24,610
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Scott.

518
00:35:25,545 --> 00:35:26,910
Are you seriously
telling me

519
00:35:26,912 --> 00:35:28,878
that your plan
to save the universe...

520
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,616
is based on
<i>Back to the Future?</i>

521
00:35:31,718 --> 00:35:33,651
- Is it?
- No.

522
00:35:33,653 --> 00:35:34,752
Good. You had me
worried there.

523
00:35:34,754 --> 00:35:35,919
'Cause that would be
horseshit.

524
00:35:35,921 --> 00:35:38,488
That's not how
quantum physics works.

525
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:39,624
Tony.

526
00:35:41,593 --> 00:35:43,693
We have to take a stand.

527
00:35:43,695 --> 00:35:45,597
We did stand.
And yet, here we are.

528
00:35:47,866 --> 00:35:49,699
I know you got
a lot on the line.

529
00:35:49,701 --> 00:35:52,268
You got a wife, a daughter.

530
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:55,004
But I lost someone
very important to me.

531
00:35:55,006 --> 00:35:56,606
A lotta people did.

532
00:35:56,608 --> 00:35:59,942
And now, now we have a chance
to bring her back...

533
00:35:59,944 --> 00:36:01,144
to bring everyone back,

534
00:36:01,146 --> 00:36:02,812
and you're telling me
that you won't even...

535
00:36:02,814 --> 00:36:04,649
That's right, Scott.
I won't even.

536
00:36:06,184 --> 00:36:07,751
I can't.

537
00:36:09,621 --> 00:36:12,355
Mommy told me
to come and save you.

538
00:36:12,357 --> 00:36:15,290
Good job. I'm saved.

539
00:36:15,292 --> 00:36:17,594
I wish you were coming here
to ask me something else.

540
00:36:17,596 --> 00:36:18,595
Anything else.

541
00:36:18,597 --> 00:36:20,663
I'm honestly happy
to see you guys, I just...

542
00:36:20,665 --> 00:36:22,030
Oh, look, the table's
set for six.

543
00:36:22,032 --> 00:36:23,767
Tony. I get it.

544
00:36:23,769 --> 00:36:26,203
And I'm happy for you.
I really am.

545
00:36:26,838 --> 00:36:29,004
But this is a second chance.

546
00:36:29,006 --> 00:36:31,674
I got my second chance
right here, Cap.

547
00:36:31,676 --> 00:36:33,310
Can't roll the dice on it.

548
00:36:35,179 --> 00:36:37,314
If you don't talk shop,
you can stay for lunch.

549
00:36:40,518 --> 00:36:42,418
Well, he's scared.

550
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,419
He's not wrong.

551
00:36:43,421 --> 00:36:45,721
Yeah, but, I mean,
what are we gonna do?

552
00:36:45,723 --> 00:36:47,163
We need him.
What, are we gonna stop?

553
00:36:47,893 --> 00:36:50,094
No, I wanna do it right.

554
00:36:53,063 --> 00:36:54,998
We're gonna need
a really big brain.

555
00:36:55,866 --> 00:36:57,566
Bigger than his?

556
00:36:57,568 --> 00:36:59,501
Come on, I feel like I'm
the only one eating here.

557
00:36:59,503 --> 00:37:00,602
Try some of that.

558
00:37:00,604 --> 00:37:02,003
Have some eggs.

559
00:37:02,005 --> 00:37:03,372
I'm so confused.

560
00:37:03,374 --> 00:37:05,207
These are confusing times.

561
00:37:05,209 --> 00:37:07,276
Right, no, no.
That's not what I meant.

562
00:37:07,278 --> 00:37:10,079
Nah, I get it.
I'm kidding!

563
00:37:10,548 --> 00:37:12,514
I know, it's crazy.

564
00:37:12,516 --> 00:37:13,816
I'm wearing shirts now.

565
00:37:13,818 --> 00:37:17,051
Yeah. What? How? Why?

566
00:37:17,053 --> 00:37:20,021
Five years ago,
we got our asses beat.

567
00:37:20,023 --> 00:37:21,857
Except it was worse
for me...

568
00:37:21,859 --> 00:37:23,157
'cause I lost twice.

569
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:25,195
First, Hulk lost,
then Banner lost...

570
00:37:25,896 --> 00:37:27,228
and then, we all lost.

571
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:28,764
No one blamed you, Bruce.

572
00:37:28,766 --> 00:37:30,266
I did.

573
00:37:31,869 --> 00:37:33,134
For years, I've been
treating the Hulk

574
00:37:33,136 --> 00:37:34,502
like he's some kind
of disease...

575
00:37:34,504 --> 00:37:36,471
something to get rid of.

576
00:37:36,473 --> 00:37:39,875
But then, I start looking
at him as the cure.

577
00:37:39,877 --> 00:37:42,109
Eighteen months
in the gamma lab.

578
00:37:42,111 --> 00:37:44,912
I put the brains
and the brawn together...

579
00:37:44,914 --> 00:37:46,316
and now, look at me.

580
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:49,217
Best of both worlds.

581
00:37:49,219 --> 00:37:50,818
- Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
- Yes.

582
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,620
Can we get a photo?

583
00:37:52,622 --> 00:37:54,755
100%, little person.

584
00:37:54,757 --> 00:37:57,358
Come on, step on up.
Do you mind?

585
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,427
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Thanks.

586
00:37:59,429 --> 00:38:01,027
Say "green."

587
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:03,498
- Green.
- Green.

588
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,632
Did you get that?

589
00:38:04,634 --> 00:38:06,467
That's a good one.

590
00:38:06,469 --> 00:38:09,071
Did you want to grab one
with me? I'm Ant-Man.

591
00:38:12,407 --> 00:38:14,407
They're Hulk fans.
They don't know Ant-Man.

592
00:38:14,409 --> 00:38:15,643
- Nobody does.
- No, he wants you to take

593
00:38:15,645 --> 00:38:17,645
- a picture with him.
- I don't want a picture.

594
00:38:17,647 --> 00:38:18,579
Stranger danger.

595
00:38:18,581 --> 00:38:20,280
Yeah, look, he's even
saying no, he doesn't.

596
00:38:20,282 --> 00:38:21,548
I get it.
I don't want it, either.

597
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,717
But come on. The kid...

598
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:24,184
I don't want a picture
with them.

599
00:38:24,186 --> 00:38:25,385
- He's gonna feel bad.
- Sorry.

600
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:26,586
They're happy to do it.
They said they'll do it.

601
00:38:26,588 --> 00:38:28,288
- I don't want to do it.
- We can do it.

602
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:30,590
- No, you feel bad.
- Take the goddamn phone.

603
00:38:30,592 --> 00:38:31,826
Okay.

604
00:38:31,828 --> 00:38:33,226
Thank you, Mr. Hulk.

605
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:34,996
No, it was great,
kids. Thank you very much.

606
00:38:34,998 --> 00:38:36,630
Hulk out!

607
00:38:36,632 --> 00:38:37,666
Bruce.

608
00:38:38,001 --> 00:38:39,266
Dab.

609
00:38:39,268 --> 00:38:41,468
- Bruce.
- Listen to your mom.

610
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:42,602
She knows better.

611
00:38:42,604 --> 00:38:44,471
About what we were saying.

612
00:38:44,473 --> 00:38:45,641
Right.

613
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:50,345
The whole time travel
do-over?

614
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:55,749
Eh, guys, it's outside
of my area of expertise.

615
00:38:55,751 --> 00:38:57,784
Well, you pulled this off.

616
00:38:57,786 --> 00:39:01,823
I remember a time when that
seemed pretty impossible, too.

617
00:39:35,057 --> 00:39:36,555
I've got a mild inspiration.

618
00:39:36,557 --> 00:39:38,058
I'd like to see
if it checks out.

619
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:40,192
So, I'd like to run
one last sim

620
00:39:40,194 --> 00:39:41,994
before we pack it in
for the night.

621
00:39:41,996 --> 00:39:45,064
This time, in the shape
of a Mobius strip,

622
00:39:45,066 --> 00:39:46,632
inverted, please.

623
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:47,702
<i>Processing.</i>

624
00:39:50,905 --> 00:39:53,806
Right, give me the eigenvalue
of that particle...

625
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,741
factoring in spectral decomp.

626
00:39:55,743 --> 00:39:58,744
- That'll take a second.
<i>- Just a moment.</i>

627
00:39:58,746 --> 00:40:01,849
And don't worry if it doesn't pan out.
I'm just kinda...

628
00:40:03,283 --> 00:40:04,917
<i>Model rendered.</i>

629
00:40:16,731 --> 00:40:17,997
Shit!

630
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:19,399
Shit!

631
00:40:23,236 --> 00:40:25,136
What are you
doing up, little miss?

632
00:40:25,138 --> 00:40:27,039
- Shit.
- Nope. We don't say that.

633
00:40:27,041 --> 00:40:28,339
Only Mommy says that word.

634
00:40:28,341 --> 00:40:30,009
She coined it.
It belongs to her.

635
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:31,242
Why are you up?

636
00:40:31,244 --> 00:40:32,744
'Cause I've got some
important shit going on here!

637
00:40:32,746 --> 00:40:34,013
Why do you think?

638
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:35,513
No, I got something
on my mind.

639
00:40:35,515 --> 00:40:37,116
I got something on my mind.

640
00:40:37,118 --> 00:40:38,752
Was it juice pops?

641
00:40:40,186 --> 00:40:41,554
Sure was.

642
00:40:42,889 --> 00:40:44,822
That's extortion.
That's a word.

643
00:40:44,824 --> 00:40:46,090
What kind you want?

644
00:40:46,092 --> 00:40:47,225
Great minds think alike.

645
00:40:47,227 --> 00:40:49,295
Juice pops exactly...

646
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:52,532
was on my mind.

647
00:40:53,867 --> 00:40:55,167
You done? Yeah?

648
00:40:55,602 --> 00:40:56,770
Now you are.

649
00:40:57,269 --> 00:40:58,571
Here. Wipe.

650
00:41:01,141 --> 00:41:04,008
Good. That face
goes there.

651
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:05,543
Tell me a story.

652
00:41:05,545 --> 00:41:06,944
A story.

653
00:41:06,946 --> 00:41:09,747
Once upon a time, Maguna went to bed.
The end.

654
00:41:09,749 --> 00:41:11,181
That is a horrible story.

655
00:41:11,183 --> 00:41:13,185
Come on, that's
your favorite story.

656
00:41:13,753 --> 00:41:14,888
Love you tons.

657
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:18,757
I love you 3,000.

658
00:41:19,959 --> 00:41:20,960
Wow.

659
00:41:28,233 --> 00:41:31,336
3,000.
That's crazy.

660
00:41:32,304 --> 00:41:34,339
Go to bed or I'll sell
all your toys.

661
00:41:35,307 --> 00:41:36,907
Night night.

662
00:41:36,909 --> 00:41:38,475
Not that it's a competition...

663
00:41:38,477 --> 00:41:40,744
but she loves me 3,000.

664
00:41:40,746 --> 00:41:41,745
Does she, now?

665
00:41:41,747 --> 00:41:45,048
You were somewhere
in the low 6 to 900 range.

666
00:41:51,023 --> 00:41:53,123
Whatcha reading?

667
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:54,825
Just a book on composting.

668
00:41:54,827 --> 00:41:56,895
What's new with composting?

669
00:41:58,262 --> 00:42:00,498
- Interesting science...
- I figured it out.

670
00:42:01,567 --> 00:42:02,568
By the way.

671
00:42:03,267 --> 00:42:04,500
And, you know,

672
00:42:04,502 --> 00:42:06,903
just so we're talking
about the same thing...

673
00:42:06,905 --> 00:42:08,473
Time travel.

674
00:42:08,874 --> 00:42:09,875
What?

675
00:42:14,046 --> 00:42:15,246
Wow.

676
00:42:19,118 --> 00:42:20,752
That's amazing...

677
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:22,953
and terrifying.

678
00:42:22,955 --> 00:42:24,522
That's right.

679
00:42:31,763 --> 00:42:33,662
We got really lucky.

680
00:42:33,664 --> 00:42:34,797
Yeah.

681
00:42:34,799 --> 00:42:36,031
I know.

682
00:42:36,033 --> 00:42:37,299
A lot of people didn't.

683
00:42:37,301 --> 00:42:38,970
Nope. And I can't
help everybody.

684
00:42:40,571 --> 00:42:42,171
Sorta seems like you can.

685
00:42:42,173 --> 00:42:43,875
Not if I stop.

686
00:42:44,809 --> 00:42:47,912
I can put a pin in it
right now and stop.

687
00:42:48,746 --> 00:42:50,311
Tony...

688
00:42:50,313 --> 00:42:51,881
trying to get you to stop...

689
00:42:51,883 --> 00:42:54,786
has been one of the few
failures of my entire life.

690
00:42:59,023 --> 00:43:00,758
Something tells me...

691
00:43:01,993 --> 00:43:02,925
I should put it
in a lockbox

692
00:43:02,927 --> 00:43:04,729
and drop it to the bottom
of the lake...

693
00:43:05,897 --> 00:43:07,064
and go to bed.

694
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:15,605
But would you be able to rest?

695
00:43:19,977 --> 00:43:23,778
Okay, here we go.
Time travel test number one.

696
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,916
Scott, fire up...

697
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:27,984
the, uh, van thing.

698
00:43:30,221 --> 00:43:31,386
Breakers are set.

699
00:43:31,388 --> 00:43:33,388
Emergency generators
are on standby.

700
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:35,023
Good, because
if we blow the grid,

701
00:43:35,025 --> 00:43:38,459
I don't want to lose, uh,
Tiny here in the 1950s.

702
00:43:38,461 --> 00:43:41,563
- Excuse me?
- He's kidding.

703
00:43:41,565 --> 00:43:43,531
You can't say things
like that.

704
00:43:43,533 --> 00:43:45,468
It was a bad joke.

705
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:48,703
You were kidding, right?

706
00:43:48,705 --> 00:43:51,606
I have no idea.
We're talking about time travel here.

707
00:43:51,608 --> 00:43:54,142
Either it's all a joke,
or none of it is.

708
00:43:54,144 --> 00:43:56,010
We're good!

709
00:43:56,012 --> 00:43:57,779
Get your helmet on.

710
00:43:57,781 --> 00:43:59,747
Scott, I'm gonna
send you back a week...

711
00:43:59,749 --> 00:44:01,515
let you walk around
for an hour,

712
00:44:01,517 --> 00:44:03,251
then bring you back
in 10 seconds.

713
00:44:03,253 --> 00:44:04,986
Make sense?

714
00:44:04,988 --> 00:44:06,321
Perfectly not confusing.

715
00:44:06,323 --> 00:44:08,490
Good luck, Scott.
You got this.

716
00:44:09,725 --> 00:44:12,963
You're right.
I do, Captain America.

717
00:44:15,098 --> 00:44:16,496
On a count of three...

718
00:44:16,498 --> 00:44:20,467
Three, two, one.

719
00:44:23,806 --> 00:44:25,906
Uh... Guys?

720
00:44:25,908 --> 00:44:27,441
This doesn't feel right.

721
00:44:27,443 --> 00:44:28,542
What is this?

722
00:44:28,544 --> 00:44:29,576
- What's going on?
- Who is that?

723
00:44:29,578 --> 00:44:30,844
- Hold on.
- Is that Scott?

724
00:44:30,846 --> 00:44:31,847
Yes, it's Scott.

725
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:37,317
- What's going on, Bruce?
- Oh, my back!

726
00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:38,385
- What is this?
- Hold on a second.

727
00:44:38,387 --> 00:44:39,553
Could I get
a little space here?

728
00:44:39,555 --> 00:44:40,821
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Can you bring him back?

729
00:44:40,823 --> 00:44:41,922
I'm working on it.

730
00:44:48,898 --> 00:44:49,830
It's a baby.

731
00:44:49,832 --> 00:44:51,632
- It's Scott.
- As a baby.

732
00:44:51,634 --> 00:44:53,033
- He'll grow.
- Bring Scott back.

733
00:44:53,035 --> 00:44:54,868
When I say kill the power,
kill the power.

734
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:56,071
Oh, my God.

735
00:44:56,839 --> 00:44:58,140
And... kill it!

736
00:45:02,477 --> 00:45:04,378
Somebody peed my pants.

737
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:05,544
Oh, thank God.

738
00:45:05,546 --> 00:45:08,918
But I don't know
if it was baby me or old me.

739
00:45:12,187 --> 00:45:14,156
Or just me me.

740
00:45:14,489 --> 00:45:15,857
Time travel!

741
00:45:19,661 --> 00:45:20,662
What?

742
00:45:22,197 --> 00:45:24,599
I see this as an absolute win.

743
00:46:10,144 --> 00:46:11,509
Why the long face?

744
00:46:11,511 --> 00:46:14,512
Let me guess,
he turned into a baby.

745
00:46:14,514 --> 00:46:16,648
Among other things, yeah.
What are you doing here?

746
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:18,817
It's the EPR Paradox.

747
00:46:18,819 --> 00:46:20,085
Instead of pushing Lang
through time,

748
00:46:20,087 --> 00:46:21,186
you might've wound up...

749
00:46:21,188 --> 00:46:22,654
pushing time through Lang.

750
00:46:22,656 --> 00:46:23,822
It's tricky, dangerous.

751
00:46:23,824 --> 00:46:25,523
Somebody could have
cautioned you against it.

752
00:46:25,525 --> 00:46:26,825
You did.

753
00:46:26,827 --> 00:46:28,126
Oh, did I?

754
00:46:28,128 --> 00:46:29,863
Well, thank God
I'm here.

755
00:46:30,497 --> 00:46:32,199
Regardless, I fixed it.

756
00:46:33,066 --> 00:46:35,702
A fully functioning
time-space GPS.

757
00:46:37,571 --> 00:46:38,972
I just want peace.

758
00:46:40,474 --> 00:46:43,243
Turns out resentment
is corrosive, and I hate it.

759
00:46:44,144 --> 00:46:45,645
Me, too.

760
00:46:46,645 --> 00:46:48,279
We got a shot
at getting these stones,

761
00:46:48,281 --> 00:46:50,348
but I gotta tell you
my priorities.

762
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:52,750
Bring back what we lost,
I hope, yes.

763
00:46:52,752 --> 00:46:55,822
Keep what I found,
I have to, at all costs.

764
00:46:56,822 --> 00:46:59,623
And maybe not die trying.

765
00:46:59,625 --> 00:47:00,860
Would be nice.

766
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:04,297
Sounds like a deal.

767
00:47:27,787 --> 00:47:29,119
Tony, I don't know.

768
00:47:29,121 --> 00:47:30,754
Why?

769
00:47:30,756 --> 00:47:32,723
He made it for you.

770
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:34,591
Plus, honestly,
I have to get it out of the garage

771
00:47:34,593 --> 00:47:36,595
before Morgan
takes it sledding.

772
00:47:42,034 --> 00:47:43,135
Thank you, Tony.

773
00:47:43,936 --> 00:47:46,136
Will you keep that
a little quiet?

774
00:47:46,138 --> 00:47:47,840
Didn't bring one
for the whole team.

775
00:47:49,442 --> 00:47:52,809
We are getting
the whole team, yeah?

776
00:47:52,811 --> 00:47:54,813
We're working
on that right now.

777
00:48:12,697 --> 00:48:14,364
Hey, Humie.

778
00:48:14,366 --> 00:48:16,467
Where's Big Green?

779
00:48:16,469 --> 00:48:18,703
The kitchen, I think.

780
00:48:19,704 --> 00:48:21,072
That's awesome.

781
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,441
Rhodey,
careful on re-entry.

782
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:26,211
There's an idiot
in the landing zone.

783
00:48:27,345 --> 00:48:28,911
Oh, God.

784
00:48:28,913 --> 00:48:31,149
<i>What's up,
Regular-Sized Man?</i>

785
00:49:21,832 --> 00:49:24,466
Kind of a step down
from the golden palaces

786
00:49:24,468 --> 00:49:26,168
and the magic hammers
and whatnot.

787
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:27,802
Hey, have a little
compassion, pal.

788
00:49:27,804 --> 00:49:29,905
First, they lost Asgard,
then half their people.

789
00:49:29,907 --> 00:49:31,673
They're probably just happy
to have a home.

790
00:49:31,675 --> 00:49:33,508
You shouldn't have come.

791
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:35,179
Ah!

792
00:49:35,512 --> 00:49:36,645
Valkyrie!

793
00:49:36,647 --> 00:49:39,347
Great to see you,
angry girl!

794
00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:41,919
I think I liked you better
either of the other ways.

795
00:49:42,586 --> 00:49:43,652
This is Rocket.

796
00:49:43,654 --> 00:49:44,955
How ya doing?

797
00:49:47,291 --> 00:49:48,557
He won't see you.

798
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:49,723
It's that bad, huh?

799
00:49:49,725 --> 00:49:51,126
We only see him
once a month

800
00:49:51,128 --> 00:49:54,431
when he comes
in for "supplies."

801
00:49:55,499 --> 00:49:56,931
It's that bad.

802
00:49:56,933 --> 00:49:57,934
Yeah.

803
00:50:10,347 --> 00:50:11,446
What the...?

804
00:50:13,783 --> 00:50:16,317
Whew! Something died in here!

805
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:20,187
Hello? Thor!

806
00:50:20,189 --> 00:50:22,723
Are you here
about the cable?

807
00:50:22,725 --> 00:50:25,292
The Cinemax went out
two weeks ago...

808
00:50:25,294 --> 00:50:28,264
and the sports are all
kinda fuzzy and whatnot.

809
00:50:28,864 --> 00:50:30,066
Thor?

810
00:50:37,807 --> 00:50:40,975
Boys! Oh, my God!

811
00:50:40,977 --> 00:50:43,980
Oh, my God,
it's so good to see you!

812
00:50:45,147 --> 00:50:46,580
Come here,
cuddly little rascal.

813
00:50:46,582 --> 00:50:49,416
Yeah, no, I'm good. I'm good.

814
00:50:49,418 --> 00:50:50,850
That's not necessary.

815
00:50:50,852 --> 00:50:53,721
Hulk, you know my friends
Miek and Korg, right?

816
00:50:53,723 --> 00:50:54,954
- Hey, boys!
- Hey, guys.

817
00:50:54,956 --> 00:50:56,490
Long time no see.

818
00:50:56,492 --> 00:50:57,558
Beer's in the bucket.

819
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:58,858
Feel free to log on
to the Wi-Fi.

820
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:00,795
No password, obviously.

821
00:51:01,664 --> 00:51:03,196
Thor, he's back.

822
00:51:03,198 --> 00:51:06,134
That kid on the TV just
called me a dickhead again.

823
00:51:06,569 --> 00:51:07,735
Noobmaster.

824
00:51:07,737 --> 00:51:10,437
Yeah, NoobMaster69
called me a dickhead.

825
00:51:10,439 --> 00:51:12,506
I am sick of this.

826
00:51:12,508 --> 00:51:14,107
Noobmaster, hey,
it's Thor again.

827
00:51:14,109 --> 00:51:15,475
You know,
the God of Thunder.

828
00:51:15,477 --> 00:51:17,844
Listen, bud, if you don't log
off this game immediately...

829
00:51:17,846 --> 00:51:19,345
I am gonna fly over
to your house,

830
00:51:19,347 --> 00:51:21,080
come down to that basement
you're hiding in...

831
00:51:21,082 --> 00:51:24,284
rip off your arms,
and shove them up your butt!

832
00:51:24,286 --> 00:51:25,218
Oh, that's right, yes!

833
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:27,322
Go cry to your father,
you little weasel.

834
00:51:27,889 --> 00:51:28,988
Thank you, Thor.

835
00:51:28,990 --> 00:51:30,623
Let me know if he
bothers you again, okay?

836
00:51:30,625 --> 00:51:32,458
Thank you very much.
I will.

837
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:34,160
So, you guys want a drink?
What are we drinking?

838
00:51:34,162 --> 00:51:37,163
I've got beer, tequila,
all sorts of things.

839
00:51:39,601 --> 00:51:41,067
Buddy.

840
00:51:41,069 --> 00:51:43,770
- You all right?
- Yes, I'm fine. Why?

841
00:51:43,772 --> 00:51:45,138
Why, don't I look all right?

842
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,739
You look like
melted ice cream.

843
00:51:48,476 --> 00:51:50,876
So, what's up?
You just here for a hang, or what?

844
00:51:50,878 --> 00:51:53,045
- We need your help.
- Mm.

845
00:51:53,047 --> 00:51:55,615
There might be a chance
we could fix everything.

846
00:51:55,617 --> 00:51:57,015
What, like the cable?

847
00:51:57,017 --> 00:51:59,519
'Cause that's been
driving me bananas for weeks.

848
00:51:59,521 --> 00:52:00,522
Like Thanos.

849
00:52:19,674 --> 00:52:23,175
Don't say that name.

850
00:52:23,177 --> 00:52:26,413
Um, yeah, we don't actually
say that name in here.

851
00:52:31,085 --> 00:52:33,187
Please take
your hand off me.

852
00:52:36,523 --> 00:52:39,560
Now, I know that guy...

853
00:52:40,494 --> 00:52:41,727
might scare you.

854
00:52:41,729 --> 00:52:43,161
Why would I be...?

855
00:52:43,163 --> 00:52:46,431
Why would I be scared
of that guy?

856
00:52:46,433 --> 00:52:48,567
I'm the one who killed
that guy, remember?

857
00:52:48,569 --> 00:52:49,768
Hmm.

858
00:52:49,770 --> 00:52:51,871
Anyone else here
kill that guy?

859
00:52:55,208 --> 00:52:56,275
Nope.

860
00:52:56,710 --> 00:52:57,910
Didn't think so.

861
00:52:58,779 --> 00:53:00,712
Korg, why don't you,
uh, tell everybody

862
00:53:00,714 --> 00:53:03,047
who chopped
Thanos' big head off?

863
00:53:03,049 --> 00:53:04,783
Um, Stormbreaker?

864
00:53:04,785 --> 00:53:06,487
Who was swinging
Stormbreaker?

865
00:53:10,356 --> 00:53:12,858
I get it. You're in
a rough spot, okay?

866
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:13,991
I've been there myself.

867
00:53:13,993 --> 00:53:16,560
And you want to know
who helped me out of it?

868
00:53:16,562 --> 00:53:19,397
Was it Natasha?

869
00:53:19,399 --> 00:53:21,432
It was you.

870
00:53:21,434 --> 00:53:23,403
You helped me.

871
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:26,139
So, why don't you ask...

872
00:53:27,006 --> 00:53:29,607
the Asgardians down there...

873
00:53:29,609 --> 00:53:31,377
how much my help is worth?

874
00:53:36,915 --> 00:53:38,915
The ones that are left,
anyway.

875
00:53:38,917 --> 00:53:40,651
I think we could
bring them back.

876
00:53:40,653 --> 00:53:42,522
Stop.

877
00:53:43,623 --> 00:53:45,322
Stop, okay?

878
00:53:45,324 --> 00:53:46,724
I know you think I'm down here

879
00:53:46,726 --> 00:53:48,359
wallowing in my own
self-pity...

880
00:53:48,361 --> 00:53:51,127
waiting to be rescued
and saved...

881
00:53:51,129 --> 00:53:53,531
but I'm fine, okay.
We're fine, aren't we?

882
00:53:53,533 --> 00:53:54,832
Oh, we're
good here, mate.

883
00:53:54,834 --> 00:53:57,133
So, whatever it is that you're
offering, we're not into it.

884
00:53:57,135 --> 00:53:58,869
Don't care.
Couldn't care less.

885
00:53:58,871 --> 00:54:00,138
Goodbye.

886
00:54:03,241 --> 00:54:05,210
We need you, pal.

887
00:54:14,553 --> 00:54:16,555
There's beer on the ship.

888
00:54:20,592 --> 00:54:22,294
What kind?

889
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:11,568
What I
want you can't give me.

890
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:36,626
You shouldn't be here.

891
00:56:39,194 --> 00:56:41,196
Neither should you.

892
00:56:47,003 --> 00:56:48,571
I've got a job to do.

893
00:56:50,039 --> 00:56:51,741
Is that what
you're calling this?

894
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:53,874
Killing all these people

895
00:56:53,876 --> 00:56:55,344
isn't gonna bring
your family back.

896
00:57:01,017 --> 00:57:02,284
We found something.

897
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:06,154
A chance, maybe.

898
00:57:08,024 --> 00:57:10,592
Don't.

899
00:57:11,526 --> 00:57:12,894
Don't what?

900
00:57:15,931 --> 00:57:17,499
Don't give me hope.

901
00:57:20,569 --> 00:57:23,338
I'm sorry I couldn't
give it to you sooner.

902
00:57:44,793 --> 00:57:46,492
You're drifting left.

903
00:57:46,494 --> 00:57:48,462
One side there, Lebowski.

904
00:57:51,432 --> 00:57:52,999
Ratchet, how's it going?

905
00:57:53,001 --> 00:57:54,299
It's Rocket.

906
00:57:54,301 --> 00:57:56,870
Take it easy. You're only
a genius on Earth, pal.

907
00:58:01,509 --> 00:58:03,377
Time travel suit,
not bad.

908
00:58:04,545 --> 00:58:06,211
Hey, hey, hey!
Easy! Easy!

909
00:58:06,213 --> 00:58:07,346
I'm being very careful.

910
00:58:07,348 --> 00:58:08,948
No, you're being very Hulky.

911
00:58:08,950 --> 00:58:10,083
I'm being careful.

912
00:58:10,085 --> 00:58:11,517
These are Pym Particles,
all right?

913
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:12,986
And ever since
Hank Pym got snapped

914
00:58:12,988 --> 00:58:14,253
out of existence,
this is it.

915
00:58:14,255 --> 00:58:16,188
This is what we have.
We're not making any more.

916
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:18,390
- Scott, calm down.
- Sorry.

917
00:58:18,392 --> 00:58:21,694
We've got enough for one
round-trip each. That's it.

918
00:58:21,696 --> 00:58:22,730
No do-overs.

919
00:58:23,764 --> 00:58:25,232
Plus two test runs.

920
00:58:29,036 --> 00:58:30,135
One test run.

921
00:58:31,304 --> 00:58:33,105
All right.
I'm not ready for this.

922
00:58:33,107 --> 00:58:34,542
I'm game.

923
00:58:36,711 --> 00:58:39,011
I'll do it.

924
00:58:39,013 --> 00:58:40,211
Clint,
now you're gonna feel

925
00:58:40,213 --> 00:58:41,880
a little discombobulated
from the chronoshift.

926
00:58:41,882 --> 00:58:42,948
Don't worry about that.

927
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:44,183
Wait a second.
Let me ask you something.

928
00:58:44,185 --> 00:58:45,818
If we can do this,
you know...

929
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:48,620
go back in time, why don't
we just find baby Thanos?

930
00:58:48,622 --> 00:58:49,757
You know, and...

931
00:58:53,226 --> 00:58:54,893
First of all,
that's horrible.

932
00:58:54,895 --> 00:58:55,794
It's Thanos.

933
00:58:55,796 --> 00:58:58,163
And secondly,
time doesn't work that way.

934
00:58:58,165 --> 00:59:00,431
Changing the past
doesn't change the future.

935
00:59:00,433 --> 00:59:02,000
Look, we go back,
we get the stones

936
00:59:02,002 --> 00:59:03,334
before Thanos gets them...

937
00:59:03,336 --> 00:59:06,270
Thanos doesn't have
the stones. Problem solved.

938
00:59:06,272 --> 00:59:08,207
- Bingo.
- That's not how it works.

939
00:59:08,209 --> 00:59:09,273
Well, that's what
I heard.

940
00:59:09,275 --> 00:59:10,508
Wait, but who?
Who told you that?

941
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:12,477
<i>Star Trek,
Terminator, Timecop...</i>

942
00:59:12,479 --> 00:59:14,278
<i>- Time After Time.
- Quantum Leap.</i>

943
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:15,379
<i>Wrinkle in Time,
Somewhere in Time.</i>

944
00:59:15,381 --> 00:59:16,447
<i>Hot Tub Time Machine.</i>

945
00:59:16,449 --> 00:59:17,548
<i>Hot Tub Time Machine.</i>

946
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:18,883
<i>Bill and Ted's
Excellent Adventure.</i>

947
00:59:18,885 --> 00:59:21,285
Basically, any movie
that deals with time travel.

948
00:59:21,287 --> 00:59:23,287
<i>Die Hard.</i>
No, that's not one.

949
00:59:23,289 --> 00:59:24,455
This is known.

950
00:59:24,457 --> 00:59:25,890
I don't know why
everyone believes that,

951
00:59:25,892 --> 00:59:26,824
but that isn't true.

952
00:59:26,826 --> 00:59:29,127
Think about it.
If you travel to the past...

953
00:59:29,129 --> 00:59:31,529
that past becomes
your future...

954
00:59:31,531 --> 00:59:34,632
and your former present
becomes the past...

955
00:59:34,634 --> 00:59:37,668
which can't now be changed
by your new future.

956
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:39,302
Exactly.

957
00:59:39,304 --> 00:59:42,407
So <i>Back to the Future</i>
is a bunch of bullshit?

958
00:59:46,146 --> 00:59:48,212
All right, Clint.

959
00:59:48,214 --> 00:59:51,581
We're going in three, two...

960
00:59:51,583 --> 00:59:52,584
one.

961
01:01:04,889 --> 01:01:06,289
Cooper?

962
01:01:06,291 --> 01:01:07,990
Where are my headphones?

963
01:01:07,992 --> 01:01:09,124
Lila?

964
01:01:09,126 --> 01:01:11,228
- I never had them.
- Lila?

965
01:01:12,297 --> 01:01:13,998
Yeah,
you had them yesterday!

966
01:01:14,465 --> 01:01:15,900
Lila! Lila!

967
01:01:21,305 --> 01:01:22,506
Yeah, Dad?

968
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:27,444
Dad?

969
01:01:29,847 --> 01:01:31,113
Lila!

970
01:01:37,021 --> 01:01:39,420
Hey. Hey, look at me.

971
01:01:39,422 --> 01:01:41,290
You okay?

972
01:01:41,292 --> 01:01:43,526
Yeah. Yeah.

973
01:01:45,263 --> 01:01:46,596
It worked.

974
01:01:48,199 --> 01:01:49,699
It worked.

975
01:01:52,602 --> 01:01:55,004
Okay, so the how works.

976
01:01:55,006 --> 01:01:58,907
Now, we gotta figure out
the when and the where.

977
01:01:58,909 --> 01:02:00,875
Almost everyone in this room
has had an encounter...

978
01:02:00,877 --> 01:02:02,744
with at least one
of the six Infinity Stones.

979
01:02:02,746 --> 01:02:04,479
Or substitute
the word "encounter"...

980
01:02:04,481 --> 01:02:05,613
for "damn near been killed"

981
01:02:05,615 --> 01:02:07,283
by one of the six
Infinity Stones.

982
01:02:07,285 --> 01:02:08,483
Well, I haven't...

983
01:02:08,485 --> 01:02:09,617
but I don't even know

984
01:02:09,619 --> 01:02:10,952
what the hell
you're all talking about.

985
01:02:10,954 --> 01:02:14,122
Regardless, we only have
enough Pym Particles

986
01:02:14,124 --> 01:02:16,090
for one round-trip each.

987
01:02:16,092 --> 01:02:17,125
And these stones have been

988
01:02:17,127 --> 01:02:19,394
in a lot of different places
throughout history.

989
01:02:19,396 --> 01:02:20,762
Our history.

990
01:02:20,764 --> 01:02:23,898
So, not a lot of convenient
spots to just drop in, yeah?

991
01:02:23,900 --> 01:02:25,936
Which means we have
to pick our targets.

992
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:27,704
Correct.

993
01:02:28,805 --> 01:02:30,604
So, let's start
with the Aether.

994
01:02:30,606 --> 01:02:31,975
Thor, what do you know?

995
01:02:37,446 --> 01:02:38,745
Is he asleep?

996
01:02:38,747 --> 01:02:41,583
No, no.
I'm pretty sure he's dead.

997
01:02:44,453 --> 01:02:46,189
Uh, where to start? Um...

998
01:02:47,723 --> 01:02:50,724
The Aether, firstly,
is not a stone.

999
01:02:50,726 --> 01:02:53,727
Someone called it
a stone before.

1000
01:02:53,729 --> 01:02:58,232
Um, it's more of an angry
sludge sort of a thing...

1001
01:02:58,234 --> 01:03:00,000
so someone's gonna need
to amend that

1002
01:03:00,002 --> 01:03:01,501
and stop saying that.

1003
01:03:01,503 --> 01:03:04,272
Here's an interesting story,
though, about the Aether.

1004
01:03:04,274 --> 01:03:06,307
My grandfather,
many years ago...

1005
01:03:06,309 --> 01:03:10,411
had to hide the stone
from the Dark Elves.

1006
01:03:10,413 --> 01:03:12,946
Ooh.
Scary beings.

1007
01:03:12,948 --> 01:03:14,717
So, Jane, actually...

1008
01:03:15,184 --> 01:03:16,984
Oh, there she is.

1009
01:03:16,986 --> 01:03:21,421
Yeah, so Jane was
an old flame of mine.

1010
01:03:21,423 --> 01:03:24,791
You know, she stuck her hand
inside a rock this one time...

1011
01:03:24,793 --> 01:03:28,195
and then the Aether
stuck itself inside her...

1012
01:03:28,197 --> 01:03:29,963
and she became
very, very sick.

1013
01:03:29,965 --> 01:03:32,132
And so I had to
take her to Asgard,

1014
01:03:32,134 --> 01:03:33,400
which is where I'm from...

1015
01:03:33,402 --> 01:03:35,501
and we had to try
and fix her.

1016
01:03:35,503 --> 01:03:37,137
We were dating at the time,
you see...

1017
01:03:37,139 --> 01:03:40,842
and I got to introduce her
to my mother...

1018
01:03:41,910 --> 01:03:44,146
who's dead and, um...

1019
01:03:45,481 --> 01:03:46,980
Oh, you know, Jane and I

1020
01:03:46,982 --> 01:03:49,149
aren't even
dating anymore, so...

1021
01:03:50,085 --> 01:03:51,485
Yes, these things happen,
though. You know?

1022
01:03:51,487 --> 01:03:52,785
Nothing lasts forever.
The only thing that...

1023
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:54,787
- Why don't you come sit down?
- I'm not done yet.

1024
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:56,490
The only thing
that is permanent in life

1025
01:03:56,492 --> 01:03:58,026
is impermanence.

1026
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:01,193
Awesome.
Eggs? Breakfast?

1027
01:04:01,195 --> 01:04:03,162
No. I'd like a Bloody Mary.

1028
01:04:03,164 --> 01:04:06,333
Quill said he stole
the Power Stone from Morag.

1029
01:04:06,335 --> 01:04:09,303
- Is that a person?
- No, Morag's a planet.

1030
01:04:10,071 --> 01:04:11,971
Quill was a person.

1031
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:14,573
Like a planet?
Like in outer space?

1032
01:04:14,575 --> 01:04:15,975
Oh, look.

1033
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:18,878
It's like a little puppy,
all happy and everything.

1034
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:22,348
Do you wanna go to space?
You wanna go to space, puppy?

1035
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:23,651
I'll take you to space.

1036
01:04:24,752 --> 01:04:27,019
Thanos found
the Soul Stone on Vormir.

1037
01:04:27,021 --> 01:04:28,921
What is Vormir?

1038
01:04:28,923 --> 01:04:30,823
A dominion of death...

1039
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:32,927
at the very center
of celestial existence.

1040
01:04:34,661 --> 01:04:38,865
It's where Thanos
murdered my sister.

1041
01:04:45,206 --> 01:04:46,240
Not it.

1042
01:04:47,908 --> 01:04:49,674
- That Time Stone guy.
- Doctor Strange.

1043
01:04:49,676 --> 01:04:51,643
Yeah, what kind
of doctor was he?

1044
01:04:51,645 --> 01:04:53,778
Ear-nose-throat
meets rabbit-from-hat.

1045
01:04:53,780 --> 01:04:55,314
Nice place
in the Village, though.

1046
01:04:55,316 --> 01:04:56,915
Yeah,
on Sullivan Street?

1047
01:04:56,917 --> 01:04:58,249
Mm... Bleecker Street.

1048
01:04:58,251 --> 01:04:59,784
Wait, he lived
in New York?

1049
01:04:59,786 --> 01:05:00,885
No,
he lived in Toronto.

1050
01:05:00,887 --> 01:05:01,986
Uh, yeah, on Bleecker
and Sullivan.

1051
01:05:01,988 --> 01:05:03,254
Have you been listening
to anything?

1052
01:05:03,256 --> 01:05:04,322
Guys.

1053
01:05:04,324 --> 01:05:05,924
If you pick
the right year,

1054
01:05:05,926 --> 01:05:07,828
there are three stones
in New York.

1055
01:05:10,197 --> 01:05:11,965
Shut the front door.

1056
01:05:14,569 --> 01:05:16,801
All right.
We have a plan.

1057
01:05:16,803 --> 01:05:21,674
Six stones, three teams,
one shot.

1058
01:05:31,051 --> 01:05:33,153
<i>Five years ago,
we lost.</i>

1059
01:05:34,421 --> 01:05:35,855
<i>All of us.</i>

1060
01:05:37,591 --> 01:05:39,092
<i>We lost friends.</i>

1061
01:05:39,658 --> 01:05:41,394
<i>We lost family.</i>

1062
01:05:43,363 --> 01:05:45,232
<i>We lost a part of ourselves.</i>

1063
01:05:46,399 --> 01:05:49,068
<i>Today, we have a chance
to take it all back.</i>

1064
01:05:50,203 --> 01:05:53,937
<i>You know your teams.
You know your missions.</i>

1065
01:05:53,939 --> 01:05:56,075
<i>Get the stones.
Get them back.</i>

1066
01:05:56,742 --> 01:05:58,208
One round-trip each.

1067
01:05:58,210 --> 01:05:59,278
No mistakes...

1068
01:05:59,712 --> 01:06:01,579
no do-overs.

1069
01:06:01,581 --> 01:06:03,413
Most of us are going
somewhere we know.

1070
01:06:03,415 --> 01:06:05,684
That doesn't mean
we should know what to expect.

1071
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:07,820
Be careful.

1072
01:06:08,354 --> 01:06:09,755
Look out for each other.

1073
01:06:10,923 --> 01:06:12,958
This is the fight
of our lives...

1074
01:06:13,659 --> 01:06:15,327
and we're gonna win.

1075
01:06:17,463 --> 01:06:18,663
Whatever it takes.

1076
01:06:21,666 --> 01:06:23,367
Good luck.

1077
01:06:23,369 --> 01:06:24,568
He's pretty good at that.

1078
01:06:24,570 --> 01:06:25,836
- Right?
- All right.

1079
01:06:25,838 --> 01:06:26,904
You heard the man.

1080
01:06:26,906 --> 01:06:28,307
Stroke those keys,
Jolly Green.

1081
01:06:29,074 --> 01:06:31,341
Trackers engaged.

1082
01:06:31,343 --> 01:06:33,544
You promise to bring that
back in one piece, right?

1083
01:06:33,546 --> 01:06:35,145
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1084
01:06:35,147 --> 01:06:36,979
Okay, I'll do my best.

1085
01:06:36,981 --> 01:06:39,017
As promises go,
that was pretty lame.

1086
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,189
See ya in a minute.

1087
01:07:37,542 --> 01:07:38,907
All right, we all have
our assignments.

1088
01:07:38,909 --> 01:07:41,244
Two stones uptown,
one stone down.

1089
01:07:41,246 --> 01:07:43,412
Stay low. Keep an eye
on the clock.

1090
01:07:58,730 --> 01:08:00,764
Maybe smash a few things
along the way.

1091
01:08:01,666 --> 01:08:03,867
I think it's gratuitous,
but whatever.

1092
01:08:31,261 --> 01:08:32,893
I'd be careful
going that way.

1093
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:34,797
We just had
the floors waxed.

1094
01:08:39,869 --> 01:08:41,571
Yeah, I'm looking
for Doctor Strange.

1095
01:08:43,039 --> 01:08:46,775
You're about
five years too early.

1096
01:08:46,777 --> 01:08:48,942
Stephen Strange is currently
performing surgery

1097
01:08:48,944 --> 01:08:50,547
about 20 blocks that way.

1098
01:08:52,381 --> 01:08:53,421
What do you want from him?

1099
01:08:54,317 --> 01:08:55,318
That, actually.

1100
01:08:56,285 --> 01:08:57,353
Ah!

1101
01:08:58,487 --> 01:08:59,820
I'm afraid not.

1102
01:08:59,822 --> 01:09:01,324
Sorry, but I wasn't asking.

1103
01:09:02,058 --> 01:09:03,357
You don't want
to do this.

1104
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:04,992
Ah, you're right, I don't.
But I need that stone...

1105
01:09:04,994 --> 01:09:06,595
and I don't have time
to debate it.

1106
01:09:15,604 --> 01:09:17,273
Let's start over, shall we?

1107
01:09:28,718 --> 01:09:30,250
For you, Lady Jane.

1108
01:09:30,252 --> 01:09:32,885
Um, so you have
anything with pants?

1109
01:09:32,887 --> 01:09:34,221
Pants?

1110
01:09:34,223 --> 01:09:36,256
Never mind.
These will be fine. Thank you.

1111
01:09:36,258 --> 01:09:38,539
- Yes, milady.
- Oh, there's Jane.

1112
01:09:39,662 --> 01:09:40,862
All right.

1113
01:09:42,130 --> 01:09:43,664
Here's the deal, tubby.

1114
01:09:43,666 --> 01:09:44,798
You're gonna charm her,

1115
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:46,232
and I'm gonna poke her
with this thing...

1116
01:09:46,234 --> 01:09:48,836
and extract the Reality Stone,
and get gone lickety-split.

1117
01:09:50,472 --> 01:09:51,638
I'll be right back, okay?

1118
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:53,373
The wine cellar
is just down here.

1119
01:09:53,375 --> 01:09:56,409
My father used to have this
huge barrel of Aakonian ale.

1120
01:09:56,411 --> 01:09:57,977
I'll see if the scullery
has a couple of to-go cups.

1121
01:09:57,979 --> 01:09:59,912
Hey. Hey! Aren't you
drunk enough already?

1122
01:10:07,155 --> 01:10:08,421
If you could send Loki
some soup.

1123
01:10:08,423 --> 01:10:09,489
Yes, milady.

1124
01:10:09,491 --> 01:10:10,523
And ask our librarians

1125
01:10:10,525 --> 01:10:13,428
to pull some volumes
from the astronomy shelf.

1126
01:10:19,567 --> 01:10:21,202
Who's the fancy broad?

1127
01:10:22,470 --> 01:10:24,071
That's my mother.

1128
01:10:24,472 --> 01:10:26,241
She dies today.

1129
01:10:26,775 --> 01:10:28,610
Oh, that is today?

1130
01:10:35,048 --> 01:10:38,150
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

1131
01:10:38,152 --> 01:10:39,918
I shouldn't be here.
I shouldn't have come.

1132
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:41,253
It's a bad idea!

1133
01:10:41,255 --> 01:10:42,421
- Come here.
- No, no, no.

1134
01:10:42,423 --> 01:10:45,023
I think I'm having
a panic attack.

1135
01:10:45,025 --> 01:10:46,091
Come here. Right here.

1136
01:10:46,093 --> 01:10:47,926
I shouldn't be here.
This is bad.

1137
01:10:47,928 --> 01:10:49,762
You think you're the
only one who lost people?

1138
01:10:49,764 --> 01:10:51,764
What do you think
we're doing here?

1139
01:10:51,766 --> 01:10:54,032
I lost the only family
I ever had.

1140
01:10:54,034 --> 01:10:56,702
Quill, Groot, Drax,
the chick with the antenna...

1141
01:10:56,704 --> 01:10:58,805
all gone.

1142
01:10:58,807 --> 01:11:00,505
I get you miss
your mom...

1143
01:11:00,507 --> 01:11:01,808
but she's gone.

1144
01:11:01,810 --> 01:11:03,275
Really gone.

1145
01:11:03,277 --> 01:11:06,478
And there are plenty of people
who are only kind of gone...

1146
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:07,581
and you can help them.

1147
01:11:08,682 --> 01:11:10,148
So, is it too much to ask

1148
01:11:10,150 --> 01:11:11,983
that you brush the crumbs
out of your beard...

1149
01:11:11,985 --> 01:11:14,586
make schmoopy talk
to Pretty Pants...

1150
01:11:14,588 --> 01:11:17,823
and when she's not looking,
suck out the Infinity Stone...

1151
01:11:17,825 --> 01:11:19,493
and help me
get my family back?

1152
01:11:20,661 --> 01:11:22,461
Okay.

1153
01:11:22,463 --> 01:11:23,464
Are you crying?

1154
01:11:23,963 --> 01:11:25,399
No.

1155
01:11:27,267 --> 01:11:28,333
Yes.

1156
01:11:28,335 --> 01:11:29,835
I feel like
I'm losing it.

1157
01:11:29,837 --> 01:11:30,902
Get it together!

1158
01:11:30,904 --> 01:11:31,969
You can do this.

1159
01:11:33,039 --> 01:11:34,575
You can do this.

1160
01:11:37,711 --> 01:11:38,844
All right?

1161
01:11:38,846 --> 01:11:39,977
Yes, I can.

1162
01:11:39,979 --> 01:11:41,180
Good.

1163
01:11:43,149 --> 01:11:45,619
I can do this. I can do this.

1164
01:11:46,486 --> 01:11:47,985
I can't do this.

1165
01:11:47,987 --> 01:11:49,955
All right, heartbreaker,
she's alone.

1166
01:11:49,957 --> 01:11:51,655
This is our shot.

1167
01:11:51,657 --> 01:11:54,327
Thor? Thor!

1168
01:12:04,370 --> 01:12:05,971
All right,
bring it down, Blue.

1169
01:12:05,973 --> 01:12:08,508
Right on that line.
That's it. Down, down.

1170
01:12:13,145 --> 01:12:14,912
Hey, can we hurry it up?

1171
01:12:14,914 --> 01:12:17,113
Guys, chop-chop. Come on.
We're on the clock.

1172
01:12:17,115 --> 01:12:19,117
All that is really helpful.

1173
01:12:21,086 --> 01:12:22,620
- Take care, okay?
- Yeah.

1174
01:12:22,622 --> 01:12:25,823
Get that stone and come back.
No messing around.

1175
01:12:25,825 --> 01:12:27,491
- Hey.
- We got this.

1176
01:12:27,493 --> 01:12:28,993
- Let's get it done.
- Yes, sir.

1177
01:12:28,995 --> 01:12:30,995
I'll see you back.

1178
01:12:30,997 --> 01:12:32,465
You guys watch
each other's six.

1179
01:12:32,999 --> 01:12:34,399
Yeah.

1180
01:12:42,942 --> 01:12:44,622
Coordinates
for Vormir are laid in.

1181
01:12:46,077 --> 01:12:48,213
All they have to do
is not fall out.

1182
01:12:53,953 --> 01:12:56,519
We're a long way
from Budapest.

1183
01:13:01,159 --> 01:13:03,760
Okay, so, uh...

1184
01:13:03,762 --> 01:13:07,263
we just wait around for
this Quill guy to show up...

1185
01:13:07,265 --> 01:13:09,334
and then he leads us to the Power
Stone, is that it?

1186
01:13:10,135 --> 01:13:11,670
Let's take cover.

1187
01:13:12,971 --> 01:13:15,605
We're not the only ones in
2014 looking for the stones.

1188
01:13:15,607 --> 01:13:17,205
Wait a minute.
What are you talking about right now?

1189
01:13:17,207 --> 01:13:18,677
Who else is looking
for these stones?

1190
01:13:22,179 --> 01:13:23,846
My father...

1191
01:13:23,848 --> 01:13:25,815
my sister...

1192
01:13:25,817 --> 01:13:27,050
and me.

1193
01:13:27,052 --> 01:13:28,385
And you?

1194
01:13:30,087 --> 01:13:31,756
Where are you right now?

1195
01:14:00,317 --> 01:14:01,783
You're welcome.

1196
01:14:01,785 --> 01:14:04,753
I didn't ask for your help.

1197
01:14:04,755 --> 01:14:06,457
And yet, you always need it.

1198
01:14:10,294 --> 01:14:12,628
Get up. Father wants us
back on the ship.

1199
01:14:12,630 --> 01:14:13,762
Why?

1200
01:14:13,764 --> 01:14:15,766
He's found an Infinity Stone.

1201
01:14:20,169 --> 01:14:21,703
Where?

1202
01:14:21,705 --> 01:14:23,674
On a planet
called Morag.

1203
01:14:25,174 --> 01:14:27,241
Father's plan
is finally in motion.

1204
01:14:27,243 --> 01:14:29,578
One stone isn't six, Nebula.

1205
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:30,879
It's a start.

1206
01:14:30,881 --> 01:14:32,716
If he gets all of them...

1207
01:14:45,528 --> 01:14:47,395
Ronan's located
the Power Stone.

1208
01:14:47,397 --> 01:14:49,296
I'm dispatching you
to his ship.

1209
01:14:49,298 --> 01:14:50,798
He won't like that.

1210
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,902
His alternative is death.

1211
01:14:54,337 --> 01:14:56,305
Ronan's obsession...

1212
01:14:57,141 --> 01:14:59,475
clouds his judgment.

1213
01:15:03,813 --> 01:15:05,648
We will not fail you, Father.

1214
01:15:06,683 --> 01:15:08,384
No, you won't.

1215
01:15:10,953 --> 01:15:11,954
I swear...

1216
01:15:13,856 --> 01:15:15,792
I will make you proud.

1217
01:15:23,900 --> 01:15:27,768
<i>...we just wait around for
this Quill guy to show up...</i>

1218
01:15:27,770 --> 01:15:30,104
<i>and then he leads us to the
Power Stone, is that it?</i>

1219
01:15:30,106 --> 01:15:32,572
<i>Let's take cover.</i>

1220
01:15:32,574 --> 01:15:34,474
<i>We're not the only ones
in 2014</i>

1221
01:15:34,476 --> 01:15:35,677
<i>looking for the stones.</i>

1222
01:15:38,014 --> 01:15:39,512
Who was that?

1223
01:15:39,514 --> 01:15:40,647
I don't know.

1224
01:15:40,649 --> 01:15:42,985
My head is splitting.
I don't know.

1225
01:15:44,352 --> 01:15:47,522
Her synaptic drive was
probably damaged in battle.

1226
01:15:48,057 --> 01:15:49,524
Shh.

1227
01:15:57,733 --> 01:15:59,768
Bring her to my ship.

1228
01:16:07,142 --> 01:16:08,475
Better hustle, Cap.

1229
01:16:08,477 --> 01:16:10,210
Things look like they're
just about wrapped up here.

1230
01:16:10,212 --> 01:16:12,493
<i>Got it.
I'm approaching the elevator now.</i>

1231
01:16:18,553 --> 01:16:20,421
If it's all
the same to you...

1232
01:16:22,456 --> 01:16:24,523
I'll have
that drink now.

1233
01:16:24,525 --> 01:16:26,226
All right,
get him on his feet.

1234
01:16:26,228 --> 01:16:29,361
We can all stand around
posing up a storm later.

1235
01:16:29,363 --> 01:16:30,897
By the way, feel free
to clean up.

1236
01:16:30,899 --> 01:16:34,100
Mr. Rogers,
I almost forgot that that suit...

1237
01:16:34,102 --> 01:16:35,734
did nothing for your ass.

1238
01:16:35,736 --> 01:16:37,302
<i>No one
asked you to look, Tony.</i>

1239
01:16:37,304 --> 01:16:38,437
It's ridiculous.

1240
01:16:38,439 --> 01:16:39,738
<i>I think
you look great, Cap.</i>

1241
01:16:39,740 --> 01:16:42,242
<i>As far as I'm concerned,
that's America's ass.</i>

1242
01:16:42,244 --> 01:16:44,177
Who gets
the, uh, magic wand?

1243
01:16:44,179 --> 01:16:45,410
S.T.R.I.K.E. team's

1244
01:16:45,412 --> 01:16:47,012
coming to secure it.

1245
01:16:56,490 --> 01:16:58,423
We can take that
off your hands.

1246
01:16:58,425 --> 01:16:59,627
By all means.

1247
01:17:01,829 --> 01:17:03,529
Careful with that thing.

1248
01:17:03,531 --> 01:17:05,230
Yeah, unless you want
your mind erased.

1249
01:17:05,232 --> 01:17:06,330
And not in a fun way.

1250
01:17:06,332 --> 01:17:07,533
We promise to be careful.

1251
01:17:07,535 --> 01:17:08,834
<i>Who are these guys?</i>

1252
01:17:08,836 --> 01:17:10,002
They are S.H.I.E.L.D.

1253
01:17:10,004 --> 01:17:13,404
Well, actually Hydra,
but we didn't know that yet.

1254
01:17:13,406 --> 01:17:15,674
<i>Seriously?
You didn't?</i>

1255
01:17:15,676 --> 01:17:17,408
<i>I mean, they look
like bad guys.</i>

1256
01:17:17,410 --> 01:17:18,877
You're small,
but you're talking loud.

1257
01:17:18,879 --> 01:17:20,879
On my way down to coordinate
search and rescue.

1258
01:17:20,881 --> 01:17:22,981
On my way down to coordinate
search and rescue.

1259
01:17:22,983 --> 01:17:25,884
I mean, honestly,
how do you keep your food down?

1260
01:17:25,886 --> 01:17:27,685
Shut up.

1261
01:17:27,687 --> 01:17:29,254
Ooh. All right, you're up,
little buddy.

1262
01:17:29,256 --> 01:17:31,489
There's our stone.

1263
01:17:31,491 --> 01:17:32,825
<i>All right.</i>

1264
01:17:32,827 --> 01:17:33,961
<i>Flick me.</i>

1265
01:17:48,041 --> 01:17:49,174
- Move.
- Hey.

1266
01:17:49,176 --> 01:17:50,908
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Hey, hey. Buddy!

1267
01:17:50,910 --> 01:17:53,010
What do you think?
Maximum occupancy has been reached.

1268
01:17:53,012 --> 01:17:54,213
Take the stairs.

1269
01:17:54,215 --> 01:17:55,947
Yeah. Stop, stop.

1270
01:17:58,718 --> 01:18:02,422
"Take the stairs."
Hate the stairs.

1271
01:18:05,124 --> 01:18:07,959
All right, Cap, I got
our scepter in the elevator...

1272
01:18:07,961 --> 01:18:09,796
just passing the 80th floor.

1273
01:18:10,630 --> 01:18:11,631
On it.

1274
01:18:12,098 --> 01:18:13,297
Head to the lobby.

1275
01:18:13,299 --> 01:18:14,497
<i>All right,
I'll see you there.</i>

1276
01:18:14,499 --> 01:18:16,300
Evidence secure.

1277
01:18:16,302 --> 01:18:18,401
We're en route
to Doctor List.

1278
01:18:18,403 --> 01:18:21,506
No. No hitches at all,
Mr. Secretary.

1279
01:18:26,645 --> 01:18:27,510
Captain.

1280
01:18:27,512 --> 01:18:28,880
I thought
you were coordinating

1281
01:18:28,882 --> 01:18:29,746
search and rescue.

1282
01:18:29,748 --> 01:18:31,583
Change of plans.

1283
01:18:35,255 --> 01:18:36,788
Hey, Cap.

1284
01:18:38,024 --> 01:18:39,058
Rumlow.

1285
01:18:45,298 --> 01:18:47,298
I just got a call
from the secretary.

1286
01:18:47,300 --> 01:18:49,401
I'm gonna be running point
on the scepter.

1287
01:18:51,603 --> 01:18:54,006
Sir? I don't understand.

1288
01:18:56,376 --> 01:18:58,376
We got word there may be
an attempt to steal it.

1289
01:18:58,378 --> 01:19:00,176
Sorry, Cap.

1290
01:19:00,178 --> 01:19:01,978
We can't give you
the scepter.

1291
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:04,214
I'm gonna have to call
the director.

1292
01:19:04,216 --> 01:19:06,518
That's okay. Trust me.

1293
01:19:09,922 --> 01:19:10,923
Hail Hydra.

1294
01:19:25,503 --> 01:19:27,469
So many stairs!

1295
01:19:38,983 --> 01:19:42,017
Thumbelina, do you copy?
I've got eyes on the prize.

1296
01:19:42,019 --> 01:19:42,952
It is go time.

1297
01:19:42,954 --> 01:19:44,274
<i>Bombs away.</i>

1298
01:19:51,430 --> 01:19:53,862
<i>Is that Axe Body Spray?</i>

1299
01:19:53,864 --> 01:19:56,365
Yeah, I had a can in the desk
for emergencies. Relax.

1300
01:19:56,367 --> 01:19:57,566
Can we focus, please?

1301
01:19:57,568 --> 01:19:58,970
<i>I'm going inside you...</i>

1302
01:19:59,737 --> 01:20:00,738
<i>now.</i>

1303
01:20:06,444 --> 01:20:07,943
Uh, may I ask you
where you're going?

1304
01:20:07,945 --> 01:20:10,478
Bit of lunch and then Asgard.
I'm sorry, you are...?

1305
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:11,612
Alexander Pierce.

1306
01:20:11,614 --> 01:20:13,115
He's the man
above the folks

1307
01:20:13,117 --> 01:20:14,316
- behind Nick Fury.
- Oh.

1308
01:20:14,318 --> 01:20:15,550
My friends call me
Mr. Secretary.

1309
01:20:15,552 --> 01:20:16,617
I'm gonna have to ask you

1310
01:20:16,619 --> 01:20:17,920
to turn that prisoner
over to me.

1311
01:20:17,922 --> 01:20:19,888
Uh, Loki will be answering
to Odin himself.

1312
01:20:19,890 --> 01:20:21,223
No, he's going
to answer to us.

1313
01:20:21,225 --> 01:20:22,590
Odin can have what's left.

1314
01:20:22,592 --> 01:20:24,093
And I'm gonna need
that case.

1315
01:20:24,095 --> 01:20:26,261
That's been S.H.I.E.L.D.
property for over 70 years.

1316
01:20:26,263 --> 01:20:27,528
Hand over the case, Stark.

1317
01:20:27,530 --> 01:20:28,796
All right,
move it, Stuart Little.

1318
01:20:28,798 --> 01:20:30,165
Things are getting dicey
out here. Let's go.

1319
01:20:30,167 --> 01:20:32,334
I'm not gonna argue who's got
the higher authority here...

1320
01:20:32,336 --> 01:20:33,701
<i>You promise me
you won't die?</i>

1321
01:20:33,703 --> 01:20:36,604
We're only giving me
a mild cardiac dysrhythmia.

1322
01:20:36,606 --> 01:20:38,407
<i>That doesn't sound mild.</i>

1323
01:20:38,409 --> 01:20:39,574
I need the case.

1324
01:20:39,576 --> 01:20:40,908
I know you got a lot of
pull, I'm just saying,

1325
01:20:40,910 --> 01:20:42,444
- jurisdiction...
- Okay, then give me the case.

1326
01:20:42,446 --> 01:20:43,511
Well, jurisdiction...

1327
01:20:43,513 --> 01:20:44,579
Hand it over.

1328
01:20:44,581 --> 01:20:45,646
Do it, Lang!

1329
01:20:45,648 --> 01:20:46,714
Get your hands off me.

1330
01:20:46,716 --> 01:20:48,649
Window's closing.
Pull my pin.

1331
01:20:48,651 --> 01:20:50,118
<i>Here goes!</i>

1332
01:20:52,722 --> 01:20:54,557
- Stark?
- Stark?

1333
01:20:55,625 --> 01:20:57,025
He's convulsing.
Give him air!

1334
01:20:57,027 --> 01:20:59,227
- Medic!
- Medic!

1335
01:20:59,229 --> 01:21:00,828
Give these guys
some help.

1336
01:21:00,830 --> 01:21:02,397
Speak to me.

1337
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:04,234
Stark,
is it your chest machine?

1338
01:21:07,037 --> 01:21:08,304
Breathe, breathe.

1339
01:21:13,510 --> 01:21:14,775
Good job.
Meet me in the alley.

1340
01:21:14,777 --> 01:21:15,979
I'm gonna grab
a quick slice.

1341
01:21:21,550 --> 01:21:23,617
No stairs!

1342
01:21:30,427 --> 01:21:32,793
Uh... Come on, Stark,
stay with us.

1343
01:21:32,795 --> 01:21:33,860
I'm going to
try something. Okay?

1344
01:21:33,862 --> 01:21:35,729
I have no idea
if it's going to work.

1345
01:21:35,731 --> 01:21:38,165
Yes!

1346
01:21:38,167 --> 01:21:39,599
Oh, that worked a treat.

1347
01:21:39,601 --> 01:21:40,734
Dude, that was so crazy.

1348
01:21:40,736 --> 01:21:42,370
I had no idea
if that was gonna work.

1349
01:21:42,372 --> 01:21:44,405
- The case.
- The case is, uh...

1350
01:21:44,407 --> 01:21:46,608
Where's the case?
Where's Loki?

1351
01:21:47,410 --> 01:21:48,742
Loki!

1352
01:21:48,744 --> 01:21:50,110
<i>That wasn't
supposed to happen, was it?</i>

1353
01:21:50,112 --> 01:21:51,244
Oh, we blew it.

1354
01:21:51,246 --> 01:21:52,712
Loki?

1355
01:21:54,683 --> 01:21:56,118
Tony, what's going on?

1356
01:21:56,919 --> 01:21:58,854
Tell me you found that Cube.

1357
01:22:01,557 --> 01:22:03,092
Oh, you gotta be
shitting me.

1358
01:22:06,962 --> 01:22:09,463
I have eyes on Loki.
14th floor.

1359
01:22:09,465 --> 01:22:10,966
I'm not Loki...

1360
01:22:14,436 --> 01:22:16,138
and I don't wanna
hurt you.

1361
01:22:24,879 --> 01:22:26,213
I can do this all day.

1362
01:22:26,215 --> 01:22:27,581
Yeah, I know.

1363
01:22:27,583 --> 01:22:28,783
I know.

1364
01:23:01,382 --> 01:23:02,383
Where did you get this?

1365
01:23:13,628 --> 01:23:16,863
Bucky is alive.

1366
01:23:20,301 --> 01:23:21,335
What?

1367
01:23:36,283 --> 01:23:37,918
That is America's ass.

1368
01:23:42,222 --> 01:23:43,154
Please, please.

1369
01:23:43,156 --> 01:23:45,258
I'm sorry,
I can't help you, Bruce.

1370
01:23:46,092 --> 01:23:47,626
If I give up
the Time Stone

1371
01:23:47,628 --> 01:23:49,527
to help your reality,
I'm dooming my own.

1372
01:23:49,529 --> 01:23:51,262
With all due respect,
all right...

1373
01:23:51,264 --> 01:23:54,734
I'm not sure the science
really supports that.

1374
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:02,073
The Infinity Stones create

1375
01:24:02,075 --> 01:24:04,609
what you experience
as the flow of time.

1376
01:24:04,611 --> 01:24:06,377
Remove one of the stones...

1377
01:24:06,379 --> 01:24:08,580
and that flow splits.

1378
01:24:08,582 --> 01:24:11,082
Now, this may benefit
your reality...

1379
01:24:11,084 --> 01:24:13,685
but my new one,
not so much.

1380
01:24:13,687 --> 01:24:15,587
In this new branch reality...

1381
01:24:15,589 --> 01:24:17,388
without our chief weapon

1382
01:24:17,390 --> 01:24:18,989
against the forces
of darkness...

1383
01:24:18,991 --> 01:24:21,259
our world would be overrun.

1384
01:24:21,261 --> 01:24:23,160
Millions will suffer.

1385
01:24:23,162 --> 01:24:24,828
So, tell me, Doctor.

1386
01:24:24,830 --> 01:24:27,298
Can your science
prevent all that?

1387
01:24:27,300 --> 01:24:28,301
No...

1388
01:24:29,302 --> 01:24:30,335
but we can erase it.

1389
01:24:30,337 --> 01:24:32,236
Because once we're done
with the stones...

1390
01:24:32,238 --> 01:24:34,706
we can return each one
to its own timeline...

1391
01:24:34,708 --> 01:24:36,441
at the moment it was taken.

1392
01:24:36,443 --> 01:24:39,011
So, chronologically...

1393
01:24:39,845 --> 01:24:41,080
in that reality...

1394
01:24:43,549 --> 01:24:45,284
it never left.

1395
01:24:47,386 --> 01:24:50,856
Yes, but you're leaving out
the most important part.

1396
01:24:54,126 --> 01:24:56,827
In order to return the stones,
you have to survive.

1397
01:24:56,829 --> 01:25:00,163
We will. I will.
I promise.

1398
01:25:00,165 --> 01:25:02,401
I can't risk this reality
on a promise.

1399
01:25:03,936 --> 01:25:06,802
It's the duty
of the Sorcerer Supreme

1400
01:25:06,804 --> 01:25:08,938
to protect the Time Stone.

1401
01:25:08,940 --> 01:25:11,042
Then why the hell
did Strange give it away?

1402
01:25:12,810 --> 01:25:14,010
What did you say?

1403
01:25:14,012 --> 01:25:16,482
Strange. He gave it away.
He gave it to Thanos.

1404
01:25:16,981 --> 01:25:18,850
- Willingly?
- Yes.

1405
01:25:22,588 --> 01:25:24,388
- Why?
- I have no idea.

1406
01:25:24,390 --> 01:25:26,190
Maybe he made a mistake.

1407
01:25:36,301 --> 01:25:37,536
Or I did.

1408
01:25:57,755 --> 01:26:00,222
Strange is meant to be
the best of us.

1409
01:26:00,224 --> 01:26:03,027
So, he must've done it
for a reason.

1410
01:26:03,661 --> 01:26:05,363
I fear you might be right.

1411
01:26:10,501 --> 01:26:11,502
Thank you.

1412
01:26:17,709 --> 01:26:19,444
I'm counting on you, Bruce.

1413
01:26:21,479 --> 01:26:22,846
We all are.

1414
01:26:43,033 --> 01:26:44,868
Run diagnostics.

1415
01:26:45,469 --> 01:26:47,437
Show me her memory file.

1416
01:26:48,905 --> 01:26:51,475
Sire, the file
appears entangled.

1417
01:26:52,609 --> 01:26:54,578
It was a memory,
but not hers.

1418
01:26:55,779 --> 01:26:57,445
There's another
consciousness...

1419
01:26:57,447 --> 01:26:58,881
sharing her network.

1420
01:26:59,316 --> 01:27:00,584
Another Nebula.

1421
01:27:02,686 --> 01:27:04,185
Impossible.

1422
01:27:04,187 --> 01:27:07,822
This duplicate
carries a time stamp...

1423
01:27:07,824 --> 01:27:10,159
from nine years
in the future.

1424
01:27:14,631 --> 01:27:17,766
Where is this other Nebula?

1425
01:27:17,768 --> 01:27:19,969
In our
solar system on Morag.

1426
01:27:21,405 --> 01:27:22,771
Can you access her?

1427
01:27:22,773 --> 01:27:24,938
Yes,
the two are linked.

1428
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:27,141
Search the duplicate's
memories...

1429
01:27:27,143 --> 01:27:29,512
for Infinity Stones.

1430
01:27:32,948 --> 01:27:34,281
<i>And these stones have been</i>

1431
01:27:34,283 --> 01:27:36,049
<i>in a lot of different places
throughout history.</i>

1432
01:27:36,051 --> 01:27:37,184
<i>Our history.</i>

1433
01:27:37,186 --> 01:27:39,620
<i>So, not a lot
of convenient spots</i>

1434
01:27:39,622 --> 01:27:40,755
<i>to just drop in.</i>

1435
01:27:40,757 --> 01:27:42,523
<i>Which means
we have to pick our targets.</i>

1436
01:27:42,525 --> 01:27:44,160
<i>- Correct.</i>
- Freeze image.

1437
01:27:45,928 --> 01:27:47,296
Terrans.

1438
01:27:48,364 --> 01:27:50,099
Avengers.

1439
01:27:50,966 --> 01:27:52,866
Unruly wretches.

1440
01:27:52,868 --> 01:27:54,470
What's that reflection?

1441
01:27:55,970 --> 01:27:57,306
Amplify this, Maw.

1442
01:28:00,709 --> 01:28:02,076
I don't understand.

1443
01:28:06,649 --> 01:28:08,248
Two Nebulas.

1444
01:28:08,250 --> 01:28:10,985
No.
The same Nebula...

1445
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:13,422
from two different times.

1446
01:28:14,657 --> 01:28:16,322
Set course for Morag.

1447
01:28:16,324 --> 01:28:18,993
And scan
the duplicate's memories.

1448
01:28:19,595 --> 01:28:22,096
I wanna see everything.

1449
01:28:31,807 --> 01:28:33,841
My ladies,
I'll see you after.

1450
01:28:33,843 --> 01:28:35,376
I'll see you after.
Go on ahead.

1451
01:28:49,691 --> 01:28:50,756
What are you doing?

1452
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:53,493
Oh, God!

1453
01:28:53,495 --> 01:28:56,162
You're better off leaving
the sneaking to your brother.

1454
01:28:56,164 --> 01:28:58,197
No, I wasn't sneaking.
I was just going for a walk.

1455
01:28:58,199 --> 01:28:59,599
What are you wearing?

1456
01:28:59,601 --> 01:29:02,167
I always wear this.
It's one of my favorites.

1457
01:29:05,072 --> 01:29:06,171
Mm...

1458
01:29:06,173 --> 01:29:07,807
What's wrong
with your eye?

1459
01:29:07,809 --> 01:29:08,941
Oh, my eye.

1460
01:29:08,943 --> 01:29:11,042
Remember the, uh,
Battle of Harokin...

1461
01:29:11,044 --> 01:29:12,310
when I got hit
in the face

1462
01:29:12,312 --> 01:29:14,314
with the broadsword?

1463
01:29:17,519 --> 01:29:19,754
You're not the Thor
I know at all, are you?

1464
01:29:20,555 --> 01:29:22,554
Yes, I am.

1465
01:29:22,556 --> 01:29:25,524
The future hasn't been kind
to you, has it?

1466
01:29:25,526 --> 01:29:28,026
I didn't say
I was from the future.

1467
01:29:28,028 --> 01:29:31,496
I was raised by witches, boy.

1468
01:29:31,498 --> 01:29:34,201
I see with more than eyes,
you know that.

1469
01:29:36,069 --> 01:29:38,603
Yeah,
I'm totally from the future.

1470
01:29:38,605 --> 01:29:40,238
Yes, you are, honey.

1471
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:41,974
I really need
to talk to you.

1472
01:29:41,976 --> 01:29:43,176
We can talk.

1473
01:30:07,099 --> 01:30:09,768
His head was over there...

1474
01:30:09,770 --> 01:30:13,170
and his body over there...

1475
01:30:13,172 --> 01:30:16,741
I mean, what was
the point? I was too late.

1476
01:30:16,743 --> 01:30:18,444
I was just standing there.

1477
01:30:19,211 --> 01:30:21,145
Some idiot with an axe.

1478
01:30:21,147 --> 01:30:23,115
Now,
you're no idiot.

1479
01:30:24,017 --> 01:30:25,649
You're here, aren't you?

1480
01:30:25,651 --> 01:30:28,686
Seeking counsel from
the wisest person in Asgard.

1481
01:30:28,688 --> 01:30:29,854
I am. Yes.

1482
01:30:29,856 --> 01:30:31,455
Idiot, no.

1483
01:30:31,457 --> 01:30:32,991
A failure?

1484
01:30:32,993 --> 01:30:34,224
Absolutely.

1485
01:30:34,226 --> 01:30:36,193
That's a little bit harsh.

1486
01:30:36,195 --> 01:30:37,797
Do you know
what that makes you?

1487
01:30:38,966 --> 01:30:41,098
Just like everyone else.

1488
01:30:41,100 --> 01:30:43,434
I'm not supposed to be
like everyone else, am I?

1489
01:30:43,436 --> 01:30:44,602
Mm.

1490
01:30:44,604 --> 01:30:48,305
Everyone fails at who
they're supposed to be, Thor.

1491
01:30:48,307 --> 01:30:51,475
The measure of a person,
of a hero...

1492
01:30:51,477 --> 01:30:55,180
is how well they succeed
at being who they are.

1493
01:31:00,185 --> 01:31:01,754
I've really
missed you, Mom.

1494
01:31:07,660 --> 01:31:09,461
Thor! I got it!

1495
01:31:10,161 --> 01:31:11,797
Get that rabbit!

1496
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:16,599
Mom, I have to
tell you something.

1497
01:31:16,601 --> 01:31:18,368
No, son, you don't.

1498
01:31:18,370 --> 01:31:21,105
You're here to repair
your future, not mine.

1499
01:31:21,107 --> 01:31:22,906
This is about your future.

1500
01:31:22,908 --> 01:31:24,442
Uh, it's none of
my business.

1501
01:31:28,446 --> 01:31:29,779
Hi.

1502
01:31:29,781 --> 01:31:31,714
You must be Mom.

1503
01:31:31,716 --> 01:31:33,416
I got the thing.
Come on. We gotta move.

1504
01:31:33,418 --> 01:31:35,119
Oh, I wish
we had more time.

1505
01:31:35,121 --> 01:31:37,121
No, this was a gift.

1506
01:31:37,123 --> 01:31:41,024
Now you go and be the man
you're meant to be.

1507
01:31:41,026 --> 01:31:42,158
I love you, Mom.

1508
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:43,361
I love you.

1509
01:31:47,732 --> 01:31:49,668
And eat a salad.

1510
01:31:50,669 --> 01:31:51,901
Come on, we gotta go.

1511
01:31:51,903 --> 01:31:53,703
- Goodbye.
- Three...

1512
01:31:53,705 --> 01:31:54,773
- Two...
- No, wait!

1513
01:31:57,976 --> 01:31:59,274
What am I looking at?

1514
01:31:59,276 --> 01:32:00,845
Oh, sometimes
it takes a second.

1515
01:32:10,254 --> 01:32:12,456
I'm still worthy.

1516
01:32:13,792 --> 01:32:15,492
Oh, boy.

1517
01:32:16,427 --> 01:32:18,562
- Goodbye, Mom.
- Goodbye.

1518
01:32:57,768 --> 01:32:59,470
So, he's an idiot?

1519
01:33:00,738 --> 01:33:02,271
Yeah.

1520
01:33:10,681 --> 01:33:11,980
What's that?

1521
01:33:11,982 --> 01:33:13,884
The tool of a thief.

1522
01:33:21,557 --> 01:33:23,491
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1523
01:33:23,493 --> 01:33:25,326
This is the part
where spikes come out...

1524
01:33:25,328 --> 01:33:26,995
with skeletons on the end
of them and everything.

1525
01:33:26,997 --> 01:33:28,295
What are you
talking about?

1526
01:33:28,297 --> 01:33:29,396
When you break into
a place called

1527
01:33:29,398 --> 01:33:30,698
"The Temple
of the Power Stone"...

1528
01:33:30,700 --> 01:33:32,266
there's gonna be
a bunch of booby traps.

1529
01:33:32,268 --> 01:33:34,670
- Oh, my God.
- Okay. All right. Go ahead.

1530
01:34:07,904 --> 01:34:09,504
I wasn't always like this.

1531
01:34:10,239 --> 01:34:11,439
Me either.

1532
01:34:13,075 --> 01:34:14,643
But we work
with what we got, right?

1533
01:34:16,212 --> 01:34:17,479
Hmm.

1534
01:34:18,247 --> 01:34:19,982
Let's sync up.

1535
01:34:21,883 --> 01:34:24,452
Three, two, one.

1536
01:34:37,132 --> 01:34:38,765
<i>You murdered trillions!</i>

1537
01:34:38,767 --> 01:34:40,266
<i>You should be grateful.</i>

1538
01:34:41,803 --> 01:34:43,803
<i>Where are the stones?</i>

1539
01:34:43,805 --> 01:34:44,806
<i>Gone.</i>

1540
01:34:45,407 --> 01:34:47,173
<i>Reduced to atoms.</i>

1541
01:34:47,175 --> 01:34:48,942
<i>You used them
two days ago!</i>

1542
01:34:48,944 --> 01:34:52,278
<i>I used the stones
to destroy the stones.</i>

1543
01:34:52,280 --> 01:34:54,280
<i>It nearly killed me.</i>

1544
01:34:54,282 --> 01:34:56,348
<i>But the work is done.</i>

1545
01:34:56,350 --> 01:34:58,419
<i>It always will be.</i>

1546
01:34:59,453 --> 01:35:03,024
<i>I am inevitable.</i>

1547
01:35:04,226 --> 01:35:06,391
What did you do
to them?

1548
01:35:06,393 --> 01:35:07,796
Nothing.

1549
01:35:08,696 --> 01:35:09,931
Yet.

1550
01:35:11,565 --> 01:35:13,565
They're not trying
to stop something

1551
01:35:13,567 --> 01:35:15,601
I'm going to do
in our time.

1552
01:35:15,603 --> 01:35:17,669
They're trying
to undo something

1553
01:35:17,671 --> 01:35:19,438
I've already done
in theirs.

1554
01:35:19,440 --> 01:35:21,375
The stones.

1555
01:35:22,110 --> 01:35:24,044
I found them all.

1556
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:27,779
I won.

1557
01:35:27,781 --> 01:35:30,951
Tipped the cosmic scales
to balance.

1558
01:35:34,955 --> 01:35:37,022
This is your future.

1559
01:35:37,024 --> 01:35:39,059
It's my destiny.

1560
01:35:40,227 --> 01:35:42,394
<i>My father is many things.</i>

1561
01:35:42,396 --> 01:35:44,465
<i>A liar is not one of them.</i>

1562
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,001
<i>Ah.</i>

1563
01:35:48,035 --> 01:35:50,102
<i>Thank you, daughter.</i>

1564
01:35:50,104 --> 01:35:52,503
<i>Perhaps I treated you
too harshly.</i>

1565
01:35:56,643 --> 01:35:59,747
And that is
destiny fulfilled.

1566
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:01,512
Sire...

1567
01:36:01,514 --> 01:36:03,115
your daughter...

1568
01:36:05,185 --> 01:36:06,550
No!

1569
01:36:06,552 --> 01:36:07,718
...is a traitor.

1570
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:10,421
That's not me.
It's not, I could never...

1571
01:36:10,423 --> 01:36:11,889
I would never betray you.

1572
01:36:11,891 --> 01:36:13,760
Never. Never.

1573
01:36:19,366 --> 01:36:21,465
I know.

1574
01:36:21,467 --> 01:36:24,871
And you'll have the chance
to prove it.

1575
01:36:31,110 --> 01:36:32,178
No!

1576
01:36:32,946 --> 01:36:34,113
He knows!

1577
01:36:38,584 --> 01:36:40,820
Barton! Barton, come in.

1578
01:36:41,321 --> 01:36:43,254
Romanoff!

1579
01:36:43,256 --> 01:36:44,922
Come in, we have a problem.

1580
01:36:44,924 --> 01:36:46,157
Come on!

1581
01:36:46,159 --> 01:36:47,825
Come in, we have a...

1582
01:36:47,827 --> 01:36:49,095
Thanos knows.

1583
01:36:49,829 --> 01:36:51,030
Thanos...

1584
01:37:04,810 --> 01:37:05,877
Cap.

1585
01:37:07,380 --> 01:37:09,679
Sorry, buddy,
we got a problem.

1586
01:37:09,681 --> 01:37:12,383
Yeah, we do.

1587
01:37:12,385 --> 01:37:13,583
Well,
what are we gonna do now?

1588
01:37:13,585 --> 01:37:14,651
You know what?
Give me a break, Steve.

1589
01:37:14,653 --> 01:37:16,019
I just got hit in the head
with the Hulk.

1590
01:37:16,021 --> 01:37:17,988
You said
that we had one shot.

1591
01:37:17,990 --> 01:37:19,190
This was our shot.

1592
01:37:19,192 --> 01:37:21,325
We shot it. It's shot.
Six stones or nothing.

1593
01:37:21,327 --> 01:37:22,959
- It was six stones or nothing.
- You're repeating yourself,

1594
01:37:22,961 --> 01:37:24,295
you know that?
You're repeating yourself.

1595
01:37:24,297 --> 01:37:26,096
You're repeating yourself.
You're repeating yourself.

1596
01:37:26,098 --> 01:37:26,963
Dude. Come on!

1597
01:37:26,965 --> 01:37:28,098
No. You never wanted
a time heist.

1598
01:37:28,100 --> 01:37:29,599
You weren't on board
with the time heist.

1599
01:37:29,601 --> 01:37:30,667
- I dropped the ball.
- You ruined the time heist.

1600
01:37:30,669 --> 01:37:31,901
- Is that what I did?
- Yeah.

1601
01:37:31,903 --> 01:37:33,870
Are there any other options
with the Tesseract?

1602
01:37:33,872 --> 01:37:35,372
No, no, no, there's
no other options.

1603
01:37:35,374 --> 01:37:36,773
There's no do-overs.

1604
01:37:36,775 --> 01:37:39,009
We're not going anywhere else.
We have one particle left.

1605
01:37:39,011 --> 01:37:39,909
Each.

1606
01:37:39,911 --> 01:37:42,479
That's it. All right?
We use that...

1607
01:37:42,481 --> 01:37:43,780
bye-bye,
you're not going home.

1608
01:37:43,782 --> 01:37:45,849
Yeah, well,
if we don't try...

1609
01:37:45,851 --> 01:37:47,317
then no one else
is going home, either.

1610
01:37:47,319 --> 01:37:48,519
I got it.

1611
01:37:49,488 --> 01:37:51,755
There's another way
to retake the Tesseract

1612
01:37:51,757 --> 01:37:54,391
and acquire new particles.

1613
01:37:54,393 --> 01:37:56,059
Little stroll down
memory lane.

1614
01:37:56,061 --> 01:37:58,130
Military installation,
Garden State.

1615
01:38:02,200 --> 01:38:03,366
When were they both there?

1616
01:38:03,368 --> 01:38:06,602
They were there at a time...
I have a vaguely exact idea.

1617
01:38:06,604 --> 01:38:07,669
- How vague?
- What are you talking about?

1618
01:38:07,671 --> 01:38:08,804
Where are we going?

1619
01:38:08,806 --> 01:38:09,838
I know for a fact
they were there.

1620
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:11,107
Who's they?
What are we doing?

1621
01:38:11,109 --> 01:38:12,177
And I know how I know.

1622
01:38:14,111 --> 01:38:16,212
Guys, what is it?

1623
01:38:16,214 --> 01:38:17,880
Looks like
we're improvising.

1624
01:38:17,882 --> 01:38:19,282
- Great.
- What are we improvising?

1625
01:38:19,284 --> 01:38:21,216
Scott, get this back
to the compound.

1626
01:38:21,218 --> 01:38:22,419
Suit up.

1627
01:38:22,421 --> 01:38:24,019
- What's in New Jersey?
- 0-4.

1628
01:38:24,021 --> 01:38:25,120
0-4.

1629
01:38:25,122 --> 01:38:26,255
- Uh, 0-7.
- 0-7.

1630
01:38:26,257 --> 01:38:28,525
- Excuse me.
- 1-9-7-0.

1631
01:38:28,527 --> 01:38:29,591
Are you sure?

1632
01:38:29,593 --> 01:38:31,160
Cap? Captain?

1633
01:38:31,162 --> 01:38:33,162
Steve? Sorry.

1634
01:38:33,164 --> 01:38:34,797
America. Rogers.

1635
01:38:34,799 --> 01:38:36,198
Look, if you do this...

1636
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:39,036
and it doesn't work,
you're not coming back.

1637
01:38:39,904 --> 01:38:41,939
Thanks for the pep talk,
pissant.

1638
01:38:42,973 --> 01:38:44,141
You trust me?

1639
01:38:45,042 --> 01:38:46,177
I do.

1640
01:38:47,211 --> 01:38:48,678
Your call.

1641
01:38:49,380 --> 01:38:51,148
Here we go.

1642
01:39:06,996 --> 01:39:10,900
Hey, man!
Make love, not war.

1643
01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:19,508
Clearly you weren't
actually born here, right?

1644
01:39:19,510 --> 01:39:22,043
The idea of me was.

1645
01:39:22,045 --> 01:39:23,845
Right. Well,
imagine you're S.H.I.E.L.D...

1646
01:39:23,847 --> 01:39:27,217
running a quasi-fascistic
intelligence organization...

1647
01:39:28,486 --> 01:39:30,284
where do you hide it?

1648
01:39:30,286 --> 01:39:32,021
In plain sight.

1649
01:40:00,150 --> 01:40:01,582
Good luck
on your mission, Captain.

1650
01:40:01,584 --> 01:40:04,220
Good luck
on your project, Doctor.

1651
01:40:07,557 --> 01:40:08,824
You new here?

1652
01:40:11,261 --> 01:40:12,728
Not exactly.

1653
01:40:19,301 --> 01:40:21,136
Come on, you bastard.

1654
01:40:27,976 --> 01:40:29,378
Gotcha.

1655
01:40:34,283 --> 01:40:35,284
Whew.

1656
01:40:46,794 --> 01:40:48,729
Back in the game.

1657
01:40:51,266 --> 01:40:52,434
Arnim, you in there?

1658
01:40:53,402 --> 01:40:54,436
Arnim?

1659
01:40:59,675 --> 01:41:01,675
Hey!

1660
01:41:01,677 --> 01:41:03,445
The door is this way, pal.

1661
01:41:04,313 --> 01:41:05,312
Oh, yeah.

1662
01:41:05,314 --> 01:41:07,314
Looking for Doctor Zola,
have you seen him?

1663
01:41:07,316 --> 01:41:11,052
Yeah, Doctor Zola.
No, I haven't seen a soul.

1664
01:41:12,454 --> 01:41:13,921
Pardon me.

1665
01:41:14,523 --> 01:41:16,224
Do I know you?

1666
01:41:17,426 --> 01:41:18,426
No, sir. Uh...

1667
01:41:19,794 --> 01:41:21,829
I'm a visitor from MIT.

1668
01:41:22,296 --> 01:41:23,397
Oh. MIT.

1669
01:41:23,764 --> 01:41:25,066
Got a name?

1670
01:41:25,433 --> 01:41:26,666
Howard.

1671
01:41:26,668 --> 01:41:29,270
- That'll be easy to remember.
- Howard...

1672
01:41:30,271 --> 01:41:31,737
Potts.

1673
01:41:31,739 --> 01:41:34,240
Well,
I'm Howard Stark.

1674
01:41:34,242 --> 01:41:35,107
Hi.

1675
01:41:35,109 --> 01:41:36,675
Shake that,
don't pull it.

1676
01:41:36,677 --> 01:41:37,878
Yeah.

1677
01:41:39,013 --> 01:41:41,513
You look a little green around the
gills, there, Potts.

1678
01:41:41,515 --> 01:41:43,781
I'm fine.
Just long hours.

1679
01:41:43,783 --> 01:41:45,752
You wanna get some air?

1680
01:41:47,989 --> 01:41:49,954
- Hello, Potts.
- Yeah.

1681
01:41:49,956 --> 01:41:51,490
- That'd be swell.
- That way.

1682
01:41:51,492 --> 01:41:52,591
Okay.

1683
01:41:52,593 --> 01:41:54,328
Need your briefcase?

1684
01:41:58,399 --> 01:42:01,269
You're not one of those
beatniks, are you, Potts?

1685
01:42:06,940 --> 01:42:08,707
- Hello?
<i>- Doctor Pym?</i>

1686
01:42:08,709 --> 01:42:11,242
That would be the
number that you called, yes.

1687
01:42:11,244 --> 01:42:13,746
<i>This is Captain Stevens
from shipping.</i>

1688
01:42:13,748 --> 01:42:14,912
<i>We have a package for you.</i>

1689
01:42:14,914 --> 01:42:16,615
Oh, bring it up.

1690
01:42:16,617 --> 01:42:18,785
<i>That's the thing, sir,
we can't.</i>

1691
01:42:19,687 --> 01:42:22,520
I'm confused.
I thought that was your job.

1692
01:42:22,522 --> 01:42:23,955
<i>Well, it's just...</i>

1693
01:42:23,957 --> 01:42:25,658
<i>Sir, the box is glowing...</i>

1694
01:42:25,660 --> 01:42:26,991
<i>and to be honest,</i>

1695
01:42:26,993 --> 01:42:28,626
<i>some of our mail guys
aren't feeling that great.</i>

1696
01:42:28,628 --> 01:42:30,328
They didn't open it,
did they?

1697
01:42:30,330 --> 01:42:32,866
<i>Uh, yeah, they did.
You better get down here.</i>

1698
01:42:33,533 --> 01:42:35,468
Excuse me!
Out of the way!

1699
01:43:02,429 --> 01:43:06,231
So, flowers and sauerkraut.
You got a big date tonight?

1700
01:43:06,832 --> 01:43:08,533
Uh, my wife's expecting.

1701
01:43:08,535 --> 01:43:11,403
And too much time
at the office.

1702
01:43:13,272 --> 01:43:14,504
Congratulations.

1703
01:43:14,506 --> 01:43:17,908
- Thanks. Hold this, will ya?
- Yeah, sure.

1704
01:43:17,910 --> 01:43:20,145
- How far along is she?
- Uh, I don't know.

1705
01:43:21,781 --> 01:43:22,946
She's at the point where

1706
01:43:22,948 --> 01:43:24,514
she can't stand
the sound of my chewing.

1707
01:43:24,516 --> 01:43:28,287
I guess I'll be eating
dinner in the pantry again.

1708
01:43:29,021 --> 01:43:30,354
I have a little girl.

1709
01:43:30,356 --> 01:43:31,888
A girl would be nice.

1710
01:43:31,890 --> 01:43:34,624
Less of a chance she'd
turn out exactly like me.

1711
01:43:34,626 --> 01:43:36,126
What'd be so awful
about that?

1712
01:43:36,128 --> 01:43:38,195
Let's just say
that the greater good

1713
01:43:38,197 --> 01:43:41,633
has rarely outweighed
my own self-interest.

1714
01:43:45,471 --> 01:43:47,137
And you've never seen
these two men before?

1715
01:43:47,139 --> 01:43:48,839
No, I've got an eye for this.
The two of them looked fishy.

1716
01:43:48,841 --> 01:43:49,905
Can you describe them?

1717
01:43:49,907 --> 01:43:51,208
One of them
had a hippie beard.

1718
01:43:51,210 --> 01:43:53,443
Hippie.
Like Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?

1719
01:43:53,445 --> 01:43:54,811
Definitely Mungo Jerry.

1720
01:43:54,813 --> 01:43:55,911
Yeah, this is Chesler.

1721
01:43:55,913 --> 01:43:57,079
I need every available MP
to sublevel six.

1722
01:43:57,081 --> 01:43:59,183
We have
a potential breach.

1723
01:44:16,901 --> 01:44:18,067
I said bring them in.

1724
01:44:18,069 --> 01:44:19,168
They're trying, ma'am,
but Braddock's unit

1725
01:44:19,170 --> 01:44:20,369
has been stopped
by lightning strikes.

1726
01:44:20,371 --> 01:44:21,270
Oh, for the love of...

1727
01:44:21,272 --> 01:44:23,074
I'll look at
the weather projections.

1728
01:44:46,898 --> 01:44:49,099
It's not lightning strikes
we're looking at.

1729
01:45:00,177 --> 01:45:02,076
So, where you at
with names?

1730
01:45:02,078 --> 01:45:05,313
Well, if it's a boy,
my wife likes Elmonzo.

1731
01:45:05,315 --> 01:45:07,550
Huh. Might wanna
let that stew awhile.

1732
01:45:07,552 --> 01:45:09,119
- You got time.
- Uh-huh.

1733
01:45:10,220 --> 01:45:12,822
Let me ask you
a question.

1734
01:45:12,824 --> 01:45:16,157
When your kid was born,
were you nervous?

1735
01:45:16,159 --> 01:45:17,827
Wildly.

1736
01:45:17,829 --> 01:45:19,727
- Yeah.
- Did you feel qualified?

1737
01:45:19,729 --> 01:45:21,496
Like you had any idea

1738
01:45:21,498 --> 01:45:23,531
how to successfully operate
that thing?

1739
01:45:23,533 --> 01:45:26,734
I literally pieced it
together as I went along.

1740
01:45:26,736 --> 01:45:29,103
I thought about
what my dad did.

1741
01:45:29,105 --> 01:45:30,405
My old man,

1742
01:45:30,407 --> 01:45:32,273
he never met a problem he
couldn't solve with a belt.

1743
01:45:32,275 --> 01:45:34,642
I thought my dad
was tough on me.

1744
01:45:34,644 --> 01:45:35,976
And now,
looking back on it,

1745
01:45:35,978 --> 01:45:37,345
I just remember
the good stuff.

1746
01:45:37,347 --> 01:45:39,147
You know? He did drop
the odd pearl.

1747
01:45:39,149 --> 01:45:41,549
Yeah? Like what?

1748
01:45:41,551 --> 01:45:44,354
"No amount of money ever
bought a second of time."

1749
01:45:45,622 --> 01:45:46,987
Smart guy.

1750
01:45:46,989 --> 01:45:48,558
He did his best.

1751
01:45:49,860 --> 01:45:51,325
I'll tell you,
that kid's not even here yet

1752
01:45:51,327 --> 01:45:54,029
and there's nothing
I wouldn't do for him.

1753
01:46:02,639 --> 01:46:04,139
Good to meet you, Potts.

1754
01:46:04,540 --> 01:46:05,541
Yeah.

1755
01:46:05,876 --> 01:46:07,474
Howard...

1756
01:46:07,476 --> 01:46:09,345
everything's gonna be
all right.

1757
01:46:12,348 --> 01:46:13,549
Thank you...

1758
01:46:14,517 --> 01:46:16,116
for everything...

1759
01:46:16,118 --> 01:46:18,554
you've done
for this country.

1760
01:46:21,457 --> 01:46:22,558
Jarvis.

1761
01:46:26,128 --> 01:46:27,763
Have we ever met
that guy?

1762
01:46:29,765 --> 01:46:31,367
You meet
a lot of people, sir.

1763
01:46:33,869 --> 01:46:35,571
Seems very familiar.

1764
01:46:36,505 --> 01:46:38,072
Weird beard.

1765
01:46:45,848 --> 01:46:47,349
You're weak.

1766
01:46:47,783 --> 01:46:49,050
I'm you.

1767
01:47:06,367 --> 01:47:08,869
You could stop this.

1768
01:47:08,871 --> 01:47:11,270
You know you want to.

1769
01:47:11,272 --> 01:47:13,608
Did you see what happens
in the future?

1770
01:47:14,843 --> 01:47:17,345
Thanos finds the Soul Stone.

1771
01:47:18,580 --> 01:47:20,782
You wanna know
how he does that?

1772
01:47:22,083 --> 01:47:26,421
You wanna know
what he does to you?

1773
01:47:26,821 --> 01:47:28,220
That's enough.

1774
01:47:40,568 --> 01:47:42,235
You disgust me.

1775
01:47:43,270 --> 01:47:48,375
But that doesn't mean
you're useless.

1776
01:48:09,931 --> 01:48:11,698
How do I look?

1777
01:48:18,372 --> 01:48:19,373
Wow.

1778
01:48:20,173 --> 01:48:23,408
Under different
circumstances...

1779
01:48:23,410 --> 01:48:25,612
this would be
totally awesome.

1780
01:48:37,357 --> 01:48:38,923
I bet the raccoon

1781
01:48:38,925 --> 01:48:40,525
didn't have to climb
a mountain.

1782
01:48:40,527 --> 01:48:42,527
Technically he's not
a raccoon, you know?

1783
01:48:42,529 --> 01:48:44,361
Oh, whatever.
He eats garbage.

1784
01:48:44,363 --> 01:48:45,832
Welcome.

1785
01:48:48,969 --> 01:48:50,367
Natasha.

1786
01:48:50,369 --> 01:48:51,571
Daughter of Ivan.

1787
01:48:52,839 --> 01:48:54,072
Clint.

1788
01:48:54,074 --> 01:48:56,509
Son of Edith.

1789
01:49:01,815 --> 01:49:03,882
Who are you?

1790
01:49:03,884 --> 01:49:06,583
Consider me a guide...

1791
01:49:06,585 --> 01:49:08,252
to you...

1792
01:49:08,254 --> 01:49:10,254
and to all who seek
the Soul Stone.

1793
01:49:10,256 --> 01:49:11,555
Oh, good.

1794
01:49:11,557 --> 01:49:13,726
You tell us where it is,
then we'll be on our way.

1795
01:49:17,463 --> 01:49:19,865
If only it were that easy.

1796
01:49:31,744 --> 01:49:35,715
What you seek
lies in front of you.

1797
01:49:36,916 --> 01:49:39,452
As does what you fear.

1798
01:49:44,190 --> 01:49:46,790
The stone's down there.

1799
01:49:46,792 --> 01:49:48,959
For one of you.

1800
01:49:48,961 --> 01:49:50,730
For the other...

1801
01:49:53,264 --> 01:49:55,331
In order to take
the stone...

1802
01:49:55,333 --> 01:49:58,536
you must lose
that which you love.

1803
01:49:59,839 --> 01:50:02,975
An everlasting exchange.

1804
01:50:03,976 --> 01:50:08,246
A soul for a soul.

1805
01:50:10,515 --> 01:50:13,384
How's it going?

1806
01:50:15,553 --> 01:50:17,154
Jesus.

1807
01:50:17,156 --> 01:50:18,923
Maybe he's making
this shit up.

1808
01:50:19,824 --> 01:50:21,292
No.

1809
01:50:21,960 --> 01:50:23,526
I don't think so.

1810
01:50:23,528 --> 01:50:25,864
Why? 'Cause he knows
your daddy's name?

1811
01:50:27,264 --> 01:50:28,500
I didn't.

1812
01:50:29,701 --> 01:50:32,403
Thanos left here
with the stone...

1813
01:50:32,937 --> 01:50:34,504
without his daughter.

1814
01:50:34,506 --> 01:50:36,775
That's not a coincidence.

1815
01:50:37,842 --> 01:50:39,544
Yeah.

1816
01:50:41,112 --> 01:50:43,014
Whatever it takes.

1817
01:50:47,417 --> 01:50:49,020
Whatever it takes.

1818
01:50:53,323 --> 01:50:55,423
If we don't get that stone...

1819
01:50:55,425 --> 01:50:57,361
billions of people stay dead.

1820
01:50:58,062 --> 01:50:59,396
Yeah.

1821
01:51:00,899 --> 01:51:03,400
Then I guess we both know
who it's gotta be.

1822
01:51:04,002 --> 01:51:05,335
I guess we do.

1823
01:51:13,477 --> 01:51:15,278
I'm starting to think

1824
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:18,647
we mean different
people here, Natasha.

1825
01:51:18,649 --> 01:51:20,849
For the last five years,
I've been trying to do one thing.

1826
01:51:20,851 --> 01:51:21,983
Get to right here.

1827
01:51:21,985 --> 01:51:24,319
That's all it's been about.
Bringing everybody back.

1828
01:51:24,321 --> 01:51:26,621
No, don't you get
all decent on me now.

1829
01:51:26,623 --> 01:51:29,291
What, you think
I wanna do it?

1830
01:51:29,293 --> 01:51:31,226
I'm trying to save your life,
you idiot.

1831
01:51:31,228 --> 01:51:34,428
Yeah, well, I don't
want you to. How's that?

1832
01:51:34,430 --> 01:51:36,800
Natasha, you know
what I've done.

1833
01:51:38,334 --> 01:51:40,369
You know what I've become.

1834
01:51:42,272 --> 01:51:43,437
Oh, I don't judge people

1835
01:51:43,439 --> 01:51:44,942
on their worst mistakes.

1836
01:51:49,079 --> 01:51:50,479
Maybe you should.

1837
01:51:51,181 --> 01:51:52,815
You didn't.

1838
01:51:58,754 --> 01:52:01,124
You're a pain in my ass,
you know that?

1839
01:52:12,202 --> 01:52:13,569
Okay.

1840
01:52:15,171 --> 01:52:16,772
You win.

1841
01:52:23,145 --> 01:52:24,480
Tell my family I love 'em.

1842
01:52:28,050 --> 01:52:29,415
You tell 'em yourself.

1843
01:53:02,118 --> 01:53:03,119
Damn you.

1844
01:53:10,725 --> 01:53:11,726
Wait.

1845
01:53:19,768 --> 01:53:21,636
Let me go.

1846
01:53:22,837 --> 01:53:23,838
No.

1847
01:53:25,439 --> 01:53:26,641
No. Please, no.

1848
01:53:29,945 --> 01:53:31,813
It's okay.

1849
01:53:33,848 --> 01:53:34,849
Please.

1850
01:53:36,918 --> 01:53:37,919
No!

1851
01:55:19,318 --> 01:55:20,319
Did we get 'em all?

1852
01:55:21,654 --> 01:55:23,689
Are you telling me
this actually worked?

1853
01:55:28,361 --> 01:55:29,729
Clint, where's Nat?

1854
01:55:58,723 --> 01:55:59,925
Do we know
if she had family?

1855
01:56:01,059 --> 01:56:02,326
Yeah.

1856
01:56:02,328 --> 01:56:03,329
Us.

1857
01:56:04,863 --> 01:56:05,897
What?

1858
01:56:06,798 --> 01:56:07,864
Huh?

1859
01:56:07,866 --> 01:56:08,998
- What are you doing?
- Just asked him a question.

1860
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:10,468
Yeah, no, you're acting
like she's dead.

1861
01:56:10,470 --> 01:56:11,634
Why are we acting
like she's dead?

1862
01:56:11,636 --> 01:56:12,969
We have the stones, right?

1863
01:56:12,971 --> 01:56:14,204
As long as we have
the stones...

1864
01:56:14,206 --> 01:56:16,039
Cap, we can bring her back.
Isn't that right?

1865
01:56:16,041 --> 01:56:18,374
So, stop this shit. We're the Avengers.
Get it together.

1866
01:56:18,376 --> 01:56:19,744
Can't get her back.

1867
01:56:22,547 --> 01:56:24,080
What's he...?
What?

1868
01:56:24,082 --> 01:56:25,250
It can't be undone.

1869
01:56:25,917 --> 01:56:27,685
It can't.

1870
01:56:29,888 --> 01:56:31,454
Look, I'm sorry,
no offense,

1871
01:56:31,456 --> 01:56:33,123
but you're a very
earthly being, okay?

1872
01:56:33,125 --> 01:56:34,690
And we're talking
about space magic.

1873
01:56:34,692 --> 01:56:36,825
And "can't" seems very definitive.
Don't you think?

1874
01:56:36,827 --> 01:56:38,394
Yeah, look, I know
that I'm way outside

1875
01:56:38,396 --> 01:56:39,862
my pay grade here.

1876
01:56:39,864 --> 01:56:41,531
But she still
isn't here, is she?

1877
01:56:41,533 --> 01:56:42,664
No, that's my point.

1878
01:56:42,666 --> 01:56:45,767
It can't be undone.

1879
01:56:45,769 --> 01:56:47,170
Or that's at least

1880
01:56:47,172 --> 01:56:49,172
what the red,
floating guy had to say.

1881
01:56:49,174 --> 01:56:50,873
Maybe you wanna go
talk to him, okay?

1882
01:56:50,875 --> 01:56:54,111
Go grab your hammer and you
go fly and you talk to him.

1883
01:57:02,554 --> 01:57:04,788
It was supposed to be me.

1884
01:57:06,790 --> 01:57:09,358
She sacrificed her life
for that goddamn stone.

1885
01:57:09,360 --> 01:57:10,928
She bet her life on it.

1886
01:57:15,666 --> 01:57:18,135
She's not coming back.

1887
01:57:19,770 --> 01:57:21,338
We have to make it
worth it.

1888
01:57:22,006 --> 01:57:23,374
We have to.

1889
01:57:24,707 --> 01:57:26,443
We will.

1890
01:57:51,201 --> 01:57:52,303
Boom!

1891
01:57:57,840 --> 01:58:00,041
All right,
the glove's ready.

1892
01:58:00,043 --> 01:58:02,843
Question is, who's gonna
snap their freakin' fingers?

1893
01:58:02,845 --> 01:58:05,213
- I'll do it.
- Excuse me?

1894
01:58:05,215 --> 01:58:06,113
It's okay.

1895
01:58:06,115 --> 01:58:07,381
Stop, stop.
Slow down.

1896
01:58:07,383 --> 01:58:08,916
Thor. Just wait.

1897
01:58:08,918 --> 01:58:11,085
We haven't decided
who's gonna put that on yet.

1898
01:58:11,087 --> 01:58:12,820
I'm sorry. What, we're all
just sitting around

1899
01:58:12,822 --> 01:58:14,155
waiting for
the right opportunity?

1900
01:58:14,157 --> 01:58:15,590
We should at least
discuss it.

1901
01:58:15,592 --> 01:58:17,625
Look, sitting here
staring at the thing

1902
01:58:17,627 --> 01:58:19,462
is not gonna bring
everybody back.

1903
01:58:20,496 --> 01:58:21,963
I'm the strongest Avenger,
okay?

1904
01:58:21,965 --> 01:58:23,564
So, this responsibility
falls upon me.

1905
01:58:23,566 --> 01:58:24,864
- Normally, you're right.
- It's my duty.

1906
01:58:24,866 --> 01:58:26,833
- It's not about that.
- It's not that.

1907
01:58:26,835 --> 01:58:28,870
- Hey, buddy...
- Stop it! Just let me.

1908
01:58:31,674 --> 01:58:33,207
Just let me do it.

1909
01:58:33,209 --> 01:58:35,942
Just let me do something good.
Something right.

1910
01:58:35,944 --> 01:58:37,144
Look, it's not
just the fact...

1911
01:58:37,146 --> 01:58:38,446
that that glove is channeling
enough energy

1912
01:58:38,448 --> 01:58:39,380
to light up a continent.

1913
01:58:39,382 --> 01:58:41,449
I'm telling you.
You're in no condition.

1914
01:58:41,451 --> 01:58:44,818
What do you think is coursing
through my veins right now?

1915
01:58:44,820 --> 01:58:46,054
Cheez Whiz?

1916
01:58:48,491 --> 01:58:49,624
Lightning.

1917
01:58:49,626 --> 01:58:50,857
Yeah.
Lightning.

1918
01:58:50,859 --> 01:58:52,493
Lightning won't help you, pal.

1919
01:58:52,495 --> 01:58:54,363
It's gotta be me.

1920
01:58:55,632 --> 01:58:57,897
You saw what those
stones did to Thanos.

1921
01:58:57,899 --> 01:58:59,535
They almost killed him.

1922
01:59:00,869 --> 01:59:03,536
None of you could survive.

1923
01:59:03,538 --> 01:59:05,372
How do we know
you will?

1924
01:59:05,374 --> 01:59:06,641
We don't.

1925
01:59:06,643 --> 01:59:09,278
But the radiation's
mostly gamma.

1926
01:59:12,681 --> 01:59:14,349
It's like...

1927
01:59:16,251 --> 01:59:18,186
I was made for this.

1928
01:59:36,937 --> 01:59:38,540
Good to go, yeah?

1929
01:59:40,642 --> 01:59:41,775
Let's do it.

1930
01:59:41,777 --> 01:59:43,142
Okay, remember,

1931
01:59:43,144 --> 01:59:44,943
everyone Thanos snapped away
five years ago...

1932
01:59:44,945 --> 01:59:47,447
you're just bringing them
back to now, today.

1933
01:59:47,449 --> 01:59:49,289
Don't change anything
from the last five years.

1934
01:59:50,519 --> 01:59:51,852
Got it.

1935
02:00:07,968 --> 02:00:09,268
<i>Friday, do me a favor</i>

1936
02:00:09,270 --> 02:00:10,936
<i>and activate Barn Door
Protocol, will ya?</i>

1937
02:00:10,938 --> 02:00:12,373
<i>Yes, boss.</i>

1938
02:00:20,847 --> 02:00:22,916
Everybody comes home.

1939
02:00:46,039 --> 02:00:47,706
Take it off! Take it off!

1940
02:00:47,708 --> 02:00:49,140
No, wait.
Bruce, are you okay?

1941
02:00:49,142 --> 02:00:51,311
<i>Talk to me, Banner.</i>

1942
02:00:54,447 --> 02:00:55,448
I'm okay.

1943
02:00:55,850 --> 02:00:57,283
I'm okay.

1944
02:01:28,648 --> 02:01:29,948
Bruce!

1945
02:01:31,551 --> 02:01:33,218
Don't move him.

1946
02:01:39,958 --> 02:01:42,127
- Did it work?
- We're not sure. It's okay.

1947
02:02:28,540 --> 02:02:29,573
Honey.

1948
02:02:29,575 --> 02:02:30,674
<i>Clint?</i>

1949
02:02:30,676 --> 02:02:32,076
Honey.

1950
02:02:32,744 --> 02:02:34,212
Guys...

1951
02:02:36,582 --> 02:02:38,082
I think it worked.

1952
02:03:20,424 --> 02:03:22,358
I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!

1953
02:03:23,694 --> 02:03:25,530
Canopy, canopy, canopy.

1954
02:03:32,035 --> 02:03:34,070
Rhodey, Rocket,
get out of here.

1955
02:03:35,006 --> 02:03:36,641
Let me up! Let me up!

1956
02:03:37,440 --> 02:03:38,440
Come on!

1957
02:03:48,351 --> 02:03:49,351
Rhodey!

1958
02:03:50,855 --> 02:03:52,155
Huh?

1959
02:03:57,460 --> 02:03:59,294
<i>Mayday, Mayday!
Does anybody copy?</i>

1960
02:03:59,296 --> 02:04:00,828
<i>We're on the lower level.
It's flooding!</i>

1961
02:04:00,830 --> 02:04:02,530
What? What?

1962
02:04:02,532 --> 02:04:05,000
<i>We are drowning!
Does anybody copy? Mayday!</i>

1963
02:04:05,002 --> 02:04:07,268
Wait! I'm here!

1964
02:04:07,270 --> 02:04:09,072
I'm here. Can you hear me?

1965
02:04:28,592 --> 02:04:29,759
Cap?

1966
02:04:53,749 --> 02:04:54,850
Okay.

1967
02:05:14,069 --> 02:05:15,502
Daughter.

1968
02:05:15,504 --> 02:05:16,639
Yes, Father.

1969
02:05:18,340 --> 02:05:20,308
So, this is the future.

1970
02:05:20,843 --> 02:05:21,843
Well done.

1971
02:05:22,645 --> 02:05:24,176
Thank you, Father.

1972
02:05:24,178 --> 02:05:25,681
They suspected nothing.

1973
02:05:27,950 --> 02:05:29,518
The arrogant never do.

1974
02:05:32,487 --> 02:05:34,387
Go.

1975
02:05:34,389 --> 02:05:37,024
Find the stones,
bring them to me.

1976
02:05:37,026 --> 02:05:38,794
What will you do?

1977
02:05:40,062 --> 02:05:41,797
Wait.

1978
02:06:06,988 --> 02:06:08,723
Tell me something.

1979
02:06:09,824 --> 02:06:12,291
In the future...

1980
02:06:12,293 --> 02:06:14,395
what happens
to you and me?

1981
02:06:16,631 --> 02:06:18,331
I try to kill you.

1982
02:06:19,901 --> 02:06:21,502
Several times.

1983
02:06:22,369 --> 02:06:24,670
But eventually...

1984
02:06:24,672 --> 02:06:26,641
we become friends.

1985
02:06:28,042 --> 02:06:29,811
We become sisters.

1986
02:06:37,350 --> 02:06:38,719
Come on.

1987
02:06:40,754 --> 02:06:42,589
We can stop him.

1988
02:06:50,464 --> 02:06:51,997
Come on, buddy,
wake up!

1989
02:06:51,999 --> 02:06:54,666
That's my man.

1990
02:06:54,668 --> 02:06:56,903
You lose this again,
I'm keeping it.

1991
02:07:00,340 --> 02:07:01,606
What happened?

1992
02:07:01,608 --> 02:07:04,042
You mess with time,
it tends to mess back.

1993
02:07:04,044 --> 02:07:05,044
You'll see.

1994
02:07:27,033 --> 02:07:28,534
What's he been doing?

1995
02:07:30,269 --> 02:07:31,805
Absolutely nothing.

1996
02:07:33,405 --> 02:07:35,606
Where are the stones?

1997
02:07:35,608 --> 02:07:37,676
Somewhere under all this.

1998
02:07:38,979 --> 02:07:41,278
All I know is
he doesn't have 'em.

1999
02:07:41,280 --> 02:07:43,214
So, we keep it that way.

2000
02:07:43,216 --> 02:07:44,848
You know
it's a trap, right?

2001
02:07:44,850 --> 02:07:46,251
Yeah.

2002
02:07:46,253 --> 02:07:47,720
I don't much care.

2003
02:07:48,521 --> 02:07:50,287
Good.

2004
02:07:50,289 --> 02:07:52,956
Just as long
as we're all in agreement.

2005
02:08:02,501 --> 02:08:04,703
Let's kill him
properly this time.

2006
02:08:13,813 --> 02:08:16,949
You could not live
with your own failure.

2007
02:08:18,349 --> 02:08:20,418
Where did that bring you?

2008
02:08:23,189 --> 02:08:25,090
Back to me.

2009
02:08:28,426 --> 02:08:32,095
I thought by eliminating
half of life...

2010
02:08:32,097 --> 02:08:34,530
the other half
would thrive.

2011
02:08:34,532 --> 02:08:36,001
But you've shown me...

2012
02:08:37,136 --> 02:08:38,938
that's impossible.

2013
02:08:40,672 --> 02:08:44,241
And as long as there are those
that remember what was...

2014
02:08:44,243 --> 02:08:45,708
there will always be those

2015
02:08:45,710 --> 02:08:49,614
that are unable to accept
what can be.

2016
02:08:50,216 --> 02:08:51,814
They will resist.

2017
02:08:51,816 --> 02:08:53,952
Yep, we're all kinds
of stubborn.

2018
02:08:54,886 --> 02:08:56,554
I'm thankful.

2019
02:08:58,489 --> 02:09:00,423
Because now...

2020
02:09:00,425 --> 02:09:03,092
I know what I must do.

2021
02:09:03,094 --> 02:09:06,195
I will shred
this universe...

2022
02:09:06,197 --> 02:09:08,433
down to its last atom.

2023
02:09:09,067 --> 02:09:10,733
And then...

2024
02:09:10,735 --> 02:09:13,403
with the stones
you've collected for me...

2025
02:09:14,038 --> 02:09:16,272
create a new one...

2026
02:09:16,274 --> 02:09:18,573
teeming with life...

2027
02:09:18,575 --> 02:09:20,609
that knows not
what it has lost...

2028
02:09:20,611 --> 02:09:23,114
but only
what it has been given.

2029
02:09:26,184 --> 02:09:27,718
A grateful universe.

2030
02:09:28,152 --> 02:09:29,618
Born out of blood.

2031
02:09:29,620 --> 02:09:31,555
They'll never know it.

2032
02:09:32,522 --> 02:09:35,659
Because you won't be alive
to tell them.

2033
02:09:50,140 --> 02:09:51,439
See you
on the other side, man.

2034
02:09:53,644 --> 02:09:55,846
Hang on!
I'm coming!

2035
02:10:26,076 --> 02:10:27,077
Yeah!

2036
02:10:41,991 --> 02:10:43,557
Oh, hey.

2037
02:10:43,559 --> 02:10:45,528
I know you.

2038
02:10:48,265 --> 02:10:49,465
Father...

2039
02:10:50,066 --> 02:10:51,732
I have the stones.

2040
02:10:51,734 --> 02:10:52,734
What?

2041
02:10:53,970 --> 02:10:54,970
Stop.

2042
02:11:00,076 --> 02:11:01,610
You're betraying us?

2043
02:11:07,416 --> 02:11:08,851
You don't have to do this.

2044
02:11:11,519 --> 02:11:14,254
I am this.

2045
02:11:14,256 --> 02:11:16,556
No, you're not.

2046
02:11:16,558 --> 02:11:18,660
You've seen what we become.

2047
02:11:24,532 --> 02:11:26,901
Nebula, listen to her.

2048
02:11:28,270 --> 02:11:29,270
You can change.

2049
02:11:35,910 --> 02:11:37,512
He won't let me.

2050
02:11:39,014 --> 02:11:40,014
No!

2051
02:11:59,334 --> 02:12:00,835
Okay, Thor. Hit me.

2052
02:12:17,352 --> 02:12:18,786
<i>Boss, wake up!</i>

2053
02:13:10,037 --> 02:13:11,271
I knew it!

2054
02:14:33,586 --> 02:14:36,455
In all my years
of conquest...

2055
02:14:37,689 --> 02:14:39,691
violence...

2056
02:14:40,526 --> 02:14:42,694
slaughter...

2057
02:14:43,596 --> 02:14:46,131
it was never personal.

2058
02:14:48,601 --> 02:14:50,869
But I'll tell you now...

2059
02:14:52,672 --> 02:14:56,573
what I'm about to do
to your stubborn,

2060
02:14:56,575 --> 02:14:59,077
annoying little planet...

2061
02:15:00,679 --> 02:15:03,048
I'm gonna enjoy it...

2062
02:15:03,781 --> 02:15:06,451
very, very much.

2063
02:16:09,680 --> 02:16:11,315
<i>Hey, Cap, you read me?</i>

2064
02:16:17,120 --> 02:16:19,556
<i>Cap, it's Sam.
Can you hear me?</i>

2065
02:16:23,560 --> 02:16:25,094
<i>On your left.</i>

2066
02:17:50,645 --> 02:17:52,011
Is that everyone?

2067
02:17:52,013 --> 02:17:54,383
What? You wanted more?

2068
02:18:20,809 --> 02:18:22,977
Avengers...

2069
02:18:27,883 --> 02:18:29,014
assemble.

2070
02:19:04,318 --> 02:19:05,519
Die!

2071
02:19:26,039 --> 02:19:29,042
No, no, give me that.
You have the little one.

2072
02:19:42,589 --> 02:19:43,589
Hey!

2073
02:19:44,457 --> 02:19:45,389
Holy cow!

2074
02:19:45,391 --> 02:19:46,959
You will not believe
what's been going on.

2075
02:19:46,961 --> 02:19:48,459
Do you remember
when we were in space?

2076
02:19:48,461 --> 02:19:49,894
And I got all dusty?

2077
02:19:49,896 --> 02:19:51,028
And I must've passed out,

2078
02:19:51,030 --> 02:19:52,563
because I woke up
and you were gone.

2079
02:19:52,565 --> 02:19:54,398
But Doctor Strange was there,
right? And he was like...

2080
02:19:54,400 --> 02:19:56,133
"It's been five years.
Come on, they need us."

2081
02:19:56,135 --> 02:19:57,668
And then he started doing
the yellow sparkly thing

2082
02:19:57,670 --> 02:19:59,002
- that he does all the time.
- He did? Oh, no.

2083
02:19:59,004 --> 02:20:01,474
- What are you doing?
- Oh.

2084
02:20:05,478 --> 02:20:07,079
Oh, this is nice.

2085
02:20:28,701 --> 02:20:29,702
Gamora?

2086
02:20:39,044 --> 02:20:40,779
I thought I lost you.

2087
02:20:44,316 --> 02:20:45,248
Ow.

2088
02:20:45,250 --> 02:20:48,387
Don't touch me!

2089
02:20:51,189 --> 02:20:53,189
You missed the first time.

2090
02:20:53,191 --> 02:20:55,394
Then you got 'em both
the second time.

2091
02:20:57,195 --> 02:20:58,595
This is the one?

2092
02:20:58,597 --> 02:20:59,729
Seriously?

2093
02:20:59,731 --> 02:21:01,965
Your choices were him
or a tree.

2094
02:21:12,578 --> 02:21:13,643
Cap!

2095
02:21:13,645 --> 02:21:15,514
What do you want me to do
with this damn thing?

2096
02:21:18,082 --> 02:21:20,249
Get those stones
as far away as possible!

2097
02:21:20,251 --> 02:21:21,485
No!

2098
02:21:22,420 --> 02:21:24,721
We need to get 'em back
where they came from.

2099
02:21:24,723 --> 02:21:25,588
No way to get 'em back.

2100
02:21:25,590 --> 02:21:27,523
Thanos destroyed
the quantum tunnel.

2101
02:21:27,525 --> 02:21:28,525
Hold on!

2102
02:21:30,094 --> 02:21:32,261
That wasn't
our only time machine.

2103
02:21:38,202 --> 02:21:40,569
Anyone see an ugly brown van
out there?

2104
02:21:40,571 --> 02:21:43,772
Yes! But you're not gonna like
where it's parked!

2105
02:21:43,774 --> 02:21:46,277
Scott, how long you need
to get that thing working?

2106
02:21:47,244 --> 02:21:48,510
Uh, maybe 10 minutes.

2107
02:21:48,512 --> 02:21:50,245
Get it started.
We'll get the stones to you.

2108
02:21:50,247 --> 02:21:51,882
We're on it, Cap.

2109
02:22:01,692 --> 02:22:02,725
Hey.

2110
02:22:02,727 --> 02:22:06,129
You said one out of
14 million, we win, yeah?

2111
02:22:06,864 --> 02:22:08,196
Tell me this is it.

2112
02:22:08,198 --> 02:22:10,231
If I tell you what happens...

2113
02:22:10,233 --> 02:22:11,569
it won't happen.

2114
02:22:15,039 --> 02:22:16,239
You better be right.

2115
02:22:24,381 --> 02:22:25,883
It's a mess back here.

2116
02:22:26,884 --> 02:22:27,885
It's dead.

2117
02:22:29,120 --> 02:22:30,853
- What?
- It's dead.

2118
02:22:30,855 --> 02:22:32,389
I have to hot-wire it.

2119
02:22:35,258 --> 02:22:36,626
Where's Nebula?

2120
02:22:37,727 --> 02:22:39,195
She's not responding.

2121
02:22:39,496 --> 02:22:40,764
Sire...

2122
02:22:50,373 --> 02:22:51,775
Clint!

2123
02:22:53,810 --> 02:22:54,911
Give it to me.

2124
02:23:17,133 --> 02:23:20,935
You took everything from me.

2125
02:23:20,937 --> 02:23:23,537
I don't even know
who you are.

2126
02:23:23,539 --> 02:23:25,240
You will.

2127
02:23:47,396 --> 02:23:48,564
I got it!

2128
02:23:50,999 --> 02:23:52,266
Activate Instant Kill.

2129
02:24:15,623 --> 02:24:16,892
Rain fire!

2130
02:24:17,458 --> 02:24:19,725
But, sire, our troops!

2131
02:24:19,727 --> 02:24:21,529
Just do it!

2132
02:24:41,449 --> 02:24:43,951
<i>Uh, is anyone else
seeing this?</i>

2133
02:24:57,899 --> 02:24:58,998
I got this!

2134
02:24:59,000 --> 02:25:01,299
I got this.
Okay, I don't got this.

2135
02:25:01,301 --> 02:25:02,567
<i>Help, somebody help!</i>

2136
02:25:02,569 --> 02:25:04,672
Hey, Queens, heads up!

2137
02:25:14,514 --> 02:25:15,749
Hang on. I got you, kid.

2138
02:25:19,253 --> 02:25:20,718
Hey!
Nice to meet you...

2139
02:25:20,720 --> 02:25:22,589
Oh, my God!

2140
02:25:58,592 --> 02:26:00,792
What the hell is this?

2141
02:26:00,794 --> 02:26:02,260
Friday,
what are they firing at?

2142
02:26:02,262 --> 02:26:04,302
<i>Something just
entered the upper atmosphere.</i>

2143
02:26:17,310 --> 02:26:19,645
Oh, yeah!

2144
02:26:39,366 --> 02:26:41,901
Danvers,
we need an assist here.

2145
02:26:50,508 --> 02:26:53,178
Hi, I'm Peter Parker.

2146
02:26:53,879 --> 02:26:55,345
Hey, Peter Parker.

2147
02:26:55,347 --> 02:26:56,747
You got something for me?

2148
02:27:02,587 --> 02:27:04,857
I don't know how you're gonna
get it through all of that.

2149
02:27:06,392 --> 02:27:07,927
Don't worry.

2150
02:27:08,826 --> 02:27:10,495
She's got help.

2151
02:29:58,160 --> 02:30:01,763
I am inevitable.

2152
02:30:21,883 --> 02:30:23,383
And I...

2153
02:30:25,053 --> 02:30:26,187
am...

2154
02:30:29,958 --> 02:30:31,359
Iron Man.

2155
02:32:29,942 --> 02:32:32,243
Mr. Stark?

2156
02:32:32,245 --> 02:32:34,445
Hey!

2157
02:32:34,447 --> 02:32:37,548
Mr. Stark.
Can you hear me?

2158
02:32:37,550 --> 02:32:39,185
It's Peter.

2159
02:32:40,419 --> 02:32:42,121
Hey.

2160
02:32:42,955 --> 02:32:46,192
We won, Mr. Stark.

2161
02:32:47,859 --> 02:32:50,196
We won, Mr. Stark.

2162
02:32:51,697 --> 02:32:54,931
We won! You did it, sir,
you did it.

2163
02:32:54,933 --> 02:32:57,066
I'm sorry.

2164
02:32:57,068 --> 02:32:58,069
Tony.

2165
02:33:11,617 --> 02:33:12,782
Hey.

2166
02:33:12,784 --> 02:33:14,853
Hey, Pep.

2167
02:33:19,090 --> 02:33:20,089
Friday?

2168
02:33:20,091 --> 02:33:23,094
<i>Life functions critical.</i>

2169
02:33:31,569 --> 02:33:32,570
Tony?

2170
02:33:33,773 --> 02:33:35,040
Look at me.

2171
02:33:37,575 --> 02:33:39,511
We're gonna be okay.

2172
02:33:44,282 --> 02:33:46,184
You can rest now.

2173
02:35:31,421 --> 02:35:34,388
<i>Everybody wants
a happy ending, right?</i>

2174
02:35:34,390 --> 02:35:36,958
<i>But it doesn't always
roll that way.</i>

2175
02:35:38,828 --> 02:35:40,563
<i>Maybe this time.</i>

2176
02:35:42,030 --> 02:35:44,966
<i>I'm hoping
if you play this back...</i>

2177
02:35:46,502 --> 02:35:48,769
<i>it's in celebration.</i>

2178
02:35:48,771 --> 02:35:52,840
<i>I hope families are reunited.
I hope we get it back.</i>

2179
02:35:52,842 --> 02:35:54,375
<i>And something like
a normal version</i>

2180
02:35:54,377 --> 02:35:56,911
<i>of the planet
has been restored.</i>

2181
02:35:56,913 --> 02:35:59,345
<i>If there ever was
such a thing.</i>

2182
02:35:59,347 --> 02:36:03,316
<i>God, what a world.
Universe, now.</i>

2183
02:36:03,318 --> 02:36:05,452
<i>If you told me 10 years ago
that we weren't alone...</i>

2184
02:36:05,454 --> 02:36:07,521
<i>let alone to this extent,
I mean,</i>

2185
02:36:07,523 --> 02:36:09,522
<i>I wouldn't have
been surprised...</i>

2186
02:36:09,524 --> 02:36:11,191
<i>but come on, who knew?</i>

2187
02:36:11,193 --> 02:36:14,060
<i>The epic forces of
darkness and light</i>

2188
02:36:14,062 --> 02:36:15,995
<i>that have come into play.</i>

2189
02:36:15,997 --> 02:36:17,898
<i>And for better or worse...</i>

2190
02:36:17,900 --> 02:36:19,499
<i>that's the reality
Morgan's gonna</i>

2191
02:36:19,501 --> 02:36:22,302
<i>have to find a way
to grow up in.</i>

2192
02:36:25,140 --> 02:36:26,239
<i>So, I thought I'd probably</i>

2193
02:36:26,241 --> 02:36:27,607
<i>better record
a little greeting...</i>

2194
02:36:27,609 --> 02:36:31,044
<i>in the case of an untimely death.
On my part.</i>

2195
02:36:31,046 --> 02:36:34,449
<i>Not that death at any time
isn't untimely.</i>

2196
02:36:35,417 --> 02:36:36,950
<i>This time travel thing
that we're gonna</i>

2197
02:36:36,952 --> 02:36:38,785
<i>try and pull off tomorrow...</i>

2198
02:36:38,787 --> 02:36:39,853
<i>it's got me
scratching my head</i>

2199
02:36:39,855 --> 02:36:41,086
<i>about the survivability
of it all.</i>

2200
02:36:41,088 --> 02:36:42,657
<i>That's the thing.</i>

2201
02:36:44,459 --> 02:36:46,493
<i>Then again,
that's the hero gig, right?</i>

2202
02:36:46,495 --> 02:36:47,762
<i>Part of the journey
is the end.</i>

2203
02:36:49,764 --> 02:36:50,897
<i>What am I even tripping for?</i>

2204
02:36:50,899 --> 02:36:52,030
<i>Everything is gonna work out</i>

2205
02:36:52,032 --> 02:36:55,169
<i>exactly the way
it's supposed to.</i>

2206
02:36:58,573 --> 02:37:00,307
<i>I love you 3,000.</i>

2207
02:39:15,074 --> 02:39:17,707
You know,
I wish there was a way

2208
02:39:17,709 --> 02:39:18,877
that I could let her know.

2209
02:39:21,480 --> 02:39:23,582
That we won.

2210
02:39:24,883 --> 02:39:26,652
We did it.

2211
02:39:30,122 --> 02:39:32,156
She knows.

2212
02:39:36,862 --> 02:39:38,930
They both do.

2213
02:39:47,906 --> 02:39:49,105
<i>How you doing, squirt?</i>

2214
02:39:49,107 --> 02:39:50,239
Good.

2215
02:39:50,241 --> 02:39:51,641
- You good?
- Mm-hmm.

2216
02:39:51,643 --> 02:39:54,944
- Good. You hungry?
- Mm-hmm.

2217
02:39:54,946 --> 02:39:55,947
What do you want?

2218
02:39:56,715 --> 02:39:58,249
Cheeseburgers.

2219
02:40:02,687 --> 02:40:05,421
You know, your dad
liked cheeseburgers.

2220
02:40:05,423 --> 02:40:06,757
Okay.

2221
02:40:09,226 --> 02:40:10,359
I'm gonna get you

2222
02:40:10,361 --> 02:40:11,760
all the cheeseburgers
you want.

2223
02:40:11,762 --> 02:40:12,763
Okay.

2224
02:40:29,580 --> 02:40:31,113
So...

2225
02:40:31,115 --> 02:40:33,716
when can we
expect you back?

2226
02:40:34,919 --> 02:40:36,985
Um, about that...

2227
02:40:36,987 --> 02:40:39,253
Thor, your people
need a king.

2228
02:40:39,255 --> 02:40:41,357
No, they already have one.

2229
02:40:43,259 --> 02:40:44,461
That's funny.

2230
02:40:49,934 --> 02:40:51,802
Are you being serious?

2231
02:40:55,338 --> 02:40:58,207
It's time for me
to be who I am...

2232
02:40:58,209 --> 02:41:00,878
rather than
who I'm supposed to be.

2233
02:41:02,113 --> 02:41:04,412
But you, you're a leader.

2234
02:41:04,414 --> 02:41:06,382
That's who you are.

2235
02:41:08,585 --> 02:41:10,685
You know, I'd make
a lot of changes around here.

2236
02:41:10,687 --> 02:41:12,620
I'm counting on it...

2237
02:41:12,622 --> 02:41:14,023
Your Majesty.

2238
02:41:24,134 --> 02:41:25,502
What will you do?

2239
02:41:26,102 --> 02:41:27,568
I'm not sure.

2240
02:41:27,570 --> 02:41:29,871
For the first time
in a thousand years,

2241
02:41:29,873 --> 02:41:31,339
I have no path.

2242
02:41:31,341 --> 02:41:33,007
I do have a ride though.

2243
02:41:33,009 --> 02:41:35,042
Move it or lose it,
hairbag.

2244
02:41:39,381 --> 02:41:41,381
Oh, here we are!

2245
02:41:41,383 --> 02:41:43,019
Tree, good to see you.

2246
02:41:47,489 --> 02:41:51,259
The Asgardians of the Galaxy
back together again.

2247
02:41:51,261 --> 02:41:53,362
Where to first?

2248
02:41:54,264 --> 02:41:55,797
Hey.

2249
02:41:55,799 --> 02:41:58,099
Just so you know,
this is my ship still.

2250
02:41:58,101 --> 02:41:59,533
I'm in charge.

2251
02:41:59,535 --> 02:42:02,302
I know. I know.
Of course you are.

2252
02:42:02,304 --> 02:42:04,005
Of course.

2253
02:42:06,441 --> 02:42:09,210
See, you say, "Of course,"
but then you touch the map.

2254
02:42:09,212 --> 02:42:10,310
It makes you think
that maybe

2255
02:42:10,312 --> 02:42:12,312
you didn't realize
I was in charge.

2256
02:42:12,314 --> 02:42:13,914
Quail, that's your own
insecurities in there.

2257
02:42:13,916 --> 02:42:15,048
Quail?

2258
02:42:15,050 --> 02:42:16,184
Okay? I am merely trying

2259
02:42:16,186 --> 02:42:17,584
to be of service
and assisting.

2260
02:42:17,586 --> 02:42:18,885
Quill.

2261
02:42:18,887 --> 02:42:20,020
That's what I said.

2262
02:42:20,022 --> 02:42:22,355
You should fight one another
for the honor of leadership.

2263
02:42:22,357 --> 02:42:23,859
Sounds fair.

2264
02:42:26,461 --> 02:42:29,095
- It's not necessary, okay?
- It's not.

2265
02:42:29,097 --> 02:42:30,163
I got some blasters,

2266
02:42:30,165 --> 02:42:31,531
unless you guys
wanna use knives.

2267
02:42:31,533 --> 02:42:34,034
Oh, yes!
Please, use knives.

2268
02:42:34,036 --> 02:42:35,235
Yeah. Knives.

2269
02:42:35,237 --> 02:42:36,872
I am Groot.

2270
02:42:42,678 --> 02:42:43,910
Not necessary.

2271
02:42:43,912 --> 02:42:45,611
There shall be
no knifing one another.

2272
02:42:45,613 --> 02:42:48,817
Everybody knows
who's in charge.

2273
02:42:52,287 --> 02:42:53,654
Me.

2274
02:42:54,722 --> 02:42:55,722
Right?

2275
02:42:56,325 --> 02:42:58,891
Yes, you.

2276
02:42:58,893 --> 02:43:01,360
Of course! Of course.

2277
02:43:01,362 --> 02:43:03,098
Of course.

2278
02:43:04,899 --> 02:43:07,200
Remember...

2279
02:43:07,202 --> 02:43:08,434
you have to return the stones

2280
02:43:08,436 --> 02:43:09,568
to the exact moment
you got 'em...

2281
02:43:09,570 --> 02:43:10,636
or you're gonna open up

2282
02:43:10,638 --> 02:43:13,072
a bunch of nasty
alternative realities.

2283
02:43:13,074 --> 02:43:14,506
Don't worry, Bruce.

2284
02:43:14,508 --> 02:43:17,042
Clip all the branches.

2285
02:43:17,044 --> 02:43:18,846
You know, I tried.

2286
02:43:19,881 --> 02:43:22,147
When I had the gauntlet,
the stones,

2287
02:43:22,149 --> 02:43:24,452
I really tried
to bring her back.

2288
02:43:27,488 --> 02:43:29,389
I miss her, man.

2289
02:43:29,690 --> 02:43:30,691
Me too.

2290
02:43:34,562 --> 02:43:37,098
You know, if you want,
I could come with you.

2291
02:43:39,566 --> 02:43:41,566
You're a good man, Sam.

2292
02:43:41,568 --> 02:43:43,403
This one's on me, though.

2293
02:43:47,574 --> 02:43:49,709
Don't do anything stupid
till I get back.

2294
02:43:51,379 --> 02:43:52,710
How can I?

2295
02:43:52,712 --> 02:43:54,748
You're taking
all the stupid with you.

2296
02:44:02,223 --> 02:44:04,356
Gonna miss you, buddy.

2297
02:44:04,358 --> 02:44:05,959
It's gonna be okay, Buck.

2298
02:44:13,267 --> 02:44:15,099
How long
is this gonna take?

2299
02:44:15,101 --> 02:44:18,104
For him, as long as he needs.
For us, five seconds.

2300
02:44:23,176 --> 02:44:24,509
You ready, Cap?

2301
02:44:24,511 --> 02:44:27,047
All right, we'll meet you
back here, okay?

2302
02:44:27,781 --> 02:44:28,882
You bet.

2303
02:44:30,283 --> 02:44:31,952
Going quantum.
Three...

2304
02:44:32,419 --> 02:44:33,485
two...

2305
02:44:34,020 --> 02:44:35,188
one.

2306
02:44:37,090 --> 02:44:39,257
And returning in five...

2307
02:44:39,259 --> 02:44:40,358
four...

2308
02:44:40,360 --> 02:44:42,360
three, two...

2309
02:44:42,362 --> 02:44:43,830
one.

2310
02:44:51,037 --> 02:44:52,003
Where is he?

2311
02:44:52,005 --> 02:44:54,105
I don't know. He blew
right by his time stamp.

2312
02:44:54,107 --> 02:44:55,674
He should be here.

2313
02:45:01,080 --> 02:45:02,180
Get him back.

2314
02:45:02,182 --> 02:45:03,381
- I'm trying.
- Get him the hell back.

2315
02:45:03,383 --> 02:45:05,452
- Hey, I said I'm trying.
- Sam.

2316
02:45:29,274 --> 02:45:30,943
Go ahead.

2317
02:45:48,926 --> 02:45:49,926
Cap?

2318
02:45:51,996 --> 02:45:53,798
Hi, Sam.

2319
02:45:56,601 --> 02:45:59,837
So, did something go wrong
or did something go right?

2320
02:46:01,739 --> 02:46:05,810
Well, after I put the stones
back, I thought...

2321
02:46:06,911 --> 02:46:08,577
maybe...

2322
02:46:08,579 --> 02:46:13,618
I'll try some of that life
Tony was telling me to get.

2323
02:46:15,420 --> 02:46:17,722
How'd that work out
for ya?

2324
02:46:20,124 --> 02:46:21,659
It was beautiful.

2325
02:46:22,727 --> 02:46:24,827
Good. I'm happy for you.

2326
02:46:24,829 --> 02:46:25,863
Truly.

2327
02:46:26,464 --> 02:46:27,899
Thank you.

2328
02:46:28,966 --> 02:46:30,499
Only thing
bumming me out...

2329
02:46:30,501 --> 02:46:32,234
is the fact I have
to live in a world

2330
02:46:32,236 --> 02:46:34,172
without Captain America.

2331
02:46:34,638 --> 02:46:35,973
Oh.

2332
02:46:38,009 --> 02:46:40,844
That reminds me.

2333
02:46:49,253 --> 02:46:50,620
Try it on.

2334
02:47:16,046 --> 02:47:17,647
How does it feel?

2335
02:47:19,916 --> 02:47:21,885
Like it's someone else's.

2336
02:47:24,921 --> 02:47:26,056
It isn't.

2337
02:47:39,336 --> 02:47:41,004
Thank you.

2338
02:47:42,572 --> 02:47:44,006
I'll do my best.

2339
02:47:49,312 --> 02:47:51,248
That's why it's yours.

2340
02:47:52,848 --> 02:47:54,317
You wanna tell me
about her?

2341
02:48:00,990 --> 02:48:02,723
No.

2342
02:48:02,725 --> 02:48:05,027
No, I don't think I will.
