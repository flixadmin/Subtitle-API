how was it yesterday, seeing Reggie?

Not really an experience I'd
care to repeat, Master Bruce.

But then again,
the Reggie I knew died years ago.

After you were hurt...

Selina and I went looking for Reggie.

00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,847
We found him.

He didn'tjump or fall.

504
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,806
Selina pushed him.

505
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,448
And why did she do that?

506
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,331
Reggie was sent here by a man
named Sid Bunderslaw.

507
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,207
Bunderslaw works for Wayne Enterprises.

508
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,606
Reggie gave us the name...

509
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,604
but said he was gonna tell Bunderslaw
what we were doing.

- What did he do?
- Nothing.

518

But he said that my
father and grandfather...

knew about the illegal things that
the company was doing, and chose...
