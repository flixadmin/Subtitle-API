1
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:14,222
Fall back!

2
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:02,812
Brother?

3
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,105
Did you send the ravens?

4
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:33,278
Tarly... look at me.

5
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,283
Did you send the ravens?

6
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,247
That was your job.

7
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,041
Your only job.

8
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,051
We need to get back to the Wall.

9
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,179
It's a long march.

10
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:02,891
We know what's out there...

11
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,978
but we have to make it, have to warn them.

12
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,856
Or before winter's done...

13
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:14,277
everyone you've ever known will be dead.

14
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,036
First time you've seen a giant, Jon Snow?

15
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,792
Well, don't stare too long. They're shy.

16
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:21,089
When they stop being shy, they get angry.

17
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,132
And when they're angry,

18
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:27,011
I've seen them pound a man
straight into the ground

19
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,387
like a hammer on a nail.

20
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,526
-Crow!
-Crow!

21
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:42,860
-Look oνer there!
-Crow!

22
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:47,115
-Don't you dare! Let me do it.
-Crow! Look over here! Look!

23
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,575
Look, crow coming!

24
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:51,911
Crow!

25
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:55,998
-Crow!
-You're wearing the wrong color.

26
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,001
Mance was a ranger.

27
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:04,340
In your hearts,
all you crows want to fly free.

28
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:06,384
When I'm free, will I be free to go?

29
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,553
-Crow!
-Sure, you will.

30
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,808
And I'll be free to kill you.

31
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,854
Got no respect, this lot.

32
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:21,065
Got no fathers to slap them
when they're foul.

33
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,651
What happened to their fathers?

34
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,822
Some of them were killed
by crows like you.

35
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:32,118
Don't look so grim, Jon Snow.

36
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,580
If Mance Rayder likes you,
you'll live another day.

37
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:37,957
And if he don't...

38
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,233
-I smell a crow.
-We killed his friends.

39
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:07,361
Thought you'd want to question this one.

40
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:12,533
-What do we want with a baby crow?
-This baby killed Qhorin Halfhand.

41
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,411
He wants to be one of us.

42
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,296
That half-handed cunt
killed friends of mine.

43
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,173
Friends twice your size.

44
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:32,637
My father told me,
big men fall just as quick as little ones

45
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,223
if you put a sword through their hearts.

46
00:08:37,516 --> 00:08:41,979
Plenty of little men tried to put
their swords through my heart.

47
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:46,359
And there's plenty of little skeletons
buried in the woods.

48
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,239
-What's your name, boy?
-Jon Snow.

49
00:08:58,287 --> 00:08:59,205
Your Grace.

50
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:03,876
Your Grace?

51
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:09,966
Did you hear that? From now on,
you'd better kneel every time I fart.

52
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,677
Stand, boy.

53
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:18,057
We don't kneel for anyone beyond the Wall.

54
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:25,064
So... you're Ned Stark's bastard.

55
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,360
Thank you for the gift,
Lord of Bones. You can leave us.

56
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,871
The girl likes you.

57
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:43,040
You like her back, Snow?

58
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,626
That why you want to join us?

59
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,586
Don't panic, boy.

60
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:52,174
This isn't the damned Night's Watch
where we make you swear off girls.

61
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,928
This chicken-eater you thought was king
is Tormund Giantsbane.

62
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:59,640
Can't believe this...
pup killed the Halfhand.

63
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,143
He was our enemy.

64
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,645
And I'm glad he's dead.

65
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,533
He was my brother once...

66
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,536
back when he had a whole hand.

67
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:23,914
What were you doing with him?

68
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:27,918
The Lord Commander
sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning.

69
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:28,961
Why?

70
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,715
-He wants me to lead one day.
-But here you are...

71
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:34,508
a traitor...

72
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:37,136
kneeling before the King-Beyond-the-Wall.

73
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,013
If I'm a traitor...

74
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,223
then you are, too.

75
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,983
Why do you want to join us, Jon Snow?

76
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,116
I want to be free.

77
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,453
No... I don't think so.

78
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,792
I think what you want most of all
is to be a hero.

79
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,379
I'll ask you one last time.

80
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,298
Why do you want to join us?

81
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,473
We stopped at Craster's Keep
on the way North.

82
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:25,935
I saw...

83
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,729
You saw what?

84
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,693
I saw Craster take his own baby boy
and leave it in the woods.

85
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,488
I saw what took it.

86
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:45,579
You're telling me you saw one of them?

87
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,043
And why would that make you desert
your brothers?

88
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,840
Because when I told the Lord Commander...
he already knew.

89
00:11:58,426 --> 00:11:59,718
Thousands of years ago,

90
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,472
the First Men battled the White Walkers
and defeated them.

91
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:08,060
I want to fight for the side
that fights for the living.

92
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,190
Did I come to the right place?

93
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,865
We'll need to find you a new cloak.

94
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:29,248
-Come on! Move quicker!
-Hurry up!

95
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,712
-The damn sun's everywhere.
-Wait for me!

96
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,513
What if you took off that bit there?

97
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:50,186
Don't you want to leave something
to the imagination?

98
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,981
Trouble is...
I've never had much imagination.

99
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,694
I want you to take it off.

100
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,911
Mouth.

101
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:14,376
Ser Bronn.

102
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:16,420
Ser Bronn.

103
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:19,715
I didn't hear that.

104
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,926
-Apologies, ser.
-Back away.

105
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,179
Keep backing away
till you're outside this establishment.

106
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:28,182
-Then back away some more.
-Lord Tyrion sent me.

107
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,976
I will murder you, boy.

108
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,979
He said
it was a matter of life and death.

109
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,498
Pod?

110
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,627
It's your sister... the queen.

111
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:13,519
-What are they doing here?
-Protecting me, I assume.

112
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,437
Will you let me in?

113
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,482
No, I don't think so.

114
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,235
If I wanted to kill you, do you think
I'd let a wooden door stop me?

115
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:32,121
-They stay outside.
-I'm not afraid of you, little brother.

116
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,055
-Why are you here?
-I wanted to see your face.

117
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:54,184
They said you'd lost your nose,
but it's not as gruesome as all that.

118
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,646
The man who cut me
lost more than his nose.

119
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,106
I should hope so.

120
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:03,444
The rebels came for Joffrey's head,
they lost their own.

121
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:04,820
Thanks to Father.

122
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,406
Thanks to Father.

123
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:11,910
Of course, it wasn't a rebel
who tried to kill me.

124
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,454
No? Curious.

125
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:17,625
Bit of a comedown
from chamber of the Hand.

126
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:20,169
But then I don't suppose
you need much room.

127
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,088
Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke.

128
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:26,925
You must be proud to be as funny
as a man whose balls brush his knees.

129
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,302
You're meeting Father today?

130
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:30,971
How do you know that?

131
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,349
Because I have hundreds of spies
in my employ.

132
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:36,769
The Master of Whisperers
owes me a favor or two.

133
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,231
Father told me.
What do you want from him?

134
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:45,027
What do I want from him? He's my father.
Do I need to want something?

135
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,240
I'm sure he loves me dearly,

136
00:15:50,949 --> 00:15:53,494
as any father loves his child,
his baby boy.

137
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,707
Yet he hasn't come to visit once
since arriving in King's Landing.

138
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:04,046
I lay here, my face split in half,
but Father never came.

139
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,136
You're going to make me cry.

140
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,931
Why do you care what I want from him?

141
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:18,102
Because you've slandered me
to Father before.

142
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:20,145
Slandered? When?

143
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:24,441
You told him I had my guards
beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock.

144
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,235
You did have your guards beat her.

145
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,612
-A girl of nine, I believe.
-I was nine too.

146
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:31,573
She lost an eye if I remember correctly.

147
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,451
If I remember correctly,
she never stole a necklace again.

148
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,581
It's not slander if it's true.

149
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:42,209
And what's this truth
you plan on telling him today?

150
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:46,213
Why are you so nervous
about what I'm going to say to Father?

151
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:47,673
Because you're a liar.

152
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,468
I expect you'll tell lies about me,
about Joffrey.

153
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,679
Any lies in particular?

154
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,099
You're a clever man...

155
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,019
but you're not half as clever
as you think you are.

156
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,855
Still makes me more clever than you.

157
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,571
Look at these two shining warriors.

158
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,615
Ser Taryn Mant and...

159
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:17,077
-Ser Whosit of Whocares.
-Ser Meryn Trant.

160
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,705
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

161
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,582
-You're no knight.
-Pod.

162
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,502
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater
was anointed by the king himself.

163
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:30,257
You're an up-jumped cutthroat...
nothing more.

164
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:34,595
That's exactly who I am.
And you're a grub in fancy armor

165
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:37,014
who's better at beating little girls
than fighting men.

166
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:39,975
Now, I have an appointment
with Lord Tyrion.

167
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,102
You put your hand on that door...

168
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,354
you lose the hand.

169
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,249
As much as I appreciate
a walk in the sunshine, your lordship.

170
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,293
I am wondering why you sent for me.

171
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,545
A number of people
in this city want to kill me.

172
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:09,797
You're here to protect me.

173
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:13,884
-I've been doing that for a while now.
-Do you grow bored protecting me?

174
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:17,096
-I grow poor protecting you.
-Poor? Poor?

175
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,473
Under my patronage,
you've become a knight,

176
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,517
you've served
as commander of the City Watch.

177
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,353
-Briefly.
-I'm sure you filled your pockets.

178
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,938
And now, my pockets are empty.

179
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,857
You've given me a taste
for the finer things.

180
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,984
And if you want me
to carry on protecting you,

181
00:18:31,068 --> 00:18:33,612
-you'll need to pay more.
-I thought we were friends.

182
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:37,449
We are. But I'm a sellsword.
I sell my sword.

183
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,201
I don't loan it out to friends as a favor.

184
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,744
-How much?
-Double.

185
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,496
-Double?
-I'm a knight now.

186
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,456
Knights are worth double.

187
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,042
I don't even know
how much I'm paying you now.

188
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:48,585
Which means you can afford it.

189
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,750
Here. Here!

190
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,595
Help me!

191
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:04,661
Who are you?

192
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,040
I was in the battle...

193
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,542
at Blackwater.

194
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,462
I was a captain...

195
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:18,842
-and a knight.
-Aye, ser, and serving which king?

196
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,601
The one true king of Westeros...

197
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,230
Stannis Baratheon.

198
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:43,700
I thought you were dead.

199
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,953
Everyone thought you were dead.

200
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,501
And your son?

201
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:03,053
-He may have swam ashore as you did.
-No, the wildfire took him. I saw it.

202
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,815
I'm so sorry, my friend.

203
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,068
I, too, have lost a son.

204
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,196
There is nothing worse in this world.

205
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:25,993
But, Davos... you were a good father.

206
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,538
If I was a good father,
he'd still be here.

207
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,084
Stannis lives?

208
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,629
-He licks his wounds at Dragonstone.
-Will you take me there?

209
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:42,384
-There is nothing for me at Dragonstone.
-This war is not over.

210
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:46,513
Not for you maybe.
But for Salladhor Saan, the war is over.

211
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:50,308
-We're both sworn to King Stannis.
-I am sworn to no man.

212
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:54,896
I promised you 30 ships
and you promised me riches and glory.

213
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,650
-I delivered the ships.
-Stannis never gives up. Never.

214
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,736
-Now, he will regroup--
-He's a broken man.

215
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,363
His fleet lies
at the bottom of Blackwater Bay.

216
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:07,200
They say he sees no one,
not his generals, not even his wife.

217
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,077
Only the Red Woman...

218
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,790
whispering in his ear,
telling him what she sees in the flames...

219
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,419
-and burning men alive.
-What?

220
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,255
They built a great fire
when Stannis returned.

221
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:26,553
All those who spoke against her,
she called servants of darkness.

222
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:31,099
They say she sang to them as they burned.

223
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,647
I'm a pirate.

224
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,441
You're a smuggler.

225
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:41,401
Servants of darkness.

226
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,447
I'm thinking Dragonstone
is a good place for us to avoid.

227
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,157
Take me back there, please.

228
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,202
-You cannot turn Stannis against her.
-Maybe not,

229
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,996
-but I could carve her heart out.
-You could try.

230
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:58,752
If you fail, they will burn you.
If you succeed, they'll burn you.

231
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:00,754
And you've only just come back to life.

232
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,423
Stay alive a little longer, my friend.

233
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,551
You call me friend.
You drank with me on my wedding day.

234
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,970
And you drank with me
on four of my wedding days,

235
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:12,891
-but I don't ask you for favors.
-I have to stop her. Please.

236
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:14,851
Do this for me.

237
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:22,734
When you are dead...
I will gather your bones in a little sack,

238
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,946
and let your widow
wear them around her neck.

239
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:41,920
We should set the siege lines
1,000 yards from Harrenhal.

240
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:45,298
There won't be a siege.
The Mountain can't defend a ruin.

241
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:46,967
I imagine the Mountain will defend

242
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,426
Whatever Tywin Lannister
tells him to defend.

243
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,929
The Lannisters have been running
from us since Oxcross.

244
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:53,682
I'd love a fight.
The men would love a fight.

245
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:56,309
I don't think we're going to get one.

246
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:48,361
Two hundred Northmen
slaughtered like sheep.

247
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,198
The debt will be repaid, my friend.

248
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:54,201
For them and for your sons.

249
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:55,994
Will it?

250
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:00,999
They rot in the ground
while their killer runs free.

251
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:06,254
The Kingslayer won't remain free for long.
My best hunters are after him.

252
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:27,317
A Mallister?

253
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:29,402
Ser Jeremy.

254
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,072
My father's bannerman.

255
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:55,428
Find her a chamber
that will serve as a cell.

256
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:11,111
-She's your mother.
-She freed Jaime Lannister.

257
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:16,324
The Lannisters robbed them of their sons,
and she robbed them of their justice.

258
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:19,786
Water.

259
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,039
Water.

260
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,292
This needs to be cleaned and closed.

261
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:31,923
What's your name, friend?

262
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:33,883
Qyburn.

263
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:35,677
You're lucky to be alive.

264
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:40,181
Lucky?

265
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,169
The badge looks good on you.

266
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,423
Almost as good as it looked on me.

267
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:18,470
Are you enjoying your new position?

268
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:24,351
-Am I enjoying it?
-I was very happy as Hand of the King.

269
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,813
Yes. I heard how happy you were.

270
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,526
You brought a whore into my bed.

271
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:36,112
It wasn't your bed at the time.

272
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,034
I sent you here to advise the king.

273
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:45,121
I gave you real power and authority.

274
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:51,711
You chose to spend your days,
as you always have... bedding harlots...

275
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,714
and drinking with thieves.

276
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:59,469
Occasionally, I drank with the harlots.

277
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:01,971
What do you want, Tyrion?

278
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:04,432
Why does everyone assume
I want something?

279
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,727
Can't I simply visit
with my beloved father?

280
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:10,730
My beloved father who...

281
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:16,653
somehow forgot to visit his wounded son
after he fell on the battlefield.

282
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:19,989
Maester Pycelle assured me
your wounds were not fatal.

283
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,325
I organized the defense of this city...

284
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,453
while you held court
in the ruins of Harrenhal.

285
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:29,207
I led the foray
when the enemies were at the gate

286
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:33,628
while your grandson, the king,
quivered in fear behind the walls.

287
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:37,590
I bled in the mud for our family.

288
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:42,429
And as my reward, I was trundled off
to some dark little cell.

289
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,181
But what do I want?

290
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,685
A little bloody gratitude
would be a start.

291
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:54,232
Jugglers and singers require applause.
You are a Lannister.

292
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:57,986
Do you think I demanded a garland of roses

293
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,363
every time I suffered a wound
on a battlefield?

294
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:06,035
Now, I have seven kingdoms
to look after,

295
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,706
and three of them
are in open rebellion. So...

296
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,376
tell me what you want.

297
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:19,883
I want what is mine by right.

298
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:25,346
Jaime is your eldest son,
heir to your lands and titles.

299
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:29,017
But he is a Kingsguard,
forbidden from marriage or inheritance.

300
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:34,230
The day Jaime put on the white cloak,
he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock.

301
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,443
I am your son and lawful heir.

302
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,824
-You want Casterly Rock?
-It is mine by right.

303
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,917
We'll find you accommodations
more suited to your name

304
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:58,880
and as a reward for your accomplishments
during the Battle of Blackwater Bay.

305
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,134
And when the time is right,
you will be given a position

306
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,427
fit for your talents.

307
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:08,765
So that you can serve your family
and protect our legacy.

308
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:13,520
And if you serve faithfully,
you will be rewarded with a suitable wife.

309
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,357
And I would let myself
be consumed by maggots

310
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,444
before mocking the family name
and making you heir to Casterly Rock.

311
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,365
-Why?
-Why?

312
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,492
You ask that?

313
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,287
You, who killed your mother
to come into the world?

314
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,375
You are an ill-made,
spiteful little creature,

315
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:39,295
full of envy, lust, and low cunning.

316
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,924
Men's laws give you the right
to bear my name

317
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:47,220
and display my colors since I cannot
prove that you are not mine.

318
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,516
And to teach me humility,
the gods have condemned me

319
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:54,894
to watch you waddle about
wearing that proud lion

320
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:58,064
that was my father's sigil
and his father's before him.

321
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,818
But neither gods nor men
will ever compel me

322
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:04,988
to let you turn Casterly Rock
into your whorehouse.

323
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:08,366
Go, now.

324
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:16,040
Speak no more of your rights
to Casterly Rock.

325
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:19,586
Go.

326
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:30,805
One more thing.

327
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:36,728
The next whore
I catch in your bed, I'll hang.

328
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,237
Dorne.

329
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:48,072
It's going to Dorne.

330
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,450
-Why Dorne?
-It's carrying silk,

331
00:31:50,908 --> 00:31:53,953
and it's supposed to bring
back wine in exchange.

332
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,209
But it's not coming back.

333
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:05,548
The captain's tired of risking his life
so King's Landing lords and ladies

334
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,259
can get drunk
on better wine than they deserve.

335
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:11,638
He's going to stay in Dorne.

336
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,557
Wait out the winter
where it's beautiful and warm.

337
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:19,145
I met some people in Dorne
who weren't so beautiful and warm.

338
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:20,855
Don't ruin the game.

339
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,775
I told you I don't want to play.

340
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,778
What about that one there?

341
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:28,488
That one?

342
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,365
It's going to Volantis.

343
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:32,241
Why?

344
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:35,370
Because when I got on a ship in Volantis,
it looked like that one.

345
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:38,581
That's not how the game works.

346
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:41,584
You're not supposed
to just blurt out the right answer.

347
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,963
You've got to invent a story
about where the ship is going and why.

348
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:50,093
Why should I make up a story
when I know the truth?

349
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:54,764
Because the truth is always
either terrible or boring.

350
00:32:54,847 --> 00:32:55,807
Lovely day for it.

351
00:32:57,975 --> 00:32:59,102
Watching the ships.

352
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:00,853
Lord Baelish.

353
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:06,818
Might I speak
with Lady Sansa alone for a moment?

354
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,957
I saw your mother not long ago.

355
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:24,836
She's very eager to see you...

356
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,423
and your sister.

357
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:31,592
Arya's alive?

358
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:40,852
-You said you'd take me home.
-You said King's Landing was your home.

359
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:45,732
You are the property of the crown.
Stealing you would be treason,

360
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:48,693
-if you were to tell just one person.
-I won't tell anyone.

361
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:51,362
-How do I know?
-Because I'm a terrible liar.

362
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,448
You said so yourself.

363
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:57,452
Please, Lord Baelish.
Tell me what to do. Tell me when.

364
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,623
I'm waiting for word on an assignment

365
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,625
that will take me far away
from the capital.

366
00:34:06,043 --> 00:34:09,505
When I set sail,
I might be able to take you with me.

367
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:12,675
But you'll need to be ready
to leave on a moment's notice.

368
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:16,888
You're her handmaiden?

369
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:24,520
-Yes. And you're his...
-I help manage his affairs.

370
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,442
-He's an important person.
-So is she.

371
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,819
I grew up in the shadow
of her father's castle.

372
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,823
The day she was born, they rang
the bells from sunrise till sunset.

373
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:41,120
We've both done rather well, you and I.

374
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:45,416
Yes.

375
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,293
Given where we started.

376
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:50,671
And where is that?

377
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:56,344
It's not easy for girls like us
to dig our way out.

378
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,142
Watch out for her.

379
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:06,062
I always do.

380
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:09,482
Watch out for her with him.

381
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:04,245
They're growing fast.

382
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,125
Not fast enough.

383
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:11,752
I can't wait that long.

384
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:17,133
I need an army.

385
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:20,803
We'll be in Astapor by nightfall.

386
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:25,474
Some say the Unsullied
are the greatest soldiers in the world.

387
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:28,269
The greatest slave soldiers in the world.

388
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,730
The distinction means
a good deal to some people.

389
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:34,775
Do those people have any better ideas
about how to put you on the Iron Throne?

390
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:39,447
It's too beautiful a day to argue.

391
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,160
You're right.

392
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:51,208
-Another lovely day on the high seas.
-Don't mock them.

393
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:54,128
They're the first Dothraki
who have ever been on a ship.

394
00:36:54,211 --> 00:36:56,380
They followed me across the poison water.

395
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:59,258
If they'll do it, others will.
And with a true khalasar--

396
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:02,762
The Dothraki followed strength
above all, Khaleesi.

397
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,766
You'll have a true Khalasar
when you prove yourself strong.

398
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:08,809
And not before.

399
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:37,838
Your Grace.

400
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:50,768
I heard you were dead.

401
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:53,396
Not yet.

402
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,609
I had hoped to speak
to you alone, Your Grace.

403
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:00,987
We are alone.

404
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:14,125
Your Grace, you are the rightful king.

405
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:16,669
Not only by blood.

406
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,006
You're an honorable man, a just man.

407
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,883
And there is still a war to fight.

408
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:24,927
I am fighting.

409
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:27,888
By burning prisoners alive?

410
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,893
How would you punish
the infidels, Ser Davos?

411
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:35,604
I do not judge people
for the gods they worship.

412
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:39,775
If I did, I'd have thrown you in the sea
before you ever set foot on Dragonstone.

413
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,611
-I'm not your enemy.
-You are my enemy.

414
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,160
Was it me you fought on Blackwater Bay?

415
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,496
Did I set your ships ablaze?

416
00:38:56,959 --> 00:39:00,296
I wasn't there when the wildfire
killed our men by the thousands.

417
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,508
I could have saved those men.

418
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:07,011
You would have taken the city,

419
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:09,096
Stannis would now sit
upon his rightful throne,

420
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,389
and you would stand beside him.

421
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:16,562
But I wasn't there, because you convinced
your king to leave me behind.

422
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,031
Do you hear them screaming?

423
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,701
All those burning men in the water...

424
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:36,165
crying for their mothers,
for their gods for help...

425
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:39,460
until the moment
the Blackwater swallowed them.

426
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,552
Don't despair, Ser Davos.

427
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,305
What I told your son is true.

428
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:55,935
Death by fire is the purest death.

429
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:01,565
This woman is evil!
She's the mother of demons.

430
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03,984
Take him to the dungeon,
and lock him in a cell.

431
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,569
-Your Grace!
-Come on.

432
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:08,697
-You've chosen the darkness, Ser Davos.
-She will destroy us all!

433
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:09,949
I will pray for you.

434
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:11,784
Your Grace!

435
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,605
Halt. Down.

436
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,151
Halt... down.

437
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,202
-Why have we stopped?
-It's Lady Margaery, Your Grace.

438
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,668
What is she doing?
Who gave her permission?

439
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:07,381
-My lady. We should have guards, my lady.
-Why?

440
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:13,387
Pardon me.

441
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,731
Stop, my lady. You'll ruin your dress.

442
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:25,691
I have others.

443
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:34,033
Would you like to speak with her,
Your Grace?

444
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:38,621
No.

445
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:40,206
He was a soldier.

446
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:45,127
He went to fight on the walls
when the ships came into Blackwater Bay.

447
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,338
He never came back.

448
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,089
And your mother?

449
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:51,675
She died when she had me.

450
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:57,014
Bad men wanted to come into this city

451
00:41:57,097 --> 00:42:00,434
and do terrible things,
but your father stopped them.

452
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:10,945
Whenever you look at this knight,
I want you to remember your father.

453
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:17,618
He wasn't a knight. He was just a soldier.

454
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,954
And what do knights swear to do?

455
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:23,415
Protect the weak and uphold the good.

456
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,794
Your father did that. Be proud of him.

457
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,549
Was your father a soldier, too?

458
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:36,303
You should be proud, too.

459
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:44,270
Under King Joffrey's leadership,
your fathers saved the city.

460
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,230
They saved us all.

461
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,984
From now on,
we're going to take care of you.

462
00:42:52,861 --> 00:42:53,779
All of you.

463
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:04,665
Come to me for whatever you need
to feed them, clothe them, or house them.

464
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,003
Directly to me.

465
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:15,301
Okay.

466
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:26,020
Your Grace.

467
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:28,147
-Your Grace.
-Please, sit. Sit.

468
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,065
I do apologize, my lady.

469
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:32,609
Small council meetings.

470
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,905
At what point does it become treason
to waste the king's time?

471
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,747
-That's a lovely gown, my lady.
-Yes, it suits you perfectly.

472
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:47,416
I imagine you might be rather cold.

473
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:51,337
The climate is a bit more forgiving
back in Highgarden, Your Grace.

474
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:53,672
Shall I have them
bring you a shawl, my lady?

475
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,759
I am touched by your concern, Your Grace.

476
00:43:57,259 --> 00:44:00,596
Luckily for us Tyrells,
our blood runs quite warm.

477
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:02,348
-Doesn't it, Loras?
-Yes.

478
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:05,392
Loras, isn't the queen's gown magnificent?

479
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:10,397
The fabric, the embroidery, the metalwork.
I've never seen anything like it.

480
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:14,693
You might find a bit of armor quite useful
once you become queen. Perhaps before.

481
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:18,739
Joffrey tells me you stopped
your carriage at Flea Bottom

482
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,491
on your way back
from the sept this morning.

483
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:21,867
Yes.

484
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:26,080
I paid a visit to an orphanage
the High Septon told me about.

485
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,416
Margaery does a great deal of work
with the poor back in Highgarden.

486
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:32,544
The lowest among us are no different
from the highest

487
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:35,923
if you give them a chance
and approach them with an open heart.

488
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:38,008
An open heart is what you'll get
in Flea Bottom

489
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,385
if you're not careful, my dear.

490
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,554
Not long ago, we were attacked
by a mob there.

491
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:46,308
We had a full complement of guards
who didn't stop them.

492
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,353
The king barely escaped with his life.

493
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:52,272
My mother's always
had a penchant for drama.

494
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:57,194
Facts become less and less important
to her as she grows older.

495
00:44:57,903 --> 00:45:00,030
Our lives were never truly in danger.

496
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:05,244
You're right, of course.
But you are your father's son.

497
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,497
We can't all have a king's bravery.

498
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:19,383
Hunger turns men into beasts.

499
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:23,053
I'm glad House Tyrell has been able
to help in this regard.

500
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,807
They tell me 100 wagons arrive daily
now from the Reach.

501
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:30,561
Wheat, barley, apples.
We've had a blessed harvest.

502
00:45:30,644 --> 00:45:34,314
And, of course, it's our duty
to assist the capital in time of need.

503
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:38,986
Well, as Ser Loras said,
Lady Margaery has done this sort of...

504
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,573
charitable work before.

505
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:44,908
I'm sure she knows what she's doing.

506
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:48,162
I'm sure she does.

507
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:20,277
The Unsullied have stood here
for a day and a night

508
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,820
with no food or water.

509
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:30,287
They will stand until they drop.

510
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,500
Such is their obedience.

511
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,504
They may suit my needs.

512
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:40,339
Tell me of their training.

513
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:03,237
They begin their training at 5:00.

514
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:08,200
Every day, they drill from dawn to dusk
until they have mastered the short sword,

515
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:10,244
the shield, and the three spears.

516
00:47:10,827 --> 00:47:13,872
Only one boy in four
survives this rigorous training.

517
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:20,295
Their discipline and loyalty are absolute.

518
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:21,463
They fear nothing.

519
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:24,299
Even the bravest men fear death.

520
00:47:46,321 --> 00:47:50,909
My master says the Unsullied are not men.
Death means nothing to them.

521
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,671
He begs you attend
to this carefully, Your Grace.

522
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:19,563
Tell the good master there is no need.

523
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:30,157
My master points out
that men don't need nipples.

524
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:52,137
To win his shield, an Unsullied must go
to the slave marts with a silver mark,

525
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:56,808
find a newborn, and kill it
before its mother's eyes.

526
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,438
"This way," my master says,

527
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:03,774
"we make certain
there is no weakness left in them."

528
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,819
You take a babe from its mother's arms,

529
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:12,074
kill it as she watches,
and pay for her pain with a silver coin?

530
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:29,216
My master would like you to know
that the silver is paid

531
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:31,343
to the baby's owner, not the mother.

532
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,726
How many do you have to sell?

533
00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:46,233
Eight thousand.

534
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:54,366
Master Kraznys asks
that you please hurry.

535
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:56,410
Many other buyers are interested.

536
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:12,509
-Eight thousand dead babies.
-The Unsullied are a means to an end.

537
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:17,597
-Once I own them, these men--
-They're not men. Not anymore.

538
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:21,601
Once I own an army of slaves,
what will I be?

539
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,854
Do you think
these slaves will have better lives

540
00:50:23,937 --> 00:50:26,648
serving Kraznys and men like him
or serving you?

541
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:44,374
You'll be fair to them.
You won't mutilate them to make a point.

542
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:52,132
You won't order them to murder babies.

543
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:54,009
You'll see they're properly fed
and sheltered.

544
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:57,220
A great injustice has been done to them.

545
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:00,640
Closing your eyes will not undo it.

546
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,115
The warlocks.

547
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:05,372
I owe you my life, ser.

548
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:09,292
The honor is mine... my queen.

549
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:14,798
You know this man?

550
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:17,133
I know him...

551
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:21,179
as one of the greatest fighters
the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen...

552
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:26,268
and as the Lord Commander
of Robert Baratheon's Kingsguard.

553
00:52:28,144 --> 00:52:29,104
King Robert is dead.

554
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:32,691
I have been searching for you,
Daenerys Stormborn,

555
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:34,442
to ask your forgiveness.

556
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:37,571
I was sworn to protect your family.

557
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,283
I failed them.

558
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:51,585
I am Barristan Selmy...
Kingsguard to your father.

559
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:57,215
Allow me to join your Queensguard...
and I will not fail you again.
