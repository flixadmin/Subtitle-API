1
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,203
Manuel.

2
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,331
Manuel!

3
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,263
Manuel.

4
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,571
I think....

5
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,950
I think I found you one.

6
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:08,540
Look, I called you, right?

7
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:14,921
Soon as I couldn't pull it out myself,
I called you, John.

8
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:32,939
It's okay, it's okay.
We had to tie her down, okay?

9
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,983
It's okay.

10
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,872
This is Constantine.

11
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:36,169
John Constantine, asshole.

12
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:45,679
Sure.

13
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,870
What the hell?

14
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:28,847
I need a mirror.

15
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:32,142
Now. At least 3 feet high.

16
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:33,560
Move! Go, now!

17
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,869
This is Kramer.

18
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:54,414
Chas Kramer, asshole.

19
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,291
Asshole.

20
00:06:56,458 --> 00:07:01,671
What? Oh, this is Kramer.
Chas Kramer, asshole.

21
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,965
Chas!
-What?

22
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:06,885
-Move the car.
-Why?

23
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,846
Move the damn car!

24
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:14,267
"Chas, move the car."

25
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:17,812
There, car's moved.

26
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:30,951
Lift it up over the bed.

27
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:37,040
Tie that end off.
Hennessy, over the top.

28
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:43,713
Close your eyes.
And whatever happens, don't look.

29
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:56,893
No!

30
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:06,152
Show yourself.

31
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,283
Smile pretty, you vain prick.

32
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:21,876
For your boss.

33
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,255
Pull it!

34
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,658
Ma? Ma?

35
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:34,032
Like I said, I found you something,
didn't I, John? Didn't I?

36
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,867
What happened in there?

37
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,543
Going to a lot of meetings, I see.

38
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,837
Keeps the voices out so I can sleep.

39
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,466
I have to sleep, John.

40
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,677
I need some help, Father.

41
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:56,971
You do?

42
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:58,890
From me?

43
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,767
What kind of--7?

44
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:07,190
-Hey, listen, I--
-That exorcism wasn't right.

45
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,028
Listen to the ether.

46
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:16,616
Anything unusual, you let me know.

47
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:22,163
Come on, you don't need its protection.
It'll be like back in the day.

48
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,544
A few days.

49
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,045
Okay.

50
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:32,632
Okay. For you, John.

51
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:39,597
John, why would you do that
if you know it's not my car?

52
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:42,350
-I told you to move it.
-You did tell me to move it...

53
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:46,020
...but if you'd said you were dropping
a 300-pound mirror with a demon...

54
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,022
...I would've moved it further, John.

55
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:51,860
Take Alvarado.
-Yeah, thank you. I know what to take.

56
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:56,906
You ever think if you told me more now
that maybe I could help out?

57
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,408
-No?
Nope.

58
00:10:58,575 --> 00:10:59,909
Nope?

59
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,162
Of course it's a nope.

60
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,825
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

61
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,080
It's been...

62
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:50,293
...Iwo weeks since my last confession.

63
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,840
I killed a man today.

64
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,635
Another one.

65
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:08,061
I didn't even see his face, I just...

66
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,481
...pulled the trigger, and he went away.

67
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:18,863
Most cops go 20 years
without firing their guns.

68
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:24,118
Why do I always know
where these guys are?

69
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:27,622
Where to aim, when to fire.

70
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:32,210
I'm wondering, is there
something wrong with me, Father?

71
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:35,046
Something damned?

72
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:40,551
God has a plan for you.
He has a plan for us all.

73
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:45,139
You mustn't let your faith
be overshadowed by guilt.

74
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:47,350
Yeah, I'm trying.

75
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,603
I'm trying real hard.

76
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,523
Isabel.

77
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,743
Isabel.

78
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:45,676
Things I've beaten.

79
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:49,555
Things most people never even heard of.

80
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:53,142
And now I'm gonna be done in by this.

81
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,604
Wouldn't be the first, John.

82
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,525
Come on, Les.

83
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,027
You saved me before,
you can do it again, right?

84
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:06,072
This is aggressive.

85
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:10,326
Twenty years ago,
you didn't wanna be here.

86
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:13,496
Now you don't wanna leave.

87
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,332
Yeah, that's a good idea.

88
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,295
John, you really need to prepare.

89
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:28,845
-Make arrangements.
-No need.

90
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:32,181
I already know exactly where I'm going.

91
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,146
-Morning.
Good morning.

92
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:41,274
-Good morning.
Detective.

93
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,276
- No, no, no.
Angela, wait.

94
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,112
You don't need to see this, okay? No.

95
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:48,781
Give us the room, please.

96
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,064
Isabel.

97
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,073
She fell from the roof?

98
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,075
She jumped.

99
00:16:35,286 --> 00:16:36,829
-No.
Look...

100
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:41,167
...I know it's hard to accept.
She was sick.

101
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:53,221
-Isabel wouldn't kill herself.
Angie.

102
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,932
-She wouldn't kill herself.
-Detective.

103
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,433
Period.
-Detective.

104
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,227
Period!

105
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,981
Angie, there were security cameras.

106
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:16,786
-Hold the door. You going down?
-Not if I can help it.

107
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,088
A new case?

108
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:15,011
The big score? The mother lode?
The one you've been waiting for?

109
00:18:15,261 --> 00:18:18,222
-Humor me.
Don't I always?

110
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:26,814
Oh, yeah, that's--
Much obliged. Thank you.

111
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,526
How you feeling, John?

112
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,361
So, what's new?

113
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,073
Uh....

114
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:40,411
Bullet shavings from
the assassination attempt on the pope...

115
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:44,206
...holy-water ampoules
from the River Jordan...

116
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:49,295
...and-- Oh, you'll love this.
--screech beetle from Amityville.

117
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:55,551
Yeah, it's funny to you, but to the
fallen, that's like nails on a chalkboard.

118
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58,846
What is it, exactly, with you and bugs?

119
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:01,932
I just like them.

120
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,976
Yeah. Who doesn't?

121
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,189
Yeah, easy there, hero.

122
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:11,942
-That's dragon's breath.
-I thought you couldn't get it anymore.

123
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,611
Yeah, well, I...

124
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,906
...know a guy who knows a guy.

125
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:26,666
So, what's the action?

126
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:30,920
I just pulled a soldier demon
out of a little girl.

127
00:19:31,337 --> 00:19:34,173
Looked like it was trying
to come through.

128
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,218
Yeah, I know how it sounds.

129
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:39,679
No, we're finger puppets
to them, John...

130
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,222
...not doorways.

131
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:45,476
They can work us, but they can't
come through onto our plane.

132
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:48,270
Check the scrolls anyway.
See if there's any precedent.

133
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,940
Sure thing, John. Uh....

134
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,109
Anything else?

135
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:56,320
Wouldn't happen to have
anything for a, uh--?

136
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,323
On the house.

137
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:03,828
All right, question. How much
longer do I have to be your slave, John?

138
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:07,957
You're not my slave, Chas.

139
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:11,836
You're my very appreciated apprentice.

140
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,171
Like Tonto or Robin.

141
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,049
Or that skinny fellow
with the fat friend.

142
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:21,095
Right. So then why don't I apprentice
something besides driving, then, John?

143
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:25,683
John? John.

144
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,603
I love our little talks, John.

145
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,035
May I take your coat, Mr. Constantine?

146
00:20:45,202 --> 00:20:47,997
No, thanks,
I'm not gonna be staying long.

147
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:52,752
How about you, ma'am?
-Oh, no, I'm not staying long either.

148
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:55,421
I really need to speak with him.
It's very important.

149
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:58,299
First come, first served.

150
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:04,555
Oh. So you're rude
no matter where you are.

151
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,149
-Father.
Hi.

152
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,736
-You have news.
Yes, I spoke with the bishop.

153
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:20,821
Yes.

154
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:28,120
I know what you want, son.

155
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,832
Still keeping your all-seeing eye
on me, Gabriel?

156
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:35,419
I'm flattered.

157
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,839
Well, I could offer something...

158
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:43,260
...about how a shepherd leads
even the most wayward of his flock...

159
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:45,513
...but it might sound disingenuous.

160
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,432
She has to have a Catholic funeral,
Father. She has to.

161
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:52,812
-Angela, it's still considered a mortal sin.
-She didn't commit suicide.

162
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,606
The bishop believes otherwise.
You know the rules.

163
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,858
Oh, rules.

164
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,860
Father.

165
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,612
David.

166
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:05,199
This is Isabel.

167
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:09,119
God was the only one
she ever believed loved her.

168
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,747
Please.

169
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,333
I'm sorry.

170
00:22:17,211 --> 00:22:20,673
I've been seeing some
unusual soul traffic lately.

171
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,592
You might consider
giving me an extension.

172
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:26,345
I could do your side some good
these days.

173
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:28,764
You still trying to buy your way
into heaven?

174
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,685
What about the minions
I've sent back?

175
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:37,022
-That alone should guarantee my entry.
-How many times have I told you?

176
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,191
That's not the way this works.

177
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,069
Why, haven't I served him enough?

178
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,990
-What does he want from me?
-Only the usual.

179
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:49,243
Self-sacrifice, belief.

180
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,621
-Oh, I believe, for chrissake.
-No, no, you know.

181
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,040
And there's a difference. You've seen.

182
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:59,879
I never asked to see.
I was born with this curse.

183
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,131
A qift, John.

184
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:04,800
One that you've squandered
on selfish endeavors.

185
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:08,512
I'm pulling demons out of little girls.

186
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:10,514
Who's that for?

187
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:15,227
Everything you've ever done,
you've only ever done for yourself.

188
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,646
To earn your way
back into his good graces.

189
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:20,441
Impossible rules, endless regulations...

190
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:23,569
...who goes up, who goes down
and why.

191
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,827
You don't even understand us.

192
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,122
You're the one who should go
to hell, half-breed.

193
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:49,845
Why me, Gabriel?

194
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,682
It's personal, isn't it?

195
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:59,563
I didn't go to church enough,
I didn't pray enough...

196
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:04,193
...I was 5 bucks short
in the collection plate. Why?

197
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:08,948
You are going to die young...

198
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:13,035
...because you smoked 30 cigarettes
a day since you were 15.

199
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:16,080
And you're going to go to hell...

200
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:19,291
...because of the life you took.

201
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:26,173
You're fucked.

202
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,229
At least it's nice out.

203
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:46,110
He always had a rotten sense of humor.

204
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:55,327
And his punch lines are Killers.

205
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,002
John!

206
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,339
Constantine, it's raining! John! Hey!

207
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:23,522
Twenty-two women were found
buried in the assailant's back yard.

208
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:27,401
So much damage had been done
to the bodies, police had to match....

209
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:30,029
Police report she had been
physically penetrated...

210
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,948
...over 100 times and buried alive.

211
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:36,869
--found locked in a freezer,
his head severed and his organs....

212
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,829
He stuffed Holly's body into....

213
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:43,000
The bodies ravished....
He used a small handsaw....

214
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:46,628
Had nearly decapitated...
Even his eyes were gouged out.

215
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,464
Isabel.

216
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:14,531
I'm so sorry, Izzy.

217
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,784
Constantine.

218
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:52,778
Dodson.

219
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,738
Hello?

220
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,199
Hello.

221
00:27:02,788 --> 00:27:04,456
Hello?

222
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,897
Hey. Hey, buddy, got a light?

223
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:44,389
Should've minded
your own business, exorcist.

224
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:11,250
I know where you're going, John.
You're going to Midnite's.

225
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,085
You're supposed to wait in the cab.

226
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:17,047
It's a haven for those who rise and fall.
I remember reading about this, John.

227
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,967
-You read too much, kid. It's a bar.
-It's a bar?

228
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:24,513
It's a bar. Papa Midnite is a crusader for
good. He swore the oath of neutrality.

229
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,307
-John, the man's a legend.
-Yeah.

230
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,977
Can you please get me
into this bar, John, please?

231
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,687
I'm begging you, John, please?

232
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:35,023
-Sure, you can get in.
-l can get in?

233
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,401
If you can get in.

234
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:41,863
If I can get--? It's a bear, though, right?
Or two ducks in a cloud?

235
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,619
Two frogs on a bench.

236
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,917
Two frogs on a bench.

237
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:56,086
No, no, I'm with the guy you just--

238
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:58,130
John! John!

239
00:29:58,297 --> 00:30:00,299
I'm with him, though.

240
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:03,385
Rat in a dress.

241
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,930
Of course it is. Rat in a dress.

242
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:09,057
I'm just testing. I'm just testing.

243
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,197
Don't get up.

244
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:08,867
You've been absent some time.

245
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:12,037
Have you come here with relics to sell?

246
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:15,624
No, I'm out of that now.
I've been too busy.

247
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,669
Perhaps peddling forgeries has ended up
being bad for your health.

248
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:21,797
Midnite, Jesus...

249
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:25,384
...I thought the thing was authentic.

250
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,013
I see now.

251
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:33,517
Your health is bad for other reasons.
How long?

252
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,477
A few months, maybe a year.

253
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:38,313
I thought I heard thunder last night.

254
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,608
Must have been
Satan's stomach growling.

255
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,904
You're the one soul he'd come
up here himself to collect.

256
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:48,407
So I've heard.

257
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:51,868
Well, I am most certain
you did not come here...

258
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:55,205
...for a sympathetic shoulder
to cry on.

259
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:01,294
A demon just attacked me,
right out in the open on Figueroa.

260
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,713
They don't like you, John.

261
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,757
How many have you
deported back to hell?

262
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:10,470
Not some angry half-breed, Midnite.
A full-fledged demon, here, on our plane.

263
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:13,390
Clearly I do not have to remind you
that is impossible.

264
00:32:13,557 --> 00:32:15,892
And yesterday I saw a soldier demon...

265
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,562
...trying to chew its way out
through a little girl.

266
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:23,483
Listen, John, demons stay in hell,
angels in heaven...

267
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:26,194
...the great détente
of the original superpowers.

268
00:32:26,403 --> 00:32:31,283
Thanks for the history lesson, Midnite.
You've been a tremendous help.

269
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,034
Now...

270
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,663
...I need to use the chair.

271
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:44,463
John, forgetting the fact that it would
almost certainly kill you...

272
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,339
...you know I am neutral.

273
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:50,760
And as long as the balance
is maintained, I take no sides.

274
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:54,556
Before you were a bartender...

275
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:59,102
...you were one witch doctor
against, what, 30 Ashgar?

276
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,981
-And [--
-You were Constantine.

277
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:06,526
The John Constantine.

278
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:08,987
Once.

279
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:13,742
This isn't the usual game, I can feel it.

280
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:16,328
Something's coming.

281
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:19,122
Ooh, spooky.

282
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:21,124
Balthazar.

283
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:25,378
That expression alone
has made my entire night.

284
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:27,506
I'll make your night.

285
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:31,384
I'll deport your sorry ass right where
you stand, you half-breed shit!

286
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:37,891
You know the rules of my house.
While here, you will abide by them.

287
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:40,018
Johnny boy.

288
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:46,691
Word is you're on your way down.

289
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,069
Fresh meat.

290
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,699
Finger-licking good.

291
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,868
We have a meeting now, John.

292
00:34:04,918 --> 00:34:07,170
What? I didn't catch that.

293
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:52,966
Welcome to my life.

294
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:03,852
Mr. Constantine.

295
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:08,398
-I saw you--
-I remember.

296
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:12,027
-And then I saw you at the--
-Regular kismet.

297
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:16,740
I'd like to ask you a few questions,
if that would be okay.

298
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:19,993
I'm not really in the talking mood
right now.

299
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,829
Well, maybe you could just listen then.

300
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,123
Please?

301
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:30,920
Always a catch.

302
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:48,480
My sister was murdered yesterday.

303
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:51,608
-Sorry to hear.
-Thanks.

304
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:56,863
She was a patient at Ravenscar.
She jumped off the roof.

305
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,491
Thought you said she was murdered.

306
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:02,661
Yeah, well, Isabel wouldn't
have taken her own life.

307
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:06,498
Yeah, what kind of mental patient
kills herself?

308
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:09,584
That's just crazy.

309
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:17,467
Look, I've heard your name
around the precinct.

310
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:22,847
I know the circles you travel in.
The occult, demonology, exorcisms.

311
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:26,643
Just before my sister was committed,
she became deeply paranoid.

312
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:31,523
She started talking about demons,
angels.

313
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:34,442
Now, I think someone got to her,
Mr. Constantine.

314
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:38,405
I think they brainwashed her
into stepping off that roof.

315
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:43,034
Some kind of legion or cult.

316
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:46,162
Sounds like a theory, detective.

317
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,747
Good luck.

318
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:52,627
I thought with your background,
you could at least...

319
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:54,462
...point me in the right direction.

320
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,965
Yeah, okay, sure.

321
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,303
It wasn't a suicide.

322
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,639
My sister was a devout Catholic.

323
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:07,308
Do you understand that?
If she took her own life--

324
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:10,270
Her soul would go straight to hell...

325
00:37:10,437 --> 00:37:15,567
...where she'd be ripped apart over
and over in screaming, brutal agony...

326
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:18,987
...for all eternity. That it?

327
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:21,197
That about right?

328
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:30,290
Goddamn you.

329
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,113
Detective.

330
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,116
What if I told you that God
and the devil made a wager...

331
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:08,787
...a kind of standing bet
for the souls of all mankind?

332
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,456
I'd tell you to stay on your meds.

333
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:15,919
Humor me. No direct contact with
humans. That would be the rule.

334
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:20,465
-Just influence. See who would win.
-Okay, I'm humoring you.

335
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,717
-Why?
Who knows.

336
00:38:22,884 --> 00:38:25,970
-Maybe just for the fun of it. No telling.
-Oh, so it's fun.

337
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:31,142
It's fun when a man beats his wife to
death, when a mother drowns her baby.

338
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:35,063
And you think the devil is responsible?

339
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,982
People are evil, Mr. Constantine. People.

340
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:41,611
You're right. We're born
capable of terrible things.

341
00:38:41,778 --> 00:38:45,532
Then sometimes something else comes
along and gives us just the right nudge.

342
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:49,160
Well, this has been real educational...

343
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,037
...but I don't believe in the devil.

344
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:54,666
You should. He believes in you.

345
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:17,021
It's a power outage.

346
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:19,148
Not likely.

347
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:25,196
What?
-We should go. Now.

348
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,328
What is that?

349
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:35,164
Wings.

350
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:38,084
Maybe talons.

351
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:41,129
You're kidding. Of what?

352
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:45,133
Something that's not
supposed to be here.

353
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,681
That's really not going to help.

354
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:58,938
-Close your eyes.
Why?

355
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,440
Suit yourself.

356
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:26,090
Demons stay in hell, huh?

357
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,260
Tell them that.

358
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:36,517
Don't worry. Happens to everyone
the first time.

359
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,811
It's the sulfur.

360
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,397
Sulfur.

361
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:46,027
What were those things?

362
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,072
Demons.

363
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:55,286
-Scavengers of the damned.
-No, no. It's impossible.

364
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:59,248
Yeah. And I don't think
they were after me.

365
00:41:01,376 --> 00:41:04,420
You really believe
she wouldn't commit suicide.

366
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,005
Isabel?

367
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,883
Never in a million years.

368
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:11,344
Well, let's be sure.

369
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:14,055
Let's see if she's in hell.

370
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:40,707
Oh, was it supposed to be hot or cold?

371
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,334
In front of the chair.

372
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:48,047
I can't believe I'm doing this.

373
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:50,842
-These are all Isabel's things?
-Yeah.

374
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,886
-How about the cat?
-Duck?

375
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,681
Yeah, why?

376
00:41:57,724 --> 00:41:59,058
Duck.

377
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,561
Oh, you think that's strange.

378
00:42:01,728 --> 00:42:03,187
Cats are good.

379
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,981
Half in, half out anyway.

380
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:26,502
If this is some kind of spell
or something...

381
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:29,839
...don't you need candles
and a pentagram for it to work?

382
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:32,341
Why, do you have any?

383
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,595
-This is crazy.
-Yes.

384
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:41,476
I need you to leave.

385
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:45,146
-I'm sorry?
-Angela, please.

386
00:42:49,442 --> 00:42:51,444
The apartment.

387
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:55,281
Okay.

388
00:43:01,621 --> 00:43:03,623
Be careful with that cat.

389
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:11,005
God, I hate this part.

390
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:16,631
-Isabel.
-Constantine.

391
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,594
Angela.

392
00:46:07,056 --> 00:46:08,599
Jesus.

393
00:46:12,812 --> 00:46:14,563
-Constantine, what--?
-Twins.

394
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,649
Jesus. What?

395
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:20,069
-You were twins.
-What did you say?

396
00:46:20,236 --> 00:46:22,905
-She killed herself.
-What?

397
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,659
And she's damned for it.

398
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,382
How is this possible?

399
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:45,761
I need to eat.

400
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,996
Hey! Hey, what are you doing in here?

401
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:40,918
Relax, man.

402
00:48:41,502 --> 00:48:43,337
Slow down!

403
00:49:06,569 --> 00:49:09,488
What the hell kind of place is this?

404
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,874
John.

405
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:36,200
When I was a kid, I could see things.

406
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,744
Things humans aren't supposed to see.

407
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:43,207
Things you shouldn't have to see.

408
00:51:00,808 --> 00:51:05,104
My parents were normal.
They did what most parents would do.

409
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:07,773
They made it worse.

410
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:13,028
You think you're crazy long enough...

411
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:14,822
...you find a way out.

412
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:19,076
You tried to kill yourself.
/ didn't try anything.

413
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:25,958
Officially, I was dead for two minutes.

414
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:29,253
But when you cross over...

415
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:32,756
...time stops.

416
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:37,052
Take it from me,
two minutes in hell is a lifetime.

417
00:51:38,971 --> 00:51:41,265
When I came back...

418
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,977
...I knew...

419
00:51:45,311 --> 00:51:48,063
...all the things I could see were real.

420
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:54,528
Heaven and hell are right here.
Behind every wall, every window.

421
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:59,700
The world behind the world,
and we're smack in the middle.

422
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:03,412
Angels and demons can't
cross over onto our plane.

423
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:06,498
So instead we get
what I call half-breeds.

424
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,877
The influence peddlers.

425
00:52:10,044 --> 00:52:15,507
They can only whisper in our ears, but
a single word can give you courage...

426
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:19,720
...or turn your favorite pleasure
into your worst nightmare.

427
00:52:19,887 --> 00:52:22,931
Those with the demon's touch...

428
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:28,145
...like those part angel,
living alongside us.

429
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:30,814
They call it the balance.

430
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:34,360
I call it hypocritical bullshit.

431
00:52:35,903 --> 00:52:38,489
So when a half-breed
breaks the rules...

432
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:42,951
...I deport their sorry ass
straight back to hell.

433
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:46,205
I don't get them all...

434
00:52:47,373 --> 00:52:50,668
...but I've been hoping to get enough
to ensure my...

435
00:52:51,669 --> 00:52:54,672
-...retirement.
-I don't understand.

436
00:52:56,632 --> 00:52:58,842
I'm a suicide, Angela.

437
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:02,554
When I die, the rules say
I've got just one place to go.

438
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:04,765
You're trying to buy your way
into heaven.

439
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:07,476
What would you do
if you were sentenced to a prison...

440
00:53:07,643 --> 00:53:09,978
...where half the inmates
were put there by you?

441
00:53:12,356 --> 00:53:14,900
I guess God has a plan for all of us.

442
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:18,445
God's a kid with an ant farm, lady.

443
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:20,656
He's not planning anything.

444
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:23,033
When we were little...

445
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:26,620
...Isabel saw things too.

446
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:33,460
Dodson.

447
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:39,550
Guard spotted him groping
the body, then he ran across the street.

448
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:42,803
Came in here, and he had a go
at the entire stock.

449
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:46,223
He drowned himself in alcohol
in under a minute.

450
00:53:46,807 --> 00:53:49,435
Could've been a member
of my fraternity.

451
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,856
Hey, what the hell is he doing here?

452
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:55,649
He's okay.

453
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:08,746
Why didn't you call me,
you son of a bitch?

454
00:54:43,489 --> 00:54:45,115
Yes?

455
00:54:46,241 --> 00:54:47,910
What do you mean?

456
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:50,329
What?

457
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:52,039
How?

458
00:55:00,172 --> 00:55:01,965
Mm-hm.

459
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:06,678
Got it. Bye.

460
00:55:13,185 --> 00:55:16,188
I need to see where Isabel died.

461
00:55:16,355 --> 00:55:19,525
Séances, Ouija boards, channeling.

462
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:23,737
Our father thought she was
just trying to get attention.

463
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:26,448
She certainly did that.

464
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:30,160
She'd tell everyone about the things
she said she saw.

465
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:34,039
She'd scare my mother half to death.

466
00:55:35,833 --> 00:55:38,502
And then she stopped talking
for almost a year.

467
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:40,921
So you had her committed.

468
00:55:41,088 --> 00:55:42,422
Yeah.

469
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:44,258
How long?

470
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:46,343
Two weeks.

471
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:48,595
This time.

472
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:53,350
She'd get better, and then she'd
get worse. Recently, a lot worse.

473
00:55:55,352 --> 00:55:58,981
That symbol that was cut
in the dead guy's hand...

474
00:55:59,147 --> 00:56:01,441
...does it have something to do
with this?

475
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:04,027
I'm a cop, John, remember?

476
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:09,157
You don't walk off the roof of a building
without leaving something behind.

477
00:56:09,324 --> 00:56:14,204
And I showed you everything
she left behind in that box, but feel free.

478
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:19,710
Maybe she left something else.
Not something a cop would find.

479
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:23,046
Something just for you.

480
00:56:24,548 --> 00:56:28,760
You were her twin, Angela.
Twins tend to think alike.

481
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:32,264
-I'm not like my sister.
-But you were once.

482
00:56:32,431 --> 00:56:34,641
When you were kids.

483
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:37,728
When you'd spend every second
with each other.

484
00:56:37,895 --> 00:56:41,648
You'd start a sentence, she'd finish it.
You'd get hurt, she'd cry.

485
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:43,275
That was a long time ago.

486
00:56:43,442 --> 00:56:45,402
That kind of bond doesn't
just disappear.

487
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:47,654
There is nothing here.

488
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:51,408
-Hey. Come on.
-She planned her death in this room.

489
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:54,995
She thought it up right here.
Right where you're standing.

490
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:58,415
She knew you'd come. She counted
on you to see what she saw...

491
00:56:58,582 --> 00:57:01,627
...feel what she felt,
know what she knew.

492
00:57:02,002 --> 00:57:04,630
-What did she do, Angela?
-How should I know?

493
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:07,215
-What did she do, Angela?
-I don't know.

494
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:11,720
-What would you do?
-I don't know.

495
00:57:11,887 --> 00:57:16,642
What did she do, Angela? You know
what she did. What did she do, Angela?

496
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:20,103
You know what she did. What are
you afraid of? What did she do?

497
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,606
-What did she do?
-I don't know!

498
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,501
When we were girls...

499
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:48,298
...we would leave each other messages.

500
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:52,844
In light.

501
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:57,265
In breath.

502
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:03,146
On the windows.

503
00:58:06,775 --> 00:58:10,737
John, there is no 17th act
in Corinthians.

504
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:16,660
Corinthians goes to 21 acts
in the Bible in hell.

505
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:19,997
They have Bibles in hell.

506
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:23,041
Paints a different view of Revelations.

507
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:25,335
Says the world will not end
by God's hand...

508
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:28,505
...but be reborn in the embrace
of the damned.

509
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:30,173
Though if you ask me...

510
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:32,759
...fire's fire.

511
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:37,180
16:29, 16:30.

512
00:58:37,431 --> 00:58:41,393
Oh, my, this is certainly not good.

513
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:45,439
"The sins of the father would only
be exceeded by the sins of the son."

514
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:49,568
-Whose son?
-But he can't cross over, B.

515
00:58:49,735 --> 00:58:52,362
-Impossible to cross over.
-Whose son? God's son?

516
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:55,991
No, the other one. Devil had a son too.

517
00:58:56,283 --> 00:58:57,868
Here it is.

518
00:58:58,035 --> 00:59:00,078
This is the sign of Mammon...

519
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:03,206
...the son of the devil.
Well, hold on, it says here--

520
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,377
Beeman?
-Yeah.

521
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:10,547
Sorry, I'm--
I'm sorry, no, I'm right here.

522
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:17,304
It says Mammon has no patience
for his father's rule...

523
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:22,392
...and yearns to forge his own kingdom
of fire and blood.

524
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:30,734
Yeah. Mammon would be
the last demon...

525
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:33,779
...we'd ever want crossing over
to our plane.

526
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:37,574
No, wait, wait, wait. I'm reading.
Seems to be a loophole.

527
00:59:37,741 --> 00:59:40,077
Always a catch.

528
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:46,792
It says first Mammon would have to
possess a very, very powerful psychic.

529
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:49,586
-Isabel.
-But that wouldn't be enough.

530
00:59:50,337 --> 00:59:54,800
To cross over, Mammon would need
divine assistance.

531
00:59:56,218 --> 01:00:00,388
To cross over, Mammon would need
the help of God.

532
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:04,351
-The help of God?
-It says--

533
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:14,611
Beeman?
-John, look...

534
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:19,282
...I know you've never had much faith,
you've never had much reason to...

535
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:23,203
...but that doesn't mean
that we don't have faith...

536
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:25,831
...in you.

537
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:31,628
Beeman? Beeman?

538
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:34,673
Drive. Fast.

539
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:52,774
Beeman!

540
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:54,901
Sulfur.

541
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,988
Beeman!

542
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:03,869
Beeman!

543
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:16,149
Wasn't just Isabel.

544
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:18,985
I used to see things too.

545
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:22,739
But...

546
01:02:22,906 --> 01:02:26,785
-...you already knew that, didn't you?
-Go home, Angela.

547
01:02:26,952 --> 01:02:28,411
I need to understand.

548
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:31,081
You don't wanna know
what's out there, trust me.

549
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:33,333
I'm stronger than Isabel.

550
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:37,462
Your sister embraced her gift,
you denied yours. Denial is a better idea.

551
01:02:37,629 --> 01:02:42,425
It's why you're still alive.
Stick with me, that will change.

552
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,552
I don't need another ghost
following me.

553
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:47,264
John, they killed my sister.

554
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,937
I'd trade places with her if I could.

555
01:02:57,148 --> 01:02:59,776
I used to pretend that I didn't.

556
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:02,862
That I didn't see things.

557
01:03:03,238 --> 01:03:04,823
And...

558
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:10,287
...by the time we were 10,
they started forcing her to take...

559
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,123
...antipsychotics...

560
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:16,501
...and have treatments.
They would come for her...

561
01:03:16,668 --> 01:03:20,422
...and she'd look at me,
and she'd say to me, "Tell them.

562
01:03:20,588 --> 01:03:24,426
Why don't you tell them, Angie,
that you can see them too?"

563
01:03:25,593 --> 01:03:26,928
But I lied.

564
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,806
I said:

565
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:33,643
"I don't see anything."

566
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:36,813
Until one day...

567
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:39,399
...I finally stopped seeing.

568
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:44,321
I abandoned her, John.

569
01:03:45,155 --> 01:03:47,615
I left her all alone.

570
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:57,167
I need to see what she saw.

571
01:03:59,002 --> 01:04:00,712
Please.

572
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:08,803
You do this, there's no turning back.

573
01:04:10,764 --> 01:04:12,682
You see them...

574
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:15,518
...they see you.

575
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:18,396
Understand?

576
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:20,857
Yeah.

577
01:04:27,072 --> 01:04:28,865
Sure.

578
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:11,908
So do I have to take the rest of
my clothes off, or can I leave them on?

579
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:19,999
John?

580
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:22,252
I'm thinking.

581
01:05:26,256 --> 01:05:27,882
John?

582
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:30,552
On is fine.

583
01:05:43,231 --> 01:05:46,734
-So why water?
-It's a universal conduit.

584
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:50,947
Lubricates the transition
from one plane to another.

585
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:55,410
-Now ask me if there's water in hell.
-Is there water in hell?

586
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:58,663
Sit.

587
01:06:00,039 --> 01:06:04,294
Normally, only a portion of the body
has to be suspended...

588
01:06:06,963 --> 01:06:08,923
...but you wanted the crash course.

589
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:11,801
Yeah, I wanted the crash course.

590
01:06:12,010 --> 01:06:14,053
So, um....

591
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:16,514
So, what's gonna happen?

592
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:18,349
Lie down.

593
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:22,479
-What do you mean lie down?
-You have to be fully submerged.

594
01:06:24,564 --> 01:06:25,982
For how long?

595
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:28,443
As long as it takes.

596
01:06:38,578 --> 01:06:40,663
Take a deep one.

597
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:25,226
Oh, God.

598
01:08:25,893 --> 01:08:29,022
Oh, God, all those people.

599
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:32,066
Oh, Isabel.

600
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:33,860
I've always known.

601
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:38,573
I've always known where they are.
I've always known where to find them...

602
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:41,868
...where to aim and where to duck...

603
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:43,953
...and I've always known
where they were.

604
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,164
I've always known that it wasn't luck.

605
01:08:46,331 --> 01:08:48,958
Always known that it wasn't luck.
I've always known....

606
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:52,295
I've always known that I could see.

607
01:08:52,462 --> 01:08:57,800
I've always known that I could see.

608
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,432
Angela.

609
01:09:08,311 --> 01:09:10,647
Someone was here.

610
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:38,549
It was his.

611
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:41,719
Rolling.

612
01:09:43,805 --> 01:09:45,723
Not a ball.

613
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:49,352
Something smaller.

614
01:09:52,146 --> 01:09:53,773
Shiny.

615
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:28,850
Balthazar.

616
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:02,717
Sorry.

617
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:12,101
Can you just kill him?

618
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:14,395
What about the balance?

619
01:11:14,562 --> 01:11:18,232
Half-breed tipped the scales
when he started killing my friends.

620
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:20,860
I'm just adding some counterweight.

621
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:56,813
John, I really want--

622
01:12:02,902 --> 01:12:05,988
Think of it as a bulletproof vest.

623
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:15,706
Uh-uh. I'm coming with you.

624
01:12:17,041 --> 01:12:19,502
You're staying in the car.

625
01:12:43,818 --> 01:12:46,779
Fire? I was born of this.

626
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:51,492
How's Mammon crossing over,
you half-breed piece of shit?

627
01:12:55,496 --> 01:12:58,958
That's better. Au naturel.

628
01:13:06,090 --> 01:13:08,301
"Stay in the car."

629
01:13:08,467 --> 01:13:10,845
"Wait here."

630
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:12,889
Men.

631
01:13:26,611 --> 01:13:28,029
Don't fight it, Johnny boy.

632
01:13:29,614 --> 01:13:31,616
Enjoy it.

633
01:14:05,066 --> 01:14:08,861
We'll see you very soon.

634
01:14:09,278 --> 01:14:11,113
Not really, no.

635
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:16,452
You can't cheat it this time.
You're going back to hell.

636
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:18,120
True.

637
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:19,622
But you're not.

638
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:24,085
-What are you doing?
-I'm reading you your last rites.

639
01:14:24,251 --> 01:14:27,922
Spare me your remedial incantations.

640
01:14:28,089 --> 01:14:30,424
You do know what it is
to truly be forgiven?

641
01:14:30,591 --> 01:14:33,135
To be welcomed
into the Kingdom of God.

642
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:35,721
Demon in heaven.

643
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:39,350
I'd love to be a fly on that wall.

644
01:14:39,517 --> 01:14:43,771
You're not a priest. You have no power.

645
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:47,149
Just tell me how Mammon
is crossing over...

646
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:50,403
...and you can go back
to your shithole.

647
01:14:53,155 --> 01:14:56,617
Okay, Bally, enjoy it.

648
01:15:06,836 --> 01:15:11,716
"May God have mercy on you
and grant you the pardon of all your sins.

649
01:15:12,299 --> 01:15:16,721
Whose soever sins you remit on Earth,
they are remitted unto them in heaven."

650
01:15:18,889 --> 01:15:21,475
-How? How's he doing it?
-No.

651
01:15:21,642 --> 01:15:22,977
No, I can't.

652
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:28,190
Grant your child entry
into thy kingdom...

653
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:33,821
...in the name of the Father and the Son
and the Holy Spirit.

654
01:15:34,321 --> 01:15:35,614
Amen!

655
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:42,163
The blood of God.

656
01:15:42,329 --> 01:15:43,664
He found it.

657
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:48,085
Whatever killed the son of God...

658
01:15:48,252 --> 01:15:53,799
...will give birth to the son of the devil.

659
01:15:55,926 --> 01:15:57,762
By the way...

660
01:15:59,764 --> 01:16:03,684
...you have to ask for absolution
to be forgiven...

661
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,853
...asshole.

662
01:16:09,774 --> 01:16:13,235
My work here is done.

663
01:16:14,612 --> 01:16:19,450
-What are you laughing at?
-She was my only mission...

664
01:16:19,617 --> 01:16:23,829
...and you brought her right to us.

665
01:16:26,791 --> 01:16:30,127
So does this walking fast
mean you've found something?

666
01:16:30,294 --> 01:16:34,590
Jesus didn't die from being nailed to a
cross. He was killed by a soldier's spear.

667
01:16:34,757 --> 01:16:36,926
The Spear of Destiny.

668
01:16:37,343 --> 01:16:40,054
I'm a Catholic, John.
I know the Crucifixion story.

669
01:16:48,938 --> 01:16:53,776
I drew out the sister as you asked.

670
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:59,573
She's been made flush and ready.

671
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:03,494
So much power.

672
01:17:03,786 --> 01:17:08,999
Now, if you grant me my resurrection,
I shall serve.

673
01:17:11,585 --> 01:17:15,131
Wait. But I did as we agreed.

674
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:18,926
No. Please. No!

675
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:26,767
Beeman said Mammon needed
divine assistance to cross over.

676
01:17:27,768 --> 01:17:31,313
How's the blood of God's only son?

677
01:17:31,605 --> 01:17:33,983
The stains on the spear.

678
01:17:35,276 --> 01:17:38,154
-Yeah.
-So he gets the spear.

679
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:40,489
He still has to locate
a powerful psychic.

680
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:43,159
Not really.

681
01:17:46,245 --> 01:17:47,580
Twins.

682
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:51,167
Where's the amulet?

683
01:17:52,418 --> 01:17:55,504
I don't know,
I must have left it in the--

684
01:17:57,173 --> 01:17:58,507
What's wrong?

685
01:17:59,049 --> 01:18:00,759
I don't know, I just feel--

686
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:34,335
-Bird on a ladder.
Sorry.

687
01:18:39,924 --> 01:18:42,092
-Wait here.
-Yeah.

688
01:18:45,304 --> 01:18:48,224
Who's a rat in a dress now, huh, bitch?

689
01:19:02,196 --> 01:19:04,698
Have you lost what
little mind you have?

690
01:19:04,949 --> 01:19:06,533
Don't.

691
01:19:07,409 --> 01:19:10,162
I need to use the chair.

692
01:19:10,329 --> 01:19:14,375
I offer no aid to one side or the other.

693
01:19:15,376 --> 01:19:18,128
-The balance.
-Screw the balance.

694
01:19:24,218 --> 01:19:26,720
You dare? In my house?

695
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:32,893
Is this neutral? Bullshit.

696
01:19:33,102 --> 01:19:36,021
You're the only one still playing
by the rules, Midnite.

697
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:39,942
And while you've been imitating
Switzerland, people are dying.

698
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:44,530
Hennessy, Beeman, they were
your friends once too, remember?

699
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:48,325
I need your help!

700
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:52,997
Consider it a last request.

701
01:19:56,792 --> 01:19:59,628
You play a dangerous game.

702
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:08,804
Two-hundred-dollar shirt, by the way.

703
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:12,725
That little shit has been trying...

704
01:20:12,891 --> 01:20:15,477
...to climb out of his father's shadow
for eons.

705
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:20,566
I'd hate to think what he would do
to this world if he ever broke through.

706
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:26,030
Forgot how big it was.

707
01:20:26,405 --> 01:20:30,826
Two hundred souls passed
through this wood and steel at Sing Sing.

708
01:20:30,993 --> 01:20:32,661
Yeah.

709
01:20:35,873 --> 01:20:38,042
Which way's east?

710
01:20:55,851 --> 01:20:58,520
How many years since you've surfed?

711
01:20:59,772 --> 01:21:01,732
Like riding a bike.

712
01:21:01,899 --> 01:21:03,901
No, not really.

713
01:21:06,612 --> 01:21:09,406
Tell me this isn't about the girl.

714
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:14,953
Definitely mostly not about the girl.

715
01:21:21,335 --> 01:21:22,753
Cold.

716
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:25,047
Little flavor?

717
01:21:48,445 --> 01:21:50,447
-Sure about this?
-No.

718
01:22:40,622 --> 01:22:42,291
Midnite!

719
01:22:48,005 --> 01:22:51,133
-Any luck?
-That's a word for it.

720
01:22:51,467 --> 01:22:54,887
Holy shit. You're Papa Midnite,
aren't you?

721
01:23:02,644 --> 01:23:07,024
And how exactly do you intend
on getting close enough to use these?

722
01:23:09,109 --> 01:23:12,279
Well, they did not leave her unguarded.

723
01:23:12,446 --> 01:23:14,114
Half-breeds are most vulnerable...

724
01:23:14,281 --> 01:23:18,243
...when their outer skin is breached
by holy water.

725
01:23:18,702 --> 01:23:22,039
Certain objects, most notably
either of the two crosses of Isteria...

726
01:23:22,206 --> 01:23:24,708
...have been used by even
the unordained to bless...

727
01:23:24,875 --> 01:23:26,752
...commonly occurring waters...

728
01:23:26,919 --> 01:23:28,670
...even rain.

729
01:23:29,213 --> 01:23:30,589
Maybe if....

730
01:23:35,219 --> 01:23:38,680
There's no use sitting on the bench
if you're not ready to play, right?

731
01:23:38,847 --> 01:23:42,726
You wouldn't have one of those
enchanted crosses here in a cabinet...

732
01:23:42,893 --> 01:23:44,978
...maybe we could take with us?

733
01:23:45,187 --> 01:23:49,691
Look, John, no offense, I just don't think
that it's a great idea, you know...

734
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:53,195
...you going on a solo mission
to save the world. That's my vote.

735
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:56,031
I don't know what pops thinks,
but that's--

736
01:23:57,366 --> 01:24:00,410
Take him, John. Kill him after.

737
01:24:05,541 --> 01:24:09,836
If you get back, see me
about membership. Maybe.

738
01:24:10,003 --> 01:24:12,923
Okay. I will.

739
01:24:17,678 --> 01:24:19,972
-What are you doing?
-Praying.

740
01:24:20,138 --> 01:24:23,100
Praying. Okay.

741
01:24:24,017 --> 01:24:25,686
Come on.

742
01:25:22,701 --> 01:25:24,244
Half-breeds, right?

743
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:31,627
A birth like this, they're definitely
gonna be guarding her, right? Definitely.

744
01:25:32,044 --> 01:25:33,545
Yeah.

745
01:25:36,548 --> 01:25:41,053
We can get through them. I mean,
that cross has gotta work, right?

746
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:42,888
Right?

747
01:25:43,221 --> 01:25:46,600
It's not always like it is in the books.

748
01:26:34,981 --> 01:26:36,733
What is that?

749
01:26:37,234 --> 01:26:39,236
Hellspeak.

750
01:26:41,863 --> 01:26:43,949
You know what to do.

751
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:48,870
I'm okay.

752
01:26:50,706 --> 01:26:52,457
Sure.

753
01:27:04,261 --> 01:27:06,888
One last show.

754
01:27:40,797 --> 01:27:42,424
Hi.

755
01:27:43,008 --> 01:27:44,342
My name's John.

756
01:27:46,595 --> 01:27:50,098
You are in violation of the balance.

757
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:53,310
Leave immediately...

758
01:27:53,602 --> 01:27:56,271
...or I will deport you.

759
01:27:58,231 --> 01:28:00,066
All of you.

760
01:28:07,449 --> 01:28:09,367
Go to hell.

761
01:28:14,998 --> 01:28:16,458
Holy water?

762
01:29:34,160 --> 01:29:36,371
Angela.

763
01:30:08,069 --> 01:30:10,322
Uh, John?

764
01:30:12,616 --> 01:30:13,950
John.

765
01:30:19,706 --> 01:30:21,249
Shit.

766
01:30:46,608 --> 01:30:47,984
Pull!

767
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,235
Angela.

768
01:31:53,758 --> 01:31:55,885
Angela, what is it?

769
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:04,894
Get it out.

770
01:32:18,366 --> 01:32:19,909
Get it out.

771
01:32:20,493 --> 01:32:22,537
Get it--

772
01:33:06,498 --> 01:33:07,832
Oh, my God.

773
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:16,674
Not bad, kid.

774
01:33:19,677 --> 01:33:21,679
"Not bad." You hear that?

775
01:33:21,846 --> 01:33:26,267
You know why that is? It's because
this is Kramer. Chas Kramer, ass--

776
01:33:34,150 --> 01:33:36,069
Chas.

777
01:33:44,077 --> 01:33:46,663
You're right, John.

778
01:33:47,914 --> 01:33:49,624
It's not like the books.

779
01:33:50,792 --> 01:33:52,460
No...

780
01:33:53,378 --> 01:33:55,213
...itisn't.

781
01:34:16,151 --> 01:34:18,945
Into the light, I command thee.

782
01:34:19,988 --> 01:34:23,449
Into the light, I command thee.

783
01:34:24,576 --> 01:34:28,705
Into the light, I command thee.

784
01:34:33,251 --> 01:34:36,880
Into the light, I command thee.

785
01:34:40,091 --> 01:34:42,969
Your ego is astounding.

786
01:34:43,136 --> 01:34:44,929
Gabriel.

787
01:34:45,096 --> 01:34:46,431
Figures.

788
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:51,060
And the wicked shall inherit the Earth.

789
01:34:51,227 --> 01:34:53,646
You judging me now, John?

790
01:34:54,898 --> 01:34:58,902
Betrayal, murder, genocide,
call me provincial.

791
01:34:59,068 --> 01:35:03,031
I am simply seeking to inspire mankind
to all that was intended.

792
01:35:03,448 --> 01:35:07,118
By handing Earth over
to the son of the devil?

793
01:35:07,827 --> 01:35:09,162
Help me here.

794
01:35:13,208 --> 01:35:17,503
You're handed this precious gift, right?

795
01:35:18,713 --> 01:35:22,759
Each one of you granted redemption
from the Creator.

796
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:26,304
Murderers, rapists and molesters...

797
01:35:26,471 --> 01:35:28,806
...all of you, you just have to repent...

798
01:35:28,973 --> 01:35:31,809
...and God takes you into his bosom.

799
01:35:34,145 --> 01:35:36,397
In all the worlds in all the universe...

800
01:35:36,564 --> 01:35:39,484
...no other creature can make
such a boast, save man.

801
01:35:41,945 --> 01:35:43,279
It's not fair.

802
01:35:47,450 --> 01:35:51,412
If sweet, sweet God loves you so...

803
01:35:51,579 --> 01:35:54,582
...then I'll make you worthy of his love.

804
01:35:56,251 --> 01:35:59,379
I've been watching you for a long time.

805
01:35:59,545 --> 01:36:04,217
It's only in the face of horror
that you truly find your nobler selves.

806
01:36:04,384 --> 01:36:08,221
And you can be so noble.

807
01:36:10,932 --> 01:36:12,517
So...

808
01:36:13,184 --> 01:36:15,520
...I'll bring you pain.

809
01:36:16,187 --> 01:36:18,564
I'll bring you horror.

810
01:36:20,275 --> 01:36:23,361
So that you may rise above it.

811
01:36:26,823 --> 01:36:30,743
So that those of you who survive
this reign of hell on Earth...

812
01:36:30,910 --> 01:36:33,871
...will be worthy of God's love.

813
01:36:34,038 --> 01:36:35,832
Gabriel...

814
01:36:36,291 --> 01:36:38,543
...you're insane.

815
01:36:40,461 --> 01:36:43,673
The road to salvation begins tonight.

816
01:36:44,465 --> 01:36:46,175
Right now.

817
01:37:27,842 --> 01:37:30,845
I know I'm not one of your favorites.

818
01:37:32,388 --> 01:37:35,141
I'm not even welcome in your house.

819
01:37:36,726 --> 01:37:39,562
But I could use a little attention.

820
01:37:42,857 --> 01:37:44,567
Please.

821
01:38:30,947 --> 01:38:33,324
Come forth.

822
01:38:53,094 --> 01:38:54,971
Hurry.

823
01:39:12,196 --> 01:39:14,073
Mammon...

824
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:16,701
...son of Satan...

825
01:39:16,868 --> 01:39:21,330
...I unleash you unto this world.

826
01:40:15,092 --> 01:40:16,427
Hello.

827
01:40:16,594 --> 01:40:18,679
What took you so long?

828
01:40:18,846 --> 01:40:21,140
Hello, John.

829
01:40:21,849 --> 01:40:25,186
John, hello.

830
01:40:30,024 --> 01:40:32,985
You're the one soul...

831
01:40:33,361 --> 01:40:38,032
...I would come up here
to collect myself. Mm-hm.

832
01:40:40,326 --> 01:40:42,703
So I've heard.

833
01:40:43,454 --> 01:40:44,789
You mind?

834
01:40:45,831 --> 01:40:48,209
Oh, go-- Go right ahead. I've got stock.

835
01:40:49,210 --> 01:40:50,628
Coffin nail.

836
01:40:51,128 --> 01:40:53,005
Very fitting, John.

837
01:40:55,883 --> 01:40:59,428
You know, when you cut too deep,
you cut the tendons...

838
01:40:59,595 --> 01:41:02,390
...finger movement goes
out the window.

839
01:41:02,557 --> 01:41:04,642
Let me help you.

840
01:41:16,028 --> 01:41:17,613
See?

841
01:41:19,448 --> 01:41:20,866
Sonny...

842
01:41:21,033 --> 01:41:26,163
...I've got a whole theme park
full of red delights for you.

843
01:41:26,914 --> 01:41:28,457
Well, aren't you a peach.

844
01:41:30,251 --> 01:41:34,088
I didn't think you would
make the same mistake twice.

845
01:41:38,926 --> 01:41:40,886
And you didn't...

846
01:41:41,637 --> 01:41:43,389
...did you?

847
01:41:43,681 --> 01:41:45,308
So how's the family?

848
01:41:45,474 --> 01:41:51,439
Family's doing just fine.
Busy, busy, busy. Need a vacation.

849
01:41:51,772 --> 01:41:55,276
Word is that kid of yours
is a chip off the old block.

850
01:41:55,443 --> 01:41:58,487
Well, one does what one can.

851
01:41:58,654 --> 01:42:00,281
He's in the other room.

852
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:03,242
Boys will be boys.

853
01:42:04,452 --> 01:42:05,786
With Gabriel.

854
01:42:08,623 --> 01:42:11,417
No accounting for taste, really.

855
01:42:11,792 --> 01:42:14,211
They have the Spear of Destiny.

856
01:42:16,964 --> 01:42:20,676
"They have the Spear of Destiny."

857
01:42:28,976 --> 01:42:32,188
Or is it another one of your cons?

858
01:42:34,273 --> 01:42:36,567
Go look for yourself.

859
01:42:39,612 --> 01:42:43,240
You've waited 20 years for me, Lu...

860
01:42:43,616 --> 01:42:46,661
...what's another 20 seconds?

861
01:43:51,392 --> 01:43:56,605
-Lucifer.
-This world is mine. In time.

862
01:43:56,772 --> 01:43:59,358
You, best of all of us, Gabriel...

863
01:43:59,525 --> 01:44:04,739
...should understand ambition.

864
01:44:04,905 --> 01:44:07,408
Son of perdition.

865
01:44:08,284 --> 01:44:09,618
Little horn.

866
01:44:11,746 --> 01:44:13,956
Most unclean.

867
01:44:14,123 --> 01:44:16,751
I do miss the old names.

868
01:44:17,626 --> 01:44:19,837
Time to go home, son.

869
01:44:20,004 --> 01:44:22,465
I will smite thee...

870
01:44:22,631 --> 01:44:25,551
...in his honor.

871
01:44:30,681 --> 01:44:35,811
Looks like somebody doesn't
have your back anymore.

872
01:44:53,621 --> 01:44:55,456
Father?

873
01:45:18,854 --> 01:45:20,272
So.

874
01:45:27,279 --> 01:45:28,614
So.

875
01:45:28,989 --> 01:45:32,743
Yeah, what do you want? An extension?

876
01:45:37,498 --> 01:45:39,500
The sister...

877
01:45:40,417 --> 01:45:41,752
...Isabel.

878
01:45:43,671 --> 01:45:45,589
What about her?

879
01:45:47,591 --> 01:45:50,010
Let her go home.

880
01:45:52,721 --> 01:45:57,309
You're willing to give up your life
so she can go to heaven?

881
01:46:07,111 --> 01:46:10,155
Fine. It's done.

882
01:46:12,783 --> 01:46:16,245
Time to go, John.

883
01:46:16,579 --> 01:46:18,205
Yeah.

884
01:47:16,055 --> 01:47:18,057
The sacrifice.

885
01:47:29,652 --> 01:47:35,658
No. This one belongs to me.

886
01:47:45,626 --> 01:47:51,465
No. You will live, John Constantine.

887
01:47:54,551 --> 01:47:55,970
You will live.

888
01:47:58,555 --> 01:48:01,016
So you will have...

889
01:48:02,726 --> 01:48:05,354
...the chance to prove...

890
01:48:07,982 --> 01:48:13,362
...that your soul truly belongs in hell.

891
01:48:16,407 --> 01:48:19,493
Oh, you will live.

892
01:48:23,831 --> 01:48:27,626
You will live.

893
01:49:41,492 --> 01:49:43,494
Thank you.

894
01:49:45,913 --> 01:49:47,873
No problem.

895
01:50:03,931 --> 01:50:05,682
Human.

896
01:50:07,601 --> 01:50:10,145
You don't deserve to be human.

897
01:50:11,647 --> 01:50:16,360
Do you want revenge?
Is that what you're thinking right now?

898
01:50:18,821 --> 01:50:20,405
Do it.

899
01:50:21,698 --> 01:50:23,242
Do it.

900
01:50:24,785 --> 01:50:26,954
Seek revenge.

901
01:50:27,121 --> 01:50:29,414
End my life.

902
01:50:30,124 --> 01:50:31,667
Go on.

903
01:50:33,794 --> 01:50:35,295
Be the hand of God.

904
01:50:35,462 --> 01:50:37,840
It's your choice.

905
01:50:38,006 --> 01:50:40,259
It's always been your choice.

906
01:50:45,556 --> 01:50:46,974
Yeah.

907
01:50:52,646 --> 01:50:55,023
That's called pain.

908
01:50:55,190 --> 01:50:56,567
Get used to it.

909
01:51:02,990 --> 01:51:05,159
You could've shot me, John!

910
01:51:07,286 --> 01:51:10,164
You chose a higher path!

911
01:51:11,582 --> 01:51:14,376
Look how well you're doing!

912
01:51:39,902 --> 01:51:41,945
Nice spot.

913
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:47,701
I have something for you.

914
01:51:50,746 --> 01:51:53,498
Something tells me
you're not a flowers kind of guy.

915
01:51:56,543 --> 01:51:59,087
Oh, how thoughtful.

916
01:52:04,384 --> 01:52:06,220
John...

917
01:52:07,679 --> 01:52:09,973
...why are you giving me this?

918
01:52:10,140 --> 01:52:11,600
Rules.

919
01:52:11,892 --> 01:52:13,393
Hide it.

920
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:16,605
Somewhere no one
will ever be able to find it.

921
01:52:17,648 --> 01:52:19,316
Not even me.

922
01:52:19,483 --> 01:52:20,817
Ah.

923
01:52:23,487 --> 01:52:25,280
Always a catch.

924
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:28,325
Yeah.

925
01:52:41,421 --> 01:52:43,257
So.

926
01:52:44,883 --> 01:52:47,928
I've got some cleaning up to do.

927
01:52:53,934 --> 01:52:56,228
...See you around.

928
01:52:58,730 --> 01:53:00,649
I'd like that.

929
01:53:30,637 --> 01:53:33,515
I guess there's a plan for all of us.

930
01:53:33,682 --> 01:53:35,267
I had to die...

931
01:53:35,434 --> 01:53:36,768
...twice...

932
01:53:36,935 --> 01:53:39,146
...just to figure that out.

933
01:53:39,313 --> 01:53:44,318
Like the book says, he works his work
in mysterious ways.

934
01:53:44,484 --> 01:53:46,653
Some people like it...

935
01:53:46,820 --> 01:53:49,364
...some people don't.

936
01:59:42,759 --> 01:59:44,886
You did good, kid.

937
02:00:41,109 --> 02:00:43,111
