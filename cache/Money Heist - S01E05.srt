1
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,327
I need authorization. I don't see.

2
00:00:08,845 --> 00:00:09,752
What have you done?

3
00:00:10,002 --> 00:00:11,594
Tell me what happened to Monica

4
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:12,872
What the fuck have you done?

5
00:00:12,897 --> 00:00:13,655
They're pointing at each other.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:16,230
- Give me the green light.
- They're going to execute them, sir.

7
00:00:16,255 --> 00:00:17,736
You fucking assholes, tell me!

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,532
Get down!

9
00:00:18,683 --> 00:00:20,091
- Get down now!
- They're going to kill them.

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,059
Do it, then.

11
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,712
Condor 3, open fire.

12
00:00:25,002 --> 00:00:25,916
Arturo!

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,680
<font color="#b20000">SATURDAY
6:00 PM</font>

14
00:01:52,658 --> 00:01:55,669
Yes! Great work, Torres. Pure perfection.

15
00:01:55,942 --> 00:01:58,037
Now we're changing the series.

16
00:01:58,062 --> 00:01:59,920
As well as the lettering, got it?

17
00:02:00,382 --> 00:02:02,080
Another country, ok?
So get on it.

18
00:02:07,581 --> 00:02:09,800
Come on, hurry up. Move it.

19
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,440
Get ahead of me.
Come on quickly, let's go.

20
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,851
Filthy sons of bitches!

21
00:02:15,837 --> 00:02:17,620
Come on, let's go. Quickly.

22
00:02:58,974 --> 00:02:59,800
Easy.

23
00:03:10,605 --> 00:03:11,581
Water.

24
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,480
Water, please. Water.

25
00:03:23,856 --> 00:03:24,811
Arturo, wait.

26
00:03:26,317 --> 00:03:27,680
Don't give him any more water.

27
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,957
Take your hand away.

28
00:03:29,657 --> 00:03:31,018
Alright. Here we go.

29
00:03:31,996 --> 00:03:32,615
Raquel.

30
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,253
We have breaking news to report.

31
00:03:34,278 --> 00:03:36,054
We have just learned
the identity of the man

32
00:03:36,078 --> 00:03:38,120
who was shot and
wounded by the police.

33
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,956
He is Arturo Román,

34
00:03:39,981 --> 00:03:42,963
director of operations where
the situatiuon has been unfolding.

35
00:03:43,684 --> 00:03:45,536
Román was wounded
by a police sniper

36
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,368
while he was on the roof
with the attackers.

37
00:03:48,098 --> 00:03:50,923
The incident occurred 32 hours
after the standoff began.

38
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,200
<font color="#b20000">32 HOURS INTO ROBBERY</font>

39
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,296
I need to talk to my wife right away.

40
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,480
I have to see her. Please let me.

41
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,763
They say that when we
stand at the threshold of Death

42
00:04:06,177 --> 00:04:08,280
we can finally see
our lives clearly.

43
00:04:09,107 --> 00:04:11,929
As Arturo Román laid
bleeding out on the table,

44
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,200
he waited for the
clarity of death

45
00:04:14,225 --> 00:04:16,770
to reveal to him who the
true love of his life was.

46
00:04:17,378 --> 00:04:18,972
What would the answer be?

47
00:04:21,849 --> 00:04:22,829
Would it be Laura,

48
00:04:23,008 --> 00:04:25,614
his loving and devoted
wife of 14 years?

49
00:04:27,353 --> 00:04:28,256
Or Mónica,

50
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:32,036
his secretary and lover, who made
him feel like a young man again?

51
00:04:33,005 --> 00:04:35,868
Sadly, the only
certainty for Arturo

52
00:04:35,893 --> 00:04:37,760
is that we'll either
dig the bullet out,

53
00:04:38,315 --> 00:04:41,283
or he'll die before finding
the answer to his question

54
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,256
And frankly,

55
00:04:42,748 --> 00:04:46,597
our minimal amount of medical training
offers little hope for his survival.

56
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,080
Inferior vein,

57
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,869
both of the kidneys, the
right one and the left one.

58
00:04:52,776 --> 00:04:54,237
Mesenteric organ.

59
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,127
Then we have the lungs.

60
00:04:56,233 --> 00:04:57,525
The right one and the left.

61
00:04:58,675 --> 00:05:00,467
From the heart, we have the veins.

62
00:05:01,435 --> 00:05:04,981
Subclavian, right and left.

63
00:05:06,241 --> 00:05:07,241
Brachial.

64
00:05:07,652 --> 00:05:08,436
Humeral.

65
00:05:10,924 --> 00:05:12,380
Internal jugular.

66
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:15,158
And external jugular.

67
00:05:16,027 --> 00:05:17,802
Red lines are main arteries.

68
00:05:18,008 --> 00:05:19,323
Hold on a minute. Wait, wait.

69
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,774
You want us...

70
00:05:21,476 --> 00:05:24,040
to learn basic surgery
skills with some markers?

71
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,972
If someone gets shot,
you don't go to the hospital.

72
00:05:27,011 --> 00:05:28,299
You handle it yourselves.

73
00:05:28,877 --> 00:05:30,735
- This is suicide.
- Son, that's enough.

74
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,927
Being confined in that
mouse trap is one thing.

75
00:05:33,326 --> 00:05:34,920
- Getting killed is another.
- Denver.

76
00:05:35,476 --> 00:05:37,720
He's just teaching you
how to remove a bullet.

77
00:05:38,654 --> 00:05:40,416
you're not learning brain surgery.

78
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,283
- It's not that hard, really.
- Yeah, no big deal.

79
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:44,742
You just gotta take the pliers,
get the bullet and take it out.

80
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:46,172
Hey, if I end up taking a bullet...

81
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,365
please rush me to a
hospital and a real doctor.

82
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,760
Yeah, and then to jail.

83
00:05:49,987 --> 00:05:52,033
I'd rather be free without legs

84
00:05:52,383 --> 00:05:54,311
than be in jail and healthy.

85
00:05:54,336 --> 00:05:55,336
No one gets out.

86
00:05:56,232 --> 00:05:57,889
We act as a single unit

87
00:05:57,914 --> 00:06:00,552
and if anyone wants to walk away,
then now is the moment.

88
00:06:01,408 --> 00:06:03,449
You'll stay inside
for as long as it takes.

89
00:06:06,453 --> 00:06:07,520
So, we done?

90
00:06:08,529 --> 00:06:11,061
I'm cold and shriveled
up, like Helsinki's dick.

91
00:06:11,282 --> 00:06:12,884
Our dick's bigger than you are.

92
00:06:15,702 --> 00:06:17,136
That's enough everyone.

93
00:06:17,256 --> 00:06:18,846
- Really.
- Please.

94
00:06:18,993 --> 00:06:20,498
- I bet it's tiny.
- Get dressed.

95
00:06:20,857 --> 00:06:21,859
Someone else now.

96
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:23,513
- Fuck you.
- Pull it out.

97
00:06:23,538 --> 00:06:24,480
Come on.

98
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:24,888
No?

99
00:06:25,571 --> 00:06:27,657
-  No, no, no...
- Coward.

100
00:06:27,682 --> 00:06:29,775
- At last. This is worth watching.
- Do it, Nairobi.

101
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,905
- It's no big deal.
- Look at this hottie!

102
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,715
What a sexy lady.

103
00:06:35,074 --> 00:06:36,760
Very sexy.

104
00:06:37,194 --> 00:06:38,237
- Your turn.
- Oh!

105
00:06:38,417 --> 00:06:39,511
Let's see what you've learned.

106
00:06:40,202 --> 00:06:42,435
Well, this is the carotid artery...

107
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,149
"I realized that as we played doctor."

108
00:06:45,547 --> 00:06:48,223
"There was much more to
Nairobi than met the eye."

109
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,556
The heart is right here.

110
00:06:51,142 --> 00:06:52,222
The aorta...

111
00:06:52,808 --> 00:06:54,708
"Even though none of
us knew each other..."

112
00:06:54,739 --> 00:06:55,558
The abdominal...

113
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:58,080
"I would not have guessed
that Nairobi had given birth."

114
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,436
"She had a scar along her belly."

115
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,916
"It was evidence of a C-section."

116
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,577
- Get out of there.
- Okay, okay!

117
00:07:04,602 --> 00:07:06,575
What the hell do you
think you are doing, huh?

118
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,142
What's wrong?

119
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,493
- What were you looking for?
- Why? What happened?

120
00:07:08,518 --> 00:07:10,040
- Nothing.
- No. You're a perv, that's what.

121
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:11,925
- Hey. Hey.
- She tried to get between my legs.

122
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,038
I'll shove that marker
up your ass, you bitch.

123
00:07:14,063 --> 00:07:17,140
From what I saw, I'm pretty sure
nobody would want what's down there.

124
00:07:20,975 --> 00:07:22,960
"That's where our friendship began."

125
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,729
I have them on the phone.

126
00:08:42,057 --> 00:08:43,444
What should I tell them, Raquel?

127
00:08:43,854 --> 00:08:45,160
- Raquel! They're holding.
- What?

128
00:08:45,411 --> 00:08:47,477
They'll ask who gave
the order to take the shot.

129
00:08:47,501 --> 00:08:48,460
I gave the order.

130
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,277
Just say... the hostage was wounded.

131
00:08:52,462 --> 00:08:53,475
Hang up the damn phone!

132
00:08:54,057 --> 00:08:55,400
I asked for the green light.

133
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,160
He looked like one
of them. I insisted.

134
00:08:57,577 --> 00:09:00,197
Inspector, I'll share the
responsibility for this.

135
00:09:00,921 --> 00:09:02,989
Inspector, the ambulance is here.

136
00:09:03,631 --> 00:09:05,032
I'm ready to talk with him now.

137
00:09:06,927 --> 00:09:08,667
Now patching through
the call to the kidnapper.

138
00:09:08,692 --> 00:09:11,098
Can you explain to
me how this happened?

139
00:09:11,137 --> 00:09:12,817
We were forced to
make a tough choice.

140
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,262
It looked like they were
gonna start shooting

141
00:09:15,286 --> 00:09:16,628
and we had no
time to deliberate.

142
00:09:16,653 --> 00:09:17,739
Silence, please!

143
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,587
Professor?

144
00:09:47,569 --> 00:09:48,819
You shot a hostage.

145
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,156
He's in danger of dying.
I suppose that's why you called.

146
00:09:52,615 --> 00:09:54,419
We have an
ambulance ready to go.

147
00:09:54,555 --> 00:09:55,715
No one leaves here.

148
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,738
- That man is bleeding out.
- From a bullet shot by one of yours.

149
00:10:00,581 --> 00:10:01,732
You would let him die?

150
00:10:04,422 --> 00:10:06,249
Let us at least send
in a medical team.

151
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,680
Professor, I'm...

152
00:10:13,756 --> 00:10:15,076
aware it's my fault.

153
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,328
It was my mistake,
and mine alone.

154
00:10:18,352 --> 00:10:20,204
But if one of the hostages dies,

155
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,116
things will go very
badly for both of us.

156
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:25,468
The public will immediately
think that he died

157
00:10:25,668 --> 00:10:29,000
because neither of us gave enough
of a damn to save the man's life.

158
00:10:41,501 --> 00:10:43,883
Two surgeons and a nurse
with surgical tools.

159
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,560
- Let me know when you're here.
- Thank you.

160
00:10:47,107 --> 00:10:48,760
Also, the man has a request.

161
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:51,650
He'd like to talk to his wife.

162
00:10:52,431 --> 00:10:53,400
Of course. I...

163
00:10:56,664 --> 00:10:58,160
Find Mr Román's wife.

164
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,811
How soon could a
medical team get here?

165
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,435
If we fly them in from La Paz,
20 minutes or so.

166
00:11:04,028 --> 00:11:05,871
- Get them. Now!
- Alright.

167
00:12:10,006 --> 00:12:10,920
Excuse me.

168
00:12:11,752 --> 00:12:12,652
Can you drive?

169
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:14,388
Yes, yes.

170
00:12:14,413 --> 00:12:15,684
I need to get out of here, now.

171
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:17,459
- Sure.
- Thank you.

172
00:12:22,722 --> 00:12:24,111
Raquel. Hey.

173
00:12:25,131 --> 00:12:25,819
What's wrong?

174
00:12:27,098 --> 00:12:28,000
I have to think.

175
00:12:40,219 --> 00:12:41,119
Let's go.

176
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,075
Don't look at me like that.
I'm not leaving you alone.

177
00:13:14,432 --> 00:13:15,693
Where the hell is she?

178
00:13:17,034 --> 00:13:18,721
God damn bitch has bolted!

179
00:13:27,312 --> 00:13:28,472
There we go.

180
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,750
All right.

181
00:13:32,461 --> 00:13:33,861
Answer the phone.

182
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,652
Hello, darling.

183
00:13:40,915 --> 00:13:42,280
Are you coming home tonight?

184
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,773
I don't know, mom.

185
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:45,459
What's the matter?

186
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,329
Mum...

187
00:13:50,604 --> 00:13:51,320
I made...

188
00:13:52,286 --> 00:13:53,624
a huge mistake at work.

189
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:57,760
Well, it's not like you don't
have a difficult job, darling.

190
00:13:58,594 --> 00:14:00,483
Listen. Why don't you
tell me what happened.

191
00:14:00,508 --> 00:14:03,293
Things don't seem as bad as
they are, if you talk about them.

192
00:14:04,842 --> 00:14:05,364
I was um...

193
00:14:06,294 --> 00:14:07,207
drinking wine with...

194
00:14:07,294 --> 00:14:07,792
with...

195
00:14:08,202 --> 00:14:09,228
Oh, you had a date.

196
00:14:09,253 --> 00:14:10,528
Is he someone I know?

197
00:14:10,996 --> 00:14:13,425
No, mom. Even I
don't know who he is.

198
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:15,597
What happened was...

199
00:14:16,444 --> 00:14:18,771
When I returned to the command post,

200
00:14:18,861 --> 00:14:19,386
there was

201
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:22,713
a high risk situation
on the factory's roof

202
00:14:24,023 --> 00:14:26,677
and I felt that the
hostages were in danger

203
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:28,967
I gave the order to shoot.

204
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,240
And because of that
order, a hostage was shot.

205
00:14:32,277 --> 00:14:34,790
Yes. I saw that
on the television.

206
00:14:35,243 --> 00:14:36,709
I don't know what to do now.

207
00:14:37,429 --> 00:14:39,622
Should I call his wife,

208
00:14:40,191 --> 00:14:40,757
Or...

209
00:14:41,304 --> 00:14:43,086
should I issue a
press release, or quit.

210
00:14:43,462 --> 00:14:44,444
I don't know what to do, mom.

211
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,085
Blaming yourself is really the last
thing you should ever do, sweetheart.

212
00:14:48,485 --> 00:14:51,600
I mean, weren't those people all
wearing masks and holding guns?

213
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:53,798
It had to be confusing for you.

214
00:14:54,364 --> 00:14:56,678
You were looking
out for the hostages,

215
00:14:56,702 --> 00:14:57,482
isn't that right?

216
00:14:58,353 --> 00:15:00,562
And... what if you had saved
someone's life?"

217
00:15:00,821 --> 00:15:02,686
Then, I doubt you'd
even be having

218
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,876
this conversation with
your mother right now.

219
00:15:05,018 --> 00:15:07,172
But, there was an upside to this.

220
00:15:07,997 --> 00:15:09,989
I learnt something new about my daughter.

221
00:15:10,014 --> 00:15:12,215
She's finally starting
to meet other men.

222
00:15:13,555 --> 00:15:14,332
Good God!

223
00:15:15,011 --> 00:15:16,408
Can we not talk about this?

224
00:15:17,672 --> 00:15:20,568
Darling, we have a
short time in this world...

225
00:15:22,034 --> 00:15:23,213
Yeah, mom. I know. But...

226
00:15:23,358 --> 00:15:24,589
That's not the issue here.

227
00:15:24,614 --> 00:15:26,801
The issue is that I'm in a
really tough position at work.

228
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:28,834
Then screw your job. Go forward.

229
00:15:29,381 --> 00:15:32,251
Just tell them you want to
stamp passports instead.

230
00:15:32,276 --> 00:15:35,117
Then you can enjoy life,
instead of stressing about this.

231
00:15:35,171 --> 00:15:37,115
Do you want to end up in a retirement home

232
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:39,160
still obsessing over this case?

233
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,326
But...

234
00:15:40,923 --> 00:15:42,952
what about that stranger, hmm...

235
00:15:44,976 --> 00:15:47,721
Go ahead and laugh, I
know what I'm talking about.

236
00:15:48,124 --> 00:15:50,427
I've been a widow for 20 years.

237
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:52,361
but...

238
00:15:53,171 --> 00:15:54,760
Time always moves on.

239
00:15:56,065 --> 00:15:57,635
If only we could turn it back.

240
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,391
We're entering the perimeter.

241
00:16:00,197 --> 00:16:01,146
I'll think about it, mom.

242
00:16:02,516 --> 00:16:04,160
If I'm not home early,
go to bed, alright?

243
00:16:04,437 --> 00:16:05,082
Fine.

244
00:16:05,811 --> 00:16:07,837
You should sleep with
someone too, you know.

245
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,000
RACHEL LIKES A STRANGER

246
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,845
Well, look who it is?

247
00:16:34,111 --> 00:16:35,800
I saw your stomach scar.

248
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:36,555
and...

249
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,407
I was nosy.

250
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,020
I didn't know what it was.

251
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,264
Sorry.

252
00:16:42,965 --> 00:16:44,720
Fine. You're forgiven.

253
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,166
Okay. Now, go away.

254
00:16:53,343 --> 00:16:54,051
What the hell?

255
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:56,439
Get out!
I don't want company!

256
00:17:07,481 --> 00:17:08,444
So, how old?

257
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:10,579
Your kid.

258
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:16,326
Seven.

259
00:17:18,023 --> 00:17:18,688
He's seven.

260
00:17:19,817 --> 00:17:20,533
Who's he with?

261
00:17:21,216 --> 00:17:21,957
The boy's dad?

262
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,120
With the dad? Yeah, right.
No. He's not with his father.

263
00:17:25,719 --> 00:17:26,695
That guy is long gone.

264
00:17:33,565 --> 00:17:34,308
What's his name?

265
00:17:37,436 --> 00:17:38,133
Axel.

266
00:17:39,781 --> 00:17:41,160
His name's Axel.

267
00:17:42,903 --> 00:17:44,289
You know, like an axe.

268
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:45,501
Axe.

269
00:17:45,993 --> 00:17:46,548
Yeah.

270
00:17:47,863 --> 00:17:49,040
Fits him, too.

271
00:17:49,955 --> 00:17:50,698
Like his mother.

272
00:17:55,371 --> 00:17:57,094
That kid is a survivor, you know?

273
00:17:57,984 --> 00:17:58,884
He's gone through a lot.

274
00:18:00,175 --> 00:18:02,879
He's like a cork on the sea,
defying the water.

275
00:18:03,386 --> 00:18:04,201
he won't sink.

276
00:18:06,281 --> 00:18:06,926
He's strong.

277
00:18:09,274 --> 00:18:10,221
He was three years old.

278
00:18:11,192 --> 00:18:12,746
We'd been living at
my mother's place.

279
00:18:13,714 --> 00:18:14,482
We left, though.

280
00:18:15,872 --> 00:18:17,669
Her husband, when I was out,

281
00:18:17,694 --> 00:18:19,058
would give the boy some alcohol.

282
00:18:19,913 --> 00:18:21,880
He couldn't stand
my son's crying.

283
00:18:22,469 --> 00:18:24,564
So, I took Axel away. Just him and me.

284
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:26,875
No one else.

285
00:18:28,551 --> 00:18:30,438
Us two. We did great by ourselves.

286
00:18:33,092 --> 00:18:33,717
But...

287
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:36,827
I fucked up.

288
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:44,858
One day...

289
00:18:47,408 --> 00:18:49,623
I went to make
a sale... of pills.

290
00:18:51,379 --> 00:18:51,879
And...

291
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:54,915
He was alone.

292
00:18:58,567 --> 00:18:59,489
Just five minutes.

293
00:19:00,042 --> 00:19:01,520
I was only gone five minutes.

294
00:19:02,534 --> 00:19:03,335
That's all it took.

295
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,713
He was getting into mischief,

296
00:19:05,738 --> 00:19:07,758
always pretending
that he was Spider-Man!

297
00:19:10,222 --> 00:19:11,984
It's why I hate Spider-Man today.

298
00:19:13,702 --> 00:19:16,187
Axel was always having
fun as a superhero.

299
00:19:20,472 --> 00:19:22,000
He would climb on everything.

300
00:19:22,719 --> 00:19:24,003
Especially, when
you weren't looking.

301
00:19:28,188 --> 00:19:30,360
He stood on a chair and then began yelling.

302
00:19:31,024 --> 00:19:32,240
He screamed: "Mommy!"

303
00:19:32,453 --> 00:19:33,487
"Mommy!"

304
00:19:35,506 --> 00:19:36,576
He was three and a half.

305
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,045
Well, it was reported, so...

306
00:19:41,738 --> 00:19:44,779
Then all the cops,
firemen, EMTs in the area...

307
00:19:45,251 --> 00:19:46,489
arrived in a hurry.

308
00:19:47,926 --> 00:19:48,527
Everyone.

309
00:19:51,029 --> 00:19:52,961
They booked me on
possesion with intent.

310
00:19:55,117 --> 00:19:56,006
I had no job.

311
00:19:56,657 --> 00:19:57,400
Had priors.

312
00:19:58,839 --> 00:19:59,577
Went to jail.

313
00:20:01,378 --> 00:20:03,475
My child was thrown
into foster care.

314
00:20:03,499 --> 00:20:05,852
And they passed him
around from family to family.

315
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,615
And me, nothing.

316
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:09,907
Nothing, huh?

317
00:20:10,391 --> 00:20:12,225
No visits.
No calls.

318
00:20:12,249 --> 00:20:14,781
No letters No contact of any kind.

319
00:20:15,662 --> 00:20:16,735
I got out of jail.

320
00:20:17,743 --> 00:20:18,560
and nothing.

321
00:20:19,295 --> 00:20:20,237
They've got my son.

322
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,600
- You've seen him?
- They won't let me.

323
00:20:27,589 --> 00:20:28,019
Although...

324
00:20:29,657 --> 00:20:30,760
I know where he is.

325
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,120
- Where?
- Canarys.

326
00:20:34,104 --> 00:20:35,656
He's with a family
that has a hotel.

327
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:37,519
He's well.

328
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,887
So, now what?

329
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,270
I'll get my boy.

330
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,920
That's all there is to it.

331
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,160
We'll go far away.

332
00:20:48,736 --> 00:20:50,280
And I'm gonna tell
you something else.

333
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,080
No one in this group

334
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:55,092
is gonna screw
up this job, no one.

335
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:58,712
Because I swear, if anyone does,

336
00:20:58,736 --> 00:21:00,314
I am going to kill them.

337
00:21:06,917 --> 00:21:08,460
Out of everyone's plans,

338
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:10,390
yours...

339
00:21:11,382 --> 00:21:12,200
is the best.

340
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,333
One last question.

341
00:21:22,179 --> 00:21:22,880
Like tequila?

342
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:32,773
Um...

343
00:22:33,835 --> 00:22:34,465
Hello there.

344
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,713
It's 4:03 am. You both know that.

345
00:22:40,037 --> 00:22:41,304
We have class this morning.

346
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,498
Plastic explosives.

347
00:22:45,961 --> 00:22:46,554
Sorry.

348
00:22:47,877 --> 00:22:49,538
Get some rest
before then, alright?

349
00:22:50,542 --> 00:22:51,917
It's past our bedtime?

350
00:22:51,942 --> 00:22:52,577
Go to bed.

351
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:54,729
- All three of us?
- Go to bed!

352
00:22:55,137 --> 00:22:57,240
The jammies look
nice on you, Professor.

353
00:22:57,281 --> 00:22:58,281
Now.

354
00:23:00,764 --> 00:23:01,448
Right now.

355
00:23:07,149 --> 00:23:09,879
You're still... you're still
wearing the stupid lights.

356
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,285
You know, I want that man so much.
He makes me feel so horny.

357
00:23:13,315 --> 00:23:14,929
I can't even stand it!

358
00:23:14,954 --> 00:23:16,444
- Wow, I can't tell.
- You can't?

359
00:23:16,601 --> 00:23:17,333
No...

360
00:23:17,372 --> 00:23:18,400
I bet he can.

361
00:23:43,118 --> 00:23:44,678
Mónica. Hey... Hey, hey hey.

362
00:23:45,104 --> 00:23:45,592
Hey.

363
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,826
You shouldn't be here.

364
00:23:48,914 --> 00:23:49,977
I don't feel well.

365
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:54,150
I think it's just a reaction to the meds.

366
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,920
The meds, huh.

367
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:57,000
Yeah.

368
00:23:57,054 --> 00:23:59,200
That would explain
why you're feeling lousy.

369
00:24:03,338 --> 00:24:05,572
Well, she's really burning up.

370
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,360
- We have to get her out of here now.
- Stop

371
00:24:08,874 --> 00:24:10,590
- Come one. Let's go.
- I'm gonna be sick.

372
00:24:11,937 --> 00:24:13,033
Leave me alone for a minute.

373
00:24:14,265 --> 00:24:14,836
Please.

374
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:29,128
What is it?

375
00:24:33,876 --> 00:24:36,151
She isn't so good.
She's worse.

376
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,141
We've got to extract that bullet

377
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,847
or that woman's gona die.

378
00:24:41,226 --> 00:24:42,310
Take it easy, papa.

379
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:44,299
She'll be alright.

380
00:24:46,724 --> 00:24:48,160
Damn it! Why the
hell did you shoot her?

381
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,261
Berlin would have killed her.

382
00:24:54,287 --> 00:24:55,360
What else could I do?

383
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,600
Son of a bitch.

384
00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:02,934
Let him pull the trigger
next time, not you.

385
00:25:04,766 --> 00:25:05,960
We're here for a robbery.

386
00:25:06,434 --> 00:25:08,621
Not to kill. Or save lives.

387
00:25:09,138 --> 00:25:10,775
Why the hell did we
get ourselves involved

388
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,837
- in this fucking mess?
- Papa, relax. Come on, relax.

389
00:25:13,067 --> 00:25:13,698
Don't worry.

390
00:25:21,223 --> 00:25:23,043
Mónica, are you finished?

391
00:25:24,583 --> 00:25:25,164
Yes.

392
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,377
Let's go.

393
00:25:37,739 --> 00:25:39,200
Raquel, wait a minute.

394
00:25:41,031 --> 00:25:42,052
I want to talk to you.

395
00:25:42,511 --> 00:25:44,498
I'm going to go in
with the medical unit.

396
00:25:45,148 --> 00:25:45,536
No.

397
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,178
I can't let you go.

398
00:25:48,133 --> 00:25:48,968
Yeah right.

399
00:25:49,469 --> 00:25:51,120
I guess there's
always someone better.

400
00:25:59,801 --> 00:26:01,837
Raquel, I'm a firearms expert.

401
00:26:02,402 --> 00:26:05,240
I would be able to go in, assess
how many guns they have,

402
00:26:05,265 --> 00:26:06,552
and whether or not they're fake.

403
00:26:08,831 --> 00:26:10,480
and I can spot the real attackers.

404
00:26:13,749 --> 00:26:14,332
Alright.

405
00:26:15,935 --> 00:26:17,527
You can go in with
the medical unit.

406
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,907
I'll go over it with you.

407
00:26:21,857 --> 00:26:22,844
I heard a shot.

408
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,040
It was the police.
They shot a hostage.

409
00:26:27,601 --> 00:26:28,920
- Really?
- Yes.

410
00:26:30,862 --> 00:26:31,772
Who got shot?

411
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,240
Who was it?

412
00:26:37,269 --> 00:26:38,803
The hostage, who was it?

413
00:26:41,206 --> 00:26:42,542
The factory director.

414
00:26:43,898 --> 00:26:44,680
Arturo?

415
00:26:46,622 --> 00:26:47,951
The police killed Arturo?

416
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,398
No. He wasn't killed.

417
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,746
- You mean it?
- Yes.

418
00:26:52,975 --> 00:26:53,722
Swear to me.

419
00:26:55,001 --> 00:26:57,268
- Arturo's alive?
- I swear to you.

420
00:26:57,594 --> 00:26:58,647
- You're sure?
- I'm sure.

421
00:26:59,612 --> 00:27:01,560
They're sending a surgeon
with his team.

422
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,615
They'll operate and
he'll be fine, okay?

423
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,880
- Operate?
- Yes.

424
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:06,021
Here.

425
00:27:08,737 --> 00:27:09,800
Tell him that I'm alive.

426
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:12,016
You have to tell Arturo.

427
00:27:13,434 --> 00:27:15,741
- You have to.
- No one is telling anyone anything.

428
00:27:15,766 --> 00:27:17,880
Because you'll be fine
and so will he, okay?

429
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,000
Now, let's just take
a look at that wound.

430
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,741
Just relax.

431
00:27:22,416 --> 00:27:24,355
He is going to think
this was all his fault.

432
00:27:25,253 --> 00:27:26,683
He asked me to take the phone.

433
00:27:26,708 --> 00:27:28,562
He'll think I've been
killed because of him.

434
00:27:30,494 --> 00:27:32,968
He need to know
that I'm alive. Please.

435
00:27:34,684 --> 00:27:35,778
And his son, as well.

436
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:41,560
Are you pregnant?

437
00:27:47,706 --> 00:27:48,520
That's great.

438
00:27:50,174 --> 00:27:51,342
Congratulations.

439
00:27:52,694 --> 00:27:54,940
- Have a pen, Denver? Please?
- Of course.

440
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:00,732
When?

441
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:03,842
Thanks.

442
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:06,668
Ángel!

443
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,960
I've decided to send a
group inside to help out.

444
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,168
Ángel will be going in
with the medical unit.

445
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,440
Did you decide that while joyriding
in the ambulance, inspector?

446
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:27,443
At least I'm here to make sure
that no further outbreaks of violence

447
00:28:27,468 --> 00:28:28,935
occur under your watch, okay?

448
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:29,997
Well.

449
00:28:31,007 --> 00:28:33,165
Pacifism is new for the CNI.

450
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,760
You wanted to roll
in tanks, yesterday.

451
00:28:36,102 --> 00:28:38,840
I wanted to surprise them
and finish all of this quickly.

452
00:28:39,307 --> 00:28:41,618
Now my priority is zero casualties.

453
00:28:41,871 --> 00:28:44,602
I advise that you
negotiate and wait.

454
00:28:45,938 --> 00:28:48,120
I guess it must drive you up a wall

455
00:28:48,482 --> 00:28:49,865
to be in charge of us,

456
00:28:49,889 --> 00:28:51,337
but not have an ounce of power.

457
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,514
You're just a pawn
who can't call the shots.

458
00:28:54,891 --> 00:28:55,941
I'm not getting into this,

459
00:28:55,966 --> 00:28:58,292
because I know how hormones
can affect your thinking.

460
00:28:58,751 --> 00:29:00,557
Especially a woman of your age.

461
00:29:01,535 --> 00:29:02,470
Just like my mother.

462
00:29:03,647 --> 00:29:04,480
You're leaving?

463
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,800
I'm sure you know, this
has to be reported, right?

464
00:29:08,231 --> 00:29:08,803
Of course.

465
00:29:13,583 --> 00:29:16,421
Until now, they've been two
steps ahead of us the entire way.

466
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,186
They planned out
everything. Except for this.

467
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,247
The one thing they hadn't planned.

468
00:29:21,745 --> 00:29:23,000
This is our only chance.

469
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:27,726
The one way in without being
detected by their cameras

470
00:29:27,756 --> 00:29:29,864
is through this underground access tunnel.

471
00:29:30,461 --> 00:29:31,649
It leads to the basement.

472
00:29:31,907 --> 00:29:33,837
Which connects to
the ventilation shafts.

473
00:29:34,021 --> 00:29:36,602
And that tunnel was added on
only about seven months ago.

474
00:29:37,045 --> 00:29:38,289
It's still under construction.

475
00:29:38,314 --> 00:29:40,406
They probably don't have
any idea that it's even there.

476
00:29:40,547 --> 00:29:42,237
I need two men to
enter through there.

477
00:29:43,256 --> 00:29:45,467
In that case, Officer Lobo
here, and I will go.

478
00:29:45,997 --> 00:29:46,290
Good.

479
00:29:47,129 --> 00:29:50,530
Assistant Inspector Rubio will go
in as a nurse with the two doctors

480
00:29:51,429 --> 00:29:54,168
It's 18:09 right now.
Set your watches.

481
00:29:54,685 --> 00:29:56,857
At 18:15, the team will move in.

482
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,958
According to the doctors,

483
00:29:57,982 --> 00:30:00,218
the operation shouldn't
take more than 30 minutes.

484
00:30:01,374 --> 00:30:04,194
But you can't go in until
precisely 19:00 hours.

485
00:30:04,956 --> 00:30:07,218
After the surgery, when the
doctors are ready to leave,

486
00:30:07,667 --> 00:30:09,261
the kidnappers will
be on their guard.

487
00:30:09,862 --> 00:30:12,478
That's when Suárez and Lobo
will enter through the tunnel.

488
00:30:13,605 --> 00:30:17,000
You'll both be wearing the same
overalls and masks as the kidnappers.

489
00:30:17,272 --> 00:30:18,485
That way, you'll blend in.

490
00:30:19,553 --> 00:30:22,227
We need precision timing
in order for this to work.

491
00:30:22,633 --> 00:30:23,321
Inspector!

492
00:30:23,768 --> 00:30:25,466
Arturo Román's wife is here.

493
00:30:25,675 --> 00:30:26,645
One moment, please.

494
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,960
Suárez, move out.

495
00:30:30,522 --> 00:30:32,400
Protect the doctors. Good luck.

496
00:30:32,922 --> 00:30:34,160
All units to the front.

497
00:30:35,235 --> 00:30:37,251
Is he alright? Tell me the truth.

498
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,640
Your husband's awake and he's stable.

499
00:30:40,169 --> 00:30:41,449
He's suffered a gunshot wound.

500
00:30:41,508 --> 00:30:45,069
- He was shot? How badly?
- No. He's wounded, but he'll make it.

501
00:30:45,686 --> 00:30:47,320
Relax. Relax.

502
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:50,775
The suspects have allowed
a medical team to go inside

503
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,658
and perform an operation on your husband.

504
00:30:53,838 --> 00:30:54,681
I'm sorry, but...

505
00:30:55,069 --> 00:30:57,040
I didn't hear what you
were saying. I'm too upset.

506
00:30:57,363 --> 00:30:58,240
Yes, I know.

507
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,010
Everything will be okay.

508
00:31:01,016 --> 00:31:02,480
- Have a seat, won't you.
- Thanks.

509
00:31:03,238 --> 00:31:04,521
- I'll let you talk to him right now.
- Okay.

510
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:06,323
Put this on.

511
00:31:06,677 --> 00:31:07,535
- Go on.
- Thank you.

512
00:31:08,298 --> 00:31:09,344
Almansa, start recording.

513
00:31:10,337 --> 00:31:11,832
That bullet needs to come out.

514
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:17,703
Can you do it?

515
00:31:18,786 --> 00:31:19,918
Your hands are steadier.

516
00:31:23,875 --> 00:31:24,334
Well...

517
00:31:24,499 --> 00:31:26,407
What happened to the
medical kit that we brought in?

518
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,480
- It had a scalpel.
- Berlin has it.

519
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,040
Shit.

520
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,271
And I wouldn't
ask him for it either.

521
00:31:33,409 --> 00:31:34,101
The surgeons!

522
00:31:34,488 --> 00:31:35,920
Go and get one
from them. Hurry it up.

523
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,303
- Okay.
- Wait! Wait!

524
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,209
Give this to Arturo, please.

525
00:31:50,782 --> 00:31:52,545
I'm going to clean
your wound up, okay?

526
00:31:53,143 --> 00:31:54,553
You just relax.
It'll be alright.

527
00:31:59,743 --> 00:32:00,105
Yes?

528
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,687
Professor, we have
Arturo Román's wife here.

529
00:32:03,528 --> 00:32:03,992
Okay.

530
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,146
Arturo.

531
00:32:16,545 --> 00:32:17,156
Arturo!

532
00:32:20,186 --> 00:32:21,537
Your wife's name is...

533
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,280
Laura.

534
00:32:25,627 --> 00:32:27,280
Pretty name.
You may talk to her now.

535
00:32:28,915 --> 00:32:30,600
Wives are meant
for these moments.

536
00:32:32,365 --> 00:32:33,146
They comfort us.

537
00:32:33,935 --> 00:32:36,545
Yet a husband will ignore
the fact that he's married

538
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:39,334
and doesn't think about his
wife when he's out carousing.

539
00:32:39,413 --> 00:32:39,750
But...

540
00:32:40,873 --> 00:32:42,308
When there's a problem,

541
00:32:42,635 --> 00:32:43,787
or an accident...

542
00:32:44,158 --> 00:32:45,818
or he's afraid of something...

543
00:32:46,522 --> 00:32:47,341
things change.

544
00:32:52,192 --> 00:32:54,512
Or are you thinking
of your secretary?

545
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:57,672
You are.

546
00:32:59,335 --> 00:32:59,833
No.

547
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,028
Who has time to
think about lovers or...

548
00:33:03,854 --> 00:33:05,804
those pesky abortions...

549
00:33:06,521 --> 00:33:08,627
- or anything?
- Spare me your speech, you...

550
00:33:08,656 --> 00:33:09,604
Listen up.

551
00:33:10,591 --> 00:33:12,676
If you say anything
stupid, I'll shoot you

552
00:33:12,701 --> 00:33:14,683
so that your wife
will listen as you die.

553
00:33:14,853 --> 00:33:15,566
Got it?

554
00:33:26,425 --> 00:33:27,023
Inspector!

555
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,772
They're calling the cellphone.

556
00:33:30,071 --> 00:33:31,412
We have to hack the cellphone.

557
00:33:31,757 --> 00:33:33,717
I want to see through the
front and back cameras.

558
00:33:35,745 --> 00:33:37,163
Here you go. talk.

559
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,267
Hello, sweetheart.

560
00:33:40,001 --> 00:33:41,800
Arturo, how are you, my love?

561
00:33:42,004 --> 00:33:43,596
Fine, fine. I'm okay.

562
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,172
- I was shot in the shoulder so the bullet...
- No image.

563
00:33:46,201 --> 00:33:48,485
There's nothing on either camera.
They're black.

564
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,960
I hear they're bringing in
some doctors to operate on me.

565
00:33:53,125 --> 00:33:53,639
I know.

566
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:55,800
I've been worried...

567
00:33:57,054 --> 00:33:58,715
about us for a long while now.

568
00:33:59,855 --> 00:34:01,200
And everything we did wrong.

569
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,240
Don't think about that,
sweetheart. Not now.

570
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:04,632
Not now.

571
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,640
Besides, it's my own fault.

572
00:34:08,721 --> 00:34:11,800
I know we're not okay.
And we haven't been for some time.

573
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:13,866
I've been distant
from you and the kids.

574
00:34:14,579 --> 00:34:15,741
I've been very selfish.

575
00:34:16,744 --> 00:34:18,963
But I promise things are
going to be better, okay?

576
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,440
I promise you, they'll change.

577
00:34:22,647 --> 00:34:24,040
You've been saying
for 10 years how much

578
00:34:24,064 --> 00:34:25,598
you want to see your
sister in Australia.

579
00:34:27,452 --> 00:34:28,515
Once this is all over,

580
00:34:28,539 --> 00:34:30,652
maybe the kids can
finally get to go there and

581
00:34:30,722 --> 00:34:31,967
see some kangaroos.

582
00:34:33,644 --> 00:34:35,720
That's the first thing
we'll do when I get home.

583
00:34:36,704 --> 00:34:37,597
You deserve more.

584
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:40,543
But I promise I love you.

585
00:34:41,194 --> 00:34:42,520
And I'd do anything for you.

586
00:34:43,959 --> 00:34:45,740
All of these years I wasted,

587
00:34:47,514 --> 00:34:50,447
chasing stupid things
like money and status.

588
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,564
I realize now, those
things were never important.

589
00:34:54,391 --> 00:34:55,480
It's always been you.

590
00:34:57,537 --> 00:34:58,911
Since the first day I met you.

591
00:35:01,893 --> 00:35:03,320
There are some times when...

592
00:35:04,085 --> 00:35:05,988
I sit there thinking
about that day...

593
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,200
And I'm still wondering what
the hell you saw in me, Mónica.

594
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,083
Laura.

595
00:35:23,105 --> 00:35:24,589
Just think about
getting out of there.

596
00:35:28,266 --> 00:35:29,265
Just think about that.

597
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,051
I love you.

598
00:35:32,548 --> 00:35:33,668
I love you, my dear.

599
00:35:40,981 --> 00:35:41,981
Are you alright?

600
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:43,787
It's okay.

601
00:35:44,263 --> 00:35:44,990
Relax.

602
00:35:46,104 --> 00:35:48,040
You're a piece of work, Arturo.

603
00:35:49,226 --> 00:35:50,760
Your secretary is pregnant

604
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:52,640
with your baby.

605
00:35:53,768 --> 00:35:57,213
The wifey is waiting for
you in the SUV with the kids.

606
00:35:57,725 --> 00:36:01,164
And you, wallowing cash,
you're a living legend.

607
00:36:02,865 --> 00:36:03,519
Berlin!

608
00:36:04,344 --> 00:36:05,469
The doctors are outside!

609
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:09,645
If you'll excuse me.

610
00:36:15,827 --> 00:36:17,225
Everyone knows their jobs?

611
00:36:17,405 --> 00:36:19,574
Of course. They
all know their parts.

612
00:36:19,687 --> 00:36:20,547
Are you ready?

613
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:21,471
Yes.

614
00:36:22,365 --> 00:36:22,982
They're ready.

615
00:36:23,793 --> 00:36:24,863
Mercedes.

616
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,223
Are you ready?

617
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,591
- Yes, sir.
- I want her out of here.

618
00:36:30,877 --> 00:36:33,157
Rio, take her to the office.

619
00:36:36,342 --> 00:36:37,171
Nairobi.

620
00:36:38,495 --> 00:36:41,389
Everybody, put your masks on!

621
00:36:43,103 --> 00:36:45,253
And follow me! Rock and roll!

622
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,400
Walk forward.

623
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:11,993
Leave everything on the floor.

624
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,217
Close the doors.

625
00:37:25,367 --> 00:37:26,056
Follow us.

626
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,357
Hands on your heads
and spread your legs.

627
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,199
We're gonna pat you down.

628
00:37:47,663 --> 00:37:49,492
Please escort the gentleman out.

629
00:38:06,476 --> 00:38:07,352
Listen to me.

630
00:38:08,456 --> 00:38:10,355
One of those doctors
is with the police.

631
00:38:10,659 --> 00:38:12,680
- Which one?
- The one with glasses.

632
00:38:13,216 --> 00:38:14,091
You know what to do.

633
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,640
- Absolutely. We're on it.
- Berlin!

634
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,099
This has to be
handled flawlessly.

635
00:38:20,955 --> 00:38:21,509
I know.

636
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:25,052
Apparently

637
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:27,247
The man wearing
glasses is an officer.

638
00:38:29,533 --> 00:38:30,533
They'll get in.

639
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:33,016
I don't know if it
wil be a breach,

640
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,866
or forced entry, or...

641
00:38:35,327 --> 00:38:37,781
a Red Cross volunteer,
or a pizza guy.

642
00:38:38,679 --> 00:38:41,265
but they are going
to infiltrate somehow.

643
00:38:42,726 --> 00:38:46,795
And that will be our opportunity
to employ a Trojan horse.

644
00:38:47,531 --> 00:38:48,077
What's that?

645
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,759
- I don't know, but it rhymes with...
- No!

646
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:54,578
- The Trojan horse is...
- Rhymes with hoarse!

647
00:38:54,897 --> 00:38:56,761
Shut up and pay
attention, smart-ass.

648
00:38:57,621 --> 00:38:58,112
Sorry.

649
00:39:00,903 --> 00:39:01,760
I'm sorry.

650
00:39:04,532 --> 00:39:06,526
The Greeks were at
war with the Trojans.

651
00:39:08,154 --> 00:39:11,115
One day, the Trojans
saw a wooden horse

652
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,709
a giant wooden horse.

653
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:13,752
at their gates.

654
00:39:15,222 --> 00:39:17,786
Their vanity led them to think
the Greeks had surrendered

655
00:39:17,811 --> 00:39:19,145
and that this was a gift.

656
00:39:19,415 --> 00:39:21,555
So the Trojans
opened the city gates...

657
00:39:22,292 --> 00:39:23,489
and pulled it inside.

658
00:39:24,352 --> 00:39:26,320
They didn't know that
the horse was hollow

659
00:39:27,635 --> 00:39:29,739
and filled with Greek soldiers.

660
00:39:32,569 --> 00:39:34,521
The Trojans were
easily defeated.

661
00:39:38,953 --> 00:39:41,047
And that's the strategy
we're going to use.

662
00:39:46,995 --> 00:39:48,435
When they're inside

663
00:39:50,195 --> 00:39:51,907
and believe that they're
winning the battle...

664
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,107
Place all metal
objects in this bin.

665
00:40:12,747 --> 00:40:15,079
That goes for watches and glasses.

666
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,731
If you have weapons, or
anything that emits a signal

667
00:40:18,848 --> 00:40:20,933
I urge you to place them here.

668
00:40:21,136 --> 00:40:22,960
We're tracing every signal.

669
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:26,069
Remove your shoes too, please.

670
00:40:29,976 --> 00:40:31,812
Now lie face down on the floor.

671
00:40:36,916 --> 00:40:37,765
That's it.

672
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,313
Like roaches.

673
00:41:09,688 --> 00:41:10,688
On your feet.

674
00:41:13,602 --> 00:41:14,621
Put your shoes on.

675
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,612
Take the glasses only.

676
00:41:21,788 --> 00:41:22,598
You'll need those.

677
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:26,556
Okay... welcome.

678
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:28,862
Grab your things
and come with me.

679
00:41:29,107 --> 00:41:30,225
Thank you.
