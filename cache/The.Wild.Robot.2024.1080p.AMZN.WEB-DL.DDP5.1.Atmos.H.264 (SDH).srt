00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:28,745
Do you believe
everything you hear?

340
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:29,913
Yes.

341
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,499
(chuckles) Noted.

342
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,293
Why did you steal my gosling?

343
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,545
I'm a fox. I do foxy things.

344
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:38,088
It's in my nature.

345
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,090
Your programming.

346
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,550
Why'd you help me?

347
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,969
I'm a robot.
I do robot-y things.

348
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:47,264
I seek tasks
and ensure all essential needs

349
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,932
have been met or exceeded.

350
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,726
(Fink sniffing)

351
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,521
(gasps, giggles)

352
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,398
(babbling hysterically)

353
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,066
I have some essential needs.

354
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,109
FINK and GOSLING:
Aw.

355
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,361
Fink, as a local goose expert,

356
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:04,656
how do I get-- mmm--
to eat, swim, fly?

357
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:07,951
(laughs)
I thought you'd never ask.

358
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,245
Let's start with eat.

359
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,497
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right there.

360
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,626
Hmm.

361
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:19,254
(yelping, grunting)

362
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,756
Ow.

363
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,049
ROZZUM 7134: I do not think
these are suitable.

364
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,258
FINK:
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

365
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,135
Let me check.

366
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,970
Mmm. Seems good to me.

367
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:30,557
Say, can you make yourself
look like a bear?

368
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,851
(Fink clears throat)

369
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,603
FINK (imitating bear):
I'm here for a honey lunch.

370
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:35,979
-(bees buzzing)
-(gosling laughing)

371
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,606
ROZZUM 7134:
I believe I am under attack.

372
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,483
-You're doing great.
-Should I be concerned?

373
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,360
Sorry, can't hear you.

374
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,403
(chuckling)

375
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:46,323
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.
Here you go, kid.

376
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,283
-(whistling through air)
-(grunts)

377
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,494
(growling)

378
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,538
Huh?

379
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:59,086
ROZZUM 7134: How do goslings
normally do this?

380
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,798
FINK:
(gasps) Ooh.

381
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,050
Mmm, mmm.

382
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,052
ROZZUM 7134:
This is not working.

383
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,261
Are you kidding?

384
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,305
Everything is working great.

385
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:11,681
(stomach growling)

386
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,225
-Oh, yeah, that.
-(gosling whimpers)

387
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:14,476
Here.

388
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,520
(chuckles, gasps) Yum.

389
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,147
ROZZUM 7134:
Phase one of task is completed.

390
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,691
Now, we're gonna have to do
all this over tomorrow.

391
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,152
All these kids do... (slurps)

392
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,946
is eat. (burps)

393
00:23:25,987 --> 00:23:27,697
ROZZUM 7134:
I understand.

394
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,991
-FINK: What's that?
-ROZZUM 7134: My power core.

395
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,410
It is damaged.

396
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:34,621
Without it, I rely on my
solar surfaces and batteries.

397
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,915
Yeah, you should work on that.

398
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,250
Mmm. (burps)

399
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:41,128
ROZZUM 7134: I also need
a replacement transmitter.

400
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:43,213
Ugh, do I have to do everything?

401
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:46,133
When we run across
another robot, we'll kill it

402
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,176
-and take its transmitter.
-Negative.

403
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,637
-(grunts) Huh?
-Rozzum inhibition protocols

404
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,514
prevent deliberate harm
to others.

405
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:56,852
Look, you need to learn
how things work on this island.

406
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:59,729
-(crab screams)
-Me, the bear, everybody,

407
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:01,857
we're all just trying
to survive.

408
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:05,735
And kindness is not
a survival skill.

409
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:06,820
Mmm.

410
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,071
-(gosling laughing)
-Yeah, so, uh,

411
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,739
how did you get
a gosling anyway?

412
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:11,241
ROZZUM 7134:
There was an accident.

413
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,742
I terminated his family.

414
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,202
(hushed):
For future reference,

415
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,079
you probably want to keep
all that to yourself.

416
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:19,374
ROZZUM 7134: Understood.
Do not mention dead family.

417
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:23,628
Fink, how long do you estimate
swim and fly to take?

418
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,046
Swimming's easy.

419
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,507
I can teach him
the way my mom taught me.

420
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,593
-Swim!
-(gosling screams)

421
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,970
-ROZZUM 7134: Fink.
-Hmm?

422
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,763
-He will not learn that way.
-(gosling gasping, coughing)

423
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,099
(groans)
Not if you keep doing that.

424
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:38,393
(grunting)

425
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,936
Just between us,
this whole thing

426
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,813
might not take as long
as you think.

427
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:44,149
Your gosling,
he isn't exactly...

428
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,609
-(yelps)
-...normal.

429
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,777
ROZZUM 7134:
I have a defective baby?

430
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,779
FINK:
He's what they call a runt.

431
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,198
-ROZZUM 7134: A runt.
-(yells, grunts)

432
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,116
FINK: Fact is,
even if his whole family

433
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,326
hadn't have been killed,

434
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:56,411
he probably wouldn't
have lived very long.

435
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:57,913
-Just, I don't know...
-Whoa!

436
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,664
...don't get too attached
to the little guy.

437
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,124
That's all.

438
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,793
If you want,
I could eat him right now

439
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,879
-and save you the grief later.
-Negative.

440
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:09,633
Eating this task is not
the same as completing it.

441
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:12,427
Ugh. So we're doing this.

442
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:15,889
Well, if you don't want me
or anyone else to eat him,

443
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:19,392
you're gonna need a place
that's safer than out here!

444
00:25:19,434 --> 00:25:22,145
Which is a great idea!

445
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,481
New project. (yelps)

446
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:25,649
(burps)

447
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,317
Is it normal to burp this much?

448
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,653
Ooh. (burps, chomps)

449
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,655
(chirping)

450
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,949
(animals chattering)

451
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,787
BABY OPOSSUM:
That thing's gonna fall on you.

452
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,497
BABY OPOSSUM 2:
And squish you to jelly.

453
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,915
SQUIRREL:
This guy's nuts.

454
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,625
-ROZZUM 7134: Who is that?
-FINK: Paddler?

455
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,043
Local laughingstock.

456
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,462
Spends every day
trying to cut down

457
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,506
the biggest tree on the island.

458
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,174
(laughing):
He's obsessed.

459
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,760
Kind of like you
and your task hang-up.

460
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,762
ROZZUM 7134:
His programming.

461
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:58,390
Hey, Paddler, you're never
gonna finish that!

462
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:00,517
Felling this is not the point.

463
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,061
The process is the art.

464
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,813
And that's what happens
to your brain

465
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:07,440
when you eat wood, weirdo.

466
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,858
-(laughter)
-Yeah?

467
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,860
Well, you'll eat
those words, vermin.

468
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,362
ROZZUM 7134:
Are you sure

469
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,864
Paddler will not mind us
borrowing his home?

470
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,033
He doesn't need to know.

471
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:21,538
Mmm.

472
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,457
Hmm? Huh?

473
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:25,959
Seriously?

474
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:29,129
He needs room for me
and my stuff.

475
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,880
Better.

476
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,049
Now, you can make one
this big, right?

477
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:37,762
ROZZUM 7134: No task is
impossible for Rozzum 7134.

478
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:39,472
Roz... (mumbles)

479
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,808
7... 34?

480
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:45,228
-(panting)
-But you can call me Roz.

481
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,813
Roz! (giggles)

482
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,398
Roz, Roz, Roz, Roz...

483
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,568
Where are you from that things
don't eat each other?

484
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,069
ROZ:
I do not know my origin point.

485
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,779
-(mouse squeaking)
-Well, who made you?

486
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,906
ROZ:
Someone made me?

487
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,950
-Someone made me?
-(animals laughing)

488
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,660
-(Fink grunts)
-(squirrel yells)

489
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,871
(Fink and gosling laughing)

490
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:04,998
ROZ:
Humor is based on misfortune?

491
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,083
-Misfortune.
-Yeah.

492
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:08,084
Here.

493
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,586
-Try it.
-GOSLING: Yeah.

494
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,171
-(Fink grunts)
-(animals laughing)

495
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:13,381
-FINK: Not funny.
-GOSLING: Not funny.

496
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,927
-Ugh. Squirrels.

00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,434
ROZ:
Your inefficient participation

498
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,894
will slow the process.

499
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,812
Slow the process.

500
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:29,689
I'll just be over here.

501
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,776
Little sad but otherwise okay.

502
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,402
ROZ:
Just this once.

503
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:36,655
♪ ♪

(tapping)

505
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,547
Perfect.

506
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:55,924
Home?

507
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:57,801
Meh. A little rustic.

508
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,762
ROZ:
I think I know what is missing.

509
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,308
(thunder rumbling)

510
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,018
FINK: So, what are you
gonna name him?

511
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:11,189
-I assign to you Gosling 0001.
-Huh?

512
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,400
-Okay, that sucked.
-GOSLING: That sucked.

513
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:16,361
(thunder crashes, rumbles)

514
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,737
GOSLING:
Whoa.

515
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:20,156
FINK: You got to learn
to make stuff up.

516
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:24,911
Come on. Find that...
(howls) inside you.

517
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,329
ROZ:
Searching.

518
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,831
(howling robotically)

519
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,874
(gosling imitating Roz's howl)

520
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,751
-Anything yet?
-ROZ: No.

521
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:35,004
Just have a little fun for once.

522
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:39,342
Gosling 0186. There.

523
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,885
You see what I did?

524
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:43,346
His numbering is
out of sequence.

525
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,848
(laughs robotically)

526
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,891
(animals laughing)

527
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,144
(laughter stops)

528
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:51,354
His name can't have numbers.

529
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,523
It's like someone
didn't even like him.

530
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,608
ROZ:
My name has numbers.

531
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,235
FINK:
It's got to be personal.

532
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,403
Personal.

533
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,447
Processing "personal."

534
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:03,700
Bright. Bill.

535
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,118
Brightbill.

536
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,745
Is that satisfactory?

537
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:08,955
Brightbill? Processing.

538
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,707
Beep, beep, boop, boop.

539
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:13,543
-Satisfactory.
-FINK: Oh, yeah.

540
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,920
That's perfect. Oh.

541
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:18,506
(chuckling):
Oh. Oh.

542
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:19,716
That's nice.

543
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:20,967
(sighs)

544
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:22,802
-PADDLER: Comfortable, are we?
-(gasps)

545
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,846
This house of yours?

546
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,015
You copied it. It's my design.

547
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:30,560
I know it was you,
and I know where you live.

548
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,228
-(thunder crashes)
-(Brightbill gasps)

549
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,563
(whimpering)

550
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,566
Oh, perfect. Now no one's
gonna get any sleep.

551
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,027
How do we reset Brightbill?

552
00:29:39,068 --> 00:29:42,238
When I was little,
my mom would rock me to sleep.

553
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,615
-Like this!
-(whimpering)

554
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,074
ROZ:
That will damage him.

555
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,452
Hey. I turned out just fine.

556
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,746
(groans)
You could tell him a story,

557
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,998
but that's a lot more work.

558
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,751
How will fictional narrative
help Brightbill?

559
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:58,922
Kids need to feel safe
and loved and all that junk.

560
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,757
A story can do that?

561
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:04,761
Storytelling is lying-adjacent,
and I lie for a living.

562
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:07,096
-Watch and learn.
-(Brightbill whimpering)

563
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,182
Just fill in the blanks.

564
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:14,020
Let me see here. Once,
there was, uh, this island

565
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,980
with a little gosling.

566
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,148
Brightbill?

567
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,609
And he was all alone.

568
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,278
ROZ: Because the rest
of his family was destroyed.

569
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,655
Not yet.

570
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:25,114
(sighs)

571
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,200
And what this
little gosling needed

572
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,618
-was a mother.
-Ooh.

573
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,829
-(laughing)
-So he looked up at the stars

574
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,122
and asked the brightest one

575
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,333
if it could send him
one of their extras.

576
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:38,795
Funny thing is
there's this beautiful robot

577
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:42,215
that happened to be sitting
on the edge of that star.

578
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,842
And she hears him.

579
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,802
-Okay, now.
-ROZ: Which is impossible

580
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:49,013
since sound does not travel
through the vacuum of space.

581
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:51,975
Ugh. But she still heard him

582
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:55,395
because she was listening with
a different part of herself.

583
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:59,566
A part that, up to that point,
she didn't even know she had.

584
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:00,942
Her heart.

585
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,903
How did my mama come to me
from so far away?

586
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,905
-Who cares?
-Huh?

587
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:08,825
Uh, I mean,
she's trying to see you.

588
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,577
-Me?
-And falls off that star

589
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:14,414
and lands on the beach
just a little ways from here.

590
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:17,959
But she lands pretty hard,
and a lot of stuff she knew

591
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:20,253
-just kind of fell out.
-Oh, no!

592
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,546
FINK:
So it's a little weird

593
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,172
what she knows
and what she doesn't.

594
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:26,301
But she remembers
one thing: you.

595
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:29,637
-(gasps)
-And when she finally sees you,

596
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,181
-she feels...
-ROZ: Crushing obligation.

597
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:34,642
Very lucky to be a mother.

598
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:35,810
BRIGHTBILL:
Mama.

599
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,020
ROZ:
And I will not leave

600
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,479
until I have completed
this task,

601
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:40,690
which has delayed me,
damaged me

602
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,233
and violated my protocols,

603
00:31:42,275 --> 00:31:44,694
potentially voiding my warranty.

604
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,071
Which is robot for:

605
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:49,782
She loves you very much.

606
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:52,869
(Brightbill yawns, sighs)

607
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:54,787
ROZ:
The story worked.

608
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:57,582
(gags) I need a drink.

609
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,585
(groans)

610
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:03,212
ROZ:
How do you tell a story

611
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,924
about something
you say you know nothing about?

612
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:08,009
You'll need to be more specific.

613
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,761
Love.

614
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,639
Yeah, well, when you grow up
without something,

615
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,100
you spend a lot of time
thinking about it.

616
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:18,937
(chiming,
soft electrical buzzing)

617
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:24,233
ROZ: To conserve battery power,
I must shut down until morning.

618
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:30,239
(Brightbill takes deep breath)

619
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:36,955
(grunts, sighs)

620
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:46,089
BRIGHTBILL: I miss her
when she sleeps, too.

621
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:59,102
(imitating robotic whirring
and clanking)

622
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,107
Scanning.
Beep, bop, boop, boop.

623
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,401
Possible animal friend sighted.
(imitates robotic whooshing)

624
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:09,278
Activating interspecies
outreach protocol.

625
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,280
(imitates robotic whirring)

626
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,533
Hello. Bonjour. Hujambo.

627
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,785
I am Gosling 0186,

628
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,162
-but you can call me Bright...
-(screams)

629
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,956
(sighs) I expected to have

630
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,291
at least one friend by summer,
but they all just...

631
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,168
-Scream and run?
-Yes.

632
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,838
I have experienced
the same phenomenon.

633
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,172
-Fink?
-Beats me.

634
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:30,717
Nothing weird about you two.

635
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,635
ROZ:
Thank you.

636
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,847
Show me deer.

637
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,348
BRIGHTBILL:
Uh, bear.

638
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:39,308
Porcupine. Squirrel.

639
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,269
Uh, turtle opossum.
Otter moose.

640
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,645
FINK:
Now skunk.

641
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,814
ROZ:
I do not want to do skunk.

642
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,649
(whining):
Skunk.

643
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,569
-(Roz groans)
-Skunky, skunky, skunky.

644
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,946
-Boo! (laughs)
-(Brightbill coughing)

645
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,573
How do you do that?

646
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:56,159
I overheat
my Fallium transducer coils,

647
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,619
then leak a little
hydraulic fluid on them.

648
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:00,496
BRIGHTBILL: Does overheating
the transducers

649
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:02,123
have any draining effect on
the secondary cooling modules?

650
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,333
ROZ: Not if I precool
the load sensors.

651
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,960
(Brightbill sighs)

652
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:07,754
BRIGHTBILL and ROZ: Exemplary
day for swimming tests.

653
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:10,465
-Pinktail, appetizers.
-(baby opossums gasp)

654
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:12,842
They were bored
and wanted to see stuff sink.

655
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,218
Death's proximity...

656
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,179
Makes life burn
all the brighter.

657
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,889
-It's true.

982
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:27,274
So, you think small wings
to be a disappointment?

983
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:30,736
Small wings are teeth,
the claws of the sky.

984
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:32,654
Tho-Those are, uh,
d-different things.

985
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,531

So, he's safe, right?

991
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:48,545
FINK:
Hmm? Maybe.

992
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:50,881
-Follow me.
-(both grunt)

993
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:54,217
Your shape takes more work
to fly straight

994
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:58,096
but easier to turn and dive.

Longneck, one of the leaders
of the coming migration.

1011
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:47,854
I've been watching you both
for some time.

1012
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,439
You are the only goose

1013

that has ever bothered
to be civil with us.

We geese are a cranky lot,

1015
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:56,947
suspicious of
pretty much everything,

1016
00:51:56,988 --> 00:52:00,242
but at least
we're good conversationalists.

1017
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:02,244
-Really?
-No.

1018

We're all so boring.

1019
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,497
All we do is gossip.

1020
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:07,499
I dare say Brightbill is
the most interesting among us,

1021
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:10,919
though none would ever admit it.

1022
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,213
When do you leave?

1023
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,299
A week.

1024
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:18,844

1026
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:22,514
Keep him in the air all day.

1027
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:25,934
First light to dusk, his feet
cannot touch the ground.

1028
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,102
Understand?

1029
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:28,603
I understand.

1030
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:32,357
Brightbill was never
supposed to get this far.

1031
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:34,693
You know that.

1032
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:37,821
It is more dangerous for him
than anyone else.

1033
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:42,576
But he has a chance if,
where his wings end,

1034
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:46,121
his heart can pay the balance.

1035
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,832
His heart is 48 millimeters.

1036
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,126
From what I've seen,
Brightbill's heart

1037
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:53,753
is much bigger on the inside

1038
