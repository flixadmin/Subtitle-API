00:01:27,771 --> 00:01:29,440
Hey. Hey.

3
00:01:32,151 --> 00:01:33,527
Hey. Hey.

4
00:01:35,696 --> 00:01:37,364
Hey. Hey.

5
00:01:57,009 --> 00:01:58,177
Hmm?

6
00:02:00,346 --> 00:02:04,642
That's right. It is I, Tai Lung.

7
00:02:04,642 --> 00:02:05,935
It can't be.

8
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:08,103
Tai Lung.

9
00:02:08,103 --> 00:02:10,856
I have returned to take what is mine.

10
00:02:10,856 --> 00:02:14,151
Which is everything that is yours.

11
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:27,623
Let it be known from the highest mountain
to the lowest valley that Tai Lung lives,

12
00:02:27,623 --> 00:02:30,793
and no one will stand in his way.

13
00:02:30,793 --> 00:02:34,797
Not even the great Dragon Warrior.

14
00:02:43,847 --> 00:02:45,766
Oh, where is Po?

15
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:48,519
He was supposed to be here hours ago.

16
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:51,522
Ping, will you please just relax?

17
00:02:51,522 --> 00:02:53,482
I am relaxed!

18
00:02:53,482 --> 00:02:56,193
Okay. I'm sure Po is fine.

19
00:02:56,193 --> 00:02:58,779
But what if he's sick? What if he's hurt?

20
00:02:58,779 --> 00:03:00,406
- What if he's hungry?

21
00:03:00,406 --> 00:03:02,157
Don't get your noodles in a twist.

22
00:03:02,157 --> 00:03:06,704
If I know our son, he's probably just
kicking back and catching some rays.

23
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:14,211
Kung fu!

24
00:03:15,296 --> 00:03:17,506
Whoa! That's bad.

25
00:03:18,257 --> 00:03:20,384
Whoa! Getting worse.

26
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:22,803
Whoa!

27
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:25,639
Ah, come on!

28
00:03:42,448 --> 00:03:44,825
Ha-ha!

29
00:03:49,413 --> 00:03:52,541
Okay, big guy.
We're really gonna have to wrap this up.

30
00:04:05,596 --> 00:04:06,639
Whee!

31
00:04:07,556 --> 00:04:09,141
- Oink.
- Oink.

32
00:04:09,141 --> 00:04:10,226
- Again, again!

33
00:04:10,226 --> 00:04:12,144
- That was fun.
- Let's do that again.

34
00:04:12,144 --> 00:04:16,981
And next time,
keep your surf off their turf.

35
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:24,990
I'm late. I'm late. Ooh, I'm late.

36
00:04:26,075 --> 00:04:28,410
- The Dragon Warrior is back!
- It's the Dragon Warrior!

37
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:31,038
Was, is and always will be.

38
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:32,915
We love you, Dragon Warrior!

39
00:04:32,915 --> 00:04:34,542
And I love you too, adoring fan.

40
00:04:34,542 --> 00:04:36,126
Sign my scroll. Sign my hat.

41
00:04:36,126 --> 00:04:37,294
- Sign my shirt. Okay, okay.

42
00:04:37,294 --> 00:04:38,712
I'll sign whatever you want.

43
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:40,589
Po!

44
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,716
Master Shifu!

45
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:44,343
Here, let me just...

46
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:47,805
There, that's much... worse.

47
00:04:49,098 --> 00:04:50,140
We have to talk.

48
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:53,018
Absolutely. Let's talk.
Right after the ceremony.

49
00:04:53,018 --> 00:04:55,104
- Let's go!
- Ceremony?

50
00:04:55,104 --> 00:04:56,397
What ceremony?

51
00:04:57,022 --> 00:04:58,858
The Staff of Wisdom. Ooh.

52
00:04:58,858 --> 00:05:01,652
- Given to me by Master Oogway himself.
- Aah.

53
00:05:01,652 --> 00:05:03,821
It is said that
whoever possesses this staff

54
00:05:03,821 --> 00:05:06,782
has the power
to travel between the realms.

55
00:05:06,782 --> 00:05:09,702
The power to unlock the door
to the Spirit Realm.

56
00:05:09,702 --> 00:05:12,121
And now, the power to open...

57
00:05:12,121 --> 00:05:16,917
the all-new
Dragon Warrior Noodles and Tofu.

58
00:05:18,669 --> 00:05:23,048
Where the broth has kick
and the bean curd's a knockout.

59
00:05:27,219 --> 00:05:28,554
Dragon Warrior!

60
00:05:28,554 --> 00:05:30,681
Will the Furious Five be here too?

61
00:05:30,681 --> 00:05:32,057
Unfortunately, no.

62
00:05:32,057 --> 00:05:34,727
They're off on
super cool kung fu missions.

63
00:05:34,727 --> 00:05:37,188
Tigress is taking on
the free-range chicken gang.

64
00:05:37,188 --> 00:05:39,398
<i>Monkey's hot on the trail
of the missing macaque.</i>

65
00:05:39,398 --> 00:05:41,233
<i>Crane was crowned
king of the Crocodilians.</i>

66
00:05:41,233 --> 00:05:42,610
Crane! <i>Long story.</i>

67
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,487
<i>Viper's wrapping up peace talks
between the cobras and the mongooses.</i>

68
00:05:45,487 --> 00:05:46,447
<i>Or is it mongeese?</i>

69
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:47,740
<i>And Mantis?</i>

70
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,784
<i>Well, he's just trying to keep his
blushing bride from biting his head off.</i>

71
00:05:52,995 --> 00:05:54,413
Just 'cause they're not here in person

72
00:05:54,413 --> 00:05:57,082
doesn't mean they're not here
as life-sized cut-outs.

73
00:05:57,082 --> 00:06:00,169
Now, who wants a picture?
Okay, okay. One at a time.

74
00:06:00,169 --> 00:06:01,962
- Oh! Me, me, me! Me!
- You.

75
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,632
My turn! My turn!

76
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:05,716
And then you.

77
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:13,557
He really captured
your disapproving scowl.

78
00:06:13,557 --> 00:06:14,767
We need to talk.

79
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:17,436
- Now.

80
00:06:17,436 --> 00:06:19,522
Hey, can I get one of those
in a wallet size?

81
00:06:19,522 --> 00:06:20,856
- Po!
- Coming.

82
00:06:22,942 --> 00:06:26,320
Do you remember the first time you climbed
these steps to the Jade Palace?

83
00:06:27,196 --> 00:06:30,115
How could I forget?
I thought I'd never make it to the top.

84
00:06:30,115 --> 00:06:31,617
Yes, but you persevered.

85
00:06:31,617 --> 00:06:35,871
And once again, destiny calls for you
to take the next step on your journey.

86
00:06:35,871 --> 00:06:37,790
The next step?
What are you talking about?

87
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:40,167
I've already taken all the steps.
Haven't I?

88
00:06:40,167 --> 00:06:42,962
It is time for you
to choose your successor.

89
00:06:42,962 --> 00:06:44,380
Successor for what?

90
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,800
A successor to be
the next Dragon Warrior.

91
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,760
Oh... [chuckles] Yeah, I get it.

92
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,179
Funny, 'cause I'm the Dragon Warrior.

93
00:06:55,558 --> 00:06:56,892
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait, wait.

94
00:06:56,892 --> 00:06:59,645
You mean, I'm not gonna be
the Dragon Warrior anymore?

95
00:06:59,645 --> 00:07:01,605
- Exactly.
- Then what am I gonna be?

96
00:07:01,605 --> 00:07:03,274
Once a successor is chosen,

97
00:07:03,274 --> 00:07:06,402
you will advance
to the highest level in all of kung fu.

98
00:07:06,402 --> 00:07:09,488
Spiritual Leader
of the Valley of Peace.

99
00:07:10,406 --> 00:07:11,866
Whoa.

100
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,326
I don't know what that means.

101
00:07:14,326 --> 00:07:16,745
It's just like
Master Oogway before you.

102
00:07:16,745 --> 00:07:21,375
You will oversee the Valley,
passing along wisdom and inspiring hope.

103
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,627
Look, I appreciate the promotion.

104
00:07:23,627 --> 00:07:27,256
I think I'm just gonna stick with
the whole "Dragon Warrior" thing.

105
00:07:27,256 --> 00:07:30,175
Dragon Warrior "thing"?
What is it you're holding?

106
00:07:30,175 --> 00:07:31,343
A cookie.

107
00:07:31,343 --> 00:07:32,636
Other hand.

108
00:07:32,636 --> 00:07:34,346
The Staff of Wisdom.

109
00:07:34,346 --> 00:07:36,348
It was given to you
by Master Oogway.

110
00:07:36,348 --> 00:07:38,684
Do you really think it was so you could
open a restaurant?

111
00:07:38,684 --> 00:07:39,935
Or pose for pictures?

112
00:07:39,935 --> 00:07:41,687
He wasn't super specific.

113
00:07:41,687 --> 00:07:45,983
Oogway entrusted you with that staff
so you could follow in his footsteps

114
00:07:45,983 --> 00:07:48,944
and become something better
than you already are.

115
00:07:48,944 --> 00:07:50,196
You take it.

116
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:52,823
No. Oogway did not give it to me.

117
00:07:52,823 --> 00:07:56,285
Being the next Oogway is not my destiny,
which I have accepted

118
00:07:56,285 --> 00:07:57,578
and am at peace with.

119
00:07:57,578 --> 00:07:59,622
- Really. It's fine.
- You don't sound fine.

120
00:07:59,622 --> 00:08:02,249
- You don't sound fine! I'm very fine!
- Okay, you're fine.

121
00:08:02,249 --> 00:08:03,417
This is an honor.

122
00:08:03,417 --> 00:08:07,546
Oogway chose you as his successor,
and now you must choose yours.

123
00:08:07,546 --> 00:08:10,341
Master Shifu,
I finally found something I'm good at,

124
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:12,134
and now you want to
just take it away from me?

125
00:08:12,134 --> 00:08:14,303
No one is taking anything away, Po.

126
00:08:14,303 --> 00:08:16,847
Who you are will always be
a part of what you become.

127
00:08:16,847 --> 00:08:19,600
Yeah, but where's the "skadoosh"?
You know what I mean?

128
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,352
The "shasha-booie"?

129
00:08:21,352 --> 00:08:22,853
I don't want to seem ungrateful,

130
00:08:22,853 --> 00:08:25,523
but I don't know anything
about passing on wisdom or inspiring hope.

131
00:08:25,523 --> 00:08:27,566
All I know are two things.

132
00:08:27,566 --> 00:08:30,903
Kicking butt and taking names.

133
00:08:30,903 --> 00:08:33,989
And if I'm being completely honest,
I'm not even that good at the name-taking.

134
00:08:33,989 --> 00:08:36,157
Like, who was
that fire-breathing crocodile?

135
00:08:36,157 --> 00:08:37,660
I wanna say Steve...

136
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,994
You were chosen
to bring peace to the Valley,

137
00:08:39,994 --> 00:08:44,333
and there are other ways to bring peace
than simply kicking butt.

138
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:46,502
Well, sure. But not any fun ones.

139
00:08:46,502 --> 00:08:49,838
Please. Being the Dragon Warrior
is all I know.

140
00:08:49,838 --> 00:08:52,007
- It's who I am.
- Not anymore.

141
00:08:52,007 --> 00:08:54,176
The Valley of Peace needs
a Spiritual Leader,

142
00:08:54,176 --> 00:08:56,053
and Master Oogway chose you.

143
00:08:56,053 --> 00:08:59,014
You'll start interviewing candidates
first thing tomorrow morning.

144
00:08:59,014 --> 00:09:01,517
Candidates? What candidates?

145
00:09:12,278 --> 00:09:13,737
Awesome!

146
00:09:21,036 --> 00:09:22,162
No way!

147
00:09:25,624 --> 00:09:26,834
Wow!

148
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:28,878
Skadoosh.

149
00:09:28,878 --> 00:09:30,296
Fantastic pose.

150
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:42,683
Whoo-hoo! Nice.

151
00:09:44,018 --> 00:09:49,190
Master Po will now choose
the next Dragon Warrior.

152
00:09:51,108 --> 00:09:54,069
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

153
00:09:54,069 --> 00:09:58,073
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

154
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:00,201
So many great candidates.

155
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,204
I'm gonna let the finger decide.

156
00:10:04,163 --> 00:10:06,373
Wait. Whoa. Whoa.

157
00:10:06,373 --> 00:10:08,250
What is happening?

158
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,587
The Dragon Warrior. It's me!

159
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:20,137
Like it or not, Po,
you have to choose a successor.

160
00:10:20,137 --> 00:10:24,099
Eh. Nothing about them
says "dragon" or "warrior."

161
00:10:24,099 --> 00:10:25,809
You will know when you know.

162
00:10:25,809 --> 00:10:28,604
How do I know when I know?
You know?

163
00:10:29,647 --> 00:10:33,067
When I'm conflicted, I come here
to ask the universe for answers.

164
00:10:33,651 --> 00:10:35,319
Just as Oogway did before me.

165
00:10:35,319 --> 00:10:38,364
I'm not conflicted.
I'm just not ready for a next step.

166
00:10:38,364 --> 00:10:39,573
What is that you're holding?

167
00:10:39,573 --> 00:10:41,033
The Staff of Wisdom?

168
00:10:41,033 --> 00:10:42,117
Other hand.

169
00:10:42,117 --> 00:10:43,702
A chewed-up peach pit?

170
00:10:43,702 --> 00:10:45,162
Exactly.

171
00:10:45,162 --> 00:10:49,542
Every pit holds the promise
of a mighty tree.

172
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:51,794
Uh, how is this gonna help me
find the answers?

173
00:10:51,794 --> 00:10:54,964
Don't ask me. Ask the universe.

174
00:10:54,964 --> 00:10:57,633
Be the pit, Po. Be the pit.

175
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:01,971
There we go.

176
00:11:01,971 --> 00:11:03,597
All right, universe.

177
00:11:04,723 --> 00:11:06,267
Give me some guidance.

178
00:11:07,977 --> 00:11:09,478
<i>Inner peace.</i>

179
00:11:10,354 --> 00:11:11,730
<i>Inner peace.</i>

180
00:11:12,356 --> 00:11:13,774
<i>Inner peace.</i>

181
00:11:14,275 --> 00:11:15,609
<i>Dinner, please.</i>

182
00:11:16,193 --> 00:11:17,653
<i>Dinner with peas.</i>

183
00:11:18,487 --> 00:11:19,822
<i>Snow peas?</i>

184
00:11:19,822 --> 00:11:22,074
<i>In a sesame soy glaze.</i>

185
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,493
Inner peace.

186
00:11:25,202 --> 00:11:26,370
Inner peace.

187
00:11:28,706 --> 00:11:30,541
This is not working at all.

188
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:32,209
Maybe focus on your breathing?

189
00:11:32,209 --> 00:11:34,962
I'm trying, but it's kinda hard
when you keep talking to me.

190
00:11:34,962 --> 00:11:37,798
Technically, you're talking to you,
if you think about it.

191
00:11:37,798 --> 00:11:40,551
Hey, will you two be quiet?
I'm trying to concentrate here.

192
00:11:40,551 --> 00:11:42,887
Wait, if I'm Po's inner voice,
then who are you?

193
00:11:42,887 --> 00:11:44,930
Uh, I'm Po's inner, inner voice.

194
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:46,515
How many voices do I have in there?

195
00:11:46,515 --> 00:11:48,684
- You do not want to know.
- This dirt is itchy.

196
00:11:48,684 --> 00:11:50,352
- I just love kung fu.
- What am I gonna be?

197
00:11:50,352 --> 00:11:53,189
- Are we alone in the universe?
- You guys thought it was awesome, right?

198
00:11:55,858 --> 00:11:57,276
Anyone want a cookie?

199
00:12:03,741 --> 00:12:04,742
Universe?

200
00:12:07,286 --> 00:12:08,287
Is that you?

201
00:12:26,096 --> 00:12:28,140
Attention, mysterious figure!

202
00:12:28,724 --> 00:12:32,436
The Dragon Warrior's here
to perform justice.

203
00:12:36,065 --> 00:12:38,192
I know you're in here.

204
00:12:38,192 --> 00:12:40,819
Just a matter of time before I find you.

205
00:12:42,446 --> 00:12:43,447
Ooh.

206
00:12:52,248 --> 00:12:54,542
You can't hide from justice forever.

207
00:12:59,755 --> 00:13:02,049
The Dagger of Deng Wa.

208
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:04,009
You've got excellent taste,
I'll give you that.

209
00:13:04,718 --> 00:13:06,345
But I can't give you that.
Give it back.

210
00:13:06,345 --> 00:13:08,097
If you insist.

211
00:13:19,275 --> 00:13:21,235
- Oh, no!

212
00:13:21,235 --> 00:13:24,530
He's got a walking stick.
What are you gonna do? Stroll me to death?

213
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:28,158
This stick is not for the strolling.
It's the Staff of Wisdom.

214
00:13:28,158 --> 00:13:30,828
The Dragon Warrior is gonna be mad
when he finds out you took his stick.

215
00:13:30,828 --> 00:13:32,746
I am the Dragon Warrior.

216
00:13:33,873 --> 00:13:37,209
I'm just gonna say it. Nothing about you
says "dragon" or "warrior."

217
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:49,388
Whoa.

218
00:13:50,598 --> 00:13:52,016
Hi-yah!

219
00:13:52,975 --> 00:13:56,145
How dare you desecrate the Hall of Heroes?

220
00:13:56,145 --> 00:13:57,688
Who's desecrating what now?

221
00:13:57,688 --> 00:13:59,481
Master Ostrich's Egg!

222
00:13:59,481 --> 00:14:02,193
Oops, my bad. Hi-yah!

223
00:14:02,193 --> 00:14:04,570
The Indestructible Chain Hammer
of Master Pangolin.

224
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:05,821
Whoopsies.

225
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,327
Ha-ha! [Grunts] Oh!

226
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,044
The Urn of Whispering Warriors!

227
00:14:20,044 --> 00:14:22,588
Which I've already broken! Twice!

228
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,759
Why would you keep an urn of souls?
Feels kinda creepy.

229
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,598
Are you doing okay there, big guy?
You're looking a little tired.

230
00:14:32,598 --> 00:14:34,475
- I've never felt more awake!

231
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:39,021
The War Hammer of Master Chipmunk?

232
00:14:42,608 --> 00:14:43,943
You're gonna pay for that.

233
00:14:47,613 --> 00:14:48,572
Hello?

234
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:00,626
You faker.

235
00:15:00,626 --> 00:15:02,711
It's not faking. It's called Method.

236
00:15:03,212 --> 00:15:05,005
Catch ya later, panda.

237
00:15:05,714 --> 00:15:06,840
No.

238
00:15:13,305 --> 00:15:15,057
I think I'll catch you now.

239
00:15:20,771 --> 00:15:21,856
Whoa!

240
00:15:28,612 --> 00:15:29,697
Whoa!

241
00:15:31,073 --> 00:15:32,116
Whoa!

242
00:15:35,744 --> 00:15:36,704
Told ya.

243
00:15:36,704 --> 00:15:39,832
You got me,
oh-great-and-powerful Dumpling Warrior.

244
00:15:39,832 --> 00:15:41,792
That's Dragon Warrior...

245
00:15:42,835 --> 00:15:44,336
Let go of me.

246
00:15:44,336 --> 00:15:45,671
Just tell me one thing.

247
00:15:45,671 --> 00:15:48,090
How did someone like you
become the Dragon Warrior?

248
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:50,384
That's a mystery for you to solve
during your two-year stay

249
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:51,802
at the Valley of Peace prison.

250
00:15:51,802 --> 00:15:54,763
Valley of Peace prison?
Sounds like a day care.

251
00:15:54,763 --> 00:15:56,515
It is a day care on the weekends.

252
00:15:57,099 --> 00:15:58,726
But it's also a prison.

253
00:15:58,726 --> 00:15:59,935
There he is!

254
00:15:59,935 --> 00:16:00,978
Dragon Warrior!

255
00:16:00,978 --> 00:16:02,980
- Tai Lung is back.
- Tai Lung has returned?

256
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:06,150
He demanded all of our iron,
then destroyed our quarry.

257
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,736
- He's supposed to be in the Spirit Realm.
- Well, he's back.

258
00:16:08,736 --> 00:16:11,614
He said that he's not gonna stop
until the Valley of Peace falls

259
00:16:11,614 --> 00:16:13,949
and the Dragon Warrior
bows before him.

260
00:16:13,949 --> 00:16:16,118
- He's back.
- Please, you've got to do something.

261
00:16:16,827 --> 00:16:20,164
Looks like I'm not the only one
around here with a mystery to solve.

262
00:16:20,164 --> 00:16:22,166
Well, you know what they say...

263
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:27,004
every step leaves a footprint,
no matter how small.

264
00:16:46,273 --> 00:16:51,195
Every step leaves a footprint,
no matter how small.

265
00:16:56,283 --> 00:16:58,619
Very clever, fox. You know something.

266
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:00,788
Maybe I do, maybe I don't.

267
00:17:01,288 --> 00:17:03,165
Okay, I do. I really, really do.

268
00:17:03,165 --> 00:17:04,833
- Tell me.
- And why should I?

269
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:06,043
I mean, what's in it for me?

270
00:17:06,043 --> 00:17:08,128
The peace of mind
knowing you did the right thing.

271
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:10,673
You're adorable.
Has anyone ever told you that?

272
00:17:10,673 --> 00:17:12,466
And I don't mean just in, like,
the cuddly sense.

273
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:13,759
I don't have time for games.

274
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:15,928
Tai Lung is running loose
in the Valley of Peace.

275
00:17:15,928 --> 00:17:20,099
Maybe. Or maybe she wants you to think
it was Tai Lung.

276
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:21,350
Wait. She?

277
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:22,643
Mine!

278
00:17:23,477 --> 00:17:26,689
The Empress of Disguise,
capable of taking any form,

279
00:17:26,689 --> 00:17:27,981
<i>mimicking any shape.</i>

280
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:29,108
<i>The master of deception.</i>

281
00:17:29,108 --> 00:17:31,485
<i>The lizard of lies
with the glowing teal eyes.</i>

282
00:17:31,485 --> 00:17:32,695
<i>I'm talking 'bout...</i>

283
00:17:33,404 --> 00:17:35,447
The Chameleon.

284
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:39,702
This is kind of a private conversation.

285
00:17:40,911 --> 00:17:42,454
Who's The Chameleon?

286
00:17:42,454 --> 00:17:44,832
Only the most powerful
shape-shifting sorceress.

287
00:17:44,832 --> 00:17:47,293
So she shape-shifted into Tai Lung.

288
00:17:47,793 --> 00:17:49,962
But what does she have against me
and the Valley of Peace?

289
00:17:49,962 --> 00:17:52,131
These are good questions.
You should ask her.

290
00:17:52,131 --> 00:17:56,051
You're right.
How do I find this "The Chameleon"?

291
00:17:56,051 --> 00:17:57,720
She isn't someone who can be found.

292
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,514
At least not without someone in the know.

293
00:18:00,514 --> 00:18:03,392
And how do I find someone "in the know"?

294
00:18:03,392 --> 00:18:06,478
Oh! It's me.
It's obviously... It's me.

295
00:18:06,478 --> 00:18:07,771
I'm in the know.

296
00:18:07,771 --> 00:18:10,316
Forget it. I'll find her on my own.

297
00:18:10,941 --> 00:18:11,942
Good luck.

298
00:18:11,942 --> 00:18:15,112
After all, how hard can it be
to find someone who can look like anyone,

299
00:18:15,112 --> 00:18:16,405
blend in anywhere?

300
00:18:20,034 --> 00:18:22,369
Fine. You lead me to The Chameleon,

301
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:24,747
and I'll see what I can do
about reducing your sentence.

302
00:18:24,747 --> 00:18:26,040
Deal.

303
00:18:27,124 --> 00:18:28,250
Po!

304
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:29,543
What do you think you're doing?

305
00:18:29,543 --> 00:18:33,005
There's this shape-shifting
sorceress on the loose and...

306
00:18:33,005 --> 00:18:35,090
That's a job for the Furious Five.

307
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:38,135
Well, they're not here, and someone
needs to protect the Valley of Peace.

308
00:18:38,135 --> 00:18:40,012
Look, I know that change is difficult

309
00:18:40,012 --> 00:18:42,556
and that you enjoy
being the Dragon Warrior,

310
00:18:42,556 --> 00:18:45,017
but your job is finding a successor.

311
00:18:45,017 --> 00:18:48,479
The Dragon Warrior and I have a deal.
Mind your own business, squirrel.

312
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:50,189
Master Shifu is not a squirrel.

313
00:18:50,189 --> 00:18:51,440
I'm a red panda.

314
00:18:52,816 --> 00:18:54,568
You know what? I love that for you.

315
00:18:54,568 --> 00:18:56,195
Po, this is your decision.

316
00:18:56,195 --> 00:19:00,658
But I think you know what choice
Master Oogway would want you to make.

317
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:07,414
- Thanks for the free stay.
- What are you doing?

318
00:19:07,414 --> 00:19:08,832
- Little dank for a day care.
- Wait!

319
00:19:08,832 --> 00:19:10,376
- Not bad for a jail.
- Where is she going?

320
00:19:10,376 --> 00:19:11,460
You can't leave.

321
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,713
Don't worry, I'll have her back
before you even know she was gone.

322
00:19:14,713 --> 00:19:17,925
You are supposed to be
passing along wisdom and inspiring hope!

323
00:19:17,925 --> 00:19:20,678
Just think of it as
one last Dragon Warrior adventure.

324
00:19:20,678 --> 00:19:23,055
I'll be back soon.
Tell my dads I love 'em.

325
00:19:23,055 --> 00:19:25,391
- I can't hear you anymore! Bye!

326
00:19:28,102 --> 00:19:31,438
Yeah! It sure is good
to be a free fox again.

327
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:33,107
That's a good back scratcher.

328
00:19:33,107 --> 00:19:34,441
- Yoink!
- Hey!

329
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:36,694
So, does this really unlock the door
to the Spirit Realm?

330
00:19:36,694 --> 00:19:38,320
It doesn't work like that.

331
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,115
It has to be given
in order to gain its powers.

332
00:19:41,115 --> 00:19:44,076
Gotcha. Given to gain.
So, can I have it?

333
00:19:44,076 --> 00:19:45,828
No! What do you take me for?

334
00:19:45,828 --> 00:19:46,912
An easy mark.

335
00:19:46,912 --> 00:19:47,997
What's an easy mark?

336
00:19:47,997 --> 00:19:49,665
Someone who's easy to steal from,

337
00:19:49,665 --> 00:19:51,876
usually because they're generous
and too trusting.

338
00:19:51,876 --> 00:19:54,044
- Like you.
- Aw, thank you.

339
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:00,759
I heard The Chameleon is a monster
with an appetite of a thousand predators,

340
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:02,887
and her favorite food is panda.

341
00:20:02,887 --> 00:20:06,682
They say this Chameleon character
has magical powers.

342
00:20:06,682 --> 00:20:10,436
If you say her name three times,
she'll take you away in the night!

343
00:20:11,979 --> 00:20:15,900
The Chameleon can shape-shift
to look like anyone, even you.

344
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,401
Or you.

345
00:20:20,738 --> 00:20:22,990
Mr. Li! Mr. Li! Is it true?

346
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:25,784
Po's going to
take down an evil sorceress?

347
00:20:25,784 --> 00:20:27,745
The... The Chameleon?

348
00:20:27,745 --> 00:20:31,081
Well, a Dragon Warrior's work
is never done.

349
00:20:31,081 --> 00:20:34,335
Li, I'm thinking Po teaming up
with a convicted felon

350
00:20:34,335 --> 00:20:38,214
to take down an evil sorceress
wasn't such a great idea.

351
00:20:38,214 --> 00:20:43,177
Relax. Po has faced demons, demigods,
and everything else in between.

352
00:20:43,177 --> 00:20:44,386
He's always come out on top.

353
00:20:44,386 --> 00:20:46,597
You're right. You're right.

354
00:20:46,597 --> 00:20:48,474
But what if you're wrong?

355
00:20:48,474 --> 00:20:50,226
Calm down, Ping.

356
00:20:50,226 --> 00:20:53,229
How bad can one evil sorceress be?

357
00:20:55,189 --> 00:20:57,650
Who is she to summon us?

358
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:58,901
Classic power move.

359
00:20:58,901 --> 00:21:02,279
We're the heads of Juniper City's
most prominent crime families.

360
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:05,908
And she's just some bug-eyed,
power-hungry reptilian runt.

361
00:21:05,908 --> 00:21:07,618
You left out the evil sorceress part.

362
00:21:07,618 --> 00:21:09,495
We used to run this city.

363
00:21:09,495 --> 00:21:12,081
Now we pay her half the money we swindle.

364
00:21:12,081 --> 00:21:14,667
It's like a criminal can't
make an honest living anymore.

365
00:21:14,667 --> 00:21:16,168
Yeah, but what could we do?

366
00:21:17,086 --> 00:21:19,380
Together, we can take her down.

367
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,299
- Are you nuts? She's a shape-shifter.

368
00:21:22,299 --> 00:21:26,303
She could be at this very table,
and we'd have no idea.

369
00:21:27,846 --> 00:21:30,182
For all we know,
you're The Chameleon.

370
00:21:30,182 --> 00:21:32,101
Or you're The Chameleon.

371
00:21:32,101 --> 00:21:33,853
- Or maybe...
- Oh, no.

372
00:21:33,853 --> 00:21:35,229
- Maybe...
- Don't say it.

373
00:21:35,855 --> 00:21:37,523
...I'm The Chameleon.

374
00:21:37,523 --> 00:21:38,732
I said don't say it.

375
00:21:46,323 --> 00:21:48,158
We obviously spoke out of turn.

376
00:21:48,158 --> 00:21:49,243
Sorry, Chameleon.

377
00:21:49,243 --> 00:21:51,120
No, no. Don't apologize.

378
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:55,624
You and your families prospered
by preying upon the weak,

379
00:21:55,624 --> 00:21:59,378
so it doesn't feel good
when you're the one being squeezed.

380
00:21:59,378 --> 00:22:02,047
Especially when the one
doing the squeezing

381
00:22:02,047 --> 00:22:05,551
is just a "bug-eyed, power-hungry"...

382
00:22:05,551 --> 00:22:07,136
What was the rest?

383
00:22:07,136 --> 00:22:09,054
Reptilian runt.

384
00:22:09,054 --> 00:22:13,225
Well, this "reptilian runt" wants more.

385
00:22:13,225 --> 00:22:15,269
You already have the city.

386
00:22:15,269 --> 00:22:17,229
What else could you possibly want?

387
00:22:17,229 --> 00:22:21,317
I have something special in mind.
I'm very close to achieving it.

388
00:22:21,317 --> 00:22:24,111
As close as the blood moon.

389
00:22:24,111 --> 00:22:25,779
But the blood moon
is two nights away.

390
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:28,407
So little time, so many expenses.

391
00:22:28,407 --> 00:22:33,829
Which is why I'll need to increase
this month's tribute to 60%.

392
00:22:33,829 --> 00:22:34,955
No.

393
00:22:39,877 --> 00:22:41,337
What was that now?

394
00:22:41,921 --> 00:22:44,423
I mean no disrespect.

395
00:22:46,175 --> 00:22:47,718
Don't worry.

396
00:22:47,718 --> 00:22:53,682
I forgive you for the impudence
and the backstabbing.

397
00:22:53,682 --> 00:22:59,104
And the blatant disrespect
you've shown me, I forgive.

398
00:22:59,688 --> 00:23:01,982
But I never forget.

399
00:23:01,982 --> 00:23:04,276
You might say I have the memory...

400
00:23:04,276 --> 00:23:05,486
Oh, don't say it.

401
00:23:05,486 --> 00:23:07,613
...of an elephant.

402
00:23:23,379 --> 00:23:26,632
You think
I've pushed you too far?

403
00:23:26,632 --> 00:23:30,803
Then you, my friend, can't begin to fathom

404
00:23:30,803 --> 00:23:34,640
just how far I can push.

405
00:23:40,646 --> 00:23:43,732
I'll expect your tributes by dawn.

406
00:23:47,528 --> 00:23:49,697
Are we gonna stop
for lunch soon?

407
00:23:49,697 --> 00:23:51,782
Justice doesn't stop for lunch.

408
00:23:51,782 --> 00:23:54,660
But it does take the occasional time-out
for snackage.

409
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,453
Wanna split my almond cookie?

410
00:23:56,453 --> 00:24:00,040
You're just gonna give me half of your
cookie out of the goodness of your heart?

411
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,418
- Mm-hmm.
- What's the catch? The rub? The bamboozle?

412
00:24:02,418 --> 00:24:03,377
The "bam-what-le"?

413
00:24:03,377 --> 00:24:05,421
You know, the fleece.
The rook. The flimflam.

414
00:24:05,421 --> 00:24:07,006
Do you want the cookie or not?

415
00:24:10,885 --> 00:24:12,469
I got my eye on you.

416
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:16,974
How much farther is it
to this "The Chameleon"?

417
00:24:16,974 --> 00:24:18,183
Just a little farther.

418
00:24:33,073 --> 00:24:36,619
Li! What are you doing out here
in the middle of the night?

419
00:24:36,619 --> 00:24:40,289
Well, I... I... I... didn't wanna miss
the blood moon rising.

420
00:24:40,289 --> 00:24:43,042
Oh, pooh.
You are just as worried as I am.

421
00:24:43,042 --> 00:24:44,460
All right, all right.

422
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:47,296
I know pandas come across as
calm, gentle and chill,

423
00:24:47,296 --> 00:24:49,632
but... [chuckles] ...the truth is

424
00:24:49,632 --> 00:24:51,217
I'm kinda freaking out!

425
00:24:51,217 --> 00:24:52,259
So am I.

426
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:56,555
Po is just too calm, gentle and chill
to face a shape-shifting sorceress.

427
00:24:56,555 --> 00:24:59,433
- What if he's captured?
- What if he's tortured?

428
00:24:59,433 --> 00:25:01,352
Our baby!

429
00:25:02,478 --> 00:25:03,938
Okay, okay.

430
00:25:03,938 --> 00:25:06,190
Maybe Po has finally met his match,

431
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:10,152
but there is still something that he has
that The Chameleon does not.

432
00:25:10,152 --> 00:25:12,279
- What's that?
- Us.

433
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:15,199
Now, let's go find our son.

434
00:25:15,199 --> 00:25:16,408
I hope Po's okay.

435
00:25:16,408 --> 00:25:19,453
You know, Li,
a wise goose once said,

436
00:25:19,453 --> 00:25:22,498
"Worrying doesn't make
the broth boil any faster."

437
00:25:22,498 --> 00:25:25,000
Who was that idiot?
Me, of course.

438
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,544
I was the wise goose.

439
00:25:26,544 --> 00:25:28,295
Oh, yeah.

440
00:25:28,295 --> 00:25:30,214
Whoa.

441
00:25:30,214 --> 00:25:32,258
That's the biggest village I've ever seen.

442
00:25:32,258 --> 00:25:34,051
That's no village.

443
00:25:34,051 --> 00:25:36,011
That's Juniper City.

444
00:25:36,011 --> 00:25:37,846
That's where I'll find
The Chameleon, huh?

445
00:25:37,846 --> 00:25:39,390
Just a boat ride away.

446
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,976
And I'm gonna lead you
right to her front door.

447
00:25:41,976 --> 00:25:43,936
Are you sure we'll find
a boat captain in there?

448
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:46,814
For the right price, those cutthroats will
take us anywhere we want to go.

449
00:25:47,398 --> 00:25:50,526
Of course, we could always opt for
the four-finger discount.

450
00:25:50,526 --> 00:25:51,819
No stealing.

451
00:25:52,695 --> 00:25:54,321
"The Happy Bunny Tavern".

452
00:25:54,321 --> 00:25:56,198
Well, that sounds inviting.

453
00:26:01,203 --> 00:26:03,122
Anybody lose a rabbit?

454
00:26:09,336 --> 00:26:10,629
Stir faster!

455
00:26:12,965 --> 00:26:16,135
Welcome to the Happy Bunny Tavern.

456
00:26:16,135 --> 00:26:18,971
I'll find us a ride.
Maybe you can get us some food.

457
00:26:19,513 --> 00:26:20,931
And stay out of trouble.

458
00:26:23,142 --> 00:26:24,560
Hey, what you guys playing?

459
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,312
Mah-jongg.

460
00:26:26,312 --> 00:26:27,980
And the stakes are high.

461
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,064
Can I play?

462
00:26:29,064 --> 00:26:32,484
Surely you'll go easy on a beginner,
'cause I'm very beginning.

463
00:26:34,153 --> 00:26:36,363
- Hey there.
- What can I get you?

464
00:26:36,363 --> 00:26:38,240
A boat ride to Juniper City.

465
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,325
Ask this guy.

466
00:26:41,869 --> 00:26:43,871
- Who's he?
- He's the captain.

467
00:26:43,871 --> 00:26:45,414
- Thanks.

468
00:26:48,542 --> 00:26:51,337
Oh, I win again.
Beginner's luck, I guess.

469
00:26:51,337 --> 00:26:53,214
Never played before, huh?

470
00:26:53,214 --> 00:26:55,216
I'm sorry, are you accusing me
of cheating?

471
00:26:55,216 --> 00:26:57,509
I would like to speak
to the manager, please.

472
00:26:57,509 --> 00:26:59,511
I am the manager.

473
00:27:00,054 --> 00:27:04,225
I'll give you a boat ride to Juniper City,
but I won't carry anything illegal.

474
00:27:04,225 --> 00:27:05,601
I don't want any trouble.

475
00:27:05,601 --> 00:27:07,561
Trouble runs from me.

476
00:27:07,561 --> 00:27:09,021
Then it'll cost you double.

477
00:27:09,021 --> 00:27:11,565
I'm confused.
Should I have said that I like trouble?

478
00:27:11,565 --> 00:27:13,400
In that case, it'll cost you triple.

479
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,070
Oh. Uh, maybe we can go back
to the double price?

480
00:27:19,073 --> 00:27:20,491
You got a deal.

481
00:27:20,491 --> 00:27:23,452
Great.
Do I shake his hand or your hand?

482
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:25,871
Can I get anything else for you, ma'am?

483
00:27:25,871 --> 00:27:27,331
Yes. Everything, again.

484
00:27:27,331 --> 00:27:29,375
Except for the broth. It was very bland.

485
00:27:29,375 --> 00:27:30,960
- Keep stirring!

486
00:27:32,461 --> 00:27:35,130
Whoa! One of everything is my go-to order.

487
00:27:35,923 --> 00:27:37,174
But how did you pay for this?

488
00:27:37,174 --> 00:27:39,134
Legally. Lawfully. Fair and square.

489
00:27:39,134 --> 00:27:40,594
- I'm proud of you.

490
00:27:51,605 --> 00:27:52,690
Oh, wow! Look at the time.

491
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:55,609
Remember we have to do that thing
down by the place with that guy?

492
00:27:55,609 --> 00:28:00,114
Did you actually think you could
grift a meal out of me?

493
00:28:00,114 --> 00:28:03,158
There's gotta be some sort
of misunderstanding here.

494
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:07,580
And apparently,
I'm the one misunderstanding.

495
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:10,708
Please allow us to pay for our meal
and yours too.

496
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:12,710
I'm only hungry for...

497
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:14,169
- Dumplings?
- ...vengeance!

498
00:28:14,169 --> 00:28:16,130
Well, then, come and get it.

499
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,132
No! No, no, no! Don't come and get it!

500
00:28:18,132 --> 00:28:20,175
- Destroy them!

501
00:28:32,855 --> 00:28:33,898
I got it!

502
00:28:44,283 --> 00:28:45,409
There you go.

503
00:28:47,286 --> 00:28:48,829
- All better.

504
00:28:48,829 --> 00:28:51,582
- Come on! Gotcha.

505
00:28:51,582 --> 00:28:52,833
Keep stirring!

506
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,718
Oh, yeah!

507
00:29:21,737 --> 00:29:22,988
I'll take that.

508
00:29:26,075 --> 00:29:27,368
Think this belongs to you.

509
00:29:40,339 --> 00:29:41,840
No stealing!

510
00:29:46,387 --> 00:29:49,098
Yeah, I think it's
a little too late for that.

511
00:29:49,098 --> 00:29:51,392
It's never too late to do the right thing.

512
00:29:51,392 --> 00:29:53,018
- Get them!

513
00:29:53,018 --> 00:29:54,770
- Watch out!
- Whoa!

514
00:30:02,111 --> 00:30:03,988
- Skadoosh!

515
00:30:10,494 --> 00:30:14,206
- Whoa. Nice move. You gotta teach me that.

516
00:30:14,206 --> 00:30:16,333
You die, panda!

517
00:30:29,597 --> 00:30:30,806
Ah! Uh.

518
00:30:31,348 --> 00:30:33,309
Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

519
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:37,396
Who designs a tavern on a cliff?

520
00:30:37,396 --> 00:30:40,107
I shouldn't have eaten
all those dumplings.

521
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:42,693
- Huh?

522
00:30:42,693 --> 00:30:43,944
Uh-oh.

523
00:30:48,616 --> 00:30:49,909
Sail ho!

524
00:30:56,498 --> 00:30:59,418
Back up! Move, move, move!

525
00:31:02,713 --> 00:31:04,757
- Not that I'm worried, but...

526
00:31:04,757 --> 00:31:07,176
...what if The Chameleon knows
we're coming?

527
00:31:07,176 --> 00:31:09,386
Why, she could be anywhere, anyone.

528
00:31:09,386 --> 00:31:12,264
Li, would you please show
a little backbone?

529
00:31:12,264 --> 00:31:15,768
I'm sorry, but bravery was never
really my specialty.

530
00:31:15,768 --> 00:31:20,564
You don't have to be brave.
You just have to act brave.

531
00:31:20,564 --> 00:31:22,733
Act brave? Got it.

532
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,402
- Ah!
- Oh!

533
00:31:25,402 --> 00:31:26,820
Oh, Li!

534
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,198
- Hold on!

535
00:31:29,198 --> 00:31:32,034
Hold me, Ping! It's all been for nothing!

536
00:31:32,034 --> 00:31:33,536
Please, no.

537
00:31:33,536 --> 00:31:35,955
- I'm too young!

538
00:31:39,542 --> 00:31:41,252
How was that for acting brave?

539
00:31:41,252 --> 00:31:43,170
Keep working on it.

540
00:31:47,216 --> 00:31:49,426
Juniper City.

541
00:31:49,426 --> 00:31:51,345
It's going to be great
to be back home again.

542
00:31:51,345 --> 00:31:53,347
Does your family live there too?

543
00:31:53,347 --> 00:31:55,683
They would. If I had a family.

544
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,853
It wasn't easy being a little fox
in a big city.

545
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:02,022
<i>So I had to survive any way I could.</i>

546
00:32:02,022 --> 00:32:03,065
Hey!

547
00:32:03,065 --> 00:32:06,193
<i>Grifting. Shilling. Gaffing.</i>

548
00:32:06,193 --> 00:32:08,821
Stop running! Stop running!

549
00:32:14,535 --> 00:32:16,912
Whoa, you're an orphan? So am I.

550
00:32:16,912 --> 00:32:18,372
Well, I mean I was.

551
00:32:18,372 --> 00:32:22,293
My goose dad adopted me,
and then later, my panda dad found me.

552
00:32:22,293 --> 00:32:26,005
Goose dads, panda dads.
Guess it takes all kinds.

553
00:32:26,005 --> 00:32:27,548
- Right, Mom?

554
00:32:28,299 --> 00:32:30,426
Then, one day, a local took me in.

555
00:32:30,426 --> 00:32:33,888
Put a roof over my head,
gave me clothes to wear, food to eat.

556
00:32:33,888 --> 00:32:36,265
After that, I was never alone again.

557
00:32:36,265 --> 00:32:37,474
I guess we both got lucky.

558
00:32:37,474 --> 00:32:38,517
I guess.

559
00:32:38,517 --> 00:32:40,895
Hey, tell me something.
Back in the Valley of Geese...

560
00:32:40,895 --> 00:32:41,937
Peace.

561
00:32:41,937 --> 00:32:43,439
...what did that angry little squirrel
mean...

562
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:44,356
Red panda.

563
00:32:44,356 --> 00:32:46,400
...when he said you had to
find your successor?

564
00:32:47,568 --> 00:32:49,987
Now that I'm supposed to become
Spiritual Leader,

565
00:32:49,987 --> 00:32:53,073
I have to find a worthy successor
to take over as the Dragon Warrior.

566
00:32:53,073 --> 00:32:55,242
Once you're on top,
that's where you wanna stay, right?

567
00:32:55,242 --> 00:32:58,329
No, it's just that... What do I know
about being a Spiritual Leader?

568
00:32:58,329 --> 00:33:00,873
I can't even come up with
one of those cool-sounding proverbs.

569
00:33:00,873 --> 00:33:03,542
"Life's greatest enemy is"...

570
00:33:03,542 --> 00:33:05,753
Uh, I don't know. Stairs?

571
00:33:06,337 --> 00:33:07,463
Okay.

572
00:33:07,463 --> 00:33:09,840
Everyone knows
life's greatest enemy is time.

573
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,886
I guess it's just easier to hold on
to the life you know

574
00:33:13,886 --> 00:33:15,387
than move on to the one you don't.

575
00:33:15,387 --> 00:33:17,181
Hey, that was pretty good.

576
00:33:17,181 --> 00:33:18,098
Yeah.

577
00:33:18,098 --> 00:33:21,936
Maybe she should be the Spiritual Leader
of the Valley of Geese.

578
00:33:23,854 --> 00:33:25,898
Whoa, that guy.
He drinks like a fish.

579
00:33:25,898 --> 00:33:27,441
Should he be driving?

580
00:33:52,466 --> 00:33:55,594
We've come to pay tribute,
as you requested.

581
00:33:55,594 --> 00:33:57,471
Looks a little light.

582
00:33:57,471 --> 00:33:59,348
Go back out and get me more!

583
00:33:59,348 --> 00:34:00,266
More?

584
00:34:00,266 --> 00:34:01,433
But... But, Chameleon...

585
00:34:01,433 --> 00:34:05,062
Go! Before I toss you
down another flight of stairs.

586
00:34:07,898 --> 00:34:11,193
At last, my destiny approaches.

587
00:34:14,905 --> 00:34:20,410
I'll expand my rule from Juniper City
to every city and town and village

588
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:24,039
from here to the Valley of Peace
and beyond!

589
00:34:28,419 --> 00:34:33,339
They will all know the name
of The Chameleon!

590
00:34:33,339 --> 00:34:34,675
<i>Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!</i>

591
00:34:34,675 --> 00:34:38,888
Ah! Zhen! I had a vision.
I saw The Chameleon.

592
00:34:38,888 --> 00:34:41,932
She's gonna take over cities and towns
and the Valley of Peace.

593
00:34:41,932 --> 00:34:43,642
A vision?

594
00:34:43,642 --> 00:34:45,185
While you were asleep?

595
00:34:45,185 --> 00:34:46,604
I'm pretty sure that's just a dream.

596
00:34:46,604 --> 00:34:48,397
Not a dream, a vision.

597
00:34:48,397 --> 00:34:50,482
Either I had a bad dumpling
before I went to sleep,

598
00:34:50,482 --> 00:34:52,318
or it's a Dragon Warrior thing.

599
00:34:52,318 --> 00:34:54,320
We got to get to The Chameleon
and take her down.

600
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,280
Well, then you're in luck.

601
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,449
Welcome to Juniper City.

602
00:35:03,662 --> 00:35:05,080
Whoa!

603
00:35:07,541 --> 00:35:10,377
This is the place where you can be
whatever you wanna be,

604
00:35:10,377 --> 00:35:12,671
do whatever you wanna do,

605
00:35:12,671 --> 00:35:15,966
and steal whatever you wanna steal.

606
00:35:15,966 --> 00:35:17,051
Uh, if that's your thing.

607
00:35:17,051 --> 00:35:20,679
Land ho!

608
00:35:21,931 --> 00:35:23,891
Whoa. That came out of nowhere.

609
00:35:34,318 --> 00:35:35,194
Ah!

610
00:35:36,403 --> 00:35:37,571
- Whoa!
- Move!

611
00:35:37,571 --> 00:35:39,323
- Look out!
- Sorry!

612
00:35:39,323 --> 00:35:40,407
Out of the way!

613
00:35:41,242 --> 00:35:43,202
I've never seen so much traffic before.

614
00:35:43,202 --> 00:35:45,287
You don't have rush hour
in the Valley of Peace?

615
00:35:45,287 --> 00:35:47,581
No one's ever in that much of a rush. Oof.

616
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,626
Come on!

617
00:35:55,256 --> 00:35:57,174
Well, sure is good to be home again.

618
00:35:57,174 --> 00:35:59,009
The sights. The sounds.

619
00:35:59,009 --> 00:36:01,720
The smells.

620
00:36:05,933 --> 00:36:09,562
It's a wonton wonderland!

621
00:36:11,689 --> 00:36:12,731
Yeah!

622
00:36:16,026 --> 00:36:17,653
Po. Po!

623
00:36:17,653 --> 00:36:19,154
Focus!

624
00:36:19,154 --> 00:36:21,240
This city is the most amazing place
I've ever seen!

625
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,618
I used to feel the same way
until The Chameleon got her claws into it.

626
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,007
Tonight, we take down The Chameleon.

627
00:36:38,007 --> 00:36:39,133
Oh, yeah.

628
00:36:39,133 --> 00:36:42,803
I'll show you where this villainous
sorceress lurks as she dominates the city.

629
00:36:42,803 --> 00:36:45,848
Is she lurking in that villainous tower
dominating the city?

630
00:36:47,641 --> 00:36:48,642
How'd you know?

631
00:36:48,642 --> 00:36:50,644
Eh, not my first time
taking down a villain.

632
00:36:50,644 --> 00:36:51,729
Let's keep moving.

633
00:36:51,729 --> 00:36:53,147
- Hey, Zhen!
- Heya, Zhen.

634
00:36:53,147 --> 00:36:54,315
Long time no see.

635
00:36:54,315 --> 00:36:55,232
How you doing, Zhen?

636
00:36:55,232 --> 00:36:57,484
Wow, you're quite the local celeb.

637
00:36:57,484 --> 00:37:00,738
Yeah, well, let's just say
a face like mine is hard to forget.

638
00:37:03,449 --> 00:37:05,576
What? You're a wanted criminal?

639
00:37:05,576 --> 00:37:09,163
You sound surprised. Is this surprising?
I don't think this is surprising.

640
00:37:09,163 --> 00:37:11,165
You never mentioned
you were wanted.

641
00:37:11,165 --> 00:37:12,499
Don't worry.

642
00:37:12,499 --> 00:37:14,710
The law has better things to do
than look for me.

643
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:17,338
- Hey, fox.
- We've been looking for you.

644
00:37:17,338 --> 00:37:18,464
Must be a slow workweek.

645
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,715
I'll handle this.

646
00:37:19,715 --> 00:37:22,885
Morning, officers.
Dragon Warrior here.

647
00:37:22,885 --> 00:37:26,347
The fox and I are here
on official Dragon Warrior biz.

648
00:37:26,347 --> 00:37:27,973
- Dragon who?
- Warrior what?

649
00:37:27,973 --> 00:37:29,433
Dragon Warrior.

650
00:37:29,433 --> 00:37:31,727
Anyone? Nothing?

651
00:37:31,727 --> 00:37:33,729
Perhaps you know me better as...

652
00:37:34,396 --> 00:37:36,857
the Kung Fu Panda!

653
00:37:38,025 --> 00:37:39,902
- Wait, wait!

654
00:37:39,902 --> 00:37:41,779
Can you believe that guy?

655
00:37:41,779 --> 00:37:42,947
Aw, come on!

656
00:37:42,947 --> 00:37:46,242
Okay, so we tried it your way.
Now we try it mine.

657
00:37:47,868 --> 00:37:52,665
- Wait, what's your way...

658
00:37:52,665 --> 00:37:53,749
Sorry.

659
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:56,835
Come on, come on, come on, come on!

660
00:37:57,461 --> 00:38:00,047
You can't run away from the law.
You're a wanted criminal!

661
00:38:00,047 --> 00:38:02,758
Yeah? Well, it looks like
I'm not the only one.

662
00:38:02,758 --> 00:38:05,052
Wow. City life really is fast-paced.

663
00:38:05,052 --> 00:38:07,012
We gotta get out of here
before they call for...

664
00:38:09,265 --> 00:38:10,558
...backup.

665
00:38:15,312 --> 00:38:16,730
That's a lot of bull.

666
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:18,274
- Run!

667
00:38:24,989 --> 00:38:26,866
- Let's go, let's go!
- Oh!

668
00:38:35,916 --> 00:38:37,209
Ow!

669
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,821
Let's go.

670
00:39:07,323 --> 00:39:09,533
Whoa! Whoa!

671
00:39:12,077 --> 00:39:13,746
I'm falling...

672
00:39:13,746 --> 00:39:15,581
very slowly.

673
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:19,668
Ow!

674
00:39:31,096 --> 00:39:32,348
Sorry.

675
00:39:48,697 --> 00:39:49,657
Whew.

676
00:39:57,122 --> 00:39:58,123
There they are!

677
00:39:59,959 --> 00:40:02,211
We don't have time for a drum solo!

678
00:40:03,837 --> 00:40:05,256
We're trapped.

679
00:40:17,601 --> 00:40:18,686
It isn't much farther now.

680
00:40:18,686 --> 00:40:21,355
You always say that,
and it's always so much farther.

681
00:40:23,649 --> 00:40:26,485
Whoa. What is this place?

682
00:40:26,485 --> 00:40:27,945
Home sweet home.

683
00:40:27,945 --> 00:40:31,532
Some of the best crooks and criminals
in all of Juniper City live here.

684
00:40:33,659 --> 00:40:37,079
Careful. These guys will steal your pants
right off ya, and you'll never know it.

685
00:40:40,457 --> 00:40:41,792
Uh-oh.

686
00:40:41,792 --> 00:40:44,044
Now, you kids be careful
with those fireworks.

687
00:40:48,674 --> 00:40:49,758
Ooh!

688
00:40:55,055 --> 00:40:56,181
Ow!

689
00:41:00,561 --> 00:41:03,480
Oh!

690
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,733
So you're friends
with all these people?

691
00:41:05,733 --> 00:41:07,026
They're practically family.

692
00:41:07,026 --> 00:41:08,360
Zhen!

693
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:15,701
Oh! Is that really you?

694
00:41:15,701 --> 00:41:18,162
Han, my old mentor.

695
00:41:18,162 --> 00:41:21,123
I always knew someday you'll find your way
home back to the den.

696
00:41:21,123 --> 00:41:22,583
And when you did...

697
00:41:24,168 --> 00:41:27,213
...I'd be sure to give you
a proper homecoming.

698
00:41:27,213 --> 00:41:28,547
Family, huh?

699
00:41:28,547 --> 00:41:29,882
More like distant cousins.

700
00:41:29,882 --> 00:41:31,800
All right. How should we do this?

701
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:34,970
Quick and painless?
Or slow and painful?

702
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:38,390
Slow and painful.
Slow and painful.

703
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:41,143
All right, you little scamps.
Slow and painful it is.

704
00:41:41,143 --> 00:41:42,686
- Hooray!
- Yay!

705
00:41:42,686 --> 00:41:44,271
You really don't wanna do this.

706
00:41:44,271 --> 00:41:45,356
And why is that?

707
00:41:45,356 --> 00:41:47,608
Because if you so much as
lay one claw on me,

708
00:41:47,608 --> 00:41:49,276
you're gonna have to answer to...

709
00:41:49,985 --> 00:41:51,987
the Dragon Warrior.

710
00:41:51,987 --> 00:41:54,615
Warrior, warrior, warrior,
warrior, warrior.

711
00:41:55,908 --> 00:41:56,909
Who?

712
00:41:59,328 --> 00:42:02,623
Oh, man. Are my adventures
really that regional?

713
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:04,041
Introduce them, Po,

714
00:42:04,959 --> 00:42:07,127
to your fists.

715
00:42:12,174 --> 00:42:16,387
Remember, Po, there are other ways
to bring peace than by kicking butt.

716
00:42:16,387 --> 00:42:18,389
Ah, come on. Really? Now?

717
00:42:18,389 --> 00:42:20,266
Yes, now.

718
00:42:20,266 --> 00:42:23,602
Hold on. Shouldn't my inner Shifus
have differing opinions?

719
00:42:23,602 --> 00:42:24,979
We are in total agreement...

720
00:42:24,979 --> 00:42:26,981
...with our mutual disappointment...

721
00:42:26,981 --> 00:42:28,148
...in you.

722
00:42:29,984 --> 00:42:30,985
Wait.

723
00:42:32,236 --> 00:42:35,656
He who resorts to violence now...

724
00:42:36,866 --> 00:42:40,202
will only find more violence later.

725
00:42:40,202 --> 00:42:41,161
Huh?

726
00:42:42,663 --> 00:42:46,709
So what you're saying is,
if we don't hurt Zhen a little now...

727
00:42:46,709 --> 00:42:48,669
We can hurt her a lot later.

728
00:42:48,669 --> 00:42:50,504
What? No, that's not what I said.

729
00:42:50,504 --> 00:42:54,550
Yes! And more violence later
is better than less violence now.

730
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:56,927
No, no. I think you're misunderstanding
the fundamental point of...

731
00:42:56,927 --> 00:42:58,345
- More violence!
- Hooray!

732
00:42:58,345 --> 00:43:00,931
Violence makes my tummy tingle.

733
00:43:00,931 --> 00:43:03,058
You know, that panda
makes a lot of good points.

734
00:43:03,058 --> 00:43:06,687
- I like it.
- Violence, violence, violence.

735
00:43:06,687 --> 00:43:07,897
No, no, no! Wait!

736
00:43:07,897 --> 00:43:08,981
Come back!

737
00:43:08,981 --> 00:43:10,941
I'll come up with better wisdom.

738
00:43:11,734 --> 00:43:13,903
You have got to workshop
those proverbs.

739
00:43:15,613 --> 00:43:17,948
- Uh, the Kung Fu Panda?
- Nope.

740
00:43:17,948 --> 00:43:19,783
The son of Mr. Ping and Li?

741
00:43:19,783 --> 00:43:21,702
Those are both very common names.

742
00:43:21,702 --> 00:43:23,495
- Mentored by Oogway?
- Sorry.

743
00:43:23,495 --> 00:43:25,164
Trained by Master Shifu?

744
00:43:25,164 --> 00:43:27,374
- Oh! Master Shifu? Yes.
- Aha!

745
00:43:27,374 --> 00:43:29,835
Everyone's heard of
the legendary Master Shifu.

746
00:43:29,835 --> 00:43:30,878
But not you.

747
00:43:31,879 --> 00:43:34,340
Did someone say "legendary"?
Bring it in.

748
00:43:36,717 --> 00:43:37,718
Look, Han.

749
00:43:37,718 --> 00:43:40,721
I know we've had our differences,
but I'm really in a jam here,

750
00:43:40,721 --> 00:43:42,431
and I was hoping
you could help me out.

751
00:43:42,431 --> 00:43:44,266
- Thank you.
- Don't drink that.

752
00:43:46,227 --> 00:43:49,730
Oh!

753
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:52,858
We just need someplace to lie low
for a while until the heat cools off.

754
00:43:52,858 --> 00:43:54,401
And why should I help you?

755
00:43:54,401 --> 00:43:57,071
Because deep down
beneath that iron-scaled exterior

756
00:43:57,071 --> 00:43:58,572
is a good-hearted soul

757
00:43:58,572 --> 00:44:00,491
who still thinks of me
as one of the family?

758
00:44:01,534 --> 00:44:02,660
Fine.

759
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:06,205
But if you're still here by nightfall,
I'm calling the bulls myself.

760
00:44:06,914 --> 00:44:07,873
Sleep tight.

761
00:44:12,294 --> 00:44:14,213
So tonight, we take down The Chameleon.

762
00:44:14,213 --> 00:44:15,798
After you get your pants back.

763
00:44:16,674 --> 00:44:18,384
Not cool! You guys...

764
00:44:18,384 --> 00:44:20,010
Come on! Give them back.

765
00:44:20,010 --> 00:44:21,428
Those are custom.

766
00:44:27,768 --> 00:44:31,146
Yeah, this place doesn't
look very friendly.

767
00:44:31,981 --> 00:44:34,358
Oh! Oh, my tail.

768
00:44:35,276 --> 00:44:37,528
I'm sure everything is fine.

769
00:44:37,528 --> 00:44:38,988
This is a restaurant.

770
00:44:38,988 --> 00:44:41,991
These are my people.
We speak the same language.

771
00:44:41,991 --> 00:44:43,242
You wait here.

772
00:44:45,369 --> 00:44:47,121
Salutations!

773
00:44:47,121 --> 00:44:49,707
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

774
00:44:49,707 --> 00:44:51,166
I know you're having a good time,

775
00:44:51,166 --> 00:44:55,838
but I was wondering if a panda
happened to be passing by these parts?

776
00:44:56,422 --> 00:44:57,882
There was a panda here.

777
00:44:58,549 --> 00:44:59,633
You know him?

778
00:44:59,633 --> 00:45:02,428
Know him? Why, I'm his dad!

779
00:45:05,097 --> 00:45:06,724
No, no, no, no, no, no. Hmm?

780
00:45:07,349 --> 00:45:10,936
You need to pay
for what your son did to my tavern.

781
00:45:15,107 --> 00:45:18,235
My boy wouldn't have done this
for no reason.

782
00:45:18,235 --> 00:45:20,196
Is it possible your broth was bland?

783
00:45:20,196 --> 00:45:21,572
Try it.

784
00:45:22,072 --> 00:45:24,325
No, no!

785
00:45:24,325 --> 00:45:26,327
The broth smells excellent.

786
00:45:26,327 --> 00:45:30,080
You should not add a single thing,
especially not me!

787
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,624
Hands off the goose.

788
00:45:35,294 --> 00:45:36,629
The panda's back.

789
00:45:36,629 --> 00:45:38,088
- He's back?
- He's back?

790
00:45:38,088 --> 00:45:39,173
No.

791
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,927
But you're about to wish he was,

792
00:45:42,927 --> 00:45:45,387
'cause if you think he made a mess
of this place,

793
00:45:45,387 --> 00:45:48,349
you have no idea what I'm capable of.

794
00:45:48,349 --> 00:45:51,310
Everything he learned, he learned from me.

795
00:45:53,812 --> 00:45:55,523
Except one thing.

796
00:45:56,106 --> 00:45:57,066
Mercy.

797
00:45:58,275 --> 00:46:01,779
I don't know where he got that,
because I don't believe in it.

798
00:46:03,113 --> 00:46:06,617
Now, this can go one of two ways.

799
00:46:06,617 --> 00:46:10,996
The easy way,
in which you tell me where he is,

800
00:46:10,996 --> 00:46:12,081
or the hard way,

801
00:46:12,081 --> 00:46:14,833
in which you tell me where he is,

802
00:46:14,833 --> 00:46:16,794
but it's hard to understand
what you're saying

803
00:46:16,794 --> 00:46:18,170
because you have no teeth.

804
00:46:25,427 --> 00:46:26,845
Mah-jongg.

805
00:46:26,845 --> 00:46:29,932
I eat mah-jongg tiles for breakfast!

806
00:46:57,459 --> 00:46:58,669
Huh?

807
00:47:10,764 --> 00:47:11,765
Stay there!

808
00:47:11,765 --> 00:47:12,808
Where's our son?

809
00:47:12,808 --> 00:47:14,685
He took a boat to Juniper City.

810
00:47:14,685 --> 00:47:15,853
Which way?

811
00:47:17,062 --> 00:47:19,106
You know, a wise goose once...

812
00:47:19,106 --> 00:47:20,399
Time to go.

813
00:47:20,399 --> 00:47:21,734
Uh, yeah. Right.

814
00:47:52,348 --> 00:47:54,099
Okay, let's try this again.

815
00:47:54,099 --> 00:47:58,854
Stir the pot, roll the wok,
serve the dish, and ska-blam!

816
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:02,691
Hey, where's the golden dragon
that's supposed to shoot out?

817
00:48:02,691 --> 00:48:04,527
Not gonna happen with a broom.

818
00:48:04,527 --> 00:48:05,694
Yeah? Still not bad though.

819
00:48:05,694 --> 00:48:11,033
Yeah. But stir later, roll higher,
and the word is "skadoosh."

820
00:48:11,033 --> 00:48:12,493
"Skadoosh" isn't a word.

821
00:48:12,493 --> 00:48:14,662
- And "ska-blam" is?

822
00:48:19,542 --> 00:48:20,626
Ska-blam!

823
00:48:26,173 --> 00:48:29,760
I gotta say, you're not
like any of the other masters I've met.

824
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,887
Yeah, I know.
There's not a lot of pandas.

825
00:48:31,887 --> 00:48:34,807
No, you're, like, a good guy.

826
00:48:34,807 --> 00:48:37,226
Listen up. The coast is clear.

827
00:48:37,226 --> 00:48:39,687
Thieves, hit the streets.

828
00:48:39,687 --> 00:48:41,021
And you two,

829
00:48:41,021 --> 00:48:42,690
get out of my sight.

830
00:48:54,326 --> 00:48:55,494
Huh?

831
00:49:03,377 --> 00:49:06,297
I know I promised that I'd lead you
right to The Chameleon's front door,

832
00:49:06,297 --> 00:49:09,049
but the back door seems
a little more practical.

833
00:49:09,049 --> 00:49:13,387
I gotta say, Zhen,
you really are a fox of your word.

834
00:49:13,387 --> 00:49:15,514
A chewed-up peach pit?

835
00:49:15,514 --> 00:49:18,475
One from Master Oogway's peach tree
of heavenly wisdom.

836
00:49:19,602 --> 00:49:21,854
Eh, it's a Valley of Peace thing.

837
00:49:21,854 --> 00:49:26,108
It's supposed to remind me that every pit
holds the promise of a mighty tree.

838
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:30,112
Maybe it'll do the same for you.

839
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:37,703
Are you sure you wanna do this?

840
00:49:37,703 --> 00:49:40,581
As a wise Spiritual Leader once said,

841
00:49:40,581 --> 00:49:45,628
how may one kick butt,
if one doesn't seek a butt to kick?

842
00:49:48,005 --> 00:49:49,882
You're a real piece of work,
you know that?

843
00:49:49,882 --> 00:49:51,133
Thank you.

844
00:49:51,133 --> 00:49:53,761
Wait, was that a compliment or an insult?

845
00:49:53,761 --> 00:49:54,887
Yes.

846
00:50:03,521 --> 00:50:04,480
Whoa.

847
00:50:07,525 --> 00:50:09,068
Have you seen our son?

848
00:50:16,075 --> 00:50:17,201
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

849
00:50:17,201 --> 00:50:18,494
- Nope.
- Nah.

850
00:50:18,494 --> 00:50:20,454
Tell us you've seen our son.

851
00:50:23,082 --> 00:50:25,376
Wait, why are they leaving? You said yes.

852
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:29,004
Hey, look. Po was here.

853
00:50:29,004 --> 00:50:31,465
Amazing, Li, but how can you tell?

854
00:50:31,465 --> 00:50:34,510
Oh, we pandas have a gift
for seeing what others cannot.

855
00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:36,929
Come on. There may be more clues up ahead.

856
00:51:11,755 --> 00:51:13,340
Why?

857
00:52:06,352 --> 00:52:07,686
That was close.

858
00:52:07,686 --> 00:52:09,063
Look out!

859
00:52:09,063 --> 00:52:10,314
Huh?

860
00:52:12,358 --> 00:52:14,193
- Po!
- Stand back.

861
00:52:16,779 --> 00:52:18,322
- Whoa!

862
00:52:19,865 --> 00:52:22,284
- They're coming!
- Hurry! Help me lift the cage!

863
00:52:29,041 --> 00:52:30,125
It's no use.

864
00:52:30,125 --> 00:52:33,045
- We gotta brace it with something.
- Here, use my staff.

865
00:52:33,045 --> 00:52:35,214
All right, stand back. Here I go.

866
00:52:37,341 --> 00:52:38,384
Zhen?

867
00:52:40,427 --> 00:52:42,179
Where are you taking my staff?

868
00:52:44,056 --> 00:52:46,892
I think you mean my staff?

869
00:52:46,892 --> 00:52:50,729
You gave it to Zhen,
and now Zhen has given it to me.

870
00:52:50,729 --> 00:52:53,941
"Given to gain,"
I believe, is how it works?

871
00:52:53,941 --> 00:52:55,568
You were right, Zhen.

872
00:52:55,568 --> 00:52:56,986
He was an easy mark.

873
00:52:56,986 --> 00:52:58,362
Zhen...

874
00:52:58,362 --> 00:53:01,532
First rule of the streets:
Never trust anyone.

875
00:53:01,532 --> 00:53:03,534
I taught her that.

876
00:53:03,534 --> 00:53:06,245
And you thought my apprentice
was your friend?

877
00:53:06,245 --> 00:53:07,496
Apprentice?

878
00:53:07,496 --> 00:53:09,415
She's the one that took you in?

879
00:53:09,415 --> 00:53:11,834
Best thing that ever happened to her.

880
00:53:11,834 --> 00:53:15,212
You should have seen
the little guttersnipe before I found her.

881
00:53:15,212 --> 00:53:17,298
<i>Mangy and half-starved,</i>

882
00:53:18,716 --> 00:53:21,802
<i>hanging out with those rejects
from the Den of Thieves.</i>

883
00:53:43,282 --> 00:53:44,950
<i>She had no fear.</i>

884
00:53:46,285 --> 00:53:47,745
<i>Such potential.</i>

885
00:53:54,418 --> 00:53:56,045
So I took her in.

886
00:53:57,630 --> 00:53:59,924
I made her what she is today.

887
00:53:59,924 --> 00:54:01,508
Stand up straight.

888
00:54:01,508 --> 00:54:02,676
Yes, master.

889
00:54:02,676 --> 00:54:06,347
So you went through all of this just to
get me to give you the Staff of Wisdom?

890
00:54:06,347 --> 00:54:07,431
Why?

891
00:54:07,431 --> 00:54:13,312
I, too, came from humble beginnings
and dreamed of becoming something more.

892
00:54:13,854 --> 00:54:15,356
I wanted respect and power.

893
00:54:15,356 --> 00:54:18,108
I wanted to be a master of kung fu.

894
00:54:18,108 --> 00:54:19,193
Say what?

895
00:54:19,193 --> 00:54:22,780
I was turned away
from every training hall I went to.

896
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:26,867
They would say I was too small, too lowly,

897
00:54:26,867 --> 00:54:30,079
and that kung fu was not my destiny.

898
00:54:30,079 --> 00:54:33,332
And so, I chose a different path.

899
00:54:33,332 --> 00:54:35,084
Sorcery.

900
00:54:35,084 --> 00:54:36,335
I grew.

901
00:54:37,294 --> 00:54:38,629
I excelled.

902
00:54:38,629 --> 00:54:42,466
And I got everything
I had ever dreamed of.

903
00:54:42,466 --> 00:54:45,427
- Everything except kung fu.

904
00:54:45,427 --> 00:54:49,640
Just because I can look like Tai Lung
doesn't mean I can fight like him.

905
00:54:50,766 --> 00:54:54,895
You see, Po, kung fu may be
performed by the body,

906
00:54:54,895 --> 00:54:57,982
but its secrets are housed in the spirit.

907
00:54:57,982 --> 00:55:00,609
And now that I have access
to the Spirit Realm...

908
00:55:00,609 --> 00:55:02,820
You're gonna steal Tai Lung's kung fu.

909
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:06,407
His and those of every master villain
that came before me.

910
00:55:06,407 --> 00:55:11,328
And once I do, no one will dare
underestimate me again.

911
00:55:11,328 --> 00:55:13,372
You forgot about me.

912
00:55:16,125 --> 00:55:18,168
Don't bother, Po.

913
00:55:18,168 --> 00:55:23,340
Those bars are enchanted with
some very old and very powerful magic.

914
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:27,303
You'd need at least ten Dragon Warriors
to get through them.

915
00:55:27,303 --> 00:55:28,846
Then I won't go through them.

916
00:55:28,846 --> 00:55:30,973
I'll go under them.

917
00:55:45,487 --> 00:55:47,907
Well, that's frustrating
for all sorts of reasons.

918
00:55:56,332 --> 00:55:57,666
Whoa!

919
00:56:25,236 --> 00:56:27,196
- Po!
- Zhen?

920
00:56:27,947 --> 00:56:29,323
My staff! Hand it over.

921
00:56:29,323 --> 00:56:32,326
I'm so sorry I lied to you.
I was just doing what I was told.

922
00:56:32,326 --> 00:56:34,662
Apologize later.
Right now, I have to stop The Chameleon.

923
00:56:34,662 --> 00:56:36,413
Po!

924
00:56:36,413 --> 00:56:37,748
Zhen?

925
00:56:42,878 --> 00:56:44,380
No!

926
00:56:50,469 --> 00:56:52,221
Well done, Zhen.

927
00:56:52,221 --> 00:56:54,431
You never said you were gonna hurt him.

928
00:56:54,431 --> 00:56:56,642
What's the second rule
of the streets?

929
00:56:57,601 --> 00:56:59,228
Someone always gets hurt.

930
00:56:59,228 --> 00:57:01,313
And make sure it's never you.

931
00:57:02,147 --> 00:57:05,109
I just wish there had been another way.

932
00:57:05,109 --> 00:57:06,819
Third rule of the streets?

933
00:57:07,319 --> 00:57:08,571
Third rule?

934
00:57:08,571 --> 00:57:11,198
Some would say
it's the most important:

935
00:57:11,198 --> 00:57:14,827
No one is interested in your feelings.

936
00:57:16,579 --> 00:57:19,081
Chop-chop!
We have a Spirit Realm to plunder.

937
00:57:20,165 --> 00:57:22,001
And smile.

938
00:57:22,001 --> 00:57:24,211
Nobody likes a grouch.

939
00:57:24,211 --> 00:57:27,840
Honestly, Zhen, I don't know where
you pick up such bad habits.

940
00:57:35,556 --> 00:57:36,557
If I could...

941
00:57:40,436 --> 00:57:41,395
Hey there.

942
00:57:42,188 --> 00:57:43,731
Whoa!

943
00:57:45,316 --> 00:57:47,776
Get off me! Ow! Ow!

944
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:54,366
Son!

945
00:58:02,166 --> 00:58:04,585
- Now save me.

946
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:06,921
Hi, Son.

947
00:58:10,716 --> 00:58:13,344
It's okay. We've got you, Po.
We've got you.

948
00:58:15,721 --> 00:58:17,097
So you followed me.

949
00:58:17,097 --> 00:58:18,474
- It was his idea.

950
00:58:18,474 --> 00:58:20,434
Okay, okay. It was both our ideas.

951
00:58:20,434 --> 00:58:22,603
We only follow because we love.

952
00:58:22,603 --> 00:58:25,564
No, you followed
because you didn't believe in me.

953
00:58:26,774 --> 00:58:27,900
And because we love?

954
00:58:29,068 --> 00:58:31,070
Well, you're right.

955
00:58:31,695 --> 00:58:33,531
I screwed up big-time.

956
00:58:34,406 --> 00:58:36,242
I trusted the wrong person.

957
00:58:36,242 --> 00:58:38,827
I gave the Staff of Wisdom
right to The Chameleon.

958
00:58:40,496 --> 00:58:41,497
Oh...

959
00:58:42,206 --> 00:58:46,835
Po, that was a very big-time screw-up.

960
00:58:49,672 --> 00:58:53,217
If only I'd listened to Master Shifu
and stayed in the Valley of Peace,

961
00:58:53,217 --> 00:58:56,804
The Chameleon wouldn't have my staff,
and none of this would be happening.

962
00:58:56,804 --> 00:58:59,765
I was just so determined
to keep things the way they were.

963
00:58:59,765 --> 00:59:02,935
Everyone is afraid of change, Po.

964
00:59:02,935 --> 00:59:04,562
Even me.

965
00:59:04,562 --> 00:59:07,439
There was a time not so long ago

966
00:59:07,439 --> 00:59:12,361
when all I wanted to be was
the greatest noodle chef in the valley.

967
00:59:12,361 --> 00:59:13,821
So what happened?

968
00:59:14,405 --> 00:59:16,907
I became the greatest noodle chef
in the valley.

969
00:59:16,907 --> 00:59:18,033
It's true.

970
00:59:18,033 --> 00:59:20,077
But I also became a father.

971
00:59:20,786 --> 00:59:23,914
And nothing...
nothing's ever been the same since.

972
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:27,376
Change doesn't always
have to be a bad thing.

973
00:59:27,376 --> 00:59:30,963
Why do you think I always change
the menu at the restaurant?

974
00:59:32,590 --> 00:59:35,134
Because if things stayed the same forever,

975
00:59:35,134 --> 00:59:38,012
sooner or later,
they would lose their flavor.

976
00:59:39,638 --> 00:59:40,764
He's right, Po.

977
00:59:40,764 --> 00:59:44,059
Since I left my village,
I've become a bit of a warrior.

978
00:59:44,059 --> 00:59:45,978
- Strong. Brave.

979
00:59:47,396 --> 00:59:49,231
Move it.

980
00:59:49,231 --> 00:59:50,316
This way.

981
00:59:50,983 --> 00:59:53,652
Get those cages up there. Come on.

982
00:59:54,486 --> 00:59:56,572
Hmm. This looks bad.

983
00:59:56,572 --> 00:59:57,698
Really bad.

984
00:59:57,698 --> 00:59:58,782
Move it.

985
00:59:58,782 --> 01:00:00,701
Come on.

986
01:00:05,998 --> 01:00:10,169
Don't tell me you were actually starting
to become friends with that panda.

987
01:00:10,169 --> 01:00:12,796
What? No. It's-It's just...

988
01:00:12,796 --> 01:00:16,550
When we want something, we must use
whatever is at our disposal to get it.

989
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:19,803
That's all that panda was,
something to use.

990
01:00:21,472 --> 01:00:26,185
Is that why you took me in?
So I could help you get what you wanted?

991
01:00:26,185 --> 01:00:27,603
Zhen.

992
01:00:27,603 --> 01:00:32,066
I took you in because you were clever
and ruthless and unsentimental,

993
01:00:32,066 --> 01:00:33,150
like me.

994
01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:35,528
And the day you stop being those things

995
01:00:35,528 --> 01:00:39,907
is the day when, yes,
you stop being useful to me.

996
01:00:39,907 --> 01:00:43,494
So for both of our sakes,
don't change.

997
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:55,631
Tonight, when the blood moon rises
to its highest point in the night sky,

998
01:00:55,631 --> 01:01:01,554
I will open the door to the Spirit Realm,
and all of its secrets will be mine!

999
01:01:07,768 --> 01:01:10,062
Does the blood moon
always rise this slowly?

1000
01:01:12,147 --> 01:01:14,567
I seem to remember it rising faster.

1001
01:01:16,277 --> 01:01:17,570
No?

1002
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:18,654
Just me?

1003
01:01:19,822 --> 01:01:20,823
Hmm.

1004
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:24,118
Ugh.

1005
01:01:24,118 --> 01:01:26,287
It's just for dramatic effect anyway.

1006
01:01:26,287 --> 01:01:29,248
I think I'm just gonna
open the Spirit Realm now.

1007
01:01:41,218 --> 01:01:42,887
Bring me Tai Lung!

1008
01:01:53,147 --> 01:01:54,148
Tai Lung.

1009
01:01:55,232 --> 01:01:56,233
Big fan.

1010
01:01:56,233 --> 01:01:59,111
Who are you,
and what are you doing with that staff?

1011
01:01:59,111 --> 01:02:02,239
This was given to me
by an old friend of yours.

1012
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:03,741
The puffy panda?

1013
01:02:03,741 --> 01:02:05,201
Po might be an idiot,

1014
01:02:05,201 --> 01:02:09,163
but he'd never willingly hand over
Oogway's staff to the likes of you.

1015
01:02:09,163 --> 01:02:11,540
Who said anything about willingly?

1016
01:02:20,424 --> 01:02:24,803
Hmm. Apparently I misjudged you, lizard.

1017
01:02:24,803 --> 01:02:27,306
Now, why have you brought me back?

1018
01:02:27,306 --> 01:02:29,475
I summoned you here
so that you could teach me

1019
01:02:29,475 --> 01:02:31,560
your most legendary kung fu moves.

1020
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:34,688
I don't share my skills with anyone.

1021
01:02:34,688 --> 01:02:36,398
It wasn't a request.

1022
01:03:27,449 --> 01:03:29,451
Yes, I got it!

1023
01:03:29,451 --> 01:03:31,537
The Tai Lung nerve strike.

1024
01:03:31,537 --> 01:03:33,706
The power, the precision.

1025
01:03:37,376 --> 01:03:39,587
What have you done to me?

1026
01:03:39,587 --> 01:03:43,173
All of your kung fu is now mine.

1027
01:03:44,091 --> 01:03:48,554
And the best part is,
I'm just getting warmed up.

1028
01:03:48,554 --> 01:03:50,931
Bring me General Kai.

1029
01:03:53,517 --> 01:03:57,271
Bring me Master Osprey.

1030
01:03:59,315 --> 01:04:01,525
Master Bull.

1031
01:04:08,199 --> 01:04:09,283
Po, wait!

1032
01:04:09,283 --> 01:04:11,577
Please be reasonable.

1033
01:04:11,577 --> 01:04:13,787
I'm not going anywhere
until I get my staff back.

1034
01:04:13,787 --> 01:04:15,873
No staff is worth your life.

1035
01:04:15,873 --> 01:04:18,292
As long as I'm still the Dragon Warrior,

1036
01:04:18,292 --> 01:04:20,920
I won't let anyone else get hurt
because of me.

1037
01:04:37,853 --> 01:04:38,812
Po!

1038
01:04:39,772 --> 01:04:40,898
You're alive!

1039
01:04:43,859 --> 01:04:46,028
Please. I made a mistake.

1040
01:04:46,028 --> 01:04:48,906
So did I. Trusting you.

1041
01:04:49,490 --> 01:04:50,449
I'm sorry.

1042
01:04:51,033 --> 01:04:52,868
Did your master tell you
to say that too?

1043
01:04:52,868 --> 01:04:56,080
She's not my master.
I'm leaving, for good.

1044
01:04:56,914 --> 01:04:58,207
It's the truth.

1045
01:04:58,207 --> 01:05:00,292
I was wrong about everything.

1046
01:05:01,585 --> 01:05:04,004
- What are you doing?

1047
01:05:04,004 --> 01:05:05,631
Stopping you.

1048
01:05:05,631 --> 01:05:07,508
Get out of my way, Zhen.

1049
01:05:07,508 --> 01:05:08,759
No.

1050
01:05:09,552 --> 01:05:10,469
Move.

1051
01:05:10,469 --> 01:05:12,221
You want me to move?

1052
01:05:12,221 --> 01:05:13,514
Move me.

1053
01:05:13,514 --> 01:05:16,100
First you betray me,
and now you wanna fight me?

1054
01:05:17,226 --> 01:05:18,686
- Why are you doing this?

1055
01:05:18,686 --> 01:05:21,689
To stop you from getting killed.

1056
01:05:49,717 --> 01:05:51,886
What do you care
if I get killed or not?

1057
01:06:07,735 --> 01:06:09,361
Please, Po.

1058
01:06:09,361 --> 01:06:11,572
Just let me do one thing right.

1059
01:06:16,744 --> 01:06:19,580
You're not the only one
who's made some bad choices lately.

1060
01:06:21,582 --> 01:06:23,709
You're really gonna
go through with this, aren't you?

1061
01:06:23,709 --> 01:06:24,835
'Fraid so.

1062
01:06:24,835 --> 01:06:27,755
And there's nothing I can do
to talk you out of it?

1063
01:06:27,755 --> 01:06:28,923
I'm afraid not.

1064
01:06:28,923 --> 01:06:30,925
You can't beat her, you know.

1065
01:06:30,925 --> 01:06:32,509
You're probably right.

1066
01:06:33,969 --> 01:06:35,387
But I have to try.

1067
01:06:37,014 --> 01:06:38,974
Get as far away from this place
as you can.

1068
01:06:38,974 --> 01:06:40,059
Po!

1069
01:06:40,059 --> 01:06:42,269
We should never have
let him come here.

1070
01:06:42,269 --> 01:06:44,522
We are such terrible fathers.

1071
01:06:44,522 --> 01:06:46,440
At least you didn't lie and betray him.

1072
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:48,859
Well, that's true. You're worse.

1073
01:06:48,859 --> 01:06:50,778
I am a terrible friend.

1074
01:06:50,778 --> 01:06:53,489
"Friend"?
That feels a little generous, no?

1075
01:06:53,489 --> 01:06:55,699
Uh, l-let's just give up.
Surrender.

1076
01:06:55,699 --> 01:06:57,368
We can't let him go in there alone.

1077
01:06:57,368 --> 01:06:58,953
What can we do?

1078
01:06:58,953 --> 01:07:01,413
There are just three of us
against an army.

1079
01:07:01,413 --> 01:07:04,208
Then I guess we'll just have to
get an army of our own.

1080
01:07:17,221 --> 01:07:19,098
Hey! Listen up, everybody!

1081
01:07:22,893 --> 01:07:25,521
Quack!

1082
01:07:27,898 --> 01:07:29,149
Thank you.

1083
01:07:29,149 --> 01:07:31,235
The Dragon Warrior's in trouble.

1084
01:07:32,152 --> 01:07:34,238
- Who?
- You know, Po.

1085
01:07:35,698 --> 01:07:36,866
The panda.

1086
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:41,996
No, no. A different panda.

1087
01:07:41,996 --> 01:07:44,206
- I'm his father.
- I'm also his father.

1088
01:07:44,957 --> 01:07:46,125
Okay, that doesn't matter.

1089
01:07:46,125 --> 01:07:49,795
What matters is that my friend's
in trouble and he needs my help.

1090
01:07:49,795 --> 01:07:51,755
So, I need yours.

1091
01:07:51,755 --> 01:07:53,591
Why should we help you?

1092
01:07:53,591 --> 01:07:54,925
Because...

1093
01:07:54,925 --> 01:07:56,010
Because...

1094
01:07:56,886 --> 01:07:58,429
it's the right thing to do.

1095
01:08:02,766 --> 01:08:04,727
Stop it. Stop.

1096
01:08:04,727 --> 01:08:06,061
Stop laughing.

1097
01:08:07,354 --> 01:08:09,690
Look, I know you think
it might be too late

1098
01:08:09,690 --> 01:08:14,445
for a bunch of cheats, thieves and
cutthroats like us to change our ways,

1099
01:08:14,445 --> 01:08:19,532
but a good friend once told me
it's never too late to do the right thing.

1100
01:08:19,532 --> 01:08:23,077
So what you're saying is,
the more right we do now,

1101
01:08:23,077 --> 01:08:25,121
the more wrong we can do later.

1102
01:08:25,121 --> 01:08:26,331
- What? No.

1103
01:08:26,331 --> 01:08:28,876
And with The Chameleon out of the way...

1104
01:08:28,876 --> 01:08:31,086
We can finally do all the wrong we want.

1105
01:08:31,086 --> 01:08:33,130
I-I think you're missing
the fundamental point.

1106
01:08:33,130 --> 01:08:35,758
Violence, violence, violence.

1107
01:08:35,758 --> 01:08:39,595
Are you guys ready to do the right thing
for the wrong reasons?

1108
01:08:44,642 --> 01:08:47,186
Now, you see, this mistake
this Dragon Warrior fellow made

1109
01:08:47,186 --> 01:08:48,979
was underestimating his opponent.

1110
01:08:48,979 --> 01:08:51,941
I never would have walked
into such an obvious trap.

1111
01:08:51,941 --> 01:08:53,442
Hey.

1112
01:08:56,028 --> 01:08:58,697
Now, you see, the mistake
this Dragon Warrior fellow made was that...

1113
01:08:58,697 --> 01:09:00,366
Shut up, Larry.

1114
01:09:05,037 --> 01:09:07,414
This place is crawling
with more guards than I've ever seen.

1115
01:09:07,414 --> 01:09:09,500
I'm never gonna get to Po in time.

1116
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:12,294
You just get to Po.
We'll take care of the guards.

1117
01:09:12,294 --> 01:09:13,671
We will?

1118
01:09:13,671 --> 01:09:15,171
I-I mean, we will.

1119
01:09:15,171 --> 01:09:16,382
But how?

1120
01:09:16,882 --> 01:09:18,550
Just leave that to me.

1121
01:09:49,790 --> 01:09:51,250
General Kai?

1122
01:09:52,001 --> 01:09:53,251
Lord Shen?

1123
01:09:53,251 --> 01:09:57,214
Those are all my old nemesis-es.
Nemes-ee. Nemes-i?

1124
01:09:57,214 --> 01:10:00,259
The Chameleon is pulling spirits
from the Spirit Realm

1125
01:10:00,259 --> 01:10:02,303
and draining us of all our moves.

1126
01:10:02,303 --> 01:10:05,139
And she's using your staff to do it.

1127
01:10:05,139 --> 01:10:07,141
- I'm here to get it back.

1128
01:10:07,141 --> 01:10:08,642
I won't hold my breath.

1129
01:10:08,642 --> 01:10:10,186
Um, I'm sorry, do I know you?

1130
01:10:10,186 --> 01:10:11,979
Do you know me? It's Scott.

1131
01:10:13,772 --> 01:10:15,733
The fire-breathing crocodile?

1132
01:10:15,733 --> 01:10:18,819
Oh, right! Scott!

1133
01:10:18,819 --> 01:10:21,113
Master Shifu and I
were just talking about you.

1134
01:10:21,113 --> 01:10:22,573
Panda.

1135
01:10:23,199 --> 01:10:26,952
Oogway made a mistake
choosing you as the Dragon Warrior.

1136
01:10:28,078 --> 01:10:32,208
I just didn't realize
how big a mistake it was until now.

1137
01:10:32,208 --> 01:10:34,752
Whoa. Tai Lung?

1138
01:10:34,752 --> 01:10:38,297
I'm gonna get that staff back,
restore your kung fu,

1139
01:10:38,297 --> 01:10:40,758
and return you all
back to the Spirit Realm.

1140
01:10:40,758 --> 01:10:42,092
You'll see.

1141
01:10:42,092 --> 01:10:43,427
All I see

1142
01:10:44,261 --> 01:10:46,180
is a broken promise.

1143
01:10:51,310 --> 01:10:55,814
All right, you bunch of
cantankerous Komodos.

1144
01:10:55,814 --> 01:10:59,109
Now, this can go one of two ways.

1145
01:10:59,109 --> 01:11:02,905
The easy way,
in which you surrender willingly,

1146
01:11:02,905 --> 01:11:07,034
or the hard way,
where you surrender woundedly.

1147
01:11:07,034 --> 01:11:09,828
The choice is yours.

1148
01:11:13,165 --> 01:11:16,085
- I was kidding! I was kidding!

1149
01:11:25,010 --> 01:11:26,011
Aw.

1150
01:11:28,222 --> 01:11:29,765
- Ow! Ow!

1151
01:11:32,101 --> 01:11:33,102
Thanks, Ping.

1152
01:11:37,439 --> 01:11:38,566
Run away!

1153
01:11:42,820 --> 01:11:45,656
Cannonball!

1154
01:11:54,123 --> 01:11:55,332
- Oh, is it too spicy?

1155
01:11:55,332 --> 01:11:58,085
Mmm. No. It's got the perfect kick.

1156
01:11:58,085 --> 01:12:01,338
Ginseng. That's the secret
to my mulberry punch.

1157
01:12:08,304 --> 01:12:11,557
That panda was right.
More violence later is better!

1158
01:12:12,182 --> 01:12:13,517
Yay!

1159
01:12:19,481 --> 01:12:22,067
I believe you have something
that belongs to me.

1160
01:12:25,446 --> 01:12:27,615
Can't you even die right?

1161
01:12:27,615 --> 01:12:29,575
Can't you even kill wrong?

1162
01:12:29,575 --> 01:12:31,911
No.
Wordplay didn't come together.

1163
01:12:31,911 --> 01:12:33,245
Now, about that staff...

1164
01:12:35,623 --> 01:12:36,624
Take it.

1165
01:12:36,624 --> 01:12:39,293
I already have everything I need
from it anyway.

1166
01:12:39,877 --> 01:12:42,087
I think this was destiny.

1167
01:12:42,087 --> 01:12:46,592
A final face-off
between formidable adversaries,

1168
01:12:46,592 --> 01:12:49,428
alike in so many ways.

1169
01:12:49,428 --> 01:12:51,055
If only I had a dumpling for every time

1170
01:12:51,055 --> 01:12:52,973
a villain told me
how much we had in common.

1171
01:12:52,973 --> 01:12:54,058
It's true.

1172
01:12:54,058 --> 01:12:56,393
We've both risen
to the highest of heights.

1173
01:12:56,393 --> 01:12:59,522
It's a shame only one of us can
come out on top.

1174
01:12:59,522 --> 01:13:02,149
It is a shame, for you.

1175
01:13:02,149 --> 01:13:07,112
My combined powers of sorcery and kung fu
make me unstoppable.

1176
01:13:07,112 --> 01:13:11,575
And once I dispense with you,
I'll expand my rule from Juniper City to...

1177
01:13:11,575 --> 01:13:13,369
Every other city and town and village

1178
01:13:13,369 --> 01:13:15,120
from here to the Valley of Peace
and beyond.

1179
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:16,330
Yeah, I know.

1180
01:13:16,330 --> 01:13:18,415
But how did you know?

1181
01:13:18,415 --> 01:13:22,378
I saw it in a vision
because I'm the Dragon Warrior...

1182
01:13:24,547 --> 01:13:25,881
for now at least.

1183
01:13:25,881 --> 01:13:29,468
But I've realized
that it's probably time I made a change.

1184
01:13:30,553 --> 01:13:31,971
And so should you.

1185
01:13:31,971 --> 01:13:34,848
I'm The Chameleon.
I do nothing but change.

1186
01:13:34,848 --> 01:13:36,684
Only on the outside.

1187
01:13:36,684 --> 01:13:39,436
Real change happens from within.

1188
01:13:39,436 --> 01:13:41,897
And if we're really as alike as you say,

1189
01:13:41,897 --> 01:13:43,941
then maybe we could both let go
of who we were

1190
01:13:43,941 --> 01:13:46,360
and become something better
than we already are.

1191
01:13:47,152 --> 01:13:49,655
- What do you say?
- I say...

1192
01:13:52,241 --> 01:13:53,742
Well, I saw that coming.

1193
01:13:56,036 --> 01:13:57,746
We're very proud of you.

1194
01:13:57,746 --> 01:13:58,956
You tried it our way.

1195
01:13:58,956 --> 01:14:01,083
Now try it yours.

1196
01:14:01,083 --> 01:14:03,335
Kick her butt.

1197
01:14:03,335 --> 01:14:05,254
I'm way ahead of you.

1198
01:14:13,304 --> 01:14:15,472
Master Elephant's Trunk Twist.

1199
01:14:18,851 --> 01:14:20,769
Master Boar's Tusks of Terror.

1200
01:14:21,854 --> 01:14:23,856
Master Wolf's Fangs of Fury.

1201
01:14:28,903 --> 01:14:30,863
Master Bull's Horns of Doom.

1202
01:14:33,282 --> 01:14:34,491
What?

1203
01:14:34,491 --> 01:14:35,826
Recognize this move?

1204
01:14:38,454 --> 01:14:41,165
Is that how I sound?
I don't sound like that, do I?

1205
01:14:41,165 --> 01:14:44,418
You didn't earn those skills.
You just stole them!

1206
01:14:45,502 --> 01:14:47,087
Give him a left, a right, uppercut.

1207
01:14:47,087 --> 01:14:50,674
- Which one are you rooting for?
- I'm not sure. This is all very confusing.

1208
01:14:50,674 --> 01:14:53,427
I'm stronger than every opponent
you've ever faced,

1209
01:14:53,427 --> 01:14:56,847
because I am every opponent
you've ever faced.

1210
01:14:56,847 --> 01:14:57,765
Po!

1211
01:15:10,402 --> 01:15:13,197
Whoa. I gotta workshop
those heroic entrances.

1212
01:15:13,197 --> 01:15:15,491
Nah, it was just right.

1213
01:15:17,326 --> 01:15:20,663
I knew I should have left you
to rot in the gutter where you belong.

1214
01:15:20,663 --> 01:15:23,290
Better to rot in the gutter
than under your thumb.

1215
01:15:31,382 --> 01:15:33,300
- Two against one?

1216
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:35,511
Well, now, that doesn't seem fair.

1217
01:15:35,511 --> 01:15:37,680
I'll have to even the odds.

1218
01:15:38,889 --> 01:15:40,558
Master Cobra.

1219
01:15:41,225 --> 01:15:43,310
Master Osprey.

1220
01:15:43,310 --> 01:15:45,354
Master Scorpion.

1221
01:15:45,354 --> 01:15:47,398
Master Wolf.

1222
01:15:47,398 --> 01:15:49,859
General Kai.

1223
01:15:49,859 --> 01:15:51,151
Lord Shen.

1224
01:15:55,364 --> 01:15:58,409
That is awesome!

1225
01:15:59,535 --> 01:16:01,537
I mean, it's disturbing, but it's awesome.

1226
01:16:18,929 --> 01:16:19,763
Whoa!

1227
01:16:20,681 --> 01:16:22,182
Zhen!

1228
01:16:34,570 --> 01:16:36,614
No!

1229
01:16:43,037 --> 01:16:44,288
Whoa, whoa!

1230
01:16:56,842 --> 01:16:58,093
Po!

1231
01:17:04,934 --> 01:17:06,602
I thought we were friends.

1232
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:09,563
Stand back.

1233
01:17:09,563 --> 01:17:11,899
I'm gonna kick my butt.

1234
01:18:34,648 --> 01:18:35,941
Come on, Po, get out of there.

1235
01:18:35,941 --> 01:18:38,402
- You have to do this.
- I can't beat The Chameleon.

1236
01:18:38,402 --> 01:18:40,029
A wise, old tortoise once told me

1237
01:18:40,029 --> 01:18:42,281
that you never know what you can do
until you do it.

1238
01:18:42,281 --> 01:18:44,450
The fate of the world
hangs in the balance,

1239
01:18:44,450 --> 01:18:47,036
and you're here giving me life advice
from a tortoise?

1240
01:18:47,036 --> 01:18:48,621
Be the pit, Zhen.

1241
01:18:49,246 --> 01:18:50,956
Be the pit.

1242
01:19:00,716 --> 01:19:02,384
And what do you think you're doing?

1243
01:19:02,384 --> 01:19:04,136
Finishing what Po started.

1244
01:19:04,136 --> 01:19:07,014
Oh, please. How many times
do I have to tell you?

1245
01:19:09,016 --> 01:19:10,434
Don't slouch.

1246
01:19:20,444 --> 01:19:22,738
You ungrateful little urchin.

1247
01:19:22,738 --> 01:19:26,909
After all I've done for you,
you betrayed me for the panda?

1248
01:19:27,910 --> 01:19:31,664
First rule
of the streets: Never trust anyone.

1249
01:19:31,664 --> 01:19:35,084
Ha! You can't defeat me.
I know all your moves.

1250
01:19:35,084 --> 01:19:36,669
Not this one.

1251
01:19:36,669 --> 01:19:40,297
Roll, stir, serve,

1252
01:19:40,297 --> 01:19:42,424
and ska-blam!

1253
01:19:47,137 --> 01:19:50,015
Yes!

1254
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:53,310
Second rule: Someone always gets hurt.

1255
01:19:53,936 --> 01:19:55,563
Now, that's a cool move.

1256
01:19:55,563 --> 01:19:58,399
Po! You could have gotten out of that cage
anytime you wanted?

1257
01:19:58,399 --> 01:19:59,567
You faker.

1258
01:19:59,567 --> 01:20:01,652
It's not faking. It's Method.

1259
01:20:01,652 --> 01:20:04,864
Besides, how's a peach pit
ever supposed to become a tree

1260
01:20:04,864 --> 01:20:07,658
if you never give it
the chance to grow?

1261
01:20:09,910 --> 01:20:12,746
And, hey, you stirred faster
and rolled higher.

1262
01:20:12,746 --> 01:20:15,749
But for the last time, the word is...

1263
01:20:22,882 --> 01:20:24,008
..."skadoosh."

1264
01:20:49,783 --> 01:20:52,494
Maybe Oogway was right about you.

1265
01:20:55,247 --> 01:20:57,583
You aren't completely useless after all.

1266
01:20:58,459 --> 01:21:00,002
Oh, my gosh. Thank you so much.

1267
01:21:10,429 --> 01:21:12,890
That's my son.

1268
01:21:12,890 --> 01:21:14,058
Our son.

1269
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:19,271
I think it's time you send us home, panda.

1270
01:21:53,681 --> 01:21:56,058
Zhen, do something!

1271
01:21:56,058 --> 01:21:59,854
Third rule:
No one's interested in your feelings.

1272
01:22:04,942 --> 01:22:08,946
See you on the other side, Dragon Warrior.

1273
01:22:31,427 --> 01:22:33,596
We packed some food
for your time in jail.

1274
01:22:33,596 --> 01:22:36,390
Let's hope it's not
your final meal.

1275
01:22:36,390 --> 01:22:37,933
Thanks, guys.

1276
01:22:38,809 --> 01:22:43,522
I was thinking, after I serve my time
and I'm a free fox again,

1277
01:22:43,522 --> 01:22:46,358
maybe I'll open one of those
acupuncture places that are all the rage.

1278
01:22:46,358 --> 01:22:51,197
I think you're better suited for a job
with a little more room for growth.

1279
01:22:55,034 --> 01:22:56,035
Jade Palace?

1280
01:22:57,870 --> 01:22:59,622
Her?

1281
01:22:59,622 --> 01:23:03,500
Out of all the candidates you choose
to train as your worthy successor,

1282
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:05,211
you chose the fox?

1283
01:23:05,211 --> 01:23:07,296
You know when you know,
you know?

1284
01:23:07,296 --> 01:23:09,924
Fine, choose who you want.
A thief, a stick, a carrot.

1285
01:23:09,924 --> 01:23:11,717
I don't even know why I bother.

1286
01:23:11,717 --> 01:23:14,553
I'm going to go meditate... a lot.

1287
01:23:17,014 --> 01:23:18,891
Don't worry. He'll come around.

1288
01:23:19,558 --> 01:23:21,560
Probably. Maybe.

1289
01:23:23,354 --> 01:23:24,939
Hey, you okay?

1290
01:23:26,899 --> 01:23:29,610
He's right.
What about me says I'm ready for this?

1291
01:23:30,819 --> 01:23:33,113
Well, as I learned
from working in my dad's kitchen,

1292
01:23:33,113 --> 01:23:37,701
sometimes the greatest dishes come
from the most unlikely ingredients.

1293
01:23:37,701 --> 01:23:39,787
Hey, that's not bad.

1294
01:23:39,787 --> 01:23:41,622
Okay, I see you, Spiritual Leader.

1295
01:23:41,622 --> 01:23:44,458
Yeah. I'm getting the hang of
this proverb thing.

1296
01:23:44,458 --> 01:23:47,586
One shouldn't do a deep squat
with a chopstick in one's pocket.

1297
01:23:47,586 --> 01:23:49,588
Maybe you should
just stick to kicking butt.

1298
01:23:49,588 --> 01:23:53,467
Money can't buy happiness,
but it sure can buy a lot of dumplings.

1299
01:23:53,467 --> 01:23:55,803
Why does it always come back
to dumplings with you?

1300
01:23:55,803 --> 01:24:00,558
When life gives you lemons,
make pear juice and blow everyone's minds.

1301
01:24:00,558 --> 01:24:01,642
We get it.

1302
01:24:01,642 --> 01:24:04,562
You can't have your mooncake
and eat it too.

1303
01:24:05,145 --> 01:24:08,399
Although, I guess you could have mooncake
and then order mango pudding on the side.

1304
01:24:08,399 --> 01:24:10,317
Can we just start the training now?

1305
01:24:12,903 --> 01:24:14,321
Inner peace.

1306
01:24:15,197 --> 01:24:16,657
Inner peace.

1307
01:24:17,449 --> 01:24:18,742
Inner peace.

1308
01:24:18,742 --> 01:24:19,827
Hey, Master Shifu.

1309
01:24:19,827 --> 01:24:20,911
Look, there's two of us.

1310
01:24:20,911 --> 01:24:23,038
- You're doing great, Shifu.
- You're not breathing with your belly.

1311
01:24:23,038 --> 01:24:24,874
- You look a little tired.
- Are you tired?

1312
01:24:26,625 --> 01:24:28,836
- You do look like a squirrel.
- Do you want a cookie?

1313
01:24:33,591 --> 01:24:35,259
Inner peace.

1314
01:24:36,677 --> 01:24:38,137
Inner peace.

1315
01:24:39,513 --> 01:24:41,307
Inner peace.

1316
01:24:49,773 --> 01:24:51,567
Are you ready to begin your training?

1317
01:24:52,151 --> 01:24:53,402
Are you?

1318
01:24:53,402 --> 01:24:55,988
Yes, and I brought a little help.
