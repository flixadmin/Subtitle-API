1
00:00:01,269 --> 00:00:02,599
My name is oliver queen.

2
00:00:03,229 --> 00:00:05,059
After five years in hell,

3
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:07,008
I have come home
with only one goal...

4
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:08,159
To save my city.

5
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:10,378
But my old approach
wasn't enough.

6
00:00:10,379 --> 00:00:12,769
I had to become someone else.

7
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:15,308
I had to become something else.

8
00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:18,639
I had to become the green arrow.

9
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:20,578
Previously, on "arrow"...

10
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:22,039
Laurel: The media has
been calling them a ghost.

11
00:00:22,049 --> 00:00:23,809
They're like nothing
we'd ever seen before.

12
00:00:23,819 --> 00:00:25,318
Every time we get too
close to one of them,

13
00:00:25,319 --> 00:00:26,718
They off themselves
with cyanide.

14
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:28,819
Darhk's ghosts, they're hive.

15
00:00:28,829 --> 00:00:31,028
An organization
called hive
killed my brother.

16
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:32,798
Taking lyla, that was
your idea, oliver.

17
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:33,928
In front of our daughter!

18
00:00:33,929 --> 00:00:36,259
You didn't just
lose my friendship...

19
00:00:36,269 --> 00:00:37,868
You lost my respect.

20
00:00:37,869 --> 00:00:39,798
Thea, whatever's
going on with you,

21
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:41,259
The league,
they'll know
what to do.

22
00:00:41,269 --> 00:00:42,729
We're going to nanda parbat.

23
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:45,038
Why are we not
telling my brother?

24
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,239
Because you're not
the only reason for us
going to nanda parbat.

25
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:59,349
Need a hand, john?
I'm good.

26
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,259
Varsity track,
all state, 100 meters.

27
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:20,069
[groans]

28
00:01:27,419 --> 00:01:28,788
Dig?
Felicity!

29
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:31,188
You know where this
son of a bitch went?

30
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:33,258
He vanished.
We call them
ghosts for a reason.

31
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,359
But I got air support
coming in on number two.

32
00:01:37,629 --> 00:01:39,799
I got 'em.

33
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,938
Oliver?

34
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,569
Oliver?

35
00:01:55,579 --> 00:01:56,878
He's all right, felicity.

36
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:58,778
We need eyes back on our target.

37
00:01:58,779 --> 00:02:01,109
I'll give you one
better than that.

38
00:02:02,349 --> 00:02:04,679
[beeping]

39
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:06,929
[engine starts]

40
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:22,138
20 feet ahead. I got one
gift-wrapped for you.

41
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:24,378
Feels like old times,
the three of us.

42
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:25,569
The ogs.

43
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:27,709
The original gangstas.

44
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:36,448
[muffled screaming]

45
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:39,779
You're not checking out
without answering a few
questions first.

46
00:02:39,789 --> 00:02:43,128
Where can I find hive?
Who's behind the ghosts?

47
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,829
Answer me!

48
00:02:47,999 --> 00:02:49,898
Ohh.

49
00:02:49,899 --> 00:02:51,128
Dig!

50
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,929
I'm good. I'm good.

51
00:02:55,539 --> 00:02:58,108
Now he's gone.

52
00:02:58,109 --> 00:02:59,138
Damn it!

53
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:02,199
We need more boots
on the ground, oliver.

54
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:04,339
Thea and laurel picked
a fine day for a spa treatment.

55
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:05,778
I don't think thea
would be very much help

56
00:03:05,779 --> 00:03:07,109
In the state of mind she's in.

57
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:08,819
Where the hell are they, anyway?

58
00:03:10,349 --> 00:03:13,079
[both grunting and yelling]

59
00:03:18,629 --> 00:03:22,129
I really enjoy
sparring with you, nyssa.

60
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:27,129
I'm not sparring.

61
00:03:27,139 --> 00:03:30,709
I know. That's what
makes it so much fun.

62
00:03:40,679 --> 00:03:44,849
You know I would
show you no mercy
if given the opportunity.

63
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:46,858
That's why I take great care

64
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:49,359
Not to give you the opportunity.

65
00:03:53,529 --> 00:03:55,368
Next time I'll take
your head off.

66
00:03:55,369 --> 00:03:58,099
[chuckles]

67
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:03,599
My liege,
two foreigners are here.

68
00:04:03,609 --> 00:04:06,448
One of them claims
to be the daughter
of ra's al ghul.

69
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:09,139
No, I am his daughter.

70
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:11,278
What a pleasant surprise.

71
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:12,209
Sister-in-law.

72
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:15,218
What brings you to nanda parbat?

73
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:17,358
They have a coffin
with them, my liege.

74
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:18,949
A coffin?

75
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,528
I want you to bring
my sister back to life.

76
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:23,988
No.

77
00:04:23,989 --> 00:04:25,919
You took her life away from her.

78
00:04:25,929 --> 00:04:27,664
It is your obligation
to bring her back.

79
00:04:27,665 --> 00:04:29,389
I have no
obligations
in this house.

80
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:32,368
You don't get
to waltz in here
and demand a cup of tea,

81
00:04:32,369 --> 00:04:33,838
Let alone this.

82
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:35,568
Thea wasn't dead.

83
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:37,168
Sara is.

84
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:39,229
Thanks to you.
What you are asking for

85
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:41,799
Hasn't been done in ages' past.

86
00:04:41,809 --> 00:04:43,808
Even then, only in legend.

87
00:04:43,809 --> 00:04:44,969
Which is why
I did not
ask my father

88
00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:46,539
To use the pit to save sara

89
00:04:46,549 --> 00:04:48,018
After she fell.

90
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:49,718
Even if sara went into the pit,

91
00:04:49,719 --> 00:04:50,888
Even if it worked...

92
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:54,358
Who... What came
out of the pit

93
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:55,728
Would not be sara.

94
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:57,958
Laurel,

95
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:00,519
I am sorry, truly sorry,

96
00:05:00,529 --> 00:05:03,799
But of course my answer is no.

97
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:09,874
Ok, I know that was
kind of a bust,

98
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:13,239
But wasn't it fun having
the original team arrow
back together?

99
00:05:15,509 --> 00:05:17,539
You shouldn't have.

100
00:05:17,549 --> 00:05:19,278
Got that off one of the ghosts.

101
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:20,909
It's where they hide
their cyanide capsules.

102
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:22,718
It looks like
an upper left bicuspid.

103
00:05:22,719 --> 00:05:25,758
There was a very brief
time where I envisioned
a future for myself

104
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,088
As a dental hygienist.

105
00:05:28,089 --> 00:05:30,049
The best lead we've
got in the last
three months.

106
00:05:30,059 --> 00:05:33,228
It'll take the dna sequencer
a little bit of time,

107
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:36,368
So I was thinking
margaritas while we wait.

108
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,768
You remember that place
we went after we took
down the dodger?

109
00:05:38,769 --> 00:05:41,068
Ohh.
What do you say?

110
00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:43,968
It's... it's been
a while since it was
just the three of us.

111
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:47,439
I've got a family
to get back to.

112
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:52,578
I guess he just needs more time.

113
00:05:52,579 --> 00:05:54,778
Time hasn't been doing anything.

114
00:05:54,779 --> 00:05:56,039
Apologies haven't.

115
00:05:56,049 --> 00:05:57,148
What are you saying?

116
00:05:57,149 --> 00:06:00,218
I'm saying that I'm done

117
00:06:00,219 --> 00:06:02,519
Waiting for him to come around.

118
00:06:05,929 --> 00:06:08,129
[yelling in distance]

119
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:15,529
Like a fish to water.

120
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:18,808
What did you say?

121
00:06:18,809 --> 00:06:20,708
People gossip.

122
00:06:20,709 --> 00:06:22,678
They say that you're a rich kid

123
00:06:22,679 --> 00:06:24,278
Who got shipwrecked here.

124
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:27,878
Bossing
people around,
giving orders.

125
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:30,479
[scoffs]
must feel just
like home to you.

126
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:35,128
We got a runner!

127
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:37,099
All right, watch the field.

128
00:06:43,229 --> 00:06:46,129
Hey! Come on, man,
let's do this
the easy way.

129
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:50,038
Yeah! That's the way.

130
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:53,379
Well, what you going to do,
talk him into surrendering?

131
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:58,049
That's how you do it.

132
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:16,098
Who are you?

133
00:07:16,099 --> 00:07:20,098
Definitely not someone
who deserves to be shot.

134
00:07:20,099 --> 00:07:22,759
Your wife and kid
are out, by the way.

135
00:07:22,769 --> 00:07:24,368
Who are you?

136
00:07:24,369 --> 00:07:26,669
Relax.

137
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:29,608
I'm a friendly.

138
00:07:29,609 --> 00:07:31,369
You're a.R.G.U.S.?

139
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:33,909
You can read.
Lyla sent me.

140
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,148
My wife left the agency
seven months ago.

141
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:36,679
She couldn't have
sent you anywhere.

142
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:38,588
She asked back
when she was still
with the agency.

143
00:07:38,589 --> 00:07:41,858
Took me a while,
because, well,
favors aren't exactly

144
00:07:41,859 --> 00:07:44,958
At the top of my to-do list.

145
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:47,719
Here. Id on whoever
hired floyd lawton

146
00:07:47,729 --> 00:07:49,319
To do a hit back in '09.

147
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:54,038
Mina fayad?

148
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:55,968
We're going to find her.

149
00:07:55,969 --> 00:07:57,799
Well, that's the best part.

150
00:07:57,809 --> 00:07:59,808
Tsa flagged her
coming in last night.

151
00:07:59,809 --> 00:08:03,848
Flew in from markovia.

152
00:08:03,849 --> 00:08:06,279
I'll hook you up
with her location.

153
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:14,688
Ahh.

154
00:08:14,689 --> 00:08:16,019
Ms. Fayad.

155
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,358
You brought a guest.

156
00:08:18,359 --> 00:08:20,558
As instructed.

157
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:22,419
Not by me.

158
00:08:22,429 --> 00:08:25,089
The vigilante problem
in this city is greater
than anticipated.

159
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:27,629
Your partners in hive
asked me to take steps.

160
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:31,538
He doesn't exactly
look like a problem solver.

161
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:33,199
What do you do?

162
00:08:33,209 --> 00:08:36,908
I play cards. Mostly.

163
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:38,839
Perhaps a demonstration.

164
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:40,148
Funny you should mention.

165
00:08:40,149 --> 00:08:42,018
I happen to have
just the problem.

166
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:47,818
My operatives are under
orders to choose death
before capture.

167
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:50,819
This gentleman chose wrongly.

168
00:08:50,829 --> 00:08:52,758
They got to me
before I could take
the counter measure.

169
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:55,119
He's also prone to excuses,

170
00:08:55,129 --> 00:08:57,559
Which I find tiresome.

171
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:12,048
[laughs]

172
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:14,649
Good.

173
00:09:17,789 --> 00:09:20,118
That one was free.

174
00:09:20,119 --> 00:09:23,619
Taking out the green
arrow and his friends...

175
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:26,429
That'll cost.

176
00:09:28,529 --> 00:09:31,629
Deal.

177
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:47,918
I'm not giving up.

178
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:50,288
I'm never giving up.

179
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:53,258
Because you're thinking
only of yourself.

180
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,158
I expected your support.

181
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:56,928
I was counting on it.

182
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,898
Then you never really
knew me at all.

183
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:01,968
The pit gave my father
a long life,

184
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:05,838
Longer than what
was natural, and much
longer than he deserved.

185
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,098
But he paid a dark price for it.

186
00:10:08,099 --> 00:10:10,329
A price thea
is no doubt paying now.

187
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:13,978
I wouldn't wish it
on my most bitter enemy,

188
00:10:13,979 --> 00:10:15,578
Let alone my beloved.

189
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:19,648
I don't know
if the pit can
bring her back.

190
00:10:19,649 --> 00:10:22,288
And malcolm's right...
I don't know

191
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,488
What sara will be
like if it does.

192
00:10:24,489 --> 00:10:27,688
But what I do
know is that
I have to try.

193
00:10:27,689 --> 00:10:28,758
To what end?

194
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:33,858
To have your sister
return to you a monster?

195
00:10:33,859 --> 00:10:35,859
Her spirit...

196
00:10:35,869 --> 00:10:37,868
The part that we both love...

197
00:10:37,869 --> 00:10:41,504
That's the part that
I have to believe
will come back.

198
00:10:41,505 --> 00:10:43,599
You're not doing
this out of love;

199
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,738
You're doing this out of grief.

200
00:10:45,739 --> 00:10:47,969
I miss sara, too.

201
00:10:47,979 --> 00:10:50,508
But she is gone, laurel.

202
00:10:50,509 --> 00:10:52,839
Forever.

203
00:10:52,849 --> 00:10:54,448
I have accepted it.

204
00:10:54,449 --> 00:10:56,789
I think it's time you did, too.

205
00:11:04,859 --> 00:11:06,859
[beeps]

206
00:11:08,259 --> 00:11:11,059
Still wishing
you were
a dental hygienist?

207
00:11:11,069 --> 00:11:14,538
More like a molecular biologist.

208
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:17,408
You see this?

209
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:18,638
No.

210
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:21,099
In my defense,
I flunked biology.

211
00:11:21,109 --> 00:11:24,014
Well, I got an a+,
and I still have no idea

212
00:11:24,015 --> 00:11:25,639
What the hell is going on here.

213
00:11:25,649 --> 00:11:27,918
This dna has half
of the genetic markers
that it should have.

214
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:29,148
Half.

215
00:11:29,149 --> 00:11:31,448
How is that possible?
It's not.

216
00:11:31,449 --> 00:11:34,079
This guy should be
nothing more than
a pile of goo.

217
00:11:34,089 --> 00:11:35,728
[beeping]
what now?

218
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:39,058
Robbery,
auto parts store,
litchfield ave.

219
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:40,589
Call dig, tell him
we'll meet him there.

220
00:11:40,599 --> 00:11:42,968
Ahh, hold-ups
are a little below
your pay grade.

221
00:11:42,969 --> 00:11:45,738
You sure you don't
want the scpd to
handle this one?

222
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:47,204
How effective have
the police been

223
00:11:47,205 --> 00:11:49,199
At solving the city's
problems recently?

224
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,509
That's a good point.

225
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:09,779
[vibrating]

226
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:16,928
John's still not
answering his phone.

227
00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:18,328
I'll be fine.

228
00:12:18,329 --> 00:12:19,659
Still, I don't like
you going out there

229
00:12:19,669 --> 00:12:22,909
Without back-up.
I'm not. I have you.

230
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,908
That restraint
showed back there?

231
00:12:29,909 --> 00:12:31,269
Bury it.

232
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,318
Violence is the only thing
these losers understand.

233
00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:36,318
Guys out here can't handle that,

234
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:39,988
And they either wash out
or end up doing the product.

235
00:12:39,989 --> 00:12:42,728
Both of which
are fast-tracks
to a bullet in the head.

236
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:45,958
The product...
reiter hasn't told
me a lot about it.

237
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:47,489
He calls it "slam."

238
00:12:47,499 --> 00:12:49,328
A genetically modified hybrid.

239
00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:52,089
One part heroin poppy,
one part coca leaf.

240
00:12:52,099 --> 00:12:53,429
Gets you higher
than the empire state.

241
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,138
Conklin! We got a problem.

242
00:12:56,139 --> 00:12:58,408
Some slam's missing.
A whole cake.

243
00:12:58,409 --> 00:13:01,208
The runner was just
a distraction.

244
00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:04,348
Any idea who did it?

245
00:13:04,349 --> 00:13:05,748
All right, then.

246
00:13:05,749 --> 00:13:07,018
Round 'em up.

247
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:08,888
What are you going to do?

248
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:11,519
I told you...
there's only one thing
these losers respond to.

249
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:26,568
Get on the ground.

250
00:13:26,569 --> 00:13:28,768
Thanks for coming, by the way.

251
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:30,268
Ms. Fayad wasn't
sure it would work,

252
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:32,029
But I knew you
couldn't turn down

253
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:33,999
A good old-fashioned
robbery.

254
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,539
[both grunting]

255
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:20,979
You ready to call this yet?

256
00:14:34,669 --> 00:14:36,168
[groaning]

257
00:14:36,169 --> 00:14:37,999
Now you can call it.

258
00:14:38,009 --> 00:14:39,709
The game's not over yet.

259
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,958
[tires squealing]

260
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:57,829
[both grunting]

261
00:15:18,609 --> 00:15:21,078
Are you all right?

262
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:24,148
Aside from the fact
that you won't
help my friends?

263
00:15:24,149 --> 00:15:26,579
I wouldn't be helping sara.

264
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:29,028
As you know more than anyone.

265
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:31,028
What gave me away?

266
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:34,164
When I was cautioning laurel
about the effects of the pit,

267
00:15:34,165 --> 00:15:35,759
I saw the look on your face.

268
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:38,198
You're feeling it, aren't you?

269
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:40,159
The blood lust.

270
00:15:40,169 --> 00:15:42,738
What's happening to me?

271
00:15:42,739 --> 00:15:45,038
The pit contains traces
of the souls of all the men

272
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:46,869
And women who have
bathed in its waters.

273
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:50,108
And what those waters restore,
they can also take.

274
00:15:50,109 --> 00:15:51,608
Life for live.

275
00:15:51,609 --> 00:15:53,539
So what are you saying?

276
00:15:53,549 --> 00:15:56,018
That you need
to feed this impulse.

277
00:15:56,019 --> 00:15:57,788
Give into it.

278
00:15:57,789 --> 00:16:00,758
Once you do it,
it will subside
for a time.

279
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:01,818
Ok.

280
00:16:01,819 --> 00:16:04,988
I'll just go on a killing spree.

281
00:16:04,989 --> 00:16:08,189
Thank you
for the fatherly advice.

282
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:10,198
Can you just,
for a... a second,

283
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:12,068
Pretend to be a normal father?

284
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:14,238
Can you do that, dad?

285
00:16:14,239 --> 00:16:17,839
Do you have anything
remotely normal
to offer me?

286
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:21,678
All right.

287
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:24,748
There is something
high in the mountains.

288
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:26,518
A man.

289
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:28,618
[exhales] some call him a sage.

290
00:16:28,619 --> 00:16:31,888
He has a way
with the ancient
arts of healing.

291
00:16:31,889 --> 00:16:34,088
He may be able
to help you with this,

292
00:16:34,089 --> 00:16:36,888
Though I am not sure.

293
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:39,889
Does that qualify
as being normal?

294
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,498
Normal enough.

295
00:16:42,499 --> 00:16:44,798
Get some rest.

296
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,939
We'll start at first light.

297
00:16:54,309 --> 00:16:56,448
This hurt?

298
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,148
Yes, it stings.
Good.

299
00:16:58,149 --> 00:17:00,588
That's what you get
for trying to take on
a meta all by yourself.

300
00:17:00,589 --> 00:17:02,109
A meta?
Yeah.

301
00:17:02,119 --> 00:17:05,188
It turns out
central city
is missing one.

302
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:06,618
Jeremy tell.

303
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:08,879
Cisco says we should
call him double down,

304
00:17:08,889 --> 00:17:10,519
Which doesn't
exactly make sense,

305
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,998
Since he was getting
a tattoo when the dark
matter wave hit.

306
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:14,464
You missed quite a show tonight.

307
00:17:14,465 --> 00:17:15,859
Sorry I couldn't help out.

308
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,568
It's a long story.
Oh, my god,

309
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,038
It is not a long story.

310
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,738
It is the shortest
story in history.

311
00:17:20,739 --> 00:17:22,668
Two guys go take on criminals

312
00:17:22,669 --> 00:17:23,899
Without asking
for back-up

313
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:25,738
And nearly get killed
in the process.

314
00:17:25,739 --> 00:17:27,899
You know, I haven't said
anything up till now,

315
00:17:27,909 --> 00:17:29,878
Because I was hoping
that the two of you

316
00:17:29,879 --> 00:17:32,418
Would remove your heads
from your own asses
without assistance.

317
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:33,618
Turns out I was wrong.

318
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,384
Hey!
No, no! This is the part

319
00:17:35,385 --> 00:17:36,879
Where I talk and you two listen.

320
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,658
The both of you
nearly got killed
out there tonight

321
00:17:38,659 --> 00:17:40,849
Because you didn't have
each other's backs.

322
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:43,258
That was a one-time
deal, felicity,
it won't happen again.

323
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:44,788
I absolutely agree.

324
00:17:44,789 --> 00:17:47,089
Because the two of you
are going to sit down here

325
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,568
Until you have
resolved your issues.

326
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,389
Do we have an understanding?

327
00:17:50,399 --> 00:17:51,798
I...

328
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:53,829
Do we have an understanding?!

329
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,068
Yeah.

330
00:17:56,069 --> 00:17:58,368
I'm going to take this
to a guy at palmer tech

331
00:17:58,369 --> 00:17:59,969
To find out how
some lunatic meta

332
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:02,178
Turns tattoos
into lethal weapons.

333
00:18:02,179 --> 00:18:04,478
If you two haven't
figured out your issues

334
00:18:04,479 --> 00:18:07,888
By the time I get back,
I'm going to find a bunch
of mirakuru soldiers

335
00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:10,109
To knock some sense into you.

336
00:18:23,929 --> 00:18:26,659
It's been months, man.

337
00:18:26,669 --> 00:18:30,438
And... I... I don't
know how many
apologies.

338
00:18:30,439 --> 00:18:32,838
John, you're
a forgiving person...

339
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:35,669
Oliver, this isn't
about forgiveness, man.

340
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:39,078
I don't know how to move
forward with this...

341
00:18:39,079 --> 00:18:40,739
Us doing what we do.

342
00:18:40,749 --> 00:18:42,588
We've worked fine
since I got back.

343
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:44,388
We got lucky.

344
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:46,158
Oliver, there was a time

345
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:48,088
I would have taken
a bullet for you.

346
00:18:48,089 --> 00:18:50,028
And I don't know
if I would do that now.

347
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:52,058
Which means that even
when we're out there,

348
00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:53,919
We are not out there together.

349
00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:55,628
You crossed a line, man.

350
00:18:55,629 --> 00:18:57,089
And the fact that
you could do that again

351
00:18:57,099 --> 00:18:58,868
Sits in the back
of my head somewhere.

352
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:00,698
I get it! I get it.

353
00:19:00,699 --> 00:19:03,699
I understand that
I crossed a line.

354
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,738
I understand that
I lost your trust.

355
00:19:05,739 --> 00:19:07,699
What I do not understand

356
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:10,208
Is why you won't
give me a chance

357
00:19:10,209 --> 00:19:12,369
To earn it back.

358
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:22,728
You think this meta tonight
is connected to darhk?

359
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:24,928
I don't know.

360
00:19:24,929 --> 00:19:28,328
Uh... He mentioned
a new player,

361
00:19:28,329 --> 00:19:32,399
A woman. Uh, fayad.

362
00:19:35,099 --> 00:19:36,559
We need to go.

363
00:19:36,569 --> 00:19:38,499
Where?

364
00:19:38,509 --> 00:19:42,879
Some place where I'm going
to try to trust you again.

365
00:19:46,819 --> 00:19:51,718
I like to think
of all of us as a team.

366
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:54,158
Teammates need
to trust each other.

367
00:19:54,159 --> 00:19:57,298
Right now,
I'm having a little
difficulty doing that.

368
00:19:57,299 --> 00:20:00,989
Why don't one
of y'all tell me
who stole the product,

369
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:03,269
Or else this man right here
is going to eat a bullet.

370
00:20:04,999 --> 00:20:06,798
Nobody?

371
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,359
Hmm.
[gunshot]

372
00:20:09,369 --> 00:20:11,668
Let's try this again.

373
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:15,199
Hey! Wait! Wait, wait, wait.

374
00:20:15,209 --> 00:20:18,008
You said the violence
is the only thing
these people respond to.

375
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:20,478
Well, it doesn't
seem to be working.

376
00:20:20,479 --> 00:20:23,039
Well, what do you
have in mind?
Harsh language?

377
00:20:23,049 --> 00:20:24,879
I've been on this island
three years,

378
00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:27,358
Learned some things.
About what?

379
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:30,189
Pain.

380
00:20:34,329 --> 00:20:36,668
Ahem.

381
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:38,628
Uh-oh.

382
00:20:38,629 --> 00:20:40,629
Um...
Uh-oh?

383
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:43,568
Those aren't the words
you want to say when
your ceo walks into a room.

384
00:20:43,569 --> 00:20:46,599
Well, technically "uh"
and "oh" aren't words,
they're interjections...

385
00:20:46,609 --> 00:20:48,278
Please tell me these
are the prototypes

386
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:50,078
For our new
world-changing
technology.

387
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:51,878
Well, since I'm inventing them,
wouldn't that make them my...

388
00:20:51,879 --> 00:20:53,139
What is this?

389
00:20:53,149 --> 00:20:55,348
Contact lenses
with built-in
hd displays.

390
00:20:55,349 --> 00:20:56,879
Whoo, that's
impressive,
and fast.

391
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:58,288
How much would they sell for?

392
00:20:58,289 --> 00:20:59,858
Hundred thousand.

393
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:01,128
Hundred thousand dollars?

394
00:21:01,129 --> 00:21:03,988
Per lens.
[cell phone vibrating]

395
00:21:03,989 --> 00:21:05,519
Hmm.

396
00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:07,128
Everything ok?

397
00:21:07,129 --> 00:21:08,764
Yeah, my phone
just keeps acting up.

398
00:21:08,765 --> 00:21:10,319
I'm going to restart it.

399
00:21:10,329 --> 00:21:12,929
Ooh, what's this?

400
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:15,638
Ahh! Uh, this is
an autonomous

401
00:21:15,639 --> 00:21:17,939
Communications
device. Uh...

402
00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:22,408
Which is great, uh,
except for the fact

403
00:21:22,409 --> 00:21:24,869
That it spontaneous
explodes. [chuckles]

404
00:21:24,879 --> 00:21:26,678
Ok, maybe you need something

405
00:21:26,679 --> 00:21:27,909
To get your mind off all this.

406
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,418
I got a little side project,

407
00:21:29,419 --> 00:21:30,548
Clear your head.

408
00:21:30,549 --> 00:21:31,979
Like gambling?

409
00:21:31,989 --> 00:21:33,718
I need
a full work-up.

410
00:21:33,719 --> 00:21:35,049
It's possible
it's made out of some

411
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:36,588
Sort of bio-organic
material.

412
00:21:36,589 --> 00:21:37,788
I need to know everything

413
00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:39,419
That you can find out about it.

414
00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:40,628
Hmm, strange.
Hmm?

415
00:21:40,629 --> 00:21:42,128
These edges.

416
00:21:42,129 --> 00:21:43,619
Doesn't look
mass-manufactured.
Where'd you find it?

417
00:21:43,629 --> 00:21:45,289
Casino.

418
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:46,359
You gamble?

419
00:21:46,369 --> 00:21:48,138
Oh, yeah,
all the time.
Poker's my jam.

420
00:21:48,139 --> 00:21:49,268
It ruined an outside
flush for me.

421
00:21:49,269 --> 00:21:51,368
I think my opponent
was cheating.

422
00:21:51,369 --> 00:21:53,599
So you want me
to check it for evidence

423
00:21:53,609 --> 00:21:55,078
Of marking or something?

424
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:56,748
Yeah, anything
strange, out
of the ordinary.

425
00:21:56,749 --> 00:21:58,449
Like... You playing poker?

426
00:21:59,649 --> 00:22:01,684
I will check back in
on you later.

427
00:22:01,685 --> 00:22:03,279
Oh, and, uh, miss smoak,

428
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:05,758
There's no such thing
as an outside flush

429
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:07,079
In poker.

430
00:22:07,089 --> 00:22:10,999
That's probably why I lost.

431
00:22:16,929 --> 00:22:19,359
Remember in russia,

432
00:22:19,369 --> 00:22:21,608
Two years ago
when we got lyla
out of that prison?

433
00:22:21,609 --> 00:22:23,029
Of course.

434
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,374
That night, lawton
told me that my brother

435
00:22:25,375 --> 00:22:27,499
Was not collateral
damage in a hit
gone bad;

436
00:22:27,509 --> 00:22:29,138
That he was the target.

437
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:32,469
And that lawton was hired
by an organization
called hive.

438
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:34,978
The other week,
you reacted when I said

439
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:38,209
That ra's called
darhk's men a "hive"
of operatives.

440
00:22:38,219 --> 00:22:40,088
Mm-hmm.

441
00:22:40,089 --> 00:22:41,928
[sighs] could be a coincidence.

442
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:44,449
I don't think so.

443
00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:53,129
John: Last page.

444
00:22:53,139 --> 00:22:56,338
That woman hired lawton

445
00:22:56,339 --> 00:22:58,338
To kill my brother,
and I'm betting

446
00:22:58,339 --> 00:23:00,648
She hired that meta that
tried to take you out.

447
00:23:00,649 --> 00:23:01,838
Based on what?

448
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,408
Her name is mina fayad.

449
00:23:04,409 --> 00:23:06,009
[exhales]

450
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:08,348
Two years and you
didn't tell me.

451
00:23:08,349 --> 00:23:10,988
We have more
in common
than you think.

452
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:15,129
Oliver, that's
my first legitimate lead.

453
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:19,658
I have to find her.

454
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:22,258
Ms. Fayad hired you
for one job.

455
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:25,159
One. Against
my objections,

456
00:23:25,169 --> 00:23:27,168
And only because
my associates
are anxious

457
00:23:27,169 --> 00:23:28,368
To progress to phase three.

458
00:23:28,369 --> 00:23:30,368
We shouldn't
talk about genesis...

459
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:32,629
Don't lecture me about secrecy.

460
00:23:32,639 --> 00:23:36,999
Particularly on the same
night that you were
just compromised.

461
00:23:37,009 --> 00:23:38,539
I...
In the same night

462
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:39,748
That I lost good men

463
00:23:39,749 --> 00:23:41,188
In the name of protecting you.

464
00:23:41,189 --> 00:23:44,349
Damian...
Mr. Darhk!

465
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:49,549
I think I require
another demonstration.

[scoffs]

467
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:55,419
What, you want me
to kill her now?

00:23:55,429 --> 00:23:58,328
Show me.

I still get paid?

00:24:05,539 --> 00:24:08,239
Do it.

What are you?

Ms. Fayad, many
members of hive,

They consider me to be
a charlatan.

any doubt as to how

00:25:20,719 --> 00:25:23,388
How do I...

486
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:25,818
How do I feel?

487
00:25:25,819 --> 00:25:27,579
[gasping]

488
00:25:27,589 --> 00:25:30,158
Oh, my god.

489
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,928
There's no sage.

490
00:25:32,929 --> 00:25:34,958
There is no cure.

491
00:25:34,959 --> 00:25:36,259
There never was.

492
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:38,468
I'm sorry.
You will be
compelled to kill

493
00:25:38,469 --> 00:25:41,638
Until you've slain
the one who hurt you.

494
00:25:41,639 --> 00:25:43,008
But I can't.

495
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:45,408
Ok, ra's is already dead!

496
00:25:45,409 --> 00:25:47,008
And the only way to cope

497
00:25:47,009 --> 00:25:49,608
Is to indulge
the blood lust
on others.

498
00:25:49,609 --> 00:25:51,469
So you...

499
00:25:51,479 --> 00:25:54,648
You just set your men up
to be slaughtered?

500
00:25:54,649 --> 00:25:58,218
You will not feel
the hunger to kill
again for weeks.

501
00:25:58,219 --> 00:26:00,458
No need to thank me.

502
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:03,888
There is nothing I wouldn't do

503
00:26:03,889 --> 00:26:07,089
To help my daughter.

504
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,459
I hope we learned a lesson

505
00:26:16,469 --> 00:26:18,799
Of the benefits
of trusting our friends
with our problems.

506
00:26:18,809 --> 00:26:20,908
You mean like your boyfriend?
You're supposed to be

507
00:26:20,909 --> 00:26:23,048
More evolved than him.
Hmm?

508
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:24,808
Sorry, but he is.

509
00:26:24,809 --> 00:26:26,469
Can we find her?!

510
00:26:26,479 --> 00:26:29,009
Nope. She's not coming up
on any of our traffic

511
00:26:29,019 --> 00:26:31,718
Or security cams,
but I think I have
the next best thing.

512
00:26:31,719 --> 00:26:34,328
Her cell phone, or at least
the one that followed her
through airport security

513
00:26:34,329 --> 00:26:35,579
On the way to star city.

514
00:26:35,589 --> 00:26:37,649
Where's her phone now?

515
00:26:37,659 --> 00:26:40,499
Redmond and eighth.

516
00:26:41,829 --> 00:26:44,299
[screaming and sobbing]

517
00:26:46,499 --> 00:26:50,259
What fancy private school
did you pick this up in?

518
00:26:50,269 --> 00:26:52,269
I learned it here.

519
00:26:53,209 --> 00:26:54,778
Three years on this island,

520
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,048
And I have been hurt
every way you can imagine.

521
00:26:57,049 --> 00:27:00,618
I know what kills,
I know what cripples,

522
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,078
And what just hurts.

523
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,439
[screaming]

524
00:27:03,449 --> 00:27:05,248
Stop!

525
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:07,979
Stop! He didn't
take the drugs.

526
00:27:07,989 --> 00:27:09,288
I did.

527
00:27:09,289 --> 00:27:12,488
You're working us too hard.

528
00:27:12,489 --> 00:27:15,089
And some of the other
prisoners are hurt.

529
00:27:15,099 --> 00:27:18,798
I wanted to give them
something for the pain.

530
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,468
And where's the slam now?

531
00:27:20,469 --> 00:27:23,368
It's all used up.
And I'm not going

532
00:27:23,369 --> 00:27:25,368
To tell you by who.
So if you're going
to kill me,

533
00:27:25,369 --> 00:27:27,099
Just get on with it.

534
00:27:27,109 --> 00:27:29,078
Suit yourself.

535
00:27:29,079 --> 00:27:31,608
Wait, wait, wait.

536
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:35,609
[sighs] you've already
executed one prisoner today.

537
00:27:35,619 --> 00:27:37,388
How's reiter going
to feel about you

538
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:38,758
Exterminating his work force?

539
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:42,218
I think he'd make
an exception for a thief.

540
00:27:42,219 --> 00:27:45,619
Well, I'd just
make her disappear.

541
00:27:45,629 --> 00:27:48,358
Take her some place.

542
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:50,819
They'll never find the body.

543
00:27:55,899 --> 00:27:57,899
All right. Take her.

544
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:59,439
Keep him company.

545
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:11,179
Wake up.

546
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,018
Wake up, we need to go.
What?

547
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:15,849
It was a mistake to come here.
Thea.

548
00:28:15,859 --> 00:28:17,828
Stay the hell away from me.

549
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:18,994
Thea, what's wrong?

550
00:28:18,995 --> 00:28:20,519
He's not going to help sara

551
00:28:20,529 --> 00:28:21,968
And he's not going to help me!

552
00:28:21,969 --> 00:28:24,459
Thea!
Don't talk to me!

553
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:25,798
I was only trying to help you.

554
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:27,059
Help me?

555
00:28:27,069 --> 00:28:28,268
Yeah, that's funny

556
00:28:28,269 --> 00:28:29,368
On more than a few levels.

557
00:28:29,369 --> 00:28:31,599
My favorite
is you are the reason

558
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:34,478
Why I am like this
in the first place.
I know.

559
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:37,848
I will not kill people.

560
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:39,778
I won't!

561
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:42,209
Stay out of my life

562
00:28:42,219 --> 00:28:44,988
And the hell away from me!

563
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:47,058
We are bound together forever.

564
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:50,058
You and me, father and daughter.

565
00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:52,928
Let me prove it to you.

566
00:28:52,929 --> 00:28:54,128
How?

567
00:28:54,129 --> 00:28:56,398
I am responsible
for sara's death,

568
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,968
Yet I have the means
to make it right,

569
00:28:58,969 --> 00:29:00,038
Or at least try to.

570
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:02,268
Do you think after

571
00:29:02,269 --> 00:29:04,438
Knowing what that pit
has done to me,

572
00:29:04,439 --> 00:29:07,508
That I would let that
happen to sara?!

573
00:29:07,509 --> 00:29:09,708
I think if you are truly
sincere in fighting
your blood lust,

574
00:29:09,709 --> 00:29:12,408
You would offer
the same to sara.

575
00:29:12,409 --> 00:29:14,609
What are you saying?

576
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:16,148
That I am willing to heal

577
00:29:16,149 --> 00:29:17,279
My daughter's conscience

578
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:21,918
By restoring your sister's life.

579
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,179
That we should prepare

580
00:29:24,189 --> 00:29:26,349
Sara's body for the ceremony.

581
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:35,459
[beeping]

582
00:29:35,469 --> 00:29:38,208
I'm still getting a ping
off ms. Fayad's cell phone,

583
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:39,809
Ten feet ahead.

584
00:29:44,709 --> 00:29:47,509
Oliver: John...

585
00:29:56,589 --> 00:29:59,989
It was my first chance
for answers.

586
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:01,698
My last chance.

587
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:04,798
I'm sorry.
Don't be, oliver.

588
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,938
This isn't your fault.
It's mine.

589
00:30:07,939 --> 00:30:10,168
I should have trusted you.

590
00:30:10,169 --> 00:30:14,769
Told you about this forever ago.

591
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:18,118
If I had, she wouldn't
have gotten away
from me earlier.

592
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:19,709
Would be alive,

593
00:30:19,719 --> 00:30:21,448
Enough now, for some answers.

594
00:30:21,449 --> 00:30:23,288
We're going to get answers.

595
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:24,788
Oliver, I haven't been able

596
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:26,388
To get answers for more
than two years now!

597
00:30:26,389 --> 00:30:29,218
For more than two years...

598
00:30:29,219 --> 00:30:31,919
You've been doing this alone.

599
00:30:39,229 --> 00:30:41,798
Frack.

600
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:43,659
You want me to take a look at
your phone for you, miss smoak?

601
00:30:43,669 --> 00:30:45,668
I think we've reached
the point in our
working relationship

602
00:30:45,669 --> 00:30:47,399
Where you can call me felicity.

603
00:30:47,409 --> 00:30:50,278
Have you ever considered
how ironic your name is?

604
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:54,648
"felicity" refers
to the ability to find
appropriate expression

605
00:30:54,649 --> 00:30:56,818
For one's thoughts,
which is not exactly

606
00:30:56,819 --> 00:30:58,518
Something you're
particularly good at.

607
00:30:58,519 --> 00:30:59,658
Yeah, you're right,
let's stick with miss smoak.

608
00:30:59,659 --> 00:31:01,379
Any luck on our playing card?

609
00:31:01,389 --> 00:31:04,058
Yeah, it's actually
right there, felic...

610
00:31:04,059 --> 00:31:05,688
Uh, miss smoak.
Mm-hmm.

611
00:31:05,689 --> 00:31:07,889
Uh, except it's not
a playing card at all,

612
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:08,964
Now, in my experience,

613
00:31:08,965 --> 00:31:10,889
Playing cards don't
contain motor proteins,

614
00:31:10,899 --> 00:31:13,438
Proprioreceptors
and a neural net.

615
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:14,868
The responsible thing
to do would be able

616
00:31:14,869 --> 00:31:16,238
To get this back
to its rightful owner.

617
00:31:16,239 --> 00:31:19,068
Is there any way
to track him down?

618
00:31:19,069 --> 00:31:21,369
Well, if you tell me
the truth about where
you got it from,

619
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,108
That could speed
along the process.

620
00:31:23,109 --> 00:31:25,139
I did tell you the truth.

621
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:27,378
I did. Now,
tracking the owner?

622
00:31:27,379 --> 00:31:29,139
You see this ink here,
for lack of a better word?

623
00:31:29,149 --> 00:31:32,109
It's magnetite,
which is the key
component to tattoo ink.

624
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:34,358
You don't say.
I do. I also say

625
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:37,158
That magnetite happens
to guide the internal
compass of birds,

626
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:38,728
Specifically homing pigeons.

627
00:31:38,729 --> 00:31:40,858
So is it possible
to use the magnetite
in the card

628
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:42,458
To get a location on our, um,

629
00:31:42,459 --> 00:31:43,619
Poker player?

630
00:31:43,629 --> 00:31:45,659
Theoretically.
Though, if your

631
00:31:45,669 --> 00:31:48,108
Hypothetical poker
opponent has a deck
full of these cards,

632
00:31:48,109 --> 00:31:50,999
He'll probably be able
to find you faster.

633
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:53,609
Curtis, we have to...

634
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:56,978
I'm going to make
you two a deal.

635
00:31:56,979 --> 00:32:00,978
First one to tell me
where you can find
the green arrow...

636
00:32:00,979 --> 00:32:02,409
Gets to live.

637
00:32:02,419 --> 00:32:04,288
Green arrow?
I have a better idea...

638
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:05,819
Run!

639
00:32:09,289 --> 00:32:11,288
Miss smoak, I really
need to know what's
going on here!

640
00:32:11,289 --> 00:32:13,189
Here!

641
00:32:13,199 --> 00:32:15,558
Does the board of directors

642
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:18,159
Know there's a secret
elevator in the building?

643
00:32:19,869 --> 00:32:22,068
Since when are you
such a bad ass?

644
00:32:22,069 --> 00:32:23,938
Since always.
Ok, I have multiple questions.

645
00:32:23,939 --> 00:32:26,638
Ok, obviously
there's a very long
explanation to this.

646
00:32:26,639 --> 00:32:28,669
The short version
is that I work
with the green arrow,

647
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:31,348
This man is trying
to kill me...
well, us, sorry...

648
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:33,778
And I'm taking us down
to the only place that
we're going to be safe.

649
00:32:33,779 --> 00:32:35,178
The lobby?

650
00:32:35,179 --> 00:32:36,309
Not exactly.

651
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:38,459
[elevator dings]

652
00:32:41,019 --> 00:32:42,579
You have a hidden floor.

653
00:32:42,589 --> 00:32:46,449
We should be safe here,
but just in case...

654
00:32:46,459 --> 00:32:50,089
Aaah!

655
00:32:50,099 --> 00:32:52,038
I think I know
where I can find
the green arrow.

656
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:55,198
Which means that offer
about not killing you
is off the table.

657
00:32:55,199 --> 00:32:56,859
Stay here.
Do not move.

658
00:32:56,869 --> 00:32:58,768
Do you even know
how to use that thing?

659
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:00,669
No.

I'm here, I'm here, ok?

663
00:33:42,449 --> 00:33:43,988
What happened?

664
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:47,218
Your meta came back
to retrieve his
ace of spades.

665
00:33:47,219 --> 00:33:49,249
And you...
You fended him off?

666
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:50,728
Don't sound so surprised.

667
00:33:50,729 --> 00:33:52,888
Ok, I had a little bit
of help from a co-worker,

668
00:33:52,889 --> 00:33:54,819
But to be honest,
he was more freaked
out than I was.

669
00:33:54,829 --> 00:33:56,258
Is he all right?
Yes, he's fine.

670
00:33:56,259 --> 00:33:57,519
I sent him to starling general.

671
00:33:57,529 --> 00:33:59,528
And he only knows
about my secret,
not yours.

672
00:33:59,529 --> 00:34:00,929
If he can trace
the cards back here,

673
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:02,309
Can we use the cards
to trace back to him?

674
00:34:02,299 --> 00:34:03,359
That is exactly what curtis,

I got something. He's headed
for the star city expressway,

Probably high-tailing his
way back to central city.

going to make it.
