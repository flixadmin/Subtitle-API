1
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,889
Bastard.

2
00:00:54,977 --> 00:00:58,939
- Let's make a bet. I'm for the boss.
- I'm betting on the boss, too.

3
00:00:59,064 --> 00:01:01,692
This one is going to be easy.
They always let the boss win.

4
00:01:01,817 --> 00:01:05,487
That's true, but if someone's going
to beat him, it's this guy.

5
00:01:12,077 --> 00:01:15,080
<i>Tell me something. Are you a pussy?</i>

6
00:01:22,254 --> 00:01:23,338
Son of a bitch.

7
00:01:33,181 --> 00:01:35,434
- What's going on?
- You're a little slow, son.

8
00:01:37,436 --> 00:01:40,981
Careful, son, careful!
Keep looking forward, son!

9
00:01:50,282 --> 00:01:51,950
Oh, Shit!

10
00:01:52,701 --> 00:01:55,787
All right, boys,
start getting that money out.

11
00:02:04,963 --> 00:02:07,007
...eighty. I'm missing 20.

12
00:02:07,132 --> 00:02:09,092
Oh, it looks like
you won some money, eh?

13
00:02:09,217 --> 00:02:11,303
Of course,
we're enjoying ourselves, boss.

14
00:02:11,428 --> 00:02:12,679
Very good, son.

15
00:02:13,347 --> 00:02:17,392
- Very good.
- What? Did he get pissed?

16
00:02:17,517 --> 00:02:18,810
Hey.

17
00:02:20,854 --> 00:02:22,689
Do you know why you won?

18
00:02:24,483 --> 00:02:29,321
That little trick. The same one, right?

19
00:02:29,446 --> 00:02:32,282
Don't be an idiot.
You know why you lost, Pablo?

20
00:02:32,407 --> 00:02:33,492
Why?

21
00:02:33,617 --> 00:02:36,828
Because you're a very smart guy,
but you're too stubborn.

22
00:02:36,953 --> 00:02:38,080
You understand?

23
00:02:38,205 --> 00:02:42,459
What I understand is I don't like to lose.
Especially because of tricks.

24
00:02:42,584 --> 00:02:45,962
- Someone had to teach you how to lose.
- Yeah, why?

25
00:02:47,798 --> 00:02:50,300
- Very well, you son of a bitch.
- Boss?

26
00:02:51,468 --> 00:02:54,596
- A photo?
- Sure, but not with that pansy.

27
00:02:54,721 --> 00:02:59,184
No. You go over there.
Over there, motherfucker.

28
00:02:59,309 --> 00:03:00,894
Cousin.

29
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,605
It's because he doesn't know
how to lose, but that's fine.

30
00:03:04,106 --> 00:03:06,525
- Where are we headed, guys?
- To the whores!

31
00:03:15,158 --> 00:03:17,911
Look how they left this place.

32
00:03:21,832 --> 00:03:26,586
We found both the guards.
Stuffed into a trunk, burned alive.

33
00:03:27,504 --> 00:03:29,131
Did anybody see anything?

34
00:03:30,382 --> 00:03:34,636
We're sending spotters out, but...
they either come back with nothing or...

35
00:03:34,761 --> 00:03:37,389
- Or what?
- Or they don't come back.

36
00:03:42,936 --> 00:03:46,440
That bitch Judy Moncada did this.

37
00:03:47,232 --> 00:03:51,027
But she couldn't do this alone.
No fucking way.

38
00:03:51,153 --> 00:03:53,488
The guys that came at me
had high-end weapons.

39
00:03:54,072 --> 00:03:55,240
Big ones.

40
00:03:57,117 --> 00:03:58,285
Gringo shit.

41
00:04:06,835 --> 00:04:08,879
The Cali cartel.

42
00:04:11,089 --> 00:04:12,716
I fucking know it.

43
00:04:14,468 --> 00:04:17,137
Those sons of bitches will regret it.

44
00:04:17,262 --> 00:04:22,392
I will personally burn that fucking city
to the ground.

45
00:04:22,517 --> 00:04:23,810
We don't know that Pablo.

46
00:04:24,311 --> 00:04:28,690
Until we know who did it, we can't attack
the Cali cartel. It would be a mistake.

47
00:04:38,074 --> 00:04:42,162
Get whoever we can out on the street.
Give them cash.

48
00:04:42,287 --> 00:04:46,208
And if anyone needs more persuasion,
motivate them.

49
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:52,881
Put the word out. We're going to kill
all the bastards who did this.

50
00:04:53,006 --> 00:04:55,425
I know I hit one of them.

51
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:59,012
Let's hope he's still breathing.

52
00:05:00,138 --> 00:05:01,556
Because then...

53
00:05:04,059 --> 00:05:10,357
we can find out who that son of a bitch
is working for.

54
00:07:27,661 --> 00:07:31,581
{\an8}PABLO MERRY CHRISTMAS
LOS PEPES

55
00:07:31,706 --> 00:07:35,293
HAPPY HOLIDAYS

56
00:07:38,088 --> 00:07:39,339
Good day.

57
00:07:39,464 --> 00:07:44,970
In a letter sent to the media, a group
that identifies itself as "Los PEPES",

58
00:07:45,095 --> 00:07:48,640
an acronym for
"People Persecuted by Pablo Escobar."

59
00:07:48,765 --> 00:07:51,518
<i>...or "People Persecuted
by Pablo Escobar,"</i>

60
00:07:51,643 --> 00:07:56,314
<i>the vigilantes waging war on those
associated with the notorious drug lord.</i>

61
00:07:56,439 --> 00:08:02,570
Mr President, the media is asking
for a comment on Los PEPES.

62
00:08:02,696 --> 00:08:05,532
It's only a matter of time
before it's made public.

63
00:08:05,657 --> 00:08:07,492
Acknowledgement isn't the same
as condemning.

64
00:08:07,617 --> 00:08:12,998
Sooner or later, you'll have to make
an official public statement.

65
00:08:13,123 --> 00:08:15,959
They're doing God's work
as far as I'm concerned.

66
00:08:16,084 --> 00:08:21,715
- That can't be our official position.
- It can be our official position...

67
00:08:23,967 --> 00:08:25,010
Gentlemen!

68
00:08:27,595 --> 00:08:31,766
Los PEPES is a vigilante death squad.

69
00:08:31,891 --> 00:08:34,769
We'll take care of them
when the time comes.

70
00:08:35,854 --> 00:08:39,107
But for now, let's focus
on our own efforts to catch Escobar.

71
00:08:40,066 --> 00:08:43,319
I believe that's proven
a big enough job for all of us.

72
00:08:43,445 --> 00:08:45,572
Our communications department

73
00:08:45,697 --> 00:08:48,283
has picked up conversations
in the Manrique district

74
00:08:48,408 --> 00:08:53,872
between Jairo, who is one of Escobar's
<i>sicarios,</i> and his mother, who is ill.

75
00:08:53,997 --> 00:08:57,834
We know Jairo is her only child
and likely to visit her.

76
00:08:58,585 --> 00:09:02,589
We'll continue to monitor the frequencies
for further information.

77
00:09:02,714 --> 00:09:04,090
One more thing.

78
00:09:04,215 --> 00:09:07,719
I don't have to tell you that there's
another group now operating in Medellin,

79
00:09:07,844 --> 00:09:10,722
combating Escobar: Los PEPES.

80
00:09:10,847 --> 00:09:12,348
Let me be very clear.

81
00:09:14,059 --> 00:09:20,815
There must and will be a clear line
between them and us.

82
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,692
- Understood?
- Yes, Colonel.

83
00:09:22,817 --> 00:09:24,486
Dismissed, thank you.

84
00:10:11,449 --> 00:10:13,201
CNP's been busy with wiretaps.

85
00:10:13,326 --> 00:10:17,413
They picked up chatter
from Jairo's mum here... and here.

86
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:24,254
Search Bloc won't be able to move until
they get corroboration he's in the area.

87
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:26,422
Which could take days.

88
00:10:26,548 --> 00:10:30,927
Even longer... for them to find the house.

89
00:10:31,845 --> 00:10:37,142
I think... Jairo is planning a homecoming.

90
00:10:38,101 --> 00:10:39,310
Maybe even today.

91
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:47,068
I'll see what I can find out
on the streets.

92
00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:56,536
- Hello?
- <i>Listen up, Carlos.</i>

93
00:10:56,661 --> 00:10:59,831
I have information that Jairo
is going to his mother's.

94
00:11:19,893 --> 00:11:22,395
- National Police, can you open up?
- What do you need?

95
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,063
Open up. Hurry. Hurry.

96
00:11:40,496 --> 00:11:42,248
Don't make me kill you
in front of your mother.

97
00:11:42,373 --> 00:11:43,374
Don't touch her!

98
00:11:43,499 --> 00:11:45,752
Relax, mother, relax.

99
00:11:49,339 --> 00:11:52,217
Ma'am, if you don't cooperate,
we won't be able to find your son.

100
00:11:52,342 --> 00:11:56,137
But I don't know where he is.
I didn't notice anything.

101
00:11:56,262 --> 00:11:58,514
Do you have enemies here
in the neighbourhood?

102
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,559
I don't know.
It was my fault that he was here.

103
00:12:01,684 --> 00:12:03,061
He came to see his mother...

104
00:13:08,001 --> 00:13:09,127
{\an8}IN DEFENCE
OF THE COLOMBIAN PEOPLE

105
00:13:09,836 --> 00:13:12,171
- What did you ask Santa for?
- A game.

106
00:13:12,297 --> 00:13:14,549
- Which one?
- The Joker game.

107
00:13:14,674 --> 00:13:16,634
You think he'll bring it to you?

108
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:17,969
Dad?

109
00:13:18,094 --> 00:13:21,055
Santa is going to bring me
the Joker game, right?

110
00:13:23,016 --> 00:13:25,685
Dad?

111
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:27,478
Pablo, my love?

112
00:13:29,063 --> 00:13:32,150
Of course, Santa will bring you
everything you want, like always.

113
00:13:32,275 --> 00:13:34,277
Christmas without Christ.

114
00:13:41,492 --> 00:13:44,579
I'm planning on going to the advent
service tomorrow with the kids.

115
00:13:44,704 --> 00:13:46,914
What? No.
No one should leave this house.

116
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,500
I'm sure the kids would love
to see the lights.

117
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,711
The children are staying here
and so are you.

118
00:13:51,836 --> 00:13:54,047
Remember the first time
you saw the fireworks?

119
00:13:54,172 --> 00:13:57,717
My love, can you tell your mother
she can't take the children to Medellin?

120
00:13:57,842 --> 00:14:00,094
Mama, it's best for us to stay here.

121
00:14:00,219 --> 00:14:02,263
It's been a month
since I've gone to church.

122
00:14:02,388 --> 00:14:05,308
I'm sure that God
can hear your prayers from here.

123
00:14:05,433 --> 00:14:06,559
Don Pablo.

124
00:14:14,942 --> 00:14:17,862
Boss, they killed three more of our men.

125
00:14:17,987 --> 00:14:20,740
They found Jairo dead next to the river.

126
00:14:23,368 --> 00:14:26,245
Look, it's the Baccarat Crystal.

127
00:14:27,205 --> 00:14:28,289
Thank you.

128
00:14:28,414 --> 00:14:32,460
- That's also Baccarat Crystal.
- Feel the weight. Look...

129
00:14:33,294 --> 00:14:37,382
You can feel it's Baccarat.
This is from the Lloredas, right?

130
00:14:37,507 --> 00:14:38,883
How's it going, my love?

131
00:14:39,008 --> 00:14:41,761
My love, look at what
the Lloredas brought.

132
00:14:41,886 --> 00:14:43,388
Look, there's two.

133
00:14:44,263 --> 00:14:47,141
The Lloredas always treat us well...

134
00:14:48,768 --> 00:14:51,979
NEW DEATH SQUAD IN Medellin
"LOS PEPES"

135
00:14:53,272 --> 00:14:58,903
As gratifying as these displays may feel,
I'm not comfortable with these signs.

136
00:14:59,028 --> 00:15:02,323
They invite too much attention
and will lead to questions.

137
00:15:02,448 --> 00:15:07,078
Our objective is to eliminate Escobar
as efficiently and discreetly as possible.

138
00:15:07,203 --> 00:15:08,704
Without a doubt.

139
00:15:16,587 --> 00:15:19,882
No more proclamations or manifestos
or letters to the media.

140
00:15:20,007 --> 00:15:22,176
What about Miami?

141
00:15:24,345 --> 00:15:26,597
We buy time.

142
00:15:26,722 --> 00:15:29,350
Let him think he still has control.

143
00:15:30,101 --> 00:15:31,978
Until the moment we take it from him.

144
00:15:38,734 --> 00:15:41,571
- New intel from the embassy.
- Thank you.

145
00:16:18,107 --> 00:16:21,319
<i>- What do you have for me, Peña?</i>
- I got something new.

146
00:16:22,111 --> 00:16:25,865
- <i>Blackie.</i>
- I like the way this is going, Javier.

147
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:29,827
He's got a girlfriend. She's pregnant,
keeps calling. They're vetting it now.

148
00:16:29,952 --> 00:16:33,623
It'll take a while.
Blackie's going to show.

149
00:16:33,748 --> 00:16:35,416
<i>It's done.</i>

150
00:17:37,061 --> 00:17:39,855
Almighty Holy Child of Atocha.
Carmelita, help me please.

151
00:17:39,981 --> 00:17:41,482
Don't fight with me anymore.

152
00:17:41,607 --> 00:17:45,027
I'm going to tell you two things:
First, relax.

153
00:17:45,152 --> 00:17:47,029
That's harmful for you and the baby.

154
00:17:47,154 --> 00:17:50,491
Second, for the love of God,
take the money.

155
00:17:50,616 --> 00:17:51,867
I'll find more later.

156
00:17:51,993 --> 00:17:55,246
It's not for you or me, it's for the baby,
please understand.

157
00:17:55,371 --> 00:17:58,249
Try to understand me.
I don't want your money.

158
00:17:58,374 --> 00:18:00,626
I want you to be with me
and the baby, that's it.

159
00:18:00,751 --> 00:18:04,589
Stop being stupid, girl.
We need that money.

160
00:18:04,714 --> 00:18:07,174
- Listen to your dad.
- I don't know what's wrong with this girl.

161
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,135
She's stubborn.

162
00:18:42,376 --> 00:18:44,211
Post three is in position.

163
00:18:44,337 --> 00:18:47,798
<i>Yes, sir, we'll be there in five minutes.</i>

164
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,061
<i>Wait, Javier.</i>

165
00:19:13,449 --> 00:19:17,536
Talk to me.
We're just getting here.

166
00:19:17,662 --> 00:19:19,330
Copy that, we're leaving now.

167
00:19:19,455 --> 00:19:21,749
It was Berna.
The streets are full of Search Bloc.

168
00:19:21,874 --> 00:19:25,378
All right, boys, the hunt is over for now.
Let's get out of here.

169
00:19:31,384 --> 00:19:33,177
- What's going on?
- Nothing, sir.

170
00:19:33,302 --> 00:19:36,972
We're conducting a police operation.
All good?

171
00:19:38,808 --> 00:19:40,017
Let him through.

172
00:19:43,646 --> 00:19:48,943
Keep calm, guys.
Hide your weapons while we handle this.

173
00:19:49,068 --> 00:19:50,695
Let him through.

174
00:19:59,912 --> 00:20:01,914
Good evening, what can I do for you?

175
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:06,919
Good afternoon, gentleman.
I need to see some form of ID, please.

176
00:20:07,044 --> 00:20:08,838
Of course, with pleasure.

177
00:20:11,757 --> 00:20:13,467
How's this for an ID?

178
00:20:21,976 --> 00:20:26,063
Get out of the car and put your hands
where I can see them.

179
00:20:26,772 --> 00:20:28,107
Quickly.

180
00:20:30,568 --> 00:20:31,736
Boy, come over here.

181
00:20:31,861 --> 00:20:36,407
- Colonel. Situation at checkpoint 20.
- What's going on?

182
00:20:36,532 --> 00:20:38,617
- Armed men attempting to pass through.
- Checkpoint 20?

183
00:20:38,743 --> 00:20:39,910
That's correct, sir.

184
00:20:42,204 --> 00:20:44,749
- All units move to position 20.
- Understood.

185
00:20:44,874 --> 00:20:47,042
All units to position 20.

186
00:20:55,926 --> 00:20:58,929
My love, you have to take the money.

187
00:20:59,054 --> 00:21:01,807
Blackie! Blackie. The cops are here.

188
00:21:01,932 --> 00:21:04,977
Take care of the baby!
Take care, Carmelita!

189
00:21:05,853 --> 00:21:10,483
We're both on the same team here.
What's the problem?

190
00:21:11,358 --> 00:21:15,362
Stay where you are!
Hands where I can see them.

191
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,284
Relax, relax.

192
00:21:22,036 --> 00:21:23,579
Want to see my ID?

193
00:21:25,122 --> 00:21:26,540
Take it out slowly.

194
00:21:38,511 --> 00:21:41,639
You point a gun at me, motherfucker?

195
00:21:41,764 --> 00:21:43,682
Do me a favour.

196
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:47,561
Move those cars because we're
not playing cops and robbers here.

197
00:21:53,192 --> 00:21:56,529
Relax!

198
00:21:56,654 --> 00:21:58,405
Disarm!

199
00:21:59,031 --> 00:22:01,033
- No, you disarm.
- Sir.

200
00:22:01,158 --> 00:22:03,327
Lower your firearm.

201
00:22:05,871 --> 00:22:07,748
Easy!

202
00:22:07,873 --> 00:22:10,543
OK, tough guys. Bravo!

203
00:22:11,544 --> 00:22:12,711
Bravo!

204
00:22:13,462 --> 00:22:17,132
Bravo, yes, we know it.
We all want Escobar.

205
00:22:17,258 --> 00:22:19,301
But let us do the fucking job.

206
00:22:21,095 --> 00:22:24,265
What? You want to kill each other
at a checkpoint?

207
00:22:26,267 --> 00:22:27,935
Lower your weapon. Lower it.

208
00:22:29,854 --> 00:22:31,272
Lower it.

209
00:22:38,487 --> 00:22:41,782
OK. These dreamers
think they're helping.

210
00:22:42,783 --> 00:22:45,286
- Are you OK? Yeah? Everything OK?
- Yes, sir.

211
00:22:45,411 --> 00:22:49,081
OK. Let's go home alive.

212
00:22:49,206 --> 00:22:51,000
- OK?
- OK.

213
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:52,459
- Let them pass.
- OK.

214
00:22:55,045 --> 00:22:57,548
Well then, thank you.

215
00:23:19,445 --> 00:23:22,907
- What happened? Everything OK? Yes?
- Yes, sir.

216
00:23:23,032 --> 00:23:25,117
Miss, we need your cooperation.

217
00:23:25,826 --> 00:23:28,203
Tell us where Blackie is.
Where do we find him?

218
00:23:28,329 --> 00:23:29,997
I told you.
I haven't seen him.

219
00:23:30,122 --> 00:23:32,291
Don't be afraid.
We don't want you.

220
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:35,210
We want your boyfriend, Blackie.

221
00:23:36,128 --> 00:23:38,839
Sir, I told you,
I don't know where he's at.

222
00:23:38,964 --> 00:23:41,383
That bastard has not come around
in a long time.

223
00:23:41,508 --> 00:23:44,887
If you want, let's go to the station.
But I told you, I don't know where he is.

224
00:23:45,012 --> 00:23:46,722
So please leave my house.

225
00:23:47,306 --> 00:23:49,934
They were eight, maybe ten.

226
00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:54,355
How did they take your firearm?

227
00:23:57,858 --> 00:24:01,570
I don't know, he just took it. Sorry.

228
00:24:03,656 --> 00:24:08,202
Next time, might as well
put the gun to your own head.

229
00:24:08,327 --> 00:24:09,578
It's easier.

230
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:30,617
Mr President, these men, the Castaños,

231
00:25:30,743 --> 00:25:34,038
I've seen their tactics firsthand
in the jungle against the FARC.

232
00:25:34,163 --> 00:25:39,001
<i>Their method of war is murder.
I think this is only the beginning.</i>

233
00:25:39,126 --> 00:25:41,712
<i>And it will get even worse.</i>

234
00:25:41,837 --> 00:25:44,423
<i>Colonel, I understand your concern.</i>

235
00:25:44,548 --> 00:25:48,135
It's strange. They usually operate
against the guerrillas

236
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:51,764
but now they're operating
against the narcos.

237
00:25:51,889 --> 00:25:55,392
Hugo, my cabinet is still evaluating
the best course of action

238
00:25:55,517 --> 00:25:57,102
with regard to Los PEPES.

239
00:25:57,227 --> 00:26:03,525
Sir, I'd like your permission
to engage them.

240
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:08,906
No. The greatest service we can do
for this nation is capture Escobar.

241
00:26:09,031 --> 00:26:11,325
That's what we must focus on, Colonel.

242
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:13,452
<i>It's our priority.</i>

243
00:26:13,577 --> 00:26:17,081
I understand. Thank you, sir.

244
00:26:46,819 --> 00:26:49,071
Let's take a look at this injury.

245
00:26:54,284 --> 00:26:55,661
Very good.

246
00:27:03,043 --> 00:27:06,964
This is going to hurt.
Tell me who you work for.

247
00:27:07,923 --> 00:27:10,008
The Castaños.

248
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,055
The Castaños.

249
00:27:17,057 --> 00:27:20,769
What could have brought them
out of the jungle?

250
00:27:24,106 --> 00:27:25,941
I say it was money.

251
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:30,195
More money
than Judy Moncada can find.

252
00:27:34,992 --> 00:27:37,995
Now is not the time
to take on more problems, brother.

253
00:27:42,249 --> 00:27:45,169
The Cali cartel thinks
they're immune to attack.

254
00:27:45,294 --> 00:27:47,629
This can't go unanswered.

255
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:50,132
Go.

256
00:28:10,694 --> 00:28:12,821
Carlos, you scared me.

257
00:28:26,335 --> 00:28:29,504
Tata, you have to do it now.
Pablo's gone mad.

258
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:32,424
With everything he's planning,
there will be consequences.

259
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:34,593
You and the kids
need to separate from him.

260
00:28:34,718 --> 00:28:36,470
No, Carlos.

261
00:28:40,015 --> 00:28:42,142
Tata, my God, listen to me.

262
00:28:42,267 --> 00:28:45,103
There's a fearlessness to Los PEPES
that I've never seen.

263
00:28:45,229 --> 00:28:48,232
The public declarations,
the open displays.

264
00:28:48,357 --> 00:28:50,776
They won't stop until he's dead.

265
00:28:50,901 --> 00:28:54,780
I know that, Carlos.
I've known for a long time now.

266
00:28:55,739 --> 00:28:58,033
You know what's the only thought
on my mind?

267
00:28:58,951 --> 00:29:00,702
That this is the last time...

268
00:29:01,453 --> 00:29:04,706
the last time
I'll look at my husband's face.

269
00:29:04,831 --> 00:29:08,043
The last time
I'll feel his arms around me.

270
00:29:08,168 --> 00:29:11,463
The last time I'll see him play
with our children.

271
00:29:11,588 --> 00:29:15,050
I automatically push that idea
out of my mind.

272
00:29:15,175 --> 00:29:16,927
And now?

273
00:29:20,347 --> 00:29:23,433
Now I know, Carlos,
that wherever I go...

274
00:29:24,351 --> 00:29:26,728
I'll always be Pablo Escobar's wife.

275
00:29:26,853 --> 00:29:30,774
My children will always
be Pablo Escobar's children.

276
00:29:31,441 --> 00:29:33,944
Even if we lived in exile
with him.

277
00:29:35,654 --> 00:29:37,239
But without him?

278
00:29:39,574 --> 00:29:40,742
No.

279
00:29:43,912 --> 00:29:46,373
OK.

280
00:29:46,498 --> 00:29:48,125
Let's do something.

281
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:52,296
If we talk to him,
maybe he'll reconsider leaving with us.

282
00:29:54,881 --> 00:29:56,800
I've had a good life.

283
00:29:58,010 --> 00:30:00,971
Did you ever imagine
we'd have all this?

284
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:22,326
When my niece was growing up,
she didn't think this day would come.

285
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:25,203
She was so skinny.

286
00:30:25,329 --> 00:30:28,790
- She wore glasses and had braces.
- Yes.

287
00:30:28,915 --> 00:30:33,045
When she was 12,
she thought her life was over.

288
00:30:34,046 --> 00:30:37,507
I told her to wait and be patient.

289
00:30:37,632 --> 00:30:42,095
Someday her beauty on the outside
would match her beauty within.

290
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:45,807
You have never looked more beautiful
than you do tonight.

291
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:49,144
Cheers to the family.

292
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:53,148
To Marta and Diego! Cheers!

293
00:31:54,668 --> 00:31:55,836
Wait!

294
00:31:56,628 --> 00:31:58,630
Wait!

295
00:32:15,856 --> 00:32:20,652
Ma! Papa! Papa!

296
00:32:22,904 --> 00:32:25,073
- I'm here, my love.
- Mum!

297
00:32:38,837 --> 00:32:40,255
That man...

298
00:32:43,592 --> 00:32:46,845
has no decency.

299
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:54,853
To attack my family like this...

300
00:32:57,189 --> 00:32:59,232
my daughter...

301
00:33:00,192 --> 00:33:02,527
on the night of her wedding...

302
00:33:05,363 --> 00:33:07,866
Only a madman would do that.

303
00:33:10,243 --> 00:33:14,247
A crazed animal, dangerous.

304
00:33:18,335 --> 00:33:19,503
I want him dead.

305
00:33:20,504 --> 00:33:22,547
Not next year. Right now.

306
00:33:23,507 --> 00:33:25,217
Kill all of them.

307
00:33:25,342 --> 00:33:29,930
I don't just want you to kill his lawyers,
accountants and bankers...

308
00:33:30,055 --> 00:33:33,058
I want you to kill his secretaries...

309
00:33:34,351 --> 00:33:38,939
anyone who lifted a finger
to help that man.

310
00:33:39,064 --> 00:33:40,899
I want to see them dead.

311
00:33:41,608 --> 00:33:44,486
Anyone who has ever licked
a postage stamp

312
00:33:44,611 --> 00:33:46,238
and put it on an envelope
in his name,

313
00:33:46,363 --> 00:33:48,448
I want to see them dead.

314
00:33:48,573 --> 00:33:54,496
And then I want you to find anyone who
ever shook his hand and kill them too!

315
00:33:57,582 --> 00:33:59,584
That son of a bitch.

316
00:34:03,463 --> 00:34:07,634
From this night, we'll show no mercy.

317
00:34:18,728 --> 00:34:20,063
<i>Gilberto?</i>

318
00:34:20,188 --> 00:34:23,483
Gilberto, Miguel
and Pacho survived, boss.

319
00:34:23,608 --> 00:34:25,902
That'll be all, Quica.

320
00:34:26,027 --> 00:34:27,279
Thank you, boss.

321
00:34:36,162 --> 00:34:37,247
Pablo?

322
00:34:39,874 --> 00:34:41,876
I'm worried about Tata.

323
00:34:43,378 --> 00:34:45,589
I think you should let her travel.
She'll be safer.

324
00:34:45,714 --> 00:34:48,800
What you're doing will have
consequences.

325
00:34:50,051 --> 00:34:52,554
That's why they're here. Right?

326
00:34:53,513 --> 00:34:55,890
That's why they're here with me,
to be safe.

327
00:34:56,016 --> 00:34:58,893
- Cali is going to want payback for...
- I know...

328
00:34:59,686 --> 00:35:02,355
who my enemies are, Carlos.

329
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:06,234
And I can fight them all.

330
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:07,611
I know that.

331
00:35:08,278 --> 00:35:10,864
But if Tata and the children
are out of the country,

332
00:35:10,989 --> 00:35:13,033
you'd be free to wage this war
with no holds barred.

333
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,997
Let me ask you something.

334
00:35:29,633 --> 00:35:31,343
Why are you here?

335
00:35:31,468 --> 00:35:32,844
For Tata.

336
00:35:34,554 --> 00:35:35,639
Right?

337
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:40,352
To make her happier.

338
00:35:41,227 --> 00:35:46,566
To help her be more comfortable
with the life we're being forced to lead.

339
00:35:49,903 --> 00:35:51,446
Have you done that?

340
00:35:52,864 --> 00:35:56,117
Pablo, my sister is terrified.
And you can't see that...

341
00:35:56,242 --> 00:36:02,415
Your sister is a lot tougher
than you think.

342
00:36:04,042 --> 00:36:08,004
My wife... and my children...

343
00:36:08,713 --> 00:36:10,715
stay with me.

344
00:36:28,483 --> 00:36:29,484
Hello.

345
00:37:35,925 --> 00:37:37,010
Ma'am?

346
00:37:38,219 --> 00:37:40,013
Take me to Mass.

347
00:37:40,889 --> 00:37:44,559
- But the boss said we couldn't.
- Pablo worries too much.

348
00:37:44,684 --> 00:37:46,478
Besides, you work for me.

349
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:56,988
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

350
00:37:57,113 --> 00:38:03,870
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on earth, as it is in heaven.

351
00:38:03,995 --> 00:38:09,417
Give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses

352
00:38:09,542 --> 00:38:13,505
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

353
00:38:35,193 --> 00:38:41,616
It's shameful for the country to stand by
while a group of mercenaries

354
00:38:41,741 --> 00:38:45,912
distributes its version
of perverse justice.

355
00:38:46,913 --> 00:38:49,082
It makes all of us look bad.

356
00:38:49,207 --> 00:38:53,294
- Including the president.
- Especially the president.

357
00:38:53,419 --> 00:38:57,715
If he continues to allow Los PEPES
to do the dirty work,

358
00:38:57,841 --> 00:38:59,425
which is his responsibility...

359
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:05,598
Colombia will never forgive him.

360
00:39:21,281 --> 00:39:24,242
MERRY CHRISTMAS

361
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:23,523
Where were you?

362
00:43:24,232 --> 00:43:26,859
- I went to church.
- I told you it wasn't safe.

363
00:43:26,984 --> 00:43:30,321
And I told you that it would be fine.
And look, everything's fine.

364
00:43:30,446 --> 00:43:32,657
How could you put
the children's lives at risk?

365
00:43:32,782 --> 00:43:34,826
No one here is in danger.

366
00:43:34,951 --> 00:43:39,205
I'm surprised at you, Pablo. This one
has always been nervous, but you?

367
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:40,915
Don't talk that way to my husband.

368
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:46,629
I can talk to him however I want.
I don't know why everyone is...

369
00:43:55,471 --> 00:43:58,266
Take Tata and the kids!
You, cover my mother!

370
00:44:08,151 --> 00:44:09,277
Juan Pablo! Juan Pablo!

371
00:44:09,402 --> 00:44:11,863
Put your coat on, quick!
Put your coat on.

372
00:44:11,988 --> 00:44:14,532
Come here, Manuela.
Let's go, Pablo!

373
00:44:14,657 --> 00:44:18,369
This way! Run!

374
00:44:19,078 --> 00:44:21,414
Run quickly!

375
00:44:23,332 --> 00:44:24,667
Pablo!

376
00:44:27,044 --> 00:44:29,463
Get out!

377
00:44:29,589 --> 00:44:31,465
Carlos, let's go!

378
00:44:32,466 --> 00:44:34,552
Run, Limón, run!

379
00:44:34,677 --> 00:44:36,679
Let's go! Outside!

380
00:44:36,804 --> 00:44:40,141
- Come on, Tata, come on.
- Get him in the car. Get him inside!

381
00:44:40,266 --> 00:44:43,769
- Quickly! Let's go!
- Quickly!

382
00:44:43,895 --> 00:44:45,146
Give me the girl.

383
00:44:45,271 --> 00:44:47,106
Get in, Tata, get in.

384
00:44:48,107 --> 00:44:50,151
Come on, brother. Go!
Cover that side!

385
00:44:50,276 --> 00:44:51,485
Move!

386
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:57,885
They're in the house!
Let's go! Let's go!

387
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:03,349
- Calm down.
- Don't let her move.

388
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:05,977
Come on, boss! Let's go.

389
00:46:09,647 --> 00:46:11,482
- No!
- Pablo!

390
00:46:12,608 --> 00:46:14,735
Come on!

391
00:46:15,736 --> 00:46:17,863
Boss, come on!

392
00:46:17,989 --> 00:46:20,032
Let's go, boss!

393
00:46:22,326 --> 00:46:23,452
Come on!

394
00:46:24,787 --> 00:46:26,289
Let's go!

395
00:47:29,685 --> 00:47:31,187
Los PEPES...

396
00:47:34,148 --> 00:47:36,734
the Cali cartel, Judy Moncada,

397
00:47:36,859 --> 00:47:40,654
the Castaños, the government,
the gringos.

398
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:43,532
Let the bastards come.

399
00:47:43,657 --> 00:47:47,953
We'll be ready for a war,
a fucking bloodbath.

400
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:52,750
We will fight like we have never
fought before in our lives.

401
00:47:54,001 --> 00:47:55,294
Yes, boss.

402
00:47:55,795 --> 00:47:58,798
Go for food and you go for firewood.

403
00:48:01,342 --> 00:48:07,348
Whoever did this
will never get near us ever again.

404
00:48:11,727 --> 00:48:13,729
I promise you.

405
00:48:20,986 --> 00:48:25,449
Daddy, how will Santa
know how to find us?

406
00:48:36,335 --> 00:48:37,837
Santa...

407
00:48:40,673 --> 00:48:46,720
Santa will always find
your good and kind heart.

408
00:48:48,597 --> 00:48:51,475
Wherever you are in this world.

409
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:56,939
Boss? The wood is all wet.
There's no way to light it up.

410
00:49:07,074 --> 00:49:10,161
Go to Envigado for food and wood.

411
00:49:10,286 --> 00:49:13,664
- Right away, boss.
- Be careful not to be seen.

412
00:49:13,789 --> 00:49:14,915
Got it.

413
00:49:19,753 --> 00:49:21,797
This is all I could find, boss.

414
00:49:22,882 --> 00:49:24,383
How do you open that shit?

415
00:49:24,508 --> 00:49:26,218
I'll go look, boss.

416
00:49:43,402 --> 00:49:44,737
This just came in.

417
00:49:50,034 --> 00:49:52,119
Shit's getting real, Peña.

418
00:50:46,966 --> 00:50:49,843
Mummy, I'm cold.

419
00:50:52,721 --> 00:50:54,223
She's freezing.

420
00:51:00,896 --> 00:51:02,231
Put this on.

421
00:51:37,141 --> 00:51:42,062
You and the children...
need to leave Colombia.

422
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:50,738
When you're safe,
I'll be free to do what's best for us.

423
00:51:59,997 --> 00:52:01,957
It won't be long.

424
00:52:05,586 --> 00:52:08,255
Soon we'll be together again.

425
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,261
Forever.
