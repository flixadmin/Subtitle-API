1
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,760
Dang it.

2
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,480
Dang it.

3
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,240
Man, some days

4
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,280
rewriting history to eradicate
any notion of rebellion

5
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,080
and free will is hard.

6
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,400
Yeah.

7
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,480
You ever wondered
if what we're doing is, like, wrong?

8
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,760
How could it be wrong?

9
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,000
The Fates give everyone food,
and shelter, and television.

10
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,960
You don't want a world that looks
like these history books, do you?

11
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,360
Right. Right, the Fates be praised.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,760
Just doesn't feel quite right.

13
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,480
<i>Geoffrey Burch.</i>

14
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,080
<i>I am Atropos, the Thread Cutter.</i>

15
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,360
Atropos is calling you.

16
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,320
Great.

17
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,800
<i>Your time has come to an end.</i>

18
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,120
<i>Your thread is hereby cut.</i>

19
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,560
<i>It is fated.</i>

20
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,280
Oh, I see.

21
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,920
Well...

22
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,800
Fates be praised.

23
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,120
Sorry, Geoffrey.

24
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,880
<i>The work period has ended.</i>

25
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,840
<i>Return to your domiciles
for mandatory recreation period.</i>

26
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,200
<i>The Fates are always watching.</i>

27
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,000
<i>Relinquish free will.</i>

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,760
<i>The world is perfect.</i>

29
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,080
The world is wrong!

30
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,280
Can't you people see?

31
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,040
None of this is how it should be.

32
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,920
He's gonna get his dang thread cut.

33
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,360
Do I know you?

34
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,680
You look familiar.
Do you recognize me?

35
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,200
My name is Gary,
but most people call me "Crazy Guy."

36
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,280
Stay away from me, you weirdo.

37
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,920
Yeah, they call me that, too.

38
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,880
The world is wrong!

39
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,480
This is your new home, little guy.

40
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,560
Another night, another bowl of mush.

41
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,120
Let's see
what's streaming on Fate Plus.

42
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,600
I'm back.

43
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,400
Hey, Behrad.

44
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,360
{\an5}Did you remember
the gray mush like I asked?

45
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,600
I got the green mush,
the purple mush,

46
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:11,200
the sticky mush, the slimy mush
and I forgot the gray mush.

47
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,920
- You forgot the gray mush?
- I forgot the gray mush.

48
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,840
Behrad, you're so dumb.

49
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,160
<i>- They're the ultimate buds
- They're the ultimate buds</i>

50
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,040
<i>- And they're fated to have some fun
- And they're fated to have some fun</i>

51
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,560
Momma needs her Ultimate Buds.

52
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,440
{\an5}The oven's taking forever to preheat
and the mush is still cold.

53
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,080
{\an5}My boss is gonna be here
in 30 minutes.

54
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,720
Or maybe she'll be early.

55
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,520
- Nate!
- Nate.

56
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,920
I don't know this Nate you speak off.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,040
{\an5}Me name is Robin
of Loxley of Starling City.

58
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,560
Why?

59
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,520
{\an5}I got an audition
to play Robin Hood in <i>Arrow,</i>

60
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,480
a show about a vigilante.

61
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,760
Sounds dumb.

62
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,480
{\an5}If it was dumb,
why would I stop crime with this?

63
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,960
The gray mush.

64
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,760
I guess I got the gray mush.

65
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,120
<i>At least the family heirloom
didn't get dirty.</i>

66
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,440
I should go clean off.

67
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,440
No, no, no
don't leave me here with...

68
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,320
Nate.

69
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,920
{\an5}Are you still upset about the time
we almost kissed?

70
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,280
I'm sorry.

71
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,840
I'm sorry I missed the kiss.

72
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,720
No, I'm mad
because you ruined the place,

73
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,720
and my boss
is going to be here any minute.

74
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,880
What's that thing doing?

75
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,000
{\an5}I don't know.
It's never done that before.

76
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,320
I say don't touch it.

77
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:44,400
Right.

78
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,240
But on the other hand, why not?

79
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,040
{\an5}This show's off the rails.
There's no ghost in Ultimate Buds.

80
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,360
Nate?

81
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,600
Zari?

82
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,000
But how? You found me.

83
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,120
Oh, God.

84
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,960
- What was that?
- What?

85
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,120
Nate?

86
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,120
Yeah. Nate Heywood.
Actor and your neighbor.

87
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,280
Do you remember us?

88
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,480
I mean,
I always wanted there to be an "us."

89
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,440
Could I be more of a kiss misser?

90
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,640
Lot going on here.

91
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,520
Right, need to take
these off immediately.

92
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,720
{\an5}Right, I knew the timeline
would be different,

93
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,760
and you might not remember me
but this is just bizarre.

94
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,680
Right, where is the Waverider?

95
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,320
Where's Sara and Mick
and John and the others?

96
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,440
Ava Sharpe?

97
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,120
Mona Wu?

98
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,160
Did they just say "Mona Wu"?

99
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,920
Sure. Sure.
All good questions. Great.

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,480
Hey, Behrad, your sister
might've hit her head again.

101
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,760
Behrad?

102
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,320
Is that really you?

103
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,680
I thought I'd never see you again.

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,960
Did you eat an entire Behrad brownie?

105
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,920
- What?
- Your boss.

106
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,760
Why don't you just stay
in this closet for a sec,

107
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,040
while we entertain your boss?

108
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,160
And your liver processes the brownie.

109
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,400
Welcome. I am Behrad, Zari's brother.

110
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,760
You must be the hot boss.

111
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,720
My, what a charming brother
the Fates have granted Zari.

112
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,600
Where is she?

113
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,680
Not in the closet, that's for sure.

114
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,440
Okay. Boss coming over for dinner?

115
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,440
Think I know what's going on here.

116
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,840
We're stuck in a TV sitcom.

117
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:19,000
Zari, do you have amnesia again?

118
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,000
You guys don't hear that.
The laughing?

119
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,200
She's hearing voices.

120
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,280
Sis, what do you think is happening?

121
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,640
I think you guys fought the Fates.

122
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,720
Fates be praised.

123
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,160
And you lost.

124
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,760
And for some reason,
you've been loomed here.

125
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,080
What's behind this door?

126
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,920
I don't know. We never opened it.

127
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,320
Never even occurred to us.

128
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,880
Well, we're about to find out.

129
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,480
Has that been here the whole time?

130
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,120
Coming, dummies?

131
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,320
Buds stick together.

132
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,920
Like glue.

133
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,440
Where are we?

134
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,480
We've been expecting you.

135
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,000
Welcome to Highcastle Abbey.

136
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,840
Lady Zari and Lord Behrad,

137
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,240
the second footman
will see to your carriage.

138
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,360
What happened to the first footman?

139
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,680
I've taken the liberty
of ordering you

140
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,080
some Persian treats
to make you feel at home.

141
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,320
Shall I ask the kitchen
to prepare a tea?

142
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,440
Sure.

143
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,000
Unbelievable.

144
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,320
John Constantine,

145
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,120
self-proclaimed nasty piece
of work is a butler.

146
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,360
Please tell me
you guys recognize him.

147
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,360
- No. No.
- Sorry, sis.

148
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,000
- You think this is another TV show?
- Right.

149
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:24,000
We were from a hilarious
yet heartfelt sitcom,

150
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,520
but now, we're stuck
on some stuffy BBC period piece.

151
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,320
With no obvious way to escape.

152
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:43,080
Well, it seems like the TV show
is adapting to our presence.

153
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,400
So, I think we just have
to play along

154
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,240
until I can get John
to snap out of it.

155
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,600
Okay, it looks like
we're some kind of aristocrats.

156
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,680
Nice.

157
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,240
That must make you our servant.

158
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,360
Wouldn't you prefer
wearing something a tad

159
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,440
more cheerful, dearest?

160
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,800
I would, if the prospect
of your matchmaking

161
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,200
was worthy of cheer.

162
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,920
Lord Behrad
is your father's closest male heir.

163
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,840
A marriage to him keeps
Highcastle Abbey in our family.

164
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,720
Well, how is he, Mr. Constantine?

165
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,360
Lord Behrad is,
as advertised, a foreigner.

166
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,760
Not you, too.

167
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,240
Lord and Lady Tarazi,

168
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:35,320
may I present Lady Natalie
and her daughter, Lady Astra.

169
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,920
I do beg your pardon,
Lord Tarazi, but is it customary

170
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,120
where you come from
for the valet to sit?

171
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,760
A thousand apologies, bro.

172
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,080
Mr. Constantine,

173
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,160
why don't you show the Tarazis' valet
to the servant's hall?

174
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,560
Happily, my lady.

175
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,840
Please have a seat.

176
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,040
You must be exhausted
from your travels.

177
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,400
I'm so glad we could find the time
to get to know one another.

178
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,480
Yes.

179
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,000
Before we marry
and you inherit our family's estate.

180
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,880
I'm sorry, did you say "marry"?

181
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,960
I have to go to the bathroom.

182
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,200
To the lavatory.

183
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,360
Don't leave me.

184
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,440
Do you enjoy hunting, Lord Behrad?

185
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,440
I like to play among the animals,
not slaughter them.

186
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,320
Well, that is
an unconventional opinion.

187
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,360
In this household,

188
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,600
servants should be seen and not heard
in the company of their superiors.

189
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,440
Which means
we should all be silent around you.

190
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,840
Is that right, Mr. Constantine?

191
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,600
Mrs. Hutchins,
trying to hold your tongue

192
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,600
would be as easy as swimming
through custard in Wellington boots.

193
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,640
There you are, John.

194
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,240
I do beg your pardon, Lady Zari,
but this is most irregular.

195
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,000
Right, I need to talk to you.

196
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,760
Alone.

197
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,120
They got the blue mush.

198
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,680
- Fancy kind.
- Yum.

199
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,280
How may I assist you, my lady?

200
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,480
All right, listen to me.

201
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:19,640
You are not some buttoned-up butler.

202
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:23,880
You are a cynical, chain-smoking,
master of the occult.

203
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,320
You have an apprentice named Gary,
and you are capable of great...

204
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,240
Magic.

205
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,640
Did she just say "Gary" now?

206
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,080
Maybe that crazy guy
isn't so crazy after all.

207
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,640
Can I confide in you, Lord Behrad?

208
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,840
Confide away.

209
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,560
Sometimes, I wish
I'd been born a man.

210
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,000
At least then,
I'd have a chance at adventure.

211
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,040
Your parents can't hold you here.

212
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,360
You're a diva.

213
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,520
What is a diva?

214
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,520
A diva is a female version
of a hustler.

215
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,680
Okay, let me get this straight.

216
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,280
You don't remember me or the Legends,
but you can still cast spells?

217
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,640
To my great shame,
I am at war with myself.

218
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,720
Part of me is...

219
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,760
seduced by dark magic.

220
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,280
That's the real you.

221
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,680
Are you going to inform Lady Natalie?

222
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,760
Yeah, maybe we should.

223
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,480
Please, please don't. I beg you.

224
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,800
You see, I'd be sacked.

225
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,960
You know what?

226
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,240
If you cast one of your spells
and help us escape this world,

227
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,240
we will keep quiet.

228
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,160
- Maybe.
- We will.

229
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,800
Gary, I think people
are trapped on the TV,

230
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,000
and they know us.

231
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,440
You sound crazy.

232
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,520
You were onto something.

233
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,640
The world's all wrong
and the cracks are starting to show.

234
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,920
Just watch.

235
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,400
<i>In order for this spell
to work properly,</i>

236
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,080
<i>I must first know
where it is that you intend to go.</i>

237
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,560
Can you send us to someone?

238
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,560
We need to find our captain.

239
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,400
What is your captain's name?

240
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,440
Sara. Captain Sara Lance.

241
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,760
The Jack of Wands.

242
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,480
Daring exploits
and dangerous challenges lay ahead.

243
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,880
- Great.
- I do hope this works.

244
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,840
I shall be glad to be rid of you.

245
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,680
Actually, John,
we really need you to come with us.

246
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,160
Amusing joke, my lady,
but I will never desert my post.

247
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,200
I tried to stop her.

248
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,400
Mr. Constantine, I have made
the most wonderful decision.

249
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,360
I'm moving to London.

250
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,560
London?

251
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,040
What about Highcastle?
And your mother?

252
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,040
I am a diva.

253
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,160
My bad.

254
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,920
Everyone who wants to leave, link up.

255
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,480
Where are we going?

256
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,320
Lady Astra, I beg you,
please step away.

257
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,760
To live a life that I love,

258
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,480
I must know the world
outside these walls.

259
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,440
Lady Astra, I must insist.

260
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,400
Where did they go?

261
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,440
Did she say "Captain Lance"?

262
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,040
From Star Trip?

263
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,760
We have to get
into Clotho Productions

264
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,560
and find out what's going on.

265
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,400
Officer Maala, report.

266
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,880
It's a Gromulan Warship, Captains.

267
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,040
Hail them, Officer Maala.

268
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,840
Or wouldn't it be more logical
to attack the warship

269
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,800
before it attacks us?

270
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,920
By that logic, we would attack
every ship we encountered.

271
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,640
Is there something wrong with that?

272
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,360
Fine, Officer Maala.
Hail the Gromulans.

273
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,440
Yes, Captain.

274
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,880
Can we kill them now?

275
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,480
<i>Space, the fatal frontier.</i>

276
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:10,760
<i>These are the adventures
of the USS Faterider.</i>

277
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,960
<i>Its mission,</i>

278
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,960
<i>to seek out rebellious lifeforms
and disobedient civilizations.</i>

279
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,840
<i>And blow them up with lasers.</i>

280
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,000
Captains, we've caught the Gromulans
with their pants down.

281
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,640
Charge the cannons.

282
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,160
Let's give them hell.

283
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,240
Engage the translator, Officer Maala.

284
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,920
I would like to talk to them.

285
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,840
Two captains
is an exciting power dynamic.

286
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,120
Charging cannons
and engaging the translator.

287
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,440
<i>Okay, sorry,
do you guys not understand me?</i>

288
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,880
We understand you.

289
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,680
We come in peace.

290
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,000
Yeah, now, prepare to die.

291
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,960
<i>Wait, hold on, don't shoot. Listen.</i>

292
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,600
<i>None of this is real,
this is a fake reality.</i>

293
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,920
<i>Yeah, it's true,
we're all on television.</i>

294
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,400
Watch, I can press
this plasma cannon button,

295
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,480
and nothing's gonna happen.

296
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,400
No, no, no Nate. No. No.

297
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,600
On the other hand, why not?

298
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,360
Oh, God.

299
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,360
Who knew?

300
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,440
That was bad.

301
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,400
Can't even look.

302
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,720
Well, I mean, it's an absolutely
remarkable vessel really, isn't it?

303
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:37,000
Officer Maala!

304
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,840
The crew has perished.

305
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,320
No!

306
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,200
There's no need to vocalize
at that decibel.

307
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,400
They're androids.

308
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,120
Right.

309
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,360
This battle isn't over yet.

310
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,640
Crazy episode.

311
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,880
Excuse me, my good sir.

312
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:06,920
My colleague and I are here
to refill your mush vending machines.

313
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,200
I don't have you on my list.

314
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,040
Lalo, is it?

315
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,640
You don't want
to be known as the guy

316
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,160
who lets the building
run out of mush.

317
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,200
Do ya?

318
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,440
All right, go in.

319
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,640
Fire laser blasters.

320
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,840
Permanently disabled.

321
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,480
Photon torpedoes.

322
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,560
Destroyed.

323
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,960
<i>Hey, ladies,
permission to rescue you?</i>

324
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,160
<i>We can just beam you right over here.</i>

325
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,080
Smells like a Gromulan trap.

326
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,080
Okay, you're losing oxygen.
We're going to rescue you.

327
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,200
We're taking over this ship.

328
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,880
Sure, that works.
We're your crew, anyways.

329
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,240
I know it's complicated,

330
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,960
but we're actually
from an alternate timeline

331
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,520
where you're our captains.

332
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,000
You are our crew.

333
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,360
May I interest you
in some rare Gromulan tea?

334
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,800
It is grand to see
lady adventurers in pantaloons.

335
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,200
What kind of Gromulans are you?

336
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,520
- Ultimate Buds.
- Ultimate Buds.

337
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,480
All right, I know
it's hard to believe, but...

338
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,520
No. It makes perfect sense.

339
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,880
We encounter
this sort of thing all the time.

340
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:28,000
You're probably our crew
from an alternate timeline

341
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,120
and you've been trapped
in some sort of...

342
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,120
judging by your mannerisms,

343
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,640
late and early 20th century
prison dimension,

344
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,600
which calls the question

345
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,840
if we ourselves
are existing in a prison dimension.

346
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,040
It's perfectly logical.

347
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,360
Ava, I love you.

348
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,240
Clotho's control room.

349
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,680
Look, that contraption's
spitting out a script for Star Trip.

350
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,640
It looks like
it's being generated automatically

351
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,880
by some sort
of script-writing algorithm.

352
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,880
What are these?

353
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,800
Those are life threads, Gary.

354
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,480
Someone really
is trapped in these shows.

355
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,680
Oh, my Fates.

356
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,960
What is it?

357
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,840
Ultimate Buds swag.

358
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,360
We need to figure out our next move.

359
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,240
What we need
is to get out of this TV show...

360
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,800
Prison dimension.

361
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,440
We've been investigating
an odd radio wave transmission,

362
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,360
coming from the planet Kul-de-sax.

363
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:37,560
<i>Welcome to my cul-de-sac, friend</i>

364
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,680
<i>That's a street that ends in a circle</i>

365
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,720
Is that a song?

366
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,680
We don't know what to make of it.

367
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,840
This sector should be deserted.

368
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:50,280
Right. I'm going to make contact.

369
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,080
With alien beings? Are you mad?

370
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,880
Absolutely do not make contact.

371
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,760
Even I think it's a bad idea.

372
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,240
Okay, okay I won't.

373
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,880
On the other hand...

374
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,960
Why not?

375
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,800
<i>Welcome to my cul-de-sac, friend</i>

376
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,160
<i>That's a street that ends in a circle</i>

377
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:24,280
Children, I think the Fates
have sent us some visitors.

378
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,040
Let's be good hosts.

379
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,200
I'll get the door.

380
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,000
Look who it is, everyone.
It's the community helpers.

381
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,160
We're on Mister Parker's Cul De Sac.

382
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,280
Sewer repair?

383
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,160
That's actually kind of badass.

384
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,960
Could there be such a profession
as a firewoman?

385
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,840
Gather around, friends.

386
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,280
It's story time.

387
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,000
Why don't you take
a walk around the block?

388
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,800
Actually, Officer Lance,
it is a cul-de-sac.

389
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,800
The logic of this world
does not compute.

390
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,000
What exactly is the plan, Dr. Zari?

391
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,200
I have no idea.

392
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,800
We just can't keep hopping shows
ad infinitum now, can we?

393
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,880
We are on public access.
This is a career-killer.

394
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,520
Yeah, come on, sis. What gives?

395
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,120
Look, I don't know.

396
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,400
If you guys would just remember
who you really are,

397
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,120
you could help me
figure this out, but...

398
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,040
None of you remember.

399
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,320
Remember what?

400
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,280
That you're the Legends.

401
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,080
What is a Legend?

402
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,120
What is a Legend?

403
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,800
You guys were heroes.

404
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,400
But it's not because you do magic

405
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,080
or because
you have superpowers, it...

406
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,040
What makes you guys special,

407
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,240
what makes us special is that
we're just a bunch of...

408
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,360
misfits who are trying
to make a difference.

409
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,960
<i>That is what we need right now.</i>

410
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:55,080
She's talking about us.

411
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,280
We can be those misfits, Gary.

412
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,640
But how?

413
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,880
I've been sanitizing history
for too long.

414
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,560
It's time to spread the truth.

415
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:09,720
The Legends remember
who they truly are.

416
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,600
<i>I wanna do right by Astra.</i>

417
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,240
<i>Make sure she was happy
growing up in a big house</i>

418
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,360
<i>and I could keep an eye on her.</i>

419
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,760
<i>Your mom never gave up on you.</i>

420
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,200
<i>You can really bring her back?</i>

421
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,040
<i>I can fix everything.</i>

422
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,120
<i>You don't belong here.</i>

423
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,560
<i>As far as I'm concerned,
we are co-captains for life.</i>

424
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,680
<i>Always.</i>

425
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,160
<i>Sara!</i>

426
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,160
<i>We changed history,
we changed everything.</i>

427
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,600
Dude, you just came back to life.

428
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,080
<i>I know that I love you.</i>

429
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Find me.

430
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,120
I remember everything.

431
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,840
I remember the Legends,
I remember our time with Behrad.

432
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,200
I remember both Zaris.

433
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,600
It's nice to be remembered.

434
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,200
Behrad.

435
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,440
I... I should be dead.

436
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,280
In every timeline
I shouldn't be alive.

437
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,600
Yeah, but you're alive here.
Okay, now.

438
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,320
Look, I actually think
I know what happened.

439
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,200
Look, I told Charlie to come up
with a way to outsmart her sisters.

440
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,280
Maybe hiding us on TV was that way.

441
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,880
Bloody Charlie.

442
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,360
A butler.

443
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,200
I feel violated.

444
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,200
What the hell, John?

445
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,800
Did the Loom
bring my mom back, or not?

446
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,880
I'm sorry, love, I don't know.

447
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,080
Hey.

448
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,160
Hi.

449
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,680
You found me.

450
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,640
I'm never gonna lose you again.

451
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,720
We did it, Gary.

452
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,000
You idiots.

453
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,160
Great Clotho. Praise the Fates.

454
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,960
What have you done?

455
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,000
We restored their memories.

456
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,640
Please don't kill us.

457
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,560
You're gonna ruin everything.

458
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,680
If only we could explain.

459
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,360
Silence!

460
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,720
I can't let the Legends escape.

461
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,080
Guys, love that you're back together.

462
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,280
And let's just say
that I'm processing

463
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,120
what it means that my best bro
is in love with my sister,

464
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,040
who lived my same experiences
in a different timeline.

465
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,280
But where's my Zari?

466
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,120
You took the words
right outta my mouth, mate.

467
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,360
Well, I'm sort
of possessing her body.

468
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,840
I mean, I love both of you.

469
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,600
- It's just...
- I get it.

470
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,800
She belongs here.

471
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,240
Yeah, but what happens to you?

472
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,200
Did someone say "problem"?

473
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,000
It sounds like being stuck
in a TV universe,

474
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,320
and suddenly remembering
two different timelines

475
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,240
is very confusing.

476
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,360
Maybe I can try to help.

477
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,800
I hate to question a living God,
but why are you doing this, Clotho?

478
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,280
Because the Legends
don't realize that

479
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,600
there are consequences
to disobedience.

480
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,640
"I know all about sad feelings."

481
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,920
I know all about sad feelings.

482
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,680
<i>Sad feelings</i>

483
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,080
<i>Bad feelings</i>

484
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,400
<i>Make you so mad</i>

485
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,120
<i>You wanna scream feelings</i>

486
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,000
<i>Everyone sometimes has those feelings</i>

487
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,920
<i>When you do just sing this song</i>

488
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,680
Mr. Parker I know you're trying
to help, but you just...

489
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:53,640
<i>Repress, repress</i>

490
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,640
<i>I'll go back and repress</i>

491
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:59,760
<i>It's better to bury my feelings</i>

492
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:05,880
<i>Than feel as awful as this</i>

493
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,640
Yeah, you're definitely
not Mr. Parker.

494
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,840
Where did you send them?

495
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,920
I just pulled the plug
on this crossover, silly.

496
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,880
You all have to go home now.

497
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,800
<i>Sad feelings</i>

498
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,320
<i>Bad feelings</i>

499
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,200
<i>Make you so mad
You wanna scream feelings</i>

500
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,880
<i>Everyone sometimes has those feelings</i>

501
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,720
<i>When you do just sing this song</i>

502
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,000
<i>Ignore, ignore</i>

503
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,120
<i>Those pesky feelings are a chore</i>

504
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,920
<i>Obey the Fates</i>

505
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,280
<i>Eat your mush</i>

506
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,920
<i>And you'll be happy</i>

507
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,200
<i>Just like two ladybugs</i>

508
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,480
Not today, Satan!

509
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,640
I am so sorry.
I thought I was tackling Mr. Parker.

510
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,720
What kind of mush
are we having tonight?

511
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:12,240
The "you gotta go" kind, come on.

512
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,160
Yeah, how did
we not hear that before?

513
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,000
After all that,
we're right back where we started.

514
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,040
Motherfater.
I wanna see the Buds break free.

515
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:27,000
Just try and make a move on us,
and I will burn you, you bastard.

516
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,080
John.

517
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,800
We need to go back.

518
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,040
Yeah, sure, love.

519
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,680
Why don't you really listen to her,
construction worker John?

520
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,360
I wanna see my mother.

521
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,920
You think your mother
will suddenly have

522
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,400
all of her memories?

523
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,680
What if Natalie is just a character
on a TV show, love?

524
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,840
I have to know for sure.

525
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,760
<i>Repress</i>

526
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,920

537
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,280
We're back.

538
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,200
And it's Christmas time, apparently.

539
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,280
Yep.

540
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,440
- There you two are.
- Mom.

541
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,720
My love.

542
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,360
What's all this?

543
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,880
Do you remember anything?

544
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,040
About your life
before Highcastle Abbey?

545
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,520
I...

546
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,240
London? Magic? Dad?

547
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,200
What on Earth are you talking about?

548
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,280
Nevermind.

549
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,240
I love you, Mom.

550
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,040
I love you too, you goose.

551
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,320
You come upstairs
and change for dinner.

552
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,640
Astra, listen to me.

553
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,280
I know what you're gonna say.

554
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,080
She's not real.

555
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,760
We can stay.

556
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,480
What?

557
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,240
- What are you playing at?
- It's no trick, love.

558
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,960
Astra, look at me.

559
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,320
What have I got to show for myself?

560
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,920
Thirty-eight crap years of pain
and broken promises.

561
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,400
You wanna know
what my original sin was?

562
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,840
It was you.

563
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:17,240
Astra, I rail against the angels
and the demons

564
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,360
for being arrogant bastards,

565
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,240
but I'm worse than
the bloody lot of them.

566
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,920
And I thought
that I could use your innocent soul

567
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,160
as a bargaining chip
to save your mother.

568
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,280
Bollocks.

569
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,920
If you're happy here,

570
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,280
then I will spend
an eternity as ruddy

571
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:38,440
Mr. Constantine trying
to make it up to you and Natalie.

572
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:45,000
Is John Constantine really capable
of such a selfless act?

573
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,320
Would it be acceptable
to dine at half past 7,

574
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,760
Lady Astra?

575
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,760
Mrs. Hutchins
is running a trifle late.

576
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,080
Perfectly acceptable,
Mr. Constantine.

577
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,760
That's one show back on track.

578
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,240
My algorithm
should take care of the rest.

579
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:25,080
But I don't understand.
Why are real people trapped on TV?

580
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,280
The Legends, they're my friends.

581
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,520
And my sisters wanted them dead.

582
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,600
So...

583
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,440
I made a deal.

584
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,760
Weave the Legends
into our streaming service,

585
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,880
where they help
indoctrinate the masses

586
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,960
and they could live.

587
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,080
I always thought of you
as the punk rock Fate.

588
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,080
I didn't have a choice.

589
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,800
Nobody does here.

590
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,640
But that's how it starts,
and then you get used to it.

591
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,480
Obeying, I mean.

592
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,520
Come on, we have to escape.

593
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,200
What's our course, Captains?

594
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,040
Sara, wait. Let's think about this.

595
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,120
What's there to think about?

596
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,480
We have to get back
to the real world.

597
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,400
I know, okay? Just...

598
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:16,880
In the real world, I saw you die.

599
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,960
Okay? And it...

600
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,800
It was awful.

601
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,400
And I just keep playing it over
and over again in my head, okay?

602
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,360
So, look, out there, we lost.

603
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,480
But in here, we always win, Sara.

604
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,040
Look, you're right.

605
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,240
Okay?
And that's why Charlie did all this.

606
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,360
A crew that can't die,
us beating the bad guys every time,

607
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,840
it's what we asked
for back there in the pub.

608
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,240
But it doesn't exist.

609
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:54,400
Ava, life is beautiful
and terrible all at the same time.

610
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,880
But if we're only living
part of it...

611
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,720
then we're not living at all.

612
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,800
Let's get the hell out of here.

613
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:12,160
Captains, I'm picking up
a strange transmission.

614
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,400
It's from your old enemy, Don.

615
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:19,080
<i>Captain Lance. Captain Sharpe.</i>

616
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,360
<i>Old friends.</i>

617
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,480
- He looks kinda hot.
- Mom.

618
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,000
What? I'm not dead.

619
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,480
That's gross.

620
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,880
So, that's where Rory's been?

621
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,320
<i>It was foolish to think
you could escape my wrath.</i>

622
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,320
Don's charging his torpedoes.

623
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,120
Should I raise the shields?

624
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,240
Hey, you... you said that
we always win, right?

625
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:44,440
What if the only way to get Charlie
to set us free is...

626
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,000
We have to lose.

627
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,400
What is she on about?

628
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,600
<i>You left me.</i>

629
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:54,960
<i>You left her
at the center of a dead planet.</i>

630
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah
just get to the revenge part.

631
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,400
<i>As you wish.</i>

632
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,520
Torpedoes incoming.

633
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,400
Should I take evasive maneuvers?

634
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,480
Negative, Officer Maala.

635
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,400
What if real people die
in the TV, Clotho?

636
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,040
You have to save them.

637
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:30,640
Torpedo impact in five,
four, three, two...

638
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,960
one.

639
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,040
No.

640
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,320
- What just happened?
- Did they die?

641
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,600
What did you do?

642
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,680
I canceled their show.

643
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,000
You idiots.
Have you any idea what you've done?

644
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,040
I loved Star Trip and my hair.

645
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,520
Wait, where are we?

646
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,520
And where are the others?

647
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,640
Darling.

648
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,160
But before we go in for dinner,
just open one present.

649
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:21,680
What's this?

650
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,360
I overheard you talking
to Lord Behrad earlier.

651
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,240
It's a ticket to London.

652
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,320
I don't understand.

653
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,520
I couldn't bear it if you sacrificed
your happiness for my own.

654
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:40,440
But, what about Highcastle Abbey?

655
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,320
Please, don't make me do this.
I can't say goodbye to you.

656
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,520
Darling, darling.

657
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,120
I'll always be here.

658
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,560
But you have your whole life
ahead of you.

659
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,360
Be courageous, my love.

660
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,760
Live it well.

661
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,360
Mr. Constantine.

662
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,080
Your ladyship.

663
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,360
Is Lady Astra
really leaving Highcastle?

664
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,440
Do I have to say it?

665
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,840
Say what, my lady?

666
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,200
You smug bastard.

667
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,600
We can't stay here.

668
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,800
Nat would be proud.

669
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,760
Do it fast before I change my mind.

670
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,840
(Foreign language)

671
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,040
John, you made it.

672
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,400
Yeah, just about.

673
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,160
What about the others?

674
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,960
Come on, Z.

675
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:03,960
You didn't live in a totem for a year
just to get stuck on a TV show.

676
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,560
I can't go back to eating mush again.

677
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,920
Not even blue mush.

678
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,120
Yeah, because no one should eat mush.

679
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,680
It's horrible.

680
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,640
And all the colors
are deeply unnatural.

681
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,160
And it has the texture of wet cement.

682
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,960
<i>But, Z, the Fates said
we all have to eat mush.</i>

683
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,120
<i>You know what, Nate?</i>

684
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,360
Screw the Fates.

685
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,240
Those imbeciles can't do this.

686
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,200
They'll inspire an insurrection.

687
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,160
- They're gonna get themselves
- They're gonna get themselves

688
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,240
- canceled.
- canceled.

689
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,520
For too long,
we've let the Fates rule our lives.

690
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:58,040
I happen to like mush,
but that's not the point.

691
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,840
Stop being so obedient.

692
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:06,160
Get off your couches
and take control of your lives.

693
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,040
So good to see you.

694
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,120
Hey.

695
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,280
- So nice to see you.
- It's so good.

696
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,240
So, hey,
that was pretty crazy back there.

697
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,040
We were, like, engaged.

698
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,160
It's a good thing
we're not brainwashed anymore.

699
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,880
Great. Out of the TV show,
still in heels.

700
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,160
<i>You morons!</i>

701
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,600
<i>You just couldn't leave it alone,
could you?</i>

702
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,800
I gave you everything
that you wanted.

703
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,720
You stuck us on TV.

704
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,480
I brought Sara
and Behrad back to life.

705
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,320
Mick, I made you a criminal again.

706
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,040
It's just like you wanted.

707
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,840
I even gave Astra a happy
childhood for you, John-o.

708
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,640
Yeah, bollocks. You just used us
to keep people under control.

709
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:56,720
<i>It's better that, than you lot dead.</i>

710
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,920
I still have your life threads.

711
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:02,920
I can put the shows back on air,
I'll do rewrites.

712
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,240
Behrad, you want the old Zari back?

713
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,720
I can do that. Look.

714
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,560
Behrad, is that really you?

715
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,600
You're alive.

716
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,680
- What's happening?
- Yeah, it's like a Zari clone.

717
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,880
I totally get it.

718
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,680
Wait, what? Two sisters?

719
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,000
Yeah, this is weird.

720
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,280
Good weird.

721
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,320
(Foreign language)

722
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,600
It's really you.

723
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,600
Charlie, you can't bribe us
into taking the blue pill.

724
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,480
I'm not bribing, I'm begging.

725
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:54,960
My sisters will kill you.

726
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,040
That's for sure.

727
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,280
Yeah, well, we'll take our chances.

728
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,200
Lita's out there somewhere.

729
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,200
I'm not staying here.

730
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,840
Let's get out of here.

731
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,880
Yeah, so long, Charlie.

732
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,880
Wait, just accept your fates.

733
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,400
Don't walk out that door.

734
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,920
On the other hand, why not?

735
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,080
They're free.

736
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,120
Then I can't help them anymore.
